Why not use a machine?\" And I've always been like, \"I don't know why I do it. It's just something that I do.\" But now I know -- because I've been training for this very day. I mean, wow! I am strong. And the omelet flipping definitely is part of it. You know when you use one of those really heavy cast-iron k*ll, and you flip, flip? That's all in the wrist, you know? And that's what they say. That's what people say about arm-wrestling, too - that it's all in the wrist, and, man, I have super-bionic, superpowered, super wrists.

But I didn't want a life separate from Luke, and that's all he could give me. I don't want that. If I'm gonna be with Luke, I want to be with Luke, and he didn't get it, and I waited. I mean, god, I waited. It's like Luke is driving a car, okay, and I just want to be in the passenger's seat. But he's locked the door, and and so I have to hold onto the bumper, you know? I'm not even asking him to open the door for me. Just leave it unlocked and say, \"come in.\" But no, he didn't do that, so I'm hanging onto the bumper, and life goes on, and the car goes on, and I get really badly bruised and hitting potholes.

      "LORELAI: Aw. How was the goodbye?\n",
      "RORY: Awful. There's nothing good about a goodbye. It's a very poorly named ritual. It was a bad bye, a very bad bye. Then I went to the newsroom to talk to Paris about it…\n",
      "LORELAI: You what?\n",
      "RORY: Well I didn't mean to. She was just there, and she spent like 10 minutes kicking me while I was down.\n",

      "LORELAI: [Sighs] Luke and I split up.\n",
      "RORY: What do you mean, like you got into a fight?\n",

      "LORELAI: Rory, please.\n",

      "LORELAI: Yeah. Who says we always have to be talking? We can not talk.\n",
      "RORY: Of course we can.\n",
      "LORELAI: Okay…We should probably talk about how we're not gonna talk, 'cause I don't think we should just go right into it.\n",
      "RORY: Let's do something that doesn't require talking. Like we could go to the movies.\n",
      "LORELAI: You want to try not talking at a movie?\n",
      "RORY: Okay, shopping.\n",
      "LORELAI: Are you mad?\n",

      "RORY: We haven't tried every sport.\n",
      "LORELAI: How about running?\n",
      "RORY: We could easily talk while we're running. Not if we were hurdling. Hurdles require more focus and, thus, less talking. Or we could do that running that's like you leap around a tree and up a hill…\n",
      "RORY: You want to run cross-country.\n",
      "LORELAI: Not across the whole country, maybe just Michigan.\n",
      "RORY: Michel, what sports do you play?\n",
      "MICHEL: Well, since I'm maimed potentially for life, I may never play sports again.\n",
      "LORELAI: But think back to before this tragic, life-altering injury, when life was still worth living What sports did you play then?\n",
      "MICHEL: Well, Pilates, of course.\n",
      "LORELAI: What?\n",
      "RORY: It's like yoga with cables and wires.\n",
      "LORELAI: Sounds very dangerous.\n",

Fortunately for the citizens of stars hollow, the fine people [Rory looks over to Luke's and Luke looks back, they wave to each other.] at Ingram traffic systems have provided an answer. I would now like to present the latest and greatest w*apon in unmanned high-tech law enforcement. Ladies and gentlemen, the Auto Patrol P.R. 100. [Applause] How it works is very simple. When someone drives through the red light, the camera will take three successive pictures of the offending party at closer and closer range.\n",

      "CHRISTOPHER: [On the phone] Lor, hey, it's me. Just still trying to reach you. Arr sorry I missed your call before. I wasn't calling about that whole \"Luke hitting me\" thing. I don't care about that. I just want to talk to you. I want to talk to you about the other night. You said it was just a one-night thing, but I want to talk about it, and about you and me, so... call me so we can talk. Okay. Bye. [call ends]\n",

      "LORELAI: Yeah. I did.\n",

      "LORELAI: No, honey. No, I... believe me, no. Um, Luke and I had broken up before.\n",
      "RORY: For how long? I mean it couldn't have been long. You and Luke have only been broken up for three days.\n",
      "LORELAI: Yeah, it was that night.\n",
      "RORY: The night you and Luke broke up. Wow. So you just rushed right over there the minute you were free, huh?\n",
      "LORELAI: Rory.\n",
      "RORY: Sounds like you were in quite a hurry did you put a dummy in the passenger seat so you could use the car-pool Lane?\n",
      "LORELAI: Rory.\n",

      "RORY: Mom, you slept with dad.\n",
      "LORELAI: For the love of god, will you stop saying that?\n",
      "RORY: No I can't stop saying it because it happened. And you're trying to pretend like it didn't.\n",
      "LORELAI: I'm not perfect, okay? People make mistakes. I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow dyed her hair that dark brown. It was very unflattering. If she's not perfect, how do you expect me to be?\n",
      "RORY: Yeah, because what you did is equivalent to dying your hair. That's great. Things were finally good between you two and between me and dad. Did you not care that things were really good between me and dad? I mean do you not want us to be close? Did you mean to ruin that?\n",
      "LORELAI: No! God, no! I love that dad's been good and that things with you and dad have been good. I...I was hurting. I was heartbroken. And...it happened. I slept with your dad. It's over now, and it was a mistake.\n",
      "RORY: I can't believe you didn't tell me this. I mean, first of all, you say you don't want to talk. So I figure you're going through some hard emotional time and you need some space. That's fine but what you didn't tell me is that you slept with dad. No, instead you're going around joking about, you know, origami and marshmallow sushi, like I'm some idiot 5-year-old.\n",
      "LORELAI: Rory, I was gonna tell you. I just wanted…\n",
      "RORY: You know what, mom? If you're heartbroken, rent \"An Affair to Remember,\" have a good cry, and drown your sorrows in a pint of ice cream. You get a hideously unflattering breakup haircut. You don't sleep with dad.\n",

If I were there for one more second, I think I would have had to karate-chop my mom. I swear, just chopped her in half. I guess I...[she sees Lane sitting on the floor] Lane, are you okay? Did the doctor say you have a parasite?\n",
      "LANE: In a manner of speaking. [Sighs] I'm pregnant.\n",

      "RORY: You're not.\n",
      "LANE: I am.\n",
      "RORY: Really?\n",
      "LANE: Really, I guess the combination of salt water and seaweed and discount Mexican condoms and terrible, terrible sex leads to a baby.\n",
      "RORY: A baby.\n",
      "LANE: A baby. Sex sucks so bad. Sex sucks worse than I thought.\n",
      "RORY: You only did it one time, and - wow, a baby.\n",

      "LANE: When the doctor told me, I started throwing up.\n",
      "RORY: Well you had morning sickness.\n",
      "LANE: This was a different kind of throwing up. This was the kind of throwing up that you do when you have to do something that you can't do.\n",
      "RORY: You're going to be a great mother.\n",
      "LANE: Maybe someday, but not now. I have a picture in my head of me as a mother. You know, I can imagine it, and in that picture, I'm wearing a skirt and heels, and my hair is up in a bun. I'm pushing one of those fancy British baby carriages that are called silver surfers or something.\n",
      "RORY: Very Madonna in her British-mommy phase.\n",
      "LANE: When I'm a mom, I'll be calm and wise and have my act together. I am not calm and not wise, and I really, really don't have my act together.\n",
      "RORY: You don't have to wear heels and push a pram to be a mother.\n",

      "RORY: Mothers don't have to know the word pram.\n",
      "LANE: Yes, they do! They have to know all sorts of things. They have to know what to do when your baby is crying and how to change a diaper and how to use your wrist to test if the bottle is too hot. Why the wrist? I don't know. I have no idea.\n",
      "RORY: Um, I think because it's handy, no pun intended, and um it's sensitive. Wrists are sensitive.\n",
      "LANE: It's just one false move, one misstep, and I'll ruin it. I'm still making mistakes, Rory. Example \"a\" - I'm pregnant. I can't be making mistakes when I'm a mother. I'm not the person I need to be to be able to do this. I'm not perfect yet. I'm so not perfect.\n",
      "RORY: You don't have to be perfect. I mean, even Gwyneth Paltrow makes mistakes, like \"Shallow Hal\" and that other movie that nobody saw where she played a stewardess. So who's perfect? Nobody. Not even mothers.\n",
      "LANE: Yeah…I'm scared.\n",
      "RORY: I know you are, but you can do this. First of all, you are great. And second of all, you have nine long months to study about bottles and wrists.\n",
      "LANE: That's true.\n",
      "RORY: And, already, you are way ahead of a lot of people as far as parenting k*ll go, like Britney. Britney Spears does not know which end of a baby goes up. And Courtney Love? She's no June Cleaver.\n",
      "LANE: Yeah I bet I could be a better mother than Courtney Love.\n",
      "RORY: My sock drawer could be a better mother. But, yes, of course you would be. And Michael Jackson - you know not to name a child \"blanket.\"\n",
      "LANE: I do know that. Do not name your baby after an inanimate object.\n",
      "RORY: See? Way ahead of the pack.\n",
      "LANE: Yeah. Hey... I wonder if um blanket ever met Tom and Katie's baby, Pillow.\n",
      "RORY: Yeah, that would be a perfect play date.\n",
      "LANE: Yeah, when it's nap time, they would be totally set.\n",
      "RORY: And then they could invite Gwyneth's Apple over afterward for a little snack.\n",
      "LANE: Banjo, Rachel Griffiths' baby, could play for them.\n",

      "LUKE: Were what?\n",
      "LIZ: You were never in sync. I don't mean that in a bad way.\n",
      "LUKE: What do you mean, we were never in sync?\n",
      "LIZ: Okay, for one thing, you never really moved in together. You wanted to, but you never did. You were in two different places.\n",
      "LUKE: Well, there was a logistical thing.\n",
      "LIZ: And then, when you found out you had a daughter, you never told her. That's not normal, Luke. That's not how people in a healthy relationship act. It's like that space-time-continuum thing. You're on a plane over here, and she's on this plane over there, and you were both never here nor there at the same time.\n",
      "T.J.: It's like string theory.\n",

      "T.J.: What house? It was a bus. Oh! I thought you were talking about \"Speed.\" \"Speed\" applies, too.\n",
      "LUKE: Lorelai and I didn't break up because we weren't on the same place in a space-time continuum or because there weren't any wormholes. We broke up because we weren't right for each other. Okay, it wasn't space. It wasn't time. It was us, okay? We didn't belong together. [Luke sounds like he is trying to convince himself] We never really... belonged together. We wanted to, but... we never did. That's it.\n",

      "RORY: Right. Dread, dread. I remember.\n",

[Emily voice] \"A pop-tart?!\" [normal voice] And so, I had one. And I opened the little silver wrapper, and I took a bite, and I thought nothing had ever tasted so good. I thought it tasted like freedom. It tasted like I was my own person. The pop-tart tasted like freedom and rebellion and independence.\n",

      "LORELAI: But now I think I don't know if I like pop-tarts. What if I don't like pop-tarts? Would I like pop-tarts if Richard and Emily had served me pop-tarts on a silver platter and demanded I eat every bite? I don't know.\n",

      "RORY: What's exciting?\n",
      "RICHARD: Well, when I was at my Yale class reunion, I had a chance to meet one of my former classmates, Harold Laken. You know him as the dean of undergraduate education. Harold was also a fellow Whiffenpoof.\n",
      "EMILY: The news, Richard!\n",
      "RICHARD: Yes, right well I-it seems there was a sudden vacancy in the economics department, and they need someone to teach a course this semester, and Harold immediately thought of me.\n",

      "EMILY: But, Richard, we have dinner with the Sudburys on Thursday. Remember? We're going to the hill house.\n",
      "RICHARD: Well, I'm sorry, Emily, but I have dinner with the dean, and you can't expect me to include the Sudburys in that. They are insufferable bores.\n",

Drug use, bullying, graffiti, theft, spitting, fighting – including but not limited to punching, kicking, gouging, and biting.

      "MISS PATTY: Nothing ever happens. Oh, except for that one time.\n",
      "LUKE: What one time?\n",
      "MISS PATTY: Well, I took my senior ballerinas to try out for a performance of \"The Nutcracker,\" and one of the girls pulled a Tonya Harding and knocked the front-runner for Clara out of the competition. Broke her leg in three places.\n",
      "LUKE: That is not nothing. That is the opposite of nothing.\n",
      "MISS PATTY: It's totally different. That was a much rougher crowd.\n",

Now, if you have a hanging bag for, like, dresses, you can just hang it in my closet, but I don't seem to remember you wearing a lot of dresses.\n",
      "APRIL: Not big on dresses.\n",
      "LUKE: All right, what else? Here's your kitchen, my bed, bathroom's back there, and the TV. I had a remote but I lost it, so you're gonna have to change the channel by hand by turning this knob here. And here's the telephone. If you're on it and you hear a beeping sound, that's call-waiting, so you've got to hit the flash button to switch over to the other call.\n",

      "BILL: Slugline's half the battle.\n",
      "PARIS: Dormitory renovations -- that's quaint. I recently had the opportunity to be a fly on the wall at the Hartford Courant as the editor selected their lead story. It was down to the wire, and I was on the edge of my seat when right at the last second, a local-corruption story broke. It was thrilling. It made this place look like a joke.\n",
      "RORY: Your point, Paris?\n",
      "PARIS: Oh, I thought I was clear. Compared to the courant, this place is a joke.\n",

      "RORY: And until about three hours ago, I thought that she was a guy. You know why? Because you never use personal pronouns -- \"she,\" \"her.\" I mean, would that have been so unbelievably difficult to fit into a conversation? I don't know about you, but most of the Bobby's I know are guys -- Bobby Kennedy, Bobby Brady, Bobby Knight, Bobby Brown. You're smiling at me. Why are smiling at me?\n",

      "LOGAN: Mayfly.\n",
      "RORY: I can't just live in the moment and enjoy the 26 great hours ahead of me? I have to be sulky and miserable while all the other fruit flies share private jokes with my boyfriend? You think I like this about myself? Wrong. I hate myself for being this way. I hate Bobbi for her professionally tweezed eyebrows and her oh-so-incredible ability to stand up at a moment's notice. And most of all, I hate the fact that in a few seconds you'll be in that car leaving me again.\n",

      "LOGAN: You know that space we've been trying to book for our launch party?\n",
      "RORY: The orchid room.\n",
      "LOGAN: Yeah, the problem is, it's booked till like 2008, or it was until Nadine Maybrooke broke up with Jamie Erman, thus canceling their engagement party and freeing the space up tonight.\n",
      "RORY: Poor Nadine and Jamie.\n",
      "LOGAN: Hey, I invited them. The more the merrier, it's gonna be hugh.\n",
      "RORY: So, you're having your launch party tonight.\n",
      "LOGAN: Well, actually, it's our prelaunch launch party. Our launch party will take more than 48 hours to plan. It starts at 9:00. You can be there, right?\n",
      "RORY: Oh yeah I'm having dinner with my parents, but I can stop by right after.\n",
      "LORELAI: When did they get back from France?\n",
      "RORY: Last night. I would just skip it, but my mom really wants to see me and, apparently, make me snails.\n",
      "LOGAN: Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you post-snails. It should be a pretty good time. We've got a huge guest list. Bobbi's pulled out all the stops. She's she's contracted five of the hottest P.R. Agents in the city and has them hunkered in a w*r room. I'd be surprised if she lets them take bathroom breaks.\n",
      "RORY: hum you can't stop Bobbi.\n",
      "LOGAN: Ace.\n",
      "RORY: What, no, I like Bobbi. I do. I don't like the fact that she's not a big, swarthy dude. But I recognize that my issues with Bobbi have nothing to do with her. She's lovely, she's you colleague It doesn't matter that her legs come up to my nose.\n",
      "LOGAN: \"A big, swarthy dude\"?\n",
      "RORY: With a cheesy goatee.\n",
      "LOGAN: Well, maybe she'll agree to the goatee. And, hey, you want to come with me tomorrow and check out apartments?\n",
      "RORY: Apartment, like, to live in?\n",
      "LOGAN: I know it is cliché, but, yes, I intend to live in my apartment.\n",

      "LOGAN: Actually an hour and 20 minutes.\n",

      "RORY: But why do you have to get your own apartment, why can't you just live here with me?\n",
      "LOGAN: I'd love to, ace, but I think I'd end up seeing more of the I-95 than I would of you. I mean my hours are gonna be crazy. If I live near the office, I can crawl home at 3:00 in the morning and crawl back to work at 7:00.\n",
      "RORY: That's a lot of crawling.\n",
      "LOGAN: It just doesn't make sense logistically.\n",
      "RORY: So it's just gonna be me here?\n",
      "LOGAN: Well you were gonna live here by yourself anyway.\n",
      "RORY: I know, but if you're gonna have your whole new apartment, then you're gonna need all your stuff.\n",
      "LOGAN: Don't worry I'm not gonna clean you out, ace.\n",
      "RORY: I'll be fine. Take your stuff.\n",
      "LOGAN: It's not gonna happen, new apartment, new stuff.\n",
      "RORY: Really?\n",
      "LOGAN: Yeah. I-I want a fresh start.\n",
      "RORY: Hey well I mean, you should take some of your stuff, like your favorite stuff.\n",
      "LOGAN: Like what?\n",
      "RORY: Like, you know, you can't live without your suit of armor, can you? I mean you really want to take that.\n",
      "LOGAN: You don't like Henry?\n",
      "RORY: Well it's not that I don't like Henry it's just that he creeps me out.\n",
      "LOGAN: Oh man now you just hurt Henry's feelings.\n",
      "RORY: Well he's gonna have to grow a little tougher chain mail then if he's gonna make it on the mean streets of New York.\n",

      "LORELAI: Well we rebuilt it a couple years ago, but now it's started to rot.\n",
      "CHRISTOPHER: Oh yeah.\n",
      "LORELAI: Yeah, it's too bad, too, 'cause it was gorgeous. We all loved, loved, loved it. It was sturdy and strong, made out of this beautiful Japanese maple – which it turns out is exactly the kind of wood that attracts beetles, and I'm not talking British-invasion kinda b*at. I'm talking the kind of beetles that like to eat wood. So now we're gonna make it out of a less-delicious wood.\n",

      "LORELAI: To you and me. I mean, I just want to be sensitive, you know? You're not who they expected, and I-I just don't want the marriage to seem sudden. You know I-I want to kind of ease them into it.\n",
      "CHRISTOPHER: Is that why you didn't want to invite any of your friends to your mother's party?\n",
      "LORELAI: No. Well, I mean yeah, but 90% of it was I didn't want them to have to deal with salsa dancing and the Peabody's and the Sandborn's. You know but I guess 10% is I didn't want to feel like I'm shoving our marriage down their throats.\n",
      "CHRISTOPHER: By inviting them to a party?\n",

      "LUKE: My sister is gonna have her baby at home?\n",
      "T.J.: [Takes a drink] She got the idea from -- phew! -- Marcy hedges, who plays the midwife at the renaissance festivals. Only Marcy has five kids -- all born in hospitals -- and now she's telling Liz how amazing and natural it is for her to do it at home.\n",
      "LUKE: This is crazy.\n",
      "T.J.: Liz said she had Jess at a hospital, and she wants to have this one at home. She has this a, birth coach, called a Doula. That's not her real name. Don't call her that. She's very touchy. Her real name is Sandy.\n",
      "LUKE: Okay. Sandy the doula.\n",
      "T.J.: Anyway, Sandy's done about 200 of these home births, and she says statistically, they're every bit as safe as hospital births.\n",
      "LUKE: I can't believe she's having her baby at home.\n",
      "T.J.: Anyway, she wants you to be there at the birth. She wants the baby to be born around family. So I promised I'd get you to come.\n",
      "LUKE: Of course. Sure I'll be there. Just call me whenever, and I'll come right by.\n",

      "LORELAI: No, the pants alarm, pants alarm sounds more like a siren.\n",

      "LORELAI: No, no…\n",
      "BABETTE: We could just…\n",

      "BABETTE: Oh, this is gonna be good, what with this one here and the two palms. Oh, boy, Morey's eyes are gonna pop out of his head!\n",

      "LORELAI: Oh, boy! Is this heavy!\n",
      "BABETTE: It is. It is. I'm sorry, doll. I wasn't hoping that you would lug this with me. I was planning on asking Christopher.\n",

      "LORELAI: Yeah, he's a man of mystery.\n",
      "BABETTE: Ohh, you know who's a man of mystery? Morey. [Lorelai cell phone rings] After decades in the bedroom, who would have thought that the idea of dressing up like a Howler monkey would be such a turn-on?\n",

      "RORY: Hey. [Exhales deeply] Um, they're doing tests, so that's where he is -- blood tests and another E.K.G. They did an E.K.G. In the ambulance, but I guess they're still trying to determine how much damage was actually caused by the heart attack. But that's definitely what it was. It was a myocardial infarction, which is a heart attack. And I guess the E.K.G. Tells them how bad the blockage of his arteries is and what degree of coronary-artery disease he has, or C.A.D., As they're calling it, because, apparently, everything is -- what do you call it? An anagram? What's the thing with the letters? Acronym. The C.A.D., C.I.C.U., The E.K.G.\n",

At John Skinner Medical Center. It's on the first floor, and there's a red stripe running down the hallway. Just please call me when you get this, okay? Thanks.

      "RORY: Oh, okay. And what about dad?\n",
      "LORELAI: Oh, he's probably... en route.\n",

      "LORELAI: I know.\n",
      "RORY: But it's not.\n",
      "LORELAI: No I mean it's a nightmare but not a nightmare nightmare. I know ‘cause I have shoes on. In my nightmares, I never am wearing shoes.\n",
      "RORY: I didn't know that.\n",
      "LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, It's the worst thing in the dream, too. I could be chased by snakes or in a nuclear expl*si*n, but then I look down, and, \"oh, my god! I'm not wearing shoes!\"\n",
      "RORY: I wonder what that means.\n",
      "LORELAI: Well it probably means I have a fear of you know hurting my bare feet or fear of losing my shoes.\n",

      "LORELAI: Good.\n",
      "DR. GOLDSTEIN: We just sent him to the cath lab to get an angiogram. After that, we should be able to get a better sense of what kind of blockage is around his heart. And then we'll figure out where to go from there.\n",

      "DR. GOLDSTEIN: Uh, pardon?\n",
      "LORELAI: I mean, where -- where would we go?\n",

      "NURSE: I'm sorry he's in the cath lab right now getting an angiogram. But the doctor will come find you as soon as they're done.\n",
      "EMILY: There's no need to be cheery about it.\n",

      "EMILY: Honestly someone with your chipper personality ought to be a weather girl or a preschool teacher.\n",

      "[Emily walks off and Lorelai mouths \"I'm Sorry\" to the nurse]\n",
      "EMILY: What happened to all the competent people? That's what I'd like to know. Was there some giant hole they all fell into or a virus that struck them all down, leaving the morons of the world to sit behind the desks?\n",
      "LORELAI: Mum wouldn't you like to sit down, have a cup of tea?\n",
      "EMILY: I don't want a cup of tea, what I want is the most perfunctory level of competence from the people with whom I interact. That apparently is far too much to ask for.\n",
      "RORY: Grandma we have snacks.\n",
      "LORELAI: Yes mum, snacks. We have salty snacks and sweet snacks and sweet/salty hybrid snacks.\n",
      "EMILY: I mean even at the club, I'm tell you the young men and women that work there must have a combined I.Q. Of a grapefruit. You ask them for a towel, and they look at you with the most vacant eyes. I'm telling you I thought the girl at reception was blind the entire first month she worked there – blind but very enthusiastic about the application of eyeliner.\n",
      "LORELAI: Sounds pretty.\n",
      "EMILY: My husband has a heart attack, and how long does it take them to find me? 40 minutes. The nitwit probably got lost between the front desk and the tennis courts.\n",
      "RORY: I'm sorry grandma that sounds terrible.\n",
      "EMILY: I mean none of this would have been a problem if I'd been allowed to keep my cell phone. But no cell phones have been banned allegedly because of noise pollution. Well if that's the reason, they should ban John Abbott. Because I'm telling you every time that man hits a ball, he grunts like a rutting hog. [The girls look amused] I mean he's twice as loud as my cell phone. And they won't even let you leave your cell phone on vibrate, it preposterous. I mean what do they think we're doing, making drug deals?\n",
      "LORELAI: I doubt that's it.\n",
      "EMILY: Which, by the way, are absolutely, 100% taking place. I saw Devorah Inwood handing Cardum Kelly a small, blue pill in the ladies' locker room while they made shady eyes at each other.\n",
      "LORELAI: Drug deals at the club? Mum I don't think so.\n",
      "EMILY: Absolutely. The whole place is going to the dogs. Oh, and now apparently they want to start charging us for meals, on top of the king's ransom in dues. It's appalling. I mean the very idea of charging extra for the junk they serve there. Oh, and you know what really irks me?\n",
      "LORELAI: Hmm?\n",
      "EMILY: They very rarely serve fish.\n",
      "LORELAI: That's terrible, especially for people who love fish.\n",

      "LORELAI: Mum what do you mean?\n",
      "EMILY: 2 1/2 months ago, I read an article that said fish has been shown to prevent heart attacks and stroke and has innumerable other health benefits.\n",

      "EMILY: It's the omega-3 fatty acids -- that and it's an incredibly lean source of protein. So I had the maid cut out the article so I could show it to Richard. He agreed to eat more fish, but he said not for dinner. My spineless kitchen staff caved.\n",

There was a tree in our yard I would always climb, and one day, I climbed up really, really high. Dad came home from work. I watched him go into the house. I thought, \"he looks so small.\" It was so strange to see him look like that. Um...[Sighs, the phone beeps for call waiting] Anyway, I should go, but, uh... call me when you get this, okay? Bye.

The point is there are fights you can recover from and fights you can't, and not going to your daughter's baby shower -- I mean, I know it's hard, but I don't want you to draw a line in the sand now that you can't cross later.

      "ZACH: Okay here's the thing -- Lane asked me to ask you about tomorrow a long time ago, and I kind of forgot, so she'd be mad if you canceled last minute.\n",
      "LUKE: I'm not canceling -- I haven't accepted.\n",
      "ZACH: Well let's not get into semantics. It would just be a bummer if you bailed. ‘Cause she's been cooking for like two days.\n",

      "ZACH: Now, Lane -- she loves to talk in the morning. Lots of morning chin music with that one. Not me. I take not talking over talking any day. [Starts putting source dispensers out on the counter, one falls.] Ooh, awesome catch.\n",
      "LUKE: Thanks.\n",
      "ZACH: Pretty obvious you played some ball.\n",
      "LUKE: A little.\n",
      "ZACH: I didn't really get into sports much. My dad didn't do sports with me when I was little, and then he, you know, split.\n",
      "LUKE: Yeah, you said. That's too bad.\n",
      "ZACH: Yeah. What kind of music you into?\n",
      "LUKE: I don't really listen to much music.\n",
      "ZACH: No?\n",
      "LUKE: I mean if I'm driving around in my truck, I'll, you know, maybe put on an oldies station. I like some Motown.\n",
      "ZACH: Oh dude I know the perfect band for you. You would so get off on them. They're young, but their sound is way borrowed from those old guys from the '70s.\n",
      "LUKE: Listen, I got to fire up the stoves.\n",
      "ZACH: Yeah, go, go. Fire 'em up.\n",
      "LUKE: You know, I can't pay you any extra 'cause you came in early.\n",
      "ZACH: Oh, yeah, I know. I just figure it's part of my job, and it's a chance for us to hang out. Plus, you know... [quietly] the quiet.\n",

      "LORELAI: Well, that's okay. Mia leaves the door open. She likes people to just come on in.\n",
      "RORY: She's probably too busy to greet everybody, grandma.\n",
      "EMILY: Well, of course she is. She should have someone greet people for her.\n",
      "RORY: Oh, look at all these great pictures.\n",
      "LORELAI: Not everyone has a maid, you know, mom.\n",
      "EMILY: How hard is it to hire a maid for the day?\n",
      "LORELAI: Well, last I checked, they didn't have them at Bed Bath & Beyond.\n",
      "RORY: Oh, this must be Howard. Look. Here we are.\n",
      "LORELAI: Oh so cute. That's the rug where you used to spin around at the independence inn. I bet you threw up just seconds after that picture was taken.\n",
      "RORY: Yep.\n",
      "EMILY: Are we going in, or are we going to watch from the entryway?\n",

      "MIA: Did you find it all right?\n",
      "LORELAI: Yeah, mom's got the GPS. Apparently, it's great if you know how to use it.\n",
      "RORY: Yeah, we saw a lot of your neighborhood -- very nice.\n",
      "MIA: Oh, those damn GPS drive me crazy. Whatever happened to asking the guy at the gas station?\n",
      "EMILY: Good question. Hello, Mia. Thank you so much for inviting me to this special occasion.\n",
      "[They hold hands]\n",
      "MIA: Emily, I'm so glad you could be here. Well, let's go in. Let's not just stand here. I know a wedding wasn't what you had in mind when you came down here.\n",
      "EMILY: What I had in mind was spending time with my daughter and granddaughter, wherever.\n",
      "MIA: Oh, will you sign my guest book, please?\n",
      "EMILY: Oh certainly.\n",
      "MIA: I just feel so lucky to have all the Gilmore ladies under one roof.\n",
      "EMILY: Speaking of roofs, you have a charming home.\n",
      "MIA: Oh, thank you.\n",
      "EMILY: I'm always amazed at what good taste can do with a small space.\n",
      "LORELAI: Oh, it is beautiful.\n",
      "RORY: Yeah, so many personal touches everywhere.\n",
      "MIA: Thank you. I agree with Emily. It's a small house, and it's made even smaller by Howard's junk. But you know what they say -- you marry a man, you marry his junk. Howard.\n",
      "HOWARD: Mia…\n",
      "MIA: Howard, Howard. This is Emily Gilmore, the mother and grandmother of the famous Lorelai and Rory.\n",

      "MIA: Uh-oh! [covers Howard's eyes]\n",
      "[Laughter]\n",
      "RORY: Yeah, and if the bride sees a lizard crossing the road, that's bad news, too.\n",
      "LORELAI: Really!\n",
      "MIA: Oh, well, haven't seen a lizard, but too late for the dress, 'cause Howard zipped me up.\n",
      "LORELAI: Oh no, where's the zip-up on the bad-luck-o-meter?\n",
      "RORY: Not sure, but I'd throw some salt over your shoulders just in case.\n",
      "LORELAI: I don't have any salt. I might have some Splenda.\n",
      "HOWARD: You are exactly as Mia described you -- you both are. And believe me, she described you a lot.\n",
      "LORELAI: Well, I hope she left out the bad stuff.\n",

      "LORELAI: And so, a toast to you, dear Mia. It makes us all so glad to see ya... blissfully joined with dear, good Howard. May your love last long, like it's battery-powered. [Laughter] Rory and I wanted to do a poem for you, because when Rory was little, she used to love making up poems, and we would perform them for you, and that was such a fun time. [noticing Emily looking uncomfortable] Um... uh, so, what I've realized now is that you can get away with a lot of bad rhymes when you're cute and 5. But we do want to say...\n",
      "EMILY: [Too another guest] Excuse me would you mind terribly getting me a glass of water?\n",
      "LORELAI: ...The best things in life are worth waiting for, even if they take a long time...\n",

      "RORY: How did you know where I was?\n",
      "LOGAN: I called Paris, she found the invitation. I kept trying your cell, but you didn't pick up.\n",
      "RORY: Well, that's the advantage of caller I.D.\n",
      "LOGAN: I get it. You're still mad.\n",
      "RORY: No kidding.\n",
      "LOGAN: But now I'm here, so you have to talk to me – that's the advantage of showing up in person.\n",
      "RORY: Wow, I can't believe you're still doing this. This is so last year's Logan.\n",
      "LOGAN: What?\n",
      "RORY: You think you can just fly anywhere I am and overwhelm me by just showing up and -- I'm just not impressed anymore by your grand gestures.\n",
      "LOGAN: I'm not trying to impress you Rory. I just want to tell you what I've been thinking.\n",
      "RORY: Well I don't care…\n",
      "LOGAN: And I wanted to see you.\n",
      "RORY: I'm in the middle of a wedding of a close friend. I don't have time to stand here and listen to you explain your stupid immature behavior.\n",
      "LOGAN: If you would just hear me out.\n",
      "RORY: No, you go blow off steam in Vegas, you gamble away thousands of dollars, you drink all night, and do god knows what else. This is me blowing off steam.\n",
      "HOWARD: I'm sorry to interrupt, Rory, but Mia wanted me to tell you we're about to cut the cake.\n",

      "ZACH: Okay, bowl of chili, two dogs, one BLT, shepherd's pie, and a mushroom soup. And those guys in the corner were asking me if I had a pack of lucky strikes or a burger to spare, what's that about?\n",
      "LUKE: Bowling humor -- strikes, spares. Never gets old, guys.\n",
      "ZACH: Oh, I totally missed it. Oh, man!\n",
      "LUKE: What's wrong?\n",
      "ZACH: Last night, I made this mix of tunes that I thought would be right up your alley.\n",
      "LUKE: Okay.\n",
      "ZACH: Well, you know, new stuff that sounds kind of classic rock-y -- My Morning Jacket, who are like Neil Young reborn, if Neil would have, you know, died.\n",
      "LUKE: Uh-ha Wolfmother – definitely channeling Zeppelin -- modern, but not so much that it would freak out somebody of your taste.\n",
      "LUKE: The point.\n",
      "ZACH: The point is, I totally forgot to bring it.\n",
      "LUKE: Oh, don't worry about it.\n",
      "ZACH: Yeah, but I spent, like, all night on it.\n",
      "LUKE: Ah that's nice.\n",
      "ZACH: Gave me something to do instead of sitting around, waiting for Lane to pop out the babies.\n",
      "LUKE: It'll happen.\n",

      "LUKE: Ahh…\n",

      "LUKE: Right.\n",
      "ZACH: Right, so, you being a guy, I figured I could use your input on this.\n",

      "LUKE: Probably not the right time to be talking about gashed heads and circumcisions.\n",

I had so much invested in it in every way that, when it all collapsed, it was like I fell into this hole I couldn't pull myself out of. And I also realized that my dad was right. He had every reason to be pissed at me. I mean, I would have fired me for what I did. So, I decided the only way to fix this is to not be my dad's employee anymore.\n",

It's just a precautionary device. If it works, great. If not, I need it to open letters anyway. I don't know which to open first. Choose one.\n",

      "RORY: I'd say we're just as impressed. Wouldn't you, Doyle?\n",

The guy actually doesn't live too far from here, so I went to see it. It looks like it's in pretty good shape. So I ran the VIN number. It's got a clean history -- no accidents, no failed emissions. And the guy said he kept it up pretty good, and there's nothing really wrong with it. So I took it for a test drive, and it drove fine. So if you want to keep your old car, for whatever crazy feeling it gives you, okay? Then buy this guy's car, send it to gypsy. She'll take the engine out, put it in the old car, which makes absolutely no sense because you'd basically be paying the same amount of money to fix your old car as you would be paying to get into a new one.\n",

      "LORELAI: Speaking of which, do you think you can get some more graduation tickets? It seems like the whole of stars hollow wants to come.\n",

      "LORELAI: Oh, no. Anything on the black market?\n",
      "RORY: No I think we're probably priced out of that.\n",
      "LORELAI: All right well, you do know the house is gonna get egged.\n",
      "RORY: I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I'll help you scrub it when I get home.\n",

      "RORY: What?\n",
      "LORELAI: Yeah I must have completely embarrassed him, in addition to completely embarrassing myself. I've given you the \"don't drink to excess\" speech, right?\n",

      "LORELAI: Yeah what happened?\n",
      "MISS PATTY: I heard you slipped in the tub.\n",
      "TAYLOR: That's right, I did. Let that be a lesson to all of you. Bathroom safety is a serious business. One can never be too careful. Now, onto…\n",
      "GYPSY: I thought the paramedics found you in your living room.\n",
      "TAYLOR: Well, yes. The tub was, in fact, a pedi-spa. I have bunions, and I was soaking, but it still was exceedingly slippery. Onto the next order of business. Our esteemed friend and neighbor Kirk would like a permit to do his performance-art piece called \"Kirk-in-a-box\" in the town square.\n",
      "KIRK: It isn't a performance-art piece. It is a feat of endurance -- an attempt to stretch the bounds of human possibility.\n",

      "LORELAI: Like David Blaine.\n",
      "KIRK: Not at all. My box is smaller.\n",
      "BABETTE: Why?\n",
      "KIRK: Because Lucite is very costly.\n",
      "BABETTE: No. Why are you doing it?\n",
      "KIRK: To see if I can.\n",
      "TAYLOR: Let me point out that something like this could draw a crowd.\n",
      "GYPSY: Hey if Kirk wants to sit in a box, let him sit in a box.\n",
      "MOREY: Yeah, what do we care?\n",

      "LORELAI: No, no, no. Taylor, we don't have to do that.\n",
      "TAYLOR: Too late. It's already been added. Lorelai, state your case.\n",
      "LORELAI: I don't have a case.\n",
      "TAYLOR: Fine. Then just explain how this mishap occurred.\n",
      "LORELAI: What mishap?\n",
      "TAYLOR: Clearly, you dropped the ball.\n",
      "LORELAI: I didn't. They get four per kid. That's how it works. What could I do? I tried.\n",
      "TAYLOR: Were there no orphans, no children of divorce? Are you telling me that every single student at Yale has at least four people coming to see him or her graduate?\n",
      "LORELAI: Look, I'm sorry okay, but you'll all get a chance to congratulate her at the graduation party I'm having at my house in a week.\n",
      "BABETTE: But it's not the same thing. We've all known the kid since she was that high. We want to see that special moment when she gets handed her diploma.\n",
      "LORELAI: I'm really sorry, guys. I mean maybe I could hand her the diploma again you know, at the party at my house.\n",
      "BABETTE: You would do that?\n",
      "LORELAI: Of course.\n",
      "GYPSY: Well what about the music? You can't have the pomp without the circumstance.\n",
      "TAYLOR: That's an easy one to solve. The stars hollow high school band will play. It will be a wonderful dress rehearsal for their own ceremony in two weeks.\n",
      "[All Yeah!]\n",
      "LORELAI: I don't know if I can fit the whole band inside the house.\n",
      "TAYLOR: Absolutely not -- your house is not zoned for gatherings larger than 15 people. We'll do it in the town square.\n",

      "LORELAI: Oh, that sounds…\n",
      "KIRK: Lulu can play Rory. She's a terrific actress.\n",
      "RORY: What are you, nuts? No way. Rory's gonna play Rory.\n",
      "BABETTE: Oh, and at the ceremony at Yale, don't forget to take a lot of pictures, 'cause then we can blow them up for the re-enactment!\n",
      "LORELAI: [Looking worried] Uh, uh, okay.\n",

It's amazing. I just -- it's so -- oh, I'm on the verge of gushing, so I'm just gonna stop myself here. I don't want to gush, except one more thing -- to my mom, who is just everything to me and everything I am and who I'm gonna miss so much.\n",

      "LORELAI: I guess I'll eat later.\n",
      "EMILY: Now, listen, instead of a spa, what about a tennis court? People love tennis. You could put a bubble over it.\n",
      "LORELAI: Oh, god.\n",
      "EMILY: Outside the inn you could use it during the summer and winter. There's really no downside.\n",
      "LORELAI: Um-hmm.\n",
      "EMILY: Now it's expensive, but your father and I have discussed it, and we are willing to loan you the money.\n",
      "LORELAI: Oh, mother.\n",
      "EMILY: Standard terms, no interest.\n",
      "LORELAI: Mom, why do you want to loan me money?\n",
      "EMILY: All it would require is the three of us sit down and hash out the details. Obviously we want to get together with you from time to time to see how things are progressing, but we wouldn't become pests about it.\n",
      "LORELAI: Mom, why don't we just talk about it Friday night at dinner?\n",
      "EMILY: Oh, so our Friday-night dinners are going to continue, then?\n",
      "LORELAI: Well, we might as well. I've kind of gotten used to it.\n",
      "EMILY: All right. That sounds fine. But don't be late and don't wear jeans.\n",
      "LORELAI: When have I ever worn jeans to dinner?\n",
      "EMILY: Well I don't know, it could very well be Rory who enforces the dress code. I'm just saying I don't think that jeans are appropriate.\n",
      "LORELAI: Fine, spandex and a tube top it is.\n",
      "RORY: Hey.\n",

      "LORELAI: What?\n",
      "SOOKIE: He made me promise not to tell you, but I don't care. This is all Luke. He did all of it. He's the one that came to me and said, \"let's do the party,\" and then he planned the secret town meeting, everything.\n",
      "LORELAI: Really?\n",
      "SOOKIE: Yeah. I mean last night when we thought it was gonna rain and we'd have to cancel the party, he went around and collected everybody's tarps and tents and raincoats. I don't know how he did it. He must have stayed up all night doing this. Can you believe that?\n",
      "LORELAI: Yeah… I'll be back.\n",

I thought I had all summer to impart my wisdom about work and life and your future, and I feel like I had something to tell you. Oh, on the bus, make sure you choose a good seat, you know because people are creatures of habit, and the seat you pick in the beginning could be your seat for the rest of the year. You know. Get a window seat, honey, 'cause there's so much to see. And you might want to sit in the back, because people there tend to be more chatty and friendly and -- I don't know what it is about the front of the bus, you know but people there just tend to be a little more bossy and uptight. It's just been that way since first grade. And, honey, I know what you're gonna say, but just don't wear shorts, okay no matter how hot it is. It's not professional, and all that heat and those sticky vinyl seats -- it'll be like ripping a band-aid off your thigh every time you stand up. Don't be too shy. Don't be too forward, but don't be too shy, 'cause you make a lovely first impression, but you really grow on people, too.\n",
