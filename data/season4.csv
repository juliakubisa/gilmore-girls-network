"OPEN AT YALE DORM"
"[There's a knock on the door of Rory's suite. Rory opens it and Lorelai is there, holding a box and a rolled-up rug]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what's great about you going off to college?"
"RORY: My newfound independence?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no. My new batch of youth-oriented catalogs. For example, where on Earth could I put this fabulous purple flowered rug? It's so young and cool but doesn't really go with my room, so. . ."
"RORY: My room."
"LORELAI: Ooh! The matching beanbag chair arrives next week."
"RORY: I love it when you miss me."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's not that I miss you. It's just since you've been gone, I finally realized how the living room stayed so clean."
"RORY: Mmhmm. What do you think?"
"LORELAI: It works."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: You're welcome. So, Sookie sent marshmallow cookies, Luke sent muffins, and I got you a copy of the Stars Hollow Gazette."
"RORY: You don't have to bring that to me anymore. I subscribed."
"LORELAI: You subscribed to the Stars Hollow Gazette? The editor of the Stars Hollow Gazette does not subscribe to the Stars Hollow Gazette."
"RORY: I didn't want to get cut off from the town."
"LORELAI: That's very sweet of you. Hey, you wanna grab some coffee before I head back?"
"RORY: Can't."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: It's shopping week."
"LORELAI: Isn't it always?"
"RORY: The first week of school is called shopping week. You get to try out as many classes as you want before you pick the ones you want to stick with for the semester. I picked over fifty classes I'm gonna try out, plus another ten I'm gonna squeeze in if I have the time. They all sound completely amazing. I stayed up all night reading the class subscriptions over and over."
"LORELAI: You do know that if you weren't so pretty, you would've gotten the crap kicked out of you every day of your life."
"RORY: Walk me out?"
"LORELAI: Because you need the protection. Hey, what time's your first class?"
"RORY: Oh, you know, soon."
"LORELAI: Uh oh."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You're not gonna rush to your first class and get there like an hour early, are you?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: You are."
"RORY: I am not."
"LORELAI: When you started elementary school, you told me the teacher wanted to meet all the parents at 6:30, and when we got there, the school wasn't open yet."
"RORY: I did that once."
"LORELAI: No, you got away with it once. You tried it every year."
"RORY: I'm not gonna be early."
"LORELAI: You know, if you took all the time you wasted being early for things. . . [she looks around the room]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: My mother was here."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: My mother - she was here. I can feel it."
"RORY: Grandma hasn't been here."
"LORELAI: Smell that?"
"RORY: Smell what?"
"LORELAI: The room - it smells like guilt and Chanel No. 5."
"RORY: Mom, I'm telling you, you're wrong."
"LORELAI: You put the coffee table like that?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"RORY: I have three other roommates. One of them probably did it."
"LORELAI: Three roommates?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: When'd the other one come?"
"RORY: Last night. Her name's Janet."
"LORELAI: What's she like?"
"RORY: She jogs."
"LORELAI: Enough said."
"RORY: Come on, let's go."
"LORELAI: You seriously don't smell that?"
"RORY: We can get one cup of coffee, and then I have to get to class."
"LORELAI: I knew you were early."
"RORY: I'm not that early."
"[they walk out of the room. Lorelai sticks her head back in and sniffs]"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO YALE CLASSROOM"
"[Rory walks into an empty classroom and sits down. She's very early for her class. She starts to leave, but another student walks in, so she stays. A teacher walks in and hands out some papers]"
"TEACHER: Freshmen."
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the kitchen table going over some paperwork.]"
"LORELAI: Sign and date."
"SOOKIE: Signing and dating."
"LORELAI: Oh, do you have your last check stub?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah. Uh, here. Oh, remember that?"
"LORELAI: Income."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Those were the days, huh? Okay, my hand is cramping, and I'm done signing now."
"JACKSON: Sookie, can you hand me that screwdriver?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, um, tomorrow we have to meet with Ted Oldaman and get our liability insurance instated before we can break ground on the inn. And that reminds me. . .um, Tom sent over the initial proposal for the work."
"SOOKIE: How much?"
"LORELAI: I'll tell you later."
"SOOKIE: When?"
"LORELAI: After you blow."
"SOOKIE: Come on."
"LORELAI: Once you have the baby, then you can have the cow."
"JACKSON: Okay, I think I got it."
"SOOKIE: Is it really that much?"
"JACKSON: Here. I'm going to the nursery."
"LORELAI: Uh, it's $20,000 more than we thought."
"SOOKIE: $20,000? That sucks."
"LORELAI: I got the chimney report back."
"SOOKIE: Oh, sh**t."
"[Jackson's voice comes over a speaker]"
"JACKSON: Hello? Hello?"
"LORELAI: What is that?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson. He's trying to hook up the house's central sound system to the baby monitor."
"JACKSON: I am in the baby's room. I repeat, I am in the baby's room. Copy that."
"LORELAI: This is probably the cutest creepy thing he's done yet."
"JACKSON: Can anyone hear me? I repeat, can anyone hear me?"
"LORELAI: Yes, Jackson!"
"SOOKIE: You're supposed to use the walkie-talkie. [she speaks into the walkie talkie] Roger, roger, Jackson. We're receiving some feedback. I repeat, we're receiving some feed-"
"JACKSON: Hello? Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, I'm receiving feed-"
"JACKSON: Do you hear me? Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, I can hear you. I -"
"JACKSON: Sookie, just tell me if you can hear me."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, I can hear. . .I can hear you just fine!"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, this system's gonna work great."
"JACKSON: Why aren't you using the walkie-talkie?"
"SOOKIE: It's not working."
"JACKSON: Here."
"SOOKIE: Hey, you know, I had a thought."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"SOOKIE: Well, obviously, it's gonna take some time to get the inn up and running, right?"
"LORELAI: Right."
"SOOKIE: And until we do, we have absolutely no money coming in whatsoever."
"LORELAI: So it's a happy thought."
"SOOKIE: What do you think about starting a catering company?"
"LORELAI: A catering company."
"SOOKIE: Yeah. You could plan the events, decorations, themes, and I can cook."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"SOOKIE: And it wouldn't be for very long - just until the baby came."
"LORELAI: Yes, but. . ."
"JACKSON: Okay, here."
"LORELAI: Sookie, I'm not really a party planner. I've never done that."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about? You put on all those beautiful weddings at the inn. And the conventions -- the men in the hats and the buttons."
"LORELAI: Yes, but I had a staff at the inn and I had resources."
"SOOKIE: Oh, come on. It'll be so fun to work together again. Just think about it."
"LORELAI: Fine, I'll think about it."
"SOOKIE: Good."
"LORELAI: How long do I have to think about it?"
"SOOKIE: About a week."
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Helen Thompson's son, Aaron, is having a birthday party and she asked me to cater, and I suggested that you plan it. She thought it was a fabulous idea. So she offered us the job and I just took it. It's Thursday. She wanted to do it on Aaron's actual birthday and I thought that was so sweet. Helen's like that, you know?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I know."
"SOOKIE: I can call her right now and tell her no if that's what you want. I mean it, you say the word and it's off. Maybe we could just try this one just to see if you like it. Maybe."
"JACKSON: Okay, Sookie, can you hear me now? Hello?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, I can hear you."
"JACKSON: Use the monitor!"
"SOOKIE: Sorry!"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory walks into the dorm. Another student rushes past her]"
"STUDENT: Russian economics sucks."
"RORY: I will make a note."
"[Rory walks into her suite to find the common room completely redecorated]"
"RORY: Tanna? Tanna?"
"TANNA: What?"
"RORY: Where did this come from?"
"TANNA: What?"
"RORY: This - the furniture, the couch, the chairs, the rug."
"TANNA: I don't know. It must've been here when I got back."
"[Rory's cell phone rings]"
"RORY: [answers] Hello?"
"EMILY: I was going to wait until you called me, but my life isn't as long as yours. Did you sit on the couch?"
"RORY: The couch?"
"EMILY: I didn't want to get it too soft because I knew you would be studying there as well as watching television, and you would need a little bit of support."
"RORY: You did this?"
"EMILY: Of course I did it. My granddaughter's a Yalie now. She needs to live like a Yalie."
"RORY: But how? When?"
"EMILY: I snuck in yesterday when you were in classes just to measure to make sure everything would fit. Then I had to butter up your dippy freshman counselor so she'd let the movers in. Did you look in the entertainment center yet?"
"RORY: No. Oh."
"EMILY: That's a plasma TV with a VCR and a DVD player. There's also a five-CD changer and a turntable, and the whole thing is wired in 5.1 surround sound. Now I have no idea what that means, but the man who installed it said to get Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. It's supposed to be amazing."
"RORY: Grandma, this is all really sweet, but I have roommates, you know? And this might make them a little uncomfortable."
"EMILY: Uncomfortable about what?"
"RORY: Well, um, this is a common room. It is common to all of us."
"EMILY: Mmhmm."
"RORY: Four of us who live here. There are four of us who live here together. And the common room. . .it's what we all have in common."
"EMILY: Oh, just show them how to use the remote. I'm sure they'll be fine with everything."
"RORY: Grandma, I worry that by you giving me all these things, it kind of makes it my room."
"EMILY: Exactly."
"RORY: What?"
"EMILY: Never underestimate the value of the upper hand, Rory. You are in the real world now. Status matters."
"RORY: But -"
"EMILY: Your grandfather and I are very proud of you. Enjoy the furniture. We'll see you on Friday."
"RORY: Okay, see you Friday. [hangs up] My grandmother broke into our room and furnished it."
"TANNA: Did she put that fireplace in, too?"
"RORY: No, Tanna, the fireplace was always. . . hey, why don't we take a little tour of the place, okay?"
"TANNA: Great."
"RORY: Yeah."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai enters the house carrying some takeout. She goes into the kitchen, grabs a plate and a napkin, then heads to the living room. She grabs the cordless phone, and as she sits down on the couch, it rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] They burnt my fries, forgot to give me an extra side of barbecue sauce, the jeep is making that crunchy sound again, and I have to spend my evening making elf ears for Aaron Thompson's Lord of the Rings party."
"RORY: Grandma broke into my dorm and redid the entire common room in $25,000 worth of furniture and stereo equipment."
"LORELAI: You win."
"RORY: It's unbelievable. You should see this place. I feel like I'm at Uday's house."
"LORELAI: Okay, tell me the whole story."
"RORY: I came home and all the normal furniture was gone and all this stuff was in here."
"LORELAI: What did your roommates say?"
"RORY: Tanna still doesn't know she's at Yale, Paris saw it and said nothing."
"LORELAI: Oh, so that's coming."
"RORY: Janet's out jogging so I don't know what she thinks, but I have to hope she's pleased 'cause that girl's in shape and can kick my butt."
"LORELAI: Well, just make sure there's something she likes on the TV when she gets home. Something soothing to runners - maybe something that goes in a circle over and over."
"RORY: This is bad. This is a total invasion of privacy."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: She didn't even ask. She got rid of everything that was in here. What if some of that furniture belonged to someone and they wanted it? I don't know what she was thinking."
"LORELAI: She was thinking, ""Rory's life - mine. Must cover with chenille."""
"RORY: I can't believe she did this."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, you can."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Well, Rory, come on, it's my mother. It's Emily Gilmore. This is what she does. You've seen her pull stunts like this on me for years."
"RORY: Yeah, but that was you."
"LORELAI: I told you when you borrowed that money from her that this is what you were getting into."
"RORY: I can't believe you're gloating."
"LORELAI: I'm not gloating. I'm just saying, when you sleep with dogs, you wake up with an entertainment center."
"RORY: Fine, so what do I do?"
"LORELAI: Well, you could come out and say, ""Grandma, this furniture is very nice. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a dorm room, and I cannot guarantee that the other people will love it as much as I do, and I worry about expensive equipment getting stolen, and it's just maybe too much right now."""
"RORY: That sounds good."
"LORELAI: Okay. And then my mother will say, ""Rory, your grandfather and I are paying for you to go to Yale. We are enabling you to have this rarefied education, and you're being ungrateful and small-minded, and I resent it. I am hurt on a level you will not be able to understand until you yourself have a daughter or a granddaughter who will cut your heart out the way you've just cut mine out, and I hope that small veneer of independence that you've extracted from this incident is worth the complete and total alienation of the grandparents who have done nothing but love you and thought of you only."""
"RORY: Or I could keep the furniture."
"LORELAI: Yes, you could."
"RORY: This is great."
"LORELAI: Hon, seriously, if you feel strongly, say something. I just want you to be prepared, that's all."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: And take heart in knowing that when it comes to controlling a person, my mother targeted my soul, my independence, and my entire future, and at least with you, she threw in an ottoman."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Richard arrives home and walks to the living room where Emily is looking through swatches of fabric]"
"RICHARD: Emily? I'm home."
"EMILY: I keep wanting to give this room a little spruce, but for the life of me, every one of these fabrics gives me a headache. What do you think of this one?"
"RICHARD: Hm? It's fine."
"EMILY: Well, that's just the sort of enthusiasm I was looking for."
"RICHARD: Emily, you have excellent taste. I'm sure whichever one you pick will look lovely."
"EMILY: Do you need some ice?"
"RICHARD: Uh, no. A taller glass."
"EMILY: You sound tired."
"RICHARD: It's been a very long day."
"EMILY: You know, some men retire."
"RICHARD: Yes, and some men tattoo their mother's names on their biceps."
"EMILY: I don't think the two are necessarily linked."
"RICHARD: I'm fine, Emily. I just need a drink and a nice meal, and I'll be good as new."
"EMILY: You got a call from Jason Stiles today."
"RICHARD: Digger Stiles? What did he want?"
"EMILY: To talk to you."
"RICHARD: I have nothing to say to him."
"EMILY: He might have something interesting to tell you."
"RICHARD: What - that the turncoat company I used to work for is cutting my pension? That the stock they gave me when they unceremoniously forced me out has been rescinded?"
"EMILY: Yes. That, or hello."
"RICHARD: He's probably been sent to do his father's dirty work. It's not enough to fire me, they have to continue to harass me now that I'm gone."
"EMILY: I thought you always liked Digger."
"RICHARD: Yes, I liked Digger when he was fetching my coffee. I liked Digger when he was refilling my stapler. But I do not like Digger now that he is his father's heir apparent and sent to annoy me. And I certainly don't understand your need to defend him."
"EMILY: I'm not defending him. If you don't want to return the boy's call, don't return his call."
"RICHARD: Thank you."
"EMILY: I invited him over tomorrow anyway. You can find out what he wants then."
"RICHARD: You did what?"
"EMILY: Well, he was absolutely insistent that he talk to you."
"RICHARD: Why would you do that?"
"EMILY: It was the polite thing to do. If you don't want him to come over, I have his number. You may call him and disinvite him. It's up to you."
"RICHARD: Fine, he can come over, but he is not staying for a drink. He can come in and deliver his message and then leave."
"EMILY: Whatever you say."
"RICHARD: That's it - no drink, no handshake, nothing."
"EMILY: I'll even hide the liquor bottles so he doesn't get any bright ideas."
"RICHARD: It's extremely comforting to have such a supportive wife in times like these."
"EMILY: I'm so glad."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is on the couch in the common room when Paris walks in]"
"PARIS: Did you hear?"
"RORY: Hear what?"
"PARIS: The first party of the year is going to be on our floor."
"RORY: Oh yeah?"
"PARIS: Technically, it's to celebrate the first week of classes, but I'm anticipating the themes quickly degenerating to ""Hey, walking works -- let's drink."" The important thing is that this party, the first party, is going to be on our floor. Our floor."
"RORY: Yes, our floor."
"PARIS: Anyhow, the way it works is that anyone who wants to be apart of the party will just leave their door open so people can just wander in and out. So what do you think?"
"RORY: About what?"
"PARIS: Leaving our door open. It's the perfect opportunity to solidify our social standing at Yale. It'll virtually guarantee invitations to every other party thrown this year, and we'll get our faces in people's heads."
"RORY: I don't know."
"PARIS: What, what don't you know? I've explained the entire thing to you."
"RORY: Well, I'm not sure I want to leave our door open to a bunch of strangers."
"PARIS: Well, they won't be strangers once they come in and say howdy."
"RORY: Yeah, but I'm not sure how I'm gonna feel that night. I might be tired."
"PARIS: For God's sakes, Grandpa, you're eighteen. Sleep when you're dead."
"RORY: Look, we can still go to the party. We can meet people, you can solidify your social status, get your face in people's heads, and I can bail when I feel like it."
"PARIS: Going isn't the same. Going is passive. Opening your door, you are giving the party. You are responsible for the fun. People owe you. Don't you want people to owe you?"
"RORY: I'm good, actually."
"PARIS: Oh, sure, you're good. You're fine. After all, you have all this fancy furniture and a big TV to lord over people. It's the rest of us who are screwed - the ones whose grandparents hadn't thought to provide suck-up furniture."
"RORY: This is not suck-up furniture."
"PARIS: You're being selfish. You don't care about anybody but yourself."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: No. I hate college!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the kitchen table]"
"LORELAI: Okay, we've got costumes, we're got cutouts, we've got rings, ladies and gentlemen. We've got fairy necklaces, we've got tree heads. I'm picking up table decorations tomorrow. Oh, do you need me to order a Lord of the Rings cake?"
"SOOKIE: The cake is under control."
"LORELAI: Okay, cake's off my list. So you've got the menu going, right?"
"SOOKIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Just festive kiddie food. You know, like, uh, bagel dogs, tater tots, mini pizzas, mac and cheese. Oh, you know what would be great? Those colored popcorn balls. Rory used to go mental over those things."
"SOOKIE: Hey, how many adults are gonna be there?"
"LORELAI: Probably about ten."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"[Lane walks in the back door]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"LANE: Hey. Okay, so I've scoured the entire store and here's what we got."
"LORELAI: Hit me."
"LANE: Horn of Gondor, Legolas' bow, and a cape."
"LORELAI: Cape for who?"
"LANE: There's 4,000 people in that movie who wear capes - you can't pick one?"
"LORELAI: Wow, you're crabby."
"LANE: Well, I wore a bracelet to school today. My parents were called. There was a special service in chapel, and I've been ordered to a soul-searching seminar next week. I'll be sitting between the nail-polish-wearing girl and the spicy condiment user."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"LANE: That's okay."
"LORELAI: Leave the horn, the bow, and the bill."
"LANE: Right."
"[the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello?"
"PARIS: I need to talk to you about Rory."
"LORELAI: Paris?"
"PARIS: She's not adjusting well. I'm actually concerned about her."
"LORELAI: Well, that's very -"
"PARIS: The socialization process in college is vitally important. The connections we make here can last a lifetime. They can alter the course of our future. That's how important they are."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"PARIS: Now I'm sure it's tempting to emotionally stunt your daughter so she'll move back home and take care of you in your old age, but I thought you wanted better for her."
"LORELAI: Hey, Paris, did something happen between you and Rory?"
"PARIS: She won't open the door for the party."
"LORELAI: The -"
"PARIS: There's a party on our floor, and if you open your door, you get to be apart of it, but she won't open the door because she's busy being Heidi's grandfather, and if you were a real mother --"
"RORY: Paris, you called my mother?"
"PARIS: Well, you wouldn't listen to me."
"RORY: Give me that phone! Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hi, honey. How's school?"
"RORY: I'm rooming with a Stephen King novel."
"LORELAI: What's she talking about?"
"RORY: Oh, just some ridiculous party. I don't want to let a million strangers traipse through my room, so she's having a meltdown. I'm sorry she bothered you."
"LORELAI: That's okay."
"RORY: I'm gonna k*ll her."
"LORELAI: Remember, you cut off one head, she'll just grow another. So tell me about the party."
"RORY: It's nothing, it's just a ""first week of class"" kind of thing."
"LORELAI: Are you going?"
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: You know, it might not be such a bad idea to get to know the people in your building, see who's gonna be the ones to have the emergency Pop Tarts on hand."
"RORY: I'll get to know them."
"LORELAI: A party might be kind of a fun way to do it."
"RORY: I'm sorry, are you telling me to let Paris open the door to the world?"
"LORELAI: I'm not telling you anything. I just want to make sure that at the end of four years, you've not only read every book in the Yale library, you've also had some fun."
"RORY: I will have fun."
"LORELAI: But I can see you the night of the party holing up in your room with a book for the entire evening."
"RORY: You know when I do that, I'm not hiding. I enjoy it. And I'm making friends - you saw me make friends."
"LORELAI: I know, but I'm not just talking about making friends. I'm talking about experiencing things. Parties, football games, protests, barn burnings."
"RORY: Very big amongst the kids these days."
"LORELAI: Those are all experiences. Maybe dumb experiences, but you never know when you're accidentally gonna stumble across something that could be. . .something."
"RORY: Fine, I'll open the door."
"PARIS: Yes!"
"RORY: This isn't for you!"
"PARIS: Like I care about the reason."
"LORELAI: You might have fun."
"RORY: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"LORELAI: Call me later."
"RORY: If I don't, I'm sure Paris will."
"PARIS: Tell her thanks for me."
"RORY: I will not!"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is in the common room when Tanna walks in wearing Rory's old Chilton uniform]"
"TANNA: What do you think?"
"RORY: What is that?"
"TANNA: Well, you said I could borrow something to wear to the party."
"RORY: Yeah, I did, but that's my Chilton uniform. My mom probably threw it in for a joke. It's my high-school uniform. I wore it every day to. . .you know, there's a tie in there that goes with it."
"PARIS: Okay, I've scoped out the other open rooms and no one seems to have copped a clear identity yet, which leaves the field wide open. So what do you think we should be? We've got a lot of seating, so we could be the make-out room. Or we could crank the stereo up and push the furniture aside and be the dance room. Or we could throw down some towels and be the keg room."
"RORY: I don't want an identity. You already made me open the door. I opened the door. We're the open-door room. That's it."
"PARIS: How about some low lighting and some candles? We could be the meaningful-conversation room."
"RORY: No themes."
"PARIS: But -"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: No one knows me here, Rory. Do you understand what that means? It means I can start all over. I can wipe out the last eighteen years and introduce people to the new Paris Geller, the fun Paris Geller. I just want everything to be different this year, that's all."
"RORY: One candle."
"PARIS: Thank you, thank you."
"CUT TO THE BIRTHDAY PARTY"
"[Lorelai is talking to a little boy]"
"LORELAI: No, seriously, give me the ring."
"ROGER: No way."
"LORELAI: Five bucks."
"ROGER: No."
"LORELAI: Just let me hold it."
"ROGER: Forget it."
"LORELAI: Come on, I promise I'll give it right back, my precious. I mean, Roger."
"ROGER: You're crazy."
"LORELAI: What? You're the one with the pointy ears, my friend."
"[A woman walks two more boys over to Lorelai]"
"HELEN: Here we go. I'd like you to meet Redmond and Riley James."
"LORELAI: Redmond, Riley, nice to meet you. I'm Julie, your cruise director. I'm here to help you with your costumes."
"REDMOND: I want to be Legolas."
"RILEY: I want to be Gimli."
"REDMOND: I want to be Gimli, too."
"LORELAI: Okay, two Gimlis coming up."
"BOY: Lorelai, my hood is loose!"
"REDMOND: Her name is Julie, stupid."
"BOY: No, it's not, retard!"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, hey."
"RILEY: She just told us her name was Julie. She's our cruise director."
"BOY: What's a cruise director?"
"REDMOND: I don't know, but you fart with your face."
"LORELAI: Hey, love, guys. Love, okay? Lord of the Rings is all about the love."
"BOY: Nuh uh, it's about the destruction of all mankind."
"LORELAI: And who doesn't love that? You're fixed. Go play - lovingly."
"HELEN: Lorelai, some of the kids are asking for swords. Did you bring swords?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I didn't."
"HELEN: Oh, thank God. Oh, the Raymonds - I forgot we made up. Will you excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"[A little girl walks up to her]"
"GIRL: Riley said only boy hobbits can travel to Mount Doom. Is that true?"
"LORELAI: In the movie, only boy hobbits travel to Mount Doom, but that's only because the girls went to do something even more dangerous."
"GIRL: What?"
"LORELAI: Have you ever heard of a Brazilian bikini wax?"
"SOOKIE: [calls from across the yard] Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Oh, great, you're here."
"GIRL: So girls go on adventures, too?"
"LORELAI: And they go in heels."
"GIRL: Good."
"SOOKIE: Are Rawley and Cheech here?"
"LORELAI: Yup, they've been chopping away for an hour."
"SOOKIE: Perfect. Wow, there is a full house, isn't there? You have enough costumes?"
"LORELAI: We're good - the screen's up, the tables are set, and four kids are crying, so we're right on schedule."
"SOOKIE: Well, I better get in the kitchen."
"LORELAI: All right, because it's coming up on elevenses and the hobbits are hungry, right?"
"KIDS: Right!"
"SOOKIE: I'm going, I'm going."
"MAN: Hey, who wants a sword?"
"KIDS: Me!"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily opens the front door]"
"EMILY: Well, Jason Stiles, look at you."
"JASON: Look at me - look at you. I've just got a trainer. You have cheated God."
"EMILY: You've been here one minute and you're already starting with the flattery."
"JASON: I apologize. It is lovely to see you, Emily."
"EMILY: It's lovely to see you also."
"JASON: So, did you sell your soul to the devil or. . ."
"EMILY: How's your mother?"
"JASON: She is exactly the same."
"EMILY: And her horses?"
"JASON: Have a better life than I do."
"EMILY: Well, Richard is in his study."
"JASON: I would expect no less."
"[they walk to the study and knock on the door]"
"RICHARD: Come in."
"[they walk in]"
"EMILY: Richard, there's someone here to see you."
"JASON: Hello, Richard. I appreciate you taking the time to do this."
"EMILY: Well, I'll leave you two alone. Jason, be sure and say goodbye before you leave."
"JASON: I'll do that."
"[Emily leaves]"
"JASON: So, how have you been?"
"RICHARD: Fine."
"JASON: May I sit?"
"RICHARD: Your choice."
"JASON: I hear your business is going well."
"RICHARD: You hear correctly."
"JASON: No reason for it not to be going well. You were always the best."
"RICHARD: Is that what you came here to tell me, how competent I was at my job?"
"JASON: Nope, I came here to make you a proposition."
"RICHARD: Go ahead and make it."
"JASON: I want to be your partner."
"RICHARD: Excuse me?"
"JASON: I want to join forces with you. You know, put a desk in your office, get a copy of the key, maybe snag some of that fancy stationery to write on."
"RICHARD: You're not serious."
"JASON: I'm prepared to buy my way in. I am also prepared to bring all of my current clients, and that should be appealing to you, even if sharing an office and parting with some stationery is not. Think about it. I could make your company an instant contender, with my youth and my clients and your reputation and respectability. It's a pretty interesting package, don't you think?"
"RICHARD: You want to become my partner."
"JASON: Yes."
"RICHARD: You want to pay me and bring a whole slew of high-paying clients with you."
"JASON: You keep leaving out the stationery."
"RICHARD: Thank you for coming, Jason."
"JASON: Is something wrong?"
"RICHARD: Yes, something's wrong. I don't appreciate you wasting my time."
"JASON: I didn't know that I was."
"RICHARD: Am I such a joke to you that you feel you can come in here. . ."
"JASON: You're no joke."
"RICHARD: . . .and take my time away from important things?"
"JASON: I assure you you are no joke. You were the best my father's company ever had."
"RICHARD: You're damn right I was the best that company had, and now I am the best competition they will ever have."
"JASON: Not yet. But with me, you could be."
"RICHARD: Why? Why would you think I'd believe you were serious about this?"
"JASON: When was the last time I stuck a whoopee cushion on your chair, Richard?"
"RICHARD: Your father started that company. He made that company."
"JASON: With you."
"RICHARD: You've been working there since you were a kid. All the way through Harvard, you worked there. You've been groomed to take that company over, and now you're telling me you want to leave?"
"JASON: Yes."
"RICHARD: Why?"
"JASON: Because I want to do something on my own. I want to work someplace that hasn't known me since I was six. I'd like to get through an entire day without being called Digger. And I really, really want to piss off my dad."
"RICHARD: You what?"
"JASON: Can you imagine his face? No, really, take a moment. Picture it. I walk into his office, he's sitting in his enormous red-leather chair, and I say, ""Dad, I am leaving. I am taking all of my high-paying clients with me, and I am getting into business with Richard Gilmore, the man you forced out to make room for me."" Can you see that face?"
"RICHARD: I can see it."
"JASON: It's a pretty good face, isn't it?"
"RICHARD: It is rather satisfying."
"JASON: So, what do you say?"
"RICHARD: You hate your father that much?"
"JASON: I don't hate him. I just don't want to be him."
"RICHARD: Jason, would you care to join me for a drink?"
"JASON: Gladly."
"[As they exit the study, Jason's pager goes off]"
"RICHARD: Emily, Jason's going to join us for a drink."
"EMILY: He is? Well, how nice."
"JASON: Richard, would you mind if I borrowed your phone?"
"RICHARD: Not at all. You can use the one in my study."
"JASON: Thank you. I'll be right out."
"[Jason walks back into the study. Emily and Richard walk to the living room]"
"EMILY: So, I see your meeting went well."
"RICHARD: It was actually very interesting."
"EMILY: Really?"
"RICHARD: He wants to be my business partner."
"EMILY: What? But what about his father and his company?"
"RICHARD: He wants to leave. He wants to work with the best."
"EMILY: Well, good for Digger."
"RICHARD: Well, I always did like that boy."
"EMILY: So what did you say?"
"RICHARD: Well, I told him I would have to think about it. I mean, it's not as if I need anyone working with me. Things are going very well. I'm building a very solid client base."
"EMILY: It would be nice for you not to have to work so hard."
"RICHARD: I don't mind hard work, Emily."
"EMILY: I know you don't mind it. I just said that it would be nice if you didn't have to do it."
"RICHARD: Well. . ."
"EMILY: Jason's a very nice boy."
"RICHARD: Yes, he is. He is a very nice boy."

"CUT TO THE BIRTHDAY PARTY"
"[Sookie is setting up in the dining room.]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"SOOKIE: I'm getting the tables ready."
"LORELAI: They were ready."
"SOOKIE: No, ready for the food."
"LORELAI: They were ready for the food."
"SOOKIE: No, they weren't."
"LORELAI: Yes, they were. I set them myself."
"SOOKIE: But where were the tablecloths?"
"LORELAI: Right here. There."
"SOOKIE: They're paper."
"LORELAI: Yes, they are."
"SOOKIE: And there's monsters on them."
"LORELAI: No, they're Lord of the Rings characters, which is rather appropriate since this is a Lord of the Rings party."
"SOOKIE: So this is the table?"
"LORELAI: Yup."
"SOOKIE: And the paper cups and plates. . ."
"LORELAI: All there on purpose."
"SOOKIE: I thought you just put them out for the kids to see."
"LORELAI: And use."
"SOOKIE: But the chafing dish looks so much better on the white tablecloth."
"LORELAI: Um, you shouldn't have a chafing dish out here."
"SOOKIE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because a chafing dish has a candle, and a candle has a flame, and a kid could stick his finger in there and get hurt."
"SOOKIE: Isn't that how they learn?"
"LORELAI: Let's heat things up in the kitchen."
"SOOKIE: Fine."
"LORELAI: You made brie."
"SOOKIE: Oh. With lavender honey and, uh, bourbon-sugared pecans. I thought it would go nicely with the crudités platter."
"LORELAI: Please tell me you made food for the kids."
"SOOKIE: I did make food for the kids."
"LORELAI: These kids - not the Romanov kids."
"SOOKIE: I just put this out in case anyone over the age of ten gets hungry. There are parents here, too, you know."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: Parents whose responsibility it would be to keep their kid from hitting another kid or putting their fingers under a chafing dish."
"LORELAI: Sookie. . ."
"SOOKIE: Fine."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Paris walks through the party]"
"PARIS: Hey, having a good time? I'm Paris Geller, suite five. It's open. It's got a candle - perfect for some deep conversation. Uh, prepare two to five subjects to discuss so that the conversation doesn't lag and totally ruin the vibe. Party on. [walks over to Rory] So, I did a survey of all the rooms and, by far, ours is the best."
"RORY: Great."
"PARIS: Three is way too cluttered. Four has developed a weird smell."
"RORY: Uh huh"
"PARIS: Two was a contender for awhile until I started telling everyone that the girl who lives there was waitlisted. I'm gonna get out there and mingle. This is a great party. [walks away]"
"[Rory goes into her bedroom and tries to read a book, then goes back out to the party]"
"MADELINE: Rory!"
"RORY: Oh, my God! Madeline, Louise, what are you doing here?"
"LOUISE: Party, baby."
"RORY: I thought you were supposed to be at Mills."
"MADELINE: Where?"
"RORY: Mills?"
"MADELINE: Where?"
"RORY: No more Mills?"
"MADELINE: Mills went bye-bye before I unpacked my shoes."
"LOUISE: She's been hanging out at Tulane with me."
"MADELINE: I love New Orleans. I am so southern."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"LOUISE: We went online and found out where all the first week of class parties were, and we're making the rounds."
"MADELINE: We hit Harvard next."
"LOUISE: That's where my boyfriend goes."
"RORY: Oh, you're dating a Harvard man?"
"MADELINE: He's gonna be a writer."
"LOUISE: Well, he hopes. Right now, he's totally freaked that The Simpsons are going to be off the air by the time he graduates."
"RORY: Well, it's good to see you guys. Paris is around here somewhere."
"MADELINE: I hope she's in back of that guy over there because that's where I'm heading."
"LOUISE: We'll be back."
"RORY: Good luck."
"[Madeline and Louise walk away. Two girls walk up to Rory]"
"MICKEY: Rory Gilmore?"
"KICK: Are you Rory Gilmore?"
"RORY: Yes, I'm Rory Gilmore."
"KICK: Rory. . .what can we do with that?"
"MICKEY: Ro-ro?"
"KICK: Ry-ror?"
"MICKEY: Her last name might help."
"KICK: Gilmore."
"MICKEY: Ro-gil? Gil-roy?"
"RORY: Excuse, me, what are you doing?"
"KICK: Giving you a nick."
"MICKEY: A nickname."
"RORY: Do I know you?"
"KICK: We get so ahead of ourselves. We're like time travelers. I'm Kick."
"MICKEY: I'm Mickey. Your grandmother Emily told us to look you up."
"RORY: My grandmother?"
"KICK: She's tight with our mom, D.A.R. darling. When she heard we were going to Yale, she laid down the law."
"MICKEY: To look you up and make sure you fell in with the right crowd."
"KICK: Which would be us."
"MICKEY: But we never settled on a nickname."
"KICK: I think we're still trying the last-first combo."
"RORY: Listen, I really appreciate you guys seeking me out, and it was really nice meeting you, but I actually have to go find my roommate."
"KICK: Do you have a middle name?"
"MICKEY: Yes, that might help."
"KICK: When's your birthday?"
"MICKEY: Oh, astrological nickname. Very in. very, very in."
"KICK: Seating."
"MICKEY: Ooh, great fabric."
"KICK: This is the furniture Emily bought."
"MICKEY: That's right. That woman does have taste."
"KICK: I wish she'd talk to Mom."
"MICKEY: Yeah, 'cause then we wouldn't have to."
"KICK: Did Mom tell you about Christmas?"
"MICKEY: Yes. Hawaii."
"KICK: Can't even imagine what's going through her mind."
"MICKEY: Walt Disney could not imagine what was going through her mind."
"CUT TO LATER AT THE YALE PARTY"
"GUY: You want the guy that pumps your gas voting?"
"GIRL: That is what America is about."
"GUY: What ignorance!"
"GIRL: You're the ignorant one."
"KICK: I had a terrible dream the other night that everything they say about sunscreen is true."
"MICKEY: I have had that dream."
"PARIS: I don't think I'm having fun."
"RORY: Well, the party's not over yet."
"PARIS: I know. What's with the Gabor sisters?"
"RORY: Friends from my grandmother."
"PARIS: Great. Everybody has a group but me."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"PARIS: Janet's a runner, so she'll automatically be in the jock group. Tanna's a freak, so she'll be in the John Nash group. You've got your grandmother's obligation friends, and I'm stuck over there listening to a bad talk-radio session. This sucks."
"RORY: Well, we could just kick everyone out and just go to bed."
"PARIS: No. I'll just have to try a little harder. I'm determined. Things are going to be different this year."
"GUY: [to Paris] Hey. pierce my ear."
"PARIS: Okay, everybody out, now! This room is closed. Take your gross beer and your inane conversations somewhere else. Move!"
"MICKEY: What's going on?"
"RORY: I don't know. Looks like my roommate's kicking everybody out. Oh sh**t."
"PARIS: Hey, Bim and Bim, up. Let's move, now."
"KICK: Hey!"
"RORY: Sorry. She's my roommate. What can I do? Call me."
"CUT TO THE BIRTHDAY PARTY"
"[The kids are gathered around the TV watching Lord of the Rings.]"
"HELEN: Lorelai, some of the kids are starting to get hungry. I think we should have the food ready to go the minute the movie's over."
"LORELAI: I agree. I'll get right on that. [she walks to the dining room] Oh, hey. Um, Helen wants us to put the food on."
"SOOKIE: Oh, one step ahead of you."
"LORELAI: Good, good. So, uh, what do we have here?"
"SOOKIE: A little lemon-garlic aioli for the blanched veggies."
"LORELAI: Oh, great."
"SOOKIE: You think I should put the assorted charcuteries on this table or this one?"
"LORELAI: It depends. Which one is the kids' table?"
"SOOKIE: There are no designated tables. I'm mixing and matching here."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Oh, perfect. Right here. Well, hello, gorgeous. What's your name?"
"LORELAI: Oh, boy. Wow."
"[a little girl walks into the dining room]"
"GIRL: I'm hungry."
"SOOKIE: Would you like some gravlax?"
"GIRL: Some what?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, where's the kids' food?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, you need to relax. I haven't put the kids' food out yet because you wouldn't let me use the chafing dishes and I didn't want the food to get cold."
"[the little girl tastes a carrot, then puts it back on the tray of food]"
"SOOKIE: What did you just do?"
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: You just stuck that carrot in your mouth and then put it back on the platter. Why would you do that?"
"GIRL: It tastes like diapers."
"SOOKIE: It does not taste like diapers."
"LORELAI: Honey, why don't you go sit down. I'll call you when dinner's ready."
"SOOKIE: You take it back!"
"LORELAI: Okay, come on."
"[Lorelai pulls Sookie into the kitchen]"
"SOOKIE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Where is it?"
"SOOKIE: Where is what?"
"LORELAI: The food that doesn't taste like diapers."
"SOOKIE: You mean the kids' food?"
"LORELAI: Yes, the kids' food. Did you make any?"
"SOOKIE: I'm not stupid."
"LORELAI: I never said you were stupid."
"SOOKIE: You know, I booked this gig. I'm the one who came to you and said, ""Hey, you want to cater a kids' party with me?"" [she pulls a dish out of the oven] Here. Here is the children's food for the children's birthday party, okay?"
"LORELAI: What is that?"
"SOOKIE: It's macaroni and cheese."
"LORELAI: It's green. Why is it green?"
"SOOKIE: Because I made it with a jalapeno-chipotle cream sauce."
"LORELAI: Kids aren't gonna eat this."
"SOOKIE: When they try it -"
"LORELAI: They won't even try it."
"SOOKIE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because it's green."
"SOOKIE: You haven't even offered it to them yet. They may surprise you."
"LORELAI: Where is the rest of it?"
"SOOKIE: The rest of what?"
"LORELAI: The rest of the kid food."
"SOOKIE: This is it."
"LORELAI: Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: They're small! How much can they eat?"
"LORELAI: We talked about this. I mentioned hot dogs and pizza puffs and chips. I told you to make popcorn balls. Where the hell are the popcorn balls?"
"SOOKIE: You were serious about that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, my God! Is that the cake?"
"SOOKIE: Of course it's the cake. You think I would go to a birthday party without a cake?"
"LORELAI: What kind of cake is it, Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Chocolate. With a rum-raisin, tropical-fruit ganache."
"LORELAI: Okay, um, Cheech? Uh, here. Go to, um, Doose's, okay, and get, like, five boxes of frozen mini pizzas and five boxes of those pigs in a blanket and all the chips you can find. And then go to Weston's, get a couple dozen cupcakes, and have Mamie give you a couple of big bags of jimmies - like chocolate, rainbow, whatever."
"SOOKIE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: We'll have them decorate their own cupcakes. They'll love it. Okay, go."
"SOOKIE: We're going to serve them cupcakes?"
"LORELAI: Maybe they have something to tide them over for a little while."
"SOOKIE: Hey, hey, I'm talking here."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know. Just relax. It's gonna be fine."
"SOOKIE: I know it's gonna be fine because I've been cooking all week long. I made four different cakes before choosing that particular one. So, yeah, I know it's gonna be fine."
"LORELAI: But the kids won't eat that."
"SOOKIE: You know what, I'm getting a little tired of you telling me what the kids won't eat. You are supposed to plan the party, and I'm supposed to do the cooking. That's the arrangement."
"LORELAI: Yes, but you have to think about the client, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: I am thinking about the client. That cake is incredible."
"LORELAI: Not if you're an 8-year-old."
"SOOKIE: How do you know?"
"LORELAI: Because I had an 8-year-old, and she hung out with other 8-year-olds, and my taste right now is not that different from an 8-year-old."
"SOOKIE: Okay, you can't just walk in and take over. That's not the arrangement. You're not in charge here. We're partners."
"LORELAI: I know that."
"SOOKIE: I'm a great chef. A great chef does not have the client decorate his own cupcakes."
"[a little girl walks in]"
"GIRL: Can I have a juice box?"
"SOOKIE: Hey, we're talking!"
"[the girl's face scrunches up like she's about to cry]"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. . . [she gets a juice box from the fridge]"
"SOOKIE: What's the matter with her? Is she sick? Why is her mouth open? Lorelai, look at her face."
"LORELAI: [to the girl] Hi, honey. There's your juice. It's grape. Do you like grape? Me, too! It makes your tongue all purple. Now take your juice and go watch the rest of the movie, all right? You look very nice in your costume. [the girl leaves] Okay, Sookie, I didn't mean to just take over like that. I felt a crisis coming on so I snapped into problem-solving mode, and I didn't think."
"SOOKIE: I can't do this."
"LORELAI: Yes, you can. We just need to be clearer on the menu next time."
"SOOKIE: No, not this. [points to her stomach] This."
"LORELAI: Isn't it a little late?"
"SOOKIE: You saw me with that little girl. I mean, and her face - I made that face."
"LORELAI: You were upset."
"SOOKIE: This is not right. This is all wrong. I don't. . .I don't want to be pregnant anymore!"
"LORELAI: What are you gonna do, walk it off? Sookie, Sookie. . .hey, hey. . .where are you going?"
"SOOKIE: A child is not a duvet cover. You can't just take it back if it doesn't like you."
"LORELAI: Luckily, duvet covers notoriously like whoever they go home with. They're like golden retrievers."
"SOOKIE: You know what happens when kids don't like you? They tie you to a chair. They brain you with a bat. They set fire to the house and blame it on the neighbors."
"LORELAI: Wow, now you can't have kids or live next door to them."
"SOOKIE: I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know how to feed them, I cover up their party cloths, and I set their fingers on fire."
"LORELAI: Just this once."
"SOOKIE: I make them eat jalapeno-chipotle cream sauce. I'm Mommie Dearest."
"LORELAI: Okay, back in the kitchen."
"SOOKIE: No, I can't go back. I've got hummus in there."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"SOOKIE: God knows what I'll do with it!"
"LORELAI: Oh. Uh, hey, Rawley, could you just go make sure the kids have enough soda? [to Sookie] You just have to calm down."
"SOOKIE: I can't have it."
"LORELAI: Yes, you can."
"SOOKIE: No, I can't. I'm gonna fail. Get it out, get it out, get it out!"
"LORELAI: Stop. Breathe. Drink. Everything's gonna be fine."
"SOOKIE: Kids don't like me, and I'm not so sure I like them."
"LORELAI: You'll like your kid."
"SOOKIE: You know at family gatherings when everyone goes into the living room, gathers around, watches the kids? I read. Jackson's sister has a little girl, six years old. She likes to get up in front of the family after dinner and sing Mariah Carey songs. I heckle. I have no desire to play with them. Easter egg hunts bore me. I have never borrowed the neighbor's kid to look after for the afternoon."
"LORELAI: Good. That's called kidnapping."
"SOOKIE: ""Come on, Jackson, let's have a baby. I wanna be a mommy."" I'm pathetic."
"LORELAI: You're not pathetic."
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna be a bad mother. I should not be a parent."
"LORELAI: Sookie, look at me. There are many people in this world who should not have been parents. Mr. and Mrs. h*tler, for example. The bin Ladens could have just watched TV that night. Richard and Emily might have taken a pass at procreating. But you. . .no way. You're gonna be a great parent."
"SOOKIE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: How do you know?"
"LORELAI: Because I know you, and I watched you with Rory when she was growing up."
"SOOKIE: Well, who could not like Rory?"
"LORELAI: You're gonna be amazing. That little boy of yours is very lucky."
"SOOKIE: Okay. I guess it's gonna be okay."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: Okay. Okay. I'm really, really okay."
"LORELAI: Yeah, okay."
"[Sookie goes into the dining room, then walks right back into the kitchen]"
"SOOKIE: Someone threw up on the table."
"LORELAI: Oh, God."
"SOOKIE: I'm okay. I'm just gonna go over there and be. . .okay."
"LORELAI: Good idea."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory wakes up in the middle of the night. She hears a noise out in the hallway and walks out of her suite. A naked guy is sleeping on the floor. She wakes him up]"
"MARTY: Hi."
"RORY: Hi."
"MARTY: I'm on the floor."
"RORY: You were sleeping."
"MARTY: I have no clothes on."
"RORY: No, you don't."
"MARTY: I'm on the floor, I have no clothes on, and you're a girl, so I must be. . ."
"RORY: On the wrong floor."
"MARTY: Oh, boy."
"RORY: Where's your room?"
"MARTY: I think up. Are we on the first floor?"
"RORY: Yes."
"MARTY: Then up. Any idea how long I've been here?"
"RORY: No."
"MARTY: So you have no idea how many people have walked by while I've. . ."
"RORY: Sorry."
"MARTY: Great. Now for the rest of my time at Yale, I'm gonna be ""the naked guy."""
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"MARTY: And you know what's really great? Tomorrow, when the ""naked guy"" nickname starts spreading around campus like wildfire, I'm gonna be in my third hour of throwing up."
"RORY: Well, it's been really quiet out here for a while now, so there's a chance that no one but me has actually seen you yet."
"MARTY: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: I promise I won't say anything. And if there's a chance that you could refrain from, you know, being naked again in the wrong hallway at the next party, then there's a chance you might get a completely different nickname, like ""the never-naked guy."""
"MARTY: You're a very kind person. [he starts to stand up]"
"RORY: Wait. Hold on. Um, you can borrow this. [she hands him her robe]"
"MARTY: Thanks."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"MARTY: Hey, weren't you in my Japanese Fiction class today?"
"RORY: Yeah, that's right."
"MARTY: I thought so. Hi, I'm, uh. . .Marty."
"RORY: Um. . .Rory."
"MARTY: I won't remember that tomorrow."
"RORY: That's perfectly understandable."
"MARTY: So I should probably try and find my room. And my pants, 'cause that's where I kept my keys."
"RORY: So pants first."
"MARTY: Right, pants first."
"RORY: Night."
"MARTY: Yup. I'm officially stupider than my brother. I never thought that would happen."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Rory is waiting out front by her car when Lorelai pulls up]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: I decided I'm going to do it."
"LORELAI: To do what?"
"RORY: I'm going to go in there and I'm going to tell Grandma that she's going to butt out of my life."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm. Can I. . . [she sniffs Rory's travel mug]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Just checking. So you have soberly decided to confront my mother?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Are you sure you want to do this?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: All right, then I support you one hundred percent."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Just make sure you wait for the right moment."
"RORY: Oh, the right moment is now. The right moment arrived in a big pink hat full of feathers screaming, ""Notice me because I am here!"""
"LORELAI: Oh, well, if it was wearing a hat. . ."
"[they ring the doorbell. Emily answers the door]"
"EMILY: There they are."
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom."
"EMILY: Come in. I tell you, this day has been an absolute circus. I misplaced every single thing I needed - my grocery list, my ticket for the shoe repair. It was a nightmare. What will you girls have?"
"LORELAI: Wait for the moment, wait for the moment."
"RORY: Grandma, I have to talk to you about something."
"EMILY: Yes, Rory, what is it?"
"[There is silence as Rory tries to bring herself to confront Emily. Richard enters the room]"
"RICHARD: I have an announcement. I am going into business with Jason Stiles."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RICHARD: You've met him - the Stiles boy."
"LORELAI: Oh, Digger."
"RICHARD: Nobody's called him Digger in years, Lorelai. And yes, I just got off the phone. We're going to get together later and hash out the details."
"EMILY: Richard, that is wonderful."
"LORELAI: I didn't know you were looking for a partner."
"EMILY: He wasn't. Jason came to him."
"RICHARD: That's right. He said he wanted to strike out on his own, he wanted to work with the best, and he wanted to screw over his father."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: Oh, excuse me, Rory."
"EMILY: You never told me about this."
"RICHARD: Well, I was a bit surprised at the beginning, but I have to admit that when he told me that part of his motive was revenge, I was intrigued. No, I was tickled. I thought it was wonderful. What a wonderful world we live in that the son of my enemy hates his father and that I benefit from it all. It's downright Elizabethan."
"EMILY: I don't think this is very funny, Richard."
"RICHARD: No, no, I suppose not. However, I can't stop smiling."
"EMILY: I don't think you should go into business with this boy."
"RICHARD: Oh, now, Emily."
"EMILY: He's obviously very troubled. You certainly don't need to hand over your business to a troubled youth."
"RICHARD: He's 37 years old."
"EMILY: Yes, he's 37 years old, and all he can think about is how to get back at his father. I don't understand that kind of thinking."
"RICHARD: Well, you know Floyd - he's horrible."
"EMILY: He is the boy's father. He raised him. He clothed him. He fed him. He does not deserve to be paid back for all of his love and devotion like this."
"RICHARD: Why are you getting so upset?"
"EMILY: I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily, be reasonable."
"EMILY: I never liked that Digger in the first place."
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily, come back here."
"[Emily and Richard leave the room. Lorelai clucks like a chicken at Rory]"
"RORY: It wasn't the right moment."
"[Lorelai clucks at her again]"
"RORY: I was about to when Grandpa came in. He interrupted, and now Grandma's mad, so I'm sorry if it seems to you like I chickened out, but I didn't, and now it's just gonna have to wait."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm. [clucks again]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory pulls up in her car, grabs some bags from the trunk, then walks into the house. An alarm starts blaring.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, crap! [tries to turn off the alarm]"
"RORY: What's going on? Is it the smoke detector? Are we on fire?"
"LORELAI: It's not the smoke detector, it's the alarm!"
"RORY: What alarm?"
"LORELAI: Our alarm."
"RORY: We don't have an alarm."
"LORELAI: Well, then, we have really angry rats. Did you cut your hair?"
"RORY: Well, I just trimmed it."
"LORELAI: You didn't tell me you were cutting your hair."
"RORY: It was a spur-of-the-moment thing."
"LORELAI: A spur-of-the-moment, ""let's not tell my mother I'm pulling a G.I. Jane""?"
"RORY: Are we seriously gonna have this conversation now during the air raid?"
"LORELAI: You're right. Come on. [leads her to the other side of the room]"
"RORY: What are we doing?"
"LORELAI: I figured out that there is a motion detector, and if you stand over here, it can't see you and calms down."
"RORY: Great, so what now?"
"LORELAI: We wait. So why didn't you tell me you were getting your hair cut?"
"RORY: It's just a trim."
"LORELAI: To the Braille Institute, it's just a trim."
"RORY: Do you like it?"
"LORELAI: Will you put it back if I don't?"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Yes, I like it."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[the alarm stops]"
"RORY: Oh, thank God."
"LORELAI: Feels good when it's over, huh?"
"RORY: This is crazy. When did we get an alarm?"
"LORELAI: Well, apparently, Kirk. . ."
"RORY: Oh, no."
"LORELAI: . . .has recently joined the Stars Hollow Security Company."
"RORY: Oh, no."
"LORELAI: And apparently, now that I'm the pretty spinster living all alone, he's concerned for my safety."
"RORY: Did he tell you all this?"
"LORELAI: Do you think I labeled myself the pretty spinster?"
"RORY: What did you say?"
"LORELAI: I haven't talked to him face-to-face. I come home to this and there was a note and his card and his g*n."
"RORY: Oh, jeez!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, and then when I called the alarm-response center to complain about the alarm, no one answered. I had to leave a message with Meg - she sweeps up."
"RORY: I can't even believe there's a security company in Stars Hollow. Nothing ever happens here."
"LORELAI: Oh, that is not true. Plenty happens here."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: Like, people now break into your houses and install alarm systems."
"RORY: I heard about that."
"LORELAI: And we have a new mail carrier."
"RORY: We do?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, so now if you wanna get your mail, you just have to go see Miss Patty."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: 'Cause that's where he brings it. He brings Babette's mail to Andrew's, Norma's mail to the deli, and Taylor still hasn't found his mail, which I have to admit is kind of fun."
"RORY: I rescind my previous statement. This place is hopping."
"LORELAI: So, did you eat yet?"
"RORY: Nope. I thought I'd let you feed me."
"LORELAI: Sure. I can feed you, but I can't know if you're getting your hair cut."
"RORY: I will never do anything again without telling you - happy?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I'm finding this whole guilt thing rather satisfying. [Rory starts to walk away] No, no, where are you going? [The alarm starts blaring again] Agh! Why did you do that?"
"RORY: I was gonna get my laundry!"
"LORELAI: You made it mad!"
"RORY: I didn't mean to!"
"LORELAI: Back in the corner, back in the corner!"
"RORY: Oh."
"LORELAI: No place like home, huh?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is making a trail of Post-It notes on the floor through the house; Rory comes out of her bedroom]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Follow the Post-It's."
"RORY: Does our life seem at all ridiculous to you?"
"LORELAI: I spent all morning carefully tracking that motion detector."
"RORY: What an excellent use of your time."
"LORELAI: We're good as long as we stay on the path."
"RORY: So I should follow the yellow stick road?"
"LORELAI: We'll be here all week, try the veal. Stop."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Read."
"RORY: ""Crouch down and hop."" Oh, come on."
"LORELAI: The motion-detector beam at the top of the staircase dips very low over there."
"RORY: You seriously want me to crouch down and hop?"
"LORELAI: Like a little hunchbacked bunny."
"RORY: You know, I had decided that if I ever went to therapy, I was gonna leave you out of it, but now. . ."
"LORELAI: Okay, you can stand up."
"RORY: Did you at least call the stupid security company again?"
"LORELAI: Yes, Meg sends her love. Don't worry - I'll stop by on my way to the inn. And what are your plans today, Persis Khambata?"
"RORY: Well, today, I'm going to do nothing but hang out in town, read, veg, drink coffee, and have the perfect Stars Hollow day."
"LORELAI: Look out. I get to go over to the inn and hear a contractor laugh at me every time I say, ""But that won't cost too much more, right?"""
"RORY: Enjoy."
"LORELAI: Late lunch at Luke's?"
"RORY: You're on. So, uh, which way do I go?"
"LORELAI: Oh, just follow the Post-It's."
"RORY: But they're going in two different directions."
"LORELAI: They are?"
"RORY: Look."
"LORELAI: Oh. I must have kicked some out of the way by accident."
"RORY: Well, which one do I take?"
"LORELAI: Which looks more intentional?"
"RORY: No Post-It path looks intentional."
"LORELAI: I'm drawing a complete blank."
"RORY: You seriously don't remember?"
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: Well, how are we supposed to get out of our house?"
"[Lorelai, imitating Jeannie from I Dream of Jeannie, crosses her arms, nods her head, and blinks]"
"LORELAI: Unng!"
"RORY: I hate Kirk."
"CUT TO THE GAZEBO"
"[Rory is sitting on the bench reading and listening to music. A man walks up and sets down a box]"
"RORY: Whoa. What's going on?"
"MAN: I'm just setting things up for tomorrow."
"RORY: Oh, tomorrow. What's -"
"MAN 2: Heads up!"
"[another man throws a package of tablecloths to the man in the gazebo]"
"RORY: Whoa."
"MAN: I think you may need to move."
"RORY: Yeah, I kinda got that. Excuse me. What's tomorrow?"
"[Across the lawn, Lindsay and her mom are talking with a wedding planner]"
"LINDSAY: . . .tons of tulle so that everything looks like frosting."
"MRS. LISTER: She's our only daughter - frost the town."
"LINDSAY: Now, where should we put the poster? I want to make sure everybody sees it."
"MRS. LISTER: Oh, what about next to the cake?"
"LINDSAY: Yes, next to the cake."
"[Rory walks away in the other direction]"
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Lane."
"LANE: Rory."
"RORY: Have you heard of a phone? Because as my friend, it is your responsibility to use it to call me and tell me that my ex-boyfriend's wedding is on Sunday so I'm not accidentally in it."
"LANE: What?"
"RORY: I'm sitting out in the gazebo, reading, and this guy almost brains me with a stack of tablecloths."
"LANE: Oh, that's right, they're having their reception in the town square."
"RORY: Yes, and Lindsay was out there holding a giant picture of her with Dean, and. . ."
"LANE: Oh my God, did she see you?"
"RORY: I don't think so. I do a pretty good idiot run when I need to."
"LANE: I'm sorry, I meant to tell you. I just didn't know you were coming home this weekend. It totally slipped my mind. Things have been so crazy. I just figured I'd tell you when we talked, and then we didn't, and. . .oh, I'm sorry, can you hold on for a sec?"
"[She opens an armoire. Zach and Brian are inside]"
"ZACH: Not cool, Lane."
"LANE: I'm sorry, guys."
"BRIAN: Fourth time today."
"LANE: Well, I thought Rory was my mom."
"ZACH: The resemblance is uncanny."
"BRIAN: We should get your mom a bell like a cat."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LANE: We're having a band meeting. We need to figure out what to do about a guitarist."
"BRIAN: I think I got a splinter."
"ZACH: You know that a splinter can get into your bloodstream, go straight to your heart, and k*ll you."
"BRIAN: Why would you tell me that?"
"ZACH: Whatever, dude. This is lame. I'm gonna bail."
"LANE: Zach, come on."
"BRIAN: We need to find a guitarist."
"LANE: That's right. We have come too far to let the band fall apart just because Dave -"
"ZACH: Hey, do not say the ""d"" word, Lane."
"LANE: But -"
"ZACH: Don't."
"LANE: Dave -"
"ZACH: Dave is dead to me. Comprendo? Dead. Cover the mirror, rip a shirt, that guy doesn't exist."
"BRIAN: He just went to college, Zach."
"ZACH: No, he did not just go to college. He walked out on his art, man. He walked out on his sound. Do you think a sound is so easy to find? Did you ever see that Glenn Miller movie? For two hours, Jimmy Stewart's walking around, ""I gotta find a sound. I gotta find a sound."" Well, we had a sound and Dave took that sound to freaking California. You don't come back from California, man. It changes you."
"LANE: What did you expect him to do - not go to college?"
"ZACH: No true rock 'n' roller goes to college!"
"RORY: Mick Jagger went to the London School of Economics."
"ZACH: What?"
"RORY: Yeah, and, uh, Dexter Holland of The Offspring got his PhD in molecular biology at USC. Greg Ginn of Black Flag graduated from UCLA. The guy from Bad Religion got his masters in geology from UCLA, and he's working on his PhD in evolutionary biology at Cornell."
"ZACH: Lane, she's your friend."
"RORY: I'm sorry. Um, I'm going. I'll call you later."
"LANE: Hey, are you mad?"
"RORY: No, I'm not, I promise. I'm just - I'm just a little surprised. I mean, Dean's wedding. . ."
"LANE: I know."
"RORY: But it's okay. It just means that I have to be a little more careful about where I go this weekend, that's all."
"LANE: Okay, well, I'll see you tomorrow. We're using the garage - guitar auditions."
"RORY: Okay, I'll see you tomorrow."
"ZACH: Shut up, shut up, shut up. Weezer did not go to Harvard."
"BRIAN: Not the whole band, just the lead -"
"ZACH: Get away from me! I mean it."
"RORY: Bye."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Rory leaves. She sees Dean out front on the sidewalk]"
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: Hi. Uh, were you. . ."
"RORY: Oh, I was at, uh, Lane's."
"DEAN: Right, Lane's. Um."
"RORY: Um."
"DEAN: So, you're home this weekend."
"RORY: Yeah, I, uh, I ran out of clean clothes and quarters, so. . .how are things?"
"DEAN: Good. You?"
"RORY: Good."
"DEAN: You like Yale?"
"RORY: I love Yale."
"DEAN: I figured."
"RORY: And Connecticut State?"
"DEAN: It's. . .it's good."
"RORY: Oh, good. I'm glad it's good. I mean, not that I would have had any recourse if it wasn't, but, uh, this makes my lack of recourse a lot easier to deal with. So, I see you've taken over the town."
"DEAN: Oh, yeah. Uh, well, Lindsay thought. . .she likes the gazebo, and. . ."
"RORY: And it's her wedding."
"DEAN: It is her wedding."
"RORY: And your wedding. I mean, it's your wedding, too."
"DEAN: Yes, it is. It's my wedding, too."
"RORY: Well, it's nice. It's, um, it's pretty. It looks like heaven or a Victoria's Secret commercial, which, to some people is basically the same thing."
"DEAN: I didn't know you'd be home this weekend."
"RORY: It was just a spur-of-the-moment thing."
"DEAN: Because if I had known, I would have, you know, invited you."
"RORY: Oh. Oh, well, it's. . ."
"DEAN: I mean, I didn't want you to think I was just not inviting you."
"RORY: No, I didn't think that."
"DEAN: I just figured you'd be at school."
"RORY: 'Cause you're logical."
"DEAN: I just didn't know."
"RORY: No, I know you didn't know."
"DEAN: I didn't want you to think -"
"RORY: No, I didn't think. I don't think. I go to Yale now. They think for you."
"DEAN: But, hey, since you are here, come."
"RORY: Come?"
"DEAN: To my wedding. Come to my wedding."
"RORY: Oh, Dean. . ."
"DEAN: You and Lorelai, I want you to."
"RORY: Well. . ."
"DEAN: Chicken or beef?"
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: Wait, beef. Of course, beef. I mean, the two of you are definitely beef. I mean, not like you resemble beef or anything."
"RORY: You know, you don't even have to -"
"DEAN: Okay, so, noon at the church. I'll be the one in the tux. And don't worry, we didn't write our own vows and no one's singing opera. I know you think that's lame."
"RORY: Oh, no, well, it's a wedding. It's supposed to be. . .operatic."
"DEAN: Okay, so, I better get over there. Lindsay's expecting me. Uh, so, I'll just see you two tomorrow."
"RORY: But. . ."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is in the living room staring at the alarm system control pad]"
"KIRK: [calls from upstairs] Now?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"KIRK: What about now?"
"LORELAI: No, nothing."
"KIRK: Okay. Now?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. Kirk, what's supposed to happen?"
"KIRK: What?"
"LORELAI: I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for. Kirk?"
"KIRK: I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: Kirk, please come downstairs."
"KIRK: Are you going to hurt me?"
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: [walking downstairs] I swear, they told me it would be self-explanatory. I just had to get in the main box, and in seconds, this thing would be disabled. They didn't tell me that I needed a key or that if I didn't have a key, that I would be mildly electrocuted, and then, after all that, when I got in the box, there's nothing self-explanatory about it."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: I was trying to do a nice thing."
"LORELAI: I know."
"KIRK: And Jimmy said he would install it for me because I do not have those k*ll yet. The class was full by the time I got there."
"LORELAI: That's okay."
"KIRK: Damn my constant tardiness."
"LORELAI: Kirk, please, what can we do right now? The alarm is just so loud."
"KIRK: Yeah, that's my fault, too. I asked Jimmy to really crank it up."
"LORELAI: Well, he did."
"KIRK: If you're gonna have an alarm, you need it loud. You don't want some crazed, knife-wielding g*n at your throat and the neighbors are going, like, ""Is that a fan? Did I leave the water running?"" You want them to know, ""Hey, that's an alarm."""
"LORELAI: Your imaginary attacker has a knife and a g*n?"
"KIRK: And a really dirty t*nk top."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, uh, Jimmy's out of town, but until he gets back, we can. . ."
"KIRK: Change the code."
"LORELAI: Really? To something I know?"
"KIRK: You can pick it."
"LORELAI: You know how to do that?"
"KIRK: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: That is perfect."
"KIRK: Okay, here we go. Just punch in a 7-number sequence."
"LORELAI: You got it."
"[Sookie walks in]"
"SOOKIE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"SOOKIE: Did you know your phone's not working?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I've been calling you for an hour. I had the operator check it. She said it's cut off or something."
"LORELAI: It was working this morning."
"KIRK: I'll be right back."
"LORELAI: Kirk!"
"KIRK: I have tape. [goes upstairs]"
"SOOKIE: You look tired."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, Kirk."
"SOOKIE: Right. Hey, listen, I got a call today."
"LORELAI: From?"
"SOOKIE: Michel. A very upset Michel."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"SOOKIE: Well, apparently, he called you and you never called him back."
"LORELAI: When did he call me?"
"SOOKIE: He said he called you in July."
"LORELAI: I was in Europe in July."
"SOOKIE: I think that he thinks we're trying to ease him out of the Dragonfly."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on. Why would he think that?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know, but he was so hysterical that his voice got into that high-pitched squeal he does, and all I could make out was ""fire"" and ""abandon me"" and something about not receiving a thank-you card for the Statue of Liberty."
"LORELAI: That is crazy. He knows we always intended to take him with us. I mean, we love Michel, right?"
"SOOKIE: Right. He's the best concierge in the world."
"LORELAI: Absolutely. A little abrasive."
"SOOKIE: Kind of impatient."
"LORELAI: But charming."
"SOOKIE: And great at what he does, knows the community."
"LORELAI: Willing to go that extra mile."
"SOOKIE: Tiny bit obnoxious."
"LORELAI: Makes you want to scream, ""life's too short!"" two, three times a day, but. . ."
"SOOKIE: Picture life without him. We do need him, right?"
"LORELAI: Let's just go down there and talk to him."
"SOOKIE: Right."
"CUT TO FANCY HOTEL"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk in]"
"LORELAI: Well, we know where all those Calvin Klein ads went to die."
"SOOKIE: They look like they all had the same mother."
"LORELAI: That must be one tired supermodel."
"[a woman walks by]"
"LORELAI: Excuse me, we're look-"
"[the woman ignores her and keeps walking]"
"LORELAI: I wouldn't talk to us either."
"SOOKIE: Hey, talk to a boy. A boy will be nice to you."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[they walk up to the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Hi. Excuse me, we're looking for Michel Gerard."
"CONCIERGE: The corner of Mercer and Broom."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"[the man points to his headset]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Janet Jackson's on the phone."
"SOOKIE: Oh."
"CONCIERGE: Uh huh, no worries. Hi."
"SOOKIE: Us?"
"CONCIERGE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"SOOKIE: We're looking for Michel Gerard."
"CONCIERGE: Michel."
"SOOKIE: Yes, Michel Ger. . . Janet again."
"LORELAI: She's very needy lately."
"CONCIERGE: You have some guests at the front desk. Uh-huh. No worries. He comes like the wind."
"LORELAI: Thanks. He doesn't need our thanks."
"SOOKIE: Well, he has Janet, so. . ."
"[Michel walks through the lobby toward the front desk talking on a headset]"
"MICHEL: You have reservations at Tamtam at 7:00. Do not order the duck because it will take forever and you will miss the curtain. If you have any problems at all, you have my pager number. Just call me. Goodbye. [to Lorelai and Sookie] Well, look who the cat dragged in."
"LORELAI: Hi, Michel. We've missed you."
"MICHEL: Yes? Well, I have missed you, too."
"LORELAI: This place is wonderful."
"SOOKIE: You look so important, walking around, talking to yourself. But you're not really talking to yourself. You're actually talking to someone else in a headset with your headset."
"LORELAI: How are you?"
"MICHEL: Me? I am wonderful, and yourselves?"
"LORELAI: We're great, and we're breaking ground on the inn on Monday."
"MICHEL: Oh, yes. Is that still happening?"
"LORELAI: It is still happening."
"MICHEL: Well, that's lovely. There's a small charge for the use of the internet. All instructions are in the minibar. I'm so pleased."
"LORELAI: Listen, Michel, I know you're a little upset with me."
"MICHEL: Upset? I don't think so."
"SOOKIE: It's okay, I told her about the call."
"MICHEL: What call?"
"SOOKIE: The call you made to me yesterday, the one where you told me that you called Lorelai and she didn't call back."
"MICHEL: I make so many calls."
"SOOKIE: The one where you cried."
"MICHEL: Are you sure it wasn't another Michel?"
"SOOKIE: You called me! You kept me on the phone for over an hour. I missed the beginning of q*eer Eye for the Straight Guy, and by the time I got back, they were all gay."
"LORELAI: Okay, it doesn't matter. We just want you to know if there was any misunderstanding about wanting you to come with us to the Dragonfly, well, we're sorry."
"SOOKIE: I'm not."
"MICHEL: Well, that's very sweet of you to say. Thank you."
"LORELAI: Unless you don't want to come with us. I mean, this place is very impressive, and I would understand if you didn't want to leave."
"MICHEL: Yes, this place is impressive, isn't it? I mean, the uniform alone - like working in your jammies. And these headsets, are they not fabulous? Especially when, for example, you're in the bathroom, a place one would normally choose to be alone, then suddenly, bang, someone is yakking in your ear. How delightful. You can never get lonely."
"LORELAI: I suppose not."
"MICHEL: And the people who work here. . .a joy. So young, so talented. Some of them are actors in ambitious off-Broadway revues. They play cockroaches and derelicts and do Shakespeare dressed like punk rockers. It gives me chills just thinking about it. Yes, extra towels are complimentary, Matthew, and stop asking me who the hottie I'm talking to is. I'll tell you what, I'll think about it and get back to you, okay?"
"LORELAI: Nice to have you aboard, Michel."
"MICHEL: I'm busy, go. Thank God. Matthew, what?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: So, he invited us to his wedding."
"RORY: And we're having beef."
"LORELAI: Well, what was his body language like?"
"RORY: Tall."
"LORELAI: No, I mean, did he squirm or back away when he invited you or was he all darty-eyed?"
"RORY: Not much squirming, no backing away, but there was a little bit of darty-eye."
"LORELAI: So, he was nervous."
"RORY: Well, we were both nervous. I mean, we didn't expect to run into each other, and I think he probably just invited us 'cause he felt like he had to, to be nice."
"LORELAI: That does sound like Dean."
"RORY: So, what do we do? Do we go?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I can't decide this. He's your ex-boyfriend."
"RORY: It seems weird that we go."
"LORELAI: Then we don't go."
"RORY: But if we don't go, it may look like we're trying to make some kind of statement."
"LORELAI: Then we go."
"RORY: If I had just stayed at Lane's for two more minutes. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah, fate."
"RORY: Yes, it is fate. Do we ignore fate?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Do you have any important papers due soon?"
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Just in case."
"RORY: Fate's gonna flunk me?"
"LORELAI: It's always a possibility."
"RORY: Well, then that's it. We are going."
"LUKE: Going where?"
"RORY: Dean's wedding. Fate's making us."
"LORELAI: I hope fate will cough up forty bucks for a salad spinner for him."
"LUKE: Please, there is no fate."
"LORELAI: What do you mean there is no fate? Of course there is fate."
"LUKE: There is no fate, there is no destiny, there is no luck. Astrology is ridiculous. Tarot cards tell you nothing. You cannot read a palm. Tea leaves make tea and nothing else. Jim Morrison is not hanging out with Elvis, and the Kennedys did not k*ll Marilyn."
"LORELAI: I totally knew you were gonna say that."
"LUKE: I came over here. My fault."
"LORELAI: I read your mind. It spoke to me. We're psychic."
"LUKE: Enjoy the fries."
"LORELAI: So where does this leave us?"
"RORY: Well, I think that Dean's gonna expect us to go, and it is his day, and I don't want him to feel like I don't care about him."
"LORELAI: I know."
"ORY: I just want him to be happy."
"LORELAI: Okay, we'll get him a salad spinner first thing tomorrow morning."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[Miss Patty walks in]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, there you are. Honey, I've got your mail."
"LORELAI: Oh, great."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, I'm exhausted. I've been looking all over town for you."
"LORELAI: Oh, Patty, you could have just left me a message. I would have stopped by and picked it up."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, there was something marked urgent in there, and I just wanted to make sure you got it."
"LORELAI: Hm, thank you."
"MISS PATTY: All right, I'm leaving. Oh, I'm gonna k*ll that mail carrier. I don't care if he doesn't have a tongue. [leaves]"
"RORY: Our new mail carrier doesn't have a tongue?"
"LORELAI: You've got to be kidding me."
"RORY: That's what Patty just said."
"LORELAI: No, Taylor has sent me a cease and desist order on the inn."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: [reads letter] ""Dear Lorelai Gilmore, it has come to the attention of the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society that you and Miss Sookie St. James intend to commence construction on the Dragonfly Inn. Any proposed renovations must be submitted, discussed, and approved by the Stars Hollow Historical Preservation Society. We must therefore ask that all work halt until such time that this procedure has been followed. Thank you, and have a historical day."" Is he kidding?"
"RORY: What are you gonna do?"
"LORELAI: I'm going to talk to him."
"RORY: Cool."
"LORELAI: Don't say cool like that. It's gonna be very pleasant."
"RORY: I thought you said you were gonna go talk to Taylor."
"LORELAI: I own my own business now, Rory. I'm gonna have to deal with tiny men like Taylor all the time. You can't go around yelling at people, no matter how historical they might be."
"RORY: Bummer."
"LORELAI: You have to learn to separate the personal from the business."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they walk outside and head toward the soda shop]"
"LORELAI: Remember in The Godfather, Michael telling Sonny how he was gonna k*ll Tattaglia and Captain McCluskey in that Italian restaurant? He lays out the whole thing very calmly, very unemotionally, 'cause that's what you do in business."
"RORY: Yeah, but then he went and sh*t two guys in the head."
"LORELAI: Okay, but I wasn't describing that scene."
"CUT TO THE SODA SHOP"
"TAYLOR: [to customer] But if you know you already like lime, then you're not sampling, you're savoring, and that's just gluttonous."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Hi, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Well, hello there. Lorelai, Rory, what can I get for you?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, gosh, look at all the choices, really hard to pick. I think I'll try a scoop of butter brickle crunch. Rory?"
"RORY: I'll try the chocolate chocolate chocolate."
"TAYLOR: Coming right up."
"LORELAI: Listen, Taylor, while I have you here, um, I received this letter in the mail, and I'm having kind of a blond day, and I wonder if you could explain this to me."
"TAYLOR: Well, it says you have to get approval before you can start construction on the inn."
"LORELAI: That's what I thought it said. Well, I have to tell you, Taylor, I'm a little concerned because we have a construction crew coming Monday, so. . .yikes."
"TAYLOR: Well, the Dragonfly is a historical building, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but the whole town is a historical building, Taylor. I mean, George Washington ate, slept, or blew his nose all over the damn place."
"TAYLOR: He only blew his nose in the park. You've read the sign."
"LORELAI: Taylor, that inn needs love. It's falling down. Sookie and I have no intention of ruining its historical aspect. We'd just like some running water."
"TAYLOR: Running water was not always historical."
"LORELAI: You're not seriously telling me I can't put in running water?"
"RORY: Oh, my God, this is incredible. It's called chocolate chocolate chocolate, but it's seriously chocolate chocolate chocolaty. Sorry."
"TAYLOR: I'm just telling you, there are rules and they have to be followed."
"LORELAI: Fine. What do I have to do to get the Historical Preservation Society's stamp of approval?"
"TAYLOR: Well, a formal presentation is necessary."
"LORELAI: Uh-huh. When?"
"TAYLOR: Uh, any town function or gathering is open to a presentation, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, like, the town meeting tonight?"
"TAYLOR: If you like."
"LORELAI: The town meeting it is."
"TAYLOR: Oh, now, don't look sad. I went through this with my place, too. Of course, I knew the rules so I didn't get the embarrassing letter."
"LORELAI: Right, okay, great. Well, we'll see you later, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Oh, uh. . ."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"TAYLOR: That'll be $3.50 for the ice cream."
"RORY: And worth every penny, let me tell you. Sorry, but this is really good."
"CUT TO TOWN MEETING"
"TAYLOR: So, any additional landscaping to the town square will be paid for directly from the town park funds, and town park funds only. All righty."
"RORY: Long one tonight."
"LORELAI: Astonishingly long."
"SOOKIE: We've got to be next, right?"
"LORELAI: We've got to be. Michel, are you okay over there?"
"SOOKIE: He says the guy next to him has unforgivable B.O."
"LORELAI: Michel, you're French. How can you even tell?"
"TAYLOR: Could we have a little quiet please?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, Taylor, we're just waiting here very patiently, as you can see, all ready and everything."
"TAYLOR: Yes, well, um, the next item, people, is a wonderful feather in Stars Hollow's cap. One of our very own, fourth grader Donny Pass, was named a runner-up in the Connecticut State story-writing contest for his work entitled The Happiest Doughnut."
"SOOKIE: I think I'm gonna give birth just out of boredom."
"TAYLOR: Donny's mom is here tonight. Let's give her a big hand."
"LORELAI: I almost think he's doing this on purpose."
"SOOKIE: Almost? Huh."
"LORELAI: Bordering on pretty damn sure."
"TAYLOR: I won't spoil the plot of The Happiest Doughnut for you, folks, except to say it's funny and a little sad and truly inspiring. But a caveat for all you parents - the dunking scene may be too intense for preschool-aged children."
"GYPSY: How can a stupid doughnut be happy?"
"RORY: But see, he's got you curious. That's the genius of Donny Pass."
"GYPSY: Hey, I've got a bunch of your mail. Here."
"RORY: Oh, I've got some of yours, too, and some of Al's. Will you pass this back to him for me?"
"GYPSY: Yeah. Oh, if you hand this up to Andrew."
"RORY: Can do."
"[The townspeople start exchanging their mail]"
"LORELAI: I can't smell anything."
"MICHEL: I'm breathing it all in so it's not reaching you."
"LORELAI: Thanks for taking that grenade for me, pal."
"TAYLOR: People, could we have some order here?"
"ANDREW: Oh, Gypsy, the letter from my girlfriend's open."
"GYPSY: Oh, yeah. Sorry, Andrew. It must have fallen open accidentally."
"ANDREW: You read my private letter."
"GYPSY: There's nothing private in that letter. Except for the medical stuff."
"MISS PATTY: Taylor, I got your PennySaver and your girly magazines."
"TAYLOR: Those are lifestyle magazines. People, this meeting has degenerated into our usual weekly anarchy. I say we adjourn. We'll see you next week."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Uh, Taylor!"
"TAYLOR: Everyone pick up a free copy of The Happiest Doughnut on your way out. You won't be sorry."
"LORELAI: Taylor, wait, we were supposed to make our presentation about the Dragonfly."
"TAYLOR: Oh, yes. Well, uh, you're bringing this up kind of late."
"LORELAI: Well, we've been sitting here."
"SOOKIE: It won't take long."
"LORELAI: It was your idea, remember? You suggested this."
"TAYLOR: Well, okay. People, your children and elderly are going to have to wait a while longer for you to get home because Lorelai Gilmore and her associates want to discuss some proposed changes to a beloved town structure."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Let's go, Sook, Augustus Gloop."
"RORY: Knock 'em dead."
"LORELAI: Guys, I know we've been here forever, but I very quickly want to tell you what we have in mind for this beautiful Dragonfly property."
"TAYLOR: The historic Dragonfly property."
"LORELAI: I think that goes without saying."
"TAYLOR: I don't think you should try to hide the fact that it's historic."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm not hiding anything."
"TAYLOR: Proceed, please."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, we're very excited -"
"TAYLOR: How many guest rooms will this establishment have?"
"LORELAI: Um, ten."
"TAYLOR: Ugh, tsk, tsk, tsk."
"LORELAI: Yeah, ten. Anyway, the property's been unoccupied for -"
"TAYLOR: And parking? How many parking spaces?"
"LORELAI: Um, eighteen."
"TAYLOR: Oh, hm."
"LORELAI: Something wrong with the parking, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Two people to a room, each with their own car, that's twenty cars - you don't have enough parking."
"LORELAI: But some of the people will be driving there together in one car."
"TAYLOR: So, you have a crystal ball, do you?"
"LORELAI: That's just common sense."
"TAYLOR: Because if you have a crystal ball, I sure would like to borrow it to take to the racetrack."
"LORELAI: Um, no, I don't have a crystal ball, but if the parking's not enough, we can always add more."
"SOOKIE: Easy."
"TAYLOR: So, pave paradise and put up a parking lot."
"SOOKIE: Not what we're saying."
"TAYLOR: I heard you were planning to serve alcohol - is this true?"
"LORELAI: Well, there will be a restaurant."
"SOOKIE: Wine, cocktails. Give the people what they want."
"TAYLOR: So it'll be a party spot, huh?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"TAYLOR: Catering to that crowd - hip-hoppers, the Manson family."
"LORELAI: It's a little country inn."
"TAYLOR: A perfect secluded spot for m*rder to revel in impropriety."
"MICHEL: Have you noticed, this is not going very well."
"LORELAI: Taylor, everyone, there will be millions of questions, some of them even legitimate, but the bottom line is, you know me. I've been apart of this town for. . .well, look how big my daughter is - for that long. And opening this inn has been a dream of mine and of Sookie's for most of that time. Along with Michel, we plan to make this community as proud of the historic Dragonfly Inn as you were when the same team was running the Independence Inn."
"TAYLOR: You mean the place that b*rned down on your watch?"
"MICHEL: Can I slap him?"
"LORELAI: Uh, now, this will also help our local economy because we plan to employ. . .[her cell phone rings] Sorry, we plan to employ - huh. Uh, this, uh, call is coming from the house."
"RORY: Our house?"
"LORELAI: It's flashing our number."
"RORY: But we're here."
"LORELAI: I know. That's the weird part. Sookie, uh, keep it going in here. I'll be just a quick, um, second."
"SOOKIE: Okay, if you have any questions. . ."
"MICHEL: Yes, about the Dragonfly or deodorant - the places to buy it, how to apply it, that sort of thing."
"[Lorelai goes outside to answer her phone]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"KIRK: I responded to the activation of an alarm at your residence, and I apprehended a prowler in the garage."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"KIRK: Yes, ma'am - female, approximately eighteen years old, Korean."
"LORELAI: Kirk, that's Lane. You know Lane."
"KIRK: I thought I knew Lane, but now I think she's in some kind of gang."
"LANE: Lorelai, help."
"KIRK: Their front is some sort of musical group."
"LORELAI: They are a musical group, Kirk. [to Rory] Honey, go sort it out."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: Rory's on her way over - brown hair, blue eyes, about 5'6"" - don't cuff her."
"KIRK: 10-4."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Lorelai hangs up as Sookie and Michel walk out of the dance studio]"
"LORELAI: What -"
"SOOKIE: We failed you."
"MICHEL: He is a very unpleasant man."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"SOOKIE: The second, I mean, the second you walked out the door, Taylor adjourned the meeting over our objections."
"LORELAI: Well, where is he? Where'd he go?"
"SOOKIE: He was the first one out the door."
"LORELAI: Unbelievable. Hm, you can run but you can't hide."
"MICHEL: Oh, this is cute. . . The Happy Doughnut."
"[Lorelai goes to catch up to Taylor]"
"LORELAI: Hey, uh, we have a little misunderstanding back there, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Lorelai, please don't sneak up on me like that. I almost blew my emergency whistle."
"LORELAI: We weren't done."
"TAYLOR: Oh, I thought we were."
"LORELAI: No, we weren't."
"TAYLOR: Well, what more was there to say?"
"LORELAI: Nothing was decided. You said to come to the town meeting and explain what you're doing, then we can start our work."
"TAYOR: Oh, well, you can't do that until after the walk-through."
"LORELAI: Oh, Taylor, I'm in heels. Do you mind? What walk-through?"
"TAYLOR: I and other members of the Historical Preservation Society need to examine the property in person. You didn't think we were gonna make a decision based on a little chat, did you? I'm sure I mentioned a walk-through."
"LORELAI: I don't think you did."
"TAYLOR: Well, I'm mentioning it now."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, when's the walk-through?"
"TAYLOR: Well, I'd have to check with the other society members, set something up in the next month or so."
"LORELAI: But I have workmen coming Monday, Taylor, the day after tomorrow."
"TAYLOR: Oh, dear. That's cutting it pretty close."
"LORELAI: Let's do it tomorrow, please - tomorrow."
"TAYLOR: Tomorrow's Sunday."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"TAYLOR: Well, it would have to be before church."
"LORELAI: Okay, so midmorning?"
"TAYLOR: Six?"
"LORELAI: Six? Six in the morning?"
"TAYLOR: Or another day - I could take it up with the society."
"LORELAI: No, no, six is fine. Six sharp."
"TAYLOR: See you then."
"LORELAI: Bright and early."

"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"CUSTOMER: Goodnight."
"LUKE: Goodnight. Thanks."
"[A group of boys are walking toward the diner]"
"BOYS: [singing] We do or die for Stars Hollow High! We do or die for Stars Hollow High! It's the one we fight and fall for, it's the one we give our all for."
"LUKE: Oh, goody."
"[the boys enter the diner]"
"BOYS: Stars Hollow High! Whoo!"
"BOY 1: That is our Stars Hollow High fight song."
"LUKE: Could've sworn it was Mozart. What is this, guys?"
"KYLE: Pit stop!"
"BOYS: Whoo!"
"KYLE: Bachelor party, phase one is over."
"BOY 2: Our boy Dean here is tying the knot."
"LUKE: Look, I was just closing up."
"DEAN: Luke!"
"LUKE: Dean!"
"DEAN: That's funny."
"LUKE: I wasn't even trying."
"KYLE: We just need to refuel for phase two, sir. It won't take long."
"DEAN: You wouldn't turn away a man on his wedding day, would you?"
"LUKE: It's not your wedding day yet."
"BOY 1: That's what I keep telling him, dude. It's your last day of freedom."
"BOY 2: Hey, we should get strippers, right?"
"DEAN: And cake."
"BOY 3: Hey, my name's Luke, too. We should start a club or something."
"LUKE: Yeah, that would be swell. Look, guys, why don't you go sit down over there? I'll make some coffee."
"DEAN: Tomorrow is the big day, man - big day."
"LUKE: You're tipping there, Dean. Watch him."
"KYLE: I got him, sir. We really appreciate this, sir."
"LUKE: Stop calling me that."
"DEAN: He's a good guy, really."
"LUKE: So, what was phase one?"
"KYLE: A case of beer in the JC Penney parking lot, then batting cages and laser tag."
"DEAN: I've decided that I really like beer."
"KYLE: I'm the designated driver."
"LUKE: Good man."
"KYLE: I'm in the Navy now, you know."
"LUKE: Uniform tipped me off."
"KYLE: My older cousins did two-year stints. It paid for their college and stuff, so I joined up. Of course, we weren't fighting international skirmishes on two or three dangerous fronts like we are now."
"LUKE: Hey, what are you doing?"
"BOY 2: Sugar football."
"LUKE: Don't."
"KYLE: Come on, guys, respect the establishment. They're still kids."
"LUKE: I got a better idea, guys. How about I whip up some pancakes real fast, help soak up whatever it is you drank?"
"KYLE: Sounds good. We'll be needing energy for phase two."
"BOY 2: Strippers, right? We gotta get strippers."
"BOY 3: Hey, how much do you give a stripper?"
"BOY 1: Well, that depends on what she does."
"KYLE: Are they really prostitutes? 'Cause I'd feel bad if they were prostitutes."
"LUKE: Look, guys, I gotta go in the back for a couple seconds. Don't drink anymore. Don't play jets. Don't jump on the furniture. Just sit still, okay?"
"BOY 2: And do what?"
"LUKE: I don't know. Make up a dirty version of the fight song or something."
"BOY 1: Yeah!"
"BOY 2: Great idea!"
"DEAN: [mumbles] Rory."
"BOY 3: What did he say?"
"BOY 1: Oh, he is so toasted."
"DEAN: [mumbles] Rory."
"KYLE: Did he say what I think he said?"
"LUKE: Hey guys, you know what I think? I think it's real late and that maybe you ought to cancel phase two."
"BOY 1: No way."
"KYLE: Hear him out, fellas."
"LUKE: I mean, think about it, guys - how you gonna b*at laser tag?"
"BOY 1: I don't know."
"BOY 2: Aw, is Dean sick?"
"LUKE: He just needs his rest. Kyle, why don't you march your friends out of here? I'll take care of the groom, and he'll see you all tomorrow."
"KYLE: He's right, guys. Let's saddle up."
"BOY 2: Aren't we getting pancakes?"
"BOY 1: I'm not feeling good."
"LUKE: Come on, big guy."
"DEAN: What?"
"LUKE: Try to walk."
"[The boys leave, singing the fight song. Luke takes Dean upstairs to his apartment]"
"LUKE: Here we are."
"DEAN: She's smart, man. You know, she's so smart."
"LUKE: I know, I know."
"DEAN: She could probably fix the world, you know?"
"LUKE: Right, right. She could team up with Kyle - her brains, his brawn."
"DEAN: No, not Kyle - Rory."
"LUKE: Almost there."
"DEAN: She's the one, you know?"
"[Luke walks Dean over to the bed]"
"LUKE: Come on, Dean, just slide down there, stop talking."
"DEAN: And the hair - pretty hair. She has the prettiest hair. And that head. What is that?"
"LUKE: Just your shoes. Shh."
"DEAN: I miss her. Why didn't she love me?"
"CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are standing out front while the Historical Preservation Society members look over the property]"
"SOOKIE: Scrubbing shower grout with a toothbrush."
"LORELAI: Sure, sure. Flossing with that really, really fine floss that cuts between your teeth like a razor."
"SOOKIE: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Staring into the sun."
"LORELAI: 'Til you're blind."
"SOOKIE: Absolutely."
"[Michel walks over]"
"MICHEL: I feel very ugly this morning."
"LORELAI: Join the crowd."
"MICHEL: That unpleasant man and his cohorts in there?"
"LORELAI: And have been for about thirty frickin' minutes."
"SOOKIE: Watching a foreign movie without subtitles."
"LORELAI: Getting brain freeze from eating ice cream."
"MICHEL: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: We're listing all the things we'd rather be doing than this."
"SOOKIE: What a mug."
"LORELAI: It's like he sucked a lemon."
"MICHEL: I've really grown to hate him."
"LORELAI: Nice, huh?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, so much potential."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"TAYLOR: It needs a lot of TLC."
"LORELAI: And we've got an abundance of it, Taylor. [quietly to Patty] Patty, please, please, help, help. He's k*ll me here, and you've got pull with him."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, honey, I got my own remodeling to do on my studio that Taylor has to approve. I'm saving my pull for me."
"LORELAI: Can't I have just a little teeny, tiny bit of your pull, please?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, he's gonna see us talking."
"TAYLOR: Lorelai, consultation, please."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"TAYLOR: This porch is falling apart."
"LORELAI: I know."
"TAYLOR: It's got live termites."
"LORELAI: Big, fat ones."
"TAYLOR: It's a safety hazard."
"LORELAI: It's the first thing to go."
"TAYLOR: To go? This porch can't go."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, Taylor. You just said it's falling apart."
"TAYLOR: I didn't tell you to tear it down. It's historical. It has to stay."
"LORELAI: No, no, the porch is not historical, Taylor. It was added in 1980."
"TAYLOR: So?"
"LORELAI: So it's a 23-year-old porch. Unless you think Kate Hudson is historical, it's not historical."
"TAYLOR: Not now, but how do you think we get historical 200-year-old structures if we tear 'em down when they're just 23?"
"LORELAI: Uh, it's rotting away."
"TAYLOR: Which just means that your guests can't walk on it."
"LORELAI: So they should hover over it?"
"TAYLOR: No, you could build a bridge over it, using appropriate materials, of course."
"LORELAI: A bridge?"
"TAYLOR: Or you could build a transparent Lucite porch over this porch, so people could walk on the Lucite porch and see the old porch underneath the new porch."
"LORELAI: Build a clear plastic porch over the rotting wood porch?"
"TAYLOR: With the proper permits, of course, and those are hard to come by."
"LORELAI: That's it!"
"TAYLOR: Lorelai, watch it. I've got church later."
"LORELAI: What did I do to make you torture me like this, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: I don't know what you're talking about."
"LORELAI: The hoops! The hoops with the jumping and the fire and the hoops!"
"TAYLOR: It's just business, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I pay to shop in your store. I eat your banana splits. I've never physically hurt you. . .except for that one spit wad in the one town meeting, but I didn't mean for it to hit your eye and I apologized profusely, so please, please, put me out of my misery and tell me what I need to do to make this thing happen!"
"TAYLOR: I want an ice-cream truck."
"LORELAI: What?"
"TAYLOR: I want to sell ice cream off a truck in the summer. I want to park it in front of the soda shop. I want to ring the bell on it every day at noon, but the only place I can park it is the space that's partly in front of Luke's diner."
"LORELAI: So?"
"TAYLOR: You have pull with Luke."
"LORELAI: I guess, maybe."
"TAYLOR: You're friends."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"TAYLOR: You can get him to agree to this."
"LORELAI: Use my pull."
"TAYLOR: If you don't mind."
"LORELAI: So if I get Luke to agree to this, the madness stops?"
"TAYLOR: If that's what you want to call it."
"LORELAI: The work begins and the porch goes?"
"TAYLOR: All expedited, nice and neat."
"LORELAI: An ice-cream truck?"
"TAYLOR: An ice-cream truck."
"LORELAI: You can go."
"TAYLOR: Well, this has been a very successful outing. Back on the bus, everyone."
"MICHEL: Unbelievable."
"SOOKIE: Yup. Hey, when do you think you'll. . .[Lorelai walks away] Shortcut to Luke's."
"MICHEL: How is she going to get over Potter's Creek?"
"SOOKIE: Jump it?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai rushes in, out of breath]"
"LORELAI: Give him his ice-cream truck."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: I forged a stream and I almost got attacked by a beaver, and I'm not leaving here till you agree."
"LUKE: To what?"
"LORELAI: You don't own the street, you own the building. It's a public street. Just let him park his stupid truck."
"LUKE: I'm missing something here."
"LORELAI: Don't change the subject."
"LUKE: I don't even know what the subject is."
"LORELAI: If you let Taylor park his stupid ringy-dingy ice-cream truck - not even in front of the diner, but in front of part of the diner - then I can start work on the inn. But if you don't say yes, then you may not have to see his truck parked outside, but you will have to see my body swinging from that tree over there because I will hang myself. I am waiting for your answer."
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: Sure what?"
"LUKE: He can park it there. What do I care?"
"LORELAI: Oh, don't kid around here."
"LUKE: Your life's at stake. I wouldn't kid around."
"LORELAI: That easy?"
"LUKE: That easy."
"LORELAI: Well, why'd you say no before?"
"LUKE: When?"
"LORELAI: When Taylor asked you before?"
"LUKE: He never asked me before."
"LORELAI: He never asked?"
"LUKE: Not about a truck - about a giant ice cream cone a few months back. I said no to that. Probably why he thought I'd say no to the truck."
"LORELAI: He never asked?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: But you're fine with this, and he could have asked?"
"LUKE: It's a public street."
"LORELAI: And you would have said yes?"
"LUKE: I'd have said yes."
"LORELAI: And I wouldn't have had to go through all this."
"LUKE: Probably not."
"LORELAI: You know what, I've learned something very valuable here today. Come on in. Sit down there. Take a load off. Very valuable."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: I've had a business epiphany. It's like I'm Bud Fox, saying, ""Thanks for the lesson, Mr. Gekko."""
"LUKE: This will pass, folks."
"LORELAI: The Lorelai you knew is dead. Remember her? The eager to please, fresh of face? She thought that success in business meant working hard, applying yourself, and respecting your coworkers, and she preached that to others - oh, little child."
"LUKE: You should probably get some rest."
"LORELAI: It's about scratching backs, my friend, and kissing things - I won't be graphic."
"LUKE: It is Sunday morning."
"LORELAI: It's dirty, that's what business is. It's smoke-filled back rooms with exposed pipes and shady players chewing on fat cigars and twirling their dirty mustaches. And when you go into those rooms, you can't be a milquetoast muppet. You have to have pointy teeth and jaws that snap. The meek shall not inherit the earth!"
"LUKE: Thanks for the perspective."
"LORELAI: Do you have any coffee?"
"LUKE: I'm not giving you coffee."
"LORELAI: I don't have time for coffee. I gotta go find Taylor and close this deal. You think he's back at the store?"
"LUKE: Or having his dirty mustache cleaned."
"LORELAI: You're good with the truck?"
"LUKE: I'm good with the truck."
"LORELAI: Bless you. [leaves]"
"LUKE: I'll be right with you, folks."
"[Luke walks upstairs to the apartment. Dean is sitting on the bed]"
"LUKE: So, you're up."
"DEAN: Yeah, I'm up. It took me a minute or two to figure out where I am, but. . ."
"LUKE: Oh, that's right. You've never been here before."
"DEAN: Yeah, it's not that I remembered. I just kinda looked out the window and that's how I could tell."
"LUKE: Good, smart. [hands him a drink] Little concoction of mine - it'll help with the hangover."
"DEAN: Guess I had a beer or two too many last night, huh?"
"LUKE: Yeah, it happens."
"DEAN: Hope the guys didn't bug you too much."
"LUKE: No, they were fine."
"DEAN: Good."
"LUKE: So, you're all dressed there?"
"DEAN: Yeah, uh, you know, big day - getting married."
"LUKE: Getting married."
"DEAN: Um, I'm due in the church in about an hour."
"LUKE: Hey, uh, Dean. . ."
"DEAN: And I still gotta pick up my tux."
"LUKE: Yeah, right."
"DEAN: Um, thanks for everything, Luke."
"LUKE: Yeah, sure. Good luck."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"RORY: So, a total strikeout, huh?"
"LANE: Total. And, you know, at first, I felt bad for them - so lacking in talent, yet so clueless. Then I just felt bad for their guitars."
"RORY: Where are all the good young musicians these days?"
"LANE: My ears wanted to fly off my head. I'm going to the music store to look at things I can't afford. Want to come?"
"RORY: I have to go get ready for this."
"LANE: Right. Tell me how it goes."
"RORY: I will."
"[Lane walks away. Luke walks out of the market]"
"RORY: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Hey, Rory. Um, where's your mom?"
"RORY: Uh, around somewhere. Why?"
"LUKE: I thought I'd find her at Doose's. Did she go back to the inn, or. . ."
"RORY: She was going back to the inn, then she was picking up a wedding present for Dean from us, because she hates it when people send gifts later. And then depending on time, I was either gonna meet her back at home or at the church."
"LUKE: She have her cell on her?"
"RORY: I think it's dead. What's going on?"
"LUKE: Or a pager or something?"
"RORY: Is something wrong?"
"LUKE: Oh, no, I just need to check something with her."
"RORY: Well, we can stop by after the wedding."
"LUKE: Don't go to the wedding."
"RORY: What?"
"LUKE: Uh, don't go to Dean's wedding."
"RORY: Why?"
"LUKE: I just. . .don't go. Trust me."
"RORY: Okay."
"LUKE: It'd just be better this way."
"RORY: Okay."
"LUKE: So, you're not going?"
"RORY: I guess not."
"LUKE: Okay, good. Good. I'll see you guys later."
"RORY: Yeah, Luke, I'll see you later."
"LUKE: Okay."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai walks out of a store. Kirk walks up to her]"
"KIRK: Lorelai, do you have a minute?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure, Kirk."
"KIRK: We've had a successful disconnection."
"LORELAI: No more alarm?"
"KIRK: No more alarm."
"LORELAI: Fantastic."
"KIRK: The roofer will be out tomorrow. The repair should take about a day."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna inquire about that right now."
"KIRK: It's all taken care of, and I want to apologize for any inconvenience."
"LORELAI: Aw, it was no big deal."
"KIRK: I have this strong sense of chivalry when it comes to women living alone."
"LORELAI: That's very nice."
"KIRK: My family tree dates back to a 12th-century knight."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"KIRK: As a kid, I thought that meant we were related to Ted Knight. I wrote him a lot of letters. He never responded."
"LORELAI: That's cute, though."
"KIRK: I just want you to feel safe."
"LORELAI: You really do, don't you, Kirk?"
"KIRK: So, I hope you don't mind my watching out for you."
"LORELAI: Not at all. [she kisses his cheek]"
"KIRK: Thank you. I'll see you around."
"LORELAI: See ya."
"[Kirk walks away as Rory walks over]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Ooh, hey. I think I found the perfect wedding present for Dean. It's sweet, not too personal, classy, yet cheap."
"RORY: We're not going."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Luke was looking for you and ran into me, and he was all nervous and everything, and then he finally just said we shouldn't go."
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: I think it means that we shouldn't go."
"LORELAI: Did he give a reason?"
"RORY: Not really."
"LORELAI: I'll go talk to him."
"RORY: No, Mom, he seemed really serious, and I think that if you saw him you'd feel the same way. He was kind of upset."
"LORELAI: About Dean's wedding?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: So, we're not going?"
"RORY: I think it's better that we don't."
"LORELAI: Okay. Mystery, though."
"RORY: Kind of."
"LORELAI: Well, you've got your nothing-to-do weekend back."
"RORY: Yeah, got that back. Um, Mom, Kirk's following us in a little clowny car."
"LORELAI: He's watching out for us."
"RORY: Okay."
"CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are standing on the porch with sledgehammers as Michel gets ready to take a picture]"
"MICHEL: Ready?"
"LORELAI: No, no, it's gotta look like we're actually demolishing the porch."
"SOOKIE: We're gonna do pretend swings."
"LORELAI: Which would have been easier if we had pretend sledgehammers."
"SOOKIE: Why do they make these so heavy?"
"MICHEL: Well, even without the swing, this is a good picture of the two of you about to record an important moment for the two of you."
"LORELAI: Um, Michel -"
"MICHEL: I would love a copy of this for my mantel, such a nice moment."
"LORELAI: You have to be in the picture, too, Michel."
"MICHEL: Me? I don't know. All right."
"SOOKIE: That thing have a timer on it?"
"MICHEL: It's set. I framed the sh*t. Grab your hammer and smile."
"[they pose for the picture]"
"LORELAI: One more for safety?"
"MICHEL: Okay."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Just sometimes, it hits me. This place had a long history before us, has a long future after us. I keep thinking it's apart of our lives, but, really, it's the reverse. For a little while. . .I don't know. . .it's like we're apart of its life."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"[The three of them pose for another picture]"
"CUT TO THE TOWN SQUARE"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting out front on the grass when Rory pulls up]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Well, I'm gardening."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm gardening."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Why don't you come over here and see, honey, since you seem so confused?"
"RORY: Oh, my God. You are gardening."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Hello. I am gardening."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because Babette bought me a bag of bulbs."
"RORY: Why would she do that?"
"LORELAI: She thought that cultivating new life would help distract me from my current emptiness and sense of loss."
"RORY: Huh. Well, that's weirdly sweet of her."
"LORELAI: Yes, it was. Anyhow, I forgot about the bulbs 'til Babette brought them up this morning, so I dug them out of the garage."
"RORY: Ew!"
"LORELAI: Where they've developed some sort of mold."
"RORY: This is the planet of the mold."
"LORELAI: Help me."
"RORY: Mom, I'm no botanist, but I don't think anything's gonna grow from this piece of tar."
"LORELAI: Just put it in the hole and cover it up."
"RORY: Why didn't you just throw them out?"
"LORELAI: There are eyes everywhere, my dear."
"BABETTE: [calls from her front porch] Hey, doll, how you doing?"
"LORELAI: Great, Babette. Just tending my bulbs."
"BABETTE: Makes you feel better, doesn't it?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely - much better."
"BABETTE: You need any help?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no. I got Rory helping me."
"RORY: Hi, Babette."
"BABETTE: Hi, sugar. Don't worry, I'm looking out for your mom."
"RORY: I'm glad to hear that."
"BABETTE: Oh, and just you wait 'til spring. You're gonna wake up one morning, walk out, and pow - color coming out of your yin-yang! I'll see you girls tomorrow. [goes into her house]"
"LORELAI: I'm going to have color coming out of my yin-yang."
"RORY: Well, then maybe you'll finally get a man. This has got to be the grossest thing ever."
"LORELAI: Forget about the bulbs. Let's talk about something else. How's school?"
"RORY: School's fine. It's hard but good. Tanna's fine. Janet and Paris are fighting because Janet gets up at 5:30 to go jogging, wakes Paris up, and then the resulting argument wakes everybody up, and - oh! [screams and tosses a dirty bulb at Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: [screams] Oh, my God! You bulbed me! You bulbed me!"
"RORY: I was aiming over there."
"LORELAI: Oh, it got my hand! It got my hand!"
"RORY: Shake it off. Shake it off."
"LORELAI: Oh, it won't go! It won't go!"
"RORY: Aah! You wiped it on my shirt."
"LORELAI: It was a reflex."
"RORY: To ruin my shirt?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"RORY: You never liked this shirt."
"LORELAI: It's not that. It's just that -"
"RORY: Aah! There's something crawling up my leg!"
"LORELAI: Oh no, oh no! I got it, I got it."
"RORY: There's something crawling up my leg!"
"LORELAI: I got it, I got it! Ew! It's big! Ew!"
"RORY: Okay, so the next time that Babette gives you a bag of bulbs to plant because you're lonely, you say. . ."
"LORELAI: No, thank you."
"RORY: Class dismissed."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is asleep in her bedroom]"
"PARIS: [overheard from common room] You could at least open a window."
"JANET: Why?"
"PARIS: Because it smells like a locker room in here!"
"JANET: Tough luck!"
"PARIS: Fine!"
"[Paris walks into the bedroom]"
"RORY: Did the alarm go off?"
"PARIS: I shut it off. Who needs an alarm when you've got Workout Barbie around? Never mind that some of us were up finishing a chem lab 'til 2:30 in the morning! I for one love waking up at five a.m. to the sound of someone grunting out crunches in the common room!"
"RORY: I told you - earplugs."
"PARIS: You know, she talks to herself when she stretches. ""Come on, Janet. Push it, Janet. Love the pain, Janet."" It's pornographic."
"RORY: What time is it?"
"PARIS: I know what she's doing. It's psychological warfare. Don't let your enemy sleep. Push him 'til he cracks. Charlie tried the same tricks on our boys at Khe Sanh, and let me tell you, if she keeps this up, I am not gonna be responsible for what happens."
"RORY: Oh, my God! Paris, breakfast is over in five minutes!"
"PARIS: I know. It's Tuesday, too. That's waffle bar day."
"RORY: Why didn't you wake me?"
"PARIS: Oh, sure, blame me. I'm the victim here, remember?"
"CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA"
"[Rory rushes in wearing her pajamas and a robe]"
"RORY: Excuse me, excuse me. Can I. . .[she grabs the last waffle from a tray before the kitchen worker throws it out] Yes, thank you."
"MARTY: Rory."
"RORY: Marty."
"MARTY: You remembered."
"RORY: Well, I wasn't the one passed out in the hallway, so I had a better sh*t."
"MARTY: True, very true. So, I see you're a little late for breakfast."
"RORY: Yeah. My alarm was turned off."
"MARTY: Well, hey, you want some eggs or something? I always take enough for ten. I blame my brother. He always took the biggest piece of chicken."
"RORY: And left you none?"
"MARTY: No, there was plenty more. I just really wanted that big piece."
"RORY: Oh. Well -"
"MARTY: Hey, I want you to meet The Breakfast Crew."
"RORY: Oh, well, I'm kind of -"
"MARTY: Well, we all just started eating breakfast together every morning, so someone came up with the name The Breakfast Crew. I mean, it's not like an official club or anything. There's no hats. At least not until we can all agree on a color. Uh, excuse me, guys. I want you all to meet Rory."
"GUY 1: Who?"
"MARTY: The robe."
"GUY 1: Oh, the robe. Nice to meet you."
"MARTY: I told them about your act of kindness."
"RORY: Oh, it was nothing, really."
"GUY 1: I wouldn't say that. That was one nice robe."
"GUY 2: We all took turns trying it on."
"MARTY: Uh, not true. Ignore him. I'm sorry I haven't gotten it back to you yet."
"RORY: Oh, it's okay."
"GUY 3: Nice bunny shoes."
"RORY: Thank you. Uh, well, it was nice meeting you all. I actually have to go, so - [walks away]"
"MARTY: [follows her] I embarrassed you."
"RORY: It's fine."
"MARTY: I'm sorry. I was just so relieved that I could finally approach you."
"RORY: Why couldn't you approach me?"
"MARTY: Well, that night was really humiliating, so every time I saw you after that, I just hid. But then when I saw you show up this morning like that, I thought, here's my chance to even the playing field."
"RORY: Marty, this is not as embarrassing as being totally naked."
"MARTY: No, it's not. But it's close"
"RORY: Um, well, consider the playing field leveled."
"MARTY: Good. Uh, see ya, Rory."
"RORY: See ya, Marty."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is talking on her cell phone. While she talks, Luke tries to get her to take it outside. She walks slowly and lingers by the door]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Exactly, yes, that's just the kind of thing we're looking for. Well, I'm so glad to hear that because the last three designers we met with had very different philosophies. Uh-huh. No, I didn't know you did the Silver Thatch Inn. Oh, that was so beautiful. Yeah. Okay. Well, why don't we, uh, meet, uh, Friday, say, around two o'clock? Okay. Luke's Diner. It's right in the middle of the town square. You can't miss it. Just follow the love. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. [hangs up]"
"LUKE: What was that?"
"LORELAI: I was taking it outside."
"LUKE: Three people came in while you held the door open."
"LORELAI: You're exaggerating."
"LUKE: Why can't you respect the rules of my diner?"
"LORELAI: I do respect the rules of your diner. It's that baseball cap I have issues with."
"[Michel walks in and sits down]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MICHEL: Hey. All right, I've done extensive research, checked references, and prescreened three other designers for you. Here are their names."
"LORELAI: Well, hopefully I won't need these. I think I just found a new designer for the inn."
"MICHEL: Well, good. I love doing research just for the sake of doing research. I live to grow. Are you still buying me lunch?"
"LORELAI: I'd be happy to buy you lunch, but I should probably take you somewhere else."
"LUKE: Why should you take him somewhere else?"
"LORELAI: Because, Kook Danes, Michel eats a very specific diet."
"MICHEL: Normally, yes, that's true. However, every six months I give myself a crazy day where I can eat anything I want, and today's crazy day. Talk to me about your chocolate cake."
"LUKE: What do you want to know?"
"MICHEL: Is it Mexican?"
"LUKE: Is what Mexican?"
"MICHEL: The chocolate."
"LUKE: How would I know?"
"MICHEL: It would say so on the wrapper. You could go look. I'll wait."
"LUKE: Take him somewhere else."
"MICHEL: Oh, just bring me a doughnut, but put some sprinkles on it, okay?"
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello?"
"EMILY: Do you know what one of life's great mysteries is?"
"LORELAI: Uh, Mom. . ."
"EMILY: Whether or not you're going to be joining us for Friday night dinner."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"EMILY: And since you pretend to be ignorant of the concept of the RSVP even though I know it was taught to you as a child, I am reduced to calling and asking you, are you coming?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"EMILY: Is that ""uh huh, yes, I'm coming"" or ""uh huh, I was reading while you were talking""?"
"LORELAI: Um, tell you what, Mom - plan on me coming, and if I don't, then it'll just be a little more for everyone else."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you know very well our dinners do not work like that. There is careful planning and shopping and preparation that goes into every meal no matter how boring and simple it may seem to you."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom -"
"[Lorelai throws something at Luke to get his attention.]"
"LUKE: Hey, what. . .get off that phone!"
"LORELAI: Oh, sh**t, Mom, there's no cell phones in here. I'll call you back later. Bye. [hangs up] And when I need you - nowhere."
"CUT TO YALE CLASSROOM"
"[Rory is in her English class]"
"HEATHER: It's obvious Hemingway is just using Jake's impotence to indict a society which exploited its underclass to fight in the trenches of the first World w*r."
"PROFESSOR: Interesting theory, Heather. What does everyone else think?"
"RORY: I don't know. I mean, isn't Jake's impotence more about that generation's loss of faith in love?"
"HEATHER: Ugh, please. That grossly ignores the social context."
"TREVOR: Rory's right. The book's about a guy who can't sleep with the woman he loves. It's not some Woody Guthrie song."
"HEATHER: But -"
"PROFERSSOR: Okay, hold that thought, Heather. We're out of time. Okay, everyone, we'll continue this Thursday. I'll see you all then."
"RORY: Thanks for the save."
"TREVOR: No problem. Heather can get a little ""workers of the world, unite"" sometimes."
"RORY: Yeah, I've never actually met someone who likes the word bourgeois so much."
"TREVOR: So, what are you up to this weekend?"
"RORY: Oh, studying. Sleep, hopefully. A rarity in my dorm room."
"TREVOR: Yeah? Do you eat?"
"RORY: Habitually."
"TREVOR: Ever been to Pancia di Lucca? I hear it's good."
"RORY: Uh, no, I haven't."
"TREVOR: Well, I was thinking of going there this weekend."
"RORY: Oh, cool. Tell me how it is."
"TREVOR: Okay, I will. Or, hey, you could come with me."
"RORY: I can't this Saturday, but if it's good, maybe another time, okay?"
"TREVOR: Sure, okay. So, see you next week."
"RORY: Bye, Trevor."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks into the house carrying a laundry basket]"
"LORELAI: Hey, what are you doing home?"
"RORY: Well, it seems that if you leave your laundry in the machine for even two minutes after it stops, some incredibly impatient person will come and take your nice clean clothes out and dump them."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: Anywhere. The floor, the top of another dirty washing machine. My Belle and Sebastian t-shirt was in the garbage. So now, on top of a massive amount of reading and studying, I get to rewash my formerly perfect clean clothes."
"LORELAI: Well, that's just wrong. I think you should quit school in protest."
"RORY: Okay, if you say so."
"[Rory reaches for a slice of pizza from the coffee table]"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, wait. That's not ours."
"RORY: What do you mean it's not ours? Who's it for?"
"[Lane rushes into the house]"
"LANE: I've got five minutes. Where's the pizza?"
"LORELAI: Uh, there."
"LANE: Thanks. Hi, Rory."
"RORY: Hey, Lane."
"LANE: My mom ordered all the okra in the Western Hemisphere. She got a great deal and I'm starving to death."
"RORY: Swallow."
"LANE: Between Seventh Day Adventist college and my mom's new fascination with ordering on the internet, my future looks very grim."
"RORY: You want a Coke?"
"LANE: No, no time for liquids. I have to be home for dinner in four minutes. Another piece, please? Okay, great. Okay, this is good. You all look good. Things are good?"
"RORY: Things are -"
"LANE: Okay, gotta go. Thanks for the grub. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: She is so throwing up on the way home."
"RORY: I'm gonna go put this stuff in the washer."
"LORELAI: Wait, wait, have some pizza and tell Mama all about your day."
"RORY: Okay. Oh, yesterday Janet woke up to find that Paris had chaired her in her room."
"LORELAI: Oh, nice."
"RORY: And then, later, when Janet had climbed out the window, she retaliated by gluing shut the opening of Paris' glue g*n."
"LORELAI: Wow, she went for the crafts."
"RORY: This w*r is getting totally out of hand. This morning Paris turned off my alarm because Janet woke her up. I almost missed breakfast. I ran down to the dining hall in my pajamas and bunny slippers, and of course I ran into Marty."
"LORELAI: Naked guy."
"RORY: It was totally humiliating."
"LORELAI: Humiliating 'cause naked guy's hot?"
"RORY: It was humiliating because I had terrycloth rabbits on my feet."
"LORELAI: So naked guy's not hot?"
"RORY: Naked guy is Marty, and it's not like that. He's sweet."
"LORELAI: Ah. Sweet means bad butt."
"RORY: Sweet does not mean bad butt. Sweet means sweet."
"LORELAI: Poor naked guy. He should've left his clothes on."
"RORY: Okay, you have got to stop talking about naked guy. I just met Marty."
"LORELAI: All right. If not him, are there any other guys on the horizon?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: No? How about a professor - someone older, wiser, with brown cords and whiskey breath?"
"RORY: Oh, well, yeah. There's one of those."
"LORELAI: Come on, Rory."
"RORY: Well, this guy asked me to go try this restaurant this weekend, but it was a totally casual thing."
"LORELAI: So what'd you tell him?"
"RORY: That I was busy."
"LORELAI: You don't like him?"
"RORY: No, I like him fine. I mean, he's smart, and he takes my side in the debates, and he's decent to look at."
"LORELAI: So, why'd you say no? Too many clothes?"
"RORY: I don't know. He. . .he carries a bottle of water around with him all the time. That's just weird."
"LORELAI: Right. Hydration. Very creepy."
"RORY: And he's preppy, and I don't really like preppy. Plus, he's gonna go study in Barcelona next year."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: So it's a waste of time. It can't go anywhere."
"LORELAI: It could go to dinner, maybe a movie."
"RORY: Mom. . ."
"LORELAI: No, look, Rory, I know you've never really dated."
"RORY: What are you talking about? I've dated."
"LORELAI: Who did you date?"
"RORY: Dean."
"LORELAI: You and Dean did not date. You had a relationship."
"RORY: Well, Jess."
"LORELAI: Was relationship number two."
"RORY: So maybe I've never dated, but you haven't either."
"LORELAI: I have dated at least once."
"RORY: Mmhmm. You had me with dad - relationship."
"LORELAI: Yes, but -"
"RORY: Max - relationship. Dad again - relationship."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine, I may not be the world's best dater, but I do it and you should give it a sh*t. I mean, you're in college now. What else is there to do in college but date?"
"RORY: I'm gonna go wash my clothes now."
"LORELAI: Wait. Was that it? Is this conversation over? Sorry, did I win?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and the decorator have books spread out on several tables around them]"
"NATALIE: Okay, here, I wanted to show you this."
"LORELAI: Castles of Ireland?"
"NATALIE: There is a room in here that I've always wanted to do. Here it is."
"LORELAI: Oh, I love that. What is that wall treatment?"
"NATALIE: That's anaglypta wallpaper."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm looking at anaglypta wallpaper."
"LUKE: And the other three tables are here for support?"
"LORELAI: Well, we just had a lot of books to go through. Uh, Luke, this is Natalie Zimmerman. Natalie's gonna help us design the Dragonfly."
"NATALIE: Nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Did I tell you we're gonna have horses?"
"NATALIE: The property already has stables, so why not?"
"LORELAI: I love horses. I've always loved horses ever since I was a little girl, and now I finally have a grown-up excuse to buy a pony."
"LUKE: Great. Listen, National Velvet, you have to move this stuff out of here."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: Because this is a diner. People wanna sit."
"LORELAI: This is business."
"LUKE: No, this is business, and it's open, and it's decorated, and it wants its seats back."
"LORELAI: Fine. Sorry about that. He's trying to steal the ""World's Grumpiest Diner Guy"" title from Mel."
"NATALIE: No problem."
"LORELAI: So you were telling me about anaglypta wallpaper?"
"NATALIE: Yes, it's a textured paper that we can paint or treat. We can even distress it if you want to give it a more, you know, vintage-y look."
"LORELAI: Hm, that sounds interesting."
"NATALIE: You know, Emily actually has some in the smaller upstairs guest bath. You should take a look at it the next time you're there."
"LORELAI: Um, Emily? You mean like my mother, Emily?"
"NATALIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: I didn't know you knew Emily."
"NATALIE: Oh, yeah. I did her second-floor remodel about a year ago. I thought that's how you got my name."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I, uh, got your name from a magazine. So you know Emily?"
"NATALIE: It's a small world, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yes, yes, really small. About the same square footage as that box they threw McCain in."
"NATALIE: So, are you ready to see bedrooms?"
"LORELAI: Yes, sure. Why not?"
"CUT TO YALE CLASSROOM"
"[Rory is in her English class]"
"PROFESSOR: Next week we finish up with ""Snows of Kilimanjaro"", then it is Hemingway's pal Scott Fitzgerald, so do yourselves a favor - get a jump on ""Tender is the Night."""
"RORY: Wow. Good session today, huh?"
"TREVOR: It was fine."
"RORY: I can't believe we sit around and talk about books and get graded on it. I mean, there's almost nothing I like more than talking about a good book or a bad book or a really thick magazine."
"TREVOR: Mmhmm."
"RORY: Hey, Trevor. You know what else I like to do besides talk about a really good book? Eat. Isn't that weird? And, actually, for me, they're linked. It's true. When I talk about a book, I get really hungry - starving. You ever experience that?"
"TREVOR: Not really."
"RORY: Oh. Well, it happens to me all the time. Like right now, for example, starving, really. And I enjoyed ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"" so much that I will probably be hungry for quite some time. All weekend, probably. Especially Saturday night."
"TREVOR: Saturday night?"
"RORY: Saturday night."
"TREVOR: Are you saying you want to go to dinner on Saturday night?"
"RORY: Wow. Um, okay. Yeah. Well, I will be hungry."
"TREVOR: Well, that fact has been pretty well established."
"RORY: Okay. Sure. Yeah, let's go to dinner Saturday night."
"TREVOR: So, you're at -"
"RORY: Durfee, suite 5."
"TREVOR: I'll pick you up at 7:30."
"RORY: Sounds good."
"TREVOR: Okay."
"RORY: Wow. I gotta hand it to you there, Trevor. You sure are persistent."
"CUT TO THE TOWN SQUARE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk down the street]"
"LORELAI: Davey? You're naming him Davey?"
"SOOKIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: I love Davey."
"SOOKIE: Me, too."
"LORELAI: Oh, I can't believe you finally picked a name. It makes it real."
"SOOKIE: Yes, because the stomach and massive ankles were too ambiguous."
"LORELAI: Does Jackson like it?"
"SOOKIE: Uh, well, he's okay with the stomach, but the massive ankles freak him out."
"LORELAI: The name Davey."
"SOOKIE: It was actually his suggestion."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"SOOKIE: He wanted Davey if it was a boy and Colgate if it was a girl."
"LORELAI: Colgate?"
"SOOKIE: His great-grandmother's name."
"LORELAI: Great-grandmother Colgate."
"SOOKIE: Yup."
"LORELAI: That's horrible."
"SOOKIE: You know what's worse, she looked like a Colgate."
"LORELAI: Well, at least you know it's gonna be a boy."
"SOOKIE: Yes, but he doesn't know it's going to be a boy. And I realized he has to know that I thought Colgate was an insane name, but if I didn't fight him on it, it must be because I knew we weren't gonna have a girl and then he would know we were gonna have a boy, and that would spoil everything for him. So I told him, ""We are not naming our daughter after a toothpaste!"" We got in a big fight and we're not talking."
"LORELAI: Cool!"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, I know. Everything's perfect. My baby has a name and my husband's sleeping on the couch. Oh, and I figured out that I'll go with the Avery stove for the inn. Is that okay? Because I know it's a little more expensive."
"LORELAI: It's your kitchen, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Okay, good. I'm gonna call Natalie the minute I get home."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"SOOKIE: What's wrong?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"SOOKIE: It's the Avery. It's too extravagant."
"LORELAI: No, the Avery's fine. Everything's fine."
"SOOKIE: You're sure?"
"LORELAI: I'm sure. Just. . .Natalie knows my mother."
"SOOKIE: Emily? How?"
"LORELAI: Yes, because she did her second-floor remodel like a year ago."
"SOOKIE: Oh, so she really knows your mother."
"LORELAI: They've been shopping together. It's a bond. Sookie, I don't know if I -"
"SOOKIE: Lorelai, no."
"LORELAI: She knows my mother."
"SOOKIE: So what?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, my whole life, my whole existence, my essence, my being, my ability to be this sparkling creature standing here before you -- all of this depends on the complete and total separation of my life from my mother's life. That's how it works."
"SOOKIE: But we like Natalie."
"LORELAI: We do like Natalie."
"SOOKIE: Remember all the other designers we met that we didn't like before Natalie? Remember the one that wanted to put the tiny mannequin in every room so that the lonely people would have someone to talk to?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I do."
"SOOKIE: Or the purple, purple, purple guy."
"LORELAI: Purple, purple, purple."
"SOOKIE: They were horrible. And then we met Natalie, and she was perfect. Look, just try. At least give Natalie a chance, okay? Please?"
"LORELAI: I'll try."
"SOOKIE: Good. I'm gonna go home and get going on the Avery."
"LORELAI: All right. I have to stop by Luke's. I'll call you later."
"SOOKIE: Okay. It's going to be fine."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke. What's going on?"
"LUKE: Oh, well. . .Tom called. The banister on the stairs has to be replaced. It'll be $4,000. Tamsin Cordally called. He needs a deposit on the quartersawn oak. It'll be $4,000. Julio the landscaper called. I have no idea what he said, but it's going to be $4,000. Vicki from Vicki's Horse Supply called. She thinks Pepper and g*n would suit your needs, but g*n snores, so the stables can't be too close to the guests' bedrooms. Rory's looking for her black Converse, and, oh, one last thing - I'm not taking messages for you anymore!"
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"LUKE: What did you do, have business cards printed up?"
"LORELAI: People just know I'm here a lot."
"LUKE: I missed a call from my meat guy because I was on the phone discussing g*n's deviated septum."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna call all these people today and tell them never to call me here again."
"LUKE: You bet you will."
"LORELAI: Consider it done."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: Just -"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Just, uh, one more thing. Did a package arrive for me here today?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. Never mind, never mind."
"ED: Luke. Sorry. I'm cutting it kind of close here."
"LUKE: Oh, sorry, Ed. I didn't realize you were cutting it kind of close. Everybody, drop everything. Ed's cutting it kind of close. Here's your tickets."
"ED: You seem mad."
"LUKE: Look, Ed, just go to the game and enjoy it, okay? Choke on a hot dog while you're at it."
"ED: I have to tell you, Luke, I am never accepting anything free from you again."
"LUKE: What a threat! Boy, you're a real master of fear, there, Ed. Look out, Jason and Freddy. Ed may never mooch off of either one of you ever again!"
"LORELAI: What is wrong with you?"
"LUKE: Nothing."
"LORELAI: You're yelling at Ed."
"LUKE: Ah, Ed bugs me."
"LORELAI: Ed cries."
"LUKE: I'm just having a bad day."
"LORELAI: Zzz."
"LUKE: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Days. You've been stomping around, barking at people for days."
"LUKE: I have not."
"LORELAI: Yes, Cujo, you have."
"LUKE: I always talk to people like that."
"LORELAI: No, Benji, you don't."
"LUKE: I'll be fine tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Really, Lassie? Why is that?"
"LUKE: Look, I bought these tickets for Nicole 'cause she's a Yankees fan. I thought it'd be nice if we went to a game together."
"LORELAI: Oh, man."
"LUKE: And it's no big deal. I mean, the closer it got to the game, the more I felt like a loser. I mean, I'm sitting on these tickets, which means I thought I'd still be in a relationship. I don't know. Stupid. I broke my own rule. I asked for it."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"LUKE: Never plan for anything more than two days in advance."
"LORELAI: That's your rule?"
"LUKE: Yes, 'cause when you make plans, then you have expectations, and when you have expectations, then you will get disappointed."
"LORELAI: Having expectations also gives you something to look forward to."
"LUKE: Yes, then you're looking forward to being constantly disappointed."
"LORELAI: You're not that cynical."
"LUKE: I am today."
"LORELAI: Hey, I have an idea. Tomorrow night is usually movie night."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Rory and I would always rent a bunch of movies, order food -- it was our thing. Now she's at school and busy, so why don't you come over? It might be fun."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"LUKE: Sure, what else have I got to do?"
"LORELAI: Ah, I love when men say that to me."
"LUKE: What time?"
"LORELAI: Eight."
"LUKE: Eight it is."
"LORELAI: I'll stop by the video store and pick us up a couple movies. What do you want to see?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Well, come on, tell me. I don't want to get something you've seen."
"LUKE: Don't worry about it. I haven't seen anything."
"LORELAI: People always say that."
"LUKE: Well, with me, it's true."
"LORELAI: ""Casablanca""?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: You have never seen ""Casablanca""? Are you kidding?"
"LUKE: Just get anything, please."
"LORELAI: ""Chinatown""?"
"LUKE: Anything at all."
"LORELAI: ""Bonnie and Clyde""?"
"LUKE: A video game would be nice also."
"LORELAI: ""It Happened One Night""? ""His Girl Friday""? ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre""? ""Diner""?"
"LUKE: I saw ""Mr. and Mrs. Bridge."""
"LORELAI: Oh. My house, eight o'clock. We have such work to do."
"LUKE: I'll see you there."
"LORELAI: Oh, by the way, if my package arrives today, bring it with you, okay? Thanks."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings. The maid answers the door and lets Lorelai in]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. Uh, oh, oh, hold on, whoa. Wow, that could have been very ugly, huh? The great cappuccino disaster of 2003. Very sad -- Shelley Winters drowns. Think the coffee was stronger than I thought."
"MAID: Can I take your coat?"
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"MAID: Your daughter called and said she was gonna be late. Her class ran long."
"LORELAI: Oh, so Rory's not here yet?"
"MAID: No, it's just you and your mother."
"LORELAI: Huh. Hey. Oh, gosh. You know what? I just remembered I left something in the car, so I'll be right back. Could I - just - it's new. I can't be away from it just yet. Oh, thanks. Okay. Back in a flash."
"[Lorelai goes outside to her car and turns on the radio. She starts dancing and mouthing the words to ""Shadow Dancing."" Emily knocks on the car door and startles Lorelai, who screams. She opens the window]"
"EMILY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I was looking for my lip gloss."
"EMILY: You need the radio on to look for your lip gloss?"
"LORELAI: Well, uh, I came out here and I couldn't find it and so I thought maybe if I tried to retrace my steps, it would turn up."
"EMILY: Very clever idea."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I thought so. So I put my purse on the seat and I put the keys in the car, and naturally the radio came on 'cause that's what it does, and, uh, ""Shadow Dancing"" was playing, which was one of my all time favorite songs in junior high."
"EMILY: And you forgot to look for your lip gloss."
"LORELAI: Just for a second."
"EMILY: Which makes sense since it's in the ashtray right next to you."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. It is. Look at that."
"EMILY: Yes, it's a miracle. Come inside, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, can't I just wait 'til the song. . .I'm coming."
"[they walk into the house]"
"EMILY: You can't sit here for three seconds without Rory."
"LORELAI: Not true."
"EMILY: Oh, stop it and sit down. I want to talk to you about something. I just found out that Sookie is pregnant."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. Don't look at me, I had nothing to do with it."
"EMILY: May I ask why you didn't bother to tell me?"
"LORELAI: Uh, well. . ."
"EMILY: Lorelai, your not telling me about Sookie is unforgivable."
"LORELAI: Why, it's not like you're such good friends."
"EMILY: I went to her wedding."
"LORELAI: So did Kirk."
"EMILY: I haven't sent her a gift, Lorelai. How does that make me look?"
"LORELAI: Like you hate her and all childbearing women."
"EMILY: You are so intent on keeping me out of your life."
"LORELAI: It's not even my life. It's Sookie's life."
"EMILY: A simple phone call to tell me that Sookie is pregnant."
"LORELAI: How did you find out about it, anyway?"
"EMILY: Why, are you going to track down the informant and have him sh*t?"
"LORELAI: Maybe."
"EMILY: It doesn't matter how I found out. I found out, no thanks to you."
"LORELAI: Mom, please, just tell me how you found out."
"EMILY: Why? Does it bother you not knowing?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: Me, too."
"[Rory comes in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"EMILY: Rory, you're here."
"RORY: I'm so sorry I'm late, Grandma. Hi, Mom."
"LORELAI: You'll pay."
"EMILY: So come on, sit down and tell me all about Yale."
"LORELAI: If you don't, she'll find out anyway."
"RORY: Yale's interesting. It's a lot more free-form than I thought."
"EMILY: Well, you're an adult now. They treat you like an adult in college."
"LORELAI: In college, yes. In the Gilmore house. . ."
"EMILY: We've switched subjects, in case you were wondering. So tell me, what are your plans for the weekend? Any parties going on?"
"RORY: Well, yeah, there are always parties going on, but I'm not going to a party this weekend. I'm actually going on a date."
"LORELAI: You are?"
"EMILY: Well, your first college date."
"LORELAI: Who's the lucky guy?"
"RORY: Just a guy from my English class."
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Your English class."
"LORELAI: What happened? I thought you turned him down."
"EMILY: You turned him down?"
"RORY: I know, but I thought about it and I reconsidered."
"LORELAI: What did you do? Did you ask him out?"
"EMILY: You asked him out? Oh, Rory, tell me you didn't ask a boy out."
"RORY: I didn't ask him out. I just made sure he knew I was available."
"LORELAI: Better, Mom?"
"EMILY: No, that's not better. Rory, you're in Yale, not Amsterdam. How you conduct yourself socially is as important as how you conduct yourself academically."
"RORY: I promise, it was very proper."
"LORELAI: Yes, Mom, she had a nice Tiffany lampshade over her red light."
"EMILY: What do you know about this boy? Do you know where he's from, who his parents are?"
"RORY: No, I plan to find that out on the date."
"LORELAI: What are you gonna wear?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Do you want to borrow something of mine?"
"EMILY: No, she does not."
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"EMILY: It's bad enough that you haven't taught your daughter how to interact with the opposite sex. You will not dress her up in one of your ""Sex and the City"" ensembles and send her out to tell the entire campus, ""Don't worry. I'll ask you."""
"LORELAI: How do you know about ""Sex and the City""?"
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lorelai, Sookie, and Natalie are browsing the store]"
"NATALIE: Okay, see, something like this outside against a wall - very ""Little House on the Prairie"" with a twist."
"SOOKIE: I love ""Little House on the Prairie."" Jack the dog. Where is Lindsay Sidney Greenbush? When she came tumbling down the hill, I would just laugh."
"NATALIE: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"NATALIE: Well, what do you think?"
"LORELAI: Hm, I don't know. I'm not really sure."
"NATALIE: Okay. Well, just keep in mind that anything you see here I can have duplicated. I've got this guy in Delaware that can knock off anything for about half the price."
"LORELAI: Maybe we should go."
"SOOKIE: What? We just got started."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe we should think a little more before we shop."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about? We've been thinking for months. Let's start buying! Holy mother of God, this bench is $15,000."
"NATALIE: We can find something else."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, we don't have to find something else."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: We have absolutely no problem paying full price for that bench."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. No money problems or problems of any kind. Our entire lives are perfect. We have no complaints and plenty of money."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about?"
"NATALIE: You know what, I see a lawn jockey out there that looks very interesting. I'll be back. [leaves]"
"SOOKIE: We cannot afford that bench."
"LORELAI: Oh, I know that. I don't want her to know that."
"SOOKIE: Her - Natalie, her?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because it could get back to my mother."
"SOOKIE: What could get back to your mother?"
"LORELAI: That we have money problems."
"SOOKIE: We do have money problems."
"LORELAI: I know, but I don't want my mother knowing that we have money problems. I don't want any personal information leaked out because in Emily's hands, that could be a w*apon."
"SOOKIE: Well, Natalie's not gonna say anything."
"LORELAI: How do you know? How do you know she's not filling my mother in on our every move on a daily basis?"
"SOOKIE: You're being paranoid."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah? My mother found out about you being pregnant."
"SOOKIE: Not from Natalie."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"SOOKIE: Because Natalie herself didn't know until about a half an hour ago."
"LORELAI: That's her story."
"SOOKIE: Okay. This is getting crazy now. You have got to go out there and talk to her about this."
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"SOOKIE: It's the only fair thing. Come on. Go."
"[Lorelai walks outside to Natalie]"
"LORELAI: Hey, um, look, Natalie, I, uh, have to say something to you. I feel a tad silly even mentioning it, but I think I have to."
"NATALIE: Did I do something that -"
"LORELAI: No, no, no, no, you did nothing. You've been great, really. Um, great ideas, great attitude. It's just that. . .you know my mother."
"NATALIE: Yes?"
"LORELAI: That's it. You know my mother."
"NATALIE: Oh."
"LORELAI: And my mother and I don't exactly have the smoothest of relationships."
"NATALIE: Ah."
"LORELAI: Right. I mean, we're not warring or anything, but it's just that we're very different, and I feel kind of weird sharing things with her."
"NATALIE: Look, I promise you, I haven't been in contact with your mother for a long time. Maybe twice she called to get a couple of names, but that was it. I hadn't even met you yet. So trust me -- she knows nothing that you haven't told her yourself."
"LORELAI: Oh. Okay. I feel really stupid right now."
"NATALIE: No, don't. I enjoyed working with your mother, but this inn is the kid of thing that I love to do. And the place has incredible potential and somebody's gonna get a chance to make it a wonderful inn. I would be heartsick if I lost this opportunity."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"NATALIE: Look, I haven't spoken to Emily in months. I doubt I'll be speaking to her in the future. I promise."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"NATALIE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"NATALIE: I'm so glad."
"LORELAI: So am I."
"NATALIE: So now that I talked myself back into a job, what do you think the outlook for this lawn jockey is?"
"LORELAI: Not good."
"NATALIE: Hm. Emily would hate it."
"LORELAI: Wrap it up."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is in her bedroom getting ready for her date]"
"RORY: Okay, so this is option number four. Tanna? Tanna?"
"TANNA: Yeah?"
"RORY: We're doing the whole bonding thing now."
"TANNA: Okay. Sorry. Start again."
"RORY: What do you think?"
"TANNA: Men respond subconsciously to a woman's pheromones. You should run in place 'til he gets here. It'll give you a nice musk."
"RORY: Go back to your leg."
"PARIS: Roommates meeting starts in two minutes. Hey, I told you to stop with the math and the Sharpies on my good sheets."
"TANNA: Okay. Sorry."
"PARIS: How come the puppy doesn't pee on your bed?"
"RORY: I'll be right out, Paris."
"PARIS: Hurry up. All right, everyone, take a seat, please. Rory, one last curtsy, and let's move. [the roommates all gather in the common room]"
"RORY: My date will be here in ten minutes, so talk fast."
"PARIS: Thank you all for coming. Now, I'd like to start this meeting by saying that no one here is on trial. This meeting is about healing, it is about redemption, it is about accepting responsibility and making amends."
"JANET: I don't believe this."
"PARIS: This is a forum for all of us to air our grievances so we can resolve them and go on with our lives. Hey, since I'm already standing, why don't I start?"
"TANNA: This is thrilling."
"PARIS: Setting your alarm for 5:30 in the morning when no one else here shares the desire to put on nylon shorts and run in circles for an hour like a greyhound is selfish."
"JANET: I have a partial athletic scholarship, Paris."
"PARIS: The grunting and the sweating, and there are plastic balls everywhere."
"JANET: One balance ball."
"PARIS: No one can sleep. No one can breathe. Rory missed breakfast the other day. You've seen Rory eat. She cannot miss breakfast."
"RORY: Paris has a point there."
"JANET: Excuse me, but if I remember correctly, Rory missed breakfast because you turned her alarm off."
"RORY: Janet does have a point there."
"JANET: And while we're airing grievances, what about your stupid craft area? Everywhere you turn, there's glitter or seashells or macaroni. And the smell of the glue."
"PARIS: Hey, I make things we can all enjoy. I am contributing. The coasters I make are for everyone. Those push-ups are for you and you alone."
"JANET: I vote we get rid of craft corner."
"PARIS: No, that's my emotional homework!"
"RORY: Okay, let's just all calm down for a sec."
"JANET: No. I cannot calm down. I have tried to be reasonable. I have told myself over and over, ""God, look at her. Imagine what she's been through to make her turn out like that."""
"PARIS: A lot!"
"JANET: But you're impossible! And frankly, I'm just sick of your constant negativity!"
"PARIS: You're on steroids, aren't you? That's what's behind this obsessive behavior."
"JANET: You're calling me obsessive?"
"PARIS: I am not intimidated or afraid of you. [there's a knock at the door. Rory answers it]"
"TREVOR: Hi. You ready to go?"
"RORY: Just one sec. We're finishing up a roommates meeting."
"PARIS: I'll race you."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: To Hewitt Quad and back. I win, no alarm before seven a.m. You win, I move my crafts area into Rory's and my room."
"RORY: Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"JANET: Forget it. I am not gonna race -"
"PARIS: On your mark, get set, go. [runs out of the room]"
"JANET: Hey! [follows her]"
"TANNA: Now they're gonna have a nice musk."
"RORY: Shall we?"
"TREVOR: After you."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai opens the front door. Luke walks in with some bags of takeout]"
"LORELAI: Ah, man bearing bags of food. Come in."
"LUKE: I went a little overboard here."
"LORELAI: No such thing."
"LUKE: I got tons of fries, half a pumpkin pie. You got whipped cream here?"
"LORELAI: Always."
"LUKE: And, uh, I wasn't sure what to do with the burgers because sometimes you order with double cheese, sometimes you don't, so I brought one with normal cheese and one with. . .[sees Chinese food containers on the coffee table]. . .what did you do?"
"LORELAI: I ordered food."
"LUKE: I said I'd bring food."
"LORELAI: So I can't contribute, like I'm a piker?"
"LUKE: No. Just that I didn't need to bring food."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm leftover girl. I'll have the burgers tonight and the Chinese food during the week."
"LUKE: Then you just should have ordered the Chinese fresh tomorrow instead of tonight."
"LORELAI: I don't like fresh Chinese food. I like stale Chinese food."
"LUKE: I give up."
"LORELAI: I got you a nice, cold beer."
"LUKE: Appreciate it."
"LORELAI: Okay. You are one click away from ""Casablanca."""
"LUKE: Start it up."
"LORELAI: No, whoa, whoa, whoa. We need to get situated. Are you all situated?"
"LUKE: I'm situated."
"LORELAI: You need to, like, squish around a little."
"LUKE: I don't need to."
"LORELAI: Come on, squish around a little bit."
"LUKE: I'm fine how I am."
"LORELAI: Okay, but, uh, you can't squish during the movie because it's distracting. That's rule number one."
"LUKE: There's rules?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, especially for a true classic like ""Casablanca."" It's not like we're watching a there's-nothing-else-on movie or a guilty pleasure like ""Hardbodies."" Oh, my God. Have you seen ""Hardbodies""?"
"LUKE: I don't think so."
"LORELAI: Three middle-aged guys rent a beach house and they hire this young local stud to introduce them to cute girls, a.k.a. ""Hardbodies."""
"LUKE: Let's see that."
"LORELAI: No, Luke, we're seeing ""Casablanca."""
"LUKE: Then let's see that."
"LORELAI: Okay, the rest of the rules - no talking during the movie. No exceptions during a true classic. And minimize distraction. You know, no shifting around a lot, no phone calls, nothing. No going to the bathroom. If you go, you miss the movie 'cause we're not pausing the movie. That's the only way to get the flow of the thing, okay?"
"LUKE: Fair enough."
"LORELAI: Okay. Here we go. [starts the movie]"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: Okay, um. . .A, um, no talking during the movie, and B, don't tell me you've never seen the FBI warning before."
"LUKE: It's new to me."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God. You're beyond monk. You're uber-monk."
"LUKE: Just start it up. I won't talk again."
"LORELAI: Okay, just one more warning - when they showed the first motion picture over a hundred years ago, it featured a train rushing toward the camera, and, um, people were so sure the train was going to burst off the screen and crush them that they ran away in terror. Now, Luke, the train is not going to leave the screen."
"LUKE: Hit the button."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO ITALIAN RESTAURANT"
"[Rory and Trevor are on their date]"
"HOSTESS: Hang onto this. We'll page you when the table's ready."
"TREVOR: Thank you. A riot of color. Geeky but cool. Ever been to Italy?"
"RORY: No. Yes. What am I saying? Yes. I was just there. Duh."
"TREVOR: Hard thing to forget."
"RORY: Yeah. I'm just so used to not having been anywhere, but yeah, I have."
"TREVOR: And what's it like?"
"RORY: Terrific."
"TREVOR: Boy, they have these places all over. Two in Miami, Detroit. Hey, two in my hometown. Now, that's a great town."
"RORY: Definitely."
"TREVOR: So you've been there?"
"RORY: Where?"
"TREVOR: Chicago."
"RORY: Is that were you're from?"
"TREVOR: Oh, I thought you saw where I was pointing."
"RORY: Oh, no. Um. . ."
"TREVOR: You know, I miss things about home that I didn't think I'd miss. Like my little brother Brian. He drove me crazy my whole life, and now I can't wait for his e-mails. You have any siblings?"
"RORY: No. You know, I read this article once about restaurants like this where they have an open bowl of mints that you grab on your way out. And when people come out of the bathroom, a lot of them don't wash their hands. They'll grab a mint and walk out, and people have studied the mints and they found traces of urine in them, so they're urine mints."
"TREVOR: Huh. Oh. Hey, we're being paged."
"RORY: Good."
"HOSTESS: Right this way."
"[The hostess leads them to their table. Rory sits down, and Trevor sits down next to her on the same side of the table]"
"RORY: Oh."
"TREVOR: Thank you."
"HOSTESS: Enjoy."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Luke are watching the movie]"
"LUKE: Stop doing that."
"LORELAI: Shh, no talking."
"LUKE: Then stop doing that."
"LORELAI: Doing what?"
"LUKE: Looking at me."
"LORELAI: Vain party, table for one."
"LUKE: You know what I mean. You're watching me watch the movie. It's creepy."
"LORELAI: I enjoy watching people watch certain parts of certain movies."
"LUKE: But you look over just before something big happens, so I always know something's coming."
"LORELAI: Oh, I do?"
"LUKE: You did it just before Humphrey Bogart saw Ingrid Bergman for the first time."
"LORELAI: Well, she's the costar. You knew something was coming. [she rewinds the movie a little]"
"[the phone rings]"
"LUKE: There goes our flow."
"LORELAI: Well, we missed stuff while we were talking."
"[the answering machine comes on]"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hi, it's Lorelai. Leave me a message."
"LUKE: You're back too far, we've seen this."
"LORELAI: I didn't. I was looking at you."
"LUKE: We'll never get through this."
"RORY: [on answering machine] Mom, are you there?"
"LORELAI: Oh, wait, wait."
"LUKE: Come on."
"RORY: [on answering machine] Mom, if you're there, pick up."
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Honey, are you okay?"
"LUKE: There goes the phone rule."
"RORY: No, this whole night is sucking."
"LORELAI: What? How?"
"RORY: You're right - I've never dated before, and I know that now because of this feeling I have. I've never had this feeling before."
"LORELAI: Sort of frozen, sort of unsure, sort of wishing you'd read a lot of dating articles in preparation?"
"RORY: I have no idea what I'm doing here, and everyone is staring at me because they know we're on a bad first date."
"LORELAI: Oh, so the guy's a dud?"
"RORY: Trevor's fine. I'm moronic. I bring the conversation to a crashing halt every time I speak."
"LORELAI: Well, where is he now?"
"RORY: In the bathroom, probably pondering my brilliant anecdote about urine mints."
"LORELAI: About what?"
"RORY: You know, when people go to the bathroom and they don't wash their hands and they come out and they take a mint."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God. I've been eating those mints for years. [to Luke] Hey, did you know about urine mints?"
"LUKE: What?"
"RORY: And I've already forgotten everything that he said to me - the name of his brother and sister and best friend. And we're sitting on the same side of the table. We keep bumping menus, and my neck already hurts from trying to turn and look at him when he talks. Can I tell him to sit on the other side?"
"LORELAI: Honey, you just. . .you have to relax, 'cause it's just a date, and sometimes dates don't go well. I mean, I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but if he comes back and you're on the phone, it might make things more awkward."
"RORY: Bite the b*llet, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Sorry, but yeah."
"RORY: Okay. I'll talk to you later."
"LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up] Oh, poor thing."
"LUKE: Dating's the worst."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but they're sitting on the same side of the table and that's awkward, and she can't think of what to say next, and you know, she's just gotta go through it and figure it out on her own. You just have to throw them out there and let them learn what those wings are for."
"LUKE: She could say there's a draft."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Where she's sitting. She could say the air conditioning is hitting her, switch to the other side, and just blame it on that."
"LORELAI: That's perfect."
"[Lorelai calls Rory back]"
"RORY: [answers phone] Mom?"
"LORELAI: Hey. Is he back yet?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Say there's a draft and move to the other side of the table. It's very ladylike to feel drafts. He'll totally understand."
"RORY: Okay, good."
"LORELAI: And then ask what his brother and sister's names are. He'll like that you cared enough to confirm."
"RORY: Yeah, that seems right."
"LORELAI: Don't worry about the conversation. Just talk, and if the talk doesn't flow, it doesn't. And stay away from urine-related topics, and you're good to go."
"RORY: Thanks, Mom."
"LORELAI: Oh, the draft thing was Luke's."
"RORY: Well, thank him for me, too. I'd better go."
"LORELAI: Go, go. [hangs up] Oh, good. I feel so much better. She says thanks."
"LUKE: I wouldn't trade places with her for the world."
"LORELAI: Really? You wouldn't want to go out with a boy named Trevor? You might want to wait and see his picture."
"LUKE: I mean dating. It's a horror."
"LORELAI: It's the only cure for the singleness thing, barring ordering a spouse off the internet."
"LUKE: I missed nothing by not dating."
"LORELAI: Not true."
"LUKE: If I had dated a lot, I'd still be single. I'd just have spent a lot of bad nights at Tony Roma's."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but dating is how you get to know your potential partner. It's the only way."
"LUKE: There's the gut. I can tell if I'm comfortable with someone within seconds of meeting them. I feel it here. I felt it with Rachel. I felt it with Nicole. I was immediately relaxed."
"LORELAI: You've got the gut thing."
"LUKE: Well, it's just knowing that someone will let you be. That's a gut thing."
"LORELAI: Aah! You're fast-forwarding."
"LUKE: Well, we'll not gonna get through this thing. I just wanna get to the good parts."
"LORELAI: There are no bad parts of ""Casablanca."" Just go back. Back. I'm gonna go grab dessert."
"[Lorelai walks to the kitchen as the phone rings]"
"LUKE: Hey, phone again."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"LUKE: [answers phone] Hello?"
"EMILY: Who is this?"
"LUKE: Who's this?"
"EMILY: This is Emily Gilmore. Who's this?"
"LUKE: Luke Danes, Mrs. Gilmore. Your daughter's friend from the diner. Uh, hey, I'm not really supposed to be talking to you here. Hang on."
"LORELAI: Why did you answer the phone?"
"LUKE: You answered it before."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but that was Rory. You should have told her I'm not here."
"LUKE: Then what would I be doing here?"
"LORELAI: Light maintenance."
"LUKE: Come on, take it."
"LORELAI: You broke a rule."
"LUKE: You've broken every rule."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but dodging my mother's phone calls is not a movie-night rule. It's an always rule. [she takes the phone] Hi, Mom. What's up?"
"EMILY: So now you're telling people they can't speak to me?"
"LORELAI: No, Mom. It's just a little movie-night rule. If you and Luke wanna talk, you guys can talk."
"EMILY: I'm talking about Natalie Zimmerman."
"LORELAI: Natalie?"
"EMILY: I called her today about sprucing up a room she did for me a year ago, and, as you would say, she blew me off."
"LORELAI: Well, what did she say?"
"EMILY: She said she couldn't help me out, but she wouldn't say why, so I leaned on her a bit. She cracked and said she'd made you certain promises."
"LORELAI: Mom, I never told her she couldn't work for you."
"EMILY: She said you did."
"LORELAI: Well, no. Our agreement was -"
"EMILY: So there was an agreement."
"LORELAI: Yes, but -"
"EMILY: To exclude me?"
"LORELAI: No. Well, not exactly."
"EMILY: You know, Lorelai, perhaps it would be easier if you just gave me a list of the people I'm not allowed to have contact with. So far I know there's Natalie and Sookie and Luke on movie night. What about Richard? Am I still allowed to talk to my husband?"
"LORELAI: Mom, this is just a big misunderstanding. Go ahead and hire Natalie."
"EMILY: But you'll still have a problem with both of us using her."
"LORELAI: I will cease working with her. She's all yours. I'll tell her tomorrow."
"EMILY: Oh, wonderful. So it'll be my fault she loses the job. No, Lorelai, you keep her, and I promise I'll never speak to her - ever. If she's bleeding on the side of the road, I'll drive by and pretend I didn't see."
"LORELAI: Mom. . ."
"EMILY: I have to go."
"LORELAI: I'm firing Natalie."
"EMILY: That's up to you."
"LORELAI: Consider it done."
"EMILY: I'll see you Friday."
"LORELAI: Yup. [hangs up] I know just how you feel, Rick."
"LUKE: Shh."
"LORELAI: Tsk."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Later that night, Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey. Shh."
"[Luke is sleeping on the couch. Lorelai covers him up with a blanket]"
"RORY: Tell me he didn't fall asleep during ""Casablanca."""
"LORELAI: No, we made it through ""Casablanca."" He fell asleep during ""Hardbodies."""
"RORY: How do you fall asleep during a classic like ""Hardbodies""?"
"LORELAI: There's no accounting for taste."
"RORY: He looks comfy there, doesn't he?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, he does. [they walk to the kitchen] So, you wanna talk about it or you wanna forget about it?"
"RORY: Well, there's nothing much to talk about. It was just bad. I got a little better as the night went on - talked a little more. He was very nice, just not my type. Oh, and the whole draft thing backfired."
"LORELAI: How so?"
"RORY: Well, I switched over to the other side of the table. Then he started to feel the same draft and came over to my side."
"LORELAI: But we made up the draft."
"RORY: The power of suggestion."
"LORELAI: Boys are so malleable."
"RORY: It just all seemed so forced. I mean, I felt like I was locked into the pointless societal ritual. There has to be another way."
"LORELAI: Luke and I were debating that. Luke thinks it's all about gut instinct - you know instantly if a person is right for you. I think you have to go through a lot to find a contender. And you've been very lucky with boys before. They were just always sort of there, but I think for the most part, a girl's got to hunt a little."
"RORY: And go through a lot of non-contenders."
"LORELAI: Yes, then the non-contenders become your fun bad-date anecdotes. In fact, on your next date, if you're stuck for a topic, tell him about your bad date."
"RORY: But what if that date is bad?"
"LORELAI: Then you have an anecdote for your next date."
"RORY: And how long does this go on?"
"LORELAI: You've seen ""Grey Gardens."" It could go on forever."
"RORY: Oh, well, just sh**t me now."
"LORELAI: Hang in there. Go with Luke's gut thing if all else fails."
"RORY: Maybe."
"CUT TO YALE LAUNDRY ROOM"
"[Rory walks in. A guy is taking some clothes out of a dryer]"
"RORY: Oh, um. . ."
"GUY: Yeah?"
"RORY: I think my clothes were in there."
"GUY: Oh, yeah, somebody had already dumped them out, so I put 'em in my basket to keep 'em clean. Hope you don't mind."
"RORY: No. Thanks. Wow, that's the coolest laundry basket I've ever seen. I love The Smiths."
"GUY: I had an older brother that got me into them, and when my friends were listening to Hootie and the Blowfish, I was memorizing ""Meat is m*rder."""
"RORY: Well, I have a mom who's pretty much cooler than anyone you'd meet, and she did the same thing."
"GUY: Mine's a plain old soccer mom, but she's great."
"RORY: Well, being away like this makes you think about stuff like that, doesn't it - home?"
"GUY: Totally."
"RORY: Hey, would you maybe wanna get a cup of coffee sometime, in between classes or something?"
"GUY: I don't think so, but thanks. [leaves]"
"RORY: You're welcome."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily, and Richard are eating dinner]"
"EMILY: It's simply disgraceful."
"RICHARD: For years, we've had peace in the neighborhood."
"EMILY: I knew the Richmonds were going to be trouble when they missed the block party last month."
"LORELAI: I don't understand. They gave out full-size candy bars for Halloween. So what?"
"EMILY: Not full-size candy bars, Lorelai - king-size candy bars."
"RICHARD: We've been giving out full-size candy bars for years now."
"EMILY: And then those people move in and throw the entire balance of the neighborhood off. They made everybody look ridiculous."
"RICHARD: It's very embarrassing."
"EMILY: I think we have to do something about this - maybe go to the homeowners association."
"LORELAI: Two Halloweens ago, someone painted the Duprees' Chihuahua orange and nobody went to the homeowners association then."
"EMILY: Well, everybody hated Taco."
"LORELAI: I think you're making a little too much of this."
"EMILY: I saw Mae Richmond at Bay Wellington's two weeks before Halloween. She had ample time to bring it up then, and nothing - not a word. I think it might be time to go after their ball machine."
"RORY: Their ball machine?"
"RICHARD: They have a ball machine on their tennis court that is extraordinarily loud and unpredictable."
"EMILY: Flying, thumping balls all over the place."
"LORELAI: Flying, thumping what all over the place?"
"EMILY: Balls."
"[Lorelai giggles]"
"EMILY: You are four."
"LORELAI: And balls are funny."
"RICHARD: Don't worry, Emily. If the homeowners association doesn't do anything, we'll take this to the neighbors, get a petition going."
"LORELAI: Or if that doesn't work, you could throw some hoods on and burn a full-size Mars bar on their front lawn."
"EMILY: King-size, Lorelai - king-size."
"RORY: So, how's work, Grandpa?"
"LORELAI: Look how smoothly she changes the subject."
"RICHARD: Work is lovely, Rory. How's school?"
"RORY: Crazy."
"LORELAI: She's taking too many courses."
"RORY: I am not."
"EMILY: How many are you taking?"
"LORELAI: Five."
"EMILY: Is five a lot?"
"RORY: It's not a lot"
"LORELAI: It is a lot."
"RICHARD: I took five courses when I was a freshman. Rory takes after me."
"RORY: I like to be busy."
"RICHARD: Idle hands are the devil's playthings."
"LORELAI: That's actually the title of one of her classes."
"RORY: Please don't worry about me."
"LORELAI: She says to the mother and the grandmother."
"EMILY: Are you done?"
"RORY: Oh, yes, thank you."
"EMILY: Good, because we have mini lemon bundt cakes for dessert."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, they're serving full-size bundt cakes over at the Richmonds' house."
"EMILY: She's done."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I have a carrot."
"EMILY: She's done."
"LORELAI: Bet the Richmonds would have let me eat my carrot."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily walks into Richard's study, where a photographer is setting up to take a picture of Richard and Jason]"
"EMILY: All right, this should do it."
"RICHARD: May we please get this over with?"
"EMILY: Patience is a virtue, Richard."
"RICHARD: And time is fleeting, Emily."
"EMILY: You're starting a new partnership. You need new photographs, especially with that new look."
"JASON: I thought I'd give a beard a try."
"EMILY: Well, I like it. All right, Helmut, we're all set here."
"HELMUT: Okay. Important men doing important things. [takes a picture] Good. Oh, one more time. We're going to sign, and. . .[takes another picture] We're done."
"EMILY: Thank you, Helmut. That was wonderful."
"RICHARD: And now we sign the real papers."
"JASON: I'm feeling historic. You?"
"RICHARD: Oh, yes. It's Gettysburg all over again. Thank you."
"JASON: Important men doing important things."
"RICHARD: Now that makes it official. Jason."
"JASON: Let's give 'em hell."
"RICHARD: You bet."
"EMILY: Oh, I should have had Helmut get the handshake."
"RICHARD: The signing was fine, Emily. Sorry about the photo session."
"JASON: Oh, no, that's okay. I think it's a cute idea."
"EMILY: Yes, and when the financial papers call for an official photo, it'll be downright darling."
"RICHARD: I learned long ago, Jason, when it comes to things like this, Emily is always right."
"JASON: I am sure she is."
"EMILY: Thank you both. Jason, how's your time? Would you like to join us for dinner?"
"JASON: Oh, I'd love to, Emily, but I should get these papers up to my lawyer's office. Next week?"
"EMILY: Consider it an open invitation."
"JASON: Thank you. Richard, I'll see you tomorrow morning."
"RICHARD: Yes, you will."
"[Jason leaves]"
"EMILY: ""I think it's cute."""
"RICHARD: He's young, Emily."
"EMILY: Yes, well, a good smack on that scruffy face of his would age him up a bit. All right, let's discuss the launch party. Do you have any sort of particular feel in mind?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'll leave that to your discretion. Just make sure it's dignified."
"EMILY: We probably shouldn't go too fancy. Maybe we'll do one of those vodka bars - caviar, a Russian theme. I love that it's okay to be Russian again."
"RICHARD: It sounds lovely."
"EMILY: How's the 23rd?"
"RICHARD: Perfect."
"EMILY: And I want you to get a new suit."
"RICHARD: I don't need a new suit."
"EMILY: And find out what Jason's going to wear. I don't want the two of you showing up looking like the Bobbsey twins."
"RICHARD: Oh, yes, that would be embarrassing."
"EMILY: I'll need a guest list."
"RICHARD: Uh huh."
"EMILY: A Russian theme. I like that."
"CUT TO YALE CLASSROOM"
"[Rory is in one of her classes]"
"PROFESSOR: The conquering peoples impose their own values on the subjugated peoples through education, and quite often through the appointment of a priesthood from among their own ranks. This means we should not assume that the system of values has in some way evolved in a region. It is almost always imposed with the explicit purpose of keeping power in the hands of the powerful. Something to think about until next week, when we will burst more of your illusions. . .which brings me to a bit of bad news. There was an error in the syllabus you received. The dates were wrong, which means that all of your reading has been pushed up one week. I apologize for this cruel little life experience, but what can I do? I just found out my in-laws are moving back to town. None of us are immune. I'll see you all Tuesday."
"CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN"
"[The construction crew is working on the inn. Lorelai and Tom walk over to the barn.]"
"LORELAI: So, we were thinking maybe two horses to start with. See, it's so charming with the overhang here."
"TOM: You want me to turn this into stables?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"TOM: Without a magic wand or some sort of fairy dust?"
"LORELAI: Preferably, yes."
"TOM: Let me take a look inside."
"LORELAI: We'd like to keep the existing structure, please."
"KIRK: Lorelai, I'm all set up as soon as you're ready."
"LORELAI: Be right there, Kirk."
"KIRK: Okie dokie."
"TOM: How attached are you gonna get to these horses?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"TOM: You gonna name 'em, feed 'em apples, braid their tails?"
"LORELAI: Why, Tom?"
"TOM: Well, the roof's about to cave in so I can stay within our budget, but then I'd just call 'em all Trigger."
"LORELAI: Just tell me how much more it's gonna cost."
"TOM: Okay."
"[Sookie arrives]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, you're here."
"LORELAI: I'm always here."
"SOOKIE: Listen, I want to talk to you about something very exciting."
"LORELAI: Ooh, very exciting. I love very exciting."
"SOOKIE: This morning I got a call from your mother."
"LORELAI: This is the very exciting?"
"SOOKIE: Yes! She's doing a launch party for your father's new business and she wants us to do the catering."
"LORELAI: Us?"
"SOOKIE: Us!"
"LORELAI: Did you say us?"
"SOOKIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: To her. Did you say ""us"" to her?"
"SOOKIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: So she knows about us?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, she knows about us, I think. What does she know about us?"
"LORELAI: That we have a catering business?"
"SOOKIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh, man!"
"SOOKIE: What? Did I do something bad?"
"LORELAI: No, nothing, nothing. It's my fault. I forgot to tell her."
"SOOKIE: How could you forget to tell her?"
"LORELAI: Well, I've only seen her forty or fifty times since we started the business. Now what did she say exactly?"
"SOOKIE: Well, she asked me to cater, and I said we'd love to, and then she said, ""we?"" so I said you and I had started a company, so it'd be the both of us together, and she said fine."
"LORELAI: Was there a pause before ""fine"" or was it just ""fine""?"
"SOOKIE: I don't remember. I just remember the ""fine."""
"LORELAI: She's mad."
"SOOKIE: I swear she didn't sound mad."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Good."
"LORELAI: Now let's talk about how much I can't do this."
"SOOKIE: Look, I knew it would be a thing working for your mother, but it's perfect timing. This is probably the last job we'll be able to take before I have the baby."
"LORELAI: Something else will come along."
"SOOKIE: Not that pays like your mother does."
"LORELAI: You know why she pays so much? So she can torture you and you won't throw knives at her."
"SOOKIE: Look, you already know the house. Decorating, planning - it's gonna be a snap for you. I bet you can spend ninety percent of the evening in the kitchen, then we get to take home the pretty, pretty money."
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Pretty, pretty money. Aren't you a big fat wad of pretty money?"
"LORELAI: Fine."
"SOOKIE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Shouldn't ask again."
"SOOKIE: Accepting and moving on."
"KIRK: Excuse me, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God, Kirk, I forgot you were here."
"KIRK: If I had a nickel for every time I heard that."
"LORELAI: I'm very, very sorry. You have my full attention."
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna go. Um, we'll talk tomorrow about the details."
"LORELAI: Okay. All right, Kirk, show me what you got."
"KIRK: If you'll just follow me, I would like to present you with my new line of one-of-a-kind mailboxes."
"LORELAI: Wow. They look very nice, Kirk."
"KIRK: And whimsical. They say to the world, ""I'll take my mail with a smile."""
"LORELAI: Yes, they do say that."
"KIRK: And since you are one of our preferred customers, with the purchase of one of our mailboxes, I'll throw in a carved-duck doorstop and a garlic peeler."
"LORELAI: Wow, that's quite an offer, Kirk, but I think it's a little early for me to pick a mailbox. We haven't even settled on a color for the inn yet."
"KIRK: Well, whimsy goes with everything."
"LORELAI: Kirk, I promise, just as soon as. . .is that Condoleezza Rice?"
"KIRK: Yes, it is. I'm a fan, and her big mouth is perfect for shoving mail in."
"LORELAI: Ha. Uh, I'll have to think about it."
"KIRK: Fair enough. So, I hear you're running a catering business now."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, just temporarily."
"KIRK: You guys any good?"
"LORELAI: Not bad."
"KIRK: And how much would one have to pay for your culinary services?"
"LORELAI: It depends, the type of food, number of people, kind of venue."
"KIRK: Simple food, two guests, my mother's living room."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"KIRK: I have a visitor coming in from out of town and I thought it would be nice to serve her a catered meal."
"LORELAI: Her?"
"KIRK: Actually, she was my brother's ex-girlfriend - Lulu."
"LORELAI: Good name."
"KIRK: I had sort of a crush on her for a while, and she's coming home to visit her mother, and she called me."
"LORELAI: Kirk, you have a date."
"KIRK: No, just an appointment to take Lulu to dinner."
"LORELAI: That's a date."
"KIRK: I don't have high hopes for it, if that's what you're thinking."
"LORELAI: Kirk, it's very sweet, but are you sure you want to have dinner in your living room?"
"KIRK: Well, the breakfast nook doesn't seem festive enough."
"LORELAI: Right, but while you're having dinner in your living room, where will your mother be?"
"KIRK: Probably in the living room."
"LORELAI: Is that what you really want? To have dinner with your mother watching?"
"KIRK: I could ask her to face the wall."
"LORELAI: Or you could take Lulu out to a restaurant."
"KIRK: Which one?"
"LORELAI: Well, what does she like?"
"KIRK: I don't know. Should I call my brother and find out?"
"LORELAI: I think if he knew, she'd probably still be with him."
"KIRK: I just really want it to be nice."
"LORELAI: Just take her someplace where you're comfortable. It doesn't have to be fancy. If you like it, she'll like it."
"KIRK: Okay."
"LORELAI: Just not one attached to a bowling alley."
"KIRK: That narrows it down a bit. I'll figure something out."
"LORELAI: Good. You'll see - it'll be great."
"KIRK: Do you think I could stop by tomorrow with some wardrobe choices for you to pick out?"
"LORELAI: Kirk, you can dress yourself. Just look nice. You know, not too fancy. Clean. No jeans. Oh, maybe a sport coat. Eleven sound good?"
"KIRK: Perfect."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory walks into her suite. Janet is jogging on a trampoline in the common room]"
"RORY: A trampoline. That's new."
"JANET: Helps with my shin splints."
"RORY: Huh. Wow. Squeaky."
"JANET: Yup. Phone."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Rory walks into her bedroom. The phone is ringing. Paris is ignoring it]"
"RORY: Paris, can you get the phone? Paris?"
"PARIS: Don't answer it."
"RORY: Why not?"
"PARIS: It's Jamie and we're fighting."
"RORY: Well, does he know you're fighting? 'Cause he's not hanging up."
"PARIS: Oh, he knows. Trust me, he knows."
"RORY: Okay. You're seriously not gonna answer that?"
"PARIS: Nope."
"RORY: Paris, come on."
"PARIS: Fine. [picks up the phone, then hangs it back up] There."
"RORY: Why are you and Jamie fighting?"
"PARIS: Because he's wrong."
"RORY: Oh, okay."
"[the phone starts ringing again]"
"PARIS: He won't listen to me. [picks up the phone] You won't listen to me! [hangs up] He's in love with the sound of his own voice. You'd think he was already president and I don't want to be Hillary. I don't want to wait for a hundred years while he does his thing so by the time I get my chance, I'm too old to enjoy it."
"RORY: Well, I don't think Hillary's too old to enjoy it."
"PARIS: Fine. Be on his side."
"RORY: I'm not on his side. I'm on her side."
"[the phone starts ringing again]"
"PARIS: Don't answer it."
"RORY: Paris, I have to study!"
"PARIS: Go ahead."
"RORY: I can't!"
"PARIS: Why not?"
"RORY: The phone."
"PARIS: Don't, Rory! I mean it!"
"RORY: [answers the phone] Hello? Hi, Jamie. Yes, she is here."
"PARIS: No."
"RORY: Paris, you're acting stupid, okay? You love Jamie, so just get on the phone and work it out so that I can study, okay?"
"PARIS: [takes the phone] What? No, I haven't thought about what you said. Because I'm very busy, Jamie, and contrary to your beliefs, I have better things to occupy my time with than thinking about you. Or what you said. Or what you meant or what you want or anything about you or concerning you. [Rory grabs the phone from her] Hey!"
"RORY: Have him call you back on your cell phone. Then you can talk to him outside. It's nice outside. There are birds and trees."
"PARIS: My cell phone is dead."
"RORY: Then take mine."
"PARIS: What's your phone plan?"
"RORY: Why?"
"PARIS: 'Cause I'm not gonna borrow your phone and get slammed with a massive charge because your phone plan sucks."
"RORY: Paris!"
"PARIS: [on phone] Jamie, I'm going to call you back on Rory's cell. Yes, I am. Yes, I am!"
"RORY: Yes, she is!"
"PARIS: Okay, bye. [hangs up]"
"RORY: Here."
"PARIS: I'll be back."
"RORY: Take your time."
"[Paris leaves. Rory sits down to study, but is distracted by the sound of the TV. She walks to the common room]"
"RORY: Tanna, I'm trying to study."
"TANNA: Okay."
"RORY: I can hear the TV through the wall."
"TANNA: Okay."
"RORY: It's distracting."
"TANNA: Are you telling me to turn it off?"
"RORY: I'm not telling -"
"TANNA: You can, you know, because your grandma paid for the TV."
"RORY: I'm not telling you to turn the TV off."
"TANNA: Because you can."
"RORY: The TV belongs to all of us."
"TANNA: If it's a matter of volume, I could press my ear to the speaker and then I could turn it really low."
"RORY: Never mind."
"TANNA: The problem there is that the speakers for the TV are mounted up in the corner of the ceiling, but perhaps if I got a ladder."
"RORY: Never mind, Tanna."
"TANNA: Are you sure you don't want me to turn it off?"
"[Rory leaves]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Sookie takes a pan of broccoli tarts out of the oven. She picks one up and holds it out toward Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: Try this one."
"LORELAI: Sookie, I love you, I love your cooking, but I swear if you make me eat one more bite of broccoli tart, I will b*at you to death with it."
"SOOKIE: Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for. She has impeccable taste, the highest standards, and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away."
"LORELAI: Well, depending on how long it's been left out, we all can."
"SOOKIE: You know, she still hasn't called yet."
"LORELAI: She will."
"SOOKIE: But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago."
"LORELAI: She will, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: But it's coming up and we still don't know if she wants a fish course or a cheese course."
"LORELAI: We'll make a fish-cheese combo course just to be sure."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Why do I have to call her?"
"SOOKIE: Because technically you're doing the organizing, and I've got batter hands. Oh, ask her about the foie gras. Is it too expected? 'Cause I can make it with a, you know, cherry compote. Okay. You know. . .you know what to say."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hello, Mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai, hello. How nice to hear from you."
"LORELAI: How are you doing?"
"EMILY: Well, I'm just fine, thank you for asking."
"LORELAI: Good, I'm glad to hear it."
"EMILY: And I'm glad to report it."
"LORELAI: Uh, so the reason I'm calling is we haven't heard from you yet, and we really need to nail down some of the details of the party."
"EMILY: ""We"" haven't heard from you yet?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we - me and Sookie."
"EMILY: Ah, yes, the Independence Catering Company."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. So, anyhow -"
"EMILY: You know, a few years ago, there was a company called Independent Catering. They were all the rage until they catered the Kirov benefit for diabetes that sent 300 people to the hospital with a vicious case of food poisoning. Well, needless to say, they went out of business immediately, and I believe one of them left town without packing."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, that's a good story. Hans Christian Anderson?"
"EMILY: You know, some people could mistake the Independence Catering Company with the Independent Catering Company, and that would just be a shame for you, wouldn't it? Now if I'd known what you were going to name your company, I could have warned you."
"LORELAI: Mom, I swear, I tried to tell you."
"EMILY: You did?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I did. I sent you a flier. Didn't you get my flier?"
"EMILY: No, I did not get your flier."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I sent it, and to be, um, honest with you, I was a little hurt that you didn't call to congratulate me, but now that I know you didn't get it, I forgive you."
"EMILY: When did you send a flier?"
"LORELAI: Last week."
"EMILY: What did it say?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you know. . .come and get it."
"EMILY: You wrote ""come and get it"" on your business flier?"
"LORELAI: Well, no, it was your basic ""Introducing the Independence Catering Company"", uh, flier. You know, it had our phone number, our address, and an amusing caricature of us."
"EMILY: Well, that sounds like a very nice flier."
"LORELAI: Oh, it was."
"EMILY: Do you have an extra one? You can bring it with you on Friday night."
"LORELAI: Uh, sure."
"EMILY: Because it's very unusual these days for things to get lost in the mail. You don't think you got the address wrong, do you?"
"LORELAI: Mom, the party?"
"EMILY: All right. I'm going to want a mixture of white, off-white, and cream-colored linen. A simple bone china with a gold or deep-blue stripe will work."
"LORELAI: Okay, got it."
"EMILY: I'm going with tapers cut in half so that people can see each other across the table. We'll need white and sterling roses, but not too high or formal. Do you have a florist?"
"LORELAI: I have a florist."
"EMILY: Does he have a flier?"
"LORELAI: Do you want clear or silver vases?"
"EMILY: You must think I'm a complete idiot."
"LORELAI: No, Mom, I don't."
"EMILY: There is no flier. You're making it up to cover for the fact that you once again neglected to tell me about an important event in your life."
"LORELAI: Mom, I swear there's a flier."
"EMILY: Shame on you for swearing there's a flier. That's the worst possible thing you could do."
"LORELAI: Liv Tyler grew up her entire life thinking Todd Rundgren was her real father. You think that might knock this out of first place?"
"EMILY: I tell you, if I saw this kind of behavior from some other company I was hiring, I would fire them on the spot."
"LORELAI: Then fire us, Mom."
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: You are not hiring your daughter and her friend, you are hiring a professional catering company. This is not a favor, it is a business transaction, and I must insist that you treat us exactly as you would any other person off the street."
"EMILY: As you wish."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Now I'm sorry, but we're very busy with preparations for your event, so I'm gonna have to hang up now. Goodbye, Mother."
"EMILY: Goodbye."
"[they hang up]"
"LORELAI: Aah! Horrible woman!"
"SOOKIE: You, uh, forgot to ask about the menu."
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: My dorm room has turned into a ""Three Stooges"" movie. Shove Pop Tarts under the door in two hours please."
"LORELAI: Uh, honey. . ."
"[They walk into Rory's bedroom, which is filled with trays of broccoli tarts]"
"RORY: You quiched my room."
"SOOKIE: They're not quiche. They're broccoli tarts."
"RORY: Well, then you tarted up my room."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, honey, I didn't know you were coming home today. Sookie's just trying some things out for Grandma's party."
"RORY: How am I supposed to study when it smells like broccoli?"
"LORELAI: Well, study in the living room."
"RORY: This is not living room study. This is serious bedroom study. I have a ton of work to do."
"LORELAI: Well, hey, here's a crazy thought - isn't there someplace at Yale you can study? Don't they have like a hundred libraries?"
"RORY: Yes, but they don't have that right vibe. They're too quiet and too big and drafty. Very, very drafty."
"LORELAI: At least they don't smell like quiche."
"SOOKIE: Enough with the quiche, okay?"
"RORY: I can't believe I came all the way home and there's nowhere to work."
"LORELAI: Well, it's just temporary."
"RORY: 'Til the sewing machine comes."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. . .you know how many kids in India would love to come home to a room full of quiche? Sorry - tarts."
"SOOKIE: Tarts are totally different."
"LORELAI: I know, honey. I know."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Kirk walks in]"
"LUKE: Have a seat, Kirk. I'll be right there. [walks over to Caesar] Caesar."
"CAESAR: Yes?"
"LUKE: You know what the key to a truly successful tuna melt is?"
"CAESAR: What?"
"LUKE: Tuna."
"CAESAR: That's not tuna?"
"LUKE: No, it's turkey."
"CAESAR: Give me the plate. I'll do it again."
"LUKE: Don't get exasperated with me. I'm not the one that made the wrong sandwich. [walks over to Kirk] What are you doing, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Say I was Tom Cruise. Where would you seat me?"
"LUKE: In an acting class."
"KIRK: No, I mean, which do you consider the best seat in the house?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"KIRK: How are the acoustics here?"
"LUKE: What?"
"KIRK: Well, the bathrooms are right over there. One good loud flush and the entire mood is spoiled."
"LUKE: I don't have time to k*ll you right now, Kirk. Come back in a couple of hours."
"KIRK: All right, I'll just reserve these three tables and decide later."
"LUKE: Reserve these three -"
"KIRK: For Wednesday night, eight o'clock."
"LUKE: We don't take reservations, Kirk."
"KIRK: But this is a special occasion. And Lorelai told me to go somewhere I'm comfortable, and I'm comfortable here."
"LUKE: You are?"
"KIRK: Well, not at this moment, but previously I have been comfortable here. Please?"
"LUKE: What's the occasion?"
"KIRK: I have a date with a young lady."
"LUKE: You really felt the need to add the ""with a young lady"" part?"
"KIRK: Kinda."
"LUKE: Okay, you can have one table for eight o'clock."
"KIRK: Thank you. Here."
"LUKE: What's this?"
"KIRK: It's a diagram of how I would like the table set up. See - little flowers by her plate, and the champagne bucket over here so I don't accidentally knock it off the table with my elbow."
"LUKE: I don't sell champagne, Kirk."
"KIRK: Why not?"
"LUKE: Because this is a diner."
"KIRK: Good champagne goes with everything."
"LUKE: Get your own champagne, Kirk."
"KIRK: But what about the flowers?"
"LUKE: Kirk."
"KIRK: Okay, fine. I'll get the champagne and the flowers. Now, let's say the date goes well. How much for the place upstairs?"
"LUKE: You mean my apartment?"
"KIRK: Yes."
"LUKE: Bye, Kirk."
"KIRK: Okay, see you later. [to female customer] Excuse me, is that good?"
"CUSTOMER: Yes."
"KIRK: And what is that?"
"CUSTOMER: Meat loaf."
"KIRK: Okay, so, this meat loaf, is it a romantic food for you? I mean, is it getting you hot?"
"LUKE: Kirk!"
"KIRK: Good talking to you."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie arrive and unload some things from the back of the Jeep]"
"LORELAI: I can't believe we're doing this."
"SOOKIE: Well, you did tell her to treat us like any other catering service."
"LORELAI: ""I'd like you to do a test meal, Lorelai. After all, you are a new company."" Ugh, she must be so happy right now. She's probably been cackling into her magic mirror all morning."
"SOOKIE: It's going to be a breeze. You wait and see."
"LORELAI: Three hours of bowing and scraping."
"SOOKIE: We are not going to be bowing and scraping. We're going to be serving and delighting."
"LORELAI: Anything to humiliate me, anything at all."
"SOOKIE: Wow! You grew up here?"
"LORELAI: I swear, if she makes me wear a uniform. . ."
"SOOKIE: This is Citizen Kane's house."
"LORELAI: Drape one of those napkins over my arm."
"SOOKIE: Is there a moat?"
"[they ring the doorbell]"
"LORELAI: Just help me out here, okay? Run interference whenever you can."
"SOOKIE: I promise."
"[the maid answers the door]"
"MAID: May I help you?"
"SOOKIE: Hi. We're the caterers. We're here for -"
"MAID: The servants' entrance is around back. [shuts the door]"
"SOOKIE: Was that a maid?"
"LORELAI: Come on."
"SOOKIE: What are all those tennis balls doing over here?"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory walks in and heads toward her suite. A student walks past her]"
"GLENN: Irish studies suck, German studies suck, everything here sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks!"
"RORY: That yoga's really working for you, Glenn."
"[Rory stops outside her suite door and listens to the noise inside - the television, the squeaking trampoline, the phone ringing.]"
"PARIS: [from inside the suite] Don't get that, I mean it! Do not touch that phone!"
"[Rory walks out of the dorm. She goes outside and sits down under a tree to study]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily is seated at the dining room table, Lorelai is standing next to her. Emily adjusts the position of a wineglass]"
"LORELAI: Oh, great, I'm glad you got that. It's been bugging me for the last. . ."
"EMILY: Is this the off-white or the cream?"
"LORELAI: Uh, the off-white. The cream is more creamy. I cut those myself so they could be adjusted either way. I mean, they could be adjusted smaller. Taller would be tougher once they're cut, but, uh, if they tell a lie, they'll sh**t right back up."
"EMILY: I assume you'll have servers."
"LORELAI: Yes, we will."
"EMILY: I assume you'll instruct your servers to omit the Pinocchio humor."
"LORELAI: Yes, we will."
"[Sookie walks in with some dishes of food]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, here we go. Now, we would start off with either the roasted asparagus with the Parmesan or the trio of winter soups - tomato basil, butternut squash, and Catalonian garlic."
"EMILY: Very ambitious."
"SOOKIE: And very tasty."
"[While Emily examines the food, Lorelai and Sookie gesture to each other, then quickly stop when Emily looks up]"
"LORELAI: I'll tell the servers not to do that either."
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"EMILY: My napkin."
"LORELAI: Oh, oh, well, yes. Napkin, yes, your napkin. I got it. Do you want me to just tuck it in your shirt there or. . ."
"EMILY: My lap will be fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. There you go. Feel free to spill anything you want down there. You are covered."
"[Emily tries some of the food while Lorelai and Sookie look on]"
"EMILY: What is the next course?"
"SOOKIE: Lobster potpie."
"EMILY: You may bring it out now."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"EMILY: Sookie, how far along are you?"
"SOOKIE: Eight months."
"EMILY: Lorelai, there doesn't seem to be any reason for a pregnant woman in her eighth month to be running back and forth to the kitchen, does there?"
"LORELAI: No, there doesn't."
"EMILY: You should take my plate. Otherwise, you'll have no place to put the potpie."
"LORELAI: Oh, I can think of a place."
"EMILY: What was that?"
"LORELAI: Plates going bye-bye."
"[Lorelai walks to the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: [to the maid] Okay, when I give the signal, you run in and distract her and I'll take her down. Got it?"
"[Lorelai returns to the dining room]"
"LORELAI: Here we go - Sookie's famous lobster potpie."
"EMILY: Very nice crust."
"SOOKIE: Thank you."
"EMILY: Well, Sookie, I must say your food is as accomplished as I remember it."
"SOOKIE: Oh, thank you, Emily."
"EMILY: And I think after we fine-tune the presentation, we'll have ourselves a very nice dinner party."
"SOOKIE: So we got the job?"
"EMILY: Yes, you got the job."
"SOOKIE: We got the job. Thank you. You will not be disappointed."
"EMILY: No, I will not. The event starts at 7:30, I would like you to be here at four o'clock. I'm going to make a Xerox copy of my notes here so the two of you can peruse it on the way home. [leaves the room]"
"SOOKIE: We did it, we got the job! What a score! We landed a whale."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we always had the job, Sookie. The whale was just toying with us. She was swatting us with her tail and hosing us down with her blowhole because that is the whale's M.O. - humiliate and rip apart every other fish in the sea until there's nothing left but a bloody pile of chum."
"SOOKIE: Boy, you really hate whales, don't you?"

"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is on the phone]"
"RORY: It's amazing. Out of the blue, bam! It was right there."
"LORELAI: Well, things always happen when you least expect it."
"RORY: I have to tell you, this tree is perfect."
"LORELAI: All girls think their tree is perfect."
"RORY: It fits my back completely, and there's plenty of grass, and it's in a great area - just far enough away from anything major so there's not a lot of noise but still not in Siberia."
"LORELAI: Hey, can it cook? 'Cause I can get it a great gig with a crazy woman."
"RORY: Grandma's not crazy. She's specific."
"LORELAI: Well, at least one of us is happy."
"RORY: And thank God it's me."
"LORELAI: My feelings exactly."
"RORY: You have no idea how much studying I got done today. Seriously, ask me anything."
"LORELAI: Okay. Um, how'd I get shanghaied into catering a party for my mother?"
"RORY: You keep repeating yourself."
"LORELAI: Well, as soon as I hear you talking about a study shrub, I'll know it's time to move on."
"RORY: Okay, fine, I have to go."
"LORELAI: Yeah? Gonna go shopping for a nice yellow ribbon?"
"RORY: Have some chili fries for me."
"LORELAI: I will."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Cheeseburger, onion rings, and a list of people who k*ll their parents and got away with it. I'm looking for heroes."
"LUKE: How'd the tasting go?"
"LORELAI: We got the job."
"LUKE: Would have been pathetic if you hadn't."
"LORELAI: I can't do this."
"LUKE: It's a gig."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is a gig. It's Prince opening for the Rolling Stones. That's the kind of gig it is."
"[Lorelai sees Kirk sitting at a table with a video camera set up across from him]"
"LORELAI: Luke. . ."
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: What's Kirk doing?"
"LUKE: Practicing."
"LORELAI: Hm. For what?"
"LUKE: His date. He's doing a test run - talking, eating, making conversation. Then he's gonna go home and review the tape and adjust from there."
"LORELAI: Boy! You ever think about how many different ways Kirk could get kicked out of the Army?"
"LUKE: What a poor slob. He's pathetic."
"LORELAI: He likes a girl. That's sweet."
"LUKE: All day long, I have this crazy person sitting in my diner ordering everything off the menu, by the way, to see which meal has less crumb-to-sweater ratio."
"LORELAI: Well, if he's bugging you that much, you can ask him to leave."
"LUKE: You ask him to leave. It's your fault he's here."
"LORELAI: How is it my fault? I'm not going out with him."
"LUKE: You're the one that told him to find someplace he felt comfortable."
"LORELAI: How did I know he felt comfortable here?"
"LUKE: I don't know. All I know is that you talked to him, and now he's over there talking to a camera."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on, Luke. Give him a break. He wants the date to go well. I mean, it's all any of us wants - to find a nice person to hang out with 'til we drop dead. Not a lot to ask."
"LUKE: I guess."
"LORELAI: And look on the positive side - if Kirk's date goes well, he'll be occupied, and you'll be seeing a lot less of him at the diner."
"KIRK: Cut! Okay, that sucked! Let's just go again right away. Focus! Focus."
"LUKE: I'll have his monogrammed booth installed tomorrow."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily is looking over some papers in the dining room when Richard walks in]"
"RICHARD: All right, I think this should be everyone."
"EMILY: You've double-checked it?"
"RICHARD: I have double-checked it, but I'm sure you will also double-check it."
"EMILY: You know I will."
"RICHARD: So I am entirely confident that no one will be left out. This is very nice."
"EMILY: Isn't it, though? It's a florist Lorelai found. We're using him for the party."
"RICHARD: Oh, I think that will be perfect."
"EMILY: It has to be perfect. These are important people we're trying to impress."
"[Jason walks in]"
"JASON: Richard, Emily."
"RICHARD: Jason, what a pleasant surprise."
"EMILY: Richard, you should have told me Jason was coming over. I would have had something prepared."
"JASON: Oh, please, Emily, I've gained ten pounds since I came into this house."
"EMILY: Men always say that and it's never true."
"JASON: I just dropped by for the keys to the office."
"RICHARD: Ah, that's right. Forgot to give you the keys. Oh, my apologies, Jason. Here you go."
"JASON: Thank you. Sorry to interrupt your evening. I'll see you tomorrow."
"EMILY: Oh, Jason, I'm going to need your guest list as soon as possible."
"JASON: My guest list?"
"EMILY: To the launch party. Oh, Richard, you did remember to ask Jason for his list, didn't you?"
"RICHARD: Emily, I am a very busy man."
"EMILY: Oh, honestly, Richard, that's what you have a secretary for. Jason, I apologize for my husband. The official launch party for your company is next week. I've got the entire thing organized. All I need is your guest list."
"JASON: You organized a launch party."
"RICHARD: Yes, and trust me when I tell you that there is no one who can throw together a more elegant event at the drop of a hat than Emily Gilmore."
"EMILY: True, and thank you, and you still forgot to tell him."
"JASON: Well, Emily, I really appreciate the thought, but I'm not so sure a launch party is the way to go."
"EMILY: What do you mean?"
"RICHARD: Well, Jason, it's traditional to do something for our clients. They appreciate it. It gives us a chance to talk to them one-on-one, develop relationships."
"EMILY: It's the extra little things that set you apart in business, Jason."
"JASON: I couldn't agree more, and that is why I've organized a trip to Atlantic City."
"EMILY: What?"
"JASON: You know, get everybody out, away from business, away from their spouses, away from stuffy cocktail-party music and floral arrangements. Have a little crazy fun - you know, good food, lots to drink, maybe a little gambling, a show, and trust me, nothing bonds two businessmen together more than one of them finding the other hung over with a hooker in their bed the next morning."
"EMILY: What?"
"JASON: Just a figure of speech, Emily."
"EMILY: You cannot be serious. These are dignified men and women. There are mobsters in Atlantic City."
"JASON: Let's hope so."
"EMILY: Talk to him."
"RICHARD: Well, Jason, I'm not so sure this -"
"JASON: Richard, this is the kind of thing that could set us apart from the other companies. It's different, maybe a little crazy, but they will remember it and they will tell their friends about it."
"RICHARD: Yes, I suppose they will."
"JASON: Every other company in town is throwing a dignified cocktail party. Believe me, right now my mother has twelve caterers throttling every sturgeon they can find to get fine caviar for my father's clients. Let's not give our clients canapés, Richard. Let's give 'em some fun."
"RICHARD: Well, it is different."
"EMILY: You can't be serious."
"RICHARD: Well, it's good to change with the times."
"EMILY: You're running an insurance company, not a rap label. People aren't looking to you to give them a good time. They are looking to you to protect their livelihood."
"RICHARD: Now let's think about this for a moment. I mean, how far along is this party? Is it too late to cancel?"
"EMILY: No, it's not too late to cancel."
"RICHARD: All right. Jason, we'll try it your way. Atlantic City it is."
"JASON: I think it's a good move, Richard. And Emily, thank you again for the offer. But see, now you can just hang out and relax."
"EMILY: My two favorite things."
"RICHARD: All right, see you tomorrow."
"JASON: See you tomorrow."

"[Rory walks up to her study tree and finds a guy reading under it]"
"RORY: Um, excuse me, you're sitting under my tree."
"GUY: What?"
"RORY: My study tree - this is my study tree."
"GUY: What the hell's a study tree?"
"RORY: Okay. See, I have roommates -"
"GUY: So do I."
"RORY: Yes, but I have Paris and I have Tanna and I have Janet, and Janet squeaks -"
"GUY: Look, I'm busy, okay?"
"RORY: Yes, I see you're very busy with your ""Trucker's Monthly"" there, but I finally found a great place to study, and you're sitting on it."
"GUY: There's a million trees on campus."
"RORY: But this one fits my back perfectly so I don't get tired, and the light is right, and it's just far enough away from anything busy so that the noise level is perfect, and it's quiet but not b*mb, and. . .and anyhow, I was just hoping that maybe you would consider giving me back my tree."
"GUY: No."

"KIRK: Yes, diners are apparently all the rage nowadays."
"LULU: Really?"
"KIRK: Very hip. Very, very hip. Excuse me."
"LUKE: Yes?"
"KIRK: I believe I have reservations for two. The name's Kirk."
"LUKE: Kirk, yes. Okay. Follow me. How's this?"
"KIRK: Very satisfactory. Thank you. [hands him a dollar bill] There's more where that came from."
"LUKE: It's my lucky night."
"LULU: Wow, I'm getting the fancy treatment."

"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"EMILY: Then why are you in your pajamas?"
"LORELAI: These aren't pajamas."
"EMILY: You wear that in public?"
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom. Would you like to come in?"
"[they walk to the living room]"
"EMILY: You have the word ""juicy"" on your rear end."
"LORELAI: Uh, well, if I had known you were coming over, I would have changed."
"EMILY: Into what, a brassiere with the word ""tasty"" on it?"
"LORELAI: Hey, Mom, what can I do for you?"
"EMILY: I have to talk to you about something."
"LORELAI: Is everything okay?"
"EMILY: I'm afraid you aren't going to be catering the launch party after all."
"LORELAI: What? Why?"
"EMILY: Your father and I just decided to go a different way, that's all."
"LORELAI: A different way?"
"EMILY: Now, of course, I realize you've already put out some money."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we have."
"EMILY: Of course, I will reimburse you for all expenses. Just give me the receipts."
"LORELAI: Great."
"EMILY: That's it. That's all I came to tell you."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, thanks for the notice."
"EMILY: You don't have to take that tone with me, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Really, I don't? After you made us do that ridiculous tasting at the house?"
"EMILY: You told me to treat you like any other company."
"LORELAI: Oh, but you sat there like the Queen of England, making us jump through hoops and taking ridiculous notes and for what - so you could fire us? Is this payback for me not telling you about the business? Because, I have to say, Mom, even for you, it seems a little extreme."
"EMILY: I understand you're upset."
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm upset! We needed that money, Mom. And I knew that humiliation was part of the package, but I did it because I had to, and - just you abruptly firing us is completely wrong!"
"EMILY: I agree, it is wrong."
"LORELAI: Well, okay, then. . .as long as you agree it's wrong. . what? Okay."
"EMILY: I'm sorry, Lorelai. I really am. I thought your table was lovely. I thought the food was wonderful. I was really looking forward to this party. I think it might have been the best one I ever put on."
"LORELAI: So, then, what happened?"
"EMILY: Oh, you know, times change, Lorelai. Things that were once considered proper and elegant are now considered stuffy and out-of-date."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"EMILY: Like canapés and cocktail parties and the people who plan them."
"LORELAI: Mom, what are you talking about?"
"EMILY: Nothing. It's not important."
"LORELAI: Mom, come on."
"EMILY: Jason decided to take the clients to Atlantic City instead. He thinks that's what they would prefer to do. He's probably right anyhow. What do I know?"
"LORELAI: Did he know all the work you put into this?"
"EMILY: It's really not important, Lorelai. I do this for your father. I have done this for your father for the last 36 years. If he thinks that Jason's right, then it's fine with me. And after all, now I don't have to worry about a party. I can just relax and hang out."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Anyhow, I have to go. I'm wasting all my hanging-out time sitting here talking about this silly party. Send me those receipts and I'll get you a check."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, great."
"EMILY: Apologize to Sookie for me, will you?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"EMILY: We'll see you girls Friday night."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Kirk and Lulu are still on their date]"
"LULU: [laughs] Oh, my gosh, that's so funny. That's amazing, you sound just like him."
"[Luke watches them for a moment, then starts making some coffee. Kirk comes up behind him]"
"KIRK: Luke."
"LUKE: [startled] Jeez! Kirk, what are you doing?"
"KIRK: I need your help."
"LUKE: I'm filling the coffee here."
"KIRK: Look behind me."
"LUKE: What am I looking at, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Is she still there?"
"LUKE: Who?"
"KIRK: Lulu. Is Lulu still there?"
"LUKE: You mean your date?"
"KIRK: Yes, Lulu, my date. Who else would I mean? Catch up, man. Time is of the essence."
"LUKE: Yes, she's still there."
"KIRK: Are you sure?"
"LUKE: Yes, I'm sure, now get out from behind my counter."
"KIRK: I don't know what to do."
"LUKE: What are you talking about? I just looked over there and everything seemed fine."
"KIRK: Exactly. Everything seemed fine."
"LUKE: So?"
"KIRK: Doesn't that seem weird to you?"
"LUKE: No."
"KIRK: Really?"
"LUKE: Yes, a little, but so what? Why question it? Go back over there."
"KIRK: I can't. I don't understand what's happening. I mean, she was looking at me. Directly at me. At first I thought I had something on my lip, but I brushed and brushed and nothing. She was just looking at me."
"LUKE: Well, that's good."
"KIRK: And I have prepared several small-talk subjects for the evening and I haven't used one of them."
"LUKE: You're making too much of this."
"KIRK: This is not how it's supposed to go. I'm supposed to take her out, we're supposed to exhaust my prepared subjects immediately, and then the minute I get up and go to the bathroom, she is supposed to sneak out and leave me here humiliated. Now I have been to the bathroom three times, and I have to tell you, I did not have to go, and every time I came back to the table, she was there and she was smiling, and. . .hey, did you see her touch my arm? What the hell was that all about?"
"LUKE: I think that means she likes you."
"KIRK: Shut up! You take that back!"
"LUKE: Kirk, Kirk, I am not gonna fight with you over you not believing that this girl likes you because, to be honest with you, I'm a little fuzzy on the ""why"" myself, but the bottom line is she does."
"KIRK: She does?"
"LUKE: Yes, she's laughing and smiling, and buckle up, cowboy, because I think she might actually touch you again."
"KIRK: You think?"
"LUKE: There's a frightening chance she might, so my advice to you is to go back over there and continue doing what you've been doing."
"KIRK: I was doing my Jon Cryer from ""Pretty in Pink"" impression."
"LUKE: Duckie?"
"KIRK: Yes, Duckie."
"LUKE: Were you near the end of the movie yet?"
"KIRK: No, just getting to the ""Try a Little Tenderness"" moment."
"LUKE: You've got plenty of a*mo left. Go on. Go back over there."
"KIRK: You think she likes me?"
"LUKE: I think she likes you."
"KIRK: You think she likes me."
"LUKE: God help us one and all."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting at the kitchen table. Sookie is throwing away the broccoli tarts]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Uh, no, just leave another message that I called. Thank you. [hangs up]"
"SOOKIE: Number 42, see ya."
"LORELAI: You don't have to throw them all out, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: I didn't. I've got twenty in the freezer."
"LORELAI: Great."
"SOOKIE: And so do you."
"LORELAI: Even better."
"SOOKIE: I already had that money spent. It was going towards a down payment on a safer car. Now little Davey will have to fend for himself rolling around in the back of Daddy's truck."
"RORY: [entering the house] Mom?"
"LORELAI: Kitchen."
"SOOKIE: ""Hold on, Davey! Daddy's coming to a sudden stop."""
"LORELAI: You're being dramatic."
"SOOKIE: But I'm so disappointed. I mean, all that planning, all that time, all that broccoli."
"[Rory walks into the kitchen]"
"RORY: I lost my tree."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: My tree, my study tree - it's gone. Someone stole it."
"SOOKIE: Someone stole a tree?"
"RORY: No, the tree's still there, but when I went there today, there was this guy sitting there reading trucking magazines and he would not give it up, so now I'm back where I started."
"LORELAI: You'll figure something out."
"RORY: Yes, I will figure out what my alternate profession will be because now I can't study, I'm gonna flunk out of Yale and I'm gonna have to give up all hope of being a foreign correspondent. This sucks."
"SOOKIE: You're telling me? I'm eating broccoli tarts for the next four years."
"RORY: Well, what am I gonna do?"
"LORELAI: You are gonna suck it up."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You're in college now, Rory. If your study plan doesn't work, then come up with another one. Just figure it out, but stop complaining because you're not two. And Sookie, in pioneer times, kids traveled across the country in covered wagons and survived. Somehow I think little Davey will live without his minivan."
"RORY: Mom, why are you mad?"
"LORELAI: I have something I have to do. I'll be back in a little while. And have these damn tarts out of here by the time I get home!"
"SOOKIE: Grab a fork."
"CUT TO JASON'S OFFICE"
"[Jason is talking to his secretary when Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Well, hello, Digger Stiles."
"JASON: Lorelai Gilmore, you sure grew up good."
"LORELAI: Oh, did I, Digger? Thanks. Listen, why didn't you return my calls?"
"JASON: 'Cause I hadn't seen you yet."
"LORELAI: Four times. You never called me back."
"JASON: I'll call you back now. What's your number?"
"LORELAI: 976-bite-me."
"JASON: Okay, did you get that, Ms. Lomay? Because I know how much you like having numbers in your files."
"LORELAI: We need to talk."
"JASON: In my office?"
"LORELAI: Great."
"JASON: [to his secretary] You know what? You can go."
"SECRETARY: All right. Goodnight, Mr. Stiles."
"JASON: Goodnight. [to Lorelai] Would you like something to drink?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, thanks."
"JASON: So how you been?"
"LORELAI: Great. You?"
"JASON: No complaints."
"LORELAI: Okay, small talk over. I want you to know something - you can't just waltz into people's lives and take over."
"JASON: I don't waltz at all. It's embarrassing and a little gay."
"LORELAI: You know, people were hired for this party, people who were counting on this money."
"JASON: What party?"
"LORELAI: Launch party."
"JASON: Oh, that."
"LORELAI: Yes, that. And I want to tell you something else - my mother has been planning these stupid parties for years, and it was completely out of line for you to walk in there and just crap all over the whole thing and make her feel obsolete and useless."
"JASON: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on there. I never knew about the party. They never told me about the party."
"LORELAI: Well, of course they never told you about the party because they're inconsiderate and self-centered, and they have been that way for many years, so they have dibs. But the minute you found out about the party, you should have canceled your plans."
"JASON: It was too late for that. And I never called your mother obsolete, I just called cocktail parties obsolete."
"LORELAI: Same thing."
"JASON: I don't see how."
"LORELAI: Jason, my mother is a corporate wife. Her job is putting these parties on, and you put her out of work. You know that, your mother does the same thing. Imagine if you took these functions away from her. What would she have left?"
"JASON: More time with the pool boy?"
"LORELAI: You embarrassed my mother and made her feel small. You unceremoniously canceled something she had been working on for days."
"JASON: But I didn't know."
"LORELAI: And then she had to come to my house and fire me!"
"JASON: Fire you? Why would she fire you?"
"LORELAI: Because I was the caterer."
"JASON: Get out of town!"
"LORELAI: Yes, I have a partner in a small catering company."
"JASON: You cook?"
"LORELAI: I plan."
"JASON: Well, I had no idea how much chaos my little weekend was causing."
"LORELAI: No, you didn't, because you didn't think. You never thought. Back in summer camp, you never thought. ""Hey, if I stand up in this canoe, maybe it'll tip over."" That was the extent of your thought process."
"JASON: You're still mad about that."
"LORELAI: I was fully dressed."
"JASON: I remember - green T-shirt, no bra."
"LORELAI: What?"
"JASON: Trust me, I was the hero of cabin five for the rest of the summer."
"LORELAI: You will apologize to my mother."
"JASON: Absolutely."
"LORELAI: And you will let her throw that party."
"JASON: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Digger!"
"JASON: Umlauts! The party is off. Now this is business. I will apologize to Emily, but that is the best I can do."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you just called me Umlauts."
"JASON: You called me Digger three times before I called you Umlauts once. I think that shows great self-control."
"LORELAI: Let my mother have her party!"
"JASON: No, I can't do it, but what I can do is take you out to dinner tomorrow night."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, how do those two thoughts even coincide?"
"JASON: You'd have to be in my head, but trust me, there was a track."
"LORELAI: I am not having dinner with you."
"JASON: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because you just had me fired. You just insulted my mother."
"JASON: It's interesting, I didn't know you and your mother were so close."
"LORELAI: We're not."
"JASON: You're being awfully protective of her."
"LORELAI: Well, every family has a Fredo."
"JASON: Yeah, and Fredo's family put two in the back of his head."
"LORELAI: My relationship with my mother is none of your business."
"JASON: Then have dinner with me."
"LORELAI: No!"
"JASON: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because."
"JASON: Because your mother would hate it."
"LORELAI: Yes, my mother would hate it. A lot. You suck."
"CUT TO YALE"
"[Rory walks up to the study tree, where the same guy is reading under it]"
"RORY: Excuse me. Remember me?"
"GUY: I got here first."
"RORY: I know. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry about the other day. I got a little wound up because I do that sometimes. I get too structured and too serious and I just have to adjust, you know, because we're in college and college is about change, and you have my study tree, so yeah, I just. . .I have to be okay with that and just learn to kind of go with the flow. So I just wanted to tell you that, and I'm sorry if I interrupted you again."
"GUY: That's okay."
"RORY: I'll give you twenty bucks for the tree."
"GUY: You're gonna pay me for the tree?"
"RORY: Go with the flow, man."
"GUY: You're on."
"[He takes the money and leaves. Rory sits down under the tree and starts to study]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting at the kitchen table clipping coupons. Rory walks out of her bedroom carrying a bag of laundry, and Lorelai hides the coupons.]"
"LORELAI: Morning."
"RORY: Morning."
"LORELAI: Hey, would you be horrified if I started clipping coupons again?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, then, I won't."
"RORY: Wait, did you say again?"
"LORELAI: I meant ever."
"RORY: When did you clip coupons before?"
"LORELAI: I didn't. I misspoke. Whoops."
"RORY: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: Hey, how is it that your dirty laundry has increased exponentially since you started Yale?"
"RORY: 'Cause I'm a dirty, filthy Yale girl now. [she grabs the page of coupons from the table]"
"LORELAI: I told you I'm not gonna clip them!"
"RORY: Then I don't see the problem."
"LORELAI: Just for the Fig Newtons, please!"
"[Rory opens the back door and listens to the music coming from the garage]"
"RORY: Whoa! That is -"
"LORELAI: Sucks."
"RORY: That is totally sucks. And they're like on their two hundredth guitarist audition."
"LORELAI: Well, they must be down to the deaf, dumb, and blind ones. Ah, he found it."
"RORY: Found what?"
"LORELAI: The lost chord."
"RORY: So, the washer's broken."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: You didn't mention that when you saw me walk out with my exponential amounts of laundry."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: Or when I called from Yale to say that I had exponential amounts of laundry to do."
"LORELAI: You've totally co-opted my word."
"RORY: Okay, plethora - that's my word. I have a plethora of dirty laundry and nowhere to do it."
"LORELAI: But you don't come home to do your laundry. You come home to see your mama."
"RORY: No, this time I came home to do my laundry."
"LORELAI: All right. I'll call the repairman A.S.A.P."
"RORY: Hey, you hear that?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: No music."
"LORELAI: And the band stopped playing, too."
"[Lane walks in through the back door]"
"RORY: Hi, Lane."
"LORELAI: How's it going there?"
"[Lane walks to the sink, turns the faucet on, and sticks her head under the water.]"
"RORY: You think she can hear us?"
"LORELAI: I think out of self-defense her ears have become vestigial organs."
"[Lane walks back outside. Rory grabs another page of coupons from the table.]"
"LORELAI: I'm not clipping coupons!"
"RORY: Then I don't see the problem."
"[Lorelai finds another page of coupons on the table]"
"LORELAI: Ha."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, it's your friendly neighborhood Lorelai."
"SOOKIE: I'm in the kitchen!"
"[There's a man sitting in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Good morning."
"BEAU: Is it?"
"SOOKIE: Just spreading that love and sunshine around, huh, buddy? Lorelai, this is Beau, Jackson's brother. Beau, this is our friend Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"BEAU: Hm."
"SOOKIE: Come on. Let's leave Oscar Wilde here to his reading."
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk to the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: What's with the 'tude?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson asked Beau to be here for the birth."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"SOOKIE: Which was supposed to happen a week ago."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"SOOKIE: So Beau's missing way more work than he thought he would, and he's letting me know it."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it would be nice if God gave us women a pop-up thing when a baby's done like on a turkey, but he chose not to. Hey, Jackson."
"JACKSON: Hi. This extra time is great, huh? I'm getting so much done."
"SOOKIE: I know. I'm still storing meals. I've got two weeks worth."
"BEAU: Hey, Jackson?"
"JACKSON: Yeah, Beau?"
"BEAU: What day is it today?"
"JACKSON: It's Saturday, Beau."
"BEAU: I get time and a half on Saturdays."
"JACKSON: Uh huh."
"BEAU: It gets me my fun things. Otherwise, it's all just bill paying."
"JACKSON: [to Sookie] Have I apologized to you enough?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, Daddy, you have."
"JACKSON: So, I got the plastic sheet on the bed. It fits perfectly."
"SOOKIE: Excellent."
"LORELAI: What's that for?"
"JACKSON: She doesn't know?"
"LORELAI: Know about what?"
"SOOKIE: You ready? This is big. It's really good, and I want you to slowly drink it in. No big gulps."
"LORELAI: I'm ready to take a sip."
"SOOKIE: We're skipping the hospital and having the baby here."
"LORELAI: Here in your house?"
"SOOKIE: In our bed."
"LORELAI: Hence the sheet."
"JACKSON: Got a honey of a sheet. It's the top of the line. The little thing will come out and carom right down into the catcher's arms."
"LORELAI: While we all yell, ""hey, batter, batter, batter""?"
"SOOKIE: He means the midwife. Got the best one on the eastern seaboard."
"JACKSON: You look mystified."
"LORELAI: No, it's just. . .uh, you guys have done a lot of research on this, right?"
"SOOKIE: Millions of babies have been born this way."
"JACKSON: It's a great tradition."
"SOOKIE: And hospitals are so cold, you know, so full of infections."
"JACKSON: And dead people."
"SOOKIE: And sometimes the dead people have infections."
"JACKSON: And if they're not dead yet, they die."
"LORELAI: All true."
"JACKSON: But the best thing about having little Davey or Colgate here - zero chance of bringing home the wrong baby. What comes out of her here, stays here. Oh, I got something for you. [hands Lorelai a pager] It's a baby pager. It'll go off when Sookie's close."
"[""The Entertainer"" plays from the pager]"
"LORELAI: Oh, cute."
"JACKSON: Scott Joplin seemed appropriately sunny."
"SOOKIE: I want you to be here even if home birth disgusts you."
"LORELAI: Of course I'll be here. Nothing could keep me away."
"JACKSON: Ohh! Extra buckets - I gotta put it on the list."
"LORELAI: Extra buckets? What's that. . .hm. Never mind."
"CUT TO THE DANCE STUDIO"
"[Townspeople are gathering for a town meeting]"
"KIRK: Excuse me. Can my girlfriend and I sit here? This is my girlfriend."
"LULU: Hi."
"MAN: Hi."
"KIRK: My girlfriend and I appreciate it."
"LULU: Yes, thank you."
"KIRK: I got a pretty polite girlfriend."
"BABETTE: Should we be nervous about this?"
"ANDREW: I don't know. Did Taylor tell anyone why he called an emergency meeting?"
"KIRK: He said nothing to me or my girlfriend."
"MISS PATTY: I can't remember the last town emergency meeting he called."
"KIRK: Me and my girlfriend can't either."
"RORY: Home birth?"
"LORELAI: I was horrified and I hid it horribly. I wanted to be supportive but throw up at the same time."
"RORY: A plastic sheet?"
"LORELAI: I saw it. It was the same one that boy who couldn't hold it had to use in that after-school special. What was that called?"
"RORY: ""It's Not Benny's Fault."""
"LORELAI: Oh, God. It was so insane. It's what hospitals are for."
"KIRK: Hey, Lane, there's a seat behind my girlfriend."
"LANE: That's okay, Kirk. Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Hey."
"LANE: Get this. I just found the most amazing guitarist - a phenom. He was cool on the phone, and we're meeting him tomorrow."
"RORY: That's great."
"LANE: I'm trying not to get my hopes up, but I've already figured out that our Spin cover should be against a bloodred backdrop with a skull hovering over us."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, very Norman Rockwell."
"RORY: That woman's staring at me."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mrs. Van-uppity? Well, maybe you're just her type."
"TAYLOR: People, thank you for assembling on such short notice."
"BABETTE: What's up, Taylor?"
"KIRK: My girlfriend was wondering that, too."
"TAYLOR: As you know, every year, one lucky town in Connecticut gets to host ""The Festival of Living Pictures,"" a show which presents onstage recreations of famous works of art - statues, paintings, et cetera, with real people posing as the figures in the art. We hosted it seven years ago - successfully, I might add."
"BABETTE: Yeah, it was a blast."
"LORELAI: Definitely."
"KIRK: My girlfriend's gonna love this."
"TAYLOR: The town of Woodbury was supposed to host it this year, but because of recent flooding, they canceled at the last minute, and I offered Stars Hollow to be the host. How does that sound?"
"RORY: Cool."
"BABETTE: Yeah, sign us up."
"MISS PATTY: Yeah, Taylor, you finally did something right. Your beard is so sexy."
"ANDREW: How much time do we have?"
"TAYLOR: One week. And as per tradition, we need to come up with one original recreation to go with all the others that are in the show every year."
"MISS PATTY: Well, that's not a lot of time."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Taylor, is it even possible?"
"TAYLOR: Well, it'll have to be. I've already assured Hank, who is the Taylor Doose of Woodbury, that we'd take it over successfully. It's a challenge, people, but doable. Now, I would like to introduce you to a key player in our execution of this endeavor, the head of the Connecticut Arts Council, Buff Otis."
"LORELAI: Hey, it's your future wife."
"RORY: Shut up."
"TAYLOR: Would you like to say a few words, Mrs. Otis?"
"MRS. OTIS: Your enthusiasm. . .shocks me."
"LORELAI: Is that good?"
"RORY: Hard to tell."
"LANE: It might be."
"BABETTE: Scary broad."
"TAYLOR: I will be managing the event and emceeing. Uh, Miss Patty, you will be stage-managing. Uh, Lorelai, if you could help organize the costumes?"
"LORELAI: I'm here for you and your sexy beard, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Um, everyone should sign up now if you want to be considered to be cast in one of the recreations. Mrs. Otis and I will make the final decisions."
"BABETTE: Hey, you're gonna be the girl in that Renoir painting again, right? You were such a doll in that."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure I can be persuaded."
"TAYLOR: This is an enormous challenge, people, but I say we do it and do it well. Meeting adjourned."
"LORELAI: Wait."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: I want to see if she asks you out."
"RORY: Ugh."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: I wonder if I want to be something other than the Renoir girl."
"RORY: I'm sorry, the audience has come to expect you in the role of Renoir girl. You can't disappoint them. It's a plum role."
"LORELAI: True, true."
"LUKE: Sorry I took so long. I was dealing with more divorce-lawyer stuff."
"LORELAI: Good Lord, is Nicole's lawyer still harassing you?"
"LUKE: No, mine was. And please don't point out the irony of my paying a lawyer to work for me."
"LORELAI: Okay, but then you're gonna owe me something else I can ironically comment on."
"LUKE: Fine. Hey, what was that emergency meeting all about?"
"RORY: We're hosting ""The Festival of Living Pictures"" again."
"LUKE: Oh, joy."
"LORELAI: His lack of enthusiasm shocks me."
"LUKE: You're involving yourself in this thing? It's such a stupid waste of time."
"LORELAI: I just thought of the perfect painting for Luke to be in. ""Cranky Guy in Baseball Cap."""
"RORY: Was that Manet or Monet?"
"LORELAI: That was mustard on my hamburger and a side of fries, please."
"RORY: She's the queen of segues."
"LUKE: She's the queen of something. You want your usual?"
"RORY: Yes, please. Maybe I'll just be a backstage person this year. There's less pressure. You don't have to get made up, and. . .[sees Taylor and Mrs. Otis staring at her through the diner window] What are they doing?"
"LORELAI: Well, I bet she's coming to -"
"RORY: Hey, and no more inappropriate lesbian references, please."
"LORELAI: All right. Oh, you know what? I bet you're in line for the new painting they're cooking up."
"RORY: I feel like a used car."
"TAYLOR: Turn to the side."
"RORY: What?"
"TAYLOR: Turn to the side. We need to see your profile."
"LORELAI: Just what I thought."
"RORY: This is a violation of my civil rights."
"LORELAI: You better do what John Ashcroft says or they may just follow us home."
"RORY: Unbelievable."
"TAYLOR: Other way. Other way."
"RORY: I'm a Yale student, for God's sake."
"TAYLOR: Thank you."
"RORY: Crazy, doofus town."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"CUT TO THE DANCE STUDIO"
"TAYLOR: Let's not loiter around the cast sheets, people. Find your name and then move on."
"ANDREW: Oh, cool. I'm gonna be some statue."
"TAYLOR: You're ""The Reaper,"" Andrew - a prize work at Versailles and a prize role, not some statue."
"ANDREW: So I get to be painted all white, huh?"
"TAYLOR: Yes, that's what that means."
"LORELAI: Hi, Taylor. When are the costumes getting here?"
"TAYLOR: Hank in Woodbury swears they're en route, but you gotta double and triple-check with that guy."
"LORELAI: Hank's the you in Woodbury."
"TAYLOR: A real ninny. He's praying we don't pull this off, but that only inspires me to work harder."
"KIRK: I need to see the list."
"JOE: Watch the elbows, Kirk."
"KIRK: I just need to see the list."
"MISS PATTY: He's going to be very happy."
"KIRK: Woohoo!"
"LORELAI: What'd you get, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Christ in ""The Last Supper."""
"LORELAI: The big kahuna."
"KIRK: I'm gonna do it right, too. Lots of research. What's a good book to read?"
"LORELAI: Uh, the bible?"
"KIRK: Right. Yo, where are my apostles? Where are my homeboys? James, son of Alpheus, give me five."
"JOE: All right."
"KIRK: Simon, the Canaanite, don't leave me hanging. I say we go celebrate. How 'bout Shakey's?"
"MAN: All right."
"JOE: Cool."
"MISS PATTY: That is one happy Christ."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it was nice of you guys to give him that."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, I wanted to show you this. It's our original picture. Well, we think Rory would be perfect for it. It's called ""Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea."""
"LORELAI: Wow, that's Rory."
"MISS PATTY: Do you think she'll do it?"
"LORELAI: Well, you got some sway with me."
"MISS PATTY: Good, good."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm confused."
"MISS PATTY: I should go make my calls."
"LORELAI: I'm not the, uh, Renoir girl."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, really? I didn't realize that. . ."
"LORELAI: Patty, I'm the spitting image of the Renoir girl. I played her seven years ago and received the proper accolades. This is a mistake."
"MISS PATTY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Um, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Yes, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: I'm not listed as the Renoir girl. Is that a mistake?"
"TAYLOR: Frankly, no, it's not."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm not listed as anything else, either."
"TAYLOR: That's also correct. You'll be helping with costumes."
"LORELAI: I don't get it. Why am I not the Renoir girl? I'm the spitting image."
"TAYLOR: You are. Your look is perfect."
"LORELAI: Then why am I not the Renoir girl?"
"TAYLOR: I really have to tell you why?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you do."
"TAYLOR: You flinched."
"LORELAI: I what?"
"TAYLOR: Seven years ago, the curtain opened. You were posed in the painting, then you flinched noticeably."
"LORELAI: I did not flinch."
"TAYLOR: We thought you were having an attack."
"LORELAI: I did not flinch!"
"TAYLOR: You almost knocked Terrence over."
"LORELAI: I did not!"
"TAYLOR: The whole town saw it. And with Hank from Woodbury looking over my shoulder, I'm not taking any risks."
"LORELAI: Patty, please, back me up here."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, honey, I'm sorry, you flinched!"
"TAYLOR: Big-time."
"MISS PATTY: You almost knocked Terrence over."
"TAYLOR: Yeah, you screwed the pooch, so you're out. I'm sorry."
"MISS PATTY: So, you'll ask Rory about the painting?"
"CUT TO THE YALE LAUNDRY ROOM"
"[Lorelai and Rory are ding laundry]"
"LORELAI: It's humiliating!"
"RORY: You and the Renoir girl - it was a lock."
"LORELAI: Yeah, until this smear campaign. There's a lot of tension in the air here."
"RORY: Well, it's midterms."
"LORELAI: You seem calm."
"RORY: Well, on the outside. Is this what you're using, Dream Fresh laundry powder?"
"LORELAI: It's a new brand."
"RORY: It's an off-brand."
"LORELAI: It leaves your clothes with that Dream-Fresh scent."
"RORY: You used a coupon, didn't you?"
"LORELAI: Thirty-five cents off or not, I still would have chosen Dream Fresh."
"RORY: So, who'd they pick for the Renoir girl?"
"LORELAI: Carol Dandridge."
"RORY: Carol Dandridge?"
"LORELAI: Carol Dandruff from now on!"
"RORY: Okay, now, don't take it out on poor Carol. It's not like she lobbied for it."
"LORELAI: I bet she did. That would be just like that old porky, doody-dridge."
"RORY: Oh, wow. You're really bummed about this, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: On the outside, I am a mature adult who's able to put setbacks like this in their proper place, and on the inside, I just wanna wear that pretty dress again!"
"RORY: You will."
"LORELAI: Yeah, if a brick lands on Taylor's head and he suddenly likes me again. Ooh, a brick."
"RORY: You don't need a brick. You have me. I'll take care of it."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: You are going to be the Renoir girl - end of story."
"LORELAI: How?"
"RORY: Well, if they want an Anthea for ""Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea,"" then they're going to have to have you for the Renoir girl."
"LORELAI: Well, look at you folding your laundry all haughty and powerful."
"RORY: Bada-bing all over his nice ivy-league suit."
"LORELAI: Rory, you couldn't do that. Come on. It would be embarrassing, it would be manipulative, and can you do it tonight?"
"RORY: I think I'll wait until the Anthea costume is perfectly fitted to my specifications. Then we won't have no surprises."
"LORELAI: I am in awe."
"RORY: Pass me the Dream Fresh?"
"LORELAI: I wouldn't dare not to."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S GARAGE"
"[The band is setting up]"
"LANE: I don't know about you, but I'm completely jazzed about this."
"ZACH: This is the first time I've been excited about playing since Dave."
"BRIAN: If he's half as good as this tape, I'm gonna plotz."
"[A man enters the garage]"
"LANE: Can we help you?"
"GIL: Yeah, I'm looking for Lane."
"LANE: I'm Lane."
"GIL: Am I late?"
"LANE: For?"
"GIL: The audition."
"LANE: For?"
"GIL: I'm Gil!"
"ZACH: Gil."
"BRIAN: Gil."
"LANE: Gil. No, you're right on time. Come on in."
"GIL: Primo space."
"ZACH: Yeah."
"BRIAN: Primo."
"GIL: How you guys doin'?"
"BRIAN: I'm Brian."
"ZACH: Zach."
"GIL: Where do you guys want me?"
"LANE: Uh, right there's good."
"GIL: Cool."
"CUT TO THE TOWN SQUARE"
"[A tent has been set up for the costume fittings for the festival]"
"LORELAI: How's your research coming along, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Good, although I got off to a slow start. I didn't realize Jesus wasn't in the Old Testament 'til I hit page 368."
"LORELAI: Hey, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Hello."
"LORELAI: I took a quick survey of the costumes. Looks like everything's here and accounted for."
"TAYLOR: And the Renoir girl dress still fits you?"
"LORELAI: Like a glove."
"TAYLOR: So help me, if you make me look bad in front of Hank from Woodbury, there is gonna be hell to pay. Sorry."
"TROUBADOUR: Hey, I'm here for a fitting."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, you've come to the right place. What are you in?"
"TROUBADOUR: ""The Last Supper."""
"KIRK: Oh, you must be one of my missing apostles. Still haven't met them all. I'm Christ."
"TROUBADOUR: It's gonna be a lot of fun, huh?"
"KIRK: Definitely. Which apostle are you?"
"TROUBADOUR: Judas."
"KIRK: Judas."
"TROUBADOUR: So, uh, where do I go for my fitting?"
"KIRK: Oh, I think you know where you're going, pal."
"LORELAI: Right through that flap. I'll meet you back there."
"TROUBADOUR: Thanks. So I heard you and all the apostles are going to Shakey's later."
"KIRK: You heard wrong, friend. We're not going to Shakey's."
"TROUBADOUR: Oh, okay. Well, maybe some other time."
"KIRK: Yeah, some other time."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S GARAGE"
"[The band is playing a song with Gil]"
"GIL: Man, you guys are fantastic!"
"ZACH: Uh, yeah, you, too."
"BRIAN: Yeah."
"LANE: Really good, Gil."
"GIL: I mean it's tight, you know. It feels right."
"LANE: Definitely."
"ZACH: It's got a feel that. . ."
"LANE: Feels right."
"BRIAN: Yeah."
"GIL: You want to do another one?"
"LANE: Sure."
"GIL: Just give me one minute to call work. I own a sandwich shop in Salisbury and I gotta check in every once in a while or it's chaos. I'll be right back. Awesome, guys! Really!"
"LANE: Back at ya!"
"[Gil walks out of the garage]"
"ZACH: Whoa."
"LANE: Yeah."
"BRIAN: He's. . .he's. . ."
"ZACH: Old. Just say it, dude. Grandpa's old."
"LANE: He's not a grandpa."
"BRIAN: Did you know how old he was?"
"LANE: He sounded young on the phone."
"ZACH: Right here, he's got some lines. That blows my mind."
"BRIAN: What is he, late thirties?"
"ZACH: Approaching forty."
"LANE: Forty?"
"BRIAN: He was alive before man walked on the moon."
"ZACH: Don't do that, man. You're freaking me out."
"LANE: Let's not be over-dramatic, guys. I mean, he is an incredible guitarist."
"ZACH: He's had a lot of time to practice."
"BRIAN: And the bicentennial - he was alive for that."
"LANE: This is the best we've sounded since Dave, and he's really -"
"ZACH: Elderly."
"LANE: Excited."
"BRIAN: He was our age when we were born."
"LANE: He thinks we're great"
"BRIAN: There were no cd's when he was born."
"ZACH: Stop it, man. I mean it."
"LANE: Maybe there's a way to offset his oldness. Put a hat on him. Dress him up like Angus Young in AC/DC - that schoolboy outfit."
"BRIAN: He could have seen AC/DC with their original lead singer."
"ZACH: And 1980 is when that guy choked on his own vomit. That's old."
"LANE: You want to stop the audition?"
"BRIAN: We shouldn't be rude."
"LANE: Good."
"ZACH: Fine, we'll keep going, but remember, any new member has to be approved by all of us. So one vote against, and he's back at bingo."
"LANE: I know."
"[Gil walks back in]"
"GIL: [on phone] Cindy knows where the extra prosciutto is, Kevin. Ask her. Come on, I've told you before, when I'm not there, Cindy is me, okay? I'll check in later. Bye. [hangs up] Kids, man. In one ear and out the other. Okay, come on. Let's rock!"
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"JACKSON: Hi."
"LORELAI: Ooh, balloons! Sad, little, droopy balloons."
"JACKSON: We got 'em too soon."
"LORELAI: Oh. Hey, you feeling okay?"
"SOOKIE: Fine. Bruce just suggested a little afternoon rest."
"LORELAI: Bruce? Who's he?"
"JACKSON: She."
"SOOKIE: It's a last name."
"LORELAI: Who's she?"
"JACKSON: Best midwife on the eastern seaboard."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"BEAU: [on phone] Uh-huh. So it's gonna be another fifty bucks to change the flight again? That's six and a half hours take-home after taxes, disability, and FICA."
"SOOKIE: And the Oscar for biggest blubber baby goes to. . ."
"BEAU: [on phone] No, no, go ahead. Put me down for it. I got no choice. Thanks. [hangs up] She sounded hot."
"SOOKIE: Hey, Beau, why don't you go take a little walk? You know, go do something."
"JACKSON: Yeah, good idea."
"BEAU: But there's nothing to do in this hick town, not like back in Bogalusa."
"JACKSON: Hey, Beau, why don't you come help me pick the zucchini in the back? I got a couple of giant Miracle Gro ones out there. Huh? It'll tickle you."
"BEAU: That might be something."
"[Jackson and Beau leave]"
"LORELAI: Wow, you can cut the sexual tension with a knife."
"SOOKIE: Ugh! Don't joke."
"BRUCE: The bedroom is now prepared for the baby. Your husband tried, but he screwed up, so I fixed it."
"SOOKIE: Thank you, Bruce."
"BRUCE: There's someone new here."
"SOOKIE: Oh, Bruce, this is my best friend I was telling you about, Lorelai."
"BRUCE: Hello."
"LORELAI: Hi, oh, hey. I heard you were the, uh, best midwife on the eastern seaboard. May I call you Bruce?"
"BRUCE: Everyone does."
"LORELAI: Then I will call you Bruce."
"BRUCE: You're anti-midwife."
"LORELAI: Pardon me?"
"BRUCE: There's anti-midwife energy in this room and it wasn't here when I left it."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it's not coming from me."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, Bruce, Lorelai is pro-you, all the way."
"BRUCE: Uh huh. I'll be in the bedroom."
"LORELAI: Uh, wow, that woman's got strong hands."
"SOOKIE: She ate a whole jar of crunchy peanut butter in one sitting."
"LORELAI: I would want a woman just like that yanking the baby out of me."
"BRUCE: Please lay on your side, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, sorry. This is the position I'm going to be in for the baby. She wants me to get used to it."
"BRUCE: Less tearing this way."
"LORELAI: Ohh, smack that image right out of my head."
"BRUCE: I beg your pardon?"
"SOOKIE: Hey, you know, Bruce spent two years in China educating poor villagers on female issues."
"LORELAI: Oh, I hear they got great Chinese food there."
"SOOKIE: A card."
"BRUCE: You're the friend who's going to be there, right?"
"LORELAI: With rings on my fingers and bells on my toes."
"BRUCE: You'll leave the negativity at home?"
"LORELAI: Bruce, I swear, I am Miss Positivity."
"BRUCE: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: I swear, I am not anti-midwife. I mean, that would be as dumb as being, I don't know, anti-best friend. Don't you think?"
"BRUCE: Uh huh."
"[Jackson and Beau walk back in]"
"BEAU: You're the one who asked me out to pick zucchinis."
"JACKSON: Right. Pick them, not kick them."
"BEAU: You used to be fun. Now you're just a big-city phony."
"BRUCE: Beau!"
"BEAU: Huh?"
"BRUCE: What did I say before?"
"BEAU: I wasn't listening."
"BRUCE: The baby will come when the baby comes. We're all here to serve the baby. Jackson!"
"JACKSON: What?"
"BRUCE: How are you serving the baby?"
"JACKSON: I could go get more balloons?"
"BRUCE: Good. And, Beau, how are you serving the baby?"
"BEAU: I could help Jackson with balloons."
"BRUCE: You need two men for that?"
"BEAU: I could get. . .I could get flowers."
"BRUCE: Good!"
"JACKSON: Okay, we're going to get balloons and flowers."
"LORELAI: She didn't give me any instructions."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Should I move?"
"SOOKIE: I wouldn't yet."
""
""
""
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are walking down the street]"
"SOOKIE: This is nice."
"LORELAI: It is a beautiful day."
"SOOKIE: Good suggestion."
"LORELAI: You think Bruce was just trying to get rid of us?"
"SOOKIE: You, yes. But Bruce is there for the baby, and I've got the baby."
"LORELAI: Have you checked that recently?"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Are you sure she hasn't taken the baby and shoved a pillow under there when you weren't looking?"
"ANDREW: Oh my God!"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"ANDREW: You haven't popped yet."
"SOOKIE: Not yet."
"ANDREW: It's like an elephant's gestation."
"SOOKIE: Thanks for the very welcome perspective on that, Andrew."
"LORELAI: Hey, how's the research going, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Good. I'm using the clothing to get into character and I've been focusing on historical foods. Christ ate a lot of lentils."
"LORELAI: No utensils back then?"
"KIRK: No, they had utensils."
"TAYLOR: This is a disaster, an unmitigated disaster!"
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"TAYLOR: We're missing half the table for ""The Last Supper."""
"LORELAI: Drag."
"TAYLOR: This is Hank from Woodbury's doing. That little fink only shipped half the table on purpose."
"MISS PATTY: No, I just talked to him, Taylor, and he swears he shipped everything they had."
"LORELAI: Well, let's think here. There's gotta be a way to do this."
"SOOKIE: Just add a card table to the end or some TV trays. It'll be like a funky Last Supper."
"TAYLOR: ""The Last Supper"" cannot be funky."
"MISS PATTY: Or we could just make do with what we have and crowd all the apostles around it."
"ANDREW: Or eliminate some of the apostles."
"TAYLOR: This is not going to work. I think we're just gonna have to throw in the towel."
"MISS PATTY: Well, I think you might be right, Taylor. This just might be a sign to pack it in."
"ANDREW: So no festival?"
"TAYLOR: No festival."
"SOOKIE: I have to keep moving."
"TAYLOR: Okay, start packing it up, people."
"KIRK: You would fold?"
"TAYLOR: What was that, Kirk?"
"KIRK: You would fold due simply to hardship?"
"TAYLOR: Not now, Kirk. Uh, keep everything where it is, guys. No reason to unload it just to load it again."
"KIRK: Would you follow blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, that's your blood sugar talking, sweetie. Eat a candy bar."
"KIRK: This is but a crisis of faith."
"TAYLOR: I said not now, Kirk."
"ANDREW: Let him talk. What's the harm?"
"KIRK: When the road to your destination is revealed to be long and dusty, is your destination's value so diminished?"
"TAYLOR: Well, I suppose not, but still -"
"KIRK: If a storm mars your camp for the night, is it wise to search for high ground or hold your camp 'til the light of new day?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, it's something to think about."
"KIRK: A crisis of faith can be delivered, but one must believe to be delivered."
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk over to Luke]"
"LUKE: No way am I building that table out for them, no way."
"LORELAI: Anyone ask you to, Jose?"
"LUKE: Nope, but they're going to."
"LORELAI: They'll just get Tom to do it."
"LUKE: The contractor? No, he's too busy with his own stuff. You having twins?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LUKE: You sure?"
"SOOKIE: Uh, let me think about it for another millisecond - no!"
"LUKE: It looks like you're having twins."
"SOOKIE: You're gonna make me fall in love with you, Luke."
"LUKE: It would take me hours."
"LORELAI: What would?"
"LUKE: The table. It's gotta be built out in forced perspective. It's complicated."
"LORELAI: Throw a stick and you can find someone to fix that table."
"LUKE: So grab a stick and throw it because I'm not doing it."
"LORELAI: No one asked you to."
"LUKE: Not yet."
"SOOKIE: I'm hungry. Let's get something."
"LORELAI: Whoa, check out the group. There might be loaves and fishes."
"SOOKIE: Hm. I had fish last night."
"KIRK: . . .Do not heed the naysayers. They will not lead you down the proper road."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory pulls up out front. Babette walks over to her]"
"BABETTE: Hey, Rory. Dig the sounds coming from that garage."
"RORY: They sound amazing."
"BABETTE: I was over there before. That new guitarist - yum yum, like a long-haired cake."
"RORY: Sounds like a winner."
"BABETTE: You gonna check him out?"
"RORY: Yeah, Lane called and asked me to come down and drink in the whole picture."
"BABETTE: Well, I got dibs on the new hunk. Rrrr!"
"[Rory walks to the garage and watches the band play]"
"GIL: Really tight, guys, but it's getting late. I gotta go."
"ZACH: Go rest."
"LANE: Hey, uh, Gil, this is my friend Rory. It's her house."
"RORY: Hey, you guys sound great."
"GIL: Don't you think? These guys are gonna be as good as Pink Floyd."
"ZACH: Nice topical reference."
"GIL: Well, Lane, you got my number?"
"LANE: Yeah, Gil, I've got your number."
"GIL: Great. So, we'll talk later?"
"LANE: We'll talk later."
"GIL: Take it easy."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Gil leaves]"
"LANE: Okay, Zach, shut up for a minute. I want to hear what Rory has to say. I didn't tell her what she was walking into, so she's our fresh eyes here."
"RORY: He's great."
"ZACH: And. . ."
"RORY: Experienced. And, um, Babette thinks he's really cute, so she's got dibs, and, um, he moves great. The jump was cool."
"ZACH: I was afraid he was gonna break a hip."
"LANE: Well, he's our only prospect."
"BRIAN: And maybe that schoolboy outfit's worth a sh*t."
"LANE: Yeah?"
"ZACH: Look, you're all fooling yourselves here. Bottom line - dude rocks, but dude's too old. I vote ""no."""
"LANE: Okay, I guess that's that, then."
"ZACH: That's that."
"LANE: And that could be that for the band."
"ZACH: That could be that, too."
"LANE: Okay."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[There's a knock at the door in the middle of the night. Lorelai walks down the steps]"
"LORELAI: Identify yourself!"
"SOOKIE: It's me!"
"LORELAI: Who?"
"SOOKIE: Me!"
"LORELAI: Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: It's not coming out!"
"LORELAI: My God, it's one in the morning."
"[Lorelai opens the door and Sookie walks in]"
"SOOKIE: It's lodged in there! It's stuck, for God's sake! It's not coming out!"
"LORELAI: You're insane."
"SOOKIE: And it's growing all the time, just getting bigger and bigger. I've forgotten what it's like not to be expanding. I'll get so huge, I'll be the fat guy in ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life."" I'll explode and slime the whole room. People could die."
"LORELAI: Honey, sit down, wrap this around you."
"SOOKIE: Ooh! That Andrew. I hate that he was right, that pasty-faced bastard!"
"LORELAI: Right about what?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, no, I can't sit."
"LORELAI: Right about what?"
"SOOKIE: I looked up an elephant's gestation period - 22 months!"
"LORELAI: You're not an elephant."
"SOOKIE: But Baby doesn't know that."
"LORELAI: Why would Baby think you're an elephant?"
"SOOKIE: Because he's tiny and stupid and floating around in a sack of fluid. He doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"SOOKIE: You know, an elephant squirted me once at the zoo. Maybe it sh*t something on me - some kind of elephant-gestation juice."
"LORELAI: Honey, I mean tonight. What happened? You were fine when I left you. Where did the freak-out come from?"
"SOOKIE: Are you listening? It's not coming out! The ship's too big and the bottle's too small!"
"LORELAI: You have to sit down and rest."
"SOOKIE: For two hours, I've been doing everything I can to make it come out. I mean, I've jumped, jiggled, shimmied."
"LORELAI: Add a feather boa and I could book you on the burlesque circuit."
"SOOKIE: My pain is funny to you."
"LORELAI: No, but you should not be hopscotching all around town trying to get the baby out. That's not how it works."
"SOOKIE: This is my mother's fault. She fed me too much roughage as a kid. Bran and granola and rapini. And now my insides are all rough and grabby, and Davey can't work his way out of my sandpaper innards. I want booze. I want a Manhattan and a scotch and a beer and a Rob Roy and a sidecar. But I can't, and I'm mad about that. I want to give birth!"
"LORELAI: I would give you a hug if you would sit still for one second."
"SOOKIE: Yours came out. How'd you get yours out?"
"LORELAI: I swallowed a map."
"SOOKIE: Cut the freaking vagueness. Why is it you mothers don't want to pass down your wisdom to other mothers? You're selfish."
"LORELAI: Please, stop jiggling."
"SOOKIE: Not 'til I'm skinny."
"LORELAI: All right, bouncy San Pedro, can I just show you something here?"
"SOOKIE: You can show me your sweet tokus as long as I can keep jiggling."
"LORELAI: Fine, keep jiggling. I was just going through something, I thought you might be interested. It's from 1984."
"SOOKIE: The book?"
"LORELAI: No, the year. It's my baby box. It's full of all these little things, mementos and stuff from the night Rory was born. I haven't taken it out in ages."
"SOOKIE: Mine's not getting a box because mine's not coming out."
"LORELAI: Mm. My walkman with the homemade compilation tape still in it. ""99 Luft Balloons,"" some R.E.M., some Thompson Twins."
"SOOKIE: I never cared for them."
"LORELAI: The magazine I was reading that night, with a special feature on who's hotter - Andrew McCarthy or Emilio Estevez."
"SOOKIE: They're both dogs."
"LORELAI: My Bubblicious-gum necklace, my Chunky wrapper."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, I do like the Chunky's. I'd like bourbon better, but I do like the Chunky's."
"LORELAI: John's digits."
"SOOKIE: John who?"
"LORELAI: He was volunteering at the hospital for high school credit. He said, ""Call me when you get your figure back."""
"SOOKIE: Sweet-talker. And for me, it was always Emilio 'cause he was kind of nasty."
"LORELAI: Same here. Rory's first jumper."
"SOOKIE: Bananarama?"
"LORELAI: I made it out of one of my t-shirts. It was the first thing I ever made her - ever made, ever. It was post-Gilmore economy. Look how tiny."
"SOOKIE: Tiny."
"LORELAI: She was the most beautiful pink all over. She even smelled pink. That sounds weird. I can't describe it - that little, pink, baby smell. The first time her eyes focused on me and her little fingers reached out. . .I was someone new. She had me."
"SOOKIE: Emilio."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"CUT TO BACKSTAGE AT THE FESTIVAL"
"MISS PATTY: We're five minutes away from the starting gate, people. Five minutes."
"RORY: Oh, my God, you guys look so cute. You know, it was just seven short years ago that I was a little Chinese acrobat just like you."
"KID: You smell!"
"RORY: And we respected our elders when I was a little Chinese acrobat."
"ANDREW: I hate kids."
"KIRK: Lookin' good, lookin' good."
"TROUBADOUR: Hey everybody, big night, huh? Hi, Kirk."
"KIRK: Hello."
"TROUBADOUR: Anyone sitting here?"
"KIRK: Yes. You have to go somewhere else."
"TROUBADOUR: But Miss Patty said I -"
"KIRK: You have to go somewhere else!"
"TROUBADOUR: Okay."
"KIRK: Perhaps there's an empty chair next to one of your friends, say, the high priest Caiaphas? Maybe he can accommodate you, hm?"
"TROUBADOUR: I guess so."
"LORELAI: Hey, Rory, one of those little acrobat boys told me my breath smells stinky. They're running wild."
"RORY: Acro-brats, I call them."
"LORELAI: Ha, nice!"
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Got your ferret."
"RORY: Oh, he looks mean."
"LORELAI: Aw, I don't think there's any such thing as a friendly ferret and definitely not a cute one."
"RORY: Yeah, they got dealt a rough card, those ferrets."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, art nouveau clock girl, hands off the face."
"TAYLOR: What? Art nouveau clock girl touched her face? This place is bedlam."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, relax, Taylor. We're right on schedule. Have a cigarette."
"TAYLOR: I don't smoke."
"MISS PATTY: Could you start?"
"LORELAI: Taylor, look, your cousin came to visit you backstage to say hello. [high-pitched voice] Oh, hello! What a pretty night it is for a festival! Do you have a mouse? I'm feeling a bit peckish."
"TAYLOR: Put that down."
"LORELAI: Just trying to lighten the mood."
"TAYLOR: It's too late. That Hank from Woodbury is sitting front-row center just trying to psych me out."
"LORELAI: Everybody's ready, Taylor, really."
"TAYLOR: I hope everybody is ready."
"LORELAI: [high pitched voice] Hey, let's all be friends. Can I nibble your neck?"
"MISS PATTY: He's really got his knickers in a twist tonight."
"RORY: Hey, talk more like a ferret."
"LORELAI: Sorry, time to attach it."
"MISS PATTY: So, is Sookie okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, she's great. Still big, still waiting, but she's fine."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, good."
"RORY: Was she the one shaking me in the middle of the night yelling, ""what motivated you to come out of your mother"" over and over?"
"LORELAI: She got a little spooked. There. Wow. You're beautiful, Anthea."
"RORY: I feel very painty."
"LORELAI: I gotta go change. Freeze good."
"RORY: I will."
"KIRK: The time approaches. I am ready."
"LORELAI: Aw. You might want to check that Gumby/Pokey watch, Kirk."
"KIRK: Right. Sorry. And it's a collectible, not a toy. It's an adult, uh. . .it's very valuable."
"CUT TO THE STAGE"
"[Taylor walks up to the podium]"
"TAYLOR: Ladies and gentlemen, I am Taylor Doose. Welcome to the 43rd annual Connecticut Festival of Living Pictures. [applause] As you may know, the town of Woodbury was supposed to host this year's festival, but due to their recent flooding, Woodbury backed out. They got a little moisture over there and basically said, ""Oh, well, whatever, never mind."" But the town of Stars Hollow was happy to step in because this vital tradition must continue. [applause] ""The Festival of Living Pictures"" has a storied history..."
"[cut to backstage]"
"ANDREW: Cecilia - that's a very pretty name. Very pretty."
"MISS PATTY: Keep it in your pants, Andrew. Okay, listen up, people. The fire department is out here because some dingbat parked in the red zone. Now, I warned you guys about parking there. So, who is it? Come on, speak up or you're gonna be towed. Who is it?"
"TROUBADOUR: I saw it when I came in, I think that's Kirk's."
"KIRK: You Judas!"
"MISS PATTY: Go move it, Kirk!"
"TROUBADOUR: Just trying to help."
"KIRK: Shouldn't you kiss me on the cheek before you betray me?"
"TROUBADOUR: You're gonna get towed."
"KIRK: Just keep away from me, pal!"
"TROUBADOUR: You know, I'm getting a little tired of this holier-than-thou attitude of yours."
"KIRK: I mean it."
"MISS PATTY: Rory, go, go, you're on. Hey, art nouveau clock girl, you got your Zippo on you?"
"[cut to the stage]"
"TAYLOR: Our first tableau was created by the talented craftsmen in our little town. It is a painting by the Italian master Girolamo Parmigianino. He was born in Parma and was of the mannerist school, becoming a master portraitist, blending the sensual style with the classical style of Raphael, as you can see in his ""Portrait of a Young Girl Named Anthea."" [applause]"
"[cut to backstage]"
"MISS PATTY: Five minutes to ""The Last Supper"", people, five minutes. Oh, my God! Christ, Judas, stop fighting! Shame you apostles, why couldn't you get in there and stop 'em?"
"KIRK: If I've re-pulled my calf muscle, you are so getting it!"
"TROUBADOUR: So perform a miracle and unpull it, you jerk!"
"KIRK: You're a blasphemer! You're a blasphemer and a traitor! And let's face it, you're unattractive."
"MISS PATTY: Okay, we got no time for this. Get your butts on that stage! And, apostles, keep Christ and Judas apart!"
"[cut to the stage]"
"TAYLOR: Da vinci's ""Last Supper"" has become one of the most revered masterpieces in the world. This majestic fresco was completed in 1498 and its prestige has never diminished."
"[cut to backstage]"
"TROUBADOUR: You've been a jerk from the start! What about Shakey's? You all went out without me, and you lied about it."
"KIRK: You're imagining things."
"TROUBADOUR: Well, Simon Peter said so. James, the son of Alpheus, Lebbeus - they all said so."
"KIRK: When did you speak with Lebbeus?"
"MISS PATTY: God help me, if you two don't shut up, I'm gonna stick these papier-mché rolls down your throats! That's it! That's it! Curtain!"
"[cut to the stage]"
"TAYLOR: And so now may we present ""The Last Supper."" [applause]"
"[Rory walks up to Lane in the audience]"
"RORY: So I was good? The ferret didn't upstage me?"
"LANE: The ferret underplayed it nicely."
"RORY: Hey, isn't that that guitarist?"
"LANE: It is. It's Gil. Rats, I was gonna call him tomorrow with the bad news."
"RORY: Well, you could just walk away rudely."
"LANE: I'll say a quick hello and tell him I'll call him tomorrow."
"[Lane walks over to Gil]"
"GIL: Hey, Lane. Trippy, huh?"
"LANE: Totally. How you doin', Gil?"
"GIL: Great. I saw the flyers, I thought I'd come check it out."
"LANE: Cool, great, yeah."
"GIL: Hey, don't sweat it, okay?"
"LANE: What do you mean?"
"GIL: It's okay. I know I'm not in the band."
"LANE: Oh."
"GIL: I picked up the vibe. The age difference - it doesn't bother me, but it's a little weird, I know."
"LANE: Maybe a little."
"GIL: It's cool, really."
"LANE: Good. Well, you're a great guy, Gil, and a great guitarist. Someone's gonna scoop you up quick."
"GIL: I hope so. I'm gonna keep going no matter what, not like last time."
"LANE: Last time?"
"GIL: Yeah. I had another band, a great band, the hottest band in L.A. We sold out all the clubs - The House of Blues, The Whiskey. A&R guys were hanging out. We had an awesome demo with tunes. Then we got our big break - an opening slot on a national tour with Quiet Riot."
"LANE: Wow!"
"GIL: But we blew it. We were fighting all the time over money, over chicks. We broke up before the tour even started."
"LANE: Oh no."
"GIL: It k*ll me. I didn't touch my Axe for years. I just got a day gig and lived my life. Then a few months ago, I picked up my guitar, and I realized how much I missed it. So I went out looking again, and that's how you got my tape."
"LANE: Wow."
"GIL: But I'm not stopping this time for anything. I'm gonna keep going until it happens. But thanks for letting me play with you guys. It was a blast. You're fantastic."
"LANE: Well, get used to playing with us, Gil, 'cause you're in the band."
"GIL: Really?"
"LANE: Really."
"GIL: No way!"
"LANE: Way."
"GIL: Oh, my God! This is so cool! I can't believe it."
"LANE: I'll call you tomorrow, okay?"
"GIL: Okay, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Honey, kids, I am in the band! Yes!"
"[Lane walks back over to Rory]"
"LANE: Our guitarist is married."
"RORY: You made his kids happy, too."
"CUT TO THE STAGE"
"TROUBADOUR: You guys watched the first two ""Matrix""s on DVD together, too. I heard all about it."
"KIRK: Get away from me."
"TAYLOR: ""The Last Supper,"" ladies and gentlemen. Serene, wasn't it?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is cleaning up when Nicole walks in]"
"LUKE: Better order quick. We're closing. . .soon."
"NICOLE: Surprise."
"LUKE: I'll say."
"NICOLE: Lots of nuttiness going on out there."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's the festival of nutty pictures, so. . ."
"NICOLE: You successfully avoid the nuttiness?"
"LUKE: Yeah, for the most part, yeah. Christ's table was broken, so I fixed it."
"NICOLE: He's a carpenter, he should have fixed it himself."
"LUKE: Yeah, well. . ."
"NICOLE: Speaking of nutty. . .all this, you and me."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"NICOLE: If it were happening to anyone else, I'd laugh."
"LUKE: About what?"
"NICOLE: Well, getting married is what broke us up. You gotta love the irony."
"LUKE: Yeah, it is a little ironic."
"NICOLE: Luke, I'm not gonna say that getting married on that ship like we did wasn't wrong. We should have thought more about it, but maybe rushing into divorce would be just as wrong."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"NICOLE: Well, we're still you and me. Why can't we have what we had before?"
"LUKE: Which was?"
"NICOLE: Two people who loved being together."
"LUKE: We're in the middle of a divorce."
"NICOLE: We can postpone it."
"LUKE: We can?"
"NICOLE: I'm a lawyer, I know these things."
"LUKE: Postpone it and do what?"
"NICOLE: Date."
"LUKE: Date?"
"NICOLE: Remember? That was the fun part."
"LUKE: So what you're saying is we get back together, not divorced, but not be married, either?"
"NICOLE: I guess. I know it sounds stupid, but it doesn't feel stupid, does it?"
"CUT TO THE FESTIVAL"
"TAYLOR: Picasso's ""Guernica,"" everybody. Wasn't that something? Our next work is found in the gardens of Versailles in the country of our former ally, France. It is one of more than two thousand sculptures to be found in that famed garden. I'd like to turn your attention now to our town's beloved gazebo for ""The Reaper."""
"[cut to backstage]"
"MISS PATTY: Okay, our statue's done. Stamp it, ship it. Terrence and Lorelai, our Renoir couple, you're up next. Be ready."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm just about done here, Patty. Just give me one second."
"MISS PATTY: Okay, I'm just saying, two-minute warning. Terrence, get into place. My aching feet will never forgive me."
"RORY: You ready for your close-up, Miss Desmond?"
"LORELAI: Just about."
"RORY: Grand finale. It's a great way to close this thing."
"LORELAI: You know, I don't know why everybody's rushing me like this."
"RORY: Mom. . .you okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. No."
"RORY: No?"
"LORELAI: My heart is going a million miles a second. I feel hot. Is my makeup running?"
"RORY: No, Mom, you look great. What's wrong?"
"LORELAI: I flinched."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Seven years ago on this very stage in this very costume, I flinched."
"RORY: No, you didn't."
"LORELAI: Yes, I did. You weren't watching. I was in denial. I just didn't want Taylor to be right, but he was. I flinched."
"RORY: Well, so what? You flinched a little. I bet most people didn't see it."
"LORELAI: Stevie Wonder could have seen it. I almost knocked Terrence down. I flinched. I am a big, fat flincher!"
"RORY: But that was a long time ago."
"LORELAI: Once a flincher, always a flincher."
"RORY: No, no, Mom. That was seven years ago. You're different now."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I am. I'm less stable. My muscles are weaker and my bones are more fragile. There are a dozen more ways for me to wobble now. I'm a Weeble, and Weebles wobble. I'm gonna blow the whole finale and the town is gonna hate me."
"RORY: Mom, listen, you are in amazing physical shape. This is mental. You can b*at it."
"LORELAI: How?"
"RORY: 'Cause you can."
"LORELAI: No specifics?"
"RORY: Not really."
"LORELAI: Well, I need something."
"RORY: Close your eyes and think of England."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: And know that I love you no matter what happens up there and go be still."
"LORELAI: England, England."
"RORY: England."
"MISS PATTY: She's not gonna flinch, is she? Is she?"
"[cut to the stage]"
"TAYLOR: . . . made Pierre Auguste Renoir one of the world's most beloved painters. So to close our triumphant evening, we give you his incomparable ""Dance at Bougival."" [applause]"
"RORY: Good girl. Keep it up."
"[Sookie's baby pager goes off]"
"RORY: Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no."
"MISS PATTY: What the hell is that?"
"RORY: It's Sookie's baby pager."
"MISS PATTY: Oy to the vey!"
"[""The Entertainer"" continues playing from the pager]"
"MISS PATTY: I can't look."
"RORY: Keep frozen. Keep frozen."
"MISS PATTY: What's happening? That's it. Curtain!"
"TAYLOR: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for making tonight such a success. On behalf of the town of Stars Hollow, we bid you adieu from ""The Festival of Living Pictures."" [applause]"

"[Lorelai, Rory, Richard, and Emily are eating dinner]"
"RORY: More broccoli, Grandpa?"
"RICHARD: Absolutely. Staves off the cancer."
"LORELAI: Staves off my appetite."
"EMILY: You really should eat more green things, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I plan to eat a five-dollar bill later tonight."
"RORY: Oh, have you seen the new twenties? They have a little peach color in 'em."
"LORELAI: Peach, perfect. I'll eat a new twenty, I'll have my fruits and vegetables."
"RICHARD: I think we saw some of the new twenties in Atlantic City, didn't we, Emily?"
"EMILY: I think."
"RORY: How was Atlantic City? Successful?"
"RICHARD: Very."
"LORELAI: Well, Siskel's chimed in. What about you?"
"EMILY: I'm refraining."
"RICHARD: It's a bit of a sore subject."
"LORELAI: We'll talk about something else."
"EMILY: The garishness, the garishness."
"LORELAI: Thus spake Ebert."
"EMILY: Why have a simple sign if it can be in bright flashing neon? And the new slot machines? They don't just make obnoxious bell sounds anymore, they yell at you."
"LORELAI: The slot machines were talking to you, Mom? Are you sure it wasn't just you?"
"RICHARD: Oh, they talk, I can verify that. One of them kept yelling, ""wheel. . .of. . .fortune!"""
"EMILY: And the parking lot of the hotel that we stayed at had an area for RV's."
"LORELAI: Perish the thought!"
"EMILY: And the boardwalk..."
"RORY: Oh, I've always wanted to see the Atlantic City boardwalk."
"EMILY: I'll save you a trip. Tip an overflowing trash can on your front porch and walk up and down on it."
"RICHARD: It was actually quite a successful outing. Maybe not to our taste, but the clients loved it."
"EMILY: The clients were too plastered to know better."
"LORELAI: Kind of the point."
"EMILY: Two of them stayed up all night and smelled like it."
"RICHARD: That was a tad gross."
"EMILY: One of them - a married man - had a long conversation with. . .how shall I put this delicately? A woman of less than reputable nature."
"LORELAI: Hm. Do hookers charge to let you talk to them?"
"RORY: Depends on what they're doing when they're talking to you."
"EMILY: Rory!"
"RORY: Sorry."
"EMILY: I expect that from your mother, but not you."
"RORY: Just a joke."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Mom, Yale is broadening her world view."
"EMILY: Digger was in his element."
"RICHARD: You mean Jason was in his element."
"EMILY: He caroused along with the best of them."
"LORELAI: You carouse any, Dad?"
"RICHARD: I played a little craps, but the tables were ice-cold."
"EMILY: What's the next outing Jason has planned for your clients, Richard? Spring break in Cancún so you can do shots off people's bellies?"
"LORELAI: I'm uncomfortable hearing you say that."
"RORY: Me, too."
"RICHARD: I can assure you, Emily, that there are no belly shots in our future."
"LORELAI: Although doing one off Dad's belly is okay. You're married."
"EMILY: And those gifts. Those heinous gifts he gave out."
"RICHARD: Oh, we had little roulette wheels printed up with our company name on them. They were a big hit. Perfect for an executive's table. I got one for each of you."
"EMILY: Richard, don't, it's embarrassing."
"RORY: They're cute."
"EMILY: They're the antithesis of class - so like Digger."
"RICHARD: Emily, that was his nickname as a boy, and he's sensitive about it."
"EMILY: I've never called him that to his face."
"RICHARD: You did at that craps table, and then he sevened out."
"EMILY: Please, let's discuss something other than New Jersey."
"RICHARD: I am more than willing."
"LORELAI: Hey, have you guys read any of Rory's articles in the Yale newspaper?"
"EMILY: Of course, we've read them all."
"RICHARD: Fine work, Rory. The Yale Daily News is lucky to have you."
"RORY: Oh, it's really not a big deal."
"LORELAI: Hey, they're right. Take your props."
"RICHARD: You'll be running that paper before long."
"RORY: I'm not even on staff yet."
"EMILY: You're not?"
"RORY: These are just tryout articles to qualify. You have to write something for every department, and then if those pass muster, then you're on staff."
"RICHARD: Well, your coverage of that lacrosse match was very exciting."
"LORELAI: Yeah. For two seconds, I almost gave a flying you-know-what about lacrosse."
"EMILY: I liked your coverage on the new funds approved for upkeep on the divinity quadrangle."
"RICHARD: You made it sing."
"EMILY: We're having all your articles laminated."
"RORY: That's very nice."
"LORELAI: Yes! I got my number."
"CUT TO THE YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE"
"[Rory is looking through a newspaper]"
"PARIS: It just seems like a quaint archaism. I mean, if you're a good journalist, why make you jump through hoops and write all these tryout articles? Stale bagel."
"RORY: It's a time-honored tradition. All our forebears had to do it."
"PARIS: If our forebears had fought it, we wouldn't be dealing with it now. What are you looking for?"
"RORY: My article. I did a review of the chamber-music recital."
"PARIS: Must be in there somewhere. And that's the other thing - they print everything."
"RORY: Hm, that's weird."
"PARIS: They'd print my mattress tag if it was in the right margins."
"RORY: It's not here."
"PARIS: Impossible."
"RORY: No, I've looked pretty thoroughly."
"PARIS: Must be a mistake."
"RORY: No, it's really not here."
"PARIS: Just means parakeets will be crapping on something else in the morning. They're all stale."
"DOYLE: Morning. Morning."
"RORY: Hi, Doyle."
"DOYLE: Hi, Rory. Coffee mint?"
"RORY: No, thanks."
"DOYLE: I'm addicted to these things. So is Bob Woodward. So I hear - not that I'm copying him. What's up?"
"RORY: Well, I was wondering if there was a problem with my review."
"DOYLE: Oh, the review? Which was yours, the quartet?"
"RORY: Yeah, chamber music at Sprague Hall."
"DOYLE: Right, right."
"RORY: Did I get it in late?"
"DOYLE: No, you got it in right on time. You're good about that."
"RORY: But you didn't print it."
"DOYLE: No, we didn't."
"RORY: So, space issue?"
"DOYLE: No, we had the space. We always have the space, but it was a bit of a yawn."
"RORY: A yawn?"
"DOYLE: Yeah."
"RORY: Well, you know, chamber-music recitals are very low-key, kind of yawny affairs. Pretty music but no stage diving or anything."
"DOYLE: I meant the writing."
"RORY: The writing was kind of a yawn?"
"DOYLE: But don't sweat it. You'll do better next time."
"RORY: Right, sure."
"DOYLE: My mother liked it."
"RORY: Liked what?"
"DOYLE: The recital. She's old. Excuse me."
"RORY: Sure. Sure."
"PARIS: Your article didn't get in?"
"RORY: No, it didn't."
"PARIS: [checks the paper] Mine did. Good, good. I'm going to get a bagel."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Lane are walking down the street]"
"LORELAI: He actually used the word yawn?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: What a jerk."
"LANE: You should punch him where it counts."
"RORY: He was just doing his job."
"LORELAI: He could have been a little more diplomatic."
"LANE: The word yawn is insulting."
"RORY: Yeah, but I was actually tired when I wrote it, so it probably wasn't my best work. I should write my articles at night first, then study."
"LORELAI: I still say Yawn Guy needs a little learnin'."
"LANE: Yeah, kick him where the sun don't shine."
"LORELAI: You really are not good at threats."
"LANE: I know, and I hate that."
"RORY: I'll just chalk it up to experience."
"LANE: Hey, what time do you have?"
"RORY: Uh, five to four."
"LANE: Five minutes to my call with Dave. I should get home."
"LORELAI: Hey, are we still mad at him?"
"LANE: We never were."
"LORELAI: That's right. Must be Jackson. We're mad at Jackson for something he said to Sookie."
"RORY: No, we're not."
"LORELAI: You sure?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Must be Gypsy. We're mad at her husband?"
"RORY: She's not married."
"LORELAI: This is gonna bug me."
"RORY: So, how is Dave?"
"LANE: He's great. I just wish he weren't three thousand miles away."
"RORY: How did he take the news that you found a replacement for him in the band?"
"LANE: He was a little weird about it."
"LORELAI: And that's why we're mad at him."
"RORY: We're not mad at Dave."
"LORELAI: Must be Jackson."
"LANE: I miss that boy."
"RORY: Well, he'll be home for Christmas, right?"
"LANE: He better."
"LORELAI: This is my stop."
"RORY: Say hi to the baby for me."
"LORELAI: Find out who we're mad at."
"RORY: We're not mad at anybody."
"LORELAI: We're always mad at somebody."
"[Lorelai walks up to Sookie's house. Michel is sitting on the front porch]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Door's open. Aren't they home?"
"MICHEL: They are home. I'm not welcome in it."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Lorelai, come on in."
"MICHEL: I'm being discriminated against. Go, enjoy."
"LORELAI: Michel can't come in?"
"SOOKIE: Nope."
"MICHEL: I'm Rosa Parks."
"LORELAI: Why can't Rosa Parks come in?"
"SOOKIE: He sneezed."
"MICHEL: Five days ago."
"SOOKIE: I can't take a chance with the baby."
"MICHEL: It's a business meeting. The baby should not attend."
"SOOKIE: He's a week old. What should he do, take in a movie?"
"MICHEL: I got dust up my nose. It made me sneeze. I am not sick."
"SOOKIE: [to Lorelai] Come on in."
"LORELAI: Sorry. Uh-huh-huh-huh. . .oh, no. Whew!"
"MICHEL: Not funny."
"[Lorelai walks into the house]"
"LORELAI: There he is. Oh. Oh, widdle Davey, widdle Davey, peekaboo, peekaboo. Oh, you have a widdle nose. Oh, oh, no, Aunt Lorelai's got your nose. Do you want it back? Do you? Do you?"
"SOOKIE: He's not indicating that he wants it back."
"LORELAI: Well, then, I'm going to keep it."
"MICHEL: This is painful."
"SOOKIE: You know, he said his first word this morning."
"LORELAI: Who? Michel? What'd he say?"
"SOOKIE: He said, ""ah-oopah."""
"LORELAI: Did you say, ""ah-oopah""? Did you? Well, you're very talented. Did you know that?"
"MICHEL: If I throw up, do you want it on the bushes or the grass?"
"LORELAI: Michel, don't you like babies?"
"MICHEL: I don't know. I've never been near one. I thought today was my chance."
"LORELAI: I brought pastries."
"SOOKIE: Excellent."
"LORELAI: Do you want one, Michel?"
"MICHEL: So I can look even sadder, sitting and eating pastry by myself? No, thank you. Can we start?"
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, I'm here to report that the Dragonfly is officially demoed and stripped to its studs, to the point where it looks worse than ever and you can't imagine it ever looking good ever again."
"SOOKIE: Excellent."
"MICHEL: There are big, flying things out here."
"LORELAI: But we're on schedule, and when I left, the plumbing contractor was unloading all sorts of impressive-looking copper pipes, so that's something, I guess, and. . .oh, Bruce."
"BRUCE: Hello."
"LORELAI: I thought you'd gone."
"BRUCE: I came back."
"LORELAI: Well, there you go."
"SOOKIE: Bruce is not only a midwife, she's also a lactation specialist."
"LORELAI: Yikes."
"MICHEL: Ugh."
"BRUCE: Is that the sneezer?"
"MICHEL: It was dust. What are these big green things with wings?"
"LORELAI: You know, Bruce, I didn't get a chance to tell you how impressed I was by the home birth. It was just amazing to watch and very, very special."
"BRUCE: Did you talk baby talk to Davey?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"BRUCE: Every second Davey's brain is hard-wiring for life. Baby talk can retard his language-acquisition rate. Is that what you want?"
"LORELAI: Definitely not. I want him fully tarded."
"MICHEL: This flying green thing is toying with me."
"BRUCE: In five minutes, we'll feed."
"SOOKIE: Five minutes. Did I tell you she donates her services to indigent, inner-city mothers?"
"LORELAI: It's okay."
"MICHEL: All right, this thing is getting ready to b*mb."
"LORELAI: So, Davey, beautiful day, huh? What would you like to discuss? Middle East peace, the space program? I'm sorry, what's that? Oh, my God. He said, ""the answer to the problems in the mideast is, 'I have to poop.'"""
"SOOKIE: He got distracted."
"LORELAI: And now there's no peace? Davey, come on, man, hard-wire those adult thoughts and try to remember what we're talking. . . and he said that Thursday's impossible to start work and I reminded him about our contract."
"SOOKIE: Good, because he needed to be reminded."
"LORELAI: So that's all taken care of."
"MICHEL: I'm being attacked by green things!"
"BRUCE: It's time to feed."
"LORELAI: Well, this has been a very productive meeting."
"SOOKIE: Very."
"CUT TO YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE"
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hi, Doyle. Got something for you."
"DOYLE: Your new review?"
"RORY: My new review."
"DOYLE: Remember ""The New Zoo Revue""?"
"RORY: Henrietta hippo?"
"DOYLE: Freddie the frog, and who was the third one? What was the third one?"
"RORY: I'm drawing a blank."
"DOYLE: Oh, I hate that. Whenever there's three of something, you always forget the third one. It's like a statistical thing."
"RORY: Do you want me to come back?"
"DOYLE: No, let's look at it now."
"RORY: So I drank a lot of coffee before writing this, so hopefully it won't be a yawn."
"DOYLE: Good. [reads Rory's article and crosses things out]"
"RORY: Doyle."
"DOYLE: Just a sec."
"RORY: You're crossing everything out."
"DOYLE: Not everything."
"RORY: Well, the only thing you haven't crossed out is what you haven't read yet."
"DOYLE: Hold on, hold on, okay? Well, it's better than your last one. You're showing progress."
"RORY: Oh."
"DOYLE: Really."

"DOYLE: Hazing?"
"RORY: I put a lot of time into this."
"DOYLE: Oh, I know. It's definitely not for lack of trying."
"RORY: Is it something personal? Did I do something to offend you?"
"DOYLE: No, Rory, this is how it works. It's not personal. It's just not very good."
"RORY: I rewrote it four times, and I researched it so thoroughly."
"DOYLE: Don't worry about the facts. You seem to have gotten those right. Stan, file this for me."
"RORY: So, it's not good?"
"DOYLE: I just couldn't tell what you really thought."
"RORY: But I tried so hard."
"DOYLE: Oh, I know."
"RORY: So I should try less hard?"
"DOYLE: Look, just write what you think. You have opinions, don't you?"
"RORY: Sure, I do."
"DOYLE: That's what will work."
"RORY: Sounds simple."
"DOYLE: It can be. Charlie the owl. That's the third one."
"RORY: Right, right, Charlie. Guess I'll go."
"DOYLE: Don't worry. Either you'll get the hang of things or you won't."
"RORY: Uh huh."
"DOYLE: Just make sure this one's good."
"RORY: Got it."
"CUT TO YALE THEATER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Wow, pretty. Yale's got the big bucks, huh?"
"RORY: Yeah, I guess."
"LORELAI: This is gonna be fun."
"RORY: It's work for me."
"LORELAI: Are those our seats, all saved and everything?"
"RORY: One of the advantages of being with the press."
"LORELAI: Are you okay?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm the happiest unpublished writer in the newspaper biz."
"LORELAI: You are not unpublished."
"RORY: I am recently unpublished."
"LORELAI: Don't forget your lacrosse-story triumph."
"RORY: Yeah, maybe lacrosse is the only thing I'm good at writing about, and I'd never heard of it before I was assigned it."
"LORELAI: Now, come on."
"RORY: Hopefully, there will be plenty of well-paid, full-time lacrosse-writing positions for me at the major news organizations."
"LORELAI: You need chocolate."
"RORY: Chocolate and talent."
"LORELAI: Stop that."
"RORY: Maybe I'm just not cut out for college journalism. Maybe I peaked in high school. Aw, man, that's a depressing thought."
"LORELAI: You didn't peak. This is just a different environment and a bigger league, and that's half the fun, isn't it?"
"RORY: Kind of. Here we go."
"LORELAI: Ah, I love these seats. They're so important."
"[The ballet starts]"
"RORY: Oh."
"LORELAI: Well, she recovered quickly."
"RORY: Whoa."
"LORELAI: The floor must be slippery."
"RORY: Huh."
"LORELAI: I don't think the guy is supposed to wince when he lifts the ballerina."
"RORY: Maybe it was involuntary?"
"LORELAI: She wasn't supposed to kick him like that, was she?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"LORELAI: It gives new meaning to the word nutcracker."
"[they giggle]"
"LORELAI: Shh, shh."
"[cut to the theater after the ballet is over]"
"LORELAI: Wow."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: That was terrible."
"RORY: From the opening kerplunk."
"LORELAI: And just kept getting worse."
"RORY: I'm in physical discomfort."
"LORELAI: That lead ballerina - she has no friends."
"RORY: How can you tell?"
"LORELAI: Because no one gave her the heads-up on the roll of fat around the bra strap."
"RORY: Maybe she just has no friends in the ballet."
"LORELAI: All ballet people do is ballet. If she has no friends in the ballet, she has no friends. Holy moly."
"RORY: I wonder how many times I can use the word ""blows"" in an article before it becomes redundant."
"LORELAI: What are you gonna write?"
"RORY: I don't know. What I think, I guess."
"LORELAI: Really."
"RORY: Well, apparently, that's what was missing from my other pieces - my opinions, so. . ."
"LORELAI: Well, if you want my opinion, that end curtain came down way too slowly."
"RORY: I'll try to work that in."
"LORELAI: Man oh man. If Vincent Gallo could just see this, he'd feel a whole lot better about ""Brown Bunny."""
"CUT TO YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE"
"[Doyle reads over Rory's article]"
"DOYLE: Nice."
"RORY: Nice?"
"DOYLE: Really great job."
"RORY: Really?"
"DOYLE: Really."
"RORY: Oh, wow, thanks."
"DOYLE: Thank you. Stan, get this to layout."
"STAN: Yeah."
"DOYLE: I love doing that."
"RORY: And you look good doing it."
"DOYLE: Coffee mint?"
"RORY: Thanks."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs. Kim walks a customer to the door]"
"CUSTOMER: This piece is beautiful. My wife's gonna flip."
"MRS. KIM: Good. Now, it's very fragile, so keep it away from young children."
"CUSTOMER: We don't have children."
"MRS. KIM: You should. Everyone should have children."
"CUSTOMER: Okay. Thank you."
"MRS. KIM: You're welcome. Lane?"
"LANE: Yes, Mama?"
"MRS. KIM: I have something for Dave."
"LANE: For Dave, my Dave?"
"MRS. KIM: Something for you to send to him in California. Special gift from me to him."
"LANE: Really?"
"MRS. KIM: Could you wrap it and take it to the post office?"
"LANE: Definitely. That's so sweet, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: He's a good boy. He's going to make a good man."
"LANE: I agree."
"MRS. KIM: I'm going to make some tea."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Michel are walking down the street]"
"MICHEL: So, I looked up what Bruce said about baby talk and she was right. You should never talk baby talk to a baby."
"LORELAI: That's sad."
"MICHEL: Yeah. So I've been calling all my friends and relatives with babies to tell them to immediately stop talking to them."
"LORELAI: You mean, stop talking baby talk?"
"MICHEL: No, it's better that they just stop altogether."
"LORELAI: Ittle-bitty Michel."
"MICHEL: Now, stop that."
"LORELAI: Well, I like talking baby talk and I can't do it to babies, so I need an outlet. And you're my outwet - wittle Michel with the happy hair."
"MICHEL: Goodbye."
"LORELAI: You no wanna eat? Aw, look at him walking. Big boy walkie. Ooh."
"[Lorelai walks into Luke's Diner and sees Nicole sitting at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Nicole!"
"NICOLE: Hi, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll be. Look at you there."
"NICOLE: It's nice to see you."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Does Luke know you're here?"
"NICOLE: Yeah, he's just in the back. Do you want him?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't want him, I don't want him. I was just coming in for a bite with a friend and. . .not my imaginary friend. My friend Michel was with me, but he doesn't eat normal food like this, so he's not coming in, so. . . you good?"
"NICOLE: Very good. And you?"
"LORELAI: Very good, too. I'm just still living here in Stars Hollow, and, um, Rory's going to Yale."
"NICOLE: I knew that."
"LORELAI: Of course. Well, naturally, you would be all filled in 'cause Luke's talking to you regularly, and. . ."
"NICOLE: Mmhmm."
"LORELAI: So, um. . .I met a bunch of lawyers from your firm."
"NICOLE: Really?"
"LORELAI: I did, yes, because, well, I'm - they were coming in to see Luke, and I'm in here a lot, so. . ."
"NICOLE: Right. Yeah, they're good guys."
"LORELAI: Really good guys. They like you a lot."
"NICOLE: They're the partners at my firm."
"LORELAI: Well, so they have to like you. So, is Luke coming out, or. . ."
"NICOLE: He should be."
"LORELAI: You know, I'm not hungry."
"NICOLE: No?"
"LORELAI: I just remembered, I just ate."
"NICOLE: Oh."
"LORELAI: So. . .but it's really good to see you."
"NICOLE: Same here."
"LORELAI: Really good."
"NICOLE: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: Okay. So. . . [leaves]"
"CUT TO YALE"
"[Rory is walking toward her dorm]"
"RORY: [answers cell phone] Hello?"
"LANE: Oh, thank God."
"RORY: Lane?"
"LANE: I just had the biggest fight with Dave that we've ever had ever, and it's all my mother's fault."
"RORY: Your mother? Why?"
"LANE: Get this - earlier today, my mom asked me to wrap something that she wants to send to Dave."
"RORY: Is it his birthday?"
"LANE: No, this was something else altogether. You holding onto your hat?"
"RORY: I'm not wearing one, but I can pretend to be."
"LANE: It's the jug."
"RORY: What jug?"
"LANE: The jug. The big jug. The monumental jug."
"RORY: What jug?"
"LANE: Remember when I was a kid, my mother showed me the special jug that's been passed down in my family for years and years in a long-standing Kim tradition that she is personally going to present to the boy I'm going to wed?"
"RORY: Oh, my God. The marriage jug?"
"LANE: The marriage jug."
"RORY: She's sending Dave the marriage jug? What does that mean?"
"LANE: I'm guessing it means she's reserving a hall and ordering that ""Stations of the Cross"" ice sculpture."
"RORY: Whoa, this is serious."
"LANE: No kidding."
"RORY: I had forgotten all about it."
"LANE: I didn't. It's been sitting on that shelf all my life, and I kind of liked that it was there. It was a nice thing, a nice tradition. I had pleasant associations with it, and now I want to break it into a million pieces."
"RORY: What inspired her?"
"LANE: Who knows?"
"RORY: Have you been sending out a vibe or something?"
"LANE: A vibe, no. What kind of vibe?"
"RORY: Like a marriage vibe."
"LANE: I don't know what that is. I mean, maybe. I love Dave. If you love a boy, do you automatically send out a marriage vibe?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"LANE: I feel weird just saying that."
"RORY: Well, wait, why did you and Dave get into a big fight?"
"LANE: Well, I didn't send him the jug, but I had to give him a heads-up in case he called here innocently and my mom said something to him like, ""You rent that tux yet?"" So I did, and he was really mean about it. He was very against getting the jug."
"RORY: You thought he'd be all for it?"
"LANE: No, but he was way too down on the idea."
"RORY: Lane, he's eighteen. He just started college."
"LANE: I know."
"RORY: Jug or no jug, he's not ready to get married."
"LANE: I know."
"RORY: And neither are you."
"LANE: I know. Someday maybe."
"RORY: Yes, someday, but not now."
"LANE: Great. Now we're about to get into a fight?"
"RORY: No, we're not. There have just been enough young people marrying in my life. I don't want any more."
"LANE: Okay."
"RORY: What are you gonna do?"
"LANE: I don't know. She's going to expect a call or note from him, thanking his soon-to-be mother-in-law or else she'll be offended."
"RORY: Probably."
"LANE: I guess I've got to talk to her about it."
"RORY: I don't see any other way."
"[Rory arrives at her suite door, which says ""Die Jerk"" on it]"
"RORY: Whoa."
"LANE: What?"
"RORY: Someone wrote something on our door - ""Die Jerk."""
"LANE: It says ""Die Jerk""?"
"RORY: It's not coming off."
"LANE: Wow. Cool things like that never happen at adventist school."
"[Paris opens the suite door]"
"PARIS: Rory."
"RORY: Someone wrote ""Die Jerk"" on our door."
"PARIS: I know. I thought maybe the person who did it was back to make good on the promise."
"RORY: Who did this?"
"PARIS: I don't know, but we've got to find out and strike back hard. Come on, we're assembling inside."
"RORY: Lane, I gotta go. We're assembling. Sorry about the jug."
"LANE: It's okay. Keep me posted."
"RORY: Yeah, you, too. Bye."
"PARIS: [to student walking by] What's your business here?"
"[Rory and Paris walk into the common room]"
"RORY: Fun stuff, huh, guys?"
"JANET: Yeah, it's ridiculous."
"TANNA: I may have been here when it happened."
"JANET: And you heard nothing?"
"TANNA: No."
"PARIS: Way to have that radar up."
"RORY: Let's not make each other feel bad."
"PARIS: Hey, hug a dolphin another day, all right? We need to rev up the g*n and retaliate before the next strike. We gotta go full-out Sharon."
"RORY: Whoa, whoa, whoa."
"TANNA: There's gonna be another strike?"
"PARIS: You wanna wait to find out? Now, first, we should each make a list of the people we've made enemies of, starting with most recent and working our way back."
"TANNA: Can't we just let this go?"
"JANET: It may just be a joke."
"PARIS: I'm not laughing. Anyone here laughing?"
"TANNA: I guess it is vandalism."
"PARIS: It's more than that. This is an as*ault that should be met head-on using extreme prejudice. Now let's face it, I'm the most likely target, so I've already made up a list of enemies, which I've narrowed down from twenty-six to five."
"JANET: Just at Yale?"
"PARIS: Just in this building."
"TANNA: Maybe we should move."
"PARIS: Retreat? I think not."
"JANET: There's a girl on my volleyball team who's livid at me. I kissed her boyfriend."
"TANNA: I'm exceedingly dull."
"PARIS: Keep her close."
"TANNA: What about you?"
"RORY: Me?"
"JANET: Made anyone mad lately?"
"PARIS: Oh, please, that would be like Dorothy pissing off the Tin Man. It's impossible."
"TANNA: I'm not leaving my room."
"JANET: I'll keep you posted on my person."
"PARIS: And my five are already taken care of."
"TANNA: They're taken care of?"
"PARIS: I got my East Side 860 partners on it. Now let's move."
"RORY: Wanna watch tv?"
"TANNA: Something light."
"RORY: I'm with you."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hi, Luke."
"LUKE: Hi. Take a seat anywhere."
"LORELAI: Very hungry."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, you're in the right place."
"LORELAI: Twice."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: I've come here twice. This is my second trip today."
"LUKE: Oh, right, yeah. Well, you didn't eat."
"LORELAI: Oh, you knew I was here?"
"LUKE: Uh, why didn't you stay?"
"LORELAI: I wasn't that hungry."
"LUKE: Oh."
"LORELAI: So, what's new?"
"LUKE: Uh, got some new coffee pots."
"LORELAI: Anything else?"
"LUKE: New filters."
"LORELAI: Anything else?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Anything else?"
"LUKE: Other than ""no"", no."
"LORELAI: Nicole, Luke. Nicole was here. She's the one who told you that I was here and didn't stay. She's new. Nothing new."
"LUKE: Well, you saw her, so it's not new."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's so new. What's going on there?"
"LUKE: Well, we're kind of seeing each other again."
"LORELAI: Thank you, and. . .boy!"
"LUKE: It's not heavy-duty."
"LORELAI: So you're not getting divorced?"
"LUKE: Yeah, we put it on hold."
"LORELAI: Put the divorce on hold?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Can you do that?"
"LUKE: I don't know. It's all new to me."
"LORELAI: So, um, is she moving in with you?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: What, no? You're husband and wife. It's not a crazy question."
"LUKE: No, we're man and woman. We're just seeing each other as if we're not husband and wife."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, the state of Connecticut sees it differently, you know. To the state, you're sharing a toothbrush holder and deciding together whether there's enough in the dishwasher to justify running it."
"LUKE: Hopefully, the state will stay out of my way."
"LORELAI: Now, what about taxes?"
"LUKE: What about them?"
"LORELAI: Well, you file single, jointly? I mean, what do you do?"
"LUKE: That's not for months."
"LORELAI: You can't put it off."
"LUKE: I'm not doing my taxes right now."
"LORELAI: Capone?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: They got him for tax evasion."
"LUKE: I don't plan on evading my taxes. Look, why are you pressing this?"
"LORELAI: Because it's weird."
"LUKE: You think it's weird?"
"LORELAI: Yes. I am a cross section of the community, and if I think it's weird, then Rory thinks it's weird, and if Rory thinks that, then Miss Patty thinks that, and so on and so on."
"LUKE: We're just not dealing with it right now. We're just letting things happen as they happen. We're going with the flow."
"LORELAI: You're going with the flow?"
"LUKE: We're going with the flow."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's so strum your sitar, dig the Maharishi, pass the owsley, summer of love, flower power, hippie-dippie, I can't stand it."
"LUKE: You don't have to."
"LORELAI: I hope you're not expecting a wedding present, 'cause I'm just putting it on hold 'til this whole thing clears up."
"LUKE: Fine."
"LORELAI: It's a good present."
"LUKE: You haven't gotten it yet."
"LORELAI: It would have been a good present."
"LUKE: Look, what is it? You don't like Nicole?"
"LORELAI: I like Nicole. She's very nice. I don't think she likes me."
"LUKE: She likes you fine, and, yes, she is very nice, and I missed her and she missed me and so we're dating again, putting off the hassle of getting a stupid divorce. Avoiding that hassle is the nice fringe benefit of getting back together again."
"LORELAI: Aha, the hassle. Now we're getting down to it. If the divorce wasn't a hassle, would you still have gotten back together with her?"
"LUKE: I don't want to talk about this anymore."
"LORELAI: Is that why we're still friends - because it would be too big a hassle for you to tell me you don't want to be friends anymore?"
"LUKE: What do you want to eat?"
"LORELAI: Eating's a hassle. I'll just starve."
"LUKE: Fine."
"LORELAI: And I'll starve right here because it would be too big a hassle to get up and leave."
"LUKE: I'll work around you."
"LORELAI: And hey, if it's too big a hassle to get rid of my body after I die of starvation, just leave it here to decompose all nice and quiet - no hassle."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: See ya."
"LUKE: Wow, she's moving."
"LORELAI: Well, I was kind of kidding about the decomposing here."
"LUKE: But you still haven't eaten."
"LORELAI: I'm not hungry, again."
"LUKE: Fine, see ya."
"LORELAI: And I liked the old coffee pots. The new ones look stupid. [leaves]"

"RORY: I don't think so."
"SANDRA: That's very flattering."
"RORY: Can I help you?"
"SANDRA: Let's see if this jogs your memory. I have the grace of a drunken dock worker?"
"RORY: Oh."
"SANDRA: Remember me now?"
"RORY: The ballerina from the ballet."
"SANDRA: That's right."
"RORY: Your outfits are made of tulle, aren't they?"
"SANDRA: You're a jerk!"
"RORY: I know. You wrote that on my door."
"SANDRA: You're lucky that's all I did!"
"RORY: Should we go somewhere else?"
"SANDRA: Your review was mean and petty and despicable!"
"RORY: Look, Sandra - that's your name, right? Sandra? This was all in the line of duty. It was an assignment from my editor, so it was nothing personal, okay?"
"SANDRA: You called me a hippo!"
"RORY: No, I compared you to a hippo, that's not calling you a hippo. And it was a humorous comparison. I was trying to -"
"SANDRA: To destroy me and my company!"
"RORY: No, and think about it - I bet that more than likely, very few people will even read the review, and most people aren't even interested in ballet in the first place. It's unfortunate and awful and I hate it, but what can you do? It's Avril Lavigne's world, and we're just living in it. Plus, most people left before the end, and I stuck it out. That's something."
"SANDRA: I'm curious. How much ballet experience do you have? You must have a lot since you write about it with such authority."
"RORY: Well, none to speak of. I had a few years of beginners' class and I stunk."
"SANDRA: Anybody write about it in the paper?"
"RORY: No. Good point."
"SANDRA: I've been dancing three hours a day, seven days a week for fourteen years. I've done two summer sessions with the Miami ballet, and I'm on the waiting list at Juilliard, and now your review is out there for everyone to see!"
"RORY: Look, I -"

"EMILY: Come in, come in."
"LORELAI: Ooh, you look tenser than usual. What's wrong?"
"EMILY: Oh, it's your father. I wanted him to go upstairs and clean up, but I can't pry him away from that partner of his."
"LORELAI: Hm. Digger's here?"
"EMILY: They're in the study doing something computery. When did we suddenly become so dependent on computers?"
"[Richard and Jason walk out of the study]"
"EMILY: Finally."
"RICHARD: Now how far can I go, Jason?"
"JASON: Uh, as far as you want. It should work anywhere."
"RICHARD: Ah, fantastic."
"EMILY: Richard, our company's here."
"RICHARD: We have company?"
"LORELAI: Oh, actually, it's just me."
"RICHARD: Oh, well, I suppose you're company. Say, are you and Rory wireless?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, we're pretty wired most of the time."
"EMILY: Why are you carrying that?"
"RICHARD: We're testing it. Jason here has just helped me hook up a wireless network for the house. Wi-Fi, it's called."
"LORELAI: Oh, neat."
"EMILY: Is that necessary? Oh, Lorelai, this is Jason Stiles."
"JASON: We've met."

"EMILY: Oh, that's right."
"JASON: Great to see you again."

"RICHARD: Look at this! I'm walking around, and I'm still on the internet. Emily, I'm going to google you."
"EMILY: You are certainly not going to google me!"
"JASON: It's a search engine, Emily. He's just gonna find you out in cyberspace."
"EMILY: This sounds absurd."
"RICHARD: Nah, can't use a laptop here, Jason. The signal doesn't reach."
"EMILY: When do you plan to use it in the dark corner by the staircase, Richard?"
"RICHARD: Well, you never know."
"EMILY: I don't like the idea of your using it anywhere but your study."
"RICHARD: I'm just testing it!"

"LORELAI: So, um, how have you been these past twenty-five years?"
"JASON: Good. Hey, moved out of my parents' house."
"LORELAI: Rad."
"JASON: Love the freedom."
"LORELAI: Well, you don't have to hide the bong anymore."
"JASON: Hey, did you get any flowers lately?"
"LORELAI: Uh, several times. Apparently, I have a secret admirer."
"JASON: I signed all the cards ""Jason."""
"LORELAI: I thought it was Jason Priestley."
"JASON: You're disappointed."
"LORELAI: No, I just wish I hadn't slept with Jason Priestley."

"LORELAI: Coming along. Uh, we're gonna have horses."
"JASON: Talking horses?"
"LORELAI: No, just the regular ones."

"LORELAI: Where?"
"JASON: The inn, on horseback."
"LORELAI: Oh. So, you unwired my father, huh?"
"JASON: Per Richard's request. He wanted it."
"LORELAI: Emily doesn't."
"JASON: I cannot win with her."
"LORELAI: You're getting the triple freeze from her. It's nice. Takes the onus off her daughter."
"JASON: But the more she hates me, the more likely it is that you will go out with me."
"LORELAI: That's not necessarily the case."
"JASON: Good, because I gotta make some serious progress with her."
"LORELAI: Good luck with that."
"JASON: Maybe I should get her to invite me to dinner."
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"JASON: Hey."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. As if you control these things."
"JASON: Well, I'm not God, but I have influence."
"LORELAI: No way is she inviting you to dinner."

"JASON: Easily fixed. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Hey. How are things?"
"RORY: Surreal - on a whole new level of surreal."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"RORY: I was harangued by an incensed ballerina."
"LORELAI: That is Salvador Dali surreal. What ballerina?"
"RORY: From the ballet we went to - the one I wrote about. This girl marched up to me in the dining hall and busted me on the bad review I gave her."
"LORELAI: Uh, wait a second. Are people allowed to do that, yell at the reviewer?"
"RORY: I frown on it. I mean, it's upsetting and ridiculous. I'll probably laugh at it someday, but not today."
"LORELAI: What did you write?"
"RORY: Well, I brought it for you to read. Tell me what you think because my picky editor loved it. I mean, loved it."
"LORELAI: Sure, sure. This is very weird."
"RORY: Very read."
"[Lorelai starts to read the article]"
"LORELAI: Whoa."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, you really hated this ballet."
"RORY: Well, we both really hated it. Remember?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I do. Jeez."
"RORY: Oh, now, come on."
"LORELAI: Well, this is just so harsh."
"RORY: Again, you were there."
"LORELAI: I know, but there's something about seeing it in print. People don't write as mean as they talk, except you."
"RORY: I wrote what I felt."
"LORELAI: ""The roll around the bra strap""?"
"RORY: That was your line!"
"LORELAI: It was? I'm awful."
"RORY: And it's not even critical of the ballerina's k*ll. It's critical of the costumer's k*ll."
"LORELAI: I know, but it sounds like she couldn't fit into a standard leotard."
"RORY: She couldn't! But again, the costumer should have put her in a larger leotard."
"LORELAI: Do I see the word ""hippo"" coming up?"
"RORY: Give me the paper."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, it's just so specific."
"RORY: It's what I saw, so I wrote it. That's what the editor told me to do."
"LORELAI: Well, then you did the right thing."
"RORY: I was too harsh."
"LORELAI: You said yourself, you were supposed to be."
"[Emily walks into the room]"
"EMILY: Rory, you're here. Good."
"RORY: Hi, Grandma."
"EMILY: Don't tell me Richard's still traipsing around with that thing. Richard, please come inside and close the door."
"RICHARD: Coming, coming."
"[Richard and Jason walk in]"
"EMILY: Oh, Jason, you're still here."
"JASON: Oh, I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye to you, Emily."
"RORY: Whatcha got there, Grandpa?"
"RICHARD: A laptop. The Gilmore house is now wireless."
"RORY: Cool."
"EMILY: And the laptop is now going back in its case because dinner is ready."
"JASON: I'll be taking off everybody. I've got a cheeseburger waiting for me."
"EMILY: Goodbye, Jason."
"RICHARD: A cheeseburger? That's not a proper meal."
"JASON: Oh, please, Richard, it's my favorite meal. I've had one for dinner three times this week."
"RICHARD: Oh, you're joking."
"EMILY: With the right bread and meat, a cheeseburger can make a fine meal."
"JASON: Thank you, Emily."
"RICHARD: You're defending cheeseburgers, Emily? When was the last time you had one?"
"JASON: This isn't just any cheeseburger, Richard. There's this stand that makes them special for me."
"RICHARD: A stand?"
"EMILY: I hear those can be very good."
"RICHARD: Emily, are we going to send this young bachelor out for fast food?"
"JASON: Oh, no, no, I couldn't stay. I'd be putting you out."
"RICHARD: Nonsense."
"EMILY: I'm not sure we have enough."
"RICHARD: We always have enough."
"JASON: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I wouldn't hear of it."
"RICHARD: Emily, my business partner is going to be standing outside eating a cheeseburger."
"EMILY: Jason, would you like to join us for dinner?"
"JASON: The cheeseburger will just have to wait."
"EMILY: I'll tell the cook."
"RICHARD: Cheeseburger."
"CUT TO THE DINING ROOM"
"[Richard, Emily, Lorelai, Rory, and Jason are eating dinner]"
"JASON: This food is incredible."
"RORY: Yeah. It's my first lobster thermidor."
"JASON: Your recipe?"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: Hey, can you thermidor other foods? You know, fish thermidor, uh, Spam thermidor, enchiladas thermidor?"
"EMILY: I don't think so. Cora, since we're five instead of four, Richard and I will ration if we have to."
"RICHARD: Oh, I don't think rationing will be necessary, Emily."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Mom, you can just pick off my plate."
"RICHARD: You've forgotten all about that burger, I hope."
"JASON: After the first mouthful."
"RICHARD: Good."
"JASON: You know, Richard, having a computer at home with a high-speed internet access is gonna free up your time enormously."
"RICHARD: Oh, I should say so."
"EMILY: How?"
"JASON: How is it gonna free up his time?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"JASON: Well, he'll be using email more, which means fewer phone calls with chitchat that you have to get through before you get down to business. That's what eats up most of the time."
"EMILY: Email seems very cold to me."
"JASON: But fast."
"EMILY: Fast isn't always better."
"JASON: A good point and very true."
"RICHARD: Oh, Jason was saying that you'll get use out of this system, too, Emily."
"EMILY: Me? How?"
"JASON: The internet. Have you checked it out?"
"EMILY: I'd have no use for it."
"LORELAI: I wouldn't dismiss it so fast, Mom. The internet is more than just good p*rn now."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm on it constantly."
"EMILY: What do you use it for?"
"RORY: Research like for when I can't get to the library."
"LORELAI: And for shopping."
"RORY: Yeah, shopping."
"LORELAI: A lot of shopping."
"EMILY: Shopping?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, the stores you normally have to go to, they're on the internet now."
"EMILY: But going to a nice store is half the fun of shopping. I like being greeted at the door and the bustle of people and the shoes and clothes all lined up nice and pretty."
"LORELAI: That's true."
"RORY: Yeah, we like that, too."
"EMILY: Having someone help you pick out the right thing or help you exchange it if it's not right. With the internet, what do you do? Mail it back?"
"LORELAI: We usually just forget."
"RORY: Yeah."
"EMILY: So you're just out the money?"
"RORY: Pretty much."
"EMILY: I don't get it."
"LORELAI: I don't get it anymore either."
"RORY: We should go to real stores more often."
"JASON: But the internet is really good."
"RICHARD: So, which camp was it where you two met?"
"LORELAI: Hm, it had a funny name and canoes."
"JASON: They all have funny names and canoes. Was it Camp Waziata?"
"LORELAI: Doesn't sound familiar. Which one asked me to leave?"
"RORY: You got kicked out of camp?"
"LORELAI: I tried to liberate the horses."
"JASON: Camp Chataguay. That's where we met."
"LORELAI: That's the one."
"JASON: I enjoyed camp. I made some good friends. I met your father at that camp."
"RORY: Dad, really?"
"JASON: We bunked together for a summer. Incredible athlete and a good guy - a really good guy."
"LORELAI: He hated you."
"JASON: What?"
"LORELAI: With a passion."
"JASON: No, I don't remember that."
"LORELAI: I'm pretty sure. Didn't he try to dunk your head in a toilet bowl after you heckled him during some campfire talent show?"
"JASON: No, I don't. . .oh, my God, I've been repressing that!"
"RICHARD: Oh, that doesn't sound like Christopher."
"JASON: No, it's okay, Richard. I'm positive I deserved it."
"EMILY: Rory, I've been meaning to mention to you, we read that wonderful review you wrote on the ballet. It was excellent."
"RICHARD: Oh-ho-ho-ho, you eviscerated that girl."
"RORY: I actually didn't mean to eviscerate her. I was just trying to be honest."
"RICHARD: Well, you honestly sliced her open and ripped out her guts."
"EMILY: Your pen was your knife."
"RORY: Right."
"RICHARD: I especially liked the reference to the hippo."
"RORY: That seems to be the most memorable for people."
"EMILY: And the bra strap."
"RICHARD: I should give you a copy of it to read, Jason. It's terrific."
"JASON: It sounds interesting."
"RORY: I just wrote what I thought."
"EMILY: And the line about regretting how evolution had led man to stand on two feet because it led to this night."
"LORELAI: [laughs] Sorry. I hadn't read that far."
"EMILY: Why are you apologizing? It is funny."
"LORELAI: Well, the ballerina in question had kind of a negative reaction to the whole thing."
"EMILY: So what?"
"RICHARD: Well, yes, don't feel badly about this, Rory. Sometimes people don't know at a young age that they're not good at doing something. Now that poor girl can go to business school."
"RORY: She's actually not as bad as she sounds."
"RICHARD: It's rare to read a truthful review."
"EMILY: I was going to go see that ballet, and now I don't have to. Thank you."
"RORY: You're welcome, I guess."
"RICHARD: We were just b*rned by a dishonest review in the Courant."
"EMILY: That French restaurant."
"RICHARD: They must have had the reviewer in their pocket. The man raved about this place, and it was abominable."
"EMILY: The food was inedible. And the service - I had to snap my fingers to get our waiter's attention."
"JASON: You know, Emily, as a woman of taste, I could use your recommendation of restaurants in the area. I've been away so long, I'm just woefully out of touch."
"EMILY: Oh, I'm no more an expert than the next person."
"JASON: You're being humble."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Mom, cough it up. You've been everywhere."
"RICHARD: Multiple times."
"EMILY: Well, I guess if you're looking for a place for a business lunch, you can't do better than Portofino's. They give you attentive service without rushing you, and it's wonderful Italian food."
"JASON: Well, you can't b*at Italian. I mean, is there anyone here who doesn't love Italian?"
"RORY: Not me."
"LORELAI: Or me."
"JASON: Good to know. Anything else, Emily?"
"EMILY: You need more?"
"JASON: Please. I'm a desperate man."
"RICHARD: Well, don't be shy, Emily. You're a walking Zagat guide."
"EMILY: Well, there's always Lil's for steak."
"JASON: Steak's always good. I'm good with that any time."
"LORELAI: I love steak."
"JASON: Really? So steak is good. How about ethnic food? Indian? Thai?"
"EMILY: I personally detest Thai food."
"LORELAI: Me, too. Chinese is good."
"RICHARD: As long as it's authentic."
"JASON: So cross Thai off the list."
"LORELAI: I would."
"EMILY: Same here."
"JASON: How about something with a more romantic atmosphere?"
"EMILY: Why would you need a romantic atmosphere for business?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, why?"
"RICHARD: I'd like to know myself."
"JASON: A client might want a recommendation for him and his wife, and I would like to be prepared."
"RICHARD: My partner."
"EMILY: That would be Mill on the River."
"RICHARD: Oh, yes. Very dark, very atmospheric."
"JASON: Sounds nice."
"LORELAI: Very."
"JASON: Good, we've made progress here, but I'm monopolizing the conversation."
"EMILY: Oh, that's okay."
"JASON: Can I call you later to continue this?"
"EMILY: Absolutely. Call me sometime next week."
"JASON: I'll be sure to do that."
"CUT TO YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE"
"[Rory follows Doyle into the office]"
"DOYLE: You want to re-review the ballet?"
"RORY: Yes, I do, Doyle, because I have a brand-new perspective on it and on dance. I was ignorant before, so this would be a whole new piece."
"DOYLE: We don't re-review things."
"RORY: Well, there's a first time for everything, and I could even buy my own ticket if that's a problem."
"DOYLE: But it closed early because of your review."
"RORY: I did not know that. But it's not a problem. I'll just redo the one I already did. That ballet is seared in there, so I could just replay it in my head."
"DOYLE: But your review was great. People are still talking about it. That's pretty rare."
"RORY: Okay, okay. Well, what about just a general-interest article on the lead ballerina?"
"DOYLE: Is she the hippo?"
"RORY: No. No. She is an accomplished dancer and her life is quite fascinating. Did you know that she studied dance for fourteen years and has performed in Miami? Miami - that's pretty big. Miami."
"DOYLE: It's boring."
"RORY: Well, she almost got into Juilliard."
"DOYLE: That's not interesting either."
"RORY: Well, no, but these are simply background facts of a fascinating personal journey. A personal journey of an artist struggling against the indifference of an indifferent society, just dancing as fast as she can. Well, it's ""8 Mile"" meets ""Fame."""
"DOYLE: I know what's going on here."
"RORY: What?"
"DOYLE: You're feeling bad about the effect your article had on the people in the ballet."
"RORY: No, that's not it."
"DOYLE: We heard about the dining-hall confrontation."
"RORY: That was not really a confrontation. We were just chatting."
"DOYLE: It goes with the territory. When I was your age, I reviewed a clog-dancing team that was really bad. I mean, even compared to other clog dancers. I was merciless."
"RORY: But - but if I can't re-review it, then can I just print the things that I meant to put in and didn't have time to?"
"DOYLE: Hurting people's feelings is what we do."
"RORY: But when I become a real journalist, the people in my reviews aren't gonna live in my building."
"DOYLE: Doesn't matter. When you write for the Yale Daily News, you are a real journalist."
"RORY: I didn't mean -"
"DOYLE: And if you can't handle it, you should leave the paper."
"RORY: I don't want to leave the paper."
"DOYLE: Good. Here. Your next assignment."
"RORY: Thanks."
"DOYLE: Knock 'em dead."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs. Kim is making dinner when Lane carries a box into the kitchen]"
"MRS. KIM: Dinner is going to be a little late tonight. My gluten patties caught fire, so we're switching to spaghetti and wheat balls."
"LANE: Mama, can we talk about something?"
"MRS. KIM: What's that?"
"LANE: It's the jug for Dave."
"MRS. KIM: I gave that to you days ago. Why haven't you sent it?"
"LANE: I can't send it, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: What do you mean you can't? Of course you can. I showed you how to tape the bubble wrap."
"LANE: No, I mean, I can't!"
"MRS. KIM: What is wrong with you?"
"LANE: Mama, please listen."
"MRS. KIM: All right."
"LANE: This is important, and I want to be clear, and I want to say it right, but it's hard."
"MRS. KIM: I'm listening."
"LANE: Dave is my first boyfriend, and he's important to me - very important."
"MRS. KIM: I know that."
"LANE: And his being in California like this, it's been hard, and it's even caused some problems. But in other ways, I think it's brought us closer."
"MRS. KIM: Yes?"
"LANE: But I'm still in school and he's still in school, and while I respect you and I respect the jug and all that the jug represents - all the bright hopes and all the tradition - I cannot give Dave the jug. Not now. Maybe one day, but not now."
"MRS. KIM: Okay."
"LANE: What are you doing?"
"MRS. KIM: What do you mean?"
"LANE: You're putting it with all the clearance items?"
"MRS. KIM: So?"
"LANE: You're selling my marriage jug?"
"MRS. KIM: Your what?"
"LANE: My marriage jug."
"MRS. KIM: What's that?"
"LANE: The jug you kept to give to the boy I'm going to marry."
"MRS. KIM: What are you talking about?"
"LANE: You told me when I was like six that this was my special marriage jug that you were gonna keep on a special high shelf for the boy I'm going to marry."
"MRS. KIM: This thing?"
"LANE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: It's just a jug."
"LANE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: I probably told you that to make you stop crying. You always cried when you were little. Gave me a headache."
"LANE: It's just a jug?"
"MRS. KIM: I've got tons of them. They're hard to move."
"LANE: But -"
"MRS. KIM: We could make it a marriage jug, whatever that is."
"LANE: No, no, never mind. It doesn't matter."
"MRS. KIM: I'll send something else to Dave."
"LANE: Good."
"MRS. KIM: Oh! My wheat balls!"
"CUT TO YALE THEATER"
"[Rory walks in talking on her cell phone]"
"RORY: So, why can't you show your face at Luke's?"
"LORELAI: It's just for a while. Hey, where are you?"
"RORY: The theater. That's why I'm talking softly. I'm reviewing some music thing. So, now, why can't you go to Luke's?"
"LORELAI: I got into an argument with Luke about Nicole."
"RORY: Nicole?"
"LORELAI: They're back together. I didn't know that. I walk into Luke's and there she is."
"RORY: And he hadn't told you?"
"LORELAI: No, and I was the very picture of awkwardness, and basically, I just fled. And when I saw Luke later, we got into a fight about it, and I told him his coffee pots were stupid."
"RORY: So it was very sophisticated."
"LORELAI: He is so guarded, so uncooperative."
"RORY: You know, you should probably get over your problem with Luke being uncooperative."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't want there to be weirdness between me and Nicole if she's back in our lives. I mean, Luke has gotta get it through his thick skull that whoever is in his life is in my life, too."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: That's not a little stalkery?"
"LORELAI: No. We are a small, close-knit community."
"RORY: So, you're gonna tell Luke about Jason?"
"LORELAI: What about him?"
"RORY: Well, there's something happening there."
"LORELAI: Not really."
"RORY: There was a palpable vibe."
"LORELAI: Palpable to everyone?"
"RORY: Just me. Grandma and Grandpa were oblivious."
"LORELAI: Hey, would that be crazy?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: For us to go out together?"
"RORY: All three of us?"
"LORELAI: Jason and I."
"RORY: A little."
"LORELAI: Well, yeah, I haven't decided."
"RORY: Well, I'm happy to report that there have been no more run-ins with the ballerina."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: We're not destined to be buddies anytime soon, but sometimes you have to make an enemy."
"LORELAI: When you have a job to do. . ."
"RORY: Then you have a job to do. It's starting, I gotta go."
"LORELAI: Okay. Have fun."
"RORY: I will."

"OPEN ON THE SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking toward Luke's Diner]"
"LORELAI: ""Twenty-three is old. It's almost twenty-five, which is, like, almost mid-twenties."""
"RORY: She did not say that."
"LORELAI: She did say that."
"RORY: It seems a little wrong that Jessica Simpson is alive and well and Roy got eaten by his tiger."
"LORELAI: Aw. Survival of the fittest, baby."
"[They walk into the diner]"
"LORELAI: Oh, man, this place is packed."
"RORY: Damn that Zagat guide."
"LORELAI: Only the loser mini-table is open."
"RORY: What do we do?"
"LORELAI: Time to hover. You take the old couple, I'll hit the cybergeek."
"RORY: Got it. [walks over to an older couple eating] Hello."
"LORELAI: [walks over to a guy working on a laptop] Hello."
"[A few minutes later, they slide two tables together and sit down]"
"LORELAI: That was some of the best hovering I've ever seen you do."
"RORY: I was taught by the best."
"LORELAI: But the focus - you never blinked. And the sneeze - so tiny, so dainty, so terrifying to the old."
"RORY: Luke's gonna be mad. I mean, he hates it when we commandeer two tables during rush hour."
"LORELAI: Oh, he only hated it that one time."
"RORY: What time?"
"LORELAI: The time when we did it and he was mad."
"RORY: He's hated it every time we've done it."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: No, only the one time."
"RORY: Which time?"
"LORELAI: The time we did it and he was mad."
"RORY: You're gonna do this to Luke, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: 'Til he's so dizzy he throws up."
"RORY: Nice. Calendars?"
"LORELAI: Let's do it. Okay, so, uh, your finals-induced hibernation period is setting in. . ."
"RORY: Monday."
"LORELAI: Okay. So how about, uh, Sunday we have a major Sephora fix, maybe a movie - sort of a see-ya day before you go bye-bye?"
"RORY: Throw in a pedicure and you got a deal."
"LORELAI: Done."
"[Luke walks over]"
"LUKE: Hey. Coffee's gonna be ready in a sec. You know what you want?"
"LORELAI: Oh, um, well, we need napkins to cover this big, wide, expansive table."
"LUKE: Okay. Uh, hey, are you in the mood for pancakes?"
"LORELAI: Pancakes, sure, yeah. I guess we have enough space for pancakes."
"LUKE: 'Cause I'm making pumpkin pancakes and it comes with homemade cinnamon butter."
"RORY: You made cinnamon butter?"
"LUKE: This morning."
"LORELAI: Wow. I bet the other people who would love a table right now but can't have one 'cause they're all taken would love pumpkin pancakes with homemade cinnamon butter."
"LUKE: I'll get your coffee."
"LORELAI: Hey, hold on."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: We're sitting at two tables."
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: You hate that. That makes you mad."
"LUKE: Only the one time."
"LORELAI: Why are you so sunny this morning?"
"LUKE: Well, actually, I finally hired some help."
"RORY: Oh, good for you."
"LUKE: Yeah, I figured I needed the help. What the hell, get a kid in here to pick up the slack, ya know? I kind of feel like a weight's been lifted, ya know?"
"LORELAI: Sounds very sensible."
"LUKE: Let me get your food going. [walks away]"
"RORY: Okay, so, talk to me."
"LORELAI: Talk to you about what?"
"RORY: Talk to me about Jason."
"LORELAI: There's nothing to talk about."
"RORY: Oh, come on. I'm in a serious romantic dry spell. I need to live vicariously through somebody."
"LORELAI: He has called."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: He has sent things."
"RORY: Pipe b*mb?"
"LORELAI: Flowers, candy."
"RORY: Even better."
"LORELAI: But I don't know, he's my father's partner, I've known him forever. I mean, can you imagine if I actually went out with someone from my 'hood?"
"RORY: Do you like him?"
"LORELAI: Well, he's completely not my type, but he does have a thing and the smarts and he does keep up."
"RORY: Maybe you should just go out with him and see what happens."
"LORELAI: No. Dad would flip and Mom hates him, so she would see it as some sort of personal attack and I'm just getting her off me for spilling wine on the carpet."
"RORY: When did you do that?"
"LORELAI: Ninth grade."
"RORY: Huh."
"LORELAI: Things are quiet now. I just wanna keep them quiet."
"[A bell dings]"
"LUKE: [calls] Hey, Brennon, pick up."
"RORY: Oh, my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: He hired Brennon Lewis."
"LORELAI: You know him?"
"RORY: I went to junior high with him."
"LORELAI: And?"
"RORY: Ew!"
"LORELAI: He doesn't look that bad."
"RORY: He's the boy who dissected a frog, did not wash his hands, and then ate a sandwich."
"LORELAI: Ew!"
"RORY: He's like the lost Farrelly brother. He's so stupid. He watched ""The Breakfast Club"" and decided to tape his own butt cheeks together."
"LORELAI: Okay, so Mensa's not sending him a t-shirt yet, but Luke has hired him so we have to give him a chance."
"[Brennon brings their plates to the table]"
"BRENNON: You have the pancakes?"
"LORELAI: We sure do."
"RORY: Hi, Brennon."
"BRENNON: Hey."
"RORY: Rory Gilmore. Um, we went to school together."
"BRENNON: Yeah?"
"RORY: You don't remember. Biology - the frog?"
"BRENNON: There have been a lot of frogs, man."
"RORY: Okay. Thanks for the food."
"BRENNON: Yep. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Your kids will be gorgeous."

"CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA"
"[Rory, Paris, and Richard are eating at a table]"
"RICHARD: This roommate of mine in sophomore year - we absolutely hated him. He was, in addition to being a complete nincompoop, rather a chubby lad. So one night, we tied him in between two mattresses and threw him out the window."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: I'm writing that one down."
"RORY: Was he okay?"
"RICHARD: Oh, he was fine. He went to sleep. He woke up in the morning and picked up right where he left off."
"RORY: Man."
"RICHARD: We wound up throwing him out the window every night for a month, and then he transferred."
"RORY: Well, do you think you guys tossing him out the window on a regular basis had something to do with that decision?"
"RICHARD: Well, it crossed our minds, yes. However, we were young and full of energy. Every day was an adventure. No challenge was too great. We wanted to change the world."
"PARIS: This is so great. Richard, I want to thank you for inviting me to lunch."
"RICHARD: Well, you're very welcome, Paris. How often does a man like me get the chance to entertain two such lovely and intelligent young ladies?"
"PARIS: You are a honey-tongued devil, aren't you, Dick?"
"RICHARD: So, tell me, what are your plans for the game?"
"RORY: The what?"
"RICHARD: The game. The Harvard-Yale game."
"PARIS: I'm going. I already have my ticket. I bought it a month ago."
"RORY: You did?"
"PARIS: It's the game, Rory. It's a memory - a college memory, and I intend on having as many college memories as possible."
"RICHARD: Your grandmother and I have attended every one of these games for the past 32 years. We always buy a block of seats, and we got one for you. So how about it? We'd love to take you."
"RORY: And I would love to go."
"RICHARD: Good. It'll be a wonderful day."
"PARIS: It will be a day to remember."
"[A man stops at their table]"
"ASHER: Richard?"
"RICHARD: Asher! Oh, look at you!"
"ASHER: Good to see you."
"RICHARD: Good to see you."
"PARIS: [quietly to Rory] Your grandfather knows Asher Fleming? That's amazing. I read his latest book four times. He was on Charlie Rose last week and he almost kept me awake."
"RORY: Well, I didn't know he knew him."
"PARIS: I wonder if I can get an interview with him for the paper."
"RORY: What if I want an interview with him for the paper?"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Well, he's my grandfather."
"PARIS: You're stealing my interview."
"RORY: No, I'm just making you crazy."
"PARIS: Like that's hard. Feel proud."
"RICHARD: Girls, I'd like to introduce you to a former classmate of mine - Asher Fleming. Asher, this is my granddaughter, Rory."
"RORY: Hello."
"ASHER: A pleasure to meet you."
"RICHARD: And her friend, Paris Geller."
"ASHER: Paris."
"PARIS: I saw you on Charlie Rose. You were good."
"ASHER: Thank you."
"PARIS: Not too self-important, you made your point, and managed to look remotely interested when Charlie babbled on pretentiously about nothing."
"ASHER: Well, Charlie Rose is a good friend of mine."
"PARIS: Whatever. Listen, professor, I'd love to do a profile on you for the paper. Nothing puffy. Straight-up, hard-hitting, uncensored. Your views, no slant. Tomorrow work for you?"
"ASHER: Well, I'll, uh, have to check my schedule. I do teach, you know."
"PARIS: Sure, you gotta pay the bills."
"ASHER: Richard, terrific to see you again. Let's have lunch next week."
"RICHARD: Consider it a date."
"ASHER: Splendid."
"RICHARD: Right."
"ASHER: Goodbye, ladies. [walks away]"
"PARIS: I'm a fan! I could've opened with that, couldn't I have?"
"RORY: Then you wouldn't be you."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks in and checks the answering machine]"
"JASON: [on answering machine] Okay, see, a better man, a smarter man, a different man, would take into account the fact that flowers, candy, and numerous phone calls have gone completely unnoticed by you. Those men would get a clue, have some pride, grow a pair, and move on. Oh, well. Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Richard and Emily, mother of Rory, and friend to all, would you join me for dinner on Saturday night? Please call me back because I will someday find my pathetic threshold and stop trying."
"[Lorelai picks up the phone and calls Jason]"
"JASON: This is Jason."
"LORELAI: This is Lorelai."
"JASON: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: No, I'm not."
"JASON: You're really calling me back?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I am."
"JASON: Is there someone there who could document this - a photographer or a really fast painter?"
"LORELAI: See, you get the girl to call you back and then you give her a hard time."
"JASON: You're right, I apologize. So, how are you?"
"LORELAI: I'm fine, and you?"
"JASON: Uh, I don't know. I've got a slight suspicion you've called to tell me you're not available for dinner on Saturday night, and that's gonna bum me out."
"LORELAI: Look, Jason -"
"JASON: Okay, before you continue, just let me say that I got us reservations at the China Garden."
"LORELAI: Ah, you're kidding."
"JASON: Very hot ticket in town. Good food, great bar, quite a scene."
"LORELAI: How did you do that?"
"JASON: Pulled a few strings, greased a few palms, sold myself to a sous-chef - a very tender man, I might add."
"LORELAI: I just want you to be happy."
"JASON: So, long story short - table for two at 8:30. You need a little black dress."
"LORELAI: I am so incredibly tempted."
"JASON: But?"
"LORELAI: But you work with my father. You're hated by my mother. You come from my world."
"JASON: You find me repulsive."
"LORELAI: No, I don't, and I wish I did."
"JASON: Okay, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna keep the reservation and go by myself. I've been reading about this place for months, and personally, I would like to see what all the fuss is about."
"LORELAI: Do you understand at all where I'm coming from?"
"JASON: Nope, but that's okay."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry, Jason."
"JASON: Me, too. I bet you look good in one of those little black dresses."
"LORELAI: Well, yes, I do."
"JASON: Goodbye, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Bye, Jason."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily, and Richard are eating dinner]"
"EMILY: It's ten o'clock at night and suddenly I hear this terrible racket. So I go outside and there is May Richmond sneaking a 6-foot Rudolph into her garage."
"RICHARD: That woman is working my last nerve."
"LORELAI: So what?"
"RICHARD: So what? Don't you know what this means?"
"LORELAI: I'm racking my brain."
"EMILY: They're going to put a giant plastic reindeer on their roof."
"RICHARD: Which is right next to our roof."
"LORELAI: So, what, are you scared they'll keep you up all night playing reindeer games?"
"RICHARD: They can't light them up. The homeowners association has very strict rules about the amount of lights that you can display in front of your house, and they already have those lawn twinklers."
"EMILY: They could give up their lawn twinklers and focus solely on the reindeer."
"RICHARD: I don't know. They were awfully proud of their twinklers last year. It was all they talked about."
"LORELAI: Okay, guys - take a step back, examine the conversation you're having, and spend some time apart."
"RORY: May I have some more roast, please, Grandma?"
"EMILY: Of course you may."
"LORELAI: It's really good tonight, Mom."
"EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai."
"RICHARD: Oh, by the way, Rory, we will pick you up in front of your residence hall tomorrow morning, nine o'clock sharp."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow? What's happening tomorrow?"
"EMILY: Tomorrow's the game."
"LORELAI: Oh, the game. . ."
"RICHARD: The game. The Harvard-Yale game."
"LORELAI: Right, right. Football?"
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Why does the question ""Football?"" get a ""Lorelai""?"
"RICHARD: Yes, it's football - the most important football game of the entire year. All of Yale will be there."
"LORELAI: Oh, cool. Can I go?"
"RICHARD: You want to go to a football game?"
"LORELAI: Well, if it's such a big deal, absolutely."
"EMILY: But you don't like football."
"LORELAI: Well, no, I'm not the diehard fan that, say, you are, Mom, but it's Rory's school."
"RICHARD: You won't get bored?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, of course I'll get bored, but that's when the ""South Park"" impressions kick in."
"EMILY: Lorelai, we have invited friends - important people."
"LORELAI: I'm kidding, Mom. I can only do Cartman."
"RICHARD: So, you want to go?"
"LORELAI: Yup."
"EMILY: You're sure about this?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely positive."
"RICHARD: Well, I guess we could uninvite someone."
"EMILY: Cecil, perhaps."
"RICHARD: Or Donlon."
"EMILY: Donlon just had his colon removed."
"RICHARD: Well, Cecil then. I guess I should call him now, give him time to get another ticket."
"EMILY: I'll call his wife."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"[Emily and Richard leave the room]"
"RORY: What is wrong with you?"
"LORELAI: What is wrong with you? Why didn't you get me a ticket to the game?"
"RORY: I was saving you, dummy."
"LORELAI: Saving me from what?"
"RORY: You hate football."
"LORELAI: So do you."
"RORY: Yeah, I know I hate football, but I couldn't get out of it. You could."
"LORELAI: Okay, so I have to go watch a football game. At least I get to hang with you before finals."
"RORY: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Of course. I mean, what's a football game last? Hour, hour and a half? Longer than an hour and a half? Are you kidding me?"
"RICHARD: Damn it. Emily, Cecil's the one who had his colon removed. I'm calling Donlon."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: I hate football."
"RORY: I tried to get you out of it."
"LORELAI: Well, you should have tried harder."
"RORY: Next time. Where's Luke?"
"LORELAI: Probably in bed where the rest of the world is on a Saturday. Did I put on underwear?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I think I forgot to put on underwear. Can you check? [pause] Did I just ask you to check if I put on underwear?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: I hate football."
"RORY: You just need coffee."
"LORELAI: Oh, no."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Froggy."
"RORY: Brennon?"
"LORELAI: I hate that kid."
"RORY: I thought we were gonna give him a chance."
"LORELAI: Yeah, chance ended when he dumped a chili-bean omelet on me the other day."
"RORY: What do we do? Oh, he's coming over."
"[Brennon walks over]"
"BRENNON: What can I do for you, chicas?"
"RORY: Oh, we'd just like to order, please."
"BRENNON: Go ahead."
"LORELAI: I'll have the cheese omelet, extra cheddar, no Jack, sourdough toast, two bacons, two sausages. . .you're not writing this down."
"BRENNON: Don't need to. Continue."
"LORELAI: Two bacons, two sausages, one pancake. . .I would really like you to write this down."
"BRENNON: Trust me, it's all stored. What would you like?"
"RORY: Rye toast."
"BRENNON: You want that toasted?"
"RORY: Sure, why not?"
"BRENNON: Got it. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Rye toast?"
"RORY: My odds are way better than yours."
"LANE: Brennon!"
"BRENNON: Oh, nice volume."
"LANE: This is a box of doughnuts."
"BRENNON: Yeah?"
"LANE: It's supposed to be a box of bagels."
"BRENNON: What, they both have holes in them, right?"
"LANE: We've already had this conversation. Get me the bagels, get me the bagels! Go. Now. Bye."
"KIRK: Excuse me, can I get a napkin?"
"BRENNON: Yeah, sure. [pulls one from his pocket and drops it on the table]"
"KIRK: Excuse me, can I get a napkin to put my napkin on?"
"LANE: You know, this is so completely unfair. I didn't even know Luke was looking for someone. I would love to work here."
"RORY: Your mother would have let you?"
"LORELAI: I mean, Luke is a man. With man parts, we think."
"LANE: Luke's is one of the few Mrs. Kim-approved places. No alcohol, walking distance to the church, and you can see my house from here. I totally need the money, and instead I get to return a box of doughnuts once a day."
"[Brennon brings a plate to the table]"
"BRENNON: Rye toast."
"RORY: Told ya."
"BRENNON: You wanted, uh, something, right?"
"LORELAI: Oh, excuse me just a second, won't you?"
"BRENNON: Sure."
"[Lorelai walks over to Luke at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Uh, we're going to the Harvard-Yale game."
"LUKE: You're going to the Harvard-Yale game? You know what they do at the Harvard-Yale game?"
"LORELAI: They make babies?"
"LUKE: They play football."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know they pay football."
"LUKE: And you're supposed to watch them play football."
"LORELAI: Let's not talk about me anymore. Let's talk about you. I'm worried."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Ever since you hired Brennon, the little spark has gone out of your eyes."
"LUKE: It has?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it has. And I am here to tell you that it is hell watching you go through this, so I think for your own sake, you should fire Froggy."
"LUKE: Froggy?"
"LORELAI: Uh, Brennon."
"LUKE: You want me to fire Brennon, why?"
"LORELAI: The spark. Remember the spark?"
"LUKE: Why do you want me to fire Brennon?"
"LORELAI: Come back, little spark, come back."
"LUKE: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: He doesn't write the orders down, he never brings you food that's hot or yours, he can't distinguish bagels from doughnuts, he hands out butt napkins, and he has worn that Foreigner t-shirt every single day since he started working here and he doesn't know who they are. I asked him."
"LUKE: What are butt napkins?"
"LORELAI: Kirk needed a napkin, and he pulled one out of his back pocket."
"LUKE: Hey, Bren?"
"BRENNON: Yeah, boss?"
"LUKE: Did you give Kirk a napkin out of your back pocket?"
"BRENNON: Yeah."
"LUKE: Don't."
"BRENNON: Okay."
"LORELAI: That's it? What about all the other stuff?"
"LUKE: Look, you're just used to me. Give him time."
"LORELAI: Have you heard about the frog, the hands, and the sandwich?"
"LUKE: No, but I heard about the rabbi, the priest, and the duck."
"LORELAI: You're not taking me seriously."
"LUKE: Hey, Bren, get Ms. Gilmore a cup of hot coffee, will ya? Give the kid a chance, all right? He's helping me out a great deal - decaf - and I have faith in him. All he needs is a little more time - black top - to learn the ropes and he'll be fine."
"LORELAI: Where did he go?"
"LUKE: Uh, I don't know."
"CUT TO YALE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the ground in front of Rory's dorm]"
"LORELAI: Where are they all going? It's Saturday morning, they should be in bed."
"RORY: They're excited about life. It's a college thing."
"LORELAI: How come you're not excited about life?"
"RORY: I find nothing exciting before eleven."
"EMILY: Yoo-hoo, girls, over here!"
"LORELAI: God, who's yoo-hooing? Oh, my God."
"EMILY: Lorelai, Rory."
"RICHARD: It's a fine day for football."
"LORELAI: And funny hats."
"EMILY: If you're going to continue sitting on the ground like that, you should get yourself a saxophone and a tip cup."
"LORELAI: Sorry. Up."
"RORY: Right."
"EMILY: Lorelai, what are you wearing?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm sorry, you're horrified by what I'm wearing?"
"EMILY: You're wearing crimson."
"LORELAI: I'm not wearing crimson."
"RICHARD: Oh, she can't go like that."
"RORY: Crimson is Harvard's color."
"RICHARD: That's a very dangerous choice to make today, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm not wearing crimson. I'm wearing red."
"EMILY: Same thing."
"LORELAI: Very different."
"EMILY: Look at Rory. Rory is dressed in Yale colors."
"RICHARD: Why can't you be like Rory?"
"EMILY: Rory looks perfect."
"LORELAI: Rory got dressed five minutes before you got here, and she's wearing my sweater."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Well, I could just as easily have been the one dressed right."
"EMILY: You can wear my jacket."
"LORELAI: Do you have a samurai sword under those pom-poms, Mom? Because you're gonna have to ""k*ll Bill"" me to get me into that -"
"EMILY: Arm."
"LORELAI: Yes, ma'am."
"RICHARD: Uh, what have you got there, Rory?"
"RORY: Fig Newtons."
"RICHARD: Fig Newtons?"
"RORY: A little dessert for later."
"[Emily and Richard chuckle]"
"RORY: What's so funny?"
"LORELAI: We got the jumbo pack. We're not cheap."
"EMILY: I'm sorry, Rory, we didn't mean to laugh at you. We love your Fig Newtons."
"RICHARD: We will honor them and eat them proudly."
"LORELAI: They're just Fig Newtons, guys. Don't get all freaky on us."
"RICHARD: Well, let's get going."
"LORELAI: So, what time does the game start?"
"RICHARD: One."
"RORY: One?"
"LORELAI: Then why the hell did we have to meet you at nine?"
"EMILY: Is it absolutely necessary for you to talk like Sharon Osbourne?"
"LORELAI: You're the one with the dirty button."
"RICHARD: There's much more to the big game day than the game, Lorelai. There are all kinds of rituals and traditions we Gilmores take part in. First off, a visit to Dan."
"EMILY: A visit to Dan."
"LORELAI: Who's Dan?"
"RICHARD: Come along, ladies."
"LORELAI: Who's Dan?"
"EMILY: Button your coat."
"LORELAI: Who's Dan?"
"[They walk over to a glass display case with a stuffed bulldog inside]"
"RICHARD: Girls, I'd like you to meet Dan - the original Handsome Dan."
"EMILY: The very first Yale mascot."
"RORY: Oh, my."
"RICHARD: Just look at him, will you. Strong, determined, the very essence of dignity."
"LORELAI: Got cotton stuffed in his butt. How dignified is that?"
"RICHARD: You will not sully the name of Dan. This dog has been the inspiration for many a young man."
"EMILY: And young woman."
"RICHARD: We salute you, Dan."
"EMILY: Time for a toast."
"LORELAI: Seriously?"
"RICHARD: Oh, it's a tradition. Here we go. The Rory flask."
"RORY: Oh."
"RICHARD: And the fun flask."
"EMILY: Thank you."
"RICHARD: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Fun flask, please."
"RICHARD: All right, give our boys the strength to do battle yet again for the honor of Yale, and help us send the Harvard boys home in a body bag. Dan, we salute you."
"EMILY: To Dan."
"LORELAI: To Dan."
"RORY: To Dan."
"LORELAI: Mm, I like football."
"RICHARD: I must admit, throughout the years, I have often hoped to be able to share this day with my granddaughter. It's selfish, I know, but I am thrilled to be here with you, Rory."
"LORELAI: To Rory. Two more of these and I'm gonna start to understand your outfit."
"RICHARD: [chants] Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow, Eli Yale. . ."
"LORELAI: What is he doing?"
"CROWD: Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow. . ."
"LORELAI: [gasps] They're joining him."
"RORY: Apparently, everyone has a fun flask."
"EMILY: You know, Cole Porter wrote that song."
"LORELAI: Was that before he learned to write songs?"
"CROWD: . . .That is the sign we hail! Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow, Eli Yale!"
"EMILY: All right, everyone, time to move on."
"RICHARD: Yes, we have a lot of things to get to."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I hear there's a squirrel encased in concrete next door. We have to burn incense, dance around his tail with nuts in our mouths."
"EMILY: What can I possibly do to stop you?"
"LORELAI: A little more of the fun flask might do the trick."
"EMILY: That's all until we eat."
"RORY: Where are we going to eat?"
"RICHARD: Uh, it's a tailgate party."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, a what?"
"RICHARD: Oh, well, don't look so shocked, Lorelai. Tailgating was invented at Yale."
"LORELAI: Tailgating like tailgating? Like a beer and a hot dog in the parking lot?"
"EMILY: Walk a little faster, please."
"LORELAI: Did they say ""tailgating""?"
"RORY: I think so."
"LORELAI: I wanted to make sure it wasn't the fun flask talking."
"EMILY: Girls."
"[They walk to the parking lot]"
"LORELAI: Oh, so this is tailgating."
"RORY: It smells so good."
"LORELAI: [to a guy barbecuing] Hey, how are ya? Go, Yale, huh? Hi, I'm Lorelai."
"BENNY: I'm Benny."
"LORELAI: Wow, great to meet you, Benny. Tell me about this barbecue sauce."
"EMILY: Please don't harass people. Your daughter goes to this school."
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom, I'd like you to meet Benny. Benny, this is my mother, Emily. We were thinking a summer wedding."
"EMILY: It's nice to meet you. We're over there."
"LORELAI: I don't care where you are. I have found my place in life. It's here, right next to -"
"RORY: Oh, my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Look."
"[They see the elaborate tailgating area that Richard and Emily have set up]"
"EMILY: Richard, make sure he doesn't burn those."
"LORELAI: See ya, Benny. Okay, let's tailgate. I really like football."
"[At the tailgating area, Lorelai pours Richard a drink from the fun flask]"
"LORELAI: How's that?"
"RICHARD: Oh, that's fine if we were in Utah."
"LORELAI: Message received. [pours him some more]"
"EMILY: Don't keep drinking that, Richard. I'm making my Bloody Mary's."
"RICHARD: You have been working on your Bloody Mary's for an hour now."
"EMILY: Rome wasn't built in a day. [sets a glass on the table] Taste that, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: [takes a sip] Ugh! Hooyah!"
"EMILY: Too strong?"
"LORELAI: Just a tad."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm sitting across from it and I'm looking for a lampshade to wear."
"EMILY: All right, all right."
"RICHARD: Rory, come with me. I want to introduce you to some good friends of mine."
"RORY: Sure."
"[Richard and Rory walk away]"
"EMILY: He is so proud of that girl."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: Sometimes that's all he can talk about."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, it's a pretty good subject."
"RICHARD: [to a group of men] Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my granddaughter, Rory, class of 2007."
"EMILY: So, any word from that little ex-hoodlum of hers?"
"LORELAI: No, Jess seems to be gone for good."
"EMILY: How is she?"
"LORELAI: She's Rory. She's stoic. She's a lot like Dad."
"EMILY: She is, isn't she? And what about you? Any men snooping around?"
"LORELAI: Uh, just on trash day."
"EMILY: There must be someone."
"LORELAI: No, no, no one."
"EMILY: All right. Any weaker and it would simply be tomato juice."
"LORELAI: Mm, very nice."
"EMILY: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Mm."
"EMILY: Perfect."
"[Paris walks over to them]"
"PARIS: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi, Paris."
"PARIS: Is Rory here?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, she's over there with her grandfather. She'll be right back. Mom, do you know Paris?"
"EMILY: Of course I know Paris. She came to Rory's sixteenth birthday party. Nice to see you again. Would you like some lemonade?"
"PARIS: No, thank you. I won't be here long. Oh, Rory, good. Here. [hands her a camera]"
"RORY: What's this?"
"PARIS: I want you to take a win/lose photo."
"RORY: A what?"
"PARIS: A photo as if we won and a photo as if we lost. That way, I have it to remember the day by."
"RORY: Why don't you just wait until we win or lose to take the photo?"
"PARIS: Oh, please, I'm already so bored out of my mind, I'm thinking of transferring to Princeton for the hell of it. There's no way I'm gonna make it to the game. Just take the picture so I can go home."
"RORY: Okay. We won. [takes pictures] We lost. [takes picture] We're done."
"PARIS: I'm out of here."
"RICHARD: Oh, hello, Paris. Join us for some food?"
"PARIS: No, thanks, Richard. Oh, by the way, thanks again for introducing me to Asher Fleming."
"RICHARD: Oh, did you get your interview?"
"PARIS: No, not yet, but I'm working on it."
"RICHARD: Well, I pity him if he tries to resist too long."
"PARIS: Oh, so do I. Bye."
"RORY: Bye, Paris."
"[Paris leaves]"
"EMILY: She's an odd little duck, that one."
"RICHARD: Don't I get one of those?"
"EMILY: Well, of course you do."
"[A woman walks over]"
"PENNILYN: Richard, Emily, hello."
"EMILY: Pennilyn."
"RICHARD: Nice to see you."
"PENNILYN: How are things?"
"EMILY: Perfect. You?"
"PENNILYN: Lovely. How's work?"
"RICHARD: Just fine. How's Stephen?"
"PENNILYN: Oh, you know."
"EMILY: This is our daughter, Lorelai, and our granddaughter, Rory."
"PENNILYN: Hello."
"EMILY: It's been so long, we must catch up."
"PENNILYN: You'll call?"
"EMILY: Of course."
"PENNILYN: Well, then. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, wait, are you Pennilyn Lott, my dad's college sweetheart?"
"PENNILYN: Yes."
"LORELAI: You're my almost-mommy."
"PENNILYN: Well, I suppose you could put it that way."
"LORELAI: I'm so glad to finally meet you. Let me ask you something - would you have let me get a pony?"
"EMILY: I'll call you, Pennilyn."
"PENNILYN: Uh, yes, I look forward to it."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Pennilyn leaves]"
"EMILY: Lorelai! Does anything work above your neck?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, what?"
"EMILY: What were you thinking?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I was just trying to talk to her."
"EMILY: We do not talk to Pennilyn Lott."
"LORELAI: Ugh, I -"
"EMILY: We run into her once a year. We say hello, goodbye, and that is it. We do not have conversations, we do not talk about our lives."
"LORELAI: But Mom -"
"EMILY: We do not joke with Pennilyn Lott. We do not refer to Pennilyn Lott as anything but Pennilyn Lott, and I would appreciate you remembering that."
"LORELAI: Okay, seriously time for the fun flask."

"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Luke walks by the bakery, where a line is formed on the sidewalk outside the door]"
"LUKE: Hey, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: Hi, sweetie."
"LUKE: Gypsy."
"GYPSY: Hey Luke."
"LUKE: Reverend Skinner."
"REVEREND: Afternoon, son."
"LUKE: Oh, hey, Kirk, I got that cheese in you like."
"KIRK: The Pepper Jack?"
"LUKE: Pepper Jack, yes. Anyway, it's here, it's in if you're coming by today."
"KIRK: Okay."
"LUKE: Are you?"
"KIRK: Am I coming by today?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"KIRK: No, not today."
"LUKE: Kirk, listen, I got that cheese just for you. Do not leave me with three pounds of Pepper Jack on my hands."
"KIRK: I won't."
"LUKE: What are you doing here anyway?"
"KIRK: Standing in line."
"LUKE: Why are you standing in line?"
"KIRK: Because I'm a follower."
"LUKE: Patty?"
"MISS PATTY: Yes, Luke?"
"LUKE: What are all these people standing in line for?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, it seems like such a nice day for pie."
"LUKE: What's going on here?"
"KIRK: I'm sticking to the pie story."
"LUKE: Why do you need a pie story, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Ask Gypsy."
"GYPSY: Don't pawn this off on me."
"LUKE: Will somebody tell me what the hell is going on?"
"REVEREND: Luke -"
"LUKE: Oh, sorry, Reverend."
"REVEREND: No, I was just gonna tell you what's going on."
"LUKE: Oh, good. Go ahead."
"REVEREND: We're all here for lunch."
"LUKE: Since when does Weston's serve lunch?"
"MISS PATTY: We're sorry, Luke. We really are."
"LUKE: You're sorry about what?"
"KIRK: About not eating at your diner anymore."
"LUKE: You're not eating at my diner anymore? Why?"
"MISS PATTY: We hate the kid."
"LUKE: Brennon?"
"KIRK: Brennon, Satan, whatever."
"LUKE: Wait a minute, don't you think you're all just overreacting a little bit? He's just a kid."
"GYPSY: A really weird kid. He'll be looking directly at you and start laughing. No one knows why. He's just there, laughing."
"LUKE: He laughs? That's why you hate him? The kid laughs?"
"KIRK: You'd have to hear it."
"LUKE: I don't believe you people. You've been coming to my diner for years, and now, all of a sudden, because I give a local kid a break, try to teach him a k*ll, give him a chance to get a little extra cash, a little independence, you all just up and leave? I mean, so he's not the most popular kid in town. If I remember correctly, I wasn't exactly the most popular kid in town either."
"GYPSY: Yeah, but you didn't do that laughing thing."
"LUKE: Yeah, whatever I did, I grew up, I got responsible. This town gave me a chance, and I proved them right. Now you're all just gonna stand there and tell me that that's it, that you've given out all the passes that you had and you're not coming to my diner anymore because you don't like Brennon? Well, fine. Fine! Do not come to my diner. From now on, every day is a nice day for pie."
"[Luke starts walking toward the diner. Through the window, he sees Brennon singing and dancing on one of the tables. He walks back to the bakery line]"
"LUKE: Just give me ten minutes."

"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily and Richard are eating lunch at their tailgating area]"
"RICHARD: I think I have officially eaten a third of a cow."
"RORY: Mm, the steak is incredible."
"EMILY: I'm glad you're all enjoying it. Lorelai, how's your steak?"
"LORELAI: Why do you ask?"
"EMILY: That's it. Hand over the flask."
"LORELAI: I do not know what you're talking about. There's no flask here."
"RORY: What's going on over there?"
"EMILY: Oh, Richard, it's Dan."
"RICHARD: Dan? It's Dan! It's Dan!"
"LORELAI: I thought we already saw Dan."
"EMILY: This is the current Dan."
"RICHARD: Emily, get his bone."
"EMILY: Got it. [they walk over to the dog] Here you go, Dan."
"LORELAI: Enjoy it now. I just saw your future and it ain't good."
"[Marty walks over]"
"MARTY: Rory, hey."
"RORY: Hey, did you see Dan?"
"MARTY: Well, you can't help it. He's everywhere today in one form or another."
"RORY: I want you to meet my mom."
"LORELAI: I'll distract them, and you make a run for it. Dan, are you listening to me? Stop eating. Your freedom's at stake here."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: I was just petting him."
"RORY: I want you to meet Marty."
"LORELAI: Oh, naked guy."
"MARTY: You told your mother about me."
"RORY: Um, yeah. Well, I included some anecdotes where you were actually clothed, too."
"MARTY: Oh, I appreciate that."
"RICHARD: And who is this young man?"
"RORY: This is Marty. He lives in my residence hall."
"EMILY: It's very nice to meet you, Marty."
"RICHARD: Why did my daughter just call you ""naked guy""?"
"RORY: I now owe you money."
"MARTY: I, uh, had an unfortunate experience with a keg and a party and a need to take my clothes off and fall asleep in a hallway."
"EMILY: Oh, my goodness."
"RICHARD: Oh, please, that's nothing. I was naked an entire month my sophomore year."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Welcome to tonight's episode of ""Things I Never Needed to Know About My Father."""
"RICHARD: I and a group of like-minded young men decided to protest the new dress code by wearing silk ties and nothing else. We were written up by the dean of admissions and threatened with expulsion. We were also suddenly very popular with the ladies."
"EMILY: Ah, yes. This is exactly the kind of conversation I had hoped we would have with our granddaughter and her friend."
"RICHARD: One night in the hallway does not a true naked guy make, my friend."
"EMILY: Would you like to eat with us, Marty?"
"MARTY: Oh, I would love to. It looks amazing. But I have to go. There's kind of a party going on over on the lawn, and I actually came by to see if Rory wanted to stop by for a little while."
"RORY: Oh, I can't."
"RICHARD: Oh, nonsense, of course you can go. Go visit your friends. I insist."
"RORY: Are you sure?"
"RICHARD: We've got plenty of time before the kickoff, go."
"RORY: Okay."
"EMILY: Take this with you."
"MARTY: Thanks. It was nice meeting you. Obi-wan."
"RICHARD: Hm."
"[Rory and Marty walk away]"
"RICHARD: I like that boy."
"LORELAI: Prove it. Drop your pants."
"EMILY: All right, come on."
"LORELAI: Come on where?"
"EMILY: It's time to go to the ladies' room."
"LORELAI: It is? Was there a memo, or. . ."
"EMILY: It's an hour before kickoff. The lines won't be long. Grab your purse. You'll thank me later."
"CUT TO THE RESTROOMS"
"[Lorelai walks out]"
"LORELAI: I'll meet you right outside. [she walks over to a coffee kiosk] Coffee, please."
"GUY: Here you go."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"[Pennilyn walks over]"
"PENNILYN: Of course there's a line. Why wouldn't there be?"
"LORELAI: You know, you kind of want to hang out here anyhow."
"PENNILYN: Why is that?"
"LORELAI: Some woman just took her forty-year-old son in there."
"PENNILYN: No."
"LORELAI: He might not be forty, but the images he's gathering up in there will last until he gets there."
"PENNILYN: Why do women do that?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"PENNILYN: When I was growing up, there was such a thing as modesty. I suppose that's not in fashion now."
"LORELAI: Nope, modesty went punk."
"PENNILYN: So, I hear you're opening an inn."
"LORELAI: Well, trying to."
"PENNILYN: That sounds very exciting."
"LORELAI: It is."
"[Emily walks over]"
"EMILY: Pennilyn, we're just running into you all over the place."
"PENNILYN: Yes, you are."
"EMILY: Well, it's a nice treat. Enjoy the game."
"PENNILYN: Same to you."
"EMILY: Oops, the line's moving."
"PENNILYN: Oh, I'll see you later."
"EMILY: Yes. Let's go, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Did you see the woman with the forty-year-old kid?"
"[They return to the tailgating area]"
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily, good. I can't remember whether it's two shakes of Tabasco or four."
"EMILY: I'll do it."
"RICHARD: Mm. I did however remember how much vodka goes in there."
"EMILY: You're going to have to move if you want me to make them."
"RICHARD: But I don't want to move. I want to stand right here, dangerously close to my wife as long as. . .[a group of men starts singing]. . . Whiffenpoofs! [he goes over to sing with them]"
"EMILY: There's no celery. Sandy, I told you to cut enough celery for the entire day."
"LORELAI: Ugh, he's gonna be in so much pain tomorrow."
"EMILY: What is this? Sandy, what is this?"
"SANDY: It's the cookies."
"EMILY: It's the cookies my granddaughter brought. I told you to place them on a doily, not just dump them on a plate."
"SANDY: I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Take them, fix them. And where's the celery?"
"LORELAI: Um, I can get you celery, Mom."
"EMILY: I didn't hire you to get me celery."
"LORELAI: I know, but I'm happy to help."
"EMILY: Sandy, I don't want to ask you again."
"LORELAI: Is something wrong, Mom?"
"EMILY: No, nothing's wrong."
"[Richard walks back over with the Whiffenpoofs]"
"RICHARD: These are the best Bloody Mary's I have ever tasted. Emily, let's give these boys some refreshments."
"EMILY: We can't give them any refreshments because we don't have any celery even though I've been asking for it repeatedly for the last ten minutes."
"RICHARD: We can drink them without celery."
"EMILY: How does Pennilyn Lott know that Lorelai's opening an inn?"
"RICHARD: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: She knows that Lorelai's opening an inn. How did she know?"
"RICHARD: Well -"
"EMILY: I didn't tell her. I don't think Lorelai told her. I can't remember the last time Rory and Pennilyn had a hen party."
"LORELAI: Um, Mom. . ."
"EMILY: Once a year - that's when we talk to her. Once a year, right here at the game. We say hello, we ask about her health, we ask about her children, and if Stephen's not here, we ask about him. How did she know?"
"RICHARD: I told her."
"LORELAI: [to the Whiffenpoofs] Run."
"EMILY: When?"
"RICHARD: About six months ago. We had lunch."
"EMILY: Where?"
"RICHARD: At a restaurant."
"EMILY: What restaurant?"
"RICHARD: You don't know it."
"EMILY: Why don't I know it?"
"RICHARD: Because you've never been there."
"EMILY: How do you know I've never been there? You don't know everything about me. I don't know everything about you. I didn't know you were having lunch with Pennilyn Lott. We obviously don't know everything about each other. What restaurant?"
"RICHARD: Adele's."
"EMILY: I've never been there."
"RICHARD: We just had lunch and talked. Two old friends."
"EMILY: How nice. So, after all of these years of not having lunch and not talking, you two decide to get together and catch up. Whose idea was it?"
"RICHARD: Emily, could we discuss this in the trailer?"
"EMILY: We will discuss this right here. Whose idea was it?"
"RICHARD: I don't know. We've been having lunch once a year for many years. It's just a little tradition."
"EMILY: Every year since when?"
"RICHARD: Every year since we got married. Emily, please don't make this more dramatic than it has to be."
"EMILY: No, I certainly wouldn't want to do that."
"RICHARD: Pennilyn and I are just friends. We just wanted to keep track of each other. That was it."
"EMILY: So, you've lied to me for the last 39 years."
"RICHARD: Well, she didn't tell Stephen. It was only lunch."
"EMILY: Only lunch, yes."
"RICHARD: Emily, I -"
"EMILY: I think you should go for a walk, Richard."
"RICHARD: I'll be back before the game. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Mom, I know it was wrong, but I'm sure Dad just didn't want to get you upset."
"EMILY: Well, then perhaps he shouldn't have lied to me for the last 39 years. That's a surefire way not to get me upset."
"LORELAI: That's true, but it was just lunch."
"EMILY: It was lunch with Pennilyn Lott, Lorelai - the woman you insisted on talking to even though I told you not to."
"LORELAI: I didn't -"
"EMILY: Your stubbornness is astounding to me. I asked you over and over to please refrain from talking to her."
"LORELAI: You asked me once, and -"
"EMILY: But no, you had to push it, and now look what's happened! Are you happy?"
"LORELAI: Are you seriously blaming me for this?"
"EMILY: You had to talk to her!"
"LORELAI: I didn't have lunch with her, Mom. Dad did."
"EMILY: I wouldn't have known! If you hadn't talked to her, I wouldn't have known, and everything would have been fine!"
"LORELAI: So you'd rather just be in denial about things, Mom?"
"EMILY: Everything would have been fine!"
"LORELAI: But Dad still would have been having lunch with this woman once a year."
"EMILY: You weren't even supposed to come. It was supposed to be your father and me and Rory. You weren't supposed to come!"
"LORELAI: Okay!"
"CUT TO JASON'S OFFICE"
"[He answers the phone]"
"JASON: This is Jason Stiles."
"LORELAI: You still have those reservations?"
"JASON: Should I. . .no. Gonna let it go. I'll pick you up at eight."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"JASON: And wear something completely evil."
"LORELAI: So, horns, tail, and my Wolfowitz t-shirt?"
"JASON: Perfect."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"JASON: Bye."
"CUT TO THE CHINA GARDEN RESTAURANT"
"[Lorelai and Jason walk in]"
"LORELAI: Oh, man, this place is crazy."
"JASON: You know they flew in the top prostitutes from Hong Kong to work that coat check."
"LORELAI: Oh, God, I hope that's true. Okay, is there a star? We need a star. Bingo."
"JASON: Where?"
"LORELAI: Ted Koppel's here."
"JASON: Where?"
"LORELAI: Right there."
"JASON: Oh, dear, so he really does look like that. [to hostess] Uh, the name is Stiles, for two."
"LORELAI: I love that Ted Koppel's here."
"HOSTESS: Follow me."
"LORELAI: Look how she seats us right away."
"JASON: You like that, huh?"
"LORELAI: I do like that. Now, if she seats us next to Ted, we have to make sure to become his best friends so he invites us to all those famous newscaster parties."
"JASON: Oh, that sounds fabulous."
"[They are led into a private room with one table]"
"HOSTESS: Miss?"
"LORELAI: Yes? Oh, me? Sorry. Thank you."
"JASON: Thank you."
"HOSTESS: Your waiter will be in in a moment. [leaves]"
"JASON: Nice, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yes, very nice. Quiet. You could hear a pin drop."
"JASON: So, how are you feeling tonight? Red, white, or gin-soaked?"
"LORELAI: Red's good."
"JASON: Red it is."
"LORELAI: So, I'm sorry, is this where we're going to eat?"
"JASON: That's right."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay. Did they run out of tables or something?"
"JASON: I requested this room."
"LORELAI: You requested it?"
"JASON: Yes."
"LORELAI: You asked for it on purpose?"
"JASON: Hey, it's very hard to get this room. Everybody wants it, and now we've got it."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do, we have it. Lucky us. It's just that everything's kinda going on out there."
"JASON: So?"
"LORELAI: Well, don't you wanna be out there with everybody else?"
"JASON: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because it's fun."
"JASON: You know, all the people and the noise, you can't even hear yourself think."
"LORELAI: But that's the point of coming to a place like this."
"JASON: I thought the point of coming to a place like this would be to enjoy the food and the atmosphere."
"LORELAI: Yes, but all of the atmosphere is out there."
"JASON: You don't like the room."
"LORELAI: No, it's. . .it is weird, you know. I mean, the two of us sitting all alone in here. I feel like we're quarantined. It's like the ebola room or something."
"JASON: Okay, I don't know what to do."
"LORELAI: Why don't we ask for a table out there?"
"JASON: Oh, no, the place is booked solid."
"LORELAI: We could eat at the bar."
"JASON: I don't eat at the bar."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"JASON: I don't like stools. Your feet hang."
"LORELAI: Hey, this is a fancy place. Someone will hold them."
"JASON: Maybe we should just go."
"LORELAI: Oh, Jason. . ."
"JASON: No, you're uncomfortable. It's fine. Let's go. Ted would."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"CUT TO INSIDE JASON'S CAR"
"JASON: We could go someplace else. You must be starving."
"LORELAI: You know, I'm not. I had a lot of food today."
"JASON: Right, you tailgated. Okay, so, home?"
"LORELAI: Okay, yeah, home's fine."
"JASON: We could try this again some other time."
"LORELAI: Uh huh, absolutely. Oh my God, I'm starving."
"JASON: You just said you weren't."
"LORELAI: Well, I lied."
"JASON: Well, good, 'cause I'm starving, too."
"LORELAI: Well, you should have said something."
"JASON: Well, our date was dinner. It was implied."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay, next exit."
"JASON: What?"
"LORELAI: Get off at the next exit, do it, do it."
"JASON: Okay, doing it, doing it, doing it, doing it."
"[They pull up to a drive-thru window]"
"LORELAI: Oh, this place, hands down, the best tacos on the East Coast. You're gonna be very happy."
"JASON: Good to know."
"EMPLOYEE: Welcome to Taco Barn, may I take your order?"
"LORELAI: Hi. Um, two tacos, an order of taquitos, a beef burrito with no onions, and, uh, don't bother bagging it, that'll just slow us down. Go ahead."
"JASON: Uh, nothing for me."
"LORELAI: What?"
"JASON: No, nothing, thanks."
"LORELAI: You said you were starving."
"JASON: Yeah, I'm just not big on Mexican food."
"LORELAI: Trust me, this stuff bears no resemblance to Mexican food."
"JASON: It's okay, I'm good."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, I'm not gonna eat if you're not gonna eat."
"JASON: What is this, junior high?"
"LORELAI: No, no, I just, um. . .I don't wanna sit in a car and eat by myself."
"JASON: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because it's not fun."
"JASON: Well, does everything have to be fun for you?"
"LORELAI: When I'm on a date, yeah."
"JASON: Oh, please, come on, just get the food."
"LORELAI: No, no, let's go."
"JASON: No, the tacos. You love the tacos."
"LORELAI: I'm not hungry."
"JASON: You are too hungry."
"LORELAI: Forget it. Let's go."
"JASON: Okay, I'm going."
"CUT TO A SUPERMARKET"
"[Lorelai and Jason walk in]"
"JASON: I told you to get the tacos."
"LORELAI: Let's not do this again, okay? I just need to eat something."
"JASON: This is a supermarket."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna throw my purse at you."
"JASON: You have to cook anything you buy here."
"LORELAI: Jason, come on."
"JASON: Come on what?"
"LORELAI: There are a million things here. There's cheese and fruit and chips and a whole prepared-food section. Now grab this basket and look. Do you want to start with the salad?"
"JASON: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay. What did you just do?"
"JASON: I need razors."
"LORELAI: No, no, this is an errand."
"JASON: So?"
"LORELAI: So we're looking for food and you're running errands."
"JASON: I'm a busy man. I don't have time to do these things."
"LORELAI: We're on a date!"
"JASON: We're in a store, they're right there. Now I don't have to go tomorrow."
"LORELAI: But a date isn't about convenience. You're not supposed to be thinking about the things you need. Oh, sh**t, I'm out of toothpaste."
"JASON: Grab it."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"JASON: I need hand soap."
"LORELAI: All right. I'll grab some paper towels and meet you in the prepared-food section."
"JASON: Fine. Uh, which way is detergent?"
"LORELAI: That way."
"[They go off to separate aisles]"
"JASON: [calls] Hey, you need peas? 'Cause there's two for one."
"LORELAI: Uh, no, I'm good."
"JASON: I'm getting you a couple anyhow."
"LORELAI: Where are you?"
"JASON: Uh, let's see, there's Jell-o and tiny cocktail wieners."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm one aisle over."
"JASON: I'll be right there. [walks to her aisle] Boy, I gotta tell you, the advice about not shopping hungry couldn't be truer."
"LORELAI: Good Lord, that's a lot of food."
"JASON: Well, it's not all just food."
"LORELAI: So you won't eat fast food, but Sno Balls are okay?"
"JASON: I've never eaten them. I was curious."
"LORELAI: Sno Balls. Pink marshmallow coconut balls."
"JASON: You wouldn't be curious about pink marshmallow coconut balls? Who makes these? How did the decision to dye the coconut pink occur? Why are they shaped like a chest? Is there any dessert on the fact of the planet that could stimulate this much debate?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"JASON: What are you looking for?"
"LORELAI: Well, they usually have the mini size of these chips."
"JASON: Get the big one."
"LORELAI: I grab them on the way out of the house and this won't fit in my purse."
"JASON: Well, they must have them. Hold on."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"JASON: Just watch my Sno Balls, please."
"LORELAI: Not on the first date, mister."
"[Jason goes to talk to a store employee, then walks back over to Lorelai]"
"JASON: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"JASON: Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry."
"[The employee lets them into the storage room]"
"EMPLOYEE: Ten minutes."
"JASON: That's all we need."
"LORELAI: What are we doing here?"
"JASON: We're looking for your chips."
"LORELAI: Seriously?"
"JASON: Well, this is where they keep the goods."
"LORELAI: How did you get the guy to let us in the back room?"
"JASON: Talking people into doing things that they don't wanna do happens to be my specialty."
"LORELAI: Ooh, look, a time clock. Let's clock in. Do you wanna be Lucy or Jamal?"
"JASON: Uh, either one. What were the chips you like?"
"LORELAI: Sour cream and onion."
"JASON: Ah, got 'em."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's just like heaven."
"JASON: Here. Wanna do the honors?"
"LORELAI: Ooh, I feel so powerful."
"JASON: Well, you're holding a knife. Being armed does that to people. Wow, Cap'n Crunch. I lived on Cap'n Crunch in college."
"LORELAI: Cut him."
"JASON: Cut Cap'n Crunch? That seems a bit severe."
"LORELAI: Trust me, he's got it coming."
"JASON: Okay, I just hope Jamal doesn't get busted for this."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Jason are sitting at a table in front of the supermarket eating the food they just bought]"
"LORELAI: Mac and cheese?"
"JASON: Yeah, please, delicious."
"LORELAI: Mm."
"JASON: You know, I must say, this is a pretty nice spread we put together here."
"LORELAI: A little ingenuity."
"JASON: It's too bad they stop selling alcohol after 9:30. I mean, not that I need to be drunk to have dinner with you."
"LORELAI: Oh, the fun flask."
"JASON: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: I swiped the fun flask."
"JASON: So, tell me something."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"JASON: Why'd you change your mind?"
"LORELAI: No reason."
"JASON: You seemed to be pretty determined."
"LORELAI: Yes, I did."
"JASON: And you had some pretty good logic backing you up."
"LORELAI: I always do."
"JASON: So between the phone call where you said no and eight hours ago, what happened?"
"LORELAI: Well, I went to the Harvard-Yale game with Rory and my parents."
"JASON: Yes, that's how I get all of my girls."
"LORELAI: And, um, there was this thing with my mother. And it just, uh. . . well, she was just. . .I thought, and. . . so here we are?"
"JASON: So here we are. Um, listen. . .whatever it is your mother did today, do you think she might do it again tomorrow night?"
"LORELAI: I think there's an excellent possibility."
"JASON: Okay, I'm gonna go for the giant egg rolls. Do you want one?"
"LORELAI: Yes, please, and don't forget the hot mustard."
"JASON: Right."
"[Jason walks away. Lorelai answers her cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: So how was it?"
"LORELAI: It's still going on."
"RORY: Really, how dirty."
"LORELAI: We're at the West Hills market drinking booze out of paper cups."
"RORY: Really, how pathetic."
"LORELAI: He made sure I got my potato chips."
"RORY: Really, how confusing."
"LORELAI: I'll explain later. How are the grandparents?"
"RORY: Not speaking."
"LORELAI: Must have been one hell of a game."
"RORY: I read."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry I bailed."
"RORY: You owe me nothing but the gory details."
"LORELAI: I might like him."
"RORY: Just remember, you're sleeping with every single person he's ever slept with."
"LORELAI: Thank you for that."
"RORY: Call me tomorrow."
"LORELAI: You got it."
"[They hang up. As Rory starts to head back to her dorm, she sees Paris kissing Asher Fleming]"

"OPEN IN THE TOWN SQUARE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk.]"
"RORY: It's culs-de-sac."
"LORELAI: No way!"
"RORY: It is."
"LORELAI: The plural of cul-de-sac is culs-de-sac?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: That doesn't even sound like English."
"RORY: That's because it's French."
"LORELAI: You know what I mean."
"RORY: I hate to be the bearer of bad news."
"LORELAI: Words should sound right to be right."
"RORY: That's not how it works."
"LORELAI: So, what, the plural of yo-yo is yos-yo?"
"RORY: Yeah, 'cause that sounds so natural."
"LORELAI: As natural as culs-de-sac."
"[They walk into Luke's Diner, where Lane is waitressing.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, when did Lane start working here?"
"RORY: Oh, a couple of days ago. She filled out an application, and Luke brought her in for an interview and everything."
"LORELAI: An interview? So official."
"RORY: Yeah. They sat in complete silence for a full five minutes, then Luke said, ""How ya doing?"" and she said ""Good,"" and then he gave her the job."
"LORELAI: So what do we get out of this?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: We got someone on the inside now, a friend of ours."
"RORY: And out of it we could get?"
"LORELAI: The secret things he keeps back there."
"RORY: His showgirl costume."
"LORELAI: Extra jelly packets, butter, discarded day-old bread."
"RORY: But we get that when we go dumpster driving."
"LORELAI: This'll be easier on our shoes."
"[Luke walks over to their table]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Look at this."
"LORELAI: Who, Lane? She's super waitress, able to leap tall pancakes in a single bound. Or is that pans-cake?"
"RORY: Very funny."
"LUKE: It's not gonna work out."
"LORELAI: Oh. What, she's so good."
"LUKE: She's too good."
"LORELAI: Oh, calm down."
"LUKE: I'm not even sure why she took the job. I mean, I totally blew the interview."
"LORELAI: You were nervous."
"[Lane walks over]"
"LANE: Hey, guys. You got this, Luke?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I got it."
"LANE: [walking away] Caesar, I need that English muffin."
"LUKE: When there was a lull, she cleaned the menus without being asked."
"LORELAI: Do you mean mens-u?"
"RORY: Stop it."
"LUKE: This isn't challenging enough. She's gonna get bored."
"LORELAI: Buy her a chemistry set."
"RORY: Or a foosball table."
"LUKE: I should find something to do. [walks away]"
"RORY: Having help is stressing him."
"LORELAI: So, now, why do you have to get back to campus so early? Classes don't start for a couple of days."
"RORY: Yeah, I have a lot of stuff to do. And it'll be nice and quiet with no roommates around."
"LORELAI: Where are the rooms-mate?"
"RORY: Um, Janet's mountain climbing, Tanna's home, and Paris went skiing with her boyfriend."
"LORELAI: So you're just ignoring the plural thing now?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You haven't mentioned Paris' boyfriend in awhile. Everything good there?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: What? Something's not right?"
"RORY: Um, well, just the weirdness of them being really busy with school, and he's miles away at Princeton, but they're good. Um, she called me from the slopes and they sounded like they were having a blast."
"LANE: Eggs scrambled, Caesar. Hey, Luke, coffee in the corner."
"LUKE: Right, sorry."
"LORELAI: Boy, maybe this Lane/Luke team isn't gonna work out."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Where do you think Luke will go?"
"RORY: I don't know. Maybe a big chain will take him on."
"LORELAI: I wonder if he has a forklift license."
"RORY: He could redeem recyclables."
"LORELAI: You mean recycs-able?"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Michel are walking down the sidewalk]"
"MICHEL: You promise?"
"LORELAI: Yes. This is in and out, pick a molding for the public areas, meeting adjourned."
"MICHEL: No food sampling."
"LORELAI: It's not on the agenda."
"MICHEL: I have not seen Sookie once this month where she has not greeted me by shoving something in my mouth."
"LORELAI: Are you sure it was food every time?"
"MICHEL: You can joke, but as long as super low rise jeans are in fashion for men, I must stay trim or I'll die."
"[They walk up to Sookie's house and knock on the door]"
"SOOKIE: [calls from inside the house] Come on in!"
"LORELAI: How low we talking here?"
"MICHEL: I've had to wax."
"LORELAI: Subject over."
"[They walk into the house]"
"SOOKIE: Hi. Oh! [looks through the bag of crown molding Lorelai is carrying] Aha. Hm. Ooh, this is nice."
"LORELAI: That's my favorite, too. A little pricey."
"SOOKIE: It's amazing how we always pick the pricey. So, do you guys want something to -"
"MICHEL: No!"
"SOOKIE:. . .drink? I made hot water for tea."
"MICHEL: Tea?"
"SOOKIE: You like Earl Gray, right?"
"MICHEL: If you have some."
"SOOKIE: It's all ready. Earl Gray."
"MICHEL: Thank you."
"SOOKIE: And try this pizzelle."
"MICHEL: I knew it."
"LORELAI: Delight!"
"MICHEL: This is a tasting."
"SOOKIE: I just need your opinion."
"MICHEL: Well, my opinion is you're trying to fatten me out of a love life."
"SOOKIE: I thought you were celibate."
"MICHEL: Not by choice."
"[The baby starts crying in another room]"
"SOOKIE: You woke up Davey, big mouth."
"LORELAI: Do you wanna go check on him?"
"SOOKIE: He'll be out here in a second."
"LORELAI: He's two months and already walking? I'm missing the big moments."
"[Tobin walks into the room with the baby]"
"LORELAI: Tobin!"
"MICHEL: Tobin?"
"TOBIN: Hi, and I'm high around this little thing. He's such an angel."
"SOOKIE: Hello, little booby. Did that mean old Michel wake you up?"
"MICHEL: I'm being Punk'd. I know I'm being Punk'd."
"SOOKIE: Isn't this great? We have the whole team back together."
"MICHEL: I'm ecstatic. Did you know about this?"
"LORELAI: I knew that Tobin was back in town, but I didn't hear you were the -"
"TOBIN: Davey's nanny? Just until something permanent comes along."
"SOOKIE: Davey fell for this guy lock, stock and barrel. It was love at first sight."
"TOBIN: Well, my whole life is kids. I have eleven nieces and nephews."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"MICHEL: How joyous for you."
"LORELAI: Now, Tobin, we'd heard you moved."
"TOBIN: Yes, right after the inn b*rned down. I moved to Utah because I heard there was lots of job opportunities for industrious Mormons."
"LORELAI: I didn't know you were a Mormon."
"TOBIN: I wasn't, so I became one. The paperwork took weeks. And I didn't know about the alcohol thing."
"LORELAI: They famously abstain."
"TOBIN: No coffee either. The choir is fabulous, but then there's the funny underwear. It didn't last."
"SOOKIE: Then he called me from the road and suggested this."
"MICHEL: How wonderful."
"TOBIN: Oh, I see you're trying the pizzelles. Are they not pieces of heaven shaped like cookies?"
"LORELAI: Wonderful."
"TOBIN: You know, they'd be perfect for breakfast, too, with cappuccino."
"SOOKIE: I've never thought of them for breakfast. Great idea."
"MICHEL: It occurred to me."
"TOBIN: You know, you could serve them on that green platter we bought yesterday. The colors would juxtapose nicely."
"MICHEL: You went shopping together?"
"TOBIN: Yes. I turned Sookie onto a place that sells hard-to-find kitchenware. Oh, and I found some websites I'd like to recommend to you, Lorelai. I spent a lot of time online when I was a Mormon. There wasn't much else to do."
"MICHEL: Excuse me, is this not an inn meeting for inn employees only?"
"[The baby starts crying]"
"TOBIN: It's okay, little baby. I think your voice hits a pitch that hurts his ears."
"MICHEL: My voice has the same pitch as anyone else's."
"SOOKIE: Michel hates babies."
"MICHEL: I do not hate babies."
"LORELAI: Well, babies hate you."
"MICHEL: They do not hate me. Look, all I'm saying is, we have limited time together, the three of us, and we cannot afford to waste it, the three of us, and he's cutting in."
"TOBIN: Michel, I'm not cutting in. But the fact is, wherever Sookie goes, the baby goes, and wherever the baby goes, I go. It's my job. We even made a joke earlier - the baby has a meeting today. [points to a piece of crown molding] I love this."
"LORELAI: We do, too."
"SOOKIE: Would you like a cup of tea, Tobin?"
"TOBIN: Just a little lapsing oolong, please."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Richard and Emily are eating dinner]"
"LORELAI: You knew that?"
"RICHARD: Yes, I did."
"LORELAI: Come on!"
"RICHARD: Everyone does."
"LORELAI: Did you?"
"EMILY: Of course I did."
"LORELAI: So everyone in the entire world knew the plural of cul-de-sac was culs-de-sac?"
"RICHARD: Yes."
"LORELAI: Okay. So Mariah Carey is out with some friends and she's had a couple cocktails, she glances down from the roof and says, ""Oh, look at all those culs-de-sac."""
"RORY: Why are they on the roof?"
"LORELAI: It's a rooftop bar."
"RICHARD: How have you been saying it?"
"LORELAI: Cul-de-sacs."
"RICHARD: And no one ever corrected you?"
"LORELAI: No, because that's the way it should be. Even if it isn't technically correct, it should be pronounced that way."
"RORY: Mom, Mom, just let it go."
"LORELAI: I will never let this go."
"RORY: Is there dessert?"
"EMILY: Yes, and we have a special surprise for you for dessert. We brought it back from Switzerland."
"LORELAI: We're getting a mountain goat?"
"RICHARD: This is better than a goat."
"EMILY: Let's go into the living room."
"RORY: Dessert from Switzerland."
"LORELAI: The land of chocolate."
"RORY: Yum!"
"RICHARD: You two are going to love this."
"LORELAI: Is it as good as Toblerone?"
"RICHARD: Oh, it's better than Toblerone."
"[They walk to the living room. The maid sets the dessert tray on the coffee table]"
"LORELAI: Whoa, what is that?"
"EMILY: It's marzipan."
"RORY: Marzipan?"
"RICHARD: The finest marzipan in all of Europe. Made by cloistered nuns."
"EMILY: We toured their cloister, it was right out of ""The Sound of Music."""
"LORELAI: What happened to the chocolate?"
"EMILY: What chocolate?"
"LORELAI: You compared it to Toblerone - that's chocolate."
"RICHARD: You brought up Toblerone. I just said it was better than that because I think it is."
"EMILY: Marzipan is candy. You like candy."
"LORELAI: Marzipan is not candy. It is a unique substance unto itself, like Velveeta or plutonium."
"EMILY: You're not even going to try it?"
"LORELAI: I'll pass."
"RORY: I'll try some, Grandma."
"RICHARD: Take the one with the little pig on it."
"RORY: Oh, thank you."
"RICHARD: We got the pigs for you and the bunny for your mother."
"LORELAI: You got me bunnies?"
"EMILY: They're for whomever now."
"LORELAI: Well, no, I'll try a bunny."
"EMILY: Don't force yourself."
"LORELAI: I'm not. I want a bunny. Give me a bunny."
"EMILY: Delicious."
"RICHARD: Those nuns kick you-know-what."
"[the doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: Now who can that be?"
"RICHARD: Ah, it's probably Jason. He said he might drop something by on his way back from the airport."
"EMILY: In the middle of dinner?"
"RICHARD: He won't be here long. He's probably exhausted. The flight from Australia is draining."
"[The maid brings Jason to the living room]"
"RICHARD: Jason, welcome back."
"JASON: Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your evening."
"RICHARD: Oh, oh, not at all. You look fit. Look how fit he looks, Emily."
"EMILY: He looks very fit. Hello, Jason."
"JASON: Emily."
"RICHARD: Uh, you've met Lorelai and Rory."
"JASON: Yes, it's nice to see you again."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"RORY: Hi."
"JASON: Richard, here are the papers, and they do not need to be notarized."
"RICHARD: Oh, that's a huge help. Terrific."
"LORELAI: So, um, Mom, maybe our guest would, uh . . ."
"EMILY: Oh, Jason, would you like some marzipan?"
"JASON: Would I? I love marzipan."
"EMILY: Take as much as you like, and put some extra into a napkin. Just not the one Lorelai spat her piece into."
"JASON: [tries some marzipan] Mmm, delicious."
"RICHARD: Mmhmm, mmhmm."
"JASON: Well, I'll be going. It was good to see you all again."
"RICHARD: Oh, here."
"JASON: No, no, no, no, Richard, you don't have to see me out."
"RICHARD: All right. See you tomorrow."
"[Jason leaves]"
"RICHARD: He must have been hiking the whole time. He looks wonderful."
"LORELAI: Excuse me, I just have to freshen up my. . .be right back. [leaves the room]"
"EMILY: [to Rory] Have you swallowed your marzipan yet?"
"RORY: Mmhmm. [pause] Unh-uh. [Richard hands her a napkin and she spits out her marzipan]"
"[In another room, Lorelai calls Jason's cell phone.]"
"JASON: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Um, so, you're back."
"JASON: Uh, I am no hologram."
"LORELAI: Uh, Australia was good?"
"JASON: Very good. Hot."
"LORELAI: You tie your wallaby down, sport?"
"JASON: No, I just drank a lot of beer and thought about you a lot."
"LORELAI: That's very sweet."
"JASON: So when are we getting together again?"
"LORELAI: When do you want?"
"JASON: How about now?"
"LORELAI: Hm, too spontaneous."
"JASON: How about Monday night?"
"LORELAI: For what?"
"JASON: Dinner, et cetera."
"LORELAI: Sounds good, et cetera."
"JASON: I'll call you."
"LORELAI: Okay. Hey, what are you gonna do with your marzipan?"
"JASON: Oh, I don't know. I thought I'd dump 'em on the road, but is that environmentally sound?"
"LORELAI: I don't think marzipan biodegrades."
"JASON: I'll just serve it to the clients I don't like."
"LORELAI: Well, bye."
"JASON: I'll see you Monday."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is in the common room with a repairman who is fixing the radiator.]"
"REPAIRMAN: Almost done with your radiator, young lady."
"RORY: Take your time."
"REPAIRMAN: You were smart. You come back early, you b*at the rush."
"RORY: I just wanted to get a jump on things."
"REPAIRMAN: I like the campus when it's kind of empty like this, you know, all quiet. Snow's pretty, too."
"RORY: Yeah, very pretty."
"[Rory looks out the window and sees Paris with Asher Fleming]"
"REPAIRMAN: There's something very magical about this campus. I've been here 23 years come August and I've never been bored. You know, we've had presidents graduate from this school. You okay?"
"RORY: What?"
"REPAIRMAN: You feeling okay?"
"RORY: Yes. I, um. . .yes. Thanks."
"[Paris walks into the suite]"
"PARIS: Rory."
"RORY: Paris, hi. You're back early."
"PARIS: You're back early."
"RORY: Just thought I'd get a jump on things. How was your trip?"
"PARIS: Great. I thought I'd come back early."
"RORY: Same here. Where's your stuff?"
"PARIS: Well, I got back early."
"RORY: I know."
"PARIS: Early this morning, so I unpacked and then I went to visit my mom."
"RORY: Is she good?"
"PARIS: She wasn't there. Jamie says hello."
"RORY: Oh, good. Hello back at him. So, you guys have fun?"
"PARIS: I told you that on the phone."
"RORY: I know. You have fun after that?"
"PARIS: Sure. The resort was beautiful. A little too star-studded. Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart were there. They tongue kissed in public."
"RORY: They're in love."
"PARIS: Then she'd tickle his tummy and he'd giggle. It was foul."
"RORY: To each his own."
"PARIS: Well, I'll get out of your way."
"RORY: You're not in my way. I'll get out of your way."
"PARIS: You're not in my way."
"RORY: Well, I'll just stay here, then."
"PARIS: Good."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is in the kitchen eating from a pizza box at the counter. She closes the box and accidentally knocks it onto the floor]"
"LORELAI: End scene. sh**t."
"[She starts cleaning it up off the floor and brushes some crumbs underneath the sink. Rory arrives home and walks into the kitchen]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: [startled] Oh, God! Rory! Announce yourself!"
"RORY: Were you brushing dirt under the sink?"
"LORELAI: No, I am brushing crumbs under the sink."
"RORY: You're a pig."
"LORELAI: You're just learning that? Why are you here anyway?"
"RORY: Oh, crabby and dirty."
"LORELAI: Well, I thought you were going to hang at school for some alone time."
"RORY: Alone time suddenly included Paris."
"LORELAI: Oh. I thought Paris was skiing with Jamie."
"RORY: Paris is definitely not skiing, and Paris is definitely not with Jamie."
"LORELAI: Hm, meaning?"
"RORY: [looking under the sink] There are little marshmallow Easter bunnies under here."
"LORELAI: No, no, what did you mean when you said Paris was not with Jamie?"
"RORY: Paris is seeing somebody else."
"LORELAI: Really? A psychiatrist?"
"RORY: A professor."
"LORELAI: At Yale?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh, wow. Lorelai Gilmore, you've been holding out on me."
"RORY: It's so weird. One minute, she's totally in love with Jamie and then the next, she's making out with a professor in a dark corner."
"LORELAI: You saw them making out?"
"RORY: Apparently, the big game was big for everyone."
"LORELAI: Well, wow. I can't believe Paris is doing an older man."
"RORY: Who said doing? I didn't say doing. I just said kissing, that's it."
"LORELAI: Rory, come on. When you're dating an older man, you're probably doing older-man things."
"RORY: Oh, geez."
"LORELAI: So what age are we talking here, like 35, 40? 45? 46? 47? 47½? 48?"
"RORY: Sixty!"
"LORELAI: What?! Shut up!"
"RORY: He went to school with Grandpa."
"LORELAI: Sixty?"
"RORY: That's how they met. We were having lunch, he came by, Grandpa introduced them. She wanted to get an interview, and apparently, she got one."
"LORELAI: Sixty? Like sixty-sixty?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, it's just. . .now I know who Woody Allen's next leading lady's gonna be."
"RORY: And it's so annoying. I mean, she's hiding it from me, so I'm not supposed to know. I'm supposed to think that she's still with Jamie, which she's not."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Intrigue."
"RORY: I don't like intrigue, I don't want intrigue. I like Jamie. He's a nice guy. He's a patient guy. I mean, Paris should not be treating him like this."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, if she likes another guy, there's nothing you can do about it. Let us all remember Dean."
"RORY: This is not the same as Dean. I did not cheat on Dean with an old guy."
"LORELAI: Is the old guy married?"
"RORY: He was. He has kids, grown kids. He's a writer."
"LORELAI: Well, what would the school say if they knew about this?"
"RORY: Yes, what about that? This guy's risking everything - his job, his reputation."
"LORELAI: Yes, well. . .he'll always have Paris."
"RORY: How long have you been waiting with that one?"
"LORELAI: I just had a feeling the opportunity would present itself eventually."
"RORY: Maybe it's a phase. It'll pass."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, or he will."
"[The phone rings and Lorelai answers]"
"LORELAI: Hello? What? Michel? Calm down. I can't understand you when you're not screaming hysterically. Well, okay, well, what are you. . .okay! Okay, I'll be right there. Goodbye. [hangs up] I gotta go."
"RORY: Why? What's up?"
"LORELAI: Michel's spazzing."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Will you be here when I get back?"
"RORY: If you don't mind. Paris was getting out her potter's wheel as I was leaving."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll go pick up Chinese."
"RORY: Or we can just eat what's under the sink."
"LORELAI: Ah, the wit."
"RORY: Get egg rolls."
"LORELAI: All right, just watch out - old guys don't like 'em bossy."
"RORY: Yeah, yeah."
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks up to Sookie's house, where Michel is waiting out front]"
"MICHEL: You took so long! Why? You need to charter an airplane?"
"LORELAI: I came as quickly as I - ow!"
"MICHEL: Get in here."
"LORELAI: What is going on?"
"MICHEL: Move quicker, please."
"[Michel leads Lorelai into the house]"
"LORELAI: Is Sookie here?"
"MICHEL: She and the farmer went to see a movie."
"LORELAI: Do they know you're here?"
"MICHEL: Yes, they do."
"LORELAI: And they're okay with that?"
"MICHEL: This way, please."
"[Michel pulls Lorelai into a bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Stop. What's going on? Why are we in the bedroom?"
"MICHEL: I offered to babysit."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, you did what?"
"MICHEL: I heard Sookie talking to the potato man about wanting to go out, and there was no one to watch the baby, so I offered to watch it for her."
"LORELAI: It?"
"MICHEL: Him. Watch him for her."
"LORELAI: And she let you?"
"MICHEL: Yes, she let me. So I came over, and the minute that she left, it started to cry."
"LORELAI: It?"
"MICHEL: Him, he started to cry. He wouldn't stop. I did everything. I did the jiggle and the bouncy and the airplane, and then I even picked it up."
"LORELAI: It?"
"MICHEL: Him, dammit, him! I picked him up, but it didn't matter. He wouldn't stop crying. So finally I invented a game."
"LORELAI: What kind of game?"
"MICHEL: I called it baby crepe."
"LORELAI: I don't think I know that one."
"MICHEL: Well, it's quite ingenious. You get down here on the floor and then you roll him up in a blanket and then you pull it back and forth and back and forth. He loved it. He did not cry, he smiled, he giggled. He was having the time of his life. And then. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh no."
"MICHEL: I pulled back the blanket a little too hard."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MICHEL: And he rolled under the bed."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MICHEL: And he got stuck."
"LORELAI: Oh! Oh my God!"
"MICHEL: I tried to get him out, but I couldn't get him to grab the string, and then he fell asleep, and I worried if I woke him up, the screaming would start again."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you rolled little Davey under the bed."
"MICHEL: Davey?"
"LORELAI: Yes, Davey - Sookie's baby."
"MICHEL: Is that his name? I've been calling him Truman."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"MICHEL: I thought that's what his name was."
"LORELAI: Where'd you get Truman from?"
"MICHEL: I don't know, I heard it wrong, okay? Do you think he's gonna hold this against me?"
"LORELAI: What, the man that rolled him under the bed? No, I think you're good. Oh, man, he really is sleeping. He looks so peaceful."
"MICHEL: See? I made him happy."
"LORELAI: We need to lift this bed and get him up."
"[Michel starts to unbutton his shirt]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"MICHEL: Taking off my shirt."
"LORELAI: Uh, what part of ""lift the bed and get him out"" translates to you taking off your shirt?"
"MICHEL: This is an expensive shirt."
"LORELAI: No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not lifting the bed with a naked you."
"MICHEL: I wasn't going to take off my pants."
"LORELAI: Leave the shirt on."
"MICHEL: It will wrinkle."
"LORELAI: Not as much as it will if Sookie comes home and finds Truman under the bed. Now, uh, lift up here, and I'll get him out."
"MICHEL: I can't hold this by myself. Are you crazy?"
"LORELAI: Okay, you hold that. Are you ready?"
"MICHEL: No!"
"[Michel holds up the bed while Lorelai picks up Davey off the floor]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Hey, Davey. I gotcha. You're snoozy, huh? Yeah."
"MICHEL: How is he?"
"LORELAI: He's just fine. He's just fine. There you go. Just kick back, wait 'til Mommy gets home. [Lorelai puts Davey in his bassinet] Now please tell me what is going on here."
"MICHEL: Nothing."
"LORELAI: Why are you babysitting?"
"MICHEL: I -"
"LORELAI: You hate babies."
"MICHEL: Not really."
"LORELAI: You do not babysit ever. And yet here you are wearing your super-low-cut jeans making up baby games, and I want to know why."
"MICHEL: I hate Tobin! He's a sniveling little sycophantic tushie kisser, and I hate him!"
"LORELAI: Michel!"
"MICHEL: He weasels his way into every area of my life. The only good thing about the Independence Inn burning down was that Tobin was gone, but yet, here he is, back. He's like the cat."
"LORELAI: What cat?"
"MICHEL: The one that came back the very next day. You thought he was a goner, but the cat came back. He just wouldn't stay away."
"LORELAI: Michel, you do not have to be jealous of Tobin."
"MICHEL: He wants to replace me."
"LORELAI: As what?"
"MICHEL: As everything. He wants to replace me in my entire life. He's going to keep worming his way in until you no longer find any reason to have me around."
"LORELAI: You're being silly."
"MICHEL: He's going to succeed. It doesn't matter that I have all the experience and the credentials and the history to run this inn. He likes the baby. He holds the baby. He doesn't roll the baby under the bed - he wins!"
"LORELAI: Oh, he does not win. Michel, this rivalry is in your head."
"MICHEL: It is, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"MICHEL: So you do not like Tobin better than me?"
"LORELAI: No. We like Tobin. We're addicted to you."
"MICHEL: You are?"
"LORELAI: Yes. We asked you to come with us to the Dragonfly, didn't we? We love you, Michel, and as long as you stay far, far away from little Davey, we will continue loving you."
"MICHEL: Oh. I can do that."
"LORELAI: Good."
"CUT TO YALE"
"[Rory and Paris are in the newspaper office making newspaper hats]"
"RORY: Okay, hold on. And. . .what do you think?"
"PARIS: It stinks."
"RORY: Well, it's a newspaper hat. It's not supposed to spark a trend."
"PARIS: There."
"RORY: How'd you do that?"
"PARIS: Martha Stewart."
"RORY: Martha Stewart actually did a segment on how to make a hat out of newspaper?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"RORY: Oh. Well, it looks nice."
"GLENN: Aah! What is this? Academically approved torture? Make your own hat - that's how you get on the paper? 'Cause that has what to do with anything?"
"RORY: Relax, Glenn."
"PARIS: It's tradition."
"GLENN: It's not tradition. It's hazing. Why don't they just handcuff us naked to a streetlamp wearing a sign that says, ""honk if you like unbiased journalism""? I'm not doing it. They can't make me."
"DOYLE: You don't wear the hat, you're not getting on the paper."
"GLENN: I need another sheet."
"DOYLE: Ladies and gentlemen, tonight represents a melding of the old and the new. For one night, identifying the two groups will be easy. The old will be the ones running around frantically trying to get out the latest issue of the Daily News, and the new will be the ones in the stupid hats. It's a much-beloved tradition that for one night, all night, you don a hat of your own making, wait on members of the paper while observing the inner working of the Yale Daily News. There's a lot of new, fresh talent sitting in this room tonight. Rory Gilmore, an unflinchingly honest reviewer who shows no mercy, but a great deal of dark wit in her pieces. Paris Geller, whose interview with Professor Asher Fleming was the most intimate and revealing portrait of a complicated man that I have ever read. Glenn Babble, whose cartoon commentaries on the American family prove that he was never hugged a day in his life. It's hard work being here, but it's an honor. You're working with the best of the best. From here, you can go t"
"PARIS: You know, you never told me what you thought of my article."
"RORY: Um, what article?"
"PARIS: My interview with Asher Fleming. Did you read it?"
"RORY: I skimmed it."
"PARIS: Oh, well, I have a copy in our room. I can give it to you tomorrow."
"RORY: You're a good writer. I'm sure it's good."
"PARIS: Yeah, but still, I'd like you to read it. I trust your opinion, and I'd like to be able to discuss it with you."
"RORY: Look, we're supposed to be taking dinner orders, so. . ."
"[Paris' cell phone rings, and she answers]"
"PARIS: Hello? Hi."
"DOYLE: [from across the room] No phone calls while you're wearing the hat!"
"PARIS: Hold on. [to Rory] I will be right back."
"RORY: Where are you going? You're not supposed to leave while you're wearing the hat."
"PARIS: I will be right back. [grabs her coat and sneaks out]"
"GLENN: It's a good thing high school had already b*at all the self-esteem out of me."

"CUT TO JASON'S APARTMENT"
"[Lorelai and Jason walk in]"
"JASON: How could you talk through an entire movie?"
"LORELAI: Well, nothing else was happening."
"JASON: An entire movie was happening. There were people in costumes and horses. Did you see the horses?"
"LORELAI: I did see the horses."
"JASON: I thought you liked horses."
"LORELAI: I do like horses, but they never let them talk."
"JASON: Well, that's because this wasn't a talking-horse movie. You want some wine?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. You're vibing my movie-watching habits."
"JASON: I am not vibing your habits. I'm merely saying that the large man in a wife b*at sitting in front of us invited me into the lobby to discuss your habits, and had I accepted his charming invitation, I might be in traction right now."
"LORELAI: Oh, please. You could totally have outrun him. You're spry. [Jason hands her a glass of wine] Thank you. So, this is your place."
"JASON: This is it."
"LORELAI: Hm. Interesting. Very, very interesting."
"JASON: So, what's the verdict?"
"LORELAI: Well, you're not a tchotchke guy."
"JASON: Yeah, I don't like too many objects around that have no obvious purpose."
"LORELAI: The purpose of tchotchkes is to make you happy. They make you smile. They make a room seem fun and whimsical."
"JASON: Well, I invite a clown over once a week to make the room feel fun and whimsical, so I feel all set in that department."
"LORELAI: I thought you said you had a dog."
"JASON: I do."
"LORELAI: Where is he?"
"JASON: Over there. [he points to a dog sitting perfectly still in front of the fireplace]"
"LORELAI: Oh. He's cute. . .and very still."
"JASON: Yeah, he's the best."
"LORELAI: What is his name?"
"JASON: Cyrus."
"LORELAI: Cyrus, sure. Perfect name for a dog. Cyrus. Hi, Cyrus. Is he breathing?"
"JASON: Yes. Cyrus was actually trained by the monks of New Skete."
"LORELAI: Oh, wow."
"JASON: He's incredibly well-behaved. He was housebroken in an hour. He has a two-bark minimum for delivery guys, three for everybody else, but the best thing about him is he doesn't do any of the standard ""sit and lie down"" commands. I taught him very special commands that only my dog could know."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"JASON: Uh, like. . .a little to the left."
"LORELAI: Shut up."
"JASON: Cyrus, a little to the left."
"[Cyrus moves to the left]"
"LORELAI: What the hell's that good for?"
"JASON: Well, what the hell is ""sit"" good for?"
"LORELAI: When you sit, you get a cookie."
"JASON: Well, when you move a little to the left, you get the satisfaction of knowing you are doing something, but you are not pandering for a dog bone."
"LORELAI: Can he move a little to the right?"
"JASON: No, not yet. We just do a little to the left until he hits the wall, and then I turn him around."
"LORELAI: You and your dog are extremely weird."
"JASON: Thank you. [they kiss]"
"LORELAI: Thank you. [they kiss again] I'm not sure we're setting such a good example for Cyrus over there."
"JASON: Oh, you might be right. Cyrus. . . [gestures for Cyrus to turn around, which he does]"
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, that one, I get. [they kiss again]"
"CUT TO YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE"
"[Doyle is reviewing a student's article]"
"DOYLE: Every week, you argue with me."
"STUDENT: But Doyle, it's a perfectly good article."
"DOYLE: Hey, we don't do ""perfectly good"" here. You want to do ""perfectly good,"" go to Harvard."
"STUDENT: Jackass."
"[The student walks away and passes Rory, who is carrying a container of ice cream]"
"STUDENT: Can you b*at him to death with that?"
"RORY: I don't think so. It's soft serve. [she walks over to Doyle] I got your ice cream."
"DOYLE: What is this?"
"RORY: Strawberry ice cream."
"DOYLE: It has strawberries in it."
"RORY: I don't even know how to respond to that."
"DOYLE: I wanted plain strawberry ice cream without chunks of strawberries in it. This has chunks."
"RORY: I see one."
"DOYLE: I can't eat this. Take it away."
"RORY: Would you like me to get you something else?"
"DOYLE: No, just forget it. Fine. Bring it back."
"RORY: Are you okay, Doyle?"
"DOYLE: Yes. Why wouldn't I be?"
"RORY: I don't know. You just seem a little bit annoyed tonight."
"DOYLE: Well, I have an issue to put out with a big hole on the back page because my editorial writers chose to be unopinionated today!"
"RORY: And that's it?"
"DOYLE: And I got rejected for a job as Yale's stringer to Time magazine."
"RORY: Ah, so, that explains it."
"DOYLE: This is a major blow to my career, you know."
"RORY: You're twenty."
"DOYLE: These things can follow you, Rory. One day you're feeling good, you're the fair-haired boy, and the next day you're Schleprock."
"RORY: You're not Schleprock, Doyle."
"DOYLE: Tell that to my dad."
"GLENN: Okay, I just have to say how amazingly unfair it is that I have a rubber band working its way into my brain, and Paris gets to bail."
"RORY: Paris isn't here?"
"GLENN: No, she isn't."
"DOYLE: You didn't know she left?"
"RORY: No, I knew that there was this thing with her family, um, that she was really concerned about. Well, you know she got that call, and her aunt is sick, and I heard her say something about going to the hospital so I think that's where she went."
"DOYLE: All right. Well, come get me the minute she gets back."
"RORY: I will."
"CUT TO JASON'S APARTMENT"
"[Lorelai is lying in Jason's bed. Jason walks in with two glasses of water]"
"LORELAI: Hey, do you have a Cosmo lying around? 'Cause I wanna see how many calories I just b*rned off."
"JASON: I've looked. It's 55."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, it's way more than 55. I know what 55 is, and that, my friend, was not 55. [he hands her a glass of water] Thanks."
"JASON: Are you cold? I could turn up the heat."
"LORELAI: Oh, please, enough with the bragging."
"JASON: So, you're good?"
"LORELAI: I'm good. I'm gonna fall asleep extremely happy tonight. Hi."
"JASON: Hi back."
"LORELAI: Are you thinking about joining me back here anytime soon?"
"JASON: Joining you. . .well. . ."
"LORELAI: Jason?"
"JASON: Okay, just remember, you like that I have little quirks."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"JASON: They're what make me me."
"LORELAI: You're not gonna ask to wear my dress, are you?"
"JASON: No. Um, I was just wondering if you wouldn't mind sleeping in the guest room tonight."
"LORELAI: Well. . .didn't see that one coming."
"JASON: I am the world's lightest sleeper. I have chronic insomnia, so I just, I toss and I turn like a crazy person, and I can't sleep in the same bed with another person."
"LORELAI: You're serious?"
"JASON: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You want me to go in the guest room?"
"JASON: It's a really nice room."
"LORELAI: You know, why don't I just go?"
"JASON: Oh, no, no, no, please, I swear, I want you to stay. I want to see you in the morning. I wanna make you breakfast. I want you to be here when I get up. Well, not here. . . in there, but -"
"LORELAI: You know, Jason, you don't have to go to all this trouble just to get me to leave."
"JASON: I don't want you to leave."
"LORELAI: I'm a big girl, I can handle the truth."
"JASON: This is the truth."
"LORELAI: It's fine, I have things I need to do tomorrow. I should probably go home anyhow."
"JASON: Please, just look at the room. Just one look. A peek. You don't even have to use both eyes if you don't want to."
"LORELAI: One look."
"JASON: That's all I ask. Well, that, and you get out of the bed very slowly."
"LORELAI: You know what, don't flirt with me. I'm finding you weird right now."
"JASON: Fair enough. Here you go. [hands her a robe]"
"[they walk to the guest bedroom]"
"JASON: Here it is."
"LORELAI: It's okay."
"JASON: There are hundreds of great books in here, ranging from the classics - ""Wuthering Heights"" - to the real classics - ""Valley of the Dolls."""
"LORELAI: Nice taste."
"JASON: Fully loaded minibar - soda, candy, little bottles of hooch. A really great CD player, CD's down below, and a DVD library above."
"LORELAI: DVD's but no TV?"
"JASON: Aha."
"[Jason presses a button on a remote control, and a plasma television rises up from the foot of the bed]"
"JASON: Oh, come on, that is cool."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine, it's cool. The room is good."
"JASON: It's better than good. I would love this room."
"LORELAI: Well, you do know you can have it, don't you?"
"JASON: I can't have any distractions in my room or I won't sleep."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"JASON: That's right. TV, reading material, unbelievably gorgeous woman."
"LORELAI: I should at least get billing over the TV."
"JASON: It's plasma."
"LORELAI: Oh, right."
"JASON: So, what do you think?"
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"JASON: There's Kiehl's products in the bathroom."
"LORELAI: Jason, I promise, if I leave, it won't be that big a deal."
"JASON: It'll be a very big deal to me. Please. Stay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"JASON: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Freak."
"JASON: Thank you. Even for the ""freak,"" thank you. Uh, there's a loofah in the top drawer. Good night."
"LORELAI: Good night."
"[Lorelai climbs into the guest bed and turns on the television]"
"CUT TO YALE"
"[In the middle of the night, Rory is awakened by the sound of the suite door opening. She checks the clock and tries to go back to sleep. Paris walks into the room and purposely makes noise to try to wake Rory up.]"
"PARIS: Whew. It's late. Late, late, late, late, late, late, late. Don't you wanna know where I was?"
"RORY: No, I don't."
"PARIS: I completely lost track of time. I guess I should remember to take a watch with me from now on. Man, when I got that call tonight, I had no idea it was gonna go this late. Yes, it was quite a night. Tonight. You're sure you don't wanna know where I was?"
"RORY: No, I don't wanna know where you were, and I don't wanna know what you were doing or who you were doing it with. I had to cover for you when Doyle noticed that you were gone, so I told him that you were at a family thing, and as far as I'm concerned, that's where you were - at your family thing. And in the future, I want nothing to do with anything to do with what you were doing tonight or who you were doing it with, especially who! Now, go to sleep."
"PARIS: I smell like pipe tobacco."
"RORY: Oh, jeez."
"CUT TO JASON'S APARTMENT"
"[The next morning, Jason is cooking breakfast when Lorelai walks down the steps]"
"LORELAI: Hi, Cyrus."
"JASON: Oh, good. Listen, would you still find me attractive if I were poor?"
"LORELAI: Um, no."
"JASON: Ah, that's what I figured. Sleep good?"
"LORELAI: I watched ""The Daily Show,"" fell into the best sleep I ever had, woke up, watched ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" and had a vanilla-scented jacuzzi bath."
"JASON: Ah, so that's what the look on your face is. I thought it was from sex with me."
"LORELAI: No, it's from the jacuzzi bath. Good morning."
"JASON: Good morning. Uh, coffee's over here."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Mm, the coffee smells good. Hey, can we, uh, not sleep together again tonight?"
"JASON: Absolutely. You want cheese in your eggs?"
"LORELAI: Why not? [sips her coffee] Mm, good."
"JASON: I think we're ready to go."
"[they walk to the table and sit down]"
"LORELAI: Wow, look what you've done here."
"JASON: Well, I am trying to impress you. Trust me, once you're completely mad about me, it is back to corn flakes and beer."
"LORELAI: This is lovely."
"JASON: You are lovely."
"LORELAI: [tastes the food] Very good."
"JASON: Tomorrow I'll make blintzes."
"LORELAI: Um, listen, we should talk about what we're gonna do."
"JASON: About what?"
"LORELAI: I mean, you know, what we're gonna, uh, say to people about us."
"JASON: Hm, how about ""yahoo""?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm talking about what we're gonna say to my parents about us."
"JASON: Oh, well, I thought we'd say that we're having repeated sexual encounters out of wedlock continuously as catholic schoolchildren are walking by."
"LORELAI: Perfect."
"JASON: No, you know. . .we like each other, we're dating - pretty simple."
"LORELAI: Nothing is simple when it comes to my parents."
"JASON: Okay, what do you want to say?"
"LORELAI: I'd like to say nothing."
"JASON: Nothing?"
"LORELAI: I mean, it isn't really any of their business anyhow, is it?"
"JASON: Uh, no, but we can't just say nothing."
"LORELAI: It'll cause too many problems if they know."
"JASON: In my experience, these things have a way of coming out."
"LORELAI: How?"
"JASON: I don't know. Somebody slips up."
"LORELAI: I never slip up. I'm completely non-slip. I'm like one of those rubber mats you stick in the bottom of the tub."
"JASON: Why can't we tell your parents about this?"
"LORELAI: I just think it's weird. You're in business with my father and he won't like this."
"JASON: He'll get used to it."
"LORELAI: My father has never gotten used to anything. He still misses diesel fuel, for God's sake."
"JASON: You don't find it exhausting, keeping secrets? You have to watch everything you say."
"LORELAI: I always have to watch everything that I say around my parents anyway."
"JASON: Okay, how about we just tell one of them, just to see how that goes?"
"LORELAI: Please, Jason. We will tell them eventually, I promise, just not now."
"JASON: Okay. They're your parents, and if you feel that strongly, then we'll wait."
"LORELAI: Thank you. [picks up a piece of bacon] Hey, um, can I feed this to Cyrus?"
"JASON: Sure. [calls to the dog] Hey, Cyrus, you want the bacon?"
"[Cyrus doesn't move]"
"LORELAI: That is one strange dog, Jason."
"JASON: Yup."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai walks up to the front door and rings the doorbell. Suddenly several people walk up behind her]"
"MAN: Excuse me. Do you know how much longer it's going on?"
"LORELAI: [confused] Uh. . .no. . .uh. . ."
"[A woman answers the door]"
"DORRIE: Well, hello."
"MAN: Are we too late?"
"DORRIE: No, of course not."
"MAN: Good."
"DORRIE: May I have your ticket, please?"
"LORELAI: I don't have a ticket."
"DORRIE: Well, you can't take the tour without a ticket."
"[Emily walks over]"
"EMILY: Excuse me, Dorrie, this is my daughter."
"DORRIE: Oh! Well, hello there."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"EMILY: Come in, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay. [to the people behind her] Bye. [walks into the house] Mom, what is going on?"
"EMILY: We let the Historical Society use our house for a walking tour. It's for a good cause, and I am never doing it again."
"[They walk to the dining room, where Richard and Rory are sitting at the table]"
"RICHARD: It was supposed to end at five o'clock, Emily."
"EMILY: I know that, Richard. What do you want me to do, throw them out?"
"RICHARD: This is not how it's done. This is not how proper charities work. You do not infringe on people's lives. You make a plan and stick to it."
"[The tour group walks past the dining room]"
"TOURIST: Oh, look. They hired actors to be the family. How clever."
"RICHARD: We are not actors!"
"EMILY: Richard, please."
"DORRIE: Oh no, folks, this is not part of the tour. Sorry, Emily. [ushers the tour group away]"
"EMILY: That's quite all right, Dorrie."
"RICHARD: It is not all right, Dorrie."
"EMILY: Richard, just ignore it and pass the carrots."
"RICHARD: This is lunacy. I feel as if I was in a zoo."
"LORELAI: Well, Dad, you know what monkeys do when they don't like people staring at them in the zoo."
"RICHARD: No, I don't."
"EMILY: And you don't want to."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"EMILY: I can just tell."
"[Someone starts playing the piano in another room]"
"RICHARD: Don't play that piano! Don't you see the sign? There was supposed to be a sign."
"EMILY: There is a sign."
"RICHARD: Well, it's not a very good sign."
"DORRIE: [from another room] The house was built in 1906 by Stanford White."
"RICHARD: That's it. [leaves the room] The house was built in 1907, and he was a protégé of Stanford White."
"EMILY: I'm getting a migraine. [follows after Richard]"
"LORELAI: So, you're a full-fledged newspaper-woman now."
"RORY: Yes, I am."
"LORELAI: Congratulations."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Now you gotta get yourself a nickname like Smitty and start talking really fast."
"RORY: Faster than I already do?"
"LORELAI: Hey, whatever it takes."
"[Emily and Richard return to the dining room]"
"EMILY: What where you going to do, hit the man?"
"RICHARD: He went into my desk!"
"EMILY: He was 85 years old."
"RICHARD: Well, it's never too late to learn a lesson. This is it, Emily. I mean it."
"EMILY: I know you do, Richard."
"RICHARD: The next time you plan a function, we will rent a hall and do it properly, like the fibromyalgia function last night. That is the proper way to raise money."
"LORELAI: You went to a function last night, you had a function tonight. . ."
"EMILY: We didn't host the one last night. We were just guests."
"RORY: Was it fun?"
"EMILY: It was fine."
"RICHARD: It wasn't here. It was perfect."
"EMILY: The food was terrible. The fact that people still insist on serving paella is simply beyond me. However, the room looked lovely."
"RICHARD: And the music was excellent."
"EMILY: And the guest list was very good - a lovely group of people, except for. . ."
"RICHARD: Emily!"
"EMILY: Would it have hurt the woman to buy an undergarment?"
"LORELAI: [gasps] Who?"
"RICHARD: She was a very nice girl. I wouldn't request to see her thesis on anything, but she was charming and a good dancer."
"LORELAI: Who's the dumb girl without the underwear?"
"EMILY: Jason's date."
"LORELAI: Jason brought a date?"
"EMILY: And I had to sit next to her all night. Oh, the fascinating time we had. I know all the best places to get my acrylics filled."
"RICHARD: Your mother is a snob. She was quite beautiful."
"LORELAI: She was, huh?"
"EMILY: Well, she's perfect for Jason, I will say that."
"LORELAI: So, how beautiful was she? Are we talking Catherine Zeta-Jones or the weird-looking Hilton sister?"
"EMILY: She looks like exactly the kind of gold digger who would latch onto an immature little con artist like Jason."
"RICHARD: My goodness, Emily, tell us how you really feel about the boy."
"LORELAI: But when you say gold digger, do you mean she was cheap-looking?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"RICHARD: No."
"LORELAI: So is he serious about this girl?"
"EMILY: Oh, who can tell? She looks like a perfectly fine first wife for him."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"[Someone plays the piano in another room]"
"RICHARD: Now the old man is just baiting me. [storms off] What did I tell you about the piano?"
"CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Lorelai, Sookie, and Michel walk through the inn, which is still under construction]"
"LORELAI: You know, we don't have to put the reception area over there."
"MICHEL: I just want to know where my office is going to be."
"LORELAI: Fonzie used the bathroom as his office."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, what are you saying, that what's good enough for the Fonz isn't good enough for you?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"MICHEL: Fonzie used that bathroom office only intermittently and not for any business for which he was paid. He had use of a private office at the auto shop he worked at, then access to the teachers' lounge where he taught night school part time."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, you're taking this Fonzie thing way too seriously."
"[Jason walks in]"
"JASON: Lorelai, am I interrupting?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, what are you doing here?"
"JASON: Uh, I was on my way to New York, and I wanted to see this inn you're always talking about."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, uh, sure."
"SOOKIE: Hello, I'm Sookie."
"LORELAI: Um, Sookie's my partner here."
"JASON: Hi, Sookie, I'm Jason Stiles."
"SOOKIE: Yes, you are."
"MICHEL: Uh, Michel Gerard."
"LORELAI: And Michel is the manager of the Dragonfly."
"JASON: It's nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, um, I'm just gonna show Jason around."
"MICHEL: Take your time."
"LORELAI: Follow me."
"[Lorelai and Jason walk out to the front yard]"
"JASON: Your friends seem really nice."
"LORELAI: Oh, they're the best."
"JASON: So, who do they think I am?"
"LORELAI: What do you mean?"
"JASON: Well, did you tell 'em we're dating or do they think I make your hats?"
"LORELAI: They know who you are."
"JASON: This place is really great."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you think?"
"JASON: I do."
"LORELAI: Good, that's good."
"JASON: Um, you seem a little distracted. Did I come at a bad time?"
"LORELAI: No, you came at a perfect time."
"JASON: Perfect time for. . ."
"LORELAI: I heard you went to a function the other night."
"JASON: Ah, fibromyalgia - a very dull disease."
"LORELAI: I also heard you didn't go alone."
"JASON: No, I didn't."
"LORELAI: So, you brought a date?"
"JASON: Yes, I did."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. Well, that's good, I'm glad. Um, my mother said she didn't wear any underwear."
"JASON: Emily didn't wear any underwear?"
"LORELAI: Your date didn't wear any underwear."
"JASON: Oh, I don't know that for a fact, but if Emily said so, far be it from me to call her a liar."
"LORELAI: Huh, okay. Hey, you wanna see the stables?"
"JASON: Uh, sure."
"LORELAI: Well, there they are. Well, tour's over. Bathroom's to the left."
"JASON: You wanna tell me what you're bothered about?"
"LORELAI: We're sleeping together, and you're taking bare-butted women to functions?"
"JASON: Crystal is just a friend -"
"LORELAI: A friend named Crystal? Who are you, Hugh Hefner?"
"JASON: Whoa, whoa, wait a sec. I would have much rather taken you to that function. Trust me, Crystal is very sweet, but the mocking of the sick is completely beyond her capabilities. But you told me in no uncertain terms that your parents were not supposed to know about us, and since this is a function your parents would be attending, I thought taking you would be out of the question."
"LORELAI: Well, you could've gone alone."
"JASON: You don't go to these things alone. There are two seats and you're expected to fill them."
"LORELAI: Well, you could've told me so I wasn't blindsided by my parents."
"JASON: See, this is what I mean about keeping secrets. It never works. Let's just tell your parents, then we never have to have this conversation again. Lorelai, I am in a business where there are lots of functions. I have to go to those functions, and I don't want to take other people, but I'm gonna have to if you won't let me say something to your father. I have no interest in spending a second of my time with any other woman but you. And Eartha Kitt."
"LORELAI: Well, sure."
"JASON: So, what do you say? Can we end the madness and tell your parents?"
"LORELAI: No."
"JASON: No?"
"LORELAI: I know it's tricky to keep this a secret, but I just don't think it's time to tell them yet. And if that means that I have to adjust, then I have to adjust. And now that you've told me how you feel, I think it's fine if you take Crystal to these functions."
"JASON: Well, it's fine for you - you don't have to talk to the woman."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry."
"JASON: Hey, maybe you don't understand. It's like b*at your head against a wall with spikes."
"LORELAI: [laughs] Wanna see the apple trees?"
"JASON: She thinks that Babe can really talk."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"CUT TO YALE"
"[Rory is in a classroom waiting for class to start. A student rushes in and sits down next to her]"
"STUDENT: Contemporary Political Fiction?"
"RORY: Yes."
"STUDENT: Oh, good. I swore this semester would be different. I would get to class on time. I would finish my assignments on time. I would do everything on time. [gasps] I left my purse on the bench."
"[The student jumps up and rushes toward the door, bumping into Professor Fleming as he enters the room]"
"PROFESSOR FLEMING: I haven't started speaking yet."
"RORY: [to another student] Asher Fleming is teaching this course?"
"STUDENT: I know. Isn't it cool?"
"[Professor Fleming recognizes Rory and walks over to her]"
"PROFESSOR FLEMING: Ah, Rory Gilmore. We meet again."
"RORY: Hello, Professor Fleming."
"PROFESSOR FLEMING: You're taking this class?"
"RORY: Yes, I am."
"PROFESSOR FLEMING: Wonderful. I look forward to it. After all, it seems very natural, doesn't it? Especially since you and I have someone very important in common, hm? Your grandfather. Good man."
"RORY: Yes, sir. Very good."
"PROFESSOR FLEMING: All right, well, let's get settled. The class is Contemporary Political Fiction. I am Professor Fleming. All those in the wrong class, please leave. How do you know you're in the wrong class? If you do not enjoy a good argument, if you find it difficult to voice a differing opinion, and if you cannot appreciate an intelligently cloaked insult, then you're in the wrong class. If all of these things appeal to you, then you are in for an interesting semester. I'll be handing out the reading lists."

"[Miss Patty sings solemnly to the town sitting in pews]"
"RORY: [Sniffles]"
"LORELAI: Kleenex. [Hands her a Kleenex.]"
"RORY: I'm gonna miss Stan."
"LORELAI: I know, I'm gonna miss him too."
"RORY: He was so cute, with his fedora and his Hush Puppies. Everyday, the fedora and the Hush Puppies."
"LORELAI: Yeah, if he just would have added some pants."
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I'm just trying to lighten the mood."
"RORY: 'Cause you wouldn't want a downer funeral."
"LORELAI: Ok, we're being serious now."
"SOOKIE: You remember every Tuesday, Stan came to the Independence Inn for lunch?"
"LORELAI: I remember."
"SOOKIE: That was a total waste because he couldn't eat dairy, or salt, or meat, so he basically just came in every week for a salad, with no oil, and no mushrooms. [Quietly] He hated mushrooms."
"RORY: [Choking up] I hate mushrooms too."
"LORELAI: [Giving a Kleenex to Rory] Oh, here you go. [To Sookie] You know, he called last week and made the first lunch reservation at the Dragonfly."
"RORY: He did?"
"SOOKIE: Don't cancel it."
"LORELAI: No, of course not. We'll save a seat for Stan."
"RORY: [Choking up again] Save him a seat..."
"[Patty finishes singing, the rabbi now steps up to the platform]"
"RABBI: You'll find The Mourners' Kaddish on page 453. ""May his illustrious name become increasingly great and holy..."
"LORELAI: Hey, did you ever notice that in Stars Hollow death comes in fives?"
"RORY: Do not try to lighten the mood!"
"LORELAI: I'm not, it's true!"
"SOOKIE: It is?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, last year: Chester Thompson, Sarah Merrymen, Fran, and the Dublin twins."
"SOOKIE: That's right."
"LORELAI: Yeah, year before: Chuck O'Mishner, Santos Perez Jr, Santos Perez Sr -"
"SOOKIE: [Gasps] ...Perry Lewis and Charlie Slater, you're right!"
"LORELAI: And now, Pinochle Downs, Mr. Angelotopolous -"
"SOOKIE: Mrs. Krenz!"
"LORELAI: And Stan."
"RORY: Wait a minute, that's only four."
"LORELAI: It is only four."
"SOOKIE: That means the fifth hasn't happened yet."
"RABBI: Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted -"
"SOOKIE: Number five could be in this room right now."
"LORELAI: Oh, no."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Hank Krutzman!"
"RORY: Hank Krutzman?"
"SOOKIE: Why would it be Hank Krutzman?"
"LORELAI: Because he's 110!"
"RORY: [In disbelief] Hank's 110?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why would you say that?"
"LORELAI: Because, that's the age you say when someone is really old."
"RORY: I don't."
"LORELAI: What age do you say?"
"RORY: I say the age they are, otherwise I would seem cruel and insensitive."
"LORELAI: Fine, the point is he is very, very old."
"RORY: Well that doesn't make him number five."
"LORELAI: I don't know..."
"SOOKIE: Hank Krutzman. He was such a happy guy."
"LORELAI: He had such a good life."
"SOOKIE: He owned those horses."
"LORELAI: He loved his golf."
"RORY: Stop!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: You guys just eulogized Hank! He's not even dead yet."
"RABBI: At this time, I would like to call up Stan's dear friend and fellow Rotary Club member, Reverand Skinner."
"LORELAI: Ok, but if we do think it's Hank -"
"RORY: We don't think it's Hank."
"SOOKIE: Why not?"
"RORY: Because if we think it's Hank, and then something happens and it turns out to be Hank, then we caused it."
"LORELAI: She's right."
"SOOKIE: It's not Hank."
"RORY: So now, let's just focus on Stan because he's dead, and we had nothing to do with that."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"SOOKIE: Right."
"REVEREND SKINNER: My good friend Stan Green lived here for 56 years. He loved this town and it's friendly people, charming stores and beautiful church bells. Now, many of you don't remember the church bells. They fell into disrepair about 20 years ago and have been quiet ever since. But Stan remembered those bells, and it was his wish that they ring out over Stars Hollow once again, so he generously bequeathed the funds to make that dream come true. [The church whispers excitedly.] We're going to restore the bells in honor of our dear friend Stan, and every time they ring we'll think of him. He will be missed, but never forgotten."
"RORY: [Crying into her Kleenex] Oh, Stan."
"RABBI: Thank you, Reverend. [Shakes his hand] And now, please join us in saying goodbye at the cemetery."
"[Everyone stands and makes their way to the door]"
"SOOKIE: That's so sweet."
"LORELAI: Yeah, do you remember the bells?"
"SOOKIE: No, it was before my time."
"LORELAI: Me too, sounds great."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, they were fantastic. One of my most romantic memories happened during those bells."
"RORY: Your first kiss?"
"MISS PATTY: Uh, sure. Oh-kay."
"[Hank Krutzman stumbles and falls behind them]"
"LORELAI: Oh, no!"
"SOOKIE: Hank!"
"LORELAI: Okay. He's okay, he's okay."
"RORY: Oh, thank god."
"LORELAI: We are going to be very stressed out for the rest of Hank's life."
"RORY: Serves us right for making him the fifth."
"LORELAI: Hey, we did not make him the fifth, we do not have the power."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, we just speculated."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that was it, for all we know anyone could be the fifth."
"SOOKIE: That's right, it could be anyone. I mean Taylor, or Reggie, or Andrew or Kirk."
"[Kirk falls into the flowers and hits the ground]"
"KIRK: OW! Oh! Going dark, going dark!"
"LORELAI: We are the Witches of Eastwick."
"[Opening Credits]"
"GILMORE GARAGE"
"[Lane's band is practicing. They are finishing a song.]"
"LANE: Yeah!"
"BRAIN: Perfect."
"GIL: That middle-A drum roll was awesome!"
"LANE: So keep it?"
"GIL: Keep it!"
"LANE: Zach, you seem less than thrilled?"
"GIL: Yeah man, you look like my seven year old when she's all grumpy-puss."
"ZACH: Look, far be it from me to complain -"
"BRIAN: Since when?"
"ZACH: Don't be a putz."
"BRAIN: But you complain a lot."
"ZACH: I just think we're a little too on the b*at, that's all."
"LANE: Too on the b*at. That's crazy."
"BRIAN: How can we be too on the b*at?"
"LANE: We should be off the b*at?"
"ZACH: Hey, fine, sorry I brought it up. Let's just play perfectly on the b*at and add a laser show and a flute and be ""prog"" rock, if that's what you want."
"LANE: We're just trying to figure out what you mean, Zach. So, we're too perfect?"
"ZACH: I think."
"BRIAN: Are we practicing too much?"
"LANE: We don't practice too much, we're just good."
"ZACH: I don't want to sound all fake and computerized, alright? I don't wanna be N*Sync."
"GIL: [Slowly] N*Sync, what's that?"
"BRIAN: N*Sync is one of those sucky boy-bands."
"GIL: Oh, I'm rock and roll, I don't know anything about boy-bands."
"ZACH: I don't either, I've just read about them."
"LANE: You read about N*Sync?"
"BRIAN: What are they, like a guilty pleasure for you or something?"
"GIL: Hey, if we're getting confessional and all, I kinda like Simon and Garfunkel."
"LANE: I've always had this thing for Fleetwood Mac, I'm embarrassed to say."
"BRIAN: [Shyly] Sarah McLachlan. [Puts a hand on Zachs shoulder.] So, N*Sync?"
"ZACH: [Shrugs off his hand] I'm not into N*Sync!. I just read a lot about music, and I've read about them, and I don't read, I skim!"
"GIL: Hey, as far as the b*at goes, we can loosen things up a bit. I mean, I know I can."
"ZACH: That's all I'm saying. A little more Stones, a little less Kraftwerk."
"GIL: Well, are we takin' a break now? I gotta make a call."
"LANE: Yeah, let's take a break. [Gil leaves] You're so mean to him."
"ZACH: No, I'm not."
"LANE: He knows exactly who you're talking about, and he's so nice."
"BRIAN: Yeah, I mean he gets here early, he brings sandwiches from his shop."
"ZACH: Never an Italian sub with pickles, which is what I like, I must say."
"LANE: I would rather you gave me the hard time instead of Gil, since I'm the one who let him in the band."
"ZACH: Hey, we all let him in, we're a democracy, we all let him in the band."
"LANE: Fine, we all let him in, so we should all remember that."
"[Gil runs into the garage]"
"GIL: You guys are not going to believe this, not in a million years."
"LANE: Xander win a soccer match?"
"GIL: No, that's at 4:00 tomorrow. We, the band, are booked ... at CBGB's."
"ZACH: We're what?"
"GIL: Dude, we have a gig at CBGB's."
"LANE: CBGB's in New York?"
"GIL: No, in Hackensack. Joke, dudes, the one in New York."
"LANE: Oh My God!"
"ZACH: Gil, come on, are you serious?"
"GIL: Dude, I am always serious about rock and roll."
"LANE: How did this happen?"
"GIL: My buddy Pete works sound there? I got him a tape, he slipped it to the booker, and BAM, we're in."
"LANE: Holy bam!"
"BRIAN: I need my inhaler."
"GIL: Now, it's not a great slot; It's 1:00 on a Tuesday night."
"LANE: Who cares? It's CBGB's!"
"BRIAN: The Ramones started there!"
"ZACH: Wow."
"LANE: Blondie, Sonic Youth, Television, Talking Heads...the list goes on and on."
"GIL: I said yes. It's okay to say yes? [Lane looks at him in disbelief before grabbing and hugging him] I guess it's okay..."
"BRAIN: [Puffs his inhaler and gives Gil a thumbs up.]"
"STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE"
"[The ground is covered in snow, and children make snowmen and snow angels as Lorelai and Rory walk along the sidewalk.]"
"LORELAI: Sure is pretty, isn't it?"
"RORY: Yes, it is."
"LORELAI: I love the first snow of the year."
"RORY: I know, me too, although this isn't actually the first snow of the year."
"LORELAI: It isn't?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: What happened to the first snow of the year?"
"RORY: I had a philosophy final."
"LORELAI: Oh, right."
"RORY: And the second snow of the season was on Wednesday."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I had my walkthrough of the inn."
"RORY: So, actually this is the third snow of the season."
"LORELAI: Fourth, the third was on Saturday."
"RORY: It was? Why didn't you call me?"
"LORELAI: Because, it happened in the middle of the night."
"RORY: Well, you still could have called me."
"LORELAI: In the middle of the night?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: You wanted me to call you, at Yale, in the middle of the night so I could say, ""Hey, drive 20 miles to stand in the snow with Mommy?"""
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: And then take the craziest mother-daughter title from Judy and Liza."
"RORY: So fourth snow of the season."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: Still pretty."
"LORELAI: Yes, we are. [The bells begin to ring from the church.] The bells, they fixed the bells."
"RORY: Oh, Stan."
"[Reverend Skinner looks up from the church stairs. People emerge from stores and children stop playing to listen. As the bells finish, people applaud.]"
"LORELAI: See, if we had taken our traditional ""first snow of the season"" walk, we wouldn't have heard the bells."
"RORY: Bless our oppressive schedules. I have to go drop something off at Lane's."
"LORELAI: Good, 'cause I have to go drop something off at Luke's. [Begins to cross the street]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: [Turns around.] I'm just dropping off some stuff, and a few things and -"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: I need coffee."
"RORY: I'll meet you there."
"LORELAI: Hurry, we can come back out for the bells in half an hour."
"RORY: Order me some coffee, a muffin and some onion rings."
"LORELAI: Look what I pass on to the next generation."
"RORY: Eating habits from Hades."
"LORELAI: [Calling after her] Love that DNA!"
"KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lane and other students from the Adventist College sit in chairs in a small circle]"
"MARLA: Pursue an interview with a distinguished leader with great influence on the community state or nation."
"LANE: Well, that sounds like it should be interesting. Who should we interview? [Jordan raises a finger] Oh, Jordan!"
"JORDAN: Pastor Cho is available."
"LANE: Yes! [Mock enthusiasm] Pastor Cho would be interesting and …convenient since his house is right on campus, so okay, good option in Pastor Cho. Any other suggestions?"
"ANDY: [Eagerly] Assistant Pastor Eric?"
"LANE: Yes. Assistant Pastor Eric, also a fine idea, he lives next door to Pastor Cho. Would anyone like to think outside the clergy?"
"MARLA: Why?"
"JORDAN: Pastor Cho did it last year."
"MARLA: Pastor Cho does it every year."
"LANE: So then perhaps Pastor Cho might like a rest?"
"ANDY: Then it would be Assistant Pastor Eric!"
"LANE: Hey, I have an idea. How about we send a letter to Bill Clinton. It's probably be a long sh*t, but you never know!"
"MARLA: Bill Clinton?"
"LANE: Yeah!"
"JORDAN: But Pastor Cho is expecting our call."
"ANDY: Unless he's sick, in which case it would be Assistant Pastor Eric!"
"LANE: Yes, but I -"
"MRS. KIM.: Lane! Rory is here to see you."
"[Rory stands near the door with a large book in her arms]"
"LANE: Rory! Hi, and bless you."
"RORY: Lane! Hi and … thank you."
"LANE: Rory, this is Andy, Sarah, Jill, Marla and Jordan."
"RORY: Nice to meet you all. I didn't mean to interrupt, I just wanted to return your book and get another one."
"LANE: Oh, of course. [To Mrs. Kim] I'll be right back"
"MRS. KIM: Please hurry, the tea is almost ready."
"LANE: I will."
"[Enters her room and Rory follows.]"
"LANE: So, how did you like it?"
"[Rory opens the book to reveal a hollow space where a CD is hidden.]"
"RORY: It's great, I b*rned a copy for my Mom."
"LANE: You know, its people like you who are destroying the music industry!"
"RORY: Oh, now. Britney's gotta shoulder some of the blame."
"[Lane opens up one of her floorboards]"
"LANE: Let me see. How about The New Pornographers?"
"RORY: Sold. [Lane hands her a CD, and Lane opens another floorboard to return the CD Rory borrowed] So, it's quite a lively bunch you got down there."
"LANE: Oh yeah, I'm kind of worried, all of those breakables."
"RORY: What are you working on?"
"LANE: Oh, the usual: how to avoid any contact with the outside world."
"RORY: Hmm, those guys must really be screwing up the curve."
"LANE: Yes, it's annoying."
"RORY: Everyday?"
"LANE: Yes, but I could care less because today, all I can think about is the gig! I mean, I can't believe it! I'm actually going to be on stage at [high pitched] CBGBs!"
"RORY: I know, but how are you going to [high pitched] get there?"
"LANE: Oh, I will get there. As we speak, I am working on the perfect alibi."
"RORY: Oh, what do ya got so far?"
"LANE: [motions for Rory to sit] Mama, may I run something past you? That's it."
"RORY: I like it."
"LANE: Yeah, so I was originally gonna start with ""Can I run something past you,"" but I thought the may I added a certain level of respect."
"RORY: I agree. However, you now need to add an excuse."
"LANE: [pacing] I've come up with lots of, you know, mid-afternoon and evening alibis, but so far no 1:00 AM alibis."
"RORY: You can always tell your Mom that you're sleeping over at my dorm."
"LANE: She knows they're co-ed. By the way, she's praying for you. So, you wanna borrow the new Sparks?"
"RORY: Please! Oh, now how about this? Tell your Mom that you're taking an astronomy class, and you have to go on a field trip to look at the stars."
"LANE: There are no astronomy classes at Adventist College. That would imply the universe is old."
"RORY: Not a lot of loopholes in your world, huh?"
"LANE: It's okay, I'll come up with something. My entire life has been a training session for this very event."
"RORY: I have faith in you."
"LANE: Thank you."
"[They head to the door. Lane stops Rory.]"
"LANE: Wait! [Lane takes out a new book cover to make it look like Rory has borrowed a new book]"
"RORY: Oop! Getting a little sloppy, there."
"[They get the cover on the book when the door bursts open.]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane! Your classmates are waiting."
"LANE: Sorry, Mama."
"RORY: Um, well, I gotta go. Thank you for the book. Bye, Mrs. Kim."
"MRS. KIM: Wait! [Rory stops. Mrs. Kim takes the book and looks at the cover] ""Jane -- One woman's harrowing journey to God."" Good choice!"
"RORY: Thank you, ma'am. [Hurries out]"
"YALE"
"[Rory and Paris are walking through the hallways]"
"PARIS: Smart move, jumping on my bandwagon with the International Relations Association."
"RORY: Like I had a choice."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: You dragged me here, Paris."
"PARIS: You'll thank me when you're interviewing for grad school in a few years and find those waifish looks of yours aren't quite as charming."
"RORY: Whatever that means."
"PARIS: It means these kind of clubs look good on your resumé."
"RORY: You know what also looks good on a resumé? Passing your classes."
"PARIS: No one studies more than you do, you're fine. Now, remember to argue, even if you have nothing to say, or add, be vocal. Very few people in lifelisten to what anyone else says anyhow. It's all about volume."
"RORY: Can I ask why you're suddenly so interested in international relations? You're pre-med."
"PARIS: It's critical to step out of one's major and experience our worlds sweeping expanse. Plus, a certain fellow told me about it."
"RORY: Okay, enough with that."
"PARIS: [Looks at the advisor for the discussion] Oh, this is too much. [She signs her name to a clipboard.]"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Our advisor, Professor Friedman."
"RORY: You know her? [Rory signs as well]"
"PARIS: Of her. Her daughter was busted last spring by New Haven police for growing pot in their basement, right during harvest season. Strangely, it never made the papers."
"RORY: Then how do you know about it?"
"PARIS: A certain fellow told me."
"RORY: I have got to stop asking questions."
"[They walk around the table. Rory looks over and sees the guy she asked out for coffee in the laundry room enter. Rory looks at him, but he catches her eye and she quickly looks away, embarrassed. ]"
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Kirk is sitting at one end of the counter while Luke is leaning over the counter at the opposite side, looking at some papers.]"
"KIRK: Luke?"
"LUKE: [Irritated] Yeah, Kirk."
"KIRK: What time is it?"
"LUKE: I'm not saying, Kirk."
"KIRK: Why not?"
"LUKE: Because I just told you 30 seconds ago!"
"KIRK: More like 45 seconds if you add in all the bickering."
"LUKE: [Sighs] 3:58."
"KIRK: Only two minutes until the bells."
"LUKE: Unless of course, I'm fast."
"KIRK: You're cruel at times, Luke."
"LUKE: Only when poked with a stick."
"[Lorelai walks in and sits at a stool.]"
"LORELAI: Coffee, big cup and hello!"
"KIRK: Lorelai, what time do you have?"
"LUKE: Do not tell him. He already knows."
"KIRK: I do not!"
"LUKE: If you just wait for the bells, then you'll get to hear the bells, and then you'll know what time it is."
"KIRK: Actually, that's not true. The other day I stood too close to the bells and they rang so loud that there's now a persistent ringing in my ears. Now I can't tell which are the church bells and which are the Kirk bells."
"LORELAI: [Mock concern] Oh, no. Did you go to the doctor?"
"KIRK: Yes, he said I have tinnitis. I looked it up on the web at ""Celebrities Who Share Your Disease"" and found that William Shatner is likewise afflicted."
"LORELAI: Really, Kirk and Captain Kirk?"
"KIRK: The irony wasn't lost on me. [He hears Luke place two plates onto a table. Looking up,] Was that them?"
"LUKE: Relax, the church bells will be the loud obnoxious ones. [Walks behind the counter.]"
"LORELAI: Uhp somebody doesn't like bells."
"LUKE: Not everyone likes bells."
"LORELAI: No, actually they do."
"LUKE: They enjoy the constant interruptions of conversations, the monotonous drone of the same tones, hour after hour?"
"LORELAI: Yes! Can you believe it? These are the same freaks who also like sunsets and the moon and the stars … [Sees Luke ruffling through the papers again.] What are the paint chips for?"
"LUKE: Oh, I'm just doing some painting."
"LORELAI: Oh, really? You're not gonna collect and trade them amongst your friends? What are you painting?"
"LUKE: Um, our apartment."
"LORELAI: You and I, we're getting an apartment?"
"LUKE: No. Me and Nicole. We're getting an apartment."
"LORELAI: [pause] Oh! That's great. When?"
"LUKE: When what?"
"LORELAI: Well, when are you getting an apartment?"
"LUKE: Three weeks ago."
"LORELAI: Three weeks … You moved already?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Huh. Uh, wow. So, where is the apartment?"
"LUKE: Litchfield. [Walks around the counter]"
"LORELAI: [Taken aback] You moved to Litchfield?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: [Turning to face him] Three weeks ago you moved to Litchfield?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Litchfield is another county."
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Well, [sighs as she turns again and he goes behind the counter.] Three weeks ago you moved to another county?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Well, were you gonna mention this to me anytime soon?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: When?"
"LUKE: When it came up."
"LORELAI: When it came up."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Okay, so if I hadn't asked for the next twenty or thirty years and I sent you a nice fruit basket upstairs you just never would have gotten it."
"LUKE: It's not that big a deal."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: I mean it's not like we tell each other everything."
"LORELAI: No! Of course we don't! I mean, I tore a pair of panty hose this morning and I didn't tell you about it. Oh wait, I guess I just did."
"LUKE: Hey, you know now, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Right."
"LUKE: Look, nothing's changed."
"LORELAI: Yeah nothing's changed, except you don't live here!"
"LUKE: So what?"
"LORELAI: So? I don't even have your phone number."
"LUKE: I'll give you my phone number."
"LORELAI: I don't even know what you live in! An apartment, a trailer, a batcave -"
"LUKE: A townhouse."
"LORELAI: A townhouse? Sure, 'cause when I look at you I think ""common driveway""."
"LUKE: It's fine, you'll come over and see it eventually."
"LORELAI: Will I? Will I come over, because me coming over implies we're friends!"
"LUKE: We are friends!"
"LORELAI: No, we're not! We're not friends! Friends tell each other at least the most basic things like where you live and when you moved away. I thought we were friends but I guess we're not! [Stands and reaches for her coat.]"
"LUKE: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I can't stay! [Leaves]"
"LUKE: [Calling after her] Lorelai! [The bells ring.] Damn bells!"
"YALE"
"[Rory and two other girls sit around a coffee table as one girl sorts through a box.]"
"GIRL: Oh! This is the tragedy that results when your mom goes out of town leaving your dad in charge of the care package."
"RORY: [Looking at a can] Cling peaches in light syrup."
"GIRL: They make Rice Krispies Treats in foil packs now, how hard is that?"
"RORY: Oh, hey, want your smile back? [Holding up a package] Pork Top Ramen."
"GIRL: For that, you share your care package."
"RORY: Fine. My mom doesn't bake but she knows people who do."
"GIRL #2: [Holding the ramen] This makes great packing material…"
"GIRL: Look, look, look. The guy over by the vending machine."
"[Pan to the laundry room guy pouring himself coffee]"
"GIRL #2: Two thumbs up!"
"GIRL: That is my friend Josh's roommate, William."
"GIRL #2: [Fanning herself] Ah! Hello your highness."
"GIRL: I'm seriously debating a move here."
"GIRL #2: Nakedness tends to work."
"GIRL: I met him at this party this weekend. He's pretty cool - and funny! He tells this story about a girl in this dorm. She doesn't even know him, she just comes up to him and starts talking to him, and he's talking to her, you know, just to be nice, but she thinks he's into her or something, so like three seconds later she asks him out. [Rory begins to look uncomfortable] Of course he said no. But I guess to her no doesn't mean 'no', so now she's showing up everywhere he is. He calls her his ""adoring fan."""
"GIRL #2: Did he say who it was?"
"GIRL: Someone cranked up the karaoke machine right at that moment so no, no names. But his impression of her asking him out, all flitty eyelashes and 'look how hot I am' is hilarious. [Rory is looking very uncomfortable now.]"
"GIRL #2: Oooh, intrigue. Psycho girl in the dorm. I wonder who it can be?"
"GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Sookie and Lorelai sit on the couch. Sookie is flipping though decorating magazines.]"
"SOOKIE: So, now that he lives in Litchfield, what's that supposed to mean?"
"LORELAI: According to Luke, nothing!"
"SOOKIE: But what about the diner?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he said the diner's fine, everything's fine!"
"SOOKIE: And he's gonna continue working here even though he's living there?"
"LORELAI: Yes, apparently he'll go from being grumpy Luke to grumpy-commuter Luke."
"SOOKIE: Luke plus road-rage, there's a healthy combination. Ooh! [Holding out magazine] What do you think of that sconce?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it's too British. I swear, that guy should work for the CIA. He gives away nothing, absolutely nothing!"
"SOOKIE: I have friends there."
"LORELAI: What? Where?"
"SOOKIE: The CIA."
"LORELAI: [laughs] No, you don't."
"SOOKIE: Yes, I - Ah, you didn't mean the Culinary Institute of America?"
"LORELAI: No."
"SOOKIE: Okay, then. Oh! [Holding out magazine] What about this?"
"LORELAI: No, too Spanish. Three weeks he's been living there! Three weeks, and not a single word, and he looked at me like I was completely insane to be upset."
"SOOKIE: What about this one?"
"LORELAI: Too German."
"SOOKIE: How can a sconce be too German?"
"LORELAI: It's shaped like an knockwurst."
"SOOKIE: It is not. Oh, it is. Why would they do that?"
"LORELAI: Maybe I am insane, I mean what's the big deal right? Just because I go in there for coffee every day that doesn't make us friends."
"SOOKIE: You are friends!"
"LORELAI: Yes, but I thought we were 'friend' friends, and apparently we're just coffee friends. I buy the coffee and he's my friend. It's like a dog and a liver treat. If you have a liver treat, the dog will like you and, that's us."
"SOOKIE: Which one are you, the dog or the liver treat?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was the liver treat, and I thought I was a collar or at least a really cute leash and I'm not."
"SOOKIE: I wanna chime in and be supportive, but I don't know what you're talking about."
"LORELAI: I'm talking about nothing, nevermind."
"[Davie begins to cry.]"
"SOOKIE: Oh. I'm coming, Cookie."
"LORELAI: What's the matter, is he hungry?"
"SOOKIE: No, it's the bells."
"LORELAI: The bells aren't ringing."
"SOOKIE: No, but they're about to."
"LORELAI: He's crying in anticipation of the bells?"
"SOOKIE: He hates them. At first he just cried when they rang, and now he knows their schedule."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's terrible!"
"SOOKIE: Believe me, the 5:00 AM-ers are the worst."
"[The bells begin to ring]"
"SOOKIE: Oh, oh, I know."
"LORELAI: Poor thing. [Looking to the window] Hey, Sookie. [Walking to the window] Look, it's Luke."
"SOOKIE: What's he doing?"
"[Luke is outside on her front path shovelling snow]"
"LORELAI: Hmph, he's shovelling my walk. [smiles]"
"SOOKIE: He's good."
"LORELAI: I'll be right back."
"OUTSIDE GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai walks out the front door, pulling on her jacket.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, you missed a spot. [Luke doesn't stop shovelling] This is really nice Luke. Hey, can we fight again 'cause I need my rain gutters cleaned."
"LUKE: [Stops shovelling and walks up to the foot of the stairs.] You think everything is your business. Everything is about you! Well, here's a newsflash. Some things are not about you."
"LORELAI: Why are you yelling at me?"
"LUKE: If I want to move in with Nicole, it concerns her and it concerns me, and that is it."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know."
"LUKE: It does not concern you! It is none of your business! I don't have to tell you anything! And you do not have the right to make me feel guilty because I didn't tell you anything."
"LORELAI: I wasn't trying -"
"LUKE: I have been tying my own shoes since I was I was four, I have repairing my own car since I was fourteen, and I have been making my own decisions since I could crawl!"
"LORELAI: What does any of that have to do with anything?"
"LUKE: I owe you nothing!"
"LORELAI: Fine."
"LUKE: Nothing!"
"LORELAI: Fine!"
"LUKE: And shovel your walk! It is a safety hazard and you can't just walk past it and ignore the fact that the snow is up to your ass!"
"LORELAI: You've got my shovel!"
"LUKE: [Holding up the shovel] I loaned it to you three years ago!"
"[Luke stomps off and Lorelai goes into the house]"
"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS ASSOCIATION"
"[Rory, Paris, William the laundry room guy and other students all sit around a table]"
"PARIS: When you boil it down, isn't the whole Israeli-Palestinian problem a case of sibling rivalry?"
"FRIEDMAN: Follow up?"
"PARIS: The Old Testament, it's all there. Israelis are descendents of Abraham and Sarah. Arabs are descendents of Abraham and his maid Hagar. So Israelis and Arabs both have the same dad, and both want the great nation God promised Abraham. They might as well be fighting over who gets the TV remote. [Rory drops her pencil and it roll in from of William. He picks it up.]"
"FRIEDMAN: Your Biblical facts are correct, Paris, but your arguments disregard the complexities of the last 4000 years. I know research takes time."
"PARIS: At least I don't have to worry about Cheech growing Thai stick in the rec room."
"FRIEDMAN: What?"
"PARIS: Nothing."
"FRIEDMAN: Okay. Anyone else?"
"WILLIAM: It's just a power struggle, nothing mysterious."
"FRIEDMAN: Follow up?"
"WILLIAM: Who wins in this game? And in whose best interest is it to keep the kids fighting?"
"RORY: Right, like they're some all powerful entity, manipulating the entire population of Israel. There's a good thought process for you."
"WILLIAM: Excuse me?"
"RORY: It's more complex than that."
"WILLIAM: But if you disregard power -"
"RORY: That's not what I said. Maybe if you sat up straight for a minute you could hear a little more clearly."
"FRIEDMAN: Decorum, people."
"RORY: Israel is made up of over 6 million individuals, each with a unique view on the situation. You know something about a unique view of a situation, don't you?"
"WILLIAM: I guess -"
"RORY: Because propaganda and the spreading of blatant, heinous, ridiculous lies can cause more damage than g*n or b*mb or any sort of w*apon."
"WILLIAM: Personally, if I'm in an alley with Osama, I'd rather he was armed with a blatant, heinous lie than an Uzi."
"RORY: That's cause you're an idiot."
"WILLIAM: You know, you didn't look scary when you came in here."
"RORY: Oh yeah, give me back my pencil. [He throws the pencil in front of her.]"
"FRIEDMAN: Okay, you two. Let's take a cooling off period and hear from someone else. Sarah, your thoughts on this."

"GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Night, Lorelai lies on the couch talking to Rory on the phone, who is lying in bed studying at Yale]"
"LORELAI: I'm starving."
"RORY: Order a pizza."
"LORELAI: No, it's snowing, they won't deliver."
"RORY: Then go to Al's."
"LORELAI: It's curry night!"
"RORY: China Charlie's sounds pretty good."
"LORELAI: I hate Chinese."
"RORY: Since when?"
"LORELAI: Since tonight!"
"RORY: You're acting like a four year old."
"LORELAI: I don't care, I'm bored."
"RORY: This is stupid, just go to Luke's."
"LORELAI: No. Way."
"RORY: Oh, come on, you guys always fight."
"LORELAI: Not like this."
"RORY: And then you make up."
"LORELAI: No, I'm not going to Luke's."
"RORY: You're gonna starve to death."
"LORELAI: Well fine, I will starve to death, because I'm not going to reward bad behavior."
"RORY: Is there something in the fridge?"
"LORELAI: Nothing edible."
"RORY: There's Beefaroni. You like Beefaroni."
"LORELAI: I'm not in the mood for Beefaroni."
"RORY: Mom, you have to do something."
"LORELAI: I need a suggestion."
"RORY: Have you read The Bell Jar?"
"LORELAI: Huh! Not funny!"
"RORY: Okay, you know what, you're on your own."
"LORELAI: No, no! Come on!"
"RORY: I have to study and you're in your stubborn mood."
"LORELAI: Hey! I sat up with you all night when you had the chicken pox. I held your hands so that you couldn't scratch your face and scar your perfect skin. You look that way because of me."
"RORY: Night, mom."
"LORELAI: But, ah, the chicken pox!"
"RORY: Beefaroni, it's calling you!"
"[Rory hangs up. Lorelai scoffs.]"
"STARS HOLLOW, NIGHT"
"[The bells ring the hour as Lorelai walks past Doose's Market, which displays sales on earplugs and aspirin. Two people walk by her and shout out, ""Shut up!"" Patty is teaching a class.]"
"MISS PATTY: [claping] One, and two, and three and four. Ignore the bells, they aren't the b*at. The bells will screw, it all to hell."
"[Lorelai looks into Luke's diner and sees Luke disappear behind the curtain with a box]"
"MISS PATTY: And one, and two, and three, and four... [The bells stop.] and … one… and two and three and four..."
"[Lorelai walks into Luke's diner and as the bells jingle, Luke steps back out from the curtain. He folds his arms when he sees Lorelai and she walks towards him.]"
"LORELAI: You want to help me break the bells?"
"LUKE: I'll get my toolbox."
"[Luke goes upstairs, Lorelai gets a donut and follows him.]"
"LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[They both walk in]"
"LUKE: I'll just be a sec."
"LORELAI: 'Kay."
"[Luke walks away for a second. Lorelai looks around quizzically as she notices that all of his belongings are still in the apartment. There are even dirty dishes in the sink and on the table, and his bed in the corner is not made. Lorelai walks over to Luke, who has just gotten his toolbox out of the closet.]"
"LUKE: Got it, let's go. [Walks to the door]"
"LORELAI: Right behind you."
"CBGBs"
"[Lane and the rest of the band are in a back room waiting to go on. Lane is drumming on the walls as she walks around. She drums on Zach's lap.]"
"ZACH: Hey!"
"LANE: Sorry, Zach, anything immobile is fair game. [To Gil] I'm so hyped."
"GIL: Me too."
"LANE: Did you find Blondie anywhere?"
"GIL: No, I think they repainted at some point."
"LANE: Repainting is so not rock and roll! [As Zach walks by, she drums on his back.]"
"ZACH: [Turning on her] You have seriously gotta stop that."
"LANE: Sue me."
"GIL: [Pointing to the wall] Hey, here are The Strokes!"
"ZACH: Yawn. [To Brian.] Hey, you almost done, you've been tuning for a half hour."
"BRIAN: [Holding a guitar.] Almost. Geez, I'm nervous."
"ZACH: Yeah, you're shaking like the Pope."
"BRIAN: [Handing him the guitar.] You do it for me."
"ZACH: Fine."
"BRIAN: So, do we get to sign the wall?"
"LANE: Oh, we are signing the wall! It's the whole reason to be in the band, that and the loose chicks."
"GIL: [Pointing to the wall.] Here are The Strokes again!"
"ZACH: Yeah, they're over there too."
"BRIAN: Man, they're overexposed, even on walls. [Puffs his inhaler]"
"[Darryl wearing a CBGB's shirt and carrying a clipboard enters.]"
"DARRYL: Hey guys, uh, bad news. I'm gonna have to bump you."
"LANE: [Running up.] What?"
"BRIAN: What does that mean?"
"DARRYL: Uh, it means you're bumped. You're not playing. We'll reschedule, okay?"
"GIL: Drag!"
"ZACH: I guess I can stop tuning."
"LANE: No, no, don't stop tuning. I don't get this, why are we being bumped?"
"DARRYL: Well, there's like two people out in the audience and they're born again or something, and they're not even drinking."
"LANE: Well, I'll get 'em drinking, I'm very good at working around religious mandates."
"BRIAN: Older couple?"
"DARRYL: Yeah."
"BRIAN: That's my parents. They don't drink."
"LANE: We'll just play for Brian's parents, that's fine with us."
"ZACH: This is unbelievable!"
"GIL: Look guys, it happens."
"LANE: I'm sorry, we're playing tonight."
"GIL: To an empty room."
"LANE: Every band plays to empty rooms at some point. They can be the most classic gigs."
"DARRYL: Look, I've already sent people home. The doorman, the waitresses-"
"LANE: You don't need them, there's no one out there."
"DARRYL: The sound guy."
"LANE: We don't need sound!"
"DARRYL: Look, it's not up to you. We'll reschedule, okay?"
"ZACH: [To Gil] Nice goin', dude."
"BRIAN: Don't dump on Gil!"
"LANE: [Catching Darryl before he leaves.] Excuse me, we're not done."
"DARRYL: Oh, I think we are."
"LANE: No, we are not just little gnats that you can flick away. We are professionals and some of us have gone through a lot of trouble to be here tonight, a lot of trouble."
"DARRYL: Well, then you have a lot of my sympathies. [He leaves] I need a cigarette."
"LANE: [Screaming after him] Get cancer, Darryl!"
"GIL: Wow, Lane! Come on, you gotta roll with the punches."
"LANE: No, we have to play tonight."
"GIL: We can't!"
"LANE: [Sees the guys packing up their stuff] What are you doing?"
"BRIAN: Packing up?"
"LANE: Just because Darryl said to?"
"BRIAN: He's the booker."
"LANE: No, he's the man, and rock and roll is about saying no to the man!"
"ZACH: This is a lot of trouble for nothing!"
"LANE: Guys!"
"GIL: I said I'm sorry!"
"BRIAN: It's not Gil's fault!"
"ZACH: Then whose is it?"
"GIL: Look, you gotta roll with the punches too, Zach."
"ZACH: [To Brian] You just stepped on my guitar!"
"BRIAN: I didn't see it."
"ZACH: What are you blind?"
"BRIAN: Pretty much."
"GIL: Dude, get it together."
"ZACH: I cannot believe that your parents don't drink."
"[Lane is wringing her hands and looking very worried.]"
"STARS HOLLOW, NIGHT"
"[Lorelai and Luke walk up to the church. Lorelai tries the door but it is locked.]"
"LORELAI: [Gasp] What, they lock the door to a church, are they serious? What if I need to do something holy?"
"LUKE: Like commit vandalism?"
"LORELAI: Even she's sick of hearing the damn bells."
"LUKE: I'm gonna have to break the lock"
"LORELAI: No wait. [Gets out her wallet]"
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: All those years of watching Hart to Hart are about to pay off."
"LUKE: What is that?"
"LORELAI: It's my gym card."
"LUKE: You joined a gym?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: When?"
"LORELAI: After I had Rory, to lose the pregnancy weight."
"LUKE: Did you go?"
"LORELAI: God, no. I was way too fat. [Manages to unlock the door with the card] Ah, praise be to Him and all the little lambs that frolic the earth with their frankincense and myrrh and -"
"LUKE: Would you get inside?"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"STARS HOLLOW CHURCH"
"[The church is in darkness as Lorelai and Luke walk up the aisle.]"
"LORELAI: Oy! Would it k*ll God to dust?"
"LUKE: Okay, now just hold the flashlight, do not do any moving spotlight gags and point it at me and yell ""Freeze, drop your w*apon."""
"LORELAI: [laughs] How about if I shine it on the wall and do a dirty hand puppet show?"
"LUKE: Just stand back so the lightning only strikes you."
"LORELAI: So, what's the game plan here? Personally, I thought we could whack the bells really hard with a hammer."
"LUKE: Uh, you don't break bells with a hammer."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm out. What's your plan, Clyde?"
"LUKE: Well, I was thinking we could just jam the turnbuckle, or wedge the main mechanism, just for fun disconnect a few of the clappers; Contrary to popular belief you don't have to break every bell. If you just damage a couple, say the tierce and the prime, you pretty much ruin the set."
"LORELAI: You must have been the top of your class at hunchback school."
"LUKE: Well, let's just say you can wait your whole life waiting for bells to fall into disrepair. Sometimes they need a push."
"LORELAI: No way! You broke the bells."
"LUKE: You're welcome. It's a little narrow up there, so we should just take the tools that we need, leave the toolbox down here."
"LORELAI: God, these things are heavy. Don't you have a smaller toolbox?"
"LUKE: No, why would I have two toolboxes?"
"LORELAI: 'Cause then you'd have a big one and a small one."
"LUKE: Well, if you have a big one you don't need a small one. [Lorelai opens her mouth to speak] Don't say 'dirty', it's too easy. Hold these. [Gives her tools]"
"LORELAI: So, um, why wasn't your toolbox at your new place?"
"LUKE: I needed it here."
"LORELAI: Huh. Usually moving requires lots of tools; hanging things, putting things together."
"LUKE: Nicole hired a professional picture-hanger and we didn't have anything to put together. Hand me a screwdriver."
"LORELAI: Phillips or flathead? [Luke looks at her in surprise] I know things."
"LUKE: Phillips. [She hands it to him and Luke smiles.]"
"LORELAI: Luke, how come you told me you moved?"
"LUKE: I did move."
"LORELAI: Well, you may have moved, but none of your stuff did."
"LUKE: What are you talking about? Uh, hand me the open-ended wrench."
"LORELAI: Luke, I was in your apartment. It's exactly the same."
"LUKE: No, it's not."
"LORELAI: I just think it's weird you're pretending you moved when you didn't."
"LUKE: [Stopping working] I did move."
"LORELAI: Luke, your bed wasn't even made."
"LUKE: So?"
"LORELAI: There were dishes in the sink, some kind of shake in the blender, Mega-Man protein powder on the counter. Remind me to mock you for that later, by the way."
"LUKE: Can we talk about something else? Or better yet, let's not talk and just get this done."
"LORELAI: Does Nicole think you moved?"
"LUKE: Of course she thinks I moved, I did move."
"LORELAI: Do you sleep there?"
"LUKE: Of course I sleep there."
"LORELAI: When was the last time you slept there?"
"LUKE: I live there."
"LORELAI: So, last night?"
"LUKE: I had an early delivery and it didn't make sense to sleep there."
"LORELAI: The day before?"
"LUKE: I was there for dinner."
"LORELAI: And after dinner?"
"LUKE: Nicole was getting a sore throat so it made sense to go back to my place and not get sick."
"LORELAI: Your place?"
"LUKE: My old place."
"LORELAI: You didn't say your old place, you said your place."
"LUKE: Well, I meant my old place."
"LORELAI: Luke, you don't live with Nicole."
"LUKE: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: You watch her TV, you eat her food, you keep stuff in a duffel bag at her house; you're a rude guest, not her boyfriend!"
"LUKE: Husband."
"LORELAI: Whole other discussion."
"LUKE: You know what, you're doing it again."
"LORELAI: Doing what again?"
"LUKE: You're passing judgment on my relationship with Nicole."
"LORELAI: I'm not passing judgment."
"LUKE: You passed judgment on our marriage, you passed judgment on our divorce and now you're passing judgment on our living together."
"LORELAI: I'm not passing judgment on you living together. You're passing judgment on you living together… by not living together."
"LUKE: You know, I was a little tipsy on that cruise ship, but I don't remember anyone pronouncing us husband and wife and Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, they may as well have, because I spend as much time with Nicole as you do."
"LUKE: And the judgment's back!"
"LORELAI: I could move in with you guys. You wouldn't know."
"LUKE: You know, none of this is any of your business."
"LORELAI: It's absolutely my business."
"LUKE: How?"
"LORELAI: Because! I wasted a week of my life adjusting to the idea that you had moved only to find out that you haven't moved."
"LUKE: How much adjusting did you have to do? Nothing's changed! I still see you everyday, I still cook your food, I still serve your coffee. What do you care?"
"LORELAI: I care."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because I don't want you to move."
"LUKE: Why? Why don't you want me to move?"
"[Lorelai stares at him for a second, but a door opens behind them and Lorelai and Luke lower their heads guiltily. Reverend Skinner walks in.]"
"REVEREND: Lorelai? Luke? [Sees the tools.] Oh, thank God! Carry on."
"[He leaves.]"
"YALE"
"[There is a knock on Rory's dorm door.]"
"RORY: Paris! It's 4:00 in the morning! [She opens the door and finds Lane standing there.]"
"LANE: Hi."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"LANE: Well, funny you should ask, because I didn't know what to do and you always seem to know what to do, so I thought I'd drop by and ask you what to do."
"RORY: About what?"
"LANE: I didn't come up with one."
"RORY: One what?"
"LANE: One alibi."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: I couldn't think of anything! [She sits down]"
"RORY: Lane!"
"LANE: I swear, I tried, but nothing I came up with sounded like she would believe it so I just left."
"RORY: What do you mean you just left?"
"LANE: I mean I waited until she went to bed, which was about 9:15, and then I left."
"RORY: You didn't leave a note?"
"LANE: No."
"RORY: You didn't call?"
"LANE: I don't even think I locked the door behind me."
"RORY: Lane, this is bad."
"LANE: I know, but I couldn't miss the gig, Rory. I mean it was CBGB's! I had to go and she wouldn't let me go. [Rory gets up and goes into her room.] Where are you going?"
"RORY: You have to call your mom."
"LANE: No way."
"RORY: [Handing her the phone.] Lane, she could be freaking out right now."
"LANE: I can't tell her. I can't call her."
"RORY: Well, what are you gonna do, just never go home again?"
"LANE: You say that like it's a bad thing."
"RORY: It is a bad thing, a really bad thing!"
"LANE: I can't talk to her."
"RORY: Fine. [Rory dials a number.] Who are you calling?"
"[Lorelai is sleeping and slaps the phone as it rings. She picks it up and hold it to her ear.]"
"LORELAI: I hate you."
"RORY: Mom, are you awake?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Could you be awake?"
"LORELAI: What's the matter?"
"RORY: Lane's here."
"LORELAI: What? Why?"
"RORY: She snuck out of her house tonight, and she's scared to go home."
"LORELAI: She snuck out?"
"RORY: She had something to do with the band."
"LORELAI: Urgh! She snuck out!"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm calling Mrs. Kim."
"RORY: Mom, no."
"LORELAI: Rory, if I woke up and you weren't there, I would have a friggin' heart attack. Now keep Lane there and tell her I am pissed as hell at her. Goodbye. [Hangs up. She dials a new number.]"
"MRS. KIM: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hello, Mrs. Kim, it's Lorelai Gilmore. I am so sorry to be calling so late and, um, I don't know if you know this or not, but Lane isn't there."
"MRS. KIM: [She's at home. There are firemen and a group of people praying in a circle with candles behind her.] Where is she?"
"LORELAI: Well, she went out tonight, and I think she was just scared to tell you about it, but she is fine. She's with Rory at Yale and they're safe and they promise to stay put."
"MRS. KIM: Give me the address!"
"LORELAI: 198 Elm Street, Durfee Hall, suite five. Do you need directions?"
"MRS. KIM: I have a navigational system."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, call me if you need anything. [Mrs. Kim hangs up.]"
"STARS HOLLOW, NIGHT"
"[Mrs. Kim drives in the snow, and stops outside Luke's when she sees him coming outside. Luke has just gotten a shipment of bread from a man. She gets out of her car.]"
"MRS. KIM: Luke!"
"LUKE: Hey, Mrs. Kim. You're up early."
"MRS. KIM: I just want to tell you that Lane will not be coming to work today."
"LUKE: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know."
"MRS. KIM: You know?"
"LUKE: Yeah, she called."
"MRS. KIM: She called?"
"LUKE: Twice. She left a message last night and she called again a minute ago just to make sure I got it. I tell you, that is one responsible kid."
"MRS. KIM: She called you?"
"LUKE: Twice."
"MRS. KIM: She called you, she called Lorelai."
"LUKE: Is everything okay?"
"MRS. KIM: Everything's fine. I'm going home."
"LUKE: Okay."
"[Luke looks after her strangely as she drives home.]"
"YALE"
"[Rory and Lane walk outside in the snow with cups of coffee.]"
"LANE: Let's not stray too far from the coffee cart. I can barely feel my feet this morning."
"RORY: The floor wasn't too comfortable, huh?"
"LANE: No, tit was fine until Paris came home and stepped on my face. The stepping on my face wasn't too comfortable."
"RORY: Well, at least Paris doesn't tend to wear heels."
"LANE: Where was she so late?"
"RORY: I don't know, Paris's business is Paris's business."
"LANE: I wish I lived in a dorm."
"RORY: Hey, have you called your mother yet?"
"LANE: Nope."
"RORY: Oh good, because the longer you wait, the easier it's going to be."
"LANE: I still can't believe she didn't just show up in the middle of the night, kick down the door, douse the place with holy water."
"RORY: Maybe she wanted a chance to cool off."
"LANE: No, that's your mother. My mother's the kicker and the douser. No, Mrs. Kim is sending a message."
"RORY: What message is that?"
"LANE: The message is, ""You messed up, kid, and now you get to sit there and panic about what's gonna happen next, and while you're panicking thinking about what's gonna happen next, you get to find your own way home, cause the Mrs. Kim shuttle van service is closed for business."""
"RORY: So, it's a wordy message."
"LANE: Everything's so screwed up: my life, everything I'm doing."
"RORY: It's not that bad."
"LANE: It is that bad. I mean, look at this. Look at where you are, look at what you have. [Losing her voice.] I'm so jealous you have a life."
"RORY: You have a life too."
"LANE: Yeah, just not a very good one."
"RORY: Lane, come on. You're healthy, you have a band and a boyfriend, and so what if school is boring? You won't be in school forever. You have a good life."
"LANE: I'm weak. I have no spine."
"RORY: [Gently] If you had no spine you'd be walking funny."
"LANE: I wanna thank you for letting me crash here last night."
"RORY: Of course, any time."
"LANE: I gotta get going."
"RORY: Well, hey. Do you want to wait till this afternoon? I can give you a ride home when I'm done with classes."
"LANE: Now. I have to get home. I have to take care of this."
"RORY: Okay, come on."
"LANE: Where are we going?"
"RORY: Well, I can't send you home to Mrs. Kim without a purse full of mini donuts."
"LANE: You know, I believe that's how Mother Theresa got started."
"RORY: Really, I heard it was Pixie Stix."
"YALE CAFETERIA"
"[Rory has just gotten her lunch and is walking to her table. She walks past William.]"
"WILLIAM: Hey, it's Madeline Albright."
"[Rory slams down her tray on a table and walks back to him."
"RORY: You know what? I do not appreciate you calling me that. In fact, I don't appreciate you talking to me, or about me at all."
"WILLIAM: Fine."
"RORY: I know you've been telling the story."
"WILLIAM: What story?"
"RORY: The laundry room story. Remember the laundry room?"
"WILLIAM: Machines, rinse cycle -"
"RORY: I asked you to get coffee, that's it. I did not ask you to get married, or say that I loved you, or ask to have your children. And I'm not stalking you! It was a complete coincidence that I happened to go into a meeting that you happened to be in. I had no idea you were there. And it's hard to ask someone out and it puts you in an incredibly vulnerable position! So, it's cruel to use that incident as a funny cocktail story. So from now on, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from telling the hilarious laundry room incident to anyone, anywhere, ever again. [She picks up her coat and begins to walk off.]"
"WILLIAM: I wasn't talking about you."
"RORY: What?"
"WILLIAM: There was this girl from the third floor, she asked me out like a 100 times. She followed me to class. She baked me a cake every day for a month, then she snuck in my window and hid in my closet, covered in whipped cream."
"RORY: Oh, well - that is a little … extreme."
"WILLIAM: I didn't tell anybody about the laundry room."
"RORY: Well, good. [She turns to leave, but turns back.] Um, do you think that you could maybe not tell anyone this story also, 'cause, that would be great. Thanks. [She leaves.]"
"KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs. Kim walks into Lane's room. She sits down on the bench at the end of Lane's bed. Looking around, she notices that a floorboard is loose. She lifts it up and realizes that there are CDs hidden there. Downstairs, Lane opens the front door of the house and walks upstairs to her room. Mrs. Kim has now found everything in her room, and 'contraband' is scattered everywhere. ]"
"MRS. KIM: Is this all?"
"[Lane walks over and lifts one more floorboard, pulling out a turntable.]"
"LANE: That's all. [Pause] I'm sorry."
"MRS. KIM: About what?"
"LANE: I'm sorry about last night. I don't want to keep secrets from you."
"MRS. KIM: [Gesturing to the room.] You don't?"
"LANE: My band had this amazing chance to play this really famous club last night and I didn't know how to tell you about it. I knew you wouldn't approve, you wouldn't approve of me being in the band or the music we were playing and I can't even imagine what you would have said if I had asked you to let me stay out 'til four in the morning."
"MRS. KIM: I would have said no."
"LANE: Well, then I guess I could have imagined it after all."
"MRS. KIM: How long?"
"LANE: How long what?"
"MRS. KIM: How long … this."
"LANE: I started it when I was six, the day you told me the Cookie Monster was one of the seven deadly sins."
"MRS. KIM: Gluttony."
"LANE: Yes, gluttony."
"MRS. KIM: So, I made you do this?"
"LANE: No, I just - I want to please you so badly, but I can't. I mean, look at you, look at what happened last night. It's not good. I don't want anything like this to ever happen again. I've been thinking a lot about this, our situation, and I think I figured out a way to make everything better."
"MRS. KIM: You have?"
"LANE: I don't want to go to Seventh Day Adventist College anymore. I want to be able to play with my band. I want to be a drummer. [smiling] I will happily go to community college, and I will happily live at home and adhere to your curfew, except on the nights when the band plays or practices. This way, I can get what I want and I won't be lying to you or sneaking around. This way we can both be happy."
"MRS. KIM: Children do not make the rules. You may … move out and live like that somewhere else. [She leaves Lane in her room.]"
"WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Lorelai is on the phone to Rory, who is at Yale.]"
"LORELAI: Well, I think you handled that very well."
"RORY: I was so humiliated."
"LORELAI: You didn't know."
"RORY: How self-centered am I that I just assumed that he was talking about me?"
"LORELAI: Well, I would have assumed the same thing, so, incredibly self-centered."
"RORY: All I know is I can't show my face in International Relations Club again, or the laundry room, or the dining room, or anywhere."
"LORELAI: Well hey, if that nut job who jumped out of his closet Reddi-Whipped is still hanging around, I think you're fine."
"RORY: Hey, it's 4:00."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: Where are the bells?"
"LORELAI: They, uh, stopped."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, they just haven't been working all day."
"RORY: Oh. Too bad."
"LORELAI: Yeah, ain't it though."
"[Someone knocks on the door of the Yale suite.]"
"RORY: Someone's at the door. Call me tomorrow."
"LORELAI: [Half-heartedly] You bet."
"RORY: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, why?"
"RORY: You just sound a little distracted."
"LORELAI: Do I? No, I'm good, I just didn't get much sleep last night, that's all."
"RORY: Okay, see you later."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Rory answers the door. Lane is there with a suitcase.]"
"LANE: Hi."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"LANE: Well, funny you should ask. [Lane rolls her suitcase in the door.]"

"OPEN TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai walks down the sidewalk past people putting up decorations on streetlight for upcoming Firelight Festival. She enters Luke's Diner to find busy lunch hour customers everywhere.]"
"LORELAI: Unbelievable. [she pulls her cell phone from her pocket and hits speed dial]"
"CUT TO RORY'S DORM BEDROOM"
"RORY: Hello?"
"[Scenes change from dorm to diner]"
"LORELAI: There are no empty tables at Luke's."
"RORY'S VOICE: And I can do what about that?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was hoping you'd develop mind control powers since I last saw you and you could will people to leave."
"RORY: No. If I could do that, I'd be using it to play the ponies or something. Your table would be low on the list."
"LORELAI: Selfish! [she looks around and sees Kirk alone at a table] Ooh, hold on a sec. [approaches Kirk] Kirk, may I?"
"KIRK: May you what?"
"LORELAI: Sit with you?"
"KIRK: Here?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"KIRK: I have a girlfriend."
"LORELAI: I'm not flirting with you Kirk."
"KIRK: Oh. Then, have a seat."
"LORELAI: Thanks. [she gazes warmly at him and says breathlessly.] I love that shirt."
"KIRK: It's an Arnold Palmer."
"LORELAI: That was flirting."
"KIRK: Oh, man. [looks uncomfortably around]"
"LORELAI: [returns to her cell phone call with Rory now ignoring Kirk] I'm back. So, what's going on with Lane?"
"RORY: She's here. She's fine. She's uh, still a little bit in denial. She hasn't talked to her mom since the kick-out."
"LORELAI: Poor Mrs. Kim."
"RORY: Poor Mrs. Kim? She kicked Lane out, I'm mad at her."
"LORELAI: Why? She must be very lonely without Lane."
"RORY: Well, Lane's getting along pretty well here. She kind of fallen into a - rhythm. [Lane rushes into the bedroom with travel tray of coffee] Hey."
"LANE: Hey, Take. [she offers coffee tray to Rory]"
"RORY: Thanks you. Hey, you're out of breath."
"LANE: There were incredibly slow people in the coffee line, and I promised to wake Paris. [hurries over to Paris' bed] Up and at 'em!"
"PARIS: Die."
"LANE: I got you a triple espresso that I'm going to put here right out of reach, so sleepyhead has to get up to get it."
"PARIS: Die twice."
"LORELAI: Was she at the professor's again last night?"
"RORY: Yes, but she claims she was up all night cramming."
"LORELAI'S VOICE: Well, she was."
"RORY: Oh, ick!"
"PARIS: [eavesdropping] Ick what? Are you talking about me? Who is that?"
"RORY: It's my mom. We're not talking about you. You're so paranoid."
"LORELAI: Uh, hold on a sec. Luke's here."
"LUKE: [grumpy] I swear, it feels like these stupid Firelight Festivals happen every week."
"LORELAI: And a happy, happy to you too."
"LUKE: Order please."
"LORELAI: Coffee and whatever muffin you have."
"LUKE: Comin' up. You two an item now?"
"KIRK: [indignant] I have a girlfriend."
"LUKE: Double dipping, you dog. [walks away]"
"CUT TO DORM"
"RORY: [loads her book bag while talking] You never told me why you're up so early."
"LORELAI: Well, I've got a quick meeting at the Dragonfly, and then Jason is coming here for the day."
"RORY: [disbelief] Jason?"
"LORELAI: He's taking the morning off, so I'm taking him shopping for new furniture for his office."
"RORY: Sounds fun."
"LORELAI: Yeah. He's never really seen Stars Hollow, so I uh - [quickly hushes as Luke returns to table to fill her coffee cup]"
"RORY: [she finishes Lorelai's sentence]...get to - show him around, right?"
"[Luke pours coffee]"
"LORELAI: Hm. Um-hm."
"LUKE: Did I interrupt something?"
"LORELAI: No."
"LUKE: Would my reminding you of the cell phone policy affect your behavior in anyway?"
"[Lorelai hold up her cell phone to the vicinity of Luke's face]"
"LORELAI: It's Rory."
"LUKE: [he leans closer to the phone] Hello Rory! [to Kirk] How does it feel to be a step-dad?"
"KIRK: [scolding] Knock it off. [Luke walks away]"
"RORY'S VOICE: Gooood thinking."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Clamming up. He's always had a problem with your guys. Best to ease into it."
"LORELAI: Oh. No, no that's not why I stopped talking."
"CUT TO YALE DORM ROOM"
"[Paris is now sitting up in bed taking first gulp of her espresso, Lane standing near by]"
"PARIS: Whoo, whoo! Good Morning Vietnam!"
"CUT BACK TO LUKE'S DINER"
"LORELAI: What was that?"
"RORY'S VOICE: Paris. She likes to do this thing in the morning with the triple espresso. It's like Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider."
"PARIS: [leaps to her feet] Jumping Cattle Hockey!"
"RORY: Hey Paris, can you take this somewhere else, please?"
"LORELAI: Ahh, wait, wait, wait. We got a little something else goin' on here -- [An oddly dressed woman stands at the counter talking animatedly]"
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LORELAI: A kinda odd rock-and-roll, hippy-chick came in, she's deep in conversation with Luke, who is not looking too happy --"
"RORY'S VOICE: What are they saying?"
"LORELAI: Uh, they are rudely out of range. [to Kirk in a sweet voice] Hey hun, hun? Try to move in so you can hear 'em. Go.[motioning him to move closer to Luke]"
"KIRK: [With a nervous chuckle he says to anyone in earshot] She's joking. We're just friends, ha-ha."
"RORY: A mystery woman!"
"LORELAI: Maybe she has something to do with his apartment? I mean he might be leasing out whichever one he's not using, or it's about his divorce with Nicole or the lack of one if the divorce is definitely off."
"RORY: Or maybe she's a friend of Nicole's or another attorney if it's not definitely off."
"[In the background, Lane straightens Paris' bed covers smoothly.]"
"LORELAI: Wait, Luke is the most complicated guy I know who also owns a Doobie Brothers record."
"PARIS: [off camera] Sweet Mamma Jamma!"
"LANE: Oh! I've gotta wake Tanna. [rushes off]"
"LORELAI: Wait, wait… denoument! [whispers into her phone] He sent her upstairs!"
"RORY: Weird!"
"LORELAI: So what do you think? An early morning tryst with the county dominatrix?"
"RORY: [she takes a sip of her coffee] Hmm, does she have a bag?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Then where would all her dominatrix stuff be?"
"LORELAI: Oh, maybe they're using all the stuff he keeps on hand?"
"RORY: Fishing pole?"
"LORELAI: Nolan Ryan's rookie card?"
"RORY: Mystery!"
"LORELAI: Mystery!"
"RORY: Go ask him!"
"PARIS: [off camera] Who's yer daddy!"
"LORELAI: [disappointed] He's in back."
"RORY: So go back there and ask him! I have to know what's going on."
"LORELAI: Okay. [loud crashing noise comes from the storeroom]"
"LUKE: [off camera] Aww, crap, crap crap!"
"LORELAI: Oh, maybe later, I don't think now is such a good time. I'll talk to you later."
"RORY: Later."
"[Lorelai puts her cell phone away and begins pouting and sighing at Kirk. He looks back dumbly. Lorelai winks and begins making loud kissing noises.]"
"KIRK: [looks away immediately] I have a girlfriend!"
"[Lorelai continues to make loud kissing noises much to Kirk's discomfort.]"
"OPEN TO YALE DORM COMMON ROOM"
"[Lane is finishing last touches on Tanna's hair.]"
"LANE: Okay, open your eyes."
"TANNA: [holding up a hand mirror) Wow! I'm stunning."
"LANE: Your stylist concurs."
"[Rory enters from the bedroom looking around the common room.]"
"RORY: Wow, so organized out here."
"LANE: I tidied up a little. Excess stuff went into the cabinet."
"PARIS: [enters] Impressive."
"[phone rings from bedroom]"
"RORY: I'll get it. [exits]"
"TANNA: [to Paris] How good do I look?"
"PARIS: Would a comedic reply crush you?"
"TANNA: [pause] Probably."
"PARIS: Terrif."
"RORY: [from bedroom] Where's the phone?"
"PARIS: Buried somewhere."
"LANE: [proudly] Tanna's gonna knock boys out today."
"PARIS: With what? Sheer peculiarity?"
"TANNA: I am hoping that one boy notices. Chester Fleet."
"LANE: Chester Fleet?"
"TANNA: His father was instrumental in conducting research showing that neurons in the brain fire actively during REM sleep - with the exception of nerve cells involved with the transmitter chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine."
"PARIS: I'd forgot the first part of that sentence by the time you finished, but I say jump him."
"TANNA: [uncomfortable] Thanks Lane. See ya later. [she leaves]"
"RORY: [enters from the bedroom] Finally. [answers the phone] Hello?"
"JAMIE: Hi Rory, its Jamie. How you doin'?"
"RORY: Good Jamie. It's been a while. How's the second best school in the country?"
"JAMIE: Princeton's fine. Hard, not as easy as slacker schools like Yale."
"RORY: I'm assuming you're looking for Paris?"
"JAMIE: Yeah. I'm actually in town for a couple of days, so I'll probably see you at some point."
"RORY: Great. Here she is. [she hands the phone to Paris and prepares to exit.]"
"PARIS: [briskly]Hey, I was just stepping out the door, what's up? [pause] Fine. [pause] Your hotel room's good? [pause] Good. [pause] Well, probably not tonight, unfortunately. Things are really bad on my end. [pause] I know, I'm so sorry but tonight was tentative, remember? Tonight wasn't set in stone. [pause] Well, I'm - dead tired, I have tons of studying to do and we have a little drama going on here at the suite. Rory's small town friend, Lane, is crashing in with us. She got kicked out of her house, and she's in pretty bad shape. She's pretty heavy into the drugs, totally Nancy Spungening it, chasing the dragon, and I kind of have to be here for support. The chick's bouncing off the walls. [pause] Yeah. Tomorrow, sure, absolutely. [pause] Tonight was tentative, Jamie, I'm sure I told you to pencil it in. Pencil. Okay, bye. [Paris clicks off the phone while both Lane and Rory are frowning at her]"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"PARIS: I had to say something like that. He doesn't always respond to the fact that I have to study, which I do, you know that."
"RORY: Oh, sure."
"PARIS: And I'm seeing him tomorrow anyway."
"LANE: What's ""chasing the dragon?"""
"PARIS: I've gotta go [walks off with Lane pursuing]"
"LANE: But I don't think you should be saying that. [far away] it might get around and I don't…"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW WET STREETS"
"[Luke is driving his truck with an annoying tail-gaiter behind him. The black sports car's horn honks, with it's lights flashing - obviously in a hurry]"
"LUKE: Hey, take it easy! [Luke eventually pulls over to curb, and the flashy car roars past. Luke exits his truck.] Jerk!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai is sitting with her purse in lap, waiting. She checks a nearby clock then wanders to her front window and looks out. To her dismay, she sees Jason's black sports car is parked in the driveway with Jason inside.]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE LORELAI'S FRONT DOOR."
"[Lorelai approaches Jason's car with muffled sounds of Japanese voices coming from inside. Jason is on a business conference call via his car's speaker-phone. She softly taps the window glass. Jason lowers the window and motions for quiet from Lorelai. The voices sound increasingly agitated.]"
"JASON: Gentleman, gentlemen. There is no way to one hundred percent avoid liability for on-site accidents at any of your plants. It is unfortunate, but international accords preclude it. Uh, can you please translate Mr. Watanabi?"
"MR. WATANABI VOICE: Okay - [continues in Japanese]"
"JASON: [whispering] I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: What happed to taking the morning off?"
"JASON: I have the morning off. Japan does not have the morning off. Here. [pats the seat next to him] Care to join me?"
"LORELAI: With all those Japanese business men in the car? Kinky."
"MR. WATANABI VOICE: Kinky? I'm sorry, what is kinky?"
"JASON: Uh, y-you don't have to translate that, Mr. Watanabi. Where are we?"
"MR. WATANABI VOICE: They must confer."
"JASON: [under his breath] Oh, they really dig conferring. [normal tone] Please tell them that I will call them again tomorrow. Minna-san domo arigato. Gozaimasu."
"MR. MIDI VOICE: [responds politely in Japanese and disconnects transmission]"
"JASON: Here come on, get in here. It's cold out side."
"LORELAI: I thought we'd take my Jeep. It holds more stuff."
"JASON: That's good thinking. [he gets out of the black Mercedes and gives Lorelai and brief but warm kiss] Hello."
"LORELAI: Hello."
"JASON: So, where are we off today?"
"LORELAI: Well, I've got a fabulous little list here. [she pats her purse] Lots of places in neighboring Woodbury and we'll have to get a newspaper."
"JASON: For --"
"LORELAI: -- finding dead people."
"JASON: Ah, estate sales, got it."
"LORELAI: Then we can come back, hit a few places here and then grab some lunch."
"JASON: Do we have time for coffee now? I haven't had any for hours."
"LORELAI: For hours? When did you get up?"
"JASON: Five."
"LORELAI: Wow, they have one of those in the morning too?"
"JASON: You know how Asia is not taking the morning off? Neither is Europe."
"LORELAI: Well, coffee, it is then."
"JASON: How about you taking me to that place you're always talking about. What is it, um - Duke's."
"LORELAI: [chuckles] Duke's. Sure. Or, uh, we could go some place else."
"JASON: Why? Why not Duke's?"
"LORELAI: It's not so special."
"JASON: You go there daily."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but I think Duke's is closed… and it's Luke's."
"JASON: Closed at eight in the morning on a Friday?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Sabbath."
"JASON: Duke's a Jew."
"LORELAI: No, Luke's a Jew."
"JASON: Sabbath's not 'til sundown."
"LORELAI: Well, he likes to get an early jump on his - Sabbathing."
"JASON: I bet he's open."
"LORELAI: Okay, but we run the risk of going and then discovering it's closed."
"JASON: Well, I say live dangerously or not at all."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Yeah, you're right. All the other coffee in town sucks. Let's just go to Duke's - which is Luke's."
"JASON: Which is Luke's?"
"LORELAI: [grinning] Dukes."
"JASON: What? [Lorelai giggles]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S JEEP IN STARS HOLLOW TRAFFIC"
"[Jason is talking on cell phone while Lorelai drives]"
"JASON: No, no Rietgaard, those documents were Fed-Ex'd to you on Wednesday. Uh, the dok-umen-ten were Fed-Ex'd, on - aw, sh**t, on… Monday is maandag, Tuesday is dinsdag… [to Lorelai] How's your Dutch?"
"LORELAI: Oh great. I just don't like to share it."
"JASON: I'll just have the office fax it all over to you today. It's okay."
"LORELAI: Hey, is he ice-skating under a windmill, that's the picture I have in my head."
"JASON: Okay, Rietgaard, good bye. Bye. [closes cell phone and sighs] I am exhausted."
"LORELAI: Aww, and on your morning off!"
"JASON: Yeah, I stink at taking mornings off."
"LORELAI: Well, here we are. [she pulls up in front of Luke's diner and turns off Jeep]"
"JASON: Ahh, wait.[A pause as he recognizes Luke's green truck across the street]"
"LORELAI: No more calls."
"JASON: Whose truck is that? [pointing] Duke's?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Luke's."
"JASON: Are they different people?"
"LORELAI: Same person."
"JASON: And that's his truck."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's practically an appendage."
"JASON: [Indicating the familiar diner owner through the window] Sooooo, that would be Luke."
"LORELAI: Boy, you sure like to do a lot of research before getting a cup of coffee. That's the doorknob. It twists to the right. C'mon. [starts to remove safety belt]"
"JASON: Ahhh -"
"LORELAI: What is with you?"
"JASON: Yeah, I'm not in the mood for coffee anymore."
"LORELAI: [gasps at the obvious lie] You were jonesing not 5 minutes ago."
"JASON: No, it's passed. My 5 a.m. coffee just kicked in again."
"LORELAI: You drink time-released coffee?"
"JASON: [shrugs] It's all the rage."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, I want coffee. [pulls off safety belt and prepares to get out]"
"JASON: Okay, I'll wait for you here."
"LORELAI: What is with you?"
"JASON: [Pause] I-I was kind of tailgating Duke on the drive in."
"LORELAI: You were tailgating Luke?"
"JASON: Pretty rudely. There was honking."
"LORELAI: Aw, geez."
"JASON: Well, I didn't know it was Duke."
"LORELAI: How fast was he going?"
"JASON: Snail's speed. Like twenty."
"LORELAI: The speed limit here is twelve!"
"JASON: Okay See this is one of the problems I have with small towns - proximity. [During Jason's rant, Luke looks out the window, recognizes Lorelai's jeep out front. Looking closer he sees a man sitting next to her] You tailgate a guy in Manhattan and you never see him again, you tailgate a guy in a small town, he is the keeper of the coffee. [He looks over at the diner window]. And he is looking at us!"
"LORELAI: Who Luke?"
"JASON: Is that his name?"
"LORELAI: YES! [she peers past Jason to see Luke]"
"JASON: Okay, don't look at him! Don't look at him!"
"LORELAI: This is ridiculous!"
"JASON: Okay go, go, go! [motions for her to drive away]"
"LORELAI: Where?!"
"JASON: Anywhere - else - for coffee, please."
"LORELAI: Okay. [starts up the engine and drives 5 feet and stops]"
"JASON: Why are we stopping?"
"LORELAI: Um, the next best place for coffee is at this place. [pointing to the next building]"
"JASON: Okay Please find us coffee at least fifty yards away from Duke's."
"LORELAI: [mocking] Oh, oh okay finding coffee fifty yards from Luke's is another matter. [they drive away]"
"CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA"
"[Rory is taking her lunch tray to a table and almost bumps into Jamie.]"
"JAMIE: Hey Rory."
"RORY: Oh, Jamie, hi."
"JAMIE: Sorry to pounce on you like that."
"RORY: That's okay, you're not pouncing. Wanna sit? [she sets her lunch tray on table]"
"JAMIE: Thanks. [they both sit] Listen, do you - ?"
"RORY: Do I what?"
"JAMIE: Look, I need to find out what's up with Paris, and I don't know who else to ask."
"RORY: Oh."
"JAMIE: I mean, I had to rearrange a million things to come here, and I could only manage two days and she won't see me."
"RORY: Well, you're going to see her tomorrow, aren't you?"
"JAMIE: If she doesn't cancel."
"RORY: She's not going to cancel. [Jamie gives her a doubtful look] She wouldn't."
"JAMIE: Well, she's been canceling plans for weeks. She's not calling me as much - I know, I sound pathetic."
"RORY: No you don't, and Paris has been so busy. You've been a freshman in college, you know what that entails."
"JAMIE: Yeah. [unconvinced]"
"RORY: Plus, I heard her telling you about my friend, Lane. She's been living in our suite and it's been really unfair to all my roommates."
"JAMIE: What is ""chasing the dragon?"""
"RORY: I don't know, but that's what Lane says she's been doing. She's in cold turkey now - going it, I mean - cold turkey and -- um -- Paris has been really great helping out."
"JAMIE: Has she been seeing someone else?"
"RORY: [shrugs] Not that I know of."
"JAMIE: [smiles and rises to go] I'll let you go. Thanks, this actually helped."
"RORY: Good. It will get better, Jamie. I really think that."
"JAMIE: Good. [backs away] It's my birthday."
"RORY: Oh wow, happy birthday."
"JAMIE: Thanks. [Jamie turns and leaves. Rory watches him walk away]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is at the cash register with a departing customer. Kirk is the only person left in the empty diner.]"
"LUKE: [He hands change to the customer who leaves] Thanks. [walks to the opposite end of the counter and rests his head on the cool surface. The mystery woman enters the diner from the back stairs.]"
"WOMAN: Hey!"
"LUKE: [startled] Oh yeah."
"WOMAN: You forget about me?"
"LUKE: No, I'm just real, real busy, that's all."
"WOMAN: [looks around] Looks like a lull to me."
"LUKE: No, it can be deceptive. Hey, Kirk, you want another piece of pie?"
"KIRK: No, I'm fine. And this is the commencement of your classic mid-morning lull. People off to work, kids off to school. You may not have another soul in here for half an hour. It gets peaceful, quiet - kind of like a sweet death."
"WOMAN: [murmurs] He's trippy."
"LUKE: Kirk, are you sure you don't want anything else?"
"KIRK: A spider monkey, but there is probably nothing you can do about it."
"WOMAN: Cool. C'mon. [disappears behind the drape to go back upstairs]"
"LUKE: Coming sis. [slowly follows her]"
"CUT TO LUKE'SAPARTMENTT - OPEN DOOR"
"LUKE: [He enters, closes the door and looks around] Liz? Liz?"
"LIZ: [her call is muffled and off camera] I'm in the closet. Oh my God. It's still here."
"LUKE: What's still there?"
"LIZ: My pot."
"LUKE: Your what?"
"LIZ: I used to stash it in a hole back behind Daddy's files cause it was the one place he wouldn't look. Isn't that wild? It's still here."
"LUKE: [snatches it from her] Will you give me that."
"LIZ: Relax, will ya. I don't do that any more. [Luke stuffs it in a kitchen drawer] What are you doing?"
"LUKE: I'm putting it away."
"LIZ: Throw it in the trash."
"LUKE: So the garbage man can see it?"
"LIZ: Isn't Hayward Donnelly still the garbage man?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LIZ: Well hell, he sold it to me."
"LUKE: I'll get rid of it, okay Liz?"
"LIZ: Okay, Luke. [she smiles at him] Boy, you look good. What about me, don't I look good?"
"LUKE: [looks uncomfortable] You look fine."
"LIZ: I do not look fine, I look good. I am good. I am really good, Luke."
"LUKE: Well, I'm glad."
"LIZ: [indicates the table] I made us some coffee."
"LUKE: I don't drink coffee."
"LIZ: [urges him to sit] Well, sit down and watch me drink it then. Come on, just for a minute. [Luke sits down with Liz and silently watches her pour coffee] Look at us - catching up, and all. I haven't seen you in two years."
"LUKE: Three years."
"LIZ: Three years, wow."
"LUKE: Liz, I gotta know why you're here."
"LIZ: To see you, I've missed you."
"LUKE: C'mon."
"LIZ: I did, plus it's my twentieth high school reunion this Saturday, I thought I'd maybe come back and I'd check out what the rest of the class of 84's up to."
"LUKE: You're going to your high school reunion?"
"LIZ: I even sent in a picture for the program. Wrote a little thing about myself, about how things are going good, I've got a great job, I've just moved into a really cool apartment with a big patio so I can finally get a dog. Plus, I have got -"
"LUKE: Wait, wait, wait - let me guess. A new, a new boyfriend!"
"LIZ: Yes!"
"LUKE: And this one - Oh, let me guess - is different from the others."
"LIZ: Yes, he is."
"LUKE: I dare say, that he might even be the one!"
"LIZ: Well, yeah!"
"LUKE: [he stands and opens the refrigerator] C'mon, Liz."
"LIZ: You should meet him."
"LUKE: Well you know what? As long as, unlike the others, he leaves your TV when he takes off, I'll love him."
"LIZ: Okay, fine. You have good reason to think, to doubt -"
"LUKE: Good reasons? Liz, every time you find the one you wind up with your bank account cleaned out, your stuff missing, crying on the phone to me to bail you out, which I do happily, but you'll understand if I hold off on planning for the bachelor party for a while. [pours orange juice and takes a drink from his glass]"
"LIZ: Sure. Well - anyway - let's talk about something else."
"LUKE: Yes. Let's talk about something else. You said you had a new job."
"LIZ: Yes, I do. I do. I'm making my own jewelry: beaded necklaces and earrings, some crystal, getting into feathers now."
"LUKE: Feathers?"
"LIZ: I'm really good, very big on the renaissance fair circuit."
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LIZ: That's where I sell them, the renaissance fair circuit. It's a total trip. I wear the long skirt, I have a hat and one of those corsets that squishes my boobs all up high. And I yell ""Huzza for the tipper!"""
"LUKE: And that's your great new job? You sell earrings at the renaissance fair?"
"LIZ: I know it sounds flaky -"
"LUKE: Oh no, what - huzzah for the tipper with your squished up boobs, not flaky at all. Look, I have to go back to work."
"LIZ: Luke, come on."
"LUKE: What come on, Liz? I mean, you're selling earrings in a booth and you're hooked up with another winner."
"LIZ: You don't even know him."
"LUKE: What about your son, huh? What about Jess, you talk to him lately? You notice he's not even here?"
"LIZ: Yeah, he sent me a letter. He's with his father."
"LUKE: That's it? That's the extent of the contact?"
"LIZ: He's nineteen, you can't tell him anything."
"LUKE: Well, you definitely can't if you don't try."
"LIZ: I tried."
"LUKE: No, I tried, you gave up."
"LIZ: I thought you'd be better for him that I was."
"LUKE: Oh yeah, I was great for him. I gave him a place to crash while he lied to me about everything, about going to school, about Wal-Mart - you know I stole his car?"
"LIZ: You what?"
"LUKE: In the middle of the night. I break into his car. I'm stealing it and hiding it in Dad's old garage."
"LIZ: [chuckling] Why?"
"LUKE: Why? Because I'm crazy. Because I think now he'll have to go to school, now he'll have to graduate, now - [sigh] well, we saw how that all turned out, he went to live with the bum who abandoned him - that's how great a job I did. [he sighs deeply and takes a gulp of his orange juice]"
"LIZ: You tried."
"LUKE: Well, I'm great at trying aren't I? [deep sigh]"
"LIZ: Well, I know you have a lot of work to do, so I'm gonna go. [she rises and starts to leave]"
"LUKE: Where you staying?"
"LIZ: With Carrie Duncan."
"LUKE: Crazy Carrie Duncan?"
"LIZ: She's not crazy, she just likes the boys."
"LUKE: I'll say."
"LIZ: You should talk. You made out with her at the homecoming game."
"LUKE: I did not. [Liz laughs in disbelief] I didn't not make out with Crazy Carrie Duncan at the homecoming game."
"LIZ: It was really good to see you. And you do look good. [Luke stares at his hands] I will make sure Carrie knows that. [exits]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREET OUTSIDE KIM'S ANTIQUES."
"[Lorelai and Jason pull up in her jeep and get out. Jason is still talking on his cell phone.]"
"JASON: Wait, wait, wait, wait the tracking says its in Atlanta. What is it doing in Atlanta?"
"LORELAI: Who is this country that speaks English?"
"JASON: It's America."
"LORELAI: Everyday she learns something new."
"JASON: Okay, Dennis, it is time to get proactive on this."
"LORELAI: This is when mild mannered Jason Stiles suddenly darted into a phone booth and ripped off his shirt and became - Proactive Man."
"JASON: What? I'm sorry I didn't get that last part."
"LORELAI: Able to be proactive where ever there is activity of a pro nature."
"JASON: Dennis, just do this. A messenger is coming in an hour to pick up the box with the checks -- the box with the checks in the drawer by the floor."
"LORELAI: The vessel with the pestle holds the brew that is true."
"JASON: [stares at her in disbelief and suppresses a chuckle] I'm sorry, I'm kind of distracted."
"LORELAI: [hisses] Get off the phone!"
"JASON: [muffles the phone] It's the last one, I promise - two minutes tops."
"LORELAI: Two minutes and I'm going to throw that thing in the lake."
"JASON: There's a lake?"
"LORELAI: We just drove by the lake."
"JASON: Aw, I missed the lake, can we drive by it again later?"
"LORELAI: Two minutes! [exasperated, she walks away to the entrance of Kim's Antiques]"
"CUT TO THE INSIDE ENTRANCE OF KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lorelai enters and looks around. Mrs. Kim enters with a man following.]"
"MRS. KIM: My deliveryman is very good, very dependable. He will call you with a two hour window. Let me check his availability."
"CUSTOMER: Thank you"
"MRS. KIM: [turns and sees Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mrs. Kim. Hi."
"MRS. KIM: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Wow, you've got a lot of new stuff in here. [She watches as Mrs. Kim searches for paperwork in a nearby drawer, then leans closer to speak quietly.] She's fine. She's at Yale with Rory."
"MRS. KIM: [pulls out schedule book and smiles] Here it is. Let's see, we have Monday between one and three open."
"CUSTOMER: Great."
"CUT TO EXTERIOR OF KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"JASON: [still on cell phone] No, no, no. I don't see any reason why that can't work out."
"LORELAI: [at the entrance - gasps when she sees Jason still on phone] Okay! Ah, I'm sorry but your two minutes are up. Asia, Africa and where ever Jvork is from is just going to have to wait because I'm putting a kibosh on that phone. [Jason waves and gestures wildly to her as she approaches him] I'm sorry mister but I'm clicking that thing off myself."
"JASON: No, no, no. I am still here, Emily! [Lorelai gasps] There's just a lot of commotion around me. No, I'm not in the office. I took the morning off. Yes, Richard deserves a morning off too. Okay, I'll see you at the hotel. Okay, bye. [clicks phone closed and turns to Lorelai] I pulled a muscle waving at you."
"LORELAI: How was I supposed to know you were talking to my mother?"
"JASON: It was a very personal wave. It was a big, broad, over the top personal wave."
"LORELAI: She called you?"
"JASON: She called."
"LORELAI: [Mock serious tone] Are you doing like a Mrs. Robinson thing with my mother?"
"JASON: [return mock serious tone] Yes. I was visiting Richard one day, and he stepped out and Emily lit a cigarette and did that triangle thing with her thigh."
"LORELAI: Well, you said hotel."
"JASON: Well, she wants me to come to some charity thing at a hotel tomorrow. [Lorelai's cell phone rings and moves to answer] Hey, wait, wait a minute. If I can't be on the phone then you cannot be on the phon.."
"LORELAI: [she answers the call] Hello?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE LIVING ROOM AND MOVES BETWEEN STARS HOLLOW AND LIVING ROOM"
"EMILY: Lorelai, its me."
"JASON: Lorelai Gilmore's a hypocrite!"
"LORELAI: Hello Emily!"
"EMILY: Why are you calling me Emily?"
"LORELAI: 'Cause that's your name, ask me again and I tell you the same."
"EMILY: And who was that yelling?"
"LORELAI: No one you'd know. What's up?"
"EMILY VOICE: Well, I'm having trouble filling these eight seats your father bought for the rare manuscript acquisition charity dinner tomorrow night."
"JASON: [answers his ringing phone] This is Jason. Oops. [walks away from Lorelai]"
"EMILY: That's the same man I heard before. Is he harassing you?"
"LORELAI: [slowly walks away from Jason's conversation] Ah, err, yes. I'm on the street. Get away you! It's just insanity out here today."
"EMILY: Well, that's not good. Walk down a different street."
"LORELAI: I'm turning the corner as we speak. So, what, there's a manuscript thing?"
"EMILY: Yes, it's a fund-raiser, and we're stuck and I'm desperate for attendees."
"LORELAI: I'll go. Sure. Yes."
"EMILY: Really?"
"LORELAI: I'll be there. How much - how much do I give?"
"EMILY: Nothing. We've already paid."
"LORELAI: Okay, why don't you leave the details on where to meet up and all on the home machine."
"EMILY: I will, thank you, and please get out of the street."
"LORELAI: I will, bye. [she walks back to where Jason is standing]"
"JASON: Okay, okay, bye. [hangs up] Did she hear me?"
"LORELAI: Yes, but she thinks you're a raving street loon."
"JASON: Okay, this is exactly the reason why I hate hiding relationships"
"LORELAI: I know."
"JASON: We're gonna get caught."
"LORELAI: We can't tell them."
"JASON: We're gonna get caught."
"LORELAI: This is just a freak occurrence."
"JASON: This is destined to be repeated."
"LORELAI: They'll be mad that I hid it."
"JASON: They'll be madder the longer you hide it."
"LORELAI: They'll screw things up, I don't want that. I like us."
"JASON: But, it's inevitable. They're gonna see us together someplace, or a traffic report will take pictures of cars on the expressway and we'll be sitting in the car - and then Richard will be watching the news and he will see us, so barring some sort of Star Trek-like cloaking device - which was problematic in every incarnation of Star Trek - I remember Kirk complaining about it, I remember Picard complaining about it - they will see us, and we'll get caught."
"LORELAI: I'm very uncomfortable dating a Trekkie."
"JASON: Ah, I-I just don't feel good about this. It makes me very nervous. Listen, I've a very difficult phone call this morning with our Japanese partners and I didn't ever break a sweat, I had that testy call from the client from California - not a drop, but your mother calls and I'm soaked through."
"LORELAI: On your morning off too, I'm sorry."
"JASON: That's okay."
"LORELAI: Do you want me to wring your shirt out for you?"
"JASON: No, it's old - and I like us too, by the way which is why I feel so strongly about this."
"LORELAI: I know."
"JASON: I'm not mad."
"LORELAI: I know that too. [guiltily shifts her feet]"
"JASON: And I'll do what ever you want, you know them better than I."
"LORELAI: I'll tell them."
"JASON: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Yes. Tonight's our Friday night dinner. Dad's gone, but starting with Emily might be for the best."
"JASON: I could talk to Richard, if you want."
"LORELAI: Oh no, its my thing. I'll do it."
"JASON: Good. Oh, look phone is off."
"LORELAI: Oh. Good, let's go buy some furniture."

"CUT TO DORM COMMON ROOM"
"[Rory enters and looks around. Paris is sitting by herself with C-Span playing on TV]"
"RORY: So, you're just sitting here watching TV?"
"PARIS: I'm studying. Look at Ted Kennedy, huh? I always admired him as a senator, but you see him and think: It's just so unfair that fat men look good in suits. We girls get a couple of pounds and every piece of fashion betrays…"
"RORY: [clicks off the TV] Off."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: I want to talk to you about your boyfriend situation, Paris."
"PARIS: Jamie?"
"RORY: I'm sorry, I should have clarified ""boyfriends."""
"PARIS: Oh. You mean a certain other fella."
"RORY: Let's cut the coyness. I want to talk about you having an affair with Professor Asher Fleming and at the same time stringing along poor Jamie, with no concern for his feelings."
"PARIS: It's not an affair."
"RORY: Affair. Relationship. Fling. Tete-a-tete. What ever you want to call it."
"PARIS: Well, I'm very surprised by this."
"RORY: How so?"
"PARIS: You've never wanted to discuss Asher before."
"RORY: Well, I don't particularly want to discuss him now, but I'm forced to."
"PARIS: What's forcing you --"
"RORY: I just ran into Jamie, and he's wandering around lonely, missing you, scared of losing you, and you're sitting here watching C-SPAN!"
"PARIS: Nobody watches C-SPAN. It's just on in the background."
"RORY: Well you gotta choose Paris, because this is becoming pretty clear that the what-ever-you-want-to-call-it with the professor is not a short-lived thing."
"PARIS: I'd say that's accurate, and you can just call him Asher."
"RORY: No, he's my teacher, so I think I'll stick with professor."
"PARIS: Professor just makes him sound old."
"RORY: He IS old!"
"PARIS: He's sixty. Today's sixty is what fifty was twenty years ago and he's got the body of a forty year old."
"RORY: I really don't want to talk about his body."
"PARIS: I'm not denying that we've got a May-December romance going on here."
"RORY: This is not May-December, this is May - Ming Dynasty."
"PARIS: An age difference like this is very common. People dating people the same age are passe now."
"RORY: My grandfather introduced you to him. Do you see how awkward this is for me?"
"PARIS: Well, hot men tend to run in packs."
"RORY: Do not ever say anything like that again."
"PARIS: Mary, you are such a prude."
"RORY: Well, at least I'm not mean to people who love me. Where is your heart?"
"PARIS: I know I've mishandled the Jamie situation. He just can't take a hint."
"RORY: Well, you gotta do something, because one of us here does care about Jamie and I think its me."
"PARIS: I know. He's my first real boyfriend."
"RORY: Well, you got lucky with him."
"PARIS: And he's crazy about me, I never quite figured out why."
"RORY: Oh, don't get so self-deprecating. It's obnoxious."
"PARIS: He's been so forgiving. I've been pretty mean. [picks up cordless phone and starts dialing]"
"RORY: Just talk to him and see how it goes."
"PARIS: [into phone] Hey, it's me. We've got to end this - now. [Rory is shocked.] There's just no reason to prolong it. Sorry you came all the way out here. Well, Rory show me the light. She made me see there's just no point in going on."
"RORY: Paris!"
"PARIS: No, she just came home and we talked. She's right here if you want to ask her, yourself."
"RORY: Do not give me that phone!"
"PARIS: Anyhow, I'm really sorry Jamie. Really. Bye."
"RORY: That had all the tact of a n*zi storm trooper."
"PARIS: It was your idea."
"RORY: Breaking up was not my idea."
"PARIS: Well, he'd be stupid if he thought that's why I'd do it. [stands and paces] This was good. It was right. I'm glad I did it. You can have the TV if you want. [exits to bedroom]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW OUTSIDE DAY"
"[Luke helps elderly Mrs. Cassini down the curb as she holds a bag of groceries]"
"MRS. CASSINI: Hello Luke. It's getting cold again isn't it?"
"LUKE: Yup, it's that unpredictable time of year, Mrs. Cassini."
"MRS. CASSINI: Stay warm."
"LUKE: Yeah, you too. [He approaches a small locked garage and searches for the key. He notices the lock has been cut. He opens the swinging doors and sees a large wide empty space inside. He expression changes from shock to disappointment.]"
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER"
"LUKE: [talking on phone] It's a Rambler Ambassador, four door, a rusty brown pretty much a b*at clunker. [pause] No. I don't know how long its been missing. [pause] I mean I saw it for sure last week. Nah, I don't drive it much, it's a second car, okay? [long pause and he sighs] Just, just call me when you find it. Thanks, Bye. [he hangs up]"
"CUT TO DORM BEDROOM"
"[Rory is packing clothes as Paris enters]"
"PARIS: Oh hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"PARIS: Tanna just told me that that Chester Fleet guy liked her hair and asked her out. She's throwing up now."
"RORY: Good for her."
"PARIS: Going somewhere?"
"RORY: Home for the weekend."
"PARIS: Just to get away from me?"
"RORY: No, I've got dinner at my grandma's tonight - obligatory thing - and our town's having its Firelight Festival tomorrow which I haven't missed since I was one, so not seeing you is - Well - quite frankly just a fringe benefit."
"PARIS: Would it make you feel any better to know how awful I feel?"
"RORY: Nope."
"PARIS: I don't understand why you're so upset about this."
"RORY: I know you don't."
"PARIS: I tried to call Jamie again, he won't pick up."
"RORY: Can you blame him?"
"PARIS: No. I know I let it go too long. I just wasn't sure what Asher was thinking at first. I wasn't sure if it was just a fling for him. But over the past couple of weeks, he's been mentioning stuff about the future. He's spending a month teaching a couple of courses at Oxford over the summer and then he asked me what I was planning to do over the summer. I mean there is a definite implication that he was wondering if I was available during the summer. I think he might ask me to go with him to Oxford. I mean, why else would he ask?"
"RORY: b*at me."
"PARIS: I'm not counting my chickens…"
"RORY: Its good thinking."
"PARIS: But it is the first indication."
"RORY: Look, I've gotta hit the road."
"PARIS: It was his accent that did it. I'm such the total Anglophile. When I was a kid, I was in love with Neal Kinnock."
"RORY: Who?"
"PARIS: The former head of the Labour party. Teeth like a horse, but oh that voice, and then there was Roger Moore -"
"RORY: English accents are nice."
"PARIS: He TiVos Frontline."
"RORY: Who does?"
"PARIS: Asher. So we can watch it together."
"RORY: Terrific."
"PARIS: You don't think he meant we'd be together this summer?"
"RORY: I wasn't there."
"PARIS: I'm not counting my chickens."
"RORY: I think that's smart. [starts to leave]"
"PARIS: I never wanted to hurt Jamie. I just don't know how to do these things. I'm not very nice sometimes. I hope Asher doesn't see that in me. [long pause] I didn't mean to hold you up. Have a good weekend."
"RORY: [pauses at the door] I just want you to be happy. You know that, right?"
"PARIS: [smiles for the first time] Thanks. I'm happy."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S INTERIOR FRONT DOOR"
"[Rory enters to hear loud music.]"
"RORY: [calls out over the blare of the music before turning volume down] Mom? Hello?"
"LORELAI: [comes down stairs] Oh, Rory. Good. I did not go suddenly half deaf. Were you supposed to meet me here?"
"RORY: No, I'm a surprise."
"LORELAI: As was your conception."
"RORY: I'll just be two minutes. [exits to go to her room to change]"
"LORELAI: As was your conception."
"RORY: [call off camera] Hey, how was your day with Jason?"
"LORELAI: Fun! He makes me laugh."
"RORY: Aww, I like that"
"LORELAI: [calls out so Rory can hear] He's very off-center. It's been a while since I've been with someone off-center."
"RORY: Cool."
"LORELAI: I'm telling Mom tonight - about us."
"RORY: I think Grandma knows you're my mother."
"LORELAI: About me and Jason."
"[Rory walks into the front hall, putting on her coat.]"
"RORY: Very brave."
"LORELAI: Yeah. [she joins Rory and they walk through the kitchen] Jason's wanted to from the beginning. It's the mature thing to do and that's why I didn't want to do it, but it's time."
"RORY: That's weird [looking in kitchen cabinet]"
"LORELAI: What's weird?"
"RORY: This. [takes out loaf of bread]"
"LORELAI: Bread? Bread is weird?"
"RORY: It's weird when its here. It does not make a good snack."
"LORELAI: It does when you add stuff to it, like cheese."
"RORY: We have cheese? [moves to the refrigerator and opens]"
"LORELAI: Yeah. It's not ""Donner Pass"", we have cheese."
"RORY: Whoa! It's like a frickin' cornucopia."
"LORELAI: Yeah, there's the stuff."
"RORY: There's the cheese!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. Why are you making such a big deal about this?"
"RORY: Because we never had real food in this house the whole time I was growing up."
"LORELAI: What? We always had food. This fridge was never empty."
"RORY: Well, yeah. We had left overs from take-out - cold pizza, Luke's fries, but never stuff you had to assemble."
"LORELAI: Okay chill out on the inquiry. [pushes door closed]"
"RORY: Is that a cucumber?"
"LORELAI: Listen, you'd make a terrible private investigator, because you get hung up on all sorts of dumb stuff that does not matter - now come on. We're late, I'll drive. [leads her out the kitchen door]"
"RORY: Sounds good. [points to the basket on the stove] Oh my God, is that a tomato?"
"LORELAI: Enough already. Let's go."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOUSE - INTERIOR FROM DOOR"
"[Emily opens to greet Lorelai and Rory]"
"EMILY: Ah, my girls are arriving together."
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom."
"RORY: Hi, Grandma."
"EMILY: You smell like coffee. [assists the maid with their coats]"
"RORY: We haven't had any."
"EMILY: It's so strong."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom. I really don't like you sniffing me."
"RORY: Hey where's Grandpa tonight?"
"EMILY: He's in Manhattan having dinner with clients. He just called. They're at some restaurant near Times Square. He said that Times Square just keeps getting cleaner and cleaner. They didn't stumble upon one prostitute the whole night."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. I heard the Disney Company had them all k*ll."
"EMILY: What I don't understand is why Jason wouldn't make this trip instead."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, he's maybe busy with his own thing."
"EMILY: I know for a fact he wasn't. Richard said he took the whole morning off."
"LORELAI: Well, everyone deserves an occasional morning off."
"EMILY: Richard never takes a morning off. He's up every day at five-thirty on the phone then it's out the door to the office. I bet Jason doesn't roll out of bed until eight."
"LORELAI: On the contrary - he - probably gets up earlier than eight. You know, I would think that he would have to, to keep up with Dad."
"RORY: [frowning] Makes sense."
"LORELAI: [uncomfortable] Just a guess."
"EMILY: I just find that boy so irritating. He's always trying to get in good with me. Complimenting me, agreeing with me. He's absolutely prostrating himself at my feet. It's so weak."
"LORELAI: Well you're a formidable opponent, Mom. They don't call you the Edie Amine of the DAR for nothing."
"EMILY: He's so grating about it. I'm never fully comfortable around him."
"LORELAI: Well you should maybe try harder."
"EMILY: I try. But every time I see him a new facet of his Jason-ish comes out."
"LORELAI: It's good to have different facets, and there's probably a lot you don't know about him."
"EMILY: Oh, I'm sure about that. You two would be perfect for each other."
"LORELAI: What? Who, me and Jason?"
"EMILY: A match made in heaven."
"LORELAI: Well, thanks a lot!"
"EMILY: Don't get upset. [rises to go make drinks]"
"LORELAI: Well Mom, you just spent the last five minutes listing every off-putting quality Jason has, real or imagined and then you put me on his level and you say we're perfect together. [Emily begins laughing at the bar table] What's so funny?"
"EMILY: I'm sorry - [continues to laugh]"
"LORELAI: Did I miss something? Did a clown come in behind me and start doing funny pratfalls, what?"
"EMILY: Just the idea of you and Jason together, it's funny."
"LORELAI: [to a grinning Rory] It's funny."
"EMILY: It's really funny. I just said it as a joke."
"LORELAI: You said it as a joke."
"EMILY: You took it so seriously."
"LORELAI: But why is it so funny?"
"EMILY: Well, think about it."
"LORELAI: I am. I just trying to figure out what you're thinking."
"EMILY: Well, it's obvious."
"LORELAI: It's not obvious to me or to Rory. Rory's wondering, aren't you?"
"RORY: Yeah, why is that so funny, Grandma?"
"EMILY: It would just be so ludicrous."
"LORELAI: But why, because he's a - you know, he's a hard-working guy from what I know."
"EMILY: [continues to laugh harder] I'm sorry, you're making me laugh even harder about it. I just said it off hand."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: [offers drink to Lorelai] Martini?"
"LORELAI: You didn't have to shake it much with all that laughing, you know, the laughing just shook it on up for ya."
"EMILY: It's good to laugh like that once in a while."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. I know."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE EXTERIOR FRONT DOOR"
"[Lorelai and Rory exit and walk toward their car. Lorelai appears unusually quiet.]"
"RORY: You okay? [Lorelai doesn't respond] You didn't tell her. Next time? How are your motor k*ll? I'll drive. [She takes the keys from her mother]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Police officer Cooper enters and approaches the counter where Luke is standing]"
"COOPER: Luke."
"LUKE: Oh, Hey Coop."
"COOPER: Good news, found the car."
"LUKE: Oh good. Who would steal that thing. It's just a hunk of junk."
"COOPER: It broke down on the expressway a couple of hours ago, the guy was in it."
"LUKE: You got the guy?"
"COOPER: Yeah, but there's not a lot we can do, the guy's the owner."
"LUKE: What do you mean? I'm the owner."
"COOPER: Well, not according to the registration. It's registered to a --"
"LUKE: Jess Mariano. [watches the tow truck drive by]"
"COOPER: Yep. Says you're his uncle. Registration's long expired, too. It needs seeing to. But I just figured that since these seems like a family matter, I'd bring the car and the kid back to you. [Luke watches Jess step out of the police cruiser.]"
"LUKE: Yeah, a family matter."
"CUT TO A VERY COLD STARS HOLLOW NIGHT - OUTSIDE NEAR THE FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER"
"[Voices are heard off camera while tow truck attendant is lowering Jess' car to the pavement.]"
"COOPER: Where do you want it?"
"LUKE: Right there's fine."
"JESS: This isn't wasn't my idea."
"COOPER: You'll take care of the registration?"
"[camera on Luke and Jess on the sidewalk. Officer Cooper is getting in his squad car.]"
"LUKE: Yeah, thanks Coop."
"JESS: [sarcastic] Yeah, thanks Coop."
"COOPER: [to his partner] Lets go, Frank."
"LUKE: Well, look who's back."
"JESS: I'm only here to retrieve my property."
"LUKE: [crossed arms] You've got a lot of nerve."
"JESS: You've got a lot of nerve."
"LUKE: How so? [squad car drives away as they talk]"
"JESS: You stole my car. Coop should have arrested you, why didn't he arrest you?"
"LUKE: Free donuts."
"JESS: Beautiful."
"LUKE: So you got anything you wanna say?"
"JESS: You could have washed it once in a while?"
"LUKE: Okay fine, the car is yours, our business here is done, hasta la vista, have a nice life. [starts to leave]"
"JESS: Our business here is not done. My car is wrecked because of you."
"LUKE: Oh yeah?"
"JESS: Three of the tires are leaking, its got no oil, the floats in the carburetor are probably cracked so it's back-firing like mad, I mean, people were ducking when I was driving by. Then it stalled and wouldn't start."
"LUKE: Well, you can find Mr. Goodwrench in the Yellow Pages, I think it's under M or is it G? I can never tell with those kinds of things."
"JESS: You're paying for the repairs."
"LUKE: Oh, don't make me laugh."
"JESS: It's broken because of you."
"LUKE: That thing was a piece of junk to begin with, the paint is the only thing holding it together."
"JESS: And the expired registration? I'm gonna have to pay a fine."
"LUKE: So, I guess it didn't work out with your dad, huh?"
"JESS: It worked out fine."
"LUKE: So, what are you doing back East, buddy? Still searching?"
"JESS: Been traveling."
"LUKE: Well, thanks for all the swell cards and letters you sent while you were away."
"JESS: You kicked me out, what were you expecting - a candygram?"
"LUKE: I didn't kick you out, you got yourself kicked out."
"JESS: Nice spin, you should work for Bush."
"LUKE: So what did you get out of this Kerouac trip of yours? You write the great American novel or something? You learn how to play the harmonica?"
"JESS: What do you care, you're not my guardian anymore."
"LUKE: And I bless every day that I'm not."
"JESS: Well, when you're not good at something, it's best to cut and run."
"LUKE: Aww, I'm sorry I tried to give you a decent life, Jess. I'm sorry I didn't think driving a fork-lift for the rest of your life was good enough for you."
"JESS: Oh that is condescending, isn't it? I thought you were a friend of the working man."
"LUKE: Oh, that sister of mine, what a prize. What a prize."
"JESS: What does she have to do with any of this?"
"LUKE: I tell her about the car, she runs and tells you. That's what happened, right? Her claiming she had no contact."
"JESS: Again, the car is mine. Liz was doing the right thing, that's what family does."
"LUKE: Family? What a joke coming from you."
"JESS: Go clean your counters, I'm tired."
"LUKE: So, you staying in town?"
"JESS: I don't know of any twenty-four hour auto shops around here, do you?"
"LUKE: Well, you're not staying with me."
"JESS: It didn't cross my mind."
"LUKE: Get it fixed quick."
"JESS: Believe me, no one wants it fixed faster than me."
"LUKE: You stay away from her while you're here."
"JESS: Stay away from who?"
"LUKE: You know who I mean."
"JESS: Gee, you're so cryptic."
"LUKE: You've done all the damage there you're gonna, okay?"
"JESS: I'm here to get my car, then I'm gone. [walks away from Luke toward his stranded car]"
"LUKE: Where are you staying?"
"JESS: Backseat's as comfy as anywhere."
"LUKE: Fine. [As Jess gets in his chilly car, Luke returns to his diner]"

"LORELAI: It's a free country."
"RORY: Just say hot chocolate or say nothing at all."
"LORELAI: Mmm, terrific ""Ho-Cho""."
"RORY: Oooh, I hate that. It's so cutsey-wootsey."
"LORELAI: Do you hate it as much as my favorite summer treat?"
"RORY: Don't!"
"LORELAI: An ice-cold Fro-Yo! [takes out her cell phone]"

"LORELAI: I'm calling Jason, I promised I would check in. [cell phone rings] Hello."
"CUT TO JASON'S APARTMENT AND BACK TO STARS HOLLOW."
"JASON: I'm dying here, how'd it go?"
"LORELAI: Weeeell, it didn't."
"JASON: [disappointed sigh] Oh."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"JASON's VOICE: You chicken out?"
"LORELAI: Na - it's a long story - the timing was very bad. [Rory stands shivering]"
"JASON'S VOICE: You chickened out."
"LORELAI: No, no. I - ah, yeah - kind of. [Rory and Lorelai continue to walk down the sidewalk]"
"JASON: Lorelai, we've got to do it."
"LORELAI: Well, the timing has to be right"
"JASON: It's going to be awkward no matter when you do it."
"LORELAI: Not if they're both unconscious."
"JASON: Yeah, but then you're going to be dealing with why both your parents are unconscious, and doctors consultations, and phoning friends and relatives - the timing is bad there too."
"LORELAI: Listen, it's ah - trust me, this was not good timing, and I swear to you there'll be much better timing in the near future. [their stroll takes them to the front of Luke's diner where they stop. Rory notices a familiar car parked across the street. She slowly walks toward it.] Well, near is near - I can't define it more than that. Uh, it's closer than far, how's that?"
"RORY: [She stands close enough to see Jess asleep in the backseat.] I don't believe this."
"LORELAI: [concerned] Uh, honey - I gotta call you back, okay? Bye. Um, is that - ?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: I don't believe this."
"LORELAI: What is he doing here?"
"RORY: What is he doing - there? [indicating the car]"
"LORELAI: Asleep in his car - is he living in it?"
"RORY: I don't see stuff."
"LORELAI: Does Luke know he's here?"
"RORY: Well, I know what you know."
"LORELAI: [disbelief] He - may not know."
"RORY: Well, it's right in front of his place. How could he not know?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's freezing out here. He could die, he must not know."
"RORY: Or doesn't care."
"LORELAI: Do you think David Blain put him up to this?"
"RORY: Why is he here? I mean, why did he come back?"
"LORELAI: Light's still on in there, Luke's in there somewhere - should we go talk to him?"
"RORY: [uncomfortable] No. It's too weird. [shivers] And it's - weird."
"LORELAI: Definitely weird."
"RORY: Well, I'll just see you at home. I'm - cause I don't want to deal with this. I'll see you at home. [She quickly walks off, while Lorelai pauses a moment before walking to Luke's diner door.]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER INTERIOR - CLOSED"
"[Lorelai taps on the door's glass window and Luke approaches and opens it.]"
"LUKE: Hey, come on in."
"LORELAI: Are you aware of whose out there?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm aware [continues to stack chairs on tables]"
"LORELAI: That he's sleeping in his car?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: It's about thirty-five degrees."
"LUKE: He's a tough guy, he can take it."
"LORELAI: Luke, why is he back here?"
"LUKE: Because I'm stupid."
"LORELAI: Meaning?"
"LUKE: Well his mom showed up -- for what reason I don't know -- I'm still waiting for that shoe to drop. I mention Jess' car and then - boom - there's Jess."
"LORELAI: So the mystery woman from this morning? That's Liz?"
"LUKE: In all her glory"
"LORELAI: Quite a day you've had."
"LUKE: Oh, it's been delightful. I think Bobby McFerrin's gonna write one of those happy boop-boopdy-doo songs of his about this. I mean, she lied to me about having contact with Jess, so she's lied about everything else."
"LORELAI: But why is he sleeping in his car?"
"LUKE: Because he's going to wait to have it fixed, it's a point of pride with the little punk. But please, don't tell Rory, he'll be gone tomorrow, no reason to upset her."
"LORELAI: Well, she's already seen him."
"LUKE: [grimacing] Oh man!"
"LORELAI: She's fine Luke. She's over it."
"LUKE: Well, he won't go near her, I'll make sure of that."
"LORELAI: Again, I don't think it's necessary. She can fend for herself."
"LUKE: [exasperated] What a lie it all is!"
"LORELAI: All what is?"
"LUKE: Families. I mean, they're just messes. It's like this - spilled drink that just keeps spilling, and ya gotta keep cleaning it up, and you scrub and you scrub and you just can't get the stain up! Show me a happy family - just one. Didn't that Tolstoy-guy say something about families?"
"LORELAI: Probably"
"LUKE: It's a famous thing he said. It's like: ""all families are unhappy"" …or, or, or ""happy on the surface""… or ""unhappy in the same way""…"
"LORELAI: Sounds a little incomplete."
"LUKE: Well, y'know, maybe he couldn't complete the thought because he was dealing with his stinkin' family."
"LORELAI: Do the Hallmark people know about you? 'Cause you're a natural."
"LUKE: (throws his hands up helplessly) I'm tired of cleaning up messes. I'm tired of helping people who do nothing to help themselves!"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry you're so upset. I just don't want you to have to deal with the frozen carcass in the morning"
"LUKE: He'll be fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. Try to get some rest, okay? Relax. Watch a little TV - no family shows…"
"LUKE: (chuckles) Yeah, yeah… I'm going up now."
"LORELAI: Bye. [she leaves and Luke, obviously upset, watches after her]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai enters front door shivering. Rory is studying on the couch.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey. So, do you want an update?"
"RORY: I guess."
"LORELAI: Well, the whole thing - the mystery woman from this morning? Jess' mom."
"RORY: Whoa."
"LORELAI: Still a mystery though. Luke's not quite sure what she's up to."
"RORY: She came with Jess?"
"LORELAI: She called him or something. It's very confusing. Luke was not in an expansive story telling mood. All he knows is that Jess said he came for his car and he's not leaving without it."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Which means he might be here part of the day tomorrow, so uh, ""Danger, Will Robinson."""
"RORY: I can live with it, really."
"LORELAI: That's what I told Luke."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, I'm going to go upstairs, get warm - Good night."
"RORY: Hey, um, before you go."
"LORELAI: Hmm?"
"RORY: What happened to our movie channels?"
"LORELAI: What do you mean?"
"RORY: Well, I was flipping through cable and a bunch of our channels are gone."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, that's not right."
"RORY: And you have bread."
"LORELAI: [chuckles] There's a connection?"
"RORY: Are you skimping?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Cutting back on things, cable, eating out, the bread, the cheese, the tomato"
"LORELAI: Okay, hey - if you're going to try me in a court of law, the bread, the tomato and I will need to hire a lawyer."
"RORY: There's no takeout in the fridge, no takeout containers in the trash."
"LORELAI: You're going through the trash?"
"RORY: And I'm not seeing the stacks of magazines lying around. We always subscribe to everything."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do. I've read them all, they're in recycle bin - you can go check."
"RORY: It even seems a little darker in here - like you're using a lower watt bulb, or something."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, you're reading into everything."
"RORY: You're not having money problems?"
"LORELAI: No. I mean, I'm not going to be on the Fortune 500 list anytime soon, but I'm fine."
"RORY: With the Inn and everything?"
"LORELAI: Yes. We're getting a horse."
"RORY: Cool. And food for the horse?"
"LORELAI: He'll be well fed."
"RORY: Just as long as you're well fed too."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'll call the cable company in the morning. I think we should be getting those channels."
"RORY: Well, you'd tell me, right?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: [closes her study folder and kisses Lorelai's cheek] Well, goodnight."
"LORELAI: Good night angel. [Rory rises and leaves. When she is out of sight, Lorelai clicks off the nearby table lamp.]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER DARK INTERIOR"
"[Luke sighs as he looks out the front window at Jess' parked car. He shrugs and comes to a decision]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW EXTERIOR - STREET"
"[Luke approaches Jess' stranded car and pounds loudly on the window.]"
"JESS: [muffled inside as Luke continues pounding on the glass] Go away. [Eventually Jess impatiently rises and rolls down the window.] What?"
"LUKE: I'm spending the night with Nicole."
"JESS: Thanks for the update."
"LUKE: The hidden key is still in the same place. Now, you can stay out here and freeze to death if you want or you can go inside, I don't really give a damn, it makes no difference to me. [walks off without waiting for an answer]"
"JESS: Fine. [rolls his window up]"
"[Luke gets in his green pickup truck and drives off around a corner. After a pause, the door of Jess' car opens and he gets out heading straight for the diner. Luke quietly rolls around the block corner to secretly watch Jess' progress. Jess neatly finds the hidden key and enters the diner. Luke sighs and drives off.]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is coming down the stairs into the living room. She is zipping up the extra cardigan she's wearing on top of her pajamas]"
"LORELAI: Cold, cold, cold, cold ! Icy feet, stupid frozen-tundra house! Oh. [She picks up a shawl and wraps herself in it. She sees someone sleeping on the couch, bundled in blankets.]"
"LORELAI: Honey, why are you sleeping in here? Your room is way warmer. [She turns up the thermostat and goes into the kitchen.] Okay, here's the question for today, kids. What the hell are the Eskimos thinking? I mean, yes, the hoods are cute, but it's always cold. Always! Plus you have to eat fish for breakfast and you have to eat whales and then polar bears and penguins and Santa Claus... [Comes back from the kitchen, towards the couch and sits on the sleeping figure] Okay, coffee's on, Pop-Tarts are pop-tarting! If you're just going to lie there, I'm going to have to sit here. I'm going to make myself very comfortable on a nice, warm Rory!"
"[Rory comes out of her room]"
"RORY: Why is it so cold in here?"
"LORELAI: Ahh!"
"RORY: Ahh!"
"[Rory ties the belt of her cardigan and comes near the couch]"
"LORELAI: I thought I was sitting on you!"
"RORY: Oh, really? Good trick..."
"LORELAI: Well, if you are there, then who is this?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: We've got a stranger in our house."
"RORY: Robert Downey, Jr?"
"LORELAI: Or a m*rder."
"RORY: ... who needed to take a nap before committing his crimes?"
"[Lorelai lifts the blankets to see Lane sleeping on the couch.]"
"LORELAI: I think this belongs to you."
"RORY: She must have followed me home from Yale. I told her she could hang out there this weekend."
"LORELAI: But why do that when you can come here and sleep where penguins need a coat?"
"RORY: Yeah, why is it so cold in here?"
"LORELAI: I broke that stupid window trying to lock it last night."
"[They walk to the kitchen.]"
"RORY: Well, get it fixed, woman."
"LORELAI: I left Luke a message just now. He'll do it."
"RORY: Before or after the re-enactment of Alive?"
"LORELAI: Hopefully before."
"RORY: Why don't you call a guy?"
"LORELAI: What guy?"
"RORY: A window fixing guy."
"LORELAI: Ah, Luke always gets mad when I pay someone to do something that he could do for free. And then he lectures me about it every time I see him and it's annoying. ""Oh, you paid him how much to fix the window? What, you couldn't just find someone to steal your purse that day? Hey, while you're at it I've got an idea, why don't you go down to a Versateller and let them charge you five bucks to take your own money out of the bank? Or buy some tickets at Ticketmaster and wind up paying more in service charges than it would cost you to see the band? Oh, here's a great fifty buck mark up on a bottle of wine that it would have cost you ten dollars in the supermarket you're missing!"""
"RORY: Oh my God, Luke is annoying."
"LORELAI: So…"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Just wondering what you're thinking about."
"RORY: I'm thinking about nothing."
"LORELAI: Nothing wouldn't happen to wear a leather jacket and be able to pull off an extremely convincing ""Adrian!"" would it?"
"RORY: No, it wouldn't. You think he froze to death?"
"LORELAI: No, He wasn't sleeping here."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: I'm sure Luke took care of it."
"[Lane walks in.]"
"LANE: Hey, did somebody sit on me just now?"
"LORELAI: No, why?"
"LANE: My hip hurts."
"LORELAI: Oh, getting old..."
"[Lane walks out of the room.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, did anyone ever think that maybe Sylvia Plath wasn't crazy, she was just cold?"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREET"
"[Luke's driving his truck in the middle of a traffic jam. Horns are honking, people are yelling complaints. Luke pulls over, gets out of the truck and walks down the street to find out what's causing the traffic jam.]"
"JESS [in his car]: Come on guys, push harder."
"KIRK [into a walkie-talkie]: We need more stars in the gazebo area. I repeat: We need more stars in the gazebo area. Do you copy? Roger."
"JOE: I'm supposed to say roger, Kirk."
"KIRK: I don't think so. Copy. Roger."
"JOE: Roger means I heard you, Kirk. I was supposed to say roger."
"KIRK: Negative. I am in charge here and I say roger! ROGER."
"JOE: No, you don't."
"WOMAN ON THE WALKIE TALKIE: Just let him say roger, Joe."
"JOE: If he says roger, what the hell am I supposed to say?"
"WOMAN: Who cares?"
"JESS: Get out of the way, Kirk."
"KIRK: Hold on. Roger."
"JESS: This car is not stopping."
"KIRK: I am planning the Firelight Festival. Taylor left me in charge, and I have to make sure everything is perfect."
"JESS: MOVE!"
"KIRK: Roger."
"LUKE [to Jess]: Shouldn't you have a marching band behind you?"
"JESS: Go away."
"LUKE: The Budweiser Clydesdales prancing along, Ann Jillian waving in the back."
"JESS: I've got to get my car to Gypsy so she can fix it and I can leave."
"LUKE: So you decided to push it there."
"JESS: I didn't have a choice."
"MAN IN A CAR: Just push this piece of junk out of my way!"
"JESS: I'm going as fast as I can, jerk!"
"LUKE: Jess, do you at all find this ridiculous?"
"JESS: Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I do find this ridiculous. I find it ridiculous that Gypsy won't walk twenty feet to take a look at my car."
"LUKE: Hire a tow truck."
"JESS: It costs eighty bucks to hire a tow truck. Oh, come on, it's like freakin' Carnivale out here."
"LUKE: I'll give you the eighty bucks."
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: You're blocking the whole street."
"JESS: I don't want your money."
"LUKE: You wanna get out of here, let me pay the eighty bucks."
"MAN PUSHING THE CAR: I'll pitch in ten."
"JESS: Hey, how about more walkie, and less talkie."
"LUKE: You're making a spectacle of yourself."
"JESS: Go home, you won't have to watch."
"LUKE: Fine."
"[CUT TO GYPSY'S GARAGE]"
"JESS: Well?"
"GYPSY: Still looking."
"JESS: What's the matter with it?"
"GYPSY: Still looking."
"JESS: You've been circling around the thing for fifteen minutes. You waiting for it to tell you where it hurts?"
"GYPSY: I've seen dumber things talk."
"JESS: Just tell me what's wrong with the car."
"GYPSY: You need a carburetor."
"JESS: So how long until it's fixed?"
"GYPSY: Not sure."
"JESS: It has to be today. I have to walk out of this half-mile, four-block, freakhole of a medical experiment."
"GYPSY: You are delightful. I'll have you out of here tonight. Go away and come back at closing."
"JESS: Fine."
"GYPSY: And bring a lot of money because I'm going to overcharge you like you've never been overcharged before."
"JESS: I'll bet you say that to all the guys."
"GYPSY: On second thought, maybe I'm closing early tonight."
"JESS: I'm going."
"[Jess turns to leave but stops when he sees couple standing across the street. He can only see the girl's back. She has long straight brown hair like Rory used to.]"
"GYPSY: That's not her."
"JESS: What?"
"GYPSY: She cut her hair."
"JESS: Don't know what you're talking about."
"GYPSY: Okay, my mistake."
"[Jess turns back to look at the couple. The girl turns around. It's not Rory.]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is taping plastic wrap over the hole in the window with pink Barbie doll Band-aids.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, now. Hold it. Oh, okay, how does it look?"
"LANE: Festive and femme."
"LORELAI: Yes, and completely ineffective."
"LANE: Maybe it just needs another layer."
"LORELAI: Yes, of glass."
"RORY: Nice. Something to protect us from freezer burn."
"LORELAI: Come over here and help us."
"RORY: I'm not going to help you Barbie Band-aid our window. I will, however, help you to call one of the many extremely qualified window repairmen that I've circled for you in the phone book."
"LORELAI: Hey, if we fix the window before Luke comes over, he will have his feelings hurt. Do you want that?"
"RORY: Phone book's on the kitchen table."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"RORY: I'm going to take a walk, get a Danish, hit the bookstore, and I'll be back for lunch."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LORELAI: [to Lane] Maybe if we add a layer of tinfoil."
"RORY: Hey, professional window guys are driving by, pointing and laughing. I just thought you should know."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[RORY walks out.]"
"LORELAI: So, listen, I have some errands to run today. Do you need anything?"
"LANE: No, I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll probably be heading down Elm."
"LANE: Well, that's a good street."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is. If there is anything you'd want me to do on Elm, or anyone you wanted me to see, I could..."
"LANE: That's okay. Has she said anything to you?"
"LORELAI: No, but she's wanted to."
"LANE: How can you tell?"
"LORELAI: Let's just say it's a mom thing."
"LANE: Yeah, well..."
"[The phone rings.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, well maybe tomorrow then."
"[Lane nods. Lorelai goes over to pick up the phone.]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"EMILY: It's a complete disaster!"
"LORELAI: My existence?"
"EMILY: Not everything is about you, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry."
"EMILY: The rare manuscripts acquisition fundraiser is tonight and we still haven't filled our table. I'm four people short."
"RICHARD: The Burles are going to visit their daughter in New Hampshire."
"EMILY: Well then they can just go straight to hell, then, can't they?"
"LORELAI: Mom, I already said I'd go."
"EMILY: But we still have a half empty table."
"LORELAI: Well, fewer people to fight over the centerpiece."
"EMILY: Stop it. This is not funny. The last person who didn't fill her table was Loretta Bobbins. Do you remember Loretta Bobbins?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Exactly! Once you do not fill your table, you do not get another table to fill. You are off the list."
"LORELAI: Mom, that's not gonna happen to you."
"EMILY: You said you would come."
"LORELAI: I am coming."
"EMILY: And you're bringing someone."
"LORELAI: I never said I was bringing someone."
"EMILY: Well, I'm telling you to now."
"LORELAI: Mom, it's tonight."
"EMILY: I need you to bring someone, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: But I…"
"EMILY: Loretta Bobbins, Lorelai."
"[Richard walks in the room.]"
"RICHARD: All right, the Dartmores are trying to change Bitty's viewing. They'll call back in a minute."
"EMILY: They owe us, Richard. Remind them that they owe us."
"[Richard gestures soothingly while Emily finishes the conversation with Lorelai.]"
"EMILY: All right. I'll see you tonight at six o'clock sharp and don't wear those pantyhose with the seams up the back. You look like ten cents a dance."
"[Emily hangs up the phone.]"
"EMILY: Richard, I need a gimlet."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINNER"
"[Kirk and Miss Patty walk in and sit at a table.]"
"KIRK: After we light the bonfire, the dancers should come through."
"PATTY: Okay, Kirk."
"KIRK: They'll circle the gazebo. Jazz hands, jazz hands, jazz hands. Then out come the flaming batons."
"PATTY: That sounds good, Kirk."
"KIRK: Are you ignoring me?"
"PATTY: Since you were old enough to walk, Kirk."
"[Over at the counter]"
"LIZ: What do you think?"
"CARRIE: I think it's good."
"LIZ: Is there too much turquoise?"
"CARRIE: Are you kidding? Turquoise is timeless."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LIZ: Oh, hey, Luke. You remember my friend Carrie, right?"
"LUKE: Oh, yeah. Hey, Carrie."
"CARRIE: Hi, Butch, good to see you. Been under any bleachers lately?"
"LUKE: No, I haven't. What is that?"
"LIZ: It's an earring tree."
"LUKE: And what is it for?"
"LIZ: You hang earrings on it."
"LUKE: And what is it doing here?"
"LIZ: I thought I'd put some of my earrings out, you know, and see if I could sell some to the good people of Stars Hollow."
"LUKE: No."
"LIZ: Why?"
"CARRIE: They're cute."
"LUKE: This is a diner. People come here to eat, not shop."
"LIZ: But now they can do both."
"LUKE: Uh-huh. Hey, Liz, can I talk to you for a moment?"
"CARRIE: Hey, Liz, you want me to negotiate with him for you?"
"LUKE: No, she doesn't, Carrie. Thanks for the offer. Liz, please?"
"LIZ: Sure, my brother."
"[They go to the other end of the counter.]"
"LIZ: Why are you so stressed about this?"
"LUKE: Liz, do you remember when you decided to make those ceramic pots?"
"LIZ: Yes."
"LUKE: Without a kiln?"
"LIZ: Yes."
"LUKE: And how did that go?"
"LIZ: Pretty bad."
"LUKE: You were depressed for a month, you cut all your hair, you threw out all your clothes..."
"LIZ: I remember the bad times."
"LUKE: You put those earring out on my counter and nobody buys them…"
"LIZ: They sell great at the fairs."
"LUKE: I'm sure they do, but this is not a renaissance fair. Look around. Everybody here has a life. No one's gonna buy them. Please, just--"
"PATTY: Oh, look at this. Oh, these are so cute! Luke, are you selling these?"
"LIZ: He sure is."
"PATTY: Well, I'll take 'em."
"KIRK: Excuse me, I wanted those."
"PATTY: Turquoise? With your complexion?"
"KIRK: They're for Lulu. She's a sweetheart."
"PATTY: Does she have pierced ears?"
"KIRK: Um, I can check. [Speaks into the walkie-talkie.] Joe, have you ever noticed my girlfriend's lobes?"
"JOE [over walkie-talkie]: What?"
"LUKE: Okay, thank you both for the show of support. It's very kind but you don't have to do this."
"PATTY: Do what?"
"LUKE: Pretend that you like them because Liz made them."
"PATTY: Who's pretending?"
"KIRK: Yeah, they're phat."
"LUKE: They're gonna fall apart."
"LIZ: No they're not."
"LUKE: They're gonna make people's ears green and send them to the hospital."
"LIZ: You cannot design my ad campaign."
"LUKE: Liz!"
"LIZ: You need to nap, Jack. I'm cool, they're cool, everybody's cool."
"PATTY: Stop, Kirk!"
"KIRK: Ouch! She slapped me! Who saw her slap me?"
"LIZ: Okay, relax you two. I can make you whatever you want!"
"CARRIE: I want these ones in fuchsia pink. I want these in purple..."
"CUT TO WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Rory walks in.]"
"RORY: Hi, I'd like a large coffee and a cherry Danish, please."
"[An employee hands her a paper cup. She walks over to the coffee pots and sees Jess sitting at a nearby table. They stare at each other for a few seconds.]"
"JESS: I'm leaving."
"[He grabs his coat and walks out.]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SQUARE"
"[Kirk is talking into the walkie-talkie. Joe is yelling from across the square. ]"
"KIRK: A little farther back. Roger."
"JOE: What?"
"KIRK: It's gotta go back farther. Roger."
"JOE: I can't hear you."
"KIRK: Speak into to your walkie-talkie. Roger."
"JOE: Kirk, what are you saying?"
"KIRK: [into the walkie-talkie.] Speak into your... [Gives up and yells] Speak into your walkie-talkie! Roger!"
"JOE: I lost my walkie-talkie. I told you that."
"KIRK: Well, then it's your own fault! Roger!"
"[Lorelai comes over. She sees Luke's truck about to pull out of its parking space and runs over to it.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke, hey Luke, hold on! Please, I know you owe us nothing but our dead frozen carcasses may someday haunt you in your old age, or not... because… [She sees Liz on the driver's seat.] you don't know who I am. Hi. Sorry. I thought you were Luke."
"LIZ: I should put on some lipstick."
"LORELAI: No, I just saw the truck."
"LIZ: Well, I borrowed the truck."
"LORELAI: Right."
"LIZ: He knows."
"LORELAI: I'm sure he does."
"LIZ: I'm Liz, Luke's sister."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke's sister, yeah, I knew you were here. Hi, I'm Lorelai. So, is Luke in the diner?"
"LIZ: No, he just stepped out for a sec. You need him for something?"
"LORELAI: I just needed to tell him something, I ..."
"LIZ: You want me to give him a message?"
"LORELAI: Sure, yeah, um, tell him Lorelai wanted to gently remind him about the window. I'll be home until five-thirty and tell him I looked cold."
"LIZ: Oh, you're the wife."
"LORELAI: The wife?"
"LIZ: Yeah, I knew he got married, but I hadn't seen the face yet. So, oh wow, it's good to meet you."
"LORELAI: No, no, no. I'm not the wife. I'm the friend and the customer, not the wife."
"LIZ: Oh, sorry. You look like his type, so…"
"LORELAI: No, no, not his type or his wife, just his friend. And his customer."
"LIZ: Well, still good to meet you."
"LORELAI: You too. Luke has told me a lot about you."
"LIZ: Yeah, like what?"
"LORELAI: Oh, like you're his sister…"
"LIZ: He admits it!"
"LORELAI: And that, you know, you're here visiting him, and how happy he is that you're visiting him."
"LIZ: He did not say that."
"LORELAI: I think he did."
"LIZ: He's not probably too thrilled I'm here. I'm kind of pain in his ass."
"LORELAI: Well, aren't we all?"
"LIZ: Yeah, but I'm special. I kinda screw up a lot and then he has to fix it and then we fight and then I screw up again and he fixes it - it's a pattern."
"LORELAI: Well, Luke likes his routine."
"LIZ: He's pretty amazing though. No matter how much I screw up, he just keeps fixing it. I need money, he gives me money. No place to live, Luke finds an apartment. Even my kid when I was having trouble with him -- did you ever meet Jess?"
"LORELAI: Oh yes, I did."
"LIZ: I tell you, he was hell on wheels. I couldn't do a thing with him. I didn't know what to do, so..."
"LORELAI: Luke fixed it?"
"LIZ: He tried. He wasn't entirely successful. I don't know, maybe if I had sent Jess to him a little sooner… Well, anyhow, Luke did what he could. He always does. He's like my hero, you know. Like one of those Greek gods with the golden helmets and the shields and the sandals."
"LORELAI: And the little white toga dresses."
"LIZ: I sound silly."
"LORELAI: No, you don't. Take it from someone who's run to Luke many a time. He's definitely one of the good ones. Maybe THE good one."
"LIZ: Yeah, I miss him. I've even been thinking of moving back here."
"LORELAI: To Stars Hollow?"
"LIZ: Maybe. I've discussed it with my boyfriend. I'm not sure how Luke would like it, but I sure would. Well, I should get going."
"LORELAI: Sure."
"LIZ: Well, it was nice to meet you, friend and customer, not wife."
"LORELAI: Nice to meet you too."
"LIZ: I'll be sure and give him your message."
"LORELAI: Don't forget, human popsicle."
"[Liz drives away.]"
"CUT TO BABETTE'S HOUSE"
"[Babette is pouring drinks for Lorelai and Rory.]"
"BABETTE: Well, I have to tell you this is a real treat having you two girls over, like spur of the moment, I don't know what I did to get so damned lucky."
"LORELAI: Well, we just realized we hadn't seen you very much lately and we thought ""Hey, today is the perfect day to catch up with Babette."""
"RORY: Oh, yeah, the perfect day."
"BABETTE: Well I am tickled pink. Here you go-- hot cocoa."
"RORY: Thanks, Babette."
"LORELAI: Ahh, we don't deserve such treatment."
"BABETTE: Of course you do -- two young hotsy-totsies like yourselves hanging out with an old bird like me. You deserve a lot better. So, you kids going to the Firelight Festival tonight?"
"RORY: You bet."
"LORELAI: We're going to be late though because we have to make a pit stop at one of my mother's charity events."
"BABETTE: Ooh, sounds ritzy."
"LORELAI: Like the cracker."
"BABETTE: Well, the festival should be quite a shindig. Just watching Kirk trying to get those stars hung was worth the price of admission. You know, he insisted on demonstrating the correct way to hang 'em and treed himself. It took the fire department and two cans of tuna to get him down."
"RORY: I hate that I missed that."
"BABETTE: Plus, the whole town is buzzing about Jess coming back. Stupid little pisher, trying to sneak out of town without anyone knowing. This town, what is he kidding? Oh, I'm so sorry, sugar. Here I am, going on and on about Jess."
"RORY: It's fine, Babette. I'm fine."
"LORELAI: She's fine."
"BABETTE: You sure?"
"RORY: Yes. I'm sure."
"LORELAI: She's fine."
"RORY: I saw him."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"BABETTE: Jess?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: When?"
"BABETTE: Where?"
"RORY: Today at Weston's."
"LORELAI: He went into Weston's?"
"BABETTE: That little bastard."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"RORY: I went in, he saw me and he left."
"BABETTE: No!"
"LORELAI: He said nothing?"
"RORY: No, he said something. He said, ""I'm leaving."""
"LORELAI: Way to state the obvious."
"RORY: It was so weird. I mean, he's the one who left town. He's the one who didn't call and now he just gets up and walks out like he's mad."
"LORELAI: What does he have to be mad about?"
"RORY: Exactly! I should be mad. It's my town. I should be the one to walk out in a huff."
"BABETTE: You still stuck on him, honey?"
"RORY: No, I'm not. I just wasn't expecting him to come back, that's all."
"LORELAI: He'll be gone soon."
"RORY: Yeah, I know. He'll be gone soon."
"BABETTE: Oh my God, I forgot the marshmallows!"
"RORY: He'll be gone soon."
"CUT TO STREET OUTSIDE LUKE'S DINER"
"[Kirk is chasing some kids down the street.]"
"KIRK: Mayday! Mayday! The Morrison kids have stolen the bonfire again! I repeat: the kids have stolen the bonfire again!"
"[Luke walks in his diner.]"
"LUKE: Cesar, I'm back. What did you burn? Liz!"
"LIZ: Luke, hi!"
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LIZ: I just needed some things."
"LUKE: Steaks?"
"LIZ: Yeah."
"LUKE: You needed steaks?"
"LIZ: Well, I'm making dinner upstairs and you don't have anything."
"LUKE: Then go to a store."
"LIZ: Oh, come on, a couple of steaks. What's the big deal?"
"LUKE: The big deal is, I run a diner. I sell food, that's how I make my living. It's how I can afford all this."
"LIZ: Oh, you can spare a couple of things."
"LUKE: How do you know what I can spare? That's a whole pie."
"LIZ: It's a peach pie. Nobody eats the peach."
"LUKE: A lot of people eat the peach."
"LIZ: I'll buy a pie tomorrow. Tonight I'm making a feast for my guys."
"LUKE: Your guys? Who are your guys?"
"LIZ: You and T.J."
"LUKE: T. J.?"
"LIZ: Yep, you're really gonna like him. He's upstairs right now waiting for us and he--"
"LUKE: Upstairs in my apartment? You left some guy named T.J. alone in my apartment? Ah, Liz!"
"LIZ: I've been gone twenty seconds."
"LUKE: That's all it takes."
"LIZ: To do what? Steal the singing ""Be Happy"" Bass?"
"LUKE: Hey, that is my singing ""Be Happy"" Bass and it had better still be up there, including the batteries."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APPARTMENT"
"[Luke walks in. T.J. has his back to the door.]"
"T.J.: Hey, I thought I'd make chili. [T.J. turns around and sees Luke.] You are not Liz."
"LUKE: Already smarter than the last guy."
"[Liz walks in with the groceries.]"
"LIZ: Hi, baby. Look what I found downstairs."
"T.J.: You must be Luke."
"LUKE: I think she's talking about the steaks."
"LIZ: I was not talking about the steaks. This is my ""Him."" This is my guy. This is T.J."
"T.J.: Guess what it stands for?"
"LUKE: What?"
"T.J.: T.J. Guess what it stands for?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"T.J.: Just guess."
"LUKE: I can't."
"T.J.: Come on."
"LUKE: Thomas Jefferson?"
"T.J.: No. Thomas Jefferson? Wowl, that's a weird guess."
"LUKE: Okay, you know, I've gotta go back."
"LIZ: Oh no, come on, Cesar's there, sit down."
"T.J.: You want a beer?"
"LUKE: You mean one of my beers out of my fridge? Sure, why not."
"T.J.: Coming right up."
"LIZ: Oh, I'm so excited. My two favorite guys are here with me, drinking, talking…"
"T.J.: And soon, there will be chili."
"[Jess comes in.]"
"JESS: I forgot something."
"LIZ: Oh my God, this is freaky. It's like fate. Jess didn't know we were here. I had no idea that Jess would come by and now look at us together. All the men in my life are drawn here to me. This is positive. This means something. Do you feel it?"
"T.J.: I sure do."
"LIZ: Baby, this is my kid. This is Jess. Jess, this is T.J."
"T.J.: Guess what it stands for."
"JESS: No."
"LIZ: Oh, you'll stay for dinner."
"JESS: I've gotta go check on my car."
"T.J.: Come on, we're making a ton of food. There's beer."
"LUKE: My beer."
"JESS: I'm not hungry."
"LIZ: Oh please, stay for a little while. I think you guys are really gonna get along great."
"[Jess sits down reluctantly.]"
"LIZ: Oh, T.J. is really enjoying Stars Hollow. Aren't you, baby?"
"T.J.: Oh yeah, this place is great. It reminds me of New York."
"JESS: How?"
"T.J.: You know."
"LUKE: Neither one is in space."
"T.J.: No, that's not it."
"LUKE: Of course not."
"T.J.: There's an energy, right?"
"LIZ: There is. I feel it. A very similar energy."
"T.J.: Liz showed me your old house and your school. Like the picture of you in the shorts."
"LIZ: My brother was very big in athletics in his day. And the ladies loved him. Ask Carrie. They went out."
"LUKE: Crazy Carrie and I did not go out."
"LIZ: They just made out."
"LUKE: We did not make out. We did not go out. We did nothing that involved the word out."
"T.J.: I think he's still hung up on her."
"LUKE: A lightening bolt, please."
"JESS: I gotta go."
"LIZ: Oh, okay, but come back after you've checked your car. We'll save you some food. You look good. Handsome."
"T.J.: If I was some girl, I wouldn't kick him out of bed."
"LIZ: Come back, okay?"
"JESS: Okay."
"T.J.: Yeah, if you do, I'll draw your portrait on my Etch-A-Sketch."
"LUKE: Hey, can't miss that."
"JESS: We'll see."
"LUKE: Hey, Jess wait a sec."
"[Luke and Jess go out in the hall. Liz waves goodbye.]"
"LUKE: So, wow."
"JESS: Yep."
"LUKE: Well, if I had to pick anyone in the world for my sister to be with, that guy would definitely be his cab driver."
"JESS: I don't know. He had a certain something."
"LUKE: Yeah, lack of chromosomes."
"JESS: That sounds right."
"LUKE: So, what do we do?"
"JESS: About what?"
"LUKE: About that, them, him."
"JESS: Nothing."
"LUKE: Where are you going?"
"JESS: To check on my car."
"LUKE: But Jess, don't you think that we should discuss this?"
"JESS: Discuss what?"
"LUKE: T.J."
"JESS: I thought we just did."
"LUKE: But we didn't come up with a solution."
"JESS: A solution to what?"
"LUKE: Are we having the same conversation? A solution to him."
"JESS: A solution would have been birth control. Too late, move on."
"LUKE: Jess, we have to do something about this."
"JESS: Like what?"
"LUKE: I don't know. We have to say something."
"JESS: Like what?"
"LUKE: He's a grown man with an Etch-A-Sketch!"
"JESS: So shake him real hard. Maybe he'll disappear."
"LUKE: Oh come on. What, do you like this guy?"
"JESS: Of course I don't like this guy. I don't like any of the guys, but she's gonna do what she's gonna do."
"LUKE: No, I do not accept that. We can go to Liz together. We can tell her--"
"JESS: She does not care what we think. She really doesn't care what I think. I've got nineteen years of proof to back me up."
"LUKE: Yes, she does. You just have to find the right angle with Liz."
"JESS: Can I go please?"
"LUKE: No, you can't go. We have to fix this. I cannot watch her throw her life away again with a loser again."
"JESS: You see, this is your problem. You're going to help people whether they want it or not. You have to fix everything. You have to fix everyone. You think it makes you a good guy, but really, it just makes you a pain in the ass. You make it so that when people fail you, you get to feel like the martyr and they get to feel like not only did they screw up, but they also disappointed you. You interfere and you make everything worse. No one is asking for your help. No one wants your help. Focus on your own life and leave everyone else alone."
"[Jess goes down the stairs.]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREET"
"[Kids have taken the walkie-talkie from Kirk and are passing it around while Kirk tries to catch it.]"
"KIRK: Give it back! Give it back! I mean it! I'm in charge here guys! Come on! Give it back! I need that!"
"[Rory goes in the bookstore.]"
"RORY: Hey, Andrew. Can you track these down for me? They're all out of print."
"ANDREW: You got it."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Rory goes around a shelf to look at the books. Jess is sitting down against the wall reading. When he sees her, he puts the book down, gets up and leaves. Rory sighs.]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai comes in the house]"
"LUKE: Ow! Damn it."
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"[She walks in the living room. Luke is standing at the broken window.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: Oh yeah. Hey."
"LORELAI: How did you get in here?"
"LUKE: You left your bedroom window open."
"LORELAI: My bedroom window is on the second floor. What did you do?"
"LUKE: Well, I promised to fix your window, so I'm here to fix your window."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God, you cut yourself."
"LUKE: Glass was broken."
"LORELAI: Hence the need for fixing. I'm sorry. Are you drunk?"
"LUKE: I am not drunk. I do not get drunk."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"LUKE: I had some beer-beers. More than one. A few. And then I came here and I climbed your tree."
"LORELAI: Well, good thinking."
"LUKE: And then I fell out of your tree."
"LORELAI: Hm, sit down."
"LUKE: I landed flat on my back. I felt like Kirk."
"LORELAI: Hold your hand up in the air."
"LUKE: And then I climbed back up the tree. This time I made it. I got in. Sorry about the lamp."
"LORELAI: You know, Luke, you could have broken your neck."
"LUKE: You know, it would have been all right if I had. I would have fixed it because that's what I do: I fix things. Even when they don't want to be fixed."
"LORELAI: Let me see your hand."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because it is bleeding and I need to look at it. [Luke shows her his hand.] Ew! Gross!"
"LUKE: It's fine, leave it."
"LORELAI: I can't leave it, it's cut."
"LUKE: That's my wrist."
"LORELAI: Ah, sorry."
"LUKE: You're very good at this."
"LORELAI: I don't like blood okay?"
"LUKE: So leave it alone."
"LORELAI: No, I can't leave it. [Lorelai puts a Band-aid on the cut.] Do you want to tell me what happened?"
"LUKE: Nothing."
"[Luke gets up from the couch.]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"LUKE: I'm going to fix the window."
"LORELAI: Forget the window."
"LUKE: I can't forget the window. I made a promise and I'm the reliable guy who helps everybody out whether they like it or not."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Oh, yeah. Nothing I can do about it, just the way I am. It is my big problem. Didn't know it was my big problem until today, but now I know. It is my big problem. [Luke looks at his hand] Got a handful of Barbie."
"LORELAI: Luke, what happened today?"
"LUKE: Today I found out what a big, dumb, idiot guy I am. Just an imposing, judgmental know-it-all who blows around yelling and complaining and screwing up everybody else's life."
"LORELAI: I hardly think you're--"
"LUKE: I'm dumb. Yeah, not like Jess. Jess is smart. You know, he doesn't care about anybody else's life. He just takes care of himself."
"LORELAI: Did you and Jess have a thing?"
"LUKE: He informed me that I am nothing but an unwelcome burden to everyone around me."
"LORELAI: Luke, that's not true."
"LUKE: Yes, it is."
"LORELAI: Luke, stop it. Liz was just saying today how grateful she is to have you as her brother and how much she looks up to you."
"LUKE: You talked to Liz?"
"LORELAI: I thought she was you."
"LUKE: I'm a man."
"LORELAI: Well, she was in your truck."
"LUKE: When I'm in my truck, I'm still a man."
"LORELAI: I couldn't see who was driving, okay? I went over the truck and we met and we started talking."
"LUKE: You shouldn't have talked to Liz."
"LORELAI: She worships you. She said she even wants to move to Stars Hollow so she can be closer to you."
"LUKE: She didn't say that."
"LORELAI: She did say that. Jess is an unhappy kid, Luke. He's angry. He doesn't mean the things he says."
"LUKE: He did me a favor."
"LORELAI: Listen, why don't you hang out here and rest for little while, okay? We'll get you a real bandage."
"LUKE: I like the Barbie ones."
"LORELAI: Yes, honey, but the other kids will b*at you up if they see you with one of those. I'll be right back."
"LUKE: Hm."
""
""

"CUT TO GYPSY'S GARAGE"
"JESS: You sure I can't help you? Can I hand you something? You know, it doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to run."
"GYPSY: Just curious--have you noticed since you started standing there, there's been a lot less of the clinking sounds? And the clinking sounds are the sounds tools make when they fix things."
"JESS: You've been fixing this car for hours."
"GYPSY: And I'm not done, so, back off."
"[Lorelai crosses the street.]"
"LORELAI: Jess!"
"GYPSY: Hey, she sounds mad."
"LORELAI: You've been here less than twenty-four hours and already I wanna k*ll you."
"JESS: What did I do to you?"
"LORELAI: All the crap you said to Luke--"
"JESS: What crap?"
"LORELAI: A man who has done nothing but support you and try to help you."
"JESS: I don't know what you're talking about."
"LORELAI: You do know what I'm talking about. Don't act stupid. Why would you do that? What an incredibly insensitive, mean-spirited--"
"JESS: Oh, drop it. This has nothing to do with Luke. This is about Rory."
"LORELAI: This is not about Rory. This is about Luke. Don't you have an ounce of sensitivity in that thick head of yours or are you so mad at the entire world that you don't care who you hurt?"
"JESS: And I suppose we're still not talking about Rory?"
"LORELAI: Wow, second ""Rory"" in ten seconds. You sure have Rory on the brain. I wonder why that is."
"JESS: You started this!"
"LORELAI: Is that why you came back here? Are you still hung up on her Jess ? Is that why you came back?"
"JESS: No."
"LORELAI: Good. Because she is over you. She has moved on and she is very happy."
"JESS: [to Gypsy] Please hurry up so I can get the hell out of here."
"LORELAI: I second that."
"CUT TO THE CHARITY DINNER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into the room where the charity dinner is being held.]"
"LORELAI: Wow. I wonder where Demi and Ashton are sitting."
"RORY: I think we're late."
"LORELAI: We're not late."
"RORY: Grandma said dinner starts at six."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well that means seven."
"RORY: In what universe?"
"LORELAI: They invite you at six knowing you won't be here until seven so dinner won't start until eight. Actually we're early. Oh, there they are. Hey. Hi Mom. Oh, that's a bad face."
"RORY: Told you we were late."
"EMILY: What is Rory doing here?"
"RORY: Hi, Grandma."
"EMILY: You weren't supposed to bring Rory."
"LORELAI: You're really helping the kid's self-esteem here, Mom."
"EMILY: You don't know one man that would be willing to spend the evening with you?"
"LORELAI: I thought you liked Rory."
"EMILY: We do like Rory but we're short of men."
"LORELAI: Well so am I."
"EMILY: Honestly, Lorelai. It's not your looks that keep them away. Think about that."
"RORY: Excuse me, should I stay, or--?"
"EMILY: Of course you should stay. We can't do anything about that now. Come on, come on..."
"[She leads them to the table.]"
"LORELAI: So on a wigged-out level of one to ten, Mom is at--"
"RORY: Frances Farmer?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RICHARD: Rory, what are you doing here?"
"EMILY: Lorelai couldn't find a man."
"LORELAI: You weren't specific, Mom. You didn't say, ""Bring a man."""
"EMILY: And if I had, you would have been able to find one? Rory, sit over there. Marjorie, Shawna, this is my daughter Lorelai and her daughter Rory. This is Marjorie and Shawna."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Hello."
"[They sit down.]"
"LORELAI: [Whispers to Emily] Who are Marjorie and Shawna?"
"EMILY: [Whispers back] Richard and Jason's secretaries. Dull girls, like two rolling pins sitting across from you, but we were desperate."
"JASON: Hello, Emily, Richard."
"RICHARD: Ah, Jason."
"EMILY: You're late, Jason."
"JASON: I know, I'm sorry but I got hung up talking to Feriman in the lobby."
"RICHARD: Feriman is here?"
"JASON: Yes, and he's three drinks ahead of everybody else."
"RICHARD: Oh, marvelous."
"EMILY: No, don't sit there!"
"JASON: Oh."
"EMILY: Sit next to Lorelai. Rory move over."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"EMILY: You two, pretend you're together."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: Emily, good idea."
"EMILY: Shawna, Marjorie, for God's sake, look like you belong here. [They helplessly try to smile and please her.] Oh yes, that's much better."
"[Rory points at the empty chair besides her.]"
"RORY: So who else is joining us?"
"EMILY: No one. We brought one of Richard's coats to hang over the chair."
"RICHARD: We're saying it's Marjorie's husband."
"EMILY: He's making the rounds and at about eight he'll get sick and have to leave."
"RICHARD: Does everybody understand the story?"
"LORELAI: I think so. But then we'll have to hide his jacket. So I suggest I put it under my dress and pretend to be pregnant, then Jason can pretend to be the doctor, then Rory can dig a tunnel, and --"
"EMILY: I might have known you'd turn this into something ridiculous, Lorelai."
"RORY: Yeah, I wanna be the doctor."
"EMILY: Oh good Lord. And Jason, move closer to Lorelai. And for God's sake, you two, at least act like you like each other."
"[Jason takes Lorelai's hand. Lorelai clears her throat.]"
"JASON: Hey, your mom said."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINNER."
"[Luke is doing paper work at the counter. T.J. walks in.]"
"T.J.: Hey, there you are."
"LUKE: Yes here I am, at my job. Will wonders never cease?"
"T.J.: Major party happening outside."
"LUKE: So I hear."
"T.J.: You gotta see it."
"LUKE: Well, I'm sure you can see enough for the both of us."
"T.J.: Big fire, crazy punch, too. Seriously, man, come on out. You won't believe it."
"LUKE: No, T.J., actually, I will believe it, because, see, I live here, so I've seen this festival, oh let's say, about five thousand times."
"T.J.: Yes, I see your point. Okay, well, Liz and I are taking off right after the festivities, so maybe you can come out and say sayonara."
"LUKE: I'll come out as soon as I can."
"T.J.: Great. How long do you think?"
"LUKE: How long I think what?"
"T.J.: How long do you think you will be doing that?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"T.J.: Looks like you're almost done."
"LUKE: Well I'm not."
"T.J.: The stack is getting pretty small."
"LUKE: Look, I will be out soon, okay?"
"T.J.: Okay. I am going to hold you to that."
"LUKE: I consider myself warned."
"[T.J. leaves]"
"CUT TO CHARITY DINNER"
"SPEAKER: The importance cannot be overstated. Language is humanity's lifeline. That is why I thank each and every one of you for your loyal support of the Ephram Wordus Rare Manuscript Acquisition Foundation. Because without it, we would just be stuck rooting around Nag Hammadi."
"[Audience laughs.]"
"LORELAI: Psst! I don't get it."
"RORY: Me neither."
"LORELAI: You go to Yale."
"RORY: Well, I skipped Obscure Manuscript Humor 101."
"LORELAI: [To Jason] Hey, why was that funny?"
"JASON: No -- no idea."
"LORELAI: You were laughing."
"JASON: Take a poll. No one in this room has any idea what this crazy old man is talking about."
"LORELAI: What a bunch of poseurs."
"SPEAKER: ...hundreds of literary artifacts which might otherwise have been lost."
"JASON: How far do you think we can push this?"
"LORELAI: I'm not sure."
"JASON: Dancing?"
"LORELAI: Possibly."
"JASON: Stroll on the terrace?"
"LORELAI: Passable."
"JASON: Making out in the coat-check room?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's going to be tricky."
"SPEAKER: So, once again, I thank you and I hope you all have a lovely evening."
"[Everyone claps. Richard stands up.]"
"RICHARD: I'm going to go find Feriman."
"EMILY: I have to say hello to Babe Wellington."
"LORELAI: Mom, how much longer do Jason and I have to pretend to be together?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, don't do this to me. Until this evening is over, you are together and I don't want to discuss it again."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"LORELAI: [to Jason] I just secured us the coatroom."
"JASON: Let's go."
"LORELAI: I'm going to make out in the coatroom. Don't eat my chicken."
"RORY: That's going on your tombstone."
"FLOYD STILES: Jason."
"JASON: Oh, hello. I didn't know you'd be here."
"FLOYD: You look well."
"JASON: Thank you. How is business?"
"FLOYD: Very good."
"JASON. I'm pleased to hear."
"FLOYD: How's your golf game?"
"JASON: Well it certainly can't match yours but I'm catching up."
"FLOYD: Well, when you're ready…"
"JASON: I'll give you a call."
"FLOYD: Fine. Good to see you again."
"JASON: Same to you."
"[Floyd walks away from the table.]"
"LORELAI: Well, who was that?"
"JASON: My father."
"RORY: Your father?"
"LORELAI: And you two have met before?"
"JASON: Yes, briefly. I believe there was an Aquaman party involved."
"LORELAI: Oh, man. This business thing must have been really bad for you guys."
"JASON: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I mean, that was so cold. You talked like you barely knew each other."
"JASON: Oh, no, no, we've always been like that."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"JASON: No, actually, asking me about my golf game was actually a little too touchy-feely for me."
"LORELAI: Wow, who would have thought I would ever put my mother next to someone and think, ""warm?"""
"RICHARD: Jason, I just heard your father was here."
"LORELAI: How could you possibly have found that out this quickly?"
"RICHARD: Well, news travels fast here. People talk. So, what did Floyd say?"
"JASON: Well--"
"EMILY: Richard, Floyd was just here."
"LORELAI: We know, Mom, we saw him."
"EMILY: He came by the table? What nerve."
"LORELAI: How dare he talk to his son."
"EMILY: Be quiet, Lorelai."
"RICHARD: If he's here he must have a motive."
"EMILY: That's right. He never cared about rare manuscripts before."
"RICHARD: Hm. He must be trying to get information."
"JASON: Richard, I don't think he had an agenda."
"RICHARD: What was his body language like?"
"LORELAI: Well, he was breathing and standing. I think all signs point to alive."
"RICHARD: What did he ask you about?"
"JASON: He asked me about my golf game."
"RICHARD: Not the business?"
"JASON: No."
"RICHARD: Oh, oh, oh. He's tricky."
"LORELAI: He didn't ask about the business, Dad, okay?"
"RICHARD: I know he didn't ask about the business, Lorelai. That was deliberate."
"LORELAI: So he wanted to know nothing on purpose? The fiend."
"EMILY: Please, stay out of it."
"RICHARD: He is planning something. Jason, I think we should strategize."
"JASON: Richard, I really don't think--"
"RICHARD: I have been doing this a lot longer than you have, my boy. If a man like Floyd Stiles comes over to you and does not ask about the business, you can be sure that something very big is coming."
"JASON: Uh, I guess I have to go. If you'll excuse me, ladies."
"EMILY: Bye. Nobody was believing you two as a couple anyway."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW FIRELIGHT FESTIVAL"
"[The troubadour performs with a band.]"
"KIRK: [into walkie-talkie] This is Bird Dog One to Bird Dog Two. The southwest corner is secure."
"JOE: I'm at the southwest corner, Kirk."
"KIRK: Then where the hell am I?"
"CARRIE: Well, look who finally came out of his cave."
"LUKE: Oh, Carrie. What a coincidence."
"CARRIE: You remember Anna, Jill."
"LUKE: Hello, Anna. Hello, Jill."
"CARRIE: We just came from the reunion so we're a little tipsy."
"LUKE: Ah, well, you know, drink water, and take some aspirin before you go to bed."
"CARRIE: I told them that you're trying to pretend that you don't remember the night."
"LUKE: I don't remember the night."
"JILL: I remember the night."
"ANNA: The whole reunion remembered the night"
"JILL: We all talked about it."
"LUKE: Terrific."
"ANNA: Everybody had a crush on Butch Danes in high school."
"JILL: So serious, so intense."
"CARRIE: So hot in those tiny little shorts."
"LUKE: Okay, I should go find Liz."
"CARRIE: Oh, I'll help you find her."
"LUKE: Oh, no, I don't wanna break up the party."
"ANNA: Oh, well, there's always room for a foursome."
"LUKE: So twenty years later, none of you are married?"
"CARRIE: Oh, no, we're all married."
"ANNA: Oh, there's Liz."
"JILL: They're not gonna run out of punch are they?"
"CARRIE: They never run out of punch."
"LUKE: Oh, okay, well, I should go."
"CARRIE: Wait, we're all going to the Styx/REO Speedwagon/Journey concert next week. We have an extra ticket if you're interested."
"LUKE: Oh, wow. If it was just Styx and REO Speedwagon, I'd be there, but Journey freaks me out. Sorry. Enjoy the festival."
"[Lukes walks away.]"
"T.J. : So there's a line a mile long, the place is going crazy for the earrings."
"LIZ: Oh, come on T.J."
"T.J.: Hey, I'm just telling it how it is. The last fair we went, the line was so long it blocked the fruit-ice stand. And traditionally the fruit-ice people are not the nicest people on the circuit but you block their stand and they really go crazy. They threw lemon rinds. But it didn't matter. Most people stayed and they bought plenty."
"LIZ: Well, people seem to like my stuff."
"T.J.: We're heading to Minnesota next month. Big fair there. And this time we're unveiling the booth."
"PATTY: The booth?"
"LIZ: T.J. just built me the greatest booth. You should see it."
"T.J.: Well, you've gotta have a good booth. It's the first thing people see. Earrings are small. You don't know they're there until you're right up on them, but a booth and a nice sign? A person's standing at the jousting match, they turn around and,""Hey, look at that booth with the nice sign."" They come over, take a look at Lizzie's stuff, and bam, they're hooked."
"PATTY: Well, Luke, nice of you to join us."
"LIZ: Oh hi, Luke, I didn't see you there."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, I heard you were leaving right after the festival, so--"
"LIZ: I'm so glad that you came out."
"PATTY: See you later, Liz."
"[Luke and Liz walk away from the group.]"
"LIZ: Can you believe this thing? It hasn't changed one bit since we were kids."
"LUKE: Yeah, same crazy gathering that Mom would take us to."
"LIZ: And then Dad after she died."
"LUKE: He hated it worse than we did. He only took us 'cause Mom liked it."
"LIZ: Of course, that Founder's Day punch…"
"LUKE: Lethal."
"LIZ: The first time I ever threw up on booze it was Founder's Day punch."
"LUKE: That's a nice story."
"LIZ: Hey, listen, I'm sorry about Jess."
"LUKE: Boy, that statement could encompass a whole myriad of things."
"LIZ: I'm sorry I told you I wasn't in touch with him. It's just been the last six months he started calling and he asked me not to tell you, so I was trying to bond or something. I just mentioned the car to him. I didn't know he'd come back here and try to take it."
"LUKE: It's okay. It's his car and he should have it."
"LIZ: I'm just trying to make things better with us."
"LUKE: You should. It's fine."
"LIZ: I have a feeling about him. I think he's going to be okay. He's kinda like Dad, don't you think?"
"LUKE: Oh, I don't know."
"LIZ: Oh, I do. I think he's like Dad. I want to thank you for everything that you did for him."
"LUKE: Well it never hurts to take a sh*t. At least you know you tried."
"LIZ: Sometimes things take a while before they sink in. It did with me. Sorry, I'm so boring tonight. I only had one cup of punch. Gary switched us over to club soda after that."
"LUKE: You're not boring. Who's Gary?"
"LIZ: That's T.J.'s real name."
"LUKE: T.J.'s real name is Gary?"
"LIZ: Yeah."
"LUKE: Gary?"
"LIZ: Yeah."
"LUKE: How the heck did he get - Never mind. I heard him talking back there, Gary. It sounds like things are going pretty good."
"LIZ: They are. Really good."
"LUKE: Good, good."
"LIZ: Oh, hey, wait. I just made these last night. You can give them to your wife. Or Lorelai. Whoever..."
"[Liz hands Luke a pair of earrings.]"
"LUKE: Thanks."
"LIZ: Well, I'm going get my stuff together. We need to leave soon. Tell Gary I went back to your place."
"LUKE: I'll do that."
"[They hug.]"
"LIZ: See you."
"[Liz walks away.]"
"CUT TO THE STREET"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking to the Firelight Festival.]"
"LORELAI: Gone for the rest of the night. We're stuck with the rolling pins. God! So boring!"
"RORY: I am starving."
"LORELAI: What? The possibly beef and some sort of cream sauce did nothing to curb your appetite?"
"RORY: Do you want to start with burgers or do a cart-to-cart attack?"
"LORELAI: Well, there's two of us. I think we can accomplish both goals."
"RORY: I'm going to get the burgers, you hit the carts."
"LORELAI: I'll meet you by the bonfire."
"RORY: Okay."
"CUT TO THE BONFIRE"
"LUKE: T.J."
"T.J.: Hi, you're here. Cool."
"LUKE: Yeah, so, Liz is back at my place getting your stuff, she just wanted me to tell you."
"T.J.: Okay. Thanks."
"LUKE: So look, I kind of heard you guys talking, and things seem to be going pretty good for Liz which is different, and a nice change, and I know that you guys are thinking about moving here, and I just wanted you to know, it's okay by me."
"T.J.: Okay. I didn't realize we needed your permission."
"LUKE: Oh, no. You don't. Maybe you misunderstood me here. I was just trying to say that I assumed because my sister has a history with guys, you know, that, you know, you were like the others. But, well, you seem like a pretty good guy."
"T.J.: Thanks. You're a dick."
"[T.J. walks away from Luke.]"
"LORELAI: So, I just heard the tail end of that conversation and I'm assuming you haven't changed your name to Richard?"
"LUKE: Long, long story. I'll tell you later, but here's a teaser: the word Etch-A-Sketch comes up."
"LORELAI: I'm hooked."
"LUKE: You're all dressed up."
"LORELAI: Just for you."
"LUKE: You go somewhere?"
"LORELAI: Well, my parents had a charity event and they needed a chair filled and who fills a chair better than I?"
"LUKE: No one comes to mind."
"LORELAI: So, did Jess leave yet?"
"LUKE: I stopped by Gypsy's earlier and she was just about done then, so probably."
"LORELAI: No good-byes?"
"LUKE: No. Liz has a feeling about him, though. She thinks he's gonna be fine."
"LORELAI: He could be."
"LUKE: Yeah. Oh, hey, here."
"[He gives Lorelai the earrings Liz made.]"
"LORELAI: Pretty."
"LUKE: Liz made them yesterday. She wanted you to have them."
"LORELAI: Oh, great. Well, be sure to tell her thanks for me."
"LUKE: I will."
"[They smile at each other and turn towards the fire.]"
"CUT TO GYPSY'S GARAGE"
"[Jess hands money to Gypsy.]"
"JESS: There."
"GYPSY: Thank you for your business. Do not come again."
"JESS: Not likely."
"[Jess gets in his car, finds an envelope with money, and gets out of the car. He stops when he sees Rory standing in line for burgers. They stare at each other for a few seconds.]"
"RORY: I get to leave first!"
"[Rory starts running away.]"
"JESS: Rory, wait! Stop!"
"[He runs after her.]"
"RORY: No, you don't get to walk away!"
"JESS: Hold on!"
"RORY: My town! I leave!"
"JESS: I just wanna--where are you going?"
"RORY: None of your business!"
"JESS: We look like idiots."
"RORY: I don't care!"
"JESS: Stop running!"
"RORY: Stop following!"
"JESS: Oh, come on!"
"RORY: Go away, I'm leaving!"
"JESS: Rory, stop!"
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Because I wanna talk to you."
"RORY: About what? What do you want to talk to me about?"
"JESS: When did you learn to run like that?"
"RORY: You know, I have actually thought about this moment. A lot. What would Jess say to me I ever saw him again? I mean, he just took off, no note, no call, nothing, how could he explain that? And then a year goes by. No word, nothing, so he couldn't possibly have a good excuse for that, right? I have imagined hundreds of different scenarios with a hundred different great last parting lines, and I have to tell you that I am actually very curious to see which way this is going to go."
"JESS: Could we sit down?"
"RORY: No. You wanted to talk, so talk. What do you have to say to me?"
"[Jess pauses a second.]"
"JESS: I love you."
"[Rory stares after him as Jess walks away, gets into his car and drives away.]"

"OPEN ON FRONT GROUNDS OF DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie stand near a woman holding two docile horses.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I love them. [petting the horses' noses]"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, I love them, too. [also petting their noses]"
"LORELAI: With an unbridled passion. Good one, huh?"
"SOOKIE: I love horse humor. [giggles]"
"WOMAN: These guys are the best I've got 'cause they're so sweet."
"LORELAI: Hey, Michel, come on over. Meet our two new employees."
"MICHEL: [standing far away] You know that I do not care for the animal kingdom."
"WOMAN: Do you want me to hold them for you? 'Cause I've got a couple of others interested."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, definitely hold them. [dials number on cell phone]"
"RORY'S VOICEMAIL MESSAGE: It's Rory, Talk please [beep]"
"LORELAI: Hi, Rory, it's me. How's school? You learning stuff? Listen, we have the horses, Desdemona and Cletus, and the first two rides have to be me and you. And hopefully, you're over the time that I took you for the pony ride, and the pony was old and just sort of stopped and laid down, and you sort of rolled off into the ditch. It's really not likely to happen again. I promise. So, call me, call me. [puts phone away as Tom walks by] Hey, Tom, how do you like our new horses?"
"TOM: Very fragrant. Follow me."
"LORELAI: [to horse] He's very busy. Don't judge him too harshly."
"CUT TO INTERIOR OF DRAGONFLY MID-CONSTRUCTION"
"[Tom enters and catches workers standing idle.]"
"TOM: Hey, guys, how's National Goof-off day going? That's what I thought. [Lorelai, Sookie and Michel join Tom] Now, we got downstairs hardware being delivered on Wednesday morning."
"SOOKIE: Yippee. [clapping hands with glee]"
"TOM: Yeah, it excites me too. So, I think it would be exciting to have one of you here to see that it's the right stuff. Otherwise, things would come to a crashing halt."
"LORELAI: Oh boy, I got back to back meetings on Wednesday, and one of them is in Hartford. Sook?"
"SOOKIE: I can be here. Oh no, I can't - Davey has a check up that morning."
"LORELAI: Can you move it?"
"SOOKIE: This doctor's really booked. But I can try."
"LORELAI: That's okay. Michel?"
"MICHEL: I'm at the Tally Rand making the money that keeps me from having to stand at expressway off-ramps selling bags of cherries."
"LORELAI: Okay. Oh well, I guess I can move some things around. I don't…"
"[A phone rings in the background.]"
"LORELAI: What is that?"
"TOM: That's your phone."
"SOOKIE: Who's phone? Our phone?"
"TOM: I installed it this morning. You wanted your phone up and running, right? To take reservations?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, my God. [clapping hands]"
"LORELAI: Our first reservation."
"MICHEL: Quick, quick, answer before they hang up."
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"SOOKIE: Dragonfly, Dragonfly."
"MICHEL: Say Dragonfly Inn."
"LORELAI: I mean, Dragonfly Iinn, hello. [pause] Why, yes! We are taking reservations. Our opening day is May 6th. [pause] May 8th and 9th, okay, great. Let me just check. Let me check. [pause] Okay. [She searches for a scrap of paper to write the information on. Unable to find anything else, she uses a gum wrapper.] You got it, and you're getting our best room. Let me just get your information here. Yes. Okay. And your number? Mm-hmm. 7873. Okay. Got your name. Got your number. Got you down for the 8th and 9th. Thank you, Mr. Turner. See you then. [hangs up] We're up and running."
"SOOKIE: We're up and running!"
"MICHEL: But you wrote it down on a gum wrapper."
"LORELAI: So?"
"MICHEL: It's embarrassing. This is an historical document."
"SOOKIE: Who cares what she wrote it down on?"
"[Lorelai smiles thoughtfully, looking at the gum wrapper.]"
"MICHEL: Big Red wrapper."
"SOOKIE: Juicyfruit would have been better?"
"MICHEL: Well, I'm going to go out and get a value pack for when things really start getting busy around here."
"[Lorelai smiles at the gum wrapper as Sookie and Michel bicker.]"
"CUT TO YALE DORM HALLWAY"
"[Rory is leaving a message on Lorelai's voicemail.]"
"RORY: Mom, it's me, I left you a message at home, too. I love that you got horses. As far as that pony ride when I was a kid, you were forgetting one little tidbit there. That pony did not lie down. He died, okay? He died. And then the owner dragged him away by the back legs. Every time I use glue, I think of him. But I'll watch you ride, how's that? Call me back, bye. [She stops before her dorm door and pulls out keys. Just then, Lane exits the room.]"
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"RORY: I live here."
"LANE: But you have game theory class in fifteen minutes."
"RORY: I just thought I would lie down and rest for a while."
"LANE: I knew it. You were up too late last night. I know I should have told you ""lights out."""
"RORY: I had to finish my paper."
"LANE: Your brain needs sleep."
"RORY: It can sleep when I finish my paper."
"LANE: And then there'll be another paper."
"RORY: Mom -"
"LANE: You know what I mean."
"RORY: You look out for me."
"LANE: It's what I do. Okay, go lay down."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am."
"LANE: And stay off drugs. [Rory enters dorm room]"
"RORY: Whoa, what's that smell?"
"TANNA: It's the smoke from my soldering iron. I love it. I love burning things. I love the hot tip of my soldering iron as it liquefies metal and singes the wires -"
"RORY: Honey, how long you been doing that?"
"TANNA: [checks her watch] Three hours."
"RORY: [She removes the iron from Tanna's hand.] Take a break."
"[Paris enters]"
"PARIS: Oh, good, you're all here, so we can clear this up. I found this lying around, and it must belong to one of you because who else would have clothing here? I ask you. [She holds up a shirt with the name Kleebold across the back.] Anyone? Anyone?"
"JANET: Paris."
"PARIS: Anyone? You know, maybe I misspoke. It may not be a shirt. Anyone lose a car cover? Anyone? Anyone?"
"JANET: Knock it off."
"PARIS: I'm just trying to find a nice way to tell you that your behemoth boyfriend is getting a little too comfortable around here. And I speak for everyone."
"RORY: Leave me out of this."
"TANNA: Me too, please."
"PARIS: I just don't want to walk into our bathroom and find him sitting on the john sh**ting up steroids."
"JANET: He does not take steroids."
"PARIS: You mean that unsightly girth is nature given? He must curse God nightly."
"JANET: Enough!"
"PARIS: And the shirt -- stick a pole in it, and Cirque Du Soleil could start selling tickets."
"RORY: He's big, Paris. She got it."
"PARIS: And why does he have his name written on the back? So it's easy to check when he forgets it? Although if he checks it while he's wearing it, he'd have to look in a mirror, and then he'd probably think his name was Dlobeelk, and get confused all over again."
"JANET: Bitter little woman."
"PARIS: If he's gonna continue being an unwelcome guest in our place, I emphasize the word ""our,"" keep him penned in your room."
"JANET: Jealousy doesn't become you, Paris."
"PARIS: What jealousy?"
"RORY: Break it up, guys."
"JANET: Neither does makeup or a hairstyle."
"PARIS: Can it, Blondie."
"JANET: You drove your own boyfriend away, so you hate that anyone else has one."
"PARIS: Oh please."
"JANET: Yeah, why don't you go sit all alone in your room so you can start getting used to how the rest of your life's gonna be."
"PARIS: I'm not alone."
"JANET: Oh, really? Who do you have besides your poster of Noam Chomsky?"
"PARIS: Who do I have?"
"JANET: Yeah. [Paris begins to speak but falls silent.] That's what I thought. Very sad."
"[Janet exits to her bedroom. Paris stomps off to her own bedroom, followed by Rory.]"
"PARIS: I'm gonna grab Barbie's neck and squeeze until her expandable hair falls out and she's dead, dead, dead."
"RORY: Are you staying in here, because I was gonna close my eyes for a little while. [sits down on bed]"
"PARIS: I should just tell her Asher Fleming's my man so she can compare her circa 1972 Lou Ferrigno with him."
"RORY: Then tell her. Put this to rest."
"PARIS: You know we're keeping it on the down low. It's easier this way. You're the only person that knows."
"RORY: Then you're gonna have to swallow stuff like that and not let it get to you."
"PARIS: He smells. That fat tub of hers smells."
"RORY: Hey, did you keep your notes from when you took Major English Poets?"
"PARIS: I've got them somewhere."
"RORY: Can I borrow them?"
"PARIS: Sure."
"RORY: Great, 'cause that means I can skip a class this week. [lays down] Buys me two hours."
"PARIS: I taught Asher that phrase, ""on the down low."" He called it delightful."
"RORY: It's a delightful phrase. [settles deeper under bed covers]"
"PARIS: You know, maybe it's not Janet's boyfriend I can't be around. Maybe I just can't be around boys, because I have a man."
"RORY: Yes, that's it. Resting now."
"CUT TO LORELAI AND RORY'S LIVING ROOM"
"[The phone ringing rolls over to the answering machine.]"
"LORELAI: [from upstairs] Wait, wait."
"LORELAI'S ANSWERING MACHINE: Hey, I've got nothing cute to say for my message. …Oh, puppies. There, that's cute. Now leave yours."
"RORY: [voice on phone speaker] Hello? Pick up, pick up, pick up."
"LORELI: [from upstairs] Wait, I'm here. Wait."
"RORY: I'm running as we speak to not be late for my first official day as a full-fledged food-hall card swiper. That's right, I'm no longer a trainee. After one and a half hours of rigorous training, I am fully independent and in no need of supervision. Whoops, sorry. Just ran into somebody, and he's down."
"LORELAI: [from upstairs] Wait, hold it. I'm coming."
"RORY: I assume you're very proud of me. Talk to you later."
"LORELAI: [running down stairs] Rory, I'm here. [answering machine clicks] Ohh. Of course, you had to be in a big hurry. [calls Rory back and gets voice mail]"
"RORY'S VOICE MAIL: It's Rory. Talk, please."
"LORELAI: Hi. Yeah, of course I'm proud. Card swiping -- who knew you had it in you? Not I. I'm sorry I can't be there to witness this moment. It's certainly as big a moment as, oh, your first baby step and your first fall on your face, which came back to back. Hopefully, somebody's taking lots of pictures. Call my cell or call me at Jason's. We gotta stop meeting like this, hon. Bye."
"CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA ENTRANCE"
"[Rory sits at card swiping table studying and ignoring nearby students.]"
"GLENN: Hey, Rory, if you're gonna completely ignore me, I might as well go hang out with my ex-girlfriend. Same thing."
"RORY: Oh, sorry, Glenn. [swipes his card through reader]"
"GLENN: Everyone is going to be sorry one day -- everyone. [walks off]"
"RORY: You really gotta stop watching ""Taxi Driver,"" Glenn. [returns to studying - impatient student swipes her own card] Oh, did you want me to -- well, it works for me. [cell phone rings] Hello?"
"CUT BETWEEN STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK AND YALE CAFETERIA"
"[Rory and Dean are on the phone together.]"
"DEAN: Rory, hi, it's Dean."
"RORY: Dean, hi."
"DEAN: Bad time?"
"RORY: No. I just thought you would be my mom, but my mom doesn't speak in a resonant basso profundo."
"DEAN: A what? [grinning]"
"RORY: I'm babbling."
"DEAN: So I wanted to run something by you to see if it was okay."
"RORY: Sure."
"DEAN: You know the contractor, Tom?"
"RORY: Grumpy puss?"
"DEAN: That's him. He's offered me a job working on his crew. It's good pay. It's flexible hours."
"RORY: Excellent."
"DEAN: At the inn. Your mom's inn. Is that okay?"
"RORY: The Dragonfly?"
"DEAN: If it's not okay, I won't do it."
"RORY: Why wouldn't it be okay?"
"DEAN: Well, it would occasionally put you and me around each other, and I didn't know how awkward that would be."
"RORY: No. Dean, it's fine. It wouldn't be awkward at all."
"DEAN: You're sure?"
"RORY: Tom knows quality when he sees it -- take the job."
"DEAN: Good, I just didn't know where we stood after my wedding and all."
"RORY: Oh."
"DEAN: You guys didn't come."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm so sorry about that."
"DEAN: It was short notice."
"RORY: And we got jammed on some things. But you got our gift?"
"DEAN: Yeah, Lindsay spins a salad in it every night."
"RORY: That's weird, considering we got you a toaster."
"DEAN: No, you didn't. [realizes she's kidding]"
"RORY: I'm joshing ya."
"DEAN: So, I guess I'll take the job."
"RORY: Are you still going to school, too?"
"DEAN: Part time, but everything's good. I've got a five-year plan."
"RORY: Five years. Cool. I've got about the next two and a half hours planned, and then there's just darkness and possibly some dragons."
"DEAN: Hey, I made the plunge. I got my own cellphone."
"RORY: I thought you sounded a little cellphone-y."
"DEAN: Lindsay and her mom got a good deal on a family plan, so I signed up."
"RORY: It was time. You know, I don't even know your number anymore."
"DEAN: I can give you this one."
"RORY: Actually, I can just save it. You are officially part of my phone log."
"DEAN: Good. [pause] Well, I'll let you go, and uh, I'll see you once in awhile."
"RORY: Inevitability."
"DEAN: And you'll have to tell me what that bass thing was that you said."
"RORY: Something to look forward to."
"DEAN: Bye."
"RORY: Bye. [looks up to see long line of students needing their ID cards swiped] Come on. Come on! Step up, step up. Don't be mice."
"CUT TO JASON'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is lying in bed, talking on her cell phone - business, Jason is pacing back and forth also talking on his cell phone - business]"
"LORELAI: No, we did pick a tile for the bedroom suite bathroom. I distinctly remember."
"JASON: Uh-huh. Make it a semicolon before the clause about interest rates and keep reading."
"LORELAI: Eight weeks ago, ten weeks ago?"
"JASON: No, it is okay to end a sentence with a preposition now. I read it in Safire's column."
"LORELAI: I remember the guy, I don't remember the tile. I do remember the color, white."
"JASON: Safire. He came up with nattering nabobs of negativism for Agnew."
"LORELAI: No, I meant the tile was white, but the guy was, too."
"JASON: Agnew was Nixon's vice president. You know we're getting a little off the subject. Can you just please keep reading?"
"LORELAI: Over 200 shades of white? I did not know that."
"JASON: With sincerely yours, et cetera, forge my signature and get it out tonight."
"LORELAI: We'll look at the samples again and that's okay."
"JASON: I'll see you tomorrow, thank you."
"LORELAI: Thank you. All right, bye-bye."
"JASON: Okay, I am done. Uh, round two? [gets in bed]"
"LORELAI: Well, this is very romantic. I mean, I'm over here arguing about tile, and you're over there arguing about William Safire. Whatever happened to the cigarette after sex?"
"JASON: Oh no. Trust me, William Safire is much hotter. [They kiss.]"
"LORELAI: We're the all-business corporate couple."
"JASON: Brought to you by Marriott."
"[A cell phone rings.]"
"LORELAI: I gotta get that."
"JASON: Oh no, no, no, no, no."
"LORELAI: I told Rory to call me here. Hello?"
"EMILY: Well, guess who's demanding we all make an appearance at lunch?"
"LORELAI: Mom!"
"EMILY: Your grandmother is coming back from Palm Beach."
"LORELAI: Uh-huh. [She climbs out of bed and begins dressing.]"
"JASON: What are you doing?"
"EMILY: Your father has to run over to her house to open it up for her, and then she will be coming over here for the evening to berate me and tell me that my couch has some sort of smell."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, that sounds fun."
"EMILY: She wants to have lunch -- sorry, a luncheon -- the day after tomorrow. You, me, your father, and apparently she wants to meet Jason. All we need is that filthy Eminem fellow to make it a perfect afternoon for me."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll try to track him down, Mom, but you know, he might be on tour or something."
"EMILY: Just be here and be on time, and get your hair cut. You looked like the bird lady from Mary Poppins the last time I saw you."
"LORELAI: Well, Mom, I've been very busy lately."
"EMILY: I don't care how busy you've been, Lorelai. If your hair looks a mess, it will be my fault, and I don't need that responsibility right now. I'll see you at noon. [hangs up]"
"[Lorelai gets undressed.]"
"JASON: What are you doing?I"
"LORELAI: I'm getting undressed."
"JASON: You were already undressed."
"LORELAI: Well, my mother called."
"JASON: So?"
"LORELAI: So, I can't talk to my mother naked."
"JASON: How would she know?"
"LORELAI: She'd know. [gets into bed]"
"JASON: Is it like a super power? She can hear naked people?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she can. She can hear sin and depravity and all sorts of lustful things."
"JASON: Boy, do I wish I could get bitten by that radioactive spider. [leans over and kisses her]"
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION SITE"
"[Lorelai talks on a cell phone.]"
"LORELAI: Please, please, please try to work me in. My hair is long and unmanageable, and I need that scalp-massaging thing that Cindy does after she washes my hair. It makes me think I'm in Tahiti."
"SOOKIE: [rushes in excitedly] Hey! They put pipes in the kitchen. We're almost able to run water!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, give me a second here. Is Cindy there -- she's usually able to work me in. I'm not trying to go around you. Cindy and I are old friends."
"SOOKIE: They are beautiful pipes. The pipes are really big!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, the pipes will be there in two minutes?"
"SOOKIE: Sure. [exits]"
"LORELAI: Look, it won't take long. It's an easy cut. I'm very low maintenance. I might not seem like it now, but I'd be a delight to have in the place, and I'll even dry my own hair. I'll bring my own blow dryer, even. Yes? Tomorrow? Yes. Eleven o'clock, I'll be there. Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"DEAN: Hi, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hey, Dean. So you're working here?"
"DEAN: Yeah, I thought maybe Rory would have told you."
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory and I keep missing each other."
"DEAN: Well, I'm here, and your hair looks fine to me."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, you're very kind."
"TOM: Lorelai, can I talk to you and Sookie over here for a minute?"
"LORELAI: See ya."
"DEAN: Bye."
"LORELAI: [beckons] Sook?"
"SOOKIE: Tom, I gotta tell ya, these pipes."
"LORELAI: She's very thrilled about the pipes."
"TOM: Yeah, they're terrific pipes, and you got that fancy sink coming in tomorrow morning."
"SOOKIE: And you told them they can't install it until I see it, right? Because I have very specific sink needs."
"TOM: They won't even leave it without your approval. [hesitates] Can you guys give us a little space here? [nearby workers walk off]"
"LORELAI: You okay, Tom?"
"TOM: This is kind of tricky."
"SOOKIE: What is?"
"TOM: You know I like you two, right?"
"LORELAI: We know that."
"SOOKIE: Sure."
"TOM: I gotta deal with a lot of jerks in my business, yelling at you when it's not your fault, bugging you about budget increases you got no control over. You don't do that."
"LORELAI: Uh-hm."
"TOM: You always smell good, too. That's a plus. So maybe the checks are getting lost in the mail. I'm guessing it's something like that."
"SOOKIE: The checks? What checks? Our checks?"
"TOM: It's just, in the last few weeks, we've been having some cash flow issues. Oh, this is hard."
"SOOKIE: Are we not paying him?"
"LORELAI: I've been wanting to talk to you about that, Tom."
"SOOKIE: [repeating] Are we not paying him?"
"LORELAI: No, no. We're paying him, we're just not paying him the way we should be. It's been an avalanche lately."
"TOM: You got a lot of things happening here. Everything's going at once."
"SOOKIE: [panicking] I feel very antsy right now, like I just ate some dark chocolate and drank an espresso."
"LORELAI: [to Sookie] Okay. Let me talk to Tom for a second, hon. We'll clear it up, really. Go, go. [to Tom] Boy, I'm sorry about this, Tom. It's just been a deluge."
"TOM: It's the home stretch -- that's usually when a deluge hits."
"LORELAI: I was talking to the bank about a line of credit, but they didn't go for it."
"TOM: Banks suck."
"LORELAI: I meant to talk to you sooner."
"TOM: The thing is, if I don't get paid, I can't pay my guys, then they tend to stop showing up."
"LORELAI: So, uh, do you have to shut down?"
"TOM: I can keep it going awhile longer. For the jerks, I'd shut down. You guys, nah."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Thanks, Tom. Now, hug, no hug?"
"TOM: [uncomfortable] I'm kinda dirty. How about if you whistle at me later in front of the guys when I walk by? Drive 'em nuts."
"LORELAI: You got it. [Tom exits. Lorelai approaches Sookie.] Hey. I should have talked to you sooner."
"SOOKIE: Are we dead broke?"
"LORELAI: Getting there."
"SOOKIE: Well, we'll start cutting corners. I mean, I don't need that big, fancy stove from France. We'll skip that."
"LORELAI: No way!"
"SOOKIE: It's too expensive, and I don't want it that much."
"LORELAI: Sookie, you have four pictures in your wallet. One of Jackson, one of the baby, and two of that stove. You're getting that stove. But we could drop the horses."
"SOOKIE: Desi and Cletus, over my dead body."
"LORELAI: Well, the upkeep is astronomical. Maybe if we drop one of the horses."
"SOOKIE: And who's making that choice, Sophie?"
"LORELAI: How about Jackson? Would he be willing to put up anything?"
"SOOKIE: He just bought a bunch of new farm equipment. He's strapped. Are you suddenly on super-fantastic terms with your parents?"
"LORELAI: If by fantastic, you mean are we as close as that one-armed surfer girl and the shark, then yes."
"SOOKIE: Then what about Luke?"
"LORELAI: What about him?"
"SOOKIE: He's offered before."
"LORELAI: Out of pity."
"SOOKIE: We're pretty damn pitiable right now."
"LORELAI: He's our friend."
"SOOKIE: He's more than that. And he's a hermit, so we know he's got money, and if he didn't want to lend it to you, he'd tell you to your face."
"LORELAI: That would be embarrassing."
"SOOKIE: More embarrassing than Tom almost crying because we're not paying him?"
"LORELAI: No, I guess not."
"SOOKIE: I'll put my thinking cap on, you put yours on, and if we come up with someone better, we'll talk. But we'll keep Luke as a last resort."
"LORELAI: Last resort."
"CUT TO YALE DORM ROOM"
"[Lane enters to hear arguing in the common room.]"
"JANET: This is ridiculous, Paris."
"PARIS: He can sit in your room."
"JANET: I'm still getting ready!"
"PARIS: Then he can sit in the hallway!"
"ANDRE: What's your problem?"
"PARIS: I'll tell you my problem, Andre. Last time you sat on our couch, your mesomorphic frame carved a four-foot crater in it. I felt like I was sitting in a bucket."
"JANET: You're so full of it, Paris."
"PARIS: Kids were skateboarding up and down it. Gandalf the Grey is still falling down it. It was a big hole."
"ANDRE: [to Janet] What does mesomorphic mean?"
"PARIS: It means you've got a fat ass, pal."
"JANET: Just ignore her and sit, Klee."
"PARIS: Do not sit Klee."
"JANET: It's my place, too."
"PARIS: Yours, not that brobdingnagian twit."
"JANET: So every friend I bring here has to pass your a**l standards?"
"PARIS: No, he just has to pass through the door without damaging the frame."
"JANET: Oh, forget it. Just come into my room, Klee."
"PARIS: Good!"
"JANET: Got another hot night at the library planned, Paris?"
"PARIS: He's still in here!"
"JANET: There's nothing like the bitterness of the lonely."
"ANDRE: Yeah."
"PARIS: Nice addition, Potsie."
"JANET: Go put on your spinster dress. [exits with Andre]"
"[Paris stomps off to her bedroom and slams the door. Lane quietly enters behind her.]"
"PARIS: I'm moving or she is. One of us has gotta go."
"LANE: I really hate when you guys fight."
"PARIS: Calling me a spinster. I should stick a javelin in her brain."
"LANE: You should tell her about the professor, that would shut her up."
"PARIS: What? What did you say?"
"LANE: Just that she thinks you're not dating, and you are. You are, aren't you? Asher Fleming?"
"[A furious Paris exits, slamming the door.]"
"CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA CARD SWIPING TABLE"
"[Rory is swiping cards and talking on her cell phone.]"
"RORY: So busy-busy. I know you are, too. And I think I'm coming down with swipe wrist. It's like carpal tunnel, only swipier. Call me if you have any suggestions on how to combat this or if you have Jerry Lewis' number, because maybe his next telethon should be for me."
"[Paris storms up to the table.]"
"PARIS: Rory."
"RORY: Oh, geez. Paris, you scared me."
"PARIS: You told. Come here."
"RORY: I'm working."
"PARIS: Swipe 'em yourself, people. [pulls Rory aside]"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: You told Lane about me and Asher?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: That was a secret between you and me. You're the only one I told."
"RORY: I just told Lane."
"PARIS: She was blabbing it around our suite."
"RORY: That doesn't sound like Lane."
"PARIS: She said it to me, so she probably told everyone. Who else did you blab it to?"
"RORY: I didn't blab it. I just told Lane."
"PARIS: That's blabbing."
"RORY: Well, I told her before she had any connection to Yale. She wasn't living here."
"PARIS: She shouldn't be living here."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: She knows too much."
"RORY: What are you going to do, k*ll her?"
"PARIS: You didn't tell anyone else?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Your milk man, your minister?"
"RORY: Just Lane, and I can tell her not to bring it up ever again, especially at Yale, especially in our room."
"PARIS: She shouldn't be here, Rory."
"RORY: It's just temporary."
"PARIS: That suite is crowded enough with the four of us, plus the Jolly Green Giant and everyone else passing through there. She's gotta go."
"RORY: You're just mad about what she said."
"PARIS: Janet and Tanna think so, too."
"RORY: No they don't."
"PARIS: We've talked. It's crowded. Ask them."
"RORY: I will. After my shift."
"PARIS: Look, I know you like having her around, that she brings back memories of those sunshiny Stars Hollow days when the two of you would hold hands, and skip through fields of wildflowers, and sing Carpenter songs, but she doesn't belong here, she belongs there. And do me a favor and stop blabbing."
"CUT TO DORM ROOM SOME TIME LATER"
"[Rory enters. Tanna watches TV while Janet does sit-ups on the floor.]"
"RORY: Hi."
"JANET: [breathless] Hi."
"TANNA: Hello."
"RORY: Hey, Janet? Could you stop sit-upping for a sec?"
"JANET: I'm done. What's up?"
"RORY: Well, Paris --"
"JANET: Ugh, don't talk to me about Paris."
"RORY: Yeah, I know, she said some stupid things."
"JANET: What a tremendous shock."
"RORY: Yeah, and I'm a little mad that she dragged you two into it. [Tanna switches off the TV.]"
"TANNA: What did she drag us into?"
"RORY: Well, she said that you guys weren't happy that Lane is still staying here, which is weird because Lane has been practically invisible. That is, when she's not cleaning the bathroom or picking up out here or bringing us coffee, et cetera, et cetera. And that's not true that you're tired of her being here, is it? That's just Paris?"
"TANNA: Well, it is a little weird."
"RORY: It is?"
"JANET: It's kind of close quarters in here."
"RORY: I know."
"TANNA: She doesn't go here."
"RORY: I know that, too."
"JANET: It's weird"
"RORY: And you guys have all talked about it?"
"JANET: A little -- we thought she'd be gone by now."
"TANNA: I'm not good at confrontations."
"JANET: Personally, I'd vote Paris out over Lane in a b*at, but Paris goes here."
"RORY: I see."
"TANNA: Are you mad?"
"RORY: No, no. Carry on. [exits to her bedroom]"
"CUT TO BEDROOM"
"LANE: Hey, how was work?"
"RORY: Fine, dull."
"LANE: You gonna study some more?"
"RORY: I'm gonna have to."
"LANE: You look very serious."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LANE: Paris talk to you?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LANE: She was very mad."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LANE: I'm out, aren't I? It's okay. It couldn't last forever. It's time."
"RORY: It's not time. Let me talk to them again."
"LANE: No, it's time. I can't be here forever. I don't even go here."
"RORY: The janitor's always here. He doesn't go here."
"LANE: He works here."
"RORY: So get a job here."
"LANE: The jobs here are for the students."
"RORY: The janitor's not a student."
"LANE: You know what I mean."
"RORY: So enroll."
"LANE: Go to Yale?"
"RORY: Or be a janitor. Yale, janitor, in a hundred years, we'll all be dead. It's all the same."
"LANE: No, this hasn't been fair to anyone here. I need to go. I'll go tomorrow morning. [starts packing]"
"RORY: We used to talk about living together. Remember, when we were little?"
"LANE: I know."
"RORY: It was going to be a house made of cheese."
"LANE: We had much debate about that. It was down to chocolate, cheese, or Brillo pads."
"RORY: Why Brillo pads?"
"LANE: I think they just made us laugh."
"RORY: You brought Stars Hollow here."
"LANE: I'll visit. I promise."
"RORY: Good."
"LANE: Maybe one day we'll live in a house made of cheese."
"RORY: I hope so."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HAIR SALON"
"[Lorelai is seated at a shampoo sink having her hair rinsed.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I love shampoo sinks. They're like a hot tub for your head. Hey, listen, Lee Ann, don't tell Cindy, but you're better, much better. Those hands... [cell phone rings] Oh, no. Oh, no, not now."
"LEANNE: Ignore it."
"LORELAI: It could be my daughter. We've been missing each other for days. Sorry. Hello? No, this is she. No, no, Sookie's there. Yes, it was all arranged. Everywhere? You've looked everywhere? In the kitchen near the pipes? She loves those pipes. Did you look there? No, no, don't leave, please. I'll get someone down there to sign for it. Just please don't leave. I know. Ten minutes. Okay. [quickly dials number] Sookie, where are you?"
"SOOKIE and JACKSON'S RECORDED VOICES: Hi, this is Sookie. And Jackson. And Davey. And Davey wants to say hello, too. Go ahead, Davey, say hello. Come on, say hi. Say hi. Oh, he's licking the phone. Don't lick the phone. Little peepers. Little peepers, does the phone taste good?"
"LORELAI: Oh, for God's sake."
"SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S RECORDED VOICES: I think it tastes like candy. Do you want to say it tastes like candy, huh? Oh he waved! Okay, so here comes the beep."
"LORELAI: Shorten it, dq'd it, and call me back. [quickly dials another number - hair dripping]"
"MICHEL: Tally Rand Hotel, may I help you?"
"LORELAI: Micehel, good! Listen, emergency, can you --"
"MICHEL: You are not going to believe this. [whispers] Celine Dion is here. I'm not five feet away from her."
"LORELAI: Cool, Spiffy. Listen, is there any way you could --"
"MICHEL: Oh, my heart is pounding through my chest. She's so beautiful."
"LORELAI: Yeah, she's very pretty. Listen!"
"MICHEL: She's lovelier in person than she is on TV, and so nice."
"LORELAI: I've only heard good things about her. Listen, can you please --"
"MICHEL: And I have a pimple today. Of all the days to have a pimple."
"LORELAI: Michel, listen. Can you get to the inn? It's really important, and Sookie didn't show, and I'm desperate. I can't get away. I've got wet hair."
"MICHEL: She sneezed. I should give her my hanky."
"LORELAI: Forget it. I'll talk to you later. [hangs up] Lee Ann, what can you do for my hair in two minutes? [Lee Ann stares] I figured."

"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE INTERIOR"
"[Loud Knocking]"
"SOOKIE: Coming. [She shuffles sleepily down the hallway to the front door.] Okay, I'm coming. [opens door]"
"LORELAI: You said you were gonna meet the sink guy at the inn."
"SOOKIE: I did?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Sookie, you did. You said you were going to meet him to approve the sink and sign for it?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, Tom could have done that."
"LORELAI: No, Sookie, Tom couldn't have done that because you insisted that you had to approve the sink before it was installed."
"SOOKIE: I did? Oh, I did, didn't I? Oh, sh**t, oh, sh**t, oh, sh**t, oh, sugar foot."
"LORELAI: If there was ever a time to use the real word, this would be it."
"SOOKIE: Well, just call them, have them deliver the sink tomorrow."
"LORELAI: No, no, Sookie, they can't deliver the sink tomorrow."
"SOOKIE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because they already sent it back to Canada."
"SOOKIE: Why would they do that?"
"LORELAI: Because… that's where it's mother is."
"SOOKIE: I'm sorry, I got no sleep last night. Davey cried forever, and I finally got him to sleep, and I must have fallen asleep with him."
"LORELAI: Sookie, I was counting on you. Now they have to reship it back here, which means we have to repay the shipping fee."
"SOOKIE: Why didn't you call Michel?"
"LORELAI: I did. He couldn't come."
"SOOKIE: You want coffee? I am so tired. This is so typical. He's always complaining about not being included, and then he finally gets a chance, and he won't come."
"LORELAI: Sookie, Michel has a job. We're not paying him."
"SOOKIE: I know, but still."
"LORELAI: Sookie -- stop, turn, look. What do you think of my hair?"
"SOOKIE: Too much product?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, for the past six weeks, I have taken every meeting. I have been at the inn round the clock - I haven't had a second for myself - and all I asked for was just one hour to get my hair done, and then two seconds into the shampoo I get a phone call from a guy who sounds like a ""Kids in the Hall"" character telling me I have to get to the inn to okay a sink that I wouldn't know how to okay because I don't know what makes it okay. You know what makes it okay, which is why you said you would be there to say whether or not it was okay."
"SOOKIE: Look, I said I'm sorry I missed the meeting, but I have a baby here."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know, believe me, that's all I've heard about lately."
"SOOKIE: Well, excuse me for procreating."
"LORELAI: We have a business we're trying to launch."
"SOOKIE: I missed a meeting."
"LORELAI: Every meeting."
"SOOKIE: I said I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: I don't need you to be sorry. I need you to be there."
"SOOKIE: What do you want me to do? I have a baby."
"LORELAI: Sookie, we are drowning here. I wasn't supposed to have to do everything by myself. That's why I have a partner."
"SOOKIE: I didn't know I was gonna be pregnant when we decided to open the inn."
"LORELAI: And if you'd known, we wouldn't be partners?"
"SOOKIE: No, I mean… Look, this isn't the stuff I'm supposed to help with, anyhow."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"SOOKIE: The planning, the decision making -- I've never been any good at that. My part comes later, when we open the inn."
"LORELAI: I need you before then."
"SOOKIE: I'm doing the best I can."
"LORELAI: Fine. I have to go. [exits]"
"SOOKIE: [calls after her] What are we gonna do about the sink?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lane enters.]"
"LANE: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Hey, Lane, back in town, huh? [Busily busses table]"
"LANE: Well, yeah, as of today."
"LUKE: You're not staying with Rory anymore, huh?"
"LANE: No, it was kind of time for me to move on, considering, you know, I don't actually go to Yale."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LANE: You need some help?"
"LUKE: Nope, I'm good. [walks back to counter]"
"ED: I've been waiting for ten minutes."
"LUKE: Sorry, not even close to the record."
"LANE: Listen, I was wondering if I could maybe get my job back. I know it was wrong for me to take off like that. I totally left you in the lurch, and I'd be willing to work extra overtime hours for nothing if you'd consider giving me another chance."
"LUKE: Sure."
"LANE: Really? Oh, my God, thank you, Luke. Should I start right now?"
"ED: Yes [waiting impatiently]"
"LUKE: Your shift tonight will be fine."
"LANE: Okay, my shift tonight. I'll be here. [Lorelai enters the diner wearing a baseball cap to cover her hair.] Lorelai. I really, really want to thank you."
"LORELAI: Aww, you're very, very welcome. For what?"
"LANE: For letting me stay with you."
"LORELAI: You're staying with me?"
"LANE: Yes?"
"LORELAI: And I knew this?"
"LANE: Rory told you…"
"LORELAI: Ha, ha, Rory told me, yeah."
"LANE: She did tell you, right? She said she was gonna call."
"[Lorelai quickly checks the messages on cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Ahh, I guess you're staying with me."
"LANE: Is that okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, its okay. Just make sure your mom knows."
"LANE: Okay, I will. I'll see you at home. [exits while speaking] Thanks, Luke, I'll see you later."
"ED: Oh, we'll be here."
"LUKE: Sit down, Ed. [returns to counter] Pigs, gluttons."
"LORELAI: Customers!"
"LUKE: How could people eat this much?"
"LORELAI: Well, this is not all from one person, Luke."
"LUKE: It's disgusting. It's making me sick to my stomach."
"LORELAI: Well then, have you ever thought that maybe you're in the wrong industry?"
"LUKE: I should get rid of the plates, make 'em all strap on a feed bag, you know, hang bells around their necks. Enter them in county fairs."
"[A pair of customers leave.]"
"LORELAI: Come again, soon. See ya! [to Luke] Listen, Luke, could you hit the pause button on the rant for just a sec?"
"LUKE: What do you need?"
"LORELAI: I was wondering if we could have dinner tonight."
"LUKE: Dinner?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I need to discuss something with you, and I thought maybe we could do it over dinner unless you and Nicole have -"
"LUKE: She's in Boston this week."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, how about Silvano's, 8:00?"
"LUKE: Why don't you just come here? I could make us some…"
"LORELAI: No, this isn't diner talk. It's more official."
"LUKE: Are you being drafted?"
"LORELAI: Yes, that's it."
"LUKE: You have to wear a tie at Silvano's."
"LORELAI: No, just a jacket, and you can take it off the minute we sit down."
"LUKE: Okay, 8:00."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll see you there. [moved to door]"
"LUKE: Love the hat."
"LORELAI: Livin' on a prayer, baby. [exits]"
"[Bemused, Luke crosses his arms and watches her walk off.]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK"
"[Lane is walking down the street with a full grocery bag when she sees her mother approaching. They both hesitate before continuing to walk toward each other.]"
"MRS. KIM: Hello, Lane."
"LANE: Hello, Mrs. Kim. [Mrs Kim stars to walk away] I'm staying at Lorelai's."
"MRS. KIM: Wear socks. [walks on]"
"LANE: Okay."
"CUT TO YALE CLASS HALLWAY"
"[Rory, cell phone to her ear, is walking down busy hall.]"
"LORELAI's ANSWERING MACHINE: ...and I'll return your call as soon as possible, thanks."
"RORY: [leaving voice message] So I'm on my way to my professor's office to ask him a question about his last lecture because my pen was giving out, and I can't read my own writing, which is not at all true. However, it will give him a perfect opportunity to discuss my paper with me since I'm sure he's graded it by now, and since I'm also sure I'm in for a big helping of ""Nicely done, Miss Gilmore, how about an 'A'."" Call me. [she stops before teacher's office door and knocks]"
"PROF. GILBERT: [from inside] Come in."
"RORY: [enters office] Professor Gilbert? Hi, I'm Rory Gilmore. I'm in your Tuesday afternoon Game Theory class. I hope I'm not disturbing you."
"PROF. GILBERT: Come in."
"RORY: Thank you. I was wondering if I could go over a couple of things from your lecture the other day."
"PROF. GILBERT: Uh-hmm [stands and begins shuffling through papers behind her without speaking]"
"RORY: Okay, well, I wrote something down here, but I cannot for the life of me read my own handwriting. Seriously, if I had this analyzed, Charlize Theron would be playing me in a movie… 'Cause I'd be a serial k*ll, and pretty girls like to get fat and play serial k*ll 'cause they win an Oscar and - I'm sorry, should I go on?"
"PROF. GILBERT: Or you can just wait to let me find your paper so we can talk about why you're really here."
"RORY: Oh. [embarrassed] Well, Okay. [nervous giggle - sits down]"
"PROF. GILBERT: Rory Gilmore. [He pulls her paper from the middle of the pile.] Yes, here we are. [reads notes while returning to seat] Yes. Right. Okay. Good you came in."
"RORY: It is?"
"PROF. GILBERT: Yes. Now, in this paper, you were supposed to use a real world example to compare and contrast classical economic theory and game theory, yes?"
"RORY: Yes."
"PROF. GILBERT: Okay, now your paper dealt well enough with the game theory portion. However, you then diverged into a discussion on the pollution problem in Mexico City."
"RORY: Uh-huh."
"PROF. GILBERT: Well, it felt to me like someone using knowledge from a different course to pad their paper and thereby avoid doing research for mine."
"RORY: Oh, no, I just --"
"PROF. GILBERT: I've seen this happen before, particularly to freshmen. Usually, it just means that they're overloading themselves, that they don't fully understand the demands of a Yale academic curriculum. So, I took the liberty of looking over your schedule, and I think that's what you've done."
"RORY: Oh, no, no, I'm fine, really. I just have a little trouble with game theory, that's all. I blame my mother. She always made up the games at home when I was growing up. I begged her for Monopoly, but she insisted on ""Mimic Your Favorite Sweat Hog"", so…"
"PROF. GILBERT: I talked with your advisor. She has the same concern that I do."
"RORY: What concern is that?"
"PROF. GILBERT: You're taking too many courses this semester. Your workload is too heavy."
"RORY: I'll try harder."
"PROF. GILBERT: I think you should drop this course. You still have a couple of weeks left before the end of the drop period. You can take the course again when you have more time to devote to it."
"RORY: But, my grandfather took this same workload when he went here."
"PROF. GILBERT: Different people work at different paces. You shouldn't compare yourself to anyone else. You work at a slower pace."
"RORY: I don't. I'm not…"
"PROF. GILBERT: The choice is ultimately yours. You can stay, but this is a ""D"" paper. This is not a big deal. This happens to a lot of students."
"RORY: [stands, smooths hair and moves toward door] Okay. Glad to be fitting in. [exits]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE INSIDE FRONT DOOR"
"[The doorbell rings. The maid opens the door to reveal Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: [to maid] Hi. I'm Lore--"
"EMILY: Get in here right now."
"LORELAI: My gran must be here. [begins to remove coat]"
"EMILY: [to maid] Jersey, close the door and get those nuts in the living room [hurriedly yanks off Lorelai's coat]."
"LORELAI: Well.. Ow."
"EMILY: I've been alone with that woman for over two hours now."
"LORELAI: Real arm in the coat, Mom."
"EMILY: Your father's late. You're late."
"LORELAI: I'm not late, just in pain."
"EMILY: Get in the living room."
"LORELAI: I can't arrive before the nuts."
"EMILY: Don't start with me."
"CUT TO SITTING ROOM"
"EMILY: Here she is, Mom, Lorelai. The party just gets bigger."
"LORELAI: Hi, Gran, how are you doing? You look great."
"TRIX: Emily, what is the matter with her hair?"
"EMILY: Oh, well..."
"[Lorelai fusses with her hair.]"
"TRIX: I know my granddaughter. If she had received proper notice of my arrival, she would have done something about it."
"EMILY: I told her in plenty of time, Mom."
"LORELAI: She really did, Gran. I swear."
"TRIX: I think it is admirable of you to cover for your mother. The importance of family loyalty simply cannot be measured. Sit, dear. Other than your hair, you look well. Are you well? Emily, perhaps the girl would like a drink."
"LORELAI: I am very well."
"TRIX: Good. How is Rory?"
"LORELAI: She's just as healthy as I am."
"EMILY: [from the bar] And her hair is perfect."
"TRIX: And how is she doing at Yale?"
"LORELAI: She's doing great, studying her butt off."
"TRIX: Oh, how charming to hear. I'm glad she's doing well. She is a Gilmore, after all. Gilmores have always excelled at Yale. They have quite a legacy to live up to."
"LORELAI: Well, your legacy is safe with her."
"[The maid enters with a crystal bowl.]"
"EMILY: [shrilly] Mom, here are the nuts."
"TRIX: Oh, thank you, Emily, for that announcement. How wonderful that you don't need some sort of amplification system in order to make sure that everyone in the area is informed about the arrival of the nuts."
"EMILY: I'm sorry. [embarrassed]"
"TRIX: [to Lorelai] Strange woman, so excited about nuts."
"RICHARD: [from other room] I smell jasmine."
"[Richard enters with Jason behind him]"
"TRIX: You smell impatience. Where have you been?"
"RICHARD: You know very well where I've been. [kisses Trix's cheek] I had some work to get out of the way so I could devote my full attention to you. You look wonderful. Florida agrees with you."
"TRIX: Florida agrees with muscle-bound men who dress like women. I am much happier to be back here where I belong. Would you like a nut? They seem to be very important to your wife."
"EMILY: I thought you liked those nuts, Mom."
"RICHARD: I'm fine, Trix. I have someone I would like you to meet. [turns and sees Lorelai for the first time] Lorelai, have you been there the whole time?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I have."
"RICHARD: Well, I didn't see you."
"LORELAI: Well, I had my cloaking device activated, so --"
"RICHARD: [ignores her] Trix, this is my partner, Jason Stiles. Jason, this is my mother."
"JASON: It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Gilmore."
"TRIX: You are very young."
"JASON: Oh, no, no, no, not so young."
"TRIX: I think I know if someone is young or not."
"EMILY: [exasperated] For God's sake, Jason, just be young."
"[Jason looks helplessly at Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: [to Jason] Cloaking device, never leave home without it."
"TRIX: Richard Gilmore, you're growing a mustache."
"EMILY: I know, the Ferrari is arriving on Tuesday."
"TRIX: I like it."
"RICHARD: Thank you, Trix."
"TRIX: It makes you look like Adolphe Menjou."
"EMILY: [under her breath] Or Adolphe Menjou's cocaine dealer."
"[Jason presents a wrapped gift to Trix.]"
"TRIX: What is that?"
"JASON: Well, actually, this is a little present that I got for you."
"TRIX: For me?"
"JASON: Yes."
"TRIX: Why would you give me a present?"
"JASON: [uncomfortably] Well.."
"TRIX: It's not my birthday. It's not Christmas."
"JASON: Yes, but..."
"TRIX: You don't even know me."
"JASON: No, but you're Richard's mother, so I thought --"
"TRIX: What is it? What is this present that you got for an old woman you've never met?"
"JASON: [pause] It's a book."
"TRIX: What sort of book?"
"JASON: It's a book on French antiques. I heard you liked French antiques."
"TRIX: I do like French antiques."
"JASON: You can just open it later. [sets box on nearby table]"
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings in her purse and she reaches for it.]"
"TRIX: Absolutely not -- I am company. You don't answer the phone when you have company,"
"so put it away and turn it off."
"LORELAI: Yes, Gran."
"TRIX: Now, shall we all take turns guessing how long it will be before lunch is served? I will say an hour. Richard?"
"RICHARD: [laughing] You are bad, Trix."
"[Emily rolls her eyes and gulps her drink.]"
"CUT TO YALE - RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory attempts to call her mother.]"
"LORELAI'S VOICE MAIL: Hi, this is Lorelai Gilmore, and you've reached my cell phone. Leave a message, and I'll return your call -"
"RORY: [Sighs, then hangs up when gets voicemail. Grabs car keys and exits]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE LIBRARY"
"[Lorelai is staring at her cell phone. Jason enters.]"
"JASON: [whispers] Hey, you on the phone?"
"LORELAI: [whispers] No, I'm just checking my messages."
"JASON: Anything important?"
"LORELAI: No, just a hang up."
"JASON: Good, good. [looks at nearby decorative globe] You know, I should get a globe. Every time you see a movie, and there's a really important character, and then you go into that character's office, they always have a globe."
"LORELAI: You're hiding from my grandmother, aren't you?"
"JASON: She is scarier than Nick Nolte's mug sh*t."
"LORELAI: Come on. [ushering him out]"
"JASON: Please, she's just gonna ask me why I got her a present again."
"CUT TO GILMORE HALLWAY"
"[Jason and Lorelai meet the others.]"
"TRIX: We have decided to just go sit at the table. Perhaps the food will appear by sheer wish fulfillment."
"EMILY: I'll check on it again, Mom."
"TRIX: Oh, please don't. I wouldn't want to disturb your cook. She's obviously in the middle of a crossword puzzle. [they all settle at table] Lorelai, where did you go?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, Gran. I had to check my messages. I've got all this construction going on at the inn."
"TRIX: Yes, your inn. [to Richard] Have you seen this inn of hers?"
"RICHARD: No, not yet."
"LORELAI: No, it's a mess right now. You'll all see it when it's done."
"TRIX: And when will that be?"
"LORELAI: Soon."
"TRIX: I see you measure time like your mother."
"EMILY: [helplessly] Just let me check on lunch, please?"
"TRIX: So tell me, Lorelai. How much money have you invested in this inn?"
"LORELAI: Oh, a chunk."
"TRIX: And I assume that you have a projected timetable for getting your chunk back out?"
"LORELAI: Well, if everything goes as planned, we're hoping to break even the first year and turn a profit the second year."
"TRIX: That's optimistic, yes?"
"LORELAI: Yes, but our town has a pretty regular tourist trade."
"JASON: You know, small inns and bed and breakfasts can be real money factories."
"TRIX: Yes, and wonderful places to put all those French antiques."
"LORELAI: Well, we have very high hopes, and we booked our first reservation."
"EMILY: When is the reservation?"
"LORELAI: May 8th."
"RICHARD: Really? That soon?"
"EMILY: You'll be ready by then?"
"LORELAI: Well, we'll have to be. We had to add some extra construction guys, and we'll have to get the sink back from Canada, but we'll finish in time."
"TRIX: How is the money holding up?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"TRIX: The money. I was somewhat aware of your financial situation before you took this on. How much do you have left?"
"LORELAI: Plenty. Enough to finish."
"TRIX: You're in trouble."
"LORELAI: No."
"TRIX: You are hemorrhaging money. I see it in your eyes. It must be costing a fortune to get a contractor to stick to a projected completion date. And you're not working now. Unless your partner is a Rockefeller, you are in serious financial trouble."
"EMILY: Mom, I don't think this is the best time to discuss this."
"TRIX: Well, if we were eating, we would have something else to do, but since we're not... [to Richard] How could you let this happen?"
"RICHARD: How could I let this happen?"
"TRIX: She is your daughter. It is your responsibility to know when she is in deep financial trouble."
"LORELAI: I'm not in deep financial trouble."
"RICHARD: Trix, Lorelai is a grown woman."
"TRIX: Ridiculous. This is a family. It is a family's responsibility to make sure that this doesn't happen. We have a reputation to uphold. How would it look if a Gilmore goes out into the business world and fails?"
"EMILY: I hardly think she's failing, Mom."
"TRIX: Well, she looks like she's failing to me. [Lorelai chuckles nervously. Trix turns to Richard.] And I am surprised at you. After all, I helped you out when you had financial problems."
"RICHARD: Trix!"
"TRIX: You made that terrible investment in Dubliners Paper Corporation when you were first married. I told you not to, but you wouldn't listen, and of course, I had to step in and bail you out."
"RICHARD: Now, hold on here, Trix."
"TRIX: You would have lost this house if it weren't for me."
"RICHARD: That is not true."
"TRIX: It is not true that you pigheadedly lost that money?"
"RICHARD: I was twenty-seven years old. That is the time to take risks."
"TRIX: Well, when you have my money to bail you out, taking risks is not much of a problem, is it?"
"RICHARD: [angry] You're making me sound like an incompetent child."
"TRIX: Oh, please."
"RICHARD: [angry] I have built two extremely successful businesses, Mother, and both of them without your help. [Emily smiles brightly] And I do not appreciate you now, many years later, throwing in my face the fact that you once helped me out financially!"
"TRIX: Do not raise your voice to me."
"RICHARD: I will raise my voice if the situation warrants it!"
"[The maid enters with salad plates.]"
"EMILY: Oh, no, not now. [to Richard] You paid that money back in two months, also."
"RICHARD: That's right, two months. How deep in financial ruin could I have been to get that money back to you in two months?"
"TRIX: I'm leaving this table."
"RICHARD: Let me help you with your chair."
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN CONSTRUCTION SIGHT - EVENING"
"[Rory approaches Tom as he gathers his belongings to leave.]"
"RORY: Hey, Tom, is my mom here?"
"TOM: I haven't seen her. She could be inside. She sometimes slips in the back door, likes to surprise a bunch of guys with nail g*n."
"RORY: Thanks. [She enters the Dragonfly Inn.] Mom?"
"DEAN: [approaches] Rory. Hey."
"RORY: Do you know where my mom is?"
"DEAN: No, did you check outside?"
"RORY: Yeah, I did. She's not there. She's not at home. She's not anywhere. [slight trembling voice]"
"DEAN: Are you okay?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm fine. I just - I can't find her."
"DEAN: Well, maybe she's at Sookie's."
"RORY: Sookie's? Okay, I can try Sookie's. [She fumbles with her cell phone.]"
"DEAN: Rory, what's wrong?"
"RORY: Nothing. Nothing's wrong. I'm fine, I'm good. I'm just having some technical difficulties. Get it? [shakes her phone] Technical difficulties? Very funny, eh?"
"DEAN: Yeah, it's very funny."
"RORY: I know, I am very funny, and I am getting funnier. Yale is doing that to me. I am just -- it's really developing, the hilarity. Where are we going?"
"DEAN: Outside. [guides her to the exit]"
"RORY: Outside? Sure, 'cause I'm used to working a bigger room."
"DEAN: [gently] What's wrong?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"[Dean guides her to the steps where they sit.]"
"DEAN: What's wrong?"
"RORY: [voice breaking] Everything's falling apart. I thought I had it all under control, but I don't."
"DEAN: What? What was under control?"
"RORY: Everybody else can handle the classes, but I can't. And I'm supposed to. I'm supposed to take five classes. Everybody else does. I mean, my grandfather did. [sigh] God, how am I gonna tell my grandfather that I failed?"
"DEAN: You failed?"
"RORY: No, I didn't even get a chance to fail. I mean -- [sniff] I had to drop a class. I was told to drop a class."
"DEAN: That's not a big deal."
"RORY: It's a really big deal. I'm not supposed to drop a class. I'm not the drop-a-class person. I get good grades. [trembling voice] I… handle things."
"DEAN: Hey, come on. [ Puts his arm around her, rubbing her arm ]"
"RORY: And Lane, she's not around anymore, and I -- I know she had to go, but I miss her, and I liked her there, and I haven't talked to my mom, and I need to talk to her, and she's not around. And I'm failing. I'm failing everything. I can't do it. I can't handle it. I'm messing everything up! [ Sobbing ] Oh! God, just look at this."
"DEAN: Look at what?"
"RORY: You having to be nice to me. I mean, you shouldn't have to be nice to me. I was horrible to you, and now you're married to someone nice and who's not me and not a failure."
"DEAN: You are so not a failure."
"RORY: [sobbing] Yes, I am. I just can't, I -- I need to talk to my mom 'cause I just don't know what to do."
"DEAN: It's okay. [He hugs her close, comforting her.]"
"STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK - NIGHT"
"[Luke, nicely dressed with keys in hand, walks around his truck and spots Lorelai approaching.]"
"LORELAI: Luke."
"LUKE: Hey, I was just coming to meet you."
"LORELAI: I know. Yeah. [nervously smoothing hair] Could we uh, -- I need to --- I'm sorry, I need to reschedule our dinner."
"LUKE: Oh sure."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'm just very tired."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: So I'm sorry that I made you get all dressed up."
"LUKE: That's okay, it's good for me to do it every once in awhile. It reminds me why I'm not an accountant."
"LORELAI: [odd giggle] Okay."
"LUKE: [concerned] Everything okay?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Are you okay?"
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: Because you don't look okay."
"LORELAI: Well, geez, take me now, sailor."
"LUKE: I mean, you look distracted."
"LORELAI: Distracted, no. Well, maybe -- yeah. Distracted, okay, sure. I'm very distracted."
"LUKE: Anything I can do?"
"LORELAI: You know, there are very few times in my life when I find myself sitting around thinking, ""I wish I was married,"" but today, I mean -- I'm happy. You know? I like my life. I like my friends. I like my stuff. My time, my space, my TV."
"LUKE: Yeah, sure."
"LORELAI: But every now and then, just for a moment, I wish I had a partner, someone to pick up the slack. Someone to wait for the cable guy, make me coffee in the morning, meet the stupid sink before it gets sent back to Canada. [wanders to nearby bench and sits]"
"LUKE: What happened? [joins her on bench]"
"LORELAI: [ Voice breaking ] Um... [ Sniffles ] I just thought I had everything under control, but I didn't, and the inn is just falling apart. This has been my dream forever, and I have it, and it's here, and I'm failing. I can't handle it. I just spend every minute running around and working and thinking. [Luke puts his arm across the back of the bench and listens quietly.] And I thought I would have help, but Sookie has Davey, and Michel has Celine, and I'm -- I can't do it all by myself. [[Luke moves closer.] And I don't even have time to see my kid, and hell, forget see her, just even talk to her. And I miss her. And I sat there in my parents' house just listening to my grandmother basically call me a charity case, and I couldn't even argue with her. I couldn't even say anything, because I am. I'm running out of money, and I don't know what to do about it, and I was gonna, I was gonna ask you for $30,000 at dinner tonight. That's how pathetic I am."
"LUKE: Thirty thousand dollars. Well, okay, I mean if you --"
"LORELAI: I don't want to talk about it now. I don't want to think about it. [hiding face, she leans against his chest] I'm failing. [ Sobs ] I'm failing."
"[Luke hugs her close, strokes her hair, and gently rubs her arm.]"
"LUKE: You are not failing."
"LORELAI: [muffled] I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do."
"LUKE: [gently] It's okay."
"CUT TO YALE - RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory listens to her answering machine.]"
"LORELAI'S VOICE: Hi, hon. I'm just seeing if I could catch you, but you're out. So...nothing much to report here. Just give me a call when you can."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai listens to her answering machine.]"
"RORY'S VOICE: Just checking in. Nothing big to report. Okay, give me a call when you can. Bye, mom."

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai enters with a laptop in her arms.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey!"
"LORELAI: [chuckles and reaches for food on plates he is serving] Ow!"
"LUKE: Don't."
"LORELAI: Ohh. [feigns disappointed]"
"LUKE: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Well, you hurt my feelings just now."
"LUKE: No, I mean you doing okay with everything?"
"LORELAI: You're referring to my meltdown in the park."
"LUKE: It wasn't a meltdown."
"LORELAI: Oh, it was a meltdown. They're making it into a movie -- ""Meltdown in the Park."" Don't worry, it's just a working title. Baz Luhrmann's directing. And the movie Luke wears tights and sings."
"LUKE: But you're okay?"
"LORELAI: Thanks to my knight in shining armor."
"LUKE: Ah, well…"
"LORELAI: I just hope Alec Baldwin captures your rare essence."
"LUKE: And slims down a little for the role. I should deliver these."
"LORELAI: Can I work on my laptop?"
"LUKE: Does it make noise?"
"LORELAI: No, but I sometimes do."
"LUKE: You always do."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"[Kirk enters the diner with a pink bag under his arm.]"
"LUKE: Kirk."
"KIRK: Luke."
"LUKE: What's with the -"
"KIRK: It's not a purse!"
"LUKE: I wasn't gonna say ""purse."""
"KIRK: Oh… Sorry."
"LUKE: What's with the gay bag?"
"KIRK: It's a dog carrier. My girlfriend's gone out of town with some friends, and I'm watching Buster for her. And they're girlfriends, not guys. I called the hotel she booked and verified that it's a girl's name on the register with her. Not that I don't trust her."
"LUKE: Clearly."
"KIRK: Over there okay?"
"LUKE: Sure. Carol, Danny, Jamie, Sean, Chris?"
"KIRK: What's that?"
"LUKE: Just a list of guys' names that could be girls. You want coffee?"
"KIRK: Yes."
"[Luke returns behind the counter]"
"LUKE: What is this?"
"LORELAI: Phone cord."
"LUKE: I can't have this here."
"LORELAI: Don't worry. It's not plugged in to your regular line. It's the fax line you put in a year ago that you never use."
"LUKE: You mean the fax line you made me put in to get in fax orders, even though no one has ever wanted to put in a fax order, and I never got the fax machine, like I told you I would never, ever get the fax machine, making the fax line pointless."
"LORELAI: Hold on… Let me get on the ""Guinness World Records"" website. [clicking on her keyboard] Yes, that's the most times anyone has ever used the word ""fax"" in a sentence."
"LUKE: Just be quick with this."
"LORELAI: Man, I love e-mail. Every day Rory and I write each other multiple times. It's great."
"LUKE: You enjoy typing to people more than talking to them?"
"LORELAI: Wrong perspective. E-mail is a return to the romantic days of letter writing. It's pure Dickens."
"LUKE: Why Dickens?"
"LORELAI: It's just when I picture letter writing, I picture Charles Dickens."
"LUKE: Charles Dickens wrote more letters than other people?"
"LORELAI: No, it's just I can easily picture him in his study with his dog and his pipe and his fancy feathered pen, writing [British accent] ""Cheerio, old bean. Have a cup of tea. How's Big Ben? How's the Tower of London, Sister Suffragette? Tuppence a bag."""
"LUKE: Sounds like an idiot. [struggles to crawl under phone cord]"
"CAESAR: Hey, Luke, coffee?."
"LUKE: [struggles back under cord] Oh, this is embarrassing."
"LORELAI: I could unplug, but then I'd just have to start the whole process all over again."
"LUKE: Or you could just eat here and save e-mailing for when you're...excuse me [A delayed realization sinks in and he walks over to Kirk's table.] You have a dog there?"
"KIRK: No. Why?"
"LUKE: Just putting two and two together."
"KIRK: Well, it's coming out five. Buster is at home, asleep."
"LUKE: Mm-hmm. Okay. What'll you have?"
"KIRK: Oatmeal, extra brown sugar on the side, and a pound of raw hamburger. [sees Luke's dark expression] Or just the oatmeal will be fine."
"[Luke returns to the counter and now Lorelai's computer cord is balanced atop stacked menus. He sighs.]"
"LORELAI: Voila!"
"LUKE: This does nothing."
"LORELAI: It makes it easier to limbo under."
"LUKE: This is my place. I shouldn't have to limbo."
"KIRK: [high voice] You still sleepy?"
"LORELAI: [glances over at Kirk's table] Why is Kirk talking to his man purse?"
"KIRK: You got sleepy face. You have to tinkle? [realizes he's being watched and nnonchalantlyreaches into bag] Uh, where is that? Just looking for my Lucky magazine, and, uh...ow! [ Grunts ] Paper cut."
"OPEN TO YALE DORM ROOM"
"[Rory coughs then reaches into the mini-fridge.]"
"PARIS: What are you doing?"
"RORY: Getting a drink."
"PARIS: You're sick."
"RORY: Hence the fluids."
"PARIS: When you came out of our room, did you use the doorknob?"
"RORY: As opposed to dematerializing, passing vapor-like through the wall, then rematerializing out here? No, I used the doorknob."
"PARIS: For the love of God, I begged you not to touch anything. [Paris sprays an aerosol can over the doorknob.]"
"RORY: I'm not contagious anymore. Paris, stop!"
"PARIS: I'm not getting sick."
"RORY: That's your deodorant."
"PARIS: Then what the hell did I spray under my arms?"
"[A cell phone rings in distance. Rory goes into her room to answer it.]"
"RORY: That's mine. [answers] Hello."
"LANE: Guess where I'm standing."
"RORY: I don't know but you sound a little echoey."
"[cutting between Rory's dorm and Lane's apartment]"
"LANE: I'm standing in the living room of my very own apartment!"
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LANE: I'm waiting for the gas man. The gas man! Isn't that great? I've got gas! Ignore the word. Just focus on the enthusiasm."
"RORY: How are you affording this?"
"LANE: I'm sharing it with Zach and Brian."
"RORY: You're living with the band?"
"LANE: It's totally innocent, I have my own room, and they're gonna sleep in the living room."
"RORY: That is so cool. When do you move your stuff in?"
"LANE: Tomorrow. That is if my mom hasn't sold it all by now. Hey, you sound a little stuffed."
"RORY: I've been sick, but it's mostly deodorant stench I'm suffering from at the moment."
"LANE: Oh, my God! My first mail is here! It's a Chinese menu."
"RORY: Frame it or something."
"LANE: I will. I've gotta go, I'll call you later."
"RORY: Bye. [glances over at bedroom doorway where Paris is holding cigarette lighter flame under the door knob.] Oh, that's not dangerous."
"PARIS: Fire k*ll germs. [holding shirt over nose as Rory passes by] And I'm sleeping with one of the other girls tonight."
"RORY: How very ""The L Word""."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai packs up her laptop.]"
"LUKE: You done?"
"LORELAI: Oh yes, your limboing days are over, my friend. Thanks for putting up with me."
"LUKE: Well, I only fell once."
"LORELAI: And gracefully. Bye."
"LUKE: Wait a minute. Hold on."
"LORELAI: Why? [Luke glances around covertly] You're making me nervous."
"LUKE: Just, uh... [slides an envelope over to her] here."
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"LUKE: It's what it is."
"LORELAI: [hold envelope to forehead] ""A monk, a trunk, and a skunk."""
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Carnak, although I don't have a punch line. Never stopped Johnny."
"LUKE: Put that down. Hide it."
"LORELAI: What is it?"
"LUKE: Open it later."
"[After opening the envelope, Lorelai sighs and sits down.]"
"LORELAI: A check to me for $30,000."
"LUKE: Shh!"
"LORELAI: Luke, this is the money I was gonna ask you for."
"LUKE: And you did ask, and there it is."
"LORELAI: But I didn't. Not officially. I blubbered an amount to you, and we didn't get to talk about a repayment schedule."
"LUKE: It's okay."
"LORELAI: Or interest or collateral. I had charts and projections. I wanted to take you out to a nice dinner."
"LUKE: So send me a Honeybaked Ham."
"LORELAI: But this is wrong. This is not how you do these things."
"LUKE: I don't know how to do these things. Will you just take the money?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, we at least have to go over the basics. [She pulls out napkin and scribbles on it.]"
"LUKE: I don't want to read that."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm not leaving until you read this napkin. [She pushes the napkin over to Luke.]"
"LUKE: Okay. [He reads and edits the napkin.] Fine. Okay? That's okay. That's too much. That's sufficient. [He passes the napkin back to Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, but what about this? [She writes something down and passes it back.]"
"LUKE: Nicole?!"
"LORELAI: Hey! I thought we were writing and sliding."
"LUKE: What about Nicole?"
"LORELAI: I need to know her role."
"LUKE: There is none."
"LORELAI: Luke, if it's joint money, then I should acknowledge that and thank her the next time I see her…"
"LUKE: You're not gonna see her. Now, can we stop talking about this whole thing?"
"LORELAI: Okay, but I insist on typing up something legal and binding for this loan."
"LUKE: Okay, okay. I really just don't want to talk about this anymore."
"LORELAI: Okay. We'll dot the Is and cross the Ts another day."
"LUKE: Yes, we'll cross and dot."
"LORELAI: I just have to write down one more thing."
"LUKE: What! [impatiently] What is so important now? [reads the napkin] You're welcome."
"[Lorelai gathers up her belongings and leaves. Luke smiles down at the note.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE FRONT HALL"
"[The doorbell rings and the maid answers. Lorelai enters.]"
"LORELAI: Hi. [The maid exits quickly.]"
"EMILY: [enters speaking impatiently on a cordless phone] Gilmore -- Richard and Emily Gilmore. Look, we single-handedly put your restaurant on the map by praising your crab puffs at Eunice Pierpont Pennington's granddaughter's christening."
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom. [follows and waves to Emily]"
"EMILY: [still speaking into phone] Oh, really? You're new there? Because your deft handling of this phone call displays all the signs of a seasoned and experienced hand. [brief pause] Yes, go get Trey. That's a smashing idea. [to Lorelai] Painful hello."
"LORELAI: What's going on? [removes coat]"
"EMILY: You couldn't see the smoke from Stars Hollow? Lettie b*rned the entrée."
"LORELAI: Beyond edibility? 'Cause I'm not picky."
"EMILY: No, I could not expose you to such a loin."
"LORELAI: Oh, if I had a nickel."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: So you had a burning loin."
"EMILY: And now I'm fighting to squeeze us into somewhere appropriate."
"LORELAI: Someone to take pity on the loinless."
"EMILY: Is that how you're dressed?"
"LORELAI: Is this a trick question?"
"EMILY: It's really not appropriate to go out in."
"LORELAI: Well, I did not foresee your burning loin."
"EMILY: Stop saying that word."
"LORELAI: When will I get this chance again?"
"EMILY: I've seen that on you a dozen times. You really should update your wardrobe."
"LORELAI: My wardrobe is fine, Mom."
"EMILY: The summer lines are coming out. You should hit a store."
"[Richard enters.]"
"RICHARD: No need for you to hit any more stores, Emily. You've done enough shopping for a lifetime. For Methuselah's lifetime. [to his daughter] Hello, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi, Dad."
"EMILY: I didn't say I was going shopping, Richard."
"RICHARD: It's an instinct that requires no verbalization."
"EMILY: I was suggesting that your daughter update her wardrobe."
"RICHARD: No need to spread your disease either."
"EMILY: Richard!"
"LORELAI: Really Dad, don't read more into this than what it is: just humiliating me."
"RICHARD: Ah."
"EMILY: I should hang up and let you both starve."
"RICHARD: What do you mean, starve? What happened to dinner?"
"EMILY: I told you not five minutes ago that dinner was ruined."
"RICHARD: Did you?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"RICHARD: I heard the word ""loin,"" but I didn't think you meant dinner. [grins]"
"LORELAI: Eh...This is making me very uncomfortable."
"EMILY: That's because you half listen to everything I say. [to phone] Yes, I'm still here. Good, check with him. [to Richard] I think we have a sh*t at Bastide."
"RICHARD: Isn't that a little drab?"
"EMILY: We love Bastide."
"RICHARD: You love Bastide. Why don't we try that place Jason took me to last week? A lot of hip clientele. He pointed out Moby to me. He's that bald musician."
"LORELAI: Yep, that's pretty hip, Dad."
"EMILY: When did you have dinner with Moby?"
"RICHARD: Moby was just there. Jason played me some of his music later. I liked it."
"EMILY: We're going to Bastide, but don't fret. Maybe the b*at will be there and you can sit in and jam with them."
"RICHARD: Two of the b*at are dead, Emily."
"EMILY: Only one is dead."
"RICHARD: No, a second b*at died just recently. Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Could you press the ""pause"" button on this conversation? I really want Rory to hear the rest of it."
"EMILY: If we're going to Bastide, you should change your jacket, Richard."
"RICHARD: All right."
"EMILY: And please shave that moustache, I beg of you."
"RICHARD: I want to see what it looks like fully grown, Emily. That was the agreement."
"EMILY: Well, it looks like a caterpillar now. In two weeks it'll look like a bigger caterpillar."
"RICHARD: Very funny."
"EMILY: I'm not trying to be funny."
"RICHARD: I will shave it when I shave it. [moves to stairs]"
"EMILY: [into phone] Yes. Yes, we'll be there. Thank you. [to Richard] Wait! They said they can take us if we can be there in five minutes and order as quickly as possible."
"RICHARD: Well it'll take longer than that."
"EMILY: Not if we move."
"RICHARD: What about my jacket?"
"EMILY: Doesn't matter. They'll be staring at your moustache."
"RICHARD: Emily."
"EMILY: Come on. Scoot, scoot. And be thinking about what you want."
"LORELAI: Whoa, just one little problem here. Rory?"
"EMILY: What about her?"
"LORELAI: She's not here yet."
"EMILY: She's not coming."
"LORELAI: She's not coming?"
"EMILY: No, she's been sick all week. I told her to stay in her dorm and rest."
"LORELAI: She's been sick?"
"EMILY: Didn't you know?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I knew."
"EMILY: [hurries out the door] I'm having sea bass. Think, think."
"RICHARD: Mm-hmm. [He shuts the door behind him.]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai types on a laptop, staring at the screen.]"
"LORELAI: I knew it. [She dials the phone.]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: We have an e-mail relationship."
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: [gasps] She speaks. She has the ability."
"RORY: What's wrong?"
"LORELAI: Are you okay? Are you sick?"
"RORY: I'm getting over a cold. You knew that."
"LORELAI: No, I didn't, because our once-wonderful relationship -- envy of all the world, more intimate than that of the naked couple in the ""love is..."" cartoons -- has degenerated into e-mail correspondence."
"RORY: I'm sure I wrote that I had a cold."
"LORELAI: No, you didn't."
"RORY: In all those e-mails, I didn't mention it?"
"LORELAI: All those e-mails? I'm sorry, but you write less than the people offering to enlarge a piece of anatomy I do not possess."
"RORY: I could have sworn I told you."
"LORELAI: I just reread every e-mail you sent in the past ten days. No sickness mention, but you did share these gems: ""Hey, what up? Is it freezing there, too? Ice."" And, ""Whew. Pooped."" Then you added one of those obnoxious hieroglyphics that I can never read that are supposed to indicate you're laughing or smiling or frowning or vomiting. I don't know what."
"RORY: That's a typo. I don't do cutesy symbols."
"LORELAI: You're not even using verbs. That's not a relationship. Relationships need verbs."
"RORY: Well yours aren't much better."
"LORELAI: I'm not saying they are."
"RORY: I can never get you on the phone."
"LORELAI: [gasps] I can never get you!"
"RORY: You got me now."
"LORELAI: Freak of nature. What do you look like. Do you look the same?"
"RORY: Hold on. My nose ring is itching."
"LORELAI: Don't kid. I'm mad and needy, and I ended up going out to dinner alone with my parents, who bickered the whole time about which b*at is alive and which is dead."
"RORY: So, where'd they land?"
"LORELAI: John and Keith are dead. Paul and Bingo are still kicking. Play hooky tomorrow."
"RORY: From what?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Whatever you got. I know you're always busy, but let's do something."
"RORY: What about the inn?"
"LORELAI: They can live without me for a day."
"RORY: Tomorrow's actually good."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: There's a newspaper thing, but I can skip that."
"LORELAI: Cool! What do we do?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Mom said the summer clothing lines are out. Want to go shopping? We haven't done that in ages."
"RORY: But we're both totally skint."
"LORELAI: Huh? We're what?"
"RORY: We're skint -- broke. It's British."
"LORELAI: Oh man, you've learned to speak British. I didn't even know about it."
"RORY: You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: So we won't buy anything. We'll just window-shop."
"RORY: That could be fun."
"LORELAI: It'll be like we're in an old movie, y'know? Walking around, window-shopping like Roz Russell and Ava Gardner on Fifth Avenue."
"RORY: I'm with you."
"LORELAI: Meet me at the inn, 10:00?"
"RORY: But it's been so long. How will we recognize each other?"
"LORELAI: We'll wear a rose in our lapels."
"RORY: Or dangling from my nose ring."
"LORELAI: You're kidding about that, right?"
"RORY: I'm leaving you in suspense."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow at 10:00, Roz darling?"
"RORY: Till tomorrow, Ava dearest."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE ENTRANCE OF DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Luke exits with a bag of groceries as Kirk approaches with a mob of leashed dogs.]"
"KIRK: Look out. Coming through."
"LUKE: What's with all the dogs, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Well, people in town saw how good I was with Lulu's dog that they asked me to watch theirs -- for a fee, of course."
"LUKE: What are you looking for?"
"KIRK: Shh. Come on. [He walks around corner followed by Luke.] It's a game I'm playing with the dogs -- tracker. See, I cut one of them loose, and then the rest of us hide until we get tracked down. At the moment, we're hiding from Snuggles."
"LUKE: We are?"
"KIRK: It helps them hone their tracking k*ll, and the kids love it."
"LUKE: What kids?"
"KIRK: The babies. The dogs."
"LUKE: You ever the one that gets cut loose?"
"KIRK: I've gone twice. Shh. Snuggles. Cute, but not the smartest tool in the shed. [small shaggy dog crosses the street - pauses and runs straight to Kirk] He found us! Celebrate! Come on, Luke. Celebrate!"
"LUKE: I'll have a beer tonight."
"KIRK: Beer? Oh, no! We don't like beer. Beer is bad. Cookies! [all the dogs leap up onto Kirk] Cookies! Cookies! Cookies! Cookies! Celebrate! Cookies! [Dog barks]"
"[Luke looks back at Kirk's display in disgust - turns and walks away]"
"CUT TO CONSTRUCTION SITE OF DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Rory enters with a rose pinned to her jacket.]"
"TOM: Hi, Rory."
"RORY: Hi, Tom. How's it going?"
"TOM: Not half bad."
"RORY: Then it's half good."
"TOM: That makes it sound better than it is."
"RORY: Kinda the point."
"TOM: What's with the flower?"
"RORY: It's so my Mom and I will recognize each other."
"TOM: Girl thing?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"TOM: I'm not into girl things."
"RORY: You're a contractor."
"TOM: Yep. Later."
"[Rory spies Dean near a stairwell and approaches him. Dean is wearing full construction gear including a hard hat.]"
"RORY: Oh, excuse me. Can I have your autograph?"
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were one of the Village People."
"DEAN: Ouch. [grinning]"
"RORY: I'm kidding. I'm a kidder."
"DEAN: What are you doing here?"
"RORY: I'm meeting my mom here. We're playing hooky."
"DEAN: The flower's a private joke for her?"
"RORY: You know me well."
"DEAN: Yeah, I do. -- So, um, you okay and all?"
"RORY: Yeah. Oh, that. I'm fine now. A little nervous breakdown can really work wonders for a girl. I didn't mean to lay all that on you."
"DEAN: That's what shoulders are for."
"RORY: Well, you've got a heck of an understanding shoulder."
"DEAN: Hey, you want to hammer something?"
"RORY: Always."
"DEAN: Be my guest. [hands her a hammer]"
"RORY: Really?"
"DEAN: Yeah, Tom went outside. Do it. Go on. [He holds a piece of wooden stair trim for her.]"
"RORY: I feel like I should spit or hike up my shorts or something. [She taps the hammer on the trim.]"
"DEAN: Wow. You're a natural."
"RORY: I think I must have been a carpenter in another life, or just someone who really hated nails."
"[Lindsay and her mother Theresa enter carrying picnic baskets.]"
"LINDSAY: Hi, Rory."
"RORY: Oh, hi, Lindsay."
"DEAN: [approaches and kisses Lindsay] Hi."
"LINDSAY: Are we early?"
"DEAN: No, not at all."
"LINDSAY: Mom and I just wanted to get a nice jump on things today."
"THERESA: Did Lindsay tell you we found a new dry cleaner?"
"DEAN: No."
"THERESA: Tell him, Lindsay!"
"LINDSAY: They use less solvent, so it's cleaner. [to Rory] I'm really into the environment."
"RORY: Oh, me too."
"LINDSAY: So, are you working here?"
"RORY: No, that was illegal hammering. Completely nonunion. Come the revolution, I shall be sh*t."
"THERESA: Let's set up lunch before everything gets cold."
"LINDSAY: Okay [They walk to a nearby table.]"
"RORY: Lunch? This early?"
"THERESA: Our Deano's up at 5:00."
"RORY: Deano?"
"LINDSAY: Don't worry. Mom made lunch today, so it's safe to eat."
"DEAN: Lindsay's mom is teaching her how to cook."
"LINDSAY: It's hard. Do you know how?"
"RORY: If you count radiator quesadillas."
"THERESA: I should have started teaching you sooner. Don't make that mistake with your little one."
"[Both chuckle]"
"RORY: [whispers] Are you...? [Dean shakes his head no and joins Lindsay and Theresa.]"
"[Lorelai enters]"
"LORELAI: Rory? Rory? Rory? [Gasps as she stops before a large, gruff looking construction worker near Rory. To construction worker] Rory! Rory! Rory!"
"RORY: [pretends laughter] Ha ha."
"LORELAI: [to the construction worker] You're never going to attract a man looking like that."
"RORY: Over here, biddy bidster."
"LORELAI: Oh, bye. [approaches Rory and hugs her] Hi. Oh, you wore a rose!"
"RORY: That was the agreement."
"LORELAI: Hey, Lindsay. Hey, Theresa."
"LINDSAY AND THERESA: Hi."
"LORELAI: You ready?"
"RORY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Hey, how often does this happen? [subtly indicating in Lindsay and Theresa's direction]"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it's a hot lunch every day. Plus they always bring something for the group. Yesterday it was peanut brittle Lindsay made. It broke a crown, three teeth, then a HazMat team came and took it away. [exit]"
"CUT TO MALL FOOD COURT"
"[Lorelai and Rory are standing in front of a free-sample-guy eating food on toothpicks.]"
"LORELAI: They put everything on pretzels nowadays. I love that"
"RORY: You're our new best friend, Howard."
"LORELAI: We don't say that to just anybody."
"RORY: Just anybody holding free food."
"LORELAI: We'll be back."
"RORY: Stock up."
"LORELAI: Okay, here we go."
"[They both step onto the up-escalator.]"
"RORY: Where should we start?"
"LORELAI: Well, we're window-shopping, so let's find a window."
"RORY: I see rows and rows of windows."
"LORELAI: Hey, let's walk arm in arm like window-shopping ladies do in movies."
"RORY: You got it."
"LORELAI: I wish I'd brought a xylophone with me. There's always a bouncy xylophone playing when movie girls window-shop. [at top of escalator] So, left or right?"
"RORY: Let's go right."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[They wander past stores with window displays.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, cool."
"RORY: Oh, that would look great on you."
"LORELAI: I love blue."
"RORY: You should make a mental note to get that when you're back in the cash."
"LORELAI: Done."
"RORY: Shall we?"
"LORELAI: Let's shall."
"[They both bump into a window corner.]"
"RORY: Oh, sorry."
"LORELAI: One of the risks of linked-arm walking."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE ENTRANCE OF KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lane approaches front door and sees her mother inside. She knocks.]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane."
"LANE: Hello."
"MRS. KIM: Come in."
"LANE: Thank you."
"LANE: Hello, Aunt Jun."
"AUNT JUN: Hello."
"MRS. KIM: Your Aunt Jun brought your cousin Christine to help with your move. Say hello to Christine."
"LANE: Hello, Christine."
"CHRISTINE: Hello, Lane."
"MRS. KIM: Jun and I will remain down here while you move. You may use whatever boxes you need, plus bubble wrap and tape. Just write down what you take for inventory purposes."
"LANE: I will. Thank you."
"MRS. KIM: You're welcome."
"AUNT JUN: Go with Lane, Christine."
"[Christine silently follows Lane up the stairs to her bedroom, which is in disarray. A soon as Lane shuts the door, Christine begins to speak.]"
"CHRISTINE: [babbles shrilly] I don't believe it! You're moving! What happened? Tell me everything! Was there a fight? Are you getting married? No female Kim has ever moved out without getting married. You're not getting married, right? I love the floorboard thing! It's so ""Hogan's Heroes!"" I wonder if I can pull up the floorboards at my house. Have you heard of the Libertines? What about the White Stripes? Is it over for them? What about Zeppelin? I'm getting more retro. What's a good Zeppelin?"
"[Lane ignores Christine and gathers her belongings.]"
"CHRISTINE: ""II,"" ""III""? ""III""'s got ""Stairway to Heaven,"" right? Man, it's like a funeral down there. I thought my mom was harsh, but your mom makes the guy from Joy Division look like one of the Teletubbies. Are you taking all of this? Is she going through the boxes before you leave? Where do you buy the CDs with the swear words? Did you buy them in disguise? Did someone buy them for you? Have you ever --"
"LANE: Hey Kid, do I look green and wrinkly to you? No? That's right. I'm not Yoda. So if you're looking for a mentor, call the Dalai Lama. What I'm here to do is get my stuff and split. Now be quiet and start assembling boxes. And ""Stairway to Heaven"" is from ""Led Zeppelin IV."" If you're going to get into classic rock, know it, don't blow it! [ Sighs and resumes packing ]"
"CUT TO STAIRWELL"
"[Lane and Christine ddescendthe stairs. Lane carries a large box.]"
"CHRISTINE: [whispering] Do you have a car? Are you getting a car? Do you have a license? Are Kims allowed to drive? I'm dying to drive."
"[Christine is silent again when they enter the room where Mrs. Kim and Jun are sitting.]"
"LANE: [sighs] I left the inventory list in the room."
"MRS. KIM: Very good."
"LANE: I guess I'll be going."
"MRS. KIM: Yes."
"AUNT JUN: Step away from Lane, Christine."
"[Lane and Mrs. Kim look at each other silently. Lane sighs and exits. Mrs. Kim sips her tea as the door closes.]"

"CUT TO MALL"
"[Lorelai and Rory are still walking along outside the stores. They pause before a large window.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's nice."
"RORY: Which?"
"LORELAI: That. [pointing]"
"RORY: The skirt and the blouse?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. More the skirt than the blouse."
"RORY: I like them both."
"LORELAI: Good colors"
"RORY: Oh, they have nice-looking jackets."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: In the back there. [pointing]"
"LORELAI: Oh, cute. [half-heartedly]"
"RORY: Mental note."
"LORELAI: Absolutely. Next window?"
"RORY: Sure."
"LORELAI: Okay, this sucks."
"RORY: Completely."
"LORELAI: This is the least amount of fun I've ever had, barring the time we went to Mummenschanz."
"RORY: Oh, this is way less fun."
"LORELAI: Window-shopping? What was I thinking?"
"RORY: But it sounds fun. It should be fun."
"LORELAI: Not if you think about it. I mean, window-shopping is like going to a museum, but you're actually interested in what you're looking at, and everyone can buy something except for you."
"RORY: I've made so many mental notes in my head of things to get that I think my head has actually gotten bigger."
"LORELAI: Look at all these haughty people with their bags, just rubbing our faces in it. What were Roz Russell and Ava Gardner thinking?"
"RORY: What movie did you see them window-shop in?"
"LORELAI: I don't know that I did. I just picked two old movie-actress names. I don't know that I've seen anyone window-shop in a movie ever."
"RORY: So, this whole outing was a house of sand built on a foundation of straw."
"LORELAI: Hey, maybe if we went in the store, it would be better."
"RORY: Well, it would be way better than just pressing our noses up against the windows."
"[They walk inside a store. Moments later they rush out.]"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Worse!"
"RORY: Much worse."
"LORELAI: Time to pull the plug, hon."
"RORY: But what do we do? It's still morning."
"LORELAI: We could ride the glass elevator up and down."
"RORY: Oh, God, we're sad."
"LORELAI: They've got a merry-go-round."
"RORY: It costs money."
"LORELAI: Right, and we're skint."
"RORY: Plus dirty diapers have touched those seats."
"LORELAI: Well, let's just go somewhere where things are not for sale. Let's be rid of temptation."
"RORY: Sounds good."
"CUT TO TOP OF ESCALATOR"
"[Lorelai and Rory peer downstairs to food court area.]"
"RORY: Do you see Howard?"
"LORELAI: I see Howard, and he's got a fresh batch."
"[They eagerly step onto the escalator.]"
"RORY: I'm looking forward to Howard."
"[Lorelai spots Emily at the bottom of the nearby up escalator. She's riding toward them.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, no."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Emily. [hides her face with hand]"
"RORY: Emily who? [imitates her mother's gesture]"
"LORELAI: ""Emily the Strange"" with the black cat and the boots made for kicking. Who do you think?"
"RORY: Grandma's here? Are you sure?"
"LORELAI: Very sure."
"RORY: Why are we hiding?"
"LORELAI: Reflex."
"RORY: We have to say hello to her."
"LORELAI: Why? We're two ships. We're passing."
"RORY: If she sees us hiding, we're going to have to explain."
"LORELAI: So hide good. [pulls Rory close to hide behind her]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, Rory!"
"LORELAI: Mom, hi."
"RORY: Hi, Grandma."
"EMILY: Meet me up here."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're going down."
"EMILY: Meet me up here!"
"LORELAI: Okay. [They both start to walk up the down escalator.]"
"EMILY: [impatient] Go down, then meet me up here!"
"LORELAI: Right. Coming. Oh, we stink at hiding. [sighs]"
"CUT TO TOP OF ESCALATOR"
"[Lorelai and Rory exit the escalator and approach Emily.]"
"LORELAI AND RORY: Hi. Hi. Wow [weak chuckle]"
"EMILY: What are you doing here? I thought you were both swamped with work."
"LORELAI: Uh, well, yes, well, Rory got a special, uh --"
"RORY: The chancellor gave me a --"
"LORELAI: I actually was able to take --"
"RORY: -- half a day."
"LORELAI: -- a half a day, too. And so we've --"
"RORY: -- just to spend some time."
"LORELAI: We're playing hooky."
"EMILY: Well then, just say that. How long have you been here?"
"LORELAI: Hour and a half."
"EMILY: Where are your bags?"
"RORY: We're just window-shopping."
"EMILY: Window-shopping?"
"LORELAI: Like Roz Russell and Ava Gardner."
"EMILY: What's the fun in that?"
"RORY: There's no fun in that."
"LORELAI: We're thinking of suing Roz and Ava's estates."
"EMILY: Well, come on."
"LORELAI: Oh. Ah. Where?"
"EMILY: Shopping. Come on. Pip-pip. [starts to walk off]"
"LORELAI: Mom, we were just leaving."
"EMILY: You're not leaving. Now, come on."
"LORELAI: I guess we're following my mother."
"RORY: She's very aggressive today."
"LORELAI: I think the passive part of her personality is playing hooky."
"EMILY: [exasperated] Come on!"
"LORELAI: Coming!"
"CUT TO LANE'S NEW APARTMENT"
"[Lane unpacks while Brian sits on the floor. Zach carries boxes inside.]"
"LANE: Hey, did you guys bring silverware or drinking glasses or anything for the kitchen?"
"BRIAN: I didn't."
"LANE: We've no bowls! We have no cups! [opens a kitchen cabinet and gasps ] But we do have a him."
"ZACH: Him? Him who?"
"BRIAN: There's a him in one of the cupboards?"
"LANE: An ex-him, to be exact. He's belly-up. He was a big boy, too. A big, fat, belly-up big boy."
"[Zach drops a box on top of a pile.]"
"BRIAN: Hey, watch it. That's my stereo!"
"ZACH: We didn't need your stereo, Brian. We've got my stereo."
"LANE: We've got three stereos and no forks. [exits to another room]"
"BRIAN: We're kind of lacking in shelf space."
"ZACH: Well, maybe you should skip displaying your Futurama action figures. That might open space up a bit."
"LANE: [returns in a panic] There are no curtains on the windows! People can see right in."
"BRIAN: What if we're naked?"
"ZACH: Please, never be naked."
"BRIAN: I try not to be."
"LANE: And how can there be no refrigerator?"
"BRIAN: There's no refrigerator?"
"LANE: I just assumed there'd be one!"
"ZACH: Great, so it's back to the Middle Ages for us. Let's start storing meat in stocks of salt."
"LANE: Is that someone looking in? [exits again]"
"[Brian plugs something into the light socket.]"
"ZACH: What's that?"
"BRIAN: It's a night light."
"ZACH: Dude, when the Sex p*stol roomed together, no way did they have a night light."
"BRIAN: You don't know that."
"ZACH: I read Johnny Rotten's book. There's no mention of a night light."
"LANE: [returns to room] Towels! I don't have towels. [holds up a pitiful washcloth] I've got this. This is not gonna work."
"ZACH: Hey, when you said you had a bed for me, you didn't say it would be bunk beds."
"BRIAN: But they're cool. The bottom one's like a fort."
"ZACH: We're not playing fort."
"LANE: We've got to start a list. Anyone have paper or a pen or money?"
"ZACH: Dude, look, this is my side of the shelf. Your stuff's encroaching."
"BRIAN: It's not encroaching."
"ZACH: Bender and Leela are on my side. Put them back on your side."
"BRIAN: That's not Bender. That's Nibbler. Bender's a robot."
"ZACH: Are you remotely aware that you're not twelve?"
"BRIAN: They're on my side!"
"ZACH: They're on my side, dude. Move them."
"LANE: Guys, stop! Look down. There's a whole empty shelf for you to use, so you can stop bickering."
"BRIAN: But we put that aside for you."
"LANE: What?"
"ZACH: For your CDs and stuff. You need a shelf, Lane."
"[After a short pause Lane hugs them both.]"
"BRIAN: Jeez. You smeared my glasses."
"LANE: [grateful tears] This is gonna work, one step at a time."
"ZACH: Listen, we set aside a shelf for you in the john, too. You don't need to hug us for that."
"CUT TO MALL DEPARTMENT STORE"
"[Lorelai and Rory rush to keep pace with Emily.]"
"LORELAI: [sighs] Uh, Mom, where the fire?"
"EMILY: We have a lot to get through."
"[A sales girl approaches them.]"
"SALES GIRL: Mrs. Gilmore, did I know you were coming?"
"EMILY: Not unless you're clairvoyant."
"SALES GIRL: What are we looking for today?"
"EMILY: What are we not looking for? This is my daughter, Lorelai, and my granddaughter, Rory."
"SALES GIRL: Nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"RORY: Hi."
"EMILY: What's new? I want a full report."
"SALES GIRL: We have a china set that just arrived still in its crate that screams ""Emily Gilmore."""
"EMILY: Hand-painted?"
"SALES GIRL: Designed in 1870 for the Shah of Persia -- the finest. Would you like to see it?"
"EMILY: No need. Give me a set of twelve. Plus soup tureens, sauce boats, the works. What else?"
"SALES GIRL: Doreen. [calling out to approaching woman who joins them keeping brisk pace]"
"EMILY: That's gorgeous. [glancing at a glass ornament]"
"SALES GIRL: From Giorgio Baldi's studio in Venice. They only made eighteen."
"EMILY: Wrap them up."
"SALES GIRL: Right away. [exits]"
"[Emily stops short in the aisle. Lorelai slams into her back.]"
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Your brake lights were out."
"EMILY: You! [calling out to salesman] You've got Richard Gilmore's sizes on file. Pull the latest Brionis in an assortment of colors and charge them to our account."
"SALESMAN: Yes, ma'am."
"RORY: [to Lorelai] What are Brionis?"
"LORELAI: Six months of my car payments, plus a car."
"EMILY: Include accessories and three pairs of loafers -- Italian. They should feel like butter. Make it four. Hell, make it six."
"SALESMAN: Yes, ma'am."
"EMILY: And jewelry. Add an assortment of jewelry appropriate for a man with a moustache. What would that be? Bracelets, pinkie rings?"
"SALESMAN: Well…"
"EMILY: And a moustache comb -- the most expensive one you've got."
"SSALESMAN I will look. Excuse me. [rushes off]"
"LORELAI: Uh, Mom - [hurrying to keep pace]"
"EMILY: Keep up."
"LORELAI: Does Dad even want any of this stuff?"
"EMILY: He doesn't know what he wants, Lorelai, so I choose what he wants."
"LORELAI: Excuse me. [stopping in front of display]"
"SECOND SALESMAN: Yes?"
"EMILY: I want this."
"SECOND SALESMAN: I'm sorry, ma'am, that is just a display. It's not for sale."
"EMILY: Everything's for sale."
"SECOND SALESMAN: I will take care of it. [exits]"
"LORELAI: Mom, Dad does not need another globe."
"EMILY: Then Rory can have it. She can use a globe. [keeps walking]"
"RORY: It doesn't even have the right countries on it."
"LORELAI: C'mon."
"RORY: Or California."
"[They walk through the store to the women's accessories department.]"
"EMILY: Start picking!"
"LORELAI: Start picking what?"
"EMILY: Everything, anything!"
"LORELAI: Mom, we don't have any money."
"EMILY: It's on your father."
"RORY: But, Grandma --"
"EMILY: [beckons nearby salesgirl] Some help, please.[snaps fingers] You like hats?"
"RORY: Uh, kind of."
"[A third Sales girl approaches.]"
"EMILY: That one. Put it on her."
"LORELAI: Ooh. [giggles]"
"EMILY: I like it. These scarves all match, and of course you'll need gloves. We'll take them all. [walks on]"
"LORELAI: Hey, see those marbles rolling on the floor? They're Mom's. They spilled out of her head."
"RORY: I do like the chapeau."
"LORELAI: Do not get sucked in! This is craziness!"
"RORY: It's just a hat."
"LORELAI: It's a symbol."
"RORY: We don't know what it's symbolizing. Resist."
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"[Lorelai joins Emily at the fine jewelry counter.]"
"EMILY: You need a watch."
"LORELAI: I don't wear a watch."
"EMILY: Do you have a watch?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Then you need a watch. [to saleswoman] These don't have diamonds. Which ones have diamonds?"
"WOMAN: Next display."
"LORELAI: Mom, I'm not buying a diamond watch."
"EMILY: You just have to take it."
"LORELAI: I'm not taking it."
"EMILY: I'm buying you a damn watch! [glances in the glass display case and points] That one. Wrap it up."
"LORELAI: [to saleswoman] Can I return the damn watch if I don't want it?"
"WOMAN: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Thank you. [She glances at Rory in the distance - being fussed over.]"
"CUT TO OTHER PART OF STORE"
"[Lorelai and Rory trail behind Emily.]"
"LORELAI: Are you keeping track?"
"RORY: I lost count."
"LORELAI: She bought me four cocktail dresses, two evening gowns, and if I'm not mistaken, eight maids a-milking."
"RORY: By the way, she bought you a wedding dress when you weren't looking. Vera Wang."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you stop her?"
"RORY: Well how do you stop a top from spinning around?"
"LORELAI: This is too much."
"EMILY: Girls, come on. Keep up."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Stop dawdling and start picking some shoes."
"LORELAI: Mom --"
"EMILY: These Manolo Blahniks would look great on you."
"[Lorelai's expression changes to interest]"
"LORELAI: [imitating Gollum] Oh, me wants them, my precious."
"RORY: You told me to resist."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but that's before I saw these. These are works of art. They should be in the Louvre."
"CUT TO EMILY AND SALES GIRL"
"SALES GIRL: Mrs Gilmore, I'm sorry. We only four of the Venetian apples in. If you want the rest, we can have them shipped."
"EMILY: Well, give me the four today and ship the rest overnight whatever the cost."
"SALES GIRL: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Mom, a quick word."
"EMILY: Where are your shoes?"
"LORELAI: Wait. What is the rush on the funny glass apples?"
"EMILY: They're not funny, and I want them. That's the rush."
"LORELAI: Yes, but you've already put quite a dent in your credit card for things you don't seem to need."
"EMILY: So?"
"LORELAI: So it's crazy."
"EMILY: Crazy? You think this is crazy? [voice gets louder]"
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom --"
"EMILY This isn't crazy!"
"LORELAI: I didn't mean to --"
"EMILY: That stupid moustache is crazy! That's what's crazy! Your father's job is crazy! That's what's crazy! He was supposed to be slowing down, and now he's club-hopping with Jason and hanging out with Moby and having secret lunches with women and lying about it!"
"LORELAI: Mom, Calm down."
"EMILY: Why should I calm down? Are you on his side? Do you like that moustache?"
"LORELAI: I'm not taking sides."
"EMILY: I should go to bars! I should hang out with Moby! He'd hate that."
"LORELAI: Mom, I'm just suggesting that you slow down on the shopping. This doesn't have to be a whole big thing."
"EMILY: Why do I need to slow down? This is what I do, according to Richard. And he's not slowing down. He's got a whole new life. He's got Pennilyn Lott, he's got Digger, he's got a moustache! He's got all that and what do I have? Maybe I should get a job so I can have my own life. I could sell shoes here just as well Eduardo. I should get an application. [Calls out loudly] Get me an application! Go, go!"
"LORELAI: Mom --"
"EMILY: I hate that moustache, and he refuses to shave it!"
"LORELAI: Mom, let's take a break."
"EMILY: I don't want to take a break!"
"LORELAI: Well, we do, and my feet are k*ll me."
"EMILY: Well, then get some new shoes!"
"LORELAI: Come on."
"CUT TO MALL FOOD COURT"
"EMILY: Where are we going?"
"LORELAI: Right around the corner here."
"EMILY: We really should have taken our bags."
"LORELAI: They said they'd hold them."
"EMILY: I'm totally turned around. Where are we?"
"RORY: You'll smell in a second."
"EMILY: [gasps] What is this?"
"RORY: It's the food court."
"EMILY: How long has this been here?"
"LORELAI: You've never been to the food court, Mom?"
"EMILY: No."
"RORY: Where do you eat when you shop?"
"EMILY: I leave and go to a restaurant."
"LORELAI: With this Valhalla of international cuisine so close?"
"EMILY: But it's cafeteria-style."
"RORY: That's the fun."
"LORELAI: Here. Best table in the house."
"EMILY: It's plastic."
"RORY: Plastic is a vital part of our bright tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Soon we'll all be living in plastic houses."
"RORY: On the moon."
"EMILY: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: We're pulling your leg, Grandma."
"EMILY: Well don't do that."
"LORELAI: So what are you in the mood for?"
"EMILY: I don't know."
"RORY: I want Mexican."
"LORELAI: I kind of feel like Moroccan and Chinese."
"RORY: So smorgasbord."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Come on."
"EMILY: Wait. Here. [tries to hand Lorelai a credit card]"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, Mom. Moe's Moroccan Palace does not take credit cards."
"EMILY: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: It's on us. [to Rory] Keep an eye on her. Make sure she doesn't wander off."
"CUT TO MINUTES LATER IN FOOD COURT"
"[Lorelai and Rory approach the table, each carrying a food tray. A mall employee trails behind them with more trays.]"
"LORELAI: [cell phone to her ear] The ad cannot run with the color composition the way it is. The drawing of the inn looks purple. [pause] Yes, I know, but I'm not paying for it looking like that. I do understand. It looks awful. [pause] Fine. Have him call me. I would love to sort it out. Okay? Thank you. Bye. [hangs up] Sorry."
"[They join Emily sitting at the table.]"
"EMILY: What is all this?"
"RORY: It's lunch. Thanks, Lou. [he exits]"
"LORELAI: I got a little something from everywhere."
"EMILY: I wouldn't know where to begin."
"LORELAI: Well, start at the top and stop when you hit table."
"EMILY: I had no idea so many different kinds of foods came on sticks."
"RORY: Well, some come on sticks, like the hot dogs and the fried cheese dipped in batter, but others are technically kabobs."
"EMILY: What's in the cups?"
"LORELAI: Well, you got your soda, your iced tea, root beer, lemonade."
"EMILY: I'll try this."
"LORELAI: Ah, Orange Julius."
"RORY: A classic."
"EMILY: Oh, my. That's very good. Your father and I know a man who owns a couple dozen of these stands as part of his holdings. Now I can sincerely tell him I like his product."
"LORELAI: Excellent."
"RORY: Oh, we forgot napkins. [stands up]"
"LORELAI: Get some more little pepper thingies, please. So dig in, Mom. You've got sweet-and-sour pork and pizza and some wrapped thingy. I already forgot what it is, but it's probably not healthy."
"EMILY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Oh, and there's ice cream, too. We can get some after if you want."
"EMILY: All right. So how loud was I back there?"
"LORELAI: Well, uh, you were heard."
"EMILY: If I had seen somebody act that way in a store, I would have called security."
"LORELAI: It's really okay, Mom. It wasn't that loud. It's totally forgotten. [Her cell phone rings and Lorelai snatches up impatiently.] Oh! Do not disturb. I'm eating. [hangs up]"
"EMILY: What was that phone call you got before, when you were coming over with the trays?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it's this ad we're doing for the inn. The drawing of the inn came out purple, like eggplant, like Prince chose the color. It was bad."
"EMILY: Sounds awful."
"LORELAI: It was their screw-up. Just one of the many joyous things I get to deal with on a daily basis."
"EMILY: You were very forceful."
"LORELAI: Was I?"
"EMILY: Very in command. I like how you handled it."
"LORELAI: Well, I learned from the best."
"EMILY: From whom?"
"LORELAI: From the lady eating her hamburger with a knife and fork. That's whom."
"EMILY: Oh, please. I order maids and salespeople around. That's different. I've never done anything."
"LORELAI: Mom, come on. That's not true."
"EMILY: Richard's right. I buy things. Things I don't even want. It's all I have."
"LORELAI: No, Mom, you have friends and family who love being with you. A-and you have a house you love. You have a whole life. You could have a dog if you want. There's a swell pet store here. You're losing perspective, Mom. You're not seeing clearly."
"EMILY: If he would just shave that moustache."
"LORELAI: And that's all it would take? Shaving his moustache? Mom, you need to talk to him."
"EMILY: He's always so distracted."
"LORELAI: No. Make him talk. You need it. And make it a real talk without bickering, without snipping, without mentioning Moby. Really clear the air."
"[Rory approaches and sits]"
"RORY: I got pepper, I got napkins, I got Lou's phone number. He asked me to give it to you."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm privileged."
"RORY: What'd I miss?"
"EMILY: I was just admiring your mother's life."
"RORY: Oh, I do that daily."
"[They all smile thoughtfully and eat in silence.]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK AT NIGHT"
"[Luke walks down the sidewalk, pausing to watch Kirk taping signs to light posts.]"
"KIRK:[gasps] Oh, God! Oh, God!"
"[Luke enters Joe's Game Gallery]"
"LUKE: Hey, Joe."
"JOE: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Can I get twenty singles off you?"
"JOE: Sure. It's gonna cost you $25. [ Chuckles - Luke doesn't react] It's change humor."
"LUKE: I know. You do it every time."
"JOE: I'll get them for you. [he exits]"
"LUKE: Thanks. [approaches Dean at video game]"
"DEAN: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Hi, Dean."
"DEAN: Wait. Hold on. [after a moment game ends] Aw."
"LUKE: No, you did good."
"JOE: Short of your record, though, Dean."
"DEAN: Yeah, I'll get there."
"JOE: He's the reigning champ of every game in here."
"LUKE: Wow!"
"DEAN: I'm not here that much. I just come after dinner sometimes, y'know. Lindsay and her mom kind of like me out of the way when they're cleaning up."
"LUKE: They kick you out, huh?"
"DEAN: I just slip out. They don't really notice."
"LUKE: So how's married life treating you?"
"DEAN: Good. Real good. Lindsay's great."
"LUKE: Yeah, she seems great."
"DEAN: And her parents are fantastic. I mean, they help out so much."
"LUKE: Like with the cleaning up."
"DEAN: Her dad's over all the time, fixing things. Lindsay's got this list for him to do."
"LUKE: Great."
"DEAN: They're the most unselfish people I know."
"LUKE: I've seen them around. The dad works for the county, doesn't he? He's a surveyor or something?"
"DEAN: Yeah. Oh. He, uh, he used to. But I think now he... [Dean becomes distracted when he notices Rory and Lorelai outside the window.] I think he's, um...actually, he manages an apartment, so he oversees the guys, and he's not really, um..."
"[Luke looks over his shoulder to see why Dean is distracted.]"
"LUKE: Not surveying much."
"DEAN: Yeah, he's not in the field much."
"LUKE: Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your game."
"DEAN: Yeah. Hey, uh, see you later, man."
"[Joe approaches and hands Luke the singles.]"
"LUKE: Thanks. [exits]"
"[Dean sighs.]"
"CUT TO INTERIOR OF LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke enters and sees Lorelai and Rory sitting at a table with loads of merchandise strewn atop.]"
"Luke: [sighs] What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Taking inventory."
"RORY: We should return it all."
"LORELAI: Mom's gonna expect to see us with something she bought us. We have to keep something."
"RORY: Seven hundred dollar yoga bag?"
"LUKE: Get out of here."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, my friend, rich people like their sweaty mats to have expensive homes."
"RORY: We could each keep a little clutch purse."
"LORELAI: What's that tubey one for?"
"RORY: Lifesavers."
"LORELAI: The candy?"
"RORY: Yep."
"LUKE: Get out of here."
"RORY: Turquoise leather jacket?"
"LORELAI: Hm, pass. Hair clips with diamond Betty Boops?"
"RORY: Pass. Tropical-print embroidered bikini?"
"LORELAI: Not me. [holds it up to show Luke] Luke?"
"LUKE: This is sick."
"LORELAI: This I'll take. [holds up florescent totebag]"
"RORY: Oh, no. I have dibs on that."
"LORELAI: In your mind."
"RORY: I said it in the store."
"LORELAI: Yeah and I said it, too. And I clutched it. It still has my clutch marks."
"RORY: You do realize that the one thing we're fighting over is the free tote bag that came with our purchase."
"LORELAI: It's a nice totebag"
"LUKE: I'm upset just watching this."
"LORELAI: This is your window on a whole other world, Luke. The world of worthless rich-people stuff. People of means see what they want and simply take it, regardless of others."
"LUKE: You pour your own coffee?"
"LORELAI: Oh, err, yeah."
"LUKE: You're not supposed to do that."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah [sheepish] sorry, I won't do it again. [takes a gulp]"
"LUKE: Um-hm."
"[A dog yelps outside. They look out the window and see Kirk taping up signs. Then Kirk enters the diner, carrying a small shaggy dog.]"
"KIRK: Does anyone know who this is?"
"LORELAI: No."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's Snuggles."
"LORELAI: You know Snuggles?"
"KIRK: It's not Snuggles. It's the dog that looks like Snuggles. Snuggles' owner picked him up. No one picked this guy up and he has no tag."
"LUKE: You have a dog left over."
"LORELAI: You knew Snuggles by name?"
"KIRK: I don't have time for chitchat here, people!"
"LUKE: I have no idea whose dog it is."
"LORELAI: Me either."
"RORY: Sorry."
"KIRK: I don't even know his name. I was using random sounds, trying to see if he'd respond. Paku. Gnocchi. Nini. Bleeblo. Nothing."
"LUKE: Sorry. [walks off]"
"KIRK: I've got to put up more flyers. Sunna. Lipdoo. Funo. [exits]"
"LORELAI: [sighs] Thank God. I'm so tired."
"RORY: Me too, and I have to get back to Yale."
"LORELAI: I had a great time today."
"RORY: So did I."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. We should make this a regular part of our weekly schedule?"
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: So next Tuesday?"
"RORY: Tuesday's good. Oh, sh**t. I can't. Wednesday?"
"LORELAI: Uh, sure. I'll have to cancel plans with Jason."
"RORY: Don't cancel plans with Jason. Dumb me, I've got class that night anyway."
"LORELAI: All right. Skip ahead a week."
"RORY: I hate that we have to schedule time like this."
"LORELAI: But if we don't, we don't see each other, right?"
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: So what about the weekend?"
"RORY: I'll be at Friday night dinner at Grandma's."
"LORELAI: Great. I won't. Not this one. Darn."
"RORY: Uh-huh."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Hey, you want pie?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: 'Cause I'm getting my second wind. [walks to counter]"
"RORY: Me too. Let's have pie."
"LORELAI: [calls out] Hey, Luke, we're having pie. [She removes the pie's glass cover and starts removing slices.]"
"LUKE: [calls from the kitchen] Okay, just wait for me to serve it."
"LORELAI: Okay. [She continues removing a second slice onto napkins.]"
"RORY: Should we be worried about Grandma?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I think she'll be okay."
"[Lorelai returns to the table with pie.]"
"RORY: Was anything resolved? Are she and Grandpa gonna be all right?"
"LORELAI: Don't worry about it. They're a team. They'll be okay."
"RORY: Good. I like them. [begins eating with fingers]"
"LORELAI: I know. [takes a bite]"
"[Luke brings plates and forks transfers napkins to plates]"
"RORY: Thanks"
"[Lorelai pulls out her rosebud and hands it to Luke. While they resume eating, Luke walks away sniffing the rose.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE DINING ROOM"
"[Richard and Emily are eating together in their usual places at opposite ends of the table. The room is silent with the exception of a big clock ticking in the background.]"
"RICHARD: Did you deal with that business with the gardeners?"
"EMILY: Not yet."
"RICHARD: Hmm. We need to resolve that. Those vines are out of control."
"EMILY: I'll see to it."
"RICHARD: Be nice to have that finished by the time I get back."
"EMILY: Get back? From where?"
"RICHARD: Jason and I are meeting some clients in Manhattan. It's some new place downtown -- Tribeca, I think. It's really an up-and-coming area. I'll probably stay in the city, take the train in the morning. Is that all right with you?"
"EMILY: That's fine. [long pause] What do you think of these? [indicates table arrangements]"
"RICHARD: Hmm?"
"EMILY: The apples."
"RICHARD: Oh. I've always liked those."
"[After a long pause Emily resumes eating.]"

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The four Gilmores are seated at the table. The maid serves dinner.]"
"LORELAI: Don't tell me this is what it looks like."
"EMILY: It's escargot."
"LORELAI: Ugh. That's what it looks like."
"RORY: Snails?"
"EMILY: Escargot."
"LORELAI: Slimy thing by any other name..."
"RICHARD: They taste like garlic and butter."
"LORELAI: Don't say ""they."" Food should not have pronouns."
"RICHARD: Give it a try."
"LORELAI: But if I do and we're having road k*ll for the main course, then I will already have used up my allotment of gross-out food for the day, so I'll abstain."
"RICHARD: I guess we should strike escargot off the list of Friday night dinner foods."
"EMILY: Sweetie loved escargot. That's funny how we remember those things."
"RICHARD: Hm."
"LORELAI: Sweetie?"
"RORY: Sweetie who?"
"EMILY: Sweetie Nelson, one of my oldest friends. She passed away yesterday."
"RORY: Oh, I'm sorry, Grandma."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I've heard you mention her."
"RORY: Was she sick?"
"EMILY: She'd been ill for some time, but still..."
"RICHARD: The family is pretty overwhelmed."
"EMILY: By the way, Davis called late today. The funeral is going to be Sunday."
"LORELAI: Was that her real name -- Sweetie?"
"EMILY: No, her name was Melinda. Sweetie was a nickname."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"EMILY: What do you mean, why?"
"LORELAI: I mean, how did they get Sweetie from Melinda?"
"EMILY: They didn't get Sweetie from Melinda. Sweetie is a nickname."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know Sweetie was a nickname, but usually, a nickname comes from a version of your name, or there's a story behind the name or something."
"EMILY: She was sweet. That's the story."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: She had a very sweet nature."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"EMILY: Well, what kind of story did you want, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: No, that's fine. She was sweet. They called her Sweetie. It's a good story."
"EMILY: No, really. Exactly what kind of story about my recently departed friend would amuse you?"
"LORELAI: Mom, it's not to amuse me. It's --"
"EMILY: All right, fine. Sweetie's father was a very poor man -- so poor that Sweetie and her four siblings all had to sleep in a hollowed-out tree trunk because the house was only big enough for their parents. One winter, there was no food, so Sweetie crawled out of her trunk, wrapped her feet in newspaper, and walked forty miles in the snow to the nearest town, where she stumbled into a candy store. The owner took pity on her and gave her bags of candy, a dill pickle, and drove her back to her family. He promptly offered a job to her father, who gladly accepted and eventually owned that store and turned it into one of the most important candy emporiums in the world. And that is how she got the name Sweetie. There, how was that?"
"LORELAI: Now, that was a pretty good story."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, Emily, did you say the funeral is Sunday?"
"EMILY: Yes. Is that a problem?"
"RICHARD: Well, Mr. Hamoto is in town, and Jason has set up golf for him, and then there's lunch after that. What time is the service?"
"EMILY: Noon."
"RICHARD: Oh, noon. That's cutting it very close. How important is it for me to be at the funeral?"
"EMILY: Not important at all."
"RICHARD: Well, fine, then. Be sure to give them my condolences."
"EMILY: Of course. Eat your food."
"LORELAI: [Gasps] I think one of them is still alive."
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: No, seriously. He was over near the radish like five minutes ago."
"[Opening Credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lane is serving customers.]"
"KIRK: This doesn't smell right."
"LANE: Smells fine, Kirk."
"KIRK: I think the eggs were bad."
"LANE: The eggs are fine, Kirk."
"KIRK: Were they cooked in the fish pan? They smell like they were cooked in the fish pan."
"LANE: No, the eggs were not cooked in the fish pan. They were cooked in the egg pan."
"KIRK: Was the fish pan sitting next to the egg pan? Because perhaps -"
"[Lorelai walks in the door.]"
"LORELAI: I need something with cheese!"
"KIRK: Lorelai, smell my eggs."
"LORELAI: Not today, Kirk. Hey, where's Luke? I want him to make that breakfast quesadilla thing he made yesterday."
"LANE: Luke's not here."
"LORELAI: Where is he? He knows the exact right jack-to-cheddar ratio."
"KIRK: He's out there. [Kirk points out the window.]"
"LORELAI: Where?"
"KIRK: Over there with Nicole."
"LORELAI: Oh, looks like a serious talk."
"KIRK: And there have been zero light moments."
"LORELAI: I wish I knew what they were talking about."
"KIRK: Oh, I can tell you what they're saying."
"LORELAI: How?"
"KIRK: I read lips. My girlfriend taught me. It's so we can have quiet time and keep the conversation going at the same time. Okay, she just said, ""Hardwood sponge is the authority of the hostile biographer."" And then he responded, ""Just phone cords to original samovars."""
"LORELAI: Kirk, that doesn't make any sense."
"KIRK: Must mean they're on to us and they've switched to some sort of code."
"LORELAI: I don't think they're speaking in code."
"KIRK: Oh, I think Luke's heading back. He just got up and said, ""Feel your taters."""
"LORELAI: Is it possible he said, ""I'll see you later?"""
"KIRK: No, I'm pretty sure about this one."
"LANE: Kirk, I'm so sorry, we accidentally made the eggs in the fish pan. Here's new eggs."
"KIRK: I don't know why everybody in this town always thinks I'm crazy."
"CUT TO YALE NEWSROOM"
"RORY: You've got to be kidding."
"DOYLE: I certainly am not kidding. This is serious."
"RORY: It's not plagiarism."
"DOYLE: Hey! Do you also like to shout ""fire"" in a crowded theater? This is a newsroom. Do not use the ""p"" word."
"RORY: Every single word in my piece was written by me."
"DOYLE: Was it? Look at this. ""Small band of followers."" ""Rain-soaked highway."" I've seen both of those before."
"RORY: Of course you've seen them before. Those are phrases used to talk about a small band of followers or, you know, a rain-soaked highway. They're not even clichés like ""shouting fire in a crowded theater."""
"DOYLE: I'm sorry, can you say ""Stephen Glass?"" The entire climate of journalistic ethics is under a microscope right now. We can't afford anything that looks shady. I'd rather not have Tobey Maguire playing me in a movie about the Yale Daily News scandal, thank you very much."
"RORY: I get that, but I don't think my ""rain-soaked highway"" looks shady."
"DOYLE: [Scoffs] Typical. It's your attitude."
"RORY: What attitude?"
"DOYLE: Look around this room. People writing their anthro papers on our computers, people Xeroxing their phone bills on our copy machines. No one's running, no one's sweating. Every single person in this room looks extremely well-rested. No one spell-checks. No one fact-checks. This is the breeding ground for the next Jayson Blair! Fix it. And tidy up your desk!"
"[Doyle stomps away.]"
"GLENN: And my month is up."
"RORY: What?"
"GLENN: You're the new dog to kick around here. I feel bad, 'cause you tend to be a pretty decent person, but my nose has been whacked with a newspaper so many times this month, it almost makes me miss my mother."
"RORY: Doyle's just in a bad mood, that's all."
"DOYLE: ""Herd mentality?"" Are you freaking kidding me?!"
"GLENN: Welcome to the dollhouse."
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the table going over paperwork. Michel is seated on the floor in front of the TV.]"
"LORELAI: Michel, come on, we've got to get into these budgets."
"SOOKIE: Now."
"MICHEL: Does the red light mean it's programmed?"
"SOOKIE: I explained it a hundred times."
"LORELAI: Michel, you've been setting that machine for 20 minutes now."
"SOOKIE: The man can't live without his dog show."
"MICHEL: Ugh. I could just k*ll my cable provider. ""No Westminster dog show, but please enjoy Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle 24 hours a day."" Ah, there, it's recording."
"LORELAI: Well, get over here."
"MICHEL: I just want to see the Chows. [Laughs] Look at that one strut. [Baby talk to the TV.] You know you're a pretty girl, don't you? Yes, with those ""I need some loving"" eyes."
"SOOKIE: Is he doing tricks?"
"LORELAI: It sounds like they're turning them. [Lorelai's cell phone rings.] Hello."
"EMILY: Lorelai, it's me. Do you have a moment?"
"LORELAI: Uh, sure."
"EMILY: Your grandmother. She's gone."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Last night. She apparently had a heart attack. The maid found her in the morning."
"LORELAI: But I didn't even know her heart was a thing. Was her heart a thing? Did we know that?"
"EMILY: No, it was quite unexpected. There wasn't any warning at all."
"LORELAI: But we just - we just saw her."
"EMILY: I know. It's a complete shock."
"LORELAI: Ohh. I -- how is Dad?"
"EMILY: He's completely fallen apart. From the moment he heard the news, he's been almost incoherent."
"LORELAI: Oh, no."
"EMILY: He's in his office now with the Scotch, and he wants turtleneck soup -- asks for it over and over."
"LORELAI: What's turtleneck soup?"
"EMILY: Apparently something his mother used to have made for him when he was a little boy, and now he wants some, and I can't seem to find anybody who has any idea what it is."
"MICHEL: All right, the pugs are up next. They're ugly. Let's do this."
"LORELAI: [Whispers to Michel] My grandmother."
"SOOKIE: [Whispers] Heart attack -- grandmother."
"MICHEL: [Whispers] What?"
"LORELAI: Dead grandmother, Michel. Mom, have you looked on the internet?"
"EMILY: For what?"
"LORELAI: For turtleneck soup. You could Google it."
"EMILY: Can I? Can I Google it?"
"LORELAI: Okay, never mind. Sookie, do you have any idea what turtleneck soup could be?"
"EMILY: You mean mock turtle soup?"
"LORELAI: Mom, do you think he means ""mock turtle soup?"""
"EMILY: Maybe that's what he said. Is there such a thing?"
"LORELAI: I think so. [to Sookie] Can you make mock turtle soup?"
"SOOKIE: I never tried, but I think I have a recipe for it somewhere here."
"LORELAI: So, Mom, Sookie's tracking down the soup. What else can I do?"
"EMILY: Nothing. If you can find the soup, that'll be enough. You'll tell Rory?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'll tell Rory."
"EMILY: All right, I have to go. Your grandmother left very specific instructions on exactly how she wants her funeral to be, so I have a hundred things to do."
"LORELAI: I'll be there with the soup as soon as I can, Mom."
"EMILY: All right, bye."
"LORELAI: Bye. [Hangs up] I'm gonna have to go."
"SOOKIE: No problem. One huge vat of mock turtle soup coming up."
"MICHELL: Do you need a hug?"
"LORELAI: Thanks, I'm okay. I have to call Rory. You'll call me when the soup's ready?"
"SOOKIE: I'm on it."
"LORELAI: Have to go. Michel, you'll take care of the papers and the landscaping plans?"
"MICHEL: Yes, I will. Go, go."
"LORELAI: Okay. Purse, coat, keys. I'm gone. Michel?"
"MICHEL: Yes?"
"LORELAI: [Sighs] I think I'll take that hug now. [They hug then step back.] A little weird, huh?"
"MICHEL: Yeah, extremely."
"LORELAI: Heart in the right place, but never again?"
"MICHEL: Thank God."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily is on the phone.]"
"EMILY: Yes, I understand the reverend's retired. You said that four times. But my mother-in-law specifically requested him for the service, and… [The doorbell rings.] Well, isn't there any forwarding information?"
"[Emily opens the door for Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: I got the soup."
"EMILY: Well, I will hold while you look. [to Lorelai] Thank God. He's in his study. Take that into him and see if you can get him to eat. [to person on the phone] Yes, I'm still here. Miraculous, isn't it? A phone number! How…"
"[Lorelai goes into Richard's study. He's lying on the leather couch with a drink in his hand.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, dad."
"RICHARD: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, uh...I have something for you. Mock turtle soup."
"RICHARD: Mock turtle soup?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Sookie made it."
"RICHARD: Mock turtle soup. [ Chuckling ] Mock turtle soup. [ Voice breaking ] Mock turtle soup. [ Crying ] Mock turtle soup."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, soup's gone. No soup here. Who mentioned soup? This is definitely a no-soup zone. Uh, the music's nice."
"RICHARD: Oh, she loved Kay Kyser. She wasn't really a musical woman. Music was a little frivolous for her. But Kay Kyser."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Well, she's great."
"RICHARD: Kay Kyser's a man."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, his parents had an ugly sense of humor then. [Richard sobs.] Oh, boy."
"RICHARD: She was a saint -- the woman was a saint."
"LORELAI: Here, Dad."
"RICHARD: I learned everything from that woman. ""Life is a battle, and you either enter it armed or you surrender immediately."" That is what she told me...on my 10th birthday. I never forgot that. No, no one...was as strong as that woman. That wonderful woman...that saint of a woman."
"LORELAI: Oh, Dad."
"RICHARD: Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. I -- I just have to deal with this... [Sighs] regret."
"LORELAI: What regret? Dad, you and Gran were so close."
"RICHARD: The last words we exchanged, we exchanged in anger."
"LORELAI: Oh, but, dad, that's -"
"RICHARD: I lost my temper and I was disrespectful. And that's the way -- that's the way it ended. With an argument and hateful words."
"LORELAI: Dad, you know, that was one little fight. I mean, one little fight between you and Gran doesn't wipe away years of -"
"RICHARD: That woman raised me and she taught me. And she took care of the family even after Father died. And I spoke her as if I owed her nothing, as if she was like anyone else in the world and not the saint of a woman that she was."
"LORELAI: Oh, Dad."
"RICHARD: You only have one set of parents, Lorelai. Remember that. I forgot and now I have to live with that for the rest of my life. [ Sighs ] You mentioned soup."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: When you came in."
"LORELAI: Yes, soup. I have soup. Um, Mom mentioned that you were talking about mock turtle soup and you really should eat something, Dad."
"RICHARD: I need a spoon."
"LORELAI: Oh, my Go-- yes, I'll get you a spoon. I'll get you -- you just sit right there. I'll be right back with your spoon."
"[Lorelai goes back out to the living room where Emily is on the phone.]"
"EMILY: [talking on the phone] But it used to be Martelli's Florist, yes? Okay, do you have any idea where Martelli's moved to? Oh, well, before he died, did Mr. Martelli pass his trade on to any of the other Martellis? Yes, I'll hold. [to Lorelai] How is he doing?"
"LORELAI: He needs a spoon."
"EMILY: He's going to eat?"
"LORELAI: He's going to eat."
"EMILY: Thank God. Take an apple. See if you can get him to eat an apple. [into the phone] I'm here. Yes, I will take the simple stepson's number. Thank you. I will speak slowly. Thank you. [hangs up] Not that one. And take some bread, too."
"LORELAI: How are the arrangements coming?"
"EMILY: Well, she made them twenty years ago, so the reverend is retired, the florist has moved, and two of the pallbearers are no longer with us. Luckily, they both had sons who look remarkably like them, so I think we can get away with it."
"LORELAI: All right, I'm gonna bring this stuff to Dad."
"EMILY: I'm going to call the florist's idiot stepson."
"RICHARD: Emily? Emily!"
"EMILY: I'm right here, Richard. What's wrong?"
"RICHARD: This is outrageous! They've completely ruined it!"
"EMILY: Who ruined what?"
"RICHARD: Trix's obituary. The Courant just faxed it through. It's disgraceful! I'll sue them!"
"EMILY: Just calm down."
"LORELAI: [taking the paper and reading] ""Lorelai Gilmore died this week at age 86. A member of the prominent Gilmore family and widow of Charles Abbott Gilmore, she is survived by a son, Richard Gilmore, and numerous other family members and devoted friends."""
"EMILY: Well, it's -"
"RICHARD: It's an insult! That's all they write? Nothing about her charity work or her collecting or her travels? And not a word about the new maternity wing that she donated to St. Joseph's! You tell me where all of the fine people of Hartford are supposed to have all their babies if it weren't for my mother, tell me that!"
"EMILY: All right, all right, calm down. We will take care of it."
"RICHARD: She was a saint, that woman!"
"EMILY: I know. Absolutely, we will make sure it says ""saint"" somewhere in the article."
"RICHARD: You're sure?"
"LORELAI: Don't worry, Dad."
"RICHARD: Because it's very, very wrong!"
"LORELAI: Dad, I got your spoon."
"RICHARD: Well, I'm not hungry. [leaves]"
"EMILY: Wonderful. Yet another thing I have to take care of."
"LORELAI: Mom, why don't you let me help out a little?"
"EMILY: That's all right."
"LORELAI: I'm happy to do it. I'll bring coffee, a Danish. You've never had so much fun with death in your life."
"EMILY: I appreciate the offer, but I have it all under control."
"LORELAI: I should probably take off then."
"EMILY: Goodbye. Thank Sookie for me. [picks up the phone and dials] Hello, I'm looking for Manny Martelli, please. Well, what time do you expect him back from the science-fiction convention? Yes. Would you hold on a minute, please? [to Lorelai] Lorelai, I have to go to Gran's house tomorrow to sort through her personal papers."
"LORELAI: Two cherry Danish coming up."
"EMILY: [into phone] Yes, I would like to leave a message."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is watching TV in her room when the phone rings.]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hey, it's me."
"RORY: Nigella just made a raisin cake that looked so good, the fact that raisins make me gag became totally irrelevant."
"LORELAI: Well, good, more ordering choices."
"RORY: Oh, my God, she's about to deep-fry a Bounty Bar. I want to move in with her and call her Mommy. Do you mind?"
"LORELAI: Honey, I -- I have to tell you something."
"RORY: You sound sad."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, Gran died."
"RORY: What? When?"
"LORELAI: Last night. She had a heart attack. Are you okay?"
"RORY: How's Grandpa?"
"LORELAI: Well, he's been better."
"RORY: What should I do? Can I do something?"
"LORELAI: No, it's all being taken care of."
"RORY: When's the funeral?"
"LORELAI: Friday, and there's a wake after. I don't remember if you have a class."
"RORY: Doesn't matter. I'll make it work."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: I was just getting to know her."
"LORELAI: Well, I think you got a pretty good snapshot."
"RORY: Shouldn't I be crying? I feel like I should be crying."
"LORELAI: Well, you didn't know her that well."
"RORY: Still, she was my great-grandmother. I mean, I should feel more. [gets more and more upset] Oh, God, what if I don't cry at the funeral? Then everyone will see that I'm not crying, and Grandpa will be upset."
"LORELAI: Well, honey, if you can't cry, at least you know you can work yourself up into a very respectable panic attack."
"RORY: It might have to do."
"LORELAI: You're an amazing kid. She was so lucky to have you as a great-granddaughter. Hey, do you want me to come by tonight, pick you up, take you to Tijuana, get you drunk and laid?"
"RORY: That's okay. I've got too much work to do."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, call me if you want to talk or whatever."
"RORY: I will."
"LORELAI: I love you, hon."
"RORY: I love you, too, Mom."
"CUT TO GRAN'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Emily are going through Gran's papers.]"
"LORELAI: This looks like -- what a shock -- another incoherent legal document."
"EMILY: Hand it to me."
"LORELAI: Uh...""house insurance policy."""
"EMILY: Hand it to me."
"LORELAI: You know, Mom, seriously, I can do more than just hand you stuff."
"EMILY: That's all right. I have a system."
"LORELAI: Yes. You don't think I can work within the system, but I can! I have no plans to overthrow the system. Just teach me the system. Teach it!"
"EMILY: Just hand me some papers."
"[Lorelai groans. A woman walks into the room.]"
"GEORGIA: Emily, excuse me. We finished cataloging the second floor, and we're about to move to the third."
"EMILY: That's fine, Georgia."
"GEORGIA: And we have bubble-wrapped those bar glasses. Where do you want us to put them?"
"EMILY: In the trunk of my car, along with the candlesticks. My keys are in the foyer."
"GEORGIA: All right."
"LORELAI: What was that about?"
"EMILY: I'm preparing for the funeral."
"LORELAI: Stashing bar glasses is preparing for the funeral?"
"EMILY: Those bar glasses are supposed to stay in the family. They go to us, then to you. However, every time a certain relative of your father's comes to visit, things tend to disappear."
"LORELAI: Dad's got a Winona in the family? How cool. Who is it?"
"EMILY: His cousin Marilyn. She has been systematically pilfering those bar glasses for the last five years."
"LORELAI: Really."
"EMILY: Plus, I saw her eyeing the candlesticks last Easter, and I'll be damned if I let her get them. So much to do. [ Sighs ] Did I tell you about the burial-slash-cremation clause?"
"LORELAI: Now you're just making stuff up."
"EMILY: Your grandmother is to have an open-casket ceremony, displayed in all her glory, then is to be cremated and have her ashes divided in two -- half to be buried with her husband in the family crypt, and the other half to be put in an urn and placed on our mantelpiece."
"LORELAI: Half of Gran is going to be on your mantel forever."
"EMILY: Staring at me, judging me, disapproving of me."
"LORELAI: So apparently, it's the top half."
"EMILY: When I first found out, I almost had a coronary, but I've accepted it. From now on, it's going to be a 3-person household -- your father, me, and her urn."
"LORELAI: You know, it's so weird. I know so little about Gran. I mean, like, what was her maiden name?"
"EMILY: Gilmore."
"LORELAI: No, no, her maiden name."
"EMILY: Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Wait. Y-you're not saying -"
"EMILY: She and Charles were second cousins."
"LORELAI: Ew! What?!"
"EMILY: Oh, don't act so scandalized. It was not at all uncommon for prominent families to keep the bloodlines closed."
"LORELAI: Keeping the bloodlines closed. Is that what we're calling it?"
"EMILY: Well, what would you call it?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. How about ""Good morning, Appalachia, I got a mighty cute sister and an extra set of toes."""
"EMILY: No one has any extra toes."
"LORELAI: I have a double-jointed thumb."
"EMILY: Remarkable. Use it to hand me some more papers, please."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, but I don't understand how everyone was so okay with this. I mean, what, did they just go, ""What a cute couple. They look so much alike."" [no answer] Mom?"
"EMILY: This is to your father. It's a carbon copy of a letter she sent to your father."
"LORELAI: Hmm. That's nice."
"EMILY: [reading] ""My Dearest Richard, It is with heavy heart that I write you this letter tonight, but I cannot stand by and let you make a terrible mistake. Until now, I had thought, hoped, prayed that you would come to the same conclusion that I have. But you have not, and therefore, I feel it is my duty as your mother to beg you to reconsider your impending marriage."" [Lorelai gasps.] ""I'm sure that Emily is a very suitable woman for someone, but not for you. She will not be able to make you happy. She does not have the Gilmore stamina or spark. She is simply not a Gilmore."""
"LORELAI: Well, sure, 'cause you weren't directly related to him."
"EMILY: [continues reading] ""I don't know the circumstances surrounding your breakup with Pennilyn Lott, but it is still my belief that she is much better suited for you than Emily."" [Voice breaking] ""I know that the timing of this is particularly awkward, since you are to be married tomorrow."""
"LORELAI: No way!"
"EMILY: [reading] ""But your happiness is too important to me, so timing be damned."""
"LORELAI: She wanted Dad to leave you at the altar."
"EMILY: She begged him to leave me at the altar! She begged him in writing, and then she saved the carbons!"
"LORELAI: Holy moly. Can I see that?"
"EMILY: I can't believe this. I'm standing here in her basement, covered in dust. I'm organizing her estate and cataloging her things. I've been on the phone for days, trying to make sure that everything was exactly the way she wanted it, and all this time, she never even wanted me in her family!"
"LORELAI: Man, she sure used a lot of exclamation points."
"EMILY: Well, fine. That's just fine, because I am done."
"LORELAI: Done?"
"EMILY: I'm done planning and running around and calling people. I'm done with anything having to do with that woman."
"LORELAI: But Dad…"
"EMILY: Skipped my best friend's funeral to golf -- that's what your dad did!"
"LORELAI: Mom, we have to plan this funeral."
"EMILY: Find a box, throw her in, we're done!"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Better yet, throw the old harpy's carcass in a ditch! Let a wolverine eat her."
"LORELAI: Okay, but, see, finding a wolverine near a ditch -- that takes planning."
"EMILY: Do whatever you want! I'm going to have a drink. Would you like a drink?"
"LORELAI: I can't do it, Mom! I don't know the system!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the table going through Gran's papers.]"
"RORY: Bank info?"
"LORELAI: Hand it to me."
"RORY: I cannot believe that story."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, trust me, the brothers Grimm were over in the corner, yelling, ""No way!"""
"RORY: And she just walked out?"
"LORELAI: Yep."
"RORY: Jewelry appraisal?"
"LORELAI: Hand it to me."
"RORY: Why don't you just tell me where to put it?"
"LORELAI: No, because I have a system."
"RORY: Oh. Well, that letter sounds awful."
"LORELAI: It was."
"RORY: And really cruel."
"LORELAI: So cruel -- so completely cruel that I'm kind of wondering if Gran didn't know Mom was gonna find it."
"RORY: Stop. It's too mean. I don't wanna think that there's that meanness in my genes. I don't wanna inherit something like that."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, who knows what we've inherited from that woman. Count your toes lately?"
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: Well, I've been saving the best for last."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: Do you know what Gran's maiden name was?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Gilmore. Grandpa Charles was her second cousin!"
"RORY: No!"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: What does that mean about us? What if that's caused, like, a horrible genetic mutation that hasn't shown up yet? Oh, our eyes!"
"LORELAI: What? We each have two of them."
"RORY: I always thought it was neat that our eyes look kind of similar, but now I don't know. Is it creepy?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: I think it's creepy."
"LORELAI: Okay, just hand me some more stuff. Stop staring at my eyes. Come on."
"RORY: What else do you have to do?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I haven't tracked down this Reverend Wilder yet, and I got some mysterious message from the place that made her headstone, so I have to go see about that. And then there's just the random stuff."
"RORY: What random stuff?"
"LORELAI: Well, for instance, Gran requested that she be buried in fresh clothing."
"RORY: What is fresh clothing?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Clean clothing? Clothes fresh from the cleaners? New clothes? Clothes with a mountain-fresh scent?"
"RORY: I think it's new clothing."
"LORELAI: It's safest, isn't it? So add that to the list with the headstone. Oh, and then there's the obituary. I almost forgot about the obituary."
"RORY: What about the obituary?"
"LORELAI: The paper wrote something, but Dad thinks it's not good enough, so I have to rewrite her death announcement. I should let Mom do it. I believe it would go, ""yay."""
"RORY: Hey, can I do it? I want to help, and we have access to a database at the Yale paper that would make it really easy to research."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, that would be great. Thank you."
"RORY: My pleasure. I just feel really bad for Grandpa, losing his mother."
"LORELAI: Well, they were really close."
"RORY: Yeah. It's sad. So, Gran and her husband had the same great-grandfather."
"LORELAI: Try not to think about it."

"LORELAI: Hello? Oh. Mom, Dad?"
"SOOKIE: Look at all this stuff! Oh."
"LORELAI: Mom, are you here?"
"EMILY: In the living room, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah. Where's the maid? You got a condolence moat going on out here. [Lorelai and Sookie make their way into the living room to find Emily smoking and drinking and reading a book in her robe.] Whoa."
"EMILY: I told Hilda to take the day off. Nothing's happening here."
"LORELAI: I think every delivery boy in town would beg to differ."
"EMILY: What? Oh, those. Just put those anywhere. I have to finish reading The Crimson Petal and the White for my book club. Sookie, what a pleasant surprise! What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: I brought Sookie so she could check what equipment she's going to need for the wake. And who the hell are you?!"
"SOOKIE: I'm so sorry, Emily."
"EMILY: About what?"
"SOOKIE: Well, about Richard's mother dying."
"EMILY: Are you? Huh. Would you like a cigarette?"
"SOOKIE: No, thank you."
"EMILY: Well, then, more for me."
"SOOKIE: I think she broke."
"LORELAI: Mom, what's going on?"
"SOOKIE: I am just gonna go to the kitchen."
"LORELAI: Mom!"
"EMILY: Lorelai, please, I'm reading."
"LORELAI: Uh...okay."
"[The doorbell rings.]"
"EMILY: If you're going by the bar, my drink could use a little freshening up."
"LORELAI: Your drink is fresh enough! And put that cigarette out!"
"[Lorelai opens the door to Jason.]"
"LORELAI: Hi, Jason."
"JASON: Hey, I didn't know you were gonna be here."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, well, the white rabbit ran by. I chased him, fell down a hole, and here I am."
"JASON: So, how's everybody doing?"
"LORELAI: Uh, well, Dad's a mess, and Mom starts work at the truck stop next week."
"JASON: Are you holding up?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I am. Thanks for asking."
"JASON: Well, it's what I'm here for."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"JASON: No. I have to get your father's signature on some papers."
"LORELAI: Mom, where's Dad?"
"EMILY: How the hell do I know?"
"JASON: [sarcastically] Boy, she sounds really upset."
"LORELAI: He's probably in his study."
"JASON: Okay, thanks."
"LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Careful."
"[Jason knocks on the door of Richard's study. Richard comes to the door unshaven and wearing a bathrobe.]"
"RICHARD: Oh, Jason."
"JASON: Richard, I am so sorry to hear."

"LORELAI: It was Jason. Dad needs to sign something."
"EMILY: Uh-huh."
"LORELAI: You know what? Why don't I start putting some of these baskets away?"
"EMILY: Whatever."
"LORELAI: And then maybe I could start writing some thank-you notes."
"EMILY: Fine. I think there's some Post-its in the kitchen."
"LORELAI: Mom, uh...I know how hurt you are. That letter was terrible. But there's still a lot of stuff that has to get done."
"EMILY: I know. You're right. Say, I've got an idea. Why don't you call Pennilyn Lott and have her plan the funeral?"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: I mean, she's the one that was supposed to be planning it anyhow, so I say let her do it. You need something, Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: I was just wondering if it's going to be okay to set up a buffet in the dining room."
"EMILY: I don't know. What do you think Pennilyn Lott would do? You think she'd set it up in the dining room? Because personally, I think we should just toss some cheese cubes in the coffin, stuff some toothpicks in her mouth, and let the people go to town."
"SOOKIE: Is she serious?"
"LORELAI: The dining room's fine, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Okay. Good."
"[Jason comes out of the study. Lorelai goes over to him.]"
"LORELAI: Um, uh, excuse me."
"JASON: Did you see that hug?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I saw the hug, I saw the hug."
"JASON: It didn't end. It was the hug that wouldn't end, and he was wearing a robe."
"LORELAI: Yes, apparently, we're a robe family now."
"JASON: And he was crying. I am really, really bad at comforting people. I say completely inappropriate things -- bad jokes with words like ""Nantucket"" in them."
"LORELAI: Did you get what you needed?"
"JASON: Yeah, thanks."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, then I guess I'll see you at the funeral tomorrow."
"JASON: Yeah. About the actual funeral"
"LORELAI: Jason."
"JASON: I can't do funerals."
"LORELAI: You have to do funerals. This was your partner's mother."
"JASON: I understand, but funerals have way too much emotion for me -- the death and the hugging."
"LORELAI: You serious?"
"JASON: When I was 10, my family went through a terrible period. Once a month, somebody died. For a year, they were dropping like flies. It completely freaked me out."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine, don't come, but you had better lie to my father and tell him you did."
"JASON: I am very comfortable with that compromise."
"LORELAI: [goes back to Emily] That was Jason again. He had to go, but he wanted me to tell you hello for him."
"EMILY: Jason. Your father loves that boy."
"LORELAI: I know he does."
"EMILY: You know who else would love that boy? Pennilyn Lott."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna go get started on those thank-you cards."
"EMILY: Remember to thank Pennilyn Lott just for being Pennilyn Lott."
"CUT TO YALE NEWSPAPER"
"[Rory is on the phone.]"
"RORY: I'm almost done. I promise I'll get it to the paper this afternoon."
"LORELAI: This is a really big help, my friend. I owe you."
"RORY: No, it was really interesting, actually. I mean, I never knew all of these things about Gran."
"LORELAI: Really, was the extra-toe thing in there?"
"RORY: No, but did you know that she took care of wounded soldiers that were shipped back here during World w*r II? She also studied at the Sorbonne and at Oxford and met three presidents."
"LORELAI: Oh. Which ones?"
"RORY: Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. There's this amazing picture of her frowning at Nixon like she knew he was up to something."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: Yeah, she was some kind of something, wasn't she?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she kind of was."
"RORY: I just love that she wanted something so -- I got to go. [hangs up] Hi, Doyle. Hey, did you read the typo in the New York Times today?"
"DOYLE: This is personal."
"RORY: Yes. Yes, it is."
"DOYLE: You're using newspaper resources to work on something personal, in direct defiance of what I was warning everybody about just the other day."
"RORY: But this is different."
"DOYLE: Oh, it is?"
"RORY: If I can just -"
"DOYLE: Oh, goody, here comes the defense. What will it be? ""I'm looking something up for a friend?"" ""The professor didn't give me enough time?"" ""I was just browsing through the archives, and I got distracted?"""
"RORY: My grandmother is dead."
"DOYLE: Oh. Oh, no."
"RORY: Yeah, she died two days ago, suddenly, and we were close. Okay? We were close, and I'm just trying to give her an obituary that is fitting for the great woman that she was."
"DOYLE: Oh. That's -- I didn't know."
"RORY: You didn't ask."
"DOYLE: My grandmother died in December, and it was... [sighs] I'm still not over it. I know exactly what you're going through. Keep going, please. I'm sorry."
"RORY: It's okay. And thank you."
"DOYLE: Last week, you know what I did?"
"RORY: No."
"DOYLE: I picked up the phone to call her. Isn't that sad? I actually forgot, and then, of course, it hit me all over again. I hope that doesn't happen to you."
"RORY: Me too."
"DOYLE: She smelled a little like coffee. I still can't walk past any place that makes coffee."
"RORY: Oh."
"DOYLE: The girl I was dating was a barista. I had to break up with her."
"RORY: We weren't that close."
"DOYLE: What?"
"RORY: And it wasn't my grandmother. It was my great-grandmother. I dropped the ""great"" to make the whole thing sound sadder. I don't know anything about her until today. [sighs] I'm so sorry. I'm just gonna pack up and go straight to hell now."
"DOYLE: My grandmother was a very special woman. She drove me to my prom, and I'd be a poor man if I'd never known her. Finish the obituary."
"RORY: What?"
"GLENN: What?"
"DOYLE: Everybody should get to know their grandmother."
"GLENN: But it was her great-grandmother. Didn't you hear her?"
"DOYLE: Glenn, you take Rory's piece on the new parking rules, okay?"
"GLENN: My month lasts a month. Your month lasts three days. Yes, sirree, folks, that is my life!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Everyone in the diner is quiet. They're listening to the sounds of yelling coming from Luke's apartment upstairs. Miss Patty walks in the door.]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, Kirk, good, I've been -"
"CUSTOMERS: Shh!"
"MISS PATTY: What are we listening to? [Kirk points upstairs.] Again?"
"KIRK: Yep."
"[Rapid footsteps approaching. Everyone pretends to be busy as Luke comes into the diner.]"
"LUKE: Who needs to order?"
"MISS PATTY: I do."
"LUKE: Go ahead."
"MISS PATTY: I'll have a chef's salad."
"LUKE: Dressing?"
"MISS PATTY: Oil and vinegar on the side."
"LUKE: Crackers or roll?"
"MISS PATTY: Um..."
"KIRK: Get the crackers, get the crackers."
"MISS PATTY: Uh, I'll have the -"
"NICOLE: Luke!"
"LUKE: What?"
"NICOLE: Are you coming back?"
"LUKE: I'm working."
"NICOLE: We were having a discussion and you just got up and left."
"LUKE: I thought we were done."
"NICOLE: I was in the middle of the word ""September."""
"LUKE: [Sighs and points to the door.] Okay, come on. [They go outside.] Okay, go ahead."
"NICOLE: We were in the middle of a conversation!"
"LUKE: We were yelling. It was a fight."
"NICOLE: We weren't yelling."
"LUKE: It felt like yelling."
"NICOLE: Okay, we won't yell. We'll talk."
"LUKE: Fine, talk."
"NICOLE: Me? What about you?"
"LUKE: You're the one who wanted to talk. We're here. Let's talk."
"NICOLE: You don't want to talk?"
"LUKE: I don't have anything to say."
"NICOLE: Yeah. Me either. [Starts to walk away.]"
"LUKE: [ Sighs ] Nicole."
"NICOLE: What?"
"LUKE: You going back to our place?"
"NICOLE: Our place? [ Scoffs ] Our place. Huh. Funny."
"[As Nicole walks away, Luke turns to see everyone in the diner crowded at the window watching the fight.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Richard opens the door to Lorelai and Rory.]"
"LORELAI: Dad, why are you answering the door?"
"RICHARD: Uh, well, I heard it ring, so, um..."
"LORELAI: The maid's taking the day off again?"
"RICHARD: Yeah, I suppose so. Rory, it's nice to see you."
"RORY: I'm so sorry, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Thank you, Rory."
"RORY: How are you?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'm having a devil of a time with this tie."
"RORY: And you're not wearing any shoes."
"RICHARD: What? Oh, yeah, shoes."
"LORELAI: Dad, can't Mom help you with the tie?"
"RICHARD: Yes. Yes. Uh, I don't know where she's gotten to. There are a lot of plans to make. Oh, someone sent us four hams. Can you imagine? Four hams."
"[Emily comes downstairs wearing her robe again.]"
"LORELAI: Mom, there you are."
"EMILY: [ Slurring ] Rory, you look very nice."
"RORY: I brought a dress to change into."
"EMILY: Oh, what you're wearing is fine. [hands Lorelai a book] Lorelai, here, I just finished reading, and I think you'll really like it. It's about this prostitute named Sugar in Victorian England. She starts rising through the ranks of society, and she meets these really vivid characters!"
"LORELAI: Okay, sure, you don't have to tell me the whole story now."
"EMILY: I'm not giving anything away. That's all on the back cover."
"LORELAI: Dad? [to Rory] Follow him. Point out doors and windows."
"RORY: Got it. [Rory follows Richard upstairs.]"
"LORELAI: So, Mom, you might want to go get ready now."
"EMILY: Nonsense! We have hours. Want a drink? Today I learned how to make mojitos!"
"LORELAI: Mom, today especially, you might want to be early, since we're the ones throwing the funeral."
"EMILY: Fine."
"LORELAI: There you go. Go on upstairs. Put on a dress -- a black dress."
"RORY: [comes back downstairs] I got him to sit down."
"LORELAI: Okay, pillow. Soft. Good."
"RORY: You're right, they're a little nutty."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. With extra nuts on top. Okay, I have to check and make sure that Sookie's kitchen stuff made it over here. And I have to call the airline and make sure the reverend got on the plane. I have to check in with the headstone -- [ Gasps ] Underwear."
"RORY: Um, that took a turn."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God. I delivered Gran's clothes to the funeral home, but I forgot to include underwear."
"RORY: Gran's going commando?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no. I'll have to go buy some."
"RORY: Well, wait a minute. Who's gonna know?"
"LORELAI: I'll know. Just stay here. Keep an eye on your grandpa. I'll be right back."
"CUT TO STORE"
"[Lorelai looks at racks of underwear, unsure what to buy. A saleswoman comes up behind her.]"
"SHANNON: This whole section is our 2-for-1 sale."
"LORELAI: Listen -"
"SHANNON: Shannon."
"LORELAI: Shannon, um, I need to buy something for my grandmother."
"SHANNON: Any particular style?"
"LORELAI: Something respectable, upstanding. You got anything that came over on the Mayflower?"
"SHANNON: We have this whole line of really terrific panties, and they have a built-in tummy panel that older women really love."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, tummy panel sounds great."
"SHANNON: What size is she?"
"LORELAI: Size? Uh, she's tiny but strong. She looks like she could take a punch. But she wears these big dresses, so who knows what's going on under there."
"SHANNON: Okay, well -"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, she wore big dresses. She wore big dresses, 'cause she's dead."
"SHANNON: Oh."
"LORELAI: Do you have any idea what ""fresh clothing"" means?"
"SHANNON: No."
"LORELAI: Neither do I. I'm guessing it means ""new,"" and that's why I'm here, because I have to do all the - all the planning now, because my mother found the note. [Scoffs] The stupid note. Who writes a note like that and keeps the carbon?"
"SHANNON: I don't -"
"LORELAI: Yeah, my grandmother -- that's who. My grandmother, who wants fresh clothing and a 4,000-year-old minister, who wants to be cremated and put in a jar on top of my mother's mantelpiece to sit up there and judge for all eternity. I bet your family's looking really great to you right about now, huh?"
"SHANNON: Yes, they are."
"LORELAI: Yeah. [Chuckles] Oh, God. [Sniffles] I'm just babbling. I'm standing in underwire heaven just babbling like a crazy person. I should just pick something, because, I mean, what difference does it make? She's dead. You know, the woman is dead. She can't tell what she's wearing or who bought it for her. She can't see the mess she's left behind, so I'll just -- I'll take this."
"SHANNON: That's a small."
"LORELAI: Hello! She's dead! The woman is dead! She can't tell if it's the right size! She wanted fresh clothes, and I'm here buying her fresh clothes. So if she has a problem with the size or the strawberry print, then she can rise from the dead and come back here and yell at me herself. Because you know what, if anyone could, that tough, old, crazy, wonderful broad would be the one! [Sniffles] You take Visa, right?"
"SHANNON: Mm-hmm."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Rory helps Richard with his tie.]"
"RORY: Okay, so, according to this, we're almost home. I just pull this through there, which looks promising, and we're done. Now you just do the final adjusting."
"RICHARD: Well, that's not bad."
"RORY: Fourth time's the charm."
"RICHARD: Very handy little sheet you've got there. Where'd you get it?"
"RORY: Off the internet. You can find anything there."
"RICHARD: Hmm. Very nice."
"RORY: Do you want to keep it -- the diagram? I don't think I'll be needing it much around the dorm"
"RICHARD: [ Chuckles ] Well, in that case, I will. Thank you, Rory."
"RORY: Now I think all we need is your jacket and your shoes, and you're ready."
"RICHARD: [ Sighs ] Yes, I suppose so. You know, the suit I wore when we buried my father -- I was never able to wear it again. It was brand-new -- a very nice suit. Custom-made. It was my first custom-made suit. I told your grandmother that it didn't fit anymore, but really, I just didn't want to see it again. And I suppose this is going to be it for this suit, too."
"RORY: So, I hear you're doing the eulogy."
"RICHARD: Well, I'm her son."
"RORY: Are you gonna be okay doing that?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'll have to be, I suppose."
"RORY: Because if you find yourself feeling, you know, unsteady about it, I can do it. I did a lot of reading about Gran for the obituary, and I think I can do her justice."
"RICHARD: She had a life, didn't she?"
"RORY: She really did."
"RICHARD: Well, I thank you for your offer, but this is my responsibility. I will be fine."
"RORY: I'm sure you will."
"RICHARD: However, if something happens, and I find myself, let us say, a tad more emotional than I would like -"
"RORY: I got your back, Grandpa."
"[Richard sighs.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE -- DOWNSTAIRS"
"[Lorelai walks in the front door with a shopping bag. Emily, dressed for the funeral, is sitting at the table.]"
"EMILY: Did you go shopping? I've been sitting here waiting for you."
"[Lorelai sighs.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE - NIGHT"
"[After the funeral. Richard is greeting the mourners.]"
"RICHARD: Thank you. Thanks so much for coming. Appreciate it."
"RORY: Nice job with the eulogy, Gilmore."
"RICHARD: Well, I've always found that a well-tied bow tie can have a very steadying effect."
"JENSON: Richard, she was a hell of a lady."
"EMMA: I don't know what the hospital board will do without her."
"RICHARD: I appreciate both of you coming. Have you met my granddaughter Rory?"
"JENSON: No, I don't believe we have."
"EMMA: Nice to meet you, Rory."
"RORY: Nice to meet you, too. I'm gonna go get a soda. Excuse me."
"EMMA: She's lovely, Richard."
"RICHARD: Inside and out."
"[Rory walks over to Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: How's he doing?"
"RORY: Not bad. He's holding it together -- partly because all these people are here, but I think he's doing better."
"LORELAI: Good. So, what did you think of Gran's fabulous, fresh clothing?"
"RORY: I thought it was very sophisticated."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"RORY: But don't think, for a second, that I didn't notice the Hello Kitty bracelet you put on her."
"LORELAI: I just thought, a little something special from me and you for all eternity."
"MARILYN: So, there she was, dragging poor Charles around Egypt, of all places. I mean, the man detested sand. So, of course, Lorelai wanted to go and see the pyramids right away. Well, he was dragging his feet. He wanted to go to the hotel. He said, ""Lorelai, those pyramids have been there for thousands of years, so they can wait another day."" And she said, ""Well, you didn't marry the pyramids. You married me, and I won't wait another hour."" And she jumped on a camel and rode away. Dragged the camel's owner behind her for over a mile. Man almost died. [ Laughter ] There she is. Lorelai, come here and say hello to your father's favorite cousin."
"LORELAI: Hi, Marilyn."
"MARILYN: Look at you. You look just like your picture. You know, your grandmother had this picture of you right smack-dab in the middle of her entryway. You would walk in the door, she would point to the picture, and she would say, ""This is my granddaughter, Lorelai. She's not married."""
"LORELAI: Oh, that's a terrific story."
"MARILYN: You are stunning! My god, tell me you're an idiot, I beg you."
"LORELAI: I have my moments. How's that?"
"MARILYN: And you, miss. Am I possibly related to you also?"
"LORELAI: Yes, this is my daughter Rory."
"MARILYN: It is a thrill to meet you both. Horrible circumstances, I suppose. Anyway angels, tell me: when you were last over at your grandmother's house, did you possibly notice some darling little bar glasses?"
"LORELAI: Bar glasses?"
"MARILYN: Crystal, with this little gold-leaf pattern around?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't think so."
"MARILYN: Oh, well, I was just wondering. They weren't valuable, just sentimental. I used to admire them as a small child."
"LORELAI: Well, sure, what little kid doesn't have a fascination with bar glasses?"
"MARILYN: Well, if you ever do see them -"
"LORELAI: Yes, I'll let you know. I -- I'm sorry, I have to go check the caterer."
"MARILYN: Go, go, go. I can visit with Rory."
"RORY: Okay. Hey, I heard you talking about Gran in Egypt."
"MARILYN: Oh, she loved Egypt. Actually, she loved anyplace exotic. Did she ever tell you about the time she was stranded in Istanbul?"
"RORY: No. Well, I actually didn't know her very well."
"MARILYN: Oh, that's a terrible shame."
"RORY: I think so, too."
"DARCY: It was a lovely service. You did a wonderful job."
"EMILY: Thank you."
"DARCY: It seems like we're hitting that age, now aren't we, where we're going to be going to a lot of these things. Time to invest in a second black suit, I suppose."
"EMILY: [to a passing waiter] Excuse me, please bring my husband a Manhattan, and make sure the hors d'oeuvres start with him. He has to eat something."
"RORY: [to a boy her age] Yeah, I think philosophy may be one of my favorite subjects right now."
"LORELAI: [whispers to Rory] Second cousin."
"RORY: Got to go."
"BOY: Wait, I'll come with you. [follows Rory]"
"LORELAI: [loudly] Reverend Wilder, hi. Thank you so much for coming all the way up here from Florida to be with us. Gran would have been so pleased."
"REVEREND: Oh, thank you. I was happy to do it. And you are?"
"LORELAI: I'm Lorelai Gilmore."
"REVEREND: Didn't I just bury you?"
"LORELAI: No, Reverend, I'm the one who talked to you on the phone, and I picked you up from the airport."
"REVEREND: Oh, really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"MARILYN: That was a different Lorelai. This is her granddaughter. This is the reigning Lorelai."
"REVEREND: Oh, how nice. And who are you?"
"LORELAI: This is Gran's niece, Marilyn."
"MARILYN: You remember me from when I was younger. You married me to my first husband, Theodore."
"REVEREND: I did?"
"MARILYN: It would be easier on all of us if you can just pretend to remember."
"REVEREND: Oh, well, that's probably a good idea."
"[Lorelai sits down next to Emily and sighs.]"
"LORELAI: How are you holding up?"
"EMILY: My feet are k*ll me."
"LORELAI: How's the rest of you?"
"EMILY: The rest of me? The rest of me is fine."
"LORELAI: Oh, you know, Mom, she may have written that letter, but he picked you."
"EMILY: I can't believe you wore those shoes to a funeral."
"LORELAI: I'm going to go get a stuffed mushroom now."
"[Emily walks over to Richard.]"
"RICHARD: Hmm."
"EMILY: Your tie is crooked."
"RICHARD: Oh."
"EMILY: Have you eaten?"
"RICHARD: Oh, yes. Every five minutes, it seems a young man would show up at my side with a tray of food. Your doing, I suppose."
"EMILY: Could be. There, that's better."
"RICHARD: So, I've been thinking."
"EMILY: Yes?"
"RICHARD: I'm not so sure the mantel is the best place for Gran's ashes."
"EMILY: What?"
"RICHARD: The ledge is too small. It wouldn't really be appropriate."
"EMILY: But her wishes."
"RICHARD: Being buried with my father seems right. Don't you agree?"
"EMILY: Whatever you want, Richard."
"[Lorelai walks through the room.]"
"MARILYN: So, there she is, Aunt Lorelai -- already in her 70s, mind you -- and the blizzard has her trapped in that old house for a week with no heat, no running water. The local police finally came and dug her out and handed her some hot tea. And you know what she does? First of all, she complains that the tea is too hot, and then she sends them a bill for carpet cleaning, because they tracked in snow."
"[Lorelai sees Rory and goes over to sit at a table with her.]"
"LORELAI: So, you ditched the cousin?"
"RORY: Yeah, we ran into a sister, and how could I compete?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure. How are you doing?"
"RORY: I'm feeling sadder about Gran, but feeling sadder is making me feel less guilty about not feeling sad, so things are looking up."
"LORELAI: Good. So, apparently, I am now the reigning Lorelai."
"RORY: Huh. I guess you are."
"LORELAI: It's a lot of responsibility."
"RORY: Well, sure."
"LORELAI: It's mostly ceremonial stuff nowadays -- declaring knighthoods, opening supermarkets -- but now and then, you get to banish someone or pose for a stamp."
"RORY: Neat. And coins."
"LORELAI: Yeah and coins. You know, someday you'll be the reigning Lorelai."
"RORY: I don't like that idea."
"LORELAI: Why not? You get a cape."
"RORY: Because if I'm the reigning Lorelai, that means you'll be gone."
"LORELAI: Gone? No, not me. I'll step down way before that. I'm not gonna pull a Queen Elizabeth on you, make you wait around forever, force you to develop interests in polo and architecture."
"RORY: I am scared of horses."
"LORELAI: I know that."
"RORY: So, there's a cape, huh?"

"OPEN WITH LORELAI & RORY RIDING IN KIRK'S PEDI-CAB"
"RORY: This is humiliating."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, we passed humiliating two minutes ago."
"RORY: Luke's gonna be completely out of doughnuts by the time we get there."
"LORELAI: I don't why he won't just buy six extra sprinkled ones, so we'd never have to have the conversation which we're going to have- if we ever get there."
"RORY: I got school in two hours. I'm never gonna make it."
"LORELAI: Kirk, how you doing? [Kirk nods head] You sure? You seem to be having a little trouble forming words there."
"KIRK: [Strained] No...fine...me."
"LORELAI: You know, you don't have to take us all the way to Luke's."
"RORY: Yes, Kirk, listen to her."
"KIRK: I offered you the first ride in Kirk's new Stars Hollow Pedi-cab, and that is exactly what you're gonna get."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"KIRK: Time just whizzes by when you're riding in a pedi-cab."
"GYPSY: Hey, guys."
"RORY: Hey, Gypsy."
"LORELAI: Hey, Gypsy."
"RORY: Gypsy just out-strolled us."
"LORELAI: We've gotta get outta here."
"KIRK: How we doing back there?"
"RORY: We're doing fine, Kirk."
"KIRK: I figure this baby's gonna be a real money..."
"LORELAI: A real money- moneywhat, Kirk?"
"RORY: Kirk, can you breathe?"
"[Kirk gasps for breath.]"
"LORELAI: Talk to us."
"RORY: Hit the handlebars three times if you can breathe and two if you can't. He hit once."
"LORELAI: What does once mean?"
"RORY: That he couldn't make it to twice?"
"LORELAI: Kirk. Kirk, stop, please."
"KIRK: Just for a second. Then we'll be on our way... like the wind."
"LORELAI: Okay, you know what, Kirk? This has been really fun, but I think we'll just hoof it the rest of the way."
"KIRK: But the ride wasn't over yet."
"RORY: Yeah, but we don't want to hog the cab."
"LORELAI: 'Cause there's only one."
"RORY: But we'll tell our friends."
"KIRK: What was wrong with the ride?"
"LORELAI: Uh, nothing. I mean, it's great for tourists who are new to the town and want to make sure they don't miss a thing."
"KIRK: I wasn't going that slow."
"LORELAI: No, you just maybe need a little more training before tourist season kicks in. You know, take a spinning class or buy some legs."
"RORY: Sorry, Kirk."
"KIRK: You will be sorry. [Calling after them] You'll be sorry you turned down the chance to ride in Stars Hollow's first..."
"RORY: Now he's gonna hate us forever."
"LORELAI: No, he's not. He's just gonna hate us till something shiny comes by."
"KIRK: [Riding past them with ease] Well, well, well. I guess it wasn't me that was slowing things down. I guess it was my big, fat cargo."
"RORY: Hey!"
"KIRK: Freshman 15!"
"LORELAI: Kirk!"
"KIRK: Can't wait to get my doughnut!"
"LORELAI: Stay away from my doughnut, Kirk! I mean it! It's my doughnut! Freak!"
"CUT TO YALE CAFETERIA"
"PARIS: You might as well stick your head in a sugar bowl."
"RORY: If you can find one big enough."
"PARIS: You won't be able to eat like that forever, you know."
"RORY: What are you getting?"
"PARIS: All bran. Asher turned me on to it."
"RORY: He's a romantic."
"PARIS: He wants me to live a long time and be healthy. That is romantic."
"RORY: Okay. Just a joke. No reflection on your man-friend."
"PARIS: So after breakfast, I'm going to pick up the sign for our table, and then I'll meet you in the courtyard. [Holding teabag] Antioxidants."
"RORY: Yeah, I'll meet you in the courtyard."
"PARIS: I'm actually really excited about this. I mean, it's our first social protest of significance in college."
"RORY: I know, it's so exciting. We actually get to do something important, make a difference, have a say in the world."
"PARIS: Wouldn't it be amazing if we could just get one Burmese political prisoner released because of our petition?"
"RORY: You're thinking small, Geller. Let's get 'em all out."
"PARIS: Even the guilty ones."
"RORY: Hell, yeah."
"GLENN: Seriously? 'Cause that'd be great, really great. Okay, so I'll pick you up at 7:00, Saturday morning."
"JANET: Okay, Glenn."
"GLENN: Thank you, seriously."
"JANET: No problem, Glenn."
"GLENN: This is a turning point. You know how you have them, when even the angry voices in your head have to shut up for just a minute?"
"RORY: Sure."
"PARIS: Why is he so happy?"
"JANET: Oh, I couldn't get away earlier for spring break. My friends are leaving without me. I need a ride, Glenn has a van, and there you go."
"PARIS: You're going to ride to Florida with a guy who's bummed that he got turned down by that German cannibal?"
"JANET: That was just a rumor and, yes, I'm desperate."
"RORY: Glenn's not that bad. I'm sure you'll be fine."
"JANET: Hey, there's extra room in the van, in case you guys need a ride."
"RORY: Oh, no, thank you. I don't think we're gonna do the whole spring break thing."
"PARIS: Ever since I broke up with Moondoggie, soakin' up the rays hasn't been the same."
"JANET: It's going to be really fun. You're missing out."
"RORY: I'm not really a spring break kind of gal, but thank you for the offer."
"JANET: Okay, but if you change your mind..."
"PARIS: Gary Gilmore's got room in the car -- got it."
"RORY: Oh, Janet, if you have a chance, you should stop by and sign our petition for political prisoners in Burma."
"JANET: I'll try. Actually, I have to run out and get a new bathing suit before my class this afternoon."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: [Calling after Janet] Think of all the tortured souls festering in Burma while you're at the size-2 rack. [To Rory] I hate that she's thin."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: I saw you come in. I was gonna get to you, okay?"
"LORELAI: Sorry?"
"LUKE: If you don't like the service, you can go somewhere else."
"LORELAI: Who could not like the service?"
"LUKE: I'm busy. You ready to order?"
"LORELAI: Coffee for now. Is everything okay?"
"LUKE: You're not gonna eat?"
"LORELAI: No, I just came in for coffee and to show you something. We got the sample stationery and postcards for the inn."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: You know, the stationery and the postcards that you leave in the guests' room so that they can write a letter home saying, ""Having a great time- wish you were here."" Which, of course, they don't, because you were the thing they were trying to get away from in this first place."
"LUKE: Nobody uses that stuff."
"LORELAI: Oh, sure they do."
"LUKE: I have never once stayed in a hotel and used the stationery or written a postcard. Are you gonna order?"
"LORELAI: I did order, and what is with you?"
"LUKE: Nothin'. I'm fine. The paper's fine. The postcards are fine. I don't know why you're showing them to me anyhow."
"LORELAI: Because you are an investor in the inn. I want to keep you apprised of the goings-on."
"LUKE: I am not an investor. I loaned you money."
"LORELAI: That is what investors do."
"LUKE: An investor goes to meetings."
"LORELAI: We're having a meeting."
"LUKE: They're involved in the business decisions."
"LORELAI: Hello...stationary. Decide -- yes, no."
"LUKE: [Sighs] I'll get your coffee."
"LORELAI: Um...do you want to talk about it?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Whatever it is that's put you in this charming mood."
"LUKE: [Clears throat, lowers voice] I am not wearing my socks."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: I am not wearing my socks."
"LORELAI: So, what are those, someone else's?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: I am wearing someone else's socks."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I need more."
"LUKE: I spent the night at Nicole's place."
"LORELAI: Also known as ""your place""."
"LUKE: Got up a little late, grabbed a pair of socks, and it wasn't until I was halfway to work that I realized they were someone else's socks."
"LORELAI: And you're sure about this?"
"LUKE: Hey, if there's one thing in this life I am sure about, it's my socks. I buy the same brand in bulk, and I've been doing this for as long as I can remember. My socks are all white with a red stripe. These are white with a gold stripe and some sort of fruity padding in the toe."
"LORELAI: Maybe they're Jess' socks."
"LUKE: They are not Jess' socks."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe when you went to the laundromat, someone accidentally left a pair of socks in the dryer, and then your --"
"LUKE: I don't go to a laundromat."
"LORELAI: Uh, maybe they're Nicole's socks. You know, her gym socks or... you're not wearing your socks."
"LUKE: I am not wearing my socks."
"CUT TO PARIS & RORY OUTSIDE AT YALE IN A RAINSTORM AT THEIR PETITION TABLE"
"RORY: Show your support for the Burmese prisoners."
"PARIS: Sign up now- take a stand."
"RORY: This bowl of rice is all a Burmese prisoner gets to eat in a day. One bowl- that's it. No butter or soy sauce..."
"PARIS: Enjoy your ""Maxim."" You couldn't read that in Burma!"
"RORY: I'm freezing."
"PARIS: Me too."
"RORY: [Sighs] Look at all these hypocrites passing by. Everyone claims to be so politically aware, but not one person can stop by for two seconds to sign a stupid petition."
"PARIS: People suck. [Jumps up] You all suck!"
"RORY: Paris, the rice!"
"PARIS: Great, we have one prop, and it's blowing away."
"RORY: You knocked it over."
"PARIS: Well, you put it right in front of me."
"RORY: How was I supposed to know you were gonna jump out of your seat like a maniac?"
"PARIS: You know me. You room with me. You should have known."
"GLENN: Hey, Rory, Paris."
"RORY: Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad you stopped by because this is an issue that affects every person that has a heart and a soul."
"PARIS: A great injustice is being perpetrated on our watch, and we've got to do something to stop it."
"RORY: Aren't you gonna sign the petition?"
"GLENN: No, I just needed a place to put my sandwich down."
"RORY: Is that a raindrop?"
"PARIS: Yep."
"CUT TO PARIS & RORY RUNNING INTO THEIR DORM"
"PARIS: Out of the way."
"RORY: Move, move, move!"
"FEMALE STUDENT: [Walking out of dorm] Is it raining?"
"PARIS: No, it's National Baptism Day. Tie your tubes, idiot."
"RORY: Wet."
"PARIS: Cold."
"RORY: Go, go! I get the radiator."
"PARIS: No way."
"RORY: You got it last night."
"PARIS: I did not!"
"RORY: Paris, you took up the whole thing with your ""Hey, Gore, do not endorse me"" sweatshirt, and my blue sweater is still soaked."
"PARIS: Fine! Take half."
"RORY: Oh, my god, I'm cold!"
"PARIS: Can't stop shaking."
"RORY: We're wimps -- we would last two seconds in Burma."
"PARIS: At least it's warm in Burma."
"RORY: Yeah. Okay, we're horrible."
"PARIS: This is the kind of cold you read about in a Dickens novel. We should be in a workhouse or shilling for f*g."
"RORY: It's supposed to be spring. Why is it still cold?"
"PARIS: It's been the coldest winter in the history of winter."
"RORY: My brain- I think it's frozen. Is that possible?"
"PARIS: And these gray skies- it's a blanket of misery."
"RORY: All I can think about is getting warm. That's all I can think about."
"PARIS: It's warm in Florida."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Nothing."
"RORY: Did you say ""Florida""?"
"PARIS: No. [Pauses] Yes."
"RORY: Seriously?"
"PARIS: Maybe."
"RORY: But it's spring break."
"PARIS: I know."
"RORY: It's ""girls gone wild,"" and boys doing the twist. We're not spring-breaky people, are we?"
"PARIS: I don't know what we are, but I am so cold right now that the thought of spending a week with a bunch of drunken bimbos and rattle-headed frat boys seems like a very good trade off for being warm."
"RORY: Warm..."
"PARIS: Warm..."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"RORY: Mom, where's my bathing suit?"
"LORELAI: Uh...do you have a bathing suit?"
"RORY: Of course I have a bathing suit."
"LORELAI: When was the last time you wore it?"
"RORY: I don't remember."
"LORELAI: Uh, did it involve a rubber ducky?"
"RORY: No...I don't think."
"LORELAI: Check the bottom drawer, and I will look in your closet. So now, tell me again- who's driving?"
"RORY: Glenn. It's his mom's van."
"LORELAI: And this Glenn- he's a good driver?"
"RORY: I have no idea."
"LORELAI: Kid- you've got to learn to lie."
"RORY: Glenn's a very responsible guy. I'm sure it will be fine."
"LORELAI: And the place you're staying is safe?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Now you're catching on. Ahh! Aha! Bathing suit. Now we just have to find the wimple that goes with it."
"RORY: Give me that, please. Hey, was I supposed to clear this with you first?"
"LORELAI: Clear what with me?"
"RORY: Going away."
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know."
"RORY: I mean, I don't live here anymore, so I'm not sure what the protocol is."
"LORELAI: Ah, well. I think as long as I know now, and I feel as if I have veto power, we're good."
"RORY: You have veto power?"
"LORELAI: No. I feel as if I have veto power- very different statement."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: But you'll call me a lot while you're there, right?"
"RORY: You're not worried, are you? Because I'm just going for the sun and to read, nothing more."
"LORELAI: I know, I know. It's just it's always the good kids who've never had a drink that take one sip of Kahlua and fall out of a window."
"RORY: So you're sad you never taught me how to drink?"
"LORELAI: Exactly!"
"RORY: Well grab a bottle and some quarters and let's go."
"LORELAI: No falling out of windows."
"RORY: Not even a first floor one."
"LORELAI: And don't drink. And after you're done not drinking, drink tons of water and take two aspirin before you go to bed."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: And take Paris with you everywhere. Not much can happen with that girl along."
"RORY: Got it. [Horn honks outside.] They're here."
"LORELAI: Oh. Maybe they can stop by a bathing suit store along the way."
"RORY: My suit is fine."
"LORELAI: No, sure it is. It's nice to be able to go from the beach to the mosque without having to change."
"GLENN: Seriously, Paris, get out!"
"PARIS: No! I have to drive."
"GLENN: You drive exactly like you look like you drive."
"PARIS: What's that supposed to mean?"
"GLENN: You speed like a maniac. You zip in and out of lanes. You tailgate."
"PARIS: They were going two miles an hour."
"GLENN: It was a driving-school car."
"PARIS: Well, they went to school to learn a lesson. I was just giving them their money's worth."
"RORY: Hey, guys."
"PARIS: Let's go. We're on a schedule. Get away from Glenn."
"JANET: Thank god you're here."
"RORY: Glenn, this is my mom."
"LORELAI: Hi, I'm Lorelai. Hey, congratulations on being student of the month at Grandville Middle School."
"GLENN: Thanks."
"LORELAI: You lookin' forward to the beach?"
"GLENN: Yes, I am."
"LORELAI: You know, you don't have to show up in what you're going to wear. They'll let you change when you get there."
"GLENN: I'm not cold."
"LORELAI: No, of course not. [Hands Glenn Rory's bags] Could you? Thanks."
"RORY: So, how come Paris is driving?"
"PARIS: Are we gonna go through this again?"
"RORY: I didn't know we'd already gone through it."
"PARIS: I can't be in a car if anybody else is driving, okay? If I die in a car crash, it's going to be at my own hand."
"LORELAI: Hi, Paris."
"PARIS: Hi, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: No windows."
"LORELAI: No windows. Oh, hey, um, Glenn, would you mind if Rory sits up front? She gets carsick."
"GLENN: Oh. Okay."
"LORELAI: Airbags. Okay, um, have fun. Drive safely."
"PARIS: Let's go...and say a prayer for the road k*ll. [Tires screech as she pulls away.]"
"CUT TO VAN PULLING INTO SEA SPRITE HOTEL"
"GLENN: You're a lunatic!"
"PARIS: Hey, I shaved three hours off the MapQuest estimate. How about a ""thank you"" for that? Who's in charge here?"
"RORY: I'm guessing pink shirts and white shorts?"
"GLENN: I think my clothing choice has been vindicated."
"PARIS: Swank attire and desperation for approval. The chicks are gonna eat you up. It is warm. Are you feeling the warmth?"
"RORY: I'm definitely starting to thaw."
"JACK: Name, please."
"JANET: It's under ""Billings."""
"JACK: Okay... okay, we have you girls in room 6."
"PARIS: Room 6, okay. And what is your name?"
"JACK: Jack."
"PARIS: Jack. Well, Jack, hello. I'm Paris, and this is Andrew [Holds up a $20 bill]. And we just want to make sure that we're getting your very best room."
"JACK: Actually, room 9 has a better view, and it's closer to the ice machine."
"PARIS: Let's go with 9. Now, who's gonna help with our bags? Good. Okay, those four bags... Uh, Rory, your book bag?"
"RORY: Um, sure."
"JANET: I'm gonna go for a run."
"RORY: Now?"
"JANET: Just a short one around the block."
"RORY: She looks so normal, and then that happens."
"PARIS: Come on. Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that. See, a lot of people make the mistake of tipping at the end of a trip. But I always tip as you go along. That way, they never know when the honey pot dries up, and it keeps them from going through your stuff and robbing you blind. Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that."
"RORY: Oh, man, look at that. We're right on the ocean. Paris, look at it. It's right there."
"PARIS: I see it. Oh, hey, we're in room 9. Feel free to keep the sheets clean and the towels coming. [Goes into room 9] Okay...not bad. Hey, you know what would be swell? A VCR to go with that television set. You mind? You're aces, pal...really. I'm giving the toast at your wedding."
"RORY: Well, at least it doesn't smell bad in here."
"PARIS: Pull your covers down and roll on the bed."
"RORY: Why?"
"PARIS: We are sharing this room with four other girls, Rory. Plus 10K Barbie- we have to stake out our territory."
"RORY: Yes, and then we need to up your dosage."
"PARIS: Look, a person comes in, they see a dent in the bed, possibly a hair on the pillow..."
"RORY: So the person's David Caruso?"
"PARIS: They'll figure that bed is taken. They will then move on to the couch or the rollaway."
"RORY: That's insane."
"PARIS: Okay, suit yourself. [Starts to bounce on the bed. Rory soon follows suit on the other bed.]"
"RORY: And I was worried I would I feel stupid."
"PARIS: Stupid but well rested."
"RORY: How long do we have to do this?"
"PARIS: I think we're good."
"RORY: I'm really comfortable right now."
"PARIS: Yeah, me, too."
"[Indistinct yelling]"
"RORY: Sounds like more are arriving. Where are you going?"
"PARIS: To see what all the ruckus is about."
"RORY: Wait for me- I like ruckus. Man, that's a lot of people stuck in that tiny car."
"PARIS: They should all be wearing Shriner hats."
"[A cute guy walks past.]"
"SEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"PARIS: Hmm, that was subtle."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"PARIS: The Joanie loves Chachi moment."
"RORY: He said ""hey."""
"PARIS: I heard."
"RORY: I said ""hey"" back."
"PARIS: You did."
"RORY: I was being polite."
"PARIS: In Burma, you'd be married...or brutally k*ll."
"RORY: I'm gonna go make your bed."
"PARIS: Don't you dare. Man, I'm thirsty. [Hands money to guy walking by] Root beer?"
"RORY: Paris, that guy doesn't work here."
"PARIS: Not yet. But look at that mug of his, it's only a matter of time."
"CUT TO JASON'S APARTMENT"
"LORELAI: I overslept again."
"JASON: I know."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you get me up?"
"JASON: I tried, and you bit me."
"LORELAI: I did not bite you. [Jason holds out hand, she looks.] I did bite you -- cool!"
"JASON: Here, eat this before it gets cold."
"LORELAI: You made French toast?"
"JASON: Well, I had a lot of energy after my run, so..."
"LORELAI: You went running?"
"JASON: Well, I had to wait for the laundry to dry. And I had already read the papers."
"LORELAI: You had an entire day before I woke up."
"JASON: Here, you want bacon?"
"LORELAI: You went out and slaughtered a pig between the running and the French toast?"
"JASON: Yes, and by the way, that whole ozone-layer problem... taken care of."
"LORELAI: You're my Green Party hero."
"JASON: [Handing her a plate] Here."
"LORELAI: Oh, no - can't. I have to get to the printers and pick up the brochures because today is mailing day. But do you have a baggie?"
"JASON: Uh, yeah, here."
"LORELAI: Perfect. Mmm."
"JASON: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: This is French toast on the go. The other drivers on the road love it. Come here. [Kisses him.] I'll call you later. We'll plan our weekend."
"JASON: [Looking awkward.] Um, hey, Lorelai, hold on a second. Here."
"LORELAI: A key."
"JASON: Yeah, it's a key to the apartment."
"LORELAI: Oh...good. Do you want me to let someone in?"
"JASON: No, it's just an extra key. I thought, you know, if you were coming over and I was running late this way you didn't have to wait in the hallway."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"JASON: Or if you were carrying something, and you couldn't wait for me to get to the door... this way, you're all set."
"LORELAI: Okay...good. Makes sense."
"JASON: Yeah, it's just a practical thing. It's not a big deal."
"LORELAI: Oh, good."
"JASON: Or you don't have to take it."
"LORELAI: No, I'll- I'll take it."
"JASON: I mean, I know how it is. You've got your keys on your ring just so, and then you put in a new one- it throws off the whole balance."
"LORELAI: Well, if you think --"
"JASON: Or you can keep it."
"LORELAI: You sure?"
"JASON: If you want."
"LORELAI: I can go either way."
"JASON: It's fine with me."
"LORELAI: Well, which way?"
"JASON: Either way."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll take it, [Chuckles] Okay? Thanks for the French toast."
"JASON: Uh...thanks for the hand injury."
"LORELAI: Anytime. Bye."
"CUT TO THE BEACH"
"PARIS: Here- it's over here."
"RORY: Whoa, how did we get a tent?"
"PARIS: Toby, again. Classic tip whore."
"RORY: Which one's Toby?"
"PARIS: The one with the bandaged hand. He cut it setting this up. I popped him another sawbuck."
"GLENN: Cool tent! How'd we get it?"
"RORY: Stay ignorant, Glenn. It comes with the oppressive guilt of the ruling class."
"GLENN: Okay. Hey, Janet. I like your suit."
"JANET: Thanks, Glenn."
"GLENN: Hey...hot dogs."
"RORY: Man, it is so loud out here. You never think of the beach as being loud."
"PARIS: You do when there's a band of Huns re-enacting ""Top g*n"" in back of you."
"GUY PLAYING VOLLEYBALL: Hey! Throw it back."
"PARIS: No! [To Rory] What are you doing?"
"RORY: Putting a towel down."
"PARIS: Don't."
"RORY: Why? We have, like, a hundred towels in the room. There's so many towels, there's basically no room for us."
"GUY: I need my ball."
"PARIS: You need a couple of 'em, pal."
"JANET: [Picks up ball & throws it back.] Here. Ignore her. She likes it."
"PARIS: Rory, stop."
"RORY: I'm not gonna sit in the sand, Paris."
"PARIS: [Employees of the Sea Sprite come carrying table & chairs.] Over here. Great...okay. Thanks. Now, we're going to need a fruit plate in about an hour and keep the ice tea coming. [Looks at Rory] What?"
"RORY: Nothing but admiration here."
"JANET: I'm going to go do my laps in the ocean."
"RORY: You're gonna work out on spring break?"
"JANET: Exercise is a high. You should try it."
"RORY: Sure. I'll meet you out there."
"PARIS: Are you properly sun-screened? Ten minutes in the sun can cause irreparable skin damage."
"JANET: And constant shoulder tension creates a hunchback."
"PARIS: Fine, go. I hear melanoma is very in this year. Here, Casper, you better use this."
"RORY: You're just lucky you got a fruit plate coming."
"[Madeline and Louise pull up in lifeguard truck]"
"MADELINE: Rory, Paris! Oh, my God!"
"LOUISE: Hello, ladies!"
"RORY: Unbelievable. What are you guys doing here?"
"MADELINE: Spring break!"
"LOUISE: Actually we came for Tulane's spring break and just stayed."
"MADELINE: We've been here a month."
"LOUISE: They have great lifeguards."
"MADELINE: I'm so excited to see you guys."
"LOUISE: Paris, you missed a spot. I can see skin."
"MADELINE: So, when did you get here?"
"PARIS: 2:00 this morning."
"LOUISE: I love 2:00 in the morning."
"RORY: You guys are having a good time?"
"LOUISE: Uh, way better than most other people."
"MADELINE: We're very competitive."
"LOUISE: It took a couple of weeks to get the right routine down, but now we own this town."
"PARIS: The chamber of commerce must be thrilled."
"LOUISE: I think the last place on earth I would ever expect to find Paris Geller is at spring break."
"PARIS: Hey, I'm up for new things."
"MADELINE: Okay, well then we have to make sure you do this right."
"LOUISE: There are rules."
"RORY: There always are in a civilized society."
"LOUISE: First of all, it is very important to find the right hot club every night and it changes. What was hot last night is not tonight."
"MADELINE: Also, adjust your sleeping patterns for maximum partying. Mid-to-late-afternoon sleeping allows the best all-night stamina."
"RORY: Okay. You got that, Paris?"
"PARIS: Were we really friends at one point?"
"MADELINE: They do card at the clubs, but there's a million ways around it. Major flirting..."
"LOUISE: A sexy voice..."
"MADELINE: And, if all that fails, make out."
"RORY: With who?"
"LOUISE: Each other."
"PARIS: Excuse me?"
"MADELINE: We found that if we kiss each other, we can get anything we want from guys."
"LOUISE: Free drinks, food..."
"MADELINE: T-shirts, boat rides, Frisbees..."
"LOUISE: Earrings, Seadoos..."
"RORY: Okay. Well, that is a good tip."
"PARIS: Yeah, maybe later I'll pants you for an Altoid."
"MADELINE: Hey, where are you staying?"
"RORY: The Sea Sprite."
"MADELINE: That's cute."
"LOUISE: We've made out there."
"MADELINE: Louise, it's 1:00."
"LOUISE: We've got to go get to bed."
"MADELINE: We'll come see you tonight. [To lifeguard truck] Hey, guys!"
"LOUISE: How 'bout a lift?"
"RORY: I liked the pants-you-for-an-Altoid thing."
"CUT TO LATER THAT NIGHT IN HOTEL ROOM."
"RORY: Oh, my God, I'm starving."
"PARIS: I can't believe what a great video store that was."
"RORY: A little research before a trip never hurts."
"PARIS: Pizza and ""The Power of Myth"""
"RORY: A perfect evening. [Sees Paris checking the phone.] What?"
"PARIS: Nothing- just checking the messages, that's all."
"RORY: Are you expecting a call from Asher?"
"PARIS: No, I'm not expecting a call. He's at a conference in Denver, so I'm not expecting a call. I mean, he knows I'm here, and I left him a contact number in case of emergencies, but not expecting a call. [Goes and puts movie in.] God, I love this. I've seen it four times."
"RORY: Five."
"PARIS: Seriously?"
"RORY: It was almost six, but my mom tried to be funny one day and hid it."
"PARIS: I thought you and your mom got along?"
"RORY: Even we have our dark periods. [Looking & listening outside.] Wow, it sounds like quite a party out there."
"PARIS: Yep."
"RORY: I think someone just got thrown in the pool."
"PARIS: I hope it's the guy who took my five bucks and never brought me a root beer."
"RORY: This is a good song. Okay, I'm sorry, are we doing this right?"
"PARIS: Doing what right?"
"RORY: Spring break. I mean, we're in here alone with Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers, and everyone else is out there with..."
"PARIS: Everyone else?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"PARIS: But...we love Bill Moyers."
"RORY: Yes, we do love Bill Moyers. But we did come here for spring break, and I'm just wondering if we're not spring-breaking the way you're supposed to spring break."
"PARIS: You're probably right."
"RORY: I mean, if we're here, we should probably commit."
"PARIS: Try to experience the entire event."
"RORY: With other people, outside this room."
"PARIS: Okay. Let's do it. Let's commit."
"RORY: Okay. Starting now?"
"PARIS: Starting now."
"MAN'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND FROM MOVIE: ...To explain the universe and their place in it. The 20 books he wrote or edited and have influenced artists and performers..."
"RORY: Tomorrow's fine, too."
"PARIS: Absolutely."
"CUT TO RORY, PARIS, MADELINE & LOUISE POOLSIDE."
"MADELINE: I got $5 on the blond with the tattoo."
"LOUISE: You always go for the tattoos."
"PARIS: God, I'm starving. I haven't had anything but vending-machine junk. There's nothing around here. I would k*ll for something non-synthetic. [Gets splashed] Ohh! Perfect."
"RORY: [Talking on cell phone]: Okay, forget I said ""giant Q-tips."" They're not hitting each other with giant Q-tips."
"LORELAI: But now I can't get giant Q-tips out of my head. It's too powerful a visual."
"RORY: I know, I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: So how is it?"
"RORY: It's good so far."
"LORELAI: Yeah, how good?"
"RORY: I haven't had a drink yet."
"LORELAI: Okay, are you sure you weren't drinking, and that's why you think they're giant Q-tips?"
"RORY: [Watching Sean go by] Um...maybe."
"LORELAI: Hello? What just happened?"
"RORY: Hmm?"
"LORELAI: You sound distracted. Did something cute just walk by?"
"RORY: Um...no. No, I was just trying to think of something better to describe the, uh, the giant Q-tips. So I'll call you later, okay?"
"LORELAI: No windows."
"RORY: No windows. [Hangs up. Madeline and Louise stare at her.] What?"
"LOUISE: Excellent taste."
"MADELINE: What's his name?"
"RORY: Whose name?"
"LOUISE: The guy you were just staring at."
"RORY: I wasn't staring."
"MADELINE: [Looks across the pool] Oh, no."
"LOUISE: The twins."
"MADELINE: God, they're everywhere."
"RORY: So?"
"MADELINE: We can't compete against twins."
"LOUISE: Especially once they caught on to the whole kissing thing. Let's find another pool."
"MADELINE: We'll see you guys tonight."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: Hey, why don't you go get us something at the bar?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Then you can go talk to that guy."
"RORY: Uh, that's okay."
"PARIS: Come on- go. Flirting seems to be a very big part of this spring break ritual, and I'm taken. I can't flirt. I have to live vicariously through you."
"RORY: Well..."
"MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: The banana-eating contest is about to start on the upper level."
"PARIS: Oh, real food. Thank god."
"RORY: Um...Paris. [Paris leaves.]"

"CUT TO POOLSIDE BAR"
"RORY: [To Sean] Hey, um, do you know what those things are called that they hit each other in the pool with?"
"SEAN: No, I don't."
"RORY: Oh, just wondering."
"SEAN: Do I lose points for that?"
"RORY: No, no points lost."
"GUY: Hey, Sean, man, come on!"
"SEAN: Comin'. See ya."
"RORY: Oh, okay. See ya."
"[Young men shouting]"
"PARIS: I must be crazy for thinking a banana-eating contest was about eating a banana!"
"CUT TO RORY, PARIS, MADELINE & LOUISE ENTERING CLUB"
"[The band The Shins are playing the club. Madeline & Louise walk up to a random guy, lick his hand with over 21 stamp and press it to theirs]"
"MADELINE: You guys want something?"
"RORY: Maybe later."
"LOUISE: We'll be back."
"[Cheering while The Shins play on stage]"
"RORY: Wow, quite a scene."
"PARIS: Yeah, I guess we found the hot place tonight."
"RORY: Yep, no one can sniff out the hip like we can."
"PARIS: Okay, so, here we are. We should do something."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: I don't know."
"RORY: We could dance."
"PARIS: Dance... okay, sure. Let's- let's dance."
"RORY: Okay, let's dance. [Both start dancing.] This is fun."
"PARIS: Yep. [Sees Sean in the background.] Hey, I think your husband's here."
"RORY: What? Where?"
"PARIS: Why don't you go buy him a drink?"
"RORY: What, like a nice ginger ale?"
"PARIS: Well, maybe you could get Madeline and Louise to buy a drink for you, and then you could go bring it to him."
"RORY: [As Sean walks off] Well, that was the shortest relationship ever."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: He looked, he saw, he changed his mind."
"PARIS: Sorry. [Looks around the club.] Okay, what is going on here?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Why is every single person in this place having a better time than we are?"
"RORY: Well, I don't know that they are."
"PARIS: Look around. Every single person in this place is having a better time than we are. Why? I mean, we've been doing everything everybody else is. We're here, in the hot place."
"RORY: So we're not great dancers. We did the hanging out at the pool part pretty well."
"PARIS: We're not trying hard enough."
"RORY: What are you talking about? This is not a test."
"PARIS: We came here to do spring break, and we are going to do spring break."
"RORY: Well, what else do you suggest we do? [Paris kisses Rory] [Rory squeals] What are you doing? Are you crazy?"
"PARIS: Well, Madeline and Louise do it."
"RORY: Madeline and Louise wear their underwear outside of their clothes. I don't want to do what Madeline and Louise do."
"PARIS: I just thought-"
"RORY: Just stop thinking, okay? Your thinking is very, very dangerous. [Starts to head for the exit]"
"PARIS: Rory..."
"RORY: Get away from me! You're not my type."
"PARIS: Will you just wait?"
"RORY: [Stops] What?"
"PARIS: How was I?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: As a kisser?"
"RORY: [Starts for the exit again] Oh, man!"
"PARIS: Well, I've always wanted to know, and you can't ask a guy 'cause that's a sign of low self esteem, which I've read is really not sexy. So tell me- how am I? Too stiff? Do I need to relax my lips a little, maybe open my mouth more, make it more inviting?"
"RORY: I need some fresh air."
"SEAN: Hey. Where you goin'?"
"RORY: Um, outside."
"SEAN: Can I come with you?"
"RORY: Oh, well..."
"SEAN: Maybe your girlfriend wants to come, too."
"RORY: My girlfriend?"
"SEAN: I gotta tell you- that was some kiss."
"RORY: Oh, my God!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE."
"LORELAI: So the movie was good. Nice to see Michael Caine working again. Which was sarcastic... 'cause he works a lot... constantly. [Chuckles] Never says ""no"" to anything, which can be risky, you know? Lowers your batting average."
"JASON: Well, I'm glad you liked it."
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Jason, you're making me work too hard tonight."
"JASON: [Sighs] I know."
"LORELAI: I mean, I wore the cute boots, you know? Do you see the cute boots?"
"JASON: Very cute boots."
"LORELAI: Well, I've had a full night, what with the walking straight, the balancing, and the not yelping out in pain. If I'd known I'd also had to do all the talking, I-"
"JASON: I think I did it wrong."
"LORELAI: You did what wrong?"
"JASON: The key that I gave you."
"LORELAI: The key...to your apartment?"
"JASON: The key was supposed to say something."
"LORELAI: So it's a talking key."
"JASON: Look, you and I are hitting that point in a relationship where I usually break it off."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, gee, should we get a cake?"
"JASON: Every single time with every other woman I've been involved with, this is about the time that I would..."
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Bolt?"
"JASON: I was gonna say ""run,"" but ""bolt"" sounds much more masculine, so yeah, sure, ""bolt."""
"LORELAI: Well, it's time to bolt. Okay, good thing you're not wearing my boots."
"JASON: [Sighs] I don't think I'm doing this right, either."
"LORELAI: No, no, you're doing it just fine. It's cold, so..."
"JASON: The other night I woke up and the timer went off in my head- ""Hey, buddy, it's about that time."" So I did what I always do. I thought about you, and I thought about us, and I thought about all the things that bother me, and I came up with nothing."
"LORELAI: Nothing?"
"JASON: I went over it and over it in my head. That feeling, that ""I want out"" feeling- it wasn't there. What was there was the very strong sense that if I did...bolt... I might as well go out and find a pointy hat, a stool, and a classroom full of sixth graders, because I'd be an absolute idiot to screw this up. So I went out and made the key."
"LORELAI: The talking key."
"JASON: And I was hoping that the key would say that this is different, and that I want you in my life a lot more than you are now."
"LORELAI: Wow. Well, I mean, it would have been more interesting to hear that from the key... it's definitely more romantic hearing it from you."
"JASON: I'm gonna go take care of Mr. Caine for you now."
"LORELAI: I would appreciate that."
"JASON: Good night."
"LORELAI: Good night, Jason. [Goes inside house, check answering machine]"
"LUKE: [On answering machine] Hey, it's Luke. I'm sorry to be calling you like this, but I was wondering if, when you get this message, you could come pick me up 'cause I need a ride. I'm in Litchfield, the corner of Mason and Pine. It's a big, white building. You'll recognize it by the police sign outside because, oh, hell, I'm in jail. Okay, there I said it. Long story. I'll tell you when you get here. Thanks... if you come. Oh, one more thing. I need to borrow a little money- 300 bucks. It's just a loan, and, oh, hell, it's for my bail. [Yells into background] I'm gettin' off now! Relax!"
"CUT TO POOLSIDE AT SEA SPRITE"
"MADELINE: I think the two of you would make a great couple."
"RORY: No way."
"PARIS: Why not?"
"RORY: You're way too high maintenance for me."
"LOUISE: The whole place was buzzing about the kiss."
"MADELINE: Even the twins were jealous."
"RORY: Super, great. Love to hear that."
"MADELINE: Who needs more? Everybody? Good. I'll be right back."
"LOUISE: So, Paris, how's the Princeton man?"
"PARIS: Jaime and I broke up."
"RORY: Paris has a different man now."
"LOUISE: You do?"
"PARIS: I'm dating a professor."
"LOUISE: Tenured?"
"PARIS: Ages ago."
"LOUISE: [Chuckling] Well, Anna Nicole, look at you."
"PARIS: He's brilliant, a writer, very distinguished, handsome. Don't you think he's handsome?"
"RORY: Handsome? Sure, very handsome."
"PARIS: He's a real man. He's just so amazing. I still can't believe that we're together, you know?"
"MADELINE: I made them a little stronger this time."
"RORY: Oh, cool, it will be fun to watch the cups dissolve."
"LOUISE: Paris bagged herself an older man."
"MADELINE: Oh, I love older men. They take you to the best restaurants."
"PARIS: He went to a conference in Denver this week. He was so nice, you know- really excited about me coming to Florida. He thinks it's a good idea to hang out with people my own age. I kind of hoped that he would invite me to go to Denver with him but, you know, he didn't."
"RORY: He had to work, Paris."
"PARIS: I know, or he's sick of me."
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Maybe he's going to dump me."
"LOUISE: Mmm -- does he still buy you jewelry?"
"PARIS: He's never bought me jewelry."
"MADELINE: He hasn't? How much money does he have?"
"PARIS: Asher isn't rich."
"MADELINE: Not rich?"
"LOUISE: Oh, curiouser and curiouser."
"RORY: You're just being paranoid. He wants you to have fun. And someone who wants you to have fun is someone who cares about you... both of you because there are two of you, and they're spinning."
"[They all laugh.]"
"MADELINE: Good punch."
"RORY: Just keep me away from any windows, please."
"LOUISE: Whatever happened to that boyfriend of yours?"
"RORY: Who, Jess?"
"LOUISE: No."
"RORY: Oh, Dean."
"MADELINE: Dean, that's it."
"LOUISE: How's Dean? God, he was gorgeous."
"RORY: He's fine."
"MADELINE: Is he still gorgeous?"
"RORY: Oh, yes. Definitely, yes."
"LOUISE: You two aren't together?"
"RORY: No, actually he's married."
"MADELINE: What?"
"LOUISE: Why?"
"RORY: Well, he met Lindsay, and they got married. She's pretty, blond, tall, leggy."
"PARIS: Oh, good, just what the world needs -- another one of those."
"RORY: She's nice, too."
"LOUISE: Prediction..."
"MADELINE: She's psychic."
"PARIS: Since when?"
"LOUISE: Since about six months ago. I think it's not gonna last."
"PARIS: Two married 19-year-olds won't make it- boy, that's a risky bet."
"LOUISE: I think it's not gonna last because he was way too in love with you."
"RORY: No. But we've been broken up for a long time."
"LOUISE: But he only had eyes for you, girlfriend- a deep, long, soulful Rory-eyes."
"RORY: No, not anymore."
"PARIS: You don't talk at all anymore?"
"RORY: No, we still talk. We're still friends."
"MADELINE: Yes, you are. Cell phone friends."
"LOUISE: You have your ex-boyfriend's number in your cell phone?"
"RORY: I told you we were friends."
"LOUISE: First loves are very intense."
"MADELINE: My mom's still in love with her first love. She tells my father that over and over and... oops, I think I just dialed his number."
"RORY: Madeline, no!"
"MADELINE: Oh, my God, it's ringing!"
"RORY: Hang up!"
"MADELINE: It's his voice mail. Oh, sexy voice. Oops, I think it's gonna... it beeped."
"MADELINE: Talk."
"RORY: Dean, hi. [Laughs nervously] It's Rory. I'm sorry to call you like this, but we're on spring break... [Laughs] ...And, um, I don't know if you remember Madeline and Louise, but they're evil, and we were just talking about you. Um, hi. How are you? I'm gonna hang up now, so bye. Sorry, good-bye. [To Madeline] I'm going to k*ll you! Oh, my God, I'm so gonna k*ll you! It's going to be bad and death-like, and... I'm gonna go for a walk because this punch is starting to live up to its name."
"PARIS: I'll go with you."
"RORY: Don't move because I'm going to come back to k*ll you."
"MADELINE: We'll be here. [Laughs]"
"CUT TO LUKE & LORELAI OUTSIDE LUKE & NICOLE'S APARTMENT"
"LUKE: There- my truck."
"LORELAI: [Sighs] You know, Luke, you don't have to tell me what happened unless you want to. But I promise I won't ask you about it again... ever... in this lifetime or the next. You know, I'll just tell Shirley MacLaine, ""Hey, look, back off, Shirl. If Luke had wanted me to know, he would have told me back in my other lifetime, and I certainly don't expect-"""
"LUKE: I wanted to see who owned the socks."
"LORELAI: And did you?"
"LUKE: I think so. I just had a feeling tonight. Nicole was kind of vague on her plans, so I told her I'd stay at the diner. And then I drove up here, and I parked, and I waited. And then this car pulled up, and she got out with him. And, uh, they went inside, and I watched them go."
"LORELAI: And you're sure he's the owner of the socks?"
"LUKE: Well, I didn't ask him, but he's the owner of the socks. And if he isn't, the picture's still not looking very good."
"LORELAI: I agree with you there."
"LUKE: Anyway, I sat here and watched them go inside. I had all these thoughts rolling around in my head. I mean, how could she do this, you know? In there- in our house. I mean, I... I put bookshelves up in there."
"LORELAI: If it makes you feel any better, I don't think he's using your bookshelves."
"LUKE: I suddenly just got so mad, you know, I lost it. I had to do something, so I got out and marched up to his car, and I kicked it."
"LORELAI: You kicked his car?"
"LUKE: Oh, hey, I kicked it hard and over and over and over again."
"LORELAI: Oh, you b*at up his car."
"LUKE: And then, all of a sudden, these cops pull up, 'cause some busybody in the neighborhood saw some lunatic attacking a car, and, well, you know the rest."
"LORELAI: Did Nicole see you?"
"LUKE: I don't know. I don't know what she and the sock man saw. It's just...[Sighs] God, I feel like such an idiot. I mean, suddenly I became like one of those guys that gets jealous and, you know, does crazy things."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you weren't ""like"" one of those guys. You were one of those guys."
"LUKE: [Snickers] Yeah, well..."
"LORELAI: Was there any damage?"
"LUKE: No. [Pauses, then gets out of the Jeep]"
"LORELAI: Luke... [She follows] Hey, Luke, where are you going?"
"LUKE: See? Nothing- not a scratch. Those stupid dent-resistant panels."
"LORELAI: This is the car?"
"LUKE: Yes, this is the car. He sat there. She sat there. They got out there, walked up there. I jumped out there, ran up here, was handcuffed there, was driven off there. I went to jail. And you drove all the way up here to get me... and they are still in there!"
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: I mean, I can't believe they're still in there. What are they doing?"
"LORELAI: Luke, come on."
"LUKE: I know what they're doing. But even if you took one of those pills that they were hawking at the super bowl, you know, they should have been done in four or five hours, tops. I mean, that commercial said it all- ""If you're still active after four hours, you should call a damn doctor."""
"LORELAI: Come on, why don't we --"
"LUKE: What are they, talking? Making plans in my house? Damn son of a... [Starts kicking the car.]"
"LORELAI: Luke..."
"LUKE: [continues kicking] You lying piece of sockless garbage! Why don't you take home my socks, too?"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey! Luke- Luke, you were busted already once tonight -- that's it."
"LUKE: All right, I'm fine. I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Pretty soon, that car's gonna start fighting back."
"LUKE: I'm fine...really. I'm fine."
"LORELAI: [Sighs] You know, Luke, I know I've never really been Miss ""This-is-great"" about your relationship, but I am- I am so, so sorry. You don't deserve this. You really don't deserve this."
"LUKE: Yeah. [Sighs] I guess that's it."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Well, at least I finally got to see your house."
"CUT TO RORY AND PARIS WALKING DOWN TO THE BEACH."
"PARIS: Whoo, fresh air is good."
"RORY: Fresh air is healthy."
"PARIS: I'm feeling better."
"RORY: Gotta sit."
"PARIS: Me too."
"RORY: What was in the punch? Did we ask?"
"PARIS: Nope."
"RORY: Should we have asked?"
"PARIS: That's not what the cool kids do."
"RORY: I'm loving the spinning beach. How about you?"
"PARIS: Oh, yeah."
"RORY: So are we done?"
"PARIS: With what?"
"RORY: Spring break. Are we done?"
"PARIS: I don't know."
"RORY: Well, let's go down the list."
"PARIS: Okay, we came."
"RORY: Check."
"PARIS: We danced."
"RORY: Check."
"PARIS: We drank."
"RORY: Check."
"PARIS: We...threw up."
"RORY: We didn't throw up."
"PARIS: Give us 10 more minutes."
"RORY: Right."
"PARIS: Basically, we're done."
"RORY: I feel like we have officially participated."
"PARIS: We've experienced the entire social ritual."
"RORY: I have absolutely no desire to ever feel this way again."
"PARIS: Let's go home."
"RORY: How? We're supposed to stay the rest of the weekend."
"PARIS: Frequent-flyer miles, baby."
"RORY: Cool peanuts. I'm in."
"PARIS: Great. I'll call as soon as I can get up."
"RORY: [Looking at ocean] What's that?"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Oh, my God! Glenn! What happened to you?"
"PARIS: The last time we saw you, you went to get a hot dog."
"GLENN: [emerging from the water] Hot dog? Hot dog. Hot dog. [Runs up the beach toward the hotel crazily.] Ahhhh! Ahh! Ahhhhhh! Ahh! Ahhhhhhh!"
"RORY: You gotta admit, it's been a pretty good trip."
"CUT TO LORELAI [AT HOME] & RORY [AT YALE] ON THE PHONE"
"LORELAI: So I call this place where you were supposedly staying, and some punk at the desk tells me-"
"RORY: I said I was sorry."
"LORELAI: ""I'm sorry, ma'am, she's not here anymore."" My-my-my heart flew out of my chest. And not just because he called me ""ma'am."" Which by the way, I hate."
"RORY: I didn't mean to freak you out."
"LORELAI: You don't take off without telling Mommy."
"RORY: I love that I didn't have to clear it with you to go on spring break, but I had to clear it with you to come home."
"LORELAI: I had visions of you being swallowed by a whale or taking off with some surfers to go chase the perfect wave and not inviting me."
"RORY: It just got to be way too much fun."
"LORELAI: Yeah? How much is ""too much?"""
"RORY: I had a drink."
"LORELAI: And?"
"RORY: Paris and I took turns throwing up."
"LORELAI: That's the way you girls will find yourselves a husband."
"RORY: It was fine- aspirin, tons of water, mac and cheese..."
"LORELAI: Ahh, my baby's discovered her first hangover food. I wish I had a picture to put next to your clay handprint."
"RORY: I think I still have the box."
"LORELAI: Send it to me. So how was it?"
"RORY: It was interesting, you know? We sat on the beach, went to a club, we watched ""The Power of Myth,"" Paris and I kissed..."
"LORELAI: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You watched ""The Power of Myth""?"
"RORY: [The other phone line beeps.] Hold on a sec."
"LORELAI: I hid that from you!"
"RORY: Hello?"
"DEAN: Hey, Rory, it's me."
"RORY: Hi, um, Dean. Hold on a sec. Mom, I have to call you back."
"LORELAI: You did not spend spring break with Bill Moyers."
"RORY: Bye. [To Dean] Hi."
"DEAN: So, uh, I got your message."
"RORY: Oh, yeah?"
"DEAN: Yeah. [Chuckling] It sounds like you were, uh, having a pretty good time out there. And I got a lot of questions. I even wrote a couple down. Are you ready?"

"OPEN AT LUKE'S DINER"
"LORELAI: All right, Davey, here comes the airplane."
"JACKSON: What did they say to kids to get them to open their mouths before there were planes?"
"SOOKIE: ""Here comes the choo-choo."""
"JACKSON: And before there were trains?"
"LORELAI: ""Here comes the spoon."""
"JACKSON: That's so on the nose."
"LORELAI: One more bite, honey. Come on, now. Here comes the airplane again. It's flying through the air. It's beginning its descent. It's commencing its approach. It's lowering the landing gear."
"LUKE: [approaches the table]. It's signaled the ground crew. They're flipping their flashlight thingies. Would you shove that in the kid's mouth?"
"LORELAI: Oh, look -- it's Bilbo Baloneypuss just in from the shire."
"LUKE: Just hurry up and order."
"LORELAI: What's the rush?"
"LUKE: I don't like babies."
"JACKSON: [jumps to his feet] Hey! Huh. I suddenly felt violently protective. [pause] It's gone. [sits again]"
"LUKE: It's the noise they make."
"LORELAI: This baby has not made a peep."
"LUKE: He will and at the worst possible moment."
"LORELAI: Like when you're defusing a b*mb or something?"
"SOOKIE: [gasps] That would be awkward."
"LUKE: You've got one minute to order, then six minutes to eat."
"LORELAI: Yessiree, come on down to Luke's, where the motto is ""eat it, then b*at it."""
"LUKE: One minute."
"[Taylor enters wearing a toupee.]"
"TAYLOR: Hello, all."
"LORELAI: Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Top o' the morning to you."
"LORELAI: Top o' the -"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, on top there, you got the -"
"JACKSON: It's definitely -- it's a -"
"SOOKIE: Beautiful top. It's --"
"LORELAI: Top o' the morning right back at you. You were just on a cruise, weren't you?"
"TAYLOR: Yes, and it was heaven. The Caribbean -- ever been?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. What did you say?"
"TAYLOR: Ever been to the Caribbean?"
"LORELAI: God, I'm sorry. I missed it again."
"TAYLOR: Never mind. Uh, Luke, I have an issue I need to discuss with you."
"LUKE: Good -- something to write about in my diary."
"TAYLOR: There is a distinct odor outside our establishments, and I have to assume it's coming from the diner."
"LUKE: There's no odor coming from my diner."
"TAYLOR: It wasn't there when I left for my trip. Where else could it be emanating from?"
"LUKE: I don't know. Have you checked underneath that thing on your head?"
"TAYLOR: I'm combing it differently."
"LUKE: The comb didn't loosen the glue?"
"JACKSON: You know, I smelled something, too, but it was across the square."
"SOOKIE: Me, too, over by the hair stand -- newsstand."
"MAN SITTING AT COUNTER: I smelled it by Gypsy's -- horrible."
"TAYLOR: So the whole town smells? How can that be possible?"
"LORELAI: It is an old town -- 200 years."
"JACKSON: So, it's decaying from age?"
"TAYLOR: Or we've got skunks again."
"KIRK: [from a nearby table] I think you're right, Taylor!"
"TAYLOR: Ten years ago we got infested. They crawled under houses, met their fate, and the town smelled for weeks."
"KIRK: That must be it, Taylor! Good work. Good work!"
"TAYLOR: Thank you, Kirk. I'm going to have to mobilize the community. We've got the flower show coming up. We have to deal with this quickly."
"KIRK: Let me go door to door and make sure every townsman looks under his house, Taylor. I'll even knock some heads together -- get medieval on their ass."
"TAYLOR: That's a nice offer, Kirk, but the block captains will see it gets done. I better start making my calls. [leaves]"
"LUKE: [walks back to the table] Your minute's up. Order."
"LORELAI: We're not ready."
"LUKE: Then it's coming out of your eating time."
"SOOKIE: Hey, get violently protective so Luke will back off."
"JACKSON: I don't know if I can summon it like that."
"SOOKIE: Try."
"JACKSON: Argh-eee! Luke."
"LUKE: In five minutes, you're all gone. [walks off]"
"JACKSON: [ Sighs ] I let you down."
"LORELAI: The ""argh"" was good, and then you kind of petered out."
"JACKSON: I need to practice more."
"SOOKIE: You'll get it there."
"LORELAI: Read, read. [glancing nervously at impatient Luke]"
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Michel and Dean are moving a bookcase.]"
"LORELAI: Try it against that wall there."
"MICHEL: We've already tried it there."
"DEAN: It's no problem."
"MICHEL: No problem for you, but this is giving me cuticle damage. Do you know how long cuticle damage takes to heal?"
"DEAN: Thank God, no."
"LORELAI: No, it doesn't work there either."
"MICHEL: What an enormous shock. Anywhere else you want to try it -- maybe at the Lincoln Memorial on his giant lap?"
"LORELAI: How 'bout over there?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, there."
"MICHEL: I'm sending you my manicure bill."
"DEAN: Yes, mine, too."
"MICHEL: Don't be snotty."
"TOM: [enters carrying clipboard] Seems a little out of place no matter where you put it."
"LORELAI: Yeah, unfortunately."
"TOM: If you'd ordered it from me, I would have guaranteed it. You didn't order it from me."
"LORELAI: I know, we ordered it before we hired you. We should have waited."
"TOM: It's always best to do it through your contractor. [exits]"
"DEAN: I don't think it fits here."
"MICHEL: Oh, my God, I'm getting a blister."
"SOOKIE: Hey, how about by the front desk?"
"LORELAI: We could give it a sh*t."
"MICHEL: That's it! I'm jumping off the Amistad. This is heavy, my back hurts, I'm not moving it again."
"DEAN: No problem. [grabs bookcase] I can do it. [carries to front desk]"
"MICHEL: It's not me. It really is heavy."
"DEAN: You mean here?"
"TOM: They already tried it there."
"SOOKIE: I think it's a lost cause."
"LORELAI: We've got the Dennis Kucinich of bookcases."
"TOM: I wish you'd gone through me."
"LORELAI: I could just give it to Rory. She could use it at Yale."
"LINDSAY: [enters from front door] Hi, everybody."
"SOOKIE & LORELAI: Hi!"
"LINDSAY: Hi, Michel."
"MICHEL: Hi, Lindsay. [standing slightly hunched]"
"LINDSAY: Are you okay? You're standing kind of funny."
"MICHEL: It's nothing funny. It is how you stand in these pants."
"[Lindsay walks over to Dean]"
"LINDAY: Keys, please."
"DEAN: You got it. [They kiss.]"
"[Sookie and Lorelai watch from afar]"
"LORELAI: Annette and Frankie really found each other."
"SOOKIE: They float together. Y'know, they just sort of float."
"LORELAI: It's off-the-charts adorable."
"MICHEL: [frowning] Yep. The Deans of the world always get the Lindsays. The pretty little things just like the bookcase lifters."
"LORELAI: That's a category -- jocks, nerds, bookcase lifters?"
"MICHEL: I was born with this bad back. It was heretical."
"LORELAI: Congenital."
"MICHEL: Ugh! Well, I hate that bookcase. I wish you had never ordered it. I wish you had never thought of it. I can't even be in the same room with it, mocking me for how alone I am."
"LORELAI: It's mocking you?"
"SOOKIE: It's three pieces of wood."
"MICHEL: Well, I hate it -- hate it, hate it, hate it!"
"TOM: [appears] If you had ordered it from me, he wouldn't be experiencing this psychological trauma."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE DINING ROOM"
"LORELAI: I mean, they were extremely common until just recently -- historically recently, not recently like ""metrosexual is a word now"" recently, but recently."
"EMILY: Are we still talking about anvils?"
"LORELAI: Yes, where did all the anvils go?"
"EMILY: You're talking about those big, heavy, metal things?"
"LORELAI: That blacksmiths hammered horseshoes and stuff on. Everyone had them. They were featured prominently in every movie western, so where did they all go?"
"RICHARD: I don't know that they were that common."
"LORELAI: Wile E. Coyote used them. That's how common they were."
"EMILY: Who?"
"LORELAI: The cartoon. He was always trying to drop an anvil on the Road Runner's head or sh**t it at him out of a giant slingshot or fire it at him out of a cannon. Inevitably, the cannon tilted up, sh*t it in the air, it fell down, and made an anvil-shaped impression on Wile E. Coyote's head."
"EMILY: This is a cartoon?"
"LORELAI: No, no, this just happened to me the other day. I was walking down the street, and this giant anvil -- yes, mother, it's a cartoon."
"RORY: I know she sounds nuts, but it's a very common cartoon."
"RICHARD: But that doesn't prove that anvils were so common."
"LORELAI: It does. It proves that anvils were so ubiquitous at one point -- is that the word, ubiquitous?"
"RORY: It depends on where you're going."
"LORELAI: That they knew that children would know what they were and delight in them. That's how common they were -- children watching cartoons."
"RORY: That was the word."
"RICHARD: I've forgotten your point."
"LORELAI: Where are all the anvils? I mean, is there some sort of secret anvil storage facility the government is keeping from us?"
"RICHARD: Or they fell into disuse with the advent of other technologies, and so they melted them down and they're gone."
"LORELAI: But they're not supposed to melt. They were made to withstand the red-hot hammer of the town blacksmith."
"EMILY: This is easily the most pointless conversation we've ever had."
"LORELAI: I don't hear anyone chiming in with rational theories."
"EMILY: Please change the subject, I beg of you, anyone."
"RICHARD: Well the girls don't know the big news about Jason and me."
"LORELAI: You're pregnant?"
"RICHARD: We're acquiring another company."
"LORELAI: I was close."
"RORY: Already? You just started yours."
"RICHARD: The insurance business is changing so rapidly, you have to adapt to keep up."
"RORY: It's a dog-eat-dog world, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Don't get the wrong idea. It's not a big company. It's smaller than ours, but very powerful."
"LORELAI: Wait, the company is smaller than yours? Your company is two guys -- you and Jason."
"RICHARD: This company is a one-man operation -- Bob Sutton."
"LORELAI: So, you're acquiring Bob?"
"RICHARD: We're acquiring his company, and his company is him."
"LORELAI: Did he have to give himself two weeks' notice? [Rory snickers.]"
"RICHARD: No."
"LORELAI: Is there gonna be a sad little going-away party where he brings in his own cake and blows out his candles?"
"RICHARD: We are all celebrating with a dinner tomorrow -- us and the wives."
"EMILY: Ugh."
"LORELAI: You're not big on the Bob?"
"EMILY: Bob's fine. We've known him for years. It's that dolt he's married to -- classic trophy wife."
"RICHARD: She is quite young."
"LORELAI: How young?"
"EMILY: Her car looks [high, squeaky voice] just like Barbie's."
"RICHARD: Regardless, I hope you will be kind to her at dinner."
"EMILY: I'll have to bring my English-to-dumbbell dictionary."
"RICHARD: Try and focus on Bob. Bob's as sharp as they come."
"EMILY: He's very brilliant, I'll give you that."
"LORELAI: Bob's brilliant, huh?"
"RICHARD: He's a Rhodes scholar."
"LORELAI: Ask him where the anvils went. …Or not."
"CUT TO TAYLORS SWEETS SHOP"
"TAYLOR: And forty-seven cents comes to $5. Thank you, Mrs. Cassini."
"MRS. CASSINI: Thank you. I don't know what it is about you, Taylor, but you look so healthy, so invigorated, so youthful."
"TAYLOR: Thank you, Mrs. Cassini. [big grin] Must be the vacation."
"MRS. CASSINI: Or the fake hair."
"TAYLOR: [smile disolves] Come again, Mrs. Cassini. Tracy, change out the scoop water. It's an unsightly color. And tell Franklin when he gets here - [sees Kirk hovering] tell him that he keeps forgetting to punch out -- Kirk, something wrong?"
"KIRK: Well, I-I - [fiddles nervously]"
"TAYLOR: don't touch the candy."
"KIRK: I'm sorry. I didn't want to touch the candy. It's just…"
"TAYLOR: Kirk, I just had a spat with my sourball distributor, and I'm not in the mood. Now, what's the trouble?"
"KIRK: It's eggs."
"TAYLOR: What? What's eggs?"
"KIRK: In the square -- the smell. It's not skunks, it's eggs. Easter eggs from the Easter egg hunt."
"TAYLOR: But Easter was over a week ago."
"KIRK: And I did it just like you told me. I personally hid 300 eggs around the town square, and the kids had a blast hunting them down, except the Banyan boys. They're bad seeds. Going to hell -- both of them. But the kids only found 241 of them."
"TAYLOR: Are you telling me that there are fifty-nine rotting eggs hidden in the square?"
"KIRK: I thought they would naturally decompose and just disappear."
"TAYLOR: Eggs smell when they decompose."
"KIRK: I just found that out. [Angry and speechless, Taylor walks away. Kirk follows him.] I find your hair very believable."
"CUT TO EXCLUSIVE GOLF COURSE ON FAIRWAY"
"[Richard completes his drive with big swing.]"
"JASON: Nice sh*t. Beautiful!"
"RICHARD: You're being extremely charitable."
"JASON: Oh, Richard, if I get that far on four shots, it would be a miracle on the order of loaves and fishes."
"BOB: Yeah, and I'm in the sand."
"RICHARD: I don't think any of us are gonna make Tiger shake in his spikes."
"JASON'S CADDY: I'd go with a driver or 3-wood."
"JASON: Whatever is gonna make me look less like Dorf."
"BOB: You know, my wife's very excited about the merger, Richard -- very excited."
"RICHARD: Oh, do give Trish our best. Emily and I were just talking about her -- terrific girl."
"[Jason swings and misses ball. Bob and Richard laugh.]"
"BOB: At least he held onto the club this time."
"RICHARD: Now, it's hard to know whether he should yell ""fore!"" Or ""duck!"""
"JASON: Why can't businessmen do deals over air hockey? I am great at air hockey. [A man approaches the group.]Oh, looky here."
"RICHARD: Hmm? Your father?"
"JASON: One of the many hazards on this golf course."
"FLOYD: I thought that was you. Groundskeeper must be unhappy that you're here today."
"JASON: Aha. Divots -- I do produce a lot of divots. Good one."
"FLOYD: Richard, nice to see you. [approaches and shakes hands]"
"RICHARD: Same here, Floyd."
"FLOYD: And, Bob, didn't know you were a duffer."
"BOB: More like spoiling a good walk."
"RICHARD: You want to play through, Floyd?"
"FLOYD: Actually, I was heading back to the clubhouse, and you caught my eye. How's Emily?"
"RICHARD: She's fine."
"FLOYD: Good health?"
"RICHARD: Very good. And Carol?"
"FLOYD: Fine, fine. You know, she really misses Emily -- misses her company."
"RICHARD: And vice versa, I'm sure."
"FLOYD: You couldn't drag those two apart at a function."
"RICHARD: They were like conjoined twins."
"FLOYD: I know she'd love to see Emily again."
"RICHARD: I'm sure the feeling is mutual."
"FLOYD: Well, then, perhaps we should get those two together."
"RICHARD: Well, we could arrange that."
"FLOYD: I can tell Carol to give her a call."
"RICHARD: Any time."
"FLOYD: You know, if it's a meal, we men could tag along if they'd let us."
"RICHARD: That's a big ""if,"" but that could happen."
"FLOYD: Maybe Jason could tag along, too."
"RICHARD: That would be a nice little gathering."
"FLOYD: I'm out of town next week, but this Friday's free."
"RICHARD: Friday would be perfect."
"FLOYD: I hope it happens."
"RICHARD: I hope so, too."
"FLOYD: Glad to run into you."
"RICHARD: Same here, Floyd."
"FLOYD: Bob, Jason. [leaves]"
"RICHARD: [joins Jason] He wants to have dinner."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOUSE - KITCHEN"
"EMILY: Was it Carol's idea or Floyd's?"
"RICHARD: It's hard to say."
"JASON: This is very good, Richard."
"RICHARD: It was public. The whole club saw."
"EMILY: But did he say that Carol had wanted it or that he had wanted it? [to Jason] What did you hear?"
"JASON: I was out of earshot."
"RICHARD: Rapprochement with Floyd Stiles. Never in my wildest dreams."
"JASON: And it came from him. Who saw this coming?"
"EMILY: Did he bring up Carol before or after he brought up the dinner?"
"RICHARD: I didn't have a tape recorder, Emily."
"EMILY: I'll offer to host it here. I've got the perfect menu. Friday, right? So it's Lorelai and Rory, too."
"RICHARD: Well, Friday was his suggestion. I wasn't in a position to counter."
"EMILY: No, of course not. That's fine."
"RICHARD: And he saw us with Bob, too."
"JASON: And still he made the offer."
"RICHARD: Acquiring Bob was a great idea."
"EMILY: There'll be seven of us. That's an unbalanced table, but that's okay. Oh, this is wonderful!"
"RICHARD: Floyd wants peace."
"JASON: So it seems."
"[Richard chuckles.]"
"CUT TO RORY'S YALE DORM ROOM"
"[Rhythmic knocking on door]"
"RORY: [opens door] Dean."
"DEAN: Surprise."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"DEAN: Um, I come bearing gifts."
"RORY: A bookcase?"
"DEAN: [carries it into dorm] Yeah, the one from the inn. Do you see what's going on out there?"
"[They both look into the hallway where Glenn struggles to drag a beer keg up the stairs.]"
"GLENN: [muttering to himself] Almost there, almost there. [breathing heavily as another student passes him on stairs] Thanks for the help."
"DEAN: Should I give him a hand?"
"RORY: If he doesn't work for his inebriation, he won't appreciate it. There's a big party on Friday night. It must be for that."
"DEAN: Yeah? You going?"
"RORY: I have two papers due, so I'll be in Stars Hollow avoiding the fray. I'll just have a brewski there."
"DEAN: [ Laughs ] So, uh, which way's your room?"
"RORY: Thataway. [Dean carries the bookcase to her room.]"
"RORY: So, where did this come from?"
"DEAN: Well, your mom had it made for the Dragonfly, but it didn't fit, so she thought you could use it here. She didn't tell you?"
"RORY: Nope."
"DEAN: Small."
"RORY: Yes."
"DEAN: There's no place to put this."
"RORY: Yes again."
"DEAN: What was your mom thinking?"
"RORY: That I have books, and that's probably the extent of it."
"DEAN: Right. So, I guess I'll take it back."
"RORY: I'm sorry you had to make the trip."
"DEAN: No, it's okay. It's kind of nice seeing where you live."
"RORY: So, are you on your way back to school?"
"DEAN: Oh, no, I'm just off from work. I'm actually gonna take a little break from that."
"RORY: From what, school?"
"DEAN: Yeah, just for a semester or two, you know."
"RORY: A semester or two? But I thought it was going so well."
"DEAN: It was. It's just that Lindsay and I really need some extra money right now, and this job with Tom has been perfect."
"RORY: Extra money for what?"
"DEAN: What do you mean? For life, things."
"RORY: What kind of things?"
"DEAN: Well, um, Lindsay's got her heart set on having a townhouse by the end of the year, and we're kind of cramped where we are, so I think it's a good idea."
"RORY: You do?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"RORY: I don't."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: I think it's a horrible idea."
"DEAN: It's just temporary."
"RORY: Maybe."
"DEAN: Rory."
"RORY: A lot of people who drop out say that it's just temporary. It usually doesn't work out that way."
"DEAN: I'm gonna go back."
"RORY: I hope so."
"DEAN: Have some faith, will you?"
"RORY: I just think this is a mistake."
"DEAN: Rory, I'm married, remember? I have responsibilities."
"RORY: You'll lose your momentum."
"DEAN: I need the money."
"RORY: Can't the townhouse wait?"
"DEAN: Jeez, lighten up."
"RORY: I just think this is a really bad idea."
"DEAN: Graduating from college doesn't guarantee you a job anymore. It's not like it was with our parents."
"RORY: So you're not going back?"
"DEAN: You're twisting my words."
"RORY: And you're just gonna work in construction?"
"DEAN: What, are you gonna get all elitist on me now?"
"RORY: We're friends, so I get to tell you what I think."
"DEAN: Fine."
"RORY: You should go to school."
"DEAN: Great. Now you've told me three times. I get it. You don't need to tell me again, okay? [long pause] You want me to take this now?"
"RORY: Yes...no. Whatever you want."
"DEAN: I'll take it now."
"RORY: Fine."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE"
"[A crowd has gathered.]"
"TAYLOR: Attention, please! Everybody, if I may!"
"KIRK: [yelling above the crowd's murmuring] Let's have some attention, people!"
"TAYLOR: We all know why we're here. There are fifty-nine rotting Easter eggs hidden throughout the square, and we've got to find them. I know what you're thinking -- what about the map, the careful, detailed map of where the eggs are hidden made each year to avoid catastrophes such as this? [Kirk stares at his shoes] Well, a map was not made this year, good townsfolk. One was not made. Now, this work is going to be exhausting and, yes, disgusting, but as my way of thanking you, help yourself to lunch at Doose's market, where everything in our prepared-foods section will be discounted 5%, 20% for our day-old sushi. Now, with the flower show due in three days, we have a clock on this, people, but when I look out at this fine group of volunteers, my heart races with pride. I see America, and I am proud. Now, are there any questions?"
"GYPSY: What's with the toupee? [crowd laughs]"
"TAYLOR: It's not a toupee."
"GYPSY: And I'm blond and leggy."
"TAYLOR: Are there any legitimate questions from anyone? [ man raises his hand ] Yes, Joe?"
"JOE: I'm Jewish."
"TAYLOR: Well, that's swell."
"JOE: Is it okay for a Jew to hunt Easter eggs?"
"TAYLOR: That's between you and your Rabbi. [Jackson raises his hand] Jackson, a question?"
"JACKSON: Toupee guy says what?"
"TAYLOR: What? [laughter from crowd] What are you laughing about?"
"KIRK: Jackson said, ""Toupee guy says what?"" Inspiring your understandable response of ""what?"" Thus soliciting their childish laughter. It's infantile and a total clam."
"TAYLOR: Please report every found egg to me, and I will keep the running total. Now, good luck, and let the hunt begin."
"KIRK: We won't let you down, Taylor, because not only are we gonna find twenty eggs within the hour, [voice raises louder] but we're going on to find twenty-five... and then thirty... and then thirty-five... and then forty... [at the top of his lungs] and then forty-five and then fifty until we find all fifty-nine and take back the square! Yeeeeee-ahhhhh!"
"JACKSON: Hurt your throat?"
"KIRK: [hoarsely] Very badly."
"JOE: Found one!"
"TAYLOR: Fifty-eight to go."
"KIRK: [ Hoarsely ] Good job, Joe. [proceeds to run madly through the crowd around the square]"
"CUT TO JASON'S TOWNHOUSE -- KITCHEN"
"JASON: Okay, dinner is ready when the cow moos."
"LORELAI: Mmm. Okay. [carrying potted plant] How about here? [set plant under stairs]"
"JASON: Not there."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"JASON: It's dark."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that's the point. It's a dark corner. The plant livens it up."
"JASON: Plants need light."
"LORELAI: They do?"
"JASON: It's the ""photo"" part of photosynthesize."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't some plants just synthesize?"
"JASON: They really need the photo part."
"LORELAI: None of the plants I ever had needed light."
"JASON: Any of them live?"
"LORELAI: No. [brief pause] Whoa, insight!"
"JASON: Poor thing doesn't stand a chance."
"LORELAI: Hey, so, you ready for Friday?"
"JASON: Ohh, dinner with my parents?"
"LORELAI: You haven't seen them in a while."
"JASON: Well, I've seen Mom occasionally, but Floyd and I really haven't spoken since the great schism, not that Harry Chapin isn't dying to rise from the grave and write a song about us. I'm a little nervous."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I get that."
"JASON: And he's gonna call me ""Digger."" Oh, he loves calling me ""Digger."" And he has hated every girl I have ever dated."
"LORELAI: Um, really?"
"JASON: Yeah, mom, too. It's some sort of reverse Oedipal thing. And not just the ones I pick. They set me up with a girl they loved, and as soon as they found out I liked her, they turned on her viciously. She moved to Alaska."
"LORELAI: Why are you telling me this?"
"JASON: Just a heads up."
"LORELAI: All it's gonna do is make me nervous, and it has."
"JASON: They don't know I'm going out with you, so it doesn't matter."
"LORELAI: Well, they'll find out eventually."
"JASON: Well, impress them now when they don't know. Preempt their gathering hatred."
"LORELAI: Unless they end up hating me retroactively."
"JASON: Oh, I have seen that, too."
"LORELAI: Tony Robbins has nothing on you. [walks into living room]"
"JASON: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Ooh, how about here? [sets plant on chair]"
"JASON: On the chair?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's not a very comfortable chair."
"JASON: How about I just get a new chair?"
"LORELAI: That'll work."
"JASON: You know, in a warped way, you being nervous has made me less nervous."
"LORELAI: So there's a bright side."
"JASON: Not that that was my intent."
"LORELAI: Good to know. [cow moos in background ]"
"JASON: Dinner."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW MAIN STREET"
"LANE: There was a death-to-disco movement in the late '70s -- very intense. We had Donna Summer on the run."
"RORY: ""We?"" You weren't born yet."
"LANE: I'm a kindred spirit."
"RORY: Gotcha."
"LANE: So where's the passion now, huh? Where is it?"
"RORY: There's disco to k*ll anymore. They wiped it out."
"LANE: But there are other things that need wiping out -- phony rappers, most techno, alt country, Christian rock, anything fusion, classic alternative radio, where all they do is play the same Nirvana song over and over -- the Rubens, the Clays, the Clarksons. [they stroll past the center square where people still wander in search of eggs]"
"RORY: It's gonna be a bloodbath. What are they doing?"
"LANE: You smell that smell?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LANE: Taylor left Kirk in charge of the Easter egg hunt, and they didn't exactly find them all."
"RORY: They lose the egg map?"
"LANE: They didn't make an egg map."
"RORY: They didn't make an egg map?"
"LANE: I was just as shocked."
"RORY: They always make an egg map."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Taylor patrols the square with Joe and Kirk following]"
"TAYLOR: Let's have the hourly report, Joe."
"JOE: Well, you know -"
"KIRK: [interrupting] We found three more, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I said, ""Joe."""
"JOE: We found three more, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: That's not good! That is not good! More than half are still missing, and every minute we have people deserting the cause. [stops in front of tree] What's this?"
"JACKSON: There's a couple in the tree. [Gypsy assists Jackson while he prods branches with a long pole)"
"TAYLOR: You hid them in a tree?"
"KIRK: Oh, right."
"TAYLOR: They're completely out of reach of the children."
"KIRK: The others I hid for the delight of the children. These I hid for me."
"TAYLOR: [sighs] Get them down. This is not good. We are losing men, and we are losing -"
"JACKON and GYPSY: [simultaneously] Hair!"
"TAYLOR: Time."
"JACKON and GYPSY: [simultaneously] Jinx, jinx, jinx, jinx! jinx, jinx, jinx, jinx!"
"TAYLOR: [groaning] Oh, I miss the Caribbean. [walks off]"
"[CUTS TO DOOSE'S MARKET]"
"[Rory and Lane enter and wander aisles with shopping baskets]"
"RORY: So, what are we looking for?"
"LANE: Well, we still have no fridge, no stove, and no microwave, so nothing perishable, nothing that requires boiling water, and nothing that needs to be cooked."
"RORY: I'm guessing the day-old sushi is out."
"LANE: It was never in."
"RORY: Beef jerky?"
"LANE: Definitely."
"RORY: And protein bars."
"LANE: Oh, I'm sorry. When did I win the lottery?"
"RORY: Protein bars are a luxury?"
"LANE: They are when you live with guys that eat ten of everything when one's the correct portion. Got to keep that proportion cost low."
"RORY: Pretzels."
"LANE: Perfect."
"RORY: And, of course, the perennial Pop-tart."
"LANE: Oh, load up on those."
"RORY: Did I tell you that Dean stopped by?"
"LANE: Where, Yale?"
"RORY: He was delivering a bookcase for my mom. Hey, you want a bookcase? It's free."
"LANE: I'll take it. So, how's old Dean-boy doing?"
"RORY: He dropped out of college."
"LANE: What? You're kidding!"
"RORY: Says he needs money. How about marshmallows?"
"LANE: Sure, and throw in a Park Avenue mansion while you're at it."
"RORY: Another luxury -- got it."
"LANE: So, he's just working full-time?"
"RORY: It's such a waste. Dean is so smart. He can do so much more. Hey, melba toast."
"LANE: Cheap, tasteless, and filling."
"RORY: I'll grab a bunch."
"LANE: And I'll get one bag of marshmallows so the boys can have a treat afterwards."
"RORY: I'm mad at Dean about doing this, but I'm more mad at Lindsay. She's so selfish."
"LANE: Women."
"RORY: She's his wife. She should be encouraging him to go to school and think about his future, but, no, she needs a townhouse and a Rolls-Royce."
"LANE: [incredulous] They're buying a Rolls-Royce? [they continue strolling down aisle]"
"RORY: No, but they are the townhouse, and he didn't even seem that excited about it. It's just Lindsay. I mean, why doesn't she get a job. [they turn corner] What does she do all day? [Lindsay stands in the aisle speechless. After a pause she stomps off and out of the store.] So, you think -- you think she heard?"

"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Kirk stumbles in looking dazed.]"
"LUKE: Kirk?"
"KIRK: That's me."
"LUKE: You want something?"
"KIRK: Why?"
"LUKE: Well, you usually get something here. You're in the diner."
"KIRK: Oh, yes."
"LUKE: Kirk?"
"KIRK: That's me."
"LUKE: You want some coffee?"
"KIRK: Yes, please."
"LUKE: Your eyes are spinning in different directions."
"KIRK: I've been up for one and a half days straight. I haven't done that since the ""Petticoat Junction"" marathon in '97."
"LUKE: Right. Caught a little of that myself."
"[He guides Kirk to a chair. Taylor enters the diner.]"
"TAYLOR: Luke, turkey sandwich on rye, please -- lettuce, tomato, cucumber."
"LUKE: Coming right up."
"KIRK: We're gonna do it, Taylor! We're gonna find those last twelve eggs!"
"TAYLOR: [ignores Kirk] Cole slaw, too."
"KIRK: Every last one of them!"
"TAYLOR: And a pickle -- make it two."
"KIRK: Joe and I can divide the square in two and sweep it clean till the job's done."
"TAYLOR: I'm going to pay now and wait outside if you don't mind. [places sugar container on top of his money]"
"LUKE: I guess not."
"KIRK: I'll take the east side, he'll take the west. That way we can --"
"TAYLOR: [slams sugar container on the counter] That's enough, Kirk!"
"KIRK: Hey, watch it."
"TAYLOR: You're not satisfied that I'm suffering for what you've done to this town. You have to continue to personally torture me?"
"KIRK: We'll find the twelve!"
"TAYLOR: We won't find the twelve! You have brought disaster down upon us! Are you happy?!"
"KIRK: No."
"TAYLOR: I left you in charge of things because I thought I could trust you, but you let me down. Now I have to cancel the flower show."
"KIRK: No."
"TAYLOR: I'm making the call tomorrow. The flower show is history."
"KIRK: But we're only missing twelve!"
"TAYLOR: We have to find every last egg."
"KIRK: Well, then, Joe and I --"
"TAYLOR: Joe just left for Cabala class. I have no men left."
"KIRK: You have me left."
"TAYLOR: I have no men left. [disgusted] I've lost my appetite."
"[Taylor takes his money and leaves. Kirk looks forlorn.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE PATIO"
"[Lorelai and Rory enter from the house.]"
"LORELAI: Hi, guys. Wow, love the heaters."
"EMILY: It's not too cold, is it? We thought we'd start the evening out here."
"RORY: It's nice. [They wander to sit near Jason.]"
"RICHARD: No, no. I'm not seeing the olives that Floyd likes."
"EMILY: They're in the back on the right. Is this cart in the best place?"
"RICHARD: Move it back?"
"EMILY: Move it back."
"JASON: [murmuring] They keep moving everything back and forth -- the cart, the heater, me. I used to be over there."
"LORELAI: They're perfectionists."
"JASON: It's like watching an ant farm."
"RICHARD: Oh! I should go grab that gin that Floyd likes. I've got some in the freezer."
"EMILY: Maybe it was better in the other spot."
"LORELAI: Patio looks great, Mom, really."
"EMILY: I guess. Where's that awful light coming from?"
"RORY: I think it's the moon?"
"LORELAI: You're not thinking of having the moon moved, are you, Mom?"
"EMILY: I suppose it will move on its own at some point. [looks at Lorelai] You look nice."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"EMILY: Why do you look so nice?"
"LORELAI: Because I knew this was an important night for you guys, I thought I would dress up a little."
"[The doorbell rings.]"
"EMILY: They're here. Richard, they're here! [walks off]"
"RORY: You do look especially nice tonight."
"LORELAI: What is with everyone? It's not like I'm always in dirty sweats fresh from slopping the pigs."
"RORY: You know what I mean. You don't have that just-came-from-work look about you."
"LORELAI: A girl can't dress up a little?"
"JASON: Your mom's a little nervous."
"LORELAI: [shushes Jason] Ta-ta-ta-da."
"RORY: Oh, right. You're meeting the parents. I actually had not put that together before. That's why you showered."
"LORELAI: That's not why I showered."
"[Richard, Emily, Floyd and Carol walk out onto the patio.]"
"RICHARD: Here we are!"
"CAROL: Oh, your patio is beautiful, Emily!"
"EMILY: Thank you, Carol."
"CAROL: [to Jason] Hi, honey. [They hug.]"
"JASON: Hi, Mom."
"RICHARD: Floyd, Carol, our daughter, Lorelai,"
"FLOYD: How do you do."
"RICHARD: And our granddaughter, Rory."
"FLOYD: Hello."
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: We've met before, but a long time ago. Hi."
"FLOYD: We remember you well."
"CAROL: You didn't dress up for our benefit, I hope."
"LORELAI: No, no. This is nothing weird."
"RICHARD: How 'bout some beverages, everybody? Extra dry martini still your drink, Floyd?"
"FLOYD: Absolutely."
"LORELAI: Same here, Dad."
"RICHARD: And bourbon with a splash of branch water, right, Carol?"
"CAROL: Thank you, Richard. [looks around the patio] Oh, here, Emily. You've redone the patio. It's gorgeous!"
"EMILY: Don't you think?"
"CAROL: Oh, and those trees -- I love them. What are they?"
"EMILY: They're African. Come see."
"[They walk off together. Jason, Lorelai and Floyd sit down with Rory.]"
"FLOYD: I'm trying to remember when we saw you last."
"LORELAI: Ah, probably at camp."
"FLOYD: Right, the day we came to pick up Jason. There was a talent show. You sang a duet with a pimply fellow."
"LORELAI: ""Crater Face"" Cutler."
"JASON: He's a litigator now. Very bitter man."
"FLOYD: Well, the pimply fellow t*nk, but you were wonderful -- very charming."
"LORELAI: It was from ""Grease."""
"JASON: How Crater Face got his pimples?"
"LORELAI: No, my song -- ""Summer Lovin'."" I had to sit on his lap. It was very uncomfortable."
"JASON: Crater Face had very bony knees."
"FLOYD: [to Jason] And you did a dance with somebody, if I remember correctly."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, he cha-cha'd."
"JASON: Well, thank you for bringing that up."
"RORY: [to Lorelai] And thank you for never sending me to camp."
"LORELAI: You were great. I liked when you and your partner knocked heads."
"JASON: ""Clubfoot"" Cindy -- she married ""Crater Face"" Cutler. Beautiful children."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"RICHARD: Here are your drinks everybody. [approaches with drinks on tray, humming ] Uh, Rory, we left your soda inside."
"RORY: Oh, I'll go get it."
"FLOYD: I actually had a barbershop quartet at Yale. I was by far the weakest link. That reminds me. I have a story I've been dying to tell you ever since I heard it, Richard, about Herb Benson."
"RICHARD: Oh, what's the rogue up to now?"
"FLOYD: Later. I don't want to bore the others."
"RICHARD: I can't wait. Help me take the drinks down to the ladies?"
"FLOYD: Absolutely. Excuse us."
"[Lorelai sighs.]"
"RICHARD: [in the distance] Alright, ladies?"
"JASON: [ Sighs ] Wow, look at that."
"LORELAI: Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo together again."
"RORY: [enters] Excuse me, Grandma."
"EMILY: Yes, sweetie?"
"RORY: Elsa said to say that dinner's in fifteen minutes."
"EMILY: Did she ask you to do some vacuuming, too?"
"RORY: Um...no."
"EMILY: She sends my granddaughter out to do her job."
"FLOYD: How many maids has Emily been through, Richard? We used to keep a running count."
"RICHARD: No, I'm afraid western mathematical principles cannot accommodate such a task."
"JASON: My father is in a particularly good mood tonight."
"LORELAI: Very."
"JASON: He's only said two passive-aggressive things to me since he got here, which is astounding for him. By the way, may I be the fourteenth person this evening to say how great you look?"
"LORELAI: It's the shower. I gotta try that more often."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE DINING ROOM"
"[Carol and Floyd share grandchildren photos with Emily and Richard]"
"CAROL: Oh, this is our grandson's first step. We were so lucky to have the camera ready."
"EMILY: Oh, that's darling."
"RICHARD: Oh, ho, ho. He's gonna be big."
"FLOYD: He's gonna start on the defensive line for the Bulldogs in 2021."
"CAROL: [giggling] Floyd has it all worked out."
"LORELAI: I believe that's you very lovingly holding your nephew, who looks very happy in your arms."
"JASON: I just told him I'd opened a no-load mutual fund for him. Tracks the S&P."
"LORELAI: You sentimental fool."
"EMILY: You know, I have some terrific pictures of Rory. I should go get them."
"RORY: But, Grandma, I'm right here."
"EMILY: I know, but you're so big now."
"LORELAI: Slouch down in your chair for Grandma, honey."
"RORY: You know, if it's okay, I actually thought I might leave soon."
"LORELAI: She's got a big paper due next week and lots of reading."
"EMILY: Oh, yes, Rory. We've made you stay too long already."
"RICHARD: Oh, yes, go, go."
"CAROL: Thank you for looking like you weren't too bored all evening."
"RORY: Oh, no, I wasn't, really. It was fun. Bye, Grandma. [kisses Emily's cheek]"
"RMILY: [to Lorelai] You have to go, too?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, we came separately."
"EMILY: Good."
"RORY: Bye, Grandpa. [gives Richard a kiss]"
"RICHARD: Goodbye, Rory."
"FLOYD: Lovely girl."
"EMILY: Oh, she's a doll."
"RICHARD: Well, I think this is the perfect time for those who are so inclined to enjoy a cigar. [rises from table]"
"LORELAI: All right, let's fire 'em up!"
"RICHARD: I meant the men, but would you like a cigar?"
"LORELAI: No, you guys go. Circle the fire. Pound your chests. We'll be waiting."
"RICHARD: Floyd, Jason. [exits]"
"JASON: Let's do it."
"EMILY: Well, let's let Elsa clean up and maybe keep her job. The living room all right?"
"LORELAI: We can bring the coffee?"
"EMILY: I was going to pour brandy."
"LORELAI: Even better."
"CAROL: Ooh, let's go. Oh, this evening has been so wonderful, Emily -- the two of us together again."
"EMILY: Yes, it has."
"CAROL: All those horrible things that happed with the business -- now, let's not let business come between us again."
"EMILY: All that ugliness is in the past now, so we don't have to worry."
"CAROL: Yes."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE DEN"
"[The men are puffing on cigars.]"
"FLOYD: Smooth. '63?"
"RICHARD: '65. You can't get a '63 to save your life."
"JASON: Still does the trick, though."
"RICHARD: Oh, good port was as caught up in that ridiculous cigar boom a few years ago, remember?"
"FLOYD: Yes, yes."
"RICHARD: Amateurs -- babes in diapers talking big in those cigar clubs, smoking Churchills down to the ring. Tobacco farmers harvested their crop green just to keep up with the demand."
"FLOYD: If I remember correctly, you found a way to rectify the problem."
"RICHARD: I couldn't get Hennessy's to put my favorite cigars aside for me -- this after twenty years of giving them my business."
"FLOYD: Big mistake."
"JASON: Love these kind of stories."
"RICHARD: So I bypassed the bastards. I found their supplier. I swooped in and bought all of my favorites in bulk -- hundreds of boxes, cash on the barrel, so now Hennessy's couldn't get them."
"JASON: Hundreds of boxes?"
"RICHARD: Oh, I couldn't have smoked them in three lifetimes, so I kindly offered to sell Hennessy's my excess supply. They leapt at it like dogs for a bone. And I made enough to pay for the boxes that I kept."
"JASON: You're creative, Richard. It's one of your many strengths."
"FLOYD: I'd say it's his main strength."
"RICHARD: Who ever said an insurance man can't be creative?"
"FLOYD: It's one of the fallacies about what we do. People think it's dry, wooden, a bunch of automatons shuffling papers. On the contrary -- it breeds daily. It's life and death, what we do. [Richard nods.] It's a new drama every day -- almost Shakespearean."
"RICHARD: ""Richard III,"" ""Macbeth."""
"FLOYD: What day doesn't necessitate courage, tenacity, and sometimes, like your cigar story, Richard, a little vengeance?"
"RICHARD: And that's all before lunch."
"FLOYD: Our work is wonderful. I've always felt that way -- protective of what I do, protective of what I have."
"JASON: I think my cigar is out."
"FLOYD: That's why I'm suing you."
"JASON: Dad."
"RICHARD: You're joking."
"FLOYD: I'm not joking. I'm suing your company. My lawyers will be contacting you Monday morning."
"RICHARD: Floyd, you're not serious."
"FLOYD: Richard, you didn't think I'd let Digger walk away with some of my oldest clients and not respond, did you? Are you that naive?"
"JASON: Dad, this is crazy."
"FLOYD: You signed a noncompete clause with me, Digger."
"JASON: And I didn't break that clause."
"RICHARD: He didn't, Floyd. I studied Jason's contract, and only certain clients were off limits, and those remained off limits."
"FLOYD: Alexander Barnes was off limits."
"JASON: That was a social lunch, and you can't prove otherwise. You have no case."
"FLOYD: Maybe, maybe not. But by the time the courts figure out the situation, I'll have buried you in legal fees. I know your financial situation, Richard. You can't survive a lengthy legal process."
"RICHARD: So, this is just revenge, Floyd? Are we stooping that low?"
"FLOYD: You just described how strongly you felt about a bunch of cigars. How did you think I was going to feel about my business?"
"JASON: How did you know I had lunch with Alex, Dad? You have a private investigator tailing me?"
"FLOYD: This whole business is so distasteful, but what was I to do? I did what I had to do -- what Richard Gilmore would do. I think I should go now."
"JASON: Don't -- Dad, don't leave. Call this off!"
"FLOYD: Sorry I didn't get to that anecdote, Richard. Maybe some other time. [exits]"
"JASON: Dad! [follows]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE SITTING ROOM"
"EMILY: Rory did come out and she was a beautiful debutante -- the hit of the night."
"LORELAI: She did so well, we had her go back in and come out again."
"[loud voices approach]"
"RICHARD: Floyd, wait."
"JASON: Dad, I will block the door if I have to."
"FLOYD: I wouldn't suggest you do that, son."
"EMILY: What is going on?"
"CAROL: I should get my purse. [She sets her drink down and rises.]"
"EMILY: Carol, no."
"FLOYD: Excuse us, Emily. This is rude, but we have to go."
"JASON: Mom, stay."
"CAROL: It's too late, Jason."
"EMILY: What's going on? Richard?"
"FLOYD: I apologize, for how this ended."
"RICHARD: We are not unprepared for a fight. We are capitalized."
"FLOYD: Only because you put your pension up as collateral on all your loans, Richard."
"RICHARD: How did you -"
"FLOYD: It's a small community, our community. Endangering your pension, Richard -- it's reckless."
"JASON: Which PI did you have on me? Paluso, I assume?"
"FLOYD: He's the best. He gets everything. It's how I found out your daughter is dating my son."
"EMILY: That's not true."
"[Richard looks at Lorelai]"
"FLOYD: Sorry we spoiled your secret, son. We'll see ourselves out. Come on, Carol."
"JASON: Dad, wait! Richard, Emily, this isn't gonna happen, period. It will resolve quickly and in our favor. Excuse me. Dad! [dashes off] Okay, now, forgetting the insufferable way that you presented this subject --[becoming more faint]"
"[There is a long uncomfortable silence until Jason returns.]"
"RICHARD: We need to talk. [He exits with Jason following.]"
"EMILY: You brought your own car, didn't you?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: You don't need to stay. You can go."
"LORELAI: I'm blocked in."
"EMILY: Oh."
"[Another long silence. Emily eventually walks off leaving Lorelai alone.]"
"CUT TO DEN"
"JASON: Richard, you have every right to be angry."
"RICHARD: Oh, you're damn right I do. To be humiliated like this in my own house?!"
"JASON: It was unconscionable."
"RICHARD: Why didn't you see this coming?"
"JASON: You know him, Richard. He doesn't show his hand. He sweet-talked us on the golf course, got himself invited to dinner. The man is a sociopath!"
"RICHARD: Tell me if you've done anything -- anything illegal."
"JASON: Nothing, Richard, I swear to you -- nothing."
"RICHARD: The lunch with Alex?"
"JASON: Social -- we're friends."
"RICHARD: Why should I believe you?"
"JASON: Because I'm not stupid enough to do anything illegal or think that I could get anything illegal by you. I do push boundaries, Richard, but I never cross them -- ever."
"RICHARD: How long have you been seeing my daughter?"
"JASON: Five months."
"RICHARD: For five months you've been lying to me."
"JASON: Yes, but it was a white lie. [Richard gasps] It was a timing issue. It would have complicated our relationship, yours and mine, and we didn't know if it would last, so we took a path. It was the wrong path, and I am sorry about that, too."
"RICHARD: You've got a lot to be sorry about."
"JASON: I do. My damned father. I should have seen this coming. As well as I know him, I keep underestimating him."
"RICHARD: [ Sighs ] We both should have seen this coming."
"JASON: I can make this go away."
"RICHARD: How?"
"JASON: It's a bluff. You know my father. He hates giving money to lawyers, and this action is gonna cost him big."
"RICHARD: That is true."
"JASON: So we will counter sue. It's a wrongful lawsuit. We will make him pay."
"RICHARD: Possibly."
"JASON: And I will do anything to win back your trust, Richard. You have been so good to me. Please...let me try."
"RICHARD: Okay. You've got my trust. Go get him."
"JASON: Thank you, Richard. Thank you. And also, I'm gonna work on my golf game -- get it up to snuff so I stop embarrassing you around the greens."
"RICHARD: [ Chuckling ] Yeah, do that."
"JASON: Thank you, Richard."
"[Door closes as Jason exits]"
"CUT TO EXTERIOR OF ELDER GILMORE HOUSE"
"[Lorelai attempts to escape tight parking in her Jeep]"
"LORELAI: [sighs as she move forward an inch] God. [sighs as she moves back an inch]"
"JASON: [approaches and talks through car window] I have a gigantic bottle of vodka at my place -- the largest bottle of vodka known to man."
"LORELAI: But what will you drink?"
"JASON: Gin."
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT"
"[Delirious, Kirk staggers though the square. He's still searching for eggs, still empty-handed.]"
"KIRK: Eggs. Gotta get the eggs. [He almost runs into a couple.]"
"GIRL: Whoa."
"GUY: Whoa, buddy."
"KIRK: Eggs. [He turns and frightens an old woman on the sidewalk.] Aaah!"
"WOMAN: Aaah! [She runs away.]"
"KIRK: Aaah! [He stumbles further and collapses to ground. He looks up and sees Luke standing before him.] Flower show's tomorrow. Flower show's tomorrow, and I can't find the last twelve eggs. [crying] I let Taylor down. He's like a father to me. I think he is my father."
"LUKE: He's not your father."
"KIRK: No, my father's my father, which means Taylor's my tailor. I wonder how much he charges to hem pants."
"LUKE: He's not your tailor."
"KIRK: I let him down! I let Taylor down. I let the whole town down. He won't like me anymore."
"[Luke drops a plastic bag full of eggs on the ground before Kirk.]"
"KIRK: What's this?"
"LUKE: It's the last twelve eggs."
"KIRK: The last --"
"LUKE: you picked some screwy places to hide them. Don't do that again."
"KIRK: The last twelve?"
"LUKE: Tell Taylor you found them. Be the hero. [walks away]"
"KIRK: [climbs to feet] Thank you. Thank you! [shouting] I love you, Luke Danes! I love you!"
"LUKE: [muttering to himself] I'm stupid."
"KIRK: [yelling loudly] I love you! I love Luke Danes! Love, love!"
"CUT TO INTERIOR OF RORY'S CAR - SAME NIGHT"
"[Rory is driving down Stars Hollow's main street. She slows to a stop when she sees Dean run out of an alley toward her car.]"
"DEAN: Hey. Come on."
"RORY: What? Where?"
"DEAN: I want to talk to you. Come on. [Rory follows Dean into an alley.] I've been trying to call your cell."
"RORY: I didn't have it on."
"DEAN: I'm sorry, okay? I'm really sorry."
"RORY: About what?"
"DEAN: I was a jerk at your dorm. I yelled."
"RORY: You didn't yell."
"DEAN: I got upset, and I shouldn't have."
"RORY: No, Dean, I'm the jerk. Hounding you about school like that -- it all came out wrong. It's your life. It's your decision."
"DEAN: No, I shouldn't have sniped like that."
"RORY: I deserved it."
"DEAN: You were concerned."
"RORY: I want the best for you, and I think school is it. I still think that, but it's not up to me. I just don't want you to settle."
"DEAN: Yeah, I know you don't. Sometimes it seems like you're the only one who doesn't. [ Sighs ]"
"RORY: I think Lindsay may have overheard me saying stuff at Doose's."
"DEAN: Yeah."
"RORY: I feel even worse about that. I've got such a big mouth."
"DEAN: No, it's okay."
"RORY: She must have been really upset."
"DEAN: Kind of."
"RORY: I didn't mean to hurt her feelings."
"DEAN: She'll be okay."
"RORY: She knows we talk, right -- that we're friends?"
"DEAN: She does now. She doesn't want me talking to you anymore."
"RORY: Oh. Well, I guess that's understandable."
"DEAN: I don't want that to happen."
"RORY: I don't want that to happen either."
"DEAN: Then it's not gonna happen."
"RORY: Should you get home?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"RORY: Me too."
"[Rory watches as Dean walks away.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOUSE BACK PATIO - SAME NIGHT"
"[Richard stands by the fence with drink in hand. Emily joins him.]"
"EMILY: Is it true? Did you put your pension up as collateral? Are we in trouble?"
"RICHARD: It's going to work out, Emily. It'll be okay."
"EMILY: You and Jason talked?"
"RICHARD: It's going to be okay."
"CUT TO JASON'S TOWNHOUSE - SAME NIGHT"
"[On sofa, a tipsy Lorelai uses hand signals to a tipsy Jason.]"
"JASON: Uh, three words. Four words. Two words. Okay, you suck at charades."
"LORELAI: We're playing charades?"
"JASON: Yeah, weren't we?"
"LORELAI: You're drunk."
"JASON: You're drunk."
"LORELAI: Don't drunk and drive."
"JASON: I would not thunk it."
"LORELAI: That's a fun game to play."
"JASON: What?"
"LORELAI: The ""changing words into funny words"" game."
"JASON: [ Sighs ] Oh, I'm sleepy."
"LORELAI: Hey, you know, your father was terrific until the end."
"JASON: Yeah, the end was kind of bad."
"LORELAI: It's like falling 600 feet to your death. You know, it's fun the first 599 feet, but it's just the last foot -- total sucko."
"JASON: Yeah, it's a bummer -- that last foot. But, you know, there is a bright side to this evening."
"LORELAI: The moon?"
"JASON: No, but the moon was very bright. At least our relationship is out in the open -- no more hiding."
"LORELAI: Yeah, no more hiding. I'll drink to that."
"JASON: And I got Richard calm, and I'll work my magic, which is what I do."
"LORELAI: Dad's head looked like it was gonna go full-out piñata."
"JASON: It'll be okay. He and I are going golfing in a couple days. That always puts him a good mood."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Your plant is dead. How did it die so quickly?"
"JASON: It may have been self-inflicted."
"LORELAI: Poor thing. Are you okay, though? Am I being enough supportive? Reversed those last two words."
"JASON: No, I'm fine. In a weird way, my father trying to destroy me is the first time I've ever gotten any real respect out of him."
"LORELAI: Hmm. Cool. Clink. [glasses clink]"
"CUT TO SAME EXCLUSIVE GOLF COURSE ON FAIRWAY"
"[Richard completes his drive with a big swing.]"
"FLOYD: Nice sh*t! Beautiful!"
"RICHARD: Your charity is limitless"
"FLOYD: You're just warming up. You've always been a closer."
"RICHARD: Too true. So, we're done with the broad strokes?"
"FLOYD: I believe so. I'll drop the lawsuit. We'll split the clients evenly. You'll come back to the firm -- have your own company under our umbrella."
"RICHARD: And Jason is out."
"FLOYD: Jason's out. You'll be returning a hero, Richard."
"RICHARD: Hmm. Music to my ears."
"FLOYD: Beautiful day today."
"RICHARD: Beautiful."

"OPEN ON SIDEWALK OF STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai briskly walks down the street as Luke, also walking quickly, joins her.]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Oh, I left a tip this time. And I didn't put it under the water glass, 'cause I know you hate that, and I made sure it didn't touch the syrup, 'cause that makes it sticky, and I didn't leave the last dollar in pennies just to get rid of them."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: So, why are you running down the street yelling at me?"
"LUKE: I wasn't running. I was walking. I wasn't yelling. I was talking."
"LORELAI: Oh, what did you say?"
"LUKE: ""Hey."""
"LORELAI: Oh, hey."
"LUKE: You are a lot of work."
"LORELAI: No, you're a lot of work."
"LUKE: You heading in there? [He indicates a store entrance.]"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I need stamps. You heading in there?"
"LUKE: Yep. I'm getting my divorce. [He reaches for the door.]"
"LORELAI: What? [She stops in her tracks, shocked.]"
"LUKE: Yeah. [He returns to stand before her.]"
"LORELAI: You're g-getting a mail-order divorce?"
"LUKE: These are the papers we had drawn up before. I just have to sign them."
"LORELAI: And you're signing them in there?"
"LUKE: There's a notary in there."
"LORELAI: Luke, that is a Mail Boxes Etc."
"LUKE: So?"
"LORELAI: So, you buy envelopes at a Mail Boxes Etc. You don't get divorced at a Mail Boxes Etc."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because, I don't -- it's not dignified."
"LUKE: Well, crapping out in a marriage isn't that dignified, either, but I did that."
"LORELAI: Luke..."
"LUKE: Look, I just want to get this over with. It's not a big deal. I just need to sign a piece of paper."
"LORELAI: You're ending a marriage."
"LUKE: I'm signing a paper --"
"LORELAI: -- that says you're ending a marriage."
"LUKE: Please let me do this."
"LORELAI: Why don't you go to a lawyer's office?"
"LUKE: I hate lawyers."
"LORELAI: How about a friend's house?"
"LUKE: Dougie and Scooter are off at camp."
"LORELAI: This is wrong."
"LUKE: This is fine. This is practical."
"LORELAI: Getting a divorce should not be practical."
"LUKE: I only have 20 minutes until I have to be back at work."
"LORELAI: A divorce should not be rushed."
"LUKE: For someone who's never actually been through a divorce, you sure know a lot about it."
"LORELAI: You should take a few minutes to think."
"LUKE: I have thought. It's over. I know it's over. And all I have to do is go in there and sign this paper in front of a notary, and then it's officially over. I'm fine. Please, I'm begging you -- let me get divorced."
"LORELAI: All right, then. Go ahead. [She solemnly looks down at the sidewalk.]"
"LUKE: Thank you. [He starts to move to the door then pauses, again returning to Lorelai who isn't following.] I thought you needed stamps."
"LORELAI: I can get them later."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I just thought I'd give you some privacy."
"LUKE: I'm not taking a shower -- I'm signing a paper."
"LORELAI: I can come back later."
"LUKE: Will you please get in there and buy your stamps?"
"LORELAI: Okay, fine."
"LUKE: [He follows her inside.] Lots and lots of work..."
"CUT TO INSIDE MAIL BOXES ETC STORE"
"KIRK: [He pops up from behind the counter.] Welcome to Mail Boxes Etc. How may I help you?"
"LORELAI: You go ahead."
"LUKE: I need to get something notarized."
"KIRK: Terrific. We are happy to help you with all of your mailing and notarizing needs. I will need you to fill out your name and address, and then I will need a thumbprint."
"LUKE: I know how it works, Kirk."
"KIRK: You have a pen?"
"LUKE: I have a pen."
"KIRK: [to Lorelai] What can I do for you today?"
"LORELAI: [gently] I can wait till he's done."
"LUKE: She needs stamps."
"LORELAI: I can wait till he's -"
"LUKE: Just get your stamps. [Lorelai tries to object.] Just get your stamps."
"LORELAI: But - but, I -"
"LUKE: Oh, my God, the work. [He shakes his head and continues to fill out the form.]"
"LORELAI: I need stamps."
"KIRK: Well, your timing is perfect. The breakfast-food series just came out last week. [shows sheet to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: [She gasps with delight.] Look at the dancing toast."
"KIRK: Aren't they a kick? And here is our cartoon series."
"LORELAI: Hey, do you have any Lucille Balls left?"
"KIRK: Yes, I have some Balls. [Luke looks up and reacts unnoticed.] I'm sorry. Are you a fan of the '50s-slash-mid-'60s sitcom heroines?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. [eager anticipation] Am I?"
"KIRK: I think you are."
"LORELAI: [gasps] ""Bewitched?"" I love ""Bewitched."""
"KIRK: Me too. Dr. b*mb was a big influence on me."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God -- Serena? I wanted to be Serena. With that hair..."
"KIRK: And the miniskirts..."
"LORELAI: And the groovy, psychedelic music..."
"KIRK: Did you practice the twitch?"
"LORELAI: Oh, who didn't practice the twitch? [giggles]"
"[Luke tries to concentrate and begins to look impatient]"
"KIRK: Tabitha was so lucky. And hey, what ever happened to her little brother Adam? I mean, they determined in episode 242 that he was a warlock, and then..."
"LUKE: I'm trying to get divorced here!"
"KIRK: Sorry."
"LORELAI: [gently] I'm sorry."
"[There's a long pause while Luke sighs and continues with the form.]"
"KIRK: [speaking quietly] Remember when Endora called him ""Derwood?"""
"LORELAI: Shh. [She gestures to Luke, who is shifting impatiently.]"
"KIRK: Sorry."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai enters, approaches and sits at the counter where Luke is prying at a toaster.]"
"LORELAI: Oh man. b*at up the toaster again?"
"LUKE: This damn thing stopped working."
"LORELAI: Could get another one."
"LUKE: This one will be fine."
"LORELAI: Sure -- as soon as it learns its place. You gonna go ten rounds with the coffee maker, or - [Luke is already pouring her a cup of coffee.] Ooh, thank you. What happened to your thumb?"
"LUKE: It's from the thumbprint yesterday."
"LORELAI: I thought they had inkless pads now."
"LUKE: They do, Kirk doesn't."
"LORELAI: Right."
"LUKE: [He resumes working on the toaster.] He hasn't even heard of them. He just uses the stuff that came in the notary kit he sent away for. I've been scrubbing my thumb for two days. I've tried soap, I've tried cleaning fluid -"
"LORELAI: Have you tried fire?"
"LUKE: Now not only am I divorced, every time I look at my black thumb, I'm reminded that I'm divorced."
"LORELAI: Sorry about your thumb."
"LUKE: It's okay. I have another one."
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what might make you feel better?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Handing me a cherry Danish."
"LUKE: Well, it's certainly worth a try. [A cell phone in Lorelai's purse rings.] Out."
"LORELAI: But I just got my coffee."
"LUKE: Follow the thumb."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S DINER ENTRANCE"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY'S VOICE: Who is this?"
"LORELAI: This is Lorelai Gilmore."
"[Cut between Rory's dorm room and Stars Hollow outside.]"
"RORY: No, this is Lorelai Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Ooh, ""Gaslight."""
"RORY: So, you have my phone."
"LORELAI: Yes, you left it in the kitchen. You know what that means, don't you? You miss Mommy."
"RORY: Yes, or that the refrigerator was empty, and I ordered food."
"LORELAI: Oh, that makes much more sense."
"RORY: Just hold onto it for me? I'll get it from you next time I see you."
"LORELAI: Okay -- ooh, hold on, hon. [A second cell phone rings and now she has a cell phone held to each ear.] Hello?"
"JASON: So, I'm officially taking the one hour I have off to go to the driving range to hit golf balls to try to improve my sucky game, thereby redeeming myself in your father's eyes."
"LORELAI: I like the use of ""sucky"" and ""thereby"" in the same sentence."
"RORY: Hey, who's that?"
"LORELAI: It's Jason."
"RORY: Tell him hi."
"[Luke exits the diner and approaches holding Lorelai's Danish.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Rory says hi."
"JASON: Tell her hi back."
"LORELAI: He says hi back. [to Luke] Hi."
"LUKE: This is a sickness."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll be in in a minute."
"LUKE: Who are you talking to?"
"LORELAI: My other two personalities."
"LUKE: I'll bring this back inside. [He starts to leave.]"
"LORELAI: Wait, wait -- bite. [Luke holds the Danish out and she carefully takes a bite.]"
"LUKE: A frightening picture of things to come. [He goes back inside the diner.]"
"LORELAI: Did you talk to anyone yet?"
"JASON: I left a message for Dad. I talked to Mom, but she just had her morning Mr. Happy pill, so of course she was having a happy morning and was absolutely no help. But I'm on it."
"LORELAI'S VOICE: A man on a mission."
"JASON: That's me."
"RORY: Fire!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Nothing. I was just feeling left out."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry."
"JASON: I figure, if he doesn't call me back by 4:00, I'll just go over there. Okay, I'm at the club. I'm gonna hang up now."
"LORELAI: Call me later."
"RORY: Me?"
"LORELAI: No."
"JASON: No?"
"LORELAI: Not you."
"RORY: Not me?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm confused. [She has both phones to her ears.] Who's hanging up now?"
"JASON: Uh, that would be me."
"LORELAI: Good. Okay. I'll talk to you later. [to Rory] Jason's gone."
"RORY: Finally had enough of you."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. It took three hours of my hula-dancing, Small World doll impressions, but I broke him."
"RORY: So, how's World w*r III going?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you know, the first boys off the boat were mowed down, but the next platoon is moving in."
"RORY: Which means?"
"LORELAI: Jason's making the lawsuit go away."
"RORY: Have you talked to Grandma or Grandpa yet?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Have you tried to talk to Grandma or Grandpa yet?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: That's my little Kofi Annan."
"LORELAI: Jason will fix it."
"RORY: Jason's not their daughter."
"LORELAI: Then he might have better luck."
"RORY: Why didn't you just tell them that you guys were dating?"
"LORELAI: Oh, come on. You know why. We were going to tell them when the time was right. Of course, I had no idea we were dealing with the Carringtons. All we needed was a swimming pool and some ball gowns to really end the evening right."
"RORY: This is unbelievable. I leave you people alone for one hour and all hell breaks loose."
"LORELAI: Hey, let's talk about something happy. How did your paper turn out?"
"RORY: It sucked."
"LORELAI: Why did it suck?"
"RORY: I just couldn't find the right hook. It didn't feel focused enough. I don't know. Professor Fleming's class is so hard."
"LORELAI: Hon, I bet it was great."
"RORY: You have to say that 'cause you're my mother."
"LORELAI: Oh, no. I'm not. I've been looking for the right time to tell you."
"RORY: Okay, I have to go now."
"LORELAI: Yeah, me too. Danish calls."
"RORY: Talk to parents."
"LORELAI: I'm going to take advice from you after that paper you turned in?"
"RORY: Goodbye."
"LORELAI: Goodbye."
"CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT"
"[Zach and Brian are playing a video game while Gil sits patiently tuning his guitar.]"
"ZACH: Dude, come on... I want to do a heavenly prayer."
"BRIAN: Hold on, I'm trying to do a Vulcan sting, and I just let you do a half-moon death combo."
"ZACH: You didn't let me -- I used my soul charge."
"[Lane, holding a notebook, enters and sits.]"
"LANE: Guys, the band meeting started ten minutes ago."
"ZACH: We can hear and play at the same time, Lane."
"BRIAN: What?"
"ZACH: What?"
"LANE: Okay, fine. I'm going to decide the set list without you. Hey, Gil, I think now would be a great time to add a little Matchbox Twenty to our sound, don't you?"
"[Zach turns to stare at Lane - giving Brian the advantage of b*at Zach at the video game.]"
"TV: Necrid wins! [Zach stares at the TV in shock.]"
"ZACH: [with sarcasm] Thank you, Lane."
"LANE: You're welcome, Zach. Okay, let's do this. The gig is Friday night."
"GIL: Oh, hey, Lane. Who's taking care of the guest list? I need to put my wife down. We got a sitter that night, so we are free to party."
"BRIAN: How many people are we allowed to invite? 'Cause my aunt Susan left my uncle Sid, and she's staying with my parents, and that means she's going to bring my cousin, Turner."
"LANE: I'm sure that's fine."
"BRIAN: He goes everywhere dressed like Zorro."
"LANE: That still seems fine."
"BRIAN: And he's 16."
"ZACH: One less wedding you're gonna have to go to, my friend."
"BRIAN: You don't know that."
"ZACH: Here. [He hands Lane a folded paper napkin.]"
"LANE: What's this?"
"ZACH: It's the names of a couple chicks I met last night. Put them on the list."
"LANE: I'm sorry -- why am I suddenly in charge of the guest list?"
"BRIAN: 'Cause you're the most reliable."
"LANE: How very rock 'n' roll."
"ZACH: Hey, wait. [He looks at another napkin from his pocket.] Is one of those names Dixie?"
"LANE: Yes."
"ZACH: Wrong night. [He swaps napkins with Lane.]"
"GIL: I want you guys to see something. I've been working on the flier for the gig. [They gather around Gil.]"
"ZACH: Why is there a sandwich on it?"
"GIL: I used a flier from the sandwich shop to get the dimensions right. It's just a prototype. The real one won't have the sandwich on it."
"LANE: So, would there be a picture of us where the sandwich is?"
"ZACH: Or we could put the band name where the sandwich is."
"GIL: Just the name, I think. Diagonal. Across where the sandwich is."
"BRIAN: Everyone needs to stop saying ""sandwich."" I'm getting hungry."
"ZACH: Me too. Do we have anything to eat?"
"LANE: It was your turn to shop."
"ZACH: Then no."
"LANE: Great."
"BRIAN: What kind of sandwich is that?"
"GIL: That's the meatball expl*si*n."
"BRIAN: That sounds fantastic."
"ZACH: I would dress up like Zorro for a meatball expl*si*n."
"BRIAN: Why would those be connected?"
"ZACH: It would be like a dare."
"BRIAN: I once ate cheesecake off the floor on a dare."
"ZACH: Cheesecake..."
"GIL: Cheesecake would be good with the meatball expl*si*n."
"LANE: Okay, fine. [She puts down the notebook and tugs on her jacket.]"
"BRIAN: Where you going?"
"LANE: I'm going to go to the store, and I'm going to get us some food so maybe we can get back to work. Okay?"
"ZACH: Thanks, Mom."
"[Lane crosses the street and notices a young Korean girl exiting her mother's house in the distance. From behind a tall shrub, Lane watches Mrs. Kim follow the young girl, slip a scarf around her neck and hand her an apple. Lane also notices the young girl is wearing her old sweater. Lane looks shocked then sad.]"
"CUT TO GOLF DRIVING RANGE"
"[Jason is not doing well.]"
"JASON: [muttering to himself] Yeah, sure, that's exactly what I meant to do. [He sees a familiar face walking by.] Hey, Owen, good to see you. [They shake hands.]"
"OWEN: Ah, yes. Good to see you too, Jason. [He quickly turns to leave.]"
"JASON: You know, I was gonna call you about the changes in those contracts I sent over."
"OWEN: I'll call Richard about them tomorrow."
"JASON: Okay, or -"
"OWEN: Goodbye, Jason."
"[Puzzled, Jason watches Owen walk away.]"
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY IN LOBBY"
"[Michel leads a tour group around while talking about the inn.]"
"MICHEL: All of the woodwork was hand-carved by a union soldier that the owner, Mrs. Tinley, took pity on and nursed back to health. He got better, went off, slaughtered a few dozen Confederate soldiers, came back, and made the stairs. Nice story, yes? [The tour group follows Michel to the front lobby.] Yes, your American history is all over this inn. [He points through a window.] Oh, look, a deer. I think I know that little guy -- he was here for breakfast this morning. Creep up quietly. Take a better look. [He sighs as the group ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" around the window. Michel turns to Lorelai, who stands behind the front desk.] I have these people in the palm of my hand. Travel agents are so easy. Are the horses washed?"
"LORELAI: They're washed."
"MICHEL: Because I'm not bringing them out there to be disgusted by smelly horses."
"LORELAI: Trust me. They've been hosed down with new-car scent. They're great."
"MICHEL Okay, let's see -- they saw the deer, we released the doves, I've got the Stevens boy whitewashing the fence in short pants and a straw hat."
"LORELAI: No one can manufacture a quaint, small-town moment like you, Michel."
"MICHEL: [grins] Awww…"
"LORELAI: Ooh, travel agents coming back."
"MICHEL: [His grin evaporates.] Ugh... [His smile reappears as he turns to the group.] Adorable, yes? Okay, let me show you the upstairs, the bedrooms -- [sniffs the air] Oh, what is that delicious scent? Why, I bet our amazing chef, Sookie St. James, is experimenting with her cookie recipe again. Why don't we sneak into the kitchen and see if we can convince her to give us a taste? Okay? Follow me."
"MAN: Coming through! [Two men pass Michel carrying Sookie between them.]"
"SOOKIE: Coming through!"
"LORELAI: [gasps] Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: I'm okay."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"MICHEL: Did you make the cookies?"
"LORELAI: Is it your foot?"
"SOOKIE: I don't think I broke it. [She is grinning.] I didn't even hear a snap this time."
"LORELAI: Oh, Sookie..."
"MICHEL: What about the cookies?"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, the cookies are on the counter. Caramel-marshmallow-chocolate-chunk."
"LORELAI: Where are you taking her?"
"MAN: Dr. Su."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, great. He's the best."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Lorelai hovers while Sookie settles in the company van preparing to ride to the doctor's office.]"
"LORELAI: Call me the minute you get there."
"SOOKIE: Okay. God, I love having a kitchen again."
"LORELAI: You put the doctor on so I can talk to him?"
"SOOKIE: I will. Hey."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I'm back. [laughing]"
"[As the Inn's van pulls away, Lorelai sees Jason exiting his car and approaching.]"
"LORELAI: Well, this is a nice surprise."
"JASON: Well, apparently this is a day for surprises."
"LORELAI: Oh, what's the matter?"
"JASON: I spent the entire day trying to track down your father."
"LORELAI: Do you want to sit or plant or..."
"JASON: I left messages at his house, on his cell phone...finally, I went to the office, and he wasn't there."
"LORELAI: O-okay."
"JASON: The only people that were there were two extremely uncomfortable looking secretaries who practically threw their back out trying to avoid eye contact with me."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"JASON: Why? Yes. A good question. I asked myself the same thing. And then I got a call from Richard's lawyer."
"LORELAI: What did he want?"
"JASON: To tell me that Richard's going back into business with my father."
"LORELAI: What? Jason... no, my father wouldn't do that."
"JASON: He did it."
"LORELAI: No, that company forced him out."
"JASON: And now they have welcomed him back in. He has his own boutique company under their banner, a big office, no overhead."
"LORELAI: Well, there must be some --"
"JASON: and he is taking all our clients with him. I...couldn't believe it. I thought it was one of those crazy, not-so-funny, Billy-Crystal-At-The-Oscars kind of jokes, so I spent the last two hours calling every client I could, and they're all gone."
"LORELAI: Oh, Jason."
"JASON: The ones I brought in from my father's company, the ones I've brought in since -- all gone."
"LORELAI: How could he do this? How could my father just take the business from you?"
"JASON: Oh, no, no, no. He left me the business, but without the clients, the business consists of some stationery, a coffee maker, and some rubber pencil grips."
"LORELAI: I don't understand. Why would my father do that?"
"JASON: Because it's brilliant. It's perfect. He gets my dad to drop the lawsuit, he makes some extra cash, and he's sitting pretty. Makes perfect sense."
"LORELAI: But he was your partner."
"JASON: And now he's the guy running around town, bad-mouthing me. It is amazing. Your father has done a very thorough job. I've got nothing. He has ruined my reputation. What do I do now? I don't know. Move? Start over somewhere else? What? [He's pacing nervously.]"
"LORELAI: Well, you can't move."
"JASON: Well, I have to work, and he's making it pretty impossible for me to work here. Oh, my God. I'm gonna end up in Houston."
"LORELAI: Jason..."
"JASON: Where all the financial wash ups wash up. It's gonna be me and the Enron boys smoking cigars while their ankle cuffs beep in the background."
"LORELAI: What can I do?"
"JASON: Nothing. I just needed to vent. I'm okay. Thank you."
"LORELAI: Come in."
"JASON: No, no. I can't. I'll call you later. [He gives Lorelai a quick kiss. Lorelai looks helpless as he leaves.]"
"CUT TO YALE BOOK STORE"
"[A large crowd is gathered listening intently to Asher Fleming reading from a book.]"
"ASHER: ""I saw then what I had not seen before."" [Rory enters and stands close to where a smiling Paris - who is also riveted to Asher's recitation - is seated.] ""I saw the stoop of his shoulders, the lines on his face -- like a map of a country I had once traveled with him. I hoped these marks of age reflected wisdom, but I feared they were merely tokens, purchased with lack of sleep and the kind of artificial goodwill that's squeezed from a man in the public eye like oil from a rag.: [He closes the heavy book and crowd applauds. Sitting in front, a redhead wearing low-cut orange sweater smiles coyly at Professor Fleming.] Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind. [A tall slim brunette approaches and whispers in his ear. Paris' smile vanishes.]"
"BRUNETTE: [to the audience] Thank you, Asher Fleming, for that very moving excerpt from your new novel, ""Jaglon."" It is an absolutely electric book. Now, Professor Fleming has been kind enough to give us one hour, so if you'll just line up behind the table, you can get your book signed, and then take them over to the cash register to purchase them. [to Asher] If you'll just follow me."
"ASHER: My pleasure."
"[Rory joins Paris and sits down.]"
"PARIS: God, he was great. Wasn't he great?"
"RORY: He was very impressive."
"PARIS: He is so commanding. I mean, it's obviously not necessary for a brilliant novelist to also be an extraordinary public speaker, but he is."
"RORY: Yes, he is."
"PARIS: And he's sexy as hell."
"RORY: Teacher. Mine. Thanks."
"PARIS: Look at all these girls, just flocking around him. They're so obvious."
"[At the signing table, the redhead flirts with Asher.]"
"ASHER: Well, hello there."
"REDHEAD: Hello Professor Fleming. I can't tell you what a thrill this is."
"ASHER: Well, I'm -- I'm flattered."
"REDHEAD: You're a genius."
"ASHER: Am I? How delightful."
"REDHEAD: I'm buying a copy for everyone I know."
"ASHER: Well, then, you should meet some more people. You'll make my publisher's day. [The redhead giggles.]"
"PARIS: Who is she kidding? Like he can't see right through the multiple-book-buying ploy? I mean, what girl hasn't used that one?"
"RORY: God knows, I have."
"PARIS: You want to go up and say hi?"
"RORY: No, thanks. You go."
"PARIS: We won't be disturbing him. I'm his girlfriend."
"RORY: It's okay. Really."
"PARIS: Are you hiding from him because of your paper?"
"RORY: I'm not hiding. I just don't need to know how much it sucks before it's time."
"PARIS: You might be over-reacting."
"RORY: Oh. No. Smell that? What's that? Oh, yeah. I believe that's my paper. Thanks. I'll stay here."
"[They watch the progress of autograph signing. The redhead stands nearby.]"
"PARIS: Oh please -- she's going to hover. Pathetic. Hey, did I show you this? [She opens her own copy of his book.] Look."
"RORY: ""To a wise, willful, wonderful woman."""
"PARIS: That's me. He dedicated it to me."
"RORY: Wow, that's very nice."
"PARIS: I know."
"RORY: It's not very specific, but it's very nice."
"PARIS: Well, what's he supposed to do, write my name?"
"RORY: Perish the thought."
"PARIS: You know the situation."
"RORY: I do."
"PARIS: And as long as I know that the wise, willful, wonderful woman is me, who cares who else knows?"
"RORY: You're right. I'm sorry. I'm just stressed about my paper."
"PARIS: Well, don't take your loser paper out on me. Is he out of water? I'm going to get him some water."
"RORY: Paris, I'm sorry. The dedication's nice."
"PARIS: Thanks. [She leaves while watching more girls hovering around Asher.] Oh, yes. Like they read."
"[Rory walks toward the store exit as Doyle walks up.]"
"DOYLE: Well, this was a royal waste of my time. However, there were cookies. Here, hold some so I don't look like a pig."
"RORY: You didn't enjoy the reading?"
"DOYLE: I wasn't here to enjoy the reading. I was here to cover the reading for the paper to go along with the review of the book. And then I arrive only to realize that every single available girl at Yale is here, including four of my reporters."
"RORY: I'm not here on paper business. I'm here because I enjoy books and because I read books."
"DOYLE: Please."
"RORY: I do."
"DOYLE: And Paris?"
"RORY: She's with me."
"DOYLE: And Anna and Cassie?"
"RORY: Point, Doyle."
"DOYLE: Everybody's here because Fleming's an intellectual dreamboat."
"RORY: Well, I'm not here for the dreamboat."
"DOYLE: God, that man. He's got a constant rotation going. A new girl every year. Very young, of course. Last year it was Trey Myers. God, was she beautiful. She looked like what I always pictured a Swedish stewardess to be."
"RORY: Really?"
"DOYLE: Yep. Then they broke up at the end of the term, and she rebounded with a drama major."
"RORY: So, any idea who he's seeing now?"
"DOYLE: Actually, no. This year's girl is a bit of a mystery. Maybe he's already broken up with one, and he's trolling for another. [scoffs] My money's on the redhead. [They both observe the redhead still loitering near Asher.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE INTERIOR FRONT DOOR"
"[The doorbell rings. The maid opens the door for Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: Hi. I'm looking for my father. Big guy, bow tie."
"MAID: Mr. Gilmore's in the living room."
"LORELAI: Thank you. [She enters the sitting room where Richard is seated reading a book.] Well, you're here."
"RICHARD: Lorelai. I didn't know you were coming over."
"LORELAI: I called."
"RICHARD: Yes. Well, I haven't been in the mood to talk."
"LORELAI: Well, we need to. [She sets her purse down on the coffee table.]"
"RICHARD: I felt like reading."
"LORELAI: Why are you doing this, Dad?"
"RICHARD: Well, reading is good for you. You learn things."
"LORELAI: Jason was your partner."
"RICHARD: [inhales deeply] If we are going to discuss this, let's go into my office."
"LORELAI: Jason was your partner, and he said he was gonna take care of it."
"RICHARD: Lorelai..."
"LORELAI: Dad -- no, I'm fine talking right here. Jason said he was taking care of everything, and you didn't even give him a chance before you cut him out -"
"RICHARD: This is business."
"LORELAI: No, you took everything from him, Dad. You're ruining his reputation. You're making it impossible for him to work."
"RICHARD: I did what I had to do."
"LORELAI: You didn't have to do this."
"RICHARD: Well, thank you for your opinion."
"LORELAI: That company was so horrible to you. They treated you like dirt, they forced you out, and you chose them over him?"
"RICHARD: I am not choosing anyone over -"
"LORELAI: I just don't understand why you would do this. Is it because of me? Are you taking this out on him because --"
"RICHARD: [raising his voice] Did you not hear what the man said? Did you not hear Floyd threaten to go after everything your mother and I have?"
"LORELAI: Yes -"
"RICHARD: Everything I've worked for. This house, our livelihood."
"LORELAI: There has to be something else you can do. [Emily appears unnoticed at the top of the stairs.]"
"RICHARD: Go home, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: No, Dad, please... I'm -- I'm sorry that I lied to you about dating Jason, but you can't destroy him like this. [Emily moves closer to listen, still unnoticed.]"
"RICHARD: I'm hardly destroying him."
"LORELAI: You took his entire business. You've left him with nothing. He's talking about moving. Leaving."
"RICHARD: So what?"
"LORELAI: [incredulous] So? I'm in a relationship with him."
"RICHARD: Then go with him."
"LORELAI: You know I can't go with him. I have a business, I have a house, I have Rory. I can't just pick up and leave."
"RICHARD: Well, then, you've made your choice."
"LORELAI: Dad, stop it."
"RICHARD: I am tired of this, Lorelai. You've shown absolutely no concern about what happens to me, what happens to your mother. The only thing you care about is what happens to your boyfriend. And the worst part of it... is that I never expected you to act any differently. [Richard walks off. Lorelai, looking crushed, picks up her purse to leave.]"
"CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY"
"[Emily enters and approaches Richard, who is seated at his desk.]"
"EMILY: Is it really necessary?"
"RICHARD: Is what really necessary?"
"EMILY: Going after Jason like this."
"RICHARD: I didn't know you were a fan of Jason's."
"EMILY: I'm not. I'm just concerned."
"RICHARD: What are you concerned about, Emily?"
"EMILY: It took us a long time to get Lorelai back into this house, and she is dating Jason."
"RICHARD: What are you saying?"
"EMILY: I worry that if you do this, you'll drive Lorelai away again. And if she goes, Rory might go."
"RICHARD: She lied to us. To you. To me."
"EMILY: I am very well aware of what she did."
"RICHARD: The last time I checked, you didn't care for being lied to."
"EMILY: Don't be condescending. I don't like being lied to."
"RICHARD: [pointedly] We can't control what Lorelai will do. Rory won't go away. I'm doing what I have to do. [He returns to his reading, ending their conversation. Emily stands for a moment silently thinking, then leaves without a word.]"
"CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT"
"[Lane is talking on the phone to Rory. The scenes cut from Rory walking on Yale campus to Lane's apartment.]"
"LANE: Who does she think she is? Just walking out of my house like she owned the place."
"RORY: Your mom didn't just go out and get another kid."
"LANE: Korea is where you go to get new kids. Ask anyone."
"RORY: There has to be another explanation."
"LANE: The explanation is -- I've been replaced."
"RORY: You have not been replaced."
"LANE: She was wearing my bunny sweater."
"RORY: You hated that bunny sweater. That's why you left it there."
"LANE: She also had my second-least-favorite scarf, and she was eating my apple."
"RORY: What apple?"
"LANE: The apple my mother would have given me if I still lived there."
"RORY: Which you don't by your own choice, might I add."
"LANE: Now you're taking her side."
"RORY: I'm not taking her side."
"LANE: I've been replaced. Drop by when you're in town, meet your new best friend."
"RORY: Lane..."
"LANE: Tip her well when she waits on you at Luke's. Head over to the church with her, share a pew."
"RORY: Lane..."
"LANE: My mom has found a new daughter. I bet this one can needlepoint."
"RORY: Look, I've got to go. Paris said I could use ten daytime minutes on her phone, and after that, her exorbitant prevailing rates apply, so I'll call you back when I get to my room."
"LANE: Oh, wait, are you coming to the gig on Friday?"
"RORY: Gig? Yes. What time do you go on?"
"LANE: Eight o'clock. Which means 8:30."
"RORY: sh**t. Friday night dinner."
"LANE: Oh, I forgot."
"RORY: I don't think I'll make it in time."
"LANE: That's okay."
"RORY: But I want to see your gig."
"LANE: We will have other gigs. Of course, by that time the other Lane will be drumming in the band."
"RORY: Well, as long as she's got a good b*at."
"LANE: Have you gone out for the pep squad yet?"
"RORY: I'll call you in a little while. Bye."
"LANE: Bye."

"CUT TO YALE HALLWAY"
"[Rory waits patiently while other students anxiously pull graded papers from a wall tray.]"
"RORY: Excuse me."
"STUDENT 1: Oh, right. [He moves aside.] A B-minus. Oh, thank god."
"RORY: Not bad. [She shuffles through the remaining papers.]"
"STUDENT 1: Are you kidding? A B-minus in Fleming's class is like... an ""A"" anywhere else in sane America. [Student 2 nods in agreement.] Let's celebrate. [They leave. Rory pulls her paper from stack and is startled to see ""A - Excellent"" written in red on the cover.]"
"CUT TO RORY'S DORM ROOM"
"[Rory is studying on the sofa while loud music plays loudly from above. She stands, grabs a nearby broom and bangs on the ceiling repeatedly. She also hears pounding on the front door and answers it. Lorelai enters.]"
"LORELAI: College is loud!"
"RORY: Yes, it's part of our training. It's right up there with the bad food, the sleep deprivation, and how to hold your own hair while throwing up."
"LORELAI: Awww. [She kisses Rory on the head as they walk to and sit down on the sofa.]"
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Inn stuff. I had to pick up hinges and doorknobs and faucets."
"RORY: Oh, my."
"LORELAI: And I figured, while I was in the 'hood, I'd drop this off. [She hands Rory her cell phone.]"
"RORY: Hey, thanks. [The music stops.]"
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"RORY: Hey, you didn't have to do that. You could have just given it to me at Friday night dinner."
"LORELAI [chuckles] I could have."
"RORY: Unless you're not going to Friday night dinner. [Lorelai sighs.] You're not going to Friday night dinner."
"LORELAI: Rory?"
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Things have gotten worse."
"RORY: How could they be worse? They were already at worse."
"LORELAI: Dad is going after Jason, and...it's complicated but it's really bad. And I went over there to try to talk to him about it, and he was horrible. He said awful things to me."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: Like things. It doesn't matter, but I -- I can't just go and sit there and make small talk and pretend that everything's okay."
"RORY: Mom..."
"LORELAI: Because it's not okay."
"RORY: You were mad, he was mad, you said some things..."
"LORELAI: No, Rory."
"RORY: No. Now, I don't doubt that it was bad. You and Grandpa can make each other crazy, but maybe once he calmed down, he was sorry."
"LORELAI: He is not sorry."
"RORY: You could be wrong. Maybe if we go over there and give him a chance to make it right, he would."
"LORELAI: Oh, boy, honey, you're living in fuzzy-puppy land."
"RORY: Mom, it's really important to me that you don't back out of Friday night dinners. They're the only time that the whole family gets together. Sometimes it's the only time that I get to see you, and I like having it there. It's really important to me."
"LORELAI: Rory, come on."
"RORY: I'm serious. Please, just give him a chance to make it up to you. Please. I'll be there. I'll be your buffer."
"LORELAI: [laughs] You will, huh?"
"RORY: Absolutely. They can focus on me, you can focus on me..."
"LORELAI: What about when he throws his glass of water in my face?"
"RORY: Then I will get very wet."
"LORELAI: I'm holding you to that."
"RORY: Yep. [The loud music from upstairs begins again. They both look up.]"
"LORELAI: Wow."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lane's bustling around behind the counter during a very busy customer rush.]"
"LANE: [calling into the kitchen] Caesar, I need a turkey burger, fries well-done, and I'm still waiting for that grilled cheese and tomato."
"CAESAR: Patience is a virtue."
"LANE: Light a candle, and tell it to the pope. I want my grilled cheese, pronto. [She grabs the coffee pot and prepares to make the rounds.]"
"KIRK: Excuse me, Lane?"
"LANE: Uh, yes, Kirk."
"KIRK: I'm a little confused."
"LANE: About what, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Well, I'm looking at this flier you gave me, and what exactly do you have to do to get the sandwich?"
"LANE: What?"
"KIRK: I mean, does everyone who shows up get a sandwich, or is it first come, first sandwich?"
"LANE: Oh, that's a mistake. The sandwich isn't supposed to be there."
"KIRK: What are you saying?"
"LANE: I'm saying that's just a flier for our band. We're playing Friday at 8:30."
"KIRK: So, there's no sandwiches."
"LANE: No."
"KIRK: Then, why would I go?"
"LANE: To hear some great music."
"KIRK: Oh. Can I bring my own sandwich?"
"LUKE: Hey, Lane? [Lane approaches the counter where Luke is leaning.] I know it's time for your break now, but is it okay if I let Caesar take his?"
"LANE: He owes me a grilled cheese."
"LUKE: I'll do it. He's gotta run to the bank or something. To be honest, I wasn't paying too much attention, 'cause he was bugging me."
"LANE: No problem. [Caesar appears and hands Lane the grilled cheese plate.]"
"LUKE: Thanks."
"[Lane looks out the diner window and sees the young Korean girl walking nearby.]"
"LANE: I'm taking my 10! [She plunks down the plate and rushes out the diner door.]"
"KIRK: [He looks at the abandoned plate on the nearby empty table.] That looks like it travels well."
"CUT TO STAR'S HOLLOW SIDEWALK"
"[Lane rushes up to the girl and taps her on the shoulder.]"
"LANE: Hey."
"KOREAN GIRL: [startled] Oh."
"LANE: Who are you?"
"KOREAN GIRL: [Korean accent] Hi."
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"KOREAN GIRL: Where?"
"LANE: Why are you living in my house?"
"KOREAN GIRL: Your house?"
"LANE: That house right there. It's mine."
"KOREAN GIRL: I'm staying there."
"LANE: Why? Are we related?"
"KOREAN GIRL: I hope not."
"LANE: How do you know Mrs. Kim?"
"KOREAN GIRL: I am exchange student from Seoul. I'm here for three months, and Mrs. Kim is my host."
"LANE: Exchange student, huh?"
"KOREAN GIRL: Yes. Who are you?"
"LANE: I'm Mrs. Kim's daughter. She did tell you she had a daughter, right?"
"KOREAN GIRL: Yes."
"LANE: Well, she does, and it's me. So, you can try whatever tricks you want. I will always be her daughter."
"KOREAN GIRL: Why are you so mad?"
"LANE: Because you stole my life."
"KOREAN GIRL: I did not steal your life."
"LANE: You're living in my room. You're wearing my clothes. And don't tell me you always looked like that. [The girl starts yelling in Korean.] I'm not very crazy! [The girl continues speaking excitedly in Korean.] How would you like it if I moved into your house?! [Still yelling in Korean, the girl turns to leave.] Why don't you just go back home?!"
"KOREAN GIRL: Mrs. Kim…[Yelling the remainder in Korean, she runs back to Mrs. Kim's house.]"
"LANE: [calls after her] You don't have to feel sorry for Mrs. Kim! Mrs. Kim is fine! And give me back my sweater, and my second-least-favorite scarf!"
"CUT TO YALE CLASSROOM"
"[Professor Fleming concludes class with instructions.]"
"ASHER: On Tuesday, we'll continue our look at ""Neglect of the Individual"" as a hallmark of modern government. Be prepared to discuss Kafka's ""The Trial."" Yes, if, uh, if all goes well, it'll get very ugly. Thank you, everyone. [The class chuckles as they all rise to leave. Rory walks past Asher's desk on her way out.] Oh, very nice job on your paper, Miss Gilmore."
"RORY: Oh, thank you. [She pauses.] You know, Professor Fleming, I was actually a little surprised by my grade."
"ASHER: Were you? Well, you deserved it. You did good work."
"RORY: To be honest, I don't feel like I did."
"ASHER: Ah, a perfectionist."
"RORY: No, I'm not a perfectionist. I just know when I do well and when I don't."
"ASHER: You know, this sounds as if you're questioning your grade."
"RORY: Well, maybe I am."
"ASHER: Well, this is a first. Today alone, I've heard complaints from, uh... two ""D""s, four ""C""s, and an ""F,"" but, uh, not from an ""A."" In fact, in 35 years of teaching, I've never heard from an ""A."""
"RORY: I just want to be sure that the grade I got is... what I deserve."
"ASHER: What exactly are you saying, Miss Gilmore?"
"RORY: Just that if the grade I got wasn't... legitimately earned, then I have no interest in it."
"ASHER: Oh, how very noble of you."
"RORY: I intend to earn all of my grades. I don't want any favors."
"ASHER: And why exactly would you think that I'd be inclined to grant you any favors?"
"RORY: I'm not saying that you are --"
"ASHER: You're not? Oh, then I must have misunderstood this conversation."
"RORY: I'm just saying that --"
"ASHER: Yes?"
"RORY: That I want to earn all of my grades."
"ASHER: Yes, you've already said that."
"RORY: No matter how many ""wise, willful, and wonderful women"" I know."
"ASHER: Have you quite finished?"
"RORY: I suppose I am. [She turns to leave.]"
"ASHER: Oh, before you go any further, Miss Gilmore, let me assure you that I do not give grades that are not earned. I gave you an ""A"" because your argument was well-structured, your writing was clear and concise, and you drew a connection from Marsilius of Padua to Machiavelli to the modern age of media that PhD candidates would envy. In fact, no one else's paper was that thoroughly researched. Except for the other person who also got an ""A."" You did what was demanded, and you did it well. And I would seriously caution you not to question my grading tactics again."
"RORY: Okay. Thanks for the ""A."" [She pauses at the door before leaving.] And the redhead has fat thighs. [Asher slams his briefcase closed looking a bit perturbed.]"
"CUT TO FRONT DRIVEWAY OF ELDER GILMORE HOUSE"
"[Rory is leading her mother toward the front door.]"
"RORY: Come on."
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, there's no hurry. We're early."
"RORY: Yes, but we're here, so we might as well go in and get it over with."
"LORELAI: Okay, just relax, why don't you? I would like to stop and smell the roses if you don't mind."
"RORY: Mom..."
"LORELAI: You're young. You don't understand these things. I'm old, I'm dying, I'm gonna smell a rose. Oh, I don't see a rose. I think there's one next door."
"RORY: You're being a tad ridiculous. Come on."
"LORELAI: [morosely] On a scale of one to a million, how awful do you think tonight's gonna be?"
"RORY: Well, how high a number did you think the walk up the driveway was?"
"LORELAI: Ugh. You know, I wonder which tact my dad's gonna pick tonight. I bet he goes with the silent treatment."
"RORY: Or maybe...he won't."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you're right. He might prefer the full-on, frontal as*ault. You know, just constant mental flogging right from ""dingdong"" through till ""drive safe."""
"RORY: Well, at least he said ""drive safe."""
"LORELAI: Oh, no. It wasn't him. It was the maid."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: Or maybe Dad will be fine, and Emily will be on the attack. Yeah, a little good cop/bad cop if you know what I mean. Keep me on my toes. I won't be expecting that."
"RORY: Except that you are. Ready? [She reaches for the doorbell.]"
"LORELAI: [She stops Rory.] Okay -- wait, just wait -- we can still leave."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Rory... right now is the point in the horror movie where the entire audience is yelling, ""Don't go in there."""
"RORY: I will be right beside you, okay?"
"LORELAI: Okay. But I'm telling you... if my dad gets ugly, I'm out of there."
"[Rory pulls her hand from Lorelai's grasp, pats her arm reassuringly and rings the bell. Moments later Richard opens the door.]"
"RICHARD: Lorelai. Rory. You're early. [He is surprised.]"
"RORY: Yeah, no traffic."
"RICHARD: No? Well, that's very -- uh, come in. [He appears distracted/]"
"CUT TO SITTING ROOM"
"[Lorelai and Rory follow Richard to the sitting room.]"
"RICHARD: Did you hit much traffic? [He is animatedly jovial.]"
"RORY: Um...no. No traffic at all."
"RICHARD: Well, good. Uh, nothing like an hour stuck in traffic to ruin your complete day."
"LORELAI: Heh."
"[The girls remove their coats and sit down on loveseat - unsure what to think of Richard's odd behavior.]"
"RICHARD: Should I take your coats?"
"LORELAI: That's okay. We can just put them here. [She settles her coat beside her.]"
"RICHARD: All right. Well, you're early, so I'm not quite organized yet, but, uh, shall we have some drinks?"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RICHARD: All right. [He bounces to the bar table.] There's no ice. Do we need ice?"
"LORELAI: Uh. [shrugs]"
"RICHARD: [laughs] Of course we need ice. There's some in the kitchen. I'll go get it."
"RORY: Okay. [Richard exits.] He doesn't seem mad."
"LORELAI: All depends on which definition of ""mad"" you're going with."
"[Emily enters and rushes past them, toward the stairs with her coat and purse clutched in her arms.]"
"LORELAI: Mom..."
"EMILY: Lorelai. Rory. You're early. [She tries to hide her surprise.]"
"RORY: Um, yeah, we didn't hit any traffic, so..."
"EMILY: Well, I-it's nice to see you. [She approaches and deposits her coat on the back of the sofa.]"
"LORELAI: Where were you?"
"EMILY: When?"
"LORELAI: Just now."
"EMILY: O-oh, well, I had to run out to the store."
"LORELAI: To get what?"
"EMILY: They were out."
"RICHARD: Emily... the girls are early."
"EMILY: I see that. Is that ice?"
"RICHARD: Yes. We need it to make the drinks. [He spills ice on the carpet.] Oh, sh**t."
"EMILY: You should take the bucket into the kitchen the next time. [Her purse is still slung over her shoulder as she picks up scattered ice.]"
"RICHARD: Yes, that would've been the smart thing to do. Well, I was making drinks."
"EMILY: So, uh, Rory, how is school? [She is animatedly cheerful.]"
"RORY: It's fine. Um, I just got an ""A"" on a paper."
"EMILY: Oh, well, that's wonderful."
"LORELAI You gonna let go of that purse, Mom?"
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, you're holding pretty tightly to your purse there. You look like someone's Tante Flickman."
"EMILY: Oh, well, I, uh, just...there. [She reluctantly sets the purse beside her.]"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: It's new."
"LORELAI: The purse?"
"EMILY: Yes, it's new. I'm trying to break it in."
"LORELAI: Sure. Otherwise, you'd get blisters."
"RICHARD: Well, here we are. [He approaches with a full tray of drinks and passes them out.] Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"RICHARD: And soda for Rory. Emily? Well, good. [With an awkward pause, he moves to stand behind Emily.] Uh, so...Cheers."
"LORELAI: Cheers."
"RORY: Cheers."
"EMILY: Cheers."
"RICHARD: So, Rory, how's school?"
"RORY: Fine. I just got an ""A"" on a...paper."
"RICHARD: Oh."
"LORELAI: Has she told you about the traffic?"
"[The maid enters.]"
"MAID: Dinner's ready."
"LORELAI: It is?"
"EMILY: [She checks her watch.] It's only just 7:00 now."
"MAID: Oh, I'm sorry. What time did you want dinner? You didn't tell me, so..."
"EMILY: You know what? It's all right. We'll just eat now."
"LORELAI: Now?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: But what do we do with our -"
"EMILY: Just take your drinks to the table. [She rises to leave.]"
"LORELAI: [incredulous] Take our drinks to the -"
"RICHARD: Oh, I'll grab the cocktail napkins. [He rushes off to the dining room.]"
"LORELAI: But - Mom, you left your purse."
"EMILY: Oh, yes."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: I was just kidding, Mom."
"EMILY: [cheerfully] Oh, you. [She leaves the room.]"
"LORELAI: Uh, okay, so every time they ask you about school or traffic, just do a sh*t."
"RORY: Shh. [They both rise to follow Emily and Richard to the dining room.]"
"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[They are all seated, eating in silence. The only noise is the sound of utensils clinking against china. Lorelai and Rory look around the silent table. The maid enters to clear Lorelai's plate.]"
"LORELAI: Thank you. [After a long silent pause while the maid clears the rest of the dishes, Lorelai clears her throat.] So, what's for dessert?"
"EMILY: We're not having dessert."
"RORY: We're not?"
"EMILY: I-I'm on a diet."
"RICHARD: Americans are extremely fat."
"LORELAI: I think they prefer Rubenesque."
"RORY: You're not fat, Grandma."
"EMILY: Well, thank you, Lorelai. [Rory looks at Lorelai, who shrugs.]"
"LORELAI: She was close. [They all sit in silence at the long empty table.] Well, okay. If we're not having dessert, then… we should go?"
"EMILY: All right. [She tosses down her napkin and quickly rises.]"
"RICHARD: See you next Friday"
"EMILY: Thank you for coming."
"RORY: Oh. Thank you for having us."
"EMILY: Oh, wait. The Gordons' gave us some wonderful chocolate last week. They brought it back from Belgium. You can take it with you. [She exits to the kitchen.]"
"LORELAI: No, Mom, that's okay. We're fine."
"RICHARD: These are really good chocolates, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm sure they are, Dad."
"RICHARD: [calling out] Did you find them, Emily?"
"RORY: Grandpa, we can just get them next time."
"RICHARD: [cheerfully] Oh, nonsense. You can eat them on the way home. Emily?"
"EMILY: Here they are. I've got them. [She hands each of them an elegant paper bag.] One for you and one for you. Enjoy."
"LORELAI: We will. [There is a long pause as they stand awkwardly together in the dining room.] Okay, uh... we're leaving now. Have a good evening and get some sleep."
"EMILY: All right. [Lorelai gestures to hurry Rory as they exit the room.]"
"RICHARD: Good night. [Emily waves. Neither of them follows Lorelai and Rory to the door.]"
"CUT TO EXTERIOR OF ELDER GILMORE HOME"
"[The door closes behind Lorelai and Rory.]"
"LORELAI: What the hell was that?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Jack Nicholson and Angelina Jolie just kicked us out with parting gifts."
"RORY: Dessert to go."
"LORELAI: As much as the thought of an early end to Friday night dinner and dessert for the road appeals to me, that was just weird."
"RORY: [She looks inside her paper bag.] She made a tin-foil swan."
"LORELAI: What was up with the drinks and the dinner she knew nothing about, and where was she coming from, anyhow?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: She had to ""run to the store."" Since when?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: And she came back with nothing. Ooh, and the purse. Did you notice the purse?"
"RORY: They say people change as they get older. I just didn't think it was all in one week."
"LORELAI: There is something wrong here. [She notices a car parked in the driveway.] Why is my mother's car here?"
"RORY: She was in a hurry?"
"LORELAI: My mother never parks her car in the driveway, because the car might drip oil and make a spot on the concrete, and then life as we know it would end. [She approaches the car and looks in the windows.]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Just seeing what's in her car."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because -- I don't know. I just feel like something's up. [She hears a noise.] She's coming."
"RORY: Who?"
"LORELAI: Mom. Hurry. [She rushes to hide in bushes, pulling Rory with her.]"
"RORY: What are you doing? Good shoes, good shoes, good shoes."
"[Emily exits the house with dry cleaning in hand and gets inside her car. The engine turns over.]"
"LORLELAI: She's leaving."
"RORY: Where's she going?"
"LORLELAI: I don't know. She left her house with dry cleaning, and she drove off?"
"RORY: She was meeting friends?"
"LORELAI: Tonight? After dinner?"
"RORY: Maybe?"
"LORELAI: [sighs] I'm sorry. This might be crazy, but... is my mom not staying here tonight?"
"RORY: Well..."
"CUT TO STAGE OF ROCK AND ROLL GIG"
"[Loud music plays while Zach and Gil sing. Lane smiles while she plays the drums. The song ends with a big flourish. The crowd cheers loudly.]"
"LANE: Great gig! Awesome gig!"
"ZACH: [He grins at Brian.] You're starting to wheeze on the b*at, dude."
"BRIAN: I've been practicing."
"GIL: Man, I am feeling it. We have hit the next level."
"LANE: We have, haven't we?"
"GIL: You heard the crowd."
"ZACH: Dude, what was with the shirt raise?"
"GIL: Hey, man, when I'm playing like that, there is no room for clothes."
"ZACH: We need a sign, 'cause I was staring right at you when you took it off. I felt like putting a buck in your pants."
"GIL: Hey, I wouldn't turn it down."
"WOMAN: Brian, honey!"
"BRIAN: [He walks over to a table.] Hey, Mom."
"BRIAN'S DAD: You kids were excellent."
"BRIAN: Thanks, Dad. Hey, Aunt Susan. Hey...Turner."
"TURNER: [He is dressed as Zorro.] Hey, Brian."
"BRIAN'S MOM: I brought carrot sticks. You want a carrot stick, Brian?"
"BRIAN: Yeah, thanks."
"[Gil, Zach and Lane still stand on the stage.]"
"LANE: He really does wear a Zorro costume."
"GIL: I gotta go find my wife. [He leaves.]"
"LANE: I'm so jazzed right now. That was great! We have never played that good. [Zach and Lane sit on the edge of the stage.]"
"ZACH: You've never played that good."
"LANE: Really? [Zach nods.] You've never given me a compliment, ever."
"ZACH: What am I, your mother? [They both laugh.] Ew."
"LANE: What? [Zach points to a corner where Gil is passionately kissing a slinky dressed woman.] Oh."
"ZACH: Who is that?"
"LANE: I think it's his wife."
"ZACH: Seriously, that is just wrong."
"LANE: He should celebrate. We all should celebrate. Stay out all night, hit the clubs, and talk about our Rolling Stones cover -- ""Garden of Eden"" theme."
"[Two girls walk up to them.]"
"SHANNON: Hi, Zach."
"ZACH: Shannon."
"SHANNON: You remembered?"
"ZACH: I can read a napkin, sweetheart. [to the second girl] Nice pants."
"GIRL 2: You're a god."
"ZACH: And we shall discuss this further at the bar. [He puts an arm around each girl and they walks off together.] So, what did you think of the lyrics?"
"[Lane watches them leave, then glances over at Gil still making out with his wife in the corner. She wanders past the table where Brian's family is gathered and eventually sits at her drum set all alone.]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE NIGHT IN STAR'S HOLLOW - AT ""KIM'S ANTIQUES"" DOOR."
"[Lane slowly approaches the door, inserts her house key in the lock, and quietly enters. She opens her bedroom door and sees the young Korean girl sleeping in her bed. She sadly exits, pauses in the hallway, then moves to her mother's bedroom. Lane quietly enters and watches her mother sleeping peacefully. Lane gently kisses her mother's forehead and quietly leaves.]"
"CUT TO COFFEE SHOP IN HARTFORD"
"[Lorelai and Jason are seated at the counter.]"
"LORELAI: So, I spent all morning on the phone calling every hotel in the area with a decent high tea, and there she was. Grafton Hotel, room 421. Check-out date indefinite."
"JASON: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: I can't believe my parents are separated. I mean, I dreamed about this as a kid. Of course, my scenario also involved my mother finding her inner Timothy Leary and moving us all out to a commune in Berkeley, but still... I was convinced that these people should not be together, but you know what? I was wrong. Richard and Emily Gilmore were made for each other. God, this is so...freaky. And I'm not supposed to know, and of course we won't talk about it, because we don't do that in our family. We repress everything, and we refuse to go to therapy, because why tell a stranger your problems, when you can use them to punish those around you? So, what now? Every Friday I'm supposed to pretend that they still live together, and then after we leave, my mother will get in her car and drive back to the hotel? The hotel. My mother's living in a hotel. It's weird. It's just incredibly weird. [sighs] I'm sorry. I just needed to vent."
"JASON: You have every right."
"LORELAI: I'm done now. There's nothing I can do about them, so... [sighs] Talk to me. You were gonna tell me something."
"JASON: I'm suing your father. [Lorelai scoffs softly.] I have to, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: No, you don't."
"JASON: I've gone over it. I've weighed every option. I have to respond. I cannot just sit here and do nothing when my entire career is going up in flames."
"LORELAI: Jason, please. Don't do this."
"JASON: Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe he'll settle."
"LORELAI: He won't settle."
"JASON: It's just business."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God. I'm so sick of hearing people say that."
"JASON: You know I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to."
"LORELAI: You don't have to."
"JASON: If I intend to continue working in my chosen profession, then, yeah, I have to."
"LORELAI: Don't be just a business guy. Put this on another level. Please."
"JASON: I can't."
"LORELAI: Unbelievable."
"JASON: Lorelai... I have no choice. I have to fight back."
"LORELAI: Jason..."
"JASON: I will keep you out of this. I promise."
"LORELAI: [pauses] I can't be with someone who's suing my family."
"JASON: Lorelai, come on."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"JASON: You saw what your father did to me."
"LORELAI: I know what he did to you."
"JASON: And he is not gonna stop until there's nothing left."
"LORELAI: I'm asking you not to do this."
"JASON: Ask me something else. Anything else."
"LORELAI: This is what I want."
"JASON: You know how hard I work. My job is who I am. I can't lose everything. You have to understand why I'm doing this."
"LORELAI: I do understand. But I can't be with someone who's suing my family."
"JASON: Lorelai... [After a long pause, Lorelai quietly picks up her purse and walks out without looking back.]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks downstairs and opens the front door to pick up the newspaper. A cat is sitting on the porch. Lorelai goes to the phone and dials.]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: They know."
"RORY:Who knows?"
"LORELAI: The cats -- they know that I've broken up with Jason and that I'm alone and they've decided it's time for me to become a crazy cat lady."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: There's a cat on my doorstep."
"RORY: Well, that's better than a bun in your oven."
"LORELAI: It's just sitting there, staring at me, like he knew this moment was coming. It's still there. Why is it still there?"
"RORY: Mom, it's a stray. It's passing through. It's hanging out. Relax. Move away from the window and go back to bed."
"LORELAI: It's not fair. We just broke up. It just happened. I'm still young. It's still possible that I'm gonna have a successful relationship. You don't know. My eggs are still viable."
"RORY: Are you yelling at me or the cat?"
"LORELAI: The cat. I think he flipped me off with his tail. I'm Babette."
"RORY: Babette's not single."
"LORELAI: Whose side are you on? Circle the wagons."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Everyone knows. They can see it in my face. ""She's single again. She couldn't make it work again. She picked the wrong guy again."" [to cat] Hey, do not lick yourself in front of me."
"RORY: Mom, I need you to get a grip. You're tired, you're stressed out, and you're not seeing things clearly."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: There are two of them. They're not even easing me into this, those bastards. I give up. I guess I need to start collecting newspapers and magazines, find a blue bathrobe, lose my front teeth."
"RORY: Well, obviously, you've got a busy day ahead of you, so I'm gonna let you go."
"LORELAI: Yarn balls. I need to find some yarn balls."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Lorelai opens the front door.]"
"LORELAI: [to cats] Hey, I am a young, desirable woman."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is asleep. She wakes up and dials the phone.]"
"LORELAI: Michel, curtains. Tom, banister and mud-sink valve. [Tries to go back to sleep but dials the phone again.] Um...Sylvie, horse feed. Jackson, garden stone. Sookie, too much salt in gazpacho. [Sighs] Oh, boy."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is taking chairs off the tables when he sees Lorelai sitting outside the diner waiting for him to open.]"
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I need coffee."
"LUKE: It's 5:00 in the morning. Make coffee at your own house."
"LORELAI: I did. I drank it all."
"LUKE: You drank all the coffee in your house before five in the morning?"
"LORELAI: Big gulps, lots of sugar."
"LUKE: Alright, get up. [Pulls her up and takes her inside.]"
"LORELAI: And just a little bit of cream 'cause it makes it cold."
"LUKE: Keep moving."
"LORELAI: [ Sighs ] I can't sleep. I can't turn my mind off. It keeps running and thinking and making lists."
"LUKE: Maybe if you drank a little less coffee, you'd make a little less lists."
"LORELAI: Oh, I can't stop drinking the coffee. I stop drinking coffee, I stop doing the standing and walking and the words putting-into-sentence doing."
"LUKE: I'll make you some coffee."
"LORELAI: [ Sighs deeply ] If I could move, I would hug you. In fact, in my mind, I am hugging you, and also, I'm telling the plumbers that there's no water pressure in rooms 10, 12, and 15."
"LUKE: I'm making you some oatmeal."
"LORELAI: I don't like oatmeal."
"LUKE: You've got to eat something healthy."
"LORELAI: Oh, man, I'm so completely stressed. I can't remember what I'm doing from one moment to the next. It's never gonna get done."
"LUKE: It will get done."
"LORELAI: No, it won't get done, and the inn won't open, and then I'll go broke. How do you do it?"
"LUKE: Do what? Go broke?"
"LORELAI: No -- run this place, handle all the stress?"
"LUKE: The place isn't stressful."
"LORELAI: It's not?"
"LUKE: Well, actually, at this moment, it is a little."
"LORELAI: Ohhh. Maybe I can't handle it. Do you think I can handle it?"
"LUKE: I already told you you could handle it."
"LORELAI: When?"
"LUKE: Quite a while ago."
"LORELAI: Did I believe you?"
"LUKE: Apparently, you didn't even listen to me."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. I want you to take a tour of the inn."
"LUKE: Why don't I just wait till the place is repossessed? Then I can see it at public auction."
"LORELAI: How can you be so mean to me when I only managed to line one of my eyes?"
"LUKE: I apologize."
"LORELAI: Seriously, I want to give you an official investors tour. You should see the place. It's looking really good."
"LUKE: I heard the water pressure sucks in rooms 10, 12, and 15."
"LORELAI: What do you say?"
"LUKE: You eat the oatmeal, I'll take the tour."
"LORELAI: Fine, I'll eat it. But I'm making a face the entire time."
"LUKE: Looking forward to it."
"[Kirk walks in.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, Kirk. [Kirk stands beside Lorelai's table.] Something wrong?"
"KIRK: I wanted to sit there."
"LORELAI: Seriously?"
"KIRK: Of course seriously. Why do you think I'm here this early? I wanted to get that table."
"LORELAI: Every single other table in here is empty."
"KIRK: Except the one I want."
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Fine. [Gets up to move.]"
"KIRK: You have to understand that on days when Lulu is working, I have very little in my life."
"LORELAI: I know, Kirk."
"KIRK: This table is a small thing, but it makes me happy. It gives me a sense of power over my life, a little control in a world where very little is controllable."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: What?"
"LORELAI: I moved. Your table's free."
"KIRK: Oh. Well...thanks."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"KIRK: Boy, the light over here is excellent."
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Michel sits on the floor of the lobby.]"
"MICHEL: Is this your voice?"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Michel, curtains. Tom, banister and mud-sink valve."
"LORELAI: [present] Yes, that's my voice. I left myself a couple of messages last night."
"MICHEL: You left yourself 25 messages last night, and the funny thing is, you didn't listen to any of the messages. I listened to the messages."
"LORELAI: Just hand them to me, please."
"MICHEL: Every day that you breathe, you make my life harder."
"LORELAI: Got a solution for you, Michel."
"MICHEL: And when is the desk coming? I don't find the whole conducting-business-on-the-floor thing amusing anymore! I want a desk and a chair and a bell. Where the hell is my bell?!"
"[Luke walks in.]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hi. You came by."
"LUKE: You told me I had to."
"LORELAI: I'm so glad you're here."
"LUKE: Wow. The staircase is beautiful. Hey, Tom."
"TOM: Luke."
"LUKE: Yeah, nice work here. But you used glue. I thought with a banister --"
"TOM: Oh, are you gonna kibitz?"
"LUKE: What?"
"TOM: Guys who know a little about construction -- they build a birdbath, install a towel bar -- makes them think they know something, so they come in, they kibitz, offer a lot of free advice on things they don't know anything about. I got a low tolerance for that right now."
"LUKE: I'm not gonna kibitz."
"TOM: Okay. And stop touching my banister."
"LORELAI: He won't let me touch the banister either. Hey, you want to see the kitchen? The stove is a thing of beauty. We're thinking of just ordering out for everything so we never have to use it."
"LUKE: Great idea. And I wasn't gonna kibitz."
"[Lorelai and Luke walk into the kitchen where Sookie is talking to a man.]"
"SOOKIE: Exciting, isn't it? [ Laughs ] Ohh. Lorelai, great. I've been looking for you. Hi, Luke."
"LUKE: Hey, Sookie. Nice kitchen. Did you use the original tiles?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. Ask Tom."
"LUKE: Never mind."
"LORELAI: What's up?"
"SOOKIE: Lorelai, I would like to introduce you to Shel Sausman. Shel, this is Lorelai Gilmore."
"SHEL: It is really nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Well, it's nice to meet you, too."
"SOOKIE: Shel is going to be our poultry supplier."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's great."
"SOOKIE: He sells only free-range, hormone-free, and he's recently divorced."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I assume that one doesn't have anything to do with the other."
"SHEL: [ Chuckles ] You're funny. She's funny. You know, they say pretty women usually aren't funny because they never had to be. Were you a fat child?"
"SOOKIE: Um...I'm gonna go out and check with Michel on something, and you guys just talk till I get back."
"LORELAI: Hey, uh, what do you need to talk to Michel about?"
"SOOKIE: Tablecloth supplies."
"LORELAI: I can do that."
"SOOKIE: Michel likes me better. Talk! Just talk!"
"SHEL: Listen, Lorelai --"
"LORELAI: Shel, have you met Luke? Hey, Luke...Get up! Uh, Shel, this is Luke."
"SHEL: Nice to meet you."
"LUKE: Yeah, you too."
"LORELAI: Luke is my...special friend."
"SHEL: Oh?"
"LORELAI: I have to tell you, renovating this place has been a real nightmare. I just don't know how I would have gotten through it without him. [Lorelai leans against Luke and forces him to put his arm around her waist.] Have I said thank you to you recently?"
"LUKE: Uh...no."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, thank you."
"LUKE: You're welcome."
"SHEL: Well, it was nice meeting you both. I'm just gonna go say goodbye to Sookie."
"LORELAI: Oh. Bye, Shel."
"LUKE: Bye, Shel."
"LORELAI: [shoves Luke's arm away.] Don't touch my stomach."
"LUKE: You put my hand there."
"LORELAI: She's trying to set me up with Shel, the poultry guy? Why would she do that? I just broke up with someone."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: We'd been dating for a few months now."
"LUKE: I figured there was someone in the picture."
"LORELAI: You did? How?"
"LUKE: Just clues. You know, you never dressed weather-appropriate, that kind of thing."
"LORELAI: Well I can bundle on up now."
"LUKE: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: Cats came to my house today."
"LUKE: Really."
"LORELAI: Because they know I'm a loser and I'm destined to be alone."
"LUKE: You're not destined to be alone. You have Shel."
"LORELAI: Why is it so hard?"
"LUKE: What, relationships? Look who you're asking."
"LORELAI: At least you got married."
"LUKE: At least you had a kid."
"LORELAI: It makes me sad sometimes. Does it make you sad?"
"LUKE: I don't know. Maybe."
"LORELAI: Mm-hm. I see Dr. Phil books in our future."
"LUKE: Unless they stock them at Home Depot, they're not likely to cross my path."
"LORELAI: All this sad talk is putting a serious damper on my stressing."
"LUKE: The place is great."
"LORELAI: Do you think I can do this?"
"LUKE: I already told you you can do this, and I already told you that I already told you you can do this."
"LORELAI: You're making me long for Shel."
"LUKE: You'd never want for chicken."
"LORELAI: Hmm."
"CUT TO YALE -- ASHER FLEMING'S CLASSROOM"
"[Rory sits in class listening to the discussion.]"
"STUDENT: Isn't political writing just another form of propaganda?"
"ASHER: Absolutely not. Political writing confronts your assumptions."
"STUDENT: Propaganda can do that."
"[Paris appears in the doorway and waves to get Rory's attention.]"
"ASHER: No, it cannot. Propaganda merely reinforces what that person wishes to be told."
"STUDENT: That means the definition is determined by the audience."
"ASHER: That's one way of looking at it, yes."
"STUDENT: You can't do that. You can't define literature in terms of the audience."
"ASHER: Far be it from me to expect reason and common sense to triumph above youthful omniscience, so for today, we shall stop until next week."
"[Most of the students gather their books and start leaving the classroom. A few stop in the front of the room to talk to Asher. Paris comes in.]"
"PARIS: Rory, hi."
"RORY: Stop it."
"PARIS: You know, I thought I would do some laundry tonight, and I don't quite have a full load of whites, so if you have some whites, toss them in."
"RORY: I don't want to be your beard anymore, Paris. Why don't you just go talk to Asher?"
"PARIS: I don't take his class. People will get suspicious. [looks at Asher, who is still busy with students] Jeez. What, is he taking confession or something? [Rory turns to leave the room.] You can't go."
"RORY: Paris, come on. You know, I'm not gonna be in this class forever, which means next year you're gonna have to find some other idiot to stand here until the coast is clear."
"PARIS: That's alright. It's all going to be coming out eventually. Asher asked me to go to Oxford with him this summer."
"RORY: Oxford? Really? Oxford? That's -- wow. Oxford."
"PARIS: Yep."
"RORY: So, this is really getting serious."
"PARIS: Well there's now travel involved and as soon as news of the trip gets around, then I guess the secret is out."
"RORY: I guess so."
"PARIS: [sees Asher leaving] Oh, crap. Pretend you have to see him in his office."
"RORY: No!"
"PARIS: You were confused on the last point he made."
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: You were gonna ask him after class, but Toby from ""American Splendor"" wouldn't stop yapping and you couldn't."
"RORY: I feel my mouth moving, something's coming out and yet --"
"PARIS: Walk faster. We'll miss him."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW BOOK"
"[Luke pulls several audio books off the shelves and puts them under his arm.]"
"ANDREW: Did you find what you need?"
"LUKE: Oh, yeah. Fine. [Andrew reaches for the books] What are you doing?"
"ANDREW: I have to ring them up."
"LUKE: I'll just tell you the prices. This one is $24.99."
"ANDREW: That high?"
"LUKE: They're your prices."
"ANDREW: Can I just see the book?"
"LUKE: I'm reading you the book. It says right here. [looks at the price again] Oh, wait -- that's the Canadian price. $14.99."
"ANDREW: Will you just let me scan the book?"
"LUKE: When you scan the book, do you see the title?"
"ANDREW: Yes."
"LUKE: Then no."
"ANDREW: Luke, come on. What do you got there, p*rn?"
"LUKE: You sell p*rn?"
"ANDREW: No!"
"LUKE: You think I brought my own p*rn in here to buy?"
"ANDREW: I don't know what you're doing. I just need to scan the books."
"LUKE: [hands Andrew some money] This should cover it."
"ANDREW: A hundred bucks? That's way too much."
"LUKE: Take it. [leaves but comes back to the counter] Bag."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke enters the apartment, locks the door behind him, and gets out a cassette player. He puts one of the tapes he just bought in it.]"
"MAN ON CASSETTE: Love!"
"LUKE: Jeez!"
"MAN ON CASSETTE: You want it? You can have it. And not compromised, stifling, k*ll love, but open, honest, life-affirming love. But how do you get it? How do you get this love?"
"LUKE: If I knew that, what the hell would I need you for?"
"MAN ON CASSETTE: It's going to take work. It's going to take introspection. You're gonna have to learn new things -- how to be your own best friend, how to treat your damaged psyche with a little kindness, how to say, ""hey, pal, you're worth it. You mean something to someone, and you deserve love."" That is the key. If you crave love, then you deserve love. Say that to yourself. If I crave love, I deserve love. [Luke sighs deeply.] Now, how did that feel coming out? I'll bet it was hard. I'll bet you felt ridiculous. Some of you may even have been incapable of saying it at all. Try again."
"LUKE: I'm not incapable. I just haven't been hit in the head with the Oprah stick lately."
"MAN ON CASSETTE: Trust me, my friend -- it will get easier, until one day, you turn around, and you are not alone. Ready to begin the journey? It's going to be one hell of a ride. Okay, let's go. Open up your workbook to page one."
"LUKE: [opens his workbook] It doesn't get lower than this."
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN"
"LORELAI: You know Dean, we appreciate you working late all this week."
"DEAN: Hey, I appreciate the extra cash. [starts to hang a picture] Oh. Uh...the wire snapped. I can fix it."
"SOOKIE: [ Gasps ] He's like a superhero."
"LORELAI: He's like Super Mr. Fix-it man."
"SOOKIE: We'll work on a name."
"LORELAI: Your tool belt would glow."
"DEAN: I can't wait. [leaves to fix the wire]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, what did you think of the onion soup I made today?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it was good."
"SOOKIE: Good enough for the opening?"
"LORELAI: No, no, no -- we have to serve your critically acclaimed zucchini soup for the opening."
"SOOKIE: I know, but Jackson has some concerns about the zucchini crop, so I want to have a backup."
"LORELAI: No, Sookie. We've got to serve the zucchini soup. People are expecting it. The zucchini have got to be there."
"SOOKIE: Well then, I'll just tell Jackson he has to have them."
"[Sookie and Lorelai turn as they hear Lindsay and Dean arguing in the next room.]"
"LINDSAY: Dean, come on."
"DEAN: Lindsay, I'm working."
"LINDSAY: Are you? Well, how shocking."
"DEAN: What do you want me to do?"
"LINDSAY: We're supposed to go out with Erika and David tonight."
"DEAN: I can't!"
"LINDSAY: So why would you say you could?!"
"DEAN: Lindsay, I told you, if there was a chance for some extra hours --"
"LINDSAY: Oh, come on!"
"DEAN: -- that I was gonna take it."
"LINDSAY: We never do anything, Dean."
"DEAN: We need money! God! You know that, Lindsay!"
"LINDSAY: You are so incredibly selfish. You never think about me -- never."
"DEAN: You want a town house? You want a new car? We need money to pay for these things."
"LINDSAY: I sit at home all day waiting for you. You never call during the day, like you always promise you will."
"DEAN: God, Lindsay!"
"LINDSAY: I'm bored, Dean. Don't you care about that? I want to go out with my husband. Hello! We're married here!"
"DEAN: Well, I'll be done in a couple of hours. If you want to--"
"LINDSAY: I'm going out with Erika and David."
"DEAN: Fine. Go. When will you be home?"
"LINDSAY: When I get home."
"DEAN: That's nice, Lindsay. That's real nice."
"LINDSAY: Whatever, Dean."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREET"
"[Luke is in his truck listening to his self-help tapes. He stops the truck but continues listening.]"
"MAN ON CASSETTE: Complete the following sentence -- I feel angry because..."
"LUKE: I am listening to this tape."
"MAN ON CASSETTE: I feel hopeful because..."
"LUKE: This tape must end eventually."
"MAN ON CASSETTE: I feel helpless because..."
"LUKE: I wonder if anyone's ever kicked an audiotape's ass. [Liz runs up to the truck and knocks on his window. T.J. is with her.] Jeez. Hold on. [Luke stops the tape and gets out of the truck.] What are you doing here?"
"LIZ: Look how happy he is to see me."
"LUKE: I just didn't expect it, that's all."
"LIZ: Oh, my brother. You remember T.J., right?"
"T.J.: I'm still here."
"LUKE: How you doin', T.J.?"
"T.J.: How am I doing? Huh. Lizzie, I don't know. How am I doing?"
"LIZ: He's doing great! 'Cause we're getting married."
"LUKE: Married? Really?"
"LIZ: And we're doing it right here next week."
"LUKE: Wow, that's fast."
"LIZ: I know but we wanted to do it before the circuit got going so all our friends could come. It gonna be so beautiful. Wait till you see."
"T.J.: You ever been to a Renaissance wedding?"
"LUKE: No, I haven't."
"T.J.: Oh, it's great -- horses, costumes, really big turkey legs. You're gonna love it."
"LUKE: Okay, you gotta slow down here."
"LIZ: No way. You slow down and you die."
"LUKE: When did this happen?"
"LIZ: Last week. T.J. asked me, I said yes, we made a few phone calls, and here we are, grabbing life by the ping-pongs, as T.J. says."
"T.J.: Hey, there's gonna be a bachelor party, too. My brother's coming down, got a couple of friends dropping in. It's going to be a blast. You have to go."
"LUKE: Oh, sure, if you want me to."
"T.J.: Want you to? Of course I want you to. What are you talking about? I want you to be my best man also."
"LUKE: You're kidding."
"T.J.: Of course I am. You'd be like 800th on the list. But you can come to the bachelor party if you want."
"LIZ: Are you happy for me? Say you're happy for me."
"LUKE: Sure, I'm happy for you. Of course I'll go to your bachelor party."
"T.J.: Good. Keeping up appearances that we like each other -- very classy for the wedding."
"LUKE: T.J., come on."
"T.J.: Okay, I'm going to get some beer. [He walks away. Liz and Luke start walking towards the diner.]"
"LUKE: Where's he going? He doesn't know where to go."
"LIZ: He's got a nose for these things. Oh, wait till you see this wedding. Oh, my God. It's unbelievable. I'm wearing a white dress..."
"LUKE: That is unbelievable."
"LIZ: Oh, stop it. It's about a zillion years old with flowing sleeves. I'm like Vanessa Redgrave in ""Camelot."" Seriously, I love myself in this dress."
"LUKE: Sounds like a good dress."
"LIZ: I'm so excited. I'm getting married...again."
"LUKE: So, how are you gonna do this so quickly?"
"LIZ: Well, we're gonna have the ceremony right out there in the square. We've got our Renaissance Fair buds all pitching in. We got the Scotch-egg guy to cater it and T.J.'s gonna write the vows. You won't have to do a thing."
"LUKE: Oh, sure."
"LIZ: I swear -- everything's taken care of. Carrie's gonna be my maid of honor."
"LUKE: Terrific."
"LIZ: She's a good friend."
"LUKE: To one and all. So, does Jess know?"
"LIZ: He knows."
"LUKE: Did he take it well?"
"LIZ: Took it like Jess."
"LUKE: Meaning?"
"LIZ: He's not coming."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"LIZ: He's young, he's busy."
"LUKE: Busy doing what?"
"LIZ: I don't know. It's okay. I just thought -- but it's no biggie. I mean, hey, I got you there, right?"
"LUKE: Yeah, you do."
"LIZ: Are you gonna dress up?"
"LUKE: Absolutely."
"LIZ: As a minstrel?"
"LUKE: Sure. Who's the guy who jumps around in bells and a pointy hat?"
"LIZ: The court jester."
"LUKE: Yes, the court jester. I will come as a court jester."
"LIZ: You're a good brother. You got any of that terrible peach pie you make? I'm starving."

"[Lorelai places a pizza on a candy-filled coffee table as Rory walks in the front door.]"
"RORY: Hello."
"LORELAI: Did you bring the Nutter Butters?"
"RORY: Well, I'm fine, Mother. I missed you, too."
"LORELAI: Ah, we have achieved culinary perfection."
"RORY: What's with the carrots?"
"LORELAI: I was afraid you weren't eating right at school."
"RORY: Ah."
"LORELAI: Marshmallow?"
"RORY: Thank you. Oh, man, I've missed Al's Chinese night."
"LORELAI: Oh, he's got a new thing now -- chicken chow mein sandwich."
"RORY: Oh, Al."
"LORELAI: Oh, Al."
"RORY: So what exactly was Grandma's excuse for canceling Friday night dinner?"
"LORELAI: That Dad was traveling and she had a function."
"RORY: It was that generic?"
"LORELAI: She put no thought into it, and it was muffled, but at the end of the call, I do believe I heard a knock and someone yelling, ""turndown service."""
"RORY: Living in a hotel."
"LORELAI: And hiding it."
"RORY: Poor Grandma. We should talk to them."
"LORELAI: ""We""?"
"RORY: Well, you. I'm a child."
"LORELAI: Talking is not my parents' thing. It would humiliate them if they knew that we knew that they are...whatever they are."
"RORY: So, we do nothing?"
"LORELAI: I guess we wait until one of them cracks."
"RORY: Okay. Man, how many tapes are we watching tonight?"
"LORELAI: Well, every time I started watching something that I thought you would like, I stopped watching it and I saved it for when we could watch it together, so I watched the first 10 minutes of 12 movies."
"RORY: So which one are we gonna watch?"
"LORELAI: Mmm...the absolute funniest movie known to man -- ""Fatso."""
"RORY: I'm loving the title."
"LORELAI: Anne Bancroft wrote and directed it."
"RORY: Well, Annie Sullivan, look at you go. So how's everything at the inn coming along?"
"LORELAI: Everyone's freaking out because I got a million things to do, but we finally got the pictures up, and the beds were delivered today. Oh, I forgot -- a little bit of gossip."
"RORY: Oh. What?"
"LORELAI: No, it's not fun gossip."
"RORY: What? What?"
"LORELAI: Well, Sookie and I overheard Dean and Lindsay having a major fight. It was ugly."
"RORY: Really? About what?"
"LORELAI: Well, she was mad because he was working late to make some extra cash, and she wanted to go out, and it got heated and vicious, and the whole thing ended with a ""Whatever, Dean."""
"RORY: That sounds bad."
"LORELAI: It wasn't good."
"RORY: Maybe they'll make up."
"LORELAI: I hope so."
"RORY: Yeah, me too."

"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Luke walks up to apartment F and knocks on the door. Jess opens it.]"
"LUKE: Hey, neighbor, the guys next door just ran out of crack to sell, so they sent me over to borrow a cup. Hey, nice place. You put those holes there yourself?"
"JESS: What are you doing here?"
"LUKE: Just wanted to see how you were doing."
"JESS: Doing great."
"LUKE: Great, you're doing great. Wow, you're doing great. I'm not doing great, and I have running water."
"JESS: The place is fine."
"LUKE: Fine. Not great? What happened to great?"
"JESS: All this and no housewarming gift."
"LUKE: Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I just thought you were going absolutely nowhere with your life. Glad I'm wrong. Hey, which filthy mattress is yours?"
"JESS: Right there."
"LUKE: Oh. Well, you got the good corner, with a view of the mold."
"JESS: Yeah, I won the toss. Now, if you don't mind, I've got places to be."
"LUKE: Let's get down to it. Liz told me you weren't coming to the wedding."
"JESS: No way you're here about that."
"LUKE: I am here about that."
"JESS: Why?"
"LUKE: Why? Your mother's getting married, and you're not coming."
"JESS: No biggie. I'll just catch the next one."
"LUKE: Jess, this guy is different."
"JESS: Come on."
"LUKE: Well he could be different. He seems different."
"JESS: Jeez, man."
"LUKE: I've seen him with Liz. They seem to work. We need to support this thing to give it a chance."
"JESS: No, we don't."
"LUKE: You are gonna regret this."
"JESS: I doubt it."
"LUKE: No, you are. If you ever manage to grow up and get yourself together and drop this selfish self-destructive behavior that you are so fond of, if that ever happens, you are gonna look back on this moment and you are gonna feel like a big steaming mound of crap that you missed this. This could have been a turning point. You could have witnessed something good for your mother who, yes, has screwed up a bit in her life but now seems to have found something to make her happy, and you miss that, you refuse to be a part of that, you are gonna be very sorry. [Beeping] What, are you a drug dealer now?"
"JESS: I'm a messenger. I gotta go. Hey, Todd, it's 4:00."
"LUKE: You owe me. I was there for you when no one else was, and I want you there...and you owe me."
"JESS: I gotta go."
"LUKE: So do I. I'm going first. [Storms out the door.]"
"JESS: Hey, Todd. [Follows Luke out.]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is on the phone when Lorelai walks in.]"
"LUKE: No, Roy, I know what I'm talking about. I'm looking for stalks of wheat, not processed wheat, stalks. That's putting it another way. I need bare-ass stalks. [to customer] Sorry. [to Roy] I know you can't eat it like that. I just need it for decoration. No, I'm not going poofy on you, damn it! [to another customer] Sorry. [to Roy] I just need to know whether you have it or not. No? Okay, whatever. Thanks. [hangs up] Is there no wheat left in this country? What happened to Kansas? Isn't Kansas lousy with wheat?"
"LORELAI: I do recall Toto running through fields of it. Coffee to go, please."
"LUKE: That I can get."
"LORELAI: Why do you need wheat?"
"LUKE: Liz's wedding."
"LORELAI: Liz is getting married?"
"LUKE: She and T.J."
"LORELAI: Did I know this?"
"LUKE: I guess not."
"LORELAI: In New York?"
"LUKE: Here in the square, a Renaissance thing."
"LORELAI: Could I be a little more behind?"
"LUKE: I got sucked in, just like always. First day, their cellphone died, so I let them use the phone. Then I offered to make the call 'cause I happened to know the person they were calling, and I had to go pick something up because I couldn't find T.J. to do it. And kapow, I'm hunting down wheat stalks and looking for local pewter craftsmen. Do you have any idea where I can find myrtle?"
"LORELAI: Did you check the bingo parlor?"
"LUKE: The plant."
"LORELAI: Hey, don't add stuff from your to-do list to my to-do list."
"LUKE: Sorry. Here's your coffee."
"LORELAI: Thank you. So, I can't believe I didn't know about this wedding. I'm caught up on everything now, right?"
"LUKE: I'd say so."
"[Jess walks in and heads for the stairs.]"
"JESS: I'm not paying for a motel, so I'm staying with you."
"LORELAI: Liar!"
"LUKE: I wasn't sure he was coming. I went to see him in New York."
"LORELAI: You went to New York? I needed things picked up in New York."
"LUKE: Hey, don't add stuff from your to-do list to my to-do list."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"LUKE: It's okay."
"LORELAI: I should go. Hey, do you know that if the entire population of China walked by, the line would never end because of the rate of population increase?"
"LUKE: No, I didn't."
"LORELAI: That's my list -- every Chinese person in the world."
"LUKE: Scary."
"LORELAI: Scary."
"CUT TO YALE"
"[Glenn sits on the back of a couch talking to a girl.]"
"GLENN: What do you think? Friday night good?"
"GIRL: I'm busy, Glenn."
"GLENN: You're never busy on Friday nights. You always eat dinner early on Fridays and watch TV and go to bed around 10:30."
"GIRL: You're spying on me?! [Gets up and walks away.]"
"GLENN: Close your blinds if you're gonna be so sensitive."
"[Rory walks by, her cell phone ringing.]"
"RORY: Hello? Paris, slow down. Where are you? Stop saying ""the hospital."" There are tons of hospitals. Which hospital?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"JESS: Ah, you're here."
"LUKE: I do show up occasionally."
"JESS: The place looks the same. Is that your dinner?"
"LUKE: Couldn't book my usual table at Le Cirque."
"JESS: Right. I wasn't sure what food I could eat. [looks in the refrigerator]"
"LUKE: Eat what you like. Start with the expired stuff."
"JESS: Maybe I'll go out."
"LUKE: I'm hearing a good buzz about a chow mein sandwich."
"[Jess sees Luke's tape player and starts to press play. Luke jumps up to stop him.]"
"JESS: What's on the playlist these days? I'm guessing Jethro Tull or Jethro Tull."
"LUKE: Just stay away from that."
"JESS: What's with you?"
"LUKE: Never mind. Look, eat my food, use my shower. Just don't go poking around my stuff."
"JESS: Mr. Sensitive. [goes to the door]"
"LUKE: Whatever. Enjoy your evening."
"JESS: Don't wait up."
"[Luke locks the door behind Jess and puts the tape on.]"
"MAN ON CASSETTE: You're a road in need of some repair. If your score is between 30 and 40 points, then you're a road laden with potholes and you need a double striping. And if your score is 40 or above, it's jackhammer time because your road is impassable."
"LUKE: [sarcastically] Yikes."
"MAN ON CASSETTE: Chapter 7. Men, a question -- what is fantasy? The answer -- fantasy is the imaginative fulfillment of your heart's desire. And one of the most common fantasies for single men is the fantasy of your ultimate companion."
"LUKE: Yada yada yada."
"MAN ON CASSETTE: Story time. I had a friend -- let's call him Phillip -- who couldn't make up his mind amongst three different women that he liked. I developed a test for him...and for you."
"LUKE: [sarcastically] Oh, goody."
"MAN ON CASSETTE: Whose phone calls or visits are never unwanted or too long? Do you see her face? Who would you most like to have in your life to ward off moments of loneliness? Do you see her face? When you travel, who would make your travels more enjoyable? Do you see her face? When you're in pain, who would you most like to comfort you? Do you see her face? When something wonderful happens in your life -- a promotion at work, a successful refinancing -- who do you want to share the news with? Do you see her face? Whose face appears to you, my friend? Whose face?"
"LUKE: Whoa."

"CUT TO HOSPITAL"
"[Rory enters an elevator with some hospital staff.]"
"RORY: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure which floor to go to. I've been getting conflicting advice. A friend of mine is here, but she didn't say exactly where, so I'm just wondering -- [trails off as she hears Paris's voice through the elevator doors]"
"PARIS: Why do I have to say everything twice? Huh? Why? I don't want my time wasted that way. You don't want your time wasted that way. Lives are dependent on you very people not wasting your time. I came here because of your reputation. Don't make me destroy that reputation."
"DOCTOR: Miss, you have to lower your voice."
"PARIS: That is Professor Asher Fleming in there, of Yale University. He's an important man, and you're acting like you're about to sell his spleen to UCLA."
"DOCTOR: The procedures are the procedures."
"PARIS: Oh, really? I thought the procedures were a hat. Hit me with some more lame tautology, Socrates."
"DOCTOR: That's enough. Now, calm down, take a seat, and let us continue our work."
"PARIS: Oh, you men, always telling us to calm down. Me, Hillary, Martha -- the second we make a squeak, you're pushing us onto the fainting couch."
"NURSE: Honey, please."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Asher asked for a moistened towel 20 minutes ago, and no one's brought him a moistened towel. This man is an award-winning novelist, a sought-after lecturer. He deserves a moistened towel! Give me a towel! I'll moisten the damn thing myself!"
"RORY: Paris, come on. Fill me in here."
"PARIS: Stat! Stat! Do you not know what ""stat"" means? They say it on all the hospital shows."
"RORY: Come on, Paris. What's happening?"
"PARIS: It's Asher."
"RORY: I know, what's happening?"
"PARIS: We were out getting some gelato and he dropped his spoon, and when I picked it up, he started to lean on me like he was about to fall, and he was having these pains."
"RORY: Oh my God."
"PARIS: So we sat down, and he said he was fine, but I got worried because he looked so pale, so I rushed him here to this chop shop masquerading as a hospital, and I can't get anyone to help him."
"RORY: This is a really good hospital. They know what they're doing."
"PARIS: He wanted a towel."
"RORY: They'll get him one."
"PARIS: And they wouldn't let me see even him because I'm not a blood relative. He's got two grown kids. Where are they? I mean, you put food on their table, a roof over their heads, and this is how they repay you?"
"RORY: What's doctor saying? Is it serious?"
"PARIS: It wasn't a heart attack. It was angina or something. I think he's gonna be fine."
"RORY: Good."
"PARIS: But..."
"RORY: But what?"
"PARIS: The wobbly, the look on his face, the angina...he's old."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Asher. He has pains, he wobbles."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"PARIS: I spotted him through the curtain when the doctor came out, and he was just lying on that bed all alone, and he had his eyes open and was just staring at the ceiling. He looked so close to death."
"RORY: He's not that close."
"PARIS: He's closer than me."
"RORY: An anvil could hit you on the head tomorrow, and he could live another 40 years."
"PARIS: I'm 19. I should be rollicking. Asher doesn't rollick."
"RORY: Well he probably didn't rollick when he was younger either. He's British."
"PARIS: You should have seen the way he was staring at the ceiling, like he was looking at God."
"RORY: He wasn't looking at God."
"PARIS: You've probably been laughing at me all these months."
"RORY: Paris, no, I haven't."
"PARIS: I'm in a hospital. I should be at a discotheque. Are kids still into the discotheque?"
"RORY: Paris, come on. Let's go get you something to drink. Let the hospital do their work."
"PARIS: He orders old gelato."
"RORY: Old gelato?"
"PARIS: Vanilla. It's a very old flavor."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai, Sookie and Michel are working on Lorelai's to-do list for the inn.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I hate these pillows with a passion."
"SOOKIE: They look good."
"LORELAI: Good, not great?"
"SOOKIE: They look great."
"LORELAI: Great, not fabulous?"
"SOOKIE: Fabulous."
"LORELAI: Fabulous, not mondo-fabulous?"
"SOOKIE: Come on."
"MICHEL: They look good to me."
"LORELAI: Good, not great?"
"SOOKIE: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Twenty-eight to go."
"MICHEL: Does it bother you that the word ""laundry"" is misspelled?"
"LORELAI: [Gasps] No! I proofed these pages a million times. That breaks my heart. L-a-u-n-d-r-y. That's right."
"MICHEL: No, it's d-r-i-e."
"LORELAI: No, laundry -- l-a-u-n-d-r-y."
"SOOKIE: There's a ""u?"" There's no ""u."""
"MICHEL: There's a ""u"" but no ""y."""
"LORELAI: There's a ""y"" but no ""i-e,"" and a ""u."""
"SOOKIE: Or a ""u."""
"LORELAI: No, no. There's a ""u."" There's no ""i-e."" It's a ""y"" -- this is giving me a headache."
"MICHEL: Does ""consommé"" have two m's?"
"LORELAI: Hey, Abbott, just assemble the books."
"MICHEL: It's getting late."
"LORELAI: How late can you stay, Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: As late as you want -- Davey's with his grandparents, and Jackson's sleeping with the zucchini tonight."
"LORELAI: What's that, farm jargon?"
"SOOKIE: No, he's sleeping with the zucchini."
"LORELAI: But what does that mean, sleeping with the zucchini?"
"SOOKIE: It means he's sleeping with the zucchini."
"LORELAI: Sookie, fill me in here. Where's Jackson?"
"SOOKIE: Well, he checked the forecast today, and there's a potential cold front coming in from Canada, and he knows how important the zucchini is for opening day menu, so..."
"LORELAI: Are you saying that ""sleeping with the zucchini"" means..."
"SOOKIE: He's sleeping with the zucchini."
"MICHEL: She's said it four times. You're very slow tonight."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: Well, you said to do whatever it takes to make sure we have fresh zucchini."
"LORELAI: Within the realm of reason."
"SOOKIE: Oh. Now you add that. [Lorelai sighs and stands up.] Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: To the zucchini patch. [Sookie follows Lorelai.]"
"MICHEL: All of us or..."
"LORELAI: Michel!"
"CUT TO STRIP CLUB"
"[Luke enters with T.J. and a group of guys.]"
"T.J.'S BROTHER: Boys, we have arrived."
"T.J.: You said it, brother, my brother. [sees Luke with his hand on his stomach] Stomachache?"
"LUKE: I'm fine."
"T.J.: Check out the fresh nooks."
"LUKE: Nice and fresh."
"T.J.: Not your scene?"
"LUKE: Not really."
"T.J.: Mine neither. This is for the guys. These days, there's nothing I'd rather do in the world than spoon with your sister. [Luke exhales sharply.] Stomach again?"
"LUKE: That time, yeah."
"T.J.: Let's grab seats before they're all taken."
"DANCER: Lap dance?"
"LUKE: Oh, no, thanks. I'm just here for a bachelor party."
"DANCER: That's kind of why I'm here, too."
"LUKE: Well, thanks for the offer, but, no, thank you. But thank you. It was nice. Thanks. Thank you."
"DANCER: Thank you."
"T.J.: Luke, come on. You should get a lap dance."
"LUKE: I'm fine."
"T.J.: Are you gonna stand all night?"
"LUKE: If I stand, there's no lap to dance on. Everything will be easier."
"T.J.: Wow. That's something there."
"LUKE: What's is?"
"T.J.: What you just said about your lap. The fact is, there is no such thing as a lap."
"T.J.'S BROTHER: Come on."
"T.J.: Think about it -- it's there when you're sitting, but it's gone when you stand, so where does it go? It doesn't go anywhere, meaning...it never was. So a lap is just an illusion."
"T.J.'S BROTHER: Whoa. The way his mind works."
"LUKE: Oh, it's something else. [Jess comes over to the group.] Where have you been?"
"JESS: Bathroom. It's best to use it before the puking starts."
"LUKE: You left me hanging with the Lords of Flatbush here."
"JESS: Sorry. Aren't you gonna sit?"
"T.J.: He doesn't want to make a lap."
"T.J.'s BROTHER: A lap is an illusion."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: Don't get him started."
"T.J.: Hey, I want to talk to you later."
"JESS: I always enjoy a good palaver."
"T.J.: Huh?"
"JESS: We'll talk. [pulls out a book]"
"CUT TO HOSPITAL"
"PARIS: Thanks for the drink. I owe you."
"RORY: You don't owe me anything."
"NURSE: You can go in now."
"PARIS: Thank you. Well, I think I'm going to go talk to him."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: And have the talk -- a real talk."
"RORY: Oh. Now?"
"PARIS: This can't go on. It's too weird. Tonight's been sort of an eye-opener."
"RORY: Well, it's up to you."
"PARIS: We're supposed to leave for England in two weeks. I shouldn't string him along."
"RORY: Right. Now is good, and to do it is good...for a number of reasons."
"PARIS: What reasons?"
"RORY: I just meant all the reasons that you already know."
"PARIS: Wait for me -- take me home?"
"RORY: Yeah. I'll be right out here."
"[Paris goes into Asher's room.]"
"PARIS: Asher?"
"ASHER: Paris? Come, come. You needn't have stayed."
"PARIS: Oh, no. I mean, I had the keys."
"ASHER: Then it was very convenient that you did stay."
"PARIS: Did you ever get your towel?"
"ASHER: Five of them. And I'm very grateful. Thank you, angel. [notices Paris looking uncomfortable] Yes?"
"PARIS: Are you feeling better?"
"ASHER: Oh, I'm feeling much better."
"PARIS: Good, good. I'm glad. I mean, you read all these awful stories in the paper -- you know, a guy comes in with a stomachache, and they amputate his foot."
"ASHER: Paris...come sit down. You know, a hospital seems a wonderful place to discuss something serious, doesn't it?"
"PARIS: I guess."
"ASHER: I want you to know that I'm grateful for every moment that we've spent together this past year. You're wonderful company. [Sighs] I don't think I've said that enough."
"PARIS: No. You have."
"ASHER: You know, I've had other relationships like this. You may have heard talk."
"PARIS: Oh, I rarely listen to anything anybody says."
"ASHER: I didn't want you to think that I was hiding anything. I want to be honest with you."
"PARIS: Thank you."
"ASHER: There's something very unique about you, Paris -- quite out of the ordinary."
"PARIS: A lot of people have said I'm not ordinary."
"ASHER: You know, I'm going to be very busy at Oxford. I've been writing down all the places that I wanted to take you, things you should see, but I'm afraid there's not enough time."
"PARIS: Oh."
"ASHER: So, I was thinking of going alone. Oh, I'd like you to go, but I don't want you to be bored."
"PARIS: You've been writing down places?"
"ASHER: I'd forgotten how many there were. So, if you want to reassess, I will completely understand."
"PARIS: Do you...want to reassess?"
"ASHER: No. I don't want to go alone, and I don't want to go with anyone else. But, then, I'm selfish. I get to be. After all, I'm...old."
"PARIS: You're not so old."
"[Rory reads a magazine in the waiting area. A woman about her age walks up to the nurse.]"
"ANDREA: Hi. I'm looking for Asher Fleming."
"NURSE: He's getting dressed. He should be out in a minute."

"RORY: He'll be all yours in a minute, girlfriend."
"[Paris and Asher come out of his room.]"
"ASHER: Miss Gilmore."
"RORY: Hello, Professor."
"RORY: You ready?"
"PARIS: That's okay. I'm going to go with Asher. We're going to do some more planning for England."
"RORY: England? But I thought --"
"ASHER: Andrea, what brought you here?"
"ANDREA: Mom called."
"ASHER: Paris, Rory, this is my granddaughter, Andrea."
"PARIS: Hi."
"ANDREA: Hi."
"RORY: Hey, there. Wow. It's really nice to meet you. I'm gonna be going home now because there's no rest for the wicked. So I'll see you at home."
"PARIS: See you there."
"RORY: I'll just see you in class there, Asher -- uh, Professor. It's really nice meeting you. Bye."
"CUT TO STRIP CLUB"
"T.J.'S BROTHER: I love mud, I love wrestling, I love girls. This is everything I love."
"T.J.: In one neat package. [looks over at Jess, who is reading] Here's our boy. You having a good time?"
"JESS: Oh, I'm having a gay old time."
"T.J.: You know, you read so much, I'm thinking of nicknaming you ""Reads."""
"JESS: Good one."
"T.J.: Tough guy, huh?"
"JESS: What?"
"T.J.: Listen, your mom has this thought she hasn't shared with you because she's afraid you wouldn't be into it."
"JESS: Oh yeah?"
"T.J.: She'd like you to walk her down the aisle. Usually it's the father that would do that, but he's worm food."
"JESS: I knew that."
"T.J.: So, what do you say?"
"JESS: I don't think so."
"T.J.: She really wants you to."
"JESS: I really don't want to."
"T.J.: I'd like it, too."
"JESS: Oh, you too?"
"T.J.: Yeah."
"JESS: I don't think so."
"T.J.: It's a really short aisle. It'll be over in a flash."
"JESS: Get Luke to do it."
"T.J.: She wants you to do it."
"JESS: I guess we're at a stalemate."
"T.J.: I don't think we're at a stalemate."
"JESS: There's girls wallowing around in slimy dirt, and you're looking at me?"
"T.J.: I don't want to tell your mom no."
"JESS: Then I'll tell her."
"T.J.: I don't want you telling her either."
"JESS: Want to pitch in for a telegram?"
"[T.J. flips Jess' book away. Jess shoves T.J. and the bachelor party breaks out into a brawl.]"

"CUT TO ZUCCHINI PATCH"
"MICHEL: Oh, my God. I hate nature."
"LORELAI: Ow! Jackson!"
"JACKSON: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: What are you doing here?"
"JACKSON: I'm sleeping with the zucchini. Didn't you tell her that I was sleeping with the zucchini?"
"SOOKIE: She had a little trouble grasping that concept."
"LORELAI: I do not want you to sleep with the zucchini."
"JACKSON: You said it was important."
"LORELAI: They are."
"JACKSON: And to keep them safe, no matter what it takes. And there's a possibility of a cold front."
"SOOKIE: I told her about the cold front."
"LORELAI: That's why you have heaters."
"JACKSON: But the heaters could fail, so I'm here to service them."
"LORELAI: So technically, you're sleeping with the heaters?"
"JACKSON: I guess so."
"LORELAI: But I don't want you to do that either."
"MICHEL: It's cold."
"LORELAI: Sit down here. It's warm down here. Jackson, I love you. I love that you're doing this, but I also feel like I should call the guys with butterfly nets to come get you...and me and all of us."
"JACKSON: Well..."
"LORELAI: I'm so sorry, guys."
"SOOKIE: For what?"
"LORELAI: For freaking out about dumb things like zucchini and not realizing that people would respond in very loving and nutty ways. This is not the way to do this. We're too stressed out. We're not having fun. This whole inn experience is flying by. Tonight it stops."
"SOOKIE: Sounds good to me."
"MICHEL: It is nice and warm here."
"LORELAI: Here's what we do. We each have to drop something off our list -- something big -- and the others get to pick for the person, and the person cannot refuse a reasonable request to drop something."
"SOOKIE: Like a game."
"LORELAI: And we all win."
"SOOKIE: You're dropping the pillows."
"LORELAI: Okay, the pillows are history."
"SOOKIE: Good."
"LORELAI: Okay, you are dropping two desserts off the menu. A selection of six is all people need."
"JACKSON: I'll second that."
"SOOKIE: I can live with that."
"LORELAI: And Michel, you're no longer asking for 10 references from every person we're hiring."
"MICHEL: But they are all such imbeciles. How else will we know?"
"LORELAI: We're capping it at three."
"MICHEL: Five."
"LORELAI: Four."
"MICHEL: I guess four's okay. It really is comfortable here."
"LORELAI: I'm actually relieved about the pillows. [Jackson lays his head in Sookie's lap.]"
"SOOKIE: You'll do them later."
"JACKSON: Are you guys seeing these stars? [They all look up, then lie back.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, beautiful."
"SOOKIE: I haven't looked at the stars in ages."
"LORELAI: That's another rule. We all have to look at the stars more often."
"SOOKIE: Done."
"MICHEL: I'm very comfortable."
"LORELAI: Me too."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke and Jess walk in the door.]"
"LUKE: Hmm. Tonight I got into a fight at a strip club with my nephew. A fight. I haven't been in a fight since sixth grade. Vince Williams called me a doodyhead. I took it very personally. But you know what? Tonight was good. Tonight something happened to me. I achieved this great sense of calm. No more anger, no more frustration. Live and let live. You are who you are. I cannot change that, and I'm gonna stop trying. I wish I'd felt this earlier. Then I wouldn't have dragged you down here. I apologize for that. But, I mean, if you really hate your mother that much, then you shouldn't be here, you shouldn't walk her down the aisle, and you shouldn't go to her wedding."
"JESS: I don't hate my mother."
"LUKE: You don't? Well, then, I don't get it. Why weren't you coming -- because of me? You hate me that much?"
"JESS: I don't hate you. [Sighs] I came here because of you."
"LUKE: Stop that."
"JESS: You said it was important to you. Remember?"
"LUKE: I didn't think you were listening."
"JESS: I was listening."
"LUKE: So, you don't hate your mom, you don't hate me, so...why weren't you coming? [ Sighs ] No. Rory still? That's ancient history. You haven't seen her in a year."
"JESS: I saw her when I was here a few months ago."
"LUKE: I didn't know that. So, what happened?"
"JESS: Nothing. I told her, uh..."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: I told her I loved her."
"LUKE: Wow! What did she say?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"LUKE: What, you just said it and walked away?"
"JESS: No. I got in my car and left."
"LUKE: You just dropped the b*mb and ran?"
"JESS: I drove."
"LUKE: You didn't want stick around to see what she said?"
"JESS: No. And obviously, she had nothing to say."
"LUKE: How do you know?"
"JESS: She could have contacted me anytime in the last three months, but she didn't."
"LUKE: What are you talking about? You change your phone number weekly."
"JESS: [Scoffs] The ball was in her court."
"LUKE: Oh, Jess, come on. You did this completely wrong. Open two-way communication is the foundation of love, and you cut that off. I had this friend -- let's call him Phillip -- who thought expressing intimacy was a favor to his partner, but expressions of intimacy should be given freely and frequently. He loved Judy, but he used his love as a bargaining tool."
"JESS: Who the hell is Judy?"
"LUKE: Phillip's wife. We call her Judy."
"JESS: I wasn't bargaining."
"LUKE: You were bargaining. You had expectations out of line with what you deserved. You don't nurture."
"JESS: Where are you getting this junk?"
"LUKE: Life. I've lived."
"JESS: What, in a Bette Midler movie?"
"LUKE: I'm just trying to help you out."
"JESS: Oh, please. You are the most dysfunctional person I know."
"LUKE: Not anymore."
"JESS: Your marriage to Nicole -- nothing but weird."
"LUKE: I'm better now."
"JESS: Yeah, right. Right. Oh, man. We're just a couple of losers."
"LUKE: Well, things change, my friend."
"JESS: Oh, yeah?"
"LUKE: Stay tuned. [starts to go upstairs] You really told her you loved her? Huh."

"MICHEL: We slept with the zucchini?"
"LORELAI: We slept with the zucchini."

"LORELAI: Oh, you know, the zucchini patch."
"LUKE: Huh?"
"LORELAI: It's a long story. No, it's short. I slept in the zucchini patch."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: So, what are you doing here?"
"LUKE: Well, I wanted to talk to you."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: I got that wedding coming up, Liz's wedding."
"LORELAI: I know."
"LUKE: I know you're busy with your to-do list and all, but I think you could use a little break."
"LORELAI: Oh, I could use a little break."
"LUKE: Take a break with me. Come to the wedding."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: It should be fun. There'll be turkey legs."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, sure."
"LUKE: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LUKE: Good. Yes, good."
"LORELAI: All right, then."
"LUKE: I'll meet you at your house. We'll walk over together, okay?"
"LORELAI: Great."
"LUKE: Okay. Good. I'll see you then."
"LORELAI: Or before then."
"LUKE: Either way is good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, me too."
"LUKE: Oh, and you don't have to wear a fruity outfit."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm gonna be a little fruity."
"LUKE: That's good, too."
"CUT TO LUKE's APARTMENT"
"[Jess is watching TV. Luke walks in smiling.]"
"JESS: What is it with you?"
"LUKE: [picks up his tape player and workbooks and gives them to Jess] Here. I'm done with them. Enjoy."

"[Miss Patty is trying to get a group of children to dance around a Maypole. Kirk watches from the side of the gazebo.]"
"MISS PATTY: No, no, boys. You go clockwise! Clockwise! Can't you tell time?"
"CHRISSY: The other way, boys! They're not getting it, Miss Patty."
"MISS PATTY: Well, the wedding's tomorrow. We gotta get it."
"CHRISSY: It's the Banyan boys. They won't do what I tell them."
"KIRK: Nice maypole, Patty! Really organized!"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, shut up, Kirk!"
"LORELAI: Tough day, Patty?"
"MISS PATTY: I've worked with Joan Crawford. This is worse."
"KIRK: I don't call that a ""maypole."" I'd call that a ""maybe-not pole."""
"LORELAI: What's with him?"
"MISS PATTY: He's mad because I made Chrissy my dance captain over him."
"LORELAI: Kirk has forty-three jobs."
"MISS PATTY: Would you go talk to him, please? I got my hands full here."
"LORELAI: The Banyan boys?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh! Lucifer tired of them in hell and dumped them here."
"LORELAI: I'll talk to Kirk."
"MISS PATTY: Thank you. All right, Chrissy, let's give it another go!"
"LORELAI: Hey, Kirk, maybe you want to ease up on Patty a little."
"KIRK: But the maypole is an expertise of mine. I re-enacted the dwarf's maypole choreography from ""The Safety Dance"" video, my junior-high talent show. Chicks were falling at my feet. I'm less than impressed, Patty!"
"LORELAI: Take a break, please. I've seen Miss Patty get violent. It's not pretty. Remember that time?"
"KIRK: That's when she b*at me up."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Let's not repeat that."
"KIRK: Okay."
"[Jess sits on a nearby bench. He and Lorelai glance at each other as she passes. He looks like he's reading Punk Planet, but inside the magazine he's hiding You're Not Alone, one of the self-help books Luke gave him.]"
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN KITCHEN"
"JACKSON: They're the best I've got."
"SOOKIE: That's sad for you and the whole vegetable industry."
"JACKSON: They're the best in the state. I stand by them."
"SOOKIE: They're puny. They're tasteless."
"JACKSON: Puny? These are not puny."
"SOOKIE: If they're small enough to shove up our son's nose, they're too small!"
"JACKSON: No way could you shove one of these up Davey's nose."
"SOOKIE: Bet you five bucks."
"JACKSON: Get him in here!"
"LORELAI: [entering] Hey, guys. You probably shouldn't shove a radish up your son's nose. Just thinking out loud."
"SOOKIE: All right, I'll take these if it's all you've got."
"JACKSON: Well, don't do me any favors. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: You two are back big-time."
"SOOKIE: That actually felt good. [Chuckles] Like getting a Jack LaLanne workout."
"LORELAI: Dead or alive?"
"SOOKIE: Jack LaLanne? Dead. No -- alive. [Lorelai's phone rings] Oh, now that's gonna bug me."
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: [walking through Yale campus] There is so much joy around me, I'm gonna hurl."
"LORELAI: Hey, what's wrong?"
"RORY: You should see all the boisterous high-fiving going on all around me. It's sad. It's just really sad. Hey, do you mind, buddy?"
"LORELAI: Kids are in party mode, huh?"
"RORY: The kids are clicking their heels like there's no tomorrow. And there is no tomorrow for those who do not have a final on Saturday morning, such as me. I'm pathetic. I should stand between two of them and have them high-five my head from opposite sides and put me out of my misery."
"LORELAI: Just one more final to go, then you'll be free."
"RORY: Ahh, two more boisterous bozos just rubbing my face in it."
"LORELAI: You know, I do have one thing to run by you. Do you have the brain power?"
"RORY: I think I can swing it."
"LORELAI: It involves the ""J"" word."
"RORY: Oh, not more about Jesus. I'm sick of him and Mel Gibson."
"LORELAI: Jess."
"RORY: Oh, what about him?"
"LORELAI: He's in town for that wedding and I never know where we stand on the Jessometer. I've been seeing him. I was just wondering if you want me to tell you when I do."
"RORY: Sure."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Okay. It's just always so weird -- this ""J""-word topic of ours."
"RORY: You don't have to refer to him as ""the 'J' word."" Call him ""Jess,"" and feel free to tell me when you see him."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: I mean, if you see him eight times in one day, you don't need to call me eight different times to tell me. That's clearly overdose."
"LORELAI: Sure."
"RORY: Maybe, like, you could limit the reports to just significant sightings. If you see him a hundred yards away, disappearing around a corner, I really don't need to know that. If he comes up to you and spits in your face, report that."
"LORELAI: Permission to spit back?"
"RORY: You know what I'm saying."
"LORELAI: I know what you're saying. Hey, you know what I should do? Run up, tell him I love him, then run away really fast -- a taste of his own medicine."
"RORY: Don't do that! Don't do anything out of the ordinary."
"LORELAI: I won't. Honey, I'm kidding. [Gasps]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: There's a horse in the dining room."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Cletus is in the dining room."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: He heard about the terrific continental breakfast? I don't know. I gotta go look into this."
"RORY: Okay. Bye."
"LORELAI: Cletus, honey!"
"MICHEL: Lorelai, I need your signature on this, please."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Do you see the big-nostriled thing next to me here?"
"MICHEL: The horse?"
"LORELAI: Uh-huh, the horse."
"MICHEL: It's been here for twenty minutes."
"LORELAI: Oh. What were you doing about it?"
"MICHEL: Eh, nothing."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, nothing?"
"MICHEL: It's a giant, smelly horse. I figured someone was already taking care of it."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"SOOKIE: He's alive!"
"LORELAI: Who?"
"SOOKIE: Jack LaLanne. I just googled him. Hi, Cletus."
"LORELAI: Oh, so you already saw the horse?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah. Sure, he's been here, what, twenty, thirty minutes?"
"MICHEL: About twenty-five."
"LORELAI: New Dragonfly Inn rule -- everyone listening? Okay, if you see a horse in the inn or any other large quadruped or biped or anything that's not -- what's the word -- human, figure no one's doing anything about it and do something."
"MICHEL: Oh, fine with me."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, same here."
"MICHEL: If we had the rule before, I would have done something."
"LORELAI: Okay. Great. Thanks. Bye. [to Cletus] Come on, troublemaker."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"RORY: Hittin' the road, Glenn?"
"GLENN: Yep, and I got a hot date tonight."
"RORY: Who's the lucky girl?"
"GLENN: I'm getting back together with my girl from back home. Want to see her picture?"
"RORY: Sure. Glenn, this girl is, like, twelve years old."
"GLENN: It's her when she was little. Don't make this into something dirty! She drives and everything."
"RORY: Have a good summer, Glenn."
"TANA: Oh, Rory, perfect timing. I want you to meet somebody. This is my boyfriend, Chester Fleet."
"RORY: Oh, hi, Chester. I've heard a lot about you."
"CHESTER: You can't believe everything you hear."
"TANA: Oh, it's kind of a weird day to meet him because he lost a bet with me. And that means that for the entire day, he can only talk in clichés. It's so much fun."
"RORY: Sounds it."
"CHESTER: It's always fun till someone gets hurt."
"JANET: Hey, I'm leaving, guys. Rory, you get yourself a funky monkey?"
"RORY: What?"
"JANET: Everyone poured all the alcohol they had left into a bowl and that's what's in the cup. Tastes gross, but does the trick."
"TANA: I stashed one in the fridge for you. It was poured for me, but I'm not having one."
"CHESTER: Lips that touch wine shall never touch mine."
"TANA: So much fun!"
"JANET: Well, I guess this is goodbye. See you, Rory. Have a good one."
"RORY: Bye, Janet."
"PARIS: Janet, wait, wait! [runs into the room and hugs Janet] I hate that our little clique is breaking up. It's so the end of something."
"JANET: You off your meds, Paris?"
"PARIS: You never get emotional at goodbyes?"
"JANET: With people I like. See you."
"PARIS: Keep in touch."
"TANA: So I made a collage of photos of people in the building, and I'm having everyone sign. Will you two do me the honor?"
"RORY: Sure."
"PARIS: I'll honor you."
"TANA: Isn't it a great keepsake? There's Janet with her boyfriend and Lana with hers. That's Mark and Stacy -- they're inseparable. And, oh, there's one of you, Rory."
"RORY: That's me."
"TANA: And, um, Janet and her boyfriend again, and me with Chester."
"CHESTER: You're the apple of my eye."
"PARIS: That's getting annoying there, Chester."
"TANA: And, uh, there you are again, Rory, with...oh, that's a lamppost. Oh, here's a bunch of couples from Valentine's Day. You're not in that one. And here you are with all the cafeteria ladies. I can make you a copy of that, if you'd like."
"RORY: That's okay."
"PARIS: Rory, you've had quite the dry spell this year."
"RORY: I have not had a dry spell."
"PARIS: There's not one picture of you with a guy."
"TANA: Oh, no. No. There's one. See? That's Rory with the statue of Eli Yale."
"PARIS: People are gonna talk."
"RORY: I don't care what people say. Are people talking?"
"PARIS: Not that I've heard. You just don't get out enough."
"CHESTER: All work and no play makes Jack..."
"RORY: Say goodbye before you leave?"
"TANA: Will do."
"[Rory and Paris go into their room.]"
"RORY: Since when are you someone who defines a girl by whether or not she's with a guy? I mean, you embarrassed me in front of Tana and Chester."
"PARIS: Please. They were singing the lumberjack song at the top of their lungs. They're embarrassment-proof. [hands Rory a piece of paper] Here."
"RORY: What's this? Leonard Fleming?"
"PARIS: Asher's son. He's a terrific guy -- good looking, runs a mutual fund, newly divorced, and on the hunt."
"RORY: I don't think so."
"PARIS: The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. He is one hot apple, juicy to the core."
"RORY: I got it. Nice, hot apple."
"PARIS: I just want you to be happy."
"RORY: Please, don't feel sorry for me. I'm fine."
"PARIS: I don't want you to have a long, dry summer."
"RORY: Please stop talking about my love life."
"PARIS: Fine. Wish me a merry trip to jolly old England."
"RORY: Have a merry trip."
"PARIS: And hey, if you call Leonard and one of his kids answers, hang up. They still think Mommy's coming back."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, Mrs. Kim."
"MRS. KIM: Hello, Lorelai. What can I do for you?"
"LORELAI: Well, do you still have the big door knockers -- metal with the chipped red paint? [Mrs. Kim picks up a door knocker.] You're a magician. Do you know that? Oh, it's great. Isn't it big?"
"MRS. KIM: And good price, seeing as how it may have belonged to James Madison. It was commonly known that James Madison liked big knockers."
"LORELAI: [laughing] I bet a lot of the founding fathers liked big knockers. I'm sorry for laughing. I'd explain if I could."
"MRS. KIM: It's a double entendre. I've been in this country 20 years. I get things."
"LORELAI: I never doubted."
"MRS. KIM: It's ninety dollars."
"LORELAI: I'll take it."
"MRS. KIM: Here."
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"MRS. KIM: Mail for Lane. I know you go to Luke's, where she works. If you could pass this on to her, I would appreciate it."
"LORELAI: Mrs. Kim, hasn't this gone on long enough?"
"MRS. KIM: Not for you to say."
"LORELAI: She's your only child. I know you miss her. She misses you. Call her. See her. Don't avoid her."
"MRS. KIM: This is between me and my daughter."
"LORELAI: Well, as your mailman, I hereby resign."
"MRS. KIM: Fine. It comes to $140."
"LORELAI: You said ninety."
"MRS. KIM: Wrapping charge."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Liz and her friends sit at one of the tables laughing while Luke works on a plate of turkey legs at the counter.]"
"CARRIE: And it's not just guys -- girls are not supposed to be monogamous, either. We're h*m* sapiens, not rocks."
"LIZ: That'so unromantic."
"WOMAN 1: You can say that. You got lucky."
"WOMAN 2: Yeah, T.J. Is yum, yum."
"LIZ: I did get lucky, didn't I?"
"CARRIE: We're animals, and animals in the wild don't mate for life, except, like, tigers, but they're retarded."
"LUKE: Hey, Liz."
"CARRIE: Men are good for two things. Make that one, and the one thing they're not that good at."
"LUKE: Excuse me, sorry to break up the festivities, but do you have any idea if I'm doing this right?"
"CARRIE: Most guys don't know if they're doing it right."
"LIZ: Uh, not my expertise, bro, but they smell good, if that helps."
"LUKE: Well, there should have been an instruction book of some kind."
"LIZ: I'm so sorry this got dumped on you, but the turkey leg guy knew that going into that bar violated his parole. You can't reason with him."
"LUKE: Is this how turkey legs are supposed to look?"
"CARRIE: I don't know. Take off your pants and let us see."
"LUKE: Hey, weren't you guys going to a spa or something?"
"LIZ: Yeah, we're going, right?"
"WOMAN 2: In a minute."
"JESS: [coming into the room and speaking to Luke] I need to get some batteries. I'll be back."
"LIZ: Jess! Jess! Come over here and meet my oldest friends."
"LUKE: Watch the one on the left."
"JESS: Thanks."
"LIZ: Girls, this is Jess."
"CARRIE: Hello, handsome."
"WOMAN 1 & 2: Hi."
"JESS: Hi."
"LIZ: He's gonna walk me down the aisle. Is that cool or what?"
"JESS: It's no big deal."
"LIZ: It's a very big deal."
"[A man dressed in a delivery uniform opens the diner door.]"
"LUKE: Can I help you?"
"MAN: Got a package here."
"[Carrie and other women sit up straighter.]"
"LUKE: From who? I'm not expecting anything."
"MAN: It's a very important package."
"LUKE: But there's no address on it."
"JESS: Have fun."
"LUKE: Have fun with what?"
"MAN: This package is for Liz Danes."
"LIZ: Oh, that -- that's me."
"MAN: Do you accept delivery?"
"LIZ: I -- I guess."
"[The man starts to strip as the women cheer.]"
"CARRIE: Shake it, doll, shake it."
"LUKE: No, don't shake it in here."
"WOMAN 1: Luke, we need change!"
"WOMAN 2: Turn these twenties into ones!"
"LIZ: I don't believe this, you rats!"
"CARRIE: Earn your money for Mama!"
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Kirk is working the cash register. Jess gets in line behind Dean.]"
"KIRK: Nail polish remover -- $1.40. Ladies Speed Stick -- $2.60. Good choice on that one. Keeps you dry all day and into the night. Jasmine body lotion -- nice price on that. Might want to get a couple."
"DEAN: [to Jess] It's for my wife."
"KIRK: And, with your emery boards, it comes to $19.67."
"DEAN: Keep the change."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"EMILY: I'm so sorry you have a final tomorrow. I thought you'd be free as a bird tonight."
"RORY: Them's the breaks."
"EMILY: You could have stayed at school and studied if you had to. I hope you know that."
"LORELAI: You're playing different music."
"EMILY: Hmm?"
"LORELAI: The music -- it's different. Some chick is singing."
"EMILY: It's ""Blossom Deary."" You don't like it?"
"LORELAI: No, I like it fine. You've just never played it. You and Dad always play classical music."
"EMILY: We just thought we'd try something new tonight."
"LORELAI: We?"
"EMILY: He's out of town, but you know what I mean. We talked about changing the music. So when will you be done with your final tomorrow?"
"RORY: Around noon, depending on how fast I write."
"EMILY: Any friends left behind to keep you company -- girlfriends, boyfriends?"
"RORY: Well, my roommates are all gone, and I'd say 95% of the class has vamoosed."
"EMILY: And you don't have a boyfriend?"
"RORY: Not really."
"LORELAI: Why, do you? [on Emily's look] I'm making a joke."
"EMILY: I was just wondering. We haven't talked about your love life in a while. I get to ask sometimes, don't I?"
"RORY: Um, sure."
"LORELAI: Where'd you say Dad was?"
"RORY: [enunciating] In Philadelphia."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Mom. Philadelphia, huh? Funny, you didn't mention that to me when we talked earlier. You just said he wouldn't be here."
"EMILY: Well, what do you want, Lorelai? For his secretary to fax you his schedule?"
"LORELAI: No, I just want to be kept informed."
"EMILY: Well, a lot of his schedule these days has to do with Floyd AKA your ex-boyfriend's father. I didn't know how much detail you wanted to hear."
"LORELAI: I hear you. Blossom hears you. We're good."
"EMILY: So you'll be a free girl around noon?"
"RORY: Around then."
"EMILY: I just wanted to know because I to be thinking about you right at that moment when the weight is lifting off your shoulders."
"RORY: I'll be looking forward to it."
"EMILY: I'll be right back. I'm going to see if Kiki put the raspberry soufflés in."
"LORELAI: Dad hates raspberries."
"EMILY: No, he doesn't."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry, thought he did. Sorry."
"[Emily leaves.]"
"RORY: What is going on here?"
"LORELAI: I'm trying to get her to fess up to the separation."
"RORY: No, me! Am I cloaked in loneliness or something? Everybody has been pestering me about my love life this week."
"LORELAI: That was not about you. It was about evading my questions. It's a classic Sun Tzu ""Art of w*r"" maneuver. If you're being attacked from the east, attack whoever's to your west, and you were the west. I never read the book. It's full of crap like that."
"RORY: Well, stop attacking her so she'll stop attacking me."
"LORELAI: Well, you butted into my line of inquiry with your, ""He's in Philadelphia"" stuff. She was about ready to crack."
"RORY: She was not ready to crack. She was ready to say, ""He's in Philadelphia."""
"LORELAI: Did he sound like he was in Philadelphia when he called?"
"RORY: You mean, did I hear guys in the background saying, ""Get your Philly cheesesteak here?"""
"LORELAI: Why aren't you seeing anybody, by the way?"
"RORY: I'm gonna throw a roll at you."
"LORELAI: I just gotta know what's going on with them."
"RORY: They're having some sort of marital difficulty, Mom, and pressuring her like this is not going to help."
"LORELAI: But I'm dying here. I mean, if he's out of town, is she actually staying here instead of that hotel she checked into? Or is she staying here permanently, and he's the one who's at a hotel? Or --"
"EMILY: Well, thank God I checked or we would have been soufflé-less."
"LORELAI: Well, good, good. Gotta have that soufflé."
"EMILY: So, where were we?"
"RORY: We were all about to switch to new subjects."
"EMILY: Oh, okay."
"LORELAI: Dad hates chicken Kiev, doesn't he?"
"CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT"
"ZACH: Well, who called Groton?"
"BRIAN: I didn't."
"LANE: Me neither."
"ZACH: Someone in this room called someone in Groton at 11:37 P.M. on the 16th, and it wasn't me."
"LANE: That was the night you had those two trampy girls over, Zach."
"ZACH: They weren't trampy."
"LANE: I heard one of them call her boyfriend and brag that she had scored some sucker beer."
"ZACH: I'll pay for Groton. [Doorbell rings.] Does that doorbell run on electricity? 'Cause that's eating up money, too. We have to tell people to knock."
"LANE: [opening the door] Aunt Jun."
"JUN: I'm here on your mother's behalf. She would like to visit."
"LANE: Here?"
"JUN: A social call."
"LANE: When?"
"JUN: Here are three times she can come this week. If none are convenient, she will offer three more. If those are not good, she will rescind the offer. Does this sound reasonable?"
"LANE: Very."
"JUN: Fine."
"LANE: Is she bringing a Bible?"
"JUN: She didn't say. Here's your mail."
"LANE: Thank you. Would you like to come in?"
"JUN: No."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is playing loud music and drinking from a plastic cup as she packs.]"
"EMILY: Rory?"
"RORY: Grandma, hi."
"EMILY: You busy?"
"RORY: No, I was just packing and having a little lemonade here."
"EMILY: You're done with your final, right?"
"RORY: Yes. What are you doing here?"
"EMILY: Well, I had lunch today on campus with a friend -- Cassie Sullivan. She's with the alumni committee. Didn't I mention it last night?"
"RORY: Not that I remember."
"EMILY: Anyway, she has a son who's a freshman also -- Graham Sullivan. You haven't met him?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"EMILY: Would you like to?"
"RORY: Sure."
"EMILY: Is now okay?"
"RORY: Now?"
"EMILY: Graham! [Graham comes into the room.] Graham, this is Rory. Rory, Graham. Graham's family and ours go way back. I remember this young man in diapers. He's one of the poor unfortunates who had a Saturday final, too."
"GRAHAM: Chemistry."
"RORY: Philosophy."
"EMILY: I meant to introduce the two of you ages ago. I hate that it's last minute like this. I feel awful."
"RORY: Oh, that's okay. Don't feel bad."
"GRAHAM: [whispering to Rory] Alcohol on your breath."
"EMILY: Graham mentioned that he and his group were going out tonight to celebrate. What did you call them -- ""the Saturday orphans""?"
"GRAHAM: Yes, I did."
"EMILY: And he thought you might like to go."
"GRAHAM: Yeah."
"EMILY: Would you...like to go?"
"RORY: Um...sure."
"EMILY: Wonderful!"
"GRAHAM: I actually tried to get your grandmother to go, too, but she made up some dumb excuse."
"EMILY: You're something else, you know that? Well, I feel good about this. My orphan is an orphan no more. I'll go now. Bye, Rory."
"RORY: [mumbling as she turns her head so that Emily won't smell her breath as they hug] Bye, grandma."
"GRAHAM: Okay, well, lesson number one -- when your mom or your grandmother starts trying to pin down your specific whereabouts at a specific time and place, and she's smiling kind of weird, begin evasive maneuvers immediately."
"RORY: Got caught in that one myself."
"GRAHAM: And lesson number two -- never, ever let anybody outside of your family see you in diapers."
"RORY: You were young...I hope. [Graham starts helping Rory pack.] Oh, you don't have to do that."
"GRAHAM: Oh, I just taped up eight of my own boxes. I'm a box-taping machine. Use me."
"RORY: Oh, thank you."
"GRAHAM: So, uh, the plans for tonight -- they're pretty casual. There'll be about ten of us. You're totally welcome to come."
"RORY: I was just gonna go home, but, I don't know, maybe."
"GRAHAM: We're gonna get some food, hang out. I'll leave you my cell phone number. You got a piece of paper?"
"RORY: Um...yeah."
"GRAHAM: Great. [reads the paper] Leonard Fleming."
"RORY: Ignore that."
"GRAHAM: Maybe I'll see you later."
"RORY: Yeah."
"GRAHAM: Enjoy your lemonade."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke and Jess are dressing for Liz's wedding.]"
"LUKE: What is wrong with this shoe polish?"
"JESS: Pontius Pilate was alive when you bought it?"
"LUKE: Shoe polish goes bad?"
"JESS: It's all chunky."
"LUKE: Aah, it messed up my shoes."
"JESS: Just wipe them off. They'll be fine."
"T.J.: [coming out of the bathroom] Don't you have a full-length mirror?"
"LUKE: Don't need one."
"T.J.: You don't like looking at your bottom half? I love looking at my bottom half."
"LUKE: I look down to look at my bottom half. I don't need a mirror to do that."
"T.J.: You seem nervous."
"LUKE: I'm not nervous."
"T.J.: I don't see why you would be. I'm the one getting shackled today. Looks like old polish."
"LUKE: Yep."
"T.J.: The q*eer Eye guys are very against old polish."
"LUKE: Ohh."
"T.J.: [to Jess] He's very nervous."
"LUKE: I'm not nervous."
"JESS: Maybe it's time you put a shirt on."
"T.J.: Why, am I getting you hot?"
"JESS: I need the bathroom."
"LUKE: Just hold on."
"T.J.: I am lovin' these tights. They're fantastic. They lend support everywhere you need it, but they breathe."
"JESS: [to Luke, who is trying to choose a tie] This one."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"T.J.: Hey, Luke, I had to borrow your deodorant. I hope that's okay."
"LUKE: Ohh."
"JESS: Allow me. [throws it into the trash can]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREET"
"[Luke is standing outside his diner when Lorelai walks up to him.]"
"LORELAI: Greetings, my lord. Your lady hath arrived to be escorted forthwith."
"LUKE: That's pretty good. I didn't know you spoke Renaissance."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I'm quite fluent in Renaissance. You look nice. I'm lovin' the tie."
"LUKE: Thanks. You look beautiful."
"LORELAI: Flattery will get you everywhere, my friend. Shall we?"
"LUKE: Let's go."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN CENTER"
"LORELAI: No, really, a nice, manly wreath in your hair wouldn't work?"
"LUKE: There's no such thing as a manly wreath."
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. Julius Caesar pulled it off. He was very popular with the ladies. Cleopatra used to pull his leaves off -- very sexy."
"T.J.'S BROTHER: What's this? Surely these be time travelers from the future in such foreign, mystical garb."
"LORELAI: And who be you, kind sir?"
"T.J.'S BROTHER: T.J.'s brother. I got a patio furniture store down in Nutley. Plastic, metal, teak -- whatever you need, I can hook you up."
"LORELAI: Okay, thank you."
"LUKE: Just do me a favor. I'm gonna try to keep a happy, proud look on my face to cover the smirking and about-to-laugh-my-ass-off face just underneath. Help me achieve this."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on. They have a community of people, friends, you know, who travel together, engage in silliness, dress in costume. I think it's nice."
"CARRIE: Hi, Lucas."
"LUKE: Oh! Hi, Carrie."
"CARRIE: Is that a power suit?"
"LUKE: It's my only suit."
"CARRIE: Looks pretty powerful to me. So, um, Barry stayed home."
"LUKE: Who?"
"CARRIE: The ball and chain. I'm flying solo tonight. Save a dance for me?"
"LUKE: Uh, I don't dance."
"CARRIE: You will dance."
"LORELAI: Hey, how 'bout we work on him together? I think there's a hoofer buried deep inside there, don't you?"
"CARRIE: I guess."
"LUKE: Carrie, this is Lorelai."
"CARRIE: I know. Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"CARRIE: So, um, there's gonna be a little delay. Liz ripped her dress, and it's gonna take a while to fix it. I'm supposed to spread the message."
"LUKE: Well spread it, Car -- the message, the message. [Carrie walks away.] She makes me very uncomfortable."
"LORELAI: Poor Liz. Does she know how to fix something like that?"
"LUKE: She was never one for household k*ll."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna go see. She's at Miss Patty's?"
"LUKE: Don't leave me alone."
"LORELAI: Carrie found the guy with the codpiece. That will keep her occupied."
"LUKE: Hurry back."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, Lorelai, thank heavens. I'm so bad with wardrobe."
"LIZ: I ripped it getting up. I'm such a klutz."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, that's why I'm here. Patty, you have a sewing kit?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, yeah. Right here, sweetie."
"LIZ: I'm holding everyone up."
"LORELAI: No, no. Hey, today's your day. If anyone gets to hold things up, it's you. Relax."
"LIZ: Ohh, I'm nervous. Do I look nervous? I sound nervous."
"LORELAI: You look great. It's normal to be nervous on your wedding day."
"LIZ: This is my first wedding of mine that I've ever been sober for. I'm probably gonna remember this one."
"MISS PATTY: The ones that you remember are the ones that stick."
"LIZ: What was your wedding like? Were you this nervous?"
"LORELAI: Never been married."
"LIZ: You got a kid."
"LORELAI: Found a way around that."
"LIZ: I see. You want to get married?"
"LORELAI: Oh, now, Liz. It's inappropriate for you to propose to me on your wedding day."
"LIZ: But do you want to get married? You must want to get married."
"LORELAI: I guess so, you know, if I meet the right guy."
"LIZ: I hate being single. Ever think, if you got married today or even in the next few years, you could be married for fifty years -- for most of your life. Same with me and T.J. I could be married most of my life to him. Isn't that weird to think about?"
"LORELAI: I could be married for most of my life."
"LIZ: I don't want to screw up this marriage even more than I want some pot. That's how serious I am."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"JESS: [Jess knocks on the door as he walks in.] Are you ready? The crowd's getting restless."
"LIZ: You're getting restless. Hey, do you two know each other?"
"LORELAI:Oh, Jess and I go way back. He dated my daughter."
"LIZ: Oh, you broke her daughter's heart?"
"JESS: Ah, I, uh..."
"LORELAI: No, no, he didn't. It just didn't work out."
"LIZ: Good, 'cause I don't want him to be like his father, breaking hearts. I want him to be like T.J. Or my second husband or, like my boyfriend after my third husband, who died. They were good guys."
"LORELAI: Oh. You're all done."
"LIZ: Oh, it's perfect!"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, she's a miracle worker."
"JESS: I'm gonna go tell the others."
"LIZ: Thanks, hon! [to Lorelai] And thank you. You're gonna make a great wife some day and a great sister-in-law to some very lucky girl."
"LORELAI: Well, I hope so."
"LIZ: Now, go on, Luke's waiting. Unless my friend Carrie suffocated him with her boobs."
"LORELAI: Well, that would be festive. Here, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: Let's check your hair real quick, sweetie."
"LIZ: Oh, okay."
"[Lorelai starts to leave, then stops to look in Jess' open bag on the table. She sees a book titled You Deserve Love inside.]"
"MISS PATTY: You look absolutely beautiful."

"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN CENTER"
"LUKE: Everything okay?"
"LORELAI: Crisis averted."
"[The band starts to play.]"
"LUKE: Must be starting."
"LORELAI: Think they know any Zeppelin? [Two women dance down the aisle tossing roses.] Ooh, roses -- nice."
"LUKE: Does she remind you of someone?"
"LORELAI: Can you say Leslie Van Houten? [A jester tumbles down the aisle.] Now, that's impressive."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"T.J.: These tights, I'm telling you -- the best. I'm happy, my boys are happy, and they don't ride up. [lifts his arms] Hey...still dry. Thanks, buddy."
"LORELAI: You dried his armpits?"
"LUKE: I don't want to talk about it."
"[Two men push a cart, with Liz seated on it, up to the entrance.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I want one of those. She looks happy."
"LUKE: Yeah, she does."
"T.J.: She looks hot."
"T.J.'S BROTHER: Smokin'."
"T.J.: Don't you say that."
"[Jess walks Liz down the aisle then takes a seat in front of Luke and Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: [whispering] Where's the minister?"
"MINISTER: [strolls into the gazebo singing and strumming a guitar] As kids we shared our toys/with all the girls and boys/barrel of monkeys/your battleship sunk me/please recall the joy/Wheelo, Clue, Mousetrap/bash and spirograph/kaleidoscopes spinning/Yahtzee I'm winning/think of how we laughed/but today we share our love/today we share our love/for love is the greatest toy around/around, around"
"LUKE: [trying not to laugh] Help."
"LORELAI: Think of something not funny."
"LUKE: Can't."
"MINISTER: You may plant the ceremonial sword."
"[Together, Liz and T.J. plunge a sword into a tree stump.]"
"LORELAI: Avalanches, earthquakes..."
"LUKE: Not doin' it."
"LORELAI: Famine...and I'm out."
"MINISTER: Hello, friends. Isn't it a beautiful day? The day that Liz and T.J. share their love in front of those they love. Liz, do you want to tell T.J. how you feel?"
"LIZ: Yes. T.J."
"T.J.: Yeah?"
"LIZ: My heart just pours out to you. You have been so good to me and for me. I don't know where I'd be without you. I'd be worse off, I know that. [ Sighs ] You're something else."
"MINISTER: Nice. T.J."
"T.J.: Well, I wrote something down, but, for all the good points about tights -- and there are a lot -- they don't have pockets. So I gotta go off the cuff. I love ya. [They kiss and hug.]"
"LORELAI: Aw, that wasn't so funny."
"LUKE: Nah, that wasn't funny at all."
"CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT"
"[The doorbell rings.]"
"LANE: [nervously] Hi, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: Hello, Lane. Thank you for having me."
"LANE: You find the place okay?"
"MRS. KIM: Yes. Here. Multi-grain soy pudding. Extra chunky, the way you like it."
"LANE: I bet we'll all like it."
"MRS. KIM: We?"
"LANE: Come in, Mama. Mama, these are my roommates -- Zach and Brian."
"ZACH: Hello, Mrs. Kim."
"BRIAN: Welcome."
"LANE: There's no way I could afford a place on my own, so we live together. We share all the expenses and a bathroom. That's unfortunate, but we're starving artists, Mama. These are my bandmates. Zach, would you make us some tea?"
"ZACH: I'd be delighted."
"BRIAN: I'll get the cups."
"LANE: How about a tour? This is the living room, obviously. That's where Zach and Brian sleep."
"ZACH: A solid eight hours every night."
"LANE: This is my room. Window's broken but the landlord's on it. Kitchen, refrigerator..."
"ZACH: Would you like to pick a tea? We have a whole selection."
"BRIAN: Lapsang oolong, orange pekoe, Sleepy Time?"
"[Mrs. Kim looks panicked. She turns and runs out the door.]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN CENTER - NIGHT"
"WOMAN: Harry, they've got turkey legs!"
"LORELAI: I was born four hundred years too late. I mean, this food is amazing."
"LUKE: Here's a couple seats."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Mrs. Kim runs up to them.]"
"MRS. KIM: There were boys."
"LORELAI: What? Where?"
"MRS. KIM: At Lane's -- two boys -- one with hair."
"LORELAI: O-o-okay, you went to Lane's?"
"MRS. KIM: And the place -- broken furniture and dirt and boys and a broken window and boys --"
"LORELAI: Slow down."
"MRS. KIM: -- and a tiny fridge and guitars and boys."
"LORELAI: How many boys where there?"
"MRS. KIM: Two boys."
"LORELAI: Two boys."
"MRS. KIM: She stood in that room with two boys. I didn't stand alone in a room with two boys until I was -- I've never done that."
"LORELAI: Mrs. Kim, you know why the boys were there."
"MRS. KIM: She's dirty."
"LORELAI: She's not dirty. She was trying to be up front with you, and that's good. She could have hid them from you, and she didn't."
"MRS. KIM: I wish she did."
"LORELAI: No, you don't. I've met those boys. They're innocent. As innocent as if she was living with two girls. So think of them that way."
"MRS. KIM: What way?"
"LORELAI: Think of them as girls."
"MRS. KIM: Girls?"
"LORELAI: Girls."
"MRS. KIM: I don't like girls either."
"LORELAI: Well, you like them better than boys."
"MRS. KIM: True."
"LORELAI: And Lane is trying so hard."
"MRS. KIM: Girls."
"LORELAI: Yeah, think of them as two tall, gawky, caring, sometimes unwashed girls who are watching out for your daughter's safety."
"MRS. KIM: Girls. Girls. [walks away]"
"LUKE: Is she okay?"
"LORELAI: Um, she will be. She'll be okay. Ooh, hey, look. Jess made a friend."
"MAN: People think prison's a waste of time, but prison's the best thing that ever happened to me."
"JESS: Interesting."
"MAN: Picked up k*ll -- metal working, laundry -- that's a k*ll. Doing laundry for 600 guys -- no piece of cake."
"JESS: Great."
"MAN: Added fabric softener for cigarettes."
"LORELAI: Career guidance?"
"LUKE: He's doing better. He's gonna be okay."
"T.J.: It's like a marketing thing. Don't call 'em ""tights."" You guys don't want to wear ""tights."" Call 'em ""air pants."" Here's your slogan -- ""air pants -- the pants that breathe."" I'm telling you, we gotta get in on the ground floor of this."
"LIZ: There they are -- my two heroes. You saved the wedding."
"LORELAI: I saved nothing."
"LIZ: And you're always my hero, my big brother."
"LUKE: Congratulations, sis."
"LIZ: Wasn't Jess great? It made all the difference."
"T.J.: It wasn't like it was a hard thing to do, but he did it good."
"LIZ: [to Jess] Hey, hey, hey! You say ""goodbye"" before you leave."
"JESS: I'm just going to get more food."
"LIZ: You promise?"
"JESS: I promise."
"T.J.: Come on, let's get some chow."
"LIZ: Okay. Bye, guys."
"LORELAI: Oh, she's so happy."
"LUKE: Yeah, and he really loves tights."
"LORELAI: Oh, you want to know something weird?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: When I was at Miss Patty's, Jess was there. And he had his backpack, and it was open, and I saw this book. I thought I was seeing things."
"LUKE: A book?"
"LORELAI: Yes. It was a self-help book with some goofy title like, ""Learn to Love"" or ""How to Love When You're Unloved"" or something like that. [Luke forces a laugh.] Isn't that bizarre?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll answer for you. It is bizarre."
"LUKE: Maybe he's just trying to learn something, better himself."
"LORELAI: Have you seen this book?"
"LUKE: I know nothing about this book."
"LORELAI: Those kinds of books are idiotic."
"LUKE: Not if they help people."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you're not mocking this book, which is so pathetically mockable."
"LUKE: Maybe it's more pathetic if people don't try. And maybe he's trying. You ever think of that?"
"LORELAI: No, but --"
"LUKE: He can read whatever he wants to read. I forgot to get something to drink. You need something to drink?"
"LORELAI: I'm fine."

"JONAH: Seven free throws, man. All season -- seven. That's it."

"GRAHAM: So you only drink alone?"
"RORY: Pardon me?"

"RORY: Don't."
"GRAHAM: Okay. See you later."

"WAITRESS: A few blocks down. I wouldn't walk, though. It gets dicey at night."

"[Liz and T.J. start to dance. Lorelai walks past them on her way over to Luke.]"
"LUKE: [to court jester] Yeah, I'd love to see you juggle sometime. I'm a big fan of juggling. [to Lorelai] He, uh -- he juggles for money."
"LORELAI: You okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah, yeah."
"LORELAI: We okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I-I-I didn't mean to get so defensive."
"LORELAI: I didn't mean to make fun of Jess and what he was reading. Maybe it's good that he had it. You know, maybe -- he's trying."
"LUKE: It's okay. I mean, that book does sound pretty dorky."
"KIRK: Liz and T.J. wouldst enjoy others to join them in their modest wriggles."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, so your food's probably cold. You want to go get some more?"

"DEAN: What happened here?"
"RORY: Oh, I feel so stupid. I was on this date."
"DEAN: Oh, yeah?"
"RORY: It was a boy that Grandma saw in diapers. And she brought him over, and I tagged along on this stupid outing tonight."
"DEAN: He was in diapers?"
"RORY: No, she knew him when he was a little kid. So it was this whole big group of people, and they were all drinking in the car, smoking. And I just thought, ""These are, maybe, the last people on earth that I would want to die in a car crash with."""
"DEAN: Well, I'm glad you cut it short."
"RORY: Poor Grandma. It's not her fault. She was just thinking I was lonely, and diaper boy was nice and doing her matchmaker thing. Did I say that I feel stupid?"
"DEAN: No, that's okay. It's cool."
"RORY: And hungry. I haven't eaten since breakfast."
"DEAN: Well, then, let's eat."

"LUKE: There were a few."
"LORELAI: Uh, T.J. throwing his tights at the bachelors instead of Liz's garter? You ducked well, by the way."
"LUKE: Pure self-defense."
"LORELAI: Ooh, the choking guy being Heimliched by the court jester?"
"LUKE: That was good."
"LORELAI: Or -- or, um, the minister making out with crazy Carrie? T.J.'s brother making out with crazy Carrie? Or that last guy making out with crazy Carrie? Who was that guy?"

"JESS: Gotta get back to work."
"LUKE: Right, right. Did you say ""goodbye"" to your mom?"
"JESS: Yeah, we're good. I gave her a cellphone number that's pretty permanent. Just got it. Left it for you on the fridge."
"LUKE: Good."
"JESS: I want to pay you back... all the money."
"LUKE: You don't have to."
"JESS: I want to. And I appreciate it...everything -- the money, living here."
"LUKE: Well, it's good to hear, but I kind of knew that."
"JESS: Yeah, but, in a relationship -- any relationship -- it's important to let the other person know you appreciate them so you don't create barriers that delay any hope for reciprocation."
"LUKE: I think I read that somewhere."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"LUKE: You're hoping for reciprocation? You got it. I'm here, Jess. I'm always here."

"RORY: It's only hitting me now. My classes are done -- done. I don't have to think about Chaucer or Euclid or Kafka or Machiavelli for months. I can just think about Jane magazine and why did Uma wear that dress -- fun stuff like that."
"DEAN: You'll still think about Kafka...and probably Chaucer."
"RORY: Probably. But those other two bozos are history. You hear me? History! See in there?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"RORY: First semester poli sci."
"DEAN: Which was your seat?"
"RORY: Oh, we didn't have assigned seats, but I usually sat with my back to the window so I wouldn't get distracted."
"DEAN: This campus is huge."
"RORY: And you're seeing it at a weird time 'cause we're probably the last two people left."
"[They enter Rory's dorm.]"
"DEAN: Man, it's good to get out. It's good to laugh. I laughed tonight. You're funny."
"RORY: I can be funny."
"DEAN: That's what I just said."

"DEAN: Yeah."
"RORY: Well, thanks for saving me."
"DEAN: Yeah, anytime."

"DEAN: She thinks I'm out."
"RORY: Out where?"
"DEAN: Doesn't matter."

"RORY: What?"
"JESS: Come with me."
"RORY: Where?"
"JESS: I don't know...away!"
"RORY: Are you crazy?"
"JESS: Probably. Do it. Come with me. Don't think about it."
"RORY: I can't do that. [opens the door and walks into her room]"
"JESS: You don't think you can do it but you can. You can do whatever you want."
"RORY: It's not what I want."
"JESS: It is. I know you."
"RORY: You don't know me!"
"JESS: Look, we'll go to New York. We'll work, we'll live together, we'll be together. It's what I want. It's what you want, too."
"RORY: No!"
"JESS: I want to be with you, but not here. Not this place, not Stars Hollow. We have to start new."
"RORY: There's nothing to start!"
"JESS: You're packed. Your stuff is all in boxes. It's perfect. You're ready. And I'm ready. I'm ready for this. You can count on me now. I know you couldn't count on me before, but you can now. You can."
"RORY: No!"
"JESS: Look, you know we're supposed to be together. I knew it the first time I saw you two years ago, and you know it, too. I know you do."
"RORY: No, no, no, no, no!"
"JESS: Don't say ""no"" just to make me stop talking or make me go away. Only say ""no"" if you really don't want to be with me."
"RORY: No!"
"[Jess backs away and leaves. Rory sits down on a box and puts her head in her hands.]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE - VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING"
"[Lorelai shuffles sleepily into kitchen where Rory is busily working]"
"RORY: Oh, hi! Great! I'm still on my finals sleep schedule, and, man, am I wired. What time is it? Like, 3:00 in the morning? I cannot tell anymore. Want some mac and cheese? I love mac and cheese when I can't sleep. [She checks the refrigerator while Lorelai rubs her eyes.] Cool. Individual cheese slices. So, I've been making out my résumé so I can try to get a summer job, because there is no way that I am going to swipe cafeteria cards again next year. [Buzzer sounds in background.] My whites are done. [Rory moves to the laundry room while Lorelai rests head on the kitchen table.] Do you know that the best time to do your laundry at Yale is in the middle of the night? You have your pick of washers, the place has just been swept, and the trash is completely empty. So, what do you think? [Rory brings another clothes basket to laundry room] The Stars Hollow Gazette needs a facts checker, but Rob's Tire is offering way more money. I know that now is the time to suffer for my art, but I was so brok"
"LORELAI: Great to have you home, hon. [She shuffles off to bed as Rory rattles the doorknob.]"
"CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN LOBBY"
"MICHEL: Okay, I think I've got all the rooms assigned for the test run."
"LORELAI: Hit me."
"MICHEL: Miss Patty is in room one, Babette is in two. I put Taylor in three, the corner room. The Siegels will go in five, you and Rory are in six -"
"LORELAI: W-wait, what happened to four?"
"MICHEL: Four is taken."
"LORELAI: By whom?"
"MICHEL: By friends of mine. Sookie and Jackson are in -"
"LORELAI: Which friends of yours?"
"MICHEL: You said I could invite friends of mine, did you not?"
"LORELAI: I did."
"MICHEL: Okay, so I did that. I invited two of my friends, and I put them in room four, and now room four is taken with my friends as you suggested, okay?"
"LORELAI: Paw-paw and Chin Chin cannot come to the test run."
"MICHEL: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because they are dogs, Michel."
"MICHEL: They cannot stay home by themselves. They get lonely and they eat expensive Italian things."
"LORELAI: Then get yourself a Chow sitter, because room four is for human beings only."
"TOM: Terrific, they're on their way up. [Lorelai approaches with Michel following]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, Tom, I'm putting Post-its where we need paint touch-ups."
"TOM: Got it."
"LORELAI: And, you know, we got that test run Saturday. I was really hoping to have some doors by then."
"TOM: I told you, the doors are coming."
"LORELAI: You told me that two weeks ago."
"TOM: And I'm sure I meant it."
"LORELAI: Tom!"
"TOM: I'm calling right now."
"MICHEL: I don't understand why you get to bring Rory, and I don't get to bring my Chows."
"LORELAI: Because I'm mad with power."
"MICHEL: They are cleaner than she is. They are quieter than she is."
"LORELAI: Stop comparing your dogs to my kid."
"MICHEL: As much as you love Rory, that is how much I love Paw-paw and Chin Chin."
"LORELAI: I gave birth to her! I carried her inside me, and nine months and twenty-six hours later, she came out!"
"MICHEL: If I could have given birth to them myself, I would have, but I didn't have that choice! [They both approach Kirk loading wood into the fireplace.]"
"LORELAI: I think that's enough wood there, Kirk."
"KIRK: I put wood in all the guest rooms and the living room, so all I have to do is store the rest of the cord you bought."
"LORELAI: Okay, Michel will take you outside and show you where it goes."
"KIRK: Outside? Do you really want to expose your wood to the elements?"
"LORELAI: We'll get a tarp. Michel?"
"MICHEL: Any dogs, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Dogs urinate on wood. I hate dogs."
"[They both leave. Lorelai turns to Lulu, who is seated nearby.]"
"LORELAI: Going with Kirk on his rounds again, Lulu?"
"LULU: Uh-huh. I just love it when he looks like the Brawny paper towel guy."
"LORELAI: It is a good outfit."
"LULU: The place looks absolutely wonderful, Lorelai. When does it open?"
"LORELAI: Two weeks, but we're having a test run on Saturday -- just a bunch of friends who will hopefully still be our friends on Monday."
"LULU: Sounds wonderful."
"LORELAI: Hey, You and Kirk should come."
"LULU: Really?"
"LORELAI: Sure. I'll give you Paw-paw and Chin Chin's room. We'd love to have you."
"LULU: Wow, we would love to come. And I know Kirk would feel better being able to check up on the wood."
"LORELAI: Kirk's lucky to have found you, Lulu. [Lulu giggles.]"
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY KITCHEN"
"[Sookie bustles around the busy kitchen inspecting the workers.]"
"SOOKIE: Oh, pretty garnish! That's some good mincing there. Just enough walnut. Is that fish done? It should be done. Perfect."
"LORELAI: Ooh, man, it smells great in here."
"SOOKIE: This is the best kitchen staff I've ever had, ever! I don't know how we got them, but they're amazing! I got to show you this mincing. Seriously…"
"LORELAI: No, no, no, no. I believe you. They seem terrific. But, um, Sookie, so there are seven workers in here, and we're only budgeted for five."
"SOOKIE: I know."
"LORELAI: [ Chuckles ] That's a problem."
"SOOKIE: Yes. See, I hired seven, figuring that at least two would crap out, and then we'd have five."
"LORELAI: And?"
"SOOKIE: And none did."
"LORELAI: So what do we do?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe the test run will break a couple of them, but if no one quits, honey, you got to fire two of them."
"[Michel enters kitchen]"
"MICHEL: [Sighs] There are all sorts of chromosomes missing from that man."
"LORELAI: Put Kirk and Lulu in room four."
"MICHEL: You cut me."
"LORELAI: Okay, so is that it for the rooms?"
"MICHEL: Basically, yes. You and Rory in six, Luke in seven."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"MICHEL: Yes, Luke"
"LORELAI: Oh! So is he coming? Luke's coming?"
"MICHEL: Is he not supposed to?"
"LORELAI: No, no, of course he was. I mean, he was invited quite a while ago...before anything happened. [Michel stares dumbfounded] I mean, I didn't know he was coming, that's all. Okay, so good. Luke's in room seven. Lucky number seven. Not that it's lucky for Luke, 'cause I don't know what's lucky for Luke, okay?"
"SOOKIE: Look at how he chopped these onions. I just want to shove a string through them and wear them around my neck!"
"MICHEL: That wouldn't be at all eccentric."
"LORELAI: Oh! Oh, honey, come here. [Lorelai embraces Sookie.]"
"SOOKIE: What? [Lorelai chuckles.] What is that for?"
"LORELAI: In all the craziness, I completely forgot that today is your wedding anniversary."
"SOOKIE: Oh, my god! [dashes off]"
"CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory wakes from sleep with a Post-It stuck to her forehead. ""Lunch at Luke's"" is written on it. She sits up to find her bed filled with clean, folded laundry covering it.]"
"CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT"
"[Lane and Rory are playing video games]"
"RORY: Where'd he go?"
"LANE: I don't know."
"RORY: What do I do?"
"LANE: I don't know!"
"RORY: Did I lose?"
"LANE: Well, you have no head, so probably."
"RORY: So this is what teenage boys are doing instead of watching television?"
"LANE: Apparently."
"RORY: Seems like a lateral move."
"LANE: Hey, you hungry?"
"RORY: I'm starving."
"LANE: Well, your timing is perfect, 'cause I went to the store yesterday."
"[Lane starts pulling up floorboards.]"
"RORY: Are you kidding me? You just got away from the floorboard life."
"LANE: Boys will eat everything. I bought vanilla-almond body lotion the other day."
"RORY: No."
"LANE: On chips -- mine, by the way."
"RORY: So, Jess came by to see me."
"LANE: You've been here 20 minutes, and you drop this now?"
"RORY: He just showed up at my dorm on Saturday night."
"LANE: Why? What did he say?"
"RORY: Well -"
"LANE: Wait! [pulls out chip and poises to listen] [ Sighs ] Go."
"RORY: I got home from this awful setup."
"LANE: The guy your grandmother brought by?"
"RORY: That's the one."
"LANE: He was that bad?"
"RORY: James Spader in ""Pretty in Pink."""
"LANE: You could have just stopped at ""James Spader."""
"RORY: Anyway, I left the pub, got back to my dorm, and Jess was there."
"LANE: What did he want?"
"RORY: He wanted me to come away with him."
"LANE: Oh, my God! What did you say?"
"RORY: I said -- I don't know. It was so weird. He was just... Jess. I mean, he shows up out of no where with this crazy proposal. It was awful."
"LANE: It doesn't sound awful."
"RORY: What are you talking about? Jess bailed on me twice."
"LANE: I know, but how incredibly romantic to have this guy show up out of the blue and want to take you away with him."
"RORY: When I first met Jess, I thought, ""What could be better than this? He's smart, good taste in books and music, so cute."" But Jess is great one minute and then the next - you know, as far as I know, I could have said yes, packed my bag, and by the time I got to the car, he would have changed his mind."
"LANE: It's part of why he's cute. He's unpredictable."
"RORY: I guess. You know, when I was with Dean, I always knew that no matter what happened, he would be there."
"LANE: Dean was very dependable."
"RORY: It was more than that. He's -- well, he was so... um, I was safe, and he was so nice to me."
"LANE: He really loved you."
"RORY: I think I really blew it there, you know? I didn't appreciate it."
"LANE: Every girl has to fall for a bad boy. It's the rule. It's the reason so many accountants eventually get married."
"CUT STARS HOLLOW STREET"
"TROUBADOUR: [singing] Hey, she's a piratey soul, full of vinegar and glitter, she is a song of her own, from down the wrong end of the river, wild like the lily-a-passion, have you ever had the honors - oh, no, no, no, no, no way"
"RORY: Hi."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is sitting at table watching Luke intently. Rory enters.]"
"RORY: I can't believe you didn't wake me up."
"LORELAI: Me and what army?"
"RORY: I only have so much time off. I don't want to waste it all sleeping till noon."
"LORELAI: There was no waking you up. You were completely out of it. We're talking Farrah on ""Letterman."" Hey."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Luke is coming over here. I want you to pay very close attention."
"RORY: To what?"
"LORELAI: Shh."
"LUKE: Coffee?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure, coffee would be great. Coffee, hon? Yeah, she'll have coffee."
"LUKE: Okay. You want a minute?"
"LORELAI: Yes, a minute would be great."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Well?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You notice anything?"
"RORY: Anything?"
"LORELAI: Anything weird, anything different?"
"RORY: About Luke?"
"LORELAI: Of course about Luke. Did you notice anything different?"
"RORY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: Like a vibe, an attitude. Did he look at me differently?"
"RORY: Differently than what?"
"LORELAI: Differently than he did."
"RORY: Differently than he did when?"
"LORELAI: Before."
"RORY: Before what?"
"LORELAI: Before before. Rory!"
"RORY: How on earth can you be frustrated with me right now?"
"LORELAI: Fine. Come here."
"[Lorelai hurriedly pushes Rory out the diner door.]"
"RORY: What's your damage, Heather?"
"LORELAI: I think I'm dating Luke."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I'm not sure. It's just a possibility. I could be wrong."
"RORY: But how? When?"
"LORELAI: I went with him to his sister's wedding, and it was really nice. We had a really good time. We laughed a lot, and we ate, and then we danced."
"RORY: Danced? How?"
"LORELAI: We pop-locked."
"RORY: Was it a fast dance, slow dance, group dance?"
"LORELAI: It was a slow dance. What is ""group dance?"""
"RORY: The hustle, the hora."
"LORELAI: No hustle, no hora. It was a slow dance -- a waltz. Luke can waltz."
"RORY: Luke can waltz?!"
"LORELAI: Luke can waltz."
"RORY: Look how you just said, ""Luke can waltz."""
"LORELAI: What, I'm just saying, I'm surprised that Luke can waltz."
"RORY: That sounded more like, ""I'm surprised I still have my clothes on."""
"LORELAI: Oh, stop."
"RORY: What else happened?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. We spent the evening together. We danced, he walked me home, then he asked me to a movie. All of these things individually do not add up to dating, but together, I don't know. And there was this moment, when he walked me home, where I thought -- I don't know."
"RORY: Did you say yes?"
"LORELAI: When?"
"RORY: To the movie. Did you say yes?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: That sounds like dating to me."
"LORELAI: But maybe he didn't mean it as a date thing. Maybe he just needed to get out of the house, and since I'm currently one of the women sitting home, thinking, ""If I could only find a man like Aragorn,"" he picked me."
"RORY: Okay, whoa, this is Luke."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: Our Luke -- the town Luke. We see him every day. He's a part of our lives."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: I mean, everyone will know. They'll know if you're together, they'll know if you're not together."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: You can't just date Luke. When you're with Luke, you are with Luke. And if it doesn't work out, it will be really bad for both of us. I mean, how do you feel about this? Do you want to be dating Luke?"
"LORELAI: Okay, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I don't even know if this is what he's thinking. This could be a totally innocent situation, and then we've done all this what-iffing for nothing. Let's just go back in there and see if anything's weird, okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay. [they re-enter diner]"
"LUKE: Is everything okay?"
"LORELAI: Yes. [nonchalantly leans against their table and tumbles entire contents making lots of noise]"
"LUKE: [unphased] I'll get the broom."
"RORY: That was a little weird."
"[Rory gazes out diner window and sees Dean across street walking on sidewalk. Their eyes meet. Rory smiles and waves. Dean frowns, changes direction and walks off. Rory's smile fades]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE DINING ROOM TABLE"
"LORELAI: Two radish roses for a carrot curl?"
"RORY: Deal."
"EMILY: You're trading garnish?"
"LORELAI: Yes, but only 'cause the dinner's gross."
"EMILY: Very nice."
"LORELAI: I don't like rabbit."
"EMILY: How convenient. You're not eating rabbit."
"LORELAI: But this is rabbit sauce."
"RICHARD: It is rabbit sauce."
"EMILY: It is not rabbit sauce. Do not tell her that it's rabbit sauce."
"RICHARD: It tastes like rabbit sauce to me."
"EMILY: That just goes to show how much attention you give to meals that are prepared for you."
"LORELAI: If it isn't rabbit, then what is it?"
"EMILY: It's duck."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, where's that carrot curl?"
"RORY: I haven't seen a radish rose."
"EMILY: Never mind. Don't eat it. Sriva, come get the plates. We're done."
"RICHARD: Not everyone is done."
"EMILY: Just bring out the dessert, please. So, Rory, I was thinking maybe we should go away this summer, just you and me. You should do Europe right at least once in your life, and this seems like the perfect time."
"RORY: Oh, well, Grandma, I don't really know what I'm doing this summer yet, but that sounds really nice."
"LORELAI: And really out of the blue."
"RICHARD: I agree."
"LORELAI: Were you going mention this to me?"
"EMILY: I just did."
"LORELAI: No, before you opened the peanuts."
"EMILY: Plans aren't made, Lorelai. It was just an idea. If Rory doesn't want to go, then Rory doesn't have to go."
"RORY: Rory didn't say she didn't want to go."
"LORELAI: That's right, Rory's mother was just marveling at the ""hey, look over here"" approach to the invitation. [She notices Richard frowning and looking impatient.] You okay, dad?"
"RICHARD: I'm fine. When is dessert? I have work to do."
"EMILY: It's coming as quickly as the woman can spoon fruit over ice cream."
"RICHARD: Well, clearly, she has carpal tunnel or some other modern disease which is slowing her down."
"EMILY: If she's going too slow for you, why don't you just go into the kitchen and give her a hand?"
"LORELAI: I forgot to mention, we're doing a test run at the inn this weekend."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, We're inviting all our friends to spend the weekend, just to make sure we're ready to open."
"RICHARD: Well, that sounds sensible."
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what would be great? If the two of you came."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: For the weekend."
"EMILY: Oh."
"RICHARD: Well..."
"LORELAI: I mean, I've been working toward this goal for, my God, what is it, Rory, now, twenty years?"
"RORY: Twenty years."
"LORELAI: Twenty years, wow. So basically, this is the biggest thing that's ever happened to me in my life, except for Rory being born, and I'm sure my parents wouldn't want to miss it. I mean, unless there's some specific reason why you guys can't come, both of you together. No? Okay, good, so you'll be there. Fantastic. Isn't that great, Rory? Grandma and Grandpa are coming to the test run together."
"RICHARD: Lorelai -"
"LORELAI: Dad, seriously, you have no idea how much this means to me."
"EMILY: We wouldn't miss it for the world."
"CUT TO EXTERIOR OF ELDER GILMORE FRONT ENTRANCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory exit and move towards their vehicle.]"
"RORY: So, inviting them to stay in the inn is going to do what?"
"LORELAI: I'm not inviting them to stay in the inn. I'm inviting them to stay in the bungalow 150 feet away from the inn."
"RORY: Diabolical."
"LORELAI: I'm going to lock those two in a room, and they are either coming out reconciled or in a body bag. Believe you me, I'm fine either way."
"RORY: Well, look who died and made you Hayley Mills."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Kirk rushes in, passes Luke to the back of diner.]"
"LUKE: Hey Kirk, just sit -"
"KIRK: We need to talk."
"LUKE: Where are you going? Hey! [follows Kirk to back and into Luke's apartment] Get out of my apartment."
"KIRK: This place is small. I always pictured you in a bigger place."
"LUKE: Do me a favor and don't picture me in any place, okay, Kirk?"
"KIRK: You have nice windows, though. I don't have windows. My room at my mom's house used to be a b*mb shelter. It's very cold but great for racquetball."
"LUKE: Kirk, what do you want?"
"KIRK: I need to talk to you. You're the only one I can confide in."
"LUKE: Oh, goody."
"KIRK: Lorelai invited Lulu and me to the test run of the inn."
"LUKE: Uh-huh."
"KIRK: Lulu is very excited about the invitation. It's all she talks about -- a romantic weekend at the inn with me. [absently shuffles through Luke's mail - Luke slaps them from his hands and sets the letters aside] Anyhow, I'm a little concerned about this invitation, because Lulu and I have never spent the night together."
"LUKE: Oh well, this is not a comfortable area for me."
"KIRK: I mean, we've had sex -- lots and lots of sex."
"LUKE: And this is even more uncomfortable."
"KIRK: We just haven't actually spent the night together."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"KIRK: I have night terrors."
"LUKE: Night terrors?"
"KIRK: Basically, I freak out at beddy-bye. About an hour after I fall asleep, I wake up in panic. Everything around me seems threatening, scary, out to get me. Two nights ago, I was suddenly gripped with the overwhelming feeling that there was an assassin in my house."
"LUKE: Jeez."
"KIRK: I had to get out of the room before he got me, so I jumped out of bed and locked my pillow in the bathroom."
"LUKE: Why?"
"KIRK: Because it was a b*mb."
"LUKE: Of course."
"KIRK: After neutralizing my pillow, I ran up the stairs, climbed out the bathroom window, scaled the trellis up the side of the house, and hid on the roof…"
"LUKE: Huh."
"KIRK: Completely naked."
"LUKE: Aw, jeez!"
"KIRK: The worst part of night terrors is it always ends up with me on top of the roof completely naked or running down the street completely naked or swimming in the community-center pool completely naked. That was the time I thought I was on fire."
"LUKE: Kirk, that's terrible."
"KIRK: Well, I'm used to it now, so it's kind of second nature to me, but Lulu -"
"LUKE: Right, Lulu."
"KIRK: How is she going to take it? I mean, I could scare her or ninja-kick her and lock her up with a pillow. I think I love her, Luke, and I haven't even told her that I love her. I spelled it out in chocolate-covered Oreos once, but she was really hungry, and I'm not sure if she read it first. I can't as*ault her before I tell her I love her."
"LUKE: What do you want me to do about it?"
"KIRK: I called the Dragonfly and had them put me and Lulu in the room right next to yours. That way, if you hear anything -- screaming or Russian -- you can come in and pull me off of Lulu."
"LUKE: Oh."
"KIRK: Unless, when you come in, it looks like you shouldn't pull me off of Lulu."
"LUKE: Kirk."
"KIRK: You can use your judgment on that one."
"LUKE: Kirk, I-I don't know about this."
"KIRK: Please! This weekend means so much to her. I can't tell her we're not going."
"LUKE: [ long suffering sigh ] Fine."
"KIRK: Thank you, Luke, thank you. Remember, anything weird, just jump on in."
"LUKE: I got it, Kirk. [walks Kirk to door]"
"KIRK: Just don't touch my bottom, or I'll think you have a machete."
"LUKE: If you want this to happen, do not use the word ""bottom"" with me again, Kirk."
"KIRK: Right. See you later. Hey, Luke?"
"LUKE: What, Kirk?"
"KIRK: What kind of clothes are you bringing?"
"CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN FRONT DESK"
"SOOKIE: My kitchen staff's great -- all seven of them!"
"RORY: Hang in there, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: If only one would suck, maybe it would rub off on the rest."
"RORY: Plenty of sucking potential still out there, have some faith."
"LORELAI: [talking on walkie-talkie] Tom, where are my doors? They were supposed to be here by now."
"TOM: [voice on walkie-talkie] Yeah, I know. They took a wrong turn and headed to Woodbridge."
"LORELAI: What?"
"TOM: Relax, I'm trying to track them down."
"LORELAI: Um, Tom, guests are showing up here any second. They have no doors. People will have to get very friendly very quickly."
"TOM: I got the guy on the phone. I'll get right back to you."
"LORELAI: Tom? Tom? [Chuckles to Rory] Hey, I've changed my mind. I want to be a ballerina."
"RORY: Good timing."
"SOOKIE: Okay. So, we don't have doors, and every single person I hired is fantastic. We're doomed."
"MICHEL: [voice on walkie-talkie] The guests are arriving. I repeat, the guests are arriving."
"LORELAI: No, Michel, we still don't have doors. Is there anything you can do to stall them?"
"MICHEL: No. I'm bringing them up now."
"SOOKIE: Boy, if he was on my kitchen staff, we'd be home free by now."
"TOM: [voice on walkie-talkie] I got 'em."
"LORELAI: Doors? You got the doors?"
"TOM: They're on their way up. My guys will be standing by to get them on."
"LORELAI: Tom, I'm loving you like a two dollar whore."
"TOM: Terrific. I'll tell the wife."
"LORELAI: Okay. Everybody, the doors are on the way, guests are coming. Everybody outside to greet them. It's showtime. Let's go! Okay, everyone, remember, these people are not our friends. They are customers. Just relax, don't rush, and don't k*ll anybody."
"SOOKIE: Here they come! [three open trolleys arrive with guests]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, look at that!"
"[Indistinct conversations]"
"LORELAI: Hi, everyone. Welcome to the Dragonfly Inn."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, will you look at this place!"
"BABETTE: It's a paradise. Oh, Lorelai, the babies that are going to be conceived on this property!"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, are those horses! Babette, look at the horses."
"LORELAI: That's Cletus and Desdemona, and if anyone would like to go for a ride, Michel can set it up for you. [Taylor approaches]"
"TAYLOR: The ride up here was very dusty, Lorelai. You should warn people not to wear their white pants upon arrival."
"LORELAI: I will do that, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: So, do I bring my own bags in or…?"
"LORELAI: No, you don't. Eric, Jeremy, Sam, these bags, please."
"TAYLOR: The blue one has breakables."
"[Tom walks up]"
"TOM: Okay, they're unloading them in the back. I already sent Dean in to start putting them up."
"LORELAI: Great. Thank you, Tom."
"RORY: I'll be right back."
"LORELAI: [calls to Rory as she runs off] Make sure the keys are ready. [as Kirk and Lulu approach] Well, hey there, you two! Good to see you!"
"LULU: I am so excited to be here. Thank you so much for the invitation."
"LORELAI: You're welcome. Have a good time."
"LULU: Oh, horses. [wanders off to look closer]"
"KIRK: Is Luke here yet?"
"LORELAI: No, he's not, Kirk."
"KIRK: But he's coming, right? He'll be here before I go to sleep?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea, Kirk. Why?"
"KIRK: It's a guy thing."
"CUT TO INTERIOR OF DRAGONFLY ENTRYWAY"
"[Rory starts to climb stairs and sees Dean in the side hall carrying a door.]"
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: [Breathing heavily - sets down door] Hey. [shifts uncomfortably] I have to get this upstairs."
"RORY: Can't we talk?"
"DEAN: What about?"
"RORY: He didn't stay."
"DEAN: Yeah. I don't care."
"RORY: I told him to go. He went. He's gone."
"DEAN: Well, great."
"RORY: Why are you so mad?"
"DEAN: I'm not mad. I'm working."
"RORY: I left you three messages. You didn't answer any of them. You blew me off at Luke's today. You won't look me in the eye."
"DEAN: [ Sighs ] I have to go."
"RORY: I told him to leave."
"DEAN: You told me to leave, also."
"RORY: I told you to leave so I could tell him to leave."
"DEAN: That makes sense."
"RORY: It does make sense, Dean. I didn't ask him to come. I did ask you to come, remember?"
"DEAN: I know. I just -"
"RORY: What -- why are you so mad?"
"DEAN: I thought you were back with him or something."
"RORY: No, I'm not back with him."
"DEAN: I thought you were."
"RORY: Well, I'm not. But even if I was back with him, why would it bother you so much?"
"DEAN: I don't like him."
"RORY: Okay."
"DEAN: And I...I don't want you with him."
"RORY: Right. Because he doesn't treat me right, right?"
"DEAN: Right. [leans in a little]"
"RORY: And you wouldn't want me to be with someone who doesn't treat me right, because… you're my friend, right?"
"DEAN: Right... I'm your friend. [leans closer to Rory]"
"TOM: Dean! How we doing with those doors? [They jump apart.]"
"DEAN: W-we're doing fine, Tom. [resumes carrying door]"
"CUT TO LOBBY FRONT DESK"
"LORELAI: there you go, Freddy, you're in room nine. Just follow your door."
"[Freddy follows man carrying a door up stairs. Miss Patty approaches.]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, honey, this place is spectacular."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Patty. You're in room one. I hope you like it."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, I just know everything's going to be perfect. There is nothing that you could do that I wouldn't love."
"LORELAI: No, that is not the point here. This is a test run. We need to work out all the kinks this weekend so they don't happen again, so we're depending on your feedback, and especially your criticism."
"MISS PATTY: All right, I promise to be a pain."
"LORELAI: I appreciate that. Just follow your door to your room."
"MISS PATTY: Oh. [Chuckles - eyes light up when she sees the young man with her door] After you, sweetheart."
"[Taylor approaches]"
"TAYLOR: Well, you can count on me for my feedback, Lorelai. I promise you that. In fact, I've already got fourteen complaints written down."
"LORELAI: Oh!"
"TAYLOR: Most of them are small infractions, but it's the little things -- the details -- that distinguish the Barbra Streisands from the Roslyn Kinds."
"LORELAI: Absolutely, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I even took it upon myself to bring my own comment cards just in case you didn't think to supply them."
"LORELAI: Well, we did supply comment cards, but I'm sure yours are even better."
"TAYLOR: That was a very polite response. I'm writing that down."
"CUT TO INN ENTRY STAIRS"
"[Kirk descends stairs]"
"KIRK: Excuse me, I need some stuff taken out of my room."
"MICHEL: What stuff?"
"KIRK: The lamp, the bronze bookends, the books, the shoehorns, the sewing kit. Are the paintings bolted to the walls?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"KIRK: Well, bring some pliers in case simple yanking doesn't do it."
"MICHEL: I am not yanking the pictures off the wall."
"KIRK: Well, apparently, you've never been in love."
""

"CUT TO INN FRONT DESK"
"LORELAI: There you go, room eight. [hands keys to two men] Just follow your door. [Rory approaches] Hey, you know, this door thing is actually pretty fun."
"RORY: Michel said to fill in for him. Kirk has him taking the light bulbs out of all the sconces."
"[Emily and Richard enter from front followed by much luggage]"
"LOREALI: Oh, Mom, Dad! Look, Rory, there are your grandparents and everything they own."
"EMILY: You didn't tell us what attire was required, so I had to pack everything."
"RORY: Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa. We're so glad you could come."
"RICHARD: We're delighted to be here. May we have our key? I'm tired from the drive."
"LORELAI: It takes twenty minutes to get here."
"RICHARD: It felt longer."
"EMILY: Which way do we go, upstairs?"
"LORELAI: No, mom, you and dad aren't upstairs. You're in our nicest room. Guys, will you take my parents to room twelve? The boys will take you there."
"EMILY: Where are they going?"
"LORELAI: Just follow them, Mom."
"EMILY: They're heading outside."
"LORELAI: Yes. Your room has its own entrance for privacy."
"EMILY: Oh. Well, fine. We'll see you later, Rory."
"RORY: Bye. [Emily and Richard leave] You are the bad seed."
"LORELAI: ""I have the prettiest mother. Everybody thinks so."" [strokes Rory's cheek while speaking in odd voice]"
"[Luke enters Inn with bouquet of flowers in hand - looking around. Lorelai smoothes hair, leaves Front desk and approaches Luke]"
"LORELAI: Hey, hi. You came."
"LUKE: Sure. I RSVP'd."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: Here, these are for you -- a little congratulations. [hands Lorelai the flowers]"
"LORELAI: Oh, my God, they're beautiful. Thank you. [flustered] I was - um…well, okay, so, we should get you all, uh, checked in. And that's...over there."
"LUKE: [ Chuckles ] You okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, God, yeah. Me? I'm totally fine. [turns toward the front desk and hits face into a door as man walks by] Oh!"
"LUKE: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: [hits head again] Oh, God. Um, [Chuckles] I'm fine. No problem. [squinting in pain] Um, that was your door, so you could just follow that on up…and we'll see you at dinner. Rory? [beckons Rory to bring key]"
"LUKE: Are you sure you're okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine It's like the third time I did that today. It's a bit. . [Rory approaches and hands Luke his key] We're going to be the comedy inn. We finally found our theme. So, you got your key, and, uh, b-b-bye. [Luke exits up the stairs. Rory stares at Lorelai strangely.] I've locked you in before, and I will do it again. [Giggles and smells the flowers.]"
"CUT TO INN DINING ROOM - EVENING MEAL"
"[Indistinct conversations. Lorelai moves from table to table checking on guests]"
"LORELAI: [approaches Rory and Jackson's table] Hey, how it going?"
"RORY: It's going very well."
"JACKSON: Very, very well."
"LORELAI: [ Chuckles ] Oh, Jackson, I love the shirt."
"JACKSON: Isn't it great? It's an anniversary gift from Sookie."
"RORY: Sweet, huh?"
"LORELAI: These two kids."
"JACKSON: I got to tell you, I was completely surprised. I figured, with the test run and everything, she'd be way too busy to remember."
"LORELAI: Aw, What are you talking about, Sookie could never forget her mushroom man."
"JACKSON: I'd love her to forget that nickname though."
"RORY: The food's great, mom."
"JACKSON: Yes, it is great."
"RORY: Although I admit, I know the chef, so I'm a little biased."
"JACKSON: You're a little biased. I'm sleeping with her."
"RORY: You also grew the vegetables."
"JACKSON: Oh, I did. I can't be trusted at all. [Tom walks past]"
"LORELAI: Wow Tom, I have never seen you in a suit before!"
"TOM: Really? 'Cause I'm more a suit guy than anything else."
"LORELAI: Hmm. [leans back toward Rory] I'm going to make the rounds."
"RORY: We'll be here. [Lorelai approaches table with Babette, Luke, and Miss Patty seated. Babette and Miss Patty are wearing fluffy hotel robes, Luke stares uncomfortably at his meal]"
"LORELAI: Hi, how is everything this evening?"
"BABETTE: Oh, my god, these robes!"
"MISS PATTY: What are they made of? 'Cause I am never getting dressed again."
"LORELAI: [to Luke] How are you doing?"
"LUKE: I'm just staring at my plate."
"BABETTE: He's shy. My bathrobe slipped earlier, and his poor little heart couldn't take it."
"MISS PATTY: He's been staring at his salad ever since."
"LUKE: I like salad. [Lorelai and Luke share a glance and a smile.]"
"BABETTE: Patty, you wanna try my fish?"
"MISS PATTY: Fish has too much mercury"
"BABETTE: For this fish, you'll eat the mercury"
"MISS PATTY: Oh yeah?"
"LORELAI: [ Chuckles ] Okay, well, you two go easy on him, now."
"BABETTE: We'll try."
"[Lorelai continues to watch Luke, walking away as she crashes into a waiter.]"
"LORELAI: Oh! I'm sorry, Derek."
"DEREK: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Well, there's a debate going on about that."
"[Derek leads Kirk and Lulu toward their table. Kirk leans down to Luke]"
"KIRK: We're all set up."
"LUKE: Stop whispering in my ear, Kirk."
"KIRK: I'm just saying…"
"LUKE: You're still doing it, Kirk. [Derek seats Kirk and Lulu at Taylor's table]"
"DEREK: Can I get you anything, Mr. Doose?"
"TAYLOR: Another pen would be nice."
"DEREK: Do you have enough paper?"
"TAYLOR: Just the pen will be fine."
"DEREK: Coming right up. [leaves]"
"[Sookie approaches]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, Taylor, how is he?"
"TAYLOR: Who?"
"SOOKIE: The kid, Derek. Is he rude, slow, stupid?"
"TAYLOR: No, actually, he's been an excellent waiter all evening."
"SOOKIE: Crap. [Taylor looks puzzled]"
"CUT TO INN KITCHEN"
"LORELAI: Hey, I have no need of salad in my life ever, but this is amazing."
"SOOKIE: He's great. [dejected tone] They're all great. What happened to the disenfranchised youth of America? Where did all these worker bees come from?"
"LORELAI: Cheer up, Sookie, the food's going over like gangbusters."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"[Michel enters]"
"MICHEL: I went to check on the backup generators. Everything is fine."
"LORELAI: And the dinner's going great."
"MICHEL: Everyone's settled, the doors are up."
"SOOKIE: Everyone seems happy."
"LORELAI: They do, don't they? …This is gonna work. [They all grin]"
"[Lorelai exits kitchen toward the front lobby - sees Jason standing there]"
"LORELAI: [dumbfounded] Uh, w-what are you doing here?"
"JASON: The place looks great."
"LORELAI: Thank you. What are you doing here?"
"JASON: We need to talk."
"LORELAI: Not now we don't."
"JASON: I stayed away, I gave you space."
"LORELAI: You gave me space? We broke up."
"JASON: I didn't look at it that way. I looked at it as a cooling-off period."
"LORELAI: How very revisionist of you. Jason, I'm working."
"JASON: Ten minutes."
"LORELAI: No!"
"JASON: Lorelai, we were doing great."
"LORELAI: Until you decided to sue my father, yeah, we rocked. Thank you. Goodbye."
"JASON: I am not leaving."
"LORELAI: Jason, please, I have an inn full of people here."
"JASON: Okay, um, one room, please."
"LORELAI: What?"
"JASON: I would like a room. How much is a room?"
"LORELAI: No, no. Jason, you can't stay here. Every room is taken. Please go. I will call you on Monday."
"JASON: I can't wait until Monday. It gives you too much time to talk yourself out of trying again."
"LORELAI: First I would have to talk myself into trying again, so let's make it Tuesday."
"JASON: I'll wait till you're done."
"LORELAI: I'm not going to be done for two days."
"JASON: I'll wait till you take a break."
"LORELAI: I will not have a break for two days."
"JASON: This is a terrible job. I would like a word with your boss. Who is above you?"
"LOREALI: Jason, I can't do this."
"JASON: Lorelai, I've been sitting in my apartment for two weeks staring at a dead plant that you gave me. Now I know we can work this out. I am not leaving until we do."
"LORELAI: Oh, boy."
"JASON: Just go about your business, and when you're ready to talk, I will be here. [sits down in lobby chair - picks up book on table] Oh, look, ""Above Connecticut."" I've been looking for that."
"LORELAI: Well... [moves off through dining room, where desert and coffee is being served. ]"
"CUT TO DINING ROOM -- NIGHT"
"[Dining tables now hold board games and various guests are grouped together to play.]"
"LULU: Hey, Kirk, I'm getting tired."
"KIRK: You are?"
"LULU: Would you mind if we went to bed?"
"KIRK: Uh, no, that's fine. You're tired. So, then...[Shouting] Let's go upstairs and go to bed!"
"LULU: Okay. Good night, everyone."
"KIRK: I'm right behind you. [lingers by Luke's table and jerks head, motioning to Luke]"
"BABETTE: I think Kirk wants you to go upstairs and make love to him."
"LUKE: Will you just roll? [Babette shakes dice for Yahtzee]"
"CUT TO RORY AND TOM'S TABLE"
"[Lorelai approaches)"
"LORELAI: [ Sighs ] Hey, how's it going here?"
"TOM: She's letting me win. It's very annoying."
"RORY: How's it going with you?"
"LORELAI: Well, we locked the kitchen crew in with Michel for twenty minutes, and it backfired a little. Six of them quit, and we have to start hiring again tomorrow. When you're done, would you run home and grab some CDs? I totally forgot to have them in case one of the guests wants to play something in their room."
"RORY: Sure, no problem. Hey, you do notice that Jason's sitting in the other room, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'm handling it"
"RORY: Okay. [Lorelai exits the dining area while Luke looks on with some concern.]"
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"LORELAI: Here. [hands Jason plate of hot food]"
"JASON: What's this?"
"LORELAI: You've been sitting there all night. You must be hungry. Eat something."
"JASON: Thanks. Here, sit and have dinner with me."
"LORELAI: Oh, Jason."
"JASON: I'll feed you. It'll be adorable."
"LORELAI: How much longer are you going to stay?"
"JASON: Just long enough to fix everything that went wrong between us. Luckily, I'm currently unemployed. I have plenty of time. [Luke watches from a distance in dining room]"
"LORELAI: You're very stubborn."
"JASON: I just refuse to lose the things that are important to me. [Lorelai sighs.]"
"CUT TO DINING AREA"
"[Babette rolls dice. Luke watches the activity in the lobby, oblivious to the game action]"
"BABETTE: Full house! Oh, my God, I'm kicking your ass!"
"LUKE: Hey, Babette, who's that?"
"BABETTE: Who's what? Oh, that's Jason Stiles. He was Lorelai's boyfriend for the last six months."
"LUKE: Oh, yeah?"
"BABETTE: Yeah. Not exactly who I pictured her with, but he does have a very nice car. Anyhow, they were hiding their relationship from her parents, 'cause Jason was her father's business partner. Well, of course, the parents found out about it, and all hell broke loose. Jason wound up suing Lorelai's father."
"LUKE: They still together?"
"BABETTE: I don't know. I thought they broke up, but he's here, so maybe. I could ask Patty for you if you want. Sometimes she gets the news first, 'cause her phone line picks up other people's conversations -- something about proximity to the power lines. I'll tell ya, location, location, location. [Luke continues to watch Lorelai and Jason]"
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"LORELAI: I have to get back to work."
"JASON: Go, work. I'm fine. I'm comfortable. I have food, Sookie brought me wine, and I've moved on to ""Gnomes of the West."""
"LORELAI: I'll have someone bring you out some dessert. [Lorelai walks toward front desk]"
"[Emily barges into lobby]"
"EMILY: Lorelai Gilmore, why would you do that?!"
"LORELAI: Do what?"
"EMILY: You stuck your father and me out in that Godforsaken cabin!"
"LORELAI: It's the honeymoon suite."
"EMILY: One room, no access to the main building, pitch-black at night."
"LORELAI: It's romantic."
"EMILY: No television, no radio."
"LORELAI: Actually there is a television. It's in the cabinet behind--"
"EMILY: And then the room service."
"LORELAI: Roast beef and champagne."
"EMILY: The one chance to get out of there, away from each other, and you yank it away!"
"LORELAI: Why would you want to get away from each other, Mom? Are you and Dad fighting?"
"EMILY: Stop it! You know! You know your father and I are separated, and you brought us out here and stuck us in the woods to stare at each other for 48 hours!"
"LORELAI: What was I supposed to do? You weren't saying anything, Dad wasn't saying anything."
"EMILY: Of all the cruel, insensitive -"
"LORELAI: How was I supposed to know I was supposed to know?"
"EMILY: You did know!"
"LORELAI: But you didn't want me to know."
"EMILY: Of course I didn't want you to know."
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"EMILY: Exactly what?"
"LORELAI: You didn't want me to know, so I didn't know, and now you're mad I didn't know?"
"EMILY: Because you did know!"
"LORELAI: But I wasn't supposed to know, so I acted like I didn't know!"
"EMILY: And then you forced your father and me to come here tonight under pretense of family obligation."
"LORELAI: Well, hello, that's the Gilmore way."
"EMILY: I won't stay out in that cabin one more second. I demand a room in here."
"LORELAI: We don't have any rooms in here, Mom. They're all taken."
"EMILY: Then bump someone."
"LORELAI: Can't you and Dad just talk about it?"
"EMILY: No, you stop it right now! This is none of your business."
"LORELAI: What happened? Was it Floyd's lawsuit?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, just give me a room."
"LORELAI: I don't have a room, Mom."
"EMILY: You don't have a room for your mother?"
"LORELAI: I have a room for my mother. It's the room my mother's in."
"EMILY: That's not a room. That's a practical joke."
"LORELAI: No, it was a chance for you and Dad to do something special."
"EMILY: Fine. If you won't find me another room, then I'll just sit in there until tomorrow. [She walks into seating area of the lobby.] Jason."
"JASON: Emily."
"EMILY: Do you have a room?"
"LORELAI: No, Mom, he doesn't. He just showed up here, because, apparently, it's Blake Edwards night at the dragonfly."
"[Richard enters.]"
"RICHARD: Emily. [sees Jason] Jason?"
"JASON: Richard."
"EMILY: He has a room."
"RICHARD: Are you trying to k*ll us?"
"LORELAI: [exasperated] Oh, my god."
"RICHARD: I packed our things. I think it's time to go. [Emily leaves.] I hope you've had your fun."
"LOREALI: Oh, yeah, it's been a blast."
"JASON: Can I get their room? [Lorelai narrows her eyes and leaves.]"
"CUT TO LORELAI AND RORY'S HOUSE - BACK KITCHEN DOOR"
"[Rory opens back door]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: How'd you know I was here?"
"DEAN: Your mom said she sent you on an errand."
"RORY: Ah, you went right to the source."
"DEAN: [ Chuckles ] Can I -"
"RORY: Sure."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"RORY: I'm just trying to find some CDs for the Dragonfly."
"DEAN: I hear Taylor's a big hip-hop fan."
"RORY: Oh, he hops with the hippest of them."
"CUT TO RORY'S ROOM"
"DEAN: Your room looks the same."
"RORY: Yeah, I tried that whole French revival thing, but it didn't really work for me."
"DEAN: So, um, is it weird being back at home after being away for a while?"
"RORY: No, it feels completely normal."
"DEAN: So, um [Chuckles] Today..."
"RORY: Yes, today."
"DEAN: An interesting day."
"RORY: I'd authorize a case study if I could."
"DEAN: You know, I could be wrong, but somehow I had a feeling that maybe if Tom hadn't have come in when he did -"
"RORY: Dean?"
"DEAN: Yeah?"
"RORY: Lindsay."
"DEAN: It's not working with Lindsay. I can't make it work. I've tried."
"RORY: Are you sure? Because I've heard that the first two years of marriage are the hardest."
"DEAN: We're not happy. She's not happy, and I can't make her happy."
"RORY: I can't imagine that."
"DEAN: It was a mistake, and I know that now. From the very beginning, it wasn't -"
"RORY: Wasn't what?"
"DEAN: It wasn't..."
"RORY: Maybe you could, um, go see a counselor or go away together."
"DEAN: No, it's just -- it's over. We both feel it. I know we both feel it."
"RORY: You and Lindsay?"
"DEAN: Yeah, me and Lindsay."
"RORY: You both feel it's over?"
"DEAN: I tried. We tried."
"RORY: Well, if it's over, I'm sorry."
"DEAN: You are?"
"RORY: I'm sorry you're not happy."
"DEAN: I'll be happy again. Things happen for a reason, right? [moves closer]"
"RORY: Right. I can't believe this is -- that we're... [moving closer]"
"DEAN: I can… [They kiss. Dean slowly lowers Rory to her bed.]"
"CUT TO INN LOBBY"
"[Luke enters from dining area - all is deserted except for Luke and Jason.]"
"LUKE: Hey. How you doing? [approaches]"
"JASON: Good."
"LUKE: Good. Luke Danes. [offers hand shake]"
"JASON: Jason Stiles. [takes Luke's hand]"
"LUKE: So, I see you had the pot roast. [sits down in chair next to Jason]"
"JASON: Yeah."
"LUKE: Good, huh?"
"JASON: Yeah, very good."
"LUKE: All the food was great tonight. So, Jason Stiles, Jason Stiles. I'll tell ya, that name is familiar."
"JASON: I'm a friend of Lorelai's."
"LUKE: Yeah, me too. I own the diner in town."
"JASON: Yeah, she's mentioned you."
"LUKE: Has she? Well, it's nice to be mentioned. [chuckles ] So, uh, [clears throat] you know Lorelai from where?"
"JASON: Actually, we're dating."
"LUKE: You're dating?"
"JASON: Going on six months."
"LUKE: You're dating now?"
"JASON: Yeah."
"LUKE: Oh sorry, my mistake. I thought you two had, uh -"
"JASON: well, we hit a rough patch, but we're working through it."
"LUKE: Well, good for you."
"JASON: when it's right, it's right, and Lorelai and I are right."
"LUKE: That's great. I'm very happy for you."
"JASON: Thanks. Hey, you have any idea where the men's room is?"
"LUKE: It's back through the dining room."
"JASON: Thanks, it was nice meeting you."
"LUKE: Sure, you too."
"[Luke sits and stews on their conversation. He finally shakes head and rises. Lorelai enters.]"
"LORELAI: Hey. The last one up?"
"LUKE: No, not the last one."
"LORELAI: [ Chuckles ] You okay? I heard Babette was kicking your butt at Yahtzee."
"LUKE: Actually, I'm feeling pretty stupid right now."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: I'm not a mysterious man, am I?"
"LORELAI: Well, the wardrobe's a bit of a head scratcher."
"LUKE: I think I've been very, very clear with my intentions -"
"LORELAI: Your…"
"LUKE: You know, the wedding, the movie invite, the flowers."
"LORELAI: [ Chuckles ] Luke -"
"LUKE: You knew what I was doing!"
"LORELAI: Well, no, not officially."
"LUKE: Not officially? Oh, come on. I mean, I didn't have a ref present, but other than that."
"LORELAI: Well, you didn't say anything official."
"LUKE: What was I supposed to say? I did things. I let my actions speak. That's what you're supposed to do. Your supposed to let your actions speak. That's the romantic way to do this, damn it."
"LORELAI: Okay, you're right. I'm sorry."
"LUKE: And you went along with all of it. So naturally, I assumed we were on the same page, and then your boyfriend shows up here at the inn that I invested in."
"[Lorelai reacts]"
"LORELAI: Whoa, what boyfriend? Are you talking about Jason?"
"LUKE: No, Tom. Yes, Jason."
"LORELAI: You guys were talking? What did he say?"
"LUKE: He said you were together. I mean, I was sitting there listening to this guy spout on and on about how it's right, you're right, he's right. The whole time, I'm thinking, ""What the hell have I been doing all this for? She's taken."" [Storms out the front door - Lorelai follows]"
"LORELAI: I -- I'm not taken! We broke up!"
"LUKE: Well, he doesn't know that!"
"LORELAI: Well, just calm down!"
"LUKE: Aw, I don't want to calm down! I did everything right! I did exactly what the book said!"
"LORELAI: The book?!"
"LUKE: I thought we were on track, and now you're standing there looking at me like I'm crazy."
"LORELAI: I'm not looking at you like you're crazy!"
"LUKE: You know the last time I bought flowers for someone? Never! That's when! Very easy stat to remember!"
"LORELAI: I loved the flowers!"
"LUKE: And then when I walked you home after the wedding, there was a moment. I thought there was a moment."
"LORELAI: There was! There was a moment. [Luke gazes at Lorelai, then moves closer.]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"LUKE: Will you just stand still?"
"[He gathers her in his arms and they kiss. Lorelai pulls away then moves back closer to Luke.]"
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Will you just stand still?"
"[She holds his face as she kisses him. Luke's arms wrap around her as they kiss. She pulls away again. As they gaze at each other, Luke grasps her waist and pulls her back.]"
"KIRK: Aaaaah! [running down stairs, buck naked with only a pillow covering himself.] Aaah! Aaaah! [runs out the door in terror into the night] Aaaaah! Aaaah!"
"LUKE: I'll be right back. [Lorelai looks puzzled] I'll explain later. [runs after Kirk]"
"KIRK: Aaah! Aaah!"
"CUT TO LORELAI AND RORY'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai enters front door running up the stairs]"
"LORELAI: Rory! Oh, my God. You're missing everything. [runs up the stairs] Grab those CDs and head back to the inn before you miss the cross-dressing midgets. That's where the night is headed. Oh! Things are happening -- big things, wow things. I have so much to tell you. [descends the stairs with box of Band-aids] Let me just open with this little tidbit -- Kirk running naked through the square. Of course, with all my careful planning and preparation, I forgot to bring Band-aids and a camera. I have got to learn that, always, without fail, Kirk equals camera. [sees Rory standing alone in kitchen] Hey, what's going on?"
"RORY: Dean came over to borrow something. [Dean exits Rory's bedroom to join her in kitchen]"
"DEAN: Yeah. [ Clears throat ] Thanks."
"RORY: You're welcome."
"DEAN: So, um, I should go. Um...bye, Lorelai."
"RORY: Bye, Dean. [the door closes] So, I'm almost done getting the CDs together. I picked a wide selection so we'd have choices, and then I picked a bunch that probably only you will like, but it's good to have options."
"LORELAI: [sighs and looks at Rory's rumpled bed] So, what did he borrow?"
"RORY: I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about it first. I know I promised I would, but I swear, I didn't know that this was going to happen. I mean, I didn't know he was going to show up tonight, and it just happened. It's awful for you to find out like this, I know, but everything's okay. I'm okay, and we were, you know, safe. So all those Trojan man jokes all these years really apparently stuck. And I'm lucky, too, because Dean, he's -- well, aren't you glad that it happened with someone who's good and really loves me?"
"LORELAI: But he's married."
"RORY: You don't understand the situation."
"LORELAI: Is he still married?"
"RORY: Yes, but -"
"LORELAI: Then I understand the situation."
"RORY: It's not working out between them. They're not happy."
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory."
"RORY: He tried the best he could, but it didn't work. It's over."
"LORELAI: [ Sighs ] He told you that?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: He told you he's leaving her?"
"RORY: Well -"
"LORELAI: He told you he's moving out, they're getting divorced, he's got a lawyer, they've divided up the monster-truck season tickets?"
"RORY: We didn't get around to discussing everything."
"LORELAI: You didn't get around to discussing everything?"
"RORY: It was a crazy night."
"LORELAI: You, of all people -- the girl who thinks everything through, the list maker -- you didn't bother to discuss those things before jumping into bed with a married guy?"
"RORY: He's not a married guy. He's Dean -- my Dean."
"LORELAI: He's not your Dean. He's Lindsay's Dean. You're the other woman."
"RORY: I told you, it's over."
"LORELAI: It's not over until he's out of the house with the ring off."
"RORY: He took the ring off."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God, I don't believe this."
"RORY: He's in love with me, not Lindsay."
"LORELAI: Does Lindsay know that?"
"RORY: She's not good for him, okay? She lets him quit school and work himself to death and -"
"LORELAI: No, Rory, uh-uh, you can't be one of those girls who blames the wife for forcing the husband to cheat."
"RORY: He wasn't cheating."
"LORELAI: He was cheating, Rory. He was cheating, and you were cheating with him. There's no other way to spin that, kid."
"RORY: I'm not spinning it, and I'm not a kid. I'm 19."
"LORELAI: This is your first time. It's just not the way your first time was supposed to be."
"RORY: Oh, and how was my first time supposed to be?"
"LORELAI: Well, first of all, it was supposed to be in a retirement home. And secondly, ideally, it was supposed to be with someone single."
"RORY: My first time was with someone sweet and kind who loves me."
"LORELAI: I didn't raise you to be like this. I didn't raise you to be the kind of girl who sleeps with someone else's husband."
"RORY: You slept with dad when he was with Sherry."
"LORELAI: He wasn't married to Sherry."
"RORY: He was engaged, and she was pregnant."
"LORELAI: So, this is all my fault? I set one crappy example for you, and you have no choice but to follow in my footsteps? [Rory turns and walks away.] Rory, what are you going to do now? Huh? Is there a plan?"
"RORY: I don't want to talk about it anymore."
"LORELAI: I just want what's best for you, that's all!"
"RORY: I don't want to talk about it!"
"LOREALI: I just don't want you to get hurt, Rory. What if he doesn't leave her? Now you're all emotionally involved."
"RORY: You're just mad because I didn't come running to you to discuss whether or not I was ready for this step. I decided it on my own."
"LOREALI: Well, obviously, you weren't ready for this step. The very fact that you chose another girl's guy to sleep with proves that!"
"RORY: He was my boyfriend first!"
"LOREALI: But you dumped him! You rejected him! You picked someone else!"
"RORY: Stop it! [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Rory!"
"RORY: I hate you for ruining this for me! [Walks out front door and pulls on sweater. Dials a number on her cell phone]"
"LINDSAY: [answering phone] Hello? Hello? Hello?"
"[Rory hangs up and sinks to her knees. Lorelai exits the front door and watches her daughter sobbing on the front lawn.]"
