"[OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW]"
"[Camera pans around the center of town, which is covered in yellow daisies. Lorelai and Rory are crossing the street.]"
"RORY: You should get married in Italy."
"LORELAI: All the way from home, same topic. There's tons of stuff going on in the world. Big stuff."
"RORY: Like?"
"LORELAI: Balkans."
"RORY: That was ages ago. Read a paper."
"LORELAI: Ugh. They make my hands black."
"RORY: Oh! You should walk down the aisle to Frank Sinatra with a huge bouquet of something that smells really good."
"LORELAI: Pot Roast."
"RORY: And you should wear a long veil with your hair up."
"LORELAI: Ugh, I'll take any other subject in the world for two hundred Alex."
"RORY: Why don't you want to think about this?"
"LORELAI: Because I haven't made my mind up about the yes or no part, so I don't want to start fantasizing about dresses and flowers or doves and tulle until I do, so please change the subject."
"RORY: I think the bridesmaids should be able to pick their own dresses."
"LORELAI: You know how on All in the Family when Edith would be yapping about something and Archie would pretend to make a noose and hang himself or sh**t himself in the head?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Something about this moment just made me think of that."
"RORY: Fine, I'm done. I'm taking these to Lane."
"LORELAI: Okay. Meet me at Luke's."
"RORY: Oh, get me a paper please."
"LORELAI: But my hands!"
"[OPENING CREDITS]"
"[CUT TO LANE'S HOUSE]"
"[Rory walks in carrying flowers as Lane is arguing with her mother.]"
"MRS. KIM: No!"
"LANE: A time frame?"
"MRS. KIM: No, no more talking."
"LANE: But Mama, please just tell me!"
"MRS. KIM: It's not for you to think about. All under control."
"LANE: Just give me a hint."
"MRS. KIM: Children will know what their parents think they can handle."
"LANE: I'm sorry, was that the hint?"
"MRS. KIM: I have to work. [walks away]"
"RORY: Hey, I came to bring you some of my mom's flowers."
"LANE: Thanks."
"RORY: Are you okay?"
"LANE: No, I'm not okay."
"RORY: What's wrong? Did she find your CD burner?"
"LANE: My mother and father are sending me to Korea for the summer to visit my cousins."
"RORY: So?"
"LANE: They're sending me to Korea and they won't tell me when I'm coming back."
"RORY: What do you mean they won't tell you when you're coming back?"
"LANE: I mean, they bought me a one way ticket. One way! The plane goes there and stops!"
"RORY: Are you sure?"
"LANE: I called the airline to confirm it, and my parents were in their room whispering all morning. And when my mother came out, she looked very happy. She was humming. I swear, they're planning to send me Korea for the rest of my life."
"RORY: Lane, come on."
"LANE: It's gonna be just like that Sally Field movie when her husband took them to Iran and wouldn't let them come back, except that I won't have to keep my head covered."
"RORY: Okay, calm down."
"LANE: Calm down? Are you listening? I am being shipped off to Korea!"
"RORY: Yes, I think you're freaking out a little prematurely."
"LANE: Oh really?"
"RORY: Yes, I mean, let's think about this. Maybe there's some deal with the airline and that's why the ticket's one way. Or maybe they haven't worked out the plans with your cousins yet. Or there's a weather consideration or a holiday you don't know about or. . .Wow, I'm really gonna miss you."
"MRS. KIM: [calls] Lane, come here please!"
"LANE: I have to go. You've been a good friend."
"[CUT TO NEWSSTAND]"
"LORELAI: Hey Bootsy."
"BOOTSY: So, apparently they sh**t a gland from a pig's head in Ivana Trump's read end twice a month to keep her looking young."
"LORELAI: Wow, hope she's not Kosher."
"BOOTSY: I don't know, doesn't say here."
"[Lorelai buys a paper, then stops to stare at the bridal magazines]"
"BOOTSY: Hey."
"LORELAI: [startled] Hey, what, nothing, what. . .pas?"
"BOOTSY: You a Leo?"
"LORELAI: No."
"BOOTSY: Thank God. Those guys are screwed this week."
"[Lorelai takes one of the Bridal Magazines, starts flipping through it]"
"RORY: What'cha reading?"
"LORELAI: Oh God, do not sneak up on a person like that."
"RORY: InStyle Weddings. Very interesting."
"LORELAI: No, not very interesting."
"RORY: Get any ideas?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we should have cake more often."
"RORY: Hey Bootsy, I'll take this."
"LORELAI: Oh, no. I just. . .don't. . ."
"BOOTSY: It's six bucks."
"MISS PATTY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Oh geez."
"MISS PATTY: So."
"LORELAI: Hi Patty."
"MISS PATTY: InStyle Weddings! You said yes!"
"LORELAI: Oh no, not yet!"
"MISS PATTY: Yet! She said yet!"
"RORY: I know!"
"LORELAI: I'm right here."
"MISS PATTY: He's a good man?"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, he's a great man."
"MISS PATTY: Oh I love this! I just love this! Have you told Luke?"
"LORELAI: Well, no, it just happened last night. Oh Patty, stop it. I'll tell him. It's not that big a deal if he just finds out."
"MISS PATTY: Well, whatever you say."
"LORELAI: Well, uh, it just so happens we are on our way over there now to have some breakfast, and I'll tell Luke them."
"MISS PATTY: Be gentle."
"LORELAI: Patty, me and Luke are just friends."
"MISS PATTY: Just friends. Yes, yes, I know."
"LORELAI: It's true."
"RORY: Okay lets go."
"[Lorelai and Rory start walking towards Luke's. A group of townspeople follow them.]"
"LORELAI: Well it is."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: What is with this place? Why will nobody believe me?"
"RORY: They believe you."
"LORELAI: No they don't."
"RORY: I promise they believe you."
"LORELAI: You are pacifying me."
"RORY: Just a little."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't like it"
"RORY: I'll see if I can stop."
"[They turn around and see all the townspeople behind them.]"
"LORELAI: I can't wait for the movie theater to reopen."
"[CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER]"
"[Lorelai and Rory sit down. The townspeople press themselves up against the windows.]"
"LORELAI: Hmm. Let's see, what looks good. I'm so unbelievably hungry I'm gonna have to order breakfast and lunch, crazy huh?"
"RORY: Mom, go tell him."
"LORELAI: I will."
"RORY: Now."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because in five minutes somebody's about to be pushed through that window."
"LORELAI: This is crazy. Why is everybody making such a big deal about this?"
"RORY: Because everyone knows that Luke has a thing for you."
"LORELAI: Luke does not have a thing for me."
"RORY: Tell him."
"LORELAI: Uh, we can barely get through a single conversation without biting each other's heads off."
"RORY: Tell him."
"LORELAI: Everything about me repulses that man. My coffee drinking, my eating habits. Remember when I called him Ranger Bob last week, he hated that!"
"RORY: Will you get me a muffin when you're up there?"
"LORELAI: Okay. God. Fine. [walks over to Luke at the counter] Hey."
"LUKE: Fresh coffee will be ready in a minute unless you wanna just roll up a dollar bill and go nuts."
"LORELAI: No thanks, I can wait."
"LUKE: [sees the people in the window] What the hell's going on with them?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know."
"LUKE: Crazy people. Whole town should be medicated and put in a rec room with ping pong tables and hand puppets. What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. I. . . well, I have something to tell you. No I have something to share with you actually."
"LUKE: To share with me."
"LORELAI: Yes, 'cause when exciting things happen in your life, you want to share them with the people in your life who you think will find them exciting, which I think you will."
"LUKE: What is it?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's very. . ."
"LUKE: Exciting, I've heard. I'm all prepared to jump up and down if necessary."
"LORELAI: Okay, here it is. Um, Max has asked me to marry him."
"LUKE: Yeah, I figured."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"LUKE: Well, it was obvious. You know, you too were getting kind of close. He was around a lot. Then last night with that life changing thing comment, you know, I put two and two together and figured it out."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: Congratulations by the way."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: You set a date?"
"LORELAI: No, I haven't answered him yet."
"LUKE: You're gonna say yes."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"LUKE: Well, you're making a big deal about telling me he proposed."
"LORELAI: Uh, I don't think I'm making a big deal."
"LUKE: And you wouldn't do that if you weren't gonna say yes."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm sharing something with you. Sharing is not making a big deal, sharing is a nice gesture. Like when you're a kid and you have one of those popsicles and you break it in two and offer half to another kid. That is sharing, that is what I'm doing."
"LUKE: You offered me half a popsicle?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Okay, so now you know."
"LUKE: Now I know."
"LORELAI: Uh, I guess I'll just have two blueberry muffins and some coffee."
"LUKE: Coming right up."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: You know, I think it's good you're doing this."
"LORELAI: You do? Good, me too. I mean, not that I'm definitely doing it, but if I do, then it'll be good."
"LUKE: Where you gonna live?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Here? Hartford?"
"LORELAI: Here. I don't know, we haven't talked about it actually."
"LUKE: Hartford's probably good, closer to Rory's school."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I guess."
"LUKE: Of course, it is a little far from the inn."
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah."
"LUKE: But who knows how long you'll work after you're married."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"LUKE: Oh, but you probably already talked about that, right?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no, but I do think he and my father have come to an agreement on how many goats I'm worth."
"LUKE: Hey, I'm just talking here. It's great, really. You gonna have more kids?"
"LORELAI: Hi, personal."
"LUKE: I mean, he wants kids right?"
"LORELAI: In the world? Yes, he wants kids."
"LUKE: You haven't talked about that either."
"LORELAI: Okay, you know, what we have and have not discussed is none of your business."
"LUKE: Joint checking accounts?"
"LORELAI: Luke!"
"LUKE: You do know his last name don't you?"
"LORELAI: I want my popsicle back."
"LUKE: Fine, it's your business."
"ORELAI: Yes it is. It's my business."
"LUKE: Hey, some people go their entire lives without having these kinds of conversations. My parents didn't discuss a damn thing my entire childhood. Worked fine for them. Of course, when my mom died she had to tell my dad where the coupon drawer was. Took him ten years to find it. Used a coffee can the whole time."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: I don't care what anybody says, a coupon can is not as good as a coupon drawer."
"LORELAI: How are those muffins coming?"
"LUKE: But you know what, you might like a coupon can. You never know. Here you go. Two blueberry muffins."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: And congratulations again."
"[Lorelai walks back to the table.]"
"LORELAI: Now what's going on?"
"RORY: Kirk passed out."
"LORELAI: Here's your muffin."
"RORY: Thanks. How'd he take it?"
"LORELAI: Fine, he took it fine."
"[CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE]"
"[Rory and Lorelai pull up out front]"
"RORY: Are you okay?"
"LORELAI: Fine, I'm just tied to the emergency break."
"RORY: How did you do that?"
"LORELAI: With a flourish and a big ending. Okay, I got it. Let's go. Oh, my coat."
"RORY: It's pretty warm out for a coat."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, it tends to cool off the minute I get in that house."
"RORY: You good?"
"LORELAI: I'm good. My keys."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: They're in the ignition. Okay, I got 'em. Let's go."
"RORY: What is wrong with you?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"RORY: You got lost coming here."
"LORELAI: I took a wrong turn."
"RORY: Six times."
"LORELAI: Well, my self preservational instincts at work ladies and gentlemen."
"RORY: And then the coat and the keys and the . . ."
"LORELAI: I got stuff on my mind."
"RORY: Max stuff?"
"LORELAI: No, stuff stuff."
"RORY: You're lying."
"LORELAI: I'm being mysterious. That's what women do."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Oh look, doorbell. Pretty sound."
"RORY: You know, you always make me tell you what I'm thinking."
"LORELAI: Yes, and the lesson we have learned from that is you should never become a spy."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"EMILY: You're here. Richard, they're here."
"RICHARD: [from another room] Wonderful!"
"EMILY: Come in, come in, come in."
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because you're scaring Rory."
"EMILY: Oh stop that. Get in here. Scaring Rory, you're so silly sometimes. Let's get you a drink. Put your coat down. Oh, and are you hungry? I had Antonia make some Roqueford puffs. Antonia, bring the puffs! Come, sit down, sit down. Richard!"
"RICHARD: Say nothing until I get there."
"EMILY: Well, hurry up!"
"LORELAI: Mom, what's going on? Ooh, the nails, the nails, the nails."
"EMILY: So, tell me what's new with you girls."
"LORELAI: Uh, nothing."
"RORY: Hey Grandma, what about you? Did something special happen?"
"EMILY: Well, as a matter of fact. Oh for goodness sake. Richard, dammit!"
"LORELAI: Mom, why don't you just tell us what's happening now?"
"EMILY: Oh, all right. I can't wait for your grandfather any longer. Well, you know I'm very good friends with Bitty Charleston, the headmaster's wife."
"LORELAI: Mm Hmm."
"EMILY: Well, we had this little arrangement where she keeps me aprised of all the goings on at Chilton. You know, she tells me all the gossip on the students and their parents, and any piece of information I might find useful. Well, this afternoon she called to tell me the class list just came out, and Rory has finished in the top three percent!"
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: You do? Well, who do you know at Chilton?"
"LORELAI: Um, Rory."
"EMILY: Oh."
"RORY: It wasn't definite, but I had a pretty good idea."
"[Richard walks in]"
"RICHARD: Rory, wonderful news. You finished in the top three percent of your class."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, Dad, J. Edgar Hoover over here was just telling us."
"RICHARD: What? I told you not to say anything before I got here."
"EMILY: Well, you took too long."
"LORELAI: No, no, we already knew."
"RICHARD: It's a simple request."
"EMILY: Just hang up the phone."
"LORELAI: Okay, good news either way. Let's all agree on that."
"RICHARD: I am immensely proud of you Rory."
"EMILY: Yes, we knew you could do it."
"RICHARD: Oh, we certainly did."
"EMILY: We have to celebrate. Next week we will have a special dinner."
"RORY: Grandma, all of your dinners are special."
"EMILY: Well, this one will be extra special. We'll make all your favorite foods, and you can invite some of your friends."
"RICHARD: There's an excellent chance that presents might be involved."
"RORY: You guys do not have to do this."
"RICHARD: For the top three percent?"
"EMILY: We most certainly do."
"RICHARD: You start late, have to catch up, and by the end of the year, you've overtaken everyone. A true Gilmore."
"EMILY: Through and through."
"ANTONIA: Dinner is ready."
"EMILY: Thank you Antonia. Shall we?"
"RICHARD: Ah ah ah ah, after the top 3 percent in her class."
"RORY: Well, thank you very much."
"LORELAI: Uh, just go ahead and Start without me. I gotta check in at the inn. Michel's there by himself, people could die."
"EMILY: Well, hurry up."
"[Lorelai dials her cell phone and walks out onto the back patio.]"
"MAX: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Where are we gonna live?"
"MAX: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Where are we gonna live?"
"MAX: Well, I. . ."
"LORELAI: Your house, my house?"
"MAX: I don't know."
"LORELAI: I mean, we should figure this stuff out. I have a life and a kid, and both of them require a house of some sort."
"MAX: Okay, but. . ."
"LORELAI: And I have stuff. I have a lot of stuff. You haven't seen my closet yet, but you would not believe the amount of stuff one person can accumulate. I don't even know what this stuff is, but it's there and it's mine and it needs a place to live."
"MAX: Well. . ."
"LORELAI: And I want to work."
"MAX: What?"
"LORELAI: And I like my bank."
"MAX: Okay hold on."
"LORELAI: It's small and the teller's name is Margie and she can't count. And I think there's something so poetic about banking at a place where the teller can't count."
"MAX: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MAX: Calm down. Talk to me."
"LORELAI: It's just. . . . If I die, I want you to know where the coupon drawer is."
"MAX: Well, I would like that too. I think."
"LORELAI: Well, we need to figure these things out before. . ."
"MAX: Before what? Are you saying yes?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"MAX: Are you saying yes?"
"LORELAI: Why are you asking me that?"
"MAX: Because you call me, out of the blue, completely panicked about where we're gonna live and bank and coupon drawers and Margie."
"LORELAI: Well, these are important things to discuss."
"MAX: I agree. They're extremely important things to discuss, especially if you're saying yes. Are you?"
"[CUT TO DINING ROOM]"
"EMILY: I am extremely thrilled about this. Do you think you'll get a certificate?"
"RORY: I'm not sure."
"EMILY: Well, they certainly should give you a certificate or a plaque or something. I'll talk to Bitty about that tomorrow."
"RICHARD: I can't wait to tell Tellman McCabe about this."
"EMILY: Oh Richard."
"RICHARD: Oh, he's always bragging about that simpleton grandson of his."
"EMILY: William is a lovely boy."
"RICHARD: His head is shaped like a football."
"EMILY: It is not."
"RICHARD: If he fell asleep in the park, someone would try to punt him."
"EMILY: Tellman is a very dear friend of yours."
"RICHARD: Yes he is. And one should always share wonderful news with one's very good friends."
"EMILY: You just want to brag."
"[Lorelai walks to dining room doorway. Rory looks at her.]"
"RICHARD: Well, I think I have a right, don't you?"
"EMILY: Well goodness, you'd think you were the one who finished in the top three percent of your class."
"[Lorelai smiles and nods to Rory]"
"RICHARD: Well it was my genes, I get to claim a little responsibility."
"[Rory screams, jumps up, and runs over to hug Lorelai]"
"RICHARD: Oh!"
"EMILY: Goodness."
"RICHARD: I just spilled on my shirt. What are you doing? What are they doing Emily?"
"EMILY: I have no idea. Stop that you too!"
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: Yeah sorry."
"EMILY: What is going on?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm just really jazzed about this whole three percent thing."
"RORY: Yeah, really really jazzed."
"LORELAI: Yeah. [more screaming and hugging]"
"EMILY: Don't even try to understand Richard. Antonia, please bring some club soda for Mr. Gilmore's shirt."
"[CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN'S KITCHEN]"
"SOOKIE: Carlito, we're running out of clarified butter. Ooh, chop that finer. No hard boiling. Yo profiero tener los huevos suave. Ooh, that looks good. Add a little pinch of oregano, I think we've got it."
"DELIVERY MAN: Okay, I got your lobsters."
"SOOKIE: Yeah? Are they good? Ooh, they look good. Yes they do. Ow! It's got my hand. It's got my hand. Thanks. Okay, I'll be fine, I'll be fine. I'm a good cotter, don't worry. You are fresh, aren't you? Okay, in the back, in the back, in the back. Michel, I'm gonna need you to move."
"MICHEL: In a minute."
"SOOKIE: What are you doing?"
"MICHEL: I am weighing my turkey."
"SOOKIE: Why?"
"MICHEL: A group of scientists did a study on rats where they cut their daily calories by thirty percent."
"SOOKIE: And you felt left out?"
"MICHEL: No, the rats lived thirty percent longer. And the scientists were so impressed that they cut their own calories just like the rats."
"SOOKIE: That was a very nice display of solidarity."
"MICHEL: I have decided to do the same. I figure if I stay alive long enough, these scientists, they will be able to cure anything including death, therefore ensuring my indefinite existence."
"SOOKIE: So you're gonna live forever, like on Fame?"
"MICHEL: Don't speak to me."
"SOOKIE: Give me back my scale."
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen.]"
"LORELAI: Hey. I have an announcement to make, and it's big and it's fabulous and you are not gonna believe it."
"MICHEL: Goodbye."
"LORELAI: Wait, I got news."
"MICHEL: Oh, well I'm sure it's very exciting. Excuse me."
"LORELAI: But. . . What's with the turkey?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, Michel thinks he's gonna live forever."
"LORELAI: Like on Fame?"
"SOOKIE: That's what I said!"
"MICHEL: Hmm, a hundred years from now I will sit around telling my fellow man of science about the two of you and we will giggle like little girls at your ignorance. Now I have work to do. [Michel leaves]"
"LORELAI: He did say ""giggle like little girls"" right?"
"SOOKIE: Forget him. Tell me about your fabulous news."
"LORELAI: I'm engaged."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: I'm getting married."
"SOOKIE: No!"
"LORELAI: Yes!"
"SOOKIE: No!"
"LORELAI: Yes!"
"SOOKIES: No!"
"LORELAI: Yes!"
"SOOKIE: No!"
"LORELAI: No?"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: God, this is amazing! Oh my God, I'm shaking! Max is a wonderful man. It is Max, right?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it is Max."
"SOOKIE: Okay, good good good. Oh, I knew it. I knew you'd get engaged."
"LORELAI: Really? God, I didn't."
"SOOKIE: You're gonna be a sadie."
"LORELAI: A what?"
"SOOKIE: A sadie. [sings] ""Sadie, sadie, married lady. Meet a mortgagee."""
"LORELAI: Funny Girl!"
"SOOKIE: Streisand!"
"LORELAI: Love it!"
"SOOKIE: Who's catering?"
"LORELAI: Um, Bobby Flay?"
"SOOKIE: Not funny. I'm making the cake also."
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"SOOKIE: Okay, let's start a menu. Something light and romantic to start with. Something that will go wonderful with champagne. Truffles go wonderful with champagne. And scrambled eggs. [starts to cry]"
"LORELAI: Sookie? Honey?"
"SOOKIE: I know scrambled eggs don't sound very festive, but when you put them in a little quail's egg shell and you put cavier on top, they are quite a crowd pleaser."
"LORELAI: Hey, what's with the waterworks lady?"
"SOOKIE: It's just. . .I don't know. You raised that little girl all alone, and she is so great, and you work your butt off here and you go to school and you put up with me."
"LORELAI: Aww, honey."
"SOOKIE: You just really deserve this."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Jackson walks into kitchen carrying a crate of brussel sprouts.]"
"JACKSON: Prepare yourself for the most gorgeous brussel sprouts ever. Sookie, are you okay? Are you hurt? Have you been making cutlets again?"
"SOOKIE: Lorelai's getting married! Married! Uh, I love saying that! Married, married, married!"
"JACKSON: Oh, that's great. Congratulations."
"LORELAI: Thanks Jackson."
"JACKSON: Uh, hey, do you wanna look at the brussel sprouts?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, I do. [giggles] No. Ooh, what about some nice brussel sprouts with like a garlic olive oil for the wedding? That sounds like a 'til death do us part' kind of side dish, doesn't it?"
"JACKSON: Yeah, I wouldn't know."
"SOOKIE: Well, what do you think is the most romantic vegetable?"
"JACKSON: You know, I'm the wrong guy to ask."
"SOOKIE: You're the vegetable guy."
"JACKSON: Yeah, but the normal vegetable guy, not the romantic vegetable guy. I mean, I would have no idea what an appropriate vegetable would be to serve at a wedding. I've never even been to a wedding. One, my cousin BonBon. Yes, that's his real name. And I didn't stay long, and I didn't notice the vegetables, so I would not be the guy to ask about wedding vegetables. I'm not the wedding vegetable guy! [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Uh oh. Jackson's got panicked ""my girlfriend wants me to get married"" face on."
"SOOKIE: Yup. Hey, next time he's here, tell him that you're pregnant."
"LORELAI: With twins."
"SOOKIE: Why not?"
"[CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE]"
"[Rory's in the living room on the phone with Lane, who's sitting in her closet.]"
"RORY: Okay, so what's the latest?"
"LANE: I just got off the phone with the American consulate."
"RORY: And?"
"LANE: Can you say Hyung-hyung?"
"RORY: No, and what is that?"
"LANE: My Korean name."
"RORY: There must be something you can do."
"LANE: I'm a minor. I've been put in the custody of family by my parents. That's it, it's over."
"RORY: You have to at least try to talk to your family."
"LANE: I don't know."
"MRS. KIM: [calls from downstairs] Dinner!"
"LANE: I have to go. Last meal."
"RORY: Call me later."
"MRS. KIM: [calls] Lanie!"
"LANE: Coming Mama!"
"[CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE]"
"[Rory walks into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Do you want tater tots also?"
"RORY: That's a rhetorical question right?"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: So, what kind of dress are you thinking of?"
"LORELAI: Um, the one Stephanie Seymour wore in the g*n N' Roses video."
"RORY: What about colors? Did you pick your colors yet?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: Really? What?"
"LORELAI: Spumoni."
"RORY: Okay, I am planning this wedding without you. You will have no say and I may not even let you come."
"LORELAI: Uh!"
"[phone rings]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"MAX: Rory, good, it's Max."
"RORY: Oh, hey Max."
"MAX: Oh look, I've been out ring shopping all day."
"RORY: Ring shopping. Very interesting."
"MAX: Now I've narrowed it down to three different rings, but I want to get her something she's really gonna like, not just something that she tells me she likes but really hates, and you know her taste in jewelry better than I do, so I thought maybe you could give me some advice."
"RORY: Okay, well, anything with the word ""Foxy"" on it is a big crowd pleaser."
"MAX: Oh, maybe for our first anniversary."
"RORY: Okay, I'm listening."
"MAX: Okay. The first ring has a gold band and sort of a square diamond. It's simple, but very classic."
"RORY: Gold band, square diamond, simple, classic. [Lorelai shakes her head] I'm not sure that's really her."
"MAX: Okay, the next one is sort of an engagement band with small diamonds all around it, white gold, and there's a wedding band that sort of fits into it like a set."
"RORY: White gold engagement band, small diamonds around it, with wedding band that fits into it. [Lorelai gestures that she might like it] That's a possibility. What's the third one?"
"MAX: The third one is from the twenties."
"RORY: From the twenties, hmm."
"MAX: Large diamond in the middle."
"RORY: Large diamond in the middle."
"MAX: Diamond clusters on the sides."
"RORY: Diamond clusters on the sides."
"MAX: A little deco."
"RORY: A little deco. [Lorelai pants and barks like a dog] That sounds great. Uh, good going. She's gonna be ecstatic."
"MAX: She's right there with you isn't she?"
"RORY: What? No."
"MAX: No, I thought I heard her bark."
"RORY: No, that's just a wild jackal that hangs out here sometimes."
"MAX: Mm hmm. Put Cujo on the phone please."
"RORY: One sec. [hands phone to Lorelai] Here boy."
"[knock at front door]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hello Max, what a pleasant surprise. I just walked in."
"[Rory answers door]"
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: Am I late?"
"RORY: Nope, right on time."
"DEAN: Good."
"RORY: Are you coming in?"
"DEAN: In a sec. Ah, where's your mom?"
"RORY: In the kitchen on the phone."
"DEAN: Beginning, middle, or end of a conversation?"
"RORY: Well, it concerns jewelry so there may not be an end to the conversation."
"DEAN: Good. Hi."
"RORY: Hi. [they kiss]"
"DEAN: I missed that."
"RORY: Me too."
"DEAN: So, uh, ya know, this whole breaking up thing, we tried it. . ."
"RORY: Yeah we did. Didn't really work for me."
"DEAN: Me either."
"RORY: Okay good, so it's decided. Breaking up, not for us."
"DEAN: I mean, hey, not that it's a bad thing. I'm sure some people like it."
"[they walk into kitchen]"
"RORY: Oh sure, Cher, Greg Allman, bet they'd give it a big thumbs up. [To Lorelai] Did you pick out your ring?"
"LORELAI: Yup, he's gonna surprise me with it tomorrow."
"RORY: Twenties deco?"
"LORELAI: Supposedly ripped right off of Zelda Fitzgerald's cold dead hand. Hey Dean."
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: When is dinner ready?"
"LORELAI: Do I look like a timer?"
"RORY: I thought you might have set one."
"LORELAI: Silly rabbit."
"RORY: Timers are for kids."
"LORELAI: I say 10 minutes, we're there."
"RORY: I'll get us set up."
"DEAN: So what's the movie for tonight?"
"LORELAI: Oh my god, a classic."
"RORY: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story, starring. . ."
"LORELAI: Joan and Melissa Rivers. A mother and daughter torn apart by tragedy."
"RORY: su1c1de."
"LORELAI: Not getting The Tonight Show."
"RORY: Mean boyfriends."
"LORELAI: Identical noses."
"RORY: You'll laugh, you'll cry."
"LORELAI: Because you're laughing so hard."
"RORY: It'll be an evening to remember."
"LORELAI: And in the pivotal scene where a very distraught Joan gets locked out of High Holiday Services because she's late, I will be forced to rewind it and play it over and over about four thousand times."
"RORY: You'll never be the same. [Rory leaves the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: So"
"DEAN: So."
"LORELAI: It's nice to have you back."
"DEAN: Thanks, it's nice to be back."
"LORELAI: We missed you."
"DEAN: I missed you guys too."
"LORELAI: No, I mean we really really missed you."
"DEAN: You need the water bottle changed, don't you?"
"LORELAI: Desperately."
"DEAN: Rag."
"LORELAI: [hands him a towel] Thank you."
"[Dean walks out the back door. Rory walks back into the kitchen.]"
"RORY: Where's Dean?"
"LORELAI: Getting water."
"RORY: You're shameless."
"LORELAI: He offered."
"RORY: Please."
"LORELAI: The first thing he said to me was 'Hey Lorelai, can I change your water?' What can I do? The kid's a freak."
"[Cut to back porch. Rory walks out the back door.]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hey, I'm so sorry she's got you doing chores already."
"DEAN: Aw, I don't mind."
"RORY: You will. She pulled out the mower this morning."
"DEAN: Well if that movie is anything like you described, mowing might be a good alternative."
"RORY: Hey, I wanted to ask you something."
"DEAN: Yeah?"
"RORY: My grandparents are having this special dinner for me next week. It's nothing big, but they said I could invite someone, and I thought, you've never seen my grandparents' house and I'd really like you to meet my Grandpa. What?"
"DEAN: Well, ah, it's just the last time I met your Grandma was the night of the dance and you know how that turned out, so..."
"RORY: The dance was a long time ago. She's over it by now. I'm sure everything would be fine."
"DEAN: You want me to go?"
"RORY: Yeah, I want you to go."
"DEAN: Then I'll go."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: [from inside house] Oh my, that coffee can is just so high up there, whatever will I do!"
"DEAN: Coming!"
"[CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE]"
"EMILY: Antonia, take this and put it in the dining room please. Oh, I like that tie!"
"RICHARD: It's rather snappy, isn't it? Oh, oh, oh."
"EMILY: Richard, don't you dare get on that phone. They'll be here any second."
"RICHARD: I'm not getting on the phone. I'm going to give Rory that first edition of Mencken's Chrestomathy."
"[doorbell rings. Emily answers door]"
"EMILY: Well, hello there! Well, hello there."
"RORY: Grandma, you remember Dean right?"
"EMILY: Yes I do, nice to see you again."
"DEAN: Thanks. Uh, your house is great. It's huge. I've never seen a house this huge before."
"EMILY: Well thank you. So few people bother to notice the hugeness of the house anymore."
"LORELAI: Mom, it was so nice of you to tell Rory to invite a friend tonight, seeing as this is her night. That was really nice of you."
"EMILY: It was my pleasure."
"LORELAI: Good."
"EMILY: Well, don't just stand there. We have a celebration to attend. Come in, come in."
"[They walk into the living room. Emily walks over to make drinks while the others sit down.]"
"EMILY: So, what would everyone like to drink?"
"LORELAI: Uh, well, I'll have a white wine and Dean'll have a beer."
"DEAN: What?!"
"LORELAI: Corona right?"
"DEAN: No, I don't want a beer! I don't drink beer. I'll have water or soda or anything. Or nothing. Not beer. Never beer. Beer is. . beer's bad."
"EMILY: Relax Dean, that's just Lorelai's little sense of humor. You're very cruel."
"LORELAI: Well, yes, keeps me young."
"DEAN: I'm just gonna sit here and stare at my hands."
"EMILY: Soda Dean?"
"DEAN: Please."
"EMILY: Rory?"
"RORY: Oh, I'll have a beer. [Emily and Lorelai laugh] I'm sorry Dean, we're not laughing at you."
"LORELAI: Oh wait, I think I was."
"EMILY: I think I was a little too. [Richard enters] Oh Richard, there you are. Come join us."
"LORELAI: Hey Dad."
"RORY: Grandpa, hi. This is Dean. Dean, this is my Grandpa."
"DEAN: Hi. Sorry, uh, hi. [walks over to him]"
"RICHARD: Hello."
"DEAN: [offers to shake his hand] It's uh. . it's nice to meet. . ."
"RICHARD: Does everyone have drinks?"
"LORELAI: Uh yeah, we all have drinks. Thanks."
"DEAN: [sits down, whispers to Lorelai] Should we do the beer thing again?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I don't think so."

"[CUT TO DINING ROOM]"
"RORY: Grandma, I can't believe you found the recipe for Beefaroni."
"EMILY: It wasn't easy. Antonia thought I'd gone insane."
"LORELAI: Well . . ."
"EMILY: No one needs a comment from you."
"LORELAI: No, I was just gonna say, what's the secret?"
"EMILY: Well, let's just say it's not beef."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay, I'm done."
"RORY: Me too."
"EMILY: Dean, would you like some more?"
"DEAN: Uh, no. I'm fine, thanks."
"EMILY: Well, then I guess it must be present time."
"RORY: You didn't have to."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, Mom, you didn't have to. Unless you got something that'll fit me too, in which case, good going."
"EMILY: [hands her a gift] Here you go, Rory. Congratulations, we're so proud."
"RORY: Thanks Grandma. Thanks Grandpa."
"EMILY: Now go on, open it."
"RORY: Okay. [opens gift]"
"LORELAI: Oh, pens. All yours."
"RORY: It's beautiful."
"LORELAI: I think the top student deserved the top tools."
"RORY: Thank you so much. Really."
"LORELAI: Uh, uh, well, pens are very nice, but I just bet there is a fabulous fancy dessert just sitting out there in that kitchen of yours."
"EMILY: As a matter of fact there is. Twinkies."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Well, Rory told me that was her favorite dessert."
"LORELAI: Emily Gilmore, you are one classy broad."
"EMILY: Antonia, please bring out the Twinkies."
"LORELAI: I can't believe I just heard you say those words."
"EMILY: Well, don't get used to it."
"RICHARD: So, Dean, where are you planning to go to college?"
"DEAN: Oh, uh, well I. . ."
"LORELAI: Geez Dad, start off with 'what's your favorite baseball team' or something."
"RICHARD: I'm talking to Dean."
"DEAN: I don't know yet."
"RICHARD: You don't?"
"DEAN: No, not yet."
"RICHARD: Well, what kind of grades do you get?"
"EMILY: Richard please, don't grill the boy."
"RICHARD: I'm not grilling the boy Emily. It's an easy question. A's, B's, C's?"
"DEAN: I get a mixture actually."
"RICHARD: Mixture? [laughs] What's the ratio?"
"EMILY: Richard."
"RICHARD: I'm just trying to get to know the boy Emily. After all, Rory brings home a young man to dinner, the least we can do is learn something about him."
"LORELAI: He changes a mean water bottle."
"DEAN: I get a couple A's, couple B's, few C's."
"RICHARD: Really?"
"DEAN: I'm not great in math."
"LORELAI: Yeah, except who is really? You know, except mathematicians or the blackjack dealers, or I guess Stephen Hawking doesn't suck, but you know You know what else is good though Mom, is a Ho-Ho. Because if you can't find a Twinkie, you know, treat yourself to a nice Ho-Ho. How long does it take to open a box?"
"EMILY: She's making them."
"LORELAI: She's making the Twinkies? You're kidding."
"EMILY: Oh Richard, wasn't there a book you wanted to give Rory?"
"RICHARD: In a minute. So Dean. . ."
"RORY: Uh, Grandpa?"
"RICHARD: You do know that Rory is going to an Ivy League school?"
"DEAN: I know."
"RICHARD: Harvard, Princeton, Yale."
"LORELAI: He said he knew Dad."
"RICHARD: You need top grades to get into a top school."
"DEAN: Yeah, well, Rory's really smart."
"RICHARD: Yeah, she is really smart."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, why don't we all go sit in the uh. . ."
"RICHARD: So, how are you planning to make a living once you graduate from this college you haven't thought anything about yet?"
"RORY: Grandpa, can we talk about something else?"
"EMILY: I'm going to get that book. [leaves]"
"RICHARD: I asked you a question."
"DEAN: I don't know what I want to do."
"RICHARD: You know, when I was ten years old, I knew exactly where I wanted to work."
"LORELAI: That's because you were always picked last for dodgeball."
"RICHARD: I knew I wanted to go to Yale, and put on a nice suit everyday and be a very important man in a very powerful firm. And I knew I wanted to travel and see the world."
"DEAN: Well, that's great."
"RICHARD: I wanted to see La Traviata at the La Scala Operahouse. I wanted to walk the ruins of Pompeii. I wanted to travel the far east . . ."
"LORELAI: And be a ballerina or a fireman."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, this isn't funny."
"LORELAI: It's a little funny to think of a ten-year-old kid dreaming of the La Scala Operahouse."
"RICHARD: Rory does. Rory wants to travel. Rory has plans."
"LORELAI: Rory's special."
"RICHARD: Yes. Exactly. Rory is special"
"DEAN: Well, I know that Rory is special."
"EMILY: [returns with book] I got it."
"RORY: Dean is special too, Grandpa."
"DEAN: Rory."
"RORY: You don't even know him."
"RICHARD: I know enough."
"RORY: No you don't. Dean is incredible and he's special to me and I bring him here and you attack him."
"RICHARD: I will not be spoken to like that in my house."
"EMILY: Richard here, give her the book."
"RICHARD: This family has standards. You live up to them, and you should expect that everyone that you spend time with live up to them also. You are a gifted girl with immense promise, and you should learn very early that certain people can hold you back."
"RORY: Grandpa, stop it! You cannot treat Dean this way."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, excuse me, I have to work. [leaves the table]"
"RORY: Grandpa! Thank you for the dinner and the gift Grandma, but I really think we should be going. [leaves]"
"DEAN: Thanks. Sorry. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Am I crazy? That's supposed to be us right?"
"[CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD]"
"LORELAI: Well, want to come in and have some dessert? You never did get your Twinkie."
"DEAN: Uh, no thanks. I think I should get going."
"RORY: Are you sure?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, Dean, all I can say is that tonight, you officially became a Gilmore Girl. Feels good, huh?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"LORELAI: See you later. [to Rory] Meet you inside."
"RORY: I don't even know what to say."
"DEAN: It's no big deal."
"RORY: I had no ideaI thought he wouldI am so sorry Dean."
"DEAN: It's not your fault."
"RORY: None of those things he said were true. None of them mean anything. I don't know what made him act that way. I just. . ."
"DEAN: You know what, let's just forget it. All right?"
"RORY: Please, don't be upset."
"DEAN: I'm not."
"RORY: Dean."
"DEAN: I'm fine. I'm not upset. I have to go. Call you tomorrow."
"RORY: Okay."
"[CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN]"
"RORY: That man is impossible."
"LORELAI: Twinkie?"
"RORY: He just attacked Dean out of nowhere. And Dean is sitting there, being perfectly nice, and then all of a sudden. . . Ugh, God, I'm so mad. He's a snob."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: And he doesn't listen. He just wants to say horrible things and have you sit there and listen to him and then just agree with him. What is that all about?"
"LORELAI: Ah, that is about a hundred years worth of inbreeding."
"RORY: I've never seen him be mean before. Ever, not like that. I don't know how I'll ever talk to him again. And Dean. He must be so upset right now. I hate that he did this to him, I hate it."
"LORELAI: Yes, it was bad. My father was in fine form tonight. But. . ."
"RORY: But? There's a but, from you there's a but?"
"LORELAI: Twinkie. I don't think my father has ever loved anything in this world as much as he loves you. Now, that having been established, let's just consider that maybe this flipout tonight actually came from somewhere that possibly has nothing to do with Dean and very possibly has nothing to do with you."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: You are the great white hope of the Gilmore clan. You are their angel sent from up above. You are the daughter they didn't have."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No, it's not a 'feel sorry for me' thing. It's just the truth. I mean, you're gonna go to college. Hell, you're gonna graduate from high school. They're gonna get to watch you walk down the aisle wearing your cap and gown and get your diploma and go to Harvard and be a Phi Beta Bimbo and graduate with honors and just set the world on fire. And that is the plan, looks like it's gonna happen."
"RORY: It is going to happen. Except for that Phi Beta Bimbo part."
"LORELAI: But then tonight you walk in with this beautiful boy who likes you enough to brave going to your grandparents house for dinner, and Dad looks at you and sees you with him and all of a sudden, has a terrible Lorelai flashback. He sees it all going away, the college, the cap and gown and. . ."
"RORY: But I'm not going to get pregnant."
"LORELAI: I know that."
"RORY: He should know it."
"LORELAI: Yes, he should, but you do have my eyes."
"RORY: You do realize you just spent the last ten minutes defending your dad."
"LORELAI: I know. I'm gonna have terrible nightmares all night long. But I'll tell you what. If you cut him a little slack, I'll wear my p*rn star t-shirt to dinner next week."
"RORY: Deal."
"LORELAI: Good."
"[Phone rings. Rory answers it.]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LANE: I just thought you should know that my parents just brought in the suitcase that I'm supposed to take on my trip and to paint you a picture, it can fit you and me plus everything we own and still have enough room to do a little souvenir shopping. I am never coming back."
"[CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE]"
"RICHARD: What is Lorelai thinking letting Rory run around with a boy like that. Well, of course, she isn't thinking! She never thinks."
"EMILY: Richard, please, you're giving me a headache."
"RICHARD: And what were you thinking inviting him over here?"
"EMILY: We told her she could invite someone. You were right there."
"RICHARD: I did not mean him."
"EMILY: Please calm down."
"RICHARD: I will not calm down. Did you hear the way she talked to me?"
"EMILY: Yes, I heard the way she talked to you."
"RICHARD: She sounded like her mother."
"EMILY: You were attacking her boyfriend."
"RICHARD: A girl that age shouldn't have a boyfriend."
"EMILY: You truly think a sixteen year old girl isn't gonna date?"
"RICHARD: Well, of course she's going to date, and she should date. The proper socialization is important to a child. But she should not date one boy and she should not date him. [phone rings] Don't answer that."
"EMILY: I'm going to answer it."
"RICHARD: Emily, we are in the middle of a discussion."
"EMILY: I'm sure you will remember exactly where you were five minutes from now. Hello?"
"SOOKIE: Hi, Mrs. Gilmore? It's Sookie St. James, Lorelai's friend. I don't know if you remember me."
"EMILY: Oh yes, you're the chef at the Inn."
"SOOKIE: That's right. Listen, I'm sorry to call so late, but I need to ask you a question. I'm planning a surprise wedding shower for Lorelai and Max, and it's gonna be more like a big party actually. But I've cleared the date with everybody around here, so we're all set to go, but I wanted to make sure you guys were gonna be around before I finalized everything. It's going to be Saturday the 21st."
"EMILY: I don't know, I'd have to check."
"SOOKIE: Okay, Okay. You check, and then you call me at the inn, okay?"
"EMILY: Yes, I'll get back to you."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"[CUT TO RICHARD'S OFFICE]"
"EMILY: I want you to call Rory tomorrow and apologize."
"RICHARD: What?"
"EMILY: I want you to call her and tell her you're sorry. That you weren't feeling well and you think that Dean is a lovely boy and he's welcome here anytime."
"RICHARD: Have you gone insane? Under no circumstance will I ..."
"EMILY: Our daughter is getting married. She's getting married and she didn't tell us. When Rory decides to get married, I'd like her to tell us. Call her tomorrow. [Emily leaves, starts to cry]"
"[CUT TO LORELAI'S PORCH.]"
"LORELAI: It was awful."
"MAX: Sounds awful."
"LORELAI: That's the family you want to marry into."
"MAX: I must be insane."
"LORELAI: Must be."
"MAX: Hmm, and speaking of marrying into."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"MAX: I have a little something for you."
"LORELAI: Let me guess. Is it gum, 'cause you know how much I like gum. How concerned I am about dental hygiene. [Max shows her the ring] Uh, oh my."
"MAX: You like?"
"LORELAI: It's beautiful."
"[Max puts the ring on her finger]"
"MAX: Oh, it's too big."
"LORELAI: No, it's not."
"MAX: Here, give it to me."
"LORELAI: Oh, what? No, you can't have it back."
"MAX: Well, I'll get it sized."
"LORELAI: No, it's okay."
"MAX: Well, it's gonna fall off."
"LORELAI: I'll wear it on my thumb."
"MAX: You're not gonna wear it on your thumb."
"LORELAI: I'll eat a lot of salt and bloat up."
"MAX: Just let me get it sized and I promise you'll never have to take it off again. In fact, I'm going to insist on it."
"LORELAI: No, just in a minute, okay?"
"MAX: Okay."
"LORELAI: I'm getting married."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is on the couch in the living room as Lorelai calls her from upstairs.]"
"LORELAI: Rory!"
"RORY: Living room!"
"[Lorelai comes down the steps wearing a newspaper veil on her head.]"
"LORELAI: I need your advice on something. What do you think?"
"RORY: Huh."
"LORELAI: Not good?"
"RORY: I'm not sure. Have you tried the Arts and Leisure section?"
"LORELAI: I need you to be serious."
"RORY: You are wearing a newspaper on your head."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: And you need me to be serious?"
"LORELAI: I am trying to figure out veil lengths here."
"RORY: Oh, well sure."
"LORELAI: See, I kind of like this shoulder length kind of semi-poofy thing like this."
"RORY: Mm hmm."
"LORELAI: But there's also a longer one that might be interesting."
"RORY: Longer, sure."
"LORELAI: And then there's the full on Diana."
"RORY: Right, right."
"LORELAI: Which is nice but it just might be a little. . . . You're reading me."
"RORY: Wait, don't move."
"LORELAI: Rory, stop it."
"RORY: This Putin arms race thing is really getting crazy."
"LORELAI: I am trying to have a serious conversation about the most important fashion decision of my life."
"RORY: Why don't you go to a wedding dress place and try a real veil on?"
"LORELAI: No way."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Too much taffeta, it gives me cotillion flashbacks."
"RORY: Okay fine. Could you bend over so I can see what the weather's gonna be like tomorrow?"
"LORELAI: Actually, I went in one of those places yesterday."
"RORY: You did? Which one?"
"LORELAI: Marry Mimi's."
"RORY: Ooh, I see we're going top of the line."
"LORELAI: Ugh, it was horrible. Apparently, you're supposed to order your wedding dress the first day of junior high, and if you haven't, it's off the rack for you missy. I tried on three different dresses, one of which gave me a rash. And I gotta say, has anyone missed the bustle? 'Cause I haven't."
"RORY: It was not that bad."
"LORELAI: They all looked wrong. I'm gonna be gross and all the children will laugh and Max will realize he's made a horrible mistake and then people will walk away, exactly as you're doing now."
"RORY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: Wedding dress shopping."
"LORELAI: Uhhh, you're reading."
"RORY: I'm done."
"LORELAI: Uh, you need to see Dean."
"RORY: He's playing softball."
"LORELAI: Your cure for cancer's almost finished."
"RORY: We are going to find the perfect thing for you to walk down the aisle in your perfect wedding day, where there will be no pointing, mocking or walking out."
"LORELAI: I did not say pointing, why did you say pointing?"
"RORY: Keys."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Paris, Madeline, and Louise are standing next to a bulletin board.]"
"LOUISE: Ooh, spending the summer at Chilton. Happy happy, joy joy."
"MADELINE: If I don't improve my French grades, I can kiss Vassar goodbye."
"PARIS: You need to follow a study schedule. I've been telling you this second grade."
"LOUISE: Yes, which worries both of us."
"MADELINE: Maybe I won't go to college."
"PARIS: You have to go to college."
"LOUISE: Princess Grace didn't go to college."
"PARIS: Thank you for the history lesson, A.J. Benza."
"LOUISE: Take a pill."
"PARIS: Marry rich."
"[Rory walks over to them]"
"MADELINE: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"MADELINE: You doing the summer school thing too?"
"RORY: Uh, yeah."
"MADELINE: What classes are you taking?"
"RORY: Well, I uh"
"LOUISE: Ahem."
"MADELINE: What?"
"RORY: Uh, you're not talking to me."
"MADELINE: I'm not?"
"LOUISE: Tristin."
"PARIS: PJ Harvey."
"MADELINE: Oh yeah."
"RORY: I'm just gonna look at the bulletin board, and then you can back to your conversation."
"MADELINE: There's a Rebuilding Together thing going on tomorrow. You know, they fix up homes for the needy. It's a total easy outdoor denim gig that looks really great on your college transcript. Sorry."
"RORY: Thanks, I'll think about it."
"PARIS: You wouldn't like it."
"RORY: 'Cause you'll be there?"
"PARIS: Yes, I'll be there."
"RORY: I'll think about it."
"[Rory walks away. Paris follows her.]"
"PARIS: You don't want to go."
"RORY: I'll see."
"PARIS: You don't, it's not you."
"RORY: I have multiple personalities. It might be one of me."
"PARIS: It's hours of hammering and drilling and dirt and it's horrible. You'll hate it."
"RORY: How do you know? How do you know that I don't spend hours every week hammering and drilling? And dirt, I love dirt. I collect it."
"PARIS: You're hilarious."
"RORY: You're pathetic."
"PARIS: Fine. Forget it."
"[Paris walks back towards the bulletin board. Rory follows her.]"
"RORY: Why don't you want me to go?"
"PARIS: I don't care if you go."
"RORY: You just spent a great deal of energy trying to convince me not to."
"PARIS: I'm late for class."
"RORY: Are you seriously going to be mad about the fact that you thought I was going out with Tristin even though I wasn't for the rest of your life?"
"PARIS: I have great commitment."
"RORY: And you don't see how stupid that is?"
"PARIS: I'm sorry if you thought we had some kind of deep Thelma and Louise thing going here, but we didn't."
"RORY: Well, have it your way, but I'm going tomorrow."
"PARIS: Fine. Go. See if I care."
"RORY: I will."
"PARIS: Great. I hate summer."
"[Paris, Madeline and Louise leave. Henry walks up to Rory.]"
"HENRY: Rory?"
"RORY: Oh, Henry, hi. Nice to see you."
"HENRY: You too. What classes are you taking?"
"RORY: Shakespeare, physics, obscure Russian poetry."
"HENRY: Wow. I'm still trying to get through trig. But hey, third time's the charm."
"RORY: I can help you if you want."
"HENRY: I just may take you up on that."
"RORY: Okay."
"HENRY: Okay."
"RORY: Lane's fine."
"HENRY: Is she? Good, 'cause I haven't talked to her in awhile. I called."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"HENRY: Once. I called once."
"RORY: And?"
"HENRY: Her mother answered."
"RORY: Oops."
"HENRY: She sounded angry."
"RORY: No, that's just Mrs. Kim."
"HENRY: I hung up. Twelve times. And then on the thirteenth time she said she was gonna have the FBI trace the call and have me thrown in prison. And although I know logically that the punishment for multiple hang ups probably isn't prison, she just sounded so capable of doing real damage that I. . ."
"RORY: Stopped calling?"
"HENRY: And now Lane probably thinks that I forgot about her, and. . ."
"RORY: You'd like for me to tell her that you haven't."
"HENRY: That would be good."
"RORY: Done."
"HENRY: And maybe you could give her my number and she could call me."
"RORY: I'll get right on it."
"HENRY: Aw thanks. [writes his number down, hands the paper to Rory] Thank you."
"RORY: Uh huh."
"HENRY: Okay. Bye"
"RORY: Bye. Uh, henry?"
"HENRY: What?"
"RORY: Your trig notes."
"HENRY: Ahhh."
"RORY: I think we may have nailed down the problem."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory pull up and walk to the front door talking.]"
"LORELAI: Mom, tomorrow I'm going to build a house."
"RORY: Help build a house."
"LORELAI: Did you tell them that there's a light bulb in your closet that b*rned out in '97 that you still haven't changed?"
"RORY: It's for charity."
"LORELAI: Wow, don't those people have enough problems without having you as a contractor?"
"RORY: I'm sure there will be real construction workers there."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: I will be assisting, I will be helping out those less fortunate than myself, I will be getting college credit and this is the end of this particular conversation."
"LORELAI: You're right. It's a good thing. Nice, keeps your halo shiny. Oh wait, wait. [takes off her engagement ring]"
"RORY: When are you going to tell them?"
"LORELAI: Soon."
"RORY: When's soon?"
"LORELAI: When the big hand hits the ""S"" and the little hand hits the ""OON."""
"RORY: You're getting married in three months."
"LORELAI: Ring the bell."
"RORY: I think you should tell them now."
"LORELAI: Ring the bell."
"RORY: The longer you wait the harder it's gonna be."
"LORELAI: For the love of God, will you please ring the bell."
"RORY: You can tell them before dinner."
"LORELAI: I will tell them when I'm ready to tell them. You have to accept that because I'm the mother and you're the daughter, and in some cultures, that means you have to do what I say."
"RORY: If you don't tell them in two weeks, I will."
"LORELAI: Though apparently not in this one."
"RORY: Good. [rings doorbell]"
"[Emily answers the door]"
"EMILY: We're going to have to eat quickly, your father has a very early flight tomorrow morning. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm good. Yeah, and Rory's gonna build a house tomorrow. I know, I thought it was a little weird too."
"EMILY: Walk as you babble please."
"LORELAI: [to Rory] Somebody must have scratched the silver."
"[walk to dining room]"
"EMILY: [to maid] Bring the bread out too. And pour the wine please. [to L/R] Come on, hurry up."
"LORELAI: Yeah, 'cause we don't want our salad to get cold."
"EMILY: Richard, dinner!"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Eat eat."
"LORELAI: Shouldn't we wait for Dad?"
"EMILY: Don't worry about him."
"LORELAI: He's the one with the early plane. We don't have to go anywhere tomorrow. We can stay all night. Have a party, do some Jell-O shots, play light as a feather, stiff as a board. Okay, pass the bread."
"RORY: Grandma, would you like some. . ."
"EMILY: Yes please."
"RICHARD: You started."
"EMILY: You have a six o'clock flight."
"RICHARD: Six o'clock, are you sure?"
"EMILY: What do you mean, am I sure? Of course I'm sure. I double-checked it three times with your secretary because I know she's an idiot and all three times she told me six o'clock. I wrote it down, I have your ticket right out on the. . . You're teasing me."
"RICHARD: Very possible."
"EMILY: I don't find that amusing, Richard."
"RICHARD: Exactly the point of teasing, Emily. Hello Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hello Father."
"RICHARD: Rory."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"RICHARD: May I speak with you for a moment, please?"
"RORY: Okay."
"[Richard and Rory leave the room.]"
"LORELAI: Hmm, I wonder what that's all about. I guess we'll find out later, right? Hey, whatever happened to Shusha?"
"CUT TO BACK PATIO"
"RICHARD: I just thought we should touch base, you and I, after that unfortunate incident last week."
"RORY: Grandpa, you already called me about that."
"RICHARD: Yes, I know, but I thought taking a moment to once again say to you in person, how. . ."
"RORY: I know, and I appreciate it."
"RICHARD: We'd never had a fight."
"RORY: No."
"RICHARD: This was our first one."
"RORY: Yes it was."
"RICHARD: And I must say, I didn't care for it."
"RORY: Neither did I."
"RICHARD: Well, all right. We should go back inside. We're find now, right?"
"RORY: We're fine. Buck up, Private."
"RICHARD: Oh wait, I wanted to give you something."
"RORY: What?"
"RICHARD: Come on, come on."
"[they walk past the dining room]"
"LORELAI: Hey, where you guys going?"
"RICHARD: We'll be right there."
"LORELAI: Well, hurry, 'cause you're missing one hell of a conversation. You know, Mom, I'm really loving this salad dressing."
"EMILY: I'm glad."
"LORELAI: Lemony."
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: There's nothing like a nice salad of lemony goodness. [pause] Mom?"
"EMILY: Hmm?"
"LORELAI: I have something to tell you."
"EMILY: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Well it's like this. Um, . . .could you put down your fork for a second? Thank you. Okay, um, you know Max?"
"EMILY: No, I don't."
"LORELAI: Okay, I know you don't know him know him, but you know of him, right?"
"EMILY: I've heard rumblings."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, um, the. . .Max and I have been serious for quite awhile now, and he asked me to marry him, and I said yes. I'm getting married."
"EMILY: Well, I think that's very nice. I certainly hope we'll be in town for it, but if not I promise we'll send a nice gift. Now excuse me, I'm going to check on the roast."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking towards Luke's.]"
"RORY: Are you okay?"
"LORELAI: I'm perfect."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: I have hit a level of perfection that has rarely been seen outside the Victoria's Secret catalog."
"RORY: I'm really sorry."
"LORELAI: Aww, do not be sorry. What happened tonight was inevitable."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I should've known not to tell my mother."
"RORY: You were trying to be nice."
"LORELAI: Telling her I was getting married to a wonderful guy who will love me and make me happy. That, and giving her my address when I finally moved out, two worst moves I ever made."
"RORY: Maybe she'll think about it and call you and say she's sorry."
"LORELAI: Mom, I'm getting married. I'm an idiot. And you know, as my mouth was opening my mind was screaming, 'Don't do it, I mean it, you'll regret it!' But did my mouth listen?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: No! And it opened and the words came out, and Emily was Emily, and my mouth was stunned. And my mind said 'I told you so.' And then my mouth got mad because no mouth like's to have it's nose rubbed in it. And now my mind and my mouth aren't talking, and it'll be weeks before we can get the boys together again."
"RORY: Your mouth has a nose?"
"[they walk into Luke's Diner]"
"LORELAI: God, I'm crabby."
"RORY: You're hungry."
"LORELAI: No I'm not."
"RORY: Well you didn't eat any of your dinner."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, by the time I could get my jaw off the ground, Speed Racer had taken my plate."
"RORY: Luke will cheer you up, won't you Luke?"
"LUKE: Oh sure, I'm great at spreading the joy. What'll you have?"
"RORY: We'll have two coffees and a rant meal please. Extra cheese."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: I'm through ranting, the rant is over. I'll have an acceptance meal and a side of fries."
"RORY: Please, you have not accepted this."
"LORELAI: I am a grown woman. I do not need my mother's permission or blessing to be happy."
"LUKE: Must've been a good Oprah today."
"LORELAI: Just a little family drama. No biggie."
"RORY: It's a little biggie."
"LUKE: Yeah, what's going on?"
"LORELAI: I told my mother about me getting married and it was slightly ugly."
"LUKE: Yup."
"LORELAI: Yup, what?"
"LUKE: Well, there's nothing like a wedding to screw up a family."
"LORELAI: Actually, in my case, there's nothing like a family to screw up a family."
"LUKE: Something that's supposed to start nice, two people making promises to each other. I'll love you forever, I wanna die when you die, my life meant nothing until you used my toothbrush. And then it starts."
"LORELAI: Well, that's not exactly. ."
"LUKE: Who do you invite, who sits where, open bar, yes or no. . ."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: Auntie Junie doesn't eat chicken, Uncle Momo's off his meds."
"LORELAI: Junie and Momo?"
"LUKE: Just an example."
"LORELAI: Of a retired circus couple?"
"LUKE: And then after all that planning, the reception will still be a disaster because no matter what you do or how carefully you plan, halfway through one of those nauseating Bette Midler ballads, someone's getting drunk, someone's sleeping with someone else's wife, and someone's chicken kiev is landing on the cake."
"LORELAI: You know, the Gettysburg Address was only one page long, and that was about a w*r."
"LUKE: I just call them like I seem them."
"LORELAI: I have officially changed my order. I'll have the 'Luke's giving Lorelai a Migraine' meal."
"LUKE: Bleu cheese or ranch?"
"LORELAI: Both."
"LUKE: Coming right up."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is in the kitchen pouring coffee as Rory comes out of her room.]"
"RORY: Time?"
"LORELAI: 8:30."
"RORY: I'm late."
"LORELAI: Hold on, coffee!"
"RORY: Thanks. I'll see you tonight."
"LORELAI: Wait, one sec."
"RORY: Mom, I have to be there in twenty minutes."
"LORELAI: I know, but I made you something really cool."
"RORY: Can't it wait 'til tonight?"
"LORELAI: It won't be cool tonight."
"RORY: What do you mean it won't be cool tonight? What loses its cool factor in twelve hours?"
"LORELAI: This. [holds up a hammer decorated in pink]"
"RORY: What is that?"
"LORELAI: A hammer."
"RORY: It has feathers on it."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: So the rhinestones and bows won't feel lonely."
"RORY: What do you want me to do it?"
"LORELAI: Build a really pretty house."
"RORY: How long is it gonna take me to talk you out of giving that to me?"
"LORELAI: Forty minutes, an hour, tops."
"RORY: Hand it over."
"LORELAI: Call me when you get home, and please be careful."
"RORY: I will."
"LORELAI: I mean it Timmy, no falling down the well."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Rory opens front door. Lane is standing there with several boxes]"
"RORY: Oh, geez, you scared me."
"LANE: Sorry. Where you going?"
"RORY: I'm doing that Rebuilding Together thing today."
"LANE: Right. I'll be fast. [brings in the boxes] Okay. Here's my CD's, my 'zines, my posters, my books, three of your sweaters, and one Diva Glam lipstick. I need to leave them here while I'm in Korea because my mother's bound to search my room and if she finds them, she'll throw them out. And then spend the rest of the summer praying for my soul."
"RORY: I'll treat them like my own."
"LANE: Okay, now. This is the Lane Kim retrieval kit. It contains the phone number of my cousins in Korea, a map of the house I'll be staying at, a picture of me now, and a mock-up of me in 6 months."
"RORY: You've lost some weight."
"LANE: Now this is that name of that guy at the American Consulate, and several important Korean phrases written out phonetically, you know, 'Help', 'Have you seen this girl,' 'Comes from money', et cetera."
"RORY: Still no return date info from the parents?"
"LANE: Nope, but they did buy me a winter coat."
"RORY: When are you going?"
"LANE: Right after your mom's engagement par..."
"RORY: Shhhh!"
"LANE: Do you think she heard me?"
"RORY: I don't think so. No, she'd be in here grilling us for details if she had."
"LANE: She wouldn't have pretended not to have heard so she wouldn't k*ll the surprise?"
"RORY: And risk clashing with the decor?"
"LANE: Right. Okay, I gotta go."
"RORY: Hey, Henry?"
"LANE: Called him."
"RORY: And?"
"LANE: He likes me. He's perfect. I'll never see him again. You'll read about it in my novel, A Connecticut Yankee in Pusan. [leaves]"
"CUT TO FRONT YARD"
"[Rory walks out the front door as Dean walks up to the house.]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: Where you going?"
"RORY: I have to build a house."
"DEAN: Okay, so where you going?"
"RORY: I'm serious."
"DEAN: You're going to build a house?"
"RORY: It's for charity and I'm late, and why don't you go on inside and you and my mother can continue the 'Rory's building a house' routine and when that gets boring you can move on over to 'Who's on First?'"
"DEAN: Well, how long are you gonna be gone?"
"RORY: I don't know, why?"
"DEAN: I just thought we could hang today. Maybe see a movie, get something to eat. We could go to a bookstore, I'll watch you browse for six or seven hours."
"RORY: I would love to but I have to do this thing today."
"DEAN: Blow it off."
"RORY: I can't."
"DEAN: Did I mention the bookstore for six or seven hours?"
"RORY: How about tonight? We can get a pizza and go on Amazon. You'll be just as bored watching me ordering books, I promise."
"DEAN: Deal."
"RORY: Good, I have to go."
"CUT TO CONSTRUCTION SITE"
"[Rory taps on a man's shoulder while he's sawing a piece of wood.]"
"RORY: Excuse me."
"MAN: Hey, you're touching a man with a saw. You don't touch a man with a saw. What are you thinking?"
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"MAN: I could've hurt myself. I could've hurt you. There's a ton of hurt that almost happened here."
"RORY: I really am sorry. I've never been on a job site before. It's nice."
"MAN: Okay, where you from?"
"RORY: Chilton. My name. . ."
"MAN: Come on Chilton."
"RORY: No, it's Rory. Chilton's my school."
"MAN: You got a hammer?"
"RORY: Oh, yes, sir."
"MAN: Where is it?"
"[Rory takes out the decorated hammer and shows him]"
"RORY: It's a real hammer underneath."
"MAN: That's a hammer?"
"RORY: Well, it's just dressed up a little."
"MAN: You dressed up a hammer?"
"RORY: No, my mother did. She does that. She, um, she takes thinks that aren't pretty and makes them pretty, like a hammer, you know. One time she made individual outfits for my liquid paper bottles. A clown, a cowboy, a newscaster. She's not insane, she just sounds it."
"MAN: Okay. Work here. Wear these. Don't look up, pay attention to your surroundings, the words duck or run mean duck or run. Wear sunscreen, drunk water, get a button on the way out."
"RORY: That's it? That's the instructions?"
"MAN: Yup."
"RORY: But I've never done this before."
"MAN: Well, tomorrow you won't be able to say that."
"RORY: But people actually have to live in these houses. They may have kids or pets or breakables."
"MAN: If you get in trouble, ask the person next to you."
"ANOTHER MAN: Uh look out!"
"[Rory jumps back as a piece of wood falls next to her.]"
"MAN: Hey, you learn fast. I didn't even mention that one. [walks away]"
"[Rory starts to hammer a nail.]"
"PARIS: This is my wall."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: I've been working here. I put together this entire wall. Go work someplace else."
"RORY: You put together this wall?"
"PARIS: Go help with cement."
"RORY: It's very impressive."
"PARIS: I've done it a million times before. It's no big deal. Louise! What did I just tell you, use a grub axe for that!"
"LOUISE: Bite me!"
"RORY: Funny. I never pictured you as a Bob Vila kind of girl."
"PARIS: Rebuilding Together is an extremely prestigious and respected organization. I've been volunteering for them for years."
"RORY: Really? You just love the overalls?"
"PARIS: I don't. Harvard does."
"RORY: What does that mean?"
"PARIS: When you apply to an ivy league school, you need more than good grades and test scores to get you in. Every person who applies to Harvard has a perfect GPA and great test scores. It's the extras that put you over the top. The clubs, charities, volunteering. You know."
"RORY: Oh yeah, I know."
"PARIS: I started volunteering in fourth grade. I handed out cookies at the local children's hospital. By ten, I was leading my first study group. The youngest person in the group was twelve."
"RORY: Wow."
"PARIS: I've been a camp counselor. I organized a senior illiteracy program, I worked a su1c1de hotline, I manned a runaway center. I've adopted dolphins, taught sign language, trained seeing eye dogs."
"RORY: But when did you have time to have a life?"
"PARIS: I'll have a life after I graduate from Harvard. Now if you'll excuse me, the drainage on the south side of this place sucks."
"MADELINE: Hi!"
"PARIS: Madeline!"
"MADELINE: Bye!"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW BUSSTOP"
"[Dean is waiting on the bench as Rory steps off the bus.]"
"DEAN: Hey. You look good in dirt."
"RORY: Dean, hi."
"DEAN: So how was it?"
"RORY: Long day. Long long day."
"DEAN: The day is over. Let's talk about the night. Uh, there's a 7:30 showing of Barbarella, and I thought you can bring your mom's purse, you know the one with that monkey face and we'll sneak in some burgers and. . . what?"
"RORY: I can't."
"DEAN: Get your mom's purse?"
"RORY: I can't do anything tonight."
"DEAN: Why not?"
"RORY: Because I have a lot of planning to do."
"DEAN: What planning?"
"RORY: I'm like ten years behind on my extracurriculars."
"DEAN: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: Paris has been accumulating these things since she could walk. I mean, she has a list of good deeds that could bump Mother Teresa off the Harvard list."
"DEAN: Okay, I'm lost."
"RORY: I've been studying my butt off my whole life and I really thought that that was enough, but then Paris tells me that everyone makes good grades and it's the extras that put you over the top. And I thought that she was messing with me like she always does, but she's right. I mean, it makes total sense."
"DEAN: What does?"
"RORY: Good grades aren't enough. I need to do things. I need to volunteer. I need to work for charity, I need to help the blind, the orphans, I don't know. I just need to do something."
"DEAN: Fine, but what does this have to do with tonight?"
"RORY: I need to start now."
"DEAN: Now? You have to help the blind and the orphans now?"
"RORY: Didn't I tell you that I was ten years behind?"
"DEAN: Well you can't make up for ten years in one night Rory."
"RORY: I know. I just need to get organized."
"DEAN: Well, Rory, it's summer. I mean, summer's the time to hang out and kick back."
"RORY: I can't hang out or kick back. I need to find a retarded kid and teach him how to play softball. Oh God, listen to me. I am horrible. I am under qualified and horrible."
"DEAN: Wait a minute. I thought we were gonna spend some time together."
"RORY: We are."
"DEAN: When?"
"RORY: I don't know. Tomorrow maybe?"
"DEAN: You were busy today."
"RORY: I told you. . ."
"DEAN: So we made plans for tonight."
"RORY: Yes but. . ."
"DEAN: And now you're blowing me off again."
"RORY: I am not blowing you off."
"DEAN: You're going to summer school three days a week."
"RORY: You knew about that."
"DEAN: Yes, but we've been apart for awhile now and I figured you'd want to spend some time with me."
"RORY: Dean, this is about Harvard."
"DEAN: Oh, well excuse me, it's about Harvard, I forgot. Okay, fine."
"RORY: You're mad? You're mad because I want to be sure that I get into a good college?"
"DEAN: Nope, I'm mad because my girlfriend doesn't seem to have time for me anymore."
"RORY: Dean, stop it. This is important."
"DEAN: And it can't wait for one night?"
"RORY: No."
"DEAN: Fine."
"RORY: Why are you acting like this?"
"DEAN: Like what?"
"RORY: Like you're two."
"DEAN: Hey, I'm not going to Harvard, I could care less about Harvard. I just wanted to hang with you. But relax, since apparently I'm two, maybe I'll just grow out of it."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Rory's sitting at the kitchen table as Lorelai walks into the kitchen.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm officially way too tired to go out tonight so I'm not trusting my accessorizing instincts. Tell me what you think."
"RORY: I have no wilderness k*ll."
"LORELAI: So you hate the purse?"
"RORY: How am I supposed to get into Harvard if I have no wilderness k*ll?"
"LORELAI: I don't know honey. Maybe you'll have to give up your dream of majoring in logging."
"RORY: I called the Fireflies. Do they need troop leaders? Yes. Good, I'll be a troop leader. Great. The only catch is, it's summer. Camping season. I need wilderness k*ll. Why did you never take me camping?"
"LORELAI: Camping? Are you kidding? I couldn't get you to step on wet grass until you were three."
"RORY: If you had taken me camping, I'd have wilderness k*ll."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll tell you what. I'll take you upstairs. I'll throw you out the window. If you manage to grab that tree, I'll be your witness."
"RORY: I called the Sunnyside Home. Do they need any volunteers? And believe it or not, they don't, but they do need an accordion player for their Friday night polka party."
"LORELAI: How come I never forced you to learn the accordion?"
"RORY: The library was closed. I can call them tomorrow, but they only have twelve books so I'm not counting on that. The tutoring program at Chilton is still taking names. I guess I can do that but"
"LORELAI: Honey, calm down."
"RORY: I'm not prepared. I will never catch up."
"LORELAI: You will catch up, but not in one night. You've made your lists and your calls, why don't you relax and call Dean to come over?"
"RORY: We're in a fight."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because you never took me camping."
"LORELAI: Oh boy, I am really sucking tonight."
"RORY: We were supposed to hang out and I told him I couldn't and he got made and we're in a fight."
"LORELAI: Ugh. Well, listen, why don't I cancel on Max tonight and I'll hang out here with you. We can make popcorn and reminisce about how I never forced you to become a missionary."
"RORY: No, go, I'm fine. I just need to focus on this."
"LORELAI: Well, I can help."
"RORY: No, I need to do this alone."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"RORY: I'm sure."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I'm not gonna be home late. And listen, I would reconsider calling Dean. It's not his fault that you're so fabulous he can't think about anything else."
"RORY: Bye Mom."
"LORELAI: I mean, he just sits in his room, eating Froot Loops out of the box, saying your name over and over and over."
"RORY: Time is ticking."
"LORELAI: Rory, I love you Rory. Rory, I will not be ignored Rory"
"RORY: Leave."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll be home early. Bye."
"CUT TO RESTAURANT"
"[Max and Lorelai are eating dinner outside.]"
"MAX: You hate your dinner."
"LORELAI: No I don't."
"MAX: You've hardly touched it."
"LORELAI: Well, when somebody goes to all the trouble to make your entrée look like a little tiny hat, you hate to mess it up."
"MAX: Is something wrong?"
"LORELAI: No."
"MAX: You can tell me. That's what I'm here for."
"LORELAI: I thought it was just for eye candy."
"MAX: That too."
"LORELAI: I'm fine. It's just stuff, ya know. Rory's freaking out about not having enough extracurricular things to impress Harvard with."
"MAX: I can help her with that."
"LORELAI: I'm sure she would greatly appreciate it."
"MAX: Is that all that's wrong?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, just a lot of stuff to think about, you know, for the wedding."
"MAX: I forget to tell you, I saw my parents today. They just wanted me to tell you how thrilled they are. My mother cried twice. She said you don't have to call her mom but you're welcome to if you want."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"MAX: And then my father took me aside and gave me a long talk about marriage and the many ways of making a wife happy."
"LORELAI: Ooh, a dirty talk."
"MAX: Then they gave me this. [holds out a check]"
"LORELAI: No they did not."
"MAX: Yes they did too."
"LORELAI: Ah, did you tell them that we're paying for everything ourselves?"
"MAX: I did."
"LORELAI: Sookie's doing the cake, the ceremony's at my house, Patty's supplying the chairs thirty five dollars?"
"MAX: It's the first of four installments. That way we can't spend it all in one place."
"LORELAI: Oh, that is so cute!"
"MAX: They just want to be involved."
"LORELAI: That's sweet, that's really sweet. Can I. . .thanks."
"MAX: Oh, and my mother even offered you her wedding dress."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"MAX: But since three of you could fit into that dress I took the liberty of declining it."
"LORELAI: Oh, I hope she wasn't insulted."
"MAX: No, I just told her you were wearing your mother's dress."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"MAX: It doesn't matter whether you are or not, she just wanted to offer something."
"LORELAI: Let's get dessert."
"MAX: You okay?"
"LORELAI: I just think it's great. I think it's great that your parents are so happy and into everything. I. .that must be nice to have that."
"MAX: Well, why don't you think of it this way? Now they're kind of your parents too so you'll have that also."
"LORELAI: Yes, I will think of it like that. That is exactly how I will think of it."
"MAX: Good."
"LORELAI: Because otherwise, I'd have to look at it like Max has parents who love him and care about him, and I have parents."
"MAX: I didn't mean to upset you."
"LORELAI: I'm not upset. It's just, I can't get that one moment out of my mind. 'That's nice, I hope we're in town.' Who, who, who reacts like that? I mean, what sort of mind forms that reaction to 'Hey mom, I'm getting married'?"
"MAX: Well, from everything you've told me about your parents, there's so much baggage between you guys"
"LORELAI: You figure out a different way. You tap into compassion or family obligation or something. You don't react like that."
"MAX: I agree. It's wrong. But you can't change who they are, and you won't get anywhere trying to."
"LORELAI: Okay, you know what? I don't want to talk about my parents anymore. Okay, I don't want to speculate about them, I don't want to analyze them, I don't want to think about them anymore. We should go."
"MAX: Come on, it' still early. We'll go someplace else. Talk a little bit more?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Absolutely. Sounds good."
"CUT TO INSIDE MAX'S CAR"
"MAX: Listen, I'm sorry tonight brought up all these bad feelings for you."
"LORELAI: That's okay. Make a right."
"MAX: But I bet this was harder for your mother then you think it is."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"MAX: I mean, look what's happened to her over the last year. She was just getting back into your life, and suddenly, everything changes on her."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that's gotta suck. Go right."
"MAX: You know, maybe once we get married, things will settle down, you two will be able to work it out. I mean, you never know, I might be able to help the situation, ya know, uh, act as a buffer or so."
"LORELAI: That's a good thought, good thought. PullPull in here."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Max pull up out front and walk to the front door.]"
"MAX: Lorelai, hold on, ya know, I think I know what's going on here, and I gotta tell you, it's not a good idea."
"LORELAI: This'll just take a second. [rings doorbell several times]"
"MAX: I don't know, maybe you should wait until tomorrow, calm down a little, think this through, maybe you'll be able to be more objective."
"LORELAI: You are not asleep. Come on!"
"MAX: You are way too emotional for this."
"LORELAI: No, I'm just emotional enough. Now if you like you can wait in the car because I really don't plan on being here that long."
"[Emily opens the front door]"
"EMILY: What on earth?"
"LORELAI: Hi mom, do you have a sec to chat? Super."
"[Lorelai walks inside, Max waits inside by the door]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, what is this?"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to see how you were, that's all."
"EMILY: I'm fine."
"LORELAI: You are? Oh good, good. I'm glad that you're fine. I, however, am not fine."
"EMILY: Your father and I were just about to go to bed. We can do this in the morning."
"LORELAI: Actually Mom, no. We can't do this in the morning. We really need to do this right now."
"EMILY: Are you drunk?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not drunk. I'm confused."
"EMILY: About what?"
"LORELAI: About you."
"EMILY: And what about me confuses you Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Well, so many things. I mean, for example, why can't you keep a maid in this house? I mean, there must've been a thousand women who've gone through here in the thirty-two years that I've been alive, and not one of them could stick it out."
"EMILY: And this is what we need to discuss right now?"
"LORELAI: These are women from countries that have dictatorships and civil wars and death squads and all of that they survived, but five minutes working for Emily Gilmore, and people are begging for Castro."
"EMILY: All right, I'm going to bed now."
"LORELAI: And why is it that when your only daughter tells you that she is getting married, you can't muster up even a little enthusiasm? Even a little fake enthusiasm. Why don't you pretend that you care? I mean, this is the biggest thing to happen to me possibly for the rest of my life, and you dismissed it like I said, 'Hey, I'm thinking of getting a Honda, what do you think?'"
"EMILY: You're obviously hysterical!"
"LORELAI: Why don't you care? Why have you never cared? No matter what has happened to me my entire life, you've never been happy for me, and that hurts, Mom, it really hurts!"
"EMILY: I'm not discussing this with you."
"LORELAI: Do you know how it felt for me to tell you that I was getting married and to have you just brush it off like that? Do you know?"
"EMILY: No, I don't, I don't know! Possibly very similar to finding out from a complete stranger that my only daughter was getting married and had told every other person in the world before she bothered to tell her own mother. Possibly it felt something like that. Now if you'll excuse me, it is late, and I am going to bed. [opens the front door, Lorelai walks out]"
"MAX: Um, my parents would really like to have lunch with you and Mr. Gilmore, sometime. . . soon. Nice meeting you. [leaves]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie and Michel are at the front desk.]"
"MICHEL: I don't care."
"SOOKIE: I just need a quick opinion."
"MICHEL: It took me two seconds to tell you I don't care. That's as quick as I get."
"SOOKIE: This Lorelai's engagement party. It is a once in a lifetime event, and I want it to be perfect."
"MICHEL: I am working."
"SOOKIE: Just pick a cookie."
"MICHEL: I don't want to."
"SOOKIE: Michel, for the rest of their lives, Lorelai and Max are gonna think back on their engagement party and they're gonna talk about three things. They're gonna talk about the friends who came, and that special song they danced to, and the cookies that they ate."
"MICHEL: Their world is very small, isn't it?"
"SOOKIE: Macaroons or chocolate pralines?"
"MICHEL: Go back to the cooking room."
"SOOKIE: Not until you eat these and tell me what you think!"
"MICHEL: Sookie! I only eat fifteen hundred calories a day. If I eat that, I cannot have my Boca burger later."
"[Lorelai walks in.]"
"LORELAI: Hey Sookie. Is there any coffee left? I had a really lousy night."
"SOOKIE: Oh, sorry, ya know, I've been so busy I didn't even think about it."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's okay. I'll make some myself."
"SOOKIE: No! I'll make it! I'll make it! I wanna make it! I wanna make it! Let me do it! I wanna makehey, I make the coffee!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, relax, you're busy."
"SOOKIE: No, I'm not. Go back to the counter. Michel's stealing."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk through the door. The kitchen is filled with decorated cakes and baked goods.]"
"LORELAI: Oh my god. What is this?"
"SOOKIE: Uh, the dinner special?"
"LORELAI: The dinner special is a heart shaped pastry with Max and Lorelai written on it?"
"SOOKIE: I couldn't find any good salmon."
"LORELAI: Oh Sookie, you're throwing me a wedding shower, aren't you?"
"SOOKIE: It was supposed to be a surprise."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, this is amazing, Sookie, even for you."
"SOOKIE: Wait 'til you see the ice sculptures!"
"LORELAI: When is it?"
"SOOKIE: Tonight."
"LORELAI: Uh, so your yen to hit the bingo parlor in Enfield was. . ."
"SOOKIE: A vicious vicious lie."
"LORELAI: This is incredible. This is really really incredible. My God, is there any pink icing left on the planet?"
"SOOKIE: The whole town is in on it actually. It's gonna be quite the affair. I think you'll be sufficiently impressed with the amount of people that wanna celebrate this with you."
"LORELAI: Michel?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: Right. I, I just, I can't get over this. Ugh. Hey, you didn't by any chance invite my parents, did you?"
"SOOKIE: Actually, I did."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"SOOKIE: And at first, I was really torn because I know you have issues with them, but it is your wedding and I assumed you wanted them to be there. Oh no, your mother told you."
"LORELAI: Sort of."
"SOOKIE: Damn, I thought I mentioned that it was a surprise. I don't know, maybe I didn't. It would be so typical of me. Uh, the cat's already out of the bag, and I'm stuffing imported chocolate squares down my shirt so you don't see me walk into the kitchen with them. Hey, did your mother mention if they were coming? She never got back to me."
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah, no, um, she's got a thing tonight."
"SOOKIE: Oh, too bad. Hey, we can save her a piece of cake."
"LORELAI: That would be nice."
"CUT TO ENGAGEMENT PARTY"
"[In the center of a very decorated Stars Hollow, people are celebrating as Lorelai and Max sit surrounded by presents.]"
"KIRK: [on bullhorn] Attention guests, the buffet line is clogging at sector B. I repeat, sector B is moving too slow. Keep it moving people."
"[Rory walks up to the table where Lane is in charge of the party music.]"
"RORY: Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on."
"LANE: How's it sound?"
"RORY: Great."
"LANE: I'm trying to find that subtle blend between not too cliché sounding traditional tunes with out of left field, should be standard."
"RORY: Well, the Sinatra medley was great. I'd maybe skipped playing anything else by The Damned."
"LANE: Got it. What time is it?"
"RORY: It's eight. What time do you leave?"
"LANE: I have a 10 o'clock flight."
"RORY: Have I told you how much I'm gonna miss you?"
"LANE: Write me. Constantly."
"RORY: Everyday."
"LANE: Encouraging letters full of hope and see you soons."
"RORY: I'll be tying yellow ribbons around the old oak trees."
"LANE: I will be back for the wedding."
"RORY: You better be."
"LANE: Just don't let her change the date."
"RORY: Not going to happen. Max is teaching a summer course at the University of Toronto, so if you're back by the end of the summer, it'll be fine."
"LANE: Don't say if."
"RORY: Right."
"[Cut to Lorelai and Max]"
"MAX: I don't know if you've realized, but every gift so far has been for you."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, in this town, I am the queen. You are simply my jester."
"MAX: A position I happily accept."
"LORELAI: Aw, so come on then. How can you stand to leave all this for two months? Do you think Toronto's gonna make you into an ice sculpture? I don't think so."
"MAX: I wish you'd come with me."
"LORELAI: I have to work."
"MAX: Well, two months is a long time."
"LORELAI: I know."
"MAX: Will you still want me when I got back?"
"LORELAI: I think there's a very good possibility that I will be just as infatuated with you then as I am now."
"MAX: Maybe more."
"LORELAI: Maybe more."
"[cut to the gazebo, where young girls dressed as brides gather to perform a dance.]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, come on ladies, hurry up. Love waits for no one. Lucy, get off of Jenny's train! All right, bouquets up, and music!"
"[the girls start dancing. Kirk watches them as Rory walks over to him.]"
"RORY: How come you're not up there Kirk?"
"KIRK: Oh, I don't tap anymore. Bum knees."
"RORY: Ah."
"KIRK: I have to tell you, I'm a little worried about this gazebo holding up all those hoofers. They never did a trial run like I requested."
"RORY: Oh, I think it's okay. The studs are definitely sound, and the two by fours are a nice number two structural grade. Or better possibly. I built a house yesterday."
"KIRK: Oh, for Pete's sake! [on bullhorn] No tossing of the Jordan almonds. I repeat, put the almonds down!"
"[Kirk walks away as Dean walks over.]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: This is quite a party."
"RORY: Elegant and understated, just like my mother."
"DEAN: So, uh, how are you?"
"RORY: I'm fine, how are you?"
"DEAN: Me? Uh, I'm an idiot."
"RORY: No you're not."
"DEAN: I'm so sorry Rory."
"RORY: I'm sorry too."
"DEAN: I don't even know what happened."
"RORY: We had a fight, that's all."
"DEAN: I mean, I've just missed you and"
"RORY: I've missed you too."
"DEAN: I gotI don't know, I got jealous of Harvard for a minute, which is crazy 'cause I love the fact that you're gonna go to Harvard. And then you have to do something that's gonna help you get there, and II don't even, I don't even really understand it myself."
"RORY: Well, I didn't help. I was all wigged out when I got home."
"DEAN: Well, you had all the right to be."
"RORY: It's just that when it comes to Harvard, I sometimes get a little tunnel vision, and it's getting closer"
"DEAN: Whoa."
"RORY: and I have to think about it"
"DEAN: You do not have to explain."
"RORY: But I don't want you to feel unimportant, because believe me, you're not."
"DEAN: I'm glad."
"RORY: I mean it. The only way you could be more important to me is if you had a Kit Kat bar growing out of your head."
"DEAN: Well, I can't make any promises, but I'll give it a try."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"DEAN: Don't be. I mean, I'm not going to a fancy school. I don't have that kind of pressure. I can't even imagine what that must feel like."
"RORY: You could go to a fancy school if you wanted to."
"DEAN: I don't think so."
"RORY: Why not? You're smart."
"DEAN: No, you're smart."
"RORY: You are too."
"DEAN: Rory."
"RORY: And I could help you organize all of your extracurricular activities because I'm now an expert at it."
"DEAN: I don't"
"RORY: How are your wilderness k*ll?"
"DEAN: Hey?"
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: Do you accept my apology?"
"RORY: Yeah, I accept your apology."
"[cut to Lorelai and Max]"
"MAX: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. You know, I'll just um, I'll be right back."
"MAX: Okay."
"[cut to Kirk]"
"KIRK: [on bullhorn] Only three treats per person. No hogging of the treats. If caught with more than three treats on a plate, you will be faced with possible expulsion from said party."
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk. Can I see that for a sec?"
"KIRK: Oh, sure."
"LORELAI: Thanks. [walks away with bullhorn]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in. Luke is at the counter filling up ketchup bottles.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey. Why aren't you at your party?"
"LORELAI: Well that's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing."
"LUKE: Ah, well, I just got kinda busy here."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, I can see that. Boy they keep making that ketchup slower and slower, huh?"
"LUKE: It's the Heinz family's little joke."
"LORELAI: Boy, it's really pretty crazy out there."
"LUKE: Oh, I can imagine."
"LORELAI: Lots of people all having fun, just the kind of thing you'd hate."
"LUKE: Sounds awful"
"LORELAI: You'd be miserable."
"LUKE: Oh, yes I would."
"LORELAI: But in spite of all that, I was kind of thinking, and you don't have to, that maybe you could pull yourself away for a second."
"LUKE: Ah, well I"
"LORELAI: I mean, you know, finish the ketchup tonight, but maybe leave the worchestshire sauce for tomorrow."
"LUKE: I'll see how it goes."
"LORELAI: Okay. I mean, it's justit's a really big night for me tonight, and I don't know, it just feels like you should be there. Anyway, I'll let you get back to your ketchup. [leaves]"
"[cut to Sookie and Jackson at the party]"
"SOOKIE: The macaroons are going like hot cakes!"
"JACKSON: Yup, everything's a big success."
"SOOKIE: Look at all this, isn't it beautiful? I know it's cliché, but it is so romantic it makes you all giddy in a really sappy kind of way, doesn't it?"
"JACKSON: Uh, sure, I guess."
"SOOKIE: I hope they're happy. Ugh, what am I saying? How can they not be happy? They're in love, they have each other, and everything's perfect"
"JACKSON: Okay! I get it!"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, what are you"
"JACKSON: What do you think I need a piano to fall on my head?"
"SOOKIE: Well, I don't think anybody actually needs a piano to fall on their head."
"JACKSON: All the marriage talk, and the, 'Oh Jackson, you should see Lorelai's ring, it's so beautiful.'"
"SOOKIE: Well, it is."
"JACKSON: I understand. I'm hip, okay? We've hit that point in our relationship where the little hints are starting. Which means that'll be followed by the 'where are we going' talk, and that'll only end in a big ultimatum. Suddenly all hell breaks loose."
"SOOKIE: Okay, no more sugar for you."
"JACKSON: So, I think I need to say this right now. I'm not ready for marriage."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"JACKSON: However, I'd be willing to move in."
"SOOKIE: Move in where?"
"JACKSON: Move in with you."
"SOOKIE: [laughing] Jackson, you're hilarious!"
"JACKSON: I am?"
"SOOKIE: I'll move in with you. [laughs] What a riot!"
"JACKSON: Why are you laughing?"
"SOOKIE: [laughing] You're face! God, you're good. You are good."
"JACKSON: I wasn't joking."
"SOOKIE: [laughing] Come on, let's go get some punch."
"JACKSON: Sookie, I'm serious, I'm moving in."
"SOOKIE: [laughing] Jackson, stop, you're gonna give me a cramp!"
"JACKSON: Sookie, get back here!"
"[pan around the party to: Miss Patty dancing with Kirk, Rory and Dean sitting on a bench, Lane leaving for the airport, Lorelai and Max dancing, Luke coming to the party. Lorelai and Luke smile and wave at each other. Luke sits down on a bench next to three little girls dressed as brides, who all stare at him.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily sits at a table writing something as the doorbell rings.]"
"EMILY: Marina, the door please."
"[the maid answers the door. Lorelai walks in.]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Oh thanks. Hey mom. I was in the neighborhood, 'cause there's that wedding dress place on Willow. Elizabeth Taylor bought one of her dresses there. Anyhow, I was trying to make a decision about a veil, and I thought maybe you might have some opinion about which one would look best on me 'cause, well you know me, so um, I thought I'd stop by and ask you which one you thought would be good. On me. So, which one?"
"EMILY: You're quite capable of choosing that yourself Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"EMILY: All right, you're sorry."
"LORELAI: I don't know how to tell you things Mom. Um, I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but we don't communicate very well. When something good happens to me, I'm just afraid you're gonna make me feel bad about it. And when something bad happens to me, I'm always afraid you'll say 'I told you so.' I'm not sure if that's always fair, and I'm sure I share part of the blame for this circle we get into, but you think your words don't have any effect on me, but they do. And, I just didn't want to feel bad about this, so I waited. And I really didn't mean to hurt you. Okay, well, I will let you get back to that letter there."
"EMILY: Your head is much too big for a veil. You might consider a tiara."
"LORELAI: Um, a tiara?"
"EMILY: That's what I wore."
"LORELAI: Oh. Okay. Well, I'll think about that. [leaves]"

"[Lorelai and Rory are taste-testing cakes.]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, here!"
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: With a crunch and a zing and a hm hm hm hm, hello!"
"RORY: Okay, our house is burning down, and you can save the cake or me. What do you choose?"
"LORELAI: Well that's not fair. The cake doesn't have legs."
"FRAN: So how are we coming here?"
"LORELAI: Oh Fran, so good. This cake is amazing."
"RORY: Beyond amazing."
"FRAN: Well, I should hope so. We've been doing this for a 112 years."
"LORELAI: Huh. Well, you don't look a day over a 106."
"FRAN: No, I meant my family's been doing it for that long."
"LORELAI: Right. Okay, well, I'm glad we got that cleared up."
"RORY: The raspberry, the raspberry, the raspberry!"
"FRAN: So, when is the big day again?"
"LORELAI: Two weeks from tomorrow."
"FRAN: Have you picked a flavor?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. They're all so good."
"FRAN: Well you have to try them again."
"LORELAI: Oh no. I've already eaten so many."
"FRAN: This is a very crucial decision, young lady. Cake is the glue of the wedding, so you will stand here and eat until you decide."
"LORELAI: Okay, if you insist."
"FRAN: I do. After all, what's more important then your wedding day?"
"LORELAI: Well, it ain't Guy Fawkes day."
"FRAN: Yes, well, I'll just go and see if there's anything else in the back. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"RORY: So how was in seeing Max last night?"
"LORELAI: Well"
"RORY: No gory details."
"LORELAI: Like I've ever shared that part of my relationship with you."
"RORY: You've alluded, you've insinuated, you have tiptoed to the brink of impropriety."
"LORELAI: Hm, that Chilton has taught you some big words."
"RORY: That's kind of the point."
"LORELAI: It was really great. I'm glad he's back."
"RORY: And he's on board with the whole smallish wedding thing?"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. We want fun, we want simple, we want fast. We've been completely in sync, without the slightly gay boy band affiliation."
"RORY: Oh, I printed up some sample invitations for you. I made them on my computer"
"LORELAI: Aww."
"RORY: All you have to do is pick out a quote for the front page, and I'll print 'em up. [shows Lorelai the sample invitations]"
"LORELAI: Okay. Um ""What is love? It is the morning and the evening star."" Ugh."
"RORY: Sinclair Lewis."
"LORELAI: Sinclair Sappy Lewis."
"RORY: Fine, next."
"LORELAI: ""And all went merry as a marriage bell. But hush! Hark! A deep sound strikes like a rising knell!"" What is it with poetry?"
"RORY: Lord Byron."
"LORELAI: Byron and Lewis, together again."
"RORY: Okay, last one."
"LORELAI: ""We have buried the putrid corpse of liberty."" Perfect!"
"RORY: Mussolini it is. Um, can I ask you an ethical question?"
"LORELAI: Mmm."
"RORY: Is it right to be sampling wedding cakes when Sookie's making ours for free?"
"LORELAI: What is right anyway, you know? Who defines right? And if eating cake is wrong, I don't want to be right."
"FRAN: [calls] I'm bringing out a mocha crunch cream."
"LORELAI: So, ethics?"
"RORY: Highly subjective and completely overrated."
"LORELAI: That's my girl."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Max are in the living room talking to Kirk.]"
"KIRK: And here's a sample of some of my black and white shots."
"MAX: Hm."
"LORELAI: Wow Kirk, I didn't know you were into photography."
"KIRK: It's my passion."
"LORELAI: Have you ever sh*t a wedding before?"
"KIRK: Actually, this would be my first official wedding gig. Or photography gig, for that matter. But believe me, I've got the eye. And my Nikon is state of the art."
"MAX: Oh, I've got a Nikon too. It's an N64 with 3D matrix metering, 35 to 210 zoom. What have you got?"
"KIRK: It's a Nikon."
"LORELAI: I gotta tell you Kirk, these are really good for amateur shots."
"KIRK: Thanks. That's me and my parents on vacation in the Berkshires."
"MAX: Hm, nice looking family."
"KIRK: And those are some self-portraits."
"LORELAI: Aahh! Kirk, you're nude!"
"KIRK: No no, I'm wearing Speedos. They're kind of flesh colored."
"MAX: Wait a minute. I recognize this."
"KIRK: Nice photo, huh?"
"MAX: This is VJ Day, New York, 1945."
"KIRK: Right. I include it as an example of the excellence that I aspire to."
"LORELAI: How much for your services?"
"KIRK: How about a hundred and fifty an hour?"
"LORELAI: How about lunch and the cost of the film?"
"KIRK: You won't be sorry."
"LORELAI: Done."
"KIRK: I thank you."
"LORELAI: Bye. [Kirk leaves]"
"MAX: Oh, uh, what time is it?"
"LORELAI: Ten"
"MAX: Ten of?"
"LORELAI: Three."
"MAX: I have to go."
"LORELAI: No!"
"MAX: I have to."
"LORELAI: You're always going."
"MAX: Well, luckily that'll all change soon."
"LORELAI: Yes it will. Two weeks from now you won't have to get going 'cause it's here you'll be going. To. Going or going to?"
"MAX: I'd add the to."
"LORELAI: Hm. Going to. You make me smarter."
"MAX: Hm, well, I am a teacher."
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, don't. Stay longer."
"MAX: I can't."
"LORELAI: Take me upstairs and see if you can get me into Mensa."
"MAX: It's gonna take me forever to get back into the city, and I gotta get up early to let the painters in."
"LORELAI: Hey, do you have to be there while they work?"
"MAX: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: Well, isn't your apartment gonna be all paint fumey?"
"MAX: Yeah, so?"
"LORELAI: So, maybe you should stay here."
"MAX: Here?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Instead of driving back and forth all weekend, sleep over. I mean, it's gonna be your place too soon enough. Look at it like a trial run."
"MAX: A trial run."
"LORELAI: It'll be fun."
"MAX: You think you're ready for me?"
"LORELAI: I'm always ready for you."
"MAX: Full time?"
"LORELAI: I insist."
"MAX: He was not wearing Speedos."
"LORELAI: Ugh, don't talk about the photo."
"MAX: The man was buck naked."
"LORELAI: Offer rescinded if this line of conversation proceeds."
"MAX: I'll be back."
"LORELAI: Bye hon."

"DEAN: So, what are we doing tonight?"
"RORY: I'll do whatever."
"DEAN: Well, what movies haven't we seen?"
"RORY: We haven't seen just about all of them."
"DEAN: Yeah, they all stink this year."
"RORY: They definitely do underestimate our intelligence."
"DEAN: Plus they stink."
"RORY: There are at least five of them featuring someone doing something disgusting with a cow."
"DEAN: Yeah. I mean, they should at least do something disgusting with a different animal."
"RORY: We can watch ""Holy Grail"" on tape again."
"DEAN: Okay, but I am not talking in an English accent for the rest of the evening."
"RORY: No fun. Hey, tomorrow night?"
"DEAN: ""Life of Brian?"""
"RORY: Max is staying over."
"DEAN: Really?"
"RORY: First time. And to kind of celebrate, he and my mom wanted to go on a double date."
"DEAN: But tomorrow's our anniversary."
"RORY: No it's not, it's on the twenty-fourth."
"DEAN: No, that was our old anniversary. We broke up and got back together on the sixth. So using the twenty-fourth wouldn't be an accurate account of how long we've been together."
"RORY: Unless you consider our time apart as a temporary moratorium on our relationship. You know, like the time kept passing, and we were on a sabbatical."
"DEAN: Yeah, it's complicated."
"RORY: Very."
"DEAN: So a double date, with adults?"
"RORY: No, just with Mom and Max."
"DEAN: What'll it be, like dinner and dancing?"
"RORY: Yes, and then we'll enjoy brandy and cigars. No, we'll probably just grab a bite."
"DEAN: All right, we can do that."
"RORY: Hey, let's have two anniversaries. We can celebrate twice a month. They're well spread apart, the sixth and the twenty-fourth."
"DEAN: We can't do that."
"RORY: Who's gonna stop us?"
"DEAN: Twice a month?"
"RORY: Dare to be different."
"DEAN: Twice a month it is."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Max is cooking dinner while Lorelai sits at the table.]"
"LORELAI: Why won't you let me help?"
"MAX: Because you're a danger to the process."
"LORELAI: That's not true!"
"MAX: I've got numerous scars."
"LORELAI: I cut you that onetwo times, and I've helped you tons of times."
"MAX: You helped me twice and both time you cut me."
"LORELAI: Well, I do like watching you cook."
"MAX: I like you watching me cook."
"RORY: [walking into kitchen] What's that weird smell?"
"LORELAI: It's food!"
"MAX: It smells weird?"
"RORY: No, just weird for this house. It smells great."
"MAX: Rory, could you get that?"
"RORY: What?"
"MAX: Uh, right down there. Uh, shiny handle."
"[Rory opens the broiler]"
"LORELAI: Ugh! Did you know we had that?"
"RORY: Not a clue."
"MAX: Oh come on."
"LORELAI: Hey, it's on fire!"
"MAX: It's the broiler."
"RORY: Wow."
"MAX: What fallout shelter have you guys been living in?"
"RORY: He has much knowledge."
"LORELAI: We shall form a cult around him."
"RORY: Build a statue many stories high."
"LORELAI: We shall grow our hair long and stop bathing."
"MAX: Please, don't do any of that."
"RORY: Are we eating at the table?"
"MAX: Wherever you want."
"LORELAI: TV?"
"RORY: I'll get a tape."
"LORELAI: Can I at least grab some dishes?"
"MAX: Far away from me."
"LORELAI: Alarmist."
"CUT TO LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the floor, Max is sitting on the couch, all are watching a movie.]"
"TV: 'You don't learn very fast Injun.'"
"LORELAI: How fast do you learn Billy Jack?"
"TV: 'Fast enough.'"
"RORY: Billy Jack, I'm gonna k*ll you if it's the last thing I do."
"LORELAI: Ugh, he so jinxed himself with that one."
"RORY: Yeah, he should've said 'Billy Jack, I'm gonna k*ll you or buy myself a lovely chenille sweater.'"
"LORELAI: Ooh, yeah, either way he wins."
"MAX: How many times have you seen this movie?"
"LORELAI: I'm out of digits."
"RORY: You can't see a Billy Jack movie too many times."
"MAX: Who's the guy Billy Jack's. . ."
"LORELAI: Shh shh shh!"
"TV: 'All right you cats. Very slowly now.'"
"LORELAI: Let's do some jumping jacks."
"TV: 'Spread out. One.'"
"RORY: Oh it's the counting part."
"TV: 'He means it Daniel.' 'Two.'"
"LORELAI: Ooh, here comes my favorite and my least favorite line all rolled into one."
"TV: 'I'm gonna cut your bowels out.'"
"LORELAI: Ughughugh."
"RORY: Ahh, yuck!"
"TV: 'Three.'"
"LORELAI: Ooh, comeuppance time!"
"MAX: You guys talk throughout the whole movie and then when I say something, you shush me."
"LORELAI: That's because you're talking through parts we talked through last time, so we haven't seen those parts in awhile."
"MAX: Ah, well now it's clear."
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Max?"
"MAX: What? The phone?"
"LORELAI: Whoever's closest answers."
"RORY: House rule."
"MAX: You're both closer."
"LORELAI: Oh, but I'd have to walk around the coffee table so my path would be farther."
"RORY: And my foot's asleep."
"LORELAI: Plus you're taller."
"RORY: With longer legs."
"LORELAI: Yes, so even if we all left for the phone at exactly the same time"
"MAX: I got it. [goes to answer phone]"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna like having him around."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE LATER THAT NIGHT"
"[Lorelai and Rory are still on the floor. Max is asleep on the couch.]"
"LORELAI: You want a refill?"
"RORY: Sure, same thing."
"LORELAI: Max?"
"RORY: Uh oh."
"LORELAI: We wore him out."
"RORY: We tend to do that."
"LORELAI: Well, we are ElectraWoman and DynaGirl."
"MAX: ElectraWoman."
"RORY: I think it's time to turn in."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"MAX: I'm awake."
"RORY: You don't look it."
"MAX: No, I am. I'm just waiting for the guy with the thing on the"
"RORY: Mom, get him to bed."
"LORELAI: Yeah, okay. Come on hon."
"MAX: What happened to Billy Jack?"
"LORELAI: I'll explain it to you later."
"RORY: Goodnight."
"LORELAI: Goodnight."
"MAX: Goodnight."
"LORELAI: [whispers] Is this weird?"
"RORY: [shrugs]"
"PAN OVER LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Max is asleep while Lorelai lay awake staring at the ceiling.]"
"CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory is sleeping. Lorelai walks in and sits on her bed.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: What? What is it?"
"LORELAI: Oh nothing. Whatcha doing?"
"RORY: Taking back Poland."
"LORELAI: Oh, good luck with that."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I have a boy in my room"
"RORY: So?"
"LORELAI: So I have a boy in my room."
"RORY: It's Max."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: You like Max."
"LORELAI: No, uhh, yes, I do, but it's weird. We've never had a man in the house like this up there."
"RORY: He's your fiancé."
"LORELAI: Very true."
"RORY: So all you need to do is adjust. It's like that time you got the green stripes in your hair."
"LORELAI: I hated those green stripes."
"RORY: Well, I'm tired. I can think of a better example tomorrow."
"LORELAI: No, wake up, wake up. We've not properly talked about this."
"RORY: About what?"
"LORELAI: About having Max in the house. About the effect on you. Don't cover up anything. Let's get it all out in the open."
"RORY: I don't have anything to cover up. I like Max."
"LORELAI: I know you do, and that's good. But you know, once we are married, nothing will ever be the same again."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: It won't just be the 'me and you secret special clubhouse no boys allowed' thing anymore."
"RORY: It will be different."
"LORELAI: Not just different. Our lives as we know them will be over."
"RORY: Mom, we're not dying."
"LORELAI: No, we're not dying. But the life we had is gonna morph into this like mutation that we could never possibly have conceived."
"RORY: Like the giant ants in ""Them""?"
"LORELAI: Metaphorically speaking, yes. And I don't want it to be like giant ants, so that's why I'm talking about it now."
"RORY: I am in no way anticipating being attacked by giant man-eating ants because Max is living here."
"LORELAI: Good. Good."
"RORY: Weirdo."
"LORELAI: You know, you can't walk around in the buff anymore."
"RORY: I don't remember ever walking around in the buff."
"LORELAI: I know one time you did."
"RORY: Was I three?"
"LORELAI: Somewhere around there."
"RORY: Does he hog the bed?"
"LORELAI: No. He's a very 'stay on his side' kinda guy."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: He's cute. He wears pajama bottoms."
"RORY: Stop."
"LORELAI: Not funny ones. I hate funny bottoms."
"RORY: I'm gonna call you Funny Bottoms from now on."
"LORELAI: Nuh uh!"
"RORY: Aren't you happy?"
"LORELAI: Yes. I'm happy."
"RORY: Well, then it'll be fine. You'll get used to it, having Max there."
"LORELAI: I know. You're right. I will. I will get used to it. [closes her eys]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Hm?"
"RORY: You're falling asleep."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: You need to be a big girl and go to your own room."
"LORELAI: Okay. [pretends she can't get up] Uh, uh..."
"RORY: Fine, ten more minutes"
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is walking around serving coffee.]"
"LUKE: More?"
"TAYLOR: Absotivalutely."
"LUKE: What's up Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Up, I know of nothing up."
"LUKE: What's up Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: I'm just happy."
"LUKE: That's what makes me nervous."
"TAYLOR: You're a paranoid man Luke. I feel very sad for you."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in.]"
"LUKE: Over there."
"LORELAI: Uh, can you clear that one off?"
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: 'Cause it's bigger."
"LUKE: So."
"LORELAI: Well, we're three today."
"LUKE: Three?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Max is with us."
"LUKE: Max, huh? So when did Max become invisible to the human eye?"
"LORELAI: He's on a paper hunt."
"RORY: Max likes his three papers in the morning. The Hartford Courant, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal."
"LUKE: Three papers."
"LORELAI: He likes to be well informed."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, reading three papers all reporting the same news is a terrific use of trees."
"LORELAI: You be nice Luke, I mean it."
"[Max walks into the diner]"
"MAX: Hey there."
"LUKE: Max, buddy, top of the morning to you! Hey, you look good today. Brown is your color, my friend."
"MAX: Thanks."
"LORELAI: So?"
"MAX: I got two out of three."
"RORY: Not bad"
"MAX: No one has the Wall Street Journal."
"RORY: Well this isn't a very financially oriented town."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's more oriented to coffee."
"LUKE: I've got the blueberry pancakes this morning."
"LORELAI: Bring 'em."
"RORY: Bring 'em twice."
"LUKE: And you?"
"MAX: I'm gonna need a minute."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, then, hold off."
"RORY: Same here."
"LUKE: I might run out of the pancakes."
"MAX: Go ahead, order. I'll just be a minute."
"LORELAI: No that's okay. We'll wait."
"LUKE: I'm almost out and I can't make more."
"LORELAI: Set some aside."
"LUKE: It's first come, first serve."
"RORY: We'll take our chances."
"LORELAI: Yes, we'll wait."
"LUKE: Whatever. [walks away]"
"MAX: You didn't need to do that."
"LORELAI: Aww, happy to."
"[Max reads over the menu while Rory and Lorelai watch him.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, yeah, that's still eggs and all your basic breakfast stuff up there."
"MAX: Just order."
"RORY: We're fine."
"MAX: I want you guys to go at your normal pace. My rhythm might not necessarily be your rhythm. [Luke walks over, hands Max another menu] What's this?"
"LUKE: It's the lunch menu. I stop serving breakfast in an hour."
"LORELAI: Luke."
"MAX: I'll have poached eggs."
"LORELAI: And blueberry pancakes!"
"RORY: Did we make it?!"
"LUKE: I already set 'em aside."
"LORELAI: Love ya!"
"[Luke notices a work crew outside.]"
"LUKE: What the hell they doing out there?"
"TAYLOR: What? Who is that?"
"LUKE: What are they doing Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Looks like they're coning off the street."
"LUKE: Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Well, if you must know, they are a county work crew here to install Stars Hollow's first traffic light and metered crosswalk. [Luke rushes outside] Luke!"
"LUKE: [to work crew] Hold it!"
"TAYLOR: [to work crew] Keep going. [to Luke] You have no controlling legal authority over this matter."
"LUKE: Stuff it Taylor. Hold it!"
"TAYLOR: Keep going. And I will not stuff it."
"LUKE: What authority did you have to authorize this? You're supposed to inform local business owners of major projects per the town's rules, meaning me."
"TAYLOR: Not when it's a matter of dire public safety, where the city charter clearly states that I can function unilaterally in the town's best interest."
"LUKE: Dire public safety! We haven't had an accident here in ten years!"
"TAYLOR: You can't stop progress Luke."
"[Taylor walks away. Lorelai comes out of the diner.]"
"LORELAI: Traffic light, huh?"
"LUKE: It's unbelievable."
"LORELAI: Well, it can always be taken outwith your bare hands or your teeth."
"LUKE: Yeah, I guess."
"LORELAI: Hey, did you get my invitation?"
"LUKE: The what?"
"LORELAI: My wedding invitation for my wedding 'cause I'm wedding Max."
"LUKE: Oh yeah, yeah. It's in a pile upstairs somewhere."
"LORELAI: Good, good. So are you coming?"
"LUKE: You know, I gotta make some calls about this thing before it's too late. I'll see you later."
"LORELAI: Okay. Uh"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[It's nighttime. Lorelai, Rory, Max, and Dean are walking along the sidewalk.]"
"MAX: Ugh, I can barely walk."
"LORELAI: Bad shoes?"
"MAX: I ate a cow."
"LORELAI: You had a steak."
"MAX: Plus the sides. Four people, six baked potatoes."
"LORELAI: Uh, you always exaggerate."
"MAX: Am I exaggerating?"
"DEAN: Nope."
"RORY: Ooh, ice cream! [runs off]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, I'm right behind you! [runs off]"
"MAX: How can they possibly eat more?"
"DEAN: Kind of surprised."
"MAX: I know. They're bottomless pits."
"DEAN: I mean at you. You've known them long enough not to be so confused."
"[They both sit on a bench.]"
"MAX: Oh, I'm not confused. I'm just . . . what do you mean?"
"DEAN: Their eating habits are just the start of what you're gonna have to get used to. There's tons of stuff you should be aware of."
"MAX: Really?"
"DEAN: Oh yeah. Like, don't ever use the last of the parmesan cheese. And never get into a heavy discussion late at night 'cause that's when they're at their crankiest. Oh, and uh, go with their bits."
"MAX: Their bits?"
"DEAN: Yeah, like, if you're eating pizza with them and Lorelai decides that the pepperoni is angry at the mushrooms because the mushrooms have an attitude and then she holds up a pepperoni and the pepperoni asks for your opinion...don't just laugh. Answer the pepperoni."
"MAX: Answer the pepperoni."
"DEAN: And don't let them near puppies 'cause they'll want to take home every one."
"MAX: Oh, that one I knew."
"DEAN: Oh, and uh, here's a big one. If you ever think that they're doing something crazy, they're not. You see, after a while, their thinking becomes clear, but by the time it's clear, they've already done two other totally crazy things that you can't figure out. So there's no catching up."
"MAX: You have much knowledge."
"DEAN: You got that from Rory."
"MAX: Right."
"DEAN: Oh, and hey, does Lorelai know what kind of ice cream you like?"
"MAX: Yeah, chocolate chip. But I already told her that I"
"LORELAI: Hey, chocolate chip. [hands him an ice cream cone]"
"MAX: Thanks."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT PORCH"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Max, and Dean walk up to Lorelai's house.]"
"LORELAI: Ugh, I'm so full. Why'd you let me eat so much?"
"DEAN: Yeah, they'll blame you."
"[Lorelai goes inside]"
"MAX: It's past eleven guys."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Max goes inside]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is lying on her bed. Max walks into the room.]"
"LORELAI: Mm."
"MAX: How ya doing?"
"LORELAI: Mm, I'm stable."
"MAX: You're a lovely shade of puce."
"LORELAI: Don't say puce. It sounds too much like another word I don't wanna hear right now."
"MAX: Sorry. You know they're still outside."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"MAX: Rory and Dean."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"MAX: How long you think they'll be out there?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"MAX: So there's no time limit or anything?"
"LORELAI: Yes. As soon as they both get tired of saying 'No, you're prettier' to each other, then the night's over."
"MAX: Lorelai, come on."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MAX: Well, I'm gonna be living here soon."
"LORELAI: I know that."
"MAX: So I just thought I should know what the procedure is when stuff like this comes up."
"LORELAI: Stuff like what?"
"MAX: Say you're not here, I come home, there's Rory and Dean in the dark all alone after eleven. I mean, how do I handle stuff like that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Max, Rory is very low maintenance. Kind of like that robot kid in A.I., only way less mother-obsessed. Oh my God, that kid was so annoying. I would've pushed him out of the car while it was still moving."
"MAX: Well, what if I catch them one night making out on the couch?"
"LORELAI: Ummwell, turn off the light?"
"MAX: You're not being serious."
"LORELAI: Max, they're teenagers. They can kiss a little bit."
"MAX: Okay, well, what do I do if Rory comes home drunk?"
"LORELAI: Come on!"
"MAX: It happens."
"LORELAI: Not to Rory it doesn't."
"MAX: I know. But theoretically, just in a make believe world, if she did, what would I do?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"MAX: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: No, you would do nothing. I would handle it."
"MAX: So basically, I have no role in Rory's life."
"LORELAI: Max, Rory's done. She's brought up, she's Rory. You don't need a role."
"MAX: Fine."
"LORELAI: I don't see the problem here."
"MAX: Clearly. So, I should do nothing around here ever."
"LORELAI: No, not nothing ever."
"MAX: What then?"
"LORELAI: Well, making the garlic bread the other night was really good."
"MAX: So other than making the garlic bread and answering the phone, what else is my role around here?"
"LORELAI: Well, you're my fella. You're my guy, you're my old man."
"MAX: What does that entail?"
"LORELAI: All things dirty."
"MAX: I'm not joking here. We're getting married Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I know."
"MAX: Well, that means we're taking two separate lives and melding them together. I mean, how do you think that's gonna work?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"MAX: Well, have you given it any thought at all?"
"LORELAI: Not really. No, II mean, but I will! But II'll start now."
"MAX: How would you feel if I told you I haven't thought about our future at all?"
"LORELAI: Terrible, I would feel terrible, I'm sorry. I mean it, I'm sorry. Please come here. Remember, it's all those little annoying quirks that make me the fascinating woman you fell in love with. Hmm? [they kiss]"
"MAX: Really not fair."
"LORELAI: I've got a lingerie drawer full of not fair, mister."
"MAX: Okay. I mean, we didn't need to get into this tonight. I definitely broke Dean's late night cranky rule."
"LORELAI: Who's what?"
"MAX: Nothing."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S DINER"
"[A crowd is standing around the new traffic light.]"
"TAYLOR: Welcome townspeople! I [crumbled up piece of paper hits him in the head] So you're gonna spoil it for all of us right off the bat, huh Luke?"
"LUKE: Why waste time?"
"SOOKIE: What about dinner?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you don't eat dinner at a bachelorette party."
"SOOKIE: You gotta eat."
"LORELAI: No, you gotta drink, dance, party and drink some more."
"SOOKIE: We'll all hurl before the night's half over."
"TAYLOR: This is all very fascinating."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry Teach. We'll keep it down."
"TAYLOR: How about keeping it silent?"
"LORELAI: [whispers] Way down."
"TAYLOR: Or zipping it shut?"
"LORELAI: [in high voice] Little tiny mice voices."
"TAYLOR: Townspeople, we should all be proud of the new addition to our streets. I know many of you have wanted a traffic light and a crosswalk for many years"
"LUKE: What?"
"TAYLOR: and now, your dream has come true."
"LUKE: It's like h*tler's Germany."
"TAYLOR: Luke!"
"LUKE: You're trying to brainwash us, Taylor. Telling us we want something that we don't and not giving us any choice."
"LORELAI: Luke, shish! We're planning."
"LUKE: I heard, and you're idiots if you don't eat first."
"TAYLOR: Everybody, let me segue into the informational portion of our gathering. If I can turn your attention to the pole here, you will see a yellow button with an instructional panel right above it."
"MISS PATTY: Oh my God. That's the biggest yellow button I've ever seen."
"TAYLOR: Now if you'll read the panel above the button, you'll learn how the system works."
"MISS PATTY: 'To cross street, push yellow button, wait for walk signal. When signal reads walk, step into street and proceed to the other side.'"
"LUKE: It's written for morons."
"BABETTE: In big stupid letters too!"
"MOREY: I hate being infantalized."
"TAYLOR: Does no one here care about this fate of near accidents we have suffered over the past year?"
"LUKE: Near accidents. Meaning they didn't happen."
"TAYLOR: Just because they didn't happen doesn't mean that we shouldn't ward against them."
"LUKE: There's lots of things that don't happen that we don't ward against."
"TAYLOR: Like?"
"LUKE: Like everything."
"TAYLOR: So that everything doesn't happen here, meaning nothing happens?"
"LUKE: No, it's not nothing happens. Stuff happens. It's that itit's not everything that'sit'sDammit Taylor!"
"TAYLOR: Ha! Now, for some interesting stats[voice fades into background]"
"LORELAI: So let's see. That's you, me, Miss Patty, Rory, Babette. Babette, you're coming right?"
"BABETTE: Doll, I'm sorry. I'm not gonna be able to make it."
"LORELAI: Babette, no."
"BABETTE: We're having Morey's parents over for dinner, and if you cancel on 'em last minute, they'll stick a red-hot poker up your 'you know where'."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, we'll miss you."
"BABETTE: Yeah, well stick your hand down the front of some guy's pants for me, would ya?"
"LORELAI: I hope you're talking about a stripper."
"BABETTE: Whatever."
"TAYLOR: Now the length of the walk signal's duration has thoughtfully been timed to accommodate the pace of Stars Hollow's oldest living resident. So, to inaugurate the signal, our beloved Mrs. Lanahan is going to push the button and lead the first historic group across the street. Ready with the camera Kirk?"
"KIRK: Rolling. [starts taking pictures]"
"MISS PATTY: Uh, the cap is still on the lens, dear."
"KIRK: Oh thanks."
"LORELAI: I'm not wearing a veil at the party."
"SOOKIE: But the bride always wears a veil at the bachelorette party."
"LORELAI: I'm not wearing a veil at the wedding."
"SOOKIE: You're not? I love veils!"
"LORELAI: Nah, we're going cas Sook."
"SOOKIE: But it's a big day, you gotta have some pomp."
"LUKE: You should elope and get it over with."
"SOOKIE: No one asked you."
"LORELAI: Believe me, eloping was not out of the question."
"SOOKIE: But you don't get a wedding over with."
"LUKE: Why not? It's a bureaucratic civil ceremony, a pretty pointless one."
"SOOKIE: Agh! Don't listen to him."
"LORELAI: Ah, he's just being Luke"
"LUKE: It's not biologically natural for people to mate for life. Animals don't mate for life. Well, ducks do, but who the hell cares what ducks do?"
"LORELAI: Luke."
"LUKE: I mean, people grow and evolve their whole lives. The chances that you're gonna grow and evolve at the same rate as someone else...too slim to take. The minute you say 'I do', you're sticking yourself in a tiny little box for the rest of your life. But hey, at least you had a party first, right?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, I'm tired of you now. We're gonna finish this conversation away from Crotchety Guy. [Sookie pulls Lorelai away]"

"CUT TO OUTSIDE NIGHT CLUB"
"[Lorelai, Sookie, Rory, Miss Patty, and Michel are standing in line outside a night club.]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, this place looks like fun!"
"RORY: They're never gonna let me in."
"LORELAI: They will let you in."
"MICHEL: This is a felony, you know, corrupting a minor. We'll all end up in the bookie."
"RORY: He's right. We're all going to the bookie."
"LORELAI: Sweetie, don't say bookie. It's creepy."
"SOOKIE: Just try to look older."
"RORY: How?"
"SOOKIE: Look like you're thinking about retirements or 401Ks and stuff."
"MICHEL: Yes, you should've brought your fake beard and mustache."
"LORELAI: Who invited Mister Schnickelfritz?"
"SOOKIE: He heard us planning and wanted to come."
"MICHEL: I did not know the evening included babysitting."
"LORELAI: She's going to get in. [cell phone rings] Sorry. Hey!"
"MAX: So my bachelor party's come to a screeching halt."
"LORELAI: What? Why?"
"MAX: There's been an accident. I'm fine, but we're at the hospital."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, what happened?"
"MAX: We're coming out of the restaurant and we're heading toward our next stop when my brother decides to leap frog over a parking meter."
"LORELAI: Why did he do that?"
"MAX: Middle child."
"LORELAI: Poor Jan."
"MAX: Anyway, he didn't make it."
"LORELAI: Ugh. Ouch. How drunk was he?"
"MAX: He claims he wasn't drunk. He's saying that the parking meters in Hartford are taller then the parking meters in Deluth so he just miscalculated."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"MAX: Yup."
"MAX'S BROTHER: I've got a concussion. I'm good. Let's drink."
"MAX: Hold on a second. You got a concussion?"
"MAX'S BROTHER: Yeah, it's a little one"
"LORELAI: What is he saying?"
"MAX: It's a mild concussion. We're gonna take him home."
"LORELAI: All right, well take him home, and then go hit a strip club."
"MAX: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: I am telling you, this is your last chance to look at another woman's breastage."
"MAX: Point well taken. I'll call you tomorrow. [they hang up]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, new rule for the evening. No calls to fiancés or boyfriends or anything else like that. It's girls' night out. Plus Michel."
"[They reach the club entrance]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"BOUNCER: It's twelve bucks. And it's eighteen and over."
"SOOKIE: Oh, she's eighteen."
"RORY: That's right. Last week. So it's a new eighteen, but it's eighteen, yup."
"BOUNCER: You got some ID?"
"LORELAI: Hey, uh, sir, make way for Rory. That's her name. And her only name. Rory. Single name, she's that important. Internationally known international supermodel and sometimes spokesperson for international products."
"SOOKIE: She's very big in Germany."
"LORELAI: Yah, yah, yah, with the leichter hosen and such."
"BOUNCER: Twelve bucks."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"SOOKIE: Danke shane, cutie."
"CUT TO INSIDE CLUB"
"MICHEL: This is a drag club."
"SOOKIE: It's called the Queen Victoria. What did you expect, tea and crumpets?"
"LORELAI: Aw, you guys, I guess we're gonna have to stand."
"SOOKIE: Wait, that one looks open."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"[They walk towards the table. Emily is sitting there.]"
"SOOKIE: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: What in Lucifer's reach is my mother doing here?"
"MICHEL: Oh, I invited her."
"LORELAI: You what?"
"MICHEL: Just a little surprise for you. I thought it would be a kick."
"[They walk over to Emily.]"
"LORELAI: Excuse me sir, you look just like my mother."
"RORY: Hi Grandma. Come here often?"
"EMILY: I should say not. How did you get in?"
"RORY: Oh, apparently, I'm an internationally known supermodel."
"EMILY: Happy bachelorette party, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Thank you Mother."
"EMILY: And in the future, when you plan one of these things, and you tell a person to show up at eight o'clock, it is considered good manners for you to also show up at eight o'clock."
"LORELAI: Well, I didn't exactly invite you mother, Michel did."
"EMILY: Ah, well, I feel much better now."
"LORELAI: Huh, let's drink."
"MISS PATTY: Looks like Emily's gotten a head start. What are you drinking honey?"
"EMILY: Manhattan. Good too. Not too sweet. I ordered it from that nice fellow dressed as Joan Crawford."
"MICHEL: So, is there no dancing here? I was hoping there'd be dancing."
"SOOKIE: You need to strut Tony Minero?"
"MICHEL: It is a weekend and on the weekend I like to move, and the ladies, they like it too."
"LORELAI: Especially when you move out of town. Ba zing!"
"EMILY: Has she eaten?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah. About a quart of wine."
"[A waitress comes to the table]"
"LORELAI: Hmm, hi Mae West."
"WAITRESS: What can I get for you?"
"MICHEL: My dignity back."
"LORELAI: We'll have a rum and coke, a margarita no salt, martini with olives, a Shirley Temple"
"WAITRESS: Love her!"
"RORY: I'll have her on the rocks please."
"LORELAI: And uh, I will have a giant Long Island iced tea."
"WAITRESS: Coming up. [leaves]"
"EMILY: So Lorelai, how are you feeling?"
"LORELAI: Um, well, I'm tipsy, but just short of seeing pink elephants."
"EMILY: No, I mean about you getting married. It's only a week away."
"LORELAI: I'm fine. Everything's fine. I figured once I got the shoes to match the dress, the rest was just gravy."
"EMILY: I must say, I admire your composure. The week before my wedding, I was a wreck."
"MISS PATTY: So was I, before all of mine."
"SOOKIE: How many was that?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, uh, there was Sinjin, John, Sergio, Sinjin. Three men, four times."
"SOOKIE: Do you regret any of them?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, Sinjin was a let down the second time, but he was my Burton and I was his Taylor. Just wish I could've found a little Mike Todd there in the middle."
"EMILY: You know, I can't believe it was 34 years ago that I married Richard. I remember it so distinctly."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, this is gonna be a romantic story."
"EMILY: My stomach was not my friend. It was full of butterflies, I couldn't eat a bite the whole week."
"LORELAI: Hmm, what a bummer."
"EMILY: I was actually weak in the knees. Trembling all the time, can you imagine?"
"RORY: Really?"
"EMILY: When I wasn't actually with Richard, I was thinking about him. Constantly. Imagining what he was doing, was he thinking about me? Making up little scenarios in my head about how we'd run into each other accidentally at the club. And he would be playing golf and I would walk by and he would be so distracted that he'd completely miss the ball. Silly."
"SOOKIE: It's sweet."
"EMILY: I was in love"
"MICHEL: It is wonderful to be in love"
"EMILY: But the thing I remember most was that for the entire week before my wedding, I'd wait 'til my mother went to sleep, and I'd sneak out of bed and I'd put on my wedding dress and my tiara and my gloves, and I would stare at myself in the mirror and think how very safe I felt. How very right and wise and honored. This is a very good drink. I highly recommend it."
"SOOKIE: Okay, I have got to make a call."
"MISS PATTY: Are you calling Jackson?"
"SOOKIE: No. Well yes, but it's only because I need to pick up something I left at his house, that if it's still there, I should. . .hi honey, it's me. [leaves table]"
"EMILY: And who are you writing to?"
"RORY: I just want to see if Dean's around."
"EMILY: And thinking about you?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh no, not you too."
"LORELAI: No, it's just..it'sI'll be quick. [walks away from the table, dials her cell phone] Hi."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hi. Who's this?"
"LORELAI: It's Trixie from the other night. You never called me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Uh, you got me. Whatcha doing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm just hanging out. What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm at a bachelorette party."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh cool. Who's?"
"LORELAI: Mine."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yours? Wow."
"LORELAI: I know. I'm still kinda 'wow' about it myself."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well who's the lucky guy?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you don't know him. His name's Max."
"CHRISTOPHER: Right. Max."
"LORELAI: You do know him?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, Rory mentioned him. She didn't mention it was serious."
"LORELAI: Well, it wasn't. We hooked up, and then it was going good, then we broke up 'cause one of us kinda freaked out"
"CHRISTOPHER: You freaked out."
"LORELAI: I freaked out. And then we got back together and it suddenly got very serious."
"CHRISTOPHER: So is he worthy?"
"LORELAI: Is anyone?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Bono, maybe? Brian Ferry?"
"LORELAI: Get serious."
"CHRISTOPHER: A young Tom Waits?"
"LORELAI: Now you're talking."
"CHRISTOPHER: So what's he like?"
"LORELAI: He's great."
"CHRISTOPHER: Could you be a little more vague?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. He's Max. He's great."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, what's his CD collection like?"
"LORELAI: Don't read into his CD collection."
"CHRISTOPHER: Jazz, classical, what's the story?"
"LORELAI: It's a kind of a general collection."
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh oh."
"LORELAI: Uh, Christopher."
"CHRISTOPHER: Are we talking a dozen soundtracks, a few b*at, a Bob Dylan, plus a generic fifty?"
"LORELAI: I said don't."
"CHRISTOPHER: Alanis Morissette?"
"LORELAI: Hey, a lot of people knee-jerked and bought that first one of hers. Cut him some slack."
"CHRISTOPHER: Dave Matthews?"
"LORELAI: A couple of his things are good."
"CHRISTOPHER: Buena Vista Social Club?"
"LORELAI: Stop it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Enya?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna hit you."
"CHRISTOPHER: We're on the phone."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna come over there and hit you."
"CHRISTOPHER: You're at your bachelorette party."
"LORELAI: Right. Right."
"CHRISTOPHER: So why are you calling me?"
"LORELAI: Um, because you know me really well."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes I do."
"LORELAI: And I just wanted to tell someone who knows me really well that I am getting married."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, as someone who knows you really well, I say congratulations. If you found the guy, I think that's great."
"LORELAI: And you can picture me married, right?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. To the right guy, I can picture you married."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"CHRISTOPHER: You should get back to your party."
"LORELAI: Right, right. He's a great guy, Max."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm sure he is. I was just kidding around."
"LORELAI: I know. Well, I'll talk to you later."
"CHRISTOPHER: Bye. Hey, can you put Trixie back on the phone?"
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Lorelai walks back to the table.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Michel leave?"
"SOOKIE: Nope. He said he had to shake his thing. So how's your guy?"
"LORELAI: Hmm?"
"SOOKIE: How's Max doing?"
"LORELAI: Fine. Fine, everything's just fine."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting down drinking coffee.]"
"LORELAI: I think I know what an aneurysm feels like before you have it."
"SOOKIE: Like a baseball the size of a cantaloupe in your head."
"LORELAI: [giggle] Good one."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Baseball the size of a cantaloupe."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: 'Cause a baseball can only be one size, so it's a Yogi Berra type thing."
"SOOKIE: Yogi Bear?"
"LORELAI: No. Forget it."
"[Michel walks into the kitchen]"
"MICHEL: I feel like crap on toast."
"LORELAI: Hey, where were you after you broke off from the group?"
"MICHEL: Oh, I sat at a table with Janet Jackson and Celine Dion. Very nice guys. Oh, by the way, your husband-to-be is out there looking annoyingly perky. Slap him or I will."
"[Lorelai walks into the lobby]"
"MAX: Hey!"
"LORELAI: Ahhh."
"MAX: So what'd I do?"
"LORELAI: You spoke in a normal volume"
"MAX: Sorry."
"LORELAI: You did nothing wrong, I'm just mad you're not more hungover."
"MAX: I tried, I did."
"LORELAI: Ah, liar."
"MAX: I drank copiously."
"LORELAI: People who drank copiously the night before do not use words like copiously."
"MAX: Ask my brother."
"LORELAI: How is Mr. McMeterHopper?"
"MAX: Ironically, he feels better than you."
"LORELAI: Uh, it's so wrong."
"MAX: He's fine. So I was gonna drop my printer off at the house but Rory wasn't there, and guess who doesn't possess his own set of keys yet."
"LORELAI: Ahh, guessing it's you."
"MAX: Still me."
"LORELAI: Max, I'm sorry, I forgot."
"MAX: Again."
"LORELAI: Again. You're mad."
"MAX: No. A little."
"LORELAI: They're just keys."
"MAX: Try being without them and say that."
"LORELAI: I've lost my keys before."
"MAX: Well, I haven't lost them. I never got 'em."
"LORELAI: You'll get them."
"MAX: I'm trying really hard not to read too much into this."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"MAX: Like you don't want me having keys or you don't want me coming in the house."
"LORELAI: Max, that's crazy."
"MAX: Well, I need keys."
"LORELAI: Well, I need an assistant."
"MAX: No, you need to think about someone other than yourself for a few minutes a day."
"LORELAI: Ouch."
"MAX: That was too strong. Maybe I am a little hungover."
"LORELAI: It's not a good day for keys or communication."
"MAX: You know what, I'll just bring the printer by later."
"LORELAI: Yeah, bring it tomorrow."
"MAX: I'll bring it tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll have the keys."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai is sitting at the table paying bills. Rory is at the counter.]"
"RORY: I can't believe school's already starting."
"LORELAI: Ugh. I used to hate school starting. I once flipped the pages back in a calendar my mom kept in the kitchen and tried to convince her it was June and not September."
"RORY: Didn't work?"
"LORELAI: Hmm, oddly enough."
"RORY: I got an interesting call today. [sits at the table]"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, who?"
"RORY: Dad."
"LORELAI: Cool. How is he? I..I..I talked to him last night."
"RORY: He mentioned that."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I was about to mention it myself."
"RORY: That's quite a coincidence."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Did I not mention it last night?"
"RORY: Huh, no, not to my knowledge."
"LORELAI: I could've sworn I did."
"RORY: Why'd you call him?"
"LORELAI: Oh, just to check in."
"RORY: At your bachelorette party?"
"LORELAI: Seemed as good a time as any."
"RORY: To catch up on calls?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, pretty much."
"RORY: Seems like a weird time."
"LORELAI: Did he call just to fink on me?"
"RORY: No. He wanted to see what's up with you. He thought it was weird too."
"LORELAI: Heaven forbid I ever use the phone again."
"RORY: Was it when you told us you were calling Max?"
"LORELAI: Somewhere around there."
"RORY: Why would you tell us you were calling Max?"
"LORELAI: Honey, someday when you're a little older you will be introduced to something that is extremely seductive but fickle. A fair-weather friend who seems benign but packs a wallop like a donkey kick, and that is the Long Island iced tea. The Long Island iced tea makes you do things that you normally wouldn't do, like lifting your skirt in public or calling someone you normally wouldn't call at really weird times."
"RORY: I'm not looking forward to meeting the Long Island iced tea."
"LORELAI: I'd definitely walk the other way."
"RORY: You know, Dad wants you to be happy."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: And I really want you to be happy."
"LORELAI: I know, sweetie."
"RORY: You are happy about all this, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: Don't I seem happy?"
"RORY: I guess."
"LORELAI: Okay then."
"RORY: All right. I'll be in my room if you need me."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai comes out the front door and sees Luke taking a large wooden archway off the back of his truck.]"
"LORELAI: What is that?"
"LUKE: Oh, it's a chuppah."
"LORELAI: A what?"
"LUKE: A chuppah. You stand under it, you and Max. It's for your wedding."
"LORELAI: Did you make that?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I had some time, sohere, give me a hand, huh?"
"LORELAI: Luke, it's beautiful."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, I saw a picture in a book. The picture looked better."
"LORELAI: It's got carvings. Birds and flowers."
"LUKE: Yeah, there's also a goat."
"LORELAI: A goat!"
"LUKE: Yeah, I don't know what it stands for, but it was in the picture, and you like goats, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, goats are good."
"LUKE: Okay, so there you go."
"LORELAI: What on earth inspired you to do this?"
"LUKE: You're getting married. You can't just stand in the hot sun in the middle of a lawn that hasn't been mowed in weeks. I guess he doesn't mow."
"LORELAI: No, Max isn't a mower."
"LUKE: Okay, you needed something. Here it is. I'll mow it if you want."
"LORELAI: We got a guy who does that. One of the Pete's from the nursery."
"LUKE: Big Pete?"
"LORELAI: Little Pete."
"LUKE: He's the better of the Pete's."
"LORELAI: We've always thought so. Hey, aren't chuppahs Jewish?"
"[They sit on the front porch steps]"
"LUKE: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Is it okay that Max and I aren't Jewish?"
"LUKE: It's okay by me."
"LORELAI: No, but I mean to stand under it. God won't smite us or anything?"
"LUKE: I highly doubt it. Plus God'd probably have to get a license from Taylor to do any smiting in Stars Hollow on a weekend, so I'd say your safe. You know, I wasn't putting down Max. He seems like a really good guy."
"LORELAI: He is, and you were putting him down."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, I didn't mean to."
"LORELAI: Did you mean all those things you said about marriage?"
"LUKE: What things?"
"LORELAI: You really want me to repeat them to you?"
"LUKE: No. I mean, I guess, for some people marriage, you know, isn't the worst thing in the world. I mean, it's probably better than being hobbled or something like that."
"LORELAI: And people can evolve together, don't you think?"
"LUKE: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Yoko and John Lennon did. They just got closer and closer as the years went by. At the end, they had the same face."
"LUKE: Yeah, it got a little spooky."
"LORELAI: But cool."
"LUKE: Yeah, they were lucky. I guess if you can find that one person, you know, who's willing to put up with all your crap, and doesn't want to change you or dress you or you know, make you eat French food, then marriage can be all right. But that's only if you find that person."
"LORELAI: Yeah, if you find that person."
"[They both get up and stand under the chuppah.]"
"LORELAI: No one has ever made me a chuppah before."
"LUKE: Well, you only get married once. Theoretically."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you only get married once."
"[sh*t from behind of them standing together under the chuppah.]"
"CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory is on her bed reading as Lorelai rushes in.]"
"LORELAI: Pack!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Pack."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LORELAI: We are hitting the road."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Pack everything. Traveling light is for girls."
"RORY: What's going on here? Why are we hitting the road?"
"LORELAI: We haven't taken a road trip in forever and the weather is perfect."
"RORY: We can't take a road trip. You're getting married this weekend."
"LORELAI: Do you have my blue swimsuit?"
"RORY: What about Max?"
"LORELAI: Sunscreen, we need sunscreen."
"RORY: Mom, stop."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Are you and Max getting married?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why?"
"[Lorelai starts crying]"
"LORELAI: Because I didn't want to try on my wedding dress every night."
"RORY: Where are we going?"
"LORELAI: We don't have to."
"RORY: Hot, cold, rocky, sandy, mountain, valley?"
"LORELAI: I didn't really have a particular spot."
"RORY: Packing for all contingencies. Got it. Light layers."
"LORELAI: Yeah, light layers."
"RORY: Do you need a book?"
"LORELAI: Um, that Colette biography."
"RORY: I lost your place in it."
"LORELAI: That's okay. I have to start over anyway."
"RORY: You got it."
"LORELAI: And hurry."
"RORY: Are we going tonight?"
"LORELAI: First thing in the morning."
"RORY: Seven-ish?"
"LORELAI: Five-ish."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: It'll be more like six-ish."
"RORY: Let's sh**t for five-ish."
"LORELAI: You are crazy, and I love it."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S JEEP"
"[Early the next morning, Lorelai and Rory are in Lorelai's jeep driving through Stars Hollow.]"
"RORY: Wow, totally deserted."
"LORELAI: We're the last ones left."
"RORY: So are we almost there?"
"LORELAI: We're almost there and nowhere near it. All that matters is we're going."
"RORY: We're practically gone already."
"LORELAI: Look out world."
"[They stop at the red light and stare at it, waiting for it to change.]"

"OPEN INSIDE LORELAI'S JEEP"
"LORELAI: Ah. No music. I can't believe we forgot to bring tunes."
"RORY: Do you realize that neither of us has the vaguest idea where we are?"
"LORELAI: What is a road tip without tunes?"
"RORY: The sun is directly behind us."
"LORELAI: Never been in this car for any extended period of time without playing AC/DC."
"RORY: I have no idea which way it's going."
"LORELAI: I need my ""Highway to Hell."""
"RORY: It's right out the windshield there."
"LORELAI: There's nothing on the radio but Top 40 and Christian Rock. Christian Rock, there's an oxymoron for you. I need my tunes."
"RORY: Stop complaining about the tunes!"
"LORELAI: Stop complaining about our whereabouts."
"RORY: Well, my complaint is legitimate, yours is infantile."
"LORELAI: Okay, you're right. [turns on radio] Ooh, ooh, yee-haw, yes. Country music, must be my lucky day."
"RORY: [turns off radio] We have to figure out where we're going."
"LORELAI: No we don't."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: The point of this is to be spontaneous. To drive and land someplace we've never been and never expected to be."
"RORY: Sounds risky."
"LORELAI: Sounds exciting."
"RORY: Serendipity has never been kind to us."
"LORELAI: Ah, yes, but I talked to serendipity on the phone last night. She feels bad about how she's treated us in the past. We had a nice chat. It's all gonna be different now."
"RORY: What did that sign say? It said ""Don't"" or ""Death"" on it."
"LORELAI: Relax."
"RORY: We're doomed!"
"LORELAI: Wrong. We're being guided by fate."
"RORY: I think we're lost."
"LORELAI: We can't be lost. We don't know where we're going."
"RORY: You're going to stop before we drive into the Atlantic Ocean."
"LORELAI: I'll try."
"RORY: At least we'll know where we are."
"LORELAI: Unless it's the Pacific. [turns on radio]"
"RADIO: ""Coming up, a three song super set from Hootie and the Blowfish."""
"LORELAI: Aghhh!"
"RORY: Whaaaat!"
"[Opening Credits]"
"CUT TO FOOD STAND"
"[Lorelai and Rory are at a roadside food stand.]"
"LORELAI: You know what, I love road food."
"RORY: I love it too."
"LORELAI: I mean, what can be better then what they serve at a Haden's Nut House?"
"RORY: Unless you don't like nuts."
"LORELAI: As if those people exist. You know, if I was in a rock band touring and stuff, I'd make the bus driver stop at every Haden's Nut House we pass."
"RORY: Wow, your Behind the Music is gonna be really wild."
"CUT TO INSIDE JEEP"
"RORY: Okay, so if we continue on the way we've been goingwho are you calling?"
"LORELAI: [dialing her cell phone] Uh, Sookie."
"RORY: Now?"
"LORELAI: Uh, well, I didn't get a chance to call her before we left so she doesn't know about the"
"RORY: Oh."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I guess. It's just, umHi Sookie, it's me."
"SOOKIE: [at the Inn] Hi Sweetie, you on your way in?"
"LORELAI: Um, no, not yet. Actually, I'm um, I'm gonna be out of town for a couple of days."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Rory and I decided to hit the road."
"SOOKIE: But how can you be hitting the road? You're supposed to be getting"
"LORELAI: The engagement is off, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: What? What happened?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's a long story. I don't really wanna go into all the whats and whys and gory details right now, but you should know we all still love Max, and to figure out exactly what happened, you'd have to dig up Freud himself and have him work on me full time."
"SOOKIE: Aww, honey, I'm so sorry."
"LORELAI: Thanks. So I hope you didn't get too far on that cake."
"SOOKIE: [looking at almost-completed 5-tier cake] No, no, no. That's one thing you can be thankful about. You caught me in plenty of time."
"LORELAI: Good. I know the kind of work you were gonna put into it, and I just would've k*ll myself if you'd gone to all that craziness for nothing."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, well, I've been so busy lately, I actually forgot about it."
"LORELAI: Listen, do me a favor. Mention canceling the wedding to Miss Patty, will you? That way, by the time we get back"
"SOOKIE: The whole town will know within the hour."
"LORELAI: Then hopefully they will all have chatted it out of their systems before we get home."
"SOOKIE: Consider it done. So where you going?"
"LORELAI: We have no idea."
"SOOKIE: Ah, my favorite kind of trip."
"LORELAI: Well, thanks. I'll talk to you soon. Just call the cell if you need anything."
"SOOKIE: Okie dokie. Buh bye."
"LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up]"
"SOOKIE: You were a good cake Clyde. I never should've named you."
"CUT TO INSIDE JEEP"
"LORELAI: That had better not be a map."
"RORY: I'm sorry, but I'm openly defying your no map policy."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Mom, it's gonna be dark in a couple of hours and I don't want to sleep in the car."
"LORELAI: Ugh, my sense of adventure did not translate to my offspring."
"RORY: Now, to the best of my map reading abilities, we're headed towards Portsmouth, New Hampshire."
"LORELAI: Portsmouth. Huh."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I actually have a friend in Portsmouth. Donald, uhh, something-or-other Stein."
"RORY: A close personal friend, huh?"
"LORELAI: Donald moved there a couple of years ago and opened a B&B."
"RORY: Ughhh."
"LORELAI: No, it's actually supposed to be pretty cool."
"RORY: A cool B&B?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: That's like saying an understated Nicholas Cage movie."
"LORELAI: Listen, I myself am not usually a fan of the B&B, but Donald's place is different."
"RORY: Captain Corelli's Mandolin."
"LORELAI: I'm serious."
"RORY: 'Bella bambina at 2 o'clock.'"
"LORELAI: Every room is decorated in a different weird style for a different century."
"RORY: That is kinda cool."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's go."
"RORY: Let's call."
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"RORY: Let's call."
"LORELAI: Sense of adventure."
"RORY: Let's go."
"CUT TO B&B"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into the B&B carrying their bags. A woman is sitting behind the front desk.]"
"LADONN: Hello there."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"LADONN: Would you like to ring the bell?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LADONN: Would you like to ring the bell, you or your daughter?"
"LORELAI: I don't understand."
"LADONN: I'm not usually sitting here when guests arrive, so people ring the bell and they love to ring the bell, and you didn't get to ring the bell."
"LORELAI: Uh. . . [rings bell]"
"LADONN: Well done."
"LORELAI: Uh, do you have a room available?"
"LADONN: Yes, we most certainly do, you lucky pretty things you."
"LORELAI: See they have a room."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: Um, does Donald happen to be here?"
"LADONN: Oh no no, I bought this place from Donald last year. It's my place now. I'm LaDonn."
"LORELAI: Hi. Oh, yes, I noticed it was a little different. Actually, very different."
"LADONN: Oh, did you see it before?"
"LORELAI: Pictures."
"LADONN: Well, it was wacky, just like Donald. It was fun, you know, but just a little too woo-woo. It was just too eclectic. I don't care for eclectic. I don't think B&B-ers do either."
"LORELAI: No, you wouldn't want anything out of the normal."
"LADONN: Okay, room number 3 is all yours. Welcome to the Cheshire Cat."
"LORELAI: Nice name. I'm gonna consult with my daughter for just one second. [walks away from the desk] We must leave this place immediately."
"RORY: And sleep where?"
"LORELAI: Uh, a hollow tree, a riverbank, I don't care."
"RORY: Mom, I'm tired and I'm starving."
"LORELAI: Okay, she's named the place after an Alice in Wonderland character. This is my worst nightmare."
"RORY: And dying of exposure in a Jeep is mine."
"LORELAI: Okay, okay."
"[They walk back to LaDonn at the desk.]"
"LORELAI: So, just point the way to room three."
"LADONN: I'll take you there myself. Let me just grab your bags."
"RORY: Oh, we can do that."
"LADONN: No no no no no, you are my guests. I won't hear of it. There you go."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LADONN: Do you wanna ring the bell? You haven't rung the bell."
"RORY: Maybe some other time."
"LADONN: Follow me. [walks to staircase] Watch out for Sammy."
"LORELAI: Wowsie wowza."
"RORY: That's either Sammy or the cat that ate Sammy."
"[They walk up the steps past the cat.]"
"CUT TO INSIDE ROOM 3"
"[LaDonn walks through the door carrying the bags, followed by Lorelai and Rory.]"
"LORELAI: Aghhh!"
"LADONN: What is it, dear?"
"LORELAI: Uhh, there's just a lot"
"RORY: A lot of flowers."
"LORELAI: Yeah, like a ton of flowers."
"RORY: A plethora of flowers."
"LORELAI: A load of flowers."
"LADONN: Thank you! I get so many compliments on this room."
"LORELAI: Yeah, are they moving?"
"LADONN: It looks like it, doesn't it? There's foil in the paper and it gives it that illusion. Isn't it terrific?"
"LORELAI: Unbelievable."
"LADONN: B&B-ers love a peaceful setting so that they can unwind from their hectic lives. What business are you in, dear?"
"LORELAI: Oh, me? Uh, publishing."
"LADONN: How interesting."
"LORELAI: Mm."
"LADONN: Now if you need anything, you just ring down or come down 'cause I love company. And, oh, I don't want to forget to give you our activity list. Never a dull moment around here."
"LORELAI: Thanks LaDonn."
"RORY: Yes, thank you."
"[LaDonn leaves]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I think we just found the first room in the history of the world that would've made Liberace say 'Whoa. Step back. No one's that gay.'"
"RORY: Oh, look. This is a book that past guests have written in."
"LORELAI: Mmm."
"RORY: 'This room made my soul soar.'"
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"RORY: Ech."
"LORELAI: All right, enough grossness. Let's go eat."
"RORY: Oh food. I'm starving."
"CUT TO STAIRCASE"
"[Lorelai and Rory start to walk down the steps, but stop when they see a bunch of people downstairs.]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Dentists. Boston dentists. Cocktail hour at the Cheshire Cat."
"RORY: So?"
"LORELAI: So our exit is blocked."
"RORY: Let's just rush pass them."
"LORELAI: Too risky."
"RORY: They're not assassins."
"LORELAI: Rory, if they catch us they'll clamp onto us like leeches, and you know what that means."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Chitchat. Stomach-churning, mind-numbing, soul-deadening chitchat."
"RORY: Mom, I'm starving. I'm going down there, you can stay here."
"LORELAI: You're that hungry, huh?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Hungry enough to answer a hundred probing but only slightly differentiated from each other questions about Chilton, life in a small town, and your hunky hunky boyfriend?"
"[Rory walks back up the steps. Lorelai follows.]"
"CUT TO ROOM 3"
"[Lorelai sits on the bed looking through her purse while Rory is in the bathroom.]"
"LORELAI: Ohh, ahhh, I struck gold! [pulling something out of her purse]"
"RORY: What is it?"
"LORELAI: Certs."
"RORY: Let me catch my breath."
"LORELAI: I cannot for the life of me remember the last time I bought Certs."
"RORY: Which would make those really old."
"LORELAI: Fuzzy."
"[Lorelai puts it back in her purse. They both sit at the head of the bed. They hear music coming from downstairs.]"
"RORY: Perfect."
"LORELAI: A nice capper to the day."
"RORY: In the course of three hours, they've participated in every inane B&B group activity known to man."
"LORELAI: Let's just hope they finish with a mass su1c1de."
"RORY: We get cranky when we're hungry."
"LORELAI: Well, plus we're above everyone else on the planet."
"RORY: Clearly."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"RORY: So what do you want to do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. We could go to sleep."
"RORY: Mm, it's 8:23."
"LORELAI: Good Lord."
"RORY: I'm not really sleepy."
"LORELAI: Me neither. We could sing."
"RORY: Sing?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, we could sing ""Anarchy in the UK"" at the top of our lungs."
"RORY: Oh, that would be good. Or, uh, we could talk."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: What about?"
"RORY: Oh, I don't know. Umm, Max?"
"LORELAI: Uhh, no."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because I don't want to."
"RORY: You said we could talk."
"LORELAI: Yes, well I thought you meant about makeup or something."
"RORY: When have we ever talked about makeup?"
"LORELAI: Never, that's why I thought now would be a good time."
"RORY: I just need to know if"
"LORELAI: Goodnight Rory."
"RORY: But"
"LORELAI: Goodnight. [turns off light]"
"RORY: [turns on light] Are you sure that you're not just running scared?"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Because I think that you really love him but you're just freaked out"
"LORELAI: Enough! [turns out light]"
"RORY: and you don't know what to do! [turns on light] Because you did this before. With Max, in fact."
"LORELAI: Rory, I don't want to talk about this. I thought that by saying 'enough' and turning off the light, you would get the message. Apparently not. The skywriter will be here in a minute."
"RORY: I'm asking you a question."
"LORELAI: I am a grown woman."
"RORY: Says the woman with the ""Hello, Kitty"" waffle iron."
"LORELAI: I have earned the right not to be quizzed about my social life by my sixteen-year-old daughter."
"RORY: I thought I was your best friend!"
"LORELAI: When we're at a U2 concert, you are my best friend. But right now you are my sixteen-year-old daughter and I am telling you I do not want to have this conversation."
"RORY: Well I do."
"LORELAI: Well tough."
"RORY: Everything was planned! Everyone was excited, including you, and then all of a sudden, you're out!"
"LORELAI: Well, I changed my mind."
"RORY: This is our life that you just tossed off!"
"LORELAI: Hey, I didn't just toss off anything!"
"RORY: We had plans! We made space in the closet!"
"LORELAI: Oh Rory, just because we moved a couple of boxes is not reason enough for me to get married!"
"RORY: Max was counting on this! I was counting on this!"
"LORELAI: Rory, stop it! We are not gonna have this fight in a flowery bedroom with dentists singing ""Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves"" in the background. It's too David Lynch!"
"RORY: I think you love him!"
"LORELAI: Rory, go to sleep!"
"RORY: I think you love him, and you got scared and you ran, but you're really going to regret it. And soon!"
"LORELAI: Rory!"
"RORY: Fine! [turns out light] Goodnight!"
"[They both lay in the bed staring at the ceiling.]"
"LORELAI: I'm sure. I wish I did love him. You have no idea how much."
"[Rory gives Lorelai a kiss on the cheek.]"
"CUT TO ROOM 3"
"[The next morning, Lorelai sits on a trunk at the edge of the bed as Rory walks out of the bathroom.]"
"RORY: What's with the face?"
"LORELAI: Hmm, they're taller."
"RORY: Not this again."
"LORELAI: There's more of them."
"RORY: Mom, the flowers on the wallpaper are not growing or reproducing."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"RORY: Wait a minute. You weren't writing in this thing, were you?"
"LORELAI: Maybe some random thoughts."
"RORY: [reading guestbook] 'Satanic forces are at work here.' Mom."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: What? What? We cannot write that in here. [changes it] Here. 'Sat and forever am at work here.'"
"LORELAI: That doesn't make any sense."
"RORY: And it doesn't invoke the Dark Prince so I think it's preferable."
"LORELAI: Whatever."
"RORY: Hey?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Last night?"
"LORELAI: Oh, we're good."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: You know what isn't good?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I ate the fuzzy Certs."
"RORY: Gross!"
"LORELAI: They tasted like keys."
"RORY: Okay, enough. I have got to eat. Do you think the coast is clear downstairs?"
"LORELAI: Let's check the schedule. Early morning nature walk, 7:30. Regional history talk, 8:15, bluppity blah bah bah bah. We're in luck. Breakfast just ended and the arts and crafts workshop doesn't begin for another thirteen minutes."
"RORY: We've got a window!"
"LORELAI: It must be when they all shower."
"RORY: Grab your bag!"
"LORELAI: Go go go!"
"CUT TO DOWNSTAIRS"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the steps thinking there's nobody around, but are suddenly stopped by LaDonn and some guests who are standing at a window.]"
"LADONN: Hello strangers!"
"RORY: Uh!"
"LORELAI: Uhh, geez."
"LADONN: We've all been so worried about you two."
"LORELAI: What are you people doing?"
"LADONN: We're watching hummingbirds."
"WOMAN: They're still out there if you wanna scooch in."
"MAN: They're the darndest things. Flap their wings a hundred times a second. It's an engineering marvel."
"LORELAI: That was not on the freaking list."
"LADONN: We don't put things like this on the freaking list, because the delights of nature aren't on any kind of time schedule."
"LORELAI: No, Lordy."
"WOMAN: So push in some chairs. We're gonna make some fresh scones."
"LADONN: Yeah, they're for tea this afternoon. I just brought out the first test batch. Have a taste."
"RORY: A taste would not be bad."
"LORELAI: Uh, maybe just a quick taste."
"[Lorelai and Rory both sit down and take a scone. The man and woman join them at the table.]"
"WOMAN: So, LaDonn says you're in publishing."
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"WOMAN: Publishing, you're in publishing?"
"LORELAI: Oh yes, I am."
"MAN: Books, huh? You should find a field with less paperwork."
"LORELAI: Good one. [reaches for another scone]"
"RORY: Mmm! Hey!"
"LORELAI: You have two, I still have one!"
"WOMAN: So, uh, publishing?"
"LORELAI: Mm hmm. Yes, I do publish. Um, it's kind of a dry line of work, not much to talk about."
"LADONN: Oh, nonsense. It's fascinating."
"WOMAN: So what kind of books do you publish?"
"LORELAI: Umm, mainly youth-oriented ones."
"WOMAN: Children's books?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"WOMAN: Oh, any that we've heard of?"
"LORELAI: Probably not."
"WOMAN: No, wait, please. Give me some titles. I'll write them down and then when I get home, I'll look them up. Dave, do you have your space pen?"
"MAN: Do you have to ask?"
"WOMAN: Oh, he loves his space pen."
"MAN: They write under water."
"RORY: Cool."
"WOMAN: So, what are the titles?"
"LORELAI: Well, there's um, 'Goodnight, Spoon' and um, 'The Horse that Wanted to Bark'."
"WOMAN: Oh, I think I've read that to my grandson. The horse learns to bark, and then he. . . oh, what happens at the end?"
"LORELAI: He dies."
"RORY: But he learned to bark though, so it's actually an upper."
"WOMAN: So, where are your offices?"
"LORELAI: They're in the ummin the building with the uhh, over on the roadwould you guys excuse me for just a second? I have to make a very important call concerning publishing."
"LADONN: Oh, well that's just fine. It'll give us a chance to get to know your lovely daughter here."
"WOMAN: She's so quiet. But we'll change all that."
"RORY: Mom, you promised not to do any business while on vacation."
"LORELAI: Honey, publishing waits for no man. Gotta keep the presses pressing. [walks away]"
"WOMAN: So, tell us about your school."
"CUT TO STAIRCASE"
"[Lorelai sits on the steps next to the cat and talks on her phone.]"
"LORELAI: Hey Sookie, it's me."
"SOOKIE: [sitting at Luke's counter] Hey sweetie, how's the trip going?"
"LORELAI: It's fine. Where are you?"
"SOOKIE: Luke's. Got a nice little show going on here."
"[Kirk is sitting at a table with a cup of coffee. Luke is giving him his check. Sookie holds up the phone so Lorelai can hear them argue.]"
"LUKE: You're been sitting there for two hours."
"KIRK: I just want a little more coffee."
"LUKE: You've had eight refills."
"KIRK: You know, in France, when you sit and order, you can have the table as long as you want."
"LUKE: I bet you know what I'm gonna say next."
"KIRK: That we're not in France?"
"LUKE: Give or take a profanity."
"KIRK: Fine, I'll go. Can I have my check?"
"LORELAI: So, um, how's the spreading of the news going?"
"SOOKIE: Well, it worked just like you wanted, with one notable exception."
"LORELAI: Ooh, what?"
"SOOKIE: He's just such a loner lately, the news hasn't gotten to him."
"LUKE: Is there anyway to speed this up Kirk?"
"KIRK: Sorry. I'm trying to figure out the tip and I've always been terrible with math. What's six percent of four forty three?"
"LORELAI: Could you just tell him now Sook, so I can cross this off my list?"
"SOOKIE: Well, Iugh, he's coming over, hang on. Hey Luke?"
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"SOOKIE: Have you heard the latest news, kinda sad, Lorelai and Max?"
"LUKE: What about them?"
"SOOKIE: The wedding's off."
"LUKE: What? What happened?"
"SOOKIE: You know, I don't really know. It was all kinda sudden. This is actually her now."
"LUKE: Oh, well, uh, tell her I'm sorry. That's tough."
"SOOKIE: He says he's sorry."
"LORELAI: Thanks. Talk to you later. Bye."
"SOOKIE: Buh bye. [hangs up]"
"[Luke walks over to Kirk's table and serves him more coffee.]"
"KIRK: What's this?"
"LUKE: Refill number nine"
"KIRK: I thought you said I had to go."
"LUKE: You can hang a bit."
"KIRK: Really?"
"LUKE: Welcome to France. Coffee's on the house too."
"KIRK: Thanks. Or should I say gracias."
"LUKE: In fact, everyone's coffee's on the house today. I like your hat."
"MAN: Oh, thank you."
"CUT TO B&B"
"[Rory is still sitting at the table with LaDonn and the older couple.]"
"WOMAN: We have a son just a bit older than you."
"MAN: He's not good enough for her."
"WOMAN: Oh, Dave. He's a freshman at Brown."
"MAN: He majors in MTV."
"WOMAN: Oh you're horrible!"
"MAN: Honey, we don't even know if she's on the market."
"RORY: Oh, I'm not on the market. I'm definitely off the market."
"LADONN: She has a boyfriend."
"WOMAN: How cute!"
"LADONN: Tell us all about him."
"[Lorelai returns to the table]"
"RORY: Mom! I saved you a scone, you love me right?"
"LORELAI: Uh, sorry everybody. I'm gonna have to drag her away now."
"RORY: Aww shucks. It was so nice talking to you. [leaves]"
"WOMAN: Lovely talking to you dear. Oh, so cute."
"CUT TO ANOTHER DOWNSTAIRS ROOM"
"RORY: I now have abandonment issues."
"LORELAI: I had to make a call."
"RORY: You left me hanging."
"LORELAI: I owe you one."
"RORY: Big time."
"LORELAI: All right. Well, you're out now, what do you wanna do?"
"RORY: k*ll you."
"LORELAI: And?"
"RORY: I don't know. What do you wanna do?"
"LORELAI: Bounce tennis balls off of Sammy?"
"RORY: Seriously?"
"LORELAI: I'm not sure. Why don't you pull out the map you're hiding?"
"RORY: I'm not hiding a map."
"[Lorelai stares at her]"
"RORY: Well, I didn't want to drive around aimlessly again today. [pulls out map]"
"LORELAI: I got it, I got it. So what's near?"
"RORY: Um, Concord."
"LORELAI: What is that, like look at grapes?"
"RORY: Manchester."
"LORELAI: Uh, been there, done that."
"RORY: You've never been there."
"LORELAI: Well I feel like I have."
"RORY: Salem."
"LORELAI: Ooh, witches and stonings! There's something there."
"RORY: Boston, Newton, Needham"
"LORELAI: Oh, go go go go back."
"RORY: What? Boston, Newton?"
"LORELAI: I know where we're going."
"RORY: Where are we going?"
"LORELAI: You will love it."
"RORY: [starts folding map] Well, if you tell me where we're going I can chart a course and I can"
"[Lorelai walks over and crumbles up the map]"
"RORY: You're folding it wrong!"
"LORELAI: Is it smaller?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Then it's not wrong. Let's go. I will get you a new one when we get there."
"RORY: Where are we going?"
"CUT TO HARVARD UNIVERSITY"
"[Lorelai and Rory stand in front of the entrance gate for Harvard.]"
"RORY: I don't believe it."
"LORELAI: Believe it, 'cause there it is."
"RORY: Harvard University."
"LORELAI: It's really real."
"RORY: It looks just like the pictures."
"LORELAI: Beautiful."
"RORY: What are we doing here?"
"LORELAI: We are beholding your future."
"RORY: It's big."
"LORELAI: You have a big future."
"RORY: I can't believe it. I'm actually standing outside of Harvard."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: Wait. Come on where?"
"LORELAI: Inside."
"RORY: We can't go inside."
"LORELAI: Why, is there a force field or something around the place?"
"RORY: This is Harvard."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: This is Harvard."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: You can't just go inside. You need a guide."
"LORELAI: I'll be your guide."
"RORY: What do you know about Harvard?"
"LORELAI: I know this. Look, there's Harvard."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Hey, don't you want to see it? Huh? The place where you'll be living and studying and developing very naïve but pretentious world views that will come crashing down the minute you graduate?"
"RORY: Yeah, I do."
"LORELAI: So? Come on, you know you want to. All the other kids are doing it."
"RORY: Harvard."
"[They walk through the gate.]"
"CUT TO HARVARD COURTYARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking as Lorelai reads through a guidebook.]"
"LORELAI: Wow! Harvard is over 300 years old."
"RORY: Founded in 1636."
"LORELAI: That means that almost everyone who ever went to Harvard is dead now. Are you sure you still want to go here?"
"RORY: Yes, I'm sure."
"LORELAI: They developed the pacemaker here. Also, discovered how electromagnetism and radioactivity are two manifestations of the same force and postulated existence of a charmed quark. I was wondering who did that."
"RORY: The smarties at Harvard."
"LORELAI: Holy smokes. They get an average of 18,000 applicants every year and only 2,000 get in. Those are not good odds."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No no no, you're different. Past graduates. Henry Jamesisn't that a beer?"
"RORY: And a novelist. Go on."
"LORELAI: John Adams. That's a beer!"
"RORY: Our second president. He's very in right now."
"LORELAI: W.E.B. Du Bois, Yo-Yo Ma. Oh cool! Fred Gwynn."
"RORY: Who?"
"LORELAI: Herman Munster. Now I'm impressed."
"RORY: Do you want something?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, a nice cold Henry James."
"RORY: Or some coffee?"
"LORELAI: Or some coffee."
"RORY: I'm ordering coffee at Harvard."
"[Rory goes to order from a vendor. Lorelai starts reading a bulletin board.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, there's people looking for roommates. Tons of them. 'Wanted, girl to share a two bedroom apartment located on trial bridge, quiet street, quiet building, so quiet roomie a must.' Join a convent and cloister yourself you loser."
"RORY: [walks back] Mom, it's gonna be two years before I go to Harvard. These people will have roommates or have graduated by them."
"LORELAI: Who says these are for you?"
"RORY: Who are they for?"
"LORELAI: Me. If you're gonna live in a dorm, I need a room nearby so I can come visit."
"RORY: How often are you gonna visit?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, every other day. Too much? What's too much?"
"[Rory walks back to the vendor. A male student walks up to the bulletin board.]"
"STUDENT: Man, there are a lot of postings here."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, there sure are."
"STUDENT: You looking for a place to live?"
"LORELAI: Uhh, maybe."
"STUDENT: Well there's a lot of choices. Something for everybody."
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. Unless you're one of those existentialists who can't really figure out what they want."
"STUDENT: Good point, good point. Hey, I think we have a class together. Contract Law, Professor Chefferson?"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, Chef's class."
"STUDENT: Right. I've been meaning to say hi to you."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"STUDENT: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Oh, hi."
"STUDENT: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"STUDENT: So do you like the class?"
"LORELAI: Um, it's not too bad."
"STUDENT: He's kinda got a monotone voice. If I don't caf up he puts me right to sleep."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm about to caf up right now just for the hell of it."
"STUDENT: Okay. So I'll see you in class. And maybe at that Phi Cap party tonight?"
"LORELAI: Ginchy!"
"STUDENT: Cool. Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Student leaves. Rory walks back with coffee.]"
"LORELAI: I think I'm gonna like college! Ooh, did you hear? I used existentialist in a sentence!"
"RORY: I heard!"
"LORELAI: I've always wanted to do that."
"RORY: It was very impressive."
"LORELAI: Ah!"
""
""
""
"CUT TO COURTYARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory walking along. Rory suddenly stops to stare at a building.]"
"RORY: Oh my."
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"RORY: It's the library."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: The biggest library I've ever seen."
"LORELAI: Uh oh. Brace yourself."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: This is just one of the libraries."
"RORY: One of the libraries?"
"LORELAI: This building is one component of a thirteen million volume collection housed in more than ninety different libraries. It's the oldest library in the United States and the largest academic library in the world. Breathe, breathe."
"RORY: I'm a failure."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I am stupid."
"LORELAI: Oh stop."
"RORY: I am uniformed and ignorant and. . .I can't even think of a second synonym for uninformed. I suck."
"LORELAI: Honey."
"RORY: Thirteen million volumes? I've read like, what, three hundred books in my entire life and I'm already sixteen? Do you know how long it would take me to read thirteen million books?"
"LORELAI: But honey, you don't have to read every one of them. ""Tuesday's with Morrie?"" Skip that. ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" Just stuff you already know."
"RORY: Okay, but every kid coming to Harvard is inevitably reading books, and different books, and I want to be able to converse intelligently with each of them and I can't do that unless I read books, at least a few from every genre and sub-genre."
"LORELAI: Okay, come on. I'm getting you out of here."
"RORY: I sleep too much."
"LORELAI: No you don't."
"RORY: I've been frittering away my whole life."
"LORELAI: You don't fritter."
"RORY: Did I mention I suck?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: Well I do."
"LORELAI: No."
"CUT TO RESIDENCE HALL"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking past a dormitory.]"
"LORELAI: This is a dorm? Not bad, huh?"
"RORY: Pretty, actually."
"LORELAI: Come on, let's see what it looks like on the inside."
"RORY: It says ""Residents Only"" in plain English."
"CUT TO INSIDE DORM"
"RORY: We're gonna get in trouble."
"LORELAI: You're such a worrywart. Ooh, get in character."
"RORY: What?"
"[Two female students are walking down the hall.]"
"LORELAI: Hey there!"
"GIRL 1: Hi."
"LORELAI: I'm Angie, this is Trish."
"GIRL 2: Hi."
"LORELAI: How's it going?"
"GIRL 1: Not bad."
"LORELAI: Oh, cool. We're just kinda hanging out between classes. We got Chef next. So, we'll probably see you at the Phi Alpha Beta thing tomorrow, right?"
"GIRL 1: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, we're not sure either. They can be so totally lame. Gag me."
"GIRL 1: Yeah. See ya. [Students leave]"
"RORY: You do realize that all of your college kid jargon comes from 'Happy Days' and the 'Valley Girls' song?"
"[They stop in front of a room with the door open.]"
"LORELAI: Unh! Lookie lookie here."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Ooh, I wanna see a room. Hello!"
"RORY: They have pictures of their rooms on their website."
"LORELAI: So I prefer reality, thank you. Hello! Coast is clear. [walks into the room]"
"RORY: The coast is not clear."
"LORELAI: Susie!"
"RORY: We're now officially breaking and entering."
"LORELAI: Susie!"
"RORY: Why are you saying that?"
"LORELAI: 'Cause it's our cover in case we get caught. Plus there's a thirty percent chance that the girl living in this room is named Susie. Wow, tiny."
"RORY: It is tiny."
"LORELAI: Your Oxford English Dictionary's gonna need a room of it's own."
"RORY: It'll fit somewhere."
"LORELAI: One window, brick wall. You're gonna need a better view."
"RORY: Well, this isn't my room to begin with."
"LORELAI: At least there's two beds. Somewhere for me to sleep."
"RORY: That would be my roommate's bed."
"LORELAI: Oh, you don't want a roommate."
"RORY: I don't think I have a choice."
"LORELAI: They just force someone on you?"
"RORY: It's all part of the socializing experience."
"LORELAI: What if it's a lemon?"
"RORY: Then I'm stuck with a lemon."
"LORELAI: Hari Krishna banging a tambourine all night?"
"RORY: Then I have to get earplugs."
"LORELAI: Serial m*rder?"
"RORY: Then I sleep with a gat strapped to my ankle."
"LORELAI: Someone who likes Linkin Park?"
"RORY: Then I have to drop out."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm. Ah, look! I had these same pants back in high school."
"RORY: Can we just go now please?"
"LORELAI: I'm in again."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Okay. Just come over here and let me take a picture with you sitting at the desk."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, really get into it. Pretend like you're studying."
"RORY: Uhh, okay."
"LORELAI: What is thatyou're writing in the air?"
"RORY: Can we just take the picture?"
"LORELAI: Okay, okay."
"[They exit room as a girl is starting to enter.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey Susie."
"[They hurry out down the hallway]"
"CUT TO INSIDE BUIDLING"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down a hallway of one of the academic buildings.]"
"RORY: God, these classrooms are huge."
"LORELAI: Better to fit those big Harvard brains."
"[They stand in the doorway of one of the lecture halls and listen.]"
"PROFESSOR: . . . had given birth. Reckon on everything, expect everything. What sort of thought is this?"
"STUDENT: Depressing?"
"PROFESSOR: On the surface, maybe. But go underneath. What is he postulating beyond fatalism?"
"LORELAI: Are we allowed to be hearing this?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: They wouldn't charge you a hundred bucks or something just for listening to part of a class?"
"RORY: I don't think Harvard would nickel and dime people like that."
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm gonna find a ladies room. You know, sneak a smoke, see if anybody slipped an aspirin in my coke."
"RORY: Okay, Rizzo. I'd like to listen a little bit more."
"LORELAI: I'll be back."
"RORY: I'll be here."
"PROFESSOR: The stoics believe the greatest happiness resulted from leading a virtuous life"
"[Rory drops her coffee cup, everyone turns around to see what the noise was.]"
"PROFESSOR: In or out?"
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"PROFESSOR: If you're going to take the class, you have to take a seat."
"RORY: Oh, uhh, okay. Sorry. [sits down]"
"PROFESSOR: Okay, where were we?"
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai walks out of the ladies room. She stops to stare at the wall of class valedictorians. A few seconds later, she hears Rory's voice from inside the classroom.]"
"RORY: That's an interesting point, Professor, but I'm not sure I agree with it."
"CUT TO CLASSROOM"
"RORY: That's because stoicism was not about giving up things, of money and luxuries and stuff."
"PROFESSOR: That's right. By the time he was in his early forties, Seneca had earned enough money to acquire villas, farms, he ate well, he loved expensive furniture, but he didn't consider that a non-philosophical way to live."
"[Lorelai watches from the doorway.]"
"RORY: It's all kind of relative though."
"STUDENT: Oh, here we go."
"RORY: What?"
"STUDENT: We can't get through a class without debating relativism."
"RORY: I just meant that luxury to some is not necessarily luxury to others."
"PROFESSOR: A better subject for another time."
"RORY: Oh sorry."
"PROFESSOR: No, no, your point is well taken, but it's different than the matter at hand. What we're talking about is Seneca's choosing the better more comfortable of two options while remaining a stoic."
"RORY: [to student] Thanks. This was fun. [walks out]"
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the classroom.]"
"RORY: Did you see me?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: I was in college."
"LORELAI: It was amazing!"
"RORY: Did I look like I belonged?"
"LORELAI: Completely. You're a natural"
"RORY: I can't even believe how it happened. I just sort of got swept up and then the teacher asked a question, and before I knew it"
"LORELAI: You were blowing them away."
"RORY: Well, I don't know if I was blowing them away but suddenly I was talking and I couldn't stop."
"LORELAI: I know that feeling."
"RORY: College is gonna be amazing. I can't wait. I love college. I love Harvard. I love fatalism."
"CUT TO B&B"
"[LaDonn carries their bags down the stairs while Lorelai and Rory follow.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, please LaDonn, we can carry the bags."
"LADONN: Nonsense."
"RORY: But they're so heavy."
"LADONN: I'll just get them down the stairs for you. Whew. Let me catch my breath here."
"LORELAI: Oh, wow! Sammy's AWOL, huh?"
"LADONN: Hmm?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Sammy. It's like the first time that she hasn't been there on the stairs."
"LADONN: What, my Sammy?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LADONN: Oh, she's rarely ever on the stairs."
"LORELAI: Oh no, she's always right there."
"LADONN: On the stairs?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LADONN: No, she has her favorite places, but not on the stairs."
"LORELAI: There has not been one moment over our entire stay when she has not been right there."
"LADONN: On the stairs?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LADONN: Oh, she's hardly ever on the stairs."
"RORY: Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown."
"[They walk to the front desk.]"
"LADONN: Everything's on your card. I hope you enjoyed your stay. Did you enjoy your stay?"
"RORY: Very much."
"LADONN: Aw, very much?"
"LORELAI: I sat and forever am at work here."
"LADONN: What?"
"RORY: It was great."
"LADONN: Well, there you go. Drive safely, and tell all your friends about the Cheshire Cat."
"LORELAI: Oh, you bet we will."
"LADONN: As soon as you leave, I'm gonna do my favorite part of the job."
"LORELAI: Oh, what's that?"
"LADONN: I'm gonna read what you wrote in our guestbook."
"LORELAI: Give us a five minute headstart?"
"LADONN: Beg pardon?"
"RORY: Thank you."
"[They pick up their bags and walk out the front door.]"
"CUT TO INSIDE JEEP"
"[Back in Stars Hollow, Lorelai and Rory are driving to their house.]"
"RORY: You know what I love most about Harvard?"
"LORELAI: No, what?"
"RORY: They don't sell giant foam fingers."
"LORELAI: No, they've got class out the wazoo. Home."
"RORY: Feel like we've been gone a long time."
"LORELAI: You know what's weird? Every time I leave town, even for just a little while, I always expect everything to look different."
"RORY: And it never does."
"LORELAI: It never does."
"[They drive by townies offering sympathetic looks, including Miss Patty dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, and Kirk with his arms wide open.]"
"KIRK: Need a hug?"
"LORELAI: Patty's good."
"[They pull in their driveway.]"
"LORELAI: So, what about dinner?"
"RORY: It should probably be something healthy since we've been eating junk the whole trip."
"LORELAI: We had lettuce on our burgers last night."
"RORY: You picked it off."
"LORELAI: But it left its essence."
"RORY: There was lettuce essence on our burgers?"
"LORELAI: Definitely."
"RORY: And that satisfied our vegetable requirement?"
"LORELAI: For the week."
"RORY: We can't argue with cold hard facts."
"[Lorelai notices the chuppah in the front yard and stares at it.]"
"RORY: What? Oh, I forgot about that."
"LORELAI: Me too. Well, everything's the same."
"[Lorelai walks over to the chuppah and starts to cry as she stares at it.]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai is showing slides of the road trip as Emily and Rory sit on the couch.]"
"LORELAI: This is Sever Hall, one of the oldest buildings in Harvard."
"EMILY: Focus the picture Lorelai."
"LORELAI: It is focused."
"RORY: That's how it came out."
"EMILY: It's hurting my eyes."
"LORELAI: Come on Mom, they're supposed to be a little arty."
"RORY: Plus she doesn't know how to use her camera."
"LORELAI: I've only had it six years."
"EMILY: It's like I have glaucoma. What's that?"
"LORELAI: That is a Harvard squirrel."
"EMILY: Good grief."
"RORY: Sitting on a Harvard rock."
"LORELAI: Doesn't he look smart?"
"EMILY: He looks dirty. Next."
"LORELAI: That's Rory's dorm, and part of my finger."
"RORY: It's not my dorm yet. We just saw a dorm and figured it might be mine."
"EMILY: Why in the world do you insist on taking slides?"
"LORELAI: I like slides."
"EMILY: But prints are so much easier, and faster to get through."
"LORELAI: That's what I hate about prints. You give people this big pile of pictures that you're so proud of and they end up just flipping through them super fast without really seeing them or giving you a chance to narrate them like you can with slides."
"RORY: I stopped her from adding music."
"EMILY: I'm eternally grateful."
"LORELAI: I like the bigness of slides too. Makes you feel like you're really there."
"EMILY: Yes, this one makes me feel just like I'm in your finger."
"LORELAI: Oh. You're just jealous that we didn't invite you to come along."
"RORY: Next time."
"EMILY: Next time you go to Harvard, you're going to do it properly, with a scheduled visit and a guide."
"RORY: I told her about the guide."
"EMILY: And why would you go out of town now so soon before your wedding? Didn't your fiancé mind?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well"
"EMILY: I mean, you act as if this coming weekend is just going to be business as usual and not the most important day of your life."
"RORY: Mom."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's about this weekend Mom."
"EMILY: Yes?"
"LORELAI: I should've told you before."
"EMILY: Oh my God, you didn't!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: You did!"
"LORELAI: I did what?"
"EMILY: You eloped!"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: I knew it! I knew you'd do anything to keep me out of this wedding."
"LORELAI: Mom, that's not"
"EMILY: Well that is just cruel, Lorelai. A mother waits and plans for this day, even your mother."
"LORELAI: Yes, but"
"EMILY: I bought a new dress, I got my hair done."
"LORELAI: It looks nice."
"EMILY: And tonight you just waltz in here, torture me for hours with these ridiculous slides, only to let me know at the last possible minute"
"LORELAI: Mom, Max and I are not together anymore. The wedding is off."
"EMILY: The wedding's off?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: Are you sure?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm sure."
"EMILY: Oh."
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"EMILY: Who called it off?"
"LORELAI: I did. You're thinking you're not surprised."
"EMILY: No I wasn't."
"LORELAI: You're thinking, 'Yes, I won that five bucks from Dad.'"
"EMILY: Who would like dessert?"
"LORELAI: What Mom? What are you thinking? Just tell me."
"EMILY: I was thinking I guess I have to return your gift."
"LORELAI: My gift?"
"EMILY: That's right."
"LORELAI: You'll have to return my gift. That'sthat's what you were thinking?"
"EMILY: That's right."
"LORELAI: That's it?"
"EMILY: That's it."
"LORELAI: Oh. So you got me a gift already?"
"EMILY: You were getting married. Gifts are expected. It's the proper thing to do. So how's ice cream sound?"
"RORY: Ice cream sounds great."
"LORELAI: So what'd you get me Mom?"
"[Emily walks out of the room. Lorelai follows her.]"
"EMILY: I'm not gonna tell you that."
"LORELAI: Why not? It's for me."
"EMILY: But you're not getting it now."
"LORELAI: Iced tea spoons, right?"
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Because nobody really needs iced tea spoons ever. I mean, you probably would use 'em if you remembered to use 'em but nobody remembers to use 'em because they're always in a different drawer than the everyday silverware. Out of sight, out of mind. So people just grab a regular old everyday spoon to stir with, and you know what, they work fine."
"EMILY: It wasn't iced tea spoons."
"LORELAI: Oh, uhhhoh, oh! Corn on the cob holder thingies! Sterling silver corn on the cob holder thingies?"
"EMILY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Hah!"
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: The tiny forks."
"EMILY: What tiny forks?"
"LORELAI: The tiny forks with the tiny prongs and the tiny handles that I can only assume are used to eat the tiny food."
"EMILY: They're for lobster tails."
"LORELAI: So you did get the tiny forks!"
"EMILY: You know what, I'm not returning the gift. I'm going to put it away in a closet and you won't know what it is until you do get married someday."
"LORELAI: Tell me now!"
"EMILY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Come on! Mom, I may never get married. I may be a free spirit my whole life or fall in love with a separated catholic guy like Katherine Hepburn did and then, and then not get to go to his funeral when he dies."
"EMILY: Well then you'll never get to know what I got you, will you?"
"LORELAI: I've gotta know!"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: This is torture!"
"EMILY: Tough."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine, forget it. I'm going to the bathroom."
"EMILY: I'm going to the kitchen."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"EMILY: Hm."
"[They both walk away. Cut to Rory, still sitting on the couch, listening to them.]"
"LORELAI: HAH!"
"EMILY: Oh God, you scared me!"
"LORELAI: Come on, tell me!"
"EMILY: Lorelai, get away."
"LORELAI: Tell me now."
"EMILY: I'm serious, get away from me."
"LORELAI: Please tell me."
"EMILY: This is not funny."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory get out of their Jeep across the street from Luke's.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, am I too far from the curb?"
"RORY: Oh, you're within five feet."
"LORELAI: Close enough for jazz."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"RORY: Pick it up?"
"LORELAI: You got it."
"LANE: Rory! [runs towards her]"
"RORY: Oh my God, Lane! [runs towards her]"
"LANE: I'm back!"
"RORY: I see!"
"LANE: Oh, did you ever think this day would come?"
"RORY: I had hopes, dreams."
"LANE: I escaped from Korea, I'm home. Hi Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Welcome home, sweetie."
"LANE: It's so amazing to be back. When I got off the plane, I kissed the tarmac."
"LORELAI: Just like the Pope."
"LANE: It was hot and I b*rned my lips."
"RORY: Maybe that's why the Pope always looks so grumpy."
"LANE: I'm back!"
"RORY: I know!"
"LANE: Did you get my letters?"
"RORY: Yeah, the first one was a little intense."
"LANE: Which one was that?"
"RORY: The one that said Korea equals death with a bunch of exclamation points and your very sad face cut up plastered all over it."
"LANE: Okay, so that was a tad dramatic."
"RORY: Was it awful?"
"LANE: You know what, it wasn't."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LANE: Some of it was great."
"RORY: No way."
"LANE: Yeah, some of the food's not so bad, and then my cousins were actually pretty interesting, and the best part, Korea is bootleg heaven. I totally scored in Seoul. Elvis Costello at the Marquee in 1978. A barely coherent Nico doing Dora songs in 1974, and even more barely coherent, Iggy Pop doing David Bowie songs naked in 1981."
"RORY: How did you get them past customs?"
"LANE: Well, I strapped them to my body like in Midnight Express."
"RORY: Cool."
"LORELAI: I'll be in Luke's. [walks towards Luke's Diner]"
"RORY: Okay. So it was just an open-ended plane ticket?"
"LANE: Just to save money. I guess I kind of overreacted."
"RORY: Kind of? You did everything but tie a string with you at one end and the Statue of Liberty at the other."
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks through the door.]"
"LUKE: Hey!"
"LORELAI: Lewis and Clark have returned."
"LUKE: Oh yeah, which one are you?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Which one had to paddle the canoe?"
"LUKE: Coffee?"
"LORELAI: You have to ask?"
"LUKE: So, uh, sorry about what happenedyou know, the wedding thing"
"LORELAI: It's okay. I'm fine. I want everyone to know that."
"LUKE: Uh, I've been feeling like a jerk."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: Well, the way I had to come down on Max. I don't know, I was being aI don't know, what's that word you use, pickleschnitz?"
"LORELAI: Schnickelfritz?"
"LUKE: Yeah, that's it."
"LORELAI: Luke, it's okay, you already apologized for all that."
"LUKE: Well, I've been feeling kind of guilty."
"LORELAI: Don't. You are great, Luke. Just making me that chuppah alone"
"LUKE: Oh, the chuppah! I left that stupid chuppah on your lawn!"
"LORELAI: Hey, it's okay."
"LUKE: What an idiot!"
"LORELAI: Really, it's okay."
"LUKE: Just this enormous reminder, just sitting on your lawn, mocking you."
"LORELAI: I didn't even see it mock, I promise."
"LUKE: I'll take it down in the morning. No, I'll take it down now. Hey, we're closing early. Chew it or lose it!"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke, it's okay, really. I, uh, I think I'm gonna keep it."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. It's beautiful, and you made it for me, and it doesn't have to be a wedding chuppah. It can just be a beautiful archway in our yard. I'll grow stuff on it."
"LUKE: Well, okay. Um, I'll help you move it around the yard, wherever you want it to be."
"LORELAI: Well, that'd be good."
"LUKE: So where'd you guys go?"
"LORELAI: Well, we drove around a little, we hit a B&B, and we took a tour of Harvard."
"LUKE: Harvard. . . interesting."
"LORELAI: It was amazing. Seeing Rory there, in a dorm room, in a classroom. She fit."
"LUKE: Yeah, I can see her fitting there."
"LORELAI: She was right at home."
"LUKE: So, how you taking that?"
"LORELAI: Taking what?"
"LUKE: Seeing her fit?"
"LORELAI: I loved itand I hated it."
"LUKE: That seems about right."
"LORELAI: Man, these past few days. . .just so many thoughts about my life then, my life now, what I missed. Thoughts about what I'll never have, and what I want to have."
"LUKE: Yeah, that's a lot of thoughts."
"LORELAI: You're not kidding. So can I ask you a question?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Have you ever set up a line of credit at a bank?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: But you don't pay for everything with cash on hand, do you?"
"LUKE: What's all this about?"
"LORELAI: I think it's time to make a move."
"LUKE: Meaning?"
"LORELAI: I'm diving in. Sookie and I are finally gonna open that inn."
"LUKE: Yeah, I know."
"LORELAI: No, I mean now. We've been talking about it and dreaming about it and it's time to finally get going on it."
"LUKE: Well, if the time is right."
"LORELAI: It is. Think I can hack being a business owner?"
"LUKE: I think you can hack anything."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Yeah. I mean, you know all the creative stuff to the job, and you can manage and uh, I've seen you try to add numbers, so I'd get an accountant first thing."
"LORELAI: Okay, yes."
"LUKE: So how far along are you?"
"LORELAI: This far."
"LUKE: Well, listen, um, you know, I'm no financial genius, but you know, we can sit down sometime, and you can pick my brain on the few things I do know about."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Sure, I've been around some."
"LORELAI: Can I ask you stupid questions?"
"LUKE: There's no such thing."
"LORELAI: How does ink come out of pens?"
"LUKE: All right, there is such a thing. But, um, you're going to avoid that when we sit down, right?"
"LORELAI: Right. Thank you."
"LUKE: Yeah. And let me know when you need help with the thing that's not a chuppah anymore."
"LORELAI: I will. [leaves]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Lane are still outside talking]"
"LANE: So fill me in. What have you been up to? I've gotta know everything."
"RORY: I've been to Harvard."
"LANE: No way. Oh my God! How? When?"
"[Lorelai walks over]"
"RORY: Well, we just got back. Mom, is it okay if I go to Lane's for a bit?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I'll meet you back at the house."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Lorelai watches as they walk away.]"
"LANE: Harvard, that is so cool! I mean, what did you see?"
"RORY: Oh, Harvard Yard, classrooms, where I might live next year."
"LANE: How was it?"
"RORY: It needs a spruce."
"[Lorelai takes out her cell phone and dials, then walks towards the Jeep.]"
"LORELAI: Sookie, hey it's me, we're back. Good, it was good, but first things first. I wanna start moving on the inn thing. . .I mean, take serious steps. We're ready, don't you think? We're ready. . . Oh good! Well, meet me early at work tomorrow. Yeah. . . .I know, I'm excited too. [drives away]"

"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table. Lorelai's eating breakfast while Rory watches her.]"
"RORY: How are the eggs?"
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: I'm glad."
"LORELAI: They're still good."
"RORY: I'm still glad."
"LORELAI: Look freak, we will not be late."
"RORY: It's the first day of school. I wanna get there early."
"LORELAI: We will be there early, I promise."
"RORY: I have different classes this year, my routes aren't the same. I haven't found the quickest path around. And my locker, they moved it, so I don't even know if it'll work properly and then I'll have to get a new one and God knows how long that'll take or where it'll be and that could send the whole day into chaos. I'm just excited."
"[Lane walks into the diner]"
"LANE: Oh, thank God, you haven't left yet."
"RORY: Nope, what's up?"
"LANE: Well, I found the greatest record store in the world. It's ten minutes from your school and I'm wondering how much you love me."
"RORY: Address."
"LANE: Record Breaker Incorporated, 2453 Berlin Turnpike."
"RORY: Got it. Place your order now."
"LANE: Okay, Charles Mingus, ""The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady."""
"LORELAI: Mm."
"RORY: Right."
"LANE: The Sonics, Here are the Sonics."
"RORY: Burn me a copy. Next."
"LANE: MC5, Kick Out the Jams. Fairport Convention, Leige and Lief. BeeGees, Odessa."
"RORY: BeeGees, really?"
"LANE: Well, Mojo says."
"RORY: So it must be true."
"LANE: Okay, that's it. Now if I could just find a copy of Whistler, Chaucer, Detroit and Greenhill, I will finally be done with the sixties."
"RORY: I can get there today, tomorrow at the latest."
"LANE: I love it when you go back to school."
"RORY: Me too. Hey!"
"LORELAI: I am getting donuts for later. As soon as I do, I will take you to school and the nice men in the white coats will pick you up."
"[Lorelai walks up to the counter. Taylor is standing there with a group of Boy Scouts.]"
"TAYLOR: Everybody, listen up. Decide what you want, place your order, and then proceed to the end of the line."
"BOY 1: I want a burger."
"BOY 2: I want grilled cheese."
"BOY 3: Me too."
"BOY 2: And I want fries, and make them really really cripsy."
"BOY 1: I want mine crispy too."
"BOY 2: You didn't order fries."
"BOY 1: So?"
"LUKE: So you can't order crispy fries without first ordering fries."
"BOY 1: Why not?"
"LUKE: Because you can't make something crispy that doesn't exist."
"BOY 1: Why not?"
"LUKE: Get him away from me Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Have some respect. These boys have just completed the first leg of their outdoor survival training."
"LUKE: Meaning you had them sit under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours."
"TAYLOR: You're a very jaded man Luke. What happened to you as a child?"
"LUKE: Some creepy guy in shorts and knee socks tried to sit me under a tree and glue rocks together for two hours. Put that down!"
"BOY 4: Why?"
"LUKE: Because otherwise you're going under it."
"BOY 4: I won't fit."
"LUKE: Oh yes you will."
"LORELAI: Hey, donuts please."
"BOY 1: We were here first!"
"LORELAI: On the planet?"
"BOY 1: Huh?"
"LORELAI: You lose. Chocolate, cinnamon and sprinkles."
"[phone rings; Lorelai and the kids moan as Luke goes to answer it.]"
"LUKE: All of you pipe down."
"LORELAI: Grups, huh?"
"LUKE: [on phone] Yeah, I'm working. What do you think I'm doing? Uh huh. Uh huh. Oh man, what did you do? Excuse me, are you serious? Just like that, huh?"
"[Lorelai goes behind the counter and gets her own donuts]"
"BOY 2: Hey Mr. Doose. She's not supposed to do that."
"TAYLOR: That's right. She's breaking the rules, and people who break the rules end up very lonely with no friends because they have become society's outcasts."
"LORELAI: Planning on burning a little Huck Finn after lunch, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Excuse me?"
"LUKE: [on phone] This is unbelievable! You won't ever change, will you? . . . Okay, fine. Do what you want, make the arrangements. Now I'm working, we'll finish this later. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: Is everything okay?"
"LUKE: Do you have a sister?"
"LORELAI: Um, no."
"BOY 1: I do."
"LUKE: You have my sympathies."
"BOY 1: Thanks. I appreciate that."

"CUT TO FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke walks towards the diner carrying several shopping bags. He drops a bag on the sidewalk. Lorelai is walking by and stops to help.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hello."
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"LUKE: Ah, just redecorating the sidewalk."
"LORELAI: Oh, it looks nice."
"LUKE: Yeah yeah yeah, you don't think too much blue?"
"LORELAI: No, just enough."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, thanks for the input. You can go now."
"LORELAI: Need some help?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Need some help?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Need some help?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: So do you need some help?"
"[Luke sighs.]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke and Lorelai walk down the hallway to Luke's apartment. Luke is carrying the shopping bags, Lorelai is carrying a box of cereal. Luke unlocks the door.]"
"LORELAI: Frosted Flakes? Since when do you buy Frosted Flakes? [Luke drops some bags, food spills all over.] Okay, now what is going on?"
"LUKE: Nothing."
"LORELAI: Nothing? You just all of sudden woke up this morning and decided you were gonna buy every food item in the world that you don't actually eat?"
"LUKE: It's not for me."
"LORELAI: Well who's it for?"
"LUKE: Someone who's not me."
"LORELAI: Like who?"
"[cut to inside apartment]"
"LUKE: Like my nephew."
"LORELAI: Oh, your nephew's coming to visit."
"LUKE: No, he's coming to stay."
"LORELAI: You're sister's moving here?"
"[they start picking up the spilled food in the hallway and bringing it inside]"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry, I don't get it."
"LUKE: There's nothing to get. It's just Liz. She's too busy, she can't handle him, she's sending him here."
"LORELAI: Where's his dad?"
"LUKE: Oh well, the great prize that my sister picked up at a Der Wienerschnitzel left her about two years ago, whereabouts unknown."
"LORELAI: Aww, geez."
"LUKE: Yup."
"LORELAI: So she's just sending him here, just like that?"
"LUKE: Oh no, I'm sure she put at least five or six minutes of thought into it."
"LORELAI: But why?"
"LUKE: Well, 'cause apparently he's been getting into some trouble and Liz is afraid he's heading for something bad, and rather than handle it herself, she's just giving up. She's sending him here so I can straighten him out."
"LORELAI: You?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: You can straighten him out?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: You, Luke Danes, the great communicator, you're going to straighten the kid out?"
"LUKE: All he needs is a change of pace, a new crowd, and to get away from the nutjob that, unfortunately, is my sister."
"LORELAI: Well, how long is he staying?"
"LUKE: I don't know. Indefinitely."
"LORELAI: And how old is he?"
"LUKE: Seventeen."
"LORELAI: Oh, wow. That is very generous of you."
"LUKE: Well, it's family, what else can you do?"
"LORELAI: Right. So what kind of trouble has he gotten into?"
"LUKE: Ah, just kid stuff, you know, staying out late, getting rowdy. I don't know exactly."
"LORELAI: Well, you might want to find out. Ask a couple of subtle questions, you know, has he seen The Shawshank Redemption, did the setting seem homey to him? Stuff like that."
"LUKE: Look, his problem is obvious, it's his mother. You never could count on Liz for anything. Our mom died when we were kids, right? It was just my dad, me and Liz. And my dad worked all the time and I worked in the store with my dad, and Liz was off doing God knows what."
"LORELAI: Well, I bet losing her mom so early was kind of hard on her."
"LUKE: It was hard on all of us, but we did our part. And then the minute she graduates high school, she is outta here. Didn't matter that my dad was sick, didn't matter that the store was failing, she just took off. Married the hot dog king, had a kid, he left, now here we are. [Luke starts pumping up an air mattress]"
"LORELAI: Yeah, wow, that'sI'm sorry, what are you doing?"
"LUKE: I'm blowing this up."
"LORELAI: What is it?"
"LUKE: It's a bed."
"LORELAI: A bed?"
"LUKE: For Jess."
"LORELAI: Jess?"
"LUKE: Jess, my nephew."
"LORELAI: Luke, um, that's not a bed, that's a raft, which is fine if you're gonna build a moat around the diner but"
"LUKE: It's fine."
"LORELAI: Luke, the kid needs a bed. If you want to get him something inflatable, make it a blonde."
"LUKE: I'm getting him a bed, this is just temporary."
"LORELAI: Hey, how does Jess feel about this?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You haven't talked to him about it?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Don't you think you should?"
"LUKE: Why? He doesn't have a choice. His mom's a flake, he's coming here, end of story."
"LORELAI: Are you sure you're ready for this?"
"LUKE: Of course I'm sure."
"LORELAI: I mean, taking on a full time kid, that's a lot of work."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: And a seventeen-year-old that's been getting into trouble and now is being shipped off without his consent, that could be even harder."
"LUKE: Look, all he needs is to be around someone who's not a selfish basketcase, who will give him a little space, who will treat him like a man."
"LORELAI: Maybe you should think about this."
"LUKE: There's nothing to think about. He's family. You take care of family, period."
"LORELAI: Yes, I respect that, but what if he turns out to be Fredo?"
"LUKE: Are you seriously telling me not to do this?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not telling you not to do this."
"LUKE: Then what are you saying?"
"LORELAI: I'm just saying that if you need any help, I'm here."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"LUKE: Look, I got a lot of things to do before he gets here so"
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm leaving. Oh, you do have an extra set of sheets, right?"
"LUKE: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Sorry, just checking. Bye. [leaves]"
"LUKE: [grabs keys] Sheets, sheets."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory is walking down the hallway towards a classroom. Paris, Madeline and Louise are walking towards the same room from the other direction. They stop in front of the doorway and look at each other before going inside.]"
"RORY: Okay, round two."
"CUT TO INSIDE CLASSROOM"
"[Rory walks over to Paris.]"
"RORY: Five seconds?"
"PARIS: Four."
"RORY: Fine."
"PARIS: Now it's three."
"RORY: Paris, it does not have to be like this."
"PARIS: No?"
"RORY: You and I are going to have to spend a lot of time in class together on The Franklin."
"PARIS: I know."
"RORY: We're gonna have to sit in the same classroom, share the same oxygen, occasionally make eye contact."
"PARIS: I can avoid that."
"RORY: Look, I'm not saying that we should be friends. I don't want to be friends. I'm just saying that maybe we should look at this like life."
"PARIS: Life?"
"RORY: Yes, in life there will be people that you don't like, but that you have to coexist with."
"PARIS: I am well aware of that."
"RORY: So I'm just suggesting that we coexist."
"PARIS: You're just scared that I'm gonna make your life on The Franklin a living hell. Especially since I'm the editor and you'reoh, what's the wordnot."
"RORY: If you want to spend the precious energy that you'd normally spend on the paper obsessing on ways to make me miserable, then that's your choice. I'm just suggesting an alternate plan. The paper could be really great this year."
"PARIS: I know."
"RORY: So, can't we just agree on that and make all the rest of it go away?"
"[Louise and Madeline walk over]"
"LOUISE: Everything okay?"
"RORY: Yeah, Riff, everything's fine."
"PARIS: We were just talking."
"MADELINE: Talking? You two?"
"PARIS: About The Franklin."
"MADELINE: Oh. Nope, still seems weird."
"PARIS: Hey, look, we're all on the paper together. There's gonna be a lot of long afternoons and weekends."
"LOUISE: Weekends?"
"PARIS: We need to coexist, right?"
"RORY: Right."
"LOUISE: I'm sorry. Back up to the weekends."
"PARIS: So that's what we'll do. Now the first meeting of The Franklin is today."
"RORY: Yes it is."
"PARIS: Four o'clock."
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LOUISE: Weekends were never mentioned. I need my weekends. All of this gets done on weekends."
"CUT TO BUSSTOP"
"[Luke is waiting on the bench. The bus pulls up and Jess steps off.]"
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: Luke."
"LUKE: Okay, so uh [Luke walks towards the diner, Jess follows]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke and Jess walk through the door.]"
"LUKE: Well, this is my diner."
"JESS: Huh."
"LUKE: Belonged to your Grandpa."
"JESS: Huh."
"LUKE: Yup."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke and Jess walk through the door.]"
"LUKE: Well, here we are. It's pretty simple. You know, this is the room. That's my bed, that's your, uh, bed for now, but the sheets are new. There's the bathroom, there's the closet, there's the dresser, the phone, and over there is the kitchen. I've got Frosted Flakes."
"JESS: Wow, that's grrrrreat."
"LUKE: So, is that all your stuff?"
"JESS: Yup."
"LUKE: Not much there."
"JESS: Well, Lizzie's sending the rest later."
"LUKE: So, you need some help?"
"JESS: Nope."
"LUKE: Okay, uh, I have to get back to the diner. I'm gonna close up at ten tonight, so I thought"
"JESS: See you at ten."
"LUKE: But wait, you need keys."
"JESS: No I don't. [leaves]"
"LUKE: I so don't wanna know why."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Jess walks out of the diner, looks around the town, and walks down the street.]"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory sits down on a bench to read before the newspaper meeting starts. She hears voices from inside the room and goes inside. Several students and a teacher are sitting at a table.]"
"PARIS: Pick a side people. Oh, Rory."
"RORY: Hey."
"TEACHER: Nice of you to join us, Miss Gilmore."
"RORY: I thought we were starting at four."
"TEACHER: No, we start at 3:15 sharp."
"PARIS: Look, we're wasting time here."
"TEACHER: Take a seat Miss Gilmore."
"RORY: Sorry."
"PARIS: Okay, so we were just finishing up handing out the first assignments. Now, Rory, unfortunately, since you got here so late, most everything of interest has been given out."
"RORY: Why, I'm shocked."
"PARIS: Wait, wait, just let me check my list here. There might be something left for you. Okay, well, here, they're paving the new parking lot tomorrow."
"RORY: And?"
"PARIS: And you can cover it."
"RORY: Cover what?"
"PARIS: The paving process."
"RORY: You're serious?"
"PARIS: Absolutely. I'm sure there's an angle there somewhere. Is it environmentally safe? What are the financial ramifications? Should brick have been considered especially taking into account the architecture of the building?"
"RORY: Yeah yeah, I get the idea."
"PARIS: But hey, if you think this is below you, you can always wait until the next issue. You can just use this time to get a nice manicure."
"RORY: That's okay."
"PARIS: Maybe get a massage."
"RORY: I'll do it."
"PARIS: Aromatherapy. Smell like a peach for a few days."
"RORY: I said I'll do it, okay? I'll cover the paving."
"PARIS: Okay, good. Well then, I guess that's it."
"[Everyone gets up from the table. Paris walks to a computer and starts typing. Rory walks over to her.]"
"PARIS: Problem, Miss Gilmore?"
"RORY: Nope, no problem at all. I love this assignment."
"PARIS: I'm glad."
"RORY: I'm gonna write the greatest piece on pavement you've ever read."
"PARIS: I hope so."
"RORY: And next week, when you give me the scoop on the new copper plumbing installation, I'm gonna be just as thrilled."
"PARIS: I like a team player."
"RORY: And no matter how many crappy, stupid, useless assignments you throw at me, I'm not going to quit and I'm not going to back down. So you can go home tonight and think about the fact that no matter what you do and no matter how evil you are, at the end of the year, on my high school transcript, it's going to say that I worked on The Franklin. So, if you'll excuse me, I have some reading to do on the origins of concrete."
"PARIS: A thousand words on my desk on Tuesday."
"[Rory walks out of the room and starts walking down the hallway. Max is coming from the other direction. They stop in front of each other, then both turn around and go the other way. Paris watches from the classroom window.]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is wiping a table as Lorelai walks into the diner.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"[Luke is startled and spills coffee on the table.]"
"LUKE: Oh geez."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"LUKE: No, I'll justyou want some coffee?"
"LORELAI: It's okay. I'll just lick it off the table. So?"
"LUKE: So what?"
"LORELAI: Is he here?"
"LUKE: He's here."
"LORELAI: Yeah? How is he? [sits at counter]"
"LUKE: He's fine."
"LORELAI: Did he see the bed?"
"LUKE: He saw the bed."
"LORELAI: Well, where is he? I wanna meet him."
"LUKE: Oh, he's out."
"LORELAI: Out where?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You don't?"
"LUKE: No, he just went out."
"LORELAI: You didn't ask him where he was going?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"LUKE: Because he's not two."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but Luke, he's new in town. He doesn't know his way around yet."
"LUKE: Way around what? This is Stars Hollow. You take three left turns and you're back in the center of town."
"LORELAI: Luke, when a kid goes out, you have to at least ask where he's going."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because you're responsible for him now. If he goes and knocks over a liquor store, it's gonna be your fault."
"LUKE: If I had asked him where he was going and he actually intended to knock off a liquor store, do you really think he would've told me that?"
"LORELAI: If he's dumb."
"LUKE: He's fine. New topic."
"[Jess walks into the diner]"
"LUKE: Jess, hey, good. I'd like you to meet someone."
"LORELAI: Hey. Hi, I'm Lorelai. I just wanted to meet you before Luke had a chance to fill your head with all kinds of little lies about me."
"JESS: Hi."
"LORELAI: You know, you should meet my daughter. She's about your age. She can show you where all the good wilding goes on. . . .Okay, well, it's nice to meet you. I hope you like it here. . . . . So, class dismissed."
"LUKE: Uh, are you hungry 'cause I can [Jess goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: So that's Jess?"
"LUKE: Yup."
"LORELAI: Very chatty."
"LUKE: He's adjusting. He just got here. He probably just went out and realized there are twelve stores in this town devoted entirely to peddling porcelain unicorns. I've lived in this town my entire life, I still can't believe it."
"LORELAI: I'm sure that's it."
"LUKE: He'll be fine in a few days."
"LORELAI: Hey, listen, I have a fabulous idea. What are you doing tomorrow night?"
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Why don't you and Jess come over for dinner?"
"LUKE: Dinner?"
"LORELAI: Sookie will cook, Rory will be there. It'll be a little 'Hey, welcome to Stars Hollow and see, everyone here's not straight out of a Fellini film' kind of an evening."
"LUKE: Okay, that would be nice, thanks."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"LUKE: You won't bring up the bed?"
"LORELAI: Oh no, I'll definitely bring up the bed."
"[Luke walks away. Rory walks in and sits at the counter next to Lorelai.]"
"RORY: Oh my God, I hate her."
"LORELAI: Ah, me too."
"RORY: You have no idea who I'm talking about."
"LORELAI: Solidarity sister."
"RORY: Paris."
"LORELAI: Ugh. Well, that I should've guessed."
"RORY: She thinks she can torture me off the paper and she can't."
"LORELAI: No, she can't."
"RORY: I have never met anyone like her before. Her insistence on holding onto this stupid grudge that is based on nothing and will never ever end shows an amount of commitment that I would've never thought possible. I'm beginning to admire her."
"LORELAI: First day sucked?"
"RORY: Just the paper stuff sucked, the rest of the stuff was good."
"LORELAI: Good, I'm glad to hear it. Did you happen to run into Max?"
"RORY: Actually, no."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: Yeah, our paths just didn't cross."
"LORELAI: Isn't he your Lit teacher?"
"RORY: Yeah, but I do have really tall people sitting in front of me."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I saw him in the hallway and I walked the other way and"
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: I don't know. I thought that's what you'd want me to do."
"LORELAI: Just because Max isn't apart of my life anymore doesn't mean he can't be apart of yours. He has to be apart of yours. You have to see him and talk to him, and that's okay. That's good. I know everything seems screwed up right now, but I don't want you to avoid him, especially not on my account. Okay?"
"RORY: All right."
"LORELAI: I am sorry that I put you in this position."
"RORY: That's okay. It's going on the list."
"LORELAI: My God, that list is getting long."
"RORY: You have no idea."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Lorelai come out of Luke's and walk down the sidewalk.]"
"LORELAI: We are having a little gathering tomorrow night."
"RORY: What kind of gathering?"
"LORELAI: Well, Luke's nephew's here, and I thought we could try to make him feel a little more at home."
"RORY: Did you meet him?"
"LORELAI: Sort of."
"RORY: What's he like?"
"LORELAI: Well, he's not gonna be subbing for the new dodo on the Regis show any time soon, let's put in like that."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Jess is sitting on his bed smoking and shuffling cards as Luke walks in.]"
"LUKE: So you get unpacked?"
"JESS: Yup."
"LUKE: Get enough space in the closet?"
"JESS: Plenty."
"LUKE: You hungry?"
"JESS: Eighteen."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: Just counting how many questions 'til we hit twenty."
"LUKE: Okay, never mind. [phone rings, Luke answers] Yeah? Yeah, Liz, he got here fine."
"JESS: Got here at ten this morning."
"LUKE: Okay, hang on a sec. Jess? [holds out the phone]"
"JESS: Pass."
"LUKE: Jess, come on."
"JESS: Nope."
"LUKE: What am I supposed to tell her?"
"JESS: Tell her I gotta take another crack at that closet. You know, I think I hung my Tool T-shirt next to my Metallica T-shirt and they don't really get along."
"LUKE: You really want me to tell her that?"
"JESS: You think a different band combo would sell it more?"
"LUKE: [on phone] Yeah, Liz, Jess is gonna have to call you back. Yeah, he's helping me out with a shelf thing and his hand are fullYeah, I'll tell him. Okay, bye. [hangs up] She said to tell you that your stuff will be here on Friday."
"JESS: Great, we'll have a party."
"LUKE: You know, your mom thinks this is. . .you know, for the best and for your own good and. . . Anyhow, I guess you'll just call her when you feel like it."
"JESS: You wanna play some poker? Five bucks a hand?"
"LUKE: No."
"JESS: Ten?"
"LUKE: No."
"JESS: I can't go any higher than ten."
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: Okay, fifteen"
"LUKE: Yeah, I don't wanna play poker."
"JESS: You sure?"
"LUKE: I'm sure."
"JESS: Okie dokie."
"LUKE: So, listen, Lorelai - you met her today, remember? Anyhow, um, she invited us to her house tomorrow night for dinner. Her daughter Rory, who you didn't meet but you'll like 'cause she's a lot like Lorelai, but she's got a slightly tighter grasp on reality. Anyhow, she'll be there, and you know, it'd be aI don't know, it'd be a chance for you to meet more people and so I, I said yes."
"[Jess grabs his coat and walks out.]"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory is sitting alone at the table waiting for the newspaper meeting to start. Paris walks in.]"
"PARIS: Oh, hello."
"RORY: Hi."
"PARIS: You're early."
"RORY: Yeah, well I felt so bad about the mix up last time, I wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. It won't."
"[Other students walk in for the meeting and sit at the table.]"
"MADELINE: Hey, did you hear that Kimber Slately and Tristin are a major item?"
"LOUISE: I thought that Kimber and Shawn Asher were this year's John and Jackie."
"MADELINE: Nope, Shawn is with Deeds McGuire now, which pushed Jeff Trainer into Dottie Lords' arms leaving Madison Maylands alone for the first weekend since he became captain of the lacrosse team."
"LOUISE: Wow, you know so much so soon. You have a gift."
"MADELINE: I know. Hey Paris, what do you think about me writing a gossip column for The Franklin?"
"PARIS: Huh. I don't know. That's a hard one. I mean, this is The Franklin, a newspaper that's been around for almost a hundred years. There have been at least ten former editors of The Franklin that have gone on to work at the New York Times. Six have gone onto the Washington Post. Three are contributing editors at the New Yorker. I think one even went on to win the Pullitzer Prize. But never mind them. I could be the first editor in the history of The Franklin to introduce a column exclusively devoted to who Biffy's boffing today. Quandary. You know, I'm gonna have to get back to you on that one."
"MADELINE: Okay."
"TEACHER: Oh good, we're all here. And prompt, lovely. Well, I've read everyone's article, and they were all extremely well done. Snappy, informative, well-researched. Paris, you should be very proud of the team you've assembled here this year."
"PARIS: Thank you."
"TEACHER: I mean, when you've got a reporter who can take an incredibly mundane and seemingly unimportant subject like the re-paving of the faculty parking lot and turn it into a bittersweet piece on how everybody and everything eventually becomes obsolete, then you've really got something. Miss Gilmore, I was touched."
"RORY: I owe it all to Paris."
"TEACHER: I would strongly advise that next time you give Miss Gilmore something with a little more meat to it."
"PARIS: Oh, yeah, great idea."
"TEACHER: Okay, let's get down to work here. We've got a layout to put together."
"[Rory walks to a computer and sits down. Paris walks over to her.]"
"PARIS: Well, congratulations."
"RORY: Thank you."
"PARIS: You must be very proud of yourself."
"RORY: Well, I'm not hiding when I pass a mirror."
"PARIS: I guess it's part of my job as editor to make sure that our best writer's are writing our best pieces, so I'm going to give you one of our best pieces."
"RORY: Uh huh."
"PARIS: Front page, lead story, above the fold."
"RORY: Get to the catch Paris."
"PARIS: No catch."
"RORY: No catch?"
"PARIS: I'd like to start out year off with a profile on the teacher voted most popular from the year before. You know, an in-depth, no holds barred interview. Everybody wants it. You have it."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"PARIS: Nope."
"RORY: Well, thanks."
"PARIS: You're welcome. So go ahead and set up that interview with Mr. Medina as soon as possible."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: I know it's short notice but I'd love it to lead off the first edition."
"RORY: Mr. Medina?"
"PARIS: He was the winner by a landslide."
"RORY: But"
"PARIS: I'm sorry, is there a problem? I mean, is there some reason why you wouldn't want to interview him? After all, you of all people should be able to get the most in-depth story out of him, especially since he and your mother are involved. They are still involved, aren't they?"
"RORY: Let's just leave my mother's personal life out of this, okay?"
"PARIS: Oh, that sounds bad."
"RORY: It's not bad, it's just none of your business."
"PARIS: Fine. You want the interview or not?"
"RORY: Yes, I want the interview."
"PARIS: Good. Get me something more than his favorite color, okay?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Sookie and Jackson are in the kitchen cooking.]"
"SOOKIE: Maybe I should make grilled cheese."
"JACKSON: But you're making pot roast."
"SOOKIE: But not everybody likes pot roast."
"JACKSON: Well, then they can have the chicken wings, the mashed potatoes, the four different kinds of salad that you're making in addition to the pot roast."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, I guess you're right."
"JACKSON: So I should start slicing the cheese?"
"SOOKIE: Would you? Oh, that'd be great."
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, something smells good."
"SOOKIE: It's the garlic."
"JACKSON: Three heads of it."
"LORELAI: Nice."
"SOOKIE: I want everything to be perfect. We are gonna make this kid think that he died and went to heaven."
"JACKSON: Or Henry the Eighth's house."
"[Lorelai knocks on Rory's bedroom door.]"
"LORELAI: Milady?"
"RORY: Come in."
"[Lorelai opens the door, Rory is sitting at her computer.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you joining the festivities?"
"RORY: In a sec."
"LORELAI: You sound crabby."
"RORY: I'm concentrating."
"LORELAI: Okay, don't concentrate too hard. Boys like 'em dumb, right Jackson?"
"JACKSON: If you can navigate yourself around a tree, keep on walking."
"[There's a knock at the front door]"
"LORELAI: Coming!"
"SOOKIE: What if he doesn't do dairy?"
""
""
""
"CUT TO FRONT HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai opens the front door, Luke and Jess are standing there.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, perfect timing. Sookie's about to break her own record for the most food served outside the Roman Empire."
"LUKE: Sounds great."
"JESS: Sure does."
"LORELAI: So, come on in."
"[They walk inside. Jess goes into the living as Luke and Lorelai keep talking in the hallway.]"
"LUKE: Sorry we're a little late. We had a little misunderstanding about what time we're actually supposed to leave to come here."
"LORELAI: It's okay. How's it going?"
"LUKE: Oh, well, not bad. Oh, the bed popped."
"LORELAI: Yikes. Was anyone in it?"
"LUKE: Me."
"LORELAI: You?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I let him take the real one."
"LORELAI: Well, that was very nice of you. Hey Jess. Wanna come on in the kitchen?"
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson, I want you to meet Luke's nephew. This is Jess."
"SOOKIE: Do you eat cheese?"
"JESS: What?"
"JACKSON: Oh my God, this is the greatest lemon I have ever grown. I mean, this is a great lemon. Sookie, you gotta try this lemon. Isn't it a great lemon?"
"SOOKIE: That is a great lemon."
"JACKSON: Try it, it's a Meyer."
"LORELAI: Jackson grows fruit and then scares people with it. Rory, they're here."
"RORY: Coming. [sees Jess] Hey."
"JESS: Hey. [walks into Rory's room]"
"RORY: I'm Rory."
"JESS: Yeah, I figured."
"RORY: Nice to meet you."
"JESS: [looking at bookshelf] Wow, aren't we hooked on phonics."
"RORY: Oh, I read a lot. Do you read?"
"JESS: Not much. [takes a book off the shelf]"
"RORY: I could loan you that if you want. It's great."
"JESS: No thanks. [puts it down]"
"RORY: Well, if you change your mind"
"LORELAI: [from the doorway] Okay, we really need to get Jackson away from the lemons now, so we're moving the feast in the living room. [walks away]"
"RORY: Be right there."
"JESS: So do these open? [looking at windows]"
"RORY: Oh yeah, you just have to unlatch them and then push."
"JESS: Great. Shall we?"
"RORY: Shall we what?"
"JESS: Bail."
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Why?"
"RORY: Because it's Tuesday night in Stars Hollow. There's nowhere to bail to. The 24-hour mini-mart just closed twenty minutes ago."
"JESS: So we'll walk around or sit on a bench and stare at our shoes."
"RORY: Look, Sookie just made a ton of really great food, and I'm starving and though it may not seem like it right at this moment, it's gonna be fun. Trust me."
"JESS: I don't even know you."
"RORY: Well, don't I look trustworthy?"
"JESS: Maybe."
"RORY: Okay, good. Let's eat. [walks into kitchen] You want a soda?"
"JESS: Oh, I'll get it."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Rory gets a soda and walks into the living room. Jess walks to the fridge, takes out a beer, and goes out the back door.]"
"CUT TO LIVING ROOM"
"[A table is set up in the living room. Everyone stands around it loading up their plates.]"
"SOOKIE: You know ham was originally made out of rice?"
"JACKSON: What?"
"SOOKIE: Mm hmm."
"LORELAI: Sookie"
"LUKE: Hey Rory, where's Jess?"
"RORY: He's getting a soda."
"LORELAI: Here. [hands Luke a plate]"
"LUKE: I'm sorry, you must've mistaken me for you."
"LORELAI: Ooh, too much?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, I forgot the garlic bread."
"LORELAI: I'll get it."
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks in, takes the bread out of the oven, then looks around for Jess. She walks out the back door.]"
"CUT TO BACK PORCH"
"[Lorelai walks out and finds Jess opening the beer.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, for me, hey, thanks. [takes a sip] Refreshing. So what, you're not hungry?"
"JESS: Not really."
"LORELAI: Well, Sookie made you some grilled cheese if you don't like pot roast."
"JESS: Oh, well, if I'd had known that"
"LORELAI: Let me guess, you don't want to be here?"
"JESS: Doesn't matter."
"LORELAI: I mean, here in Stars Hollow."
"JESS: Well geez, Ms. Gilmore, why would anyone not want to be here in Stars Hollow? That just sounds plum crazy."
"LORELAI: Ugh, Jess, let me give you a little advice. The whole 'my parents don't get me' thing, I've been there."
"JESS: You have, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I have. I've also done the 'chip on my shoulder' bit. Ooh, and the surly, sarcastic, 'the world can bite my ass' bit, and let me tell you, I mastered them all, in heels, yet. And everything you're feeling might be totally justified, maybe you are getting screwed. But Luke is a great guy. He's very special, and he really wants to take care of you and make things right for you. You're incredibly lucky to have him. If you give this situation half a chance, you might be surprised at how good it can be, how much you like living here, and how comfortable it feels to have someone like Luke you can really depend on."
"JESS: What are you sleeping with him or something?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"JESS: I don't know. The whole starry eyed 'you're so much better off, just give it a chance' speech. You're either really naïve, or you're getting some."
"LORELAI: Ugh. There have been very few moments in my life where I have actually wished I had one of those enormous cream pies you can just smash in someone's face, but this is definitely one of them."
"JESS: Well, now, that's not very neighborly."
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what, this is my house, and I choose how I get talked to in it, ha ha."
"JESS: You know, you don't know anything about me, or my life, or my mom, or Luke, so why don't you Doctor Laura someone else."
"LORELAI: I'm going inside, stay out of my fridge."
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks in from the back door and starts putting the garlic bread in a basket. Luke walks in.]"
"LUKE: Where's Jess?"
"LORELAI: Outside working on his ""Breakfast Club"" audition. He's getting good."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Luke, I'm sorry. That kid is way more screwed up than you think he is."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: I catch him outside with a beer, I don't even bust him on it, I justI try talking to him"
"LUKE: What do you mean, talk to him? What did you say?"
"LORELAI: I said he's got a good thing going here with you and he shouldn't blow it, and then, well then he just got charming."
"LUKE: What are you doing talking to him about stuff like that?"
"LORELAI: I'm trying to help you."
"LUKE: I don't need your help."
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah you do."
"LUKE: Oh, here we go again with this 'I'm not prepared for this' crap."
"LORELAI: This is not crap, this is the truth. Luke, you should've heard him talking."
"LUKE: I don't need to hear him talking, he's my nephew and I know what I'm doing. And I'm getting a little tired of your condescending"
"LORELAI: I am not being condescending."
"LUKE: Oh, you have a kid, so you know everything, right?"
"LORELAI: I have a kid, so yeah, I know a little more than you do."
"LUKE: You know, you ever think maybe you just got lucky with Rory? I mean, you did get pregnant at sixteen. That doesn't show the greatest decision making k*ll, now does it?"
"LORELAI: Wow, two pies."
"LUKE: What the hell you talking about?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. I'm talking about nothing. And you won't have to hear my opinion on anything ever again, okay?"
"LUKE: Oh, don't tease."
"LORELAI: Go find Jess. [walks away]"
"LUKE: Don't tell me what to do. [goes out the back door]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory are Lorelai are standing in front of the diner.]"
"RORY: You're being completely childish."
"LORELAI: Am not."
"RORY: So what, we're never gonna go into Luke's again? We're just gonna starve?"
"LORELAI: Rory, this was a bad one, okay? This was not Nick and Nora, this was Sid and Nancy, and I'm not going in there."
"RORY: But the coffee is in there. And it's Danish Day. Are you seriously telling me that you're gonna let a stupid fight get in the way of Danish Day?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: So go in there and order two coffees and two Danishes to go."
"RORY: You're kidding, right?"
"LORELAI: And don't forget the napkins."
"RORY: Mom, he's gonna know what's going on. He's not stupid."
"LORELAI: He cannot prove that you're not ordering all that for yourself, can he? No, so go on. Scoot, scoot. Mommy's right here."
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S"
"[Rory walks up to Luke at the counter.]"
"RORY: Hey Luke."
"LUKE: Rory."
"RORY: Um, I'll have two coffees and two cherry Danishes to go, please."
"LUKE: Two coffees and two cherry Danishes."
"RORY: Oh, and some napkins."
"LUKE: One of these is for her isn't it?"
"RORY: Who? Oh, no no no. They're all for me. I am super hungry today. I was debating ordering three, but I'll tell you how I feel after two."
"LUKE: Tell you what, I'll give you one Danish and one cup of coffee, you can sit over there and eat, and when you're finished them right over there where I can see you, then I'll bring you a second one."
"RORY: You're really just gonna stand there and watch me eat a Danish?"
"LUKE: Cable's out. I'm starved for entertainment."
"RORY: Okay, this is insane. So you guys had a fight, big deal. You know you're gonna make up anyway, and what better day to make up than Danish Day, the happiest of all days. The day when we all say, 'hey, let's forgive and forget over a nice Danish and a cup coffee.'"
"LUKE: One Danish, one cup of coffee, take it or leave it."
"RORY: I'll take it. I still think you're being silly."
"[Luke hands her a cup of coffee and a paper bag.]"
"LUKE: Thank you for sharing. Come back soon."
"CUT TO FRONT OF DINER"
"[Rory walks out carrying the bag and the coffee and walks over to Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: Well?"
"RORY: He would only sell me one."
"LORELAI: Ugh! Didn't you say they were both for you?"
"RORY: Yes I did, and he knew that I was lying."
"LORELAI: Did you do the blinky thing? You always do the blinky thing when you're lying."
"RORY: I didn't have to do the blinky thing. He knows you well enough to know that you're not gonna go a whole day with no coffee and especially no Danish."
"LORELAI: Ugh!"
"RORY: Why don't you go in there now and just make up?"
"LORELAI: Why don't you give me half your Danish and some coffee?"
"RORY: I'll give you the Danish but I'm keeping the coffee."
"LORELAI: What is a Danish without coffee?"
"RORY: The eternal question springs up again."
"LORELAI: There's no point in even eating a Danish without coffee."
"RORY: I'm going to school."
"LORELAI: Sad Danish, lonely Danish, step Danish."
"RORY: I'll see you tonight. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: But [sees a little boy crossing the street] Hey, kid, do me a favor? Come here."
"[Luke watches through the window as Lorelai tries to get the kid to buy her coffee.]"
"LORELAI: Please, please"
"[the kid runs away, Lorelai looks at the diner and pouts. The phone rings in the diner; Luke answers]"
"LUKE: Luke'swhat is it Taylor? Slow down, you're babbling. Well, how do you know it was Jess? . . . Okay, Taylor, I'll talk to him, but if he tells me he didn't do it and nobody saw him do it, then he is off the hook, understand? [hangs up]"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory walks down the hallway and stops in front of a door. She pauses a second before walking inside. Inside the classroom, Max is sitting at a desk.]"
"RORY: Hi."
"MAX: Rory, hi."
"RORY: Am I too early? 'Cause I can"
"MAX: No, no."
"RORY: come back some other time."
"MAX: This is fine."
"RORY: Tomorrow maybe."
"MAX: Now is good."
"RORY: This is weird."
"MAX: Yeah, it is."
"RORY: I don't really know how to act."
"MAX: I'm not completely sure of that myself. We could sit."
"RORY: Sit, sure, that's good. Barbara Walters sits, or walks sometimes if the person she's talking to has a horse or a ranch or a big backyard sometimes, but usually she just sits. Okay, so I guess we should just start. [she sits across from him]"
"MAX: Good idea."
"RORY: Do you mind if I tape this?"
"MAX: Oh, no, not at all."
"RORY: Okay. [turns on tape recorder] So I guess I'll just dive in. Full name?"
"MAX: Max Arturo Medina."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"MAX: No, I'm not."
"RORY: Where does that come from?"
"MAX: My father's butcher was named Arturo."
"RORY: Really?"
"MAX: And when my mother was pregnant with me, she went through this phase where all she would eat was lamb chops. So Arturo would cut her the extra large lamb chops and only charge her for the regular sized lamb chops, which in my family made you eligible for sainthood."
"RORY: Hence the Arturo."
"MAX: That's right."
"RORY: Well, I assume that you are aware that you were overwhelmingly voted the student's favorite teacher last year."
"MAX: I teach an exceptional bunch of young people. I'm glad they seem to like me as much as I like them."
"RORY: Have you ever thought of doing something other than teaching?"
"MAX: Well, my father wanted me to be a doctor, and my mother wanted me to be President, and I wanted to be. . . a clown."
"RORY: What?"
"MAX: When I was a kid, I went to the circus and I saw this man who was dressed in this crazy outfit, and he could juggle and he rode on an elephant and the people loved him and I thought, 'Well, that's it. That's for me.'"
"RORY: How long did that last?"
"MAX: Junior high. And then slowly I figured out that I wanted to teach. Plus, when you told people that you wanted to be a clown they tended to get very frightened."
"RORY: Mom took me to the circus once, when I was really little and, um, this clown knocked into me and I dropped my cotton candy, and we didn't have a lot of money back then so she couldn't buy me another one, and I started crying. So she literally chased the clown on stage, ripped off his wig and said she wouldn't give it back to him unless he bought me another cotton candy."
"MAX: Which I bet he did."
"RORY: It was twice as big as the first one and I threw up all the way home."
"MAX: Yeah, that sounds like your mom."
"RORY: Do you ever regret the fact that you didn't become a clown?"
"MAX: I don't really believe in regrets. All my experiences, even the ones that didn't turn out the way I wanted them to, I firmly believe they were all worth it."
"[Rory turns off the tape recorder]"
"RORY: I just want you to know, I really wanted you to be my stepfather."
"MAX: I just want you to know, I really wanted to be your stepfather."
"[They're silent for a few seconds, then Rory turns back on tape recorder.]"
"RORY: So, what would you say are the great challenges facing high school graduates today?"
"MAX: Well, a myriad of things really"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Luke is waiting out front as Jess walks out.]"
"LUKE: Hey. How was school?"
"JESS: Great."
"LUKE: You learn anything good?"
"JESS: Oh yeah, tons of things. I've got gold stars plastered all over my forehead."
"LUKE: I had an interesting call today. Wanna know who it was from?"
"JESS: Not really."
"LUKE: It was from Taylor Doose, you know he owns the market."
"JESS: If you say so."
"LUKE: He said you came in today."
"JESS: He did?"
"LUKE: And he said you took some money out of a little donation cup to help repair the bridge. I told him he was crazy, you wouldn't do that, you weren't a thief, that he was just trying to start trouble, then I hung up on him. But don't get me wrong, I enjoy hanging up on Taylor, and he is crazy, but I was just wondering if maybe any of the other things he said were true."
"JESS: What do you think?"
"LUKE: I think that if you tell me that what he's saying is not true, then I'm gonna believe it's not true."
"JESS: Okay, it's not true."
"LUKE: That doesn't sound very convincing."
"JESS: Look, what exactly do you want from me? You bring me here to this place, you put me in a school that says the Pledge of Allegiance in six different languages, two of which I've never heard of before. You take me away from my home, my friends, and now you want what from me?"
"LUKE: I'm trying to help you."
"JESS: Well, stop trying. Stop talking to me, stop following me, and stop asking me questions. Just stop."
"LUKE: That's what you want?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: That's really what you want?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: Fine, you got it."
"JESS: Thank you."
"LUKE: You're welcome."
"[As they both walk away over a bridge, Luke pushes Jess into the lake.]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Rory's sitting at the kitchen table doing homework as Lorelai comes home.]"
"LORELAI: Rory?"
"RORY: Kitchen."
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen and takes a bag of coffee from the fridge]"
"LORELAI: Nowhere in either Stars Hollow or it's surrounding counties can you get a decent cup of coffee. I swear, it's like a big stupid coffee conspiracy."
"RORY: Why don't you just pour the water right into the bag?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you jest, but believe me, the thought has crossed my mind. It's looking better and better all the time. Where are you going? I'm not through complaining."
"RORY: I just have to get some more notes I need."
"LORELAI: Hmm. What's this?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: This that you're working on?"
"RORY: Oh, that's my interview with Max."
"LORELAI: What interview with Max?"
"RORY: The paper wanted to do a piece on the student's favorite teacher from the previous year and Paris assigned it to me when she caught wind of the fact that. . ."
"LORELAI: Wow, nice kid that Paris."
"RORY: Yeah. It wasn't that bad though."
"LORELAI: No?"
"RORY: No. It was actually good. It gave us a chance to talk about some things."
"LORELAI: Well good."
"RORY: Yeah, it was good. Well, I'm gonna buy a folder for it before the store closes."
"LORELAI: Okay. Some good writing here, missy."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Really good."
"RORY: It's not quite up to the re-paving piece yet but I'll get it there."
"LORELAI: Hmm. Boy, he sounds like a hell of a guy, doesn't he?"
"RORY: Yeah, he does. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: I sure know how to dump 'em, don't I?"
"[there's a knock at the back door; Lorelai opens it, Luke walks in.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: I just pushed him in a lake."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Jess. I got this call from Taylor that he thinks Jess stole the bridge money and I went to confront him and he was being impossible and I just pushed him in a lake. This is bad."
"LORELAI: That depends, can he swim?"
"LUKE: He's fine. He's wet. I just, I lost it, you know. You were right. I am in so far over my head that I can't see my own hat."
"LORELAI: Try turning it around"
"LUKE: What was I thinking? Why did I say yes to this?"
"LORELAI: Because you saw a kid in desperate need of some help and you thought you would throw him a line."
"LUKE: But me, raising a kid? I don't even like kids. They're always sticky, you know, like they've got jam on their hands. Even if there's no jam in the house, somehow they've always got jam on their hands. I'm not the right guy to deal with that. I have no patience for jam hands."
"LORELAI: Luke, slow down. First of all, Jess is seventeen, so I think he's probably past the jam hands stage by now. And second of all, you can do this. If you want to, you are totally capable. But you can't just buy a bed and some sheets and expect the rest to take care of itself. That will not work."
"LUKE: I swear, I'm gonna k*ll Liz."
"LORELAI: Hey, Liz is not the point anymore. Liz is not here, Jess is here. Focus on him. What are you gonna do about him?"
"[Babette walks in the back door.]"
"BABETTE: Lorelai, sugah? I hate to bother you, but have you seen Pierpont?"
"LORELAI: Um no. Why?"
"BABETTE: It's the darndest thing. I came out just now and I noticed that he was gone. Just like that."
"LUKE: I'm sorry, who's missing?"
"BABETTE: Pierpont, gorgeous."
"LORELAI: Her gnome."
"LUKE: Her gnome?"
"BABETTE: The one with the pipe."
"LUKE: Oh."
"BABETTE: Oh God, I hope nothing's happened to him. You get so attached to their little faces, sometimes you can hear them talk to you at night."
"LUKE: You know, I wouldn't worry Babette. I think you're gonna see Pierpont again really soon. [walks to the front door]"
"LORELAI: Oh, where you going?"
"LUKE: I have to take care of something. I'll see you tomorrow at the diner for your Danish, right?"
"LORELAI: Tomorrow isn't Danish Day."
"LUKE: Just be there."
"LORELAI: Yes, sir."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Jess is on his bed smoking; Luke walks in with a bag and starts dropping things on his bed.]"
"LUKE: Okay, we got the patch, the gum, hypnosis tapes, Chinese herbs, self-help books, and several pictures of diseased lungs to hang on the fridge. Pretty, huh? This is done. [puts out his cigarette]"
"JESS: Hey!"
"LUKE: You will get up, you will go to school, you will come home, you will work in the diner until closing, you will do your homework and then you will go to bed. Where's the gnome?"
"JESS: The what?"
"LUKE: The weekends are for chores and selected pre-approved outings, i.e. cavalla studies, freeway beautification projects, Color Me Mine pottery painting, all discussible options. You will not steal, you will pay back Taylor Doose, you will graduate for high school, and you will return Pierpont to his yard."
"JESS: You can't just"
"LUKE: I can just. I am not letting you just fall off the face of the earth. You will not drift, I won't let it happen. Now I don't know if this is the right way to handle this, but this is the way it's being handled, and that my friend, is the end of this discussion. [Jess gets up and walks away] Where are you going?"
"JESS: Out. [leaves]"
"LUKE: Well, at least I asked."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Jess is walking down the street and sees Rory come out of a store. He walks over to her.]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey yourself."
"JESS: What are you doing out here?"
"RORY: I needed something for school. What about you?"
"JESS: Oh yeah, same thing."
"RORY: Uh huh. So, that was quite a disappearing act you pulled the other night."
"JESS: Potlucks and Tupperware parties aren't really my thing."
"RORY: Too cool for school, huh?"
"JESS: Yes, that is me."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"JESS: Oh this? Nothing. [does an illusion with a coin] Just another little disappearing act."
"RORY: Little tip?"
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: If you ever want to speak to me again, don't pull that out of my ear."
"JESS: So I assume the nose is off limits too?"
"RORY: Any place you wouldn't naturally find a coin, let's leave it that way."
"JESS: So what are you doing now?"
"RORY: I have some homework to finish."
"JESS: Okay, then I'll leave you this last little trick. [hands her a book]"
"RORY: You bought a copy? I told you I'd lend you mine."
"JESS: It is yours."
"RORY: You stole my book."
"JESS: Nope, borrowed it."
"RORY: Okay, that's not called a trick, that's called a felony."
"JESS: I just wanted to put some notes in the margins for you."
"RORY: What? [looks through the book] You've read this before."
"JESS: About forty times."
"RORY: I thought you said you didn't read much."
"JESS: Well, what is much? Goodnight Rory."
"RORY: Goodnight Dodger."
"JESS: Dodger?"
"RORY: Figure it out."
"JESS: Oliver Twist."
"[Rory smiles and nods. They both walk away.]"

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings, the maid answers it; Lorelai and Rory are standing there.]"
"MAID: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"MAID: Hello."
"LORELAI: You're new."
"MAID: Uh, I started yesterday."
"LORELAI: What's your name?"
"MAID: Liesl."
"LORELAI: Okay, Liesl. I'm Brigitta, this is Gretl. And, uh, Emily and Richard are expecting us."
"LIESL: Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk inside; they hear Emily and Richard arguing upstairs.]"
"LIESL: Uh, can I, uh, get you a drink?"
"LORELAI: You know what, that's okay. I can get it. Why don't you go hide in the kitchen?"
"LIESL: Really? Thank you. [walks away]"
"RORY: What is going on?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I think George and Martha are joining us for dinner."
"[Lorelai and Rory watch Emily and Richard fighting on the steps.]"
"RICHARD: I didn't know that my every conversation needed to be reported to you. I stand corrected."
"EMILY: I have been the co-chair of the Starlight Foundation for the last eight years."
"RICHARD: I know this, Emily."
"EMILY: And the Black and White Ball is the main fundraising event of the season."
"RICHARD: It's one year."
"EMILY: The co-chair cannot miss the main fundraising event."
"RICHARD: Why? Won't the chair be there?"
"EMILY: Is this a joke to you?"
"RICHARD: Emily, I have too many things to take care of at work. I don't have time for frivolous parties."
"EMILY: Frivolous parties? Friv. . . .[walks up the steps]"
"RICHARD: Well, where are you going? Oh, come back here. [follows her]"
"RORY: Wow, this is bad."
"LORELAI: I know, I wish we had popcorn."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Shh. Incoming."
"[Emily and Richard come back down the steps. Emily reads from a stack of invitations.]"
"EMILY: The Hartford Zoological Silent Auction, the Mark Twain House Restoration Fund luncheon, the Harriet Beecher Stowe Literacy Auction."
"RICHARD: I can read those myself, you know."
"EMILY: This is the fourth event you've taken upon yourself to turn down on our behalf. And I am on the board of all of those foundations. Now how do you think that makes me look?"
"RICHARD: Like your husband is busy and has a great deal of responsibility."
"EMILY: Well, I have responsibilities too."
"RICHARD: I understand that your social engagements are important."
"EMILY: They're not just social engagements."
"RICHARD: Anything at which you serve tea is a social engagement."
"EMILY: That's it. I am gonna get a tape recorder so you can hear how pompous and condescending you sound."
"RICHARD: Wha...uh...Emily."
"EMILY: No, I wouldn't want you to take my word for it. I might be delirious from all that tea I've been drinking. [walks upstairs]"
"RICHARD: Oh stop this. [follows her]"
"RORY: Maybe we should leave."
"LORELAI: Are you kidding? We've got dinner theater here."
"RORY: But Grandma and Grandpa are obviously in a fight."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"RORY: One that they probably wouldn't want us to see."
"LORELAI: Hey, we stumbled in here completely innocently. We came for dinner as usual, per their request. We had no idea we were walking into The Lion King without the puppet heads."
"[They come back downstairs. Emily follows Richard holding out a tape recorder.]"
"RICHARD: Get that thing out of my face."
"EMILY: Just say the tea thing again."
"RICHARD: You are behaving like a child."
"EMILY: Turn around when you talk, would you? I'm not sure how good this microphone is."
"RICHARD: [sees Lorelai and Rory] Oh."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: [claps] Brava! Encore! I'm sorry, does Terrence McNally know about you too? Get me the phone!"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter. Lorelai is reading Rory's homework.]"
"RORY: It sucks. I know it sucks, just tell me it sucks."
"LORELAI: It's great."
"RORY: No it's not."
"LORELAI: It's an A."
"RORY: Don't lie."
"LORELAI: A-plus."
"RORY: You're my mom."
"LORELAI: Is anything higher than an A-plus?"
"RORY: You have to say that."
"LORELAI: It's an A-plus with a crown and a wand."
"RORY: This is not how you raise a child. You don't send them out there with a false sense of pride because out there, in the real world, no one will coddle you. I'd rather know right now if I'm gonna be working at CNN or carrying a basket around it's offices with sandwiches in it."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: It's great."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Really really."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[Luke walks over and fills their mugs.]"
"LUKE: Coffeecoffee. Okay, what do you want? Eggs, toast, combo?"
"LORELAI: What's the rush there, Zippy?"
"LUKE: I'm just swamped this morning. I was supposed to have help but I don't. So order right now or I'm bringing the both of you an egg white omelet with a side of steamed spinach."
"LORELAI: Pancakes."
"RORY: French toast."
"LUKE: Thank you. [Jess walks into the diner from the stairway] Jess, you were supposed to be down here. . . .what the hell is that?"
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: That."
"JESS: That is a shirt."
"LUKE: Change."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: Go upstairs and change your shirt."
"JESS: I like this shirt."
"LUKE: How can you like that shirt?"
"JESS: It brings out my eyes."
"LUKE: Hey, part of the deal of you staying here is that you work here, and when you work here you will wear proper work attire, and that is not proper work attire. Now go upstairs and change into something that won't scare the hell out of my customers."
"JESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke. [goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Gross shirt."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Good band."
"RORY: Oh yeah."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily is having tea on the back patio with three friends.]"
"EMILY: Thank you."
"MAID: Mm hmm. [walks away]"
"LADY 1: Another new one, Emily?"
"EMILY: Yes. The last one only made it through one evening. Thoroughly nervous creature."
"LADY 2: What do you do to them, Em?"
"EMILY: Oh, the usual. Clean this, cook that, sacrifice a virgin on your way out."
"LADY 1: [laughs] The things you say."
"LADY 2: We could've done with some of that at the ball the other night."
"EMILY: Why, was it dull?"
"LADY 2: I felt as if my shoes were going out of style as I sat there."
"EMILY: What a shame."
"LADY 3: Now, Nattie, it wasn't all dull. Are we forgetting Truly Bishop?"
"NATTIE: Oh, that's right."
"EMILY: What, what about Truly Bishop?"
"LADY 3: Well, you know she and Eugene split up last month."
"EMILY: What?"
"NATTIE: Oh Em! You knew about that. They had this huge fight at the. . oh that's right, you missed the Schafer's cocktail party."
"EMILY: They broke up at the Schafer's cocktail party?"
"NATTIE: He has another family in Salisbury."
"EMILY: No!"
"LADY 3: She's 26, with a 2 year old."
"EMILY: How did Truly find out?"
"NATTIE: The little tart sent her a letter."
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LADY 1: So Truly confronted Eugene after consuming a bottle and a half of Cristal, and he admitted it. He said he was going to leave her and marry the Salisbury concubine."
"EMILY: What did she do?"
"LADY 1: She threw an ice sculpture at his head."
"EMILY: I can't believe I missed that."
"LADY 1: You've missed everything lately."
"LADY 3: Yes, where have you been? Is everything all right?"
"EMILY: Yes, it's just, uh, Richard."
"NATTIE: He hasn't been hanging out in Salisbury, has he?"
"EMILY: No, he's been swamped at work. Night and day, weekends. You'd think he was the only person who worked at that company. Plus, he hasn't been feeling very well. His back and knees. Very bad knees. [Sees Rory at the patio doorway] Oh Rory, what a nice surprise."
"RORY: Hey Grandma. Sorry to butt in like this."
"EMILY: Nonsense, come and meet my friends. Ladies, I'd like you to meet my granddaughter Rory."
"LADY 3: Well, hello Rory."
"RORY: Nice to meet you."
"NATTIE: My goodness, what a pretty girl you are."
"LADY 1: She looks just like Lorelai, doesn't she?"
"NATTIE: The eyes."
"LADY 3: The nose."
"LADY 1: Walk around sweetie."
"EMILY: Sally, leave the girl alone."
"LADY 1: I just wanna see the walk. Lorelai had such a specific walk."
"LADY 3: Fast."
"LADY 1: That was it."
"EMILY: Come, sit, would you like some tea?"
"RORY: Oh, no. I just came to pick up a book that Grandpa was supposed to leave for me."
"EMILY: Go check his study. It might be on his desk."
"RORY: Okay, thanks. [walks inside]"
"LADY 3: Emily, your granddaughter is just lovely. How old is she?"
"EMILY: Sixteen."
"LADY 3: Sixteen, that's a nice age."
"LADY 1: So, have you thought about her debut?"
"EMILY: Oh, uh, no, not yet."
"LADY 3: Well you know, the Daughters of the Daughters of the American Revolution Debutante Ball is next week."
"EMILY: It is? I hadn't realized."
"LADY 3: Why don't you present Rory there?"
"EMILY: Oh. . uh. . Well, I don't know. Isn't it a little late?"
"LADY 1: Oh please. For Emily Gilmore, I'm sure they'll bend the rules."
"LADY 3: Oh you have to. With a girl like that Emily, you'll be the hit of the ball."
"NATTIE: She'd definitely be the prettiest one there."
"LADY 1: Except for Katie Heathington."
"LADY 3: No, didn't you hear? Katie fell off her horse, has a scab on her face."
"NATTIE: Oh, well then, if Katie Heathington has a scab on her face, Rory will definitely be the prettiest one there."
"LADY 3: It'll be your crowning moment."
"[Rory returns with the book]"
"RORY: I found it. [pause] Yay."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table doing homework as Rory comes home.]"
"RORY: I'm coming out."
"LORELAI: Out of what?"
"RORY: Out into society."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: I went to Grandma's house after school."
"LORELAI: Okay, right away, bad."
"RORY: And, um, her DAR friends are all there and they're talking about this debutante ball that's being thrown."
"LORELAI: Oh no."
"RORY: And when I got back from Grandpa's office, they all invited me out onto the patio."
"LORELAI: No no no, please tell me you did not go out onto the patio."
"RORY: I went out onto the patio."
"LORELAI: Ugh, Rory, that's like accepting the position as the drummer in Spinal Tap."
"RORY: Before I knew it, Grandma was telling me how important it is for a person to be properly presented to society."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"RORY: And how every young girl dreams of this day."
"LORELAI: Agh."
"RORY: And how there are flowers."
"LORELAI: Oh Lord."
"RORY: And music."
"LORELAI: Please."
"RORY: And cake."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, the cake's actually good."
"RORY: And before I knew it, Grandma was bringing out your old dress and I was trying it on and. . . what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm getting you out of this. [picks up phone]"
"RORY: Mom, wait."
"LORELAI: I swear, there is nothing in the world my mother is better at than getting someone to agree to something that in any other universe, they would never ever consider."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I am still convinced she had something to do with Lily Tomlin doing that movie with John Travolta."
"RORY: I'm doing this."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because you should've seen the look on Grandma's face when she asked me. It's just really really important to her."
"LORELAI: But. . ."
"RORY: Now if it's that important to her, and it's not that important to me, then why shouldn't I do it?"
"LORELAI: Rory, do you now what a coming out party says?"
"RORY: It says I'm a woman now."
"LORELAI: No. It says, 'Hi, I'm Rory. I'm of good breeding and marriageable age, and I will now parade around in front of young men of similarly good breeding and marriageable age so they can all take a good long look at me.'"
"RORY: You're exaggerating."
"LORELAI: No, it's like animals being up for bid at the county fair, except sheep don't wear hoop skirts."
"RORY: Look, I promised, but you don't have to be apart of it if you don't want to."
"LORELAI: No, no, if you wanna do it, I'll help. It's just weird. This is all the stuff I ran away from. I just assumed you'd be running with me."
"RORY: Well, I would, but I heard debutantes don't run. Something about the heels."
"LORELAI: All right then. If you're sure, where do we start? Uh, let's see. Well, you have a dress. You need a dowry, I guess. There you go. And uh, you'll need shoes, hose, gloves, some mice, a dog, a pumpkin. What's wrong?"
"RORY: Oh, nothing."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Oh, no, it just says that your father is supposed to present you at the ceremony."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: Whatever, it's no big deal. I can get someone else to do it. Grandpa probably."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Or Taylor."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Or the cable guy looked pretty friendly last week. Maybe he has a tux."
"LORELAI: Hand me the phone."
"RORY: I was kidding about the cable guy. What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: [dials phone] Look missy, there are plenty of things that should weird you out about coming out, but inviting your father shouldn't be one of them."
"OPERATOR: The number you have dialed. . ."
"LORELAI: Umm, wra. . . gum wrapper."
"RORY: He's not going to come."
"LORELAI: You don't know until you ask."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: [dials new number] Look, we call, we ask, there's no harm. Trust me. Cable guy's not going anywhere."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, hi. Where the hell are you?"
"CHRISTOPER: Boston."
"LORELAI: Boston? [walks into living room]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, Boston. Baked Beans, cream pie, tea party, strangler."
"LORELAI: Oh, that Boston."
"CHRISTOPHER: And you?"
"LORELAI: Me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where are you?"
"LORELAI: Helsinki."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I finally got the girl band together and after a week opening stateside, we headed across the Atlantic and now we're huge with the Nordic set."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's good to hear from you. We haven't talked in awhile."
"LORELAI: You could've called too, you know. Or do you have one of those special phones that only receives calls?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I figured you had a lot going on what with the engagement and the canceling of the engagement. How's that going, by the way?"
"LORELAI: No, still canceled."
"CHRISTOPHER: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Good. And I'm even better when I'm not talking about it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Moving on then."
"LORELAI: So I have some shocking news. Rory's coming out."
"CHRISTOPHER: Out of what?"
"LORELAI: Coming out. White dresses, gloves, curtsies."
"CHRISTOPHER: Stop it."
"LORELAI: I swear to God."
"CHRISTOPHER: I can't believe you're letting her do it."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I wasn't about to let her use my method of getting out of it."
"CHRISTOPHER: This is crazy."
"LORELAI: She's doing it as a favor to my mom, there's no talking her out of it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, did you tell her about Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke, Gloria Vanderbilt?"
"LORELAI: Yes, and she's perfectly willing to marry Cary Grant, get offed by her crazy butler and start designing blue jeans as soon as the ball ends."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, okay, if that's what she wants."
"LORELAI: Now comes the reason for my phone call."
"CHRISTOPHER: All your regular 976 numbers are busy."
"LORELAI: Now I know this is totally not your thing, but as you will remember, part of the whole coming out process involves the girls being escorted around the dance floor by their Dads."
"CHRISTOPHER: Ah."
"LORELAI: Now, I know you would rather sit through ""Endless Love"" than ever be apart of this scene again. But this is very important to your daughter and she has never asked you for anything, and although no one's keeping track, it would seem that your constant non-presence in her life and your lack of ever showing up when you say you're going to or calling when you say you're going to or basically doing anything when you say you're going to would tend to indicate that you owe her, big time. Now before you say no, I want you to take a minute and remember you have a great daughter who needs you and she has a mother who will hunt you down like a half-priced Kate Spade purse if you disappoint her."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I'm there."
"LORELAI: By there, do you mean the Daughters of the American Revolution Annual Debutante Ball?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh Chris, please don't make this promise if you can't."
"CHRISTOPHER: I wouldn't miss it."
"LORELAI: It's next weekend."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'll clear my schedule."
"LORELAI: You swear?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh wait, next weekend?"
"LORELAI: Christopher!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm kidding, I will definitely be there."
"LORELAI: Okay, and in exchange for that I will refrain from saying the ten things that came to mind for making fun of your schedule."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thanks."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"CHRISTOPHER: Bye."
"[Rory walks into living room]"
"LORELAI: Hey Little Debbie, your dad is definitely gonna be there."
"RORY: You're kidding!"
"LORELAI: No, he's gonna walk you down the stairs, and turn you in a circle, watch you curtsy, and announce that Rory Gilmore is officially open for business."
"RORY: I can't believe it. And he definitely said definitely?"
"LORELAI: Definitely."
"RORY: So there's a fifty/fifty chance."
"LORELAI: I don't know. He sounded pretty sure, I'd say sixty/forty."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Dean, Lane and Rory are on the couch watching TV while Lorelai walks around the living room talking on the telephone.]"
"LORELAI: No Mom, I'm sure one crinolin will be plenty. No, she doesn't. I'm sure she doesn't. Yeah, in what scenario would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves, Mom? Oh, I'm sorry, I meant what scenario on my planet would I have bought Rory elbow length kidskin gloves?"
"RORY: So?"
"DEAN: So what?"
"RORY: It's good huh?"
"DEAN: It's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction."
"RORY: And doesn't Neil Young look cool?"
"DEAN: I guess."
"RORY: If you'll notice, he's wearing a tux."
"DEAN: Neil Young looks cool because he's Neil Young, not because he's wearing a tux."
"LORELAI: No, I don't have to ask her mom 'cause I know the answer. I know the answer Mom, I know the answer. Yeah, no, okay, well I don't have to ask her MomHold on. Rory, would you like Grandma's hairstylist to come and set your hair before the ball? . . Oh, I did not coach her Mom, go back to talking about gloves."
"RORY: I think you're gonna look great in a tux."
"LANE: Tails."
"DEAN: What?"
"LANE: Yeah, according to this it says that all escorts must be properly attired in black tails, white cumberbuns, and white gloves."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: I'm sure the gloves are optional."
"LANE: Not according to this."
"DEAN: Tails? Gloves?"
"RORY: Remember Neil Young. Remember that you love me. Remember that I'll be watching BattleBots with you for a month."
"DEAN: Show me Neil Young again."
"[Horn honks from outside]"
"RORY: Dad!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Christopher is getting out of his car as Rory and Lorelai walk out the front door.]"
"RORY: Dad! [runs to the car]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Whoa! Hold it right there. A lady never runs out to meet a gentleman caller who hasn't been announced."
"RORY: Sorry, we haven't tamed my wild ways yet."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thank God I'm here now."
"RORY: I missed you! [hugs him]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Me too."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey."
"LORELAI: What is this?"
"CHRISTOPHER: What? Oh my God, where did this come from?"
"LORELAI: What happened to your bike?"
"CHRISTOPHER: A crazy game of key exchange at the car wash."
"LORELAI: This is a car."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes it is."
"LORELAI: It has four wheels and a roof and airbags and seat belts and my God, it smells like a forest."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I needed a little more space. Had something big to haul. I believe this belongs to you. [hands Rory a box from the trunk]"
"RORY: The Compact Oxford English Dictionary!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I promised you I'd get it. I'm just sorry it took so long."
"RORY: That's okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: On the bright side, this is the new edition. If I'd gotten you the old one, you wouldn't have the word 'jiggy' in it."
"RORY: Thank you. I love it, I'm gonna go look things up right now."
"CHRISTOPHER: Wait wait. [hands her magnifying glass]"
"RORY: Thanks."
"CHRISTOPHER: Go. [Rory goes inside]"
"LORELAI: That was really great of you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. So back to mocking my car?"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. A Volvo sedan, are you kidding?"
"CHRISTOPHER: This is a great car."
"LORELAI: For driving to bingo."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, it just seemed like time. I couldn't keep showing up for work on my bike."
"LORELAI: Work?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You've heard of it."
"LORELAI: Yes, but I didn't think you had."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, it took awhile. I kept getting it mixed up with nap, but I finally figured it out."
"LORELAI: So, you bought a car and got a job?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Actually, job then car."
"LORELAI: Oh, 'cause it's more responsible that way."
"CHRISTOPHER: Exactly."
"LORELAI: Wow, so tell me about the job."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I show up everyday, drink bad coffee, exchange lame pleasantries in the break room with Linda from marketing, and then at the end of two weeks they give me a paycheck. It's a pretty cool system."
"LORELAI: You're serious?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, you know how us working types are. Get in."
"LORELAI: Well uh. . .I'm not supposed to take rides with strangers."
"CHRISTOPHER: Trust me."
"LORELAI: Yes, but only if you promise we won't go over 25 miles an hour on the motorway. [Lorelai gets in as Christopher blasts some music] Oh my God, George Lucas wishes he had this sound system."
"CHRISTOPHER: I've got Alpine head units, two subs, and two twelves. In exchange, no passenger-side airbag."
"LORELAI: Ah, so the old Christopher still lives."
"[Rory leans in the car window.]"
"RORY: Could you please attenuate the cacophony out here?"
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"[Rory reaches in and adjusts the volume]"
"RORY: Turn down the music. [goes back inside]"
"LORELAI: Next time instead of a dictionary, just slip her a crisp twenty."
"CHRISTOPHER: Deal."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Emily walk through the front door carrying several shopping bags.]"
"LORELAI: Twelve pairs of pantyhose."
"EMILY: It's going to be a long night. She's bound to have a run."
"LORELAI: Twelve pairs."
"EMILY: There's the presentation, the circle, the curtsy, the fan dance."
"LORELAI: Mom, there'd have to be a 12k run and a jujitsu demonstration for her to go through twelve pairs of pantyhose."
"EMILY: Does it really hurt to be prepared, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: No, Mom, it doesn't hurt to be prepared."
"EMILY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: And the good news is, now she is prepared for her high school graduation, her college graduation, her marriage, three to five anniversaries, a hostess gig, and jury duty, especially if she's sequestered."
"EMILY: You make me tired."
"[Richard walks down the stairs.]"
"EMILY: Oh Richard, I didn't know you were home."
"RICHARD: Yes, well, we learn something everyday."
"EMILY: You didn't have to work?"
"RICHARD: I am working."
"LORELAI: Hey Dad, guess how many pairs of pantyhose we bought today?"
"RICHARD: I'd rather not, if you don't mind."
"EMILY: Oh Richard, I got you some beautiful new cufflinks for this weekend."
"RICHARD: I already have cufflinks."
"EMILY: I know, but these have bulldogs on them. Come look."
"RICHARD: I'll look at them later."
"EMILY: All right, fine. Just remember to pick up your tux from the cleaners tomorrow."
"RICHARD: I won't have time."
"EMILY: It's right around the corner from your office."
"RICHARD: I have to go in early tomorrow."
"EMILY: Well, go now."
"RICHARD: I am busy now."
"EMILY: Doing what?"
"RICHARD: Emily, I am not going to qualify my time with you. I am not going to pick up my tuxedo. You planned this ridiculous affair, you pick up my tuxedo. Or I simply don't have to go. Either one of these options is fine with me. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Hey Mom, I might be reading too much into this, but um, is something going on between you and Dad?"
"EMILY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, he just seems a little less jolly than usual."
"EMILY: He's just busy."
"LORELAI: He seems upset."
"EMILY: Well, he's not."
"LORELAI: You seem upset."
"EMILY: Well I'm not. We're both fine."
"LORELAI: Okay, my mistake."
"EMILY: I better go pick up his tux."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO"
"[Rory and Dean are practicing dancing.]"
"MISS PATTY: Now, keep counting in your heads. Look each other in the eye. Dean, are you leading?"
"DEAN: I have no idea."
"MISS PATTY: Okay okay, stop stop stop. Now remember, one of the most important things in ballroom dancing is to remember to spot, otherwise you're gonna get dizzy. So, what you wanna do is you wanna pick out something to focus on. I usually like to find a lonely seaman. Then when turning, whip your head around and find your spot again. [spins around] Hello sailor, hello sailor, hello sailor. Now you try it."
"DEAN: You've gotta be kidding me."
"RORY: I think you can do it without the 'hello sailor' part."
"DEAN: Rory."
"RORY: BattleBots."
"DEAN: For the rest of your life."
"MISS PATTY: Now take it from the top."
"[Rory and Dean start dancing again as Lorelai and Christopher walk in with coffee.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you guys are really improving. Now you're actually facing each other."
"CHRISTOPHER: Anyone need a break?"
"MISS PATTY: Okay, take five, but don't sit down because your muscles will get cold."
"LORELAI: So how's it going?"
"RORY: Actually, I'm not very good."
"DEAN: Yeah, which is really holding me back because I'm a natural."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe you just need a glittery glove and a really freaky face."
"RORY: At one point Miss Patty thought Dean was gonna get hurt, she made me sit in the corner and watch."
"LORELAI: Hey! Nobody puts Baby in the corner."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's not your fault. Ballroom dancing is a wonderfully sexist thing. Any woman can do it, all she needs is a strong male lead. No offense Dean. [He pulls Lorelai towards him, but she stumbles.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, agh!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, well, most any woman can do it."
"LORELAI: I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready. I want a do over."
"CHRISTOPHER: Fine. May I have this dance?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Do you have a trust fund? Always make sure."
"[Lorelai and Christopher start dancing. When they're done, Rory and Dean clap.]"
"RORY: Okay, I'm adopted."
"DEAN: Yeah, I'm never gonna be able to do that."
"CHRISTOPHER: No, you guys just need some practice."
"MISS PATTY: Listen to your father, Rory. Your adorable, adorable father."
"LORELAI: Come on, let's get you out of here before you become Patty's next husband."
"CHRISTOPHER: See you guys later. Bye Patty."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, the way you toy with me."
""
""
""
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Christopher walk out of the dance studio each holding a coffee cup.]"
"LORELAI: Did you know you still knew how to do that?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I wish I didn't. Imagine what we could do if we freed up the brain space that holds onto the Vianese Waltz."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's right up there in between old Brady Bunch reruns and the lyrics to Rapture."
"CHRISTOPHER: Ooh, I gotta say, this isn't like the chai lattes in Boston."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, expecting Luke to make a chai anything was completely insane."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm pretty sure he just threw a cinnamon stick in some tea."
"LORELAI: I'm pretty sure it's not a cinnamon stick."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, throwing this out now."
"LORELAI: So chai latte, when did that happen?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I don't know. Everyone at work drinks them."
"LORELAI: Huh. Well, since you still haven't told me what exactly it is that you do, I'm gonna go with yoga instructor or chiropractor."
"CHRISTOPHER: No, it's actually pretty interesting. I'm working for this firm that helps those overblown tech companies scale back and stay afloat now that they're facing leaner times."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, uh, what's the interesting part?"
"CHRISTOPHER: We dress like superheroes when we do it."
"LORELAI: Oh, nice. So how long do you think you'll be able to keep this going?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm pretty happy there. I'd say at least 'til Tuesday."
"LORELAI: Oh, so long term."
"CHRISTOPHER: You know, it's weird. I always hated the idea of having to be somewhere at a specific time day after day, but as it turns out, I like the stability."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. I like that at the end of the day, I feel like I've done something. I've earned something."
"LORELAI: Well, I think that's really great."
"CHRISTOPHER: Only took me ten years and several failed business ventures to figure out what I wanted."
"LORELAI: Which is?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Not my parents' life."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"CHRISTOPHER: Something you figured out at sixteen."
"LORELAI: Actually, six months, but I just couldn't vocalize it yet."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, you knew what you wanted, you went out and got it. I was always a little jealous of you."
"LORELAI: Well, you seem to be catching up. We did good."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Well, I did good. The fact that she can't follow a lead is all you."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory sits on the couch painting her toenails, Christopher helps Dean tie his bowtie, Lorelai walks around with a book on her head eating Chinese food.]"
"LORELAI: See now, only a lady can gracefully walk around a room with a book on her head while eating Kung Pao chicken. And a great lady can even spit the peanuts back into the container without anyone noticing."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, don't be intimidated. You have to practice and practice to get to my level."
"RORY: Anyone want the last eggroll?"
"DEAN: Uh, no."
"LORELAI: Heh. Where are you going?"
"RORY: To get the eggroll."
"LORELAI: You're getting the eggroll yourself?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: No! Ladies never get their own eggrolls. Ladies never get their own anything. They don't even get their own ideas."
"RORY: Oh boy."
"LORELAI: They just sit helplessly and wait for some young strong man to come by and assist them. They don't step in puddles, they don't step over puddles. They can't even look at puddles. They actually need to be blindfolded and thrown in a sack and carried over puddles."
"RORY: Isn't there a moratorium on how long ladies are supposed to talk?"
"LORELAI: Uhh, no. Now repeat after me, I am completely helpless."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so you pull the left side through the back loop and tug a little bit on both sides, and you my friend, might just be mistaken for a gentleman. Or a waiter."
"DEAN: So, how do you know how to do this?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Seventeen cotillions, a dozen debutante balls, and a brief but scarring experiment with the Children of the American Revolution."
"LORELAI: Where you wore nothing but the bowtie."
"CHRISTOPHER: A good idea on conception, but the sudden snowstorm instantly dampened the effect."
"DEAN: Hey, uh, do you think it's cool when Neil Young wears a tux?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, of course, but it's Neil Young."
"DEAN: All right. I should get going. I'll see you at three."
"RORY: Okay. Oh wait. [hands him a box]"
"DEAN: What's this?"
"RORY: Your gloves."
"DEAN: I thought you were kidding."
"LORELAI: No no. Ladies never kid."
"DEAN: Bye. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: I think I'm going to bed too."
"LORELAI: Do you need help?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Wrong! The correct answer is yes. Ladies need help with everything."
"RORY: Goodnight."
"LORELAI: [sighs]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Night."
"RORY: Night."
"LORELAI: I don't know about that girl. I don't know how she's ever gonna make it in society. At this rate, she's gonna actually get a job and only marry once."
"CHRISTOPHER: You calling your mom again?"
"LORELAI: I don't get it. For the last week, every five minutes she's calling me checking on shoe fittings and curtsy progress, and have I talked Rory into putting her hair up yet, and then tonight, nothing."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm sure they had a lot of getting ready to do for themselves tonight."
"LORELAI: She's been acting so weird lately. They're fighting. Openly fighting. I don't think they've ever done that before. I'm not sure what to do about it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Move to California. That's what I do when my parents fight."
"LORELAI: You know, my father doesn't even want to go tomorrow. His perfect angle granddaughter is being presented to society in front of all his friends and colleagues, something he never got to do with his bad, loser, evil daughter."
"CHRISTOPHER: Maybe you should talk to them. I'm sorry, was that me that said that? I must've had an aneurysm."
"LORELAI: Well, nothing more I can do tonight. I'm gonna head up to bed. Do you want me to turn off the lights?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to stay up and do a little work tonight."
"[Lorelai laughs]"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. I keep forgetting that's not a joke anymore."
"CHRISTOPHER: Goodnight."
"CUT TO BALLROOM"
"[Lorelai and Rory arrive at the ballroom.]"
"RORY: Wow, this place is huge. Do I have to walk down those stairs?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm afraid so. Unless you wanna make a really memorable entrance and just sliiide down the banister. Which I totally encourage, by the way."
"LADY: You are"
"RORY: Lorelai Gilmore."
"LADY: Late."
"LORELAI: Sorry, my fault. Took me awhile to get pretty. Not all of us are sixteen anymore, you know what I mean? No."
"LADY: You are to head up the stairs. The preparation room is on the right."
"LORELAI: Look for the toxic cloud of Chanel and Final Net."
"[Rory starts walking towards the stairs. She looks back at Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: [mouths] Sliiide."
"CUT TO PREPARATION ROOM"
"[Rory and the lady enter the room. Other girls are walking around getting dressed and doing their makeup.]"
"LADY: Hang your dress there, put your makeup on over there. You'll have to make do with a non-lighted mirror. The lighted ones went to the girls that were here before dawn. Listen up ladies, everyone must be beautiful and ready to go by 7:30."
"[Rory sits down at a mirror. She talks to the girl next to her.]"
"RORY: I can't believe we have an hour and a half."
"LIBBY: I know, I am never gonna be ready in time. God only knows if the swelling on my nose is gonna go down. I had to go and inherit my father's nose. I'm Libby."
"RORY: Rory."
"LIBBY: Uh, which one should I wear? I've thought about this all month, and I cannot decide."
"RORY: Oh, well, that's a tough one."
"LIBBY: I know. This is red red, and this is orange red. The wrong one and I will end up looking like a hooker. Or a teacher."
"RORY: That's a lot of pressure."
"LIBBY: The two minutes you are standing on those stairs tonight will determine the social status for the rest of your life."
"RORY: Wow, what if you trip? I mean, not that you would. You wouldn't. I might. Probably will actually. Could be a real Cirque du Soleil kind of night."
"LIBBY: You should not even joke about stuff like that. Ow. There's a head under there, you know."
"CUT TO BALLROOM"
"[The bartender hands Lorelai a drink.]"
"LORELAI: You are a wonderful, wonderful man. I have a feeling we're going to be very close tonight. [sees Emily] Hmm. Mom, you're here."
"EMILY: Where should I be, Spain?"
"LORELAI: Oh. I tried calling you all night last night."
"EMILY: I was very busy."
"LORELAI: And then we got here before you."
"EMILY: What is your point, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. It's just weird."
"EMILY: Well, I'm here now, so it's not weird anymore. Look at these flowers. Baby's breath. What is this, County General?"
"LORELAI: You look very nice Mom. I like your dress."
"EMILY: Cotton tablecloths, folding chairs. It's not supposed to be like this. In my day, people sat in real chairs."
"LORELAI: Mom, what's the matter?"
"EMILY: I wanted my granddaughter to be presented to society in a beautiful elegant ballroom, not a Shakey's."
"LORELAI: The room is beautiful Mom. You're being too critical."
"EMILY: There's Nan. I'm going to have a little talk with her about the proper height for a taper."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"CUT TO PREPARATION ROOM"
"[Rory is sitting down reading when Libby walks over to her holding a flask.]"
"LIBBY: Midori sour?"
"RORY: Oh, no thanks."
"LIBBY: More for me. At my last coming out, I shared with this girl who couldn't handle her booze. Neon green puke all over her white dress."
"RORY: Your last coming out?"
"LIBBY: Oh, this is my fifth one this year."
"RORY: Wow."
"LIBBY: You know, they say four out of five debs marry their escorts."
"RORY: Kind of like the dentists with Trident."
"LIBBY: Well I figure, five coming out balls, five escorts, one of them has to stick, right?"
"RORY: Good logic."
"LIBBY: So, is your escort the one?"
"RORY: The one what?"
"LIBBY: The one you're gonna marry."
"RORY: Oh, well"
"LIBBY: Is he cute?"
"RORY: Yes, he is very cute but"
"LIBBY: Where are you guys planning to live when you get married?"
"RORY: Okay, hold on a second."
"[Another girl walks over]"
"LIBBY: Katie, hi. Too bad about your face."
"KATIE: Is it horrible?"
"LIBBY: No, you can hardly tell. Just walk sideways."
"CUT TO BALLROOM"
"[Lorelai is standing with some women.]"
"LADY 1: These things will be the death of me."
"LADY 2: Oh I know. And we've had no time to prep. Janet just got out of Rainbow Hills two days ago."
"LORELAI: Rehab?"
"LADY 1: Fat farm."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"[Christopher walks up to Lorelai]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hi, sorry to interrupt. Could you come with me? My cumberbun and I aren't seeing eye to eye."
"LORELAI: Men, totally helpless. Excuse me."
"[They walk away from the women]"
"LORELAI: You saved me. I love you. I wanna have your baby. Oops, too late."
"CHRISTOPHER: I saw the look. Same one you had that time you ended up on homecoming court."
"LORELAI: Ugh, someone's idea of a sick, sick joke. Hey, by the way, Neil Young's got nothing on you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"[Emily walks over to them]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, have you seen your father?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"EMILY: He promised me he'd be here by now."
"LORELAI: Wait, you didn't come together?"
"EMILY: I swear, if he misses this"
"LORELAI: Well, Mom, did you call him?"
"EMILY: Yes I called him. Of course I called him. I wouldn't go this long without calling him."
"CHRISTOPHER: Emily, he's here."
"EMILY: Where? [he points to him] Oh. [walks to Richard] Richard, where have you been?"
"RICHARD: Where have I been?"
"EMILY: Yes, where have you been?"
"RICHARD: I'm here, aren't I?"
"LORELAI: I can't look. Did she b*at him with the baby's breath?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No, they're just energetically practicing their sign language."
"LORELAI: Oh God."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I think this is a really good time for a martini. Hello. Thirsty people here. [Lorelai goes behind the bar] Ah, what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Steve won't mind."
"CHRISTOPHER: Little tip. Never a good idea to let people know you're on a first name basis with the bartender. Wow, this is really something."
"LORELAI: What?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You and I together at a debutante ball."
"LORELAI: Huh, yeah."
"CHRISTOPHER: Just like it would've been sixteen years ago."
"LORELAI: Fancy dress."
"CHRISTOPHER: Sneaking booze."
"LORELAI: Parents acting crazy."
"CHRISTOPHER: You look great."
"LORELAI: I'm so glad you're here."
"CHRISTOPHER: So am I."
"ANNOUNCER: All fathers please report to the debutante staging area upstairs. Fathers to the staging area."
"CHRISTOPHER: Showtime. You gonna be all right?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'll see you later."
"LORELAI: Curtsy pretty."
"CUT TO STAGING AREA"
"[Rory's waiting in line. Dean walks up to her.]"
"DEAN: Hey. I just wanted to see you before you became a proper lady of society."
"RORY: So what do you think?"
"DEAN: I think you look like a cotton ball."
"RORY: Why, thank you Jeeves."
"DEAN: But a really cute cotton ball."
"[Libby walks up to Rory.]"
"LIBBY: Oh my God, is this your escort?"
"RORY: Yeah, it is."
"LIBBY: You are totally getting married. [walks away]"
"DEAN: What did she say?"
"RORY: Oh, well...[sees Christopher] Dad, great, let's go."
"DEAN: I'll, uh, I'll meet you downstairs. Good luck. [leaves]"
"RORY: Okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: Last chance to shimmy down the drainpipe."
"RORY: Do me a favor?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Anything."
"RORY: Just don't let me fall."
"CHRISTOPHER: Right back at ya."
"CUT TO BALLROOM [The ball begins as a lady addresses the audience from a podium on the staircase. Lorelai sits at a table; Emily and Richard stand near the bar.]"
"LADY AT PODIUM: Good evening. On behalf of the Daughters of the American Revolution, I would like to welcome you to our annual debutante ball. Oh this brings back so many memories. I myself came out in this very hall in nineteenwell, let's just say, a number of years ago. Now the word debutante comes from the French word debuter, which means to lead off. . .[fades into background]"
"EMILY: Just come sit down."
"RICHARD: I am going to finish my drink."
"EMILY: You won't be happy until you've spoiled this entire evening, will you?"
"LORELAI: Um, guys, hi, there's a lady up there with a rock the size of Neptune around her neck talking about the debutantes of ancient Greece. It's a lot easier to fall asleep if you're sitting down, trust me."
"RICHARD: I will sit down when I'm ready to sit down."
"EMILY: Richard, lower your voice."
"RICHARD: No, I will not lower my voice. I paid a fortune to be here, and I will speak just as loudly as I like."
"EMILY: You're embarrassing us. You're embarrassing Rory."
"RICHARD: Embarrassing Rory? This wasn't Rory's idea. This was your idea. This whole ridiculous evening was your idea, Emily."
"EMILY: You don't want your granddaughter presented to society?"
"RICHARD: To hell with society. [people look at him] Yes, I'm talking about you!"
"LORELAI: Come on, that's it."
"[Lorelai leads them into another room]"
"LORELAI: Are you two completely out of your mind? There is a ceremony going on in there. Young girls in ugly dresses and stupid fans are parading around in circles for God knows what reason, and you two are ruining it."
"RICHARD: I didn't want to come here. You knew I didn't want to come here."
"EMILY: Well, that's too bad. We have a social responsibility Richard."
"RICHARD: I am so tired of hearing you say that."
"EMILY: People expect us to be certain places and do certain things and we can't just withdraw from all of that."
"RICHARD: Do you know what I'm going through at work?"
"EMILY: Your whole life isn't that damn company, Richard."
"RICHARD: I have told you what I'm going through, but somehow, you just don't seem to hear it. You don't listen to me. You don't listen to anybody."
"EMILY: That is not true."
"RICHARD: It is true. Isn't it true? Has she ever listened to a word you've said?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, hey, people listen in different ways, right? I mean, some people listen with their ears, and some people listen with not their ears, but that doesn't mean some actual listening hasn't happened in some form."
"EMILY: I have listened to you Richard. I know exactly what is going on with you."
"RICHARD: Really, what?"
"EMILY: You lost an account."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: No, I didn't lose an account. I was taken off an account. I was taken off an account that I personally brought into this company ten years ago."
"EMILY: There are other accounts, Richard."
"RICHARD: I have been in charge of that account for ten years!"
"EMILY: How can you be so angry? Yes, they took you off that account, but they also gave you a promotion."
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily."
"EMILY: You said they moved you upstairs to a larger office and gave you a new title and a better parking space."
"RICHARD: Emily, dammit, I am being phased out."
"EMILY: You are not."
"RICHARD: What do you mean I'm not? I know whether I'm being phased out. I invented phased out for this company. Don't you think I did the exact same thing to Alan Parker?"
"EMILY: Alan Parker retired."
"RICHARD: Alan Parker was phased out. I now have his office, I now have his parking space. Do you know what happens from here? I lose more accounts, slowly but surely. They will put a younger man on them with me to be trained by the best. And then, one day they'll call and ask me to let that young man take a meeting without me, just to see how fast he's learning, and then suddenly that young man is given that account. And this happens again and again and again until I'm nothing, but a symbolic figurehead that they roll out for banquets and group pictures. And then one day, Emily, I will be asked to leave."
"EMILY: Well, so what?"
"RICHARD: Excuse me."
"LORELAI: Dad, I don't think Mom meant exactly"
"EMILY: So what if that's true?"
"LORELAI: Or maybe she did."
"EMILY: There are other options."
"RICHARD: I don't want other options. I want to get up every morning and put on my suit, and go to my office, and do my work, like I've done everyday for the past thirty years. That's what I want to do. That's the only thing I want to do."
"[Rory leans into the hallway.]"
"RORY: Um, excuse me, hi, sorry to interrupt, but I'm next."
"[They walk back into the ballroom]"
"LADY AT PODIUM: Elizabeth Dotie, daughter of George Edward Dotie the fourth, and Elenor Dotie. [pause] Lorelai Gilmore, daughter of Christopher Hayden and Lorelai Gilmore."
"[Christopher and Rory walk down the stairs as Dean waits at the bottom. Christopher kisses Rory's hand, Rory curtsies, Christopher walks away, Dean walks Rory down the aisle.]"
"EMILY: That should've been you up there. Nothing's turning out the way it was supposed to. [walks away]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Later that night, Lorelai, Christopher, Rory, and Dean walk down the sidewalk.]"
"RORY: So did you know that you're considered a hot Dad?"
"LORELAI: Hah!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Really?"
"RORY: Libby said that it's too bad you're my real Dad because if you were my stepdad, I could steal you away from mom."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"CHRISTOPHER: That Libby's got a good life ahead of her."
"LORELAI: Well, I was very proud of all of you. You made it through the entire ceremony with a completely straight face. Almost all of you."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry, but that fan dance was more than I could take."
"LORELAI: Hey, I need a burger."
"RORY: Me too. Dean?"
"DEAN: Honestly, the only thing I can think of is taking off this tux."
"LORELAI: Hey, watch it, you're talking to a lady now."
"DEAN: Well, how about if I do it at home?"
"LORELAI: Better."
"RORY: Thanks again for going with me."
"DEAN: Tomorrow you start paying. Bye. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Bye. And then there were three."
"CHRISTOPHER: Actually, I have to get back to Boston first thing in the morning so I'm gonna call it a night too."
"RORY: What? Not even time for fries?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'll tell you what. I'll get up a little early and have coffee with you before I go. Deal?"
"RORY: Deal."
"LORELAI: Honey, go ahead and order for us. I'll be there in a sec."
"RORY: Okay. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to tell you how amazing you were tonight. Really, you completely came through for her."
"CHRISTOPHER: She deserves it."
"LORELAI: I haven't always given you a lot of credit in the past, but I'm giving you credit now. Big credit. Major credit. Buy yourself a sofa."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thanks. I will."
"LORELAI: You know, um, I happened to be looking through some old maps this afternoon and I couldn't help but notice that Boston is not that far away."
"CHRISTOPHER: Aw, you needed a map to tell you that?"
"LORELAI: I also noticed that that, um, I-84 is a very good road. Solid, paved."
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: And I put this information in my pretty little head, I was thinking, if you wanted to maybe drop by occasionally, it wouldn't be too difficult."
"CHRISTOPHER: You realize I'll be driving the Volvo?"
"LORELAI: Actually, I'm coming around to the Vovlo."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. I think it's sort of a Catholic schoolgirl thing, you know? It's conservative on the outside, bad on the inside."
"CHRISTOPHER: I like that image."
"LORELAI: I've also heard the I-84 can get jammed on the weekends."
"CHRISTOPHER: It can."
"LORELAI: So if you wanted to stay a little longer, just to avoid the traffic, it might be a good idea. I mean, Rory would definitely love it, and I wouldn't mind either. CHRISTOPHER: That is a tempting offer, but I really have to get back."
"LORELAI: To work?"
"CHRISTOPHER: To workand to someone."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"CHRISTOPHER: I know I should've told you."
"LORELAI: Oh no, that's fine. That's totally your business."
"CHRISTOPHER: No, I meant to, butLor, it's just that you and I are so connected and..."
"LORELAI: Chris, please, I get it. I think it's really great, I really do."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thank you."
"LORELAI: So who is it? Ooh, let me guess. Linda from marketing got to you, didn't she?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Her name is Sherri."
"LORELAI: Sherri from marketing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sherri from Boston."
"LORELAI: Ah, hence the move."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Is it serious?"
"CHRISTOPHER: It's getting there."
"LORELAI: Seeing you in just a bowtie serious?"
"CHRISTOPHER: We're living together."
"LORELAI: Wow, you really have changed."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well, Sherri made it pretty clear that I was gonna lose her if I didn't start getting it together, so..."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well if you find a girl who's good with dating a square in a Volvo, you do what it takes to keep her."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, uh, so I'll. . .I'll see you back home."
"LORELAI: Yes you will."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory is about to bite into her burger as Lorelai walks in.]"
"LORELAI: [gasps] Hey!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: After all you've been through tonight and I come in here and find you eating like that."
"[Rory raises her pinkie]"
"LORELAI: There you go."
"RORY: Being a lady is hard."
"LORELAI: So tonight, what's the consensus?"
"RORY: The fan dance was humiliating, I'm never doing a curtsy again, but having Dad around was great."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it was."
"RORY: He's got a new girlfriend, you know."
"LORELAI: Sherri."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Poor girl's named after a Journey song, that's gotta be rough."
"RORY: He seems happy."
"LORELAI: He does. He really does."
"RORY: I'm glad."
"LORELAI: Me too."
"RORY: I feel kind of bad for Grandma though. She was so into this night and then she ended up being so miserable."
"LORELAI: Don't worry. She'll have more fun at the next one."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we have you signed up for the next six balls."
"RORY: Not funny."
"LORELAI: Hey, you're doing this until you bring home a prize."
"RORY: Ignoring you now."
"[Luke brings Lorelai her burger.]"
"LUKE: So, back from the ball huh?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I left behind a glass slipper and a business card in case the prince is really dumb."
"LUKE: Good and desperate thinking."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Hmm, Luke."
"LUKE: What?"
"[Lorelai nods towards Jess, who is wiping down the counter dressed like Luke, complete with flannel shirt and backwards baseball cap. Luke walks over to him.]"
"LUKE: What do you think you're doing?"
"JESS: Working."
"LUKE: So you think this is funny, huh?"
"JESS: I'm sorry. I thought this was the uniform."
"LUKE: Okay, you know what, that's fine. Have your little joke, you know. It doesn't bother me at all. You just go over there and clean off that table, okay? I'm ignoring you. You do not exist."
"JESS: Okay."
"LUKE: That's it, get upstairs and change."
"JESS: Whatever you say Uncle Luke."
"LUKE: It's Luke, just Luke. Mister Luke. In fact, don't address me at all."
"LORELAI: You know, I'm really lucky."
"RORY: Yeah, why?"
"LORELAI: I have someone to complain to when life sucks or work sucks or just everything sucks. I have someone I can talk to."
"RORY: Yeah, who?"
"LORELAI: Oh Shecky, you k*ll me. It just must be really lonely not to have that."
"RORY: Are you thinking about Grandma?"
"LORELAI: I'm just. . .thinking."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily is gardening on the back patio as Lorelai walks out the back door.]"
"LORELAI: Hey Mom."
"EMILY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Oh, nothing much. I had a little time before my business class and I thought, 'Hey, why don't I just go over to Mom's house and just hang.'"
"EMILY: Just what?"
"LORELAI: Just hang, you know. Hang out. Talk, don't talk, whatever. Just hang."
"EMILY: Oh."
"LORELAI: So you're gardening, huh?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, don't let me stop you. I'll just sit here and just hang."
"EMILY: Are you sure you don't need something?"
"LORELAI: Nope. I'm just here to hang."
"EMILY: Hang. Well."
"LORELAI: You know Mom, if there's ever anything you want to talk about with me, you can."
"EMILY: All right."
"LORELAI: Okay. So"

"OPEN AT LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in and sit at a table.]"
"LORELAI: Wow, busy today. Has Luke been advertising or something?"
"RORY: He gets good word-of-mouth."
"LORELAI: Well, we have to start spreading bad word-of-mouth so we can always have a table."
"RORY: Well, that would be wrong, but sure. Vermin?"
"LORELAI: Or no potable water."
"RORY: Or no potable vermin."
"LORELAI: That would scare them away."
"RORY: Or confuse them away."
"[Lorelai sees Luke talking with one of the customers.]"
"LORELAI: It's so weird to see him talking like that."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: Just all friendly. He's usually only good for a quick couple of gruff monosyllables, and then he's off."
"RORY: He is the master of the monosyllable."
"LORELAI: He never flirts with any of the women, do you notice that?"
"RORY: He's flirted with you numerous times."
"LORELAI: Don't start."
"RORY: Hey, flirt with him now, we need coffee."
"LORELAI: Oh Luke, we're just dying for some refreshments."
"LUKE: Keep your pants on."
"LORELAI: Hmm. He can turn it off and turn it on so fast."
"RORY: Hey, I found a CD under the front seat of our car. Did you lose one?"
"LORELAI: Not that I know of, but I'm kind of sloppy with them."
"RORY: So, you didn't hide it?"
"LORELAI: Why would I hide a CD?"
"RORY: I don't know. Bay City Rollers?"
"LORELAI: It's not a Bay City Rollers CD."
"RORY: How do you know?"
"LORELAI: Because I know what's not hidden under that seat."
"RORY: Ha! Because you know that Barry Manilow is under that seat."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"LUKE: Where's Barry Manilow?"
"RORY: Under Mom's seat."
"LORELAI: All right, I confess, I was hiding Barry Manilow."
"RORY: You confess!"
"LORELAI: But he was very big when I was very small and it's the live version where he does a medley of all the commercial jingles he's written."
"RORY: Don't worry. Everyone's allowed a guilty pleasure now and again."
"LORELAI: Hm, very diplomatic from the girl who had the Bryan Adams poster above her bed for two years."
"RORY: Fink."
"LORELAI: Do you have a guilty pleasure Luke?"
"LUKE: Nah."
"LORELAI: Are you into music?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: Monosyllabic man strikes again."
"RORY: We'll have two muffins please."
"LUKE: You got it. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Do you think he's dated anyone since Rachel?"
"RORY: I don't know. Where would he meet anyone? He's either here or in his apartment."
"LORELAI: Maybe he has a secret life. Maybe he's got a little chippy stowed away in Mount Pilot."
"RORY: Well, we'll know eventually."
"LORELAI: I say he's a bachelor for life."
"RORY: I say there's someone for everyone. [starts laughing]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Uhh, Barry Manilow."
"LORELAI: Ugh, stop."
"RORY: [sings] Looks like we made it"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah? Spice Girls."
"RORY: Duran Duran."
"LORELAI: Dido."
"RORY: Olivia Newton John."
"LORELAI: The Macarena. You and Lane for hours and hours, for weeks on end."
"RORY: Hey, we were mocking. You can't mock the mocking."
"LORELAI: All right. It's getting ugly. Let's stop."
"RORY: Let's be friends again."
"LORELAI: All right."
"RORY: [giggles]"
"LORELAI: Stop it."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is in the kitchen, Lorelai walks in.]"
"LORELAI: Agh."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: The car won't start."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It's just dead. I turned the key and it makes a horrible sound."
"RORY: What kind of sound?"
"LORELAI: Like rrrar, rrrar, rrrar. You know, but less feminine."
"RORY: That's the battery."
"LORELAI: Well, what did I ever do to make the battery mad?"
"RORY: Let's see. You've kept the radio on all night, k*ll the battery. You've kept the lights on all night, k*ll the battery. You've kept the door open, which keeps the ceiling light on, all night, k*ll the battery."
"LORELAI: Okay, well then I've done multiple things to make the battery mad."
"RORY: You gonna walk?"
"LORELAI: I'm wearing heels."
"RORY: Change your shoes."
"LORELAI: I'd have to change my outfit."
"RORY: Change your outfit."
"LORELAI: I'd have to walk upstairs."
"RORY: Suddenly I'm living with Zsa Zsa Gabor."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna call Michel."
"RORY: This thing is too small."
"MICHEL: Independence Inn."
"LORELAI: Hold on Michel. That backpack is not too small."
"RORY: It's miniscule."
"LORELAI: Just take your schoolbooks and leave some of the other books."
"RORY: I need all of my other books."
"LORELAI: You don't need all of these."
"RORY: I think I do."
"LORELAI: Edna St. Vincent Milay?"
"RORY: That's my bus book."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. What's the Faulkner?"
"RORY: My other bus book."
"LORELAI: So just take one bus book."
"RORY: No, the Milay is a biography, and sometimes if I'm on the bus and I pull out a biography and I think to myself, 'Well, I don't really feel like reading about a person's life right now' then I'll switch to the novel, and then sometimes if I'm not into the novel, I'll switch back."
"LORELAI: Hmm. Still there Michel?"
"RORY: Yes, I. . ."
"LORELAI: Hold on. What is the Gore Vidal?"
"RORY: Oh, that's my lunch book."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. So lose the Vidal or the Faulkner. You don't need two novels."
"RORY: Vidal's essays."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. But the Eudora Welty's not essays or a biography."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: So it's another novel, lose it!"
"RORY: Unh uh. It's short stories."
"LORELAI: Ugh. This is a sickness. Michel."
"RORY: I am growing very old."
"LORELAI: Come pick me up?"
"MICHEL: I am already here."
"LORELAI: Put Carol on the desk and come pick me up."
"MICHEL: I am not speaking to Carol. She ate my low-fat cheese."
"LORELAI: Michel, come pick me up and I will buy you some cheese."
"MICHEL: Low-fat cheese."
"LORELAI: Low-fat cheese."
"MICHEL: Low-fat American cheese."
"LORELAI: Low-fat American cheese."
"MICHEL: And a meringue cookie."
"LORELAI: Just get over here."
"MICHEL: Fine."
"RORY: Ha! I made it all fit. Edna, Bill, Gore and Eudora, all safe and sound."
"LORELAI: Cool. That's your French book."
"RORY: Hmm? Oh, I know. I'm carrying my French book."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm. You so thought that French book was already in there."
"RORY: I did not."
"LORELAI: You have a problem."
"RORY: No I don't."
"LORELAI: You're gonna tip over from the weight of that backpack."
"RORY: No I'm not."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna have to buy you a forklift. Bye."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Rory walks in carrying her lunch tray. She sits down at a table, puts on her walkman, and starts reading a book. A woman suddenly taps her on the shoulder.]"
"MRS. VERDINAS: I startled you. I didn't mean to."
"RORY: That's okay. I'm easily startled."
"MRS. VERDINAS: I'm Mrs. Verdinas, the guidance counselor. Your name's Rory, isn't it? Rory Gilmore?"
"RORY: Yes. Hello."
"MRS. VERDINAS: Hello. I'd love to sit and talk to you. Can we do that?"
"RORY: Sure. Anytime."
"MRS. VERDINAS: How about after you finish your lunch?"
"RORY: Oh, that soon?"
"MRS. VERDINAS: I think soon would be good."
"RORY: Okay, what's this about?"
"MRS. VERDINAS: We'll talk about it then."
"RORY: Not even a hint?"
"MRS. VERDINAS: See you in a little bit."
"RORY: Right. Right."
"CUT TO MRS. VERDINAS' OFFICE"
"[Mrs. Verdinas is sitting at her desk; Rory knocks at the door.]"
"MRS. VERDINAS: Come in. Hello Rory, have a seat."
"RORY: Thank you."
"MRS. VERDINAS: So don't worry about being late for your next class. I'll write you a note if you are."
"RORY: Okay."
"MRS. VERDINAS: I know from your record you're a stickler for punctuality."
"RORY: I am a stickler, yes. I only slipped one time last year. I hit a deer. Actually, he hit me. Or she did. Or not me, my car. But, um, then he or she ran away, and I think it turned out okay. I didn't see it again, so I can't definitively say but I did look for him or her. It's a big story for me, I'm surprised I don't tell it better."
"MRS. VERDINAS: Why don't we get to the reason I asked you here?"
"RORY: Okay."
"MRS. VERDINAS: Headmaster Charleston brought you to my attention a few weeks ago. He's worried, and after observing you a bit, I'm worried too."
"RORY: You've been observing me?"
"MRS. VERDINAS: We've been concerned about your social behavior here at school."
"RORY: What about it?"
"MRS. VERDINAS: You don't seem to interact much with the other students."
"RORY: I do sometimes. In class, all the time."
"MRS. VERDINAS: But rarely outside of class. At lunch, you're always by yourself."
"RORY: That's when I catch up on my reading."
"MRS. VERDINAS: And that walkman, it makes you very unapproachable."
"RORY: You approached me."
"MRS. VERDINAS: And you almost jumped out of your skin. What does that tell you?"
"RORY: That I'm jumpy. On the Fourth of July, forget it, I'm a wreck. And when the Stars Hollow orchestra begins to play in the gazebo, the guy banging the cymbals, I'm. . .it drives me nuts."
"MRS. VERDINAS: Denying a problem doesn't solve a problem, Rory. Unless something changes, this could affect your future."
"RORY: But I don't understand. I get good grades, isn't that enough?"
"MRS. VERDINAS: You know, it's not. Rory, when we make recommendations to universities on behalf of a student, that student's social k*ll are a big part of it. Now, I assume you want to go to a university?"
"RORY: Absolutely."
"MRS. VERDINAS: Well, universities do not look kindly on loners."
"RORY: But I'm not a loner."
"MRS. VERDINAS: Really? Well, what do you think a loner is?"
"RORY: Loners are those guys that you see walking around wearing, I don't know, out of date clothing, bell bottoms, and they tend to carry a duffel bag with God knows what inside. That's a loner."
"MRS. VERDINAS: Loners come in all different shapes and sizes, even pretty girls. Just try to improve Rory. Mix it up with others. You may even enjoy it. Start with lunch."
"RORY: I don't suppose there's a lunchtime reading/walkman-listening club I can join, is there? I guess that's no."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory sit on the porch as Kirk fixes Lorelai's Jeep.]"
"LORELAI: So what does she expect you to do?"
"RORY: She said mix it up."
"LORELAI: Mix it up, what does that mean?"
"RORY: I guess that means going up to strange kids at school and saying, 'Hey, mind if I awkwardly butt in where I don't belong and don't want to be?'"
"LORELAI: The whole thing's ridiculous. Chilton is a cult."
"KIRK: Lorelai, do you know what this is? [holds up a bundle of wires]"
"LORELAI: Um, no."
"KIRK: Damn."
"RORY: I don't know. Maybe there is something wrong with me."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't say that."
"RORY: Maybe I am a loner. I mean, you were mocking my backpack today. I might just be one step away from carrying a mysterious duffel bag."
"LORELAI: Oh no, no you don't. Don't you go doubting who you are or how you should be. How dare that woman do this to you!"
"RORY: It wasn't just her. The whole meeting was Charleston's suggestion."
"LORELAI: Well, good. It's time I called on old Schnickelfritz Charleston to tell him to stop messing with my kid's mind."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No, I'm sorry. I don't like this. Schools like Chilton try to stamp out every vestige of individuality and I'm not gonna let that happen."
"KIRK: It's all fixed. I found a loose terminal. I reconnected the battery and jumped it, so it's set to go."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks Kirk."
"KIRK: And I'm not gonna charge you for the time I spent stuck underneath the car."
"LORELAI: That's great Kirk."
"KIRK: And I just want you to know that I overheard, and you're absolutely right. I carried a duffel bag and ate lunch by myself my entire school career, and I turned out just fine. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: I'm still going down there."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[The secretary walks Lorelai into the Headmaster's office.]"
"SECRETARY: Ms. Gilmore is here. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Hello Mr. Charleston."
"HEADMASTER: Ms. Gilmore, so good to see you."
"LORELAI: It's good to be here."
"HEADMASTER: You know, I checked my records to remind myself why I asked you in only to discover that you had actually called for this meeting."
"LORELAI: Yes I did."
"HEADMASTER: I'm surprised. We don't see you often. We'd forgotten what you'd looked like."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm pretty much the same. Rosy cheeks, strong of bone, sly of wit."
"HEADMASTER: How nice. So why did you want to see me?"
"LORELAI: Well, I wanted to talk to you about Rory and uh, this ridiculous accusation about her being a loner and how that's somehow something bad."
"HEADMASTER: Well, it is bad."
"LORELAI: No, it's not bad, it's just her. I raised Rory to do what she wants as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. And I don't see how her reading a book or listening to a walkman is hurting anyone."
"HEADMASTER: It's hurting her."
"LORELAI: I respectfully disagree."
"HEADMASTER: That doesn't surprise me, based on my research."
"LORELAI: What research?"
"HEADMASTER: When I saw your name on the appointment list, I decided to have a look at the file."
"LORELAI: Ah yes, Rory's file's been of a lot of interest to you guys lately, hasn't it?"
"HEADMASTER: I wasn't talking about Rory's file. I was talking about yours."
"LORELAI: I have a file?"
"HEADMASTER: You most certainly do."
"LORELAI: It's tiny."
"HEADMASTER: It's very thin."
"LORELAI: Well that's good, right? It means I haven't gotten into a lot of trouble."
"HEADMASTER: On the contrary, a thin file for a parent indicates lack of participation."
"LORELAI: Oh, now wait a minute. I've participated in stuff."
"HEADMASTER: You attended the bake sale."
"LORELAI: And I sold stuff."
"HEADMASTER: Then promptly left."
"LORELAI: I was busy."
"HEADMASTER: Without fraternizing with the other Chilton parents at all."
"LORELAI: Busy, busy, busy like a really tall bee."
"HEADMASTER: Like mother, like daughter."
"LORELAI: Okay, hold on."
"HEADMASTER: Ms. Gilmore, active participation in Chilton activities for a parent is vitally important."
"LORELAI: But"
"HEADMASTER: This is a list of organizations sponsored by Chilton. Parent groups dedicated to certain specific tasks."
"LORELAI: Uh, my"
"HEADMASTER: Any one of them would be honored by your participation."
"LORELAI: Okay, my schedule is"
"HEADMASTER: We're all tremendously busy, Ms. Gilmore. I hope you're not too busy to do what's best for you or what's best for Rory, are you?"
"LORELAI: No."
"HEADMASTER: Excellent. Let us know what it will be."
"LORELAI: I will. [stands up to leave] Oh, may I go?"
"HEADMASTER: Yes, you may."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"HEADMASTER: I'm glad you came in today. It was a good idea."
"LORELAI: Yes. I'm just full of good ideas."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai sits at the table going through papers as Rory comes home.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Yeah, look Fat Albert. Get me a soda, will you?"
"RORY: Mom, what are you doing here? You were supposed to meet me in my Latin class after meeting with Headmaster Charleston."
"LORELAI: Oh my God. I was. I totally forgot. Ugh, I'm so sorry."
"RORY: Mom, come on, what happened. Did you talk to him?"
"LORELAI: I did. I told him that he was completely out of line with this treatment of you, that you are not a loner freak, you have plenty of friends, and you don't own a long black leather Matrix coat, and they should fall down on their kneesocks everyday that you deign to show up at that loser school."
"RORY: And?"
"LORELAI: And then he yelled at me."
"RORY: He what?"
"LORELAI: He pulled out a file and told me I was a bad Chilton mom."
"RORY: He did not."
"LORELAI: And that I don't participate in school activities."
"RORY: Well, you work."
"LORELAI: And I don't make posters."
"RORY: You have no artistic capabilities."
"LORELAI: And I don't chaperone school dances."
"RORY: Does he know that you got pregnant at sixteen?"
"LORELAI: Basically I'm not doing my part to help further your educational future."
"RORY: So we both got busted."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: Now I have to pick a group or a cause or sponsor a club or something."
"RORY: This sucks."
"LORELAI: But hey, I've been thinking. I mean, the whole reason we did this Chilton thing is for you to get into Harvard, right?"
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: And these fanatics that run your school, they're the ones that write the letters to the fancy colleges saying things like, 'Hey she's keen, look at her' or 'Have you seen the L tattooed on her forehead, 'cause it sure is a big one.'"
"RORY: So you're saying we should just go along with this?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, go along with it. Talk to some kids, I'll hang out with their moms, and we'll get into Harvard, take over the world, then buy Chilton and turn it into a rave club. What do you say, deal?"
"RORY: Deal."
"LORELAI: Oh, look, the Chilton Cheer Society wear matching hats. Eh? Go Harvard."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Rory walks in with her tray and is about to sit down at a table by herself, but then walks over to another table.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"FRANCIE: Hey."
"RORY: There's a bad draft over there where I usually sit. It's kind of like a big downward gust. It's not exactly 'Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore', but it's still pretty darn uncomfortable, especially when you're just gotten your hair to behave. So can I sit here?"
"FRANCIE: Uhh, yeah."
"RORY: Thanks. [sits down] Nice table. It's much more level than the one over there."
"FRANCIE: Your name is Lori."
"RORY: Rory."
"FRANCIE: Right, Rory."
"RORY: What's yours?"
"IVY: Francie."
"RORY: You're Francie?"
"IVY: No, she's Francie, I'm Ivy."
"RORY: Francie's spokesman."
"FRANCIE: Well, I am a very important person, and everyone knows very important people never speak for themselves."
"RORY: I did not know that, but I do now."
"FRANCIE: That's Dijur, Lily, Seline, Lana, Asia, Anna, and Lem."
"RORY: Lem."
"LEM: Short for Lemon."
"RORY: Oh sure."
"FRANCIE: We were just discussing homecoming. Thoughts?"
"RORY: Great movie. Oh wait, that was Coming Home. Sorry."
"FRANCIE: I truly believe the whole homecoming dance ritual's be put to sleep."
"IVY: Or at least assigned a new color scheme."
"[Paris walks by with her lunch tray, walks back to stare at Rory for a moment, then walks away.]"
"FRANCIE: Hmm. Rory, huh? Do they call you Ror?"
"RORY: Not unless provoked."
"IVY: No nickname?"
"RORY: Actually, Rory is a nickname. My full name is Lorelai."
"LEM: Lorelai. That's a weird name."
"RORY: Well, Lem, what can I say?"
"FRANCIE: Sounds southern. Are you a belle?"
"[bell rings]"
"RORY: Uh, no, but apparently I command them."
"FRANCIE: Well, see you later your highness."
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Rory walks out of the cafeteria and runs into Paris.]"
"RORY: God! You're like a pop up book from hell."
"PARIS: You were sitting with the Puffs. How did you do it?"
"RORY: The who?"
"PARIS: The Puffs, the Chilton Puffs. You were at their table and I wanna know how."
"RORY: I don't know, I just sat down."
"PARIS: Nobody just sits down with them, you have to be invited."
"RORY: Paris, it's not the cosa nostra."
"PARIS: No, they're the Puffs, the most influential sorority at Chilton."
"RORY: Chilton has sororities?"
"PARIS: Only ten worth mentioning, and the Puffs, they have been number one for at least the last fifty years. My mother was a Puff, my aunt was a Puff."
"RORY: I thought only colleges had sororities."
"PARIS: And the connection you make with the Puffs, they last the rest of your life. My cousin Maddie got her internship at the Supreme Court because of Sandra Day O'Connor."
"RORY: Sandra Day O'Connor was a Puff?"
"PARIS: Yes. She was puffed in 1946, became the president in '47, and in '48 she actually moved the group to the very table you sat at today."
"RORY: God."
"PARIS: It was quite a controversial move at the time, but she was just that powerful."
"RORY: I had no idea."
"PARIS: What did you say about me?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Did you tell them you hated me?"
"RORY: I didn't mention you."
"PARIS: Because I have been k*ll myself trying to get invited in. I spent all of last year sucking up to Francine Jarvis."
"RORY: You mean Francie?"
"PARIS: You call her Francie?"
"RORY: Oh, no, someone else did."
"PARIS: I have helped her with her homework, secured her a prime spot in the parking lot, organized her locker, scrunched up the plastic strands on her pom-poms to make them fluffy. I have done everything except give her a manicure, and by God, if I had any talent with an orange stick, I would've done that too."
"RORY: I know I'm not the first one to say it to you, but you're insane."
"PARIS: Okay, look, I know you and me, we. . ."
"RORY: Shouldn't be around each other armed."
"PARIS: Yes. But you have to understand. I have to get into that group, I just have to. My family's name and reputation, not to mention my entire future, all depend on me getting into that group."
"RORY: It's just a clique, that's all."
"PARIS: Look, all I'm asking is please don't say anything horrible about me. Don't tell them that you hate me."
"RORY: Paris, come on, I'm not in their group. They don't care what I say."
"PARIS: They let you sit at their table all the way through lunch, you're in."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: You know what, never mind. Do what you want, I don't care."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory get out of the car and walk to the front door.]"
"LORELAI: Who the hell names their kid Lemon?"
"RORY: Someone really into citrus."
"LORELAI: Ugh, crazy crazy people."
"RORY: It's just so weird that the one table I sit down at is home to the secret society."
"LORELAI: I know. It's like waking up one day and realizing that everyone else in your family can pull their face off."
"RORY: Yes, it's exactly like that."
"[The maid opens the door]"
"MAID: Your mother would like you to head out to the patio. We're barbecuing tonight."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"[they walk inside and head towards the patio]"
"RORY: Does Grandma have a barbecue?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Maybe she keeps it in the secret room with the paper napkins and the mismatched sheets. Wow, she really is barbecuing."
"[they walk out onto the patio, where a chef is cooking on the grill]"
"RORY: Hey, cool!"
"LORELAI: What's up, Poppin' Fresh?"
"RORY: Ooh, corn!"
"LORELAI: Nice!"
"[They each take a corn on the cob from the pile]"
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[they start eating the corn]"
"RORY: Mm."
"LORELAI: Mmm."
"[Emily walks out onto the patio]"
"EMILY: What is this, a refugee camp? Come inside and eat at the table."
"LORELAI: Mom, the whole point of barbecuing is to eat outside."
"EMILY: Animals eat outside. Human beings eat inside with napkins and utensils. If you want to eat outside, go hunt down a gazelle. Make your decision, I'll be inside. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: What are the odds of finding a gazelle around here?"
"RORY: Slim to none."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's go."
"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[Emily is sitting at the table as Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"EMILY: I'm extremely disappointed in you Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hold on Mom. [takes off her coat, sits down at the table, puts her napkin on her lap.] Okay, go ahead."
"EMILY: I had lunch with Bitty Charleston today and she told me what happened with you and the headmaster."
"LORELAI: What? Geez, does that woman do nothing all day but hide under his desk with a tape recorder?"
"EMILY: After all we've gone through to get Rory in that school, and then you humiliate all of us by not being involved. That is just incomprehensible."
"LORELAI: Hey, she wasn't involved either."
"RORY: Wow, just sitting here."
"EMILY: You are a grown up, you have to set an example. If she's not involved with school, then she learned it from you."
"RORY: Yeah."
"EMILY: How hard is it to help out just once in awhile? Join a group, attend a meeting, and all for the sake of"
"LORELAI: Mom, stop already, please. I have joined a group, okay?"
"EMILY: You have?"
"RORY: You have?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: Which one?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna join the Booster Club, mmkay? The Booster Club, I'm going to boost."
"EMILY: Well, the Boosters are a very fine organization."
"LORELAI: That's why I picked 'em."
"EMILY: They do very good work for the school."
"LORELAI: All went into the picking process."
"EMILY: And the matching sweatshirts they wear are just darling."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[At the Booster Club Meeting, five women are sitting at a table in the cafeteria.]"
"AVA: Well, we're certainly not doing it like last year."
"GINGER: God, was that awful!"
"MENA: It wasn't that bad."
"AVA: Wasn't that bad? Mena, by the time we got finished paying for everybody's stomach to be pumped, there was no money left to buy the new bleachers."
"MENA: But the salsa band was wonderful."
"GINGER: This is giving me a migraine. I just"
"AUBREY: I vote we take a break."
"[Lorelai walks into the room.]"
"LORELAI: Hi. Sorry to interrupt."
"AVA: It's all right. Can we help you?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yes, actually. . . this isn't the Booster Club, is it?"
"AVA: Yes it is."
"LORELAI: Oh, thank God you're not wearing the sweatshirts."
"AVA: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Uh, you know what, never mind. I'm Lorelai Gilmore, sorry I'm late."
"AVA: Oh please, you haven't missed a thing. So far, we've had coffee, debated Carolyn Masters' nose job"
"MENA: Too pug."
"AUBREY: Too smushed."
"GINGER: Who cares?"
"AVA: And we started arguing about our fall fundraiser."
"AUBREY: I suggested we take a break."
"AVA: I ignored the suggestion, and now here we are. You're all up to date. Have a seat."
"MENA: Lorelai Gilmore. So you're Emily's daughter?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. You know my mother?"
"MENA: Oh, very well. We're on the philharmonic committee together. She told me to keep an eye out for you."
"LORELAI: Huh, that's nice."
"MENA: She wasn't sure you'd show up."
"LORELAI: So, uh, fall fundrasier, what do we do?"
"AVA: Well, last year we had the usual luncheon with silent auction and a salsa band."
"MENA: A terrific salsa band."
"AVA: But every guest ended up in the hospital with food poisoning before the auction even started, and we wound up losing money."
"LORELAI: Whoops."
"AVA: Yes, it's quite a whoops, isn't it? Anyhow, this year we decided to do a fashion show."
"LORELAI: Oh, that sounds fun."
"AVA: Yes, well, Aubrey here works at Saks."
"AUBREY: Uh, used to work at Saks."
"AVA: Oh, sorry. Used to work at Saks, and she got several designers to donate their clothes, so now we're just trying to find a suitable caterer and location and someone to plan the event."
"GINGER: Oh, it's all going very well."
"MENA: I still say we approach Chateau Mimsy."
"AVA: That space is too small, Mena."
"AUBREY: How about something more young and fun? You know, my stepdaughter Kimberly..."
"AVA: Sarah."
"AUBREY: Right, Sarah. Sarah. Anyhow, she told me about this new club called The Digs[fades into background]"
"MENA: [whispers to Lorelai] She's been married a month and still can't remember the names of her stepchildren."
"AUBREY: so the booths are like in these pits, and then there's sand everywhere"
"GINGER: Stop her."
"AVA: I don't think that's exactly what we're looking for."
"LORELAI: Um, I run an inn."
"AVA: You do?"
"MENA: Which one?"
"LORELAI: The Independence Inn, it's in Stars Hollow."
"AVA: Oh, I've been there. It's lovely."
"LORELAI: And we have a terrific chef who's never once hospitalized an entire function. And, well, I mean, I don't know exactly what you're looking for, but we do functions there all the time."
"AVA: Who's your function coordinator?"
"LORELAI: I am, actually. And since it's for charity, I could get you a really good price."
"AVA: I'm sorry, I forgot to ask you, are you from heaven?"
"LORELAI: You like the idea?"
"AVA: I love the idea. I love it so much, we can finally take that break Aubrey's been dying for."
"[Everyone stands up and walks away. Ava walks over to Lorelai.]"
"AVA: Well, this is very exciting."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"AVA: Would you mind if I come out there tomorrow to take a look at the place? You know, make sure it's big enough for the runway."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, sure, I'll be there all day. So, a fashion show, huh? Are we gonna get any famous models?"
"AVA: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: You know, to model the clothes. Any chance I'm finally gonna get to see Kate Moss eat something?"
"AVA: Oh, no no. We're the models."
"LORELAI: We? Who's we?"
"AVA: We, the women in this room. Me, you, we."
"LORELAI: Me?"
"AVA: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh well"
"AVA: By the way, welcome to the Boosters. We're thrilled to have you. [hugs Lorelai]"

"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: Ha ha, yours is worse than mine."
"LORELAI: Ugh, they totally just snuck that modeling thing in."
"RORY: Hmm, my mom's a model. Maybe you'll get to date Leonardo DiCaprio now."
"LORELAI: Plus, now I have to plan the whole stupid thing."
"RORY: Lorelai Gilmore. Nope, doesn't sound model-y enough. You need something that stands out more. How about Waffle? We could call you Waffle and say you're from Belgium?"
"LORELAI: [dials her cell phone] Okay, I'm crabby. I need to do something about it. [on phone] Hey Mom."
"EMILY: Well, hello."
"LORELAI: So I went to my first Booster meeting last night, did Bitty tell you?"
"EMILY: No, she did not."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, maybe she's still stuck under that desk. You might want to send someone out there to look."
"EMILY: Well, it's certainly nice to hear you finally getting involved."
"LORELAI: Yes, in fact we're planning a charity fashion show next weekend, and I volunteered to organize it."
"EMILY: Well, good for you."
"LORELAI: Yes, and since I know how concerned you are about how Rory's perceived at Chilton, I knew you'd want to be involved somehow, so you're gonna be one of the models."
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, so it's next Saturday, be there at four, and we'll provide hair and makeup."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you can't be serious."
"LORELAI: Oh, and we'll need your measurements also."
"EMILY: This is ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Mom. You said you wanted me to be involved. Well, I'm involved, now don't you want to do your part to ensure Rory's future?"
"EMILY: All right."
"LORELAI: Start measuring. [hangs up]"
"RORY: You feel better now?"
"LORELAI: Waffle's very happy."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Rory starts to sit alone at her regular table when Francie walks over to her.]"
"FRANCIE: Sit with us, please. [walks away]"
"RORY: Um, okay."
"[Francie sits down at her table.]"
"FRANCIE: Here she comes."
"[Rory walks up the Puffs' table]"
"LEM: Welcome."
"FRANCIE: We talked. We find you fascinating."
"IVY: Like the monkey habitat."
"FRANCIE: So we've decided to extend an invite to you. You can eat here anytime you like."
"RORY: Wow, that's nice of you, thanks. So can I ask about this whole sorority thing?"
"FRANCIE: Pardon?"
"IVY: Sorori-what?"
"RORY: I thought you guys were"
"LEM: We have no idea what you're talking about."
"FRANCIE: That's right. After all, what's the point of a secret society if it's not a secret?"
"RORY: The whole school apparently knows about it."
"[Paris leans against the wall behind their table and reads.]"
"FRANCIE: Well, no one has proof. It's just folklore."
"IVY: Like Snow White and Rose Red."
"FRANCIE: Or Mariah Carey's crackup."
"LEM: Have you heard her fan message recently? She's fine and is currently staring at a really beautiful rainbow."
"IVY: Survivor, hello."
"[Francie sees Paris standing behind them]"
"FRANCIE: Friend of yours?"
"RORY: Paris? Oh well"
"IVY: Too intense."
"LEM: Way too intense."
"FRANCIE: She comes from a long line of us though."
"IVY: I hate nepotism."
"LEM: It, however, does make the world go round."
"RORY: You know, Paris, while, yes, a little intense, is also very smart."
"FRANCIE: So I drop a box of matches on the floor, she can tell me how many there are?"
"RORY: She's editor of the paper. Amazing writer, plus funny."
"IVY: She's funny?"
"RORY: Oh yeah. Hilarious. I mean, the times that we have spent laughing together. I tell ya, she's a regular Gary Muledeer."
"FRANCIE: She asked you to talk her up, didn't she?"
"RORY: No, not at all."
"IVY: Right."
"RORY: No, really. I think she's actually thinking of joining another non-existent group."
"FRANCIE: What?"
"IVY: But her family's fully puffed."
"RORY: I don't know. Maybe I heard her wrong, but I think that's what I heard her say."
"FRANCIE: A voluntary defector."
"IVY: Francie."
"FRANCIE: I know. [turns to Paris] Paris?"
"PARIS: Yeah?"
"FRANCIE: I think the wall can hold itself up just fine, don't you?"
"PARIS: What?"
"FRANCIE: You should sit."
"PARIS: Sit?"
"FRANCIE: Here."
"PARIS: Sit there?"
"IVY: Or here."
"LEM: Or anywhere for that matter."
"PARIS: Well"
"RORY: Unless you've got somewhere else to be. Another table, perhaps."
"PARIS: Another table?"
"FRANCIE: No, you have to sit, right here. Come, come. [moves down to make room for Paris]"
"PARIS: Uh, okay. I guess I can sit, for a little while anyhow. [sits down]"
"FRANCIE: Okay, so, have we discussed homecoming yet?"
"IVY: Not to my knowledge."
"FRANCIE: I truly believe the whole homecoming dance ritual's be put to sleep."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[The day of the fashion show, Lorelai walks through the lobby over to Michel at the front desk.]"
"LORELAI: Uh, in the dining room, and don't drip water on the floor please. Michel, did the"
"MICHEL: Five minutes ago."
"LORELAI: What about the"
"MICHEL: He brought the wrong color, I sent him back."
"LORELAI: What? When will he be"
"MICHEL: Twenty minutes tops, or I told him I will hunt him down and shave his beard."
"LORELAI: Good, now we need the uh"
"MICHEL: Oh, yes, thank you for reminding me."
"LORELAI: Anything"
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I'm going in the dining room. Come and get me if you actually need me to finish a sentence for you."
"MICHEL: Will do."
"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[Lorelai walks in and goes over to the man fixing the runway.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, how's it coming?"
"MAN: Working on it."
"LORELAI: This cannot tilt."
"MAN: I know this."
"LORELAI: Women in heels will be walking on it. Make it not tilt."
"[Sookie walks out of the kitchen]"
"SOOKIE: The lettuce is dry."
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"SOOKIE: How attached are you to salad?"
"LORELAI: It's free to see anyone it wants."
"SOOKIE: I don't want to make a salad with dry lettuce."
"LORELAI: What's the alternative?"
"SOOKIE: I can make soup."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"SOOKIE: Okay, great."
"LORELAI: Ah, Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Did we pay for the lettuce already?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, we did."
"LORELAI: See if you can put it in the soup."
"SOOKIE: Gotcha."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Luke walks in carrying his toolbox.]"
"LORELAI: Ah, thank God! You brought Bert."
"LUKE: Right here."
"LORELAI: My men, follow me."
"LUKE: By the way, you do tell people that you're the one that named my toolbox, right?"
"LORELAI: Toolbox, dirty."
"LUKE: Oh geez."
"[they walk to the man fixing the runway.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, um, move."
"MAN: What?"
"LORELAI: I want Luke to look at it."
"MAN: Hey, I put this thing together."
"LORELAI: Yes, and I loved your work in Pisa, now get out of the way, please."
"[the man walks away]"
"LUKE: Okay, so what seems to be the problem?"
"LORELAI: Uh ha! The problem is. . .that's not funny."
"LUKE: I like it when you're stressed. Oh man, he put this thing up all wrong."
"LORELAI: Can you fix it?"
"LUKE: I don't know, I'll see."
"LORELAI: You can fix it."
"LUKE: You can say it all you want, it doesn't make it true."
"LORELAI: You can fix it."
"LUKE: Not with you hovering, I can't."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm leaving. You can fix it. [walks away and sees Ava] Oh, Ava, hi."
"AVA: God, the place looks wonderful."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Let me show you to the room where we're all getting ready."
"AVA: All right."
"[As they walk towards the changing room, they pass Luke]"
"LORELAI: Fix it yet?"
"LUKE: The moron used the wrong supports."
"LORELAI: Please tell me you can fix it."
"LUKE: If I told you I couldn't fix it, would you accept that?"
"LORELAI: No."
"LUKE: I can fix it."
"LORELAI: Thank you. So we're right back here[Ava stops to stare at Luke] Uh, Ava, the room's right back here."
"AVA: Him."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"AVA: There, man with tools, who is that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's Luke."
"AVA: Luke, I like Luke."
"LORELAI: What?"
"AVA: Oh, he's adorable. And he looks strong, is he strong?"
"LORELAI: Oh I don't know. I don't think he's gonna be in a sideshow anytime soon, but he can get the lid off a pickle jar."
"AVA: Is he single?"
"LORELAI: Well, uh yeah, he is single."
"AVA: What kind of women does he like?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, ones with heads. You know, I don't really know what Luke's taste in women is."
"[Emily walks into the dining room]"
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, um, Ava, why don't you go on in the back, go to the right, you'll find the dressing room, I'll be there in a sec. [Ava leaves] Hi Mom."
"EMILY: The place isn't nearly done yet."
"LORELAI: Ugh. Mom, why don't you just go on in the back and get ready."
"EMILY: Did you see the clothes? What am I wearing?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I just had them hang them up in the room"
"EMILY: God, I hope they're not tasteless or zebra striped or spandex."
"LORELAI: Well, one good way to find out is to go on back and take a peak."
"EMILY: You have to get ready too."
"LORELAI: I'll be there in a sec."
"EMILY: If I'm doing this, you're doing this. I mean it."
"[Emily walks in the back, Lorelai walks over to Luke.]"
"LORELAI: Oh! You fixed it!"
"LUKE: Yup, for the time being, but I'm gonna stick around for awhile just to make sure nothing happens."
"LORELAI: Oh. Okay."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You don't want me to stick around?"
"LORELAI: I didn't say that."
"LUKE: Is there a reason I shouldn't stick around?"
"LORELAI: Are you listening? It's fine."
"LUKE: Because I'm just doing this for you. I mean, if this thing goes and someone breaks their neck"
"LORELAI: Luke, stick around."
"LUKE: All right, if you insist."
"CUT TO DRESSING ROOM"
"[Women are walking around getting ready. Lorelai walks in and over to Emily.]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Why aren't you dressed yet?"
"EMILY: I was waiting for you."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God, you're a paranoid woman."
"[Emily walks to the lady handing out clothes.]"
"EMILY: I'm Emily Gilmore."
"LADY: [hands her a garment bag] Okay, here you go. Where's Lorelai Gilmore?"
"LORELAI: Oh, right here."
"LADY: You two are together. [hands her a garment bag]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LADY: You're the mother-daughter team."
"LORELAI: Oh, no I'm"
"LADY: I have outfits for one mother-daughter team, your names are on the outfits, you're it."
"LORELAI: [unzips the garment bag] Ugh! Oh my God!"
"CUT TO FASHION SHOW"
"[A lady at a podium begins the fashion show.]"
"LADY: I want to welcome you here to the Chilton Booster Club's Annual Fall Festival Fundrasier, where all the proceeds from the evening go directly into the refurbishing of the Chilton auditorium. But enough about the kids. Tonight is about us, and without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, Saks presents a fabulous fall fashion extravaganza."
"[Music starts and ladies start walking down the runway. After a few models, Emily and Lorelai walk down the runway together wearing similar red outfits. They do several identical turns and motions, then walk off.]"
"CUT TO INN'S DINING ROOM"
"[After the fashion show, Lorelai, Emily, and 2 women are sitting at a table talking about the show.]"
"MENA: Well, I must say, this was definitely better than the salsa band."
"GINGER: Oh, people loved it, did you hear them? God, who picked that music?"
"LORELAI: Um, that'd be me."
"GINGER: It was terrific. The whole thing was terrific."
"LORELAI: Well, thank you."
"MENA: Oh, and hiring that actor to play a horrible, rude, annoying Frenchman. What a riot!"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, I thought that'd be fun."
"GINGER: You know, if you plan all these damn things, we wouldn't have to have anymore of those stupid meetings."
"LORELAI: Oh come on. Don't you want to see how long it actually takes Aubrey to finally learn that kid's name?"
"GINGER: Eh, you're right. Okay, I'll see you at the next meeting. Great job, really. It's the best event we've ever had."
"LORELAI: Well thanks Ginger. Bye Mena."
"MENA: Buh bye."
"[Ginger and Mena leave.]"
"LORELAI: What are you looking so ha-ha about?"
"EMILY: I'm not looking ha-ha."
"LORELAI: Yes you are."
"EMILY: All right. Whatever you say."
"LORELAI: Come on Mom, fess up."
"EMILY: Big success tonight."
"LORELAI: Seemed to be."
"EMILY: The ladies were thrilled. They adore you."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, that's because I'm adorable."
"EMILY: Funny isn't it?"
"LORELAI: What's funny?"
"EMILY: How nicely you seem to be fitting into the world that you ran away from. Well, goodnight Lorelai. Congratulations. [leaves]"
"[Lorelai looks around and gives a slightly sad look as she sees Luke talking to Ava]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is on the couch reading as Lorelai comes home from the fashion show.]"
"RORY: Is that you?"
"LORELAI: Nope."
"RORY: How was it?"
"LORELAI: Oh, fine. It ran smoothly, and the food was amazing. Michel only made three people cry."
"RORY: How was the fashion show?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you know, I walked up and down the ramp, looked pouty and sexy, now I'm ready for rehab. I brought you some Booster cake."
"RORY: Put it in the fridge please."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: How's Grandma?"
"LORELAI: Uh, mmm, good."
"RORY: I'm assuming that's your piece of cake and mine is safely in the fridge."
"LORELAI: Hmm, you're cute."
"RORY: Uh huh. So what'd you wear?"
"LORELAI: Oh, look at the time. I'm going to bed."
"RORY: Nobody took a picture of you?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no. Can you believe that?"
"RORY: You're holding onto that purse mighty tightly there missy."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I really love this purse."
"RORY: You have pictures in there."
"LORELAI: You calling your mother a liar?"
"RORY: Yes I am."
"LORELAI: Mm, well, that's why I ate your cake."
"[Lorelai hands Rory the purse, Rory takes out some pictures]"
"RORY: Oh my God!"
"LORELAI: Be nice."
"RORY: You look like Nancy Reagan."
"LORELAI: Oh, now how is that nice?"
"RORY: I don't believe this. You look so completely different. Elegant, understated."
"LORELAI: Yes, well I was wearing underwear with propellers on them if that makes you feel any better. I'm going to bed."
"RORY: I'll send the Secret Service up."
"LORELAI: Oh, uh, by the way, I would put on your good pajamas, you know, the cute ones with the cakes on them. And brush your hair and put on a little lip gloss."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: You're being kidnapped tonight. [goes upstairs]"
"RORY: Excuse me? [follows her]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai walks in followed by Rory.]"
"LORELAI: I got a call today from Francie."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she said that she and her friends were gonna come in while you're sleeping, wake you up, kidnap you and take you out to breakfast in your pajamas."
"RORY: Why would they do that?"
"LORELAI: Apparently it's fun."
"RORY: Well, that doesn't sound fun."
"LORELAI: She told me to leave a key under the mat and some money on the coffee table."
"RORY: And you said yes to this insanity?"
"LORELAI: Hey, I told you not to become a soc, but you didn't listen."
"RORY: I can't believe that you are going to let a group of strange girls come traipsing in here and take away your only child, your precious baby girl, and off to God knows where in the middle of the night."
"LORELAI: If it's someplace with doughnuts, bring me one, okay?"
"RORY: Fine."
"[Lorelai starts looking at her modeling pictures. Rory grabs them.]"
"LORELAI: Uhh! Hey!"
"RORY: Christmas Cards."
"LORELAI: More like your grandmother every day!"
"CUT TO LIVING ROOM"
"[Rory is sitting on the couch reading when she hears a car pull up out front.]"
"RORY: Mom, my kidnappers are here."
"LORELAI: Okay, have fun."
"[Rory turns out the living room light, goes into her room and pretends to be sleeping in her bed. A few seconds later, several girls with flashlights walk in.]"
"FRANCIE: Hit the lights."
"IVY: I can't find it."
"FRANCIE: Shh."
"[lights go on]"
"ALL: Surprise!"
"RORY: What's going on?"
"FRANCIE: Rise and shine."
"IVY: You can grab shoes, but no socks."
"RORY: Oh wow, this is totally unexpected. I'm completely surprised."
"FRANCIE: You looked it."
"IVY: Okay, let's move. We've still got a couple more girls to get."
"[all the girls but Paris walk out]"
"PARIS: So, that's how you look when you've just woken up?"
"RORY: Um, yeah."
"PARIS: Nothing in my life is fair."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[The Puffs are leading several blindfolded girls, including Rory and Paris, through the halls.]"
"FRANCIE: Okay, just a little further."
"GIRL: [bumps into lockers] Ow!"
"IVY: Shh!"
"GIRL: Sorry."
"FRANCIE: Okay, that's far enough. Ladies, here on the spot, tonight in this place, where so many others have come before you, we invite you to join us."
"IVY: Ladies, remove your blindfolds."
"RORY: We're at Chilton."
"FRANCIE: Keys please."
"RORY: What are we doing at Chilton?"
"PARIS: Will you please be quiet. We are being puffed."
"FRANCIE: What you are about to do and what you are about to say will remain forever between the members of the Puffs and only the members of the Puffs."
"[She unlocks the door. Everyone goes inside except for Rory, Paris and another girl.]"
"RORY: This is the headmaster's office. How did she get the keys? I'm sure he didn't give them to her."
"PARIS: Stop it. We are making very important social contacts here."
"RORY: Hey, I'm not looking for social contacts. I have friends. I'm fine."
"PARIS: Well, how nice it must be to be you. Maybe someday I'll stumble into a Disney movie and suddenly be transported into your body, and after living there awhile, I'll finally realize the beauty of myself. But until that moment, I'm going to go in there and I'm going to become a Puff. Now get out of my way."
"CUT TO HEADMASTER'S OFFICE"
"[The girls stand around his desk as Lem lights a candle.]"
"FRANCIE: The historical bell of Chilton, 120 years old. Every member of the Puffs has stood here under the cover of night to pledge her lifelong devotion to us. 'I pledge myself to the Puffs, loyal I'll always be, a P to start, 2 F's at the end, and a U sitting in between.'"
"RORY: Anne Sexton, right?"
"FRANCIE: Once you've finished your oath, you will ring the bell three times."
"IVY: Rory?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"IVY: You first."
"[Rory steps up to the desk.]"
"RORY: Um, I pledge myself to the Puffs"
"IVY: You have to hold the candle."
"[Rory picks up the candle]"
"RORY: I pledge myself to the Puffs, loyal I'll always be"
"FRANCIE: Sing out Louise."
"RORY: A P to start, 2 F's at the end, and a U sitting in between."
"[Rory rings the bell twice before the office doors burst open]"
"HEADMASTER: I wouldn't do that again Miss Gilmore."
"CUT TO HEADMASTER'S OFFICE"
"[All the girls are sitting down in the office as the Headmaster lectures them.]"
"HEADMASTER: Disappointment, disillusionment, frustration, astonishment. I suppose you could say I am experiencing all of these emotions. Finding some of Chilton's best and brightest acting in such a destructive, immoral and illegal manner will make all of us think long and hard about the manner in which we are educating you girls. But that is all in the future. How do we handle this now? Well, suspension will be considered, detention and extra credit to maintain your current GPA standing will be a given."
"RORY: This is unbelievable."
"HEADMASTER: What was that, Miss Gilmore?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"HEADMASTER: No, I distinctly heard you mumbling something in a rather disgruntled tone, I'd like to know what it was."
"RORY: I said this is unbelievable."
"HEADMASTER: And why is this unbelievable Miss Gilmore?"
"RORY: Because I didn't even want to be here in the first place."
"HEADMASTER: Oh, now Miss Gilmore"
"RORY: Things were going fine, my grades were good, I joined the paper. My routine was down."
"HEADMASTER: Your routine was"
"RORY: And I have friends. I have a steady boyfriend, and my mother and I are freakishly linked, and Lane and I have been best friends since kindergarten. But you don't see that because I don't live in this town, and if you don't see it then it must not be true. And you call me in here to lecture me because I'd rather read at lunch then endlessly discuss the euthanasia of homecoming."
"HEADMASTER: You're reading had"
"RORY: You told me and you told my mother that I needed to socialize, and if I didn't, it would be frowned upon and it would hurt me getting into Harvard."
"HEADMASTER: Well, yes, we did say that."
"RORY: So, I did it. I sat down at a table, a random table."
"FRANCIE: Random?"
"RORY: And the next thing I know, I'm being pulled out of my bed in the middle of the night and I'm blindfolded and then before I know it, I end up here with the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, reciting poetry and lighting candles, and now I'm gonna be suspended because I was trying to do what you told me? What's fair about that?"
"SECRETARY: Headmaster Charleston, the parents are starting to arrive."
"HEADMASTER: Thank you Mrs. Trager. All right ladies, we'll continue this conversation tomorrow and for many days after that. You may go. Miss Gilmore, I think that maybe you and I should talk some more. [the other girls leave]"
"RORY: About what?"
"HEADMASTER: About the fact that though I do feel it is important that students socialize, possibly we may have been a little hasty to judge in your case."
"RORY: Really? So does that mean that you might reconsider my suspension?"
"HEADMASTER: You're an excellent student. You deserve to go to Harvard. I wouldn't want to stand in the way of that. We'll talk tomorrow."
"RORY: Thank you."
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Parents are picking up their kids. Lorelai walks down the hallway over to Rory.]"
"LORELAI: What happened? The reception on the phone sucked, and all I heard was 'Rory' and 'Chilton' and 'get down here.' Who's butt do I have to kick?"
"RORY: We didn't go to breakfast."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: We came here. They broke into the Headmaster's office as the big initiation."
"LORELAI: Oh, those stupid girls."
"RORY: Mm hmm. Part of the initiation was ringing a bell. So that's what I was doing when security showed up and they called you."
"LORELAI: That's what you got busted for, ringing a bell?"
"RORY: Yeah, mm hmm."
"LORELAI: That's it? Bell ringing?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Uh, were you at least smoking a Cuban cigar while you were doing it?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No, I mean, bad girl. How many times have I told you not to ring bells?"
"RORY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: They can dent or scratch and they make dogs crazy. Who do you think you are, the hunchback of Notre Dame? Are you French, are you circular, I don't think so."
"RORY: I'm walking to the car now."
"LORELAI: Wait, hold on. How much trouble are you in? Should I go talk to the Headmaster?"
"RORY: No, I think it's gonna be okay."
"LORELAI: Okay. Aw, was it a big bell at least?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in and sits at the counter.]"
"LUKE: Hey, good party yesterday."
"LORELAI: Yeah, not bad."
"LUKE: Yeah, I like the new look. It was very high-class substitute teacher."
"LORELAI: Exactly what I was going for."
"LUKE: Coffee?"
"LORELAI: Oh, to go."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, uh, I feel a little weird even mentioning this to you."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Yesterday I saw you talking to Ava, you know, she's in my booster club?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I know who she is."
"LORELAI: Oh, good. Well, good. So anyhow, I saw you guys talking alone and it seemed kind of private, and she mentioned earlier that you didn't make her, you know, gag, so I just figured you guys were making some sort of plans to hang out. And see, the thing is, I just think it would be a little weird if you started dating a Chilton mom. Look, I know I have no right to say anything to you, but it's just, um, if you did date her, well, I'm in the Booster Club with her, which means that I'll hear things, and I don't know, it's just, I'd like to keep that Chilton life separate from my Stars Hollow life, so if there's any way that you could not date her, that would be really great."
"LUKE: Boy, I tell you, you've got nerve."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, I know this is your private business."
"LUKE: It is my private business."
"LORELAI: You don't see any validity to my side at all?"
"LUKE: I am a grown man. You cannot tell me who to date."
"LORELAI: I'm not telling you who to date, I'm telling you who not to date."
"LUKE: You can't tell me that either."
"LORELAI: Look"
"LUKE: I will date who I like, and if that screws with your plans, then sorry. And if you don't wanna hear things, then don't listen."
"LORELAI: But"
"LUKE: If you don't like it, you can just deal with it."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll just deal with it."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: I just thought that if something was going to affect our friendship in some way that you might care about that, because if the situation was reversed, then I would care, but hey, that's me, and sogo ahead, date her, marry her, make her Mrs. Backwards Baseball Cap, live happily ever after, see if I care. [starts to leave]"
"LUKE: And by the way, I wasn't asking her out. I was giving her directions for the quickest way back to Hartford. It was very romantic. I said you take a right at Deerfield, and you catch the I-5 and you take it south. Oh man, hot stuff."
"LORELAI: That is so typical of you."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: That is not the quickest way back to Hartford. Everybody knows that you take Maine to Cherry to Lynwood and then grab the I-11. Everybody knows that Luke. Everybody, apparently, but you! [leaves]"
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Rory walks in, sits at a table alone, puts on her walkman, and starts reading her book. A girl walks over to her.]"
"GIRL: Do you mind?"
"RORY: Oh, no."
"GIRL: Thanks."
"[The girl sits down with her lunch and starts reading. Rory smiles and continues reading.]"

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner.]"
"EMILY: How's the meal?"
"RORY: Tasty."
"LORELAI: Very tasty. New cook?"
"EMILY: Yes, Marisella. She's introduced us to some wonderful dishes so charmingly specific to her native country."
"LORELAI: What country is she from?"
"EMILY: One of those little ones next to Mexico."
"LORELAI: How charmingly specific."
"RORY: Too bad Grandpa's not here. He likes weird food."
"LORELAI: Yeah, where's he eating his weird food tonight? Argentina? Morocco?"
"EMILY: Akron."
"RORY: Ohio?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Get out of here."
"EMILY: I will not get out of here."
"LORELAI: No Mom, I didn't mean really get out of here, I mean"
"RORY: Why is Grandpa in Akron?"
"EMILY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: It was just a saying."
"EMILY: They sent him to deal with some problem with their local office down there."
"LORELAI: A saying, you know, like 'save me' or 'get me out of here'. Things like that."
"EMILY: Lorelai, would you like me to put a mirror in front of you so you can look at yourself while you have this conversation?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, Dad's in Akron."
"EMILY: Yes. The amenities are atrociously lacking. He had to eat at a coffee shop last night. The whole thing's terribly insulting. He's miserable."
"RORY: I hate that he's miserable."
"EMILY: So do I. We really ought to do something."
"RORY: Yes, I agree."
"LORELAI: Warning, warning."
"EMILY: I'm glad to hear you say that Rory, because I thought of a wonderful way to cheer him up."
"RORY: Cool, what?"
"LORELAI: Danger, Will Robinson, danger!"
"EMILY: An oil portrait of you for his study."
"RORY: An oil portrait."
"LORELAI: I tried, have fun."
"EMILY: It could hang right over his mantle. He'd just love it."
"RORY: Well, I guess that would be okay."
"LORELAI: Oh Mom, please, don't make her do this."
"EMILY: She just said she would."
"LORELAI: Fine, paint the picture, but don't make her sit and pose for it. Paint it from a photo."
"EMILY: A photo? That's what they do at malls."
"RORY: I'll sit, it's fine."
"EMILY: Just because your own experience sitting for a portrait was bad doesn't mean Rory's has to be."
"RORY: What portrait? I haven't seen this."
"LORELAI: They never finished."
"EMILY: Three painters started, and they all three quit."
"RORY: Why did they quit?"
"EMILY: She wouldn't stop scowling."
"LORELAI: I was going for a Billy Idol thing."
"EMILY: The one from Italy had some sort of breakdown."
"RORY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Hey, it didn't hurt Van Gogh, the guy should thank me."
"EMILY: A year later, I swear I saw him rummaging through our recyclables."
"RORY: Well, I'm happy to sit. If it's for Grandpa, why not?"
"EMILY: Wonderful. I'll set it up first thing in the morning."
"LORELAI: Psst. If you want, I can teach you the Billy Idol. Most people focus on the lip thing, but the eyes are just as import..."
"[Emily slams the salt shaker on the table. Lorelai stops talking.]"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Luke are sitting at a table talking.]"
"LUKE: So, the first thing you and Sookie would do is incorporate."
"LORELAI: Wow. Sounds so big time."
"LUKE: Not really. It just means you're a single business entity. You'll both be officers and shareholders, and you'll get to make up a name for your company and everything."
"LORELAI: Mmm, I'm terrible at coming up with names. When we first bought out house, Rory and I wanted to name it, you know, like Jefferson named his place Monticello, but all we could come up with is The Crap Shack."
"LUKE: Nice."
"[Jess walks over with a coffeepot]"
"JESS: Coffee?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, thanks. How are you Jess?"
"JESS: Well, I'm not bleeding or anything."
"LORELAI: Well, then it's gonna be a good day, huh?"
"JESS: Yeah. It's 7:45."
"LUKE: So?"
"JESS: So do you want me to go to school or do you want to openly defy child labor laws?"
"LUKE: Go. Stay out of trouble."
"JESS: Guess that means calling off the chickie run down at the salt flax."
"LUKE: Out. [Jess leaves]"
"LORELAI: Wow, so much love."
"LUKE: So, you guys have a site in mind for the inn?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LUKE: Great, where?"
"LORELAI: You've seen pictures of it. The Rachel property."
"LUKE: Oh, right."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"LUKE: It's okay."
"LORELAI: I just meant, Rachel took the pictures, and the pictures kind of got us into the place, so we started calling it the Rachel property 'cause it made sense at the time and then it became a habit. But now out of respect for you, I'm gonna stop repeatedly using her name and uh, think of another name to call it. Let's see, The Crap Shack's taken."
"LUKE: It's okay. Call it what you want."
"LORELAI: So, who taught you about all this business stuff? Your dad?"
"LUKE: Please. My dad didn't even have a checking account until I finally got taller then he was. He bought this land with cash from working construction, built this place himself. Didn't have a bookkeeper, an accountant, or anything."
"LORELAI: Wow, so you had no one showing you the ropes."
"LUKE: Nope, I figured I had to just dive in on my own, fail if that's my destiny, and forget what the experts say."
"LORELAI: That is exactly my philosophy. Exactly. Except I'm not diving in on my own, I'm diving in with Sookie, and, uh, failure is not even a choice of destinies, and I'm consulting any expert who will listen to me. Otherwise, it's identical."
"LUKE: Well, I should be getting going. You gonna write this meal off?"
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: Oh, we talked business. You gotta be thinking about these things."
"LORELAI: No, I mean, why? I'm not paying for it. [Luke sighs] Exactly."
"LUKE: You're gonna do fine."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are talking in the kitchen as Michel walks in.]"
"LORELAI: It shouldn't be too flashy."
"SOOKIE: How about something historical, like 'The Paul Revere'?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that could work."
"MICHEL: What could work?"
"LORELAI: We're thinking up names for the inn we're gonna open."
"SOOKIE: I mean, if you want simple, something like 'The Country Rose'."
"LORELAI: That's pretty good."
"SOOKIE: We could line the front path with multicolored roses."
"LORELAI: Or. . or 'The Inn by the Hollow'. Kind of long."
"SOOKIE: No, but nice."
"MICHEL: How about 'The Money Pit'?"
"LORELAI: Boo."
"MICHEL: Or 'The Outhouse'. Go international."
"SOOKIE: Go back in your hole."
"MICHEL: Or 'The Inn Heading for Bankruptcy'. Kind of long, but nice."
"SOOKIE: You who have no dreams rain on those who do."
"MICHEL: I say this because I care about you. It's risky what you are doing. Most new businesses go down within two years."
"LORELAI: I say if we go down after two years, it'll be the most exciting two years of our lives."
"SOOKIE: Same here. Boredom stinks."
"MICHEL: Fine, proceed blindly. [hands Lorelai some papers] Here, it came in ten minutes ago. It does not involve the Independence Inn, therefore delivering it was beyond my official obligations, so I am taking an extra long lunch break. [leaves]"
"SOOKIE: He's so genuine."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's the title search for the Rachel property. And guess who owns it."
"SOOKIE: Tell me it's not that bastard Donald Trump."
"LORELAI: Fran."
"SOOKIE: Fran from Weston's Bakery?"
"LORELAI: Sweet little Fran, the cupcake lady. Not some cigar-chomping, dirty dealing city slicker."
"SOOKIE: Ooh! That's good. Hey! 'The Country Slicker.' Funny name, cutesy idea"
"LORELAI: Mm, it's a little much."
"SOOKIE: It's way too much."
"LORELAI: I'll call Fran."
"SOOKIE: 'Fran's Old Place'! It'll be like Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. People will be trying to figure out who Fran is. Or 'The In Inn'! It's like an inn that's in with the in crowd. . .I'm gonna go sit down."
"LORELAI: Do that sweetie."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Taylor walks down the sidewalk to his store. Right in front of it, there is a chalk outline of a body on the sidewalk surrounded by police tape.]"
"CUT TO BAKERY"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table as Sookie walks in and sits down with her.]"
"SOOKIE: Honey, I'm so sorry. Am I late late or just late?"
"LORELAI: Two pieces of carrot cake and a rumball."
"SOOKIE: Ah, I am so sorry! I swear I meant to be on time, but I was prepping the raspberry glaze for tonight's dessert special, and it struck me. I made a blueberry glaze for the soufflé I made last Tuesday, and this is Tuesday, and a lot of locals come every week on the same night every week, and I just didn't want to serve them some. . .like a similar dessert even though it's a completely different berry. . ."
"LORELAI: I need another rumball."
"SOOKIE: Ah, I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: No, you're a perfectionist, and that attention to detail is why people call you the Maestro."
"SOOKIE: Really? Who calls me that?"
"LORELAI: The people who eat the rumballs."
"[Fran walks over to their table.]"
"FRAN: So ladies, how are we doing here?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, we're doing great Fran."
"FRAN: Oh, well that's wonderful."
"LORELAI: Fran, could Sookie and I talk to you for a couple minutes?"
"FRAN: Oh, of course. Marjorie can handle things. [sits down] Oooh."
"LORELAI: Fran, are you okay?"
"FRAN: Aw, it's this bum hip. It needs to be replaced, again. And I have this awful angina."
"SOOKIE: Oh, we're so sorry to hear that."
"FRAN: So, I know you didn't come here to listen to me gripe, so tell me what's on your mind."
"LORELAI: Okay, well Fran, we understand that you own the old Dragonfly Bed and Breakfast, that whole property out there."
"FRAN: Why, yes I do. It was my parents' business."
"SOOKIE: It's a beautiful place."
"FRAN: Oh, it used to be. But it's in such disarray now."
"LORELAI: Yes it is, and that's kind of why we're here. We'd actually like to buy it."
"FRAN: Buy the Dragonfly?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we'd like to buy it and make it beautiful again, and we're prepared to make you an offer right now."
"FRAN: Oh my, well this is a surprise."
"LORELAI: See, Sookie and I are gonna start our own inn and we've been searching for the perfect place."
"FRAN: Your own inn?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"FRAN: Oh how wonderful! You are going to be so successful."
"SOOKIE: Thanks Sweetie."
"LORELAI: That means so much, like we have your blessing."
"FRAN: But I can't sell you the property."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: How come?"
"FRAN: I just couldn't. You know, I have no siblings and no children and in a ways, that place is really the only family I have. I'm the last Weston left, so I plan to own it forever."
"LORELAI: Forever?"
"FRAN: Forever and ever."
"LORELAI: That's a very long time."
"SOOKIE: A very long time."
"FRAN: I'm so sorry."
"LORELAI: Fran, may I ask. . . um. . ."
"FRAN: Go ahead honey, ask me anything you want."
"LORELAI: Well, what happens to the place if you. . .well, if forever isn't quite forever?"
"FRAN: I don't understand dear. All I know is that I can't sell the place."
"LORELAI: Oh no, I don't mean selling it. I mean, you would keep it forever, but what happens once you're no longer in the position of physically controlling the property?"
"FRAN: How could that be?"
"LORELAI: Uh, well, if you um, if you"
"SOOKIE: Take a long vacation."
"LORELAI: Yes, take a long vacation. Thank you."
"SOOKIE: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: And when you're on that long vacation, the property is just left sitting there. Well, what happens then?"
"FRAN: Oh, I don't enjoy vacations. I toured the California gold country ten years ago, it was hot and the bus smelled."
"LORELAI: Okay, I mean a longer vacation than a trip to California."
"SOOKIE: To a different place."
"FRAN: What kind of place?"
"LORELAI: A place out there."
"SOOKIE: Way out there Fran."
"FRAN: Europe?"
"LORELAI: I mean the ultimate long vacation."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, Francie, eventually, we're all gonna take the same long vacation."
"LORELAI: And with that being the case, you might want to sell the property now and enjoy the money."
"FRAN: I'm very sorry, but I can never sell the place."
"LORELAI: Oh, well thanks for your time Fran."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, thanks Fran."
"FRAN: Bye now."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"SOOKIE: Bye."
"FRAN: You both look so sad. Would you like a cupcake?"
"LORELAI: Please."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"FRAN: Good."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the sidewalk in Stars Hollow.]"
"LANE: So, Janie Fertman's trying to be my friend again."
"RORY: Yikes. What kind of vibe are you giving her?"
"LANE: Oh, my patented Keith Richards circa 1969 'don't mess with me' vibe, with a thousand-yard Asian stare thrown in."
"RORY: That should do it."
"[They see a police car and a large crowd down the street in front of Doose's market]"
"RORY: What's happening up there?"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[A crowd has gathered around the chalk outline.]"
"POLICEWOMAN: Just try to calm down Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Calm down! Why should I calm down?"
"BOOTSY: Yeah, why should he calm down?"
"TAYLOR: I want action not words."
"BOOTSY: Yeah, action not words."
"TAYLOR: Don't you need to get back to your newsstand, Bootsy?"
"BOOTSY: No buddy, I'm all yours."
"POLICEWOMAN: We're gonna get to the bottom of this, I promise you."
"TAYLOR: A crime was committed right in front of my store."
"POLICEWOMAN: Now, we can't say that for sure yet."
"TAYLOR: How come you can't say that for sure? This is a police tape. You're the police, you own the tape!"
"POLICEWOMAN: Taylor, we've contacted everyone in the precinct. No one knows anything about this."
"TAYLOR: Well, what am I supposed to do? I've got a dead body right in front of my store!"
"POLICEWOMAN: No, you have a chalk outline of a dead body in front of your store."
"BOOTSY: Meaning that there were two crimes."
"POLICEWOMAN: What?"
"BOOTSY: What do you mean what? Somebody got m*rder, then somebody stole the body. It's open and shut, bing bang boom."
"POLICEWOMAN: Is this your son?"
"TAYLOR: I should say not."
"BOOTSY: Oh."
"POLICEWOMAN: Look, my partner's doing a headcount to see if anyone in town is missing. Until then, just hang tight. [leaves]"
"[Rory and Lane walk up to Dean in the crowd.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"DEAN: I don't know. I got here and this is what I found. I mean, I told him it looked fake, but he didn't believe me."
"RORY: And you have such an honest face."
"DEAN: Well, he must not love me as much as you do."
"LANE: Okay, you two are officially sickening. [leaves]"
"[The policewoman walks up to Taylor]"
"POLICEWOMAN: Everyone's accounted for Taylor. It looks like this is just an elaborate prank."
"TAYLOR: But it looks so real. Where'd they get the police tape?"
"POLICEWOMAN: Kids have their ways."
"TAYLOR: Who'd be depraved enough to pull a stupid prank like this?"
"POLICEWOMAN: Hard to say."
"[Rory sees Jess standing across the street smirking as he watches the crowd]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Rory is sitting at a table doing work, Lorelai is getting coffee, Sookie is cooking.]"
"RORY: Mom, you're not writing what you purchased on the back of any of the inn's credit cards receipts."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, just put cooking spray and sponges."
"RORY: Okay. And when an auditor wants to know why you need such large amounts of cooking spray and sponges?"
"LORELAI: Then I drop my pencil and I put the scoop neck sweater that I'm now making a mental note to wear to good use."
"RORY: Well at least you've got a solid well thought out plan."
"SOOKIE: I had a dream last night about us and Fran."
"LORELAI: Oh, what was it?"
"SOOKIE: Well, it was in the future and we were all old, you and me and Rory and Jackson and Michel, everyone. Gray hair, walking around with canes, we're all kind of ailing, you know? I had those big cataract glasses on. You were hard of hearing and kept going, Huh? Huh?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's attractive."
"RORY: Its you kids with your rock and roll."
"SOOKIE: But wuh-ho, here walks up Fran, and guess what. She looks exactly the same, even better."
"LORELAI: Ugh! That's not fair."
"SOOKIE: That woman is gonna live forever."
"LORELAI: Not necessarily. Hey, did you look up angina? I forgot to."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, it's nothing major."
"RORY: You guys have got to stop talking like this."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"RORY: We love Fran, remember? Fran is great."
"SOOKIE: No, honey, of course we love Fran. We just wanna know what God's little plan is for her, that's all."
"[Michel walks into the kitchen]"
"MICHEL: I would advise at least pretending to look busy, the boss is here."
"RORY: Mia!"
"LORELAI: You're kidding! When?"
"MICHEL: I just spotted her walking in."
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out from the kitchen over to Mia.]"
"RORY: Mia!"
"MIA: Uh! Oh my babies! Ooh! [hugs them]"
"RORY: Did we know you were coming?"
"MIA: I didn't know I was coming."
"LORELAI: This isn't a surprise inspection is it?"
"MIA: That's exactly what this is. Ready? Oh, you're too thin as always."
"RORY: But we eat."
"MIA: And you're both too beautiful."
"LORELAI: Yes, that's true. We often feel guilty monopolizing the amount of beauty we're in possession of."
"MIA: And I don't see you enough which is my fault, so you both pass."
"LORELAI: Aww."
"[Michel walks over to them]"
"MIA: Ooh Michel. Ooh, how nice to see you. Uh, and look at that suit. You are quite the dandy, aren't you?"
"MICHEL: Well, I had a feeling that a lovely woman was going to be visiting today so I decided I must look my best for her."
"MIA: I'm sorry honey, I didn't catch a word of that."
"RORY: He said he missed you."
"MIA: You've been in the U.S. quite some time Michel, your enunciation really should be better by now."
"MICHEL: The customers seem to understand me just fine."
"MIA: I didn't get that either. Did you get the tapes I sent you?"
"LORELAI: Hey, maybe you should hit the desk. A couple of people are looking for help."
"MICHEL: Right away. Mia, uh, I. . . [salutes and walks behind the desk]"
"MIA: So, are you too busy to sneak out with me for a walk?"
"RORY: Not if it's okay with the boss."
"MIA: It's a demand at this point."
"LORELAI: Let's go. Michel, hold down the fort?"
"MICHEL: Oh, it's a little slow now, so it's no problem."
"RORY: Oh, he says that he's never liked you and that you're a problem."
"MICHEL: I said no such thing!"
"MIA: I don't know where this hostility comes from. Can we work this out?"
"MICHEL: There's nothing to work out."
"RORY: He told you to get out."
"MICHEL: I did not!"
"MIA: I don't know what I did to make him hate me."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is at the counter fixing a toaster as Lorelai, Rory and Mia walk in]"
"MIA: Look at this place, it's exactly the same."
"LORELAI: Actually, I made him paint it a few months ago."
"MIA: Well, good for you."
"[Luke walks over and hugs Mia]"
"LUKE: Mia hey!"
"MIA: Nice to see you Lucas."
"LUKE: You're the only person in the world who can call me that, Mia."
"MIA: I know this."
"LUKE: I'm saying it for others who plan to try it later."
"LORELAI: Whatever Lucas."
"LUKE: Mia, you know anything about toasters?"
"MIA: Not a damn thing."
"LUKE: Well, then sit down and let me get you some coffee."
"[Luke goes to get coffee as they sit down at a table.]"
"LORELAI: So, Mia, how's living in Santa Barbara?"
"MIA: Horrible. Did you know the damn sun shines all the time out there?"
"RORY: They've written songs about that."
"MIA: Well, no one told me that's how it was. Half of my wardrobe is obsolete."
"LORELAI: Aw, drag. Hey, you know that vintagey blue coat?"
"MIA: You're not getting it."
"LORELAI: Right."
"[Jess walks up to Luke, who's fixing the toaster again.]"
"JESS: You're making that worse."
"LUKE: Big help, thanks."
"LORELAI: Luke's nephew."
"MIA: Luke, that's your nephew?"
"[Luke brings their coffee to the table]"
"LUKE: It's Liz's kid. Jess, this is Mia, she owns the Independence Inn."
"JESS: Huh."
"LUKE: That's 'Hello, nice to meet you' in slacker."
"JESS: You don't need me down here, do you? [leaves]"
"LUKE: I'm sorry Mia. He's just"
"MIA: Oh please, forget it. You weren't exactly a talkative boy yourself when you were his age."
"LORELAI: That's right, you knew Luke as a boy."
"RORY: I can't imagine Luke as a boy."
"LUKE: Can we change the subject?"
"MIA: He would help people carry groceries home."
"RORY: Oh, how very Boy Scout-y of you."
"MIA: For a quarter a bag."
"LORELAI: Oh, how very John Birch Society-y of you."
"MIA: He was never without his skateboard for a time."
"LORELAI: Were you any good?"
"LUKE: I could hold my own."
"MIA: And there was that year you wore the same shirt everywhere you went."
"LUKE: I don't remember that."
"LORELAI: Must have been something flannel."
"MIA: No, it was from that TV show. That famous one."
"LUKE: It's not important."
"MIA: Star Trek, that's it!"
"[Lorelai and Rory laugh]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, oh my God!"
"LUKE: Stop it."
"RORY: You were a Trekkie?"
"LUKE: I was not a Trekkie."
"LORELAI: Uh uh, I do believe that denying you were a Trekkie is a violation of the prime directive."
"RORY: Indubitably captain."
"LUKE: It was a gift from my aunt, I wore it to make her happy."
"LORELAI: I've never wanted to make any aunt of mine that happy."
"MIA: Did I say something I shouldn't have?"
"LORELAI: Oh no Mia, that's okay. I just have to cancel everything I have scheduled for the next three months 'cause I'll still be laughing my ass off."
"[Taylor walks into the diner.]"
"TAYLOR: Luke, I need to talk to you right now."
"LUKE: What is it Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: I have conducted a thorough investigation of all the people who may have inadvertently been witness to the phony m*rder at my store last night."
"MIA: There was a phony m*rder?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, the town's too dull to work up a real m*rder."
"RORY: But you're one 'beam me up Scotty' reference away from being the victim of one."
"LORELAI: Mm."
"TAYLOR: Luke, are you going to listen?"
"LUKE: What's this got to do with me?"
"TAYLOR: Three people have reported seeing Jess in that area late last night, skulking, lurking."
"LUKE: There were a lot of people out late last night. I know because I fed some of them. I'll give you their names so you can add them to your suspect list."
"TAYLOR: Another person witnessed Jess walking out of an arts and crafts store two days ago with what appeared to be chalk."
"LUKE: You appear to be bugging me Taylor."
"TAYLOR: What are you gonna do about it Luke?"
"LUKE: About what?"
"TAYLOR: About the results of my investigation."
"LUKE: Absolutely nothing, but thanks for the info."
"TAYLOR: You have to do something. People want action."
"LUKE: People, meaning you."
"TAYLOR: Not just me. I speak for the Stars Hollow Business Association, the Stars Hollow Tourist Board, the Stars Hollow Neighborhood Watch Organization, and the Stars Hollow Citizens for a Clean Stars Hollow Council."
"LUKE: All of which are you."
"TAYLOR: So are you going to act."
"LUKE: Yes I am. I'm gonna act like you never came in here."
"TAYLOR: Fine, have it your own way. But I warn you, there's gonna be a lot of unhappy people at S.H.B.A., the S.H.T.B., the S.H.N.W.O. and the S.H.C.C.S.H.C."
"LUKE: F-I-N-E."
"TAYLOR: Oh, you're. . .you're impossible, you are impossible! [starts to leave] Oh, hi Mia."
"MIA: Nice to see you Taylor. [Taylor leaves] Ah, I gotta get out of Santa Barbara. I miss the small town theater. And I miss you. Hey, do you realize it was fifteen years ago almost to the day?"
"LORELAI: Yes it was."
"RORY: What was?"
"MIA: To the day when this skinny little teenage girl showed up at the inn. She had this tiny little thing in her arms."
"LORELAI: A little thing named Rory. [pinches Rory's cheeks]"
"RORY: Okay, no physical reenactments."
"MIA: You marched up to me, looked me right in the eye and said, 'I'm here for a job. Any job.'"
"LORELAI: Well, IBM had turned me down for the CEO slot, so I was desperate."
"MIA: Work experience none, recommendations none, k*ll"
"LORELAI: Besides flawlessly applying mascara in a moving car, none."
"MIA: Not one thing to recommend hiring her. Just thathow do I put it and remain a ladythat 'who cares' look in her eyes, so I gave her any job. The other maids hated you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well they were all so slow."
"MIA: You were special."
"RORY: Mia, why don't you move back here? We miss you."
"LORELAI: Or at least visit more? You used to check in. You never come at all."
"MIA: I don't have to. You've made me redundant."
"LORELAI: I have not."
"MIA: Don't be humble. The inn is beyond covered. It's never run this well or been this successful. That inn is like your place now. Without you I wouldn't know what to do, I'd be lost."
"LORELAI: Lost, yeah."
"RORY: Yeah."
"MIA: You look sad now, why?"
"LORELAI: Oh, nothing."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie is cooking while Lorelai talks to her.]"
"LORELAI: In all the excitement, I hadn't thought about telling Mia. What is wrong with me?"
"SOOKIE: Nothing is wrong with you."
"LORELAI: I feel terrible. I should've told her before. I should've told her the day the idea occurred to us. She deserved that. [phone rings] After all she's done for me. [answers phone] Hello?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, your daughter's being impossible. She won't pose in an appropriate manner."
"RORY: I'm trying to Grandma. It's just awkward."
"LORELAI: Let me guess how you're posing her. She's in a silly gown on a silly chair with both of her hands raised in some silly way."
"EMILY: No, just the one hand is raised, and none of it's silly."
"LORELAI: Pick a simpler pose, Mom."
"EMILY: This is the simplest, and it wasn't my choice."
"LORELAI: And your choice is"
"EMILY: I wanted the swan to sit regally aside Rory's throne."
"LORELAI: Swan? Throne?"
"EMILY: Oh, now you have a problem with swans and thrones."
"LORELAI: Because swans and thrones scream one thing Mom, Siegfried and Roy."
"EMILY: Who?"
"LORELAI: Make a change Mom."
"EMILY: I suppose you'd just have her sitting in a chair reading a book."
"LORELAI: Now that sounds great."
"EMILY: Oh, be serious."
"LORELAI: I am. That's a completely natural pose for Rory. And a painting of her reading that's gonna be hung in Dad's study seems just crazy enough to work."
"EMILY: Well, maybe it's not such a bad idea."
"LORELAI: Give it a try. And let her lower her arm."
"EMILY: Rory, you can lower your arm."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[swan honks]"
"EMILY: I think he's just hungry. We're going to lose the swan."
"LORELAI: Good going Mom. Bye. [hangs up] Ugh. So how do I do this? How..howhow do I tell Mia that I'm leaving?"
"SOOKIE: Get her drunk first?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I can't believe it. I'm gonna let down the one person in my life who was there for me when I needed it the most. I'm great, aren't I?"
"[Mia and Michel enter the kitchen]"
"MIA: I wanted to put it on the front desk but I think it might be a tad short."
"MICHEL: Well, we could get a carpenter to build up a base and raise it up two inches and then it would be perfect."
"MIA: Great idea. Hey, I got that, every word!"
"MICHEL: Yes!"
"MIA: Oh, oh, I'm so proud!"
"[Michel and Mia leave]"
"SOOKIE: So you gonna tell her now or later?"
"LORELAI: Later, because she's so happy that she can finally understand Michel and that the lamp is fixed and that..."
"SOOKIE: [clucks like a chicken]"
"LORELAI: And that too."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Mia walk down the street towards Miss Patty's]"
"RORY: We're late."
"LORELAI: We're not late."
"RORY: The last time we were late, Taylor said that there would be consequences."
"LORELAI: He did not. He said there would be severe consequences."
"RORY: Mia, what time is it? Are we late?"
"MIA: I hope so."
"LORELAI: Mia!"
"MIA: I'm sorry, but it's been two years since I've gotten to go to a town meeting and I want some controversy."
"[Lorelai sees Luke in front of the diner, locking up]"
"LORELAI: Aha!"
"LUKE: Geez! Don't sneak up on me like that."
"LORELAI: Yeah, boy, I was lucky you had your phasers on stun, huh?"
"RORY: Well, at least we're not late. Luke's never late."
"LUKE: Actually, we're 2 minutes early."
"RORY: Ha! We should get a prize for being on time."
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, let's go back to the diner and get some pie as our reward for being on time."
"LUKE: Then you'd be late."
"LORELAI: A funny conundrum, but I want pie."
"LUKE: You're harassing me now."
"LORELAI: I'm not harassing you. We're your groupies. [in high voice] Oh Luke, you're so dreamy, be my guy!"
"RORY: [in high voice] No, be my guy!"
"LUKE: I'm bringing up the need for more police protection at this thing."
"[they walk into the town meeting, which has already started]"
"MIA: I think we're late."
"LUKE: What's going on here?"
"TAYLOR: Uh, nothing."
"LUKE: Meeting was supposed to start at eight Taylor, it's a minute to eight."
"TAYLOR: Well..."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, you might as well be honest with him Taylor."
"LORELAI: Be honest with him about what?"
"TAYLOR: Well, if you must know, there was a special issue that the business community had to deal with first, so we decided to start early tonight."
"LUKE: I'm in the business community and I wasn't told about it. Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: All right, fine. You weren't invited Luke."
"LUKE: And why is that?"
"MIA: Controversy."
"TAYLOR: You weren't invited because we are dealing with the Jess situation."
"LUKE: The Jess situation?"
"LORELAI: Uh oh. If this was the wild west, we'd be pushing the horse aside and diving into the water trough right about now."
"LUKE: Dammit Taylor!"
"MISS PATTY: Luke, honey, calm down."
"TAYLOR: After all, this is all your doing. If you hadn't so cavalierly dismissed the issue, we wouldn't have had to do this. I lost business because of what your hooligan nephew did."
"LUKE: How was business lost Taylor? If you had to open a little late that day, your customers just came back later."
"TAYLOR: Not so. When Mrs. Lanahan couldn't buy her head of lettuce that morning for her lunch, she drove straight to Woodbury to buy lettuce from a competing market. Isn't that right Mrs. Lanahan? Mrs. Lanahan?"
"LORELAI: You really shouldn't be driving anymore."
"TAYLOR: Word has it that she was telling other Doose market shoppers that Woodbury lettuce is crisper. That's business flying out the door."
"LUKE: Okay fine. How much is a head of lettuce, a buck? Oh, let's go crazy, give me five heads."
"TAYLOR: This goes well beyond a head of lettuce, young man. The charges against your nephew are numerous. He stole the 'save the bridge' money..."
"LUKE: He gave that back."
"TAYLOR: He stole a gnome from Babette's garden."
"LUKE: Pierpont was also returned."
"MISS PATTY: He hooted one of my dance classes."
"FRAN: He took a garden hose from my yard."
"MAN: My son said he set off the fire alarms at school last week."
"LORELAI: I heard he controls the weather and wrote the screenplay to Glitter."
"BOOTSY: I think it's time for me to pipe up here."
"LUKE: Oh yeah, that'll be good."
"BOOTSY: I have every right to pipe in here Luke. I'm a local entrepreneur."
"LUKE: You took over your father's newsstand Bootsy, it doesn't make you an entrepreneur."
"BOOTSY: And you took over your old man's hardware store."
"LUKE: And turned it into a diner."
"BOOTSY: Big whoop. Who can't fry an egg?"
"TAYLOR: Let's keep it moving here boys, huh?"
"BOOTSY: I never liked the look of that kid from the second I saw him."
"LUKE: Unbelievable."
"BOOTSY: Excuse me, but I've got the floor."
"LUKE: You don't have the floor."
"BOOTSY: I'm standing, aren't I?"
"LUKE: Well I was standing first which means I have the floor and I'm not giving it to you."
"TAYLOR: What is with you too?"
"BOOTSY: This goes way beyond the Jess matter Taylor. Luke's been on my case since the first grade when he wrongfully accused me of sabotaging a clay imprint that he made of his hand."
"LORELAI: Ooh! Think hard, was he dressed like Sulu?"
"LUKE: No one cares about the stupid clay hand Bootsy. And you stomped on it while it was drying. Three kids saw you."
"BOOTSY: No I didn't."
"LUKE: You did too!"
"BOOTSY: No I didn't."
"TAYLOR: Boys, please. The bottom line here is that there is a consensus among townspeople who are in agreement that Stars Hollow was a better place before Jess got here."
"LUKE: So this half of the room gets the tar, and the other half gets the feathers?"
"TAYLOR: Well, there hasn't been any talk of tar and feathers. Although"
"LUKE: Look, I've lived in this town my entire life, longer than most everybody here."
"BOOTSY: I beg to differ. I'm five weeks older than you, that means I've been here five weeks longer."
"LUKE: I've never bothered anyone. I've kept to myself and I've done the best I could. I pay my taxes, and I help people when I can. I haven't pitched in on the decorative pageantry town stuff because it all seems insane to me, but I don't get in the way of that stuff either."
"TAYLOR: What's your point, Luke?"
"LORELAI: His point isdo you mind?"
"LUKE: Be my guest."
"LORELAI: His point is, that if there's a problem"
"LUKE: And I'm not saying there's a problem."
"LORELAI: Right, he's not saying there is a problem, but if there it, give him time to deal with it before you storm his diner with torches and pitchforks."
"LUKE: Right. What I'm dealing with, being a problem, that I don't necessarily agree that I even have."
"LORELAI: Right."
"TAYLOR: I didn't get that last part."
"LORELAI: Lay off him because what you're all doing stinks."
"LUKE: I'm done here. I'm done with all of you. Oh, and I was gonna stay open later in case anyone wanted to eat after the meeting. Forget that. [leaves]"
"BOOTSY: His turkey burgers are very dry."

"CUT TO OUTSIDE MISS PATTY'S"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Mia walk out of the town meeting.]"
"MIA: Well, I must say that was quite exciting."
"LORELAI: A little disturbing. I think the whole town needs a field trip."
"RORY: Do you think Luke's okay?"
"LORELAI: I think he will be. He just needs to cool off a little."
"RORY: Hey, I'm gonna go check on Dean. He's been scraping that outline off the cement for two days now."
"LORELAI: Good idea. There's nothing like your face on his to make the cleaning process go faster."
"RORY: She's all yours Mia."
"MIA: I'll take her."
"LORELAI: Bye hon. [Rory leaves]"
"MIA: Oh, I am just having the most wonderful time. And I am so proud of you and Rory. You both have just come so far."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we have. Um, Mia, I need to talk to you about something."
"MIA: Of course. What is it, honey?"
"LORELAI: Well, um, it's really hard, and uh, I should've brought it up ages ago, but Sookie and I are thinking of making a change."
"MIA: A change?"
"LORELAI: We're going to open our own inn."
"MIA: Oh!"
"LORELAI: I mean, we've talked about it for a long time and it seems like the time is right andOh Mia, I love the Independence Inn and Sookie loves it too and we both love you so much."
"MIA: I know."
"LORELAI: But it just feels like something we need to do andyou hate me."
"MIA: No I don't."
"LORELAI: I'm letting you down. I'm walking out. I'm being ungrateful."
"MIA: Lorelai, stop. Do you think I was naïve enough to think that you'd work for me forever? You and Sookie have more talent for this business than I do. And I'm very good. You're going to open an incredible place, and if you don't let me help you in any way I can, then I'll be very mad."
"LORELAI: Of course, we need your help. We'd be lost without your help."
"MIA: Good. I was just wondering, what's the time frame for this big move?"
"LORELAI: Well, we're waiting for this perfect location to free up, that's all that's delaying us. But I promise you'll have plenty of notice and I'll be there to find our replacements and train them."
"MIA: Oh yes, that's very sweet of you, but I'm wondering if you could possibly make it sooner rather than later?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"MIA: Well, you see, your leaving gives me the perfect excuse to finally sell the place."
"LORELAI: Sell the place?"
"MIA: Oh, I get offers all the time, lucrative ones, but I never even considered it because. . . oh, of course I love the inn, but I just couldn't do that to you. And now that you have this big change coming up in your life, it might be time for one in mine."
"LORELAI: Oh. Good, uh, good. Then it all works out good."
"MIA: Actually, it's very good!"
"LORELAI: Okay. Wellgood."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai sits at a table in the lobby organizing placecards as Sookie walks over to her with a piece of paper]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"SOOKIE: Hey. So I'm working on the menu for the Duncan wedding."
"LORELAI: I can't read that."
"SOOKIE: I know. I had it all typed up nice and neat to begin with but on the drive into work, I got an inspiration. I just started crossing it out and writing in the new stuff. And it ain't easy writing and driving, andI can't read that. What is that - cumin?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, I can't read that either."
"SOOKIE: Oh. I'll just get you a new one. Hey, how did your talk with Mia go?"
"LORELAI: Fine. Good. She took it like you said she would - classy."
"SOOKIE: She is classy. Good, good. That's a relief. It is a relief right? I mean, you said she took it good?"
"LORELAI: Yes she did."
"SOOKIE: But you look upset."
"LORELAI: She's gonna sell the inn."
"SOOKIE: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: No, she said she gets offers and she thinks this might be kind of fortuitous timing for her."
"SOOKIE: Well, great, so everybody wins, that's good. Look happy. Okay, this does not look happy."
"LORELAI: I just don't understand how she can do this."
"SOOKIE: What's the big deal?"
"LORELAI: The big deal isshe's not gonna sell it to another Mia. It's gonna be a big chain, and they'll come marching in with their business models and their corporate approved architects and designers, and change everything around and remodel, and the place will lose all its personality and charm."
"SOOKIE: Well, I hope they don't do that, but hey, our place is gonna be full of charm."
"LORELAI: So you don't care what happens to this place?"
"SOOKIE: Of course I do, but it's not up to me. I mean, I can't control that. The only thing we can control is what our inn's gonna be like."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"SOOKIE: You guess what?"
"LORELAI: We'll see."
"SOOKIE: We'll see what?"
"LORELAI: It's just a little short sided to just write off this place when we haven't even bought Fran's yet and, hey, we don't know if we will."
"[Lorelai walks to the dining room, Sookie follows her.]"
"SOOKIE: We don't? Why wouldn't we? Lorelai. Is this about Fran's life expectancy because I"
"LORELAI: No Sookie, it's about the fact that we haven't even looked at any other places and we don't know if that's necessarily the right one and we have to be very practical about this."
"SOOKIE: But it's the perfect location. We all said so."
"LORELAI: Well, you can't get emotionally attached to any of our decisions about the inn. This is business. You've got to stay detached."
"SOOKIE: But we are all so not detached. Butokay, do you have another location in mind?"
"LORELAI: Not really."
"SOOKIE: Do you wanna look for a new location?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, like I have all this time to go looking for other locations."
"SOOKIE: Well, I don't know. Should we try to buy this place?"
"LORELAI: Aha. This place is five times what we can afford."
"SOOKIE: So what do we do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It's on hold, I guess."
"SOOKIE: Well, it's been on hold for years. We were moving forward."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I'm looking at the economy right now and I'm thinking, I don't know if the timing's good."
"SOOKIE: Okay, that's not fair because I don't know anything about the economy."
"LORELAI: Oh, well then good thing you hooked up with me because it's not looking good."
"SOOKIE: Okay, what happened?"
"LORELAI: What do you mean, what happened?"
"SOOKIE: We had a vision, we had a plan. You're the one that got this whole ball rolling again, and I jumped on the ball, and then we were rolling on the ball together and then you hopped off the ball, and I'm still on the ball. And I'm confused, 'cause I see it, and I see our vision, and you saw it too up until today!"
"LORELAI: Well, I know you would like things to be simple and straightforward but unfortunately things are more complicated."
"SOOKIE: Okay, that's why we'd be partners. If something gets too heavy for the one person, the other one's there to pick up the slack."
"LORELAI: Yes, well that's great in theory, but I gotta tell you, my back is aching from all the extra slack I'm taking up!"
"SOOKIE: What did I do that's so wrong?"
"LORELAI: Let's not get into this stuff."
"SOOKIE: No, get into it."
"LORELAI: Well, you're not the most reliable person in the world or the most punctual."
"SOOKIE: You've always known that about me."
"LORELAI: Yes, but now, getting into business, it's not so cute. It could hurt us. I mean, you were late for the Fran meeting, you're constantly changing every menu you ever set, even after you've started making it."
"SOOKIE: I don't believe this! Before it was kudos to me for my attention to detail. I was the maestro."
"LORELAI: That's fine for an established place like the Independence, but you do that stuff at our place, it could wipe us out. Profit margins in a new business are slim, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Just stop. Just stop. Now you're talking down to me."
"LORELAI: I'm not talking down to you, I'm trying to explain."
"SOOKIE: Yes you are. Yes you are, and I don't know why you are, but I don't want to start crying in front of you because it'll just give you one more thing to point at to say, 'Look, she's too emotional and she's too weak for me to go into business with,' so I'm leaving. And I'll see you tomorrow, if I can remember to show up."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Rory and Dean are walking down the street.]"
"DEAN: Hey, I gotta drop by the market."
"RORY: But it's your day off."
"DEAN: Yeah, it's to get my paycheck. If I don't get it by four, Taylor locks it in a safe and it's on some kind of timer and then when I complain, he lectures me about promptly putting checks in the back and the theories of compound interest, and then my head hurts from all the nodding I do even though I don't listen"
"RORY: Go, go!"
"DEAN: I'll just be a minute."
"[Dean walks into the market. Rory waits outside. Jess walks up to her.]"
"JESS: Should you be standing here all alone? I hear this is a pretty dangerous corner."
"RORY: I'm fine."
"JESS: Feeling succinct today?"
"RORY: Pretty much."
"JESS: Hmm. Did I do something to offend?"
"RORY: Me?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Good."
"RORY: You might want to ask that same question to Luke though."
"JESS: Meaning?"
"RORY: You've got this whole town down on him."
"JESS: Really? How did I do that?"
"RORY: You know how you did that."
"JESS: I'm not really familiar with the blue book laws in this town, so you can be talking about a lot of things. Dropping a gum wrapper, strolling arm in arm with a member of the opposite sex on a Sunday. [Rory gestures to the chalk outline] Ah. What about it?"
"RORY: You did it. The whole town knows you did it. They had a meeting about it."
"JESS: You actually went to that bizarro town meeting? Those things are so 'To k*ll a Mockingbird.'"
"RORY: Yes, I went. And Luke went. And when he got there, everyone ganged up on him. They all want you gone."
"JESS: Wow, bummer."
"RORY: And he's standing there yelling at everyone and defending you and paying Taylor back for his lettuce losses"
"JESS: Wait, his what?"
"RORY: And now Luke's a pariah and it's all because of you! What a shock, you don't care about any of this."
"JESS: I didn't say that."
"RORY: Go. I'm tired of talking to you."
"JESS: Fine. [starts to walk away]"
"RORY: You care nothing about Luke and his feelings!"
"JESS: Got a second wind, huh? [walks back over to Rory]"
"RORY: All he does is stick up for you and all you do is make his life harder. I guess that's what you have to do when you're trying to be Holden Caulfield but I think it stinks. Luke has done a lot for my mom and a lot for me, and I don't like to see him attacked. Okay, second wind over."
"JESS: I didn't know they were coming down so hard on him."
"RORY: Funny, I never pegged you as clueless, my mistake."
"JESS: Okay. I get it. No, no, I do, I get it. So did you at least think it was funny?"
"RORY: That is so not the point."
"JESS: Ah, you thought it was funny."
"[Dean walks out of the market]"
"DEAN: I got it. Oh, uh, hey."
"RORY: Um Dean, I don't think you two have met. This is Jess. This is Dean."
"JESS: Boyfriend?"
"RORY: Of course."
"JESS: Sorry, you didn't say. How ya doing?"
"DEAN: Good, good."
"RORY: Okay, see you around."
"JESS: Seems to turn out that way, doesn't it?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the front door]"
"RORY: I wonder if Grandpa's still in Akron?"
"LORELAI: Well for Akron's sake, I hope he's moved on to Boise. [rings doorbell; the maid answers] Hi. We're the daughter and the granddaughter."
"[they walk inside]"
"RORY: You are majorly crabby."
"LORELAI: I just have a headache."
"EMILY: Oh Good! Come, come, come, it's all done, and it's great."
"CUT TO STUDY"
"[they walk in and Emily shows them Rory's portrait]"
"EMILY: Tada."
"RORY: Whoa."
"EMILY: What do you think?"
"RORY: It's freaky."
"EMILY: Freaky?"
"RORY: Well, just seeing me here, up on the wall like that, it's uh. . . I like it though. It's good, I guess. I should probably take myself out of the judging process."
"EMILY: I think Richard's just gonna love it. It's the perfect thing, don't you think?"
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"EMILY: You've got to admit, it turned out better than you thought it would."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"EMILY: Well, come on, say a little more than that."
"LORELAI: It's great Mom, it's fabulous. It's just a notch below Rembrandt."
"EMILY: Well, you don't have to take that attitude."
"LORELAI: What do you want from me? I'd light some sparklers and jump up and down yelling 'Yay for the painting' but I'm fresh out of sparklers and my feet hurt too much to jump. But I promise next week when I have more energy, I'll write a love song for the chandelier."
"[Emily leaves the room]"
"RORY: Mom."
"[Lorelai follows Emily]"
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks over to Emily]"
"LORELAI: Hey, how dare you walk away from me when I'm being a world class jerk to you. The painting's great Mom, really."
"EMILY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: I really like it. It's so natural that she's reading which is great, and she's not sitting next to a goose or a giant tortoise, which is good, and Dad is gonna love it. It's a good thing you did here."
"EMILY: You can be so harsh sometimes, and I just don't know where it comes from or what I've done to deserve it."
"LORELAI: You did nothing."
"EMILY: Well, I must've done something."
"LORELAI: Oh, I've been...it's just been a bad week. Sookie and I were moving forward with plans to open our inn, and we had huge fight. And we've never had a huge fight, let alone a fight, and awful things were said and it all started when Mia showed up for a visit and I told her about our plans and she's talking about selling the Independence Inn and it just wigged me out a little. It's stupid, I don't know, but that was our home for so long, mine and Rory's. And it's just weird to think that it wouldn't be there and Mia wouldn't be there and I wouldn't be there, and I just got very upset. Anyway, I'm rambling. The painting's really great. Will you accept my apology?"
"EMILY: Yes, yes I will. I've had bad days too."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"EMILY: Well, we should get back to Rory."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table as Luke walks in.]"
"LUKE: Okay, I'm pretty much done."
"LORELAI: Thanks for doing this. I didn't want the rain to destroy your beautiful chuppah. And I looked and looked in the yellow pages and I didn't see a chuppah waterproofer listing anywhere."
"[Luke holds up a broken wooden goat]"
"LUKE: How about chuppah goat figure repairman?"
"LORELAI: Gilbert."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: The goat. We named him Gilbert, he's headless. Can you fix him?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I got some glue here. I can fix him."
"LORELAI: Good. I'll make some tea."
"LUKE: So, Sookie stopped at the diner this morning."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: I asked her how your plans were going with the new inn, and she very awkwardly changed the subject to women's basketball."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"LUKE: She's never shown much interest in sports before."
"LORELAI: No?"
"LUKE: What's going on with that?"
"LORELAI: Oh well, you know, women's basketball is getting super popular. That's good, I think. The tall girls need an outlet. We had a fight. A big, humongous fight. She's never going to speak to me again."
"LUKE: What happened?"
"LORELAI: I just flat out panicked about the enormity of what we were getting into and it clobbered me, and I clobbered Sookie, and was such a jerk. Hey, if I cry, will it freak you out?"
"LUKE: Totally."
"LORELAI: What if I whimper?"
"LUKE: How about you suck it up?"
"LORELAI: Hmm, I'll try."
"LUKE: I don't get it. You're as ready as you've ever been."
"LORELAI: Oh Luke, do not underestimate the complete and total lack of confidence I have in my abilities."
"LUKE: What? You're the most confident person I know. Obnoxiously so."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: I mean in a good way. You're good at what you do and you know it."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no. I'm good at doing what I have to do. When I had to get a job, I got it. When I had to find a house for us and a life for us, I got it. When I had to get Rory into Chilton, I did it. But I don't have to leave the Independence Inn. I don't have to go into business for myself, I don't have to walk out on that limb and risk everything I've worked for."
"LUKE: Then do it."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Just say where you are."
"LORELAI: What is this, reverse psychology?"
"LUKE: No, just stay at the inn. You're happy there."
"LORELAI: Oh, so you think I can't hack it."
"LUKE: Of course you can hack it."
"LORELAI: Great, lip service, that's what I need."
"LUKE: Hey, if I start to cry, will it freak you out?"
"LORELAI: Ugh. I couldn't stay where I am if I wanted. Mia is selling the inn. And that hit me hard too, maybe harder than the other thing. I'm gonna be without a home."
"LUKE: What do you mean? This is your home."
"LORELAI: No, I mean a home home. A memory home. The inn is where Rory took her first step. It's where I took my first step. It's more of a home to me more than my parents' house ever was."
"LUKE: You're just scared. Just like everybody else when they're taking on something big."
"LORELAI: Well, then what does everybody else do to get through this feeling?"
"LUKE: They run in the back, throw up, pass out and then smack their head on the floor."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: That's what I did on the first morning I opened the diner. Look, there is no button to push to get you through this. You just gotta jump in and be scared and stick with it until it gets fun."
"LORELAI: How long 'til the diner got fun?"
"LUKE: About a year."
"LORELAI: Wow. And there's no button?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: How about a lever, can I pull a lever?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Turn a knob?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: You just jump?"
"LUKE: You just jump."
"LORELAI: I wanna do it."
"LUKE: You should do it. Check it out. [holds up the fixed wooden goat]"
"LORELAI: Gilbert. You're not worse for the wear."
"LUKE: I'll go reattach him. How'd this happen anyway?"
"LORELAI: Oh, something must've smacked into him with a hedger."
"LUKE: Uh huh, well, no one'll ever know. Oh, and uh, women's basketball is in season. You might wanna run that news past Sookie, and maybe you can go to a game or something."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Or something. Thanks."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie is at the stove cooking as Lorelai walks over to her.]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"SOOKIE: Hi."
"LORELAI: Mm. Meat loaf, mashed potatoes, stuffing. Comfort food, huh?"
"SOOKIE: I thought it would be good with the weather changing like this, but if you don't think it's right I can make something else. Although I'm right on schedule and on budget so a change would kinda throw things off. Your call."
"LORELAI: No, no, everything looks great. Hey Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry about what happened. I said stupid things, and I said them for reasons that have nothing to do with you and I hate myself for doing it and I know you do too, and I am sorry."
"SOOKIE: It's okay."
"LORELAI: No it isn't. You are a brilliant chef and to think that you should do things differently from how you do them now is ridiculous. You don't tell a great violinist to hold his bow differently. You don't tell a great cymbal player to crash his cymbals differently. You just let them play."
"SOOKIE: There are great cymbal players?"
"LORELAI: Theoretically."
"SOOKIE: Okay, well, it's okay."
"LORELAI: I wanna go ahead with our plans. Forget my freak out. Pretend it didn't happen. Let's move forward."
"SOOKIE: Well"
"LORELAI: You don't want to move forward?"
"SOOKIE: No, I do. But I need your promise you're not gonna lose it on me again."
"LORELAI: I promise."
"SOOKIE: 'Cause I couldn't take losing a business partner and my best friend in one fail swoop. It'd be too much."
"LORELAI: Sookie, I will place my hand on whatever you want and swear that you can trust that I will not lose confidence in our dream."
"SOOKIE: That's good enough 'cause I know you don't like to put your hand on things."
"LORELAI: We're gonna give it our best sh*t."
"SOOKIE: And if we go down after two years"
"LORELAI: Oh, it'll be the most exciting two years of our lives!"
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[Mia is talking to a man as Emily walks into the inn.]"
"MAN: How about antiques?"
"MIA: Absolutely, it's the best place for antiques. Michel will have a map for you if you need it."
"MAN: Thank you."
"[the man walks away as Mia walks over to Emily]"
"MIA: Hello, can I help you?"
"EMILY: No, thank you. I just"
"MIA: Yes?"
"EMILY: I just wanted to meet the woman who helped raise my daughter."
"MIA: Emily."
"EMILY: Yes, I'm Emily Gilmore."
"MIA: I've wanted to meet you too for a very long time."
"EMILY: Well, that's nice."
"MIA: Would you like to sit down? Or have something to eat? Have lunch with me, won't you?"
"EMILY: No, thank you. You have a lovely place here. It's a beautiful hotel. It's not a home, but still, a beautiful hotel."
"MIA: Sometimes home is where your hat is."
"EMILY: Or where your family is."
"MIA: Yes, that too. You sure you don't want some tea? Tea usually makes things like this a little less awkward. There's things to hold and stir."
"EMILY: I don't know why I came here."
"MIA: You wanted to meet me."
"EMILY: After all these years, it makes no sense."
"MIA: I expected you to come eventually."
"EMILY: Did you?"
"MIA: Mm hmm."
"EMILY: And what did you expect to say to me when I did come?"
"MIA: When Lorelai showed up on my porch that day with a tiny baby in her arms, I thought to myself, what if this were my daughter, and she was cold and scared and needed a place to live? What would I want for her? And then I thought, I'd want her to find somebody to take her in and make her safe and help her find her way."
"EMILY: That's funny. I would've wanted her to find someone who would send her home. I have to go. I'd appreciate if you didn't mention this to Lorelai."
"MIA: I won't."
"[Emily walks to the door, then stops]"
"EMILY: Do you have pictures, from back then?"
"MIA: I'll send you a box full tomorrow."
"EMILY: Thank you."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory sit at a table eating]"
"LORELAI: Oh man, it's such a relief to have that Sookie thing fixed."
"RORY: I know. I hate fighting with friends."
"LORELAI: That's what enemies are for."
"RORY: And God knows we have our share of those."
"LORELAI: People who eat crunchy food with their mouths open."
"RORY: People who dog ear library books."
"LORELAI: People who spit when they talk."
"RORY: Oh gross, you got me in the eye!"
"LORELAI: I did not."
"RORY: You totally did!"
"LORELAI: You're full of it."
"RORY: Luke, where's my toast?"
"LUKE: Ah, it's gonna take awhile. My big toaster's broken so I got stuck with just this dinky one."
"[Jess pushes down the handle on the big toaster, showing Luke that it works]"
"LUKE: How did that happen?"
"JESS: You're gonna break that."
"LUKE: It was broken before."
"JESS: Well it must've got better."
"LUKE: Inanimate objects don't usually get better. Did you fix this?"
"JESS: Please."
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: I have no idea what you're babbling about. I don't fix things."
"LUKE: But yesterday"
"JESS: I got school."
"[Rory smiles at Jess as he leaves]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks in the front door]"
"LORELAI: I'm back!"
"RORY: Kitchen!"
"LORELAI: Mmkay, I couldn't make up my mind so I got 'The Shining' and 'Bringing Up Baby.' Now, I know you're thinking, one's a movie about a homicidal parent and the other one's . . . .hello."
"[Sookie and Rory are standing in front of the kitchen table.]"
"SOOKIE: Hi."
"RORY: Hi Mom."
"LORELAI: What'd you break?"
"SOOKIE: Nothing. Well, the broiler. But this came for you and Max."
"[Sookie and Rory move apart to reveal a gift on the table.]"
"RORY: We're thinking it's a wedding present."
"LORELAI: Huh. Mmm. Lorelai Gilmore and Max Medina. Well, I guess news doesn't always travel fast."
"SOOKIE: You gonna open it?"
"LORELAI: No."
"SOOKIE: But aren't you curious?"
"LORELAI: No. Just leave it there. I'll take it back tomorrow."
"RORY: But there's not a return address."
"LORELAI: Well isn't there a card?"
"RORY: Nope. Maybe there's one inside."
"SOOKIE: With the return address on it."
"RORY: But that means you'd have to open it to find out."
"LORELAI: Fine, give me a knife."
"SOOKIE: Ooh! This is so exciting! Maybe not."
"[Lorelai cuts open the package and they tear the paper off]"
"RORY: An ice cream maker!"
"SOOKIE: A Musso Lussino 480!"
"LORELAI: Somebody sent me a fascist ice cream maker?"
"SOOKIE: Italian design, stainless steel body, chrome finish."
"LORELAI: And no card. Perfect."
"SOOKIE: Jackson just got in his apple crop! We can make cider ice cream!"
"LORELAI: Yes we can, using his ice cream maker, but Il Duce here is going back."
"RORY: To where? Maybe it's an orphan."
"SOOKIE: That's right. We'd be giving it a home."
"LORELAI: Okay, once again, I bring up the fact that this is a wedding present, and as I am not getting married, neither God's law nor Emily Post allows me to keep this."
"RORY: But isn't there a rule about late presents?"
"SOOKIE: Like if it arrives after a certain date, the giver forfeits all rights of return."
"RORY: Exactly."
"LORELAI: Nice try."
"SOOKIE: It's true. I saw it on Martha Stewart. She was doing one of those double programs, and the first half was on massaging your dog, and she had this chow and she was rubbing it"
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: But the second half was about gifts, and she said that if it arrives after ten weeks"
"RORY: Eight."
"SOOKIE: eight weeks, that you don't have to return it."
"LORELAI: Okay, clearly this is shaping up to be one of those moments that St. Peter's gonna show on the big video screen when I die, and I for one do not wanna see the three of us staggering around with cider ice cream slathered all over our faces while my soul hangs in the balance, so until I can find out who sent this, no one goes near it. And we're watching 'The Shining.' [leaves kitchen]"
"SOOKIE: I bet Max would let us keep it."
"OPENING CREDITS"
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"TEACHER: Believe it or not, Shakespeare probably never intended his plays to be read by students sitting at decks more concerned with getting A's than with the fate of Macbeth. His plays were meant to be experienced, lived. So with that in mind, together with my third period Shakespeare, you'll be split up into five groups and each group will assume responsibility for one act of Romeo and Juliet, which will be performed a week from Sunday. You will nominate the director, you will cast the scene, rehearse the scene, and interpret the scene in your own individual manner. Last year, we did Richard the Third. One group did their scene as the Mafiosi. Another set theirs during the Roman Empire. And my favorite, the climactic last scene was set during the final days of the Sonny and Cher show. Just remember, whatever interpretation you choose should highlight the themes you see in the scene. And if the love of the Bard's language still doesn't inspire you, remember this will be fifty percent of your final grade."
"MADELINE: Act five."
"LOUISE: Act five."
"PARIS: Act five?"
"RORY: Act five."
"PARIS: Why don't they just sew our sides together and rename us Chang and Eng?"
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"HENRY: Rory."
"RORY: Henry, hi."
"HENRY: Hey. Act three, sword fight. You?"
"RORY: Oh, Act five, death scene."
"HENRY: Nice. So, uh, tonight, 8 o'clock?"
"RORY: I'll tell Lane."
"[Paris walks up to them]"
"PARIS: Rory, sorry to interrupt. Hi Henry. But see, we're all standing over there trying to map out a game plan and a rehearsal schedule, and I'm sure whatever the two of you are talking about over here is so much more fascinating and important and, well gosh, let's just say it, fun. But I'd really like to get an 'A' on this assignment, and in order to do that I'm afraid you're gonna have to discuss your sock hops and your clambakes some other time, okay? Thanks. [walks away]"
"HENRY: That was scary."
"RORY: It's gonna be a lot scarier when she gets an megaphone in her hands."
"[cut down the hallway to Paris, Madeline and Louise. Rory walks over to them]"
"PARIS: So, I say we meet in the cafeteria. The acoustics are very similar to the Grand Hall, and. . . oh, well look who showed up."
"RORY: Sorry."
"PARIS: Save it."
"LOUISE: Well, well, well. Look who's back from suspension."
"RORY: Tristin got suspended again?"
"PARIS: Oh, like you hadn't noticed he'd been gone?"
"RORY: What did he do?"
"MADELINE: Took apart Mr. McCaffey's car and put it back together in the science building hallway."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LOUISE: Yeah, well he didn't do it by himself. Duncan and Bowman were there too."
"MADELINE: Plus the mechanics that they paid to do the actual work."
"PARIS: Hey, anyone stupid enough to hand out with Butch Cassidy and the Sun-dunce kid deserves whatever they get."
"RORY: How did he fall in with those guys?"
"MADELINE: The new year started and there they were, all three of them, side by side."
"LOUISE: And practically dressing the same."
"MADELINE: It's very On the Town."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is on the couch talking on the phone.]"
"LORELAI: Aunt Bobby, hi. It's Lorelai, Richard and Emily's girl. Um, I'm the one with. . . yeah, that's right. Wow, you don't hear the word wedlock much anymore."
"RORY: I'm home!"
"LORELAI: Uh huh, uh huh, really? The Bible said all that, huh? Did it, did it mention me by name? I'm just. . .okay, I'm just kidding. So, um, judging by your Billy Graham impression, I am guessing that you didn't send me an ice cream maker, so maybe you could just give me Aunt Clarissa's phone number? Oh no, I hadn't heard. That's terrible. Uh huh. Well, then I guess she had it coming, didn't she? Hey, listen, I'd love to chat about who else is the family is currently or soon to be headed for hell, but I've gotta run, so I promise to call in the next twenty years, okay? Bye bye. [hangs up] How scary is it that my parents are turning our to be the normal ones in the family?"
"RORY: No luck?"
"LORELAI: Well, I still have the, uh, Pennsylvania Gilmores, but how was your day?"
"RORY: I have to perform Act Five of Romeo and Juliet with Paris, Madeline, and Louise."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: Paris has appointed herself as director."
"LORELAI: Nice. What part are you playing?"
"RORY: I don't know yet. She's still mulling over the screen tests right now. We're gonna find out tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Screen tests?"
"RORY: 24 takes."
"LORELAI: Ah, I so want a copy."
"RORY: Forget it."
"LORELAI: Sell it on the Internet, make a fortune. First we brought you Pamela and Tommy Lee, now prepare yourselves for the crazy antics of Rory and the Bard!"
"RORY: Oh, and I told Paris that you would make all of our costumes so she wants to have a concept meeting with you tomorrow at three."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Yeah, she needs a resume and samples of your previous work and, uh, referrals."
"LORELAI: And my bare butt to kiss."
"RORY: If you think that will set you apart from the other applicants, yes. Hey, I didn't know that there was someone in our family named Bunny."
"LORELAI: Oh, cross her off the list."
"RORY: Poor Bunny. [phone rings] Hello?"
"HENRY: Hey."
"RORY: Henry, hi."
"HENRY: Am I late?"
"RORY: No, right on time. Hold on."
"LORELAI: Hey hon, I'm heading for class. There's pizza-slash-Luke's money on the table for dinner."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[Rory puts Henry on hold and calls Lane; at Lane's house, Mrs. Kim answers the phone]"
"MRS. KIM: Kim's Antiques."
"RORY: Hello Mrs. Kim, this is Rory. May I please speak with Lane?"
"MRS. KIM: Lane is studying."
"LANE: Wait, Mama. Mama, is that for me?"
"MRS. KIM: Why?"
"LANE: Well, I was just expecting a call from Rory and I thought. . ."
"MRS. KIM: You do your math?"
"LANE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: History?"
"LANE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: Biology?"
"LANE: No."
"MRS. KIM: Why?"
"LANE: Well, I'm not taking biology."
"MRS. KIM: Why?"
"LANE: I took it last year."
"MRS. KIM: And that's it? One year and you know all there is to know."
"LANE: Well, I. . ."
"MRS. KIM: Tomorrow we look into private school."
"LANE: Mama, please, the phone."
"MRS. KIM: Five minutes. I'm counting."
"LANE: Hello?"
"RORY: Lane. Hold on. Henry?"
"HENRY: Here."
"RORY: Lane?"
"LANE: Here."
"RORY: Okay guys, talk to you later. [hangs up]"
"LANE: So, Rory, how are you?"
"HENRY: I'm good, how are you doing?"
"[back at Lorelai's house]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm gone. Hey, um, do me a favor, make some of those calls for me."
"RORY: Don't you think you may be going a little far with this?"
"LORELAI: What do you mean?"
"RORY: I mean, I understand that you wanna return the ice cream maker, but you did make an honest effort to get in touch with the person that sent this to you, and. . ."
"LORELAI: It's called closure, hon. I need it, okay?"
"RORY: Okay. Uncle Randolph. Oh, sorry guys. They'll be off in a sec."
"LORELAI: Okay, don't wait too long. I think Randolph was Bunny's older brother."
"RORY: Got it."
"CUT TO BUSINESS CLASS"
"[Lorelai gets a burrito from the vending machine in the break room. A man walks over to her.]"
"PAUL: One again, ladies and gentlemen, she takes the last burrito."
"LORELAI: And hello to you too."
"PAUL: Week after week, how do you do it?"
"LORELAI: I told you, correct change. You go in for that dollar bill nonsense, you'll be standing there for ten minutes watching it. Ehhh. Eh eh eh."
"PAUL: And here I thought you had a special relationship with this vending machine."
"LORELAI: Only in the sense that it keeps me alive."
"PAUL: I actually have theory on that."
"LORELAI: Uh oh."
"PAUL: You know, ever since we were children, we got our nourishment from our mothers."
"LORELAI: Okay, are you trying to gross me out so I can't eat my burrito?"
"PAUL: And now, we're getting it from machines."
"LORELAI: Your point being?"
"PAUL: I think it's a conspiracy getting us ready for the day we're all gonna be raised by machines. No human contact whatsoever."
"LORELAI: You know my mother, don't you?"
"PAUL: The, uh, Twilight Zone marathon was on all week."
"LORELAI: So all of this is a way of saying you wanna look at my notes on the reading."
"PAUL: Such perception."
"LORELAI: And in one so young and beautiful. Frightening, isn't it?"
"PAUL: You know, I feel bad about doing this every week."
"LORELAI: Really? I would've thought you would've gotten used to it by now."
"PAUL: Come on Lorelai. I gotta pay you back somehow. How about you let me take you out to dinner one night?"
"LORELAI: Dinner?"
"PAUL: Yeah, maybe even somewhere that doesn't require correct change, unless you're firmly into the whole coin thing, then I know a good automat."
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know."
"PAUL: Well, I was kidding about the whole automat."
"LORELAI: No, an automat's fine. Um, it's just, uh, my schedule's kinda crazy for the next couple weeks."
"PAUL: Okay. Well, it's just a thought. But if you suddenly get an opening, give me a call. [hands her a business card]"
"LORELAI: Oh, great, sure, thanks. Enjoy the notes."
"PAUL: Thank you. Enjoy the burrito."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Rory walks over to the table where Madeline, Louise, and a boy are sitting.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"MADELINE: Hey."
"LOUISE: We're the Monkees."
"RORY: Where's Paris?"
"MADELINE: She'll be here in a minute. She said she had to get some things."
"RORY: [to boy] Hi, I'm Rory."
"BRAD: I'm Brad. From the third period Shakespeare."
"LOUISE: He's the answer to our lack of boys problem. Isn't that swell?"
"RORY: Well, maybe we should start."
"MADELINE: Without Paris?"
"LOUISE: Ooh, that could be lethal."
"RORY: We could at least decide on what motif we want to do."
"[Paris walks in carrying a box]"
"PARIS: We're doing traditional Elizabethan."
"RORY: Elizabethan? But I thought the point of this was to . . ."
"PARIS: The point is to get an A, not to make Romeo and Juliet into a Vegas lounge act. Besides, we have the death scene. It's classic, it's famous. Who are you?"
"BRAD: I'm, uh, Brad. From the third period Shakespeare, ma'am."
"PARIS: Okay. Now I want everyone to read the chapters on acting I photocopied out of Houseman's Memoirs tonight. Everyone will be off book by Friday, and if you plan on missing rehearsal, you better bring a coroner's note."
"[Paris places a sword on the table]"
"RORY: Tell me you didn't just have that lying around."
"PARIS: We're short on boys. That makes you Romeo. Louise, you can play the Friar."
"LOUISE: Excuse me?"
"[Tristin walks in and sits down at their table]"
"TRISTIN: Well, well, the gang's all here."
"PARIS: This is a meeting."
"TRISTIN: Yeah, sorry I'm late."
"PARIS: What do you think you're doing?"
"TRISTIN: Uh, Professor Anderson forgot to include me when she made up the groups, so she told me to pick one."
"PARIS: Fine, you have four other acts to choose from. Take your pick."
"TRISTIN: Yeah, well Summer's in act 1, Beth and Jessica are in act 2, Kate's in act 3, and uh, Claire, Kathy, and Mary are in act 4. So this is the only one free of ex-girlfriends."
"PARIS: So we're being punished for our good taste?"
"TRISTIN: Oh, Paris, you hurt me. Do you no longer have any need for me at all?"
"LOUISE: Yes, we have great need. You can be our Romeo."
"RORY: Brad is Romeo!"
"LOUISE: Put in your other contact Grandma. Tristin is Romeo. Brad can be the second guard on the left."
"PARIS: No."
"MADELINE: She's kinda right, Paris. Tristin was born to be Romeo."
"PARIS: Hey, I'm the director and I'll decide who's born to be what, and Brad is Romeo."
"LOUISE: Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."
"PARIS: What'd you say?"
"LOUISE: Just perhaps that someone is letting her personal feeling interfere with her leadership."
"PARIS: My only feeling is that I don't wanna give the most important part to someone who can't even manage to stay in school."
"LOUISE: I'm just gonna say one thing: fifty percent of our final grade."
"TRISTIN: Is there gonna be any scratching involved, or is this just a verbal thing?"
"PARIS: What do you think about this?"
"RORY: Well, how are you at speaking in front of a lot of people?"
"BRAD: I tend to throw up."
"PARIS: Fine, but I swear, you flake on this and you'll pray you get suspended."
"TRISTIN: I gotta run. Are we done here?"
"PARIS: Rehearsal, tomorrow night."
"LOUISE: Good. So now Brad can be Friar Tuck and I can be Juliet."
"PARIS: Wrong."
"LOUISE: Hey."
"PARIS: Juliet's supposed to be chaste."
"LOUISE: Oh."
"MADELINE: Then . . ."
"PARIS: And she has more than three lines."
"MADELINE: Oh."
"RORY: Oh no."
"PARIS: Too late."
"RORY: It can't be too late, we haven't done anything yet."
"PARIS: You're Juliet. You're the best public speaker here, you've definitely got that waif thing down, and you'll look great dead. Next order of business. I did some location scouting this morning, and I think the courtyard outside. . . ."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie carries a plate of pancakes over to Michel]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, here we go. Low fat, whole wheat blueberry pancakes."
"MICHEL: Are there twelve?"
"SOOKIE: Twelve what?"
"MICHEL: Blueberries. I can only have twelve blueberries for breakfast."
"SOOKIE: Or what?"
"MICHEL: What do you mean, or what?"
"SOOKIE: What happens if you eat thirteen blueberries?"
"MICHEL: Well this is a silly conversation."
"SOOKIE: Would you die?"
"MICHEL: Just hand me the plate."
"SOOKIE: Only if you don't count."
"MICHEL: I won't count."
"SOOKIE: Swear. Raise your right hand and say, 'May Destiny's Child break up if I count these blueberries.'"
"MICHEL: Pick another group."
"SOOKIE: Nope."
"MICHEL: I hate you! Hate you!"
"[Michel walks out of the kitchen as Lorelai carries the ice cream maker in and puts it on the counter]"
"LORELAI: Wow, I gotta start getting in earlier."
"SOOKIE: Hey, I remember you."
"LORELAI: I am donating it to the inn."
"SOOKIE: Well, honey, that's very thoughtful."
"LORELAI: Yes it is."
"SOOKIE: But we have an ice cream maker, a professional one. See, that means we can make enough ice cream for everyone in the inn, whereas this little guy"
"LORELAI: Fernando."
"SOOKIE: Fernando, try as he might, can only make enough ice cream for, well, you, so . . ."
"LORELAI: So we don't need him here?"
"SOOKIE: No, we don't."
"LORELAI: Well can't you find some use for him? I mean, he's new and shiny, and it's not his fault that he's part of the other life that I almost had but don't have now, and kinda don't wanna be reminded of."
"SOOKIE: I guess I could put my change in him."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"SOOKIE: Honey, can I say something?"
"LORELAI: sh**t."
"SOOKIE: I'm a little concerned about you."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"SOOKIE: You just seem very emotional about this ice cream maker."
"LORELAI: I am not."
"SOOKIE: You named the ice cream maker."
"LORELAI: I name everything."
"SOOKIE: You didn't name the toaster."
"LORELAI: Poppy."
"SOOKIE: You just made that up."
"LORELAI: I did not. All right, but admit it, Poppy is a damn good name for a toaster."
"SOOKIE: It's been quite awhile since you and Max have broken up"
"LORELAI: I'm fine Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Okay, you're fine. But are you moving on?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm moving on."
"SOOKIE: Well, then how many dates have you had post-Max?"
"LORELAI: What does that have to do with anything?"
"SOOKIE: I just feel like you're hibernating."
"LORELAI: I'm not hibernating."
"SOOKIE: Yes you are."
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, woo. Look at this skirt, huh? I'm not hibernating."
"SOOKIE: Then how many dates have you been on?"
"LORELAI: I was engaged Sookie, you don't just get over that."
"SOOKIE: But you went through your mourning period."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: And you said it was over."
"LORELAI: It was. . .is."
"SOOKIE: Well, are you at least putting the vibe out there so they'll know you're available?"
"LORELAI: Okay, look, if it'll make you feel any better, okay, I just got asked out the other night."
"SOOKIE: What? You're kidding! Who is he?"
"LORELAI: Some guy from my business class."
"SOOKIE: Oh, business class."
"LORELAI: He's a pretty cool guy, actually. He's cute, funny, and, um, he's a little younger, but, uh, he's very sharp. You know, we have this little bit going about me stealing his burrito."
"SOOKIE: Oh, stealing his burrito. You kids!"
"LORELAI: No, like a real burrito."
"SOOKIE: Oh, stolen his burrito."
"LORELAI: Okay, forget the burrito Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Fine. When you guys going out?"
"LORELAI: Well, I didn't exactly say yes."
"SOOKIE: Why not? You've already got the skirt."
"LORELAI: Because, I don't know, what if it doesn't work out? And then class will be weird, and it'll definitely screw up our burrito bit."
"SOOKIE: Aw honey, come on, every guy doesn't have to be the guy."
"LORELAI: I don't know. Isn't it too soon for the transition guy?"
"SOOKIE: Don't think of him as the transition guy. Think of him as the pre-transition guy."
"LORELAI: A pre-transition guy? You're allowed that?"
"SOOKIE: Absolutely."
"LORELAI: Wow, I gotta read the rulebook more carefully."
"SOOKIE: So?"
"LORELAI: So. . . I will call him later tonight."
"SOOKIE: Great! That's so great!"
"[Michel comes in and tries to take the pancakes. Sookie grabs his arm.]"
"SOOKIE: It's all or nothing Sparky."
"MICHEL: Damn you!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai sits at the kitchen table sewing the costumes while Rory walks into the living room talking to Lane on the phone.]"
"RORY: She's letting you go? That's amazing. What changed her mind?"
"LANE: I let her watch the Romeo and Juliet movie with Leo and Claire Danes."
"RORY: Really? I would've thought she'd hated it."
"LANE: Oh, she did. But trust my mom to turn one of the world's great love stories into a cautionary tale of what happens when children disobey their parents."
"RORY: So I'm guessing that you're not any closer to telling your parents about Henry."
"LANE: I mean, what are the options if I tell them? They hate him, and it's over. They love him, and he therefore becomes odious to me and it's over. Things are working out fine the way they are."
"RORY: You mean calling him Rory on the phone in case your mom's listening?"
"LANE: I've grown fond of my cage Rory."
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: Bye."
"RORY: Bye. [hangs up]"
"[Lorelai walks into the living room wearing the Juliet headpiece.]"
"LORELAI: What dost my lady think?"
"RORY: That you're going to be late for the joust?"
"LORELAI: I meant of thy lovely headdress crafted by thy mother's hand artful hand?"
"RORY: It pleaseth me mucheth, but uh, hath my beautius mother lookedeth at the time?"
"LORELAI: Oh crap!"
"[Lorelai runs upstairs as the phone rings; Rory answers]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"PARIS: Two other groups are rehearsing at school in the Grand Hall even though I specifically reserved it for us way in advance and confirmed the reservation twice, but whatever. They're going to be there and I don't want them spying on us."
"RORY: I don't think the ending to Romeo and Juliet is exactly a secret."
"PARIS: Hello, our interpretation?"
"RORY: Oh right."
"PARIS: I went on the web and I found a site called MissPatty.net. It's in your town."
"RORY: There's a MissPatty.net?"
"PARIS: Have you heard of it?"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"PARIS: Is it big enough? The site says it's 720 square feet."
"RORY: You know, I'd rather just rehearse somewhere else."
"PARIS: Look, I've got enough to worry about without you being embarrassed of where you live."
"RORY: I'm not embarrassed. I just want to keep my school life separate from my home life, you know?"
"PARIS: Tough. Madeline and Louise are already on their way. See you in half an hour."
"[Rory hangs up as Lorelai comes down the steps]"
"LORELAI: Have you seen my bag with the beads and the fur, kind of looks like Stalin's head? Aha."
"RORY: We're rehearsing here now."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Our Shakespeare group. Paris didn't want anyone spying on us so now we're rehearsing in Stars Hollow. This sucks."
"LORELAI: Well, at least you don't have to drive to Hartford. What's with the face?"
"RORY: It's just, Tristin is in our group."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, you told me."
"RORY: Right, so Tristin, he's in our group, so that means he's inwell, and Dean lives here, so this sucks."
"LORELAI: Okay, you know what Vanna? I'm gonna need a few more vowels here."
"RORY: I have to tell him."
"LORELAI: Tell who?"
"RORY: Dean?"
"LORELAI: Tell Dean what?"
"RORY: That Tristin and I. . .that we kissed at that stupid party."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: I have no choice."
"LORELAI: Well"
"RORY: Because if Tristin sees Dean, he's gonna tell him. And then it's gonna be worse because it's gonna be like I was keeping it from him."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's just calm down now."
"RORY: Which I was. I was keeping it from him. I can't believe this, now I have to tell him."
"LORELAI: You're right."
"RORY: I am?"
"LORELAI: Mm hmm. I think you should tell him."
"RORY: Of course, right, I have to."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Then at the play, right as Tristin enters to find you dead and pulls out the vial of poison to k*ll himself, Dean can leap from the audience and rip his head off, adding a level of reality few productions have ever seen before. You'll get an A. The Actors Studio will go nuts. You'll have James Lipton asking you what your favorite swear word is. It's a great plan."
"RORY: You - not helping."
"LORELAI: To prevent a homicide? Yes I am."
"RORY: I have to tell him. I don't have a choice."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine. Try it out on me first."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Pretend I'm Dean. If you're going to tell him this, you'd better have down what you're going to say."
"RORY: Seriously?"
"LORELAI: Seriously."
"RORY: Okay. Dean."
"LORELAI: Rory. Sorry, serious now."
"RORY: Okay, Dean, remember last year when we had broken up, and we weren't together anymore because we had broken up"
"LORELAI: That's good, mention it three times. Keep going."
"RORY: And uh, there was this party, and I went, and, um, Tristin was there. And somehow, I'm not really sure how, we ended up in a room together, and we kissed."
"LORELAI: You and Tristin?"
"RORY: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: On the hand?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Cheek?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: He kissed you or you kissed him?"
"RORY: Kind of both."
"LORELAI: So you kissed him?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: When?"
"RORY: I already told you three times, when we were broken up!"
"LORELAI: Okay, not a good idea to yell at him right now."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: When during the breakup?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I mean, how long after we broke up did you kiss Tristin?"
"RORY: Uhh, just the night after we broke up."
"LORELAI: You mean the night after I told you I loved you?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: The next night, after I told you I loved you, you kissed Tristin?"
"RORY: I'm a terrible person!"
"LORELAI: Hold on."
"RORY: He's absolutely right. He told me he loved me and the next night I go and I kiss Tristin."
"LORELAI: Hey, that was me, not Dean."
"RORY: I hate myself."
"LORELAI: You didn't do anything wrong. You were hurt and confused and broken up. You did nothing wrong."
"RORY: Tell that to Dean."
"LORELAI: No, because we're not telling Dean anything."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Listen to me. I know you are Miss Honesty. I have seen the banner in the closet. But this is the kind of honesty that will only make you feel less guilty, and it's going to hurt Dean very much. It's possibly going to screw up the really good thing you guys have going now. Do you want that?"
"RORY: No, I don't."
"LORELAI: All right then. Relax. Be calm. Everything will be fine."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: I gotta go. Can I ask you one more question? Do you think my hair looks cool?"
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: 'Cause, you know, some days I wake up and I'm like, cool. Some days I'm like, could be cooler."
"RORY: I won't wait up for you."
"LORELAI: Like today I got up and I was like, left side cool, right side not so cool."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO"
"[Miss Patty instructs several older people who lay on mats on the floor]"
"MISS PATTY: Just listen to your breathing and let the world melt away. And in, and out. And in, and out."
"[Paris walks in]"
"PARIS: Excuse me. We reserved this place for 8 sharp and right now my watch says 8:04."
"MISS PATTY: Well, then tell it to go outside and have a smoke. You can't rush a cool down sweetheart."
"PARIS: Look, I understand the whole Mystic Pizza, small town, 'we don't let a clock run our lives' thing, but I come from the big city where money talks and I'm paying good money for this place and I have a schedule to keep."
"MISS PATTY: Be careful darling, or your face is gonna freeze like that."
"[Rory, Louise, Madeline, and Brad walk in]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LOUISE: What's with the cast from Cocoon?"
"PARIS: Where's Tristin? He said he was coming with you."
"MADELINE: Oh, he's here. He just went over to the market."
"RORY: What?"
"LOUISE: He needed cigarettes, just in case we didn't already know that he was bad."
"RORY: Umm, I'll be right back."
"PARIS: Where are you going?"
"RORY: I'll just be a sec. [leaves]"
"PARIS: Okay, now they're just sleeping."
"CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Dean is stocking shelves as Tristin walks over to him.]"
"TRISTIN: Excuse me stockboy, could you tell me where I can find the shortneing? Now that is a fine looking apron. I mean it, I mean, really sensational."
"DEAN: What are you doing here?"
"TRISTIN: Well, to be honest, there's something I wanted to ask you. [picks up two bags of flour] In your professional opinion, which one of these would make my cakes fluffier?"
"DEAN: You drove all the way out here just to be a jerk. There aren't enough people who can't stand you in Hartford."
"TRISTIN: Oh, no. I'm here for Rory."
"DEAN: What?"
"TRISTIN: Yeah, the play. Romeo and Juliet."
"DEAN: What about it?"
"TRISTIN: I'm Romeo, and she's Juliet. Hey, come on, she must've told you. She did tell you, didn't she?"
"DEAN: Look, I think you better leave."
"[Tristin drops a bag of flour on the floor]"
"TRISTIN: Oops! God I am so sorry. I am such a klutz. Here, let me. This should cover it. [drops some money on the floor]"
"DEAN: You know what, I hope for Rory's sake that you got an understudy."
"[Rory runs up to them]"
"RORY: Dean, hi!"
"DEAN: Rory, what is he doing here?"
"RORY: I need to talk to you."
"DEAN: I got something to settle with this guy."
"RORY: Outside, please."
""
""
""
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Dean walk out of the market]"
"DEAN: All right, I'm outside."
"RORY: I'm really sorry I didn't tell you about this before, but Tristin"
"DEAN: Is playing Romeo to your Juliet. Yeah, I heard."
"RORY: But he wasn't even in our group at first, but then no one else wanted him, and then Paris moved the rehearsal spot to here, and she did it today and I didn't have time to tell you."
"DEAN: You and Tristin wind up thrown together a lot at that school."
"RORY: It's just a project, that's all, nothing more."
"DEAN: You and Tristin playing Romeo and Juliet. Perfect. Really, really amazing."
"RORY: I know you hate it."
"DEAN: Yeah, I hate it. I really hate it."
"RORY: But we do the scene on Sunday, and then it's over. And it's back to, Tristin? Who? I don't ... I don't know Tristin."
"DEAN: You must mean that young boy who got mysteriously strangled by a Doose's market apron one night."
"RORY: I heard about that. Awful. They say drugs were involved. Please don't be mad. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry."
"DEAN: Sorry about what? You didn't. . .you didn't choose to do this with him, right?"
"RORY: No, I didn't."
"DEAN: Then what do you have to be sorry for?"
"RORY: That. . .that I didn't tell you about the rehearsal. And that No Doubt is touring with U2. I know you're extremely disappointed in Bono."
"DEAN: All right, so, so when's this thing over?"
"RORY: Sunday."
"DEAN: Okay. I'm gonna walk around the block, just get him out of the market."
"RORY: Right away."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory is sitting at a table eating as Lorelai walks in and sits with her.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, thank goodness, you ordered. I am starving."
"RORY: What are you doing here? I thought you went out to dinner."
"LORELAI: Well, I did go out to dinner."
"RORY: Then why are you eating mine?"
"LORELAI: Well, he took me to this darling little place called Minnie's. Very hip, very chic, very small portions."
"RORY: So how'd it go?"
"LORELAI: Well"
"RORY: Aww."
"LORELAI: You know, we talked about all the things we had in common and then the salad came."
"RORY: Not a soulmate?"
"LORELAI: He's never seen Ab Fab."
"RORY: Definitely not a soulmate."
"LORELAI: Plus, he's outdoorsy. Remember that Meryl Streep movie where she and her family take a rafting trip and then psycho Kevin Bacon forces them to take 'em down the river?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Okay, that's his dream vacation, minus Kevin Bacon."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Whereas mine is Kevin Bacon, minus the river, so..."
"RORY: Hey, moving on."
"LORELAI: Yeah. But I must say, I'm really glad I went tonight."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I mean, it was fun to kinda get dressed up and have a freshly laundered man open the door for me. And the best part about it was, it was no big deal. I mean, we laughed a little, we hugged goodnight, I'll never date him again, but I do believe the burrito bit will live on. It was a totally casual date. I am now officially a casual dater."
"RORY: That's great. And we can celebrate by getting you your own plate of fries."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"RORY: Hey Luke, can we get another round?"
"LUKE: Coming right up."
"LORELAI: So tell me about the big rehearsal."
"RORY: We got off to a shaky start, and Louise acts like she's the priest in a Madonna video, but by the end, we were not half bad."
"LORELAI: Good good."
"RORY: Tristin ran into Dean."
"LORELAI: Ugh, bad bad."
"RORY: It's okay though because I pulled them apart without any bloodshed and I explained it all to Dean."
"LORELAI: You explained it all to Dean?"
"RORY: I told him that Tristin wasn't supposed to be in our group and Paris moved the rehearsal to Miss Patty's at the last minute and that's why he didn't know about it."
"LORELAI: Oh, that version of all."
"RORY: But Dean's fine now."
"LORELAI: He's fine?"
"RORY: He's fine."
"LUKE: You want a burger too?"
"LORELAI: Hmm, no, I'll just have half of hers."
"RORY: One burger please."
"LUKE: You look all dressed up."
"LORELAI: Do I? Because I feel very casual."
"[Dean walks into the diner and sits down with them]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hi, you just got off work?"
"DEAN: Yup."
"LORELAI: Hey Dean. Do you want some fries?"
"DEAN: No, I'm actually going home for dinner. My mom made fried chicken tonight and she saved me some."
"LORELAI: Oh, you have a cooking mom."
"RORY: That's so nice."
"LORELAI: Well, she may make chicken, but is she a casual dater?"
"RORY: I hope not. She's married."
"DEAN: Do I wanna know what either one of you is talking about?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"RORY: My mother casually dated tonight."
"DEAN: Oh, well, congratulations."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Thank you very much."
"DEAN: So, I was wondering what time your rehearsal was tomorrow?"
"RORY: Five, why?"
"DEAN: Well, uh, it's my night off and I thought maybe I'd come by and watch."
"RORY: Watch what?"
"DEAN: Watch you."
"RORY: Watch me do what?"
"DEAN: Rehearse."
"RORY: Oh. Um, Dean, I think you'd be really bored watching rehearsal."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, I've dozed off twice just listening to her talk about rehearsal."
"DEAN: Well, I won't be bored."
"RORY: We don't even know our lines yet. You should just come on Sunday."
"LORELAI: That's a good idea. After all, Sunday is the day of rest and that's what you'll be doing - resting, 'cause it's boring."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Well, honey, it's not your fault. You didn't write the damn thing."
"DEAN: Well, I'll come on Sunday too."
"RORY: Okay. But if you're gonna go on Sunday, you don't want to spoil it for yourself."
"DEAN: What? It's not like I don't know how it ends."
"RORY: Okay, Dean, look"
"DEAN: Rory, come on. I'll sit in the back, you'll die, and I'll walk you home. It's no big deal, right?"
"RORY: Right."
"DEAN: Good, so I'll see you tomorrow."
"RORY: Yup, you sure will."
"DEAN: Bye Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Bye Dean. [Dean leaves] Oh yeah, he's fine."
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory walks up to Tristin and his friends]"
"RORY: Excuse me Tristin, can I talk to you for a second?"
"TRISTIN: [to his friends] I'll meet you guys later, okay? [they walk away] I'm all yours."
"RORY: I need to talk to you about something serious."
"TRISTIN: Serious, huh? I'm intrigued."
"RORY: Dean's coming to rehearsal tonight."
"TRISTIN: Wow, are you sure they can spare him? I mean, what if there's a run on baked beans?"
"RORY: Can you just shut up for five seconds, please? Thank you. Look, as I said, Dean is coming to rehearsal tonight, and I'd like to ask you to promise that you won't say anything to him about what happened."
"TRISTIN: What happened?"
"RORY: At the party?"
"TRISTIN: At the party?"
"RORY: Tristin! You and me, at Madeline's party? You had just been kicked to the curb by Summer, and I found you sulking on a piano bench, and I sat down, we talked, and thenwe kissed."
"TRISTIN: That was you?"
"RORY: You know what, forget it."
"TRISTIN: Hey, Rory."
"RORY: There is no point in talking to you. I knew that, yet I tried. Won't happen again."
"TRISTIN: You don't want me to tell Dean that we kissed."
"RORY: By George, I think he's got it."
"TRISTIN: Okay, if that's what you want."
"RORY: It is."
"TRISTIN: Although, he's gonna find out anyway."
"RORY: What?"
"TRISTIN: Well, come on, you know that when we kiss on stage, it's gonna be pretty obvious that it's not the first time. I'm a good actor, but I can't hide that kind of passion."
"RORY: Look, things are really good for me and Dean right now, and I don't want anything to mess that up. Especially not something that meant nothing at all to me and I wished had never happened in the first place."
"TRISTIN: So things are going good for you too, huh?"
"RORY: Yeah, they are."
"TRISTIN: Good, that's good."
"RORY: So what do you think? You just took those out."
"TRISTIN: Well, I changed my mind."
"RORY: Are you all right?"
"TRISTIN: Yeah, I think somehow I'll recover from the great romance between you and the Beave."
"RORY: A lot of stuff's been going on with you lately, huh?"
"TRISTIN: Meaning?"
"RORY: Just, you know, the car thing, the suspension thing, a lot of drama."
"TRISTIN: Well I get bored easily."
"RORY: Just doesn't really seem like you."
"TRISTIN: And you know me now?"
"RORY: I know you don't get suspended for stupid pranks."
"TRISTIN: I pulled stuff like that before I knew Duncan and Bowman, all right?"
"RORY: Well, if you did, you didn't get caught. You're getting caught a lot."
"TRISTIN: Your point being?"
"RORY: Maybe Duncan and Bowman aren't the best people to be hanging out with. They're not as smart as you Tristin, they don't have what you have going for you. They"
"TRISTIN: You know, I'm gonna have to bail before we get to the whole hugging part. And ask your boyfriend to remind me when it's coupon day, okay?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory sit at the counter.]"
"LORELAI: Taking pity on your burger?"
"RORY: Not hungry."
"LORELAI: Honey, you've got to eat. You're gonna k*ll yourself in a couple of hours, you really need your strength."
"RORY: Ha ha."
"LORELAI: Maybe Dean won't even come tonight."
"RORY: Oh, he'll be there. There aren't enough monster truck rallies in the world to keep him away from Miss Patty's tonight."
"[Paul and his parents walk into the diner]"
"LORELAI: All right, that's it. This afternoon we are going to engage in some intensive retail therapy to bring you out of this funk."
"RORY: No thanks."
"LORELAI: I mean it. Today is the day we finally spring for the Powerpuff girl shotglasses."
"RORY: Hmm, I can't. I promised Lane I'd help her pick out an outfit for the play tomorrow."
"PAUL: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"PAUL: Hey, it is you. This is Lorelai, she's the girl I told you about."
"LORELAI: Oh, Paul. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you with the hat."
"PAUL: Yeah."
"LORELAI: What are you doing here?"
"PAUL: Well, um, getting some coffee."
"LORELAI: In Stars Hollow?"
"PAUL: Well, you know, you talked so much about the town the other night and especially Luke's place, so my mom's crazy for coffee, I thought I'd bring 'em up here for breakfast."
"RORY: [quietly] The other night?"
"LORELAI: [quietly] Uh, yes. Paul's my friend from the other night, the uh, casual Wednesday."
"RORY: Oh."
"LORELAI: Oh, Paul, I want you to meet my daughter Rory."
"PAUL: Hi, nice to meet you. Hey, these are my parents, Dorie and Sid."
"DORIE: Nice to meet you."
"SID: Pleasure, really."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, me too."
"LUKE: You ordering?"
"PAUL: Luke. Are you Luke? Is this Luke?"
"LORELAI: Yes, that's Luke."
"PAUL: Oh man! Mom, Dad, that is Luke."
"DORIE: We've heard so much about you."
"SID: Darn shame about that Rachel."
"LUKE: Who the hell are these people?"
"LORELAI; Uh, Paul is my friend from business school."
"PAUL: Yeah, we went out the other night. And uh, you know, she talked about a few people in this town, and you being one of 'em, so nice to meet you."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"PAUL: Um, okay, three coffees to go then."
"LORELAI: [to Rory] Something funny?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: You're just smiling for no reason?"
"RORY: I'm a happy person."
"PAUL: Hey, I've gotta run. Mom wants to go antiquing, so it was nice meeting you, and uh, I'll see you in class Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Bye. Bye now. Bye."
"[Paul and his parents leave]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: Say it!"
"RORY: I've always wanted a little brother."
"LORELAI: He looked older the other night!"
"RORY: How much older could he possibly look?"
"LORELAI: A lot! He's usually a little scruffy, and then the baseball cap hides the funky hair thing."
"RORY: He should've been holding a yo-yo and a lollipop and wearing a beanie with a propeller on it."
"LORELAI: He's in his twenties."
"RORY: He must have been a very good boy to deserve such a happy day. I bet they let him ride a pony."
"LORELAI: Aren't you supposed to go help Lane?"
"RORY: Thanks for cheering me up."
"[Rory leaves as Luke walks over]"
"LORELAI: What? You wanna say something too?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Please don't hold back on my account."
"LUKE: I wouldn't."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: [to kids at the counter] Would you guys mind moving down a couple stools? Make me more comfortable."
"LORELAI: This is me leaving."
"LUKE: Hey, how do I know what the cutoff is?"
"LORELAI: And no tip, I wonder why."
"LUKE: I mean, at least if you had one of those height bars like at amusement park rides"
"LORELAI: Bye now."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO"
"[Tristin and Rory are rehearsing up front, as Paris, Madeline, Louise, Brad, and Dean watch them.]"
"TRISTIN: Here's to my love. Oh true apothecary, thy drugs are quick. Line?"
"PARIS: Thus with a kiss, I die. How hard is that to remember?"
"TRISTIN: Thus with a kiss, I die. Right. And then I kiss he, right?"
"PARIS: Yes. You say 'Thus with a kiss, I die.' Then you kiss her and die. Why are you smiling? You think this is a joke? The performance is tomorrow."
"TRISTIN: Wait, tomorrow? Oh my God. I totally missed it the first 47 times you said it."
"PARIS: I warned you. I am not going to fail this because of you. I will replace you with Brad in a second."
"BRAD: Oh, dear God, no."
"RORY: Can we just get through the scene?"
"MADELINE: Please."
"PARIS: Fine. But yell line once more and you're out. Start memorizing."
"TRISTIN: Oh true apothecary, thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss, I die."
"PARIS: What?"
"TRISTIN: Well, it's just, with this being our last kiss and all, it makes me think about our first kiss. You know, at the party."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Lie down, you're dead."
"LOUISE: We all are."
"TRISTIN: You remember the kiss. In Act 1 at the Capulet's masked party?"
"PARIS: What about it?"
"TRISTIN: Well, I was just trying to think of something that would make this kiss as special as that one."
"RORY: Tristin."
"TRISTIN: I thought she could cry."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: She's dead. You're dead, lie down."
"TRISTIN: Yeah, but that's the beauty of it. No one would expect her to cry."
"DEAN: I would."
"TRISTIN: You know, funny you should say that"
"RORY: I need to take five."
"PARIS: You know what? Let's all take five. That way you can all cancel whatever plans you had tonight because we are staying here until we get this right."
"[Brad pulls out his cell phone]"
"LOUISE: Who could you possibly be calling?"
"[Rory walks over to Dean]"
"DEAN: He is unbelievable."
"RORY: Dean, I really need you to leave."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: The play is tomorrow, and it's fifty percent of my grade, and you standing there staring at Tristin, it's like a challenge or something."
"DEAN: Well, I don't like the way he's messing with you."
"RORY: I don't like it either but we have to get through this scene and we can't get through the scene with you standing there. So, Dean, please."
"DEAN: Fine. Call me later. [leaves]"
"TRISTIN: Now I noticed you didn't cry when you kissed him. I'm starting to feel a little insecure."
"RORY: What is wrong with you?"
"TRISTIN: Whoa, I think I liked you better comatose."
"RORY: I thought you weren't going to say anything."
"TRISTIN: Did I say that?"
"RORY: You make it impossible for anyone to be nice to you. No wonder you had to join our group. Anyone who's actually suffered through the experience of going out with you would absolutely know better."
"TRISTIN: Gee, I really wish we could continue your analysis on how pathetic I am. Unfortunately, I have to meet some friends."
"PARIS: Where are you going? Where is he going? We're not finished! Hey, I'm the director here! Tristin!"
"BRAD: Tristin, come back!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Sookie sit at a table.]"
"SOOKIE: Ooh! I'm so excited! Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, it's so romantic. Oh Romeo, blah bah blah and the blah. That's all the Shakespeare I know."
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, you should come with us to Chilton and watch Rory perform."
"LUKE: Can't."
"LORELAI: Come on. How often do you get to see teenagers speak iambic pentameter and k*ll themselves?"
"LUKE: No thanks. But you have a good time. Bring plenty of baseball cards to pass out your phone number on."
"LORELAI: Ugh, enough already! The horse is dead. His ashes have been sprinkled over the land. Let it rest."
"MISS PATTY: Lorelai, there you are you naughty, naughty girl."
"LORELAI: Okay, he was not that much younger than I am. I met him a business school, not his Bar Mitzvah. Business school has to indicate some kind of maturity, right?"
"LUKE: Doogie Howser was a doctor at sixteen."
"LORELAI: Doogie Howser was not real."
"LUKE: How sad for you. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Luke. This is incredible. I go on one stupid date, and suddenly I'm the female Jerry Lee Lewis."
"SOOKIE: Oh forget it honey. The town likes to tease. Plus, he did look really young."
"LORELAI: You didn't even see him."
"SOOKIE: Kirk snapped pictures."
"[Lorelai walks up to Luke behind the counter]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you. What is up with you?"
"LUKE: Nothing's up with me."
"LORELAI: Well we were having a perfectly nasty verbal sparring match and you suddenly walk away."
"BOOTSY: Lorelai, I hear you're dating a kid."
"LORELAI: Please let something big fall on my head."
"BOOTSY: When I was 18, I was dating an older lady. Broke my heart."
"LORELAI: Well, Bootsy, I'm sorry you got dumped, but I'm not dating a kid."
"BOOTSY: I didn't get dumped, she died. Heart attack. She was quite old."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: I'm working. Us older guys do that."
"LORELAI: Why are you being so mean to me?"
"LUKE: I'm not being mean."
"LORELAI: Yes you are. You're being mean."
"LUKE: Sookie, am I being mean?"
"SOOKIE: Well, I wouldn't pay you to put on a red nose and work a birthday party right now."
"LUKE: Thank God for that."
"LORELAI: Why are you so mad at me?"
"LUKE: I just think it's embarrassing."
"LORELAI: What is so embarrassing?"
"LUKE: You running around with that kid."
"LORELAI: I wasn't running, he's not a kid. We had dinner. You say Chuck E. Cheese, I'll break your nose."
"LUKE: Hey, I'm not gonna say anything. You go live your life as you please. I got work to do."
"CUT TO CHILTON GRAND HALL"
"[A group is performing Act 2 of Romeo and Juliet, interpreting it as cavemen. Lorelai, Sookie, Dean, and Lane stand in the audience and watch.]"
"BOY: Ooh, ooh. He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."
"SOOKIE: Are you sure this is Shakespeare?"
"DEAN: What's with all the grunting?"
"LORELAI: I wish Luke was here, he could translate for us."
"[Rory walks up to them]"
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: Oh hey."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"SOOKIE: Oh honey, look at you! You look like a princess! Doesn't she look like a princess?"
"DEAN: Yeah, she looks beautiful."
"RORY: Mom made the dress."
"LORELAI: Not to mention the girl inside it."
"RORY: Hello, gross."
"LORELAI: I'm just saying."
"RORY: I'm getting kind of nervous."
"LANE: Oh, you're gonna be great."
"RORY: I think act three is starting up."
"LANE: Henry's act. Um, how do I look?"
"RORY: You might want to hold a phone up to your face so he'll recognize you."
"LANE: Okay. [walks away]"
"[Paris walks up to them]"
"PARIS: I need you. [drags Rory away]"
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"PARIS: He's not here."
"RORY: Who's not here?"
"PARIS: Tristin. I've looked everywhere. I called his home, his cell, I called three girls I know he's seeing."
"RORY: Paris, calm down."
"PARIS: Weren't you listening? He's not here. We're on in twenty minutes and we don't have a Romeo. We are going to fail."
"RORY: We're not going to fail."
"PARIS: Do you think Harvard accepts people who fail Shakespeare? They don't. I don't have the numbers on it or anything, but I feel pretty secure in saying, you fail Shakespeare, you don't get into Harvard."
"RORY: Okay, maybe he's just in one of the bathrooms smoking."
"PARIS: Good idea. You check the east men's rooms, I'll check the west ones."
"CUT TO GRAND HALL"
"[Lane watches Henry in Act 3, interpreted as businessmen with cell phones]"
"HENRY: I am hurt. A plague on both your houses! Oh, I am sped. What, is he gone and hath nothing?"
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"PARIS: I knew he was going to do this, but no one wanted to listen to me. It was all, let's make Tristin Romeo, he's hot."
"RORY: What about Brad?"
"PARIS: Brad transferred schools. [Tristin walks up to them] Where have you been? You have to get dressed, we're on in ten minutes."
"TRISTIN: Can't."
"PARIS: What?"
"TRISTIN: Actually, my dad had me pulled out of school. He [Paris walks away]  and is she unhappy."
"RORY: What do you mean he had you pulled out of school? What happened?"
"TRISTIN: Nothing. Just ticked the old man off, that's all."
"RORY: By doing what? Tristin, come on, tell me."
"TRISTIN: I got in some trouble."
"RORY: Trouble involving?"
"TRISTIN: Involving Duncan and Bowman, and Bowman's dad's safe."
"RORY: Oh no."
"TRISTIN: I mean, Bowman had a key. It was supposed to be no big deal. And the crazy silent alarm kicked in."
"RORY: You broke into Bowman's dad's safe?"
"TRISTIN: Yes."
"RORY: Stupid."
"TRISTIN: Yes."
"RORY: Well, okay, you can apologize and you can put back the money and you can explain that, I don't know, you were going through something."
"TRISTIN: I was, I was going through his safe."
"RORY: Why would you do this?"
"TRISTIN: I don't know. I guess that's something I can ponder at military school."
"RORY: Military school?"
"TRISTIN: The police are letting our parents handle it, and in my case that means military school in North Carolina."
"RORY: I don't know what to say."
"TRISTIN: Well, I imagine you're overwhelmed with the relief in knowing that soon I will be gone."
"RORY: I'm so sorry."
"TRISTIN: Well, I'm a big boy. I can handle it."
"RORY: There's nothing you can"
"[Tristin's dad calls him from down the hall]"
"MR. Dugray: Tristin, come on."
"TRISTIN: I gotta go. So, I might kiss you goodbye but, uh, your boyfriend's watching. Take care of yourself, Mary."
"[Tristin leaves. Paris comes back dressed as Romeo]"
"PARIS: What are you standing there for? Let's go. You better start sucking on an Altoid."
"CUT TO GRAND HALL"
"[The group performs Act 5 with Paris as Romeo]"
"PARIS: A dateless bargain to engrossing death! Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide! Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! Here's to my love! Oh true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die."
"CUT TO CLASSROOM"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk into a classroom to retrieve their coats]"
"SOOKIE: Wasn't that great? I mean, just watching it made me feel smarter. Don't you feel smarter?"
"LORELAI: Well, just the opposite actually."
"SOOKIE: We should do something else good for us. Go to a museum or play chess."
"LORELAI: I promised Rory we'd go to Luke's afterwards."
"SOOKIE: Oh, even better."
"LORELAI: Although, I gotta tell ya, I am still pretty peeved by how he acted earlier. I swear, that guy runs so hot and cold on me."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, one minute he's all sweet and building me a chuppah, and the next he's being a total jerk for God knows what reason."
"SOOKIE: For God knows what reason? Come on Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Don't you understand that Luke is so into you?"
"LORELAI: Okay, stop."
"SOOKIE: He has had to watch you go from one guy to another, and then the engagement, and then the engagement was off, and patiently he's waited. And now in walks this kid and he says, 'My God, will she date anyone else in the world before she'll date me?'"
"LORELAI: Sookie, that"
"SOOKIE: Hey, maybe it's crazy, maybe it's irrational, but it's there. Just look the guy in the eye, it's right there."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Sookie, and Dean walk in]"
"DEAN: So, did you and Paris actually kiss or was that like a stage thing?"
"RORY: A lady never kisses and tells."
"LORELAI: Hey, you guys get a table. I'll be right there."
"[they sit down while Lorelai walks over to Luke at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: How'd it go?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you know, I think Shakespeare will recover."
"LUKE: That's good."
"LORELAI: Hey, are you good at dating?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Dating, do you have that down?"
"LUKE: Okay, if this is about that kid, then"
"LORELAI: No, it's not about anything, it's just a question."
"LUKE: Well, I don't know if I have it down. Considering I live with my nephew, I'd say probably not."
"LORELAI: I don't have it down either. I've never been very good at it really. I've never even really liked it. Too much 'what if'. I like things I can count on. I mean, uh, actually, with Max, it was the first time I was finally like 'Hey, here it is, that one person who will always be there for me.' And then, I turned around, and it's suddenly 'Oops, wrong, keep moving.'"
"LUKE: Why are you telling me this?"
"LORELAI: I don't have very many people in my life who are in my life permanently forever. They will always be there for me. I will always be there for them, you know? There's Rory, and Sookie, and this town and ... you. I mean, at least I think I've got..."
"LUKE: You do."
"LORELAI: Good. Just checking"
"LUKE: Tell me about Romeo and Juliet."
"LORELAI: Well, it's so depressing because everybody dies, but the clothes were so cute."
"LUKE: Life can be funny that way."
"LORELAI: And Rory [scene fades out]"

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are building a snowman in the center of town.]"
"LORELAI: How do you like that mouth?"
"RORY: Um, it's not very mouthlike."
"LORELAI: Oh, I think it works."
"RORY: It's tilted to the side."
"LORELAI: Yeah, no, it was intentional. It gives her a unique expression."
"RORY: Like she had a stroke?"
"LORELAI: Fine, I'll just use the Mrs. Potato Head lips."
"RORY: No, forget it, leave stroke-mouth. It's not like we're gonna win this anyway."
"LORELAI: Whoa, bad attitude."
"RORY: Mom, face it. That is the single most incredible snowman I have ever seen. [looks at a man working on an elaborate snow sculpture]"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, that snowman is way over the top, way too showy. It's screaming 'I'm incredible, I'm special, look at me.'"
"RORY: Kind of the point of a snowman-building contest."
"LORELAI: Hmm, I hate this man with every fiber of my being."
"RORY: He looks nice."
"LORELAI: He's a ringer."
"RORY: How do you figure?"
"LORELAI: Someone recruited him, promised him a handsome sum, financed his theatrical snowman accoutrements, so he could snatch victory away from a deserving local in order to bag the contest prize for himself."
"RORY: Seems a little elaborate considering that the prize is a set of new US quarters."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're ignoring him now. So, what are we gonna do on your school break?"
"RORY: A lot of nothing."
"LORELAI: Sounds good."
"RORY: Plus some homework."
"LORELAI: And a lot of movies."
"RORY: Oh, we have to rent Godfather 3 on DVD."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"RORY: In the audio commentary, Coppola actually defends casting Sofia."
"LORELAI: Now that is fatherly love. What's all this homework you have to do?"
"RORY: Just stuff for the paper."
"LORELAI: What? Why?"
"RORY: Because Paris wants the first issue back to be a double issue, so we have to prep over break and she says the news never sleeps."
"LORELAI: What about Paris, does she ever sleep?"
"RORY: I think she periodically makes a whirring noise and then just shuts down."
"LORELAI: Well, you can't work the whole time."
"RORY: I won't, I promise. Oh my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: He's power buffing."
"LORELAI: Aw, now that is just wrong."
"RORY: We're competing against the Michelangelo of snow."
"LORELAI: And we're Ernest Builds a Snowman."
"RORY: We shouldn't look at him anymore."
"LORELAI: Heads down, stay focused."
"RORY: We can do this."
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"[their snowman's head falls off]"
"RORY: Let's get some coffee?"
"LORELAI: Right behind you."
"OPENING CREDITS"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel is at the front desk on the phone. In the background, Rune is jumping up and down trying to dust a picture frame.]"
"MICHEL: [oh phone] Yes, you can rent a car in Manhattan and return it in Hartford. That'sthat's no problem, sir. Yes. Yes, you can return it to Bradley International. That'sthat's very convenient. Or youyou canum, you - hold please. [puts phone down, walks over to Rune and grabs his arm]"
"RUNE: Ah!"
"MICHEL: Stop that."
"RUNE: Stop what?"
"MICHEL: Stop jumping like a Mexican bean."
"RUNE: Well, Lorelai asked me to dust the picture frames. How do you suggest that I clean the top, smartie? [Michel takes the picture off the wall] Well, I didn't know that you could do that."
"MICHEL: Yes, I am miraculously talented, aren't I?"
"RUNE: I thought an alarm would go off like in The Thomas Crown Affair."
"MICHEL: That would be if this was a museum, and you were a man allowed in museums."
"LORELAI: Hey, no bickering in the lobby, guys."
"RUNE: Where are we allowed to bicker?"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"SOOKIE: You've got all the mushrooms? You double checked?"
"JACKSON: I've triple checked. I've quadruple checked."
"SOOKIE: The shitake, the nameko, the chanterelle?"
"JACKSON: Once again, I've got it all."
"SOOKIE: The matsutake? The makeniya?"
"JACKSON: Uh wait."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"JACKSON: I don't have makeniya."
"SOOKIE: You don't have makeniya?"
"JACKSON: I don't have makeniya."
"SOOKIE: I made it up. [giggles] You passed the test."
"JACKSON: Don't test me."
"[Lorelai walks in the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Hey, the auditions are starting. You wanna come watch?"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, yes!"
"JACKSON: Auditions for what?"
"SOOKIE: Musicians."
"LORELAI: For the Bracebridge Dinner."
"JACKSON: Geez, you guys are going crazy with this dinner."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, I told you, this dinner is not just about food. We are recreating an authentic 19th century meal."
"LORELAI: The servers are all gonna be in period clothing, they're gonna speak period English. Here, look at the costumes."
"JACKSON: Nice."
"SOOKIE: We're talking seven courses here. Soup, fish, Peacock Pie, the Baron of Beef, the salad, then the Plum Pudding and the Wassail."
"LORELAI: And there's gonna be a big raised platform where the Squire of Bracebridge is going to preside over the festivities."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, he tastes the foods and makes pronouncements. He's like the host of the evening, and his costume is the coolest."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"JACKSON: It all sounds great."
"SOOKIE: Oh, it is, it is. By the way, you're playing Squire Bracebridge. Ready?"
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"SOOKIE: Yeah. [they leave]"
"JACKSON: Huh? What was that?"
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"SOOKIE: What are we looking at today?"
"LORELAI: Okay, this is the last on our list. We've already got our trumpets, our madrigal singers"
"JACKSON: Uh, sorry to interrupt but I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge."
"LORELAI: We've got all our servers lined up. This is just for recorder players and harpists. Hi. Uh, lay some on us guys."
"[two recorder players play]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, you cats really know how to blow those things."
"LORELAI: You've got the gig. I will call you later with the details. Thanks."
"[the recorder players leave]"
"JACKSON: So are we clear on this? I'm not playing Squire Bracebridge. Sorry you were under the impression that I'd do this."
"SOOKIE: When do the guests arrive?"
"LORELAI: Thursday at four - on their own jet."
"SOOKIE: After buying out the whole inn."
"LORELAI: Must be nice to have money."
"SOOKIE: Uh! Hey, you know what struck me today?"
"JACKSON: Was it the fact that I'm not the Squire - did that strike you?"
"SOOKIE: We are crazy for doing this."
"LORELAI: We're beyond crazy. We are 'Anne Heche speaking her secret language to God and looking for the spaceship in Fresno' crazy."
"SOOKIE: Oh Quiness, nokka don atta."
"LORELAI: Il ek notra doska donne."
"JACKSON: And springing this on me at the last minute too, I mean, that's just manipulative."
"[a chef comes out of the kitchen]"
"CHEF: Sookie, fire! [leaves]"
"SOOKIE: I gotta get back in the kitchen. You'll handle the harp?"
"LORELAI: You got it."
"JACKSON: All right, okay, I'll do it. I'll play Squire Bracebridge if that's what you want. Geez."
"SOOKIE: Thanks Sweetie. [walks to kitchen]"
"JACKSON: As long as it's not just because I fit the costume. It's because I fit the costume, isn't it? [leaves]"
"LORELAI: [to harpist] Go ahead."
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings while the harpist is playing]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hi, it's Lorelai."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lor, it's me."
"LORELAI: Oh, hi Chris, how are you?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Good, good. You, uh, got a minute?"
"LORELAI: Uh oh."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's not an uh oh, I just wanted to run an idea by you."
"LORELAI: Run it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Now it's totally your call and I don't want to step on any plans you've already made, but I know Rory has a break in school coming up, and I was wondering if you'd be cool with her coming to visit for a couple of days."
"LORELAI: Uhh, a couple of days? You mean she'd stay the night?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, it's totally your call. Where are you, heaven?"
"LORELAI: Do you even have room for someone to stay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Not just room - a room. A designated guest room. Sherry fixed it up really nice."
"LORELAI: Aww, good for her."
"CHRISTOPHER: So what do you think?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It's awfully last minute."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's totally last minute. You can say no and there'll be no hard feelings."
"LORELAI: Well, it's really up to Rory to say yes or no."
"CHRISTOPHER: So you're cool with it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, sure, if Rory is, yeah."
"CHRISTOPHER: Great, that's great. Uh, thank you. I'll let you run it past her and you can get back to me whenever. No pressure."
"LORELAI: No pressure."
"CHRISTOPHER: Talk to you later."
"LORELAI: Yeah, talk to you later."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily, Richard, Lorelai and Rory are eating dinner silently. Rory get Lorelai's attention and gestures for her to say something.]"
"LORELAI: So what are your travel plans Dad?"
"RICHARD: Hmm?"
"LORELAI: You and mom, you always go out of town this time of year."
"RORY: Last year it was the Bahamas."
"RICHARD: Yes, that's right, it was."
"LORELAI: I remember you had fun too. You said the Bahamamians were real nice. The Bahamites? The Bahamamamamians?"
"RORY: The Bahamians."
"LORELAI: Yes. They were nice."
"EMILY: They were nice."
"LORELAI: So, what are your plans?"
"EMILY: We're not going anywhere this year."
"RORY: Why not? Oh, well yeah, it can be really nice just to stay at home sometimes because you can do fun things that you normally wouldn't have time for."
"LORELAI: Yeah, like play Running Charades, and get out that Slip 'n Slide."
"RICHARD: We'll see."
"EMILY: Yes, we'll see."
"RICHARD: Would you all excuse me? I have to make some calls. Say goodbye before you leave, will you?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, sure Dad."
"[Richard leaves]"
"LORELAI: When is this awfulness with work gonna resolve itself?"
"EMILY: I don't know. The man is so sensitive. He reads so much into every little perceived slight."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I remember one time when I was a kid, Dad had put on some weight, and he bought a new suit to try to cover it up. And he wore it for us and he said, 'How do I look?' and I said, 'You look fat.' [pause] But I guess that wasn't really a perceived slightso, I'll think of another example."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN LOBBY"
"[Sookie is lecturing to a group of people; Kirk is transcribing everything she says on his laptop.]"
"SOOKIE: Keep in mind during the Bracebridge Dinner, we are not just servers, we are performers, so any time you're with a guest, you must be in character and you must speak Old English. It's a world we're creating here, so whatever we can doKirk, you're driving me crazy!"
"KIRK: Who me? [reads transcript] 'Whatever we can do to Kirk you're driving me crazy.' Yeah, me. Ah, sorry."
"SOOKIE: Okay, now guys, look at the materials I gave you, and tell me if a guest asks you how the food's coming, what would be the appropriate Old English response? Rune!"
"RUNE: Greetings!"
"SOOKIE: You just read the first thing on the list, didn't you?"
"RUNE: Maybe."
"SOOKIE: Guys, the correct response: Ah, oven's day with baked meat choke!"
"RUNE: Question?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah?"
"RUNE: What color dress will I be wearing when I say this?"
"JACKSON: Rune, don't be an idiot."
"RUNE: Well, this is stupid."
"JACKSON: Shut up and pay attention to Sookie. She worked very hard to bring this about."
"KIRK: Yes, but unfortunately we don't all share intimacies with her, so she doesn't cut us any slack."
"JACKSON: She doesn't treat me differently."
"KIRK: She's called you Peaches three times. It's all in the transcript."
"RUNE: Sookie, instead of talking in Old English, can I just talk like an old man?"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"RUNE: Hey you kids, get off my lawn!"
"SOOKIE: No, no you cannot just talk like an old man."
"[Lorelai walks into the lobby]"
"SOOKIE: Hi, honey, what's the matter?"
"LORELAI: They're snowed in."
"SOOKIE: Who's snowed in?"
"LORELAI: The Bracebridge group. They're stuck in Chicago. The dinner's off."
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna cry."
"LORELAI: I offered to fund the instant invention of a molecular transport device but they just didn't go for it."
"SOOKIE: Oh, that makes me so mad. And so sad. I'm smad!"
"RUNE: Sookie, does this mean that my pockets wileth not with money get choked? That sounded like Old English. Cool, huh?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai, Sookie, and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"SOOKIE: I've got thirty pounds of aged beef, trays and trays of trout, mountains of pruned tarts. I diced pumpkins until my hands turned orange. I've got pumpkin hands."
"LORELAI: Take a sip"
"SOOKIE: How can you stay so calm about this?"
"LORELAI: There's nothing we can do about it."
"RORY: I can't believe they got snowed in."
"LORELAI: All that work, all that extra help we hired. Oh well. At least they paid for it already. We didn't lose any money."
"SOOKIE: Yeah I guess. You know, I could still make up the dinner for the three of us."
"RORY: Yeah, but then it would be like the three of us, all alone in the dining room."
"LORELAI: It would be like The Shining, except instead of Jack Nicholson, we have Rune."
"[Luke walks over to them]"
"LUKE: You girls want anything besides coffee?"
"SOOKIE: Hey, what about Luke?"
"LUKE: What about him?"
"SOOKIE: He eats, and Jess eats. Doesn't Jess eat?"
"LUKE: What's she doing?"
"LORELAI: I think she's inviting you for dinner."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, come on, join us. It'll be fun. You like Peacock Pie?"
"LUKE: I'm a hundred percent sure I don't."
"LORELAI: There'll be normal food too."
"RORY: And decorations."
"SOOKIE: And music."
"LORELAI: Come on, it'll be fun."
"LUKE: Well"
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what? Let's invite everyone."
"SOOKIE: Everyone who?"
"LORELAI: Everyone everyone."
"SOOKIE: Everyone everyone who?"
"LORELAI: Everyone we know, everyone we like."
"RORY: And they could even stay in the inn. All those empty rooms, all those uneaten pillow mints."
"LORELAI: An out of control, over the top slumber party!"
"SOOKIE: I love it!"
"RORY: Me too!"
"LORELAI: Done! Spread the word."
"LUKE: I haven't said I'd come yet so I'm certainly not gonna suddenly become your messenger boy. [Lorelai stares at him] Eight o'clock?"
"LORELAI: Seven."
"LUKE: Right."
"CUT TO FRONT OF STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Dean walks out of the school, Lane walks over to him.]"
"LANE: Deano."
"DEAN: Hey Lane. Are you going to this big shindig at the inn tonight?"
"LANE: Yeah, I'm just trying to trick my mom into not going with me."
"DEAN: How's that coming along?"
"LANE: How's that Pixies reunion coming along?"
"DEAN: Well, I'll see you and your mom there."
"LANE: Bye."
"DEAN: Bye."
"[Lane leaves. Dean sees Jess fighting with another kid and goes over to break it up.]"
"BOY: Keep it up pal, you'll get hurt."
"DEAN: Whoa, hey guys! Guys, come on, break it up guys! Quit it! Hey, hold it man, get off me! [Dean tries to pull Jess away; Jess tries to punch him] Whoa, hey, get off me man, I'm not fighting you! Jess, knock it off man! What the hell is your problem?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"DEAN: You saw it was me, Jess. Why'd you keep punching?"
"JESS: Had momentum."
"DEAN: Well I was trying to help you."
"JESS: I don't need you help, but thanks for offering."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai sits on the couch as Rory walks in with some drinks.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, did Bootsy RSVP?"
"RORY: Yeah, he's coming."
"LORELAI: Thanks. Is he bringing anybody?"
"RORY: He's coming solo."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'm gonna put him in room 16 with Luke."
"RORY: You can't do that."
"LORELAI: Come on, let me have my fun."
"RORY: Luke's coming with Jess."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll put Jess in with Miss Patty."
"RORY: There will be no Jess left in the morning."
"LORELAI: You stink."
"[Rory sits in the armchair and picks up a pile of cards]"
"RORY: Are these last year's cards or this year's?"
"LORELAI: This year's, of course."
"RORY: Don't scoff. Last year's set were still sitting here 'til Halloween."
"LORELAI: Hey, if that's a crack at my housekeeping k*ll...well then, okay."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: This is one ugly looking baby. Whose baby is this?"
"LORELAI: That's your second cousin's Stan's. Poor kid."
"RORY: Ugh, he got Stan's everything."
"LORELAI: That's not even the ugliest baby in the bunch."
"RORY: You're kidding. [looks through the pile] Ouch!"
"LORELAI: That's the ugliest baby in the bunch."
"RORY: I don't understand why people put pictures on cards."
"LORELAI: Do they not understand we are unapologetic mockers?"
"RORY: There's an unexplained innocence in the world. Hey, I didn't see this."
"LORELAI: See what?"
"RORY: Dad."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: And the woman I'm assuming is Sherry."
"LORELAI: Uh, did I not show you that? Huh."
"RORY: They've got a cute little puppy and everything."
"LORELAI: Oh, I must've put it in the stack and forgotten to tell you about it. Well, there it is."
"RORY: Nice looking lady."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm. Like a young Tammy Faye Baker."
"RORY: But prettier than that."
"LORELAI: Oh, I didn't mean not pretty. Hey, question about the room list."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Room 31 - why is it empty?"
"RORY: Oh yeah, I wanted to run an idea by you."
"LORELAI: Run it."
"RORY: I thought maybe a certain depressed man and his wife could stay there."
"LORELAI: Woody and Soon-Yi?"
"RORY: Grandma and Grandpa."
"LORELAI: Ugh, you've got to be kidding."
"RORY: But this could help to cheer him up."
"LORELAI: I'll send him a Def Jam Comedy tape. That'll cheer him up."
"RORY: It's a really good thing to do."
"LORELAI: We'll donate money to charity, that's a good thing too. We'll stop kicking dogs."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: All right, I'll pencil them in, but they'll probably say no."
"RORY: Yeah, but we're not gonna hope that they say no, right?"
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: Right, because that would be really bad karma, especially on top of making fun of the ugly babies."
"LORELAI: Uh, I have a new year's resolution for you: become more cynical and self absorbed."
"RORY: I'll work on it."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[The night of the Bracebridge Dinner, Lorelai and Rory are in the lobby]"
"RORY: Hey, how's Sookie doing in there?"
"LORELAI: Ah, well, she's paper bagging it."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You know... [Lorelai breathes into a pretend paper bag]"
"RORY: Oh, so she's right on schedule."
"[Babette and Morey walk into the inn.]"
"BABETTE: Hey dolls."
"LORELAI: Hey!"
"RORY: Hi, welcome."
"MOREY: Are we the first ones here?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you are."
"BABETTE: Now don't you freak out. Morey hates being the first anywhere. He thinks it hurts his street credibility."
"MOREY: Charlie Parker was late to everything."
"BABETTE: Charlie Parker had more drugs in him than a Rite-Aid. Forget Charlie Parker."
"RORY: You guys are in room 8. It's all ready for you."
"BABETTE: Thanks, doll. C'mon Morey. We can be late for dinner if it'll make you feel better."
"MOREY: A little."
"BABETTE: Yeah."
"[they walk away as Lane walks into the inn]"
"LANE: Hey!"
"RORY: Are you alone?"
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: My wedding night's gonna be very interesting."
"RORY: Hi Mrs. Kim. I'm glad you guys could come. You guys are in room 12."
"MRS. KIM: Thank you. Hello Lorelai, thank you for inviting us."
"LORELAI: Our pleasure. Do you need help bringing in the rest of your stuff?"
"MRS. KIM: This is my stuff. Don't need any more stuff. People have too much stuff."
"LORELAI: You know you're right. People have too much stuff. Absolutely."
"[Mrs. Kim and Lane walk away]"
"RORY: Says the woman with 64 pairs of shoes."
"LORELAI: Thus proving my point. What is Paris doing here?"
"RORY: She had to bring me the newspaper stuff tonight. She just couldn't wait."
"LORELAI: A robot, she's a robot. Hi! [walks away]"
"RORY: Hey."
"PARIS: So here are the materials in the double issue. Some of the articles are gonna need complete rewrites."
"RORY: Drag."
"PARIS: Madeline's 500 words on test anxiety spends 400 of them arguing that stretch corduroy is the best material for low-rise jeans."
"RORY: Well, let's see. Corduroy is a fabric, and the fabric of society is weakened when students"
"PARIS: You can't get there."
"RORY: Yeah, it doesn't look like it. I'll get right on this tomorrow."
"PARIS: What about tonight?"
"RORY: I'm busy tonight."
"PARIS: Doing what?"
"RORY: Well, this."
"PARIS: Oh. What is this?"
"RORY: It's kind of a big dinner party."
"PARIS: Oh. Okay, well, I'll get out of your way. Call if you need to talk things through, and oh - she uses the Prince version of writing. A letter U for you and a picture of an eye for an I."
"RORY: Wow."
"PARIS: Yeah."
"RORY: Hey Paris, do you have anything going on tonight?"
"PARIS: What's that supposed to mean?"
"RORY: It's supposed to mean, do you have anything going on tonight?"
"PARIS: Well, my parents are out of town, so my Portuguese nanny will make dinner and then I'll either get back to reading the Iliad or we'll play Monopoly. I crush her every time."
"RORY: Well I was just thinking, maybe you want to stay for dinner?"
"PARIS: Here?"
"RORY: Yeah. We have a ton of food, and it's like a whole big show and everything, and if you're not doing anything"
"PARIS: Rereading the Iliad a third time is not not doing anything. I'm not pathetic."
"RORY: I know you're not. I just thought it might be fun, that's all."
"PARIS: Well, I'll have to make a call."
"RORY: Good, make it."
"PARIS: I just have to let Nanny know. [takes out cell phone and dials] Nanny? É Paris. Vou jantar com Rory hoje à noite. Eu telefono no caminho de casa. Tchau."
"[Dean and Clara walk into the inn]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hello there. Hey Clara. Nice, is that a Stella McCartney?"
"CLARA: It's a Wal-Mart."
"RORY: Well, it's very pretty."
"CLARA: My mom bought it for tonight."
"RORY: She's got good taste."
"DEAN: [sees Jess walk in] I didn't know he was coming."
"RORY: Who?"
"DEAN: Jess."
"RORY: Yeah. Is that a problem?"
"DEAN: Not really."
"RORY: Dean."
"DEAN: It's just that, he got into this fight with this guy at school, and when I broke it up he started in on me."
"RORY: He hit you?"
"DEAN: He tried."
"RORY: Why would he do that?"
"DEAN: Don't ask me to explain that jerk. [Jess waves] He better not do that all night."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"SOOKIE: No! It tastes too twentieth century guys. It's gotta shout Washington Irving, not Irving my accountant. It needs something, help me. What is it?"
"CHEF: Uhh"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: How's it going? AGH!"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Ooh! Ew, Rune naked, naked Rune."
"[Rune is changing his pants in the corner]"
"SOOKIE: Ahh!"
"RUNE: These stupid pants won't go past my thighs."
"LORELAI: Why are you dressing in here?"
"RUNE: The bathrooms are full and the lousy madrigal singers are bull guarding the supply closet so this is the only place."
"SOOKIE: They're too small."
"RUNE: My thighs are too big."
"LORELAI: Ahh! Rune, yes, but in lieu of coming up with something that would immediately reduce the size of your thighs, why don't we get you a bigger pair of pants?"
"SOOKIE: And a different place to dress."
"LORELAI: Definitely."
"RUNE: Well, can you get me the supply closet?"
"LORELAI: We'll take it by force if we have to. Go. Ah. [Rune leaves] Is everything under control?"
"SOOKIE: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye...no. This needs something and I cannot think of what it is. It's that tart, kind of spicy, white. . .salt! The word is salt!"
"LORELAI: You forgot the word for salt?"
"SOOKIE: Everything's under control."
"LORELAI: Good."
"SOOKIE: Absolutely, one hundred percent."
"LORELAI: You're exuding confidence. Have the oxygen ready."
"SOOKIE: Okay, easy. It's a bird, it's a bird."
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[Lorelai walks into the lobby as Emily and Richard arrive]"
"LORELAI: They're here."
"RORY: Who?"
"LORELAI: The Joy-less Luck Club."
"RICHARD: Hello girls. You look particularly lovely tonight."
"RORY: Thanks Grandpa."
"LORELAI: Thanks Dad. You guys look nice yourselves."
"EMILY: Seems like the occasion called for it."
"RICHARD: The air seems crisper here than Hartford. It's wonderful."
"LORELAI: Hey Dad, you didn't grab the wrong prescription bottle earlier today, did you?"
"RICHARD: What?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"EMILY: I think she was making one of her funny jokes."
"RICHARD: Oh, went straight over my head."
"LORELAI: Let me get someone to help you with your bags."
"RICHARD: No, no, I've got them. Just point me to the room."
"RORY: You guys are in room 31, best room in the place."
"RICHARD: Oh, anything's fine. I'll, uh, see you in a bit. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: What got into him?"
"RORY: He's totally different."
"EMILY: I know. He's been that way for two days. I have no idea why but I'm taking the credit."
"LORELAI: Ugh, a hostess' job is never done. Hi."
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[All the guests are mingling in the lobby.]"
"LORELAI: Hey everybody, will you gather round? Everyone, everyone! First of all, I want to welcome you to the first annual and probably never ever to be held again because Sookie's on the verge of a nervous breakdown Bracebridge Dinner."
"SOOKIE: I'm fine, everything's fine."
"LORELAI: I also want to thank Mother Nature for snowing in the Trelling Paper Company in Chicago so I can throw this great party for all my friends instead. It's a very special night. And so, since I don't get to eat unbelievably strange food with my friends everyday, I have arranged a little surprise. Outside, as we speak, is a line of horse drawn sleighs and everybody gets a ride. So, uh, line up and keep it orderly. There's two per sleigh and no cutting in front of each other - that goes for everyone. Except me, 'cause I'll be damned if I'm gonna miss a ride in a horse drawn sleigh. Come on."
"LUKE: You gonna go?"
"JESS: I think I'll wait for the clog dancing."
"DEAN: Hey, hey, don't move."
"CLARA: But we're gonna miss all the good horses!"
"RORY: Who is this brazen woman competing for your attention?"
"CLARA: Come on!"
"DEAN: Uh, I guess I'm spoken for."
"RORY: I'll see you back here."
""
""
""
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai is sitting in one of the sleighs as Luke and Bootsy stand near the horses]"
"BOOTSY: You see the horses?"
"LUKE: You mean the ones three feet from my face? Yeah, I saw 'em."
"BOOTSY: I spent a summer training horses in Montana."
"LUKE: You get kicked in the head a lot?"
"BOOTSY: Just the once."
"LORELAI: Hey, you in the belt - get in."
"LUKE: What? Oh, no, I was just sort of checking things out."
"LORELAI: Come on. We can pull a Ben Hur and take down Taylor's sleigh."
"LUKE: I don't know, I..."
"LORELAI: Aww, come on Luke. I can't be all school marm-y and ride by myself. Please?"
"LUKE: Well, okay. [gets in the sleigh]"
"LORELAI: Giddy up. [the sleigh starts moving] Uh! The horses heard me, I speak horse language! I'm Dr. Dolittle!"
"LUKE: Plus, I think the driver of the sleigh heard you."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah."
"LUKE: I gotta say, sleigh ride's a little much, but these horses are really beautiful."
"LORELAI: Yes, especially from this angle."
"LUKE: Not just from this angle."
"LORELAI: Oh seriously, don't backtrack. Horse has got a nice butt there."
"LUKE: It's not what I'm saying."
"LORELAI: Nice firm hiney."
"LUKE: Stop talking about the horse's hiney."
"LORELAI: God, the town looks beautiful."
"LUKE: Same as always."
"LORELAI: No, it's always different his time of year. It's magical."
"LUKE: If you say so, sure. Oh look, there's the magical plumbing supply store where I bought a magical float for my toilet last week."
"LORELAI: You disappoint me."
"LUKE: Oh look. There's the magical Luke's Diner right underneath the apartment that Jess magically lit by leaving every stinkin' light on."
"LORELAI: How's it going with you guys?"
"LUKE: Me and Jess? Great."
"LORELAI: Great? Really?"
"LUKE: Really."
"LORELAI: Well, good."
"LUKE: It is good. I mean, it was hard at first, seemed impossible, you know, but I've learned a lot these past couple months."
"LORELAI: Like?"
"LUKE: Like last week I discovered the secret of parenting."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"LUKE: Yup."
"LORELAI: The secret of parenting?"
"LUKE: The secret of parenting."
"LORELAI: When last week? Last Tuesday?"
"LUKE: I don't know the exact day."
"LORELAI: Tuesday at 5:15, is that when you discovered the secret of parenting?"
"LUKE: Don't mock."
"LORELAI: Well, tell me. What is. . . oh wait, it's a secret, you can't tell me."
"LUKE: No, I'll tell you. You visualize the reality you want."
"LORELAI: You visualize the reality you want."
"LUKE: And then if necessary, you lie to bring it about."
"LORELAI: That is so much worse than I was expecting."
"LUKE: You never lied to your kid?"
"LORELAI: Ahh, to save her from great physical pain, yes. When she was little and she would play in the kitchen, I told her that the burners were the devil's hands, but I would say it in a really scary evangelist voice, you know, 'Don't touch the devil's hands!' She still doesn't go near the stove."
"LUKE: Yes, exactly. You told a little white lie for your kid's protection, very similar to what I've done."
"LORELAI: Which was?"
"LUKE: Well, you know the winter break is coming up?"
"LORELAI: Yes I do."
"LUKE: Okay, well that means Jess has some time off from school. His mom knew that and she never called."
"LORELAI: Ugh, it makes me sick"
"LUKE: So I decided just to keep Jess with me, and I told him that his mom wanted him to come home but I thought since he just got there and was still adjusting that I thought he should stay, and his mom was really upset but I insisted. He bought it hook, line and sinker. Saved him a lot of hurt."
"LORELAI: He didn't buy it."
"LUKE: What? Of course he did."
"LORELAI: He knows."
"[cut to Richard and Emily's sleigh]"
"EMILY: I wish Lorelai had warned us about this."
"RICHARD: What? This is wonderful.."
"EMILY: It's wreaking havoc with my hair."
"RICHARD: Oh this is not bad for your hair, compared to the other thing."
"EMILY: What other thing? [Richard tousles her hair] Richard, stop it! Stop it! Suddenly you're two years old."
"RICHARD: Oh, I'm just having fun."
"EMILY: I'm not complaining."
"RICHARD: This is fun too. This is like a roller coaster."
"EMILY: A little."
"RICHARD: Say, when was the last time we were on a roller coaster?"
"EMILY: Never."
"RICHARD: Didn't we ever go to Coney Island?"
"EMILY: That must've been your other wife."
"RICHARD: Gosh, I used to love it when I was a kid. They were a lot faster then too."
"EMILY: And less safe."
"RICHARD: We should go on one."
"EMILY: What?"
"RICHARD: A fast one."
"EMILY: Fine. You go and I'll wait and hold your cotton candy for you."
"RICHARD: You are going."
"EMILY: It would take a whole day."
"RICHARD: You are going."
"EMILY: I'd be scared."
"RICHARD: I'll hold your hand."
"EMILY: Fine. We'll go on a roller coaster."
"RICHARD: Good."
"EMILY: Now where is this roller coaster we're going on?"
"RICHARD: I'm not sure. I'll get Rory to look it up on the Internet for us."
"[cut to Rory getting in a sleigh]"
"DRIVER: That it miss?"
"RORY: I guess I'm alone."
"[The sleigh starts going. Jess jumps into the seat next to Rory]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"JESS: Well, I heard it was two to a sleigh - no more, no less. You were breaking the rules."
"RORY: You could've hurt yourself."
"JESS: I live on the edge. I can jump out if you want."
"RORY: Doesn't matter to me."
"JESS: Are you mad at me or something?"
"RORY: What do you think?"
"JESS: I can't read your mind."
"RORY: You got into a fight with Dean."
"JESS: Dean?"
"RORY: My boyfriend."
"JESS: Ah. He's still your boyfriend?"
"RORY: Okay, you can jump out now."
"JESS: I wasn't fighting him. I was fighting someone else. He jumped in on his own."
"RORY: He was trying to help you."
"JESS: Oh, he should go into government service if he's so interested in helping people. But me, he can stop worrying about."
"RORY: Why were you fighting in the first place?"
"JESS: 'Cause Chuck Presby's a jerk."
"RORY: You were fighting Chuck Presby?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: Oh, he is a jerk."
"JESS: This whole town is weird and full of jerks."
"RORY: Then why are you still here?"
"JESS: What do you mean?"
"RORY: I mean, school's out and you don't like it here, so why don't you just go home?"
"JESS: My mom didn't want me to."
"RORY: I don't believe that."
"JESS: That's your right, I guess."
"RORY: Did Luke say she didn't want you to?"
"JESS: Luke told me it was his idea that I should stay. It wasn't his idea. That's good."
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: Your snowman. Snowwoman, actually."
"RORY: You know which one is ours?"
"JESS: It definitely has the most personality. Kind of looks like Bjork."
"RORY: That's what we were going for."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: But everyone thinks the one on the end is gonna be the winner."
"JESS: Really? It's so overdone."
"RORY: I agree."
"JESS: You should win."
"RORY: No argument."
"JESS: Hey, what do you and Dean talk about?"
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: I mean, does he know Bjork?"
"RORY: I've played him some stuff."
"JESS: Hm. So you got a teacher-student thing going?"
"RORY: Stop."
"JESS: No, really, I'm curious. What do you guys talk about?"
"RORY: Everything."
"JESS: Like?"
"RORY: Just everything, tons of stuff, whatever."
"JESS: It's just in the brief non-pugilistic time I've spent with him in class, he just doesn't seem like your kind of guy."
"RORY: Well, he is my kind of guy. He's exactly my kind of guy."
"JESS: Okay. I guess I don't know him that well."
"RORY: You don't. You don't."
"CUT TO INN DINING ROOM"
"[All of the guests are seated at a long table. Lorelai stands at the head of the table with a camera.]"
"LORELAI: Quiet please, everybody. Before the, uh, button popping and the bloating can commence, say cheese."
"EVERYONE: Cheese!"
"LORELAI: Uh, now, ladies and gentlemen, damen und herren, um, the moment you've been waiting for, I give you the Bracebridge Dinner."
"SOOKIE: Whoa, whoa, hold it. We just need a quick minute, please."
"LORELAI: Which will be starting in one quick minute."
"BOOTSY: You ever think about that? You can't have a quick minute because it's always sixty seconds."
"LUKE: Shut up."
"MISS PATTY: Lorelai darling, who is the silver fox with the tight kneesocks?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's Claude. He's one of our regular servers, divorced and on the market."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, well the uniform is interesting."
"LORELAI: All right. I'll have him bathed, powdered, and sent to your room."
"MISS PATTY: What? Oh, you joke? Was that a joke?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, this is just beautiful. It's like something out of Architectural Digest. You should be very proud."
"LORELAI: Thanks Dad."
"EMILY: Your dress needs pressing."
"LORELAI: Thanks Mom."
"[Lorelai sits down next to Rory]"
"LORELAI: Your pod Grandpa is still happy as a clam."
"RORY: See, I told you this would be good for him."
"LORELAI: When you're right, you're right."
"RUNE: Welcome Lords and Ladies. I call upon these sprightly horns to commence our proceedings. [horns play] Hey Chuck Mangione, you wanna back up a step?"
"LORELAI: And we're off."
"RUNE: And now, fair people, I present my Lord and Master, the honorable Squire Bracebridge."
"[Jackson enters the room dressed as the Squire]"
"JACKSON: Lo! Now has come our joyfullest feast. Let every man be jolly."
"JESS: We should've eaten before we came."
"LUKE: Shh! And yeah."
"JACKSON: Humble servant, bring us the first course to dine with pleasure. Mmm, methinks it be a butternut squash soup."
"RUNE: Ah, methinks you're right Squire Bracebridge, thus and verily."
"JACKSON: And verily thus."
"LORELAI: They're the Old England Abbot and Costello."
"JACKSON: 'Tis perfection, but extremely hot."
"RUNE: My Lord, do you need aid? Wouldst thou have thee ice thy tongue?"
"JACKSON: Ah nay, Rune, nay. To the guests thou shall serve the soup!"
"JESS: What's the white stuff?"
"LUKE: I think it's cheese - or cream."
"JESS: And the green stuff?"
"LUKE: I think it'sbest picked off."
"MRS. KIM: No one says grace?"
"LANE: I think they all do Mama, uh, silently."
"MRS. KIM: Did you say silent grace?"
"BABETTE: [laughs] Good one!"
"[Mrs. Kim stares at her. Babette quickly bows her head and nudges for Morey to do the same. Cut to Kirk serving soup to Lorelai and Rory]"
"KIRK: Soup for mi'ladies?"
"RORY: Why thank you, kind sir."
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk, nice blouse."
"RORY: Don't let her make fun of you Kirk. You look great."
"KIRK: Soup with garlands, gay and rosemary."
"LORELAI: You're gonna stay in character no matter what, huh?"
"KIRK: 'Tis hot, so proceed daintily."
"LORELAI: Hey, did you ever see that I Love Lucy where she goes to Buckingham Palace?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: She tries to get the palace guard to break character. That was a funny one."
"KIRK: 'Tis foreign to me good lady."
"RORY: Hang in there, Kirk."
"LORELAI: Those ones where she was in Europe, hands down, those were the best!"
"KIRK: No way, the Hollywood ones!"
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"KIRK: Damn!"
"RORY: I was rooting for you boy."
"[Cut to later that evening]"
"RUNE: My Lord, shall dessert be served?"
"JACKSON: Anon, humble servant."
"CLARA: Can I eat my dessert with the horses?"
"DEAN: Sure, uh, but put your coat on."
"CLARA: Are you okay?"
"BOOTSY: I guess so. I've lost track of how many beers I've had."
"CLARA: Seven."
"LORELAI: Hey Paris, how's it going?"
"PARIS: Fine, good, thanks for having me."
"LORELAI: Oh, it was our pleasure."
"PARIS: Did you notice the anachronisms?"
"LORELAI: The what?"
"PARIS: The period discrepancies. They were pretty blatant. I mean, forget that the nineteenth century didn't include recessed lighting or the Fossil watch that your server was wearing, but water in that period would not have been served with cubed ice."
"LORELAI: Right."
"PARIS: And your servers are wearing nylon blend shirts, and nylon was invented by a scientist at Dupont in the 1920's. It shattered the illusion."
"LORELAI: Floggings will be administered."
"RICHARD: So there we are, it's a beautiful moonlit Prague night, and we're strolling across the Charles Bridge when we come across this group of kids blasting this song by that. . .oh, that awful woman. Who is she? The tall bony one, married to the deceased mustachioed congressman."
"RORY: Cher?"
"EMILY: That's the one!"
"LORELAI: The year of 'Do you believe in life after love?'"
"RORY: A difficult time for all of us."
"MICHEL: I like that song."
"RICHARD: Well, I was appalled. Prague has played host to some of the greatest composers in history. Mozart named a symphony after it, for heaven's sake. So what did I do?"
"EMILY: I have tried so hard to forget this."
"RICHARD: I stood beside them and their boombox and I hummed Mozart's Prague Symphony as loud as I could. [starts humming]"
"LORELAI: A bizarro Battle of the Bands."
"TAYLOR: And did it work?"
"RICHARD: Well, they quickly packed up and went their way."
"EMILY: But then he kept on humming the Mozart. He wouldn't stop."
"RICHARD: Well, at that point I was hoping for some gullible tourists to drop money at my feet."
"EMILY: And two of them did."
"RICHARD: And I kept it!"
"TAYLOR: You know, this might be the most interesting conversation I've ever had with an insurance man."
"RICHARD: Aww, I'm hurt."
"TAYLOR: I'm sorry Richard. What I meant was that"
"RICHARD: No, what you meant was that people in the insurance industry are drones. Well I agree. They are a dull, dull lot, and I am glad to be rid of them."
"LORELAI: Rid of them?"
"TAYLOR: Oh, are you retired Richard?"
"RICHARD: Well, uh"
"EMILY: Of course he's not. Richard? Richard?"
"RICHARD: Actually, I am."
"CUT TO BEDROOM"
"[Later that evening, Lorelai and Rory are in their room at the inn getting ready for bed.]"
"LORELAI: Ah, it's always nice to end a big festive meal with a big festive pall hanging over the room."
"RORY: Most people didn't notice anything."
"LORELAI: I guess. Bootsy singing Hotel California accompanied by spoons drew people's attention away."
"RORY: Did Grandma and Grandpa say a word to each other the rest of the night?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why didn't he tell anyone?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, are you asking me to interpret my parents' motives?"
"RORY: My mistake. So which bed do you want?"
"LORELAI: Take the one by the window."
"RORY: Okay. [pulls back blanket] Mom!"
"LORELAI: What honey?"
"RORY: You put the picture of the ugly baby in my bed?"
"LORELAI: I didn't, I swear. That ugly baby is stalking us. Run away!"
"RORY: Poor baby, it's not his fault."
"LORELAI: I think it's a she."
"RORY: Poor baby, you picked the wrong parents. Hey, have you heard from Dad recently?"
"LORELAI: What dad - your dad?"
"RORY: Yeah, my dad."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because he's my dad, and he usually checks in this time of year and he hasn't checked in yet. I mean, I know he's probably busy with Sherry and the new apartment and...what?"
"LORELAI: There may have been a call."
"RORY: There may have been? You don't remember?"
"LORELAI: Well things have been so hectic, you know, with the Bracebridge Dinner, and um, building a snowwoman, and planning the ugly baby gag, that took time."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he called! He called, he called, he called and invited you, and it's not too late to go. He called and invited you, so there you go. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, so there."
"RORY: He invited me over?"
"LORELAI: Yes, are you deaf?"
"RORY: No, I'm just trying to separate the gist from the ubububububah."
"LORELAI: Well, the gist is he invited you, okay?"
"RORY: Why didn't he invite me himself?"
"LORELAI: Because he's pretending to be considerate by running it past me first."
"RORY: Was he maybe not pretending to be considerate, and actually being considerate?"
"LORELAI: Maybe. But I wouldn't put it past him to be inconsiderate. The guy doesn't have the greatest track record."
"RORY: Why didn't you tell me this? He's probably waiting for my answer, and holding off making plans."
"LORELAI: Because I have dibs on this time of year with you, not him! Me! And yes, he acknowledged that, and that was cool and all, but still - it stinks! Because he put me in a very difficult position because we were supposed to watch a lot of movies and make fun of Godfather 3, and the thing that I really, really hate about this isis the idea of you not hanging out with me because you're hanging out there with your stupid stepmother."
"RORY: You're calling Sherry my stepmother?"
"LORELAI: Well, she practically is."
"RORY: You're wigging."
"LORELAI: There is something wrong with that woman."
"RORY: You don't even know her."
"LORELAI: You think I'm overreacting?"
"RORY: I think you're jealous of Sherry."
"LORELAI: Ha, I'm not jealous of Sherry."
"RORY: But I understand - your territory has been threatened."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RORY: But relax, there are ways to work through situations like this - compromises can be struck."
"LORELAI: Oh, what are you saying?"
"RORY: Well, you know, I can still call you Mom, and I'll call her Mommy Sherry."
"LORELAI: Don't be mean."
"RORY: And we can split up holidays evenly. Like, I'll be with you on Labor Day"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY:  her on Memorial Day."
"LORELAI: Enough."
"RORY: I'll have to find out about her religion though to see how Chanukah will factor into this, unless you want to convert to Judaism and then take over Chanukah for yourself."
"LORELAI: I get the point. I overreacted. Please stop."
"RORY: You totally overreacted. God."
"LORELAI: So do you think you're gonna go and stay with them?"
"RORY: I'll have to think about it."
"LORELAI: Do you have to think about it because you know that it's k*ll me not to know whether you're going or not and you want to torture me like that?"
"RORY: Nope, I just don't know if I want to do it."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: It was nice of him to ask though."
"LORELAI: It was very nice."
"RORY: 'Cause we are rooting for Dad."
"LORELAI: We are rooting for him. It was a very nice thing that Christopher offered. I was being a little possessive."
"RORY: And insanely jealous of his pretty girlfriend."
"LORELAI: Well, I wanna know if she's good enough for him."
"RORY: Me too."
"LORELAI: So there was an altruistic streak to my madness."
"RORY: We'll go with that."
"[there's a knock at the door. Lorelai answers, Emily is there.]"
"EMILY: I need a new room."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: I can't stay in that room."
"LORELAI: There are no other rooms, Mom."
"EMILY: Well, then I'll go home."
"RORY: Grandma, it's late."
"LORELAI: And pitch black, and the roads are icy. You can't be driving."
"EMILY: Well, I'm not going back to that room."
"LORELAI: I'm guessing you and Dad had it out about the job thing?"
"EMILY: We haven't even spoken since dinner. I'm so upset, I wouldn't know where to begin. And I couldn't take being around him anymore. What he did is inexcusable. Not letting me know he left his job - as if it didn't affect me?"
"LORELAI: Aw mom, try to calm down. Here, take this bed, and Rory and I will share."
"EMILY: I'm just a burden."
"LORELAI: You're not a burden, Mom."
"EMILY: Well, okay, thank you. Can I use the mirror in the bathroom for a second?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I'll use the one out here."
"[Rory watches as Lorelai and Emily both apply cream to their face]"
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Behold my future."
"EMILY: How do you turn out the light?"
"LORELAI: I'll get it."
"EMILY: I still can't believe it."
"LORELAI: Try to relax Mom."
"EMILY: I hope he doesn't sleep because I surely won't."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom."
"EMILY: These slippers you have here are hardly one size fits all. They're too big."
"LORELAI: Goodnight."
"EMILY: It was so irresponsible."
"LORELAI: Maybe he had no choice."
"EMILY: Of course he had a choice. Go to sleep Lorelai."
"LORELAI: That job was k*ll him, Mom. It was k*ll him."
"EMILY: I'm going for a little walk."
"RORY: Grandma, it's late."
"EMILY: I'm not tired."
"LORELAI: Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Gilmores of our lives."
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[Emily walks in and finds Richard sitting on the sofa]"
"EMILY: I didn't know you were here."
"RICHARD: Emily, don't go."
"EMILY: I'm very tired."
"RICHARD: I want to talk to you, please. I don't need to remind you about how I've been feeling at work, and my frustration just built to the point whereagain, you know this. So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time with my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest. I noticed Floyd's secretary staring at me, and I realized it was because I was smiling. Well, nobody had seen me smile there in a very long time. I was. . .I was happy."
"EMILY: And you chose not to tell me? Your own wife."
"RICHARD: Oh Emily, I know I've done nothing but disappoint you these past few months, what with how isolated I've become and all the social engagements I've made you cancel, and all the friendships I've jeopardized. And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options. Not a terribly significant amount, but an amount all the same."
"EMILY: Richard, let's just go to bed."
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[The next morning, the guests are leaving]"
"RORY: See ya Bootsy."
"BOOTSY: See ya, thanks. By the way, last night did I sing Hotel California?"
"RORY: From beginning to end."
"LORELAI: While banging spoons on your head."
"BOOTSY: Well that explains the lumps."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"MISS PATTY: Lorelai, darling, oh thank you for everything."
"LORELAI: Patty, your timing is excellent. There's Claude over there. Want me to do some matchmaking?"
"MISS PATTY: Aww, he's wearing a golf shirt and cotton Dockers."
"LORELAI: So it was the uniform, huh?"
"MISS PATTY: Aw, it's the Biloxi Naval Base all over again."
"LORELAI: See ya."
"MISS PATTY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Hey Mom. You didn't make it back to the room last night. Did you get lucky?"
"EMILY: Could you be any cruder?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I can be cruder. Hey mom, did you get la"
"RORY: Thanks for coming! It was fun. Is everything okay?"
"RICHARD: Everything's okay."
"EMILY: We'll see you next Friday."
"LORELAI: Bye. Bye Dad."
"RICHARD: Bye Lorelai."
"SOOKIE: You just had one grub too many. Just drink lots of water to rehydrate."
"JACKSON: I will."
"LORELAI: Jackson, thank you for being our Squire."
"JACKSON: Oh, you're welcome. Hey, uh, by the way, last night when Bootsy was singing Hotel California and banging spoons on his head, did I"
"LORELAI: Lift up your shirt and play drums on your stomach? Yes you did."
"JACKSON: Oh boy."
"RORY: You kept a good b*at."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, 'cause God knows if the b*at was off, you'd have embarrassed yourself."
"CLARA: Thanks Rory."
"RORY: Clara, I'm glad you came."
"DEAN: So I'll see you later."
"CLARA: Don't kiss."
"DEAN: Aw, come on."
"CLARA: Don't kiss."
"[Dean covers Clara's eyes while he kisses Rory]"
"CLARA: Come on."
"DEAN: So I guess we're off."
"RORY: I guess so."
"[Dean walks away, then glances back and sees Rory and Jess smiling at each other]"
"LORELAI: Bye you guys. Ugh, let's go home."
"RORY: Are we coming to get our bags later?"
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because we're walking home. I don't want to carry 'em."
"LORELAI: Who says we're walking?"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory ride home in a horse-drawn sleigh.]"
"LORELAI: This is the only way to ride."
"RORY: I wholeheartedly agree."
"[Lorelai sees that the elaborate overdone snowman has been smashed]"
"LORELAI: Whoa, what happened there?"
"RORY: I have no idea."
"LORELAI: Bad news for ringer guy. But guess who wins by default?"
"RORY: I guess that would be us."

"OPEN AT LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai sits at a table doing homework as Luke walks around pouring coffee]"
"LORELAI: Time?"
"LUKE: 4:30."
"LORELAI: Fill me up?"
"LUKE: That's your sixth cup."
"LORELAI: Yes it is."
"LUKE: How 'bout some tea?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely, throw it in with the coffee."
"LUKE: I assume Rory's meeting you here."
"LORELAI: Yes she is and she's late and I have to go to class tonight so that means I have ten more minutes."
"[Rory enters the diner holding an envelope]"
"RORY: I got it!"
"LORELAI: You did?"
"RORY: Right here."
"LORELAI: Ooh! Well hurry up, open it! Leave the pot Ethel."
"LUKE: I'm just an enabler."
"LORELAI: Okay, just remember these are PSATs, okay, so it's like the Baby Gap, they don't count as much. Plus, you can take them over again. Plus, you are very young and have years of learning ahead of you and the really important thing is that you tried very hard."
"RORY: I got a 740 verbal and a 760 math."
"LORELAI: Ugh, thank God you're not an idiot."
"RORY: I got a 740 verbal and a 760 math?"
"LORELAI: Those are damn good scores little lady, really. Amazing, top notch. Those are PSAT-rific. Sorry, it was just lying there, I had to go for it. You're frowning."
"RORY: How did I get a higher score in math?"
"LORELAI: Who cares?"
"RORY: But I'm stronger in verbal. Verbal is my thing."
"LORELAI: No, verbal's my thing."
"RORY: Maybe I didn't study hard enough. Maybe I got cocky."
"LORELAI: Maybe you need a major mud bath/salt glow/chill pill combo."
"RORY: I'm just saying. . ."
"LORELAI: Rory, you got a great score."
"RORY: Yeah but. . ."
"LORELAI: No, a great score."
"RORY: A great score?"
"LORELAI: That is a score you have earned and you deserve and will allow you to look down on me for many years to come."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay. So we should celebrate. Hey, how about we get all dressed up tonight and hit the Rocky Horror Picture Show?"
"RORY: Are you serious?"
"LORELAI: Please, I'm always serious."
"RORY: Can I invite Lane?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"RORY: Okay. I hope she gets this in time. She's been kind of hard to reach lately."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe she can't handle the pressure of having such a brilliant best friend. Brilliant in math, the verbal's kinda sad."
"RORY: Thank you Mom."
"LUKE: You're late."
"LORELAI: Oh sh**t, I am. I have to go. Hey, Rory kicked some major PSAT ass today."
"LUKE: Yeah? Congratulations."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: And to celebrate, we're gonna hit the Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. I am Magenta, Rory usually opts for Janet, and I had a thought."
"LUKE: Oh yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I was thinking that you could put on some fishnet stockings, a leather teddy, some platform boots, and go with us as Dr. Frank-N-Furter."
"LUKE: Hmm. Well, now that is a thought."
"LORELAI: You'll also need some gloves and a wig."
"LUKE: Gloves, wigs, got it."
"LORELAI: I'll do your makeup."
"LUKE: Oh, that'll be a help."
"LORELAI: There you go."
"LUKE: Okay, sounds great."
"LORELAI: Great. So eight o'clock, I'll swing around and get ya?"
"LUKE: Sure, good."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: Oh hey, if by some chance you knock on the door but no one answers even though all the lights are on, I'll just meet you there."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: So I'll see you tomorrow morning?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I'll be the one with the coffee."
"LORELAI: [to Rory] Hey, make sure you gloat a little. It's good for the skin."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is lying in bed as her alarm is going off. She turns it off, sits up, puts on her robe and walks into the kitchen. She smiles at Rory as she pours herself a cup of coffee, then walks outside along the front porch. As she goes to pick up the newspaper, her foot goes through the porch.]"
"LORELAI: Agh! Rory!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"RORY: So do you think the porch is falling apart or do you just weigh a ton?"
"LORELAI: The porch is fine. It just has a little extra ventilation in it now, that's all."
"RORY: The wood is old and rotting."
"LORELAI: The wood is not old and rotting, it is strong and sprightly and will be with us for a long, long time to come."
"RORY: So you do weigh a ton?"
"[Kirk opens the back door]"
"KIRK: Well, I checked under the entire house."
"LORELAI: And?"
"KIRK: You have termites."
"LORELAI: What?"
"KIRK: Tens of thousands of them. Subterranean, dry wood, the whole gamut."
"RORY: Gross."
"KIRK: Four of them crawled up my noise."
"LORELAI: Okay, Kirk."
"KIRK: It happens all the time when you're upside down. To them the nostril looks just like another hollow passage in the wood. They're not too bright."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, we have termites. So what do we - um, don't you want to come inside Kirk?"
"KIRK: Actually, I would prefer to discuss this outside."
"LORELAI: Kirk?"
"CUT TO FRONT PORCH"
"KIRK: Okay, let's get down to it. From what I've just witnessed, your house is a bug-infested smorgasbord. Are those for me?"
"ORY: Oh, yeah. [hands him some waffles]"
"KIRK: Thanks."
"LORELAI: But what do we do?"
"KIRK: Well. . .uh, if you don't mind, I'd prefer to discuss this on the lawn."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"KIRK: Because this porch could give out on us at any minute."
"LORELAI: Kirk, that's crazy. Kirk, stop, the porch is fine."
"RORY: Your foot went through it this morning."
"LORELAI: That was different, that wood was old."
"RORY: What happened to sprightly?"
"LORELAI: Kirk, what are you doing?"
"KIRK: Just making sure that if the roof comes down, the debris can't ricochet over here and take me out."
"LORELAI: Honey, in five more minutes, it won't need to."
"KIRK: What?"
"LORELAI: Kirk, please, talk to me about the termites. What do I have to do, tent the place?"
"KIRK: To start with, yes."
"RORY: To start with?"
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"KIRK: It means they've done some serious damage under there. They've eaten through the wooden joists. Your foundation has completely lost its structural integrity."
"RORY: Mom, our house is falling down."
"LORELAI: Okay, what do I have to do to fix this?"
"KIRK: You'd have to jack the house up, rebuild the jousts, and repair the weakened parts of the foundation."
"LORELAI: All for the low, low price of?"
"KIRK: Well, I haven't done the exact estimate, but I'd say somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen thousand dollars."
"LORELAI: [laughs] Tell it to move to another neighborhood."
"KIRK: I'm sorry?"
"LORELAI: Fifteen thousand dollars?"
"RORY: We're never eating again."
"LORELAI: I don't have fifteen thousand dollars. I've never had fifteen thousand dollars. I'm trying to picture fifteen thousand dollars - I can't! That's how unfamiliar fifteen thousand dollars and I are with each other!"
"KIRK: Well, maybe you can just fix part of the house. Fix the part you like."
"LORELAI: We like the entire house Kirk."
"KIRK: Really? Even that kitchen?"
"LORELAI: Thanks for coming over Kirk."
"KIRK: So what are you gonna do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know yet."
"KIRK: Oh, 'cause you don't wanna wait too long to address this."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I get that Kirk."
"KIRK: You might wanna get the dishes out of there."
"LORELAI: Good tip."
"KIRK: Thanks for the waffles."
"LORELAI: Thanks for the horrifying news."
"KIRK: Any time. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Look at it this way. The day's all uphill from here."
"RORY: This is really bad."
"LORELAI: Honey, don't worry. We'll figure something out."
"RORY: Okay. We should get inside."
"LORELAI: Yeah. After you."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Louise and Madeline sit at one end of a table counting out Fritos, Rory sits at the other end reading.]"
"LOUISE: Ten, eleven, twelve. Here."
"MADELINE: Thanks. One, Two, Three. . ."
"LOUISE: I'm depressed."
"MADELINE: Jeremy didn't call?"
"LOUISE: Not in a timely manner, no."
"MADELINE: Well, good riddance to bad luggage."
"LOUISE: I guess. I just thought we really connected the other day in the supply closet."
"MADELINE: Boys. A Nancy Drew mystery."
"[Paris sits down with her lunch tray]"
"PARIS: Louise, Madeline."
"LOUISE: You look happy."
"PARIS: Really? Huh."
"MADELINE: What?"
"PARIS: Nothing. It's just a nice day. A nice, nice day."
"MADELINE: Okay."
"PARIS: So, did you get your PSAT scores back yet?"
"MADELINE: Oh yeah, yesterday."
"PARIS: And?"
"MADELINE: 500 verbal, 560 math."
"PARIS: Respectable."
"MADELINE: I thought so."
"PARIS: Louise, what did you get?"
"LOUISE: Highlights, just around my face."
"PARIS: You will take them again and do better."
"LOUISE: I will take them again and get my nose done."
"PARIS: You don't study, you don't apply yourself."
"LOUISE: Blah, blah, blah. I need another chip."
"MADELINE: Take them."
"PARIS: So, I got my scores back today too."
"MADELINE: Oh yeah?"
"PARIS: This morning. I just came downstairs and there they were, just sitting on the table. Boy, was I nervous, just imagining what I got. But then I realized that I'd have to open them eventually, and so I did. And was I surprised by what I found. Could've knocked me over with a feather. Yup, I was just that surprised."
"RORY: So, what did you get?"
"PARIS: Well Rory, since you asked, and by the way I'm not bragging or anything, but I got a 750 math and a 730 verbal."
"MADELINE: Wow, that is good."
"LOUISE: Congratulations."
"PARIS: Thank you."
"RORY: Those are great scores."
"PARIS: So, did you get your scores back yet?"
"RORY: Yup."
"PARIS: And?"
"RORY: I'm happy."
"PARIS: How happy?"
"RORY: Pretty happy."
"PARIS: Yes, but how do I know that you're not one of those people who gets pretty happy looking at a sunset? How do I know what your barometer for being pretty happy is?"
"RORY: You don't."
"PARIS: Right. So are you?"
"RORY: Am I what?"
"PARIS: Are you one of those people who gets pretty happy looking at a sunset?"
"RORY: I don't get unhappy looking at a sunset."
"PARIS: What did you get?"
"RORY: That's personal."
"PARIS: Why won't you tell me?"
"RORY: 'Cause it's none of your business."
"PARIS: Okay, fine, don't tell me what you got."
"RORY: I won't."
"PARIS: Why won't you tell me your score?"
"RORY: Bye Paris."
"PARIS: You're not torturing me, you know. I don't care. My scores were great. I'm very, very happy with my scores. And I hate looking at a sunset so my standard for happiness is high!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[At nighttime, Lorelai goes into Rory's room and wakes her up.]"
"LORELAI: Rory, wake up."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LORELAI: I can hear them chewing."
"RORY: Who?"
"LORELAI: The termites. I hear them. They're everywhere, nibbling and eating and swallowing."
"RORY: You're insane."
"LORELAI: I can't sleep here."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: No, we have to go to Sookie's."
"RORY: You're kidding right?"
"LORELAI: Unh uh."
"RORY: It's eleven o'clock at night."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, here. But somewhere in the world it's still Miller time."
"RORY: Mom, you're wigging. Go put on some imaginary earplugs to drown out the imaginary termite sounds and go back to sleep."
"LORELAI: But -."
"RORY: Bed."
"LORELAI: But -."
"RORY: Now."
"LORELAI: But - ugh. You really don't hear them?"
"RORY: No, and as soon as you're asleep, you won't either."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine. Goodnight"
"RORY: Goodnight."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[That night, Lorelai and Rory are walking to Sookie's house.]"
"RORY: Ugh, I feel like they're crawling all over me."
"LORELAI: Ugh, I know, with their creepy little fangy teeth and their tail things and their pointy tentacles."
"RORY: You have no idea what a termite looks like, do you?"
"LORELAI: Hey, unless they're wearing a foundation repair guy T-shirt, I don't really care."
"RORY: Are you sure Sookie was up?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she answered the phone."
"RORY: After how many rings?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, twenty or thirty."
"RORY: Mom, she was sleeping."
"LORELAI: No, no, she's just deaf in one ear."
"RORY: Since when?"
"LORELAI: Now, apparently."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, you would have to be deaf in one ear not to hear the phone ring twenty or thirty times."
"[They ring the doorbell, Sookie answers]"
"SOOKIE: They're they are, my little termite whisperers."
"LORELAI: Hey Sookie, sorry to call so late."
"RORY: And so incessantly."
"LORELAI: Well I'm sorry, they were getting organized. I heard one of them yell charge."
"RORY: We will make this up to you Sookie."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about? This is great. It'll be like a slumber party."
"RORY: Are you sure?"
"SOOKIE: Absolutely. We can raid the fridge. We can make a nice avocado- mango face mask. Get out the tarot cards, tell fortunes, play Twister, make a Häagen-Dazs chocolate chocolate chip ice cream milkshake, and we'll watch Purple Rain. . ."
"LORELAI: Sookie, it's midnight."
"SOOKIE: Okay, let's go straight for the milkshakes."
"LORELAI: Good thinking."
"RORY: I'm gonna put my stuff in the guest room."
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"LORELAI: Sookie, I really appreciate you letting us crash here tonight. It was so creepy just lying there listening to a thousand tiny little insects just mocking me. 'Ha ha, we're eating your house, try and stop us.'"
"SOOKIE: When are you going to tent?"
"LORELAI: Next week."
"SOOKIE: Ugh, that sucks."
"LORELAI: Two thousand dollars."
"SOOKIE: That sucks."
"LORELAI: And after the two thousand dollar circus tent fiasco, I have to find another fifteen thousand dollars to keep my house from falling down."
"SOOKIE: Aw honey."
"LORELAI: I like that house."
"SOOKIE: I know you do."
"LORELAI: I don't want it to fall down."
"SOOKIE: I know you don't."
"LORELAI: So anyway, I called the bank today."
"SOOKIE: How did that go?"
"LORELAI: Well, it - wait, yeah, oh, what's that? Yeah, they're still laughing."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, they passed the phone around, made me ask everyone in the place."
"SOOKIE: That is terrible! Ugh, completely heartless."
"LORELAI: According to the jolly bankers, I'm worth nothing."
"SOOKIE: There still has to be something you can do."
"LORELAI: I was thinking about opening a Coyote Ugly lemonade stand."
"SOOKIE: Interesting."
"[Rory walks into the kitchen]"
"RORY: What's interesting?"
"LORELAI: Mm, nothing, nothing. Just that your mom is apparently one of the biggest losers in Stars Hollow."
"RORY: Okay, continue."
"SOOKIE: I think you should call them again tomorrow."
"LORELAI: No, uh, Sookie. . ."
"SOOKIE: No, I mean it. I mean, you're an upstanding citizen, you're an active part of the community."
"RORY: Yeah, you made all of the donkey outfits for the Christmas festival last year."
"SOOKIE: You organized the Save the Historic Oak Tree campaign."
"RORY: And you played Tevye in the, uh, Stars Hollow Community Theater production of Fiddler on the Roof."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, five and a half stars from the Stars Hollow Gazette, unheard of 'til that time."
"SOOKIE: They should take that into account."
"RORY: Yes, they should."
"LORELAI: Yes, they should, but they won't."
"[A noise comes from Sookie's closet.]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, uh, I bet there's a room at the inn you could stay in, part time at least."
"LORELAI: Sookie, what was that?"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: That noise."
"SOOKIE: What noise?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, a huge thud just came from your closet."
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah, that's my shoes."
"LORELAI: Your shoes?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, that's my shoe closet, and um, sometimes I don't, uh, stack them properly and then, uh, they fall and then there's a thudding sound and then, uh, no, you, uh, and that's probably the sound that you just heard. Ooh, the ice cream's getting, uh, melted so you better -."
"[Lorelai knocks on the closet door]"
"LORELAI: Jackson?"
"JACKSON: Yes?"
"LORELAI: How're you doing?"
"JACKSON: I'm doing fine, you?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson's hiding in the closet."
"SOOKIE: Yes he is."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you say something?"
"SOOKIE: Well, because you were upset and you were bringing Rory over and I didn't want her to feel weird or uncomfortable."
"LORELAI: So you stuck Jackson in the closet?"
"JACKSON: Yes she did."
"RORY: Jackson, come out."
"JACKSON: I'm in my pajamas."
"LORELAI: So are we."
"JACKSON: Yeah, but mine are humiliating."
"LORELAI: We won't laugh."
"JACKSON: Yes you will."
"RORY: I promise we won't."
"JACKSON: I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Well, are you gonna be fine in there all night 'cause that's how long we're staying - all night."
"RORY: And knowing Sookie, she's gonna make a big breakfast."
"LORELAI: That's right, so tonight will last until late tomorrow morning, so the bottom line for you here buddy is you're gonna be holed up in that closet a very, very long time."
"JACKSON: If I come out, you have to understand one thing."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"JACKSON: I have a cousin who owns a Xerox company that specializes in taking pictures and making them into things - calendars, coffee mugs, collector plates, and pajamas."
"LORELAI: Jackson's wearing picture pajamas?"
"SOOKIE: Yes he is."
"LORELAI: Does he do this often?"
"SOOKIE: Almost every night."
"RORY: What are the pictures of?"
"SOOKIE: Him."
"LORELAI: Oh!"
"SOOKIE: During high school."
"LORELAI: Ahh!"
"SOOKIE: In his wrestling uniform."
"LORELAI: Jackson, you have to come out here right now!"
"JACKSON: No."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"JACKSON: Because you sound too eager."
"LORELAI: I'm not eager, am I eager?"
"RORY: Put your paws down."
"LORELAI: Jackson, I'm not eager. I just want you to come out here and be comfortable, that's all."
"JACKSON: Well, okay."
"[Jackson opens the closet door]"
"LORELAI: Huh."
"SOOKIE: Okay, well honey, we're making milkshakes, you wanna come in and help?"
"JACKSON: Okay."
"LORELAI: [quietly to Rory] If our house does fall down and we end up living in a hollowed out tree, this moment might make it all worth it."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: Hello? Lane?"
"MRS. KIM: What are you doing here?"
"RORY: Mrs. Kim, hi. I was just - ."
"MRS. KIM: Out."
"RORY: What?"
"MRS. KIM: Out, out, out!"
"RORY: But I wiped off my feet."
"MRS. KIM: Move! Move!"
"[Mrs. Kim ushers Rory outside]"
"RORY: I was just looking for Lane and I thought that maybe she was - ."
"MRS. KIM: Taylor says you have termites."
"RORY: I don't have termites, my house does."
"MRS. KIM: You are a carrier."
"RORY: I don't think you can really be a termite carrier."
"MRS. KIM: You'll spread it all over town."
"RORY: Mrs. Kim, I swear, we don't control the termites. They move around on their own."
"MRS. KIM: See all the furniture in there? Wood, all wood. You must go. Go now!"
"RORY: Can you just tell me if Lane is home?"
"MRS. KIM: No."
"RORY: Well, do you know where she is?"
"MRS. KIM: School."
"RORY: Still?"
"MRS. KIM: Yes, still. She's there, she's studying. What's that moving by your foot?"
"RORY: What?"
"MRS. KIM: I see something moving by your foot."
"RORY: Nope, there's nothing, I swear."
"[Mrs. Kim sprays the hose near Rory's feet]"
"RORY: Agh! Will you tell her I came by?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai sits at the living room couch working on the computer. Rory walks over and sits near her.]"
"RORY: And then she chased me halfway down the street with the hose. It was like a scene from Silkwood."
"LORELAI: Ugh, news travels way too fast around here."
"RORY: Four people asked me when we were tenting, two people asked me if we were moving, and one person asked me if we were atheists."
"LORELAI: See, we have to stop talking to people. We have to stay at home with the curtains drawn collecting stacks of old newspapers, muttering to each other, eating nothing but Cup of Soup and Slim Jims."
"[phone rings, Rory answers]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"MADELINE: Hi Rory, it's Madeline."
"RORY: Oh, hi."
"MADELINE: Listen, I have to ask you a little favor."
"RORY: Okay."
"MADELINE: Well, see, I'm working on an article for the Franklin - totally last minute. But I thought it would be really interesting to compare Chilton's overall PSAT scores to other prep schools in the area."
"RORY: Uh huh."
"MADELINE: So I'm trying to compile a list of people's scores, especially the top students, and I realized I don't have yours yet."
"RORY: Oh, so you wanna know my PSAT scores?"
"MADELINE: Yes, that would be great."
"RORY: Put Paris on the phone."
"MADELINE: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Paris, let me talk to her."
"MADELINE: Oh, Paris isn't here. I don't know where she is. She's probably at her house, or maybe at the library, or maybe she's buying pencils because she goes through them so fast 'cause she pushes down on them really hard and then they break and . . ."
"RORY: Madeline."
"MADELINE: Hold on. [hands phone to Paris]"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Pathetic."
"PARIS: Why won't you tell me?"
"RORY: Bye Paris."
"PARIS: Tell me those scores, I have to know! Rory?"
"[Rory hangs up]"
"LORELAI: Paris again?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: God. You know, I think if we put Paris and my mother in a room together, the world would implode."
"RORY: I'll keep that in mind for the next science fair."
"LORELAI: Enough. Now I've got computer screens feeling sorry for me."
"RORY: Geez, how many places is that?"
"LORELAI: Aw honey, it's not the amount of places that turns you down that matters, it's the quality of the place that turns you down that matters. And when you've got Jacko's Loans and Stuff not wanting your business, you know it's time to hang out with the Coreys."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: It's okay. I won't think about it tonight. I'll think about it tomorrow - at Tara. You ready?"
"RORY: One sec. You know Mom, I hate to bring this up, but I think there's a really obvious solution to our problem."
"LORELAI: I know hon."
"RORY: You do?"
"LORELAI: Yes. And frankly, I think if I sold you into white slavery, I would miss you."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Rory, please don't go where you're going."
"RORY: I think they would say yes."
"LORELAI: Of course they would say yes. And that yes would be followed by, 'Okay, okay, enough already. My God, please stop. I'm a shell, I've got nothing left to give.'"
"RORY: That's not true."
"LORELAI: That is completely true."
"RORY: Grandma and Grandpa would wanna help."
"LORELAI: Rory, I went to my parents for you for Chilton. Why? Because that was worth all the obligation. This is not."
"RORY: This is our home."
"LORELAI: Yes, and I'll find a way to fix it."
"RORY: But how?"
"LORELAI: I don't know yet."
"RORY: Well if you don't know yet, then maybe there's not another way."
"LORELAI: There's always another way."
"RORY: Was there another way with Chilton?"
"LORELAI: That was different."
"RORY: Why was that different?"
"LORELAI: Because I said that was different and I'm the one doing the groveling and the groveling gets you judgment rights and I am judging that this is different."
"RORY: Well, the remaining judge begs to differ."
"LORELAI: Rory, I know you mean well, but I'm not gonna deal with my parents on this one, okay?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: You're being stubborn."
"LORELAI: Oh no, have I shocked you?"
"RORY: Fine, let's go."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the living room couch. Emily hands them each a drink, then sits down in the chair.]"
"RORY: So where's Grandpa tonight?"
"EMILY: He's at work."
"LORELAI: Mom, did you explain to him that part of the quitting process means you don't go back to the job you quit?"
"EMILY: He did not quit, he resigned."
"LORELAI: Hmm, same rules apply."
"EMILY: No, when you resign you have to put in a certain amount of time to get things in order. He has clients to see, certain accounts to close out."
"RORY: Is that hard for him?"
"EMILY: Actually, I think he's rather enjoying it."
"RORY: Well good."
"EMILY: Yes, it is good. [sees Lorelai taking a pill] What are you taking?"
"LORELAI: Roofies."
"RORY: Aspirin."
"EMILY: Are you getting sick?"
"LORELAI: No, I just have a headache."
"EMILY: Well having a headache means you're sick. You think it's normal to have a headache?"
"LORELAI: No, I just have a tension headache."
"EMILY: Well, what do you have to be tense about?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I can't begin to think."
"EMILY: You should lie down."
"LORELAI: I'm fine."
"EMILY: You work too hard."
"LORELAI: No, I don't."
"EMILY: If you didn't work so hard you wouldn't have a tension headache."
"LORELAI: It's not a work tension headache, Mom."
"EMILY: So then you are sick?"
"LORELAI: Actually, I am, I'm sick."
"EMILY: I knew it, what's wrong?"
"LORELAI: Consumption with a touch of the vapors. I'm going for a leeching tonight after coffee."
"RORY: She's got a case of exterminator-itis."
"EMILY: What's that mean?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"RORY: We have termites."
"EMILY: Oh that's terrible!"
"LORELAI: It's not so bad."
"RORY: They're eating our whole house."
"LORELAI: But they always say thank you."
"EMILY: What does that mean, they're eating your whole house?"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Well, we found out that we have all these foundation problems and it's going to be very expensive to fix and Mom can't get a loan."
"LORELAI: That is not true."
"RORY: You've been turned down by five banks."
"LORELAI: Hey, I made up Jacko's Loans and Stuff."
"RORY: Fine, four banks."
"[Emily walks over to a desk and sits down. Lorelai follows her.]"
"LORELAI: Mom, uh, wait. What are you doing?"
"EMILY: I'm writing you a check."
"LORELAI: No you're not. Okay, hold on here."
"EMILY: How much do you need?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"EMILY: Don't be ridiculous, just tell me how much."
"LORELAI: I can handle this."
"EMILY: It doesn't sound like you can handle it."
"LORELAI: Well, I can."
"EMILY: Fine, if you won't tell me how much, I'll leave the amount blank and you can fill it in later."
"LORELAI: Mom, stop. [takes Emily's pen out of her hand and walks back to the couch]"
"EMILY: You took my pen!"
"LORELAI: Mom, I appreciate the thought, but I don't need your money."
"EMILY: So you'd rather have your house fall down then let your mother help you?"
"LORELAI: Mom, the house is not gonna fall down. Let's not make this a big issue. Let's just sit down and have a drink and have dinner, okay?"
"EMILY: All right."
"LORELAI: Thank you"
"EMILY: Are you going to give me back my pen?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, after dinner."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door.]"
"RORY: Mom, stop it. Talk to me. [Lorelai ignores her and goes upstairs] It's been two hours since you've even looked in my direction."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai walks in and starts cleaning off her bed. Rory walks in a few seconds later]"
"RORY: Okay, I get it, you're mad."
"LORELAI: Rory, I do not want to talk about this right now."
"ORY: You were just being stubborn."
"LORELAI: Go to bed."
"RORY: Well you didn't want to ask for help, so I did."
"LORELAI: Hey, do you remember the conversation we had before we left this house tonight?"
"RORY: Yes, but -."
"LORELAI: I told you going to my parents was not an option."
"RORY: I know, but -."
"LORELAI: In fact, I told you several times that asking my parents was not an option. Now yes, I might have made a few quips to lighten the subject matter, but I still think I made my point pretty damn clear."
"RORY: Fine, but we have a real problem here."
"LORELAI: Oh, you think I don't know that? You think I sit around all day swapping witticisms with Robert Benchley at the Algonquin? No! I am thinking and worrying and using the computer and I hate using the computer!"
"RORY: Which is exactly why I brought this up."
"LORELAI: You had no right to bring it up!"
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because I told you not to, that's why!"
"RORY: But -."
"LORELAI: No, there are no buts! There will be no buts here! There's 'I'm sorry Mom', there's 'I screwed up Mom', there's 'I'll never do it again Mom', but there are no buts!"
"RORY: But -."
"LORELAI: Out!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Go to bed. We're done."

"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Rory sits on the front steps reading. From behind, Dean throws a basketball towards her]"
"DEAN: Think fast! Very good."
"RORY: You threw a basketball at my head."
"DEAN: No, I threw a basketball past your head."
"RORY: What if I had turned around when you said that?"
"DEAN: Then you might've caught it, thereby completing the whole 'think fast' equation."
"RORY: I don't catch basketballs."
"DEAN: Duly noted."
"RORY: I don't even like basketballs."
"DEAN: Okay, I'm very sorry."
"RORY: In fact, out of all the sporting balls in the world, the basketball is probably my least favorite."
"DEAN: Rory."
"RORY: They're round and hard."
"DEAN: Rory."
"RORY: And they're orange."
"DEAN: And you do realize how insane you sound right now?"
"RORY: Yes."
"DEAN: Okay, just checking."
"RORY: I'm sorry, I'm in a horrible mood."
"DEAN: Hadn't noticed."
"RORY: It's just, we've had fights before."
"DEAN: You and me?"
"RORY: Me and Mom."
"DEAN: Ah."
"RORY: But this one is particularly crazy. I mean, we have a situation here and she's being so stubborn."
"DEAN: Huh."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: What what?"
"RORY: What was with the huh?"
"DEAN: Nothing."
"RORY: No, there was a meaning behind that huh. That was a loaded huh. That was not a normal huh. You meant to say something with that huh, and now you're taking it back."
"DEAN: Okay, now. . ."
"RORY: Don't use that kind of huh if you're not prepared to defend it. Why aren't you saying anything?"
"DEAN: Because words are a very dangerous thing right now."
"RORY: You were saying that I'm stubborn just like my mother."
"DEAN: I was saying that in addition to all of the wonderful amazing qualities that the two of you share there is possibly, on occasion, a similar tendency to dig your heels in."
"RORY: I hate it when we fight."
"DEAN: I know."
"RORY: She was so mad."
"DEAN: Well you'll make up. You wanna get a coffee?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"DEAN: All right, I'll go get my ball."
"[As Dean walks away, some cheerleaders walk out of the school. Rory sees that Lane is one of them. They make eye contact and quickly look away as Dean returns with a flattened ball.]"
"DEAN: If it makes you feel any better, a car ran over it."
"RORY: I need to get coffee now."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks through the lobby talking on the phone]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mr. Regalsky, it's Lorelai Gilmore. Again, yes, just like the pink bunny with the drum. Uh, anyway, I was wondering if, um, you have had a chance to reconsider my loan? . . . Uh, no, I think it's Energizer. . . I know you said no, but um, you know sometimes people say no and then they wake up one morning a couple of days later and think, 'Hey, maybe I shouldn't have turned down that nice single mom with the good job and the great credentials and the references up the wazoo' . . . I do like the word wazoo. . . I understand. . .Okay, well, I'll give you a call in a couple of days then. . . Thank you. [hangs up]"
"MICHEL: Perhaps you are taking the wrong approach."
"LORELAI: Meaning?"
"MICHEL: Well, you've tried to convince them of your virtue, perhaps it's time to offer them a lap dance. You didn't."
"LORELAI: I was kidding, sort of."
"MICHEL: Oh dear."
"LORELAI: Well I have to do something and I'm not sure exactly where to draw the line."
"MICHEL: You know in Thailand, women do this trick with a Ping-Pong ball that is a big crowd pleaser."
"LORELAI: Line drawn, thank you."
"[phone rings, Michel answers]"
"MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Ah, yes. She is right here. [hands phone to Lorelai] Your mother."
"LORELAI: Hi mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai, I called to tell you I talked to Miles Hahn today."
"LORELAI: Well, that sounds very nice, I'm glad."
"EMILY: You have any idea who Miles Hahn is?"
"LORELAI: Not a bit."
"EMILY: He's the president of the First National Bank. We've been doing business with him for years. He's become a very dear friend of ours actually."
"LORELAI: What does that have to do with me Mom?"
"EMILY: Well, I brought up your little dilemma to him."
"LORELAI: Oh boy."
"EMILY: And he told me that if you were in the mood to come talk to him, you could feel free to do so. On Thursday, at 3:15."
"LORELAI: So you wrangled me a meeting at your bank?"
"EMILY: I asked a friend for advice."
"LORELAI: What else did you ask him for Mom?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, I simply asked a man to talk to you. What you talk about or what comes out of that talk is strictly up to you."
"LORELAI: Well, thanks Mom, but I'm fine."
"EMILY: So you got a loan?"
"LORELAI: I got a lead."
"EMILY: A lead on a loan?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: How nice. Now if you could just get an actual loan."
"LORELAI: Okay Mom, I gotta get back to work."
"EMILY: Thursday at 3:15."
"LORELAI: Mom, tell your friend thank you, but I'm afraid I won't be able to make it."
"EMILY: He'll be there whether you show up or not, it's up to you. All I did was make an appointment Lorelai, that's all."
"LORELAI: Great. Bye Mom. [hangs up, then dials a number] Hi, Mr. Regalsky please? It's Lorelai Gilmore. . . Oh, I just spoke to him five minutes ago. . . . When do you expect him back from France?"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE LUKE'S"
"[Rory and Dean walk out of the diner.]"
"DEAN: Okay, so uh, I'll call you later."
"RORY: Thanks for the coffee."
"DEAN: You're welcome. [they kiss] Bye."
"RORY: Bye. [Rory kisses him again] That's for me not thinking fast."
"DEAN: Please never think fast again."
"RORY: I'll try my hardest."
"[Dean walks away. Rory sees Lane across the street, and they walk towards each other.]"
"LANE: We need to talk."
"RORY: Okay, let's talk. Nice outfit."
"LANE: Thank you."
"RORY: So I guess this is why you've been AWOL for the past couple of weeks?"
"LANE: Pretty much."
"RORY: So what, you just had the urge to stand on top of another girl's shoulders?"
"LANE: Don't be like that."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LANE: Like you're being. It makes it impossible to tell you."
"RORY: You didn't tell me."
"LANE: I know."
"RORY: Why?"
"LANE: Because."
"RORY: Okay, have you ever thought of being a prosecutor because I think you've got real potential."
"LANE: I didn't tell you because I knew you'd act like this."
"RORY: No, I'm acting like this because you didn't tell me."
"LANE: Oh, so if I'd come up to you and I'd said, 'Rory, I'm wanna become a cheerleader,' you would've said. . ."
"RORY: Why?"
"LANE: Exactly."
"RORY: Exactly what? Lane, this is weird. I mean, we always used to make fun of cheerleaders. You and I, we would rag on Janie Fertman and hide during pep rallies and now all of a sudden, you're peppy."
"LANE: I'm not peppy."
"RORY: Well you look peppy."
"LANE: Look, you're not around much anymore."
"RORY: Oh, so this is my fault?"
"LANE: And you have Dean."
"RORY: So this is his fault?"
"LANE: It's just . . .I don't know. I don't know why. I just wanted to do it. I just wanted to try it, and I don't feel like I should have to justify it to you or explain it to you or..."
"RORY: Then don't!"
"LANE: Fine I won't."
"RORY: Okay."
"LANE: All right. I forgot my pom."
"RORY: Your what?"
"LANE: Two are pompoms, one's a pom!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Out front, Luke is lying halfway under the porch as Lorelai sits nearby]"
"LORELAI: Well, how's it look?"
"LUKE: It's dark. Hand me the flashlight."
"LORELAI: Why don't you have one of those hats with the lights on them?"
"LUKE: I flip burgers for a living."
"LORELAI: Right, right."
"LUKE: Okay. I think I've seen enough. [comes out from under the porch]"
"LORELAI: Well how was it? Was there like a termite housing development under there? Golf courses and condos with rec rooms?"
"LUKE: It's actually not too bad."
"LORELAI: Well what do you know? You flip burgers for a living."
"LUKE: I mean, there's definitely a little damage."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but Kirk says that the joists were totally gone."
"LUKE: Yeah, they are."
"LORELAI: And that the foundation has lost all its structural integrity."
"LUKE: That's true too."
"LORELAI: Okay great, so I'm still screwed."
"LUKE: Not necessarily."
"LORELAI: Luke, I need fifteen thousand dollars which I can't find, don't have, and if I don't find, the house is gonna fall down."
"LUKE: I can help you with that."
"LORELAI: You can?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I can get a couple guys, we can get in there and do the work."
"LORELAI: You can fix this?"
"LUKE: Well, I can help. I know a good contractor. He did some work on the diner."
"LORELAI: What about the money?"
"LUKE: Um, you won't have to deal with that right away."
"LORELAI: I won't?"
"LUKE: No, you can pay it out in installments if you want. Monthly, bimonthly, whatever - whatever you're comfortable with."
"LORELAI: So, let me get this straight. Uh, you and some guys who actually know what they're doing are gonna come over and fix my house, and I can pay them back whenever I want?"
"LUKE: That's right."
"LORELAI: 'Cause I'm Tony Soprano?"
"LUKE: Only scarier."
"LORELAI: Now Luke, when I finally do make out this installment check, uh, who should I make it out to?"
"LUKE: Well, you can make it out to me if you like."
"LORELAI: Oh, so basically you would be fronting me the money?"
"LUKE: Well, yeah, but it's no big deal."
"LORELAI: Luke, that's a loan."
"LUKE: No, it's just a temporary exchange of money for services that will be paid back when you finally have the. . . it's a loan."
"LORELAI: Man, you suck as a liar. Thank you."
"LUKE: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: I can't take it."
"LUKE: I know, but it was worth a sh*t."
"[Rory walks up the porch steps]"
"LORELAI: Hey, uh, Dean called twice."
"RORY: Rah, rah, rah. [goes into the house]"
"LUKE: You two. . ."
"LORELAI: Don't ask."
"LUKE: Okay. So what are you gonna do?"
"CUT TO FIRST NATIONAL BANK"
"[Lorelai enters the bank and walks up to a woman]"
"LORELAI: Oh, excuse me, could you tell me where Mr. Hahn's office is?"
"WOMAN: Yeah, it's right there."
"LORELAI: Oh, thank you."
"[Lorelai walks towards the office, but stops when she sees Emily]"
"LORELAI: You are not seriously sitting there."
"EMILY: No, it's a hologram. Lifelike, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Mom, why are you here?"
"EMILY: I just wanted to see if you'd show up."
"LORELAI: I did."
"EMILY: I see."
"LORELAI: Mom, you said you made this appointment for me. Not you, me."
"EMILY: I did. But I know Miles and I thought my presence in there would - ."
"LORELAI: Ooh, ooh. In where?"
"EMILY: In the meeting."
"LORELAI: Okay. Bye."
"EMILY: Where are you going? Come back here. Lorelai!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai walks out of the bank with Emily following her]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, stop. Will you stop already?"
"LORELAI: I'm leaving Mom."
"EMILY: Why, because I'm here?"
"LORELAI: This is a business meeting. I'm not going in there with my Mommy, especially since I left my blankie at home."
"EMILY: You're being stubborn and short sided."
"LORELAI: Call it whatever you want."
"EMILY: I don't understand why you would let your silly pride keep you from fixing your home."
"LORELAI: I don't understand why you can't physically stop yourself from butting in where you don't belong."
"EMILY: I made this appointment."
"LORELAI: Against my will."
"EMILY: You needed it."
"LORELAI: I didn't ask for it."
"EMILY: Lorelai, this man can solve your problems, don't you understand that?"
"LORELAI: Fine. I'll go in, you go home."
"EMILY: I can't go home now, his assistant already knows I'm here. It would be rude."
"LORELAI: Okay, here's the deal. We will both go in. You will go in that room but you will not say a word."
"EMILY: What? But I couldn't possibly just - ."
"LORELAI: You'll say hello, you'll ask how his wife is, and that's it. After that, you will say nothing, you will do nothing, you will sit in the corner and offer no opinions and pull a full-on Clarence Thomas, am I making myself perfectly clear?"
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: It's the only way I'm doing this, Mom."
"EMILY: All right, I'll be quiet. I will, I promise."
"LORELAI: I swear, one of these days, Alice. Pow! Right to the moon."
"EMILY: What on earth are you talking about? Who's Alice?"
"CUT TO INSIDE BANK"
"[Lorelai and Emily walk back into the bank.]"
"MILES: Oh, there you are. I thought you were here, I come out and you were gone."
"EMILY: Oh, well, we left something in the car."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, she left something in the car, not me. I never leave anything in the car 'cause that would be irresponsible and forgetful, two things which I am not."
"EMILY: Miles, this is my daughter Lorelai."
"MILES: Well hello. It's a thrill to finally meet you."
"LORELAI: Same here, thank you."
"MILES: Would you two like some coffee?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Coffee would be wonderful, thank you."
"MILES: Coming right up. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Hi, what happened to you not saying anything?"
"EMILY: Accepting coffee is merely being sociable. Besides, I haven't asked how his wife is yet."
"[Miles walks back]"
"MILES: Okay, coffee's on its way. Why don't we go on in and sit down?"
"EMILY: That would be lovely."
"CUT TO INSIDE OFFICE [The three of them walk in and sit down.]"
"MILES: So I understand that Richard's retiring."
"EMILY: Yes, he's going to be a man of leisure."
"MILES: Well, how nice. Any big plans?"
"EMILY: Actually, an around the world trip has been discussed."
"LORELAI: Really? Any dates set?"
"EMILY: No, not yet."
"LORELAI: Just checking."
"[the secretary brings in the coffee]"
"MILES: Ah, Marnie, thank you. So I guess we should probably get down to business. Lorelai, your mother tells me you're having a little trouble finding a loan."
"LORELAI: Yes I am. Um, you know, before we talk about this - it's so funny - my mom has just been dying to ask you how your wife is doing. Right mom?"
"EMILY: Yes, how is Sheryl?"
"MILES: Why, she's fine."
"LORELAI: Okay, good, now that we got that out of the way, about my situation."
"MILES: Well, Emily tells me that you have termites."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do. And unfortunately they have damaged the foundation of my house."
"MILES: That could be terrible. I remember when you and Richard had that foundation problem a couple years ago. What, you had a flood in your basement, wasn't that it?"
"EMILY: Well, actually -."
"LORELAI: You know, Mr. Hahn, I appreciate you taking the time to meet with me today, and I know that the only reason you did is because of my mother, but she's really here today as a kind of silent participant. Uh, not even actually a participant, just a  silent. Um, so I would appreciate it if you would treat me just like any other person who was walking in off the street and asking for a loan."
"MILES: Oh, well, of course. If that's what you'd like."
"LORELAI: It is, thank you. Now, I've brought, um, all my previous loan documents and also my bank statements, numerous recommendations including a letter from my employer which just basically says that she's not gonna fire me before you get your money back."
"MILES: Oh, you've taken out two previous loans on this house?"
"LORELAI: Um, yes."
"MILES: And this is the estimated worth of the house?"
"LORELAI: Well, uh, yes."
"MILES: And this is the amount in your savings account?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"MILES: Any other accounts not listed here?"
"LORELAI: No."
"MILES: Any other collateral not listed here?"
"LORELAI: No."
"MILES: Well Ms. Gilmore, I'm sorry, I can't help you."
"LORELAI: Uh, that's it? So fast? You didn't even look at the letters of recommendation."
"MILES: Well I'm sure you're a well liked person, Ms. Gilmore. Unfortunately being well liked is not grounds for granting a loan."
"LORELAI: Oh, but I am good for the money. I, uh, pay off all my debts and I work really hard. I've been the executive manager of the Independence Inn for the last four years now."
"MILES: Ms. Gilmore, this is not a reflection of you as a person. It's simply a case where you don't have what the bank requires of every other person off the street to qualify for a loan. Therefore, there's nothing I can do."
"LORELAI: Well now, just think about this because, uh, I have a kid and she's gotten awfully used to the whole concept of having a roof over her head."
"MILES: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: I can't leave without this loan."
"MILES: Well, I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: No, I mean it. I can't leave without knowing there's a way that I can save my house, so I'm just asking you to take five minutes and think of something, anything that I can do to get this money."
"MILES: Well, you can get someone to cosign the loan with you."
"LORELAI: That's it? That's my only option?"
"MILES: I'm afraid so."
"LORELAI: You knew about this, didn't you? Mom?"
"EMILY: Hm?"
"LORELAI: Would you be willing. . ."
"EMILY: It would be my pleasure."
"MILES: Wonderful. I'll have the papers drawn up today. Would you like some more coffee?"
"EMILY: I would love some, thank you."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Emily walk out of the bank]"
"EMILY: Well, I think that went very well."
"LORELAI: So what's the new arrangement gonna be?"
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Well, you helped me pay for Chilton, I gave you Friday night dinners, so what's this, Sunday night tea?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, I did this for your own good."
"LORELAI: Wednesday night bridge club?"
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Monday night football?"
"EMILY: Stop it!"
"LORELAI: What Mom? Just please tell me, what do I owe you?"
"EMILY: You owe me nothing. I just wanted to do something nice for my daughter, that's all."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[A nighttime pep rally is being held in front of Stars Hollow High.]"
"TAYLOR: It's already shaping up to be the best season ever, due in part to the recent arrival of our brand new basketball coach Lou Magillian, formerly the presiding legal counsel for the Chicago Bulls. Lou, come on up here and take a bow. Those other teams had better watch out, we've got one of the big boys on our side now, huh? Shaq who? And in addition to our new coach, we're extremely proud of our brand new uniforms, thoughtfully supplied by you, the citizens of Stars Hollow, and carefully cleaned by the good people at Tricky's Dry Cleaners. If it's sticky, try Tricky's. Let's hear it for Tricky! I'm telling you, they are terrific. Red and white, very durable, little stripes on the side - oh you know what, why don't you just see for yourselves. Come on, show 'em your uniforms."
"PLAYER: Mr. Doose, it's freezing out here. Why don't you let 'em see it at the game?"
"TAYLOR: Young man, the people in this town paid good money for those uniforms. Now you show them what they paid for."
"PLAYER: This is crazy."
"TAYLOR: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the new uniforms of the fabulous fighting Minutemen."
"[cut to Rory standing in the crowd next to Bootsy]"
"BOOTSY: Oh look at them shivering up there. They're such wimps these days. When I was on the team, it was different. We were rowdy. Three of us would've been pantsed by now."
"[Bootsy walks away and Lorelai walks over]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Oh hey."
"LORELAI: I got your note."
"RORY: Yeah, well pinning it to the Mallomars is always a safe bet."
"LORELAI: Oh, coffee?"
"RORY: Please."
"LORELAI: So, um, Grandma and I went to the bank today."
"RORY: How'd it go?"
"LORELAI: We got the loan."
"RORY: Good. So then everything's okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, well. Wow, nice uniforms."
"RORY: I'm sorry I told Grandma about it."
"LORELAI: Aw hon, listen, there's gonna be a time in our lives where occasionally I'm gonna make a mistake. It hasn't happened yet, but it might."
"RORY: Sure."
"LORELAI: But I have earned the right to make that mistake, and I have earned the right to fix any problems without interference."
"RORY: I just thought that they could help."
"LORELAI: But I didn't want their help"
"RORY: But -."
"LORELAI: Rory, have you ever been without food or clothes or books or book covers for that matter or anything else you ever needed?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: No, and see, the reason for that is me. I have a pretty good track record for keeping you alive."
"RORY: Yeah, you do."
"LORELAI: So when I tell you I can handle something, you need to respect that, especially since you have no evidence proving I won't. Understand?"
"RORY: Yeah, I understand. I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: I officially declare this fight over."
"RORY: I'll drink to that."
"[The cheerleaders run out and start their routine]"
"LORELAI: Is that Lane?"
"RORY: Yeah, that's Lane."
"LORELAI: Hah."
"[The cheerleaders finish their routine]"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[After the Pep Rally, Rory walks up to Lane.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LANE: Hi."
"RORY: So the music selection, yours I assume?"
"LANE: Yeah, there was a bit of an education process going on."
"RORY: I liked it. Very John Waters."
"LANE: Thank you."
"RORY: I don't want you to think that you can't tell me things."
"LANE: I don't wanna not tell you thing."
"RORY: And this whole cheerleading thing"
"LANE: I know it's weird."
"RORY: No, it's not that weird. I mean, if you were doing it professionally, then it would be weird. But this, it looked fun."
"LANE: It was fun."
"RORY: And hey, you got them to cheer to Madness, so there must be some hope left in the world."
"LANE: I want you rest assured that I remain me. I mean, Nico-obsessed, Exene wannabe with forty Korean bibles under her bed. I just bounce a little more."
"RORY: So can cheerleaders get coffee?"
"LANE: Oh yeah, coffee's a must."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LANE: Keeps you perky."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner]"
"LORELAI: So Mom, they started work on the house yesterday."
"EMILY: Oh, good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, these guys come at like the crack of dawn and all of a sudden there's all this hammering and drilling and dust flying everywhere."
"RORY: It's pretty impressive actually."
"LORELAI: They're a nice bunch too. And the best part is I've been out there like ten times to bring them coffee and I haven't seen a butt crack yet."
"EMILY: How nice. They should paint that slogan on their truck. Excuse me."
"LORELAI: Where you going?"
"EMILY: To get some more bread. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: I think I'll go help."
"RORY: I think that would be good."
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"LORELAI: Mom, I want to apologize to you."
"EMILY: For what?"
"LORELAI: Ah, for doubting your motives in this whole loan thing. I'm just not used to people doing things without strings attached, that's all."
"EMILY: By people, you mean me."
"LORELAI: I don't know what I would've done without your help. I mean it. I was out of ideas and then out of the blue you make this call and cosign the loan with me. I'm really, really grateful."
"EMILY: Well, that almost sounded sincere."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I should've left off one of the reallys. That always tips it."
"EMILY: All right, I accept your apology."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"EMILY: By the way, I'm going to be having my DAR meetings at the inn from now on. I hope you don't mind. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: She's good."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory have just arrived]"
"LORELAI: Thanks. Man, is it cold out there."
"RORY: I know, I'm freezing."
"EMILY: Well, come on in and sit by the fire. I'll make you both a drink and then we can talk."
"RORY: About what?"
"LORELAI: Antennas up."
"RORY: Aye aye, captain."
"[they walk to the living room]"
"EMILY: So Lorelai, how are you?"
"LORELAI: Um, I'm fine Mom."
"EMILY: Rory?"
"RORY: I'm fine too, Grandma."
"LORELAI: How are you Mom?"
"EMILY: Also fine."
"LORELAI: Oh, look at that. All three of us fine, just like the Judds."
"EMILY: So Lorelai, are you dating?"
"LORELAI: Uh, hm, no, I'm not dating."
"EMILY: Really? There's no one at all?"
"LORELAI: No, totally single."
"EMILY: Any chance you'd get back with Max?"
"LORELAI: No Mom, there's no chance."
"EMILY: What about the man at the diner, the one who refuses to shave?"
"LORELAI: Luke, he's just a friend Mom."
"EMILY: Do you think you'll be single your entire life?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: I mean, in terms of your finding someone, what do you think the odds are?"
"LORELAI: Okay, what is going on?"
"EMILY: Well, I visited the family mausoleum today."
"LORELAI: Never what you think it's gonna be!"
"EMILY: I just wanted to check on things, make sure they were keeping it up, changing the flowers, you know."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"EMILY: So I went inside and looked around and it occurred to me that there's a very limited space there."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"EMILY: Now of course there's a slot open for me and Richard and you and Rory, but after the two of you  that's it. No more room for anyone else."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"EMILY: Yes. So if you actually do meet someone someday, I don't know where to put him."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe we could just dump him at the local pool hall."
"EMILY: Don't be silly."
"LORELAI: No, because this is definitely not a conversation for that."
"EMILY: I looked into expanding into the crypt next door but the family that owns it wouldn't even discuss it with me."
"RORY: I'm getting a little creeped out here."
"EMILY: So I talked to the head of the cemetery and he suggested that we buy an annex."
"RORY: An annex?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: You know, like an outlet store, it would specialize in the irregular family members."
"EMILY: So if we do get the annex and you do eventually someday get married"
"LORELAI: Mom, just say it  fat chance  will you?"
"EMILY: I just meant that we'll have to decide who to move."
"LORELAI: Oh, oh. Well, uh. . .ugh, why don't we move Aunt Cecile? She was always so annoying at parties. She loved the knock-knock jokes."
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: You can't just kick out Aunt Cecile."
"LORELAI: Knock-knock. Who's there? Pineapple. Pineapple who? That's where it ended. Never fully grasped the knock-knock concept."
"EMILY: She was a complete idiot. Okay, it's decided  Cecile goes."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: Look - put me in the annex."
"LORELAI: Unh uh. No way. You are not leaving me alone in there with Cecile."
"RORY: Well I'm not gonna be held responsible for somebody being kicked out of their eternal resting place."
"LORELAI: Ooh, I have an idea. I'll probably go first, right? So when Rory kicks, just throw her in with me."
"RORY: I'd like my own space if you don't mind."
"LORELAI: Why? It'd totally be fun to be there together. Plus I plan to be buried with all the good CD's and my rock star belt."
"[Richard comes down the steps]"
"RICHARD: Sorry I'm late. What did I miss?"
"EMILY: We were just discussing who to move to the annex."
"RICHARD: Oh. I vote for Cecile. Horrible woman, and those terrible jokes."
"LORELAI: What'd I tell you?"
"RORY: This is a cold, cold family."
"[Opening Credits]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Later that night, Lorelai, Rory, Richard, and Emily are at the table eating dinner.]"
"LORELAI: This is really good."
"RORY: Yeah, what is it?"
"EMILY: Well, it -."
"LORELAI: No, don't tell us."
"RORY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because every time in my life that I've tasted something great but I didn't know what it was, it turned out to be something really disgusting that had I known what I was eating I never would've tried it in the first place."
"RORY: Example?"
"LORELAI: Snails."
"RORY: Gross."
"LORELAI: Eat in ignorance and enjoy it, my friend."
"RORY: Gladly."
"LORELAI: So Dad, how's the retired life treating you?"
"RICHARD: Well, fascinating actually. I find myself noticing things, everyday things that I must've witnessed a hundred times before but just walked right past. Like yesterday, your mother moved a vase, the one in the hall, and she didn't do it in front of me."
"LORELAI: Oh no, cause nice girls never move vases in front of men."
"RICHARD: And she only moved it a little but as I passed it by I noticed it had been moved."
"RORY: Impressive."
"RICHARD: And every day's a new discovery. Your mother changed her hair. Or she wore shoes that didn't match her purse."
"EMILY: Richard."
"RICHARD: Last Thursday."
"EMILY: Oh, for heaven's sake."
"RICHARD: You know what else I noticed?"
"RORY: What?"
"RICHARD: A first edition Flaubert, mint condition, shoved behind several of my Churchill biographies."
"RORY: No!"
"RICHARD: Interested?"
"RORY: My life is good."
"RICHARD: Follow me."
"LORELAI: Ooh Dad, see if you can find a pair of the new Chanel patent leather pirate boots stuffed back behind your Churchills."
"RICHARD: Hmm."
"[Richard and Rory leave the room]"
"LORELAI: What's up Mom?"
"EMILY: Nothing's up."
"LORELAI: You were twitching. I saw you."
"EMILY: You did not see me twitching."
"LORELAI: Mom, when Dad was talking about the vase, you were pulling a full-on Tabitha."
"EMILY: I did not pull a Tabitha."
"LORELAI: Something wrong?"
"EMILY: No, nothing's wrong."
"LORELAI: Hm, okay, nothing's wrong."
"EMILY: It's just that things are a little strange lately."
"LORELAI: What is?"
"EMILY: Having him home."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"EMILY: We've never really been home at the same time. I mean, we got married, we went to Europe, we came back, he went to work, and it's been that way ever since."
"LORELAI: Well, so now it's different."
"EMILY: It's very different. He's always here  watching me and noticing when I move a vase and. . .I don't know. It's silly. So he noticed my hair was different. Women die for that sort of thing."
"LORELAI: Aw Mom, it's just an adjustment. You've had your routine, he's had his routine. You guys just need to figure out a new routine."
"EMILY: I guess so."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it'll just take some time. Then you'll find your rhythm and he'll go back to ignoring your hair, all will be well."
"EMILY: Yes, you're probably right."
"LORELAI: Mm, I am right. Okay, I give. What is this?"
"EMILY: Sweetbreads."
"LORELAI: Sweetbreads. So that's uh. . ."
"EMILY: Pancreas."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[At a meeting of the Franklin, Paris is going through a stack of stories that people have submitted.]"
"PARIS: No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: I'm not done."
"RORY: Sorry."
"PARIS: No."
"LOUISE: Glad she finished that one."
"PARIS: Why am I the only one who cares?"
"RORY: You're not the only one who cares."
"PARIS: No. I know you care, but I need everyone in this stupid room to care because I can't be the only one to care. Besides you."
"LOUISE: It's just a contest Paris. It's not like you get a car or a lifetime supply of Rice a Roni."
"MADELINE: God, I love that stuff."
"PARIS: The Oppenheimer Award for Excellence in school journalism is not a contest. It's a statement. It says you're the best. The best writers, the best reporters, the best editors. It says that you have crushed all others who have dared to take you on. It says that every other single school in the United States of America is feeling nothing but shame and defeat and pain because of the people who won the Oppenheimer plaque. I wanna be those people, I wanna cause that pain."
"RORY: Our paper is good."
"PARIS: Not good enough."
"RORY: Last week's issue - ."
"PARIS: Was a fine effort by a bunch of kids."
"MADELINE: We are a bunch of kids."
"PARIS: Not when we're in this room, we're not. Flescher Prep Gazette, Broadmouth Banner, Richmond Heights Chronicle - these publications are not our competition."
"LOUISE: Geez."
"PARIS: The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post - these publications are our competition."
"MADELINE: Paris has gone bye-bye."
"PARIS: We need to raise the bar. We need to be better, think harder, dig deeper. I don't wanna just submit a good issue. I wanna submit a great issue, the best issue."
"RORY: When's the deadline?"
"PARIS: One week from today."
"RORY: Okay, so, then we better get brainstorming. Doe anyone have an idea for a theme?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: The one that wins."
"RORY: Okay, good, big help. All right everyone, we should get working. You're going to give yourself a stroke one of these days, you know that."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily walks through the hall into the living room.]"
"EMILY: Graciela, I'm leaving the shopping list on the table here. And remember we need the low sudsing detergent. I have drawn a picture of what the box looks like, so for heaven's sake pay attention this time."
"[Richard walks in]"
"EMILY: How was your walk?"
"RICHARD: Carl Lambertson needs a new roof. I'm going to drop him a note."
"EMILY: Good idea."
"RICHARD: Busy day?"
"EMILY: Mm, very."
"RICHARD: Is that the same cup of coffee you had when I left?"
"EMILY: What?"
"RICHARD: When I left an hour ago, you were having a cup of coffee."
"EMILY: Oh, no, this is a different cup of coffee."
"RICHARD: So then that's your third cup of coffee this morning?"
"EMILY: I guess."
"RICHARD: Interesting. I just realized you have three cups of coffee in the morning."
"EMILY: I don't drink three cups of coffee every morning."
"RICHARD: Every morning this week."
"EMILY: Well, so what?"
"RICHARD: Nothing. Just an observation, that's all. That's a lot of coffee to drink early in the morning."
"EMILY: Any thoughts on what you'd like for dinner tonight?"
"RICHARD: Oh no, anything's fine."
"EMILY: All right. [writes something down in her day planner]"
"RICHARD: What are you writing down?"
"EMILY: Lamb chops."
"RICHARD: Is that for tonight?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"RICHARD: Oh."
"EMILY: Do you not want lamb chops tonight?"
"RICHARD: Oh, no no, lamb chops is just fine for tonight. I just thought a nice roast would also be nice for a change."
"EMILY: Roast it is."
"RICHARD: Of course, if you want lamb chops "
"EMILY: We're having roast, Richard."
"RICHARD: Okay, if that's what you want."
"EMILY: I'm going by the dry cleaners, anything you want me to drop off?"
"RICHARD: You're going to the dry cleaners?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"RICHARD: Well I'll go with you."
"EMILY: I can bring in whatever you have."
"RICHARD: I know, but it'd be nice to go together."
"EMILY: That would be terribly romantic, but I won't have time to get back here before my DAR meeting so it's probably better if I go alone. You can come to the cleaners with me next week."
"RICHARD: Well yes, well I can go to the meeting with you."
"EMILY: You want to go to my meeting of the Daughters of the American Revolution?"
"RICHARD: Well, well yes, I think it'd be fascinating."
"EMILY: But I go straight from there to the symphony luncheon."
"RICHARD: Well, I'll tag along there too."
"EMILY: Yes, but from there I get my hair done, and you certainly don't want to sit around while I have my hair done."
"RICHARD: No, I don't."
"EMILY: There you go."
"RICHARD: Well, you can cancel that."
"EMILY: I can't cancel that. I get my hair done every Wednesday at three."
"RICHARD: Well, your hair looks fine."
"EMILY: My hair looks fine because I have my hair done every Wednesday at three."
"RICHARD: Well then what am I going to do?"
"EMILY: Why don't you go to the club?"
"RICHARD: What?"
"EMILY: Yes, the club! You spend a fortune to belong there and you never got to go much before. Why don't you go there now?"
"RICHARD: Go to the club on a Wednesday afternoon?"
"EMILY: I think it would be perfect."
"RICHARD: I don't even know what they do at the club on a Wednesday afternoon."
"EMILY: No time like the present to find out."
"RICHARD: All right, I'll go to the club."
"EMILY: Wonderful. [starts walking him to the front door]"
"RICHARD: Go to the club on a Wednesday afternoon. Life certainly is an interesting game of cards, isn't it?"
"EMILY: It certainly is."
"RICHARD: Well, um, I'll see you, uh, tonight."
"EMILY: Have a good time. [closes door] Graciela, I need more coffee now!"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW VIDEO"
"[Rory and Lorelai walk around the video store trying to decide on a movie]"
"LORELAI: How about a triple feature? Three Days of the Condor, Shoah and The Jerk?"
"RORY: Uh, Shoah's like nine and a half hours."
"LORELAI: But The Jerk is short."
"RORY: Hmm, next."
"LORELAI: The three faces of Costner  Bull Durham, Dances with Wolves, The Postman. Tom Petty playing Tom Petty, that great big speech about Once upon a time there was a thing called mail.' It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll make you wanna mail something."
"RORY: Ooh, we could do a Ruth Gordon film festival. Harold and Maude, Rosemary's Baby, and that really great episode of Taxi."
"LORELAI: Got it. The worst film festival ever. Cool as Ice, Hudson Hawk, and Electric Bugaloo."
"RORY: Sold."
"LORELAI: I'll get the Hawk."
"RORY: I'll get the Bugaloo."
"[Rory leans down to look through the shelf of videos. Two boys are sitting on the floor looking at a movie box.]"
"BOY 1: See, I told you."
"BOY 2: Wow."
"RORY: Hey guys, can I get in there?"
"BOY 1: Oh, yeah. [both boys walk away]"
"[Rory finds the movie and stands back up]"
"LORELAI: Got it, plus four boxes of Red Vines."
"RORY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Hi Kirk."
"KIRK: Evening Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Um, I forgot my card at home but I think my number's 6247."
"KIRK: You forgot your card?"
"LORELAI: I might've lost it."
"KIRK: You lost your card?"
"LORELAI: I might have."
"KIRK: Was it temporary or laminated?"
"LORELAI: Laminated."
"KIRK: That's a permanent card. You lost a permanent card."
"LORELAI: You can just get me a new card Kirk."
"KIRK: Fine, but I hope you understand the gravity of the situation here."
"LORELAI: I'm trying to grasp it."
"KIRK: I mean, these cards are agreements. It's an agreement between you and the Stars Hollow Video Store stating that you will take care of your card, that you will honor your card, that you will very, very nice to your card..."
"[Lorelai's cell phone is ringing]"
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: I'll be right back."
"LORELAI: Thanks. [answers phone] Hello? Hello? [to Rory] Reception sucks in here, I'll be right back."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Hello? [walks away]"
"KIRK: It'll be ready in a minute."
"RORY: Hey Kirk, there are a couple of little kids over there and they're, uh, looking at this tape cover that's kind of mature. You might wanna put that stuff on a higher shelf or something."
"KIRK: Mature? How mature?"
"RORY: Uh, it's a half-naked woman just standing there."
"KIRK: Is she a blonde?"
"RORY: What?"
"KIRK: I'll check it out right now. [walks away]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai walks out of the video store to talk on the phone]"
"LORELAI: Hey Mom, I can hear you now. What's up?"
"EMILY: You have to take your father."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Tomorrow, for the whole day, just take him."
"LORELAI: Take him where?"
"EMILY: I don't care -- the zoo, the mall, Rhode Island, just get him out of my house!"
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"EMILY: He's going to join my water aerobics class."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: He bought some new swim trunks today. He's out of control."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom, calm down."
"EMILY: I can't calm down! I can't turn around without him being there, following me, staring at me."
"LORELAI: Well, he likes you."
"EMILY: Don't be cute, do not be cute. The man is driving me insane. I am going to go insane, and if you don't help me, I will take you with me."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom, I would like to help you but wh --."
"EMILY: You owe me!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: I pay for Rory's school!"
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"EMILY: And I cosigned your loan! You still have a house because of me!"
"LORELAI: Are you hearing yourself?"
"EMILY: I'm sorry but I'm desperate. I just need one day of peace and I will do anything to get it, anything."
"LORELAI: Okay Mom, fine, uh, I'll take him."
"EMILY: I can't tell you how much I appreciate this."
"RICHARD: [calls from another room] Emily! Where are you?"
"EMILY: I have to go. Tomorrow morning."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow morning. Bye."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is in her bedroom getting ready for school as Lorelai walks in.]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, the most horrible thing just happened. Headmaster Charleston's office called, he's been kidnapped! Two guys broke into his house and threw him in a hefty bag, used those twisty ties and carted him off. Classes have been canceled until further notice."
"RORY: I am going to school Mom."
"LORELAI: Rory, come on, it's just one day. I'll write you a note. Dear n*zi, Rory had to miss school today on account of saving her mom from spending the entire day with her father who often looks at her like she has three heads.'"
"RORY: Out of my way please."
"LORELAI: Do you know the last time my father and I were alone together for any extended period of time?"
"RORY: Unh uh."
"LORELAI: I was kicked out of summer class for refusing to call the camp counselor Peaches because I thought the entire concept of the counselors choosing summer fruit names was stupid. So they called my dad and he came to get me and it was just the two of us alone in the car all the way from Maine with nothing to talk about but my camp failure. Luckily I had also flashed the swim team or even that subject would've gotten stale."
"RORY: Mom, I have the Franklin today. I cannot miss it."
"LORELAI: Rory, please. I can't handle the entire day with him. I can't, I can't, I caaaaan't."
"RORY: Mom, I promise. Just make it till the afternoon, and then I promise I'll come right home and I'll take Grandpa off your hands."
"LORELAI: All right."
"RORY: It'll be fine."
"LORELAI: It is not going to be fine. It's going to be horrible. It is going to be a bad, depressing Lifetime movie and Nancy McKeon will be playing me. I am Jo."
"[the doorbell rings]"
"LORELAI: And that would be him."
"RORY: It's not going to be that bad. Hey. Be nice."
"LORELAI: Be nice."
"RORY: Oh, very good."
"[they answer the front door, Richard is standing there]"
"LORELAI: Hi Dad."
"RORY: Hey Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Good morning girls."
"LORELAI: Did you have any trouble getting here?"
"RICHARD: Not at all, the directions were fine."
"RORY: Well I have to be going, but I'll see you this afternoon."
"RICHARD: I look forward to it."
"RORY: Have fun. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: So good drive, huh?"
"RICHARD: Very good."
"LORELAI: Oh, here. [takes Richard's coat] Would you like some coffee?"
"RICHARD: I'm fine. Do you want coffee?"
"LORELAI: Oh yes, God yes, thank you."
"[They walk into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: So you sure you don't, um. . ."
"RICHARD: Coffee? Uh, no, no, no, no."
"LORELAI: Well, uh, can I offer you anything else? Some Pop Tarts or. . .well, that's pretty much it."
"RICHARD: You don't have to entertain me Lorelai. I just came here to see you and your house and your town. You don't have to do anything special for me."
"LORELAI: But you're my guest."
"RICHARD: No, I'm your father. Just do whatever it is you would normally do."
"LORELAI: What I would normally do."
"RICHARD: Yes. Like for instance, this morning if I wasn't here, you would wake up, obviously get some coffee and. . .then what?"
"LORELAI: Well, um, I'd probably read the paper for a little while and then have some breakfast."
"RICHARD: Let's read the paper then."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's read the paper. [they sit down at the table] Um, what sections would you like?"
"RICHARD: Oh, you go first. I'll take what's left."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay. Well, um, normally I read the Arts and Leisure and the Lifestyles."
"RICHARD: Perfect. Well, that leaves Business, Sports, and World News."
"LORELAI: Oh. That worked out well."
"RICHARD: Yes it did, didn't it?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Richard walk in]"
"LORELAI: Well, this is it, Luke's."
"RICHARD: You know, when I was in college, there was this horrible little diner across from my apartment building. It was run by this terrible little couple, they were very angry. They would fight, break plates, curse, and I went in there every morning for three years and I had the most dreadful breakfast, just awful. I really miss that place."
"LUKE: Morning."
"LORELAI: Hey. Um, Luke, you remember my father?"
"LUKE: Oh yeah, nice to see you again."
"RICHARD: Nice to see you. This is quite a place you've got here."
"LUKE: It pays the bills."
"RICHARD: Always a plus in business."
"LORELAI: Dad, do you know what you want?"
"RICHARD: Oh, I already ate."
"LORELAI: You did? When?"
"RICHARD: Oh, I had breakfast at home. I get up at 5:30 every morning."
"LORELAI: Wow. Why?"
"RICHARD: Well I've gotten up at 5:30 for as long as I can remember."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but that was when you had to work. Now you can afford to get a little crazy, get up at quarter to six."
"RICHARD: Go ahead and order Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll have a banana, pancakes, side of bacon, and lots and lots of coffee."
"LUKE: Coming right up. [walks away]"
"RICHARD: You didn't order any grapefruit."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I don't really like grapefruit."
"RICHARD: Oh, I always start my breakfast off with half a grapefruit."
"LORELAI: Hm, do the Florida people know about you? Because Anita Bryant left this huge gap that has yet to be filled."
"RICHARD: It's important to start the day off correctly, Lorelai. A grapefruit is brain food. It has vitamin C and folic acid and it helps with your digestion. It really is a terrific fruit."
"LORELAI: I feel like you're about to break into song."
"RICHARD: I'm serious about this Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I know you are but I still don't like grapefruit."
"RICHARD: Well, there are many things in life that we don't like, but the benefits they bring us far outweigh the temporary discomforts we have to endure."
"LORELAI: Okay. Hold on a sec."
"[Lorelai walks up to Luke at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I need a grapefruit."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Before my pancakes this morning I need half a grapefruit, uh, preferably one that tastes like a donut."
"LUKE: I don't have grapefruit."
"LORELAI: How can you not have grapefruit?"
"LUKE: I've never had grapefruit."
"LORELAI: I need a grapefr. . .Listen, I have my father with me all day, and so far there's been no major drama or yelling or ugliness but there will be if I don't somehow find a way to get half a grapefruit for breakfast this morning."
"LUKE: I could go next door to Doose's and buy a grapefruit."
"LORELAI: I would be eternally grateful."
"LUKE: I'll be right back."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Lorelai walks back to the table]"
"LORELAI: Okay, the grapefruit is coming."
"RICHARD: Oh, you won't be sorry."
"LORELAI: So listen, I was thinking, um, maybe after we're done here, you might like to walk around town a little, see the sites. And then Rory usually gets home around four. The two of you can hang out at the house until I get off work and the three of us can hook up for dinner. How does that sound?"
"RICHARD: Very sensible."
"LORELAI: Well yeah, I had to make up for my shoes."
"RICHARD: Is that your second cup of coffee?"
"LORELAI: Uh, third. Why?"
"RICHARD: No reason. That's a lot of coffee first thing in the morning."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory is at her locker. She slams it shut and finds Paris standing there.]"
"RORY: Okay, you have got to stop doing that."
"PARIS: So I've been doing some research on the Oppenheimer Award, and I've noticed something. All of the winning schools had an extremely strong human interest story on page one."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: And I think that's what we need. I mean, we've got the teen issues down, we've got a decent op-ed and political page, but human interest  that's what we're missing."
"RORY: Ideas?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"RORY: Do tell."
"PARIS: According to the papers, there's been a huge increase in the number of families fleeing the major cities in favor of small towns. Hundreds of thousands of city slicking yuppies carting the trophy wife and the asthmatic kids off to small towns in search of the simple life. Milk a cow, pet a pig, find yourself, all that kind of crap."
"RORY: Interesting."
"PARIS: Yeah, and I thought about it. There's a romantic aspect to small towns. White picket fences, low crime rate, smaller classrooms, better tomatoes. It all seems perfect."
"RORY: But?"
"PARIS: But nothing is perfect, nothing is safe, nothing is ever what it seems. And then it hit me - our story. We are going to blow the lid off the seedy underbelly of small town life, starting with yours."
"RORY: Stars Hollows?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"RORY: You are going to uncover the seedy underbelly of Stars Hollow?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"RORY: Paris, Stars Hollow doesn't have a seedy underbelly. We don't even have a meter maid."
"PARIS: Look, you may be blind to it because you live there, but trust me, it's there and it's ugly and I'm going to find it. I'll meet you out front after school."
"RORY: I can't today."
"PARIS: Why not? Are you hiding something?"
"RORY: No. I promised my mom that I would help her with something."
"PARIS: Well, help her tomorrow. We have work to do."
"RORY: Paris!"
"PARIS: Hey, this could be our chance to nail this thing. Now I have a hunch that there's a story here and a good one, and I'm going to find it. I was even going to share a byline with you on it, but if you wanna bail out, that's fine. I'll just do it myself."
"RORY: But -."
"PARIS: Am I meeting you or not?"
"RORY: I don't think you're gonna find anything."
"PARIS: Well, then the worst that can happen is that I spend some time in your town and suddenly have an urge to enter a pie in the county fair. I'll meet you out front, don't be late."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel is at the front desk on the phone as Lorelai walks over]"
"MICHEL: As soon as I can, I will send someone up. . . Yes, I will. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . .I understand. . . Okay. . .I understand. Goodbye. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: What do you understand?"
"MICHEL: I have no idea. I tuned him out at the first screech."
"LORELAI: Have we heard from Manny yet?"
"MICHEL: No, and I have paged him twice."
"LORELAI: We only have enough linen for one seating tonight. Hand me the phone."
"MICHEL: Plus we are completely out of clean towels."
"LORELAI: [oh phone] Hi, Sophie, it's Lorelai. I need to talk to Manny. . . Well, when will he be back? . . . Okay, I need him to call me really, really soon, like five minutes ago. Okay, thanks. [hangs up] We need a backup plan."
"MICHEL: Mm hmm."
"LORELAI: Call Patty's and see if she has any party rental tablecloths we can use for tonight and then pull all the towels from the pool and call Gandolfi's and order a case of champagne. Send a bottle to every room that's towel-less and just page him every two minutes and oh no! [sees Richard walk into the inn]"
"RICHARD: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi Dad, what are you doing? Uh, I thought you were gonna tour the town."
"RICHARD: Oh, I did, I did. I went into all the stores, the cat one twice. And then I walked around a little and then I was done."
"LORELAI: But what about the park  did you see the park?"
"RICHARD: Yes, I saw the park."
"LORELAI: Uh, what about the giant slinky over on Klump? We're mighty proud of that."
"RICHARD: I saw the slinky, yes. And the hundred-year-old oak tree and the life-size yarn person. I even stopped by your house and had Babette introduce me to all of her gnomes."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RICHARD: And then I realized the only thing I had not seen is my daughter at work."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, watching me at work is not very interesting, trust me."
"RICHARD: Oh, you underestimate yourself."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, um, there's books on the shelves over there."
"RICHARD: No no, I have my newspaper, I'm fine."
"LORELAI: All right, I'm just gonna. . . what's the matter?"
"RICHARD: Is your jacket in the back?"
"LORELAI: My jacket?"
"RICHARD: Your work jacket?"
"LORELAI: I don't have a work jacket."
"RICHARD: So that's your working outfit?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RICHARD: And your boss doesn't mind?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well considering my boss is me, no, she doesn't. I mean, she did at first but then I bought her a cup of coffee and I realized all the hostility she was expressing toward me was just jealousy and we've been best friends ever since. Just take a seat Dad. [walks to the front desk] Hey, will you get me an extra bottle of champagne and smack me over the head with it?"
"MICHEL: Absolutely."
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Independence Inn."
"RORY: I need you to sit down, breathe, and remember that you're at work, so screaming and crying is not an option."
"LORELAI: Why, what are you doing?"
"RORY: I can't meet you after school today."
"LORELAI: What? You promised."
"RORY: I know but I have to work on this story for the Franklin and I swear I tried to get out of it, but I couldn't."
"LORELAI: Oh great."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: Oh no, school comes before Mommy's mental health."
"RORY: Just tell Grandpa to wander around for awhile."
"LORELAI: He already wandered."
"RORY: Did he see the slinky?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he saw the slinky."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: He's here now."
"RORY: Oh."
"LORELAI: And he hates my shirt."
"RORY: Give him a book and have Sookie make him lunch and I swear I'll be home by dinner and you won't have to say a word."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW BUS STOP"
"[Rory and Paris get off of the bus]"
"PARIS: I think I got rabies."
"RORY: It's just a bus, Paris."
"PARIS: It smelled."
"RORY: It smelled like a bus."
"PARIS: I'm gonna have to burn my clothes when I get home."
"RORY: You know Paris, you have a car. We could've driven."
"PARIS: We have to get the feel of the small town world. You're not going to get the feel of a small town world in a BMW. Is there something crawling in my hair?"
"RORY: All right, so we're here now, where do you wanna go?"
"PARIS: I don't know, where's the bad part of town?"
"RORY: Uhh, over there."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Uh, people - they're very upset with the color of that fence."
"PARIS: Come on."
"RORY: This is the town Paris, this is it. It's not seedy, it's not rundown, it's just Stars Hollow."
"PARIS: Well, where's the local bar?"
"RORY: In Woodbridge."
"PARIS: Why aren't you helping?"
"RORY: I'm trying, you're just looking for something that's not here."
"PARIS: What's this?"
"RORY: Luke's Diner."
"PARIS: Diner. Okay, good, good."
""
""
""
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S"
"[Paris and Rory walk in and sit at the counter. Paris starts looking at a menu.]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"PARIS: Trying just to blend in, fade away, observe."
"LUKE: Hey Rory. Coffee?"
"RORY: Thanks Luke."
"LUKE: Who's your friend?"
"RORY: Angela Landsbury."
"LUKE: Oh."
"PARIS: You're the owner here?"
"LUKE: Yup. You want some coffee Angela?"
"PARIS: No thanks."
"LUKE: Okay."
"PARIS: So, you run the diner, huh?"
"RORY: Oh boy."
"PARIS: You get a lot of truckers through here?"
"LUKE: Truckers?"
"PARIS: Yeah. You know, guys on the road for weeks, lonely, looking for company, a little pick me up. Things like that."
"LUKE: What's she talking about?"
"RORY: Your guess is as good as mine."
"PARIS: It's pretty common knowledge that diners are breeding grounds for prostitution and drug dealers."
"LUKE: What?"
"PARIS: Have you ever seen anything like that going down here?"
"LUKE: Have I ever. . ."
"PARIS: What about that guy over there? What's his story?"
"LUKE: Reverend Nichols?"
"PARIS: Reverend Nichols, huh? What is that, like Dr. Feelgood?"
"LUKE: Rory, how much do you like this person?"
"RORY: Do what you gotta do, Luke."
"[Jess comes down the steps into the diner]"
"PARIS: Hey, where'd he come from? What's up there? Is that where you keep the girls? You got yourself a little cathouse up there?"
"JESS: Wow, I think she got you Uncle Luke. You better give up now."
"LUKE: Do not add to this insanity."
"JESS: An innocent boy like me should not be raised in an atmosphere like this."
"LUKE: Jess!"
"JESS: I wanna be good, life's just not letting me."
"LUKE: Rory, get her out of here."
"RORY: Okay, let's go. [pulls Paris towards the door]"
"PARIS: Why do you need me to leave? What have you got to hide?"
"RORY: Paris, let's go!"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai and Michel are at the front desk, each talking on a phone]"
"MICHEL: Yes, we're aware of it."
"LORELAI: Yes, we're working on it."
"MICHEL: As soon as towels arrive, yours will be the first room we come up to."
"LORELAI: I swear to you, no one gets a towel before you do."
"MICHEL: Did you get the complimentary champagne we sent you?"
"LORELAI: Just open the champagne and drink and relax and enjoy and before you know it  of course it's free. Yes."
"MICHEL: Yeah, we'll call you soon. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: We'll talk to you soon. [hangs up] I'm k*ll Manny."
"MICHEL: I'm helping."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna strangle him with one of his own towels, I swear to God."
"RICHARD: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yeah Dad?"
"RICHARD: Do you realize there are no tablecloths in the dining room?"
"LORELAI: Yes I do. We're having a problem with our linen delivery."
"RICHARD: Well, it doesn't look very professional."
"MICHEL: [in background] Ah, it's Manny."
"LORELAI: Okay, I have to take this dad."
"[Michel hands her the phone]"
"LORELAI: Manny, my mysterious man, where have you been? . . . Oh, me Manny? I'm just a desperate woman. Yes. Honey, I know you're up to your ears in problems but I have to have some towels or linens or I'm gonna be lying on the street talking about the pretty inn I used to work at and you don't want that do you? . . . Well, just, anything you can do to get me through the night. . . Uh, Manny, I love you. You rock. I am devoted to you. I'm never gonna look at another towel without thinking of you. . . Thank you. Bye Stud. [hangs up] He'll be here in twenty minutes."
"RICHARD: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yes Dad?"
"RICHARD: May I speak to you for a moment please?"
"MICHEL: Someone is in trouble."
"LORELAI: Uh, is something wrong Dad?"
"RICHARD: Was that a business call I just overheard there?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that was my linen delivery guy."
"RICHARD: So it was a business call?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it was a business call."
"RICHARD: And that's how you handle a business call?"
"LORELAI: I've known Manny for ten years, Dad."
"RICHARD: I don't care how long you've known him. You never talk to a business associate like that, especially not one that you employ."
"LORELAI: Okay Dad."
"RICHARD: These people have to respect you."
"LORELAI: He does respect me."
"RICHARD: You were flirting with him."
"LORELAI: I said what I needed to say in order to get the linen before somebody else did. And I did, so I won."
"RICHARD: This is not about winning, this is about proper procedure. You need to listen to me Lorelai. If there is one thing I know about, it is the correct way to conduct yourself in a position of authority. Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you?"
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"RICHARD: Because I'm only telling you this for your own good."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"RICHARD: All right, go back to work. I'll be right here if you need me."
"LORELAI: Okie dokie."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Paris are walking down the sidewalk]"
"PARIS: Nothing, not even a cigarette butt on the ground, I can't believe it. This town would make Frank Capra wanna throw up."
"RORY: Sorry, I tried to tell you."
"PARIS: I know. I know, it's just. . .I was just so sure."
"RORY: We'll think of something else to write about, I promise."
"PARIS: We're going to lose."
"RORY: We're not going to lose."
"[As they walk past the video store, Taylor and Kirk walk out.]"
"TAYLOR: There she is, the girl of the moment."
"RORY: Me?"
"TAYLOR: You, young lady, are my hero."
"RORY: Why is that Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Because in this day and age when the kids are willy nilly with their clothes and hair and morals, it is heartwarming to see a sensible girl like you still exists. A girl who has the gumption and the guts to stand up and say, why are we allowing this trash out where all our children can see it?'"
"KIRK: And a few selected adults also."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"TAYLOR: Well, come on in and see for yourself."
"CUT TO INSIDE VIDEO STORE"
"RORY: What happened? Where is everything?"
"TAYLOR: Well, thanks to your brilliant suggestion, they are all safely stashed behind the Rory Curtain."
"RORY: The what?"
"KIRK: We thought it was only fitting to name it after you."
"RORY: No! I don't want a Rory Curtain, I never asked for a Rory Curtain!"
"TAYLOR: You told me to put that movie where the kids couldn't see it."
"PARIS: You did?"
"RORY: Well, yeah, but I just meant to put it on a higher shelf, not to get fabric involved."
"TAYLOR: Oh, this is much better than a higher shelf. Now all the movies that we deem objectionable will be safely hidden from the eyes of the children. Plus, it'll make the adults think twice before they go back there."
"RORY: No, I did not mean to do this! What are you doing?"
"PARIS: This is it."
"RORY: This is what?"
"PARIS: Our story. Censorship in a small town, it's perfect."
"RORY: Paris, stop it. You know I don't believe in censorship."
"PARIS: Even better, small town minds run amok. This is genius, it's gold. We're going to win. Now Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Yes?"
"PARIS: On the record, how long have you been working here?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks through the front door followed by Richard.]"
"LORELAI: Rory, we're home!"
"RICHARD: Next time, stop the car completely before you get out."
"LORELAI: Rory, for the love of God, be home!"
"RORY: I'm here, sorry! I was on the phone. How was your  [Lorelai grabs Rory and hugs her tightly] Ooh, okay."
"LORELAI: I don't think I've ever loved you quite as much as I love you right now."
"RORY: Ah, ribs cracking, organs crushing."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, love hurts. [walks past Rory towards the kitchen]"
"RORY: Hey Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Oh, lovely to see you Rory."
"RORY: How was your day?"
"RICHARD: It was very pleasant."
"RORY: I heard you saw Mom in action."
"LORELAI: Oh yes he did."
"RORY: She's great, isn't she?"
"RICHARD: She's. . uh, spirited."
"LORELAI: Spirited."
"RORY: Spirited is nice. Hey, let's talk dinner. How about Chinese?"
"LORELAI: Very spirited food."
"RORY: Grandpa, do you like Chinese food?"
"RICHARD: If prepared properly, yes, I like it very much."
"LORELAI: I'll go call Al's. [walks into kitchen]"
"RICHARD: Al's?"
"RORY: Al's Pancake World."
"RICHARD: [follows Lorelai into the kitchen] I thought you said we were having Chinese food."
"LORELAI: Al's has the best egg fu yung in Stars Hollow."
"RICHARD: Is that, um, saying anything?"
"LORELAI: Rory, come entertain your Grandpa while your spirited Mommy orders please!"
"RORY: Hey Grandpa, do you um. . .do you wanna see my room?"
"RICHARD: Yes, I would."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Richard walks into Rory's room.]"
"LORELAI: Twenty bucks if you lock him in there."
"RORY: Thirty if you chill."
"CUT TO INSIDE RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Richard is looking at Rory's bookshelf as Rory walks in]"
"RICHARD: Interesting."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"RICHARD: Oh, there are some holes in your collection here and I'm just making a list to fill them."
"RORY: Oh, well these aren't all of my books."
"RICHARD: Oh?"
"[Rory shows him several stacks of books under her bed]"
"RICHARD: Oh my goodness!"
"RORY: And. . . [opens two drawers filled with books]"
"RICHARD: Ah, well possibly I should concentrate on acquiring you a bookcase first."
"RORY: That's okay. I kind of like my system."
"RICHARD: Ah, organized chaos?"
"RORY: Exactly."
"RICHARD: Very well, carry on. Well, I'm glad not to see any death rockers on your walls."
"RORY: Grandpa, where did you learn the term death rockers?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'm not entirely unfamiliar with the music world in which you live."
"RORY: I don't exactly live in the death rock world, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Good."
"RORY: But if I do move there, I will send you a card."
"RICHARD: Oh, I appreciate that. Ah, Harvard."
"RORY: Yeah. We started the obsession board a few years ago. And then when we took that trip to Harvard, the student store was having a two for one flag sale, so that kind of sent us into the final stage of the psychosis. Hospitals were called, medications were prescribed, there is no cure."
"[Lorelai walks in with a notepad]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I made the menu for the evening."
"RICHARD: My God."
"RORY: Looks good."
"RICHARD: Who could eat all that food?"
"LORELAI: I almost added the garlic chicken."
"RORY: Add it."
"RICHARD: There are only three of us."
"LORELAI: Yes, but we like choices."
"RORY: Let's call, I'm starved."
"[they walk into the kitchen]"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, you cannot order all of that food. You're teaching your daughter wastefulness and gluttony."
"LORELAI: Um Dad, we do this all the time. We order way too much and then we eat like a third of it and live off the leftovers for a week and a half. It's a finely honed system. Now please, just sit and read something or watch TV."
"RICHARD: So I uh. . .I noticed all the Harvard paraphernalia in Rory's room."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah."
"RICHARD: You know, you might not want to get her settled on one specific college quite so soon."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"RICHARD: Well, she's young. She hasn't investigated her options."
"LORELAI: Dad, she wants to go to Harvard."
"RICHARD: Well yes, because she thinks you want her to go to Harvard."
"LORELAI: I do."
"RICHARD: Well, there are a lot of other good schools out there. You know I went to Yale."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do know."
"RICHARD: Yale is a very fine school, some might argue a better school than Harvard."
"LORELAI: Some meaning you?"
"RICHARD: I just think Rory should explore it, and I can make some phone calls and set up an appointment."
"LORELAI: No."
"RICHARD: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because she wants to go to Harvard."
"RICHARD: But that's ridiculous. Who's going to help her get into Harvard?"
"LORELAI: Reese Witherspoon."
"RICHARD: I am a Yale alumnus. I give a great deal of money to that school. Getting her in will be a breeze."
"LORELAI: We don't like breezes, they mess up our hair."
"RICHARD: Do not be petulant Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Do not pick a fight with me Dad."
"RICHARD: This is not about you, this is about Rory."
"LORELAI: No, this is about Richard interfering."
"RICHARD: Now please, just let me handle this. I know more about the Ivy League system than you do."
"[a horn honks from outside]"
"LORELAI: This is not about the - ."
"RORY: Is that the food already?"
"LORELAI: No Sweets, I haven't ordered yet."
"[Rory looks out the window]"
"RORY: Oh my God!"
"LORELAI: Who is it?"
"RORY: Oh my God!"
"CUT TO OUT FRONT"
"[They walk out the front door. Dean is standing in front of a car]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"RORY: Whatcha doin'?"
"DEAN: Just standing here."
"RORY: Next to?"
"DEAN: A car. Your car."
"RORY: No!"
"DEAN: Finished it yesterday."
"RORY: No you didn't!"
"DEAN: Do you want them? [holds up the keys]"
"RORY: Ah! [Rory runs off the porch and hugs him]"
"DEAN: Now if you don't like it, I bet I can sell it to someone else."
"RORY: Don't you dare!"
"LORELAI: Dean, that's amazing!"
"RORY: Let's drive, can we drive, does it drive?"
"DEAN: Does it drive?"
"RORY: Well, no, I know it drives but. . .oh my God! I can't believe you finished it! You built me a car!"
"LORELAI: Dean, now that you're done with that, will you build me a plane? One that looks like Shamu?"
"RICHARD: He made that car?"
"LORELAI: Isn't that incredible?"
"RICHARD: Well, she can't accept it."
"LORELAI: Oh Dad, it's okay."
"RICHARD: It's not okay, he's a child. She's not driving a car a child put together."
"DEAN: Excuse me sir, but, uh, my father worked on cars and my grandfather worked on cars. I know what I'm doing."
"RICHARD: A car is not a model airplane, young man."
"DEAN: I know that."
"RICHARD: It is a complex vehicle."
"DEAN: I know that too."
"RICHARD: And I will not have my granddaughter driving around in some contraption you put together in auto shop."
"LORELAI: Okay, can I just say something here?"
"DEAN: I did not make this in auto shop. I am telling you this car is safe."
"RICHARD: So, you are a certified mechanic?"
"DEAN: No."
"RICHARD: But you had the assistance of a certified mechanic?"
"DEAN: No."
"RICHARD: Well, then you drove it past a certified mechanic?"
"LORELAI: Dad, stop it. This is a nice thing Dean did here. Remember, nice things."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, she can't accept it. Now, if you will excuse us, we were about to order dinner."
"DEAN: Mr. Gilmore, I understand you want Rory to be safe, but so do I. I would not give this car to her if I did not know for a fact that it was a hundred percent safe. I checked it, my father checked it, and Gypsy at Hewes Brothers checked it. It has been checked."
"RICHARD: And I'm just supposed to take your word for it?"
"DEAN: Nope."
"RICHARD: Agreed."
"DEAN: Let's go."
"RICHARD: Go where?"
"DEAN: To check it."
"RICHARD: I don't think so."
"DEAN: I've been working on this car for months. I'm giving it to Rory."
"RICHARD: You're a very stubborn boy."
"DEAN: Do you wanna drive or should I?"
"RICHARD: I'll take my own car, thank you."
"DEAN: Fine with me."
"RICHARD: And drive behind me. I don't want that thing blowing up right in front of the Jag."
"DEAN: No problem. Try to keep your electrical system working long enough to get there."
"RICHARD: They worked the kinks out of this electrical system years ago, young man. I'll be right back."
"DEAN: So will I."
"[Dean and Richard get in their cars and drive off.]"
"LORELAI: Don't you feel like one of us should've been standing between them waving a flag or something?"
"CUT TO HEWES BROS."
"[The mechanic looks under the hood of the car while Richard and Dean stand nearby.]"
"GYPSY: It looks fine to me."
"RICHARD: Check it again."
"GYPSY: I already checked it again. This was checking it again. I checked it earlier, that means this was checking it again."
"DEAN: Go ahead Gypsy, check it again. I've got all night."
"GYPSY: I don't."
"RICHARD: Check the transmission."
"GYPSY: I did, it's all good."
"RICHARD: The carburetor."
"GYPSY: All good."
"RICHARD: Manifold pressure?"
"GYPSY: Best manifold pressure I've ever seen."
"RICHARD: You've missed something. I insist that you go over this entire car again."
"GYPSY: But I'm telling you, there's nothing wrong with this car."
"RICHARD: I am paying you for a service, I would like that service performed."
"GYPSY: Okay, I look again."
"DEAN: How many times are you gonna make her do that?"
"RICHARD: As many times as it takes."
"DEAN: Look, I know you think I'm not good enough for Rory, but do you have to take it out on my car?"
"RICHARD: She's my only granddaughter. I have a responsibility to protect her. She's young, she's naïve."
"DEAN: She's smart."
"RICHARD: Yes, she's smart. . .about certain things."
"DEAN: Look, I'm not about to do battle with you here. You can hate me - whatever, I don't care."
"RICHARD: I hardly hate you."
"DEAN: Really?"
"RICHARD: I don't even know you."
"DEAN: Well, I'm right here. What do you wanna know? Besides what college I wanna go to or what I wanna do for a living, because I still have no answers for you on that front."
"RICHARD: Those are not ridiculous questions to ask."
"DEAN: No, but you could've waited until dessert to get to them."
"RICHARD: Yes, well, perhaps the timing of the. . ."
"DEAN: Interrogation?"
"RICHARD: Conversation."
"DEAN: Conversation."
"RICHARD: Perhaps the timing was a little off. [pause] So, your father  what does he do?"
"DEAN: Stereo systems."
"RICHARD: Installing them?"
"DEAN: Selling them. He's got a shop a couple of blocks from here."
"RICHARD: And your mother?"
"DEAN: She works part time transcribing medical records."
"RICHARD: Interesting, interesting. So, you. . .you like my granddaughter quite a bit?"
"DEAN: No, I love your granddaughter quite a bit."
"RICHARD: See Dean, I was beginning to feel a little better about this until you said that."
"DEAN: Well, I'm not trying to make you feel better, I'm trying to be honest."
"RICHARD: Yes, you are. It's an admirable quality."
"DEAN: Thank you."
"GYPSY: Okay, I found something wrong."
"RICHARD: You did?"
"DEAN: What?"
"GYPSY: Windshield wipers came right off in my hand, very dangerous. Thank God I check it again."
"DEAN: Gypsy, you broke those off yourself."
"GYPSY: Yes I did."
"DEAN: Put them back!"
"GYPSY: I can't look at this car anymore."
"DEAN: Gypsy!"
"GYPSY: I miss my home."
"DEAN: Put them back."
"RICHARD: Now I suppose the car is safe."
"DEAN: It is."
"RICHARD: I'm still not sure it's an appropriate gift."
"DEAN: I understand that."
"RICHARD: How tall are you?"
"DEAN: Why, you wanna dance?"
"RICHARD: No, thank you. I appreciate the offer though."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory sit on the couch.]"
"RORY: How long are they going to be?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Knowing my dad, he probably made Dean take the entire thing apart and put it back together again in front of him."
"RORY: Poor Dean."
"LORELAI: Poor Dean, he has to spend one evening with him. I share chromosomes with the guy."
"[Richard walks through the front door]"
"RICHARD: Well, we had it thoroughly checked. We found a little problem with the windshield wipers. Dean is there now adjusting them. But once that is taken care of, I don't see any reason why, with proper insurance of course, why you can't have that car."
"RORY: Really? Thanks!"
"LORELAI: Hey hon, why don't you run and pick up the food for us?"
"RORY: Oh sure."
"RICHARD: Oh, I've got this."
"LORELAI: Here you go, hurry! Before the mu shu congeals."
"RORY: Okay. [leaves]"
"RICHARD: Why didn't you let me pay?"
"LORELAI: I didn't think it would be, um, appropriate under the circumstances."
"RICHARD: What circumstances are those?"
"LORELAI: The ones where I'm about to get really, really mad at you."
"RICHARD: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Dad, this is my house in my town, where I live my life."
"RICHARD: Well, thank you for the geography lesson."
"LORELAI: No, I'm - in the thirty two years we've known each other, have I once come to your work and criticized the way you handled your clients?"
"RICHARD: I don't remember you coming to my work at all."
"LORELAI: Well, have I passed judgment on your breakfast habits or your clothing choices?"
"RICHARD: I was offering opinions."
"LORELAI: Well, don't. I don't want your opinions, especially not in front of my employees and not in front of my friends."
"RICHARD: I guess you can't take constructive criticism."
"LORELAI: Nothing that came out of your mouth today might, in any universe visited by Kirk or Spock, be construed as constructive."
"RICHARD: I beg to differ."
"LORELAI: And this is absolutely the last time you come into my house and overrule my word."
"RICHARD: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: I'm talking about Dean and the car."
"RICHARD: I was being - ."
"LORELAI: You have no right being anything. Rory's my kid and I make the rules, so if she comes home one day and says, Hey, uh, I'm gonna spend the weekend with Patricia Krenwinkle' and I say, Okay, grab a sweater', you just have to deal."
"RICHARD: Who is Patricia Krenwinkle?"
"LORELAI: And if I tell her that she can have the car that her boyfriend made for her, then she can."
"RICHARD: I didn't think it looked safe."
"LORELAI: You don't have to think it looks safe! I have to think it looks safe! God, why can't I make you hear what I'm saying?"
"RICHARD: Oh, I hear exactly what you're saying."
"LORELAI: You came here not as a guest but as the judgment police, you kept your uniform on the whole time, and you know what, it comes off now!"
"RICHARD: Lower your voice."
"LORELAI: No! I am a grown woman and you will treat me the way you treat people who have invited you to their house or you will not be invited again."
"RICHARD: Invited?"
"LORELAI: Yes!"
"RICHARD: Don't you think I know why you invited me here?"
"LORELAI: Because - ."
"RICHARD: Because your mother asked you too. She called you up and said I was driving her crazy, and would you please take me off her hands for one day so she can get some peace. Isn't that true?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RICHARD: You have never once invited me to your house Lorelai, never. And I can hardly point to an event that would prompt you to do so except my recent employment situation."
"LORELAI: Okay Dad, Mom did call me but - ."
"RICHARD: You know, I never thought about retirement. I never thought about what I would do or what I would be once I wasn't working. I never once imagined that I would go from being a productive member of the human race to a decrepit old drone sitting at the club at three in the afternoon drinking brandy and playing cards."
"LORELAI: Aw, Dad."
"RICHARD: I am an annoyance to my wife and a burden to my daughter. Suddenly I realize what it feels like to be obsolete. I hope that you never have to learn what that feels like. Now, if you will excuse me, I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check on dinner. I'm not very hungry."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory walks past the video store, which her picture is in the window. As she stares at it, Jess walks over to her.]"
"JESS: Nice picture."
"RORY: Gee, thanks."
"JESS: You're very popular right now. I bet if you burn a few books, they'll probably make you mayor."
"RORY: This is ridiculous."
"JESS: I don't know, bet you have a lot of supporters on this. Pat Buchanon, Jerry Falwell, Kathie Lee Gifford."
"RORY: Bye."
"JESS: Aw, come on, it's a little funny."
"RORY: No, being the poster girl for censorship is not a little funny. The only videos not behind that curtain are Bambi and Dumbo. I mean, they actually had a meeting earlier about whether or not Babe should be behind the curtain so as not to offend people who keep kosher."
"JESS: It's a crazy world we live in."
"RORY: And where did they even find that stupid picture?"
"JESS: Oh no, the picture's good. It's the people who are stupid."
"RORY: I'm never gonna be able to leave my house again."
"JESS: Well, at least you won't starve."
"RORY: I can't look at it anymore."
"JESS: Relax. I don't think it'll be around very long."
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Just a guess."
"RORY: Jess!"
"JESS: Enjoy the food."
"RORY: Come back here."
"JESS: Why?"
"RORY: I'll give you an eggroll."
"JESS: Yes?"
"RORY: What did you do?"
"JESS: Nothing much. Just wanted to make sure whoever rented Dumbo or Bambi gets a little surprise."
"RORY: What kind of surprise? What did you do?"
"JESS: You owe me an eggroll. [walks away]"
"RORY: Blech."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Richard walks in the front door.]"
"EMILY: Richard, there you are, sneaking in like that."
"RICHARD: Hello Emily."
"EMILY: It's nice to see you."
"RICHARD: Well, you seem very happy."
"EMILY: Well, I had a very nice day. Would you like a drink?"
"RICHARD: Uh, no thanks."
"EMILY: I saw Cheeky Lennox today. She's redoing her entire house and I have to say, it's given me a few ideas about this place. I won't scare you with them tonight but I'm very excited about it."
"RICHARD: Well I'm glad."
"EMILY: Then I did a little shopping and I had my nails done."
"RICHARD: Very nice."
"EMILY: Sugar and spice, a little crazier than I usually wear but I don't know, I was just in that kind of a mood. So how was your day with the girls?"
"RICHARD: Wonderful."
"EMILY: Tell me about it."
"RICHARD: Well, I saw the town, I saw Lorelai's work."
"EMILY: Did you eat? Because I can have Heloise whip up something for you."
"RICHARD: No thank you, we had Chinese food."
"EMILY: Oh, you love Chinese food!"
"RICHARD: Yes I do."
"EMILY: Well I'm thrilled that you had such a wonderful time. It was good for you to get out like that."
"RICHARD: Yes it was. In fact, I'm still a little energized from the day, so I think I'm finally gonna organize all those stamps that I've been talking about for ages."
"EMILY: Now?"
"RICHARD: Why not?"
"EMILY: Well, I think that would be wonderful. Have fun."
"[Richard walks into his office and sits down]"

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[We see several signs near the gazebo promoting the upcoming Stars Hollow ""Bid on a Basket"" Fundraiser before we see Lorelai and Rory inside Doose's Market looking at baskets.]"
"LORELAI: So I've decided I'm saving myself for William Holden."
"RORY: Wow, it's nice out here in left field."
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm sorry. Sunset Boulevard was on last night, and I don't knowI've known him for years  Sabrina, Stalag 17  and yet last night something snapped."
"RORY: I'll say."
"LORELAI: I think it was the monkey scene."
"RORY: You know he's dead, don't you?"
"LORELAI: The monkey?"
"RORY: William Holden!"
"LORELAI: Ugh, every great relationship has its obstacles. You'd know that if you weren't dating Andy Hardy."
"RORY: This one?"
"LORELAI: Hm, no."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: It's too big, it raises expectations."
"RORY: Like there's actually a home-cooked lunch in there?"
"LORELAI: Instead of whatever is leftover in our refrigerator - exactly."
"RORY: Okay, going back on the pile now."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's quaint, isn't it? The women get to make a nice lunch basket, the men get to bid on it, and the world rotates backwards on its axis."
"RORY: I think it's fun."
"LORELAI: That's because you have a pretty boy to bid on your basket."
"RORY: Yes I do."
"LORELAI: Did you tell him to eat lunch first?"
"RORY: Hi, I love him, of course. Hey, I'm gonna look in the back."
"LORELAI: All right, I'll hit the front. [walks up front] Hey Patty. Shopping for baskets?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh please, I bought my basket weeks ago."
"LORELAI: Always prepared."
"MISS PATTY: Well, I'm getting that itch again."
"LORELAI: Oh no, Patty, you don't actually need another husband."
"MISS PATTY: Well, need  no, but want  that's a different story. Listen darling, do you happen to have change for a dollar?"
"LORELAI: I think so."
"MISS PATTY: I don't know where my quarters go."
"LORELAI: Down some guy's g-string, I would expect."
"MISS PATTY: Oh no, a quarter would be insulting."
"LORELAI: Here you go."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, thank you so. . . ugh! [drops something out of her wallet]"
"LORELAI: I got it. [bends down to pick it up]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh no no , that's okay."
"LORELAI: This is a picture of me."
"MISS PATTY: It is?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Why do you have a picture of me in your wallet?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, uh, well, it's a very nice picture."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Why do you have a very nice picture of me in your wallet?"
"MISS PATTY: I'm a stalker?"
"LORELAI: Or?"
"MISS PATTY: Or when, in my daily travels, I run across a nice single guy..."
"LORELAI: Oh God!"
"MISS PATTY: I like to have a visual aid to help me with the wonderful buildup I give you."
"LORELAI: Patty, I appreciate the gesture but I don't need you to try to set me up."
"MISS PATTY: You're such a beautiful girl and you deserve a nice guy."
"LORELAI: I'll have a nice guy, but let me find him, okay?"
"MISS PATTY: But you're no good at finding him."
"LORELAI: Patty."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, all right."
"LORELAI: Thank you. I'll keep this if you don't mind."
"MISS PATTY: Stubborn girl."
"[cut to Rory in the back looking at baskets. Dean walks up to her]"
"DEAN: Not that one."
"RORY: You get no say in the basket."
"DEAN: I have to bid on it."
"RORY: And you have to eat what's inside it and you get no say in that either."
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"DEAN: Is Taylor behind me?"
"RORY: No. [they kiss; a noise interrupts them]"
"DEAN: What? Taylor? [he turns around to look] Jess."
"JESS: Sorry to intrude."
"DEAN: Then why did you?"
"JESS: Well, you're having your vertical From Here to Eternity moment right in front of the super glue."
"RORY: Oh."
"JESS: Not that that's not an appropriate place to be doing it in front of but - ."
"DEAN: Here's your glue."
"JESS: Thanks. As you were. [walks away]"
"DEAN: I really hate that guy."
"RORY: He didn't do anything."
"DEAN: He's here, he's breathing, that's enough."
"RORY: I really wish you two could start over."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: Because he lives here and we run into him. He goes to school here. I just think it'd be easier."
"DEAN: I'm fine with the whole hating him thing, thank you."
"RORY: I just think it's a waste of energy."
"DEAN: You know, I'll have a PowerBar."
"RORY: Fine, forget it."
"DEAN: So, uh, I should probably get back to work. We still on for tonight?"
"RORY: I don't know. I might be baking."
"DEAN: I'll pick you up at seven. Get that one, it's nice and small."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Dean walks away; Jess walks back over and startles Rory]"
"RORY: God!"
"JESS: Sorry. Two for one sale."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is behind the front desk on the phone.]"
"LORELAI: Independence Inn, Lorelai speakingOh sure. Uh, what dates are you looking at? Hold on one sec. . . Um, would you like a king or a queen size bed? . . . Well, you have your choice. I've got a room with a king size and a room with two queens. . . Uh huh. . Oh, well, do you think you'll make up by then? . . . Ugh. Yikes, well, I would take the room with the two queens. . . Uh huh. . . Uh huh. . . Oh God! Uh, sorry, no, nothing, nothing's wrong. I. . everything's . .yes, great, call me back when you know. Okay. Thank you."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks through the door]"
"LORELAI: So Patty has taken it upon herself to find me a man."
"SOOKIE: Oh really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Here in my hand I have the pictures and resumes of the top three contenders."
"SOOKIE: Anyone good?"
"LORELAI: No, but two of them have run with the bulls. This is so humiliating. I can find my own man."
"SOOKIE: She just loves you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but . . .you know, ew!"
"SOOKIE: Ugh."
"[Jackson walks in]"
"JACKSON: Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, don't look!"
"JACKSON: What?"
"SOOKIE: Cover your eyes!"
"JACKSON: Okay, okay. I'm sorry, now why am I doing this?"
"SOOKIE: Because I'm baking for the picnic tomorrow and it's supposed to be a surprise."
"JACKSON: Oh sure, never see a pie before an auction, it's bad luck."
"LORELAI: Okay, uh, you guys talk, I have to go call Patty and stop the forced mating process. I feel like Ling-Ling the panda bear. Oh, hey, one of them's seen Ghostbusters 124 times. Can you say score? [leaves]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, what's up?"
"JACKSON: Well. . . I'm sorry, can I put my hand down? I need to look at you when I talk."
"SOOKIE: Uh, hold on. Go."
"JACKSON: I got a call from my landlord today reminding me that my lease is up at the end of this month."
"SOOKIE: Uh huh."
"JACKSON: So, of course, he wanted to know whether I was gonna re-up it or not."
"SOOKIE: Uh huh."
"JACKSON: But I told him that I had to talk to you first."
"SOOKIE: Okay. About what?"
"JACKSON: About re-upping my lease."
"SOOKIE: Mm hmm."
"JACKSON: So what do you think?"
"SOOKIE: About re-upping your lease?"
"JACKSON: Yes."
"SOOKIE: Well, you have a very nice kitchen."
"JACKSON: Yes, I know."
"SOOKIE: And I like your living room. Though that house across the street has sort of that creepy Miami Beach blue, which means that during the day you really can't look out your window, but at night it's not so bad."
"JACKSON: Sookie, forget about the house across the street."
"SOOKIE: Well, if you forget about the house across the street, I don't see why you shouldn't."
"JACKSON: You don't?"
"SOOKIE: Nope."
"JACKSON: Oh, okay, fine. Um, I just wanted to check with you first."
"SOOKIE: Oh, I appreciate that."
"JACKSON: So, um, I guess I'll go re-up my lease then."
"SOOKIE: Sounds good."
"JACKSON: Yeah. Sounds good."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[The day of the fundraiser, Lorelai and Rory walk down the street with their baskets]"
"LORELAI: You know what's wonderful about this festival?"
"RORY: No, what?"
"LORELAI: That it always falls on the day after trash day. Therefore, all the stuff that you forgot to throw out that you would normally be stuck with for another whole week, you can instead put in a pretty basket and auction off for charity."
"RORY: That is wonderful."
"[Lane runs up behind them]"
"LANE: Okay, I've got it all worked out."
"RORY: Tell please."
"LANE: Well, I invited my cousin David to come and bid on my basket, you know, to keep my mother happy."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"LANE: Then when he gets it, we tell my mom we're gonna go eat over at the park where Henry's gonna call on the pay phone at exactly two o'clock for the all is clear' sigh. Then David, with the twenty bucks I give him, will disappear, Henry will arrive, and we'll finally have out first official date."
"LORELAI: My head is spinning."
"LANE: Stash this at Miss Patty's for me, okay?"
"RORY: Don't you need this for David to bid on?"
"LANE: Oh no, my mom packed that one. You know, homemade granola, wheat grass juice, soy chicken taco."
"LORELAI: Suddenly our lunches are looking pretty good."
"LANE: This is the Henry basket. I went by Gianelli's and stopped in and picked up a couple of meatball heroes and some chips. I also packed a change of clothes, makeup, makeup remover, and three temporary tattoos."
"LORELAI: Sure, cause four would be trashy."
"LANE: I gotta go. I gotta sneak back into my house. Oh, I'm so excited! [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Ah man. I remember the days of lying to my mother about a boy. Once I had a boy hidden in the closet and of course Mom wouldn't leave, so I finally had to pretend to get sick to my stomach just to get her out of the room long enough for him to climb out the window and down the tree. He fell, broke his leg. Ah, to be young again."
"CUT TO AUCTION"
"[A crowd is gathered in front of the gazebo filled with baskets. Taylor stands at a podium in front as the auctioneer]"
"TAYLOR: Sold for fifteen dollars to the man in the yellow. Thank you very much. Now the next basket I have here is a lovely green wicker number that would be a charming addition to any room once the lunch is gone. Let's start the bidding at five dollars. Do I hear five?"
"DAVID: Five dollars."
"TAYLOR: Okay, I have five dollars. Do I hear ten?"
"KIRK: Ten dollars. [Mrs. Kim glares at him] Withdrawn."
"TAYLOR: Okay, I'm still at five, do I hear ten? Five going once, five going twice, sold to the young man for five dollars. You know what's nice, you can put a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper in there and stick it someplace in the bathroom  decorative and convenient. Now this next one may not look like much ..."
"RORY: Mine."
"LORELAI: Nice."
"TAYLOR: ... but remember people  good things come in small packages."
"LORELAI: How badly does he want to be hosting a game show?"
"RORY: Hm, he can taste it."
"TAYLOR: Let's start the bidding at three dollars."
"RORY: Hey!"
"DEAN: Five dollars."
"TAYLOR: Now that's the kind of bidding we want to hear today."
"LORELAI: He's good. He's very good."
"TAYLOR: Five dollars, do I hear ten dollars?"
"JESS: Ten dollars."
"TAYLOR: Okay, I have ten dollars. Do I have fifteen?"
"JESS: Twenty."
"TAYLOR: Twenty dollars, do I hear twenty-five?"
"DEAN: Thirty."
"TAYLOR: Okay, see, you boys don't seem to understand the way this thing works."
"JESS: Forty dollars."
"DEAN: Fifty dollars."
"TAYLOR: Excuse me, have either of you noticed how tiny this thing is?"
"JESS: Seventy-five."
"TAYLOR: Now we're not talking cents gentlemen, we're talking dollars remember."
"LORELAI: Uh oh. Dean's hesitating."
"DEAN: Eighty."
"RORY: He does not have eighty dollars to spend on that basket."
"TAYLOR: Eighty? Eighty dollars?"
"JESS: Ninety."
"TAYLOR: Ninety dollars, is that correct?"
"LORELAI: You know, I don't think he'll have to."
"TAYLOR: Okay, we've got ninety going once, ninety dollars going twice. . . sold to the nice young hoodlum in the back for ninety dollars."
"LORELAI: I'm trying to think, uh, in what scenario this situation could be construed as positive."
"RORY: Well . . ."
"LORELAI: Well, no one's head's on fire."
"RORY: I better go talk to Dean."
"LORELAI: Do you want some help?"
"RORY: No, it's okay. I'm just officially not a fan of unpredictability."
"LORELAI: I totally understand. Good luck."
"[Rory walks over to Dean as the auction goes on in the background]"
"TAYLOR: Five dollars on this one, do I hear five dollars?"
"MAN: Five!"
"TAYLOR: Five dollars, that's good. Thanks you, how about ten dollars?"
"MAN: I'll go ten!"
"TAYLOR: Ten dollars - let's keep going. Look at the size of this . . ."
"[cut to Rory and Dean talking behind the gazebo]"
"DEAN: I'm gonna k*ll him."
"RORY: Dean, he was probably just fooling around or something."
"DEAN: No, he was messing with me."
"RORY: I don't - ."
"DEAN: He was messing with me and it's the last time, I swear to God."
"RORY: Dean, calm down."
"DEAN: Why would he do this?"
"RORY: Maybe he was hungry."
"DEAN: He's trying to make me crazy."
"RORY: Just don't let him."
"[Jess walks up behind them]"
"JESS: I gotta tell you, of all the nutty barn raising shindigs this town can cook up, this one wasn't half bad."
"DEAN: Glad you enjoyed it."
"JESS: Yes I did. So shall we?"
"DEAN: Shall we what?"
"JESS: Shall we go?"
"DEAN: Go where?"
"JESS: Go eat."
"DEAN: Excuse me?"
"JESS: The person who buys the basket wins the company of the person who makes the basket for lunch. Basket, basket maker, guy who didn't bring enough money."
"DEAN: You think this is funny."
"JESS: Well, it's no Lenny Bruce routine but it has its moments."
"DEAN: Bye Jess."
"JESS: Where you going?"
"DEAN: You're the one who's going."
"JESS: Oh, as soon as Rory is ready."
"DEAN: She's not going with you."
"JESS: Really, is that true?"
"DEAN: Yes, it's true."
"JESS: Excuse me Edgar Bergen, I think I'd like Charlie McCarthy to answer now."
"DEAN: Shut up."
"RORY: Dean."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: Well"
"DEAN: Oh, come on!"
"RORY: It's tradition."
"DEAN: I don't believe this."
"RORY: It's true. My mother and I have been doing this every year since we moved here."
"DEAN: So buck tradition."
"RORY: Are you kidding? Do you remember how mad Taylor was when I was sick and I couldn't go to the turkey-calling contest?"
"DEAN: This isn't school, you're not getting graded."
"RORY: Just don't make this into a big thing."
"DEAN: Don't go."
"JESS: Oh geez man, she's not shipping off to Nam."
"DEAN: You SO need to shut up now."
"RORY: Look, Dean, it's a picnic, it's lunch. We'll sit, we'll eat, it's over."
"DEAN: No."
"RORY: What do you think's gonna happen?"
"JESS: Yeah, I think I'd like to hear this one also."
"DEAN: I don't want you to go."
"RORY: Dean!"
"DEAN: Fine, forget it, go. [walks away]"
"RORY: [follows him] Please don't walk away like that."
"DEAN: Sorry, I'd do a silly walk but I'm not feeling very John Cleese right now."
"RORY: Dean, this isn't my fault. I didn't ask him to do that, I didn't tell him to do that. Dean, you're my boyfriend. I would never do anything to hurt you."
"DEAN: Yeah? You're doing it right now. [walks away]"
"CUT TO AUCTION"
"TAYLOR: Going once, going twice. . .sold for twenty-five dollars! Congratulations. Thank you. Oh Lord, will you look at this? Ladies and gentlemen, now this is a basket."
"[Sookie mouths to Jackson That's my basket']"
"TAYLOR: Let's start the bidding on this delicious treat at ten dollars. Do I hear ten dollars?"
"KIRK: Ten dollars."
"ANDREW: Fifteen dollars."
"TAYLOR: I have fifteen dollars."
"KIRK: Twenty dollars."
"TAYLOR: Twenty dollars, I have twenty dollars. Is that my final offer?"
"KIRK: All right, fine, twenty-five."
"TAYLOR: Kirk, you just offered twenty, you upped your own bid."
"SOOKIE: Im sorry, can we stop the bidding for just a second?"
"TAYLOR: Sookie, you know the rules."
"SOOKIE: Yes, but I  ."
"TAYLOR: We have twenty-five dollars. Do I hear thirty?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson."
"ANDREW: Thirty, if there's pie."
"TAYLOR: There are no contingencies Andrew."
"KIRK: Thirty-five."
"TAYLOR: Andrew?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson?"
"ANDREW: I'm not going any higher without the promise of pie."
"TAYLOR: Thirty-five going once, thirty-five going twice. . .sold to Kirk for thirty-five dollars."
"KIRK: Yes, finally! You know, if it hadn't have been for me I could've had it for twenty-five."
"[Sookie and Jackson walk away from the crowd]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, what is wrong with you? I gave you all the signals. The pointing, the waving, the mouthing That's my basket.' Didn't you see the mouthing?"
"JACKSON: Yes, I saw the mouthing."
"SOOKIE: Well, why didn't you bid?"
"JACKSON: I don't know. It just didn't feel right."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about, it didn't feel right? I made four kinds of pesto and three different desserts. Plus the entire basket is an edible pretzel with a goat cheese filling."
"JACKSON: Well, I hope Kirk enjoys it."
"SOOKIE: I don't understand."
"JACKSON: Oh, come on Sookie."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"JACKSON: I told you that the lease was up on my apartment, and I asked you if you thought that I should renew the lease on my apartment and you said yes!"
"SOOKIE: Do you not like that apartment?"
"JACKSON: No, I love that apartment. It's perfect, the ultimate bachelor pad. It's just big enough for one."
"SOOKIE: Oh."
"JACKSON: Only here's the thing. You and I, we've been dating for awhile and I don't know, I thought things were going pretty well."
"SOOKIE: Things are going really well."
"JACKSON: Okay, so I had this crazy thought that since things were going really well that maybe it was time to take a step forward."
"SOOKIE: You wanted to move in together?"
"JACKSON: Well, I at least wanted to consider moving in together."
"SOOKIE: Oh, uh, I hadn't even thought about it."
"JACKSON: You hadn't?"
"SOOKIE: Well, no."
"JACKSON: Oh, my mistake then. I thought we were on the same wavelength. We weren't, no problem, enjoy your lunch."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, I lied. I have thought about it - a lot. Our bathroom's gonna be pink. I'm sorry."
"JACKSON: Well, why didn't you say something?"
"SOOKIE: I didn't want to ruin anything. We're doing so well, we have so much fun, it's all working."
"JACKSON: Why would living together mess all that up?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. We'd see each other every day."
"JACKSON: We see each other every day now."
"SOOKIE: And you'd find out all my annoying little quirks."
"JACKSON: Hey, I've got annoying quirks too, you know."
"SOOKIE: I know."
"JACKSON: What's that supposed to mean?"
"SOOKIE: And you might get sick of me."
"JACKSON: Or you might get sick of me."
"SOOKIE: No, that's not gonna happen."
"JACKSON: Well, if that's not gonna happen, then what's the problem?"
"SOOKIE: The problem is that Kirk is gonna eat my goat cheese basket."
"JACKSON: Not if I have anything to say about it. [they kiss] How's that for not getting sick of you? Now if you'll excuse me, I got a basket to get."
"[cut back to auction]"
"TAYLOR: Next up  why, that looks like a Doose's market basket. Nice, huh?"
"LORELAI: Ooh, that's mine."
"TAYLOR: I'd like to start the bidding at five dollars."
"GUY 1: I bid five dollars."
"LORELAI: Whoa, that was quick."
"GUY 2: Ten dollars."
"LORELAI: Do they know that all that's in there is two stale Pop Tarts and a Slim Jim?"
"GUY 3: Fifteen dollars."
"LORELAI: He looks familiar."
"GUY 1: Twenty dollars."
"TAYLOR: Twenty dollars."
"LORELAI: So does he."
"GUY 2: Twenty-five."
"TAYLOR: This is going very well gentlemen, keep it up."
"LORELAI: Oh no. [walks over to Miss Patty] Those are the guys, aren't they?"
"MISS PATTY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: The guys whose pictures you sent me - you brought them here! You're setting me up!"
"MISS PATTY: Well darling, you can't be trusted to do it yourself."
"LORELAI: Oh geez, oh geez!"
"GUY 2: Thirty-five."
"MISS PATTY: That one's a snorkler."
"LORELAI: Ugh! [runs away]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai bursts through the door]"
"LORELAI: Luke! Where is he, where is he? I need him! Caesar, where is - agh, agh, thank God. Hey, hey, you gotta come with me."
"LUKE: What are you doing? Hey hey, I got plates here!"
"LORELAI: Put the burgers down. Caeser, you're in charge."
"LUKE: Now wait."
"LORELAI: Do you have money? I need money. Which one opens this thing? Is it that one, not that one."
"LUKE: Stop messing with that."
"LORELAI: Luke, you gotta come out there with me. Patty gave my picture out to all these guys because she thinks I need a man."
"LUKE: You do, one with a nice couch and a deep knowledge of Freud."
"LORELAI: You have to come out and bid on my basket."
"LUKE: Are you serious?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LUKE: I have never in my life taken part in one of these crazy group flip outs. I'm not about to start now."
"LORELAI: But - right now - out there  the -."
"LUKE: Just buy your own basket."
"LORELAI: I cannot buy my own basket."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because that is pathetic."
"LUKE: And chasing me around my diner begging me to buy your basket?"
"LORELAI: Also pathetic. But that is a pathetic I can live with, where that pathetic is a truly pathetic pathetic, and only you can save me from the double pathetic! Please!"
"LUKE: I can't believe I'm doing this."
"LORELAI: Ha ha! Hurry up. Hurry up!"
"[Lorelai rushes him out the door]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Luke walk up to the crowd]"
"GUY 1: Forty-five fifty."
"GUY 2: Forty-six."
"GUY 3: Forty-six fifty."
"GUY 1: Forty-seven."
"LORELAI: Go, go on."
"LUKE: Forty-seven dollars, are you kidding?"
"LORELAI: Luke!"
"GUY 2: Forty-seven fifty!"
"LUKE: For what? Two stale Pop Tarts and a Slim Jim?"
"LORELAI: Okay, you're not getting the whole saving me here thing, are you?"
"LUKE: Fine. Forty-eight."
"GUY 1: Forty-eight fifty."
"LUKE: Forty-nine."
"GUY 2: Forty-nine fifty."
"LUKE: Uh, fifty-two fifty."
"GUY 1: What? We're just supposed to go to fifty."
"LUKE: I have a life."
"LORELAI: Fifty-two fifty going once!"
"TAYLOR: Hey, hey, that's my job! Fifty-two fifty going once, fifty-two fifty going twice . . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, please God."
"TAYLOR: Sold for fifty-two fifty."
"LORELAI: Yes! Ha, ha, sorry guys, don't feel bad. I'm totally into Dungeons and Dragons. You've skated."
"TAYLOR: And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the basket bidding for today. Victors come claim your prizes and your dates. Let the lunching begin!"
"LORELAI: You rock!"
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"LUKE: So what do we do now?"
"LORELAI: I guess we eat."
"LUKE: This?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: First I have to buy it, then I have to eat it?"
"LORELAI: Hey, the basket of botulism does come with my company."
"LUKE: Huh. You don't eat with your mouth open do you?"
"LORELAI: Women don't eat at all. We just look at food and jump on the treadmill."
"LUKE: All right, let's go."
"[cut to Rory standing alone as Jess walks up to her]"
"JESS: You know, there's nothing there."

"RORY: Fine, come on."
"CUT TO BENCH"
"[Kirk is going through Sookie's basket as Jackson walks over to him]"
"JACKSON: I've been looking all over for you."
"KIRK: Any idea what this is?"
"JACKSON: Uh, yeah, it's a pineapplecranberry chutney."
"KIRK: Ech."
"JACKSON: Listen, I'd like to talk to you about this basket. As you know, Sookie made it and since Sookie and I are seeing each other, naturally she assumed that I would bid on it."
"KIRK: Where are the carrot sticks? Every lunch has carrot sticks."
"JACKSON: But see, I was a little upset about a fight we had had, and so I didn't bid on the basket."
"KIRK: I love carrot sticks, especially the crinkle cut kind."
"JACKSON: However, we just made up and now I'd like to have lunch with Sookie, so. . . I need the basket."
"KIRK: This is my basket."
"JACKSON: Yes, but I'd like you to give it to me so that I can have lunch with Sookie."
"KIRK: I bought this basket. The rules are whoever bids the highest gets to keep the basket."
"JACKSON: Yeah, I understand the rules but - ."
"KIRK: I bid the highest, I bought the basket, I get the basket."
"JACKSON: Okay Kirk, I'll pay you for it. I'll give you forty-five dollars, that's ten dollars more than you paid for it."
"KIRK: No."
"JACKSON: Okay, fifty dollars."
"KIRK: No."
"JACKSON: Kirk, this is insane. I'll buy you another basket."
"KIRK: I don't need you to buy me another basket. I won this one. You can't just come by and take it away. Just because you have a girlfriend and she made this basket for you doesn't give you the right to bully those of us who don't have girlfriends or anybody to make a basket for them."
"JACKSON: Well, I wasn't trying to bully you."
"KIRK: Not this year, not last year, not the year before that."
"JACKSON: Okay Kirk."
"KIRK: My mother didn't even make one for me."
"JACKSON: Oh, that's very sad."
"KIRK: She made one for all my brothers and sisters but not for me."
"JACKSON: That's terrible, Kirk."
"KIRK: Twelve brothers and sisters, the only one without a basket  me."
"JACKSON: Okay Kirk, what's it gonna take?"
"KIRK: Two hundred and fifty dollars."
"JACKSON: Kirk, you're kidding me."
"KIRK: Twelve brothers and sisters."
"JACKSON: Will you take a check?"
"KIRK: With two forms of ID."
"JACKSON: I swear, you better be as pathetic as you sound."
"KIRK: Oh, trust me"

"DAVID: Great, can I have his lunch now?"
"LANE: I'll be right back."
"CUT TO GAZEBO"
"[Lorelai and Luke sit on the bench]"
"LORELAI: We're supposed to be eating on the ground."
"LUKE: Says who?"
"LORELAI: Every picture you've ever seen of a picnic shows people eating on the ground."
"LUKE: Yes, and every time I have seen a picture of people eating on the ground I've thought, what the hell are you people doing sitting on the ground? Spring for some beach chairs, you cheapskates."
"[Lane runs up into the gazebo]"
"LANE: Hey Lorelai, do you have your cell phone?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, is everything okay hon?"
"LANE: I just need to make a call."
"LORELAI: Here you go."
"LANE: I'll be right back."
"[Lane walks away as Luke stands up]"
"LORELAI: Hey, where are you going?"
"LUKE: I am going to the diner, I am going to get us some edible food and I'm gonna bring it back here for us to eat."
"LORELAI: That is so not the point of today. I made this. I am insulted. I will now proceed to pout."

"LANE: What, you what?"
"HENRY: I called your house and your mother answered."
"LANE: What did you say?"
"HENRY: I asked for you and then she asked why, and I said because and she said because why, and I got nervous and tried to sell her a subscription to the Wall Street Journal."
"LANE: Oh, were you successful?"
"HENRY: Lane."
"LANE: Sorry, but at least she doesn't know, right?"
"HENRY: I guess not."
"LANE: Okay, then we're still good. Can you meet me now?"
"HENRY: I don't know."
"LANE: I know it's later than we planned, but we still have a little time and I saved your lunch from David."
"HENRY: David?"
"LANE: My cousin, the decoy."
"HENRY: Oh, right."
"LANE: So we'll rendezvous where I told you. Just drive by, honk twice, go around the block, and the second time you pass I'll jump in the car."
"HENRY: Gee, do you even want me to slow down?"
"LANE: Well yeah, of course. I mean, not to a total stop -."
"HENRY: Lane, I don't think this is gonna work out."
"LANE: What"
"HENRY: This - you, me."
"LANE: Are you breaking up with me?"
"HENRY: How can I break up with you? I've never been out with you."
"LANE: Well yeah, but that's what today was supposed to be, a date."
"HENRY: A date where we need a secret plan and a two-honk driveby and a decoy cousin?"
"LANE: Well, yeah."
"HENRY: Lane, I like you but I want to be able to actually pick you up, stop the car, and take you out. And I wanna be able to call you, at your house."
"LANE: I'm gonna tell my mother, I promise."
"HENRY: When?"
"LANE: Soon."
"HENRY: Yeah. Look, I've got prom coming up and my friends and I are gonna rent a limo to take us there and I wanna go, and I wanna take a date."
"LANE: Well, I'm sure I can figure something out. Maybe Rory can  ."
"HENRY: I asked somebody else."
"LANE: Oh."
"HENRY: I'm sorry, I just figured you'd never be able to go and - ."
"LANE: No, it's okay, that's good. You should've asked someone else."
"HENRY: I do like you Lane."

"LANE: Who?"
"MRS. KIM: The boy you ran off to see! The one who calls here pretending to work for the Wall Street Journal!"
"LANE: There's no boy."
"MRS. KIM: You know the rules, no boys! Not unless I approve and I don't approve!"
"LANE: How do you know?"
"MRS. KIM: I know, I know! You're sneaking, you're lying, that means something's wrong with this boy!"
"LANE: There's nothing wrong with this boy. He's perfect and he likes me and I was so afraid to tell you about him that now he's gonna take somebody else to the prom and I blew it!"

"JESS: No underwater dining, got it."
"RORY: Now what?"
"JESS: Now we sit."
"RORY: Here?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: On the bridge, that's where we're gonna eat?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: Okay."
"JESS: Yeah, I like this place."
"RORY: Wow. A place in Stars Hollow you actually like. I'm stunned."
"JESS: It's got some good memories. You see right over there?"
"RORY: Yup."
"JESS: That's where Luke pushed me in."
"RORY: Huh."
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: It's nice."
"JESS: It is."
"RORY: So why'd you do it?"
"JESS: Do what?"
"RORY: Outbid Dean like that."
"JESS: I don't know. I guess it started as a joke just to bug him, but then he just got so mad, you know? And he is so tall, and I just was looking at him and he's standing there all tall and mad and I just. . .I don't know. It was. . .it was really funny."
"RORY: It wasn't funny."
"JESS: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I didn't intend to do it. Does that make you feel any better?"
"RORY: I just don't wanna be in a fight with Dean."
"JESS: I'm sorry about that. You wanna push me in the lake? It's cathartic, I hear."
"RORY: Hm, maybe in a little."
"JESS: Whatever. So why don't we open this thing?"
"RORY: Go ahead."
"[Jess opens the picnic basket]"
"JESS: Wow. Not one thing in here that I would remotely consider eating."
"RORY: Well, I didn't make it for you. I made it for Dean."
"JESS: And Dean would've eaten this? [holds up a container]"
"RORY: Yes, he would have."

"SOOKIE: I'm glad we made up."
"JACKSON: Yeah, me too."
"SOOKIE: And you know, if you still wanted to talk about, you know, what we were talking about, we could talk about it now."
"JACKSON: Hmm, nah."
"SOOKIE: Excuse me?"
"JACKSON: I don't know. I'm having second thoughts."
"SOOKIE: You are?"
"JACKSON: Yeah. I mean, living together - big deal, right?"
"SOOKIE: Oh right. Big deal. Who cares? Not me. No siree, Bob. So, I'm sorry, you don't think we should live together anymore?"
"JACKSON: Nope."
"SOOKIE: Okay."

"[Cut to Luke and Lorelai sitting in the gazebo]"
"LORELAI: You know, your burgers actually taste better outside."

"LORELAI: So this is nice, huh? Come on, admit it."
"LUKE: Never."
"LORELAI: What? Admit it, you would much rather be sitting out here than inside working."
"LUKE: The diner's probably on fire by now."
"LORELAI: You are stubborn."
"LUKE: I'm stubborn?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, you're stubborn."
"LUKE: You're Miss Flexibility over here?"
"LORELAI: Hey, I can be flexible."

"LUKE: You want a carrot?"
"LORELAI: Impossible."
"LUKE: Right back at ya. So let me ask you something."
"LORELAI: Napkin, please."
"LUKE: Who did you want to get your basket?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: I mean, before you knew Patty was gonna put you on the Dating Game, you did pack this disgusting lunch and bring it out here, so who did you want to get it?"
"LORELAI: Well, last year Roy Wilkins bought it and I got my sprinklers fixed for half price."
"LUKE: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: And this year my rain gutters are completely clogged, and I thought if I could get the Collins kid to bite, I'd get that taken care of."
"LUKE: Very practical."
"LORELAI: I thought so."
"LUKE: So the participation in this thing was purely for home improvement reasons?"
"LORELAI: Yes. And I don't know, it's a nice concept."
"LUKE: What is?"
"LORELAI: Just having someone who you love or have some kind of crazy crush on bid on your basket and then share a romantic lunch, it's a nice concept."
"LUKE: Well, I'm sure someday you'll manage to find the right guy and drag him out to this thing and make him by your stupid basket and then you'll be sitting out here with him."
"LORELAI: Yeah, someday."
"LUKE: You know what?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: This is nice."

"DEAN: Uh, I'm not great."
"LORELAI: Aw, Dean, it's just a silly town thing."
"DEAN: I know, and I've been telling myself that and I tried to go home and forget about it, but I can't. I'm worried about Rory. I don't think she should be hanging out with this guy."
"LORELAI: Well, I know that today was kind of a. . ."
"DEAN: It's got nothing to do with today. I mean, yes, it has a little to do with today but it's more than that. Ever since I've met him, I've had this feeling that he was bad news."
"LORELAI: Yes, Jess has a few issues."
"DEAN: Yeah, one issue is that he's a complete jerk. I mean, he's always getting in fights at school. That is, when he bothers to show up at all. And he's just. . . I don't know. And now this whole thing with Rory, it's like he's always around."
"LORELAI: You sound jealous."
"DEAN: I'm not jealous. He just. . . she has to be nice to everyone, you know?"
"LORELAI: I know. But hon, that's Rory."
"DEAN: Well, he's gonna get her into trouble. I can feel it, I just know it. And he doesn't care about her, he's just using her to drive me crazy."
"LORELAI: Dean, you love Rory, right?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"LORELAI: So, part of love is trust. You just have to trust her."
"DEAN: I do trust her, it's - ."
"LORELAI: Him, I know. But flying off the handle like this is not gonna get you what you want. She cares about you, she's not gonna do anything to mess things up with you guys. I know this."

"[cut to Rory and Jess on the bridge]"
"RORY: Ten."
"JESS: Ten?"
"RORY: Yeah but I didn't understand a word of it, so I had to reread it when I was fifteen."
"JESS: I've yet to make it through it."
"RORY: Really? Try it. The Fountainhead is classic."
"JESS: Yeah, but Ayn Rand is a political nut."
"RORY: Yeah, but nobody could write a forty page monologue the way that she could."
"JESS: Okay, tomorrow I will try again, and you will. . ."
"RORY: Give the painful Ernest Hemingway another chance. Yes, I promise."
"JESS: You know, Ernest only has lovely things to say about you."
"RORY: Why are you only nice to me?"
"JESS: Excuse me?"
"RORY: An hour ago you were totally screwing with Dean and now you're totally nice to me."
"JESS: You see, it's the screwing with Dean - that's an important step to getting here so that I can be nice to you."
"RORY: So it was a plan."
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: The whole bidding on my basket, it was a plan."
"JESS: Okay, I'm officially starving."
"RORY: And officially evasive."
"JESS: Come on, I'll get you a pizza."
"RORY: Answer my question."
"JESS: Do you like pepperoni?"
"RORY: Not going to, are you?"
"JESS: We can just get it on half if you want."
"RORY: Okay, I give, let's go."
"JESS: If you insist."
"[Rory walks away, not realizing her bracelet had fallen off. Jess picks it up and puts it in his pocket.]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch as Rory walks in the front door]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. Where've you been? I thought Taylor auctioned you off to the highest bidder."
"RORY: No, I just went to get some pizza and I, uh, wandered around the bookstore for a little while. Here. [hands her a book]"
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"RORY: You said you wanted to read the Children's Hour."
"LORELAI: I did?"
"RORY: The other night when we were watching Julia, and Jane Fonda was playing Lillian Hellman."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, and I made the Hellmann's mayonnaise joke."
"RORY: Which no one ever needs to hear again."
"LORELAI: Right, right. Well, thanks."
"RORY: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: So who were you with?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Pizza, book buying - did you have company?"
"RORY: Oh, yeah."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: Um, Jess."
"LORELAI: Jess?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: So, I'll be in my room."
"LORELAI: Okay, good."
"[Lorelai follows Rory into her room]"
"LORELAI: So how was the picnic?"
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Good. Did you get the Dean issue resolved?"
"RORY: Not yet. He's coming over later and we're gonna smooth things over hopefully."
"LORELAI: Aw, yeah, well, smoothing's good. I love the smoothing. So, how was it with Jess?"
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Well obviously, the pizza and the books. So good, that's. . .I'm glad."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: What what?"
"RORY: Well, you look like you have something to say."
"LORELAI: I have nothing to say. I never have anything to say."
"RORY: Yes, that is your reputation."
"LORELAI: It's. . .I don't know. I'm just surprised that you're hanging out with him, that's all."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: He doesn't seem like the nicest kid."
"RORY: Well, you don't know him."
"LORELAI: No, I guess not."
"RORY: You're just judging him by that one time that he came over here."
"LORELAI: Which, by the way, was not a rousing success."
"RORY: He had just moved here. He was mad at his mom. Trust me, he's got a really good side to him. You'll see it eventually."
"LORELAI: Good, I can't wait."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No, well, I'm sorry. It's. . I just, uh, I don't know. From the things I've seen and the things I hear. . ."
"RORY: Like what things?"
"LORELAI: The vandalism, the stealing, the cutting school, the fighting."
"RORY: How do you know about the fighting?"
"LORELAI: Well, Dean told me."
"RORY: Dean?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: You've been discussing this with Dean?"
"LORELAI: No, he discussed it with me."
"RORY: When?"
"LORELAI: Today. Rory, he's really upset about this."
"RORY: So he went running to my mother?"
"LORELAI: Well, he needed someone to talk to."
"RORY: Well, he could've talked to me."
"LORELAI: No, he couldn't cause you were off with Jess."
"RORY: You're taking his side?"
"LORELAI: I'm not taking sides here, okay? I'm Swiss, babe."
"RORY: I wasn't off with Jess. I. . .Jess outbid him."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: Well, the rule is that if one person outbids someone else, then. . ."
"LORELAI: Rory, this is not about the rule. I know what the rule is. This is about Dean being concerned that you're hanging out with someone who can get you hurt."
"RORY: How could Jess get me hurt?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, hon. In the short amount of time he's been here, he's managed to make a lot of enemies."
"RORY: I'm sorry, when did I move to Salem?"
"LORELAI: People are concerned about you, you know? You're young and naïve and you think that everyone has some good inside if you give them a chance."
"RORY: So you're saying that Jess is no good?"
"LORELAI: I've known guys like Jess. He seems cool because he's got this dangerous vibe and this problem with authority and he's seen a lot of Sylvester Stallone movies."
"RORY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: But guys like this get into trouble which, if you hang out with them, gets you into trouble and I don't want you to get into trouble."
"RORY: I'm sorry, are we talking about Dean still or are we suddenly talking about you?"
"LORELAI: Hey, I've been there, okay? You haven't."
"RORY: Been where? I mean, we got pizza, we looked at some books. God, I can't even believe that I'm having this conversation with you. I mean, with you of all people. I mean. . . I don't even want to talk about this anymore."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: No, I'm going for a walk."
"LORELAI: Uh, Dean is gonna be here any minute."
"RORY: Well, he probably wants to talk to you anyhow."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner.]"
"EMILY: A cigar club. Can you imagine a more disgusting organization to join? Your grandfather now pays money to sit in an enclosed room with a bunch of other men and blow smoke in each other's faces. Twice a week he comes home smelling like a flophouse. So I finally just confronted him. I said, Richard, I know you're going through a transitional period here and I encourage your trying out new things, but this seems completely out of character for you.' I'm sorry, am I boring you?"
"LORELAI: No, you're not."
"RORY: Sorry Grandma."
"EMILY: So how are things at the inn?"
"LORELAI: Fine, the same."
"EMILY: And Rory, how's that boyfriend of yours?"
"RORY: Apparently very chatty."
"EMILY: Well that's nice. Lorelai, anything new with you?"
"LORELAI: No, nothing. It's been pretty quiet around the house lately."
"EMILY: Well, sometimes quiet can be nice. Soothing. You can hear yourself think. All right, what's going on with you too?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"EMILY: It's not nothing. You've both been sitting here all night, not saying a word and not even looking at each other. Are you in a fight?"
"LORELAI: I'm not."
"RORY: Please."
"LORELAI: Please what? You are the one who's been freezing me out all week."
"RORY: I just haven't had anything to say. [her pager goes off]"
"LORELAI: Who is it?"
"RORY: No one."
"LORELAI: Why won't you tell me who?"
"RORY: Cause it's no one."
"LORELAI: Is it Jess?"
"RORY: You're kidding, right?"
"EMILY: Jess, who's Jess?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not kidding."
"RORY: Why would you automatically assume that it's Jess?"
"LORELAI: Because why won't you tell me who it is?"
"EMILY: Who's Jess?"
"LORELAI: Luke's nephew."
"RORY: It's not Jess, okay? It's Dean. You wanna read it? Oh wait, no. Dean will probably tell you all about it later."
"LORELAI: That's not funny. You know, all week you've been - ."
"RORY: We're not getting into this again."
"EMILY: What? Getting into what? Is it about this Jess the thing you're not getting into again?"
"RORY: You know, you never liked Dean at the beginning."
"LORELAI: That's because I didn't know him."
"RORY: And now you don't like Jess?"
"LORELAI: That's because I know him."
"EMILY: Are you dating Jess? What happened to Dean?"
"RORY: I'm not dating Jess."
"LORELAI: No, but he's trying to weasel his way in."
"RORY: He's not trying to weasel his way."
"EMILY: In where?"
"LORELAI: In Rory's world. He has his eye on her, and he's trouble."
"RORY: He's not trouble."
"LORELAI: Yes he is."
"EMILY: Rory, if your mother thinks this boy isn't appropriate company for you then you need to listen to her."
"LORELAI: There, thank you Mom."
"RORY: Excuse me, but I don't feel very hungry right now. [leaves table]"
"CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY"
"[Rory walks in and shuts the door. She sits down, then walks over to the phone and dials]"
"MRS. KIM: Kim's Antiques, we're closed, call tomorrow."
"RORY: Mrs. Kim, it's Rory."
"MRS. KIM: It's after nine."
"RORY: I know."
"MRS. KIM: Lane can't talk after nine."
"RORY: Mrs. Kim, I promise I will never again call Lane after nine, but can I please just talk to her now? Just this once?"
"MRS. KIM: Okay, just this once."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[Mrs. Kim walks up to Lane's room]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane?"
"LANE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: Phone."
"LANE: But it's after nine."
"MRS. KIM: It's okay, it's Rory."
"LANE: I don't want to talk right now."
"MRS. KIM: Rory?"
"RORY: Yes?"
"MRS. KIM: Lane's not feeling well, she needs to call you tomorrow."
"RORY: Oh, okay. Um, thanks anyhow."
"MRS. KIM: Yes, goodbye. [hangs up] Lane!"
"[she walks into Lane's room]"
"MRS. KIM: It's early for you to be in bed."
"LANE: I'm tired."
"MRS. KIM: Come downstairs and have some tea."
"LANE: No, thank you."
"MRS. KIM: I know you're upset but I have these rules for a reason. I'm your mother, I know what's best for you."
"LANE: Can we talk about this tomorrow please?"
"MRS. KIM: You see, this is exactly why I make these rules. You're too young, too vulnerable. American boys have different values, they don't understand respect, you get hurt. I do all of this so you don't get hurt and now here you are hurt. I don't like this, I don't like this at all. Who is he, this boy who hurt you?"
"LANE: Henry Cho."
"MRS. KIM: Cho?"
"LANE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: Cho sounds Korean."
"LANE: It is Korean."
"MRS. KIM: He was Korean?"
"LANE: Yes, and he was smart and wonderful and cute."
"MRS. KIM: And  and you're sure he was Korean?"
"LANE: He's gonna be a doctor, he goes to church, he's a counselor at Bible camp, and he liked me."
"MRS. KIM: A doctor."
"LANE: I'm so stupid. I should've just told you and I didn't and now he's gone and I'm just stupid."
"MRS. KIM: Maybe I can call his mother."
"LANE: I don't want to talk about this anymore."
"MRS. KIM: You're sure he was Korean?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Emily sit at the table]"
"LORELAI: I swear Mom, there's just something about that kid that. . .ugh, I don't know. And I hate it because he's Luke's nephew and Rory likes him but. . ."
"EMILY: You are her mother Lorelai. You must set boundaries and restrictions, it's your job."
"LORELAI: I wanted to like him but I just couldn't, and Rory can't see it."
"EMILY: Well, she's young."
"LORELAI: And she won't take my word for it."
"EMILY: Well, she's young."
"LORELAI: I don't know what to do. Maybe I'm overreacting."
"EMILY: Lorelai, listen to me. Now I don't say this to you very often, but on this matter I happen to agree with you one hundred percent."
"LORELAI: Gee, thanks Mom."
"EMILY: I know Rory's a good girl, but good girls can go bad with the wrong influences. We all know that."
"LORELAI: Oh no no, I don't think Rory's actually gonna go bad."
"EMILY: Don't back down Lorelai. You took a stand and you are completely in the right here. You absolutely must keep her from that boy. If you need to change her curfew, lock her up, throw away the key, whatever it takes to make sure she doesn't go astray - you do it. Her judgment cannot be trusted here. She's a young girl and knows nothing. You are her eyes and her ears and her brain for as long as it takes to make sure she doesn't make any ridiculous choices in her life."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Would you excuse me for a sec?"
"CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY"
"[Lorelai pushes open the door]"
"LORELAI: Hey, can I come in?"
"RORY: It's not my house, I can't stop you."
"LORELAI: Just listen to me for one second okay? No sighing, just let me talk."
"RORY: Go ahead."
"LORELAI: I don't wanna lock you up and throw away the key."
"RORY: Well good."
"LORELAI: Your judgment means something, especially to me. I can't be your eyes and your ears and your brain."
"RORY: I'm trying really hard to connect the dots here."
"LORELAI: I got spooked. I know it violates the fabulous cool mom clause we're supposed to have going but I did and I'm sorry."
"RORY: It's okay."
"LORELAI: Now, I am concerned about Jess."
"RORY: Well, you shouldn't be."
"LORELAI: But I am. However, you are a smart girl, you're a good judge of character, and the fact that he seems to like you gives him a couple of brownie points. You're not a little kid. I don't actually think you ever were a little kid."
"RORY: I was, for about a month."
"LORELAI: If you think he's a decent guy, I have to respect your judgment."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: But I'm asking you to be careful."
"RORY: I will."
"LORELAI: Really careful."
"RORY: I will."
"LORELAI: Boy in the plastic bubble' kind of careful."
"RORY: I promise."
"LORELAI: And you have to cut Dean some slack. He's so crazy about you. He didn't mean anything by coming to me. He just wigged."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: So, fight over?"
"RORY: Fight over."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: You still don't look okay."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, my mother agreed with me tonight."
"RORY: I'm so sorry."
"LORELAI: Thank you, I appreciate that."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door.]"
"LORELAI: I need a shower."
"RORY: Don't be so dramatic."
"LORELAI: I agree with you a hundred percent.' Ugh!"
"RORY: Go upstairs."
"LORELAI: Find a movie, I'll be down in a minute."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: I agree with you a hundred percent.' I may have to shave my head also."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Rory takes the phone into her room and dials a number]"
"JESS: Hello?"
"RORY: Hi."
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"JESS: Nothing, you?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"JESS: Why'd you call?"
"RORY: I . . um, I wanted to. . ."
"JESS: I'm glad you called."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Because maybe you can explain what the hell this crazy woman is talking about."
"RORY: Ah, The Fountainhead."
"JESS: Yes. Your fault, and you will pay."
"RORY: I promise. Commit to it one more time and if it still is awful for you, I will make it up to you."
"JESS: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Okay. I'm gonna hold you to that."

"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street towards Luke's]"
"LORELAI: But my question is, how did that happen? How was it that suddenly everyone in the world was saying music has charms to soothe the savage beast' when it was written breast."
"RORY: I don't know. At some point someone misspoke and it just caught on."
"LORELAI: How do things like that catch on?"
"RORY: Mom, please, you're driving me crazy."
"LORELAI: I mean, did some guy like say it at a big rally of some sort and everyone went home and started saying it that way and then it just spread from there?"
"RORY: Yes, exactly."
"LORELAI: Oh, now you're just trying to shut me up."
"[they walk into Luke's Diner, no one's in there except Luke]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Look."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Empty."
"LUKE: Just one of those weird lulls, happens occasionally."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"RORY: Can we sit wherever we like?"
"LUKE: Wherever you like."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Such luxury I never dreamed of."
"RORY: Where do you wanna sit?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Um, how bout this table with it's unobstructed westward view of the wide cosmopolitan expansive Klump Street?"
"RORY: Tempting. Do you know that on a clear day you can see all the way to the garbage cans behind Al's Pancake World?"
"LORELAI: Hm. Or we could sit in the corner - you know, the Mafia table so that no one can come up behind you and whack you with a cannoli."
"RORY: Whack you with a cannoli? Oh, because he left the g*n and took the cannoli."
"LORELAI: You're so my daughter."
"LUKE: Aye aye aye."
"LORELAI: Hey, let's sit at the counter."
"RORY: Nah, the counter, those are not the power seats."
"LORELAI: Yes, but with no one here we can sit at either end and play bagel hockey."
"RORY: Ooh, bagel hockey! Oh boy!"
"LUKE: Just sit at a table."
"LORELAI: Oh, you're awfully rude for a guy who only has two paying customers."
"RORY: Okay, 3:30 on Friday - my debate at Chilton. Write it down."
"LORELAI: Already written."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: Are you prepared?"
"RORY: Please. Paris has us beyond prepared. I now know more about doctor assisted su1c1de then I ever cared to."
"LORELAI: Cheery topic"
"[phone rings]"
"LUKE: Luke's. Uh huh. Hold on a second. [to Rory] It's for you."
"RORY: What?"
"LUKE: Yup."
"RORY: But who knows we're here?"
"LORELAI: This whole morning has been a little Twilight Zone-y."
"LUKE: Or Outer Limits-y."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Great show, just as eerie, same era, but no one ever references it."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak geek."
"LUKE: Yup, stepped right in it."
"RORY: Hello?"
"LANE: Rory?"
"RORY: Lane. How did you know I was here?"
"LANE: Telescope. I got a clean sh*t at Luke's. I saw you and your mom go in."
"[Rory walks over to the window, stretching the phone cord across the diner]"
"LUKE: Hey, watch it."
"LORELAI: Yeah, duck Harvey."
"RORY: So I guess you're still grounded over that whole Henry thing, huh?"
"LANE: Are you kidding? It's the mother of all groundings. My mom's done everything but slap a Dr. Dre ankle bracelet on me. I'm not even going to school."
"RORY: Isn't it illegal to keep a kid out of school?"
"LANE: Well, she talked all my teachers into allowing me to be home-schooled for two weeks. I believe the words highly contagious' were batted about. I only get five minutes a day of outside phone time but unlimited time to call the Psalm a Day line. A big ripoff, by the way, because psalm 79 has been on there for three straight days. That's not in keeping with what their name clearly implies, which is a new psalm per day, every day. Not the same tired one from the previous two days."
"RORY: I've never heard anyone get so riled up about psalms before."
"LANE: My world has become very small. Okay, I'm dying for news. Give me some headlines."
"RORY: Oh, well, I've got a debate coming up. And, um, Dean's been working extra hours lately saving up for a new motorcycle, so I hardly see him. Mom and I haven't done laundry in three weeks, but I have taken to jumping into the gigantic pile of dirty clothes while we play our Reader's Digest World's Famous Polka CD that we got used for ninety-nine cents. Sorry if that's all boring."
"LANE: Are you kidding? It's the most stimulation I've got in a week."
"MRS. KIM: Lane, come down for your snack!"
"LANE: It's tea and melba toast time, gotta go. Don't forget me in my solitude."
"RORY: Never."
"LANE: Bye. [hangs up]"
"RORY: Think fast."
"[Rory tosses the phone to Luke, who catches it cleanly]"
"LORELAI: Whoa, impressive. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Goalie for the bagel hockey team?"
"RORY: And bump Schmitty?"
"LORELAI: Schmitty's over the hill, he's washed up, put him in Cooperstown. Suit up kid!"
"LUKE: Call me if anyone sane walks in."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the living room couch watching TV]"
"RORY: There's nothing on."
"LORELAI: There's always something on. Uh! Struck gold!"
"RORY: Not Two Fat Ladies again."
"LORELAI: Why not? They're brilliant."
"RORY: Because it's a cooking show and you don't cook."
"LORELAI: That might change."
"RORY: Not a chance."
"LORELAI: Probably not."
"RORY: Plus, we've seen all of them like five times. They're all repeats."
"LORELAI: Yeah, sadly because one of the fat ladies met her maker."
"RORY: Really? Which one?"
"LORELAI: The fat one."
"RORY: Come on, which one? The one on the motorcycle or the one in the sidecar?"
"LORELAI: See, it's fun just talking about the Two Fat Ladies."
"[doorbell rings]"
"RORY: Can't we find some other really fat people to watch?"
"LORELAI: Wow, that sounded really insensitive."
"[Rory answers the door]"
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Can I come in?"
"RORY: I guess. So?"
"PARIS: You couldn't possibly be wondering what I'm doing here."
"RORY: I couldn't?"
"PARIS: The debate's Friday and we need more preparation."
"RORY: More preparation? Paris -- no two people know more about assisted su1c1de than the two of us. Kevorkian called today for a couple of tips."
"PARIS: I know we know the material but there's issues of presentation that need to be addressed."
"RORY: Presentation?"
"PARIS: I was listening to the CD I b*rned of the cassettes I made of our mock debates against the make-believe team and I realized that you were not talking fast enough."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: You're only doing 135 wpm."
"RORY: Wpm?"
"PARIS: Words per minute."
"RORY: Of course."
"PARIS: That's slow."
"RORY: That's not slow."
"PARIS: It's Jimmy Bob slow."
"RORY: I talk normally."
"PARIS: For the average Willie Nelson roadie, yes, but not for a winning debate team member. As a comparison, I speak an average of 178 wpm."
"RORY: Okay, word speed isn't everything. Sometimes I will add a dramatic pause to prove a point, undercutting my wpm."
"PARIS: Let's not harbor any Pinteresque fantasies here, Rory. We'll have scant minutes to make our arguments and we have to maximize our collective wpm."
"RORY: Okay, okay. Let's just get going."
"LORELAI: Hey Paris. Were we expecting you?"
"PARIS: You should've been. I'm going to get set up. [walks to Rory's room]"
"RORY: We're going to my room to work on my wpm."
"LORELAI: Do I wanna know?"
"RORY: No."
"[Rory walks towards her room as the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: I'll get it! Hello?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lor, it's Chris."
"LORELAI: Hey you, how's it going?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Good, good. I'm on a little business trip here and I thought I'd call and check in on Rory."
"LORELAI: Oh, she went to some biker party a few days ago and never came back."
"CHRISTOPHER: Again?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, we gotta start disciplining that girl."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, who's got the time?"
"LORELAI: Actually, she's right here. I'll pass you to her. So where'd this business trip take you?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Your neck of the woods, actually. I'm in the Litchfield area."
"LORELAI: Really? How long?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I don't know, a couple of days, or for as long as it takes for them to succumb to my infinite charms."
"LORELAI: Well, if you're still here on Friday, you should come on down and see Rory in a debate at Chilton."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. It starts at 3:30 and it's first come, first serve. They're expecting like 20,000 people so I'd get there early."
"CHRISTOPHER: Wow, Chilton up close, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's your chance to see the famous Paris in action. There might even be casualties."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, tell Rory I'll be there."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Aw, she'll be excited. Here, tell her yourself."
"CHRISTOPHER: Pass me on."
"[Lorelai stands at the doorway to Rory's bedroom]"
"PARIS: Dairy's bad too because of the mucous. You haven't had any dairy in the last forty-eight hours, have you?"
"RORY: In my cereal this morning."
"PARIS: Geez! Okay, well there's a solution of salt water and vinegar that can help cut that."
"LORELAI: Girls, I'm sorry to interrupt vinegar hour, but it's your dad."
"RORY: [takes phone and walks away] Dad, hi."
"PARIS: Did you give her the cereal?"
"LORELAI: Um, I'd rather not say."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[In the center of town, Rory walks down the sidewalk as a pay phone rings. She answers it]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LANE: It's me."
"RORY: Lane, this is flat out stalking."
"LANE: Look, I don't have much time. I've already used up my five minutes of phone time so this is totally illicit, but I have to talk to you. There's a new Belle and Sebastian single coming out today."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: I have to have it."
"RORY: Okay, well -."
"LANE: No, I mean I have to have it."
"RORY: I don't know if I have time to pick it up."
"LANE: What? Rory, do you wanna hear how I used up my five minutes of phone time today? Talking to Amazon.com trying to get them to overnight it to me in a plain package with a return address referencing something Korean and religious."
"RORY: They wouldn't do it, huh?"
"LANE: I think they notified the government."
"RORY: Can't you just wait for your grounding to be over?"
"LANE: Hey, I am a fanatic audiophile. That comes with responsibilities that a grounding doesn't alter. Now, I have to have this single and you have to figure out how to get it to me."
"RORY: Okay, okay, I'll do my best."
"LANE: Thank you, I have to go. Oh, and hey."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: You've got something in your teeth."
"RORY: Stop that."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Before the debate starts, Lorelai and Sookie enter the auditorium looking for Rory]"
"LORELAI: Hey, there you are. Where were you?"
"RORY: Oh, hi."
"LORELAI: I thought we were gonna meet by the vending machines for a little, uh, pre-debate nondairy snack."
"RORY: Yeah, sorry, Paris wanted to do a sound check and she found some problems with the acoustics in the room."
"PARIS: It's the layout on this row of seats that's causing a bass problem. We've got to move this whole row over a foot. Esta! Just move these people out. Mueva esta gente, mueva, mueva!"
"RORY: Better find a seat before she moves them all."
"LORELAI: Have fun."
"RORY: Thanks. I'm glad you came."
"SOOKIE: No you're not!"
"RORY: What?"
"SOOKIE: I'm just getting you in the mood."
"[Rory walks away as Lorelai and Sookie sit down]"
"LORELAI: So do you see Christopher anywhere?"
"SOOKIE: [looks around] Uh, well, no, no, no. Hey, what does he look like?"
"LORELAI: If you don't know, why are you looking?"
"SOOKIE: I'm looking for a guy that looks like a guy that you could be with, only I'm deducting seventeen years off his age and I'm adding an all-boys private school uniform and a Yankees cap."
"LORELAI: And does your head hurt?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: If everybody could please take their seats, we'll begin. That includes all the members of the debate team."
"[Rory takes her seat on stage. She sees Brad sitting across from her]"
"RORY: Brad, hi."
"BRAD: Hi Rory. I didn't think you'd remember me."
"RORY: Oh, of course I do. How's the new school?"
"BRAD: I love it. It's way more mellow there and I made a ton of new friends."
"RORY: Good for you."
"PARIS: Well, Brad."
"BRAD: Paris."
"PARIS: Guess we're going mono a mono today, huh?"
"BRAD: Oh God."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: All right, the topic for today's debate is doctor-assisted su1c1de."
"SOOKIE: That's pleasant."
"MRS: O'MALLEY: Let me introduce the debaters. On the Hillside Academy team, we have Brad Lankford and Nancy Waterford."
"NANCY: You look sick."
"BRAD: I feel sick."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: And on the Chilton team, we have Rory Gilmore and Paris Gellar."
"[Sookie and Lorelai cheer loudly]"
"LORELAI: Oww!"
"SOOKIE: Whoo!"
"LORELAI: Oww!"
"[Everyone else is silent]"
"SOOKIE: Were we not supposed to do that?"
"LORELAI: Maybe no one noticed."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: Each team will have three minutes for their openings, three minutes for rebuttals, and two minutes for their conclusions. They will be judged on the basis of content, strategy, and style. I will be the judge, along with Mrs. Gladstone."
"PARIS: Mrs. O'Malley is impregnable but yesterday I complemented Mrs. Gladstone's dumpy outfit and bought her an ice cream sandwich and she practically licked my hand in gratitude."
"RORY: Nice going."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: We choose which team will take the pro or con side with the toss of a coin. A member of Hillside will make the call."
"BRAD: Heads. No, tails, I mean tails!"
"MRS. O'MALLEY: Uh, it's heads. Chilton will pick pro or con."
"PARIS: Pro assisted su1c1de."
"BRAD: What a shock."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: All right. Whenever you're ready, you may commence."
"PARIS: Thank you. [to Rory] Keep it snappy."
"[Rory walks to the podium]"
"RORY: There are many vantage points from which to consider doctor assisted su1c1de. Serious consideration draws from ethics, law, medical practices, philosophy, psychology, public policy and religion, all topics I plan to explore in the next two minutes and forty-six seconds."
"LORELAI: Geez, look at that kid, he's shaking."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, and pale."
"LORELAI: He looks all white and tiny."
"RORY: ... provides either information or the actual means, such as medication or other supplies to a person who wishes to terminate his or her own life. The patient must then initiate the process. The goal is euthanasia, a term with its roots in ancient Greek. . ."
"[As Rory speaks in the background, Lorelai turns around and sees Christopher in the hallway. A few seconds later, Sherry joins him.]"
"CUT TO LATER IN THE DEBATE"
"PARIS: And referencing their last point, which erroneously cited South Carolina as a state that has neither a statute nor common law which prohibits assisted su1c1de when we know that North Carolina is the proper citation, their subsequent argument falls short of even a level of speciousness due to the fact that it doesn't even have a ring of factual truth, let alone a substance. And after all, the absence of prohibition against assisted su1c1de is a far cry from a statute that actually legitimizes the practice, a state of affairs that exists only in Oregon, sadly enough, under the 1977 Death Without Dignity Act."
"[While Paris is speaking, Sookie tries to subtly look at Sherry, who's sitting towards the back of the audience]"
"LORELAI: Hey, circus lady, what's with the contortions?"
"SOOKIE: I'm trying to sneak a peak at the girl Christopher's with."
"LORELAI: But you see, the entire concept behind the word sneak is not having people notice you, and what you're doing is shouting notice me.'"
"SOOKIE: Tell me you're not curious."
"LORELAI: I'm not curious."
"SOOKIE: You are too."
"LORELAI: We'll meet her in a matter of minutes. Now, come on, watch the tiny shaking boy get shorter."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: Two minutes for conclusion."
"[Lorelai purposely drops her tissue.]"
"LORELAI: Ooh. [She leans over to pick it up while glancing back at Sherry]"
"SOOKIE: You sneak a little peak?"
"LORELAI: Shh."
"PARIS: Professor Bomar of Willamette University of Law has prepared a lengthy summary that I'd like to use in my remaining time."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: Time."
"PARIS: What?"
"MRS. O'MALLEY: That's it, time's up."
"PARIS: Oh, but if I could just have a few seconds to rebut their charge of the cruelty of the act."
"BRAD: We take it back!"
"PARIS: You can't take it back, it's a debate."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: Okay, that's enough cruelty for one day, Paris. Your team has won. Congratulations."
"PARIS: Really? Thank you. Thank you very much. [walks over to opposing team] You put up a good fight. Better luck next time."
"RORY: You okay?"
"BRAD: I'm sweating. I'm completely soaked through. And I think I'm catching a cold."
"RORY: Do you need a hug? Or a towel?"
"BRAD: No, thanks. I think I'm just gonna sit here quietly."
"[cut to Lorelai and Sookie standing near the doorway]"
"SOOKIE: Uh! There they are."
"LORELAI: I see them. What do you think?"
"SOOKIE: She's got good hair."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: Plus she's been sitting for an hour and her dress is perfect. Not a wrinkle? How does she do that?"
"LORELAI: She must be a witch."
"SOOKIE: And she's doing that no-hose thing."
"LORELAI: Yeah. She's a chic, good hair, wrinkle-free, no-hose-wearing witch."
"SOOKIE: You ready?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"[they walk towards Christopher and Sherry]"
"LORELAI: Hi there, you two."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lorelai. You guys get to meet at last. This is. . ."
"LORELAI: Sherry."
"SHERRY: Nice to finally meet you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I recognized you from your Christmas card."
"CHRISTOPHER: Which I'm sure you mocked mercilessly."
"LORELAI: Did not. Others, yes, but not yours. You guys were cute, and the puppy was cute. [Sookie clears her throat] Hey, this is Sookie."
"SHERRY: Nice to meet you."
"SOOKIE: Nice to meet you. You have a very smooth dress."
"SHERRY: Oh, well thank you. It's the fabric."
"SOOKIE: The fabric. Uh huh."
"LORELAI: Hm. Uh, Chris, I've told you about Sookie."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes you have, the famous Sookie."
"SOOKIE: The famous Christopher."
"CHRISTOPHER: I hear you're the greatest chef after Alan Ducass."
"SOOKIE: After Alan Ducass? Who  who said after?"
"RORY: Hi Dad! You came."
"CHRISTOPHER: Of course I did."
"RORY: Sorry, I'm still getting used to it. I'm glad."
"LORELAI: Honey, um, look who Dad brought."
"CHRISTOPHER: This is Sherry. Sherry, this is Rory."
"SHERRY: Oh, finally, finally, finally. I am so beyond thrilled, I can't tell you. All he does is talk about you. I couldn't wait to meet this amazing person."
"LORELAI: Well, she lives up to the hype, let me tell ya."
"RORY: Is my face turning red?"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, beet red."
"SHERRY: Oh, I'm sorry. I put you on the spot. I've just been really looking forward to this."
"RORY: No, no, it's okay."
"LORELAI: Um, will you excuse us for a minute? Rory just wanted to show me something around the corner here and we'll be right back."
"CHRISTOPHER: So Rory was great, huh?"
"SOOKIE: Brilliant. So, who said I was after Alan Ducass?"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the hall and into the auditorium]"
"RORY: He brought Sherry."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: This is a little. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Did you talk to her? Is she nice?"
"LORELAI: She's a witch."
"RORY: Oh, good."
"LORELAI: So, what do we do?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: Come on, come on, come on. We gotta put on our hostessing hats and set a game plan here."
"RORY: Oh yeah, I guess it would be impolite if we didn't ask them to hang out with us."
"LORELAI: So what do we do? Hit the vending machines?"
"RORY: Invite them to Luke's?"
"LORELAI: Does she look like a diner chick to you?"
"RORY: Probably not."
"LORELAI: I wish he had told me she was with him."
"RORY: Where else can we invite them?"
"LORELAI: Al's Pancake World."
"RORY: No, it's Friday. He does his prefix menu on Fridays."
"LORELAI: Ugh. Well, there's always our house."
"RORY: It's a mess."
"LORELAI: Might be the safest?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Why didn't he mention that she was with him?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"[they walk back towards them]"
"CHRISTOPHER: It's really just more of an impression than something I probably actually heard."
"SOOKIE: But maybe someone implied that I was after him?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: You know what, you are the greatest chef in the world, bar none."
"SOOKIE: Uh, thanks."
"LORELAI: So, um, are you guys doing anything now?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Not really."
"SHERRY: No, we're pretty free for the rest of the day."
"LORELAI: Well, why don't you come back and see our place?"
"SHERRY: Oh, that would be great."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, Sherry would love that. Thanks Lor."
"SHERRY: I was hoping we'd get a chance to see where Rory lives and her room."
"RORY: Oh, my room's really no big deal."
"SHERRY: Oh, and the books. I've heard all about the books. I can't wait to see the books."
"LORELAI: Well, let's go and see the books."
"[They start walking down the hall as Paris walks over]"
"PARIS: Rory! So, great job. We pretty much wiped the floor with them."
"RORY: Yeah, we turned them into cleaning products, definitely."
"PARIS: Listen, the verbatim transcripts of the debate will be ready in about a half hour. I thought we could wait for them and sit and talk about what we did right, what we did wrong, compare wpm's."
"RORY: Well, I'm actually heading with my group back to our house, so I really can't."
"PARIS: Oh. Okay, whatever. If you don't want to celebrate with me, that's just fine."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory rush through the front door]"
"LORELAI: You get the living room, I'll get the kitchen!"
"RORY: What about the upstairs?"
"LORELAI: I'll body block the fool who tries to go upstairs."
"RORY: Company is stressful."
"LORELAI: Ugh, don't forget about your room!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Your room! She wants to see the books!"
"RORY: Well, I'll hit it next."
"LORELAI: Ugh, they're probably gonna want something to eat and drink."
"RORY: Well, company usually does."
"LORELAI: We have nothing."
"RORY: We must have something."
"LORELAI: Not unless Divine Providence has placed a miracle brie and cracker plate in the fridge."
"RORY: We have leftover Halloween candy."
"LORELAI: Aw, waste that on company?"
"RORY: Well, having company is about making sacrifices."
"LORELAI: Martha Stewart?"
"RORY: I paraphrased Proust."
"LORELAI: I should've known. Fine. Presentation is everything."
"CHRISTOPHER: [calls from front door] Hello?"
"RORY: Hi Dad!"
"CHRISTOPHER: You guys need some more time to clean up?"
"LORELAI: He knows us too well."
"RORY: Come on in. How'd you know we were cleaning?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, well, when you cut us off in the parking lot and sped off doing sixty, I figured you were trying to b*at us home for a reason."
"SHERRY: I hope we're not completely ruining your day."
"LORELAI: Oh no, we love company. Please come in."
"SHERRY: Your house is great."
"LORELAI: Thanks, we like it. Have a seat."
"[they all sit down in the living room]"
"SHERRY: Rory, you were wonderful in the debate today."
"RORY: Thanks."
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, that Paris was a little intense."
"LORELAI: Ha, a little? The opposing team could bring her up on w*r crimes."
"RORY: Yeah, her approach will come in handy when she becomes a CEO or a dictator of a country or something."
"SHERRY: Mm hmm. Well, you were very poised up there, very sure of yourself, just like your dad."
"CHRISTOPHER: And your mom."
"LORELAI: Aw shucks, Pa."
"SHERRY: And your uniform is darling, really. I love the blue. Of course, I'm sure you look good in anything."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, you should see her in chaps."
"SHERRY: Really?"
"RORY: No, that was just my mom being funny."
"SHERRY: Oh."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it comes and goes. You'll learn to notice the signs."
"CHRISTOPHER: The waves get really still, the animals start to act funny."
"SHERRY: You know, I went to private school too."
"RORY: Really?"
"SHERRY: Except that our colors were white and bright red. I looked hideous."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, she's being self-deprecating. You looked cute in that outfit."
"SHERRY: No no, I looked like a peppermint stick. I swear, that's where my addiction to clothes comes from. Trying to make up for all the years of having to wear the same thing everyday."
"RORY: Yeah, I can understand that."
"SHERRY: Well, we should go shopping sometime for clothes or whatever."
"RORY: Yeah, we could do that."
"SHERRY: Soon, okay?"
"RORY: Sure."
"LORELAI: Hey, drinks. Who wants something to drink? I've got water, soda. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, just water for me"
"SHERRY: Me too."
"LORELAI: Oh, making it easy, I love it."
"SHERRY: I'll help you."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, uh, well, okay. Sherry, you don't have to help me."
"SHERRY: No, I want to."
"LORELAI: Great."
"[Lorelai and Sherry walk into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: So, uh, do you want flat water or sparkling? I hope it's flat because I don't have sparkling. Or flat. Or ice cubes. I have cups, I think."
"SHERRY: It's a little awkward, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"SHERRY: Us, you and me, our being here."
"LORELAI: Aw, no, not really."
"SHERRY: But kind of, right?"
"LORELAI: Well, we're just not used to having company."
"SHERRY: I mean, you and Christopher were so close. I know it was years ago but these things are never simple."
"LORELAI: Well, just in general, things like this are always awkward slightly, but only slightly. [opens fridge] Agh, look. Apple juice - with a perfectly respectable expiration date."
"SHERRY: Look, I just want you to know that you should not feel like you need to get to know me."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"SHERRY: At all."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"SHERRY: I mean, just because Christopher and I are close doesn't mean that we need to be close, or friends or anything for that matter."
"LORELAI: No, I guess not."
"SHERRY: I mean, except for our unexpected visit, we may never have even met."
"LORELAI: I think we probably would've met eventually."
"SHERRY: Perhaps, at some function or other."
"LORELAI: Yeah - you, me, Martin Sheen all chained to the same tree."
"SHERRY: But I do desperately wanna get to know Rory."
"LORELAI: Well sure, she's a great kid."
"SHERRY: And that's okay with you?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, that's fine."
"SHERRY: Oh, I'm so glad to hear that. Because things are kind of speeding up between me and Christopher and "
"LORELAI: Really?"
"SHERRY: Rory is so important to him."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, she is."
"SHERRY: And he told me about how he wasn't really a presence in her life for years and how he'd like to make up for all that time that he wasted."
"LORELAI: Well, he's been doing really well lately."
"SHERRY: I know. He is obsessive about his call dates to her. I mean, it doesn't matter where we are or what we're doing, he's gotta call Rory Wednesday nights at seven o'clock. I like that about him."
"LORELAI: Yeah, me too."
"SHERRY: And he really wants me to bond with her too. It's important with everything we have coming."
"LORELAI: I totally understand."
"SHERRY: Good, I'm glad."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SHERRY: So what are the chances of Rory and I getting together on this trip?"
"LORELAI: This trip?"
"SHERRY: How about tonight?"
"LORELAI: Tonight?"
"SHERRY: Rory seemed up for it."
"LORELAI: Tonight huh? Well, uh, it's kind of last minute and we're supposed to go somewhere."
"SHERRY: The Friday night dinner with your parents."
"LORELAI: You know about those?"
"SHERRY: All about them, but Christopher said that you can get her out of them if there's a pressing need."
"LORELAI: Well, that's true to a certain extent but - ."
"SHERRY: Well this is pressing. I am so forcing myself here it's embarrassing, but that's how important it is. I mean, who knows when this opportunity's gonna present itself again, right?"
"LORELAI: Right."
"SHERRY: So?"
"LORELAI: Well, um, sure. You'll have to ask Rory but if it's okay with her, it's okay with me."
"SHERRY: You know, you're as great as Christopher said you were."
"LORELAI: Well, he's an excellent judge of character."
"SHERRY: Okay, I'll see you back out there? Okay."
"[Sherry brings two of the glasses into the living room]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Everything okay?"
"SHERRY: Yup, she found apple juice."
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [from kitchen] Hey Rory, can you get that!"
"RORY: Let the machine pick it up."
"LORELAI: No, it could be important."
"RORY: Okay. [answers phone] Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hi, it's me."
"RORY: Oh, hi."
"LORELAI: I'm still in the kitchen. Um, listen, I just wanted to tell you that Sherry just asked me if she could go out with you tonight just the two of you, and she sort of trapped me into saying that I could get you out of the Friday night dinner, which she knew all about. But I told her she had to run it past you first, so I can still get you out of it. Although, it might be a good idea to get a Sherry night out of the way because it seems kind of inevitable. So if you're okay going with her, just say, um, Sorry Leonard, we've got company, I have to call you back.'"
"RORY: Sorry Leonard, we've got company, I'll have to call you back."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay. Bye. [walks into the living room] Okay, here's your drink. Who was that?"
"RORY: Um, that was Leonard."
"LORELAI: Oh, did you tell him we have company?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, who's Leonard?"
"RORY: Oh, just a friend."
"CHRISTOPHER: A friend of yours or a friend of Lorelai's?"
"LORELAI: A mutual friend."
"RORY: Yeah, it's pretty much equal."
"CHRISTOPHER: A mutual Leonard?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, we're constantly fighting over him."
"SHERRY: Rory, can I run something by you?"
"RORY: Oh sure."
"SHERRY: Your dad and I are around for another night, and he's totally sick of me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Not true."
"SHERRY: Anyhow, I was wondering if you wanted to do something with me tonight, just the two of us."
"RORY: Oh, sure, that would be nice."
"SHERRY: Really?"
"RORY: Yeah. I mean, um, if it's okay with my mom because we do have a Grandma/Grandpa dinner tonight."
"LORELAI: It's fine by me."
"SHERRY: Great. Oh, of course this does leave you a sad little orphan."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, that's okay. I'll have one of my patented White Castle bachelor dinners."
"LORELAI: Or you can come with me tonight. Uh, if you want."
"CHRISTOPHER: To your parents?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, cause with Rory not there I might need a hostage."
"SHERRY: Oh, yes, do it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, it's good grub. You sure they won't be mad?"
"LORELAI: Hi, they like you."
"CHRISTOPHER: True."
"SHERRY: Great. Well, we should go get cleaned up for tonight then. Thanks for having us over like this."
"LORELAI: Any time."
"SHERRY: So we'll swing by around six?"
"RORY: Oh, sounds good."
"SHERRY: Okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: Bye sweetie."
"RORY: Bye Dad."
"CHRISTOPHER: Bye Leonard."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Later that night, Rory is in the living room as Lorelai walks down the stairs]"
"LORELAI: Honey, hurry, they said six."
"RORY: Yeah but it's six Dad time so it's more like six-thirty."
"LORELAI: But Dad time is now linked to Sherry time and that Sherry seems awfully punctual."
"RORY: That is so annoying."
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: We have to learn to live with each other's deficiencies."
"RORY: I'll get it."
"LORELAI: Oh, if it's Leonard, tell him I'll call him back."
"RORY: He's so needy. [answers phone] Hello?"
"LANE: Humongous snag in the CD drop plan."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LANE: Bible class has been moved an hour later, all to accommodate the reverend's handball schedule."
"RORY: The reverend plays handball?"
"LANE: I'm just as appalled. So it's at ten instead of nine."
"RORY: Okay, I'll make the necessary adjustments."
"LANE: Thank you, thank you, thank you. So, anything new?"
"RORY: My dad brought his girlfriend to my debate."
"LANE: The potential stepmom? Oh my God. Tell me what she's like, what'd she say and tell me in like eleven seconds cause it's all the phone time I have left."
"RORY: That's too much pressure!"
"LANE: Well, then write a long descriptive letter about it all and slip it into the CD booklet. Oh, and try to include a candid Polaroid of her if you can."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LANE: Gotta go."
"RORY: Bye. [hangs up]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, can we come in?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, come on in. Hey."
"SHERRY: You look great."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks, you too."
"SHERRY: Hi there, you ready to go?"
"RORY: All set."
"SHERRY: Okay, so we won't be too late, probably around ten."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, if you wanna grab a drink after the movie, Rory's got the list of places that serve minors."
"RORY: Nah, I got a flask in my purse."
"LORELAI: Ooh."
"SHERRY: Okay, I'm gonna have to drink a lot of coffee to keep up with you two."
"LORELAI: Damn, our secret's been revealed."
"SHERRY: Bye love."
"CHRISTOPHER: Have fun"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Bye Sweets."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Rory and Sherry leave]"
"CHRISTOPHER: There they go."
"LORELAI: Yeah, there they go."
"CHRISTOPHER: Sherry's really excited about this. It's such a great opportunity Lor. Thanks for making it happen."
"LORELAI: That's what I'm here for. Let me just get my coat and we can go."
"CHRISTOPHER: Great."
"LORELAI: Can I just ask you a quick question?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sure, what?"
"LORELAI: When I invited you to Rory's debate, was Sherry with you?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, of course. She's been with me the whole trip. Why?"
"LORELAI: It's just that you gave me no indication that she was with you."
"CHRISTOPHER: What? I must have."
"LORELAI: Nope, singular pronouns all the way."
"CHRISTOPHER: I actually don't remember what I said."
"LORELAI: I do. You said, I'll be there', as in just you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I may have said that but I wasn't making a point of saying that. It just came out that way."
"LORELAI: Okay, whatever, I was just wondering."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay that I brought Sherry along, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely. It was just a surprise, that's all."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay."
"LORELAI: So you weren't trying to hide the fact?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No. I mean, obviously you were gonna find out she was with me once we arrived."
"LORELAI: Obviously."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay then."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: So what do you think of her?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know her well enough to judge."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, that's never stopped you from judging people before."
"LORELAI: Hey buddy, I'm trying to grow here."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, if it helps, she was saying really nice things about you."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. She said you guys had a really nice talk in the kitchen."
"LORELAI: Well, if that's what she said, then I guess we did."
"CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai, come on."
"LORELAI: What?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You're being very cryptic. Did something happen between you two?"
"LORELAI: No, I just. . .I thought our conversation in the kitchen was a little odd."
"CHRISTOPHER: And this is being less cryptic?"
"LORELAI: It's just that she went on and on about how we never have to be friends or get to know each other at all or try to force any kind of relationship."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really? She never mentioned that part. Huh."
"LORELAI: So how come she figures she never has to see me?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm sure she was trying to make you feel at ease around her. Because it's true, you guys don't have to force anything."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. Where'd she get this don't force it' philosophy?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Not from me."
"LORELAI: You sure?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, I'm sure."
"LORELAI: So she just wants to get to know Rory, not me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I did steer her toward bonding with Rory, I'll admit that."
"LORELAI: But not with me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Rory's my daughter Lorelai, Sherry has to get to know her."
"LORELAI: I know."
"CHRISTOPHER: I wasn't purposely omitting you or telling her not to interact with you."
"LORELAI: Oh good, so you're not having me k*ll or anything like that?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No. In fact, I was just going over my people to k*ll' list and I don't think you were on it."
"LORELAI: Because by the very fact that Rory exists, I am in the picture."
"CHRISTOPHER: You can back off Lorelai. You'll be in Sherry's life."
"LORELAI: Good."
"CHRISTOPHER: Not that you thought to do the same thing when you were in my shoes."
"LORELAI: What? What are you talking about?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You have a fiancé, I believe."
"LORELAI: Yes, Max."
"CHRISTOPHER: Right, Max."
"LORELAI: That was not the same thing."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really? Max knew Rory, Max got close to Rory, right?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, he and I never met. I didn't even know he existed until late in the game. Hell, I didn't even know you were engaged until you called me from your bachelorette party. And I wasn't invited to the wedding  or did my invitation get lost in the mail?"
"LORELAI: Well, you've moved a lot this past year."
"CHRISTOPHER: I was never part of that equation."
"LORELAI: Okay, maybe. But trust me, you would've been part of the equation eventually. Really Chris, you would have."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well then, trust me Lorelai, eventually you would've been part of this one."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Doorbell rings, Emily answers it.]"
"EMILY: Christopher!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hello Emily."
"EMILY: Well, this is a surprise. Where's Rory?"
"LORELAI: Uh, a last minute unexpected thing came up, but I brought a good substitute  half her genes in a nice nifty Christopher package."
"EMILY: Well, we're letting the freezing air get in. Come in, come in. Is she sick? There are terrible things making the rounds these days."
"[they walk to the living room]"
"LORELAI: No, she's not sick. Hi Dad."
"RICHARD: Hello Lorelai. Christopher, this is a surprise!"
"CHRISTOPHER: A nice one, I hope."
"RICHARD: A very nice one."
"CHRISTOPHER: How are you Richard?"
"RICHARD: You're looking well."
"CHRISTOPHER: So are you. You playing a lot of golf lately?"
"RICHARD: Ah, well, more like it's playing me. Oh, let's not stand here. Come into the living room. Now, who wants a drink? Uh, martini, Manhattan, some scotch?"
"LORELAI: Yes please."
"RICHARD: Uh, you wanna narrow that down for me?"
"LORELAI: Hooch is hooch Dad."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'll have a Manhattan."
"EMILY: Same here."
"RICHARD: Right."
"EMILY: So you never said where Rory is."
"RICHARD: Rory's not here?"
"EMILY: Richard, you didn't even notice your own granddaughter isn't here?"
"RICHARD: Well, she's so quiet she sometimes slips in unnoticed. She should work for the CIA. Uh, one cherry good for everybody?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Fine with me."
"EMILY: Me too."
"LORELAI: Eight please. I'm peckish."
"EMILY: Well, I noticed that Rory isn't here."
"LORELAI: Well you've got that eagle eye, Mom."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm afraid it's my fault Emily. My girlfriend and I were passing through town and we dropped by Stars Hollow for a visit, and she and Rory are off doing something together."
"EMILY: You have a girlfriend?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sherry."
"EMILY: And she and Rory are out together?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. I should've called, Mom."
"EMILY: Well, that would've been thoughtful. I mean, we set a place for her at the table and everything."
"LORELAI: Well, Chris is here so it won't go to waste."
"CHRISTOPHER: Although normally I demand my own customized place setting."
"EMILY: So how long have you been with this woman?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Eight months."
"RICHARD: Mm, I bet she's pretty."
"LORELAI: Yes, she's very pretty."
"RICHARD: Uh, something in your eye Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: I got it."
"EMILY: You've met this woman?"
"LORELAI: Yes, Mom, I met this woman today and she's very nice."
"RICHARD: Uh, what does she do? Does she work?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, she's the East Coast sales rep for Loreal Cosmetics."
"RICHARD: Hm, that sounds like a lot of responsibility."
"CHRISTOPHER: Keeps her busy, involves some travel."
"EMILY: What are they doing?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Rory and Christopher's friend  what are they doing tonight?"
"LORELAI: Dinner and a movie, something like that. It's my fault that we didn't call."
"RICHARD: You work has you traveling too, I hear."
"CHRISTOPHER: Some."
"RICHARD: Everyone thinks that traveling on business is so glamorous but what they don't realize is that the business traveler never gets to see the places he visits. My last trip to Rome, I spent the whole four days in a conference room by the airport. I might as well have been in French Lick, Indiana."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, my trips are mostly local, just me and my Volvo."
"EMILY: You have a Volvo?"
"RICHARD: That's new, isn't it?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I just got it."
"RICHARD: Excellent choice. It's nice and safe. That's a good family car."
"LORELAI: It's also excellent for cranking Metallica."
"RICHARD: Cranking Metallica?"
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"RICHARD: If that's some sort of drug reference, it isn't funny."
"EMILY: So you're planning on having a family?"
"CHRISTOPHER: What?"
"EMILY: With this woman?"
"LORELAI: Her name's Sherry, Mom, and you're really putting Chris on the spot here."
"EMILY: Well, he bought a family car, it's a natural question."
"LORELAI: Dad called it a family car. I'm sure there's nothing in the sales contract that says you have to have a family in order to buy the car."
"CHRISTOPHER: Although I didn't read all the fine print."
"EMILY: You always drove a motorcycle before, didn't you?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I still got it."
"RICHARD: Oh, oh, a family man shouldn't drive a motorcycle. The accidents I covered for the firm involving motorcycles  the worst, grisly. They use this industrial machine to scrape the victims off the road like a huge spatula."
"LORELAI: Hey, mouthful of cherries here."
"EMILY: So are you living together?"
"LORELAI: Mom, get out the interrogation lamp, why don't you."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay. Yeah, but we're looking for something bigger in the Boston area."
"RICHARD: There are a lot of nice historical places up there."
"CHRISTOPHER: Something historical in our price range would be perfect."
"EMILY: You know historical homes are infested with mold, don't you?"
"LORELAI: Mold?"
"EMILY: It gets inside the walls and grows out of sight and sh**t off spores that slowly k*ll you and your family."
"LORELAI: You should get a show on the Home and Garden channel, Mom."
"RICHARD: When did you become an expert on mold, Emily?"
"EMILY: It was in the New York Times Magazine. I'd hold off buying a place with this woman until you look into this."
"LORELAI: Sherry, Sherry."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, it's actually gonna come down to whatever we can afford. It might just be a newly built place."
"EMILY: With their shoddy craftsmanship? Oh, you don't want that."
"LORELAI: What does that leave them with, Mom  a teepee?"
"EMILY: I'm sorry. I just don't think that Rory should miss our dinners for something other than sickness or emergencies. That was the agreement."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry Emily, really."
"LORELAI: Mom, Chris has apologized like a hundred times. How many more times do you wanna hear it?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Listen, I can call Sherry and have her and Rory come by after their movie, that way it won't be a totally Rory-less evening."
"EMILY: That's not what I want."
"LORELAI: Mom, we're desperately trying to work with you here."
"EMILY: Working with me is one thing, patronizing me is another. Excuse me. [leaves]"
"CHRISTOPHER: I feel horrible."
"RICHARD: Oh, don't son. That's just Emily."
"LORELAI: I'll go see what I can do."
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks in as Emily pours herself a drink]"
"LORELAI: You wanna tell me what's going on here?"
"EMILY: How can you let that horrible woman take Rory like that?"
"LORELAI: Okay Mom, calm down. It's only one night."
"EMILY: That's how it starts. She's just getting her claws into her."
"LORELAI: Her claws?"
"EMILY: We'll never see Rory again if that woman has her way."
"LORELAI: Mom, hold it. Rory is my daughter, you know. I have some control over this."
"EMILY: She's not getting Rory on weekends, you can't let that happen."
"LORELAI: What is this about Mom? Why are you so flipped out?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, are you blind or just that humiliated?"
"LORELAI: Humiliated?"
"EMILY: Christopher gets his life together with that woman."
"LORELAI: So, that's good."
"EMILY: It should've been you!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Don't play dumb, Lorelai. You know it too, and deep down I know you're heartbroken."
"LORELAI: I'm not heartbroken."
"EMILY: Well, I am."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"EMILY: I always had the picture in my mind of the three of you together. After all these years and after all the bad things that happened, Rory with both her parents. And now that Christopher's got his life together, it's with her and not you."
"LORELAI: Mom, the timing was never right for us."
"EMILY: That's because you dawdled time away. You could've had that affect on him. You could've been the person to help him get his life together, but you made no effort!"
"LORELAI: Oh, so now this comes down to something I didn't do? Don't put that on me Mother!"
"EMILY: What other explanation is there? He's always been crazy about you but you've always kept him at arms length. You keep everyone at arm's length."
"LORELAI: That's not true!"
"EMILY: It is true! Your destiny was to be with Christopher and now it's too late!"
"LORELAI: Then it wasn't our destiny!"
"EMILY: So you're saying that you don't have feelings for him Lorelai, that all of this is just fine with you?"
"LORELAI: That's not important."
"EMILY: It's not?"
"LORELAI: No. What's important is that Christopher is doing well and he's happy and we should be happy for him."
"EMILY: You're impossible. I need to lie down. Tell Christopher  tell him whatever you like, I don't care."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks through the door]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: You alone this morning?"
"LORELAI: No, Rory's with me. She just had to run an errand."
"LUKE: Well, take whatever table you want."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: You don't seem your chipper self."
"LORELAI: I brought some sparklers. I'll light them later and do some kicks."
"LUKE: You know, if you want I can clear the counter and you can play some bagel hockey."
"LORELAI: You can't play bagel hockey by yourself."
"LUKE: I'll play with you. You'll have to explain the rules."
"LORELAI: It's okay. I'm just trying to recover from last night. It was one of those nights where you start off stepping in quicksand and end up with a sixteen-ton anvil landing on your head."
"LUKE: I've had plenty of those. I'll bring some coffee."
"LORELAI: Can't hurt."
"[Lorelai walks towards an empty table as Rory walks in]"
"RORY: You order?"
"LORELAI: Oh, just coffee. God, I must've been sound asleep when you got home last night."
"RORY: You were snoring like a buzz saw."
"LORELAI: I believe that's defined as a superfluous comment."
"RORY: Yes, you were sound asleep."
"LORELAI: So, I'm dying to hear about your night with Sherry. How was it? Give it to me, A to Z, beginning to end, soup to nuts."
"RORY: Well, she is what she seems."
"LORELAI: Details please."
"RORY: She's a very cautious driver. She doesn't roll through stop signs, doesn't speed, she always signals before she turns."
"LORELAI: Hm. Commendable, but not the person I want driving our getaway car."
"RORY: What are we robbing?"
"LORELAI: Sephora. We had it all planned out."
"RORY: Slipped my mind."
"LORELAI: What's her music taste?"
"RORY: Big Bruce Springsteen fan. Seen him like twenty times."
"LORELAI: Blue collar roots or is she just slumming?"
"RORY: Oh, her father owned a shoe store and her mom taught kindergarten."
"LORELAI: Wow, you guys really got into some details."
"RORY: She was definitely in bonding mode."
"LORELAI: What else, what else?"
"RORY: She's very touchy-feely. Hand on the shoulder, lots of hugs."
"LORELAI: She didn't try to get fresh, did she?"
"RORY: Gross!"
"LORELAI: Go on."
"RORY: Um, she's had one prior serious relationship in her life."
"LORELAI: Finally, the juicy stuff."
"RORY: And it lasted eleven years."
"LORELAI: Eleven years? And she never got married?"
"RORY: She said she never thought about it with her career and all, but now she's thinking about it more and more."
"LORELAI: Tick tock, tick tock."
"RORY: And the past couple of years she hasn't even dated anyone unless she thought that for sure it could be a lasting relationship, and she's got some specific goals now concerning children."
"LORELAI: Oh, here we go."
"RORY: She wants at least two, and before she met Dad she was seriously considering single parenthood."
"LORELAI: That's wanting kids."
"RORY: That's about it."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"RORY: Oh, she works for Loreal."
"LORELAI: Hm, I heard that."
"RORY: I'm tapped. How was your night?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, fine. Just took Mom a whole five minutes before she self-combusted and left the room in tears."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: She freaked out that you were with Sherry, can you believe that?"
"RORY: She freaked?"
"LORELAI: Totally. She kept calling her that woman'."
"RORY: Well, what did she think, that you were gonna come home and find a rabbit boiling on the stove?"
"LORELAI: No, it had to do with her and Christopher and . . . anyway, eventually she came down and had a pouty dinner."
"RORY: So it ended up okay?"
"LORELAI: For the most part."
"RORY: Is she mad at me?"
"LORELAI: No, the angel child, never."
"LUKE: Here you go. [brings their coffee]"
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Thanks. So, um, I wanna ask you something."
"RORY: Ask."
"LORELAI: When you've thought about me and your dad  what have you been thinking all these years?"
"RORY: Um, what do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I mean, did you ever picture us potentially together, like we are family' together?"
"RORY: Well, not really."
"LORELAI: But sort of, it crossed your mind?"
"RORY: I feel like I'm on the Ricki Lake show."
"LORELAI: Go Rory, go Rory."
"RORY: Well, I'll admit that I have pictured the three of us living together at various times, but in the way that all kids picture their estranged parents living together or the way they should be together, but it's stupid."
"LORELAI: It's not stupid."
"RORY: Yeah, I've pictured it."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"RORY: But I also pictured you with Pee-Wee Herman."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"RORY: Yeah. We lived in his playhouse and we'd be talking to Chairy and Captain Carl would be walking by."
"LORELAI: [laughs] Fun!"
"RORY: Yeah. Oh, and later I pictured you marrying Matthew Broderick, and we lived in New York in this great apartment in the village and we would talk about his Ferris Bueller days."
"LORELAI: Just think how easy Producers tickets would be to get."
"RORY: Oh, it would be fourth row center every night."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry that Matthew and I couldn't work it out, honey."
"RORY: I'll try to get over it."
"LORELAI: So should it have been me?"
"RORY: Huh? Oops, sorry! Zero hour  I have to go. I'll be right back. [leaves]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory stands by the gazebo and waits for Mrs. Kim and Lane to walk out of their house. When they do, Rory nods to Kirk, who walks up to them.]"
"KIRK: Excuse me Mrs. Kim, I'm Kirk."
"MRS. KIM: I know you're Kirk. I've known you since you were two."
"KIRK: That's no guarantee that people remember me."
"MRS. KIM: We're in a hurry."
"KIRK: I won't take up much of your time. I was just wondering what your store hours are."
"MRS. KIM: For people who come to buy things, come with cash, it's ten to six, Sunday through Friday. For people who wander around, blocking aisles, touching things with dirty hands, never buying or asking for eighty percent off, we're closed."
"KIRK: I should jot this down. You said ten to six, that's ten a.m.?"
"MRS. KIM: Yes."
"KIRK: Okay, got it, thanks for your time."
"[While they're talking, a hooded jogger runs by and slips a CD into the bag Lane's carrying. Mrs. Kim and Lane walk away. The jogger, Michel, runs over to Rory at the gazebo, out of breath.]"
"RORY: Oh my God. Michel, are you okay?"
"MICHEL: I've been running around this stupid square for over an hour."
"RORY: Why?"
"MICHEL: Why? Because the plan was to drop the CD at nine o'clock."
"RORY: No, it got changed to ten. I told my mom and she said she'd pass it on. She didn't pass it on, did she?"
"MICHEL: Definitely not."
"RORY: Oh, well the mission was a success."
"MICHEL: Yes, my cardiologist will be thrilled. Ah! I've got a cramp, I've got a cramp!"
"RORY: Can I do anything for you?"
"MICHEL: Ah, get away from me evil girl!"
"RORY: But -."
"MICHEL: Never will I do anything for you again, ever, ever, never!"
"RORY: Well if it makes you feel any better, you had really good form."
"MICHEL: You are your mother's child."
"RORY: Thank you!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai sits at her table as Christopher and Sherry walk in]"
"LORELAI: Hey you guys."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey."
"SHERRY: We just wanted to say a last goodbye. Rory's not here?"
"LORELAI: She went outside somewhere. You can probably find her."
"SHERRY: Oh, okay. I think I will. We had such a great time last night. So I hear your dinner was good?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah, it was great."
"SHERRY: I would love to see that house sometime, especially the portrait of Rory in the study. Any way I could get a picture?"
"LORELAI: I can send you one."
"SHERRY: That would be great! So she's outside?"
"LORELAI: Somewhere."
"SHERRY: I'm gonna try to corral her."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, bring her by so I can see her too."
"SHERRY: Okay. Bye Lorelai. Thanks for everything."
"LORELAI: Oh, you're welcome. Bye."
"[Sherry walks out, Christopher sits down with Lorelai]"
"CHRISTOPHER: So, quaint evening of theater last night."
"LORELAI: Ah yes, the Gilmore family players rival the Barrymores for their sophisticated, dramatic productions."
"CHRISTOPHER: I never thought she'd freak over Rory not being there like that. I never wanted to put you in that position."
"LORELAI: Oh, you couldn't have known."
"CHRISTOPHER: I mean, Rory's missed the occasional dinner before."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, this was compounded by other things."
"CHRISTOPHER: What other things?"
"LORELAI: You should know as well as I that when it comes to Emily Gilmore, it's never simple."
"CHRISTOPHER: Got it. Ah, looks like they found each other. You know, Sherry had a really good time last night. I hope Rory did too."
"LORELAI: Yeah, she seemed to."
"CHRISTOPHER: Good, good."
"LORELAI: So Chris, before you go, um, I have something I wanna say to you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh oh."
"LORELAI: It's not an uh oh."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, what?"
"LORELAI: Well, I, um, I kind of realized something with you and Sherry visiting and God help me, because of something my mother said to me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Wow, inspiration can come from the unlikeliest sources."
"LORELAI: I was just thinking, you know, all these years, no matter what my relationship status has been, whether I've been dating or hibernating or whatever, I think I've always had you in the back of my mind - you know, the prospect of us being together. But this prospect was sort of indefinitely on hold while you, you know, found yourself and, uh, got your personal life together so that you could really be there for me and especially for Rory. But you and I have been so linked in my mind that I think I have unconsciously sabotaged every decent relationship I've had, including the one with Max, because I was waiting for you, and I shouldn't have been. And now that I see that, and I see you settling down with Sherry, I think I can move beyond it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Good, I'm really glad this is good for you Lorelai."
"LORELAI: It is. Chris?"
"CHRISTOPHER: How dare you put that on me?"
"LORELAI: I'm just thanking you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, don't."
"LORELAI: What's wrong?"
"CHRISTOPHER: What's wrong? Dammit Lorelai, you're dumping fifteen years of unhappiness on me? Fifteen years of not having healthy, lasting relationships on me? You're blaming me for breaking up with Max and not marrying him? That's all my fault?"
"LORELAI: No, I just - ."
"CHRISTOPHER: I did nothing to deserve that."
"LORELAI: I'm not saying that you did."
"CHRISTOPHER: You're as good as saying it."
"LORELAI: No, I'm not."
"CHRISTOPHER: Then what did you expect to come from this divine revelation that you've been so kind to share with me? Did you want me to apologize to you for ruining your life or comfort you and say there, there, everything's gonna be all right' so you can feel okay? Forget it!"
"LORELAI: Chris, wait!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Look, if there's anything else you feel bad about in your life that you wanna dump on my doorstep, just leave a note! [leaves]"
"[Lorelai glances at the counter at Luke, who quickly looks down. Through the window, Christopher hugs Rory goodbye]"

"[Lorelai and Rory are walking toward Luke's]"
"LORELAI: It still hurts."
"RORY: Do you need stitches?"
"LORELAI: Probably."
"RORY: Well, then we should go to a doctor."
"LORELAI: No, no doctors. You go into a hospital, you don't come out again."
"RORY: Well said, Ida Morgenstern."
"LORELAI: I'm starving. I need pancakes."
"RORY: Can I just ask  ."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: What on earth you thought you were doing?"
"LORELAI: I thought I was being a self-sufficient woman."
"RORY: You hate ladders, you hate heights."
"LORELAI: We needed our rain gutters cleaned."
"RORY: Yeah, well, hire somebody."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, aren't we suddenly a Rockefeller."
"RORY: Well, it's better than you k*ll yourself."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic. It's what I do."
"RORY: No more ladders."
"LORELAI: I promise."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: I think I have gangrene."
"RORY: You do not."
"LORELAI: And vertigo."
"RORY: Oh boy."
"LORELAI: And one leg suddenly feels shorter than the other."
"RORY: This is gonna be the Vanity Fair paper cut incident all over again, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Wow!"
"RORY: Leave your bandage alone."
"LORELAI: Look, it's turning purple, but a really glowy purple. Look!"
"RORY: No, thanks."
"LORELAI: Hm. Maybe our rain gutters are radioactive or made out of some kind of alien metal so that when I cut my hand I got infected with an extraterrestrial substance which is altering my internal makeup. Ugh, maybe I'll turn into a superhero."
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Like, maybe tomorrow I'll wake up and suddenly be able to shower really fast."
"RORY: We'll go pick out your cape after breakfast."
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: God, I'm starving. Must be from the loss of blood."
"RORY: Yes, that must be it."
"LORELAI: I'm getting pancakes with a side of pancakes. Where's Luke?"
"RORY: I don't know. Storage room?"
"LORELAI: Oh no."
"RORY: Caesar's cooking."
"LORELAI: Why is Caesar cooking?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: That's bad."
"RORY: His pancakes stink."
"LORELAI: They do stink."
"RORY: Well, what do we do? Resort to doughnuts."
"LORELAI: Wait here."
"[Lorelai walks over to the stairway to Luke's apartment]"
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS"
"[Lorelai knocks on Luke's apartment door]"
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, are you in there?"
"LUKE: Ow!"
"LORELAI: Luke, are you okay?"
"LUKE: Stupid box! Stupid lamp!"
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, are you being attacked by your possessions again?"
"[Luke opens the door]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"LUKE: Hi."
"LORELAI: Whatcha doing?"
"LUKE: I'm looking for my supply ledger."
"LORELAI: Is it going well?"
"LUKE: It's going fine."
"LORELAI: You have a sock on your shoulder. Is it helping you look?"
"LUKE: What are you doing up here?"
"LORELAI: Rory and I are starving. We need you to cook us breakfast. [she walks into the apartment] Oh my God."
"LUKE: Caesar can make you breakfast."
"LORELAI: What happened to this place?"
"LUKE: Nothing."
"LORELAI: This is what I always pictured the inside of my head to look like."
"LUKE: See if you can find a brown leather ledger."
"LORELAI: I've never seen so much stuff. It looks like a white trash Hearst Castle in here."
"LUKE: On second thought, I'll find it myself."
"LORELAI: Where'd all this come from?"
"LUKE: Jess. Liz shipped the rest of his stuff last week. He finally unpacked."
"LORELAI: Well, he did a very nice job."
"LUKE: I know it's crazy now, but I just have to get it all organized, figure out where to put everything, buy another dresser, a portable wardrobe, some storage bins."
"LORELAI: Can of gasoline, box of matches."
"LUKE: Did I mention that Caesar can cook you breakfast?"
"LORELAI: But he doesn't make the good fluffy pancakes like you do."
"LUKE: Then order eggs."
"LORELAI: No! See, I had a near death experience today."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. I almost fell off the roof of my house trying to clean the rain gutters, so I have to have pancakes. Please? I'll help you shower when I become a superhero."
"[Jess walks out of the bathroom]"
"LUKE: You've been in there for two hours."
"JESS: Yeah, well my hair just ain't bouncin' and behavin' today."
"LUKE: There are other people living here too, you know."
"JESS: Huh, learn something new everyday. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Well, his people k*ll are really improving."
"LUKE: Go downstairs. I'll be there as soon as I can."
"LORELAI: How long is that?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: An estimate."
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Ballpark figure."
"LUKE: I - ."
"LORELAI: Off the top of your head."
"LUKE: Will you "
"LORELAI: Did I mention that I almost fell off my roof today?"
"LUKE: I'd lie down if I could find the bed."
"[Lorelai sees the supply ledger and picks it up]"
"LORELAI: Oh, is this what you're looking for?"
"LUKE: Yes, great, thank you."
"LORELAI: Not unless you make me the pancakes."
"LUKE: Give me the book."
"LORELAI: Give me the pancake!"
"LUKE: Come on."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: You sure you weren't almost pushed off the roof of your house today?"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[That night, Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street]"
"LORELAI: Well, I think I'm finally ready to get a tattoo."
"RORY: Oh please."
"LORELAI: I am."
"RORY: You've been saying that for the last five years."
"LORELAI: I know, but I mean it this time."
"RORY: Fine, what are you getting?"
"LORELAI: Mel Brooks."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: What do you mean, why? The Two Thousand Year Old Man, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie  you don't think Mel has earned the right to have his face on my butt?"
"RORY: I am so sorry, Mel."
"LORELAI: Oh, he'll love it, trust me. So, rocky road hot fudge sundaes and two cans of whipped cream to go with the movies?"
"RORY: Trying to give Mel a bigger canvas to work with?"
"LORELAI: Hey, the man's a legend, he deserves the best."
"[As they pass the diner, Lorelai notices Luke inside sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Luke."
"RORY: What's he doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm not sure. Hey, will you go get the ice cream and make sure they give us a ton of maraschino cherries?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S"
"[Luke is sitting at a table watching a very small television set as Lorelai knocks on the door]"
"LORELAI: Hey"
"LUKE: Hey, what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Oh, uh, Rory and I just hit the video store. Now we're on our way home to eat a large amount of something you would not approve of."
"LUKE: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"LUKE: Oh, watching TV."
"LORELAI: Ah. Wow, that's cute. Is this the first time it's been away from its mother?"
"LUKE: It's a very good TV."
"LORELAI: Hm, black and white, coat hanger antenna, really bad reception."
"LUKE: It's fine."
"LORELAI: Don't you have a fully grown TV upstairs?"
"LUKE: Yeah, well, Jess is upstairs."
"LORELAI: So?"
"LUKE: So when Jess is upstairs, that means the stereo's blaring and the place is a mess. I just needed a little privacy."
"LORELAI: So you came downstairs."
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: To sit on an uncomfortable chair in an empty diner that smells like onion rings."
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Calgon, take me away."
"LUKE: It was very peaceful until two minutes ago."
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, do you ever think that, uh, maybe you should get a bigger apartment?"
"LUKE: I don't need a bigger apartment."
"LORELAI: That place upstairs was your father's office. You turned it into an apartment. It was never meant to be lived in."
"LUKE: It's fine."
"LORELAI: It's too small for two people. It's too small for one person if they have any kind of life."
"LUKE: We'll make due, we just need to organize."
"LORELAI: No, you don't need to organize. You need to move."
"LUKE: I like my apartment."
"LORELAI: It's not just your apartment. Jess lives there also."
"LUKE: Jess is fine."
"LORELAI: Are you sure? Because he could be pinned down under a box for a year in that place and you wouldn't know it until the neighbors started to complain about the smell."
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hey Luke."
"LUKE: Rory, perfect, get her out of here. Go."
"LORELAI: But, uh, okay, fine. I'm leaving. Think about what I said."
"LUKE: Oh, hey, did you ever hire anybody to do that work for you?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: The rain gutters."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, not yet. Are you offering?"
"LUKE: No, actually, I was thinking about Jess."
"LORELAI: Uh, Jess?"
"LUKE: Yeah, he's always looking for a little extra cash. He doesn't make that much here, and, you know, I hate to think of where else he might try to get it, so"
"LORELAI: Huh."
"LUKE: I mean, you don't have to pay him the same as would someone else, and you save a little, he keeps busy."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, maybe. Um, I actually have to check with a couple of people I'm supposed to hear from, but if they can't do it, then sure."
"LUKE: Great, just let me know."
"LORELAI: I will. Bye."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the diner]"
"RORY: So who are all these people you asked to clean out our gutters?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, you know."
"RORY: I do?"
"LORELAI: Sh-yeah."
"RORY: Remind me."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, there's Sid."
"RORY: Oh, Sid, right."
"LORELAI: And then there's Lou."
"RORY: Yeah, a good man, Lou."
"LORELAI: Oh, and also Moose. That is, if Doris will let him out of the house again, you know, after that incident at Chicky's bachelor party."
"RORY: I thought you said you were gonna give Jess a chance."
"LORELAI: I am."
"RORY: Then why don't you hire him?"
"LORELAI: I'm just not very comfortable with him, Rory."
"RORY: Well, try and get comfortable."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know if I can."
"RORY: But you said - ."
"LORELAI: I know what I said, but I can't help it."
"RORY: How many times do I have to tell you  ."
"LORELAI: That I don't know the real Jess?"
"RORY: You don't."
"LORELAI: Well, fine, I don't know him, but I'm not too fond of his stand in."
"RORY: People are different once you get to know them. If you'll remember, you weren't too fond of Luke when you first met him."
"LORELAI: That's not true."
"RORY: You called him Duke for two years just to make him mad."
"LORELAI: And let me tell you, it worked."
"RORY: But then you guys talked and eventually, time went by, and now you love him."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"RORY: I'm just asking you to give Jess that same chance."
"LORELAI: Rory, you like him. I don't have to like him."
"RORY: Please?"
"LORELAI: Can I at least call him Tess for a little while?"
"RORY: You'll give him the job?"
"LORELAI: I'll give him the job."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: You're welcome. Tell me something."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Why is it so important to you that I like him?"
"RORY: Well, I just think that he's Luke's nephew and we like Luke and we eat at Luke's everyday, and we see Jess when we eat there everyday, and that it just might make things nicer if you liked him."
"LORELAI: And that's the only reason?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: It's all about Luke and the diner?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: It has nothing to do with you?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: So you and Jess aren't friends?"
"RORY: Well, yeah, we're friends."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: I mean, we're not good friends but we're friends. We're friendly. But that doesn't mean that we're friends in the traditional Webster's dictionary definition of friends."
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: Friendish might be a better term."
"LORELAI: Okay, friendish. Got it."
"[They pass by a group of walkers that Miss Patty is instructing from a golf cart.]"
"MISS PATTY: And walk, and walk, and pump your arms and walk. And shoulders back, tucus in, think about that double chin and walk and walk and walk and tummies tight and walk. Match me sweetheart."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke walks in, Jess is asleep, music is blaring.]"
"LUKE: Jess? [Luke turns the music off] How can anyone sleep through that? It's like the Huns are attacking and you're just  well, you're oblivious and that's why you can just lie there while the rest of the world is going - . [he knocks over his little television] Great! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!"
"JESS: Whoa, geez, what the hell?"
"LUKE: I can't stand it, I'm going crazy. This place is awful. I can't live like this anymore."
"JESS: Just relax."
"LUKE: I can't relax. I can't sleep. I'm having nightmares about being chased around by boxes with arms and they tackle me and pile clothing on top of my face and secure it around my head with packing tape and I'm just lying there choking while you're sitting in the corner laughing, putting gel in your hair with a switchblade!"
"JESS: Should I be putting a tongue depressor in your mouth right about now?"
"LUKE: We're moving."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: Tomorrow."
"JESS: What are you talking about?"
"LUKE: I'm talking about you and me going out, getting a paper, and finding a new place to live."
"JESS: But I  ."
"LUKE: No buts. Ten o'clock tomorrow morning I want you up, washed, moussed, and ready to leave, end of story. Now go back to bed. What?"
"JESS: I need the music on to sleep."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[The next day, Luke and Jess walk out of an apartment building]"
"JESS: Forget it."
"LUKE: Why, what was wrong with that one?"
"JESS: It was pink."
"LUKE: We can paint it."
"JESS: You mean I can paint it."
"LUKE: We can paint it together."
"JESS: Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards."
"LUKE: Fine, which one do you like?"
"JESS: The one before."
"LUKE: The one with the two fridges?"
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: Well, the one before was the one with two fridges."
"JESS: No, the one we saw before was the one with the cat."
"LUKE: I hate cats."
"JESS: Well, I don't think the cat came with the place."
"LUKE: Yeah, but it had carpeting which means it's always gonna smell like a cat."
"JESS: Clean the carpet."
"LUKE: Paint the pink."
"JESS: Fine, the one next to the bank."
"LUKE: Too many windows."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: Six windows all on one side, three o'clock in the afternoon  we're sitting in an oven."
"JESS: So we get curtains."
"LUKE: Well, you'll have to help me put them up."
"JESS: Great, then we can hold hands and skip afterwards."
"LUKE: Stop saying that."
"JESS: You know what, I don't care. Pick whichever one you want."
"LUKE: I'm not picking by myself."
"JESS: You're the one who wants to move."
"LUKE: Oh, so you like living the way we do?"
"JESS: Fine by me."
"LUKE: No space, no privacy."
"JESS: I got plenty of privacy."
"LUKE: Yeah, because I'm sitting downstairs in the dark watching a two-inch V."
"JESS: Hey, you're the one with the problem, you make the choice."
"LUKE: Jess, come on."
"JESS: I have to go."
"LUKE: We got three more places to look at."
"JESS: I'm supposed to be at Lorelai's in twenty minutes, remember?"
"LUKE: Oh, yeah."
"JESS: I mean, if you want me to bail on her, fine."
"LUKE: Nah, you go. I'll look at the places all alone."
"JESS: Great idea."
"LUKE: I'll take some Polaroids and you can take a look at them later."
"JESS: Take a Polaroid, paint a still picture, whatever you want."
"LUKE: Jess, come on."
"JESS: Hey, nobody asked me if I wanted to move to Stars Hollow, but I'm here. Pick whatever place you want and I'll be there too."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch as Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Come here, come here, come here."
"RORY: I'm here, what's the matter?"
"LORELAI: Sit, sit, sit. Okay, that should do it."
"RORY: Do what?"
"LORELAI: Wait."
"RORY: What are we waiting for?"
"LORELAI: Patience, grasshopper."
"RORY: Are we close?"
"LORELAI: Very close. Hm, getting closer."
"RORY: Should I get chips?"
"LORELAI: Ready, and  ."
"[They stare at a digital clock. When it changes, the clock starts making pig noises.]"
"RORY: The clock is grunting."
"LORELAI: This, my friend, is a state of the art CD/clock radio that enables you to wake up to the barnyard animal of your choice."
"RORY: That is great."
"LORELAI: I have selected the perky piggies. You might choose the cheery chickens or the goofy goats."
"RORY: That is closest to a farm that I ever wanna get."
"LORELAI: Amen, sister friend."
"[There's a knock at the front door]"
"RORY: I'll get it. [answers the door] Hey."
"JESS: Here. [tosses her a CD]"
"RORY: The Shaggs?"
"JESS: Trust me"
"RORY: Okay. So you're very punctual."
"JESS: Yeah, well, it was this or continue apartment hunting with Luke."
"RORY: You're moving?"
"JESS: I don't know. Luke flipped out last night and next thing I know, he's dragging me all over town banging on pipes and measuring square footage. It's crazy."
"RORY: A new place might be nice. More space, maybe you'll get your own room."
"JESS: You change your hair?"
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: Your hair looks different."
"RORY: So, segue's not your thing, huh?"
"JESS: Is it?"
"RORY: Well, um, no, I wear it like this a lot. Why?"
"JESS: Just looks different."
"RORY: Oh, bad different?"
"LORELAI: [from living room] Hey, ducks!"
"RORY: We just got a new alarm clock."
"JESS: Huh. Bet I know what the lead story in the Stars Hollow Gazette's gonna be tomorrow."
"[Lorelai walks to the front door]"
"LORELAI: Hey, did you hear the ducks cause they're great. Oh Jess, you're here, terrific."
"RORY: So, um, would you like to come in?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, come on in. Sorry, it's just. . .so excited about the ducks that, uh. . .do you want something to drink? You have good timing cause we shopped yesterday, and in addition to a case of Maybelline Fresh Lash Mascara, I also bought some of that new, uh, freaky Coke with the lemon in it. It's very addictive."
"RORY: You can sit, you know."
"JESS: No thanks."
"LORELAI: So, Jess, what's new?"
"JESS: Not much."
"RORY: Jess and Luke are looking for an apartment."
"LORELAI: Oh, you guys see anything good yet?"
"JESS: Nope."
"LORELAI: Well, you know, there's some really cool places over on Peach. Or on Plum. Hm, Orange. Basically, any of your fruit named streets are pretty nice. Okay, well, I guess you should get started. Um, there's a ladder right out front and some buckets and gloves and stuff on the porch. You need anything else, just walk against the wind."
"RORY: Come on, I'll show you."
"[Jess walks out the door]"
"LORELAI: I'm trying."
"RORY: Well, keep it up."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory walks out of the house and over to Jess]"
"RORY: Question."
"JESS: Yes?"
"RORY: You come over. You seem to have a very firm grasp of the English language. You put together several full sentences, even using a couple of words that contain two or more syllables, and then my mother appears and suddenly we need a thought bubble over your head to understand what you're thinking. Can you tell me why that is?"
"JESS: The verbal thing comes and goes."
"RORY: I would really appreciate it if you would try to get along with my mom."
"JESS: I took the Coke."
"RORY: I know."
"JESS: Personally, I think it's a little crazy to put lemon in Coke but I took it anyhow."
"RORY: Stop it."
"JESS: Ooh, stern face."
"RORY: Look, I went out on a limb for you trying to get my mom to give you the benefit of the doubt, okay? So I don't think it would hurt you to try to be nice."
"JESS: Why?"
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Yeah, why?"
"RORY: Because she's my mom and she's a friend of Luke's."
"JESS: So?"
"RORY: What do you mean, so?"
"JESS: So just because she's your mom or Luke's friend doesn't mean that I automatically have to get along with her."
"RORY: Jess, my mother is a great person. She's also my best friend in the world, so if you care about me at all, you will take that into consideration and you will be mildly polite to her."
"JESS: What makes you think I care about you?"
"RORY: I don't mean care care, like care. I mean if you like me at all. . . not like like. I just meant that if. . . if you think of me remotely as the sort of person that you could occasionally stand to talk to then you will try to get along with my mom, that's all."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Okay?"
"JESS: I can't guarantee that it'll work, but I'll try."
"RORY: Thank you."
"JESS: You're welcome. I should probably get to work."
"RORY: Right. Sorry, go ahead."
"CUT TO FRONT OF STARS HOLLOW LIBRARY"
"[Several tables and racks of books are set up for the Buy a Book Fundraiser. Dean is sitting on the steps of the library as Rory walks over with some books.]"
"RORY: Inherit the Wind, seventy-five cents."
"DEAN: Great."
"RORY: Now, here's a copy of Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet  which I already have, but in hardback. This is a paperback  fits perfectly in a coat pocket and it's only a dollar. I'm torn. Opinions?"
"DEAN: Get it."
"RORY: You look bored."
"DEAN: I'm fine."
"RORY: You sure you don't wanna look around? They have great stuff here."
"DEAN: I looked."
"RORY: For five minutes."
"DEAN: No, I looked for twenty minutes and then I stopped and you continued for another two hours."
"RORY: It has not been that long. Oh, sorry."
"DEAN: No big deal."
"RORY: Let's go."
"DEAN: Are you done?"
"RORY: Yup, I've looked enough."
"DEAN: You're not done."
"RORY: No, I'm fine, really. Let's go."
"DEAN: Rory, stop it. You wanna keep looking, I know you."
"RORY: No, I wanna hang out with you."
"DEAN: Are you sure?"
"RORY: Yes, I'll just pay for these and then we can go."
"DEAN: I thought maybe we can go see The Lord of the Rings again."
"RORY: Oh, okay."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"DEAN: Well, I thought you loved The Lord of the Rings."
"RORY: I do."
"DEAN: You said you wanted to see it a hundred times."
"RORY: Yes, and apparently we're being very literal these days."
"DEAN: Fine, we'll see something else."
"RORY: Lord of the Rings is fine. Can you help me with these?"
"[They walk to the cash register]"
"KIRK: I'll give you fifty-five cents."
"GYPSY: It's sixty-five."
"KIRK: Fifty-five cents."
"GYPSY: Kirk, it's for charity. There's no haggling."
"KIRK: Oh no, there's always haggling. Sixty cents."
"GYPSY: No."
"KIRK: That's my final offer."
"GYPSY: I'm sorry, I can't."
"KIRK: Fine."
"GYPSY: Kirk, come on."
"KIRK: No."
"GYPSY: Cough up another nickel."
"KIRK: Forget it  it's the principal of the thing. [walks away]"
"GYPSY: Wow, you made out like a bandit."
"RORY: Well, you've got great stuff this year."
"GYPSY: Hey, did you see the astronomy section over there?"
"RORY: Oh, yeah."
"GYPSY: Didn't find anything?"
"RORY: Nope."
"DEAN: Wait, I didn't see you look over there."
"RORY: Well, I did."
"DEAN: Go look."
"RORY: I told you I'm done."
"DEAN: Hey, where. . . where's your bracelet?"
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: You're not wearing your bracelet."
"RORY: Oh."
"DEAN: Where is it?"
"RORY: I took it off."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: Well, because I got this weird rash on my wrist."
"DEAN: From the bracelet?"
"RORY: Oh no, just a fluke thing. Actually, I think my Spanish midterm gave it to me."
"DEAN: Oh."
"RORY: But it's getting better  it's almost gone."
"DEAN: Well, good."
"RORY: And as soon as it's completely gone, that bracelet goes right back on."
"DEAN: So, uh, compromise."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: You go look at the astronomy section, we'll go see Lord of the Rings, and on the way home we'll rent Autumn in New York and mock it for the rest of the afternoon."
"RORY: With full-on impressions?"
"DEAN: With full-on impressions."
"RORY: Deal."
"DEAN: Go, I'll wait here. Smiling, not at all bored."
"KIRK: Sixty-two cents."
"GYPSY: Get out of here Kirk."
"KIRK: Damn."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen, takes several containers of Chinese food out of the refrigerator, then walks outside.]"
"LORELAI: Jess? Hey, Jess!"
"JESS: Sorry, too loud?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, it's fine. Uh, it's just. . . I got a ton of leftover Chinese food in the kitchen. I thought you might like some lunch."
"JESS: No thanks."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"JESS: Chinese sounds great."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"JESS: If you're sure you have enough."
"LORELAI: There's plenty. Rory and I decided to take on the entire chicken column last night."
"JESS: Ambitious."
"LORELAI: Well, it's all out on the table, so come in when you're ready."
"JESS: I'm ready now."
"LORELAI: Okay, then I'll see you inside."
""
""
""
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"LORELAI: So, um, basically everything here is chicken. You've got garlic chicken, Kung Pao chicken, Szechuan Chicken, chicken in brown sauce, which looks and tastes remarkably like the Szechuan Chicken except it's got these red peppers in it and if you eat them, you die. Plate?"
"JESS: I thought I'd, uh. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, soap's on the counter."
"JESS: So when was the last time you had those gutters cleaned?"
"LORELAI: It's been awhile."
"JESS: Yeah, I found an I like Ike' bumper sticker up there."
"LORELAI: Is it really bad?"
"JESS: Well, it won't be by tomorrow."
"LORELAI: I like hearing that."
"JESS: So you guys aren't too hot on vegetables, huh?"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? There's green pepper in the Kung Pao."
"JESS: My mistake."
"LORELAI: So, are you a healthy eater like Luke?"
"JESS: No. No one's a healthy eater like Luke. Yule Gibbons wasn't a healthy eater like Luke."
"LORELAI: Wow, it's been ages since I've heard a good Yule Gibbons reference."
"JESS: Many parts of a pine tree are edible."
"LORELAI: That's right. God, I wonder what the research process was like to get that information."
"JESS: I'd say fairly painful."
"LORELAI: Huh. Here. So how's school?"
"JESS: It's still there."
"LORELAI: You on any teams or anything?"
"JESS: No, no, no."
"LORELAI: Not a jersey guy?"
"JESS: No, definitely not a jersey guy. Though the thought of throwing a ball at some jock's head isn't entirely unappealing. Look, I'm not really good at this small talk thing."
"LORELAI: You're doing okay. Cold egg roll?"
"JESS: Why not? [takes a bite]"
"LORELAI: Bad?"
"JESS: Oh yeah."
"[the front door slams and Rory yells from off camera]"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Here  right here! What?"
"RORY: Mom!"
"[cut to front entryway; Rory is looking through all the coat pockets as Lorelai walks over]"
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"RORY: I don't know where it is!"
"LORELAI: Where what is?"
"RORY: My bracelet  it's gone."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: How could I do this? How could I lose that bracelet?"
"[Rory starts looking in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Honey, tell me which bracelet  maybe I stole it from you."
"RORY: Dean's bracelet."
"LORELAI: The one he made you?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: It's gone?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: I don't know where. If I knew where then I would have it."
"LORELAI: Well, when did you first notice it was gone?"
"RORY: When he pointed out that I wasn't wearing it."
"LORELAI: Oh, not good. What did you say?"
"RORY: That I had a rash and that I had to take it off until it healed."
"LORELAI: Nice save, Gretzky."
"RORY: It's not here, it's not here. God."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's retrace your steps. When was the last time you remember wearing it?"
"RORY: Um, I don't know."
"LORELAI: Think hard  yesterday?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: The day before?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: The day before that?"
"RORY: Um, yeah."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: No, I don't remember. I can't remember. Help me move the couch."
"LORELAI: What about your locker at school?"
"RORY: I don't know why it would be there, I never take it off at school. I never take it off at all."
"LORELAI: Anything?"
"RORY: Just Grandma's pen."
"LORELAI: Leave it there."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: It makes life fun"
"RORY: I'm gonna freak out now."
"LORELAI: We'll find it."
"RORY: I'm gonna have to tell Dean that I lost his bracelet."
"LORELAI: Let's not even go there yet."
"RORY: He made it for me."
"LORELAI: He'll make you another one."
"RORY: But he's gonna be mad."
"LORELAI: He'll understand."
"RORY: How do you know?"
"LORELAI: I'm looking at the track record and all signs point to he'll understand. Did you look in your room?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: All right, I'll check the car. And don't worry  if worse comes to worse and we can't find it, we'll follow Dean to work, hide behind the cantaloupes, jump him, blind him and he'll never find out."
"RORY: As long as we have a plan."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel is standing at the front desk; Lorelai is on the floor behind the desk]"
"MICHEL: Who is Randy Mill?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, let me see. Maintenance."
"MICHEL: Are you going to be down there long?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I just wanna to make sure Rory's bracelet didn't get kicked back behind something."
"MICHEL: Hmm, and so earlier when you told me to look for the bracelet and I told you I did look and I did not find it, you"
"LORELAI: Just decided to double check."
"MICHEL: Yes, though another theory is that you did not believe me."
"LORELAI: I did too."
"MICHEL: No, I believe you thought I was lying. That I did not actually get down on my hands and knees in a brand new Donna Karan suit and crawl around on a floor where people who have stepped in mud and garbage and animal waste have been traipsing all day long."
"LORELAI: It's not there."
"MICHEL: No? Why, I'm shocked."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm sorry I doubted you, Michel."
"MICHEL: Well, that means a lot, thank you."
"LORELAI: We turned the house upside down. Rory's having a heart attack. It's just awful."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, as soon as my dry cleaning bill is paid for, you will have my sympathies."
"LORELAI: I will pay for your suit, Michel."
"MICHEL: Mm hmm."
"[phone rings]"
"MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Hold on please. [to Lorelai] It's for you."
"LORELAI: Lorelai here."
"LUKE: I don't want a wood-burning fireplace."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: But if I take an apartment with a wood-burning fireplace, even though I could give a rat's ass about a wood-burning fireplace, I have to pay an extra two hundred dollars a month for the wood-burning fireplace."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but - ."
"LUKE: And three of the places make you put down a five hundred dollar deposit if you have a dog. Can you believe this?"
"LORELAI: You don't have a dog."
"LUKE: I know, but it's wrong."
"LORELAI: Agreed. What else?"
"LUKE: Parking."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"LUKE: How can people ask you for a monthly fee for a parking space? I mean, they're making money off your rent, off your utilities, when you use their coin-operated washer and dryer  that's cash directly in their pocket. And by the way, it's not even that good a parking space. It's out in the open under one of those trees that drops the sap on your car that eats away your paint."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: Who's gonna pay for my car, huh? Where's my five hundred dollar, k*ll tree sap deposit?"
"LORELAI: You haven't found a place yet?"
"LUKE: And I've been looking all day."
"LORELAI: There wasn't one place you liked?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Not one place that gave you a little feeling of, Huh, well that has a nice vibe about it.'"
"LUKE: I don't use the word vibe."
"LORELAI: Luke."
"LUKE: Maybe one place wasn't so bad."
"LORELAI: Oh good, describe it to me."
"LUKE: I don't know. It had walls with a kind of a floor with a light."
"LORELAI: Okay, hold on here, mister. If you tell me it's got a roof, I'm stealing that baby out from under you."
"LUKE: I just can't tell anymore. I need a second opinion."
"LORELAI: Do you want me to come look at your apartment?"
"LUKE: It's not my apartment, and yes."
"LORELAI: Done."
"LUKE: Now."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Please?"
"LORELAI: Uh, well -."
"LUKE: I promised the woman I'd give her an answer today."
"LORELAI: Okay, give me the address."
"LUKE: Sixty-two and a half B Street. And that's another thing  what's with this half business? Why do all these apartments have this half thing going? It's stupid. If sixty-two is taken, move on to sixty-three."
"LORELAI: Luke, I'll meet you there in twenty and a half minutes."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up] Michel, I have to go out for a little while. Cover the desk for me."
"MICHEL: Mm hmm."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MICHEL: Well, I mean, I'll say I'll cover the desk, but how will you know if I'm actually doing it?"
"LORELAI: I trust you, Michel."
"MICHEL: I mean, it's just as possible I say I'll cover the desk, and the moment you've stepped away I'll put some fruit on my head and join a conga line somewhere."
"LORELAI: I believe you looked for the bracelet."
"MICHEL: And while I'm shaking it to the Miami Sound Machine, the phones here  they would ring and ring and ring, and no one to answer, no one to assist."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye Mom."
"CUT TO APARTMENT BUILDING"
"[The real estate agent leads Luke and Lorelai through the apartment]"
"MARY: It's a very quiet street and the owner keeps the building up beautifully. He hasn't remodeled it at all. Plus, I bet he could be persuaded to give the floor a little spruce if you like."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, we'd like a spruce."
"LUKE: A spruce is unnecessary."
"LORELAI: Hey, you never turn down a spruce."
"MARY: She's right  listen to her."
"LORELAI: Yeah, listen to me."
"LUKE: You rarely give me a choice."
"LORELAI: Come here so I can lick your face."
"LUKE: What?"
"MARY: Now, I went over the square footage and the details of the lease with your husband this morning. Did he fill you in?"
"LUKE: What? Oh no, we're  ."
"LORELAI: No, no, he didn't, but you know how men are. The minute that ball game comes on, all the realities of life just go right out the window."
"MARY: Don't I know it."
"LORELAI: I mean, I could answer the door wrapped in cellophane but unless I was wearing a Yankees cap. . .ugh, he wouldn't even notice."
"LUKE: Geez."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't be embarrassed Snuffy, I'm just teasing. It'd be a Mets cap."
"LUKE: Hey Mary, could you possibly leave me and little missus alone for just a minute?"
"MARY: Why, of course."
"LORELAI: I promise we won't do anything dirty."
"MARY: Oh please, if my husband and I looked anything like the two of you, we'd never get dressed."
"LORELAI: Oh, you are bad!"
"MARY: Let me just leave this rental agreement with you in case you decide to fill it out."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"MARY: Oh, I hope you take it. It's got a great vibe for a nice couple like you two. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Oh, thirteen different shades of red!"
"LUKE: What is wrong with you?"
"LORELAI: You make it too easy."
"LUKE: By standing here?"
"LORELAI: Oh, relax Snuffy. Let's talk. What do you think?"
"LUKE: She used the word vibe."
"LORELAI: About the apartment."
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Okay then, break it down. List your concerns."
"LUKE: Well, it's too big."
"LORELAI: It's not too big. Next."
"LUKE: I don't need two bathrooms."
"LORELAI: Yes, you do. Next."
"LUKE: I like being on the bottom floor."
"LORELAI: The top floor's quieter. Next."
"LUKE: You know, somehow I think this would be easier if you just listed your concerns first."
"LORELAI: Okay. Um. . .I don't have any. I think it's great."
"LUKE: You do?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's light and airy. It's got good windows but not too many so that the sun bakes you in the afternoon."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: You're close to work, the price seems good, you're taking the spruce, and it's a two-year lease. What's two years?"
"LUKE: I don't know. I - ."
"LORELAI: Luke, you need to do this. You and Jess will k*ll each other if you stay in that place of yours."
"LUKE: Yeah, but who knows how long he's gonna be here."
"LORELAI: Why? Did something happen?"
"LUKE: No, but you never know."
"LORELAI: No, you don't, but I think his mom sending his stuff is a pretty good sign."
"LUKE: And even if he does stay, it'll be only for another year, and then he'll go off to college or Attica or whatever, and it'll just be me again."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but - ."
"LUKE: And stuck with a new apartment, probably with neighbors I hate who are constantly cooking really strong smelling food."
"LORELAI: Okay, back up here. Yes, Jess may go off somewhere someday, but that doesn't mean you will be alone forever."
"LUKE: I am not getting a pet."
"LORELAI: I'm talking about a lady friend."
"LUKE: Oh."
"LORELAI: A red-hot mama."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: A big, pretty dish of lovin' with a spoon made especially for you."
"LUKE: Boy, do I not feel good now."
"LORELAI: Luke, Rachel's not the only woman in the world for you. You'll meet someone, someday -- probably at a Timberland store, you'll ask her out. You'll pick her up and take her on a patented Luke Danes night of romance -- juice bar followed by the batting cages -- and then you'll ask her back to your apartment."
"LUKE: Any amount of money if you stop right now."
"LORELAI: You'll bring her back to your place, lead her upstairs to the apartment door. You pause, gaze into her eyes  the stage is set, fate is waiting. You open the door, and she sees your teeny, tiny apartment  one room and no closet space and Jess' feet sticking up in the air cause you never did get rid of that body!"
"LUKE: Stop, please."
"LORELAI: And to make matters worse, she spots it: the single bed."
"LUKE: What's wrong with a single bed?"
"LORELAI: You know what they say."
"LUKE: No, what do they say?"
"LORELAI: Never, ever date a guy who owns a single bed. It means he's not open to a commitment."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It says there's no room in this life for anybody but me."
"LUKE: No, it says there's no room in this bed for anyone but me."
"LORELAI: Okay, see, that's not a whole lot better."
"LUKE: This discussion is now over."
"LORELAI: Luke, as long as you're in that apartment, you're gonna have a single bed. Don't you want the possibility of more? Come on Luke, it's time. Make a move, take a sh*t, entertain the possibility of a b*mb existence. What do you say?"
"LUKE: You got a pen? I'm not taking the spruce."
"LORELAI: Yes, you are."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai arrives home and walks into the kitchen as Jess walks out of Rory's room]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"LORELAI: Did you get lost?"
"JESS: No, I was looking at Rory's books."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"JESS: I wanted to see if she had Franny and Zooey. She does."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"JESS: I was gonna get it for her if she didn't."
"LORELAI: That's very nice of you."
"JESS: Yeah. Okay, so I should probably get back to work."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Luke is shopping as Taylor walks up to him]"
"TAYLOR: Luke, good good goody good good. I was just on my way over to the diner to talk to you."
"LUKE: Great. Go on over, I'll meet you there."
"TAYLOR: Oh, stop it, this isn't about anything that's gonna make you mad. I just have a couple of questions about your application."
"LUKE: What?"
"TAYLOR: Your application. Now I called your bank - ."
"LUKE: What application?"
"TAYLOR: Your application for the apartment. Now you have two accounts here -."
"LUKE: How did you get my application?"
"TAYLOR: Well, Mary gave it to me, of course. Now I'm assuming that one of those accounts -."
"LUKE: Why would Mary give you my application?"
"TAYLOR: Because I own the building."
"LUKE: What? When the hell did you buy an apartment building?"
"TAYLOR: Well, I bought this particular one about two months ago."
"LUKE: I look at a thousand apartments, I choose yours. How is that possible?"
"TAYLOR: Well, count yourself lucky, you. With me as the owner, there is a level of quality control that is sorely lacking in this town. For example, at all my properties, we measure the grass before, during, and after mowing to attain a perfect inch and a half height, which is both pleasing to the eye and good for the grass."
"LUKE: All of your properties?"
"TAYLOR: Ten in all."
"LUKE: Ten properties? What are you, buying up the town?"
"TAYLOR: Not yet, but someday  who knows?"
"LUKE: But why isn't anyone stopping you?"
"TAYLOR: Because, my friend, people are lazy. They don't wanna think about the proper fabric for an awning or the correct historical color for a building. They just slap any old thing up on a wall and sleep like babies. But soon, hopefully, the city council will put an end to that."
"LUKE: Taylor, you cannot tell people what color to paint their buildings!"
"TAYLOR: Well, someone has to."
"LUKE: No, they don't. We don't live in a fascist country."
"TAYLOR: Oh, this isn't about the fascists  who, by the way, had their faults but their parks were spotless."
"LUKE: I have to get out of here. [leaves]"
"TAYLOR: Hey, eh, wait a minute."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Taylor follows Luke down the sidewalk]"
"TAYLOR: Luke, hold it! I still need to talk to you."
"LUKE: Just tear up the application, Taylor. I'm not moving."
"TAYLOR: What? Why?"
"LUKE: Cause I'm the two-inch grass kind of guy."
"TAYLOR: Well, that's too bad but I need to talk to you about something else."
"LUKE: What?"
"TAYLOR: I'm thinking about purchasing the flower shop next to the diner, but we need to talk about that sign of yours."
"LUKE: What about my sign?"
"TAYLOR: Well, you have a diner but you never took down the Williams' Hardware sign."
"LUKE: That was my father's sign."
"TAYLOR: I understand that you have a sentimental attachment to the sign, but it confuses the tourists."
"LUKE: Back off the sign, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: If I buy the building next to that sign, I run the risk of people being so busy trying to figure out if you sell hammers or burgers, that they never notice the nice collectible plate store right next door."
"LUKE: Collectible plates?"
"TAYLOR: Isn't that a great idea? Elvis, The b*at, Mary Poppins, all the greats. You can hang them on the wall or you buy a little stand and set them up on the coffee table."
"LUKE: Okay, you need to get away from me now. At least a good arm swinging length away."
"TAYLOR: It's people like you who keep this town from becoming one of great towns in America, Luke."
"LUKE: Arm swinging length!"
"TAYLOR: I wouldn't have approved your application anyway."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Jess climbs down the ladder as Rory comes home and sits on the porch]"
"JESS: You look good."
"RORY: I'm fine."
"JESS: Talk."
"RORY: I lost my bracelet."
"JESS: Uh huh."
"RORY: Dean gave it to me."
"JESS: How thoughtful."
"RORY: I've been all over town looking for it. I've been to Lane's, I've been to Luke's, I've been to the bus stop, I've been to Miss Patty's, and I've circled Stars Hollow twice and nothing. I have no idea what I'm going to do."
"JESS: It's really that big a deal?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"JESS: I mean, I know it's got an I've been pinned' Bye, Bye, Birdie kind of implication to it, but it was just a bracelet."
"RORY: I don't think Dean will see it that way."
"JESS: You didn't lose it on purpose."
"RORY: I know, but things have been a little weird between us lately and. . .you couldn't care less."
"JESS: Oh, yes, I could."
"RORY: I just think Dean will read something into this."
"JESS: Should he?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: I think you should keep looking."
"RORY: Where?"
"JESS: Anywhere. Things you lose are usually right in front of your face. Check the house again."
"RORY: I've checked the house."
"JESS: It's probably just laying in your room somewhere."
"RORY: No, I tore that room apart, it's not there."
"JESS: Fine, give up then. No biggie. Dean'll just have to get over it."
"RORY: I'll go look again."
"JESS: You do that."
"CUT TO INSIDE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch reading as Rory walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, where have you been?"
"RORY: Scouring the town."
"LORELAI: Nothing, huh?"
"RORY: Not yet. I'm gonna check my room again. [goes into room]"
"LORELAI: Haven't you already looked in there like a thousand times."
"RORY: [from bedroom] A thousand and one. Mom, come here, hurry!"
"LORELAI: Rory?"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Are you okay?"
"[cut to Rory's bedroom]"
"RORY: I found it!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I looked under the bed and there it was. I thought I had already looked under the bed, but I don't know, maybe I was too panicked or. . .I don't know, who cares, I got it!"
"LORELAI: Aw, that is amazing!"
"RORY: Put it on."
"LORELAI: Hmm."
"RORY: Make it tight."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm cutting off circulation here, baby."
"RORY: Oh, look at it. It looks even better than before, doesn't it?"
"LORELAI: I think the time away from home did it some good."
"RORY: Okay, when I get back, we celebrate."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"RORY: To tell Lane she can stop praying."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai walks out as Jess is getting ready to leave]"
"LORELAI: You leaving?"
"JESS: Yeah, all done."
"LORELAI: You weren't gonna come get your money?"
"JESS: Ah, I figured I'd get it eventually. It's not like I don't know where you guys live."
"LORELAI: That's true. You certainly do know where we live. Well here. After all, you earned it."
"JESS: Thanks."
"LORELAI: You took it, didn't you?"
"JESS: Excuse me."
"LORELAI: Rory's bracelet  you had it the whole time."
"JESS: No idea what you're talking about."
"LORELAI: How'd you get it?"
"JESS: I didn't get anything."
"LORELAI: What, did you break into our house, you got all dressed in black and pulled a Mission: Impossible?"
"JESS: Actually, I came down the chimney and pulled a Santa Claus."
"LORELAI: Very funny."
"JESS: Thought a ridiculous accusation deserved a ridiculous response."
"LORELAI: So it's just a great big ol' coincidence that I catch you coming out of Rory's room a half an hour before she mysteriously finds the bracelet under her bed?"
"JESS: Guess so."
"LORELAI: Why would you do this?"
"JESS: I gotta go."
"LORELAI: I mean, I know you hate the world, but I thought you liked Rory."
"JESS: I didn't do anything."
"LORELAI: Bull."
"JESS: Whatever."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't whatever me, you little jerk. You let Rory run around completely panicked, thinking she lost her boyfriend's bracelet. She was miserable, do you understand that?"
"JESS: I didn't take it."
"LORELAI: I'm sure you're jealous of Dean because he's great and Rory's madly in love with him, but you taking the bracelet didn't hurt Dean, it hurt Rory. That bracelet is the most precious thing she owns. She never takes it off. It means everything to her. And you stealing it was unbelievably cruel."
"JESS: The most precious thing she owns?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"JESS: If it's the most precious thing she owns, why did it take her two weeks to figure out it was gone, huh? You might wanna reevaluate how madly in love she is. I wouldn't start calling him son yet."
"LORELAI: Get outta here."
"JESS: You read my mind."
"CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks in and sits down on the couch. There's a knock on the front door, Lorelai answers it]"
"LUKE: I just spent a hundred thousand dollars and it's all your fault!"
"LORELAI: Oh, good."
"[They walk into the kitchen]"
"LUKE: I ran into Taylor at the market, and I found out he owns the building that apartment was in."
"LORELAI: No way."
"LUKE: That and several others all over town."
"LORELAI: That is so weird."
"LUKE: He's systematically buying up the town. He's gonna turn it into Taylorville where everyone'll wear cardigans and have the same grass height."
"LORELAI: Luke, do you wanna sit down?"
"LUKE: And then he told me he's gonna buy the building next to the diner, turn it into a plate shop for freaks who don't have enough brain power to collect stamps. I lost it."
"LORELAI: Uh, I can't picture that."
"LUKE: I walked around in a blind rage. I was crazy. I bought one of those Belgian waffles with the ice cream dipped in chocolate."
"LORELAI: You ate that?"
"LUKE: No, I didn't eat it!"
"LORELAI: Of course not."
"LUKE: I'm upset, not suicidal."
"LORELAI: Right."
"LUKE: I knew I just had to do something, and I had your voice going round and round in my head."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's kinda like the Small World song."
"LUKE: Take a chance, Luke. Make a move, Luke. Can't have a single bed, Luke. So I bought the building!"
"LORELAI: You  you what?"
"LUKE: I went to the bank and got a cashier's check, signed the papers and I bought the building."
"LORELAI: Wow"
"LUKE: I am the building's owner."
"LORELAI: I heard."
"LUKE: I own the building."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, don't worry, maybe you can still get out of it. You can go back and tell them you lost your mind."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Or I bet you can sell it to Taylor."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: So, relax, you can still get out of this."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Unless you don't wanna get out of it."
"LUKE: Oh no, I wanna get out of this. Uh, why would I not wanna get out of this?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, owning that building gives you some options."
"LUKE: Like?"
"LORELAI: Uh, like you could expand Luke's if you wanted to."
"LUKE: Yah."
"LORELAI: Or you could rent it to someone else."
"LUKE: Yah."
"LORELAI: Someone else who might drive Taylor crazy."
"LUKE: Maybe I should think about this."
"LORELAI: Sure, sleep on it."
"LUKE: Sleep on it, right, right."
"LORELAI: You want some tea?"
"LUKE: Tea's good, sure."
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, um, does Jess ever talk to you about Rory?"
"LUKE: Uh, what do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. They just. . .they seem to be thrown together quite a lot lately and I was just trying to figure out if that's a coincidence or - ."
"LUKE: Or if there's something going on."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"LUKE: Jess doesn't exactly confide in me."
"LORELAI: Right."
"LUKE: Of course, if there was something going on, I think that'd be really great."
"LORELAI: You do?"
"LUKE: Yeah. Rory's a great kid, she'd be really good for Jess."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, she would."
"LUKE: You really think there might be something going on?"
"LORELAI: I don't know"
"LUKE: Boy, that would be great."
"LORELAI: Yeah, great."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Jess is reading and listening to music as Luke walks in and takes a sledgehammer out of the closet. He walks across the room and swings the sledgehammer through the wall, then hands it to Jess.]"
"LUKE: That's your room. Finish up. We'll hold hands and skip afterwards."

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke's apartment is under construction. Luke delivers food to some customers, a chunk of the ceiling falls onto the table.]"
"LUKE: Here you go. Geez, uh, sorry folks. Uh, here. . .there we go. Free coffee all around. You might wanna put your hand over that. There we go. [walks over to construction worker] Tom, what the hell is going on up there?"
"TOM: We're redoing your apartment. What do you think is going on up there?"
"LUKE: The ceiling's falling in. I've got customers eating drywall here."
"TOM: Oh, well, that can't be good."
"LUKE: You said minimal disruptions."
"TOM: Hey, this is minimal disruptions. Look, I need you to sign this change order."
"LUKE: What happened now?"
"TOM: Well, we broke through this wall and we found some pipes that shouldn't be there. We gotta move them."
"LUKE: Move them where?"
"TOM: Not sure. We gotta find out what they do first."
"LUKE: You're kidding?"
"TOM: Oh yeah. There's nothing I like more than a good moving a pipe' joke."
"LUKE: Fine, one more week, that's it."
"TOM: Oh, sure, construction ultimatum. Ha, that's even funnier than my moving pipe joke."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Geez, look at this place."
"RORY: It's a mess."
"LORELAI: How long  ."
"LUKE: Nope  can't sit here."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"LUKE: Three people got nailed in the head here earlier."
"LORELAI: But their food was okay, right?"
"LUKE: Will you just move? [Lorelai's cell phone rings] Outside."
"LORELAI: You know, if I sit here one more second, I just might be outside. Order me some coffee."
"[Lorelai walks away; Jess walks over to the table and hands Rory an open umbrella]"
"LUKE: Oh, you are really funny. You and Tom should put an act together. I'd leave it open."
"[cut to outside]"
"LORELAI: Go ahead Mom, I can hear you now."
"EMILY: I wanted to know if you'd like a gift certificate for a weekend at the Birch Grove Spa."
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"EMILY: I bid on it at the DAR Symphony Fundraiser and I won."
"LORELAI: Birch Grove? That's supposed to be an amazing place, why don't you go?"
"EMILY: Oh, I've never had any real desire to go to a spa."
"LORELAI: Why'd you bid on it then?"
"EMILY: It was for charity, I had to bid on something. And I certainly didn't want another portrait of George Washington. I've got four in the attic already."
"LORELAI: Well, I'd love it."
"EMILY: Good."
"LORELAI: Two days of total mind-numbing pampering. Massages, facials, aromatherapy."
"EMILY: My goodness, you make it sound like heaven."
"LORELAI: It's as close as you'll ever come to being a dog."
"EMILY: I beg your pardon?"
"LORELAI: You know, a whole life of nothing but eating, sleeping, lying on your back and getting rubbed."
"EMILY: I'd love the comparison to stop there."
"LORELAI: Deal. Um, hey, when's it for?"
"EMILY: This weekend, actually."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I'll be there."
"EMILY: So will I."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: Well, the certificate is for two, and since you make it sound like the most wonderful place in the world, I might as well try it with you."
"LORELAI: Oh, but - ."
"EMILY: That's all right, isn't it, if I join you? You don't mind?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't mind at all."
"EMILY: Wonderful. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. You know, I'm actually looking forward to this."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, me too. Thanks Mom. Buh bye."
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S"
"[Rory is sitting at the table holding the umbrella over her head. Lorelai walks in and sits down]"
"LORELAI: I'm going to a spa with my mother."
"RORY: Lean forward."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the bed as Rory walks around packing a suitcase]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] So, then we're all confirmed. Uh, great. Thanks so much for your help. Okay, bye. [hangs up] Yeeessss!"
"RORY: That was an evil yes."
"LORELAI: Not an evil yes. It's a yes, I'm pretty, but hello, I'm smart' kind of a yes."
"RORY: Oh, my mistake."
"LORELAI: So here's the deal  I go into my facial just as my mother is finishing her salt glow, which will end ten minutes after I've hit my scalp treatment which puts me in the watsu massage pool at least six minutes into her back facial. Uh, in fact, the day is so well planned, I won't see her until dinner which will be cut tragically short by the food poisoning I plan to contract."
"RORY: You are twelve and disgusting."
"LORELAI: I am trapped and desperate."
"RORY: You really think you can avoid Grandma the entire weekend?"
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm nothing if not a great organizer. Now, let's talk about what you're gonna do tonight. Throwing a party, I hope? Inviting hundreds of bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?"
"RORY: I am going to do laundry, watch TV, order Indian food and go to bed early."
"LORELAI: And then come the bikers and lowlifes who are gonna trash the place?"
"RORY: I may even fall asleep on the couch with the TV on."
"LORELAI: When do the bikers and lowlifes get to trash the place?"
"RORY: You're all packed."
"LORELAI: Rory, you have to do something bad when Mommy's out of town. It's the law. You're seen Risky Business, right? Now I'm not asking for a prostitution ring, but how about a floating craps game or something?"
"RORY: I'll see what I can do."
"LORELAI: I would greatly appreciate it."
"[a car honks from outside]"
"RORY: I think Grandma's here."
"LORELAI: What's she honking for? She hates honking. She calls it a mechanical bodily function. [looks out window] Ugh, geez."
"RORY: [looks out window] Oh, cool!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Emily is standing in front of a limousine as Rory and Lorelai walk out of the house]"
"EMILY: Hello, hello, hello!"
"LORELAI: What, are we going to the prom?"
"EMILY: I just thought since this weekend is all about relaxing, we should start with the ride."
"RORY: This is cool, Grandma."
"EMILY: Thank you, Rory. So, are we all ready to go?"
"LORELAI: I guess so, Miss Daisy. Bye sweets."
"RORY: Bye. Bye Grandma."
"EMILY: Goodbye Rory."
"RORY: Have a good time."
"LORELAI: Bikers and lowlifes."
"RORY: I'll get right on it."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"TEACHER: In general, the lab reports weren't bad  but they weren't great either, which leads me to question whether everyone has the grasp of electrochemistry I prefer before we move on. To that end, I will be giving another test on Tuesday covering chapters fourteen through eighteen in your textbooks, as well as the material from lab. Now please proceed with the assignment we all started yesterday, as that too will be included on the test."
"PARIS: Madeline?"
"MADELINE: What?"
"PARIS: What are you guys doing tonight?"
"MADELINE: It's Friday night."
"PARIS: So you've got dates?"
"MADELINE: Well, yeah, why?"
"PARIS: I was kind of hoping you could study with me."
"MADELINE: On a Friday night?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"MADELINE: But we've got dates."
"LOUISE: What is she saying?"
"MADELINE: She wants us to study with her."
"LOUISE: On a Friday night?"
"MADELINE: Yeah."
"LOUISE: But we've got dates."
"PARIS: I know you have dates, I was hoping maybe you'd cancel them."
"MADELINE: To study?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"MADELINE: On a Friday night?"
"LOUISE: What'd she say?"
"MADELINE: She wants us to cancel our dates to study."
"LOUISE: On a Friday night?"
"MADELINE: That's what she said."
"LOUISE: But we have - ."
"PARIS: Oh my God, forget it! [walks over to Rory] So, I suppose that you have big Friday night plans also?"
"RORY: Well, kind of."
"PARIS: So the fact that I'm seeing my entire Harvard career slip away apparently is of no interest to anyone?"
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"PARIS: I got an A-minus, okay?"
"RORY: So?"
"PARIS: What do you mean, so? I got an A-minus. I have never gotten an A-minus. I just can't focus lately. Things are so weird at my house. My dad finally figured out exactly how much it was gonna cost him to divorce my mom, so now he's back and it's bad enough that I wasted all that time crunching the numbers with him, but now that he's back, they're fighting and redecorating. The place is a mess. I need help."
"RORY: Look, I can't tonight, but if you're still freaked out after the quiz on Tuesday, I will spend everyday next week helping you prepare for the final, okay?"
"PARIS: I guess."
"RORY: Relax. It will be fine, I promise."
"PARIS: All I had to do was move a decimal point and none of this would've happened."
"CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA"
"[Emily and Lorelai walk into the lobby]"
"EMILY: Oh, look at this place. It's lovely. And that smell  what is that, eucalyptus?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"EMILY: Well, it's lovely. Oh Lorelai, come over here, look. They have cucumber slices in the water."
"LORELAI: Oh wow! Now if they have ranch dressing in the soap dispensers, this place is great."
"EMILY: You know what? I love it here."
"LORELAI: Hm. Careful Mom, that's how they get you in the Moonies."
"EMILY: I feel more relaxed already. Mm, that's the most delicious water I've ever had. Have a sip."
"LORELAI: Let's just check in, shall we?"
"EMILY: Okay. [they walk to the front desk] Hello, I'm Emily Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai."
"BOBBY: Ah, yes, welcome to Birch Grove. My name is Bobby. I have everything all set for you. Do you have luggage?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it's in the Luca Brasi mobile out front."
"BOBBY: Okay, well, we can take care of that for you. Here are your room keys and a copy of all of your spa activities. You ladies are booked solid, I see."
"EMILY: Well, we intend to leave here completely different people."
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm going to be Ted Nugent."
"BOBBY: Anyhow, your rooms are right down this hall. Fruit and yogurt is served by the pool in the mornings, and your lunch and dinner seatings are on that itinerary. Any questions?"
"LORELAI: Yes, where can one get a cup of coffee around here?"
"BOBBY: Ah, we don't serve anything with caffeine here."
"LORELAI: And you think that's safe?"
"EMILY: Thank you, Bobby. We're sure we're going to have a wonderful time."
"LORELAI: Mom, there's no coffee."
"EMILY: It won't k*ll you to go two days without coffee, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: No, I think it will."
"EMILY: Lorelai, just focus on all the pampering we're going to have. Look at all the wonderful things we have to look forward to."
"LORELAI: Oh no."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Oh, um, I'll be right back. They screwed up our appointments."
"EMILY: Again?"
"LORELAI: What do you mean, again?"
"EMILY: Well, on the way to your house I called to confirm our schedule and found out they had us booked separately for every single one of our treatments. Luckily, I insisted on speaking to a manager and was able to straighten everything out. Yes, those are right."
"LORELAI: They are?"
"EMILY: I even had them move the pedicure tubs together in the same room so we can talk during it."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm really gonna need a cup of coffee."
"EMILY: Have some cucumber water."
"LORELAI: No, see, that's not gonna do it because it's  ."
"EMILY: Drink, Lorelai."
"LORELAI:  cucumber water. Yuck."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Rory and Dean are kissing by a tree]"
"RORY: Wow, your lung capacity certainly has improved."
"DEAN: Well, I've been playing a lot more basketball lately."
"RORY: Yet another reason to continue the fight to keep physical education in schools."
"DEAN: So, tonight."
"RORY: Yes?"
"DEAN: I was thinking."
"RORY: Yes?"
"DEAN: Since your mother's gonna be gone."
"RORY: Mm hmm."
"DEAN: Maybe I'd come over."
"RORY: Oh."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: Actually, I was thinking of pulling kind of a hermit thing tonight."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: I don't know. J.D. Salinger seems to dig it."
"DEAN: You don't want me to come over?"
"RORY: No, I just. . .I almost never get the house all to myself and I thought with my mom gone, I can finally do my laundry exactly the way I like it. You know, not just separated into whites and colors, but the colors separated into darks, mediums, and lights, with a separate pile for white T-shirts and T-shirts with some kind of writing on them, like, you know, Rock Star, Evil, or Kafka was here."
"DEAN: You wanna be alone to do laundry?"
"RORY: And watch TV and eat the Indian food that I love but my mom hates the smell of and go to bed early and. . .are you mad?"
"DEAN: Why would I be mad? You wanna spend tonight alone."
"RORY: But hey, tomorrow, the whole day is all about you. I mean it, from morning til night. You plan it, or I'll plan it, or we can get a professional to plan it, whatever you want. Just don't be mad."
"DEAN: I'm not. I'm not mad."
"RORY: Good."
"DEAN: I'm confused, but I'm not mad."
"RORY: Fine"
"DEAN: I'm a saint, but I'm not mad."
"RORY: Thank you."
"DEAN: You're welcome."
"RORY: So, deep breath and. . ."
"CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA"
"[Lorelai is in her room unpacking. She hears knocking and opens the door to the hallway. No one's there, so she opens another door. Emily walks in wearing a bathrobe.]"
"EMILY: How do I look?"
"LORELAI: Like a landlady. What is this?"
"EMILY: I got adjoining rooms so we don't have to go out in the hallway to get to each other."
"LORELAI: Great thinking!"
"EMILY: God, this robe is fabulous. How do they get it so soft?"
"LORELAI: Well, I think having about forty other people wear it first is part of the secret."
"EMILY: Oh, stop it. So are you all ready for our skin rejuvenating and revitalizing collagen facial and eye treatment?"
"LORELAI: Almost."
"EMILY: It has vitamin C and plant extracts in it, which is the hottest thing in skin care these days. And the eye treatment is supposed to reduce puffiness and minimize the appearance of fine lines."
"LORELAI: Okay, no more brochures for you. All right, I'm ready, let's go."
"EMILY: Aren't you gonna wear your robe?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Your robe, you're supposed to wear your robe."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I'm sure they'll give me one when I get there."
"EMILY: But these robes are wonderful."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: They help you relax."
"LORELAI: We're late, Mom."
"EMILY: They're wonderful, relaxing robes."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"EMILY: And yet, you stand there like it's some badge of honor not to put on your robe like everyone else in this place. [Lorelai goes into the bathroom to change] This isn't for me, you know, it's for you. I already have on my robe. I'm already relaxed. What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: [from bathroom] You're kidding me, right?"
"EMILY: Well, hurry up, we're gonna be late."
"LORELAI: [opens bathroom door] Happy?"
"EMILY: Apparently you didn't see the matching slippers."
"CUT TO FACIAL ROOM"
"FACIALIST: So, how are we doing?"
"LORELAI: So good."
"FACIALIST: Okay. Well, I'm gonna leave you to sit for a few minutes, so just relax and enjoy, and I'll be right back."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"[As the facialist leaves, Lorelai closes her eyes. Emily quietly enters the room and sits down next to Lorelai.]"
"EMILY: Are your feet sweating?"
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"EMILY: Those booties make my feet sweat. Don't they make your feet sweat?"
"LORELAI: What are you doing in my room?"
"EMILY: Magda left me sitting for twenty minutes. Fine time to take a coffee break."
"LORELAI: She's not taking a coffee break. Your skin is supposed to be absorbing the moisture in your mask  in your room."
"EMILY: Let's see what's next on our agenda, shall we? Stop moving Lorelai, you'll electrocute yourself. Ooh, the Egyptian mud bath. I wonder if the mud bath is one of those things you see in brochures where they wrap you in towels like you're in a cocoon of some sort. That might be nice. Especially if their towels are as good as their robes because I just love these robes. I wonder where they get these robes. Shouldn't be so hard to find the manufacturer. I could order a few of them. One for me, one for you and one for Rory."
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Emily walk down the hallway in their robes]"
"EMILY: I still can't get over it, it really was mud. I mean, I know it said mud bath but I didn't really think they meant a real mud bath. And the odd thing is I should've been more repulsed by it. Sitting in a tub of hot dirt, which is basically what mud is, should've made me ill, and yet I really enjoyed it. Did yours have twigs? Mine had twigs, and when I asked the woman about them, she told me they were there because of the healing qualities. . ."
"[they walk through a door marked Quiet Room.' A few seconds later, the door opens and Lorelai ushers Emily out into the hall]"
"EMILY: What are you doing? Lorelai, stop it! You're pushing me!"
"[Lorelai bangs on the door, showing Emily the Quiet Room' sign, then they walk back into the room]"
"CUT TO MASSAGE ROOM"
"[Lorelai and Emily are both getting massages.]"
"MASSEUR: How's the pressure  too much?"
"LORELAI: Yup."
"MASSEUR: Sorry, I'll go lighter."
"EMILY: Your hands are amazing. Compliment your masseur's hands, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"EMILY: You were muttering under your breath. Years of experience have taught me that when you do that, it's usually about me."
"LORELAI: Mom, you signed us up for a couple's massage."
"EMILY: So?"
"LORELAI: A couple's massage is for a couple  not a couple of people."
"EMILY: It's more efficient this way. We'll both be finished at the same time."
"LORELAI: Mom, do you know what most people who get these massages do about five minutes after it's over? They have sex, together, probably while wearing their robes."
"EMILY: Could the two of you excuse us for a moment please? Thank you. [the masseurs leave] Well, that was appalling!"
"LORELAI: Well, that was true!"
"EMILY: You're just determined to spoil this, aren't you, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Why, because I want a quiet, private massage?"
"EMILY: You've been pouting and sulking and sighing."
"LORELAI: Oh, I have not been sighing."
"EMILY: Rolling your eyes, mumbling."
"LORELAI: Well, that's how I detox."
"EMILY: Ever since we got here, you've made it your mission to be as miserable as possible."
"LORELAI: That's not true."
"EMILY: It's completely true. And if you don't care that you're hurting my feelings, maybe you care that you're wasting all your relaxing time acting like a petulant four-year-old."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Do you want me to try to get myself another room?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: I saw a supply closet down the hall. Maybe my masseur could finish me in there."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom."
"EMILY: Or perhaps I could just roll myself against a stucco wall, eliminate the need for a masseur altogether."
"LORELAI: Lie down Mom, please."
"EMILY: If you say so. Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yes, Mom?"
"EMILY: Would you go get the boys, please?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory, while on the phone, is sitting on the living room floor surrounded by piles of clothes]"
"RORY: No, that's two orders of garlic gnon, three simosas, and a chicken vindiloo. And rice, and the green sauce, and no salad, and. . . oh wait, sorry. Can you hold on a sec? [answers the call waiting] Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hi, this is Phil's Liquor. I'm supposed to be delivering a keg there tonight."
"RORY: Hold on. [switches to other call] Hi, sorry. Yeah, that's it. Forty minutes, great. Bye. [switches back] Hey."
"LORELAI: Who was that?"
"RORY: Sandeep's."
"LORELAI: Oh, you're ordering the Indian food?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: Good, enjoy. Can you burn the house down afterward, cause that's the only way we'll get the smell out."
"RORY: Absolutely. How's the spa?"
"LORELAI: Tranquil."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: I wasn't done. Tranquilizers, uh, will be required if I have to spend one more minute with my mother."
"RORY: Please tell me you're at least trying to get along with her?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, I'm being a peach."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Well, I smell like a peach. Was that the doorbell?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'll call you later."
"LORELAI: Oh wait, I wanna find out who it is."
"RORY: The sooner you get back to your weekend, the sooner it'll be over."
"LORELAI: Okay, but before you go, can you get out my address book and count how many friends I have? I'll wait."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Mean!"
"RORY: Steal me soap! [hangs up the phone, then opens the front door] Paris. What -."
"PARIS: I tried to stay home and study myself but I can't. I don't know what anything means anymore. I mean, I can't even read my own handwriting. What does this say? The person who wrote this should be dressed in a clown suit stuffing bodies under their porch. You're in your pajamas."
"RORY: I know."
"PARIS: This was the big night you had planned  a rendezvous with Mr. Peanut?"
"RORY: Well..."
"PARIS: You're doing laundry."
"RORY: Yes."
"PARIS: You're doing laundry in your pajamas."
"RORY: My mom is out of town and I never get the house all to myself."
"PARIS: You mean you never get to go months on end without seeing your parents, just getting an occasional postcard that doesn't even have a courtesy ""Wish you were here"" written on it? That does suck. Don't let me stand in your way."
"RORY: Paris, wait."
"PARIS: No, forget it, I don't want to get in the way of your big night. I hear there's gonna be some hot knitting going on later."
"RORY: Fine, I'll study with you."
"PARIS: You will?"
"RORY: For one hour, that's it. We can do a quick review and a pop quiz and then you are going home. Deal?"
"PARIS: Deal."
"RORY: Okay, so, go sit on the couch. I'll be out in the minute."
"PARIS: Where are you going?"
"RORY: I'm going to go change."
"PARIS: Okay, but my hour doesn't start until you get back out here, right?"
"CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA"
"[Emily walks into Lorelai's room]"
"EMILY: Are you ready?"
"LORELAI: Wow, you look great, Mom."
"EMILY: Are you being sarcastic?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm being completely serious."
"EMILY: Oh, well, thank you. That's a pretty color. What is that?"
"LORELAI: It's called Vicious Trollop."
"EMILY: Oh, stop it! Now why would you name a lipstick something like that?"
"LORELAI: Cause dirty whore' was taken?"
"EMILY: You frighten me."
"LORELAI: You wanna try some?"
"EMILY: No, thank you."
"LORELAI: Go on, Mom, try it."
"EMILY: It won't look good on me."
"LORELAI: Sure it will."
"EMILY: Well, all right, but if I look ridiculous. . ."
"LORELAI: I'll be the first one to point it out. You're a vicious trollop, you're a vicious trollop."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"EMILY: Well?"
"LORELAI: I like it."
"EMILY: You do? I like it too."
"LORELAI: Good, let's go then, I'm starving."
"EMILY: Oh, me too. What are they serving for dinner tonight?"
"LORELAI: Well, let's see. [looks at menu] Hmm."
"EMILY: They certainly do like their tofu here, don't they?"
"LORELAI: And the word steamed. Well, they have dessert at least. Cookies sweetened with sprouted mungbean."
"EMILY: That sounds dreadful."
"LORELAI: Yes, it does."
"EMILY: Where are you going? You aren't going to change, are you? Our seating's in ten minutes."
"LORELAI: Get your coat."
"EMILY: I don't need a coat to go to the dining room."
"LORELAI: We're not going to the dining room."
"EMILY: Well, where are we going?"
"LORELAI: Out."
"EMILY: Out where?"
"LORELAI: We're gonna leave the spa, find a restaurant, and have a steak."
"EMILY: A steak?"
"LORELAI: Who's gonna stop us?"
"EMILY: A steak."
"LORELAI: Come on, Mom. What's it gonna be  vicious trollop or the wide world of mungbeans?"
"EMILY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: I'm right behind you."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory and Paris are studying in the living room]"
"RORY: So, given that those are the reactions occurring in the two half-cells, what do you do next?"
"PARIS: Well, if we add them together, doubling the coefficients of the silver half equation but not the voltage, we get the equation for the complete reaction."
"RORY: Well, you're in much better shape than you wanna think you are."
"PARIS: Impossible. [doorbell rings; Rory walks toward the door] Where are you going?"
"RORY: That's my food."
"PARIS: Another half hour, please!"
"RORY: No, you got your hour. You need to go."
"PARIS: But  ."
"RORY: Go!"
"PARIS: Fine."
"[Rory opens the door. Jess is holding a box of food]"
"JESS: Delivery."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"JESS: Well, Luke figured since you're along tonight that maybe you wouldn't have any food in the house, so he sent over a care package."
"RORY: I don't need a care package. I ordered food from Sandeep's."
"JESS: Really? Planning on burning down the house afterwards?"
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: The only way to k*ll the smell. Where should I put this? [walks into house]"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"JESS: Kitchen?"
"RORY: Um. . .sure."
"[cut to kitchen]"
"RORY: God, how much food is in there? This could feed twelve."
"JESS: Excuse me, I've seen you eat."
"RORY: Fine, six."
"JESS: Yeah, well, he wanted you taken care of. He wasn't sure how long your mom was gonna be gone for."
"RORY: Just tonight."
"JESS: Oh, he didn't know that."
"RORY: Well, now you can tell him."
"JESS: I will."
"RORY: So how come Caesar didn't bring this over?"
"JESS: I volunteered."
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Just wanted to get out of the construction zone. There's nothing but banging and yelling. That place gives me a headache."
"RORY: Oh."
"JESS: Why  did you think I wanted to come over here and see you?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Just needed some quiet."
"RORY: Fine."
"JESS: That is all."
"RORY: Got it."
"JESS: Clear my head."
"RORY: I understand."
"JESS: So, aren't you gonna eat?"
"RORY: Eventually."
"JESS: It gets cold fast."
"RORY: I can heat it up."
"JESS: Reheated French fries really suck."
"RORY: Hm, they do suck."
"JESS: Yeah, so, eat."
"RORY: Okay, I will. You're still standing there."
"JESS: I know. You didn't give me a tip."
"RORY: You want money?"
"JESS: No, I'll take a fry though."
"RORY: Okay, yeah, have as much as you want."
"JESS: Okay, great. [takes off jacket]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"JESS: Getting ready to eat."
"RORY: You're staying?"
"JESS: Didn't you just invite me?"
"RORY: No, I -."
"JESS: No, you told me to have all I wanted. That sounded invitation-like."
"RORY: You wanna stay here and eat?"
"JESS: b*at being at Luke's."
"RORY: But  ."
"PARIS: [walks in from living room] I can't find my flashcards."
"JESS: I didn't know you had company."
"RORY: This is Paris. We were just studying."
"JESS: Huh."
"PARIS: Don't worry, I was just leaving. If you find my flashcards, call me, okay?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Stay for dinner."
"PARIS: But I thought. . ."
"RORY: We have a ton of food, and we can go over the notes more later."
"PARIS: You're sure?"
"RORY: Positive."
"PARIS: Is that mac and cheese?"
"RORY: It sure is."
"PARIS: I love mac and cheese."
"RORY: Great."
"PARIS: I'm not allowed to have mac and cheese."
"RORY: Splurge. Come on Paris, stay."
"PARIS: Do you have a twenty-four hour pharmacy just in case I have an allergic reaction to something?"
"RORY: Believe it or not, we do."
"PARIS: Okay, can I borrow your phone?"
"RORY: It's by the door."
"[Paris walks away]"
"JESS: Interesting."
"RORY: What is?"
"JESS: You think we need a chaperone?"
"RORY: No, I don't."
"JESS: You just invited one."
"RORY: I'm just being polite. Paris is alone tonight and you yourself just said we have enough food for six."
"JESS: With me around, it's down to four."
"RORY: With Paris around, it's down to two."
"JESS: Works out well."
"RORY: I think so."
"PARIS: [on phone] Hola, es Paris. Voy a comer la cena de cas de Rory. Hay mucho mac and cheese!"
"CUT TO RESTAURANT"
"[Emily and Lorelai check their coats, then walk toward the hostess]"
"EMILY: My goodness, look at this place."
"LORELAI: I bet there's no cucumber slices in the water here. [to hostess] Hi there, party of two."
"HOSTESS: Okay. Uh, well, I can take your name, but I probably won't have a table for about an hour."
"LORELAI: An hour!"
"EMILY: I can't wait an hour."
"LORELAI: Me either."
"EMILY: I'll pass out."
"LORELAI: Go first, you can break my fall."
"EMILY: Can we bribe you?"
"HOSTESS: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Please? She's loaded."
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"HOSTESS: You know, a couple of stools just opened up at the bar, and we do serve our entire menu there."
"LORELAI: That is a great idea. Thanks. Come on."
"EMILY: We cannot eat dinner at a bar."
"LORELAI: I don't wanna wait an hour, and I'm wearing the wrong shoes for a drive thru."
"EMILY: But what are people going to think?"
"LORELAI: That we're loose women with questionable morals."
"[they sit down at the bar]"
"EMILY: Doesn't seem right to eat dinner when your feet aren't touching the floor."
"BARTENDER: What can I get you ladies?"
"LORELAI: Hi Steve, nice to meet you. We will have two. . .martinis?"
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Two vodka martinis, straight up with a twist, very dry, very cold, and a couple of menus, please."
"EMILY: And some peanuts."
"LORELAI: Ah, peanuts, good idea."
"BARTENDER: Here you go, I'll get your drinks."
"LORELAI: Thank you. You're a good man, Steve. Okay, I'm thinking steak and Caesar salad if it's not too anchovy-y, and hey  do you wanna split a shrimp cocktail to start?"
"EMILY: That sounds fine."
"LORELAI: Ah, I just love the idea of shrimp cocktail with a steak dinner, you know? It's so Casino, Big Joe, steak and shrimp  hey, save some for winter, there."
"EMILY: I never realized how wonderful peanuts were before."
"BARTENDER: Want a refill?"
"EMILY: Oh, yes, please."
"LORELAI: Cheers, Mom."
"EMILY: Cheers. I must tell you, I never expected this."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Me inhaling peanuts at a singles bar."
"LORELAI: This isn't a singles bar, Mom. It's a sixty-forty bar."
"EMILY: A what?"
"LORELAI: Sixty-year-old men hitting on forty-year-old women, divorcees mostly."
"EMILY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Look around."
"EMILY: Hm. Oh, now, she can do better than that. What does she see in him?"
"LORELAI: Big will, short life span, the usual draw. Hey Mom."
"EMILY: I wonder if they have pretzels, too."
"LORELAI: Don't look now, but I think you're passing for a forty-year-old woman."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Two o'clock, silver fox, totally checking you out."
"EMILY: Oh, he is not."
"LORELAI: Well, he's not staring at Steve."
"EMILY: You're being ridiculous. He's definitely not looking at me."
"LORELAI: He's still looking."
"EMILY: Drink your martini, Lorelai."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory, Paris, and Jess are eating at the kitchen table]"
"PARIS: A tragic waste of paper."
"JESS: I can't believe you just said that."
"PARIS: Well, it's true, the b*at's writing was completely self-indulgent. I have one word for Jack Kerouac  edit."
"JESS: It was not self-indulgent. The b*at believed in shocking people, stirring things up."
"PARIS: They believed in drugs, booze, and petty crime."
"RORY: Well, then you can say that they exposed you to a world you wouldn't have otherwise known. Isn't that what great writing's all about?"
"PARIS: That was not great writing. That was the National Enquirer of the fifties."
"JESS: You're cracked."
"PARIS: Typical guy response. Worship Kerouac and Bukowski, God forbid you'd pick up anything by Jane Austen."
"JESS: Hey, I've read Jane Austen."
"PARIS: You have?"
"JESS: Yeah, and I think she would've liked Bukowski."
"PARIS: What are you doing?"
"JESS: Salt and pepper dip. Only way to eat a fry."
"PARIS: Really?"
"RORY: It's fast food gospel."
"PARIS: Mm. That's good. That's really, really good."
"[phone rings]"
"JESS: You like hot sauce?"
"PARIS: I don't know. Should I?"
"JESS: I think it's wise."
"RORY: [answers phone] Hello?"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Oh, hey. Where are you?"
"DEAN: On my way to see you  if that's okay?"
"RORY: Oh, well -"
"DEAN: I know you wanna be alone, so I'll only stay a minute. I just wanna say hi."
"RORY: We just said hi."
"DEAN: Well, I wanna say hi a little closer."
"RORY: But, I'm a mess, really. It's not pretty. You won't recognize me."
"DEAN: Well, then put a name tag on cause I miss you."
"RORY: I miss you too, but "
"DEAN: But what?"
"RORY: But. . .Paris is here."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: She freaked out about a grade and she wanted to go over some notes, and you know Paris  she will not be denied."
"DEAN: Okay, then I'm not really ruining your alone night, someone else did that."
"RORY: Yes, but "
"DEAN: I'll see you in a sec. [hangs up]"
"JESS: I can't get into poetry. It's kind of like, geez, just say it already, we're dying here."
"RORY: Wow, you know, I just noticed the time, and it's getting really late."
"JESS: It's seven o'clock."
"RORY: I know, but Paris and I still have a lot more studying to do. Jess, please thank Luke for me. It was really nice of him."
"JESS: Who was on the phone?"
"RORY: No one."
"JESS: No one wouldn't happen to be heading over here now, would he?"
"RORY: Jess."
"PARIS: What's going on?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"JESS: Dean's on his way over and Rory doesn't want him to find me here."
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Yeah, why?"
"RORY: You know why."
"JESS: We're just eating dinner."
"RORY: Jess, I'm asking you as a friend, just please leave now."
"JESS: You really want me to go?"
"RORY: I really wanna avoid a fight with Dean."
"JESS: Okay, I'm going."
"RORY: Thank you."
"JESS: Ow!"
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: Ooh! I just twisted my ankle. I better go lie down."
"RORY: Jess!"
"JESS: God, you're no fun when you're tense. Are you sure you want me to go? Cause maybe this whole thing can be solved between me and Dean if we just sat down and had a little heart to heart. He can tell me his issues, I'll tell him mine."
"RORY: Jess!"
"JESS: I promise I'll speak slowly."
"RORY: Bye! [pushes him out the front door]"
"JESS: Okay, well, give him my best, would ya? [sees Dean in the front yard] Actually, I guess I could do that myself."
"RORY: Dean, Jess just came by to bring me some food."
"JESS: From Luke's."
"RORY: He wanted to make sure I ate."
"JESS: Luke did."
"RORY: Right, Luke did."
"JESS: Personally, I could care less if she eats."
"RORY: Yeah, true, he could care less."
"JESS: I see you brought a little something, too. Is that ice cream? That's so nice. A tiny little ice cream package just big enough for two. Hey, are you guys gonna feed each other cause that's just so darn cute. Oops. You're doing that towering over me thing. Huh. I tell you, you've really got that down. It helps that you're twelve feet tall, but this Frankenstein scowl really adds to the whole  ."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: Okay, I'm going. Look, man, I really was just dropping off some food, so don't get all West Side Story on me, okay? [leaves]"
"RORY: So, do you wanna. . . [Dean walks into the house] . . .come in?"
"[cut to kitchen]"
"DEAN: What the hell is going on?"
"PARIS: Hi."
"RORY: Dean, you remember Paris, right?"
"DEAN: Yeah, hi. So Jess just dropped this off, huh?"
"RORY: Oh, well. . ."
"DEAN: Now I know you eat fast, but this is a lot of food to put away that quickly, even on your best day."
"RORY: Okay, so he didn't just drop it off but - ."
"DEAN: You told me you were doing laundry tonight."
"RORY: I was."
"DEAN: And now you are here with Jess."
"RORY: And Paris!"
"DEAN: Jess, Rory!"
"RORY: Ah, well, I swear, I didn't "
"DEAN: You didn't what? You didn't know he was coming over?"
"RORY: I didn't."
"DEAN: And you also didn't know he was gonna stay, right?"
"RORY: It just happened."
"DEAN: How does that just happen?"
"RORY: Well, he was. . .and the diner, the diner was. . .and I. . ."
"DEAN: And you what? What? Say something!"
"RORY: Stop yelling!"
"DEAN: You totally lied to me!"
"RORY: I didn't!"
"DEAN: Turn the situation around, Rory! How's it looking?"
"RORY: It's looking complicated and I'm trying to explain it to you."
"DEAN: Ugh, that's crap."
"PARIS: It's my fault."
"DEAN: What?"
"PARIS: It's my fault that Jess was here. I saw him in the diner the day I came to Stars Hollow and I thought he was cute and since I'm not great at the whole batting the eyelashes, look at my belly shirt' kind of thing, I asked Rory to help me. I thought if she could maybe get him over here, we'd have a chance to talk and. . .I don't know, it seems totally stupid now and it obviously didn't work  shock, but that's why he was here. Thanks for trying to cover for me."
"RORY: That's okay."
"PARIS: Anyway, I should get going. I'm probably gonna break out in some sort of rash any second now. [leaves kitchen]"
"DEAN: So Paris likes Jess?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"DEAN: Rory, is this true?"
"RORY: Yes it is."
"DEAN: Paris and Jess?"
"RORY: I know. There's no explaining attraction. Dean, listen to me, if I was going to have anyone over tonight, it definitely would've been you."
"DEAN: Okay."
"RORY: Really?"
"DEAN: Well, if you say so, then I have to believe it, don't I?"
"RORY: Yes."
"DEAN: Well, okay then. I'm sorry that I yelled."
"RORY: Completely justified under the circumstances."
"DEAN: I'm gonna get going."
"RORY: No, wait, don't you wanna stay for ice cream? We could hang out."
"DEAN: Nah, I'm just gonna go."
"RORY: I'm still seeing you tomorrow, right?"
"DEAN: Yeah, sure."
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: See you tomorrow. [leaves]"
"[Rory walks into the living room]"
"RORY: What was that?"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: That, the story, the save? You helped me. Why would you do that?"
"PARIS: I don't know, it just came out."
"RORY: You have no idea what you did."
"PARIS: It was no big deal."
"RORY: No, it was a very big deal. It was a huge deal."
"PARIS: Well, you helped me tonight when you didn't want to, so I owed you."
"RORY: Thank you."
"PARIS: You're welcome. Okay, well, I'll let you get back to your alone night."
"RORY: You should stay."
"PARIS: Stay?"
"RORY: Yeah. We could hang out, maybe watch some TV. You can even spend the night if you don't wanna drive all the way back to Hartford."
"PARIS: Spend the night, like a slumber party?"
"RORY: Sort of."
"PARIS: You're just doing this because I lied to Dean for you, right?"
"RORY: I'm doing this because it's what you do with friends."
"PARIS: We're friends?"
"RORY: I'm not sure if there is an exact definition for what we are, but I do think it falls somewhere in the bizarro friends-ish realm. Come on, stay."
"PARIS: Okay. But if you're doing all this so you can freeze my bra, I'll k*ll you."
"RORY: Duly noted."
"CUT TO RESTAURANT"
"[Lorelai and Emily are eating dinner.]"
"EMILY: This is either the greatest steak I've ever eaten, or I'm so hungry, I'm delirious. Pass the horseradish, please."
"LORELAI: I never knew you were a spicy girl."
"EMILY: Oh, believe me, I can handle my heat. One summer when we were first married, your father and I stayed at this little village in Thailand where we spent two weeks eating viciously hot chilies and skinny-dipping."
"LORELAI: Ah, Mom!"
"EMILY: Well, you certainly couldn't put your clothes on after eating those things."
"LORELAI: Stop it! I like to think of parents the old fashioned way  separate bedrooms."
"FEMALE SINGER: And now it's time for my favorite part of the evening  our salute to the Chairman of the Board."
"MALE SINGER: I sure hope that's not b-o-r-e-d."
"LORELAI: Uh, uh, Mom?"
"EMILY: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Remember the man who wasn't staring at you?"
"EMILY: He wasn't staring at me."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, he's coming over."
"EMILY: What?"
"CHAD: Excuse me, I hope I'm not interrupting, but I couldn't help but notice that you two are having more fun than anyone at the bar."
"LORELAI: Well, that's true, we are."
"CHAD: Well, good, I've come to the right place. Hi, I'm Chad."
"LORELAI: Hi Chad. I'm Lorelai. This is my mother, Emily."
"CHAD: Your mother?"
"LORELAI: Chad, if the next words out of your mouth are, you can't possibly be old enough to be her mother,' I'm gonna have to cause you severe physical pain."
"CHAD: Emily, do you share this rather extreme opinion?"
"EMILY: I think I'll stay out of it."
"CHAD: In that case, let me just say that I think you look more like sisters than mother and daughter. Yeah, I went for a variation."
"LORELAI: I'll let it slide this time."
"CHAD: So, are you two, uh, local or just visiting?"
"LORELAI: Visiting. Mom's from Hartford and I'm from a town, uh "
"CHAD: Hartford? Great town, great town. A little of the old, little of the new. You like living there?"
"EMILY: Well, yes, I do."
"LORELAI: And how about you, Chad  where do you live?"
"CHAD: Here  and by here, I mean this very bar stool."
"LORELAI: Wow, admitting right off the bat that you spend your life at a bar. Do you find that people are impressed by that?"
"CHAD: Until now."
"EMILY: Oh, I love this song."
"CHAD: It's a great song for dancing."
"EMILY: Yes, it is."
"CHAD: Help me out here, will ya?"
"LORELAI: I think he's asking you to dance, Mom."
"EMILY: What? Oh, no, I, uh, I couldn't."
"CHAD: Rumor has it you love this song."
"EMILY: Oh, well, yes, but I don't dance."
"CHAD: Oh, come on. I can't believe that."
"EMILY: And I shouldn't leave my daughter alone."
"LORELAI: That's okay. The sitter'll be here any minute."
"EMILY: Really, I'm serious, you should ask someone else."
"CHAD: Is it my dancing? Because you two could work out some kind of save me' signal in case I really embarrass you."
"LORELAI: Go ahead, Mom. It'll be fun."
"CHAD: Come on, the song's almost over. You'll hardly have to spend any time at all with me."
"EMILY: All right."
"[they start dancing]"
"BARTENDER: Hey, your mom looks good out there."
"LORELAI: Yup, she sure does."
"[When the song ends, Emily starts to walk away but Chad pulls her closer for another dance. After a few seconds, Emily breaks away from him.]"
"EMILY: I'm sorry, I have to go."
"[She quickly walks over to the coat check area. Lorelai gets up and follows her]"
"LORELAI: Mom, what's wrong?"
"EMILY: We're leaving."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"EMILY: I shouldn't have been doing this."
"LORELAI: Doing what?"
"EMILY: Fraternizing with other men."
"LORELAI: Oh, what are you talking about?"
"EMILY: I practically cheated on your father."
"LORELAI: You did not cheat on Dad."
"EMILY: I danced with another man."
"LORELAI: You've danced with other men before."
"EMILY: Not like that, not without your father present."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom, it was just a dance. You were having fun."
"EMILY: I need to get out of here. How hard is it to find a coat?"
"LORELAI: Mom, you didn't do anything wrong."
"EMILY: I don't know why I let you take me to this chop house in the first place. I don't go to chop houses. What were you thinking?"
"LORELAI: Need food now."
"EMILY: And I certainly don't eat at bars. Hookers eat at bars."
"LORELAI: Only if they can't get a table."
"EMILY: You're not funny. You knew this whole evening made me uncomfortable and yet you kept pushing."
"LORELAI: I was trying to do everything right. You manipulated me into taking this trip and still I came. You told me I was acting like a teenager, so I tried to be nicer. You said you needed to eat, so I made that happen."
"EMILY: Yes, by sitting me at a bar where you practically forced me to engage in inappropriate behavior."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: You let me get sixty-fortied!"
"LORELAI: You are crazy! Do you know that? We were having dinner, Mom, a nice dinner. We were talking. Hell, we were having fun."
"EMILY: Oh, so watching your mother make an ass of herself was fun for you?"
"LORELAI: God, you know, you don't have any right to complain about this relationship if you're not willing to let your guard down once in awhile and just be normal."
"EMILY: There's a way for a mother to behave in front of her daughter. I'm sorry if you don't like it, but that's how it is."
"CUT TO BIRCH GROVE SPA"
"[Lorelai is in her room, packing. There's a knock on the door.]"
"LORELAI: Come in."
"EMILY: I called the bellman to get the bags. He said it would be around ten minutes."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: Thank you for agreeing to leave early."
"LORELAI: No problem."
"EMILY: I guess this whole thing was a silly idea anyway. I don't know why I pushed it. We can't even get through a dinner without a fight. What was I thinking putting us together for a weekend?"
"LORELAI: It was a nice thought, Mom."
"EMILY: Yes, well, I guess it's the thought that counts, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: You know, if you want, um, I can just bring our bags down. I mean, they're not that heavy, and then we don't have to wait."
"EMILY: Well, that sounds fine. Why can't we have what you and Rory have?"
"LORELAI: Rory and I are different mom."
"EMILY: We're mother and daughter, you're mother and daughter. It shouldn't be that different."
"LORELAI: It's completely different. It couldn't be more different."
"EMILY: But why?"
"LORELAI: I grew up in a different environment."
"EMILY: You mean an oppressive environment."
"LORELAI: No, Mom, I mean a different environment. And plus, I was so young when I had Rory."
"EMILY: So because I waited until I was grown and married, I can't have a relationship with my daughter?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Well, then, why?"
"LORELAI: Rory and I are best friends, Mom. We are best friends first and mother and daughter second, and you and I are mother and daughter always."
"EMILY: I wasn't taught to be best friends with my daughter."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: I was taught to be a role model for my daughter."
"LORELAI: I know that, too."
"EMILY: I did what I thought was right. I did what I thought I had to do to protect you, and because of this we have no relationship."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom, we have a relationship."
"EMILY: We do? What? What is our relationship?"
"LORELAI: Well, we. . ."
"EMILY: Exactly."
"LORELAI: Maybe an intense weekend together was not the best idea for us. Maybe we need to start with something simpler."
"EMILY: Like what, a brisk walk around the block?"
"LORELAI: No, I hate exercise."
"EMILY: Oh, well, as long as you find this amusing."
"LORELAI: Mom, come on. There has to be something else. Something small."
"EMILY: Like what? Where are you going? Lorelai, you just don't walk out on a person. That's rude. That's a robe."
"LORELAI: Yes, this is my robe. And I want you to go into your room and get your robe. And then, exactly at the same time, we are gonna shove these robes in our suitcases and we are gonna walk out that door and leave with them."
"EMILY: That's stealing."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"EMILY: You want me to steal a robe? That's how we're going to bond?"
"LORELAI: Mom, you love this robe. You've talked about nothing else except this robe since we got here, so this robe will be symbolic of our trip together."
"EMILY: But that's crazy. As soon as they check the rooms, they're going to know the robes are gone and then they're going to charge our credit card."
"LORELAI: Well, how do you know?"
"EMILY: Because that's what the little tag on the hanger says."
"LORELAI: Well, the little tag on the hanger could be right, or the little tag on the hanger could just be there trying to scare us away from trying. Either way, whether we get away with it or not, it's something we did, you and I."
"EMILY: You're serious."
"LORELAI: I am folding this robe up."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I am putting this robe in my bag."
"EMILY: That's lunacy."
"LORELAI: I am zipping up the bag that contains the robe."
"EMILY: I have a perfectly good robe at home."
"LORELAI: Now the only question is, am I doing it alone?"
"EMILY: Did you ever steal a robe with Rory?"
"LORELAI: No, Rory would never steal. She's far too moral for that. You, however, vicious trollop  what's it gonna be?"
"EMILY: I should have my head examined."
"LORELAI: We'll make an appointment when we get back."
"EMILY: You do know, in the course of one night, you've turned me into an adulterer and a thief."
"LORELAI: I'll have you working at the chicken ranch by the end of the month."
"EMILY: I cannot believe I'm doing this."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table.]"
"RORY: You actually got Grandma to steal a bathrobe?"
"LORELAI: Although I did catch her trying to return it while I was getting the car."
"RORY: Still."
"LORELAI: I know, life with my mother, one step forward, five thousand steps back. It's kinda like the spastic polka."
"KIRK: Excuse me, are you done?"
"LORELAI: No, uh, sorry, not yet."
"KIRK: So, you're gonna eat that half a piece of bacon that's been sitting there for ten minutes?"
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: I mean, of course, you must be if you're saying you're not done because that's the only thing left in front on you, unless you eat plates."
"LORELAI: Go away."
"KIRK: You are hogging the table."
"LORELAI: You keep it up, I'm ordering seconds."
"KIRK: Fine."
"LORELAI: So, Paris looked a little green this morning."
"RORY: Yeah, she had a sugar/carb hangover of monumental proportions."
"LORELAI: People don't realize it, but it takes years of training to be able to eat the way we do."
"RORY: Don't I know it."
"LORELAI: So, what's on the agenda for today?"
"RORY: Let's see. Dean, Dean, and uh. . .oh, did I mention Dean?"
"LORELAI: Wow, he must've been crazy mad last night."
"RORY: I'd say that was a fair assessment."
"LORELAI: Okay, I gotta get to the inn."
"RORY: Okay. Well, I'm probably gonna have dinner with Dean, so. . ."
"LORELAI: I'll have the house to myself tonight. Life's funny, isn't it?"
"RORY: I simply cannot stop laughing. I'll get the check."
"LORELAI: Thanks hon."
"RORY: [walks to the counter] Hey Luke."
"LUKE: What, you find a nail in your food? I swear to God, Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!"
"RORY: There's nothing wrong with the food, Luke."
"LUKE: Oh, sorry Tom."
"RORY: I just wanted to thank you."
"LUKE: Yeah, for what?"
"RORY: For the care package. It was really sweet of you."
"LUKE: What care package?"
"JESS: Hey Luke, I think they hit the water line again."
"LUKE: Oh, what? [walks away] Tom, you are dead! You hear me? Dead!"
"RORY: Huh, interesting."
"JESS: Hey, you wanna pay?"
"RORY: I don't think Luke knew anything about the food last night."
"JESS: That'll be twelve-fifty."
"RORY: Which means you lied about why you came over."
"JESS: I don't have any quarters. I'm gonna have to give you nickels."
"RORY: Now why would you lie about something like that?"
"JESS: Here's your change. Come again soon."
"RORY: You wanted to come over."
"JESS: I have to get back to work."
"RORY: You're squirming. I've never seen you squirm. It's entertaining."
"JESS: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai walks out of the diner. Dean is standing out front.]"
"LORELAI: Dean, hey."
"DEAN: Hey."
"LORELAI: Rory's just inside paying. She's coming out to meet you after."
"DEAN: Yeah, we're gonna spend the day together."
"LORELAI: That's great."
"DEAN: Yeah, it is."
"LORELAI: So, listen, Rory told me everything that happened last night. She feels just terrible about it."
"DEAN: I know."
"LORELAI: Good, you should. It's just one of those freaky unfortunate things that happens."
"DEAN: Freaky and unfortunate, yeah."
"LORELAI: She had nothing to do with Jess coming over. Believe me, she did not want him there."
"DEAN: That's what she told me. And Rory wouldn't lie, right?"
"LORELAI: No, Rory wouldn't lie."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[The phone is ringing. Lorelai rushes down the steps to answer it, but the machine picks up before she can get it.]"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so  ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message."
"EMILY: I am so tired of this ridiculous machine. I get it every time I call. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, that was close."
"EMILY: You are Rory are always out. What is it that you do? Is your house that awful you can't be in it? It's too much excitement, if you ask me. . ."
"LORELAI: Well, what isn't in Emily's rules of conduct?"
"EMILY: I don't want to talk to a machine, I'll just call you later. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: If you had your way, Mother, you'd lock us up like veal. That's what she wants, veal children."
"[phone rings again]"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so  ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message."
"EMILY: It's me again. Listen. . ."
"LORELAI: You're talking into the machine."
"EMILY: Don't forget that my DAR meeting is on Tuesday. Please. . ."
"LORELAI: It's b*rned into my brain. It's there forever."
"EMILY: . . . it's at three o'clock and all the women are all extremely punctual."
"LORELAI: When I'm senile and ga-ga and drooling into a cup, and yet I can't remember my name, I'll still remember that your DAR meeting is that Tuesday."
"EMILY: . . . this Tuesday. I'll talk to you about some other things later. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna have to be de-programmed by cult de-programmers to get that Tuesday out of my brain."
"[phone rings again]"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, we're not in, so  ah, bashed my thumb! Leave a message."
"EMILY: Your phone message is annoying. . ."
"LORELAI: Unbelievable."
"EMILY: Do you know how annoying it is?"
"LORELAI: I think I have a standard against which to measure it."
"EMILY: . . .to it yourself. Have you heard it lately?"
"LORELAI: I can't because I'm amputating my ears."
"EMILY: . . .and that thumb bashing thing, is that a joke? Why is it that your jokes are always. . ."
"LORELAI: Ah, an earless world, what a dream!"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[In the dining room, Emily is sitting at a table tasting soups as Lorelai and Sookie stand by watching.]"
"LORELAI: Haven't you already tasted that one, Mom?"
"EMILY: Mm."
"LORELAI: Twice, you've tasted that soup twice."
"EMILY: You're keeping a running count?"
"LORELAI: I'm morbidly fascinated."
"EMILY: Well, Lorelai, when you're tasting anything, the first taste acclimates the palate, the second establishes the foundation, and the third is to make your decision."
"LORELAI: Oh, there's going to be a third taste."
"EMILY: Isn't that what this is for  to taste the soups?"
"LORELAI: Taste them, yes, not to orally deduce their chemical structures."
"EMILY: Everything has to be at your pace."
"LORELAI: Or at a pace that can't be measured by the number of times the earth circles the sun."
"SOOKIE: You know, actually, I've heard that."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: One is to acclimate, two is for foundation, and three to judge."
"LORELAI: Traitor."
"EMILY: The women in my DAR group are very picky. My God, when the pate at the meeting Heddy Cubbington organized was slightly less chilled than appropriate, she was ostracized for a month."
"LORELAI: Well, that hussy Heddy had it coming."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: [to employee] Oh, gosh, they're on time for once, good. Hey, do me a favor and, uh, tell Michel that on Wednesday. . ."
"EMILY: Lorelai, please."
"LORELAI: Thanks. Um, Mom, I got a lot of other things happening here that can't come to a grinding halt for this."
"EMILY: So your full attention for a short period is too much to ask for?"
"LORELAI: Mom, I'm already giving you more attention than I would someone in these circumstances. No one else would get eight separate soups to taste for a lousy DAR. . .sorry, a not lousy DAR meeting. We only do this for weddings."
"EMILY: Well, would you like me to pay for the tasting?"
"LORELAI: No, Mom, just decide in this calendar year."
"SOOKIE: Hey, can I. . .I'm sorry. The mushroom is a great choice. It's super popular, and it's my Jackson's favorite."
"EMILY: Whose?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, my fiancé."
"EMILY: Oh, you're getting married?"
"SOOKIE: To the best man in the world."
"LORELAI: Oh hey, while we're on the subject, um, bridesmaids outfits?"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, I'm way ahead of you. I've already got a couple of ideas."
"LORELAI: Is one of them having me design and make them so I don't secretly hate what you pick and then harbor a secret grudge against you for the rest of our lives?"
"SOOKIE: It is now."
"LORELAI: I'll do it!"
"SOOKIE: We're a good team."
"MICHEL: That fellow's on the phone from the restaurant."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"MICHEL: The flannel man with the protruding ankles."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke?"
"MICHEL: I forgot his name from the desk to here, that's how memorable he is."
"LORELAI: Okay, thank you."
"EMILY: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: Oh, to talk to Luke."
"EMILY: Can't you call him back?"
"LORELAI: Have your third taste, Mom. [leaves]"
"EMILY: Lorelai! Is she always this scattered?"
"SOOKIE: She's the stablest person I know."
"EMILY: That's very sad. Well, I think you're right, mushroom."
"SOOKIE: Great."
"EMILY: So, tell me more about your wedding."
"SOOKIE: Oh, I've just started planning so there's not that much to tell."
"EMILY: Well, have you decided on anything yet? The location or the music for the ceremony, maybe?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, we'll probably just, you know, wind up playing something off a CD."
"EMILY: Oh."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"EMILY: Well, CD's can be very unreliable. They break sometimes, or they skip, or the person assigned to turn them on and off gets distracted and the whole ceremony is ruined."
"SOOKIE: I hadn't thought of that."
"EMILY: Have you thought about live music?"
"SOOKIE: Well. . ."
"EMILY: A nice string ensemble."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, that sounds nice."
"EMILY: There are a couple of wonderful groups I could recommend."
"SOOKIE: Sure. I mean, I guess it doesn't hurt to check them out."
"EMILY: No, it doesn't. Mushroom soup."
"SOOKIE: String quartet."
"CUT TO FRONT DESK"
"[Lorelai walks over and picks up the phone]"
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: Yeah, hi."
"LORELAI: Hello."
"LUKE: How's it going?"
"LORELAI: Pretty good, pretty good. How's things with you?"
"LUKE: Oh, not bad. Dropped some eggs."
"LORELAI: Bummer."
"LUKE: Hazard of the business. Am I catching you at a bad time?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, it's kind of slow here. So slow, in fact, that Michel and I were about to get the tetherball out."
"LUKE: That's the thing with a ball tethered to a rope?"
"LORELAI: Hey, I never knew that's where the tether comes from."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's tethered. It's tied, like an anchor is tethered to a rope on a boat."
"LORELAI: Neat, neat."
"LUKE: Yeah, most people probably don't put that together."
"LORELAI: Probably not."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: So, anything else?"
"LUKE: Uh, yeah, actually  if I needed a room or two for a couple of days, would that be possible?"
"LORELAI: You need rooms?"
"LUKE: Like nine."
"LORELAI: You need nine rooms?"
"LUKE: Just for a couple of days, Wednesday and Thursday."
"LORELAI: Uh, well, I can take care of that. What's it for?"
"LUKE: Uh, just got some family coming in."
"LORELAI: Reunion? Cause we can get the tetherball out."
"LUKE: Nah, funeral."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Yeah, my Uncle Louie died last night and I'm arranging the funeral for him."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry. Here I was babbling about tetherball."
"LUKE: And you weren't babbling."
"LORELAI: Well, you've got nine rooms, Wednesday and Thursday."
"LUKE: You sure?"
"LORELAI: It's a done deal."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"LORELAI: Luke, I'm so, so sorry."
"LUKE: It's okay. It sounds like he went peaceful. He was eighty-five."
"LORELAI: But it's always hard. Um, are you okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm okay."
"LORELAI: Can I help you with anything else?"
"LUKE: No, the rooms are help enough."
"LORELAI: Are you sure, cause I'm dealing with my mom now and I'd be happy to rush over and help with whatever. You'd be doing me a favor."
"LUKE: The rooms are all I need, thanks."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"LUKE: Well, I gotta go."
"LORELAI: Call if you need anything."
"LUKE: I will. By the way, that French guy's a putz."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, he knows."
"LUKE: All right, see ya."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street towards the diner]"
"RORY: It's so sad."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: Was Luke, like, shaken over his uncle dying?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. He's so unflappable. It's hard to tell."
"RORY: The man definitely can't be flapped."
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the door. Luke is on the phone while several customers try to get his attention.]"
"WOMAN: Can I get another cup of coffee?"
"LUKE: In a minute."
"SY: Hey, is that my food?"
"MAN: More coffee here, too, please."
"LUKE: In a minute."
"SY: Is that my food?"
"KIRK: More coffee for me, too."
"LUKE: Shut up, Kirk."
"SY: Is that my food?"
"LUKE: Yes, Sy, that's your food."
"SY: Well, can I have it?"
"LUKE: I'm doing all I can here, folks."
"KIRK: I asked nicely."
"MAN: Hey, hey, watch the cord!"
"LUKE: Try ducking."
"KIRK: You should update to a cordless."
"LORELAI: Hey, whatcha doing? Watch, watch it."
"LUKE: Ah, buh buh buh. . .thanks, thanks, I'm on the phone."
"LORELAI: We noticed."
"LUKE: Yeah, I can't serve and be on the phone."
"RORY: We noticed that, too."
"LORELAI: But your reenactment of Jerry Lewis in The Diner Guy is gonna wow the critics."
"RORY: Where should the poached eggs go?"
"LUKE: Crank in the hat."
"SY: Hey, I'm not a crank! You're a crank, crank!"
"RORY: He is a crank."
"LORELAI: And the French toast?"
"LUKE: Lady with the giant purse. Ah, yup."
"MAN: This is not good."
"LORELAI: Hey, fall back cowboy."
"LUKE: Yo, whoa, whoa, whoa  what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Come here. Just stay on the phone and give me these. Where do they go?"
"LUKE: Table by the window."
"LORELAI: Don't you number your tables?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: You should number your tables."
"LUKE: What good would that do? If I said a number, you wouldn't know what table was what number."
"LORELAI: But all restaurants number their table. You should number your tables."
"LUKE: Table five, they go to table five."
"LORELAI: Cool. Which one is that?"
"LUKE: Table by the window."
"LORELAI: By the window, Elma."
"RORY: Got it, Gertie."
"KIRK: Hello? How 'bout that coffee?"
"LORELAI: I got it."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"KIRK: But, but  mine's a quarter caf."
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"KIRK: Three-fourths decaf, one-fourth caffeinated."
"LORELAI: I four-fourths don't care."
"KIRK: Fill it up."
"LUKE: Sorry about this."
"LORELAI: It's okay."
"LUKE: Sometimes you get the world's full of people who micromanage their lives to the point where they can't wait an extra second for anything."
"LORELAI: We're running out of coffee."
"LUKE: I'll make some more."
"LORELAI: No, I got it."
"LUKE: Do you know how?"
"LORELAI: Do I . . . ugh. . .I am Cathy Coffee, mister, the bastard offspring of Mrs. Folger and Juan Valdez."
"RORY: Hey Luke, where's Jess?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"RORY: School?"
"LUKE: Please. He's probably upstairs."
"RORY: Really? Excuse me."
"LUKE: It's too strong."
"LORELAI: No, it's not."
"LUKE: No, it's too strong."
"LORELAI: You're on the phone."
"LUKE: Not everybody likes it that strong."
"LORELAI: Well, then I shall convert them. I am the Jehovah's coffee girl."
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS"
"[Rory knocks on Luke's apartment door]"
"RORY: Jess, open up! I know you're in there."
"JESS: My, aren't we bright eyed and bushy tailed."
"RORY: Luke needs you downstairs."
"JESS: Why?"
"RORY: Because he's on the phone with someone and Caesar's off today and the place is packed and he needs help."
"JESS: I'll be down in a minute."
"RORY: No, now."
"JESS: I'm in the middle of something."
"RORY: Just assume that Jeannie's gonna get Major Healey out of whatever scrape he's in."
"JESS: Gee, thanks for spoiling it for me."
"CUT TO THE DINER"
"KIRK: I need some more Equal."
"LORELAI: There's one right there."
"KIRK: I need seven"
"LORELAI: Seven? You're not squirreling these away in your pocket for home use, are you, Kirk?"
"KIRK: No, I use seven in my coffee."
"LORELAI: Okay, good, then allow me. [pours seven Equals into his cup] There you go. Go ahead and give that a taste, see if it's to your liking."
"KIRK: Okay. [takes sip] Perfection."
"LORELAI: Good."
"[Jess stumbles into the diner, followed by Rory]"
"LORELAI: Well, you're very graceful."
"JESS: She pushed me."
"RORY: Sue me."
"JESS: I could've broken my neck."
"RORY: As long as it's not your arm. We need your arm."
"JESS: Despot."
"LUKE: Took me twenty minutes to get pass this place's stupid busy signal, then they put me on hold forever."
"LORELAI: Who's keeping you on hold?"
"LUKE: That mortuary in Florida where my uncle's at."
"LORELAI: Florida? I thought he was in the area."
"LUKE: No no, he spent most of his life here but retired to Orlando, so I gotta ship the body back here."
"LORELAI: Aw, he wanted to be buried in Stars Hollow?"
"LUKE: Nah, my dad wanted my uncle buried in Stars Hollow right next to him."
"LORELAI: That's nice."
"LUKE: Well, they were really close, and Louie didn't have any wife or kids to look out for things and before my dad died, he asked me if I'd look out for him."
"LORELAI: For Louie?"
"LUKE: Yeah, he just wanted me to make sure he got a proper funeral. You know, respectful, dignified."
"LORELAI: No horseshoe carnation wreaths, got it. Good man, that dad of yours."
"LUKE: And since Louie's a w*r veteran, the town Revolutionary w*r reenactors will attend the service, do the salute thing, you know. I mean, it makes me nauseous, but my dad wanted it. [on phone] Yeah, hi, I'm still here. . .Yes, the deceased is Louie Danes. . .Right. . .No, Hartford's not too far, I can do that. Thanks. [hangs up] Great, that's done. Uh, okay, I should probably go pick out a coffin before he gets here."
"LORELAI: Great, go."
"LUKE: I have to close up."
"LORELAI: No, you don't. You're covered."
"LUKE: You don't have to do this."
"LORELAI: We don't mind. Go. It'll give me a chance to number all the tables."
"LUKE: Be my guest."
"LORELAI: Also, are they arranged like this for any particular reason?"
"LUKE: Don't change anything."
"LORELAI: It's totally not feng shui."
"LUKE: Gertie."
"LORELAI: Go."
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[A customer walks up to Taylor]"
"MRS. CASSINI: Excuse me, Taylor, where are your Brussels sprouts?"
"TAYLOR: My supplier was out of them this week, Mrs. Cassini. Maybe next week."
"MRS. CASSINI: Oh, I wanted to make them tonight."
"TAYLOR: Sorry."
"MRS. CASSINI: Okay, I'll just try across the street. Thank you."
"TAYLOR: You're welcome. Across the street? [goes outside] What is that?"
"MRS. CASSINI: It's a farmer's market. Isn't it wonderful? It just opened this morning and. . .I see sprouts!"
"[Taylor walks over to the farmer's market]"
"TAYLOR: Who's the proprietor here?"
"PROPRIETOR: That would be me. What can I do for you?"
"TAYLOR: Wait a minute, I know you. You're that long-haired freak that wanted to be town troubadour even though that weird brown-corduroy-jacket-wearing freak was already it."
"PROPRIETOR: That's right, good memory! How are ya? [hugs him]"
"TAYLOR: Let go of me!"
"PROPRIETOR: Don't like to be touched, that's cool. Got a little David and Lisa thing happening? Made a mental note, no problem. Can I help you find something?"
"TAYLOR: I just want to know what inspired you to open a produce stand right across the street from my market."
"PROPRIETOR: Oh, is that your market?"
"TAYLOR: Yes, that's my market."
"PROPRIETOR: Well, it's real nice, homey. Bought a box of tissues there  good stuff, good stuff."
"MISS PATTY: Excuse me? Your parsley  is it priced per bunch or per pound?"
"PROPRIETOR: Per pound, beautiful."
"MISS PATTY: Mmm, good deal."
"TAYLOR: Patty!"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, hi Taylor, how are you?"
"TAYLOR: You mean not counting the knife sticking in my back?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, sure honey, whatever."
"TAYLOR: There must be some mistake  this just isn't right."
"PROPRIETOR: It's all approved by the proper authorities. I followed the rules, it's what my father taught me. Cop for twenty years, got sh*t in the butt. Good man  tips over sometimes when he sits  but good man."
"MRS. CASSINI: Beautiful sprouts."
"PROPRIETOR: For a beautiful lady."
"MRS. CASSINI: Thank you."
"TAYLOR: I feel sick."
"PROPRIETOR: That'll be four dollars. See ya, Mr. Doose."
"TAYLOR: I wanna lie down."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel is at the front desk as Lorelai walks over]"
"MICHEL: Ah, Lorelai, good  tell me about the nine rooms set aside here. There's no name anywhere that I can see, and no credit card to hold them. Mistake?"
"LORELAI: No, it's for Luke."
"MICHEL: For who?"
"LORELAI: Luke from Luke's Diner."
"MICHEL: Nine rooms for Luke from Luke's Diner?"
"LORELAI: That's right."
"MICHEL: French fry convention?"
"LORELAI: No, just personal."
"MICHEL: Milkshake symposium?"
"LORELAI: No Michel, it's something personal and I'm vouching for him."
"MICHEL: Soda pop seminar?"
"LORELAI: Stop!"
"MICHEL: Pickle party?"
"LORELAI: He's got nine rooms, now stifle."
"[Lorelai walks away as Emily enters the inn]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom, hi there."
"EMILY: Lorelai, hello."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, did we get our signals crossed? I don't remember making an appointment with you."
"EMILY: We have to make appointments to see each other?"
"LORELAI: No, but  good one."
"EMILY: I'm not here to see you."
"LORELAI: Oh, this isn't about the DAR meeting?"
"EMILY: No, that's all ready to go. I'm here to meet with Sookie."
"LORELAI: Sookie?"
"EMILY: I'm a little late, traffic was awful. Excuse me, would you?"
"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[The tables are set with fancy place settings and flowers.]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: Aren't they beautiful?"
"LORELAI: Gorgeous. What are they for?"
"SOOKIE: My wedding."
"LORELAI: Your wedding?"
"SOOKIE: Emily, hi!"
"EMILY: Well, is this everything I said it was?"
"SOOKIE: And more."
"LORELAI: What do you mean they're for your wedding?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, it's this company's sample place setting. Emily set me up with them. They did Celine Dion's wedding, and Steven Spielberg's daughter's Jack Russell Terrier's Bark Mitzvah."
"LORELAI: You're putting me on."
"SOOKIE: I couldn't make that up."
"EMILY: Excuse me, this one's slightly asymmetrical. Fix these."
"LORELAI: Hey, um, what is with the fancy place settings? I thought you were just gonna keep it simple."
"SOOKIE: It is simple."
"LORELAI: It lights up."
"SOOKIE: Just flip a switch, simple."
"LORELAI: Tell me how my mother got so involved in all of this."
"SOOKIE: She's not that involved. She just mentioned the other day when she was here that she knew some people that could make some samples of stuff for us, like table settings and flower arrangements."
"LORELAI: But we were gonna do the flowers ourselves."
"SOOKIE: I know, but what a hassle that would be."
"LORELAI: It's to save money  flowers cost a fortune."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, but, the sampling of  what they're doing today  it's free. I'm not committed to any of this."
"LORELAI: I hope not."
"SOOKIE: It's true  I say no, it all goes away. Not a penny is spent."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"SOOKIE: And it's fun."
"LORELAI: I don't wanna take away your fun, I just want you to be careful. See, you've entered Emilyland."
"SOOKIE: Emilyland?"
"LORELAI: It's an upside down world where the Horchow House is considered low-rent and diamonds less than twenty-four carats are Cracker Jack trinkets and Bentleys are for losers who can't afford a Rolls."
"SOOKIE: But I'm okay, really."
"LORELAI: All right. I have to help Luke with the lunch rush today, so I gotta go."
"SOOKIE: Go, we're fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. Bye Mom."
"EMILY: [picks up a glass] Is that a fingerprint? My God, that's a fingerprint! Who touched this? Let me see your hands!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Taylor is sitting at a table mumbling to himself as Rory walks by]"
"TAYLOR: Turnips, turnips, turnips. . ."
"RORY: What?"
"TAYLOR: Huh?"
"RORY: What about turnips?"
"TAYLOR: Why did you say turnips?"
"RORY: Because you said turnips."
"TAYLOR: No, I didn't."
"RORY: I think you did."
"TAYLOR: Nope."
"RORY: Okay."
"TAYLOR: But I've got turnips  good ones, too. They're not as big as that crinite freak's turnips, but who needs bloated turnips? Mine are unassuming. I have nice, humble turnips."
"RORY: Okie dokie. [walks to the counter] Taylor's wigging."
"LORELAI: I know. He's been sitting there like the final days of Dick Nixon for almost an hour."
"RORY: Keep an eye on him."
"[a customer walks in and sits at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Hello there, how's it going?"
"CUSTOMER: Very good, young lady. You're still serving breakfast?"
"LORELAI: We serve it all day. What'll you have?"
"CUSTOMER: Two eggs up on toast."
"LORELAI: Up, huh?"
"CUSTOMER: Yup."
"LORELAI: Wouldn't you rather have them scrambled?"
"CUSTOMER: Nope, up's how I like them."
"LORELAI: Come on, scrambled's better. Give it a sh*t. Say you want two scrambled eggs on toast, please?"
"CUSTOMER: Okay, young lady, two scrambled eggs on toast."
"LORELAI: Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck them! That's real live diner talk, see? The wreck them is the scrambled part."
"CUSTOMER: I deduced that."
"TAYLOR: I don't believe it, I don't believe it!"
"LORELAI: What's the matter?"
"TAYLOR: That's Babette with an armload of rutabagas, and there's Miss Patty again  since when does she eat so much fruit?"
"[Kirk enters the diner]"
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk."
"KIRK: Hello. Where's Luke?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he's busy with some stuff so Rory and I are helping out. What can I get you?"
"KIRK: I don't know. I want lunch, but I'm not sure what to get."
"LORELAI: I have a suggestion. How about a hamburger with some strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert?"
"KIRK: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: Yo, burn one, then pass me a pink stick and throw some mud on it! God, I love this business."
"[The proprietor of the farmer's market enters the diner]"
"PROPRIETOR: Boy, it's freezing out there."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's quite a cold snap. How bout a hot blonde with sand?"
"PROPRIETOR: Coffee with cream and sugar would be great, thanks. Make sure its' foot's out the door."
"LORELAI: Put it in a cup to go, got it."
"PROPRIETOR: This icy weather hasn't kept customers away, though. They just keep coming. A lot of vegetable soup being eaten tonight, yesiree. Hope I don't put the good people at Campbell's out of business. Oh, hey Taylor. Didn't notice you there."
"TAYLOR: Hello."
"PROPRIETOR: Taking a little break? I don't see how if you're anywhere near as busy as I am. Keep waiting for a lull, I never get one. I say to the people, hey, I'll be back in a jif' and they're  look at them  they're lining up out there already."
"TAYLOR: Well, FYI, Van Halen hair, I'm plenty busy, but a good well-groomed businessman with properly prepared staff can take a break now and then."
"KIRK: It probably helped that your store was completely dead, too."
"TAYLOR: It was not dead."
"KIRK: I thought it was closed when I walked by, but then I saw Gabby sitting at the cash register reading a tabloid."
"TAYLOR: Shut up, Kirk."
"KIRK: Tapping on the counter with one of those little astrological scrolls."
"TAYLOR: Enough."
"LORELAI: Here you go."
"PROPRIETOR: Gracias. Oh boy, it's a mob scene. [leaves]"
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS"
"[Lorelai knocks on Luke's apartment door]"
"LORELAI: Luke, it's me."
"[Luke opens the door]"
"LORELAI: Hey. I brought you a wimpy with a rose pinned on it."
"LUKE: A what?"
"LORELAI: Turkey burger with onions."
"LUKE: Oh, thanks. Come on in."
"LORELAI: How's the money pit coming?"
"LUKE: Oh, just uh. . .that's it."
"LORELAI: What's the matter?"
"LUKE: Nothing. None of them are coming  not a one."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"LUKE: My relatives  the ones I booked all the rooms for  not one is coming to Louie's funeral."
"LORELAI: You're kidding  why?"
"LUKE: I don't know, which lame-o excuse do you wanna hear first? A bunch of them claimed they can't get outta work."
"LORELAI: It's not so lame-o."
"LUKE: Randy and Barbara don't wanna miss their brat kid's rugby semifinal."
"LORELAI: Rugby has semifinals?"
"LUKE: My sister never even called back. My cousins Paul and Jim, who my dad helped put through college, said they were too exhausted from a fishing trip. And slightly disturbed cousin Franny said she can't leave because her Petey's sick."
"LORELAI: Son?"
"LUKE: Parrot."
"LORELAI: Petey the parrot?"
"LUKE: I saw the stupid thing once on a visit, flapping its wings like crazy, banging around, squawking the only two words it knows over and over  Petey and gorgeous. Gorgeous, Petey, gorgeous, Petey!"
"LORELAI: That's disturbing."
"LUKE: My family's disturbing."
"LORELAI: I'm so sorry."
"LUKE: This is wrong, this is not how it's done. A family member dies, you pay your respects  period."
"LORELAI: Look at it this way  if they don't wanna be there, you don't want them there."
"LUKE: My dad wanted them to be there."
"LORELAI: I know. But hey, Louie lived in Stars Hollow most of his life, so a lot of people from here will be there, right?"
"LUKE: Right."
"LORELAI: I know it's upsetting, but maybe it's better this way."
"LUKE: Yeah, I guess. I really hate that bird."
"[Rory walks into the apartment]"
"RORY: Hey Mom?"
"LORELAI: What's up, honey? You got a herd of bulls shopping for China?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Customers  how long have you owned a diner?"
"RORY: Sorry. Jackson's outside, he wants to talk to you, he says it's important."
"LORELAI: About what?"
"RORY: I don't know. He seems upset."
"LORELAI: Ah. All right. You okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah, thanks."
"LORELAI: You might wanna study up on that diner talk."
"LUKE: I'll do that tonight."
"RORY: Hey Luke, where's Jess?"
"LUKE: I don't know, he's probably out playing basketball or something."
"RORY: That little punk."
"CUT TO DINER"
"[Lorelai walks down from upstairs and stops at the counter to help a customer]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, uh, can I take your order?"
"CUSTOMER: Yes, uh, bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, no mayo."
"LORELAI: Yo, uh, I need a piggy piggy with a green bla. . .uh, green bed, green blanket. . . BLT, no mayo! Rats."
""
""
""
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai walks out of the diner over to Jackson]"
"LORELAI: Jackson?"
"JACKSON: I'm a miserable man."
"LORELAI: What's up?"
"JACKSON: Remember that sweet, simple, affordable little wedding Sookie and I agreed on with minimal disagreement  no disagreement, in fact  perhaps the first time in the history of wedding planning that a couple agreed one hundred percent on everything?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"JACKSON: Gone. Ancient history. It's the Library of Alexandria, it's the Colossus of Roads, it's Pop Rocks, it's over, and do you know why?"
"LORELAI: My mother?"
"JACKSON: Look! [points to Sookie and Emily near the gazebo]"
"LORELAI: What are they doing?"
"JACKSON: They're measuring the town."
"LORELAI: They're what?"
"JACKSON: They're measuring the entire town with tape measures."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"JACKSON: Your mother got hers at Neiman Marcus. It's platinum with gold leaf  it costs more than my car!"
"LORELAI: I am so sorry."
"JACKSON: Look, I love Sookie and I want her to have what she wants, but . . . you see what they're doing now?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"JACKSON: According to their diagrams, that's where the sixteen-piece orchestra goes."
"LORELAI: How are they gonna fit a sixteen-piece orchestra in the gazebo?"
"JACKSON: Oh, they wanna move the gazebo."
"LORELAI: What?"
"JACKSON: A gazebo that's been there for a hundred years and they wanna move it. Who moves a gazebo? What kind of twisted mind even thinks about moving a gazebo?"
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll take care of this."
"JACKSON: She's so excited."
"LORELAI: She's brainwashed. She's Patricia Hearst and my mother is the SLA."
"JACKSON: I just hope it's not too late."
"LORELAI: I hope so, too."
"[Rory walks by, pulling Jess behind her]"
"JESS: Watch the shirt!"
"RORY: Cork it!"
"CUT TO THE DANCE STUDIO"
"[Taylor is at the podium leading a town meeting]"
"MISS PATTY: Well, it seems the right thing to do, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I concur. When one gazes at Stars Hollow, one can easily overlook a vital component of its beauty and that's the humble yet spunky twinkle light."
"JESS: Holy cow."
"LUKE: It doesn't get fruitier."
"TAYLOR: Harry's House of Twinkle Lights has been an integral part of this time for twenty years, so it's only right that we honor his retirement. So I hereby designate next Tuesday, Harry the Twinkle Light Man from Harry's House of Twinkle Lights Day."
"JESS: Well, that just trips off the tongue."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"TAYLOR: Late again, are we?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I hope I'm not pregnant!"
"TAYLOR: What?"
"LORELAI: Are these seats taken?"
"LUKE: Don't drag me into this."
"TAYLOR: You really have to work on your punctuality, Lorelai. I banged the meeting in a half an hour ago."
"LORELAI: Uh, dirty!"
"TAYLOR: I'm gonna take advantage of this unexpected pause in our proceedings to confer with Miss Patty about the next item on our agenda."
"LORELAI: What'd we miss?"
"LUKE: Harry's retiring."
"RORY: The twinkle light man?"
"LORELAI: What do we do for twinkle lights?"
"LUKE: Go to any discount store?"
"LORELAI: Blasphemy."
"RORY: What are you doing here anyhow? This is a town meeting for people who participate in and care about the town."
"JESS: Well, Corky's Country Cavalcade on public access was pre-empted, so I thought I'd check out the next best thing."
"LORELAI: I'm surprised you have time to be here."
"LUKE: I don't, but I haven't been able to get any of the w*r reenactors on the phone and I have to confirm them for Louie's funeral."
"TAYLOR: All right now, the last order of business is a matter relating personally to me, therefore I'm going to give Miss Patty my gavel."
"LORELAI: Again, dirty!"
"TAYLOR: Stop that. Now don't go power mad."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, all right, gee. Now the chair recognizes Taylor Doose. Taylor, you have the floor."
"TAYLOR: Thank you, Patty. My issue, ladies and gentlemen, is in the form of a grievance against this hirsute hippie who opened a produce stand in the park."
"BABETTE: Oh yeah, k*ll veggies."
"SY: Tasty."
"MISS PATTY: The squash is beautiful."
"BABETTE: Sexy  it's sexy squash."
"TAYLOR: Sexy or not, I demand that this man produce his permit post haste."
"PROPRIETOR: Got it right here."
"TAYLOR: Mm hmm, just what I thought. This is not the proper permit for this kind of business. This is a type twenty-four B, otherwise known as a cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk permit. This is not valid for your business."
"PROPRIETOR: Why'd you say it twice?"
"TAYLOR: Hmm?"
"BABETTE: You said cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk."
"LORELAI: It's repetitive."
"RORY: And redundant."
"LORELAI: It's repetitive."
"RORY: And redundant."
"LORELAI: We certainly are entertaining, Mac."
"RORY: Indubitably, Tosh."
"TAYLOR: It's not redundant. It's three separate things. It's a cart, a kiosk, and a mechanical hybrid referred to as a cart-slash-kiosk, hence cart, kiosk, cart/kiosk."
"BABETTE: He did it again."
"KIRK: He's been stressed lately. His store is deserted."
"TAYLOR: I'll make it simple. This is for businesses that roll in in the morning and roll out at night. Emphasis on the word roll  rolling businesses, businesses that roll."
"PROPRIETOR: But I carry my tables out at night."
"TAYLOR: But you're supposed to roll them, Rapunzel, and carrying isn't rolling, is it? I mean, did anyone hear the word rolling come out of his mouth? Check the transcript, I think you'll find one word missing  rolling!"
"MISS PATTY: Transcript?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Taylor, this isn't Charlie Rose."
"BABETTE: He's losing his marbles."
"ANDREW: It's just a personal vendetta."
"KIRK: His store is deserted."
"MISS PATTY: I think that we should end the meeting right here, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Wait a second, wait a second! You there, when Lady Godiva here wanted to be town troubadour over you, I stood by your side. Why aren't you backing me now?"
"TROUBADOUR: Cause you left me twistin' for a long time before you did, Taylor, and it didn't feel good. I even wrote a song about the experience."
"LORELAI: Oh, I heard it. It's called ""Taylor Left Me Twistin'."""
"RORY: Oh yeah, it's really good."
"TROUBADOUR: You think? Because I'm having a little trouble with the chorus. Taylor left me twistin', he set my eyes a mistin'. I'm just not sure if it has that thing, though, you know?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I love that part. I actually thought that maybe at the end you could do more about the sweater. We'll talk."
"MISS PATTY: I'm gonna wrap this up."
"TAYLOR: Now, Patty, how would you feel if this guy decided to open the long-haired freak school of dance or the long-haired freak diner, Luke? Or the long-haired freak bookstore? It's not good, right?"
"MISS PATTY: All right, everybody who agrees that we would not feel good about that, say aye."
"ALL: Aye!"
"MISS PATTY: Meeting adjourned, goodnight."
"LORELAI: Another fun one!"
"LUKE: Taylor, hold on a sec!"
"RORY: [to Jess] Don't you have some cleaning up to do over at the diner?"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[As people exit the meeting, Luke runs over to Taylor and the other reenactors]"
"LUKE: Guys, hold it, come on, you heard me calling you, stop!"
"TAYLOR: What is it, Luke?"
"LUKE: What do you mean, what is it? My Uncle Louie's funeral is tomorrow afternoon and I haven't heard from any of you. The man was a World w*r II veteran, that's what you reenactor freaks do  you go to vet's funerals, so you're gonna be there, right? Hello?"
"TAYLOR: You said you were gonna talk to him, Sy."
"SY: Bert said he was gonna do it."
"BERT: It's Taylor's job."
"SY: You always pass the buck."
"LUKE: Talk to me about what, guys?"
"TAYLOR: You might as well know, Luke. We don't wanna go to Louie's funeral."
"LUKE: What?"
"ANDREW: We all hated Louie."
"LUKE: Oh, come on, that's not true."
"TAYLOR: He always had a scowl on his face, not a kind word for anybody. He would light those hideous cigars, blow smoke in people's faces and then spit after each puff."
"SY: He was disgusting."
"ANDREW: And mean."
"KIRK: He kicked my dog when I was a kid."
"SY: He hit on my wife repeatedly."
"KIRK: Toto was always different after that."
"SY: My wife was much affected as well."
"KIRK: I'd toss her something to fetch and she'd start to run after it and halfway there she'd forget what she was doing."
"SY: She never enjoyed her soap operas the same after that."
"KIRK: She'd just lie down and go to sleep."
"LUKE: This is an exaggeration."
"BERT: We're not exaggerating. We threw a big party when he left town!"
"SY: I made love to my life that night like I never have."
"KIRK: My Toto barked a happy bark, then quietly stopped breathing. She was old."
"LUKE: I don't believe this."
"ANDREW: Come on, Luke. You knew the guy."
"LUKE: This man was my uncle, okay, and a w*r veteran. He deserves a veteran's funeral, but hey, if you guys are too lazy to show up, then. . ."
"TAYLOR: He's the lazy one. Never once did he participate in a town function. In fact, when we reenactors gathered, he'd throw things at us."
"SY: And not soft things, hard things."
"BERT: Rocks, and small tools."
"LUKE: Okay, I've heard enough."
"SY: And he got meaner as he got older. Never married, never had kids."
"BERT: A real loner."
"LUKE: To hell with you guys, who needs you! I might just throw rocks and small tools at you myself next time I see ya!"
"TAYLOR: A defensive hothead, just like Louie!"
"BERT: They're practically clones."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie is sitting in front of a computer and Michel is looking over her shoulder as Lorelai walks in]"
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, this is so hi-tech."
"LORELAI: Hey. What's going on?"
"SOOKIE: I'm downloading wedding stuff from Prague."
"LORELAI: Oh, you're kidding."
"SOOKIE: It's streaming in right now. That's Internet talk  streaming. Did you know that? And did you know it's not called Czechoslovakia anymore? It's just Czech Republic. Slovakia is its own separate thing. It's weird, isn't it? It's like if we just suddenly started saying there's no more Connecticut, it's just Connec. . . Ticut."
"LORELAI: Sookie, what are you downloading from Prague?"
"MICHEL: Oh, this will much amuse you."
"SOOKIE: Color samples for the big ceramic stands."
"LORELAI: Big ceramic stands for what?"
"SOOKIE: For the giant papier-mâché mushrooms."
"LORELAI: What are the papier-mâché mushrooms for?"
"SOOKIE: For the midgets dressed like angels to dance under, silly."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: Emily found the best papier-mâché mushroom maker in Paris. He's much better than the guy that makes them in Belgium  what a hack."
"LORELAI: Sookie, honey, I need you stop staring and streaming for one second. We need to talk."
"MICHEL: Please, please do not talk her out of these things. I do not want to die without seeing midgets dancing with a mushroom."
"LORELAI: Stay out of this."
"MICHEL: Oh, you're no fun."
"SOOKIE: What is it honey?"
"LORELAI: The danger of Emilyworld is that you don't always know you're in it, when actually you are."
"SOOKIE: Aw, not this Emilyworld stuff again"
"LORELAI: Sookie, have you run the numbers on any of this? What is this costing you?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know the full cost but your mother is getting me fifty percent off everything. She is so connected."
"LORELAI: Okay, but fifty percent off a load of money is still half a load of money. You don't have half a load to spend."
"SOOKIE: Well, if I scrimp I can afford a quarter load."
"LORELAI: That's still too much."
"SOOKIE: Well, your mother said she'd chip in a little."
"LORELAI: Sookie, that is way, way, way inappropriate."
"SOOKIE: I didn't take her up on it but it was nice."
"LORELAI: Sookie, this isn't you, the midgets and the mushrooms and God knows what else. And it isn't Jackson either."
"SOOKIE: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: We talked."
"SOOKIE: You and Jackson talked?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry but he came to me all upset, and I love you Sookie and I love him too and it just seemed like it was time for me to meddle."
"SOOKIE: He was upset?"
"LORELAI: He was pretty upset."
"SOOKIE: Why didn't he just talk to me?"
"LORELAI: Because he's Jackson, he wants you to be happy and to give you everything you want. So what it comes down to is  is this what you want?"
"SOOKIE: Well, maybe the midgets are a little over the top. And the mushrooms. . . oh my God, it's all sounding so silly now."
"LORELAI: You're coming out of it, keep going."
"SOOKIE: No, no, it's not what I want! We were supposed to keep this nice and simple. God, we had it all worked out."
"LORELAI: So go back."
"SOOKIE: I will go back. That is, if Jackson still wants to marry me."
"LORELAI: Of course he still wants to marry you."
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna call him and I'm gonna tell him it's all changing back."
"LORELAI: Good."
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, I should call and cancel some stuff first. I've gotta call Belgium and Oslo and, uh, oh, Copenhagen, Bora Bora."
"LORELAI: What did you order from there?"
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna shield you from that one."
"LORELAI: Thanks. [answers phone] Hello?. . .Luke!. . . Slow down, slow down. . . Okay, I'll come right over. [hangs up] I gotta go. Call, call, and welcome back, friend."
"SOOKIE: Thanks. Ooh, I'm gonna start with Hong Kong. I'm hoping those acrobats can get another gig."
"CUT TO FUNERAL HOME"
"[Luke is waiting impatiently near a casket as Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: There you are. What  ."
"LUKE: It won't close."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: The lid."
"LORELAI: To what? [sees casket] Oh, hello. . . Louie."
"LUKE: That's Louie."
"LORELAI: Nice tan. So, now, you say the lid won't close?"
"LUKE: Yes, the lid won't close."
"LORELAI: Did you buy the right size?"
"LUKE: Of course I bought the right size."
"FUNERAL DIRECTOR: It's the model we recommend for those of medium height and weight."
"LUKE: And he's of medium height and weight."
"LORELAI: So then why won't it close?"
"LUKE: Because of the stuff."
"LORELAI: What stuff?"
"LUKE: The stuff. He left a list of stuff he wanted buried with him."
"FUNERAL DIRECTOR: It's not uncommon."
"LUKE: It's a very long list. His fishing reel, bowling trophy, a flask, his antique dueling p*stol, his copy of Sherman's Memoirs."
"LORELAI: So is all the stuff in there now?"
"LUKE: Yes, it is. I shoved it in the best I could but now it won't close which defeats the entire purpose of having a damn casket in the first place."
"LORELAI: May I?"
"LUKE: Give it a sh*t."
"[Lorelai tries to push the lid close, but it pops back up]"
"LORELAI: Whoa!"
"LUKE: The football signed by Johnny Unitas gives it that bounce."
"LORELAI: What if we moved the gas mask and the pith helmet down towards the feet?"
"LUKE: That end already has every baseball card he ever bought, thousands of them."
"LORELAI: Oh, bungee cord! No. Um, what if we got some people from the office here, you know, accounting or whatever, to sit on the lid and then we could latch it? Do you have anybody you could spring. . .hm. I'm out of ideas."
"LUKE: So am I. You know what, to hell with this. To hell with this!"
"LORELAI: Luke, now come on."
"LUKE: I can't deal with this anymore!"
"LORELAI: Well, it has to be dealt with."
"LUKE: No, it doesn't. It's not as if he deserves my help or my respect."
"LORELAI: The man was your uncle."
"LUKE: He was a jerk!"
"LORELAI: Don't say that."
"LUKE: No, no, Taylor and the guys were right. I was cutting Louie slack out of respect for my dad, but the man was rotten and mean and selfish all his life. For God's sake, he's even selfish in death. Other people would've loved to have had those baseball cards. I would've loved to have those baseball cards. He's got Lou Gehrig's rookie card, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, tons of others  but no! My uncle, King Tut, has to take all of them to the afterlife with him!"
"FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Sir, your voice."
"LUKE: I'm done, I've had it. From now on, it's just the bare minimum and that's it. Dig a big hole and just dump the casket in unlatched. If stuff falls out, fine. Just pile on enough dirt and make sure nothing's showing! [leaves]"
"LORELAI: I'm assuming that wouldn't be appropriate either?"
"FUNERAL DIRECTOR: No."
"LORELAI: I didn't think so."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Jess is walking around the tables refilling coffee]"
"CUSTOMER: Young man, where's the young lady we've heard so much about who's using those delightful old diner phrases to place people's orders? It sounds so fun. Could you point her out for us?"
"JESS: No. [walks to counter] That's everyone. I'll be upstairs."
"RORY: Thanks for doing the very least you could possibly do."
"JESS: You're welcome."
"[Luke enters the diner]"
"LORELAI: Luke, there you are. I was worried."
"LUKE: Yeah, sorry, I should've called. Thanks for covering again. This'll be the last time, I promise."
"LORELAI: It's okay. Where were you?"
"LUKE: Well, at first, I walked around a bunch, ya know, just trying to clear my head. Saw a lot of Hartford  and what a cesspool."
"LORELAI: Well, you're not a city man."
"LUKE: Then I calmed down after awhile and I figured dumping Louie's body in an open grave with all his stuff probably would be a little cold."
"LORELAI: Just a tad."
"LUKE: So I got a Yellow Pages and I found the Big and Tall Casket Shop in Hartford."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"LUKE: Nope, I found a casket that would fit my hundred and sixty pound uncle and his hundred and forty pounds of stuff, got the lid to shut the first time we tried it, so the funeral's on as scheduled."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: I still don't know why I'm doing this."
"LORELAI: You're doing it for your dad."
"LUKE: Yeah, I guess. Although he's dead so he'd never know if I was doing it any different."
"LORELAI: He knows. He's got the big Luke picture screen on twenty four hours a day and he watches and smiles. And you're doing it cause you're you."
"LUKE: Hey, I'm gonna change real fast and you can retire from your diner career forever."
"LORELAI: Oh no, it's fun. I came up with some new diner phrases. Do you know what a Lucky Duck Cluck is?"
"LUKE: Not offhand."
"LORELAI: It's foie gras with chicken and green shamrock frosting."
"LUKE: Why would anyone ever order that?"
"LORELAI: If they're high. [sees Emily enter the diner] Ugh, good grief."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Bad vibe sandwich just came in, better retreat."
"LUKE: I won't be long. [goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"EMILY: Since when do you work here?"
"LORELAI: I'm just lending a hand. What's going on?"
"EMILY: I went by the inn to work with Sookie on her wedding."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"EMILY: And she fired me."
"LORELAI: I'm sure she didn't fire you."
"EMILY: She claims to have changed her mind on all the things we had planned."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe she did."
"EMILY: No, she didn't. I know what's behind this. That is, who's behind this."
"LORELAI: Mom, it was getting to be too much for her and too much for her fiancé."
"EMILY: I knew it."
"LORELAI: Mom, these are not wealthy people, do you understand that? They're saving for a home and your midgets were dancing between them and their dreams."
"EMILY: You say midgets like it's so absurd."
"LORELAI: Do you hear yourself?"
"EMILY: I don't see what was so wrong with my just helping Sookie plan her wedding."
"LORELAI: Mom, come on."
"EMILY: What, come on?"
"LORELAI: You weren't planning Sookie's wedding."
"EMILY: Well, then, whose wedding was I planning?"
"LORELAI: Mine."
"EMILY: Don't be ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Mom, your vision for this wedding and all the over the top stuff and the gazillion dollar flowers and bunting and champagne fountain and the Haute Couture dress  who's wearing that wedding dress in your mind's eye, Mom? Is it Sookie or is it me?"
"EMILY: I wasn't planning your wedding, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Right."
"EMILY: The wedding I was planning was for Sookie. The mushrooms and colors, they all seemed like fun. A little crazy, just like she is. It definitely was not for you."
"LORELAI: Okay Mom."
"EMILY: I know that in a million years, you would never let me plan your wedding. I gave up on that dream a long time ago. Yours was going to be a Russian winter theme  the Romanovs."
"LORELAI: Before the firing squad, I assume?"
"EMILY: Snow white roses, trees with white lights and candles, snow everywhere, you arriving in a silver sleigh with white horses."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"EMILY: You hate the idea."
"LORELAI: No, no, I just  ."
"EMILY: You just hate it."
"LORELAI: No, it just doesn't seem like me."
"EMILY: Yes, well, it would've been beautiful."
"LORELAI: I'm sure it would've been."
"EMILY: Anyhow, it's obvious that wouldn't even be appropriate anymore being as I'm probably standing in your reception hall."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: Burgers and fries for the dinner? The bride walks down the aisle with a ketchup dispenser in her hand."
"LORELAI: Please tell me what you're talking about."
"EMILY: I'm talking about Luke."
"LORELAI: Luke? Mom!"
"EMILY: Well, it's obvious, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: No, it's not, Mom."
"EMILY: You're with him constantly."
"LORELAI: He feeds me."
"EMILY: You bring up his name constantly."
"LORELAI: Once again, he feeds me."
"EMILY: The moment he calls, you run to his side."
"LORELAI: He's my friend, he needed me, I had to be there."
"EMILY: Yes, I know you did."
"[Luke comes down the stairs and walks over to them]"
"LUKE: Hi."
"EMILY: Hello. I have to go. I'll see you for dinner tonight, Lorelai. And Luke, I'm sure I'll see you again soon. What do you think of the Romanovs?"
"LUKE: They probably had it coming."
"EMILY: A match made in heaven."
"CUT TO CEMETERY"
"[Lorelai and Luke are alone at the funeral]"
"REVEREND: We're here, of course, to honor Louie, to pay our respects and to bid him a sorrowful goodbye."
"LORELAI: Are you okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah. I'm not big on funerals in general."
"LORELAI: Nobody is."
"REVEREND: He passed away in his sleep, so the end came peacefully for Louie, which I'm sure is a great comfort to all who knew him."
"LUKE: The passing away part was a great comfort for all who knew him."
"REVEREND: I didn't know him."
"LUKE: Good thing."
"REVEREND: But I understand he was a fine man, destined to be missed by many."
"LUKE: Especially ones that were suing him."
"LORELAI: Stop. Sorry father."
"REVEREND: Reverend."
"LORELAI: Right."
"REVEREND: Now let us witness Louie Danes as he is interred and brought to the Lord."
"LORELAI: It was a nice service. Nice and, um, intimate."
"LUKE: I guess everybody deserves something at the end. Thanks for coming."
"LORELAI: I wouldn't have missed it."
"LUKE: That ain't me, is it?"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"LUKE: What Taylor said about me being like Louie, a loner, never being married and stuff. I mean, I am getting crankier as I get older, he's not so far off."
"LORELAI: You are not your uncle. I mean, would Louie ever build someone a chuppah, or help fix things around someone's house without being asked, or make a special coffee cake with balloons for a girl's sixteenth birthday?"
"LUKE: Rory told you about that?"
"LORELAI: Yes. And would Louie have taken in his sister's kid without hesitating and without asking for anything in return?"
"LUKE: No one would've trusted Louie with their kid. He probably would've forgotten to feed him or something."
"LORELAI: You get my point?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I get it. [he hears drumming] What's that? [he sees one of the reenactors walking onto the cemetery] Is that Andrew?"
"LORELAI: I believe it is."
"[the other reenactors arrive]"
"LUKE: That's all of them."
"[The reenactors start doing their salute]"
"LUKE: Thanks."
"LORELAI: It's what your dad wanted."
"LUKE: Yeah. Oh, I know Louie would've hated this."
"LORELAI: That's just a fringe benefit."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Luke and Lorelai are walking toward the diner]"
"LORELAI: Do you think he's in heaven?"
"LUKE: I hope so, just so my dad can kick his butt around the place."
"LORELAI: Can you kick when you're in heaven?"
"LUKE: It's probably frowned upon."
"LORELAI: Yeah, plus you're all see-through and gauzy and your dad's foot could go right through him."
"LUKE: This is a silly conversation. What's all this?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea."
"CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke and Lorelai walk into the diner, which is packed with people]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"LUKE: What's going on?"
"RORY: It's kind of like a wake."
"LUKE: A wake?"
"LORELAI: For Louie?"
"RORY: I thought you set it up"
"LORELAI: I didn't set it up."
"RORY: Well, it's going well, anyway. People brought a ton of food if you're hungry."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"LUKE: This is unexpected."
"LORELAI: Very."
"LUKE: Don't you have wakes for people you like?"
"LORELAI: I think it might be for you."
"LUKE: Am I dead?"
"LORELAI: Face it, Luke, people like you."
"LUKE: Shut up."
"LORELAI: And with charm like that, how can they resist?"
"[The farmer's market proprietor walks up to Taylor]"
"PROPRIETOR: Hey Taylor, cool threads. Very ""One if By Land."""
"TAYLOR: Mm hmm."
"PROPRIETOR: I see you're digging into the vegetables."
"TAYLOR: Thanks for the play by play."
"PROPRIETOR: Brought those myself. Hey, how was the funeral?"
"TAYLOR: Shouldn't you be tending to your little stand out there, friend?"
"PROPRIETOR: Oh, the stand's gone."
"TAYLOR: What?"
"PROPRIETOR: It's gone, I'm all packed up, I'm outta here."
"TAYLOR: I don't get it."
"PROPRIETOR: I just grow all that stuff in my back yard and as of yesterday, sold it all."
"TAYLOR: You sold it all?"
"PROPRIETOR: Sold it all, made enough money to do some traveling. Have you ever been to Israel? Turbulent, I know, but I thought I'd go down and try to plant some peace down there, know what I mean? See if it grows and see if it spreads."
"TAYLOR: Shut up. Why did you put me through all that hoohah at the town meeting if your vegetable business was just temporary?"
"PROPRIETOR: Actually, you put yourself through it, Taylor. You put yourself through it."
"[Rory walks over to Jess]"
"RORY: Nice spread."
"JESS: People have too much free time in this town."
"RORY: You did a good thing."
"JESS: What do you mean?"
"RORY: I thought my mom set this up. Turns out she didn't."
"JESS: So? Wasn't me."
"RORY: It wasn't?"
"JESS: Nah, no way. It wasn't me."
"RORY: If you say so."
"JESS: Look, the crazy ballet teacher called and asked when Luke was getting back from the funeral, if I could unlock the door. I came down, I unlocked the door, then went back upstairs and back to sleep."
"RORY: So you did do a little something."
"JESS: I unlocked the door."
"RORY: So that people could come in here and put this together. Nice."
"JESS: Nice for them, not for me."
"RORY: You facilitated it, you made it happen, so I guess that means that you're officially apart of our town now."
"JESS: Hey, wait a minute."
"RORY: Welcome."
"JESS: I am not part of this town."
"RORY: See you for some tree planting over at the Arbor Day Festival, buddy."
"JESS: Yeah, well maybe I can knock over a liquor store while everyone else is planting those stupid trees."
"RORY: As long as it's a liquor store in town, neighbor."
"[Rory walks over to a table where people are telling stories about Louie]"
"SY: So, like I say, it's Halloween, right, and we're lucky Louie doesn't have razor wire around his yard, you know how he is. So finally one of the neighborhood kids, he gets all courageous and he goes sauntering up to the door and he goes trick or treat!' Louie finally throws the door open, looks at him and says, Did you get a Reese's cup tonight?' And the kid looks in his bag and he says, Yes sir, I did.' So Louie grabs it, says thank you very much!,' then slams the door in his face."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry I never met him."
"LUKE: He was colorful."
"KIRK: I never trick or treated again."
"MISS PATTY: So one day I'm at the post office, I'm in line when Louie just about knocks me over and he cuts in line. I said, Louie, there's a line!' So he says, Kiss my butt!' and I said, You mind your manners!' and he says, Please kiss my butt!' and drops his pants!"
"BABETTE: Oh, I got one, I got one. Louie was parked outside Al's Pancake World, and I was trying to pull in the space behind him, when all of a sudden, he starts to back up, so I honk my horn and he  it was just a little honk, no big deal  but he . . ."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are sitting at the table staring at the food.]"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: We're starving."
"EMILY: We're waiting for your father."
"LORELAI: It's gonna get cold."
"EMILY: We are waiting for your father."
"LORELAI: We've been waiting forever."
"EMILY: We have not been waiting forever."
"LORELAI: Forever. Godot was just here. He said I ain't waiting for Richard,' grabbed a roll, and left. It's been forever."
"EMILY: When we gather as a family, we eat as a family. We don't eat in shifts  you know that and Richard certainly knows that."
"RORY: When did he get that antique car anyhow?"
"EMILY: A couple of horrible weeks ago."
"LORELAI: What happened to the oil painting hobby of his?"
"EMILY: Ah, you know your father. When he couldn't foresee rivaling Cezanne, he lost interest so he bought that car. Lorelai!"
"[Lorelai spits out the piece of candy she was about to eat]"
"LORELAI: Mom, it's not dinner, it's just my private stash."
"EMILY: It's eating and we're not eating."
"LORELAI: You know, you're bound by the rules of the Geneva Convention, Mother, just like everyone else. Hey, no one told me it was casual Friday."
"RICHARD: Hello everyone. You haven't started?"
"EMILY: Of course we haven't started, we were waiting for you. I thought you were almost done."
"RICHARD: Well, I was but this car has a mind of its own. As I turned to leave it began spraying some sort of green solution at me."
"RORY: Yuck."
"RICHARD: Yuck, indeed. Well, go on, start."
"LORELAI: Ooh!"
"RICHARD: No sense in waiting for me."
"LORELAI: Coolness!"
"EMILY: Stop!"
"LORELAI: Gomer said!"
"EMILY: We are waiting for you, Richard. In thirtyfive years, I have never ever started a dinner without you unless you were out of town or seriously ill. Elsa, take everything away and keep it warm! Now please go upstairs and get ready so we can all enjoy a nice family dinner. . .together."
"RICHARD: I'll be right back."
"LORELAI: Right back, Dad, like right back. In fact, change on the way upstairs. And make it a Navy shower  quick soap, quick rinse and no excessive posing! Hungry."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory and Lorelai walk through the door]"
"LORELAI: Hey there. Anywhere?"
"LUKE: Anywhere you want."
"LORELAI: Could you move please?"
"CUSTOMER: What?"
"LUKE: Anywhere where there's not people."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, like I'm a mind reader. I was just joking. Hmm, that's funny."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Something's different here, something's changed."
"RORY: Impossible."
"LORELAI: No, I swear, there's something."
"RORY: You know, I'd be very disappointed if something changed in here."
"LORELAI: Why are you so anti-change?"
"RORY: Because most change sucks."
"LORELAI: That's true, it does. Uh! The chalkboard!"
"RORY: What about it?"
"LORELAI: Luke's special omelet. That is brand new."
"RORY: A new special? His four-slice French toast has been up there since I was born!"
"LORELAI: You just gotta let that go, baby."
"LUKE: What can I get you?"
"LORELAI: You have a new special."
"LUKE: I sure do."
"LORELAI: Nice. What is the special omelet?"
"LUKE: You won't like it."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"LUKE: Because you've been eating here for years and I know what you like, and you won't like it."
"LORELAI: Can I at least hear what it is?"
"LUKE: Fine. It's three eggs with bits of bacon."
"LORELAI: I like bacon."
"LUKE: Cubed tomatoes."
"LORELAI: Sounds good."
"LUKE: Swiss cheese and a dash of oregano."
"LORELAI: A dash, he says."
"LUKE: I've got other customers here."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna go with the special omelet."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: With a side of bacon."
"LUKE: There's bacon in the omelet."
"LORELAI: Oh, then skip the bacon."
"LUKE: The side of bacon?"
"LORELAI: The bacon in the omelet."
"LUKE: Hold the bacon."
"LORELAI: Can I get Jack cheese?"
"LUKE: On the side?"
"LORELAI: Instead of Swiss, Swiss is so stringy."
"LUKE: Fine, Jack cheese."
"LORELAI: Also, I think I'm allergic to oregano so hold that, too, and some coffee."
"LUKE: So, just the eggs, tomatoes, and Jack cheese."
"LORELAI: Not too many tomatoes."
"LUKE: Light on the tomatoes."
"LORELAI: Very light, just a teeny-tiny amount, practically none."
"LUKE: I'm skipping the tomatoes. It's an omelet with Jack cheese."
"LORELAI: Perfect."
"LUKE: You did this on purpose."
"LORELAI: Did what?"
"RORY: French toast for me. That was cruel."
"LORELAI: I know. Look how hard he worked on that sign and everything. Look at the handwriting, it's so precise, so determined. It's focused-Luke."
"RORY: That's Jess' handwriting."
"LORELAI: Really? How do you know Jess' writing?"
"RORY: Oh, well, I lent him a book and he wrote some stuff in it."
"LORELAI: He vandalized one of your books?"
"RORY: No, he didn't vandalize it. He wrote in the margins, thoughts and stuff."
"LORELAI: Like what, like play basketball, eat a sandwich  stuff like that?"
"RORY: No, stuff, like margin stuff. People like Mark Twain wrote in margins."
"LORELAI: Pilot a steamboat, write Huckleberry Finn?"
"RORY: Forget it."
"LORELAI: No, no, I'm sure margin writing is very common. Oh, hey, you didn't tell me Dean was joining us."
"RORY: Dean?"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"DEAN: Hi."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"DEAN: I just dropped by to say hello."
"RORY: How'd you know we were here?"
"DEAN: Cause you're always here."
"RORY: We're not always here."
"LORELAI: Uh, do you wanna eat with us, Dean?"
"DEAN: Rory?"
"RORY: Huh?"
"DEAN: Is that okay?"
"RORY: Yes. Oh, yes, you don't have to ask."
"LORELAI: Hey, we're three."
"LUKE: I did the math. You gonna eat something?"
"DEAN: Sure, yeah, I'll take the special omelet, I guess."
"LUKE: You put him up to this?"
"LORELAI: No, I did not!"
"LUKE: Sure. You don't even know what's in it."
"DEAN: I'm not picky."
"LUKE: So you'll send it back after I make it?"
"DEAN: No."
"LUKE: Right. I'll come back when I've got time for this."
"DEAN: What was that all about?"
"LORELAI: I think it was a little something in your attitude, mister."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"[The students are sitting in several separate groups around the classroom]"
"RORY: So is everything in the materials clear to everyone?"
"CHIP: Pretty much."
"LOUISE: Oh, were we reading these now?"
"RORY: Yeah, that's why we've all been kind of quiet for the past ten minutes."
"LOUISE: I thought it was, like, prayer time or something."
"PARIS: Good grief."
"MADELINE: I'm still reading mine."
"PARIS: What?"
"MADELINE: I read slow so I don't miss anything."
"PARIS: It's not the Bhagavad Gita, Madeline. It's simple instructions for the business fair."
"LOUISE: Someone's not taking to Elba too kindly."
"PARIS: What does that mean?"
"LOUISE: Just that Rory's the leader of this group, Napoleon, and you're not."
"PARIS: Excuse me, leader? You wanna lead here, you've got anarchy."
"RORY: I'm just enjoying the show."
"BRAD: Hi, I think this is my group."
"RORY: Brad, hey."
"BRAD: Oh, you remember me."
"RORY: Of course I do."
"BRAD: Cool."
"RORY: So you're back at Chilton now?"
"BRAD: Oh, yeah. My psychiatrist convinced my parents that I should face my fears instead of running away from them and my rabbi agreed, so here I am."
"RORY: Well, nice to have you back. Take a seat."
"BRAD: Paris. Her name is Paris, right?"
"RORY: Brad, let me catch you up here. There's going to be an intra-school business fair in three weeks. Each group has to come up with a consumer product that's geared toward high school kids."
"BRAD: Neat."
"RORY: So we pick our product and we make a prototype of it, then we use our imaginary million dollar budget to mass produce, market, and distribute it, and we'll present all of this at the fair."
"BRAD: Cool."
"PARIS: Hey Brad? Your festive interjections are a real kick in the pants, but we're low on time, so can it."
"RORY: That's it. In two days we're going to reconvene and pitch product ideas."
"LOUISE: Class dismissed?"
"PARIS: Whoa whoa whoa, we haven't even discussed business advisors."
"RORY: Right. We're supposed to get a parent who's in business to advise us. Anyone score?"
"CHIP: My dad's got scheduling conflicts up the wazoo."
"RORY: No for Chip."
"PARIS: My dad's in Hong Kong for the month but he can video-conference in if need be."
"RORY: No for Paris."
"MADELINE: My dad's traveling."
"LOUISE: My dad's in court for the next six weeks."
"RORY: Lawyer?"
"LOUISE: Defendant."
"RORY: We won't pry."
"LOUISE: I have no idea what he's up on anyway."
"RORY: And no one's mom works?"
"MADELINE: Working moms are so nineties."
"BRAD: My mom works. She's a curator at the Hartford Natural Museum."
"PARIS: We need experienced business advisors, Brad  not someone who poses animal carcasses."
"MADELINE: What about your mom?"
"RORY: My mom?"
"PARIS: Yeah, that's right. She runs a hotel."
"RORY: It's just an inn, a small inn."
"MADELINE: It's still a business."
"CHIP: She must keep books and stuff, right?"
"RORY: Yeah, but they're really small books."
"PARIS: Look, it's not perfect but it's a better option than Brad's mom, the buffalo stuffer."
"BRAD: She doesn't stuff the animals. That's taxidermy."
"PARIS: Who is this rabbi that encouraged you to come back here? Give me his address, I'm gonna go over there and pop him one."
"RORY: Okay, hold it. Now, I don't think my mom is right for this."
"PARIS: Well, she's all we've got so you need to do whatever it takes to make it happen, otherwise maybe you shouldn't be the group leader."
"LOUISE: A coup d'état, how exciting."
"RORY: There's no coup d'état. I'll ask her."
"PARIS: Good."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie is stirring a bowl of meringue as Lorelai walks in with a box]"
"SOOKIE: Thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two. . ."
"LORELAI: Sookie, look!"
"SOOKIE: Thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, can't look, I'm making meringue, thirty-seven, fine science."
"LORELAI: You got a package!"
"SOOKIE: Thirty-nine, gotta count, forty, can't over-whip."
"LORELAI: I think it's your wedding invitations!"
"SOOKIE: Whoooooo! Gimme it! Ohh, I wanna see them! Oh, you're gonna love these. They're pearly white with this beautiful lavender stripe - . . ."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna choke somebody by the neck until brains ooze out of their ears."
"LORELAI: What, they're beautiful."
"SOOKIE: The name, look at the name."
"LORELAI: The marriage of his daughter. . ."
"BOTH: Susie St. James."
"SOOKIE: Who is Susie St. James?"
"LORELAI: I think it's you."
"SOOKIE: What am I gonna do?"
"LORELAI: It can be changed."
"SOOKIE: No, and these have to go out in a week."
"LORELAI: We're calling right now."
"SOOKIE: I am so not a Susie."
"MICHEL: Good morning, beautiful morning."
"SOOKIE: It sucks from where I'm sitting."
"MICHEL: Heartbreak. Lorelai, do you remember I have tomorrow afternoon off?"
"LORELAI: I remember, big plans?"
"MICHEL: Yes, my mother is coming to visit."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hello, yes, customer service please, thanks. [To Michel] Sorry."
"MICHEL: About what?"
"LORELAI: You said your mother's coming for a visit."
"MICHEL: But I'm excited, I never get to see her."
"LORELAI: Oh, I must be projecting. Your mother's coming for a visit!"
"MICHEL: She's coming down for three days."
"LORELAI: Is she staying here?"
"MICHEL: No. She stays with me, of course."
"LORELAI: In your tiny place?"
"MICHEL: Oh, she's fine with it. I mean, we stay up all night gabbing and watching movies. We have a ball."
"LORELAI: Wow, I can't wait to meet her. [on phone] Oh, hello. Yes, we have a problem with some wedding invitations we ordered. Okay. [to Sookie] They're transferring me."
"SOOKIE: I heard that."
"LORELAI: He's really happy about his mother coming to visit."
"SOOKIE: I heard that, too."
"LORELAI: Totally foreign to me. [on phone] Hi. Oh great, I'm gonna pass you over to my friend who has a problem with some merchandise she ordered. Hold on one sec. [to Sookie] Listen to me, I've had a lot of experience dealing with people who have screwed something up. You have a better chance of getting them to help you if you don't get all hysterical."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"SOOKIE: [on phone] How dare you do this to me! You're ruining my wedding! It's the most important day of my life! It's my life, it's not Susie St. James, are you listening to me?"
"LORELAI: Good girl."
"SOOKIE: You better be listening to me! Do you  look, no, you be quiet, listen!"
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[Lorelai walks out of the kitchen as Rory walks into the inn]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Oh, hi. Thought you couldn't get here til later."
"RORY: Our Franklin meeting didn't go as long as I thought it would."
"LORELAI: Well, lucky for me, more work for you. Here, chronological order, please. So how was your day?"
"RORY: I got an A on my physics test."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"RORY: And I finished Candide and I convinced a boy that Paris would probably never attack his rabbi."
"LORELAI: So uneventful, huh?"
"RORY: Pretty much. Mom, um, I know you're probably not gonna wanna do this."
"LORELAI: Yes, I will. . .unless it's something that I don't wanna do."
"RORY: Do you wanna be the parent advisor on my economics project?"
"LORELAI: Ooh, Rory, gosh."
"RORY: I'm kind of in a spot."
"LORELAI: No one else can do it?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: You checked?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: You double checked?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: And no one else can do it so you came slumming after me and I'm your last choice?"
"RORY: Of course."
"LORELAI: I appreciate that."
"RORY: I'm totally stuck."
"LORELAI: Well, if you're stuck, I'll do it."
"RORY: Thanks."
"LORELAI: But  ooh, hey, what about your grandfather, retired business titan?"
"RORY: What about him?"
"LORELAI: He'd be perfect."
"RORY: But this is a business project and the word business has been kind of taboo in that house since he left the firm. Asking him might remind him of that and upset him."
"LORELAI: Or he'll be thrilled that you thought of him."
"RORY: Hm, you're not just saying that because you don't wanna do it?"
"LORELAI: No, I really think he would enjoy helping you. You would be doing me a big favor cause then I wouldn't have to feel guilty about being so reluctant to help you out myself."
"RORY: All right, I'll give it a sh*t."
"LORELAI: Good girl."
"RORY: Would you really have felt guilty?"
"LORELAI: No, but I would've felt guilty about not feeling guilty and you can see how that could just go on forever."
"RORY: Miss Gilmore and the vicious circle."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Richard is outside working on his antique car as Rory walks up to him]"
"RORY: Hey Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Rory, this is a surprise."
"RORY: I was just in the area and I thought I'd pay a call."
"RICHARD: Well, how very continental of you. I would hug you, but I have various forms of viscous fluid on my clothing."
"RORY: I'll take a rain check."
"RICHARD: Very good."
"RORY: How's she running?"
"RICHARD: Ah, she's a bit, oh, obstinate today."
"RORY: Well, girls can get that way."
"RICHARD: Mm, indeed. So you were in the neighborhood?"
"RORY: Yeah, and I actually have a little favor to ask you, if it's okay."
"RICHARD: Oh, ask away."
"RORY: Okay. There's this project at school and, uh, it's for my economics class."
"RICHARD: Good subject, pragmatic."
"RORY: Yeah, and we have to come up with a consumer product, all make believe, and there's sort of a contest at the end and we sort of need an advisor."
"RICHARD: An advisor?"
"RORY: Yeah, someone who's experienced in business who can come to a few meetings, make suggestions. I mean, I totally understand if you can't do it, but I just thought I would ask."
"RICHARD: Well, I'm not sure how much help I could be. I've never actually created a consumer product."
"RORY: That's okay, we kids haven't either."
"RICHARD: Yes, I suppose you haven't."
"RORY: If you can't do it or if you don't wanna do it, I totally understand."
"RICHARD: Well, things are a little bit hectic right now."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, I know."
"RICHARD: And it is short notice, after all."
"RORY: Very short, very short. Um, you know what, forget I even asked."
"EMILY: Rory, I didn't know you were here!"
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: You didn't hug your grandfather, did you?"
"RORY: I took a rain check. Well, I better go."
"EMILY: But you just got here. We have cookies, would you like cookies?"
"RORY: No, thank you. Mom's expecting me at the inn. And Grandpa, really, don't worry about it. I just thought I would ask."
"RICHARD: I'm fine, Rory. Thank you for asking."
"RORY: Bye. [leaves]"
"EMILY: Ask what, what did she ask?"
"RICHARD: Oh, something for her economics class. It's nothing really."
"EMILY: That doesn't sound like nothing. What about her economics class? Is she having trouble?"
"RICHARD: No, Emily. She merely asked me to participate in some, uh, project at school and I respectfully declined."
"EMILY: You declined?"
"RICHARD: Leave it, Emily."
"EMILY: Why did you decline?"
"RICHARD: Let's talk about it later, Emily. I'm busy."
"EMILY: Busy? You've been poking around that stupid engine for the last three weeks and all it does is spray at you. You're not too busy."
"RICHARD: Emily, I am in the middle of something here and I don't expect you to understand it."
"EMILY: You're not going to help her?"
"RICHARD: Can we talk about this later?"
"EMILY: Well, I never thought I'd see the day."
"RICHARD: What day?"
"EMILY: The day Richard Gilmore would disappoint his granddaughter like this."
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily, please."
"EMILY: So, tell me Richard, is this how it's going to be from now on?"
"RICHARD: What are you talking about?"
"EMILY: I just want to know what to expect from you. Because the bouncing from one thing to another, the moping and silence in your den for days, all of that I accepted. . .but your turning your back on Rory!"
"RICHARD: I did not turn my back on her."
"EMILY: You adore that little girl, she means everything to you, remember?"
"RICHARD: Emily!"
"EMILY: Are you that lost? I'm incredibly disappointed in you Richard!"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"LANE: Sales!"
"RORY: Lane."
"LANE: Sales!"
"RORY: It's just a stupid test."
"LANE: Lane Kim, you have shown a genuine aptitude for sales."
"RORY: It doesn't mean anything."
"LANE: Hello ma'am, I see you're eyeing the Whip-o-Matic, nice choice! This baby's right off the truck, and let me tell you, if you're looking for something to fulfill all your whipping needs, you've come to the right place because as Devo says  if a problem comes along you must whip it, as long as you whip it with a Whip-o-Matic!"
"RORY: Wow, you are good."
"LANE: Stop it."
"RORY: I'll take two."
"LANE: I don't wanna be in sales!"
"RORY: You don't have to be."
"LANE: I wanna do something cool."
"RORY: Sell refrigerators."
"LANE: You are not funny."
"RORY: Look, you are taking this aptitude test way too seriously."
"LANE: It's the fourth time I've taken it and it's the fourth time it's come up sales."
"RORY: Lane, in ten years, we will be having lunch in Paris and we will not be discussing whether or not you made your quota."
"LANE: Right, so I'm gonna be a sucky salesman?"
"RORY: Changing subject now."
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Oh, hey."
"DEAN: How are ya, Lane?"
"LANE: Only as good as my last sale, Dean."
"RORY: Ignore her, she's lost her mind."
"DEAN: Got it. So, uh, what are you doing?"
"RORY: We're going over to Sissy's to buy some shoes."
"LANE: And pick up a job application."
"RORY: You will now face the wall quietly please."
"DEAN: Well, after you're done shoe shopping, come by my softball game."
"RORY: Oh, well  ."
"DEAN: You haven't been to a game in awhile."
"RORY: I know, but  ."
"DEAN: You said you missed seeing them."
"RORY: I do, but I thought we were getting together tonight."
"DEAN: We are."
"RORY: Well, then I should really get my philosophy homework out of the way."
"DEAN: Do it at the game."
"RORY: My homework?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"RORY: But if I'm doing my homework, doesn't that defeat the point of going to see you play?"
"DEAN: You can't glance up in between nihilistic theories?"
"RORY: I can, but what's the point?"
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: Why don't I do my homework at home and I will go see you play next week."
"DEAN: Well, I  ."
"RORY: I promise I'll be there."
"DEAN: Okay, sure."
"RORY: Great, so, tonight?"
"DEAN: Yeah, I'll be by at seven."
"RORY: Okay. So, have a good game. Do that pointing to the outfield thing, that's always very popular."
"DEAN: I will. Bye Lane."
"LANE: Come again soon."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[At the front desk, Michel is giving Lorelai some papers to sign.]"
"MICHEL: Here and here."
"LORELAI: What  ."
"MICHEL: Cleaning supply order. Here."
"LORELAI: That's the  ."
"MICHEL: Staff insurance forms. Initial here, date it here."
"LORELAI: And I just  ."
"MICHEL: You just okayed the vaccination of all those filthy ducks in the south pond."
"LORELAI: Oh, aren't I nice."
"MICHEL: Yes, a regular Dr. Dolittle."
"[Michel's mother walks into the inn]"
"GISELLE: Uh! Michel!"
"MICHEL: Zeelee!"
"GISELLE: Ah! Mon dieu, you are gorgeous! Come, come! Embrassez maman!"
"MICHEL: Maman, j'aime ton visite. What are you doing here? I was going to pick you up at the airport, you wicked creature."
"GISELLE: I had to come early. I wanted to buy presents before I see you since I know you are a materialistic vulture. All right, back up. Turn turn turn. Thank God I have the perfect son. If you had been ugly, I don't know what I would've done."
"MICHEL: Boarding school?"
"GISELLE: In Switzerland."
"MICHEL: Come. Lorelai, this is my mother, Giselle."
"LORELAI: Well, it's very nice to meet you."
"GISELLE: Oh my God, those eyes. Are they real?"
"LORELAI: Yes, they are."
"GISELLE: Well, then, if there's a God, he is terribly cruel to bestow those eyes and that face to one person."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, can you be my mom, too?"
"MICHEL: I'm going to show her around, okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, make sure you see Sookie."
"MICHEL: Why?"
"LORELAI: Sookie wants to meet your mom."
"GISELLE: Yes, Michel, I must meet your friends. I did not raise you to be rude."
"MICHEL: You did, too."
"GISELLE: I did, didn't I? Come, show me off."
"MICHEL: Oh, have you been using those free weights I sent you?"
"GISELLE: Yes, they hold down my papers beautifully."
"MICHEL: A lazy, silly woman."
"GISELLE: A cruel and vicious boy, I'm so proud."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory and Richard walk down the hall toward a classroom]"
"RORY: I really appreciate you doing this, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Oh, well, of course."
"RORY: I mean, I know you weren't really thrilled with the idea."
"RICHARD: No, no, no, no, that's not true."
"RORY: But I told everybody to have their idea pitches prepared so that we can get you in and out of there as quickly as possible."
"RICHARD: Rory, this is an assignment. We will give it the time that it requires."
"RORY: Okay."
"RICHARD: However, efficient is always best."
"RORY: I totally understand."
"[they walk into the classroom]"
"RORY: Hey. Everyone, this is my grandfather, Richard Gilmore. This is Louise, Madeline, Paris, Brad, and Chip."
"RICHARD: Nice to meet you all."
"RORY: So, do you wanna say a few words before we start?"
"RICHARD: Uh, oh, no no no, I'm here to advise. I'll uh. . .I'll sit back here and observe and advise, uh, if necessary."
"RORY: Okay. So I guess we can start with the idea pitches. Who wants to go first?"
"LOUISE: I will."
"RORY: Okay, Louise has the floor."
"LOUISE: I couldn't find my new lip gloss this morning. I had just bought it and it's the perfect shade of pink. Plus, it has this major shine with minor stickiness, meaning no fear of your hair attaching itself to your face when the wind kicks up."
"MADELINE: A coup."
"LOUISE: I know. So, of course, fifteen minutes later, tardy and glossless, I left the house and I had to rely on Madeline for my source of lip color for the day. Not an ideal solution."
"MADELINE: Major skin tone mismatch."
"PARIS: I'm sorry, group leader, could you ask the Pigeon sisters if there is a point to this opus?"
"RORY: Louise, what's your idea?"
"LOUISE: A lipstick Lo-Jack."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"LOUISE: A lipstick tracking device. You attach it to a tube and you hook it up to a remote and next time you're searching, you just point and sh**t."
"MADELINE: I'd buy one."
"RORY: Okay, um, Louise, that's a very interesting idea, but I think we should think of something that appeals to both boys and girls. Anyone else?"
"MADELINE: Okay, I've got one  a locker robot. It would talk and tell you facts, help you with your homework, carry your stuff. And you could fit it in your locker until you're ready to go home."
"RORY: Okay, but that means that we would actually have to build a robot."
"MADELINE: Yes, we would."
"RORY: Who knows how to do that?"
"MADELINE: I don't know. He looks like he should know."
"BRAD: I've never built a robot."
"LOUISE: But you've tried, haven't you?"
"BRAD: Yes, I have."
"RORY: Okay, let's just try to keep the ideas down to things that we can actually accomplish. And I guess Paris is next."
"PARIS: The average teenager spends seven hours a day at school. Seven hours where he or she is busy walking from class to class  indoors, outdoors, in all types of weather. At the same time, that same teenager is going through major physical changes within his or her own body. The combo of the action with the environment in addition to the hormonal imbalance can only lead to one thing  accidents."
"MADELINE: What are you talking about?"
"PARIS: Monday morning, Muffin wakes up and looks in the mirror. Oh no, I have a zit on my face. I'll just look down when I walk so hunky football player won't notice.' And bam  Muffin smacks right into the cafeteria wall. Ouch, that's gotta hurt."
"MADELINE: Who's Muffin?"
"PARIS: This is why I'm proposing manufacturing something that no teenager should be without  a first aid kit."
"LOUISE: A first aid kit?"
"PARIS: Specially designed to fit in a locker with minimum space disruption. Bandaids, antiseptic, cotton balls, q-tips, ace bandages, aspirin."
"RORY: I don't know, it's possible. Does anyone have any questions about it?"
"RICHARD: They sell these things in every drug store, do they not?"
"PARIS: Yes, they do."
"RICHARD: There's also a registered nurse on every campus. Her office would contain the products that you're talking about, correct?"
"PARIS: Possibly."
"RICHARD: Well, what makes you think you can get a young person to spend good money on something that they could get for free, or at least at a lower cost?"
"PARIS: Because I know one thing about the modern teenager."
"RICHARD: And what is that?"
"PARIS: That you can get them to buy anything as long as it comes in a leopard print."
"LOUISE: True."
"MADELINE: Very true."
"PARIS: We get them with style. We dress up the kits with sparkles, colors, pictures of bands. Sport themes for the boys, animal pictures for the puppy and unicorn bunch, chess boards for the Bobby Fischer freaks  a style for every taste. Plus, we use neon bandaids, pink or blue gauze for the bandages, anything that seems young or flashy or bright."
"RICHARD: And that is how you intend to set the business world on its ear?"
"PARIS: That's right."
"RICHARD: Tricked out first aid kits?"
"PARIS: For the locker."
"RICHARD: And you really think that's going to work?"
"PARIS: Yes, I do."
"RICHARD: So do I."
"PARIS: Really?"
"RICHARD: It's perfect. It's simple, it's easy to produce, the possibilities are endless. I love it."
"RORY: Well, I think we've got our product."
"RICHARD: Now, we need to go through this point by point."
"PARIS: Okay, let's do it."
"RICHARD: Now, the secret to a great campaign is a great idea. Now, we've got that, let's move on to finances. Um, uh, do any of you have dinner plans, because we're gonna be here for awhile. Let's all turn to page four. Here we go. Now, the January projections. . ."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch reading as Rory walks through the front door. The phone is ringing]"
"LORELAI: Agh!"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Gah!"
"RORY: Mom! [answers phone] Hello? [hangs up] That ringing is not in your head, you know."
"LORELAI: Uh, you've gotta read this Motley Crue book. I swear, you get to the point where Ozzy Osbourne snorts a row of ants and you think, it cannot get any grosser, and then you turn the page and oh, hello, yes it can! It's excellent!"
"RORY: Why didn't you answer the phone?"
"LORELAI: Because I firmly believe that once you've experienced something five thousand times, you need to move on."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: I knew who it was."
"RORY: Who was it?"
"LORELAI: The same person who's called the machine so many times now that I actually heard it sigh."
"RORY: Dean?"
"LORELAI: Dean the determined."
"RORY: Oh man."
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Five bucks says I know who that is."
"RORY: [answers phone] Hello?"
"RICHARD: Rory, it's your grandfather."
"RORY: Oh, hey Grandpa."
"LORELAI: He did that on purpose."
"RICHARD: I'd like to discuss tomorrow's meeting."
"RORY: Okay."
"RICHARD: I was thinking that we should relocate."
"RORY: Midtown?"
"RICHARD: Here."
"RORY: Your house?"
"RICHARD: It'll be more comfortable with infinitely better snacks."
"RORY: Yeah, that sounds great."
"RICHARD: Wonderful. I'll call the group."
"RORY: Okay, well, then I guess I'll see you tomorrow."
"RICHARD: Tomorrow."
"RORY: Bye. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: What'd he want?"
"RORY: He wanted to move the location of our meeting to his house tomorrow and to cost you five bucks."
"LORELAI: So that's going well, huh, Grandpa doing that thing with you at school?"
"RORY: Yeah, I think he's having fun with it."
"LORELAI: See? Did your brilliant mother call it or what?"
"RORY: Yes, she did."
"LORELAI: You're damn lucky to have that magnificent woman in your life, you know that, don't you?"
"RORY: It's whispered in my ear every night when I'm about to go to sleep."
"LORELAI: Well, you won't let me write it in your underwear anymore. Hey, check the machine so I can erase the messages."
"RORY: Oh, right."
"LORELAI: Agh!"
"DEAN: [on answering machine] Hey, it's me. Uh, it's four o'clock, call me when you got home. [beep] Hey, uh, it's four thirty. I'm home, call me. [beep] It's quarter to five  where are you? I'll try paging you. [beep] It's five-thirty. Did you get my page? Call with the answer."
"RORY: They are not all from him."
"DEAN: [on answering machine] Hey, I totally forgot you were getting home at six."
"LORELAI: And yet, oddly, even after remembering that information. . ."
"DEAN: [on answering machine] Hey, it's five forty-five and I just thought I'd see if you got home early."
"LORELAI: I swear, that boy would make a good drinking game."
"RORY: This is crazy. Ten messages?"
"LORELAI: Plus the four that I took from him personally before I stopped answering the phone."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: Honey, you gotta ease up on that love potion you've been giving him or he's gonna start showing up at David Letterman's house soon."
"RORY: Ugh."
"LORELAI: What's the matter?"
"RORY: Fourteen messages."
"LORELAI: Yeah, so, it's a little  ."
"RORY: It's a little too much."
"LORELAI: So, what's up? Are you guys fighting or something?"
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: I mean, did something happen to set off the phone craze?"
"RORY: No, everything's been fine, everything's been calm. No more incidents, I don't get it."
"LORELAI: Well, if I had to guess, I would say he's feeling a little insecure about something."
"RORY: But why?"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: But I spend every free moment with him, I call him, I page him."
"LORELAI: I know, you've been good."
"RORY: And nothing seems to be enough, nothing seems to make things normal again."
"LORELAI: Give it some time."
"RORY: I just want things to be the way they were."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, relationships are hard. Sometimes you go through a weird patch and things get funky for a little while, but just give it a chance. Ride it out, things will calm down again."
"RORY: I hope so. I'm gonna erase the messages."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is at the front desk as Michel and his mother walk into the inn laughing]"
"GISELLE: Oh, stop it, stop making me laugh! You are trying to k*ll me! You are trying to make your mother laugh herself to death so you can get away with a grisly crime."
"MICHEL: Your mind is evil."
"GISELLE: Your soul is empty."
"MICHEL: You want some coffee, Zeelee?"
"GISELLE: Yes, darling, thank you."
"MICHEL: I'll be right back."
"GISELLE: Ah, hello, blue eyes."
"LORELAI: Hi Giselle. How was lunch?"
"GISELLE: Ah, champagne, caviar, the usual."
"LORELAI: Ah, sure."
"GISELLE: And then came out the pasta with terrible things in it. It was perfect."
"LORELAI: You seem to be having a wonderful time."
"GISELLE: I am. I will miss him so much when I go home, but thank goodness, he will have an extra five pounds to remember me by after eating all my pasta today, that dirty thieving boy."
"LORELAI: Michel ate pasta?"
"GISELLE: Well, yes. Michel loves pasta, he eats it all the time."
"LORELAI: Not around us. Here it's all no-carb, low-cal, let me see if I can eat less than the lab rats do."
"GISELLE: Lab rats?"
"LORELAI: Better not explained. Anyway, I'm glad you've got him eating pasta, he seems really happy."
"MICHEL: Coffee, coffee, coffee."
"GISELLE: Oh, mm, mm. This is horrible."
"MICHEL: You will drink it and you will like it."
"GISELLE: You are a curse."
"MICHEL: Let's go shop."
"GISELLE: Oh yes, let's go buy something completely useless and pay way too much money for it."
"MICHEL: I love it."
"GISELLE: Au revoir."
"MICHEL: Au revoir."
"LORELAI: That is so wrong."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Rory, Louise, Madeline, Brad and Chip walk to the front door]"
"RORY: We should've waited for Paris."
"LOUISE: Hey, she's the one who threw a fit about leaving no later than 3:10."
"RORY: But she could be standing outside the school right now waiting for us."
"MADELINE: She has my cell number."
"LOUISE: I thought you lost your phone."
"MADELINE: I did. Oh."
"RORY: We'll call her when we get inside. [rings doorbell]"
"BRAD: Tell her I wanted to wait, okay?"
"[Paris answers the door]"
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Hey, you're right on time. Come on in."
"RORY: Uh, okay."
"RICHARD: In the dining room, everyone."
"RORY: Wow."
"RICHARD: Welcome, everyone, to the first official board meeting of the StyleAid Corporation. Will everyone please take a seat?"
"CHIP: I feel like Ivan Bosky."
"RICHARD: Rory, you are group leader which translates into chairman of the board, which means you sit at the head of the table."
"RORY: But that's where you sit."
"RICHARD: No, not today. Come on. Now, at this point, I would like to turn the meeting over to Paris who will bring us up to date on our latest developments."
"PARIS: Thank you, Richard. First, let me say that I'm glad to see you all here today, at the beginning of what I think is going to be a very exciting experiment."
"BRAD: She doesn't have a baseball bat in her hands, does she?"
"PARIS: Now, I'd like everyone to turn to page one in your presentation booklets. Hey, we haven't gotten to the pencil part yet."
"BRAD: Oh, sorry."
"PARIS: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the RX-2002."
"LOUISE: Nice."
"RORY: Very nice."
"PARIS: Now, listed in front of you are all the contents contained in the RX-2002, plus the additional style options, twelve in all. Every one of them waterproof, fireproof, and comes with a five-year warranty."
"RICHARD: Which is longer than most of your high school careers."
"PARIS: He is funny."
"RICHARD: Now there is also a deluxe model with extra features designed to personalize your kit even more specifically for your needs. There will be a snap-in CD case which can hold up to ten CDs, there's a lighted vanity mirror, and a divided compartment for makeup and knickknacks. A picture frame and a hidden mini vault for valuables which can be locked for safety."
"PARIS: Terrific idea, Richard, really  top notch."
"RICHARD: Thank you, Paris."
"RORY: This is really amazing. I want one of these."
"RICHARD: Exactly the point. Now, let's check in with our marketing department. Uh, Madeline, Louise  what have you got for us?"
"MADELINE: Okay, well, first we go for the obvious  magazines."
"LOUISE: You know, Teen, Young Miss, Seventeen."
"MADELINE: Spin and Rolling Stone, especially to hit the guys."
"RICHARD: I hear that Jane magazine also has a young, hip following."
"RORY: How do you know about Jane magazine?"
"RICHARD: I have my ways, young lady."
"CHIP: We should also check about placing them in certain mall stores."
"RICHARD: I also think we should go straight to the source."
"PARIS: The schools?"
"RICHARD: Why not? School bulletin boards, websites. We can set up tables at football games and pep rallies."
"EMILY: Well, how is everyone doing here?"
"RICHARD: Just fine, Emily."
"EMILY: Good. Is there enough food?"
"RICHARD: Yes, there is plenty of food."
"EMILY: What about ice cream? Would anyone like some ice cream?"
"RICHARD: Emily, we're in the middle of a business meeting."
"EMILY: Oh, ah, well, I'm very sorry. Uh, go back to your business meeting."
"RICHARD: Now, I think your projections for. . ."
"EMILY: [to Rory] He's smiling."
"RORY: I know."
"EMILY: He's smiling and there's no oil on the carpet."
"RORY: Life is good."
"EMILY: Yes, it is."
"RICHARD: Emily, please."
"EMILY: I'm going, I'm going."
"PARIS: Richard, do you have the third-year projections?"
"RICHARD: Well, yes, Paris, I do. I have them right here."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai pulls up to the house. Dean is washing Rory's car.]"
"LORELAI: Dean."
"DEAN: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey, how's it going?"
"DEAN: Uh, just washing Rory's car."
"LORELAI: I can see that."
"DEAN: Well, I mean, I came by to see her and she wasn't here, so I was just gonna wait on the porch but then I noticed that her car looked dirty, so I thought I'd wash it."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"DEAN: Well, cause sometimes things can get on your car like dirt and certain kinds of sap. It can get into your paint, makes it really hard to get off."
"LORELAI: Sure."
"DEAN: Even water spots, you know. . .after it rains, that can be a real problem."
"LORELAI: Okay. Would you like a soda?"
"DEAN: No, I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Let's go get a soda."
"DEAN: But I have to wash  ."
"LORELAI: Put the squirty water thing down and come on in the kitchen. Squirty thing down. . . that's it. . .come on."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Dean and Lorelai walk through the back door]"
"DEAN: Look, I really didn't mean to bother you. I can just wait outside until Rory gets home."
"LORELAI: Honey, Rory's working on her school project today."
"DEAN: Oh yeah. I guess I forgot. I mean, she must've told me that she . . . I'm sorry, I forgot."
"LORELAI: That's okay."
"DEAN: So, I'll just go."
"LORELAI: No no, come here, just sit down for a sec, okay? Are you all right?"
"DEAN: Yeah, I'm fine. I just don't remember Rory telling me about her studying today. I swear I wouldn't have come over."
"LORELAI: Can I maybe give you a little advice?"
"DEAN: Sure."
"LORELAI: Okay. First, I just wanna tell you I think you are a great guy. You're so good to Rory. And even though I'd always hoped that she'd be the one girl in the world who wouldn't look at a boy until she was thirty-eight, I'm really glad she found you."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"LORELAI: And I know things have been a little off between you two lately."
"DEAN: Did she say that?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm saying that. I can see it, and by the way, I get it. But sometimes when things are out of whack, it freaks us out a little and makes us feel like we're losing something that's really important and that scares us even more so we try really hard to hold onto whatever it is we think we're losing and sometimes we hold on a little too hard."
"DEAN: Too hard?"
"LORELAI: Like calling ten times in a three hour period, too hard."
"DEAN: Fourteen times."
"LORELAI: Okay, now, see, I was gonna let you slide but hey  an honest man, I like that."
"DEAN: You think I'm holding on too hard to Rory?"
"LORELAI: I don't think you mean to."
"DEAN: You think I'm losing her?"
"LORELAI: I think you think you are."
"DEAN: Well, I just feel like nothing I do is. . . you know, I just want things back the way they used to be."
"LORELAI: I know you do, and they can be."
"DEAN: How?"
"LORELAI: I know it sounds crazy but sometimes giving people a little bit of space is actually the best thing to do."
"DEAN: Space?"
"LORELAI: Just a little."
"DEAN: Like what? Like don't call her, don't see her?"
"LORELAI: No, just let her breathe, let her relax, let her come to you for a change."
"DEAN: You're not telling me this to get rid of me, are you?"
"LORELAI: Please, if I was trying to get rid of you I would've started this conversation with, Let me tell you about my family'. I'm not telling you this to get rid of you, I'm telling you because I think it might help things between you guys. Just try it. If it doesn't work, I promise you can wash my car, too."
"DEAN: Okay."
"LORELAI: Do you want a soda?"
"DEAN: No, thanks. I'm gonna go. Uh, don't tell Rory I was here, okay?"
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm just sitting here at the table talking to myself. . .again."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"LORELAI: Bye Dean."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie is in the kitchen on the phone as Lorelai walks in]"
"SOOKIE: You know what, forget it! If that's how you run your business, then I deserve this for picking you in the first place. I hate you! [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"SOOKIE: Okay, new plan for the invites. We're getting married May fifteenth, four o'clock, front lawn  pass it on."
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: That's it, word of mouth. They used it for the Revolutionary w*r  who the hell am I to poopoo history, huh? I ask you."
"[Michel enters the kitchen]"
"MICHEL: What the hell is wrong with you?"
"LORELAI: With me?"
"MICHEL: Yes, you! Are you out of your mind?"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"MICHEL: Why in God's name would you tell my mother that I do not eat carbs?"
"LORELAI: Because you don't."
"MICHEL: That is private information, private about me."
"LORELAI: Michel, everybody in Stars Hollow knows you don't eat carbs."
"MICHEL: So what?"
"LORELAI: Calm down, have some toast."
"MICHEL: Do not talk to my mother ever again, do you understand me?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't understand. Michel, you and your mother seem crazy about each other. I just assumed since you gave up carbs a year ago, she knew."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, you know what happens when you assume."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MICHEL: I don't know. Something about a donkey  it's a stupid American phrase."
"LORELAI: I don't understand, Michel. You and your mother seem to have the perfect relationship."
"MICHEL: Yes, because I tell her nothing. We keep all subjects light and fluffy. We talk about clothes and food and Posh Spice and David Beckham and that is all. Nothing of value, nothing of substance."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"MICHEL: Now she knows I've been hiding something from her. Suddenly she's asking questions. Why did I leave France at eighteen? Where do I go at night? Who are my friends? What do they do? Where do they live? Why have I chosen this career? On and on and on and on  it never ends! I can't stand it, she's a complete pain. She won't stop. I took a six hour bath last night just to escape the incessant nagging. You did this to me! You turned my Giselle into a mother, and I hate you for it! I hate you very, very much! [leaves]"
"SOOKIE: So, feel better now?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I do, thanks."
"SOOKIE: Mm hmm."
"CUT TO CHILTON BUSINESS FAIR"
"[All of the student's projects are displayed on tables throughout the auditorium]"
"PARIS: Okay, I swept the room and I have to tell you, all sad. I think we're a lock."
"RORY: Really? I actually thought the locker alarm was pretty good."
"PARIS: Please, no one even looks when a car alarm goes off. How effective do you think a locker alarms going to be? Nope, I feel it, we are it. What's the word?"
"RICHARD: Every single idea in this room is completely worthless."
"PARIS: Yes."
"RICHARD: There's a lot of wasted cardboard in here, my friend."
"PARIS: We are going to win."
"RICHARD: Yes, we are."
"RORY: Okay, the two of you need to take a time out."
"HEADMASTER: Richard? Richard, hello."
"RICHARD: Hanlin, good to see you."
"HEADMASTER: What are you doing here?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'm actually advising Rory on her business project  the RX-2002."
"HEADMASTER: Oh, well, that's wonderful. You look great."
"RICHARD: I feel great."
"HEADMASTER: We don't see you at the club that much anymore."
"RICHARD: No, I've been very busy lately."
"HEADMASTER: Now, did I hear correctly  did you retire?"
"RICHARD: Right before Christmas."
"HEADMASTER: So it's true. I told it to Bitty and I couldn't believe it when we heard that."
"RICHARD: Well, a man can't work forever."
"HEADMASTER: No, that's true. I just can't picture you retired."
"RICHARD: It's been wonderful lately. Best move I've ever made. It's given me a lot of time to do a lot of wonderful things."
"HEADMASTER: Well, that does sound nice. What kinds of things are you doing?"
"RICHARD: Well, this."
"HEADMASTER: Well, there you go. Unfortunately, some of us aren't living the good life quite yet. I've got to get back. It's been wonderful seeing you, Richard. Let's have dinner soon."
"RICHARD: I would like that very much."
"HEADMASTER: I'll have Bitty give Em a call."
"RICHARD: You do that."
"PARIS: Did you see the brilliant hose hook idea over at table five? A hook on your belt for your garden hose. There's a Buster Keaton routine waiting to happen."
"RICHARD: So how are we doing?"
"RORY: Paris is practicing spiking the football then doing a backflip."
"RICHARD: Well."
"HEADMASTER: Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, all the projects have now been reviewed."
"PARIS: Here we go."
"HEADMASTER: And before we announce the winner, I must commend everyone for their fine work. There are many, many good ideas here today. It makes me proud."
"PARIS: Move it along, padre."
"HEADMASTER: Now I'd like to announce the winner  table 10, Miss Traster's class with the locker alarm."
"RICHARD: I don't understand, how is that possible?"
"PARIS: This is so lame. That alarm doesn't even work, I was just over there."
"RICHARD: This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard."
"RORY: Grandpa, it doesn't matter."
"RICHARD: It certainly does matter. You've all put in an extraordinary amount of time and effort and thought into this project. It deserved to win."
"PARIS: Yeah."
"RORY: Well, I wanted to win too, but we didn't."
"RICHARD: I'm going to talk to the headmaster about this."
"RORY: I wish you wouldn't."
"RICHARD: You were robbed, Rory, and I'm not going to sit back and simply watch it happen. [walks over to headmaster] Hanlin, good, I want a word with you."
"HEADMASTER: Is something wrong?"
"RICHARD: This contest is a disgrace."
"HEADMASTER: I beg your pardon?"
"RICHARD: I have been in the business world for thirty-five years."
"HEADMASTER: I know this."
"RICHARD: And in those thirty-five years, I've seen ideas come and I've seen ideas go, and I've learned a few things about what flies and what doesn't."
"HEADMASTER: I'm sure you have."
"RICHARD: I am telling you that out there in the real world, there is no way that a locker alarm that doesn't even work properly would be a viable business investment."
"HEADMASTER: Richard, we're not in the real world, we are in a school."
"RICHARD: Yes, a school that should be training children for the real world."
"HEADMASTER: Richard, calm down."
"RICHARD: I demand a recount."
"HEADMASTER: Very well. I just recounted, the alarm still wins."
"RICHARD: Hanlin!"
"HEADMASTER: Richard, your project was very good. It was definitely in the running. You should be proud."
"RICHARD: This is not my project, this is their project, the children's project."
"HEADMASTER: Really?"
"RICHARD: Yes! This has nothing to do with me, it's for the children!"
"HEADMASTER: But they're not the ones who are causing the public scene right now, you are."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory pull up and walk to the front door]"
"RORY: It was awful. He looked so upset. His face was turning red and he was practically shaking."
"LORELAI: Hey, did you notice when he gets mad he gets taller?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I don't know how he does it but he actually grows."
"RORY: Stop."
"LORELAI: The day I told him I was pregnant, twenty-four feet tall. It freaked the birds."
"RORY: Hey, I'm upset here."
"LORELAI: Honey, you did nothing. You went to your grandfather, who you greatly admire and actually like hanging out with, to ask for his help and advice. That's lovely and thoughtful."
"RORY: Please help me out tonight  no mention of work or Chilton or school or retirement."
"LORELAI: Nothing but politics and religion, got it."
"EMILY: [opens door] Hello girls."
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: Come in, come in. Dinner's almost ready. Richard, the girls are here. Richard? He came home today, didn't say a word, stomped off to his study, slammed the door, and he's been holed up in there ever since."
"RORY: Really?"
"EMILY: I can't even get him to answer me."
"LORELAI: Well, are you sure he's still in there?"
"EMILY: Of course he's still in there. The door's right there. I would've seen if he came out."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"EMILY: Not everyone leaves this house by climbing out the window and jumping into a waiting hot rod."
"RORY: Maybe someone should go talk to him."
"EMILY: I don't know what to do. What on earth happened today?"
"RORY: Things didn't go very well at the business fair."
"EMILY: What happened?"
"LORELAI: It was terrible  the tenth graders staged a hostile takeover of the eleventh graders."
"RORY: Our project didn't win and Grandpa took it badly."
"EMILY: Well, I am at my wit's end if that man is going to fall apart over a high school project."
"LORELAI: It's just a weird time for him, Mom."
"RORY: I feel so awful."
"LORELAI: Maybe he should go talk to somebody."
"EMILY: Like whom?"
"LORELAI: Like a psychiatrist?"
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, maybe it would help."
"EMILY: We do not go to psychiatrists."
"LORELAI: Mom, there's nothing wrong with getting help."
"EMILY: Lorelai Gilmore, are you seriously suggesting that your father go to a complete stranger and talk about his personal life?"
"LORELAI: Lots of people swear by it."
"EMILY: Yes, disturbed people, deviants, people with multiple personalities who see things and hear talking to them and roam the streets talking to themselves and licking parking meters."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Next thing you know, you'll be suggesting I go to a psychiatrist."
"LORELAI: Too many comebacks  I cannot pick."
"EMILY: Richard, is that you?"
"RICHARD: Of course it's me. Oh Rory, you're here, wonderful. Hello Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RICHARD: Well, I am starving. What's for dinner?"
"EMILY: What's for dinner? What do you mean, what's for dinner?"
"RICHARD: Well, I thought the question was relatively clear, but I'd be glad to rephrase it for you. Eh, what sort of food products will appear on various plates this evening?"
"EMILY: Richard Gilmore, you come home in a huff and you lock yourself in that study all afternoon. . ."
"RICHARD: Well, I had a lot of thinking to do, a lot of thinking. I owe that to you young lady."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"RICHARD: You should certainly not be sorry."
"EMILY: Richard, what  put that roll down and explain yourself!"
"RICHARD: This whole week, this whole experience with Rory and the locker first aid kit  that is a damn good idea, by the way, no matter what those yarnheads at that school of yours say. Anyway, this whole week made me realize something  I don't want to be retired."
"EMILY: You what?"
"RICHARD: I don't like it. I hate it, as a matter of fact."
"LORELAI: But Dad  ."
"RICHARD: It's boring. I have absolutely no idea what to do with myself. And frankly, I am tired of trying to find something to fill up my time."
"RORY: So what are you going to do?"
"RICHARD: I am going to work."
"EMILY: Are you thinking about asking for your job back?"
"RICHARD: Oh, God no! No no no no no no. I have decided to go into business for myself."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"EMILY: What?"
"RORY: Cool."
"RICHARD: It is cool, isn't it?"
"EMILY: But what are you going to do?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'm not sure yet. Perhaps I'll consult, maybe take on a partner, maybe I'll even teach."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: Well, you don't have to say it like that."
"LORELAI: Sorry. What?"
"RICHARD: I think thirty five years of experience will qualify me to teach a course or two at that local business college of yours."
"LORELAI: Oh my God. It's Who's the Boss, the later years."
"EMILY: Richard, are you serious about this?"
"RICHARD: As a heart attack."
"EMILY: But, but  ."
"RICHARD: I haven't felt this good in a very long time, Emily. I have the buzz, and I owe it all to you."
"RORY: Glad to be of service."
"EMILY: He's going to teach."
"LORELAI: Or consult."
"EMILY: Or consult."
"LORELAI: So licking a parking meter is just around the corner."
"CUT TO INSIDE JEEP"
"[That night, Lorelai and Rory are driving home]"
"LORELAI: Okay, that dinner was good."
"RORY: All of Grandma's dinners are good."
"LORELAI: I know, but this one had the rolls."
"RORY: Aw, those were excellent rolls."
"LORELAI: Weren't they? Hot and buttery with that split top thing going on. I miss the rolls."
"RORY: Well, she can make more next week."
"LORELAI: That's okay. I got four in my purse."
"RORY: You do not."
"LORELAI: Go ahead and check."
"RORY: Have you no shame?"
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"[Rory's pager goes off]"
"LORELAI: Ah, who's that?"
"RORY: It's Dean."
"LORELAI: Really? How many pages does that make for today?"
"RORY: Just one."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"RORY: In two days."
"LORELAI: Wow!"
"RORY: I know. He hasn't called or mysteriously appeared by my side or anything."
"LORELAI: Hmm, maybe he's calming down."
"RORY: I hope so. I actually got a chance to miss him today."
"LORELAI: That sounds good."
"RORY: It is good."
"LORELAI: Do you wanna grab my cell phone and give him a call?"
"RORY: Oh, no, tomorrow's fine."
"LORELAI: Are you sure? It's still early. You guys could hook up for a little while."
"RORY: I'm hanging out with Lane tonight."
"LORELAI: Lane?"
"RORY: Yeah, we have some serious CD listening to do. We're way behind on all the Elvis Costello reissues coming out."
"LORELAI: I didn't think Lane could hang out past nine."
"RORY: Her mom's at an antique fair in Woodbury until Sunday, and her grandmother's staying with her but she's asleep by six so we thought we'd be really bad and sneak out to Luke's."
"LORELAI: You're going to Luke's?"
"RORY: Yeah, maybe."
"LORELAI: Honey, why go to Luke's? Um, I mean, you just had ten rolls."
"RORY: No, you had ten rolls, and I don't even know if we'll go to Luke's. It's just a maybe."
"LORELAI: Okay, okay. Well, you guys have fun."
"[they pull up to Lane's house and Rory gets out of the car]"
"RORY: Okay, see you later."
"LORELAI: Sure you don't wanna call Dean?"
"RORY: Nope, tomorrow's fine."
"LORELAI: Yeah, tomorrow's fine."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai pulls up to the house and finds Dean sitting on her front porch]"
"LORELAI: Dean."
"DEAN: She likes Jess, doesn't she?"

"OPEN IN DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Lorelai and Rory are standing in the checkout line. Lorelai flips through a crossword puzzle book]"
"LORELAI: I hate crossword puzzles. They make me feel stupid."
"RORY: Then don't do them."
"LORELAI: Well, but if you don't do them, you're not only stupid, you're also a coward."
"RORY: Or you have better things to do with your time."
"LORELAI: You think people will buy that?"
"RORY: The people who line up on a daily basis and ask you if you do crossword puzzles and then, when you say no, challenge you as to why? Yes, I think they will buy it."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, look, new bag boy."
"RORY: Oh yeah, that's Marty. He's subbing for Dean while he's out of town."
"LORELAI: Wow, Marty does the jar twirl before putting the salsa in the bag. Impressive, very Cocktail."
"RORY: Marty's a nice guy."
"LORELAI: Marty's an ambitious snake in the grass."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: The jar twirl, the double bagging, the have a nice day, ma'am' after every customer. . .that guy's got an agenda."
"RORY: Which is?"
"LORELAI: He's out to take Dean's job!"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, he is. I'm telling you, he wants that position. Dean better hurry back from his grandmother's house or he can kiss his job goodbye."
"RORY: They're not going to fire Dean."
"LORELAI: Really, why not?"
"RORY: Well, for starter's, someone stole Taylor's ladder last week and Dean is the only one who can reach the top shelves."
"LORELAI: Huh, interesting."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Just as Marty, aka Eve Harrington, shows up trying to take Dean's job, Taylor's ladder mysteriously disappears, suddenly making Dean invaluable no matter what fancy tricks Lon Chaney Junior over there pulls. Good thinking, Dean  smart thinking, my friend."
"RORY: You need to start napping in the afternoons."
"LORELAI: Hey Taylor, pulling double duty today?"
"TAYLOR: Oh, I like to fill in behind the register every now and then. It keeps me in contact with the clientele. Also, it allows me to keep an eye on the take a penny' pot here, make sure people aren't pocketing those pennies for their own personal gain but are legitimately using them to make exact change."
"RORY: Oh cool. Mom, look."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, it's Movie in the Square night again, great."
"RORY: We'll be there."
"TAYLOR: Ah, excellent. There you are."
"LORELAI: What's the movie this year?"
"TAYLOR: Oh, it's going to be something really great."
"LORELAI: Really, what?"
"TAYLOR: A real winner."
"LORELAI: What's it called?"
"TAYLOR: Well, show up and be surprised."
"LORELAI: Why don't you tell me what the movie is?"
"TAYLOR: No."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"TAYLOR: Because."
"LORELAI: Because why? What is the. . .oh no."
"TAYLOR: There is a line behind you."
"LORELAI: You chose The Yearling again?"
"TAYLOR: It is a fine, wholesome motion picture. Moving story, lovely scenes of nature."
"LORELAI: You've shown The Yearling the last three years in a row!"
"TAYLOR: You know something, I'm getting a little tired of hearing you complain about this every single year."
"LORELAI: I'm tired, too. Pick another movie."
"TAYLOR: A lot of hard work and careful planning go into those nights. You never help plan, you never volunteer, you have never once been a ticket ripper as long as I have been involved in that function. Personally, missy, if you can't participate with a smile and a hug, then you shouldn't participate at all."
"LORELAI: I shouldn't, but I am. Pick another movie."
"TAYLOR: No!"
"LORELAI: Taylor, there's millions of great movies out there. Any one of them would be better than The Yearling for the fourth time."
"TAYLOR: Fine, you do it!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"TAYLOR: You pick the movie."
"LORELAI: Seriously?"
"TAYLOR: I've had it. You have such strong opinions about everything, you go out and try to find a movie that everybody will enjoy. It's all yours. I relinquish my movie picking crown to you."
"LORELAI: He relinquished his crown."
"RORY: I heard."
"LORELAI: I got his crown."
"RORY: And it looks great on you."
"LORELAI: Cool, this is gonna be fun! Let's go home and make popcorn and pick which movie we're gonna show."
"RORY: I get to help?"
"LORELAI: Of course."
"RORY: Oh, and can I borrow the crown?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, honey. We'll have to see."

"LORELAI: The Wizard of Oz."
"RORY: The Sting."
"LORELAI: Rocky."
"RORY: Crimes and Misdemeanors."
"LORELAI: The Singing Detective."
"RORY: That was a miniseries."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: So it's like six hours long."
"LORELAI: Good point. Ooh, I got it! Arthur."
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Or Sophie's Choice."
"RORY: Very similar."
"LORELAI: Oh man, I can't choose, there's too many great movies. The burden is overwhelming. I'm sinking under the pressure. My grasp on reality is slipping. I can't do it, I can't hold on, I just can't, I just. . .ooh, hey, how about Cabin Boy?"
"[phone rings]"
"RORY: Will you get that?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Time?"
"RORY: 6:45."
"LORELAI: On?"
"RORY: Wednesday. Ooh! [answers phone] Dad, hi!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey kiddo, what's going on?"
"RORY: Not much. Just getting ready for school and trying to think up movies."
"CHRISTOPHER: Movies for what?"
"RORY: Our town does this big movie festival outdoors every year and this year Mom gets to pick the movie."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh yeah? How'd she get that gig?"
"RORY: She ticked off the guy that usually does it and he quit."
"CHRISTOPHER: Sounds about right."
"RORY: So how are things there? How's Sherry?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, uh, nothing much is going on here. Same ol', same ol'. Hey, listen, uh, I've gotta cut this talk short but I sent you an email, so read it and add an extra forty minutes onto my time for next week's call, deal?"
"RORY: Deal. Do you wanna say hello to Mom before you go?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, no, I can't, I really need to run. You say hello for me."
"RORY: Okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I'll talk to you Wednesday. Bye Sweetie."
"RORY: Bye Dad. [hangs up] He says hello."
"LORELAI: He does not."
"RORY: So, are you gonna tell me what it is you two are fighting about?"
"LORELAI: I'm not fighting."
"RORY: Okay, are you gonna tell me what it is you're not fighting about that keeps you from talking to each other ever again?"
"LORELAI: What about Desperately Seeking Susan?"
"RORY: What about, my mother is two?"
"LORELAI: Never saw it  Angie Dickinson?"
"RORY: You're impossible."
"LORELAI: You're right. You're Impossible was the one with Angie Dickinson."
"RORY: Fine, forget it, I give. Stay in a fight, I don't care. I'm late for school. We'll finish the list later."
"LORELAI: After school, Luke's?"
"RORY: I'll be there."
"LORELAI: Bye hon."
"RORY: Bye."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH CLASSROOM"
"[Students are taking a test.]"
"TEACHER: Fifteen minutes left."
"[Jess sneaks in and sits behind Lane]"
"JESS: Lane. . .Lane."
"LANE: Sh."
"JESS: I need a pencil."
"LANE: I don't have one."
"JESS: Then I need a pen."
"LANE: You only have fifteen minutes left."
"JESS: Then I need the answers."
"LANE: There's a pen in my bag."
"JESS: I can't go through your bag."
"LANE: Yes, you can."
"JESS: My mother told me never go through a lady's bag. . .at least, not until you're a couple blocks away. I'm just kidding, she never said that. Though it sounds like pretty good advice, doesn't it?"
"LANE: Take it and shut up. [hands him a pen]"
"JESS: Well, I tell you, it's true  small towns sure are friendly."
"CUT TO PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE"
"[There's a knock at the door.]"
"PRINCIPAL: Come in."
"[Luke walks in]"
"LUKE: Yeah, I got a call you wanted to see me. I'm, uh, Luke Danes  Jess Mariano's uncle."
"PRINCIPAL: Jess Mariano. Ah yes, come in."
"LUKE: Thanks. So is everything okay? I didn't see any cop cars or fire trucks out front so. . ."
"PRINCIPAL: Mr. Danes, please have a seat."
"LUKE: A seat? So this is a seat thing. Okay, what's he done?"
"PRINCIPAL: Why do you assume he's done something?"
"LUKE: Oh, I don't know. You're staring at a folder that's looking a little thick there. I get a call to come right over here and talk to you, so why don't you just tell me what he's done?"
"PRINCIPAL: Nothing."
"LUKE: Nothing?"
"PRINCIPAL: No homework, no class participation, his attendance record is erratic at best. His attitude towards his teachers, it ranges from indifferent to hostile. He shows no interest in school activities or other students, and there is the issue of the disappearing baseballs."
"LUKE: The what?"
"PRINCIPAL: Every baseball on campus seems to have disappeared."
"LUKE: Oh, come on, you don't think Jess seriously. . . I'll check when I get home."
"PRINCIPAL: I appreciate that. Now, I don't suspect we'll solve every problem in one meeting, so let's focus on the most important one  his grades."
"LUKE: Not good?"
"PRINCIPAL: Not good."
"LUKE: Well, I'll have a talk with him about that."
"PRINCIPAL: You're gonna have to do a lot more than talk to him. You're gonna have to help him."
"LUKE: Me? Oh, no, I'm not the one you want helping him. I went to this school  I'm sure there's still a note stuffed in there about me with the words trade school' stamped in really big letters."
"PRINCIPAL: Well, if you can't help him, you're gonna have to find someone who can."
"LUKE: Like who?"
"PRINCIPAL: A relative."
"LUKE: I don't think so. Believe me, I'm the Einstein of the clan."
"PRINCIPAL: Well, maybe you need to hire a tutor."
"LUKE: A tutor? Oh geez."
"PRINCIPAL: Mr. Danes, Jess is flunking out. He's not going to make it. Now, if something it not done about that right now, he's going to repeat this year. I'm sorry, but that's where we are."
"LUKE: Okay, well, if that's where we are, then I'll just have to figure something out."
"PRINCIPAL: Good. And let's not forget about those baseballs."
"LUKE: Right."
"PRINCIPAL: Been using tennis balls for a couple of weeks."
"LUKE: Wow."
"PRINCIPAL: Very different results."
"LUKE: I'm sure it is."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter going through a list of movies]"
"LORELAI: If we take off Fletch and Urban Cowboy, we still have seventy-five possibilities."
"RORY: How are we gonna pick just one?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Maybe we should do like a movie marathon weekend. You know, just show one movie after the other for three days and charge everyone a fortune, gauge them of bottled water, have those really little disgusting bathrooms  it'd be like our own Woodstock."
"TAYLOR: Ah, good, there you are. I have something for you."
"LORELAI: What?"
"TAYLOR: This. [puts a large binder on the counter]"
"LORELAI: Geez."
"TAYLOR: Now, when you get through this and make your decision, the number of the man you need to contact is inside on the first page."
"LORELAI: What man? What is this?"
"TAYLOR: That is the list of titles that are available for you to pick from for the movie night."
"LORELAI: The list of titles? I'm sorry, can't we just pick our own movie?"
"TAYLOR: You're not serious?"
"LORELAI: Not often, but just there  yeah, I had some serious going."
"TAYLOR: My dear girl, movies are expensive and we get fabulous deals with this particular place. They have a wide selection and they're very friendly and since it all goes to charity, they agree to give us anything on that list for free."
"LORELAI: So we have to pick a movie off this list?"
"TAYLOR: Oh, it's fun. They put the movie title over here and a brief description of the storyline over here and believe me, there are some excellent movies on that list. Really, top notch."
"LORELAI: Arctic Flight  man with plane flies charter to Alaska, hired by bear hunter who turns out to be Russian spy, love story develops with pilot and school teachers, Eskimos do tribal dance. You made this up."
"TAYLOR: Don't I wish. Okay, well, I can't wait to see what you come up with. Bye girls."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: k*ll Shark."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: Shark fisherman on ocean, Mexican cantina with tequila and Mariachi music, has good scene of catching and cleaning shark."
"LORELAI: Where Are Your Children? Hip music and singing about kids getting into trouble, sneaking booze into clubs, stealing car, fight between girls, romance starts then guy goes in the Navy."
"RORY: Huh. Sudden Danger  mom dies of gas asphyxiation, son blamed, good kiss scene."
"LORELAI: Suspense  ice skater falls in love with hired help. Well, at least now I know how Snow Dogs got made."
"[Luke walks into the diner]"
"LUKE: Hey. Listen, have you seen Jess?"
"RORY: I think I saw him go upstairs earlier."
"LUKE: Oh, great, thanks."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke walks in as Jess is going through his CDs]"
"LUKE: Oh, good, you're here. So, you file those under the band names?"
"JESS: Genre."
"LUKE: Right, genre, that makes sense, makes a lot of sense. Oh, what is that? Something for school?"
"JESS: Nope."
"LUKE: Oh, well, shouldn't you be reading something for school?"
"JESS: Why?"
"LUKE: I don't know. I mean, I know you like reading and since you like reading, you might as well read something you're gonna get graded on so you can get graded on something you like because you like reading."
"JESS: What are you babbling about?"
"LUKE: I went to see your principal today."
"JESS: Huh."
"LUKE: He says you're flunking out. He says you're not showing up for class. He says you stole their baseballs. You stole their baseballs? Why would you do that? What could you possibly need five hundred baseballs for?"
"JESS: Can we talk about this later?"
"LUKE: Why, you got a big Frisbee heist going down at six? Jess, Mr. Mertin said if you don't start doing better, they're not gonna let you be a senior."
"JESS: Bummer."
"LUKE: They're gonna hold you back."
"JESS: Well, at least I'll know where my classes are."
"LUKE: Jess, this is serious. You're flunking out. You're looking at being in the eleventh grade for the rest of your life. You're gonna be the kid in the back of the room with a beard and a racing form babbling incoherently about Steely Dan."
"JESS: Steely Dan?"
"LUKE: The group may change, the freak in the back never does."
"JESS: I'm going out."
"LUKE: Don't you wanna go to college?"
"JESS: Don't wait up."
"LUKE: What do you wanna be when you grow up?"
"JESS: About twenty miles south of wherever you are."
"LUKE: You have to think about the future. If you don't get through high school, who's gonna hire you? You're not gonna have any k*ll."
"JESS: Stop."
"LUKE: How you gonna work, huh? How you gonna eat? How you gonna pay rent? What are you gonna do, Jess?"
"JESS: Geez, I don't know, maybe I'll work in a diner."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting at the kitchen table going through the book of movie titles as Rory walks in]"
"LORELAI: Marshmallow?"
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Okay, I have now finished going through every single one of these movies. I've read them, reviewed their merits, and I'm proud to announce that I have chosen our movie. How does The Yearling sound to you?"
"RORY: Perfect."
"LORELAI: And buh-bye."
"[there's a knock at the front door]"
"LORELAI: Oh, that must be Pauline Kale rising from the dead."
"RORY: Tell her hey."
"[Lorelai goes to answer the door, Luke is standing on the porch with a box]"
"LORELAI: Pauline!"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Never mind. What are you doing here?"
"LUKE: Uh, I made some brownies, I thought you might like some."
"LORELAI: Oh, gee, since I just ate half a bag of marshmallows, six Pop Tarts, four bagel dogs and a really stale Cheese Nip  yup, it's brownie time, thanks. Hey, here's a question for you."
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Well, you probably have a diner full of people who would love these brownies  plus, I bet they'd pay you for them."
"LUKE: Well, I accidentally dropped triple the amount of cocoa powder in the batter so I either had to dump the batch or find someone with some sort of superhuman chocolate tolerance  only one name came to mind."
"LORELAI: God, I love being special. What?"
"LUKE: Nothing. I just. . .hey, uh, is Rory here by any chance?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she's in her room."
"LUKE: Can I talk to her for a sec?"
"LORELAI: Sure, go right ahead."
"LUKE: Hey, thanks. [knocks on Rory's door] Rory, it's Luke. Can I come in for a minute?"
"RORY: [opens door] Hey, what's up?"
"LUKE: Not much. Can I . . ."
"RORY: Uh, yeah, come on in."
"LUKE: So I see you're studying."
"RORY: Yup."
"LUKE: That's good. Studying is very, very good. What you're doing right there with the books, very good."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LUKE: Okay, look, I wanted to ask you a favor. Oh. Uh. I was wondering if you could tutor Jess."
"RORY: What?"
"LUKE: He's not doing too well in school. The principal said he's not gonna let him move on unless something changes. I was wondering if you could help."
"RORY: That doesn't make any sense, he's smart enough to pass any subject."
"LUKE: I don't think it's his lack of smarts, more like his lack of proximity to the actual classes that's the problem."
"RORY: Ah."
"LUKE: Yes."
"RORY: Okay, what subject does he need help in?"
"LUKE: I'd say all of them, probably."
"RORY: Huh."
"LUKE: Look, I don't expect you to work miracles and it doesn't have to be a full time everyday thing. If you could just get him through a couple of his next tests, maybe make the school see that he can do it, that would probably help out a lot."
"RORY: Sure."
"LUKE: Great, tonight?"
"RORY: Tonight."
"LUKE: I really appreciate this. Ah, okay, you should get back to your studying, otherwise you're completely useless to me. [walks into kitchen] Okay, so I'll see you guys at dinner probably."
"LORELAI: Wait, hold on  what was that all about?"
"LUKE: Oh, Rory's gonna tutor Jess."
"LORELAI: She is?"
"LUKE: Yeah, just for a little while, help get him on the right track."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"LUKE: Okay, I should be getting back. Enjoy the brownies, I'll see if I can screw up a cake for you later on."
"LORELAI: Sounds great."
"[Luke leaves]"
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[Lorelai follows Luke out into the front yard]"
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, hang on just a sec."
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Um, listen, about Rory doing this tutoring thing."
"LUKE: I really appreciate it, by the way."
"LORELAI: I know you do. I just. . .Rory's so sweet and she would never say no to anyone cause she loves to help, but I'm not sure if it's the best idea."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Well, she's got her own studies to worry about."
"LUKE: I know, and I promise this is not gonna take up all her time. It's just for a little while."
"LORELAI: Okay, but - ."
"LUKE: Plus, Rory's pretty serious about school. I don't think she'd say she had the time if she didn't."
"LORELAI: I know, Rory is a great student, but she's just a kid. Don't you need like a professional tutor to help with Jess? You know, somebody with a degree and a pipe and one of those coats with the elbow patches on it?"
"LUKE: I need someone Jess is gonna listen to, someone he's gonna. . .I don't know, look up to. That sure isn't me and it sure isn't some tutor. He likes Rory and Rory's on the path that I'd like to see Jess on  school and college. He needs to see somebody he respects doing what he should be doing and Rory's the only person I can think of who fits that description."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but you don't know for sure that he'll listen to Rory."
"LUKE: No, but I gotta do something, don't I? I mean, what would you do if you were me?"
"LORELAI: Nuh. Okay, just make sure it's not too much time, okay?"
"LUKE: I will."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: Enjoy the brownie."
"LORELAI: Mm."
"[Luke leaves; Lorelai tries the brownie and makes a face]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. Mmm, that's good."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table as Kirk walks up to them]"
"KIRK: Ah, Lorelai, good. I need one minute of your time."
"LORELAI: I'll give you two because you scare me."
"KIRK: I hear through the grapevine that you are the one in charge of selecting the movie for this year's movie night?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I am."
"KIRK: Okay, well, I don't know if you know this about me, but I have great creative ambitions."
"LORELAI: I did not know that about you, Kirk."
"KIRK: It's true. Don't get me wrong, I love the blue collar work. I enjoy the plight of the every man. But as much as the mail letter delivered and the DSL line installed and the latest J. Lo flick rented fills me with a deep sense of pride, in my soul I am Akira Kurosawa."
"LORELAI: Seven Samurai, great movie."
"KIRK: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Seven Samurai."
"KIRK: I'm sorry, I don't  ."
"LORELAI: Akira Kurosawa directed Seven Samurai. It's a great Japanese movie."
"KIRK: Japanese movie? No, I'm sorry, I have the wrong person. Who's the guy who directed all those Facts of Life's?"
"LORELAI: I don't  ."
"KIRK: Asaad Kelada, sorry. In my soul I know I am Asaad Kelada."
"LORELAI: What do you need from me, Kirk?"
"KIRK: I've made a short film that I've been working on for about five years now and if I rush, I can have done my Thursday night. I'm very proud of it, and I was wondering if you would consider screening it before the movie tomorrow. It would mean a great deal to my career."
"LORELAI: Well, uh, what kind of movie is it?"
"KIRK: Oh, you mean is it blue? No, perfectly PG."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"KIRK: It's not exactly Babe, it's more like Babe 2."
"LORELAI: Got it."
"KIRK: Same pig, harder edge."
"LORELAI: Okay, Kirk, I hear you. I wanna help you. Let me think about it and I'll get back to you."
"KIRK: Here's a copy of the film. Take a look and call me. And remember, I can edit out two of the hells but I need to keep all the damns. It's a street cred thing."
"LORELAI: Bye Kirk."
"[Kirk leaves]"
"LORELAI: Well, at least now I have something fun to do tonight."
"RORY: You're not watching that without me."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll wait. So, um. . .ooh, do you wanna get some pie?"
"RORY: No, I'm full."
"LORELAI: Coffee? How bout some coffee?"
"RORY: I'm good."
"LORELAI: Hot chocolate?"
"RORY: No, thanks."
"LORELAI: Egg cream? Now, I never had an egg cream but it sounds just disgusting enough to be fabulous."
"RORY: We're just going to study."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: And we'll be right here doing it."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: So all this stalling is completely unnecessary."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: So go."
"LORELAI: I will. Just finishing up the coffee that I paid for already. All right, that's enough, I'm going. Goodbye."
"RORY: Bye. Um, Mom?"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"RORY: Listen, just in case, and I don't think he will, but if Dean calls, will you tell him I'm with Lane?"
"LORELAI: I thought you said this was nothing."
"RORY: It is nothing."
"LORELAI: That you guys were just studying."
"RORY: We are."
"LORELAI: Then how come I have to lie to Dean?"
"RORY: Well, you know as well as I do that it's not gonna be okay with Dean if I'm studying with Jess."
"LORELAI: Then maybe you shouldn't be. I mean, if you feel weird enough about it that I have to lie to Dean."
"RORY: I'm not asking you to lie to Dean."
"LORELAI: You told me to tell him that you're with Lane."
"RORY: Well, that was just because  ."
"LORELAI: I don't see Lane here  sounds like a lie to me."
"RORY: Fine, forget it. Just don't answer the phone."
"LORELAI: Hello, I get calls there, too. I'm not whatever happened to Baby Jane?' yet, thank you very much."
"RORY: Just tell him that I'm studying, which is what I am doing, so you will not be lying, okay?"
"[Jess walks over to them]"
"JESS: Hey Teach."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: You guys done yet?"
"LORELAI: Just not yet."
"JESS: Okay, well, I'll be right over there when you are. I just can't wait for that learning to begin. Hey, are we gonna do some of those Schoolhouse Rocks songs?"
"RORY: I'll be right there, Jess."
"JESS: Cause they say if you just make learning fun. . ."
"LORELAI: Give us a minute, okay?"
"JESS: Well, hurry  a mind is a terrible thing to waste."
"RORY: I'll be home early."
"LORELAI: Fine. Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye Jess."
"JESS: Ma'am."
"[Lorelai leaves]"
"RORY: So, are you ready to start?"
"JESS: Yes, I am."
"RORY: Where are your books?"
"JESS: Huh, I don't know."
"RORY: How are we gonna study without your books?"
"JESS: I guess we can't. Too bad. So, what now  movie?"
"RORY: Get your books."
"JESS: The cat ate them."
"RORY: Get your books or I'm going home."
"JESS: Wait there. [does magic trick]"
"CUT TO THE DINER LATER THAT NIGHT"
"[Rory and Jess are sitting at a table. Rory is going through a book as Jess plays with a deck of cards.]"
"RORY: Explain to me the political ramifications of the Marshall Plan."
"JESS: Pick a card. [Rory throws the whole deck on the floor] Huh, well, that just made the trick a little bit harder."
"RORY: Jess, focus."
"JESS: Where's Dean tonight?"
"RORY: We just went over this. There's no way you already forgot it."
"JESS: Work?"
"RORY: I will make you write it out fifty times on the specials board if that's what it takes."
"JESS: Cause if he's not at work, he must be free, so he doesn't care that you're here?"
"RORY: No, he doesn't. He's visiting his grandmother."
"JESS: Where?"
"RORY: Chicago."
"JESS: So he doesn't know."
"RORY: It wouldn't matter."
"JESS: So you'll tell him when he gets back?"
"RORY: We're studying."
"JESS: You're studying, I'm prying into your personal life."
"RORY: Jess, why won't you at least try to remember the Marshall Plan?"
"JESS: Have you ever read ""Please k*ll Me""?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Oral history of the punk movement. You'd like it  you can borrow it if you want."
"RORY: I'm here to help you study. Now, if you want me to go, I'll go, but if I'm going to stay, then you will stop distracting me and start paying attention, understand?"
"JESS: I understand."
"RORY: Good. And yes, I would like to borrow it, thank you very much. Now open your book."
"CUT TO DINER LATER THAT NIGHT"
"[Jess finishes writing something on a notepad, then hands it to Rory]"
"JESS: Done."
"RORY: This isn't Shakespeare."
"JESS: It's not?"
"RORY: It's the words to a Clash song."
"JESS: Ah, now, but which Clash song?"
"RORY: Hey, I'm not the one being tested right now."
"JESS: Ten seconds."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: Nine, eight, seven."
"RORY: Stop it."
"JESS: Six, five, four."
"RORY: You know you're really starting to. . ."
"JESS: Three."
"RORY: Ooh, ooh, g*n of Brixton!"
"JESS: A plus."
"RORY: Why would you even agree to this studying thing in the first place?"
"JESS: Because Luke said I had to."
"RORY: You've never done anything because someone said you had to."
"JESS: I moved here because someone said I had to."
"RORY: Very different."
"JESS: Yeah, well. . .hey, do you wanna get outta here?"
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: I'm sick of studying."
"RORY: How can you be sick of studying? You haven't done any studying. You've done card tricks, you've made coffee, you've tried to explain to me how on earth Coldplay could be considered an alternative band, but as of yet, no studying."
"JESS: That's your car?"
"RORY: Yes, it is."
"JESS: Okay, tell you what. Let's go get some ice cream, and then when we get back, I'll study."
"RORY: This is a diner, there's ice cream here."
"JESS: Yes, but we don't have any cones."
"RORY: Cones?"
"JESS: I need cones."
"RORY: Well, so, if we go get ice cream. . ."
"JESS: In cones."
"RORY: Then you will be a perfect student for the rest of the night?"
"JESS: That's right."
"RORY: I could not believe you less. Here, you drive, I'll read you Othello. Won't that be fun?"
"JESS: You have no idea how much."
"CUT TO INSIDE RORY'S CAR"
"[Jess and Rory are each eating an ice cream cone]"
"JESS: Admit it, it's always better in a cone."
"RORY: It's always better in a cone."
"JESS: Putting ice cream in a dish, eating it with a spoon?"
"RORY: What is wrong with people?"
"JESS: Hold the wheel."
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: I'm dripping here, hold the wheel."
"RORY: I can't hold the wheel, you're driving. The person who's driving has to hold the wheel. That's the first thing they teach you in driver's ed."
"JESS: Huh, I gotta take that class one of those days. Take the wheel."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: I'm letting go."
"RORY: Stop! Take it back. Okay, you are taking this wheel back and when you do, I'm going to k*ll you. I'm just letting you know that."
"JESS: I appreciate the warning."
"RORY: Jess!"
"JESS: Okay, I got it. Geez, you look pale. Are you okay?"
"RORY: Death, and it's going to be painful."
"JESS: You're not gonna k*ll me. Think how dull your life would be without me."
"RORY: Serious question?"
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: You know you're smarter than most everybody at your school. It takes you like five minutes to finish a book. You read everything, you remember everything, you could ace those classes easily. Why don't you? You don't need a tutor. It's crazy that they're talking about leaving you back."
"JESS: Whatever."
"RORY: You can do anything you wanted, you can be anything you wanted."
"JESS: Rory."
"RORY: I. . .is it like a cool thing?"
"JESS: I could care less about being cool."
"RORY: Well, inform me, please."
"JESS: I'm never going to college, why waste the time in high school?"
"RORY: And why aren't you going to college?"
"JESS: Please."
"RORY: What? Please what  why is it so crazy?"
"JESS: Ask my mother, she could give you a couple reasons. Oh, and I'm sure Principal Mertin can chime in with a few good ones. In fact, ask your mother. She doesn't know me all that well but I'm sure she could improvise a few things."
"RORY: Do not give me that whole I'm so misunderstood, Kurt Cobainy' thing. You are way stronger than that and I don't even wanna hear it. You have to go to college."
"JESS: No, you have to go to college."
"RORY: But don't you have any plans?"
"JESS: Yes, I plan to get out of Stars Hollow."
"RORY: And go where?"
"JESS: Wherever."
"RORY: And do what?"
"JESS: Whatever."
"RORY: Wherever, whatever."
"JESS: I'll live where I live, I'll work when I need money, and I'll see where I end up."
"RORY: You could do more."
"JESS: Oh, here come the pompoms."
"RORY: No, no pompoms, just me saying you could do more."
"JESS: So, Courtney, what about you?"
"RORY: What about me?"
"JESS: What are your big ambitions?"
"RORY: Harvard."
"JESS: And after Harvard?"
"RORY: I'm gonna be a journalist."
"JESS: Paula Zahn?"
"RORY: Christiane Amapour"
"JESS: You're gonna be an overseas correspondent?"
"RORY: Yes, I am."
"JESS: You're gonna crawl around in trenches and stand on top of buildings and have b*mb going off in the background and some wars raging all around you?"
"RORY: What, you don't think I can do it?"
"JESS: No, I do. Just sounds a little too  ."
"RORY: A little what?"
"JESS: Just sounds a little too rough for you."
"RORY: Well, it's not a little too rough for me. I hope it's not a little too rough for me, I've been talking about this forever. I mean, I don't even know what I would do if  ."
"JESS: Hey, I didn't mean to freak you out. I'm sorry. I'm sure you'll do it. You will, I promise. I'll help you practice, okay? Tomorrow, you'll stand in the middle of the street and I will drive straight at you screaming in a foreign language."
"RORY: Well, you're gonna have to learn a foreign language first."
"JESS: Well, it's lucky I've got me a tutor, isn't it? Okay, so I guess we should be getting back. I did promise to study if you went on this ice cream run with me."
"RORY: Yes, you did."
"JESS: Okay, so I just go straight and we'll be back at Luke's."
"RORY: Good sense of direction."
"JESS: Of course, I could turn right and then we'd just be driving around in circles for awhile."
"RORY: Turn right."
"JESS: As you wish."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is standing at the kitchen table as the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory, great. Tell me, was it the China Ball, the China Doll, or the China Wall that had the really good shrimp balls?"
"RORY: I think it was the China Doll."
"LORELAI: Okay, these can go. You'll be so proud of me, I'm organizing the takeout drawer. I'm weeding out all the dogs and I'm putting happy face stickers on the dishes that have been huge successes to make our ordering more efficient. Where are you?"
"RORY: I need you to be calm."
"LORELAI: Calm about what?"
"RORY: Calm about what I have to tell you."
"LORELAI: What  where are you?"
"RORY: I'm all right."
"LORELAI: Well, of course you're all right  why wouldn't you be all right?"
"RORY: Because. . .I got in an accident."
"LORELAI: What? What accident? What do you mean you got in an accident?"
"RORY: Jess and I went for ice cream and we were just driving and it was dark and this dog or cat or possum, I don't know  it was small and furry, and it ran out into the middle of the road and Jess swerved and  ."
"LORELAI: Jess swerved?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Jess was driving?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Jess was driving your car and you got in an accident?"
"RORY: But I'm fine and he's fine and the furry thing is fine. The car's a little messed up, but there's nothing for you to be worried about."
"LORELAI: Where are you?"
"RORY: I'm in the hospital."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL"
"[Lorelai walks up to the nurse's station]"
"LORELAI: Um, hi, hi, excuse me, uh, my daughter's here, she was in a car accident. Her name is Rory Gilmore."
"NURSE: Okay, just take a seat."
"LORELAI: I don't wanna take a seat."
"NURSE: It'll be one minute."
"LORELAI: Hey, do you remember in Terms of Endearment, that scene where Shirley MacLaine is in the hospital and freaks out because they won't give her daughter a sh*t? She got that from me and she toned it down a little. So, once again, I'm looking for my daughter, Rory Gilmore?"
"NURSE: First door on your left."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Lorelai walks into the room  a doctor is wrapping Rory's arm]"
"LORELAI: Rory, good. Are you okay?"
"RORY: I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: Please tell her that I'm fine."
"DOCTOR: She's fine."
"LORELAI: Well, then, what's with the wrapping?"
"DOCTOR: Well - ."
"LORELAI: If she's fine, there'd be no wrapping. There's no wrapping if she's fine."
"DOCTOR: Her arm hit the dashboard. She sustained a minor hairline fracture to her wrist."
"LORELAI: So she broke her wrist?"
"RORY: No, it's just a fracture."
"LORELAI: Honey, let George Clooney talk here, okay?"
"DOCTOR: It's a tiny fracture, absolutely nothing serious. I'm gonna put a cast on it. She'll wear it for a couple weeks, that's it."
"LORELAI: A cast?"
"RORY: It barely hurts, I swear."
"LORELAI: And that's it  just the wrist, everything else is fine?"
"DOCTOR: She seems perfectly healthy."
"LORELAI: She seems healthy? Did you check everything out?"
"DOCTOR: Well, we checked almost everything that could've been affected, yes."
"LORELAI: Almost everything?"
"DOCTOR: Miss Gilmore, I assure you, we were very thorough."
"LORELAI: I'm sure you were, I just would like some extra thorough. Uh, anything that could've possibly, in any scenario, affected this body, I want it checked out."
"DOCTOR: I'll run a few more x-rays if that'll make you feel better."
"LORELAI: It will, thank you."
"DOCTOR: And then we'll put the cast on her, so it's gonna be a little while before she's out of here."
"LORELAI: I can wait."
"DOCTOR: Okay. Rory, I'll be right back. You sit still for a minute, okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"[doctor leaves]"
"LORELAI: Aw."
"RORY: The car's not so good."
"LORELAI: Oh, nobody cares about the car."
"RORY: Jess made sure that he called the ambulance and that I was okay before he even talked to the police and  ."
"LORELAI: Let's just hear about the details later, okay? I just want you to relax now."
"RORY: You're not mad?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not mad. So they, they uh, brought you in the ambulance?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Did they use the siren?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: I hope Taylor was in bed already."
"RORY: It was after nine so there's a good chance he was."
"LORELAI: Nice."
"[the doctor returns]"
"DOCTOR: Okay, Rory, I'm gonna have the nurse take you down to x-ray now."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Oh, can I go with her?"
"DOCTOR: I'm sorry, you have to wait outside. It'll be about an hour if you wanna go grab some coffee or something."
"LORELAI: Okay, thanks. Smile pretty for the camera."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai bangs on the door]"
"LORELAI: Luke! Luke!"
"[Luke opens the door and Lorelai rushes into the diner]"
"LUKE: Hey, I was  ."
"LORELAI: Where is he?"
"LUKE: Who?"
"LORELAI: Jess! Where's Jess, Luke?"
"LUKE: I don't know, I just got back. What's going on? I got here and they weren't here."
"LORELAI: Jess!"
"LUKE: Hey, talk to me!"
"[cut to the upstairs hallway]"
"LORELAI: Jess, answer me right now!"
"LUKE: What's wrong, what happened?"
"LORELAI: There was an accident."
"[they walk inside the apartment and Lorelai looks around for Jess]"
"LUKE: What - what accident?"
"LORELAI: Jess!"
"LUKE: What accident?"
"LORELAI: Jess was driving Rory's car and he crashed it."
"LUKE: What, when?"
"LORELAI: What do you mean, when? Tonight, tonight  he crashed it tonight! Jess, dammit!"
"[Lorelai walks out of the apartment]"
"LUKE: What happened? Is anyone hurt? Lorelai!"
"[Luke follows her down into the diner]"
"LUKE: Hey, I'm talking to you here."
"LORELAI: Where would he be? Where would he go?"
"LUKE: I asked you if anyone was hurt?"
"LORELAI: Uh, was anyone hurt? Well, let's see. Uh, Rory's in the emergency room now with a fractured wrist, so yeah, I'd say someone was hurt."
"LUKE: Rory fractured her wrist?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she has to wear a cast for two weeks, she's getting x-rays and tests."
"LUKE: What about Jess  is he hurt?"
"LORELAI: No, Luke  Jess did the hurting. That little punk nephew of yours almost k*ll my kid tonight."
"LUKE: Look, I'm sure it was an accident. Accidents happen."
"LORELAI: Not with my kid in the car, they don't."
"LUKE: Okay, you just need to calm down."
"LORELAI: Why did you do this?"
"LUKE: What are you talking about? Why did I do what?"
"LORELAI: Why did you bring him here?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: If you hadn't brought him here, none of this would've happened."
"LUKE: This is my fault?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it is your fault! You told him to come, you let him stay. Everybody hated him, everybody knew he was trouble but you wouldn't listen and you wouldn't send him home and now my daughter is in the hospital!"
"[Luke walks out of the diner and Lorelai follows him]"
"LORELAI: You kept pushing them together. You asked her to help him study, you knew she'd never say no. I told you it made me nervous, I told you I didn't like it and I should've stopped it right there. But you thought Rory would be good for Jess, never mind what he'd be for her. That wasn't important at all, was it?"
"LUKE: Of course it was important."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you put a stop to it at the first sign of trouble? Why didn't you make him leave?"
"LUKE: He's my nephew. I had an obligation to take him in, I had an obligation to care for him."
"LORELAI: You had an obligation to this town and to me and to Rory. Where are you going?"
"LUKE: I have to find out where Jess is."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll tell you where he's not  he's not in the emergency room having him arm plastered up!"
"LUKE: Hey, I am sorry about Rory. You know I care more about her than I do myself, but at least you know where Rory is and at least you know that she's okay. Now, I have to find Jess and I have to make sure that he's okay, and if that cuts into your screaming time, well that's just too damn bad!"
"LORELAI: Go to hell!"
"LUKE: Right back at ya!"
"[Luke walks away. Lorelai sees Rory's car being towed away and starts to cry, then pulls out her cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Chris?"
"CUT TO BRIDGE"
"[Jess is sitting on the bridge as Luke walks up to him]"
"JESS: I made sure she was okay."
"LUKE: I know you did."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is lying in bed, Lorelai stands next to her near a small table of items]"
"LORELAI: Okay, you've got your TV, you've got your books, your magazines, your refreshments, you have your CD player, your assorted CDs. Stan Freberg, Ash, you have your Sinead O'Connor  because when life really gets you down, Sinead's really the one to teach you some perspective. You have a pad of paper in case you decide to write the great American novel. And over here you have a tiny but annoying bell in case there's something here that you need but you don't have and you want to summon the common but lovely house wench who will promptly leave her talking mice and come to fetch the Contessa whatever she may require."
"RORY: I think what Contessa requires right now is sleep."
"LORELAI: Is your arm hurting you?"
"RORY: Unh uh, but the stuff they gave me at the hospital made me a little dopey."
"LORELAI: My little Marianne Faithful. Scooch down now and go to sleep."
"[Lorelai moves Rory's armchair]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Just a little feng shui, go to sleep."
"[Lorelai brings in a pillow and blanket]"
"RORY: Mom, you don't have to sleep in here tonight."
"LORELAI: I know, I just think the chair looks nice here."
"RORY: And what's the blanket for?"
"LORELAI: In case the chair gets cold."
"RORY: And the pillow?"
"LORELAI: To keep the blanket company."
"RORY: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: Okay, everything's in its place. Chair seems warm, blanket seems happy, just one thing missing. . .oh, yeah. [sits down in chair] Goodnight."
"RORY: Freak of sideshow proportions."
"LORELAI: I love you, too."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Hmm?"
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: Shh, the chair is trying to sleep."
"CUT TO LATER THAT NIGHT"
"[Rory is asleep in her bed, Lorelai is asleep in the chair. Lorelai wakes up and finds Christopher sleeping in a chair next to her.]"
"LORELAI: Chris?"
"CHRISTOPHER: [wakes up] What? Lor. . . is everything. . ."
"LORELAI: Shh. Come on."
"[they walk into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Hey, what are you doing here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, I have a really crappy mattress at home."
"LORELAI: Chris."
"CHRISTOPHER: I drove here as fast as I could and I went to the hospital but you guys had already left so I tried your cell phone but all I got was the voice mail so I came here but the place looked dark so I got the key out of the turtle and came in but you guys were already asleep so I just grabbed a chair and. . . and apparently my evil plan worked exactly as I anticipated."
"LORELAI: I'm so glad you're here."
"CHRISTOPHER: Me too. How's she doing?"
"LORELAI: She's in a cast."
"CHRISTOPHER: I know."
"LORELAI: The doctor said she'll be fine, he'll take it off in a couple of weeks. The car is totally gone and I have to call the insurance guy tomorrow and. . .I don't know."
"CHRISTOPHER: Did you find that kid?"
"LORELAI: Jess?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Jess, dead meat, whatever his name is."
"LORELAI: No, the little ferret's hiding out somewhere, I'm sure."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, well, I'm gonna deal with the car tomorrow and I still wanna talk to the doctor, if that's okay, and I'm gonna need a picture of this Jess so I don't accidentally rip the head off the wrong kid cause that would be bad."
"LORELAI: Look at you all springin' into action."
"CHRISTOPHER: About time, don't ya think?"
"LORELAI: I like the superhero you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Just trying to keep up."
"LORELAI: So, are you staying here tonight or do you have to rush back?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No, I wanna spend some time with Rory tomorrow."
"LORELAI: And Sherry's cool with you staying here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Rory comes first."
"LORELAI: Okay. Do you want some coffee?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'll get it."
"LORELAI: Do you know how to make coffee?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: My coffee?"
"CHRISTOPHER: One bag of coffee per cup of water, right?"
"LORELAI: Perfect. Oh my God. When Rory called me tonight and said the word hospital, I just legitimately thought I was having a heart attack, and let me tell you, it was not fun. I'm joining a gym tomorrow, that's how not fun it was."
"CHRISTOPHER: See if you can get a two for one membership."
"LORELAI: Anything could've happened. It could've been so much worse."
"CHRISTOPHER: But it wasn't."
"LORELAI: No, it wasn't, but it could've been."
"CHRISTOPHER: It wasn't. It's okay, everything's gonna be okay."
"LORELAI: Hey, about the fight we had the last time you were here. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yes, that was a doozy, wasn't it?"
"LORELAI: I just, I didn't mean to. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: No, I shouldn't have. . ."
"LORELAI: No, but if I implied that. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: You didn't. . .I just snapped. . ."
"LORELAI: I understand."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: Me too. Hey, did I mention I'm really glad you're here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I believe you did."
"LORELAI: Well, good for me, then."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[On Movie in the Square night, rows of chairs are set up in front of a large movie screen near the gazebo. Lorelai, Christopher, Rory, and Sookie walk toward the seats]"
"CHRISTOPHER: The Yearling?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: Great movie."
"CHRISTOPHER: Boy, you think they could've gotten the genius in charge of this to come up with something other than The Yearling."
"LORELAI: You know, picking a movie that will appeal to a large group of people is hard."
"LANE: Rory!"
"CHRISTOPHER: We'll get seats."
"[Lorelai, Sookie, and Christopher walk away]"
"LANE: Oh my God! Let me see. Oh, that sucks, that so sucks. Does it hurt?"
"RORY: Only when I remember how I got it."
"LANE: Okay. Here  angry girl for an angry arm."
"RORY: Oh, cool! Thank you."
"LANE: You're welcome. [Lane puts a sticker on Rory's cast] So, tell me what happened."
"RORY: Oh, Lane, it was horrible. I have never been involved in anything so horrible in my life."
"LANE: But what happened?"
"RORY: An animal ran out into the road and we swerved and we hit a pole, and my car  my beautiful car. . ."
"LANE: How bad?"
"RORY: Bad."
"LANE: Have you talked to Dean?"
"RORY: No, he gets home tomorrow."
"LANE: What are you gonna say?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LANE: He's gonna freak."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: And Jess?"
"RORY: Not since last night."
"LANE: Wow."
"RORY: Yeah, everyone is so upset right now. And my dad's in town and something happened between Mom and Luke and she won't tell me what. I don't know, they just need time to cool off and then everything will be fine. Everyone just needs time. Maybe I'll try to call him tomorrow."
"LANE: Tomorrow. Oh yeah, that's plenty of time. No one will still be mad then."
"RORY: Sarcasm does not become you."
"LANE: Maybe not, but it does sustain me."
"[cut to Lorelai, Sookie and Christopher finding seats]"
"LORELAI: Hey, why isn't Jackson here?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, he's singing to his persimmons tonight. They've been a little sour lately."
"LORELAI: Oh, right."
"CHRISTOPHER: Right? You just accept that explanation?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, why shouldn't I?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Because she just told you the man isn't here because he's singing to fruit."
"LORELAI: That's better than dancing with it. Remember last year's watermelon crop?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah  threw his back out."
"LORELAI: Mm hmm."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm facing the screen now."
"SOOKIE: The movie's already starting? I thought it started at eight."
"LORELAI: No, this is a little pre-movie treat."
"[On the screen, the words ""a film by kirk"" appear. Kirk and a woman walk up to a house]"
"KIRK: I can't wait to meet your family."
"WOMAN: I'm very close to my family."
"KIRK: I know this. That's why I can't wait to meet your family."
"WOMAN: Remember, Daddy is quite protective. I'm his favorite daughter."
"KIRK: He has good taste. I intend to tell him that."
"WOMAN: I love you."
"[They knock on the door and a man answers]"
"WOMAN: Daddy."
"DAD: You are with my favorite daughter."
"KIRK: You have good taste."
"DAD: Come in the house."
"WOMAN: I love you."
"[inside the house, Kirk, the woman, and her parents sit in chairs in the living room just staring at each other. Finally, Kirk stands up]"
"KIRK: I love your daughter."
"DAD: Who are you to love my daughter? What can you offer her?"
"KIRK: Nothing. Only this. [starts dancing]"
"[cut to the audience]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Wow."
"LORELAI: He raps later."
"SOOKIE: Okay, Jackson needs to see this. Hey, if I can't get him here quick enough. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, we are so playing this again after the movie."
"SOOKIE: Great, I'll be back. [leaves]"
"CHRISTOPHER: This town is like one big outpatient mental institution."
"LORELAI: Glad you could join us."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, me too."
"LORELAI: It's so nice you decided to stay for the movie. I mean, it's really fun being able to say, hey, look, I know that person. I talk to him everyday and so far, he's never bitten me.'"
"CHRISTOPHER: That's it, I'm definitely coming around more often. You need protection."
"LORELAI: Coming around more sounds good."
"CHRISTOPHER: I wish I could stay longer."
"LORELAI: Well, you gotta get back to Sherry. Don't worry, we understand."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well, I wish I could stay."
"[Rory sits down with them]"
"RORY: Hey, where did Sookie go? Oh my Lord."
"LORELAI: Quick, cover her eyes. She's just a child, she shouldn't have to see this."
"RORY: He's taking his shirt off."
"CHRISTOPHER: I shouldn't have to see this either. I'm going for popcorn."
"LORELAI: Me please."
"RORY: Me too."
"CHRISTOPHER: Got it, be right back. [leaves]"
"RORY: I like it when he's here."
"LORELAI: Yeah, me too."
"[on the screen, Kirk finishes dancing and the dad stands up.]"
"DAD: Let's eat."
"[the movie ends and the audience claps. Patty walks up to Lorelai and Rory]"
"MISS PATTY: I did the choreography."
"LORELAI: Mm."
"BABETTE: Patty, doll, come here!"
"MISS PATTY: I'll see you later."
"LORELAI: Bye Patty. [to Rory] So, how are you feeling?"
"RORY: Haunted by the sight of Kirk's bare chest."
"[pan over to Babette and Miss Patty talking]"
"MISS PATTY: No!"
"BABETTE: I swear to God!"
"MISS PATTY: When?"
"BABETTE: Last night, not long after the accident happened, Luke walked him straight to the bus station, stuck the kid on a bus, sent him home to his mom."
"MISS PATTY: I can't believe Luke would send him off like that."
"BABETTE: Well, I heard the kid wanted to go. I don't know. All I know is that Jess is gone."
"MISS PATTY: Well, well, well. What will we do for entertainment around here?"
"BABETTE: b*at the hell outta me."
"[pan over to Lorelai and Rory, who heard the conversation]"

"[Lorelai and Rory are walking past the gazebo toward Luke's]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. Are you tilting?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: I think you're tilting."
"RORY: I'm not tilting."
"LORELAI: Do you wanna hold onto my purse? It might even you out."
"RORY: Stop anytime you like. What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Well, I'm gonna get a pen and put it on top of your head and see if it rolls off."
"RORY: Okay, see, this is not how you console the injured."
"LORELAI: You're right, I'm sorry. [pulls a book out of her purse] How about this?"
"RORY: The Little Locksmith!"
"LORELAI: And I got it at the bookstore, paid full price."
"RORY: Thank you!"
"LORELAI: You're welcome  feel better?"
"RORY: I do."
"LORELAI: Good. . .now can I put a pen on top of your head?"
"RORY: No. Mom?"
"LORELAI: Oh good, hold still."
"RORY: Forget the pen."
"LORELAI: Drat!"
"RORY: When are you gonna tell me what happened between you and Luke? Was it bad? I mean, I'm sure it was bad, but how bad is bad?"
"LORELAI: It was nothing."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Look, I was upset, he was upset, we had a thing. It's over, we're fine."
"RORY: A thing?"
"LORELAI: A tiny thing."
"RORY: A tiny thing?"
"LORELAI: A thinglet, if you will."
"RORY: You and Luke don't have thinglets very often."
"LORELAI: Oh no, Rory, everybody has thinglets, it's part of being a grown up."
"RORY: Well, what did he say? What did you say?"
"LORELAI: Rory, please."
"RORY: Well, okay, fine, just answer me this  we are on our way to Luke's, right?"
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: And when we get there, will we get in?"
"LORELAI: Of course we'll get in."
"RORY: Will we get served?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: Will we get coffee?"
"LORELAI: Maybe."
"RORY: Refills?"
"LORELAI: Eventually."
"RORY: Free refills?"
"LORELAI: In about a month."
"RORY: Okay, the thinglet has grown into a thing."
"LORELAI: Rory, Luke and I have fought before, God knows we'll fight again, but it's over, it's history. We'll go in, he'll be crabby, I'll be adorable, he'll forget everything and that, as they say, will be that."
"RORY: Okay."
"[They reach Luke's Diner  there is a crowd out front]"
"LORELAI: Hey, is there a line?"
"KIRK: Closed."
"LORELAI: What?"
"KIRK: It's closed."
"LORELAI: Luke's is closed?"
"RORY: Luke's is never closed."
"KIRK: I know."
"LORELAI: Are you sure it's closed?"
"KIRK: Well, first I read the sign and then I tried the door in case it was some sort of elaborate ruse."
"LORELAI: Designed to keep only you out?"
"KIRK: There's precedent."
"LORELAI: Well, Luke's gone fishing. I think that's great."
"RORY: It is?"
"LORELAI: Yes. He works hard, he needed a break, he took it. I think it's good, healthy."
"KIRK: For who? I have blood sugar issues."
"RORY: Mom -."
"LORELAI: Don't."
"RORY: It's because -."
"LORELAI: No, it isn't."
"RORY: But he never --."
"LORELAI: Well, now he did."
"RORY: But --."
"LORELAI: Rory, he took a trip. Don't read anything into it."
"RORY: It's because of the other night."
"LORELAI: No, it isn't. And even if it is, it'll go away. Everything'll be fine."
"KIRK: Speak for yourself. I left my wallet in there yesterday."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO THE HUNGRY DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are in another restaurant, standing near the door]"
"LORELAI: Why are we standing here?"
"RORY: Because the sign says wait to be seated'."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but we're not automatons, we are rule breakers, and there are like fifty open tables."
"RORY: You're exaggerating."
"LORELAI: One, two, three, four, fifty  no I'm not."
"RORY: I'm sure someone will help us soon."
"LORELAI: We should be eating, I'm hungry, this is crazy. Don't they want us eating? Isn't that what the point of The Hungry Diner is  to feed the hungry diner? Or is the point of The Hungry Diner to keep the hungry diner hungry, in which case they should call it The Eternally Hungry Diner cause you're not gonna get any food here, loser."
"RORY: That would be quite a sign."
"LORELAI: Ugh, I'm giving one of these paper-topped turkey heads three seconds to seat us or I swear, I'm gonna start to just  ."
"WAITRESS: [walks up to them] Two?"
"LORELAI: Yes, please."
"[they follow the waitress toward a table]"
"RORY: You're gonna what?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Well, you said you were gonna do something if somebody didn't help us in three seconds."
"LORELAI: I did?"
"RORY: Yes, you did, and then the waitress came over and you never finished saying what you were gonna do."
"LORELAI: Honey, we gotta get some food into you, you're imagining things."
"RORY: What were you gonna do?"
"LORELAI: Shh! You're getting screwy!"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Mom? I'm not your mom. Do you need help little girl?"
"RORY: Oh my God."
"WAITRESS: How's this?"
"LORELAI: It's, uh, perfect, thanks."
"WAITRESS: Can I bring you some coffee to start?"
"LORELAI: To start and finish."
"WAITRESS: Need a little pick me up?"
"LORELAI: Do I!"
"WAITRESS: Back in a jif! [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Okay, when she comes back, we're gonna grab her and hold her down and you tell her really ugly things about the world."
"RORY: Why don't you get your daughter to help you out with your evil plan?"
"LORELAI: Okay, now, make nice. [opens menu] Oh, how convenient. They have pictures of all the food in case you've been living in a cave for the last fifty years and you have no idea what a stack of pancakes looks like."
"[waitress brings them their coffee]"
"LORELAI: Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry."
"WAITRESS: Yes, Sweetie?"
"LORELAI: What are the tiny cups for?"
"WAITRESS: They're coffee cups, they're for coffee."
"LORELAI: What, are you running out or something?"
"WAITRESS: I'm sorry?"
"LORELAI: Never mind. Listen, we are very sleepy this morning, so would you happen to have something in a larger size, say a mug, a tureen, a small bowl of some kind?"
"WAITRESS: A coffee bowl?"
"LORELAI: Yes, a coffee bowl."
"RORY: Bring two, please."
"WAITRESS: We don't have coffee bowls, I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, then would you mind bringing. . .what do you think  two, three?"
"RORY: Three's good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, three of these cute little cuppy things? Oh, and could you leave the pot in the meantime?"
"[waitress walks away]"
"LORELAI: Well, looks like coffee, smells like coffee. . ."
"RORY: [takes a sip and makes a face] The comparison stops there!"
"LORELAI: This sucks."
"RORY: Just put a lot of stuff in there so you can't taste it."
"LORELAI: How am I gonna fit my three sugars into Barbie's Malibu dream cup here? It'll be all sugar and no coffee."
"RORY: You may prefer it that way."
"LORELAI: Man. [glances over and sees Michel at another table] Well, well, well."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I'll be right back. [walks over to Michel, who is reading a magazine] So, what's new for Fall? I hear the sailor suit is hot, hot, hot."
"MICHEL: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Luke's is closed this morning."
"MICHEL: By the health inspector, no doubt."
"LORELAI: So. . . this is where you have your breakfast, huh?"
"MICHEL: Until this morning, yes."
"LORELAI: How's the grub?"
"MICHEL: They make an excellent egg white omelet, no oil."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"MICHEL: They use the spray. Can you leave now?"
"LORELAI: How come you never told me about this place?"
"MICHEL: Because then you might actually eat here and there would be no corner of my life which would be free of your incessant scrutiny. What are you doing with the fork?"
"LORELAI: Can I have a bite?"
"MICHEL: Can you what?"
"LORELAI: Just a taste."
"MICHEL: Get away from me. [stands up to leave]"
"LORELAI: Aw, Michel, don't go. Come eat with us."
"MICHEL: You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
"LORELAI: No, not really."
"MICHEL: Good, it's a date."
"LORELAI: You, me, here tomorrow?"
"MICHEL: Never. [leaves]"
"[Lorelai walks back to Rory and sits down]"
"LORELAI: Hey, know what? I'm beginning to like this place."
"RORY: I'm glad. Mom, I need to ask you a favor."
"LORELAI: Ask away."
"RORY: I need you to get me out of dinner tonight."
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory."
"RORY: Dean's coming home and he doesn't know about the accident and if I'm not there the second he gets home then someone else is gonna tell him about it and then that would be  ."
"LORELAI: Horrible."
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: I agree."
"RORY: I really hate to ask you this."
"LORELAI: Ah, forget about it."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, absolutely. Make things right with Dean."
"RORY: I really appreciate this."
"LORELAI: No problem. In fact, it gives me a little extra time to work on my why Rory's wearing a cast' story for your grandparents."
"RORY: Yeah? What do you got so far?"
"LORELAI: Really big bees."
"RORY: Huh. Well, it's good you've got the time."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it is."
"CUT TO FRIDAY NIGHT DINNER"
"[Lorelai and Emily are walking toward the living room]"
"EMILY: I'm so sorry Rory isn't feeling well. Is it that flu that's been going around?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, it is."
"EMILY: Horrible strain. Bunny Carlington-Munchausen has been bedridden for two straight weeks."
"LORELAI: Huh. Well, it must wipe her out just toting that name around."
"EMILY: I wonder if I should take a drink into Richard. I hate to disturb him while he's working."
"LORELAI: He's working, like work working?"
"EMILY: That's right. His articles of incorporation arrived last week. He's rented an office. Your father is now the president and CEO of the Gilmore Group, an international insurance consulting firm."
"LORELAI: Wow, that's great. So, um, what's the. . .like, how does. . . what's his job?"
"EMILY: He's a consultant."
"LORELAI: Meaning?"
"EMILY: Your father is an international insurance consultant."
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, but what exactly does that mean?"
"EMILY: He consults on matters relating to international insurance."
"LORELAI: Wait, wait  when Dad goes to his new office, he sits down and he. . ."
"EMILY: Consults with international clients on insurance matters."
"LORELAI: I don't know why we're not opening for Rickles."
"RICHARD: [from hallway] Dammit!"
"EMILY: Richard, are you all right?"
"RICHARD: [walks into the living room] No, I am not all right. That was Margie just now on the phone."
"EMILY: Oh, how is she?"
"LORELAI: Who is she?"
"EMILY: You know very well who Margie is. She's been your father's secretary since you were a child."
"LORELAI: Oh, Largie Margie. . .very clever when you're six."
"RICHARD: In answer to your question Emily, Margie is well. So well, in fact, that she has decided not to join me in my new business."
"EMILY: What?"
"RICHARD: She's staying with the old firm."
"EMILY: But how could she? You were the only reason she even had a job at that firm."
"RICHARD: I went to great pains to remind her of just that."
"EMILY: Well, this is simply unacceptable. You and that rotund ingrate had an agreement."
"LORELAI: There was an agreement, in writing?"
"RICHARD: Well, not in writing per se, but she helped me procure my new office, she arranged to have all my things sent over, all that was left was for her to accept my formal offer, a very generous one, if I may say so."
"EMILY: And she just turned you down?"
"RICHARD: She had the gall to counteroffer. She kept insisting that I match her current salary."
"LORELAI: Oh, Dad, you weren't even offering to match the poor woman's salary?"
"RICHARD: Well, Lorelai, the Gilmore Group is a fledgling enterprise. I can't afford to pay Margie her full salary right away."
"EMILY: But after twenty years, where is the woman's sense of loyalty?"
"LORELAI: Oh, gee, I don't know. . .maybe with the company that's keeping her from having to stand in line for government cheese."
"RICHARD: I'm afraid, at this point, I don't know how to proceed."
"EMILY: Well, of course you don't."
"RICHARD: I had counted on this."
"EMILY: Of course you had."
"RICHARD: Perhaps I should reconsider going forward."
"EMILY: That may be best."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RICHARD: I can't very well do it without Margie."
"EMILY: No one would expect you to."
"LORELAI: Guys, you can't be serious."
"EMILY: I wonder if it's too late to get out of my lease."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: You should look into that immediately, Richard."
"LORELAI: Whoa, whoa, whoa! There is a baby here desperately in need of some bath water."
"RICHARD: What is she saying Emily?"
"EMILY: What are you saying Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: I'm just saying there are other options to consider."
"RICHARD: Like what?"
"LORELAI: Like hire another secretary."
"EMILY: Oh no. Your father's had other secretaries."
"RICHARD: Three in fact, each one worse than the previous one."
"EMILY: Until Margie."
"RICHARD: Margie was a gem."
"EMILY: Margie did everything for him."
"LORELAI: Yes, but Dad, there are plenty of other Margie's out there dying to be in that kind of codependent relationship with you. You will find one, trust me. Now she might not be named Margie but if you pay her enough you can probably call her whatever you want."
"RICHARD: I don't have time to find someone new. The office is a disaster. Everything is in boxes. I don't know where anything is or how anything works. . . the computers, the phones, even my office chair."
"LORELAI: Okay, Dad, I'll tell you what. Tomorrow afternoon after my business class, I will come to your office and we'll get you unpacked, we'll get you settled, and we'll find you someone as good as Margie, or at least cheaper."
"RICHARD: Oh, I hate to see you waste your time."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll blindfold you then."
"RICHARD: I don't know, I  ."
"LORELAI: Dad, there's another Margie out there, honest. Just give it a chance."
"RICHARD: An office without Margie. . ."
"EMILY: Seems inconceivable."
"LORELAI: Dream with me here folks."
"CUT TO DEAN'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is sitting on the porch as Dean and his dad pull up in an SUV]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN'S DAD: Hi Rory. [goes into the house]"
"DEAN: What happened? What'd you do to your arm?"
"RORY: [hands him an envelope] Here."
"DEAN: What is this?"
"RORY: Just read it."
"DEAN: What  Rory, what's going on? Tell me how you hurt your arm."
"RORY: It's all in the letter."
"DEAN: But  ."
"RORY: Read."
"DEAN: Uh. . .[starts reading] Well, I love you, too."
"RORY: Good  now just hold onto that feeling for a minute."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: Just  ."
"DEAN: Read, all right, I'm reading. [reads some more] What?"
"RORY: Keep going."
"DEAN: [reads some more] What?"
"RORY: Turn it over."
"DEAN: [reads some more] What!"
"RORY: Go on, you have like three more whats ahead of you."
"[Dean kicks his duffel bag and reads some more]"
"RORY: It gets better at the end. I'll just stand here until you get there."
"DEAN: [reads some more] Is he really gone?"
"RORY: Yes."
"DEAN: Okay. You wanna come in?"
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: You can stay for dinner, my mom's making a roast. You like roast, right?"
"RORY: Um, yeah, I like roast."
"DEAN: Okay, come on."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the kitchen table. Lorelai is covering Rory's cast with a plastic bag]"
"RORY: And then we just watched TV."
"LORELAI: Oh, you mean you watched TV.' Use the air quotes, Sweetie."
"RORY: His little sister was there."
"LORELAI: Oh, so you watched TV. . .go on."
"RORY: And then he walked me home."
"LORELAI: That's it?"
"RORY: That's it."
"LORELAI: Did he kiss you goodnight?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: But he didn't ask about the other night at all?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Didn't ask about the car?"
"RORY: Not once."
"LORELAI: And Jess?"
"RORY: He just asked if he was really gone and that was it."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"RORY: I thought he would yell and scream. I though he would wanna break up  instead, he gave me his corn."
"LORELAI: He did? When?"
"RORY: At dinner."
"LORELAI: Oh, so you were already eating. It wasn't just an out of the blue, And I give you my corn.' Okay, got it."
"RORY: Maybe it just hasn't sunk in yet, maybe he'll be mad tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Maybe Dean is even more terrific than we thought he was."
"RORY: It's not covering the whole cast."
"LORELAI: Relax, I'm not done. [gets a box of Saran wrap]"
"RORY: Do you really think he's okay with it?"
"LORELAI: Sounds like it."
"RORY: If the situation were reversed, I don't think I'd be okay with it."
"LORELAI: If the situation was reversed, I don't think Dean would've let Jess drive his car."
"RORY: I guess I should just be grateful then?"
"LORELAI: Grateful, absolutely."
"RORY: [points to a stack of papers] What are these?"
"LORELAI: These are resumes for your Grandpa's new secretary."
"RORY: There are like a hundred of them."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, the world is full of eager young people just waiting to have the life sucked out of them by Richard Gilmore. Okay, I'm finished  what do you think of that?"
"RORY: If we were gazelles, we'd be the first ones eaten at the watering hole."
"LORELAI: Well, be thankful we're not gazelles. Now go take your shower. You're starting to look like you're starring in an independent film."
"[Rory starts to leave the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Hey?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Dean knows ya, hon. He knows you wouldn't do anything to hurt him, he gets it. So, you're lucky, just focus on that. Jess is gone, now you guys can start over."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: And, uh, hey, even though the box says it's safe, I want you to keep your arm out of the microwave for at least a week."
"CUT TO RICHARD'S OFFICE"
"[Lorelai walks into an office crowded with boxes]"
"LORELAI: Dad?"
"RICHARD: Oh, come in, come in."
"LORELAI: So, let me guess, the Wu Tang Clan had the office before you?"
"RICHARD: Yeah, it's a bit disheveled, I know."
"LORELAI: Wow, it's freezing in here."
"RICHARD: Uh, yes, it has been since I moved in."
"LORELAI: Oh, did you try adjusting the thermostat?"
"RICHARD: Yes, that only seemed to make it angry."
"LORELAI: So you've been just Nanooking it this whole time, just sending out for whale blubber and mukluks? [adjusts thermostat]"
"RICHARD: Well, I wouldn't touch that if I were you, Lorelai. You don't know what you're do ."
"LORELAI: Ah, the wind done gone."
"RICHARD: So it would seem, for the moment."
"LORELAI: No, no, I turned it off. Here, let me show you. [the phone rings] Do you wanna get that?"
"RICHARD: No, no, they've already hung up."
"[phone stops ringing]"
"LORELAI: Okay, next time hold an envelope up to your head before you do that."
"RICHARD: Well, it's been doing it all day. The phone rings once, and then poof, they're gone."
"LORELAI: [walks over to the phone] Oh, that's because your messages are being forwarded to your voice mail. See where it says voice mail."
"RICHARD: How could that happen?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, where's your manual?"
"RICHARD: Uh, manual. . manual. . ."
"LORELAI: Uh, came with the phone, probably has a picture of a phone on it. Aha, look what I found under your copper ball glued to the wood thing here."
"RICHARD: Uh, it's brass. One of the firm's parting gifts as they nudged me into retirement."
"LORELAI: So, in addition to being heavy and ugly, it's also insulting."
"RICHARD: Quite."
"LORELAI: There you go, that should work. You wanna call me from your office?"
"RICHARD: Well, this is my office."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, whose office is that? [points toward an adjoining room]"
"RICHARD: Ah, yes, excellent idea. [walks toward the other office as the phone rings] That isn't me calling."
"LORELAI: Didn't think so. Should I get that?"
"RICHARD: Yes, please."
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Um, hello, the Gilmore Group. Mr. Hensen. . . why, yes, he..."
"RICHARD: Ooh! [gestures that he doesn't want to talk]"
"LORELAI: ...just walked out. May I take a message? Uh huh. . . [looks through the drawers for a pen] Um, how are you spelling, uh, Larry? [Richard hands her a pen] Oh, traditionally, great. Okay, uh, thank you for calling. . .bye bye. [hangs up] Where the hell are your pens?"
"RICHARD: Uh, watch your language, young lady. What did Larry want?"
"LORELAI: He wanted to know where the hell your pens are."
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: He just wants you to call him, Dad. Where are all the office supplies?"
"RICHARD: Well, I haven't gotten around to that yet."
"LORELAI: Before anything else can happen, you need pens, you need paper, you need. . . everything else, don't you? Especially since I might be tempted to wash my hand at some point."
"RICHARD: Well, where does one get these things?"
"LORELAI: Well, Dad, where did you used to get them?"
"RICHARD: From Margie."
"LORELAI: From Margie. . .I saw that coming. All right, well, let's go."
"CUT TO OFFICE SUPPLY STORE"
"[Lorelai pushes a cart down an aisle as Richard follows behind her]"
"RICHARD: Good Lord, this place goes on forever."
"LORELAI: Oh, it goes on until chair mats and floor mats but if you're not careful, you'll loop back around into inks and toners and be here all day. Stay close. Hey, there's a seat in the cart if you want a ride."
"RICHARD: I'll pass. Look at the scale of this place. I mean, no one needs all these options, it's oppressive. Hundreds of paper clips in every conceivable color and size. Now, who on Earth would buy these things?"
"LORELAI: We would. [puts them in the cart] All right, now, what's the first thing you do when you get to the office in the morning?"
"RICHARD: Uh, well, let's see, I return the calls from Asia first."
"[walk over to a row of coffee makers]"
"LORELAI: That's right, you make coffee, so you'll need a coffee maker. Let's see. Ugly, crappy, German, ooh - pretty!"
"RICHARD: Oh, well, as long as it's pretty."
"LORELAI: Why is everything worth having just out of reach?"
"RICHARD: Is there no one here whose job it is to actually assist paying customers?"
"LORELAI: No, that's how they can afford to sell this baby for forty percent off."
"RICHARD: Forty percent off, I had no idea. [grabs the box from the top shelf and puts it in the cart]"
"LORELAI: Nicely done, Dad. You won't be sorry."
"RICHARD: You know, it's suddenly becoming clear to me that I'm an old man. I don't recognize half the whats-its and dodads in here."
"LORELAI: Well, Dad, here we have an assortment of magic sticks and when you press down on paper, writing comes out."
"RICHARD: I know what pens are, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Good, you pick out your favorites and I'll try to figure out how to explain Liquid Paper to you."
"[Richard picks up a couple of pens]"
"LORELAI: Oh, you're cute."
"[Lorelai picks up several boxes of pens]"
"RICHARD: I can't possibly use all of those."
"LORELAI: You won't. You'll lose half of them, then you'll be really happy to have the ones you have left. Now, paper."
"RICHARD: All right. This oughta do nicely for now. [picks out a small package of paper]"
"LORELAI: What, are you going into business for two weeks? You are building an empire for crying out loud. Think big, Gilmore! Plus, if you get the box, it's cheaper. [puts huge box of paper into the cart]"
"RICHARD: Say, how do you happen to know all of this?"
"LORELAI: It's how we do it at the inn. You have to spend money to make money, my friend. It's a little tip from me to you."
"RICHARD: Good point. What else?"
"LORELAI: I'd strongly recommend a stapler."
"RICHARD: Stapler."
"LORELAI: Some extra staples."
"RICHARD: Ah, I'm way ahead of you."
"LORELAI: Good man. Post-Its."
"RICHARD: My goodness, look at all the Post-Its. I had no idea they came in so many shapes and colors. I'm gonna get a twelve pack for myself in various hues."
"LORELAI: Wise move."
"RICHARD: And one for Emily. I have seen her post notes on her vanity mirror to remind her of various activities."
"LORELAI: Ah, she'll think it's Christmas."
"RICHARD: Done. Now, what else is on the hit parade?"
"LORELAI: Well, it might be controversial, but I was thinking of something in the way of a three-hole punch if we can find one."
"RICHARD: Well, I think we're both up to the challenge. Shall we?"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street.]"
"LANE: Dawn Powell? I've never heard of her."
"RORY: Nobody has, which is a shame because she wrote sixteen amazing novels, nine plays, and there are some who actually claim that it was Powell who made the jokes that Dorothy Parker got credit for."
"LANE: Blasphemy."
"RORY: I know. I'm trying not to hold it against Dawn though, until I have proof that she was involved with the whole smear campaign."
"[they walk past an empty shop]"
"LANE: Hey, look! They finally took the boards off the windows."
"RORY: Oh, I wonder what it's going to be."
"LANE: I don't know."
"[they look through a window]"
"RORY: What's that in the corner?"
"LANE: I think it's. . .a bass. It's a bass! And look, there are guitars on the wall! Oh my God, it's a music shop!"
"RORY: Wow, that is much better than the ceramic circus store we thought was going in there."
"LANE: I can't believe it. Stars Hollow has taken its first steps toward being cool. I wonder how soon it's going to open."
"RORY: If you keep pushing on the glass like that, much sooner than anticipated. Hey, hold on a sec?"
"LANE: Why, what's wrong?"
"RORY: Nothing, I'll be right back. [walks across the street to Taylor] Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Rory, hello!"
"RORY: Hi. Listen, I just wanted to  ."
"TAYLOR: Oh no, just look at that arm!"
"RORY: It's fine, really."
"TAYLOR: Does it hurt?"
"RORY: No, not much."
"TAYLOR: Well, I hope you're not getting addicted to k*ll like those Hollywood people do."
"RORY: Um, I'm not, don't worry."
"TAYLOR: Good, because pain is your body's way of saying I'm not okay now, but I will be soon.'"
"RORY: I will remember that."
"TAYLOR: You don't wanna shut your body up too soon. That's called death."
"RORY: Right. Um, Taylor, listen, I just wanted to apologize to you."
"TAYLOR: About what?"
"RORY: About the other night. You know, my car hit the bench that had your brand new Doose's Market sign on it and I know how much that sign meant to you and I'm just so, so sorry that it was ruined."
"TAYLOR: Oh, well, it wasn't your fault."
"RORY: But my car hit the bench."
"TAYLOR: Your car hit the bench because that Jess was driving."
"RORY: Oh, well, yeah, but  ."
"TAYLOR: That boy is a walking natural disaster, they should name a tornado after him."
"RORY: But he didn't cause it Taylor, there was "
"TAYLOR: Rory, you don't have to explain a thing to me. I know that there is absolutely no way that you would be involved in something like that if it weren't for that Sal Mineo wannabe, believe me. Chachi, and Chachi alone, will be held responsible for that incident, okay? Good. Now take a peach."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Taylor walks away as Lane walks over]"
"LANE: So, is he mad?"
"RORY: No, not at me."
"LANE: Well, that's good."
"RORY: Yeah, that's good."
"CUT TO SOPHIE'S MUSIC"
"[Lane walks into the new music store. Kirk is standing at the counter talking to the owner]"
"KIRK: That's my home phone number, my pager number, my cell number, and there's a partial list of references."
"SOPHIE: Yeah, okay, I'll hang onto this, but as I said before, we just opened, so I'm not really looking to hire anybody right now."
"KIRK: I am licensed to carry a g*n, if that'll help."
"SOPHIE: You have no idea how much."
"[Lane walks over to a wall of guitars and starts to touch one]"
"SOPHIE: Can I help you?"
"LANE: Oh, no thank you. I was just looking."
"SOPHIE: We like the looking, it's the touching we're a little iffy on."
"LANE: Actually, I was just going. . .[almost bumps into a cello] That probably would've been construed as touching, huh?"
"SOPHIE: Yes."
"LANE: Right. [stops to look at a drum set] Oh my."
"SOPHIE: That's a DW drum set with Zildjian cymbals."
"LANE: It's beautiful"
"SOPHIE: Do you play?"
"LANE: Oh, no. I wish."
"SOPHIE: Sit."
"LANE: What?"
"SOPHIE: Sit down, see how it feels."
"LANE: Oh, I couldn't."
"SOPHIE: Why, your legs don't bend?"
"LANE: No, they bend."
"SOPHIE: Okay, if they bend then bend them."
"LANE: Well, okay. [sits down] This is a good stool."
"SOPHIE: Yes, it is. Here, you can't sit down at a drum set without your sticks."
"LANE: Right  cause that would be stupid."
"SOPHIE: And remember  no touching."
"LANE: Right. [pretends to play the drums]"
"SOPHIE: You look good."
"LANE: Thanks."
"CUT TO RICHARD'S OFFICE"
"[Richard is on the phone while Lorelai stacks his bookshelves]"
"RICHARD: Well, granted the European insurance market still needs some restructuring but it's growing at a remarkable rate. What am I basing it on? Well, Clive, surely you've seen the latest EuroStat. Yes, I've got it right in front of me. [whispers to Lorelai] EuroStat!"
"[Lorelai hands him a booklet]"
"RICHARD: Ah, yes, here it is. Let's see. Uh, the highest contributions in absolute terms were reached in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands. Uh huh. Well, yes, I would have to look up those specific coding and reference numbers. [Lorelai brings over some books for him] Uh huh, yes, I've got them right here. Mm hmm. For the year, uh, 2001. . . uh, here they are. Uh, yes, are you interested in the Netherlands? I think that's a market that's gonna go through the roof."
"[the phone rings in the other office, Lorelai goes to answer it]"
"LORELAI: Gilmore Group, may I help you? Oh, no, Margie doesn't work for the company anymore. I'm the one who called to schedule the DSL appointment. Well, no, no, we really need the DSL line installed today, it's just awful being without it. Uh huh. Okay, well, um, if you can make it before five, everything's good, but any later than that won't work because the cable modem people are dropping by about 5:05, so. . . well, thank you, that's great. Okay, bye bye. [hangs up] They'll be here in twenty minutes."
"RICHARD: I must say, I'm impressed."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm no Margie."
"RICHARD: Oh, who needs here?"
"LORELAI: Speaking of which. [hands him a stack of papers]"
"RICHARD: What's all this?"
"LORELAI: The secretarial candidates for tomorrow's interviews. I've looked through them pretty carefully, and I think somewhere in there is a Margie for the new millennium."
"[phone rings]"
"RICHARD: I'll get it."
"LORELAI: No, get to know your new secretary, I don't mind. [answers phone] Gilmore Group, may I help you?"
"EMILY: Yes, Richard Gilmore, please."
"LORELAI: [in high voice] Oh, um, uh, certainly, may I ask who's calling?"
"EMILY: Emily Gilmore."
"LORELAI: And does he know what this is about?"
"EMILY: Well, I hope so, I'm his wife."
"LORELAI: [giggles] Oh, but Richard didn't say anything about being married."
"EMILY: What!"
"LORELAI: Mom, relax, it's me."
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: Well, you're crude and unprofessional."
"LORELAI: Well, I'd like that on my tombstone, please. Now what can I do for you?"
"EMILY: I'm throwing a little cocktail party at the office on Friday to help launch the new business. Now, the caterers will be arriving at three o'clock sharp to set up, so  are you writing this down? You should be writing this down."
"LORELAI: I'm scribbling furiously."
"EMILY: Margie always wrote everything down."
"LORELAI: So does this mean no Friday night dinner?"
"EMILY: It means we'll see you both at the party."
"LORELAI: Bye."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Rory walks across the yard as Babette rushes over to her]"
"BABETTE: Oh! Rory, Sweetie, hold on there, baby!"
"RORY: Hey Babette. Is everything okay?"
"BABETTE: I should be asking you that question. Come here, let me see that arm. Oh, you poor little thing. How you doing, huh?"
"RORY: I'm doing fine."
"BABETTE: Aw, look at ya, being brave like that after all you've been through. Geez, it's so hard being a woman, isn't it?"
"RORY: I guess."
"BABETTE: I mean, you've got your morals and your standards and your good common sense and then bam! You meet some guy and all that goes right out the window."
"RORY: But  ."
"BABETTE: For every good woman there's a dirty little wolf just ready to lead her astray. You can't help it, he's got the eyes, the chin, the chest hair you could carpet your dining room with. . .I mean, what's a woman to do? We're not made of steel for God's sake."
"RORY: Babette "
"BABETTE: I was in a cult once, did I tell you that?"
"RORY: No."
"BABETTE: I met this guy once  gorgeous, tan, looked just like Mickey Holiday. We had coffee, he gave me a pamphlet. Next thing you know, I'm wearing a muumuu, playing a tambourine, jumping up and down at the airport."
"RORY: Okay, I really have to get inside."
"BABETTE: Oh, sure, honey, sure, you go take good care of yourself. And don't be embarrassed tutz, this has happened to all of us."
"CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: Mom, you here? [walks over to answering machine and plays a message]"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey you, it's me. I'm gonna be home a little late today  still trying to find Grandpa a Margie. So order pizza, money's under the rabbi, hope your arm's feeling okay, Sweets. Buh-bye."
"[Rory gets some from money under a rabbi doll on the desk, then walks to the kitchen and gets a soda from the refrigerator. The phone rings]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LANE: I have found my calling."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LANE: I am talking about my future, my path, my destiny, my thing, my scene, my bag. I'm talking about the number one item on my cosmic to-do list."
"RORY: Which is?"
"LANE: I'm gonna be a drummer!"
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LANE: I went into that new music store today -- I don't know why I went in, I just had to. Something told me, Lane Kim, there's something in there that you need to see', and there it was, and it was red and shiny and I'm so excited I can't breathe."
"RORY: That's amazing."
"LANE: I know."
"RORY: But how are you gonna do this?"
"LANE: I don't know."
"RORY: How are you gonna buy a drum set?"
"LANE: I don't know."
"RORY: And even if you do buy a drum set, where are you gonna play it?"
"LANE: I don't know, I don't know any of this. But I will figure something out, because I am Keith Moon, I am Neil Peart, I am Rick Allen, with and without the arm, because I am rock 'n' roll, baby! I'll call you later."
"CUT TO RICHARD'S OFFICE"
"[Lorelai and Richard are interviewing a secretarial candidate]"
"KAREN: So when she opened her own office, she asked me to come along as her executive assistant and office manager, which was a terrific opportunity."
"LORELAI: I bet! How so?"
"KAREN: In that I was able to build that office and its staff from the ground up and develop a system from scratch."
"LORELAI: Wow, so you have a system."
"KAREN: Which helped double productivity and billing hours, but then she got pregnant, and well, here we are."
"LORELAI: Wow, story of my life  literally."
"RICHARD: Well, uh, thank you for coming in, uh. . .uh, Karen. Uh, we'll let you know once we make our decision."
"KAREN: Thank you, Mr. Gilmore. It was a pleasure meeting you both."
"LORELAI: Here, I'll walk you out. I love what's going on with your shoes, by the way. [walks Karen out, then returns with a bag] Hey, look what I found."
"RICHARD: Oh, good, lunch, I'm starving. Uh, do you wanna eat in here today?"
"LORELAI: Sure, why not?"
"RICHARD: Oh, good, they threw in pickles like I asked. It's great having this place just across the street, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: You'll never starve."
"RICHARD: Hm, maybe we should start a tab with them so we don't have to pay cash everyday."
"LORELAI: Already done."
"RICHARD: Amazing. You're like the tiny fellow on that Mash program, always anticipating."
"LORELAI: So, what do we think?"
"RICHARD: Mm, that's tasty."
"LORELAI: No, I mean about Karen."
"RICHARD: Who?"
"LORELAI: Karen, the woman who was just here, the one with the system."
"RICHARD: Mm, rather inexperienced, I thought."
"LORELAI: Dad, she worked as an executive assistant for six years."
"RICHARD: Well, she's young, and young women tend to be flighty."
"LORELAI: She worked for the same woman for five of those six years."
"RICHARD: This roast beef is delicious. It's lean, it's tender. What'd you get?"
"LORELAI: Cheeseburger."
"RICHARD: Mm, I may get one of those myself if we order from the same place tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow?"
"RICHARD: Mm hmm."
"LORELAI: You mean for more secretary interviews?"
"RICHARD: Well, whatever's on the agenda."
"LORELAI: Dad, you've already seen like three people who would be absolutely perfect for the job."
"RICHARD: You can't rush these things, Lorelai. A man's secretary sets the tone for the entire enterprise."
"LORELAI: I know that, but "
"RICHARD: It has to do with chemistry as much as anything else, which cannot be manufactured out of sheer necessity. Besides, you and I seem to be doing just fine for the moment."
"LORELAI: Yes, for the moment, but the moment is coming to a rapid end."
"RICHARD: Well, what do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I can't work here cause I have my own job."
"RICHARD: I know that, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: And I need you to find an assistant soon, like now because I don't even know when I'm gonna be able to come back."
"RICHARD: Well, I need to see more resumes. In the meantime, "
"LORELAI: Dad, I cannot come back here tomorrow."
"RICHARD: I see."
"LORELAI: I didn't mean that to sound so harsh. I just. . .I meant "
"RICHARD: I know exactly what you meant to say, Lorelai. I got the message. Well, I won't keep you any longer, I know how busy you are."
"LORELAI: Dad, I didn't mean I have to go right now. We can finish our lunch."
"RICHARD: Oh, I'm finished. Will you leave the phone number of the sandwich shop for me, please? I'll need it."
"LORELAI: All the numbers you need are right there on your desk."
"RICHARD: Oh, good. Now, if you will excuse me, I have some of my own work to attend to. Thank you for all your help."
"LORELAI: You know, Dad, if it makes any difference, I thought that Karen was "
"RICHARD: Thank you."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai gets some food from a takeout window]"
"LORELAI: Here."
"RORY: You know, there will be food there."
"LORELAI: Finger food, aka snooty little balls of attitude."
"RORY: Oh boy."
"LORELAI: I need real food, peasant food. Hearty bread, meat, cheese, a little pickle chips, a sauce, a special sauce. This is the food that sustains me, this is the food of my "
"RORY: Oh my God, just eat the burger already!"
"LORELAI: How crabby."
"RORY: I'm not crabby."
"LORELAI: I didn't even get through my special sauce speech. That's crabby."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Does your arm hurt?"
"RORY: No, I'm just tired, I guess."
"LORELAI: All right. We won't stay very long. Just long enough to get five or six withering stares from my dad, and be taken down three or four notches by my mother, then we're outta there. [takes a bite of her burger] Ugh."
"RORY: Not good?"
"LORELAI: Really not good! I swear, Luke better come back soon or I'm gonna starve to death."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RORY: Luke's gone because of me."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, he is not."
"RORY: Yes, he is. I got into an accident and then you guys had a fight."
"LORELAI: Rory, it isn't your fault. If it's anyone's fault. . ."
"RORY: It's Jess' fault."
"LORELAI: Well, yes."
"RORY: Why does everyone in this town think that it is all Jess' fault?"
"LORELAI: Hey, let's not talk about this, okay?"
"RORY: I was there too, you know."
"LORELAI: Rory, everyone here loves you. They know you're not the get in an accident and knock over a bench' girl."
"RORY: I know that, and I appreciate that, but "
"LORELAI: I want you to stop b*at yourself up about this. It's over, Jess is gone. Let's forget about this, okay, please?"
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Good. Hey, hand me that burger again."
"RORY: I thought you said it was bad."
"LORELAI: Hey, that burger may be a disgusting burger but at least it considers me its equal. Ugh."
"CUT TO RICHARD'S OFFICE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into the crowded office]"
"LORELAI: Oh geez. This is worse than the clowns in the Volkswagen."
"RORY: A lot of people."
"LORELAI: Yeah, do you want something to drink? I think we're three martinis behind everyone else."
"RORY: Just water, I guess."
"LORELAI: Coming up. [walks toward the drinks] Oh boy, I should've brought bread crumbs. Excuse me."
"EMILY: Lorelai, there you are. You're late."
"LORELAI: Well, you scheduled this beer bash during rush hour."
"EMILY: When traffic is leaving Hartford."
"LORELAI: Apparently not when Emily Gilmore is throwing a party."
"EMILY: It's wonderful, isn't it? Everyone showing up for your father."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Mom, but don't you ever think about scaling back a little?"
"EMILY: I scaled back a lot. I cut two appetizers, I canceled the champagne fountain, and I reduced the catering staff to six servers, not counting the pointman."
"LORELAI: Well, you can't not have a pointman cause then what's the point?"
"EMILY: If you make it look cheap, people will think you're unsuccessful."
"LORELAI: Absolutely right. Better to deprive them of oxygen so they don't have to think at all."
"EMILY: It is rather warm in here, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, do you want me to get the air going?"
"EMILY: No, no, Karen knows how to do it."
"LORELAI: Karen?"
"EMILY: Your father's new secretary. She's wonderful, very professional. [walks over to Karen] Karen, darling, would you mind turning on the air conditioning?"
"[pan over to Richard and a man talking]"
"RICHARD: No, I'll have Karen draw up the contracts today. That'll be in the morning."
"[The man walks away, Lorelai walks over]"
"LORELAI: Hi Dad."
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Swell party."
"RICHARD: Uh, yes, it's mostly your mother's doing."
"LORELAI: So, um, what just went down there?"
"RICHARD: Down where?"
"LORELAI: Just now, the handshake with the man in the gray flannel suit  did you score a deal?"
"RICHARD: Well, one doesn't score deals in the insurance business, Lorelai. One builds relationships based on trust and fulfilling the client's needs."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RICHARD: Mr. Lundquist and I, uh, just were -"
"LORELAI: Uh, Mr. Lundquist?"
"RICHARD: Yes."
"LORELAI: Lundquist from Aero International?"
"RICHARD: Yes."
"LORELAI: You bagged the Swede?"
"RICHARD: Well, just as I didn't score the deal, I also haven't bagged the Swede. We simply talked, we came to an agreement, we shook hands."
"LORELAI: You shook hands, that means "
"RICHARD: I'm sending him the contracts in the morning."
"LORELAI: Dad, that's big!"
"RICHARD: Yes, I suppose it is big."
"LORELAI: That's gigantic! It's a whole new market for you. It opens up all of Scandinavia, doesn't it?"
"RICHARD: Beyond that. Lundquist is his company's rep for Russia as well."
"LORELAI: Russia!"
"RICHARD: Da!"
"LORELAI: Look who's taking over the world."
"RICHARD: I suppose that would be me."
"LORELAI: I see that you hired Karen."
"RICHARD: Uh, yes, well, I had to get someone in here."
"LORELAI: She seems to be working out well."
"RICHARD: Well, she's no. . .Margie, but we'll see. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have several more deals to score now that I have finished bagging the Swede."
"[Richard walks away and Emily walks over]"
"LORELAI: He's really in his element, isn't it?"
"EMILY: And happier than he's been in years. Oh, there's Rory. I was wondering where she's  what's that on her arm?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I was gonna tell you about that."
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"LORELAI: That is a cast. She hurt her arm."
"EMILY: When? How bad is it?"
"RORY: I fractured my wrist."
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: It's just a hairline fracture. . .it's just tiny."
"EMILY: When did this happen?"
"LORELAI: Um, last week."
"EMILY: Last week? Why didn't you call me? Last week, I can't believe you."
"LORELAI: Um, well, I meant to."
"EMILY: How did this happen?"
"LORELAI: Bees."
"RORY: I got in a car accident."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I got in a car accident."
"EMILY: Oh my God, how could you not tell us that she got into a car accident? Is this why she missed dinner? You said she had the flu."
"LORELAI: I just didn't want you to worry, Mom."
"EMILY: Yes, well, clearly there was nothing to worry about. It was that car, wasn't it? The one her boyfriend made. Richard was dead set against letting her drive that death mobile."
"LORELAI: No, it wasn't the car, Mom."
"EMILY: Well, then what was it?"
"RORY: A friend of mine and I went to get ice cream"
"EMILY: A friend? Which friend  Lane?"
"RORY: Jess."
"EMILY: Jess?"
"RORY: Luke's nephew."
"EMILY: Him? I thought you were going to keep that boy away from her."
"LORELAI: Mom, do we have to talk about this now?"
"EMILY: Yes, we have to talk about this now. The child has a cast on her arm. I don't understand how you could've been so irresponsible."
"LORELAI: Mom, please."
"EMILY: Don't Mom, please' me. It was your responsibility to stop this, it was your responsibility to make sure that he did not "
"RORY: I gave him the keys. I told him to drive. He wanted to drive back to Luke's and I said no. I wanted to keep on driving and that's when we got into the car accident. This is just as much my fault as it is his, maybe more."
"EMILY: Rory."
"LORELAI: I've got this, Mom. Can I see you in the hall for a second? [they walk into the hallway] Hey, what the hell was that?"
"RORY: I'm sick of this. I'm sick of everyone treating me like I'm some kind of mindless idiot being led around by a guy."
"LORELAI: No one is treating you like that."
"RORY: Everyone is, the whole town is. . . Taylor, Babette, Dean. Everyone in my life, including you, is refusing to believe that I was just as responsible for what happened that night as Jess was."
"LORELAI: Really? Were you driving the car?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Then you weren't as responsible."
"RORY: What if it'd been Dean, huh? What if Dean had been driving? Would everyone be assuming that it was his fault?"
"LORELAI: No, because if Dean had been driving there wouldn't have been an accident because Dean is a much more responsible kid who loves you and would've been driving more responsibly."
"RORY: How do you know that Jess wasn't?"
"LORELAI: Hi. . .it's Jess."
"RORY: Oh, right, Jess is the antichrist, I forgot. He wanted to get into an accident. He was looking for something to hit because he's a m*rder with a death wish and he wanted to k*ll us both, right?"
"LORELAI: I know you think that Jess is your friend, but he's not. He is a completely out of control, really angry kid who has no respect for Luke, who has no respect for me. . ."
"RORY: It was an accident!"
"LORELAI: And he was driving!"
"RORY: So, what, no matter what I say, you're just gonna choose to blame Jess?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I choose to blame Jess."
"RORY: Just because you hate him?"
"LORELAI: That's right! I'm sorry, but when my daughter comes home broken I get to hate the guy who broke her. That's how it works. He's gone, I win. You are wearing a cast and I get to hate him forever!"
"RORY: Fine!"
"LORELAI: Fine!"
"RORY: Fine!"
"LORELAI: I just had this image of thirty-five businessmen, six servers, one pointman all leaning up against that wall with glasses to their ears."
"RORY: I don't think they needed the glasses."
"LORELAI: We've got good lungs, you and I."
"RORY: We're never gonna agree on this."
"LORELAI: You have to understand -"
"RORY: I do."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: I don't wanna fight about this anymore."
"LORELAI: Neither do I. Do you wanna go back inside?"
"RORY: No, I wanna go home. My wrist hurts and I'm grumpy and I just made a total idiot of myself in there so I just wanna go home."
"LORELAI: All right, well, I'll tell Mom, I'll drive you."
"RORY: No, it's okay. It's still early. I can catch my regular bus and. . .you go back in."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I just want some alone time now."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'll see you back at home."
"CUT TO SOPHIE'S MUSIC"
"[Lane is staring at the drum set]"
"SOPHIE: It's after six, we're closed."
"LANE: Five more minutes?"
"SOPHIE: Nope, now."
"LANE: So, you're from New York, huh?"
"SOPHIE: Yes, I am."
"LANE: I wanna go to New York someday."
"SOPHIE: Good for you."
"LANE: Did you like it there?"
"SOPHIE: It was all right."
"LANE: What part of New York did you live in?"
"SOPHIE: Okay, look, what's your name?"
"LANE: Lane Kim."
"SOPHIE: Very nice to meet you, Lane Kim. Now you have got to get out of here because I am going to close and you are not going to schmooze me into forgetting that I am going to close."
"LANE: Wait?"
"SOPHIE: What?"
"LANE: I have to have those drums."
"SOPHIE: Great  cash or credit?"
"LANE: No, see, I have no money. Plus, even if I did have money there's no way I could take those home with me because my mother would never stop crying, so I have a proposal."
"SOPHIE: Uh huh."
"LANE: Twice a week, on Wednesday and Friday nights at six o'clock, I could come and practice here."
"SOPHIE: Wow, that sounds great."
"LANE: Now, I'm not expecting you to let me do this for free or anything. I'll clean or do inventory or stock stuff or whatever it is that you need done."
"SOPHIE: I don't need that much done."
"LANE: Well, then, I can do other things also, like, uh. . .oh, hey, do you know Korean?"
"SOPHIE: No."
"LANE: Well, then I could teach you."
"SOPHIE: Why would I wanna learn Korean?"
"LANE: Why wouldn't you? It's an interesting language, and being bilingual in this day and age can only be a plus."
"SOPHIE: Please, go home."
"LANE: I can't. I can't go home until you say yes. I have to rock, I have to! Please, I'm so begging you  let me rock!"
"SOPHIE: Why Wednesdays and Fridays?"
"LANE: Because that's when my mom has her Bible group."
"SOPHIE: Okay, let's see what you got."
"LANE: Really? Oh my God, thank you! [sits down at the drum set] Can I hit them this time?"
"SOPHIE: Go ahead."
"LANE: Yes! A one, two, three, four! [starts to play]"
"SOPHIE: I'll be in the back in case the cops come."
"LANE: Oh, hey, do you mind turning off the lights on your way out? My mom sometimes walks home this way."
"[Sophie turns out the lights, and Lane starts playing again]"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory walks down the street and sees Luke in front of the diner]"
"RORY: Hey"
"LUKE: Rory."
"RORY: You're back?"
"LUKE: I'm back."
"RORY: You catch anything?"
"LUKE: Nah. Apparently the fish went fishing also."
"RORY: Too bad."
"LUKE: Yeah, well. So that's the, uh. . ."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LUKE: Does it hurt?"
"RORY: No, not really. Just itches a little."
"LUKE: Yeah, I can imagine. Make sure you don't use a pencil."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"LUKE: Your arm. . . you know, when it itches. I broke my arm once  itching drove me crazy. Grabbed a pencil, shoved it down the cast to scratch, ya know..."
"RORY: Bad results?"
"LUKE: Bad results."
"RORY: Got it. No pencils, I promise."
"LUKE: Good. So, you want some coffee?"
"RORY: Sure."
"[they walk into the diner]"
"LUKE: Where's your mom tonight?"
"RORY: At a party for my Grandpa."
"LUKE: Oh, sounds nice. Grab yourself a donut."
"RORY: So, have you heard from him?"
"LUKE: Oh, no. I talked to his mom, though. He got home okay."
"RORY: Good, that's good."
"LUKE: Yeah, good."
"RORY: What about his stuff?"
"LUKE: Oh, I'm gonna send it."
"RORY: Right, makes sense. Luke?"
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"RORY: It wasn't his fault."
"LUKE: I know it wasn't."

"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: Where is this place?"
"LORELAI: It's not too far."
"RORY: You've been saying that for miles."
"LORELAI: It has not been miles."
"RORY: My feet are sore."
"LORELAI: Hey, Tonto, when did you become older than me?"
"RORY: Just tell me what this new breakfast place is and then I'll be quiet."
"LORELAI: It's an amazing new mystery place that I found and that's all I'm telling ya."
"RORY: Just tell me if it's in this town or the next."
"LORELAI: We don't patronize the next town."
"RORY: Since when?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, didn't they feed lead to our jumping frog or something?"
"RORY: Oh yeah, right after they stoned the woman who won the lottery."
"LORELAI: See, so the boycott's legit."
"LANE: [runs up behind them] Hey, wait, stop!"
"LORELAI: Oh look, it's Michael Landon."
"LANE: Oh my God, you guys walk fast. I've been chasing you for the past two blocks."
"RORY: Hey, we were being followed."
"LORELAI: I told you I wasn't just being paranoid. Maybe next time you'll take me seriously when I tell you furniture moved itself."
"LANE: Where are you guys going?"
"RORY: Mystery breakfast."
"LANE: Out of town?"
"LORELAI: Does no one remember the definition of the word mystery?"
"LANE: Sorry, I was just wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again this morning?"
"LORELAI: It's not like they have any other use."
"LANE: Thanks. I've almost nailed the fill in the Ramble On. I just have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull my arms back."
"RORY: John Bonham had that same problem."
"LORELAI: Key's in the turtle."
"LANE: Enjoy your mystery breakfast. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Come on, it's not much farther."
"RORY: We're not heading toward any businesses of any kind. [Lorelai stops walking] What?"
"LORELAI: We have arrived."
"RORY: Arrived where? [looks up] Aw, you are without shame."
"CUT TO INSIDE SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the table as Sookie serves them breakfast]"
"RORY: Sookie, you do not have to do this."
"SOOKIE: What do you mean? Feeding my girls, making them happy, I love doing this."
"LORELAI: Yeah, so feel the love and pass the salt."
"RORY: It makes me feel guilty."
"LORELAI: Eating can help drown that."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah, eat, eat. I'm gonna eat."
"RORY: Gee, can the help sit at the table too?"
"LORELAI: As long as they don't sing folk songs or tell bawdy stories. Hey, what's with Narcoleptic Nate over there?"
"[Jackson, who is leaning against the counter with his eyes closed, moans]"
"SOOKIE: He's not much of a morning person."
"[Jackson moans]"
"LORELAI: Now say, I can't believe I ate the whole thing.'"
"SOOKIE: It takes him about an hour to become Jackson."
"[Jackson moans]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, hey, I had a good idea for the wedding."
"SOOKIE: Cool."
"LORELAI: Instead of those little wrapped things with Jordan Almonds at every place setting, what if we wrap up a few aspirin?"
"SOOKIE: Aspirin?"
"LORELAI: For the morning after hangovers."
"SOOKIE: That's funny."
"LORELAI: Cause Jordan Almonds are so done. Huh, Jackson what do you think  aspirin over almonds?"
"[Jackson moans.]"
"LORELAI: Can we take that as a yes?"
"SOOKIE: No. See, everything eventually registers. He'll chime in on this in a couple of days."
"RORY: Days?"
"SOOKIE: Days."
"LORELAI: Hey, is Jackson in the house? Let me here you say unh."
"JACKSON: Unh."
"LORELAI: A new toy."
"RORY: Shameless."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is studying at the kitchen table as Rory walks out of her bedroom]"
"RORY: How's it going?"
"LORELAI: I hate these books, hate them."
"RORY: Now now."
"LORELAI: Agh! See that? They're trying to escape  they hate me, too."
"RORY: Your books don't hate you."
"LORELAI: Ugh, Rory, my brain is full. It has reached capacity. It's Shea Stadium when the b*at played. It's cramped and girls are screaming and I think"
"George is fighting with Ringo."
"RORY: You have a very active head."
"LORELAI: I simply cannot ingest anymore information."
"RORY: So take a break."
"LORELAI: I don't have time."
"RORY: Close your eyes, clear your head."
"LORELAI: No, because clearing my head just means that all the knowledge I have painstakingly stuffed in there will leak out. In order to make room for stuff, I lose stuff. It's a very vicious circle."
"RORY: I'll make some coffee."
"LORELAI: I hate finals."
"RORY: Nobody likes finals."
"LORELAI: Thank God I'm graduating and this is the last time I have to cram like this because my pursuit of higher education has led me to a very interesting discovery about myself. Do you wanna hear it?"
"RORY: Sure."
"LORELAI: I despise academics. Yup, learning, knowledge, it's all worthless. I have no idea in what you see in any of it."
"RORY: Learning is fun, plus for me there's that whole ""I'm a minor so it's mandatory"" thing."
"LORELAI: That's what k*ll me  this is self-inflicted. I'm a masochist. I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it."
"RORY: That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile, trust me."
"LORELAI: I guess, unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people."
"RORY: Hey, you're graduating."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: No, you're graduating  there is gonna be a ceremony."
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. It's community college."
"RORY: Well, community colleges have ceremonies."
"LORELAI: My community college doesn't even have a lawn, they won't necessarily have a ceremony"
"RORY: They must. Did you ask?"
"LORELAI: No. Well, now that you mention it, I think someone said something about some cheesy ceremony for my business class."
"RORY: When is it?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. . .next Thursday or something."
"RORY: That's great, you have to do it."
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: You have to do it."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: Yes. You've never been apart of an actual graduation ceremony."
"LORELAI: I know. That's because my stupid conservative high school wouldn't let me be in the ceremony and nurse you at the same time."
"RORY: Don't be gross."
"LORELAI: Do you really think I should do it?"
"RORY: Yes! You've worked hard for this, you've earned it."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"RORY: Come on, you know that deep down you really want to do this."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll admit, I've always wanted to wear one of those gowns."
"RORY: And the hat?"
"LORELAI: For the tassel cause you know my thing for fringe."
"RORY: And they call out your name and people clap and you get your diploma."
"LORELAI: Oh, and then you do that thing where you move the tassel from one side to the other  very symbolic, very dramatic."
"RORY: That's it, you're doing it."
"LORELAI: All right, if you insist."
"RORY: Okay, who do you wanna invite?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, you."
"RORY: And?"
"LORELAI: That's cool with me."
"RORY: Sookie and Jackson?"
"LORELAI: Aw, that'll be fun."
"RORY: Okay. And Grandma and Grandpa?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no. No no no."
"RORY: Come on, it's your graduation. They should be there."
"LORELAI: Forget it."
"RORY: But --"
"LORELAI: They won't want to be there."
"RORY: Of course they will."
"LORELAI: Rory, I was supposed to graduate from high school. Go to Vassar. Marry a Yale man and get myself a proper nickname like Babe or Bunny or Shih Tzu."
"RORY: Yes but --"
"LORELAI: Instead, I got pregnant. I didn't finish high school, I didn't marry your father and I ended up in a career that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her."
"RORY: That's not - ."
"LORELAI: I humiliated them. The two proudest people in the world and I humiliated them. I spoiled their plans. I took their fine upbringing in a world of comfort and opportunity and I threw it in their faces. I broke their hearts and they'll never forgive me. I guess I can't expect them to."
"RORY: Maybe you're wrong about how they feel about all this. It was a long time ago."
"LORELAI: Rory, I don't want them to go. It'll just hurt them. . .and me, okay?"
"RORY: Okay. You should get back to your studying."
"LORELAI: Fine. Oh, great."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I think I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours."
"RORY: No, you haven't."
"LORELAI: Yes, I have. In fact, I may have forgotten everything that I've ever known. Child, what be your name?"
"RORY: Study."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Dean are walking through the center of town]"
"LORELAI: Just explain the concept one more time."
"DEAN: And be mocked again? No, thank you."
"RORY: Come on."
"LORELAI: Yeah, maybe we're missing something."
"DEAN: Okay, you go to a special sh**ting range "
"RORY: A skeet sh**ting range."
"DEAN: Right. There's two of you and the guy with the g*n yells ""Pull!"" and then the other guy releases a clay pigeon from a machine into the air and so you try to sh**t it."
"LORELAI: No, I don't think we're missing anything."
"DEAN: Yeah, I knew it."
"RORY: You sh**t pigeons?"
"DEAN: Clay pigeons."
"LORELAI: When you hit them, does blood come out?"
"DEAN: They're clay."
"RORY: And why do you like to do this?"
"DEAN: I don't know. My dad sh*t skeet when he was my age and so he wants to pass the tradition down."
"LORELAI: What if you accidentally hit a real pigeon?"
"RORY: Yeah, does that count?"
"DEAN: That's never happened."
"LORELAI: What if a clay pigeon hits a real pigeon, does that count?"
"RORY: Yeah, does that count?"
"DEAN: I've only done this once."
"LORELAI: Hey, if you get really good, do you move on to other animals like clay chickens and clay sheep?"
"DEAN: You know, we didn't go skeet sh**ting, I just made it all up."
"LORELAI: [stops in front of the market] Oh, hey, I gotta go in here."
"RORY: Oh, what do you need?"
"LORELAI: Just general stuff. You guys go and be in love."
"RORY: I'll see you back at the house."
"DEAN: Bye."
"RORY: What if you sh**t the person who throws the pigeon up in the air? Would that count?"
"CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Lorelai is shopping and runs into Luke.]"
"LUKE: Oh."
"LORELAI: Dah."
"LUKE: Sorry."
"LORELAI: No, no, I should have signaled or honked or something, my fault."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Well, um, I guess it was inevitable us running into each other. It's a very tiny community."
"LUKE: Guess so."
"LORELAI: How's the diner?"
"LUKE: It's still there."
"LORELAI: Yes, I knew that. I'm able to empirically with my eyes, uh. . .Hey Luke, do you think we could "
"LUKE: I gotta get back."
"LORELAI: Okay, right, right."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: I'll get it."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: Hello Rory."
"RORY: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice."
"EMILY: I'm thrilled to see you on no notice. So, tell me, what's this about? You were so mysterious on the phone."
"RORY: I just wanted to talk to you about something in person."
"EMILY: Well, come in, come in."
"[Emily leads Rory to a lavishly set table.]"
"RORY: Wow."
"EMILY: It's an English tea service. One the advantages of our having an English maid. That, and the fact that she speaks English."
"RORY: You didn't have to do this."
"EMILY: But it's tea time and I wanted to. . .oh no! b*at, I told you to doily line the plates!"
"RORY: You don't have to doily line the plates."
"RICHARD: [calls from another room] Hello?"
"EMILY: We're in the dining room."
"RICHARD: Oh, oh, Rory, you're already here."
"RORY: You're out of breath."
"RICHARD: I ran over from the office."
"RORY: Oh, you didn't have to run."
"RICHARD: Well, your grandmother said you had something to discuss with us. That certainly justifies a run."
"EMILY: All right, everybody, sit, sit. Pour the tea, b*at."
"RORY: Um, actually, b*at, could you hold off on pouring the tea for just a minute? Thank you very much. Grandma, Grandpa, I would like to propose an idea to you. Now, you can go for it or not, it's entirely up to you, but I would like for you to promise me that you will not get upset."
"EMILY: We won't get upset."
"RORY: And that you will try to keep an open mind."
"EMILY: All right."
"RORY: And that you will let me finish my presentation completely before you respond."
"EMILY: [to Richard] She's been hanging around you far too much."
"RICHARD: Rory, we accept your terms. Please proceed."
"RORY: Thank you. First, let me start by saying that Mom doesn't know that I'm here. She'd probably be pretty mad if she knew that I was, but I feel that this is important. As you know, Mom's been going to business school at the community college out here for three years now."
"EMILY: I believe she's mentioned it."
"RORY: Well, she's doing very well and she's finishing up. Actually, she's graduating Thursday, and there's going to be a ceremony and I think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there. It may not seem like it would, but it's true."
"EMILY: Well, if it would mean so much to her then why didn't she invite us herself?"
"RORY: Because she didn't think you'd wanna go. And I get that, but I think it's a mistake. I had a school thing once, and I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go so I didn't invite her. It was my kindergarten ""Salute to Vegetables"" pageant and I was broccoli and I did a tap dance with a guy that was playing beets and the entire number I was just thinking, ""Mom's not here"" and it was my fault that she wasn't there and, well, it was kind of a life lesson for me. Now, if the thought of going to Mom's graduation upsets you or makes you unhappy or uncomfortable in any way, then, please, don't go because this is an important night for Mom and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances. [pulls an envelope out of her backpack] Those are the tickets. It's Thursday, 7pm. It's indoors so weather's not an issue. You can use them or not, no hard feelings, do what you feel is best. And if you don't mind, I would really appreciate it if you would keep this conversation between the three of us. That's all I have to say, thanks very much for your patience. Now, I believe I have time for a scone before my bus leaves."
"EMILY: b*at, the tea, please."
"RORY: Emily, these look delicious. So, Richard, how was your day today?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the coffee table with a drink as Rory reads on the sofa]"
"LORELAI: I am feeling so good, sista, because it's over! No more finals, no more studying, no more school, the pressure's off. Do you know how much pressure I felt, do you? All last week I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest."
"RORY: A giant man?"
"LORELAI: And his giant brother."
"RORY: Did they have names?"
"LORELAI: Clem and Clem. Huh, same names, which did not reflect well on the imagination of their mothers."
"RORY: Mother."
"LORELAI: Mothers. There were two Clems."
"RORY: Yeah, cause they were brothers."
"LORELAI: Yes, so they had mothers."
"RORY: Okay, you're drawing me into your drunken world."
"LORELAI: It's not a bad place to be, my friend. Mnh-mnh, t*nk's empty. [walks into the kitchen to get another drink]"
"RORY: Hey, what is this?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: This, uh, Life Plan' book thing."
"LORELAI: A little gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College. Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?"
"RORY: Um, if you can't remember where the living room is."
"LORELAI: Ha ha, I'm still good. [walks back into living room]"
"RORY: Okay, here's an interesting question for you  ""Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?"""
"LORELAI: Oh, well, uh, they're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure. I mean, I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock 'em out and, uh, have Nanny catch 'em and care for 'em, make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come anywhere near them and then just return them to me when they're twenty-one."
"RORY: Well, what about me?"
"LORELAI: You are my favorite eldest child, you get to stay by my side."
"RORY: Oh, I feel so privileged."
"[Phone rings]"
"RORY: I'll get it."
"LORELAI: Hey, now, if that's Mick Jagger, hang up and blow that whistle I gave you."
"RORY: [answers phone] Hello?"
"JESS: Hi. [pause] Hello?"
"RORY: Hi."
"JESS: Is this a bad time?"
"RORY: Um, no, just hold on a sec? [to Lorelai] Um, the music. . . uh, I'll be right back. [Rory takes the phone to her room and closes the door.] Hi."
"JESS: You said that already."
"RORY: I did. You're right, sorry."
"JESS: So, what's up?"
"RORY: Nothing. What about you?"
"JESS: Same."
"RORY: So, what have you been doing?"
"JESS: Nothin' much. Just hanging out. . . in the park, mostly."
"RORY: Central Park?"
"JESS: Washington Square Park."
"RORY: Oh."
"JESS: It's cooler."
"RORY: Yes."
"JESS: It's where David Lee Roth got busted."
"RORY: Right, right. I hope he's got it together now."
"JESS: Sounds like you got a party going on there."
"RORY: No, it's just me and my mom."
"JESS: Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna go. This is long distance."
"RORY: Yeah, it is long distance."
"JESS: So, see ya."
"RORY: Yeah, see ya."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[On Thursday morning, Rory is getting ready for school in the living room as Lorelai runs around upstairs.]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Ahh!"
"RORY: What's wrong?"
"LORELAI: I'm experiencing frustration."
"RORY: At the general state of things in the world or at something particular?"
"LORELAI: What do you wear to a graduation?"
"RORY: Cap and gown."
"LORELAI: Duh, I mean underneath."
"RORY: Whatever you want. The gown will cover it."
"LORELAI: It's more complicated than that. I don't want to overdress so that I'm sweating if it's hot in the auditorium but if I don't have enough on and it's cold, then I'll freeze."
"RORY: It is complicated, especially if you overthink it."
"LORELAI: And now I need a helpful comment."
"RORY: Take light layers. Wear your turquoise and tan dress that you just got that's cool and it'll look good without your gown on, and wear your turquoise vintagey sweater over it because it'll look great with the dress and it'll keep you warm if it's cold in the auditorium."
"LORELAI: You are a fashion genius."
"RORY: Well, you've taught me everything I know."
"LORELAI: My brain's not working today."
"RORY: You're excited, it's a big day."
"LORELAI: What time are you getting there?"
"RORY: I have a bunch of newspaper stuff after school, but no later than six."
"LORELAI: And then we'll go out to eat after?"
"RORY: Any place you want, and it's on me."
"LORELAI: You don't have to do that."
"RORY: You're the graduate. You get to be pampered."
"LORELAI: Okay, then I would like to go to Chateau Jean Georges la Jean Georges in Paris."
"RORY: I'll look it up in Zagats and book the Concorde. I gotta go."
"LORELAI: Okay, I gotta get ready."
"RORY: Wait, wait, I wanna see my little graduate one more time before the big event."
"LORELAI: What do you think  do I look ready to make my way in the world?"
"RORY: Yes, and if all else fails, you can marry rich."
"LORELAI: I love that we always have that option."
"RORY: Hey, what are you gonna do with your hair?"
"LORELAI: I got the curling iron warming up."
"RORY: Mom, the cap! You put it on, its gonna --"
"BOTH: - smush the curls down."
"LORELAI: You are a genius."
"RORY: See you tonight"
"LORELAI: Hey, try to seat us next to a celebrity on the Concorde, like Sting or Screech or someone."
"RORY: I'll try."
"CUT TO FRONT OF CHILTON"
"[Rory is walking with Paris]"
"PARIS: So I told her, ""Look missy--"""
"RORY: You called your advisor ""Missy""?"
"PARIS: It was attitudinal. I said I'm not taking AP calculus from Henemen. I'm going with Branch. Branch is a graduate of MIT and Henemen went to Berkley. Berkley! I mean, he may have majored in math but what did he minor in? Bean sprouts? Forget it. And I'm telling my advisor all this, Mrs. Schlosser, and I looked down in her trash can and there's this half-eaten banana in there. Nothing else. And I pictured her sitting in the shoe box of an office eating a banana all by herself and I almost felt sorry for her, but then she questioned my judgment about Berkley so I eviscerated her. I mean, she was welling up at the end, but she had the decency to hold it in until I was gone. I have enough faculty recommendations to run for student council, so I don't need her anyway. My locker's this way."
"[As Paris walks toward the building, Rory turns and goes back out the gates.]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie carries a cake into the room as Lorelai sits at the counter with her eyes closed]"
"SOOKIE: Are they closed?"
"LORELAI: They're closed."
"SOOKIE: Are you sure?"
"LORELAI: I'm sure."
"SOOKIE: Okay, one second and open, open, open."
"LORELAI: Aw, you made me a tassel hat cake!"
"SOOKIE: Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans."
"LORELAI: You're evil."
"SOOKIE: And you're graduating."
"LORELAI: Yes I am, aren't I?"
"SOOKIE: Here. Oh, hey, I brought those pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation."
"LORELAI: Hand them over, lady."
"SOOKIE: Okay, but don't laugh."
"LORELAI: I promise."
"SOOKIE: I was younger then, not as refined."
"LORELAI: Ha, and you're stoned."
"SOOKIE: Totally."
"LORELAI: I thought you hated that."
"SOOKIE: It was peer pressure. At my school, if Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off."
"LORELAI: Well, I think Gilbert had a snappy slogan."
"SOOKIE: Oh, I was nauseous all day."
"LORELAI: Your parents?"
"SOOKIE: For the traditional parents-flanking-their-graduate sh*t. Don't they look proud?"
"LORELAI: They do, very proud."
"[Michel walks into the kitchen]"
"MICHEL: What is that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it's pictures of Sookie's high school graduation. What was your high school graduation like, Michel?"
"MICHEL: It was dignified, as most French ceremonies are. Poetry was read, a string quartet played, a ballerina performed."
"LORELAI: You drank some Boone's Farm out of a boda bag and knocked a beach ball around?"
"MICHEL: I don't understand half of what you said."
"LORELAI: That's why we work."
"[Cell phone rings.]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, Lor, how you doing?"
"LORELAI: Christopher. I'm good, I'm excited."
"CHRISTOPHER: You should be, it's a big day. Did you get my present?"
"LORELAI: What present?"
"CHRISTOPHER: A basket. You should've gotten it by now."
"LORELAI: Hey, did a basket come for me?"
"MICHEL: Mm, it came, it was heavy, I felt a twinge so I dropped it for health reasons. It's probably still intact."
"LORELAI: My crack staff has just informed me of its arrival. I'm going to find it. [walks into the lobby and sees the basket on a table] Wow!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I put it together myself."
"LORELAI: And it's all for me?"
"CHRISTOPHER: All for you."
"LORELAI: Chris. . wow. [starts looking through the basket] Ha! A twenty-five dollar savings bond."
"CHRISTOPHER: That's a long-term investment. Don't touch it for thirty years, you're looking at forty-five dollars."
"LORELAI: Ooh, a youth hostel card."
"CHRISTOPHER: For the young girl who doesn't mind sharing a bathroom with fifty strangers."
"LORELAI: ""What Color Is Your Parachute? A Practical Manual for Job Hunters."""
"CHRISTOPHER: Helping you answer the two questions: what do you want to do and where do you want to do it?"
"LORELAI: A DVD of The Graduate, gotta have that. Ooh, The Portable Nietzsche."
"CHRISTOPHER: Light, cheery reading."
"LORELAI: An application to join the Armed Forces."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, if your dreams don't pan out and Nietzsche's no help, it's a viable option."
"LORELAI: And something in a nice little velvet box. Ooh, a necklace, and the pearl almost looks real."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, it better look very real, because it is."
"LORELAI: That's not funny."
"CHRISTOPHER: This is not a funny gift."
"LORELAI: Christopher, this is extremely not funny. This is totally humorless. It's. . .it's beautiful."
"CHRISTOPHER: I think you're awesome, Lor. With everything you do and raising Rory the way you did, you're superwoman."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"CHRISTOPHER: Have a great day. I wish I could be there. Take lots of pictures for me."
"LORELAI: Ugh, the camera, I forgot the camera."
"CHRISTOPHER: Look in the basket."
"LORELAI: [pulls out a disposable camera] Oh, you thought of everything."
"CHRISTOPHER: Have a great night."
"LORELAI: Thanks, you too. Bye."
"CUT TO BUS STATION"
"[Rory gets off the bus and looks around. She walks out of the station and onto the crowded sidewalk.]"
"RORY: Could you. . .um, excuse me, sir, do you know. . . do you know where Washington. . .excuse me, ma'am. . .Washington Square Park?"
"WOMAN: End of Fifth."
"RORY: Thank you! [to someone else] Excuse me, where's Fifth?"
"CUT TO WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK"
"[Jess is reading on a bench as Rory walks up behind him]"
"RORY: Hi."
"JESS: How ya doing?"
"RORY: Good, how about you?"
"JESS: Good. You hungry?"
"RORY: Starved."
"JESS: I know a place."
"[They walk off together.]"
"CUT TO NEW YORK STREET"
"[Jess and Rory are walking down the street]"
"RORY: I feel very urban today."
"JESS: Oh yeah, the plaid just screams urban."
"RORY: I think I look like a native."
"JESS: How well do you know Manhattan?"
"RORY: I've been here a few times. We saw The Bangles here."
"JESS: When was that, twenty years ago?"
"RORY: It was a reunion and they were great."
"JESS: Yeah, they're okay."
"RORY: And a couple years ago Mom drove us in to shop, and she couldn't find a good parking place and all of the parking lots were a total rip-off, so she kept making U-turns and cutting off taxis and we were being screamed at in so many different languages that we just turned around and drove home and bought a Hummel at the curio store in Stars Hollow."
"JESS: How very adventurous."
"RORY: I'm just saying I'm no stranger to the Big Apple."
"JESS: You are if you're calling it the Big Apple."
"RORY: So I don't have the lingo down yet, but at least I have the attitude."
"JESS: You do, huh?"
"RORY: Oh yeah. When I was getting a locker for my backpack at the bus stop, there was this guy and he was just standing there staring at me and instead of ignoring him I just fixed him with a really withering stare."
"JESS: That I've got to see."
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Oh, come on, let me see your withering stare."
"RORY: It's dangerous. I could hurt you."
"JESS: I've been hurt before."
"RORY: No."
"JESS: I'm disappointed. So your arm's okay?"
"RORY: Yeah, it looks worse than it is."
"JESS: [Looks at Rory's cast.] I like this Emily chick. Friend of yours?"
"RORY: She's a friend to all of us dispossessed."
"JESS: So here's our lunch place."
"RORY: A hot dog stand?"
"JESS: Hey, I eat here everyday. It's nothing fancy, but -"
"RORY: No, I love it. It's perfect."
"JESS: Good. [to hot dog vendor] One with everything on it."
"RORY: Make that two, please."
"JESS: So, uh. . .how's -"
"RORY: Luke?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: Okay. He went fishing."
"JESS: Fishing?"
"RORY: Yeah. He didn't catch anything though."
"JESS: Probably used the wrong bait."
"RORY: Yeah, that's a common fishing blunder."
"JESS: So he's good?"
"RORY: Yeah, he's good. I can tell him hello for you if you want."
"JESS: Whatever."
"RORY: [to hot dog vendor] Thank you. [takes a bite] Oh, my God, this is really good!"
"JESS: I'm glad you like it. So how much time you got?"
"RORY: I got a bit."
"JESS: There's a record store you should check out. It's run by this insane freak who's like a walking encyclopedia for every punk and garage-band record ever made. Catalog numbers. . .it's crazy. The place is right out of High Fidelity."
"RORY: Let's go."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Where you going?"
"JESS: Subway."
"RORY: I thought we were gonna walk."
"JESS: It's fifteen blocks. Come on, I think you'll like it."
"RORY: Do they allow hot dogs in the subway?"
"JESS: You are so an out-of-towner."

"CUT TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE"
"[Lorelai walks into the auditorium, then follows a sign to the graduate check-in room.]"
"LORELAI: Excuse me, hi, I'm one of the graduates."
"MAN: Wow, you're hours early."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, I just wanted to b*at traffic and have time to get ready and relax, and also, I've heard the early bird gets the unwrinkled gowns without the mysterious stains in them."
"MAN: This is true. Take your pick."
"LORELAI: Thank you. This is so exciting. Isn't this exciting?"
"MAN: This is my eighth year of doing this."
"LORELAI: So, not so exciting for you, got it."
"[As Lorelai looks through a rack of gowns, Emily walks by the open door. Lorelai catches a glimpse of her]"
"LORELAI: Huh."
"[Lorelai thinks for a moment, then goes into the auditorium to see if it was really Emily]"
"EMILY: [to cameraman] You're being so cryptic. Do you need a power source or not?"
"RAUL: Look, my batteries are all fully charged. It just depends on how fast they deplete."
"EMILY: So, we need one just in case?"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai, it's hours before the ceremony. What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Um, I'm just getting. . .I'm sorry, what are you doing here? How do you even know about this?"
"EMILY: I shouldn't know about this? A mother can't know about this?"
"LORELAI: No, I just mean -"
"EMILY: You're graduating."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: So, we're here to see you graduate. This is Raul."
"LORELAI: Hey. So, you and Raul are just here to see me graduate?"
"EMILY: Don't be silly. Your father will be joining me later."
"LORELAI: My father?"
"EMILY: Yes, remember him? Tall, bow tie."
"LORELAI: I remember Dad, Mom. I just. . .ah, Rory told you."
"EMILY: Yes. That's okay, isn't it? It's a little late if it's not."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, it's perfectly fine that you're here, absolutely. I'm just surprised. [to Raul] Who are you?"
"RAUL: I'm Raul."
"EMILY: I just told you that."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, did Rory invite Raul, too?"
"EMILY: Raul is my cameraman."
"LORELAI: Cameraman?"
"EMILY: He's going to be filming the ceremony for us. He's very talented. He screened an independent film of his as an audition, ""Welcome to Scab Land."""
"It was disgusting, but beautifully photographed."
"RAUL: It was supposed to be disgusting."
"LORELAI: I'm sure it was. Mom, all this stuff. . ."
"MAN: Excuse me, all of this equipment, it can't be here."
"EMILY: Well, obviously we're not going to leave all of this equipment here for everybody to trip over. We're not cretins."
"LORELAI: She's handling it. Right, Mom? You're handling it."
"RAUL: Okay, this lighting sucks!"
"EMILY: Can we do something about the lighting?"
"MAN: I don't think so, ma'am. I don't know."
"EMILY: [to Raul] It's a community college, we'll just have to cope. Think documentary."
"LORELAI: Mom, please. People will be showing up here soon. You can't --"
"EMILY: Lorelai, I am perfectly capable of handling this. No one will be inconvenienced."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm just gonna let everyone deal with all this because I need to relax and get a cup of coffee and maybe hammer a nail into my head."
"EMILY: You're not needed here, Lorelai. Go get your coffee, relax. You're going to redo your makeup later, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: Maybe an Irish coffee."
"CUT TO NEW YORK RECORD STORE"
"[Rory and Jess are looking through the records]"
"JESS: I haven't even heard of half these bands."
"RORY: I love that about this place. God, Lane would wanna live here."
"JESS: Who's Slim?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"OWNER: Grunge band out of Kentucky. Two albums, plus a double-A side single, disbanded in '94."
"JESS: Thanks."
"RORY: [looks through the records] Oh my God!"
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: Look! [shows him a record]"
"JESS: Go-go's. You must have that one."
"RORY: No, for my mom. This was her favorite group when she was my age, and it's signed by Belinda. This would be the perfect graduation present. I've been looking for something all week long, and I couldn't find anything and now I have Belinda."
"JESS: Graduation?"
"RORY: Oh, from college, from business classes."
"JESS: I'm surprised she has time for anything except lighting darts on fire and throwing them at my picture."
"RORY: Well, it's not a lot of time, but . . ."
"JESS: Uh-huh. Go on, get it. She'll like it."
"RORY: Thank you so much for bringing me here. This was fate."
"JESS: Yes, it was."
"RORY: And in return, I just might show you my withering stare."
"JESS: I'm a lucky man."
"CUT TO BUS STATION"
"[Rory and Jess are walking toward her bus]"
"RORY: I think this one's mine."
"JESS: Yup, the sign says Boonesville."
"TOURIST: Excuse me, I'm so sorry to bother you. Which way is 44th?"
"RORY: Oh, um, that way."
"TOURIST: Great, thanks."
"RORY: I got asked directions."
"JESS: I saw."
"RORY: He took me for a native. That's so cool."
"JESS: That's very impressive. 44th's the other way."
"RORY: Oh no."
"JESS: Sorry."
"RORY: Oh, man, I should go find him."
"JESS: He'll figure it out when he sees all the numbers getting smaller instead of bigger."
"RORY: He still thought I was a native. That's cool."
"JESS: I'm your witness."
"RORY: Well, I should go."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: I gotta go to my mom's graduation."
"JESS: And give her Belinda."
"RORY: And give her Belinda."
"JESS: Go on. I'll check on the guy, I'll make sure he's not wandering around looking for 44."
"[Rory boards the bus and looks at Jess through the window.]"
"JESS: Why did you come here?"
"[Rory opens the window.]"
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: I said, why did you come here?"
"RORY: Well -"
"JESS: I mean, you ditched school and everything. That's so not you. Why'd you do it?"
"RORY: Because you didn't say goodbye."
"JESS: Oh. Bye, Rory."
"RORY: Bye, Jess."
"CUT TO GRADUATE CHECK-IN ROOM"
"[Lorelai is fixing her makeup near the chalkboard. She sneezes and stirs up a cloud of chalk dust.]"
"LORELAI: Great, I'm Woody Allen in Annie Hall."
"LIZA: You thought ahead. Smart."
"LORELAI: Oh, the mirror? Yeah, I never leave home without all the essentials: mirror, makeup, picture of Shaun Cassidy. I'm done. Do you want to use it?"
"LIZA: Thanks. Oh, don't I look charming?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you look great."
"LIZA: I've looked better. I had to run here straight from work -- Kinko's."
"ZACH: Hey, Liza, that gets me thinking  maybe you and I oughta do a little reproducing after the ceremony."
"LIZA: Clever."
"ZACH: Don't be a snot."
"LIZA: Shut up! [to Lorelai] That's my boyfriend, Zach."
"LORELAI: Oh, sure."
"LIZA: Of course, we're breaking up 'cause we're transferring to different schools. He's going to Florida State, I'm going to UMass. . .although I'm kinda going to miss this place."
"ZACH: I'm not. This place stunk. It's Bush League."
"LORELAI: Why'd you go here?"
"ZACH: My parents, wise investors that they are, couldn't afford anything else."
"LIZA: Yeah, I guess that two-point-zilch grade point average didn't reason into things."
"ZACH: Shut up."
"LIZA: Between the lines."
"ZACH: Go die."
"LORELAI: Are you sure you two don't wanna give it another go, 'cause you're darling together."
"LIZA: Thanks for the mirror."
"LORELAI: My pleasure."
"LIZA: Hey, a bunch of us are going to Shakey's afterwards for a pizza. You wanna come?"
"LORELAI: Aw, I'm going out with my daughter after, but it sounds like fun."
"ZACH: Okay, you guys are not going to believe this. There's some blue-blooded rich woman out there setting up professional film equipment like she's sh**ting a movie or something."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"LIZA: Whose mother is it?"
"ZACH: I don't know. Little Precious must be around here somewhere though."
"LIZA: I hate people with money."
"ZACH: So do I, with every fiber of my being."
"LORELAI: Me too. Money people, ugh."
"CUT TO BUS"
"[Rory's bus is still at the station. She walks up to the bus driver.]"
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"DRIVER: Yes?"
"RORY: Are we leaving soon?"
"DRIVER: I have no idea."
"RORY: Well, should you have an idea?"
"DRIVER: There was an accident, closed the interstate. All outbound buses were told to stand down."
"RORY: Oh. And you don't know when we're going to be allowed to stand up again?"
"DRIVER: Soon, I hope. I hate missing dinner."
"RORY: Yeah. . .me, too."
"CUT TO GRADUATE CHECK-IN ROOM"
"[Sookie and Jackson walk over to Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: There's our little graduate. Oh, my God, look at that gown. You look just like the Statue of Liberty."
"LORELAI: Ah, all big and stony?"
"SOOKIE: No, you look amazing."
"LORELAI: Hmm. You look very G.Q."
"JACKSON: Oh, thanks to my best new friend Ermenegildo Zegna."
"SOOKIE: Don't you love how he can pronounce it and all?"
"LORELAI: Very Cosmopolitan."
"SOOKIE: He got it for the rehearsal dinner. It's his first real suit."
"JACKSON: And not my last. I look hot!"
"LORELAI: Mmm."
"SOOKIE: So, you know that Emily's out there, right?"
"LORELAI: Oh, shh!"
"SOOKIE: Why shh?"
"LORELAI: It's a long story. Just do me a favor?"
"SOOKIE: Sure."
"LORELAI: Keep an eye on my parents, make sure they don't disrupt anything, my mother doesn't behead anyone, my father doesn't snore too loudly when he falls asleep."
"SOOKIE: They're not gonna do anything like that."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, have you not met them?"
"SOOKIE: Why would they come and do that?"
"LORELAI: They're here because Rory invited them."
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: Yes! They can't say no to that little face. It's like hitting a puppy with a rolled-up newspaper."
"ZACH: Hey, you guys are not gonna believe this."
"LIZA: You're Mr. Announcement Guy today."
"ZACH: What, are you going to pipe in every time I talk?"
"LIZA: Can it!"
"ZACH: Stuff it!"
"LORELAI: They're in love."
"SOOKIE: Clearly."
"ZACH: So, Mrs. Got Bucks out there not only has a cameraman, she's got a sound guy, too."
"LORELAI: [quietly] Oh, no."
"ZACH: It's like a Baz Luhrmann movie out there."
"SOOKIE: [quietly] That's Emily, right?"
"LORELAI: Shh!"
"LIZA: Rich people feel so entitled."
"LORELAI: Yeah, damn them!"
"ZACH: I swear, I saw her wipe her face with a hundred dollar bill."
"LORELAI: We should line them up against a wall, you know what I'm saying?"
"WOMAN: Is Lorelai Gilmore here?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"WOMAN: Oh, good. Have a look at these, will you? [shows her a box of corsages]"
"LORELAI: Wow!"
"SOOKIE: Pretty."
"WOMAN: Look them over and take your pick."
"LORELAI: What for?"
"WOMAN: To wear."
"LORELAI: Are they for sale?"
"WOMAN: No, they're paid for. These are from your mother, Emily Gilmore."
"LIZA: Wow, ritzy."
"LORELAI: I really don't want to wear a corsage."
"WOMAN: They're all paid for."
"LORELAI: Really, it's too much."
"WOMAN: Your mother wants you to pick one."
"LORELAI: Really, it's okay."
"WOMAN: She'll just come back here herself."
"LORELAI: This one, thanks."
"WOMAN: Good choice. The cameraman said that would look best on film."
"ZACH: So you're the rich girl."
"LORELAI: Maybe. I'm not rich but . . .my parents have money, but I'm totally self-sufficient. I take nothing from them, except this corsage. . .and my daughter's tuition. So, you gonna stone me?"
"ZACH: I should have guessed. Look at her friends, they're wearing suits that drip money."
"JACKSON: Hey pal, this was thirty percent off!"
"LIZA: So, that's why you didn't want to get pizza, 'cause it's below you?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no, Liza, pizza is not below me. Believe me, I love pizza. I eat tons of pizza. It's one of my four major food groups: candy, popcorn, and pizza  see? It's two of my food groups, that's how much I love pizza."
"LIZA: I want to believe you."
"ZACH: Enjoy your champagne and caviar at The Ritz, Your Highness."
"LORELAI: I am not rich! Ugh! [Pager beeps] My pager."
"JACKSON: Maybe the suit was a little much."
"SOOKIE: You're a fox, now don't start."
"LORELAI: [reads pager] Oh, no."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Rory's running late."
"SOOKIE: Late from what?"
"LORELAI: It doesn't say. It says she's definitely going to be here but if she's not here by seven, she'll sneak in the back. That's weird."
"SOOKIE: She'll be here, don't worry."
"LORELAI: I hope so."
"SOOKIE: How 'bout we sit in back, keep an eye out for her, and we'll save her a seat?"
"LORELAI: That'd be great. Oh, can you hang onto all my stuff for me? I don't want to leave it in here."
"SOOKIE: Will do."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Bye."
"ZACH: Oh, you don't trust your valuables around us poor kids, huh?"
"LORELAI: Knock it off, Zach!"
"CUT TO BUS"
"[Rory's bus makes a stop and some people get off]"
"SEATMATE: You don't look happy."
"RORY: I'm late."
"SEATMATE: Buses are the worst."
"RORY: Why are we making so many stops? The bus didn't make stops on the way into the city."
"SEATMATE: Oh, that was probably an express. This is a local  makes a lot of stops."
"RORY: I should have checked the schedule. I should have checked traffic. Note to self: impulsive definitely does not work for me. [notices seatmate holding a soda can to his lips] What are you doing?"
"SEATMATE: Hmm? Oh, uh, it's for my spit."
"RORY: Your what?"
"SEATMATE: From my smokeless."
"CUT TO GRADUATION CEREMONY"
"[A speaker on stage is calling the graduates up]"
"SPEAKER: Victor David Fuller. . . Nancy Brenda Gatson. . ."
"[Zach sees Lorelai looking around the room.]"
"ZACH: Making sure the camera's getting your best side, princess?"
"RICHARD: [whispers to Emily] Are you telling me that that is the best commencement speaker they could scrounge up?"
"EMILY: I hope Raul's getting enough shots of Lorelai. I don't want the whole damn ceremony and none of her."
"RICHARD: Oh, no, I disagree. I hope he gets every inspired word articulated by the East Coast Marketing Director of Pup n' Taco."
"EMILY: Raul!"
"[As Emily points to the stage, Raul and the sound guy rush down the aisle.]"
"SPEAKER: Joanne Garver..."
"[Raul shoves the camera in Lorelai's face.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, geez. Oh, we're, oh, we're going. . ."
"SPEAKER: John Lawrence Gilfer. . . Lorelai Victoria Gilmore. . . Gretchen Greeman. . ."
"[Emily and Richard look on proudly as Lorelai accepts her diploma and moves her tassel to the other side of her cap.]"
"CUT TO AUDITORIUM"
"[After the ceremony, Lorelai walks up to Emily and Richard]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Mom, Dad."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, I did it."
"RICHARD: Yes."
"EMILY: Raul thinks he got some good footage."
"RICHARD: I should hope so. He certainly cost enough."
"LORELAI: I'm sure it'll be great."
"EMILY: Congratulations, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Thank you. I'm glad you guys came."
"EMILY: Yes, well, we should get going. I guess we'll see you tomorrow for dinner. [they start to leave]"
"LORELAI: Hey, wait. Aren't we going to take a picture?"
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: The three of us, me in the middle with the gown, you know  the traditional pose."
"RICHARD: Well, uh, we don't have a camera with us."
"LORELAI: Hold on. [pulls the disposable camera out of her pocket]"
"EMILY: That's a camera?"
"LORELAI: That's a camera."
"RICHARD: That looks like a toy."
"LORELAI: Um, Raul, would you mind? [they pose together] So. . ."
"RAUL: Okay, on the count of one, two, three, cheese! [takes picture]"
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"EMILY: Yes, well, tomorrow then."
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"EMILY: Let's go, Richard."
"RICHARD: I'll be right there, Emily. [hands Lorelai an envelope] Congratulations."
"LORELAI: Oh, you don't have to do this."
"RICHARD: Put it towards something fun."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Daddy."
"[Emily and Richard leave as Sookie and Jackson walk over]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, we're so proud of you!"
"JACKSON: Yeah, you were great up there."
"LORELAI: Thanks, you guys. Where's Rory? No Rory?"
"SOOKIE: She called your cell and I answered and she said she got hung up on something or other and she'll see you at home."
"LORELAI: Hung up? Hung up where? Is she okay?"
"SOOKIE: She said she's fine. She's sorry, but fine."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, as long as she's okay, I guess. Um, well, I should probably get the gown back. Thanks for coming, Sook, Marcus Schenkenberg."
"SOOKIE: You wanna go out to eat? Celebrate a little?"
"LORELAI: No, I think I'll just go home to Rory."
"SOOKIE: I thought so. See you tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"JACKSON: Wait a minute. . .aspirins instead of Jordan Almonds? But we already bought the almonds."
"SOOKIE: Wow. Now that's the longest anything's ever taken."
"JACKSON: My family's not gonna get the joke. Can't we just use the almonds?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, sweetie, calm down."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is waiting out front as Lorelai pulls into the driveway.]"
"RORY: I'm so, so sorry."
"LORELAI: You're okay, right?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Everything's working? Your wrist is okay, nothing new is broken?"
"RORY: I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Anyone you know, like Lane or someone, suddenly get sick today or break an arm themselves or get in a car wreck?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. Then I can get past worry and move onto other things."
"RORY: I know you're hurt."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you bet I'm hurt. Rory, I really wanted you there today, more than anything. You're why I did this stupid thing in the first place."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: It was a once in a lifetime thing. You should've been there. My best friend should've been there. Whatever it was that kept you, you should've gotten out of it, at least this once. Was it school?"
"RORY: It wasn't school."
"LORELAI: Was it Paris?"
"RORY: It wasn't Paris."
"LORELAI: Well, what was it?"
"RORY: It was so stupid."
"LORELAI: Well, Rory, where were you? What happened?"
"RORY: I cut school!"
"LORELAI: You what?"
"RORY: I cut school and I got on a bus and I don't even know why I did it. I. . .I have no excuse. I was just standing outside of Chilton, and I don't know, I must have had a stroke or something. What does a stroke feel like?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Not good, probably."
"RORY: And I left school and I got on a bus and I went to New York. And that's it! I'm grounded for six months, or seven, and no TV, no stereo, no reading. In fact, take all of my books away from me and lock them up."
"LORELAI: Hold on here. You went to New York?"
"RORY: And no magazines, either. And I'm going to do all of the housework. Laundry, dishes. . . in fact, we're going to start eating at home so that we have dishes."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Stop. Why did you go to New York?"
"RORY: To see Jess."
"LORELAI: Boy, do you know how to bury the lead."
"RORY: I don't know what happened."
"LORELAI: You went to New York to see Jess."
"RORY: It was the stroke! It made me someone else, and after his phone call last night -"
"LORELAI: That was him?"
"RORY: It did something to me, I don't know what. In fact, you should take the phone away from me, too. That's right, add it to the list. No books, no music, no phone."
"LORELAI: Okay, Rory. . ."
"RORY: I'm a horrible person."
"LORELAI: You're not a horrible person."
"RORY: I am sick, I'm ill, I'm cracked. This is not who I am. If I were to write this down in my diary and I would read it, I would be like, Who is this freak? This isn't me. This isn't my diary. I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't skip school when I have finals coming up to go see a guy that isn't even my guy and end up missing my mother's graduation, which I wanted to be at so badly. That's someone else. That's someone flighty and stupid and dumb and girly. And, I mean, I missed your graduation, which is the worst thing I could have possibly done. I mean, I hurt you and I had to spend hours on a stinky bus next to a guy that was spitting into a can, just thinking about all of the minutes that were going by that I wasn't at your graduation and they were hurting you, and they should have been hurting you because it was so selfish of this person who wasn't me to do what she did."
"LORELAI: Okay, my God, take a breath."
"RORY: I don't deserve a breath. No breaths. You should add that to the list. You should b*at me, ground me, take the phone away and deprive me of air."
"LORELAI: Okay, look, nobody wants to say this any less than me, but I - maybe you don't have a medical condition or a mental problem. Maybe, honey, you are falling for Jess."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Well -"
"RORY: No, I love Dean. Dean is my boyfriend. He will always be my boyfriend. That's it. Forever."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe not forever."
"RORY: Yes, forever. I love Dean and Jess is gone now and everything's going to be good again. Everything's going to be all right."
"LORELAI: Rory, you cut school."
"RORY: Yeah, I know."
"LORELAI: You got on a bus and went to a strange city in your uniform to see Jess."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: Well, that doesn't mean nothing. That means something. I mean--"
"RORY: No! I don't want to talk about this anymore. The only thing I want to talk about is the list I made on the bus of all the ways I'm gonna make this up to you. You get total control over the remote and the stereo for as long as you want. Total control over takeout food choices and a special surprise present every day for a month and -- oh my God! I left your present on the bus."
"LORELAI: What present?"
"RORY: It was a vinyl copy of The Go-Gos original album and it was signed by Belinda, but it's not the only copy and I'm gonna find another copy. That's going on the list, too."
"LORELAI: Okay, honey, please. Forget about the list until tomorrow."
"RORY: Okay, I'll just go to bed then and...I'll go to my room."
"LORELAI: Hold on one second. Does this mean I have to eat alone?"
"RORY: Well, it's up to you. Sending me to bed without supper, you can't lose with that punishment. It's a classic."
"LORELAI: I'd rather go out with my daughter tonight."
"RORY: I don't deserve it."
"LORELAI: No, but I do."
"RORY: Okay, just let me take a shower and get the horrible smell of this horrible day off of me, and then we'll go anywhere you want, my treat, and I won't enjoy it. And then we'll come home and I'll go straight to bed and I'll have a terrible night's sleep, okay?"
"LORELAI: Sounds great."
"RORY: I'm so, so sorry, Mom."
"LORELAI: Oh, really? 'Cause you didn't make that clear."
"RORY: I won't be long."

"OPEN AT INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Michel, and Sookie are sitting at a table in the dining room listening to music]"
"SOOKIE: Huh?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, you've gotta be kidding."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: You cannot walk down the aisle to that."
"SOOKIE: Why?"
"LORELAI: It's depressing."
"SOOKIE: It's Ella."
"LORELAI: It's morbid."
"SOOKIE: It's a classic song."
"LORELAI: A classic song with lyrics about a woman who can't make her relationship work, whose life is filled with emptiness and regret and pain."
"SOOKIE: Oh, who listens to the lyrics?"
"LORELAI: Anybody not hanging out with Annie Sullivan by the water pump."
"RORY: What are these?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, those are some alternative songs, but I really like this one the best."
"LORELAI: Alternative songs, good. Let's see. Hey Jude."
"SOOKIE: Paul wrote it for Julian to cheer him up."
"LORELAI: Seasons in the Sun?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, a sentimental favorite."
"LORELAI: Cat's in the Cradle?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, it makes you re-examine your priorities."
"LORELAI: Don't Cry Out Loud? Sookie, do you even like Jackson?"
"MICHEL: Okay, I have a wonderful suggestion."
"LORELAI: Great, let's hear it."
"MICHEL: Okay, here we go. How about I leave?"
"LORELAI: And then do what?"
"MICHEL: That's it. I leave and I don't have to listen to this insanity anymore. What do you think, huh? Because I love it."
"LORELAI: Michel, I am in the wedding, which means you have to run the wedding all by yourself, something you've never done before."
"MICHEL: Oh, please."
"RORY: I'll tell you what, Sookie. How about Lane and I come up with a few more suggestions for you? Still melodic, but not quite as Girl, Interrupted."
"SOOKIE: All right, fine."
"LORELAI: Great. Michel, how's the RSVP list coming?"
"MICHEL: Well, I must say this has been especially challenging for me. I mean, when you are talking about a wedding with up to forty people all living within a five mile radius, how can one person be expected to keep track of all of that?"
"LORELAI: Just an answer will do."
"MICHEL: I mean, it got a little hairy there for a moment  I almost had to use a second sheet of paper, you know."
"LORELAI: You know, I'm not gonna let you annoy me out of making you handle this."
"MICHEL: Oh, we'll see."
"SOOKIE: Hey, my cousin Carl canceled so I have two empty seats. Anyone else you wanna invite?"
"RORY: I've got Lane, I've got Dean, I'm good."
"SOOKIE: What about Emily and Richard?"
"LORELAI: Emily and Richard who?"
"SOOKIE: Your Emily and Richard."
"LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, you are way too sweet."
"SOOKIE: What? She went to all that trouble to help me plan the first phase of the wedding."
"LORELAI: The crazy phase of the wedding."
"SOOKIE: It was still sweet and I appreciated it. I mean, if it wasn't for your mother, I never would've settled on the color pink."
"LORELAI: Why is that?"
"SOOKIE: Well, I wanted yellow and she said no."
"LORELAI: Oh, with logic like that."
"SOOKIE: Come on, just ask her. I want you to."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll ask her."
"SOOKIE: Good."
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"SOOKIE: It's get happier the second time you hear it."
"LORELAI: Unh."
"SOOKIE: Huh? Snappier, isn't it?"

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Rory, Lorelai, and Emily are sitting in the living room before dinner.]"
"LORELAI: Huh. You know what I just realized? Oy is the funniest word in the entire world."
"RORY: Huh."
"LORELAI: I mean, think about it. You never hear the word oy and not smile. Impossible. Funny, funny word."
"EMILY: Oh, dear God."
"LORELAI: Poodle is another funny word."
"EMILY: Please drink your drink, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: In fact, if you put oy and poodle together in the same sentence, you'd have a great new catch phrase, you know? Like, oy with the poodles already. So from now on, when the perfect circumstances arise, we will use our favorite new catch phrase."
"RORY: Oy with the poodles already."
"LORELAI: I'm telling you, it's knocking whatcha talking bout, Willis?' right out of first place."
"EMILY: Lorelai, for God's sake, be quiet."
"MAID: Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: Bless you, Inga. Please go tell Mr. Gilmore. He's in his den."
"MAID: Yes, ma'am."
"EMILY: Shall we?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey Mom, uh, Sookie wanted to know if you and Dad would like to come to her wedding."
"EMILY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's gonna be great. Small, low key, but fun. She's catering it herself so the food'll be fantastic, and you'd get to see me and Rory walk down the aisle in two of the least obnoxious bridesmaid dresses ever created."
"EMILY: Well, that sounds very nice. When is it?"
"LORELAI: A week from Sunday."
"EMILY: A week from Sunday?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: The wedding is in one week?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: So this is a pity invite?"
"LORELAI: A what?"
"EMILY: Someone canceled at the last minute and rather than being left with two empty seats, Sookie asked you to ask us. How nice."
"LORELAI: That's not what happened."
"EMILY: No, that's quite all right. Far be it from me to be invited with the first batch of actual wanted guests. This is just fine."
"LORELAI: Mom, it's not a pity invite. She really wants you to come."
"EMILY: Is that so?"
"LORELAI: Yes, that's so."
"EMILY: Where's our invitation?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Our invitation. I mean, she must've at least given you an invitation to give us."
"LORELAI: She thought it would be more special coming directly from me."
"EMILY: So she was out of invitations. I never felt so special."
"LORELAI: Mom, she wants you to come. There's no reason to be insulted here."
"EMILY: I guess I should be thrilled that I didn't just get a call from the road as you were on your way there."
"LORELAI: Do not turn this into something that it's not."
"EMILY: Do we have a choice between chicken or fish, or at this point do we just bring our own?"
"LORELAI: Stop."
"EMILY: Perhaps she would also like us to pick up some extra ice along the way, or help out parking the cars."
"LORELAI: Mom, look, isn't Rory pretty?"
"RICHARD: Apologies all around. I could not get Adamson off the phone."
"LORELAI: Dad, glad you're here. We're just talking about how pretty Rory is. Big eyes, baby. Give him the Bambi face."
"RICHARD: Oh, Rory gets lovelier every day."
"RORY: Why, thank you, Grandpa."
"EMILY: Oh Richard?"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"EMILY: Guess what Lorelai just told me?"
"RICHARD: What?"
"EMILY: We are invited to Sookie's wedding."
"RICHARD: Oh, how nice. When is it?"
"EMILY: A week from Sunday."
"RICHARD: Oh, so it's a pity invite."
"EMILY: Ha!"
"LORELAI: Oy with the poodles already."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory and Dean are at a table eating breakfast.]"
"RORY: How are your pancakes?"
"DEAN: Good."
"RORY: Good or really good?"
"DEAN: Good."
"RORY: So, not really good?"
"DEAN: Fine, really good."
"RORY: Okay. But are they great?"
"DEAN: Rory, uh, would you perhaps like to trade breakfasts?"
"RORY: You mean, your pancakes for my eggs?"
"DEAN: Yup."
"RORY: Um, okay. Wow, you're crazy, these pancakes are great."
"[Lorelai walks by the window outside]"
"DEAN: That's twelve."
"RORY: Mm, two more and she'll come in."
"DEAN: I don't know. She's been walking back and forth out there for twenty minutes and she still hasn't made it to the door."
"RORY: Yeah, but look how much closer to the building she's gotten."
"DEAN: Why don't we just bring her something out?"
"RORY: No. She and Luke have been in this fight for too long, she's gotta do this."
"DEAN: You're cruel."
"RORY: Tough love, baby. Oops, I think she's coming in."
"DEAN: How can you tell?"
"RORY: She's got shoe sale face on."
"[Lorelai walks in and sits down]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I did it, I'm in."
"RORY: Good girl."
"LORELAI: It wasn't so bad. Took awhile, but not so bad. Wait, why are you eating?"
"RORY: You took thirty minutes to come in."
"LORELAI: But I'm here now and hey, I'm like cheese."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: She gets better with time."
"DEAN: Ah."
"RORY: Sorry gouda, we've got school."
"LORELAI: But "
"RORY: Order breakfast and I'll leave you the paper."
"LORELAI: No, but "
"RORY: I'll see you tonight."
"LORELAI: Dean, don't leave me."
"RORY: You'll do fine. You'll do fine."
"[Rory and Dean leave; Lorelai walks up to Luke at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hello."
"LORELAI: Oh, good donut selection this morning, really. Good variety, good color, good goodness, good . . . Well, so the choices are there. It all comes down to what I'm in the mood for. Sprinkled or chocolate or jelly or glazed, maple or kiki or apple or, uh, raised. Little donut rhyme there. Never mind. Can I have a chocolate and a sprinkled please?"
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: So, this is how it's gonna be with us now, huh?"
"LUKE: No idea what you're talking about."
"LORELAI: You're pulling a Mr. Freeze on me."
"LUKE: I'm not pulling a Mr. Freeze on you."
"LORELAI: Please. I'm gonna need snow chains just to get out of here."
"LUKE: I assume you want coffee with your donuts."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, Luke. It was a bad night. I completely freaked out. I said some things. . .did you get my note? I wrote you a note."
"LUKE: Got your note."
"LORELAI: You got my note. Did you read my note?"
"LUKE: Read your note."
"LORELAI: And?"
"LUKE: It was very well-written"
"LORELAI: That's it?"
"LUKE: I also enjoyed the Garfield stationary. That's one funny cat."
"LORELAI: I said I was sorry, Luke."
"LUKE: Yes, you did."
"LORELAI: I said it like a million times."
"LUKE: You said it four times, but I understand you're embellishing for dramatic effects."
"LORELAI: Stop."
"LUKE: Stop what?"
"LORELAI: Oh, stop this robot talk. If you're mad, just act like you're mad at me."
"LUKE: I'm not mad at you."
"LORELAI: You're being really, really unfair. Rory was in the hospital."
"LUKE: Lorelai, what is it exactly that you want me to do? I'm not mad, I'm not holding a grudge, I heard your apology, I feel I'm being polite, I listened to your donut bit, I got you your coffee. What would make you happy?"
"LORELAI: I want Luke back."
"LUKE: He's standing right here."
"LORELAI: No, he's not."
"[Lorelai walks out of the diner]"
"CUT TO CHILTON AUDITORIUM"
"[Paris is at a podium on stage addressing a room full of students]"
"PARIS: Better drinking fountains, updated lockers, clearly marked boys' and girls' restrooms, non-dairy and wheat-free alternatives to the cafeteria, a larger voice in the monetary dispersal of charitable funds donated to our institution  because it is our institution, yours and mine. Remember people, if Chilton soars, we soar. If Chilton fails, we fail. It is up to us, we must get involved, we must care. It is not enough to sign a petition to get a Little Debbie machine installed in the senior corridor. Snack cakes will not change the world. Cream filling will not decide our legacy. How will future generations of Chilton students remember the class of 2003? John F. Kennedy once said, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Those eloquent words are just as relevant to here in this hall today. What can you, the future of Chilton, of America, of the world, what can you do for your school? I will tell you what you can do. You can vote for me, Paris Gellar, for student body president, and let me start tomorrow for you today. Thank you."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Reese McGinly, Schatzi Leason and Paris Gellar, your presidential candidates for next year. Elections will be held this Friday. Good luck to all of you. This concludes today's assembly. You are all dismissed."
"[As people exit the auditorium, Paris walks over to Rory, who is writing in a notebook]"
"PARIS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"PARIS: Did you get the Little Debbie comment?"
"RORY: Uh huh."
"PARIS: All of it? The cream filling, the snack cake?"
"RORY: Every delicious morsel."
"PARIS: Good, good. So, how do you think it went?"
"RORY: I think it went fine."
"PARIS: Fine, as is better than Reese and Schatzi?"
"RORY: Fine as in fine."
"PARIS: Well, how are you skewing the article?"
"RORY: Well, you'll have to wait and read about it in the Franklin like everyone else."
"PARIS: Fine, write whatever you want."
"RORY: I will."
"PARIS: Just make sure you mention that Schatzi pulling the Sharon Stone/Basic Instinct bit was a cheap attempt to distract the whole student body from my mandatory recycling program."
"RORY: Go away, Randolph."
"[Madeline and Paris enter the auditorium]"
"MADELINE: We got it!"
"PARIS: [walks over to them] You do? Well, come on, tell me."
"LOUISE: Okay, a hundred and fifty students were polled."
"MADELINE: A total cross section."
"LOUISE: We talked to people that we should never have even had to stand near."
"MADELINE: The hairstyles alone proved the Farrelly brothers are not making this stuff up."
"PARIS: I'm sorry, have I ever been mistaken for a patient person?"
"MADELINE: Right, sorry. Okay, so we added the votes up."
"PARIS: You added?"
"MADELINE: She added."
"PARIS: Good, continue."
"MADELINE: Okay, when asked which of the three candidates is the most qualified for the job of president, ninety percent said you."
"PARIS: Really?"
"LOUISE: And when asked who of the three candidates would be the most competent president, overwhelmingly the answer was once again you."
"PARIS: So that's it, I'm in."
"MADELINE: Not quite."
"PARIS: How is that not quite? Most competent and most qualified, what else is there?"
"LOUISE: Well, we also polled likability."
"PARIS: And?"
"MADELINE: And while people think you're smart. . ."
"PARIS: And competent."
"LOUISE: And competent, they also find you, well, a tad. . ."
"MADELINE: Scary."
"LOUISE: Someone thought a Halloween mask of you would sell big."
"PARIS: Well, fine, they don't like me. Big deal, right? I'm still most competent."
"LOUISE: Yes, but when asked if the likability issue would affect their voting choice, almost a hundred percent said yes."
"PARIS: That's crazy. You mean, people would rather vote for a moronic twink who they liked over someone who could actually do the job?"
"LOUISE: Sad, but true."
"PARIS: Well, what do I do?"
"MADELINE: Hope for a sex scandal?"
"PARIS: Louise?"
"LOUISE: Oh, I'm on it."
"[Louise and Madeline leave. Paris walks back over to Rory.]"
"PARIS: Hey."
"RORY: Tomorrow with everyone else."
"PARIS: So, I have been wracking my brains for weeks trying to figure out exactly who should be my vice presidential candidate, you know? Who would be yin to my yang, Joel to my Ethan, Damon to my Affleck, and then suddenly, it hits me  the perfect person."
"RORY: Who?"
"PARIS: You."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: It's genius. We could announce it in the Franklin tomorrow, Gellar and Gilmore. We even have the g-thing going. Never underestimate the power of alliteration, my friend."
"RORY: I don't wanna be vice president."
"PARIS: Oh, come on. Every little girl wants to be vice president."
"RORY: Not this one."
"PARIS: But you have to. It's the only way. Please? I'm begging you."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: They hate me, okay?"
"RORY: Who hates you?"
"PARIS: Everyone. Everyone in the whole school hates me. Oh, yeah, they think I'm the best for the job, but they don't want to go to the mall with me so they won't vote for me and that means I'm going to lose."
"RORY: Well, how is my running with you gonna change anything?"
"PARIS: Because people think you're nice. You're quiet, you say excuse me, you look like little birds help you get dressed in the morning. People don't fear you."
"RORY: Hey, I haven't been dressed by a bird since I was two."
"PARIS: You will soften my image."
"RORY: You're crazy."
"PARIS: Please!"
"RORY: No, I don't want to be in politics. I just want to write about politics."
"PARIS: You wouldn't have to do anything. I'll do all the work and make the speeches. You just have to sit there and be nice."
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: But "
"RORY: Bye."
"PARIS: Harvard loves this kid of crap. Being vice president is just one more thing to put you ahead of the rest of the hundreds of thousands of straightA students who are applying for the same spot you are. Think about it. You say no, then comes the day when the letter from Harvard arrives. They've turned you down. Enjoy Connecticut State, sucker. Tell me you won't be thinking, what if I had just run with Paris? What if the one thing that could've ensured my place behind those ivy covered walls I just walked away from?"
"RORY: Fine."
"PARIS: Yes! Okay."
"RORY: I guess the thought of just being nice to people never occurred to you, huh?"
"PARIS: See, that is exactly what I need from you, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm for the new millennium. Hey, wear some braids tomorrow with bows. I mean, hell, let's sell it, sister!"
"CUT TO DOCTOR'S OFFICE"
"[Rory sits on the exam table as Lorelai stands next to her]"
"LORELAI: So, how do you feel?"
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: Not at all sad?"
"RORY: About getting my arm back? No."
"LORELAI: Really? Cause I've kind of gotten used to Casty over here. I mean, we decorated him, we talked to him, we protected him from getting wet in the shower."
"RORY: Okay, it's time to wean you off of getting attached to inanimate objects."
"LORELAI: Casty, no one understands you like I do. What? No, I did not know Mr. Band-Aid said that to you. Ugh, I will talk to him when we get home."
"[The doctor walks into the room]"
"DR. SUE: How you doing?"
"RORY: Dr. Sue, thank God."
"DR. SUE: Okay. So Rory, let's get this thing off your arm, huh? What do you say?"
"RORY: Not a word."
"CHRISTOPHER: [from hallway] This one here? Wait, which one? Hey, you in the white, come on, point a finger."
"RORY: Dad?"
"LORELAI: Christopher? [pulls open the door]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Aha, there you are. Is it still on?"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, great, I didn't miss it. Hey, doctor, I'm the dad."
"DR. SUE: Hey, nice to meet you, Dad."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you're here."
"CHRISTOPHER: Why? I told you last week I wanted to come down for the big unveiling."
"LORELAI: I know, but I didn't think you would drive all the way from Boston again. You were just here."
"CHRISTOPHER: You getting sick of me?"
"LORELAI: Frankly, yes."
"DR. SUE: Okay, is everyone here now?"
"RORY: I think so."
"DR. SUE: Okay, then let's do it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Great, and doctor, if at all possible, we'd like to keep the arm."
"DR. SUE: Oh, I'll try my best."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Christopher walk down the street]"
"CHRISTOPHER: So where to next?"
"RORY: Um, actually, I have to get home. I have to review my campaign platform."
"CHRISTOPHER: Campaign platform?"
"LORELAI: Yes, our little Hilary Clinton here is running for student body vice president."
"CHRISTOPHER: Wow."
"RORY: Elections are on Friday, but I can honestly say that I'm very torn about which way I want it to go."
"LORELAI: I spent four hours making picture buttons. You wanna win."
"RORY: But if I win then I have to be vice president next year. Plus, I'll have to spend my summer in Washington for some junior leadership program, which means six straight weeks of me and Paris together in a dorm room."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, how about this? I'll come back here on Thursday night and I'll take you guys to dinner, and then we'll break into Chilton and tamper with some votes."
"RORY: We can't."
"LORELAI: Thursday's Sookie's rehearsal dinner."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh well, I guess you'll just have to put your trust in a democratic system. Good luck with that."
"LORELAI: But if you're gonna be in the area Thursday night, you can come with us to the dinner."
"CHRISTOPHER: But it's Sookie's rehearsal dinner."
"LORELAI: Oh, she would love it. She's cooking for a thousand. It'll be fun."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm bringing Dean."
"LORELAI: I mean, if you can't do it, then. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: What time?"
"LORELAI: Seven thirty."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm there."
"LORELAI: That's great. I'll tell her."
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[The house is full of people for the rehearsal dinner. Kirk starts tapping on his glass]"
"MISS PATTY: Ooh, ooh, a toast, everybody, a toast!"
"KIRK: Ladies, gentlemen, honored guests. Who owns the silver Volvo cause you're blocking me in?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, it's better than the toast he made at the Ubromowitz wedding."
"CHRISTOPHER: How long before I move the car?"
"LORELAI: Hm, give it another ten minutes."
"KIRK: Come on, I've gotta go. My mom is waiting. This isn't funny!"
"[Jackson walks up to Sookie in the kitchen]"
"JACKSON: We need to talk."
"SOOKIE: What's the matter?"
"JACKSON: Uh, the bedroom, please."
"SOOKIE: Honey, I'm melting chocolate here."
"JACKSON: Oh, the chocolate can wait. My father just took me aside and handed me this. [holds up a kilt]"
"SOOKIE: He handed you a skirt?"
"JACKSON: Oh, it's not a skirt, it's a kilt."
"SOOKIE: Oh. Why did he hand this to you?"
"JACKSON: He gave this to me to wear on my wedding day."
"SOOKIE: No."
"JACKSON: Oh, yes. He wore it on his wedding day, my grandfather wore it on his wedding day. Apparently, there's a long-standing tradition where the men in my family get very airy on the big day."
"SOOKIE: Well, honey, if it means that much to him."
"JACKSON: Are you crazy?"
"SOOKIE: Well, he's your father."
"JACKSON: You won't let me wear shorts in public and you're gonna let me get married in this?"
"SOOKIE: Well, what're you gonna do?"
"JACKSON: I'm gonna wear pants. If he doesn't like it, he doesn't have to come."
"SOOKIE: He has to come, he's the best man."
"JACKSON: Too bad! [walks away]"
"SOOKIE: [follows him] Jackson, come on. Shorts are different, they cut you funny!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, that's it, I need some air. Grab the bottle."
"LORELAI: Bossy. I like it."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Christopher walk out and sit on the front porch]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Wow. I hope the second act's as good as the first one."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it's a wedding. Things are supposed to be horrible."
"CHRISTOPHER: When Jackson came out holding that kilt  man, I felt for him."
"LORELAI: I know, so did I."
"CHRISTOPHER: Please, I saw what your face was doing."
"LORELAI: What? What was my face doing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: It was counting up how many Brigadoon references you could come up with to torture him with at a later date."
"LORELAI: How dare you accuse my face of that! My face is calling Gloria Alred when we get home."
"CHRISTOPHER: How many references?"
"LORELAI: None."
"CHRISTOPHER: How many?"
"LORELAI: Twelve, including a few bars of I'll Go Home with Bonnie Jean."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'm begging you, take plenty of pictures of this wedding because I have a feeling it's gonna be a classic."
"LORELAI: You know, if you're gonna be in town for the day, you should just come with us and. . .thanks. . .see all the fireworks for yourself."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Just like that, okay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, if Sookie doesn't mind."
"LORELAI: What's going on with you?"
"CHRISTOPHER: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I mean, mister suddenly I'm everywhere'. How come you can just agree to come to the wedding?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Because I can."
"LORELAI: Don't you have to check your appointment book?"
"CHRISTOPHER: It's on a Sunday."
"LORELAI: Don't you have to check with Sherry? Chris, what's up?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Nothing. Sherry's not in town."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"CHRISTOPHER: And even if she was, I still don't think she'd mind if I went."
"LORELAI: Because she's the coolest chick in the world?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Because things aren't going too well for us lately."
"LORELAI: Oh, no."
"CHRISTOPHER: She had this big business trip planned and before she left, we had a talk."
"LORELAI: Yikes."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. We tried to come up with some answers but we couldn't think of anything, so she left and we said we'd take this time apart to think."
"LORELAI: What have you been thinking?"
"CHRISTOPHER: About finding an apartment."
"LORELAI: Wow, um, that's so weird. Last time I saw you two, you were. . .well, nauseating, actually."
"CHRISTOPHER: Believe me, we made ourselves sick a few times."
"LORELAI: I don't know what to say."
"CHRISTOPHER: No, there's nothing to say. It's nobody's fault. It just isn't it."
"LORELAI: You okay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks."
"LORELAI: Well, then, it's decided. You'll come with me to Sookie's wedding and you'll make sure I stop one or two Brigadoon-isms shy of Jackson taking me out with a bagpipe."
"CHRISTOPHER: It would be my pleasure."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[The next morning, Rory is sitting in the living room as Lorelai walks down the stairs]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, I'm so tired."
"RORY: Hey Mom?"
"LORELAI: Yes, angel?"
"RORY: Do you happen to know where the almonds I made for table five went?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Cause they were here last night before Sookie's dinner."
"LORELAI: Really? How odd?"
"RORY: Yeah. And this morning, I found some tulle on the staircase leading up to your bedroom."
"LORELAI: Hmm. Ghosts?"
"RORY: It took me six hours to make those almond bundles, Mother."
"LORELAI: Well, see if you can b*at that next time."
"RORY: So you got home late from Sookie's?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I stayed to help her clean up a little. Hey, guess what?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I know something you don't know."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Okay, just remember, it's really wrong to gossip, unless it's true or just way too good not to tell everyone you see, whether you know them or not."
"RORY: Got it, what is it?"
"LORELAI: Well  [phone rings] Aw, if that's my conscience calling, tell it enough already, I heard it the first time."
"RORY: [answers phone] Hello?"
"PARIS: How's this sound for a template? I have done my best. I have lost. Mr. Nixon has won. The democratic process has worked its will, so now let's get on with the urgent task of uniting this country."
"RORY: What is that?"
"PARIS: Hubert Humphrey's concession speech. Now, other than the part about Nixon, parts of it really seem to apply here."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Hey, I'm not going to steal it. I'll paraphrase and I'll give him credit."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Not that the person who actually wins will even know who Hubert Humphrey is, but hey, I bet they'll organize one boffo senior ditch day."
"RORY: Where are you?"
"PARIS: In the auditorium. I wanted to be here for one last meet and greet, get them right before they walk in the booth."
"RORY: Leave that place right now."
"PARIS: But  ."
"RORY: People will think that you're insane and generally people are scared of the insane, so see where I'm going here?"
"PARIS: I'm going to lose."
"RORY: You don't know that."
"PARIS: Yes, I do. Because even if I win, I only won because of you. Therefore, either way I lose."
"RORY: Come on. Go get a cup of coffee, relax. You deserve this job, I swear. Put away the concession speech."
"PARIS: Hubert Humphrey must not have been considered very fun either."
"RORY: I'll see you at school. [hangs up] God, she wants to win so badly, and me, not so badly. I feel terrible."
"LORELAI: Aw, come on. You know you wanna win so you can spend your whole summer in Washington far away from me."
"RORY: Please, don't even talk about Washington. It gives me a stomachache."
"LORELAI: It might be wonderful."
"RORY: Good, then you and I will go someday."
"LORELAI: Aw, look at you, trying to make Mommy feel like you don't spend every night tunneling out of here with a spoon."
"RORY: Get back to the gossip, please."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. Okay. So, guess who's in the process of breaking up?"
"RORY: Brad and Jen?"
"LORELAI: Bite your tongue."
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Sherry and your dad."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: Dad told you that?"
"LORELAI: Last night."
"RORY: Wow. But they were so together."
"LORELAI: I know. Well, now they're not."
"RORY: Well, is he  oh, look at you."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: You're totally gloating."
"LORELAI: I'm not gloating."
"RORY: Then why are you smiling?"
"LORELAI: I'm not smiling. I had a little stroke."
"RORY: Smiling."
"LORELAI: Oh, look, if he was all broken up about it then I would be sad, but he's not, so ha ha."
"RORY: Fourth rung of hell, party of one."
"LORELAI: Well, at least my feet won't get cold."
"[Lorelai pulls something out of her pocket and puts it in her mouth]"
"RORY: Where'd you get that?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: That. The Jordan almond that you pulled out of your pajama top and ate  where did you get it?"
"LORELAI: Hm, Santa Claus."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN LOBBY"
"[Michel pulls on his coat and walks up to Lorelai near the front desk]"
"MICHEL: All right, the piano movers will be here at eight and the chairs will be set up at nine. All the rooms are made up and ready. I will be in at ten. Now I am going home unless you would like me to stay."
"LORELAI: Actually, I would, thanks."
"MICHEL: No, I'm sorry, I think I said that wrong. I am going home now unless you would like me to stay."
"LORELAI: I would love you to stay, thanks for offering."
"MICHEL: Okay, see, once again, my English not so good. One more time. I am going home now after working six hours longer than I usually work and performing tasks I despise and am ashamed of, and now I am going home to wash off the stench of this horrifying day, that is, unless, for some unknown Godforsaken reason, you need me to stay."
"LORELAI: Well, actually  ."
"MICHEL: Goodbye. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Hey, can I grab my bag? I'm gonna go in the back and change."
"EMPLOYEE: [hands her the bag] Sure."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"SOOKIE: Hey, I went with the sugared daffodils for the top tier. Let me tell you, they look great. Ooh, I've outdone myself this time."
"LORELAI: What are you still doing here?"
"SOOKIE: I just wanted to double check everything for tomorrow. Don't worry, I'm done, everything's fine. I'm now going straight to bed."
"LORELAI: Your last night as a single woman."
"SOOKIE: Yup."
"LORELAI: You still look good."
"SOOKIE: I still feel good."
"LORELAI: Just think of it. As of tomorrow, you can start wearing cold cream to bed and stop shaving your legs."
"SOOKIE: That's right, cause I already got me a man."
"LORELAI: Go to sleep."
"SOOKIE: Okay, see you tomorrow?"
"LORELAI: See you tomorrow."

"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Later that night, Lorelai is decorating the lobby as Christopher walks down the steps.]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, look who's got Martha Stewart locked in a basement. Did you do all this?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I did. How's it look?"
"CHRISTOPHER: It looks great."
"LORELAI: Good. What are you doing up?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Couldn't sleep. I sweet-talked the maid into leaving me about ten thousand pillow mints and then I proceeded to eat them all."
"LORELAI: Serves you right. Oh God, I'm so exhausted."
"CHRISTOPHER: Need some help?"
"[they sit down on the couch]"
"LORELAI: No, I'm almost done. I got up and went back to work just now, didn't I?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, you did."
"LORELAI: Oh, good, cause this is not the time to loaf. I'm so happy for Sookie. I mean, it's like a real live love story, and I saw it all happen. I mean, I hired Jackson. I watched them meet. I watched them have several bizarrely intense arguments over mustard greens. I watched them fall in love. I got to see it all. It was a nice show. Hi."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hi."
"[they kiss]"
"LORELAI: What was that?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I have no idea."
"[they kiss again]"
"LORELAI: Chris."
"CHRISTOPHER: One more time and maybe I'll have an explanation."
"[they kiss again]"
"LORELAI: Ah, this is not happening."
"CHRISTOPHER: I hope to God you're wrong."
"LORELAI: But it's us. I mean, you and I, we. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: Have never been in the same place at the same time."
"LORELAI: But now. . . [they kiss] My head is spinning."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's all the plants in here, too much oxygen."
"LORELAI: What do we do now?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You know, I've got a room upstairs."
"LORELAI: You were that sure you'd get lucky?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I never dreamed I'd get this lucky."
"LORELAI: Aw, that's good."
"CHRISTOPHER: So what do you say?"
"[They walk toward the staircase]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Later that night, Lorelai walks down the stairs and into the kitchen. Sookie is working on her wedding cake while wearing her wedding dress and veil.]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"SOOKIE: Daffodils. Am I insane? You can't have daffodils on your wedding cake. What was I thinking?"
"LORELAI: Stop what you're doing right now."
"SOOKIE: There's too much pink."
"LORELAI: Sweetie, there's not too much pink."
"SOOKIE: Pink is for girls. Jackson's not a girl. Jackson doesn't like pink. I have all this pink, it's like saying, Hey, screw you. You want a say in this? Well, grow some ovaries.'"
"LORELAI: Hey, whoa, honey, hey! Put the pastry bag down."
"SOOKIE: I can't, I have to fix this."
"LORELAI: Sookie, down. Now step away from all things edible. Hey, what happened?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: When I left you, you were fine."
"SOOKIE: I know. And when I went home, I was fine. And when I went to bed, I was fine. And then I had this dream where suddenly my dress is really, really short in back, you know? So I bolt out of bed and I put my dress on, and it looks okay. But then I panic  what if I'm remembering the dream wrong? What if my dress isn't really screwed up, what if it's my veil? So I put on the veil, then I remember I'm serving salmon puffs. Salmon puffs! Okay, completely wrong, so I had to rush over here and try to find another first course, and then I walk in and these daffodils just. . .something snapped and that's when you walked in here."
"LORELAI: Honey, you're nervous. It's natural."
"SOOKIE: Well, I wasn't nervous until tonight."
"LORELAI: Well, that's okay."
"SOOKIE: I'm scared."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: I don't wanna get divorced."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: I don't wanna fight all the time and end up bitter."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: I don't wanna be one of those women sitting around making jokes about husband number two. I want number one to last."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: I want a guarantee."
"LORELAI: Sookie, you're gonna be fine."
"SOOKIE: I know. No, I don't. Okay, I need to stop obsessing on this. Tell me something."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. Anything. Tell me something to make me stop thinking about this."
"LORELAI: I just slept with Christopher."
"SOOKIE: That'll work."
"LORELAI: It just happened."
"SOOKIE: When?"
"LORELAI: Tonight, in his room."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God! Was it. . .?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah."
"SOOKIE: Wow, what does this mean?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"SOOKIE: I mean, is this a good thing?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I think it is."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, can you imagine if you and Christopher got together after all these years?"
"LORELAI: Okay, hold on. We haven't even talked about that ourselves yet."
"SOOKIE: Ah, ooh God! Oh God."
"LORELAI: I know!"
"SOOKIE: Well, when are you gonna talk about it?"
"LORELAI: Probably when I go back up there with the snacks I promised."
"SOOKIE: He's waiting for you?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he is."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, you've gotta get back up there."
"LORELAI: You have to get some sleep."
"SOOKIE: I wanna hear all the details tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Mmkay, I'll grab you in between the walking down the aisle and the getting married."
"[Sookie starts to leave]"
"LORELAI: Hey Sookie."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: You're in your wedding dress."
"SOOKIE: I am."
"LORELAI: You're beautiful."
"[Lorelai walks over and hugs her]"
"LORELAI: Now you go get some sleep."
"SOOKIE: And you go get some."
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS"
"[Lorelai walks into Christopher's room with a plate of food.]"
"LORELAI: Room service."
"CHRISTOPHER: I do like this hotel. Oh my God, that's good. What is it?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea, but if Sookie asks, Michel ate it."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, should we avoid the subject for awhile or just dive right in?"
"LORELAI: Call me Greg Louganis."
"CHRISTOPHER: Greg. What just happened here  amazing."
"LORELAI: I'm not arguing."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, does that mean there's a chance for a repeat amazing?"
"LORELAI: Do you mean right now or just in general?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Both. Let's start with in general."
"LORELAI: I don't know, Chris. It's weird, isn't it? We just found this great balance, I've been seeing you more, we've been getting along so well."
"CHRISTOPHER: I know."
"LORELAI: And this thing with Sherry is so recent."
"CHRISTOPHER: I know."
"LORELAI: And then there's Rory to think about. I mean, we can't just go changing everything on her now. Not unless. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: Not unless it's gonna be a pretty permanent change."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"CHRISTOPHER: And you're so sure it can't be?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not so sure."
"CHRISTOPHER: The timing seems right, Lor."
"LORELAI: I know it does."
"CHRISTOPHER: Maybe all this stuff we went through  that's the journey we needed to take to end up here."
"LORELAI: Maybe."
"CHRISTOPHER: Being a family  Mom, Dad, kid, Volvo."
"LORELAI: Ugh, the Volvo will have to go."
"CHRISTOPHER: It has a nice ring to it."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it does. I guess. . ."
"CHRISTOPHER: What?"
"LORELAI: I guess we'll never know until we try."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, we try?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, we try."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Kirk walks through the door]"
"KIRK: Luke, I've only got ten minutes. How quickly can you make me a ham on rye?"
"LUKE: I've never clocked it, Kirk."
"KIRK: Well, you think it could be fast?"
"LUKE: Yes, Kirk. Of all the sandwiches, I do believe the ham on rye is one of the faster ones to assemble."
"KIRK: What about a patty melt? Same time frame?"
"LUKE: Probably a little longer."
"KIRK: Really?"
"LUKE: Yes, I have to grill a hamburger whereas with the other one I just put the ham on the bread."
"KIRK: What if I wanted the bread on the ham on rye toasted? Are we talking somewhere in between the patty melt and the untoasted?"
"LUKE: Probably."
"KIRK: Closer to the melt or closer to the - ."
"LUKE: Kirk!"
"KIRK: Peanut butter and jelly to go."
"LUKE: Coming right up."
"KIRK: What do you think of this suit?"
"LUKE: It's fine."
"KIRK: I got it for Sookie's wedding. I read an article in the paper recently that said that weddings are an excellent place to meet women."
"LUKE: Well, if it was in the paper, it must be true."
"KIRK: I hope so, 'cause I'm so damn lonely not even Animal Planet does it for me anymore."
"LUKE: Your sandwich is coming right up. Caesar, I'm going upstairs for a minute."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke walks through the door and finds Jess inside]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"LUKE: How'd you get in here?"
"JESS: The door was open."
"LUKE: No, I mean, I was in the diner. I would've seen you come up the stairs. . . you know what, forget it, I don't wanna know. So, how's everything back home?"
"JESS: Fine."
"LUKE: Your mom?"
"JESS: Fine."
"LUKE: You in trouble?"
"JESS: Nah."
"LUKE: Then what the hell you doing here, Jess? You know, I, uh, I called you six times. Now I didn't expect you to call me back so we could sit on the phone in bed and watch Sleepless in Seattle together. I just expected you to call me back, say you got home, say no one mugged me on the bus, say you were okay. Say. . .you know what, never mind. Just tell me what it is you want. I got work to do."
"JESS: I wanna come back."
"LUKE: You what?"
"JESS: I want to come back."
"LUKE: Come back here?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: Here to Stars Hollow?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: To live in this apartment with me?"
"JESS: I said yes a million times already."
"LUKE: You know what, you're the one asking for something so you don't get to be James Dean this time, okay? Now, one more time, you wanna come back?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: Why?"
"JESS: I just, I. . . I just wanna come back."
"LUKE: You know what people told me when I said you were coming here to live with me? They told me I was crazy, they told me I was insane, they told me to start writing letters to Jodie Foster  but I ignored them. I was so sure that I knew what I was doing and then you showed up and you know what happened? You proved them right. I was crazy, and now after all that has happened, after all the chaos and havoc that you have wreaked, you're seriously standing there wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a butt with hands that are flipping me off, telling me you wanna come back?"
"JESS: You didn't pack up my stuff yet."
"LUKE: Uh, no, I've been a little busy."
"JESS: When were you planning on sending it back to me?"
"LUKE: What, hey, am I wearing a little brown uniform with UPS stamped on it?"
"JESS: So, what do you think?"
"LUKE: Things are gonna have to be different, Jess."
"JESS: I know."
"LUKE: Okay."
"JESS: Okay?"
"LUKE: So you're staying?"
"JESS: I'm staying."
"LUKE: Okay, then. Stay. I gotta get back to the diner."
"JESS: I'll help you close up later, all right?"
"LUKE: Sure. She's not home."
"JESS: Who?"
"LUKE: She's at Sookie's wedding with Dean, they're still together. They seem to have gotten through the whole car incident. They're doing really good, Dean and Rory."
"JESS: Good."
"LUKE: Just leave it alone, Jess. She's got a boyfriend. Just let it go."
"JESS: I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just going out for a walk."
"LUKE: You heard what I said?"
"JESS: Yeah, I heard what you said."

"DEAN: Thank you. You look beautiful."
"RORY: Thank you."
"DEAN: So, uh, how many cocktails caused that?"
"RORY: Oh, they haven't had any cocktails yet."
"DEAN: Really?"
"RORY: Oh yeah. When they start having cocktails, we're gonna have to hide you."
"DEAN: I'm looking forward to that. [his cell phone rings] Huh, I'm not sure who'd be calling me now. Hello?"
"PARIS: Dean?"
"DEAN: Who is this?"
"PARIS: It's Paris. I need to talk to Rory."
"DEAN: Uh, sure, hold on. [hands phone to Rory] It's Paris."
"RORY: What? [on phone] Hello?"
"PARIS: We've got the band!"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: We got the band! I knew we had most of the academic clubs tied up, but band  they were the wild card cause believe me, if anybody's going to be truly scared of me, it's some artsy loser with a tuba wrapped around his neck."
"RORY: Paris, how did you get this number?"
"PARIS: Oh, relax. I won't call you on Prince William's precious phone again. I just wanted you to know that we did it, we're in, welcome to the show. [hangs up]"
"RORY: I think we won."
"DEAN: Wow. Uh, that's great."
"RORY: Yeah."
"DEAN: So I guess this means you'll be spending the summer in Washington."
"RORY: Oh, nothing's decided yet, believe me. Let me do a little research and then I'll figure something out."
"DEAN: Good."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: You know what's really great about being a grown up? This. [holds up drink]"
"RORY: Well, thanks for the life lesson."
"LORELAI: You're welcome. Dean, you clean up really nicely."
"DEAN: Uh, thank you."
"LORELAI: You know, we're gonna have to hide him from Patty and Babette once they hit the hooch."
"RORY: Already told him."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I gotta check on some things. See you guys later."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Lorelai turns around and walked toward the porch. Christopher is walking toward her.]"
"LORELAI: Stop it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Stop what?"
"LORELAI: Stop looking at me like that or everyone here will think we did it. [they kiss] There, that'll throw them off the track."
"CHRISTOPHER: So this morning you woke up and felt sorry about last night?"
"LORELAI: No."
"CHRISTOPHER: Embarrassed about last night?"
"LORELAI: No."
"CHRISTOPHER: Eager and willing to repeat last night?"
"[Lorelai sees her parents walking toward them]"
"LORELAI: Ah, Mom, Dad, hi."
"CHRISTOPHER: Richard, Emily."
"RICHARD: Well, hello Christopher. What a pleasant surprise."
"LORELAI: You came."
"EMILY: Of course we came, we were invited. Hello Christopher. I mean, why did you think we would not come?"
"LORELAI: I thought you thought the invitation was rude."
"EMILY: It was rude. However, it would've been equally rude for us not to attend the wedding when we were perfectly capable of doing so, so we came. That's called rising above it."
"LORELAI: I see. Do you wanna come back down here long enough to get a drink?"
"EMILY: Yes, that would be nice."
"CHRSTOPHER: I'll get it for you."
"EMILY: Champagne, please."
"CHRISTOPHER: Should I make that two?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"RICHARD: I believe I'll join you, see what sort of scotch they're serving here."
"CHRISTOPHER: When I get back, you're gonna have to answer my last question."
"[Christopher and Richard walk away]"
"EMILY: What on earth is Christopher doing here?"
"LORELAI: Um, well, he's visiting his daughter."
"EMILY: That's very nice."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Actually, he's been visiting his daughter quite a bit lately."
"EMILY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. In fact, Mom, you might be seeing a lot more of Christopher from now on."
"EMILY: Because he'll be visiting his daughter?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he'll be visiting his daughter."
"EMILY: Well, I'll be damned."
"CUT TO WALKWAY"
"[Christopher and Rory are walking along a pathway]"
"CHRISTOPHER: So I'm guessing your mom talked to you?"
"RORY: She talks to me all the time, frequently when I'm begging her not to."
"CHRISTOPHER: And she told you what we discussed?"
"RORY: She mentioned something about it, yes."
"CHRISTOPHER: And what do you think about all this?"
"RORY: I don't know. What exactly are your intentions?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Your intentions  are they honorable?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Completely honorable."
"RORY: Yeah? Because we have been waiting for this for a really long time and we take disappointment extremely hard. I mean it, property damage is often involved."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I better follow through on this, huh?"
"RORY: I think that's an excellent idea."
"CHRISTOPHER: Come here, you. [they hug, his cell phone rings.] It's probably work."
"RORY: On a Sunday?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey lady, I've got a lot of responsibility now, okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: Be right back."
"[Christopher walks away. Rory sees Jess and walks over to him]"
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"JESS: Hello to you, too."
"RORY: Is everything okay?"
"JESS: You look nice."
"RORY: Thank you. What are you doing here?"
"JESS: I moved back."
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: I moved back."
"RORY: But  what  why?"
"JESS: Just wanted to."
"[Rory kisses him]"
"RORY: Oh my God! Oh my God!"
"JESS: Rory."
"RORY: Don't say a word!"
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: I have to go. [runs away] Oh, welcome home!"
"CUT TO BRIDGE"
"[Lorelai is standing on the bridge as Christopher walks up to her]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor!"
"LORELAI: Ah, hey there. We're starting any minute. Have you seen Rory?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, yeah, I just left her over there."
"LORELAI: Oh, good, okay, I'll find her. Go get a good seat. The wind's kicking up so this might be a really good show."
"CHRISTOPHER: I have to go."
"LORELAI: Huh, what, why?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I have to take care of something."
"LORELAI: Chris!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry, really. I'll call you later to see how it went."
"LORELAI: No, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What  tell me why you're leaving? What  what's going on?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sherry called. She's back."
"LORELAI: So you're going home. Gonna tell her you're moving out? No? Okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: I can't believe this. I mean, I really can't believe this."
"LORELAI: Uh, okay, I don't know. Um, just, uh, drive safe."
"CHRISTOPHER: Drive safe?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, drive safe. I mean, you know, you're still Rory's dad, right? So whatever happens or doesn't happen between us, I still need you to drive safe."
"CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Just go, Chris!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sherry's pregnant."
"LORELAI: Oh. Oh my."
"CHRISTOPHER: She just found out and she called me as soon as she found out, and that was her calling to tell me that she found out."
"LORELAI: Pregnant."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Wow. Well, uh, women all over the world will line up to see that tiny woman fat."
"CHRISTOPHER: I don't know what to do. I was so happy last night and now. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"CHRISTOPHER: I missed it before with Rory. I wasn't there, I wasn't apart of it."
"LORELAI: I know."
"CHRISTOPHER: And I never forgave myself."
"LORELAI: I know."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, what, I'm just. . .I'm gonna do that again? I'm just gonna take off, disappear?"
"LORELAI: No. You're gonna go home."
"CHRISTOPHER: This is absolutely unbelievable. I've waited years for this, Lor. You, Rory, the whole perfect picture and now - ."
"LORELAI: Listen, I have to walk down the aisle in a minute and be really happy for Sookie and right now I'm having a little trouble standing, so maybe it would be better if you would just go."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm so sorry."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. Me, too."
"CHRISTOPHER: You'll tell Rory?"
"LORELAI: I will. Hey, congratulations."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thanks."
"CUT TO WEDDING"
"[The wedding ceremony is about to begin. Lorelai is waiting to walk down the aisle. Rory runs over and stands next to her, Lorelai gives her a bouquet.]"
"RORY: I think I'm going to Washington."
"LORELAI: Oh. Okay."
"THE END"
