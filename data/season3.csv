"OPEN IN LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is asleep in bed when her alarm goes off. She shuts it off, and a second later, several others start going off around her bedroom.]"
"LORELAI: You are hilarious!"
"[She gets up and walks down to the kitchen, where Luke is at the stove making breakfast]"
"LORELAI: Okay, see, last night, when I said to you, Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I get up at seven,' what I actually meant was, Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I have the option of getting up at seven in case when seven comes, I actually wanna get up,' which  as it happened  I didn't. Therefore, you're currently responsible for the great alarm clock slaughter of 2002."
"[She pulls a container of coffee out of the freezer]"
"LUKE: No survivors?"
"LORELAI: The one shaped like a bunny escaped with a mild decapitation. [smells the coffee] This is decaf."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: You switched my coffee again."
"[Lorelai searches the kitchen for the regular coffee]"
"LUKE: I'm a busy man. I don't have time to sneak around switching your coffee. I have a diner to run, I have shipments to order, I have things to flip and fry. Will you stop that?"
"[Lorelai finds the bag of regular coffee under the sink]"
"LORELAI: Ha, haha, hahaha! Under the sink, very clever, but not clever enough bucko."
"LUKE: Okay, fine, you know what? I give up."
"LORELAI: Woo hoo!"
"LUKE: Go one day without coffee."
"LORELAI: That's not giving up."
"LUKE: I'll put a toy in your cereal."
"LORELAI: Dirty!"
"LUKE: [hands her a plate of food] Fine, here, you win."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: You're welcome. Now you're up, you're fed, I'm leaving."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, we need q-tips."
"LUKE: I'll alert the media."
"LORELAI: See, that's better with the accent."
"LUKE: The reference is enough, you'll learn that one day. I'll be home early, anything besides the q-tips?"
"LORELAI: Um, cotton balls, world peace, Connie Chung's original face back."
"[Luke kisses her]"
"LUKE: Goodbye crazy lady. [to Lorelai's stomach] Goodbye Sid and Nancy."
"LORELAI: Leopold and Loeb."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: I changed my mind, don't tell Rory."
"LUKE: Decaf."
"LORELAI: Never."
"LUKE: They'll both have two heads."
"LORELAI: More to love."
"[They kiss again and Luke walks out the back door]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[In the middle of the night, Lorelai wakes up suddenly from her dream. She falls out of the bed reaching for the phone]"
"LORELAI: Whoa! Ugh!"
"[She calls Rory at her dorm in Washington]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: You have to come home."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: You're gone and the house is quiet and Bill Maher's canceled. The name of the show was Politically Incorrect for God's sake. Didn't anybody read the title? He was supposed to say those things, dammit!"
"RORY: You had another dream."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: The doctor is in."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm lying in bed and I'm sleeping and I'm wearing this fabulous nightgown, and like thirty alarm clocks go off, and so I get out of bed and I walk downstairs, and there, standing is the kitchen, is Luke!"
"RORY: Was he naked?"
"LORELAI: No! He was making breakfast."
"RORY: Naked?"
"LORELAI: Okay, you've been in Washington way too long."
"RORY: Sorry. Go ahead, he was making breakfast. . ."
"LORELAI: Eggs and pancakes and bacon, and he put decaf coffee in my regular coffee bag, which of course I knew immediately."
"RORY: Hi, the nose."
"LORELAI: Exactly. So eventually I find the real stuff under the sink. He hands me my breakfast, and then . . ."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: He kissed me and talked to my stomach!"
"RORY: Why would he do that?"
"LORELAI: Because apparently I'm pregnant!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: With twins! [pause] Say something."
"RORY: You are going to be so fat."
"LORELAI: Just analyze my dream, please."
"RORY: Okay. Well, your dream was telling you that you are secretly in love with Luke and you wanna marry him and have his twins."
"LORELAI: Uh, no, try again."
"RORY: What do you mean, try again? You asked me to analyze your dream, I analyzed your dream."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I reject that analysis, so I'd like another one, please."
"RORY: You can't just reject an analysis and try again. You're not shopping for bathing suits here."
"LORELAI: Give me another analysis or I'll put your Taylor hula-hooping dream into a whole other context."
"RORY: I told you, Taylor was supposed to be Dean. I could tell by his freakishly thick head of hair."
"LORELAI: I'm waiting."
"RORY: Okay, maybe you're still upset about what happened with Dad and you're jealous of Sherry because she's having his baby and not you. Mom?"
"LORELAI: I miss you."
"RORY: I miss you, too."
"PARIS: [sleeptalking in background] Woodward. . .Bernstein. . .Harry Thomason."
"LORELAI: Is that Paris?"
"RORY: Yeah, she talks in her sleep. . . long in-depth arguments. I'm so glad I only have one more day here."
"LORELAI: Me, too. What do you have on your agenda for tomorrow? Or, today, actually."
"RORY: We have a breakfast mixer with members of Congress and the Senate."
"LORELAI: Cool. See if you can steal me something off of Tom Daschle's fruit plate."
"RORY: I'll see what I can do."
"LORELAI: See you Friday, doc."
"RORY: See you Friday."
"[Rory walks to her desk and sits down, where she tries to work on a letter to Jess]"
"PARIS: [sleeptalking] I did not have sexual relations with that woman."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the kitchen table]"
"LORELAI: No way."
"SOOKIE: I swear."
"LORELAI: Huh, Kosher bacon."
"SOOKIE: Beef not pork."
"LORELAI: I am so Jewish."
"JACKSON: [from other room] Hey Sookie, where's my "
"SOOKIE: Jackson, hold on! Lorelai's here!"
"LORELAI: [covers eyes] Oh, Jackson, I'm in the kitchen! I'm eating bacon, so don't . . aye - eh - da - ahhh!"
"JACKSON: [walks into kitchen] Will you stop it? I'm dressed."
"LORELAI: Uh, well, how do I know you weren't showering and the hot water went out and you rushed down here with nothing but a teeny tiny towel in front of ya."
"JACKSON: Once, that happened once."
"LORELAI: Well, once was enough."
"SOOKIE: Oh, hey, honey, I got those paint chips that we were talking about. Do you wanna look at them now?"
"JACKSON: Nope."
"SOOKIE: But it'll only take a minute and I actually went though and picked out a couple of colors for you."
"LORELAI: What are you painting?"
"JACKSON: Nothing."
"SOOKIE: The house."
"LORELAI: The whole house?"
"JACKSON: No."
"SOOKIE: Just the inside."
"LORELAI: Ah, that's a pretty big undertaking."
"JACKSON: It's not such a big undertaking since we're not undertaking it."
"SOOKIE: I know, but it'll be fun."
"LORELAI: Rory and I'll help if you want."
"JACKSON: Okay, if you're gonna come over here everyday, you have to actually hear both of us."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, tell me why you're not painting just the inside of the house?"
"SOOKIE: Because it was my house and now it's our house and I want it to feel like our house."
"JACKSON: I'm totally happy with the way this house feels."
"SOOKIE: How can you be? There's flowers everywhere."
"JACKSON: I like flowers  I'm a produce guy."
"SOOKIE: The curtains are ruffly."
"JACKSON: I like ruffles."
"SOOKIE: How can you like ruffles?"
"JACKSON: Because I'm very, very gay."
"SOOKIE: Jackson!"
"JACKSON: Judy, Vincent has to go to work now. Goodbye Lorelai. Tell her I'm fine, I like things just the way they are."
"LORELAI: I'll try."
"[Jackson leaves]"
"LORELAI: All right, I've only got a minute and then I have to leave. Is there any more bacon?"
"SOOKIE: Have mine. What do you think about mahogany for the living room and then midnight blue for the hallway and the bedroom?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson just said he's fine with how everything is. I don't think it's bugging him."
"SOOKIE: Well, he may not think so now but it'll bug him eventually and then he'll resent this place and me by extension and I would like to avoid that. And I can  I just need to butch the place up a little. Now, help me pick a color."
"LORELAI: Okay, I can't now, but I'll do it later."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Thanks for breakfast, it was amazing, I love you, I love the bacon. Oh, hey, bacon's manly. Why don't you just nail a bunch of packages of Kosher bacon on the walls, huh? Smells like meat blessed by a rabbi  now that's a manly house."
"SOOKIE: Buh-bye."
"LORELAI: Okay, but if you're still thinking paint, you're still thinking like a chick."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[The town square is being set up for a festival. Lorelai walks toward Taylor, who is in an electric wheelchair giving orders to people.]"
"TAYLOR: Watch those streamers! And not too much red near that tree  light touch, light touch, light touch."
"LORELAI: Hey Taylor, how's the leg?"
"TAYLOR: It's just fine."
"LORELAI: Still haven't found out who put that banana peel on your doorstep, huh?"
"TAYLOR: No, but I have a list of suspects."
"LORELAI: Hey, um, what's all this for?"
"TAYLOR: This, young lady, is for the first annual Stars Hollow End of Summer Madness Festival."
"LORELAI: You finally found a way to fill September, didn't ya?"
"TAYLOR: This is gonna be a very exciting day. I'm really gonna go all out for this. I even think you'll be impressed."
"LORELAI: Really, even me?"
"TAYLOR: Yes-sir-ee, mini-me, I did not put the word madness in the title for nothing. This place is gonna be crazy, wild  food, games, we've even got a band coming all the way from New York!"
"LORELAI: New York  that's just nuts!"
"TAYLOR: And wait til you see the banner I ordered. It's gonna make every other banner we've ever had look downright embarrassing."
"LORELAI: Taylor, you're on fire."
"TAYLOR: Oh, I love this banner!"
"LORELAI: I can't wait to see it."
"TAYLOR: Well, come on Friday. [to girl walking by] Uh, excuse me, uh, young lady. . .young lady? You know I'm talking to you. The blonde woman with the ribbons, please slow down. I'm in a wheelchair, young lady, I can't run after you."
"[As Taylor follows the girl off camera, Lorelai stares into Luke's Diner then sadly walks away]"
"CUT TO WASHINGTON"
"[At the Junior Leadership breakfast, Paris is talking with Senator Barbara Boxer]"
"PARIS: I mean, come on, Senator Boxer, as one of our foremost Democratic leaders, I ask you  do you really think it looks good to have the American Secretary of the Treasury traveling around with Bono? I mean, I know apparently he's a saint, he's going to save the world, yada, yada, yada, but my God! He never even takes the sunglasses off. We have an image to maintain, don't we? I mean, aren't we at least trying to pretend we're the superpower in this world? I mean, why not just send Carson Daly over to the Middle East next time Cheney goes, huh? Or hey, hook up Freddie Prinze Jr. with Colin Powell next time he meets with NATO. I mean, hell! Let's hear what Freddie has to say, right?"
"[A man walks by and the Senator grabs his arm]"
"SENATOR BOXER: Oh, great, Doug. Uh, Paris, do you know Republican Congressman Doug Ose from California? You don't? Great. You two will have so much to talk about. Bye. [walks away]"
"CONGRESSMAN OSE: Uh, Barbara"
"PARIS: Ose, right?"
"CONGRESSMAN OSE: Yes that's right."
"PARIS: Let's take a walk."
"[cut to Rory at one of the food tables. As she gets herself some coffee, a boy walks up to her]"
"JAMIE: Last day here."
"RORY: Yup."
"JAMIE: So, in your opinion, how was our nation's capital?"
"RORY: Well, I got to see Archie Bunker's chair at the Smithsonian Museum, so it was a big thumbs up for me."
"JAMIE: Yes, there are times when this country's priorities are exactly right. So, where's Paris?"
"RORY: Hm, not quite sure. Last time I saw her, she was b*at the will to live out of our nation's representatives."
"JAMIE: She is a hammer, isn't she?"
"RORY: Actually, she's the entire toolbox."
"[Paris walks up to them]"
"PARIS: Damn. I always seem to catch the most interesting politicians right when they have to use the bathroom. Hey Jamie."
"[Paris walks over to another table and Jamie follows her]"
"JAMIE: Paris. Just came over to let you know I got a little sneak peak at the final debate pairings for today. It seems like you and I are going to be on the same side this time."
"PARIS: You're kidding? You'd think they'd like to give someone else a fighting chance for once."
"JAMIE: Apparently not."
"PARIS: God, I love this. You don't realize how unqualified most of America's youth is until you gather them all up in a room and make them speak. So, who are we up against?"
"JAMIE: Jason Roundsevault and Ty Fredericks."
"PARIS: Perfect. Jason's got asthma and Ty cries."
"JAMIE: Okay, so we should meet early and go over strategy, make sure you bought enough Kleenex."
"PARIS: Good, good."
"JAMIE: And then tonight we should get together and celebrate over dinner."
"PARIS: What if we don't win?"
"JAMIE: Don't lose it on me now."
"PARIS: You're right."
"JAMIE: So, dinner?"
"PARIS: Sure."
"JAMIE: Good, I'll swing around for you about seven."
"PARIS: Fine."
"JAMIE: Okay, see you at the slaughter."
"[Jamie walks away and Rory walks over to Paris]"
"RORY: Wow!"
"PARIS: Yeah, can you imagine pairing me with Jamie? I mean, why not just line the hallways with self esteem counselors right now."
"RORY: Paris?"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: What do you mean what? He just asked you out on a date."
"PARIS: He did not."
"RORY: Yes, he did. You're having dinner with Jamie tonight."
"PARIS: It's a victory dinner, that's it."
"RORY: Paris, if he just wanted to celebrate winning a debate, you guys could've had coffee afterward, but he asked you out on a date."
"PARIS: He did?"
"RORY: Yes."
"PARIS: Did I accept?"
"RORY: Yes."
"PARIS: I'm going on a date?"
"RORY: Yes, you are."
"PARIS: Oh man, I can't believe this! I finally get asked out on a date and I missed it? Was it a good ask-out?"
"RORY: It was a very good ask-out."
"PARIS: God, I wish I'd been there."
"RORY: Well, you'll be there tonight."
"PARIS: Tonight? Tonight I have a date. Tonight I have a date with Jamie  a Princeton man. I can overlook that. Oh my God, I can't believe it. . .I have a date."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel is at the front desk talking to Kirk]"
"KIRK: One day it occurred to me, cows never wrinkle."
"MICHEL: Mmhmm."
"KIRK: Think about it  have you ever seen a wrinkled cow? No, not once. So I thought to myself, ""That is weird."""
"MICHEL: Yes, that and other things."
"KIRK: So I decided to do a little research. I studied cows, I studied humans, and finally I discovered the secret  the secret of the cows."
"LORELAI: [walking up to them] Michel, could you, uh. . .hi Kirk."
"MICHEL: Oh, good, just in time. Kirk here is about to tell us the difference between cows and humans."
"LORELAI: You mean, other than one's a cow?"
"MICHEL: Shh. Go ahead, Kirk."
"KIRK: Hay."
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"KIRK: Hay, it's hay  cows eat hay. And after some experimentation and a great deal of research, I developed what I believe to be the next great skin care product to sweep the nation. [shows them a bottle]"
"LORELAI: [reads the label] Hay There."
"KIRK: A complete line of creams, balms, toning lotions, and cleansing liquids."
"LORELAI: Kirk, we already have a skin care line here, I'm sorry."
"KIRK: I am willing to give you three cases of ""Hay There"" skin products absolutely free of charge. Try them, you will see what I'm talking about."
"LORELAI: Well, uh, thank you very much, Kirk. . . but, I'm sorry  don't cows eat grass?"
"KIRK: Sometimes, but ""Grass There"" is a bad name. [leaves]"
"MICHEL: So sad not to have a cocktail in your hand every time he comes by, no?"
"[the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"EMILY: What day is this?"
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"EMILY: What day is this?"
"LORELAI: Mom, I have a group of "
"EMILY: It's Thursday."
"LORELAI: Thank God. Now, could I possibly "
"EMILY: Thursday the what, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: It's "
"EMILY: Thursday the third. And what was happening Thursday the third, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: I believe it was the day I was supposed to chew my own head off."
"EMILY: Your father and I were coming home from Martha's Vineyard."
"LORELAI: I know you were."
"EMILY: And you said that when we got home, you were going to call us."
"LORELAI: I know I did."
"EMILY: Well, we're home, and yet there's no call, no message, no card."
"LORELAI: Mom, it's eleven o'clock in the morning. I said I would call you on Thursday, I didn't say when on Thursday, I just said Thursday. Technically I haven't screwed up for another twelve hours."
"EMILY: Lorelai, everyone knows that you are supposed to call people as soon as they have arrived home. That's the polite way to do it."
"LORELAI: You didn't tell me what time you were coming home."
"EMILY: Well, you never asked what time we were coming home."
"LORELAI: Yes, but you never told me so there's no way I could know, so even though I didn't ask I still didn't know and it's only elev. . .I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Apology accepted. Now I assume we'll be seeing you and Rory for dinner tomorrow?"
"LORELAI: Uh, you'll see me but Rory doesn't get back til Saturday."
"EMILY: Oh, what a shame. I thought she was coming back tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Nope, she's coming back Saturday."
"EMILY: Well, I'm very disappointed. I had it written down for tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Well, you must've written it down wrong, Mom. She's coming home Saturday."
"EMILY: Your father thought it was tomorrow, also."
"LORELAI: See you at seven."
"EMILY: Hold a moment, Lorelai. Do you know where Christopher is?"
"LORELAI: Um, why?"
"EMILY: We wanted him to come with you and Rory tomorrow, even though apparently Rory's getting back Saturday, though I couldn't sworn it was tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Christopher's away on business but I'll tell him you invited him."
"EMILY: And tell him to come with you two next week. I wanna see the three of you together."
"LORELAI: Yes, that would be a nice picture."
"EMILY: All right, see you tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Yes, you will. Bye."
"CUT TO WASHINGTON DORM ROOM"
"[Rory is on the phone with Dean while Paris gets ready for her date]"
"RORY: My plane gets in at three."
"DEAN: I'm in at six."
"PARIS: Red, purple, green  where the hell is it?"
"RORY: That gives me three hours to look presentable. Hm, perhaps I'll go blonde."
"DEAN: I strongly request that you don't."
"RORY: Afraid of change?"
"DEAN: No, I just like what I have."
"RORY: I like a man who settles."
"DEAN: I miss you."
"RORY: I miss you, too."
"PARIS: Hey, hey, stop being cute. I need help here."
"RORY: I have to go. Paris is melting down."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: She has a date tonight."
"DEAN: Really?"
"PARIS: Don't sound so surprised."
"RORY: How do you know he sounded surprised?"
"PARIS: Because I'm a genius, Rory. I have deep and powerful clairvoyant abilities."
"RORY: Oh boy."
"PARIS: For example, I can instantly deduce that when someone hears the name Paris in the same sentence with the word date, jaws will drop, confused looks will cover faces, words like how' and why' and Quick, Bob, get the children in the minivan because the world is obviously coming to an end!' will immediately fly out of people's mouths."
"RORY: I have to go."
"DEAN: Are you sure it's safe?"
"RORY: I'll be fine. I'll see you Friday."
"DEAN: See you Friday. I love you."
"PARIS: That's it, I'm shaving my head."
"RORY: Gotta go. [hangs up] Okay, Paris, you have got to calm down."
"PARIS: I had a black sweater and now it's gone."
"RORY: I'm not just talking about right now  in general, you need to calm down."
"PARIS: He's almost here, I'm not dressed, my makeup's not done, and I haven't gone through the Zagat yet to pick out a restaurant."
"RORY: Why don't you just let him pick out the restaurant?"
"PARIS: What if he doesn't have a Zagat?"
"RORY: Well, then he'll wing it."
"PARIS: Wing it? How come other girls get planned out dinners? Flowers, candy, rose petals thrown on the floors  and I get wing it?"
"RORY: Well, you don't know that you've got wing it."
"PARIS: No, I do. I've got wing it. I can't do this."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Date. I can't date. I'm not genetically set up for it."
"RORY: Not true."
"PARIS: I get no pleasure out of the prospect or the preparation. I'm covered in hives, I've showered four times, and for what? Some guy who doesn't even have the brains to buy a Zagat so we don't wind up in a restaurant that's really just a front for a cocaine laundering ring?"
"RORY: Sit."
"PARIS: It's a dare. He was dared to take me out. I bet Trent Lott was behind this."
"RORY: Trent Lott did not dare Jamie to take you out. Close. Jamie likes you and he asked you out because he likes you. Now look up."
"PARIS: Maybe I shouldn't go. I mean, what if I fall for him and he doesn't like me?"
"RORY: Then you'll find someone else."
"PARIS: But what if there is no one else?"
"RORY: Then you'll buy some cats."
"PARIS: I wish I knew if he was right for me, you know? So I don't put myself through all of this for nothing. I mean, women fall for men who are wrong for them all of the time, and then they get sidetracked from their goals. They give up careers and become alcoholics and, if you're Sunny von Bülow, wind up in a coma completely incapable of stopping Glenn Close from playing you in a movie."
"RORY: I think you should wear your hair down."
"PARIS: How do you know if a guy is right for you?"
"RORY: You just have to feel it."
"PARIS: All I feel is my back breaking out."
"RORY: You'll know, okay? You just have to let it happen. And then, probably when you're not looking, you'll find someone who compliments you."
"PARIS: Meaning?"
"RORY: Someone who likes what you like, someone who reads the same books or listens to the same music or likes to trash the same movies. Someone compatible."
"PARIS: Okay."
"RORY: But not so compatible that they're boring."
"PARIS: Someone who's compatible but not compatible."
"RORY: Yeah, kind of. I mean, you respect each other's opinions and you can laugh at the same jokes, but I don't know  there's just something about not quite knowing what the other person's gonna do at all times that's just really exciting. Look, just have a good time, you'll figure it out."
"PARIS: Yeah, well, I hope I figure it out fast. . .before I throw up."
"[there's a knock at the door]"
"PARIS: That's him."
"RORY: Turn around."
"PARIS: Well?"
"RORY: Perfect."
"PARIS: Promise?"
"RORY: Swear."
"PARIS: Thanks. Now get in the closet."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: If he comes in here and sees you, he won't wanna date me anymore."
"RORY: Paris, that's crazy! He's seen me  he's seen me for weeks."
"PARIS: Yes, in conferences, crowded lecture halls, badly lit banquet rooms with crappy food smells, not at night when it's dating time and he's thinking about dating and you're standing there looking all datable."
"RORY: I'm not looking datable."
"PARIS: Please? I can't risk it. At least if there's nothing to compare me to, then I've got a fighting chance, please!"
"RORY: Okay, but when you get home, you need to get a new therapist because the one you have is really not working. [goes into the closet]"
"PARIS: Thanks for helping me get ready."
"RORY: [from inside closet] Any time."
"[Paris answers the door]"
"PARIS: Hi."
"JAMIE: Hello. You look very nice."
"PARIS: Well, this is a really good sweater."
"JAMIE: So, shall we get going?"
"PARIS: Oh, sure, sure."
"JAMIE: Do you like Italian food?"
"PARIS: I love Italian food."
"JAMIE: Good. I've made a reservation at a great place. Well, at least, that's what the Zagat guide says."
"PARIS: You're perfect."
"JAMIE: Let's go."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are browsing]"
"SOOKIE: How could you not tell them?"
"LORELAI: Well, they left two days after your wedding and they were in Martha's Vineyard all summer. It just seemed quieter."
"SOOKIE: What do you think, manly? [holds up a statue]"
"LORELAI: In an Oscar Wilde sort of way, absolutely."
"SOOKIE: You know, you're gonna have to tell them tonight, right? I mean, the subject will come up. They probably think you and Christopher are heading down the aisle any day now."
"LORELAI: Ugh, I know, I know."
"SOOKIE: A shaving table, it's perfect!"
"LORELAI: And twelve hundred dollars."
"SOOKIE: Twelve hundred dollars for what?"
"MRS. KIM: What do you mean, for what? This is an antique."
"SOOKIE: Where does she come from?"
"MRS. KIM: This was Sherman's shaving table."
"LORELAI: Sherman?"
"MRS. KIM: General Sherman, famous man, b*rned Atlanta, liked a close shave."
"LORELAI: Wow, historical."
"MRS. KIM: All original, perfect shape. I give you ten percent off, you want it?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, well, maybe. I just wanted to look around a little bit first. . .but it's very nice."
"MRS. KIM: I know it's very nice. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Boy, she would've made a great nun."
"SOOKIE: So how are you planning on telling them?"
"LORELAI: I thought I'd do it like Nell. You know, chicka chicka chickabee."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, that's a very good idea."
"LORELAI: I'll tell them, I promise."
"SOOKIE: Oh, oh my God, look! [walks over to a fish mounted on a piece of wood]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: For over the mantelpiece. It's perfect!"
"LORELAI: It's a dead fish."
"SOOKIE: It's an antique stuffed and mounted trout, and I think it's manly."
"LORELAI: Oh, please!"
"SOOKIE: It is! It's very Ralph Lauren."
"LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson loves you. You're not seriously telling me the future of your marriage depends on Leon Troutsky over there."
"SOOKIE: I guess not."
"LORELAI: Just think about it, okay? You don't have to make every decision right now. Do a little more shopping. Maybe you'll find something even more disgusting someplace else."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay, I gotta go pick up Rory at the airport, and then we'll swing by and pick up you guys for the festival."
"SOOKIE: Great."
"LORELAI: Okay, see you later."
"SOOKIE: Bye."
"[Lorelai walks toward the door and stops to talk to Mrs. Kim.]"
"LORELAI: Ten bucks if you don't let her buy the fish."
"MRS. KIM: Twenty."
"LORELAI: [laughs] You're kidding?"
"MRS. KIM: I never kid."
"LORELAI: You know, I believe that."
"CUT TO AIRPORT"
"[Rory walks out of her gate; Lorelai calls to her from across the room]"
"LORELAI: Hey Gilmore!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"[They run to each other and hug, then fall on the ground]"
"LORELAI: Ow, ow!"
"RORY: Ah!"
"LORELAI: Ow!"
"RORY: Ah!"
"LORELAI: Oh!"
"RORY: Agh!"
"LORELAI: Oh, oh! Luckily there are video cameras everywhere that caught that very graceful moment on tape."
"RORY: I am so glad to see you!"
"LORELAI: No, I'm glad to see you!"
"RORY: I'm never leaving home again."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's my emotionally stunted girl! Hey, I got you gifts."
"RORY: What? I'm the one that left town, I'm supposed to get you gifts."
"LORELAI: Oh, but I got here early and there was nothing to do except feed gummy bears to the b*mb dogs which, apparently, the United States government frowns upon."
"RORY: You got in trouble with the government while you were waiting for me?"
"LORELAI: Just a little."
"RORY: How much is a little?"
"LORELAI: Learn Russian. Okay, here you go. [pulls a shirt out of the gift bag]"
"RORY: Wow, a Hartford, Connecticut sweatshirt."
"LORELAI: Nice, huh?"
"RORY: [looks through the gift bags] Hartford, Connecticut notebook, Hartford, Connecticut pencil set, a Hartford, Connecticut sh*t glass."
"LORELAI: And beer mug!"
"RORY: Hartford baguette, Hartford bear, a Hartford sunglasses."
"LORELAI: You like?"
"RORY: I love."
"LORELAI: All right, let's go. We'll get your bags, then we'll hit the road, and I can't wait to hear all about Washington. And, by the way, I got you out of dinner with the Gilmores tonight. I thought you and Dean might enjoy a little Peaches and Herb time together."
"RORY: Oh, thanks. What'd you tell them?"
"LORELAI: That you get home tomorrow."
"RORY: Big fat lie."
"LORELAI: Yes, which proves how much I love you. The fact that I was willing to lie to my own parents who I never lie to just so you could have a night of happiness is proof positive of my deep undying devotion that I have for you."
"RORY: I appreciate that."
"LORELAI: And all that devotion can be yours for the low, low price of $29.95!"
"RORY: Forget it."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll throw in a set of steak knives."
"RORY: My bags, please?"
"LORELAI: Are you telling me that you want this gesture of love for free? What kind of world are you living in?"

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door with Rory's bags]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, you do know one option was leaving some of your books at home?"
"RORY: Hey, I offered to carry that one."
"LORELAI: Next time, don't offer  insist. Look, I'm lopsided now."
"RORY: I can't believe I'm home. I feel like I've been away forever."
"LORELAI: I agree."
"RORY: Hello living room."
"LORELAI: Hello Rory, we missed you. Not the ottoman, of course, but everyone knows he's a snob. Napoleon complex, he only really likes the magazine rack."
"RORY: Oh my God, I missed everything. My kitchen, my room, my books, my CDs, my stuff. Where's my pillow?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: You took my pillow."
"LORELAI: I did not take your pillow."
"RORY: You waited until I left, you went into my room, and you took my pillow."
"LORELAI: Well, you weren't using it."
"RORY: What else did you take?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. Your comforter came into my room by itself. . .and brought your Bauhaus T-shirt with it."
"RORY: I want my stuff back by tomorrow morning."
"LORELAI: Just cause you leave doesn't mean the world stops."
"RORY: By noon."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"[Lorelai pushes the play button on the answering machine]"
"CHRISTOPHER: [on machine] Lor, it's me, please just call "
"[Lorelai deletes the message]"
"RORY: Dad?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Still haven't talked to him yet, huh?"
"LORELAI: No, you?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: He's called."
"RORY: I know. He's called me, too."
"LORELAI: I just. . .I don't really know what to say."
"RORY: How long are you gonna freeze him out for?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: You?"
"RORY: I don't know either."
"LORELAI: I have to tell my parents tonight."
"RORY: Are you sure you don't want me to go with you and . . . I don't know, distract them?"
"LORELAI: No, you've got Dean coming over. I'll be fine. I'll bring them something shiny."
"RORY: Okay, I'm gonna go change then."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RORY: The festival."
"LORELAI: Hon, you know what, if you don't wanna go, we don't have to go."
"RORY: Why would I not wanna go? Of course I wanna go."
"LORELAI: You just got home, you've got Dean coming over."
"RORY: No, I wanna go. I wanna go because this is our town and we need to support these things."
"LORELAI: All right, but. . .you don't have to change for that."
"RORY: Well, I've been away for awhile, I wanna make a nice impression."
"LORELAI: On who?"
"RORY: Whoever has to look at me."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: All right, just hustle. I promised Jackson and Sookie I'd pick them up along the way."
"RORY: I'll just be a minute."
"LORELAI: No woman is ever a minute when she changes."
"RORY: Do not judge me by your own standards. [pulls out a dress]"
"LORELAI: Wow, fancy."
"RORY: Not fancy."
"LORELAI: You know, you'll have time to come home and change for Dean."
"RORY: Well, I can just change now, then I won't have to do it later."
"LORELAI: Okay. Hey Rory, I don't want you to freeze out your dad because I am."
"RORY: I'm not."
"LORELAI: Cause I'm fine if you wanna go back to the way things were."
"RORY: I think that would be a little hard this time."
"LORELAI: Okay, maybe not now, but eventually."
"RORY: Eventually, maybe, but for now  solidarity sister."
"LORELAI: Ya ya!"
"RORY: You've been waiting for six weeks to do that, haven't you?"
"LORELAI: Ya ya!"
"RORY: I'll just be a minute."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of some bushes near Sookie and Jackson's house]"
"LORELAI: See, three minutes faster. I also found a way to get to Al's Pancake World that shaves a good forty seconds off our normal route."
"RORY: You were really bored when I was gone, weren't you?"
"LORELAI: You have no idea."
"[As they walk up Sookie and Jackson's front steps, they hear yelling from inside]"
"JACKSON: Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?"
"SOOKIE: I don't understand why you're so upset."
"JACKSON: How can you not understand? I told you a thousand times."
"SOOKIE: I thought you were just being nice."
"[Lorelai and Rory peek through the front door. Sookie has redecorated the living room and filled it with masculine objects]"
"JACKSON: Nice! Sookie, look at this place!"
"SOOKIE: I think it looks nice."
"JACKSON: Nice. . .nice? This is nice. . .this is nice? [points to a life-sized stuffed grizzly bear]"
"SOOKIE: Well, it's masculine!"
"JACKSON: No, it's terrifying! I swear I'm gonna come out in the middle of the night for a drink of water, turn around, hit the floor and play dead!"
"SOOKIE: Okay, so, we have a little work to do."
"JACKSON: Just put it back the way it was."
"SOOKIE: No, I want you to be happy!"
"JACKSON: I was happy, I told you I was happy, you just didn't wanna believe I was happy!"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk away from the house and walk toward the festival]"
"LORELAI: We'll just check on them a little later."
"RORY: Excellent idea."
"[they walk into the crowd]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so, do we do cheese stick, hot dog, cotton candy, or do we mix it up a little  start with the cotton candy and end with the cheese stick? Who are you looking for?"
"RORY: No one, I'm just taking in all the madness, that's all."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"[Kirk walks up to them]"
"KIRK: Lorelai, good. Have you used the cream yet?"
"LORELAI: Uh, not yet, Kirk."
"KIRK: Good, there's been a little problem."
"LORELAI: What kind of problem?"
"KIRK: Nothing of major concern. It just seems that with continual use, the cream develops some weird reactions to light. . .and air. . .and movement."
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"KIRK: Don't worry, it's just a small kink. It'll all be worked out soon."
"LORELAI: I have three cases of that stuff sitting at the inn."
"KIRK: Well, get rid of it."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: Uh, but don't throw it in the trash. Apparently, that would be an EPA violation."
"LORELAI: What am I supposed to do with the stuff?"
"KIRK: sh**ting it into space is about all I've got now."
"LORELAI: Kirk!"
"KIRK: I'll pick up the cases tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Kirk walks away]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Do you sometimes think this town is weird or is it just me?"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to Taylor]"
"LORELAI: Hey Taylor, is this where the mosh pit starts?"
"TAYLOR: Well, hello Lorelai, Rory. So what do you think of the band? Pretty big city, don't you think?"
"LORELAI: Mm, I sure do."
"TAYLOR: What?"
"LORELAI: What? I'm agreeing with you. They are smokin'!"
"TAYLOR: I do not care for that sarcastic tone, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well. . .uh. . .no, I'm being nice here!"
"TAYLOR: You have an opinion on everything. Nothing is ever up to your standards."
"LORELAI: That is not true. I'm sure these guys are all great barbers."
"TAYLOR: I don't even know why I bother. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: That is it  I have been it for the last. . .[sees Rory staring off at something] What? [sees Jess and a girl kissing against a tree] Oh, well, looks like he's got his what I did this summer' essay all researched and ready to go. Guess you dodged a b*llet there, huh?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It seems kind of lucky that you didn't throw everything away for Jess when you see. . ."
"RORY: See what? What am I seeing?"
"LORELAI: You're upset."
"RORY: No, I'm not upset."
"LORELAI: Yes, you are upset. I know when you're upset cause you look like my mother."
"RORY: Thanks a lot."
"LORELAI: You like my mother."
"RORY: Yes, but you don't like your mother, so when you tell me that I look like your mother, it's not exactly a compliment."
"LORELAI: Honey, what is wrong?"
"RORY: Oh God!"
"LORELAI: What is it?"
"RORY: It's that!"
"LORELAI: Jess?"
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: You're upset about Jess?"
"RORY: I said yes."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's Jess?"
"RORY: You're not being funny."
"LORELAI: It's not my fault that yes and Jess rhyme. Did I exploit the opportunity, of course I did, but . . .Rory, come on. I know you had this crush "
"RORY: It wasn't a crush."
"LORELAI: Well, I thought it was over. I mean, you haven't talked to him since "
"RORY: Sookie's wedding."
"LORELAI: You talked to him at Sookie's wedding?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: He wasn't at Sookie's wedding."
"RORY: Yes, he was. He had just come back and he came to see me."
"LORELAI: Okay, so he crashed Sookie's wedding, and. . ."
"RORY: And nothing. He told me that he was back in town, that he'd moved back, and. . ."
"LORELAI: What Rory? Come on."
"RORY: And we kissed, okay?"
"LORELAI: You kissed?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: You kissed, like. . .you kissed?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Okay, who kissed who?"
"RORY: What does that matter?"
"LORELAI: Because it matters. Did he kiss you, did you kiss each other, did you trip and your faces accidentally  ."
"RORY: I kissed him."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: And I don't know, I thought he came back here because he liked me or something, and I kissed him and he kissed me back, and now he's over there and I feel so stupid and. . .that girl isn't even his type and -"
"LORELAI: Rory, what are you doing?"
"RORY: What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm ranting. You should recognize this, I learned it from you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but you went to Sookie's wedding with. . .with Dean."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: And then you ran off to have some thing with Jess."
"RORY: It was a kiss, not a thing."
"LORELAI: A kiss is a thing."
"RORY: Well, it wasn't planned, it just happened."
"LORELAI: I can't believe it. All this time I'm thinking, She's with Dean.'"
"RORY: I am with Dean."
"LORELAI: No, Rory  kissing another guy is not being with Dean. Ask him, I bet he'd back me up on that."
"RORY: It was nothing."
"LORELAI: Well, then why are you so freaked out?"
"RORY: I'm not freaked out."
"LORELAI: Look, kid, you have gotta make up your mind. Jess, Dean, Jess, Dean  it's enough already. If you want Jess, that's fine  go get him, there he is. If you think that's the great love of your life, then great. . .grab a liver treat and a squeaky toy and run to him. Don't worry about that girl because I'm sure he will have moved onto somebody else in about an hour. But do something. Dean has been sweet and supportive and incredibly patient, and now you are officially treating him like dirt, and I'm sorry, but not only is that not you, he doesn't deserve that. God, I wish they knew another song!"
"RORY: I know all of this about Dean."
"LORELAI: You do?"
"RORY: Yes, I do. I know how great he is. I knew it before you did!"
"LORELAI: Well, knowing this has apparently not stopped you from dragging his heart all over this town."
"RORY: Not fair!"
"LORELAI: Yes, fair, the fairest, the Snow White of fair."
"RORY: I don't wanna talk to you about this anymore."
"LORELAI: Okay, listen, if you don't wanna be with Dean anymore, cut him loose. Let him find someone who does because this is just so. . .wrong!"
"RORY: All right, I get it, I . . .just stop!"
"DEAN: [calls from across the street] Rory! [walks over to them] Hey."
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi Dean."
"RORY: I thought your plane didn't get in til six."
"DEAN: Well, I managed to get an earlier flight."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm off to dinner with the parents."
"DEAN: Do you have "
"LORELAI: No, she's off the hook. You guys have all night to. . .talk. Enjoy. Good to have you back, Dean."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"LORELAI: See you later. [leaves]"
"DEAN: So, did I interrupt something?"
"RORY: No, nothing. Uh, we were just. . .hi, you're back."
"DEAN: Yeah, I'm back  and I'm glad to find you not blonde."
"RORY: Yeah, I was just having way too much fun, so . . ."
"DEAN: I missed you."
"RORY: I missed you, too."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings; Emily answers the door]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, nice to see you."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry I'm late, Mom."
"EMILY: No, don't be sorry. That's what the warm setting was invented for. Richard, Lorelai's here!"
"LORELAI: Um, Mom, before we get the evening started and all, I wanna tell you something."
"EMILY: Well, tell me outside."
"LORELAI: No, I'll just do it here."
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Oh, there's just something about standing near the exit that's really working for me."
"EMILY: You're being silly, you don't discuss things standing by a door. Come outside, come on."
"RICHARD: I may have to take one more call tonight, Emily. Ben Stellen and I got cut off. Hello Lorelai."
"EMILY: Well, come outside with us until he calls back. Lorelai's about to tell us something."
"RICHARD: Oh, perhaps that she's decided to buy an accurate timepiece."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard. [they start walking to the back patio] Is Rory okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, Rory's fine, I'm fine, everything's fine, it's really not that big a deal."
"RICHARD: What would you like to drink?"
"LORELAI: Oh, whatever."
"RICHARD: I can't read minds, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I really don't care, Dad. Whatever you have."
"RICHARD: We have everything, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Al right, I'll have a Yaegermeister and a Jell-O sh*t."
"RICHARD: Uh, excuse me?"
"LORELAI: White wine."
"EMILY: All right, sit, sit. [they sit down] Now go ahead, tell us."
"LORELAI: Okay, well "
"EMILY: Oh, wait just a second. We brought you something from Martha's Vineyard."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's great, but maybe we could just do. . . [Emily hands her a gift bag]. . .okay, I guess it's present time."
"EMILY: Open it."
"[pulls something out of the bag]"
"LORELAI: Scone mix, wow."
"EMILY: This new little place opened right down the road from our house and they make these wonderful scones, and that is their mix so you can make them right in your own kitchen."
"LORELAI: Well, thanks, Mom. I will put this right on the counter and stare at it for many years to come."
"EMILY: You're not going to make them?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm not really much of a baker."
"EMILY: But the instructions are right there on the back."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but still."
"EMILY: Still what? Those are good scones."
"LORELAI: Hey, maybe I'll give this to Sookie and she'll bake them."
"EMILY: I don't understand why you simply can't follow those directions and make the scones."
"RICHARD: Rory would love those scones."
"LORELAI: Okay, I promise one way or another, the scones will get eaten. That being said, can we please move on?"
"EMILY: Fine, go ahead, talk, we're listening."
"LORELAI: Um, okay, well, um, it's about Christopher."
"EMILY: Oh, that reminds me, we got him a captain's hat. Richard, where is that hat? Lorelai can bring it to him."
"LORELAI: No, I can't!"
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's just, um. . .Chris and I aren't . . ."
"RICHARD: Aren't what?"
"EMILY: They aren't together anymore, Richard."
"RICHARD: Why not?"
"EMILY: I'm sure a vague reason is forthcoming."
"LORELAI: It just didn't work out, that's all."
"EMILY: And there it is."
"LORELAI: I know you're disappointed."
"EMILY: Disappointed, oh please! Lorelai, this is ridiculous. The two of you aren't in high school anymore."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RICHARD: Emily, let's not talk about this."
"EMILY: No, we are going to talk about it. You're running around like you have no responsibility in life, like you can flit from thing to thing. . ."
"LORELAI: That's not true."
"EMILY:. . .from man to man."
"LORELAI: I don't flit from man to man."
"EMILY: You have a daughter, this affects Rory too, you know!"
"RICHARD: Emily, you're wasting your breath."
"LORELAI: I know this affects Rory. I'm not doing this lightly. In fact, I'm not doing anything at all."
"RICHARD: There's no reason to raise your voice."
"LORELAI: I can't believe this."
"EMILY: I wanna know why. I want a reason. I don't want any of this just because' and it just didn't work out' nonsense. I want a solid, adult reason why the father of my granddaughter and her mother can't seem to put a family together."
"LORELAI: His girlfriend is pregnant."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Sherry is pregnant, and when Christopher found out, he went back to her and that, Mother, is the reason."
"EMILY: Are they getting married?"
"LORELAI: I don't know  probably."
"RICHARD: Oh, of course they're getting married."
"EMILY: How do you know?"
"RICHARD: I know because I know Christopher, and Christopher always tries to do the right thing."
"EMILY: The right thing is for him to be with his family. Lorelai and Rory are his family. He met this woman two minutes ago."
"RICHARD: Emily, he is going to be a father."
"EMILY: He already is a father!"
"LORELAI: I really really don't wanna discuss this anymore."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you have to talk to him."
"LORELAI: There's nothing to talk about."
"EMILY: Tell him you wanna get married."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom, please stop."
"RICHARD: Yes, Emily, please stop. You know that Lorelai never does anything unless she wants to  no matter the consequences to anyone else."
"LORELAI: What's that supposed to mean?"
"EMILY: Lorelai wants to be with Christopher, she told us that at the wedding."
"RICHARD: Yes, and now the wind has changed."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RICHARD: Christopher is living up to his responsibilities as he tried to do many years ago with Lorelai, then she turned him down and turned him away."
"LORELAI: I was sixteen."
"RICHARD: If Christopher has found someone who will actually allow him to be a father to his own child, then of course, that's what he's going to do."
"EMILY: So you support this?"
"RICHARD: I understand this."
"EMILY: I am appalled by your attitude."
"RICHARD: And I am shocked by your naïveté. Did you really expect this to work out? Did you really have pictures of Norman Rockwell family Christmases dancing in your head? Lorelai had her chance for a family, she walked away from it. That was her choice. He has a chance to be a father. I applaud him."
"EMILY: Then you're an idiot."
"RICHARD: If you'll excuse me, I'm going into my study."
"EMILY: Richard! You do not walk out on me when we are having a discussion. Richard!"
"[While Emily and Richard are arguing, Lorelai walks into the house and leaves through the front door]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai pulls up in the town square. She looks around, then walks into Luke's Diner. Luke is standing at the cash register.]"
"LUKE: We're closed."
"LORELAI: I know. Look, I didn't come here to make up, or to try to get you to forgive me, or talk. I wouldn't even have come here at all but I had a really crappy night and I really, really need a cup of coffee. Just pretend I'm not me. I'm Mimi, a new customer. I've never been in here before. I was just walking down the street and I spotted this place. Ooh, hey, nice place.' And I came in. Now Mimi is going to pour herself a cup of coffee and sit over here way far away from you, and she promises, just as soon as she's done, she will rinse out her own cup and leave."
"[Lorelai pours herself a cup of coffee and sits at the end of the counter.]"
"LORELAI: This is the second time I let myself do this."
"LUKE: Do what?"
"LORELAI: Think I finally found it."
"LUKE: Found what?"
"LORELAI: Love, comfort, safety."
"LUKE: Ah."
"LORELAI: I mean, first with Max, which of course, I screwed up, and then with Christopher, which of course, all the elements of the universe got together to screw up."
"LUKE: Yup, it's tough when the universe is against you. That's like taking on the Manhattan garbage union."
"LORELAI: I always thought if he could just get it together, grow up  maybe we could do it. Maybe we could really be a family, in the stupid, traditional Dan Quayle, golden retriever, grow old together, wear matching jogging suits' kind of way. And then he did get it together  he became that guy. . . and he gets to be that guy with her. Chris is gonna have a baby with his girlfriend. He's gonna marry her. . .and he's gonna be there for her while she's pregnant and he's gonna be there with her while her child grows up, and he's gonna be there for her while she does. . . whatever it is she does. And I am in exactly the same place that I was in before."
"LUKE: Is that so bad? I mean, you got Rory."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do."
"LUKE: You got friends, you got a house, a job, apparently an iron stomach."
"LORELAI: No, it's not so bad. I'm lucky, I know. I just. . .I feel like I'm never gonna have it. . .the whole package, you know? That person, that couple life, and I swear, I hate admitting it because I fancy myself Wonder Woman, but. . .I really want it  the whole package."
"[Luke puts a donut on a plate, then slides it down the counter to her]"
"LUKE: You'll get it."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"LUKE: Because I know, okay? I know. Now eat your donut."
"LORELAI: I'm really not very hungry."
"LUKE: Well, take it with you. You will be later."
"[Lorelai wraps up the donut and puts it in her purse, then pulls out some money]"
"LUKE: Forget it, first time customers are on the house. Mimi, was it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: Come again, Mimi."
"LORELAI: Thanks, I will. Seems like a very nice place."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is in the living room as Lorelai walks into the house]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you're home."
"RORY: Yup, I'm home."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, I figured how to get the Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer out of our heads  to sing the Small World song over and over for the next forty-eight hours. Of course, how we get the Small World song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet. Okay, see, that was not how that whole scene between us was supposed to go."
"RORY: No?"
"[They sit down on the couch]"
"LORELAI: No. I mean, yes, I was surprised and I do think the basic sentiment of make up your mind' was kind of called for."
"RORY: Absolutely called for."
"LORELAI: But I didn't mean to upset you and yell at you and make you feel bad, I'm really sorry, hon."
"RORY: I know, but you were right."
"LORELAI: Ah, well, that's once, I guess."
"RORY: So how was dinner?"
"LORELAI: So how was Dean?"
"RORY: So how was dinner?"
"LORELAI: So how was Dean?"
"RORY: Ladies and Gentlemen, the Williams' sisters take center stage at Wimbledon once again."
"LORELAI: Dinner was bad."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: That's okay, I knew it would be. Oh, but the good news is we can now go back to Luke's."
"RORY: You made up! How did you make up?"
"LORELAI: Well, I'm Mimi now."
"RORY: Oh, sure."
"LORELAI: So speaking of Dean, is there still a Dean?"
"RORY: Yeah, there's still a Dean."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: I don't know what I was doing. Maybe it's because I haven't dated a lot but this Jess thing was crazy. And I do love Dean and you were absolutely right  I was treating him like dirt and I wasn't appreciating what was right in front of me, but I'm going to now."
"LORELAI: Rory, I don't want you to stay with Dean because of me."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: Cause I was upset earlier."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: I still have this Christopher thing bugging me and the pressure of tonight's dinner."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: I didn't wanna upset you and I certainly don't want you to make an important decision off of "
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Because it's too important "
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: And I just want you to be happy."
"RORY: Mom! All I did was think about what you said, that's all. Then I analyzed the situation."
"LORELAI: And then you made a pro and con list."
"RORY: You're mocking me, but yes, I did. And after all of this, I came to the conclusion that I want to make things good with Dean, and he deserves my undivided attention."
"LORELAI: And you feel good about this?"
"RORY: I feel really good about this."
"LORELAI: Okay, because if you decided you really did wanna date Jess, I would help you. . .get vaccinated."
"RORY: Thank you, but I'm good."
"LORELAI: All right, as long as you're good."
"RORY: I am good."
"LORELAI: Well, okay, good."
"RORY: What about you, are you good?"
"LORELAI: Me? Well, I'm gonna be good."
"RORY: Is there anything I can do to help?"
"LORELAI: Your existence is a huge help."
"RORY: We're both gonna be good."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I wonder if Christopher and Sherry's baby is going to look like me?"
"RORY: Well, if the kid knows what's good for it, it absolutely will."
"LORELAI: Hand me my purse, will you? I'm hungry."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are sitting in the living room]"
"RORY: Well, this is nice, isn't it? [pause] So, Grandma, Grandpa is traveling again, huh?"
"EMILY: Yes, he is."
"RORY: Business must be good."
"EMILY: Seems to be."
"RORY: That's great. Isn't that great, Mom?"
"LORELAI: A jig is forthcoming."
"RORY: Mom's business is great, too. I mean, not that it's without its problem, you know, but they're usually funny problems. . .like, um. . .oh! Mom, why don't you tell Grandma about the mouse?"
"EMILY: What mouse?"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: There's a mouse at the inn."
"EMILY: Is the place dirty?"
"LORELAI: No, it's just surrounded by this thing called nature and. . .mice happen."
"EMILY: Mice carry diseases, you know."
"LORELAI: It's a tiny little field mouse, Mom."
"EMILY: I don't care how big it is, it's still a rodent."
"LORELAI: Let's just change the subject, shall we?"
"EMILY: You should set a trap."
"LORELAI: Got it covered."
"EMILY: Just make sure you don't use poison."
"LORELAI: Got it covered."
"EMILY: They will eat the poison and then go into the walls and die, decompose, and the entire place will smell."
"LORELAI: I've got it covered, but thanks."
"EMILY: I just have to say, I don't know why you're the one sitting here with an attitude. I'm the one who should be mad."
"LORELAI: Let's not do this, okay Mom?"
"EMILY: After all, you're the one who just walked out of here last week without saying a word."
"LORELAI: Because I couldn't get a word in."
"EMILY: Your father and I were shocked and upset."
"LORELAI: So what else is new?"
"EMILY: You didn't give us five minutes to digest the news."
"LORELAI: Please, find the off switch."
"EMILY: You simply dumped it on us and walked out. I hardly think that's fair."
"LORELAI: Mom, it doesn't matter. It's over. Let's just move on, okay? We came here to have a nice evening, so. . .come on, let's have it. [picks up the newspaper from the coffee table]"
"RORY: Something smells good."
"EMILY: Braised lamb shank."
"RORY: Oh, braised lamb shank! I love a lamb shank when it is braised."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"EMILY: Reading in front of other people is extremely rude, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Shauna Christy sh*t her husband."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Shauna Christy, you remember Shauna Christy."
"EMILY: Yes, I remember Shauna Christy, she was a lovely girl."
"LORELAI: Well, apparently this lovely girl came home to find her husband giving the nanny a nice little bonus package. And they say good help is hard to find."
"EMILY: That's just gossip."
"LORELAI: Gossip? The man was sh*t thirty-five times. He looks like a sprinkler system."
"EMILY: I can't believe this. Shauna was always such a nice girl. She was bright, cultured, well-spoken."
"LORELAI: And apparently a big Annie Oakley fan."
"EMILY: This is not funny, the woman committed a crime."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine."
"EMILY: This is a tragedy."
"LORELAI: My bad, sorry."
"EMILY: A man is dead, a young woman ruined."
"LORELAI: Consider the subject dropped."
"EMILY: At least she had a husband to k*ll."
"LORELAI: This is nice, isn't it?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table; Lorelai sneezes]"
"RORY: Bless you."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Ugh, I hate having a cold."
"RORY: I know you do."
"LORELAI: Ugh, it's bad enough being sick, but anybody can have a cold."
"RORY: I know they can."
"LORELAI: I mean, I'd like to have a good illness, something different, impressive. Just once I'd like to be able to say, ""Yeah, I'm not feeling so good, my leg is haunted."""
"RORY: See, there's a reason why you only take one packet of TheraFlu at a time."
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"[Luke brings their food]"
"LUKE: All right, pancakes, one fried egg, side of bacon. Chicken noodle soup, side of mashed potatoes."
"RORY: Thanks, Luke."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"LUKE: How's the cold coming?"
"LORELAI: It's fine."
"LUKE: Any better?"
"LORELAI: It's fine."
"LUKE: It's the third day in a row you've ordered soup for breakfast."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks for the tally."
"LUKE: You know what helps get rid of a cold?"
"LORELAI: Endless vague questioning first thing in the morning?"
"LUKE: A healthy immune system."
"LORELAI: My second guess."
"LUKE: And you know how you get a healthy immune system?"
"LORELAI: Remember when you hated me? That was fun, wasn't it?"
"LUKE: Is it eating nothing but crap all day and blowing out your brain cells with coffee?"
"RORY: No."
"LUKE: That's right, no."
"LORELAI: Why are you helping him?"
"RORY: No seemed like the right answer."
"LUKE: Eat a vegetable now and then, maybe some high fiber cereal in the morning."
"LORELAI: Listen, Grandpa, my soup's getting cold."
"LUKE: At least eat the carrots in the soup this time, not just the noodles."
"LORELAI: I promise."
"[Luke walks away; Lorelai holds her bowl of soup toward Rory]"
"LORELAI: Eat my carrots."
"RORY: Apparently, maturity is extremely overrated in your universe."
"LORELAI: That's right. The Empress Bobo Belle forbids it. Eat."
"[Jess' girlfriend Shane walks up to Jess at the counter]"
"SHANE: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"[they kiss]"
"SHANE: So?"
"JESS: One sec."
"SHANE: Jess."
"JESS: Relax. I'm out. Let's go."
"SHANE: Okay."
"[they leave]"
"LORELAI: Ladies and gentlemen, an entire conversation in ten words or less."
"RORY: A true meeting of the minds."
"[Dean walks up to their table]"
"DEAN: Okay, so, uh, please don't hate me, but I already ate breakfast."
"RORY: See, nice full sentences."
"DEAN: What?"
"LORELAI: Don't ruin it."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai and Michel are looking into the fireplace]"
"LORELAI: You're sure?"
"MICHEL: Positive. It ran right across the lobby and into the fireplace."
"LORELAI: I don't see it."
"MICHEL: Well, it must've found a hole to crawl into."
"LORELAI: We cannot have this mouse running around the inn. Customers will freak."
"MICHEL: Well, tell them it's a baby. People love babies. They'll talk to it in funny voices."
"LORELAI: Did you call an exterminator?"
"MICHEL: Why, no, what a wonderful idea. I was actually going to fasten a large wedge of cheese to my head and lay on the ground until Mickey gets hungry and decides to crawl out and snack on my face."
"LORELAI: When does he get here?"
"MICHEL: He said we were the first stop."
"LORELAI: What do we do until them?"
"MICHEL: Make cat sounds?"
"[Kirk walks into the inn carrying a package]"
"KIRK: Excuse me, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey Kirk. Hold on a sec. [to Michel] Just stand here and make sure it doesn't come out."
"MICHEL: Oh, goody, a promotion."
"LORELAI: [walks over to Kirk] Hi Kirk. What can I do for ya?"
"KIRK: I have a delivery for Sookie."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, anything good?"
"KIRK: No, just some wedding photos."
"LORELAI: Great. Well, she stepped out for a minute, but I'll take them to her. I swear, I'll give them to her. If you want, I'll leave and find her and then I'll give them to her."
"KIRK: No, that won't be necessary."
"LORELAI: Okay, well. . ."
"KIRK: Uh, Lorelai, can I speak to you for a moment?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure."
"KIRK: Could we sit?"
"LORELAI: Sit. . .sure, let's sit. [they sit down on the sofa] Is everything okay?"
"KIRK: Okay?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"KIRK: With me?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"KIRK: Well, my mother has developed a condition  makes her knees enormous. Yesterday I spent all morning cutting holes in her pants so she could sit, but other than that and the dyspeptic parrot problem, everything is fine."
"LORELAI: Well, good, I'm glad. Okay, well, um, I'm gonna "
"KIRK: I was just wondering . . ."
"LORELAI: Yes. . .wondering what?"
"KIRK: We've known each other for a good amount of time now. Our, uh, paths have crossed professionally and socially a number of times, all with relatively pleasant results, and well, I was just wondering if you would like to have dinner with me?"
"LORELAI: Oh."
"KIRK: In two weeks."
"LORELAI: Two weeks?"
"KIRK: I heard you have a cold. I think two weeks is enough time to ensure the virus is out of your system."
"LORELAI: Well, Kirk, I "
"KIRK: You don't have to answer me right away. I know that this is completely out of the blue for you. Take a few days and think about it. [starts walking toward the door]"
"LORELAI: Kirk, wait."
"KIRK: By the way, I think you might be the prettiest girl I've ever seen. . .outside of a really filthy magazine."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Kirk leaves; Lorelai walks past Michel]"
"LORELAI: Don't."
"MICHEL: I am doing nothing. Ben, however, has dropped dead from laughter."
"CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory wakes up and sees Lorelai sitting in a chair staring at her]"
"RORY: How long have you been sitting there?"
"LORELAI: Not long. An hour. . .and a half."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because."
"RORY: Cause why?"
"LORELAI: Because today is the last first day of high school you're ever gonna have."
"RORY: You're insane."
"LORELAI: I'm not insane, I'm just sentimental, and you're grown."
"RORY: I'm not grown."
"LORELAI: Yes, you are, you're all grown up and soon you'll be going off into the world."
"RORY: Not yet."
"LORELAI: But soon. And after you spread those wings and fly away, I won't have the opportunity to give you this."
"[Lorelai hands her a piece of paper]"
"RORY: What is it?"
"LORELAI: It's your bill."
"RORY: My what?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I've been crunching the numbers, you know, adding up what you've cost me over the years  raising you, clothing you, feeding you, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"LORELAI: Yes, I've itemized everything here by years and income ratio. I thought you could factor it into your student loan."
"RORY: Oh boy."
"LORELAI: One thing that's painfully obvious here  you've used an extraordinary number of diapers."
"RORY: I'm gonna go take a shower."
"LORELAI: Really, it's cost a fortune. What were you using all those diapers for?"
"RORY: I was building my make Mommy go away' castle."
"LORELAI: All right, you got home too late last night and I didn't get a chance to talk to you."
"RORY: I got home at ten and you were already asleep."
"LORELAI: Well, I was trying to watch The Legend of Bagger Vance again."
"RORY: Okay, what did I miss?"
"LORELAI: Okay. Kirk asked me out."
"RORY: Shut up!"
"LORELAI: Yesterday he came to the inn and asked me to dinner."
"RORY: That's so sweet."
"LORELAI: Sweet?"
"RORY: You should wear your dress with the ponies on it. I bet he likes ponies."
"LORELAI: Rory, I cannot go out with Kirk."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh. . .why? He's. . .he's Kirk!"
"RORY: Well, as long as he loves you."
"LORELAI: You are not serious."
"RORY: I just want you to be happy."
"LORELAI: ""Hello Headmaster Charleston, this is my stepfather Kirk. Please don't make any sudden movements, he's a fear biter."""
"RORY: Okay, so how will you let him down?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. That's why I needed to talk to you, you're the nice one in the family."
"RORY: Well, you could just tell him the truth. You could tell him that you're not interested in dating him and that you just wanna be friends."
"LORELAI: That sounds so lame."
"RORY: You could tell him you're involved with someone."
"LORELAI: Yeah, because my current karma is so great in that area, I can really afford to jinx it with that kind of lie  no!"
"RORY: Okay, then you figure it out."
"LORELAI: All right. . .we're gonna have to move."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Take off in the middle of the night, leave everything behind, assume different identities. I'll join a local community theater and I'll drive you to soccer. It'll work for many years until the FBI comes to get me, and by that time, you're on your own."
"RORY: I don't play soccer."
"LORELAI: You do now."
"[they walk into the kitchen; as they start getting out stuff for breakfast, Rory laughs.]"
"LORELAI: Stop!"
"RORY: It's funny."
"LORELAI: It's not funny, it's bad! I have to see this guy. He works at every business in town, I can't get away from him!"
"RORY: Well, then you should marry him and move in with his mother."
"LORELAI: I'll handle it myself, thank you very much."
"RORY: Sorry, just trying to help."
"LORELAI: So you have your swearing in ceremony today."
"RORY: At three, do not be late."
"LORELAI: I will not be late."
"RORY: Okay, I have something to tell you."
"LORELAI: Is it about Vince Foster?"
"RORY: It's about Grandma."
"LORELAI: Oops."
"RORY: She's coming today."
"LORELAI: No!"
"RORY: Mom, I'm sorry. She found out about it, she called. . ."
"LORELAI: And you said yes?"
"RORY: She's my grandmother."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: So what am I supposed to say?"
"LORELAI: Say ""Sorry, Grandma, but if my mother sees you, she'll run screaming down the hall."""
"RORY: You'll be sitting there listening to the ceremony, you hardly have to talk at all."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Hey, we are family."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, look how great that worked out for Sister Sledge."
"RORY: I'm gonna go take a shower. You'll be pouting out here when I'm done?"
"LORELAI: No, I gotta go to work. I'll see you this afternoon."
"RORY: At three."
"LORELAI: There goes my little vice president, off to rule the world."
"RORY: Well, Paris will be ruling the world. I will be holding her keys."
"LORELAI: I'm still proud of you."
"RORY: I appreciate it."
"LORELAI: Honey, you have power, brains, now all you need is a dimwitted, drunken or drug-addicted relative to constantly humiliate you while you serve in office."
"RORY: Will you work on that for me?"
"LORELAI: Two steps ahead of you."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory is standing in the hallway as Lorelai runs up to her]"
"LORELAI: Ah, time?"
"RORY: 3:01."
"LORELAI: No, oh man, not fair, stupid traffic lights!"
"RORY: That's okay, it doesn't start til 3:15."
"LORELAI: But I so tried to . . . you lied to me."
"RORY: Did I?"
"LORELAI: You said it was at three, and it's at three-fifteen."
"RORY: Well, I guess I did."
"LORELAI: Ah! That's it, I'm standing up in the middle of your speech and demanding a recount."
"RORY: Shall we seat you?"
"LORELAI: Betrayed, lied to and humiliated."
"[they walk into the auditorium]"
"RORY: Well, get used to it  I am in politics now."
"LORELAI: Hey, where's, uh. . ."
"RORY: She's not here yet."
"LORELAI: You told her the real time, didn't you?"
"RORY: Well, Grandma can handle structure. How's this?"
"LORELAI: Fine."
"RORY: Okay, great. You can sit there and you can put your purse on that chair to save it for Grandma."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, great idea."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Fine, yeah, saving the seat. [sits down and puts her purse on the chair next to her] There, all saved."
"RORY: Thank you. Now, I'll meet right outside afterwards, okay?"
"LORELAI: Okay. I just want you to remember three things while you're sitting up there: I love you, you're the greatest kid in the world, and you're in a skirt, keep your knees closed."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Hey, this is good advice. When I was in school, Linda Lee was class treasurer and she could not keep her knees closed if they were magnetized. Hanes should've given her an endorsement deal."
"[Rory walks away; Lorelai takes her purse off the seat next to her and holds it on her lap...then puts it back on the chair...then picks it back up again. She's about to put it back on the chair when Emily walks up]"
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"EMILY: [sits down] You could've put your handbag there to save my seat, you know."
"[cut to Headmaster Charleston at the podium on stage]"
"HEADMASTER: Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you. Assemblies like this are always happy ones for me, initiating in a new group of school leaders. Chilton's always prided itself on the quality of its student government, and this year we may have outdone ourselves. These young men and women up on this stage represent the best and the brightest of what this school has to offer. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present to you your student body government of 2003. [applause]"
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"RORY: [at podium] . . .a larger awareness of the world around us. Problems that not only face us here at school but will face us when we leave school, and more importantly, will face the next generation that follows us. We must learn that our actions have consequences, that someone else will have to clean up our mess. We need to figure out how to make that mess a little smaller. If a small fraction of these things can be accomplished this year, then I will feel like our administration has done its job. Thank you. [applause]"
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"PARIS: [at podium] In the past, all great empires have fallen. The feeling seems to be that it's inevitable  that something like what the Romans built could not last. Maybe they're right. Maybe there is no way of keeping something that big and prosperous permanently. Maybe there is no way of keeping our legacy from becoming obsolete. Well, I intend to fly in the face of such thinking, and damn it, I will succeed. I certainly don't wanna come back here twenty years from now on Alumni's Night and find this place turned into a high priced charm school, pink and white with big cheerleading megaphones painted on the walls. I wouldn't be able to take it. I would have to dismantle the place stone by stone with my bare hands. . ."
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"ALL STUDENTS ON STAGE: I have faith in the Chilton Handbook, so let it be forever."
"HEADMASTER: Congratulations and good luck. [applause]"
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Emily are waiting outside the auditorium.]"
"EMILY: Is Rory coming out?"
"LORELAI: That's what she said. It was a nice ceremony."
"EMILY: Yes, it was."
"LORELAI: Long."
"EMILY: Very long."
"LORELAI: The longest."
"EMILY: Lorelai "
"RORY: [walking up to them] Hey. You're both here."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we're here."
"EMILY: Of course we're here. We wouldn't have missed it for the world. You looked wonderful up there, Rory."
"LORELAI: Yeah, good job with the knees."
"RORY: Thank you. I'm gonna run to my locker and get my backpack, then we can go."
"LORELAI: I'll be here."
"RORY: Bye Grandma. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: You know, you don't have to wait, Mom, if you have things to do."
"EMILY: Oh. . .well, all right. [starts to walk away, then turns back] Lorelai, I was wondering if we could have lunch."
"LORELAI: Lunch?"
"EMILY: Yes, just the two of us."
"LORELAI: Oh, well "
"EMILY: Tomorrow would be good for me."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow, lunch tomorrow, lunch with you tomorrow. . ."
"EMILY: We can do it anywhere you'd like. Perhaps at that Luke's Diner you two seem to love so much."
"LORELAI: Lunch  at Luke's  with you? Wow, I can't even put the visual together."
"EMILY: I can meet you there at one."
"LORELAI: One? Well "
"EMILY: If one isn't good, you pick a time. I'll make it work."
"LORELAI: All right. One o'clock at Luke's."
"EMILY: Wonderful. I'll see you then."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Several students are sitting at a table as Paris walks around them talking]"
"PARIS: Look, let's face it, the last administration might have just as well been running around yelling Toga!' for all the brilliant things they accomplished. But this year  everything changes, starting with the library. It's completely out of proportion with its subjects. I mean, there's five hundred volumes on the French Revolution, yet only three on the Crusades. How do they expect us to get a decent education with inferior resources like that? Huh, seems like the hour's almost up. Okay, well, I think this has been an extremely successful first gathering. I appreciate all the class presidents coming and being on time. So before I adjourn this meeting, is there anything anyone would like to say?"
"RORY: People's names might have been nice."
"FRANCIE: Actually, I have something I'd like to put on the table to be discussed."
"PARIS: Oh, okay. Well, we only have a couple of minutes, so give us the Reader's Digest version."
"FRANCIE: As president of the senior class, a certain problem has been brought to my attention. For the past thirty years, the Chilton regulations have stated that skirts must be no higher than three-quarters of an inch above the knee, that's it. Any higher, the student gets written up. I propose to put to an immediate vote an amendment to raise hemlines an additional inch and a half."
"PARIS: Hemlines?"
"FRANCIE: That's right."
"PARIS: That's the major issue on the senior class' mind?"
"FRANCIE: It's one of the major issues, yes."
"PARIS: Well, okay  thank you, Francie, for giving us something really important to mull over here. I anticipate a lot of sleepless nights for many of the people in this room. I will take that under advisement and get back to you as soon as I can."
"FRANCIE: Oh, okay, fine. Thanks."
"PARIS: Now, if that's it, I officially call the first meeting of the Chilton student body presidents to a close. I'll see you all Friday. [bangs gavel on the table]"
"GIRL: What idiot gave her a gavel?"
"[Rory walks up to Paris]"
"RORY: Okay, see, the whole point of having an informal get to know you' gathering was actually to have an informal get to know you' gathering."
"PARIS: What's your point?"
"RORY: You just spent an hour walking around talking about your agenda."
"PARIS: I'm student body president  that's my job."
"RORY: But we got donuts, and we didn't touch the donuts. The donuts are still sitting next to the coffee that we never passed out. We were supposed to spend this time to talk, bond, get to know each other."
"PARIS: Geez, Rory, we've been sitting in a room together for sixty minutes  what else do you want, a ring?"
"FRANCIE: Hi. Excuse me, Paris? I just wanted to say on behalf of the entire senior class, congratulations on your win and I'm really looking forward to working very closely with you this year."
"PARIS: Thanks."
"FRANCIE: Okay. See you later. Bye Rory. You two are gonna make a great team. [leaves]"
"PARIS: Yes, the jerseys are coming on Friday. [to Rory] Okay, I'm gonna drop the demand for the librarian's resignation tonight. You wanna read it before I send it?"
"RORY: Are you sure the first thing you wanna do in office is to get a ninety-three year old woman sacked?"
"PARIS: Hey, at least I'm not putting her on an iceberg and shoving her off to sea, which considering the fact that you can't find the Shakespeare section without psychic powers yet the Cliffs Notes rack practically smacks you in the face on the way in, is totally justified."
"RORY: And we're off."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie walks up to Lorelai in the lobby]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, I just got a message that a vegetarian menu was requested for tonight."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Lasano's, party of five at eight o'clock."
"SOOKIE: I thought you said you weren't gonna let vegetarians in here anymore."
"LORELAI: No, you said you weren't gonna let vegetarians in here anymore."
"SOOKIE: But I'm making my baked stuffed pork chops for tonight."
"LORELAI: Well, make them for the other guests and make something else for the Lasano's."
"SOOKIE: Like what?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Pasta, you make great pasta."
"SOOKIE: But that's boring, anyone can make pasta. I'm an artist. You don't dictate to an artist, you don't tell him what to do. I mean, no ever walked up to Degas and said, ""Hey, pal, easy with the dancers, enough already. Draw a nice fruit bowl once in awhile, will ya?"""
"LORELAI: A great artist can make art out of anything, including pasta."
"SOOKIE: Fine, pasta, whoo."
"LORELAI: Is there coffee?"
"SOOKIE: Just made some."
"LORELAI: Great."
"SOOKIE: So today's your lunch with Emily."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"SOOKIE: Any idea what she's gonna say?"
"LORELAI: No, but I bet it's not, ""I'm joining the circus, feed your father until I get back."" I should just cancel."
"SOOKIE: You can't cancel, you're meeting her in an hour."
"LORELAI: I know, but this goes against every rule I have in the Gilmore survival guide. Number one  no running with scissors. Number two  no pageboy haircuts. Number three  never ever have lunch alone with a mother."
"SOOKIE: It might not be so bad."
"LORELAI: Saying yes to this lunch with my mother is like saying ""Sounds fun!"" to a ride with Clemenza."
"[they walk into the kitchen]"
"SOOKIE: Think good thoughts, she could surprise you."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"SOOKIE: People change, you know. They do it every day. I mean, one minute you could be. . .oh, let's say a vegetarian, and the next minute you could accidentally have a bite of a stuffed pork chop that changes your entire way of thinking."
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Oh, suddenly life's fun, suddenly there's a reason to get up in the morning  it's called bacon!"
"LORELAI: Forget it."
"SOOKIE: Come on!"
"LORELAI: Pasta."
"SOOKIE: Let the people grow, dammit!"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory is walking down the hallway when someone pulls her into the bathroom. Francie and two of her friends are in there.]"
"FRANCIE: Rory, hi, nice of you to join us."
"RORY: Francie, what "
"FRANCIE: No, I talk, okay? Great. Now let's discuss Paris."
"RORY: What about her?"
"FRANCIE: She seems to have the very strange idea that she's actually in charge around here, and I thought it'd be good if I let you in on a little secret. . .she's not."
"RORY: Why don't you tell her this yourself?"
"FRANCIE: Because talking to Paris is like shopping for a bathing suit in December  frustrating, fruitless, and a complete waste of time. Now, you, you might be the wallflower, but you're obviously the Meyer Lansky behind this organization."
"RORY: I am not the Meyer Lansky."
"FRANCIE: What's that noise? What is that noise? Oh wait, it's me, still talking. Didn't you hear it? Obviously not. Anyhow, Paris is student body president  big fat deal. There are three other class presidents  the junior class president, the sophomore class president, and oh, yes, the senior class president  me."
"RORY: I know all this."
"FRANCIE: Well, then, it's off the short bus for you, isn't it? Now if Paris thinks she's gonna march around dictating mandates and ignoring what I have to say, then she's in for a major bikini wax."
"RORY: Thanks for the visual."
"FRANCIE: Without me, she's nothing. Just another power mad, insecure, friendless, dateless, highlight-less loser wandering around trying to make someone care that they exist at all, which, by the way, no one does. I control the senior class. I am also the leader of the Puffs, the most exclusive society on this campus, and I have the power to make her life a living hell."
"RORY: Francie, she's just "
"FRANCIE: I can make sure she does nothing this year but lead the student body in whatever version of the Pledge of Allegiance happens to be constitutional at the time."
"RORY: What do you want me to do about it?"
"FRANCIE: I want you to go back to Margaret Thatcher and tell her to play ball. She's gonna support the hemline issue, and any other issue that I bring up for the rest of the year. Otherwise I'll make her so ineffectual, she'll make Jimmy Carter look like Martin Sheen  do you get me?"
"RORY: We're supposed to be representing the interests of the student body. We are not supposed to be brokering backdoor deals and pushing through agendas with intimidation and bribery. I mean, what are we, French skating judges?"
"FRANCIE: Wise up, Goldilocks."
"RORY: My hair's brown."
"FRANCIE: This is politics. If you've got a problem, tell it to Noam Chomsky. I live in the real world, now blow. Oh, and I would keep this conversation between you and me. Paris tends to get a little paranoid when there's other mammals at the watering hole, so her finding out that you were conferring with me might not make your vice presidency any easier."
"RORY: I am not conferring with you. A hand came out of the bathroom and pulled me in."
"FRANCIE: What are you talking about? You sought me out because you thought Paris was a little out of line today and you wanted to make sure my very delicate feelings weren't hurt. You are so sweet to think of me. I feel much better now that I have you on my side. Bye now, see you at the hemster."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks through the door and looks around for Emily]"
"LUKE: What the hell are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Ah, I came for the warmth."
"LUKE: Well, you're just not usually here this time of day, that's all."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm meeting someone for lunch."
"LUKE: Oh, Kirk?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You're meeting Kirk?"
"LORELAI: Why would you say that?"
"LUKE: Well, I know he asked you out so I just assumed."
"LORELAI: How do you know he asked me out?"
"LUKE: He told me."
"LORELAI: He told you?"
"LUKE: Yesterday."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"LUKE: Hey, relax, I think it's great."
"LORELAI: Why, why would he tell you?"
"LUKE: Well, actually, he came to me for a little advice."
"LORELAI: About what?"
"LUKE: About whether or not I thought he had a sh*t with you. After all, I know ya, I've been to your house, I know whether or not you have stain resistant rugs."
"[Lorelai sits down at a table]"
"LORELAI: I'm lying down now."
"LUKE: When he found out you had wood floors, he seemed very pleased."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: I told him you like movies and junk food, and of course, talking incessantly, but we both agreed that there's nothing like some good lovin' to shut a person up, if you know what I mean."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, can you bring me a sharper fork? I'm not sure this one will go all the way through your hand."
"LUKE: Okay, now, I know it's new so you probably don't wanna jinx it, so I won't talk about it anymore. But I have to tell you, seeing that guy's face when he was talking about you. . .he almost had an expression."
"LORELAI: Far, far away from me."
"LUKE: [sings] Love is in the air."
"[Lorelai throws a spoon at him as he walks away]"
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"[Emily walks into the diner]"
"EMILY: Why are you throwing cutlery in a public place?"
"LORELAI: Uh, cause I feel stupid doing it at home?"
"EMILY: I'm sorry I'm late, there was a little traffic on the way. Perhaps had I been on time, there would still be the possibility of soup."
"LORELAI: I haven't been here that long. See, I still have a knife."
"EMILY: I'm glad to hear it."
"LORELAI: So, you gonna sit?"
"EMILY: Oh, yes, of course. [wipes off the seat, then sits down] There we go. Well, this is nice. You certainly can see the whole town from here, can't you?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you can."
"EMILY: I can see why you come here so much. It must be fun to just sit and people-watch. Well, let's see what they've got, shall we? [opens menu] Oh, Caesar salad  is that good here?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm sure it is."
"EMILY: You've never had it?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Has Rory?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Oh. Well, Caesar salads can be extremely unsafe if they use bad eggs."
"LORELAI: Get something else."
"EMILY: Of course, if they're coddled, it would be fine. Do you know if they coddle the eggs here?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea."
"EMILY: You don't know? You come here every day."
"LORELAI: Why don't you ask Luke if they're coddled?"
"EMILY: Oh, he'll just say they are. I'll have a Cobb salad. What are you going to have?"
"LORELAI: A Caesar salad with extra uncoddled eggs on the side."
"EMILY: Really, Lorelai, would a serious answer once in awhile k*ll you?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, Mom. Uh, honestly, I'm a little confused."
"EMILY: About what?"
"LORELAI: About this."
"EMILY: What's confusing? We're having lunch."
"LORELAI: I know we're having lunch, but we don't usually have lunch, especially not in my town at Luke's Diner."
"EMILY: I just figured you had to work, it'd be easier on you this way."
"LORELAI: Okay, that's fine, if I "
"[Luke walks up to the table]"
"LUKE: You two ready to order?"
"EMILY: Yes. How is your Caesar salad dressing prepared?"
"LUKE: I'll have to call Paul Newman and ask him."
"EMILY: A Cobb salad and an iced tea."
"LORELAI: Cheeseburger, fries, onion rings and a cherry coke."
"LUKE: Any pie today?"
"LORELAI: Hm, no thanks."
"LUKE: Cutting back a little, huh? Trying to look good for the big day. Smart, very smart."
"LORELAI: Make sure you check that frying oil with your face."
"[Luke walks away]"
"EMILY: What was that all about?"
"LORELAI: Ah, nothing, just a little small town charm. Now, please, Mom, tell me  why did you ask me to lunch?"
"EMILY: Because I wanted to spend some time alone with my daughter."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Well, Rory drops by after school every now and then, so we see her alone."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: But we never see you alone. . .unless Rory leaves the room for a second, and even then you try to go with her. If I had a nickel for every time you've used the Girls always go to the bathroom together, Mom' line, I'd be a very rich woman."
"LORELAI: You are a very rich woman. Mom, please, is this really a me and you' lunch? No hidden agenda?"
"EMILY: Of course not."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine."
"EMILY: I talked to Christopher."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: I called him last week, we talked for a very long time, and I have to tell you, he is not in love with that woman."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"EMILY: He never came out and said it, but I could tell from his voice. He would much rather be with you and Rory."
"LORELAI: Are you out of your mind?"
"EMILY: I think you need to talk to him."
"LORELAI: And that would be a yes."
"EMILY: All he needs is to hear that you want this, too."
"LORELAI: Mom, what the hell are you doing calling Christopher?"
"EMILY: Well, somebody had to."
"LORELAI: No, somebody didn't have to!"
"EMILY: Oh, I certainly wasn't going to just sit by and watch this situation explode. You two belong together. It took you years to figure that out, and now that you finally have it, you can't let it go away just because of a little complication."
"LORELAI: Mom, his girlfriend is pregnant  that is more than a little complication."
"EMILY: Women have gotten pregnant since the beginning of time, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: And before I result to the totally called for duh, please tell me what your point it."
"EMILY: This woman is trying to trap him. Don't you see that? You can't let that happen."
"LORELAI: Mom, this is none of your business."
"EMILY: Yes, it is! It affects Rory, it affects you  both of whom are my business."
"LORELAI: Do not get involved in this, I mean it. Butt out! Don't call Christopher and talk about me or us, just stay out of it!"
"EMILY: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I have to get back to the inn."
"EMILY: Do not walk out on me."
"LORELAI: Mom, I am not gonna discuss this with you now or ever. I would love for you to respect that but I know you, so give Christopher my love."
"EMILY: A family life doesn't just happen, Lorelai. You have to work for it. You have to fight for it. Lorelai, come back here!"
"[Lorelai walks out]"

"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Several students are gathered at a table for a meeting]"
"PARIS: So as soon as she gets out of intensive care, we'll get her signature, and then we can finally set about hiring a new librarian. Anything else?"
"LOUISE: Yes. Uh, I was thinking that maybe this year we should throw a little beginning of the school year dance. I mean, why wait until the tan fades to have a formal?"
"PARIS: Dances are distracting."
"LOUISE: Dances help bring in money to pay for those stupid topiaries you want in the quad."
"PARIS: Draft a proposal and have it on my desk by tomorrow. Madeline?"
"MADELINE: I would like to explore the option of having a professional photographer take the senior class photos. Every year we use that cheesy picture place, and every year people wind up with those VH1 Before They Were Stars' pictures, and I for one would like to stop the humiliation now."
"PARIS: How are we going to get a professional photographer?"
"LOUISE: Helmett Newton is my godfather."
"PARIS: Okay, sign him up  and tell him to leave the whips and chains at home. All right, I think that's all we have time for today."
"FRANCIE: Um, excuse me, Paris? I was just wondering if you had time to think about my proposal?"
"PARIS: What proposal?"
"FRANCIE: You know, the higher hemlines."
"PARIS: Oh right. No, not yet."
"FRANCIE: Okay, I guess I can wait. . . for awhile."
"PARIS: Patience is a virtue."
"[The meeting ends and the students disperse from the table. Rory turns to talk to Paris.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"PARIS: What do you think about Helmett Newton being Louise's godfather? Explains a lot, doesn't it?"
"RORY: Yeah. Listen, I think it might be a good idea to consider getting behind this hemline issue."
"PARIS: You're kidding, right?"
"RORY: No. I mean, if girls want the option of making their skirts a little shorter, then who cares, right?"
"PARIS: I care. I'm building a legacy here, Rory. You want the first stand I make against the faculty to involve a fashion choice? It would be my gays in the military.'"
"RORY: I just think it would be really smart to establish some goodwill among the other class presidents."
"PARIS: Why?"
"RORY: Because you have to work with them, and you might even need their support on something in the future. And throwing them a tiny bone like a hemline amendment is no big deal."
"PARIS: I don't know."
"RORY: Look, it's right at the beginning of your term. No one will even remember the first stupid thing that you passed. You have plenty of time to establish your legacy. I mean it. By the time that you implement public executions for line cutters, hemlines will be a thing of the past. [pause] I was making a joke not a suggestion."
"PARIS: Why do you care?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Why do you care? You seem very invested in this whole thing  why?"
"RORY: Hey, I'm not invested in this thing. If you don't wanna do it, fine. I'm just giving you my opinion. I just thought you might wanna be one of those presidents that's beloved as well as respected."
"PARIS: Raising hemlines would make me beloved?"
"RORY: It's certainly a step in that direction."
"PARIS: All right, I'll push it through."
"RORY: Good."
"PARIS: But the next genius who comes up with the brilliant plan to put Elizabeth Arden in the chemistry class can bite my ass."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks into the living room as Lorelai walks down the steps]"
"LORELAI: Ugh, I'm not going."
"RORY: You are going."
"LORELAI: She has done this to me for the last time. From now on, I'm not giving her any information about my life at all."
"RORY: As opposed to all the details you've heaped upon her in the past."
"LORELAI: I can't believe she called Christopher. She has no respect for me or my feelings or my privacy."
"RORY: Well, she didn't think of it that way. She thought that she was helping."
"LORELAI: You do know there isn't a Santa Claus, don't you?"
"RORY: Please just try to forget this."
"LORELAI: I'm never ever going over there again."
"RORY: Not an option."
"LORELAI: It should be. Sometimes you have to cut people out of your life."
"RORY: She's your mother."
"LORELAI: I want proof, I want tests done."
"RORY: Do you want your red purse or your blue?"
"LORELAI: Blue. Gee, I wonder who else she's calling. She's probably on the phone to Kirk right now. ""I heard through my spies you're taking my daughter out to dinner. Let's talk China patterns."" God, I'm furious! [phone rings] Don't get that, it might be her."
"RORY: Well, I doubt she'd call when we're supposed to be over in half an hour."
"KIRK: [on answering machine] Hello? Hello? [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: The answering machine confused him."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: And that's the guy who likes me."
"RORY: I'd consider adoption if I were you."
"LORELAI: My life stinks. Hey, let's look into each other's eyes and say ""I wish I were you"" at exactly the same time  maybe we'll pull a Freaky Friday!"
"RORY: Or we can just pretend that we did and you can go around acting really immature. Oh wait. . ."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you won't switch bodies with me."
"RORY: Forget it. Then I'd have to date Kirk."
"LORELAI: I would switch bodies with you in a b*at if you wanted."
"[phone rings again]"
"RORY: I know, and I appreciate that."
"KIRK: [on answering machine] Lorelai, hi. I just called, I think there might be a problem with your phone."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"KIRK: [on machine] I was just wondering if I could ask you. . ."
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"KIRK: [on machine] . . .a couple of quick questions "
"KIRK'S MOM: [on machine] Hello?"
"KIRK: [on machine] Mom?"
"KIRK'S MOM: [on machine] Who is this?"
"KIRK: [on machine] Mom, would you please get off the phone? Mom?"
"KIRK'S MOM: [on machine] Is this Dr. Marshall?"
"KIRK: [on machine] Mom, it's an important phone call, please hang up. I  I  I  I'll call you back."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings several times]"
"EMILY: [walking toward door] Oh, for heaven's sake. [answers door]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I don't think your doorbell's working."
"EMILY: Believe me, it's not the doorbell."
"MAID: [walks up behind them] Oh, so it was the door."
"EMILY: Yes, Sarah, once again, it was the door."
"SARAH: Okay, so I just have to remember that the really big bell is the door and the small one is the oven."
"EMILY: Yes, that would be a wonderful thing to remember."
"[Sarah walks away]"
"EMILY: Okay, well, let's have a drink, shall we?"
"[they walk to the living room]"
"RORY: So, Grandma, you have a new maid?"
"EMILY: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Well, good thing we're in time for happy hour."
"EMILY: Wine, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah, if there's any left."
"EMILY: Rory  soda or water?"
"RORY: Uh, soda please."
"EMILY: How about water?"
"RORY: Water's fine, too."
"LORELAI: What's up, Mom?"
"EMILY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: You seem tense."
"EMILY: You always think I seem tense."
"LORELAI: But tonight you seem tenser than usual."
"EMILY: Well, I'm not! Rory, tell me about school"
"RORY: Oh, okay, um. . .school's good."
"EMILY: Do you like student government?"
"RORY: I think so."
"EMILY: And your grades are still good?"
"RORY: Yes."
"EMILY: Do you take any sort of physical education?"
"RORY: Not this semester."
"EMILY: But eventually you will take some sort of physical education?"
"RORY: I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: But trust me  the minute she decides to run after a ball and take a public shower with thirty other girls, you are getting a call."
"EMILY: Well, thank you."
"SARAH: [enters room] Dinner's ready!"
"EMILY: Sarah, one minute please."
"SARAH: Yeah?"
"EMILY: I told you we eat dinner at seven. . .and right now, it's six-thirty. Therefore, one could conclude that maybe it's just a tad early for dinner."
"SARAH: Oh, I'm sorry, I -"
"EMILY: We want to eat at seven!"
"SARAH: But the food's ready now."
"EMILY: Okay, never mind, we'll eat. We're eating. Up, up, let's go. [they walk toward the dining room] It's fine. It's better  then we can all be in bed by nine. Sit down."
"LORELAI: Mom, tell us what is up right now."
"EMILY: What is up with what?"
"LORELAI: With you, with her, with you and her."
"EMILY: Well, she's new, Lorelai. She's only been here three days, she's still getting the hang of things. I think it's only fair to give the woman a chance. Why are you staring at me?"
"LORELAI: Mom, you've had maids deported who were better than her."
"EMILY: I have not."
"LORELAI: Talk."
"EMILY: Your father made a crack the other day about my not being able to keep a maid."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"EMILY: Of course, it's a gross exaggeration. Yes, I've had maids I haven't liked, but I've also had maids I've loved."
"LORELAI: Name one."
"EMILY: Daiha."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"EMILY: You remember, she took you shopping once."
"LORELAI: How old was I?"
"EMILY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Guess."
"EMILY: Four, five."
"LORELAI: Mom, you haven't liked a maid since I was four or five?"
"EMILY: I have liked a maid; you asked me whom I loved. I loved Daiha."
"LORELAI: And whatever happened to Daiha?"
"EMILY: Oh, how should I know? But I loved her."
"[the maid enters with some plates]"
"SARAH: Okay, so salad?"
"EMILY: Thank you, Sarah."
"[doorbell rings]"
"SARAH: Oops, big bell. [goes to answer it and takes the salad plates with her]"
"EMILY: Sarah, the salad! Sarah! Pass the wine, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You want a straw with that?"
"EMILY: You're enjoying this?"
"LORELAI: Well. . .yeah."
"[Christopher walks in]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor, I need to talk to you."
"LORELAI: Chris, what are you doing here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You won't return my calls!"
"LORELAI: Did you do this?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I knew you'd be here."
"EMILY: I did not do this."
"CHRISTOPHER: You gave me no choice."
"LORELAI: After I told you to just stay out of it!"
"EMILY: Lorelai, I did not do this!"
"LORELAI: You have to go."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm not going until you talk to me."
"[Lorelai and Christopher walk down the hallway]"
"EMILY: Christopher, Lorelai, come back here!"
"[cut to hallway]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Why won't you call me back?"
"LORELAI: Hey, there couldn't be a worst time to have this conversation."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really, because it seems to be the only time to have this conversation."
"LORELAI: Look, go home, okay? I promise I will talk to you tomorrow."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, sure, I believe that."
"LORELAI: Hey, I've never lied to you. There's no reason to doubt my word."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really? Forty-five unreturned phone calls isn't a reason?"
"LORELAI: No, it isn't."
"CHRISTOPHER: You shutting me out like this is wrong."
"LORELAI: I'm not discussing this with you here in my mother's house."
"CHRISTOPHER: You don't get to dictate this. I need to talk to you, you won't call me back, and I did what I had to do. And I'm sorry  but after all we've been through, especially over these last few months  you shutting me out is wrong. And you know what hits me the hardest, Lor?"
"LORELAI: Apparently it isn't the door on your way out."
"CHRISTOPHER: You keeping Rory from me."
"LORELAI: What?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I never, ever thought you'd do that."
"LORELAI: I'm not keeping Rory from you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh really? Then why hasn't she called me back, huh? I mean, no matter where you and I have been in our lives, my daughter has always called me back  until now."
"LORELAI: Hey, listen to me "
"[Rory walks up to them]"
"RORY: I didn't call you back because I didn't want to. Me  Mom had nothing to do with it."
"LORELAI: Okay, honey, calm down."
"RORY: You promised me. You promised me at Sookie's wedding that this was going to work, that you were going to be there, you promised me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Honey, please understand "
"RORY: No, I always understand, and I don't wanna understand! I don't even really wanna talk about this right now. I've got Mom, that's all I need. Go be somebody else's dad!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Don't say that."
"RORY: I'm going upstairs. Call me when he's gone. [goes upstairs]"
"CHRISTOPHER: She did not get there by herself."
"LORELAI: Hey, have you ever met your daughter? She could get anywhere by herself! She could get to the third dimension by herself! She was helping the crossing guard when she was four."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm going to talk to her."
"LORELAI: No, you're not. She wants to be alone and cool off. Respect that. I'll talk to her later."
"CHRISTOPHER: You'll talk to her, great. That makes me feel a whole lot better."
"LORELAI: Okay, you need to leave, right now."
"CHRISTOPHER: This isn't right. She needs her father."
"LORELAI: I know she needs her father, I've been telling her she needs her father! But she feels like her father bailed on her and she's mad and hurt, and I can't change that in three minutes!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Do you think I like this situation?"
"LORELAI: Oh God."
"CHRISTOPHER: Do you? I mean, after what you and I had going and now "
"LORELAI: Chris, do you remember why we're here right now? What event in your life caused this very pleasant moment we're sharing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: That has nothing to do with this."
"LORELAI: Oh  it  what? Chris, man! What do you want from me?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I wanna talk!"
"LORELAI: About what?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I don't know. I just. . . I don't like how things are."
"LORELAI: But that's how they are!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I didn't want things to turn out this way!"
"LORELAI: But they did turn out this way!"
"CHRISTOPHER: But I didn't want that!"
"LORELAI: Christopher, is Sherry still pregnant?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Of course she is."
"LORELAI: Are you still with her?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Are you gonna marry her?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Then, honey, we are where we are! Accept it."
"CHRISTOPHER: I can't."
"LORELAI: Don't you understand that I can't talk to you because it hurts talking to you, really hurts! Standing here right now is k*ll me, okay? Don't you understand that?"
"EMILY: Christopher, I think you'd better go now."
"CHRISTOPHER: Emily, I . . ."
"EMILY: Leave now, please."
"[Christopher leaves]"
"LORELAI: You know, you need a mask and a horse when you do that."
"EMILY: Something's burning."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Christopher is sitting on his motorcycle as Lorelai walks out of the house]"
"LORELAI: Chris? Give it time."
"[Christopher nods and drives away]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Rory and Lorelai walk down the sidewalk]"
"LORELAI: Well, now, that was a fun night."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: I haven't had that much fun since labor."
"RORY: Ba-dum-bum."
"LORELAI: But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, is this on?"
"RORY: I can't believe he just came over."
"LORELAI: He misses you."
"RORY: He misses you."
"LORELAI: We're very missable. Honey, he loves you so much, he didn't mean to mess "
"RORY: No, he never means to, but he does. And I don't care what he says or does, I'm not going to this wedding."
"LORELAI: You don't have to."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: But you might, at a later point in your life, when you're not so angry and you make up with your dad, as we both know you will, you might be sorry you missed it."
"RORY: It's the wrong wedding."
"LORELAI: Ah, things happen for a reason."
"RORY: Since when is that your philosophy."
"LORELAI: Since now. By the way, I'm also a communist."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes, cause I look damn good in red."
"RORY: I'm starving."
"LORELAI: Really? Could it be cause dinner sucked?"
"RORY: Could be."
"LORELAI: Let's do mac and cheese."
"RORY: And tater tots"
"LORELAI: And those little pizza rolls."
"RORY: Oh, and chili beef soup."
"LORELAI: After which we will install our own vomitorium."
"RORY: Okay, nix the soup."
"LORELAI: And add some cake. Okay, let's be organized  make it fast, make it snappy, and if there's any impulse buying, make it chocolate."
"RORY: Aye aye, captain."
"KIRK: [calls from down the street] Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Oh no. Go on in."
"RORY: Are you sure?"
"LORELAI: I have to take care of this."
"RORY: Good luck."
"[Rory goes into the market as Kirk walks up to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk."
"KIRK: Lorelai, I know you haven't made up your mind yet, and I'm not here for an answer. I just need to know  are you allergic to tuna?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"KIRK: No, good. Thank you very much."
"LORELAI: Uh, Kirk, I have made up my mind."
"KIRK: You have?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"KIRK: Already?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"KIRK: And it's fully formed?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"KIRK: You don't need any other information?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't."
"KIRK: Cause I could have my mother call you if "
"LORELAI: Totally unnecessary."
"KIRK: Okay, well, then, go ahead."
"LORELAI: I just got out of a really weird relationship, and I know that sounds like a line, but it isn't. I'm just not. . .fully over the shock of it yet, and I never wanna hurt you because you're my friend and I like you, so I have to say no. I'm sorry."
"KIRK: Was the tuna inquiry too personal?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I thought it was very thoughtful"
"KIRK: You're sure you won't feel like it anytime soon?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'm sure."
"KIRK: Well, at least I asked. Goodnight Lorelai."
"CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Rory walks into an aisle and sees Jess]"
"JESS: Doing a little shopping?"
"RORY: Yes. Excuse me."
"JESS: Why the cold shoulder?"
"RORY: No cold shoulder. I just have perishables here."
"JESS: Oh yeah, you wanna get home before that beefaroni goes bad."
"RORY: My mom's waiting for me."
"JESS: How was Washington?"
"RORY: Fine."
"JESS: Do anything interesting?"
"RORY: Nope."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: What about you?"
"JESS: What about me?"
"RORY: Anything interesting happen? This summer, I mean."
"JESS: Nope."
"RORY: Really?"
"JESS: Really."
"RORY: So nothing happened this summer, at all?"
"JESS: It was hot. Two weeks ago there was a run on snowcones. Machine broke, people went crazy, Taylor tried to call in the National Guard, but "
"RORY: I'm not talking about snowcones."
"JESS: What are you talking about then?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"JESS: Her name's Shane."
"RORY: As in come back'?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: Well, great. That's great. Really, it's great."
"JESS: So I've heard."
"RORY: Well, it is."
"JESS: Are you upset about something?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: I mean, me and Shane "
"RORY: What about you and Shane?"
"JESS: I don't know, it didn't exactly bring a smile to your face."
"RORY: Well, I'm still freaked out about the, uh, snowcone machine."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: I could care less about you and Shane."
"JESS: Good."
"RORY: It just surprised me, that's all."
"JESS: Why?"
"RORY: Because."
"JESS: Because why?"
"RORY: Because of what happened at Sookie's wedding."
"JESS: Ah."
"RORY: Yeah, so me coming back here and just seeing you with Shane just kind of threw me for a sec."
"JESS: I'm sorry, did I hear from you at all this summer? Did I just happen to miss the thousands of phone calls you made to me, or did the postman happen to lose all those letters you wrote to me? You kiss me, you tell me not to say anything. . .very flattering, by the way. You go off to Washington. . . then nothing. Then you come back here all put out because I didn't just sit around and wait for you like Dean would've done? And yeah, what about Dean? Are you still with him? 'Cause last time I checked, you were, and I haven't heard anything to the contrary. Plus, the two of you walking around the other day like some damn Andy Hardy movie. Seemed to me like you're still pretty together. I half expected you to break into a barn and put on a show."
"RORY: When did you see me with Dean?"
"JESS: At that stupid summer insanity plea the town put on."
"RORY: Oh, I'm surprised you could see anything with Shane's head plastered to your face."
"JESS: You didn't answer me."
"RORY: About what?"
"JESS: Did you call me at all?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Did you send me a letter?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Postcard?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Smoke signal?"
"RORY: Stop."
"JESS: A nice fruit basket?"
"RORY: Enough!"
"JESS: Are you still with Dean? Come on, Rory, yes or no  are you still with Dean?"
"RORY: Yes, I'm still with Dean, yes!"
"JESS: Glad to hear it."
"RORY: Glad to tell you."
"JESS: See you around."
"RORY: Whatever."
"JESS: Right back at ya."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory walks out of the market with a bag of groceries]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I was just gonna come in after you. You all done?"
"RORY: Oh yeah, I'm done."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are on the sofa watching ""The Brady Bunch Variety Hour""]"
"RORY: This is sublime."
"LORELAI: It was the golden age of television."
"RORY: The music, the costumes, the sets."
"LORELAI: All cylinders were fired on this one, boy!"
"RORY: And who knew that they all had such musical talent?"
"LORELAI: And such far out booty shaking abilities, as well."
"[The mailman walks through the front door and sets the mail on the bench]"
"EDDIE: Mail, ladies."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Eddie!"
"[Eddie walks back out; Rory walks over to get the mail]"
"RORY: Did you see that TV Guide had this on their list of the worst fifty shows of all time?"
"LORELAI: I know! Who are they to judge?"
"RORY: I know, it's on my top fifty best."
"LORELAI: Yeah, right after ""Holmes and Yoyo"" and ""Hee Haw Honeys."" Oh, Rory, get back here! They're in clown suits and headed for the pool."
"RORY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Honey, come here."
"RORY: It's here."
"LORELAI: What's here?"
"RORY: My application to Harvard."
"LORELAI: Oh my God. [walks over to look at it] It's beautiful."
"RORY: Impressive letterage, huh?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, it's so. . ."
"RORY: Very."
"LORELAI: Can I hold it?"
"RORY: Be careful."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's heavy, heavy with importance."
"RORY: I feel dizzy."
"LORELAI: Are you sure that's not just the sight of Robert Reed in the tight clown pants?"
"RORY: Oh, geez. Let the record show that when my application to Harvard arrived, we were watching ""The Brady Bunch Variety Hour."""
"LORELAI: You don't lose points for that, do you?"
"RORY: I hope not. Man, this morning I was reading Dead Souls  it couldn't have come then?"
"LORELAI: Well, we'll just tell people that's what you were doing, and that I was studying a really big globe. They'll never know."
"RORY: You can keep a secret?"
"LORELAI: Not so far, but there's always a first."
"RORY: Dead Souls and a really big globe."
"LORELAI: Deal. [looks at TV] Oh, kayaks!"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai sits at the table with the Harvard application while Rory gets a drink from the refrigerator]"
"LORELAI: Come on, come on, I wanna get started."
"RORY: Hold your horses there little Miss Horsie Holder."
"LORELAI: They're going to expect a higher level of wit when you're at Harvard. Oh, watch that drink."
"RORY: I'm nowhere near it."
"LORELAI: Well, keep it that way. This is an uncontaminated area. I even cleaned the table using something other than the sleeve of my sweater and spit. [shows her a bottle of cleanser]"
"RORY: Lovely image. I'll be careful."
"LORELAI: All right, here we go. First question. Uh! Oh my God."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: ""What were you doing the moment you received this application?"" counts for fifty percent of your eligibility."
"RORY: Stop."
"[Lane walks out of Rory's bedroom]"
"LANE: I need help."
"LORELAI: With what?"
"RORY: She's writing her drummer-seeks-rock-band ad."
"LANE: And it's not reading right to me. Could you guys look it over?"
"RORY: Let's see  ""Drummer with strong b*at seeks band into the Accelerators, the Adolescents, the Adverts, Agent Orange, the Angelic Upstarts, the Agnostic Front, Ash. . ."" You went alphabetically."
"LANE: Seemed tidy."
"LORELAI: And a little OCD."
"RORY: And a little long."
"LANE: I can't make cuts."
"RORY: It's three pages, single spaced  make cuts."
"LANE: But this is the cut-down version. I mean, just from the letter A, I excluded AC/DC, the Animals, and A-Ha, footnoted as a guilty pleasure."
"RORY: If we can't get through it, no one can."
"LANE: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"LANE: I'll try to make cuts, but no guarantees. [goes back into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Okay, personal information. . . state your full name. Better not get that one wrong."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: And nickname, if any."
"RORY: That would be Rory."
"LORELAI: Or Droopy Drawers."
"RORY: That was never my nickname."
"LORELAI: Wrong, I called you that as a baby."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: That's right. You had these little OshKosh cords and they were way too big and once at the mall, they fell right down to your knees and I said, ""Whoa, there, Droopy Drawers!""  and I'm just afraid if we don't answer everything accurately, the Harvard police will come and hit you with an atlas and say something mean in Latin."
"RORY: How would they know that you called me Droopy Drawers?"
"LORELAI: Well, we could be at a Harvard event and I could slip up and say, ""Pass me a lobster puff, Droopy Drawers,"" and they could hear me, and that'll be that."
"RORY: How bout you don't drink at any of these Harvard events?"
"LORELAI: Okay, parental information. Mother  breathtaking."
"RORY: I think they just want your name."
"LORELAI: Father  ostracized. Personal statement."
"RORY: Oh, the essay  the big kahuna."
"LORELAI: You can evaluate a significant experience that's had an impact on you. How bout that time your drawers dropped at the mall?"
"RORY: Enough with the drawers."
"LORELAI: Or you can write about a person who has had a significant influence on you."
"RORY: You?"
"LORELAI: Or one of your authors, Faulkner or. . ."
"RORY: Or Sylvia Plath."
"LORELAI: Hm, might send the wrong message."
"RORY: The sticking her head in the oven thing?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Although she did make her kids a snack first, shows a certain maternal instinct."
"[Lane walks out of Rory's bedroom]"
"LANE: Okay, I just crunched the numbers and at two thousand words and twenty-five cents a word, this stupid ad's gonna cost five hundred dollars! That's five months worth of Minwaxing end tables at my mom's store. I give up."
"RORY: No, don't give up. Just cut down your influences to the most important ones, like with David Bowie."
"LANE: Gotta have Bowie."
"RORY: But do you have to list every album he ever recorded plus your personal rating between one to ten?"
"LANE: Maybe not."
"LORELAI: And what's with Jackson Browne making the list?"
"LANE: Ah, see, cool people know that he's more than a mellow hippie-dippy folkie, that he actually wrote some of Nico's best songs and was in fact her lover before he bored us with ""Doctor My Eyes."" That will separate the poseurs from the non-poseurs."
"RORY: Wax on, wax off."
"LANE: I hate this. [goes back into bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Okay, what activities interest you?"
"RORY: All of them except for the sports."
"LORELAI: I thought you were the lacrosse kid."
"RORY: Mom, just a modicum of seriousness as we do this would be much appreciated."
"LORELAI: Hm, so, circle all of them except sports. Oh, they want a picture. How about the one of us sticking our heads through the carved out holes of Johnny Bravo and SpongeBob Squarepants?"
"RORY: There's the seriousness I crave."
"[Lane opens the bedroom door]"
"LANE: I'm going to have to crank the Ramones if I have to make deep cuts."
"[Lane shuts the door, and a second later, music starts blaring from the room]"
"RORY: We'll move outside."
"LORELAI: The outside's contaminated."
"[Rory grabs the bottle of cleanser and they walk out the back door]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Dean and Rory are sitting at a table. Luke refills Rory's coffee mug]"
"RORY: Thank you."
"LUKE: Do they let kids drink coffee before school?"
"RORY: Why, do you think it might lead to harder stuff? Lattes, cappucinos. . ."
"LUKE: Forget I asked. [walks away]"
"RORY: So, what are you doing Saturday?"
"DEAN: Just my usual chores."
"RORY: Your usual chores, John-boy?"
"DEAN: Well, what else do you call house jobs?"
"RORY: I call them the stuff you avoid until the Environmental Protection Agency steps in."
"DEAN: Why do you ask?"
"RORY: I thought we could see a movie or something."
"DEAN: You're not free."
"RORY: How do you know?"
"DEAN: Cause you'll be working on your application all weekend."
"RORY: No, I'm not."
"DEAN: Really?"
"RORY: It's not due for weeks, and I already have my essay topic picked out."
"DEAN: Which is?"
"RORY: Hillary Clinton."
"DEAN: Sounds perfect."
"RORY: I know. She's so smart and tough and nobody thought she could win New York but she did and she's doing amazing, and have you heard her speak?"
"DEAN: Only when you've played me the thousands of hours of C-SPAN footage you taped."
"RORY: She's a great speaker, strong and persuasive with a wonderful presence, and even those suits of hers are getting better."
"DEAN: I'd include that in the essay."
"RORY: Anyhow, now that I have Hillary, all I need is a date for Saturday. Suggestions?"
"DEAN: You're on."
"RORY: Great. Oh, there's my bus. Sip. [sips coffee] Kiss. [they kiss] And bye."
"DEAN: Bye."
"[Rory exits the diner and runs to catch her bus as Luke walks over to the table]"
"LUKE: Fast runner."
"DEAN: It's the coffee."
"LUKE: Not your face?"
"DEAN: Excuse me?"
"LUKE: Sorry, just missed my youth for a second. I'm back. Coffee?"
"[Luke looks out the window and sees Taylor taking photographs of the store next to the diner]"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory is waiting outside the auditorium while Paris argues with a teacher]"
"PARIS: Everyone always says that! This is my speaking voice. This is its natural volume! Fine, fine! [walks over to Rory and they walk into the auditorium]"
"PARIS: Short-sighted morons."
"RORY: What now, Paris?"
"PARIS: We went to all this trouble to set up this stupid seminar. I say we, but let's face it, I did most of the work, and Mr. Hunter won't let me do it the way I want."
"RORY: The panelists are up there. We sit across from them and ask questions. What's the problem?"
"PARIS: It's boring and predictable and done to death. I wanted Charlie Rose."
"RORY: To ask the questions?"
"PARIS: His style. I wanted us sitting at a round table with black backdrops."
"RORY: But the audience won't be able to see anything."
"PARIS: I was working with the losers in the AV club to project it on a giant video screen. And all Mr. Hunter said was, ""Paris, this isn't the b*at at Shea Stadium."" Nice anachronism, huh? Like they had video screens in sixty-three. His references are as topical as his suits."
"MR. HUNTER: [on stage] Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? We can get this seminar started. I'd like to bring up the organizers of this little event, Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore."
"[There are two tables on the stage. A man and a woman are seated at one of them; Rory and Paris walk on stage and sit at the other]"
"PARIS: Thank you, Mr. Hunter. Everybody, this is a seminar called ""The Business of Getting In."" Its goal is to help guide us through the torturous process of applying to, and getting into, the right college. My panelists are Jim Romaine, admissions officer at Princeton University, and Ivy-League college consultant, Rose Samuels. Welcome, panel."
"RORY: Yes, welcome."
"PARIS: Now, panel, you're addressing a group of kids just beginning the stressful process of applying to college. Question  what is the biggest mistake a person can make on his or her application? Mr. Romaine?"
"MR. ROMAINE: Well, forgetting to send it in would be the worst mistake, but perfunctory answers would be high on my list."
"PARIS: Explain."
"MR. ROMAINE: I'm talking about run of the mill responses, a lack of originality, particularly in the essay category. If I read one more over-adulating piece of prose about Hillary Clinton and her profound influence, my head will explode."
"MS. SAMUELS: I hear that. Sometimes a mistake like that comes from writing what one thinks an admission officer wants to read."
"MR. ROMAINE: Big mistake."
"MS. SAMUELS: And sometimes it's just a lack of original thought."
"MR. ROMAINE: Just as big a mistake."
"PARIS: Personal anecdote  when I was twelve and I was writing the first of my trial essays in practice for the day I'd write my real essay, I chose Hillary Clinton. Then I realized every braindead bint in a skirt would be writing about Hillary, but it was good to clear the pipes. Now, what are some other mistakes?"
"MR. ROMAINE: Well, small thing, but if your printing is bad, that says something we don't like. If your extracurriculars and volunteer activities are too by-the-book, that says something we don't like."
"MS. SAMUELS: Yes, those activities should have a personality behind them  a focus, a direction. I've seen applications where the student has circled every activity listed. Again, you're trying too hard there. One can't be interested in everything."
"MR. ROMAINE: They're the ones who've had college paraphernalia on their walls their whole lives."
"MS. SAMUELS: Too hungry, it's a little immature."
"PARIS: Interesting, interesting. Rory, do you wanna ask a question?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: No, thank you."
"PARIS: Okay. So, how early should a student get an application in?"
"MR. ROMAINE: By the due date. Earlier makes no difference. It's a complete myth that there's a benefit to be derived from early admission. I do think it's important to talk about the interview process. I believe it's an opportunity to weed out the hyper-intense candidate. . ."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Emily walk into the living room]"
"EMILY: So, she's meeting you here?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she had a thing after school, a rumble or something. She said she'd be over after."
"EMILY: A rumble?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, a bunch of kids meet in an alley, they pirouette, they pull knives, it's a whole to-do."
"EMILY: So she's meeting you here?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she's meeting us here. Where's Dad?"
"EMILY: The magazines. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: That was weird. . .and unresponsive."
"[Lorelai walks over to the couch as Emily returns with a stack of magazines]"
"EMILY: These are college issues of various magazines. I've been collecting them for a couple of months now."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, Rory's probably seen all those, but thanks anyway."
"EMILY: Have you read these?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Well, you should. I've unearthed some shocking statistics. I mean, do you have any idea how hot the competition is to get into a school like Harvard?"
"LORELAI: Well, yeah, it's very hot. It's one of the top schools in the country."
"EMILY: In the world. People from China, Russia, India, children from every country apply to Harvard. There's more competition than ever before."
"LORELAI: Really, Mom, I know all this."
"EMILY: With the dot-com bust and the job market dwindling and the stock market going up and down like a yo-yo, everyone and his brother knows the best chance for success and financial security is not just to go to college, but to go to a top college."
"LORELAI: Thank you, got it, appreciate the info."
"EMILY: Every child that applies has the same high grade point average, they've taken the same AP classes, and they're all on the student council."
"LORELAI: They're not all that identical."
"EMILY: One college admissions officer said that he sometimes puts a random stack of applications in the yes pile and the rest in the no pile because he knows it doesn't make any difference. He doesn't even so much as glance at them."
"LORELAI: That does not sound real."
"EMILY: And now it's the in thing for young Hollywood celebrities to go to universities. What do they call themselves, the Brat Pack?"
"LORELAI: About a hundred years ago."
"EMILY: They get into wherever they want based on name recognition. I was watching TV and that insipid Kate Hudson was talking about going to a university. If she decides to go to Harvard, she'll get right in over Rory, who we know is more qualified."
"LORELAI: How bout a drink, Mom? You want a drink, cause I sure do."
"EMILY: Lorelai, hold on here. What are we gonna do about this?"
"LORELAI: Look, there is no we, okay? It's me  me and Rory  that's the we. I appreciate your concern and your prodigious research, but it's all gonna be fine. Rory's special."
"EMILY: Well, you know that and I know that but those idiots at Harvard may not necessarily know that."
"RORY: [calls from hallway] Hello?"
"LORELAI: Uh, we're in here, honey, and hurry!"
"[Rory walks into the living room]"
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: Hello Rory. You look flushed."
"RORY: I ran from the bus stop, I'm okay. Mom, hey, I've been trying to call you  can I talk to you for a second?"
"EMILY: Is something wrong?"
"RORY: No, I just need to talk to Mom about something, that's all. We'll be quick."
"LORELAI: Okay, hon. We'll be back."
"CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY"
"[Rory and Lorelai walk in]"
"RORY: I'm not getting into Harvard."
"LORELAI: What? Who says?"
"RORY: Well, I'm completely unprepared, and I have no original thoughts!"
"LORELAI: No, no, don't blame yourself, it's not you. It's those jerks at Harvard  I hate them!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, apparently, it doesn't matter how qualified you are, those lazy-ass admissions officers just take applications and stick it in the yes and no piles without even glancing at them!"
"RORY: Well, it won't matter because my Hillary Clinton essay will be just like every other girl's Hillary Clinton essay because apparently that's all we can think of. I'm such a hack."
"LORELAI: Is it true everyone has the same GPA? How is that possible?"
"RORY: Because we all take the same classes and we all give the same perfunctory run-of-the-mill responses. And I'm interested in too many things, I have to limit them. I'm gonna circle travel on my application. From now on, that is what I am interested in, travel."
"LORELAI: No, no, don't do that, no! Because all those people coming from China and India and God knows where else, they're all nuts for traveling  that's why they're traveling here! Andand jobs are dropping and dot-com b*mb and something's acting like a yo-yo, I don't know what but it's not good! And over my dead body is Kate Hudson getting your spot, let me just say that right now!"
"RORY: Mom, you're freaking out!"
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm freaking out!"
"RORY: Well, you can't freak out, I'm freaking out! [cell phone rings] Hello?"
"PARIS: What the hell did Romaine mean when he was going on about weeding out the hyper-intense in the interview process? He stopped just short of calling me by name, I'm losing it!"
"RORY: Not now, Paris."
"PARIS: I tried to throw the questioning over to you because I was about to heave and you left me hanging so I had to come home and heave."
"RORY: I'll talk to you tomorrow, Paris. [hangs up]"
"PARIS: Wait!"
"LORELAI: Okay, we gotta calm down here."
"RORY: So, set an example."
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm human, too."
"RORY: My forehead is burning up."
"LORELAI: My heart is b*at so fast, it's gotta slow down."
"RORY: Okay, just. . .let's take a breath."
"LORELAI: Okay. This freaking out is not good."
"RORY: It sucks."
"LORELAI: We can do this. If others can do this, we can do this!"
"RORY: Well, I'm not so sure anymore."
"LORELAI: That is unacceptable!"
"RORY: Well, I don't wanna accept it."
"LORELAI: Then we won't."
"RORY: Well, what do we do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. We definitely need some sort of perspective."
"RORY: I think we need therapy."
"LORELAI: And booze! For those of us over twenty-one. Okay, are we calming? Are we less-freaked?"
"RORY: I'm totally freaked out."
"LORELAI: Well, hide it!"
"RORY: I can't hide it."
"LORELAI: Then prepare yourself for an evening of magazine recitations by Emily ""DJ Doom-meister"" Gilmore."
"RORY: I'll hide it."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is making coffee in the kitchen when the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello? . . . No, Lane should be here any minute. Is this about the ad? . . . Well, uh, give me your number and she'll call you back. . . Okay, then, what's the number of the dude whose couch you're sleeping on? . . .Uh! Dude doesn't have a phone? Well, try back later, dude. Thanks. [hangs up] Rory, are you up? If not, get up! [phone rings again] And where's Lane? She's supposed to be fielding these. [answers phone] Hello? No, she's not, may I take a message? [Lane walks in through the back door] Oh, wait a minute  here she is, hold on. [holds out the phone toward Lane]"
"LANE: Sorry. [answers phone] This is Lane. [walks out of kitchen]"
"[Rory walks out of her bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Aw, what's up?"
"RORY: I didn't sleep so well."
"LORELAI: Poor thing."
"RORY: I'm fine. I'm just a little bummed."
"LANE: [on phone] No, wait, wait, wait, progressive rock is a really passé style now but I listed it as an influence because it was a progenitor of great things that came afterwards. I mean, I contend that you can draw a straight line from Yes to Jethro Tull to the Jam to Nirvana, bing bang boom. . . Who are the Jam? [to Rory and Lorelai] That's disturbing. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Hey, maybe instead of going to college, you should drop out and I could quit my job and we can form an all-girl band with Lane, you know, like Bananarama. We could call it Tangerinarama or Banana-fana-fo-fana-rama. . .or something. Honey, I'm just kidding, you gotta go to college."
"RORY: I'm up for anything at this point. I gotta go. I'll see you later?"
"LORELAI: Feel better, okay?"
"RORY: I will."
"LANE: You are not telling me that you did not know that Kim Deal was in the Pixies before the Breeders! I refuse to accept that! [hangs up] These kids have no sense of history."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke walks up to a customer at the counter]"
"LUKE: Hey Tom, what's up?"
"TOM: Nothing much. Why don't you get me a ham on rye, mustard, no mayo."
"LUKE: You got it."
"[A young boy walks up to the counter]"
"BOY: Hi."
"LUKE: You got money?"
"BOY: Yes, sir."
"LUKE: What can I get ya?"
"BOY: Let's see. How about a nice, cold egg cream?"
"LUKE: A what cream?"
"BOY: An egg cream. A nice and cold one."
"LUKE: What is that?"
"TOM: It's like, uh, milk and soda water with flavoring, isn't it?"
"LUKE: You asking me?"
"BOY: Nice and cold."
"LUKE: I heard that part."
"TOM: Used to get them at Coney Island."
"LUKE: Go to Coney Island, kid."
"[The boy leaves, and another boy walks up to the counter]"
"BOY: Sir, can I get something to go?"
"LUKE: You got money?"
"BOY: Uh huh."
"LUKE: What do you want?"
"BOY: A black cow."
"LUKE: Aw, now, come on."
"BOY: It's just root beer and ice cream."
"LUKE: Root beer and ice cream?"
"BOY: Uh huh."
"LUKE: Well, I can do that."
"BOY: As long as the ice cream's made the old fashioned way  on the premises."
"LUKE: Now wait a second."
"[Kirk walks up to the counter]"
"KIRK: Hey, Luke, can you whip me up something in a hurry?"
"LUKE: What, Kirk?"
"KIRK: A chocolate phosphate."
"LUKE: Okay, now, what the hell is this? Why do you want a phosphate?"
"KIRK: Because nothing says refreshment like a phosphate."
"LUKE: This is Taylor, right? Is he behind this?"
"KIRK: I'm not at liberty to say."
"LUKE: [to boy] Okay, then, you tell me. And remember, if you lie, you'll go to hell."
"BOY: He didn't say you'd get mad."
"LUKE: Come on."
"[Luke drags Kirk and the boy out of the diner]"
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Luke pulls Kirk and the boy into the market]"
"TAYLOR: What is this?"
"LUKE: That's my question. Now what the hell's going on here?"
"TAYLOR: I have no idea what you're talking about."
"LUKE: They're asking for phosphates and egg creams and black cows, and they already gave you up, so tell me what's going on."
"TAYLOR: Who finked?"
"KIRK: Him, him."
"BOY: Snitch!"
"KIRK: Well, you did."
"LUKE: It's not the kid's fault, Taylor. Now what is this about?"
"TAYLOR: Well, you are so close-minded to new things, Luke, that I decided to make an admittedly desperate attempt to convince you of the need for something that I think is a terrific idea."
"LUKE: Which is?"
"TAYLOR: An old fashioned, turn of the century soda shop!"
"LUKE: Aye yi yi yi yi!"
"TAYLOR: It's just the kind of wholesome hang today's teens need to keep them off the streets."
"LUKE: And our streets are so wild and out of control?"
"TAYLOR: If you ask me, yes  and I have proof. [hands Luke an envelope of pictures]"
"LUKE: What are these?"
"TAYLOR: Surveillance photos of town goings-on, the dark side of Stars Hollow, Luke  not a pretty picture."
"LUKE: These are kids on skateboards."
"TAYLOR: Slaloming around pop bottles right down the middle of the street. I'm telling you, Luke, if we don't quick furnish these skateboarding z-boys with a moral distraction, they're gonna turn Stars Hollow into Dogtown."
"LUKE: [points to a picture] This is the space next to the diner."
"TAYLOR: I know."
"LUKE: I own the space next to the diner."
"TAYLOR: I know."
"LUKE: You wanna open the soda shop in the space next to the diner?"
"TAYLOR: It's the only one that's appropriate."
"LUKE: Taylor, no, no, no, no, and every day from now on til the end of my life, I am gonna come in here and say, ""Taylor, no!"" And when I die, I'm gonna have them freeze me next to Ted Williams, and when they find the cure to what I died of and they unfreeze me, my first words are gonna be, ""How's Ted?"" followed closely by, ""Taylor, no!"""
"TAYLOR: But the space is empty!"
"LUKE: Not for long."
"TAYLOR: And what are your plans for it?"
"LUKE: A skateboard and pop bottle shop."
"TAYLOR: That's not funny."
"LUKE: With in-house experts to teach the craft of street slaloming."
"TAYLOR: Still not funny."
"LUKE: Well, I'm not in a very funny mood!"
"KIRK: Luke, are you taking applications for jobs at your skateboard and bottle shop?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm interviewing people today, Kirk."
"KIRK: Great. Shall I go home and change or will casual suffice?"
"LUKE: I like the going home part."
"KIRK: I don't understand."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch when Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey. Guess who I actually had a very productive conversation with today? Headmaster Charleston."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: No, and I think we came up with the solution to our application anxiety, you wanna hear it?"
"RORY: I guess."
"LORELAI: Well, we spent the first ten minutes on him bugging me to volunteer for more stuff at school, or in lieu of that to make a donation to build the new basketball court, and then another couple of minutes of me convincing him that what sounded like me going ""Ha!"" was really me clearing my throat, but after that we had a very pleasant, productive conversation."
"RORY: And?"
"LORELAI: He suggested setting up a meeting with a Harvard graduate, like a dinner or something. He even gave me the number of someone he knows."
"RORY: An alumni dinner?"
"LORELAI: Yes, exactly."
"RORY: Do they do that?"
"LORELAI: According to Charleston, it's done all the time."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it would be an opportunity to talk with someone who's been through it all and did it successfully. You can ask questions, he can give some perspective, it seems perfect."
"RORY: It sounds a little weird."
"LORELAI: Yeah, a little, but I'll go with you and what's the worst that can happen? We're bored and we blow a meal, but if this person can help, then that's a good thing, right?"
"RORY: I do have some questions. . . a lot of questions."
"LORELAI: Well, let's call him."
"RORY: Now?"
"LORELAI: Yes, yes, there's no time like the present, come on. [they walk over to desk] His name is Darren Springsteen of Westport, Connecticut, Harvard class of 74. Uh! Ask if he has a brother named Bruce."
"RORY: I'm not gonna ask him that. [dials phone number] It's ringing."
"LORELAI: Hee!"
"[Rory hangs up the phone]"
"LORELAI: Why'd you hang up?"
"RORY: I'm not good at these things."
"LORELAI: Did he answer?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes? Rory, that's a really terrible first impression. [phone rings] Uh oh."
"RORY: Him?"
"LORELAI: Maybe."
"RORY: He star sixty-nined us?"
"LORELAI: Well, the Harvard people can afford all the latest technology. Answer!"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, you've reached Suffragette City, and if you're calling about Lane Kim's ad, sorry we're not in, but don't commit rock and roll su1c1de  just crank a message with some feedback."
"RORY: Oh geez."
"LORELAI: Well, if he is related to Bruce, he can dig it."
"DAVE: [on machine] Hey, my name's Dave Rygalski, I'm calling about the ad. I left my number before, so call when you get a chance."
"GIRL: [in background on machine] Where's my "
"DAVE: [on machine] Relax, I'm coming."
"[Lorelai stops the message]"
"LORELAI: Let's try this again. [dials number]"
"RORY: Can we please just do this later?"
"LORELAI: No, let's get it done now. It's ringing."
"RORY: Let's do it later."
"LORELAI: It's ringing. [hands her the phone]"
"RORY: I'm gonna say the wrong thing or have the wrong tone in my voice. I'm not in good first impression mode right now. [hands phone back to Lorelai] Unh!"
"LORELAI: [answers phone in high voice] Hello? Hello, um, this is Rory Gilmore. I believe you were expecting my call. . .Um, oh, well, this is such a wonderful opportunity for me. . .Whatever's good for you will be great for me. . ."
"RORY: Not so breathy."
"LORELAI: That's how chickens talk! [on phone in high voice] Lunch? Oh yes, let me just check my organizer. . .oh, perfect. My mother will be there, too. She's terrific. . . All right, I'll see you this weekend. . . Mm, bye. [hangs up]"
"RORY: You're no Danny Gans."
"LORELAI: I never claimed to be."
"RORY: He's gonna be expecting Chilton High School senior Trixie McBimbo."
"LORELAI: And her mother, Bambi McBimbo."
"RORY: But I guess it can't hurt, right?"
"LORELAI: It can only help."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: And look, if it's a total bust, we'll grab a pole and Trixie and Bambi'll take it on the road. That's something to put on your application, huh? It'll set you apart."
"RORY: Thanks Mom."
"LORELAI: [in high voice] Bye Trixie!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE SPRINGSTEEN RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up the pathway to the house]"
"LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: And alumnus is a man."
"RORY: Singular."
"LORELAI: So an unmarried man?"
"RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural."
"LORELAI: And plural is alumni."
"RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys."
"LORELAI: Kinky!"
"RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. [rings doorbell]"
"LORELAI: Ugh, you're no fun when you're nervous."
"RORY: Oh yes, because you and I usually have so much fun with Latin."
"LORELAI: So what do we call this guy, alumnus Darren, you know, like you'd say farmer John or the butcher Lazar Wolf?"
"RORY: Hish-kabibble."
"[A man opens the door]"
"DARREN: Hello there."
"LORELAI: Hello, I'm Lorelai Gilmore."
"DARREN: Darren Springsteen, nice to meet you. And this must be the reason we're all here."
"RORY: Yes, hello. I'm hope we're not putting you out."
"DARREN: Putting us out? Today you are the Springsteen family's raison d'être. Come in, come in. [they walk inside] Was your drive long?"
"LORELAI: Not too."
"DARREN: Stars Hollow is charming. The last time we drove through there, there was a pumpkin patch."
"LORELAI: Sounds like us."
"DARREN: In March."
"LORELAI: Oh, that would be the year the pumpkins arrived late."
"DARREN: Sounds like a Dr. Seuss book. You came bearing gifts?"
"RORY: What? Oh, this. No, this is not a gift. These are my records  grades, SATs."
"LORELAI: It's Rory in a bag  you add water and her brilliance springs out."
"DARREN: Why don't I just glance at this some other time, mm? This afternoon, why don't we just talk and get to know one another, okay?"
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: You're a very nice alumni."
"DARREN: Thanks. [walks down the hall]"
"RORY: That's the plural."
"LORELAI: Ah, rats!"
"[they follow him into the living room]"
"DARREN: Lorelai, Rory, say hello to Marie, my wife."
"MARIE: Hello, so good to have you here."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Thank you."
"MARIE: How about drinks? Iced tea, water?"
"RORY: Iced tea's good."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"MARIE: Okay. [leaves room]"
"DARREN: Do you like art, Rory?"
"RORY: Very much."
"DARREN: Modern painting is my passion. I've got a Hockney, a Kline  what I don't have is a Diebenkorn so please don't ask, ""Where's the Diebenkorn?"""
"LORELAI: Uh, you warned me just in time."
"DARREN: I only recently got into sculpture. My latest acquisition, it's a Zoltan Kemeny. Very provocative. Don't you just love its audacity?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it's very audacious."
"DARREN: So, what are some of your other interests, Rory?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, pull up a comfy chair there, Darren, because they are widespread and extensive."
"RORY: I read a lot. I'm into the Russians lately."
"DARREN: Tolstoy, Turgenev?"
"RORY: Gogol is my thing right now  Dead Souls."
"DARREN: One of my favorites."
"LORELAI: You were reading that when we got your Harvard application in the mail, weren't you sweetie?"
"RORY: Yes, yes I was."
"LORELAI: I saw that Harvard logo on the envelope and I said, ""Rory, get your nose out of your Gogol and get over here!"" Of course, we have a TV somewhere, but it's really more of a funny little table to put a cup of chai tea on, you know what I mean?"
"DARREN: I'm afraid I don't. I watch way too many sports, and I go to all the Harvard games. How about you  do you like sports?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: That is, we follow certain things."
"RORY: We enjoy various aspects of certain sporting endeavors."
"LORELAI: But it wouldn't be the kind that you could ask any follow-up questions on."
"RORY: It's a general interest."
"DARREN: Got it. It's pretty much a waste of time, but it's how I waste my time. I collect memorabilia, too. I've got each year's Harvard team pennant going back to 1927."
"LORELAI: Lots of displayed Harvard paraphernalia, huh?"
"DARREN: It's all over the walls at the rec room."
"LORELAI: See, see, lots of paraphernalia."
"RORY: Watch the ribs there."
"[Two kids walk in from the backyard]"
"DARREN: Ah, here are the kids. Jack, Jennifer, this is Lorelai and Rory."
"JACK: Hi there."
"JENNIFER: It's nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Likewise."
"RORY: Hi."
"DARREN: Jack's premed at Princeton and Jennifer is bound for Harvard like you Rory."
"JENNIFER: Oh, we should talk."
"RORY: Sure."
"JENNIFER: If not today, another day, okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"JENNIFER: Uh, do you wanna pick a time now or later. . ."
"RORY: Later's fine."
"JENNIFER: I'll make a note in my palm pilot."
"RORY: Cool."
"MARIE: [enters room with a tray of drinks] Here are your teas."
"RORY: Thank you."
"MARIE: Ah, Darren, we should really get the chicken going."
"DARREN: Right, right. You're getting my famous chicken today  I hope you like chicken."
"RORY: Love it."
"DARREN: I'll be right back. Here's some of my Harvard yearbooks, peruse them if you like."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"[Marie and Darren leave the room]"
"JACK: Yeah, and we should go clean up, Jen."
"JENNIFER: Mm, definitely. [to Rory] I will see you in a jiff."
"[Jack and Jennifer leave the room]"
"LORELAI: Ew!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Did they just leave to take a shower together?"
"RORY: Oh, gross!"
"LORELAI: What? They bounced in together, they bounced out together."
"RORY: New topic."
"LORELAI: Can't take gritty reality?"
"RORY: Or slanderous postulating."
"LORELAI: And how is it they just came off the tennis court and they're not even sweating?"
"RORY: I don't know. Maybe when you're that white, you don't sweat."
"LORELAI: Darren's nice though, isn't he?"
"RORY: He's very nice. Hey, do you think I'm making a good impression?"
"LORELAI: Great impression. He loves you, especially when he found out you share his love of various aspects of certain sporting endeavors."
"RORY: Hey, you started it. We could have just told the truth and said we weren't into sports."
"LORELAI: I was trying to humanize us."
"RORY: Yeah, with our funny looking chai tea table. Very humanizing."
"LORELAI: [in robot voice] Zoltan Kemeny."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: That artist's name  it sounds like robot language, doesn't it? Zoltan Kemeny."
"RORY: Don't say it again."
"LORELAI: Zoltan Kemeny, Zoltan Kemeny."
"RORY: Stop, don't!"
"LORELAI: Zoltaaaan "
"MARIE: [enters room] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm interrupting the fun."
"LORELAI: No, that's all right, you're not. We were just laughing at all the funny haircuts, that's all."
"MARIE: I know, aren't they a blast?"
"LORELAI: It's just a sea of goofy sideburns."
"MARIE: Lunch will be ready in just a few minutes. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Zoltan."
"RORY: Stop!"
""
""
""
"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Marie and Darren walk into the room]"
"LORELAI: Aw, wow, what a beautiful table."
"RORY: Yes, you didn't have to do that."
"DARREN: Oh, Rory, honestly, it's our pleasure."
"[Jack and Jennifer walk in wearing similar outfits]"
"DARREN: Perfect timing, kids."
"JACK: Excellent."
"JENNIFER: Nice looking lunch, Mom."
"LORELAI: [to Rory] Color coordinated."
"RORY: Shh!"
"DARREN: Guests of honor, why don't you sit over there."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Aw, family pictures. You have another girl, don't you?"
"MARIE: Yes, we do."
"LORELAI: Well, where is she? What does she do?"
"DARREN: Oh, um. . ."
"MARIE: She's not here."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked."
"DARREN: Oh, no no, it's all right. That's Carol. She's a year ahead of Rory. She's. . ."
"MARIE: She's following her own path."
"DARREN: Right. Carol's doing her own thing."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"DARREN: Well, let's eat everybody. Honored guests, please choose from the chicken first."
"RORY: Thank you very much."
"DARREN: [to his kids] You two are gonna have to fight over the breast as you always do. So, Lorelai, what's your alma matter?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was too preoccupied to go to college, what with weighing a couple hundred pounds and having feet twice my normal size and all."
"DARREN: I see."
"RORY: But she took night classes and graduated last year. She has an AA degree in business."
"MARIE: Well, that's wonderful."
"DARREN: In fact, it's refreshing. It might even be to Rory's benefit. Good things didn't come to your family in one fell swoop, you struggled for it."
"LORELAI: That's true."
"DARREN: One fell swoop, interesting phrase."
"JACK: Very."
"DARREN: Origin?"
"JACK: It was coined in MacBeth and derives from Middle English."
"DARREN: Very good, son. You know your Shakespeare then, do you?"
"JACK: More than most."
"DARREN: In which play does Falstaff appear?"
"JACK: That would be plays."
"DARREN: Mm."
"JACK: Henry the Fourth, part one and two, and The Merry Wives of Windsor."
"DARREN: So that was a different Falstaff than Henry the Fifth?"
"JACK: Aw, sh**t!"
"DARREN: This is a little tradition with us, quizzes at meals. It keeps the Springsteens sharp."
"LORELAI: Very Kennedy-esque."
"JENNIFER: Mm, we love the Kennedys!"
"LORELAI: As do we all."
"DARREN: Now, the person questioned can challenge me with a follow-up if he gets his question right. Gets pretty competitive."
"LORELAI: Well, if p*stol are drawn, we're ducking."
"DARREN: Jack, which Polish composer "
"JACK: Chopin!"
"DARREN: Patience. . .became Prime Minister of his country?"
"JACK: Paderewski."
"DARREN: That's right, but your impetuousness cost you a follow-up. Jennifer, can you give me the three sub-classes of the Mesozoic Era?"
"JENNIFER: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous."
"DARREN: Good."
"JENNIFER: Follow-up  what preceded the Mesozoic Era?"
"DARREN: Paleozoic."
"LORELAI: He's good."
"MARIE: It's hard to stump Darren."
"JENNIFER: Impossible, he's brilliant."
"DARREN: Open question  which mythological figure has the head of a man, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion? Here's a hint  it's also the title of a novel by Robertson Davies."
"RORY: Oh, Manticore."
"DARREN: Very good, Rory."
"JACK: Yes, very good, Rory."
"JENNIFER: Yes, very good, Rory."
"MARIE: More water, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Please, thank you."
"DARREN: Do you know which French city famous for its water was the capital of collaborationist France?"
"LORELAI: Oh, me? Um, Evian, Perrier, uh, Le Crystal Geyser?"
"DARREN: Jennifer, you wanna help Lorelai out?"
"JENNIFER: Vichy."
"DARREN: That's correct."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's right. Vichy water, I knew that."
"DARREN: What about the year of Germany's victory in the Franco-Prussian w*r?"
"LORELAI: Huh, me again?"
"DARREN: If you wish."
"LORELAI: I don't know that one. I do know Instanbul is Constantinople, so if you've got a date in Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Instanbul."
"DARREN: That's true."
"RORY: You know, um, sorry to interrupt, but I'd like to wash my hands."
"DARREN: Our fault, we rushed you in here."
"MARIE: Our downstairs is being remodeled, you have to use upstairs. End of the hall."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Hurry back."
"RORY: I will. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: So, that painting there, wow. The colors are so great, I can't stop staring at it. It's just beautiful."
"DARREN: It is. It's by a student of Matisse. I think he caught the master's colors wonderfully."
"LORELAI: Oh, Matisse, love him."
"DARREN: I think only a charlatan wouldn't. Anyone know the artistic movement Matisse championed and referred to as the Wild Beast?"
"JENNIFER: Oh, fauvism!"
"DARREN: Correct."
"JENNIFER: Follow up?"
"DARREN: And then we'll go round robin."
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS"
"[Rory stops outside a bedroom when she hears music inside. A girl rushes past her and goes into the bedroom]"
"CAROL: Coming through!"
"RORY: Oh, sorry. I just heard music and . . . [follows her into the bedroom] Cool room."
"CAROL: Tom Waits."
"RORY: What?"
"CAROL: The music."
"RORY: Oh, I thought so. I love him."
"CAROL: I worship him. I even mildly stalked him once."
"RORY: Really?"
"CAROL: Last year, I heard he was staying at this hotel so I went there everyday and sat in the lobby drinking massive amounts of coffee waiting for him to walk by."
"RORY: Did you see him?"
"CAROL: Nope, never came down. For all I know, he's still there. Hand me that brush?"
"RORY: Oh, here."
"CAROL: Stupid manager made me cover for Fiona today. That girl's a major pie crust. Ears?"
"RORY: What?"
"CAROL: On the chair. What time is it?"
"RORY: Um, three. [hands her a pair of bunny ears]"
"CAROL: Oh, totally late for my next job. Oh well, guess Grandma had to take another trip to the emergency room, right? Are they on straight?"
"RORY: I think so."
"CAROL: Good. Who are you?"
"RORY: I'm sorry, I'm Rory Gilmore."
"CAROL: You're one of the Harvard bound?"
"RORY: Yeah. At least, I hope so."
"CAROL: [starts pulling on a bunny costume] Oh, trust me, you are. You've got that really good, straight, shiny Harvard hair. Zip me up?"
"RORY: I'm sorry, are you Carol?"
"CAROL: Yeah, why?"
"RORY: I don't know, I just didn't expect. . ."
"CAROL: What?"
"RORY: Well, you."
"CAROL: Why?"
"RORY: I don't know. Your parents just made it sound like. . ."
"CAROL: Like I was holed up in the Chelsea with a needle sticking out of my arm screaming Sid at the top of my lungs?"
"RORY: Kind of."
"CAROL: Well, to them, this is pretty close."
"RORY: Can I ask you what exactly you are dressing up like this for?"
"CAROL: Morgan Tanner's fourth birthday party."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"CAROL: Nope, this is my fifth birthday party this week. Great tips, all cash, and of course, there's cake."
"RORY: So you're a waitress and a birthday bunny and you go to school. That's pretty amazing."
"CAROL: I don't go to school."
"RORY: Oh, sorry, I just assumed. I mean, your family . . ."
"CAROL: My brother and sister got stuck on that conveyor belt. I, however, escaped somewhere around the eleventh grade, thank God."
"RORY: Huh."
"CAROL: Oh, hey, but no offense. I mean, that's just me. If you like being on the conveyor belt, then good for you."
"RORY: I'm not on the conveyor belt."
"CAROL: Okay."
"RORY: I'm not. I want this. I've dreamt of going to Harvard since I was a little girl."
"CAROL: Yeah, a lot of four year olds dream of that. It comes right after meeting Harry Potter."
"RORY: Hey, I am not gonna justify myself to someone with a tail."
"CAROL: You're right, I'm sorry. It's just that around here the Harvard brainwashing starts in the womb. If you were to tell either of my siblings that there was another life choice outside of the Ivy League, I think their khakis would wrinkle."
"RORY: Well, maybe they really want it."
"CAROL: Nope, my parents want it and they wanna please my parents. Have you seen a carrot?"
"RORY: Don't you wanna please your parents?"
"CAROL: Yeah, but not at the expense of finding myself."
"RORY: Or your carrot."
"CAROL: You gotta have your carrot. So, tell me something, Harvard hair  how bad do you wanna please your parents?"
"RORY: My mom, and really bad, but it's not hard to please my mom. She's okay with anything I do. As long as I'm happy, she's good."
"CAROL: You're sure?"
"RORY: I'm very sure."
"CAROL: Then you're lucky."
"RORY: Yeah, I am lucky."
"[Lorelai walks into the room]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory, quick, uh, what are the three major Hindu deities, because I've missed four questions in a row and if I miss another one, I don't think I get dessert."
"RORY: Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu."
"LORELAI: Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. Hi other daughter."
"CAROL: Hi."
"LORELAI: And I probably shouldn't do a gesundheit joke when I say Vishnu?"
"RORY: Good thinking."
"LORELAI: Okay, thanks, bye. [leaves room]"
"RORY: Wait, I'll go with you. [to Carol] I'm glad to have met you."
"CAROL: Oh, same here. Good luck with Harvard."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Rory walks into the hallway and hugs Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Oh. . . oh. What's that for?"
"RORY: For not putting me on the conveyor belt."
"LORELAI: Yes, that was very big of me."
"RORY: You don't know."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE SPRINGSTEEN RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Darren walk out of the house]"
"RORY: Thank you so much for this, for answering all my dumb questions."
"DARREN: You asked no dumb questions, and I hope my answers sufficed."
"RORY: Definitely. Bye. [walks down the front walkway]"
"DARREN: Au revoir."
"LORELAI: Yeah, thank you so much for everything. I know it did a world of good for her."
"DARREN: She's a very impressive young lady."
"LORELAI: I wholeheartedly concur."
"DARREN: You molded her well."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I didn't mold her. Rory popped out that way."
"DARREN: You're being modest."
"LORELAI: You don't know me, do you?"
"DARREN: So long."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Darren goes back into the house as Lorelai walks over to Rory]"
"RORY: What did he say?"
"LORELAI: That you're Godlike."
"RORY: Is that all?"
"LORELAI: Oh, and that his brother Bruce Springsteen would be happy to come and play at our next party or event."
"RORY: That would be swell of Bruce."
"LORELAI: I figured your graduation party."
"RORY: I'll be very popular."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[That night, people are gathered at Miss Patty's studio for a town meeting]"
"TAYLOR: All in favor, say aye."
"EVERYONE: Aye."
"TAYLOR: All right, let the record show that the funds have been approved to close the town bank account that holds the town funds in order to open a new town funds bank account at a different banking institution."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"TAYLOR: Young ladies, in anticipation of your tardiness, we saved two seats for you right there in the back."
"LORELAI: Thanks for thinking of us, Taylor. [they walk up to sit in the front] Whew! Okay, raise your hand if you bathed in cologne."
"TAYLOR: In the interest of getting home sometime tonight, I'd like to bring up the final point of business, and that is a certain citizen's desire to open an old fashioned soda shop in town."
"LUKE: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa."
"BABETTE: Who's the guy?"
"LUKE: What other putz would wanna open up an old-fashioned soda shop?"
"TAYLOR: Dispense with the Yiddish, young man."
"LUKE: This is not a town matter, Taylor. This is a private matter between you and me which was settled when I said no."
"TAYLOR: This is a town matter because when this town is in need of a particular business to provide necessary services, it's up to the town to band together and lure it."
"LUKE: How does a stupid soda shop count as a necessary business?"
"TAYLOR: Allow me to show you something that will make you wonder how we ever lived without it. Kirk, if you will."
"[Kirk pushes a covered table in front of the podium]"
"TAYLOR: Kirk, I told you to get something decorative to cover it."
"KIRK: Well, my mom wouldn't let me use one of her nice tablecloths so I just grabbed a sheet from my hamper."
"TAYLOR: Take it off."
"[Kirk removes the sheet to reveal a miniature model of the proposed soda shop]"
"LUKE: What's that, a toy?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, it's awfully cute."
"TAYLOR: That is a professionally manufactured diorama of the proposed business."
"RORY: Wow, there's little people and everything."
"SOOKIE: They look so real."
"JACKSON: Hey, it's me holding a tiny zucchini!"
"LORELAI: Look at the horse drawn carriage."
"TAYLOR: My thought was to park it out front with the name of the business painted on the side. It's very eighteen-hundreds."
"BABETTE: The horse is taller than the front door."
"LORELAI: Way taller."
"LUKE: What are you up to, Taylor? Are you breeding giant horses?"
"TAYLOR: It's slightly out of proportion."
"BABETTE: Slightly? That little guy there could walk right under the horse without even ducking."
"TAYLOR: You're missing the big picture here, townsfolk. Now, this wonderful business belongs in Stars Hollow  whether Luke rents the space willingly or not."
"LUKE: How would I not rent it willingly?"
"TAYLOR: I'm talking about eminent domain, my friend. Check the town's bylaws. If a three-fourths majority finds it necessary to use the space for a specific function, the landowner must concede."
"LUKE: That's for taking over houses to turn into hospitals during a national emergency like the Civil w*r. If you wanna turn this place into a Civil w*r hospital, be my guest!"
"TAYLOR: Some would attest that the succor that my soda shop is going to offer is on the same level as the comfort that a hospital could provide."
"LUKE: You're gonna need a hospital, Taylor!"
"LORELAI: Hit him!"
"RORY: Which one?"
"LORELAI: Either one, I'm easy."
"TAYLOR: Come on, Luke. This shop is based on the original soda shop that was in town eighty years ago. Don't you see? You are preventing the town "
"LUKE: From moving backwards. Who here wants to do that?"
"LORELAI: [in high voice] We like ice cream."
"LUKE: Oh, come on."
"RORY: A nice burger from Luke's and an ice cream soda, yum!"
"LUKE: You want that thing?"
"LORELAI: With a cherry."
"LUKE: With the striped awning and the giant horse?"
"[Lorelai and Rory nod]"
"LUKE: [to Taylor] Be ready to pay through the nose."
"TAYLOR: We'll talk terms. We have our soda shop everybody! Meeting dismissed."
"KIRK: Taylor, is it too soon to talk about management opportunities?"
"LORELAI: [to Luke] Hey, you get to be Taylor's landlord, that's kind of cool."
"LUKE: Thanks for your lack of help."
"LORELAI: Grump."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[As people file out of the town meeting, Lane walks up to Lorelai and Rory]"
"LANE: So, how was lunch with Harvard guy?"
"RORY: Great, he answered all my questions."
"LORELAI: He makes a k*ll chicken, he sticks a lemon up its butt."
"LANE: Nice."
"RORY: And he gave me excellent tips on how to write my essay. We're very impressed with him."
"LORELAI: He passes the test."
"[a boy walks up to Lane]"
"DAVE: Excuse me, Lane?"
"LANE: That's me."
"DAVE: Okay, great, I'm Dave Rygalski."
"LANE: Right, hi. You're a guitarist."
"DAVE: Yeah."
"LANE: But how'd you know I was me?"
"DAVE: The Dead Kennedys shirt was a tip off."
"LANE: Good thinking. Hey, uh, isn't it a drag that Jello Biafra isn't singing for them anymore?"
"DAVE: Yeah, now their front-man's that kid from the Courtship of Eddie's Father."
"LANE: Yeah, what's next  Urkel joining the Wu-Tang Clan?"
"DAVE: Or maybe Malcolm in the Middle fronting for the Butthole Surfers."
"LANE: Some things are sacred."
"DAVE: I'm with ya on that."
"LANE: So, um, what's your band like?"
"DAVE: We do a lot of cool covers  uh, the Clash, the Kinks, et cetera. Statistically, it's like thirty-eight of the forty-three bands you listed."
"LANE: Nice percentage."
"DAVE: I can play you a song we demo'd a couple weeks ago using a drum machine."
"LANE: Great. [he takes some audio equipment out of his bag] What's all this?"
"DAVE: Well, this is a headphone amp and it just boosts the volume and makes the clarity off the hook, and then these are Grado 125s, which is just really, k*ll, k*ll portable sound. I'm sort of an audio geek, sorry."
"LANE: No, don't apologize, I love you. . .for that, for being that way. I love it. Um, I'm like that too."
"DAVE: You wanna go over to the bench maybe and have a listen?"
"LANE: Yeah."
"DAVE: Okay."
"[they walk away]"
"RORY: I think a love song's in their future."
"LORELAI: With lots of lyrics about snogging."
"RORY: About what?"
"[Dean walks up behind them]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hey. [they kiss] You missed everything."
"LORELAI: That's snogging."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: Bye. [walks away]"
"DEAN: So, any fireworks?"
"RORY: Well, there was a classic Luke/Taylor dispute, but it was resolved and will result in ice cream floats and twenty foot horses."
"DEAN: Good deal. And what about your lunch?"
"RORY: Oh, it was great. I feel so much better about things now. The application's not freaking me out anymore."
"DEAN: You look unfreaked."
"RORY: Well, nothing can stop me now. It's full steam ahead."
"DEAN: That's great. Can I ask you something?"
"RORY: Of course you can."
"DEAN: What happens when you leave?"
"RORY: When I leave when?"
"DEAN: When you leave for Harvard. . .do we break up?"
"RORY: Whoa, that was blunt and out of nowhere."
"DEAN: Well, it seems like we should be blunt right now."
"RORY: No, we don't break up. Do you want that?"
"DEAN: No, but how will we see each other?"
"RORY: Easy, weekends  that's what they were invented for."
"DEAN: So you'll come home, do homework all weekend, then leave."
"RORY: No, I can do my homework during the week or on the train coming home to see you, who I will spend my weekends with not doing homework. Plus, we can talk during the week on the phone constantly. Trust me, it'll feel like I never left."
"DEAN: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Christiane Amanpour spends half of her life standing in foxholes in third world countries, and she has a husband and a kid. And she was on C-SPAN last week getting some award, so if she and her husband can make it work, we can."
"DEAN: So we'll have access to the CNN jet?"
"RORY: No. Or hey, you can go to college in Boston."
"DEAN: I'm going to junior college."
"RORY: Boston has junior colleges."
"DEAN: But not dorm rooms."
"RORY: Well, you can rent an apartment."
"DEAN: With the money I get when I win the lottery? I mean, I think access to the CNN jet is more likely."
"RORY: Why are you being like this? So. . ."
"DEAN: Realistic?"
"RORY: Come on, be serious."
"DEAN: I am. I am."
"RORY: That's too serious."
"DEAN: Yeah, uh, you know, just forget it. Come on, we were gonna go to Luke's, right?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"DEAN: Let's go to Luke's."
"[they walk past Lane and Dave on the bench]"
"LANE: It's great, it really is."
"DAVE: Okay, cool. Well, listen, then I'll talk to the guys, uh, and we'll get together and play next week."
"LANE: Sure. Um, I've gotta get home."
"DAVE: All right. Well, uh, it was good meeting you, Lane."
"LANE: Same here."
"[Lane takes off her Dead Kennedys shirt; underneath is a shirt that says Trust God]"
"DAVE: Trust God  is that a band?"
"LANE: No. My life."
"[pan to Lorelai, Sookie, and Jackson]"
"SOOKIE: Oh, come on, you do not like modern art."
"JACKSON: Oh, then I was mistaken, I guess I don't. I'm a mindless android, I have no opinions."
"SOOKIE: Well, what kind do you like?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, do you like the kind that looks like someone hemorrhaged on a canvas?"
"JACKSON: Yes, I love hemorrhaging."
"SOOKIE: Or the sculpture that looks like it was dropped and then glued back together?"
"JACKSON: Actually, the real love of my life is being mercilessly teased by the two of you for simply stating an opinion."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're sorry."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, we're sorry. Kisses!"
"JACKSON: Oh, in public, no less."
"LORELAI: Hey, where's Rory? We need all the girls a-kissing ya."
"JACKSON: Hey, that reminds me, what are you gonna do with Rory's room?"
"LORELAI: Her room, when?"
"JACKSON: When she's gone. Are you doing anything with it?"
"LORELAI: Well, I haven't thought about it."
"JACKSON: Well, let me know. We can work something out."
"LORELAI: You want her room?"
"SOOKIE: For what, your burgeoning modern art collection?"
"JACKSON: I'm talking about my tools."
"SOOKIE: Oh, your tools, yeah."
"LORELAI: What tools?"
"JACKSON: I have this collection of antique farming tools that my dad passed down to me."
"SOOKIE: Pre-Revolutionary w*r. They're kind of valuable."
"JACKSON: And I've got no place to put them. I've been looking for the right space."
"LORELAI: In Rory's room?"
"SOOKIE: It's perfect!"
"LORELAI: But she's got all her stuff in it."
"JACKSON: Not for long."
"LORELAI: Yeah, right, not for long."
"JACKSON: Just think about it."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I will. I will."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[The phone is ringing]"
"LORELAI: No, no, not another band phone call!"
"RORY: We never gave Lane a cutoff time."
"LORELAI: Let the machine get it. I cannot talk to another seventeen-year-old whose every other word is uh'."
"RORY: Not even a word."
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"[They stand next to the phone and listen to the machine]"
"DARREN: [on answering machine] Hello, Gilmores! This is Darren Springsteen, how are ya? I just wanted to let you know that I just finished going over Rory's records here, and no shock, they're perfect. Rory, you are tailor-made for Harvard. They're lucky to have you. As far as I'm concerned, you should pack your bags. I'm gonna tell all this to the people in admissions and I'll give your headmaster a call as well, so take care and we'll talk again. Bye-bye. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: That's fantastic, honey."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You're in."
"RORY: Well, not officially."
"LORELAI: He said pack your bags."
"RORY: Yeah, cool."
"LORELAI: So what are you up to today? You have, uh, newspaper stuff to do, right?"
"RORY: Yeah, a ton, and you were going to catch up with some stuff at the inn?"
"LORELAI: Payroll. . . a lot of check signing to do."
"RORY: Are people waiting for their checks?"
"LORELAI: Kind of."
"RORY: Right. You know, um, the newspaper stuff can wait til Monday."
"LORELAI: Really? Cause I can sign the checks tomorrow."
"RORY: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"RORY: So what do you wanna do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, what do you wanna do?"
"RORY: I don't know, let's just hang."
"LORELAI: That sounds great."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the sidewalk past Luke's. Luke is arguing with Taylor about a sign he is hanging over the proposed soda shop that says ""Future Home of Taylor's Olde Fashioned Soda Shoppe""]"
"LUKE: You had to have ordered that sign weeks ago! You were that sure that I would cave in?"
"TAYLOR: Well, you did, didn't you? The right's too high."
"LUKE: And when did it become Taylor's? It said Stars Hollow on the stupid model, and I don't like the extra P and E at the end of shop. Get rid of it!"
"TAYLOR: No."
"LUKE: I'm your landlord, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: And as a tenant, I have rights. Talk to my lawyer if you disagree."
"LUKE: And how are you spelling rights, Taylor? With two E's and three S's?"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street toward the gazebo]"

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: So, I think I'm in touch with the other side."
"RORY: The other side of. . ."
"LORELAI: The other side."
"RORY: With republicans?"
"LORELAI: No. Lately I've been having these dark premonitions."
"RORY: Oh, about what?"
"[Luke brings their plates]"
"LUKE: Dead cow, dead cow. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: That's weird."
"RORY: He's always weird."
"LORELAI: No, I mean, my premonitions have been about death, about my death."
"RORY: I don't wanna hear this."
"LORELAI: And the thing is, they're all silly."
"RORY: What do you mean, silly?"
"LORELAI: In one, I slip on a banana peel and fall into a giant vat of whipped cream."
"RORY: Silly and fattening."
"LORELAI: In another, a turtle eats me."
"RORY: A turtle, how?"
"LORELAI: Very slowly. There's lots of chewing."
"RORY: And in your premonition, you didn't run away from what is perhaps the slowest land animal on the earth?"
"LORELAI: His first bite injects me with immobilizing poison."
"RORY: Well, you left that part out."
"LORELAI: Now, this last one's a little more gory. I'm out hunting "
"RORY: A favorite Lorelai Gilmore pastime."
"LORELAI: And my g*n backfires and my whole face spins around a bunch of times and winds up in the back of my head like Daffy Duck."
"RORY: That's the silliest one yet."
"LORELAI: Now, if that's how I go, you gotta promise to move my face back to the front of my head like Daffy did with his beak."
"RORY: I should be writing this down."
"LORELAI: You can remember to move my face to the front of my head."
"RORY: It depends on what I have going on that week."
"[Lane walks into the diner]"
"LANE: Hello Stars Hollow, are you ready to rock?"
"LORELAI: Let me guess, band practice tonight?"
"LANE: Yes, we're going to learn our fourth song. That's practically a set."
"[Lane sits down with them and takes a bite of Rory's burger]"
"LORELAI: Hm, I'm impressed."
"LANE: And then once we have a set, we'll get a gig, and then once we get a gig, we'll get a record deal."
"LORELAI: Swallow."
"LANE: And then after we get a record deal, we'll get really famous and then we'll have to give all of these interviews about how horrible it is to be really famous and how we never wanted this in the first place, all we care about is the music, and fame is gonna tear us apart. It's gonna be great!"
"LORELAI: And rehearsing in the music shop's been working out?"
"LANE: Perfectly  it's totally time efficient, being a thirty-second commute from my house. We practice for two hours, I'm home in time to watch reruns of Johnny Yune's talk show on Korean television with my mom, who thinks I hooked up with you guys  which I did, so I'm not even lying."
"LORELAI: Well, you're kinda lying."
"LANE: I'm fibbing, but a fib is not a lie."
"LORELAI: Hm, I'd say it's a fib-slash-lie."
"LANE: No, no, it's not a lie, and I can always tell cause of the few times that I've out and out lied to my mother, I'd get this feeling in my gut like a wild animal was burrowing into it, and I'm not getting that."
"LORELAI: Wild animals burrowing into my stomach  another one of my premonitions."
"RORY: Pretty spooky."
"LANE: I've gotta go. I'm single-handedly improving the reputation of drummers everywhere by being on time for every rehearsal. [takes Rory's burger] Thanks for the food. [leaves]"
"[Rory takes Lorelai's burger]"
"LORELAI: Uh, excuse me."
"RORY: Lane took mine."
"LORELAI: Okay, this band thing is really not working out for me. Let's go. See ya, Luke."
"LUKE: See ya."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk to the door as Shane walks in]"
"LORELAI: Turn sideways!"
"[Shane rushes past them over to Jess at the counter]"
"LORELAI: That girl's a freak."
"[Jess and Shane start kissing]"
"LUKE: Make a hole."
"[Jess and Shane stop kissing long enough for Luke to walk past them]"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO THE MUSIC SHOP"
"[Lane and her band are practicing]"
"ZACH: [sings] London calling to the faraway towns, now that the w*r's declared and battle come down. London calling to the underworld, come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls. . ."
"DAVE: Whoa whoa whoa, can you guys hold it? It doesn't sound right."
"LANE: It sounded good to me."
"DAVE: No, it's wrong. Something's missing."
"ZACH: Yeah, volume."
"LANE: We can't play any louder, guys."
"ZACH: We've got to."
"LANE: But that's the agreement  free practice space, but we have to play quietly."
"DAVE: Just try and live with it, Zach."
"ZACH: Dude, Brian's breathing is louder than the song."
"BRIAN: I've got a deviated septum. All the women in my family and me have it."
"ZACH: Well, it's throwing me off."
"LANE: Hold your breath when we're playing, Brian. There, problem solved. Okay, come on, now, let's rock. One, two, three "
"ZACH: Wait. The bottom line here is that breathing should not be louder than a rock band. Am I right or am I right?"
"BRIAN: You're right."
"ZACH: Rygalski?"
"DAVE: Well, it "
"ZACH: We need to crank it up."
"LANE: Just listen harder, that'll make it sound louder."
"DAVE: Can't we turn it up at all?"
"LANE: Well, maybe we could possibly turn the amps up from three to, say, three and a half, but that's it."
"ZACH: Forget it."
"DAVE: Zach, come on, we just got started."
"ZACH: Dude, Lawrence Welk cranked louder than this. It's a waste of time."
"LANE: Wait, Zach, no, you don't understand. We can't play louder. See, my mom has this special antenna that can pick up non-Christian music being played within a football field's distance of our house, and she'd immediately come looking for me in order to shield me from the perversion."
"BRIAN: If Zach's going, I'm going."
"LANE: Wait, no, Brian, I'm not exaggerating. Once, a guy in our town named Kirk was practicing Bohemian Rhapsody with his band, the Kirk Gleason Five, and my mom shut them down so fast that the band fled without their instruments and never came back for them. To this day, Kirk can't listen to Queen without tearing up."
"BRIAN: Sorry."
"ZACH: Having a free practice space was cool and all, but not like this."
"BRIAN: We should just rent a space in Hartford."
"LANE: Hartford, Connecticut?"
"ZACH: It's not that far."
"LANE: Yeah, or maybe, how bout France? We could practice in France, too, or Iceland!"
"DAVE: Lane."
"LANE: The moon's probably available, we could crank it way up on the moon!"
"DAVE: A word, please."
"[Dave leads Lane outside onto the sidewalk]"
"LANE: Dave, talk to them. You're the leader, that's flat out insubordination going on in there! They show be flogged, heel-hogged, strung up from the highest yardarm!"
"DAVE: No, I can't."
"LANE: Why?"
"DAVE: Because we're supposed to be a one-for-all band like the Clash or U2  it's a democracy."
"LANE: Democracies are overrated. Now get in there and kick some butt."
"DAVE: It's not how it works."
"LANE: I'll fix Brian's deviated septum  I'll ram one of my sticks up his nose!"
"DAVE: Lane, think about this, do you really believe this is working?"
"LANE: No, it's not working. We sound like a bunch of w*nk*r."
"DAVE: We need a real practice space. We need to be able to really play. Wouldn't you like to actually be able to hit both the cymbals?"
"LANE: Yeah."
"DAVE: Okay, then, we need to do this."
"LANE: I know, I just don't wanna leave the band."
"DAVE: What? You can't leave the band. That's not what anybody wants, especially me. Lane, listen to me, okay  you're perfect for us, it's working."
"LANE: So I have to figure out a way to rehearse in Hartford two or three nights a week."
"DAVE: Yeah, that's not so tough."
"LANE: No, it's not so tough. And maybe at the same time I'll attempt to master quantum physics, and throw Sanskrit in there, too."
"DAVE: Do your best. Not with the Sanskrit thing, that's pretty worthless  but with the band."
"LANE: I'll try."
"DAVE: There's no way you're gonna become our Pete Best. There's no way."
"LANE: You're sweet."
"DAVE: We should get back in there."
"LANE: Okay, um, I'll be in in a minute."
"CUT TO LANE'S BEDROOM"
"[Lane is in her closet talking on the phone]"
"LANE: Wrack your brain. I mean, we've really gotta think here."
"RORY: It's quite a pickle."
"LANE: No, Rory, pickles are smaller. This is much bigger than a pickle."
"[At Lorelai's house, Rory is in her bedroom on the phone]"
"RORY: Okay, let's stop saying the word pickle."
"LANE: Fine."
"RORY: Now, how many nights a week would you have to go to Hartford to practice?"
"LANE: Two, plus a weekend afternoon."
"RORY: Okay, so that's three big blocks of time that you'd have to account for."
"LANE: Very big blocks of time."
"RORY: Plus, you have no car to transport your drums anywhere as of yet."
"LANE: Or a driver's license."
"RORY: Or any drums because you're borrowing them from the shop."
"LANE: Temporarily until I can buy my own set  with money that I don't know where I'm gonna get."
"RORY: Yup, you're right  that's more than a pickle."
"LANE: You're making light  now stop and focus. And turn down the Cornershop, it's distracting."
"RORY: No, your Coltrane is distracting, turn that down."
"LANE: Hey, I'm in angst here and Coltrane speaks to my soul. I can't turn it down."
"RORY: Fine, in deference to your soul, I'll turn mine down. Hey, here's a crazy thought. How about you tell your mom the truth and insist that she lets you play with the band and rehearse in Stars Hollow loudly as long as your schoolwork doesn't suffer?"
"LANE: Oh, I'm sorry, was that a serious suggestion?"
"RORY: Hey, it's worth a sh*t."
"LANE: No, you're thinking your mom, here, Rory. If I said that to mine, she'd start waving a crucifix at me."
"RORY: If she says no, she says no, but right now you're out of options. We have another call, just think about it?"
"LANE: Okay, I will. And hey, you know I like Cornershop."
"RORY: I know. Bye."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Rory answers the call waiting]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"DEBBIE: Hi, Rory?"
"RORY: Yes."
"DEBBIE: This is Debbie Fincher  Kathy's mom from Stars Hollow High."
"RORY: Oh, hi Mrs. Fincher."
"DEBBIE: Well, hi right back to you. You know, we miss you since you started that fancy school of yours. Is it fun?"
"RORY: It's hard but I like it."
"DEBBIE: Oh well, super. Uh, listen, is your mom home?"
"RORY: Oh, sure, just a second. Say hi to Kathy for me."
"DEBBIE: I will."
"RORY: Hold on."
"[Rory walks into the kitchen; Lorelai is sitting at the table]"
"RORY: Phone. It's Debbie Fincher."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: From Stars Hollow High. Kathy Fincher's mom."
"LORELAI: Oh, I remember Kathy."
"RORY: You met Debbie many times, had many conversations with her at bake sales, school plays, the PTA."
"LORELAI: Not ringing a bell."
"RORY: I used to go swimming at her house all the time. You and Debbie had long chats when you dropped me off."
"LORELAI: No. . .no."
"RORY: Blonde hair, medium height, drove a Range Rover."
"LORELAI: Does she also breathe and have toes?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, narrow it down to less than eight thousand possibilities."
"RORY: I did with the swimming."
"LORELAI: I remember the water."
"RORY: Come on, blonde hair, medium height."
"LORELAI: See, even you can't think of another way to describe her."
"RORY: You have no memory of this woman?"
"LORELAI: All those Stars Hollow moms looked alike, except for Lane's mom and that one mom with the freaky glass eye that never moved."
"RORY: Take the phone."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hi Debbie, how are you?"
"DEBBIE: Great, Lorelai, and yourself?"
"LORELAI: Just fine, thanks."
"DEBBIE: The gang and I have missed you so much at school events. You were always such a kick."
"LORELAI: Aw, well, I really miss you and the gang."
"DEBBIE: Hey, listen, I have a proposition for you. The PTA likes to ask prominent locals in business if they could talk to the students about how they got to where they are  you know, all the hard work it takes, success stories, you know. And we thought about you."
"LORELAI: To suggest people I know who have success stories, or. . ."
"DEBBIE: No, silly, we'd like for you to address the class."
"LORELAI: Me, really?"
"DEBBIE: Well, yes. You're a young woman and you run that beautiful inn, it's a huge responsibility, and you do it with such style."
"LORELAI: Wow, well, that's really sweet. It's always nice to be well thought of."
"Oh, Debbie, before we go any further, I'm dying to know  how's Kathy? What's she up to?"
"DEBBIE: She is just terrific. She's applied to a couple schools in California, so she's really excited, although. . ."
"[Lorelai covers the mouthpiece of the phone and talks to Rory]"
"LORELAI: So she wants me to speak to some kids about my business success."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: That's great. What are you doing with the phone?"
"LORELAI: Oh, she's blabbing about her kid. We probably got another thirty seconds or so."
"RORY: You're awful."
"LORELAI: No, I'm a kick. Should I do it?"
"RORY: Yeah, toot your own horn, you little missy."
"LORELAI: I'm a success, who'd have thought?"
"RORY: I suspected you had it in you."
"LORELAI: From rags to riches. . .I wonder why Larry King hasn't called."
"RORY: Mom, Debbie, please."
"[Lorelai brings the phone back up to her ear]"
"DEBBIE: . . .so the internship will keep her local, which is a nice bonus for Bill and me, you know?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure, yeah. Well, be sure to say hi to her and to Bill, and by the way, yes, I'd be happy to talk to the class."
"DEBBIE: Terrific! Oh, the gang will be so thrilled. Now, there'll probably be a second speaker with you, do you mind?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's fine, who's it gonna be?"
"DEBBIE: Uh, well, we've had some suggestions, but do you know anyone?"
"LORELAI: Well, you know, my friend the Sultan of Brunei is so hard to pin down."
"DEBBIE: Ha-ha, there's that sense of humor. Well, we were considering Luke Danes, but he usually turns these things down."
"LORELAI: I could talk to him if you'd like."
"DEBBIE: That would be just terrific. The two of you together would be a kick."
"LORELAI: Well, then, I'll just kick him til he agrees to do it, how does that sound?"
"DEBBIE: Okay, Thursday at four p.m., is that okay?"
"LORELAI: I'll be there, Deb."
"DEBBIE: Oh, you rat! You rat!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"DEBBIE: You remembered how much I hate being called Deb."
"LORELAI: I'm wicked."
"DEBBIE: Well, thank you Lorelai, and I'll talk to you soon."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye. [hangs up] Huh. She hates being called Deb."
"RORY: I'll make a mental note. [pinches Lorelai's cheeks]"
"LORELAI: Ow, ow, ow!"
"RORY: I'm so proud of my little success!"
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lane walks down the steps. She starts to walk toward her mother in the kitchen, then walks back to the steps and starts talking to herself]"
"LANE: Stop it, don't run, just walk in there and tell her what you want. After all, she's your mother and she wants you to be happy . . .on some level, I think. Maybe not. What are you doing? Do not back off. Just move. Come on, move. Move your foot, move your foot, one foot. Lane, move your foot, right."
"[her mother comes up behind her]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: Yeah?"
"MRS. KIM: Come with me."
"LANE: Okay."
"[They walk to the kitchen.]"
"MRS. KIM: Sit, sit. You want tea?"
"LANE: Mama, I wanna "
"MRS. KIM: Sit."
"LANE: Sorry. I wanted to talk to you about something, um, an idea I had. . have, for me to do something that would be very beneficial to me, and you by extension because well, if one person is happy, then the other person is happy, and so I had an idea that, of how I could be and then you could be and then we would be and. . .tea would be good."
"MRS. KIM: Here, I want you to fill these out. [hands her a stack of papers]"
"LANE: What are these?"
"MRS. KIM: College applications."
"LANE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: Don't worry. Every one in this pile approved by me and Reverend Melmin."
"LANE: I haven't heard of one of these schools."
"MRS. KIM: They're all good religious programs, and I've already thrown out the ones that let boys and girls sit in the cafeteria together, the party schools."
"LANE: Oh, great."
"MRS. KIM: I will help you fill them out and we'll mail them on the way to choir practice, okay?"
"LANE: Yes, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: Good. Now, if you meet Jesus walking on the street, what are the three questions you would like to ask? Ah."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is at the front desk organizing some index cards]"
"MICHEL: Hm, your speech for that class?"
"LORELAI: Just some talking points."
"MICHEL: And this speech is about your success in business, yes?"
"LORELAI: Pretty much."
"MICHEL: You must be very fortunate to live in this tiny town where people make very little money. It elevates you by comparison."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"MICHEL: I wonder who their last speaker was -- the fellow in short pants that walks up and down the square with a metal detector?"
"LORELAI: Hm, I wouldn't know."
"MICHEL: And if they find someone who drives a car that is less than eight years old, what will they do  crown him king of successful people?"
"LORELAI: Unless it's a woman, and then they'll crown her queen."
"MICHEL: Mm, and if they are "
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Go away. [answers phone] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"LUKE: I'm backing out."
"LORELAI: Too late, sorry."
"LUKE: I'm not speaking to that stupid class."
"LORELAI: But you agreed."
"LUKE: I'm out, case closed, no debating."
"LORELAI: Great, fine, do what you want. I guess I'm just out the thousand-dollar deposit."
"LUKE: What deposit?"
"LORELAI: For the room."
"LUKE: What room?"
"LORELAI: For the thing, for the afterwards thing. . ."
"LUKE: Oh, wait, now, you're talking crazy talk trying to confuse me, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: Aren't you?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Who?"
"LUKE: Stop."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"LUKE: Uh, hold on a sec! I agreed to this under coercion."
"LORELAI: You said yes on your own."
"LUKE: I said yes because when I said no you talked baby talk loudly in front of all my customers until I got so sick of it I just agreed to do it to shut you up."
"LORELAI: I'm incorrigible!"
"LUKE: It's not a binding agreement, it's coercion."
"LORELAI: Well, you gave in just in time because, uh, I was about to transition out of baby talk and into my Louis Armstrong voice, and that, my friend, is a whole lot worse than baby talk."
"LUKE: I hate that building."
"LORELAI: What, the school?"
"LUKE: Three years of going there, I have no good memories."
"LORELAI: You must have some."
"LUKE: None. Kids were as dumb then as they are now."
"LORELAI: I think you'll enjoy this."
"LUKE: Think about going back to your high school to give a talk. How would that feel?"
"LORELAI: Okay, not all your points are bad, but it's not my school, it's your school, and if you cancel, this whole town will know and when you walk down the street people will point and whisper, There goes that Luke, he's a real talk-canceler guy.'"
"LUKE: Ouch."
"LORELAI: Plus, I promised the PTA, so my fragile reputation is on the line."
"LUKE: I think you'll live."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: No!"
"LORELAI: [in Louis Armstrong voice] Hello, Dolly!"
"LUKE: Stop that."
"LORELAI: [in Louis Armstrong voice] This is Louis, Dolly!"
"LUKE: I'll just hang up."
"LORELAI: [in Louis Armstrong voice] I'll be coming round the diner singing soooooooongs."
"LUKE: Have you been diagnosed?"
"LORELAI: See you tomorrow at four."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"LANE: Oh, it was a fine collection, believe me."
"RORY: She made you apply to every one?"
"LANE: And measured my head for a wimple."
"RORY: Out of twenty-three schools, there wasn't one that you might want to go to?"
"LANE: It depends on what I'm looking for. Of course, all the great Seventh Day Adventist schools were represented, with their ban on dancing, gum chewing and bowling. Quaker College was a delightful surprise, with its special appeal to Richard Nixon, who's dead but still deeply involved in campus recruiting. Oh, and the piece de resistance! She found an Amish school in Nicaragua. Nicaragua! A big shout out to Mama Kim on that one!"
"RORY: Look, Mama Kim always starts out super serious on everything but then lightens with time."
"LANE: But I don't have time. Schools that I like will fill up and my band, my beloved band, will find another drummer, and if it's a girl I'm gonna be twice as mad."
"RORY: Look, Lane, just try to calm down."
"LANE: No, calm is for losers. I've spent my whole life compromising and being the good little girl and not doing what I want. Or doing what I want and hiding it and feeling guilty for doing it, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. I mean, I even lost my first boyfriend because of all this."
"RORY: What boyfriend?"
"LANE: Henry."
"RORY: Oh, right, Henry."
"LANE: See, that's how pathetic my life is. I'm calling a boyfriend a guy that I never even went out on a date with, and that my own best friend doesn't even remember, which is not your fault because there's nothing to remember."
"RORY: Okay, so besides power walking, what are you gonna do about it?"
"LANE: Take a stand!"
"RORY: What kind of stand? [Lane walks into the beauty supply store] Lane!"
"[Rory follows her inside]"
"CUT TO INSIDE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE"
"RORY: Lane."
"LANE: Follow my anger."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LANE: Choosing a color."
"RORY: You're gonna dye your hair?"
"LANE: Yes, I am. Lots of choices here. Help me narrow it down."
"RORY: You can't do this."
"LANE: Of course I can."
"RORY: And what, walk around in a hood all the time? How are you gonna hide this from your mom?"
"LANE: I'm not gonna hide it, that's the point."
"RORY: Lane, think about this for a second, at least."
"LANE: Rory, I've been thinking about this my whole life. Nothing's gonna change unless I change it, and now's the time. I need to make a clear statement, one I can't go back on or chicken out on, one that everyone can see. And this is my instrument, it says This is me, this is Lane Kim.' [holds up a container of dye]"
"RORY: That is you, it's black hair dye."
"LANE: This is merely a prop until we find my true color. Now, what do you think? Pink? Or is that too Pink the singer and Kelly Osbourne and Gwen Stefani. . .man, there's a lot of cheese associated with the color pink. Okay, pink's out. There. . .there's blue  what about blue?"
"RORY: Blue's probably not right for your skin tone, and I agree with you about pink. What about purple?"
"LANE: Yes, purple, you're brilliant."
"RORY: And bleach, don't forget the bleach."
"LANE: Bleach, right, okay, I'll get the bleach. Thank you."
"[Rory walks to the checkout counter]"
"RORY: And make sure that you get some. . . gloves."
"[Rory is surprised when she sees that Shane is the cashier. Lane walks to the counter with a pile of supplies]"
"LANE: Got them."
"RORY: Good, good."
"LANE: You all right?"
"RORY: Yeah, fine, let's go."
"LANE: It's a good day today, isn't it?"
"SHANE: Mmhmm. Twelve fifty-two."
"LANE: And I've got exact change for you."
"SHANE: Super. [sees Rory staring at her] You need something?"
"RORY: No. No, I just, um. . . I was wondering if there's a money-back guarantee. You know, in case her hair falls out or something."
"SHANE: Um, sure. If your hair falls out, we'll give you your money back."
"RORY: Good. You heard that. The second you go bald, you can come get your money back."
"LANE: Rory, you're putting a damper on my Independence Day."
"RORY: Sorry, let's go."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[The next day, Lorelai walks into Luke's]"
"LORELAI: Lucas, la escuela!"
"LUKE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey. Did you lose track of time?"
"LUKE: What? Why?"
"LORELAI: It's four o'clock."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: We were supposed to be at the school, like, now."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: But you're not ready."
"LUKE: What? Oh, right, right, sorry. [removes apron] Okay, I'm ready."
"LORELAI: Au contraire."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: You are so not ready."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: The grunge look is out."
"LUKE: Hey, I'm not dressing up for this."
"LORELAI: Well, you need something better than that."
"LUKE: The whole point of this stupid class talk was for us to talk about our work and our success. This flannel shirt is my most successful outfit. I've closed many a deal in this outfit. It's my power outfit."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"[Lorelai grabs his shirt collar and pulls him upstairs]"
"LUKE: Hey, hey, hey, hey, let go, let go, hey, you're pinching me!"
"LORELAI: Go!"
"[cut to upstairs hallway]"
"LUKE: I don't wanna change."
"LORELAI: Be a good boy and I'll buy you a toy afterward. You wanna toy?"
"[cut to inside Luke's apartment; Lorelai and Luke walk in, Jess is inside]"
"LORELAI: Sorry to barge in."
"JESS: No problem. What was that about a toy?"
"LORELAI: Your Uncle Luke is getting one if he's a good boy."
"LUKE: Can we make this more demeaning? Hey, why don't you go downstairs and help out Caesar?"
"JESS: I think my education comes first, don't you?"
"[Lorelai pulls a shirt out of Luke's closet]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Jimmy Buffett?"
"LUKE: Put that back."
"LORELAI: You like Jimmy Buffett? He's so mellow."
"LUKE: I've just been to a few shows, that's all."
"LORELAI: A few shows? Oh my God, you're a Buffetthead."
"LUKE: Is that the one you want me to wear or not?"
"LORELAI: Sing Margaritaville."
"LUKE: No."
"JESS: That attitude's gonna lose you that toy."
"LUKE: Stay outta this!"
"[Lorelai pulls another shirt from the closet]"
"LORELAI: We've got ourselves a winner."
"LUKE: Fine, fine, come on. [takes the shirt and walks toward the bathroom]"
"LORELAI: Just change in here."
"LUKE: I'll be more comfortable in here. [goes into bathroom]"
"LORELAI: I've seen you swimming at the lake so I've seen you with your shirt off."
"JESS: Lately? Cause he's really let himself go."
"LUKE: [from bathroom] I'll be one second."
"LORELAI: Lose the baseball cap, too."
"JESS: You run the risk of his head falling off without it."
"LORELAI: I think he'll be okay."
"[Lorelai looks at Jess' closet curiously]"
"JESS: Something wrong?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no. . .no, I just. . .no."
"[Luke walks out of the bathroom]"
"LUKE: Happy?"
"LORELAI: Thrilled. Now a tie with that would be just great."
"LUKE: We're leaving. And it's gotta be something I don't have to put together."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: My toy."
"LORELAI: Got it."
"JESS: Talk good."
"[Luke and Lorelai walk out of the apartment]"
"[cut to hallway]"
"LORELAI: Wow, we're late. Oh, by the way, Jess had a girl in the closet."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Come on, pip pip!"
"LUKE: Who? What was that? Lorelai? What about the closet?CUT TO LANE'S HOUSE"
"[Lane and Rory are in the bathroom preparing to bleach Lane's hair]"
"LANE: Okay, combs, rags, instructions, timer, towels, tunes."
"RORY: All systems a go."
"LANE: So far, so good."
"RORY: Now, are you sure about this?"
"LANE: Will you stop?"
"RORY: I'm just making sure."
"LANE: I'll sign a waiver if you want. Hit play please."
"RORY: We should open a window, shouldn't we?"
"LANE: It's freezing outside."
"RORY: Yeah, but the bleach is gonna stink up the whole house."
"LANE: Let it. Let it be the first clue that something's happened for when my mom gets home. Let the thick smell of bleach meet her at the doorway like a force that'll usher her into the next chapter of Lane Kim's life. The smell of bleach is the smell of freedom!"
"RORY: You're very dramatic today."
"LANE: To hell with the floor! Oh, that felt good to say."
"RORY: You done?"
"LANE: I'm done."
"RORY: Take your seat, please. [Lane sits] And here we go. [Rory starts applying the bleach] How you doing?"
"LANE: Fine."
"RORY: Feeling good?"
"LANE: Feeling great. This is such a catharsis. I have never felt so naturally high in my life. Stings a little, though."
"RORY: Yeah, that happens."
"LANE: But just a little, no biggie. More than a little actually, it's kind of a big little."
"RORY: Just keep me posted."
"LANE: In that case, it's kind of a lot. Yup, yup, a lot of sting happening here."
"RORY: Try thinking about something else. God, this smells awful."
"LANE: Okay, thinking about something else, something else. Thinking about puppy dogs. Thinking about getting things in the mail. I love getting things in the mail, letters and packages."
"RORY: Got a package."
"LANE: What's that?"
"RORY: Oh, Jim Carrey says that in Ace Ventura."
"LANE: Good distraction. Still thinking. . .thinking about world events, lots going on there. Thinking about the last movie I saw. Vin Diesel was in it. Thinking about Vin Diesel now. Thinking about where Vin Diesel got the name Vin Diesel. Thinking about Vin Diesel's mysterious ethnicity. Thinking about how surprising it is to have so much to think about with Vin Diesel. Who knew, who knew? Okay, now I'm just thinking about the pain, we're into pain here."
"RORY: Back to Vin Diesel."
"LANE: I've exhausted Vin Diesel, but the pain  that's not exhausted!"
"RORY: What kind of pain is it?"
"LANE: Ever light your head on fire? I haven't, but I don't have to now cause I know how it feels."
"RORY: I'll rinse it out."
"LANE: No, we'd have to start all over again and now that I know how much pain there is, I'll chicken out for sure!"
"RORY: I'm getting dizzy from the smell."
"LANE: Let's focus on my pain. Now read the bottle, tell me what to do in case of pain."
"RORY: Um, blah blah blah, do not apply to a broken scalp  is your scalp broken?"
"LANE: I don't know, maybe. I don't know my scalp that well."
"RORY: There's nothing else about pain. Oh, a girl told me once that if your scalp is hurting from bleach, drink a 7UP. It's something to do with the bubbles."
"LANE: The Kim household does not have soft drinks."
"RORY: Well, what do you got?"
"LANE: Something called Salad Water imported from Korea. Believe me, it's nothing like 7UP."
"RORY: Oh my God, we have to open this window."
"LANE: Okay, I have got to do something!"
"RORY: Run around the block!"
"LANE: Why?"
"RORY: I don't know!"
"LANE: Good enough for me!"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Lorelai, Luke, and Debbie are walking down the hallway]"
"DEBBIE: It's so good of you both to do this, really."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're happy to be here, right?"
"LUKE: Yup, zippity doo dah."
"DEBBIE: Oh, Luke, it must be fun to be back at your old alma mater, huh?"
"LUKE: Oh yeah, I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy here."
"LORELAI: Don't let him fool you. He told me he was so excited about today, he couldn't sleep last night."
"DEBBIE: Oh, we're all excited, too. It's been so long since we saw you, Lorelai. We had some laughs with this one, let me tell you."
"LUKE: Oh yeah, she's a funny one."
"DEBBIE: The book fair of 97. . .what you said to that one rude customer  uh! Priceless how you put him in his place."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I put that man in his place, all right, zing!"
"DEBBIE: Oh oh oh, what you said to him! How could anyone forget?"
"LORELAI: Huh, yeah."
"DEBBIE: Hey, Old Man. . ."
"LORELAI: . . .old man. . ."
"DEBBIE: Stick a crowbar -"
"LORELAI: . . .crowbar. . ."
"DEBBIE: - in your wallet -"
"LORELAI: . . . in his wallet. . ."
"DEBBIE: - and cough up some dough -"
"LORELAI: . . .dough. . ."
"DEBBIE: - cause this is for our kids!"
"LORELAI: . . .our kids! Ha ha!"
"DEBBIE: You do remember!"
"LORELAI: What, it's emblazoned up here Debbie, all those good times."
"DEBBIE: Definitely. Now everyone's gathered. The vice-principal will finish up in a second and then we'll call you in. Lorelai, you wanna go first?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, sure. Is that okay?"
"LUKE: It's okay by me."
"DEBBIE: Great. See you in a minute. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: I couldn't pick that woman out of a lineup if my life depended on it."
"[While Luke walks over to a chair and sits down, Lorelai looks out the door of the school and sees Lane running through the street with bleach on her head. Lorelai walks over to Luke.]"
"LORELAI: Will you lighten up?"
"LUKE: No, I won't lighten up."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"LUKE: I hate this place. Still smells the same  old, repressive."
"[Lorelai sits down next to him and pulls her notecards out of her pocket]"
"LORELAI: Being back here doesn't make you nostalgic at all?"
"LUKE: I liked the final bell, that's about it. What are those?"
"LORELAI: They're, uh, my notes for the talk."
"LUKE: You put thought into this?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, don't you have notes?"
"LUKE: I run a diner, what are my notes? I open the door, people come in, they order food, I cook the food, I serve the food, they eat the food. Then there's a terrific action sequence where I refill coffee and water. And oh, my big finale is a description of the whole end of the evening mopping up ceremony."
"LORELAI: Hey, you're sure you don't mind me going first?"
"LUKE: Are you kidding? There's a good chance you'll yack so much they won't even get to me."
"[Lorelai looks inside a display case]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing, nothing at all, Butch."
"[Luke walks over to her. His high school picture is hanging in the display case with the caption ""State High Hurdles Champion  1985 - Butch Danes""]"
"LUKE: For the love of. . .what's that doing there?"
"LORELAI: What's it doing? It's yelling, Mock me, mock me!'"
"LUKE: It shouldn't be there."
"LORELAI: Oh no, you're right. It should have its own special display at the diner with a big old spotlight on it."
"LUKE: Don't they need my permission for this? This should be illegal."
"LORELAI: No, those shorts with that t*nk top should be illegal."
"LUKE: Okay, stop now."
"LORELAI: What was your girlfriend's name, Sissy?"
"LUKE: As a matter of fact, no."
"LORELAI: Oh, the girls just swooned when Butch Danes took the field."
"LUKE: I knew there was another good reason not to do this."
"LORELAI: Oh no, don't walk away, Butch. Well, if I thought you didn't care, I'd die, oh, I'd just die."
"CUT TO LANE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory and Lane are in the bathroom. Lane's hair is blond.]"
"LANE: It's weird."
"RORY: Like straw."
"LANE: I feel like I should be singing If I Only Had a Brain.'"
"RORY: Now, you feel better? Burning's completely gone?"
"LANE: Completely. I even think the Salad Water's helping."
"RORY: Okay, here goes nothing. [starts applying the purple dye] So have you mentioned dyeing your hair to the band yet?"
"LANE: No, but they'll be cool with it. They've all got tattoos. Dave and Zach have musical themes and Brian's got Snoopy."
"RORY: Poor guy."
"LANE: Yeah, but he's a slamming bass player."
"RORY: So you haven't even mentioned it to Dave?"
"LANE: I just said I didn't tell the band."
"RORY: Not even Dave?"
"LANE: No, not even to Dave. And what's with all the pressing?"
"RORY: I don't know, Dave's just different from the other two."
"LANE: Of course, he's the defacto leader."
"RORY: I know, but it also seemed like from the day you guys met there was a little something happening there."
"LANE: I don't know what you're talking about."
"RORY: You're always talking about him. You always seem to be thinking about him. And now with this hair emancipation of yours, you're going to unheard of lengths to make a statement to your mother about who you are so you can have a sh*t at staying in the band  all roads lead to Dave."
"LANE: Rory, Dave and I are professionals."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: Plus, the rock and roll highway is littered with casualties of band members who have dated and broken the band apart."
"RORY: That's a sensible attitude."
"LANE: Very sensible, very sensible. Dave and I are very sensible people. I'm in love with him."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: Is it that obvious?"
"RORY: Only to a guy with sunglasses and a dog selling pencils."
"LANE: He's so cute."
"RORY: Definitely cute."
"LANE: And smart  you know, that's such a rare package. It's usually one or the other."
"RORY: It's wrong, but that's the way it usually is."
"LANE: It just increases the amount of competition for the Daves of the world."
"RORY: You're rare, too, don't forget."
"LANE: I've never really felt this way before. I mean, Henry  yes, but we never spent any real time together. It's not just puppy love, you know, it's different. I mean, I get butterflies in my stomach when I think about him, and when I call him to work out times for band practice, the ring of his telephone gets me really excited. And last week, someone said Dave at school  it wasn't even about my Dave, and I almost lost it, I got so shaky."
"RORY: My Dave  that's so cute."
"LANE: Stop it."
"RORY: This sounds like love to me."
"LANE: It does, doesn't it? My first love, wow."
"RORY: Yeah, wow."
"LANE: I finally have a first love, like what you and Dean have."
"RORY: Right. . . exactly."
"LANE: Of course, I don't exactly have what you and Dean have because you love Dean and Dean loves you back. In my situation, I love Dave and Dave thinks that I have a decent sense of rhythm."
"RORY: Don't move, you'll drip."
"LANE: God, you're so lucky  to love a guy who actually knows you love him and who loves you back. That's gotta be the best feeling ever."
"RORY: I think this purple's gonna look good."
"LANE: I want that. I want that really bad."
"RORY: You'll have that. You will have your perfect first love and second love and any other love you want because you're great and purple heads will not be denied."
"LANE: Now that should've been put on the box."
"RORY: Okay, now, head down please."

"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Lorelai and Luke are waiting in the hallway. Debbie comes out of the classroom]"
"DEBBIE: Okay, we're all ready for you guys."
"LORELAI: Great, excellent."
"[they walk into the classroom]"
"DEBBIE: Okay, uh, Luke, you can have a seat here while Lorelai's talking, okay?"
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: [points to desk] Hey, what's that? Luke plus Sissy."
"LUKE: Start your speech."
"DEBBIE: Okay, everyone, we're ready to begin. We have two local luminaries here to talk to us today. You probably all recognize Luke Danes from his fabulous diner, but we're really excited to begin with a former Stars Hollow High mom, Lorelai Gilmore."
"[applause]"
"LORELAI: No, no, save it for when I wow you with my brilliance. I'm really happy to be here with you all today. I recognize a lot of you from over the years and you're all getting taller and older  stop it. Anyhow, as some of you know, I run the Independence Inn. Sounds simple, running an inn. Well, the sentence is simple, the job is not. Like most jobs, mine involves many other people, people it is my job to hire, to train, and to inspire because when you have good employees it makes you look good. Oh, questions already  are questions okay?"
"DEBBIE: They're encouraged."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"GIRL 1: You're Rory Gilmore's mom, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: Yes I am, and proud of it."
"GIRL 1: Oh."
"LORELAI: Oh, is that it? Well, I hope all your questions are that easy. Okay, now, why is it necessary to inspire employees? Why can't you just train them and let them do their jobs? Well. . .yes?"
"GIRL 2: Didn't you get pregnant when you were sixteen?"
"LORELAI: Um, sixteen. . .it was around that age. Sixteen, that sounds right. Okay. Different people working for you will have different needs. . .yeah?"
"BOY: Well, what about school?"
"LORELAI: School? I'm sorry."
"BOY: Did you drop out when you got pregnant with Rory?"
"LORELAI: No, technically, I didn't drop out. I, uh, I kept going as long as I could while I got pregnant, which I would recommend to any girl. Not the getting pregnant part, obviously. Um, although, uh, if that happens, um, you know. . . it shouldn't. I mean, it could but you should try to avoid it. . . um, anyway, uh, I got my GED, yeah."
"DEBBIE: Lorelai, why don't we move this along?"
"LORELAI: Yes, oh, moving it along, moving it along. Okay, okay, okay. Boy, I should've been more organized here."
"GIRL 1: Well, are you sorry you got pregnant?"
"LORELAI: No, it brought me Rory, but timing is everything. I mean, I could've. . .sixteen, you guys are sixteen, right . . .and hey, is that clock right?"
"GIRL 3: What do you mean by timing?"
"GIRL 1: Yeah, if you had waited and had a baby with another man at a different time. . ."
"GIRL 4: It wouldn't have been Rory, right?"
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what's fun to talk about? Late checkout."
"GIRL 2: But it was good you got pregnant when you did because you got Rory."
"LORELAI: Look, you guys, this is a very important subject, and I promise that another time I would love to take you all for a cup of coffee and, and talk about . . .if you should even be allowed to drink coffee because coffee is for older. . . [sighs] . . .Butch Danes, everybody."
"CUT TO LANE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is standing in the hallway; Lane laughs excitedly from inside the bathroom]"
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: It's perfect, I love it."
"RORY: Well, stop primping and get out here. [Lane opens the door and reveals her purple hair] Whoa."
"LANE: It's everything I hoped it would be."
"RORY: It's very rock and roll."
"LANE: We've gotta take a picture."
"RORY: Get the camera."
"LANE: I am a Kodak picture spot."
"[they run to Lane's bedroom]"
"LANE: Should I scowl or smile?"
"RORY: Surprise me."
"LANE: This is the most radical thing a Kim has done since my cousin Nam got caught reading Maxim at summer camp."
"[Rory takes Lane's picture, then they hear the front door open]"
"RORY: That must be your mom. Lane? Lane, you're turning white. What's wrong? Lane!"
"LANE: I can't do this."
"RORY: Can't do what?"
"LANE: Dye my hair."
"RORY: Um, it's kinda too late."
"LANE: This is gonna k*ll her."
"RORY: It won't k*ll her, it'll just shock her."
"LANE: But the shock will k*ll her and then she'll k*ll me, we're talking bloodbath here. We've gotta put it back."
"RORY: Put it back?"
"LANE: Back to black, right now, hurry! Go, go!"
"RORY: Go where?"
"LANE: Back to the store to get the black hair dye."
"RORY: No!"
"LANE: Yes!"
"RORY: No!"
"LANE: Yes!"
"RORY: This is insane."
"LANE: Rory, I just drank a gallon of liquid salad. Insanity is a daily staple at the Kim house. Go, go!"
"RORY: Okay, I'm going. [walks to the door]"
"LANE: Where are you going?"
"RORY: You're messing with my mind here."
"LANE: You can't go out that way, my mom will see you."
"RORY: My head is my normal color, she can see me."
"LANE: But if she sees you, she'll come looking for me. [points to the window]"
"RORY: You owe me."
"LANE: Big time forever. Now make like the wind. Go go, go go go go!"
"CUT TO BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE"
"[Rory shops for the hair dye as Shane talks on the phone at the counter]"
"SHANE: [on phone] Uh huh. . .All I know is I don't have it, so it's gotta be at your place. . .You're not looking for it, you're watching TV, I can tell. . .Yeah, whatever. I'll just get a new one. So, what are we doing tonight? . . . I don't know, I'm sick of eating. I've been eating like a pig, I feel all bloaty. . . It is so a word, it's a word cause I said it. That's how words get invented, cause people say them and then other people say them. . . You're such a jerk sometimes and I'm always nice to you. . ."
"[Rory is waiting at the counter for Shane to help her]"
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"SHANE: [on phone] I get off at the same boring time."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"SHANE: Yeah?"
"RORY: I don't have all day."
"SHANE: [on phone] Hold on a sec. [to Rory] Will this be all?"
"RORY: Yeah, that'll be all. I'm growing a beard here."
"SHANE: What's your problem?"
"RORY: What's your problem? I'm a customer, I'm in a hurry, and you're supposed to assist me."
"SHANE: I am assisting you."
"RORY: Yeah, after you took your sweet time getting off the phone, which by the way, clearly was not a business call."
"SHANE: Un-freaking-believable."
"RORY: Yeah, it is, it is. The level of service in this place is just that  un-freaking-believable."
"SHANE: Have a nice day."
"RORY: Yeah, thanks, you too. And by the way, bloaty is not a word. There's bloated, there's bloating, but no bloaty."
"SHANE: Thanks, that's fascinating."
"RORY: Well, for you, how ice is made is probably fascinating. See ya."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Luke are walking down the street. Luke is laughing]"
"LORELAI: Don't."
"LUKE: I'm trying not to, I swear. [laughs] I'm not trying hard, I'll grant you that."
"LORELAI: What was with those kids? So curious, so full of questions. Shouldn't their brains be completely fried on TV and video games by now?"
"[Luke laughs again]"
"LORELAI: It wasn't funny."
"LUKE: Not from your angle. From mine, it was an evening at the Improv."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna be allowed within a mile of the school ever again."
"LUKE: On the positive side, you did me a favor. Now I have a pleasant memory from that school  you being nailed like a two by four by a group of sixteen-year-olds."
"[Lorelai sees Debbie and a group of women walking toward them]"
"LORELAI: Oh no, what's this?"
"LUKE: Looks like high noon in Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: They're not carrying tar and feathers, are they?"
"[the women walk up to them]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hi everybody. Wow, the whole gang. What's up?"
"DEBBIE: Well, I felt obligated to tell the other moms about your little performance at school before they heard about it elsewhere."
"LORELAI: Really, cause usually I like to meet up at Sardi's after a performance, wait for the reviews. I hope The Times liked me. Nothing, huh?"
"LADY 1: So, you're preaching to our daughters that it's okay to get pregnant at sixteen, am I getting that right?"
"LORELAI: No, not at all, I was just answering their questions."
"LADY 1: Well, it's your answers we didn't like."
"LORELAI: Hey, I was talking about my job like I was supposed to, but your kids kept asking about my pregnancy. What was I supposed to do?"
"DEBBIE: Fend them off, change the subject!"
"LORELAI: I tried, Debbie, but they kept coming at me like I was Poland and they were n*zi. Remember the old days, girls, when I used to make you laugh?"
"LADY 2: There's nothing funny about this."
"LORELAI: Their questions just threw me off, that's all."
"LADY 1: Sounds like you just flaunted your mistakes."
"LORELAI: Now, hold on. You have no right to judge me. All I said was that for my particular circumstances things worked out okay. I advocated nothing to them. You're all acting like I walked into that room tossing condoms in the air."
"LADY 2: You might as well have."
"LORELAI: Fine, next time I will. I'll bring a banana and we'll have a little show and tell. How bout that?"
"LADY 1: What kind of mother are you?"
"LORELAI: The kind that doesn't gloss over things just because they're a little uncomfortable."
"DEBBIE: This whole incident was awkward and unnecessary."
"LORELAI: No, Deb, I'd say, Deb, that what's awkward and unnecessary, Deb, is that you all seem to go to the same lousy hairdresser. How bout mixing it up a little, huh, girls?"
"LUKE: I gotta get going. You good here?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, I'm good."
"DEBBIE: You don't have to take that tone."
"LORELAI: You ambush me, then you're offended by my tone?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Jess is looking out the window as Luke walks in]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"JESS: Hey. So what's going on out there?"
"LUKE: Ah, just Lorelai. . .dealing with some women about something or other. So we did that thing at the school today. [Luke looks behind a chair] Yeah, it went pretty well. All the kids seemed relatively unarmed. [he looks into the closet] Yeah, I just told them about the diner and cooking things, and I expect kids all over town will rush out tomorrow and buy a spatula."
"JESS: Checking for monsters?"
"LUKE: Oh, no, just. . ."
"JESS: Just what?"
"LUKE: Just didn't wanna accidentally bump into someone in there."
"JESS: What are you talking about?"
"LUKE: Jess, did you have a girl stashed in there before?"
"JESS: Before what?"
"LUKE: Lorelai said you were hiding someone here earlier, she said a girl  were you?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: Jess, you don't shove a girl in a closet."
"JESS: I did not shove her in the closet. She got in voluntarily."
"LUKE: Oh, sure."
"JESS: Look, Shane freaked when she heard you guys coming. Next thing I know, she's in there. I personally didn't care if you guys saw us or not, but hey  women, right? You can't live with them, you can't keep them from jumping in the closet."
"LUKE: Uh, you and I have got to have a little talk."
"JESS: Hey, if you're gonna get all Ward Cleaver on me, I gotta go call Eddie and Lumpy and tell them I'm gonna be late."
"LUKE: Shut up for a second, would ya? Look, I know you're at an age where the whole girl thing is. . .you know, on your mind a lot, and it's probably not helping you to think straight with all the hormones and other things that are raging around in there. My point is that you gotta think about things a little better, you know, the way you act. I mean, if you care about a girl the way you do with this Shane "
"JESS: I don't care about her."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: I don't even know her last name."
"LUKE: You're kidding."
"JESS: She mentioned it once. It didn't stick."
"LUKE: Well, if you don't care about her, what are you doing with her?"
"JESS: Just hanging with her, no biggie."
"LUKE: Well, you gotta be doing something more than hanging with her. I mean, you got to at least be doing something with her to make her jump in a closet when people come into the room."
"JESS: Relax, will ya? All is good."
"LUKE: Jess, this isn't right. You can't treat a girl like this, like dirt!"
"JESS: If it's any consolation to you, she treats me like dirt, too. It's a pretty symbiotic relationship."
"LUKE: And that's fine with you?"
"JESS: Yes, it is."
"LUKE: To just go along in a relationship, you treat somebody bad and they treat you bad back."
"JESS: That's right."
"LUKE: Oh, that makes you happy?"
"JESS: I'd do backflips but I am way too cool."
"LUKE: That makes absolutely no sense."
"JESS: It doesn't have to make sense to you."
"LUKE: There are plenty other of girls out there in the world, Jess."
"JESS: Don't you have to get back to the diner?"
"LUKE: I mean, you can go out and at least find one that you actually care about."
"JESS: Oh, like it's that easy."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's that easy if you try."
"JESS: Hey, the girls that I like don't give a damn about me! And unlike some other people I know, I'm not gonna sit around hoping that they change their minds and suddenly notice me."
"LUKE: What's that supposed to mean?"
"JESS: You fixed any neighbor's porches lately? Or you go on a picnic or you get rooked into giving a ridiculous speech at a high school?"
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: At least I've got a little self-esteem."
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: I'm not playing Golden Retriever, hoping one day she'll turn around and fall in my arms. If she doesn't wanna be with me, then fine."
"LUKE: You have no idea what you're talking about."
"JESS: Whatever. I gotta go, Shane's waiting."
"LUKE: Oh, you mean what's-her-name?"
"JESS: Yeah, I'll bring you a new leash when I get back."
"LUKE: Get outta here."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"LANE: Busy day, busy day."
"RORY: I'm pretty exhausted."
"LANE: I guess it was just too big of a statement for me to make right now."
"RORY: Maybe. Oh, hey, I just thought of something."
"LANE: What?"
"RORY: Technically, you have dyed hair."
"LANE: I do, don't I?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LANE: I mean, dyed my natural color, yes  but dyed nonetheless."
"RORY: Not one strand of real color on that head of yours."
"LANE: So, I guess that means we can score this as a victory, right?"
"RORY: Absolutely, put it in the victory column."
"[Jess and Shane walk past them]"
"SHANE: That girl's a freak."
"LANE: What was that about?"
"RORY: It's been a very long day."
"[Lorelai walks up to them]"
"LORELAI: Ah, people who like me, great."
"RORY: How was your talk at the school?"
"LORELAI: Oh, just peachy. [to Lane] Is your hair blacker?"
"LANE: Uh oh."
"RORY: Oh, I wish you hadn't have said that. It's not noticeable, but just stay out of bright lighting."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"LANE: I dyed my hair."
"LORELAI: Uh!"
"LANE: Then I dyed it back, but for a full thirty minutes, I looked like this. [pulls out the picture]"
"LORELAI: Whoa, you look cool! You're insane."
"LANE: I got sane again, but I will always have that picture. Oh, uh, hide it at your place?"
"LORELAI: Will do."
"LANE: I gotta go. And remember, we still need a plan."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do."
"[Lane leaves]"
"LORELAI: Why do we need a plan?"
"RORY: A plan so that Lane doesn't have to quit her band."
"LORELAI: Lane can't quit the band! She has to get famous and introduce me to Bono."
"RORY: I told her that."
"LORELAI: All right, let's go eat. . .see if we can figure out a way to salvage my future as a groupie."
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: Let's go to Al's Pancake World for a change. He's doing a salute to Jamaica again."
"RORY: Okay, as long as Al doesn't play the kettle drums all night."
"LORELAI: We'll hide his mallets when he's not looking."
"RORY: So, come on, tell me how the talk went."
"LORELAI: Oh, it was great. It was one minute on my success in the business world, and that went very well. And it was ten minutes on the possibility that if I had had sex with a different man at a different time in my life, you wouldn't have been born."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I kind of got off on a tangent."
"RORY: A big one. How did that happen?"
"LORELAI: I'll tell you about it at Al's. Just don't expect to be invited to any more swim parties at Kathy Fincher's house."
"RORY: Well, don't wait til Al's. Tell me now."
"LORELAI: Oh, I just love my little fluke."
"RORY: Come on, what happened?"
"LORELAI: All right. Well, it started off really good and then all these kids started asking me all these questions, you know, about like. . . ."

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street toward the diner]"
"LORELAI: And the rabbit says, How about that schnitzel!' Well?"
"RORY: Well what? There's no punchline."
"LORELAI: That is the punchline."
"RORY: How about that schnitzel!'  that's the punchline?"
"LORELAI: Well, no, not when you say it like that."
"RORY: How am I supposed to say it?"
"LORELAI: Like a punchline."
"RORY: How about that schnitzel!"
"LORELAI: Oh, forget it."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You ruined my joke."
"RORY: Um, no, the punchline ruined your joke."
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You admit it's a punchline."
"RORY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Ha, I am vindicated. How about that schnitzel!' has officially been declared a punchline."
"RORY: A really bad punchline."
"LORELAI: No one asked for the Norton Critical Edition. All the schnitzel and I wanted was some recognition and now we have it."
"[they walk into Luke's Diner]"
"LORELAI: Oh, man, it's packed in here."
"RORY: I guess we counter it."
"LORELAI: Oh, I guess we do."
"[they sit down at the counter]"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: What do you know, your face really can freeze that way."
"RORY: Are you okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm great. It's a big fat happy sunshine day for me."
"LORELAI: Business looks good."
"RORY: Yeah, the place is packed."
"LUKE: Sure, it's been taken over by the J. Crew catalog."
"[Several families with little kids are seated at the tables]"
"RORY: Oh, look, babies!"
"LORELAI: I never wanna hear that come out of your mouth again."
"WOMAN: Find the yellow ball."
"MAN: [searching through a diaper bag] Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball. . .ah, yellow duck."
"WOMAN: Ball."
"MAN: Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball."
"LUKE: Every weekend, the same stupid group comes in here and take up all my tables and every chair they can get their sticky hands on, and they do that. They sit, they stand, one person holds the kid, another person holds the kid."
"MAN 2: I've got Choo-Choo Joe."
"LUKE: This guy runs in and out and back and forth, the other guy never takes his head out of that stupid bag, the women can't figure out which kid is which, and they do it all morning long, and then order two iced teas to go, and that is it."
"LORELAI: I'm sure you're exaggerating."
"LUKE: I am not exaggerating."
"WOMAN 2: Oh god."
"LUKE: Oh, now, this is good, you see  Choo-Choo Joe will not be working."
"WOMAN 2: Get the Bongo Bear. Get the Bongo Bear."
"RORY: How'd you know that?"
"LUKE: Because Joe has not been working for the last six months. Personally, I don't think he's broken, I think he k*ll himself to get away from that family."
"LORELAI: Oh, now that kid's a major drooler."
"RORY: Yeah, it's like a fountain."
"LUKE: Okay, that's it, they have to go."
"LORELAI: Luke, come on, it's just spit. Pretend you're at a baseball game."
"LUKE: No no no, I've had enough. Let them go not spend money at Al's, I'm through."
"[He starts to walk toward the people when a woman stands up and starts unbuttoning her shirt. Luke walks back to Lorelai and Rory]"
"LUKE: Is that woman doing what I think she's doing?"
"[the woman has started nursing her baby]"
"LORELAI: Um, well, I can't be a hundred percent sure, but. . .oh yeah, that's lunch."
"LUKE: Why, why do they do this? This is a public place, people are eating here."
"RORY: They sure are."
"LUKE: This cannot be sanitary."
"LORELAI: I agree. You don't know where that thing's been."
"LUKE: When did that become acceptable? In the old days, a woman would never consider doing that in public. They'd go find a barn or a cave or something. I mean, it's indecent. This is a diner not a peep show!"
"LORELAI: Hey, consider making it a combo. You could charge more for your cheeseburgers. Of course, no one would ever feel the same ordering a glass of milk again, but . . ."
"LUKE: I have to do something. I just can't stand here and let the lactating continue."
"LORELAI: Luke."
"RORY: Gross!"
"LUKE: I'm gross? I'm not the one exposing myself for the entire world to see. That's it."
"[Luke starts to walk over to the woman, then walks back to the counter]"
"LUKE: You go make her stop."
"LORELAI: I'm not going over there."
"LUKE: Why not? You're a woman."
"LORELAI: So what?"
"LUKE: So you have the same parts."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You shouldn't be scared of it."
"LORELAI: Scared of it? You know, you're gonna be a bachelor for a really long time."
"LUKE: I am being taken advantage of here, and I do not like being taken advantage of. I hate this!"
"[Jess walks down into the diner and sees the woman nursing]"
"JESS: Oh geez!"
"[Jess quickly turns around and walks back upstairs]"
"LUKE: Okay, well, that was kind of fun."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks into the lobby as Michel walks in from another direction carrying some pillows]"
"LORELAI: Aw, is it your nap time?"
"MICHEL: The Tylers in twelve asked to have their toxic pillows removed."
"LORELAI: Our pillows aren't toxic."
"MICHEL: According to the complimentary travel magazine that we put in their room, down pillows can carry airborne diseases and mold."
"LORELAI: Unbelievable  I didn't think anyone ever read those magazines."
"MICHEL: I think she had to, there was a picture of a roast chicken on the cover."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: She is large."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: And her husband in ugly."
"LORELAI: Hey!"
"MICHEL: They threw pillows at me!"
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Independence inn."
"EMILY: You really should identify yourself when you answer the phone at work."
"LORELAI: Sorry. Independence Inn, major disappointment speaking. Better?"
"EMILY: Yes, thank you. Now I wanna talk to you about something."
"LORELAI: sh**t."
"EMILY: I'm in charge of the Society Matron's League's annual antique auction next Tuesday and I thought maybe you'd like to come."
"LORELAI: Society Matron's League? That's quite a name."
"EMILY: And what is wrong with that name, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Nothing, it just sounds so serious. Brings to mind a room full of old ladies wearing black dresses and cameos and pushing spoonfuls of cod liver oil on the kids."
"EMILY: That's a very flattering portrait of my friends you're painting."
"LORELAI: I didn't mean your friends. I meant the other old ladies in the league, the ones who don't like you and your friends cause you guys are so young."
"EMILY: Kindly wrap this up soon, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Consider it wrapped."
"EMILY: Thank you. As I was saying, all the proceeds from the auction go to the children's hospital, and we're going to be offering some lovely pieces which I think would like very nice in that inn of yours."
"LORELAI: What sort of pieces?"
"EMILY: Basically a lot canes and shawls, a couple of walkers. I believe we finally talked Old Lady Rollins into giving up her teeth."
"LORELAI: What sort of pieces, Mom?"
"EMILY: We have a couple of wonderful writing desks, and some French end tables, rocking chairs, picture frames, lamps, davenports."
"LORELAI: Well"
"EMILY: The worst that can happen is you won't find anything you like and you've wasted a couple of hours. And who knows, you might find something you love. Plus, I will be way too busy to sit with you if that is of concern."
"LORELAI: That is not a concern. Define way too busy.'"
"EMILY: Are you interested or not?"
"LORELAI: When is this auction?"
"EMILY: Tuesday at one o'clock."
"LORELAI: I'll think about it."
"EMILY: I'll see you Tuesday."
"LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up]"
"MICHEL: I'm sorry, did I hear you mention something about an auction?"
"LORELAI: Uh, my mother's women's group is having one next week."
"MICHEL: Oh, well, you know  I love a good auction. The drama, the strategy."
"LORELAI: The strategy?"
"MICHEL: Oh, yes. First, you mustn't be too eager because that drives the price way up."
"LORELAI: Don't be too eager, got it."
"MICHEL: And you must always be extremely careful of your paddle movements."
"LORELAI: Well, that certainly calls for a ""Dirty!"""
"MICHEL: Mm, how's your arm raise? Good?"
"LORELAI: Pretty good."
"MICHEL: Ah, I have an excellent arm raise."
"LORELAI: That's what it says on the bathroom wall."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, if you need some tips. . ."
"LORELAI: I'll give you a call."
"MICHEL: Good. Take me to the auction!"
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: Take me, I insist you take me!"
"LORELAI: You don't even know if it's gonna be any good. It's just a bunch of society women."
"MICHEL: If your mother's involved, it will be impeccable and I haven't been to an impeccable auction in over a year."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know."
"MICHEL: What do you want?"
"LORELAI: Michel, I don't want anything."
"MICHEL: Stop playing coy with me. I want into that auction, you name your price."
"LORELAI: Okay, you have to work weekends for the rest of this month."
"MICHEL: Done."
"LORELAI: And you have to answer the phone when it rings."
"MICHEL: Done."
"LORELAI: And you have to answer it in English, unless the person is actually foreign."
"MICHEL: Done."
"LORELAI: And you have to oversee the nature hikers next week."
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: Michel, if you wanna go to this auction, you have to be in the lobby at six o'clock Friday morning. You have to hand out towels and water bottles, you have to show them the hiking trails, and you have to let them give you a nature name."
"MICHEL: Fine, I will let them give me a nature name."
"LORELAI: All right, then, you can come."
"MICHEL: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Buttercup."
"MICHEL: You cannot give them suggestions!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory get out of the Jeep; Lorelai is carrying a pizza, Rory is carrying a brown takeout bag]"
"RORY: I can't believe you got into a fight with Pete."
"LORELAI: Hey, you do not suddenly decide that garlic is an extra topping, not after five years, not after all we've been through. We single-handedly helped Pete pay for that new delivery truck of his, and I thought he needed to be reminded of that fact."
"RORY: Very loudly."
"LORELAI: Not that loudly."
"RORY: Dogs started barking."
"LORELAI: Because they heard about the garlic incident, and no one likes getting screwed, Rory, not even a Schnauzer. Pete's a swindler. He takes advantage of single mothers and their innocent children and for that, he must pay  what?"
"RORY: He gave us free cheesy bread."
"LORELAI: He did? Oh!"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: I love the cheesy bread."
"RORY: I know you do."
"LORELAI: It's all hot, too."
"RORY: Now doesn't someone feel a little silly?"
"LORELAI: Me?"
"RORY: Should we call Pete tonight?"
"LORELAI: Okay, after cheesy bread."
"RORY: Fine, after the cheesy bread."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna go get the mail  go on inside."
"RORY: Okay, I'm gonna go melt some more cheese on the pizza."
"LORELAI: Melt away."
"[Rory goes inside. Lorelai walks to the mailbox as a man walks across the yard]"
"DWIGHT: Hey! Hello there, neighbor!"
"LORELAI: Hi. I'm sorry, are we neighbors?"
"DWIGHT: Yes, yes we are. I just moved in across the way."
"LORELAI: Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Beenie Morrison's old place."
"DWIGHT: That's right, Beenie Morrison's old place."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"DWIGHT: Beenie Morrison's old place. I live in Beenie Morrison's old place. Isn't that great?"
"LORELAI: Only if Beenie Morrison didn't want to live there anymore."
"DWIGHT: Oh no, I paid him a very good price. Overpaid, actually, but it was worth it. I've been dreaming about a place like Beenie Morrison's old place for a long time, and then I found it. I'm sorry, I'm just really excited."
"LORELAI: That's okay, it's nice."
"DWIGHT: It's a great neighborhood."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"DWIGHT: Everyone's so friendly. Babette  do you know Babette?"
"LORELAI: Everybody knows Babette."
"DWIGHT: Oh, she's a great lady. Oh, uh, anyhow, I'm Dwight."
"LORELAI: I'm Lorelai. And if you see a teen walking around with a halo and a book, that's my daughter Rory."
"DWIGHT: Very nice to meet you, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Nice to meet you too, Dwight. Welcome to the neighborhood. If there's anything I can do to help out, let me know."
"DWIGHT: Really?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"DWIGHT: Well, that's great. Actually, I have this little favor I'd love to ask."
"LORELAI: Oh, right now?"
"DWIGHT: Well, this week. You know, I just got this beautiful lawn put in, really amazing shade of green, and the guy who put it in for me, he told me that I have to keep each bade of grass very moist for the first few days while the roots take, but I have to go on a business trip for a few days. Huh, last minute, and believe me, I tried to get out of it but my boss said, Dwight, get off your keister and go make us some money', so I gotta go."
"LORELAI: Well, sure, when the word keister's being thrown around, what are you gonna do?"
"DWIGHT: Exactly. So I was wondering if maybe you could water my lawn?"
"LORELAI: Oh."
"DWIGHT: Only for a few days. You know, a little in the morning, a little in the late afternoon or evening, depending on your schedule. It would be a really big favor."
"LORELAI: Uh, well, I guess, I could water your lawn, Dwight  sure."
"DWIGHT: Boy, that is something. If I would have asked somebody back where I used to live to water my lawn, I would've gotten a much more HBO kind of answer. I love it here! Uh, so, uh, can you come on over now?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"DWIGHT: So I can show you where the on/off nozzle is. It'll only take a second."
"LORELAI: Oh, my daughter's waiting inside for me, I "
"DWIGHT: Oh, uh, well, we can do it tomorrow before I leave."
"LORELAI: Great. What time are you leaving tomorrow?"
"DWIGHT: Six a.m."
"LORELAI: Now sounds fine."
"DWIGHT: That's so terrific. Uh, follow me."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Lorelai follows Dwight across the yard]"
"DWIGHT: You just gotta go over here and make a right."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know where it is."
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai follows Dwight up the front pathway of his house]"
"DWIGHT: Welcome to The Oasis! That's what I named this place, The Oasis, my oasis, a little slice of heaven right here on Earth. Gosh, I swear, I still can't believe I'm here. I was in a terrible marriage, you know."
"LORELAI: Actually, I didn't."
"DWIGHT: Oh, yeah, horrible, like a punishment out of Greek mythology. The women had five heads, suffering, agony. You know, I used to be taller?"
"LORELAI: Really, she shrunk you?"
"DWIGHT: I used to have more hair, too."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"DWIGHT: And higher arches."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"DWIGHT: But through all the screaming and the name calling, the berating and the humiliation, somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew someday I would have it  my oasis. Oh, that's what got me through. That's what kept me from sticking my head through a plate glass window every night when I got home."
"LORELAI: Well, that's a really nice story, Dwight. It's very inspiring and. . .oh, hey, this looks like it does something."
"DWIGHT: Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, this is the on/off spigot."
"LORELAI: Aha."
"DWIGHT: You just turn it to the right for on."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"DWIGHT: And the left for off."
"LORELAI: Seems simple."
"DWIGHT: It's very simple."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, twice a day."
"DWIGHT: Yeah, for a good fifteen minute soaking."
"LORELAI: I will soak my best."
"DWIGHT: I really appreciate it."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, you have a good trip."
"DWIGHT: I owe ya."
"[Lorelai walks back to her house; Rory is waiting on the porch]"
"RORY: Where have you been?"
"LORELAI: Get in the house."
"RORY: I thought you were gonna go get the mail."
"LORELAI: Go, go, go!"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Don't look around, stare straight ahead, no more talking to people ever!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"[Lorelai pushes Rory into the house]"
"CUT TO AUCTION"
"[An auctioneer stands on a stage running the auction; Lorelai and Michel are sitting in the audience.]"
"AUCTIONEER: Next up, we have an occasional table from a distinguished, family-owned company in Vermont, circa 1912. We shall start the bidding at two hundred-fifty dollars. Do I hear two-fifty? Two hundred fifty, thank you."
"LORELAI: Wow, lots of garbage at these things."
"MICHEL: Always. You've got to be patient and wait for what you want to appear, then pounce."
"LORELAI: Hm, true at an auction, true at a singles bar."
"MICHEL: To put it crudely, yes."
"LORELAI: Crap, crap, crap that makes the previous two items not seem like crap."
"MICHEL: Could you keep your crap commentaries to yourself?"
"AUCTIONEER: Four hundred dollars, we have four hundred, four hundred  going once, going twice, sold to bidder number sixty-five."
"LORELAI: Aw, wow, that was a good table."
"MICHEL: It was a good table, not a great table."
"LORELAI: We should've gone for it."
"MICHEL: Too expensive and too many scratches."
"LORELAI: We could've buffed the scratches out."
"MICHEL: Look, if you want it that bad, it's quite obvious that the buyer's children will be selling it at his probate in the very near future."
"LORELAI: You're awful."
"MICHEL: And he's old, now be quiet."
"[Emily walks over to them]"
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey Mom, you remember Michel?"
"EMILY: Yes, from the inn."
"MICHEL: Hello Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: Didn't you see me waving at you before?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"EMILY: You didn't wave back."
"LORELAI: It's dangerous to wave at an auction. You didn't see before, but when you waved you bought a motorcycle and a sidecar."
"EMILY: I did not."
"LORELAI: Circa 1912. Now would you drive it or would you sit in the sidecar?"
"[A woman walks up to them]"
"NATALIE: There she is, the Cobra."
"EMILY: Oh, now, Natalie."
"LORELAI: The what?"
"NATALIE: This woman gets her way or she squeezes til you comply."
"LORELAI: Like a superhero."
"EMILY: Ignore her, Natalie is just being Natalie. My daughter, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Nice to meet you."
"NATALIE: Your mother's got such spunk. You must love her."
"LORELAI: I think she'd squeeze me to death if I didn't."
"EMILY: Natalie, you're embarrassing me."
"NATALIE: Oh, hush, Emily. Listen to this. . . our auctioneer calls in sick this morning, they are such flakes, and what is an auction without an auctioneer?"
"LORELAI: Just a bunch of nuts with paddles surrounded by mismatched furniture?"
"NATALIE: Exactly. But your mother got on the horn with that lazy Charlie and she squeezed and squeezed til  voila  he suddenly felt better. The Cobra."
"LORELAI: The Cobra."
"EMILY: Oh, now, stop it."
"NATALIE: You're humble, don't be. Nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"NATALIE: Edna's group wants to give you kudos, too, Emily. Make sure to swing by."
"EMILY: I will."
"[Natalie leaves]"
"EMILY: I should make the rounds. Say goodbye before you leave."
"LORELAI: Hm, I will, Cobra."
"EMILY: Stop it."
"LORELAI: It goes with the motorcycle thing, too."
"[Emily walks away, Lorelai sits down]"
"AUCTIONEER: Do I have two hundred-fifty? Two hundred-fifty, thank you. Do I have three hundred? Three hundred, thank you very much."
"LORELAI: Oh, is this our end tables?"
"MICHEL: Shh!"
"AUCTIONEER: Moving on to three-fifty? Three-fifty, do we have four?"
"LORELAI: Let me do the paddle."
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: I just wanna hold it, it's still your thing."
"MICHEL: I'm losing my concentration."
"LORELAI: Fine. I'm gonna go get a drink."
"MICHEL: Please."
"AUCTIONEER: Do we have five hundred?"
"[Lorelai walks up to the bar as a man is ordering a drink]"
"PEYTON: Can I get a Merlot, please?"
"BARTENDER: Yes sir."
"LORELAI: Oh, that sounds great, make it two."
"BARTENDER: [pouring drink] Got just enough for one and this is the last of the red, sorry."
"LORELAI: Aw. I'll give you two bucks for it."
"BARTENDER: They're free."
"LORELAI: Which makes two bucks a great offer, and this is an auction, right?"
"BARTENDER: Yes."
"PEYTON: Three."
"BARTENDER: What?"
"PEYTON: I'll give you three for it."
"LORELAI: Four."
"PEYTON: Five."
"LORELAI: Six."
"PEYTON: Six-fifty"
"LORELAI: Ooh, losing steam."
"PEYTON: Just weighing cost versus benefit."
"LORELAI: Well, you've gotta think about these things."
"PEYTON: How about this? Can I get an empty glass?"
"BARTENDER: Yes, sir."
"[Peyton pours some of the wine into the second glass]"
"LORELAI: Aw. You're the Solomon of wine."
"PEYTON: Everybody's gotta be something. I got a few things coming up that I'm bidding on."
"LORELAI: Oh, oh. Great, the bartender and I are the only ones in the building that don't get to hold a paddle."
"PEYTON: Why don't you put a bid on one of the paddles?"
"LORELAI: What would I use to bid on it?"
"PEYTON: I'm Solomon, not Einstein."
"LORELAI: Bye Solomon."
"[Peyton walks away as the bartender pulls out another bottle of wine]"
"BARTENDER: Oops, I had a spare bottle all the time."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks. This was better."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen while talking on the phone]"
"LORELAI: Hi, yes, I was at your auction yesterday and I was wondering if you could help me. Um, I met a man there and I would like to contact him but I didn't get his name and I wondered if you could look it up for me. He was paddle number seventeen, and. . .Oh right, confidential, got it. . .Well, you know, actually, I misspoke earlier because this isn't a complete stranger I'm trying to contact here, he's an old friend from school. . . Good question. Well, I don't know his name because I only knew him by his nickname. . .Uh, Shamu. We called him Shamu. He was kind of, um, a big guy in high school, but he's slimmed down quite a bit. . .No, see, I don't have time to contact the high school alumni committee because time is of the essence. . . See, Shamu and I went to a liquor store after the auction and we bought a lottery ticket together and we tore it and I took half and he took half, and I'll be damned if the thing didn't win! . . .Fourteen million dollars! . . .Really, but see, we have to claim it by four p.m. today or we forfeit. . .Ah, yes. . .Oh, well, but there's one more thing that I forgot to tell you. See, um, my blood type is o-negative and he's o-negative and I have a medical condition that. . .All right, then. Well, thank you anyway. Bye. [hangs up]"
"RORY: So. . ."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"RORY: You ran into your old friend Shamu?"
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"RORY: And you won millions of dollars?"
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: And you need a transfusion?"
"LORELAI: I'm just trying to get the name of a really cool guy I met at this auction, but they won't give it to me."
"RORY: Wow, that's a lot of effort. Must've been cute."
"LORELAI: And witty  you don't meet that everyday."
"RORY: You know who would have his name?"
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: Grandma."
"LORELAI: Ah, no, she only knows the Bitty's, she doesn't know the young ones."
"RORY: She knows everyone at these kinds of things. You know Grandma."
"LORELAI: I cannot ask her for this."
"RORY: Then kiss Shamu goodbye."
"LORELAI: But maybe you could ask her."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Come on, ask her, do me a favor!"
"RORY: You want me to ask Grandma for the name of a man that I didn't meet at a function that I didn't attend?"
"LORELAI: I'll share my lottery winnings with you."
"RORY: It's ridiculously transparent."
"LORELAI: Fourteen million dollars."
"RORY: But you're sharing half with him and taxes will take a huge chunk, and oh yeah  you didn't win the lottery. Ask her yourself."
"LORELAI: You're mean."
"RORY: Did you call information and ask them for paddle seventeen's listing?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily and Richard are eating dinner]"
"EMILY: What do you think of the pork? Rory?"
"RORY: It's good."
"EMILY: I'm not sure. Richard?"
"RICHARD: It's fine."
"EMILY: I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: It's really good, Mom."
"EMILY: Yes, well, I'm not sure."
"RICHARD: Pork is bred leaner these days. It has a different taste. Less fat equals less flavor. Yet another example of the great advances man has made, flavorless pork. Hurrah for the opposable thumbs."
"EMILY: All right, enough talk about pork. Please, someone change the subject."
"RORY: Mom had a really good time at the auction the other day."
"EMILY: Did you?"
"LORELAI: Yes, yes, I did."
"EMILY: Well, I'm glad. Did you see anything you liked?"
"RORY: Yeah, Mom, anything look good to you there?"
"LORELAI: Yes, actually, I, uh, bought a couple of end tables for the inn."
"EMILY: I must say I was very impressed with the selection this year. I even wound up purchasing a couple of pieces for myself."
"RICHARD: Yes, how nice to have yet another chair you can't sit in."
"EMILY: It's one hundred years old."
"RICHARD: Wonderful. We can put it next to the two-hundred-year-old footstool you can't put your foot on."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard, please."
"RICHARD: I'm only teasing, Emily. It is one of the great pleasures of my life to be able to surround you with a house full of useless objects. No, I'm never happier than when we're standing in the corner staring at our furniture."
"EMILY: Eat your pork, please."
"RORY: You know, I believe there was something at the auction that Mom wanted but she didn't get. Isn't that right, Mom?"
"EMILY: Oh really? What was that?"
"LORELAI: I think it was a steamer trunk for Rory to take with her to military school, wasn't it, honey?"
"EMILY: I don't remember a steamer trunk, but I can check on it for you if you like."
"LORELAI: That's not necessary, Mom. Uh, so, Mom, it was a very nice bunch of people you had at that auction."
"EMILY: Yes, very nice."
"LORELAI: I was surprised at how many young people were there. I mean, you know, younger people. Um, in fact, uh, like, for instance, this guy that I talked to for quite awhile, he was. . .younger."
"EMILY: What man was that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I didn't get his name, but he was a nice looking guy. He had a gray suit and he was paddle number seventeen. He likes Merlot."
"EMILY: Are you talking about Peyton Sanders?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know, maybe."
"EMILY: Wait one second, I'll look it up."
"LORELAI: Oh, no no no, Mom, you don't have to . . .she's looking it up."
"EMILY: Paddle number seventeen, Peyton Sanders."
"LORELAI: Oh great, oh, Peyton Sanders. Well, that's great that it's Peyton Sanders. . . cause that's, uh, great. How well do you know this Peyton Sanders?"
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Why do you wanna know how well I know Peyton Sanders?"
"LORELAI: I don't wanna know. I was just mentioning that he was, you know, seemed. . .uh, you know. . ."
"EMILY: Young."
"LORELAI: Yes, young. Okay, Mom, uh, Peyton and I kind of hit it off and I wondered if you possibly had his number. . .okay, there, I said it. Pass the flavorless pork."
"EMILY: You're asking me for his number?"
"LORELAI: If it's not a big deal, then yes."
"EMILY: Well, well, well. Richard, Lorelai's asking me for a man's number."
"RICHARD: So I heard."
"LORELAI: But if it's a big deal, forget it."
"EMILY: It's not a big deal at all. I don't have his number."
"LORELAI: Okay, then, never mind."
"EMILY: I can get his number. Would you like me to get his number?"
"LORELAI: Um, it's up to you."
"EMILY: It can't be up to me. I didn't ask for his number, you asked for his number, therefore it has to be up to you as to whether or not I get his number."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom."
"EMILY: Would you like me to get his number?"
"LORELAI: Yes, if you don't mind."
"EMILY: I don't mind at all."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"EMILY: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: I wasn't kidding about that military school."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai rushes down the steps]"
"LORELAI: Okay, the clock is right! If we hurry, we still have time to hit Luke's for breakfast. What'd I forget?"
"RORY: [rushing into the living room] Pants."
"LORELAI: Uh! Ooh, don't do that. Come on, let's go!"
"RORY: I can't."
"LORELAI: You can't have breakfast? You have to have breakfast."
"RORY: The clock is wrong, I'll miss my bus."
"LORELAI: Forget your bus, I'll drive you to school."
"RORY: You will?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Oh sh**t!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Dwight's lawn."
"RORY: Aw, there goes the breakfast sandwich."
"LORELAI: No, no, let's hurry, we can still do Luke's."
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Let's go!"
"RORY: Agh, my shoes!"
"LORELAI: You don't need shoes! In my day, we walked twenty miles in the snow just to get to our shoes!"
"RORY: Aw, come on."
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up the front pathway.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, come on, sprinkle. [turns on the sprinkler] There, drink up boys, we've got a breakfast to get to."
"[Rory walks to the porch and finds an envelope]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I think this is for you."
"LORELAI: Lorelai? No, it must be someone else. Hey, don't read that. Do not read that. I'm telling you, no good can come from you reading that."
"RORY: Dear Lorelai. . .'"
"LORELAI: And she's reading it."
"RORY: Just a couple of things that came to mind after we talked.'"
"LORELAI: Oh great."
"RORY: First of all, thank you for this very kind favor you're doing me. I still can't believe that any one person would be so kind to someone they just met.'"
"LORELAI: Yeah, apparently Dwight's last home was Oz, and not as in The Wizard Of.'"
"RORY: Second, since you are already coming over to take care of my lawn, I was hoping you wouldn't mind stopping inside and watering my African violets. I have written the directions on a separate piece of paper, there's a key in the planter by the door. Please go in, make yourself at home. I have food in the fridge, satellite TV, and a great collection of board games. My oasis is your oasis.'"
"LORELAI: I'm not going in that house. Rory, do not pick up that key."
"RORY: But we have to water the violets."
"LORELAI: No, I didn't agree to violets. He threw the violets in after he'd already rooked me into watering his lawn."
"RORY: Don't you at least wanna see what his house looks like?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely not. Key, please. Let me just say, if we walk in there and his dead mother is sitting in a rocking chair, not a bit surprised."
"[cut to inside Dwight's house]"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, Dwight."
"RORY: This place is great."
"LORELAI: Someone took the whole lounge craze very seriously."
"[they see a large cabinet filled with board games]"
"RORY: Oh my."
"LORELAI: Oh geez, he wasn't kidding."
"RORY: I have never seen this many board games. He's got Monopoly from every country in the world."
"LORELAI: Hey, when you finally meet him?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Remember he owns Twister  there's a great visual awaiting you."
"RORY: Got it. Hey, how come we don't have a tiki bar?"
"LORELAI: Well, we are not two wild and crazy guys."
"RORY: You like pina coladas."
"LORELAI: And getting lost in the rain."
"RORY: I love it here."
"LORELAI: It's quite a statement, I'll give him that."
"RORY: Hey, African violets."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, right. [cell phone rings] Just a sec. [answers phone] Hello?. . .Hi Peyton, thanks for calling me back. . .Well, I hope it was a good surprise. [whispers to Rory] It was a good surprise."
"RORY: Yay."
"LORELAI: [on phone] You just flew back on your jet, huh? . . .From Maui? Sounds great. . . Yes, I would love to get together with you. . .Um, I'm pretty flexible next week. What'd you have in mind? . . . David Bowie?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I love David Bowie, I would love to go. . . Oh, well, yeah, it is a ways away, but. . .No, I think that sounds just crazy enough."
"RORY: What sounds crazy enough?"
"LORELAI: Well, that sounds great, Peyton. It's a plan. . . I'll see you then, okay, bye. [hangs up] We're having dinner tomorrow."
"RORY: What were you saying about David Bowie?"
"LORELAI: Well, first, he asked me to the David Bowie concert next week."
"RORY: You're so lucky!"
"LORELAI: I know! And once that was set, he said that a week was an awfully long time to wait."
"RORY: He did not."
"LORELAI: So we're having dinner tomorrow."
"RORY: And Bowie next week."
"LORELAI: And Bowie next week."
"RORY: Two dates in one phone call. Talk about not wasting any time."
"LORELAI: He sounds very cool, and not just cause he owns his own jet."
"RORY: Well, remember to tell him that the way to get to you is through your daughter, who desperately wants to go to Amsterdam."
"LORELAI: I will remember."
"RORY: I think this place is lucky."
"LORELAI: I think you may be right. Of course, creepy's the other word that comes to mind."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is getting dressed in the closet as Rory reads on the bed]"
"LORELAI: [from inside the closet] The red skirt is not working."
"RORY: Try the blue."
"LORELAI: Blue let me down ten minutes ago, I think it's conspiring with the red."
"RORY: I wish you'd just wear the dress we picked out this morning."
"LORELAI: No, you know as well as I do, the morning butt and evening butt are two completely different butts."
"RORY: Well, whatever butt you've got tonight had better hurry because he's gonna be here any minute."
"LORELAI: Rats. Fine, okay, striped skirt, g*n sweater, that's it. [walks out of closet] What do you think? And remember, I'm wearing this no matter what because I cannot spend one more second deciding what to wear, so the answer has to be, You look fantastic.'"
"RORY: You look fantastic."
"LORELAI: [grabs a shirt from the bed] Pink and black."
"RORY: With a flippy skirt."
"LORELAI: Grab a necklace?"
"[Lorelai walks back into the closet to change]"
"LORELAI: Um, okay, here is my concern."
"RORY: Voice it."
"LORELAI: Well, you know, I only saw this guy once for like ten minutes and the lighting was only so-so and I hadn't eaten anything, and, like, what if I'm remembering him a lot cuter than he was?"
"RORY: I'm sure you're not."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but what if I am? You know how these things are. You get bored, you need a diversion, so you superimpose a really cute guy's face over a really scary looking guy."
"RORY: Well, then you'll just have to strike up a conversation with him and find out what kind of a man he is beneath the surface."
"LORELAI: What? On the first date  what will he think of me?"
"RORY: Just order an extra dessert."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine. Well?"
"RORY: I like the brown."
"LORELAI: Come here a sec, you've got some dirt on your forehead. I'm sorry, it's just the sign of the devil, my mistake."
"RORY: You look beautiful."
"LORELAI: Thank you. [they hear a car pull up] I think that's him. [they look out the window] Well, the car sure is pretty."
"RORY: Come on."
"[cut to them walking down the stairs]"
"LORELAI: Okay now, if for some reason, he does turn out to have like a horn in the middle of his forehead, you will call me in one hour with a very high fever."
"RORY: Deal."
"LORELAI: God, I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?"
"RORY: Because you're crazy."
"LORELAI: Yes, good, thank you."
"[Lorelai pulls open the door]"
"PEYTON: Hi."
"LORELAI: [to Rory] You're feeling just fine. [to Peyton] Hey Peyton."
"PEYTON: Am I early?"
"LORELAI: No, you're right on time. Peyton, I want you to meet my daughter, Rory."
"PEYTON: It's a pleasure, Rory."
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, don't wait up and remember only two or three crackheads at the most, they eat all the good cereal."
"RORY: Deal. Have fun."
"PEYTON: It was nice meeting you, Rory. [to Lorelai] You look wonderful."
"LORELAI: Oh, so do you Peyton. So do you."
"CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory is in bed, Lorelai knocks on the door]"
"LORELAI: You up?"
"RORY: What time is it?"
"LORELAI: 10:15."
"RORY: Oops."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: What happened? He was hornless."
"[Lorelai sits down on Rory's bed]"
"LORELAI: No, he had no horns, he also had no personality."
"RORY: Yikes."
"LORELAI: And no sense of humor."
"RORY: Gross."
"LORELAI: And no idea how boring he was."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: That's okay. The evening started well enough  that is, until we got to the car. . .a Jaguar XJ8 convertible with a 290 horsepower engine, in case you were wondering. You weren't? Funny, neither was I. However, he told me anyhow. He told me a lot of other things about the car, also. Like, did you know how many inches the pistons are? I do! I also know the correct oil to use for it, how to treat the leather interior, and how to load it onto a flatbed truck in case of a flat tire."
"RORY: Geez, did he talk about anything else but the car?"
"LORELAI: Not until we got to the restaurant . . .and the wine list."
"RORY: Oh no, he's a wine-y?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he sniffed, swirled, swished, and did every other pretentious and borderline-disgusting thing that you can do with a glass of wine in a public place, and he did it all while describing to me the vintage discrepancies and the wood they use for the barrels in Palermo and the grape crop projections for the following year. And I, in turn, chimed in with my story about getting sick on Andre Cold Duck in the back of Peter Cutler's car in ninth grade. He didn't find that quite as charming."
"RORY: I can't believe that. That is one of your best anecdotes."
"LORELAI: I know! So I stopped talking. He continued talking and I just sat there thinking about Peter Cutler. How was Peter Cutler? Where was Peter Cutler? Was there any chance that Peter Cutler would appear and k*ll the man sitting across from me talking about torque?"
"RORY: Was the food good at least?"
"LORELAI: Tiny portions, weird sauces."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: That's okay. You don't know until you try, right? Anyhow, I am going to go to bed now and dream of Peter Cutler. Hopefully, it will be dirty."
"RORY: What about Bowie?"
"LORELAI: Unh uh! I'm not sharing Peter Cutler with Bowie."
"RORY: Are you still going?"
"LORELAI: No. There's no way I could stand this guy for another night. I'll catch Bowie the next time he does a farewell tour."
"RORY: Bummer."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: Night Mom."
"LORELAI: Night babe. Oh, and hey, tomorrow, I'll fill you in on how many hours you have to clock to get your pilot's license."
"RORY: I cannot wait."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai and Michel are at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Well, the quilting convention is sitting down to tea."
"MICHEL: Uh, I'm doing internal cartwheels."
"LORELAI: Any messages?"
"MICHEL: Your mother called. The auction people dropped the lamp that we bought at her place and dropped hers off here and she's desperate to have it for some soiree at her house this evening."
"LORELAI: Oh, swell. Well, I guess I can take it to her when I do my other errands. I can pick up Rory, too. [picks up a bowl] This is cool."
"MICHEL: Yes, it was a personal purchase."
"LORELAI: I want it, what is it?"
"MICHEL: An eighteenth century bleeding bowl."
"LORELAI: A bleeding bowl?"
"MICHEL: When doctors bled patients, the blood had to go somewhere, no?"
"LORELAI: Okay  return lamp, pick up Rory, boil right hand."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings, Emily answers. Lorelai is holding a lamp]"
"LORELAI: Hey Mom, I think this is yours."
"EMILY: Ah! Yes, it is. And I believe this is yours."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"EMILY: That auction house is usually so good with deliveries. I'm surprised at the mix up."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, Gilmore and Gilmore  there's kind of a connection there."
"EMILY: Yes, I suppose there is."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I have to pick up Rory in a little while, so we'll see you Friday."
"EMILY: Would you like to sit down, maybe have some coffee?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't wanna leave her standing there."
"EMILY: Well, Rory doesn't get out for another half an hour. You've got a little time."
"LORELAI: Okay, I guess I can stay a minute."
"EMILY: Wonderful. I'll get you a stopwatch so you can keep exact time."
"LORELAI: Uh, that won't be necessary, Mom."
"[they walk to the living room and sit down]"
"EMILY: So, how is everything?"
"LORELAI: Everything's fine."
"EMILY: And how's everything with Rory?"
"LORELAI: Everything with Rory's fine."
"EMILY: And how's everything at the inn?"
"LORELAI: Everything at the inn is fine."
"EMILY: And how was your date?"
"LORELAI: My what?"
"EMILY: Your date with Peyton."
"LORELAI: Well, my date was, shockingly enough, fine. How did you know about his date?"
"EMILY: His mother told me."
"LORELAI: You know his mother?"
"EMILY: A little."
"LORELAI: Oh good."
"EMILY: So, tell me, what did you do?"
"LORELAI: When?"
"EMILY: On your date."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, we just went to dinner, that's all."
"EMILY: I heard you went driving around afterward."
"LORELAI: Well, sure, uh, you know, we drove in the direction of my house. I guess you could call that driving around."
"EMILY: I heard Peyton had a lovely time."
"LORELAI: Did he? Well, that's nice, I'm glad. I should really get going, Mom."
"EMILY: Oh, you have a little more time. I wanna hear more about your date."
"LORELAI: Well, it was just a date, you know, nothing special. Two people eating and talking  one person talking slightly more than the other."
"EMILY: Had he called you since?"
"LORELAI: No, but "
"EMILY: Oh, well, it was only last night, there's time. I just think this is so exciting."
"LORELAI: You know what, Mom, I wouldn't get too excited if I were you."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Well, because we didn't really hit it off that well."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: No one's fault, he's just not really my type."
"EMILY: What do you mean he's not your type?"
"LORELAI: Well, we just don't have any of the same interests, and we didn't find a whole lot to talk about. You know, basically the date was kind of a dud."
"EMILY: Oh, well, that's too bad."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"EMILY: Well, you'll just have to try a little harder on the next date."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: Aren't you going to a concert together next week?"
"LORELAI: Ah, that Peyton's a real Mama's boy, isn't he?"
"EMILY: Just because he shares his life with his mother doesn't make him a Mama's boy, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna go to the concert with him, Mom."
"EMILY: But I thought you had a plan."
"LORELAI: We did, but that was before we spent any time together and realized we can't spend any time together."
"EMILY: You're not gonna cancel on him."
"LORELAI: Mom, believe me, he won't be surprised. He didn't have that great a time either."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you have to go to the concert. You made a commitment to someone, you have to honor it."
"LORELAI: Mom, this is my business, okay?"
"EMILY: Ugh, this is so like you."
"LORELAI: What is so like me?"
"EMILY: You spend five seconds with a person and if they say one wrong thing, you turn on them and never give them a second chance."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: You are extremely judgmental, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm not extremely judgmental of the pot calling the kettle black. I spent two and a half hours with a man who talked about nothing but himself, his place, his car. . ."
"EMILY: He's proud of his accomplishments. What's wrong with that?"
"LORELAI: He didn't end world hunger, Mom. He simply made the grueling decision to spring for the bigger tires."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, you know what, I have to go."
"EMILY: We're not finished discussing this."
"LORELAI: There's nothing to discuss. Rory's waiting. I'll see you Friday."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, I got you a present."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: In my purse."
"[Rory reaches into Lorelai's purse and pulls out a videotape]"
"RORY: Cardio Salsa."
"LORELAI: Yeah, they play the Miami Sound Machine and you dance around, you get a really great workout."
"RORY: Why would you buy me this?"
"LORELAI: Because I'll feel stupid doing in alone."
"RORY: Too bad."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: No way."
"LORELAI: Salsa with me. Pretend I'm Antonio Banderas."
"RORY: If you were standing in back of Antonio Banderas, I couldn't pretend that you were Antonio Banderas."
"LORELAI: Don't you want your mother to live a long and healthy life?"
"RORY: Not if I have to do Cardio Salsa."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Nice knowing you, senora. Adios."
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: I would salsa for you."
"RORY: Well, luckily, you'll never have to."
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello. . .oh, Dwight, hi, it's nice to hear from you, too. . .yeah, hey, how did you get my cell phone number? . . . oh, yeah, gotta love that Babette, huh? . . . oh, the lawn's fine. . .okay. . .okay. . .sure, Dwight, you have a safe trip. . .yeah, bye. [hangs up] It seems that Dwight has been checking the weather reports and Stars Hollow is going to be extra sunny for the next few days, so he was wondering if instead of watering the lawn twice a day for fifteen minutes, we could water it three times a day for ten minutes."
"RORY: He should really get a dog."
"LORELAI: Only if that dog doesn't mind using the bathroom at the gas station cause that lawn is definitely off limits."
"RORY: True."
"LORELAI: So, I have to get back to the inn. . .could you, um, water for me?"
"RORY: It was your idea to do it."
"LORELAI: I can't, I have a China shipment coming in."
"RORY: Do it tonight."
"LORELAI: Dwight says it needs it now, and if we let that lawn die, he's gonna vibe us for the rest of our lives."
"RORY: Not me, I'm going off to college next year."
"LORELAI: You'll be home for holidays."
"RORY: Maybe not now."
"LORELAI: You would stay away from me on holidays just because of Dwight?"
"RORY: Hey, nobody wants vibing on the holidays."
"LORELAI: Rory, please? I'm gonna be seriously late if I have to go all the way home."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Thank you. You're my favorite daughter."
"RORY: You say that to all your daughters."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do, but I only mean it with you."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Rory leaves; Lorelai's cell phone rings again]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Dwight, please, you are on a business trip  get a hooker. [answers phone] Hello?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, good, I'm glad I got you. I just wanted you to know that I am playing golf with Peyton's father Brennan on Sunday."
"LORELAI: Okay. [pause] Wear sunscreen."
"RICHARD: I will call you afterward and we can evaluate how to proceed from there."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'm not sure how much damage has been done so I need some time with the man to assess whether or not a simple apology will work."
"LORELAI: Apology from who?"
"RICHARD: From you."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RICHARD: For the way you treated Peyton."
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"RICHARD: Of course I'm serious."
"LORELAI: Dad, this is none of your business."
"RICHARD: It certainly is my business."
"[Lorelai walks outside]"
"LORELAI: No, who I date or do not date is absolutely none of your business."
"RICHARD: Peyton's mother is in the DAR with your mother."
"LORELAI: I know that."
"RICHARD: She's also on the Opera Committee with your mother, the hospital board with your mother, the horticultural society with your mother."
"LORELAI: I get it, they hang, what's the point?"
"RICHARD: This woman is a very important person in our social circle. She may have taken what you did the wrong way, which could affect her relationship with your mother."
"LORELAI: Dad, all I did was not go on a second date with her fully grown son. There's no way she's gonna be mad at Mom for that."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, you obviously do not understand the way things work in your mother's world. There is a certain protocol that must be followed, social rules that dictate proper behavior, and these rules must be very strictly adhered to."
"LORELAI: Dad, I'm not going out with Peyton again, period."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, let me tell you a little story. Now, two years ago, Sally Wallington's check for the winter formal bounced."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RICHARD: It took her two weeks to replace the check."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RICHARD: When Sally attended the next DAR meeting, she was served the last cup of tea."
"LORELAI: Soooo?"
"RICHARD: Before this unfortunate incident, Sally Wallington always received the first cup of tea. When she was suddenly demoted, your mother moved up to the prime tea spot, and she's held that spot ever since. Now, she's very proud of that spot, and now she's afraid that this little incident may jeopardize it."
"LORELAI: Dad, I explained this to Mom and I'll explain it to you. I'm not sixteen, I don't live with you anymore, I've been making my own decisions, romantic and otherwise, for a long time now and you can play all the golf you want but the subject better be letting chicks into the Augusta Golf Club because my love life is officially off limits."
"RICHARD: Didn't you hear what I just said?"
"LORELAI: About the tea? Yes, I heard it, and I'm sorry, but it sounds insane."
"RICHARD: Of course it sounds insane! It is insane, that is not the point."
"LORELAI: Okay, then what's the point?"
"RICHARD: The point is your mother is upset, and I don't want her to be upset. Now, you may not understand her world, I may not understand her world, but it is her world, and in her world it is very, very important that she have the first cup of tea. And I don't care about your independence or what you told your mother or anything else you have to say  if my wife wants the first cup of tea, she's going to have the first cup of tea, that's it! Now, I will call you after I play golf. [hangs up]"
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Rory turns on the sprinklers, then walks into the house. The phone rings]"
"DWIGHT: [on answering machine] Hey, it's Dwight, leave a message, I'm listening."
"WOMAN: [on answering machine] Dwight, hi it's Doris. Doris, your wife, remember me? The woman who was asleep in bed when you snuck out the window like a spineless little worm! How dare you sneak out like that, you sniveling little pond scum sample! I should call Erin Brockovich to bring a lawsuit against your parents, you steaming lump of toxic waste! You really thought you could get away from me? From me? I would've found you sooner if I had bothered to look, but now I have, I found you, and all I can say is this  I want my board games back! I want them back and I want them back now! And I will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth until I get them back  especially the Trivial Pursuit!"
"[Rory walks outside and tries to turn the sprinklers off, but instead turns them up higher]"
"RORY: Whoa! Agh! [she tries to turn them off] Whoa, gross! [she gives up and pulls out her text pager] Dean, please have your pager with you, please, come on. Dean, come on! Damn you and your b*mb tendencies! Aw man! [runs away from the house]"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory, soaked from the sprinklers, runs down the street and bumps into Jess]"
"JESS: Whoa, whoa, slow down."
"RORY: Get out of my way."
"JESS: I like the new look. It's very Blue Crush."
"RORY: Hilarious."
"JESS: What's the matter?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"JESS: You're walking pretty fast for nothing."
"RORY: Well, our president said exercise and I am very patriotic."
"JESS: And completely soaked."
"RORY: Where is everyone?"
"JESS: Who are you looking for?"
"RORY: No one."
"JESS: Rory, stop. What's the matter  other than the fact that you're obviously out of towels."
"RORY: This guy moved in across the way from us and we said we'd water his lawn and the grass can only be watered in ten minute increments, otherwise the lawn drowns, and the thing is stuck and it won't turn off and I have to find someone, Luke or Taylor or . . .[Jess starts walking away] Where are you going? Jess!"
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Rory follows Jess up the pathway to the spigot]"
"RORY: You don't have to do this. I didn't ask you to do this. I can just find someone else to do it. [Jess turns off the sprinkler] Aw, you made it look so easy."
"JESS: Yeah, it was loose. You just had to press down and give it a good twist, that's all."
"RORY: Well, thank you."
"JESS: You're welcome. So things are good?"
"RORY: Oh, yeah, really good."
"JESS: School?"
"RORY: Good."
"JESS: Still gonna do the Harvard thing?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Good."
"RORY: Yeah, good. So. . .[pager goes off] My pager."
"JESS: Yeah, I figured."
"[Rory checks the pager, then puts it away]"
"JESS: Who is it?"
"RORY: It's, uh, Dean. I paged him earlier to come over and help me and he just got the message, so he's. . ."
"JESS: Coming over to help."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Okay."
"[Jess turns the sprinkler back on and walks away]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings, Emily answers the door]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"EMILY: Hello Lorelai."
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: Hello Rory. That's a pretty sweater."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[they start walking to the living room]"
"EMILY: I do love you in blue, you should wear blue more often. Buy her more blue, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'll get right on it. So, I brought you something Mom."
"EMILY: Oh really? Soda, Rory?"
"RORY: Yes, please."
"LORELAI: Um, these are some pictures from Sookie's wedding. There's a great one of you and Dad dancing. I put them in an album for you."
"EMILY: Well, that's very nice, thank you."
"LORELAI: You wanna see?"
"EMILY: I'm making drinks right now, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Right, later it is."
"EMILY: [hands Rory a glass] Here you go. [hands Lorelai a glass] Here."
"LORELAI: Oh, guess I'm having wine."
"EMILY: You didn't want wine?"
"LORELAI: Wine's fine."
"EMILY: Give it back, I'll get you something else."
"LORELAI: No, I'm good with wine, Mom."
"EMILY: I can make you a martini, would you like a martini?"
"LORELAI: No, I just  you usually ask me what I want, and tonight you didn't ask me what I wanted so I didn't have a chance to tell you how much I would love some wine."
"EMILY: I bought some cheese to have before dinner."
"RORY: Great, we love cheese."
"LORELAI: It goes great with wine."
"EMILY: I will be right back. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Boy, it's cold in here."
"RORY: It's a lot colder where you're sitting."
"LORELAI: Ugh. She's mad at me."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: Think she's gonna be mad at me all night?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: I guess I should go in there and talk to her."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: You wouldn't wanna go in there and talk to her for me?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Good thing you don't get paid by the word."
"RORY: The sooner you get in there, the sooner you get cheese."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"[Emily is preparing a plate of cheese as Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Need some help?"
"EMILY: No, I'm fine, thank you."
"LORELAI: Mom, I just wanted to say I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Sorry for what?"
"LORELAI: Sorry about the whole Peyton thing. When I asked you for his number, I didn't think. . ."
"EMILY: Think about what?"
"LORELAI: Think about what would happen if things didn't work out with us. I mean, I know his mom is your friend, and I shouldn't have even gotten mixed up in this whole thing if I wasn't prepared to remember that what I do will affect you, and to me it's just a Bowie concert, but to you, it's not. I was a little thoughtless and I'm sorry, but you have to understand that I was not lying when I said we had a bad time. We had a really, really, really, really, really bad time. I swear, it was one of the worst times I've ever had, it was awful. Do you remember skiing with the Danners and their Dobermans?"
"EMILY: Oh, God, yes."
"LORELAI: This was worse. And, by the way, not just for me  it was pretty bad for him, too. It wasn't like he was in love and I was miserable. We were both in pain  deep pain, Marathon Man kind of pain. But despite all of this horrible pain that we were both in, and would be in again if we had to spend one more second together, if you really want me to, I will go to the Bowie concert with him."
"EMILY: Well, your saying that means a lot."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai. Borrow Rory's sweater when you go. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: [sings] Ground control to Major Tom. . ."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[A bunch of catalogs are spread on the kitchen table, and Lorelai is going through them as Rory walks out of her bedroom]"
"RORY: Morning."
"LORELAI: Morning."
"RORY: Wow, someone woke up in project mode today."
"LORELAI: I'm like the army, baby. I get more done before nine o'clock in the morning than others get done all day."
"RORY: Well, as long as you don't abandon it mid-project."
"LORELAI: I do not do that."
"RORY: Make your own seashell candles."
"LORELAI: Aw, not fair."
"RORY: The place smelled like melted crayons for three weeks."
"LORELAI: This is different."
"RORY: Fine, what's the project?"
"LORELAI: This is a pile of every catalog we have received for the last three months."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: I have gathered them all together, and I will now proceed to call all the companies that are sending us duplicates and tell them to stop."
"RORY: That's very environmental of you."
"LORELAI: It's getting ridiculous. We get, like, eight of some of these."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: Check this out. [picks up a stack of catalogs] This is a stack of identical catalogs mailed to Lorelai Gilmore, Rory Gilmore, Lorelai Rory Gilmore, Lorelai V. Gilmore, Lorelai Victoria Gilmore, Lorelai Gilmo, Lorelai Gil, and Squeegy Beckinheim."
"RORY: How'd that get in there?"
"LORELAI: I once told a store my name was Squeegy Beckinheim just to see how many catalogs they would sell my name to, and apparently my name is to catalog companies what Brooke Shields' picture is to Chinese restaurants."
"RORY: How many?"
"LORELAI: Ten."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Including one we were already getting seven catalogs from."
"RORY: So apparently you made the problem worse."
"LORELAI: Unintentionally."
"[Rory reads the label on another catalog]"
"RORY: This one is addressed to Tookie Clothespin."
"LORELAI: Oh, I forgot my code name at the second store I tested, so I told them it was Tookie Clothespin."
"RORY: Which means we get even more catalogs."
"LORELAI: Again, it was unintentional."
"RORY: When you start a forest fire unintentionally, it's still your fault."
"LORELAI: You're putting calling myself Squeegy Beckinheim and Tookie Clothespin on a level with starting a forest fire?"
"RORY: It's k*ll trees."
"LORELAI: You're depressing me now."
"RORY: Well, get on the phone and stop the madness. That'll cheer you up."
"LORELAI: I need coffee."
"RORY: There's more coffee."
"LORELAI: I should get ready, too."
"RORY: You're stopping mid-project."
"LORELAI: I'm bored."
"RORY: Then don't start these projects."
"LORELAI: I promise I'll finish. I just wanna check on the seashells."
"RORY: These catalogs will be sitting here forever."
"LORELAI: No, they won't. They're biodegradable."
"RORY: Come on, I'll call half, you call half, okay?"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: You do yours first, then I'll do mine."
"RORY: Hey!"
"LORELAI: We only have one phone. You're young. You'll dial faster. [leaves room]"
"RORY: Squeegy!"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO"
"[There's a town meeting going on]"
"TAYLOR: The bottom line is that too many birds are landing atop the street lights and relieving themselves on helpless passersby. And I dare say that some of these birds seem to be doing it on purpose."
"BABETTE: You get dumped on, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: It's not just me. . ."
"LUKE: Hey, if anybody has a picture of Taylor getting dumped on, I'll pay top dollar."
"KIRK: I'll check the internet."
"MISS PATTY: Taylor, all animals have to. . .you know. How are you gonna stop birds from doing that?"
"TAYLOR: Easy. Put sharp metal spikes on the top of the fixtures, then when they land, pow  they're shish-kabobs."
"RORY: That's cruel."
"BABETTE: You can't do that."
"ANDREW: I'd rather have bird crap fall on my head."
"LORELAI: There it is  our new town slogan."
"RORY: I like it."
"LORELAI: I see coffee mugs, T-shirts."
"RORY: Don't forget stuffed shish-kabobbed birds."
"LORELAI: That moan when you squeeze them."
"[a man enters through the large sliding door]"
"JESUS: Excuse me."
"TAYLOR: May I help you, sir?"
"JESUS: Yes, I was looking for. . .ah, there she is. . .uh, Patricia."
"LORELAI: Patricia. . .well, well, well."
"EVERYONE: Woooooooo!"
"MISS PATTY: Now stop it."
"JESUS: Are you ready?"
"MISS PATTY: I'm right in the middle of something, Jesus, but I'll be right out. Patience."
"JESUS: Okay. [walks out]"
"TAYLOR: Now, as we were saying. . ."
"BABETTE: Who's the fox, Patty?"
"TAYLOR: Excuse me."
"MISS PATTY: I met him at a funeral. Great guy, good dancer, Latin. . ."
"EVERYONE: Wooooooo!"
"TAYLOR: People, order please."
"LORELAI: He better treat you right, this guy."
"BABETTE: Yeah, how well do you know him?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, I just met him."
"KIRK: I could look him up on the internet."
"TAYLOR: People, please! Now, due to the lack of response, we'll hold off on the bird spikes."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: Let Miss Patty's date begin."
"[Babette hands Patty a camera]"
"BABETTE: It's a digital. I want a full visual account."
"TAYLOR: Hold it. There's one more issue that must be addressed before we can adjourn. All right. Now, that weird, taciturn fellow who's always walking around with his backpack has put in an absurd request to stage a protest in the town square."
"LORELAI: The town loner?"
"LUKE: That guy still lives around here?"
"BABETTE: Somewhere in the hills, right?"
"LUKE: I thought he was long gone."
"ANDREW: No, he came into the bookstore a couple times last month, never said a word."
"MISS PATTY: He's a bit creepy."
"TAYLOR: Very creepy."
"LORELAI: But he's our Boo Radley, and we don't have a Boo Radley, unless you count the troubadour or Pete the pizza guy or the guy who talks to mailboxes."
"RORY: Well, I think the point is that every town needs as many Boo Radleys as they can get."
"LORELAI: Yes, that's my point."
"MISS PATTY: What's he protesting, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Well, that's not indicated here, but it doesn't matter, because protesting is not allowed in the town square, period. It's un-American."
"LUKE: You mean like the Revolutionary w*r?"
"BABETTE: And Rosa Parks?"
"TAYLOR: That's different. They were against the British and buses. No one likes the British or buses."
"[Jesus walks in again]"
"MISS PATTY: Yes, dear, what is it?"
"JESUS: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I heard my name."
"MISS PATTY: No, he said buses, dear, not Jesus."
"JESUS: Sounded like Jesus. [leaves]"
"TAYLOR: Could this meeting be more disrupted?"
"LORELAI: I could do a soft shoe."
"RORY: Yeah, while I pound out a b*at on the bongos."
"BABETTE: Ooh, that sounds like fun!"
"MISS PATTY: I got bongos in the back."
"TAYLOR: Seeing as how our attention spans are gnat-like tonight, as town Selectman I am refusing the town loner's request to protest and I am adjourning this meeting."
"LORELAI: She's all yours, Jesus!"
"LUKE: We got nothing of substance done in this meeting."
"LORELAI: And the tradition stands."
"[People start to leave; Lorelai, Luke, and Rory walk out together]"
"LORELAI: Hey, what do you know about this town loner guy?"
"LUKE: Same as everyone. Just kind of skulks around with that backpack, never smiles."
"LORELAI: Does he also make cheeseburgers and secretly harbor a desire to wear a backwards baseball cap?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: [sings] They're cousins, identical cousins. . ."
"LUKE: Stop it."
"[Jess drives by in a b*at car]"
"LORELAI: Well. . . look who's back behind the wheel. Lovely."
"RORY: Mom, I'm gonna get going. I've got some studying to do."
"LORELAI: Okay, babe. I'll catch up with you."
"[Rory leaves]"
"LORELAI: When did Jess get a car?"
"LUKE: Oh, uh. . .recently."
"LORELAI: Where'd he get it?"
"LUKE: He got it from a guy around here, at a place."
"LORELAI: A guy at a place?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You had no idea he had a car, did you?"
"LUKE: Not in the least."
"LORELAI: Ah, way to have a handle on things, Luke."
"LUKE: Well, he doesn't share a lot with me, you know? And he's got a license. What can I do?"
"LORELAI: Stop him before he k*ll."
"LUKE: He's not gonna k*ll anyone."
"LORELAI: He's got a bad track record with cars."
"LUKE: Yeah, I know, okay? I'm not exactly thrilled with this."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'm sorry. It's your thing. I'll just butt out now."
"LUKE: Where'd he get the money?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: For the car. Where'd he get it?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Working at the diner?"
"LUKE: I can barely afford a car on the money I get working at the diner."
"LORELAI: Maybe it was a gift from someone. . .who doesn't know it's gone yet."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"LORELAI: I'm helpful, aren't I?"
"LUKE: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Lorelai leaves; Luke walks over to Jess]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"LUKE: So. . .you got a car."
"JESS: Motor Trend's not gonna be giving it any awards, but it'll get me from point A to point B."
"LUKE: Yeah, I guess it'll get you around. So, uh. . .where'd you get the money for it?"
"JESS: Mugged an old lady."
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: It didn't cost that much."
"LUKE: What's not much?"
"JESS: Less than a lot?"
"LUKE: Jess, where did you get the money?"
"JESS: You know that hash you sling at the diner? I scrape it off the plates in the back. Remember I work for you?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I know you do."
"JESS: Okay, then."
"LUKE: I also know I don't pay you enough to buy the car."
"JESS: I saved up my pennies and I bought the car from Gypsy. She gave me a good deal. That's how I got the car."
"LUKE: Okay, so you bought a car. Now, the price of the car is just one small thing. It's just the beginning."
"JESS: Oh, yeah?"
"LUKE: Did you take the additional expenses into account?"
"JESS: Like. . ."
"LUKE: Insurance?"
"JESS: I'm in good hands."
"LUKE: Liability, uninsured motorist?"
"JESS: All the paperwork's in the glove compartment. Feel free to check it out."
"LUKE: Money for gas?"
"JESS: You mean this didn't come with a never empty magical t*nk?"
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: I factored that in."
"LUKE: You're gonna have repairs."
"JESS: Yeah, and I can fix most of them myself and save up for the rest. Plus, I'm gonna make sure to replace the oil every couple months."
"LUKE: Right, I bet you didn't think of that, the oil. That costs money."
"JESS: I'm the one that brought it up. You're the one that didn't think of it."
"LUKE: No, but. . .I just. . ."
"JESS: Sign this. [hands him a piece of paper]"
"LUKE: The registration?"
"JESS: I'm still a minor."
"LUKE: I don't have a pen."
"[Jess hands him a pen]"
"LUKE: I guess it's okay that someone else's name is crossed out on it and that yours it written in."
"JESS: Yup."
"LUKE: Just checking. [signs it and hands it back]"
"JESS: Thanks. I'm glad we had this talk."
"LUKE: Yeah, same here."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is studying on the couch as Lorelai walks through the front door with the mail]"
"LORELAI: Hello!"
"RORY: I'm in here!"
"LORELAI: Wow, you b*at me home by two minutes and your nose is already in the books."
"RORY: I can go from zero to studying in less than sixty seconds."
"LORELAI: Very impressive. Mail call. [hands Rory a piece of mail]"
"RORY: What's this?"
"LORELAI: Mortgage payment. You mind picking it up this month sweetie, baby, cookie, honey?"
"RORY: No, not at all."
"LORELAI: It's just something addressed to you."
"[Rory opens it]"
"RORY: It's an invitation."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"RORY: [reads it] Oh."
"LORELAI: An invitation to what? Oh, is it the White House again? Those boys never give up."
"RORY: It's to Sherry's baby shower."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: Sherry. Sherry Tinsdale. Dad's Sherry?"
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"RORY: It's at her and Dad's house on Sunday."
"LORELAI: Wow, that is very weird. We haven't had contact with Christopher in months. She must know we're on the outs with him, right?"
"RORY: Yeah, but she may not know how on the outs."
"LORELAI: Well, zero contact is maximum on the outs."
"RORY: Yeah. . .although there may have been some."
"LORELAI: Some what?"
"RORY: Some contact."
"LORELAI: Oh. . .you've been in contact with Christopher?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: On, no, hon, don't apologize. You've always been totally free to talk to him whenever you want. I've told you that. I mean, he's your dad, right? So don't apologize."
"RORY: Okay, I take the apology back."
"LORELAI: I think it's good you've been talking to him. It is a little weird you didn't tell me, though."
"RORY: Yeah, sorry."
"LORELAI: Will you stop apologizing?"
"RORY: Even when I feel like I should apologize, I can't apologize?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's a little annoying."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I'm just trying to lighten the mood here."
"LORELAI: The mood is light. I just hate that you thought you had to hide something like that from me."
"RORY: I just kind of felt like I was betraying you or something."
"LORELAI: Well, you weren't."
"RORY: I know that now."
"LORELAI: So, how much contact have you had with him?"
"RORY: Not tons. He emailed me a month or so ago, I emailed him back, and now we occasionally talk on the phone."
"LORELAI: Does he ever ask about me?"
"RORY: What answer will freak you out the least?"
"LORELAI: The honest one."
"RORY: Yes, he asks about you because Dad will always care for you very much, you know that. Do you want me to say hello for you next time we talk?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Fine. [holds up invitation] What should I do about this?"
"LORELAI: It's your call."
"RORY: I guess being in Dad's world automatically means being in Sherry's."
"LORELAI: And it is your little half brother or sister she's carrying."
"RORY: I know, it's weird."
"LORELAI: Sort of a good reason to make some connection with her."
"RORY: Yeah, but it's gonna be one of those brunchy quichey things where I don't know anyone, and it's all the way in Boston."
"LORELAI: I'll drive you there if you want."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'll do some Boston shopping while you quiche it."
"RORY: And we can set up some sort of SOS signal that I can page you with if I want to bail early?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"RORY: What should the SOS signal be?"
"LORELAI: How about. . .SOS?"
"RORY: Perfect."
"LORELAI: So you're going."
"RORY: I guess I'm going."
"LORELAI: Good, I think you've made the right decision."
"RORY: So do I. And I shouldn't have hid that I'm talking to Dad. I'm really s"
"LORELAI: Ah!"
"RORY: Starving."
"LORELAI: I'll get some ice cream."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is behind the counter as Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"LUKE: You're up early."
"JESS: I got a few errands to run."
"LUKE: You got time before school?"
"JESS: I got wheels."
"LUKE: Right, right, you got wheels. [Jess takes a donut from the display] Lid."
"JESS: By the way, I owe you ten bucks."
"LUKE: When did I loan you ten bucks?"
"JESS: Last night."
"LUKE: I wasn't here last night."
"JESS: You're always here, Uncle Luke  in my heart."
"LUKE: You took money out of the register"
"JESS: I'm going to the bank now. You'll get it back today."
"LUKE: I told you a hundred times, do not take money out of the register."
"JESS: Gotta run."
"LUKE: Lid."
"[Jess leaves, and Luke watches him out the window. Kirk, sitting at a table, clears his throat]"
"LUKE: Oh, uh, what can I get you, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Patty melt and a coke."
"LUKE: You want the melt cut into squares or stars today?"
"KIRK: Half and half?"
"LUKE: Okay, coming right up."
"KIRK: Thanks. [looks out the window at Jess' car] Man, that car's a honey. Duel piston cams, diplex overdrive with maximum torque, sixteen liter side by side, firing three on one. . . sweet."
"LUKE: Kirk, none of that makes any sense."
"KIRK: What?"
"LUKE: I know a little about cars, that was all gibberish."
"KIRK: Oh, well, would you mind not telling people about this? I've cultivated a reputation as sort of a car aficionado and in reality, all I have is a Jan and Dean record."
"LUKE: I'll keep it to myself."
"KIRK: I should probably listen to it again."
"LUKE: Yeah, I would."
"KIRK: Man, I wish my mom would let me have a car. . .or a bike. . .or my roller skates back."

"CUT TO HEWES BROTHERS' GARAGE"
"[Gypsy is looking under Jackson's truck]"
"GYPSY: You don't take care of it."
"JACKSON: I take great care of it."
"GYPSY: This truck doesn't like you."
"JACKSON: Oh, is it talking to you now?"
"GYPSY: Your transmission's sh*t."
"JACKSON: I shift up and down a lot."
"GYPSY: Mr. Grind-it-til-you-find-it, huh?"
"JACKSON: Just tell me what needs doing."
"GYPSY: Be faster to say what doesn't need doing."
"JACKSON: Whatever you want."
"GYPSY: You ride your breaks. Bad for the truck, good for me. I like replacing brakes. Pays for the cable TV."
"JACKSON: No problem. How bout I just make the check out directly to your cable company, would that be easier for you?"
"GYPSY: Yeah, thanks. And get some extra checks cause you're gonna be making one out to my milkman, too. Oh, and looky here, you just bought me a couch. [Luke walks up to them] Hey Luke."
"LUKE: Hey Gypsy. I don't wanna interrupt."
"JACKSON: No, please, interrupt. I need a little break from the gaiety. [walks away]"
"GYPSY: What can I do for you?"
"LUKE: Uh, well, uh, Jess came home with this car and it says on the slip that he bought it from you."
"GYPSY: Yup, it's working great, if that's what you're wondering."
"LUKE: No, I know that, it's just, uh. . . he paid you for it, right?"
"GYPSY: Nothing's free at Gypsy's."
"LUKE: And he paid cash?"
"GYPSY: Mostly twenties."
"LUKE: Did you make sure Andrew Jackson was on the bills, not Alfred E. Newman or someone?"
"GYPSY: Looked real to me."
"LUKE: Well, when he took the money out of wherever he had it, did a mask or a g*n fall out?"
"GYPSY: No, but he was carrying it in a canvas bag with a big dollar sign on it."
"LUKE: Really?"
"GYPSY: No."
"LUKE: Good."
"GYPSY: Guys are stupid."
"LUKE: What?"
"GYPSY: You strip your gears, you ride your breaks, and if we don't laugh after we make a joke, you think we're serious."
"JACKSON: I don't ride my brakes!"
"LUKE: I just want to make sure it was on the up and up."
"GYPSY: Hey, when people come in with cash, I don't ask where it comes from, do you?"
"LUKE: Nah, I guess I don't. Thanks."
"GYPSY: Anytime."
"[Luke leaves; Gypsy looks under the hood of Jackson's truck]"
"GYPSY: Oh, goody, a trip to Florida!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Taylor, a priest, and a rabbi are sitting at a table in mid-conversation]"
"TAYLOR: This is outrageous. The town unanimously refused to let that loner freak protest in the square. Why would the two of you consider allowing him to do it from the steps of your church?"
"REVEREND: The town didn't refuse him, Taylor  you did."
"TAYLOR: So you're spearheading this revolt, Reverend?"
"RABBI: Reverend Skinner and I share the church for services, Taylor, so if there's gonna be a protest, it'll be a joint decision. Ugh, I can't even look at this mayonnaise."
"REVEREND: I got it, David. [moves the mayonnaise bottle]"
"RABBI: Thanks, Archie."
"TAYLOR: I could still ban it. I could get the town council together, find something on the books. I'm sure there's a way."
"REVEREND: The church is exempt from your town statutes, Taylor."
"RABBI: We answer to a higher authority. . . like the hot dog."
"REVEREND: I laugh every time you say that."
"RABBI: I know. Funny is funny."
"TAYLOR: Well, I can guarantee that God does not want this either."
"REVEREND: Did you hear that, David? Taylor Doose is in direct communication with God."
"RABBI: Thirty years I'm working for God, I haven't received so much as a card."
"REVEREND: Is it by phone that you speak with him, Taylor?"
"RABBI: Do you have a God phone, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Rabbi, please."
"REVEREND: What's he like? For us common folk who've never met him?"
"RABBI: Is he short, is he tall?"
"REVEREND: Does he like to laugh?"
"RABBI: Is the whole shellfish thing really serious? Because, I gotta tell you, some of these Red Lobster commercials. . ."
"REVEREND: They look good, huh?"
"RABBI: Oh, with the melted butter? Oh my God."
"TAYLOR: Can we stay serious for a minute here?"
"REVEREND: You're too uptight, Taylor."
"RABBI: And no matter how much steam blows out of your ears, our decision will be final."
"TAYLOR: So it's hardball, huh? Well, the council gave you special permission to run bingo out of that building. We could withdraw it."
"RABBI: At your peril."
"TAYLOR: Meaning?"
"RABBI: You're gonna tell my little old ladies, my bubbies, you're shutting down their bingo?"
"TAYLOR: I'm not afraid of your bubbies, Rabbi."
"REVEREND: Oh, God, thank you for letting me be in the room when Taylor said that."
"TAYLOR: Well, gentlemen, I would sincerely like to thank you for wasting my time."
"REVEREND: Our pleasure, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I can't believe that you, Reverend Skinner, of all people, would do this to me after all the support I've given you over the years."
"REVEREND: All the support? Taylor, you're a Sunday Protestant. You come in, you say Hi God', you sing a song, and you leave."
"TAYLOR: I always leave a dollar!"
"REVEREND: For your singing voice, you should leave two."
"TAYLOR: Well, fine, if you feel like that, maybe I will just stop showing up altogether. Maybe I'll convert to something else and give them my generous weekly donation."
"REVEREND: Do you want him?"
"RABBI: Not after the whole bubbies thing."
"REVEREND: Maybe the Shakers in Woodbury would take him."
"RABBI: Yeah, he's already got the beard. Can you make furniture, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Goodbye gentlemen."
"[Taylor leaves; Luke enters the diner and walks up to Caesar]"
"LUKE: How's it going?"
"CAESAR: Ah, pretty slow."
"LUKE: Hey, is Jess upstairs?"
"CAESAR: I haven't seen him."
"LUKE: Okay, thanks."
"[Luke goes upstairs and walks into his apartment]"
"LUKE: Jess?"
"[Luke starts going through Jess' dresser drawer. The phone rings, startling him]"
"LUKE: [answers phone] Hello? . . . Oh, hey Randy, what's up?. . . Well, someone's gotta take care of it, you know? It's not going to take care of itself. . . .I understand, I get it. What else?. . . Mmhmm. . ."
"[While on the phone, Luke continues looking through Jess' stuff]"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"RORY: So do you think I got a good gift?"
"LANE: It's foolproof."
"RORY: It's not very original."
"LANE: A new mother can't have too many baby blankets. Not with the insane amount of stuff constantly oozing out of a baby's every orifice."
"RORY: Ew."
"LANE: I just call it like I see it."
"RORY: Well, call it less graphically."
"LANE: The very concept of childbirth is vaguely disturbing."
"RORY: Yeah. Kids are cool and all, but getting there seems like a big cosmic joke."
"LANE: Definitely thought up by a man."
"RORY: My mom said that when she told me where babies come from."
"LANE: My mom still hasn't told me."
"RORY: Really?"
"LANE: When my cousin got pregnant, she said it's because an angel brushed its wings against her face."
"RORY: I could fill you in on the details sometime if you want."
"LANE: No thanks, I've picked it up off the streets."
"[they pass Jess' car]"
"LANE: That's new."
"RORY: Is it?"
"LANE: I've never seen it before, and I'm very into the minutia around here."
"RORY: That's for sure."
"LANE: Do you know whose it is?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LANE: Whose?"
"RORY: Jess'."
"LANE: Jess? Jess, the guy who wrecked your car? He's got a car now?"
"RORY: Mmhmm, looks that way."
"LANE: That's outrageous! That's a travesty!"
"RORY: It's not that big a deal."
"LANE: Oh, it's a humongous deal."
"RORY: You're taking this very hard."
"LANE: Because we're best friends, Rory. We're linked. I feel what you feel. Except for right now because you don't seem to be feeling anything and I'm incensed."
"RORY: It's just a car. It's nothing to get excited about."
"[Jess walks over]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Hey Lane."
"LANE: Hey back at ya, tough guy."
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: Lane. . ."
"JESS: Something wrong?"
"RORY: No. . ."
"LANE: Yes! You have a car."
"JESS: I know."
"LANE: Don't give me lip!"
"JESS: Lip?"
"RORY: Lane. . ."
"LANE: How'd you get the car, Jess?"
"JESS: I bought it."
"LANE: Really, I thought you might've built it from parts left over from cars you've totaled."
"JESS: What is your problem?"
"LANE: Don't play dumb. You know what you did."
"JESS: I gotta go."
"LANE: Yes, drive on away, we'll just keep walking. That's all Rory's been able to do these past few months  lots of walking. She's got bunions because of you, mister!"
"JESS: Bunions?"
"RORY: I don't have bunions."
"LANE: She's too nice to complain about her foot ailments."
"JESS: Knock if off, Lane."
"RORY: Just get in the car and go, Jess."
"JESS: I didn't start this."
"LANE: Well, you started it when you wrecked Rory's car."
"JESS: Tell your friend to walk it off."
"RORY: You walk it off."
"JESS: I'm trying to drive off."
"RORY: Then go."
"JESS: Geez, how Andy Griffith is this town that people get so excited by a car?"
"RORY: It's not the car, it's who's got the car."
"JESS: Okay, fine, you want it? Take it, I'm sick of this."
"RORY: I don't want this piece of junk."
"JESS: Right. I suppose Dean is already building you another car, something really snazzy."
"RORY: Shut up and go."
"JESS: Gladly."
"RORY: Let's go."
"LANE: Gladly."
"RORY: [to Jess] Oh, and by the way, you left your bra in the back seat."
"CUT TO BOSTON"
"[Lorelai and Rory pull up in front of Sherry's house. There are green balloons out front]"
"LORELAI: This must be the place."
"RORY: I think the balloons confirm it."
"LORELAI: No pink, no blue."
"RORY: All green."
"LORELAI: Aren't baby shower balloons supposed to reflect the sex of the baby? Blue for boys, pink for girls."
"RORY: You would think."
"LORELAI: What's green for, aliens?"
"RORY: I'll ask when I go in."
"LORELAI: We're all set, right? Anytime you want out, just send up a flare."
"RORY: I will."
"LORELAI: Even if I'm half-naked in a changing room, I'll just grab everything and rush out."
"RORY: You making a half-naked entrance would be funny."
"[Sherry comes to the car window]"
"SHERRY: Hi!"
"RORY: Whoa!"
"SHERRY: Oh, I'm sorry, I totally snuck up on you."
"RORY: It's okay, hi."
"SHERRY: Hi, Rory. Lorelai, I'm so excited you came."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm just dropping Rory off."
"SHERRY: Oh, don't go. Stay."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SHERRY: Come to the party, please?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know."
"SHERRY: I know that you weren't invited, but it's just cause my friends didn't think that you'd be comfortable. I told them not to worry."
"LORELAI: Thanks, but I'm not really dressed for a party."
"SHERRY: Oh, please. We're not formal here, you look fine."
"LORELAI: Well. . .um. . ."
"RORY: Um, Mom kind of has plans."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I got a couple credit cards burning a hole in my wallet."
"SHERRY: Oh, go shopping some other time and come play with us. Please? There's just a bunch of people in there that Rory doesn't know, and having you here would make her so much more comfortable."
"RORY: Oh, I don't mind not knowing anyone at the party, really."
"SHERRY: That's nice, honey, but very unconvincing. Lorelai, I meant to extend the invitation to both of you. I just wasn't sure if you'd. . . Well, you know, there's lots of food, and booze for the lucky non-pregnant ones, and cake. . .it'll be fun."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"SHERRY: I'll block your car with my stomach."
"LORELAI: No, don't do that."
"SHERRY: Please, it would mean so much."
"LORELAI: Well. . . um, okay, sure."
"SHERRY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, let's have a party."
"SHERRY: Yay! [jumps up and down]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, watch it, you'll jiggle that thing right out of you."
"SHERRY: A mother's perspective, thanks."
"CUT TO SHERRY'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Sherry walk into the house]"
"SHERRY: Come in, come in."
"LORELAI: Nice place."
"RORY: Very nice."
"SHERRY: Well, it's a work-in-progress. It was so bachelor pad before: rock posters, modular furniture, magazines everywhere. I would pick up a TV Guide and it would be three months old. [leads them to the living room] Well, here's the gang."
"[Six women are gathered in the room, and they greet Lorelai and Rory]"
"SHERRY: You've got Gail, Jody, Maureen, Linda, Susan and Alice."

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Signs and banners are displayed in the town square promoting the upcoming 24-hour dance marathon. Lorelai is in Luke's Diner, staring out the window at the people walking by]"
"LUKE: What about that one?"
"LORELAI: Hm, no."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Too pale."
"LUKE: So what?"
"LORELAI: Pale means sickly."
"LUKE: Or sunscreen."
"LORELAI: Or Mad Cow Disease."
"LUKE: Pale does not mean Mad Cow Disease."
"LORELAI: Have you ever had Mad Cow Disease?"
"LUKE: Twice last week and my coloring was wonderful."
"LORELAI: I need a great dance partner this year. Someone strong, non-clutzy, with lots of stamina. Ooh, how tall is that guy?"
"LUKE: Mrs. Coulter's about 6'2""."
"LORELAI: Oh. Four years in a row, I have come this close to winning. Last year, I swear to God, I had it!"
"LUKE: I know the story."
"LORELAI: It was hour twenty-three."
"LUKE: I know the story."
"LORELAI: I'm dancing with Henry Ho-Ho McAphie the third."
"LUKE: How many people heard me say I know the story?"
"[several customers raise their hands]"
"LORELAI: And Ho-Ho's fading, so I'm trying to buck him up, saying ""Come on, Ho-Ho. Stay with me Ho-Ho,"" and then all of a sudden he starts yelling, ""Stop calling me Ho-Ho, it's making me hungry!"""
"LUKE: Oh, hey, look, there goes Tommy Tune."
"LORELAI: And out of nowhere, Kirk comes dancing by, waving a McDonald's hot apple pie in the air and of course Ho-Ho lunges for the pie and drops my hand and that was it. Kirk wins, I'm out. I'm gonna get that Ho-Ho someday."
"LUKE: I'll help ya."
"LORELAI: I wanna win."
"LUKE: I know you do."
"LORELAI: I need a partner."
"LUKE: You'll get one. Keep looking."
"LORELAI: Mm. [she stares up at him]"
"LUKE: Out there. [turns her head toward the window]"
"LORELAI: But, but, wait "
"LUKE: Pancakes, right? Coming right up."
"[walks to another table as Taylor walks in]"
"TAYLOR: Breathe in deep, folks. Smells like fall."
"LUKE: Get out, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Why?"
"LUKE: Just a code I live by."
"TAYLOR: Oh. . .pffft. . .you. Listen, I'd like to run a little something by you."
"LUKE: I'm busy, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I was just thinking how nice it would be if you could set up a little coffee stand at the marathon."
"LUKE: Coffee stand."
"TAYLOR: Yes. I mean, these people have to try and stay up for twenty-four hours. What better to help you stay up than a cup of nice strong cup of coffee, huh? What do you say?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"TAYLOR: Really?"
"LUKE: For a buck a cup."
"TAYLOR: Luke, this marathon is a charitable event."
"LUKE: Taylor, we have been raising money to restore that stupid bridge for eight years."
"TAYLOR: We're not raising money to restore the bridge."
"LUKE: We're not?"
"TAYLOR: No, we have that money. The Tennessee Williams lookalike contest last month put us right over the top."
"LUKE: Then what the hell is this dumb thing for?"
"TAYLOR: A tarp."
"LUKE: A what?"
"TAYLOR: To cover the bridge."
"LUKE: This is a first, Taylor. I actually need to sit down."
"TAYLOR: Well, Luke, you know as well as I do that if we start renovations now, heading right into the snow and rainy part of the season, then everything we do is gonna get ruined, and there we are  back at square one. If we are gonna do this right, then we are going to need a tarp."
"LUKE: Taylor, you are asking me to donate free coffee to hundreds of people so you can raise money to buy a tarp."
"TAYLOR: How bout fifty cents a cup?"
"LUKE: How bout I charge for cream?"
"TAYLOR: You would kick Tiny Tim's crutch out from under him, wouldn't you?"
"LUKE: If he asks for a free cup of coffee, gimpy's going down."
"[Taylor storms out of the diner as Luke walks over to Lorelai's table]"
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa  look at Taylor go. I wonder who he's dancing with."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner]"
"LORELAI: This is amazing chicken, Mom. I mean it, really great."
"EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: It's like super chicken. I bet it could fly. Have you tried tossing it out the window?"
"EMILY: All right, what's going on?"
"LORELAI: What? I like the chicken."
"EMILY: Nobody likes the chicken that much, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm in a good mood."
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: My God, it's my ninth grade homecoming dance all over again."
"RORY: Homecoming dance?"
"LORELAI: In ninth grade, I got asked to the homecoming dance and I didn't think I would, and I was in a really good mood, and Mom got so annoyed that she made me go to my room."
"RORY: Grandma?"
"EMILY: She was sitting at the table giving all the peas voices."
"LORELAI: With a little encouragement, I could've been the Senor Wences of the vegetable set."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay, okay, okay. It'll come out soon enough. Today, ladies and gentlemen, I found a dance partner."
"RORY: You did?"
"LORELAI: A good one."
"EMILY: What are you talking about, a dance partner? A dance partner for what?"
"LORELAI: Our town is having a dance marathon this weekend."
"RORY: It lasts twenty-four hours and the last couple left standing gets a trophy."
"LORELAI: A big trophy."
"EMILY: Well, that sounds very nice."
"RORY: All the proceeds go to charity."
"LORELAI: Which is great  but did I mention the trophy?"
"RORY: I believe you did."
"LORELAI: Cause it's big."
"EMILY: Charitable events are wonderful things to take part in. There's nothing more rewarding than devoting yourself to making someone else's life better."
"LORELAI: And whose life isn't better with a truly gigantic trophy around?"
"RORY: So who'd you get to dance with you?"
"LORELAI: Stanley Appleman."
"RORY: Who's Stanley Appleman?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he's brand new in town. He works over at the hardware store, and the best part is, he used to be part of the touring company. . .of Riverdance."
"RORY: Score!"
"LORELAI: I know! I'm completely jazzed. How bout you, Mr. Potato? I'm completely jazzed, too."
"[a phone rings]"
"EMILY: What's that?"
"LORELAI: I think that's me."
"EMILY: Lorelai, I've told you a hundred times to turn that thing off when you come to dinner here."
"LORELAI: I know, Mom. I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Can't you let it go to voice mail?"
"LORELAI: Well, see, I left Michel alone at the inn, and he's dealing with the roofers. I told him to call me if there was any trouble. [goes to answer the phone]"
"EMILY: Is that true?"
"RORY: I'm gonna let Mr. Potato field this one."
"EMILY: I thought so."
"[Lorelai answers the phone in the next room]"
"LORELAI: Hello? . . . What? . . . Oh, no no, no no, don't tell me that. . .Well, did you tell her how big the trophy is, because I am really not exaggerating here. . . How did your wife get a picture of me? Stanley, that is crazy! I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Did you tell her I don't wanna sleep with you? . . . Well, put her on the phone. I'll tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Well, somebody has to tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Why are you insulted all of a sudden? . . . Stanley? . . ."
"[Lorelai hangs up and walks back to the dining room]"
"LORELAI: Great."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LORELAI: Stanley bailed."
"RORY: No! Why?"
"LORELAI: Apparently, Miss Patty showed his wife a picture of me, and she thinks I look like Elizabeth Taylor, which makes her Debbie Reynolds, and Stanley Eddie Fisher."
"RORY: That's crazy."
"LORELAI: Especially if you've seen Stanley. He's no Eddie Fisher, trust me. Fisher Stevens, maybe."
"RORY: Can't you talk to her?"
"LORELAI: Apparently, only at my own risk."
"EMILY: Well, at least she thought you looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That was nice."
"LORELAI: I have no partner."
"RORY: You'll find another one."
"EMILY: Elizabeth Taylor always did."
"RORY: There's someone else out there, trust me."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"EMILY: Here. Have some more chicken."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Mom."
"EMILY: And if you'd like, later on, you can make my asparagus talk."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe next week."
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory and Paris are standing at Paris' locker. Louise and Madeline are behind them, each kissing a guy]"
"PARIS: Okay, so, let's talk about Saturday."
"RORY: What about Saturday?"
"PARIS: I think we need to work. The seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin comes out next month and I want it to be amazing."
"RORY: I've got some great cover art lined up."
"PARIS: Old pictures, new pictures?"
"RORY: Collage style with kind of a sepia-toned finish to it. Very classy."
"PARIS: Okay, I like it. Time!"
"[Louise and Madeline stop kissing the guys and say goodbye to them]"
"LOUISE: See ya."
"MADELINE: Bye."
"[the four girls start walking down the hall]"
"MADELINE: So, what were we talking about?"
"PARIS: Working Saturday on the seventy-fifth anniversary issue."
"LOUISE: Thanks for asking."
"MADELINE: But you guys already have some decent stuff planned out, right?"
"PARIS: Madeline -- or may I call you Spicoli?"
"MADELINE: If you have to."
"PARIS: This is the seventy-fifth anniversary issue. There is only going to be one seventy-fifth anniversary issue ever, and it's on our watch. We screw this up and we basically mooned a piece of history. Is that what you want? To B.A. history?"
"MADELINE: But I don't understand. Last year was the seventy-fourth anniversary issue of the Franklin."
"PARIS: So?"
"MADELINE: So there's only gonna be one seventy-fourth anniversary issue ever and we didn't do anything special for it."
"LOUISE: I think the cover was of a deep-fried Mars bar."
"PARIS: That's because nobody cares about the seventy-fourth anniversary issue."
"MADELINE: I bet the person who worked on it seventy-four years ago did."
"PARIS: We're working Saturday!"
"[Paris and Rory walk outside]"
"PARIS: ""Why are we working Saturday, Paris? What's so special about the seventy-fifth issue, Paris? Why does my head feel so light and yet not float away, Paris?"""
"[Paris sees Jamie across the courtyard]"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: What's he doing here?"
"RORY: I bet he's here to see you."
"PARIS: He hasn't called me once. I haven't seen or heard from him since we had our date in Washington three months ago."
"RORY: Maybe he wants to explain why."
"PARIS: He was supposed to go away and never come back. I already wrote his name in my revenge notebook."
"RORY: Paris, he knows you're standing here talking about him."
"PARIS: What does he want?"
"RORY: Go over there and find out."
"[Paris walks over to Jamie]"
"PARIS: What do you want?"
"JAMIE: I'm on break from school, I thought I'd come down and see you."
"PARIS: But you never called."
"JAMIE: I know."
"PARIS: You lost my number?"
"JAMIE: Nope, I memorized your number."
"PARIS: You didn't wanna use my number?"
"JAMIE: I was starting classes."
"PARIS: In phone dialing? How's it going?"
"JAMIE: Look, Paris, this year's very important for me. I thought the last thing I needed was a distraction."
"PARIS: Well, I totally understand. This year's very important for me, too. I'm focusing on getting into Harvard, and the last thing that I need is a distraction. . . so, good move. You saved us both a lot of distractions. Thank you, and good luck. [they shake hands, but Jamie doesn't let go] I need my hand."
"JAMIE: If I let go, how fast will you run away?"
"PARIS: 3.2 seconds."
"JAMIE: I thought so. Hey Rory."
"RORY: Hey Jamie. How's Princeton?"
"JAMIE: It's good. Crazy, but "
"PARIS: Let go."
"JAMIE: No."
"PARIS: Yes."
"JAMIE: Paris."
"PARIS: Look, you don't have to be nice, you don't have to tie up loose ends. I get it, I'm a distraction. Now either pull a Boxing Helena, or give me back my hand."
"JAMIE: Yes, talking to you would've been a distraction."
"PARIS: I know. I heard you already. My God, find a pirate to sit on, okay?"
"JAMIE: However, not talking to you has turned out to be impossible."
"PARIS: What?"
"JAMIE: I flunked a pop quiz in poli-sci because I couldn't stop thinking about you. Still want your hand back?"
"PARIS: I've got another."
"JAMIE: I've thought a lot about this, and apparently you're a distraction that I'm supposed to have."
"PARIS: You didn't have a bad time on the date?"
"JAMIE: Are you busy right now?"
"PARIS: Well "
"RORY: No, we're done. She's free."
"JAMIE: Good. Let's go get some coffee. Bye Rory."
"RORY: Bye Jamie."
"[Jamie takes Paris' books from her and walks away]"
"PARIS: He took my books."
"RORY: Well, go get them back."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory, Dean, and Lane are in the living room. Lane is on the phone]"
"RORY: Well?"
"LANE: Still ringing. [a moment later, she hangs up] He's home."
"RORY: How'd he sound?"
"LANE: Homey."
"RORY: Nice."
"DEAN: I know this is a stupid question, but why can't you just talk to him?"
"LANE: Because yesterday he called to say that they were still looking for a rehearsal space and, uh, that he'd call when he had more news. So now I have to wait until he calls about the band  and in between, I call and hang up on him. Pathetic."
"RORY: Not so pathetic. I used to hang up on Dean all the time."
"DEAN: You did?"
"LANE: I remember that."
"DEAN: When did you hang up on me?"
"RORY: Right when we first met."
"DEAN: You should've just said something."
"RORY: I couldn't do that."
"DEAN: Why not?"
"RORY: Because then you would've known that I was calling and therefore that I liked you."
"DEAN: Yes, but I liked you, too."
"RORY: Well, I know that now."
"DEAN: You could've known that then."
"RORY: Dean, please. This is a girl thing."
"DEAN: Uh, okay. Tell me when I'm supposed to pay attention again."
"LANE: I'm gonna love him forever and he's never gonna know it."
"DEAN: He would if you coughed."
"RORY: Dean."
"DEAN: Sorry."
"LANE: At least he's at home and not out with a girl."
"RORY: Very true."
"DEAN: He could be home with a girl."
"RORY: Dean."
"DEAN: Sitting here, staring at my pizza."
"LANE: You think he was at home with a girl?"
"RORY: No, no, I don't."
"LANE: I'm gonna call again."
"RORY: Good idea, and pay attention to the background noise this time."
"[Lorelai walks through the front door]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, cool, pizza."
"RORY: Shh. She's calling Dave to see if she can hear a girl in the background."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"DEAN: I voted that she actually say something."
"LORELAI: You're a boy, you know nothing about this."
"RORY: Well, what'd you hear?"
"LANE: Quadrophenia."
"RORY: Classy, but not date-like."
"LANE: You think?"
"RORY: Definitely."
"DEAN: What if he met a girl who's a major Who fan?"
"LANE: What?"
"RORY: Why are you causing trouble?"
"LORELAI: Rory, can I talk to you in the kitchen?"
"RORY: Oh, sure. [to Dean] Be good."
"[Rory and Lorelai leave the room; Lane sits next to Dean on the couch]"
"DEAN: Go ahead."
"[Lane starts dialing the number again]"
"[cut to Lorelai and Rory in the kitchen]"
"RORY: Okay, so, what's on your mind?"
"LORELAI: I think I figured out who can be my dance partner for the marathon."
"RORY: Great! Who?"
"[Lorelai stares at Rory]"
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Come on!"
"RORY: Forget it."
"LORELAI: Just hear me out. First of all, you love me."
"RORY: Not right at this moment, I don't."
"LORELAI: You know how much this contest means to me. You'd never fall asleep or chase a pie."
"RORY: I do not dance."
"LORELAI: It'll be fun. We'll get all dressed up, and you're light  easy to hold up when you get tired."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Plus, we got the whole mother/daughter gimmick going for us. The crowd'll eat that up."
"RORY: I cannot dance with you."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"RORY: Because this is Dean's first marathon. We were gonna go and watch and hang out, he's totally looking forward to it. I told him about how Andrew gets in a fight with his date in the first fifteen minutes and storms off the floor. I told him about Taylor getting punch-drunk at hour fifteen and telling stories about how he always wanted to be a magician."
"LORELAI: Rory, please."
"RORY: And ooh, I told him about how when Kirk wins, he likes to take his victory lap around the floor to the theme from Rocky. I was gonna show him all those things, and I was gonna show them to him sitting down."
"LORELAI: He can still come, and he can still see all those things, except if you dance, maybe that victory lap will be you and me instead of Kirk."
"RORY: Okay, I'll tell you what. I was supposed to work on the Franklin this weekend with Paris."
"LORELAI: But?"
"RORY: I will ask her if we can reschedule. If she says yes, then I will dance with you."
"LORELAI: Oh, I love ya!"
"RORY: You should sell cars."
"LORELAI: I should, shouldn't I? Hello, big fancy trophy."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"[A teacher is addressing the class as Paris walks in late]"
"TEACHER: Take note of its form before treated. Make sure that your notes are completely legible since you will be turning them in with your result. Miss Gellar, hello."
"PARIS: Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Savitt."
"TEACHER: Is everything okay?"
"PARIS: Yes. I overslept."
"TEACHER: You're kidding."
"PARIS: No, it won't happen again."
"TEACHER: Well, good. Okay, everyone, let's get to work."
"[Rory walks up to Paris]"
"RORY: Paris, hi. Listen, I need to ask you something."
"PARIS: sh**t."
"RORY: Well, there's this big event that's happening in my town. . ."
"PARIS: Pig race?"
"RORY: Dance marathon."
"PARIS: I was close."
"RORY: It's on Saturday, and it's a twenty-four hour thing and my mother really wants to win, and her partner bailed on her and, long story short, I was wondering if there was anyway we could move this Saturday's Franklin thing to next Saturday."
"PARIS: Okay."
"MADELINE: What did she say?"
"LOUISE: I don't know. What did you say?"
"PARIS: I said yes."
"LOUISE: She said yes."
"MADELINE: She said yes."
"LOUISE: [walks up to a guy] Are you free on Saturday?"
"GUY: Uh, no."
"LOUISE: [to another guy] What about you? Come on  speak."
"MADELINE: [from across the room] Louise, I got two over here!"
"PARIS: So, we're done, right?"
"RORY: You had a good time yesterday."
"PARIS: What was yesterday?"
"RORY: Yesterday was the day that you were all freaked out about the seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin and today's the day you're not."
"PARIS: Rory, just because I agreed to postpone a newspaper session does in no way imply "
"RORY: You can't even stop smiling."
"PARIS: I can, too."
"RORY: Tell me."
"PARIS: Okay. Well, we went for coffee, and he talked about how he had a great time on our date, and how he finds me fascinating, and how he thought about me all the time. Okay, there, happy?"
"RORY: Wow, he likes you."
"PARIS: I left an impression."
"RORY: You sure did."
"PARIS: I still don't understand why he'd wanna date me. He's surrounded by college girls all day long who must be prettier than I am, and more experienced than I am. I mean, I'm sure they're all idiots, but usually that's the last thing a guy thinks about when he's looking for a date for the big game."
"RORY: Well, Jamie must be special."
"PARIS: Or Ted Bundy."
"RORY: Absolutely. It's either one or the other."
"PARIS: Hey. Can you do me a favor?"
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: Don't say anything to Madeline or Louise about this."
"RORY: About Jamie?"
"PARIS: Yeah."
"RORY: But they're your best friends."
"PARIS: Theoretically, yes, but the second I mention a guy they're gonna both start singing the theme from the Trojan Man commercial, and I just can't take that, okay?"
"RORY: No one knows until you give the word."
"PARIS: Thanks."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE STARS HOLLOW"
"[The morning of the dance marathon, Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk toward the high school]"
"LORELAI: I have to say, for a couple of modern girls, we have time-warped with the best of them."
"RORY: Mm."
"LORELAI: How ya doing there, champ?"
"RORY: Early."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's a tad early."
"RORY: No sun."
"LORELAI: Well, he's not up yet."
"RORY: I can't even open my eyes."
"LORELAI: That's okay, there's nothing to see. Kirk's in a Speedo, Taylor's in a skirt, Al's in assless chaps."
"RORY: Oh my God, stop. I'm never gonna be able to close my eyes again."
"[Babette is sitting at the sign-up table in front of Stars Hollow High]"
"LORELAI: Morning Babette."
"BABETTE: Oh, morning sugar. You guys look terrific."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"RORY: Babette, can I lay down on the table while Mom signs in?"
"BABETTE: Not an early bird, huh?"
"LORELAI: I need to get some coffee in her and we'll be fine. Kirk, however, is gonna be crying like a little teeny girl."
"BABETTE: So what else is new? Okay, now you two go get your physicals, bring your release forms inside, and they'll get you a number."
"LORELAI: Thanks. Come on, Snoozy."
"[they start walking down the sidewalk toward Miss Patty's, and Sookie runs up behind them]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, wait up!"
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, look at you!"
"SOOKIE: Is it fabulous?"
"LORELAI: It is fabulous."
"SOOKIE: Wait til you see Jackson's suit. It makes me want to ration sugar."
"LORELAI: Where is Jackson?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, we already had our checkups, so he's going to sign us in and scope out a good spot on the floor."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's so cool to be married. You have your own spot-scoper."
"RORY: I'm gonna go say hi to Lane."
"LORELAI: Okay, hon, hurry back. Remember, the sooner we get inspected, the sooner we get coffee."
"RORY: Yeah, coffee. [walks into Miss Patty's]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, I have a problem."
"LORELAI: Sookie, it's five-thirty in the morning. How can you already have a problem?"
"SOOKIE: Because I'm a multi-tasker."
"LORELAI: Hit me."
"SOOKIE: Last night, I made coq au vin for dinner, so of course the subject of children came up."
"LORELAI: Of course."
"SOOKIE: All of a sudden, completely out of the blue, Jackson announces he wants four in four."
"LORELAI: He wants what?"
"SOOKIE: Four in four. Four kids in four years."
"LORELAI: Good Lord!"
"SOOKIE: I know!"
"LORELAI: Well, who's he gonna have these kids with?"
"SOOKIE: Me, apparently."
"LORELAI: What did you say?"
"SOOKIE: See, here's where, uh, the problem comes in."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I think I said yes."
"LORELAI: How is that possible?"
"SOOKIE: Well, I was totally shocked when he announced it and I sort of said, ""O. . kay"" and . . but I think he took it as, ""Okay!"" So, apparently, now I have to get busy."
"LORELAI: Do you want four in four?"
"SOOKIE: No. But, I mean, I want kids. You know I want kids."
"LORELAI: I know you want kids."
"SOOKIE: But I thought maybe one. Two if the first one is really quiet."
"LORELAI: Well, honey, you have to tell Jackson that."
"SOOKIE: I can't."
"LORELAI: Sookie, this is not like the fruit bowl his mother gave you. You can't stick four kids in the attic and just pull them out at Christmas."
"SOOKIE: I know, but Jackson and I have never had a real fight. We're still newlyweds. We still sneak out of bed in the morning to brush our teeth, then get back in bed and pretend we just woke up smelling like that."
"LORELAI: You don't have much of a marriage if you can't talk about the important things."
"SOOKIE: I know. Do you think I'm crazy to not want four in four?"
"LORELAI: Four kids is a lot, and four years without a cocktail . . ."
"SOOKIE: Wow, hadn't thought of that."
"LORELAI: Glad to shed some much-needed perspective on the situation."
"SOOKIE: We'll take care of this today."
"CUT TO INSIDE MISS PATTY'S"
"[Rory is standing next to Lane, who is stirring a big bucket of something]"
"RORY: Are you sure you don't need some help?"
"LANE: Yeah, it's okay. I finally got a really good footing."
"RORY: What is that stuff?"
"LANE: Eggless egg salad. Though this year my mom added food coloring to make the egg-like product look more eggy."
"RORY: Smart."
"LANE: And every sandwich comes with your own personal pamphlet ""Dancing for the Devil,"" an illustrated look at the effect of dancing on your chances of spending all eternity in hell."
"RORY: Boy, her flames are getting really good."
"LANE: Well, she just bought a new color printer. You can do a ton of stuff with it."
"RORY: Cool."
"[Mrs. Kim walks over carrying several bags]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane, get scooping! The minute air hits the bread, it starts to stale."
"LANE: Okay, Mama."
"RORY: I'm gonna stop by later and say hi."
"LANE: Please do."
"RORY: Bye, Mrs. Kim."
"MRS. KIM: You have a pamphlet?"
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"MRS. KIM: Take one to your mother."
"[Across the studio, Lorelai is next in line for physicals as Rory walks over]"
"NURSE: Next."
"LORELAI: Oh, good, just in time."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Hi there. Um, this is Rory Gilmore and I'm Lorelai Gilmore."
"NURSE: Lorelai Gilmore?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, L  o  r . . ."
"NURSE: You don't look like you've recently suffered a face-altering car crash."
"LORELAI: Uh, excuse me?"
"NURSE: You're also supposed to have buck teeth, a club foot, and alopecia."
"LORELAI: Oh. I'm sorry, who told you this?"
"NURSE: My husband."
"LORELAI: Your husband? Well, who's . . .Stanley Appleman. Your husband is Stanley Appleman."
"NURSE: Mmhmm."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, it's very nice to meet you. Stanley's said the nicest things about you. In the one tiny short conversation we had, you know, standing way far apart. You know, too far to touch, but close enough to hear all the wonderful things he said about his adorable, sweet-tempered, lovable. . . can we have someone else do our physical?"
"CUT TO INSIDE THE STARS HOLLOW HIGH GYMNASIUM"
"[Dancers start to gather on the dance floor as Taylor makes some announcements over a microphone]"
"TAYLOR: Any couple without a number will be disqualified. All couples must be touching at all times. All couples must remain moving at all times. The only time you may stop moving or stop touching is when you hear this horn. [blows air horn] That sound means you have ten minutes. Ten minutes to get a drink, to eat a snack, take a rest, or whatever it is you can do in ten minutes. And in addition to the ten-minute rest periods, every person participating has been issued a yellow emergency card. In case of emergency, a contestant may hold up the card and leave the floor for ten minutes. If your partner remains on the floor and moving the entire time, then the owner of the yellow card may rejoin them and the contest. First aid is available in Miss Patty's. Please, remember, that if you feel yourself getting lightheaded or having sh**ting pains or any other stroke-like symptoms, please move off to the side so that your collapse will not get in the way of the other dancers. All right, people, lace your shoes, pin those curls, because we only have three minutes left until we start."
"LORELAI: Well, I believe three minutes is plenty of time for some coffee."
"RORY: Yes, coffee, please."
"[they walk over to Luke's coffee table on the side of the dance floor]"
"LORELAI: Hey, we're dying, load us up."
"LUKE: It isn't ready yet."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Mommy."
"LORELAI: What do you mean it's not ready? It's six in the morning. Nothing says coffee like six in the morning."
"[Luke picks up a thermos and hands it to them]"
"LUKE: You did not get this from me."
"LORELAI: Then who do we send our kisses of gratitude to?"
"LUKE: The eternal question asked yet again."
"RORY: Thanks Luke. Strong."
"LORELAI: Yeah? Hello."
"TAYLOR: All right, folks. Everybody on the floor. We're two minutes away. I repeat, everybody on the floor, we are two minutes away."
"[On the dance floor, Kirk and his partner walk up to Lorelai and Rory]"
"KIRK: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: Good luck to you."
"LORELAI: And to you."
"[Kirk and his partner walk away]"
"LORELAI: He's going down."
"RORY: I hate to bring this up."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Kirk has very little in his life."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: He has no career, no girlfriend, no pet, no car. He lives with his mother, she won't even let him have his own key. The only thing he does have in his whole lonely pathetic existence is this marathon. If we win, if we take him down, if we take away that last little piece of dignity, then we leave him with nothing."
"LORELAI: I wonder if he'll cry."
"RORY: My mother, the Howard Roark of Stars Hollow."
"TAYLOR: All right, everybody, grab your partners, make sure your numbers are securely fastened, and let the countdown begin!"
"EVERYONE: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!"
"TAYLOR: It's showtime!"
"[All the couples start dancing]"
"[Babette taps Morey on the shoulder]"
"BABETTE: I'm done, let's go."
"MOREY: Okay."

"CUT TO LATER IN THE MARATHON"
"[Six hours have passed. Kirk and his partner dance by Lorelai and Rory]"
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk, relax. Dancing's supposed to be fun."
"KIRK: You know what will be fun, Lorelai? Jogging around your prostrate body with that shiny temple of silver importance hoisted in the air for all to see. That will be fun. [dances away]"
"LORELAI: Do you think serious Kirk is more disturbing than non-serious Kirk?"
"RORY: Actually, I think they're both about the same."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Follow me."
"[they dance over to Dean]"
"DEAN: Wow, you guys look great."
"RORY: Hey, you came."
"DEAN: Hey, you're standing."
"LORELAI: Hey, we had coffee."
"DEAN: I can tell. So, how's it going?"
"RORY: Oh, it's been pretty quiet so far. However, I do believe "
"ANDREW: [in background] You went out with Liam Neeson! Are you kidding me?"
"LORELAI: Right on time!"
"ANDREW: Why would you ever tell me that you went out with Liam Neeson? Why would you do that?"
"WOMAN: Because I was trying to be honest."
"ANDREW: I don't believe that A, you actually went out with Liam Neeson, and B, that you would choose to tell me now at this moment that you went out with Liam Neeson!"
"WOMAN: Andrew!"
"ANDREW: No!"
"WOMAN: Andrew!"
"ANDREW: I can't stand Liam Neeson! [storms off]"
"RORY: See, fun!"
"LORELAI: And no one's even thrown up yet."
"DEAN: Okay, well, uh, I'm just gonna go sit over there and watch for awhile. Maybe I'll get lucky."
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: Well, that's sweet. Spectator Ken."
"RORY: Just keep dancing, you."
"[Kirk dances by and flips his partner]"
"LORELAI: Flip all you want, pal. This ain't the Olympics. It's who's left standing at the end that matters, not how fancy you are getting there."
"[Kirk and his partner dance away]"
"LORELAI: Let me flip you."
"RORY: No way."
"LORELAI: Come on!"
"RORY: You are not flipping me."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: You flip me."
"RORY: No need, you've already flipped."
"LORELAI: One cartwheel."
"RORY: Silence."
"[Jess and Shane walk across the dance floor to the bleachers]"
"TAYLOR: Unauthorized persons on the dance floor. Unauthorized persons on the dance floor. Security! Security! Security!"
"LORELAI: Well, look who's suddenly interested in dance."
"RORY: Yeah, he's a regular Martha Graham."
"[Rory watches Jess and Shane kiss]"
"CUT TO LATER IN THE MARATHON"
"[Fourteen hours have passed. Everyone is tired and dancing very slowly. Rory is trying to sleep on Lorelai's shoulder. Lorelai sees Kirk dancing toward them.]"
"LORELAI: [to Rory] Kirk."
"RORY: Mm?"
"[they start dancing more lively until Kirk passes by]"
"RORY: How much longer?"
"LORELAI: Oh, chin up soldier. We should be getting a break pretty soon."
"RORY: I hope so."
"[Jackson and Sookie dance over to them]"
"JACKSON: Oh good, there she is."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, please."
"LORELAI: Hey guys."
"JACKSON: Well, hey to you, too. Listen, I wanted to ask you, what do you think of my hair?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"JACKSON: My hair. How's it look to you? Any opinion?"
"LORELAI: It looks fine."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, you're overacting."
"JACKSON: You think? How bout you, Lorelai? You think I'm overreacting?"
"LORELAI: Jackson, what?"
"[a horn sounds]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"RORY: What, what?"
"LORELAI: The runaround."
"RORY: The runaround? That does not sound good."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, baby. I'm so, so sorry."
"TAYLOR: Ladies and Gentlemen, on your marks. . .get set. . .and go!"
"[all the dancers start running in a circle around the gym]"
"TAYLOR: Round and round they go, but when the song stops, nobody knows! But the last five couples that finish behind the red line are automatically out, so hold onto your partner and move, move, move!"
"MISS PATTY: You're getting too much pleasure out of this, Taylor."
"[Jackson and Sookie are running behind Lorelai and Rory]"
"JACKSON: Hey Lorelai, just wondering, how's my running? Got an opinion on that?"
"LORELAI: Jackson, what's going on?"
"SOOKIE: Nothing. He's mad at me and he's taking it out on you."
"JACKSON: Oh, I'm not mad. I just didn't realize that when I married Sookie, I also married you. I didn't realize I was a Mormon, my mistake."
"RORY: I need to interject for one second to tell you that I hate you!"
"LORELAI: Thanks, honey."
"SOOKIE: Quit trying to drag Lorelai into this."
"JACKSON: Fine, I will. [walks off the dance floor]"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, wait! Yellow cards, right here! I've got them for the both of us. We'll be right back! [follows after him]"
"TAYLOR: One of you is supposed to stay here. Hey!"
"RORY: I think I'm going to die."
"LORELAI: Me first."
"RORY: How much longer?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I just know that every year I block this part out."
"RORY: From now on I'm going to remind you of it."
"[Lorelai notices Kirk running right on their heels]"
"LORELAI: Kirk, what are you doing?"
"KIRK: I'm drafting you."
"LORELAI: Well, stop it!"
"KIRK: You can't tell me where to run!"
"LORELAI: Kirk, I swear to God, don't make me come back there!"
"[a horn sounds]"
"TAYLOR: Ten minute break everyone, ten minute break. Well run. Ten minute break, everyone. Ten minute break."
"[Several people, including Lorelai and Rory, collapse on the gym floor; Rory starts moving her leg around]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"RORY: I'm trying to kick you but I can't reach."
"LORELAI: I would help you but I can't move."
"RORY: Can I owe you one?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, no problem. Okay, okay, heart returning to normal. I have to go find Jackson and Sookie."
"RORY: I'll get us a couple of sandwiches."
"LORELAI: Good idea. [they stand up] This is fun, huh?"
"RORY: Uh huh, big fun."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S"
"[Jess walks up to Lane's table]"
"JESS: So, not dancing?"
"LANE: Nope."
"JESS: Why not? Too cool?"
"LANE: Go away, Jess. No one asked for a Tony Manero wannabe to drop by."
"JESS: Hey, I'm just here for the food."
"LANE: [hands him a sandwich] Here, enjoy, buh-bye."
"JESS: I noticed Rory's not dancing with Dean."
"LANE: Nothing gets past you, does it."
"JESS: How come? Trouble in paradise?"
"LANE: Rory's dancing with her mother. Nothing's wrong with her and Dean, and you're blocking my sandwiches from the rest of the room."
"JESS: I know. They're erecting a statue to me in the park next week."
"MRS. KIM: Who are you?"
"JESS: Jess. . . ma'am."
"MRS. KIM: [to Lane] Scoop more."
"[Mrs. Kim walks away. Rory and Dean walk up to the table]"
"RORY: The sandwiches are for the dancers."
"JESS: I'm dancing on the inside."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"JESS: I live here."
"RORY: You have nothing better to do than to sit around inside a gymnasium all day staring at a dance marathon?"
"JESS: I don't know. [to Dean] Do you have nothing better to do than sit inside a gymnasium all day staring at a dance marathon?"
"DEAN: I wouldn't direct any sort of comment toward me if I were you."
"JESS: I'm just trying to support my town."
"RORY: Good, then go back to New York."
"JESS: Ooh. Zing. I've been snapped."
"RORY: You think you're bugging me sitting in front of me staring like that?"
"JESS: You think you're bugging me dancing in front of me staring like that?"
"RORY: I'm not staring at you."
"JESS: Then how do you know I'm staring at you?"
"RORY: I am dancing. I cannot control where my glance goes. And the few moments that I can control it, my glance goes to Dean, not to you."
"JESS: So you can't control when you look at me, but you have to force yourself to look at him? Sorry, man. That's cold."
"DEAN: My former comment still stands."
"RORY: Go home."
"JESS: No, thanks."
"RORY: Then get out of my way."
"JESS: Didn't realize I was in your way. There you go. It's all yours. God help you."
"[Shane walks over to them]"
"SHANE: Where did you go? I've been sitting out there for twenty minutes."
"JESS: The break's only for ten."
"SHANE: It's just a saying."
"JESS: I came to get food."
"SHANE: Good, I'm starved."
"RORY: The food is for the dancers."
"SHANE: Who are you, Bobby Brady? Get a life."
"JESS: Rory's feeling a little territorial today."
"SHANE: Whatever. God, what is this thing?"
"DEAN: Rory, get your stuff and let's go."
"JESS: Ooh, that was good. Now say then get in there and make me my supper.'"
"RORY: I got them."
"DEAN: Come on."
"JESS: See you in there. [they leave] I'm gonna get a soda."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE GYMNASIUM"
"[Lorelai walks up to Luke's coffee table]"
"LORELAI: Have you seen Sookie and Jackson?"
"LUKE: Nope."
"LORELAI: I've looked everywhere for them."
"LUKE: Have you tried the insane asylum where everybody in this room is supposed to be?"
"[Jackson and Sookie walk up to them]"
"JACKSON: Okay, I need to say something here."
"LORELAI: Oh, I've been looking all over for you."
"SOOKIE: I wish you would just drop this."
"JACKSON: Contrary to your belief, there are some things in life that you do not have the right to have an opinion on."
"LORELAI: What?"
"JACKSON: And the rate at which I have kids and the amount of kids I wish to have falls directly under that category"
"LORELAI: Sookie, what did you tell him?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, you see, once again, my communication k*ll  not so good."
"LORELAI: Jackson, I didn't mean to get involved in any of this."
"JACKSON: No? Telling Sookie that she needs to immediately inform me that four in four is crazy?"
"LORELAI: Aw, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, it did come out something like that."
"LORELAI: Aw man."
"LUKE: What's four in four?"
"LORELAI: Four kids in four years."
"LUKE: That is crazy."
"JACKSON: Oh good, yes, let's open this up to even more discussion."
"LUKE: One kid in four years is crazy."
"JACKSON: Hey."
"LUKE: Sorry, go ahead, drop another sucker in this mess."
"LORELAI: Okay, raise your hand if you're not helping."
"JACKSON: Does anyone here understand that a man has a right not to have his personal life debated in a public forum? I am not Winona Ryder."
"SOOKIE: Well, I know that."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, Jackson, I didn't mean "
"JACKSON: My child-bearing arrangements are between me and Sookie."
"LUKE: And the Lord. Still not helping?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, just please calm down."
"JACKSON: I will calm down. I'll calm down at home."
"SOOKIE: But what about the contest?"
"JACKSON: To hell with the contest! I'm quitting the contest. That is, if it's okay with Lorelai, or Luke, or that strange man in the corner who I've never met. Excuse me, strange man in the corner? Is it okay if I quit this contest? [storms off]"
"SOOKIE: I'm so sorry. I got tongue-tied and things just started coming out and I couldn't stop them and. . ."
"LORELAI: Go."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, honey, wait! [runs after him]"
"LUKE: Oh, they're gonna make great parents."
"TAYLOR: All dancers back on the dance floor. All dancers back on the dance floor."
"[Rory walks up to Lorelai and hands her a sandwich]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"CUT TO LATER IN THE MARATHON"
"[Twenty-three hours have passed. Taylor is drunk at the podium, babbling to Miss Patty]"
"TAYLOR: And then I'd say what is this in your ear' and I'd pull out a bright shiny penny and then whole room would laugh and clap."
"MISS PATTY: Yeah, I'm sure they did, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Yeah. Have you ever levitated a rottweiler?"
"MISS PATTY: No."
"TAYLOR: Not easy. But in a cape with a wand and a shiny black top hat. . ."
"[Taylor falls asleep. Patty tries to take his megaphone, but he wakes up]"
"TAYLOR: What are you doing?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, I was just. . ."
"TAYLOR: You tried to take my megaphone."
"MISS PATTY: No, I just didn't want you to drop it."
"TAYLOR: No one touches my megaphone. No one."
"MISS PATTY: What do you mean "
"TAYLOR: Guards!"
"MISS PATTY: - no one touches your megaphone?"
"TAYLOR: Guards!"
"MISS PATTY: [pokes the megaphone] How's that. . .take that!"
"TAYLOR: Hey! Hey!"
"[cut to Lorelai and Rory on the dance floor]"
"LORELAI: Tell me a joke."
"RORY: Knock knock."
"LORELAI: [giggles] That was a good one. Ow!"
"RORY: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh no!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: My heel broke."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: My heel just broke off. Damn, these are brand new shoes, too."
"RORY: They were made in 1943."
"LORELAI: Well, I just bought them Tuesday."
"RORY: I told you not to wear vintage shoes."
"LORELAI: But the lady at the store said that they hadn't been worn a lot."
"RORY: Yeah, but not a lot in sixty years is still a lot."
"LORELAI: I gotta fix them. I'll use my emergency card. I'll be right back."
"RORY: No, stop. If you leave, there's no way I'll be able to stand up on my own."
"LORELAI: Ten minutes."
"RORY: Nighty-night."
"LORELAI: Fine, hold on. Dean, come here! Dean!"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"[Dean walks over to them]"
"DEAN: Is everything okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's great. Stand here."
"[Lorelai drapes Rory's arm across Dean]"
"DEAN: Whoa."
"LORELAI: Look, I'll be back in ten minutes. Do not let her stop or lay down, do you understand me?"
"DEAN: But I "
"LORELAI: I need you, Dean. The team needs you."
"DEAN: What team?"
"LORELAI: Pick a team  it needs you. I'll be right back."
"[Lorelai walks away]"
"RORY: I'm really sorry about this."
"DEAN: Yeah, uh, it's okay."
"RORY: Are you sure?"
"DEAN: Yeah. Actually, it's not bad at all."
"[cut to Luke's coffee table]"
"LUKE: [to woman on the bleachers] I think that one's a goner, Miss."
"[Lorelai walks up to him holding the heel of her shoe]"
"LORELAI: Hey, my shoe broke."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: I need you to fix it."
"LUKE: Do I look like a cobbler to you?"
"LORELAI: If I say yes, will you fix my shoe?"
"LUKE: Let me see it."
"LORELAI: I only have ten minutes  please."
"LUKE: I think I have some glue back at the diner."
"LORELAI: Glue, yes  we love glue!"
"LUKE: I wouldn't say that too loudly if I were you."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Luke leaves, Sookie walks up to Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: Hey. Are you guys out?"
"LORELAI: No, my shoe broke. Luke's fixing it."
"SOOKIE: Oh, good. Listen, I just feel terrible about what happened."
"LORELAI: I know. How's Jackson?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, he's fine. We went home, and he calmed down, and we talked. He totally understands and he's open to anything I want."
"LORELAI: That's great."
"SOOKIE: Now, tell me what I want."
"LORELAI: No way."
"SOOKIE: But I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: Then flip a coin cause I am staying so far out of this."
"SOOKIE: You're my best friend."
"LORELAI: Yes, I am, and I can only remain your best friend as long as Jackson doesn't k*ll me."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai. . ."
"LORELAI: Sookie, he's a produce man. They'll never find the body, but the squash will be especially chatty that year."
"SOOKIE: Okay, fair enough."
"LORELAI: Hey, take your time. That's it. That's all I have to say."
"SOOKIE: Thank you."
"[Luke returns with the glue]"
"LUKE: Got it."
"LORELAI: Ah, good."
"SOOKIE: Well, I'm going home to figure out what I want. Good luck. Call me tomorrow."
"LORELAI: I will."
"[Sookie leaves]"
"LUKE: So, how's that situation going?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it'll be okay."
"LUKE: Good. Uh, listen, uh, I didn't really mean all that stuff I said earlier."
"LORELAI: What stuff?"
"LUKE: Uh, the kid stuff, you know."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's no big deal."
"LUKE: Yeah, I know, I just. . .I'm not really as anti-kid as I might have come off."
"LORELAI: Drop another sucker in. . ."
"LUKE: Okay, yes. I don't always have the patience for them. They tend to be a little squishy, and that freaks me out a little."
"LORELAI: You don't have to want kids, Luke. Or like kids. It's not for everybody."
"LUKE: I know, but. . .although I'm quite happy going an entire day without having to deal with somebody else's bodily functions, if I ever happen to meet the right person. . .well, it would be a discussion."
"LORELAI: A discussion."
"LUKE: Yes. Probably a short discussion, but still. Here, hold this. So what about you  you ever think about having another kid?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know how much fun it would be without biology finals and headgear. . . but sure, if I ever happen to meet the right person, another kid might be nice."
"[they stare at each other for a moment]"
"LUKE: Your shoe'll be ready in a minute"
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S"
"[Lane is sitting out front. She gets up and walks back inside to the food table, and Dave walks up to her]"
"DAVE: One sandwich please."
"LANE: Hi."
"DAVE: Hi."
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"DAVE: Uh, well, you mentioned this thing last time we talked and it sounded very Blue Velvet so I figured I would come by and check it out."
"LANE: What do you think?"
"DAVE: Uh, I think you held back."
"LANE: Yeah, well. . ."
"DAVE: Anyhow, I hadn't seen you in awhile, and I thought I'd come down and maybe we could figure something out on this band issue."
"LANE: Sure, we could do that."
"DAVE: Plus, I missed you."
"LANE: You did? You missed me?"
"DAVE: Well, yeah. Did you miss me?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah, definitely. I definitely, definitely missed you."
"DAVE: Glad and relieved to hear it."
"[Mrs. Kim walks over to them]"
"MRS. KIM: Who are you, what do you want?"
"LANE: Mama."
"MRS. KIM: Do you know this boy?"
"LANE: Well "
"DAVE: Uh, no, actually, I just heard a bunch of people talking outside about the sandwiches and I thought that I would come in and maybe try one. I'm sorry, may I? [Mrs. Kim hands him a sandwich] Thank you. [takes a bite] That's delicious."
"LANE: Really?"
"DAVE: May I have another one for later please?"
"MRS. KIM: Yes, that's fine. Take another one."
"DAVE: Thank you. You know, my parents would love these sandwiches. I wish I could bring them by but unfortunately they're in private bible study right now."
"MRS. KIM: Bible study?"
"DAVE: Say, how long are you serving?"
"MRS. KIM: Why?"
"DAVE: Well, I thought that if they got out in time I could bring them on over."
"MRS. KIM: Well, the bread is only good for another twenty minutes, after that there's no point. You chip a tooth."
"DAVE: Okay. So if I can get my parents back here in twenty minutes, then you'll still be serving, but in thirty you're done?"
"MRS. KIM: That's right."
"DAVE: Great. So if for some reason I'm not back here in twenty minutes, that means that I'm gonna be over there, on the church steps, waiting for my parents to get out so that I can tell them about the great sandwiches that they missed. Okay? Okay, great. Thanks a lot and I hope to see you soon. [leaves]"
"MRS. KIM: I hope he comes back. He seemed hungry."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE GYM"
"[Rory and Dean are still dancing. Jess and Shane sitting on the bleachers]"
"RORY: He's still there."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: Jess. He's still there. I can't believe he's still there."
"DEAN: Just ignore him."
"RORY: Yeah. You know, this is a dance marathon. You're not supposed to come and sit and watch, you're supposed to dance. He's just trying to bug me, sitting there right in front of me, staring. Jerk."
"SHANE: I'm bored."
"JESS: Okay."
"[they start kissing]"
"RORY: There they go again! God, I swear, why can't they just get a room? Or forget a room  get a park bench, or a doorway, or even a strategically placed telephone pole would probably suffice. I mean, girls like Shane  what is it with them? Don't they see what they look like? I know they have mirrors."
"JESS: Hey, you talking about me?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: I heard you mention Shane."
"RORY: Shane isn't you."
"JESS: Shane concerns me."
"RORY: Shane concerns me, too  and all women, for that matter."
"JESS: You got a problem here?"
"RORY: Nope. Just a little sick of seeing the two of you sitting there. If you're not gonna participate, then why don't you just leave?"
"SHANE: That works for me. Let's go."
"JESS: No."
"RORY: Why not?"
"JESS: Because I'm not ready to go."
"RORY: Oh really?"
"JESS: Yes, really. I'm gonna sit here as long as I like, and I'm gonna do whatever I like, and if you don't like it, then just ignore me and pay attention to your boyfriend."
"DEAN: Sorry, she can't. I'm not her boyfriend anymore."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: You know, I tried to ignore this. I really did, but I don't know what the hell I was thinking."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"DEAN: You don't wanna be with me, Rory."
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"DEAN: Oh, please! You've been into him since he got to town, and I have spent weeks  months, actually  trying to convince myself that it wasn't true, that everything was fine between us. But now I know that I was an idiot. You're into him and he's into you, and Shane, who by the way, should be listening to this cause it's so damn obvious."
"RORY: What's obvious? What did I do?"
"DEAN: Everyone can see, Rory! Everyone. And I'm tired, but I'm over it, so go ahead, go. Be together. There's nothing standing in your way now, cause I'm out."
"[Dean grabs his jacket from the bleachers and leaves]"
"TAYLOR: I don't see a yellow card. I don't see a yellow card. Excuse me, young lady. . .whose name I don't remember right now. . . ugh, no one listens to me."
"MISS PATTY: I know, honey."
"CUT TO THE BRIDGE"
"[Rory is sitting on the bridge as Jess walks up to her]"
"JESS: Dean's a jerk. Yelling at you like that, breaking up in front of everybody. . .the guy's a total jerk."
"RORY: No, he's not. He's right. Everything he said. All those things about you and me, all those things about me lying to him, and messing with his head. He was right. Well, wasn't he? Fine, he was right about me, then. Now go away."
"JESS: He was right. . . about all of it."
"RORY: So, what now?"
"JESS: You're definitely broken up with Dean?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm definitely broken up with Dean."
"JESS: Okay. I have to go take care of something then."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE GYMNASIUM"
"[Only two couples are left: Kirk and his partner, and another couple. The woman of the other couple falls to the ground]"
"KIRK: They're out! They're out! We won! We won! [runs over to Miss Patty and wakes her up]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, oh, oh. Taylor, wake up! It's over. Taylor, blow the horn."
"TAYLOR: [asleep on some chairs] . . .a quarter right out of your ear."
"MISS PATTY: Taylor, the horn. Oh, for Pete's Sake. [Patty blows the air horn] Okay, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner!"
"[Lorelai rushes over to them]"
"LORELAI: Wait, what are you doing? I'm here, I'm standing, I used my yellow card!"
"KIRK: I win, I win! I win, I win, I win, I win!"
"LORELAI: You didn't win! I'm still here! Patty, where's Rory?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, she ran off the floor a little while ago, honey."
"LORELAI: What? No!"
"KIRK: Yes!"
"MISS PATTY: For the fifth year in a row, ladies and gentlemen, the marathon winner is Donna Delain and Kirk!"
"[Lorelai sees Rory across the gym, and she walks over to her]"
"LORELAI: Rory, what happened? Where did you go? [sees that Rory is crying] Oh, Rory, honey! Oh."
"[Lorelai and Rory hug while Kirk runs around the gym with the trophy]"

"LORELAI: Mmkay, still walking, all's good. Huh. Mmkay."
"RORY: How are you?"
"LORELAI: I should probably keep moving."
"RORY: God, my feet have never been in this much pain before."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, what about that time?"

"RORY: Ugh. What were you saying?"
"LORELAI: About what?"
"RORY: About my feet."
"LORELAI: What about your feet?"
"RORY: I don't know. You were talking about the thing you did to my feet."
"LORELAI: What thing?"
"RORY: The thing that you. . .you and. . .huh?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Just an observation  you and I do not function well on a funky sleeping pattern."
"RORY: I feel jet-lagged."
"LORELAI: You've been up twenty-four hours straight."
"RORY: Yes, why did I do that?"
"LORELAI: Because I asked you to."
"RORY: And that worked?"
"LORELAI: At the time. I don't expect it to again."
"RORY: A realist, I like that."
"LORELAI: How far is Luke's?"
"RORY: It's right over there."
"LORELAI: It looks far."
"RORY: Very far."
"LORELAI: Maybe if we concentrate really hard, our combined psychic powers will move it closer."
"[they stare at the diner]"
"RORY: I don't think it's working."
"LORELAI: It's my fault, I'm not focusing."
"RORY: Yes, that must be why we can't move a half a city block closer to us."
"LORELAI: All right then, let's go. On the count of three."
"[Neither of them move]"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. Thank you."
"RORY: I never realized Luke's was a hundred miles away."
"LORELAI: We're lucky it wasn't snowing. It would've been The Donner Party all over again, but with slightly better hair. Why are you sitting over there?"
"RORY: Where?"
"LORELAI: At that table."
"RORY: Huh. How did I get here?"
"LORELAI: You sat there."
"RORY: Well, this chair's very close to that chair, so you understand how I could've made the mistake."
"LORELAI: Move over here with me."
"RORY: Why don't you move over here with me?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm not the one who sat in the wrong chair."
"RORY: I think it's a little presumptuous to assume that my chair is the wrong chair when my chair could just as easily be the right chair."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm the leader of the clan, the provider of the household, the alpha male, and the one whose feet just fell asleep so there's absolutely no chance of movement."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Thank you. See, it's nice sitting at the grown-up table, isn't it?"
"RORY: Uh huh."
"[Kirk enters the diner carrying his dance marathon trophy]"
"KIRK: Oh, excuse me, did my trophy bump you?"
"LORELAI: No, Kirk, it didn't."
"KIRK: Good, because the size of it is so large that sometimes I can't judge where the exact end of it is."
"LORELAI: We're fine, Kirk."
"KIRK: I'm glad, because these shiny golden edges are actually very sharp. They could take an eye out or cause a deep gash completely unintentionally."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"KIRK: It's almost more a w*apon than a trophy."
"LORELAI: Really? Can I hold it, then?"
"LUKE: Get out of the way, Kirk. You're blocking the door."
"KIRK: Luke, I'll be needing one of your larger tables this morning, since your smaller tables simply cannot accommodate the sheer size of my massive trophy."
"LUKE: Put it on the floor."
"KIRK: It needs its own chair."
"LUKE: It's gonna need some glue if you don't sit down pretty soon."
"KIRK: Everybody hates a winner."
"LORELAI: Hey, how bout one person gets pancakes and one person gets eggs and then we can share?"
"RORY: I can't, I have to go."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? It's "
"[Rory shows Lorelai her watch]"
"LORELAI: [gasps] It took us thirty minutes to get here?"
"RORY: Lots of limping."
"LORELAI: Wow, sh**t. Well, at least grab a donut before you go. Hey, unh, Luke, uh, we need a couple of donuts, and, uh, some of those extra legs Heather Mills is sending over to Croatia."
"LUKE: Coming right up."
"[Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"JESS: Hi."
"LUKE: Hi."
"RORY: I have to get to school."
"JESS: Yeah, me too."
"RORY: Bye"
"JESS: Bye. Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"LUKE: Bye."
"[Rory leaves. Jess goes back upstairs]"
"LUKE: What the hell was that?"
"LORELAI: That was episode one of Rory and Jess: The Early Years."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Rory and Jess are together."
"LUKE: Are you serious? What about Dean?"
"LORELAI: Dean and Rory broke up at the dance."
"LUKE: They did? I was at the dance, how come I didn't know about this?"
"LORELAI: Because you're you."
"LUKE: But why, what happened?"
"LORELAI: Jess happened."
"LUKE: Wow, wow. So. . ."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"LUKE: Wow. Well, this is great."
"LORELAI: I'll tell Dean you said that."
"LUKE: You know what I mean, Rory and Jess, Jess and Rory. I think this is great. Don't you think this is great?"
"LORELAI: I think Rory's seventeen and it's probably about time for a Jess."
"LUKE: Look, I know Jess is a little tough sometimes, but he likes Rory and Rory's a good kid, hopefully she'll rub off on him."
"LORELAI: You know what, I've spent a lot of time and energy fighting the whole Jess thing. Rory's made her choice, I want her to be happy. I'm just hoping for the best at this point."
"LUKE: Very romantic."
"LORELAI: Says the man who yelled ""Finally!"" at the end of Love Story."
"LUKE: I'll get you coffee."
"LORELAI: Thank you very much."
"CUT TO THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Richard are sitting at the table. Emily is standing at the doorway to the kitchen]"
"EMILY: Do it again, please! [walks to her seat at the table] I'm not quite sure what other way there is to say no walnuts in the salad' except to say no walnuts in the salad.'"
"LORELAI: Mom, she just made a mistake."
"EMILY: She doesn't listen, she doesn't care, she has no work ethic."
"LORELAI: She has some work ethic. You made her remake the salad four times."
"EMILY: I like things done correctly."
"RICHARD: Preferably the first time."
"EMILY: Thank you, Richard."
"LORELAI: You know, Mom, in Europe, they eat the salad last and the main course first."
"EMILY: We're not in Europe."
"LORELAI: We could pretend."
"EMILY: Really, Lorelai, you can't wait ten minutes for another salad? The situation's that dire?"
"LORELAI: Four salads ago, no, not dire. Right now it's your money for nothing and your chicks for free.'"
"EMILY: Rory?"
"RORY: She didn't have lunch."
"EMILY: Fine."
"RICHARD: Where are you going?"
"EMILY: Apparently, we're going to be European tonight."
"RICHARD: Oh, wonderful. I was getting so tired of being American day after day after day."
"LORELAI: God, I'm starved."
"RORY: Think about something else."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"RORY: Something disgusting that will take your appetite away."
"LORELAI: Ari Fleischer?"
"RICHARD: Ari Fleischer is our nation's mouthpiece, young lady."
"LORELAI: Officially not hungry now."
"EMILY: Liliana will be right out with the sand dabs. I'm afraid we're going to have to let her go, Richard."
"RICHARD: Oh, if that's how you feel, Emily."
"LORELAI: You're firing someone over putting walnuts in a salad?"
"EMILY: I'm going to fire someone over putting walnuts in the salad after she was told not to put walnuts in the salad."
"LORELAI: Mom, you know, if you're not a little nicer to your help, you might find yourself in a Frank Lloyd Wright situation."
"RICHARD: Frank Lloyd Wright?"
"EMILY: What on earth does Frank Lloyd Wright have to do with my salad?"
"RICHARD: And your walnuts."
"LORELAI: Mrs. Wright apparently had this major problem with her help. She was very rough on them and they totally hated her. So this guy who had worked for her forever, he had finally had enough. I believe the incident was over walnuts, wasn't it, honey?"
"RORY: The exact cause has not been proven."
"LORELAI: Anyhow, Mrs. Wright invites this whole posse of people over for dinner and they're all sitting around eating, and Mr. Disgruntled Servant Guy goes outside and locks all the doors and windows and douses the whole house in gasoline and sets the place on fire."
"EMILY: My goodness."
"LORELAI: So the house is on fire, and people are freaking out, so they run to the doors but the doors are locked, so a few of them try to get out through the windows, but Mr. Angry-Puss is standing outside with an ax hacking them to death and so they all died."
"EMILY: Why on earth would you tell me that story?"
"LORELAI: All I'm saying is sometimes eating a walnut is preferable to getting hacked to death or set on fire during dinner."
"EMILY: One of these days I'm going to make you eat in your room."
"RORY: I'm going to go get myself another soda. Would anyone else like something?"
"LORELAI: I'd like a big bag of walnuts, and make sure you tell her they're for me."
"RICHARD: I believe I need a little more ice. Emily, are you fine?"
"EMILY: Yes, Richard, I'm fine, thank you."
"[Lorelai sniffs the air]"
"EMILY: Oh, stop that!"
"CUT TO THE KITCHEN"
"[Rory pulls a soda out of the fridge as Richard walks in]"
"RICHARD: Did you find it?"
"RORY: Yes, I did."
"RICHARD: Good, good. Ah, here we are, ice. And. . .chocolates."
"RORY: Bless you."
"RICHARD: So, tell me, how's it going at school?"
"RORY: It's good. It's crazy."
"RICHARD: Senior year."
"RORY: Yup."
"RICHARD: Preparing for college can be a daunting task. I remember when I was preparing for Yale."
"RORY: Bad?"
"RICHARD: I don't believe I slept the entire year. I didn't even cut my hair for two months."
"RORY: Grandpa!"
"RICHARD: Oh, yes, it was quite a scandal. But in the end, it was all worth it."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"RICHARD: My years at Yale were absolutely the most gratifying ones of my life. Just the sheer freedom of knowing that anything I wanted to learn, I could learn right there. Plus, the history of the place, the heritage. . .my father went to Yale."
"RORY: I know."
"RICHARD: I also made wonderful friends there. Friends I still have today."
"RORY: That must be nice."
"RICHARD: I'm going to be going back there next week. There's going to be a little reunion of the Whiffenpoofs."
"RORY: I'm sorry, the what?"
"RICHARD: It's an a cappella singing group I belonged to at Yale."
"RORY: A singing group?"
"RICHARD: A very famous singing group, actually. Like the b*at, but with better table manners."
"RORY: I've never heard you sing."
"RICHARD: Well, I'm no Perry Como, but my shower hasn't kicked me out yet. Anyway, a group of us are going to get together at the old alma mater and have a little dinner, swap some w*r stories."
"RORY: Sounds fun."
"[the maid walks by with a tray]"
"MAID: Excuse me."
"RORY: Uh, did you see what I just saw?"
"RICHARD: Walnuts."
"RORY: Poor Grandma."
"RICHARD: Poor us. You know, you might wanna come with me next week."
"RORY: Come with you where?"
"RICHARD: To Yale."
"RORY: What?"
"RICHARD: Oh, I don't mean to the dinner, that would be boring for you, but you might enjoy seeing the school."
"RORY: Well "
"RICHARD: Your mother could come to. It would be a fun little adventure."
"RORY: Wow."
"RICHARD: We could drive down, have a little roadside snack, get there about noon. Have a little tour, and then the two of you girls could go off and have fun, and the old folks can have a somber little dinner. I think you'd love to see it. I certainly would love to show it to you."
"RORY: Well. . .sure, Grandpa. That would be nice."
"RICHARD: Wonderful. Oh, I'm thrilled. Uh, do you wanna tell your mother or shall I?"
"RORY: Oh, you know what, I can tell her."
"RICHARD: All right, you tell her. [the maid rushes past them again] Looks like we're gonna need a few more of these."
"RORY: Yeah."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the house]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I officially vote that we send my mother an anonymous note requesting that she never make us the sand dabs again."
"RORY: I'm not sure how anonymous it would be considering she said we were the first people she ever made them for."
"[they get into the car and Lorelai starts the engine]"
"RORY: I have to tell you something."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Grandpa talked to me tonight."
"[Lorelai turns off the engine]"
"RORY: Why'd you turn the car off?"
"LORELAI: I'm just getting the sense that I shouldn't be driving a large vehicle when you tell me this."
"RORY: It's no big deal."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: It's not."
"LORELAI: Then tell me."
"RORY: Okay. Um, well, Grandpa was mentioning that he and Grandma are going on a trip next week, a driving trip somewhere, and he invited me to go. And you. He invited you and me to go on a trip with him and Grandma."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Where's the driving trip to?"
"RORY: Yale."
"[Lorelai gets out of the car and walks toward the porch. Rory follows her]"
"RORY: Mom? Mom, wait."
"LORELAI: No, it's okay, I got it."
"RORY: He's going for some nostalgia thing. For a reunion of, I don't know, the Whiffenhoofs."
"LORELAI: Poofs."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Whiffenpoofs."
"RORY: Not much better."
"LORELAI: I totally agree."
"RORY: Well, he got all sentimental and he really just wants to show me the campus. It's no big deal."
"LORELAI: It's a huge deal."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: There's a reason he wants to drag you out there, Rory. He's manipulating you. Trust me, I know, he's a master at it."
"RORY: Okay, fine, maybe he is, but he really wants me to go, I can tell. And you don't have to go. I mean, he invited you and I would really love it if you could come, but really, you can stay home. Just please don't make a big thing out of this. This doesn't have to be a fight."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: We go. We look. Hi Yale. Bye Yale. It's over. No harm, no foul."
"LORELAI: How many more two-word sentences can you come up with?"
"RORY: You know, it doesn't have to be a total loss."
"LORELAI: Look, as she's leading me back to the car."
"RORY: I'm sure you and I can figure out a fun thing to do while they're off at dinner, some cool road trip thing."
"LORELAI: In New Haven?"
"RORY: Well, yeah."
"LORELAI: Sweetie, have you ever been to New Haven?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Take a look at the coffee pot tomorrow before I clean it, that's New Haven."
"RORY: We can make it fun. It would mean a lot to the grandparents, everybody wins."
"LORELAI: Rory, listen to me."
"RORY: I know, I am being manipulated. This is part of Grandpa's evil plan to take over my life, abolish my free will, pull me in into the Gilmore world, dress me in pearls, and ruin my life. Did I leave anything out?"
"LORELAI: Mm, let me see. . . manipulate, evil plan, no free will, pearls  no, I think you about covered it. Oh, wait  did you call my father the Puppet Master?"
"RORY: No, I did not."
"LORELAI: Always call him the Puppet Master."
"RORY: I will never make that mistake again."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is cleaning off a table as Kirk walks in]"
"KIRK: Luke, where's your lost and found?"
"LUKE: Out back in the dumpster."
"KIRK: I need your help. I don't know what to do. I'm shaking like a spastic colon."
"LUKE: What's the matter, Kirk?"
"KIRK: My trophy's gone."
"LUKE: What?"
"KIRK: Someone took her."
"LUKE: Kirk."
"KIRK: The last time I remember seeing her, she was next to me at the movies."
"LUKE: Stop calling it she."
"KIRK: I retraced my steps all day and nothing. I suspect foul play."
"LUKE: Foul play?"
"KIRK: Kidnapping, possibly."
"LUKE: Well, then, I think you should go to the police, and if they mention something about staying somewhere for observation, it's just routine."
"[Kirk starts to leave as Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hey Kirk."
"KIRK: Rory. [looks into her backpack]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"KIRK: Where were you this morning at about ten?"
"RORY: At school."
"KIRK: Do you have any witnesses?"
"RORY: Yes."
"KIRK: Can you get them to make a short statement?"
"RORY: No."
"KIRK: Oh, well, okay. [leaves]"
"RORY: Someone took his statue again."
"LUKE: Yeah, yeah."
"RORY: Every year."
"LUKE: Well, there's some things in life that never let you down. So. . ."
"RORY: So. . ."
"LUKE: It's nice to see you, Rory."
"RORY: It's nice to see you, too, Luke."
"LUKE: So, table for one?"
"RORY: Um, I'll just sit at the counter."
"LUKE: Okay. What can I get you?"
"RORY: Um, I guess I'll have a cheeseburger."
"[Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"LUKE: Hey Jess, look who's here  Rory."
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Hi."
"LUKE: Okay, time to add another word. Jess, you want something to eat?"
"JESS: I'm not hungry."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry either."
"LUKE: What about the burger?"
"RORY: Oh, well. . .could you wrap it up? I'm gonna eat it later. I actually prefer burgers after they've been sitting around for awhile. Let's them age."
"LUKE: Okay."
"JESS: You know, I've got that book upstairs."
"RORY: Oh, the book we talked about?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: Great."
"JESS: We could go upstairs and look at it."
"RORY: Look at the book, sure. Let's go upstairs and look at the book."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory and Jess walk in]"
"JESS: So, here we are."
"RORY: Yup, here we are. Wow, I haven't seen it since you guys redid it."
"JESS: Oh yeah."
"RORY: It's bigger."
"JESS: Ripping a wall down can have that effect on a room"
"RORY: Yeah. That part, over there."
"JESS: That's mine."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Yeah. You want a soda?"
"RORY: No, I'm fine."
"JESS: Okay. You sure you don't want a soda?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm sure."
"JESS: Please let me get you a soda. I gotta do something other than stand here like a moron."
"RORY: Take comfort in the fact that you are not doing it alone."
"JESS: Okay, let's just regroup here."
"RORY: Yeah, regroup."
"JESS: First of all, we should try to get within, say, a foot of each other."
"RORY: Okay. I think that's about a foot."
"JESS: Huh, that school of yours is really paying off."
"RORY: So, now what?"
"JESS: Now we should. . ."
"RORY: Well, I think we either need to get a little closer or need to warm up."
"JESS: Okay. Hi."
"RORY: Hi."
"[they start to kiss when Luke bursts into the room]"
"LUKE: I got the burger."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LUKE: I also threw in some fries."
"RORY: Fries, great. I love fries. Okay, um, Jess, thank you for. . .um, your. . .um  I gotta go. [leaves]"
"LUKE: What was going on up here?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"LUKE: Nothing? I walk in here and the two of you are like shrapnel."
"JESS: Your timing is perfect, by the way. Next time I'll hang a sock on the door."
"LUKE: Hey, there will be no hanging of socks on the door in my house, do you hear me?"
"JESS: Relax, I was kidding."
"LUKE: Oh, really? Hanging socks on doors  that's your idea of funny."
"JESS: Depending on the sock design, could be hilarious."
"LUKE: Okay, that's it, sit down."
"JESS: Why?"
"LUKE: It's time to lay down a few ground rules, sit. All right, first off, when she is up here, that door stays open."
"JESS: Excuse me?"
"LUKE: You are not allowed on either end of this apartment. You are, instead, to remain here in the middle portion of the room. You may sit on the couch or on the chair, as long as you two are sitting on separate seats, i.e. when you're on the couch, then she's on the chair. When she's on the couch, then you're on the chair."
"JESS: I get it, thank you."
"LUKE: On weekdays, you will have her home by nine. On weekends, you will have her home by eleven. Any evidence of alcohol, cigarette smoke, or anything else that Nancy Reagan would find unacceptable and you will not be allowed near her without an adult present. Are these rules clear?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: Good."
"JESS: May I speak?"
"LUKE: If you must."
"JESS: Do you want me to have you committed or would you prefer to check yourself in?"
"LUKE: I'm not joking here, mister."
"JESS: You know you're my guardian, not hers, right?"
"LUKE: You don't need a guardian."
"JESS: She tried to kiss me."
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: She did that thing where you stretch and then you put your arm around the other person's shoulder and then you sneeze and then your hand falls and you try to grab "
"LUKE: Jess, stop it."
"JESS: What do you think is gonna happen?"
"LUKE: You know what I think is gonna happen."
"JESS: No, I don't. Tell me. Tell me what I'm gonna do to her."
"LUKE: You're not gonna do anything to her because when you're at her place, there's Lorelai, and when you're here, there's me, and when you're out there, there's Taylor."
"JESS: Romeo and Juliet had warring families and they still managed to do a little damage, you know?"
"LUKE: Well, as soon as I catch you in a pair of tights, I'll get worried. Until then, do your homework."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen with a duffel bag]"
"LORELAI: Rory, let's move! They'll be here any minute."
"RORY: I'll be right there."
"LORELAI: And make sure to bring an extra coat."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Do not ask why. It's Gilmore road rules, trust me."
"RORY: But that doesn't make any sense. We're only gonna be gone for one day."
"LORELAI: Yeah, do me a favor, say those exact words to my mother when she shows up."
"RORY: Taking the coat."
"LORELAI: Now, I have been doing some research on our trip."
"RORY: Oh yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I went to the bookstore and I found this. [shows Rory a very thin book]"
"RORY: ""The Best of New Haven."""
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: It's light."
"LORELAI: It's New Haven. Anyhow, I looked through it and it just so happens that one of the best taco places on the East Coast is ten minutes from campus."
"RORY: We like tacos."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do. [reads] ""You haven't had a taco until you've spent some time at Hector's, crisp and meaty  """
"RORY: Dirty."
"LORELAI: Thank you. ""Not greasy. With homemade tortillas, it elevates this fast finger food to the level of haute cuisine."""
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, so I thought maybe when Dad was busy poofing it up, we could go say hello to Hector."
"RORY: I like your thinking."
"LORELAI: Good. Where's your stuff?"
"RORY: I put the extra coat by the door."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but where's your stuff?"
"RORY: What stuff?"
"LORELAI: Rory, I left a list on your dresser last night."
"RORY: I thought you were kidding."
"LORELAI: You didn't pack?"
"RORY: Well "
"[They walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Rory, let me explain something to you. The way you survive a road trip with my mother is to make sure you have all your bases covered, leave nothing to chance. Never give her the opportunity to give you a thirty-minute lecture on how, if you'd brought the second bathing suit like she told you to, it wouldn't have mattered that the first one's strap broke in a freak poolslide incident that no one, including the Amazing Kreskin, could've predicted, you would've been covered."
"RORY: I have to bring a bathing suit? It's thirty degrees outside."
"LORELAI: This was an example based on a true story. Now, get a skirt to go with this."
"RORY: But I'm still confused. When are we changing?"
"LORELAI: Not the point."
"RORY: We're driving, we're walking, we're eating tacos, and we're driving again."
"LORELAI: Check the list."
"RORY: Why do I need rain boots?"
"LORELAI: Why are you still questioning me?"
"RORY: Should I bring both a rain hat and an umbrella, or will one or the other do? Forget it, stupid question."
"[Lorelai finds the bracelet that Dean made for Rory on the dresser]"
"LORELAI: Oh wow. I guess this means there really isn't a Dean anymore, huh?"
"RORY: Yeah, that and it broke in the shower this morning. Though I probably would've taken it off anyway."
"LORELAI: Or Jess would've done it for you."
"RORY: What did that mean?"
"LORELAI: It just meant Jess wouldn't want you wearing another guy's bracelet."
"RORY: Or that Jess is a thief and he would've stolen it."
"LORELAI: It does work on both levels, doesn't it?"
"RORY: So this is how it's gonna be from now on?"
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: You like Dean and you hate Jess."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Jess will always be the evil guy who mouthed off to you and wrecked my car and Dean will always be the perfect guy who would come over and change the water bottle."
"LORELAI: Aw, I forgot about the water bottle."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Rory, I said nothing. I didn't mean what you thought I meant about Jess. I'm trying to be supportive about this."
"RORY: How supportive?"
"LORELAI: Supportive. You know, go team."
"RORY: I'm serious, I wanna know how it's gonna be. Like, can I invite him over?"
"LORELAI: Of course you can invite him over."
"RORY: Well, can he actually come into the house?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he can come into the house."
"RORY: Are you going to talk to him?"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"RORY: Are you going to talk to him?"
"LORELAI: I'll at least match him grunt for grunt."
"RORY: Okay. Now, let's say he's in the house and there's a fire, and you can either save him or your shoes  which is it?"
"LORELAI: That depends  did he start the fire?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Rory, I promised you before and I'm promising you again, I will cut this kid all kinds of slack. Did I like Dean? Yes. Did I worry about you less when you were with Dean? Yes. But I never expected you to be with Dean forever, just like I don't expect you to be with Jess forever."
"RORY: Oh, so now you're just waiting for the day I'm not with Jess anymore, is that it?"
"LORELAI: You know what, I'm actually looking forward to my mother getting here."
"RORY: I'm kidding and thank you."
"LORELAI: You're annoying, and you're welcome. [doorbell rings] Let the games begin."
"CUT TO THE FRONT DOOR"
"[Emily and Richard are standing on the porch]"
"EMILY: Your drivers have arrived."
"RORY: Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Hello Rory, hello Lorelai. What a perfect day for a drive."
"LORELAI: Sure is."
"EMILY: You brought an umbrella?"
"RORY: And a rain cap."
"EMILY: Excellent!"
"RICHARD: Here, let me help you with those."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[As they walk to the car, Emily notices Lorelai is carrying a coffee travel mug]"
"EMILY: Where are you going with that?"
"LORELAI: To the car."
"EMILY: You can't have that in the car."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: Well, then, what are you doing with it?"
"LORELAI: Walking it."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, I know I can't have it in the car. It will not be in the car."
"RICHARD: Is that everything?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I think so."
"RICHARD: All right, then. Let's get this show on the road."
"[Lorelai gets in the back seat and holds the mug out the window]"
"EMILY: Now let's see you drink it."
"[Lorelai sticks her head out the window and takes a sip]"
"LORELAI: Mm, good to the last drop."
"EMILY: You stay that way until it's gone."
"LORELAI: Aye, aye, captain."
"EMILY: Let's go Richard."
"RICHARD: All right-y."
"[Richard pulls away while Lorelai drinks her coffee out the window]"
"CUT TO YALE UNIVERSITY"
"[The four of them are walking through the campus]"
"LORELAI: Wow, does that guy look smart. I mean it, he's got the smart look down. The glasses, the furrowed brow, the ticky walk."
"RORY: The Kierkergaard."
"LORELAI: I really think it's the walk."
"RORY: Well, we are at Yale, you know. There are smart people here."
"LORELAI: I know there are smart people here. I just didn't realize how many. I bet if I pulled my checkbook out now, twelve guys could help me balance it."
"RICHARD: Thirteen if you were near the right building."
"RORY: Grandpa, that art gallery was amazing. Thank you."
"RICHARD: Yale has one of the finest collections of British art in the world."
"LORELAI: Louvre, schmouvre."
"RICHARD: Oh, I spent a lot of time in that gallery as a young man."
"EMILY: I'll say you did."
"LORELAI: What was that I'll say you did'?"
"EMILY: I just remember that that gallery was one of your father's favorite places to bring the ladies."
"RORY: What?"
"RICHARD: Emily."
"EMILY: It's where you took me on our first date."
"LORELAI: So, Dad liked to impress them with the paintings."
"RICHARD: Why did you bring this up?"
"EMILY: He was a master of the frown, step back, wrinkle and sigh."
"LORELAI: The what?"
"EMILY: Frown. Step back. Wrinkle. And sigh."
"RICHARD: I did no such thing."
"EMILY: And then he'd talk about the paintings he had seen in Paris and the colors of Titian, and by the end of the date, you thought he was the most brilliant man in the entire world."
"LORELAI: Using Titian to score. Even Titian didn't do that."
"RICHARD: You shouldn't tell them this. They'll think I was some kind of lothario."
"EMILY: Well, you were."
"RICHARD: I was just a young single man who wanted to experience life."
"LORELAI: Don't ever fall for that line."
"RORY: I promise."
"RICHARD: You know, Emily, you weren't such an innocent little doe lost in the woods yourself."
"EMILY: I beg your pardon?"
"LORELAI: They're turning on each other, I love it."
"RICHARD: I'll have you know, I was happily involved in a very serious relationship when your mother decided she simply had to have me."
"EMILY: Oh, the size of your ego, I swear."
"RICHARD: Linny Lott."
"EMILY: That mouse?"
"RICHARD: Oh, that mouse and I were engaged."
"EMILY: Oh, you were not."
"RICHARD: I'd given her my pin, I'd introduced her to my parents."
"EMILY: So?"
"RICHARD: The date was set, invitations mailed out."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Well, you couldn't marry Linny Lott. That woman needed directions to get to a point."
"LORELAI: Rawr!"
"EMILY: Richard Gilmore, you are going to give these girls the wrong impression."
"RORY: What impression is that, Grandma?"
"LORELAI: That you were the Helena Bonham Carter of the society set?"
"EMILY: I did not steal your grandfather, I simply gave him a choice."
"RICHARD: When you showed up at my fraternity party in that blue dress, I had no choice."
"LORELAI: You stole my father with fashion."
"EMILY: I can't believe you remember the dress."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you were the other woman."
"EMILY: Oh, this is ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Another woman should be saying this is ridiculous."
"EMILY: Will you stop?"
"[they stop next to a trash can]"
"RICHARD: Well. . ."
"EMILY: Well what?"
"RICHARD: You mean you don't remember?"
"EMILY: Oh my God! There was a bench here."
"RICHARD: They moved it last year."
"EMILY: I can't believe this."
"LORELAI: Me either. What if we wanted to sit down?"
"EMILY: This is where your father proposed?"
"RORY: Really?"
"RICHARD: That's right."
"LORELAI: By the trash can."
"EMILY: That's right."
"LORELAI: Well, that's very romantic. . .especially if you need to spit your gum out."
"EMILY: We were going to meet my girlfriends who were going to drive me back to school."
"RICHARD: And you were angry with me."
"EMILY: Because you wouldn't commit to plans for the holidays."
"RICHARD: Because I was going to invite you to the house to meet my parents after I proposed."
"EMILY: Which I didn't know because you gave me no indication whatsoever."
"RICHARD: Anyway, you had just finished calling me a spineless jellyfish."
"EMILY: And you got very annoyed, reached in your pocket, pulled out a box and said, ""Here."""
"RICHARD: And you opened the box, showed no emotion, slammed it close and said, ""Fine."""
"EMILY: Yes, I did."
"[they kiss over the trash can]"
"RORY: That's so sweet."
"EMILY: Oh no, my button broke."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah? Let me see."
"EMILY: It just broke in two and fell."
"LORELAI: Well, let me look, Mom."
"EMILY: It's a broken button, what is there to look at?"
"LORELAI: All right, then, I think there's a bathroom over there."
"EMILY: What can we do in a bathroom?"
"LORELAI: Meet George Michael."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"[cut to inside the bathroom]"
"EMILY: I don't believe it. This is a brand new skirt."
"LORELAI: Mom, let me see."
"EMILY: I have this dinner to go tonight. What am I going to do?"
"LORELAI: Drink a lot. It's easier to explain not wearing a skirt if you're falling down drunk."
"EMILY: Thank you for the advice."
"LORELAI: You know, I can rig this til you get home."
"EMILY: You can?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, just give me five seconds here."
"[pulls something out of her purse]"
"EMILY: What is that?"
"LORELAI: It's a paper clip."
"EMILY: And what do you intend to do with that paper clip?"
"LORELAI: I intend to carve something really dirty into the bathroom door."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What rhymes with Nantucket?"
"EMILY: I'm standing here holding my skirt."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna put this paper clip through the buttonhole and then through the thread that used to hold the button, and then you're gonna put your jacket back on and there you go."
"EMILY: That's ingenious."
"LORELAI: I know. If I had a thumbtack, I could make a scud m*ssile."
"EMILY: You know, your father's having a wonderful time."
"LORELAI: Well, good."
"EMILY: It means a lot to him to share this with Rory."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: Actually, it means a lot to him to share this with you and Rory. It's very nice that you're here."
"LORELAI: Nice for you. I just found out you're not supposed to be my real mother, so I'm a little scarred."
""
""
""
"[cut to Richard and Rory outside]"
"RICHARD: See that? That is my favorite building in the whole school."
"RORY: It is?"
"RICHARD: Yes, it is."
"RORY: Why?"
"RICHARD: Because that's where the Timothy Dwight Dining Hall is."
"RORY: I thought campus food was supposed to be disgusting."
"RICHARD: Not Yale food. They have the most delicious pot roast you've ever tasted."
"RORY: I love pot roast."
"RICHARD: Who doesn't love pot roast? Are you having a good time?"
"RORY: I'm having a very good time."
"RICHARD: I'm glad. It's nice being able to show this place to another Gilmore generation. You know, one day, when your mother was ten years old, she ran into my office and she said, ""I'm going to go to Yale, just like you."" She actually took my diploma out of my office and put it in her room. She wouldn't give it back to me for about six months. This place makes you remember things. Hopefully, things you're being graded on."
"[Emily and Lorelai walk over]"
"EMILY: All right, we're all in one piece again."
"RICHARD: Oh, glad to hear it. Shall we continue?"
"LORELAI: Okay, but you're not gonna show me the vending machine where I was conceived, are you? Cause I don't think I can take it."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE YALE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING"
"[The four of them are walking through a large building]"
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Lions and tigers and bears. . ."
"RORY: Oh my."
"RICHARD: It's impressive, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'd like to open a checking account, please."
"RORY: What is this place?"
"RICHARD: This is the main administration building. Professors' offices, the dean's office. Some of the best scotch in the country can be found behind those doors."
"LORELAI: Not sure how to take that, Dad."
"RICHARD: Come on. Ah, follow me, please."
"LORELAI: What's he so excited about?"
"EMILY: Oh, who knows? Dickens must have dropped a pencil here at some point."
"RICHARD: Rory, this is the office of a very dear friend of mine. His name is Harris Fellows, and he just happens to be the Dean of Admissions."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RICHARD: That's right. And I called him just before we came down and I asked him if he had a little time to squeeze you in and he said yes."
"RORY: Squeeze me in?"
"RICHARD: For an interview."
"LORELAI: An interview for what, Dad?"
"RICHARD: An interview for Yale."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Oh, I told him all about you and your grades and how well you were doing at Chilton. Well, of course, he insisted on seeing you. He wouldn't let me off the hook."
"RORY: But I haven't applied to Yale."
"RICHARD: Oh, I told him that you weren't finished deciding, that you were being very picky. I think that made him want you even more. They can be very competitive, these Ivy League schools. He's expecting you at three. Oh, look, it's three now. Well, we timed this perfectly now, didn't we? Come on, I'll walk you in. Uh, we'll be right back."
"LORELAI: Rory, honey, you don't have to go in there."
"RICHARD: What? Well, of course she's going to go in there."
"LORELAI: Rory, honey, the only person I'm talking to, you don't have to go in there if you don't want to."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, the man is waiting."
"LORELAI: You wanna leave? Cause we could just leave."
"RORY: No, it's okay. I'll go in."
"RICHARD: Harris is a very nice man, Rory. I think you two are really going to hit it off. Come on, I'll walk you in."
"[Richard and Rory walk into the office while Lorelai and Emily wait in the hall]"
"EMILY: My skirt seems to be holding up very well. Lorelai "
"LORELAI: No."
"[Richard walks out of the office]"
"RICHARD: She shook his hand. She just reached out and shook his hand. It completely threw him off. I swear, that girl."
"LORELAI: You know what, I almost feel like a standing ovation is in order."
"RICHARD: If you're going to get dramatic, let's go outside. It echoes in here."
"LORELAI: What did you think you were doing?"
"RICHARD: I thought I was helping my granddaughter get into what is, in my opinion, the best Ivy League school in America."
"LORELAI: Even though she doesn't wanna go here?"
"RICHARD: She doesn't know she doesn't want to go here."
"LORELAI: You're unbelievable, Dad. You corner her alone the other night, without me there."
"RICHARD: Of course I did. You wouldn't let her go."
"LORELAI: Oh, I wouldn't?"
"RICHARD: I knew that the last thing in the world that you could want would be for Rory to go to Yale."
"LORELAI: And the reason for that would be?"
"RICHARD: I went to Yale, therefore Rory can't."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's right, the crazy reason."
"RICHARD: That's all right. It's your prerogative to feel that way. It's mine to make sure that Rory at least knows all her options."
"LORELAI: Aren't you supposed to slap my face with a glove before you do this?"
"RICHARD: I'm not going to discuss this with you."
"LORELAI: Well, you lied to everybody, Dad. You lied to me, you lied to Rory, I'm looking at Mom and I'm thinking you lied to her, too."
"EMILY: Lorelai, please, let's try and calm down."
"RICHARD: This is for Rory's own good."
"LORELAI: Rory's going to Harvard."
"RICHARD: We'll see."
"LORELAI: No, Rory's going to Harvard. It's already been decided without you, get it? You don't control it. And that little stunt of yours doesn't change that fact one bit."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry about the way it had to be done, but I didn't want to argue with you about it."
"LORELAI: My whole life, you have tried to control everything, and if you didn't get to control something, then you just didn't deal with it."
"RICHARD: That's ridiculous."
"LORELAI: When you couldn't control me, you didn't deal with me."
"RICHARD: This has nothing to do with you."
"LORELAI: No?"
"RICHARD: This is about Rory and Rory's education. Which, frankly Lorelai, is something you know nothing about."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RICHARD: You never went to college, let alone an Ivy League college. You don't know the first thing about the system, the way it works. I do, I went through it. You want Rory to go to Harvard that badly? Well, so do thousands of other mothers. Yale is an excellent school, the equal of Harvard in every way except one  I went here. I'm an alumnus. That makes it easier for Rory to get in. And if you had any idea about the way the system works, you'd know this."
"LORELAI: Oh, so, here it is. I knew we would eventually get to the big ""my daughter's a loser, poor me, the future squandered, the Gilmore name's sullied"" speech."
"RICHARD: I am not going to leave Rory's education to chance simply because I might risk offending you. Her future is more important than your pride. If you don't like that, I'm sorry. If it makes you angry, well, what else is new? But that, my dear girl, is the way it is."
"LORELAI: I'm calling a cab. We're leaving."
"[Lorelai walks out of the building, Emily follows her]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, come back inside. Lorelai, put the phone away and come back inside."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Yes, hi, in New Haven, I need a number of a cab company. Um, anyone, pick one. Thanks."
"EMILY: You are not going to take a cab all the way back to Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: He lied to you, too, Mom. Don't you care about that?"
"EMILY: That is between me and your father."
"LORELAI: Great, whatever. Damn, I just forgot the number."
"EMILY: If you would just calm down and look at it from his point of view."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hi, um, uh, in New Haven, I need a cab company, any cab company."
"EMILY: Your father is a very strong-willed man, Lorelai. You know this, you take after him."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Thank you."
"EMILY: He wants the best for Rory. He thinks this is the best."
"LORELAI: It doesn't really matter what he thinks. It matters what I think and what Rory thinks and the list ends there."
"EMILY: So Rory takes a meeting at Yale. That doesn't mean she still won't go to Harvard."
"LORELAI: I know it doesn't, because she is still going to Harvard."
"EMILY: If she applies to Yale "
"LORELAI: She's not applying to Yale!"
"EMILY: And gets into Yale, that might even make her more appealing to Harvard. Have you thought about that?"
"LORELAI: No, I haven't, because I'm not trying to reason away a crazy man's actions."
"EMILY: Oh, don't do this. Don't turn this into yet another one of your crusades against your childhood. Just let it go. Realize that despite the matter in which your father did this, his intentions were honorable."
"LORELAI: You know what, Mom? Sometimes I literally sit around and try to figure out why Dad and I have such an awful relationship. I try to figure out why we can't communicate and why we can't seem to break through whatever crap it is that stands between us, and then something like this happens and suddenly it's like, Oh yeah. That's why.'"
"EMILY: Fine, Lorelai, your father's a demon. He's cruel and out to destroy your happiness. But think about this  you're fighting so hard to send Rory off to Harvard no matter what that you haven't even stopped for one second to consider that if she went to Yale, she could live at home. Consider that on your cab ride."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hi, yes, in New Haven, I need a cab company."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING"
"[Rory and the Dean of Admissions walk out of the office]"
"HARRIS: It was a pleasure to meet you. I'll read that book you recommended."
"RORY: And don't be fooled by the Oprah seal on the cover, it's actually very good."
"RICHARD: Well, how did it go? I see that everyone is smiling."
"HARRIS: Richard, your granddaughter is everything you said and more. You should be very proud."
"RICHARD: I am, very proud."
"HARRIS: It was very nice meeting you."
"RORY: Same here."
"HARRIS: I'll see you at dinner later, Richard."
"RICHARD: Thanks, Harris."
"[Harris walks away]"
"RICHARD: Well, that  that sounded like it went very well. Uh, what did you tell him to read?"
"RORY: Why did you do that?"
"RICHARD: Do what?"
"RORY: Why did you make this appointment without telling me about it?"
"RICHARD: Rory, I know this appointment upset your mother, but this was an important opportunity."
"RORY: I know it was an important opportunity. That's why I can't believe you didn't prepare me for it. I didn't have my transcripts, my letters of recommendation. I couldn't even remember what I wanted to major in when he asked."
"RICHARD: I'm sure he knew you were nervous."
"RORY: But I didn't have to be that nervous. I could've been calm. I could've brushed my hair. I never would've worn this."
"RICHARD: Oh, Rory, none of this matters."
"RORY: It matters to me. I like to be prepared. This has nothing to do with Mom. If you had really wanted me to take this meeting, I would've done it just because you asked me to. And I would've done it right."
"[Lorelai and Emily walk back into the building]"
"LORELAI: Rory, a cab is meeting us at the main gate. Let's go."
"RORY: I'm coming. Bye Grandma."
"EMILY: Goodbye Rory."
"[Lorelai and Rory leave]"
"EMILY: [to Richard] Don't you even look at me."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory get out of a cab and start walking down the sidewalk]"
"LORELAI: Thanks. Uh, well, here's the good news. You no longer have to worry about which college to go to cause that cab ride was your college tuition."
"RORY: Can we not say the word college for at least forty-eight hours?"
"LORELAI: Fine."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: How bout collage, can we say collage? Cause it sounds the same but it's actually very different."
"RORY: Collage is fine."
"LORELAI: Okay, good, cause I don't even know how to get through a conversation without the word collage."
"RORY: I should've listened to you about today."
"LORELAI: Oh, no. There's no way even I could've seen this one coming."
"[they walk into the diner]"
"RORY: I can't believe I had a meeting at Yale today."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: And I can't believe the only name that popped into my head when he asked for my role model was Gloria Estefan."
"LORELAI: Well, you don't work great under pressure."
"RORY: Sucky day."
"LORELAI: But excellent tacos."
"RORY: Yeah, Hector really came through."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: We're coming from a day with my parents. Want a taco?"
"LUKE: Uh, no thanks. See, I already have food here. We sell it to the other customers who don't come quite as prepared as the two of you."
"LORELAI: Mm, be nice and get us some salsa."
"LUKE: At least order a cup of coffee."
"RORY: Coffee and tacos?"
"LORELAI: Sounds just gross enough to work."
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Hi."
"LUKE: Please, I'll finish it  hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. I'm getting the coffee."
"JESS: I gotta run out for a second and get a part for my car."
"LUKE: Get a receipt this time."
"JESS: I'll be back. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, what's the record for most tacos eaten in a diner that doesn't actually sell tacos?"
"LUKE: I have no idea."
"LORELAI: Find out, will you, cause if it's less than five, we're famous."
"LUKE: Where'd you get those things anyhow?"
"LORELAI: New Haven."
"LUKE: Really? That dump was close?"
"LORELAI: We paid a little visit to Yale today."
"RORY: Yes, one that I would prefer not to relive, thank you very much. I'm gonna go study."
"LORELAI: Okay hon, see you back home."
"RORY: Bye Luke."
"LUKE: Bye."
"[Rory leaves; Luke sits down with Lorelai]"
"LUKE: Uh, listen, I just want you to know that I had a little talk with Jess earlier."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"LUKE: Yes, I did, and I really laid down the rules concerning him and Rory. Trust me, he now knows that I am going to be watching them every second they are together."
"LORELAI: Oh good."
"LUKE: Yup."
"LORELAI: You know, they're together now."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. I have to get a part for my car', I'm going to go study'  that's kid code for Meet me at the previously agreed upon location far away from my clueless uncle.'"
"LUKE: You're kidding me, right? You don't really think that. . .damn, they are! They're together. They used the kid code and now they're together!"
"LORELAI: It's okay, Luke."
"LUKE: It's okay, Luke? They are out there right now doing God knows what, completely unsupervised. How did you let this happen?"
"LORELAI: Me?"
"LUKE: Yes, you. I thought you were against this."
"LORELAI: I thought you were all, This is so great and Rory's gonna change Jess.'"
"LUKE: What is she, a miracle worker? Come on, Lorelai, wake up  the guy's trouble. I have to find them. Caesar, I'll be back in a little while."
"LORELAI: You're seriously gonna run all over town looking for Jess and Rory?"
"LUKE: If I have to, yes. And if you were really a concerned mother, you'd go out there with me."
"LORELAI: No, I can't do that. But if you like, I'll let you sniff Rory's sweater. Maybe her scent will help you track them down."
"LUKE: The things you find amusing astound me sometimes."
"[Luke grabs Rory's sweater from the chair]"
"LORELAI: You're not really gonna sniff it."
"LUKE: No, it's cold out. She might need it."
"CUT TO GAS STATION"
"[Jess stands next to a gas pump holding an unlit cigarette as Rory walks up to him]"
"RORY: You going to smoke that or mind meld with it?"
"JESS: It depends."
"RORY: So where's the part for your car?"
"JESS: Huh, I don't know. Gypsy said she was gonna leave it for me somewhere. Guess she forgot."
"RORY: She's bad that way."
"JESS: I'm just gonna have to take my business elsewhere."
"RORY: Looks that way."
"JESS: So."
"RORY: So."
"JESS: Here we are."
"RORY: Yeah, here we are. So, tell me, what's your decision about smoking that depending on?"
"JESS: On what's gonna happen."
"RORY: When?"
"JESS: Now."
"[They kiss]"
"RORY: I'm glad you didn't smoke it."
"JESS: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"[they kiss again]"
"JESS: Well, whatever else happens between us, at least we know that part works. What?"
"RORY: I have to go."
"JESS: What? Did I do something or "
"RORY: No, no. This was. . . you were  are. . .it was wonderful, and I look forward to many similar occurrences in the future, but right now, I have to go. Understand?"
"JESS: Not at all."
"RORY: It's more fun that way, isn't it?"
"JESS: Come here. [kisses her] b*at it."
"RORY: I'll see you tomorrow."
"CUT TO DEAN'S HOUSE"
"[Rory knocks on Dean's bedroom window, he opens it]"
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: What are you doing?"
"RORY: I climbed a tree."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: Well, I was afraid to ring the doorbell cause your mom would answer and I assume she knows, so I assume she hates me and I just wanted to talk to you, so. . ."
"DEAN: She doesn't know."
"RORY: She doesn't."
"DEAN: I haven't really been in the mood to talk about it."
"RORY: But you're going to have to tell her eventually, so if she did answer the door and was nice to me, then I would've known that she was going to be hating me soon, and that just would've been really hard because I like your mom. I guess you're probably gonna tell your sister also, so she's probably gonna hate me, too."
"DEAN: Well, too bad, Rory. Somebody doesn't like you for once."
"RORY: I didn't mean "
"DEAN: What do you want?"
"RORY: Do you remember that girl Butterfly who lived in a tree for a year? I can officially attest that she was nuts."
"DEAN: I have to go."
"RORY: I wanna say that I'm sorry."
"DEAN: For what?"
"RORY: For treating you the way I did. For doing all the things you said I did. I am so, so sorry. It's all my fault. I don't know what's wrong with me. You were the most amazing boyfriend in the world. You made me so happy. You made me laugh, you made my mother like you, you were nice to my friends, you protected me, you even came with me to that stupid debutante ball."
"DEAN: I don't need the list."
"RORY: I really did love you. Please believe that."
"DEAN: You with him now?"
"RORY: I don't wanna talk about him. I just came to tell you that I'm truly sorry that I hurt you, and that I'm going to miss you so much, and I just hope that someday you won't hate me anymore."
"DEAN: I hope so, too."
"[Dean closes the window]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is studying on the couch as Lorelai walks into the room with two mugs]"
"LORELAI: Coffee and Ovaltine."
"RORY: Thanks."
"LORELAI: It's getting late, you almost done?"
"RORY: Almost."
"LORELAI: Don't study so much that you get brilliant, go mad, grow a big bald egghead and try to take over the world, okay, cause I wanna go shoe shopping this weekend."
"RORY: Promise, I will not go mad until we get you some boots."
"LORELAI: Thank you. [starts to walk upstairs, then turns around] Hey."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: How was the rest of the evening?"
"RORY: It was eventful."
"LORELAI: Eventful. . . well, okay. Goodnight hon. [starts to go upstairs]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: [turns around] Yeah?"
"RORY: Details tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Ah, thank God. Cause you know what not knowing these things does to me."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: I can't sleep. I wonder what I did wrong. Should I not have left you that first day in kindergarten when you begged me not to? Are you holding it against me?"
"RORY: I was fine staying at kindergarten. You were the one that had trouble leaving."
"LORELAI: See, see how irrational I get when you hold out on me? I invent crazy reasons why you hold out on me."
"RORY: Night Mom."
"LORELAI: Night babe. [goes upstairs]"
"[Later that night, Rory walks into her bedroom, turns out the light and tries to go to sleep. A moment later, she turns the light back on, grabs her Yale brochure from her night table and starts reading it. Upstairs, Lorelai is reading the same brochure in her bedroom.]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are on the couch watching television]"
"RORY: I like these women."
"LORELAI: I love these women."
"RORY: Poor Edie."
"LORELAI: Which Edie?"
"RORY: Little Edie. She's just trying to sing and her mom won't stop talking."
"LORELAI: Big Edie was so beautiful in her day."
"RORY: They were both pretty."
"LORELAI: I can't believe they were related to Jackie."
"RORY: Well, the Kennedy's kind of hid them in the background for many years."
"LORELAI: Well, when you're a Kennedy, how do you even choose who in the family to hide?"
"RORY: It's a tough choice."
"LORELAI: Something beautiful about them though. They're cool, they're free."
"RORY: Yeah, and they're memorable. Most people are very forgettable. And they're happy."
"LORELAI: They had their cats."
"RORY: And their raccoons."
"LORELAI: And their pretty house."
"RORY: And each other."
"LORELAI: Add a few years and they're us."
"RORY: Yeah. . .yeah."
"LORELAI: Yeah."

"CUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie rushes around giving instructions]"
"SOOKIE: Rhiana, run it through the sieve again, I want it smooth as glass. Don't cut corners, people!"
"LORELAI: Is she melting down?"
"MICHEL: Like butter on a k*ll."
"LORELAI: Sookie. . ."
"SOOKIE: Just a sec, hon. How's your love life, Pete? A little frustrated, I bet. Wondering how I know that? Cause you're taking it out on my egg whites. Gently, fold them gently. Cheryl  you're slicing not dicing, I can hear it in the chop. Adjust, my friend."
"LORELAI: Sookie, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, let's talk."
"SOOKIE: I'm extremely lacking in time here."
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"SOOKIE: Uh, chaos? Uh, a travesty of cooking? It's a salmonella laboratory in here!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, the kitchen will be in good hands."
"SOOKIE: But not in my hands."
"LORELAI: It'll be in Bob hands. Bob has great hands."
"SOOKIE: No, you know what Bob has? Bob has two seconds to get the hollandaise off the flame before I break his neck!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, listen, you hired Bob. You trained him in your image. He's great, and he's subbed for you before."
"SOOKIE: But this is Thanksgiving, he has never done Thanksgiving."
"LORELAI: He's ready, he'll sub for you seamlessly. Even Big Joe Newsanchor's have substitutes."
"SOOKIE: And that's the thing. They still say, And now the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.' You see? Dan is still associated with it even though he's off snorkeling or something, just like I'm gonna be associated with the dinner because Bob is substituting for Sookie. Excuse me one minute."
"[Sookie starts rummaging through the trash can]"
"MICHEL: Oh, this can only be good."
"LORELAI: Sookie, that's the garbage. Stop rooting through the garbage."
"SOOKIE: I will when people stop throwing away useful stuff!"
"LORELAI: Drop, drop the, drop the tops, drop them, drop them. Come here, come here, come here. Now, Sookie, listen to me because you're torturing yourself here."
"[Emily walks in and stands behind Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: Emily, hi."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's nice. That's very high school. Stick with me here."
"SOOKIE: Good to see you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, ah, that's funny. You know who's behind you? It's Joseph Stalin, my good friend. What are you doing back from the dead, Joe?"
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom! Ah, geez, you scared me."
"EMILY: You heard Sookie greet me."
"LORELAI: Oh, I thought it was a joke."
"EMILY: Like comparing me to Joseph Stalin?"
"LORELAI: I wasn't comparing you to Joseph Stalin."
"EMILY: I'm in a hurry. Can we speak for a minute?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I guess, for a minute. So, were you in the area or something?"
"EMILY: Not really."
"LORELAI: Then what are you doing here?"
"EMILY: I wanted to talk to you."
"LORELAI: Phone's out of order?"
"EMILY: Let's not play games here."
"LORELAI: Games?"
"EMILY: I've called several times the past few weeks and you've k*ll avoided every call."
"LORELAI: No, that's not true. I've left messages on your machine."
"EMILY: Yes, messages. And then if I happened to pick up, you'd hang up. Or if the maid picked up, you'd ask for me, then claim you were driving through a tunnel so you might get cut off, and then you'd make garbling noises and hang up."
"LORELAI: Fine, Mom, we're talking now. What's up?"
"EMILY: Are you feeling well?"
"LORELAI: You came all the way out here to ask me that?"
"EMILY: Well, you've been sick these past few Friday's for dinner, so I was concerned. That's why you didn't come, right, because you were sick? So are you better? You look fine."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's the makeup. I'm still. . .uh, these allergies really just hit me like a ton of bricks."
"EMILY: I've never heard you mention allergies before."
"LORELAI: I'm a silent sufferer."
"EMILY: Well, I certainly hope you're feeling better now because I want you to come to dinner tomorrow night."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving."
"EMILY: Yes, it is Thanksgiving. And before you sift through the dozen or so excuses you always have on hand, let me have my say. You've missed two dinners and avoided my calls because you're mad at us about what happened at Yale. But I want you and Rory at Thanksgiving this year."
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: If you have plans "
"LORELAI: We do have plans."
"EMILY: Alter them. Now, there'll be other people there, so the focus won't be on you, and you may even be able to get by without saying more than hello', goodbye', and pass the gravy'."
"LORELAI: We already have plans."
"EMILY: Your father and I are going out of town the next day and we'll be gone all of December, including Christmas, so it's the last chance for the family to be together for the rest of the year."
"LORELAI: Look "
"EMILY: And I want you to remember that I am not the one who set the meeting for Rory behind your back. I want you there, Lorelai. And if you're still sick, I don't want a doctor's note. I want your doctor himself to come to my house and convince me that it's true, got it?"
"LORELAI: Got it."
"EMILY: See you tomorrow."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"TEACHER: The multi-layered membrane systems of the cytoplasm are the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the golgi body. Now, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is concerned with the manufacture of lipid molecules. [bell rings] We'll continue on this next week. Keep up on your reading please."
"MADELINE: That was really distracting."
"PARIS: Oh. Well, by all means, Madeline, you should point out to the faculty that their annoying custom of teaching is distracting you from more important things like nail filing and daydreaming about marrying Ryan Phillippe."
"LOUISE: Uh, he's already married."
"PARIS: Then whatever strawhead actor isn't."
"MADELINE: This was bad. For the last five minutes, every single thing she said sounded dirty."
"LOUISE: Yeah, same here."
"PARIS: Good God."
"MADELINE: I mean, reticulum? Come on."
"LOUISE: Plus, the golgi body. I mean, is it me or is that majorly pornographic?"
"PARIS: My life with the Banger sisters."
"RORY: So, changing the subject. . ."
"PARIS: Hallelujah."
"RORY: What's everybody doing for Thanksgiving?"
"PARIS: I can't even talk about Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Louise?"
"LOUISE: Im having dinner with my dad."
"MADELINE: Isn't he still in jail?"
"LOUISE: Yes, but his company donated some treadmills for the inmates so he swung a special trailer for dinner that they're gonna set up for us in the parking lot. We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us."
"MADELINE: You're lucky it's in that order."
"PARIS: My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie."
"RORY: How so?"
"PARIS: I called shelters to volunteer to serve food. It's Thanksgiving  you'd think they have needs. Nope. Every stupid soup kitchen in town turned me down because they have enough volunteers."
"MADELINE: Bummer."
"PARIS: I'm on a couple waiting lists, but it doesn't look good."
"RORY: I've never heard of too many volunteers."
"PARIS: Who are all these jackasses who volunteered anyway? They can't all be students like me. They're not all putting it on a college application. I get something out of it and these other people don't get a thing. Talk about selfish."
"LOUISE: Sore subject."
"RORY: What are you up to, Madeline?"
"MADELINE: I've got more college applications to fill out. Backups, safety schools."
"LOUISE: I've got some of that, too. I'm so behind."
"PARIS: I told you guys to have those things done by now."
"LOUISE: Sorry, Mom."
"PARIS: It's not about being sorry. It's about being prepared. I got Harvard and my backups in weeks ago."
"MADELINE: Okay, all you're doing is making me more nervous. I'll see you guys Monday."
"LOUISE: Same here."
"RORY: Yup, see you guys Monday."
"PARIS: Harvard is going to be expecting Thanksgiving shelter work. They'll know I called too late and it will totally impugn my organizational k*ll. By the way, you know I ultimately do all these things for the good of mankind, right?"
"RORY: Oh yeah."
"PARIS: Sometimes I don't think I come off that way."
"RORY: No."
"[Paris' cell phone rings]"
"PARIS: [answers phone] Hello? . . . Yes, thanks for returning my call. . . nothing? But wait, wait, wait  just stick me at any old pot. I'm small, you won't even know I'm there, I'll even bring my own ladle. . . .Oh, now, come on, work with me here. I've got a slotted spoon. . . Well, what about coffee or condiments? You got condiments covered? . . . I'm sorry, can I speak to your supervisor? . . . My attitude? What about your attitude? I'm trying to help people. It's Thanksgiving. . ."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: So she coldcocked you, huh?"
"LORELAI: She bit me, incapacitated me with her poison, and devoured me whole."
"RORY: But how are we going to go to four Thanksgiving dinners?"
"LORELAI: It's not four, is it?"
"RORY: Lane's house, Sookie's, and we always stop by Luke's. . .that's three, and Grandma and Grandpa is four."
"LORELAI: Ah, we're mad, Edie."
"RORY: We're us, Edie."
"LORELAI: Well, we've gotta go to my parents' or we'll be brought up on w*r crimes. Lane's is always super early, so that's easy to catch. Sookie's is mid afternoon."
"RORY: Luke's the toughie."
"LORELAI: Guess that's the one we'll have to skip."
"RORY: Bummer."
"LORELAI: I know, but he won't care. Holidays are nothing to him anyway."
"[Kirk walks out of The Chat Club with several bags]"
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk. Discover a new freaky fetish?"
"KIRK: What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. You buy a cat?"
"KIRK: Yup. I'm very excited."
"LORELAI: You seem it. So what's all this?"
"RORY: I'm assuming there's nothing left in the store."
"KIRK: Actually, there are a number of things left."
"RORY: No, I meant you seem to be buying a lot of stuff."
"KIRK: Oh, sorry. My excitement must be clouding my ability to judge comedic hyperbole."
"LORELAI: So where'd you get the cat?"
"KIRK: A lady had a bunch of them at the grocery store and Kirk seemed to take an instant liking to me."
"LORELAI: Kirk?"
"KIRK: Yes?"
"LORELAI: No, I mean, the cat's name is Kirk?"
"KIRK: Yup."
"LORELAI: Weird coincidence or. . ."
"KIRK: I named him Kirk."
"LORELAI: Isn't that confusing?"
"KIRK: Not when you think about it."
"[Lorelai thinks about it]"
"LORELAI: No, it's still confusing."
"KIRK: I like the name, and whenever I call Kirk's name, I obviously won't be calling myself."
"LORELAI: True."
"KIRK: Although when my mom calls for Kirk, that may be confusing. Maybe I can get her to say CatKirk when she's calling Kirk, and HumanKirk when she's calling me."
"RORY: That would keep it straight."
"KIRK: I'm glad I ran into you. See ya."
"LORELAI: See ya, HumanKirk."
"RORY: Bye HumanKirk."
"[Kirk walks away]"
"RORY: He's always been a cat person, he's just never had a cat."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Anywhere?"
"LUKE: Anywhere."
"LORELAI: [to customer at table] Hm, would you mind moving?"
"LUKE: I hate when you do that."
"LORELAI: It's my showstopper."
"LUKE: An empty table."
"LORELAI: Ah. You ready to order?"
"RORY: I'm ready."
"LUKE: Don't bother, saw you coming, already ordered your Wednesday usual  the French dip, extra fries, the every-Wednesday cherry pie."
"RORY: Such service."
"LORELAI: Oh, and such a food rut we're in."
"RORY: Thank you, Luke."
"LUKE: I gotta get back to stuffing my turkey."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, do you have time to do that and prep your Thanksgiving food?"
"LUKE: Stop it."
"RORY: Here, here."
"LUKE: It's a tedious job."
"LORELAI: Well, what if we told you you could stuff one less?"
"LUKE: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: We got jammed. Shanghaied by my mother and what with the other things we have going. . .well, too many commitments, not enough us."
"LUKE: So?"
"RORY: We can't make it tomorrow."
"LUKE: Oh, okay, fine."
"LORELAI: It was beyond our control."
"LUKE: That's fine, whatever. I'll be right back. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Um, okay, I may be crazy, but he almost looked. . . ."
"RORY: Disappointed."
"LORELAI: Yes, disappointed. We disappointed Luke."
"RORY: I didn't think it was possible."
"LORELAI: Our powers are greater than we know."
"RORY: He actually likes it when we come for Thanksgiving. All these years and we never knew."
"LORELAI: Hm, he's the Grinch and we're Cindy Lou Who."
"RORY: So Cindy Lou, what do we do?"
"LORELAI: I got it."
"[Lorelai picks up her cell phone as Luke walks over]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Oh, uh, perfect. That works great. Okay, bye now. [hangs up] Sorry, I'm just clarifying the schedule for tomorrow. As luck has it, we can make it. We'll definitely be here."
"LUKE: It's okay."
"LORELAI: No, it's all cleared. That was my mom, and, uh, the time's just gonna work out just fine."
"LUKE: Really, you don't have to. I already stopped prepping the last turkey."
"LORELAI: Well, start prepping it again cause we are coming."
"LUKE: I don't want you to feel like you have to come."
"LORELAI: This is tiring."
"RORY: I can kneel behind him and you can push him over."
"LORELAI: It may come to that."
"LUKE: It won't be a hassle?"
"LORELAI: It won't be a hassle."
"LUKE: You sure?"
"LORELAI: We're coming, now go away and let us eat. Shoo, shoo."
"[Luke walks away]"
"RORY: That was very nice."
"LORELAI: Well, I hate disappointing people."
"RORY: Okay, now, practical question. . . how are we going to eat four Thanksgiving dinners?"
"LORELAI: How? Rory, what are we if not world champion eaters?"
"RORY: It's too much food."
"LORELAI: It's not too much food. This is what we've been training for our whole lives. This is our destiny. This is our finest hour."
"RORY: Or final hour."
"LORELAI: No, no. Get inspired and tomorrow I guarantee you, we will be standing on the Olympic platform receiving our gold medals for eating. We are not Michelle Kwan-ing this."
"RORY: Okay, okay, four dinners."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we'll skip the rolls."
"RORY: That'll help. You know, we might wanna consider not eating much now in preparation for our finest hour. A little fasting so that we can enjoy more tomorrow, hm?"
"LORELAI: Unnecessary."
"RORY: Yeah."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[On Thanksgiving morning, Lorelai and Rory are walking toward the market]"
"RORY: What's on the list?"
"LORELAI: Flowers for everyone we're visiting and cranberry sauce for the Kims."
"RORY: Tums."
"LORELAI: You mean amateur pills?"
"RORY: Just in case."
"LORELAI: Okay, Tums."
"RORY: I'll do the flowers."
"LORELAI: I'll do Doose's."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[Lorelai goes into the market. Jess walks up behind Rory]"
"JESS: Hey there."
"RORY: Hey. [he kisses her, but Rory pulls away] Wait, stop."
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: Stop."
"JESS: What are you doing?"
"RORY: Come on. [Rory pulls him down the sidewalk a little, then kisses him]"
"JESS: What was that?"
"RORY: That was a kiss."
"JESS: What's with the relocation before the kiss?"
"RORY: It's too early."
"JESS: Too early? Too early for what?"
"RORY: For kissing like that."
"JESS: What's the rule, no kissing before noon?"
"RORY: No, it's too early to do this here."
"JESS: Where, in the street?"
"RORY: In the street, with people watching..."
"JESS: What people?"
"RORY: In front of Doose's."
"JESS: Ah, Doose's."
"RORY: We shouldn't flaunt it."
"JESS: But I want to flaunt it."
"RORY: It doesn't feel right."
"JESS: He's a big boy Rory."
"RORY: I know."
"JESS: It's not the first time a couple's broken up."
"RORY: It is for us."
"JESS: This is insane."
"RORY: Please, let's not flaunt it, please?"
"JESS: For how long?"
"RORY: Until it's comfortable."
"JESS: Before we're on Social Security?"
"RORY: I promise, we can kiss secretly."
"JESS: Yeah, or we can wear Three Stooges masks all the time, that way no one will know who we are."
"RORY: I can be Curly."
"JESS: I'll be Moe."
"RORY: Probably too silly."
"JESS: Yeah, probably."
"RORY: This will get better over time, I promise. But until then, let's just play it cool."
"JESS: Hey, I'm Frank at the Sands."
"RORY: That's cool."
"CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Lorelai is shopping]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, Kirk. Doing your holiday shopping?"
"KIRK: Well, shopping, yes, and it is a holiday, but my shopping isn't holiday related, so technically no."
"LORELAI: Oh, what happened there?"
"KIRK: Oh, nothing, just a little scratch."
"LORELAI: Looks like a big scratch. Wow, Bactine, Neosporin, Mercurochrome  what's with all the pharmacologicals?"
"KIRK: Oh, well, Kirk and I are going through a little adjustment period, that's all."
"LORELAI: CatKirk?"
"KIRK: It's no biggie, and this looks a lot worse than it is."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I can see that. So how'd it happen? Were you playing or something?"
"KIRK: We haven't actually played yet. This happened when I accidentally walked into the room without announcing myself."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"KIRK: I've discovered Kirk likes my presence announced before I enter any room that he's in."
"LORELAI: You have to announce yourself?"
"KIRK: Yeah, just a quick, Is it okay if I come in?' from the adjacent room. Otherwise, he gets a little testy."
"LORELAI: Hence the scratch."
"KIRK: It's just a small laceration. Again, no biggie."
"LORELAI: Kirk, he got your neck!"
"KIRK: That was another mistake of mine. I put his food bowl down in front of him. He doesn't like that. Or she doesn't."
"LORELAI: She? I thought Kirk was a boy."
"KIRK: That was just a guess. He actually hasn't exposed his underside to me yet. Or hers."
"LORELAI: Well, here's hoping your cat exposes itself to you soon."
"KIRK: From your mouth to God's ears. See ya."
"LORELAI: See ya."
"[Lorelai walks over to Dean]"
"LORELAI: Hi there."
"DEAN: Hi."
"LORELAI: So you pulled the Thanksgiving shift, huh?"
"DEAN: Yeah, I get time and a half."
"LORELAI: Well, good, good. It's good to see you."
"DEAN: Same here. Um, so, I gotta work."
"LORELAI: Right, right. That Taylor's a dictator."
"DEAN: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Dean, wait. Um, look, we live in a teeny tiny little hamlet here. I mean, stick it in an envelope and we could mail the whole town for a buck-forty. It makes avoiding people tough and uncomfortable."
"DEAN: I know."
"LORELAI: I hate hiding from people, especially when I don't wanna hide from them. You were a pal. You were so good to Rory. You were the best first boyfriend a mother could've hoped for."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"LORELAI: It's okay to keep avoiding me if you want. I just wanted you to know that you don't need to, okay? Just because you and Rory broke up doesn't mean we did."
"DEAN: Good. That's good to hear."
"LORELAI: Well, Happy Thanksgiving."
"DEAN: Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai walks out of the diner with a bag. Rory is waiting with several bouquets of flowers]"
"LORELAI: Aw, pretty!"
"RORY: Yeah, good selection today. You get everything?"
"LORELAI: And then some. Look."
"RORY: Chocolate turkeys, nice!"
"LORELAI: I think they'll add a festive air."
"RORY: Definitely. So, was he in there?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, he was."
"RORY: Good, good. I hope he's good. Did he seem good?"
"LORELAI: He seemed good. He's getting time and a half."
"RORY: Good, good."
"LORELAI: So, let's go eat."
"RORY: And eat and eat."
"LORELAI: And eat and eat and eat."
"RORY: And eat and eat and eat and eat. . ."
"LORELAI: And eat and eat and eat and eat. . ."
"RORY: And eat some more."
"LORELAI: And eat and eat."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs. Kim opens the door; Lorelai and Rory are on the porch]"
"MRS. KIM: Ah, the Gilmores. Happy Thanksgiving."
"LORELAI: Happy Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Happy Thanksgiving."
"MRS. KIM: Come in."
"LORELAI: She's in a good mood this year."
"RORY: Downright chipper."
"LORELAI: So, um, Mrs. Kim, we, uh, we brought gifts."
"RORY: Flowers."
"LORELAI: And cranberry sauce, our little Thanksgiving tradition."
"MRS. KIM: Thank you, can never have too much."
"RORY: That's what we say."
"LORELAI: Plus, a chocolate turkey."
"MRS. KIM: What should I do with this?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know, let the kids share it."
"MRS. KIM: And then send a blank check to their dentist?"
"LORELAI: They don't have to eat it, they can play with it."
"MRS. KIM: Play with chocolate? It's missing its head."
"LORELAI: Ooh, that one's ours. Here, this one has a head. There ya go."
"MRS. KIM: Okay. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: My arms are too short to box with Mrs. Kim."
"RORY: The singing's already g*n."
"LORELAI: Mm. Who's that playing guitar? He looks familiar."
"RORY: Oh my God, that's Lane's Dave."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, it is. He's all neat and tidy."
"RORY: He's gone corporate."
"LORELAI: He's gone Korean."
"[Lane walks by and sees them]"
"LANE: Oh, hey, hi."
"RORY: Hey yourself. Hey, how'd you get your mom to let you "
"LANE: Come on, girls, let's get you some punch. [leads them to the other room]"
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LANE: That is not Dave Rygalski."
"LORELAI: Oh, intrigue."
"RORY: Who is it?"
"LANE: I mean, not the one that I'm in a band with. That is Dave Rygalski, local Christian guitar player that my mom and I met very briefly and innocently at the dance marathon, and that I coincidentally ran across again when I found his ad seeking Christian guitar accompaniment gigs up on our church bulletin board."
"LORELAI: Complicated."
"LANE: I even put the fake ad up at church and pretended to find it with my mom next to me."
"RORY: You're good."
"LORELAI: So, are you guys dating?"
"LANE: We're laying the groundwork. If she gets to know him before we date and she approves of him, we won't have to hide anything."
"LORELAI: Right, except how you met."
"RORY: And who he really is."
"LANE: But other than that, it's completely fib-free. Shh, shh!"
"MRS. KIM: Watch it. You break it, you buy it. Ten percent off for cousins, twenty percent off for nephews and nieces."
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Lane walk into the room where the food table is set up]"
"LORELAI: Yung Kwan, good to see you. Hee Kim, hi. Oh, I love your hair. Su Nam, hi. Hi. Ho Kyung, Wan Kyu, great to see you, hi. Oh, Mrs. Kim, just a beautiful table, as always."
"MRS. KIM: Try the tofurkey. Turkey made from tofu."
"RORY: Oh, we definitely will."
"LORELAI: Mm."
"MRS. KIM: And meet the guitar player. Nice young man, big fan of tofurkey. David?"
"DAVE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: This is Rory Gilmore and Mrs. Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Hi, nice to meet you."
"DAVE: Oh, same here."
"RORY: I think I've seen you around town."
"DAVE: Yeah, that might be a possibility. Happy Thanksgiving."
"LORELAI: Same to you."
"MRS. KIM: Hymn 17 please."
"DAVE: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Wow, he seems like a very upright young man."
"MRS. KIM: Not a bad sight-reader either. [walks away]"
"RORY: You're taking tofurkey?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh, and some extra napkins to slip the tofurkey into when no one is looking and then toss them away."
"RORY: Very smart."
"LANE: Um, Mama, just a thought, but maybe we can take a break from the hymns while we eat?"
"MRS. KIM: No break, he's paid to play. We can quit singing for now, but he should play soft in the background, okay?"
"DAVE: Yeah. Yes, ma'am."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: The best laid plans."
"LORELAI: Tell me about it."
"RORY: How do you feel?"
"LORELAI: I ate tofurkey. How do you think I feel?"
"RORY: Tofurkier."
"LORELAI: Drat that Mrs. Kim for not taking her eyes off me the whole time. . . it's like she was anticipating my napkin maneuver."
"[They walk up to Sookie's yard. Sookie is sitting at a picnic table, and a group of people is standing near the porch]"
"LORELAI: Hi hon!"
"RORY: Happy Thanksgiving."
"SOOKIE: Ah, thank you. Thank God, civilization has arrived."
"LORELAI: What's wrong?"
"SOOKIE: What's wrong? Uh, do you not see what's going on here?"
"LORELAI: What's that?"
"SOOKIE: That is a vat of boiling oil."
"LORELAI: Really? Where's Quasimodo?"
"SOOKIE: This is not a joking matter."
"RORY: What is the oil for?"
"LORELAI: For pouring on visigoths."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: When else am I gonna get to use my visigoth material?"
"RORY: What's the oil for?"
"SOOKIE: The turkey. My beautiful, expensive, organically grown turkey."
"LORELAI: I don't get it."
"SOOKIE: A couple of days ago, Jackson asked me if he could cook the turkey. I thought he was gonna roast it, stick a couple of onions around it, something simple. So I said yes, figuring that the minute he put it in the oven and leaves the kitchen, I can sneak in and give it a nice herb-bitter rub and stuff it with a pancetta-chestnut stuffing."
"LORELAI: Sure, cause he'd never notice that."
"SOOKIE: Exactly. Then the propane t*nk arrived, and the industrial burner, and the fifteen gallons of peanut oil. Then he springs it on me  I'm gonna deep-fry a turkey."""
"LORELAI: Deep-fried turkey."
"RORY: Interesting."
"SOOKIE: I tried to talk him out of it, but I'd already promised and now he's excited about it."
"GUY 1: Hey, what's keeping Jackson? Is he on the pot or something?"
"SOOKIE: Lots of precious memories in the making here."
"GUY 1: Hey Jackson, get your butt out here with that gobbler!"
"SOOKIE: A gobbler."
"RORY: Maybe it won't be that bad."
"LORELAI: Yeah, deep-frying's kind of in now."
"SOOKIE: I don't care. You don't deep-fry turkey. Uh, filet of fish, yes. A batch of fries, yes. A donut, yes. Not turkey."
"GUY 1: Come on, let's get going!"
"GUY 2: Yeah, we're hungry!"
"EVERYONE: Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson. . ."
"[Jackson pushes open the door and holds up the turkey]"
"JACKSON: Did someone say. . .Jackson?"
"[the crowd cheers]"
"LORELAI: Wow, it's like Thunderdome in here."
"SOOKIE: He should've just driven it out on a monster truck. He's shamelessly catering to his demographic."
"JACKSON: Are you ready?"
"[the crowd cheers]"
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, I can't look."
"EVERYONE: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. . ."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, they're counting down."
"EVERYONE: . . .five, four, three, two, one!"
"[Jackson lowers the turkey into the vat]"
"LORELAI: It's in the vat."
"SOOKIE: It's like a death in the family."
"LORELAI: Look at the bright side, Sookie. At least this took your mind off the dinner at the inn."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, the inn. What if Bob decides to do something equally awful to the turkey at the inn? I have to call him."
"JACKSON: Oh, hey guys."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"JACKSON: Neat, huh? And it only takes forty minutes."
"LORELAI: Cool."
"JACKSON: How ya doing, hon?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, fine, Sweets. [Lorelai hands her a beer] And keep them coming."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Hey everybody."
"BABETTE: Oh, hey there dollfaces. Happy Thanksgiving."
"MOREY: Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Hey. [hands Luke a bouquet of flowers]"
"LUKE: What's this?"
"RORY: Flowers."
"LUKE: What do I do with them?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, not this again."
"RORY: Put them in a vase with water."
"LUKE: I don't have a vase."
"LORELAI: You do this every year."
"LUKE: I don't have vases."
"LORELAI: Buy a vase."
"LUKE: But I don't need a vase cause I never have flowers."
"LORELAI: Except when we bring you flowers every year on Thanksgiving. Buy a vase."
"LUKE: Stop bringing me flowers."
"LORELAI: Stop bringing me flowers. I knew you were gonna say that because you say the same thing. We have this same exact conversation every year."
"LUKE: And every year you point that out."
"LORELAI: And every year you point that out."
"LUKE: And every year you point that out."
"RORY: And then every year we put the flowers on the counter and forget the ugliness ever happened."
"LORELAI: Well, at least we have a tradition."
"LUKE: Good. I'll be right back. That's our table over there."
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk. Oh my God!"
"RORY: What happened?"
"KIRK: I'm scratched over sixty percent of my body."
"LORELAI: Aw, CatKirk again?"
"KIRK: Ow."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"BABETTE: I'm so mad at that cat."
"MOREY: Very uncool cat."
"BABETTE: I love cats, but I love Kirk, too. It's pretty much fifty-fifty, and that's a high compliment, my friend."
"LORELAI: How did this happen?"
"KIRK: Well, the tension of our standoff was unbearable, so I got on the floor and tried to play with him."
"LORELAI: It's a him?"
"KIRK: I caught a peek."
"LORELAI: Go on."
"KIRK: I rolled this cute little ball of yarn over to him all nice and gentle. He tried to garrote me with it."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"MOREY: Very uncool."
"KIRK: Just grabbed two ends with his paws and came at me."
"RORY: But he doesn't have opposable thumbs."
"KIRK: He's beyond them. And he's smart. He knows things, sometimes before they happen."
"LORELAI: Get a hold of yourself, man."
"KIRK: You haven't heard the worst."
"RORY: Oh geez, there's worse?"
"KIRK: When the attacks got particularly brutal, I had no choice but to strip naked and hide under water in the bathtub. I read that cats are afraid of water."
"BABETTE: They are, they are."
"KIRK: Kirk isn't. He found me, and he seemed to derive greater power from the water. That's when the bulk of the scratching happened."
"LORELAI: Well, then, I think it's good you're giving Kirk a little space right now. Just relax and enjoy your food."
"KIRK: I can't taste my food."
"LORELAI: Well, then, just try to relax."
"KIRK: Thanks."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk over to their table; Jess walks over]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey. [they kiss]"
"JESS: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi, Happy Thanksgiving. So, are you joining us?"
"JESS: Uh, sure, if that's okay."
"LORELAI: Yeah, sit, sit."
"[Luke and Caesar bring the plates over]"
"JESS: God, I'm starved."
"LUKE: You could've eaten."
"JESS: You kept telling me not to eat."
"LUKE: I did not."
"JESS: You did, too. You said you were waiting for them."
"LORELAI: Aw, you didn't have to wait for us."
"LUKE: I wasn't waiting for you, it just worked out this way."
"JESS: Right."
"RORY: Looks great."
"LORELAI: Tasty."
"LUKE: Shouldn't we give thanks first?"
"JESS: Thanks for what?"
"LUKE: Well, that we're not Native Americans who got their land stolen in exchange for smallpox infested blankets."
"LORELAI: Amen."
"LUKE: So where you guys in your day?"
"RORY: We hit the Kim's, we hit Sookie's, and we go to the grandparents from here."
"LORELAI: Full day."
"LUKE: Yeah. Well, you can skip eating this one if you want. Just have cokes or something, it's no big deal."
"LORELAI: No, no way, you're the main event today, my friend."
"LUKE: Oh, good."
"RORY: What's good are the yams."
"LORELAI: Definitely. Got some more marshmallows?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I can grab some. Hey, refill some coffees. [Luke and Jess walk away]"
"LORELAI: So, no offense, but lame-o kiss."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You and Jess, like a couple chickens pecking at each other."
"RORY: Mind your own business."
"LORELAI: Well, it was right in front of me."
"RORY: So, I don't need a review."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: I'm just not good with the public displays."
"LORELAI: You didn't have that problem with Dean."
"RORY: I know, but now I just feel like everybody's watching me."
"LORELAI: People are not watching you."
"RORY: You were watching me."
"LORELAI: I created you. It's biologically predetermined that I watch you."
"RORY: I just don't know how this whole second boyfriend thing is supposed to go."
"LORELAI: Well, he's your first second boyfriend. Give it time."
"RORY: The whole town got used to me with Dean, it's just weird."
"LORELAI: It'll get easier. You're gonna have hundreds of men in your life."
"RORY: Gee, thanks."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe not hundreds, but a couple, three, more. It'll get easier."
"RORY: I guess."
"LORELAI: Honey, they'll adjust to seeing you with Jess."
"RORY: And then there's Dean. What do I do about him?"
"LORELAI: Well, you know, he'll be moving on, too."
"RORY: Oh, right, of course he will, yeah."
"BABETTE: Well, we're outta here."
"MOREY: Time to walk some of this off."
"BABETTE: Oh, we'd have to walk to China to walk all of it off. Which way's China?"
"LORELAI: Thataway. Have a good night."
"BABETTE: Thanks. By the way, that was some half-assed kiss you two had. You gotta give it a little something, honey."
"LORELAI: Bye Babette. Bye Morey."
"BABETTE: Bye."
"RORY: The whole town is watching."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the front door]"
"RORY: You ready for this?"
"LORELAI: Of course."
"RORY: Even with the Cold w*r?"
"LORELAI: That's been going on for thirty-four years? I can manage."
"RORY: It's been a bit colder these past few weeks."
"LORELAI: Oh no, I'm fine, you know why? Because in two hours  and I do plan on extricating us from here in exactly two hours  the night will be over and I won't have to see them again until next year. Oh, start your stopwatch."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"EMILY: Hello."
"RORY: Hi Grandma. Happy Thanksgiving."
"EMILY: Thank you, Rory. Happy Thanksgiving, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Happy Thanksgiving. [mumbles to Rory] One hour, fifty-nine minutes, and forty seconds."
"[they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, it's a piano player."
"EMILY: That's Brad. I found him at Nordstrom's."
"LORELAI: Was he on sale?"
"EMILY: I thought a little background music would add a nice touch. He knows every song ever written."
"LORELAI: Free Bird! Hi Brad."
"EMILY: Lorelai, please. Now come along, everyone's here. [they walk to living room] We're all here."
"RICHARD: Oh, good. Happy Thanksgiving, Rory."
"RORY: Happy Thanksgiving, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Dad."
"RICHARD: These are our guests, Natalie and Douglas Swope."
"EMILY: You two have met."
"LORELAI: Yes, at the auction."
"NATALIE: Good to see you again."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"DOUGLAS: Nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Yes, you, too."
"RORY: Same here."
"RICHARD: And this is our international contingent, Claude and Monique Clemenceau. They're just in from France."
"LORELAI: Ah, Clemenceau, huh, I'd have guessed Spain."
"CLAUDE: Hello, how are you? [kisses Lorelai's hand]"
"LORELAI: Oh, ooh."
"MONIQUE: Hello."
"RICHARD: Monique, voici ma fille et ma petite fille."
"MONIQUE: Ah. Elle sont si jolies."
"CLAUDE: My Monique speaks only French, so please excuse the inconvenience."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, that's fine. I love French."
"CLAUDE: She really wants to learn English, perhaps tonight will inspire her. [to Monique] Je leur ai dit que tu voulais à prendre l'anglais."
"MONIQUE: L'anglais, oui, je veux à prendre, mais je suis tellement parasseuse."
"RICHARD: Ah, ça prends de temps, Monique. Ah, t'en fais pas."
"MONIQUE: Merci."
"RICHARD: Oh, no no no. That's why I love it when the Clemenceaus visit. It gives me the opportunity to haul out my rusty French."
"CLAUDE: Your French is wonderful, Richard. It always has been."
"RICHARD: Aw, non, tu es tres gentil. Please, sit, sit, sit."
"CLAUDE: Merci. So, Rory, you speak French at all?"
"RORY: Just a tiny little bit."
"CLAUDE: Un tout petite peu?"
"RORY: Oui, un tout petite peu."
"CLAUDE: And you, my dear?"
"LORELAI: Even less. Uh, voulez vous couchez avec moi ce soir? That's about it."
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: It's just a joke."
"RICHARD: Asking my friend to go to bed with you is a joke?"
"RORY: It's a song."
"LORELAI: It's just a joke, Dad."
"CLAUDE: Oh, voici c'est un chanson du pop. It's a pop song, ah, Monique. . . I did not know that."
"MONIQUE: Lady Marmalade."
"CLAUDE: It's very rich. It's very, very funny."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, thank you."
"CLAUDE: You need a drink, oui?"
"LORELAI: Very astute, Claude. Martini with a twist, Dad."
"RICHARD: All right."
"DOUGLAS: Is this your first American Thanksgiving, Claude?"
"CLAUDE: It is, it is. I've seen it in the movies. People seem to eat and eat and eat until they can't eat anymore."
"LORELAI: That's about it."
"NATALIE: It's about giving thanks, gets you thinking about the good things."
"DOUGLAS: We have a lot to give thanks for in this country."
"EMILY: Definitely."
"CLAUDE: Me, I start each day giving thanks for three things  Cuban cigars, French champagne, and gorgeous women. And I must give extra thanks for the extraordinary group here tonight."
"LORELAI: Douglas, Richard, leave us, won't you?"
"RICHARD: What?"
"EMILY: Just another joke."
"CLAUDE: Oh, I missed another joke?"
"NATALIE: You have your mother's wit."
"EMILY: Sometimes I wish she'd give it back."
"DOUGLAS: Emily mentioned that you were coming from another function?"
"CLAUDE: No, this is your second dinner?"
"RORY: Fourth, actually."
"NATALIE: Fourth?"
"RICHARD: Oh, thank you for fitting us in, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Don't worry, Dad. You're the main event. [to Rory] An hour and fifty six minutes."
"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[Everyone is seated at the table]"
"NATALIE: Beautiful table, Emily. You've outdone yourself yet again."
"EMILY: Oh, it's nothing."
"RICHARD: Well, is everyone settled? Is everyone comfy?"
"EVERYONE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes, Dad, we're fine."
"RICHARD: Well, then, let's get going."
"[Emily rings a bell, the maids bring out the turkey]"
"NATALIE: Gorgeous."
"DOUGLAS: Oh, wonderful."
"CLAUDE: Is it for us or the whole neighborhood?"
"NATALIE: Very nice."
"[Richard carves a piece off, then the maids start to take the turkey away]"
"LORELAI: Oh, ho, who gets the big piece?"
"RICHARD: I'm sorry?"
"LORELAI: Aren't you supposed to keep carving?"
"RICHARD: That was strictly ceremonial."
"LORELAI: Ceremonial?"
"EMILY: Ceremonial."
"CLAUDE: Cérémonial."
"MONIQUE: Cérémonial."
"EMILY: Please, start on the salads everyone."
"LORELAI: Is there anything ceremonial about the salads? Do we carve a crouton, then have them taken away?"
"EMILY: No, no ceremony."
"RORY: Salad's great, Grandma."
"EMILY: I'm surprised you can eat at this point, even salad."
"RORY: There's still room."
"LORELAI: And if there isn't room, we'll add on. I know a good contractor."
"CLAUDE: She's like your Jerry Lewis. She's very, very funny."
"NATALIE: Rory, did your grandmother say you were a high school senior?"
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"NATALIE: So you're going through this horrible period of applying to college."
"RORY: It's not so horrible."
"RICHARD: She's got it pretty well covered."
"LORELAI: That's right."
"NATALIE: All your applications are in?"
"RORY: I've applied."
"DOUGLAS: We have a grandson your age, he's going through hell."
"NATALIE: He's already been turned down for early admission to Stanford, his dream."
"DOUGLAS: Took it pretty hard."
"NATALIE: Children put so much stress on themselves these days."
"RORY: It's pretty stressful."
"NATALIE: He's waiting to hear from his backups."
"CLAUDE: I have a grandson who lives with his mother in Orlando, you know, he's going through a very similar thing, poor boy."
"EMILY: How do they like Orlando, Claude?"
"CLAUDE: Well, it's all Mickey Mouse this and Mickey Mouse that, you know. They want to die."
"EMILY: That's too bad."
"NATALIE: Where did you apply, dear?"
"RORY: Harvard."
"DOUGLAS: No word yet?"
"RORY: I'm not supposed to hear back for awhile."
"DOUGLAS: Where else?"
"RORY: Where else?"
"DOUGLAS: Where else did you apply? Your alternates?"
"NATALIE: We're so curious, it's like we've been going through this ourselves."
"RORY: Well, I'm pretty much counting on Harvard."
"DOUGLAS: Well, you didn't apply to just Harvard, did you?"
"RORY: Well, no."
"LORELAI: No?"
"NATALIE: Am I prying?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: We applied elsewhere?"
"DOUGLAS: You can't just apply to one place."
"NATALIE: Chilton wouldn't allow that."
"LORELAI: Is that true?"
"RORY: Pretty much."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you tell me that?"
"RORY: I was going to."
"NATALIE: You have to be safe."
"CLAUDE: My grandson  six schools."
"DOUGLAS: Same with Dustin."
"LORELAI: Where else did you apply?"
"RORY: Just at some other schools."
"DOUGLAS: Well, if you're aiming at Harvard, that would be Princeton, Yale, maybe Vassar, Wesleyan."
"CLAUDE: Certainly Yale because of Richard's connections, yes?"
"NATALIE: I would assume so."
"RORY: Those are the kinds of places, yup."
"LORELAI: The kinds of places or the places? Rory?"
"RORY: Princeton. . . um, Yale."
"LORELAI: Yale?"
"RICHARD: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Yale, Dad?"
"RICHARD: Oh, this is the first I'm hearing about it, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, bull."
"RORY: Mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You did this."
"RICHARD: I haven't discussed this awful subject since the debacle at the campus."
"LORELAI: You forced her hand."
"RICHARD: I did nothing of the sort."
"RORY: Mom, wait."
"LORELAI: You made it seem like you'd be deeply hurt if she didn't apply to Yale, and she's very sensitive, so that's as good as forcing her hand."
"EMILY: Lorelai, really."
"LORELAI: You wanted her to go to Yale instead of Harvard, didn't you?"
"RICHARD: Well, that wasn't a secret."
"CLAUDE: Lorelai ne veut pas que Rory aille à Yale."
"RICHARD: Je suis désolé de ce qui ce passe ici."
"LORELAI: Stick to English, Dad."
"RORY: Grandpa didn't force my hand."
"LORELAI: Honey, you weren't aware he was doing it."
"RICHARD: She is not a puppet, Lorelai."
"RORY: I needed a backup."
"LORELAI: But why Yale?"
"RORY: I could live at home."
"LORELAI: You."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, you got to her. That was your thing."
"NATALIE: I'm afraid we started this."
"EMILY: This is not your doing, Natalie."
"RICHARD: Encore une fois, je suis désolé."
"EMILY: I never spoke to Rory about that."
"LORELAI: I don't believe you."
"RORY: I figured it out on my own, Mom."
"LORELAI: You're saying there have been no conversations, no emails?"
"RORY: I can read a map."
"LORELAI: This is unbelievable."
"RICHARD: And past indelicate. We have guests."
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm sorry, I apologize, I'm sorry you have to see this."
"EMILY: This is paranoia, Lorelai. There's been no conspiring."
"LORELAI: I'm not being paranoid, Mom. For seventeen years, she was going to Harvard, and now all of a sudden, she's applied to Yale and she's mimicking everything you say. This is just crazy. [leaves the room]"
"CLAUDE: Elle a dit que, c'est de la folie.'"
"EMILY: Excuse me, please."
"CUT TO BACK PATIO"
"[Lorelai is standing outside as Emily walks out the back door]"
"EMILY: It's freezing out here."
"LORELAI: It's Jamaica compared to in there."
"EMILY: It's just an alternative to Harvard, a backup. It changes nothing."
"LORELAI: No, no."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, I don't wanna talk."
"EMILY: Do you believe we had nothing to do with this?"
"LORELAI: Just for a second, Mom, please. Just let me digest this for a second. All this Yale stuff. . .agh!"
"EMILY: You can't even let Rory have one piece of our lives, even if it's her choice. You hate us that much."
"[Lorelai doesn't respond. Emily walks back into the house]"
"CUT TO THE KIM'S HOUSE"
"[The last of the guests are leaving]"
"MRS. KIM: Goodbye, drive safe."
"GUEST: Thank you. [leaves]"
"LANE: Excellent Thanksgiving, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: I think people had fun."
"LANE: And it was nice of you to only charge half price on the chair that Yung Hee broke."
"MRS. KIM: That was my cost."
"LANE: That why it was nice."
"DAVE: Well, I guess I'll be going."
"MRS. KIM: All right. You did a good job. Thank you for your time, David."
"DAVE: Oh, you're welcome, Mrs. Kim. I enjoyed it."
"LANE: Yes, thank you."
"DAVE: You're welcome."
"MRS. KIM: Here. Some rice, spinach, lots of tofurkey."
"DAVE: Great, thanks."
"MRS. KIM: And something for your time."
"DAVE: That's very nice, thank you. Happy Thanksgiving."
"MRS. KIM: Goodbye."
"[Dave leaves]"
"MRS. KIM: Keep clearing. I'm going to start on the kitchen."
"LANE: Okay. Oh, Mama, look. Dave's bible. He forgot it. He's gonna need this, too. I'll run it out to him."
"MRS. KIM: Wait."
"LANE: We're gonna miss him."
"MRS. KIM: Let me see that. [takes the bible and reads the inside cover] This bible belongs to God, but is being used by Dave Rygalski.' [hands the bible back to Lane] Go on."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lane rushes down the sidewalk; Dave is waiting by a tree]"
"DAVE: Wow, you run really quiet."
"LANE: Sorry, I'm sorry about everything."
"DAVE: What?"
"LANE: The whole night. I had no idea she'd make you play five straight hours without a break."
"DAVE: It's okay."
"LANE: Your hands must be dead."
"DAVE: They're just a little numb. But I've got these Kurt Cobain calluses now, how cool is that?"
"LANE: But this whole thing, this whole charade, the fake flier and everything, it was too much."
"DAVE: Lane, it's fine. And that flier  I've gotten like three other calls for paying gigs. I should be paying you a commission."
"LANE: Oh, that's not necessary."
"DAVE: And check it out  twenty bucks."
"LANE: Wow, she liked you."
"DAVE: We'll put it towards our first real date."
"LANE: Really? After all this  the marathon hymns, the weak punch, the crabby Koreans, you still wanna go out on a date with me?"
"[Dave nods, then kisses her]"
"DAVE: I've gotta go. . . but I'm gonna call you tomorrow."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street]"
"RORY: Are you mad?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not mad."
"RORY: You seem mad."
"LORELAI: I'm not mad."
"RORY: What are you feeling?"
"LORELAI: I wouldn't know how to word it."
"RORY: Try."
"LORELAI: See, my head knows that whichever one of these places you go, Harvard, Princeton, Yale. . .it's gonna be great. It's gonna be awesome, and you're gonna come out on the other side an even more amazing you. But I just wish my head could sit down and have a chat with that gnawing feeling in my gut that's there every time my parents get involved in anything and tell it, it's gonna be okay."
"RORY: It's gonna be okay."
"LORELAI: Nice try."
"[They walk across Sookie's front yard]"
"JACKSON: What else are we putting in the pot? Come on, let's think of something. Uh, a raspberry, a deep-fried raspberry. How bout a rasquat?"
"GUY: Cake!"
"JACKSON: Cake! Deep-fried cake!"
"GUY: Dibs on the deep-fried cake!"
"JACKSON: You haven't even eaten your deep-fried biscotti."
"[Lorelai and Rory sit down at the picnic table with Sookie]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Ah, hi there."
"LORELAI: Are you okay?"
"SOOKIE: This tastes good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it looks like they're deep-frying "
"SOOKIE: Everything."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"SOOKIE: Vegetables, mashed potatoes, butter, pickles, salt, a napkin."
"RORY: And yet, you're very serene."
"LORELAI: Uh, you're practically floating."
"SOOKIE: Well, you caught me at a good time, ladies. I've already gone through the five stages of grieving. Denial, anger. . .I don't remember these two, but they were served on the rocks with salt! Now, I'm just happily enscotched in acceptance. Enscotched. . ."
"RORY: Ensconced?"
"SOOKIE: Ensconced  that's it! I do believe I heard Phil suggest throwing Junior in."
"LORELAI: Junior?"
"SOOKIE: His nephew."
"LORELAI: Whoa."
"SOOKIE: I chimed in on that one."
"LORELAI: What happened over there?"
"SOOKIE: Mm, about a half-hour ago they set the lawn on fire."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"SOOKIE: But Phil says it's okay and everything cause it'll grow back twice as lush. Though that's what he said when he broke my salad bowl that I brought back from Belgium. That'll maybe grow back, too, huh? [laughs] Phil is a riot. Am I crying or laughing?"
"LORELAI: Laughing."
"SOOKIE: Good."
"[Rory's pager goes off]"
"LORELAI: Who's that?"
"RORY: It's Lane. It just says bible kiss bible'."
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: I have no idea. Good band name, though."
"LORELAI: Honey, we should get going? You gonna be okay?"
"SOOKIE: I'm Sookie."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but you're gonna be okay, right? You'll go to bed soon."
"SOOKIE: Unless they deep-fried it."
"LORELAI: I'm sure they haven't. Okay, we'll see you tomorrow."
"[Lorelai and Rory start walking away]"
"RORY: Poor thing."
"LORELAI: Oh, she may not remember any of it."
"JACKSON: Deep-fried shoe!"
"GUY: Deep-fried shoe!"
"[Everyone cheers]"
"CUT TO FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke and Jess walk out of the diner; Jess is carrying a garbage bag]"
"JESS: Get more trash cans."
"LUKE: I don't need more."
"JESS: You make me run around town for a place to dump this."
"LUKE: Just dump it in one of Taylor's bins. It gets it out of here and it'll drive Taylor crazy. It's a win-win."
"LORELAI: Hi guys."
"LUKE: We're out of food."
"LORELAI: Oh, please, we're not eating for a year."
"RORY: Or til tomorrow morning."
"LORELAI: Whichever comes first. Hi Saint Nick."
"JESS: Tell him he needs to get more trash cans."
"LUKE: Just go."
"LORELAI: You got any coffee?"
"LUKE: That I've got. Come on in. Hey, did I see flames coming from Sookie's place about a half-hour ago?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, why?"
"[Lorelai and Luke walk into the diner. Rory follows Jess down the sidewalk]"
"JESS: I still say you should get more tra. . ."
"[Rory kisses him]"
"RORY: Hi."
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Later."
"[Rory walks away. As Jess carries the trash bag down the street, he finds Dean standing on the sidewalk]"
"DEAN: Nothing to say?"
"JESS: Guess not."
"DEAN: That's funny, you usually have something to say."
"JESS: Guess I'm all talked out."
"DEAN: What's the matter, Jess? Why you walking away?"
"JESS: It's getting a little West Side Story here, Dean, and I gotta warn you, my dancing k*ll are not up to snuff."
"DEAN: But now's your chance, there's no one else around."
"JESS: Go home. Cool off."
"DEAN: Come on, make one of your Boy Scout references, or a good Farmer John joke. I got my Doose's Market apron with me  you want me to put it on, give you a little inspiration? I don't get it, what happened  you suddenly like me now?"
"JESS: Oh yeah, I was just about to invite you camping."
"DEAN: Good, okay, now we're getting somewhere."
"JESS: I'm not gonna fight you, Dean."
"DEAN: Why?"
"JESS: Cause if I fight you, Rory's gonna think it's my fault, so just forget it, okay? Just forget it. Go home. Let it rest."
"DEAN: So Rory's got a nice little hold on you now, huh?"
"JESS: Geez. Don't do that."
"DEAN: How does it feel?"
"JESS: It feels like I'm with Rory and you're not."
"DEAN: You know, when all this happened with you and me and Rory, I figured I'd just stay out of everyone's way, that that would be easiest. But now, I'm looking at you and I'm thinking, I'm gonna run from him? The Glad Man. This is my town, I'm not hiding. And I don't have be remotely calm around you anymore, and I like that feeling. I like it a lot. Happy Thanksgiving, Jess."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter]"
"LUKE: So, how did the four dinners work out? You guys must feel more stuffed than you've ever been."
"LORELAI: I don't know. Is this more stuffed than the great Six Flags hot dog consumption of 99?"
"RORY: No, or the taffy binge of '97."
"LORELAI: Not by a long sh*t. See, we didn't eat at my parents because of the upset, so we really had three dinners, not four."
"RORY: Which means. . ."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: We didn't have to skip rolls."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. Hey, do you have any rolls left?"
"LUKE: No. Come on."
"LORELAI: Just a little something for the walk home."
"[Luke hands her a bag of rolls]"
"LUKE: I don't see how you do it."
"LORELAI: Well, you're not us, are ya? Night Luke."
"RORY: Night Luke."
"LUKE: Night."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk past the gazebo]"
"LORELAI: This has been a nice Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Very."
"LORELAI: Nicer for some than others though."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Night Kirk!"
"[Kirk is trying to go to sleep on a bench in the gazebo]"
"KIRK: Night."

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Lane are walking through the center of town]"
"LANE: Are you serious?"
"LORELAI: I am serious."
"LANE: We can really rehearse in your garage?"
"LORELAI: In exchange for the promise that you never pose naked on the cover of Rolling Stone no matter how much trouble your career is in."
"LANE: I promise. I love you. Do you know how amazing your mother is?"
"LORELAI: No. Tell her, would ya? She forgot this morning."
"RORY: Because hot water is enjoyed by all, not just by you."
"LORELAI: I wasn't in the shower that long."
"RORY: Man, it's winter carnival time again already."
"LANE: Yup."
"RORY: Are you going?"
"LANE: I have to. We are raising money for the marching band this year, mandatory booth manning is involved."
"LORELAI: Man, Lane  marching band, rock band."
"LANE: Music is my life."
"LORELAI: Hi Mrs. Kim!"
"LANE: So not funny."
"RORY: Raising money for the marching band to do what?"
"LORELAI: Please let it be new uniforms."
"LANE: It's for letters so we can finally have letter carriers. For some reason, the powers that be think that the reason we never win at competitions is because no one knows who we are. The fact that we suck has never occurred to them. What's wrong with our uniforms?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"LANE: We look stupid, right?"
"LORELAI: No."
"LANE: The plumes are too big, and it looks like big red fountains of blood spurting out of our heads."
"LORELAI: I love the uniforms."
"LANE: It's bad enough I have to be in marching band at all without being mocked for what is mandatory for us to wear."
"LORELAI: No, no, no, I didn't mean, I. . .remind her that she gets to rehearse in our garage cause I think I'm losing points here."
"RORY: Your uniforms are great, and people knowing who you are can only help. Now let's just enjoy the snow, okay?"
"LANE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Especially since some of us have been freezing since our showers this morning."
"LORELAI: I wasn't in there that long."
"LANE: I'm sorry, can we get back to the band uniforms, cause on a scale of one to ten, how much do I not wanna let Dave see me like that?"
"LORELAI/RORY: Ten."
"LANE: Okay, thanks."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"TEACHER: To evaluate the value of a function of X when X equals pi. You want to start by splitting the intregal into two separate intregals. Now, since the left intregal is a variable of a constant exponent, remember C is a constant, add one and divide by the new power."
"MADELINE: Paris, what did he say?"
"PARIS: Hm?"
"MADELINE: He's talking too fast, I missed it."
"PARIS: Ask Louise."
"MADELINE: Louise, what did he say?"
"LOUISE: I don't know, ask Paris."
"MADELINE: She told me to ask you."
"LOUISE: Why would she do that?"
"MADELINE: I don't know."
"LOUISE: Did you guys have a fight?"
"MADELINE: Not that I know of."
"TEACHER: . . . The right intregal, however, is more complex. You have to use U substitution with U equals 3 feet. [bell rings] We'll pick up at the same place tomorrow."
"RORY: The bell rang."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: The bell? That loud metal musical contraption that when hit loudly by a vibrating mallet signals the end of this particular educational experience."
"PARIS: Class is over?"
"RORY: Yup."
"PARIS: What did he talk about?"
"MADELINE: Ask Louise."
"PARIS: I didn't take notes. I didn't pay attention. I'm going to. . ."
"RORY: Borrow my notes and be just fine."
"PARIS: Thank you."
"MADELINE: Madeline want notes, too, please."
"LOUISE: Add one and divide by the new power? Oh, I thought it said add one and divide by the Jew power. It makes much more sense this way."
"PARIS: I can't believe I zoned out for the entire class."
"RORY: You must have a lot on your mind."
"PARIS: I do."
"RORY: I'm sure. Okay, so, onto the next thing. I don't think I'll have the prom bids ready for the supplemental student council meeting this week."
"PARIS: Oh."
"RORY: They need a little more time to get the details together, so that leaves a little hole in our agenda. Any thoughts?"
"PARIS: Well, we can just cancel the supplementary meeting this week."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Well, if there's nothing really to talk about, what's the point, right?"
"LOUISE: You said that one student council meeting a week was not enough."
"MADELINE: Yeah, you said that was no way to govern, that meeting once a week was lazy, ineffectual, and if we were going to do it like that, we might as well just buy ourselves a ranch in Texas."
"PARIS: Fine, if you guys wanna sit around for an hour after school swapping makeover horror stories, then count me in. Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I plucked outside of my designated brow line? Man, was my face red."
"MADELINE: I've done that, too. Ooh, it's bad."
"LOUISE: She was being sarcastic."
"MADELINE: Well, I wasn't. I looked surprised for a month."
"PARIS: We'll just take this week off, and next week we'll go back to twice a week, okay?"
"RORY: Sounds fair."
"LOUISE: Sounds fab."
"FRANCIE: I heard something about the supplemental student council meeting  anything I need to know about, a new chart to be made, perhaps?"
"PARIS: No. We were just saying that the agenda seems light this week, so I've decided to cancel it, and we can just gather at the regular meeting on Friday."
"FRANCIE: Wow, this is quite a change in plans."
"PARIS: You have a problem with it?"
"FRANCIE: No, I'm just surprised. You seem so attached to those meetings."
"PARIS: Well, I finally got a blankie. It's much better."
"FRANCIE: Okay, no extra meeting this week. What will I do with all that extra time? Well, I guess I'll think of something."
"PARIS: Take a picture of which outfit wins, will ya?"
"RORY: Bye Francie."
"FRANCIE: Bye."
"[Rory and Paris walk into the hallway]"
"PARIS: I met his parents."
"RORY: You did?"
"PARIS: He bought me a ticket, and I took the train to Philadelphia, and he met me at the station, and I spent Christmas with him and his family."
"RORY: Sounds nice."
"PARIS: No, not nice. It was perfect. They had a Christmas tree twelve feet tall. Everything was red and silver and there was eggnog. Have you ever had eggnog?"
"RORY: Yes, I have."
"PARIS: It's disgusting."
"RORY: Yes, it is."
"PARIS: But disgusting in a really great way. And they had tiny wreaths hanging from every doorknob, and mistletoe and candles everywhere. I couldn't believe it. I mean, I've never had a Christmas before. One year, I asked my mother if we could get a Chanukah bush. She made me watch Shoah the rest of the week."
"RORY: Wow."
"PARIS: The place smelled like cinnamon all the time, and there was a fire in the fireplace, and a ton of presents. I mean, hundreds of presents. I'm looking at this mound of gifts, and I'm thinking, Eight days of Chanukah. . . who was the skinflint who thought up that deal?'"
"RORY: Don't the eight days symbolize something?"
"PARIS: Yes, they symbolize eight days of ripping off the little kids who can't have a Chanukah bush."
"RORY: You're making me sad."
"PARIS: His mother bought me a present."
"RORY: Well, that says something."
"PARIS: What does it say?"
"RORY: It says that Jamie likes you enough that she felt compelled to buy you a present."
"PARIS: I had the most amazing time. Sitting around the tree opening presents, and they played Christmas music and we drank apple cider. . .it was so nice. And then his grandfather and I wound up in a theological discussion. Jesus  Messiah or nice Jewish kid with a hammer? It got pretty heated."
"RORY: Okay, skip to the end, I can't take it. How did it turn out?"
"PARIS: He told me he loved me."
"RORY: Aw, Paris!"
"PARIS: I never thought I'd hear a boy tell me he loved me."
"RORY: That's great."
"PARIS: He invited me back up for Easter break."
"RORY: You're going, I assume?"
"PARIS: Are you kidding? And miss a chance to debate Christ rising from the dead? I'm so there."
"RORY: Jamie's a lucky man."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks through the dining room as Michel speaks Hungarian to a group of guests. The guests get angry, and Michel runs out of the room]"
"MICHEL: Move, please."
"LORELAI: Whoa, what's going on?"
"MICHEL: I cannot talk now, please."
"LORELAI: Michel, they sound really angry."
"MICHEL: They do, don't they?"
"LORELAI: What did you say?"
"MICHEL: I don't know."
"LORELAI: What do you mean you don't know? All you had to say was Welcome to Stars Hollow,' that's it."
"MICHEL: I know, I thought I did, and then they got angry and threw breadsticks and butter pats."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: I'm looking. [flips through a dictionary]"
"LORELAI: You only had to say one word in Hungarian  welcome, that's it. How bad could it be?"
"MICHEL: Very bad."
"LORELAI: Oh, Michel."
"MICHEL: Very, very bad."
"LORELAI: Be careful."
"[Michel walks back to the guests as the phone rings. Lorelai answers]"
"LORELAI: Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"EMILY: Well, your father's sixtieth birthday dinner is back on."
"LORELAI: What sixtieth birthday dinner?"
"EMILY: The one that I had planned for Wednesday night."
"LORELAI: Oh, were we coming?"
"EMILY: Of course you were coming. You think you wouldn't be invited?"
"LORELAI: Well, apparently, we weren't invited."
"EMILY: I had just started planning the whole thing when he came home in a mood and declared that parties were for children and it was canceled."
"LORELAI: Were we disappointed?"
"EMILY: However, today he came in and changed his mind, so I expect the two of you at eight. And bring a gift, but don't get him a cigar humidor."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: I bought him a cigar humidor."
"LORELAI: I assumed."
"EMILY: It's gorgeous. It belonged to a lieutenant in the army in World w*r I. Apparently, he kept it in his field office in France. There are carvings in the bottom that the dealer said could possibly be coded messages."
"LORELAI: Cool."
"EMILY: I think so, too. All right, eight o'clock, do not be late."
"LORELAI: Okay, we will not be late. Bye. [hangs up the phone as Michel walks back to the desk] Well?"
"MICHEL: It's fine. All we have to do is pay the ransom and they will give us the busboy back."
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, uh. . ."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen and starts screaming. She traps a spider under a cup on the floor. There's a knock at the back door.]"
"LORELAI: Come in. [Dean walks in] Dean, hi."
"DEAN: Hi. Uh, I hope I'm not disturbing anything."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, absolutely not."
"DEAN: Good. Um, I just wanted to. . ."
"LORELAI: Ah, ah!"
"DEAN: What?"
"LORELAI: Don't kick the cup."
"DEAN: The what?"
"LORELAI: I have a spider whose previous credits include the bathtub scene from Annie Hall trapped under that cup."
"DEAN: The size of a Buick?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"DEAN: I see. And what are you planning to do now that you've got him trapped?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was thinking of just giving him the kitchen."
"DEAN: Okay."
"LORELAI: Cause, you know, we don't use it very much anyhow, so, uh. . ."
"DEAN: I could get rid of it if you want."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that'd be great. Just, careful . . . He heard me talking, so don't let him get away. He knows I'm behind this, he'll come after me. Ugh, ugh, ugh. I guess you can see why camping's completely out of the question for me."
"DEAN: Got it."
"LORELAI: Okay, great. Could ya. . .uh. . .[gestures to the back door]"
"DEAN: Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem."
"LORELAI: Don't let his family see you. Spiders are vindictive."
"[Dean takes the spider out the back door]"
"RORY: [calls from front hall] Mom?"
"LORELAI: Uh, Rory."
"[Rory walks into the kitchen]"
"RORY: Can we do pizza tonight? I've got a ton of studying to do."
"LORELAI: Sure, pizza sounds great."
"RORY: Good. Why's the door open?"
"LORELAI: The door is open because. . .Dean's here."
"[Dean walks in]"
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: Hi."
"LORELAI: Um, Dean threw out a spider for me."
"DEAN: I just came by to drop off some of your stuff."
"RORY: Oh."
"DEAN: Just some books you loaned me, a couple of CD's."
"RORY: Okay, thanks."
"DEAN: Yeah, sure. Okay, so, I'm gonna go."
"LORELAI: Thanks Dean."
"[Dean leaves]"
"LORELAI: It was a really big spider. I think it had a g*n. What are you feeling right now?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: Not weirded out, even a little?"
"RORY: Why would I be weirded out?"
"LORELAI: Well, Dean coming over, bringing your stuff back."
"RORY: No, I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. Although, you know, if you were weirded out a little, it would be okay. It wouldn't mean that you don't like Jess, or that you made a mistake. It would just mean the guy who was in your life for two years isn't there anymore."
"RORY: I was just surprised, that's all."
"LORELAI: If you say so."
"RORY: I do."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: I'm gonna go start studying."
"LORELAI: I'll order the pizza."
"RORY: Thank you."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Jess are walking through the town square]"
"RORY: You know what just occurred to me? That we are very fortunate to have good teeth."
"JESS: Yes, very fortunate."
"RORY: Can you imagine if braces were involved in this interaction?"
"JESS: It'd be a bloodbath."
"RORY: I can't catch my breath."
"JESS: You're not supposed to."
"RORY: Hey, listen, Thursday night is the Stars Hollow High Winter Carnival."
"JESS: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Yeah, I thought we could go, meet Lane there."
"JESS: Nope."
"RORY: But it'd be really fun. They'll have really bad games and really bad food and the marching band will play and "
"JESS: Rory, I'm doing some of my best work here and you're just talking right through it."
"RORY: Come on, let's go to the carnival."
"JESS: I don't go to these stupid town things."
"RORY: You went to the Bid-A-Basket festival. You went to the dance marathon."
"JESS: That was when I was trying to get you. I now have you. That means I don't have to go anymore."
"RORY: You're serious?"
"JESS: As a heart attack."
"RORY: But it'll be fun."
"JESS: We can have our own fun."
"RORY: I can't miss the winter carnival."
"JESS: Rory, come on."
"RORY: Well, I never have. I can't. Just go with me, please."
"JESS: Look, how bout you go to the festival, meet Lane, and then I'll hook up with you afterwards."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: That's my final offer, man."
"RORY: Fine."
"JESS: Fine."
"RORY: We're gonna walk right in front of a car one of these days."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory and Jess walk in]"
"JESS: So, you want some help with your homework?"
"RORY: You're going to help me?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: Don't take this the wrong way, but how?"
"JESS: Come upstairs and I'll show you."
"RORY: Upstairs?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: Well, you know how important my education is to me."
"JESS: Yes, I do."
"[Lorelai walks in with some shopping bags]"
"LORELAI: Rory, hey. Thank God, I need help. Where you going?"
"RORY: Nowhere."
"JESS: See ya. [goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Were you guys gonna go upstairs and kiss?"
"RORY: Wow, look at all the bags."
"LORELAI: Yes, I went shopping for my father's birthday present today, which was great for about fifteen minutes, until it all came back to me."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: The fact that I totally suck at buying my father presents."
"RORY: He'll like whatever you get him."
"LORELAI: If I slip him a quaalude, he'll like whatever I get him."
"RORY: They are not that bad."
"LORELAI: My intentions are always good, and I never put a price limit on it. I even went so far as to follow older men around the store who kind of looked like my dad to see what they were buying, which didn't help me with ideas, but I did get asked to the antique car show."
"RORY: Just show me what you got."
"LORELAI: Fine. Option number one  a state of the art, high tech, titanium bathroom scale."
"RORY: Huh."
"LORELAI: What? He has weight."
"RORY: Yes, but I'm not sure that his birthday is the time to remind him of it."
"LORELAI: Okay, option number two  a fabulous mechanical coin sorter. You put the coins in, it sorts them. What?"
"RORY: Well, it's a little generic."
"LORELAI: Generic in a good way, or. . ."
"RORY: What's the third option?"
"LORELAI: See, I should have pulled the coin sorter out last, cause. . ."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: A tie."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's silk."
"RORY: It's nice."
"LORELAI: It is?"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: It's a tie for my father's birthday."
"LUKE: What, no Aramis this year?"
"LORELAI: No, he likes ties."
"LUKE: You know, if you get the big bottle, it usually comes with a tote bag and a soap on a rope."
"LORELAI: Go away. My gifts suck."
"RORY: It's the thought that counts."
"LORELAI: What'd you get him?"
"RORY: Nothing big."
"LORELAI: Well, what?"
"RORY: Just a thing."
"LORELAI: What kind of thing?"
"RORY: Chuck Berry Live at the Fillmore on vinyl."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, that's perfect. He loves Chuck Berry. How did you come up with that?"
"RORY: I called him and asked him what he wanted."
"LORELAI: That's cheating."
"RORY: Tough."
"LORELAI: Well, now what am I gonna do? I can't give him a tie when you give him the world's most perfect present we already know he likes."
"RORY: You want me to go find something for you?"
"LORELAI: You would do that?"
"RORY: He gave me a couple other suggestions. I can go see if I can find one of them."
"LORELAI: Ugh, my God, I love you. You are my angel."
"RORY: Hey, you had one more that you didn't show me."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah  it lights up and sings."
"RORY: Enough said."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory is walking down the sidewalk. She stops to look in a store window, then accidentally bumps into Dean.]"
"RORY: Oh!"
"DEAN: Oh, sorry."
"RORY: I didn't see you."
"DEAN: I wasn't paying attention."
"RORY: I was just looking in the window and then. . ."
"DEAN: I was just noticing the new benches in the square."
"RORY: Sorry."
"DEAN: Yeah, uh, sorry."
"RORY: It's weird."
"DEAN: What's weird?"
"RORY: How we keep randomly bumping into each other like this."
"DEAN: Well, it wasn't exactly random bumping into you at your house."
"RORY: Right, I live there, not so random."
"DEAN: Though, this, right now. ."
"RORY: Random."
"DEAN: Very random."
"RORY: That's probably the most the word random's been used in a two minutes period in a really long time."
"DEAN: Hey, you wanna get a cup of coffee?"
"RORY: Coffee?"
"DEAN: Maybe talk a little? Of course, if you prefer, we can both just head over to Weston's and randomly bump into each other."
"RORY: No, uh, that's okay. I can get coffee."
"DEAN: Good."
"CUT TO WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Rory and Dean walk in]"
"DEAN: So, where do you wanna sit?"
"RORY: Um, there's good, if you like the window."
"DEAN: Window is fine."
"RORY: Of course, there's that one if you don't like the window."
"DEAN: Window's fine."
"RORY: The window can be colder because of the glass, but then that one is right by the bathroom, and being right by the bathroom always makes me kind of uncomfortable, which isn't really fair because something has to be right by the bathroom. Otherwise, you're cutting down on tables, which means you're cutting down on profits and. . .window's fine?"
"DEAN: Window's fine."
"RORY: Let's sit down then. [they sit down] This is a very nice table. Good pick."
"KIRK: Today we have an almond tort, an apple pandowdy, and various marzipan fruits made by a sect of cloistered nuns in Toledo."
"DEAN: I'll have a piece of pie."
"KIRK: Cherry, peach, chocolate, pumpkin, custard "
"DEAN: Custard's fine."
"KIRK: There's more."
"DEAN: I know, but custard's fine."
"KIRK: You don't wanna hear the rest?"
"DEAN: I am really good with the custard."
"KIRK: But they made memorize thirty different flavors."
"DEAN: Kirk?"
"KIRK: Yes?"
"DEAN: Custard is fine."
"KIRK: You want ice cream with that?"
"DEAN: Are there different flavors?"
"KIRK: Thirty-two."
"DEAN: Just the pie."
"KIRK: Okay. What about you?"
"RORY: Oh, nothing for me."
"DEAN: Nothing?"
"RORY: I'm not hungry."
"DEAN: You're not hungry?"
"RORY: Nope, I'm not."
"DEAN: She's not hungry."
"KIRK: I'll be right back."
"DEAN: In all the time I've known you, I've never seen you not hungry."
"RORY: Yeah, well. . ."
"DEAN: Thanks for doing this."
"RORY: Of course. Why wouldn't I?"
"DEAN: Because you're incredibly uncomfortable."
"RORY: Well, it's the situation, not you."
"DEAN: Yeah, the situation."
"RORY: You know, with you and me being. . ."
"DEAN: Yeah, yeah, I know the situation. So, um, how are ya?"
"RORY: I'm fine. You?"
"DEAN: I'm doing okay."
"RORY: How's school?"
"DEAN: Not bad. I've got McKellan for History."
"RORY: Oh, has he done his Napoleon having dinner with Charlemagne bit yet?"
"DEAN: Catherine the Great shows up for dessert."
"RORY: Oh, wow, he's revised it. Good for him. He's a unique man, but a decent teacher."
"DEAN: Yeah. You know, um, I wanted to tell you I applied to Southern Connecticut State."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: McKellan actually wrote me a letter of recommendation."
"RORY: Wait a minute  you do know that Southern Connecticut State is a four-year college?"
"DEAN: Yeah, I read that in the brochure."
"RORY: But what happened to I'm going to community college'?"
"DEAN: I changed my mind."
"RORY: Why?"
"DEAN: You."
"RORY: Me?"
"DEAN: All your Harvard talk, all those crazy books you pushed on me, all that talk about you can do more.'"
"RORY: You can do more."
"DEAN: So I decided to do more."
"RORY: Wow, I'm so glad."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"RORY: Well, if you need any help with anything, I've become the Rain Man of college application requirements."
"DEAN: Thanks. I might take you up on that."
"KIRK: Custard pie, no ice cream."
"DEAN: Thanks, Kirk."
"RORY: Wow. Southern Connecticut State, that's exciting. When did all this happen?"
"DEAN: The last few weeks. Uh, it's funny. I got the envelope, and I wanted to call you, and then I realized, uh, I can't do that."
"RORY: You could've done that."
"DEAN: I guess. I don't know, I can't get over how weird it is. I go from seeing you everyday to. . ."
"RORY: I know."
"DEAN: I mean, I'm used to talking to you."
"RORY: I know."
"DEAN: That's a hard thing to just let go of."
"RORY: For me, too."
"DEAN: I don't know, Rory. Maybe. . .maybe, um. . .is there a way we could be friends?"
"RORY: Really?"
"DEAN: If you want to."
"RORY: Oh, I want to. I really want to. But "
"DEAN: Don't ask me how I'm gonna deal with him. I have no idea."
"RORY: Okay."
"DEAN: Let's just take this one step at a time."
"RORY: Absolutely. Slow and steady wins the race."
"DEAN: This is really good. You sure you don't want a bite?"
"RORY: One bite. So how's Clara's horseback-riding lessons going?"
"DEAN: Not bad. I think she actually got within three feet of the thing last week."
"RORY: Hm, very impressive."
"DEAN: She thought so."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily and Richard are sitting in the living room for Richard's birthday party]"
"RICHARD: This man is a genius. Listen to him play."
"RORY: I'm glad you like it, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Oh, I must say, I am a very spoiled man. Chuck Berry, and the complete history of the Peloponnesian w*r."
"LORELAI: Well, sure, cause a partial history would skip all the dirty stuff."
"RICHARD: I especially like the way you wrapped the books in a bow tie. It's very, very clever."
"LORELAI: I thought it would be appropriate."
"EMILY: And, of course, you're not forgetting your favorite gift."
"RICHARD: Oh, yes, my beautiful humidor from my beautiful wife."
"EMILY: Thank you."
"RICHARD: No, thank you. It's been a wonderful birthday."
"[the doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: Would you like some more champagne?"
"RICHARD: Oh, why not?"
"TRIX: [from hallway] One of the porch lights is b*rned out. Perhaps the simple act of glancing outside a window once in awhile might have alerted someone to the situation."
"LORELAI: Gran?"
"RICHARD: Trix, is that you? Well, I'll be. What a surprise. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Mom, did you know Grandma was coming?"
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Okay, no seems like a safe answer."
"RICHARD: [from hallway] Emily, come here! Come say hello to this delightful creature that just walked in."
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Come on, let's see if she tries to make a break for it."
"[they all walk to the front hallway where Richard is standing with Trix]"
"RICHARD: Emily, did you know about this?"
"EMILY: Why, no, I didn't."
"RICHARD: Well, I'm floored."
"TRIX: Good. Hello Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hello Gran, good to see you."
"TRIX: You're well?"
"LORELAI: I'm well."
"TRIX: You're working?"
"LORELAI: I'm working."
"TRIX: You're single?"
"LORELAI: I'm single."
"TRIX: By choice, or do you scare the men with your independence?"
"LORELAI: Actually, I scare them with my Minnie Pearl impression."
"TRIX: The lady with the hat. Rory, as soon as I get settled, I want to hear all about your schooling and your college plans."
"RORY: Okay, Gran."
"TRIX: Well, Emily, I don't know if you realize it or not, but it's not proper to receive guests in the foyer. It puts one in the awkward position of having to invite oneself in."
"EMILY: Uh, yes, uh, please, I - I'm sorry. Please, come in."
"RICHARD: This way. [Richard leads her to the living room]"
"EMILY: What is she doing here?"
"LORELAI: She's visiting."
"EMILY: She didn't call, she always calls."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's Dad's birthday. She wanted it to be a surprise."
"EMILY: But I haven't prepared. I haven't shopped or set up the guest room and  oh God, her horrible gifts are still in the basement. What do I do?"
"LORELAI: Leave them there."
"EMILY: But "
"LORELAI: It's too late to do anything about that now. Come on."
"[they walk to the living room]"
"TRIX: Oh, Emily, you're still here."
"EMILY: Yes, of course I'm still here. Can I get you some champagne?"
"TRIX: Well, if you wish me to be violently ill tomorrow, absolutely."
"LORELAI: Do not answer that."
"RICHARD: I've got you covered Trix. Now, tell me what on earth you're doing here. You didn't travel all the way from England just for my birthday."
"TRIX: Oh, I think your birthday is a good enough reason to travel all the way from England. However, it did also happen to coincide with some business I needed to attend to."
"RORY: What kind of business?"
"TRIX: Well, for the past year, I've been renting my home in Hartford to a group of musicians. They've recently moved out, so I had to come check on the house and secure a new tenant."
"LORELAI: What kind of musicians?"
"TRIX: A rock and roll group of some sort. I believe they call themselves Korn."
"LORELAI: You rented your house to Korn?"
"RORY: That's so cool!"
"TRIX: They were fine tenants. Took wonderful care of the place. They planted some lovely tulips in the front yard."
"EMILY: So, Mom, if you're going to be here for awhile, I can plan some things for you to do, some outings you might enjoy."
"TRIX: Like what?"
"EMILY: Like the arboretum."
"TRIX: I have no desire to spend the entire day with plants, Emily. I'm not a bee. Besides, I already know what I would like to do. I would like to see where Lorelai works."
"LORELAI: The inn?"
"TRIX: I thought we could all have dinner there."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, sure. That would be great."
"TRIX: Wonderful. Tomorrow night, then."
"RORY: Oh. . ."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"TRIX: What?"
"LORELAI: It's just that tomorrow night we were planning to go to this winter carnival at the high school. . ."
"RORY: But we can skip it."
"TRIX: Absolutely not. Rory, you're a young person who works hard. It's equally important to have fun. You go to the carnival."
"RORY: Thank you."
"TRIX: Lorelai, you've had enough fun in your life."
"LORELAI: And then some."
"TRIX: Dinner will be for the grown-ups. Now, how is the birthday going?"
"RICHARD: Wonderfully. They're spoiling me rotten. Emily got me the most beautiful humidor. It's from 1917, and was owned by a lieutenant in World w*r I."
"TRIX: You know, your father had a humidor that was owned by Victor Hugo."
"RICHARD: Really?"
"TRIX: I still have it if you'd like it."
"RICHARD: Well, I'd love it."
"TRIX: Fine. I'll take care of it as soon as I get back to London. Now, if you will excuse me, I should like to freshen up."
"EMILY: I'll make sure the guest room's ready."
"RICHARD: Oh, I can do that, Emily."
"TRIX: Thank you, Richard. Emily, I expect to return in twenty minutes. That should give you enough time to pull my gifts out of storage and place them around the room as if they actually stand there all year. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: You want some help with those gifts?"
"EMILY: Yes, please."

"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"SOOKIE: Twelve courses, each paired with a specific wine, and for dessert, individual chocolate amaretto mousse cakes in the shape of a G."
"LORELAI: Sookie, look what you've done."
"SOOKIE: Over the top?"
"LORELAI: On a monumental scale."
"SOOKIE: Exactly what I was going for. I'm also going to have individual little menus printed up and placed at each setting."
"LORELAI: I love you for doing this."
"[Michel walks up to Lorelai with the phone]"
"MICHEL: Your mother is on the phone."
"LORELAI: Oh, can you take a message?"
"MICHEL: You mean, do I have the physical and mental capabilities to take a message? Why, yes, I do, however. . ."
"LORELAI: I got it. [takes the phone] Hey Mom."
"EMILY: She wants to see your house."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Tonight, before the dinner."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay."
"EMILY: Okay? Did you hear what I said? That horrifying woman wants to see your house. Your house  the one with the monkey lamp."
"LORELAI: Mom, relax."
"EMILY: Is it clean?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's clean."
"EMILY: If I came in there wearing white gloves, what would I find?"
"LORELAI: That you could pull a rabbit out of your hat?"
"EMILY: I don't know what to do. Oh, nevermind, I'll just figure it out when I get there."
"LORELAI: When you get where?"
"EMILY: I'll call you later, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: When you get where, Mom?"
"EMILY: I'm turning onto your street now."
"LORELAI: Mom, no!"
"EMILY: I'll just let myself in. I know you keep a key in the turtle or some ridiculous thing like that."
"LORELAI: Mom, I beg of you, make a very dangerous u-turn right now and go back where you came from."
"EMILY: I'm here. I'll talk to you later, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom. . .mom!"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory walks past a classroom as Francie opens the door]"
"FRANCIE: Oh, Rory, super. Could you step in here for a sec?"
"RORY: Oh, okay."
"FRANCIE: Thanks. I'm just so lucky I caught you."
"RORY: What is this?"
"FRANCIE: The supplementary student council meeting, silly."
"RORY: But Paris canceled that."
"FRANCIE: She did, didn't she? Hm."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LOUISE: You tell us."
"RORY: I don't know."
"MADELINE: Francie said there was an issue that has to be discussed."
"LOUISE: We figured you ok'ed it."
"RORY: I did not okay it. Mr. Hunter, there's been a mistake. Paris canceled this meeting and "
"MR. HUNTER: I know, Rory, but Francie approached me and said there was an issue that she had planned to discuss at the meeting today, and it has a bit of a ticking clock on it."
"RORY: You did not mention that you had anything."
"FRANCIE: I was just so surprised that Paris was canceling the meeting that it flew right out of my head. It was New York to London in three hours or less."
"RORY: I'll bet."
"MR. HUNTER: Rory, if you take a seat, we can get started."
"RORY: I move that we postpone this meeting until Paris can be reached."
"MR. HUNTER: We're all here now, let's just hear what Francie has to say. You can fill Paris in later. By the way, did anyone try to find her?"
"FRANCIE: I saw her walking off with. . .who was that, her brother?"
"LOUISE: Paris doesn't have a brother."
"FRANCIE: Really? Well, she certainly seemed to know him."
"RORY: Francie, why don't you just tell us all why we're here?"
"LOUISE: And how long we're staying."
"FRANCIE: The Wadsworth Mansion has just had a cancellation, which means that we can get it for prom, if we move quickly. Shall we vote?"
"RORY: Hold on  the Wadsworth Mansion is too expensive. We've already discussed this."
"FRANCIE: There are plenty of funds there to cover it."
"RORY: Not if we want a telescope to be the senior gift."
"FRANCIE: You mean, not if Paris wants a telescope to be the senior gift."
"RORY: We all thought it was a good idea."
"FRANCIE: Reach for the stars? Nice theme, original. Was Be all that you can be' taken?"
"RORY: It's a good gift."
"FRANCIE: It's a fine gift. However, so is planting a nice tree in the quad."
"RORY: Every class plants a tree."
"FRANCIE: Well, then, who are we to judge those who came before? I say, let's put it to a vote."
"RORY: This isn't right. Paris should be here."
"FRANCIE: I agree, Paris should be here. However, she's not, so once again, shall we vote?"
"MR. HUNTER: Rory, as student body vice president, I need you to call for a vote."
"RORY: All those in favor of using the funds for the Wadsworth Mansion, even though we will be cheating the next generation of Chilton students who would love a nice telescope, say aye."
"ALL: Aye."
"RORY: Wadsworth Mansion it is."
"FRANCIE: Meeting dismissed. Chin up, we'll make it a really big tree."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai pulls up to the house and goes inside. Emily is trying to move Lorelai's couch]"
"LORELAI: Hold it right there! Step back and move away from the couch."
"EMILY: This couch cannot stay."
"LORELAI: Yes, it can."
"EMILY: It's awful."
"LORELAI: It can hear you."
"EMILY: Please."
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Well, what about the chair? Let me move the chair."
"LORELAI: No, the chair stays also."
"EMILY: Well, we have to do something. I brought flowers over and can't find a decent vase. All I could find was a ceramic Betty Boop head."
"LORELAI: Mom, you're making yourself crazy."
"EMILY: I know. We'll get some tarps and throw them over everything and tell her that you're painting."
"LORELAI: Mom, stop it. What is so horrible about this room?"
"EMILY: Well, look at it."
"LORELAI: I am. I like it."
"EMILY: Well, you may like it, but your grandmother will not. She's going to take one look around here at the junk store collection of hobo furniture and she's going to blame me."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"EMILY: For letting you live like this. For not teaching you better. For not redecorating while you're out of town."
"LORELAI: Well, we're never out of town."
"EMILY: For not sending you out of town so I could redecorate!"
"LORELAI: Mom, you don't believe that."
"EMILY: Everything that's wrong in your life is my fault. Everything that's wrong in your father's life is my fault. Basically, everything's that wrong is my fault."
"LORELAI: Mom, would you sit down for a minute."
"[They both sit on the couch]"
"EMILY: And it's lumpy, perfect."
"LORELAI: Mom, if I may, I'd like to give you some advice."
"EMILY: You would?"
"LORELAI: You need to develop a defense mechanism for dealing with Grandma."
"EMILY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: You just need a system, a new mindset. Take me, for example."
"EMILY: What about you?"
"LORELAI: Well, I know there are many things in my life you don't approve of."
"EMILY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: Like this couch."
"EMILY: Well, this couch is terrible."
"LORELAI: Okay, good  you think the couch is terrible. Now, at one point in my life, you saying a couch that I carefully picked out and had to pay off over eight months is terrible might've hurt my feelings, but not anymore."
"EMILY: No?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because one day, I decided that instead of being hurt and upset by your disapproval, I'm gonna be amused. I'm gonna find it funny. I'm even going to take a little bit of pleasure in it."
"EMILY: You take pleasure in my disapproval?"
"LORELAI: I encourage it sometimes just for a laugh."
"EMILY: I don't know what to think of that."
"LORELAI: Think, hey, that's brilliant', because this idea could set you free."
"[Emily sighs]"
"LORELAI: Mom, what are you thinking about?"
"EMILY: That ridiculous Betty Boop head."
"LORELAI: [smiles] Mmhmm. So am I."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Francie is walking down the hall when Rory pulls her into the bathroom]"
"RORY: Francie, so good of you to stop by. I know how busy you are. Gum?"
"FRANCIE: What's your damage, Gilmore?"
"RORY: Damage? No damage. I just thought we should chat."
"FRANCIE: Yeah? Well, I don't have any"
"RORY: Oh, you know what, I changed my mind. I don't think we should chat, I think I should chat. Ready? Okay. That little stunt you pulled  not good."
"FRANCIE: Stunt?"
"RORY: Paris canceled that meeting."
"FRANCIE: Something came up."
"RORY: Then you should have brought it to Paris."
"FRANCIE: Paris wasn't around. She was off yet again with the mystery man."
"RORY: Jealous?"
"FRANCIE: Of Paris' lobotomy victim? I think not."
"RORY: What is wrong with you? So what if Paris has a boyfriend? You don't think that as hard as Paris works in school or on the Franklin or on student council - you don't think that she deserves to have a boyfriend and to enjoy it?"
"FRANCIE: Hey, no one is denying Gidget a chance to snag Moondoggie for the clambake, but the rest of us have things to accomplish."
"RORY: You've had one goal since the beginning of the year."
"FRANCIE: To achieve the perfect liquid line."
"RORY: To take Paris down."
"FRANCIE: And to achieve the perfect liquid line."
"RORY: I tried to intervene, I tried to smooth the path between both sides, but you know what? That's over."
"FRANCIE: Oh, it is?"
"RORY: Yes, it is. I'm finished being your go-between. You're a jerk, and if you wanna play it this way, then fine. All bets are off. I'm no longer your ally. You wanna play rough  fine. I've read The Art of w*r. I can be just as big a pain in your butt as you are in Paris', capiche?"
"FRANCIE: You do not wanna be my enemy, Marlo Thomas."
"RORY: I think I do, Tina Louise."
"FRANCIE: Fine."
"RORY: It is fine."
"FRANCIE: Can I go now?"
"RORY: The door's right there."
"FRANCIE: You're gonna be very sorry."
"RORY: Am I?"
"FRANCIE: Oh yes. . .you are."
"RORY: I'm good with that."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai is upstairs, Rory's in her bedroom. They holler back and forth to each other off-screen]"
"RORY: I'm running out of space."
"LORELAI: How many bouquets you got left?"
"RORY: Three."
"LORELAI: Can you put them on your dresser?"
"RORY: Dresser's full."
"LORELAI: Can you squish them in with another bunch?"
"RORY: Already squished."
"LORELAI: Can you toss them out the window like I did my last five bouquets?"
"RORY: Done."
"LORELAI: Great."
"[Lorelai walks down the stairs as Rory walks to the living room]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so monkey lamp's in the closet, singing rabbi's in a drawer, and all Spice Girl memorabilia's under your bed. How do I look?"
"RORY: Like a woman who does not own any Spice Girl memorabilia."
"LORELAI: You look pretty, too."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: And I want a play-by-play of the carnival tonight."
"RORY: I promise."
"LORELAI: And you can leave out all the "
"RORY: Hand kissing sounds, gladly."
"[there's a knock at the front door]"
"LORELAI: Oop, they're here."
"RORY: Hey, if she doesn't like the house  what happens then?"
"LORELAI: I think we have to move. Smile pretty."
"[they open the door]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom, hi Dad, hi Gran. Was your trip good?"
"TRIX: The trip was fine. Hello Rory."
"RORY: Hi Gran. Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa."
"TRIX: Now that we've exhausted the greetings, kindly move aside. I'd like to see your house."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on in."
"EMILY: If I pass out. . ."
"LORELAI: I'll yell timber. So, Gran, what do you think? I mean, it's not much. Probably too modest for Korn, but Weezer'd be pretty comfortable."
"[Gran walks around silently exploring the main floor of the house as the others follow behind her. They follow her back to the living room.]"
"TRIX: Let's go."
"RORY: Are we moving?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"EMILY: Lorelai, I swear to God, if you prolong this evening. . ."
"LORELAI: Coming."
"RORY: Have fun."
"EMILY: No one appreciates your sarcasm, young lady."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Jess walk down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: Boy, it's pretty out tonight, isn't it?"
"JESS: Sure is."
"RORY: Like a snow globe."
"JESS: Mmhmm."
"RORY: Sparkly. I mean, I don't think a night comes any prettier than this one. And if you take a really pretty night and add a corndog. . ."
"JESS: I'm not going to that carnival with you."
"RORY: Why not?"
"JESS: I will be in front of Miss Patty's at nine as promised."
"RORY: You are stubborn and impossible."
"JESS: See you at nine."
"[Dean and his sister walk toward them]"
"CLARA: Rory!"
"RORY: Clara, hi!"
"CLARA: I haven't seen you in forever."
"RORY: Longer than forever."
"DEAN: She got away from me."
"JESS: Buy a stronger leash."
"DEAN: Hey, uh, did you see they got the crazy psychic from Woodbury again?"
"RORY: You're kidding. I thought she got arrested."
"DEAN: She's out now and sitting right over there."
"RORY: I love her. She always tells me I'm gonna be rich and famous."
"DEAN: She tells everybody that they're gonna be rich and famous."
"CLARA: Who are you?"
"JESS: No one."
"CLARA: Yes, you are."
"JESS: No, I'm not."
"RORY: That's Jess. Jess, this is Clara."
"CLARA: Are you guys going to the carnival?"
"RORY: I'm going, Jess isn't."
"CLARA: Why not?"
"RORY: He has things to do."
"CLARA: Then you can go with me and Dean, right?"
"RORY: Oh, well. . ."
"JESS: I'm going."
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: To the carnival. I'm going to the carnival."
"CLARA: I thought you had things to do."
"JESS: Well, I don't."
"CLARA: Rory just said you had things to do."
"JESS: Hey Tatu, just look at the plane, will ya?"
"CLARA: What?"
"RORY: Jess, you don't have to go. We can meet later like you said."
"JESS: What? No. Come on, how many chances does a guy have to go to a Stars Hollow High winter carnival, right?"
"CLARA: Right."
"JESS: Okay, then. Let's go."
"CLARA: To the carnival!"
"JESS: To the carnival."
"CLARA: I want a pretzel and a snowcone and a cheese stick. . ."
"DEAN: Pace yourself."
"CLARA: Rory never tells me to pace myself."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai, Emily, Richard, and Trix walk into the dining room]"
"LORELAI: And this is our dining room."
"TRIX: Small."
"LORELAI: Or quaint."
"TRIX: Touche."
"RICHARD: Oh, you're in for a real treat, Trix. This Sookie is one of the best chefs around."
"LORELAI: Here's our table, Gran. Why don't you sit here?"
"TRIX: All right. Well, Lorelai, I must say, on first viewing, this little inn of yours looks quite impressive."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"TRIX: I mean, it's certainly no arboretum, but it's nice just the same."
"EMILY: It was just a suggestion, Mom."
"TRIX: Yes, it was. Oh, look, a menu."
"RICHARD: Well, that's a nice little touch."
"LORELAI: Well, Sookie wanted everything perfect for tonight."
"MICHEL: Hey, there you are."
"LORELAI: Oh, Michel, great. Gran, I'd like you to meet Michel Gerard, our concierge. Michel, this is my grandmother, Lorelai."
"MICHEL: Very pleased to meet you."
"TRIX: Do you have a pen?"
"MICHEL: Uh, why, of course."
"TRIX: Now, please take this to your chef. These are the times I would like each course to appear at this table. I like a brisk pace, twelve minutes per course is best for my digestion. However, please tell your servers that they are not to clear until everyone has finished. Thank you."
"MICHEL: Oh, no, thank you. It is so rare that I get to carry a note anymore."
"CUT TO CARNIVAL"
"CLARA: Is Jess your real name?"
"JESS: Yes."
"CLARA: Do you like it?"
"JESS: It's fine."
"CLARA: Would you rather be named Bill?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Frank?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Mike?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Bob?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Ed?"
"JESS: Does this belong to you?"
"DEAN: Clara, you want a snowcone?"
"CLARA: Yes. Will you go get me a snowcone?"
"JESS: Absolutely. Go stand in the middle of the street and wait for me, I'll be right back."
"DEAN: I'll get your snowcone."
"CLARA: And one for Rory, too."
"DEAN: And one for Rory, too."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Dean walks away]"
"CLARA: Do you wash your hair?"
"JESS: Yes, I wash my hair."
"CLARA: Then why does it stick up like that?"
"JESS: Because."
"CLARA: It looks crazy."
"LANE: Rory!"
"[Rory walks over to Lane's booth]"
"RORY: Hey, how's the fundraiser going? The turnout looks good."
"LANE: The turnout's great. Apparently, people are starved for entertainment around here."
"RORY: Well, hurrah for bad cable reception."
"LANE: So, I'm sorry, but did I just see you with Jess and Dean, or do I need a new prescription?"
"RORY: Your prescription's fine."
"LANE: So explain."
"RORY: Tomorrow at Luke's. I need to get back before there's a more exciting ending to the evening."
"LANE: Forget nothing."
"RORY: I promise."
"[Rory walks back to Jess and Clara. Jess is playing the Bottle Toss game]"
"CLARA: You missed. You missed. You missed."
"JESS: Hey, you wanna learn how to fly?"
"RORY: How's everybody doing?"
"CLARA: Jess can't throw."
"JESS: I can, too."
"CLARA: You missed every time."
"JESS: I can't concentrate with your annoying midget voice yammering on and on. It's like having Stuart Little shoved in my ear."
"[Dean walks over and hands Rory and Clara each a snowcone]"
"DEAN: Here. They only had cherry."
"RORY: Oh, that's all we need."
"DEAN: So, you play any of the games yet?"
"CLARA: Nope, I've been watching him lose. You don't get a bear, but it's still pretty fun."
"DEAN: Well, how about I go b*at you at ice bowling?"
"CLARA: You can't b*at me."
"DEAN: Oh, I think I can."
"CLARA: Let's go!"
"DEAN: We'll be back."
"RORY: Okay. So, how much to play?"
"JESS: A dollar."
"RORY: Okay."
"JESS: I got it."
"RORY: Just for the record, I'm a girl and we are supposed to throw like this."
"JESS: So you got anything you wanna tell me?"
"RORY: I like your crazy hair."
"JESS: You weren't just gonna go to the carnival with Dean?"
"RORY: No. Running into them was a total coincidence. I swear."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Not even close."
"JESS: So when did you and Dean get so buddy-buddy again?"
"RORY: We're not so buddy-buddy."
"JESS: Last time I checked, you weren't even speaking. Now he's fetching you snowcones?"
"RORY: He was getting one for Clara."
"JESS: You guys talking?"
"RORY: No, we're not talking. We talked, once."
"JESS: You got my interest."
"RORY: We ran into each other and he wanted to get coffee, so I did, and we talked."
"JESS: About?"
"RORY: Just boring things. Clara's horseback riding, his college application, nothing earth shattering."
"JESS: Uh huh."
"RORY: And he asked if we could be friends, and I said sure."
"JESS: Friends?"
"RORY: Jess, he knows we're together, okay? And it's a small town. Dean and I will see it each other, and I just thought it wouldn't hurt to be polite."
"JESS: So you're just being polite?"
"RORY: Yes. Dean has never done anything bad to me, and I just, I want to "
"JESS: I got it."
"RORY: You're mad."
"JESS: Nope, just figured you could've told me."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"JESS: No biggie. You gonna throw that?"
"RORY: You're really not mad?"
"JESS: Nope, not mad at all."
"RORY: And you understand?"
"JESS: I understand."
"RORY: And you believe me?"
"JESS: Like you're standing with an ax next to a cherry tree."
"RORY: And you're okay with it?"
"JESS: Will you just throw the ball?"
"RORY: Oh my God, I did it!"
"JESS: Very impressive."
"BOY: Here you go, congratulations. [hands her a stuffed bear]"
"RORY: Thanks. Hello sad, pathetic bear."
"JESS: You know, I could've bought you that thing for a quarter."
"RORY: No, it's better that I won it. Maybe Clara would like it."
"JESS: Yes, shoved in her mouth."
"RORY: She's cute."
"JESS: Oh, just darling."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"RICHARD: And so far, knock wood, things seem to be picking up."
"TRIX: Well, it's about time you went into business. Oh, Emily, you should've encouraged him to do this years ago."
"EMILY: Yes, I should've."
"TRIX: He's a go-getter, your father. Not completely dissimilar to yourself."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Gran."
"[Sookie walks over to them]"
"SOOKIE: Hello. Just wanted to check and see how your dinner was coming along."
"LORELAI: Sookie, it's amazing. Gran, this is our chef, Sookie."
"TRIX: The food is excellent."
"SOOKIE: Thank you very much."
"TRIX: Young lady, your uniform has a large cut down the middle of your back."
"SOOKIE: It does? Oh yeah, I did get myself, huh."
"EMILY: Sookie, how on earth did you do that?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, well, I. . . and the  the chop flew, so I lunged. . .and then the floor slipped. . . and then. . .ooh! You know, and I just. . .did a flip, ya know. I guess you just kind of had to be there."
"TRIX: Yes, apparently so."
"SOOKIE: Okay, well, nice to meet you. I have to get back. We have quite a tight schedule to follow."
"TRIX: Yes, we do."
"[Sookie walks away]"
"RICHARD: So, Trix, let's talk about the Hartford house. Do you have a new tenant lined up yet?"
"TRIX: Yes, I do."
"RICHARD: Hmm. Who?"
"TRIX: Me."
"EMILY: What?"
"TRIX: I wasn't going to bring this up tonight, but since you asked, my health hasn't been too good lately."
"RICHARD: What, what's the matter?"
"TRIX: What the matter is, I'm not twenty. Anyhow, the weather in London is quite damp, and I have a yearning to be a little closer to my immediate family, so now that Korn has moved out of my house, I thought perhaps I would move back in."
"LORELAI: Um, when, Gran?"
"TRIX: As soon as I can close up the London house and get my affairs in order."
"RICHARD: Well, I think that's a wonderful idea. I'm thrilled. In fact, I'm so thrilled, I'm not going to be angry with you for not telling me you were in ill health."
"TRIX: I will be fine, Richard."
"RICHARD: You will be fine, because as soon as you're back here, I'm going to send you to the finest doctors."
"TRIX: Whatever you say."
"RICHARD: And Emily and I are going to look after you completely, day and night. You can count on us."
"TRIX: I knew I could. Oh, it's time for the next course. Waiter, our next course please."
"EMILY: I'm not done."
"TRIX: What do you mean, you're not done? You had twelve minutes."
"EMILY: I'm not done."
"TRIX: Fine, we will wait."
"[Emily begins to slowly eat the rest of her meal]"
"LORELAI: That'll do, pig. That'll do."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Dean is reading a bulletin board in the hallway]"
"JESS: Need some help with the big words?"
"DEAN: Sure. Why don't you come over here and I'll show you which one's giving me a hard time."
"JESS: You're getting a little pathetic man."
"DEAN: Thanks for the heads up."
"JESS: Let's be friends?"
"DEAN: No thanks."
"JESS: You don't think I know what you're doing? You don't think it's so pathetically transparent?"
"DEAN: Get out of here, Jess."
"JESS: Rory's taking pity on you. That's why the sudden interest in being your friend. You know that?"
"DEAN: Whatever you say."
"JESS: The saddest part of this whole thing is. . ."
"DEAN: Man, you like hearing yourself talk."
"JESS: You really think that by being her friend, you're gonna get her back."
"DEAN: I don't know what you're talking about."
"JESS: No, huh?"
"DEAN: Rory and I are just friends, just like you and Rory were just friends. And hey, look how it turned out for you."
"[Clara walks out of the bathroom]"
"CLARA: Okay, I'm ready for popcorn."
"DEAN: You got it."
"CLARA: Bye Jess. You think Rory wants some popcorn?"
"DEAN: I don't know. Let's go ask her."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the front porch]"
"RORY: This is very impressive."
"LORELAI: Not as impressive as my mother making four green beans last an hour and a half."
"RORY: I wish I'd seen that."
"LORELAI: When she finally got to the last bean, she cut it in six pieces. I swear, I thought Gran was gonna lunge across the table at her."
"RORY: The student surpasses the master."
"LORELAI: I was a little proud. Although I'm bummed I missed the carnival."
"RORY: There's a snowcone in the freezer for you."
"LORELAI: How'd it finally end with Cheech and Chong?"
"RORY: Jess knows I'm friends with Dean, Dean knows I'm dating Jess, and they both seem fine with it. What?"
"LORELAI: I just like that once in awhile, you still seem like a little kid."
"RORY: They do, I swear."
"LORELAI: Let's just watch the snow."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The maid opens the door for Lorelai and Rory]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MAID: Good evening. May I take your coats?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure, thanks."
"EMILY: [from living room] That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard."
"MAID: Your mother's in the living room."
"LORELAI: So last chance to run, huh?"
"MAID: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Just ignore her."
"[They walk to the living room. Emily is talking on the phone and doesn't see them come in]"
"EMILY: Of course I said it. Well, I can't imagine who would take jackbooted as a compliment. I will not apologize. Every time she went to the pantry, I thought she was marching on Poland. Oh, I see, because I want things a certain way, I'm unreasonable?"
"[Lorelai pours herself a glass of wine]"
"RORY: Shh!"
"EMILY: Why, that is the most absurd. . .I want to see this document. Fax it to me immediately."
"LORELAI: Fax it to me immediately?"
"RORY: She's part of the electronic age."
"EMILY: Tomorrow morning is completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable because I'm paying you three hundred dollars an hour. So turn that little near-luxury car around, go back to your office, and fax me that libelous scrap of paper."
"LORELAI: Ask him if he can pick up some ice cream, too."
"EMILY: Well, tell your wife to tape your daughter's recital. [hangs up] Unbelievable."
"[Emily turns around and sees Lorelai and Rory on the couch]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: When did you two get here?"
"LORELAI: Sometime between the second absurd and the third unbelievable."
"EMILY: I apologize. That call caught me off guard."
"RORY: Is everything all right, Grandma?"
"EMILY: Everything's fine."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"EMILY: I'm sure."
"LORELAI: You look peeved."
"EMILY: I'm not peeved."
"LORELAI: Well, you look peeved."
"EMILY: Kindly stop making me say the word peeved."
"LORELAI: Mom, spill it. What's wrong?"
"EMILY: That was our lawyer calling to inform me that one of our former maids is suing for wrongful termination."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"EMILY: You might at least act surprised."
"LORELAI: It's not the first time, is it?"
"EMILY: It most certainly is."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"EMILY: Yes, Lorelai, really."
"LORELAI: Well, then, I'm surprised."
"EMILY: It's beyond surprising, it's outrageous."
"RORY: What did Grandpa say?"
"EMILY: Your Grandfather's still in London helping his mother close down her house. Of course he'd be gone when this happens."
"LORELAI: I think he planned it that way."
"RORY: Which maid was it?"
"EMILY: Gerta, the one from Hamburg, Germany."
"LORELAI: Which one was she?"
"RORY: You remember  she was the one you made all those Hamburg/hamburger jokes to."
"LORELAI: God, I b*at that dead horse."
"RORY: With glee."
"EMILY: She was the clomper."
"LORELAI: The clomper?"
"EMILY: She'd be upstairs making the beds and it'd sound like a Munich beer hall rally."
"LORELAI: That's why you fired her?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Because she made noise when she walked?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Was she a good maid otherwise?"
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Besides the clomping, was she polite, on time, made sure the little fork went on the outside?"
"EMILY: Have you been listening to me? She was not performing her duties as I wished them to be performed. Everything else is beside the point."
"LORELAI: Well, I guess it's always something, isn't it?"
"EMILY: What's that supposed to mean?"
"LORELAI: It means you always seem to find the one thing about a maid that negates all of her good qualities. I mean, at a certain point, isn't it just easier to let a couple things slide?"
"EMILY: I see. So it's my fault?"
"LORELAI: I didn't say that."
"EMILY: No, Lorelai, you did. For years, I've been listening to you and your father and everyone else go on and on about how demanding I am, how I have to have things a certain way. Well, guess what? I pay to have them that way. I pay more than anyone else pays their maids, and when things are not the way I want, that means I'm not getting what I paid for. Why is that so hard to understand?"
"LORELAI: It isn't hard to understand, it's just "
"EMILY: If you pay for first class and the airline sticks you in coach, people expect you to be upset. No one calls you demanding or unreasonable. And yet here is this woman whom I pay more than she can get anywhere else in Hartford, whose severance package could finance a summer cruise down the Rhine, dragging me into court saying that I was unfair. Why? Because having paid for one thing, I'm not content with something else? That makes me unfair? Well, then, so be it. Let someone else pay first class and ride in steerage, not me."
"MAID: Excuse me, Mrs. Gilmore, dinner's ready"
"EMILY: Thank you, Brooke, we'll be right there."
"[Brooke walks away; Lorelai and Rory start to get up]"
"EMILY: Wait, wait, wait. Do you hear that?"
"LORELAI: Hear what?"
"EMILY: Exactly."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai is watching Sookie and Jackson argue]"
"SOOKIE: You know, next time I want some grapefruit, I'm just gonna ask for a kazoo because you can only seem to get me the most bizarre opposite."
"JACKSON: What is your problem?"
"[Michel walks in]"
"MICHEL: I need you to "
"LORELAI: Shh!"
"MICHEL: What? Oh, it started. You were supposed to call me."
"LORELAI: Stop talking."
"JACKSON: I understand perfectly. You wanna be a dictator."
"SOOKIE: Oh, come off it."
"JACKSON: Commandant St. James says, ""Brussels sprouts! You will bring me the Brussels sprouts."""
"SOOKIE: I'm trying to plan a menu here, Jackson!"
"MICHEL: Fill me in, please."
"LORELAI: Jackson brought pea tendrils instead of Brussels sprouts."
"MICHEL: Well, aren't we Evil Knievel?"
"LORELAI: Coffee?"
"MICHEL: Oh, please."
"SOOKIE: Pea tendrils are too delicate to serve with the lamb shank!"
"JACKSON: I don't think that they are."
"SOOKIE: Where are the Brussels sprouts?"
"JACKSON: I looked at the stalks, they weren't good enough."
"SOOKIE: You always do this to me."
"JACKSON: Doesn't it matter that I care so much about the quality of the produce that I sell you that I'd be willing to risk an enormous argument just to save your dinner."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Oops, that was dumb."
"SOOKIE: Save my dinner?"
"JACKSON: You know what I meant."
"SOOKIE: Yes, my dinner is out standing on a ledge. Oh no! What's gonna happen?"
"JACKSON: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Oh wait! What's that? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Super Jackson and his atomic pea tendrils!"
"JACKSON: You wanna get another produce guy?"
"SOOKIE: Maybe I should!"
"JACKSON: Well, go ahead!"
"SOOKIE: Don't tempt me!"
"JACKSON: That's it, I am leaving."
"SOOKIE: Go! And take the tendrils with you!"
"JACKSON: Fine! See you tonight?"
"SOOKIE: I love you."
"LORELAI: And it always ends with a hug."
"MICHEL: Hm."
"LORELAI: Okay, what do you need?"
"MICHEL: The new insurance policies you ordered."
"LORELAI: Good. Now the inspector's supposed to be coming by to check the place out tomorrow, so you're gonna have to show him around."
"MICHEL: What?"
"LORELAI: You're covering for me, remember?"
"MICHEL: Oh, yes, that's right. Tomorrow the two of you go back to school."
"LORELAI: It's not school, it's a one-day course at the learning center."
"SOOKIE: How to run an inn."
"MICHEL: Yes, amazing you've been able to fake it so long."
"LORELAI: This is specific to opening small inns, bed and breakfasts."
"MICHEL: I see. Order half of everything. There  you owe me seventy-five dollars."
"LORELAI: Why are you being such a snob about this? You went to hotel school."
"MICHEL: I attended the Ecole Hôtelière de Genève."
"LORELAI: Wow, that's gotta make one hell of a sweatshirt."
"MICHEL: It was one of the premiere hotel schools in the world. You two, on the other hand, are going to take a two-hour course at the Radisson."
"SOOKIE: Jackson's taken a lot of courses through The Learning Center and he loves it. He took beekeeping "
"LORELAI: Jackson keeps bees?"
"SOOKIE: No, it turned out he was allergic. One stung his lip and his whole head blew up to three times his normal size."
"MICHEL: Please tell me you have pictures."
"SOOKIE: He also took a course in how to buy foreclosed real estate, and how to write a diary."
"LORELAI: How do you not know how to write a diary?"
"SOOKIE: He's a searcher."
"LORELAI: Yes, he is."
"SOOKIE: Plus, I think he was really lonely before we got together and he didn't live near a good bar."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, I predict that tomorrow will be a complete waste of time and money, and I will be here to laugh at you when you return."
"LORELAI: Thanks for your support. Forget him. Opening our own is a huge step, and anything that might help is worth trying."
"SOOKIE: Exactly partner."
"LORELAI: Now tell me you got pictures of Jackson and his giant head."
"SOOKIE: I'll bring them in tomorrow."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory walks into the meeting room; Paris is going through some papers]"
"RORY: Hey Paris."
"PARIS: Have you looked over the votes for commencement speaker?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"PARIS: Are the ones for Princess Diana's butler jokes or real?"
"RORY: I'd say jokes."
"PARIS: What about the ones for Dr. Phil?"
"RORY: I think real."
"PARIS: I knew that suggestion box was a bad idea. Watch Choate get Joan Didion while we're being read ""Eloise at the Plaza."""
"RORY: Listen, before the others get here, we should probably decide what we're going to do."
"PARIS: About what?"
"RORY: About the prom coup Francie staged last week."
"PARIS: You mean booking Wadsworth Mansion?"
"RORY: Using all of the money reserved for the telescope that we wanted to buy for the senior gift."
"PARIS: Why does one pinhead always have to vote for Jerry Garcia?"
"RORY: I'm not sure if the deposit check has been sent yet, but -"
"PARIS: I already took care of that."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Wadsworth Mansion is owned by the Connecticut Daughters of the Mayflower. Most of those biddies couldn't negotiate an icy sidewalk much less a contract. Took me about five minutes on the phone to get them down to half their asking price."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"PARIS: Well, there was no way I was letting the class gift be a stupid tree just so Ginger Spice can have her Barbie dream prom."
"RORY: She's a sneak."
"PARIS: She's not smart enough to be a sneak. Anyone can call a meeting. It's that loser Mr. Hunter that let her get away with it."
"RORY: Well, she kind of forced him into it."
"PARIS: You can't force a teacher into something, Rory. No, it was Hunter. He's been jealous of me since I got into office. Whenever I announce I have a new motion to introduce, he flinches. Actually, physically tightens up for a moment. It's creepy."
"RORY: Yeah, but "
"FRANCIE: Well, out fearless leaders at work already. I feel so safe."
"RORY: That girl bugs me."
"PARIS: Relax, she's harmless."
"MR. HUNTER: Paris, Rory."
"PARIS: Paris, Rory. Bed wetter. Shall we sit?"
"RORY: Fine, let's sit."
"PARIS: I call this meeting of the student council to order. Is the secretary ready?"
"MADELINE: I am."
"PARIS: Then let's proceed. First of all, I'd like to apologize for missing last week's somewhat impromptu meeting. As most of you know, its scheduling was somewhat unorthodox since the meeting was a supplementary meeting, which was a concept invented by me. So the fact that anyone would hold a meeting invented by a certain person without that certain person seems, well. . .let's see, what's the word? Mutinous, insulting, underhanded, and in the end, fruitless, since I managed to re-negotiate the rental fee for the Wadsworth Mansion so that we'll be able to have the prom and give the school a respectable senior gift in the form of a telescope. Any questions, Mr. Christian? I mean, Mr. Hunter."
"MR. HUNTER: Uh, no."
"PARIS: Good. So, now that that's out of the way, let's move onto other business. Francie?"
"FRANCIE: As you know, Health Week is coming up. We have speakers lined up to discuss everything from heart disease and exercise to the dangers of sun damage and fried food. Everyone's booked and ready to go. The only thing left to figure out is where to set up the sign-up table for the annual blood drive."
"[Madeline screams]"
"FRANCIE: Geez!"
"RORY: What's the matter?"
"LOUISE: She hates the word blood."
"FRANCIE: Give me a heart attack."
"LOUISE: Just keep your hands on your ears."
"MADELINE: Tell me when it's over."
"FRANCIE: As I was saying before the freak-out, we need to figure out where to place the sign up table for the blood drive."
"MADELINE: I can still here her."
"LOUISE: Hum to yourself."
"PARIS: Continue, please."
"FRANCIE: I am proposing putting it in the cafeteria. It's got easy access, maximum exposure, and almost ninety percent of the student body visits the cafeteria every day. It's the perfect location."
"PARIS: Well?"
"RORY: No."
"FRANCIE: Excuse me?"
"RORY: You can't set up in the cafeteria. It's a fire hazard."
"PARIS: It is?"
"RORY: Yes, it's a fire hazard. You'll have to find another place."
"FRANCIE: You're kidding."
"RORY: I never kid about fire safety."
"FRANCIE: Well, Rory, I actually know the fire codes for the cafeteria, and as long as we don't cram more than three hundred people in there, we can start an opium den and the fire department wouldn't care."
"RORY: A, Francie, I think they would care, and B, I'm not talking about numbers. You set up that table, get people thinking about blood, someone smells smoke, and the next thing you know, fifty stampeding teenagers are using your body to lever open a door. I won't allow that."
"FRANCIE: This is Xanadu-level of insane."
"PARIS: You do realize you're opposing the blood drive?"
"RORY: No, I'm opposing the blood drive in the cafeteria."
"PARIS: Is it really that big a deal?"
"RORY: It's the rules, Paris, the rules of common decency, and I'll be damned if I let Francie ignore those rules."
"PARIS: Well, okay, motion denied. The senior class president will come up with an alternate plan for the location of the sign-up table for the blood drive. Now Louise, poke John Williams over there and tell her she can cut the score, we're moving on. Advertising space in the yearbook is only fifty percent sold as of right now. What are we doing to do about this? Roger, yes?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is in the living room when Lorelai walks through the front door with two takeout bags]"
"LORELAI: Dinner!"
"RORY: Over here."
"LORELAI: We are so in luck. It was international grab bag night at Al's."
"RORY: Cool. Did you peek?"
"LORELAI: And ruin the whole point of the mystery dinner? I think not. Pick."
"RORY: That one."
"LORELAI: Okay. I love this. It's food and a game all in one. Now we open them at the same time."
"RORY: I know the rules."
"LORELAI: And do not jump the g*n."
"RORY: There's a lot of pressure associated with international grab bag night."
"LORELAI: Well, I am your mother, it is my responsibility to give you structure. Now, on three  one, two, three."
"[they both open their bags and smell the food]"
"RORY: Hm, Moroccan."
"LORELAI: You always say Moroccan."
"RORY: And sooner or later, I will be right. What's yours?"
"LORELAI: Pan-Asian, with a hint of English Colonial, and a few South African influences."
"RORY: Way to hedge your bet. Kitchen?"
"LORELAI: Just let me check the machine."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Rory walks to the kitchen. Lorelai checks the answering machine]"
"ANSWERING MACHINE: Ms. Gilmore, it's Bob Merrimam, your mother's lawyer. I'm calling about the little matter of this lawsuit she's involved in. We'd like it if you could give a deposition. . ."
"LORELAI: Uh. [picks up the phone and dials a number]"
"ANSWERING MACHINE: . . on her behalf. It shouldn't be a big deal. If you could just call me tomorrow with some times that would be convenient for you, I can set something up. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, no!"
"ANSWERING MACHINE: . . .Thanks, bye."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: No, no, no, no, no."
"EMILY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Who is this?"
"LORELAI: I am not giving a deposition."
"EMILY: Of course you are, don't be ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Please leave me out of this."
"EMILY: I see. So you're just going to let this lead-footed teutonic chambermaid drag your mother into a public forum and humiliate her, is that it? Is that what I'm hearing?"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Her lawyer knows we asked for this deposition. How do you think it's going to look when you refuse to testify for your own mother?"
"LORELAI: Like it's none of my business."
"EMILY: Oh, and I'm sure the twelve rocket scientists they assemble as a jury of my peers will see it that way."
"LORELAI: Honestly, Mom, I doubt they'll be able to find twelve people in the state of Connecticut who haven't been fired by you."
"EMILY: I can't believe my own daughter won't come to my defense."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you."
"EMILY: I just want you to tell them how I treat my maids."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you."
"EMILY: All you have to do is tell them I treat the help fairly."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you."
"EMILY: Lorelai, there is something called family loyalty. It means when someone is in trouble, you help them, as I have helped you several times over the years. The very least you could do in return is spend half an hour saying something kind about your mother."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"EMILY: Thank you. Your devotion is touching. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: I have to give a deposition."
"RORY: I don't think this is Moroccan  or at least not recently."
"LORELAI: Want some of mine?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Yikes. Luke's?"
"RORY: Let's go."
"CUT TO THE LEARNING CENTER"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are in their class about opening an inn]"
"LECTURER: I can't stress enough the value of a good paint job. One of the first decisions you'll have to make when you open your inn is whether to employ your housekeepers individually or contract out to a housekeeping service. If you use a service, you will be assured of having a replacement housekeeper if one should call in sick or quit suddenly."
"SOOKIE: But you'll pay two dollars more an hour and they'll be loyal to the service, not to you."
"LECTURER: However, you'll probably end up paying a bit more than if you hired them individually."
"SOOKIE: I can't believe you're taking notes. He has said nothing in the last two hours that we didn't already know, and he's saying it really condescendingly. So in addition to being bored, I'm getting hostile, and a little insecure cause you're studying and I'm not."
"[Lorelai displays the cootie catcher she's just made]"
"LORELAI: Pick a color."
"SOOKIE: Pink!"
"LORELAI: Cause you're a girl."
"SOOKIE: Exactly."
"LORELAI: Pink. Pick a number."
"SOOKIE: Five."
"LORELAI: [opens the flap] You will marry Shaun Cassidy and cheat with David."
"SOOKIE: Well, good for me."
"LORELAI: My turn."
"LECTURER: [clears throat] Some of us are here to learn."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, sorry."
"LORELAI: We had a cootie catcher. . ."
"SOOKIE: We're sorry."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"LECTURER: As I was saying, the points we've covered should get you started, but remember, it's a long process, so don't get discouraged. I'm sure one day I'll be staying in each and every one of you inns."
"LORELAI: He's not staying in our inn."
"LECTURER: Now don't run off just yet. We've got one final treat. I'd like to introduce you all to John Mattern."
"JOHN: Hello everyone. I'm very pleased to be here addressing you today. I asked Brian if I could just have a few minutes at the end of today to show you all some opportunities that I think you're going to find really exciting. I know that I do. If we could. [turns on the slide projector] Now this is a lovely property that has just become available right outside of Litchfield."
"SOOKIE: It's a sales pitch?"
"LORELAI: They spend two hours telling us nothing, then try to sell us lame property?"
"SOOKIE: We already know the place we're buying."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: So what do we do?"
"LORELAI: I'm crushing your head, I'm crushing your head. Let's go."
"[Lorelai and Sookie get up and leave]"
"JOHN: A perfectly restorable sun porch wraps around the entire main structure. Let's step inside this diamond in the rough."
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk out of the room]"
"SOOKIE: Unbelievably shocking."
"LORELAI: That we could work at an inn for so long and learn so little."
"SOOKIE: We must be some kind of dumb."
"LORELAI: Who would ever have thought that all inns need doors?"
"SOOKIE: Not me."
"LORELAI: And floors."
"SOOKIE: Doors and floors, we can't afford that."
"LORELAI: Well, we better, otherwise our guests will fall right through to China."
"SOOKIE: I can just imagine the phone calls."
"LORELAI: What was Jackson thinking saying these courses were good?"
"SOOKIE: Please, you're asking me? The man took a course in diary writing."
"[they reach the refreshment table]"
"LORELAI: Thank God  food."
"SOOKIE: So, is it worth it if we can make up our seventy-five dollar admission fee in cookies?"
"LORELAI: Well, considering that in the past hour, I uttered the phrase, ""My God, I should've listened to Michel,"" these better be the best damn cookies in the world."
"SOOKIE: [tries one] And they taste like feet."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, even their cookies suck. Stand by, I'm going in for coffee."
"[two men walk up to them]"
"JOE: Sookie? Sookie St. James?"
"SOOKIE: Uh huh."
"JOE: It's Joe. . . Joe Mastoni from the Deerhill Lodge."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, Joe! Joe! Joe from the Deerhill Lodge! It's Joe from the Deerhill Lodge! How are you? Sorry. Well, come here. [hugs him] Oh! Lorelai, this is Joe. Joe, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"JOE: Nice to meet you. This is Alex, my partner."
"ALEX: Business partner."
"LORELAI: Oh, clarification duly noted. Nice to meet you."
"SOOKIE: Joe and I worked together one summer up in the Berkshires."
"JOE: Oh, God, we had a wild time that summer, didn't we?"
"LORELAI: You had a wild time, huh? Do tell."
"SOOKIE: We'd all work fourteen hours straight, party til dawn, then pile in Joe's van and wake up in New Hampshire or Maine with just enough time to get back for the next shift."
"JOE: We had a real interesting crew. Sookie, me, Feldman, Mellon, Bung "
"LORELAI: Bung?"
"SOOKIE: He was the grill man. He had been up there for a couple years already, but Joe and I were both in prep."
"LORELAI: And I repeat - Bung?"
"ALEX: Don't look at me. I'm still wondering if Mellon's a man or a woman."
"JOE: You know, I promised myself after that summer, I would never chop small green things en masse ever again."
"SOOKIE: Or drink all the leftover wine on an empty stomach."
"JOE: Let me see your hands. Hey, nice blisters."
"SOOKIE: Let me see yours. Ooh, not bad, not bad."
"JOE: I'm more careful about using the towels with the hot stuff these days."
"SOOKIE: Sissy."
"JOE: Yeah, yeah. So what are you doing here?"
"SOOKIE: Lorelai and I are opening an inn together, so we came for a class."
"JOE: Really? Alex and I are here for a class about opening your own coffee place."
"ALEX: Chain of coffee places, actually."
"SOOKIE: That's great."
"JOE: We'll see. It's pretty new territory for us."
"ALEX: Joe at least knows the food industry. I'm coming from ironworks, so I basically know what the security gate you pull down at the end of the night should be made of."
"JOE: Don't listen to him. Alex is an incredible businessman."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"ALEX: That's true."
"JOE: So far, we've got the business model planned out, there's a couple of prime locations we're interested in. The only thing left to do besides build the place is pick a name."
"LORELAI: Oh, little tip, don't choose anything cute."
"SOOKIE: Like Jitters."
"LORELAI: Or Spill the Beans."
"SOOKIE: Or Higher Ground."
"LORELAI: Or The Mudhouse."
"ALEX: Actually, I kinda like that."
"LORELAI: Oh, me too. We call dibs."
"ALEX: I thought you were opening an inn."
"LORELAI: Well, we wanna keep our options open."
"JOE: Hey, did you hear about Feldman's restaurant?"
"SOOKIE: The Feldster opened a restaurant?"
"LORELAI: Okay, I know I'm repeating myself, but the Feldster?"
"SOOKIE: I can't believe he opened his own place. He spent the whole summer getting stoned in the walk-in."
"JOE: He was our baker."
"LORELAI: Right, that figures."
"SOOKIE: Huh?"
"ALEX: Baker, getting baked, I'm there."
"LORELAI: Oh, congratulations. You still can't have The Mudhouse."
"JOE: Hey, you remember the last reception we catered? The parakeets, everyone dressed as knights and ladies."
"SOOKIE: Oh God!"
"ALEX: Old friends, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, there's nothing like them."
"SOOKIE: I never did figure out how Bung got into a fight with the bride."
"JOE: One minute everything was fine, the next he's beaning her with the ice sculpture."
"LORELAI: Hey, remember the time you and Fat Sal got locked in the freezer overnight?"
"ALEX: Fat Sal?"
"LORELAI: Work with me here."
"ALEX: Oh, Fat Sal, yes, right."
"SOOKIE: Then Feldman got into a fight with the bride's mother."
"JOE: That's right! He went after the whole bridal party."
"LORELAI: And you remember how me and the Bruiser "
"ALEX: Never liked that guy."
"LORELAI: We found you and Fat Sal in the morning and you were frozen together like bacon."
"ALEX: Yeah. You know, I still can't eat bacon."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"JOE: And you remember what Feldman told the cops?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah!"
"LORELAI: And then before Bruiser and I would let you out, we made you and Fat Sal kiss."
"ALEX: I'm not sure I remember that."
"SOOKIE: You know, I actually don't remember what Feldman told the cops."
"JOE: He tried to pretend he didn't speak English, remember?"
"SOOKIE: That's right, oh my God! The flooginshorts!"
"JOE: Yes, the flooginshorts!"
"LORELAI: Oh, great. Now we have to make up our own language?"
"ALEX: This is getting exhausting."
"JOE: You know, Feldman's restaurant's right here in Hartford."
"SOOKIE: No, really?"
"JOE: Yeah. We should swing by one night and bust his chops."
"SOOKIE: Hey, yeah, we could keep sending back plate after plate until he gets so angry he comes out."
"JOE: Let's make a plan."
"SOOKIE: Sure. Call me at the Independence Inn, that's where we work."
"LORELAI: For now."
"JOE: Sounds great. I'm so glad we ran into each other."
"SOOKIE: Me too."
"JOE: And it was nice meeting you, Lorelai. Good luck with everything."
"LORELAI: Thanks, you too."
"ALEX: I'm really glad we got a chance to catch up."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. Hey, if you see Fat Sal, give him a kiss for me."
"ALEX: I'll do that."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Bye."
"[Alex and Joe walk away]"
"SOOKIE: Wait, so you and that guy knew each other, too? What a coincidence!"
"LORELAI: Come on, honey."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Rory and Paris sit down at a table with their lunch trays]"
"PARIS: How many times do I have to tell them? You can't put a two-inch ladle of gravy into a one-inch potato crater. You either need a smaller ladle or a bigger crater  otherwise, you get this."
"RORY: Gravy on your asparagus."
"PARIS: Yes."
"RORY: Paris, the cafeteria workers serve hundreds of students a day. A little gravy spillage is natural."
"PARIS: I see. So I should just sit quietly and shovel in whatever slop they throw my way like some inmate in the chow line at Leavenworth doing twenty to life? I don't think so."
"RORY: I'll save your seat."
"[Paris walks away. A paper airplane lands on Rory's tray, it says ""We need to meet. Write down a time and place."" Rory writes on it, then hears a noise and turns around. Someone takes the airplane when her back is turned. Paris walks back to the table.]"
"PARIS: They took my tray. I can't believe they took my tray. All I did was go up there and tell them I wanted some new asparagus, and they took my tray. Well, I also told them to buy a slightly looser hair net, one that wouldn't squish the part of the brain that can judge depth and measurements, and then they took my tray, but still. . .now what? You gonna eat that?"
"[Rory gives Paris her lunch tray]"
"CUT TO PARKING GARAGE"
"[Rory walks through an empty parking garage. She hears a noise, and turns to find Francie]"
"FRANCIE: Good, you're here. We need to talk."
"RORY: We have three classes together, we couldn't talk then?"
"FRANCIE: I thought alone would be better. Besides, you picked the place."
"RORY: What do you want?"
"FRANCIE: I want a truce."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"FRANCIE: A truce, you know, no more fighty fighty."
"RORY: I don't believe you."
"FRANCIE: Look, this is not the way I wanted things to work out, honestly. Yes, the hemline thing bugged me, and yes, Paris is not my idea of a secret sister, but I never intended for things to go so far."
"RORY: No?"
"FRANCIE: No. I mean, it's my senior year, too. Why would I want to spend the whole time scheming and fighting? It's too exhausting. I wanna stop this w*r, this vendetta, this Sicilian thing. It must end."
"RORY: This seems awful sudden."
"FRANCIE: Yes, well, my time is precious, so if I'm not gonna truly commit to a grudge, I'd like to move on and put that energy somewhere else. Come on, what do you say? Friends, sort of?"
"RORY: Friends. . .sort of."
"FRANCIE: Shake."
"[They shake hands. A car alarm goes off, startling Rory. When she turns back around, Francie is gone]"
"RORY: Stop doing that."
""

"CUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks up to Michel at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so you'll come in early and set up the conference room for the group from Michigan."
"MICHEL: Yes, I will."
"LORELAI: Okay. Now, Sookie's on top of the menu. Let's make sure the, uh, dining room's open for a late lunch, and we need to confirm the number of rooms they'll need."
"MICHEL: Yes, I have all of this written down on a notepad right next to my self-help book, ""Why Don't People Think You Know What The Hell You're Doing?"""
"LORELAI: Sorry. I'm just a little stressed at this whole stupid deposition thing."
"MICHEL: Relax, it's very easy."
"LORELAI: It is? You've done it?"
"MICHEL: Once, it was nothing."
"LORELAI: Why were you deposed?"
"MICHEL: My neighbor had this dog, a frisky little scamp that used to love to yap to his friends all night long. It was so cute. Then one day he disappeared. I told the police what I knew, but sadly the adorable little chatterbox was never found. It was tragic."
"LORELAI: You got rid of a dog?"
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: How could you get rid of a dog?"
"MICHEL: I will gladly show you the transcript from the lawyer and the results of the lie detector test."
"LORELAI: You're heinous."
"MICHEL: And very well rested."
"[Michel walks away as Joe enters the inn]"
"JOE: Lorelai, hi. Remember me?"
"LORELAI: Of course I do. Nice to see you again, Joe."
"JOE: This is a beautiful place you have here."
"LORELAI: Ah, well, you know. . . keeps the rain off."
"JOE: Right. So, is Sookie around?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, uh, she is. Uh, right through there in the kitchen."
"JOE: Thank you."
"[Joe walks away as Michel walks back over]"
"MICHEL: Here, give me those. I'll file them with the rest."
"[Lorelai barks at him]"
"MICHEL: Ah, stop that!"
"CUT TO THE KITCHEN"
"[Joe walks in to find Sookie]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, I'll just be a minute."
"JOE: Oh no, don't rush."
"SOOKIE: I was almost finished with the dinner prep, and then I changed my mind about two of the appetizers."
"JOE: Sounds like old times. Though, I gotta say, this place is a long way from the sweatbox at the Deerhill."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, we've upgraded a lot in the past few years. We just got a refrigerated prep table and we replaced the two vertical mixers."
"JOE: But you still got the old fifty-two inch Viking."
"SOOKIE: I know. I just like how big it is. I blew it up once."
"JOE: Wow."
"SOOKIE: But I had them rebuild it. I refuse to cook on anything else."
"JOE: Stick with what you know."
"SOOKIE: Exactly. Taste this."
"JOE: Maybe a bit more brandy."
"SOOKIE: I knew you'd say that."
"JOE: Well, people like brandy."
"SOOKIE: You mean you like brandy."
"JOE: And I'm people. We always had a good time together, didn't we?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, it was a good group."
"JOE: You always made it better."
"SOOKIE: Cause I kept you fools from driving off the side of a mountain."
"JOE: Very true. You know, I'm really glad we ran into each other. It's not often you get a second chance."
"SOOKIE: What do you mean?"
"JOE: I can't tell you how many times I kicked myself for not asking you out that summer. It just seemed like every time I got close, we'd end up talking about the best way to make calves liver or something."
"SOOKIE: Sautéed with caramelized onions."
"JOE: Exactly. Then when I saw you at the Learning Center, it was like fate was saying, ""Here you go, man. Try not to screw it up again."" I guess things just had to happen in their own time."
"SOOKIE: Uh huh, in their own time. Um, could you just. . .uh, stir. . . yeah, I'll be back."
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[Sookie walks up to Lorelai at the front desk.]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Oh, no, sir, I'm afraid we don't offer a complimentary breakfast."
"SOOKIE: [whispers] He thinks it's a date."
"LORELAI: Uh, yes, sir, I realize the Ramada does."
"SOOKIE: [whispers] Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Uh, well, if you like, I could recommend a few places in town. Uh, okay, uh huh, sure. Why don't you talk to your wife and call me back. Okay, bye. [hangs up] Hey, Shields and Yarnell, what's going on?"
"SOOKIE: He thinks it's a date."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Joe, he thinks this is a date."
"LORELAI: Is he crazy?"
"SOOKIE: Exactly. You were there  it's not a date, is it?"
"LORELAI: No. The two of you were gonna go bust Feldster's chops. Busting chops is not a date."
"SOOKIE: That's what I thought, but he keeps saying how he liked me back then and how this is his second chance."
"LORELAI: He's liked you for ten years?"
"SOOKIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Wow. That is some serious Great Gatsby pining."
"SOOKIE: I know."
"LORELAI: You're his Daisy."
"SOOKIE: I am? I'm his Daisy. I'm someone's Daisy."
"LORELAI: It's very flattering."
"SOOKIE: It is very flattering. But I didn't bring it on, did I? I mean, did I flirt?"
"LORELAI: No, you did not flirt. You were talking about Bung."
"SOOKIE: Right. And you can't flirt when talking about Bung, it's impossible."
"LORELAI: He read something into it because he wanted to."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, what's Jackson's gonna say?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, it's a misunderstanding. Jackson will be fine. Just go in there and explain it to Joe."
"SOOKIE: But what do I tell him? He's waited ten years for this. How do you hand out that kind of rejection? I could tell him I've become a lesbian!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, or ""I'm married"" might work."
"SOOKIE: Right, I'm married, good, that's very good."
"LORELAI: It's gonna be fine. Joe's a nice guy with good taste."
"SOOKIE: I'm his Daisy."
"LORELAI: Be happy later."
"SOOKIE: Right. I'm going in. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"[Sookie walks back into the kitchen]"
"JOE: So, at the risk of seeming like Joe the drunken chef, I added some more Port to the Cumberland sauce. Now, just promise to try it."
"SOOKIE: Joe, we need to talk."
"JOE: Wow, you've mellowed. In the old days, you would've just called me an idiot and just dumped it in the trash."
"SOOKIE: It's not that, it's. . .you put in more Port? This is a pheasant sauce, not the punch bowl at a frat party."
"JOE: Just try it."
"SOOKIE: No, no, no, no, no, that's not what I meant to say. It's just. . .there's been a misunderstanding. I thought this thing tonight was just a friends thing, you know, not like a date thing."
"JOE: Oh."
"SOOKIE: Not that going out with you would be bad. Except it would be. . . very, very bad."
"JOE: Wow."
"SOOKIE: But only because I'm married! I meant to say that first. [holds up her hand] See? Last May, I just. . .[realizes she's not wearing her wedding ring] Where's my. . .oh, hang on. [walks over to get her ring] See, this was supposed to be. . .when I hold my hand up, cause otherwise, ""Whatcha doin'?"", right? Okay, here. I take it off when I'm cooking, but, look, there it is, right where it should be, on my finger."
"JOE: You're married."
"SOOKIE: Yes, I am. I hope that's okay."
"JOE: Hey, if your husband's good with it, who am I to complain?"
"SOOKIE: You're not mad?"
"JOE: Why would I be mad?"
"SOOKIE: Because you thought this was a date."
"JOE: I'm not mad. Feeling a little stupid, but not mad."
"SOOKIE: Here, let me give you some money."
"JOE: I didn't spend any money."
"SOOKIE: Well, let me give you some money anyway."
"JOE: Look, the only way I'll be mad is if you throw that sauce out before you try it, okay?"
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"JOE: Tell you what, why don't we make a plan to harass Feldman some other time? You can bring your husband and I'll see if I can get a real date."
"SOOKIE: That'd be fun. Come on, I'll walk you out."
"[they walk to the lobby]"
"JOE: You know, we could even get some of the old gang together."
"SOOKIE: I'll drive."
"JOE: I guess this'll teach me not to wait ten years next time. Anyway, I'll give you a call."
"SOOKIE: Bye Joe."
"[Joe leaves. Lorelai walks up to Sookie]"
"LORELAI: See, he's smiling. I knew it was nothing to get worked up over. You obviously let him down very well, and now maybe you guys can be friends."
"SOOKIE: I'm a whore!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking through the town square]"
"LORELAI: This is silly. I know how to answer a question."
"RORY: This is your first deposition. Grandma's lawyers just want you to be prepared."
"LORELAI: Sample questions, great. It's bad enough I have to give a deposition, now I have to study for it?"
"RORY: Shall we begin?"
"LORELAI: Go ahead."
"RORY: Please describe how your mother runs her household."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, do you remember the rowing scene in Ben Hur?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, did that reference date me? Should I have gone with the ""Express Yourself"" video?"
"RORY: Shall we stop?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, ask me another."
"RORY: Would you say your mother is an easy woman to get along with?"
"LORELAI: No. Next."
"RORY: You're not taking this seriously."
"LORELAI: I am taking this seriously."
"RORY: Well, you can't say that."
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, so you want me to lie."
"RORY: No, you don't have to lie. It's all about how you present the truth. For example, you could have said, ""My mother is a perfectionist."""
"LORELAI: Uh huh. And do you promise to visit Mommy in jail?"
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Okay, then. My mother is a perfectionist."
"RORY: Very good."
"[they reach the diner as Luke walks out]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. Where you going?"
"LUKE: Oh, well, I'm going to Doose's because we are out of food."
"LORELAI: How can you be out of food?"
"LUKE: Well, it starts with the words, ""Hey Jess, you do the ordering this week, okay?"" and it ends with me selling Kirk a lettuce sandwich."
"RORY: We've eaten those."
"LUKE: I'm gonna go pick up some stuff to hold us over til tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Well, get some burgers."
"RORY: And tater tots."
"LORELAI: And pickles."
"LUKE: Okay, hold on a sec. Burgers, tater tots, pickles. You want cheese on the burger?"
"LORELAI: Cheddar."
"RORY: And swiss."
"LUKE: Dessert?"
"LORELAI: Do we have to decide right now?"
"LUKE: I would seriously advise it."
"LORELAI: Pie."
"RORY: Cherry."
"LORELAI: And whipped cream. And dental floss. And paper towels. And People magazine. We're really hungry."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Paris walks into the bathroom. Francie follows her]"
"FRANCIE: Paris, good, I so need to talk to you. [to another girl in bathroom] Are you lost? [the girl leaves] Listen, first of all, I really wanna commend you on your job as president so far."
"PARIS: Thank you."
"FRANCIE: The way you've negotiated on some of those convoluted school issues  mind blowing. I watch in awe."
"PARIS: Uh huh."
"FRANCIE: And that's why this is so hard, because I have major respect for you, and the last thing I ever want is for you to get the wrong impression about my loyalties."
"PARIS: What are you talking about?"
"FRANCIE: [pulls an envelope out of her backpack] These were shoved in my locker this morning, and I didn't know what to do, so I thought to myself, I'll just show them to Paris and I'll explain and she'll understand.'"
"PARIS: Explain what? What is this?"
"[Paris opens the envelope and pulls out some photos of Rory and Francie in the parking garage]"
"FRANCIE: Rory came to me and said she wanted to talk about some things. . .you know, policy, the prom, the senior gift, et cetera. So of course I said, ""why don't we talk about them at the student council meeting with Paris?"" And she said she wanted to do this without Paris. She said Paris is just too wrapped up in that boyfriend of hers to care about any of this. I didn't know what to do, so I went, and then I found these, and I'm just so upset. I mean, I would never intentionally do anything behind your back, Paris. And I promise, the next time Rory tries to get me to, I'm just gonna say, Talk to the hand', you know what I mean?"
"PARIS: Yes, I know what you mean."
"FRANCIE: Are you mad? Say you're not mad. I just couldn't live if I thought you were mad."
"PARIS: No, I'm not mad. [leaves]"
"FRANCIE: Well, thank God for that."
"CUT TO CHILTON GYMNASIUM"
"[Students are standing around in fencing outfits]"
"TEACHER: Okay class, we will begin in five minutes."
"MADELINE: Does your helmet smell? I always get one that smells."
"LOUISE: You'd think the brain trust behind P.E. could come up with some sport that didn't give you helmet hair all afternoon."
"MADELINE: Like badminton."
"LOUISE: Or striptease aerobics."
"RORY: What?"
"MADELINE: It's really big in L.A. You just go through the motions, you don't actually have to strip."
"RORY: Do the other people in the gym throw money at you?"
"LOUISE: Fine, mock, but tell me this  have you ever seen an overweight stripper?"
"RORY: The word no seems so wildly inadequate all of a sudden. Hey, where have you been?"
"PARIS: Washing my hands."
"RORY: Okay."
"TEACHER: All right everyone, take your places. We will warm up with your counter-sixte-riposte-quarte. Melanie, please lead the group."
"MADELINE: Oh my God, there's a hair in mine."
"LOUISE: Just close your eyes and think of England, honey."
"RORY: Doesn't it seem strange to be practicing a sport whose original purpose was to k*ll people? It's like if high schools of the future had teams in a*tillery or high altitude b*mb or something."
"TEACHER: Beginning salute. En garde. Right side advance."
"RORY: You okay?"
"TEACHER: Right side retreat."
"PARIS: Why do you ask?"
"TEACHER: And lunge."
"RORY: You just seem weird."
"TEACHER: Left side advance."
"RORY: Easy there, Paris."
"TEACHER: Left side retreat."
"PARIS: We're fencing Rory, not playing patty cake."
"TEACHER: And lunge."
"PARIS: You know, it's interesting how you think you know someone."
"TEACHER: Right side, quarte lunge."
"PARIS: Trust a person, rely on a person, then turn around one day and realize you'd been had. Ever experience that?"
"TEACHER: Ripost."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: I hate being had."
"RORY: Why are you telling me this? You're not supposed to be parrying that hard."
"PARIS: Gee, I'm sorry. Maybe I should turn around so you can just stick it directly into my back."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"PARIS: I saw the pictures."
"RORY: What pictures?"
"PARIS: You know what pictures."
"RORY: Obviously I don't know what pictures."
"PARIS: The pictures of you and Francie."
"RORY: Me and Francie?"
"PARIS: You and Francie in the parking garage talking about me."
"RORY: Paris, I "
"PARIS: Don't make that face at me!"
"RORY: What face? I'm wearing a mask."
"PARIS: The ""I'm Rory, don't you want to pet me?"" face. I know you two have been meeting behind my back."
"RORY: We haven't. We met once."
"PARIS: Aha, you admit it."
"RORY: Yes, but it wasn't what you think."
"PARIS: Brutus!"
"RORY: Paris, you have to listen to me. Francie wanted to meet, she said she wanted to call a truce. She took those pictures of us, she's setting me up, she's trying to manipulate you."
"PARIS: Of course she is. You think I don't know when someone's trying to manipulate me? But that doesn't change the fact that you met with her behind my back."
"RORY: I was trying to help you."
"PARIS: You were? You mean, in between betraying me and selling me out, you were trying to help me? Gee, you are quite the Renaissance woman, aren't you?"
"RORY: Stop it!"
"PARIS: Make me! Come back here, Gilmore! Come back and fight like a man. [Paris chases Rory around the gym until Rory trips and falls] And the worst part is, you told her about Jamie. I can't believe I ever considered you my best friend."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk to the porch]"
"RORY: I still can't believe it. I can't believe I got sucked in like that."
"LORELAI: Ugh, that Francie is pure evil, so she'll probably wind up president."
"RORY: Paris is so upset. She totally thinks I betrayed her."
"LORELAI: She'll calm down."
"RORY: Paris has never calmed down."
"LORELAI: She'll calm down."
"RORY: I can't believe I was her best friend. I feel awful."
"LORELAI: Look, I'll tell you what. If you wanna make things right, just go back to school tomorrow and let her stab you."
"RORY: Great idea."
"LORELAI: I'm nothing if not full of suggestions."
"RORY: Or full of something."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"RORY: Hey Grandma."
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"EMILY: Come in, it's cold."
"[they walk inside]"
"LORELAI: Do you want me to talk to her? You know, arrange a sit-down?"
"RORY: No, thanks."
"LORELAI: Come on. We'll have it in an Italian restaurant. You'll get up, go to the bathroom  thanks  and come out sh**ting, and then I'll send you to Italy."
"RORY: Well, I do wanna go to Italy."
"LORELAI: Two birds with one stone, my friend."
"[they walk to the living room and sit down]"
"LORELAI: Is everything okay, Mom?"
"EMILY: Of course it's okay. Why wouldn't it be okay?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. You just seem a little quiet."
"EMILY: Do I? I guess I do. I don't really have a lot to say, actually. I know, why don't I read to you instead. [picks up a booklet]"
"LORELAI: Huh, what's that?"
"EMILY: This? Nothing, just your deposition."
"LORELAI: My. . .how did you get "
"EMILY: Shh. Listen, it's fun. Okay. [reads] ""Question  Would you say your mother is a tolerant woman?"""
"LORELAI: Oh boy."
"EMILY: ""Answer  Um, well, sure."""
"LORELAI: What? I said you were."
"EMILY: You said sure."
"LORELAI: Which to most people means yes."
"EMILY: Yes, to most people, it does, but I've heard you say sure, and your sure is always sarcastic."
"LORELAI: I do not have a sarcastic sure. . .do I?"
"RORY: Pick spot on carpet and stare."
"EMILY: ""Question  Why has your mother dismissed maids in the past?"""
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: ""Answer  Different reasons."""
"LORELAI: Well, that's true, right?"
"EMILY: ""Can you expand on that? Answer  Gee, how much time do you have?"""
"LORELAI: Okay, see "
"EMILY: ""I mean, if you guys have a lunch or an afternoon squash game or something. . .you look like the kind of guys who play squash. And hey, why's it called squash? Is it something to do with the fruit? Or vegetable, right? A squash is a vegetable, though if you ask me, it's gross no matter what you call it. Well, anyway, what I'm saying is you might want to clear your afternoon."""
"LORELAI: I was flustered. He was using lawyer tricks."
"RORY: By asking you to expand?"
"LORELAI: Now you decide to pipe in?"
"EMILY: Didn't I tell you this was important, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you did."
"EMILY: So, in spite of the fact that I told you it was important, you couldn't find it in your heart to put aside your personal antagonism toward me for one day and help me out."
"LORELAI: Mom, this is not fair. I said a lot of nice things about you in there."
"EMILY: Oh really? ""Would you say your mother sets impossible goals which people cannot help but fail to reach, thereby reinforcing her already formed opinion of their deficiencies? Answer  Only for her daughter."""
"LORELAI: Okay, not there, but keep flipping."
"MAID: I'm sorry to interrupt, but dinner is ready Mrs. Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Dinner, hey! Dinner's ready. Who's hungry besides me? I'd keep it warm. We're gonna be here awhile. Okay, go ahead."
"EMILY: ""Would you call your mother an extremely critical woman? Long pause."" Why was there a long pause, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Because I was deliberately trying to hurt you, Mom."
"EMILY: ""On a scale from one to ten, what would you rate your mother in terms of compassion for others' feelings?"" Wanna guess what she said?"
"RORY: No, thank you."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Hang on a second, Lorelai. I just want to skip to the Ben Hur reference."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I did."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory sits alone in the cafeteria. A paper airplane that says ""Leper"" lands on her table. She tosses it aside and puts on her headphones.]"
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Jackson walks through the front door]"
"JACKSON: Sookie, I'm home. I got the -"
"SOOKIE: Surprise!"
"JACKSON: What is this?"
"SOOKIE: I made you dinner."
"JACKSON: It smells terrific."
"SOOKIE: Lamb chops with Sicilian olives, rosemary and garlic, and a warm potato and chorizo salad."
"JACKSON: I love lamb chops with Sicilian olives, rosemary and garlic, and a warm potato and chorizo salad."
"SOOKIE: I know."
"JACKSON: What's that?"
"SOOKIE: Beef jerky."
"JACKSON: You made beef jerky for me."
"SOOKIE: And there's cornbread, and fried marshmallow pie for dessert."
"JACKSON: And you have CCR on."
"SOOKIE: Well, you like CCR."
"JACKSON: I know I like CCR, you don't like CCR."
"SOOKIE: Sometimes I like CCR, and tonight I like CCR."
"JACKSON: You cheated on me!"
"SOOKIE: No."
"JACKSON: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: I just flirted accidentally!"
"JACKSON: Turn it off."
"SOOKIE: Let me explain."
"JACKSON: Every time I hear it now, it'll remind me that my wife cheated on me."
"SOOKIE: Flirted  accidentally!"
"JACKSON: You ruined Creedence for me!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch, Rory walks into the living room]"
"RORY: I'm going to bed."
"LORELAI: At nine-thirty?"
"RORY: Yeah, well, going a whole day without talking to anyone is a lot more tiring than you think."
"LORELAI: I hate those girls."
"RORY: It's fine. It was the first lunch that didn't start with a recitation of the calorie content of everything on the table, so actually it was kind of a relief."
"LORELAI: I hate them anyhow."
"RORY: Night."
"LORELAI: Night babe."
"[Rory walks back to her room as the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello?"
"ALEX: Lorelai, it's Alex Lesman. We met at The Learning Center the other day. My friend accidentally asked your friend out on a date."
"LORELAI: Um, right, hi."
"ALEX: How are ya?"
"LORELAI: I'm good."
"ALEX: Fat Sal sends his love."
"LORELAI: Right back at him."
"ALEX: Look, I know this must seem kind of out of the blue. You're probably wondering how I got your number."
"LORELAI: Information?"
"ALEX: No, that would've been far too logical. I actually called your inn. I was gonna leave a message, but this French guy just gave me your home number. Said I shouldn't worry about calling too late, that you usually stay up til three, four in the morning."
"LORELAI: Yeah, don't worry about him, he's getting fired tomorrow. So, what's up?"
"ALEX: Well, I was wondering something."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. . ."
"ALEX: On weekends, I like to go to different coffee shops, try their coffee, look at what they're doing."
"LORELAI: See if there's anything you can steal and possibly disguise as your own?"
"ALEX: Exactly, kind of a low-rent corporate espionage. Anyway, sometimes I'll hit two coffee shops that have surprisingly similar product, and I for the life of me cannot decide which one is better."
"LORELAI: Bummer."
"ALEX: Yes, bummer, so I thought it would really help to have another person there who could help me make these crucial evaluations."
"LORELAI: Interesting solution to a fascinating problem."
"ALEX: So I was wondering what you were doing this Saturday."
"LORELAI: You know, it's funny you should ask me this, because I just happen to be one of the world's foremost coffee experts."
"ALEX: Really?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, it's basically just me and this guy named Chuckles in Brazil."
"ALEX: Sounds like fate. So, what do you say?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"ALEX: Great. Just to be on the safe side, you do know this is a date, right?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I got that."
"ALEX: Good."
"LORELAI: So, you guys come up with a name for your place yet?"
"ALEX: Right now, the top contender is Sludge."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"ALEX: Moving on, my partner likes Regular Joe."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"ALEX: Then again, his name is Joe."
"LORELAI: Well, fancy that."
"ALEX: So, still won't let go of The Mudhouse, huh?"
"LORELAI: Afraid not. What else you got?"
"ALEX: Well, okay, how about Black Liquid Hope Sold Here?"
"LORELAI: See, now you're making some progress."

"OPEN IN LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory are staring at their garage]"
"RORY: Well."
"LORELAI: I'd say three years."
"RORY: I'd say more like four."
"LORELAI: What? It has not been four years since we've stepped foot inside our own garage."
"RORY: It was when we got the Jeep."
"LORELAI: That wasn't. . .yes, it was."
"RORY: And even then, I think we only got as far as opening the door before something flew out and scared you."
"LORELAI: Yes, it scared me while you stood by calmly like Dr. Dolittle chatting with the bat."
"RORY: It was a bat, wasn't it?"
"LORELAI: Wearing an OzzFest T-shit, I believe."
"RORY: Will the man never be able to live that down?"
"LORELAI: Well, Joe Namath will forever be wearing pantyhose."
"RORY: True, very true."
"LORELAI: So, uh, what do we do about the bat cave?"
"RORY: Well, we did promise Lane that her band could rehearse here."
"LORELAI: Yes, we did."
"RORY: And they'll probably need to actually get in there to do so."
"LORELAI: So I guess we're going in."
"RORY: I guess we are."
"LORELAI: All right. On three  one, two, three."
"[They open the garage doors]"
"RORY: Ah!"
"LORELAI: What, what is it?"
"RORY: Those are the boxes from our attic that you were supposed to give away two years ago."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I spent three days boxing all the stuff in the attic and you were going to call a charity and get someone to pick them up."
"LORELAI: I made an appointment, the guy didn't show."
"RORY: He didn't?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't think."
"RORY: Unbelievable."
"LORELAI: Look, I got bored after sitting there two hours, so I left a note saying the stuff was in the garage and he could leave a receipt, and I went to get some coffee."
"RORY: These guys aren't just allowed to go into someone's garage."
"LORELAI: Well, the note said it was okay."
"RORY: Well, how did he know that the note was authentic?"
"LORELAI: I wrote it on Powerpuff Girls stationery. Who'd he think was setting him up, Hello Kitty?"
"RORY: I can't believe how much junk we have."
"LORELAI: Hey, these are  these are souvenirs from our life's journey, girly girl. This is not junk. Okay, this is junk, and that over there is junk. All right, basically everything I'm looking at is, yeah, junk."
"RORY: We're pack rats."
"LORELAI: We're Sanford and Son. Yuck, bye bye. [throws a stuffed ball out of the garage]"
"RORY: Wait! [catches the ball]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Hug-a-World!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Hug-a-World, it's my Hug-a-World."
"LORELAI: Where's the world?"
"RORY: It's faded."
"LORELAI: Oh, wait, I can see something."
"RORY: Canada."
"LORELAI: Canada, nice. Okay."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm throwing it out."
"RORY: You can't throw out Hug-a-World."
"LORELAI: I'm not throwing out Hug-a-World, I'm throwing out Hug-a-Canada."
"RORY: I learned my seven continents on Hug-a-World, don't you remember? We used to squeeze it as tight as we could and then wherever our pinkies would end up, that's where we were going to go together when I grew up."
"LORELAI: Yes, many a trip to Uzbekistan was planned that way."
"RORY: We can clean him up and keep him, can't we?"
"LORELAI: Throw him outside and I'll see what I can do."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: If I clean up Hug-a-World, does that cancel out me not getting rid of the boxers?"
"RORY: I'll consider it a wash."
"LORELAI: How about if I chase it and bring it back?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Hug-a-World would like to see the world."
"RORY: It's moving."
"LORELAI: There's something living there besides Canadians."
"RORY: I hugged it, I hugged it really tight."
"LORELAI: Yes, you did."
"RORY: I have to shower! [runs away]"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, hey, what about the rest of the garage? Rory! Hey, how bout if Lane's band rehearses in the kitchen? We don't use that either."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[There is construction going on outside. Luke tries to take an order over the noise]"
"LUKE: Can I take. . .Can I take. . .What can I get. . . That's it. [goes outside]"
"TAYLOR: I specifically requested a carved arch above the door."
"TOM: It's a blueprint, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Yes, Tom, I know it's a blueprint."
"LUKE: Taylor!"
"TAYLOR: One second, Luke. I know it's a blueprint, Tom, but if I don't see a carved archway here, then I don't expect to see a carved archway there, and if I don't see an archway there, then you won't see a paycheck here. Are we clear?"
"TOM: Get away from my saw, Taylor."
"LUKE: What the hell is going on?"
"TAYLOR: I'm renovating your building. You know that very well."
"LUKE: I also know that the renovation is supposed to be going on over there inside the building."
"TAYLOR: There is plenty of room to move around if you turn sideways."
"LUKE: I'm gonna punch you in the nose."
"TAYLOR: I have every right to make the necessary renovations to the building that I am paying good money to lease."
"LUKE: Taylor, if any other person in this town pulled a stunt like this in front of your market, you'd have them arrested."
"TAYLOR: I have acquired all the necessary permits to do exactly what I'm doing, and all of this has been looked over and approved by the town magistrate."
"LUKE: You're the town magistrate!"
"TAYLOR: And as such, if you have any complaints about me, you may take them up with me."
"TOM: Get him away from my saw."
"LUKE: Get him away from my diner."
"TAYLOR: By the way, Luke, I noticed you hadn't returned any of my lawyer's calls about the lease agreement. Now we have to set up an appointment to see that those papers get signed."
"LUKE: Forget it. I'm not going through any lawyer. You want those papers signed, you pick them up and you walk them over to me. Then, I'll sign them."
"TAYLOR: Luke, this is business. It needs to be done properly and legally."
"LUKE: It's a standard lease form, Taylor. I bought it at Office Depot."
"TAYLOR: All the more reason to have a professional take a little looksee, huh? I mean, there's a reason they say good lawyers make for good neighbors."
"LUKE: Who the hell said that?"
"TAYLOR: Oh, everybody says that. Okay, now back to work. Tom, let's take another look at this archway, shall we?"
"TOM: Get away from my saw, Taylor."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lane and the band are setting up in the garage]"
"LORELAI: I already talked to the neighbors. Just make sure you keep the doors closed, and the music must stop by eight."
"LANE: Don't worry, I have to be home by six."
"ZACH: We'll be done by eight, don't you worry."
"LORELAI: I won't."
"ZACH: Okay, okay, okay, Lorelai, okay."
"LORELAI: Uh, so, um, Rory showed you the key. Uh, you're welcome to anything in the kitchen, which is nothing, but, uh, the water's yours for the taking. Just replace the bottle if it's out."
"ZACH: You ask, I will obey."
"LORELAI: Super."
"BRIAN: I'm out!"
"LORELAI: He's out! I'll get you some more!"
"LANE: Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it."
"LORELAI: Okay. Oh, excuse me. Do you need any help?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Do you need any help, please?"
"RORY: I'm good, Pamela Des Barres."
"LORELAI: When did you turn on Mommy?"
"RORY: What? He's cute."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: And you know, if you latch on now, you're totally entitled to half of everything when he dumps you after he's famous."
"LORELAI: Okay, um, since you don't need any help, simply a new place to live, I'm gonna just go."
"ZACH: Listen. . ."
"LORELAI: You're back, okay, hi."
"ZACH: We're gonna be playing a gig next month, and I think you'd really get into it."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I'd love to get into it, Zach, but see, I have this medical condition where I can't listen to music."
"ZACH: You can't?"
"LORELAI: No. My ears, the hollow tubey thing inside is very tiny and it will literally explode if I listen to anything loud and musical."
"ZACH: That sucks."
"LORELAI: I know. Thanks for the invite, I'm sure it's gonna be great. Uh, so, uh, you guys have a good rehearsal. I'm gonna go on inside and write to Tipper. Great gal. See you guys later."
"RORY: Bye Pam."
"ZACH: She is some kind of fine."
"BRIAN: Zach, some help would be great."
"ZACH: Relax."
"LANE: I still can't believe you guys are letting us rehearse here."
"RORY: You can thank us in the liner notes."
"LANE: Right under our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
"RORY: That's some good billing. So, are you guys actually playing a gig next month?"
"LANE: Abby Berland's birthday party. Her parents are letting her have a band."
"RORY: That'd be great."
"LANE: Cross your fingers she doesn't wreck the car again and her mother doesn't cancel it before we get to play."
"RORY: I'll hide the keys myself."
"BRIAN: Okay, I'm done."
"DAVE: Me too."
"ZACH: Let's do this."
"DAVE: Listen, Lane, we need to talk a sec."
"LANE: Sure."
"DAVE: Now that we finally have a real rehearsal space, we can get serious about the sound."
"LANE: Absolutely."
"DAVE: Which means that I'm gonna need you to really step it up a little."
"LANE: Oh."
"DAVE: I mean, you've got the potential, but you're sloppy. I need a clean roll on the toms but powerful, like Moon."
"LANE: Okay."
"DAVE: I know you're a girl, but I need you to play like a guy."
"LANE: I understand."
"DAVE: And if you can't, if that's too hard. . ."
"LANE: No, that's not too hard. I'll be better, I promise."
"DAVE: Okay."
"[Dave walks away. Rory walks up to Lane]"
"RORY: Okay, please take this the way it's intended, but I am going to kick Dave in the shins repeatedly for the next hour and a half."
"LANE: Why?"
"RORY: Why? Did you hear the way he was talking to you? ""Play like a guy, Lane."" Well, cry like a girl, Dave! What? Why are you smiling like that?"
"LANE: He fooled you."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: We thought the other guys might be catching on about me and Dave so we came up with this plan."
"RORY: That he become a jerk?"
"LANE: Yes. If the other guys see him talking down to me like that, they will totally be thrown off track."
"RORY: Okay, but doesn't it bother you to hear him talk to you like that?"
"LANE: No way. Believe me, he knows I play better, harder, Moonier than any guy they could possibly find, plus I smell better."
"RORY: Okay, as long as you're fine with it."
"LANE: I am, I'm fine with it."
"DAVE: And also Lane, I need four strong b*at, not two strong ones and two whatever ones. You set the tone, Lane. If you suck, we suck."
"LANE: God, he's wonderful."
"CUT TO COFFEE SHOP"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table as Alex walks over with two little coffee cups]"
"ALEX: Okay, now this is the Sumatra blend. It's supposed to be a little sharper than the Colombian."
"LORELAI: You know, this is pretty much what I thought heaven would look like. There might have been a unicorn in the corner, but basically  yeah, this is it. Um, so I've had fifteen of these tiny coffees."
"ALEX: Yes, you have."
"LORELAI: And you're telling me that all this tasting is completely free?"
"ALEX: Yes."
"LORELAI: So I'm a cheap date."
"ALEX: Well, the tasting is free, but I have to promise to stock my coffee chain from this warehouse, so actually this date is costing me about eleven thousand dollars a month."
"LORELAI: Geez, I hope I'm worth it."
"ALEX: So far, so good."
"LORELAI: So you were telling me about Hillary and Jeff."
"ALEX: Right. Well, they live with their mom, but I get them quite a bit. They both recently started soccer because apparently it's the law."
"LORELAI: I know. Rory's still got an outstanding warrant on that one. So, how old are they?"
"ALEX: Six and nine."
"LORELAI: Good ages."
"ALEX: Haven't really hit a bad one yet."
"LORELAI: Me either. Although, with Rory, I think it's gonna be forty-three."
"ALEX: Really?"
"LORELAI: Not sure why, just have a feeling that's the year she's getting the mohawk. Mm, we like sharper. When you guys open your coffee place, this must be on the menu."
"ALEX: Yeah? Mm, that's sharper."
"LORELAI: So, let's see, we've covered work, kids. . .uh, shall we move onto hobbies?"
"ALEX: Not a hobby guy."
"LORELAI: Hallelujah."
"ALEX: Most of the time I'm working, with the kids, or I'm charming the chicks with the coffee. And then a few times a year, I'll go camping or fishing. I actually really love that stuff."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah?"
"ALEX: Absolutely. How about you?"
"LORELAI: Ah, there's a reason they call it the great outdoors, right?"
"ALEX: I was actually thinking of doing a little fishing this Saturday."
"LORELAI: Oh, that sounds like fun."
"ALEX: This great place, beautiful, perfect fishing. You wanna come?"
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"ALEX: I'd love to take you."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, sure. That would be nice."
"ALEX: Great, it's a date."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is a date. It is a fishing date."
"ALEX: Ready to try another? I hear there's one from Peru that comes with a Surgeon's General warning."
"LORELAI: Hey, if that last one didn't k*ll me, nothing will."
"ALEX: Be right back."
"CUT TO BUS STOP"
"[Rory gets off the bus; Lane runs up to her]"
"LANE: Rory! Rory! The numbers are all adding up, the planets are aligning, and I am going to my senior prom!"
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: Yes!"
"RORY: How?"
"LANE: Because I am brilliant. See, my mom was in a good mood today because she made a big sale  a dining room table and eight chairs, none of which matched, that have been hanging around the shop since I was four."
"RORY: Oh, I'm gonna miss those."
"LANE: Get over it. Anyway, I sat her down and I told her that I really wanted to go to the prom. And I know she doesn't approve of such things, but if she lets me go, we will do it her way."
"RORY: But her way would be not to let you go."
"LANE: Yes, she said that also. But then I went on to clarify that if she lets me go, she would get full dress approval, full chaperone approval, I promise not to actually dance at the prom, and whatever boy I go with will be required to attend at least four family dinners before she signs off on him being my escort."
"RORY: Nice move on using the word escort instead of the word date."
"LANE: The subliminal is half the battle, Rory."
"RORY: Go on, go on."
"LANE: So, she sat there, took it all in, and after a really long pause, she looks at me and says, ""Maybe."""
"RORY: You got a maybe from Mrs. Kim."
"LANE: I got a maybe from Mrs. Kim."
"[they walk into the beauty supply store]"
"LANE: Okay, let's start with base."
"RORY: Right. Now, we are talking Dave taking you to the prom, right?"
"LANE: Of course. My mom loves him. Last week she let him sit in our pew."
"RORY: No."
"LANE: She made me move."
"RORY: You've been replaced."
"LANE: I'd be offended if I weren't so busy doing a happy dance. It's all working out so perfectly. By the time she says yes, she'll love him even more and then when I say I wanna go to the prom with him, it'll be like she picked him out herself."
"RORY: You are brilliant. Hey, Kirk, is this waterproof?"
"KIRK: Water-resistant."
"RORY: Thanks."
"LANE: You know, she asked Dave to play at the wedding this weekend."
"RORY: I thought I was the only non-Korean allowed at the Kim family weddings."
"LANE: Don't be hurt. You have been to so many of these weddings, you are an honorary member of the clan now."
"RORY: I appreciate that. So, tell me, your cousin getting married Saturday, what's his story?"
"LANE: James. Very quiet, kind of skulky, couldn't meet anyone here, so his family arranged to have a girl shipped over from the old country."
"RORY: I hope they cut air holes in the box."
"LANE: She doesn't speak a word of English and she's never met him."
"RORY: Hm. Well, then she's gonna need some sparkles."
"LANE: Okay, I think that's it."
"RORY: Let's go. Can you imagine marrying someone you didn't know?"
"LANE: Are you kidding? Used clothes still skeeve me out a little."
"KIRK: Will this be all?"
"RORY: Yes. I like your display Kirk."
"KIRK: It is fun, isn't it? Okay, that's $40.42."
"LANE: Here."
"KIRK: I'm also including a few samples, a facial scrub and a honey mask. Very soothing, very healing."
"RORY: That's very nice."
"KIRK: Thank you for coming, and call me and tell me how you like that mask."
"RORY: We will."
"[they walk outside]"
"LANE: Okay, the wedding's at four, so how about you come over at one and we'll get her ready?"
"RORY: Deal."
"LANE: You know, Rory, I feel good. I feel like everything's going my way this time."
"RORY: I hope so."
"LANE: No, it is, I can feel it. Lane Kim is going to her prom."
"RORY: Maybe."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie is frosting a cake, Lorelai is sitting next to her]"
"LORELAI: Dumb, dumb, dumb."
"SOOKIE: Oh, come on."
"LORELAI: Sure, I fish. I also bodysurf and walk on the moon without a space suit."
"SOOKIE: You were trying to impress him."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"SOOKIE: What ugh? You like him."
"LORELAI: I like him, but I'm not sixteen. I don't lie to guys to make them like me. I just got stuck when he said fishing and camping, and I was trying to be nice and not say, ""Fishing? Great  cold, wet, and smelly. My three favorite things after those witches from Macbeth."""
"SOOKIE: Honey, we all do it. When Jackson and I first started dating, we went to this pickling festival, and he wore a shirt with a giant frog on it. So I'm trying to make conversation and I say, ""Hey, cute frog."" And he says, ""You like frogs?"" and I say, ""I love frogs!"" So, for our six-month anniversary, he gives me a frog figurine."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"SOOKIE: And then when Christmas came, he gave me another frog figurine. And then he told his family what to get me, and all of a sudden. . ."
"LORELAI: Your frog collection!"
"SOOKIE: I'm the frog girl."
"LORELAI: You never told him you don't love frogs?"
"SOOKIE: No. He has the best time buying them for me, so I just let him buy them."
"LORELAI: That's sweet. Maybe I could go fishing. Maybe. Once."
"SOOKIE: Tell me about Alex."
"LORELAI: Well, he owns an iron company. They do gates and statues, big fancy stuff. He's divorced, he has two kids he's crazy about. He's nice, he drinks a lot of coffee. It's all good, it all works."
"SOOKIE: So?"
"LORELAI: So. . .I'm going fishing. I'm the fish girl."
"SOOKIE: Frog girl welcomes you to the club!"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Students are gathering for the student council meeting]"
"LOUISE: I don't know what to do. It's time to break up, but he seems so happy."
"MADELINE: You could date his brother."
"LOUISE: I guess, but that's so been there, done that.'"
"MADELINE: We could switch."
"LOUISE: Isn't that how I got him?"
"MADELINE: Oh yeah. Wow, it really is time to go to college."
"ADVISOR: Rory, where is Paris?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"ADVISOR: She's almost fifteen minutes late."
"RORY: Is she?"
"ADVISOR: All right. Well, perhaps we should start without her. You can convene the meeting."
"RORY: Okay. If everyone will take their seats, we can call this meeting to order. All right, since Paris isn't here "
"PARIS: Paris is here. Couldn't wait to jump in there and take over, could you?"
"RORY: Tell it to the Timex salesman."
"PARIS: My gavel, please? I call this meeting to order."
"RORY: I already did that."
"PARIS: Sorry I'm late, but I had some very important business to attend to. Business which I must now, unfortunately, share with all of you. At the beginning of this year, when we were sworn in as your government representatives, we placed our hand on a bible and we took an oath. An oath that stated that our behavior would be ethically and morally upstanding for as long as we were serving in public office. And that is why it saddens me greatly today to inform you that one of our own has forsaken that holy oath."
"MADELINE: I hate anything that starts with a speech."
"ADVISOR: What are you talking about, Paris?"
"PARIS: I hold in my hand evidence accusing one Rory Gilmore of committing high crimes and misdemeanors."
"RORY: What?"
"ADVISOR: Paris, what's going on here?"
"PARIS: Miss Gilmore has been conspiring with the various factions of this school to weaken the efficacy of this administration."
"RORY: You're really pathetic, you know that?"
"PARIS: You'll have your chance to address these charges when I'm done."
"RORY: What charges?"
"PARIS: First on the list, espionage."
"RORY: Espionage?"
"PARIS: Gathering privileged information and divulging it to the enemy."
"RORY: What privileged information? Prom colors are green and pink, pass it on?"
"PARIS: Next on our list, the most serious crime  treason."
"RORY: I'm sorry I talked about Jamie."
"PARIS: And having a big mouth. That's going on the list also."
"RORY: I can't believe you're taking all of this out on me. What about Francie?"
"PARIS: Francie was not my second in command. Francie was not privy to the innermost workings of my personal. That is, not until you made her privy."
"RORY: Everyone in school saw you walking with Jamie, Paris."
"PARIS: I'm still talking."
"RORY: She already knew!"
"ADVISOR: Enough! We've heard enough."
"PARIS: I move to put to a vote the impeachment of Rory Gilmore."
"RORY: Hey!"
"ADVISOR: Miss Gellar, I'm sorry, but we do not impeach here at Chilton."
"PARIS: Why not?"
"ADVISOR: Because this is a student government."
"PARIS: Well, then, I'd like to put to a vote a resolution to instate the ability to impeach."
"ADVISOR: No."
"PARIS: Then she should resign."
"RORY: I'm not going to resign. You have the problem, you resign."
"PARIS: No, you resign!"
"RORY: No, you resign!"
"PARIS: No, you resign!"
"ADVISOR: No one is resigning."
"LOUISE: Maybe I'll stay with him til Friday and see how it goes."
"MADELINE: That sounds fair."
"ADVISOR: You two can take this argument somewhere else. This is student council. Real school matters are the only things that matter here. Now, Paris, move on."
"PARIS: The swimming pool needs re-plastering. Ideas for fundraising, please."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[A woman with a briefcase walks in]"
"NICOLE: Excuse me? Hi, I'm looking for a Mr. Lucas Danes."
"JESS: Oh, Lucas."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: IRS."
"NICOLE: I'm not IRS. I'm not IRS."
"LUKE: I'm Luke Danes."
"NICOLE: Luke Danes, sorry. Well, hello Luke Danes, I'm Nicole Leahy, I'm Taylor Doose's attorney."
"LUKE: Oh, geez."
"NICOLE: He wanted me to bring "
"LUKE: Yeah, the lease agreements, yes, I know. I told him to walk them over here, but hey, what's the fun of being Taylor, right?"
"NICOLE: I'm sorry if this is a bad time. It certainly won't take me very long."
"LUKE: Nah, I'm fine, whatever. Let's get this over with."
"NICOLE: No problem."
"LUKE: You want some coffee?"
"NICOLE: Yeah, sounds great. I really just need to witness your signature, is all. It's actually just a formality."
"LUKE: In other words, completely ridiculous and unnecessary."
"NICOLE: Uh huh."
"LUKE: Okay."
"NICOLE: Mr. Doose really likes things to be formal. And neat. And in triplicate. He just loves things in triplicate. That's a really good cup of coffee."
"LUKE: Thanks. So, tell me something, what's it like being Taylor's lawyer?"
"NICOLE: Well, actually, I'm not exactly Mr. Doose's lawyer. Or only lawyer. He's one of our select clients, so all of our attorneys deal with him or a rotating basis, it's my month."
"LUKE: My condolences."
"NICOLE: Yeah, my father always told me that which does not k*ll you makes you stronger."
"LUKE: You're gonna be really stronger."
"NICOLE: He's not that bad."
"LUKE: Seriously, if you run into someone pinned underneath a truck, pick it up. It's gonna be a piece of cake. Okay, looks like that's the whole nine yards."
"NICOLE: Great. You and Mr. Doose are officially in business together. Oh, I'm so sorry, I meant that as a good thing."
"LUKE: It's okay."
"NICOLE: Uh, I will let you get back to work. Let me. . ."
"LUKE: No, no, on me."
"NICOLE: Tell you what. It's business, let's let Mr. Doose pay for it."
"LUKE: Even better."
"[Nicole leaves]"
"JESS: Well, that was an interesting show."
"LUKE: What are you yammering about?"
"JESS: Guess Gloria Allred wants to go slumming."
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: She was totally coming onto you."
"LUKE: She was not."
"JESS: Couldn't you hear her panting when you were signing those things?"
"LUKE: Didn't see it."
"JESS: She laughed at your jokes, and we both know there's gotta be some ulterior motive when people laugh at your jokes."
"LUKE: Okay, whatever. Even if there was something, which I'm not saying there was, she's a suit. Not my type."
"JESS: Yeah, especially since she's not a monk."
"LUKE: Oh, I don't go out that much, is that what that's supposed to mean?"
"JESS: Take a look at a calendar. When was the last time you went out on a date? A year, two years ago?"
"LUKE: Last month, wiseass. I went out with Joanna Cooper."
"JESS: You gave her a ride home."
"LUKE: A ride home is the end of a date."
"JESS: Only if you go on a date first."
"LUKE: I'm not gonna discuss this with you."
"JESS: Suit yourself. I have to go meet Rory anyhow. See, I'm gonna go pick her up, spend a few hours actually being with her, then give her a ride home. That's called the end of a date."
"LUKE: Or I could stay open a few hours later which means you're here til ten. That's also called the end of a date."
"JESS: Hopeless."
"LUKE: Bye now."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table looking bored when Luke walks over]"
"LORELAI: Hey, got any good stories?"
"LUKE: Nope, sorry."
"LORELAI: Ah, nothing? No crazy, colorful uncle? Best friend with a funny name?"
"LUKE: Jeff Smith?"
"LORELAI: Skeletons in the family closet? w*r wounds? Funny shaped scars?"
"LUKE: It really throws you off when Rory's late, doesn't it?"
"LORELAI: Big time."
"[Rory walks into the diner]"
"LORELAI: Oh, yay, thank God!"
"RORY: Sorry. Didn't Luke keep you company?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he tried, but really, he's got nothing."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: So what's with all the books?"
"RORY: We are going to fish."
"LORELAI: With these?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: So we throw them in and try to knock the fish out?"
"RORY: I went to the library and got of all their best informational books on fishing."
"LORELAI: Ugh, you're serious."
"RORY: You wanna learn to fish or not? Exciting, huh?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I can barely keep still. [opens book] ""Chapter 1, technique. For deep water fishing, an angler  "" What's an angler?"
"RORY: That would be you."
"LORELAI: Oh, better remember that. Okay. ""For deep water fishing, an angler""  me, again  ""can choose a wire line using a downrigger or a vertical jig. Whatever your technique, the other successful clue to attracting fish is the appropriate lure."" Ooh, what about the sequined top I wore to the Christmas party?"
"RORY: Yes, I think that's exactly what he's talking about."
"LORELAI: ""For bottom feeders, consider smaller, darker patterned lures""  simple, yet elegant  ""while in areas where the forage fish are cicso, you're limited to the larger, more flashy baits."" I am telling you right now, the larger flashy baits are just gonna make me look cheap."
"RORY: Okay, let's review  what do we know so far?"
"LORELAI: I need flashy baits if I'm going to invest in cisco, unless I choose to cast a troll in my downrigger."
"RORY: Hey, that's good."
"LUKE: Doing a little studying?"
"RORY: My mom's leaning how to fish."
"LUKE: You're what?"
"LORELAI: I'm learning how to fish."
"LUKE: Oh, sorry, wrong inflection  you're what?"
"LORELAI: Go away."
"LUKE: Why are you learning how to fish?"
"LORELAI: Um, it's just something I wanted to do. Some friends of mine fish, and I thought if they can do it I can do it."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: And what if I am a really great fisher? Yeah, I mean, what if that's my calling, the thing that I am meant to do? And all this time I've been sitting here with the gift to fish and I am squandering it. It's like if Mozart walked right by the piano store and never played a note."
"LUKE: So you're gonna fish to fulfill your destiny?"
"LORELAI: That's right."
"LUKE: And you're gonna learn to fish to fulfill your destiny from a book?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LUKE: And you sanctioned this?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LUKE: Okay, Thelma, Louise, possibly there's another way to learn to fish."
"LORELAI: The Fishing Channel."
"LUKE: I fish."
"RORY: Oh yeah, we've seen those boots thingies outside drying off."
"LUKE: Those would be called waders."
"LORELAI: And I'm sure I'll be reading about waders soon in one of these cliffhangers here."
"LUKE: If you want, I can show you a few things, get you started, make sure you don't strangle yourself with your own line, the basics."
"LORELAI: Are you sure you don't mind?"
"LUKE: I can come over tomorrow after work."
"LORELAI: Great, thank you. Agh. Just for the record, I don't wanna learn that."
"LUKE: Got it."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory walks into the secretary's office]"
"RORY: I got a note that I was supposed to come see Headmaster Charleston."
"SECRETARY: I'll let him know you're both here."
"RORY: Both?"
"PARIS: Both."
"RORY: Both."
"SECRETARY: Take a seat, please."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am. [sits down next to Paris] So what this time, trying to have me deported?"
"PARIS: Oh, yeah, like I'm the one who called this meeting."
"RORY: I certainly didn't call this meeting."
"PARIS: Save the act for Sundance, you little snitch."
"RORY: I didn't snitch."
"PARIS: Said the weak-kneed turncoat."
"RORY: Nixon's bad seed."
"PARIS: Daughter of Judas."
"HEADMASTER: Ladies, come in please."
"[they walk into the office]"
"HEADMASTER: Have a seat. Chilton student council president and vice president in my office. . . not what I would've expected, I must tell you. There's been quite a stir about you two the past several days. The school is buzzing with the talk of your clashes in student council meetings, your face-offs in the cafeteria, a screaming match at the school newspaper's office."
"PARIS: Excuse me, Headmaster Charleston, in regards to the incident at the Franklin, Ms. Gilmore submitted a piece that was quite poorly researched."
"RORY: It was not poorly researched."
"PARIS: I had to re-edit it and Ms. Gilmore took it very badly."
"RORY: There was nothing wrong with the piece."
"PARIS: And in regards to the student council meeting "
"RORY: Oh, you mean the one where you tried to impeach me because you haven't been properly diagnosed yet?"
"PARIS: If you'll just allow me access to my briefs "
"RORY: You know what, you want me to quit? Fine, I'll quit. I never wanted this stupid job in the first place."
"PARIS: Who forced you to take it then?"
"RORY: You did, because you didn't think you'd get elected unless I ran with you."
"PARIS: That's not true!"
"RORY: It's completely true!"
"PARIS: Shut up!"
"RORY: No, you shut up!"
"HEADMASTER: Enough! This behavior will stop this instant. It is disgraceful, especially from the political leaders of this campus. Now, I'd like to know what is actually driving this recent rash of infighting. Oh, goody, I get to guess. Well, let's see, perhaps you're arguing over the same boy?"
"PARIS: Sure, we're girls, so we could only be arguing about a boy, right? Sexist, white-haired "
"HEADMASTER: Paris, are you muttering?"
"PARIS: No, sorry."
"HEADMASTER: All right, if it isn't a boy, perhaps it's a popularity thing. Someone didn't get invited to someone else's party? Or perhaps this is a power struggle of some sort. No? Well, then I'll stop guessing and start lecturing. Ms. Gilmore, you will not be quitting the student council, is that clear?"
"RORY: Yes, sir."
"HEADMASTER: The student body has elected you and therefore you will fulfill your commitment. And in the future, I would advise you to think long and hard about accepting any responsibility if you intend to run away from it at the first sign of conflict. And Ms. Gellar, you worked very hard to get to the position you hold in this school, and yet now you are willing to throw all that away on petty vendettas and childish antics. Indeed, it makes me wonder. . .if you two can't resolve your issues in this sheltered  some would say pampered  environment, how on Earth will you ever survive in college? As student council officers, you represent Chilton to those inside and outside these hallowed halls. Right now, the world sees us as a group of sniveling, spiteful, vindictive individuals  not really what I'd hoped for, nor is that how I portrayed the two of you in my personal letter of recommendation to Harvard. I would hate to have to write a second letter to the university correcting my errors in judgment. However, I've done it before. Am I making myself clear?"
"RORY: Yes, sir."
"PARIS: Yes, sir."
"HEADMASTER: Delightful. You may see yourselves out."
"[Rory and Paris walk into the hallway]"
"RORY: Well, that was delightful, wasn't it? I'm not sure which is more embarrassing  having Charleston yell at us or knowing we actually had a ""shut up/no, you shut up"" fight in front of him. So, what do you think, Paris? Do you feel as completely rotten as I do?"
"PARIS: No."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Luke is unloading his fishing gear out of his truck. He honks the horn and Lorelai walks out of the house]"
"LUKE: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Hello, sailor, bait your hook for you?"
"LUKE: You look ridiculous."
"LORELAI: I look adorable. No one ever told me that if you fish, you get to buy an outfit. I'll do just about anything if I can buy an outfit."
"LUKE: Well, I'll just let that go by because we have a lot to do here."
"LORELAI: Okay, wait. I'll just get my purse before we go."
"LUKE: Go where?"
"LORELAI: To the lake."
"LUKE: You're not ready for the lake."
"LORELAI: Then what am I ready for?"
"[Luke points to the small inflatable pool he has set up in the yard]"
"LORELAI: Uh! You're putting me in the kiddie lake?"
"LUKE: Gotta crawl before you can walk."
"LORELAI: Oh, this is not at all embarrassing. There's not even fish in it."
"[Luke dumps a bucket of fish into the pool]"
"LUKE: Trout."
"LORELAI: Hey! Aw, they're so cute! Hello, hi boys. And look, they're all ""ooh"" like they're singing in a little trout choir."
"LUKE: I wouldn't get too attached."
"LORELAI: Hi Gomer."
"LUKE: There you go."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't be scared Pinky."
"LUKE: And now there's Pinky."
"LORELAI: Pinky Dowdy from fourth grade. See her eyes darting back and forth, all panicked? She got that way from dodge ball. It's okay, Pinky, nobody's gonna hurt you. Hey Pete, stop crowding Pinky. It's okay, Pinky, just go over there behind Cheryl."
"LUKE: Okay, now that everybody knows each other, take this."
"LORELAI: What's that?"
"LUKE: That's your rod and reel."
"LORELAI: Huh, rod and reel. I don't know if the guys are gonna like this."
"LUKE: Well, we can skip the lesson and just take the trout out for some beers. It's up to you, really."
"LORELAI: No, I'm going to learn."
"LUKE: Okay. I already went ahead and threaded your line through the guides here, and put a hook on it."
"LORELAI: What kind of bait is that?"
"LUKE: It's a cork."
"LORELAI: Remind me not to let you cater any of my parties."
"LUKE: It's to cover the hook. Okay, now, this little metal thing is the bail. It's very important. It keeps your line on the spool here."
"LORELAI: Line on the spool, got it."
"LUKE: Okay, take the rod in your right hand, and you press your right index finger on the line, holding it against the pole. With your left hand, slide the bail over. Now don't let go of your index finger or all the line will spin off your spool. Now, pull the pole back over your shoulder to the ten o'clock position."
"LORELAI: Oh, great, now I gotta go buy a watch."
"LUKE: You flip your wrist forward to two o'clock, at the same time releasing your index finger, casting your line out into the lake in front of you. Now, you try."
"[hands her the fishing pole]"
"LORELAI: Okay. Now, I do something with my right hand, my right index finger, and with the bail and a spool, and pull the thingy. . ."
"[she accidentally casts the line backwards]"
"LORELAI: Oh! Now, that would've been embarrassing if I weren't dressed like this."
"LUKE: Oh, you released at eleven, you're supposed to release at two o'clock. Try again."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Lorelai casts the line again]"
"LORELAI: Ah! Hey, I made it in the pool, I made it in the pool!"
"LUKE: I see that."
"LORELAI: Why aren't you excited?"
"LUKE: I'm very excited."
"LORELAI: Well, jump around or something."
"LUKE: All right, you know, you're going in the pool."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"LUKE: All right, what do you think? Ready to take the cork off and try your luck?"
"LORELAI: Uh, uh, I'm ready, but they're not."
"LUKE: No problem."
"LORELAI: Man, you need a lot of stuff for fishing."
"LUKE: Well, normally, you don't bring your own lake."
"LORELAI: Right, right."
"LUKE: So, tell me why you're doing this."
"LORELAI: Because you told me to."
"LUKE: I mean, tell me why you're learning to fish."
"LORELAI: Oh. I told you, some of my friends are going."
"LUKE: What friends? Sookie?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Is Sookie going fishing?"
"LORELAI: Well "
"LUKE: Or Rory  did Rory suddenly get the overwhelming urge to dig for worms and stand in the middle of a lake at five a.m.?"
"LORELAI: Yes? Okay, fine, I met this guy."
"LUKE: Ah."
"LORELAI: And, uh, he's kind of an outdoorsy guy."
"LUKE: Oh, just your type."
"LORELAI: No, not exactly, but he's nice and, uh, he was talking about fishing, and I think I said something like, Oh, hey, that sounds great', and so he invited me and here I am."
"LUKE: I got it."
"LORELAI: Sorry I didn't tell you."
"LUKE: Why didn't you tell me?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I just felt stupid getting rooked into the thing in the first place, and then. . .plus, you don't wanna hear about my personal life."
"LUKE: So this'll be your first date or. . ."
"LORELAI: Second."
"LUKE: Second date."
"LORELAI: He took me to this coffee tasting place."
"LUKE: Coffee tasting, just your type."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"LUKE: Well, I think that's great."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: Yeah. When are you going?"
"LORELAI: Sunday morning."
"LUKE: Oh. Well, it's hard to be a fisher woman without your own pole. You can borrow one of mine if you want."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I got an extra little tackle box, too. . . if you want."
"LORELAI: That would be great."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Can you do me one more favor?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: Put a cork on your hook."
"LUKE: Sure."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is resting her head on the kitchen table]"
"LORELAI: [from other room] Could you please just make some coffee?"
"RORY: I'm not doing anything for you ever."
"LORELAI: Don't be mad."
"RORY: You set my alarm for 5:15 a.m."
"LORELAI: [walking into the kitchen] I know, and I did it for purely practical reasons."
"RORY: Which are?"
"LORELAI: My alarm is just not as reliable as your scream."
"RORY: You will pay."
"LORELAI: That's fine, honey. Now, coffee?"
"RORY: I am writing this in my ledger of all the crummy things you've done over the years, and when I leave this house, mark my words  you will pay!"
"[doorbell rings]"
"LORELAI: Oh great. It's 5:30 a.m., and I have no coffee in my system."
"[Lorelai answers the door.]"
"ALEX: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"ALEX: [holds up a bag] Coffee and donuts."
"LORELAI: Ah, I like you. Come on in. Right in here. [they walk to the living room] This is Rory."
"ALEX: Hi, I'm Alex."
"RORY: Nice to meet you. Would've been nicer in the daylight, but. . ."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's get going. It's not like the fish are gonna wait for us all day, right? I'll take that coffee now. Thank you. I got it, I got it."
"[Lorelai walks toward the front door]"
"ALEX: Your mom's never been fishing before, has she?"
"RORY: Oh, no, she's a well-seasoned fish k*ll."
"ALEX: Uh huh. I made lunch reservations at the Shahaela Lodge and Spa afterward. Think she'll like that?"
"RORY: She'll love that."
"ALEX: Good. Go back to sleep."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[Guests are mingling before the wedding]"
"MRS. KIM: Min Jae, you lost weight. Look good, not so fat."
"MIN JAE: Thank you."
"[Mrs. Kim sees Lane carrying a tray of water glasses]"
"MRS. KIM: What is that?"
"LANE: The bride's thirsty."
"MRS. KIM: Regulate the water. Once the dress is on, that's it  must remain standing."
"[Lane walks over to Dave]"
"LANE: Hi."
"DAVE: Hi, and hi."
"LANE: Uh, this will not be the mental image you carry around of me the rest of the week."
"DAVE: No, it won't. Hold on, I just saw the back. Yes, it will."
"MRS. KIM: Why aren't you upstairs? It's not right to leave the bride alone on her wedding day."
"LANE: Uh, Rory's up there, Mama, and I'm going up there right now. Dave Rygalski was just wondering where to set up."
"MRS. KIM: David, hello."
"DAVE: Hello, Mrs. Kim. The place looks wonderful."
"MRS. KIM: Thank you. Come, sit here. This is Ho Kyung, she'll sing with you."
"DAVE: Hi."
"MRS. KIM: Watch the high notes, she's a runner."
"CUT TO LANE'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory is fixing the bride's hair when Lane walks in]"
"LANE: How's it going?"
"RORY: I like it, but I'm not the one getting married. [to bride] Um, your hair, do you like it?"
"[Lane asks her in Korean, and the lady responds in Korean]"
"LANE: Too much for me."
"RORY: Oh, I found the Mrs. Kim-approved makeup in the drawer, but let me tell you, since the last wedding, it has developed a smell."
"LANE: A what? Oh boy."
"RORY: As I said, a smell."
"[Lane retrieves some makeup from under her floorboard]"
"LANE: Well, I've got the good stuff right here, right next to the Peggy Lee."
"RORY: Seems appropriate."
"LANE: I thought so. Shall we?"
"RORY: Unh unh, the foot stool."
"LANE: Whoa. All set. So, Dave's here."
"RORY: He is, huh?"
"LANE: I still can't believe he's willing to do all this just to go out with me."
"RORY: Well, hey, where else can he find a decent, pretty, smart girl who can recite the entire encyclopedia of rock in 5/8 time?"
"LANE: Nowhere, I guess."
"RORY: I'm really happy for you guys."
"LANE: Thanks. I'm really happy for you and Jess, too."
"RORY: Thanks. You know it's okay, right?"
"LANE: Not following."
"RORY: It's okay not to like Jess."
"LANE: I said I was happy for you."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: God, I'm such a jerk."
"RORY: You're not. Look, we're not always going to like the same things. Like, you like Smashing Pumpkins and I don't."
"LANE: But that's only cause you're close-minded and blind."
"RORY: What can I say? They're not my angst."
"LANE: Besides, it's not like I don't want to like Jess. I can't help it. As your best friend, I'm very protective of you."
"RORY: You could try giving him a second chance."
"LANE: I could. I should. I will. Um, hey, maybe we can all go out sometime together as a group, you know, you, me, Dave, Jess."
"RORY: Absolutely, we should do that sometime."
"LANE: Great. [the door starts to open] Incoming!"
"[Rory pushes the makeup off the vanity as Mrs. Kim walks into the room]"
"MRS. KIM: What's going on in here?"
"LANE: Nothing, Mama."
"RORY: I fell off my chair."
"LANE: Oh, well, don't."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am."
"MRS. KIM: She looks very beautiful. Must've gotten a good night sleep."
"[Mrs. Kim leaves the room]"
"RORY: How many people do you think have gotten married here over the years?"
"LANE: I counted once off the guest book  forty-six."
"RORY: Wow. What happened to that one, Min Cha? She married a real mean guy."
"LANE: Wan Nam. Didn't I tell you about them?"
"RORY: No."
"LANE: Well, Min Cha put up with seven years of Wan Nam telling her she was stupid and ordering her to cook all his meals. Then one day, he was in the kitchen looking for his lunch and she just snapped. Took a carrot peeler and turned on him."
"RORY: A carrot peeler?"
"LANE: You can get those things pretty sharp. Anyway, she just came at him and started peeling. The neighbors called the police. They showed up and Wan Nam was just standing there all peeled."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LANE: He didn't press charges, but now he makes all his own meals, sleeps in a locked separate room, and keeps the cutting board by his bed for protection. Still married, though."
"RORY: Wow."
"LANE: Everybody's still married. It's like a factory system here. They all come to the weddings, find a spouse, get married and stay that way til they die."
"RORY: They mate for life, like the loons."
"LANE: You know, this may be the last wedding for a long time, though."
"RORY: How come?"
"LANE: Well, all my cousins in their twenties and thirties are married. James was the last one."
"RORY: Wow. It feels like we've had at least two of these every year since I can remember."
"LANE: Elementary school, when we met."
"RORY: Elementary school, when we met, yeah."
"LANE: Well, we do have some distant relatives left. Maybe we can go to one of those weddings. You know, when we come home from college on break or something."
"RORY: Well, then, we should definitely keep the makeup."
"LANE: We definitely should."
"RORY: And who knows, maybe the next Kim wedding we do makeup for will be yours."
"LANE: Too scary, don't freak me out."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LANE: So, what do you think, eye shadow?"
"RORY: Why not? Let's do it. Peeled to death  that's a bad way to go."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke looks out the window and sees Taylor talking to his lawyer. They wave to each other.]"
"LUKE: [to customer] Here you go. We'll top that off for ya. [to Jess] Coffee over here."
"JESS: Where you going?"
"[Luke walks out of the diner]"
"LUKE: Uh, Miss Leahy?"
"NICOLE: Yeah? Mr. Danes, how are you?"
"LUKE: Good, good, and it's Luke."
"NICOLE: Okay, Luke. What can I do for you?"
"LUKE: I wouldn't cross there."
"NICOLE: Why not?"
"LUKE: Well, Taylor's a stickler about jaywalking and he's town magistrate. I'd hate for you to be disbarred."
"NICOLE: Well, that would be a bad way to end a career, thank you."
"LUKE: Sure. So, uh, did the lease forms all work out? I mean, was my signature okay? Cause sometimes I'm in a kind of a hurry and my hand just takes off without me."
"NICOLE: Your signature seemed very steady."
"LUKE: Good, good, cause you never know."
"NICOLE: Well "
"LUKE: Listen, I was thinking about that cup of coffee you had at my place the other day. I felt bad making Taylor pay for it  not that I ever feel bad sticking it to Taylor. I just thought it might get you in trouble with a client. I'd hate to see you disbarred again."
"NICOLE: To be honest, I actually paid for the coffee myself."
"LUKE: Oh, oh, well, then at least let me pay you back for it."
"NICOLE: You wanna give me seventy-five cents?"
"LUKE: No, no, no, uh, what I meant was  ah, what the hell? Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?"
"NICOLE: Yeah."
"LUKE: Really?"
"NICOLE: I'd love to have dinner with you."
"LUKE: Great. Okay, uh, well, I have your card."
"NICOLE: Mmhmm."
"LUKE: Why don't I give you a call this week and we'll make that happen."
"NICOLE: Sounds good."
"LUKE: Yeah, sounds good. So, see ya. Watch those crosswalks."
"NICOLE: Thanks, I will."
"[Luke walks back into the diner]"
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: I said nothing."
"LUKE: Well, don't."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[The wedding has started.]"
"PRIEST: [speaks Korean to bride]"
"BRIDE: [answers in Korean]"
"PRIEST: [to groom] And do you vow to uphold the principles of the seventh commandment as set out in Exodus 20:14?"
"JAMES: I do."
"PRIEST: [speaks Korean] [pause] And so, in the Glory of God, I pronounce you husband and wife."
"RORY: That was nice."
"LANE: Yeah, it was really nice"
"MRS. KIM: Reception at Elks Lodge. Two hundred guests. Food goes fast. Let's move."
"RORY: I can't believe that's the last time I'll hear your mom say that."
"LANE: So, are you coming to the reception?"
"RORY: Oh, no, I was actually going to "
"LANE: Go meet Jess."
"RORY: Yeah. Are you mad?"
"LANE: No. You know, he can come to the reception with you if. . . he's not really the reception kind of guy, is he?"
"RORY: Not really. Not yet, anyway."
"LANE: We'll work on that."
"RORY: Yes, we will."
"LANE: Okay, tell him hi for me."
"RORY: I will. Tell Dave hi for me."
"LANE: I will."
"RORY: Bye."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Rory leaves]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: Yes, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: This is Young Chui."
"LANE: Hi."
"YOUNG CHUI: Hi."
"MRS. KIM: He will take you to the prom."
"LANE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: Young Chui works for his father who builds Adventist hospitals. Young Chui will go to college at Loma Linda University. Then he will return to work for his father building Adventist hospitals. Now, put your coat on. Young Chui and his parents will drive you to Elks Lodge. [walks away]"
"LANE: Mama! [to Young Chui] I'm sure you're very nice."
"[Lane follows Mrs. Kim to the kitchen]"
"MRS. KIM: [to wedding guests] Not a bus stop, door's that way."
"LANE: I have to talk to you."
"MRS. KIM: Get your coat, we have to go."
"LANE: No."
"MRS. KIM: No?"
"LANE: I can't go to the prom with Young Chui."
"MRS. KIM: Why not? I thought you wanted to go to the prom."
"LANE: Yes, I do wanna go to the prom."
"MRS. KIM: I thought you say I could approve the boy you go to the prom with."
"LANE: I did say that, but -"
"MRS. KIM: Well, I found the boy, I approve the boy, now you go to the prom with the boy."
"LANE: Mama, um, I'm sure  I'm sure Young Chui's very nice and I'm so grateful you're letting me go to the prom, but the thing is  I like someone else."
"MRS. KIM: Someone else?"
"LANE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: Someone else who?"
"LANE: Someone else who's been a good friend to this family. Who's proven himself to be of high moral character, someone who you yourself feels is worthy. So worthy, in fact, you let him sit in our pew at church."
"MRS. KIM: Who  who did I let sit in our pew?"
"LANE: Dave Rygalski."
"MRS. KIM: The guitar player?"
"LANE: I know, crazy, right? I can hardly believe it myself because, to be quite honest with you, when I first met him, when you hired him to play at Thanksgiving, well, I just didn't like him at all. He bugged me, actually. But the more you liked him and trusted him, the more I saw the good in him, the God in him, actually, and now I'm convinced. . . he's the boy I want to take me to prom."
"MRS. KIM: He's not Korean."
"[cut to front hallway]"
"DAVE: Lane? Hey, Lane? Is everything all right?"
"LANE: You're not Korean."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: I'm home!"
"LORELAI: [from upstairs] Upstairs, bathroom!"
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS BATHROOM"
"[Lorelai is watching a fish swim in the bath tub; Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hey. [sees the fish] Oh, no."
"LORELAI: Isn't she cute?"
"RORY: What happened?"
"LORELAI: The cork fell off my hook and Jayne Mansfield over here bit."
"RORY: Jayne Mansfield."
"LORELAI: Not the brightest fish in the pond, but she's awfully pretty."
"RORY: You caught a fish."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: And you brought it home."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: How are you gonna take a bath?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: How long is it gonna live?"
"LORELAI: Hard to say."
"RORY: What are you gonna feed it?"
"LORELAI: See, this is why I don't fish."
"RORY: She is kinda cute."
"LORELAI: And she has a great tail swish."
"RORY: So, other than bringing home a pet, how was fishing?"
"LORELAI: Good. The lake was beautiful, snowy and sparkly, and right down the road from the Shahaela Lodge and Spa."
"RORY: I knew that."
"LORELAI: How could you already know that?"
"RORY: Alex told me when you guys left."
"LORELAI: Two dates with this guy and you're already in cahoots with each other."
"RORY: Ah, what can I say? I'm wily."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: So, are you going out with him again?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: Camping?"
"LORELAI: Unh unh."
"RORY: Good. So do you think maybe we should try to rehabilitate her and send her back into the wild?"
"LORELAI: Unfortunately, I think she's already domesticated. Baths and scented candles."
"RORY: We'll just have to keep her."
"LORELAI: Maybe we can train her to do tricks."
"RORY: Tomorrow. Night Jayne."
"LORELAI: Night Jayne."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Richard and Emily are sitting in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Mom, I swear, it was Aunt Maureen."
"EMILY: Aunt Maureen would never hike up her skirt in public."
"LORELAI: She would after half a gallon of eggnog."
"EMILY: Richard, who was the one who got drunk at our Christmas party and hiked up her skirt in front of the Town and Country photographer?"
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, did you say something?"
"LORELAI: I don't know about you, Mom, but I've never felt so fascinating in my entire life."
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: I'm so sorry I'm late. Hi Grandma, Hi Grandma."
"RICHARD: Hello Rory."
"LORELAI: Oh, now he closes the paper."
"RORY: Hey, Mom, I stopped by the bookstore on the way here."
"LORELAI: You got them?"
"RORY: I got them!"
"EMILY: Got what?"
"LORELAI: Rory and I are starting to plan our Europe trip."
"RORY: The day after graduation, we are gone."
"RICHARD: Well, that sounds very exciting."
"EMILY: Lorelai, what are these?"
"LORELAI: Those are guidebooks."
"EMILY: ""Europe Through the Backdoor."" ""The Rough Guide to Europe."" What kind of guidebooks are these?"
"LORELAI: The cheap kind."
"RORY: They have all the good information about backpacking and staying in hostels."
"EMILY: Backpacking and staying in hostels?"
"RICHARD: Who's backpacking and staying in hostels?"
"LORELAI: We are."
"[Emily and Richard laugh]"
"EMILY: No, you're not."
"RICHARD: What a ridiculous thought."
"RORY: We are. We're going to backpack around Europe."
"EMILY: Yes, I know, it's fun to tease your grandmother, dear. They're going to backpack across Europe, Richard."
"RICHARD: I heard, sounds delightful. Perhaps we should join them."
"EMILY: That sounds wonderful. Tomorrow I'll go out and buy some cutoffs."
"LORELAI: Guys, we're not kidding."
"EMILY: You're telling me you're seriously going to traipse across Europe with your possessions strapped to your back and sleep in a room with thirty other people?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RICHARD: No."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"RICHARD: It's not safe. I forbid it. Call our travel agent."
"RORY: But we want to be spontaneous. Jump a train to Paris, head off to Spain."
"LORELAI: Oh no, it's raining in Spain. But since the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. . ."
"RORY: Looks like Italy for us!"
"LORELAI: Mamma mia!"
"RICHARD: You can still travel around aimlessly and stay in a decent hotel."
"LORELAI: We wanna do it cheap."
"EMILY: We'll pay."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Grandma, it's going to be fun, really."
"LORELAI: Kids do this all the time."
"EMILY: Yes, but you're not a kid, you're a grown woman. What are people going to think when they see a grown woman bunking down with a bunch of twenty-year-olds?"
"LORELAI: Well, if the twenty-year-olds are cute, they'll probably think, ""Lucky!"""
"RORY: Grandma, don't be upset. It really is going to be great."
"EMILY: [reads from book] What's so traumatic about a night without a bed anyway? My survey shows those who have had the opportunity to be a refugee for a night have their perspectives broaden and actually enjoy the experience."" Richard, this book is encouraging them to sleep in a park like a squirrel."
"LORELAI: It's okay, Mom."
"EMILY: My first trip to Europe, I went to Paris and stayed at the Ritz."
"LORELAI: Well, I tell you what, if it'll make you happy, we'll go to Paris and eat out of their dumpster."

"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[The construction crew is working in front of the soda shop]"
"TOM: All of this goes in there. Let's move, we're getting backlogged."
"DEAN: Tom, I brought over the nails you asked for."
"TOM: Good. Get the guy's lunch orders, will ya?"
"DEAN: Already done."
"TOM: You're a good kid, Dean. You hardly bug me at all."
"DEAN: High praise."
"TOM: Yeah, yeah, go, get the food. And don't forget the pickles."
"DEAN: I wouldn't dare."
"TOM: Oh, what do I gotta say to get this crap inside where it belongs? You got a language I'm not privy to? Cause I'm a fast learner."
"MISS PATTY: Dean-o, Dean-o, Dean-o. If you grow any taller, I'm gonna have to get myself some mountain climbing equipment."
"DEAN: You're getting dangerous to even walk near, you know that, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: I've been told."
"DEAN: You looking for Mr. Doose?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, precious, no. I'm just looking."
"DEAN: Ah."
"MISS PATTY: Yeah."
"DEAN: Okay. Well, uh, enjoy."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, I always do. Ahh."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is leaning on the counter, reading a book]"
"JESS: Move."
"LUKE: What? Oh, sorry."
"JESS: What's that?"
"LUKE: It's nothing."
"JESS: You reading?"
"LUKE: It's nothing."
"JESS: I never see you reading."
"LUKE: Will you just. . .I read."
"JESS: What are you reading?"
"LUKE: I read, I read."
"JESS: What do you read?"
"LUKE: Invoices, expiration dates."
"JESS: I stand corrected. [takes Luke's book]"
"LUKE: Hey!"
"JESS: ""Hidden Romantic Gems of the Restaurant World."" Well, well, well."
"LUKE: I would like my property back, please."
"JESS: Planning something special?"
"LUKE: No, nothing special. I'm just taking Nicole to dinner on Friday and I wanna find a place."
"JESS: A place you don't normally go to?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"JESS: So a special place."
"LUKE: Will you stop saying that word, please? And yes."
"JESS: Find anything good?"
"LUKE: Every single description in here talks about tablecloths and dish design, nothing about the food."
"JESS: You are really going through an awful lot for this lawyer."
"LUKE: She's not a lawyer. I mean, yes, she's a lawyer, but she's also a lady, and a very nice lady who probably expects good food with her fancy plates and sparse yet elegant décor."
"JESS: You're pathetic when you're in love."
"LUKE: I'm not in love, I'm dating. This is what you do when you're dating."
"JESS: It's not what I do when I'm dating."
"LUKE: Well, Rory's a lucky girl. Work. I'm going upstairs."
"JESS: Fine, but if a horse-drawn carriage shows up here, my throwing up will be eternal."
"[Dean walks up to the counter]"
"DEAN: I gotta place an order."
"JESS: Talk into the clown."
"DEAN: I am."
"JESS: What do you want?"
"DEAN: Six burgers, three with cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss. Two plain, one with chili, cheese and onions on the side. Your memory's that good?"
"JESS: You're screwing with me."
"DEAN: I'm placing an order."
"JESS: For all of Connecticut?"
"DEAN: For the construction crew next door."
"JESS: Oh, you're Taylor's errand boy now."
"DEAN: And you're Taylor's waitress."
"JESS: Say that a little closer."
"DEAN: I thought you had a girlfriend."
"JESS: Give me your order and get out."
"DEAN: Service with a smile. Uh, six burgers, three cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss. Two plain burgers, one chili burger with cheese and onions on the side. Three ham on ryes - one mayo, one mustard, one combo. A combo means mustard and "
"JESS: I know what a combo means."
"DEAN: Sorry, guess that confused look is just how your face is."
"JESS: Do you wanna talk about this outside?"
"DEAN: Just as soon as I'm finished. Uh, four hot dogs. Two egg salads on white. One chicken salad on wheat. A chef's salad with ranch. Five fries. Five onion rings. Two chips. Extra pickles."
"JESS: On what?"
"DEAN: Excuse me?"
"JESS: What are the extra pickles on?"
"DEAN: On the side."
"JESS: On the side of what? On the side of the burgers, on the side of the sandwiches, or on the side of the road where the ditch I'm gonna dump your body into is?"
"DEAN: Just make sure there's enough for everyone."
"JESS: Fine."
"DEAN: Aren't you gonna read it back?"
"JESS: Nope."
"DEAN: Okay, but these men were hired by Taylor, which means if they aren't satisfied with their orders, they will send them back. And they will continue to send them back until they are happy, which means you could be making this order until you die."
"JESS: Six burgers, three with cheese  two cheddar, one Swiss."
"DEAN: Slower, please. I'm checking them off as we go."
"JESS: Two plain burgers, one chili with cheese and onion on the side."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is at the front desk on the phone]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hey, it's your party, we just want you to be happy. Okay. No problem. All right, I'll talk to you then. [hangs up] Ridgemont called."
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: He's changing his mind about the theme for his retirement party again."
"MICHEL: No!"
"LORELAI: We have to call the florist."
"MICHEL: But this is the fourth theme he's picked. He had the fishing one, and the Kentucky Derby with the chocolate horsies, and the Tibet with the Richard Gere pictures everywhere."
"LORELAI: I know."
"MICHEL: And he promised that the golf would be the last one."
"LORELAI: Well, he decided that golf was dull and he doesn't want to be remembered as dull."
"MICHEL: Would he like to be remembered as limping, because I can be a fabulous help with that."
"[They walk to the dining room, where workers are decorating the room in a golf theme]"
"LORELAI: Hey, guys. . ."
"[Everyone groans]"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."
"MICHEL: Here's an idea  it's a retirement party, yes? Okay. So what happens after you retire? You die."
"LORELAI: He changed his mind."
"LANE: Again?"
"MICHEL: So, why don't we dig a big hole, throw him in, hand everybody a shovel, they take turns covering him up. We go inside, have dinner, the wife gets used to eating alone. . ."
"LORELAI: We are not going to bury him alive."
"MICHEL: Well, fine then. What is the new theme?"
"LORELAI: He is calling me back at four."
"RORY: I got the flags and. . .he changed his mind again."
"LANE: He's worse than my mother at the Glory of Easter T-shirt stand."
"LORELAI: You kept the receipt, I hope."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: Good God, this party is gonna be the death of me."
"MICHEL: Or someone."
"LORELAI: Go call the florist."
"RORY: You're stressed."
"LORELAI: You're observant."
"RORY: Well, I was going to save this for later, but you look like you need it now."
"LORELAI: What's that?"
"RORY: I have been cordially invited to Sherry Tinsdale's C-section."
"LORELAI: No way!"
"RORY: [reads from invitation] Friday, February seventh, six o'clock p.m. Join the girls for a toast, a hug, a wave to the mommy as they wheel her off, dinner at Sushi Sushi, and then back to the hospital for a formal viewing of brand-new baby Georgia. RSVP at your earliest convenience. P.S. -- gifts are not necessary, but always appreciated."
"LORELAI: I don't even know where to start."
"RORY: I knew you would like it."
"LORELAI: You have to RSVP to a C-section."
"RORY: And bring a gift."
"LORELAI: I wonder if Laura Mercier makes Demerol."
"RORY: You wanna keep it?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, please."
"RORY: But don't lose it. I need the phone number."
"LORELAI: So, are you going?"
"RORY: Well, I don't know. I mean, I know it's weird, but I kind of wanna see Georgia. She's sort of my sister."
"LORELAI: She's more than sort of your sister."
"RORY: I just think it would be cool to meet her the night that she's born. It's a good story to talk about."
"LORELAI: You should go."
"RORY: I should, shouldn't I?"
"LORELAI: And you should take pictures and wear a hidden microphone cause I wanna hear everything."
"RORY: I'll see what I can do."
"LORELAI: Oh, sh**t."
"[Lorelai walks to the kitchen, where Sookie is frosting a golf ball cake]"
"LORELAI: Sook. . ."
"[Sookie flips the cake into the garbage can]"
"SOOKIE: God!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the house with boxes of Beanie Babies]"
"RORY: I just need to go on record that a grown man should not throw himself a Beanie Baby retirement party."
"LORELAI: Just hold your breath this one actually takes."
"RORY: And how is Sookie supposed to plan a Beanie Baby menu?"
"LORELAI: Lots of beans."
"RORY: I think this is ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Angel face, you need to learn that there are going to be times in your life when you have to do ridiculous things for money. If you're Adrian Zmed, that includes everything that ever happens in your whole career. [sees a box on the porch] Oh Rory, come on. Did you order from Amazon again? 'Cause we're going to get your books their own house."
"RORY: I didn't, I swear."
"LORELAI: It's from my mother."
"RORY: What is it?"
"LORELAI: It's heavy. Must be her hopes and dreams for me."
"RORY: I thought she discarded those years ago."
"[they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Just drop the Beanies by the door. [reads note attached to the box] ""Girls, here are some travel books I stumbled across in your father's study. I thought they could help in the planning of your European adventure."" She's insane."
"RORY: We have travel books."
"LORELAI: No, sweetie, these aren't our kind of travel books. These are Paris and Nicky Hilton's kind of travel books."
"RORY: [pulls some books out of the box] ""Selected Hotels of Europe,"" ""Hotels, Restaurants and Inns of Great Britain and Ireland, 1986"", ""Myra Waldo's Travel and Motoring Guide to Europe, '78."""
"LORELAI: Wow, these will be an enormous help in planning our trip. Hey, you wanna go see the Berlin Wall?"
"RORY: Sounds great."
"LORELAI: My God, I remember these books. I think the only person in my house who ever read them was me."
"RORY: This hotel is five hundred dollars a night."
"LORELAI: Five hundred dollars a night twenty years ago."
"RORY: What could a hotel possibly have that would make it five hundred dollars a night?"
"LORELAI: An English menu?"
"FLASHBACK  ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Young Lorelai and Christopher walk through the front door]"
"LORELAI: Christopher, stop it, I'm trying to open the door. Graceful and lovely they enter."
"CHRISTOPHER: Is she home?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Mom, are you home?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Mom, are you home?"
"LORELAI: Shh, she'll hear you."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, she likes me."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's right. Mom, it's me, Lorelai, I'm home! I'm home and I'm taking my sweater off. I'm taking my sweater off and dropping it on the floor. I'm dropping it on the floor and walking away from it. I'm walking away from it and leaving it on the floor, and in two years I'm gonna register Democrat. Looks like no Emily."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where's Sofia?"
"LORELAI: Fired."
"CHRISTOPHER: Already."
"LORELAI: She touched the Baccarat unicorn."
"CHRISTOPHER: My God, is she insane?"
"LORELAI: Apparently so."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so, to recap, there's no Emily and there's no Sofia."
"LORELAI: And there's no supervision whatsoever. What will we do?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Let's celebrate."
"LORELAI: Celebrate what?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No more midterms."
"LORELAI: Hear, hear."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I say that we drink to it."
"LORELAI: Hear, hear."
"CHRISTOPHER: Scotch, vodka, or gin?"
"LORELAI: Hear, hear."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay."
"LORELAI: And put a cherry in it. It looks like the Gilmores are planning a trip again."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where to this time?"
"LORELAI: Someplace fabulous where they'll stay at a fancy hotel with a lot of other rich Americans so they won't have to talk to anyone who actually lives in that country."
"CHRISTOPHER: ""Myra Waldo's Travel and Motoring Guide to Europe."" Hello Myra."
"LORELAI: Oh God, I hope they go over Christmas. That would be as holly jolly as it gets. Smooth."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, guess what I decided  I'm not gonna go to college."
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm taking a year and I'm going to Europe. I'm gonna backpack, train it, sleep on a bench, see the world."
"LORELAI: And you've told Straub and Francine about your big plans, I'm sure."
"CHRISTOPHER: Ah, it doesn't matter."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm outta here the second that diploma's in my hand."
"LORELAI: Sounds good."
"CHRISTOPHER: You're coming with me."
"LORELAI: Oh, I am?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yup."
"LORELAI: I'm sleeping on a bench? Okay, how does that picture look to you, cause to me it looks like a big no."
"CHRISTOPHER: Fine, you we get a room for, and then I'll just sleep on the bench outside."
"LORELAI: Much better arrangement."
"CHRISTOPHER: So you'll go?"
"LORELAI: Christopher, you're supposed to go to college. I'm supposed to go to college. Then you're supposed to join your dad's firm where you'll get a corner office and big stick to shove up your butt."
"CHRISTOPHER: Change of plans."
"LORELAI: You can't just change the plans. The plans came over on the Mayflower."
"CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Lor. Let's get out of here, let's get away from this place. Let's take Myra and just bolt. Leave a note on the dining room table. ""Dear Richard and Emily, I don't belong here, I'm going somewhere else, I'll call you when I get there. Love, Lorelai.' How does that sound?"
"LORELAI: Well, the word ""whoopee"" comes to mind."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, then, it's a plan."
"LORELAI: It's a plan."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE (PRESENT)"
"[Lorelai and Rory are still looking through the guidebooks]"
"RORY: Hey, I want to sleep amongst thirteenth century tapestries and chocolates made by local artisans."
"LORELAI: Okay, then, it's settled. We're not staying at any place that wasn't built for Napoleon the third's doctor or doesn't have a Chagall in the bathroom."
"RORY: Hear, hear."
"LORELAI: Now we just have to figure out how we're gonna pay for it. Hey, how good's your organ grinding?"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Students are gathered in a meeting room]"
"MADELINE: I called last night and I asked her to talk me through the Korean w*r and she said she was busy."
"LOUISE: Oh, she's definitely got a boyfriend."
"MADELINE: I know."
"LOUISE: Well, I for one think it's about time."
"MADELINE: I agree."
"LOUISE: It wasn't healthy, all that non-dating."
"MADELINE: It definitely didn't help that whole skin thing she was going through."
"LOUISE: How come she didn't tell us?"
"MADELINE: I think she just wanted to make sure it was gonna take."
"LOUISE: So, tell us, what's this Jamie like?"
"RORY: You know, I really don't feel like talking about Paris right now. Or ever."
"MADELINE: Oh, come on, you know him, we don't."
"LOUISE: Is he sexy?"
"MADELINE: Does he have a good car?"
"LOUISE: How's the trust fund?"
"MADELINE: How's the profile?"
"LOUISE: Will the prom pictures work?"
"MADELINE: How are his friends?"
"LOUISE: Yes. Is there spin-off potential? [Paris walks in] Whoops."
"MADELINE: Bye."
"PARIS: Okay, everyone, gather around. I have in my hand the 2002 Franklin Yearbook photos. I got copies for everyone, so let's leave the Barney's clearance sale reenactment for another day, shall we? And, please take note of the fact that the idea of posing under the new school banner was a major, major success."
"RORY: Um, Paris."
"PARIS: Yes?"
"RORY: I'm sneezing."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: In the picture. I'm sneezing and my head is turned."
"PARIS: Oh, yeah, I noticed that, but every picture had something wrong with it and I had to pick the one that was the best for the largest number of people."
"RORY: We took ninety pictures."
"PARIS: What's your point?"
"RORY: My point is in ninety tries, there wasn't one other picture that was good for the group and didn't have me looking like I'm in Cirque du Soleil."
"PARIS: Sorry. Life can play some cruel tricks sometimes."
"RORY: Life had a little help from the Gellar camp this time. [cell phone rings] We are not done. [answers phone] Hello?"
"MAUREEN: Rory, hi, listen. I just got the call and  hold on a sec. I'll call him back. I'm back, sorry. Where was I?"
"RORY: Who is this?"
"MAUREEN: Maureen Rollins, Sherry's friend."
"RORY: Oh, yes, uh, right, Maureen, I'm sorry, I -"
"MAUREEN: Don't worry about it. Listen, I know the invitation said that we were all gathering at the c-section next week, but Sherry just went into labor."
"RORY: What?"
"MAUREEN: She screwed up, she's in labor, and she wanted me to call all the girls and beg them to get down to the hospital ASAP."
"RORY: Oh."
"MAUREEN: It's a big screw-up."
"RORY: I guess."
"MAUREEN: Can you come?"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"MAUREEN: You're a child, right?"
"RORY: What?"
"MAUREEN: School?"
"RORY: Huh?"
"MAUREEN: School, you have school?"
"RORY: Uh, yes, I have school, but "
"MAUREEN: Is there anyway you could reschedule school just for today? She completely screwed up, but she's still our Sherry."
"RORY: Well, I'm actually done with school now. I could grab a train and "
"MAUREEN: That would be the best, the absolute best. You are a great kid. She's at Boston Memorial. I will meet you there. Listen, I have Graydon Carter on the other line."
"RORY: Who?"
"MAUREEN: Graydon Carter. I have to go."
"RORY: Okay, bye."
"FLASHBACK  ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[A photographer is setting up in the living room]"
"EMILY: Please make sure the light is very soft. I want a luminous quality."
"PHOTOGRAPHER: I'm gonna have to see the young lady before I can set the final lighting."
"EMILY: Yes, of course. Arletta, did you call Lorelai?"
"ARLETTA: Yes, ma'am. Twenty minutes ago."
"EMILY: And what did she say?"
"ARLETTA: She said she was still getting dressed. Do you want me to go up there again?"
"EMILY: No, I'll do it. I swear, you'd think that it was my coming out portrait, not hers, for the amount of concern she has about all of this. I'll be right back. Don't scratch the floor."
"[Cut to upstairs  Young Lorelai is in her bedroom trying to fit into her debutante gown. There's a knock at the door.]"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, the photographer needs you downstairs."
"LORELAI: I'll be there in a sec."
"EMILY: He needs you now, not in a sec."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: I don't hear you walking toward the door."
"LORELAI: Mom, please."
"EMILY: I'm coming in."
"LORELAI: No."
"[Emily walks into the bedroom]"
"EMILY: I don't have time for your attitude young lady. This man is being paid by the hour. Why aren't you dressed?"
"LORELAI: I just. . .I think the zipper's too new or stiff or something."
"EMILY: Turn around, I'll do it. [tries to zip up the dress] Oh my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: It's not the zipper, it's the dress. It's too small."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"EMILY: Of course I'm sure. It's too small. How can it be too small? We had a fitting three months ago. Have you gained weight?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Hold your breath."
"LORELAI: I am."
"EMILY: Hold your breath!"
"LORELAI: I am!"
"EMILY: The only thing I can think of is the dressmaker must've written the measurements down wrong. Well, what are we supposed to do now? I certainly can't take a picture of you like that."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"EMILY: I'll just have to have him come back next week. And I'm going to call that woman at the dress shop and give her a piece of my mind. My God, is everyone in the world completely incompetent? Put on your sweats and run around the block. You're gonna fit into the next dress no matter what."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER (PRESENT)"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I have five minutes to drink as much coffee as I can before I have to drive to Hartford to spend the evening with my mother alone and. . .who am I saying this to?"
"KIRK: I was listening."
"LORELAI: Where's Luke?"
"KIRK: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Well, is he here? Is he coming back? How fresh is that pot?"
"KIRK: I don't know, I don't know, it was sitting there when I got here but that's only been a minute so I don't know."
"[Luke walks down from upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Oh, thank God. Hey, I desperately need a massive cup of coffee to go and  what happened to your face?"
"LUKE: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: It's visible."
"LUKE: Oh, I shaved."
"LORELAI: You going to the bank?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Funeral?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Drag club?"
"LUKE: Let's get you your coffee, shall we?"
"LORELAI: Hey, isn't that the sweater that "
"LUKE: Yes, it is."
"LORELAI: You look nice."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: What's the occasion?"
"LUKE: Oh, well "
"[Nicole walks into the diner]"
"NICOLE: Hi."
"LUKE: Hi."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's a girl. It's a. . ."
"LUKE: Nicole, this is Lorelai."
"NICOLE: Nice to meet you. I'm Nicole Leahy."
"LORELAI: Lorelai Gilmore."
"NICOLE: Wow, you look nice."
"LUKE: Yeah, you, too."
"NICOLE: So, you ready or should I sit down?"
"LUKE: No, let's go, I'm ready."
"NICOLE: Okay. [her cell phone rings] Oh, I'm sorry. I'll just "
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, hey Luke. . ."
"LUKE: She's a lawyer."
"LORELAI: So what? Luke!"
"LUKE: Shh!"
"NICOLE: Hello? Yes. No, I'm sorry, Monday's not gonna work, it'll have to be Tuesday. Yes, well, your client breaking a contract is fairly annoying also, but we're all dealing with that. Terrific to hear. Bye Michael. [hangs up] Sorry. The phone is going off now."
"LUKE: It's okay. Make as many calls as you want."
"NICOLE: Nice meeting you."
"LORELAI: You, too."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL"
"[Rory steps off the elevator and walks up to a woman]"
"MAUREEN: [on phone] As soon as I can. All right, bye."
"RORY: Maureen?"
"MAUREEN: Yes?"
"RORY: I'm Rory. I'm Christopher's daughter. You called me to come down."
"MAUREEN: Rory, yes, sweetie, thank God you're here. Sherry's gonna be so happy to see you. She's a basketcase. Well, who wouldn't be, right?"
"RORY: Where's everyone else?"
"MAUREEN: Oh, they're working."
"RORY: What?"
"MAUREEN: Well, we had all planned on next week, but Sherry screwed up, so what can you do? Thank God you're here. She'll be thrilled. She's feeling a little abandoned. Now, she's right in there. Do not mention how fat she is. For some reason, she's extremely sensitive about that today. Okay, kiss. I'll call you later to find out how everything's going."
"RORY: Wait, where are you going?"
"MAUREEN: I've gotta get back to work. I'm swamped today."
"RORY: You're leaving me here alone?"
"MAUREEN: Believe me, I would love to stay hon  impossible. What can I say? Sherry screwed up. Anyhow, you'll be fine. If you need anything, call."
"RORY: I don't have your number."
"MAUREEN: Sherry's got it. [walks away]"
"[Rory walks into Sherry's room]"
"RORY: Sherry? It's Rory."
"SHERRY: Rory? Oh my God, I'm so glad you're here."
"RORY: How are you?"
"SHERRY: This wasn't supposed to happen now."
"RORY: I know."
"SHERRY: Christopher's out of town. I think Maureen called him and left a message but it doesn't matter because he's not here. Where's Maureen?"
"RORY: Oh, well, she had to go back to work, but she said she'd call later."
"SHERRY: She's at work?"
"RORY: Yes."
"SHERRY: I'm lying in a bed. God knows what's gonna happen."
"RORY: Well, you're going to have a baby."
"SHERRY: And she goes back to work. I would love to go back to work, but I can't because I have to stay here."
"RORY: Well, yeah, because you're going to have a baby."
"SHERRY: She's not here. None of my friends are here. Christopher isn't here. No one is here. No one but you. Thank God you're here, Rory. I don't think that I could do this by myself because this wasn't supposed to happen until next week. I wrote it down. I wrote it down. I wrote it down!"
"RORY: Boy, do you look thin."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE (PRESENT)"
"[Emily opens the door for Lorelai]"
"EMILY: Well, it's a rare treat to have an evening alone with my daughter uncoerced."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is, isn't it?"
"EMILY: So Rory's at the hospital?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah. She's gonna see her new half-sister fresh from the oven."
"EMILY: Well, that's about an unpleasant a description as I've ever heard. I thought we'd have martinis."
"LORELAI: Very good thought."
"EMILY: Olives?"
"LORELAI: Twist."
"EMILY: So how's Rory feeling about Christopher's new baby?"
"LORELAI: She's very excited. It's kind of cute."
"EMILY: You should've gotten her a puppy."
"LORELAI: Stop. No maid tonight?"
"EMILY: Leloni usually takes Sundays off, but she wanted to switch and seeing as it's just you and I, I said yes."
"LORELAI: Leloni, huh? Very exotic name."
"EMILY: She's from Honolulu."
"LORELAI: Cool. Does she know Don Ho?"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: Charo?"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: The C&H Pure Cane Sugar dancers?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, please, we don't have a buffer here tonight."
"LORELAI: So who cooked dinner? Ugh, please don't tell me it's you cause we can always. . .diet."
"EMILY: Leloni made a roast before she left and I heated it up."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"EMILY: I even added a little wine to the pan to keep it from drying out."
"LORELAI: Well, who died and made you Sara Moulton?"
"EMILY: Drink this and be quiet."
"LORELAI: So, um, how long is Dad gone for this time?"
"EMILY: Two weeks."
"LORELAI: Didn't he just come home last week?"
"EMILY: Yes, he did."
"LORELAI: So business must be pretty good?"
"EMILY: I suppose. He has to work twice as hard as he ever did, and I'm still not sure that he's actually made a dime yet. However, he does see to be having the time of his life, so what can you do?"
"LORELAI: Nothing, I guess. Hey Mom, can I ask you something?"
"EMILY: Of course you can."
"LORELAI: What do you do while Dad is gone?"
"EMILY: Well, I do all sorts of things."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"EMILY: Well, I keep this house running."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"EMILY: And I have my DAR meetings and there's always a thousand calls to make. I have functions and fundraising events to organize. A million different things."
"LORELAI: Okay, but what do you do at night?"
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: I mean, you don't organize functions at night, do you?"
"EMILY: What are you insinuating?"
"LORELAI: I'm not insinuating anything, Mom. I'm just trying to find out a little bit about your life."
"EMILY: Well, your father calls every night at nine o'clock and we talk."
"LORELAI: So, you spend fifteen minutes talking to Dad and then you hang up the phone and you  what? Watch television?"
"EMILY: I don't watch that much television. I don't find forensic work quite as fascinating as the rest of the world."
"LORELAI: But you have cable, right? I mean, you could watch movies."
"EMILY: Yes, but I never know where the maid puts that guide they send you, so I always wind up turning it on after a movie has already started and I don't like to come in on the middle of things."
"LORELAI: But you could tape the movies, or get a DVD player."
"EMILY: I don't need a DVD player."
"LORELAI: Well, why not? Then you could buy all those musicals you love and watch them whenever you felt like it."
"EMILY: I'm not an invalid, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, of course you are, Mother. Why else would I suggest a DVD player?"
"EMILY: I can fill my time all by myself and I'd like you to drop this conversation right now."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"EMILY: We're going to eat. [starts walking toward the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: [follows her] Just because you leave the room doesn't mean the conversation's over. I started the conversation. The conversation's in me. Therefore, when I get over there, the conversation's just gonna start up again."
"FLASHBACK  ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily, Richard, and Christopher's parents are talking in the living room]"
"STRAUB: This is unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable."
"FRANCINE: I feel sick."
"STRAUB: Everything's gone. It's been tossed right out the window. Stop crying."
"EMILY: Here Francine, drink your water. We all need to calm down. Getting upset isn't going to get us anywhere."
"FRANCINE: What do we tell people?"
"EMILY: Well, who needs to know?"
"STRAUB: What do you mean, who needs to know?"
"EMILY: You don't have to yell at me, Straub."
"STRAUB: Everybody has to know, Emily. Everybody will know. We can't pretend this didn't happen."
"FRANCINE: You could send her away."
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"FRANCINE: Aren't there places that take girls like that?"
"EMILY: Girls like what, Francine?"
"FRANCINE: Well, girls in. . .I can't handle this, I can't handle this at all."
"STRAUB: Stop crying, dammit."
"EMILY: Christopher is just as much to blame as Lorelai is."
"STRAUB: Like hell he is."
"EMILY: They are in this together."
"STRAUB: I don't see why. Why should Christopher sacrifice everything we've planned for him just because "
"EMILY: Choose your words extremely carefully, Straub."
"FRANCINE: Emily, you know we love Lorelai, you know that. But Christopher's so young, he's a baby."
"EMILY: Well, Lorelai's not exactly collecting social security."
"STRAUB: Why doesn't she get rid of it?"
"EMILY: What?"
"FRANCINE: Straub."
"STRAUB: It's an option."
"EMILY: It certainly is not an option."
"STRAUB: Why not?"
"EMILY: Because I say so."
"STRAUB: Then what the hell are you suggesting, Emily? What's your great solution to this problem?"
"RICHARD: They will get married, they will live here, and Christopher will go to work at my company. That is the solution. Now, we have a plan so we can all stop talking about it. Please excuse me, I have work to do."
"EMILY: I think Richard's plan sounds very sensible."
"STRAUB: I just have one question  why his company?"
"EMILY: What do you mean, his company?"
"STRAUB: Well, I have a law firm. Christopher could go to school."
"[pan to Young Lorelai and Christopher sitting on the staircase]"
"LORELAI: I know we're all upset here folks, but maybe we should ask the kids what they think. Lorelai, Christopher, anything to add here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Quiet, they'll hear you."
"LORELAI: Not likely. I don't know how much longer I can just sit here like this."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay, let them talk."
"LORELAI: They're talking about us."
"CHRISTOPHER: They're trying to figure out what to do."
"LORELAI: What to do with our lives  our lives! Yours and mine and. . .its."
"CHRISTOPHER: We're gonna need their help."
"LORELAI: We can take care of ourselves."
"CHRISTOPHER: How?"
"LORELAI: We'll figure it out."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay. It sounds okay."
"LORELAI: What sounds okay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You know, working for your dad, living here. It sounds okay."
"LORELAI: Chris, no! What about Europe? What about sleeping on a bench in Paris?"
"CHRISTOPHER: We can't do that now. I have to get a job."
"LORELAI: No!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I have to make money."
"LORELAI: No!"
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay, really."
"EMILY: [in background] You're not even listening to each other."

"SHERRY: Great, who's next?"
"RORY: Um, Sheldon Harnick."
"SHERRY: Try and set him for Wednesday."
"RORY: Okay."
"SHERRY: Oh, and don't tell him I'm pregnant. He hates pregnancy."
"RORY: Oh, how about a plumbing problem?"
"SHERRY: Sounds good."
"[A nurse walks into the room]"
"NURSE: Okay, so how are we doing?"
"SHERRY: I'm not sure."
"NURSE: Well, don't be nervous. Everything's going to be just fine. I just wanted to check on you and to see who's going to be with you in the delivery room while it's happening."
"SHERRY: Oh, my fiancé's on his way. He's on his way, right?"
"RORY: Yes, he's on his way."
"SHERRY: Okay, so when he gets here, he'll come in with me."
"NURSE: And if he doesn't get here in time?"
"SHERRY: Then we'll just have to wait."
"NURSE: I'm afraid that's gonna be a little tough to arrange. Once it starts, that's it."
"SHERRY: Okay, well, then I guess it's Rory. Right?"
"RORY: Oh. Absolutely."
"NURSE: Okay, then I'm gonna get you a gown and some gloves so you'll be all set in case you have to go in."
"RORY: That sounds great."
"NURSE: I'll be right back. [leaves]"
"SHERRY: Okay, where were we?"
"RORY: Um, listen, Sherry, I really need a cup of coffee. Would you mind if I ran out really quick?"
"SHERRY: Oh, no, go ahead. I'll make the next few calls myself."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Rory walks into the hallway and calls Lorelai on her cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: Mom, they're giving me gloves!"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: I don't want gloves, I don't want a gown, I don't wanna be in there."
"LORELAI: In where?"
"RORY: In the delivery room with Sherry."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Dad's not here yet and she's freaking out and she told the nurse I'm going in and "
"LORELAI: Where are her other friends?"
"RORY: They had to work. I'm here all by myself and I'm trying very hard to be calm but I'm starting to feel nauseous, and the hospital has a smell, and there are noises, and those gowns do not stay closed and I've seen a lot of butts today! And -"
"LORELAI: Okay, sweetie, calm down."
"RORY: I need you."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I need you, I need you here, I need you now. I cannot do this alone. I need my Mommy, and dammit, I don't care who knows it!"
"LORELAI: What hospital is it?"
"RORY: Boston Memorial."
"LORELAI: I'll be right there."
"RORY: I really, really like you."
"LORELAI: Tell Sherry to keep her legs crossed til I get there."
"RORY: Does that work?"
"LORELAI: No. Bye. [hangs up] Mom, I gotta go, I'm sorry. Dinner was great."
"EMILY: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: Sherry's freaking out and Rory's the only one with her, so I'm going to the hospital."
"EMILY: You're going to be with Rory's father's girlfriend while she has his baby?"
"LORELAI: Gee, Mom, I can't at all tell what your opinion on that might be."
"EMILY: Why would you do this? This woman pulled Christopher away from you, away from Rory. She destroyed any chance you might have had "
"LORELAI: Rory asked me to come, that's why I'm going."
"EMILY: I don't understand what Rory's doing there either."
"LORELAI: She's going to have a sister."
"EMILY: Half-sister."
"LORELAI: Thank you for a lovely dinner. I'll see you next week."

"NURSE: Right through there."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Rory walks down the hall]"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"LORELAI: You're welcome, and I will be holding this over you for the next ten years. What are you doing?"
"RORY: Xeroxing."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Sherry had some status reports she promised to fax to people by tomorrow but she didn't bring enough, and so I've been trying to find a Xerox machine. I finally conned someone in ICU into letting me use theirs. I haven't found a fax machine yet, but "
"LORELAI: Okay, come on."
"RORY: I have to fax these."
"LORELAI: Uh huh, let's go."
"RORY: But we have a deadline."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"[they walk into Sherry's room]"
"SHERRY: [on phone] Yes, I'm having them faxed over right now. Yes, that's right. Well, I'm not sure if the numbers I have are the numbers that you have. That's right, that's bad. Uh huh. Well, I think you should, too. [to Rory] Did you get those things faxed?"
"LORELAI: Sherry, hang up."
"SHERRY: No, I have to finish this call."
"LORELAI: Just say goodbye."
"SHERRY: But "
"LORELAI: You'll call them back."
"SHERRY: I "
"[Lorelai takes the phone from her]"
"LORELAI: Hi. Uh, Sherry's gonna have to call you back. Yeah, I promise. Okay, goodbye. [hangs up]"
"SHERRY: No, that was work."
"LORELAI: Sherry, you really shouldn't be working right now."
"SHERRY: I can't just stop everything because I'm. . ."
"LORELAI: Having a baby. Admitting it is the first step, honey."
"SHERRY: I'm not ready. I had it planned. Christopher was supposed to be here."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SHERRY: I don't know what to do."
"LORELAI: Well, the first thing you have to do is calm down and stop working."
"SHERRY: Okay."
"LORELAI: And the second thing is, you need to tell me why you're sitting like that."
"SHERRY: Maureen told me that Howard Stern said that if you squat, it makes the baby come out faster."
"LORELAI: Okay, as long as you have a sane reason from a reliable source."
"SHERRY: I'm scared."
"LORELAI: I know. It's scary, and it hurts like hell. And remember, when it comes out not to look at it too hard until they give it a good cleaning, or you'll think you gave birth to phlegm. But, um, once they give it a good scrub, it's just unbelievably cool."
"SHERRY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Well, and look how good they grow up. Not bad, huh?"
"SHERRY: I hope I get that lucky."
"LORELAI: I've got a good feeling."
"SHERRY: Thank you. Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"SHERRY: My ankles are starting to hurt."
"LORELAI: Okay, grab an arm."
"SHERRY: I'm glad you're here."
"LORELAI: Well, at this moment, you probably should be."

"LORELAI: She's jogging in place."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: I think she's hoping to aerobicize the thing right out of there."
"RORY: Well, should we stop her?"
"LORELAI: I tried. She almost took an eye out."
"RORY: Well, that can't be good for the baby."
"LORELAI: Well, it's probably no worse than the guilt trip it's gonna get for showing up a week early."
"RORY: You do know it's a girl."
"LORELAI: Yes, I should probably stop calling it ""it"". Her ""it""."
"RORY: I was just bringing you some coffee."
"LORELAI: Thanks. Did you try calling your dad again?"
"RORY: His cell's not in service or out of range or something."
"LORELAI: You do know if he doesn't get here, I have to go in with her."
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't want to go in with her."
"RORY: At least you know what's gonna happen."
"LORELAI: I had the cheap seat before. My view was quite a bit different."
"RORY: Hey, should we buy a camera or something?"
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RORY: If Dad doesn't get here, shouldn't we maybe "
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: But "
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: I just thought it would be nice."
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor, Rory!"
"LORELAI: Oh, thank God you're here, Chris."
"CHRISTOPHER: Has it happened? Did I miss it?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: You have perfect timing."
"CHRISTOPHER: I must've broken fifteen different laws getting here. I don't even remember where I left my car. I thought I wasn't gonna make it."
"LORELAI: Well, take a breath, you did make it, and Sherry's gonna be thrilled."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where is she?"
"LORELAI: Come on."
"CHRISTOPHER: Is this. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"[they walk into Sherry's room, where she's being transferred to a gurney]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sherry!"
"SHERRY: Christopher, you're here! I can't believe you're here. I didn't think you'd make it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Are you kidding? You think I'd miss this."
"SHERRY: No, I'm sorry. It's just, I'm just in a lot of pain and I can't think straight."
"NURSE: I take it this is your fiancé."
"SHERRY: Yeah, this is him. This is my Christopher."
"NURSE: Well, Christopher, are you coming in with us?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Try and stop me."
"NURSE: Okay, let's go then."
"[they start wheeling her out of the room]"
"RORY: We'll be right here, waiting."
"LORELAI: Have fun."
"RORY: Have fun?"
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"FLASHBACK  HOSPITAL"
"[A nurse is wheeling Young Lorelai down the hall on a gurney]"
"LORELAI: Okay, this is a big pain and I'd really like it to go away, please."
"NURSE: Just breathe deep, honey."
"LORELAI: Breathing doesn't help, can I hit you instead?"
"NURSE: What?"
"LORELAI: Or pinch you really hard, cause that might make me feel better."
"NURSE: No, you cannot hit me."
"LORELAI: Can I bite you or pull your hair or use the Epilady on you cause I really need to do something."
"EMILY: Lorelai Gilmore!"
"LORELAI: Wheel this a little faster, please."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you do not do this. You do not just leave a person a note."
"LORELAI: Okay, see the timing here?"
"EMILY: ""Dear Mom and Dad, I'm in labor. See you later, Lorelai."""
"LORELAI: Ow."
"RICHARD: Emily, please, I feel ridiculous."
"EMILY: You're having a baby  do you know that, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Well, that explains the stomachache."
"EMILY: You do not leave your house when you are having a baby without telling your mother. You say, ""Excuse me, Mom. I'm having a baby, give me a ride to the damn hospital!"""
"RICHARD: Emily, please, I wore the wrong shoes for this."
"EMILY: Of all the things in the world I had a right to do, driving my daughter to the hospital to give birth, especially since she's sixteen years old and doesn't have her driver's license yet, is definitely one of them."
"NURSE: Ma'am, I need to wait out here, please."
"EMILY: Why?"
"NURSE: Because we're going into the delivery room."
"EMILY: I want to go in."
"LORELAI: No, Mom, please."
"RICHARD: Yes, Emily, please."
"EMILY: Fine, we'll be right here when you're done."
"LORELAI: Super."
"EMILY: And do not think we're finished discussing this, young lady, because we are not!"
"RICHARD: Emily, let's just sit here."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL (PRESENT)"
"RORY: I'm glad he got here."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Me, too."
"RORY: So I guess now we wait?"
"LORELAI: Yup, now we wait."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"JESS: Kirk, how long are you gonna sit here?"
"KIRK: What do you mean?"
"JESS: It's been four hours. Go home."
"KIRK: It's boring at home. My TV's broken."
"JESS: So do something else."
"KIRK: Like what?"
"JESS: Read a book."
"KIRK: What book?"
"JESS: Any book."
"KIRK: I'm gonna need a suggestion."
"JESS: Moby Dick."
"KIRK: That's about the whale?"
"JESS: Yes."
"KIRK: No. What else?"
"JESS: Forget it, just sit there."
"KIRK: Okay."
"[Luke and Nicole walk in]"
"LUKE: So he just drove all the way to New York, picked up the cheese, drove back. Nobody talked about it ever again."
"NICOLE: Oh, God, I love cheese."
"LUKE: Well, you would've gotten along very well with my father. So, you want some coffee?"
"NICOLE: I would love some coffee."
"LUKE: Have a seat. Jess, coffee over here."
"NICOLE: So, I have to say, I really hated that restaurant."
"LUKE: Good, I like that we're on the same page here."
"NICOLE: I did, however, have a really good time."
"LUKE: Once again, I like that we're on the same page here."
"JESS: Okay, coffee."
"NICOLE: Thank you."
"JESS: Did you have a good time?"
"NICOLE: Yeah, we had a really good time."
"JESS: Okay, well, I'm going to go out for about an hour."
"LUKE: What are you talking about? It's 11:30."
"JESS: I know. I'm just gonna go out for about an hour."
"LUKE: Where?"
"JESS: Out."
"LUKE: Out where?"
"JESS: Out for about an hour."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"JESS: I'm talking about going out for about an hour. What  you need more time?"
"LUKE: Nicole, will you excuse me for a minute?"
"NICOLE: Sure."
"LUKE: Okay."
"[Luke and Jess walk outside; they argue in front of the window]"
"KIRK: They have amazing communication."
"[Luke and Jess walk back inside]"
"JESS: I guess I'm not going out for about an hour."
"LUKE: Say goodnight, Jess."
"JESS: I don't understand you, man."
"LUKE: My mystique is part of my charm."
"JESS: You at least want me to take a walk around the block?"
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: Take an extra long shower?"
"LUKE: Go upstairs."
"JESS: Sorry, I tried."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL"
"[Lorelai is reading in the waiting room, Rory is asleep next to her. Christopher walks over to them]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor?"
"LORELAI: Are you a daddy?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Come on, come look. We'll wake Rory later."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[they walk down the hall]"
"LORELAI: So how was it?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, man, Lor, in my wildest dreams, I never could've imagined. I've never been that nervous or terrified or nauseous in my entire life. It was like the most amazing thing ever in the world. It was like. . .well, you know."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do know."
"CHRISTOPHER: I've never seen anything like it."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"CHRISTOPHER: And Sherry was great. I'm flying, I mean it, I'm flying."
"[they stand in front of the nursery window]"
"CHRISTOPHER: There."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"CHRISTOPHER: That's my daughter."
"LORELAI: I can tell."
"CHRISTOPHER: How?"
"LORELAI: I think she conned that one out of his blanket."
"CHRISTOPHER: She's perfect."
"LORELAI: Rory was perfect. She, however, is a good solid second."
"CHRISTOPHER: I just can't believe it."
"LORELAI: She's beautiful, really. Congratulations Christopher."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. Thank you for everything."
"LORELAI: Of course."
"FLASHBACK  HOSPITAL"
"[Young Lorelai and Christopher are looking through the nursery window at baby Rory]"
"CHRISTOPHER: She's pretty."
"LORELAI: She's perfect."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, I guess we should get married."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL  (PRESENT)"
"[Lorelai and Christopher are still looking at the baby through the window]"
"CHRISTOPHER: I should wake Rory, don't you think?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she'd like to see this."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE (PRESENT)"
"[Emily is going through the mail when the doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: I'll get it, Leloni. You find out where that smell is coming from. [answers door] Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom."
"EMILY: What on Earth are you doing here? What is this?"
"LORELAI: This is your new DVD player."
"EMILY: My what?"
"LORELAI: Plus, I picked up Singin' in the Rain, Funny Girl, Easter Parade, An American in Paris, and as an added bonus, the new classic dance series  Urban Cowboy, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Footloose, and Flashdance. Trust me, you're gonna be cutting up your sweatshirts all weekend."
"EMILY: Why did you do this?"
"LORELAI: Cause I thought you'd enjoy it."
"EMILY: But I don't know anything about a DVD player."
"LORELAI: Mom, trust me, once it's hooked up, all you'll have to know is how to press play."
"EMILY: But who's gonna hook it up?"
"LORELAI: I am."
"EMILY: You know how to hook this up?"
"LORELAI: I know how to read an instruction manual."
"EMILY: Since when?"
"LORELAI: Hm, please."
"EMILY: Maybe we should get a professional."
"LORELAI: I can do this. Just give me five seconds here."
"EMILY: Well? Well, can you do it? Oh, just forget it."
"LORELAI: Mom, please, just let me focus on this for one more second, and if I cannot do it, I'll get a professional DVD guy in here to install it, okay?"
"EMILY: I still don't understand why you got me this. [looks at the DVDs] I love this movie."
"FLASHBACK  ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily and Richard walk down the stairs]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, we're leaving! Well, what do you know? She finally put Rory's stroller away. It's the first time in a year I haven't tripped over that thing."
"RICHARD: Where's my scarf?"
"EMILY: I told Tina to put everything out for you, Richard."
"RICHARD: Out where?"
"EMILY: Look on the table."
"RICHARD: You have to be more specific with her, Emily."
"EMILY: Fine, Richard."
"RICHARD: There should be a designated place to put things."
"EMILY: Whatever you say, Richard. Lorelai, we are leaving! Please acknowledge that! Where is that girl?"
"RICHARD: This is not the scarf I asked for."
"EMILY: Well, it looks fine. Can you just wear it?"
"RICHARD: No, I'm gonna go back upstairs and get the scarf I intended to wear in the first place. Well, I'm surprised at you Emily. These are your friends we're seeing tonight. You would have thought that my appearance would be a priority for you. I didn't want to go to this thing in the first place. I have an early meeting in the morning, and I would much rather go to bed and ignore the fact that the symphony has to reupholster its mezzanine this year."
"[Emily reads a note on the table and starts to cry]"
"RICHARD: Emily? Emily?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE (PRESENT)"
"[Emily waits while Lorelai reads through the DVD player's instruction manual]"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: Well, can you do it?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea."
"EMILY: Where are you going? Are you going to take it back?"
"LORELAI: I'm going upstairs."
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: I think I should put this in your bedroom. That's your best TV."
"EMILY: You just said you didn't know how to hook that up."
"LORELAI: I'll figure it out."
"EMILY: But there are wires involved and connections and electricity. You could hurt yourself or set the house on fire."
"LORELAI: [sings] In your Easter bonnet. . ."
"EMILY: You could ruin our television set."
"LORELAI: . . .with all the frills upon it, you'll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade. Hoo! I'll be all in clover. . ."
"EMILY: I don't like being ignored, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: . . .and when they look us over, we'll be the proudest people in the Easter parade."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are eating dinner]"
"EMILY: And then she just brushed me off with a wave of her regal hand. Not even a word, just a. . .like I'm her cabana boy. Next thing you know, instead of just walking out of the room, she'll make me bow and back out. Imperious attitude, she never gives it a rest. I schlepped her to the doctor the other day  by command, not request  and the elevator operator there greeted us nice and friendly. Her doctor's on the second floor and by the time we got there, that operator was in tears."
"LORELAI: Whew."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, Mom, you just did twenty straight minutes on Gran."
"EMILY: It wasn't twenty minutes."
"RORY: It was getting there."
"LORELAI: How about a moratorium on the Gran stories for a bit?"
"EMILY: Fine. I'd rather not spoil the meal with talk of her."
"LORELAI: Good."
"EMILY: I should just wash my hands."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: We'll wait."
"EMILY: I mean of her."
"LORELAI: Oh, good, wash those hands."
"EMILY: She sucks her olive pits."
"LORELAI: Short moratorium."
"EMILY: Trying to extract every last ounce of flavor out of them like she does people."
"LORELAI: She sucks flavor out of people?"
"RORY: Can we change the subject?"
"EMILY: Life, not flavor."
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what Gran needs?"
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: A fella."
"RORY: With or without an umbrella."
"EMILY: He'd have to look like an olive pit to get her attention."
"LORELAI: It's like a Dean Martin Roast."
"RORY: Those are never funny to me."
"LORELAI: Yeah, they're mean."
"RORY: Except for Don Rickles."
"LORELAI: Totally except for Rickles."
"EMILY: I think she did have a man for a time squiring her around to her biddy affairs. Richard thought so, too, and it horrified him."
"LORELAI: Didn't want a new Daddy, huh?"
"EMILY: And then he seemed suddenly out of the picture."
"RORY: So Great Grandma never talked about him?"
"EMILY: Never. Even though I could tell practically the day she stopped seeing him. Those kinds of things are always obvious."
"RORY: Yeah, I guess."
"EMILY: When a couple is in a relationship and then suddenly isn't."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: Is she still looking?"
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: Right. Um, you know, Grandma, did I mention that unfortunately I'm not with Dean anymore?"
"EMILY: No, you didn't."
"RORY: Well, I'm not."
"EMILY: Well, yes, I've known for weeks actually. But it's good that you confirmed it."
"RORY: How did you know?"
"EMILY: Well, you very abruptly stopped mentioning him eleven dinners ago, so I figured that was the case."
"LORELAI: Eleven dinners, you kept count?"
"EMILY: Eleven."
"LORELAI: Eleven."
"RORY: Well, I'm sorry I didn't tell you Grandma."
"EMILY: Well, I think you should have. I mean, what if I had invited Dean to an event and you were no longer with him, and that's how I found out? It would've been embarrassing."
"LORELAI: What sort of event would you have invited Dean to?"
"EMILY: I don't know, a wedding."
"LORELAI: For who?"
"EMILY: A mutual friend or something."
"LORELAI: You and Dean have mutual friends in common that Rory and I don't? Who would that be, the Talbotts or that senior partner at Deloite and Touche?"
"EMILY: You know what I meant. It's always best to tell each other major life events so that there's no awkwardness."
"RORY: Well, then, Grandma, I probably also failed to mention that I'm seeing someone else."
"EMILY: Who?"
"RORY: Jess."
"EMILY: Jess?"
"LORELAI: Luke's nephew. Luke from the diner."
"EMILY: Oh, I see. Well, am I going to get to meet him soon?"
"RORY: Oh, I don't know."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange."
"EMILY: Well, how hard can it be? Just bring him over for dinner sometime. How about next Friday?"
"RORY: Oh, I don't know."
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange."
"EMILY: It's perfect timing. Richard will still be out of town and it would be nice to round off the group with a fourth."
"LORELAI: He works Fridays, doesn't he?"
"RORY: Yeah, that's his usual night. Friday night. It's a bad night."
"EMILY: Oh, okay. Well, I suppose I'll eventually meet him someday at some function."
"LORELAI: Perhaps a wedding."
"EMILY: Or Rory's graduation. That's good. That way we'll all get to meet him at once. Myself, Richard, Gran. Maybe I'll bring a couple of girls from the DAR. Reverend Mahoney might like to come also."
"RORY: You know what, Grandma, now that I think about it, I think Jess does have next Friday night off."
"EMILY: Really?"
"RORY: Let's make it a foursome."
"EMILY: That'll be nice."
"RORY: Yeah, it will be nice, right Grandma?"
"EMILY: Very nice. We'll have lamb."
"RORY: So, it will be nice for everybody? Everybody will be nice to everybody? The key word being nice."
"EMILY: Yes, very nice."
"RORY: Really, really nice?"
"EMILY: Of course it'll be nice. That's what I just said."
"RORY: Good. Nice would be nice."
"EMILY: And a nice night it'll be."
"LORELAI: Well, not so nice for the lamb."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the kitchen table]"
"LORELAI: Okay, Saturday morning I've got hair appointment, nails, and Jim."
"RORY: You don't go to the gym."
"LORELAI: No, Jim is coming here to fix the garbage disposal."
"RORY: Jim Dunning, got it."
"LORELAI: I also have resha plebisham."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, I can't read it."
"RORY: Shouldn't you change your system, go electronic or something? You're a busy woman."
"LORELAI: Uh, hey, my system works."
"RORY: Yeah, tell that to the guy who calls tomorrow because you missed your resha plebisham appointment."
"LORELAI: I hate that we have to coordinate schedules. You're my daughter."
"RORY: But if we don't, we may never see each other."
"LORELAI: We didn't use to have to do this."
"RORY: Well, we're busier now."
"LORELAI: Let's just run away together and leave all this behind."
"RORY: You mean our house?"
"LORELAI: No, we'll take the house, we'll leave everything else."
"RORY: Put it on your list."
"LORELAI: So what's your day like tomorrow?"
"RORY: Hanging out with Jess for most of the day, studying at night."
"LORELAI: Cool. Alex and I are having dinner tomorrow night."
"RORY: Good. That'll make it nice and quiet for when I study."
"LORELAI: I'm that loud?"
"RORY: You are when you dance around singing Rory's Studying' songs."
"LORELAI: Oh, what's this I have down for Sunday  slatha bang trafficking?"
"RORY: Lane's band practicing."
"LORELAI: And underneath it  net fracks?"
"RORY: Get snacks."
"LORELAI: Right  for the band. See, see, it works. So, uh, you're actually bringing Jess to dinner on Friday?"
"RORY: It's as good a time as any. There'll only be one grandparent to contend with."
"LORELAI: Man, that was some stealthy little maneuver she pulled there, huh? Applying the guilt over not knowing about the Dean breakup and making you all weak, and then using that to get Jess to come to dinner on Friday. She's like Lyndon Johnson with the Senate, effortless."
"RORY: So, Sunday's for us, right?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have you down right here  Cokie."
"RORY: Good. Hey, it's still early. Do you wanna watch more of the extra supplementary stuff on the Lord of the Rings DVD?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's just the drawings and that fat guy talking."
"RORY: Well, let's watch Footloose again."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Hey, you dropped some of your notes."
"LORELAI: Oh, who cares? You can't read them anyway."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Rory and Jess are sitting on a bench looking at a book]"
"RORY: Do you love it?"
"JESS: It's great."
"RORY: The Holy Barbarians. I mean, what a title. And it's by a Venice Beach b*at about Venice Beach b*at, and to top it off, the b*at who wrote it is the father of the guy that does those Actor's Studio interviews on TV."
"JESS: The guy with the beard?"
"RORY: Yeah, the pointy beard. That's his dad writing at his desk."
"JESS: Oh, it's weird that a weird b*at guy would have a conservative son like that."
"RORY: Maybe he's not that conservative. Maybe at night, he, like, takes off his clothes and parties."
"JESS: Aw, man, now get that picture out of my head."
"RORY: It's a cool book, you've gotta admit."
"JESS: It is. Thanks."
"RORY: Oh, I'm not lending it. I'm not done."
"JESS: Well, why'd you show it to me?"
"RORY: I like showing you the stuff I'm reading."
"JESS: But you knew I'd wanna read it. You're a book tease."
"RORY: You'll get it when I'm done."
"JESS: Cruel woman."
"RORY: So, are you going to work now?"
"JESS: Back to the salt mines."
"RORY: So, you're not tied to the hours you have, right? You can trade if you want to."
"JESS: There's some flexibility."
"RORY: You got any flexibility next Friday night?"
"JESS: Yeah, why?"
"RORY: I thought maybe you could come to dinner with us."
"JESS: Us?"
"RORY: To my Grandma's."
"JESS: To meet your grandmother."
"RORY: Yeah, she'll be there, so yeah, it might be rude not to introduce the two of you."
"JESS: I can't, I gotta work."
"RORY: You just said you could get out."
"JESS: I didn't know what for."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: No."
"RORY: But I already kind of agreed."
"JESS: Aw, man."
"RORY: So I'm kinda jammed here."
"JESS: Does she know what I look like?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"JESS: Perfect. Find someone who vaguely resembles me. Take him. Just don't kiss him goodnight."
"RORY: That's not going to work."
"JESS: Andy Warhol did it all the time. [Rory gives him the book] We're just five bucks away from a deal."
"RORY: [kisses him] That's worth five at least."
"JESS: You Gilmores think a lot of yourselves. Okay."
"RORY: Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"JESS: Manipulator."
"[They both walk away in opposite directions. Rory walks past the dance studio as Miss Patty walks out]"
"MISS PATTY: Rory, get in here."
"RORY: What?"
"MISS PATTY: Get in here now. No questions."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they walk into the dance studio. Rory sits down next to Dean.]"
"MISS PATTY: Okay, now, for those who just arrived, I'm trying out some material for my one-woman show and I need some feedback. You are my randomly picked audience."
"DEAN: Randomly shang-hai'ed."
"MISS PATTY: It's part stories, part songs. Kind of like what Elaine Stritch did on Broadway, but without the bitterness. My working title  ""Buckle Up, I'm Patty."""
"RORY: How long have you been here?"
"DEAN: An hour."
"RORY: Poor thing."
"DEAN: It's been mostly her and Kirk arguing about stuff. Apparently, he's the director."
"KIRK: Patty, let's try one of your reminisces."
"MISS PATTY: That's what I'm looking for, Kirk."
"DEAN: Sorry I didn't save you. I didn't see you until it was too late."
"RORY: I don't think anybody could've saved me."
"MISS PATTY: Okay, here we go. Hey, did you know that I once met the great Bette Davis? I was a chorus girl in a bus-and-truck tour of ""Guys and Dolls."" Beantown, I love that town. And there I was, me and the girls backstage after the show, and in she comes. And who does she walk right up to, but little old me. And she sized me up, exhaled some smoke from that regal mouth of hers, and said, ""Doll, you don't got the high notes but you sure got the gams."" I'll always treasure that moment with Bette and I wanna dedicate this song to her. Uh, Ethel, key a D."
"KIRK: We're gonna have to rewrite that."
"MISS PATTY: What?"
"KIRK: It got no response. It needs a rewrite."
"MISS PATTY: Kirk, it's my reminiscence. I can't rewrite it."
"KIRK: How about if she says, ""Doll, you've got the gams, but I've got a body in the trunk of my car."""
"MISS PATTY: Why would she say that?"
"KIRK: Because she's a m*rder. I think it works."
"MISS PATTY: I'm not rewriting my memories, Kirk."
"KIRK: It died. Build a coffin for it, put some pennies on its eyes cause that stiff ain't breathing."
"MISS PATTY: Well, I think that we should discuss this later, now go back to your light booth."
"KIRK: Fine, start the song."
"MISS PATTY: [sings] It's a quarter of three, there is no one in the place, except you and me. [strobe light starts flashing] Kirk, would you fix this?"
"KIRK: Fix what?"
"MISS PATTY: This flashing."
"KIRK: That's my choice for the song."
"MISS PATTY: It's disco."
"KIRK: I'm trying to subvert expectations."
"MISS PATTY: Well, don't. Just give me a simple spot."
"KIRK: Something more obvious, got it."
"RORY: This is a hit."
"DEAN: It'll run for years."
"KIRK: Something on the nose and expected, got it."
"MISS PATTY: Kirk!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Later that night, Rory and Dean walk out of the dance studio]"
"RORY: It was nice of you to step in like that."
"DEAN: Well, she could've hurt herself trying to throw the podium at him like that."
"RORY: I think ""work in progress"" is the key phrase."
"DEAN: I like that she tries."
"RORY: The woman taught me everything I've already forgotten about dancing, baton twirling and gymnastics."
"DEAN: Well, I'm this way."
"RORY: I'm this way."
"DEAN: See you later."
"RORY: See ya."
"DEAN: You know, I kind of liked the body in the trunk thing."
"RORY: Me, too. Peppier."
"DEAN: Night."
"RORY: Night."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is studying on the couch when she hears a noise outside. She walks to the door and opens it. Lorelai and Alex are kissing on the front porch]"
"RORY: Oh, sorry."
"LORELAI: It's okay."
"ALEX: It's okay."
"RORY: I can just shut the door so you can carry on."
"ALEX: No, we've carried on enough."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I think we've carried on pretty good out here. I'll call you about the weekend."
"ALEX: Okay."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"ALEX: Bye. Bye Rory."
"RORY: Goodnight."
"[Alex leaves. Lorelai walks into the house]"
"RORY: We need a signal."
"LORELAI: A kissing signal?"
"RORY: Something to avoid this."
"LORELAI: Okay, um, how bout I sh**t off a flare when I'm outside necking with a boy?"
"RORY: You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: Or I could bang on the door and yell, ""Hey, we're necking out here!"""
"RORY: I still say we need a signal."
"LORELAI: We'll think of something. Hey, listen. Alex and I were talking about going to New York next weekend."
"RORY: Fun."
"LORELAI: Yeah. He's got four tickets to a show and he's heard me talk about Sookie and Jackson so much that he wants to invite them, too."
"RORY: It's not ""Buckle Up, I'm Patty,"" is it?"
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: We'd have to leave Friday day."
"RORY: So?"
"LORELAI: Meaning it's just you and Jess alone at dinner with the glorious Emily."
"RORY: Oh, that's totally fine."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"RORY: Yeah, it might even make things easier."
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: Nothing. Just, it might make it less pressure-packed."
"LORELAI: So I'm loud when you study and make social gatherings worse?"
"RORY: Out of the goodness of your heart, you would be trying to shield me all night, and that might makes things worse. Out of love. And I love you, I hope you know that."
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I think I get it. I have the best intentions."
"RORY: Bingo. [answers phone] Hello?"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey. How was work?"
"JESS: I toted the barge, lifted the bale."
"RORY: Well, you're a great barge toter, I can attest to that."
"JESS: How was your day?"
"RORY: Fine. A lot of studying."
"JESS: Oh yeah? Is that all you did?"
"RORY: Yeah, basically."
"JESS: Basically?"
"RORY: Jess, what?"
"JESS: I heard that you were basically hanging out with Dean today."
"RORY: Where did you hear that?"
"JESS: It's all over town."
"RORY: Well, I was with him for awhile. What do you mean, it's all over town?"
"JESS: You haven't seen the fliers?"
"RORY: I've been home all night. What fliers?"
"JESS: It says, ""People are already raving about Miss Patty's one woman show."""
"RORY: And?"
"JESS: There's some blurbs. One says, ""Rory and Dean couldn't stop talking about it."""
"RORY: We're on a flier?"
"JESS: You and a bunch of others. ""The mailman says, even without proper postage, this show delivers."""
"RORY: Well, now she's making that up cause Ralph's not that witty."
"JESS: Were you hanging out there with Dean?"
"RORY: I was not hanging out with Dean. We were both hauled in there to watch her try out material and we were sitting in the same area so we talked a little, and then we left at the same time. That was it. It was all by accident."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: This is an old subject, Jess. You know that Dean and I are friendly."
"JESS: I know you're friendly. That doesn't mean I don't wanna punch him."
"RORY: This was not a plan. I was kidnapped by Miss Patty, so was he, that's it."
"JESS: Then you two should press charges."
"RORY: I think we should."
"JESS: Just "
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: Just tell me these things first so I don't have to read about them on telephone poles."
"RORY: I will, I promise."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"JESS: So, how was the show?"
"RORY: It's gonna need a lot of postage."
"JESS: Why does it say, ""Not in any way affiliated with Kirk"" down at the bottom?"
"RORY: Oh, they had a showbiz spat."
"JESS: Fill me in."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai gets out snacks for the band, who are sitting at the table]"
"LORELAI: Help yourselves to drinks in the fridge, guys. We've got chips, pretzels, and Brian, I remembered your allergies and got you the melba toast."
"BRIAN: That's nice, thanks."
"DAVE: We got a lot done today."
"LANE: We've almost got a full set."
"ZACH: But you know what we're missing? A straight-ahead love song."
"BRIAN: Yeah, all our songs are pretty much about property destruction and a general dislike of right-wing causes."
"LORELAI: Not one love song, huh?"
"DAVE: I think we can add one or two, that are good ones."
"LORELAI: Boy, you'd think love songs are all you and Lane would wanna play."
"ZACH: Man, this crunch just now sounded like the drum-fill in Baba O'Reilly."
"LANE: Cool, way to go Zach."
"DAVE: Yeah, Zach, a musical mouth. That's awesome."
"ZACH: But why would Dave and Lane wanna play just love songs?"
"LORELAI: Because, I was just thinking, you know, with Dave's name  Dave  you've got the last two letters in love. V, E. And with Lane's name, you have the L. You can just dump the A and add an O and there you go."
"ZACH: Makes sense."
"BRIAN: Totally. We should probably start breaking stuff down. I gotta get home for dinner."
"ZACH: One day soon, you're not gonna go home from dinner."
"BRIAN: What, I'll be dead?"
"ZACH: No, we'll be on tour."
"BRIAN: Right, right."
"ZACH: That was a negative ""right, right,"" man."
"[Zach and Brian go outside]"
"LORELAI: Guys, I'm so sorry. It just slipped out."
"LANE: That's okay."
"DAVE: Luckily Zach and Brian are. . .well, Zach and Brian."
"LORELAI: How long are you gonna keep it a secret?"
"LANE: For awhile, at least. It's easier."
"LORELAI: Are you sure it would be so bad if they knew? I mean, keeping this a secret seems awfully complicated."
"LANE: Not really, we've got a system."
"DAVE: Um, speaking of which, it's 3:18. We'll have the stuff packed by 3:40, what's the situation?"
"LANE: At 3:40, my mom will be on her way to the yarn store for her bimonthly sew-a-thon with Lacey Schwartz and Bick Ho."
"DAVE: The yarn store's on Peach."
"LANE: Plum."
"DAVE: That cuts us off from our usually route to the interstate."
"LANE: There's a back road that circles around it, but it's gonna be muddy from the rains."
"DAVE: How about I have the guys take the usual route, I'll go by foot on Peach, down the alley behind Al's, over the fence, and they can pick me up a half a mile down by the Shell station."
"LANE: Perfect. Uh, what, that's not complicated."
"LORELAI: Sorry I doubted you."
"LANE: Well, okay, then."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey. Coffee?"
"LORELAI: Please, and hurry. I am going to Manhattan this weekend and I need to shop for some warm clothes."
"LUKE: You already have warm clothes."
"LORELAI: I have nothing."
"LUKE: We're in Connecticut. It gets freezing here same as in New York."
"LORELAI: No, it's not the same."
"LUKE: Exactly the same."
"LORELAI: Well, I have nothing stylish enough."
"LUKE: That's not true, you got the black cashmere coat."
"LORELAI: But it needs cleaning."
"LUKE: So clean it."
"LORELAI: But I need some sweaters, too."
"LUKE: You've got the purple, you've got the powder blue, you've got three shades of red, you've got a ton of black, all of which will go with that coat. Plus, you've got a dozen scarves to mix and match with any of those tops."
"LORELAI: Let me shop for some clothes."
"LUKE: Okay. So what are you doing in New York?"
"LORELAI: Oh, a bunch of us are going. It'll be dinner and a show."
"LUKE: Oh, what show?"
"LORELAI: Levittown, it's a new musical."
"LUKE: Right, yeah. It's in previews, doesn't officially open for a couple weeks."
"LORELAI: Wow, so informed."
"LUKE: Nicole likes the theater. Her firm has an office on Madison. I've met her there a couple times. Saw Hairspray last week."
"LORELAI: I cannot picture you watching Hairspray."
"LUKE: It was okay. I liked The Producers better."
"LORELAI: Well, aren't we just a Broadway baby."
"LUKE: Gonna have any time to k*ll there?"
"LORELAI: Some."
"LUKE: Got a great book, it has walking tours of old historic Manhattan. You know, before Disney got a hold of it. The Soho one's pretty good."
"LORELAI: Oh, I love stuff like that."
"LUKE: It's upstairs on my dresser if you wanna run up and grab it."
"LORELAI: Cool, thanks."
"[Cut to upstairs. Lorelai walks into Luke's apartment and finds Rory and Jess kissing on the couch]"
"LORELAI: Oh, oh!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Surprise."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: I came up for a book."
"JESS: A book?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"JESS: Got a lot of books here. Anything in particular?"
"LORELAI: It's one of Luke's."
"JESS: Well, if it doesn't have Encyclopedia Brown in the title, that narrows it down a lot."
"LORELAI: Walking tours, New York."
"JESS: On the table. [hands her the book]"
"LORELAI: Good, here it is, okay, so, thanks. Sorry about this."
"RORY: It's okay."
"LORELAI: We should probably come up with a system or something."
"RORY: Probably."
"LORELAI: Déjà vu, huh?"
"RORY: Déjà vu."
"LORELAI: Although, why I'd be walking into Luke's apartment like this in the future, I don't know, so put the system on the back burner."
"JESS: Okay."
"LORELAI: Mmkay. Carry on, or. . .see ya."
"[Lorelai walks back down to the diner]"
"LORELAI: Dude!"
"LUKE: Hey. Find it okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I found everything -- including a couple coupling."
"LUKE: Oh, Rory and Jess?"
"LORELAI: No, Ben and J. Lo. Yes, Rory and Jess."
"LUKE: I guess I should've told you."
"LORELAI: You knew they were up there?"
"LUKE: They're up there all the time."
"LORELAI: On the couch. . .horizontal, on the couch?"
"LUKE: They come up for air every so often."
"LORELAI: And you just allow this? Luke!"
"LUKE: Settle down. I go up there every ten minutes pretending to get something to keep them from doing something we don't want. ""Oops, I forgot my pocketknife."" ""Oops, uh, I'm out of ones."" ""Uh, hey, you see a case of mustard up here?"" I put the stuff in a box. I take the box upstairs every couple days and start all over again."
"LORELAI: And you think that suffices?"
"LUKE: Look, it's better that they're safe and upstairs than someplace else. And you going up there just now saved me a trip, so thanks."
"LORELAI: Glad to be of service."
"LUKE: I got a good system, it works."
"LORELAI: Every ten minutes?"
"LUKE: Like clockwork, never a minute more."
"LORELAI: Even if you're serving a customer, it's every ten minutes?"
"LUKE: If I'm in mid-pour, I stop and go up."
"LORELAI: Ten minutes. Yeah, that's pretty much the time it took to create Rory. And that included getting dressed and freshening my lipstick."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Thanks for the book."
"LUKE: Caesar, cover for me."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks toward the staircase]"
"LORELAI: [from upstairs] Rory?"
"RORY: I'm coming."
"LORELAI: Toute de suite, and I don't mean the candy."
"[Rory walks into Lorelai's bedroom]"
"RORY: Okay, what's the packing crisis?"
"LORELAI: That's the thing. I have no packing crisis. For the first time in my life, there is no packing crisis. See? This has never happened to me before. I'm all packed, ready to go, and fully confident that I have everything I'll need or desire."
"RORY: So you're creating a crisis out of nostalgia?"
"LORELAI: No, see, Alex and I talked about everything we plan to do and how he expected to dress and how I expected to dress, and we coordinated to the point where I knew each piece of clothing I had to bring, down to the Spice Girls necklace I plan to wear Saturday morning for breakfast because we agreed to keep it a little whimsical."
"RORY: So, not your Jonas Salk necklace?"
"LORELAI: I'm trying to become as good a planner as you."
"RORY: So, what's the problem?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea what to wear on the drive. I wanna look good, obviously, but not too good that it steps on my night outfit, and I also wanna be comfortable."
"RORY: What's he wearing, a jogging suit?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, and then after, he and Paulie are hitting the Bada Bing."
"RORY: Your point being, it's probably not a running suit."
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: And tonight's a dress?"
"LORELAI: And, uh, my cashmere coat and a hat."
"RORY: Your stretchy jeans and your Bunnyranch T-shirt."
"LORELAI: Comfort and raunch, I love it. Good. So, um, how are you guys working the logistics tonight?"
"RORY: I am going to study at school, then I'm going straight to Grandma's from there. Jess is driving straight from work, and then he's driving me home."
"LORELAI: Home? Home here?"
"RORY: Yeah, he's gonna drop me off here."
"LORELAI: Well, I guess that makes sense."
"RORY: I thought so."
"LORELAI: Although, hm, I don't know."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Are you sure that's the best way to do it?"
"RORY: Yeah, why?"
"LORELAI: Well, it just means you're coming home to an empty house."
"RORY: Well, that's your doing, not mine."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but it might be kind of lonely here. Did you think about staying at Mom's?"
"RORY: Overnight?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. They've got those fancy beds that don't sag, and you're guaranteed a great Norma Desmond style breakfast the next morning. You don't have school, it works out perfectly."
"RORY: I'd rather just come home."
"LORELAI: Okay, sure. But, you know, staying at your grandmother's would also mean that Jess wouldn't have to go out of his way at the end of the night to drop you off. It would be much more convenient for him."
"RORY: Our house is two-tenths of a mile out of his way."
"LORELAI: Are you sure he's gonna have enough gas?"
"RORY: I'll make sure."
"LORELAI: But if you can't get a hold of him, it might be safer to plan on staying at Mom's. I mean, if you run out of gas, you're stuck. And at the mercy of the Orcs."
"RORY: Mom, why are you so freaked?"
"LORELAI: This is not freaked."
"RORY: Is it because you won't be here and he will?"
"LORELAI: Uh, it might've crossed my mind."
"RORY: And what are you worried about happening?"
"LORELAI: Well, what you guys were on the on-ramp for up at Luke's the other day. Your basic boy/girl stuff. Especially with this new boy, you girl stuff."
"RORY: Well, the boy is different, but I'm still me. That hasn't changed."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know."
"RORY: And I have so much on my mind, so many things going on in my life, that I don't ever have time to think about that."
"LORELAI: No thinking at all?"
"RORY: None, I swear."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm, sure, sure."
"RORY: And we talk about everything together, you and me, remember? So it's not like something will happen that you won't know about."
"LORELAI: Good. [doorbell rings] That's Alex. Come on."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily and Rory are sitting in the living room]"
"EMILY: You know, you didn't have to change."
"RORY: Well, I feel kind of dumb being in my uniform when I'm not in school."
"EMILY: But you look darling in it. I'm going to miss it when you go to college."
"RORY: Yeah, I am, too, in a way. I mean, I like not having to think about what I'm going to wear."
"EMILY: And you'll have plenty of years to stress yourself out about that."
"RORY: I'm sorry he's late."
"EMILY: We're fine. Dinner will keep."
"RORY: I know how you like things to be punctual."
"EMILY: There was a big tie-up on the 84 earlier. He's probably smack dab in the middle of that. Why don't you try him on his cell phone, see what's going on."
"RORY: He doesn't have one."
"EMILY: Really?"
"RORY: He doesn't believe in them."
"EMILY: Well, I find that refreshing. Technology is encroaching too fast on every aspect of life, if you ask me. It's getting to the point where people will want robots to carry them from place to place. [the doorbell rings] There he is."
"[they walk to the door. Jess is standing on the porch with a black eye]"
"RORY: What "
"JESS: Sorry I'm late."
"EMILY: Oh, that's all right. Come in, come in. It's cold out."
"RORY: Um, Grandma, this is Jess. Jess, my grandmother."
"EMILY: Nice to meet you."
"JESS: Same here."
"RORY: Uh, what happened to your eye?"
"JESS: It's a long story, I don't wanna bore you."
"EMILY: Oh, this is new?"
"RORY: Brand new."
"EMILY: It looks bad. Does it hurt?"
"JESS: I'm fine."
"RORY: Is it why you were late?"
"JESS: No, 84 was jammed."
"EMILY: We knew that, too. There was something with a big rig. Oh, those things, they scare the life out of me. And apparently, all the men who drive them are hopped up on bennies and goofballs. Come, come, have a seat at the table. I'll go check on dinner. [walks away]"
"JESS: Shouldn't we go with her?"
"RORY: Were you in a fight?"
"JESS: Dinner's waiting."
"RORY: Jess, were you in a fight?"
"JESS: I told you, it's a long story, I don't wanna talk about it."
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Look, Rory, I'm already in a crappy mood. Traffic sucked. Traffic I hit going to a function I didn't particularly wanna go to. And I'm thirsty. And I'm hungry. So let's eat."
"[they walk to the dining room]"
"JESS: So do we eat standing up?"
"RORY: Over there."
"[they sit at the table. Emily walks into the room]"
"EMILY: The roast looks perfect. Oh, Jess, you eat meat, I hope. I forgot to ask."
"JESS: I'm a carnivore."
"EMILY: Good. I don't see how anybody can resist eating meat."
"JESS: It's why we have teeth."
"EMILY: That's how I feel. Dinner parties used to be simple. Now every time we give one, I have to run my menu down with every person on the list. It's tiring. This one eats just about anything."
"RORY: Grandma."
"EMILY: I'm sorry, but the way you and your mother eat, and those slim figures of yours  it's a medical marvel."
"JESS: They should be studied."
"RORY: I don't think so."
"EMILY: So, Rory tells me you're part of the Wal-Mart corporation."
"JESS: Only out of necessity."
"EMILY: They sound like wonderful stores."
"JESS: Oh, yeah, I wanna be buried there."
"EMILY: We've never actually been inside one, but we own the stock."
"JESS: Thanks for the paycheck."
"EMILY: Oh, that's very funny."
"RORY: Did you just get it?"
"JESS: Huh?"
"RORY: The eye  did it just happen?"
"JESS: You know, we should eat these salads so the roast doesn't get cold."
"RORY: I mean, it must be sometime between nine last night and now."
"EMILY: Hm?"
"RORY: His eye."
"JESS: Yeah, it was sometime in there."
"RORY: But you can't narrow it down?"
"JESS: Rory, come on."
"EMILY: Oh my God, there's no salt and pepper on this table. We'll need it for the meat. These people are supposed to be trained before I get them, but God knows that's never the case. [leaves room]"
"JESS: What is your problem?"
"RORY: You're not telling me the truth, that's my problem."
"JESS: I don't wanna get into it here."
"RORY: And it's obvious why."
"JESS: Oh, is it?"
"RORY: You got into a fight with Dean."
"JESS: Unbelievable."
"RORY: Is that it?"
"JESS: It always comes back to Dean."
"RORY: Because you bring it there."
"JESS: You brought up Dean."
"RORY: Because you got into a fight with him."
"JESS: Why are you pressing this? Why? I'm trying to make some kind of quasi-positive impression on your grandmother per your request and you're forcing me to do otherwise. And what the hell are raisins doing in a salad? Why can't people leave well enough alone?"
"RORY: Well, in that whole speech, I didn't hear you deny it."
"[Emily walks back into the room]"
"EMILY: We've got great choices on the prime rib. How do you like your prime rib, Jess?"
"JESS: Cooked."
"RORY: He's not picky, Grandma."
"EMILY: Good, that'll make it easier. So, what did I miss?"
"JESS: Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
"RORY: Grandma, would it be all right if I speak to Jess for a second? We can go to the study."
"JESS: We're eating."
"RORY: Well, I want to talk."
"JESS: You're being a little rude to your grandmother, Rory."
"EMILY: I can leave the room for a minute if you want."
"RORY: No, Grandma, we'll be right back."
"[Rory and Jess walk to the study]"
"RORY: I told you nothing happened at Patty's, but you just wouldn't believe it. You had to get into a fight with Dean tonight right before meeting my grandmother. This is a disaster."
"JESS: I did not get into a fight with Dean."
"RORY: Bull."
"JESS: Believe what you want."
"RORY: I'm going to find out eventually, so why keep it from me?"
"JESS: What if Dean had sucker-punched me and I had to defend myself? You're not even considering the possibility that that's what happened?"
"RORY: Dean wouldn't do that."
"JESS: Oh, no, he might get his big white Stetson dirty."
"RORY: You're being a jerk to my grandmother, too."
"JESS: Hey, I'm doing my best. If that means I'm being a jerk, then that's what I am. I didn't even wanna come."
"RORY: No one made you."
"JESS: You made me. Now I've seen it all."
"RORY: You embarrassed me in front of her."
"JESS: That's it, I've had it."
"RORY: So have I."
"JESS: If you're gonna harp on this, I'm leaving."
"RORY: Oh, great, so now I have to explain to my Grandma why my boyfriend who showed up a half-hour late with a black eye is walking out."
"JESS: Well, you like making up stories in your head so that should be easy for you."
"[they walk to the front door. Jess leaves. Emily walks up to Rory]"
"EMILY: Is he fetching something from his car?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"EMILY: He left."
"RORY: Yeah, he left."
"EMILY: Well, you can take some prime rib back for him if you want. What do you say the girls have some dinner, huh?"
"CUT TO NEW YORK"
"[Lorelai, Alex, Sookie, and Jackson walk out of the theater]"
"JACKSON: So, good, good show."
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. Alex, thank you for getting us those tickets."
"SOOKIE: Great production value."
"JACKSON: Oh, amazing. I mean, the way they do lighting on these things."
"SOOKIE: It's magical, it's magical."
"ALEX: This is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen."
"LORELAI: What?"
"ALEX: I saw Moose m*rder. This stinks worse."
"SOOKIE: I thought it was me."
"JACKSON: I was dying in there."
"LORELAI: Every song is the same."
"SOOKIE: The same two notes."
"LORELAI: How does that happen?"
"SOOKIE: I feel so very bad. Yes, I feel so very sad."
"LORELAI: I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm mad."
"SOOKIE: I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm sad."
"JACKSON: I'm sorry  that's better, rent a theater."
"ALEX: Look, I say we hit a bar, get some drinks, continue plotting out this musical you guys are writing."
"LORELAI: Cool. We'll need pens and paper."
"SOOKIE: Just memorize it. I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm sad."
"JACKSON: We'll grab a cab."
"SOOKIE: Hey, that fits right in."
"[Sookie and Jackson walk away to hail a cab]"
"LORELAI: You're nice."
"ALEX: I try."
"[Lorelai pulls out her cell phone]"
"ALEX: Who are you expecting?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory. I mean, not that I'm expecting a call because a call could mean something bad, so, um, not getting a call is probably best."
"ALEX: Probably."
"LORELAI: I'm just gonna give her a call."
"ALEX: You know, on the drive down here, you made me promise to stop you if you were gonna call Rory for the wrong reason."
"LORELAI: But I left the iron on."
"ALEX: She'll turn it off."
"LORELAI: She's got this boy."
"ALEX: I know."
"LORELAI: I shouldn't call her."
"ALEX: It's up to you."
"JACKSON: Hey guys, we got a cab, and the driver likes our song."
"LORELAI: Putting away phone now."
"ALEX: Good girl."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Rory is asleep in bed. Her cell phone rings and wakes her up]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Good morning."
"RORY: Hey. It's early. Why are you calling so early?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. I must've screwed up the time difference. What time is it there?"
"RORY: The same time it is there."
"LORELAI: Ah, sorry."
"RORY: How's it going?"
"LORELAI: Good. A lot of walking. We all had pizza at John's in the village and wrote a musical."
"RORY: Good for you."
"LORELAI: Then we picked the same Dean Martin song on the jukebox twenty-five times and people started complaining, so we picked the Bee Gees' ""New York Mining Disaster"" and they begged for Dean Martin back."
"RORY: Sounds fun."
"LORELAI: So, how'd the dinner go?"
"RORY: Uh, not well. Far from well."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I'm at Grandma's."
"LORELAI: You stayed the night?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: What did she do? Did she make you stay because she didn't want Jess to drive you home? She is so untrusting. And to ruin this dinner  I'm gonna k*ll her."
"RORY: No, Grandma was great. The whole time, even when Jess was late."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"RORY: She was a saint. Staying over was my idea."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Jess and I got into the most horrible fight of my life and it was. . .ugh. I can't even say."
"LORELAI: I don't believe this."
"RORY: He showed up with a big black eye."
"LORELAI: A black guy?"
"RORY: Eye, a black eye. He got into a fight."
"LORELAI: With who, Dean?"
"RORY: He wouldn't say, but yes, and he was all standoffish about it and things got worse and worse and he walked out. It was all horrible."
"LORELAI: Wow, honey. I'm sorry. Are you okay?"
"RORY: I'm upset, but I'm okay."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"EMILY: Oh, I thought I heard you up. How bout some breakfast?"
"RORY: Sure."
"EMILY: Is that Jess?"
"RORY: No, it's Mom."
"LORELAI: Hey, put her on."
"RORY: She wants to talk to you. Bye."
"LORELAI: See ya tonight."

"EMILY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Mom, hi, listen. Rory kind of explained what happened last night, and how you were really great about it. I just wanted to thank you. I mean, I don't know all the details, but I'm sure it all could've been way worse, and you keeping your cool like that was really, really nice. Thanks."
"EMILY: How can you let your daughter be with that abominable thug?"
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: First he arrives late, how disrespectful is that? Then he's rude to Rory, rude to me."
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: Oh, and that attitude  I wanted to slap that monosyllabic mouth of his. And God forbid they're in another accident together or his heap of a car breaks down and Lord Jim has decided cell phones are beneath him and they're stranded in the middle of nowhere. How can you let this happen? He had a black eye. He belongs in jail!"
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Dave, Zach, and Brian drive down the street and stop at a stop light. Dave turns off the car radio]"
"ZACH: Yo, dude, that's disrespectful."
"DAVE: We're really early. Let's get something to eat."
"ZACH: Sure, what do we want?"
"BRIAN: I've only got three bucks."
"ZACH: You always only got three bucks. What is it, you go to an ATM that only gives out three bucks at a time?"
"DAVE: Let's just pick."
"BRIAN: Well, I'm sick of burgers, so if it could be a place that has more than burgers "
"ZACH: What do you want, like a three-dollar sushi place?"
"BRIAN: It doesn't have to be sushi."
"[Dave sees Mrs. Kim walking toward them]"
"DAVE: Guys, shut up and be cool. Don't say a thing."
"BRIAN: What, why?"
"DAVE: Mrs. Kim, hello."
"MRS. KIM: David."
"ZACH: David?"
"BRIAN: Mrs. Kim. You're Lane's mom?"
"MRS. KIM: How do you know Lane?"
"ZACH: She's a great dr "
"DAVE: Girl. We all think so."
"MRS. KIM: Who are you? What is all this, David? Who are all these unwashed boys?"
"DAVE: Well, see, Zach and Brian here play in a combo with me when I don't play solo."
"MRS. KIM: A combo?"
"DAVE: A Christian combo."
"MRS. KIM: Oh, good. With just a guitar it can sound thin."
"DAVE: Well, that's why we play music together. Uh, the light's turned, we should probably get "
"MRS. KIM: Wait, I want to warn you about something."
"DAVE: Yes?"
"MRS. KIM: About Lane. She has a crush on you."
"DAVE: She does?"
"MRS. KIM: I thought you should know. She's a good girl, but flighty sometimes. Be careful around her. I know you're a serious boy, I don't want you to be shocked."
"DAVE: Oh, no, thank you. I'll be very careful, I promise."
"MRS. KIM: Okay. Maybe I'll book your combo sometime, mix it up a little."
"DAVE: It would be our pleasure. Right, guys?"
"ZACH: Yeah."
"BRIAN: Sure."
"MRS. KIM: Don't speed. [walks away]"
"DAVE: Okay, so, uh, where do we wanna eat?"
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Rory walks up to Dean]"
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: Hey there. Did you see those fliers? Apparently, I clicked my heels for joy after one of her songs. I don't remember that."
"RORY: Me neither. Can I talk to you for a sec?"
"DEAN: Well, yeah, what's wrong?"
"RORY: Dean, this whole friend thing with us isn't going to work if we're not honest with each other."
"DEAN: I agree."
"RORY: Okay, so, anything you wanna tell me?"
"DEAN: Corn's two for a dollar?"
"RORY: Jess has a black eye."
"DEAN: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Any idea where he got it?"
"DEAN: That would be an extremely long list."
"RORY: It wasn't you?"
"DEAN: It wasn't me."
"RORY: You swear?"
"DEAN: I swear. Did he say it was me?"
"RORY: No, he's not saying anything. He's less talkative than some."
"DEAN: Yeah, sorry, I have no idea. Look, I really don't like talking about "
"RORY: I know, sorry, I "
"DEAN: I should get back to work."
"RORY: Okay, thanks."
"DEAN: Sorry I couldn't solve the mystery."
"RORY: Me, too."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is behind the counter, Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"LUKE: Whoa."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: You're Petey the dog."
"JESS: I prefer to not talk about this."
"LUKE: Is that why you snuck in last night?"
"JESS: I did not sneak in. Now, could we get back to work here?"
"LUKE: Fine, start clearing some stuff. So when'd you get into a fight with Dean?"
"JESS: It wasn't a fight with Dean."
"LUKE: Whoa, where's that coming from? I just asked."
"JESS: What's with everybody making assumptions? I'm sick of it."
"LUKE: So it wasn't Dean."
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: When did it happen, yesterday?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: You went to Rory's grandmother yesterday. She punch you?"
"JESS: Stop."
"LUKE: Where'd you get it?"
"JESS: Santa Claus."
"LUKE: So you're not gonna tell me?"
"JESS: That's right."
"[phone rings]"
"LUKE: [answers] Hello? Yeah, hey Rory, hang on a sec. [to Jess] It's Rory."
"JESS: I'm not here."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: Get a clue, Columbo. I don't wanna talk to her."
"LUKE: You don't wanna talk to Rory? [to Rory] Yeah, Rory? Yeah, he just went someplace. Yeah, I'll tell him. Bye."
"[Luke hangs up the phone, then grabs Jess by his shirt]"
"LUKE: Come on."
"JESS: Hey."
"[Luke pulls him to the storage room]"
"JESS: Come on, what is this?"
"LUKE: Look, you're my responsibility. You're exhibiting signs of violent behavior and I don't care how much you don't wanna talk about it, you're not leaving until you tell me. Now, tell me, where'd you get the black eye?"
"JESS: You wouldn't believe it anyway."
"LUKE: Try me, tough guy."
"JESS: A swan."
"LUKE: Excuse me?"
"JESS: I was attacked by a swan. Okay, you happy? A stupid swan."
"LUKE: Now, how bout the real story?"
"JESS: That is the real story. It hangs out by Larson's Dock. I was just walking by and the thing came out of nowhere and bam  beaked me right in the eye."
"LUKE: It beaked you?"
"JESS: You still don't believe me."
"LUKE: I just never heard anyone use the word beaked as a verb before."
"JESS: No, no, this isn't funny. That stupid bird attacked me. He could've blinded me. It's a vicious, vicious bird, and . . .fine. Forget it."
"[they walk back into the diner. Jess retrieves a ladle from under the counter]"
"LUKE: What are you doing? Where are you going?"
"JESS: I'm gonna do a little beaking of my own."
"LUKE: Jess, not the ladle. That's a brand new ladle. Take the baster!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Luke and Jess are in a rowboat in the middle of the lake]"
"LUKE: I don't see a swan."
"JESS: Put your oars down."
"LUKE: They don't like oars?"
"JESS: Just lay low, it'll come."
"LUKE: Does it act all peaceful and Bambi-like and then suddenly attack like the rabbit in Monty Python?"
"JESS: Your voice is probably scaring it away."
"LUKE: So how'd you explain the black eye to the Gilmores?"
"JESS: I didn't. The whole night sucked. I'm happy it's behind me."
"LUKE: Behind you? You ain't got nothing behind you."
"JESS: What do you mean?"
"LUKE: You'll have plenty more events like that in your future."
"JESS: No way."
"LUKE: When you date a girl like Rory, you're involved with her whole family. Just like that last girl you dated, you were involved with her whole petri dish."
"JESS: At least she was easy to figure out."
"LUKE: And you were bored from day one."
"JESS: I'm dating Rory, not her family."
"LUKE: All these people come in a package with this girl. The mother comes with this girl. The grandmother comes with this girl."
"JESS: And apparently a bunch of others. Everybody she's ever met, including Dean."
"LUKE: She picked you."
"JESS: God knows why."
"LUKE: She knows, that's all that matters. Jess, being jealous of Dean "
"JESS: I am not jealous of Dean."
"LUKE: Being jealous of Dean is pointless. You're just gonna drive Rory away. You wanna have a relationship with someone, you're gonna have to learn to open up your mouth and say something."
"JESS: Give it a rest, Dr. Phil."
"LUKE: You can't shut down, you can't avoid her calls."
"JESS: I didn't wanna talk."
"LUKE: Well, when are you gonna wanna talk?"
"JESS: I don't know."
"LUKE: So, what are you gonna do, just keep avoiding her and never take her calls again?"
"JESS: She'll find me eventually."
"LUKE: If she keeps looking for you."
"JESS: Hey, I'm not gonna be a wuss like Dean."
"LUKE: Dean had that girl for two years. You have a little fight after two months, you walk out, and it's over?"
"JESS: I don't care."
"LUKE: Okay, fine, you don't care, that's obvious."
"[Jess sees a swan]"
"JESS: Shh!"
"LUKE: Is that the one?"
"JESS: That's it. Watch it."
"LUKE: I'm watching it. It's pretty."
"JESS: Shh!"
"LUKE: Is it gonna double back?"
"JESS: Maybe."
"LUKE: So it's lulling us into complacency."
"JESS: He's vicious, I'm telling you."
"LUKE: Yeah, his butt's terrifying."
"JESS: It's outnumbered. That's the problem. It knows there's two of us."
"LUKE: So you want me to get under water, swim along with the boat, breathe through a straw?"
"JESS: Forget it."
"LUKE: Maybe it's gonna get another swan and come back and make a fight of it, huh?"
"JESS: Forget it."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S GARAGE"
"[Rory is talking to Lane as she sets up for band practice]"
"LANE: He's not even calling you back, huh?"
"RORY: No, and I'm not sure what to do."
"LANE: Well, Dave and I have never had a fight because we haven't really truly g*n dating, so I have no perspective on this."
"RORY: Well, you'd better hurry up and start having bad boy troubles so I can get some feedback."
"[The band walks into the garage]"
"DAVE: Hey there."
"LANE: Hi guys."
"RORY: How's it going?"
"ZACH: I think it's going a little weird, to tell you the truth."
"LANE: Weird, why?"
"BRIAN: I think we need to get something out in the open here."
"ZACH: Definitely."
"DAVE: We ran into your mom."
"LANE: My mom?"
"RORY: Oh boy."
"ZACH: Yeah, and we're well aware that there's a situation here that you guys have been hiding."
"BRIAN: We should get it out in the open here or else it's gonna get weirder."
"DAVE: Yeah, I guess so. We didn't mean anything by hiding it guys."
"ZACH: Well, what pisses us off is that you felt you had to hide it."
"DAVE: Really?"
"ZACH: Yeah. Dave, you're a Christian. So what? That's cool."
"BRIAN: It's nothing to hide."
"ZACH: Christians can still rock."
"DAVE: They can?"
"LANE: Yeah, yeah, Dave. Christians can still rock, don't hide it."
"ZACH: Marshall Stacks don't know Christians from atheists."
"DAVE: Gosh, I just wasn't sure if you guys would be accepting of my devoutness."
"BRIAN: Dave, it's a part of you, and we think you're cool, so it's cool."
"DAVE: Great. Thanks, guys."
"ZACH: But no way are we playing Creed, man."
"DAVE: Oh, no, of course not."
"ZACH: Or Amy Grant. That's where we draw the line."
"LANE: This is very accepting of you guys."
"BRIAN: And we'd be totally into playing that gig for your mom if it pays."
"LANE: Oh, Mrs. Kim pays. Uh, she's very good about that."
"[a car horn honks from the yard]"
"RORY: That's my mom. I'm glad this all worked out."
"LANE: Yeah, me too."
"[Rory walks to the front yard. Alex is getting Lorelai's suitcase out of the trunk of his SUV]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Oh, my little daughter."
"RORY: I'm happy to see you. Thanks for bringing her back in one piece."
"ALEX: No problem."
"LORELAI: I'm very weak."
"ALEX: She hasn't eaten in awhile."
"RORY: I warned you to keep to her feeding schedule."
"LORELAI: I'm drifting, drifting."
"ALEX: She wanted to wait to have dinner with you."
"RORY: That's sweet."
"LORELAI: Must have food now."
"RORY: I'll take it from here."
"ALEX: Thanks."
"LORELAI: Bye. [to Rory] You're not food."
"ALEX: Revive her."
"RORY: I will. I'm gonna run and get take out."
"LORELAI: Oh, make like the wind."
"RORY: Can you make it to the door?"
"LORELAI: I'll struggle."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Rory walks by the diner with some takeout bags. Jess walks out]"
"JESS: Rory."
"RORY: Oh, hey."
"JESS: Hey. Your mom home?"
"RORY: I'm bringing supplies."
"JESS: Should've brought a mule."
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: A pack mule, to carry it."
"RORY: Oh, yeah."
"JESS: So, sorry I missed your calls."
"RORY: You were always out."
"JESS: Yeah. I was getting ready to call you just now, but you would've been out."
"RORY: Ironic."
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: So, I know there was no fight with Dean."
"JESS: Really? How? You asked Dean."
"RORY: It was the only thing I could think to do."
"JESS: To go to the source."
"RORY: Yup. I'm sorry I doubted you."
"JESS: It's okay. I would've doubted me, too."
"RORY: I need to trust you as much as I trusted "
"JESS: Him."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: This black eye screwed everything up."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Next time I go to your grandmother's, I'll try not to have one."
"RORY: Next time?"
"JESS: Next time."
"RORY: So what happened?"
"JESS: I don't "
"RORY: Come on. It wasn't Dean, you can say."
"JESS: Will that make you happy?"
"RORY: Yes, very."
"JESS: Okay, I'll tell you the truth, since we're both so into the truth tonight. That's what good relationships are about, right?"
"RORY: Right."
"JESS: But you've gotta promise not to mock me ever, and please don't tell anyone else."
"RORY: Promise."
"JESS: I was throwing a football with a buddy and got hit in the eye."
"RORY: You poor thing."
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: But that's not embarrassing."
"JESS: Yeah, now that you mention it, it's not."
"RORY: I have to go."
"JESS: Don't go."
"RORY: I don't want to."
"JESS: Then don't. Let's go somewhere."
"RORY: I've got takeout."
"JESS: I'll reimburse you."
"RORY: My mom's waiting. Keep thinking what you're thinking."
"JESS: I don't have a choice."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is lying on the couch, Rory walks in with the takeout]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Hm? Is that you, Rhett?"
"RORY: I bring food."
"LORELAI: Oh, thank God. Ha! One of everything at Al's. Bless you with gluttony. Aren't you hungry?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Well, come on, dig in. What's wrong?"
"RORY: Nothing. Um, listen."
"LORELAI: I'm listening."
"RORY: When I said before that I was too busy to think about it, I realized now that I'm not too busy to think about it."
"LORELAI: Think about it?"
"RORY: About it."
"LORELAI: Oh, it."
"RORY: Yeah, it."
"LORELAI: Ha, it."
"RORY: Nothing's happened yet, but. . .it might. Maybe."
"LORELAI: Maybe?"
"RORY: Maybe. . .with Jess."
"LORELAI: Hm, with Jess."
"RORY: You still want me to tell you everything, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Uh, no. Well "
"RORY: Which is it?"
"LORELAI: We're doing this now."
"RORY: Yes. Which is it?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: You'll let me know?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Was that, yeah, you'll let me know, or yeah, that's your answer, you wanna know?"
"LORELAI: I guess, I wanna know, yes, and now, sure."
"RORY: Well, nothing's happened."
"LORELAI: I heard."
"RORY: But it might."
"LORELAI: Okay. Could you tell me before it does?"
"RORY: Right before, or "
"LORELAI: No, just. . .just before."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. Is that it?"
"RORY: For tonight, yeah."
"LORELAI: Good. This. . .this is good."
"RORY: Yeah, it is good."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, let's eat."
"RORY: Good."
"[They start eating. Lorelai puts her arm around Rory. Rory puts her arm around Lorelai. They continue eating.]"

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table with Taylor]"
"TAYLOR: So, I have talked to every member of my family and we agreed that you can hold the rooms on my credit card, but everyone must check out with their own."
"LORELAI: Got it."
"TAYLOR: Have we gone over the room arrangements yet?"
"LORELAI: Closing in on a hundred and fifty times."
"TAYLOR: Well, the Doose clan is very, very particular about their accommodations. We are light sleepers and are prone to night terrors, and several of us are very allergic to bed clothing, so it's very important that we are "
"LORELAI: On the first floor or near a fire escape. Yes, Taylor, I know, it's all taken care of. Um, Taylor, could you just hang on a second? I'll be right back."
"TAYLOR: Oh, all right, but hurry. I don't have all day."
"[Lorelai walks to the counter where Rory is talking to Jess]"
"LORELAI: Hey. You were supposed to bring me a cup of coffee."
"RORY: Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I got distracted."
"JESS: My fault."
"LORELAI: Yes, but see, when you left me there, I was alone, and now, look, I'm no longer alone."
"RORY: Taylor found you?"
"LORELAI: Yes, and we've since embarked on hour one hundred millionth of planning the special Doose reunion."
"RORY: I'm coming back over there right now."
"LORELAI: Yes, and then you are going to get very sick and be unable to feed yourself so that Mommy will need to take you home and stay by your side until the Doose reunion is over."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay. Say goodbye to Jess."
"RORY: Bye Jess."
"JESS: I'll call you later."
"LORELAI: Oh, limp a little if you can."
"RORY: Uh, what malady do I have that makes me limp and lose ability to feed myself?"
"LORELAI: It's French."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they walk over to Taylor]"
"LORELAI: Taylor, listen, we're gonna need to finish this up a little later. Rory's not feeling so good."
"TAYLOR: Oh no, what's the matter?"
"RORY: It's French."
"TAYLOR: All right. Well, I think we're just about done here anyhow. Oh, before I forget, let me give you each one of these. [hands them each a button]"
"RORY: [reads button] ""Stars Hollow Hockey, 2003 semifinalists. Go Minutemen. The future is yours. Bring this button to Doose's for fifty percent off your next purchase of Stove Top Stuffing."" Wow, that's a lot of words for a tiny button."
"TAYLOR: I expect to see both of you wearing them at the game tomorrow night."
"LORELAI: Well, we'll try to make it."
"TAYLOR: Try to make it? My dear, do you realize that this is the first time we've been in the regional semifinals in forty-three years?"
"RORY: But didn't we only make it this far because the Litchfield team got food poisoning?"
"TAYLOR: Well, I admit it's not exactly the plot of Hoosiers, but still it's very, very exciting."
"LORELAI: Well, it's nice that you and your family are so loyal to the home team."
"TAYLOR: Oh, the Dooses have been the backbone of Stars Hollow High hockey for years. I, myself, was the goalkeeper for our team in the last regional finals."
"LORELAI: I did not know that."
"TAYLOR: Oh yes. I was responsible for the game-winning goal."
"LUKE: So the puck just ricocheted off your head and into the net?"
"TAYLOR: Still counted."
"LUKE: For God's sake, I was making a joke. You really got pucked in the head?"
"TAYLOR: No, I was making a joke, too. Uh, Lorelai, just one more "
"[Taylor looks out the window and sees Lorelai and Rory running down the street]"
"TAYLOR: What a disgrace, making that poor sick girl run."
"LUKE: Wow, you can see the dent."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Richard are eating dinner]"
"RICHARD: So, Rory, how are things at Chilton?"
"RORY: Great, great, everything's great."
"RICHARD: And, uh, Lorelai, things at the inn are good?"
"LORELAI: Mm, mmhmm, hm."
"RICHARD: Oh, Rory, please slow down and chew your food properly."
"LORELAI: I'm always telling her that. Pass the butter."
"RORY: Pass the peas."
"LORELAI: Pass the pork."
"RORY: Pass your plate."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, is there a race going on I don't know about?"
"[Emily walks into the room]"
"EMILY: That was your mother, Richard. She just wanted to make sure that all our towels are Egyptian cotton."
"RICHARD: Well, it's a simple question."
"EMILY: It's her fortieth simple question of the day."
"RICHARD: Well, she's going to be staying with us, Emily. She just wants to know she'll be comfortable."
"EMILY: Yes, because we usually give our guests the towels we've stolen from the Holiday Inn."
"RORY: Great Grandma's coming to stay with you?"
"RICHARD: Just for a few days, um, while her floors are being redone."
"LORELAI: So, how's Gran doing?"
"RORY: Yeah, does she miss London?"
"EMILY: Not half as much as I do."
"RICHARD: Emily."
"EMILY: I never really truly appreciated the Atlantic Ocean before. Three thousand lovely miles of water."
"RICHARD: You are talking about my mother."
"EMILY: I know that, Richard. And I'm happy to have her stay here, but must she keep interrupting the one dinner a week that we have with Lorelai and Rory? She knows what time we dine  and why are you two eating so quickly?"
"LORELAI: We're not eating quickly."
"RORY: Yeah, you've been on the phone for awhile. It probably just seems like we've eaten a lot."
"[phone rings]"
"EMILY: I wonder who that could be."
"RICHARD: Emily."
"[doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: Well, aren't we popular? Richard, perhaps you could get that while I have another bath sheet versus bath towel debate with your mother."
"[Richard and Emily leave the room]"
"LORELAI: You're giving it away!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You're eating too quickly."
"RORY: What? You said that we had to be out of here by 8:30."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but I didn't tell you to broadcast it."
"RORY: I'm eating at the same speed you are."
"LORELAI: But you're eating small bites very fast. You've gotta eat bigger bites at a normal speed."
"RORY: You mean I should risk choking so we can make our Friday night plans?"
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"[Richard returns to the table]"
"RICHARD: I apologize for that."
"LORELAI: Collection agency again?"
"RICHARD: Excuse me?"
"[Emily returns to the room]"
"EMILY: Thank goodness she called. Richard, did you know people actually expect there to be soap in their bathrooms when they. . ."
"[Emily hears a noise. She looks into the living room and sees two men carrying a mattress up the steps]"
"EMILY: Why are there strange men hauling a mattress up my staircase?"
"RICHARD: Well, now, Emily "
"EMILY: She sent her own mattress?"
"RICHARD: Well, she has a very sensitive back."
"EMILY: She sent her own mattress?"
"RICHARD: I'll go and supervise. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Well, Mom, it looks like you got a lot going on here."
"RORY: With the mattresses and the phone calls."
"LORELAI: Yeah, so we're just gonna go and get out of your hair."
"EMILY: Hold it right there. What is going on with you two?"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"EMILY: You know exactly what I'm talking about. Bolting down your food, leaving before dessert, Rory checking her pager every five minutes. What do you have planned? Fine, we'll just sit here until one of you feels like filling me in."
"LORELAI: She has a date!"
"RORY: So does she!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, but hers starts a half-hour earlier than mine!"
"RORY: Because you get to stay out later!"
"LORELAI: Because I'm the mom!"
"EMILY: You two, stop it right now! You're behaving like children."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: Yeah, sorry."
"EMILY: Our deal is for Friday night dinners, not appearances at Friday night dinners. Now, you will sit there and you will eat your dessert."
"LORELAI: But "
"EMILY: One more word and I throw in a game of charades."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Yes, Mom."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory rush into the house]"
"LORELAI: Oh, we gotta get a faster car!"
"RORY: Hey, don't blame the car."
"LORELAI: So you're saying it's my fault we're late?"
"RORY: Who was the one who said, ""Hey, I've got room for another piece of pie."""
"[Lorelai goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Ah! You kept making all that pointless conversation, all those thank you's and please's. What, are you running for Miss Congeniality?"
"RORY: Just get ready."
"LORELAI: What time are you meeting Jess?"
"RORY: I don't know, I'll tell you in a sec. [checks answering machine]"
"LORELAI: Have you seen my brown boots? I cannot go out without those brown boots. My entire outfit was retrofitted around those practically  Oh! Wait, can you believe it? Hey, they were in my closet. What sort of bizarre accident of fate put them there?"
"[Lorelai walks back downstairs]"
"LORELAI: What? He didn't call? Well, maybe it's too early. What time is it?"
"RORY: 9:15."
"LORELAI: And when did he say he would call?"
"RORY: When he got off work."
"LORELAI: Which was when?"
"RORY: It varies."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I thought you guys had a plan."
"RORY: We did."
"LORELAI: And the plan was that he calls you whenever because his work time varies?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Good plan. Bay of Pigs, was that yours, too?"
"RORY: He'll call."
"LORELAI: Hey, look, you wanna come out with me and Alex? We might go see a midnight movie if something really bad is playing."
"RORY: No, thanks."
"LORELAI: Just promise me you won't sit here all night staring at the phone."
"RORY: [turns on TV] Happy?"
"LORELAI: Delirious. Oh, I should not have had that second piece of pie."
"RORY: Full?"
"LORELAI: No, just late."
"RORY: Bring me some Milk Duds."
"LORELAI: It's a plan!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the town square]"
"RORY: Then I spent about forty minutes cleaning out my hard drive. You would not believe the amount of junk that accumulates  old files, things you've downloaded but never opened. It really slows down your CPU."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I hate a slow CPU."
"RORY: Then, all of a sudden, I looked down and I saw all this hair and dust between the keys of my keyboard."
"LORELAI: So, naturally, you cleaned your keyboard."
"RORY: Yes, and I'll tell you, it was a strangely satisfying experience."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. One question. During this time that you watched TV, did homework, proofread articles for The Franklin, organized my sock drawer, returned emails and gave a much needed cleaning to your computer, did it ever occur to you to call him?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because he said he'd call me."
"LORELAI: Right. Okay, so then I'm guessing you're not gonna mention anything to him about your extremely productive evening alone when you see him either."
"RORY: Why should I?"
"LORELAI: No reason I can think of."
"[They stop to look at Stars Hollow High, which has been toilet papered by a rival school]"
"LORELAI: You know, I almost like it better like this."
"RORY: It is more festive."
"[they see Dean on a ladder helping remove the toilet paper]"
"LORELAI: Good luck tonight!"
"RORY: Sure, when Dean said he'd call, he always called, but where's the fun in that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, don't do that."
"RORY: Do what?"
"LORELAI: Compare Dean and Jess, that's not fair. They're different people."
"RORY: Clearly. One calls when he says he will and one doesn't."
"LORELAI: Okay, for starters, I think you have to realize something  you were really lucky with Dean. He was an exceptional first boyfriend, and you got spoiled. Most of us didn't have first boyfriends like Dean. Most of us had first boyfriends like Brian Hutchins."
"RORY: Brian Hutchins?"
"LORELAI: Seventh grade, I'm sitting in the library, walks up, asks me to go steady. I say yes. He walks away and I don't see him again until the tenth grade when he tries to sell me a dimebag at the Sadies Hawkins Day dance. And he was way overcharging for it, too."
"RORY: That's demented."
"LORELAI: Well, that's what most of us had to put up with. Where do you think the Susan Faludi's of the world came from?"
"RORY: So, you're telling me this is just the way it is, and I have to get used to Jess not calling when he says he will?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm saying you just have to realize that every guy is different. Give Jess a chance to explain before you freeze him out."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they walk into the diner]"
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: Hey. That table's clean if you want it. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Well, I hope that cleared it up for you."
"RORY: Not a word. Not even a lame-o apology that is obviously a lie."
"LORELAI: Yeah, how dare he not lie to you."
"LUKE: Finally, two people who don't give a damn about hockey."
"LORELAI: Oh, someone's testy."
"LUKE: Well, just look at these dippy people with their buttons and their pennants. You'd think the town had never been in a semi-regional playoff before."
"RORY: But hasn't it been like forty years?"
"LUKE: Yeah, for the hockey team, yeah. But back when I was on the track team, we went to state three times in four years and won it twice. Think they made buttons and put up banners? They couldn't care less."
"LORELAI: Well, Luke, that's because track is for dorks."
"RORY: Yeah, it's true. I'm sorry."
"LUKE: Okay, the conversing part of this morning is now over. What do you want?"
"LORELAI: Jack omelet, bacon on the side."
"RORY: Three blueberry and two lemon poppy seed muffins to go. Lane's band is rehearsing at my house. I wanted to bring them something."
"LUKE: You got that, Jess?"
"JESS: Yup."
"LUKE: Be right back."
"JESS: Five muffins to go."
"RORY: Thank you. I'll see you later. [leaves]"
"JESS: What was that, you guys in a fight or something?"
"LORELAI: No, you are."
"JESS: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: Last night, didn't you guys have plans to do something?"
"JESS: I don't know. I just said I'd call her after work."
"LORELAI: And did you?"
"JESS: I had to work another shift, I didn't get off until midnight. It was too late to call."
"LORELAI: And you couldn't have taken two seconds at work to call and tell her that?"
"JESS: No."
"LORELAI: Really? You don't get breaks? Do you get food, water? Should I get Michael Moore on the phone?"
"JESS: Whatever. I gotta unload some boxes. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Nice talking to you."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory and Lane walk out of the house toward the garage, where the band is practicing]"
"LANE: See, I knew once my mom found out Dave was part of a Christian trio, it was only a matter of time before she booked him to play at one of her prayer meetings."
"RORY: It's perfect. Now your mom's gonna get to know the whole band."
"LANE: Not just get to know them, but love them the way she loves Dave."
"RORY: Your mom loves Dave?"
"LANE: She said he's a righteous young man who's proven he can be trusted around antique furniture. In her book, that's pretty close to love."
"RORY: Oh, sure."
"ZACH: [sings] ""A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing."" Dude, what's a bulwark?"
"BRIAN: What?"
"ZACH: It says, a bulwark never failing."
"BRIAN: I think it's a wall."
"ZACH: Then why don't they just say that? Bulwark sounds totally gay."
"BRIAN: I don't think you're supposed to call a hymn gay. It's like a sin or something."
"ZACH: Whatever, man. I'm not saying bulwark."
"RORY: So, Dave, Lane just gets to sit back and watch you guys play tonight, huh? You're like a groupie."
"DAVE: No, actually, she's got a date."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah. Remember Young Chui, the guy my mom introduced me to at the wedding? She arranged for him to take me to the hockey game tonight."
"RORY: Oh."
"DAVE: It's the first of three dates."
"RORY: The first of three?"
"DAVE: Then he's gonna dump her."
"RORY: Young Chui, the guy you haven't gone out with yet?"
"LANE: Yes. And I'll be crushed, making my mom feel so guilty about setting me up with him that she'll have to let me go out with Dave to make up for it."
"DAVE: I came up with that twist."
"LANE: Dave has a natural gift for subterfuge."
"DAVE: Wow, a compliment from the master. [walks away]"
"LANE: I would've thought of it myself, but I let him take the credit."
"RORY: Men sometimes need that."
"ZACH: I'm telling you dude, it doesn't make any sense."
"BRIAN: Fine, stop yelling at me. I didn't write it."
"DAVE: Whoa, whoa. Uh, what's wrong?"
"ZACH: This stupid song, man. ""For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe."" I mean, who talks like that, the Pope?"
"BRIAN: Dude, is any of those lemon poppy seed?"
"DAVE: Well, can't you update it a little?"
"ZACH: Sure, man. Just tell me what the hell it means. It's like in Latin or something."
"BRIAN: I thought there was gonna be coffee, too."
"ZACH: Dude, can you chill out about your freaking elevensees til we get this song straightened out?"
"BRIAN: I'm hypoglycemic. If I don't get something in my system, I'm gonna crash."
"DAVE: Is abi-death a word?"
"RORY: But how are you gonna make Young Chui dump you? Just be a really bad date?"
"LANE: Oh, no, we've already talked to him. He's totally on board."
"RORY: Really?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah. See, he's in love with this Japanese girl named Karen who his parents don't approve of, so he and Karen see each other secretly while his parents keep setting him up with nice Korean girls. He's the male me."
"RORY: Gotcha."
"LANE: Hey, you and Jess should come with us to the game tonight. It'll be fun."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm not sure what we're doing tonight."
"ZACH: [sings] ""A mighty fortress is our God, a wall ten stories high. And he helps us when things get bad and the devil tries to hurt us."""
"RORY: What hymn is that?"
"LANE: I have no idea."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Taylor is in the lobby talking to his family]"
"TAYLOR: If for some reason, you should get separated from the group, you'll find a map on the third page of your welcome packet."
"DOUG: Why'd you draw your store so big?"
"TAYLOR: It just makes it easier to find if you get lost."
"DOUG: It's bigger than the school."
"MAN 1: And why'd you put all those P's in soda shop? Is that supposed to fancy or something?"
"MICHEL: You are in room twelve, and your father is "
"MAN 2: Are you from France?"
"MICHEL: Excuse me?"
"MAN 2: You talk funny. You from France."
"MICHEL: Yes. So, as I was saying "
"MAN 2: I was in France during the Big One."
"MICHEL: Oh, that's nice. So -"
"MAN 2: Nice? It was a w*r. What's nice about that?"
"MICHEL: Of course. So, your father is "
"MAN 2: Don't give me that attitude, Frenchy. You'd be speaking German now if it wasn't for me."
"LORELAI: Just make sure to have the vans back at 3:45 to take them to the game."
"TAYLOR: Oh, Lorelai, just a second. I wanted to "
"DOUG: Hold on there, what is this?"
"TAYLOR: That's the itinerary I've worked out for the afternoon. I thought Lorelai could post it in case some of the inn's other guests wanted to join us in our pre-game activities. Oh, Lorelai, this is my older brother Doug. Doug, this is Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hello."
"DOUG: Nice to meet you. Taylor, I told you on the phone, no one is gonna wanna do any of this crap. A tour of Stars Hollow? Most of us were born here. What do we need a tour for? Everyone, listen up. We're meeting down here in two hours for the vans to the game. You're late, you're walking. Go back to your store and count peaches or something. I'm taking a nap."
"[Lorelai walks toward the front desk]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, hello."
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"EMILY: You remember, I'm so touched."
"LORELAI: What are you doing here?"
"EMILY: Well, I was thinking about possibly having our next DAR luncheon here."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"EMILY: That's right. So I thought I would stop by and make sure the place is as charming as I remember. It is."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, what day would you like to have the meeting?"
"EMILY: The fifteenth."
"LORELAI: The fifteenth. Um, well, the fifteenth looks wide open, so you're officially down for the fifteenth."
"EMILY: Wonderful."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: Okay."
"LORELAI: So."
"EMILY: So, how is Michel?"
"LORELAI: Michel's fine."
"EMILY: Well, good. I'm glad to hear it."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm glad to tell it. But Mom, I have this really big family reunion party that invaded the place today, so I should probably get back to work."
"EMILY: Oh, yes, you go right ahead. Do not let me keep you."
"LORELAI: Okay. Mom?"
"EMILY: I'm not allowed to go home."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: She's banished me from my own house"
"LORELAI: Gran?"
"EMILY: She's gone mad. This morning she announces that she's hosting a meeting of her bitter old biddies club at our house tonight and she needs the entire day to prepare because the house is in such a shambles."
"LORELAI: Nice, subtle."
"EMILY: Then I was handed a list of chores and asked not to come home until at least six o'clock because I would simply be in the way."
"LORELAI: Mom, she's only staying with you for a few days."
"EMILY: I have to buy her flowers. She doesn't like mine, they're too tall. It's ostentatious to have flowers that tall."
"LORELAI: Actually, I've been meaning to mention that to you myself."
"EMILY: I have to get new guest towels. I have to get new highball glasses. I have to get four very specific types of cheese. And I have to get a slide projector because they're going to view slides of potential acquisitions for the museum that they're on the board of."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom "
"EMILY: Of course, I haven't the faintest idea of where to find a slide projector. I feel like I'm going insane."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: I'm sorry. I think I'm just a little sensitive right now. It's selfish, I know, but Richard's traveling more than he ever did. He's been gone three of the last four weeks, and now he's finally home, and she's there commanding all of his attention, all of his time. I sound like a spoiled high school girl."
"LORELAI: Not quite. You still haven't asked for the Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and the convertible Rabbit."
"EMILY: Oh, never mind. I'm sorry I kept you from your work."
"LORELAI: Mom, listen, I have a slide projector. I'd be happy to bring it over tonight."
"EMILY: Oh, I really appreciate this, Lorelai. I mean it, I couldn't be more grateful."
"LORELAI: Hold on."
"EMILY: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I wanna get a tape recorder. I want that last thing on tape."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Just remember what you said."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[The band is setting up for the prayer meeting]"
"MRS. KIM: You have everything you need  water, extension cords?"
"DAVE: Yes, ma'am, I think we're good."
"MRS. KIM: Where's your tambourine?"
"DAVE: We don't have one."
"MRS. KIM: Next time bring one."
"[doorbell rings]"
"ZACH: Dude, remember the drill instructor in Full Metal Jacket?"
"BRIAN: Totally."
"[Mrs. Kim answers the door]"
"YOUNG CHUI: Good evening."
"MRS. KIM: Ah, Young Chui, come in. Lane, look, Young Chui is here."
"LANE: Hi."
"YOUNG CHUI: Hi. These are for you. [hands her a bouquet of flowers]"
"LANE: Thank you, they're beautiful. Isn't that nice of him, Mama?"
"MRS. KIM: Yes, very thoughtful. Stand together now. Don't smile. [takes picture] Very nice. That one's for the grandchildren."
"LANE: Well, we better go. We don't wanna be late for the game."
"MRS. KIM: I will put these in a vase for you for your bedside table. Now, go have fun."
"LANE: We'll be home by nine."
"MRS. KIM: Ah, yes, whatever. Go, go."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is near the front desk as Sookie walks over with a box]"
"SOOKIE: Oh, thank goodness you haven't left."
"LORELAI: Why, what's up?"
"SOOKIE: Emily called and asked if you can bring some serving dishes. Apparently, hers are tacky."
"LORELAI: My, Gran is a relentless old broad, isn't she?"
"SOOKIE: You want them where?"
"LORELAI: Just on the counter's fine. Thanks, hon."
"[Lorelai calls home]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: What are you doing there?"
"RORY: What do you mean, what am I doing here? I live here, remember? Who were you expecting to find?"
"LORELAI: No one. I was calling to check messages and see if Mom called."
"RORY: Well, she hasn't. No one has. In fact, this is the first time the phone's rung all day."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"RORY: What, ah?"
"LORELAI: Okay, get out."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Out of the house, get out of the house."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Why? Look at the clock, what does it say?"
"RORY: It says six."
"LORELAI: So, it is six on a Saturday night, which means you have now spent a day and a night waiting for him to call."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: Well, that's not good, kid. Look, let's say he does call. You can't be the kind of girl that gets all mad in her head and then forgets everything once he deigns to show up, right?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Okay, so don't just sit there waiting. Go out, do something."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. What's Lane doing tonight?"
"RORY: She's going to the hockey game with her fake boyfriend."
"LORELAI: Perfect."
"RORY: Perfect? It's a hockey game."
"LORELAI: It'll be fun. There'll be cheerleaders and clowns, people doing the wave."
"RORY: You have no idea what a hockey game is, do you?"
"LORELAI: It doesn't matter. Put on a jacket and get outta there, and if he calls . . ."
"RORY: Who cares!"
"LORELAI: That's my girl."
"RORY: Thanks, Mom."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily walks into the house carrying several bags. From the hallway, she sees Trix in the living room kissing a man. Emily quietly walks back outside.]"
"EMILY: Oh my."
""
""
""
"CUT TO HOCKEY RINK"
"[The game is about to start. Miss Patty and Babette stand in the center of the rink singing the National Anthem.]"
"BABETTE/MISS PATTY: [singing] . . .And the rockets red glare, the b*mb bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."
"[Rory walks over to Lane in the stands]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LANE: Rory."
"RORY: It's cold in here."
"LANE: It's the ice."
"RORY: Oh my God, there really is ice. Cool."
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"RORY: I'm hockeying."
"LANE: That's not a word."
"RORY: Where is everybody?"
"LANE: There was a monster truck show in Woodbury tonight, pulls a lot of the same demographic. Sit. Where's Jess?"
"RORY: Don't know, don't care."
"LANE: Really?"
"RORY: I'm a free woman tonight."
"LANE: Is everything okay?"
"RORY: Everything's fine."
"LANE: You sure?"
"RORY: Absolutely. I just wanted to see some good hockey playing."
"LANE: Uh huh."
"RORY: Really. Is that Young Chui?"
"LANE: You mean the guy with the cell phone stapled to his ear  yeah, that's him."
"RORY: He looks kind of serious."
"LANE: He's talking to Karen."
"RORY: His real girlfriend?"
"LANE: I think she's not quite as cool as Dave is about the whole fake dating thing. She needs reassurance."
"RORY: Well, Dave is pretty cool."
"LANE: The coolest, isn't it? I mean, besides Jess."
"RORY: Right."
"LANE: Right."
"KIRK: People of Stars Hollow, are you ready to rumble? Then let's get it on."
"[the referee drops the puck to start the game]"
"KIRK: And the puck is down as the first quarter begins. Period, sorry. First period begins, my bad."
"RORY: So, this is sports."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[The band is playing at the prayer meeting]"
"ZACH: [singing] I once was lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I see."
"WHOLE BAND: [singing] Amen."
"MRS. KIM: Very nice. You may now take a fifteen-minute break while we finish our tea. Also, good time to retune."
"BRIAN: Was she looking at me?"
"ZACH: She wasn't looking at me, dude."
"DAVE: Hey, I'm gonna, uh, go outside and get some air, okay?"
"ZACH: Uh, sure."
"DAVE: Okay, be right back."
"[Dave walks out onto the porch, checks his watch, then starts running down the street]"
"CUT TO HOCKEY GAME"
"[Rory and Lane are in line at the snack stand.]"
"LANE: [on cell phone] Believe me, I am not interested in Young Chui in that way. He's cute and all, but I've got a guy. No, no, when I say he's cute, I just mean he's your boyfriend and you've got good taste, that's all. Hey, Koreans do not have problems! [hands phone to Young Chui] You talk to her, I'm done."
"YOUNG CHUI: [on phone] Karen? [walks away]"
"RORY: That went well."
"LINDSAY: Oh."
"RORY: Hey Lindsay, how are you?"
"LANE: Hi Lindsay."
"LINDSAY: Hi. I'm good, thanks. Um, how are you?"
"RORY: Good. You know, just enjoying my first hockey game. It seems there's a lot of bashing of people into walls, which is always good fun in my book."
"LINDSAY: Oh, absolutely. I'm all for more bashing."
"RORY: You know, I don't think we've seen each other since I left Stars Hollow High. What have you been up to?"
"LINDSAY: Oh, you know, nothing really. The usual, school."
"RORY: Right, sure."
"LANE: School. Me too, but you know that since we go to school together."
"LINDSAY: Well, I should be getting back. Um, it was good seeing you again."
"RORY: You, too."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Lindsay walks away]"
"RORY: Okay, so that was weird, right?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah, really weird."
"RORY: But I didn't do anything, did I?"
"LANE: You mean like ask her how she was? Yeah, you probably made an enemy for life."
"RORY: Maybe she's angry because I didn't keep in touch after I left, but we weren't that good of friends."
"LANE: Maybe, or it could be that Chilton thing."
"RORY: What Chilton thing?"
"LANE: Well, you know how some people think because you went to Chilton, you're a snob and think you're better than everyone else."
"RORY: What? Who thinks that?"
"LANE: Well, you know, like uh, Julie Lersten, Kristin Keiffer, Jill Allen. Haven't we talked about this?"
"RORY: No."
"[Dave walks up behind them]"
"DAVE: Hey."
"LANE: Dave."
"DAVE: Hey Rory."
"RORY: Hey."
"DAVE: So, where's, uh, where's Young Chui?"
"LANE: Talking to Karen."
"DAVE: Who?"
"RORY: His girlfriend."
"DAVE: Oh, right. That's cool, okay. Well, how's the game?"
"LANE: The other team's winning."
"RORY: But our fans have the best insults. At least, Babette does."
"DAVE: Well, that's really what counts in the end."
"LANE: So, what are you doing here? Did you finish already?"
"DAVE: Oh, no. You're mom gave us a fifteen minute break. I just thought I'd swing by."
"LANE: But it's more than a mile away."
"DAVE: Yeah, I better get back. I'll see you later."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Dave leaves]"
"RORY: Well, well, well. If I didn't know better, I'd say someone isn't quite as cool as we thought he was."
"LANE: What do you mean? He's jealous. Oh my God, he's jealous, that's so great."
"RORY: You've worked your womanly wiles on him, Lane Kim."
"LANE: I've never made a guy jealous before. I feel so powerful."
"RORY: Just remember, there's cute jealous and there's Othello."
"LANE: Good point."
"RORY: So, who else thinks I'm a snob?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the front entryway as there's a knock at the door. She opens it.]"
"LORELAI: Jess."
"JESS: Hey, is Rory here?"
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"JESS: Yeah, I'm serious."
"LORELAI: No, I'm serious. Are you serious?"
"JESS: Why do you keep asking me if I'm serious?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm just trying to imagine the scenario here. You looked at the clock that said it was 7:30 on a Saturday night and you thought to yourself, ""Hey, Rory must be home."""
"JESS: Yes."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, are you serious?"
"JESS: Okay, I'm guessing that's your way of telling me she's not home."
"LORELAI: No, Jess, she's not home."
"JESS: Do you know where she is?"
"LORELAI: She's at the hockey game."
"JESS: Hey, look, you don't wanna tell me where she is, fine."
"LORELAI: Jess, she really is at the hockey game. You'd know that if you'd  what, ladies and gentlemen? That's right  bothered to call."
"JESS: Why are you hassling me?"
"LORELAI: Well, mostly because I'm here to hassle you. Now, if you'd bothered calling, maybe Rory would be here to hassle you."
"JESS: Hey, Rory knows I'm not the kind of guy who lives by a schedule."
"LORELAI: Yes, and look what the guy who doesn't live by a schedule ends up doing on a Saturday night  talking to his girlfriend's mother."
"JESS: Whatever."
"LORELAI: Hey, Jess. You like music, right? The Beach Boys said it best. None of the guys go steady cause it wouldn't be right to leave their best girls home on a Saturday night. Rory is one of the best girls. She's the best girl, if you want my opinion, and you don't seem to have the first idea as to how she should be treated."
"JESS: Well, luckily I've got you to tell me."
"LORELAI: Not anymore. You and I have discussed your relationship with Rory long enough."
"JESS: Fine."
"LORELAI: I'll tell her you stopped by."
"JESS: Don't bother. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Brian Hutchins is looking pretty good right about now."
"CUT TO HOCKEY GAME"
"[Rory and Lane are carrying their food back to their seats]"
"RORY: If I had known sports were so much about eating, I would've come to a lot more of these."
"LANE: I know. There's something deeply satisfying about watching other people exercise while eating junk food."
"KIRK: Ten minutes til the next period, ladies and gentlemen. That's what we call them in hockey  periods, not halves. Let's try to keep that straight. Also, the puck is never referred to as a ball, not according to the book. Again, my bad."
"[Rory and Lane see Dean and Lindsay kissing]"
"LANE: I guess it wasn't the Chilton thing after all."
"CUT TO LATER IN THE HOCKEY GAME"
"KIRK: Number twelve has it now. He's skating, he's skating. My bet is he's going to try to whack it into that net thingy, but that's conjecture at this point. Now it's going the other way and they're hitting it between them. Number seven has it. Now number three. Now seven. Three again. Seven. Ten's got it now."
"[Dean skates over to Kirk]"
"DEAN: Kirk, just to let you know, some of the guys  not me, you know  but some of the guys say they're gonna rip your head off if you don't shut up, okay?"
"KIRK: We'll be pausing for a short break."
"CROWD: [cheers] We've got spirit, yes we do! We've got spirit, how about you?"
"LANE: You sure you're okay?"
"RORY: Will you stop asking me that every five seconds? I'm fine. I mean, it had to happen sometime. I didn't expect him to just sit around pining for me. Okay, a little, but she's really nice, right?"
"LANE: This is all my fault."
"RORY: Lane."
"LANE: I let you down. I'm supposed to be your eyes and ears in that school, and here's the biggest piece of news all year and I had no idea."
"RORY: It's okay."
"LANE: No, it's not. This is an intelligence gaffe of monumental proportions. What was I doing that I didn't notice this?"
"RORY: Studying, taking classes."
"LANE: Well, no more."
"RORY: Lane, it's not a big deal, really. And now I know, so, case closed."
"LANE: You're sure?"
"RORY: Positive. Let's just enjoy the game."
"PLAYER: No way!"
"KIRK: Excuse me, will you tell me what happened? Excuse me, number fourteen? Number fourteen, could you come back here?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings. The maid opens the door. Lorelai is standing there with the slide projector and the box of serving dishes]"
"LORELAI: Hi. Just came to drop off some things."
"MAID: Oh, I can take those."
"LORELAI: Oh, great, thanks. [hands them to her] Careful, it's heavy."
"MAID: Everyone's in the living room if you wanna go in."
"LORELAI: Uh, if I wanna go in, if I wanna go in. Well, you pose a very deep and philosophical question there, but I think I'll just "
"[Emily walks over]"
"EMILY: Lorelai. I thought I heard your voice."
"LORELAI: Yes, I brought the slide machine and the platters and the punch bowl."
"EMILY: Wonderful. Come in and meet everyone, won't you?"
"LORELAI: I was just gonna do that."
"[cut to the living room. Trix and her friends are looking at slides]"
"MRS. VAN WYCK: It's obscene."
"TRIX: It's Picasso."
"MRS. VAN WYCK: Then Picasso is obscene."
"TRIX: Oh, Isabelle."
"MRS. VAN WYCK: It has six breasts."
"TRIX: You cannot be sure if those are breasts. They could be canons. He was quite obsessed with the Spanish Civil w*r for awhile."
"EMILY: Ladies, look who's here."
"TRIX: Lorelai, wonderful. We all need a break for a moment. Come meet my friends. Emily, we were waiting for iced tea or am I imagining things?"
"EMILY: It's on its way, Mom."
"TRIX: So is death. Lorelai, this is Mrs. Van Wyck, Mrs. Deerborne, Mrs. Rutherman. This is my granddaughter, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Nice to meet you all."
"TRIX: Well, come, sit."
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't want to interrupt anything."
"TRIX: You're interrupting nothing but thirst, my dear. Now, talk to some old women, tell us what it's like to be young."
"LORELAI: Not nearly as much fun since the mandatory sunscreen rule, I'll tell ya."
"[the maid brings in a platter]"
"EMILY: Here we go, iced tea and sandwiches."
"TRIX: [picks up a glass] Too warm. Do you know that Lorelai's daughter is graduating from Chilton in June?"
"[Emily walks over to the drink cart to put ice in the glass]"
"EMILY: [sings] Love in the afternoon. . ."
"TRIX: She is an excellent student and may. . ."
"EMILY: La, la, la, la, la. . ."
"TRIX: Emily, what are you doing?"
"EMILY: I'm sorry?"
"TRIX: Why are you singing like that?"
"EMILY: Was I signing? I didn't realize. Here's your tea, Mom. I certainly hope it's cold enough."
"LORELAI: Um, I brought the slide projector over. Would you like me to set it up?"
"TRIX: That would be fine. We can start watching now since I do not anticipate dinner being served anywhere near the time I requested."
"EMILY: [sings] Our hearts are filled with joy. . ."
"TRIX: Emily you're doing it again."
"EMILY: I was?"
"TRIX: Yes, you were."
"EMILY: Huh. You know, it's because I caught some of ""Love in the Afternoon"" the other day, the movie. Have you seen it, Mom?"
"TRIX: I don't believe I have."
"EMILY: Oh, well, it's wonderful. And a wonderful concept, too, don't you think? Anyway, I must have the music stuck in my head. That must be why I'm singing it. I mean, what else could it be, hm?"
"LORELAI: Hey, Mom, how bout we go get some of that cheese you bought for the ladies, huh? I'll help you. Come on. We'll be right back."
"[Lorelai and Emily walk into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Okay, what is going on?"
"EMILY: I saw her kissing a man."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: When I came home today, I walked in and I saw her standing in the living room kissing a man."
"LORELAI: Gran?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: My Gran?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: My Gran was kissing a man?"
"EMILY: In a purple velour jogging suit."
"LORELAI: Gran was in a purple velour jogging suit?"
"EMILY: No, the man was wearing a purple jogging suit."
"LORELAI: And you're sure they were kissing?"
"EMILY: One hundred percent sure."
"LORELAI: My God. Was he hot?"
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know what you're supposed to ask when you hear your grandmother's been making out with a guy."
"EMILY: I don't know if he was hot. Your grandmother sucking face was blocking my view."
"LORELAI: What'd she do? Did she see you?"
"EMILY: No. After my heart started back up again, I went outside and hid in the bushes until he left."
"LORELAI: Okay, now I have two really good visuals fighting for top billing here."
"EMILY: Do you realize how wonderful this is?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I guess it's wonderful, Gran has a guy."
"EMILY: No, what's wonderful is after all these years of her abuse, her condescension, her insults and her degrading comments, after all these years of pure unadulterated hell, I finally have something to hold over her."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom."
"EMILY: Finally, I have the upper hand. Finally, I have something to nail her with. Finally, that woman is going down."
"LORELAI: You cannot use this against Gran."
"EMILY: Yes, I can, I've earned it."
"LORELAI: Mom, I know Gran gives you a hard time, but she did not tell anyone about this guy for a reason."
"EMILY: Yes, because she's embarrassed. She should be. He was dressed like a bookie."
"LORELAI: You have to be above this."
"EMILY: No, I don't have to be above this."
"LORELAI: You're seriously telling me that you're gonna be the one to go out there and humiliate Gran in front of her friends, in front of her family. Just think about it, Mom. What would Miss Manners do?"
"EMILY: It's not fair."
"LORELAI: Gran will be back in her own house soon."
"EMILY: I know, you're right."
"LORELAI: Just hang on til then."
"EMILY: All right, let's go back in there and get this evening over with."
"LORELAI: You're a stand up lady, Emily Gilmore, you know that?"
"EMILY: Oh really? Well, that makes me feel so much better."
"[they walk back to the living room]"
"MRS. VAN WYCK: And is this normal, Richard, to be getting home from work so late?"
"RICHARD: Oh, that's one of the pitfalls of starting your own business, I'm afraid."
"TRIX: You should say, of starting a successful business, Richard."
"RICHARD: Successful so far, Trix. Let's not jinx it."
"TRIX: Though, perhaps if Emily could have the meal served on time, Richard would have more inducement to get home at a reasonable hour."
"EMILY: I saw her kissing a man in a track suit!"
"RICHARD: What?"
"TRIX: Emily!"
"CUT TO HOCKEY GAME"
"[The game is over. People are filing out of the stands]"
"KIRK: Well, ladies and gentlemen, much like the Israelites of Yore, the Stars Hollow Minutemen languished in the desert for forty years. But tonight, there was no Promised Land, no New Canaan, only a humiliating five to one defeat at the merciless hands of the West Hartford Wildcats. So it's back to the desert for the Minutemen, perhaps for another forty years. Of course, by then, I'll be seventy years old. A lot of the rest of you will probably be dead. Taylor, you'll be dead. Babette, Miss Patty. . .that man there in the hat."
"LANE: Hey, if we run, we might be able to catch the last few minutes of the band."
"RORY: Yeah, I don't think the pint of liquid cheese in my stomach is going to allow for much running."
"LANE: I'll call you tomorrow."
"RORY: Definitely. Have fun."
"YOUNG CHUI: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Dean. Hey, how are you? Oh, God, that's a stupid question to ask someone who just lost the regional semi-finals, isn't it? And now it sounds like I'm rubbing your face in it."
"DEAN: Don't worry about it. They were better than us, they deserved to win."
"RORY: And hey, at least you got a point. That's good, right? I mean, better than not getting any. Geez, I really suck at this post-sports talk."
"DEAN: Well, you haven't had much practice."
"RORY: True. But who knows, I might be a sports convert. I mean, the eating of massive amounts of junk food, and listening to Kirk make a fool of himself in front of a bunch of people  all things I enjoy."
"DEAN: In fact, you could almost get rid of the sports part of it."
"RORY: That's what I was going to say. So, I ran into Lindsay."
"DEAN: Yeah, I hadn't quite figured out how to tell you that."
"RORY: Well, I think it's great."
"DEAN: You do?"
"RORY: Absolutely. I mean, she's cute and smart and really nice."
"DEAN: I know."
"RORY: Like once, in fourth grade, we went on a field trip to Mark Twain's house, and I really wanted this refrigerator magnet in the shape of Mark Twain's head, but I didn't have any money, so she bought it for me, and she wouldn't even let me pay her back. Pretty classy for a fourth grader."
"DEAN: That sounds like Lindsay."
"RORY: Exactly. So, good job, mister."
"DEAN: Thanks. So, how are things with Jess?"
"RORY: Oh, good, good."
"DEAN: He's not with you?"
"RORY: No. This really isn't his kind of thing."
"DEAN: Yeah. Well, uh, I'd better go. I gotta change and then Lindsay and I are going out."
"RORY: Right. Sure. Have fun."
"[Dean leaves. Rory walks to a pay phone and calls Jess]"
"LUKE: [on answering machine] You've reached Luke Danes and Jess Mariano, leave a message."
"RORY: It's me. I just wanted to let you know that this is the last weekend I spend sitting around like an idiot hoping you'll call, okay? I'm not going to be that girl. From now on, I want a plan. I mean, a real plan with a time and a place, and I'm tired of hearing Let's hook up later.' What does that mean anyway? What's later? How do I set my watch to later? Later doesn't cut it anymore, got it? And, yeah, you know, maybe I am spoiled. But guess what? I like being spoiled. I plan to go on being spoiled. And if that doesn't sound like something that you can or want to do, then fine. I'm sure you'll find another girl who doesn't mind sitting around cleaning her keyboard on a Friday night hoping you'll call, but it's not going to be me. Oh, yeah, this is a message for Jess."
"[Rory walks outside and sees Jess leaning against his car]"
"JESS: Hey. Figured I'd find you here. I mean, you say the word hockey, you say the word Rory, right?"
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"JESS: Came to give you these."
"RORY: Earplugs. What are these for?"
"JESS: I got tickets to the Distillers."
"RORY: You did? For when?"
"JESS: For tonight."
"RORY: Tonight? But "
"JESS: I would've been here sooner, but I had to wait in line. So we should probably get going. I mean, we don't wanna miss anything, right?"
"RORY: Hey, Jess?"
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: When you get home, could you erase your answering machine without listening to any of the messages? That'd be great, thanks."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Trix is lying in bed. There's a knock at the door]"
"GRAN: Come in."
"[Emily walks in]"
"EMILY: I brought you some aspirin. It's the buffered kind that you like. Is there anything else that you need?"
"GRAN: No, thank you."
"EMILY: Mom, I want to apologize for what I said downstairs. I had no right to humiliate you like that, in front of your friends, in front of Richard. This relationship was something you had chosen to keep private and I should have respected that. I am truly sorry. He seemed like a very nice man. Why didn't you tell anyone about him?"
"GRAN: I married once, I married Richard's father. That was my husband. I have no desire to marry again and dishonor his memory."
"EMILY: I understand."
"GRAN: I believe a woman marries for life. If, after your husband is gone, you desperately desire some sort of permanent attachment, add an addition onto the house  a library or a solarium. I have a library and a solarium."
"EMILY: Yes, you do."
"GRAN: However, in spite of all this, I found myself getting lonely. And I don't care for being lonely, it's quite annoying. So many years ago, I met a man, and he became my companion. Tonight, both he and I were both publicly humiliated and our relationship altered forever. Can you imagine how that feels?"
"EMILY: Actually, I've had a little experience with being humiliated in front of the people I love, yes. Mom, please believe me, I know how important your pride is to you, and I never had any intention of robbing you of it. I feel terrible that I caused you any pain. I just wish that once in awhile, you might feel a little bit terrible that you cause me pain. I have pride, too, you know. And my husband travels and is very busy and I miss him and I'm lonely sometimes, just like you."
"GRAN: Well."
"CUT TO DOWNSTAIRS"
"[Lorelai and Richard are in the living room]"
"LORELAI: So that was quite a gathering."
"RICHARD: Yes, it was."
"LORELAI: It would make a great Christmas story. I mean, I know it didn't happen at Christmas, but it's the kind of thing that would happen at Christmas, so it's not like if you told someone it did happen at Christmas, they'd go, Really? Cause it doesn't sound like a Christmas story.' Thanksgiving would probably work also. Listen, Dad, I know you're a little upset with Mom right now, and I'm probably out of line in saying this, but you might wanna think about cutting her some slack. She's really missed you lately. I mean, you work so much and then you're helping Gran in your free time, which is totally understandable, but still, it's hard. As much as Gran likes you, she tends to be a littler rough on Mom, and I think Mom just kind of snapped. She'd never do anything like that intentionally. You do know that, Dad, right?"
"[Richard starts laughing]"
"LORELAI: Dad? Okay, apparently it's two-for-one flip out night at the Gilmore house."
"RICHARD: Do you really think he was wearing a track suit?"
"LORELAI: I don't. . ."
"RICHARD: Well, I wonder if he was wearing Nike's also."
"LORELAI: Just Do It takes on a whole new meaning, doesn't it?"
"RICHARD: I guess I've got a new daddy."
"LORELAI: Maybe he'll take you to ball games."
"RICHARD: Oh, we could get matching jogging suits. Oh, if only I could've seen Emily hiding in the bushes. It's like a play by Moliere."
"[Emily walks down the steps]"
"EMILY: What are you two cackling about?"
"RICHARD: Oh, nothing."
"LORELAI: Yeah, nothing."
"EMILY: Well, don't stop on my account. I'm just passing through."
"RICHARD: Where are you going?"
"EMILY: We're going to have tea."
"LORELAI: They're going to have tea?"
"RICHARD: That's a first."
"LORELAI: Maybe they're going to be pals now."
"RICHARD: I don't know how I feel about my mother and my wife being in cahoots."
"LORELAI: I don't know how I feel about you saying the word cahoots."
"RICHARD: Well, this alliance could make things very uncomfortable for me."
"[Emily walks past them with a tray of tea]"
"EMILY: Sending a maid down to tell me how to make tea, as if I don't know after all these years. Guess she'll have a coronary if the water hits the cup one second before the bag."
"LORELAI: I think you're safe."
"RICHARD: I think so, too."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is eating at the kitchen table when Rory comes home]"
"LORELAI: Hey, how was the game?"
"RORY: Fun, we got clobbered."
"LORELAI: Oh. If you'd won, you could've rioted through town trashing storefronts and torching police cars like they do in L.A."
"RORY: Maybe next year."
"LORELAI: What'd you do after?"
"RORY: Oh, you know, just hung out."
"LORELAI: With Lane and her fake boyfriend?"
"RORY: Uh huh. I thought you were eating at Grandma's."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, and there's a story behind that."
"RORY: Can it wait til tomorrow? I'm really exhausted."
"LORELAI: It's a good story."
"RORY: I'm sure. I just won't be able to fully appreciate it in my weakened state. And this gives you extra time to practice your voices."
"LORELAI: Fine, fine. Let me just say two words  jogging suit."
"RORY: Jogging suit."
"LORELAI: See, you're hooked."
"RORY: Yeah, well, now I'm definitely waking up tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Night honey."
"RORY: Night Mom."
"[Rory walks into her bedroom and lies down on her bed]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are both reading in the living room. Lorelai glances out the window]"
"LORELAI: Mail!"
"RORY: Mail!"
"LORELAI: Hurry up! Where are your shoes?"
"RORY: I'll get them later."
"LORELAI: No, get them now."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Why? Because if your Harvard acceptance letter is in that batch of mail and you do not have shoes on, we can't run off immediately and celebrate. All of our happiness will be on hold until you come back inside and put on your shoes. Is that what you want to put a hold on happiness?"
"RORY: What's the difference if we wait then or we wait now?"
"LORELAI: Because we are not happy now."
"RORY: Right, okay. [runs to her bedroom]"
"LORELAI: No laces, just get them on your feet."
"RORY: [runs back with shoes on] Let's go!"
"[they run outside to the mailbox. Kirk is going through his mailbag]"
"LORELAI: Kirk!"
"RORY: Kirk!"
"KIRK: Good morning, ladies."
"LORELAI: Is there an envelope in there?"
"RORY: A big envelope, not a little envelope."
"LORELAI: Yeah, a big envelope means she's in, a little envelope means she needs to marry rich."
"KIRK: Just one second, please."
"RORY: Aren't you supposed to go through the mail before you get here?"
"KIRK: Some work that way. Personally, I think it takes the spontaneity out of the job."
"LORELAI: Need some help?"
"KIRK: Sorry, federal law prohibits it."
"RORY: Any chance you could go faster?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, you got a girl's future in that sack of yours, Santa."
"RORY: Thank you for adding the Santa."
"LORELAI: Any time."
"KIRK: You know what I've noticed?"
"LORELAI: It wouldn't be any mail in there with our names on it, would it?"
"KIRK: I've noticed people don't slow down anymore."
"RORY: Guess I've got time to tie my shoes."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, cobble yourself a new pair Daniel Day Lewis."
"KIRK: No one stops to smell a nice flower or look at a puppy."
"LORELAI: You're absolutely right."
"[Kirk pulls a large envelope out of his mailbag]"
"KIRK: No one stops to ask how you're doing. . .is your family well, did you see that game last night?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, people suck. Is that ours?"
"KIRK: What? Oh. [checks envelope] Mrs. Rita Flora. Nope."
"RORY: Rats."
"LORELAI: It could still be in there."
"KIRK: Rita Flora  didn't she die?"
"LORELAI: While you were delivering her mail?"
"KIRK: She did die. She died last week."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: They're supposed to put your mail on hold when you die."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's go back inside."
"RORY: What about the envelope?"
"LORELAI: We'll check back on our way to Luke's. . .for dinner."
"KIRK: [pulls out another envelope] Hey, one for Kirk."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Lane are sitting at a table. Lane is tapping her drumsticks on a jar]"
"LANE: It's getting frustrating. I mean, there's so many great songs that have been written post-Cobain, but try and convince Zach of that. I mean, he's impossible, stubborn, and just a tad intellectually challenged, in case you haven't noticed."
"LORELAI: Lane, honey?"
"LANE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Just, could you, with the sticks there, I can't. . ."
"LANE: Oh, sorry. Nervous habit."
"RORY: Mom's a little crabby this morning."
"LORELAI: I'm not crabby, I'm very, very ill."
"RORY: With allergies."
"LORELAI: Deadly allergies."
"RORY: Sorry, didn't mean to minimize your condition. Should we make funeral arrangements now?"
"LORELAI: Yes. [pulls some medicine out of her purse] But make sure you can get your money back in case this stuff works."
"RORY: Where did you get those?"
"LORELAI: Found them in your room."
"RORY: These expired in 98."
"LORELAI: So, what, I should take four?"
"RORY: Yes, that's exactly my point."
"[Luke walks over and sets some menus on the table]"
"LUKE: Here."
"RORY: New menus."
"LANE: Very fancy."
"LORELAI: Why'd you get new menus?"
"LUKE: It was time."
"LORELAI: But I had made little doodles with my name hidden in them on each one of the old ones just like Hirschfeld."
"LUKE: Sorry."
"LORELAI: It took me years to hit every menu. And these have super heavy plastic over them. How am I gonna doodle?"
"LUKE: Has it ever occurred to you that the super heavy plastic is there to discourage the doodling?"
"RORY: Hey, this looks different."
"LUKE: It's not different."
"LANE: It's totally different."
"LUKE: It's not that different."
"LORELAI: There are more salads."
"RORY: Three more salads."
"LORELAI: Three more salads  who needs three more salads?"
"RORY: One was enough."
"LUKE: Well, Nicole said "
"LORELAI: Nicole said."
"LUKE: There wasn't really that much for her to eat on the menu, so I just. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, you added three more salads just for Nicole. When I asked you to add chili-topped Pringles, you said no."
"LUKE: And I stand by that."
"LORELAI: How come Nicole gets three salads and I still get a no?"
"RORY: Because Nicole is his girlfriend."
"LUKE: Nicole is not my girlfriend, Nicole is the woman that I am dating, that's it."
"LORELAI: So what happens when you guys get serious, the whole place goes soy?"
"LUKE: Just order, please."
"LANE: Did you take off the Monte Cristo sandwich?"
"LUKE: Well, I "
"RORY: No!"
"LORELAI: You did, you took off the Monte Cristo sandwich."
"LUKE: I omitted a few obsolete dishes."
"LORELAI: I can't believe Nicole made you take off the Monte Cristo. She's got you menu-whipped."
"LUKE: She does not have me menu-whipped. I took off a disgusting ridiculous sandwich that no one has ever ordered, including the three of you."
"RORY: But just having it there made us feel like we always could."
"LORELAI: It was comforting."
"RORY: Like soup."
"LORELAI: Exactly. It was comforting like deep-fried ham and cheese soup."
"RORY: And even though I never ordered it, I talked about ordering it, haven't I?"
"LANE: On several occasions."
"LORELAI: So you've not only eliminated a sandwich, you've eliminated a conversation piece."
"RORY: Now what will we talk about?"
"LUKE: Fine."
"[Luke walks to the counter and returns with some old menus]"
"LUKE: Here. Old menus, everything's there. Knock yourselves out."
"LORELAI: How come everybody else gets a new menu? [Luke walks away] I feel much better now."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"[A teacher is passing back papers]"
"TEACHER: Well, I must say I'm glad to see that simply because the SATs are over, most of you are still taking your classwork seriously. Most of you."
"LOUISE: Michael Mason. Worth every wrong answer."
"TEACHER: All right, before we continue, I would like to remind you that the Chilton Bicentennial celebration takes place next week."
"LOUISE: Number four. [shows off her hickey]"
"MADELINE: Well done."
"TEACHER: The official sign up sheet for the speech contest has gone up in the back of the room. The contest will be held on Friday, and the winner will present their speech at the ceremony next week. Now, some of you may be saying to yourself, Hey, I already turned in my college application. Why should I spend all this time entering a speech competition, which if I win means I have to give up a Friday night, when I can't even use it for my resume? What's in it for me?'"
"MADELINE: Wow, that was spooky."
"TEACHER: Yes, the speech will not go on your record. However, the bicentennial is going to be quite a prestigious affair. Past alumni and faculty will be there, some of these people are now professors at the same schools you're planning an attending. Plus, C-SPAN will be broadcasting the event live. All in all, it's shaping up to be a very exciting event. Think about it. [bell rings] Oh, I almost forgot to welcome back Brad Langford. He returns to us fresh from Broadway where he's just completed a successful run of Into the Woods. Welcome back, Brad."
"BRAD: Thank you. It's good to be back."
"PARIS: Sit down, Mary Martin."
"TEACHER: All right everyone, have a lovely rest of the day. I will see you tomorrow."
"[the students start to leave. Brad walks up to Rory]"
"BRAD: Rory, hi."
"RORY: Hey Brad, good to have you back. How was Broadway?"
"BRAD: It was great, but Nathan Lane is a very bitter man."
"RORY: I've heard that."
"BRAD: You know, I tell you, even more than the actual experience of performing live, the confidence it gives you in every aspect of your life, that's the most amazing thing."
"RORY: Well, you do look rather confident."
"BRAD: Hey, it's the new me."
"[Madeline and Louise walk over]"
"LOUISE: So, Brad. . .Broadway, I must know."
"BRAD: Yes?"
"LOUISE: Did you get to keep your makeup?"
"MADELINE: What about your costumes, cause that seems great."
"LOUISE: Ooh, unless you're doing Les Mis."
"MADELINE: Or Cats."
"LOUISE: Furry spandex with a tail and jazz shoes?"
"MADELINE: Hurrah. So, do you?"
"BRAD: Do I?"
"MADELINE: Get to keep the makeup?"
"BRAD: I didn't ask."
"LOUISE: You didn't ask?"
"MADELINE: How do you leave the house every morning and not have a piano fall on your head?"
"BRAD: Well, I make a left on Federal and then "
"RORY: Brad, that really didn't require an answer."
"[Paris walks over]"
"PARIS: You're blocking the list."
"RORY: What's that? Will we please move so you may sign up for the speech contest? Why, yes, Paris, we'd be happy to. How kind of you to phrase it in that very respectful manner."
"PARIS: Are you going to move, or do you need a five, six, seven, eight?"
"BRAD: Paris, this time on stage has been a very growing experience for me. I'm no longer intimidated by you or people like you."
"PARIS: I'm thrilled to hear it, Chita Rivera. Move. Well, Gilmore, I certainly hope you're signing up, too. It'll be my last chance to trounce you with anything at this school."
"RORY: My decision to do this will in no way depend on you, Paris."
"PARIS: I'm only saying it won't be a totally satisfying victory just b*at Jerome Robbins and the rest of the losers here. I'd really like to take you down also."
"BRAD: Boy, she is really up on her theater references."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie, surrounded by her kitchen staff, has several plates of food on the counter in front of her]"
"SOOKIE: This is outrageous. I am beyond offended. Did you tell them I'm beyond offended? Sending my food back? That's it, get their names, they're never eating here again."
"WAITER: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Wait, what wine was he drinking?"
"WAITER: 1952 Chateau Petrus Bordeaux."
"SOOKIE: Hm. Okay, never mind."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, is everything okay?"
"SOOKIE: No, we have got to have a better screening system for customers here."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do, since we currently have no screening system for customers here."
"SOOKIE: They sent it back. My food. My four star, you haven't lived til you've eaten there, says Ruth Reichl,' food."
"LORELAI: What did they say was wrong?"
"SOOKIE: You name it. Too salty, too hot, too sewer-y."
"LORELAI: Honey, calm down. Some people are just stupid."
"SOOKIE: Yes, they are stupid, and stupid people have stupid friends, and they all have to come here and be stupid together."
"LORELAI: Okay, now, don't be mad at me, but I have to ask this  are you sure there's nothing wrong with the food?"
"SOOKIE: Of course there's nothing wrong with the food. You don't think that I would know if something was wrong with my food? You don't think that I tasted every last dish that was sent back. I tasted it, Manuel tasted it, Rico tasted it, Louella tasted it. We all tasted it and it tastes fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. Do you mind?"
"SOOKIE: You don't believe me?"
"LORELAI: I believe you completely, but it's easier for me to take on those who doubt you if I actually tasted it myself."
"SOOKIE: Fine, go ahead."
"[Lorelai tries the food]"
"LORELAI: Okay, now I get the sewer-y reference."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: Come here. [to waiter] Just, uh, send them out some free desserts."
"SOOKIE: Free desserts? You're giving the stupid people free desserts."
"LORELAI: Sookie, I love you."
"SOOKIE: I love you, too."
"LORELAI: Okay, and I love your food, you know that."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: But I have to tell you that that bite I just had over there is one of the worst things I've ever tasted, and I've tasted some very bad things."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Are you sure you didn't just accidentally drop something in the food tonight, like, I don't know, uh, strychnine or manure?"
"SOOKIE: No, I tested each dish every step of the way. I mean, the base, the stock, the sauce, the seasonings."
"LORELAI: Are you sick? Cause sometimes the flu or a cold or even allergies can throw your tastebuds off."
"SOOKIE: No, I'm not sick. I mean, I had a little bug last week, but nothing today."
"LORELAI: Well, I think you should think about getting a checkup. Maybe it was more than a little bug."
"SOOKIE: The food was really bad?"
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, it was just. . .well, yeah, it was really that bad."
"SOOKIE: I don't understand it."
"LORELAI: Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. Just have Manuel help you with the tasting for the rest of the night, okay?"
"[Rory walks into the kitchen]"
"RORY: Paris is going to drive me completely insane. Ooh, that looks good."
"ENTIRE KITCHEN STAFF: No!"
"RORY: Geez."
"LORELAI: Be happy you're loved, hon. I got a Kit Kat in my purse."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into the lobby]"
"RORY: What's up?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It's weird, Sookie must be sick or something."
"RORY: Sookie never gets sick."
"LORELAI: She'll be fine. So, tell me, what did Paris do now?"
"RORY: It's nothing, it's just Paris. There's this speech contest for the bicentennial, and I wasn't even going to enter it, but I don't know  with the whole it's my last chance to crush you before graduation' comment, I want to enter, I want to win, and I wanna dance around her saying I win, I win, I win!'"
"LORELAI: Wow, you're getting more and more like me everyday."
"RORY: But I know, it was petty and stupid and I should probably just ignore her."
"LORELAI: Yes, that is what you should do."
"RORY: Okay, that is what I will do."
"LORELAI: How come you weren't gonna enter the contest?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You love doing school things."
"RORY: I don't love doing school things when it involves the entire school staring at me while I'm doing them."
"LORELAI: You had to give your vice presidential acceptance speech in front of the entire school."
"RORY: Yeah, but I had to do that."
"LORELAI: Oh, so you're just gonna go through life only doing what you have to do."
"RORY: Well, no."
"LORELAI: Because a person who wants to be a foreign correspondent for a living should probably embrace the opportunity to practice her speechin' k*ll in front of a crowd."
"RORY: You had the motherly edge going there until you threw in the speechin' k*ll comment."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, you know what I mean."
"RORY: I know what you mean. Okay, I'll go out for the speech."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: And if I get to do the I win, I win, I win' dance, then so much the better."
"LORELAI: For everyone involved."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"LORELAI: Oh my God. Oh my God."
"[Lorelai walks across the lobby. Sookie is walking toward her]"
"LORELAI: You're pregnant!"
"SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!"
"[they scream and jump up and down]"
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, I'm pregnant!"
"RORY: You're pregnant?"
"SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!"
"LORELAI: That's why!"
"SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!"
"RORY: That's great!"
"[they all scream and hug]"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Students are outside a classroom awaiting their turns in the speech contest. Paris walks up to a girl and looks at her speech]"
"PARIS: Huh."
"GIRL: What?"
"PARIS: That just looks like more than four thousand words, but I'm sure you counted them."
"GIRL: I did."
"PARIS: Good. [to another girl] Hey Shelly, good luck. Although I'm sure you're going to be great. After all, there's hardly anything on stage for you to trip over this time, right? [sits down next to Brad; sings] I've got my beans at Grandma's house, my magic beans at Grandma's house."
"BRAD: Stop it."
"PARIS: [sings] I'll take my beans, my magic beans, who's got the beans, we need some beans, I love the beans."
"BRAD: You can't rattle me."
"PARIS: [sings] Into the woods at Grandma's house."
"BRAD: Look, I'm proud of my part, okay? The New York Times called me winningly naïve."
"PARIS: [sings] Into the woods, into the woods, into the woods."
"RORY: Stop it right now."
"PARIS: I know, that is one annoying song."
"RORY: Leave Brad alone, and stop terrorizing everyone in this hallway."
"PARIS: Terrorizing? What are you talking about, terrorizing? I'm simply talking to my fellow classmates."
"RORY: You're trying to scare them into doing badly so you'll win easier."
"PARIS: I am not."
"RORY: Oh really? And that magical bean recital back there?"
"PARIS: Hey, I was trying to give the kid some human contact. He's been talking to nothing but a cow for a year and a half."
"BRAD: There was a person inside that cow, I've told you that!"
"TEACHER: [walks out of classroom] Brad Langford."
"BRAD: I'm winningly naïve."
"TEACHER: Okay."
"PARIS: Brad, you got your beans?"
"RORY: Stop. Go Brad, you'll do great."
"[Brad walks into the classroom]"
"RORY: It's amazing how you manage to hide those bolts on the side of your neck. What is that, just really good cover up?"
"PARIS: Rory, lower your voice. People are trying to concentrate."
"RORY: Wow."
"PARIS: Wow what?"
"RORY: Your speech must really suck."
"PARIS: Excuse me?"
"RORY: I mean, if you're going to all this trouble to psych out everyone else, then you must know you have a loser there."
"PARIS: Mind games. Not your forte, cupcake. Stick to talking to losers off the train tracks, will you?"
"RORY: You're horrible."
"PARIS: And I'm going to win. [a girl sits next to her] Cherry, hi. Man those braces are shiny."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai walks out of the house toward the Jeep; her cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello"
"SOOKIE: It's me."
"LORELAI: Every detail, leave nothing out."
"SOOKIE: Well, I told him."
"LORELAI: Did he flip? Did he cry? Did he scream?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: No? Did he hear you?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, he heard me."
"LORELAI: I don't understand, what happened?"
"SOOKIE: Well, I came home and I got some flowers and I chilled some glasses and I put some music on and I opened a bottle of champagne, and the cork broke the window so I had to clean up the glass, and then I taped some cardboard over the hole, and then I knocked over the bottle of champagne, so I had to get out the mop."
"LORELAI: My finger's hitting the fast forward button, hon."
"SOOKIE: So, he came home and I handed him a beer, and I smiled and I kissed him and I told him he was gonna be a daddy."
"LORELAI: And then he did what?"
"SOOKIE: Then he got out the calculator."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: He's been crunching numbers for two hours."
"LORELAI: He didn't say anything?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: Mr. I-want-four-in-four' hears he can check off number one and he says nothing?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, not nothing."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"SOOKIE: Every fifteen minutes, he says, Oh, boy.'"
"LORELAI: Oh, boy' like Oh, boy!'?"
"SOOKIE: No, Oh, boy' like Oh, boy.'"
"JACKSON: [in background] Oh, boy."
"SOOKIE: Did you hear that?"
"LORELAI: Well, maybe he's in shock."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy."
"SOOKIE: Maybe."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: Honey, I'd go in there and take that calculator away from him if I were you."
"SOOKIE: This wasn't how it was supposed to go."
"LORELAI: I know, sweetie, but give it time. It's a big thing."
"SOOKIE: He said he wanted this."
"LORELAI: He loves you, he wants this."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy."
"SOOKIE: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: Hang in there, I'll call you later."
"SOOKIE: I'll be here."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy."
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Several people are standing around Kirk, who has the mail spread out in a pile on the floor.]"
"DEAN: It's right there!"
"KIRK: Just a second."
"DEAN: I see it. Can I just "
"KIRK: Yeah, I can do it."
"DEAN: Kirk, it's right there!"
"KIRK: You are yelling at me, and I have to tell you that that is not the way to get results."
"DEAN: You keep passing it."
"KIRK: You are making me crazy."
"[Lorelai walks up to them]"
"LORELAI: Dean, I just need. . .oh, hey, that's my water bill."
"DEAN: He's been down there for twenty minutes."
"LORELAI: Kirk, you have to sort the mail first."
"KIRK: Everybody is always telling me what to do. Everybody else is always right. Well, I'm sorry, but I am the mail carrier in this town and I will carry the mail the way that I carry the mail, and if you don't like that, then you can carry the mail. But you'll have to apply for the job first and get hired. And there's a test, and it is a hard test, my friend. Ow, paper cut."
"LORELAI: Dean, I need some of that non-drowsy allergy medicine stuff."
"DEAN: Did you check in the back with the aspirin?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, nothing."
"DEAN: Then we're probably out. I could tell you when they're expected in, but I haven't gotten the mail yet."
"KIRK: Shut up."
"LORELAI: Okay, nevermind, I'll just grab some when I get to Hartford. See if you can get my water bill for me."
"DEAN: All right, I'll do my best. [to Kirk] I'm giving you five minutes to get up, then I'm getting the mop."
"KIRK: You will not touch this. This is the property of the United States Government."
"CUT TO HARTFORD DRUGSTORE"
"[Lorelai walks to the allergy medicine aisle and looks at the selection]"
"LORELAI: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, show me a difference, people. Why can't I pick one? Ooh, on sale, that's it, good, done."
"[Lorelai picks a medicine, then walks to the end of the aisle, where she sees Max]"
"LORELAI: Max."
"MAX: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MAX: Hi back."
"LORELAI: I didn't know you had a cold."
"MAX: I just recently found out myself."
"LORELAI: Well, wow. You. Hi. How have you been?"
"MAX: I've been good."
"LORELAI: Good."
"MAX: I've been in California."
"LORELAI: Well, cowabunga dude."
"MAX: Yes, that's my official California name."
"LORELAI: So, California, huh?"
"MAX: Stanford, actually. I was teaching a class there."
"LORELAI: Well, good. It's about time that dump got some decent teachers."
"MAX: Yes, they're really trying to turn the place around."
"LORELAI: Well, so, if you were living in California, then what are you doing back here?"
"MAX: Well, this place has the best selection."
"LORELAI: In Hartford."
"MAX: My class ended, and I thought I'd come back for the Chilton Bicentennial."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"MAX: What are you doing here in Hartford?"
"LORELAI: Friday night?"
"MAX: The infamous Gilmore dinners."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"MAX: How's that going?"
"LORELAI: Uh, great. We had to add on an extra room for all the emotional baggage, but other than that, there's been no bloodshed as of yet."
"MAX: Well, I'm glad to hear it. And Rory's good?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, she's the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of good."
"MAX: Grades?"
"LORELAI: Perfect."
"MAX: Same boyfriend?"
"LORELAI: Different boyfriend."
"MAX: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"MAX: You hate him."
"LORELAI: No, I don't."
"MAX: You really hate him."
"LORELAI: I smile, I say hi, I let him eat the good cookies."
"MAX: You wanna have him k*ll."
"LORELAI: Only if I get a really good price."
"MAX: She's young, she'll move on, she's got college next year."
"LORELAI: Great. Frat boys, I cannot wait."
"MAX: Just get a keg, keeps them distracted."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, thanks for the advice. I'm gonna lock her up in a tower when I get home."
"MAX: Glad I could help. Well, listen, I, um, have this dinner I have to get to."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, yeah. Me, too. Me, too. So. . ."
"MAX: It was nice to see you."
"LORELAI: It was nice to see you, too."
"MAX: Bye."
"LORELAI: Uh, bye."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai rings the doorbell, Richard answers the door]"
"RICHARD: Ah, you're here."
"LORELAI: And you are by far the most masculine-looking maid my parents have ever had."
"RICHARD: It's chaos here. The second maid called in sick, the first is busy with dinner, and your poor mother is at the hospital. Her DAR group suffered a surfeit of strokes this week."
"LORELAI: Come again?"
"RICHARD: Three of her friends had strokes. And now she is hopping from sick bed to sick bed offering whatever comfort she can."
"[they start walking to the living room]"
"LORELAI: Three DAR strokes. What's in that water they're drinking?"
"RICHARD: Well, a little whiskey, usually. Oh, and you're forgetting Liesl."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: Our East-German maid. She was much more masculine-looking than me."
"LORELAI: Right, the muttonchops."
"RICHARD: Here is Rory."
"LORELAI: Thanks, I wouldn't have recognized her. Hi hon."
"RORY: Hi. Did you hear about the strokes?"
"LORELAI: Yes, stay away from whiskey and the DAR."
"RICHARD: Your mother would make you throw that out at this point."
"LORELAI: How about I exchange it for a martini?"
"RICHARD: Ah, coming up. [phone rings] Oh, good I'm expecting an important call. This could be it."
"LORELAI: Uh, Dad, if the maid is busy with dinner and the second one's out and Mom's at the hospital. . . you know."
"RICHARD: Oh, right, right. I'll get it! [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Alone at last. Have I got something to tell you."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Or maybe you have something to tell me."
"RORY: Don't do that, I have nothing."
"LORELAI: Or are you minimizing what you know? Maybe you should maximize it."
"RORY: I'm confused."
"LORELAI: Maximize it."
"RORY: I'm maximum confused."
"LORELAI: I ran into Max."
"RORY: Medina?"
"LORELAI: At the pharmacy. Did you know he was back?"
"RORY: No. He was, like, on loan somewhere."
"LORELAI: Yeah, at Stanford. But he's back now, for a little while at least, and I am happy to report that either he's forgiven me for treating him so badly or it wasn't that bad and I just built it up worse in my head."
"RORY: Oh no, you treated him like crap"
"LORELAI: Well, he was very big about it. He didn't recoil or blow me off. We had a nice chat. It was good to see him."
"RORY: He's a great guy."
"LORELAI: He is."
"RORY: And a great teacher, too. I'm glad he's back."
"LORELAI: Good. He seems glad, too."
"[Richard returns to the room]"
"RICHARD: That was not my call, and for a second there, I thought a fourth friend of your mother's had had a stroke."
"RORY: Oh, no."
"RICHARD: But then I realized that it was one of the original stroke ladies' husband's calling to inform me of her stroke, which we already knew about, so here we are."
"LORELAI: Thank God."
"RICHARD: So, Rory has been telling me about the Chilton Bicentennial and her speech."
"RORY: Well, it's not my speech yet. I have to qualify for it."
"RICHARD: Oh, you'll get it."
"LORELAI: She'll be on C-SPAN if she does."
"RICHARD: Very good."
"RORY: It's not like anyone would watch it."
"LORELAI: Yes, they will. You're a hell of a lot more interesting than that usual sh*t they have of all the white men walking around that big empty chamber with the numbers all over them."
"RICHARD: That's a televised house vote, and I find that fascinating."
"LORELAI: It's like watching the Men's Warehouse security camera."
"RICHARD: When is your speech? I'd like to be there."
"RORY: Again, it's not my speech yet, but it's Friday at five."
"RICHARD: Oh, well, that's tough. Could they move it to six?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"RICHARD: Well, maybe I'll move my thing."
"RORY: That might be best."
"[phone rings]"
"RICHARD: Oh, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it!"
"[As Richard rushes out of the room, Lorelai laughs]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: [holds up her cell phone] Speed dial. I just like seeing him do that."
"RICHARD: [from other room] I've got it."

"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks up to the house, Sookie is sitting on the front porch swing]"
"SOOKIE: Ah, thank God, someone sane. Come on up."
"LORELAI: Your phone has been busy all night and I am dying to know what the doctor said."
"SOOKIE: He said, ""Congratulations, it's an It!"""
"LORELAI: Ah, I loved being pregnant."
"SOOKIE: You'll give me lots of tips?"
"LORELAI: Oh, what I can remember."
"SOOKIE: Get your diary out from that year cause I wanna know it all."
"LORELAI: A lot of my diary from that year was, um, a debate over which member of Tears for Fears I loved more at that particular moment."
"SOOKIE: That's probably not going to help me much."
"LORELAI: What are you doing out here? It's cold."
"SOOKIE: Well, we finished eating and I needed a break. Rough day. We didn't get home until eight."
"LORELAI: Eight? Your appointment was at six."
"SOOKIE: Jackson won't drive home faster than seven miles an hour. He doesn't wanna jiggle Baby."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: We spent ten minutes on one speed bump. I could've walked home faster. And he's got this wild look in his eye like he's some kind of death rocker or something, and he's making lots of calls, and he punched the calculator so much he broke it."
"[Jackson walks out of the house]"
"JACKSON: We're selling the truck."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"JACKSON: It's the only way we're going to afford the minivan."
"SOOKIE: I thought you broke the calculator."
"JACKSON: I'm using a pencil. Hi Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi Jackson, congratulations."
"SOOKIE: We don't need a van."
"JACKSON: And I'm getting a haircut and buying a second tie. [the phone rings] Oh, I'll get it. It's probably the contractor."
"SOOKIE: What contractor?"
"JACKSON: The add-on."
"SOOKIE: What add-on?"
"JACKSON: The expansion, Sookie, the expansion. [walks into the house]"
"SOOKIE: He's expanding something."
"LORELAI: He's, uh, being very cryptic."
"SOOKIE: I don't wanna expand anything. And did you see his eyes?"
"LORELAI: Tasmanian devil."
"SOOKIE: When I came home, he was baby-proofing the house, he'd thrown away all our prescription drugs, and he was stuffing newspaper into the electrical sockets. He's insane."
"[Jackson walks out with the phone]"
"JACKSON: [oh phone] Hold on, Tom. [to Sookie] He says we have to move out for three months to do the add-on. We probably don't wanna do that."
"SOOKIE: Probably not."
"[Jackson walks back into the house]"
"LORELAI: Have you tried slapping him?"
"SOOKIE: No, he won't let me lift my arm above my head in case it stretches Baby. This stinks. We never even got to celebrate. He went straight to budgets and minivans."
"LORELAI: Aw, well, what he's doing is sweet in its own obnoxious way."
"SOOKIE: I guess I'll have to let him be male."
"LORELAI: So, listen, um, I ran into Max Medina."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, really? How weird was that?"
"LORELAI: A little. Not as much as I would have thought."
"SOOKIE: He's such a good guy."
"LORELAI: Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that."
"SOOKIE: Well, was he nice to you?"
"LORELAI: Very. I mean, what happened with us was so long ago. Do you think what I did to him was really horrible?"
"SOOKIE: You mean dumping him in the gutter? Sure."
"LORELAI: Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that, too."
"SOOKIE: So, Max Medina's back."
"LORELAI: Not for long, though. I just hope he doesn't hate me. He was probably just being nice. I just don't want him to hate me."
"SOOKIE: You didn't mean to hurt him."
"LORELAI: I'll write him a note or something. I owe him that."
"[Jackson walks out of the house and holds up a cleaver.]"
"LORELAI/SOOKIE: Oh!"
"JACKSON: What is this?"
"SOOKIE: It's my cleaver."
"JACKSON: What if Baby fell on it?"
"SOOKIE: You mean, what if Baby rolled off the sink and into the open second drawer? It wouldn't be good."
"JACKSON: It has to go."
"SOOKIE: I need it to chop stuff."
"JACKSON: We're switching to plastic."
"SOOKIE: I can't use plastic."
"JACKSON: And the Saran Wrap's history, too."
"SOOKIE: Jackson!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks through the front door. The phone is ringing]"
"RORY: [answers phone] Hello?"
"WOMAN: Rory Gilmore, please."
"RORY: This is Rory Gilmore."
"WOMAN: Please hold. I'm connecting Headmaster Charleston and Paris Gellar."
"RORY: What? You're what, hello?"
"WOMAN: Miss Gilmore?"
"RORY: I'm here."
"WOMAN: Miss Gellar?"
"PARIS: I'm here."
"WOMAN: Please hold, I'm connecting Headmaster Charleston. [pause] Miss Gilmore, Miss Gellar, you have Headmaster Charleston."
"HEADMASTER: Ladies, hello. I hope you're having a pleasant evening."
"RORY: Yes, sir."
"PARIS: Very pleasant."
"HEADMASTER: Wonderful to hear. Well, let's get down to it, shall we? I was very impressed with both of your speeches today. They were well written, well researched, and eloquently delivered. You should be very proud."
"RORY: Thank you, we were."
"PARIS: Who won?"
"HEADMASTER: Just the simple act of completing a task well is in itself a win, is it not Miss Gellar?"
"PARIS: Yes, sir."
"HEADMASTER: Wonderful. Anyhow, as I was listening to you both this afternoon, a thought kept rolling around in my head. I was thinking what a pity it is I will have to choose just one. But then I realized, Hold on a minute here. I'm the headmaster at this school, I'm in charge of this competition, I can change the rules if I wish to.' So I am."
"RORY: You are?"
"PARIS: You are what?"
"HEADMASTER: I am changing the rules. Instead of having one speaker at our bicentennial, we will have two. You will combine your speeches and present them together."
"PARIS: You're kidding."
"HEADMASTER: I assure you I am not. I think it will be an excellent way to pay proper tribute to our school. So, what do you think of my little plan?"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"PARIS: It's, uh. . ."
"HEADMASTER: Brilliant. Yes, I think so, too. That's all. Congratulations. I would like the revised copy of your speech on my desk by Tuesday. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. [hangs up]"
"PARIS: Well, look who's suddenly decided to become Kofi Annan."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"PARIS: Charleston thinks we need to play nice with each other, so he screws up the whole bicentennial. This sucks."
"RORY: Yes, it does suck."
"PARIS: So, what do we do now?"
"RORY: Do we have a choice?"
"PARIS: Of course we have a choice. You could say no."
"RORY: Why could I say no? You could say no."
"PARIS: I could not say no. C-SPAN is going to be there."
"RORY: Well, I like C-SPAN as much as you do."
"PARIS: You do not."
"RORY: I do, too. Ask my mom, it's all I talk about."
"PARIS: So, I guess we need a game plan now."
"RORY: Okay. We can meet at school tomorrow and work on it."
"PARIS: Or we could do it over the phone."
"RORY: Over the phone?"
"PARIS: We're just combining two speeches, Rory. There's no reason we have to sit in the same room and stare at each other."
"RORY: Fine, whatever you want."
"PARIS: Tomorrow night, six o'clock, I'll call you."
"RORY: I can't wait."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[The doorbell rings. Rory answers the door, Paris is standing there]"
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"PARIS: We have a speech to write."
"RORY: Yes, but we were supposed to do it over the phone. That was the plan."
"PARIS: Well, it's a ridiculous plan. We have to put two speeches together. We have to rehearse them, we have to hone our timing. None of that can be done effectively over the phone."
"RORY: But it was your idea."
"PARIS: Oh, like you fought me on it?"
"RORY: Of course I didn't fight you on it."
"PARIS: Well, okay then."
"RORY: What, okay then? Our conversation did not just come to a close. There was not a decision made back there just now."
"PARIS: Look, I'm here, we should just do this and get it over with. Do you wanna study here or in your bedroom? Fine, I'll go to a payphone. Do you have payphones in this town or are you still using a town crier?"
"RORY: We'll do it here."
"PARIS: Whatever you say."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"PARIS: So, I think the first thing to do is to acquaint ourselves with each others' speeches so we can judge who hit which point best. Here. [hands Rory her speech]"
"RORY: Mine. [hands Paris her speech]"
"PARIS: Good. Let's read. Why did you use this font?"
"RORY: Because I was on the crack."
"PARIS: Did you check these facts?"
"RORY: Yes, I did."
"PARIS: And the spelling of these names?"
"RORY: Yes, I did."
"PARIS: Rory?"
"RORY: What, Paris?"
"PARIS: I slept with Jamie. Last night, after we talked."
"RORY: Was it something I said?"
"PARIS: I went over there to study and he lit a fire and then we did it. What are your thoughts on that?"
"RORY: My thoughts?"
"PARIS: Because I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it myself yet. I've been going over it in my head. I mean, it seemed to go pretty well. The fire was nice and thank God he didn't try to put on any ridiculous makeout music, and then it just happened. I was actually fairly surprised at the timing of it because I wasn't wearing anything particularly alluring, and in the moments just before the act. . ."
"RORY: Oh, God."
"PARIS: We were actually discussing modern day Marxism in America, which is not what I would have deemed a come and get it' sort of conversation, but nevertheless, he came and got it, and I have to figure out what that means to me on a psychological level. So, I thought maybe if you and I could have sort of a healthy debate about it, I could come to some sort of reasonable conclusion about how I should be feeling right about now. So, come on, talk. What do you think?"
"RORY: I "
"PARIS: Are you pro?"
"RORY: Well "
"PARIS: Con?"
"RORY: Well "
"PARIS: Undecided?"
"RORY: Paris, just stop talking for one second and let me get my mind around this."
"PARIS: Sorry, go ahead, focus."
"[Lorelai walks in through the front door and overhears their conversation from the hall]"
"PARIS: Could you focus faster because I really need some feedback here."
"RORY: Okay, so you are telling me that you and Jamie. . ."
"PARIS: Had sex."
"RORY: Okay, so, were you safe?"
"PARIS: Yes, it was a regular after school special."
"RORY: Well, was he nice to you?"
"PARIS: Yes, he was very nice to me."
"RORY: And the two of you had discussed this. . ."
"PARIS: Well, I don't know that we actually discussed it, it was just sort of implied."
"RORY: Implied?"
"PARIS: Yes, implied. When you're dating a boy and you're together for a given amount of time and you're not Amish, then the eventual occurrence of intercourse is inevitable. I mean, wasn't it with you?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: With Dean."
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: No?"
"RORY: No. I never did it with Dean."
"PARIS: Oh. Well, then with Jess, right?"
"RORY: Um, no."
"PARIS: You're lying."
"RORY: No, I'm not lying."
"PARIS: You haven't?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Why not?"
"RORY: I just haven't. It's just not the time."
"[Lorelai quietly walks back out of the house]"
"PARIS: Why is it not the time? I mean, if it's not the time for you, then maybe it's not the time for me either."
"RORY: Paris, you can't judge what's right for you against what's right for me. I mean, we are different, and Jamie and Jess are different."
"PARIS: Well, yeah."
"RORY: Maybe it was the time for the two of you."
"PARIS: I guess. I just wish I had the data to back it up."
"RORY: Some things can't be analyzed."
"PARIS: Listen, Rory, these last few weeks, Francie got things all twisted around."
"RORY: You let her get things all twisted around."
"PARIS: I know. I just tend to believe the worst in people, you know?"
"RORY: Oh yeah, I know."
"PARIS: I'm. . ."
"RORY: That's okay."
"LORELAI: [from kitchen] Hello, Mommy's home!"
"RORY: We're in here."
"LORELAI: We're, who's we're? Oh, hey Paris. I didn't know you were coming over tonight."
"PARIS: It wasn't planned."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I brought pizza if you guys are hungry."
"PARIS: I have to take my retainer out first."
"RORY: I'll get the plates."
"[Paris walks toward the bathroom, Lorelai hugs Rory]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: I'm taking you shopping tomorrow."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: It just seems time. . .for new shoes."
"RORY: Okay. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: I've got the good kid."
"CUT TO CHILTON AUDITORIUM"
"[The headmaster is on stage addressing the audience]"
"HEADMASTER: . . .of two hundred years of tradition, Chilton begins its third century of educating this country's young students. . ."
"[Rory is waiting in the hallway outside the auditorium. Lorelai walks over to her]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I got the coats hung, and I slipped the girl a buck to get the really good hangers. You know, the ones with the dry cleaning foam strips still attached. Why are you frowning? Are you nervous?"
"RORY: What? No. I mean, yes. Paris is supposed to be here and she's not."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe she's just had a clothing crisis."
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Do you wanna call her?"
"RORY: I did, no answer."
"LORELAI: I'm sure she's fine, there's traffic. Just relax."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Richard walks up to them]"
"RICHARD: There you are."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Grandpa, you came."
"RICHARD: Of course I came. I wouldn't miss my granddaughter talking on national TV. That's quite a nice turnout you have here."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, we're very proud of the number of people who have nothing to do on a Friday night."
"RICHARD: Your mind never tires for a moment, does it?"
"LORELAI: It will once people start talking."
"RICHARD: Charming."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I'm gonna go track down some coffee cause there's no way they're not serving coffee at this thing. I'll be right back. Relax, she'll be here."
"CUT TO ANOTHER HALLWAY"
"[On her way to the coffee table, Lorelai passes Max, who is talking to someone]"
"MAX: [to man] Stanford has been really fantastic."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MAX: Hi. [to man] Will you excuse me for a moment?"
"MAN: Sure."
"[Max follows Lorelai to the coffee table]"
"MAX: We seem to be running into each other a lot lately."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on, you know where there's C-SPAN, there's. . .me."
"MAX: Is Rory around?"
"LORELAI: Um, she's looking for Paris and panicking she's gonna have to do this alone."
"MAX: Well, Paris'll come."
"LORELAI: I told her that. Listen, do you have a second?"
"MAX: Sure."
"LORELAI: I just, um. . .I just wanna talk to you about. . .uh. . ."
"[they walk to an empty classroom]"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to get away from. . .anyhow. We just haven't really talked since. . ."
"MAX: No, we haven't."
"LORELAI: I always meant to call you, but I'm not good at calling when a call is really necessary. And then, you know, uh, if you don't call for awhile, it gets harder to call, and then after awhile, it feels like it's too late to call, and so you don't, although you always know that you should've called, and I should've called."
"MAX: It's okay."
"LORELAI: No, it's not. I never really explained what happened."
"MAX: You didn't marry me."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know, but I never really explained why. I just didn't."
"MAX: You didn't love me."
"LORELAI: I don't think I didn't love you. I think. . .I think I was not ready to get married."
"MAX: Because you didn't love me."
"LORELAI: No, I really don't think that was it. Sometimes the person you love is not the person you're ready to live with forever. I'm not saying this is right, but "
"MAX: Lorelai, listen to me. I appreciate this, I really do, but there's no need for it. I'm really okay."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I know you're. . .no, I'm sure you're okay. I'm not saying this because you don't look okay. You look great. Really great. Although, I'm not saying this because you look really great, although you do. Did you join a gym in California?"
"MAX: Lorelai, look. I've always wanted to teach at a university like Stanford. And finally, the opportunity came up, I went, and it was wonderful. And, frankly, if we had been getting married, I wouldn't have been able to take it."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"MAX: And being away gave me time to think. I thought, and now I'm fine."
"LORELAI: It's just, we never had any closure."
"MAX: Life's not really about closure, is it?"
"LORELAI: No, I guess not. So, you're okay?"
"MAX: I'm okay. I'm over it."
"LORELAI: You sure?"
"MAX: I am completely sure."
"LORELAI: Well, then. . .boy, don't I feel stupid."
"MAX: You are many things, but stupid is not one of them."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm really glad I got to see you again."
"MAX: Me, too. I better get back."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM"
"[Rory and Richard are waiting in the hallway. The headmaster walks over to them.]"
"HEADMASTER: Rory, you and Paris should get ready, you're going on next. Richard, I didn't know you were coming, how are you?"
"RICHARD: Very, very well, Hanlin."
"HEADMASTER: Wonderful. Here, let me find you a seat."
"RICHARD: Ah, I'm also with my daughter."
"HEADMASTER: Well, then let me find you two seats. Rory, where's Paris?"
"RORY: I don't know, I haven't seen her and I called her house."
"HEADMASTER: Oh, dear. Well, I hope you know both parts. [walks away]"
"RORY: Okay, great."
"RICHARD: You are going to be wonderful, trust me. Now, did anyone ever to tell you to picture the audience in their underwear?"
"RORY: Yes."
"RICHARD: Well, don't do it. I did it once and I had nightmares for a week. Bulgarians in Speedos."
"RORY: Say no more."
"[Lorelai walks over to them]"
"LORELAI: Hey, they're rounding us up. Is she here yet?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, just. . .oh, there she is."
"RORY: Where? [sees Paris down the hall] Oh, thank you God."
"LORELAI: Okay, be great. We'll see you afterward."
"RORY: [walks over to Paris] Where have you been? Paris, you okay?"
"CUT TO AUDITORIUM"
"[The headmaster is addressing the audience]"
"HEADMASTER: And it is with great pleasure that I introduce two young ladies that epitomize the very best of what Chilton has to offer."
"RORY: Paris, are you okay?"
"HEADMASTER: Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore."
"[The crowd applauds as Rory and Paris walk onto the stage]"
"RORY: ""Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then do something. Don't just stand there, make it happen."" Lee Iacocca. ""Education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one."" Malcolm Forbes. ""Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught."" Oscar Wilde. These are only three of many countless views on the expansion of the human mind. I personally believe in all of them, and fortunately for me, so does Chilton. An institution not just because of age and standing, but because of ideas. Because it encourages ideas and it will accept nothing less than everything you have to give. This is the place where our lives start."
"PARIS: You know, it's funny, me standing here before you right now. I've thought about nothing else for four years but this school, this big important school with all of its history and tradition and really super teachers. And I dedicated myself to it completely, heart and soul, believing in its power, believing in its ability to get me where I needed to go. Harvard. I thought of nothing else. Many of you out there can attest to that fact. I was on my way and nothing could stop me. And here's the really funny thing  after four years of slaving away, I go home today and I found this. [holds up an envelope] I'm not going to Harvard. I got the tiny envelope, the one that reads, ""Sorry, Paris. We're not interested. Try again next year. Love, Harvard."" And the thing that's really funny here is, who in the world deserves to go to Harvard more than me? Have you seen how hard I've worked over these past four years? I mean, can anyone here believe that I'm not going to Harvard? I can't. I'm not going to Harvard. I am not going to Harvard. I had sex, but I'm not going to Harvard."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: And I have to tell you that if you asked me which of those two events I thought would be the least likely to happen, it would not be the not going to Harvard."
"RORY: Thank you and good night."
"PARIS: I'm being punished. I had sex, so now I don't get to go to Harvard."
"RORY: Paris, come on. [leads Paris off the stage]"
"PARIS: She's never had sex. She'll probably go to Harvard. She's a shoe in. Pack your chastity belt, Gilmore  you're going to Harvard!"
"RORY: Come on!"
"[In the audience, Lorelai glances at Richard, who is sleeping]"
"CUT TO BACKSTAGE"
"[Rory and Paris sit on a staircase. Paris is crying]"
"PARIS: How could I have not gotten into Harvard? Five generations of Gellars have gotten into Harvard. Even if I was the Billy Carter of the family, the name is still supposed to carry some weight."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: They had to really not like me for me to not get in."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: It's like they know me or something."
"RORY: Stop. I know how much this meant to you, Paris, but you are going to get just as good an education at one of the other great schools you're destined to get into. And you know what? Maybe it's a good thing that you're going to a different school than the rest of your family. You'll be doing your own thing, starting your own tradition. Doesn't that sound exciting?"
"PARIS: I can't believe I slept with Jamie. I'm a slut."
"RORY: No, you're not. You love him."
"PARIS: What if he doesn't love me anymore? What if he doesn't think I'm special anymore? How am I going to tell him I didn't get into Harvard? What am I gonna do?"
"RORY: Paris, I don't know why you didn't get into Harvard, but you are so smart and so special and you'll see, everything's gonna be fine."
"[Lorelai opens the door]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay."
"RORY: Yeah, we've got everything under control, thanks."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll be outside when you're ready. No rush."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Lorelai leaves]"
"PARIS: Well, all I've gotta say is, after all the trouble this sex thing has caused me, I better have been good."
"RORY: That's the perspective I know and love."
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai walks up to Richard by the coat racks]"
"LORELAI: Dad, hi, sorry. I was just checking on the girls."
"RICHARD: Well, I hope they're feeling very good about themselves. They did a wonderful job."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I'm sure they'll be very pleased to hear you think so."
"RICHARD: Listen, um, I need to get home. Uh, I'm expecting a very important call from China that unfortunately I cannot miss."
"LORELAI: That's fine, Dad. I'll tell Rory you had to go."
"RICHARD: All right. And tell her I'll call her later, and give her this. [hands Lorelai an envelope]"
"LORELAI: Aw, that's very nice. Now how about my finder's fee?"
"RICHARD: You're very amusing. Thank you for a lovely evening, and I'll see the two of you on Friday."
"LORELAI: Good night. Sleep tight."
"[Richard leaves]"
"LORELAI: [to coat-check woman] Um, excuse me, hi. I am not seeing my coat here, and it was very cute and it was on sale, and I will fling myself off a building if I lose it."
"WOMAN: We put some of the coat racks in the classroom over there, take a look. Otherwise the staircase to the roof is on your right."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Hm. Took two hundred years, but somebody at Chilton finally cracked a joke."
"CUT TO CLASSROOM"
"[Lorelai walks in and finds her coat in the racks. Max walks in]"
"MAX: Okay. So, this is where they keep the coats they're ashamed of."
"LORELAI: Well, this school has taken snobbery to a whole new level."
"MAX: So, is Rory okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I just went back there. She's taking care of Paris, but she's good, thanks."
"MAX: I must say, I've been a teacher for ten years now, and it wasn't until today I realized, it must be really hard to be a girl."
"LORELAI: And with the invention of Sephora, really expensive, too."
"MAX: I'm very sorry."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't be. At least we get to wear skirts without being Scottish or riding a float in the gay pride parade."
"MAX: Well, that'll change someday my friend, and when it does, I still won't wear a skirt. But I'll applaud those that do, and then cross the street so nobody sees I'm with them."
"LORELAI: It was nice seeing you."
"MAX: Nice to see you, too."
"LORELAI: Take care of yourself."
"MAX: I will."
"[They kiss]"
"MAX: And apparently, I'm not over it."
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S BEDROOM"
"[Jackson taps Sookie on the shoulder]"
"SOOKIE: I'm not getting rid of my knives, Jackson. I'm a chef, I have to have knives."
"JACKSON: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: And I'm also not cutting off the water supply and I'm not sanding down all the edges of my furniture. Now, I'm sorry that you think this house is a deathtrap, and I'm sorry that you think there is nothing in our lifestyles that is conducive to having a baby, but our kid is gonna have to be bright enough not to disconnect the water hose that goes to the a*t*matic ice maker and shove it up his or her nose. Now go to sleep."
"JACKSON: Did I tell you how happy I am?"
"SOOKIE: No, you didn't."
"JACKSON: I have never been happier about anything in my entire life."
"SOOKIE: Really?"
"JACKSON: Our wedding day, but this is running a really close second."
"SOOKIE: Jackson."
"JACKSON: Now if you would just get rid of the knives, I think it could make it a tie. I wasn't kidding about the knives."
"SOOKIE: Goodnight Jackson."
"JACKSON: If I could read you the statistics just one more time."
"SOOKIE: I love you, Jackson."
"JACKSON: Hold on, I'll find them."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk across the yard toward the mailbox]"
"RORY: But "
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: What does this mean?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: What are you gonna do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: What about Alex?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: But is Max going to "
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, have you gotten the clue? There's not gonna be a wealth of information tonight."
"RORY: Sorry. [they stop at the mailbox] It's just so. . ."
"[Lorelai opens the mailbox. She pulls out a large envelope and hands it to Rory]"
"LORELAI: The big one."
"RORY: Looks like Paris was right."
"[Lorelai pulls out two more large envelopes]"
"LORELAI: Apparently, you are the biggest virgin in the world. Wow. So, what?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Well, what does this mean?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Which one are you gonna choose?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: I guess we better go inside. We both have a lot of things to figure out, huh?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: Yeah. So what are the odds that Paris is ever gonna have sex again in this lifetime?"
"RORY: I don't know."

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table with papers and books spread out in front of them.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, let's see. Looks like Harvard definitely has the smallest class sizes."
"RORY: Okay, we've got our first entry here. It's a pro for Harvard."
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, whoa, those are not the final official pro/con lists."
"RORY: Why? What's wrong with them?"
"LORELAI: Well, the lines are crooked, the printing's all sloppy. Harvard, Princeton and Yale cannot see them looking like that."
"RORY: They're not going to see our pro/con lists."
"LORELAI: What if they subpoena them?"
"RORY: Then I'll roll them up in a ball and eat them."
"LORELAI: Oh, a big pro for Yale  they have 1100 members of the maintenance staff. Clean, clean, clean."
"RORY: All three of these places probably have the same number."
"LORELAI: But Yale must be crowing about it for some reason. Princeton might only have two."
"RORY: Two?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: You think there're a total of two guys cleaning all of Princeton?"
"LORELAI: Write ""Princeton's stinking filthy"" in big letters."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm pretending to write it as we speak."
"[Kirk walks over carrying a box of T-shirts]"
"KIRK: Good morning, ladies. May I interest you in a shirt?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Kirk. You're not selling your laundry again, are ya?"
"KIRK: No, these are part of my latest money-making endeavor. I'm going to print daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline of something I witness around town."
"RORY: Neat."
"KIRK: I got the idea when I read about something a man was doing in Portland."
"LORELAI: What was he doing?"
"KIRK: He was printing daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline of something he witnessed around town."
"RORY: Is that today's?"
"KIRK: Sure is. [he holds up a shirt]"
"RORY: [reads] ""Babette ate oatmeal."" Huh."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"KIRK: I'm keeping it real."
"RORY: It's good."
"LORELAI: It paints a picture."
"RORY: I can just see her. . .eating oatmeal."
"[Luke walks up to the table]"
"KIRK: They're $14.95. How many can I put you down for?"
"LUKE: No solicitors, Kirk."
"KIRK: How about if I cut you in for a piece of the action?"
"LUKE: How about I toss the shirts out the door first so you can have something to land on?"
"KIRK: Got it. [walks away]"
"LUKE: What's with the lists?"
"LORELAI: You ready? My Rory, our Rory, Stars Hollow's Rory. . .got into Harvard, Princeton, and Yale."
"LUKE: Wow, wow, wow, I can't believe it. I  I feel like I. . ."
"RORY: Yeah."
"[Luke awkwardly hugs Rory's head]"
"RORY: Oh."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"[Luke pulls back]"
"LUKE: Oh, I'm not good at hugging."
"RORY: Oh, I thought it worked."
"LUKE: Thanks. Man, this is big, right?"
"RORY: Very big."
"LUKE: But what's with all the pro/con lists?"
"LORELAI: That's how we make our important decisions, you know that."
"LUKE: But you know what it's gonna be, Harvard."
"RORY: Probably."
"LORELAI: But not necessarily."
"LUKE: But Harvard's all you've talked about for years."
"LORELAI: Well, who knew she'd be wanted by everyone?"
"LUKE: Hey, which school best teaches how to make an important life decision without doing a stupid pro/con list? Whichever one it is, add it to the pro column."
"LORELAI: Do not mock the sciencificity of our selection process."
"RORY: I've gotta head to school."
"LORELAI: Hey, why go anymore? You're in college. Let's go truffle hunting or something."
"RORY: Maybe after I graduate."
"LORELAI: All right, but if all the good truffles are gone, don't say I didn't warn you."
"RORY: Bye. [leaves]"
"LUKE: I can't believe how great that is, all three."
"LORELAI: Well, they have good taste."
"LUKE: Well. . .you know, uh, Jess also. . .well, it's so tiny compared to this, it's gonna sound dumb."
"LORELAI: What? Tell me."
"LUKE: Well, you know how Jess works at Wal-Mart."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do."
"LUKE: Well, it seems he was actually chosen Employee of the Month."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: I knew it would sound tiny."
"LORELAI: No, Luke, that's not tiny. That's really good."
"LUKE: Yeah. I mean, there's probably hundreds of people working at that branch, and they singled him out."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it shows he can work hard and get along with people and all that. You should be proud. Did you tell him you're proud?"
"LUKE: Well, he didn't even tell me about it. I got a letter addressed to the family of Jess Mariano inviting me down to some little ceremony they're having."
"LORELAI: Are you going?"
"LUKE: Oh, he'd hate it if I was there. You know, seeing him participating in some corporate ceremony like that, being called upstanding and responsible, it would k*ll him. Yeah, I'm going."
"LORELAI: Good boy."
"[Luke sees that Kirk is trying to sell his shirts at another table. Kirk quickly pushes the shirts off the table into a box]"

"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey Sookie, Sookie. . .where's Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Down here."
"LORELAI: Down where? Marco?"
"SOOKIE: Polo."
"[Lorelai finds Sookie kneeling on the floor next to a cat]"
"LORELAI: Why are you down there?"
"SOOKIE: Papaya won't eat, so I'm pretending to eat out of her bowl so she'll copy me."
"LORELAI: Sookie, you named the cat?"
"SOOKIE: She looks like a Papaya, doesn't she?"
"LORELAI: But it's a stray. You'll get close to it and it'll wander off and you'll be sad."
"SOOKIE: I'm keeping my distance. Come on, Papaya. Lap, lap, lap."
"LORELAI: All right, we're getting you up here. Come on."
"[Lorelai helps Sookie stand up]"
"SOOKIE: Oh boy, being a cat is hard on the knees."
"LORELAI: Since when are you a cat person?"
"SOOKIE: Well, ever since I got pregnant, I've become very nurturing toward all living things. Jackson, too."
"LORELAI: Well, both your bodies are changing."
"SOOKIE: Yesterday.. .ugh, it was awful. Jackson moved a table and just kind of nicked this spider. He didn't see the little thing, and just clipped one of its legs. And it was having trouble walking and we were so upset, but Jackson made a new leg for it out of a paper clip, but jamming the clip into the spider k*ll it instantly. Little Satchmo."
"LORELAI: You named the spider Satchmo?"
"SOOKIE: After Jackson's uncle."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure he'll be very touched."
"SOOKIE: Maybe if I wore ears!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"[Sookie holds two napkins up behind her head to look like cat ears, then kneels back down on the floor]"
"SOOKIE: Papaya! Look at Mommy, look at Mommy, look at Mommy."
"[Lorelai walks into the lobby]"
"LORELAI: Oh, is this everyone from the Edgar Allen Poe Society?"
"MICHEL: If you mean the I-should-be-sterilized-so-that-my-disturbing-idiosyncrasies-aren't-passed-onto-the-next-generation society, then yes, that's them."
"LORELAI: [to guests checking in] Hi, welcome to the Independence Inn."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Thank you. We're Jim and Milly Hatlestad."
"LORELAI: Okay, I've got you right here. Well, once again, welcome, and let me assure you there are no human body parts buried in the floor of your room to keep you awake tonight. Sound good?"
"MR. HATLESTAD: I guess."
"LORELAI: Room 8."
"[The Hatlestads walk away]"
"LORELAI: The Tell-Tale Heart. That's a Poe story. Did they not get that?"
"MICHEL: The Hatlestads are not with the Poe Society."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you tell me that?"
"MICHEL: If I had thought to, I still would not have."
"FRED: Hi, my name is Larson, I'm checking in."
"LORELAI: Poe Society, right?"
"FRED: That's me."
"LORELAI: Good. Well, welcome to the Independence Inn. There will be a complimentary cask of amontillado on the table in your room, and if you're expecting your friends Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, I'll send up another one. [pause] You said you were with the Poe Society."
"FRED: Yeah, but it's just a hobby. We're not Trekkies."
"LORELAI: No, no, I didn't mean to imply. . .I mean, you're not freaks, no way. Here, room six."
"FRED: Thank you. [walks away]"
"MICHEL: You might want to stop trying to cute things up."
"LORELAI: I hear that."
"MICHEL: [to guest] Hello sir."
"CUT TO WAL-MART BREAK ROOM"
"[The manager walks to the front of the room. Luke walks in and sits down in back.]"
"MANAGER: Hello everybody. Hope you're having a good day today. You folks know we do this every month, just a little get together to honor our new Employee of the Month. Nothing fancy, just a quick thanks' and a way to go.' Oh, and there's two hundred bucks in it. I think that's how we got our honoree to even show up to this thing. You know him as a trooper, our Mr. Reliable. The first time this young man sat down on that forklift, well, it was like an extension of himself. And yeah, he's not one for small talk, but this boy's production is out of sight. It's Jess Mariano everybody."
"[The other employees applaud as Jess walks up to accept a plaque]"
"MANAGER: Would you like to say anything Jess?"
"JESS: Nope."
"MANAGER: Well, that's our Jess. Give him another hand folks, and, uh, have a good one."
"[Jess walks to the back of the room and sees Luke]"
"JESS: What are you doing here?"
"LUKE: [pinches Jess' cheek] I'm so proud of my boy."
"JESS: Stop it."
"LUKE: Do you have a tissue because I think I'm gonna be emotional."
"JESS: I mean it, stop, now. It came with cash, it's the only reason I'm here."
"LUKE: Don't forget the plaque. You should hang that over your bed, shine a little spotlight over it."
"JESS: I gotta get back to work."
"LUKE: Yeah, the forklift's going where's the extension of me?'"
"[Jess leaves. The manager walks over to Luke]"
"MANAGER: Hey. Saw you jawboning with our boy there. I'm Bill Borden."
"LUKE: Luke Danes, I'm Jess' uncle."
"MANAGER: Nice meeting you."
"LUKE: Yeah, so he's doing good, huh?"
"MANAGER: Wish I had a dozen more Jesses. He's my go-to guy."
"LUKE: That's great to hear."
"MANAGER: Works like a dog on his regular shift, and if someone calls in sick  and they always do  Jess is there even if he's already done forty hours that week."
"LUKE: Wow, I am so . . .forty hours? He never works forty hours."
"MANAGER: More like forty-five, that's what I'm saying. Good boy, that one."
"LUKE: Wait, how is that possible? He's got school, he works for me, it can't be forty."
"MANAGER: Well, I can't say I sign every time card, but I'm pretty sure it's at least that. Uh, maybe I'm mistaken."
"LUKE: Yeah, maybe."
"MANAGER: Oh, thought you might like this. A little keepsake for ya. [hands him an Employee of the Month sign with Jess' picture on it]"
"LUKE: Great, thanks."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO"
"[A man dressed as Poe is reciting The Raven at the front of the room.]"
"POE 1: Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, ""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven."""
"LORELAI: [quietly to Rory] That Poe was downright funalicious."
"RORY: He was a troubled man. He enjoyed a little bit too much of the hmm-hmm. [makes a drinking gesture]"
"LORELAI: Mime?"
"RORY: You know what I meant."
"LORELAI: Oh, mime. That reminds me  Yale, best drama school bar none. Put that in the pro column."
"RORY: I'm not taking drama."
"LORELAI: No, but it means you'll have the best on-campus productions. You'll get to see the next Meryl Streep all goofy and eighteen and doing crap like, ""Hey, name an occupation!"" ""Plumber!"" ""Name a farm tool now!"" ""Tractor!"" ""Hey, I'm a tractor doing. . .plumbing."""
"RORY: That's what the do at the Yale drama school?"
"LORELAI: So I've heard. Oh, that's weird."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Over there. [points to another man dressed like Poe seated in the audience]"
"RORY: A second Poe?"
"LORELAI: It's like a Poe story in itself."
"RORY: The Case of the Two Poes."
"LORELAI: The Messrs Poe and Poe."
"RORY: Oh, that's good."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, there's Dean. Hey, is that, uh. . ."
"RORY: That's Lindsay."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[Dean sees them and waves. Lindsay glances at Rory]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I think she's ready to go to the ghetto on you."
"RORY: Well, I don't have a problem with her. She's really nice. And, you know, once she "
"LORELAI: Bought you a magnet shaped like Mark Twain's head? Yes, I've heard the anecdote."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: I think she should just mellow. I mean, you've both moved on. What's the problem?"
"POE 1: But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only that one word. . ."
"LORELAI: I don't remember The Raven being this long."
"RORY: It could've used some editing."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, did you put drama school on the Yale pro list?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Come on, do it, we'll forget."
"RORY: I don't have a pen."
"LORELAI: Aw, jeez. [leans toward Luke and Nicole sitting across the aisle] Hey, psst. Hi, Nicole."
"NICOLE: Hi, Lorelai."
"LUKE: Hey, how long is this thing?"
"LORELAI: He's got at least five nevermores to go."
"LUKE: Ah, jeez."
"LORELAI: Do you got a pen?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Come on, cough it up."
"LUKE: I don't have a pen."
"LORELAI: You've got a restaurant. Where's the pen you take orders with?"
"LUKE: I wasn't anticipating taking orders at the Poe reading."
"LORELAI: Hm, there goes your Boy Scout badge."
"RORY: Uh, Mom."
"[Poe 1 gives her a look, then continues]"
"POE 1: Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy. . ."
"LORELAI: Busted by a Poe."
"RORY: Hope he doesn't put a curse on us."
"LORELAI: Or complain when he goes back to being Fred Larson, Tampa dentist."
"NICOLE: Hey, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hm? [sees Nicole holding out a pen] Oh, you're an angel, thanks."
"NICOLE: I'll need it back."
"LORELAI: Yeah, sure."
"RORY: Hm, looks like Nicole's got a little Lindsay attitude going."
"LORELAI: Not really. Really?"
"MISS PATTY: Hey, how many nevermores do you think he's got to go?"
"LORELAI: We're guessing four."
"MISS PATTY: Poor Edgar Allen Poe, he suffered so much. And now we gotta suffer along with him."
"RORY: Yale drama, got it."
"MISS PATTY: Rory, why do you waste your time on those pro/con lists? It's going to be Harvard, we all know it."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: If the list says it is."
"RORY: Right."
"MISS PATTY: When you were six and took my cheerleading class, you wouldn't even cheer for any other school than Harvard."
"RORY: That's true. That is true."
"LORELAI: Well, then the list will reflect it."
"POE 1: And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted. . .nevermore."
"[the audience claps]"
"LORELAI: Excellent. Bravo, bravo."
"RORY: Very nice."
"WOMAN: That was wonderful, wasn't it? Thank you very much for that rendition."
"POE 1: Thank you."
"[he goes to sit down and the second Poe walks to the front]"
"LORELAI: What's with the Poes?"
"RORY: They look upset."
"MISS PATTY: Wanna hear the scoop?"
"RORY: Please."
"MISS PATTY: I was here when they both arrived. They got their signals crossed. They were supposed to perform different things, but they both came to do The Raven."
"LORELAI: If the Poes start fighting, does that punch a hole in the space/time continuum?"
"RORY: And throw us into a universe where everything is the exact opposite of what it is here?"
"LORELAI: Cool. There'll be funny sitcoms there."
"WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special treat for you. It'll allow you to compare and contrast interpretations of Poe's most famous work."
"RORY: Oh no."
"LORELAI: Compare and contrast?"
"RORY: That can only mean. . ."
"WOMAN: Please enjoy this second recitation of The Raven."
"LORELAI: Do we bolt?"
"RORY: Do we dare?"
"LORELAI: At least if I'd brought a flask, we could've played the nevermore drinking game."
"RORY: Oh, maybe this is what drove Poe to the bottle."
"LORELAI: His own work."
"POE 2: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping. . ."
"[Lorelai and Nicole share a look; Rory and Lindsay share a look]"
"LORELAI: Weird vibe in here. Very Poe."
"RORY: Very Poe."
"CUT TO OUTISDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the dance studio]"
"RORY: Well, that was pretty good."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on. You can't do that thing where you complain, then when you walk out you reassess based on the relief you're feeling that it's over."
"RORY: Well, I was able to compare and contrast between readings."
"LORELAI: I was able to nap for twenty minutes."
"[The first Poe walks over to them]"
"POE 1: Good evening, ladies."
"LORELAI: Oh, hi Poe."
"RORY: Good job in there."
"POE 1: I thank you. Young miss, do correct me, but I heard tell that you are considering attending Harvard University."
"RORY: I am."
"POE 1: I myself attended West Point."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"POE 1: I'm embarrassed to say that I was court-martialed in 1832 and forced to leave."
"[The second Poe walks over]"
"POE 2: Excuse me, but I was expelled from West Point in 1831, not 1832."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"POE 1: No, I do believe it was 1832. It was an election year."
"POE 2: It was not an election year. President Jackson was to serve five more years"
"POE 1: I'm sure it was '32. I'm sad to say it was the same year my older brother William passed away."
"POE 2: Okay, that's not right either, Fred."
"POE 1: Fred? I don't know this Fred you speak of."
"POE 2: Oh, knock it off. I'm tired. [walks away]"
"POE 1: Will you excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. [he walks away] Poes are very testy people."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"[Kirk is sitting at a table with stacks of T-shirts]"
"KIRK: I've got your latest topical T-shirts here, people. Brand new topical T-shirts for sale."
"RORY: What's this one say?"
"[Kirk holds one up]"
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Faux Poes foes."""
"RORY: Very clever, Kirk."
"KIRK: It was an inspiration. But they're not selling much better than the ""Babette ate oatmeal"" shirts."
"LORELAI: Keep the dream, Kirk."
"[Dean and Lindsay walk out of the dance studio]"
"DEAN: Hey guys."
"RORY: Oh, hi. Mom, this is Lindsay."
"LINDSAY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi. The Mark Twain magnet-head girl!"
"LINDSAY: The what?"
"LORELAI: You don't know the anecdote? You're the star."
"LINDSAY: The anecdote?"
"RORY: It's nothing, really. Um, it's the field trip we took to Mark Twain's house in the fourth grade, and I wanted this magnet and you lent me the money and I got the magnet."
"LORELAI: She usually tells it better."
"LINDSAY: I kinda remember."
"DEAN: So, uh, congratulations on Harvard."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, thanks."
"DEAN: I got into Southern Connecticut State."
"RORY: Oh, that's great."
"LORELAI: It is. That's great, Dean."
"RORY: You're. . .you're. . . wow."
"DEAN: Yeah, thanks."
"LINDSAY: I've gotta get home."
"DEAN: And I gotta take her, so I'll see you guys."
"LORELAI: See ya."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Dean and Lindsay walk away]"
"LORELAI: So you say she was nice?"
"RORY: Was, I guess, being the operative word. So are we going?"
"LORELAI: No, you go on ahead, I'll catch up."
"RORY: Okay. Try and make it home in time for Charlie Rose. Billy Joel's on, and he might cry or something."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Rory leaves. Luke walks over to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: So, how was Jess' Employee of the Month thing?"
"LUKE: Oh, it was okay."
"LORELAI: Just okay?"
"LUKE: There was punch."
"LORELAI: So the punch wasn't good?"
"LUKE: No, it was just. . .the manager came up afterwards when Jess was gone and he was talking about how Jess is working forty, forty-five hours a week."
"LORELAI: What? That's full time."
"LUKE: That's what I said."
"LORELAI: How does he swing it?"
"LUKE: He must be pulling double shifts on the weekends. It's all I can think of."
"LORELAI: No, he's pretty much duding it with Rory on the weekends."
"LUKE: Well, then he must be getting up super early on weekday mornings and going in."
"LORELAI: Have you ever seen him do that?"
"LUKE: No, but I don't trail him either."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but you sleep in the same room with him."
"LUKE: Oh, the manager must be getting Jess confused with somebody else."
"LORELAI: Or. . ."
"LUKE: Or what?"
"LORELAI: I don't wanna say, forget it."
"LUKE: No, say it, go ahead."
"LORELAI: Or he's working when he should be in school."
"LUKE: Impossible, no way."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: Because he knows the rules  he's gotta graduate to stay living with me. He's going, he's getting everything done, he's doing his work."
"LORELAI: You've seen this work he's doing?"
"LUKE: Not for awhile, but I just know that he is. No, no way he's cutting school, it's su1c1de, no way."
"LORELAI: I shouldn't have brought it up"
"LUKE: Ah, that's okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: Goodnight."
"[Kirk walks up to the second Poe]"
"KIRK: Say, how can I have a career as a Poe?"
"POE 2: It's not a career, this is just an event that we do. I write technical manuals for a living."
"KIRK: Yes, but how can I have a career as a Poe?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is sleeping when Rory walks in with the cordless phone]"
"RORY: Mom. Mom, wake up."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Mom, it's Tobin at the inn, something's wrong."
"LORELAI: What's wrong?"
"RORY: The fire alarm's going off."
"LORELAI: That stupid alarm. It's always doing that. Tell him if he doesn't smell smoke, to reset it, and tell him he's fired and I'm gonna kick his ass around the lobby for waking me up."
"RORY: He sounds freaked."
"LORELAI: Ugh. [takes phone] Tobin, what?. . .Oh my God. . .Okay. [hangs up] Get dressed."
"RORY: What is it?"
"LORELAI: Get dressed, get dressed."
"CUT TO FRONT OF THE INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[The inn staff and guests are all gathered out front as the fire department puts out the fire.]"
"CHIEF BAKER: [into a walkie talkie] We've got the first engine laddering the roof, first engine. Yeah, and we need PD for traffic control."
"[Lorelai and Rory rush up to the crowd]"
"SOOKIE: Ah, Lorelai, thank God."
"LORELAI: Hey, what's going on?"
"SOOKIE: This is Lorelai Gilmore."
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"CHIEF BAKER: In a minute, ma'am."
"RORY: Yeah, Mom, let him do his thing."
"LORELAI: You're right. Sookie, Michel, um, is everyone out?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"SOOKIE: Yes. We're sure, the fire department's sure, we did a head count."
"LORELAI: We need to double check, triple check. Julio! He doesn't start til six but sometimes he comes here early because his sister-in-law Rita gives him a ride on her way to work in Salisbury."
"SOOKIE: Oh! [points to Julio in the crowd]"
"LORELAI: [walks over and hugs him] Ah, Julio, Julio. Ah, I'm so glad to see you, you beautiful man."
"[The fire chief walks over to Lorelai]"
"CHIEF BAKER: Ma'am, I'm Chief Baker."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry I jumped on ya."
"CHIEF BAKER: That's okay. The good news is that this is almost out. The structure's stable, and you're probably gonna be able to get back in in about 24 hours."
"LORELAI: Excellent. Twenty-four hours, the structure's stable, thank you."
"CHIEF BAKER: That's okay."
"LORELAI: The statue of you is going up just as soon as we get back in. Eighty feet tall."
"CHIEF BAKER: I'm looking forward to it."
"LORELAI: Here we go guys, phase two."
"SOOKIE: Loving the pace here."
"LORELAI: Um, we need food, we need computers with Internet, we need phones. Michel, I need this on you stat. Hurry, hurry. Rory?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Um, help the guests with the kids, make sure they're not freaked out. Gather them up and entertain them for awhile so the adults can catch their breath."
"RORY: Right. I have never entertained kids  how do I do that?"
"LORELAI: Uh, take your socks off and do a puppet show."
"RORY: You've clearly never entertained kids either."
"LORELAI: It's all I can think of. Get cracking."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: [to the guests] Hi everybody. Good morning, and uh, whoa, talk about your change of plans here. Unfortunately, you, uh, can't get your stuff out for at least a day. However, if you wanna get home immediately, we will check planes, trains, whatever you need. We will send your stuff to you later as soon as we get it. But if you can't get home yet, we will provide everything short of anything illegal, and that's gonna start with the best breakfast of your lives. [to Sookie] Uh, Sookie, go to the market and get whatever food and supplies we need for breakfast."
"SOOKIE: Going."
"[Sookie leaves. Lorelai walks over to Michel, who is on his cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Hey, who are you on with?"
"MICHEL: The Cheshire Cat Inn."
"LORELAI: Ah, great, find people places to sleep. Excellent. [walks away]"
"MICHEL: [on phone] Yes, my name is Michel Gerard, I used to work at the Independence Inn and I was wondering if there were any positions available."
"[Lorelai walks back over and grabs the phone from him]"
"MICHEL: Phones, computer, I'm on it."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai, Sookie and the inn's guests enter]"
"SOOKIE: Morning."
"LUKE: What, what is this?"
"SOOKIE: Phase two."
"LUKE: Phase two?"
"SOOKIE: Into the back, guys. March!"
"[Sookie's cooking staff carries food and supplies into Luke's kitchen]"
"LUKE: Hold on, those guys can't go back there."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're in luck, lots of empty tables. Go on and take your seats, guys."
"LUKE: Lorelai, what is this?"
"LORELAI: We had a fire."
"LUKE: Fire, where?"
"SOOKIE: Weston's Bakery."
"LUKE: You're kidding."
"SOOKIE: They'll have fresh blueberries."
"LORELAI: Perfect. Um, Weston's, hurry."
"LUKE: Where. . .Weston's caught fire?"
"LORELAI: No, the inn."
"LUKE: Your inn?"
"SOOKIE: Just move all of Luke's stuff aside, we don't need it."
"LUKE: Hey, wait a minute."
"LORELAI: Everyone's fine, the inn's still standing, we're into phase two."
"LUKE: What is phase two?"
"SOOKIE: Just shove it aside."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"SOOKIE: Making breakfast."
"LUKE: You can't make breakfast here."
"SOOKIE: Got any plates that aren't cracked?"
"LUKE: You're the one that's cracked."
"SOOKIE: Nice thing to say to a pregnant woman."
"LUKE: You're pregnant?"
"LORELAI: Could you be any farther behind?"
"SOOKIE: Yo, Caesar, help my guys and there's a twenty in it for you."
"LUKE: We both can't be making different stuff at the same time."
"LORELAI: You know, you're right. Listen, all you people who were here before we invaded, are you willing to cancel your current orders for Sookie's famous blueberry-lemon pancakes, Belgian waffles or bananas foster?"
"MAN: Sure."
"WOMAN: Sounds good."
"SOOKIE: Okay, pull all of Luke's stuff off the grill and let's get cooking!"
"LUKE: I'm an island."
"LORELAI: Luke, I'm sorry about all this, but I'm not anticipating the inn catching fire ever again, so it's a one time only thing, okay?"
"LUKE: Like I have a choice?"
"LORELAI: You do. Say the word and we go."
"LUKE: Stay, cook, eat. I'll be upstairs."
"LORELAI: You're a doll."
"SOOKIE: No, get rid of it! Dump it, dump it! I don't wanna see it!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory is entertaining some kids by using her socks to give a puppet show. Lorelai walks over]"
"RORY: ""Where are you going? I told you to take out the garbage!"" ""Nag, nag, nag. I wanna watch football and sit in my reclining chair."" ""Get back here or I'm gonna get you. . ."" [sees Lorelai] Oh, hey, guys, hold on a second."
"BOY: No, keep going."
"RORY: Oh, calm down there, little scooter. I'll be right back."
"[Rory walks over to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Hey Shari Lewis, how's the show going?"
"RORY: Oh, they're riveted."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: Yeah, but I stink. I keep repeating the same stuff over and over again."
"LORELAI: Must be working."
"RORY: But I named them Mr. and Mrs. Sock Puppet. I put no energy into this."
"BOY: Come back, Rory."
"RORY: You would think that a lame-o sock puppet show would bore them to tears."
"LORELAI: It's your narrative k*ll. I mean, is he gonna take the garbage out, is he not gonna take the garbage out? I'm on the edge of my seat."
"RORY: Yeah, but they won't let me stop and I have to get to school eventually."
"LORELAI: Okay. [to kids] Hey, guys, go on over to the diner and have breakfast with your families, and then ask the nice man in the baseball hat and the flannel shirt to do sock puppets for you. And if he says no, just ask him louder  it's part of the game!"
"BOY: Oh boy!"
"LORELAI: Go!"
"[the kids run toward the diner]"
"RORY: You're cruel and they love you."
"LORELAI: Come check in at Patty's with me."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO"
"[A table has been set up with a computer, phone, and other supplies as the temporary inn headquarters. Michel, Babette, and Miss Patty are at the table.]"
"BABETTE: I love computers, I just know nothing about them. What does pushing that F3 button do?"
"MICHEL: Annoy me to no end."
"BABETTE: What about the F4?"
"[the phone rings]"
"MISS PATTY: [answers] Hello, this is the Independence Inn emergency headquarters. I'm Miss patty, I'll be assisting you today. How may I help you? [pause] The printer will be here in half an hour, I'll let him know. Thank you. Goodbye. [hangs up] The printer will "
"MICHEL: I heard, and you've got to shorten your greeting."
"MISS PATTY: What?"
"MICHEL: You do not need to recite the Gettysburg Address every time you answer the phone."
"MISS PATTY: I was Ricardo Montalban's receptionist for six months and he never complained."
"MICHEL: Who?"
"MISS PATTY: Don't make me hit you."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: You all set up here?"
"MICHEL: Computer with Internet, phones forwarded here, printer on the way."
"MISS PATTY: I'm the receptionist."
"BABETTE: And I'm learning the computer."
"MICHEL: And I'm looking for my cyanide capsule  have you seen it?"
"LORELAI: It's nice of you to help guys, thanks. Now, at least half the Poe group needs to stay another night, so we're gonna need to find places to put them up."
"MICHEL: Everything is booked."
"LORELAI: You checked the Cheshire Cat, the Maiden's Teacup, the Cookie House, the Sugarbear Inn?"
"MICHEL: Every place that sounds like Glinda the Good Witch threw up, yes  all booked."
"LORELAI: Well, then, we're gonna have to take people in."
"MISS PATTY: Well, I can take a couple in, sweetie."
"BABETTE: I can, too. We got cots. Ooh-hoo-hoo, we got cots."
"LORELAI: Great. Michel?"
"MICHEL: Forget it. The Poes are weird. I'd fear being k*ll in my sleep. Plus, I don't like strangers using my toilet."
"BABETTE: I bet the Kims could put people up. And Taylor. And Al."
"LORELAI: And we've got our couch and my room."
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: They can have my room, not yours."
"LORELAI: No, hon, mine's fine."
"RORY: Mom, no, mine. You are stressed out enough without losing your room. You need your rest, so you keep your bed, period."
"LORELAI: I'll look selfish."
"RORY: Well, if anyone calls you that, I'll kick their sorry butts."
"LORELAI: Okay, your room under protest."
"BABETTE: Hey Michel, I just hit F4 and the num lock key and the one with the little apple on it and it's freaking out like it's on acid or something."
"MICHEL: Oy vey."
"[phone rings]"
"MISS PATTY: I got it. [answers] Yeah?"
"MICHEL: Well, you need to say more than that."
"MISS PATTY: Well, make up your mind."
"RORY: I've gotta go, but page me if there's any news or anything."
"LORELAI: Okay. You mean, like if Michel k*ll Babette and then Patty then himself in a bizarre m*rder pact?"
"RORY: Amongst other things."
"[they hug]"
"LORELAI: We had a fire."
"RORY: I know. Bye."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"MRS. O'MALLEY: It'll be the last midterm of your high school careers, so rejoice over that if nothing else. [bell rings] Now, before you go, I just wanna mention that it looks like another banner year for Chilton grads seeking top colleges. I wanna congratulate all of those who have heard and advise patience for all of you who have not. No one has escaped from Chilton without going onto another terrific school if that is his or her goal."
"LOUISE: Good to hear."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: And I know that at least one of you has been accepted to Harvard. It's an immense honor, that. Congratulations."
"[students start to leave]"
"RORY: Have you guys heard from Paris?"
"MADELINE: Heard what?"
"RORY: Anything?"
"LOUISE: She's not here?"
"RORY: She's been gone for five days."
"LOUISE: Huh."
"MADELINE: Didn't notice."
"LOUISE: Although, it did seem like there was a lot more air in here."

"CUT TO PARIS' BEDROOM"
"[Paris is in bed watching television. There's a knock at the door. She ignores it, and there's a second knock]"
"PARIS: Come back for the tray later, Nanny."
"RORY: It's not Nanny, Paris. It's Rory. Can I come in?"
"PARIS: I guess."
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hi. I brought a bunch of school stuff from the past few days. If there's anything missing, I can bring it over later."
"PARIS: Thank you. No offense, but my soap's starting."
"RORY: So, you're sick, huh?"
"PARIS: You know what's wrong. You of all people. That's Martin. His sister-in-law got kidnapped and he thinks his former lover is behind it."
"RORY: Juicy."
"PARIS: So, don't you have an announcement?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"PARIS: Did you get in?"
"RORY: You know, we don't have to. . ."
"PARIS: I know you did. You've got that Harvard glow about you, the glow of destiny."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Just tell me."
"RORY: I got in."
"PARIS: Ugh, Amanda and Richard. I'm so over them."
"RORY: So you've been incommunicado lately."
"PARIS: I've had Nanny hold all my calls, and the mail. My parents are away, so I've been totally Howard Hughes-ing it."
"RORY: So did you tell them about Harvard?"
"PARIS: No."
"RORY: Don't you think you should?"
"PARIS: No."
"RORY: Well, don't you think they'll find out?"
"PARIS: How?"
"RORY: Well, you not moving out might be a tip-off."
"PARIS: I'll get an apartment in Cambridge, buy a Harvard sweatshirt, talk about Mira Sorvino a lot. It's doable. I did tell my mother about having sex with Jamie, and her only reaction was to talk about how my father hasn't pleased her in fifteen years."
"RORY: Yikes."
"PARIS: Like I couldn't tell."
"RORY: And what's going on with your boyfriend?"
"PARIS: I haven't called him either."
"RORY: So the only people in your life right now work at General Hospital?"
"PARIS: This isn't General Hospital. I don't deserve General Hospital."
"RORY: Okay, you've got to stop doing this."
"PARIS: What happened? Harvard was my destiny. I was flipping through Harvard class schedules when you were still delighting to The Adventures of Gumby and Pokie."
"RORY: I was more of a Pee Wee Herman kind of gal."
"PARIS: It's partly my parents' fault, they didn't brand me properly. I should've been at the 92nd Street Y or Brick Church."
"RORY: Prep schools?"
"PARIS: Pre-schools. It decides everything. But I'm not totally blameless. I found a spot in my interview that I'm sure doomed me."
"RORY: You recorded your Harvard interview?"
"PARIS: The plan was to archive everything, then donate it to the university upon my demise. Little did I expect that my demise would come this early."
"[she presses play on a handheld tape recorder]"
"Paris: . . .shouldn't even be taken into account. This dovetails nicely into my feelings about population control. It's a little hot in here, can we do something about that? Anyway, population control has been dramatically successful in most European countries to the detriment of some, especially Italy, which is experiencing a marked drop "
"Interviewer: Do you think this has anything to do with "
"Paris: Whoa, whoa, just let me finish my thought here."
"Interviewer: But Paris. . ."
"Paris: Please!"
"[Paris stops the tape recorder]"
"RORY: Well, you said please, that's very polite."
"PARIS: I sound like a meth addict. I might as well record the new Justin Timberlake over this."
"RORY: I hate that you're torturing yourself like this, in bed like this."
"PARIS: Proust wrote all three thousand pages of In Search of Lost Time in bed. If it's good enough for him. [Rory grabs the remote and turns the TV off] Hey!"
"RORY: Bed is not a life plan, and you, my friend, need a life plan, so here it is. You need to tell your parents about Harvard. You need to start taking calls from people. You need to check the mail so that you can see the other millions of universities that have no doubt accepted you and that are probably dying to be in the Paris Gellar business. You need to call your boyfriend back because he's going to be worried about you and because none of this is his fault, and you need to start by getting the hell out of bed."
"PARIS: You did not just say ""be in the Paris Gellar business."""
"RORY: You know what I meant."
"PARIS: There is no alternative to Harvard."
"RORY: Except Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Stanford, Sarah Lawrence, et cetera, et cetera."
"PARIS: Well, maybe you're right."
"RORY: I'm unquestionably right."
"PARIS: But I'm not jumping up this second."
"RORY: You don't have to rush it."
"PARIS: And I'm going to have to keep watching this, at least until Adriana's wrongful conviction for aggravated as*ault is overturned."
"RORY: I understand."
"PARIS: Thanks."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks to the living room, where a little boy is on the couch]"
"LORELAI: You've got your remote, your water, your comic books. Looks like we've got you all set up here, Fred Junior."
"FRED JR: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Oh, ma'am. You make me feel old. Stop it."
"FRED JR: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: No, I mean it, stop it."
"FRED JR: Okay."
"[Fred walks down the staircase]"
"FRED: I think we're out of toothpaste."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry, Fred. Below the sink there's plenty more."
"FRED: Oh, thank you. This is kind of fun."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it's fun having you guys."
"[Lorelai walks to Rory's room, where Rory's making the bed]"
"LORELAI: Aw, I would've done that."
"RORY: I feel weird now."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: About other people sleeping in my bed."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, don't worry. Fred and his wife don't seem. . ."
"RORY: Don't seem what?"
"LORELAI: Like they're feeling extremely romantic."
"RORY: Oh, God, that didn't even cross my mind."
"LORELAI: You're kidding! That's all I would've thought of."
"RORY: Well, I'm thinking about it now, thank you very much."
"LORELAI: Got all your stuff for Lane's?"
"RORY: Yeah, it wasn't a hard packing job."
"[Lorelai glances at some of Rory's papers]"
"LORELAI: Wow, these have really changed."
"RORY: What have?"
"LORELAI: The pro/con lists. In all the hubbub, they slipped my mind. Yale."
"RORY: What about it?"
"LORELAI: Yale."
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: Yale."
"RORY: Stop saying Yale."
"LORELAI: It has double the pros of the other two."
"RORY: I wouldn't say double."
"LORELAI: Triple over filthy, dirty Princeton. It's kicking butt."
"RORY: But I'm not done collecting my data yet."
"LORELAI: You have a document the length of Nicholas Nickleby here. Looks like you're done."
"RORY: But. . ."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Look at my wall."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: So that wall says something."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it says the Harvard merchandising department made a nice chunk of change off of us."
"RORY: But how can I go to Yale with my wall looking like this?"
"LORELAI: It's a wall. Look, honey, Luke was right. The pro/con lists have to come to an end eventually."
"RORY: But Luke also reminded us that it was supposed to be Harvard regardless of a list. Everyone thinks that."
"LORELAI: I don't. I don't. I know I'm the one who said no to Yale loudly and a lot, but not anymore. Really, I just want what's right."
"RORY: I know, but it has to be right for both of us."
"LORELAI: If it's right for you, it's really right for me."
"RORY: But I don't want you to hate the place I'm going."
"LORELAI: Never."
"[Fred and his wife come to the doorway]"
"FRED: Oh. Uh, are you not ready for us yet?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, we're ready for you, Fred."
"FRED: We hate to put you out."
"RORY: No, it's perfectly okay."
"LORELAI: I'm guessing you two are gonna fall sound asleep the minute your heads hit that pillow."
"FRED: Oh yeah, we're exhausted."
"RORY: Have a good night."
"LORELAI: Yeah, guys, yell if you need anything. [quietly] I don't wanna hear you yelling for any other reason."
"RORY: Shh!"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Ah. So where's Jess tonight?"
"RORY: Working."
"LORELAI: He works a lot, doesn't he?"
"RORY: He's saving a lot, too."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: He wants a better car. The one he's got keeps stalling."
"LORELAI: And he's still working at Luke's, too, right?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: So is he down to part-time at school?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: Getting work credit or something?"
"RORY: No, he's going full time."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Why do you say that?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It's just, Wal-Mart, working at Luke's, squiring you around town. . .it just seems like a lot of his time's accounted for."
"RORY: Well, that's crazy. He's a senior, he's going to school full time."
"LORELAI: Just wondering."
"RORY: Rest."
"LORELAI: I'll try."
"RORY: And don't start the sock puppets with Fred Junior or he'll never let you stop. Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[As Rory walks out the back door, the doorbell rings; Lorelai walks toward the front door]"
"LORELAI: Excitement here never stops, Fred Junior."
"[Lorelai pulls open the door]"
"MR. HATLESTAD: Hi there."
"LORELAI: The Hatlestads, hi. I thought you went home."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Well, breakfast was so great and the town's so nice, and you made staying over sound so fun, that we decided to take you up on it."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Is that okay?"
"LORELAI: It's more than okay. Come on in, cause you're staying here."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Thank you. [they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Your bedroom's right upstairs, you can't miss it."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Terrific, thanks. [they start walking up the stairs]"
"LORELAI: How much room you take up on that couch there, Fred Junior?"
"FRED JR: Pretty much all of it."
"LORELAI: That's what I figured."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Rory and Lane are making up their cots in the store area]"
"RORY: So, who do you have staying in your room?"
"LANE: The second Poe and his wife."
"RORY: Well, for your sake, I hope they are very, very tired."
"LANE: Why?"
"[cell phone rings]"
"RORY: Nothing. I shouldn't have said anything. [answers phone] Hello?"
"LORELAI: I'm a nomad."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I am the lonely wanderer. Hank Williams would be too sad to write a song about me."
"RORY: Where are you?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm a Bedouin. I'm homeless!"
"RORY: Okay, stop with that. Where are you?"
"LORELAI: I'm walking aimlessly around town."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: The Hatlestads showed up."
"RORY: But they went home."
"LORELAI: Apparently I made the whole emergency fire accommodations sound so fun that they had second thoughts."
"RORY: You're a terrific salesman."
"LORELAI: And a terrific idiot."
"RORY: So where are you right this second?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm in the middle of the street, a.k.a. my bedroom."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I'm by the school, Luke's, that area."
"RORY: Luke's, good. Go there."
"LORELAI: It's closed."
"RORY: But Luke is upstairs."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: Ask him if you can stay."
"LORELAI: But "
"RORY: I bet the answer's yes."
"LORELAI: He'll make me eat a veggie burger!"
"RORY: Get moving."
"LORELAI: Fine. Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"[they hang up. Lorelai walks up to the diner and bangs on the door]"
"LORELAI: [yells] Luke! Luke! Stella!"
"[She throws a rock at his apartment window. Luke opens it and leans out]"
"LUKE: Who is that?"
"LORELAI: Lorelai."
"LUKE: What are you doing down there?"
"LORELAI: Enjoying some air, getting some exercise, and freezing."
"LUKE: Well, go home."
"LORELAI: Home? I have no home. Hunted, despised."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's from Ed Wood, the movie."
"LUKE: Have you gone bonkers?"
"LORELAI: People are bunking at my place and I need somewhere to stay."
"LUKE: And it just occurred to you now to look for a place?"
"LORELAI: The stupid Hatlestads showed up."
"LUKE: Who?"
"[A women leans out a nearby window]"
"MRS. SLUTSKY: Pipe down out there!"
"LUKE: Go back to bed, Mrs. Slutsky!"
"MRS. SLUTSKY: Don't talk to me that way, young man!"
"LORELAI: Throw your keys down."
"MRS. SLUTSKY: I will not!"
"LORELAI: No, Luke, Mrs. Slutsky."
"LUKE: I'll just come down."
"MRS. SLUTSKY: Do something!"
"LORELAI: Ditto."
"LUKE: I'm coming down."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Luke leaves the window. Lorelai and Mrs. Slutsky stare at each other]"
"LORELAI: My  my inn caught fire. [pause] Hurry, Luke."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Rory and Lane are sitting in their cots. Lane is on the phone]"
"LANE: No, Young Chui, it was right to break up with her. Why stay in a relationship when it's not going anywhere? . . .Life's too short, exactly. . . .No, I told you a joke last night, I need more time to come up with another one. . . Look, it's getting late. I got my math test tomorrow, I better go. . .Yeah, I'll call you to tell you how it went. . . Okay, night. [hangs up]"
"RORY: So Young Chui and his girlfriend are broken up, huh?"
"LANE: Yeah, and good riddance. She was very waspy."
"RORY: What about you and Young Chui? Are you broken up?"
"LANE: No, my mom still thinks we're the perfect young Korean couple."
"RORY: Weren't you supposed to be broken up by now?"
"LANE: Yeah, but Young Chui thinks it isn't time yet."
"RORY: Why? This is a fake relationship. You were never really going out."
"LANE: I don't know. I bring it up every night and he just changes the subject."
"RORY: You talk every night?"
"LANE: Pretty much. He's a little needy right now."
"RORY: That's a lot of talking."
"LANE: Well, we're friends."
"RORY: Just friends?"
"LANE: What are you getting at?"
"RORY: Just that he's calling you every night and he keeps putting off your break-up, so God knows when you'll be able to date Dave Rygalski. He's asking you to tell him jokes and to let him know how your math test went. . ."
"LANE: So?"
"RORY: So. . . it sounds like he's in love with you."
"LANE: No. No. Young Chui is not in love with me. And it's not for you to take an innocent friendship like Young Chui and I have, with its air of innocence and its. . .innocence. Oh my God, he loves me. That stupid boy's fallen in love with me!"
"RORY: It's not stupid. You're a catch."
"LANE: But not his catch, I'm Dave's catch. I've already been caught."
"RORY: You probably need to be more direct."
"LANE: That fool. And I can't break up with him or my mom will never let me date. It's gotta come from him. What do I do?"
"[Jess knocks on the window]"
"RORY: Just a second? [she walks over to the window and opens it]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Bizarro day, huh?"
"RORY: Wouldn't wanna repeat it."
"JESS: The inn's still closed?"
"RORY: Just til tomorrow."
"JESS: What caused it?"
"RORY: They're not sure. Something electrical, probably."
"JESS: That's usually the culprit. Something the matter?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Good."
"RORY: So how was school?"
"JESS: Same ol', same ol'."
"RORY: You're still doing okay?"
"JESS: Doing my reading, writing, and arithmetic."
"RORY: And you're still going, right?"
"JESS: What? Where's this coming from?"
"RORY: There's been speculation."
"JESS: From who?"
"RORY: My mom asked whether you're going full time to school."
"JESS: Your mom?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Why's she so interested?"
"RORY: Because you're dating her daughter."
"JESS: Oh, great, what else does she think I did? Start the fire, put Phil Spector up to it?"
"RORY: I told her yes, you were going."
"JESS: Well, as they say on the Family Feud, good answer."
"RORY: So, I didn't lie to her?"
"JESS: No."
"RORY: No?"
"JESS: Look, don't worry, I got it under control."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: I'm going enough. I've been picking up some extra shifts here and there, but I'm fine. It's Mickey Mouse stuff anyway. What it takes the others hours to learn, it takes me minutes."
"RORY: Well, if you're behind. . ."
"JESS: I'm not behind."
"RORY: But if you get behind, I can help you catch up."
"JESS: Got it covered."
"RORY: If you say so."
"JESS: I do."
"RORY: Okay."
"JESS: So how bout you come out?"
"[Mrs. Kim walks into the room holding a bat]"
"MRS. KIM: What's this?"
"LANE: He was just leaving, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: Why is he here at all?"
"LANE: He came to borrow something. Here. [she picks up something from the table and walks it over to Jess]"
"JESS: Thank you. [to Mrs. Kim] Baseball bat?"
"MRS. KIM: Cricket."
"JESS: Night."
"[Jess leaves, Mrs. Kim locks the window]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Lorelai and Luke are making up the bed.]"
"LUKE: Oh, don't do that."
"LORELAI: Don't do what?"
"LUKE: Don't pull the sheet back after I pull it. I need more for this side."
"[they continue making the bed]"
"LUKE: You pulled it back again."
"LORELAI: Okay, I need it for my side."
"LUKE: I need it to tuck in."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"LUKE: I always tuck it in on this side."
"LORELAI: Let's tuck it in on both sides."
"LUKE: You tuck a bed in on both sides?"
"LORELAI: Yes, and then I slip down into it like I'm in a straitjacket or something."
"LUKE: Oh, you must feel right at home there."
"LORELAI: I so set you up for that."
"LUKE: Fine, tuck it in on your side."
"[Luke walks toward the couch]"
"LORELAI: You know, I really should take the couch. Me taking the bed doesn't feel right."
"LUKE: Oh, now, come on."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You b*at me into giving you the bed and pretending you don't want it now isn't working."
"LORELAI: I'm pretending to try to be polite."
"LUKE: I'm fine with the couch. You're the one that's exhausted."
"LORELAI: You know, I'm actually not."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: I'm, like, strangely exhilarated. I mean, as awful as what happened today was, I'm happy with how I handled it. You know, you never know how you're gonna react in situations like this until something happens and I think I did pretty well."
"LUKE: Yeah, I do, too."
"[the phone rings.]"
"LUKE: [answers] Hello? . . .oh, hey, Nicole, hi. . .Yeah, I'm good. . . Oh, not much. There was a fire at the local inn out here and. . .Yeah, the one she works at, yeah. . .Everybody's fine. Yeah, just a lot of chaos for awhile. So how was your thing today? . . . All right, fill me in tomorrow. . . Seven's good. . .Okay. . . Okay, yeah. . .Goodnight. [hangs up] That was Nicole."
"LORELAI: So I heard. Why didn't you tell her I was here?"
"LUKE: Didn't come up."
"LORELAI: You mean, she didn't out of the clear blue and for no reason ask you if I was sleeping over?"
"LUKE: Just didn't seem necessary."
"LORELAI: Well, you have nothing to hide here. You just took in a refugee."
"LUKE: I know there's nothing to hide. It's just that. . .you've kinda become a. . ."
"LORELAI: Become what?"
"LUKE: A sore point with me and Nicole."
"LORELAI: What, how?"
"LUKE: Well, on our first date, I was a little nervous and I wasn't having any luck coming up with topics, so I was just kinda blabbing a lot. And then she ordered extra fries at dinner, so it reminded me of you and I told her a quick story about you and French fries, and that seemed fine. And then later, she ordered a third cup of coffee. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: And I mentioned you and your coffee thing, and I noticed that Nicole kind of reacted a little, and ever since then, she's been a little sensitive to the issue."
"LORELAI: Well, of course she is, Luke. You don't talk about another woman on a first date."
"LUKE: Even if it's just a friend?"
"LORELAI: They don't exist."
"LUKE: Come on."
"LORELAI: Not on a first date."
"LUKE: No other women exist on a first date, not even my mother?"
"LORELAI: Do you really think talking about your mother on a first date is wise?"
"LUKE: Not really."
"LORELAI: You can maybe mention a sister, maybe. And then you move on really, really quickly."
"LUKE: This is why I hate dating."
"LORELAI: Well, unless you wanna be Mountain Man all your life, you've got to abide by the rules and customs. Ooh, sorry, I have to get up super early tomorrow."
"LUKE: No problem. What time?"
"LORELAI: Six."
"LUKE: I get up at quarter to five every morning."
"LORELAI: Why in the world would you get up that early?"
"LUKE: I don't know, to run my business?"
"LORELAI: Well, change businesses. Ooh, wow, total déjà vu."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: It's the alarm clock. I had a dream once that you set eighteen alarm clocks to get me up, which is not a bad way to get me up."
"LUKE: Where were we?"
"LORELAI: We were, um, at my house. I got up, I went downstairs for coffee, and you talked to my stomach."
"LUKE: Why on earth I do that?"
"LORELAI: Well, because I was pregnant. Twins."
"LUKE: Mine?"
"LORELAI: What am I, dream tramp? Of course yours."
"LUKE: We were married?"
"LORELAI: Um, yeah. Did I not mention that?"
"LUKE: No. You know, you shouldn't drink coffee when you're pregnant."
"LORELAI: Uh, true."
"LUKE: It's probably why Rory's a caffeine addict."
"LORELAI: Right, you're right."
"LUKE: Dream go beyond that?"
"LORELAI: No. Um, you talked to my stomach and then you ki. . .well, no."
"LUKE: Oh, okay. Well. . .night."
"LORELAI: Yeah, night."
"CUT TO LATER THAT NIGHT"
"[Luke and Jess are snoring loudly. Lorelai has trouble sleeping, so she gets up and leaves]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory gets some coffee from the counter and sits down at a table with Lorelai]"
"RORY: Luke and Sookie have worked things out."
"LORELAI: There does seem to be a grudging respect thing going on."
"SOOKIE: Get the ricotta fritters started, guys. I wanna serve those first."
"LUKE: Hey, we making the Cajun Eggs Benedict again?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know, we could."
"LUKE: Let's do it, it was good."
"SOOKIE: Well, the Cajun was all your doing."
"LUKE: Only because I knocked the cayenne pepper into your hollandaise."
"SOOKIE: Hey, how do you think they invented the Reese's cup and penicillin, my friend? We can win the Nobel here."
"[Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"JESS: Morning."
"LUKE: You're up early."
"JESS: Gotta catch me that worm. See ya."
"LUKE: Where you off to?"
"JESS: School."
"LUKE: This early?"
"JESS: I got a lab project going on. Me and my team are meeting early."
"LUKE: Well, have a good day."
"JESS: If I have a choice. [walks over to Rory and Lorelai] Hey."
"LORELAI: Good morning."
"JESS: Talk to you later."
"RORY: Later."
"[Jess leaves; Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: By the way, your boyfriend snores."
"RORY: Didn't need to know that."
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello. . .it is?. . .oh, I love you, I love you. . .thanks. [hangs up] We're open. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please. That was just Chief Baker on the phone who told me in that deep sexy voice of his that the inn is officially reopened. Uh, right now it's just me and the staffers, but soon, very soon, you will have your stuff back and you can go home."
"FRED: Thank you, Lorelai. Listen, from our group, we want to give you this. [hands her a stuffed raven]"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, that's the nicest dead bird I've ever gotten. Thanks, Fred."
"POE 2: It's from all of us."
"LORELAI: Right. Thank you Poe Society. Coming Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: I'm coming. Okay, you need to caramelize the hazelnuts for the brioche French toast, add some Madeira to the pear-poaching liquid and add some chives to the cream for the sheared eggs."
"LUKE: Don't burn anything, got it."
"RORY: I've gotta change for school."
"LORELAI: Go, go, we'll see you later."
"SOOKIE: Let's go."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel and Chief Baker are waiting on the porch as Lorelai and Sookie walk up]"
"MICHEL: Ah, here they are."
"LORELAI: Hi, Michel. Hi, Chief. Don't we love our chief?"
"SOOKIE: I bet he can b*at up all the other chiefs."
"LORELAI: For sure he can."
"MICHEL: Can we get on with this?"
"CHIEF BAKER: Let me just unlock the door here."
"LORELAI: Michel, the first thing I wanna do is get into all the rooms and get all the guests' stuff into the lobby and organized for them to pick up. Sookie, go to the kitchen and let me know what's what. Maybe we can open for dinner."
"CHIEF BAKER: Dinner?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"CHIEF BAKER: Anyone give you a heads up about what's inside?"
"LORELAI: No."
"CHIEF BAKER: You might wanna wait til you get inside to make your plans. And go slow."
"[Lorelai, Sookie and Michel enter the inn and survey the fire damage in the lobby. Meanwhile at Lorelai's house, Rory enters to find the Harvard paraphernalia on her bedroom walls has been replaced with Yale paraphernalia.]"

"EMILY: Richard, please, we are starving!"
"RICHARD: [calls from kitchen] I will be right there, Emily."
"EMILY: This is ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Mom, relax."
"EMILY: He woke up this morning and suddenly just had to have this dish that his grandmother would make him."

"RORY: He's having fun, Grandma."
"EMILY: I saw an open can of cream of mushroom soup. Nothing good can come of that."
"[Richard walks in carrying a casserole dish]"
"RICHARD: Here we are, a treat for the masses."
"RORY: Smells good."
"RICHARD: Oh, this is my favorite thing to eat as a boy. My gran used to make this for me whenever I was feeling a little sad. You know, if my cricket team lost or a girl I fancied turned up her nose at me."
"LORELAI: Well, then load me up because there was this really cute chick at the pharmacy today. I used my best material on her and nothing."
"EMILY: Richard, at least let Pina serve it."
"LORELAI: No comment on my lesbian hilarity. My, how far we've come."
"RICHARD: Pina will serve tiny, proper servings. Johnny Machete needs to be presented in a heap."
"RORY: Johnny Machete?"
"EMILY: That's the name of this vile concoction."
"RORY: It's delicious."
"LORELAI: It's not bad."
"EMILY: It's twelve different colors."
"LORELAI: Come on, Mom, eat it."
"EMILY: It looks like someone already did."
"RICHARD: Emily."
"EMILY: I'm sorry. I'm happy you're happy, and to prove it, I will take exactly three bites of this before I throw it out."
"RICHARD: Thank you."
"EMILY: You're welcome."
"RICHARD: So, good food, good company. Now, let's move onto good conversation. Rory, what is new in your life?"
"RORY: Well, funny you should mention it. . ."
"LORELAI: Now?"
"RORY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Okay. Mom, Dad, we have some really big news."
"RORY: I got my college acceptance letters back."
"LORELAI: Harvard, Princeton, and Yale."
"RORY: And after giving it a lot of thought, I have decided. I'm going to Yale."
"LORELAI: Did you hear that  Yale!"
"RORY: I'm going to Yale!"
"LORELAI: That's where you went, Dad."
"RORY: You liked it, remember?"
"EMILY: Pass the Johnny Machete, please."
"LORELAI: Pass the. . ."
"RORY: I don't understand. I thought you wanted me to go to Yale."
"EMILY: No, we didn't."
"RICHARD: Absolutely not."
"EMILY: What gave you that idea?"
"LORELAI: Mom, Dad, look, I know we've had our differences over where Rory should go to school, but that's behind us now. She's going to Yale, and that's good. Really good."
"RORY: Nothing but smiles."
"LORELAI: We're both very happy about it."
"RORY: Both."
"LORELAI: Her and me."
"RORY: She and I."
"LORELAI: Everybody in this room named Lorelai is over the moon about the going to Yale.'"
"RORY: Which means that everybody else in this room not named Lorelai can be equally over the moon about the going to Yale.'"
"RICHARD: I'm getting the champagne."
"EMILY: I'm calling the Talbotts."
"RICHARD: Oh, make sure you gloat over that dimwitted son of theirs who couldn't even get into Brown."
"EMILY: She's going to Yale!"
"RICHARD: She's going to Yale!"
"[they start to walk away, then both turn back to kiss Rory]"
"RICHARD: When I get back, I'll teach you the fight song."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is in the lobby talking with the construction worker]"
"LORELAI: So?"
"TOM: It looks b*rned."
"LORELAI: Thank you. How long to make it not looked b*rned?"
"TOM: Uh, geez, maybe two "
"LORELAI: Tom, let me help you out. The answer I'm looking for is ten days because that's when I have to get guests back in here again."
"TOM: Okay, ten days."
"LORELAI: Are you lying to me?"
"TOM: What's the answer you're looking for there?"
"LORELAI: Never mind, just go fast."
"TOM: Go fast, huh? Never heard that one before."
"[Sookie walks over]"
"SOOKIE: Well, everything's fine in the kitchen. We just have to get the gas line reconnected."
"LORELAI: How long's that gonna take?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. The plumber's in there now looking at everything."
"[Michel walks over]"
"MICHEL: We forgot to call the Rappaports and they showed up."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, what did you do?"
"MICHEL: Well, luckily they are not too bright so I convinced them they got their days mixed up and I sent them home."
"LORELAI: You sent them home? You didn't even try to get them a room somewhere else?"
"MICHEL: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: [to worker] Hey Laura, try to track down the Rappaports and see if you can get them into the Bunnyhop Inn. Thanks. [to Michel and Sookie] Okay, grab a seat and let's get the meeting started."
"[a man walks into the lobby]"
"TOBIN: I'm here, I brought bagels."
"LORELAI: Oh, Tobin, great. I'm starving."
"TOBIN: Normally I wouldn't think of it, because what bagel stands a chance next to Sookie's magical muffins and scones?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, Tobin, stop!"
"TOBIN: Two full pants sizes, my friend, all because of you."
"MICHEL: What is he doing here? He is the night manager  it's day."
"LORELAI: Michel, this is an emergency staff meeting, I need him here."
"MICHEL: I told you I cannot be in the same room with him."
"LORELAI: It's an hour out of your life, deal with it."
"TOBIN: Hold it. In case of soot. [spreads a handkerchief on the seat of Lorelai's chair]"
"LORELAI: You're very sweet."
"TOBIN: Wait, wait. [wipes off the back of Lorelai's chair] Let's let the dry cleaners drum up their own business, huh?"
"[Tobin starts to sit down]"
"MICHEL: My chair!"
"TOBIN: Oh, I'm sorry. [sits in another chair]"
"[Michel sits down and scoots his chair close to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so, should we get a room or what?"
"MICHEL: Will you just start your meeting?"
"LORELAI: All right. Here's the situation."
"TOBIN: Excuse me, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"TOBIN: Michel, did you get a bagel?"
"MICHEL: I don't want a bagel."
"TOBIN: Are you sure? They're Kosher."
"MICHEL: I don't eat bagels. Bagels are like glue in your intestines and ensure that everything that enters your body will remain there until you die."
"SOOKIE: Ew, shut up."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's focus. As you know, the fire pretty much wiped out the dining room and five of the upstairs rooms."
"[Tobin sighs]"
"LORELAI: Tobin, are you okay?"
"TOBIN: I'm sorry, I just. . .I just love this place so much. I've been the night manager here for five years and I've spent so much time walking these halls, listening for friendly ghosts flying around, playing "
"MICHEL: Make a point, bagel boy."
"TOBIN: It just hurts me to see it wounded, that's all."
"LORELAI: Well, it won't be wounded forever. We will rebuild and we'll be back and better than ever. We just need to keep it going until then. So I need some ideas on what to do."
"TOBIN: You know, I was thinking. . .I'm sorry, may I?"
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: Go ahead."
"TOBIN: Well, if we could get a celebrity in here, that would generate a lot of publicity."
"LORELAI: Hm. But how could we get a celebrity in here?"
"TOBIN: I know Tony Randall and Renee Estevez. I'd be happy to put in a call."
"MICHEL: Okay. Look, I hate to bring this up, especially since  I mean, how do you top Renee Estevez? But we have a small number of rooms, yes?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"MICHEL: And the lobby's fine, and Sookie can make certain things at home  muffins, baked goods, jams, et cetera."
"LORELAI: So?"
"MICHEL: So that's breakfast, and we have beds, and if we add some free wine and cheese around five in the afternoon. . ."
"LORELAI: Uh, no. We're not becoming a bed and breakfast. Who's next?"
"MICHEL: You're being stubborn."
"LORELAI: Bed and breakfasts are cutesy and annoying."
"SOOKIE: It forces people to mingle."
"LORELAI: I do not support the mingling."
"MICHEL: Adding a little gimmick will be an incentive for people to keep their reservations."
"TOBIN: You know what, I hate to say it, not being a B&B man myself, but Michel is making sense."
"MICHEL: Get off my side immediately."
"LORELAI: All right, I'll consider it."
"MICHEL: Sure, if he says it, you will consider it."
"[Tom walks over]"
"TOM: I gotta show you something."
"LORELAI: Is it bad?"
"TOM: No, it's great. You're gonna be thrilled, really. Warm up, cartwheels are coming."
"LORELAI: Keep talking. Be right back."
"[Lorelai starts following Tom. Tobin walks up to her]"
"TOBIN: Excuse me, Lorelai? Listen, I know you're crazed right now, but I also remembered that your birthday is coming up on Friday, and well, I got you a little something."
"LORELAI: Oh, you didn't have to do that."
"TOBIN: It's very small."
"LORELAI: Tobin, I love candles."
"TOBIN: And it's scented, cappuccino."
"LORELAI: God, that smells great."
"TOBIN: I'm really glad you like it."
"LORELAI: I do, thanks."
"TOBIN: And listen, I'm the night manager here and I'm very proud to be the night manager, but with everything so wacky crazy around here right now, if you need some extra help during the day, please call me."
"LORELAI: I may take you up on that offer, Tobin. Thanks."
"[Lorelai walks away. Michel and Tobin share a look]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the stairs into the living room]"
"LORELAI: Stairs squeak."
"RORY: Stairs squeak."
"LORELAI: There's a chip on the banister."
"RORY: Chip on the banister."
"LORELAI: The paint's chipped in the archway, and there's a board loose in the entryway. Ooh, and the chimney needs to be swept."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Luke cannot sweep our chimney."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"RORY: Because you need to be a chimney sweep to sweep a chimney."
"LORELAI: Please. If Dick van d*ke can do it, so can Luke."
"RORY: Luke is going to be very sorry he ever made this offer to you."
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke has given me five free hours of handyman work for my birthday for the last five years."
"RORY: And you have grossly exploited that gift every year for the past four years."
"LORELAI: Well, I need to make up for that first year where I didn't milk it like I should've."
"RORY: The spirit of giving is completely lost on you."
"LORELAI: But the spirit of getting is alive and well and it wants its chimney swept. Ooh, put down laundry, too."
"RORY: Fine, then can he also build me another bookshelf?"
"LORELAI: I've never been prouder of you than I am right at this moment."
"[the phone rings]"
"RORY: And tell him to paint little flowers on it."
"LORELAI: Cause he's so good with the florals."
"[Lorelai walks toward the kitchen as Rory answers the phone]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"PARIS: I finished the paper on Dickinson, the Physics test was for a third grader, and I picked the history of the Egyptian political process as my International History project."
"RORY: You've been very busy."
"PARIS: I've been very bored."
"RORY: When are you coming back to school?"
"PARIS: My parents return tomorrow. I think my mom's bringing home a new face."
"RORY: Really?"
"PARIS: There's a doctor in France who injects some kind of gel into your head and then molds it to give you better cheekbones."
"RORY: You are kidding me."
"PARIS: She has to sleep on her back for a month, otherwise her face will flatten like a crepe."
"RORY: Oh my God, it's Brazil."
"PARIS: Anyway, I'll probably have to go back to school when they get home, so. . ."
"RORY: It will be fine."
"PARIS: Are people still talking about my meltdown speech?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Great."
"RORY: Who cares what they're saying, Paris?"
"PARIS: Just give me more homework, it will keep my mind off my life."
"RORY: There is no more homework. In fact, I think you've almost finished your first year of college."
"PARIS: Well, I just can't sit here thinking. I'll go crazy."
"RORY: Why don't you go out and do something fun?"
"PARIS: Like what?"
"RORY: I don't know, but it's your last day of freedom. Go be wild. Go crazy. Don't think, just do."
"PARIS: Do what?"
"RORY: You're thinking."
"PARIS: But "
"RORY: Still thinking."
"PARIS: What if "
"RORY: Paris, don't think."
"PARIS: Okay, I won't think."
"RORY: I'll see you tomorrow."
"[hangs up and walks to the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Hey, do you think Luke can knock this wall out and build us a bigger kitchen in five hours?"
"RORY: You'll have to drop the laundry."
"LORELAI: Never mind. Oh my God, I'm exhausted."
"RORY: Are you too exhausted to talk about birthday week?"
"LORELAI: I'm never too tired to talk about birthday week."
"RORY: Okay, so, Monday I thought we'd start with facials at Sloopy's after school."
"LORELAI: Mudpack Monday, I love it."
"RORY: Then we'll have double feature Tuesday, Sephora Wednesday, complimentary makeover Thursday, and then, big fat fabulous Friday."
"LORELAI: D-day!"
"RORY: BD-day!"
"LORELAI: Culminating in the fabulous blowout of a party you're planning."
"RORY: Oh, I'm sorry, you wanted a party? I told everyone you didn't wanna make a big deal out of your birthday this year."
"LORELAI: You're not funny."
"RORY: Miss Patty and Babette wanted to hire these two hot guys to carry you around all day and feed you Bon-Bons, and Kirk wanted to hire the Red Hot Chili Peppers to play a concert in the square, but I said, Hey, please respect the lady's wishes. She deserves that at her age."
"LORELAI: Why are you so cruel to Mama?"
"RORY: I have to go."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: None of your business."
"LORELAI: You are planning something for Friday night, aren't you?"
"RORY: I'll bring back Chinese for dinner."
"LORELAI: And you tell people no matter what they say, I just couldn't accept a new car. It would be beneath me and I'd be completely humiliated. And a convertible would just make me fling myself off a building."
"[the phone rings]"
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Rory leaves]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello?"
"KAREN: Lorelai Gilmore?"
"LORELAI: You got her."
"KAREN: I'm calling from Richard Gilmore's office."
"LORELAI: Never heard of him."
"KAREN: Richard Gilmore, your father."
"LORELAI: Oh, tall, bow tie?"
"KAREN: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm with you now, go ahead."
"KAREN: Okay. Well, he'd like to set up an appointment to meet you for coffee. Would tomorrow work for you? Two o'clock?"
"LORELAI: Well "
"RICHARD: Make it three, Karen. I have that conference call at two."
"LORELAI: Is that my father?"
"KAREN: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Put him on the phone, please."
"KAREN: But "
"LORELAI: Hand it over, honey."
"KAREN: I -"
"LORELAI: Come on, let's go, chop chop."
"RICHARD: What are you doing?"
"KAREN: She wants to talk to you."
"RICHARD: Just tell her I'll meet her tomorrow."
"KAREN: I tried, it didn't work."
"RICHARD: But I pay you to make my appointments."
"LORELAI: Dad!"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, hello."
"LORELAI: Are you telling me that you were sitting right next to this woman while she called me?"
"RICHARD: She is my secretary, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You were sitting right there?"
"RICHARD: This is the way a proper business is conducted."
"LORELAI: Two feet from the phone?"
"RICHARD: I'm not going to argue with you. Are you available tomorrow or not?"
"LORELAI: What is this Dad?"
"RICHARD: I have something I need to discuss with you."
"LORELAI: Well, discuss it now."
"RICHARD: I don't have the time now."
"LORELAI: Well, put Mrs. Huh-wiggins on the phone. Have her tell me."
"RICHARD: Please, Lorelai, can you meet me tomorrow at three o'clock or not?"
"LORELAI: Fine, where?"
"RICHARD: I will have Karen call you tomorrow to confirm it and tell you the place."
"LORELAI: Why can't you just tell me now?"
"RICHARD: Leave me just a semblance of my structure, please."
"LORELAI: Fine. I'll talk to the woman sitting right next to you tomorrow."
"CUT TO WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Rory is at the counter placing an order]"
"FRAN: So, that's a four foot chocolate cake with individual vanilla cupcakes on top spelling out Happy 16th Birthday Lorelai?"
"RORY: That's right."
"FRAN: Would you like butter cream or whipped cream frosting on that?"
"RORY: Can you do both?"
"FRAN: That's a lot of frosting."
"RORY: I know, but it's my mom's favorite part. Once we tried to make a cake entirely out of frosting, which turned out to be better in theory than in actual execution."
"FRAN: Well, both frostings it is then. What time do you want to pick it up?"
"RORY: Miss Patty will pick it up around five."
"FRAN: All right, you're all set."
"RORY: Thanks, Fran."
"[Lane walks in]"
"LANE: We have a glitch."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: Well, apparently, the world's largest pizza was 122 feet, 8 inches."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: It says it right there."
"RORY: Well, obviously we can't do that."
"LANE: Obviously."
"RORY: So, then, we'll have to make it the largest pizza in Connecticut."
"LANE: Actually, Litchfield made one last year that was 98 feet."
"RORY: Pete said the biggest they could do was a twelve footer."
"LANE: Maybe you could make her the world's biggest something else."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LANE: I don't know. Taco?"
"RORY: I think the world's biggest taco would be a little difficult to serve, don't you?"
"LANE: Well, it would definitely be more of a commitment."
"RORY: We'll just have to tell her it's the world's biggest pizza."
"LANE: Lie to her on her birthday?"
"RORY: It's for her own good. So, how's the music selection coming?"
"LANE: Good. I've decided to choose one song from each year in Lorelai's life. I'm almost done, though I've hit a snag in 1974."
"RORY: Bad year?"
"LANE: It's making the year of the Macarena look inspired."
"[Rory and Lane come out of the bakery and start walking down the street]"
"RORY: Hey, can you stash this at your house til the party? It's just favors and stuff. [hands Lane some shopping bags]"
"LANE: Ironic, isn't it? You having to hide things at my house for a change."
"RORY: Life has come full circle. [they run into Jess walking out of the video store]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: I got the video for tonight."
"RORY: What'd you get?"
"JESS: Almost Famous."
"RORY: No, not again."
"JESS: I can't help it, I'm addicted."
"RORY: Fine, but if I'm going to spend two hours sitting there watching Kate Hudson commit su1c1de again, then we are ordering Indian food."
"JESS: Oh, come on."
"RORY: Hey, last night when we watched Ed Wood we got burgers like you wanted to."
"JESS: Okay, fine  tonight, Indian food, but tomorrow, Saturday Night Fever and Thai food."
"LANE: That's so cute. You're like a really sweet old agoraphobic couple."
"JESS: Thank you very much."
"LANE: Okay, I've gotta go. Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Lane leaves. Rory and Jess walk down the street]"
"JESS: So, it's been a couple days since you made the big decision. You still going to Yale?"
"RORY: Yes, I am. It's got all the classes I want and some really great teachers, and plus, you know, as an added bonus, it's really close to here."
"JESS: 22.8 miles."
"RORY: How'd you know that?"
"JESS: Do you Yahoo?"
"RORY: You looked it up?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: You looked it up."
"JESS: I just hit a couple buttons on the computer."
"RORY: You looked it up."
"JESS: I was bored. There was nothing on TV and I was fooling around, it was something to do, that's it."
"RORY: You looked it up."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Taylor and Nicole are sitting at a table going over some paperwork]"
"TAYLOR: I'd like the wording to be a little harsher."
"NICOLE: Taylor, it already says that if Aunt Tilly's Taffy delivers even two hours late, they forfeit all payment for that particular shipment and are liable for any loss of income that may result from that late delivery. It's pretty extreme."
"TAYLOR: Well, it may seem extreme, but these candy people are shifty characters."
"NICOLE: Why don't we leave the wording like it is for now and see how things go? We can always get tougher later if necessary."
"LUKE: Yeah, you can send over a couple of Oompa Loompas to kick the crap out of Aunt Tilly."
"TAYLOR: Are you still dating him?"
"NICOLE: Yes, I am."
"TAYLOR: Why?"
"NICOLE: Oh, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I mean, if you're lonely, I have a nephew I would love to introduce to you. He just got back from a three-year stint in a biosphere in Arizona. Can I give him your number?"
"LUKE: No."
"TAYLOR: I'm not talking to you."
"LUKE: It's my lucky day. Is he done?"
"TAYLOR: All right, fine. We'll leave it your way and see how it works out. [leaves]"
"LUKE: So, listen, after I dispose of Taylor's body, are we hitting a movie tonight?"
"NICOLE: Yeah, we are."
"LUKE: Okay."
"NICOLE: Uh, Luke, could you sit for a second, please?"
"LUKE: I could."
"NICOLE: Could you do it soon?"
"LUKE: Okay, listen, if I sit down, are we gonna have the conversation?"
"NICOLE: The conversation?"
"LUKE: Yeah, you know, the conversation."
"NICOLE: Luke, please."
"LUKE: Here comes the conversation."
"NICOLE: My parents are coming into town and I am going to have lunch with them and I thought maybe you'd like to join me."
"LUKE: Join you?"
"NICOLE: What do you say?"
"LUKE: It's not that I don't wanna meet your parents, it's just that I haven't met any parents for a long time."
"NICOLE: Well, you don't have to. I'm just giving you the option."
"JESS: Jeez, man, just meet her parents already."
"LUKE: Do you mind?"
"JESS: So what if they hate you? You've been there before."
"NICOLE: You know what, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you on the spot."
"LUKE: I'm not on the spot. Really, I'm completely off the spot. I'm spotless. Uh, what time's the lunch?"
"NICOLE: Two o'clock on Thursday."
"LUKE: Two o'clock on Thursday. Okay, two o'clock on Thursday, I'll be there."
"NICOLE: That's great. So I'll see you tonight?"
"LUKE: I'll see you tonight."
"[Nicole leaves]"
"JESS: I have to go."
"LUKE: Where?"
"JESS: School."
"LUKE: Oh, school, okay. Well, have a good day. . .at school."
"JESS: I will."
"[Jess leaves. Luke walks outside and watches him. Jess walks toward the school, then jogs to his car and drives off]"
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"[Students are talking as they wait for class to start]"
"MADELINE: Mills College."
"LOUISE: Isn't that the one where all those girls with bad hair cried because they were gonna let boys in?"
"MADELINE: Yes."
"LOUISE: And why are you going there?"
"MADELINE: It's the one that took me."
"LOUISE: But why'd you apply?"
"MADELINE: I needed a fallback option."
"LOUISE: Well, fall back, baby, right into some big mama's loving arms."
"MADELINE: Ooh, how depressing. Let's talk about you, did you decide?"
"LOUISE: Last night."
"MADELINE: Brandeis?"
"LOUISE: Tulane."
"MADELINE: The Big Easy."
"LOUISE: Enough said."
"[Paris walks in with a bandage on her nose]"
"RORY: Oh, Paris, hi, you're back. I. . .oh my God. What happened to your nose?"
"MADELINE: You had it done."
"LOUISE: Finally."
"PARIS: I did not have it done."
"RORY: Did you fall?"
"PARIS: No, I didn't fall. I had it pierced."
"MADELINE: You what?"
"LOUISE: Oh my God."
"RORY: Why would you do that?"
"PARIS: Because you told me to go out and do something crazy."
"RORY: Yes, but I meant have some ice cream, go see three movies, buy a new purse. I didn't mean go poke a third hold in your nose."
"PARIS: Well, I didn't buy a new purse, I pierced my nose. And within an hour of having it done, my nose swelled up to four times its normal size, blocking all nasal passage, making it impossible to breathe. I went to the emergency room, where they pried the thing out of my nose and sh*t me up with antibiotics. I spent the night with an ice pack strapped to my face."
"RORY: Oh, Paris."
"PARIS: It seems that I was allergic to the crap metal hoop that I paid $19.95 to have jammed into my nose."
"LOUISE: Did you take a picture?"
"PARIS: No, Louise, I did not take a picture. I was a little busy trying to get air to my brain cells, a burden you've not yet faced."
"RORY: Paris, I'm so sorry. I . . [cell phone rings]. . .I didn't. . . [answers phone] Hello?"
"PETE: Rorino, good, I caught ya. Okay, there's a bit of a design flaw in the pizza here."
"RORY: What kind of design flaw?"
"PETE: I'm a little concerned that the crust is not gonna be able to support all the toppings we talked about. We might need to put in a second crust."
"RORY: A second crust?"
"PETE: About three-quarters of the way in, sort of like a retaining wall."
"RORY: What about just making the crust thicker?"
"PETE: Okay, we're brainstorming, I got it. A thicker crust, a thicker crust, that might do it. Uh, let me noodle around with that for awhile and get back to you."
"RORY: Okay. Bye Pete. [hangs up]"
"PARIS: [to boy] I will not let you look at my nose for ten dollars, you sick job. b*at it, now! Come back when you have a twenty. [to Rory] What? Just making lemonade here."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[There's a knock at the back door.]"
"LORELAI: I'm coming!"
"[Lorelai walks to the kitchen, where she finds the table decorated with cookies spelling out Happy Birthday Lorelai'.]"
"LORELAI: Aw! [there's another knock] Coming."
"[She answers the door, Luke walks in with his toolbox]"
"LORELAI: Hiya."
"LUKE: Your slave is here."
"LORELAI: And where's the French maid outfit I requested?"
"LUKE: I've got it on under the plaid."
"LORELAI: So what else is new?"
"LUKE: So, how does it feel to be a year older?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm not a year older until Friday, Fifi."
"[Lorelai eats a cookie from the table.]"
"LUKE: What the hell is this?"
"LORELAI: My birthday Mallomars."
"LUKE: She says like I should just know this."
"LORELAI: Here's your list. [hands him a notepad]"
"LUKE: What's wrong with the garbage disposal?"
"LORELAI: It's not disposing."
"[Luke reaches into the sink and pulls out a spoon]"
"LUKE: Next."
"LORELAI: You're so good!"
"[Lorelai pulls a box of Mallomars out of the cupboard]"
"LUKE: Did you ever consider the possibility of just pulling the spoon out yourself?"
"LORELAI: I did consider it, yes. Do you wanna start upstairs or down? Cause there's actually more to do upstairs this time for some reason."
"[Lorelai takes a Mallomar out of the box and puts it on the table]"
"LUKE: What'd you just do?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You put the cookie down."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: You ate the cookie, and then you took a cookie out of the box and put it where the cookie you just ate was."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: Well, that's nuts."
"LORELAI: Rory made this for me, I don't wanna ruin it."
"LUKE: Then why'd you eat the cookie?"
"LORELAI: Cause I wanted a Mallomar."
"LUKE: But why didn't you just eat one out of the box?"
"LORELAI: Cause this one was right here. The box was all the way in the cupboard."
"LUKE: But you had to go to the cupboard to get the box to replace the cookie you ate off the table."
"LORELAI: So?"
"LUKE: Looking at the list now. Okay, stairs, gutters, da-duh-da-duh-da, electrical outlet. Which one?"
"LORELAI: In the bathroom."
"LUKE: By the sink or by the bathtub?"
"LORELAI: Bathtub."
"LUKE: Okay. So, I can do most of this list today, but, uh, I can't put up the towel rack until later. I didn't bring my drill."
"LORELAI: Heh "
"LUKE: Dirty, yes, I know."
"LORELAI: Um, that's okay, I'll be here tomorrow afternoon if you wanna come by then."
"LUKE: I can't tomorrow, I'm having lunch with Nicole's parents."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: They're coming into town."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: So Nicole thought I should meet them."
"LORELAI: Makes sense."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, you know, we've been seeing each other fairly regular now, so. . .makes sense."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I think it's great."
"LUKE: Yeah, I do, too. I should get started upstairs. By the way. . ."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You were right about Jess."
"LORELAI: What about Jess?"
"LUKE: He's not going to school."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"LUKE: Yup. I watched him head right toward the school and when he thought no one was watching him, he got in his car and drove off. So I got in my truck and followed him."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"LUKE: To Wal-Mart."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: He's been lying to me this whole time."
"LORELAI: What are you gonna do?"
"LUKE: I'm gonna tell him that I know what he's been doing, remind him that we had an agreement, that he's supposed to go to school, that he's supposed to graduate from school, and then. . .I'm gonna tell him I know what he's been doing."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, Luke."
"LUKE: Yeah, well. I'm gonna be upstairs."
"LORELAI: Okay. Call if you need anything."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE MARKET"
"[Rory wheels a cart full of soda cases out of the market. Jackson walks up to her.]"
"JACKSON: Rory!"
"RORY: Hey, Jackson. Listen, could you "
"JACKSON: What do you think you're doing?"
"RORY: Oh, well, I'm trying to transport all the sodas for the party in one trip, which seemed a little silly when I first come up with the idea and it's rapidly growing in its stupidity."
"JACKSON: You know, I never took you for being thoughtless, but I guess I was wrong."
"RORY: What are you talking about? I got the sugarless Red Bull just like you like."
"JACKSON: You really hurt Sookie, you know that?"
"RORY: Why, what did I do?"
"JACKSON: What did you do, what did you do? Hm, let me see, what did you do?"
"RORY: Uh, Jackson, if you could stop moving around, it'd be a lot easier."
"JACKSON: You know, I just heard you're making the world's largest pizza for Lorelai's birthday party, is that true?"
"RORY: Yes."
"JACKSON: And it doesn't occur to you to consult Sookie?"
"RORY: Oh. Oh no."
"JACKSON: The woman is a gourmet chef and Lorelai's best friend in the world, and you don't include her in this?"
"RORY: But Sookie's an artist  pizzas didn't really seem to be her thing."
"JACKSON: Everything's her thing, young lady."
"RORY: Jackson, I swear, I would never purposely hurt Sookie. Besides, it's not the world's largest pizza. It's not even the tri-county area's largest pizza."
"JACKSON: I have a sobbing pregnant woman at home, which is not unusual, except this time I didn't cause it!"
"RORY: I'm so, so sorry."
"JACKSON: And by the way, there wouldn't happen to be vegetables on that pizza, would there?"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"JACKSON: Because I don't know if you got the memo or not, but I happen to be a produce man."
"RORY: And a darn good one at that."
"JACKSON: Yet, I don't remember a call asking me to handle the vegetables. Was there a call? Did I just miss it? Was I out?"
"RORY: Well, you see, the veggies were included in the price, so it just. . ."
"JACKSON: Hm. [storms off]"
"RORY: Jackson, I'm sorry!"
"JACKSON: I hope you and your world's largest pizza will be very happy together!"
"RORY: It's not the largest pizza in the world! We may b*at Woodbridge, but that's it, I swear!"

"CUT TO RESTAURANT"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table. Richard walks in and sits down with her]"
"RICHARD: Sorry, sorry, sorry."
"LORELAI: Everything okay?"
"RICHARD: Oh, yes. I just had a few calls to make that took up a bit more time than I had anticipated. Have you been here long?"
"LORELAI: Twenty minutes and two pieces of pie."
"RICHARD: Amazing. Well, then, let's get right down to it, shall we?"
"[a waitress walks over]"
"WAITRESS: Can I get you something to drink?"
"RICHARD: Uh, iced tea, please."
"WAITRESS: Another cup of coffee, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Thanks, Sarie."
"[the waitress leaves]"
"RICHARD: So, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: So, Dad."
"RICHARD: I appreciate you taking the time out to meet me like this."
"LORELAI: And I appreciate you actually showing up and not sending your secretary."
"RICHARD: I assume you're wondering why I asked you here."
"LORELAI: Not at all."
"RICHARD: Well, I have something for you. [places an envelope on the table]"
"LORELAI: Is it a hat?"
"RICHARD: No."
"LORELAI: Is it a purse?"
"RICHARD: No."
"LORELAI: Horse?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: George Foreman Grill?"
"RICHARD: When you were born, I decided to celebrate, so as soon as your mother went to sleep, I left the hospital, I called my business manager and I made a real estate investment."
"LORELAI: You do know how to party, don't you?"
"RICHARD: I made this investment in your name."
"LORELAI: Wow, most people just buy a stuffed bear. This is better."
"RICHARD: I thought so. Anyhow, a little while ago, I got a letter from a lawyer who is representing the investment group informing me that the government is building a road right through the middle of your investment."
"LORELAI: Sad."
"RICHARD: Which means that the complex has been sold and all the investors will be receiving a check."
"LORELAI: Happy."
"RICHARD: Since you are one of the investors. . ."
"LORELAI: I get a check?"
"RICHARD: You get a check."
"LORELAI: Wow! That's. . .[opens the envelope] Seventy-five thousand dollars?"
"RICHARD: Yes, it is."
"LORELAI: I get seventy-five thousand dollars for being born?"
"RICHARD: I thought it would be a pleasant surprise."
"LORELAI: This is seventy-five thousand dollars. Seventy-five. . .do you have a pen?"
"RICHARD: Why, yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Seventy-five thousand dollars. Seventy-five thousand dollars. Oh my God, that's like 150 pairs of Jimmy Choos."
"RICHARD: What are Jimmy Choos?"
"LORELAI: Shoes."
"RICHARD: 150 pairs, that's it?"
"LORELAI: Dad, they're Jimmy Choos."
"RICHARD: For seventy-five thousand dollars, you should be able to buy at least three or four hundred pairs of shoes."
"LORELAI: Not Jimmy Choos."
"RICHARD: But that's ridiculous. You are not going to spend seventy-five thousand dollars on Jimmy Choos when you could buy four hundred pairs of less prestigious but I'm sure equally stylish shoes. You will shop around first. Is that clear?"
"LORELAI: Yes, sir."
"RICHARD: All right, then. It's settled."
"LORELAI: Listen, Dad, this money isn't, um. . ."
"RICHARD: Isn't what?"
"LORELAI: It isn't some kind of gift, is it?"
"RICHARD: Gift?"
"LORELAI: Like a birthday gift. Because if it is, it's too much and I can't "
"RICHARD: This isn't a gift. I made this investment in your name. You received a check, that's the way these things work. Legally, I'm obligated to give you that. This isn't charity or generosity, it is the law."
"LORELAI: It's the law that I get to keep seventy-five thousand dollars."
"RICHARD: Enjoy the shoes."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the floor by the coffee table]"
"LORELAI: We could buy a boat."
"RORY: We could, but why?"
"LORELAI: Because rich people always have a boat."
"RORY: We could park it in the front yard."
"LORELAI: Yeah, like white trash rich people."
"RORY: God, this is amazing. No more clipping coupons."
"LORELAI: No more picking loose change up from the ground. No more driving around looking for cheap gas."
"RORY: Which totally defeats the purpose since you wind up using more gas looking for the cheap gas."
"LORELAI: Seventy-five thousand dollars. I feel so rich. And suddenly in complete agreement with everything Bush has to say."
"[the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: I'll get it."
"RORY: No!"
"LORELAI: Ah, more secret birthday calls."
"RORY: Not everything is about you. It could be Jess."
"LORELAI: It's about me."
"RORY: It could be Lane."
"LORELAI: It's about me."
"RORY: It could be Paris, it could be Madeline, it could be Louise, it could be a myriad of other people wanting only to talk to me about me."
"LORELAI: It's about me."
"[Rory takes the phone to her room]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"PETE: Rory, we got a big problemo."
"RORY: What's the matter, Pete?"
"PETE: We did a trial run of the pizza. You know, just wanna make sure everything was right there for the big day, you know."
"RORY: I appreciate that."
"PETE: So we made a trial pizza, and Kirk built a pizza rack on top of his car, you with me?"
"RORY: Like a bad habit, Pete."
"PETE: So as Kirk's putting the pizza on the rack, the thing collapses, the pizza slips, long story short  Kirk has got some severe cheese burns."
"RORY: Oh my God, is he all right?"
"KIRK: Ow."
"PETE: Who knows? The point is. . ."
"KIRK: Oh."
"PETE: I think the pizza needs to be cheeseless."
"RORY: What?"
"PETE: And possibly sauceless."
"RORY: Pete."
"PETE: The thing's a hazard, babe."
"RORY: Pete, did it ever occur to you that the problem may not be the pizza, it may be Kirk?"
"PETE: Did not occur to me."
"RORY: Well, it should have."
"PETE: Okay."
"RORY: The pizza has to have cheese and sauce, otherwise, it's not a pizza. It's bread."
"PETE: Okay, look, if you're gonna insist on the cheese and the sauce, you're gonna have to provide the transportation yourself."
"RORY: Fine, Pete, I will figure something out."
"PETE: Roger wilco, senorita."
"[They hang up. Lorelai opens Rory's bedroom door]"
"LORELAI: Who was it?"
"RORY: Astrid from school. She's leaving for Europe for a week and she wants me to take notes and email her everything. She's afraid she's gonna fall behind."
"LORELAI: It was about me."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke is sitting at the table when Jess walks in]"
"JESS: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey. You're home late."
"JESS: Traffic."
"LUKE: Traffic, right, okay. So, you hungry?"
"JESS: I'm meeting Rory."
"LUKE: Want me to make you guys some sandwiches?"
"JESS: So we can brown bag it on our date? I don't think so."
"LUKE: Just offering. How was work?"
"JESS: The cleaned-up version of The Eminem Show seems to be selling pretty well, so the world is basically coming to an end."
"LUKE: So listen, I, um, wanna talk to you about something."
"JESS: Talk."
"LUKE: Could you stop grooming for just a second please?"
"JESS: I'm already late."
"LUKE: Look, I was doing some thinking about your situation."
"JESS: My situation?"
"LUKE: Yeah, you know, you're working here, you're working at Wal-Mart, you're dating Rory, going to school. It just seems like a lot. You ever worry that if a bird flies into your head it might never get out again?"
"JESS: I've got everything under control."
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm sure you do. I just thought maybe I could make things a little easier."
"JESS: How?"
"LUKE: Well, I could, uh, give you a raise at the diner."
"JESS: A raise?"
"LUKE: Yeah. And maybe help out with some of the, you know, bigger money burdens, like your car insurance."
"JESS: Why would you wanna do that?"
"LUKE: So you can quit your job at Wal-Mart."
"JESS: No way."
"LUKE: But you'd still be making money, and this way, you'd get to spend more time on Rory and school."
"JESS: I'm fine."
"LUKE: Jess, come on."
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: Jess, just take the deal."
"JESS: I have to change."
"LUKE: I know you're not going to school."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: I saw you get in your car and drive off."
"JESS: You spying on me?"
"LUKE: You lied to me!"
"JESS: Once in awhile I take an extra shift, it's nothing."
"LUKE: You have to go to school, Jess."
"JESS: I go enough."
"LUKE: What does that mean?"
"JESS: It means I go enough. It's public school. My history teacher is also the football coach, get the picture?"
"LUKE: Jess, we had a deal. You go to school, you graduate."
"JESS: I know. Relax. I got it all under control. I have to change."
"LUKE: Jess."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is on the phone at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: That's right, breakfast is included. Then at five, we invite all the guests to the lobby for complimentary wine and cheese and mingling. . . Yes, it is kind of like a B&B. . . Okay, great. We'll see you and Sweetie then. Bye."
"[She hangs up, then walks over to a table where Tobin is standing with some staffers]"
"TOBIN: Any thoughts? So, as you know, we have to get this place up and running as quickly as possible for as little money as possible. So last night I pulled out the old Time Life series, and I have to admit, there's some pretty terrific ideas in here. For example, we can putty up the cracks in the drywall and then give the lower part of the wall a good coat of paint. Then we can take a strip of wallpaper, put it around the top, thus creating sort of a border, if you will. Also, I gathered up all the broken China from the dining room because I read here in Martha that chipped teacups make great votive holders, and we all know, when in doubt, it's candles, candles, candles, right? So I cleaned them up, filled them with tealights, and I think they look terrific. Oh, the pieces that were too far gone to save, I just smashed them up and used the pieces to make this nice picture frame."
"LORELAI: Ah, that's a great idea, Tobin, really."
"MICHEL: Uh, Lorelai. I have a little something for you."
"LORELAI: For me?"
"MICHEL: Yes. I wasn't sure it would get here in time since I ordered it from Madrid, but thank God it made it. Happy birthday. [hands her a gift bag]"
"LORELAI: You bought me a present?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"LORELAI: You've never bought me a present."
"MICHEL: I have, too."
"LORELAI: Not once in the five years I've known you have you ever "
"MICHEL: Just open up the bag, please."
"[Lorelai pulls a journal out of the bag]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Michel, it's beautiful."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, I wanted it to be special, you know. Not just some knick- knack you could pick up at the supermarket or the car wash."
"LORELAI: Well, it's great. I love it. I must say, I feel very spoiled. A beautiful day book, cappuccino candle."
"TOBIN: Oh, that reminds me, I got you something else. [walks over to the front desk]"
"LORELAI: What? Tobin, you already gave me a gift."
"TOBIN: No, that was a pre-gift."
"MICHEL: A what?"
"TOBIN: Hold on. [to Michel] Why don't you scooch just a little bit for me?"
"[Tobin retrieves a bag from behind the desk, then hands it to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Tobin, this is too much."
"TOBIN: Yes, it is, but I saw it and it just screamed Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay, well. . .God, this is exciting. I love my birthday."
"TOBIN: I hope it fits."
"MICHEL: Fits?"
"[Lorelai pulls a leather jacket out of the bag]"
"LORELAI: Tobin, it's amazing."
"TOBIN: That is the jacket that Joe Strummer wore during the 1979 Pearl Harbor tour."
"LORELAI: No."
"TOBIN: Yes."
"MICHEL: Who is Joe Strummer?"
"LORELAI: Tell me you're kidding."
"MICHEL: Who is Joe Strummer?"
"LORELAI: You did not get me this."
"MICHEL: Is he a Hell's Angel man?"
"TOBIN: Joe Strummer is from The Clash."
"LORELAI: The Clash is a band."
"TOBIN: And a band is a "
"MICHEL: I know what a band is."
"LORELAI: He just died, and Rory and Lane have been in mourning for months, and now I have his jacket. And, oh my God, this is by far the coolest thing I have ever gotten. God. Oh, smell it, it smells like Joe."
"MICHEL: Well, this is wonderful, to smell like a dead guy. You'll have to b*at them off with a stick."
"TOBIN: And there's a letter of authenticity in the bag, and a picture of Joe wearing the jacket, and also, they threw in a beret just for the heck of it."
"LORELAI: Tobin, you are getting a hug!"
"TOBIN: Well, I'd fight it, but what's the point, right?"
"MICHEL: I have to run an errand."
"LORELAI: Why, where you going?"
"MICHEL: Just be here when I get back."
"LORELAI: Oh, I just love this jacket."
"CUT TO LEAHY RESIDENCE"
"[Luke and Nicole are sitting across from Nicole's parents in the living room]"
"MR. LEAHY: Nicole, you're being "
"NICOLE: I am not being stubborn."
"MR. LEAHY: You didn't let me get the stubborn out."
"MRS. LEAHY: Luke, would you like a blini?"
"LUKE: No, thank you."
"MR. LEAHY: When you sign up to become a surrogate mother, you enter into a business agreement, and the rules of business should apply. You as a lawyer should understand that."
"NICOLE: As a lawyer, I do understand that. As a human being, I also understand that when a woman's alone "
"MR. LEAHY: Here we go."
"NICOLE: And in need of money, can do things that she'll later regret."
"MRS. LEAHY: I could get you some cheese."
"NICOLE: You cannot force a mother to give up her child."
"MR. LEAHY: If she signed a paper saying, On April the 12th I am giving birth and whatever comes out, I'm handing to you. . ."
"NICOLE: What a lovely way to put that."
"MR. LEAHY: And you pay her money and her medical expenses. . ."
"MRS. LEAHY: They always do this. They pick a subject and they argue until dinner, then they call a truce and they pick it back up for dessert. I could get you some nuts."
"NICOLE: Okay, enough. I don't wanna argue with you anymore."
"MR. LEAHY: What can I do with her, Luke? I ask you."
"LUKE: Oh, well, uh, probably not much."
"MRS. LEAHY: So Luke, I feel like we've been ignoring you."
"LUKE: Oh, that's okay."
"MRS. LEAHY: Nicole told us you've never been married."
"NICOLE: Or we could talk about how he owns his own diner. That's a good opening topic."
"MRS. LEAHY: Hush, sweetheart. You just sit there and pretend to be ashamed of us."
"LUKE: Uh, no, I have never been married."
"MRS. LEAHY: But someday, maybe, right? Marriage, children?"
"NICOLE: She means eventually and with the woman of your choice. They will not be involved in the picking."
"MRS. LEAHY: Because there is nothing more wonderful than marriage."
"NICOLE: You know, the others escaped out the bathroom window. Just a tip."
"MRS. LEAHY: And then children. Well, there's nothing more rewarding than children. You just can't imagine until you've been there."
"MR. LEAHY: That's true. And this one here made everything in life worth it."
"MRS. LEAHY: The whole experience is like the most fabulous roller coaster ride you can imagine. From the time they're born to that first step. The first word. The first time they hug you. The first time they pick out their own outfits."
"LUKE: The first time they tell you they're going to school and then you follow them, and they get in their car and drive to Wal-Mart."
"MR. LEAHY: Wal-Mart?"
"LUKE: And they think you don't know. They think you're just a moron and you're going, Hey, they must be telling me the truth, right? And they don't think that maybe you know that they're lying to your face and that you're really mad because you guys had an agreement."
"MRS. LEAHY: Oh dear."
"LUKE: And that agreement was clear, very clear. And they know that breaking that agreement is a violation of everything you had talked about. Oh yeah, that is cute. That's just darling. I can't wait to experience that again. [pause] I'm sorry, did someone mention cheese?"
"CUT TO PIZZA SHOP"
"[Rory walks in. Kirk, Joe and Pete are at a table]"
"RORY: Hey guys."
"PETE: Rory, good, just the lady we're looking for. We have a plan."
"RORY: Good, cause I've got a check."
"PETE: We've solved the problem of transporting the big pizza thing."
"KIRK: I was of little help since I'm currently in excruciating pain."
"PETE: Instead of this whole one huge pizza concept, we're gonna do a hundred little pizzas all sitting next to each other."
"RORY: What?"
"JOE: Like a pizza doily."
"RORY: I don't want a pizza doily."
"PETE: Okay, less a doily, more of a collage."
"RORY: I don't want a pizza collage either."
"JOE: Hey guys, I got another idea. How about we put the pizzas together, and then put pepperonis over the open spots."
"PETE: So it looks like one big pizza, tricky."
"RORY: Okay, hold on."
"JOE: Or we could put cheese over the holes."
"KIRK: Please don't say the C- word."
"RORY: Guys."
"PETE: Cheese might fall through the holes."
"JOE: We can use slices."
"PETE: That'll work."
"RORY: That will not work!"
"PETE: Hey, Rory."
"RORY: No. Now you three listen to me. We agreed that this was going to be the world's largest pizza. That was the concept. Now I realize it can't be the world's largest pizza because that pizza was insane, but it is still going to be large. Very large. Crazy large."
"PETE: But we "
"RORY: No buts! That was the concept  get back to the concept! This is not Gangs of New York now with Cameron Diaz. This is Gangs of New York twenty years ago with Meryl Streep as Scorsese originally imagined it. Come back, refocus, remember the goal. Am I making myself clear?"
"JOE: Cameron Diaz is hot."
"RORY: Not the point, Joe."
"JOE: Okay, jeez."
"RORY: Now tonight is my mother's birthday party and the whole town is going to be there and they are expecting music, favors, and a really large pizza and they will not be disappointed. I don't care how you do it, just do it!"
"KIRK: Somehow I can't picture Meryl Streep with Leonardo Dicaprio."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is behind the counter on the phone]"
"LUKE: I really am sorry, Nicole. Your parents must think I'm a lunatic."
"NICOLE: No, I don't think lunatic was one of the words they used. But they have a very extensive vocabulary, so there may just not have been time."
"LUKE: It's the first time I meet them and I just. . .Jess was driving me crazy and. . ."
"NICOLE: I know this. I told them this."
"LUKE: I swear, when they come back into town, I will do better."
"JESS: I'm going to school. [leaves]"
"NICOLE: They may not be back in town for several months."
"LUKE: Whenever."
"NICOLE: Whenever? So I can make another lunch date with my parents even though it's several months away?"
"LUKE: Sure, make it."
"NICOLE: Okay, I'll make it."
"LUKE: Tell them I've gotten some medication, I'm much better now."
"NICOLE: I'll do that."
"[Jess walks back into the diner]"
"JESS: Get off the phone!"
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: I need the phone, get off the phone!"
"LUKE: What's the matter?"
"JESS: Someone stole my car."
"LUKE: Nicole, I'm gonna have to call you back. [hangs up] What do you mean somebody stole your car?"
"[Jess picks up the phone and starts dialing]"
"JESS: I parked it right around the corner and now it's gone."
"LUKE: Why would you park it around the corner?"
"JESS: Because that's where I parked it. How the hell can the police department have an answering machine? [hangs up the phone]"
"LUKE: Look, let's just calm down."
"JESS: Who would steal that car? It hardly ran."
"LUKE: Well, you know these chop shops, they can make a buck out of anything."
"JESS: I am gonna k*ll whoever did this. I'm gonna find them and k*ll them."
"LUKE: Listen, just go on over to school, I'll take care of anything."
"JESS: No, I gotta talk to the cops."
"LUKE: I'll do that, go. You know, you don't wanna be late to your first class, right?"
"JESS: Well, yeah, but "
"LUKE: I mean, you were planning on going to school, right?"
"JESS: Right."
"LUKE: Okay, well, then just walk on over to school and I'll take care of the rest."
"JESS: Fine."
"LUKE: All right, have a good day. Study hard, don't worry. Just leave the car to me."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily, Richard, Rory and the maids sing Happy Birthday to Lorelai in the dining room]"
"ALL: [singing] Happy birthday dear Lorelai, happy birthday to you."
"EMILY: You can take the cake into the kitchen now, Teresa."
"[the maid takes the cake away]"
"LORELAI: Wait, aren't I supposed to blow them out?"
"EMILY: Oh, Teresa can do that."
"LORELAI: Mom, it's tradition for the person whose name is on the cake to do the blowing."
"EMILY: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought only children liked to do that. Should we bring it back out and relight it?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RICHARD: Well, would you like to make a wish and blow out the tapers?"
"LORELAI: Why am I being mocked on my birthday?"
"RORY: Because that's the Gilmore way."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"EMILY: Let's move into the living room for our dessert, shall we?"
"LORELAI: Let's shall."
"[they all start walking to the living room]"
"LORELAI: [quietly to Rory] How're we doing on time?"
"RORY: We've got time for cake."
"LORELAI: Are you sure? Cause I don't wanna miss the fancy party you're throwing me."
"RORY: Don't worry, it's not that fancy."
"EMILY: What are the two of you whispering about?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"RICHARD: Champagne?"
"LORELAI: Trying to get me drunk so I forget that you wouldn't let me blow out my own candles?"
"EMILY: Oh, dear, is this going to be another one of those stories that you tell people for the rest of your life like the bunny story?"
"LORELAI: His name was Murray, Mom."
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily, you had to bring that up."
"LORELAI: How could you think I wouldn't notice you gave away my rabbit?"
"EMILY: Because you were four and terrified of the thing."
"LORELAI: I was not terrified, I simply respected his space."
"RICHARD: You slept in the maid's room for a week."
"LORELAI: I wonder where Murray is now."
"RICHARD: In a shoebox somewhere, I assume."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"LORELAI: Very nice, and on my birthday."
"RICHARD: Once again, a toast to Lorelai on her 36th birthday."
"LORELAI: 35th."
"RICHARD: Really?"
"LORELAI: You're doing the math?"
"RICHARD: Right, sorry. To Lorelai on her 35th birthday."
"RORY: Hear, hear."
"LORELAI: Thank you for the toast, thank you for the dinner, and, uh, in the spirit of the evening  Mom, I have something for you."
"EMILY: For me? It's not my birthday."
"LORELAI: I know, but here. [hands Emily an envelope]"
"RICHARD: Oh."
"EMILY: What is this?"
"LORELAI: It's from Murray. It's taken him this long to write it partially cause of the hurt and pain and partially cause he has paws."
"EMILY: What is this?"
"LORELAI: That is what I owe you."
"EMILY: What you owe me?"
"LORELAI: For Rory's school. I promised you I'd pay you back and now I have, every cent. Thank you again for helping us out. There's no way Rory would be going to Yale if it wasn't for this money, if it wasn't for you."
"EMILY: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: Okay, so. . ."
"EMILY: You must be very relieved."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: Your debt is paid, you owe us nothing."
"LORELAI: Well, yeah."
"EMILY: You don't need us anymore."
"LORELAI: Um, I didn't say "
"EMILY: You don't have to deal with us. You don't have to come over for Friday night dinners. It all works out beautifully, doesn't it?"
"LORELAI: This isn't about that, Mom."
"EMILY: Oh no?"
"LORELAI: No, I owed you money and I paid you back."
"EMILY: I don't want it."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you're mad that I'm paying you back."
"EMILY: I'm not mad, I just think it's extremely unkind of you to use this occasion to inform me you won't be coming over anymore."
"LORELAI: I didn't say that."
"EMILY: This says that!"
"LORELAI: Mom, let me ask you something  wouldn't you rather we came over here because we wanted to, not because of some threat you're holding over our heads?"
"EMILY: Oh, and you would come here voluntarily?"
"LORELAI: I always said I would pay you back. This is not a surprise."
"EMILY: No, it certainly isn't."
"LORELAI: I was trying to do a good thing here. When Dad gave me the money, one of the first things that jumped into my head was to -"
"EMILY: When Dad gave you the money? When Dad gave her the money?"
"RICHARD: Now, Emily "
"EMILY: You gave her this?"
"RICHARD: It was her money."
"LORELAI: It was from that investment, Mom."
"RICHARD: I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of this."
"LORELAI: Why are you mad at me?"
"RICHARD: I told you not to tell your mother about that money."
"LORELAI: When did you tell me that?"
"RICHARD: At lunch."
"LORELAI: You did not."
"RICHARD: I did, too."
"LORELAI: Dad, I swear you didn't tell me not to tell Mom."
"RICHARD: Why do you think I met you in the day at a restaurant, Lorelai? Think."
"LORELAI: I "
"EMILY: You kept this from me, Richard?"
"RICHARD: I knew you would be upset."
"EMILY: You lied to me."
"RICHARD: I had to give it to her. I was legally obligated."
"EMILY: You're also legally obligated to your wife."
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: Don't you talk to me!"
"RICHARD: Now, you're overreacting."
"EMILY: Don't you talk to me either!"
"LORELAI: Don't be mad at Dad."
"RICHARD: Stay out of this!"
"LORELAI: I just "
"RICHARD: Well, don't!"
"LORELAI: Mom, please. Just because I gave you this money doesn't mean we're never gonna come over here again. We will come over. Maybe not every week, but there will be the occasional Friday night dinners."
"EMILY: No, there won't."
"RORY: Grandma "
"EMILY: I don't need anybody doing me any favors. You are released from your obligation, Lorelai. Have a nice birthday, have a nice life, I'm going to bed."
"LORELAI: Dad "
"RICHARD: Not now!"
"[Emily and Richard leave the room]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking through the town square]"
"LORELAI: You're quiet. I know they were upset, hon, but trust me, they'll calm down."
"RORY: Why did you do that?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Just giving them that check like that."
"LORELAI: Rory, I borrowed that money."
"RORY: I know you did, but you had to have known that they'd get upset. You had to know that Grandma would take it personally."
"LORELAI: Well, what would you have me do, not pay them back?"
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Maybe?"
"RORY: Well, they didn't want the money back."
"LORELAI: It's not the point."
"RORY: Well, it's kind of the point."
"LORELAI: No, Rory, it's not the point at all."
"RORY: They were throwing you a party, Mom."
"LORELAI: Sorry, did I miss something? Did I dance around saying nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah when I gave her the check?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Did, did I not thank her  genuinely thank her for everything?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Did I not credit your getting into Yale with them giving us that money?"
"RORY: Yes, but "
"LORELAI: Unh uh, no buts. Listen Rory, I'm not sure if you're aware of how hard it has been for me these past three years to be indebted to my parents. I decided a long time ago that I was gonna live my life without their help, but I went to them and I took their money and I'm not sorry I did, it was the right thing for you, but I don't need their help anymore."
"RORY: Fine, but you don't have to just throw it in their faces like that."
"LORELAI: I paid back a loan. You're supposed to pay back a loan. I have Polonius and then entire banking system on my side."
"RORY: I just think you could've done it differently."
"LORELAI: How?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Take a sh*t."
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Rory, my relationship with my parents is very different from your relationship with them. You only know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily, and I only want you to know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily because they're your grandparents and they love you, but I have a different history with them and it was not all warm and it was definitely not all fuzzy. So do not judge me for repaying a loan that I always intended to repay, that I told them from the beginning I would repay, that I had to repay. I will not let them make me feel guilty for doing that and I will not let you make me feel guilty for doing that either."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: It's okay."
"[They walk down the street some more. Lorelai sees a large group of people gathered for her birthday party at the dance studio. A crane is lowering the huge pizza onto a table]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. What is that?"
"RORY: The world's largest pizza. Almost."
"LORELAI: That is amazing."
"RORY: You like it?"
"LORELAI: I love it. Thank you honey. Hey, what happened to Kirk?"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the couch]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I know! How about . . .no."
"RORY: No, no, you can't keep doing that. You can't just start a thought and then say no. Finish them or don't start them at all."
"LORELAI: You're very totalitarian today."
"RORY: No, it just drives me crazy. It's like if you do ""shave and a haircut"" without the last part, you know?"
"LORELAI: Come on, do it."
"RORY: Will you stop giving me half-finished thoughts?"
"LORELAI: I promise. Come on, do it."
"RORY: Two bits."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"RORY: Now what were you thinking?"
"LORELAI: Pizza and TV."
"RORY: That's our fallback."
"LORELAI: That's why I said not, I remembered it was our fallback."
"RORY: When did we become so old and pathetic?"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, we're neither. We're momentarily stuck on what to do tonight."
"RORY: It's a Friday night. We should be out, I don't know, partying with the homies."
"LORELAI: Our Stars Hollow homies are all in bed by now."
"RORY: Not Kirk. He'll be playing video trivia at the pizza place. We could go and watch."
"LORELAI: Okay, we're old and pathetic. How did it come to this?"
"RORY: Well, it's our first Friday night that we haven't had to go to Grandma and Grandpa's for dinner."
"LORELAI: I cannot for the life of me remember what we did before we started doing those."
"RORY: It feels like a million years ago."
"[Rory walks over to get the phone]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, who are you calling?"
"RORY: It just feels weird for me not even to say hello to them on a Friday night."
"LORELAI: No, don't call them."
"RORY: Hey, this rift is between you and them. I'm still on friendly terms."
"LORELAI: I know, it's just that they're probably sitting there eating alone, shivering in an unheated room, the only illumination a single light bulb just so they can make us feel spectacularly guilty at the thought."
"RORY: [on phone] Hey Grandpa, it's Rory. . . Rory."
"LORELAI: He's pretending not to remember you?"
"RORY: No, it's loud there."
"LORELAI: Loud?"
"RORY: What's going on there?"
"RICHARD: Oh, we're having a party."
"RORY: A party?"
"LORELAI: A party?"
"RICHARD: Sort of a last minute thing. Couldn't get too big a crowd here. I think we wound up with 55 or 60, something like that."
"RORY: 60 people."
"RICHARD: Oh, here come the mushroom caps everybody!"
"RORY: There's singing and mushroom caps."
"LORELAI: I am appalled by this."
"RORY: Sounds like a lot of fun."
"RICHARD: Oh, it is. Oh, now, your grandmother would come and say hello, but she's in the next room dancing with Lloyd Sandstone. Watch where you put those hands, Lloyd."
"RORY: A guy named Lloyd is feeling up Grandma."
"LORELAI: You're making this up."
"RORY: Well, um, I'll let you go, okay?"
"RICHARD: Okay. Now, you're coming to visit after school on Monday, aren't ya?"
"RORY: Yes, I'll see you then."
"RICHARD: Ah, can't wait. Bye now."
"[they hang up]"
"RORY: The Gilmore house is partying like it's 1999."
"LORELAI: And here it's ""At Home with The 700 Club."""
"RORY: Well, we didn't tell them to stop living their lives."
"LORELAI: How could they bounce back so quickly?"
"RORY: I don't know, but bounce they did."
"LORELAI: Okay, they win this time. But we've gotta think of something super big and fantastic and cool for next Friday night, okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Now think."
"RORY: Mushroom caps sound really good."
"LORELAI: Sh."
"RORY: Sorry."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is sitting at the counter playing with her camera. Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Say cheese. [takes a picture] I love my little digital camera. I wanna marry it."
"RORY: Do you ever wanna put it away?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you'll hurt little DigitalDan's feelings."
"RORY: Sorry, D.D."
"LORELAI: [takes another picture] Gotcha! Oh, no, wait. Oh, missed. [to customer next to Rory] Got a good one of you, though. Nice cheekbones."
"RORY: So, could you focus on something non-photographic for a second?"
"LORELAI: Aw, I'll try."
"RORY: I was asked to pass this along to you. [hands Lorelai an envelope]"
"LORELAI: Something from Chilton? You've been dipping girls' hair in the inkwells again?"
"RORY: Read it and see."
"LORELAI: [reads letter] ""Dear Ms. Gilmore, with your daughter's final days of Chilton fast approaching, yours are, too."" Hm, not feeling the love here. Yadda, yadda, yadda. ""The Booster Club could use your help. We would greatly appreciate - "" Greatly's underlined three times. Trying to emphasize the word there. Got it, guys. Thanks. "" - your involvement, especially in light of your previous paucity of participation."" Ooh, they got me with alliteration and an obscure word."
"RORY: The bastards."
"LORELAI: I've been summoned to duty."
"RORY: Sounds like it."
"LORELAI: I feel like I should pack my rucksack, kiss my loved ones goodbye."
"RORY: So, don't do it, then."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you're as good as outta there. Yale's grabbed you. It's too late. We don't need anything from Chilton."
"RORY: Except my graduation tickets."
"LORELAI: We already got 'em."
"RORY: But we need extras. I just put in the request, and it's up to them now."
"LORELAI: So we do need one kind of big thing."
"RORY: And then there's my diploma."
"LORELAI: You'll get your diploma at graduation."
"RORY: No, I get my diploma holder at graduation."
"LORELAI: Do you think they would withhold your diploma based on my participation paucity?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Oh man, I'm screwed. I guess I gotta do it."
"[Luke walks over]"
"LUKE: Hey guys."
"[Lorelai takes a picture of him]"
"LUKE: Was that necessary?"
"LORELAI: Oh man, you do not photograph well."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: You've been getting some sleep, brother? 'Cause that's forty miles bad running."
"LUKE: I wasn't ready. Plus, it was a bad angle. Plus, this is a harsh light. A soft light would help with the thing with the eyes."
"LORELAI: Look who knows what light he looks best in."
"LUKE: You ready to order?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna take a picture of the menu and then order off the camera."
"LUKE: Yell when she's tired of the thing."
"RORY: Give it time."
"LORELAI: Now I'm gonna zoom in on just the breakfast meats."
"RORY: Go to town."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S GARAGE"
"[The band is practicing. Rory and Jess are watching]"
"ZACH: Whoa, cool."
"DAVE: We all finished at the same time."
"LANE: That has never happened."
"BRIAN: The middle of that song didn't even sound like us."
"DAVE: Yeah, it sounded good."
"RORY: It sounded great, guys. All of it. Didn't it?"
"JESS: Not too shabby."
"DAVE: We are so ready for this gig."
"LANE: We've got a gig. I just love the sound of that."
"JESS: Where is it?"
"LANE: Kyle from school. His parents are going to Marriage Encounter for the weekend so he's throwing this mondo party."
"JESS: You got enough songs?"
"DAVE: We have enough for two half-hour sets. What we need is a name."
"BRIAN: I made my suggestion."
"ZACH: Yeah, and we vetoed ""The Harry Potters."" Next."
"BRIAN: So yours is better?"
"ZACH: ""Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert"" is memorable and classy."
"BRIAN: I run out of breath every time I say it."
"ZACH: You've got asthma, dude. You run out of breath saying your name."
"DAVE: Yeah, Brian, we can't work our name around your respiratory illnesses."
"BRIAN: Even without an inhaler, ""Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert"" is too long."
"ZACH: Yeah, but when we get famous, our fans will shorten it to FTTTEOTD."
"DAVE: Do you guys have any suggestions?"
"RORY: Oh, we wouldn't dare."
"BRIAN: Hey Lane, how are you gonna play a party like this with your mom being so strict?"
"LANE: Easy. Rory and Jess are gonna deliver my drums to Kyle's house for me, then my friend Young Chui is going to pick me up to take me to a fictional Seventh Day Adventist bowling party that will conveniently last the length of our gig."
"ZACH: Nice going."
"BRIAN: I've got my own ball and shoes."
"ZACH: Dude, don't tell people that."
"RORY: See you guys."
"JESS: Yeah, see ya."
"BAND: Bye."
"BRIAN: How about ""The We""?"
"ZACH: We?"
"BRIAN: Yeah. We are ""The We."""
"ZACH: I can't talk about this anymore."
"[Rory and Jess walk out of the garage]"
"RORY: So, any word on your car?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"RORY: You'd think someone would've found it. It was pretty one of a kind."
"JESS: It's probably holed up in some chop shop. Say goodbye, it's gone. Whatever. Let's talk about something else."
"RORY: I like that you're getting to know Dave a little."
"JESS: Yeah, he's a cool guy."
"RORY: Good. It's going to make the four of us going to prom together even more fun."
"JESS: Ah, yes, I almost forgot about the prom."
"RORY: No, you were trying to forget about the prom."
"JESS: I agreed to go and I am a man of my word."
"RORY: How's that arm I twisted?"
"JESS: I got the feeling back in it."
"RORY: It's just if there was one more dance I wanna go to in my whole life, it'd be the Stars Hollow High prom, with Lane. That's a big part of it."
"JESS: I'm getting the tickets this week."
"RORY: And I'll pay, okay?"
"JESS: Not a chance."
"RORY: It means a tux, you know. I know it's geeky."
"JESS: Tuxes are also James Bond. That's not geeky."
"RORY: You're kind."
"JESS: And going to stash a change of clothes in the limo."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Luke is on the floor examining the wall behind the stove as Sookie looks on. Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: I need love and a hug. I just had to lay off Julio."
"SOOKIE: Oh, poor thing."
"LORELAI: That's the third one today. All I'm doing is crushing people's spirits."
"SOOKIE: But you told them that we all love them and will hire them back as soon as all the repairs are done."
"LORELAI: And I gave them their severance checks and they were all very gracious, which made it that much harder."
"SOOKIE: We're gonna get 'em back. It'll all be good again."
"LORELAI: I had to lay off Frank, too, but I just couldn't do another one, so Michel offered to do it."
"SOOKIE: Did he say he'd be nice?"
"LORELAI: Yes, and then he skipped off to do it."
"SOOKIE: Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: So, what's going on with Luke here?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. I've been keeping my distance because of what happened."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"SOOKIE: Well, he was lying on the floor pretty much like that, tinkering with stuff back there, and I got down and leaned in to see what he was doing, and after a while, I realized that the whole time, my hand was on his butt."
"LORELAI: Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: It was an accident."
"LORELAI: It's getting very Cinemax at night in here."
"SOOKIE: It was embarrassing."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. So, how was it?"
"SOOKIE: His butt?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: It's got a nice shape to it."
"LUKE: Will you two stop talking about my butt?"
"LORELAI: It's all positive."
"LUKE: And in bad taste."
"[Luke walks over to them]"
"LORELAI: We'll just talk about it after you leave."
"LUKE: Which is now, because I'm done."
"LORELAI: So what's the prognosis?"
"LUKE: It's the same as what the stove company told you. The wall back here is b*rned from the fire. You're gonna have to rebuild the whole thing before you can even think of reconnecting the gas. It's gonna take awhile, sorry."
"LORELAI: No, Luke, thanks for doing this. It's exactly what the contractor said. We just wanted a guy with a good butt's opinion."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, Tom has a terrible butt."
"LUKE: Please stop that."
"LORELAI: So Rory and I will see you Saturday for breakfast?"
"LUKE: Actually, you won't. Nicole and I are going skiing and we're getting a ridiculously early start."
"LORELAI: That sounds fun. Why ridiculously early?"
"LUKE: Because she has to drive in from her place in New York first because she can't stay at my place because of Jess."
"LORELAI: Hey, if you want, why don't you have her come in Friday night, you guys can stay here at the inn. It'll be on the house."
"LUKE: Nah, that's okay."
"LORELAI: No, do it, Luke. I mean, I know we have rooms available, and it's my way of saying thanks for parading that nice butt around here."
"LUKE: Geez."
"LORELAI: No kidding, really, it's a great butt."
"LUKE: Stop it."
"LORELAI: No, really, it's no problem."
"LUKE: Well, I don't know, maybe. Either way, thank for the offer."
"LORELAI: All right. I'll tell Michel to keep a room available in case you decide to do it."
"LUKE: Okay. See ya."
"LORELAI: Thanks, bye."
"[Luke leaves, Michel walks in]"
"MICHEL: Did you know that Frank rescues Chow puppies?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"MICHEL: He feeds and houses them on his own dime 'til he finds an owner. We can't fire him. And they are so cute. [shows her a picture] Chin-Chin and Pau-Pau. Pau-Pau's the one with the squatty little nose. I took them both."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay, good job."
"MICHEL: I have to go buy dog food. Will you fire Frank for me?"
"LORELAI: Sure thing."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Lorelai is at a Booster Club meeting]"
"TERRY: With that last function, we raised just enough to put us in the black, which got the school controller off our back, which is going to make our last endeavor that much easier."
"CARRIE: Haven't we already talked all this stuff to death?"
"TERRY: Yes, but we need to fill in our last minute Booster Club add-ons here."
"LORELAI: You get the scary threatening letter?"
"DOUG: Yup."
"TERRY: So, onto Grad Night, our last event of the year."
"JOAN: God, this year's gone by fast."
"CARRIE: I can't believe my Farrah's eighteen."
"DOUG: My kid was eighteen was she was ten."
"CARRIE: Men."
"DOUG: What?"
"LORELAI: Lay low, Doug. They're setting traps. So, um, what are we doing this year?"
"TERRY: We're throwing a big party on a yacht."
"LORELAI: Fun."
"TERRY: The party starts while it's in dock, then it sails for three hours and concludes with a fireworks show."
"CARRIE: How's the fundraising going?"
"TERRY: Terrific. The last fashion show alone brought in half of what we need, and the bake sale today brought in way more than I expected. Oh, that reminds me. [pushes a box toward Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"TERRY: Our cash box. You are the Grad Night treasurer."
"LORELAI: I'm the what?"
"TERRY: Before you got here, we took a little vote and you won."
"LORELAI: Well, uh, maybe there should be a recount 'cause I stink with money."
"TERRY: The vote was unanimous."
"LORELAI: I was late, can we revote?"
"CARRIE: Doug was late, too, and he was voted lead chaperone."
"DOUG: Goody."
"LORELAI: Come on, we can take 'em."
"CARRIE: It's really not a tough job, Lorelai. You just manage the cash, keep the simple books, it's easy."
"TERRY: Although, it does mean if you don't show up at our next meeting, we're going to assume you ran off with our money."
"LORELAI: No, no, I wouldn't do that."
"[Max walks into the cafeteria]"
"MAX: Hello, ladies. Hope I'm not too late. Oh, and gentleman, sorry."
"CARRIE: Oh, Doug's one of the ladies now."
"MAX: Well, good to see you all. Terry, Carrie. Lorelai, good to see you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, good, same here."
"MAX: So, what'd I miss?"
"TERRY: Nothing much. Lorelai's been made our Grad Night treasurer."
"MAX: You up to the challenge?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I'll watch the little box here."
"MAX: And let me guess, other than that, they've been picking on you mercilessly."
"DOUG: Pretty much."
"MAX: Well, I'm here to lend you gender support, my friend. So, Terry, why don't you continue?"
"TERRY: Great. We were discussing Grad Night."
"MAX: The yacht. Sounds great."
"TERRY: Now, we've already spoken to six caterers, they're all excited to bid on the project, but a couple are so expensive that I know they'll price themselves out of the running."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorela and Sookie are walking through the town square]"
"SOOKIE: Weird. Very weird."
"LORELAI: It's as if we had no history. He treated me the same as he treated what's her name and the overly coifed lady and the one who kept jiggling her leg the whole time."
"SOOKIE: Ugh, I hate that."
"LORELAI: It's like an earthquake. And he was so nonchalant."
"SOOKIE: So, standoff-y?"
"LORELAI: No, he was just Max. And I wanted to hook up with after to talk, but very conveniently, he excused himself five minutes early for an appointment and I couldn't walk out early with him because I'm the stupid treasurer and it would look fishy."
"SOOKIE: They made you treasurer. Are they insane?"
"LORELAI: I tried to tell them. And what's with this appointment nonsense? And no eye contact."
"SOOKIE: You mean he never once looked at you?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he looked, but it was very lacking in meaning."
"SOOKIE: Were you looking at him meaningfully?"
"LORELAI: No. I was trying to play it cool."
"SOOKIE: Well, there you go. He was doing the same thing. You were both James Dean-ing it, trying to keep it professional."
"LORELAI: No, he was not playing at it, I was. He was really it."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Cool."
"SOOKIE: Got it."
"LORELAI: So. . ."
"SOOKIE: Maybe you two never kissed."
"LORELAI: Me and Max? Oh no, we kissed."
"SOOKIE: Maybe it was an illusion."
"LORELAI: It was not an illusion, Doug Henning. We kissed."
"SOOKIE: Don't be so sure because something like this happened to me when I was like ten. I was so into Leif Garrett and I fantasized about kissing him so much that at some point, I really thought it happened."
"LORELAI: I kissed Max, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: I can still feel Leif's lips on mine."
"LORELAI: I kissed him."
"SOOKIE: Well, what is Rory's take on all this?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I told her about the kiss at first, but it's weird. I mean, he's back at Chilton and I'm back having some sort of involvement with her teacher. She's dealing with finals and everything. I don't wanna stress her out about this."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai, what's the ultimate thing here? Do you wanna get back together with him?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I don't know what I'm feeling or what I'm looking for these days, and I hate that. 'Cause it's so wishy-washy, but it's true. I mean, technically, I'm still seeing Alex, although it's more intermittent than ever. I'm not even sure I wanna get back together with Max. The kiss just happened out of the blue."
"SOOKIE: The alleged kiss."
"LORELAI: Sookie, we kissed."
"SOOKIE: Okay, calm down."
"LORELAI: If I knew where Max was on all this, I would know better where I was. It's like when you go to a steak and lobster place, it's easier to know what you want once you know what your date wants. Like, you want steak if he's getting lobster, 'cause then you can share. Or if he's not, you can get surf and turf, though you risk looking like a pig, but some guys aren't turned on by a big appetite, and now I'm not just confused, I'm massively hungry."
"SOOKIE: Me, too. Maybe lunch will take your mind off it a bit."
"LORELAI: Hope so."
"SOOKIE: Are you sure there was really an Alex?"
"LORELAI: Stop."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[The principal is in his office. There's a knock at the door]"
"PRINCIPAL: Come in."
"[Jess opens the door]"
"PRINCIPAL: Well, well. Jess Mariano. What a pleasure. Sit down."
"JESS: I was just trying to buy prom tickets and they told me to go see you."
"PRINCIPAL: Sit down. So, the prom, huh? I wouldn't have taken you for someone who'd wanna go to the prom."
"JESS: My girlfriend wants to."
"PRINCIPAL: Oh, that's too bad."
"JESS: What, why?"
"PRINCIPAL: Because you flunked out."
"JESS: I what?"
"PRINCIPAL: You're not graduating, Jess. Prom tickets are for graduating seniors only. Guess your girlfriend's outta luck."
"JESS: Now wait a minute. I'm just a little behind. I can catch up, no sweat."
"PRINCIPAL: You can't, you missed too much."
"JESS: It hasn't been that much."
"PRINCIPAL: Thirty-one days you've been out. Cutoff's twenty."
"JESS: So that's it, just like that?"
"PRINCIPAL: That's it."
"JESS: Thanks for the warning."
"PRINCIPAL: You mean the nine warning slips we gave you weren't enough? All the meetings that I tried to set up between you and your guidance counselor, between you and me that you blew off, that wasn't warning enough?"
"JESS: I can catch up, I'm smarter than anyone here."
"PRINCIPAL: And humble, too."
"JESS: I can catch up, you'll see."
"PRINCIPAL: There's nothing to see, you're out."
"JESS: Fine, I'll take summer school if that's what you want."
"PRINCIPAL: Good, but it's not enough. You have to take the whole year over."
"JESS: The whole year? No way."
"PRINCIPAL: Then no diploma."
"JESS: At least let me go to the prom, what's the big deal?"
"PRINCIPAL: We're done here."
"JESS: Come on."
"PRINCIPAL: You wanna talk about coming back next year, my door's open."
"JESS: I'm not gonna miss this place."
"PRINCIPAL: Vice versa."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks to the living room where Rory is getting ready to leave]"
"LORELAI: No, no, it's impossible."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I just counted the money in the cash box and I'm eighteen dollars short."
"RORY: Weren't you supposed to deposit all that at the bank?"
"LORELAI: Uh, be judgmental later. Help me in my fiscal crisis here."
"RORY: Did you count the money when they gave it to you?"
"LORELAI: Ah, I glanced at it."
"RORY: Boy, you are a sucky treasurer."
"LORELAI: The job was forced on me."
"RORY: Well, the cash box must've been short when you got it."
"LORELAI: Or maybe a burglar broke in here. That could've happened."
"RORY: A burglar who bypassed out TV, our stereo, and our jewelry and went straight for the Booster Club cash box and took eighteen dollars and left the rest?"
"LORELAI: Some burglars are less greedy than others."
"RORY: Well, I'm out of answers."
"LORELAI: Great. I'm gonna have to put eighteen of my own dollars in to ward off suspicion. You're off to the party this early?"
"RORY: Jess and I are helping the band set up. I do the cymbals."
"LORELAI: You're not taking your purse."
"RORY: I'm not?"
"LORELAI: You don't need money, you don't need ID."
"RORY: Well, where will I keep my house key?"
"LORELAI: You'll put your house key through the metal thingy on your belt. You'll only lose it if you take off your belt, and if you're taking off your belt for any reason at the party, I'm not sure I want you coming home."
"RORY: Brilliant."
"LORELAI: Uh, your shoes okay? You got good traction?"
"RORY: Traction?"
"LORELAI: Well, there'll be liquids of various textures and disgustingness. You eating there?"
"RORY: Oh, if they have stuff."
"LORELAI: Do not eat chips out of a communal bowl. You might as well stick your hand in a toilet."
"RORY: Nice."
"LORELAI: If you're desperate, offer to be the person who replenishes them with new bags and grab a handful out of the new bag and dump the rest in the communal bowl."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: And keep in mind that getting up on a table and performing a song of any kind will haunt you for the rest of your life. Trust me. Been there, done that."
"RORY: I wasn't planning on doing that."
"LORELAI: Hm, those things are never planned. You going now?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: I'm going, too. I'll lock it up."
"RORY: Otherwise I'd have to undo my belt. Enjoy your Booster Club meeting."
"LORELAI: I will. Hey, hon?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: I promised myself I wasn't gonna ask you about Max anymore considering the history and that he's back teaching you and all. . .and I'm gonna keep my promise. Good, huh?"
"RORY: Very good."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, that's all I wanted to say."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they both leave]"
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[The band is setting up before the party]"
"DAVE: Does this set up feel right to everybody?"
"LANE: Cool by me."
"BRIAN: Me, too."
"DAVE: How's it look out there?"
"RORY: Like you're gonna b*llet straight to the top of the charts, with a b*llet or a - a g*n's gonna sh**t a b*llet, and I'm not, uh, familiar with the precise terminology, but it's working, right?"
"JESS: They look like a band to me."
"ZACH: You need to move back more."
"BRIAN: Why?"
"ZACH: Because when I do my double jump kick off the amp with slashing windmills, I'm gonna need more room."
"LANE: Well, don't do that then."
"DAVE: Yeah, sounds a little too Milli Vanilli, Zach."
"BRIAN: And if I back up anymore, my extension cord might damage the miniature date palm."
"LANE: The what?"
"BRIAN: It's what that's called. My aunt's got one."
"ZACH: Dude, don't call plants by their specific names, it's very not rock and roll."
"DAVE: Let's finalize the set list, guys."
"[Rory walks over to Kyle, who is putting breakable objects away in a box]"
"RORY: Need any help hiding the valuables, Kyle?"
"KYLE: Nope. We stashed the snow globes, hid the Lladros, now we're just packing up the Hummels."
"MARSHALL: Two to go."
"KYLE: Marshall, watch it! Boy with Toothache is mom's favorite."
"MARSHALL: Sorry."
"KYLE: Hey, did I hear the singer say something about a double jump kick?"
"RORY: We'll talk him out of it."
"KYLE: Good."
"MARSHALL: Zealous Xylophonist, that's sweet."
"DAVE: Starting off with a slow tune won't work, Brian."
"ZACH: Yeah, man, it's so emo, it makes me sick."
"BRIAN: I was just playing devil's advocate."
"DAVE: Devil's advocate."
"ZACH: Not a bad name."
"[Two boys enter the house with a keg]"
"BOYS: Keg!"
"KYLE: That's my cousin Rick. He just turned twenty-one. Pretty awesome."
"RICK: Twenty-one, yeah!"
"LANE: What is that, beer?"
"ZACH: No, it's one of those milk kegs."
"BRIAN: Good one."
"LANE: There's beer, is that legal?"
"DAVE: Well, apparently Rick is twenty-one."
"RICK: Twenty-one, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!"
"DAVE: Or just really into that particular integer."
"LANE: Beer."
"ZACH: It's a party, Lane. What were you expecting, Tang?"
"LANE: No, I guess not."
"KYLE: The carpet, guys. Lift it, lift it."
"RICK: Oh, we got it."
"KYLE: Marshall, go get towels to set it on. And not the good towels, the swim towels."
"[Young Chui walks up to the band]"
"YOUNG CHUI: Anything I can help you with, guys?"
"DAVE: Uh, we got it covered. Thanks, Young Chui."
"YOUNG CHUI: How about you, Lane? You need water or anything?"
"DAVE: Uh, Young Chui, you should probably stay away from the band area. We got a lot of cords and stuff, and I don't want you to get electrocuted and die."
"YOUNG CHUI: Oh, okay. [walks away]"
"DAVE: So, is he staying for the whole thing?"
"LANE: He's got nowhere else to go."
"KYLE: These are the good towels."
"MARSHALL: These are the swim towels."
"KYLE: The swim towels have stripes and they're oversized. Now, come on, hurry. We still have to put away my dad's military icon collector plates."
"JESS: We're here a little early, don't you think?"
"RORY: No, we're with the band. We're the roadies and the sound crew and I'm advising on makeup for Lane and I'm the keeper of Brian's sandwich and thermos. So we're busy backstage-type people."
"JESS: We're dork-early."
"RORY: Come on, get into the spirit of things. Hello Cleveland!"
"JESS: Guess I'll wander around a little."
"[Zach jumps off the amp and knocks over the microphone]"
"DAVE: And you couldn't even work your slashing windmills in."
"ZACH: Yeah, maybe I'll skip it."
"DAVE: Good thinking."

"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks past a group of guests and over to Michel at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Uh, Michel, are you okay?"
"MICHEL: Do I look okay?"
"LORELAI: Are those people waiting for a bellman?"
"MICHEL: No, they're waiting for a unicorn to sing to a rainbow. Yes, a bellman. But there's only one because we had to lay off the others. And a maid called in sick, so not only am I dealing with answering phones and checking people in and out, but I'm going to have to do turn down service and carry people's bags to their rooms and. . ."
"LORELAI: You're going to a bad place. Now just take a breath and go to a good place."
"MICHEL: Plus, I had to run home and play with my Chow puppies because the Chow book said they need love and stimulation or else they'll m*rder you later on. And Pau-Pau had fallen in her water bowl and was soaking wet so I had to blow dry her and. . ."
"LORELAI: Okay, the nice place, and I can stay and help a little bit, okay?"
"MICHEL: She could've drowned. I'm a bad daddy."
"LORELAI: Pau-Pau's fine. Just watch the desk, get the bellman back here. I'll do turn down."
"MICHEL: [to guest checking in] Have you ever seen Chow puppies? You want to eat them up."
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks up to Jess]"
"RORY: They're getting ready to go on. They're all hyperventilating to the same rhythm, so that's a positive sign. What are you looking at?"
"JESS: The happy family. Kinda depressing if you ask me."
"RORY: Oh, Mr. Sunshine. You're spreading so much joy around, you're embarrassing yourself. You've got to get a little more moody."
"JESS: I'll try."
"RORY: Let's look around a little bit."
"JESS: Okay. [they walk past a crying girl] Seems a little early for that."
"RORY: It never is."
"JESS: Bathroom line."
"RORY: Figures."
"[they walk into the kitchen; some boys are standing around the keg]"
"JESS: Hey. What's up with you guys?"
"KYLE: Stupid keg."
"MARSHALL: It's not working."
"JESS: Where's the tap?"
"KYLE: The what?"
"JESS: It's a keg, it's sealed. You need to hook up a tap to pump the beer out."
"KYLE: I told you the thing in the bag did something."
"RICK: [pulls the tap out of a bag] No instructions."
"JESS: Jeez. [he attaches the tap to the keg] There, start pumping."
"MARSHALL: All right. To Jess!"
"KYLE: To Jess."
"RICK: To Jess."
"JESS: Yeah."
"KYLE: Yeah."
"RORY: You and Springsteen, the working man's hero."
"[they walk up to the band]"
"RORY: You ready to go on, guys?"
"DAVE: Only if Brian rallies."
"RORY: What's wrong, Brian?"
"BRIAN: I don't feel good."
"DAVE: It's his heartburn again."
"ZACH: I told you, dude, it's your citrus intake. Stop eating oranges."
"[Lane walks up to Rory]"
"LANE: Rory. Uh, you've gotta do me a big favor."
"RORY: Name it."
"LANE: Young Chui's driving me crazy."
"RORY: What do you want me to do?"
"LANE: Uh, if you see any unattached girls who you think would go for a very available, uh, needy, self-delusional guy, send 'em Young Chui's way."
"RORY: I'll keep a lookout."
"DAVE: Lane."
"LANE: Oh my God, this is it."
"RORY: Knock 'em dead."
"DAVE: Brian, you with us?"
"BRIAN: I have completely forgotten how to play the bass."
"ZACH: Perfect."
"DAVE: Brian, you're just nervous. Take a deep breath and use your inhaler."
"ZACH: Yeah, and don't forget that the hair and fingernails on John Entwistle's body were still growing when they brought in his replacement."
"BRIAN: You're gonna replace me?"
"DAVE: We're not gonna replace you. Just relax and let the music flow through you."
"RICK: Come on, let's go!"
"GIRL: Yeah, come on - rock and roll!"
"LANE: Zach, start."
"DAVE: Wait, wait, someone's gotta introduce us. Rory, introduce us."
"RORY: Me? Why me?"
"RICK: Come on, let's go!"
"MARSHALL: Yeah, crank it!"
"DAVE: Go, go."
"RORY: All right. Uh, now, who wants to hear some tunes? [the crowd cheers] Okay, good, there's a consensus. Here they are, Stars Hollow's rockingest band. Although they're not all from Stars Hollow, but they, um, they practice there, so we kind of consider them our own. Here they are. . .[to the band] What's your name?"
"ZACH: ""Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert."""
"DAVE: ""The Chops."" ""Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert."""
"ZACH: ""The Chops."""
"[Rory mumbles into the microphone and walks away. The crowd cheers and the band starts playing]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai knocks on a guest room door]"
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Turn down."
"LUKE: Come on in."
"[Lorelai walks into the room]"
"LORELAI: Hello there. This won't take long. Luke."
"LUKE: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What are you doing here?"
"LUKE: You invited us, remember?"
"LORELAI: Us?"
"[Nicole walks out of the bathroom]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. Hi Nicole. There's the ""us""."
"NICOLE: Hi, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I don't usually do this turn down service. I mean, I did when I started many moons ago, but that's when I was a maid. Wow, you guys are here."
"LUKE: You didn't know?"
"LORELAI: No. I mean, I remember inviting you. It's great that you're here. Um, but when I told Michel I would do the turn down service, it must've slipped his mind that you were here. Pau-Pau fell in her water dish."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Never mind. I'll just do this and get out of your way."
"LUKE: Hey, you don't have to."
"NICOLE: Yeah, Lorelai, really, we can do all this."
"LORELAI: No, you are our guests and you deserve to get what you're paying for."
"LUKE: We're not paying."
"LORELAI: No, no, but this is where you start paying - in sweat."
"LUKE: What?"
"NICOLE: Fame, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Debbie Allen. In sweat. I just loved how she said that. Let's see. . .uh, you need towels."
"LUKE: You can just give 'em to me."
"LORELAI: Okay, here are your towels. And, let me see. . . oh, I'll draw your curtains closed. What else, what else? It's been a little while since I've done this. Oh, do you want a fire?"
"LUKE: I don't know. Nicole?"
"NICOLE: Uh, a fire would be nice."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll light it for you. We have these new log bags now, makes it real easy. Uh, okay. [tries to light the fireplace] So, nothing like a fire on a cold night like this, huh?"
"LUKE: Mm."
"LORELAI: Hm, I'm not having much luck here. And, uh, you know what, we laid off the person who was able to light these things no problem, now we can't light these things, and ironically we laid him off because of a fire."
"LUKE: It's okay, forget it. I can light it."
"LORELAI: Okay. What else, let's see. Oh, um, well, turn down. I need to turn down the bed."
"LUKE: Really, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: No, no, no. Up, up, up. Okay, I'll get ya all settled here, nice and comfy. Great lines with these covers here. Pillows, nice and plump. And a couple of pillow mints. There you go, now you're all ready to. . .uh, you're all ready for your evening."
"LUKE: Fine, good, that's good."
"NICOLE: Yes, great, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, you're all set. Just call if you need anything, and have fun."
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[The band finishes up a song and the crowd cheers]"
"DAVE: Okay, thanks. Uh, we're gonna take a short break and then we'll be back."
"RORY: Guys, that was amazing. Really, it was awesome."
"DAVE: Thanks."
"ZACH: Dude, you did good, you really did. But you got a little too close to me when you were singing into the mike."
"BRIAN: I got as close as I had to."
"ZACH: Your nose touched my cheek, man. That's too close."
"LANE: Guys, come on, just be happy. We played and we didn't suck, right?"
"DAVE: Yeah, it was good."
"KYLE: Come on, let's spread the word. All drinks on coasters, please."
"MARSHALL: Hey, the coasters are there to be used."
"LANE: Dave, what's wrong? I mean, we totally rocked."
"DAVE: We sounded great."
"LANE: Then what is it?"
"DAVE: It's this Young Chui thing. It's driving me crazy."
"LANE: Why?"
"DAVE: Why? Lane, when are you. . .when are you gonna break up with him?"
"LANE: It's complicated. Young Chui's very sensitive right now."
"DAVE: I'm sorry, but I don't care."
"LANE: If you got to know him, you'd understand."
"DAVE: I don't want to get to know him. I just want him to do his part and break up with you so that I can take you to your prom. He's acting like he's in love with you or something."
"LANE: Well. . ."
"DAVE: Oh, no. Is he?"
"LANE: Kind of."
"DAVE: Kind of?"
"LANE: Apparently, totally."
"DAVE: Young Chui is in love with you and that's why he won't break up with you, so that he gets to take you to your prom. And he knows that your mom likes him and that we're running out of time."
"LANE: No, we're not out of time."
"DAVE: The prom's in two weeks."
"LANE: I'll make it happen, I swear."
"DAVE: It's too late. I'll see you for the next set. [walks away]"
"LANE: Dave."
"[cut to Rory and Jess]"
"JESS: So, what now?"
"RORY: What do you mean, what now?"
"JESS: Let's go, let's get out of here."
"RORY: Go where?"
"JESS: Anywhere."
"RORY: It's early."
"JESS: It's boring."
"RORY: Jess, we can't just go."
"JESS: Yes, we can."
"RORY: The band's playing a whole other set."
"JESS: They can do it without us."
"RORY: I don't wanna leave. Now, come on, try to have fun. Talk, mingle."
"JESS: I don't wanna talk to anybody else. I don't like anybody else."
"RORY: I don't wanna leave. I need to stay here for Lane, come on. Gloomy."
"JESS: We'll go right when they get done playing, okay?"
"RORY: Sure, Grandpa."
"JESS: Rory."
"RORY: We'll go then, I promise."
"KYLE: Hey, you drop a chip, you pick it up. It's common courtesy folks."
"CUT TO LATER AT THE PARTY"
"[Rory and Jess run into Dean and Lindsay]"
"RORY: Hi guys."
"DEAN: Hey."
"LINDSAY: Hey."
"RORY: So, Lindsay, what did you think of Lane's band?"
"LINDSAY: I liked 'em. Although I didn't recognize most of the songs."
"DEAN: She's not a music freak like you."
"RORY: Well, we all can't be freaks."
"DEAN: True."
"RORY: So what kind of music do you like?"
"LINDSAY: I don't know. . .uh, Michelle Branch, Matchbox 20."
"JESS: Jeez."
"RORY: I like them, too. I mean, I like all kinds of things."
"LINDSAY: You used to go to our school."
"RORY: He still goes."
"DEAN: Really? I haven't seen you around much."
"JESS: What are you, the attendance monitor? I'm gonna go see what the hell's holding up this line. [walks away]"
"RORY: He's not feeling well."
"LINDSAY: That's too bad."
"DEAN: Uh, well, we'll see you later."
"LINDSAY: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"[cut to Lane in another room]"
"MARSHALL: Hey, Lane. There's some guy looking for you."
"LANE: Good, where?"
"[he points across the room to Young Chui, who waves to Lane; Lane walks to the kitchen]"
"KYLE: Oh, oh, and the part where Gimli the Dwarf is riding his horse, then Legolas grabs the front straps and swings himself up on top of it."
"RICK: Dude, dude, that was awesome!"
"LANE: Any more left in that thing?"
"KYLE: Plenty. Foam or no foam?"
"LANE: Anything you hand me, Kyle, I'm downing."
"[he hands her a cup of beer and she takes a sip]"
"LANE: Very refreshing."
"KYLE: Oh, oh, and at the end when the tree is on fire and then he puts himself out in the flood. Oh!"
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Lorelai walks in for the Booster Club meeting]"
"LORELAI: Hi, sorry I'm late. Actually, I'm not late. I was right on time, but then I remembered I left the cash box in the car. I mean, I was not used to having to carry a cash box. So I went back and got it, and I was carrying it by the handle and the stupid thing flew open and money flew everywhere, and I may have lost eighteen bucks in the process. Anyway, here I am. So where's Doug?"
"TERRY: I believe we scared Doug away."
"CARRIE: I love scaring the Dougs away."
"JOAN: So, you were telling us about these ridiculous dock fees."
"TERRY: Right. We got what was supposed to be a final quote from the yacht owner, who then remembers he failed to mention an exorbitant dock fee."
"JOAN: Unbelievable."
"TERRY: And I don't wanna pay. I made some calls and I have several suggestions on how to get around it. Oh, but first, let me bring in a student from the senior class who wanted to give her own thoughts about the yacht trip. Come on in."
"[Paris walks into the cafeteria]"
"CARRIE: [quietly] Oh no."
"JOAN: [quietly] Paris Gellar."
"PARIS: Ladies, thank you for seeing me. I know you're busy with work and have families to get home to, so I really appreciate your courtesy, and I'll make it brief. Having Grad Night on a yacht is the worst idea since Neville Chamberlain told the people of England, ""Hey, don't worry about h*tler. He's a stand-up chap."" Forget the inconvenience of being at sea with guests unable to leave if the party is dull or if the band, which will inevitably be composed of accountants with semi-mullets, decides to do a half-hour tribute to Kenny G. The seasickness factor alone, abetted by snuck-in flasks and badly cooked food, could lead to an epidemic, which may lead to lawsuits the school could ill afford. These points conclusively call for a change in venue to a hotel ballroom, a restaurant facility, several of which I've already called. Here are the results of my research. I've also included a list of maritime disasters from the past fifty years -- capsizings, onboard fires, et cetera -- and trust me, it'll put you off your lunch. Thank you for your time and cooperation. [leaves]"
"TERRY: So, my thought is to discuss these yacht fees directly with the yacht owner first."
"JOAN: Absolutely."
"[a woman walks in]"
"BARBARA: Hello everyone, sorry I'm late."
"TERRY: Oh, that's okay."
"BARBARA: I'm Barbara Epstein, I teach drama, and I'll be your faculty rep tonight."
"TERRY: Welcome Barbara."
"BARBARA: I just left Max Medina, he filled me in on everything that you're doing here."
"TERRY: Good, then we'll get a running start. We're dealing with a fee that we do not wanna pay for this yacht."
"LORELAI: Keep going, girls. I just need. . .um, I'll be right back."
"TERRY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Joan, you gotta watch the cash box."
"JOAN: Will do."
"[Lorelai leaves. In the hallway, she walks up to janitor]"
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry. Um, nearest bathroom? [he points] That way, huh? I'm gonna go this way. I think the farthest one is the one I'm looking for. I told a friend I'd meet her there, so I'll just go. . ."
"[she walks down the hall and sees Max inside a classroom. She opens the door.]"
"LORELAI: Gotcha."
"MAX: You sure did."
"LORELAI: Bad time?"
"MAX: Kind of."
"[she walks in]"
"LORELAI: Busy?"
"MAX: Real busy."
"LORELAI: You're avoiding me."
"MAX: No, I'm not."
"LORELAI: Then what's with the 'I'm busy' thing?"
"MAX: I can't be busy?"
"LORELAI: Ah, but that's avoiding me, saying you're busy."
"MAX: No, it's descriptive of my current state. These essays are due back tomorrow, I'm way behind on my reading, so I'm eating my day-old vending machine at my desk in my futile attempt to try and catch up."
"LORELAI: Two rotations."
"MAX: What?"
"LORELAI: It's in the Booster Club bylaws, my friend. I looked it up myself. Faculty advisors are supposed to do a minimum of two consecutive rotations with the Booster Club and you did only one."
"MAX: I did three."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MAX: I did three. You went to my third one. I did the previous two you weren't at."
"LORELAI: I'm assuming you have documentation?"
"MAX: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: With Lorelai Gilmore, it's trust but verify."
"MAX: Well, I'm sure I can scrounge up a witness."
"LORELAI: Why did you treat me so weird at that last meeting?"
"MAX: I treated you with respect and kindness."
"LORELAI: That's why it was weird. It's how you treated Terry and Joan, too. I mean, did you also kiss Terry and Joan?"
"MAX: Yeah, I did. And Doug. He was the best of the three."
"LORELAI: Max."
"MAX: I was playing it cool. You were, too. I was just following suit."
"LORELAI: No, I was playing it cool because you were playing it cool. And I'm the treasurer and the treasurer has to be cool or it just looks suspicious."
"MAX: Wait, wait, wait. Ten feet."
"LORELAI: Ten feet?"
"MAX: That's a safe distance for us, and the more furniture in between, the better."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna attack you."
"MAX: I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about me. I mean, there are people still walking the halls and this is my workplace and I can't be held responsible for what I do around you. I mean, you are like a - like a - like a mythological creature that casts some kind of spell on me and makes me act stupid. I'm not stupid. I don't act stupid with anyone else. Uh, we're too close again."
"LORELAI: Okay, I didn't bring a frickin' tape measure. I'm not good at judging distances. You'll have to help me out with the ten feet thing."
"MAX: Well, it's a little bigger than a basketball player. Just keep a really big basketball player between us."
"LORELAI: Wow, I bet there's a sentence that's never been uttered before."
"MAX: There are other complications with this whole thing, you know. Just thought I'd tell you."
"LORELAI: What other complications?"
"MAX: I was seeing someone in California. There, I said it."
"LORELAI: You mean, you weren't living like a Trappist monk while you were in California? I'm shocked."
"MAX: That doesn't bother you?"
"LORELAI: Max, we weren't together. I mean, I have been seeing someone, too."
"MAX: Well, I would probably still be seeing Diane if I hadn't moved back here. That's something to think about."
"LORELAI: So you can't date anyone for the rest of your life because if you'd stayed in California, which you didn't, you might still be dating Diane?"
"MAX: Yes. No. Ugh!"
"LORELAI: Do you want an aspirin? I probably have a. . .Tic Tac. Sorry, I shouldn't have teased you with that aspirin thing."
"MAX: You know, I thought we were both going to just pretend to ignore the kiss. Wasn't that the deal?"
"LORELAI: We had a deal? I don't remember a deal."
"MAX: You had your sh*t, okay? You had the ring and you said no."
"LORELAI: Yes, I did. And you said that that was right for you, too. You went to Stanford, you dated Diane, it was right for both of us."
"MAX: Well, what is this, now, right here?"
"LORELAI: It's us. Tada."
"MAX: Well, us needs to stay apart."
"LORELAI: Oh, Max, we had a whole country between us for a year. That's like eleven-thousand basketball players lying end to end, and yet, here we are. We can't avoid each other."
"MAX: I thought I was over you. I thought it was safe to come back here, but no, not the deal. I just, I think we should stay apart and never see each other ever again."
"LORELAI: That's impossible."
"MAX: No, it's not."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll be at the Chilton graduation and so will you."
"MAX: Well, I'll sit behind a tree."
"LORELAI: We could run into each other at a drugstore again."
"MAX: Well, I'm gonna order all my drugs online."
"LORELAI: If my car breaks down next to yours, will you stop?"
"MAX: I will stop, and keep my eyes straight forward, call a garage and then stay in my car with the radio on really loud 'til they come, and then I'm gone. And I say we start being apart right now."
"LORELAI: Okay. Whatever you want."
"MAX: This is what I want. And when I walk out that door, it could very well be the last time we see each other."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll abide by your wishes."
"MAX: Goodbye, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Goodbye, Max."
"[Max leaves the classroom and walks down the hall. As he walks by the other door from the classroom, Lorelai walks out and bumps into him.]"
"LORELAI: You said you were leaving."
"MAX: My car is that way."
"LORELAI: Well, I have to go that way, too."
"MAX: After you."
"LORELAI: Two seconds, we've already run into each other."
"MAX: Doesn't count."
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks over to Young Chui]"
"RORY: Young Chui, have you seen Jess?"
"YOUNG CHUI: Uh, I think I saw him go upstairs. Have you seen Lane?"
"RORY: Not for awhile. She's probably with the band. Why don't you go see?"
"YOUNG CHUI: Oh, I don't wanna lose these seats."
"RORY: Right, right."
"[in the kitchen, Lane is refilling her beer, Kyle is on the phone]"
"KYLE: It's just me and Marshall, Mom, honest. . . okay, kiss Uncle Newtie for me. Bye. [hangs up]"
"LANE: Hey Kyle. Mind if I use your phone there?"
"KYLE: As long as it's local."
"LANE: Oh, it's local distance, yeah, don't worry."
"KYLE: Okay."
"[Lane picks up the phone and dials a number]"
"LANE: [on phone] Hello, Mama? Hi, how are you doing tonight?. . .It's Lane. Yeah, Lane. . . Nothing's wrong. In fact, I'm feeling pretty good right now. Had a beer and a half, nice cold beer. And I just thought I'd tell you, I'm drumming in a band tonight at a party and we rocked. We were The Clash and Rage Against the Machine and Nirvana combined. And I'm in love with Dave Rygalski. He's my guy, not Young Chui. Young Chui's a ship in the night, Mama. Not even a ship, he's a little tugboat tooting along and I'm not gonna go to the prom with him, unh uh. I'm going with Dave, because we rock together, Mama. The charade is over."
"[Dave walks in and hangs up the phone]"
"LANE: Hey."
"DAVE: What are you doing?"
"LANE: What I should've done months ago, Davey."
"DAVE: That was not your mother. Tell me that wasn't your mother."
"LANE: Oh, that was the mother. I am liberated, my friend."
"DAVE: You're drunk."
"LANE: No, I'm. . .am I?"
"DAVE: We're going on in five minutes. Can you even play?"
"LANE: Oh, I can hit the sticks on those brums."
"DAVE: Great, great, but what about the drums? [walks away]"
"LANE: Dave."
"[Rory walks upstairs and finds Jess sitting in an empty bedroom]"
"RORY: There you are."
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: I've been looking all over for you."
"JESS: Just got tired of everything down there."
"RORY: Are we allowed to be up here? I mean, Kyle was kind of discouraging it."
"JESS: When you have a party, you get what you get."
"RORY: Yeah, I guess. Sad boy, what's wrong? You were looking forward to this party, what happened?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"RORY: Something did. Come on, tell me. [they kiss] You're not tired of me, are you? [they kiss again] That's a pretty good answer."
"[They kiss again, then start making out on the bed]"
"RORY: Jess, wait. . . Jess, wait. . . Jess. [jumps up off the bed]"
"JESS: Jeez."
"RORY: Not here, not now."
"JESS: Fine."
"RORY: What's wrong with you?"
"JESS: Nothing's wrong with me."
"RORY: Someone could've walked in that door."
"JESS: And Santa Claus could come down the chimney, whatever."
"RORY: You did not think that it was going to happen like this, did you?"
"JESS: I don't know what I think anymore."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: Rory, stop, just stop! I did not invite you up here, you came up here on your own!"
"RORY: [starts to cry] I don't know what I did. [leaves room]"
"JESS: You didn't do anything. Rory. . ."
"[Rory walks down the staircase crying and Dean stops her]"
"DEAN: Rory. Are you okay?"
"RORY: Yes. No. I don't know."
"DEAN: Whoa, what happened?"
"[Jess walks down the steps]"
"JESS: Figures."
"[He walks away and Dean follows him]"
"RORY: Dean, no."
"[Dean punches Jess and they start fighting throughout the house]"
"RORY: Stop it, guys! Stop it!"
"[Dave walks up to Young Chui]"
"DAVE: Young Chui, we gotta talk."
"YOUNG CHUI: Don't touch me, Dave."
"DAVE: I'm not gonna touch you. I just think it's time you and I had a real talk about the Lane situation."
"YOUNG CHUI: Just a talk?"
"DAVE: We'll keep it friendly, honest."
"[Dean and Jess burst through a door and knock Dave into Young Chui]"
"YOUNG CHUI: Ah, get off me!"
"DAVE: I'm trying."
"[Dean and Jess knock into the band equipment]"
"ZACH: Bogus."
"[Some kids push Dean and Jess out onto the front lawn. Two boys pull them apart]"
"RORY: Guys, just stop it!"
"JESS: Let go of me!"
"RICK: Cops."
"MARSHALL: Oh, no, man. Is that. . ."
"KYLE: Boy with Toothache."
"MARSHALL: Oh, you're dead."
"[a police car pulls up to the house]"
"OFFICER: Okay, dump your cups and go home. Now."
"RORY: Jess. . ."
"[Jess leaves. Rory sees Lane throwing up in the bushes and walks over to her]"
"RORY: Lane. . ."

"OPEN AT KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[Kyle and Marshall are cleaning up litter in the front yard.]"
"KYLE: Get the wrapper."
"MARSHALL: What wrapper?"
"KYLE: The Tootsie Roll wrapper."
"MARSHALL: What Tootsie Roll wrapper?"
"KYLE: The one at your feet."
"MARSHALL: I don't see it."
"KYLE: It's right there."
"MARSHALL: Where?"
"KYLE: Marshall, stop arguing with me, my parents are watching."
"[Lorelai is waiting on the sidewalk; Rory walks out of the house with a backpack]"
"LORELAI: Have you see these guys? They're hilarious."
"RORY: I got it, we can go."
"LORELAI: Why are you holding it like that?"
"RORY: Because when Lane left it here last night, it was a very different color."
"LORELAI: Are you sure she's gonna want that back? It's been left alone all night at a keg party. There's no getting it over that. That backpack is permanently scarred. That backpack is Zelda Fitzgerald."
"RORY: Well, Zelda's going home."
"LORELAI: Okay. Your first cop-raided party. I am just so proud."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I just wish I could've been there."
"RORY: It was no big deal."
"LORELAI: Did they bring the paddywagon?"
"RORY: Yeah, but then we snuck out the backdoor of the speak-easy and headed straight for the Algonquin."
"LORELAI: How was Benchley?"
"RORY: Drunk again."
"LORELAI: So tell me more about this party last night. I mean, I know the end, but what happened in the middle?"
"RORY: Lane's band played, they were great, and then people just hung out and talked, and then, uh, there was some sort of fight, I guess. The cops came, that's it."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[Luke walks up to the house]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: I'm in bed. I have ten more minutes to sleep. Not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but still, ten minutes is ten minutes. You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: Sure, yeah."
"RORY: Ten minutes is great."
"LUKE: And then the phone rings, and it just rings and rings and rings and rings, so I pick it up."
"LORELAI: And then hopefully got your hearing checked."
"LUKE: Can I finish my story?"
"LORELAI: I'm just saying, that's a lot of rings."
"LUKE: And on the other end of the phone is someone named John who says he's Kyle's father, and Kyle threw a party last night without permission. And two guys got into a fight and tore the place apart, so John wants me to come down and take a look at the damage and discuss some sort of solution to the problem of the damages. Now, I don't know John, and I certainly don't know Kyle, but I do know someone who would get into a fight at a party and leave the place completely trashed. It's a wild guess, but I think his name rhymes with Tess. So here I am, heading in there to talk to John about Kyle and discuss what is to be done about the Hummel."
"LORELAI: The what?"
"LUKE: Exactly."
"[Luke walks toward the front door]"
"LORELAI: Uh, so let's get back to the party recap. Any little details you wanna tell Mommy?"
"RORY: Jess and Dean got into the fight."
"LORELAI: Over you."
"RORY: I was a contributing factor."
"LORELAI: Was anyone hurt?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: And that's why the cops came and broke up the party?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: So not only did you go to a cop-raided party but you started the raid?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: This fence is broken because of you, this crap is on the ground because of you."
"RORY: What's your point?"
"LORELAI: [sings] Did you ever know that you're my hero?"
"RORY: Oh my God!"
"LORELAI: [sings] You're everything I would like to be. And I could fly higher than an eagle, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Guests are gathered in the lobby for breakfast. Two of them walk up to Lorelai.]"
"DENNIS: Oh, these muffins, they're brilliant."
"PEG: Tell us you sell your muffin mix."
"LORELAI: Sookie, these people wanna throw roses at your feet."
"SOOKIE: And I will let them."
"PEG: Listen, Sookie, Dennis and I and a bunch of us others wondered if you offered cooking classes."
"SOOKIE: Cooking classes?"
"DENNIS: Some of the better B&B's have them on the itinerary."
"SOOKIE: Oh, of course they do. So, we do, too."
"PEG: We will be your disciples."
"SOOKIE: Oh my gosh, we're gonna have so much fun. We'll start with some spreads and jams, and if there's time - desserts. I have this chocolate balm. . .oh, but breads. . .and soups!"
"LORELAI: Um, Sookie, hon, we don't have a kitchen."
"SOOKIE: Oh, right."
"PEG: There's no kitchen?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, not a problem. You'll all come to my house."
"PEG: Can't wait."
"DENNIS: Cheers."
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk to the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Uh, make a note - if the guests are gonna wear those robes downstairs, we need to buy ones with thicker material."
"SOOKIE: Really."
"LORELAI: Seeing the sunlight hit Dennis gave me a whole new respect for Peg."
"SOOKIE: Hey, listen, uh, Jackson's up in Rochester today helping his cousin rebuild his Nova. He's not getting home 'til late, so you know what that makes me?"
"LORELAI: Available."
"SOOKIE: Like an intern."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"SOOKIE: What are you and Rory doing tonight?"
"LORELAI: I'm open. Rory's got plans with the grandparents."
"SOOKIE: I didn't know you guys were back in touch."
"LORELAI: I'm not, Rory is."
"SOOKIE: Ah."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm, yeah."
"SOOKIE: Well, at least the family pressure's off you now. That's good, right?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I mean, before this whole Friday night dinner thing, I didn't see them regularly and we didn't talk regularly, so it wasn't weird when I didn't see them or talk to them regularly."
"SOOKIE: You miss them."
"LORELAI: No, I just feel like I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do. I feel guilty."
"SOOKIE: So what are you gonna do about it?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna hope it passes."
"SOOKIE: Sounds healthy."
"CUT TO CHURCH"
"[The priest is leading a service at the front of the room. Rory walks in with Lane's backpack and takes it to Lane, who is sitting at a table at the back of the church]"
"PRIEST: Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they. . ."
"RORY: Hey."
"LANE: Hi."
"RORY: So, how are you? How were things last night?"
"LANE: You mean, after my drunken call to my mother?"
"RORY: Yeah. What happened when you got home?"
"LANE: I'm not sure."
"RORY: What do you mean you're not sure?"
"LANE: Well, after I finished with my Farelly brothers' audition in the bushes - thank you for the hair-holding, by the way."
"RORY: Anytime."
"LANE: Dave dropped me off at home. He wanted to come in, but he's an only child and I saw no reason for his family line to end with him, so I went in and he left."
"RORY: And?"
"LANE: The place was dark."
"RORY: No Mrs. Kim?"
"LANE: No Mrs. Kim."
"RORY: No Mrs. Kim."
"LANE: So, of course, I panicked. What does this mean? I mean, when I come home ten minutes late from bible study, she has a cow. But I call her drunk, tell her I'm at a party, I'm a drummer in a band, and I'm in love with a non-Korean. . .I expected there to be backup - aunts, uncles, cousins pulled out from villages I've never heard of, but nothing."
"RORY: I don't understand."
"LANE: So I go upstairs to make sure everything's okay. I look in her room and she's in bed asleep."
"RORY: No."
"LANE: Then this morning, I get up, I go in the kitchen where she's making breakfast and I say, ""Good morning, Mama."""
"RORY: And?"
"LANE: She turns around, looks right at me and says, ""Good morning, Lane."""
"RORY: Really?"
"LANE: And those were the last words she's said to me all day."
"RORY: So she's freezing you out?"
"LANE: No, it was more Stepford than cold. You know, very calm, very serene."
"RORY: Okay, well, let's think. Maybe she didn't hear you."
"LANE: I was drunk, I could've slurred."
"RORY: Exactly. Maybe she thought you said you were at a smarty, playing clock music, drinking fear, and in love with Rave Smitchalsky."
"LANE: And how would that be better?"
"RORY: It's much less clear."
"LANE: What is that smell?"
"RORY: Your backpack."
"PRIEST: Blessed are they which are pers -"
"[The priest sees the rabbi at the back of the church gesturing for him to speed things up.]"
"PRIEST: [speaks quickly] Uh, blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs are the Kingdom of Heaven."
"RORY: You have to talk to her, Lane."
"LANE: I can't talk to her."
"RORY: Well, what are you going to do?"
"LANE: Well, first off, I volunteered to work this table for the next two months. Plus, I told her I'd go to that Seventh Day Adventist college in Hartford and live at home."
"RORY: Lane, no."
"LANE: And I told Dave to forget about the prom. There's no way that's gonna happen."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LANE: Don't be, it's my fault."
"[The rabbi enters with a group of people]"
"PRIEST: And utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me, Amen. Okay, let's go. Sorry, David."
"RABBI: No problem, Archie."
"[The priest leaves, the rabbi starts his service.]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Jess rushes around the crowded diner serving people]"
"WOMAN: Excuse me, I'd like some ham."
"JESS: Be right back."
"WOMAN: But I'd like some ham!"
"[Jess delivers a plate to a table]"
"MAN 1: Is this what I ordered?"
"JESS: Yes. [walks to the table by the door] Know what you want yet?"
"MAN 2: Oh, uh, no, not yet."
"JESS: You know what might help?"
"MAN 2: What?"
"JESS: Opening the menu."
"MAN 2: Yes, thank you for the tip."
"[Jess walks to the counter]"
"JESS: I need ham."
"CAESAR: No ham."
"JESS: We got a shipment of ham yesterday."
"CAESAR: No ham."
"JESS: Caesar, there's a lady over there that has been saying she wants ham for the last twenty minutes and if I go back there empty handed, there's a fifty-fifty chance that she will eat me."
"CAESAR: No ham."
"JESS: Then sew some bacon together 'cause that woman is getting ham."
"[Jess picks up a plate and walks toward the tables]"
"MAN 1: Excuse me, I don't think this is what I. . .[Jess exchanges his plate with the one he's carrying] Thank you."
"JESS: [holds up the plate] Who ordered this? Look in front of you. If there is nothing there and there should be, then this is yours."
"KIRK: Oh, here."
"[Jess gives Kirk the plate, then walks back over to the man at the table by the door]"
"JESS: Well?"
"MAN 2: What?"
"JESS: You know what you want yet?"
"MAN 2: I'll just have more coffee."
"JESS: More coffee coming up. Glad to make your dining dreams come true."
"[Taylor walks in]"
"TAYLOR: [sings] ""Oh, who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew. Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two, the candy man. Oh, the candy man can!"" Yes, that's right, the candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good, and I, ladies and gentlemen, am the candy man. Your candy man. I'm mixing it with love and making Stars Hollow taste good."
"JESS: Move."
"TAYLOR: Uh, in a second Jess. Give him a taffy. I come to announce to one and all that the day we all thought would never get here has arrived."
"KIRK: Arbor Day?"
"TAYLOR: No."
"KIRK: The Day of Reckoning?"
"TAYLOR: No"
"KIRK: The day the music died?"
"TAYLOR: Kirk."
"KIRK: Give me a taffy."
"TAYLOR: What?"
"KIRK: I've got a million of 'em. Give me a taffy!"
"TAYLOR: As I was saying, the big day has arrived. The opening of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store! Tomorrow from noon to six, there will be fun, balloons, ice cream, and old fashioned penny candy for just one dollar a piece. Come at noon, stay all day. . ."
"[Luke walks in]"
"JESS: Where the hell have you been? The place is a freaking zoo. Every table's full and I've got Sammy Davis Jr. here thinking it's the Desert Inn."
"LUKE: I had to run an errand."
"JESS: Everybody's complaining, we're out of ham, Caesar's suddenly decided to join the Slow Food Movement, and I've got a guy who's moved in at a table for four. He just sits, making it impossible for me to turn over that table, and if I can't turn over that table, then that cuts way back on my tips."
"LUKE: I'm sorry, don't you mean my tips?"
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: You know where I was this morning?"
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: I was at Kyle's. His parents called me this morning."
"JESS: Oh, yeah?"
"LUKE: Seems a little party you went to last night got a little Animal House, huh?"
"JESS: Dean started it."
"LUKE: Oh, you're not really gonna use that one, are you?"
"JESS: Well, he did. He sucker punched me and I was just defending myself."
"LUKE: Oh, apparently you defended yourself all the way through the house and out into the front yard. You defended yourself with a chair that is now broken. You defended yourself with a coffee table. You defended yourself with an ottoman."
"JESS: I don't need a recap."
"LUKE: Do you have any idea how much damage you caused?"
"JESS: Dean caused it, too."
"LUKE: The place was trashed."
"JESS: Dean trashed it, too."
"LUKE: Are you trying to k*ll me?"
"JESS: Nope, it'll just be a perk."
"LUKE: Okay, well, here's the deal. From now on, every cent that you make here goes toward paying them back."
"JESS: Hey, what about -"
"LUKE: Dean's paying them back also."
"JESS: How do you know?"
"LUKE: Because he was at Kyle's house when I got there."
"JESS: You're kidding me."
"LUKE: He had already worked out a financial agreement with the parents and was helping them put a fence back up."
"JESS: Man, he's gonna make some woman a fine doormat someday."
"LUKE: You are making good on this, Jess."
"JESS: I have to get more coffee out of the store room."
"LUKE: Every cent is getting paid back. I never want those people calling me again."
"[The man at the table by the door gets up and leaves. Luke notices that the man left his wallet on the table. Luke picks it up, then walks out the door to catch him]"
"LUKE: Hey, you left your wallet! Hey!"
"[Luke opens the wallet and checks the ID]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks down the steps carrying some skirts. Rory is in the living room getting ready to leave]"
"LORELAI: Okay, here's the problem. Every single one of my skirts is either too long or too short for this season's acceptable lengths. Which means I either have to alter or shop."
"RORY: To be or not to be."
"LORELAI: Just wait 'til you hear what InStyle thinks of you, young lady. What time are you getting home tonight?"
"RORY: We have to go over the special graduation edition of the Franklin, and of course we're completely behind, partly because Paris can't let anything go to print unless she's proofed it a million times. Can you say crazy a**l micromanager?"
"LORELAI: Not five times fast."
"RORY: I'll be home by ten."
"LORELAI: That's all I needed to know."
"RORY: I forgot my notes."
"LORELAI: I put them in your bedroom."
"[Rory walks to her bedroom. Lorelai picks up the phone and dials a number]"
"EMILY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yup, it's me. So, how are you?"
"EMILY: I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Good. How's Dad?"
"EMILY: He's fine."
"LORELAI: Also good."
"EMILY: May I speak with Rory please?"
"LORELAI: No, you can't speak with Rory."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because I called you."
"EMILY: So what?"
"LORELAI: You don't get to request a switch when a person calls you."
"EMILY: I'm sure she's standing right there."
"LORELAI: Not the point. If you wanna talk to Rory, you have to call. Then when I answer the phone, you can ask for Rory. But you didn't call, I called, so you cannot ask for Rory."
"EMILY: What do you want, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to see how you were. I haven't seen you for awhile."
"EMILY: Your choice."
"LORELAI: No, your choice, Mom."
"EMILY: You're the one who called off Friday night dinners."
"LORELAI: No, I'm the one who called off the obligation for Friday night dinners. You're the one who called off. . .ugh, you know what, I didn't call to argue."
"EMILY: Fine, let's not argue."
"LORELAI: Come on, Mom, this is silly. I mean, think back to before the whole Friday night dinner thing. We still had a relationship."
"EMILY: You mean the one where I would trick you into calling me by leaving a message on your answering machine saying I had something important to tell you, but I wouldn't include the details so you had no choice but to call me."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: And then when you did call, we'd talk about the weather, you'd ask about the DAR, and then you'd put Rory on the phone, even when she was too young to talk."
"LORELAI: It was not always like that."
"EMILY: It was always like that. Very well. The weather's fine, the DAR is staging a luncheon at the library next week. You already said I couldn't talk to Rory, so there, I think you've fulfilled your obligation."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom, fine. Have a nice day."
"EMILY: Same to you."
"[They hang up. Lorelai's phone rings]"
"LORELAI: It's for you!"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory rushes into the Franklin meeting]"
"RORY: Sorry, sorry, sorry."
"PARIS: The issue is a disaster. It's our last issue of the Franklin and it's a complete disaster."
"RORY: I'm sure it's not that bad."
"PARIS: And that's why you won't need to Botox your frown lines on your nineteenth birthday. [to another student] Not that picture, no, put it down. Put it down now! [walks away]"
"[Rory walks over to Madeline and Louise]"
"RORY: How's it coming?"
"LOUISE: Very frustrating."
"MADELINE: We just can't seem to get exactly the right combination."
"LOUISE: All right. How about blue dress, blonde guy, black limo? Works best for me."
"MADELINE: Yes, however, green dress, red-haired guy, white limo works best for me."
"LOUISE: White limo with blonde guy totally doesn't work. It's too washed up."
"RORY: I'm assuming this conversation veered off of the cover page placement?"
"MADELINE: How about black-haired guy, green dress and tan limo?"
"LOUISE: Tan limo?"
"MADELINE: Good neutral backdrop."
"LOUISE: Well, this opens up a whole new set of options. Bring the golf team back in."
"RORY: Okay, why don't I just get these pesky Franklin articles out of your way. There we go."
"PARIS: What are you doing?"
"RORY: I am working on the front page placement."
"PARIS: What are they doing?"
"RORY: Staying true to who they are."
"LOUISE: Look, prom is once. It happens, it's photographed, and then it's there forever."
"MADELINE: Planning is essential."
"LOUISE: By the way, Paris, we left a space for you in the limo. However, we're gonna need the color of your dress."
"MADELINE: And a picture of Jamie."
"LOUISE: And the amount of flexibility that you have with the color of your dress."
"MADELINE: And with Jamie."
"PARIS: Thank you, but we've already made our plans for prom night. Jamie hired a private car to drive us to the prom. We'll go in, take the picture, depending on the level of lameness, dance. Then he's taking me to dinner at Antoine's, followed by a helicopter ride to join his parents out in Martha's Vineyard for the weekend."
"MADELINE: What color's the helicopter?"
"PARIS: As you were. [to Rory] So, have you figured out your plans for prom night yet?"
"RORY: Oh, no, but Stars Hollow is a much more casual kind of a prom. Less Cinderella, more Footloose."
"PARIS: Still a prom."
"RORY: It is still a prom."
"PARIS: I can't wait."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk down the street]"
"LORELAI: It's my own fault. I poked a slumbering bear with a stick. I reached out and initiated contact with Emily Gilmore. I get what I deserve."
"SOOKIE: You're a bad girl."
"LORELAI: You know what really stinks? They're having Rory over tonight for a movie night."
"SOOKIE: Movie night? That's your thing with her."
"LORELAI: Exactly. What's next? ""Stay home and dance around in your underwear to the Monkees' greatest hits"" night?"
"SOOKIE: I wouldn't put it past them to steal that, too."
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"[They read a sign on the bakery door that says Fran has passed away]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: Fran."
"LORELAI: Poor thing."
"SOOKIE: I don't believe it."
"LORELAI: Such a great lady."
"SOOKIE: Great lady."
"LORELAI: Eighty-three on her last birthday. A good long life."
"SOOKIE: We should all be so lucky."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna miss her."
"SOOKIE: Me, too. So. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"SOOKIE: I guess this'll put that old inn of hers on the market."
"LORELAI: Right, right. I mean, she wanted to keep it as long as she was alive, and now. . ."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: You don't think that because we wanted the property so much, we k*ll Fran."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Through the power of our minds."
"LORELAI: No, no, we wished for the property, not this!"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, but you never know with karma."
"LORELAI: Look, we loved Fran, right?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, we did."
"LORELAI: And whether or not we get the Dragonfly Inn has nothing to do with her dying right now."
"SOOKIE: Right. . .sort of."
"LORELAI: Besides, we don't know what's happening with the inn."
"SOOKIE: Fran has no heirs."
"LORELAI: You never know. Some long lost gold-toothed cousin could come out of the woodwork, inherit it and turn it into a beauty salon or law offices."
"SOOKIE: Not our Dragonfly!"
"LORELAI: The point is, if we are meant to have the Dragonfly Inn, then we are meant to have it."
"SOOKIE: Right. Like Doris Day."
"LORELAI: Que sera."
"SOOKIE: Sera."
"LORELAI: Let's focus on Fran and how much we loved her. Not think about the inn at all."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: You're thinking about it."
"SOOKIE: Just about where to put the woodburning oven."
"LORELAI: We'll put it in the apartment that we're sharing in hell."
"SOOKIE: Let's buy flowers."
"LORELAI: Yeah, lots and lots of flowers."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lane and Mrs. Kim are polishing a set of chairs]"
"LANE: This is a really nice chair. Is it old?"
"MRS. KIM: Old enough."
"LANE: Well, it's really nice. I mean, the back is very sturdy and the legs are all the same length and the wood looks like it was a tree at some point, which is good for wood, 'cause it was."
"[There's a knock at the front door]"
"MRS. KIM: Could you get that please?"
"LANE: Yes, Mama."
"[Lane walks to the door and answers it. Dave is standing on the porch]"
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"DAVE: I'm here to see your mother."
"LANE: What?"
"DAVE: Excuse me."
"LANE: Dave, Dave, wait!"
"[Dave walks into the house and over to Mrs. Kim]"
"DAVE: Excuse me, Mrs. Kim, I need to speak with you."
"MRS. KIM: I'm busy, David."
"DAVE: A few weeks ago you told me that Lane had a crush on me. Well, I have a crush on her, too. Now, I know you have very strict rules about dating and boys, but I just want you to know that I'm a good person. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I've never gotten a ticket, I'm healthy, I take care of myself, I floss. I never watch more than 30 minutes of television a night partly because I think it's a waste of time and partly because there's nothing on. I respect my parents, I do well in school, I never play video games in case they do someday prove that playing them can turn you into a serial k*ll. I don't drink coffee. I hate soda because the carbonation freaks me out. I'm happy to give up meat if you feel strongly about it. I don't mind wearing a tie. I enjoy playing those hymns on my guitar, and I really, really want to take your daughter to the prom."
"[Mrs. Kim doesn't say anything]"
"DAVE: Mrs. Kim? Please don't make me repeat that list again."
"MRS. KIM: Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass, but still remember what the Lord hath done."
"DAVE: Okay, thank you."
"[Dave and Lane walk outside.]"
"DAVE: Did you hear what she said?"
"LANE: Yes, I did."
"DAVE: What did it mean?"
"LANE: I don't know."
"DAVE: Was it a yes, was it a no?"
"LANE: I'm not sure."
"DAVE: Well, it's gotta be from the bible, right? So I'll just go home, do some research, look on the Internet, see what I can find. I'll call you when I know something."
"LANE: Okay."
"[He kisses her, then leaves]"
"LANE: I'm so writing him a song tonight."
"CUT TO MOTEL"
"[The man who left his wallet in the diner is in his motel room. There's a knock at the door, he answers it, Luke is there.]"
"LUKE: Left your wallet in the diner. [tosses it to him]"
"JIMMY: Oh, wow, did I? Look at that. I guess I did. Thanks for bringing it back."
"LUKE: No problem."
"JIMMY: You know, I really like this driver's license picture, too, so you could imagine what a drag it would be to have to replace it."
"LUKE: So what are you doing here, Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: Just passing through."
"LUKE: Passing through from where?"
"JIMMY: California."
"LUKE: California?"
"JIMMY: Yeah, I've been there for a few years now, seems to be working out."
"LUKE: Well, glad to hear it."
"JIMMY: Yeah."
"LUKE: So what are you doing here, Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: Nothing, really, just. . ."
"LUKE: He hasn't missed you."
"JIMMY: I'm sure that he hasn't."
"LUKE: Never says a word about you."
"JIMMY: I wouldn't expect he would."
"LUKE: Do you know why he doesn't miss you, Jimmy? Because you're a loser and nobody missed a loser."
"JIMMY: It's been seventeen years, Luke."
"LUKE: Oh, you remember how long it's been. I am impressed."
"JIMMY: Yeah, well, I always could count."
"LUKE: And your list of attributes ends there."
"JIMMY: Okay, so I guess we're not playing nice anymore."
"LUKE: You know, the last time I saw you is right after Liz gave birth. You were gonna go out and buy some diapers and meet us back at the apartment. Remember that?"
"JIMMY: Yes."
"LUKE: You went out, but you never came back."
"JIMMY: A lot of time has passed and a lot of things have changed."
"LUKE: Really, like what things? You?"
"JIMMY: Yes, me. Maybe. Why not?"
"LUKE: Oh, come on, you never called before. Why now? What do you want, you need money?"
"JIMMY: What?"
"LUKE: 'Cause he doesn't have any."
"JIMMY: I don't need money."
"LUKE: I don't have any either."
"JIMMY: I don't need money."
"LUKE: So the look is a choice?"
"JIMMY: No, I just wanted to. . .I don't know, see him."
"LUKE: Why now?"
"JIMMY: I don't know, I just thought it was time. You don't think it was time?"
"LUKE: You really want my opinion on this subject?"
"JIMMY: Luke, give me a break."
"LUKE: Give you a break? I am trying to keep this kid from falling off the face of the Earth. I'm trying to get him through school. I'm trying to give him a future. And I gotta be totally honest with you, Jimmy - I am not doing too well."
"JIMMY: No?"
"LUKE: No, and the last thing he needs is a special appearance by his father who can't be here for any good reason."
"JIMMY: There's no evil plan here. I have a job, a life. I just thought I'd come and..."
"LUKE: What? Say hello, see if he looks like you? Then what?"
"JIMMY: Well. . ."
"LUKE: What?"
"JIMMY: I don't know!"
"LUKE: Okay, well, while you're figuring it out, let me plant this little thought in your head - you do or say anything to upset Jess and make it harder for me to keep him on the right path, I'm gonna put your head through a wall. Any wall, you can pick the wall, but it's gonna be a wall, okay?"
"JIMMY: I just wanted to see him."
"LUKE: Well, you saw him. Now get outta here."

"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking toward the church for the funeral]"
"LORELAI: You know, Fran was one of the first people I met when we moved here."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: The first day here, I stopped in. . ."
"RORY: And asked her for directions to the inn."
"LORELAI: Yeah. She was so sweet. And oh my God, she loved you. I didn't think she was gonna let me leave the bakery with you. She just kept giving you cookies in a shameless attempt to buy your affections away from me. And let me tell you, for a couple weeks, it worked. For two weeks, you just kept staring at me like, ""You're the lady who took me away from the cookies. I'm gonna k*ll you."""
"RORY: Mom, can I just meet you at the church?"
"LORELAI: Why, what are you planning? Is it finally payback time?"
"RORY: I just need to stop in at Doose's and get something. Kleenex, we'll need Kleenex."
"LORELAI: Aw, I'll come with you."
"RORY: Um, well. . ."
"[They approach a bench where Miss Patty is sitting, crying]"
"LORELAI: Aw, Patty. . ."
"MISS PATTY: Now it all starts."
"LORELAI: What all starts, honey?"
"MISS PATTY: First Fran, then the rest of us."
"LORELAI: Aw, Patty, it's not the plague. It was just her time."
"MISS PATTY: I can't go."
"LORELAI: Yes, you can. Come on."
"MISS PATTY: No, just leave me."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna get her to the church."
"RORY: I'll meet you there. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Come on, let's go."
"MISS PATTY: You know, it's times like these that you realize what is truly important in your life. I'm so glad I had all that sex."
"LORELAI: Hurry, honey."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[The diner is empty except for Jess at the counter. Rory starts to enter the diner, then stops herself. She walks away, then walks back to the door and stops herself again. Luke walks down into the diner and watches. Rory walks away. Jess sees her and starts to follow after her. He stops himself and walks back to the counter. He starts to go after her again, then walks back in and sees Luke watching him]"
"JESS: What are you looking at? [goes upstairs]"
"CUT TO CHURCH"
"[People are entering the church for the funeral. Taylor is greeting people at the door]"
"TAYLOR: Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed."
"[Everyone takes their seats, and the priest starts the service]"
"PRIEST: Welcome all. The large number of people here today is a testament to how much Fran Weston has touched each and every one of us. We'd like to start by inviting Marjorie Rogers, Fran's close friend, to share a few words with us."
"[Marjorie walks to the podium]"
"MARJORIE: In 1955, Fran opened Weston's Bakery. Back then, she was the new kid on the block, and soon thereafter, she hired me, a mother of three rugrats and a husband overseas, and we became best friends. Still are."
"LORELAI: That's so sweet."
"SOOKIE: You think we'll still be friends when we're dead?"
"LORELAI: I will if you will."
"MARJORIE: Fran was and is Stars Hollow. And to ensure that her love and spirit continue, Weston's Bakery will remain open and run by those who have Fran's heart in their hearts."
"[applause]"
"MARJORIE: Of course, Fran's family has been here long before even Fran. They opened the Dragonfly Inn back in 1893. The Dragonfly Inn was once regarded as the Violet Lady, the premiere inn in all of . . .[the microphone goes out]."
"LORELAI: What'd she say?"
"SOOKIE: I heard ""premiere inn"" then squat."
"LORELAI: Is she still talking about the inn?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"KIRK: Shh!"
"[the microphone fades in and out as Marjorie continues speaking]"
"MARJORIE: Inn . . .ortant role. . .ing. . .it's special. . .all who. . ."
"LORELAI: She said ""inn."""
"SOOKIE: And ""ortant"" and ""ing."""
"MARJORIE: . . .set. . .World w*r. . ."
"SOOKIE: She said World w*r."
"LORELAI: One or two? Where are we, where are we?"
"MARJORIE: . . .Fran. . ."
"SOOKIE: She's pointing to somebody."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's a man in a suit."
"SOOKIE: Does he have a gold tooth?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: You guys, people are turning."
"MARJORIE: . . .to you all. [leaves the podium]"
"SOOKIE: Did she say who gets the inn?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"[The priest returns to the podium and fixes the microphone]"
"PRIEST: Uh, thank you, Marjorie. And now, I'd like to point out that the time is twelve p.m., the time Fran would normally be opening her doors on Sunday after church, welcoming us to join her in friendship at Weston's Bakery. So, if we may at this time all bow our heads for a minute of silence to mark the passing of the soul and our dear departed friend."
"[a marching band starts playing outside]"
"TAYLOR: No, no, the grand opening is canceled! Sorry, folks. [runs outside to stop the band] Stop, it is canceled. . .canceled!"
"CUT TO LATER AT THE FUNERAL"
"PRIEST: As we close, I'd like to honor a special request Fran had, and that is to take one final stroll around the Town Square before going to her final resting place. All those who would like to participate, please assemble outside."
"MRS. KIM: [to Lane] Walking with dead people not my thing. Let's go."
"RORY: Where's Sookie?"
"LORELAI: Just giving our condolences."
"RORY: And asking what you missed when the mike cut out?"
"LORELAI: And giving our condolences."
"[Sookie walks over to them]"
"SOOKIE: The man in the suit's name is Brink. He's a lawyer and he's here to get Fran's affairs in order."
"LORELAI: Do you think we can talk to him?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, but Lorelai, you have to get back to the inn and I've got those B&Bers waiting at my home to learn how to make jam."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, let's get him now."
"SOOKIE: I think our window of opportunity just slammed shut."
"[They see the lawyer helping carry the casket out of the church]"
"LORELAI: Great."
"SOOKIE: Now what?"
"LORELAI: We very respectfully hover in his vicinity until the walk is over. . ."
"SOOKIE: Then we will politely ask him to get in touch with us."
"LORELAI: Yes. Coming?"
"RORY: No, you guys go ahead. I'll be in the back of the line so that when the earth opens up and swallows you whole, I'll be here to tell a story."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory walks out of the church and Dean walks up to her.]"
"DEAN: Hey, Rory."
"RORY: Oh, hey. You were in there?"
"DEAN: Yeah. I got here late so I kind of just hung in the back."
"RORY: It was nice of you to come."
"DEAN: Well, she was a nice lady."
"RORY: Yeah, she was."
"DEAN: Listen, uh, can I talk to you for a sec? We'll catch up, I promise."
"RORY: Sure."
"DEAN: Good. Okay, um. . ."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: Come on."
"RORY: Dean, what are you doing?"
"DEAN: Okay. Uh, are you ready?"
"RORY: Yes, I'm ready."
"DEAN: I asked Lindsay to marry me."
"RORY: You. . .you. . ."
"DEAN: And she said yes."
"RORY: She. . .she.. ."
"DEAN: So what do you think?"
"RORY: I. . . I. . ."
"DEAN: I know, who woulda thought? I mean, it's weird, but Lindsay's amazing and I asked and she said yes, so. . .I'm getting married. Say something."
"RORY: Why?"
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: No, I don't mean why, I mean, why now?"
"DEAN: Why not now?"
"RORY: Well, you're eighteen, first of all."
"DEAN: So?"
"RORY: So, you're young. I mean, you haven't even gone to college yet. Oh my God, you are still going to college, aren't you?"
"DEAN: Yes, Rory, I'm still going to college."
"RORY: Well, how. . ."
"DEAN: Lindsay's gonna go with me."
"RORY: But Dean, you're going to be studying and taking classes, you need to focus on that. I mean, you don't even know what you wanna do yet. And you guys haven't even been going out for that long. I mean, why don't you just date for awhile? Dating's fun."
"DEAN: Thank you."
"RORY: For what?"
"DEAN: For your deep heartfelt congratulations."
"RORY: You just. . .you took me by surprise."
"DEAN: So what? It's good news, you can't just be happy for me?"
"RORY: I can. I am. I just. . ."
"DEAN: You know what, I'm sorry if you have a crappy relationship with Jess."
"RORY: Hey, that has -"
"DEAN: And I'm sorry if he treats you like dirt and everyone hates him, but that was your choice. I have a great girlfriend and I am really happy, and when you dumped me for that jackass, I thought I'd never be happy again."
"RORY: Jess does not treat me like dirt."
"DEAN: Whatever. I just wanted you to hear it from me before it got out. Now you know, so, um, have a nice life. [walks away]"
"RORY: Jess does not treat me like dirt!"
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs. Kim is making tea in the kitchen. Lane walks in]"
"LANE: Mama, do you need any help?"
"MRS. KIM: No, thank you."
"LANE: I could get out the soy scones."
"MRS. KIM: If you like."
"LANE: Tofutter?"
"MRS. KIM: Fine."
"LANE: Mama, I'm really sorry about the other night. I did everything wrong, everything you taught me not to do. I lied to you, I let you down. I never intended to do that and I don't know how to fix it, but I'm going to try my hardest because I am so, so sorry. I'll be upstairs if you need me. I'm gonna go in my room, gonna iron my dress for church and I'm gonna think about what I've done."
"[Lane starts to go up to her room. The doorbell rings and Mrs. Kim answers the door. Dave is on the porch]"
"DAVE: I stayed up all night. I read the entire bible cover to cover. I don't know what it means."
"MRS. KIM: David."
"DAVE: You have to tell me what it means. Is it yes, is it no? I can't feel my right elbow anymore. I don't even know why, but I can't."
"MRS. KIM: David."
"DAVE: Please, just tell me. I'm so tired."
"MRS. KIM: It's not from the bible."
"DAVE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: It's Shakespeare, Henry VI. I like to goof off now and then, too, you know."
"DAVE: Shakespeare."
"MRS. KIM: That is a very difficult this to do, reading the bible in one night. I myself have only done it three times. You need great determination and excellent light. I'm very impressed. All right."
"DAVE: All right what?"
"MRS. KIM: You can go to the prom, but you cannot get married."
"DAVE: That seems fair to me."
"LANE: And me! The person who is going upstairs to think about what she's done."
"MRS. KIM: Lane is grounded until the prom and for two months after. You may call her on the phone every other day for ten minutes and that is all. Understand?"
"DAVE: Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mrs. Kim."
"[Mrs. Kim walks away. Lane and Dave smile at each other]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: Thinking about what I've done!"
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[A line of mourners are slowly following behind the pall bearers carrying Fran's casket]"
"LORELAI: So apparently we're all supposed to walk like Fran."
"SOOKIE: It's almost four."
"LORELAI: Okay, I've gotta take some initiative here."
"SOOKIE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Just focus on the ground and look lost in grief."
"[they move up so they are standing alongside Fran's lawyer]"
"LORELAI: It was a nice service."
"LAWYER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: And this is a really nice idea, the walk around the square."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, a great idea. I may steal it when I die. You know, ask them to walk me around a benefit counter. Might freak out the makeover girls, but it's -"
"SOOKIE: It's nice."
"LORELAI: Really nice. So listen, my name is Lorelai Gilmore and this is Sookie St. James."
"SOOKIE: Hi."
"LORELAI: I know this isn't exactly the best time for this, but we were wondering if you had any idea what's going to happen with the Dragonfly."
"SOOKIE: Because we want it!"
"LORELAI: Sookie and I actually talked to Fran about buying it once."
"SOOKIE: We work in the Independence Inn now."
"LAWYER: The one that b*rned down?"
"LORELAI: Yes, but that was just an accident. It was a bad wire."
"SOOKIE: A bad, bad wire."
"LORELAI: It could've happened to anyone and should in no way reflect our inn-running abilities."
"LAWYER: Yes, well, do you think we could discuss this a little later? This is a little heavy and I sort of need to focus."
"LORELAI: Oh, let me help you here. [grabs onto the casket] Ooh, wow, for a little woman. . .Sookie, will you just. . ."
"SOOKIE: Oh, right. [helps carry the casket]"
"LORELAI: Anyway, we were just wondering, did she leave the Dragonfly to anyone?"
"LAWYER: No, she didn't."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay. And do you know what the family wants to do with it?"
"LAWYER: We haven't talked in depth about it, but I'm pretty sure they're gonna sell it."
"LORELAI: Well, we would really like to buy it."
"SOOKIE: And keep it as an inn."
"LORELAI: Yes, a wonderful inn."
"SOOKIE: Dedicated to Fran."
"LORELAI: Yes, but keep it the Dragonfly."
"SOOKIE: And we promise not to burn it down."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, that's right. Hey, we could put that in the agreement. Ow. . ."
"LAWYER: Uh, here, why don't you. . ."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Anyway, what do you say?"
"LAWYER: Well. . ."
"KIRK: Excuse me, but you're blocking her view."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry Kirk, sorry. So you were saying?"
"LAWYER: I'll tell you what, you contact me on Monday and we can discuss this. As far as I'm concerned, if the check clears, it's all yours."
"LORELAI: It's all ours."
"SOOKIE: It's all ours."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Jess is cleaning up when Jimmy walks in]"
"JESS: We're closed. Learn to read. You're the loser coffee guy."
"JIMMY: Well, not as cool as Bono, but I'll take it."
"JESS: We're -"
"JIMMY: Closed. Yeah, I heard."
"JESS: Okay, so we're still -"
"JIMMY: I'm your father."
"JESS: - closed. What?"
"JIMMY: I'm your. . ."
"JESS: Are you sure?"
"JIMMY: Am I. . .yes, I'm sure. I didn't mean to spring this on you. I thought Luke would've told you that I -"
"JESS: Luke would've told me?"
"JIMMY: Well, yeah, he came to see me last night. He didn't tell you. That's obvious because you're still doing the staring with the frown and. . .you look different."
"JESS: You want some coffee?"
"JIMMY: Sure. Thanks."
"JESS: It's old."
"JIMMY: Okay."
"[They sit down at a table and both silently listen to a song on the radio for a minute]"
"JIMMY: I gotta go."
"[Jimmy quickly gets up and leaves]"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street]"
"LORELAI: I was negotiating at a funeral."
"RORY: I saw."
"LORELAI: Which might've been the most inappropriate thing to happen today until that gnat flew into Kirk's mouth and he freaked and dropped the casket."
"RORY: It was a nice save."
"LORELAI: I'm feeling so weird. I'm completely sad about Fran, but the inn. . .it's really gonna happen."
"RORY: Yeah, seems like it."
"LORELAI: Hey, come here."
"[they stop in front of a store with a prom dress in the window]"
"LORELAI: That one would look great on you."
"RORY: Oh, I don't know."
"LORELAI: We should come back tomorrow and try it on."
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Hey, prom's coming up, kid. We need to get you a dress. Unless you want me to make you one."
"RORY: No, that's okay."
"LORELAI: Maybe we could hit the mall tomorrow after school. I could meet you in Hartford and we could go to a fancy store where they'll follow us around like we're thieves."
"RORY: I don't wanna talk about dresses anymore."
"LORELAI: We've only been talking about dresses for two minutes."
"RORY: Well, it feels like longer."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: And I don't know if I even need a dress, okay, 'cause I don't even know if I'm going to the prom."
"LORELAI: I thought Jess agreed."
"RORY: Well, that was before."
"LORELAI: Before what?"
"RORY: Before the party, before the fight, before the thing in Kyle's bedroom."
"LORELAI: Okay, come with me."
"[they both get into the Jeep]"
"LORELAI: Okay, we left off with the thing in Kyle's bedroom."
"RORY: I don't understand. One minute he's happy, then he's not. And he doesn't tell me anything ever. I mean, you're supposed to tell your girlfriend things. That's the whole point of having a girlfriend, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it is. Now, Kyle's bedroom, what happened there?"
"RORY: And I'm so tired of fighting. Or not even fighting because he won't fight. He just gets mad and disappears and then comes back and I don't like how I feel and I don't like what I do."
"LORELAI: Like what you do where, in Kyle's bedroom?"
"RORY: I don't wanna feel like this, I don't wanna sit around wondering when we're going to talk, if he's mad, why he's mad. I hate this. I really, really -"
"LORELAI: Honey, you gotta tell Mommy what happened in Kyle's bedroom!"
"RORY: Jess was upset and I went to look for him and we were kissing and then it seemed like he wanted to. . ."
"LORELAI: Did you?"
"RORY: No, I didn't. And then he got all weird like he was mad at me."
"LORELAI: Hey, if he was mad at you because you wouldn't have sex with him, then he's a jerk."
"RORY: I know that, but I don't even know if that's why he's mad at me. I don't know if he's mad at me. I don't know anything because he won't talk. He just sulks then disappears, and just when you're through with him, he shows up at hockey games with Distiller tickets."
"LORELAI: Distiller tickets? What Distiller tickets?"
"RORY: Oh, that's right, you don't know about that because I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed because I didn't wanna be that girl and you don't want me to be that girl, but after the hockey game, I was that girl."
"LORELAI: What girl? Help me, drag me along, honey."
"RORY: The girl who lets her boyfriend treat her like dirt and then lies to her mom about it."
"LORELAI: Okay, you need a breath here."
"RORY: Something's going on with him and it's been going on for awhile."
"LORELAI: You can't make him talk, Rory. He has to want to."
"RORY: But why doesn't he want to?"
"LORELAI: Because it's probably hard for him."
"[There is a car waiting to take their parking spot. Lorelai leans out the car window to yell at the driver]"
"LORELAI: Hey, we're not leaving. We're gonna live in this car and we're gonna die in this car, so find another frickin' spot. [to Rory] Honey. . ."
"RORY: I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I'm tired of talking about it. I'm just. . .tired."
"LORELAI: Okay. So. . ."
"RORY: Nothing happened."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Jess is sitting at the table, Luke walks in]"
"LUKE: Hey. You hungry? I can make us some eggs."
"JESS: So I hear you went to see my father last night."
"LUKE: Yeah, I did."
"JESS: Were you gonna tell me?"
"LUKE: He came by?"
"JESS: He came by."
"LUKE: I didn't think he'd have the guts."
"JESS: So what were you thinking?"
"LUKE: Jess, I don't like your father very much."
"JESS: So because you don't like him, that means I can't know he's here?"
"LUKE: You know he's here."
"JESS: No thanks to you."
"LUKE: Shouldn't have come from me in the first place."
"JESS: So what, you don't think you owed it to me to tell me, prepare me?"
"LUKE: No, Jess, I didn't. With everything that's going on here with you, I kinda hoped he'd just walk away, but. . .once again, Jimmy makes the wrong move. What a shock."
"JESS: Oh, who the hell are you to decide what the right move is?"
"LUKE: I'm the one who's saving your ass constantly. I'm the one who just wrote a check to Kyle's father so he wouldn't press charges against you. I'm the one trying to knock some sense into that thick head of yours about the future."
"JESS: Oh, here we go."
"LUKE: You don't take anything seriously. That's why you're doing so crappy in school. You're smart enough, you read more than anyone I've ever seen. There's no reason why you should be barely graduating."
"JESS: I'm not."
"LUKE: You're not what?"
"JESS: I'm not graduating."
"LUKE: Yes, you are."
"JESS: No, I'm not."
"LUKE: Yes, you are."
"JESS: No, I'm not."
"LUKE: Yes, you are, because we had an agreement that if you were gonna live here, you were gonna go to school and you were gonna graduate."
"JESS: Well, I didn't and I'm not."
"LUKE: What is wrong with you? What, did you do this just to spite me?"
"JESS: Look, forget it, it's done."
"LUKE: What's your life now? Wal-Mart full time, that's your great future? Gonna take the plunge and buy yourself a second blue vest?"
"JESS: Maybe, why not? What's wrong with it? I mean, it's no diner."
"LUKE: Hey, I own this business, kid! I built it, this is mine! I'm not at the mercy of some boss waiting and hoping to be chosen employee of the month for a couple extra hundred bucks and a plaque. I'm always employee of the month. I'm employee of the year, of the century, of the universe. You should be so lucky to have a job like mine. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna live here one more year, you're gonna quit you job, you're gonna take twelfth grade over again, and you will graduate."
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: I'm not playing with you here, Jess. You quit your job, you go to school."
"JESS: I am not going back to school!"
"LUKE: So that's it?"
"JESS: Yeah, that's it."
"LUKE: Then you gotta go."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai has set up breakfast on the kitchen table; Rory walks out of her room]"
"RORY: I thought I smelled coffee."
"LORELAI: Good morning your highness. I trust you slept well."
"RORY: And to what do I owe this lovely display of domesticity?"
"LORELAI: Well, being brilliant and all, I figured you would probably still not be in the mood to go to Luke's this morning, so I thought we'd have a nice little breakfast here."
"RORY: Wow, okay. Hey."
"LORELAI: Good?"
"RORY: These are from Luke's."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: You got up this morning, went to Luke's and brought this back."
"LORELAI: Well, I sure as hell am not gonna cook."
"RORY: They're good, thank you."
"LORELAI: Put 'em on a plate just the way you like 'em."
"[Rory looks at the newspaper]"
"RORY: Well, there it is."
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Lister announce the engagement of their daughter Lindsay Ann to Dean Forrester, son of Randy and Barbara Forrester."" My God, they're a good looking couple. If their kids can sing there's no stopping 'em."
"RORY: I still don't understand why they need to get married."
"LORELAI: Maybe they have to get married before he grows so tall she won't be able to talk to him anymore."
"RORY: I really do want him to be happy."
"LORELAI: I know. You're good in that department."
"RORY: Some people get married young and everything turns out fine."
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"RORY: That'd be nice."
"LORELAI: Well, we'll keep a good thought."
"RORY: Hey, here's a picture of Kirk pinned by the casket."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, that's a good one."
"RORY: Man, it's bad enough this had to happen, but his pants splitting on top of it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I hope he never takes too close a look at his life."
"RORY: Amen. So this goes on the fridge, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, absolutely."
"RORY: Good."
"CUT TO BUS"
"[Rory is on her way to school. The bus stops and several people get off, and she notices Jess sitting in the back. She walks over to him]"
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Can I sit?"
"JESS: Uh, sure, sit. I thought you took an earlier bus."
"RORY: My first class got canceled today."
"JESS: Oh. So what's been going on?"
"RORY: Nothing much. Fran died."
"JESS: I heard."
"RORY: I went to her funeral yesterday."
"JESS: Luke went, too."
"RORY: I saw him there."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: He was in the back."
"JESS: I can't go to the prom. I couldn't get tickets."
"RORY: Oh."
"JESS: Sorry."
"[the bus stops]"
"RORY: This is my stop."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: So, you'll call me?"
"JESS: Yeah, I'll call you."
"[Rory gets off the bus. Jess pulls a book out of a large duffel bag and the bus pulls away]"

"OPEN AT WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table with books spread open in front of them]"
"LORELAI: ""Where's the ladies room?"" ""More coffee, please."" ""Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"""
"RORY: We do not need to know how to say ""Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"""
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, we do."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: When we're in Spain, we need to know how to say, ""Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"" When in France, ""Does Johnny Depp live near here?"""
"RORY: When in Rome, ""Does Gore Vidal live near here?"""
"LORELAI: You know, you look like me, yet my ways are completely lost on you. Come on, honey, put that down. You've been studying all day."
"RORY: I can't put it down, I've got finals coming up."
"LORELAI: I know you have finals coming up, but you also have a piece of pie sitting there that you've been completely ignoring."
"RORY: Just let me get to the end of this chapter."
"LORELAI: Oh, fine. Hey, how important do you think it is to be able to say, ""Help, I'm bleeding from the head""?"
"RORY: Just bring the phrase books."
"LORELAI: No. If we learn all the phrases we need, then the phrase books are one less thing we have to lug around."
"RORY: We will never be able to learn all the phrases in every language that we're going to need. Bring the books."
"LORELAI: We can learn enough. Plus, doesn't everybody speak English over there anyway?"
"RORY: Ugly American, party of one."
"LORELAI: Fine, we'll bring the books."
"RORY: Okay, five minutes for pie."
"LORELAI: Finally."
"[Lane walks in and sits down with them]"
"LANE: They're here, I've got them."
"LORELAI: You've got what?"
"LANE: The brochures for my college."
"RORY: You seem chipper."
"LANE: I am. I have decided to make this whole Seventh Day Adventist College experience a good one. I'm gonna look on the bright side, find the silver lining, and make myself some lemonade."
"LORELAI: Well, good for you."
"RORY: The campus looks pretty."
"LORELAI: Very pretty."
"LANE: It's got two huge parks with gardens and lakes."
"LORELAI: Two parks."
"LANE: One for boys and one for girls."
"RORY: Huh."
"LANE: And you know, I had originally thought that this was gonna be a suffocating place with out of date rules and insane restrictions, but boy was I wrong. For example, curfew is up to 9:30. 9:45 if you're going for your Masters. Makeup will be permitted, as long as it identically matches your skin tone. And owning a Rolling Stones CD is no longer grounds for expulsion. You can work the demerits off in the campus clean-up crew."
"LORELAI: There's a separate park for boys?"
"LANE: My life is over."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, no, I didn't say that."
"LANE: You didn't have to. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Well, it is over."
"RORY: It's not over."
"LORELAI: Every kid in that brochure was awkward and panicked. It looked like the Academy Award audience during Michael Moore's speech."
"RORY: Hey, why don't you add the phrase ""Just sit there and look pretty"" to that list of yours there, okay? I've gotta go back to studying."
"LORELAI: ""Does that sexy guy in the Peugeot ad who had a bit part in Armageddon live near here?"""
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks down the steps carrying her shoes. She quietly walks to the kitchen and fills up the coffeepot with water, then walks over to the coffee maker as Rory walks out of her bedroom]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: [startled] Oh! Oh, God, Rory, you scared me."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: I've been sneaking around here like an idiot trying not to wake you up."
"RORY: I've been up for hours."
"LORELAI: Why? Did you have a bad dream? The one where you finally meet Christiane Amanpour and she's really stupid?"
"RORY: No, I realized last night that at this rate, I will never finish all the work I have to do."
"LORELAI: What work?"
"RORY: What work? What work, she asks."
"LORELAI: Well, you know me and that dippy Christiane, takes a little while to catch up."
"RORY: Here. [hands her a list]"
"LORELAI: Things to do before graduation. A list, of course. Study for finals, senior breakfast, senior awards, finish final edition of the Franklin, organize a new student government, convince Paris to give up student gavel."
"RORY: Oh, and I forgot - man the yearbook distribution table this afternoon at the stupid Senior Palooza. Unbelievable."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll be manning the Booster Club Grad Night table at the same time, so we can feel stupid and abused together."
"RORY: I can't finish all this and sleep at the same time."
"LORELAI: You have to sleep, it's what keeps you pretty."
"RORY: Who cares if I'm pretty if I fail my finals?"
"LORELAI: Okay, you've got this so completely backwards. What is all this?"
"RORY: Hm? Oh, I found that if I focus too much on one subject, I start to get a little punchy. This way, when I hit Bolshevik Revolution overload, I just shift over here and, oh, hello, Anne Boleyn is going down, and then when that gets too depressing, it's right over to calculus."
"LORELAI: Saving the party subject for last, huh?"
"RORY: This shifting back and forth seems to produce better results."
"LORELAI: I think you're pushing yourself too hard."
"RORY: I made out a schedule. Every single moment of every single day from now until graduation is accounted for."
"LORELAI: You left off the Kiwanis Luncheon."
"RORY: I did? Are you sure?"
"LORELAI: It's on Monday."
"RORY: How could I forget the Kiwanis Luncheon? They gave me their scholarship."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, a two hundred and fifty dollar scholarship. That'll keep you in microwave popcorn for a week."
"RORY: I'll just have to move something around. And I'll have to work Grandma in."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Grandma called and asked if I could come over and help her pick out a dress to wear to my graduation."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: I have to."
"LORELAI: Rory, my mother's been dressing herself for years and she has yet to show up at a function with her bra on the outside of her clothing."
"RORY: She asked, I can't say no."
"LORELAI: Tell her about the koala bears. She'll understand."
"[Luke appears at the back door window and waves to get Lorelai's attention]"
"RORY: Please stop making fun of them. We need every cent we can get. Yale is expensive."
"LORELAI: I know Yale is expensive."
"RORY: Well, we haven't heard from Yale financial aid yet."
"[Luke gestures for Lorelai to come outside]"
"LORELAI: We will, relax."
"RORY: Well, we had better hear from them soon because I have a deposit to send in for my room and I have a bunch of supplies to buy and I wanna get all of that out of the way before we go to Europe, otherwise I'll be obsessing about it the entire time."
"LORELAI: Okay, uh, listen, I'm gonna go out and get the paper."
"RORY: Okay, well, don't show it to me because I have no time for recreational reading until June."
"LORELAI: Hey, could we move your, uh, chill session from four o'clock tomorrow afternoon to, uh, right now? That'd be great, thanks."
"[Lorelai walks out the back door where Luke is waiting for her]"
"LORELAI: Okay, um, little tip - the whole stalking thing works infinitely better when you don't actually smash your face in the window."
"LUKE: I need to talk to you."
"LORELAI: Come inside."
"LUKE: No, Rory's in there."
"LORELAI: Since when are you scared of Rory? 'Cause seriously, Luke, I think you can take her."
"LUKE: I just need to tell you something. Can she hear us?"
"LORELAI: Through the walls? No, I put some kryptonite in her waffles. We're good."
"LUKE: Come over here."
"LORELAI: You're freaking out the freaks this morning."
"LUKE: Jess is gone."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: And I don't think he's coming back."
"LORELAI: What do you mean gone? Like gone gone?"
"LUKE: Exactly like gone gone."
"LORELAI: But when?"
"LUKE: Last night, this morning, I don't know. I went up there to get some money out of the safe and I noticed that all of his stuff was gone."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, forget it. I'm through with him. He's eighteen, he can do whatever the hell he wants. He's on his own, I'm through."
"LORELAI: Luke."
"LUKE: No, it's a relief. That kid was driving me crazy. Let him make his own way from now on. Let him see how far that smart mouth of his gets him without someone watching his back. I couldn't be more relieved. I'm just worried about Rory. I assume she doesn't know."
"LORELAI: She hasn't said anything."
"LUKE: I can tell her if you want me to."
"LORELAI: No, it's okay. I can do it. I just have to figure out when. She's got a lot of things on her mind right now."
"LUKE: Well, don't wait too long. She'll notice eventually."
"LORELAI: Yes, okay. Well, thanks for coming over."
"LUKE: No problem."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: I failed him."
"LORELAI: You did not fail him. You supported him, you defended him, you gave him a chance, and if he chose not to take it, there's nothing more you could do."
"LUKE: Yeah. Well, I should go."
"LORELAI: Do you have any idea where he went?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I got a pretty good idea."
"[Luke leaves. Lorelai walks back into the house through the front door, and Rory walks up to her]"
"RORY: Hey, there is no chill time scheduled for four o'clock tomorrow, and the one thing I really don't have time for are your jokes, missy. [walks back to kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Later's good."
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess gets off a bus and starts walking down the street]"
"MAN: Do you need some help, friend?"
"JESS: Nope."
"MAN: Lived here 25 years. I can certainly point you in a direction, make your journey easier. [Jess walks away] Enjoy this beautiful day."
"JESS: [to himself] I'll have the alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast."
"[Jess stands on the beach and watches the ocean]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai pulls up and checks the mailbox. She opens a letter.]"
"CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is on the phone in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Yes, I've been holding for Mr. Hennings. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. . .oh, great, hi. Listen, um, I just received this letter saying that my daughter did not qualify for financial aid. Rory Gilmore. . .Uh huh. . .Okay, yes, we did recently receive seventy-five thousand dollars, but, uh, here's the thing - that money is gone. I gave it to my parents, so I don't have it anymore, I swear. You could come over here and search me. We could open a bottle of wine and put on some Motown and. . . Uh, yes, that was very inappropriate. Look, um, I owed my parents that money because they helped me put Rory through Chilton, and I wanted her to go to Chilton so that she could get into. . .well, Harvard, but then Harvard became Yale - long story - and now that she's gotten into Yale, I paid them back for Chilton. Just kind of a funny, wacky circle we could all laugh about someday. . . Yes, but, since I don't have the money anymore, it just seems like it shouldn't count. There must be something we can do. I mean, Rory is the most deserving kid there is, just seriously. You know, I don't know if you know the Kiwanis, but they gave her their scholarship and. . .mmhmm. . .I understand. . .okay. . .well, we'll just have to figure something out. . . thank you. Goodbye."
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess walks up to a house. He starts to walk through the front gate, but a bunch of dogs run up and start barking at him.]"
"JESS: Hey! Hello, is anybody home? Hey!"
"[a woman is standing on the roof of the house]"
"SASHA: [to dogs] Pipe down! [to Jess] You selling something?"
"JESS: No. Does Jimmy Mariano live here?"
"SASHA: Does he owe you money?"
"JESS: No, I'm his. . .Jess. I'm Jess."
"SASHA: Jess?"
"[a dog starts barking]"
"JESS: Jess Marian -"
"SASHA: Frodo, back off now! I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
"JESS: I just wanna see Jimmy, okay?"
"SASHA: Hey, did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?"
"JESS: Yes."
"SASHA: Remember when they go to the Emerald City and they ring the bell and the guy with the beard stuck his head out and they said that they wanted to see the wizard, and he said no, and they said, 'She's got the ruby slippers', and he said 'Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.'"
"JESS: Yes."
"SASHA: Well, I'm the guy with the beard and I'm saying the no unless you can come up with the ruby slippers."
"JESS: I'm his son."
"SASHA: His son?"
"JESS: Yes, his son."
"SASHA: Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in."
"JESS: Do they bite?"
"SASHA: Just those two. [walks away]"
"JESS: Which two? Hey, which two? Great. I swear I will bite you back."
"[He walks into the yard. The woman walks over to greet him]"
"SASHA: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming."
"JESS: Neither did I."
"SASHA: I'm Sasha. This is Angus, Chowder, Rufus, Legolas, Caligula, Mudball, General Lee, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and Spot. Jimmy's not here right now."
"JESS: Okay, well, I can just hang out, walk around for awhile. Just tell me what time he gets home."
"SASHA: Why don't you come in? I'll call his work."
"JESS: Oh, well. . ."
"[they walk inside]"
"JESS: You have a lot of pets."
"SASHA: Ah, they're not all mine."
"JESS: No?"
"SASHA: No, some of 'em followed me home, some of 'em hang out, some of 'em just needed a place to crash. They drive Jimmy crazy, actually, but what can you do? Someone's gotta take care of 'em, right? I'm just gonna try and track him down, so just wander."
"[Sasha walks to a phone and picks it up]"
"SASHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. [she dials a number] Okay. Lee, hi, I'm looking for Jimmy. . . okay, I'll hold. . ."
"[Jess looks around the house]"
"JESS: Clowns, cats, dogs. I wonder where his tap shoes are."
"[He walks into another room and looks around. He opens a cabinet door and finds a young girl reading inside]"
"JESS: Whoa!"
"[Sasha comes to the doorway]"
"SASHA: He wasn't at work, but his guy said he'll be back any second. Lil, Koko's gonna come over and stay with you while I'm gone, okay? And put those books back in there when you're done, I mean it. Ready?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"LILY: Hey. . . the door."
"JESS: Sorry."
"[Jess shuts the cabinet door and leaves]"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Louise and Madeline are talking in the hallway]"
"LOUISE: Shut up."
"MADELINE: I swear."
"LOUISE: Jean jackets are out? How is that possible?"
"MADELINE: I just opened the magazine and there it was."
"LOUISE: This is horrible. Who decides these things?"
"MADELINE: Marie Claire, apparently."
"[Rory walks over]"
"LOUISE: I feel so helpless. Did you hear? Jean jackets are out."
"RORY: Out of where?"
"MADELINE: Vogue."
"LOUISE: No, Marie Claire."
"MADELINE: Whatever. We still can't wear them."
"RORY: Oh, you guys, thank you so much for passing out the yearbooks for me. I really need the study time."
"LOUISE: No problem."
"RORY: Do you want me to at least help you bring the boxes in?"
"MADELINE: Oh, we've got that taken care of."
"[Two guys walk by carrying some boxes]"
"BOY: Halfway through."
"LOUISE: Yeah, well, hurry up, 'cause we need to get started."
"MADELINE: God, he carries those boxes sexy."
"[Rory's cell phone rings]"
"RORY: [answers] Hello?"
"EMILY: Rory, you haven't returned my calls."
"RORY: Oh, Grandma, I'm so sorry. I've been really busy."
"EMILY: I don't care how busy you get, young lady, you have to call your grandmother back."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"EMILY: I won't be around forever, you know."
"RORY: I'm really sorry."
"EMILY: When are you coming over? I need to discuss what to wear to your graduation. I thought about a suit."
"RORY: A suit seems nice."
"EMILY: But perhaps it's too formal."
"RORY: Formal's fine."
"EMILY: Well, what are your friends' families wearing?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"EMILY: Can you find out?"
"RORY: Um, sure, hold on. [to Louise] Louise, what's your grandmother wearing to graduation?"
"LOUISE: Hopefully the pearls I get when she kicks."
"RORY: [to Emily] Why don't I just come over?"
"EMILY: Oh, that would be wonderful. Today?"
"RORY: Yes, as soon as I can get away."
"EMILY: And bring a color swatch of your cap and gown so I don't clash."
"RORY: Bye, Grandma."
"[Rory hangs up, then dials a number]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: I just got another call from Grandma."
"LORELAI: Rory, no."
"RORY: I'm gonna go over there now."
"LORELAI: And leave me here alone?"
"RORY: Where are you? I can't even see you."
"LORELAI: I'm over here by the Old Spice ad."
"[Rory walks to the doorway of the cafeteria and sees Lorelai across the room]"
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi. Come over."
"RORY: I have to go."
"LORELAI: You can't come over and talk for one second?"
"RORY: The minute I walk into that room, I'm suddenly gonna have to sign yearbooks, and since I'm severely crunched for time, I'm gonna have to resort to classic clams like, ""Hey, have a good summer. Let's keep in touch. Best friends forever,"" and I do not wanna be that person. Plus, Paris will immediately shanghai me and give me a million things to do."
"LORELAI: You know what, you need to stop being intimidated by that girl. You're going to college for God's sake. You need to be able to stand up for yourself and say, you know, ""Paris, go. . ."""
"[Paris walks up behind her]"
"PARIS: Hey."
"LORELAI: Paris!"
"PARIS: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I was just. . .the phone rang. . .your hair is really shiny."
"PARIS: We're not even set up yet. The box isn't out, the tickets aren't in order. Where's the list?"
"LORELAI: Uh, it's uh. . .in my purse."
"PARIS: Well, terrific. I can't think of a better place for the list to be except, oh, maybe out here on the table where we could actually look at it."
"LORELAI: Your hair is really shiny."
"PARIS: I'm going to go make the rounds. I'll be back in a minute. Have you seen Rory?"
"LORELAI: No."
"PARIS: I'll go look outside."
"[Paris walks away]"
"LORELAI: [to Rory on phone] Run, run, run!"
"RORY: Okay, I'm gonna be at Grandma's for about an hour. Can you pick me up?"
"LORELAI: If Paris hasn't had me flogged, then yes, I'll be there."
"RORY: Thank you. Bye."
"[they hang up]"
"LORELAI: Please, God, tell me I didn't forget the list."
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess and Sasha are walking down the street]"
"JESS: So the kid in the bookcase back there. . ."
"SASHA: Lily."
"JESS: Is she yours?"
"SASHA: Mine, yes. Not Jimmy's."
"JESS: Oh."
"SASHA: I was married for the longest minute and a half in the world and. . .[to woman walking by] . . .hey sweetie, how's everything?"
"WOMAN: Everything's fine."
"SASHA: I love that. Give Riley a kiss. [to Jess] Then I came to my senses and ran for the hills but I got Lily so I win, ha ha. Short cut. Anyhow, I met Jimmy about five and a half years ago, but Lily's just crazy about him, so. . .[to man] . . . Ronnie, I found your keys again."
"RONNIE: Oh, good. Thank you, baby doll."
"SASHA: You have got to sew that hole in your pocket up, I mean it. Today, drop your coat by my house. I'll do it for you if you don't have the time. [to Jess] Got any brothers or sisters?"
"JESS: Apparently not."
"SASHA: Lily submitted a written request for a brother by the end of this year, but I think I should be married before we have any kids."
"JESS: You guys aren't married."
"SASHA: You didn't know that."
"JESS: No."
"SASHA: You guys had quite a talk, didn't you?"
"JESS: Yeah, well."
"SASHA: Okay, we're here."
"CUT TO HOT DOG STAND"
"[Jimmy and a worker are looking at a jar of pickles]"
"JIMMY: Well."
"LEE: It looks like a jar of pickles."
"JIMMY: I know it's a jar of pickles, but is it that jar of pickles?"
"LEE: Yes."
"JIMMY: You're sure."
"LEE: No."
"JIMMY: Look, the Chicago dills were the original pickles they sold here back in 1922."
"LEE: 1922. Yes, I listen."
"JIMMY: Now I finally tracked down the family that sold them, I paid a substantial premium to use the original labels, I waited weeks for them to arrive, and now they're here and I look at them and they don't look the same. Too many bumps."
"LEE: Jimmy, I'm begging you, play golf."
"JIMMY: Just call the guy and tell them they look different, please."
"LEE: Whatever you say."
"[Sasha and Jess walk up to the stand]"
"SASHA: Jimmy."
"JIMMY: Hey Sash."
"SASHA: You have a visitor."
"JIMMY: Yeah?"
"JESS: Hey."
"JIMMY: Hey. You, uh, just get here?"
"JESS: Just got here."
"SASHA: So, Jess, I assume you'll be staying for dinner?"
"JESS: Oh, well. . ."
"JIMMY: Yeah, sure, stay. You'll stay. He'll stay. We'll get Abbott's, right?"
"SASHA: Whatever you want. Well, I have to get back, so I will see you guys later. [leaves]"
"JESS: Sorry I didn't call."
"JIMMY: Hey, life's about the spontaneous, right?"
"JESS: This your place?"
"JIMMY: The Inferno. . .yes."
"JESS: It's nice."
"JIMMY: Thanks. Hey, why don't I come out there?"
"JESS: Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your work."
"JIMMY: No problem. Hey Lee, I'm gonna take a break for awhile."
"LEE: Thank God."
"[Jimmy walks out of the hot dog stand and over to Jess]"
"JESS: You didn't have to do that."
"JIMMY: It's fine. So, first time on the West Coast?"
"JESS: First time on the West Coast."
"JIMMY: Okay. The sites. Ocean."
"JESS: I wondered what that was."
"JIMMY: Sand."
"JESS: Keeps the ocean in its place."
"JIMMY: Sky."
"JESS: We've got one of those back east."
"JIMMY: And then you have the boardwalk. Sunglasses, smoothies, bootlegged CD's."
"JESS: Good ones?"
"JIMMY: Not bad, I guess. I never actually bought one. My neighbor Stan did. He's not my neighbor anymore. He used to work at Lockheed, but they shut down the Burbank plant, so he went to a trade school out in the valley. He installs cable now. Sends me a postcard at Christmas time. He's Dutch. Currently, we're in Santa Monica. You keep walking, you hit Venice - that's technically where we live. Past that, you got Marina Del Rey - lotta bike shots in that area. And then you're getting near the beaches - Manhattan, Redondo, and basically that's it."
"JESS: That's it. That's all of LA."
"JIMMY: Well, there are these crazy rumors that if you get in your car and you actually drive east away from the beach, there's some city and other stuff, but personally I don't believe it."
"JESS: I take it you like the beach."
"JIMMY: I would marry the beach if man and property were allowed to mate."
"JESS: Sounds serious."
"JIMMY: I've lived a lot of places all over this country, and nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to this."
"JESS: So where else have you lived?"
"JIMMY: What, where else? Let's see. Minneapolis, Chicago, Biloxi, Maine - worked on a lobster boat."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"JIMMY: Yeah. Let me tell you, I smelled great. Did a stint in New Jersey, New Hampshire..."
"JESS: New York?"
"JIMMY: Oh, yeah, well, obviously, New York. New York was. . .well, you know what New York was, so. . ."
"JESS: Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: Yeah?"
"JESS: I didn't come here to bust your balls, man."
"JIMMY: Okay, good to know."
"LEE: [calls from hot dog stand] Jimmy, I got the pickle guy. He's as worried about you as I am."
"JIMMY: I should take this."
"JESS: Go ahead. I can just hang out."
"JIMMY: You sure?"
"JESS: I got my book, I'm good."
"JIMMY: Okay, you're good."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings and the maid opens the front door. Rory is on the porch]"
"RORY: Hi, I'm here to see my grandmother."
"MAID: She's in the living room with Miss Celine."
"RORY: With who?"
"MAID: Right this way."
"[In the living room, there are clothes everywhere. Emily is wearing an evening gown and is checking herself in the mirror]"
"MISS CELINE: It's stunning."
"EMILY: Really?"
"MISS CELINE: Chills, I've got chills. Turn for me, dear. Oh, it moves, it just moves. Ginger Rogers always insisted her dresses move just like that."
"EMILY: Ginger Rogers, well."
"MISS CELINE: Of course, she didn't have your legs."
"EMILY: Oh, Celine."
"RORY: Hey, Grandma."
"EMILY: Rory, perfect. What do you think?"
"RORY: You look beautiful."
"EMILY: Well, if I do, it's all because of this lady here. Rory, I'd like you to meet Miss Celine. She's been our fashion consultant for years."
"RORY: Oh, well, how do you -"
"MISS CELINE: Oh my God, it's Audrey Hepburn."
"RORY: What?"
"MISS CELINE: You're Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina. Just a waif with eyes."
"RORY: Uh, thank you."
"RICHARD: Celine, I don't think the handkerchief works with this. Oh, Rory, I didn't know you were here."
"MISS CELINE: Richard, look at this girl, what do you see?"
"RICHARD: Well. . ."
"MISS CELINE: It's Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina."
"RICHARD: Hm, now that you mention it, there is a touch of Audrey in her."
"EMILY: But even prettier."
"MISS CELINE: Yes, without that ridiculous affected accent. For years I kept telling her, ""Audrey, get a speech therapist."" She was very stubborn. But could she wear capris."
"EMILY: You know, Rory is starting Yale in the fall."
"MISS CELINE: Yale, that is exciting. You'll need a whole new wardrobe, huh?"
"EMILY: Oh, Celine, I love this one."
"MISS CELINE: Yes, I had that exact suit made in mint for Mrs. Walter Cronkite just last week. A darling woman. We've been friends since the Big Bang."
"RORY: Uh, that's nice."
"EMILY: What do you think of this, Richard?"
"RICHARD: Well, I like the green one with the beads. It made you look like a mermaid."
"RORY: But you guys know that this is just a casual graduation. Folding chairs on the grass."
"MISS CELINE: There's going to be grass?"
"RORY: Well, yeah, it's going to be outside."
"MISS CELINE: Oh, you cannot wear green around grass. I learned that from Tova Borgnine the hard way. Go try the red one on. Red goes wonderful with nature."
"EMILY: All right."
"RICHARD: I'm gonna try the grey linen."
"MISS CELINE: Ah, yes, yes, with this white silk shirt."
"RICHARD: Oh, very nice."
"MISS CELINE: Yes, I had that exact shirt on Jimmy Stewart the night before his colonoscopy. He came through it clean as a whistle."
"RICHARD: Hm, hm."
"MISS CELINE: Never underestimate the power of a good shirt."
"RORY: I never will again."

"[Louise and Madeline are at the yearbook distribution table handing out yearbooks]"
"MADELINE: Kathy Kim."
"LOUISE: Check."
"[Madeline takes a yearbook from the stack, rips a page out, then hands the yearbook to the student]"
"MADELINE: Next. Greg Agulara."
"LOUISE: Check."
"[Madeline rips a page out of another yearbook and hands the yearbook to him]"
"MADELINE: Next. Brad Langford."
"LOUISE: Check."
"[Madeline rips a page out of another yearbook and hands the yearbook to Brad]"
"BRAD: Why did you do that?"
"LOUISE: It has a really bad picture of us on it."
"BRAD: Yeah, but that page had the only picture of me in the entire book."
"MADELINE: Oh. [looks at the ripped-out page, then rips off a picture and hands it to him.] There. Next."
"[pan to Lorelai and Paris sitting at the Grad Night ticket table]"
"PARIS: No one is going to buy our tickets."
"LORELAI: Give it time, Paris."
"PARIS: We've been sitting here for an hour and have sold eight tickets."
"LORELAI: Grad Night is a big deal, Paris. They will buy the tickets."
"PARIS: Unbutton your top."
"LORELAI: What?"
"PARIS: Teenage boys are controlled by one thing. Unbutton your top."
"LORELAI: No."
"PARIS: Well, me doing it isn't going to help any."
"LORELAI: Paris, you need to relax. You need to stop worrying. You need to stop obsessing. You need to stop looking at my boobs."
"PARIS: Fine. Oh, man, even the stupid class poster table has a line."
"LORELAI: Okay, time to play ""Let's distract Paris."" Look at me. Let's talk."
"PARIS: About what?"
"LORELAI: Anything. Tell me what college you finally landed on."
"PARIS: I didn't."
"LORELAI: Well, what's it between?"
"PARIS: Princeton, Columbia, and Yale."
"LORELAI: Good choices."
"PARIS: I'm really not that interested in Columbia, but the thought of me going there horrifies my mother so I have to keep it in the mix, you know?"
"LORELAI: Do I ever."
"PARIS: Princeton's a good school, but Jamie goes there."
"LORELAI: That's your boyfriend?"
"PARIS: Yes. He goes there, and if I go there, it's going to look like I went there just to be with him. Suddenly I'm Felicity without the hair issues and I'm not terribly comfortable with that."
"LORELAI: But look at it like this - not going to a school you wanna go to just because your boyfriend is there is just as bad as going to a school you don't wanna go to just because your boyfriend isn't there."
"PARIS: I guess."
"LORELAI: If you wanna go to Princeton, go to Princeton. If you wanna go to Yale, go to Yale. Leave Jamie out of it. Leave your mother out of it. Just decide whatever it is you wanna do and do it."
"PARIS: I can try that, I guess. Thanks."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"[Lorelai leans forward to hug Paris]"
"PARIS: Uh, what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm giving you a hug."
"PARIS: Why?"
"LORELAI: Just give into it, baby. Come on, you can do it. That a girl. Unclench the fists, Paris. Unclench the fists. Yeah, there you go."

"[Jimmy and Jess walk into Jimmy's house]"
"JIMMY: Sash, I'm home!"
"[he walks to a cabinet to put his hat away. Lily is inside reading a book]"
"JIMMY: What's up, Lily-Lou? Want some pineapple on your pizza?"
"LILY: Yes."
"JIMMY: Yes. [closes the cabinet door]"
"JESS: Does she do that a lot?"
"JIMMY: All the time."
"JESS: You ever find it a little weird?"
"JIMMY: All the time. Uh, listen, why don't you give me a minute here."
"JESS: Okay."
"JIMMY: Make it two, two minutes. Three, and do a special knock before you come in, maybe a -"
"JESS: I'll tell you what, I passed a bookstore back on the boardwalk, why don't I just go check it out for awhile?"
"JIMMY: Okay. But I thought the knock idea was kind of cool."
"[Jess leaves. Jimmy walks into the kitchen where Sasha is sitting on the counter]"
"SASHA: So, last week when you said you were going to Sacramento to check out a potential supplier, you actually went. . ."
"JIMMY: To Connecticut to see Jess."
"SASHA: That was quite an elaborate story you made up."
"JIMMY: Well, I do have a gift."
"SASHA: Of course I didn't believe you."
"JIMMY: Okay, it's not a big gift, but . . ."
"SASHA: Why didn't you tell me?"
"JIMMY: I don't know. You're nodding your head. Why are you nodding your head? You're shrugging your shoulders. You're nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders. Why are you nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders? Will you stop nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders? Sasha, come on."
"SASHA: I'm gonna pick up the pizza."
"JIMMY: Just have it delivered."
"SASHA: The delivery guys are too stoned after six to find the house, it'll take forever."
"JIMMY: I didn't know how it was gonna go, okay? I didn't know if he was even gonna be there or if he was gonna wanna talk to me or slug me or -"
"SASHA: I get it."
"JIMMY: Sash."
"SASHA: I'll see you later, roomie."
"JIMMY: Do not do that. We are not roomies. We are partners, we're soul mates."
"SASHA: You just traveled cross-country to see your son for the first time since he was born and you didn't tell me. We are roomies."
"JIMMY: I'm sorry."
"SASHA: Get the extra mattress out of the closet."
"JIMMY: What for?"
"SASHA: For Jess."
"JIMMY: For Jess to do what?"
"SASHA: For Jess to sleep on."
"JIMMY: Jess is sleeping here?"
"SASHA: Isn't he?"
"JIMMY: I don't know."
"SASHA: Jimmy, you didn't ask him if he's staying the night?"
"JIMMY: No."
"SASHA: Well, did you ask him how long he's here for?"
"JIMMY: No."
"SASHA: Did you ask him anything?"
"JIMMY: Should I have?"
"SASHA: Jimmy, he could be in trouble."
"JIMMY: What, he's in trouble? What kind of trouble?"
"SASHA: How would I know what kind of trouble?"
"JIMMY: Well, you're the one that just said he was in trouble."
"SASHA: I said he could be in trouble. He could be running from the cops, or attempting to hop across America on one foot, or he really did come all the way from Connecticut just to have pizza with his father who he's not seen or heard from in seventeen years."
"JIMMY: What are the odds it's the last one?"
"SASHA: Do what you want. Talk to him, don't talk to him, I am not your mother. I don't care. I'll be back. Lily, come on."

"[Rory and Miss Celine are sitting in the living room]"
"MISS CELINE: Now, Sabrina, college is a very important time in a young girl's life. You need to be properly attired."
"RORY: I'm sure, but -"
"MISS CELINE: Trust me, a young girl is completely and solely judged by her appearance. All right, let's begin. I always start every wardrobe from the top. The hat. Remember Sabrina, it's the first thing that God sees when you walk outside in the morning."
"[Emily walks down the steps into the living room]"
"EMILY: Well, I'm exhausted. I feel as if I've tried on every dress in town."
"RORY: So is it the blue?"
"EMILY: Yes, I think it's the blue. I think it's quite suitable for my granddaughter's graduation."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Hi hon, hi Mom."
"RORY: Hey."
"EMILY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: I just came to pick Rory up. Miss Celine."
"MISS CELINE: Oh my God, it's Natalie Wood! Look Sabrina, it's Natalie Wood."
"LORELAI: Oh, Miss Celine, I can't believe it, you're still. . .uh, working."
"MISS CELINE: Oh, I tried to retire once. Olivia deHavilland wouldn't hear of it."
"LORELAI: Well, how are you? How's Mrs. Walter Cronkite."
"MISS CELINE: Lovely. Thank you for asking, Natalie."
"EMILY: I left the suits upstairs. I'll just go up and get them."
"MISS CELINE: No, no, I'll get them. It's who I am, the keeper of the clothes. Delight to see you again."
"LORELAI: Same here, Celine."
"[Celine goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, she was like a thousand when I was ten, I can't believe it."
"RORY: You should've seen all the clothes that Grandma tried on today."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"RORY: She picked out a beautiful blue dress for graduation."
"LORELAI: Aw, I'd like to see that, Mom."
"EMILY: It needs to be altered."
"LORELAI: Oh, sure. I'll see it at graduation, I guess. So I'm sorry I didn't give you advanced notice that I was coming over."
"EMILY: I don't need advanced notice, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay, you just seem tense."
"EMILY: No, I'm just tired. And busy. I have a very busy evening ahead of me."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure you do."
"[the maid comes to the doorway]"
"MAID: Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: No, it's not."
"MAID: I just checked it and it's -"
"EMILY: I was in there ten minutes ago and it still had another forty minutes to go."
"MAID: But it's really brown and -"
"EMILY: Lupe, please do not argue with me. It's not ready. Now go in there and make the salad. What?"
"MAID: The salad's ready."
"EMILY: Lupe!"
"[the maid walks away]"
"LORELAI: Mom, it's seven o'clock."
"EMILY: So?"
"LORELAI: That's your dinnertime."
"EMILY: I don't have a dinnertime, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You don't have a dinnertime?"
"EMILY: No, I don't."
"LORELAI: So all the years I grew up in this house, we did not sit down to dinner at exactly seven o'clock every single night?"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: I just imagined that?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, I don't know what your obsession with dinnertime is."
"LORELAI: My obsession with dinnertime is that it was always at seven o'clock, now all of a sudden, it's not. Is it because I'm here?"
"EMILY: That's ridiculous."
"LORELAI: It is. I'm here, and if you served dinner, Miss Manners would insist that you invite me to stay and you don't want to, so you're going to pretend that dinner is suddenly whenever you feel like it."
"EMILY: Lorelai, do not get dramatic. Dinner is not ready, and even if it was, I would still not be able to invite you to stay because your father and I have plans tonight. We are eating quickly and then leaving."
"LORELAI: To go where?"
"EMILY: The Thompsons."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"EMILY: Book club."
"LORELAI: What book?"
"EMILY: Lovely Bones."
"LORELAI: Did you like it?"
"EMILY: It's not my taste but I respect the attempt."
"LORELAI: Now I know where I get it from."
"EMILY: We'll have dinner another time, all right?"
"LORELAI: Uh, so, are you kicking us out?"
"EMILY: I told you, we have plans."
"LORELAI: Or do you just wanna get that dinner of yours that's been ready for ten minutes now on the table?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, please."
"LORELAI: Tell me this - if I couldn't stay but Rory could, would you want her to?"
"EMILY: Of course I would, but as I told you, your father and I have plans."
"LORELAI: So she can't stay even if I'm gone?"
"EMILY: No, she can't."
"[Richard comes to the doorway]"
"RICHARD: Emily, for heaven's sake, it's 7:10. Why aren't we eating?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hi, Dad. Listen, um, Rory was gonna stay for dinner if you guys don't have plans."
"RICHARD: Of course we don't have any plans. Oh, I'm thrilled, Rory is staying. You just livened up a very boring night in the Gilmore house."
"LORELAI: Enjoy your dinner. And Mom, get yourself an agent 'cause you're wasting that talent of yours in dinner theater."
"RORY: Mom, wait."
"[Lorelai walks outside and Rory follows her]"
"RORY: Mom, wait. Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna drive in a circle backwards really fast to reverse the Earth's orbit to go back in time to before I made the insane decision to come here in the first place."
"RORY: You came here to pick me up."
"LORELAI: What was I thinking doing that?"
"RORY: You were thinking, 'Hey, wouldn't it be great for my daughter not to have to walk all the way back to Stars Hollow.'"
"LORELAI: Well, a thirty-mile hike never hurt anyone. God, I can't believe her."
"RORY: And I can't believe you."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: You were gonna leave me here?"
"LORELAI: So you could have dinner with them."
"RORY: I never said I wanted to have dinner with them. You said I wanted to have dinner with them, and then you stormed out."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm sorry. I just, I finally realized that I can't do this anymore. I can't come back here anymore, I'm done."
"RORY: Well, I'm sorry. I never should've asked you to pick me up."
"LORELAI: It's okay. It's good, actually. Now I can stop feeling guilty for not talking to them. I can go back to the way things were before. We share a nose and that's it."
"RORY: So we're going?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we're going."
"RORY: Okay, I have to go get my books. Please be here when I come back."
"[Rory walks back inside]"
"EMILY: Are you staying?"
"RORY: No, I have to go, Grandma."
"EMILY: All right, I guess we'll just see you at graduation then."
"RORY: I guess you will."
"EMILY: I swear, I don't know what to do with that mother of yours, I really don't. Everything has to be such a scene."
"RORY: I think you're being really stupid. [leaves]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory drive through the town square]"
"LORELAI: So, Souplantation. . ."
"RORY: Hang on, I'm almost at the end of this chapter. [pause] Okay, let the raving begin."
"LORELAI: A room full of all you can eat food. Soup, salad, pizza, pasta, chicken wings, ice cream, rainbow sprinkles. How did I not know about the rainbow sprinkles?"
"RORY: I have no good answers for you."
"LORELAI: We are going back with Tupperware."
"RORY: It's turning yellow."
"LORELAI: Ah, sh**t."
"RORY: Come on, g*n it."
"LORELAI: I can't."
"RORY: Mom, we have to get home."
"LORELAI: Rory, I already have two tickets. I cannot get another."
"[Lorelai stops the car at the red light]"
"RORY: Oh, I can't believe you stopped."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you wanted me to go."
"RORY: There's no one around."
"LORELAI: Now no one's around, but the second I run that light, a police car, four helicopters, the Canadian mounties and the crew of Cops jump out of a dumpster and I'm toast."
"RORY: Paranoid."
"LORELAI: Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, my friend."
"RORY: All right, I guess we wait."
"[They see Luke sweeping the sidewalk in front of the diner]"
"RORY: Do you think Luke will know we went to Souplantation?"
"LORELAI: Not unless you tell him."
"RORY: But maybe he'll be able to tell. They'll be a glow."
"LORELAI: An all-you-can-eat glow."
"RORY: He'll see the glow, he'll know we cheated, and he'll never give us extra fries again."
"[Luke sees them and runs inside]"
"RORY: Um, Mom, why did just bolt away from us?"
"LORELAI: Maybe he saw the glow."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Okay, first of all, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I just thought with all the stuff you were doing, maybe I should wait."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LORELAI: Jess is gone."
"RORY: Gone where?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Luke knows, but he didn't tell me. But he doesn't seem to think he's coming back."
"RORY: Neither do I."
"LORELAI: Are you okay?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Ugh, forget this."
"[Lorelai runs the red light and heads home. A police motorcycle pulls out and follows after her]"
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess is browsing in a bookstore when Jimmy walks up to him]"
"JIMMY: Hey, when you say 'I'm going to check out a bookstore on the boardwalk', you be more specific."
"JESS: What?"
"JIMMY: I have been wandering around for over an hour. I've been to three different bookstores. I have been worried sick about you, you hear me?"
"JESS: Sorry."
"JIMMY: Outside."
"JESS: But -"
"JIMMY: Outside."
"[they walk outside]"
"JIMMY: Are you in trouble?"
"JESS: What?"
"JIMMY: You know, when you left home, were the cops after you?"
"JESS: No."
"JIMMY: No 'cause they shouldn't be or no 'cause they haven't found the head yet?"
"JESS: What's up, Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: You just showed up here, man."
"JESS: I know I did."
"JIMMY: No call, no letter, just like -"
"JESS: Just like you showed up in Stars Hollow with no letter, no call."
"JIMMY: Hey."
"JESS: Were you in trouble?"
"JIMMY: We're not talking about me, we're talking about you."
"JESS: I'm not running from the cops."
"JIMMY: Then why are you here?"
"JESS: Why'd you come to Stars Hollow?"
"JIMMY: Hey, listen, Mr. Double-Talk, I need an answer here."
"JESS: Well, so do I. You show up, you don't talk to me, you don't say anything. You just have a cup of coffee, then you left. Why'd you come if you didn't even wanna talk to me?"
"JIMMY: I did wanna talk to you."
"JESS: You did?"
"JIMMY: Of course I wanted to talk to you. You think a person travels all the way across the country just to listen to a Bowie song? Granted, a classic off Ziggy, but still."
"JESS: So, what, you're telling me you just chickened out?"
"JIMMY: Yeah."
"JESS: Oh. Well, I came to see you."
"JIMMY: Okay."
"JESS: And I thought maybe I could crash here for a little while."
"JIMMY: Uh huh."
"JESS: Just a little while. I don't need my own room or anything. I can just sleep on the couch."
"JIMMY: Or the extra mattress we keep in the closet."
"JESS: Sure, that'd be fine, too."
"JIMMY: You know, Sasha's always right. It drives me crazy. No matter what the situation, she's always right."
"JESS: Jimmy."
"JIMMY: I'd love to be right just once in awhile, you know?"
"JESS: It wouldn't be for long."
"JIMMY: Do you know she called the Super Bowl five times in a row? Who does that? What is she, a witch?"
"JESS: You know what, say no if you want."
"JIMMY: Jess, man, come on, you can't stay here."
"JESS: Why not?"
"JIMMY: 'Cause you can't."
"JESS: Why not?"
"JIMMY: 'Cause you can't."
"JESS: Why not?"
"JIMMY: Because you can't."
"JESS: Well, I'd ask ""why not"" but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere."
"JIMMY: Look at me, Jess. I'm not a father. I was never a father. I left you because I wasn't a father. I mean it, the minute the cigar was finished, I was like, ""What the hell are you doing? You can't take care of yourself. How are you gonna take care of someone else?"""
"JESS: That's not why -"
"JIMMY: I can't take you in, I can't raise you."
"JESS: Raise me? I'm eighteen! I'm raised. I can vote, I can be drafted. It's a little late to throw me a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle birthday party."
"JIMMY: I thought you didn't come here to bust my balls."
"JESS: I didn't."
"JIMMY: Well, then put the bat down, man."
"JESS: I don't need a daddy. I just need a place to crash."
"JIMMY: Do you even understand that it's only been the last five years that I've even started to put my life together? You don't wanna be around me. I am a screw-up. That is my genetic code."
"JESS: Well, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree."
"JIMMY: Don't say that. You're young, you can do anything you want."
"JESS: A month. Just let me stay a month."
"JIMMY: Are you listening? I have nothing to offer you. Nothing."
"JESS: You have nothing? I have nothing! I have no place to go. I can't stay at Luke's, I can't stay in Stars Hollow. My mother is a wackjob. I mean, you're saying you're this loser and what, you don't wanna take me off this terrific path I'm headed down right now? I'm not graduating high school. I don't know what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life, but something's telling me I better find out soon or I'm gonna be that guy out there on the boardwalk selling the hemp hats."
"JIMMY: I have one of those. It's a good hat."
"JESS: Well?"
"JIMMY: I have to talk it over with Sasha."
"JESS: Just tell her I'm a dog."
"JIMMY: Great idea. Maybe you can sit there and lick yourself while she decides, you know, help sell it."
"JESS: Thank you, Jimmy."
"JIMMY: If she says it's okay, then we'll see."
"JESS: Fine, we'll see."
"JIMMY: It may not work out."
"JESS: I totally understand."
"JIMMY: But I'll ask and if she says it's okay, then we'll see. We'll see."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door]"
"RORY: Oh my God, I'm so tired."
"LORELAI: Here's a crazy thought, how about going to bed?"
"RORY: I have to study."
"LORELAI: Or, better yet, make a pot of coffee and once again, get no sleep. Just as good."
"RORY: What's this?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's just. . .Yale needed my Social Security number for something."
"RORY: Oh."
"[Rory walks toward the kitchen. Lorelai looks through Rory's yearbook in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Look who became a soche."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You have a lot of signatures in here, little girl."
"RORY: Everybody signs everybody's yearbook. It's polite."
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Rory, have a great summer. BFF. Amber."" Hey, Amber BFF'ed you."
"RORY: Yeah, I feel truly blessed."
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Hey, Aurory Borealis."" Okay, can't talk to this one ever again. [reads] ""You have been my inspiration, my rock, my light. I loved you in South Pacific."" When did you do South Pacific?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Some dipstick named Shauna thinks you were in South Pacific."
"RORY: Oh, Shauna tends to get people mixed up."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay."
"[Lorelai looks at the yearbook some more, then walks to the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what's weird? A lot of the kids in here are calling you a valedictorian. Is that anything like a dirty skank, 'cause if it is I'll kick their plaid butts up and down the sidewalk. Were you named valedictorian?"
"RORY: Yes, and you know what that means? One more stupid speech that I have to write, that I have no time to write, but nevertheless, I have to write."
"LORELAI: Hey, listen, my little Holly Hunter in Broadcast News, I'm gonna let you freak out and study like a mad woman and stress yourself out until finals, but once they're over, we are gonna celebrate big time. . .'cause this is amazing."
"RORY: Yeah, it is."
"LORELAI: Okay, now go make Mommy nervous."

"OPEN IN TOWN SQUARE"
"[The troubadour starts playing a song. Lorelai and Rory push past him with large backpacks on their backs]"
"RORY: Coming through! Heavy packs."
"LORELAI: Out of our way, peace boy! No offense, love the song. Carry on. Go."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into Luke's Diner]"
"LORELAI: Ugh. And wuss patrol, halt."
"[they drop their backpacks on the floor]"
"RORY: I've never known such pain."
"LORELAI: We are so not walking around Europe with those annoying things on our backs."
"RORY: But we're backpacking through Europe. How're we gonna do this without backpacks?"
"LORELAI: But all the time we've talked about backpacking, I never actually pictured us with backpacks."
"RORY: Well, what were you picturing?"
"LORELAI: Spry, accommodating European men with neat mustaches trailing after us, carrying our luggage, hailing taxi cabs, constantly reminding us how beautiful we are."
"RORY: No, it's just the two of us humping our backpacks around."
"LORELAI: Well, at least my new walking shoes are all broken in. If you count broken skin, broken toes."
"[Luke walks over]"
"LUKE: Don't do that."
"LORELAI: Don't do what?"
"LUKE: Don't take your shoes off. This is a restaurant."
"LORELAI: I don't see a ""No shirt, no shoes, no service"" sign."
"LUKE: It's right here, don't do that."
"RORY: We're in pain, Luke."
"LUKE: But it's great that you guys are bearing it so nobly. And can you move these?"
"RORY: Can? No."
"LORELAI: Would if we could? Debatable."
"[Luke moves the backpacks out of the way]"
"LORELAI: Look at that."
"RORY: Spry and accommodating."
"LORELAI: Hey, would you grow a mustache and follow us around Europe?"
"LUKE: Sorry, got travel plans of my own."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Yup, I'm closing down the diner for a couple of weeks and taking Nicole on a little trip."
"RORY: Fun."
"LUKE: We're driving through Western Canada and then taking a cruise up to Alaska."
"RORY: A cruise?"
"LORELAI: Intimate."
"LUKE: I guess. Is it?"
"LORELAI: [sings] The Love Boat."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: A cruise is a good spot to get down on one knee."
"LUKE: And do my ventriloquist act?"
"LORELAI: And propose."
"LUKE: I have no plans to propose."
"LORELAI: You don't now, but after you've had dinner at Captain Stubing's table and Isaac's served you up a couple of mojitos."
"RORY: Romantic cruises say commitment, my friend."
"LUKE: I am not committing and I am not proposing, so drop it."
"LORELAI: Okay, it's dropped."
"LUKE: Really drop it."
"LORELAI: Did I not just say it's dropped?"
"RORY: Heard it with my own ears."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: [sings] The Love Boat."
"[Luke gives her a look]"
"LORELAI: If you'd get a radio in here, I wouldn't have to do that."
"LUKE: Okay, so your graduation is Wednesday at four, correct?"
"RORY: You know, you really don't have to go to it, Luke."
"LUKE: I want to. I feel like I've been through this whole Chilton thing with you."
"RORY: Okay, good, I want you there."
"LUKE: Good. So what do you want?"
"LORELAI: Are you hungry?"
"RORY: I'm just sore."
"LORELAI: Let's go home and rest."
"[they get up and start to leave]"
"LUKE: Hey, wait, don't leave these."
"RORY: Store 'em for us."
"LORELAI: Yeah, until we hire a flatbed truck to carry 'em home for us."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Ugh, my left foot hurts. My right foot hurts. Carry me."
"RORY: You carry me."
"LORELAI: You carry me."
"RORY: No, you carry me."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are standing in the front yard]"
"SOOKIE: What is taking him so long?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Luke, come on!"
"[Luke walks out of the inn]"
"LUKE: Oh, geez, I walked right into a cobweb."
"LORELAI: Aw, aw. So, uh, what's the shape of the place?"
"LUKE: It was a really big cobweb."
"SOOKIE: Terrible. So what's the story?"
"LUKE: Is there a spider on me?"
"LORELAI: Suck it up, big guy, and tell us the scoop."
"LUKE: It's not so bad."
"SOOKIE: So it's not so good."
"LORELAI: Not so bad is not so good."
"LUKE: No, really, it's not bad. The floors -"
"SOOKIE: Are rotted!"
"LORELAI: I knew it. They need to be replaced."
"SOOKIE: It's a disaster."
"LUKE: The floors are fine. They need refinishing, but they're really nice quartersawn oak floors."
"LORELAI: What about the roof?"
"LUKE: The roof -"
"LORELAI: Is sh*t?"
"SOOKIE: It's caving in."
"LORELAI: The walls, too?"
"SOOKIE: Along with our hopes and dreams."
"LUKE: No, the roof is fine. Some shingles need replacing, but that looks like the extent of it."
"[Kirk leans out of an upper-story window]"
"KIRK: Almost done here, folks."
"LORELAI: Great, Kirk. You find any mold?"
"KIRK: You mean, did I find any silent death? Not so far, no."
"LORELAI: Good."
"KIRK: I did tell you about the dangers of mold, right? And Ed McMahon's dog?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you did."
"KIRK: Suffered memory loss due to mold infestation. Forgot how to sit."
"LORELAI: Yes, it was horrible."
"KIRK: It's a growth industry right now, pardon the pun. Mold is money. I just wish I wasn't so scared of finding it."
"LORELAI: Well, don't look too hard then."
"KIRK: Thanks."
"LORELAI: So, what's the final prognosis, Luke? We're not buying a money pit, are we?"
"LUKE: You're gonna spend money, but it's not a pit. Might be a steal."
"LORELAI: It's a steal!"
"SOOKIE: We are such great businesswomen."
"LUKE: Once you start work, you can probably have this place up and running in four or five months."
"SOOKIE: Which will give the Independence Inn owners plenty of time to find our replacements."
"LORELAI: We could be running our own inn in less than a year."
"[Kirk runs out of the inn]"
"KIRK: Oh, ohhh!"
"LORELAI: What's the matter Kirk? Mold?"
"KIRK: No, mouse!"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Students are in line to record messages for the video yearbook]"
"STUDENT: We all knew that our education at Chilton would be exemplary, but it was the people at Chilton. All my friends - Hi Marcy, love you. Cody and Debbie, love you, too. The faculty, the administrative staff. Even our janitorial staff - Jaime and Joachim. I can't count the number of times you guys made me laugh. . ."
"[cut to Rory and Paris in line]"
"PARIS: Does she need medical attention?"
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Jaime and Joachim aren't even getting a copy of this. She's maroon."
"RORY: It's the end of the year, people get nostalgic."
"PARIS: So, how's your valedictorian speech coming along?"
"RORY: Oh, um, it's okay. Pretty standard. Boring. 'We love the school, blah blah blah.' No one listens to those things anyhow, so -"
"PARIS: Relax, I'm okay with you making valedictorian over me."
"RORY: Oh, good, thanks."
"PARIS: Sure. I actually googled the personal histories of Ivy League valedictorians going back twenty-five years, and found some enlightening statistics. They don't necessarily do too well in later life, did you know that?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Oh, yeah. A lot of business failures, crumbled marriages, suicides, obesity."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: A bunch died in car crashes, several did time, one suffocated when his cat fell asleep on his face."
"RORY: Okay, well, thanks again."
"[Louise and Madeline take their turn in front of the camera]"
"LOUISE: Okay, A/V geek, just pan my body nice and slow."
"A/V GEEK: Why?"
"MADELINE: Yeah, why?"
"LOUISE: Because I'll never look better than I do now."
"PARIS: Come on ladies, we don't have all day. A/V geek, I'm going to need six minutes."
"A/V GEEK: You're only allowed two."
"PARIS: Rolling!"
"A/V GEEK: Rolling."
"PARIS: Fellow Chilton seniors, it's been quite a year. . ."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie and Michel are at the front desk.]"
"MICHEL: I hate this."
"SOOKIE: One guest. In the whole inn, one guy."
"MICHEL: And I pulled towel duty today. It's especially awful handling guest towels when you know exactly which guests the towels belong to. It's his mites on those towels."
"SOOKIE: Don't be gross."
"MICHEL: This is degrading for a man of my capabilities."
"SOOKIE: Well, what about me? I've got no kitchen. I'm a chef. My k*ll are deteriorating. I need to sauté, emulsify, marinate."
"MICHEL: I need more mental stimulation."
"SOOKIE: I need to frickin' fry a dead animal in a k*ll. I'm going nuts."
"MICHEL: I should've been a dancer."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"MICHEL: My mother put me in dance school and I rebelled, I wanted to kick the football. I should not have."
"SOOKIE: I've seen you dance and you jump around like a duck."
"MICHEL: You know, I'm getting mighty sick of you."
"SOOKIE: Not as sick as I am of you."
"MICHEL: You know what, you do his towels. I'm not doing his towels anymore."
"SOOKIE: I'm not doing his stupid towels. I hate that stupid guy with his stupid newspaper. He's stupid."
"[Lorelai walks over]"
"LORELAI: Yo, guys, no bickering in front of the guest."
"SOOKIE: Tell it to Deney Terrio here. I should've been a dancer."
"MICHEL: Lorelai, how long can we keep this up?"
"LORELAI: Keep what up?"
"MICHEL: We have one guest, half the rooms are still closed from the fire, most of the staff is laid off, I am doing mite towels, and the owner's son is walking around with a bunch of men in suits."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, John's here. That can't be good."
"LORELAI: John is here looking things over for the renovation that will reopen all the closed rooms so we can be up and running again. Stop worrying."
"MICHEL: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"[Michel and Sookie walk away. The phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"EMILY: Lorelai, it's your mother."
"LORELAI: Mother, hi."
"EMILY: I'm calling to find out how it's going to work at Rory's graduation. Are we going to be sitting together?"
"LORELAI: Well, hm, hm, hm."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Sorry. Hmm."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, of course we'll be sitting together. We're family."
"EMILY: Well, I knew that. I just wasn't sure if you did."
"LORELAI: Well, we're sitting together."
"EMILY: Good."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"RICHARD: Ask her about the gift, Emily."
"LORELAI: Dad?"
"EMILY: He's on the other line."
"LORELAI: Oh, sure got the quiet thing down there."
"RICHARD: I'm on the upstairs portable, but I'm on my way downstairs. I see your mother now. Hello Emily."
"EMILY: Hello Richard."
"RICHARD: I'm on my way to the couch and am about to sit."
"LORELAI: It's like the thrilling day of radio here."
"EMILY: We wanted to ask you about a gift for Rory."
"RICHARD: It's a big gift, a little extravagant."
"EMILY: But it's a big occasion, so it makes sense."
"RICHARD: We wanna buy her a car."
"LORELAI: Well, I think that's a great idea."
"EMILY: Really?"
"RICHARD: Wonderful."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Rory needs to get back and forth from Yale a lot, and the quicker she can do it, the more I get to see her, so it's really kind of a present for me, too."
"RICHARD: Yes, right."
"EMILY: I suppose so."
"RICHARD: Didn't think of that."
"LORELAI: Just not a gas guzzler. And no Ferrari's or Lamborghini's."
"RICHARD: So nothing Italian?"
"LORELAI: No, it can be Italian, just sensible Italian."
"RICHARD: All right, well, good."
"EMILY: I'm glad we had this settled."
"LORELAI: Good. Well, maybe I'll see you at the graduation, maybe I won't."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: See you there. Bye."
"RICHARD: Goodbye."
"EMILY: Bye."
"[they hang up. A man walks over to the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you and your Armani posse want something to drink, John?"
"JOHN: No, no, Lorelai. We're fine, thanks."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, I've been lying to people about you all day."
"JOHN: About what?"
"LORELAI: Oh, about how it's not a big deal that you're walking around with a concerned look on your face with a group of men with concerned looks on their faces. I think I've been lying to me a little, too."
"JOHN: We have to close off three more rooms."
"LORELAI: Three rooms? That'll leave us with two."
"JOHN: And, uh, the estimate for the repairs to get everything back to the quality we had and up to code. . .it's not pretty."
"LORELAI: No, that's not pretty."
"JOHN: Mom's leaning toward selling."
"LORELAI: Selling."
"JOHN: Nothing's final yet."
"LORELAI: Yeah, nothing's final. I just. . .Rory grew up here. I grew up here."
"JOHN: Yeah, I better get back to my group."
"LORELAI: Right, sure, you go. Hey, be careful not to trip over our guest."
"JOHN: I won't."
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Sookie and Jackson are watching television. There's a knock at the front door.]"
"LORELAI: [calls from outside] Sookie, Jackson, you better not be in bed."
"JACKSON: Are you expecting Lorelai?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: [calls] Come on. The night is young and the champagne's cold."
"SOOKIE: The champagne?"
"[they answer the door]"
"LORELAI: Surprise!"
"SOOKIE: What is this?"
"LORELAI: It's a celebration."
"SOOKIE: For what?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, get some glasses, and Jackson, put some music on. Whatever you want, just make it festive."
"JACKSON: Got it."
"SOOKIE: I don't know what this is, but it's fun."
"JACKSON: Let's see. I've got Creedence Clearwater Revival."
"LORELAI: Good energy, too hillbilly."
"JACKSON: Okay."
"LORELAI: How you coming with those glasses, Sook?"
"SOOKIE: Just wiping off the fancy ones."
"JACKSON: Huey Lewis and the News? It's Sookie's."
"SOOKIE: Hey, we all have our guilty pleasures."
"JACKSON: Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass?"
"LORELAI: Ah, fun, festive, that's perfect! Crank it. Okay, I've got some cold Dom for me and Jackson."
"JACKSON: Happens to be my brand."
"SOOKIE: Oh, I love this song."
"LORELAI: And, uh, for Sookie and little baby, uh, whatever-it-is, we've got the, uh, apple bubbly stuff. And cheers."
"JACKSON/SOOKIE: Cheers!"
"SOOKIE: Well, come on, what are we celebrating?"
"LORELAI: Well, you ready?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"JACKSON: Definitely!"
"LORELAI: The Independence Inn is closing."
"JACKSON: Yay!"
"SOOKIE: Yay! The inn is closing."
"LORELAI: Not closing, closed. We're finished. It's all over. They're boarding the place up as we speak. Who wants more?"
"JACKSON: Well, did they find some gold in the basement or something 'cause I'm missing the celebrating angle."
"LORELAI: You should always celebrate new challenges, and that's what this is."
"SOOKIE: A new challenge."
"LORELAI: Yes. They'll be some severance pay, then nothing."
"SOOKIE: Nothing!"
"LORELAI: Nothing but exciting new challenges. Cheers!"
"SOOKIE: The inn is closed."
"JACKSON: Well, I guess this means that you guys can focus solely on refurbishing the Dragonfly, getting that up and running. That's exciting."
"SOOKIE: Yes, it is."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I agree. But just drink some more. How're you feeling?"
"SOOKIE: A little drunk, and all I'm drinking is apple juice."
"LORELAI: Well, good, 'cause I've got another little piece of news for you. We can't buy the Dragonfly because I can't swing my share of the money because I no longer have a steady income."
"JACKSON: Wow, that is great."
"SOOKIE: I'm sorry, was that an exciting challenge too?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely. Yesterday our lives were boring and predictable. We had jobs, we were gonna start our own business. But now everything is wide open. We can do anything we want because we're not penned in. That's good."
"SOOKIE: Yes, that's good. And thinking of those new challenges is a nice way to distract me from the fact that we don't work together anymore so we're gonna see way less of each other."
"LORELAI: Which will make our limited time together more enjoyable."
"JACKSON: Right. And since I'm your vegetable supplier, I'm losing work, and seeing my wife and close friend way less than before."
"LORELAI: Cheers!"
"CUT TO TOWN MEETING"
"[Taylor is at the podium in front of a bored-looking group of townspeople]"
"TAYLOR: That would convert it into a town bylaw, a minor but nonetheless important change from local ordinance, giving us the leeway to enforce charter amendments five and six and grandfathering in previously proposed statutes with no procedural delay. So all those in favor of going ahead of this, say aye."
"[silence]"
"TAYLOR: All those opposed?"
"[silence]"
"TAYLOR: People, what's going on? People!"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, sorry, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: What is the matter with you?"
"LUKE: I think it might be the first time sixty people lost their train of thought all at the same time."
"BABETTE: Yeah, Taylor, your voice always makes me think of my grocery list. We need croutons."
"MOREY: Got it."
"TAYLOR: Moving on. Now, people, I know it's an unpleasant subject, but the deer population in this town is reaching monstrous proportions."
"GYPSY: Not this again."
"MISS PATTY: He's always going on about the deer."
"LUKE: Leave 'em alone, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: But they're taking over the town. We need to institute partial elimination."
"MOREY: Partial elimination?"
"GYPSY: You wanna k*ll the little romping Bambi's?"
"TAYLOR: People, do I have to detail the problems that these deer cause?"
"LUKE: No, but you will."
"TAYLOR: Lyme disease, auto accidents, plane accidents."
"LUKE: We have flying deer?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, that's scary."
"BABETTE: Yeah. Those ones you can snuff."
"TAYLOR: But the worst problem is the crop loss. Dean, hand me the blow-up please."
"GYPSY: Hey, Dean, he's paying you for all this, right?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"KIRK: Really, how much?"
"TAYLOR: People, this is a randomly chosen but typical landscaped area in the town that was denuded by these ruminant pests."
"GYPSY: Randomly chosen?"
"LUKE: Taylor, that's your backyard."
"MISS PATTY: This is a little self-serving."
"TAYLOR: It might be my yard. Uh. . ."
"BABETTE: Might be? Taylor, no one else has a ""Kiss the Gardener"" sign."
"MOREY: This is a trumped up problem."
"TAYLOR: So none of you are interested in addressing this scourge?"
"KIRK: I have a thought."
"TAYLOR: Go ahead, Kirk."
"KIRK: A controlled hunt."
"BABETTE: g*n?"
"KIRK: Not g*n, wolves."
"LUKE: What?"
"KIRK: You release a pack of wolves, they eat the deer, problem solved. Of course, then you'll have to deal with your wolf problem."
"MISS PATTY: I say that we defer this unsavory topic for another year."
"TAYLOR: Now wait a minute."
"MISS PATTY: All those in favor?"
"EVERYONE: Aye!"
"MISS PATTY: Taylor's opposed. Meeting adjourned."
"[People get up to leave. Rory walks in the back door]"
"RORY: I missed the whole thing?"
"LANE: Yes, and I'm still semi-grounded, so I only have a limited amount of time in the outside world."
"RORY: Well, hurry and show me your prom pictures."
"LANE: [picks up a large bag] These are them."
"RORY: Lane, how many did you take?"
"LANE: Three hundred. I'll leave them with you, they're pretty self explanatory."
"RORY: What's this?"
"LANE: Our chicken piccata."
"RORY: Ah, and this?"
"LANE: Our chicken piccata after one bite."
"RORY: So, don't tell me, two bites?"
"LANE: Yup."
"RORY: Okay, I think I can follow this."
"LANE: Gotta run. Keep 'em in order."
"RORY: I will."
"[Lane leaves. Rory walks over to Dean, who is cleaning up at the front of the room]"
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: Hi."
"RORY: Taylor's paying you to do all this work, isn't he?"
"DEAN: He knows I need money, so he's helping me out with extra stuff to do. He's a good guy."
"RORY: Yeah, he is a good guy. A very good guy. So how are the old wedding plans?"
"DEAN: They're fine."
"RORY: You know, my mom's held about a million weddings at the inn and I've worked on a lot of them, so I'm a fountain of useful tips."
"DEAN: Good."
"RORY: For instance, your photographer, have him take candid photographs along with the other ones, so that way you'll capture a lot of your favorite moments and you won't be stuck with just the stiff, you know, posed shots."
"DEAN: Candid, okay."
"RORY: And if the ring bearer is younger than five years-old."
"DEAN: My nephew, he's three."
"RORY: Don't give him the ring until the last second because I have seen many a ring swallowed, and well, it takes a couple days to get it back."
"DEAN: Good point. It's actually been kind of overwhelming. I mean, you have to rent the hall like a year in advance."
"RORY: And make sure that your deposit is refundable as long as you can."
"DEAN: Yeah, it is. And then there's a lot of stuff that we have to buy, too, for our place."
"RORY: Oh yeah, about that. Come on, sit."
"[they sit down and Rory hands him a shopping catalog]"
"DEAN: What's this?"
"RORY: Your wedding gift."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: You can get anything you want, but I've marked a bunch of pages with stuff that I think would be most appropriate, and I just wanted to get in early so I'd be the first one to get you a blender, not the third one."
"DEAN: You don't have to do this."
"RORY: I know. That's why it's fun."
"DEAN: This has everything."
"RORY: I'd recommend the mixing bowls, those are really nice. Or a knife set and a sharpener. Sharpening's very important. I learned that from Sookie. If you leave 'em too long, it's too late. Respect your knives."
"DEAN: Thanks, Rory."
"RORY: You're welcome. So just look through it with Lindsay and pick out what you want and I'll order it."
"DEAN: I will."
"RORY: Bye, Dean."
"DEAN: Bye, Rory."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM"
"[Rory is trying on her graduation dress for Sookie and Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: Maybe we should bring it in a bit more."
"RORY: Oh sure, but first we'll have to use a medieval torture instrument to crush my ribs and flatten my spinal cord in order to accommodate your sadistic wish there."
"LORELAI: Don't use subtlety on us. We're slow."
"SOOKIE: I think she's saying that we don't need to bring it in anymore."
"LORELAI: Take it off, you're done."
"SOOKIE: Ugh, I should go. I've got a stupid job interview tomorrow morning, and you know what, I'm nervous."
"LORELAI: Which place?"
"SOOKIE: Harrington's in Woodbridge."
"LORELAI: Nice."
"SOOKIE: They want me to be their executive chef four nights a week. God, I can't imagine working someplace else. And without my Lorelai!"
"RORY: But it's only a few months until the Dragonfly opens, right?"
"SOOKIE: Uh. . .you haven't told her yet."
"RORY: Told me what?"
"LORELAI: I was waiting for an opportunity."
"RORY: To tell me what?"
"LORELAI: Which apparently is right now. Okay, um, hon, listen. We, um. . .we're not buying the Dragonfly."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: It's just not the right time."
"RORY: You're crazy. It's the perfect time."
"LORELAI: Not really."
"RORY: But if you wait, someone else is gonna buy it. You said so yourself."
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna go, guys. Sorry to spill the beans."
"LORELAI: That's okay. I'll see you later."
"[Sookie leaves]"
"RORY: Mom, why put it off? I mean, I know the Independence Inn closing is a setback."
"LORELAI: Big one."
"RORY: But we've got the rest of Grandpa's money, that's plenty to buy the Dragonfly Inn, and we'll just scrimp on everything until it's all up and running and successful."
"LORELAI: It would take a lot of scrimping."
"RORY: Well, I'm a master scrimper. I would make the Olympic scrimping team. I'm that good, boy."
"LORELAI: Honey, we didn't get financial aid for Yale."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: No scholarships, no hardship money, no money-off coupons, no gift certificates, nothing."
"RORY: I don't understand, what happened?"
"LORELAI: Well, irony of ironies, the money I got from your grandpa took us out of the running for financial aid 'cause it made it look like we have money."
"RORY: Well, send them proof - a bank statement, a letter from Grandpa. Here, take a picture of this couch - no one will think we have money after looking at this couch."
"LORELAI: I tried everything, I swear."
"RORY: Why didn't you tell me this?"
"LORELAI: With everything that's going on, finals and all your personal stuff, I didn't want you worrying."
"RORY: But Grandpa's money -"
"LORELAI: Is paying for Yale."
"RORY: No! No way!"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I'll take a student loan out from the bank. That's what banks are for."
"LORELAI: Honey, I don't want you to be buried by loans the day you graduate from college."
"RORY: Well, then I'll major in something that'll immediately make me a lot of money when I graduate. I'll major in business or engineering."
"LORELAI: You are not changing your major from journalism because of my lack of money."
"RORY: It's our lack."
"LORELAI: Look, if you need to work as a low-paid intern for a magazine or a stringer for some small-town newspaper or Tom Brokaw's toupee comber-outer before you make real money, then that's what you'll do."
"RORY: There has to be another way."
"LORELAI: I've looked. There's nothing."
"RORY: This is so not fair to you."
"LORELAI: I'll have my own inn one day, I promise. But Yale comes first."
"[Rory starts walking to her bedroom]"
"LORELAI: What are you gonna do now?"
"RORY: Rail at God for awhile."
"LORELAI: Tell her I said hi."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is in the living room, which is cluttered with clothes and other stuff to pack for their trip]"
"LORELAI: Hey, what happened to our packing elves who were gonna pack our packs over night?"
"[Rory walks into the room holding a black sweater]"
"RORY: How about this?"
"LORELAI: You hate the dress I made you that much?"
"RORY: Not for graduation, for Europe."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's perfect. It's black so it won't show dirt or wrinkles, and if you wear it with a moody look on your face like you're thinking of Bolsheviks, they'll mistake you for Simone de Beauvoir. Pack it."
"RORY: It's too heavy."
"LORELAI: So, was that a trick question?"
"RORY: We both need to cut weight from our packs."
"LORELAI: I am doing my part here."
"RORY: Well, you don't need five pairs of boots."
"LORELAI: I'll drop some boots if you drop some books."
"RORY: I can't drop books."
"LORELAI: You can't bring twelve books."
"RORY: You also need to cut your undergarments. Don't forget, we'll rinse in Woolite every few days."
"LORELAI: This is going to an uncomfortable place."
"RORY: And your toothpaste - you have three full tubes."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: Why three?"
"LORELAI: If I lose one, I'll have another to take its place."
"RORY: If you're bringing three tubes of toothpaste, I am bringing twelve books plus a dictionary."
"LORELAI: Then I'm bringing a gallon of mercury which is one of the densest and heaviest substances known to man."
"RORY: I think the writing's on the wall here."
"LORELAI: Cancel Europe."
"RORY: I've gotta run. I love my graduation dress."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: Hey, it's a shame about Europe being canceled, huh?"
"LORELAI: That's okay. It's not supposed to be that great anyway, except for the cheese."
"RORY: Nine books for two toothpastes."
"LORELAI: Deal."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings. Emily and Richard walk toward the door]"
"RICHARD: Who is it, Emily?"
"EMILY: I don't know, Richard. My x-ray vision isn't working at the moment."
"RICHARD: I was wondering if you were expecting somebody."
"EMILY: I wasn't expecting anybody."
"[They open the door. Rory is on the porch]"
"EMILY: Rory."
"RORY: Hey Grandma, hey Grandpa."
"RICHARD: What brings you here on this busy day?"
"RORY: I have sort of a time-sensitive issue I need to talk to you about."
"RICHARD: Time sensitive. Well, come in, come in."
"[they walk to the living room]"
"EMILY: We were just getting ready for your ceremony."
"RICHARD: And I was just retying my tie for the third time. No matter how many times I tie a tie, there's always room for error."
"RORY: It's not an exact science, is it?"
"RICHARD: Nor an art form. It's pretty much nothing."
"RORY: Sit down, please."
"RICHARD: Okay."
"EMILY: All right. Should we be nervous?"
"RORY: No, you shouldn't be. I am a little."
"RICHARD: Well, what is it?"
"RORY: I need money."
"RICHARD: You need money."
"RORY: For Yale."
"RICHARD: You need money for Yale."
"EMILY: Stop repeating everything she says."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, I'm processing."
"RORY: Look, it's a long story, but no other financing came through and all of the other options that Mom and I have are just. . .well, not good enough. So here's the offer - I would like for you to loan me the money for four years at Yale, and in return I will get a part time job and pay you in installments. I will continue this payment schedule after graduation increasing the payment amounts in proportion to my income. Plus, I will reinstate Friday night dinners with me. Every Friday night, I will be here, seven o'clock on the dot."
"EMILY: Well, how wonderful."
"RICHARD: We've missed you, Rory."
"RORY: I've missed you, too. So this should work out for everyone, right?"
"EMILY: Absolutely. We're happy to do it."
"RICHARD: Not so fast."
"EMILY: Richard."
"RICHARD: Oh, I'm happy to pay for Yale, but I don't want it to be a loan."
"RORY: No, I don't want that. I want it to be a loan, because otherwise it's too easy."
"RICHARD: Well, then here's my counteroffer. Let's make it a loan, but I insist that you not start paying it back until at least five years after you graduate. Seven years if you go for your Master's."
"RORY: That sounds fair, but I should pay interest."
"RICHARD: No."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"RICHARD: You are not going to pay me interest on this money, no way. That's a deal breaker."
"RORY: Okay."
"RICHARD: Good."
"EMILY: Wonderful."
"RICHARD: We have a deal. Listen, if journalism doesn't work out, you might consider working for me after you graduate. You've got good deal-making k*ll. Eye of the tiger."
"RORY: I'll keep that in mind. Well, I should go."
"EMILY: Rory, does your mother know you're here?"
"RORY: No. This is my thing. I'll see you at the ceremony."
"CUT TO CHILTON COURTYARD"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk to the seating area]"
"SOOKIE: Where do you wanna sit?"
"LORELAI: Is there no special designated area for family and friends of the valedictorian?"
"SOOKIE: Like a skybox or a velvet rope on one of the rows."
"LORELAI: We're the Chilton equivalent of 50 Cent's posse. Where are the boys?"
"SOOKIE: Over there. [points to Luke and Jackson standing by the building]"
"LORELAI: They're doing that thing guys do around fancy buildings."
"SOOKIE: Talk about their construction."
"LORELAI: The insurance costs."
"SOOKIE: Hey guys, get over here."
"LORELAI: Here's a row. Let me see, how many seats do we need? Uh, you, me, Luke, Jackson."
"SOOKIE: That's four."
"LORELAI: Plus Picklepuss and Sauerkraut."
"SOOKIE: Your parents make six."
"JACKSON: These stones have to be carved by hand."
"LUKE: Without the tools we have now. No electricity."
"JACKSON: Just pulleys and fulcrums."
"SOOKIE: Hey, Bob Vila, take a seat."
"LORELAI: Okay, we have to vow not to make fun of any of the kids because inevitably their family will be sitting right behind us just like at the play."
"SOOKIE: Right. Ugh, the big-eared Romeo fiasco of '98. Gotcha."
"[Lorelai's pager goes off]"
"SOOKIE: Who's paging you?"
"LORELAI: Uh, maybe there's a special surprise party for the valedictorian's mom backstage before the ceremony."
"SOOKIE: I bet there is."
"LORELAI: I'll be right back. Wow, look at the gargoyles."
"LUKE: What? Wow, yeah."
"JACKSON: Oh, now those have to be imported from Europe."
"LUKE: The insurance on this place must be astronomical."
"CUT TO INSIDE CHILTON"
"[In the crowded cafeteria, Paris walks over to her Nanny and three young children]"
"PARIS: Nanny, you brought the kids! Você trouxe as crianças."
"KIDS: Paris!"
"PARIS: Ah, minha queride Elzira, Catarina. E olindo Enrique, Antonio Banderas."
"[Lorelai walks up to a student]"
"LORELAI: Oh, excuse me. Hi, I'm looking for Rory Gilmore. She's the valedictorian. I'm her mom."
"[Rory walks over]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Uh, no, wait, go away. I wanna tell a bunch of other people that I'm the valedictorian's mom and I'm looking for you."
"RORY: I've got good news I wanna tell you real quick. Come here."
"[they walk into the hallway]"
"RORY: Okay, you ready?"
"LORELAI: I hope so, ready for what?"
"RORY: You're getting your inn."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Go put in the bid on the Dragonfly. You've got the money now, Grandpa's money."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? How do I have money?"
"RORY: Grandma and Grandpa are paying for Yale."
"LORELAI: Now wait a minute."
"RORY: I explained the situation, they totally understand, and they're loaning me the money for Yale."
"LORELAI: When did they approach you about this?"
"RORY: They didn't. I approached them."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: I just left them now. It's a done deal, so go make the call, put in the bid, before someone else does."
"LORELAI: Rory, honey, do you understand, the Gilmores do nothing altruistically. Strings are attached to everything."
"RORY: There are no strings."
"LORELAI: No strings?"
"RORY: No. I just have to pay them back starting five years after I graduate, and I have to start going back for Friday night dinners."
"LORELAI: Um, hello, Pinocchio, those are strings."
"RORY: But it was my idea to resume the dinners, and I obligated just me. You are in no way apart of it."
"LORELAI: This can't happen, Rory."
"RORY: I don't want you to defer your dream."
"LORELAI: You shouldn't have done this behind my back."
"RORY: Mom, Yale is my thing. I needed financing, I got it."
"LORELAI: Oh, those people, those master manipulators."
"RORY: Mom, this was my idea. I'm manipulating you."
"LORELAI: They are manipulating you to manipulate me."
"RORY: How are they doing that?"
"LORELAI: Rory, don't you see? If you go to Friday night dinners, Mom knows I'll go to just to be with you."
"RORY: She wasn't thinking that."
"LORELAI: They're getting exactly what they want."
"RORY: Don't you see? We're all getting exactly what we want. It's a win-win-win situation."
"LORELAI: It's not."
"RORY: It is."
"LORELAI: Okay, maybe, maybe it is. But just once, just once, I want you to get exactly what you want, and me to get exactly what I want, and them to get nothing."
"RORY: Well, we'll see if we can't arrange that sometime. But the ceremony's about to start, I better get back out there. And go buy that inn!"
"CUT TO CHILTON COURTYARD"
"[Lorelai walks outside and finds Emily and Richard sitting by themselves]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"EMILY: Hello."
"RICHARD: Oh, hi."
"LORELAI: Uh, didn't you see Sookie? We've got seats all saved."
"EMILY: Yes, but we didn't know if the whole seating issue had been resolved."
"LORELAI: Well, it was. Come on."
"RICHARD: Well, I don't remember it being fully resolved either."
"LORELAI: Well, it was. Come on."
"EMILY: We didn't know if you'd changed your mind."
"LORELAI: Well, I didn't. Come on."
"RICHARD: It wasn't crystal clear."
"LORELAI: Fine, just stay there."
"EMILY: You're not serious."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"[They walk over to the saved seats]"
"LORELAI: Uh, Mom, Dad, you've met everyone here. Sookie, Jackson, Luke."
"RICHARD: Hello."
"JACKSON: Hi."
"SOOKIE: Hi."
"LUKE: How ya doing?"
"RICHARD: No, uh. . .no Christopher?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no, he's out of town, but he's having us tons of pictures and order him the official video and we may even come back and reenact the whole thing when he gets home. Now sit, relax."
"[they sit down]"
"LORELAI: [quietly to Sookie] Sookie, long story short, and a partially painful story at that, and hang onto your hat, but we can now put a bid in on the Dragonfly."
"SOOKIE: What? Are you kidding?"
"LORELAI: No."
"SOOKIE: How? What happened?"
"LORELAI: I can't go into it now."
"SOOKIE: Okay, I've gotta tell you, even with the champagne and the Herb Albert, I've been depressed for days. I couldn't watch the Dating Game anymore."
"LORELAI: Well, that's all changed now."
"SOOKIE: I'll go call the attorney. You sit back and relax and enjoy the graduation."
"[Sookie pushes past the people in the row]"
"SOOKIE: This will not happen again, promise."
"[Lorelai notices an empty chair between her and her parents]"
"LORELAI: Uh, you're gonna have to move over one more chair to be part of the group, guys."
"EMILY: Oh, I thought maybe someone else was coming."
"LORELAI: No."
"RICHARD: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: Because if there is, it would be awkward to move during the ceremony."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know what awkward is."
"[Emily and Richard move over; Emily sighs.]"
"LORELAI: What Mom?"
"EMILY: Nothing. That man in front of me is extraordinarily tall, don't you think?"
"CUT TO THE CEREMONY STARTING"
"[The students file out of the school and take their seats. As Rory and Paris sit down, Paris waves to her Nanny and the kids]"
"PARIS: [to Rory] The middle one, Catarina, she bowled a 143 last week."
"RORY: Impressive."
"[Sookie pushes past several people in the row to get back to her chair]"
"SOOKIE: Sorry. I was here before a lot of you, it just looks like I'm late. Appearances can be deceiving. So sorry. [to Lorelai] Real estate agent wasn't in, so I left a message."
"LORELAI: Rats."
"SOOKIE: Did Rory walk in?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, first row. Right in front of the kid with the humongous. . .uh, the really cute kid."
"SOOKIE: Darn, I wanted to get a picture of her walking in. I'll get some of her in her seat."
"[Sookie pushes past the row of people again]"
"SOOKIE: Excuse me. Sorry. I'm not, I'm not like this. Today I am. I'm with the valedictorian, so. . ."
"HEADMASTER: Invited guests, fellow faculty, honored attendees and students, welcome to the Chilton Academy graduating class ceremony of 2003. [applause] This year's class is a distinguished assemblage, equal to or surpassing what has proceeded it. In its 200-year history, Chilton has not failed to produce a class that brings only honor to these grounds and to the academy's fine traditions. To begin, I would like to invite the student body president Paris Gellar to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. Paris?"
"PARIS: [to Rory] As his parting sh*t to me, Charleston never responded to the three aspects of the pledge that I had an objection to and considered rewriting. That's not going to stop me from using air quotes."
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"BRAD: [at podium] Through good times and bad, Chilton formed us, brought us hope, honed our insight, gave us encouragement. Though my time here was briefly interrupted by my period spent on Broadway hanging out with Stephen Sondheim, I still consider Chilton the most rewarding experience of my young life. Now it had always been my plan in closing to recite a short poem I'd written."
"LOUISE: But you reconsidered."
"MADELINE: Come on, Brad. Go out a winner."
"BRAD: But as I read it aloud, I realized the sentiments I wanted to share with my fellow students were better expressed in a favorite song of mine. [sings] Cherish is the word I use to describe. . .bong, bong. Bong, bong."
"RORY: Oh, Brad."
"BRAD: All the feelings that I have hiding here for you inside, bong, bong, bong. You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you. . ."
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"HEADMASTER: It's a distinct pleasure for me to introduce to you our valedictorian. This young lady was a second-year transfer from a modest school where she distinguished herself immeasurably. She is humble, hard working, competitive when need be, and unparalleled in her academic achievements. Ladies and Gentlemen, Rory Gilmore."
"[applause; Rory walks up on stage]"
"SOOKIE: Not crying, right?"
"LORELAI: Not crying. Keeping our cool so we don't miss anything."
"SOOKIE: Tears get in your eyes."
"LORELAI: Then you miss things."
"SOOKIE: So we're not crying."
"LORELAI: Not crying."
"SOOKIE: Not crying."
"JACKSON: Not crying. Not crying."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: No crying."
"LUKE: I'm not crying."
"RORY: Headmaster Charleston, faculty members, fellow students, family and friends, welcome. We never thought this day would come. We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars, counted hours, minutes, and seconds, and now that it's here, I'm sorry it is because it means leaving friends who inspire me and teachers who have been my mentors - so many people who have shaped my life and my fellow students' lives impermeably and forever. I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina, and strolled down Swann's Way. It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything. Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore."
"SOOKIE: Uh oh."
"LORELAI: Hang in there."
"RORY: My mother never gave me any idea that I couldn't do whatever I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be. She filled our house with love and fun and books and music, unflagging in her efforts to give me role models from Jane Austen to Eudora Welty to Patti Smith. As she guided me through these incredible eighteen years, I don't know if she ever realized that the person I most wanted to be was her."
"SOOKIE: Not crying."
"LORELAI: Crying a little."
"SOOKIE: Crying a little, but not blubbering. That's what we meant when we said no crying, no blubbering."
"RORY: Thank you, Mom. You are my guidepost for everything."
"SOOKIE: On the verge of blubbering here."
"JACKSON: Not doing too well myself."
"LORELAI: Not you, too."
"LUKE: I'm blubbering, you're freaks."
"RORY: As we prepare ourselves today to leave. . ."
"CUT TO LATER IN THE CEREMONY"
"[Rory and Paris are in line for their diplomas]"
"ANNOUNCER: Allegra Grace Fass."
"PARIS: I swear, I do not recognize half of these people. [to girl in front of her] Hey. What's your name, what's your story?"
"[cut to the audience]"
"EMILY: Where is she, do you see her?"
"LORELAI: She's the one in the robe."
"EMILY: Lorelai, please."
"LORELAI: She's lost in a sea of blue polyester, Mom. I couldn't point her out if I wanted to."
"JACKSON: Richard, how much to insure all this?"
"RICHARD: Well, the insurance is probably not prohibitive, but the deductibles would be enormous. Well into six figures."
"LUKE: Six figures?"
"JACKSON: That's like having no insurance at all."
"LUKE: So if there was a fire -"
"LORELAI: Guys, please stop assessing the value of the building and pay attention. Rory's coming up."
"RICHARD: Ooh, ooh, sorry."
"SOOKIE: I wanna get a closer sh*t of her getting her diploma."
"[Sookie pushes past several people in the row]"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, sorry, sorry, I suck, I'm sorry."
"ANNOUNCER: Paris Eustace Gellar."
"PARIS: Finally, a name I recognize."

"HEADMASTER: Congratulations, Paris."
"PARIS: No hard feelings."
"HEADMASTER: Okay."

"LORELAI: This is it."
"EMILY: She looks so solemn."
"RICHARD: Like a Gilmore."

"RORY: Thank you, Headmaster."
"ANNOUNCER: Diana Christine Godby."
"[As Rory walks across the stage, she and Lorelai make faces at each other]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, really."
"LORELAI: I taught her everything I know."
"[Sookie returns to her seat]"
"SOOKIE: Honest to God, last time. Sorry. [she sits down and whispers something to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. Uh, uh, I, I need a pen. I don't have a pen. Luke, give me your pen."
"LUKE: I don't have a pen."
"LORELAI: Where's the pen you take orders with?"
"LUKE: You have got to stop assuming that I take pens with me everywhere I go."
"RICHARD: [handing Lorelai a pen] Never be without a pen."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Dad."
"[Lorelai writes ""We got the inn!"" on the graduation program and holds it up to show Rory. They smile and make faces at each other.]"
"EMILY: Really, Lorelai, how many more times are you gonna do that?"
"LORELAI: I think about six."

"HEADMASTER: Class of 2003, give yourself a hand!"

"CUT TO THE COURTYARD"
"[Rory walks over to Lorelai and Luke]"
"RORY: How was my speech?"
"LORELAI: It made everyone cry, including stone cold Luke."
"RORY: Luke, you old softy."
"LUKE: I will never live this down."
"LORELAI: Not with me in your life."
"LUKE: I gotta go, I gotta get back to the diner."
"RORY: Thanks for coming, Luke."
"LUKE: Oh, sure. The building's amazing. So are you."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Rory walks away]"
"LORELAI: It really was great of you to come, Luke. It meant a lot to her."
"LUKE: It was fun."
"LORELAI: So if I don't see you, have fun on your trip with Nicole."
"LUKE: Oh, we may not go now."
"LORELAI: What? You were really looking forward to it."
"LUKE: I don't know if the timing's right and. . .things are kinda weird right now."
"LORELAI: Oh no."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's because I teased you about the commitment thing and proposing. I ruined it."
"LUKE: No, that's not it."
"LORELAI: Please, promise me that's not it. It would break my heart."
"LUKE: But you weren't wrong about that. It got me thinking and it is kind of like committing to her."
"LORELAI: So?"
"LUKE: I don't wanna lead her on."
"LORELAI: But you like her, Luke. You like her a lot, don't you?"
"LUKE: Yeah, she's great."
"LORELAI: Then go. No matter what she's reading into it."
"LUKE: Really? You think that's okay considering. . .I don't know. . .everything?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I do."
"LUKE: Oh, okay. I'll probably go then."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: I guess I was just nervous about nothing."
"LORELAI: That's what I think, too."
"LUKE: I'll see ya in a couple months."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'll see you then."
"[Paris walks up to Rory]"
"PARIS: I guess we should say our goodbyes. Nanny made me a special dinner. She makes a mean farturas."
"RORY: Well, good, I'm glad you found me. I wanted to say goodbye, too."
"PARIS: Good. Well, good luck."
"RORY: You know, it's weird, most of the time I really hated you."
"PARIS: Yeah, I really hated you, too."
"[They hug. Paris walks away. Lorelai, Emily, and Richard walk over]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RICHARD: Well, I think it might be time to present Rory with her graduation gift."
"RORY: Oh, you guys didn't have to get me anything."
"EMILY: Nonsense."
"RICHARD: Uh, this one wouldn't fit in an envelope, so follow me please."
"EMILY: We're really excited about this one."
"LORELAI: So am I."
"EMILY: Good."
"[they walk toward the parking lot]"
"RICHARD: Rory, there is your gift. It's the one with the bow."
"RORY: Um, Grandpa."
"EMILY: Richard."
"[the parking lot is filled with cars with bows on them]"
"RICHARD: Oh, for Pete's sake. Well, it was the only one there when I drove it up."
"EMILY: You should've put a more distinctive bow on it."
"RICHARD: Well, how was I supposed to know that every kid at Chilton was getting a car?"
"RORY: You got me a car?"
"RICHARD: We got you a car."
"RORY: That's amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Which one is it?"
"LORELAI: Or did you get her one for every day of the week like the underwear?"
"RICHARD: We got her one car. It's a little Prius. It's safe, it gets great gas mileage."
"EMILY: And it's the one that Leonardo DiCaprio drives."
"RORY: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you guys."
"EMILY: We love you, too."
"RICHARD: And don't forget to call about -"
"RORY: Insurance. I'll do it the second I get home."
"RICHARD: Good. Congratulations, Rory. And thank you for your speech."
"RORY: You're welcome. I meant it, thank you for everything."
"EMILY: Have fun in Europe. Both of you."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Mom."
"EMILY: When do you get back?"
"LORELAI: The 27th."
"EMILY: Terrific. We'll see you that Friday for dinner."
"[Emily and Richard leave. Lorelai and Rory walk back toward the school building]"
"LORELAI: Explain the win-win-win thing again."
"RORY: Everybody wins, that's what it is."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[Rory's cell phone rings]"
"RORY: Hello? Hello?"
"LORELAI: A hang up?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You're getting a lot of those lately."
"[phone rings again]"
"RORY: Hello? Hello?"
"[Lorelai waits outside as Rory takes the phone into the school]"
"RORY: Jess, is that you? Jess, I'm pretty sure it's you and I'm pretty sure you've been calling and not saying anything but wanna say something. Hello? You're not going to talk? Fine, I'll talk. You didn't handle things right at all. You could've talked to me. You could've told me that you were having trouble in school and weren't going to graduate, and that your dad had been there, but you didn't. And you ended up not taking me to my prom and not coming to my graduation and leaving again without saying goodbye again, and that's fine, I get it, but that's it for me. I'm going to Europe tomorrow and I'm going to Yale and I'm moving on. And I'm not going to pine. I hope you didn't think I was going to pine, okay? I think. . .I think I may have loved you, but I just need to let it go. So, that's it, I guess. Um, I hope you're good. I want you to be good, and, um, okay, so, goodbye. That word sounds really lame and stupid right now, but there it is. Goodbye."
"[Rory hangs up; in California, Jess hangs up a payphone and walks down the street]"
"[Lorelai walks into the school]"
"LORELAI: Hey. You okay?"
"RORY: I'm okay."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: But Sookie and Jackson are out that way."
"LORELAI: I wanna go back a different way, come on."
"RORY: I thought we were going home."
"LORELAI: I just wanna make one more stop before we do."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is cleaning up the tables as Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Lorelai, hi. Where's Rory?"
"LORELAI: Oh, out in the car."
"LUKE: Oh. It was a really nice ceremony, wasn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it was beautiful."
"LUKE: What's up?"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to say something to you in case we don't see each other before you go on your trip."
"LUKE: Sure, what?"
"LORELAI: Don't get engaged."
"LUKE: What, why?"
"[Lorelai turns to leave]"
"LUKE: Lorelai?"
"[Lorelai leaves the diner as Luke stares after her]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke wakes up from his dream]"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Lorelai and Rory rush down a hallway]"
"RORY: Mom, wait."
"LORELAI: Hurry, hurry."
"RORY: This outfit produces a lot of wind resistance."
"[they stop at the bottom of the staircase]"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: What are we doing?"
"LORELAI: Leaving our mark. Got a knife?"
"RORY: A knife? For what?"
"LORELAI: Carving our initials. Come on, knife, knife."
"RORY: Uh, like the switchblade I keep in my sock? No, I left it at home."
"LORELAI: I must have something in here. [looks through her purse] Ah, safety pin, perfect."
"RORY: We can't do this."
"LORELAI: Yes, we can. People need to know we were here."
"RORY: I'm in the yearbook."
"LORELAI: How about the wall?"
"RORY: No, that's too out in the open. They'll trace it back to us."
"LORELAI: They'll see LG and RG and figure out it was us?"
"RORY: They're are no dorks here."
"LORELAI: Somewhere in the floor?"
"RORY: This marble is two hundred years old. Harriet Beecher Stowe walked on this marble."
"LORELAI: Oh, the banister."
"RORY: Was donated by Robert Frost."
"LORELAI: The sconce."
"RORY: Was ceremonially lit for the first time by Thomas Edison."
"LORELAI: Geez, is there anything in this whole room that some famous dead person didn't have something to do with."
"[they hear some people walking by]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, cool it, cool it. And this is some very interesting architectural do-dads and hoo-ha's."
"RORY: And wingdings and tum-tum's."
"LORELAI: That was close."
"RORY: Look, just carve it really tiny here on the baseboard of the wall, and do it reversed, so GL and GR."
"LORELAI: Oh, maybe it's not such a good idea."
"RORY: The madness passes."
"[Sookie opens the door at the top of the staircase]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, you guys coming? Party at your place, right?"
"RORY: Party?"
"LORELAI: Just a little gathering."
"RORY: Cool."
"LORELAI: We'll meet you back at our house."
"SOOKIE: Okay, see you there. [leaves]"
"[Lorelai and Rory start walking up the stairs]"
"LORELAI: Wait, wait. Look around for a second. Notice?"
"RORY: Notice what?"
"LORELAI: It's not so scary anymore."
"RORY: No, it's not."

"OPEN IN LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[An airport shuttle van drops Lorelai and Rory off in front of their house, then pulls away]"
"LORELAI: Agh!"
"RORY: And we're home."
"LORELAI: How long does a freakin' van ride take?"
"RORY: Not that long!"
"LORELAI: Everybody in the world's life flashed before my eyes. That's how much time I had. I thought we were gonna die on that van."
"RORY: It seemed a good possibility."
"LORELAI: Ugh, that van ride felt longer than our train ride from Paris to Prague, and we had that group of French boys singing Sk8er Boi and smelling like a soccer field sitting all around us."
"[Babette comes out of her house and rushes over to them]"
"BABETTE: Oh my God, you're back! Morey, they're back! Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?"
"LORELAI: Oh, we're fine."
"BABETTE: You're fine? They're fine! Morey!"
"MOREY: [opens his front door] Yeah?"
"BABETTE: They're fine!"
"MOREY: Okay. [goes back inside]"
"BABETTE: What the hell happened to you two? According to the itinerary that Rory gave me, you were supposed to be home on Saturday."
"LORELAI: The itinerary that Rory gave you?"
"BABETTE: So when you girls didn't show up, we panicked! Morey?"
"MOREY: [opens front door] Yeah?"
"BABETTE: Didn't we panic?"
"MOREY: Yeah. [goes inside]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Morey, you ever thought about just staying out here at times like these?"
"BABETTE: By Sunday night, I was a complete basketcase. I thought you'd been kidnapped by some crazy Sandinistas or something."
"LORELAI: 'Cause the Sandinista movement is so popular in France."
"BABETTE: So, finally, I just started calling consulates."
"RORY: Consulates?"
"LORELAI: How many consulates?"
"BABETTE: Ah, jeez, all of 'em. Anyhow, you're here. Let's go inside, I wanna hear all about Europe. Morey, I'm going in!"
"MOREY: [calls from his house] Okay."
"[Babette goes into Lorelai's house]"
"LORELAI: You gave her an itinerary?"
"RORY: I thought it would be good for someone to know where we were."
"LORELAI: Oh, you gave her an itinerary and she called every consulate in the world."
"RORY: If we were caught smuggling hash over the border and we were thrown in some Turkish prison, wouldn't you want someone to know that we were in Turkey?"
"LORELAI: Where'd we get this hash we were smuggling?"
"RORY: You were at a café, you met a guy, he was sweet-talking you, he put the stuff in your purse when you weren't looking."
"LORELAI: At least tell me he was cute."
"RORY: He was not bad for a hash dealer."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[they walk into the house]"
"BABETTE: [calls from the kitchen] I'm making cocoa!"
"LORELAI: She's making cocoa 'cause you gave her an itinerary."
"RORY: I may have given her the itinerary, but you're the one who got us busted for drug smuggling."
"LORELAI: Reality has absolutely no place in our world."
"[they walk to the kitchen]"
"BABETTE: Okay, I wanna hear all about Europe. Come on, tell me, what'd you see?"
"LORELAI: Well, everything. Uh, Notre Dame, the Roman Baths, St. Peter's Basilica."
"RORY: Mom touched the Pope."
"BABETTE: You're kidding!"
"LORELAI: Actually, I just touched his car. Then one of the Swiss guards in the fruity cool clothing busted me."
"RORY: Luckily, Mom's fluent in flirting."
"LORELAI: And flirting with a guy in a pompom hat and a skirt is quite an accomplishment."
"BABETTE: Well, it sounds like you had a terrific trip."
"RORY: It was. [Lorelai signals for her to fake a yawn, and Rory does]"
"LORELAI: Aw, are you okay, hon?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm just a little sleepy."
"BABETTE: Aw, of course, you girls must be wiped. I'll, uh, get out of here."
"LORELAI: Oh, but thanks, Babette."
"BABETTE: Well, goodnight, sleep tight. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Morey, I'm coming home! [leaves]"
"RORY: I'm gonna go unpack."
"LORELAI: Oh, unpack tomorrow."
"RORY: No, if I leave stuff packed overnight, everything's gonna get gross."
"LORELAI: Everything's already gross."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"RORY: Ahhh."
"[Rory walks to the closet as Lorelai gets on the bed]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, your bed feels good."
"RORY: Do not get comfortable. I will sleep on top of you if I have to."
"LORELAI: Oh man, smell this. [holds up a pillow]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I forgot that pillows don't have to smell like feet. You know, I have to say, I think it's good I did this hostel thing in my thirties, and I'll tell you why."
"RORY: [hugging the clothes in her closet] I missed you, I missed you all!"
"LORELAI: If I had done it in my twenties or teens, I would've been naïve enough to think that hostels were exotic and romantic. But once you're in your thirties, you've lived enough to know they're gross and should be avoided at all costs."
"RORY: [to her clothes] I had a dream about you in Copenhagen. You were there, and you, and you, and you."
"LORELAI: Listen, since we slept on the plane, we should go to sleep now, but get up really early tomorrow. We don't wanna blow this whole week being jet-lagged. We need to establish normal sleeping patterns."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'm gonna go take a shower and leave you alone to make out with your sock drawer."
"RORY: Close the door."
"[Lorelai leaves. Rory pulls open her sock drawer]"
"RORY: Hello, boys."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is organizing the souvenirs in the living room. Lorelai walks down the steps talking on the phone]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Gilmore, Lorelai, yes. My daughter's name is Lorelai also. Well, very confusing or, in your case, extremely convenient. Uh, no, see, we were never missing, it was a big mistake."
"RORY: Who are you talking to?"
"LORELAI: Belgium."
"RORY: Ah."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Yes, uh huh, Babette Dell. She got our arrival dates mixed up and she was just worried, but we're fine, we're here. We just loved your fries. Okay, sure, bye bye. [hangs up] Okay, Belgium's done, Lisbon's calling me back, Berlin had no idea what I was talking about, and Paris is pissed."
"RORY: At who?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, who knows? Okay, I'm taking a break and then I'm taking on the Netherlands. I still cannot believe Babette did this."
"RORY: She just loves us."
"LORELAI: Well, be a little less lovable, would you, 'cause it's costing me a fortune. Try being one of those kids where people are like, ""Oh really, she was kidnapped? Hey, well, thin the herd."""
"RORY: Very nice. Hey, who are the rosary beads for?"
"LORELAI: They're mine."
"RORY: What do you need rosary beads for?"
"LORELAI: They're cute."
"RORY: They're for prayer."
"LORELAI: Well, pray they match my blue suit?"
"RORY: They have just upgraded you to a queen-size bed, Jacuzzi tub, junior suite in hell."
"LORELAI: Hm. Oh, Pieta placemat?"
"RORY: Oh, Gypsy."
"LORELAI: How are you feeling?"
"RORY: You know, not bad. Just a little spacy."
"LORELAI: Like a cold medicine buzz?"
"RORY: Maybe we got lucky and missed the jet lag."
"LORELAI: I hope so because we have a very big week ahead of us."
"RORY: Oh yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yes. In fact, I have here in my hand a schedule of all the activities we are going to partake in over this week, the final week of Rory Gilmore's life before she enters the ivy-covered hallowed halls of Yale University."
"RORY: Schedule, please."
"LORELAI: Okay. Today we get these presents out to our friends and then we hit the mall."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow we get an early start and we hit three of the crappier movies that are out."
"RORY: And then we have dinner at Grandma's."
"LORELAI: Which I will conveniently not put down on my list in the hopes that that magically goes away. Uh, okay, the next day we hit New York, see your fancy art galleries, hit the Strand."
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Pizza at John's. Um, Sunday, pick up all the stuff you need for school, and then there's a barbecue at Sookie's. Monday is mani/pedi, facial, haircut, go to the psychic, and stock up for Tuesday, the day of all days - Godfather I, II, and III, with extra showings of the Sofia death scene over and over as long as the Mallomars hold out."
"RORY: The perfect day!"
"LORELAI: I agree."
"RORY: And I think we have just enough of the biscotti that we brought back from Milan to last us the rest of the week."
"LORELAI: Oh, good. Well, everything's in order, so, uh, let's get going and get this stuff out of here."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Wow, we sure have a lot of gifts. Do we like this many people?"
"RORY: I didn't think so. Maybe we're getting soft in our old age."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I guess we should get some tote bags."
"RORY: What tote bags?"
"LORELAI: We must have tote bags."
"RORY: Where would we get tote bags?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me, every woman who's ever purchased seventy-five dollars worth of Clinique products has some tote bags."
"RORY: We don't have tote bags."
"LORELAI: Well, how are we supposed to get this stuff out of here?"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street wearing their backpacks]"
"LORELAI: Now we're the quirky backpack ladies."
"RORY: One of the kinder nicknames that have been attributed to us."
"LORELAI: Let's just be very efficient about this. Okay, we'll start with Patty, work our way clockwise around the town, end with Andrew. And let's stick with the 'my mom touched the Pope' anecdote. It's quick, it's peppy, and everybody likes a nice Pope story."
"RORY: Do we have time to stop at Luke's? I'm starving."
"LORELAI: Absolutely. This is our week, this week we do anything we want."
"RORY: I like this week."
"LORELAI: Hey, I wonder if Luke and Nicole actually went on that cruise."
"RORY: I thought he was going."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but I wonder if he actually went."
"RORY: Why wouldn't he?"
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know. Because he'd have to pack and leave, plus he'd have to buy a bathing suit."
"RORY: Well, I hope he went. He could use a good vacation. Plus, he really seems to like Nicole."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm. Yeah, he does. Oh, hey, looks like the soda shop is open."
"RORY: Oh, cool."
"[They stop outside the soda shop and see Luke and Taylor arguing inside]"
"LUKE: I am gonna k*ll you."
"TAYLOR: Oh, please, you are not."
"LUKE: I am, too. I'm gonna k*ll you. I should've k*ll you before. I should've k*ll you the minute you put up those unicorn topiaries in the park, but, hey, hindsight, right?"
"RORY: Aw, I've missed that."
"LORELAI: What do you think, biscotti moment?"
"RORY: Absolutely."
"[Lorelai and Rory eat biscotti while they watch Luke and Taylor argue]"
"TAYLOR: You don't have to yell, Luke."
"LUKE: You put a giant window in my wall."
"TAYLOR: So what?"
"LUKE: A giant window! Right here! You can see my entire diner. And when I'm in my diner, I can see your whole stupid store."
"TAYLOR: I don't understand why yours is a diner and mine is a stupid store."
"LUKE: Look at this place! Look at you. All you need is six dancing penguins and Mary Poppins floating in the corner to bring back two of the worst hours of my childhood."
"TAYLOR: I don't think you had a childhood. I think you came out a bitter surly k*ll."
"LUKE: You can't change the basic structure of this place without my okay! What?"
"TAYLOR: Your hand is near the wax lips."
"LUKE: So?"
"TAYLOR: If you could just move it so you don't accidentally touch the candy. Lucas. [Luke rummages through the different boxes of candy] What are you doing? You stop that right now!"
"LUKE: [throws candy in the air] Look at all the pretty candy!"
"TAYLOR: Agh, stop it right now!"
"LORELAI: [gasps] Oh my God!"
"RORY: Hm, what? What's the matter?"
"LORELAI: Luke."
"RORY: Yeah, he's finally lost it."
"LORELAI: No, we forgot Luke."
"RORY: We forgot Luke what? Oh, we forgot to bring him back a gift. Oh no!"
"LORELAI: We kept putting it off and putting it off."
"RORY: We couldn't find anything good enough."
"LORELAI: We should've gotten him that bullfighter's uniform."
"RORY: Well, so what do we do?"
"LORELAI: Well, we have to just pick up something here and we'll tell him that we got it in Denmark."
"RORY: Pick up what?"
"LORELAI: Something."
"RORY: What? This is Stars Hollow. Everything you buy here has a Hello, Kitty stamped on the bottom."
"LORELAI: Well, we have to get him something. We cannot go into Luke's empty handed."
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: I'm hungry."
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the house]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Sookie!"
"[Sookie rushes off the porch to greet them]"
"SOOKIE: [squeals] You're back!"
"LORELAI: We're back!"
"[they all hug; Jackson comes out of the house]"
"JACKSON: Hey, don't squish baby!"
"SOOKIE: I missed you so much!"
"LORELAI: We missed you so much."
"SOOKIE: Ah, look at you! You look older."
"RORY: Oh, thanks, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: So how was it, was it wonderful?"
"LORELAI: Oh -"
"SOOKIE: I wanna hear everything you did and everything you ate. Oh, was it warm? I read it was warm. How was Barcelona? Did you see the gaudy apartments? Ooh, did you see a bullfight? Did you see Anne Frank's house? Did you cry? Was Steven Speilberg there, huh? Oh, hey, I hear you touched the Pope! Are you hungry? Do you want anything to eat? I've got quiche."
"[they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Hold on one sec here, missy. I need to look at you. Sideways, please."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Hello, hi, nice to see you. I'm your Auntie Lorelai, and this is your Auntie Rory. Say hi, Rory."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Come over here."
"RORY: Oh, no, I'm good."
"SOOKIE: Come on, Rory, rub my stomach."
"RORY: I'd rather not."
"LORELAI: Rory's a chicken."
"SOOKIE: So is Jackson."
"JACKSON: Hey, I'm gonna like it when it comes out."
"LORELAI: So what did the ultrasound say, boy or girl?"
"SOOKIE: It's a -"
"JACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh."
"LORELAI: It's a buh? What's a buh?"
"JACKSON: [reveals a button pinned to his shirt] Read."
"LORELAI: [reads button] ""I do not want to know the sex of my baby."""
"JACKSON: That's right. I'm going old school on this."
"SOOKIE: And he's being completely stubborn."
"RORY: But you know?"
"SOOKIE: Of course I know. I had little clothes to buy -"
"JACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!"
"SOOKIE: What? I said nothing about the sex."
"JACKSON: You said little, and now I know it's going to be little."
"LORELAI: Jackson, seriously, you don't wanna know?"
"JACKSON: Hey, in the old days, the guys would pace back and forth in the waiting room until a pretty nurse in a nice white outfit would come out and say, ""Congratulations - it's a 'insert your chosen sex here'."" Ricky Ricardo didn't know, Dick van d*ke didn't know, and by gum, if it was good enough for Rick and Dick, it's good enough for me."
"LORELAI: Well, I wanna know."
"JACKSON: Rory, what do you say? Be on my side."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, there are no sides."
"JACKSON: We can be in that waiting room together, pacing, waiting, we'll get you a nice suit. What do you say?"
"RORY: Okay, sure. I'm on Jackson's side."
"JACKSON: Great. Welcome to 1954. [gives her a button]"
"RORY: Happy to be here."
"LORELAI: Well, I wanna know."
"SOOKIE: Come on, I'll tell you outside."
"LORELAI: Sure you don't wanna go?"
"RORY: Read the button, missy."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Lorelai and Sookie leave]"
"RORY: So, you hear about that whole Sputnik thing?"
"JACKSON: Oh, Eisenhower's on top of it."
"RORY: Hm."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk out back to the shed]"
"LORELAI: So Jackson's really not gonna be in the delivery room with you?"
"SOOKIE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Does that bug you?"
"SOOKIE: Hey, I don't like Jackson to see me shave my legs, so. . .I'm opening the shed! Okay, are you ready?"
"LORELAI: For what?"
"[Sookie opens the shed; it's filled with blue baby products]"
"LORELAI: [gasps] It's a boy!"
"SOOKIE: It's a boy!"
"LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, you're having a boy!"
"SOOKIE: I know! Jackson will finally have that son to prune the trees with."
"LORELAI: My God, it's so exciting. A boy! Oh, a little boy. I know nothing about little boys."
"SOOKIE: Me neither."
"LORELAI: Man, you're prepared, aren't you?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, I am."
"[They sit down in chairs in the shed]"
"LORELAI: It's so nice to be home."
"SOOKIE: It's nice to have you home."
"LORELAI: Hey, have you seen Luke lately?"
"SOOKIE: Briefly."
"LORELAI: I guess he went on that cruise, huh?"
"SOOKIE: Yup."
"LORELAI: That's good. That's good he went. He needed a vacation. He works hard, that one. Always cooking, making the coffee, taking the orders."
"SOOKIE: You know, I think something happened on that trip of his."
"LORELAI: What do you mean?"
"SOOKIE: Well, the day he got back, Jackson and I went into the diner and I asked him how his trip went. He couldn't get away from me fast enough."
"LORELAI: Really? Was Jackson wearing that creepy button?"
"SOOKIE: Nope. Luke just seemed kind of freaked out about something."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You think he and Nicole had a fight or something?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: He didn't say anything?"
"SOOKIE: Nope. He just walked around acting weirder than normal."
"LORELAI: Huh. Wonder what that's all about. So. . . are you gonna name him Lorelai?"
"SOOKIE: Absolutely. That wouldn't be confusing at all."
"LORELAI: Great."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street. Lorelai is carrying a jar of jam.]"
"RORY: I cannot believe you."
"LORELAI: What? It's the perfect gift for Luke. Fine fancy jam from France."
"RORY: Fine fancy jam from Jackson's pantry."
"LORELAI: I don't know what you're talking about. I am looking right here at this beautiful hand-crafted label and it says ""Fruits de la Terre."""
"RORY: You didn't even spellcheck to make sure you got the French right."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I think it adds an authentic touch. See, in my world, the person who made this jam was an illiterate orphan. . .Sochelle."
"RORY: As in Sochelle Crab."
"LORELAI: Yes, exactly. Sochelle was born by the sea, or so said the note left in the bassinet when the nuns found her on the steps of Notre Dame."
"RORY: Oh, good, there are nuns."
"LORELAI: Every sad story needs nuns. Anyhow, Sochelle had nothing - no father, no mother, no friends, no education. All she had was a burning desire to make great jam, and now she's the most successful jamstress in Paris."
"RORY: Luke's gonna know."
"LORELAI: No, he is not."
"RORY: Well, as much as I would like to be there when you give Luke your heartfelt gift, I'm gonna go give Lane her gift."
"LORELAI: All right, but if you're not there, I'm gonna get all the credit for this."
"RORY: Exactly as it should be."
"LORELAI: Give Lane a hug for me."
"RORY: I will. Don't give him the jam."
"LORELAI: I can't hear you, I'm too far away."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Bonjour, Luke. Pouvez-vous attacher vos chausseurs?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Uh, hi, Luke. Do you know how to tie your shoes?"
"LUKE: Very good."
"LORELAI: Yup. It came in handy, let me tell you. Not one shoelace fatality on my watch. [he sets a mug in front of her] You remembered."
"LUKE: Yup. A couple things about you stick. You have a good time?"
"LORELAI: Vos odeurs de chat."
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: Your cat smells."
"LUKE: You must've been a big hit with the salon set."
"LORELAI: The trip was incredible, we had the best time. We were supposed to come back on Saturday."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: Keeping tabs on me?"
"LUKE: Always safer to know which direction the tornado's coming from."
"LORELAI: Anyhow, we were in London and we ran into this group of girls who were heading to Ireland to stake out the Clarence Hotel."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because U2 owns it and Bono hangs out there."
"LUKE: Ah. Him again."
"LORELAI: So then we jumped on a train and we headed to Ireland - incredibly beautiful, by the way - and we sat in a bar for two days and did nothing but eat soda crackers and funky cheese and he never showed."
"LUKE: Que sera."
"LORELAI: Hm. [sips her coffee] Mm, still good. I told 'em about you over there, Señor Swanky-pants."
"LUKE: Can't tell you how grateful I am to have you as my press agent."
"LORELAI: And we got you something."
"LUKE: You did?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we did."
"LUKE: You didn't have to do that."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? We do not go to Europe and come back without bringing something for Luke. Here. [hands Luke the jar of jam]"
"LUKE: Jam."
"LORELAI: Yes, fancy French jam."
"LUKE: Fruits de la Terre. Very impressive."
"LORELAI: It's handmade by this woman in Paris who has the most amazing story."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Orphaned."
"LUKE: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: And illiterate."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Just had nothing in her life, you know, except this burning desire to be the world's greatest jamstress. And she's famous now and, uh, you know, she only makes three bottles of that stuff a year and that's one of 'em, and I brought it all the way across the, uh. . .I got it from Sookie's house."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: How did you know?"
"LUKE: Just a wild guess."
"LORELAI: I swear, we tried to get you something, but nothing was good enough."
"LUKE: No, forget it. I didn't get you anything on my trip either. We're even."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, how was the cruise?"
"LUKE: Oh, it was. . .you know."
"LORELAI: Not really, I've never been on a cruise. So. . ."
"LUKE: It was fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, you and Nicole had fun then?"
"LUKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You want more coffee?"
"LORELAI: Uh, eh, oh. So what did you?"
"LUKE: Where?"
"LORELAI: On the boat? What did you and Nicole do on the boat?"
"LUKE: Oh, uh, you know, we fluttered around and ate, and there was a magic show and a singer and pillow mints, and you know, that's it."
"LORELAI: But you and Nicole had a good time, you got along, and. . ."
"LUKE: Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna go check on your food."
"LORELAI: Okay. [Luke walks away] I didn't order anything yet."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Kirk is hanging up a poster in front of the market as Rory walks by]"
"RORY: Hi, Kirk."
"KIRK: Bienvenido, señora Gilmore."
"[Rory sees that her picture is on the poster, promoting her as the Ice Cream Queen. She tears it down and walks away]"
"KIRK: What are you doing? I just put that there."
"CUT TO TAYLOR'S SODA SHOP"
"[Taylor is instructing the employees on how to serve the ice cream]"
"TAYLOR: Scoop toward you, rolling smoothly. Very good, Ginger. Nice symmetrical balls there, Joshua. Easy on the nuts, easy on the nuts. One cherry, and then present your sundae with a Taylor Tip."
"[Rory walks in carrying the poster]"
"RORY: Uh, excuse me, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Ah, there you are. Hello, your majesty. Come to check on your little kingdom? Uh, Ginger, hand me a spoon."
"RORY: I was just walking by when I -"
"TAYLOR: Here you are, on the house. [hands her a dish of ice cream]"
"RORY: Thank you."
"TAYLOR: Would you like an extra cherry?"
"RORY: No."
"TAYLOR: Because if the Stars Hollow Ice Cream Queen wants two cherries, then she will get two cherries, and to hell with the extra twenty-five cent charge."
"RORY: Taylor, you didn't ask me if I wanted to be the Ice Cream Queen."
"TAYLOR: So?"
"RORY: So, you didn't ask me. You just put my picture on a flier and stuck it up all over town."
"TAYLOR: Well, I couldn't very well ask you when you were traipsing all over Europe, now could I?"
"RORY: But -"
"TAYLOR: And don't worry about getting anything. I have already rented a cape and a crown. Just wear a nice simple sage-colored floor-length dress and you'll be fine."
"RORY: I can't do it."
"TAYLOR: What do you mean, you can't do it?"
"RORY: I mean, I'm busy right now. I only have a couple days left before I go off to school, and my mom and I have every moment planned, so I'm just going to have to pass on this one."
"TAYLOR: Oh, I see. You're going to pass. You're passing on this. Fine. Just consider yourself passed."
"RORY: Look, I can still come by."
"TAYLOR: Oh, can you, really? You can find time in your busy day to come by and eat my free ice cream and take my free balloon and get yourself a free glitter hand stamp? You can swing that? You don't have to pass on that, huh?"
"RORY: Look, Taylor, don't take it like this."
"TAYLOR: In my own defense, I assumed you would be thrilled based on your, uh, past participation record."
"RORY: But this has nothing to do with -"
"TAYLOR: You've always been the head pilgrim girl at the food drive table."
"RORY: Yes, well, that's for charity."
"TAYLOR: The third leprechaun at the St. Patty's Day festival."
"RORY: Yes, okay, but again, for charity."
"TAYLOR: You man the ticket booth on Groundhog Day. You help organize the manger procession at Christmas, you play Esther every year at the Purim carnival. I just assumed you liked taking part in town events."
"RORY: I do like it, but I just can't this time. I'm sorry."
"TAYLOR: Oh, don't be. It's my own fault. I should have figured that once you got into Yale everything would be different."
"RORY: That's not fair."
"TAYLOR: No, I understand. You're no longer our little Stars Hollow Rory Gilmore. You belong to the Ivy Leagues right now. It's time to cut those small town ties and go off and do something important like go to drama school or have one of those high-class naked parties with that Bush girl."
"RORY: Taylor -"
"TAYLOR: Okay. See you around the quad. [walks away]"
""

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door]"
"LORELAI: Okay, that took way longer than it was supposed to. From now on, when we go out of town, no presents for anyone."
"RORY: Oh, right. So we'll just buy everyone a big crate of Fruits de la Terre."
"LORELAI: That horse is dead, put the stick down. Now we're way behind in our schedule, so I propose a change. Let's hold off on the frivolous shopping until tomorrow. What's up?"
"RORY: That Taylor thing is still bugging me."
"LORELAI: Me, too. I can't believe you didn't call me in to see the fight."
"RORY: Maybe I am different. Maybe I do have an attitude."
"LORELAI: I think you do."
"RORY: I mean, I've always had time for the town in the past, and now suddenly I don't? Am I changing? I don't wanna change. I don't wanna be the anti-town girl. I'm not Daria."
"LORELAI: Taylor is just messing with your mind, which is one of his specialties. Ignore him."
"RORY: I guess. [she picks up a pile of mail from the coffee table.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, no mail yet. We agreed, we're still on vacation."
"RORY: Well, I'll just look through my mail. Yours can sit there as long as you like."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but then you're back in the real world again and I'm out here in vacation-land alone. That's not fun."
"RORY: [reading a letter] Oh no."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Oh no."
"LORELAI: What oh no?"
"[Rory heads to her bedroom, Lorelai follows]"
"RORY: Oh no. Oh no. No no no no no no no no no. Oh no."
"LORELAI: Uh, hey, kid, you're kind of freaking me out here."
"[Rory flips through her date book]"
"RORY: I wrote the date down wrong."
"LORELAI: What date?"
"RORY: This is from Yale. My orientation is Saturday."
"LORELAI: Right, next Saturday."
"RORY: No, this Saturday."
"LORELAI: No, next Saturday."
"RORY: No, this Saturday."
"LORELAI: But today's Thursday. That means we have no -"
"RORY: I have to be at school the day after tomorrow."
"LORELAI: But. . .no! We had a free week. I had it all scheduled out."
"RORY: Well, I wrote the date down wrong."
"LORELAI: Why would you do that?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You never write the date down wrong."
"RORY: Well, I wrote it down before we left and I wrote it down wrong."
"LORELAI: We were supposed to have a week."
"RORY: Well, we don't."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong."
"RORY: I can't believe you weren't gonna let me open the mail."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong."
"RORY: I can't believe you made us go to Ireland to stalk Bono."
"LORELAI: This isn't fair. You have more I-can't-believe's than I do."
"RORY: This sucks."
"LORELAI: This totally sucks."
"RORY: Well, I'm not ready. I haven't packed. I have things I need to get. We were supposed to watch the three Godfather's and Sofia dying over and over and eat our biscotti and -"
"LORELAI: Okay, listen, calm down. We just need to revise our plan."
"RORY: We were supposed to have a week."
"LORELAI: Okay, tonight we stay home and pack. Tomorrow we get up early. We'll get all the stuff you need, and that will give us time to watch at least two Godfather's and a Sofia dying. We'll still have a partial day and a great biscotti night."
"RORY: Chinese."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Food. Order it. Go."
"LORELAI: No, no time for full sentences!"
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: Ordering!"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory, each carrying several shopping bags, walk through the town square]"
"LORELAI: I'm so wiped. I shouldn't have taken that third Excedrin PM last night."
"RORY: Third? Why'd you take three?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, uh, originally I took two, then somewhere around four in the morning, I woke up and had a major Marilyn moment."
"RORY: Oh, no."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I forgot that I'd taken something and so I popped a third one and now I'm about ready to sleep with a Kennedy."
"RORY: Well, I hear Kerry's available."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's sit. God, Mr. Jet Lag wants to be my best friend."
"RORY: Well, do you wanna go home and rest?"
"LORELAI: No. We have a Godfather night to salvage. Check the list."
"RORY: Okay, we got the sheets, towels, bathroom shower caddy, and the basic first aid accoutrement. We still need to hit the beauty supply, the hardware store, stationery store."
"LORELAI: The mattress store."
"RORY: You do know that they supply you with a mattress at the dorm."
"LORELAI: Yeah. A mattress that decades of students in various states of cleanliness have slept on. Some without pajamas."
"RORY: Gross."
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"RORY: We've been running around for hours and this list isn't getting any shorter. We're never gonna finish."
"LORELAI: Stop. Yes, we are. We just need to split up. We'll get all this done quicker. I'll take the, uh, beauty supply and you take the stationery store, and we'll meet back here in twenty minutes."
"RORY: Okay. Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Well, I'm gonna walk right past that stupid grand opening."
"LORELAI: Well, I would take the stationery store, but you're so weird about what kind of pens you like."
"RORY: No, no. I'll just. . .I'll walk really fast. Maybe Taylor won't notice me."
"LORELAI: Yeah. You better walk really fast, like warp speed Mr. Sulu kind of fast."
"RORY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Twenty minutes!"
"[They go off in separate directions. Rory stops to listen to Taylor speaking to a crowd in front of the soda shop]"
"TAYLOR: …since these and many other flavors await your tongues at Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store. I wanna thank you all for coming here today to help us celebrate our grand opening. Now, originally we were supposed to have our Ice Cream Queen here, but unfortunately, kids, she was just too busy. She just couldn't find time in her busy queen schedule to come play with all of you here today."
"[a young girl in the crowd starts crying]"
"TAYLOR: I know, Christy, but take heart, we still have balloons and music, and as a special treat a little later, a skydiver is going to drop from the sky and land right here in front of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store. Isn't that great, kids? A skydiver who isn't too busy to come play with you will be here soon."
"CUT TO THE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Kirk."
"KIRK: Hello."
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm looking for a good daytime cream and a good nighttime cream."
"KIRK: For you?"
"LORELAI: No, for Rory."
"KIRK: Is she sensitive, prone to breakouts if the cream is too heavy?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"KIRK: I thought so. Okay, first of all, I would stay far away from that one."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"KIRK: Much too rich for her. This one is light with a fresh citrus scent and it is completely natural."
"LORELAI: We like that."
"KIRK: Now, for day, I would recommend something with a sunscreen. Rory has a classic peaches and cream complexion, and it would be a crime if, when she got older, her face started to look like a cowboy."
"LORELAI: I couldn't agree more."
"KIRK: All right. This should work."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"KIRK: You know, I heard you got back from your trip."
"LORELAI: Yup, I'm living proof."
"KIRK: Miss Patty showed me the castanets you brought her."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah?"
"KIRK: Yeah. And Andrew showed me the T-shirt from the Picasso museum. I must admit, I was a little jealous. I mean, I hate Picasso, but I love T-shirts."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"KIRK: And Pete seemed to really enjoy the Tower of London nutcracker you brought him."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: A nutcracker's a very useful thing to have around. I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting in my living room with a nut thinking, ""if only I had a way to crack this."""
"LORELAI: Okay, Kirk, I'm really sorry, we got a little messed up on the presents. It just got so crazy over there. I mean, we forgot to bring something back for Luke."
"KIRK: I heard he got jam."
"LORELAI: Fake jam."
"KIRK: I love fake jam."
"LORELAI: You know what, I'm gonna make this up to you, okay?"
"KIRK: Really?"
"LORELAI: I promise. We never meant to forget you."
"KIRK: Oh. Okay, well, sure. You can make it up to me."
"LORELAI: Okay. Now how much do I owe you?"
"KIRK: 45.50. You're, uh, you're lucky you came in when you did. I'm closing a little early today."
"LORELAI: Ooh, well, lucky me."
"KIRK: Yup. [he puts on a skydiver's backpack]"
"LORELAI: Kirk, no."
"KIRK: Taylor paid me twenty dollars to jump out of a plane for the grand opening."
"LORELAI: No."
"KIRK: But I took a lesson. The guy said I was a natural at falling."
"LORELAI: Kirk, listen to me, this is the best gift I could possibly give you - don't do that, okay?"
"KIRK: Do I still get the jam?"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory is walking down the street. Two young kids walk by.]"
"KID 1: Thanks a lot."
"KID 2: Yale can have you."
"[Lorelai walks up to Rory]"
"LORELAI: Honey. Hey, did you get your silly pens?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. Now I can mark these two things off, and we only have about ten thousand other things to do."
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: You know, I think the only way we're gonna get this all done is if we prioritize."
"RORY: Meaning?"
"LORELAI: Something has to go."
"RORY: Biscotti night."
"LORELAI: No, not biscotti night. I think we should bail on Friday night dinner."
"RORY: Cancel on Grandma?"
"LORELAI: Yes, cancel on Grandma."
"RORY: I can't do that."
"LORELAI: Rory, we need to get this stuff before tomorrow. There's no way we can do that if we have to drive all the way to Hartford and back. She'll understand. Well, the first part was true."
"RORY: I can't skip dinner."
"LORELAI: Come on, we're gonna go to dinner next week and every week after that for the rest of our lives. And I do mean the rest of our lives because my parents will outlive us. The damned can do that."
"RORY: Mom, I made a deal. This is why I get to go to Yale. I can't back out."
"LORELAI: It's our last night."
"RORY: I have to go. You don't have to, but I do."
"LORELAI: What do you mean I don't have to go?"
"RORY: I was very clear when I made this deal that it was only for me."
"LORELAI: You're right, I don't have to go. Boy, that's an oddly liberating feeling. I don't have to go. I don't have to go. I do not have to go to dinner."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Hang on, I'm not done. I do not have to go ever if I'm not in the mood."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I'm not going. I'll finish up all the errands."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. You go and you eat really fast and then get out of there. Meet me back here 9:30, 10 at the latest, and we'll do Godfather I through ""Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,"" and a quick Sofia dying."
"RORY: Deal."
"LORELAI: Remember, eat fast."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Bye."
"[They go off in separate directions. Taylor is still speaking to the crowd in front of the soda shop]"
"TAYLOR: Now just picture her sitting here just like this, smiling and waving. 'Hello kids, I'm the Ice Cream Queen.'"
"[Rory walks up to the microphone to speak to the crowd]"
"RORY: Okay, that's it. I humiliate myself at least six times a year for this town, and just because I'm going to Yale, that's not going to stop. Now the reason I am not the Ice Cream Queen is because Taylor never asked me. I didn't know about it, and that's why I was busy. Now I love this town, I will be back in that ridiculous pilgrim outfit at Thanksgiving, so everybody just get off my back."
"[She walks away as some people applaud]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings. Emily walks toward the door]"
"EMILY: Richard, they're here! Put those papers away and fix your tie."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"RORY: Hey, Grandma."
"EMILY: Hello, Rory."
"RORY: Nice to see you."
"EMILY: It's nice to see you, too. Come on in."
"RORY: I'm sorry I'm a little late."
"EMILY: Well, you're here now and that's all that matters. Shall we go into the living room?"
"RORY: Yes. Then I can give you your present."
"EMILY: My present? Well, that sounds very interesting."
"RORY: We bought it for you in Paris because Mom said you loved Paris the most."
"EMILY: I wonder what it could be."
"[They sit down in the living room. Rory hands her a gift]"
"RORY: For you."
"[Emily opens the gift, an Eiffel Tower figurine]"
"EMILY: Oh my, it's lovely, Rory, really. Just beautiful."
"RORY: It was between this and the Arc de Triumphe, but Mom said that the Eiffel Tower was fancier."
"EMILY: I agree, and I love it. Thank you."
"RORY: You're welcome."
"EMILY: So, where is your mother tonight? Not sick, I hope."
"RORY: Oh, no, she's fine. She just had some things to do."
"EMILY: Ah, things."
"RORY: Errands, actually."
"EMILY: Errands, of course."
"RORY: But she'll be here next week, and she says she's looking forward to it."
"[Richard walks into the room]"
"RICHARD: Emily, I'm expecting a call and there's nothing I can do about it, so please don't be upset when I leave the table. Rory, how lovely to see you. Well, how was the first European excursion?"
"RORY: It was perfect."
"EMILY: Lorelai had chores to do tonight."
"RICHARD: Chores?"
"EMILY: Errands, you know."
"RICHARD: Errands?"
"EMILY: Yes, that's why she didn't come, she had to run errands. But she'll be here next week, and she's looking forward to it. Isn't that nice?"
"RICHARD: I suppose."
"EMILY: I think so, too. Would you like to see my present?"
"RICHARD: Well, that's very nice. That'll fit right in with your collection, Emily."
"EMILY: Yes, it will."
"RORY: We got something for you, too, Grandpa. [hands him a gift]"
"RICHARD: Well, I guess you're not the only one who gets a treat tonight."
"EMILY: Oh, and just when I thought I was special."
"[Richard opens the gift, a pipe]"
"RICHARD: Look at that. That's beautiful."
"RORY: We found this amazing pipe store in Copenhagen and the man there can carve anything you want. His family's been doing it for over a hundred and fifty years. And they had a whole set of Alice in Wonderland pipes that Mom wanted to get, but they were way too expensive so we just got the Queen of Hearts."
"RICHARD: Well, I love it."
"EMILY: Yes, and you're gonna love it outside on the patio."
"RICHARD: As you wish, my dear. [the phone rings] That's my call, that's my call."
"EMILY: Hurry back, or we'll start without you."
"RICHARD: Five minutes. Ten, tops. [leaves room]"
"EMILY: He'll be an hour."
"RORY: Is his new business going well?"
"EMILY: Oh, who knows? He's not in the room long enough to find out."
"MAID: Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: All right, Gerta. Well, I guess we should go in and eat."
"RORY: What about Grandpa?"
"EMILY: Oh, we'll save him something."
"RORY: Okay."
"CUT TO THE DINING ROOM"
"[Emily, Richard, and Rory are eating dinner]"
"RICHARD: So, Rory, tell me, how were the g*n?"
"RORY: The who?"
"RICHARD: The g*n. Our friends in Zurich. The ones we told you two to look up when you got there."
"RORY: Oh, the g*n, right."
"RICHARD: I tell ya, they better have given you a first class welcome. Especially after that son of theirs squatted here for over a month last year."
"EMILY: And ruined the rug in the guest room."
"RICHARD: That's right. Hope you ruined one of their rugs as well."
"RORY: Actually, we, um, we didn't get a chance to see the g*n."
"RICHARD: Hm?"
"EMILY: Why not? Were they out of town?"
"RORY: Well, I -"
"RICHARD: You did go to Zurich, didn't you?"
"RORY: Yes, but, you know, Zurich was so crazy for us that we just figured, 'Ah, we'll just catch 'em next time.'"
"RICHARD: You didn't call them?"
"RORY: You know, there really wasn't time."
"RICHARD: Well, what about the Egerholms in Denmark? Is their new house a monstrosity?"
"RORY: Well, if you think Zurich was hectic, then Denmark was just. . .whoo!"
"RICHARD: You didn't call them?"
"RORY: Um, no."
"RICHARD: The Rezoscos in Florence?"
"RORY: No."
"RICHARD: The Talbots in London?"
"RORY: We were only in London for two days."
"RICHARD: Well, who did you look up when you went to Europe?"
"RORY: Jim Morrison says hello."
"RICHARD: You didn't look up one of our friends? We must've given you fifteen names."
"RORY: I know, but we got so caught up in the backpacking aspect of it that it just kind of slipped our minds."
"RICHARD: You know what that means, Emily. We're going to have to stay with the g*n when we go to Zurich in the fall."
"EMILY: Rory, would you like another piece of chicken?"
"RICHARD: Tiresome people."
"RORY: I've already had two, Grandma."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, why are we friends with them again?"
"EMILY: Well, just take it and nibble at it if you want to. Gerta, you can put the soufflé in now."
"RORY: Soufflé?"
"EMILY: Yes, we're going to have a special dessert, something to celebrate your homecoming."
"RICHARD: Well, why didn't she put it in the oven when we sat down to dinner? Those things take forever to cook."
"EMILY: You know, every time we go to Paris, I marvel at their ability to turn a simple meal into a three or four hour event. Makes every day seem like a party. So tonight, I thought we'd be European. I thought maybe we'd have a cheese plate before dessert and coffee. How does that sound? Bon?"
"RORY: Oh, yes. Very. . .bon."
"EMILY: It's nice to mix it up once in awhile. Oh, I have a wonderful idea. Rory, have you ever seen a ballroom dancing competition?"
"RORY: Uh, no."
"EMILY: You would love it. It is so exciting, and the costumes are beautiful. I've been taping them since 1978. Can you imagine?"
"RORY: No."
"EMILY: All right, then. After dessert, you and I are going to hunker down in that den that we never use and I am pulling out those tapes. We'll just start at the beginning and see how far we get. Perfect, here's the cheese. I'll take that, Gerta. Richard, do you want to start?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Luke are loading Rory's things for Yale into the back of Luke's truck]"
"LUKE: Jeez, you think you go to a fancy school like Yale there'd be a mattress in the room."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Go figure, huh?"
"LUKE: You packed her stuff in Hefty bags?"
"LORELAI: Hey, she's lucky I even had these in the house."
"LUKE: If you needed luggage, you should've asked me."
"LORELAI: You have luggage?"
"LUKE: Yes, I have luggage. Why wouldn't I have luggage?"
"LORELAI: You never go anywhere."
"LUKE: I just went on a seven-country cruise."
"LORELAI: That's right, the mystery cruise that you don't wanna talk about."
"LUKE: I told you I brought luggage. What more info do you need?"
"LORELAI: Why won't you tell me what happened?"
"LUKE: Because."
"LORELAI: Why? Luke, I swear, I'm dying to know, but every time I bring it up, you spaz out. Why won't you tell me? I would tell you."
"LUKE: Yes, but I wouldn't wanna know."
"LORELAI: Did something happen with you and Nicole?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: What? Did you propose?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, you proposed?"
"LUKE: Yes, I proposed."
"LORELAI: This is big. This is huge."
"LUKE: There's more."
"LORELAI: There's more? Okay, well, what? Did she say yes?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: She said yes. You proposed and she said yes. Wow, I -"
"LUKE: There's more."
"LORELAI: And there's more after you proposed and she said yes? What, you -"
"LUKE: We got married."
"LORELAI: You got married? How could you get married?"
"LUKE: We asked the captain and he married us."
"LORELAI: And that's legal?"
"LUKE: Apparently."
"LORELAI: So you're married? You're legally married? This is just -"
"LUKE: Actually, there's a little more."
"LORELAI: And she's pregnant. Oh my God, you finally reproduced."
"LUKE: We're getting divorced."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna sit down now."
"LUKE: It just all happened so fast."
"LORELAI: Well, yeah."
"[they sit down on the front porch steps]"
"LUKE: I mean, you're on this boat in the middle of nowhere and everything's moving and you feel weird all the time. There's this endless supply of food and drink. Uh, midnight buffets, by the way, are the reason the rest of the world hates us. And everyone around us was either in love, engaged, or celebrating their hundredth wedding anniversary, and we were having a good time. . . and there you go."
"LORELAI: There you go."
"LUKE: Of course, the next morning we both woke up and realized we'd lost our minds. We tried to ignore it for awhile, you know, went snorkeling, but by the time we hit land, we were separated, and now we're getting divorced."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, my jet lag and your love life is making me dizzy. Is there more?"
"LUKE: Nope, that's it."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"LUKE: Ah, it's okay."
"LORELAI: Well, look on the bright side. I mean, now that you've been married, it'll silence all those questions."
"LUKE: What questions?"
"LORELAI: You know, a single man of a certain age who lives alone."
"LUKE: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: Hey, I always defended you. I always said, ""Hey, so what if he is?"""
"LUKE: Thank you for your support."
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello?"
"RORY: She's taken me hostage."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: She's not letting me leave. Dinner lasted an hour. She didn't even put the soufflé in the oven until we'd already finished, and now we're watching taped ballroom dancing competitions that date back to the 1800's."
"LORELAI: You haven't left yet?"
"RORY: Are you listening to me? I can't leave. She won't let me leave ever. This is Iran in '79 and you are Jimmy Carter. What do we do?"
"LORELAI: Well, first we have to lose the Jimmy Carter comparison, and second, I have to come get you. This is about me and me not showing up, so maybe if I put in an appearance, she'll let you go."
"RORY: Okay, but come quickly because she's got a lot of tapes and they rewind really slow."
"LORELAI: I'm on my way. [hangs up] Um, hey, so, uh, I have to go get Rory."
"LUKE: Everything okay?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah. You know, my mother's a psycho, so. . .business as usual."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Thanks for the help."
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: And I am sorry."
"LUKE: I'll be fine."
"[Kirk walks by in a skydiver's outfit, trailing a parachute behind him]"
"KIRK: Strong wind."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[In the den, Emily puts a ballroom dancing tape into the VCR, then sits next to Rory on the couch]"
"EMILY: Now I think you're really going to see quite a difference from the early eighties. They really start to mix it up in '88."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"EMILY: Oh, see right there, see that move? Five years ago it was not allowed. Could've gotten you kicked right out."
"RORY: That's harsh."
"EMILY: Oh, yes. Ballroom dancing can be very harsh. Oh, look. The couple in the purple feathers - that's Corky and Shirley Ballas. I love them, they are so talented. Corky's actually writing a musical based on their life as ballroom champions, and their son, Corky Jr., is going to play him as a young man."
"RORY: Wow. Two Corky's in one show. Don't see that everyday."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Mom, hi!"
"LORELAI: There you guys are."
"EMILY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Well, you know, it's funny, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and I thought to myself, I wonder what's doing at the Gilmore house."
"RORY: We're watching National Ballroom Dancing competitions."
"LORELAI: You are? Well, that sounds fun. Mind if I watch with you?"
"EMILY: I don't think you'd enjoy it."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I'm sure I would."
"EMILY: Well, you've already missed the beginning."
"LORELAI: I'm betting you could catch me up."
"EMILY: Rory, would you go ask Gerta if she would make me some tea?"
"RORY: Uh, sure, Grandma. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: No, nothing for me, Mom. Thanks. Um, so what's new?"
"EMILY: Well, you obviously weren't just in the neighborhood, so why don't you tell me what you're doing here?"
"LORELAI: Uh, you know, I came to see you."
"EMILY: You came to get Rory."
"LORELAI: Mom, she's been here for hours. Patty Hearst had a shorter incarceration."
"EMILY: She's not being held hostage, Lorelai. I resent that. She's spending time with me, something you obviously don't want to do."
"LORELAI: Mom, I'm sorry I missed dinner tonight."
"EMILY: Come to dinner, don't come to dinner, it makes no difference to me. You are under no obligation to us any longer."
"LORELAI: I know, but -"
"EMILY: You're very busy, I understand. I wouldn't wanna keep you any longer."
"LORELAI: Mom, please, let me take Rory with me."
"EMILY: No. Tonight is my night with Rory."
"LORELAI: You're keeping her from me on purpose."
"EMILY: If Rory wants to leave, she can ask to leave. She's not a four-year old."
"LORELAI: Well, she's not gonna hurt your feelings by asking to leave."
"EMILY: Why should she? She knows you'll be along any second to do it for her."
"LORELAI: Mom, why do you always make everything so hard? Don't you understand, this is my last night with my daughter! She goes off to college tomorrow!"
"EMILY: I know, which is why I was so surprised you didn't want to spend the evening with her."
"LORELAI: I do!"
"EMILY: Then you should've come!"
"LORELAI: I couldn't!"
"EMILY: You wouldn't!"
"LORELAI: Ugh, I swear to God! Where's Dad?"
"EMILY: Oh, he went to bed hours ago."
"LORELAI: He went to bed?"
"EMILY: Well, it was getting late."
"[Lorelai laughs a little]"
"EMILY: Why are you laughing?"
"LORELAI: Um, you know, you've got Rory locked in here with the Mambo Kings, and, um, and Dad went to bed."
"EMILY: So what? Why is that funny?"
"LORELAI: Because. . .you know, she's here and he's there and. . .God, I'm so tired."
"[Lorelai keeps laughing. Rory walks in]"
"RORY: What's so funny?"
"EMILY: Oh, she's having a fit."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. [laughs harder]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I just got the Jimmy Carter reference."
"[Lorelai and Rory laugh]"
"EMILY: As soon as you're both done. . ."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory are watching ballroom dancing in the den]"
"RORY: Oh, watch this. This part's really good."
"LORELAI: Ouch, that has got to hurt."
"RORY: Cool, huh?"
"LORELAI: Extremely. Plus, the whole matching haircut thing adds a level of commitment to their act that the other acts just lack. Oh, hey, careful where you put the hand there, mister."
"RORY: You know they rehearse every night, plus they have classes, plus they go to the gym four times a week?"
"LORELAI: Hm. Oh my God, she's balancing on his hand. He is like Superman. Or Wonder Woman. Either way, he's very strong."
"RORY: So, tomorrow. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah, tomorrow."
"RORY: It's a big day."
"LORELAI: It's a really big day."
"RORY: I just hope it's everything I've been imagining it to be."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I just hope you actually get there."
"[they glance at Emily sleeping on the other couch, then continue watching the television]"
"LORELAI: You know, if Sofia could just die during a fox trot, that would be perfect."
"RORY: Biscotti?"
"LORELAI: Yes, please."
"[Rory hands her one from the bag]"
"LORELAI: They're all broken."
"RORY: I know. I like 'em that way."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks out of her bedroom with some beauty products. She goes into the living room to pack them in a suitcase]"
"RORY: I've got too much stuff."
"LORELAI: [calls from upstairs] What?"
"RORY: Stuff! And it's your fault. You inculcated into me a tolerance for rampant consumerism."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: When did I become one of those girls with dozens of beauty products, none of which are expendable? It used to be a touch of mascara, dab of Coppertone, zip, bam, boom, out the door."
"LORELAI: I heard copper and boom."
"RORY: Never mind. And what's going on? We're late."
"LORELAI: I'm looking for the camera."
"RORY: Oy vey, she's looking for the camera."
"LORELAI: I heard that."
"RORY: That she hears."
"[Lorelai comes down the steps]"
"LORELAI: It is my prerogative as your mother to record any event in my daughter's life that I so choose. It's in the mother's handbook."
"RORY: Does Luke know that you can't drive a stick?"
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because you borrowed his truck and it's a stick."
"LORELAI: I can drive a stick."
"RORY: You can stir coffee with a stick, but you can't drive a stick."
"LORELAI: Okay, I am glad I did not choose to record that particular moment in my daughter's life 'cause that was just ugly."
"RORY: I just want you to get there in one piece."
"LORELAI: You look out for me."
"RORY: Let's hit the road."
"LORELAI: Oh, wait, wait, this is it! This is the precise moment that I've been looking for. This is my daughter going off to college, this is my sh*t!"
"RORY: Okay, fine."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm lining you up, now look candid."
"RORY: Okay, see, the very definition of candid means that the subject doesn't know the picture's being taken."
"LORELAI: So forget the camera's there."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: And smile."
"RORY: Okay, okay."
"[Lorelai takes a picture]"
"LORELAI: I'm not happy."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: It looks posed."
"RORY: How about this?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, you know the stick we were talking about before? It looks like it's somewhere else now."
"RORY: You're having serious Annie Leibovitz delusions here."
"LORELAI: But it just looks like you're standing in the house. No one will know that you're going off to college."
"RORY: Shall I hold a sign?"
"LORELAI: Or you could do the ""going off to college"" walk."
"RORY: The what?"
"LORELAI: The walk, the this. [imitates the walk]"
"RORY: You look like Alfalfa coming to pick up Darla."
"LORELAI: Here, hold some of your stuff. At least it'll look like you're moving or something."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Ugh, it looks like you're taking out the trash."
"RORY: Okay, that's it, we're going."
"LORELAI: All right. I'll just have to make do with one of the pictures I already took."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: Ooh, I'll put it on the computer and then superimpose an important person standing next to you seeing you off, like Kissinger or Lady Bird Johnson or Pat Summerall or something."
"RORY: Pat Summerall?"
"LORELAI: Well, you think of somebody better."
"RORY: Orson Welles."
"LORELAI: It can't be a dead person."
"RORY: Pat Summerall's dead."
"LORELAI: No, he's not."
"RORY: Pat Summerall is dead."
"LORELAI: No, I'm telling you, he's not. Lady Bird Johnson is dead."
"RORY: No, she's not."
"LORELAI: How much you wanna bet?"
"RORY: Five bucks."
"LORELAI: Let's google him right now."
"RORY: Mom, Yale?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Yale can wait for us to google Pat Summerall."
"RORY: Come."
"LORELAI: Where are your priorities?"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory walks in and sits at the counter]"
"RORY: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Hey, Rory. Isn't today Yale?"
"RORY: Um, yeah, I'm going right now."
"LUKE: You look so calm. How do you feel?"
"RORY: A little nervous, but a last Luke's fix before I go will help."
"LUKE: Well, today is whatever you want on the house."
"RORY: Wow, I feel important."
"LUKE: You are important. Where's your mom?"
"RORY: She's coming. She's having a wee bit of trouble with your truck."
"[Luke looks out the window and sees Lorelai backing his truck toward the diner]"
"LUKE: What is she doing?"
"RORY: Well, she, uh, backed the truck out of our driveway all fine and everything, but once she hit the road, she couldn't get it out of reverse, so she -"
"LUKE: Backed it here?"
"RORY: Slow but steady."
"[Luke walks outside to the truck]"
"LORELAI: Something's wrong with your truck."
"LUKE: Nothing's wrong with my truck. Stop the truck."
"LORELAI: It won't go out of reverse."
"LUKE: You can't drive a stick."
"LORELAI: I can't drive an uncooperative stick."
"LUKE: My stick's not uncooperative. Come on, hit the brakes."
"[Lorelai stops the truck and gets out. Luke gets in]"
"LORELAI: Okay, good luck. I don't think it's gonna happen."
"[Luke drives the truck forward and parks it along the curb]"
"LORELAI: This is a misogynistic truck!"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's anti-woman, it's gender-selective, it's ""Oh, let's drink a beer and watch the game and hike our shorts up."""
"[Luke gets out of the truck and they start walking toward the diner]"
"LUKE: I changed my mind, you can't borrow my truck."
"LORELAI: But it's full of our stuff."
"LUKE: You should've hired movers."
"LORELAI: You could've said no when I asked to borrow the truck."
"LUKE: You said you could drive a stick."
"LORELAI: Yeah, not the Joe Sixpack of sticks. Not the ""Oh, let's scratch our bellies and eat some corn nuts and pick our teeth."""
"[they walk into the diner]"
"LORELAI: Really, Luke, I can drive it."
"LUKE: Okay, fine. Just be careful and have it back by four."
"LORELAI: Four-ish it is."
"LUKE: Four, I need it at four."
"LORELAI:: Give or take a few min-"
"LUKE: Four."
"LORELAI:: God, he's so possessive about the stupid truck."
"LUKE: It's my truck, I possess it!"
"LORELAI:: I'm just kidding. I'll have it back by four, calm down."
"LUKE: Okay, I'm just. . .I'm not in much of a kidding mood with all this other stuff going on. Divorce papers. Fun, huh?"
"LORELAI: Zero fun. Sorry, Luke."
"LUKE: It's not that I wasn't expecting them, it's just. . .the law firm that Nicole works for sent them. I called with a simple question they could've answered over the phone, but they insisted on sending someone down to see me."
"LORELAI: I take it you're not looking forward to that."
"LUKE: I'm about to build a moat of fire."
"CAESAR: Here you go, Rory. [hands her a bag]"
"RORY: Thanks, Caesar. Since we were short on time, I had them make us something to go. My Yale special."
"LORELAI: Oh, share, share."
"RORY: Sausage wrapped in a pancake tied together with bacon."
"LORELAI: You made that up?"
"RORY: I don't know how I do it."
"LUKE: Here. [shows Lorelai a piece of paper]"
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"LUKE: A shift diagram for the truck, nice and simple. D is for drive, R is for -"
"LORELAI: The R in drive!"
"LUKE: R is for reverse."
"LORELAI: Right, reverse."
"LUKE: And one is -"
"LORELAI: The loneliest number that you'll ever know!"
"LUKE: The first gear."
"LORELAI: I know, Luke. Really, I can handle it."
"LUKE: I hope so."
"RORY: Thanks, Luke."
"LUKE: Good luck, Rory. [sees a man enter the diner] Oh, goody, a guy in a suit."
"LORELAI: Good luck to you."
"[Lorelai and Rory leave; the man walks up to Luke]"
"RUSSELL:"
"MR. Danes?"
"LUKE: Unfortunately."
"RUSSELL: I'm Russell Bynes. I'm with Blodgett, Sage, Albet, Pettruccio, Stein, Lemming, and Stein, attorneys for Nicole Diana Leahy."
"LUKE: And the sun just went down, thanks for coming."
"RUSSELL: Pardon me?"
"LUKE: You're wasting your time. I had a simple question, where do I sign? It didn't require a personal visit."
"RUSSELL: Whoa, whoa, there's no place to sign because this is just a document informing the defendant of the type of action being filed."
"LUKE: What are you talking about? Who's the defendant?"
"RUSSELL: You are."
"LUKE: Oh my God."
"RUSSELL: Didn't you read the papers?"
"LUKE: Yeah, the Red Sox lost by three, Bush is at the ranch chatting up a Swiss dude."
"RUSSELL: The divorce papers."
"LUKE: I know what you meant. Look, I didn't k*ll anyone. Nicole and I just kind of accidentally got married and now we want out. We both want the same thing."
"RUSSELL: Don't try to play me,"
"MR. Danes."
"LUKE: I'm too busy for this."
"RUSSELL: Fine, because I should just be dealing with your legal representation."
"LUKE: I don't believe this."
"RUSSELL: Not giving us your lawyer's information is only going to prolong the process."
"LUKE: Okay, if I give you my lawyer's name, will you leave?"
"RUSSELL: I will leave."
"LUKE: Okay, you ready?"
"RUSSELL: Yes."
"LUKE: His name is Don Dewey. He works at the firm of Dewey. . ."
"RUSSELL: Dewey."
"LUKE: Cheatham. . ."
"RUSSELL: Cheatham."
"LUKE: And Howe."
"RUSSELL: Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe. That was very immature."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, tickled me."
"RUSSELL: My bosses are gonna wanna hear this."
"LUKE: Oh, come on, they've heard that one before. Oh, hey, if you want Don's number, it's 555-5555."
"[Russell leaves. Lorelai walks back in holding out the stick shift diagram]"
"LUKE: I thought you were gone."
"LORELAI: Nothing's where it says it is."
"[Luke flips the paper over]"
"LORELAI: It's gonna be fine."
"CUT TO YALE UNIVERSITY"
"[Lorelai is standing in a parking space in the street in front of the school. Rory pulls up in her car]"
"RORY: Nice score!"
"LORELAI: Thank you. Oh, and later, I'll, uh, point out the seven or so fellow Yalies who already hate you because your obnoxious mother wouldn't let them park in the only open spot left."
"RORY: Oh, goody. You get the truck here okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, we had some bickering, but we made it."
"[a girl walks over to them]"
"TESS: Hello. Name?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. I was told it was okay to hold the spot. A guy told me, I forget his name. He had, uh, like, a jacket."
"TESS: It's okay. I was just wondering what our newcomer's name is."
"RORY: Rory Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Right, Rory Gilmore"
"TESS: [checks list] Rory Gilmore, Rory Gilmore. . . there you are. Welcome to Yale."
"LORELAI: Oh, hold the shake, hold the shake."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Wait, lens cap, lens cap."
"RORY: Sorry."
"TESS: They all do this."
"LORELAI: Shake. [takes picture] Got it. Who are you?"
"TESS: I'm Tess, I'm Rory's freshman counselor. I'll be living in the building and be there for whatever she needs."
"LORELAI: And you look twenty-one, convenient for beer runs."
"TESS: I'll be giving a tour for Durfee girls you should not miss."
"RORY: Oh, I know. Tour's at twelve, followed by the optional express lunch twelve to two, which is all followed by the telecommunications orientation and internet ID distribution, parents' reception eleven to one."
"TESS: You memorized the schedule."
"LORELAI: Yeah, she's not weird or anything, she just has a good memory."
"TESS: And I see you brought your own mattress."
"LORELAI: Oh, right. See, the guy. . .name, name, name. I forget his name. Three syllables. Uh, he said it was okay, and he had, like, a mustache."
"TESS: It's allowed as long as you make arrangements to dispose of the one that was already there. Did you do that?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we did."
"RORY: Yes."
"TESS: Good. Get your camera ready."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"TESS: I'm giving Rory her key."
"LORELAI: Thanks for the warning. [takes picture]"
"TESS: See you at the tour."
"RORY: Yes, Tess, thank you."
"[Tess walks away]"
"RORY: So, she's nice."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I'm dying to see your room. Come on, grab a bag."
"RORY: So, you made arrangements to get rid of the old mattress?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I did."
"RORY: Really?"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"RORY: Because it specifically says here that you're supposed to make arrangements to have the old mattress picked up before arrival."
"LORELAI: Ooh, very grand."
"RORY: So, what time are the mattress guys coming?"
"LORELAI: Uh, later today sometime."
"RORY: So we have to wait in the room for them, or. . ."
"LORELAI: I think they just let themselves in. Here we are."
"RORY: So do the mattress guys have their own key?"
"LORELAI: All right, I confess, I didn't call the mattress guys."
"RORY: Well, what are we gonna do?"
"LORELAI: We'll find a dumpster."
"RORY: Mom, they could trace it back to me."
"LORELAI: I'll be long gone by then."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: All right, we'll burn it before we dump it. A match, a little gasoline."
"RORY: We're here five minutes and we're already contemplating felonies."
"[Lorelai unlocks Rory's dorm suite and they walk inside]"
"LORELAI: Just like I pictured it."
"RORY: Did you see an emergency exit?"
"LORELAI: A fireplace, too! I wonder if it's woodburning."
"RORY: It says here, ""Upon arrival, please take note of the emergency exits."""
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, we could burn the mattress in there, save us a trip."
"RORY: Aw, man, a piece of my map ripped off."
"LORELAI: Which one's your room?"
"RORY: I'm missing half of the Old Campus."
"LORELAI: R.G. This is it."
"RORY: If I have Old Campus activities today, I'm screwed."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Here it is. Here's where you're going to be thinking all those impressive thoughts. It's just waiting for your decorative stamp. And a little air freshener."
"RORY: Where's the phone jack?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, Jack. Where is the pesky phone?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: You're one-note Nancy today."
"RORY: Ah, here's a place to get replacement maps. Aw, holy cow, it's in Old Campus!"
"LORELAI: All right, that's it."
"RORY: Hey, what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: You just missed it."
"RORY: Missed what?"
"LORELAI: Walking into your dorm suite for the first time. Do over."
"[Lorelai leads Rory back out to the hallway]"
"RORY: What? We're short on time here and we haven't unloaded."
"LORELAI: It doesn't matter. You're gonna be in the moment."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: You're gonna be in the moment or the rest of the map gets it."
"RORY: No. Okay, I'm here, I swear."
"LORELAI: You're not placating me?"
"RORY: I'll try. Really, I'm all here."
"LORELAI: Good. Oh, here's your suite."
"RORY: Cool."
"[they walk inside]"
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"RORY: It is cool. My own space."
"LORELAI: Well, yours and P.G.'s and J.B.'s and T.S.'s."
"RORY: And a fireplace. Did you see the fireplace?"
"LORELAI: Was this do over justified or what?"
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"RORY: You mentioned thoughts in here?"
"LORELAI: Mm, all the great ones you're gonna have."
"RORY: And air freshener?"
"LORELAI: That, too."
"RORY: Thanks for putting me in the moment."
"LORELAI: My pleasure."
"RORY: It's something I would have not wanted to miss."
"LORELAI: Good. And thank you."
"RORY: For what?"
"LORELAI: For pretending that you're not at this moment thinking about missing your tour, finding your phone jack, navigating the Old Campus."
"RORY: It's my gift to you."
"LORELAI: Let's go unload and get you a new map."
"RORY: Bless you."
"CUT TO YALE COURTYARD"
"[Rory is in her freshman orientation tour]"
"TESS: Just keep in mind, guys, the dining hall hours are cast in stone - you snooze, you lose. And it's a post-9/11 world, so your ID's are important. You'll be asked for it a lot, so always have it, always, always. It also operates the laundry machines and is also your meal card. That's right, it's practically magic, so don't lose it."
"[Another tour group walks by]"
"TOUR GUIDE: If you're stupid enough to get ripped, I'm here to help, but I do not hold buckets, if you get my drift. Now, pay attention to street parking, it is severely restricted in most places. Walk or take the shuttle when you can."
"TESS: First floor Durfee."
"TOUR GUIDE: Third floor Bingham."
"TESS: They're babies."
"TOUR GUIDE: Tots. Third floor Bingham, through the gate, make a left."
"TESS: Get an internet ID whether you think you'll use it or not. It'll be your name at yale.edu, and there's no changing what you get."
"GIRL: Think there's gonna be a test?"
"RORY: Probably not. Oh, you were joking. Good one."
"TESS: No bottlenecks, girls. There's about a hundred behind you waiting for the same stuff. Do not get precious about your ID pictures. They are what they are."
"GIRL: Did you get that down? They are what they are."
"RORY: I'll remember."
"PHOTO GUY: Next!"
"GIRL: That would be you."
"RORY: What?"
"PHOTO GUY: It's picture time."
"RORY: Oh, sorry. [sits down to get her picture taken] I didn't think pictures were today. Do you mind if I take a second to -"
"PHOTO GUY: One thousand and one. [takes picture] Next!"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory's tour group walks into the dorm]"
"TESS: Always have your keys. Never open the door to someone you don't know. Walk in twos at night. That's it, any questions? Later on, you'll have questions. I'll be around. Now go do stuff."
"[Rory walks into her suite. A girl follows her in and sits down in the common room. Rory goes into her bedroom, then peeks out at the girl. Lorelai enters the suite.]"
"LORELAI: Rory, you back?"
"[Lorelai goes into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Who is that?"
"RORY: I don't know. She just followed me in here like a puppy dog without saying a word."
"LORELAI: Maybe she's lost."
"RORY: Or maybe she's one of my new suitemates who I'm already off to a swell start with."
"LORELAI: Do you know how vulnerable you are to venereal disease?"
"RORY: All hail to the queen of the non-sequiturs."
"LORELAI: This parent orientation I went to was a nonstop litany of the horrors awaiting college freshman. You're supposed to carry a whistle, a flashlight, a crucifix, and a loaded Glock with you at all times."
"RORY: We should go out there. She'll think we're hiding."
"LORELAI: Okay, just don't shake hands with her. Bacteria."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Or tell her where you live."
"RORY: Too late."
"LORELAI: Oh, you touched the doorknob."
"RORY: Good grief."
"[they open the door]"
"LORELAI: Say something."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Anything. Go, go."
"[they walk out into the common room]"
"RORY: Hi."
"TANNA: Hi. [pause] I'm adopted."
"RORY: You're up."
"LORELAI: What's your name?"
"TANNA: Tanna Schrick."
"LORELAI: Well, Tanna Schrick, good. We're making some progress. Hi, Tanna Schrick. I'm Lorelai, this is Rory. She'll be living here, too."
"RORY: We're suitemates."
"TANNA: As they're ransacking your room, professional thieves typically start at the bottom drawer and work their way up. That way they don't have to close drawers before opening the next one. Saves time."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, no storing your valuables in the bottom drawer. Got that, Rory? Good tip, Tanna. Thanks."
"TANNA: I'm not so great at extemporaneous speaking, so I've memorized some quick conversational facts I can whip out at a moment's notice. Oh, when I get to know you better, I'll memorize some facts that are more specific to your person."
"LORELAI: Tanna, how old are you?"
"TANNA: Sixteen."
"RORY: Sixteen?"
"TANNA: On Tuesday."
"LORELAI: Happy birthday, Doogie."
"TANNA: Thank you."
"LORELAI: And, uh, where are your parents?"
"TANNA: Oh, at the hotel. Mom's napping, Dad's getting a schvitz."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, we still have some more stuff to do, but maybe your parents will be here when I get back. I'd love to meet them."
"TANNA: Yeah, well, they make a very good first impression."
"LORELAI: I'm sure they do. See you later, kiddo."
"RORY: Bye."
"TANNA: Oh, hey, um, Rory?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"TANNA: You nervous?"
"RORY: Oh yeah."
"TANNA: Okay, good."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out to the hallway]"
"LORELAI: Odd, but nice."
"RORY: I'll take it."
"LORELAI: So. . .this is it."
"RORY: This is it."
"LORELAI: Learn a lot of stuff."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: And, uh, you know, keep in touch."
"RORY: Well, we'll at least exchange Christmas cards."
"LORELAI: With a letter detailing what's happened over the year."
"RORY: And a current photo."
"LORELAI: Don't joke!"
"RORY: You started it."
"LORELAI: I was masking my pain."
"RORY: You'll see plenty of me."
"LORELAI: It's not enough."
"RORY: How about tons?"
"LORELAI: That's better. I love you, did you know that?"
"RORY: I always suspected it."
"[as they hug, someone bumps into them with a box]"
"LORELAI: Oh, excuse me. A little fridge."
"RORY: It's"
"CUTe."
"LORELAI: I want one."
"RORY: Well, go get yourself one."
"LORELAI: For you, I want one for you."
"RORY: I don't need one."
"LORELAI: For sodas and stuff when things are closed. Late night cram sessions."
"RORY: I guess it would come in handy."
"LORELAI: Oh, let's see what these people have going on. [peeks into a room]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: A rug! A rug for your room to make it cozy. And a vase of flowers."
"RORY: Well, the flowers will just die."
"LORELAI: They have a vase of the most beautiful fake flowers I've ever seen. Trash cans!"
"RORY: Oh, you're right."
"LORELAI: And a fan. I have been remiss."
"RORY: No, you haven't."
"LORELAI: I have got another trip to make today."
"RORY: No, Mom, you've done enough today."
"LORELAI: I want you fully outfitted and settled for your first night or I won't sleep."
"RORY: We can get it all later."
"LORELAI: No, no. Now go unpack the skimpy amount of stuff I've gotten you so far and I'll be back in a couple of hours. Copper boom."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: It's what you said to me this morning when you were trying to speed me up."
"RORY: But you missed a bunch of stuff in between."
"LORELAI: I think it's catchy. Go, go, unpack."
"RORY: Copper boom!"
"LORELAI: Copper boom!"
"[They walk off in separate directions. Lorelai passes a guy carrying a container of stuff and she looks in it to see what he brought.]"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Copper boom!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke. [sees three lawyers sitting at a table] Oops."
"LUKE: sh**t me."
"LORELAI: Now, or maybe later so you're surprised?"
"[Luke walks over to the table of lawyers]"
"MR. STEIN 1:"
"MR. Danes, a marriage contract is a contract just like any other."
"MR. STEIN 2: As the higher wage earner, Nicole wants a fair settlement."
"LUKE: But I want nothing from her, so there's nothing to settle,"
"MR. . . what's your name again?"
"MR. STEIN 1: My name is Stein."
"LUKE: I thought you were Stein."
"MR. STEIN 2: I'm Stein as well."
"LUKE: Well, then I'm confused."
"MR. BLODGETT:"
"MR. Danes, I'm an impatient man, I'm a busy man, I'm a sensible man, I'm a skeptical man."
"LUKE: Oh, you're four different men, huh? Well, are they all named Stein, too?"
"MR. BLODGETT: If there's one thing I've learned in this business, it's that no one wants nothing."
"MR. STEIN 2: Why won't you hire a lawyer?"
"LUKE: Why? Because lawyers waste time and money. They're needless middlemen who slither into people's lives when they're at their most vulnerable so they can clamp on and suck like leeches until everyone but them is distraught and penniless."
"MR. STEIN 1: Well, I can see why the marriage went bad."
"MR. BLODGETT: Here's fair warning,"
"MR. Danes - if you don't hire a lawyer, you could wind up getting absolutely nothing."
"LUKE: That's what I want!"
"MR. STEIN 1: There he goes again."
"MR. STEIN 2: Maybe we should get Sage and Albet into this."
"MR. STEIN 1: Hm. Pettruccio, too."
"[Luke walks over to Lorelai at the counter]"
"LUKE: They're gonna multiply like the matrix."
"LORELAI: Oh, well. . ."
"[Luke brings Lorelai over to the lawyers]"
"LUKE: Tell them, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Huh? Tell them what?"
"MR. BLODGETT: Who's this?"
"LUKE: This is Lorelai."
"MR. STEIN 1: Are you an attorney?"
"LUKE: No, she's carbon-based."
"MR. STEIN 2: And what's her role?"
"LUKE: Uh, be my character witness or something."
"LORELAI: Right, okay. Well, I can vouch for this man. I mean, I know he cared for Nicole, and apparently they both got a little rash. I mean, not in 'apply to affected area twice daily' rash, I mean rash in that they hastily entered into a union."
"MR. BLODGETT: We know all this."
"LORELAI: But if you think he married her to get something, I know that's not true. He's basically a hermit, and happy to be one. I could show you his place upstairs. I mean, you half expect Hari Krishnas to jump out of the bathroom banging tambourines. All he likes is fishing and watching baseball, and he's got a reel and he's got a TV, so he's all set. So when he says he wants nothing, I know he means it, because when I think of Luke Danes, I think nothing."
"LUKE:"
"MR. Blodgett, Steins one and two, there you go."
"MR. STEIN 1: Your choice of character witness does nothing to allay our concerns."
"LORELAI: Sorry. [goes back to the counter]"
"MR. BLODGETT: The bottom line, time. If we do not receive a response in this matter, we're just going to have to kick this up a notch."
"LUKE: Okay, there is something I want, but I've been holding back."
"MR. BLODGETT: As we suspected."
"MR. STEIN 2: Let's hear it."
"LUKE: Okay, you know Nicole and I went on a cruise, right?"
"MR. STEIN 2: Oh boy."
"MR. STEIN 1: Oh yeah."
"LUKE: Well, the first night on the boat we, uh, went to see an act that everyone was raving about. We go in, sit down, they close the door. Turned out to be a guy playing musical drinking glasses. You know, with the half-filled cups that give off different tones. He played Mozart, and I swear I could hear Mozart banging on his coffin. Out of politeness, we stayed, and there went an hour of our lives. Next night, the sign in front of the theater said the entertainment for the night was a guy singing the songs of Sinatra. We verified with the guy at the door, the songs of Frank Sinatra, right? Not Tina, not Frank Jr., not Bill Sinatra, but Ol' Blue Eyes. ""Yes,"" he says. ""It's like Frank come to life."" We go in, sit down, they close the door. Then they announce that the guy singing Sinatra is sick and the glass-playing guy is filling in. Out he comes, there's goes another hour. Next night, we meet a nice couple while walking the Lido Deck. Had some nice conversation, so we have dinner with th"
"MR. BLODGETT: We'll have to confer on this."
"MR. STEIN 1: Maybe do a productivity study."
"LUKE: Yeah, get Blobb, Fromm and Pinnuccio in there, too."
"MR. BLODGETT: We'll get back to you."
"LUKE: I have no doubt."
"[the lawyers leave. Luke sits next to Lorelai at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Wow."
"LUKE: I'm exhausted."
"LORELAI: Sorry I barged in like that."
"LUKE: Trust me, the interruption was welcome."
"LORELAI: So, did you check the clock? It's not yet four."
"LUKE: Rory safe and sound?"
"LORELAI: Safe and sound."
"LUKE: And the truck?"
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"LUKE: You wrecked it."
"LORELAI: It's not wrecked."
"LUKE: I don't see it."
"LORELAI: It's around the corner."
"LUKE: You wrecked it."
"LORELAI: No, but I need to use it awhile longer."
"LUKE: Because you wrecked it and it's in the shop."
"LORELAI: You really can't afford to alienate your chief character witness."
"[they walk outside to the truck]"
"LUKE: It's full of stuff."
"LORELAI: I know."
"LUKE: Why didn't you unload it?"
"LORELAI: I did, this is my second load."
"LUKE: You didn't say anything about a second load."
"LORELAI: I didn't know I had to have one 'til I realized what a piker of a mother I'd been compared to the other kids' moms."
"LUKE: It's still running."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, turns out that ignition key is just as misogynistic as that stick shift of yours."
"LUKE: You just have to jiggle it a little."
"LORELAI: You didn't mention any jiggling."
"LUKE: It's common sense."
"LORELAI: Oh, that."
"LUKE: Wait, why is the mattress still there?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's not the mattress, that's a mattress."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Rory has the new mattress. That's the Yale-supplied mattress that has microbes in it that date back to Henry Box Brown."
"LUKE: Well, what are you gonna do with it?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was thinking maybe you could store it for me."
"LUKE: Uh, no."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Well, I can't take it back to Yale."
"LUKE: I'm not storing your microbe mattress, forget it."
"LORELAI: Well, then I'm stuck here."
"LUKE: Fine, because I need my truck back."
"LORELAI: Fine, but that leaves you with the mattress."
"LUKE: I'm not taking the mattress."
"LORELAI: Then let me take the truck."
"LUKE: But that means you take the mattress."
"LORELAI: I can't take the mattress."
"LUKE: Then you can't have the truck."
"LORELAI: But that sticks you with the mattress."
"LUKE: If you take the truck, it comes with the mattress."
"LORELAI: I can't take the mattress."
"LUKE: Then you can't have the truck."
"LORELAI: And that sticks you with the mattress."
"LUKE: We've been here before."
"LORELAI: I recognize that tree."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is in her bedroom unpacking. There's a knock at the door]"
"RORY: Come on in."
"[Tanna walks in]"
"TANNA: Um, another suitemate has arrived."
"RORY: Oh yeah?"
"TANNA: Yeah. She's a little weird. Um, I've already forgotten her name. I'm a disaster with names."
"RORY: That's okay."
"TANNA: It's the name of a city, like Athens or Rome or something."
"PARIS: [from the common room] I'm sure things can be rearranged. I mean, why not? It's a dorm, you're supposed to."
"TERRENCE: Let it go."
"[Rory and Tanna walk out to the common room]"
"RORY: Paris?"
"TANNA: Yeah, that's it."
"PARIS: How shocked are you?"
"RORY: Do you have a resuscitator?"
"PARIS: I'm going to Yale."
"RORY: You're going to Yale."
"PARIS: And we're suitemates."
"RORY: Of all the gin joints."
"PARIS: Give me a hug! Wait. Give me a hug!"
"RORY: This is a massively big surprise."
"PARIS: I was gonna call and then I thought, hey, let's wait and just be right in her face."
"RORY: I can't even feel my face anymore."
"PARIS: This is a good thing."
"RORY: No, yes, it's definitely a good thing. It's just, again, my nose. . .it feels like clay."
"PARIS: Oh, uh, this is Terrence."
"RORY: Hello."
"TERRENCE: It's nice to finally meet you, Rory."
"PARIS: Terrence is my life coach."
"RORY: Your what?"
"PARIS: Don't judge."
"RORY: I'm not."
"PARIS: Remember my nanny? I lost her over the summer."
"RORY: I'm sorry, what happened?"
"PARIS: She opened a pupuseria in Boise."
"RORY: So she's okay?"
"PARIS: Yeah, but I was pretty lost. Then my rabbi conferred with my therapist who said a hypnotist he knew thought a life coach would be right for me, and that led me to Terrence. He's here to assist me with whatever I need assistance in, from wardrobe to diet to finding me a kick-ass gynecologist."
"RORY: That's great, Paris, really."
"PARIS: He's done so much for my people k*ll. I can cope with the little annoyances now. [to Tanna] For instance, the old Paris would've been bothered by your penchant to hover. It would've made her wanna ring your neck until your eyeballs popped out."
"TANNA: Oh."
"PARIS: But now, I accept it because I can't control everything. Paris Gellar."
"RORY: That's Tanna."
"TANNA: In medieval times, surnames often reflected a person's origin or occupation so they were descriptive as well as utilitarian."
"PARIS: And what does Tanna mean?"
"TANNA: Nothing."
"PARIS: We're gonna have some fun this year."
"TANNA: Thank you."
"PARIS: How's your face?"
"RORY: Better, thanks."
"PARIS: Is that my room?"
"RORY: If your initials are P.G., it is."
"[Paris checks the room out]"
"PARIS: Terrence, I got my southern exposure."
"TERRENCE: I'm a happy camper."
"RORY: So, weird, weird coincidence that we're roommates like this, huh?"
"PARIS: Not really. I told Terrence all about our history and he felt very strongly that our life journey was not complete, so my dad made a call."

"CUT TO FRONT OF YALE"
"[Luke and Lorelai pull up in Luke's truck]"
"LORELAI: Luke, this was so nice of you, giving me a hand like this. It was above and beyond the call of duty."
"LUKE: Don't start this again."
"LORELAI: I'm not starting anything."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: I mean, if you just had stored the mattress. . ."
"LUKE: That's where we're not starting."
"LORELAI: What? It was your choice to come along."
"LUKE: I wanted the safe return of my truck without the mattress guaranteed. This was the only way."
"LORELAI: You know, I miss our friendship. We used to be so close. The summers at the lake. . ."
"LUKE: Let's just move along here, okay?"
"[Tess walks over to them]"
"TESS: Hi, there."
"LUKE: Hello."
"TESS: Is that your mattress?"
"LUKE: Well, uh, yeah."
"TESS: Hm. Tag has a Yale stamp."
"LUKE: Oh, well, when I said it was mine, it's not mine. It belongs in the dorm. We were just driving it around New Haven for awhile."
"TESS: Uh huh."
"LUKE: To air it out."
"TESS: Oh, okay."
"LUKE: We're gonna take it right back in."
"TESS: Great. [walks away]"
"LUKE: Thanks for jumping in."
"LORELAI: You seemed to have a handle on it."
"LUKE: What do we do now?"
"LORELAI: Unload. [walks away]"
"LUKE: With the mattress. What do we do with the mattress?"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory greets Lorelai at the door to her suite]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Saw you coming."
"LORELAI: What's up?"
"RORY: You just have to see it."
"[they walk inside]"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Paris?"
"RORY: And Terrence, her life coach."
"LORELAI: Like on Oprah?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Yes. They're setting up her crafts' corner."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Yes."
"PARIS: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Hi, Paris. It's so good to see you."
"PARIS: Same here. Terrence, this is Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi, Terrence."
"TERRENCE: Nice to meet you finally."
"LORELAI: Finally?"
"PARIS: You and I have a bit of a journey left to finish as well."
"LORELAI: I'll clear my schedule."
"PARIS: I was just setting up my craft corner. Some mosaic tiles, some colored beads. Still kind of kids' stuff, but Terrence showed me how working with my hands could help with my nerves."
"TANNA: Oh, where are we gonna put the couch?"
"PARIS: Why don't you just -"
"TERRENCE: Paris. . ."
"PARIS: Come on, Terrence."
"TERRENCE: Two steps forward, three steps back."
"PARIS: But she was baiting me."
"TERRENCE: Fish can choose not to bite."
"PARIS: We'll figure it out."
"[Luke comes to the door]"
"LUKE: This the place?"
"LORELAI: This is the place."
"[Luke starts pulling the mattress into the room]"
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, hold it a minute! You can't bring that thing in here."
"LUKE: Well, I'm not taking it back out. Hi, Rory."
"RORY: Hi, Luke."
"LORELAI: No, we're unloading bags and boxes first."
"LUKE: Look, that Tess already had her antennae up about the mattress and she wouldn't stop watching me, so I had to do something."
"LORELAI: Well, wait until she's gone and then bring it back out."
"LUKE: It's heavy. The only way I got it into the building is with help from Chip - his real name, believe it or not. Now I have to go help him unload his stuff because that was the deal."
"LORELAI: No, you don't. Blow him off. He's probably busy taping his Carmen Electra poster up on the ceiling above his bed."
"LUKE: The mattress stays. Now if you'll excuse me, Chip is waiting. [leaves]"
"PARIS: Oh no! My glue g*n leaked on my macaroni!"
"TERRENCE: Compartmentalize. . . and breathe."
"RORY: Let's get this thing out of the hallway."
"LORELAI: Hey, uh, I got a crisp Benjamin Franklin for anyone willing to disappear a mattress, no questions asked."
"RORY: Start pushing."
"LORELAI: Anyone? Two Benjamins? Hold on."
"CUT TO DORM HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the suite toward the exit doors]"
"LORELAI: Anything else you need, you'll write it down, okay?"
"RORY: I've got more than I need. Stuff I don't need."
"LORELAI: It's all necessary stuff."
"RORY: The disco ball?"
"LORELAI: You cannot host your much-anticipated Salute to Barry White Night without a disco ball."
"RORY: I forgot I was anticipating that. Where's Luke?"
"LORELAI: He's already out at the truck. So, this is it."
"RORY: This is really it."
"LORELAI: Learn a lot of stuff."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: You'll be a frequent visitor?"
"RORY: I'll be a frequent visitor."
"LORELAI: You can use the washer and the dryer."
"RORY: I don't need any inducement."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: But don't you get rid of that washer and dryer."
"LORELAI: I won't. Ciao, baby."
"RORY: Bye, Mom."
"[Lorelai leaves. Rory walks back into her room and sits on her bed]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Luke and Lorelai arrive back in town]"
"LUKE: So Chip is like, ""Set your side down first"" and I'm like, ""My side's the side with the leg missing. It's gonna collapse. You put your side down first"" and he's like, ""I'm losing my grip"", which was his excuse with everything we carried in - the TV, the stereo speakers. And I was like -"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, will you, like, get over this?"
"[Lorelai's pager goes off]"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: It's my pager. [checks it] Oh no."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: ""Come back."""
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's from Rory. It says ""Come back"" with about a dozen exclamation points. Uh, move, move."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I gotta borrow your truck."
"LUKE: No way."
"LORELAI: I gotta go back."
"LUKE: Well, then take your own car. Remember that concept?"
"LORELAI: No, it'll take too long to walk back to get it. Plus, I'm out of gas. Plus, it's been making weird noises and probably can't take a long trip. Please, Luke?"
"LUKE: I need my truck."
"LORELAI: I need it more."
"LUKE: You've had it all day."
"LORELAI: Don't you care about Rory?"
"LUKE: Of course I care about Rory. [sighs] Have it back by seven."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Luke."
"[Luke gets out of the truck and Lorelai slides over to the driver's side. She shifts the gear and the truck rolls back a little]"
"LORELAI: Ooh!"
"LUKE: That's reverse."
"LORELAI: I know. [she drives off]"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is sitting on her bed when Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Rory?"
"[Rory jumps up and hugs her]"
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, oh, honey, honey."
"RORY: Look at this, look at this."
"LORELAI: Look at what?"
"RORY: Four hours at Yale and I'm already homesick."
"LORELAI: Well, that's okay."
"RORY: All I could think of the minute you left was ""I want my mommy."" I haven't thought that since I was two."
"LORELAI: That's natural."
"RORY: I'm eighteen. I can sign contracts, I can vote, I can fight for my country. I mean, I'm an adult. Adults don't want their mommies."
"LORELAI: Yes, they do, honey. I'm not a good example, but -"
"RORY: Everything's so foreign. I have to share a bathroom. I've never shared a bathroom with anyone but you. So I'm gonna be running into people in the bathroom, we're gonna have to make small talk. I don't know any bathroom small talk."
"LORELAI: Um. . .gee, your hair smells terrific?"
"RORY: You didn't socialize me properly. You made me a mama's girl. Why don't I hate you? Why don't I want to be away from you? It's going to be very hard to be Christiane Amanpour broadcasting live from a foxhole in Tehran with my mommy. I guess you're just gonna have to learn how to operate a camera 'cause I'll need you there with me."
"LORELAI: I would do that."
"RORY: And how did I end up at Yale? I mean, I let Grandma and Grandpa manipulate me right out of Harvard and into Yale. That's how strong-willed I am. I know nothing about Yale."
"LORELAI: Not so - you've memorized its entire history."
"RORY: How can you be so fine with this? You left here without a care in the world."
"LORELAI: That's not true."
"RORY: You couldn't wait for me to get out of the house. What were you doing when I paged you - turning my room into a sewing room? I should hate you, not miss you. Do something to make me hate you."
"LORELAI: Uh. . .go h*tler!"
"RORY: Check this out."
"LORELAI: Your student ID?"
"RORY: I'm blinking and my head's in a funny place."
"LORELAI: No, it's not."
"RORY: I look like Keith Richards at Altamont. And check out the name."
"LORELAI: Ronny Gilmore. Oops."
"RORY: Yeah, oops. I don't even exist. And how did they get Ronny? That's not even remotely close to being short for any girl's name in the history of the entire planet."
"LORELAI: Well, Veronica, actually. . .sorry."
"RORY: Great, now I have you apologizing to me after I made you come back all this way just 'cause I'm a big fat stinkin' mama's girl. Mom! [hugs her]"
"LORELAI: I'm here."
"RORY: But you're not supposed to be."
"LORELAI: Where is it written?"
"RORY: Well, it's not exactly written, but it's clearly implied that the parents are supposed to leave the campus at some point."
"LORELAI: Yeah, at some point. So we choose the point."
"RORY: So can you stay for dinner?"
"LORELAI: I can stay all night."
"RORY: No, you can't do that."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"RORY: Because then I'm the pathetic person who needs her mother to stay all night and everyone here will see and know that."
"LORELAI: Okay, so I won't spend the night."
"RORY: No, stay the night. [hugs her]"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Lorelai walks into the common room carrying some takeout.]"
"LORELAI: I've got Balinese. Where does Bali go?"
"PARIS: We're still putting everything in geographic order. East to west."
"LORELAI: That's the system. Where is Bali?"
"RORY: Indonesia."
"PARIS: Is Indonesia east or west of the Philippines?"
"TANNA: East."
"RORY: No, west."
"LORELAI: Near Singapore? We've got Singapore here somewhere."
"TANNA: Find Sri Lanka, it's a bit over from that."
"LORELAI: But there's no Sri Lankan food."
"RORY: Just put it by Vietnam."
"PARIS: Is Vietnam east or west of the Philippines?"
"LORELAI: Ooh, boy, you guys really need to go to college."
"RORY: We ordered too much food."
"LORELAI: Hello, the point. We need a wide cross section for our local takeout test."
"TANNA: I still smell glue from your glue g*n."
"PARIS: You're rich, you know that?"
"LORELAI: What is this? You've eaten Indian food, yet I see nothing about Indian food on the chart."
"RORY: We'll get to it."
"LORELAI: The whole point of getting everything within delivery distance is so we can judge the quality of food, speed of service,"
"CUTeness of delivery guys on a scale of one to ten. We cannot work from memory on this."
"[the phone rings]"
"RORY: Where's the phone?"
"PARIS: Uh, under Mexico."
"LORELAI: I bet it's the pizza. Come help."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk outside to get the pizza delivery]"
"LORELAI: Hello, eight and a half."
"PIZZA GUY: I'm sorry?"
"RORY: Nothing. We just need to sign for the credit card?"
"PIZZA GUY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[they take the pizzas and walk back toward the suite]"
"RORY: We're four people and we ordered for like four hundred."
"LORELAI: So, what you're saying is you wanna crank it up? You wanna set it off? You wanna put a match to the keg and burn this mofo down?"
"RORY: I'm just saying it's a lot of food."
"LORELAI: Attention, Durfee girls!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Food and tons of it in suite five. Bring your appetites, bring your opinions, and, uh, hey, someone bring some music, but if it's Evanescence, you will be severely mocked. Enter, rejoice and come in."
"[Other girls from the floor start walking into the suite]"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Later that night, the suite is filled with girls. Lorelai walks out of the suite to get another food delivery]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, ice cream man."
"ICE CREAM MAN: Hey."
"LORELAI: Here you go."
"ICE CREAM MAN: Thanks. Have a nice night."
"LORELAI: You, too. Ooh, um, do me a favor? Count to ten before you leave."
"ICE CREAM MAN: Sure."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"[Lorelai walks back into the suite]"
"LORELAI: Hey, rate him, rate him!"
"[several girls rush to the window to see the delivery boy]"
"LORELAI: Hey, where does ice cream stand on our organizational system?"
"RORY: Our organizational system broke down about an hour ago."
"TANNA: Germany fell on China."
"LORELAI: Well, that's Germany for ya. Okay, we're out of Chinese completely, so we know Chinese is popular. Freddy's Happy Tokyo Takeout is a bust. That's the consensus, so let's lose the Freddy's menus, although Ang the delivery guy was a solid nine. If you're gonna go to Baja Bill's, you must get the cheese quesadilla, and ask for Stan or Tommy. If you don't get Stan or Tommy, go to Paco's Tacos. The delivery guys are butt ugly but the food is better. Look at all these girls together in one room having fun. We should dance and sing a Motown song into our hairbrushes. [walks away]"
"PARIS: So, do you like your adoptive parents?"
"TANNA: Yeah."
"PARIS: I think it's good to be adopted. If you get sick of them, you just dump this set and go find the originals."
"[a girl walks up to Rory]"
"GIRL: This is awesome."
"RORY: Thanks."
"GIRL: Who did all this?"
"RORY: The woman with the hairbrush."
"LORELAI: Uh, you guys, come on. I know it's cheesy but just a couple bars. . . You Can't Hurry Love? Someone's gotta do it, it doesn't have to be on key."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[That night, Rory and Paris are in their bedroom. Paris is on the phone]"
"PARIS: [on phone] It's lacking in storage space, but I've accepted it. It's a bit musty, but I've accepted it. Small. Small, but I've accepted it. Hey, listen, I should be going. Jamie, Terrence is not here, he's back in his room. Oh, right, me and Terrence, that's a possibility. I really gotta go, okay? I will. Good night. [hangs up]"
"RORY: Has he met Terrence?"
"PARIS: Nope, and he's not going to for as long as I can help it."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: I fixed your shower head."
"RORY: Really? But it was barely dribbling out."
"LORELAI: It just needed a twist. You've got a waterfall now."
"RORY: You're so handy."
"LORELAI: And my rates are reasonable."
"PARIS: My turn?"
"LORELAI: It's all yours."
"[Paris leaves]"
"RORY: No, Mom, you sleep on the new mattress."
"LORELAI: But it's yours."
"RORY: Well, they're both mine, so I get to choose. I'll sleep on the Yale mattress."
"LORELAI: But you have to break in your new mattress. If it molds to my body, your shorter body will be wallowing in the hollowness of my body."
"RORY: In one night?"
"LORELAI: It's the crucial night, that first night."
"RORY: Okay, but my offer still stands, so if you get the heebie-jeebies in the middle of the night over there, come join me."
"LORELAI: That'll get the girls talking. We'll be those dirty, filthy, almost-French Stars Hollow girls. [in French accent] Oh, we spit on you, you repressed puritanical ninnies."
"RORY: [in French accent] We smirk in your general direction."
"LORELAI: [in French accent] We cast sidelong glances that are vague but slightly threatening."
"RORY: [in French accent] We eschew your quaint double entendre for the appealing lasciviousness of the entendre singular."
"LORELAI: We. . .eh. . .I'm out."
"RORY: Me, too. Get the light."
"LORELAI: Did I tell you I found good coffee?"
"RORY: No, where?"
"LORELAI: The little kiosk by the library. I found it on the way to that parents thing."
"RORY: Cool."
"LORELAI: I'll circle it on the map for you."
"RORY: Good."
"[they hear a howling sound]"
"LORELAI: Is that some guy howling?"
"RORY: I don't know, sounded like it."
"[they hear another howl]"
"LORELAI: Sounds like the guys' floor had some fun tonight, too."
"RORY: I'd say so."
"[there's another howl; Lorelai responds with a howl]"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Well, if no one answers him, he may never stop."
"[several guys start howling]"
"LORELAI: Or it'll get a bunch of other guys howling, one or the other. [howls again]"
"RORY: Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: It's fun."
"[Rory howls]"
"RORY: It is fun."
"[they both howl]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[The next morning, Lorelai and Rory walk out of Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: So, what's first on the agenda today?"
"RORY: Well, I have a little time, so I thought I might walk around and get the lay of the land a little bit, and then I have my big freshman assembly."
"LORELAI: Where they teach you the secret Yale handshake?"
"RORY: Amongst other things."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, check out Paris' craft corner."
"RORY: She gets more done before nine than other people do all day."
"LORELAI: She's a craft person now, so it's not safe to leave anything around her anymore."
"RORY: Maybe that's where crafty comes from."
"LORELAI: Good point."
"[they walk out into the hallway]"
"LORELAI: All right, I should go. I called Luke last night and he made me promise to get the truck back by two hours ago, so if I leave now it's sooner than I planned."
"RORY: Thank Luke a lot for me, okay?"
"LORELAI: Okay, say goodbye to Paris and Tanna."
"RORY: Will do."
"LORELAI: So, this is really it."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: You good?"
"RORY: I'm good. Just keep your pager with you."
"LORELAI: Always."
"[they hug, Lorelai leaves]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LUKE: You're late."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"LUKE: It's okay. I told you to get it back three hours before I actually needed it back and it worked out perfectly."
"LORELAI: You rat."
"LUKE: So it's in park?"
"LORELAI: It's in park."
"LUKE: Engine's off?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Here are your keys. And thank you, Luke. I've been a huge burden on you the past couple days."
"LUKE: It's okay. [he looks out the window] I don't believe it."
"[They walk outside to the truck. The Yale mattress is in the back]"
"LUKE: It's like a horror movie."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: The mattress that would not leave my truck."
"LORELAI: I had no choice."
"LUKE: I may cry."
"LORELAI: Don't do that."
"LUKE: I don't want this mattress."
"LORELAI: Help me take it somewhere."
"LUKE: Where? To the conveniently located old mattress drop-off station right around the corner?"
"LORELAI: Or if you could store it for awhile. . ."
"LUKE: I wasn't kidding about the crying."
"LORELAI: I'll call a charity and have them come pick it up. I promise, and this time I mean it."
"LUKE: And where's my spare tire?"
"LORELAI: There was a spare tire?"
"LUKE: I had my spare tire back here."
"LORELAI: Oh, we must've accidentally unloaded it on one of our trips."
"LUKE: Could you try to get it back?"
"LORELAI: Yes, as long as Paris hasn't made it into a planter yet. Or I'll buy you a new one, I promise."
"LUKE: Okay, I'll see you later."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye. Oh, and, um, Rory says thanks for everything, too. She said specifically to tell you."
"LUKE: Okay, good. So she's okay?"
"LORELAI: She's fantastic."
"LUKE: Good."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[There's knock on Rory's suite door. She answers it; two girls are there]"
"GIRL 1: You're up?"
"RORY: I was up. Come on in."
"GIRL 1: We Lorelai'd a few places and found the good coffee."
"RORY: Lorelai'd?"
"GIRL 2: Checked places out."
"GIRL 1: Seems like the appropriate word. We found decent muffins, too, but I bet there's better out there."
"RORY: You'll Lorelai 'em another time."
"GIRL 1: [hands her a coffee] So this is thanks for last night. It was a perfect first night at Yale."
"RORY: I thought so."
"GIRL 2: We're gonna go to freshman assembly together. Do you wanna come?"
"RORY: Sure."
"GIRL 1: Then we're all going to conveniently lose our student ID's and go take new pictures."
"RORY: Oh my God, I'm so with you on that one."
"GIRL 1: Cool."
"RORY: [sips coffee] Mm. Whoa, this is really good. Kiosk by the library?"
"GIRL 1: Oh, you found it first."
"RORY: Kind of."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the empty house. She stands in the living room and looks around.]"

"OPEN IN LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is asleep in bed when her alarm goes off. She shuts it off, and a second later, several others start going off around her bedroom.]"
"LORELAI: You are hilarious!"
"[She gets up and walks down to the kitchen, where Luke is at the stove making breakfast]"
"LORELAI: Okay, see, last night, when I said to you, Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I get up at seven,' what I actually meant was, Tomorrow, no matter what, make sure I have the option of getting up at seven in case when seven comes, I actually wanna get up,' which  as it happened  I didn't. Therefore, you're currently responsible for the great alarm clock slaughter of 2002."
"[She pulls a container of coffee out of the freezer]"
"LUKE: No survivors?"
"LORELAI: The one shaped like a bunny escaped with a mild decapitation. [smells the coffee] This is decaf."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: You switched my coffee again."
"[Lorelai searches the kitchen for the regular coffee]"
"LUKE: I'm a busy man. I don't have time to sneak around switching your coffee. I have a diner to run, I have shipments to order, I have things to flip and fry. Will you stop that?"
"[Lorelai finds the bag of regular coffee under the sink]"
"LORELAI: Ha, haha, hahaha! Under the sink, very clever, but not clever enough bucko."
"LUKE: Okay, fine, you know what? I give up."
"LORELAI: Woo hoo!"
"LUKE: Go one day without coffee."
"LORELAI: That's not giving up."
"LUKE: I'll put a toy in your cereal."
"LORELAI: Dirty!"
"LUKE: [hands her a plate of food] Fine, here, you win."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: You're welcome. Now you're up, you're fed, I'm leaving."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, we need q-tips."
"LUKE: I'll alert the media."
"LORELAI: See, that's better with the accent."
"LUKE: The reference is enough, you'll learn that one day. I'll be home early, anything besides the q-tips?"
"LORELAI: Um, cotton balls, world peace, Connie Chung's original face back."
"[Luke kisses her]"
"LUKE: Goodbye crazy lady. [to Lorelai's stomach] Goodbye Sid and Nancy."
"LORELAI: Leopold and Loeb."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: I changed my mind, don't tell Rory."
"LUKE: Decaf."
"LORELAI: Never."
"LUKE: They'll both have two heads."
"LORELAI: More to love."
"[They kiss again and Luke walks out the back door]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[In the middle of the night, Lorelai wakes up suddenly from her dream. She falls out of the bed reaching for the phone]"
"LORELAI: Whoa! Ugh!"
"[She calls Rory at her dorm in Washington]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: You have to come home."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: You're gone and the house is quiet and Bill Maher's canceled. The name of the show was Politically Incorrect for God's sake. Didn't anybody read the title? He was supposed to say those things, dammit!"
"RORY: You had another dream."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: The doctor is in."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm lying in bed and I'm sleeping and I'm wearing this fabulous nightgown, and like thirty alarm clocks go off, and so I get out of bed and I walk downstairs, and there, standing is the kitchen, is Luke!"
"RORY: Was he naked?"
"LORELAI: No! He was making breakfast."
"RORY: Naked?"
"LORELAI: Okay, you've been in Washington way too long."
"RORY: Sorry. Go ahead, he was making breakfast. . ."
"LORELAI: Eggs and pancakes and bacon, and he put decaf coffee in my regular coffee bag, which of course I knew immediately."
"RORY: Hi, the nose."
"LORELAI: Exactly. So eventually I find the real stuff under the sink. He hands me my breakfast, and then . . ."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: He kissed me and talked to my stomach!"
"RORY: Why would he do that?"
"LORELAI: Because apparently I'm pregnant!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: With twins! [pause] Say something."
"RORY: You are going to be so fat."
"LORELAI: Just analyze my dream, please."
"RORY: Okay. Well, your dream was telling you that you are secretly in love with Luke and you wanna marry him and have his twins."
"LORELAI: Uh, no, try again."
"RORY: What do you mean, try again? You asked me to analyze your dream, I analyzed your dream."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I reject that analysis, so I'd like another one, please."
"RORY: You can't just reject an analysis and try again. You're not shopping for bathing suits here."
"LORELAI: Give me another analysis or I'll put your Taylor hula-hooping dream into a whole other context."
"RORY: I told you, Taylor was supposed to be Dean. I could tell by his freakishly thick head of hair."
"LORELAI: I'm waiting."
"RORY: Okay, maybe you're still upset about what happened with Dad and you're jealous of Sherry because she's having his baby and not you. Mom?"
"LORELAI: I miss you."
"RORY: I miss you, too."
"PARIS: [sleeptalking in background] Woodward. . .Bernstein. . .Harry Thomason."
"LORELAI: Is that Paris?"
"RORY: Yeah, she talks in her sleep. . . long in-depth arguments. I'm so glad I only have one more day here."
"LORELAI: Me, too. What do you have on your agenda for tomorrow? Or, today, actually."
"RORY: We have a breakfast mixer with members of Congress and the Senate."
"LORELAI: Cool. See if you can steal me something off of Tom Daschle's fruit plate."
"RORY: I'll see what I can do."
"LORELAI: See you Friday, doc."
"RORY: See you Friday."
"[Rory walks to her desk and sits down, where she tries to work on a letter to Jess]"
"PARIS: [sleeptalking] I did not have sexual relations with that woman."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at the kitchen table]"
"LORELAI: No way."
"SOOKIE: I swear."
"LORELAI: Huh, Kosher bacon."
"SOOKIE: Beef not pork."
"LORELAI: I am so Jewish."
"JACKSON: [from other room] Hey Sookie, where's my "
"SOOKIE: Jackson, hold on! Lorelai's here!"
"LORELAI: [covers eyes] Oh, Jackson, I'm in the kitchen! I'm eating bacon, so don't . . aye - eh - da - ahhh!"
"JACKSON: [walks into kitchen] Will you stop it? I'm dressed."
"LORELAI: Uh, well, how do I know you weren't showering and the hot water went out and you rushed down here with nothing but a teeny tiny towel in front of ya."
"JACKSON: Once, that happened once."
"LORELAI: Well, once was enough."
"SOOKIE: Oh, hey, honey, I got those paint chips that we were talking about. Do you wanna look at them now?"
"JACKSON: Nope."
"SOOKIE: But it'll only take a minute and I actually went though and picked out a couple of colors for you."
"LORELAI: What are you painting?"
"JACKSON: Nothing."
"SOOKIE: The house."
"LORELAI: The whole house?"
"JACKSON: No."
"SOOKIE: Just the inside."
"LORELAI: Ah, that's a pretty big undertaking."
"JACKSON: It's not such a big undertaking since we're not undertaking it."
"SOOKIE: I know, but it'll be fun."
"LORELAI: Rory and I'll help if you want."
"JACKSON: Okay, if you're gonna come over here everyday, you have to actually hear both of us."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, tell me why you're not painting just the inside of the house?"
"SOOKIE: Because it was my house and now it's our house and I want it to feel like our house."
"JACKSON: I'm totally happy with the way this house feels."
"SOOKIE: How can you be? There's flowers everywhere."
"JACKSON: I like flowers  I'm a produce guy."
"SOOKIE: The curtains are ruffly."
"JACKSON: I like ruffles."
"SOOKIE: How can you like ruffles?"
"JACKSON: Because I'm very, very gay."
"SOOKIE: Jackson!"
"JACKSON: Judy, Vincent has to go to work now. Goodbye Lorelai. Tell her I'm fine, I like things just the way they are."
"LORELAI: I'll try."
"[Jackson leaves]"
"LORELAI: All right, I've only got a minute and then I have to leave. Is there any more bacon?"
"SOOKIE: Have mine. What do you think about mahogany for the living room and then midnight blue for the hallway and the bedroom?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson just said he's fine with how everything is. I don't think it's bugging him."
"SOOKIE: Well, he may not think so now but it'll bug him eventually and then he'll resent this place and me by extension and I would like to avoid that. And I can  I just need to butch the place up a little. Now, help me pick a color."
"LORELAI: Okay, I can't now, but I'll do it later."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Thanks for breakfast, it was amazing, I love you, I love the bacon. Oh, hey, bacon's manly. Why don't you just nail a bunch of packages of Kosher bacon on the walls, huh? Smells like meat blessed by a rabbi  now that's a manly house."
"SOOKIE: Buh-bye."
"LORELAI: Okay, but if you're still thinking paint, you're still thinking like a chick."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[The town square is being set up for a festival. Lorelai walks toward Taylor, who is in an electric wheelchair giving orders to people.]"
"TAYLOR: Watch those streamers! And not too much red near that tree  light touch, light touch, light touch."
"LORELAI: Hey Taylor, how's the leg?"
"TAYLOR: It's just fine."
"LORELAI: Still haven't found out who put that banana peel on your doorstep, huh?"
"TAYLOR: No, but I have a list of suspects."
"LORELAI: Hey, um, what's all this for?"
"TAYLOR: This, young lady, is for the first annual Stars Hollow End of Summer Madness Festival."
"LORELAI: You finally found a way to fill September, didn't ya?"
"TAYLOR: This is gonna be a very exciting day. I'm really gonna go all out for this. I even think you'll be impressed."
"LORELAI: Really, even me?"
"TAYLOR: Yes-sir-ee, mini-me, I did not put the word madness in the title for nothing. This place is gonna be crazy, wild  food, games, we've even got a band coming all the way from New York!"
"LORELAI: New York  that's just nuts!"
"TAYLOR: And wait til you see the banner I ordered. It's gonna make every other banner we've ever had look downright embarrassing."
"LORELAI: Taylor, you're on fire."
"TAYLOR: Oh, I love this banner!"
"LORELAI: I can't wait to see it."
"TAYLOR: Well, come on Friday. [to girl walking by] Uh, excuse me, uh, young lady. . .young lady? You know I'm talking to you. The blonde woman with the ribbons, please slow down. I'm in a wheelchair, young lady, I can't run after you."
"[As Taylor follows the girl off camera, Lorelai stares into Luke's Diner then sadly walks away]"
"CUT TO WASHINGTON"
"[At the Junior Leadership breakfast, Paris is talking with Senator Barbara Boxer]"
"PARIS: I mean, come on, Senator Boxer, as one of our foremost Democratic leaders, I ask you  do you really think it looks good to have the American Secretary of the Treasury traveling around with Bono? I mean, I know apparently he's a saint, he's going to save the world, yada, yada, yada, but my God! He never even takes the sunglasses off. We have an image to maintain, don't we? I mean, aren't we at least trying to pretend we're the superpower in this world? I mean, why not just send Carson Daly over to the Middle East next time Cheney goes, huh? Or hey, hook up Freddie Prinze Jr. with Colin Powell next time he meets with NATO. I mean, hell! Let's hear what Freddie has to say, right?"
"[A man walks by and the Senator grabs his arm]"
"SENATOR BOXER: Oh, great, Doug. Uh, Paris, do you know Republican Congressman Doug Ose from California? You don't? Great. You two will have so much to talk about. Bye. [walks away]"
"CONGRESSMAN OSE: Uh, Barbara"
"PARIS: Ose, right?"
"CONGRESSMAN OSE: Yes that's right."
"PARIS: Let's take a walk."
"[cut to Rory at one of the food tables. As she gets herself some coffee, a boy walks up to her]"
"JAMIE: Last day here."
"RORY: Yup."
"JAMIE: So, in your opinion, how was our nation's capital?"
"RORY: Well, I got to see Archie Bunker's chair at the Smithsonian Museum, so it was a big thumbs up for me."
"JAMIE: Yes, there are times when this country's priorities are exactly right. So, where's Paris?"
"RORY: Hm, not quite sure. Last time I saw her, she was b*at the will to live out of our nation's representatives."
"JAMIE: She is a hammer, isn't she?"
"RORY: Actually, she's the entire toolbox."
"[Paris walks up to them]"
"PARIS: Damn. I always seem to catch the most interesting politicians right when they have to use the bathroom. Hey Jamie."
"[Paris walks over to another table and Jamie follows her]"
"JAMIE: Paris. Just came over to let you know I got a little sneak peak at the final debate pairings for today. It seems like you and I are going to be on the same side this time."
"PARIS: You're kidding? You'd think they'd like to give someone else a fighting chance for once."
"JAMIE: Apparently not."
"PARIS: God, I love this. You don't realize how unqualified most of America's youth is until you gather them all up in a room and make them speak. So, who are we up against?"
"JAMIE: Jason Roundsevault and Ty Fredericks."
"PARIS: Perfect. Jason's got asthma and Ty cries."
"JAMIE: Okay, so we should meet early and go over strategy, make sure you bought enough Kleenex."
"PARIS: Good, good."
"JAMIE: And then tonight we should get together and celebrate over dinner."
"PARIS: What if we don't win?"
"JAMIE: Don't lose it on me now."
"PARIS: You're right."
"JAMIE: So, dinner?"
"PARIS: Sure."
"JAMIE: Good, I'll swing around for you about seven."
"PARIS: Fine."
"JAMIE: Okay, see you at the slaughter."
"[Jamie walks away and Rory walks over to Paris]"
"RORY: Wow!"
"PARIS: Yeah, can you imagine pairing me with Jamie? I mean, why not just line the hallways with self esteem counselors right now."
"RORY: Paris?"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: What do you mean what? He just asked you out on a date."
"PARIS: He did not."
"RORY: Yes, he did. You're having dinner with Jamie tonight."
"PARIS: It's a victory dinner, that's it."
"RORY: Paris, if he just wanted to celebrate winning a debate, you guys could've had coffee afterward, but he asked you out on a date."
"PARIS: He did?"
"RORY: Yes."
"PARIS: Did I accept?"
"RORY: Yes."
"PARIS: I'm going on a date?"
"RORY: Yes, you are."
"PARIS: Oh man, I can't believe this! I finally get asked out on a date and I missed it? Was it a good ask-out?"
"RORY: It was a very good ask-out."
"PARIS: God, I wish I'd been there."
"RORY: Well, you'll be there tonight."
"PARIS: Tonight? Tonight I have a date. Tonight I have a date with Jamie  a Princeton man. I can overlook that. Oh my God, I can't believe it. . .I have a date."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel is at the front desk talking to Kirk]"
"KIRK: One day it occurred to me, cows never wrinkle."
"MICHEL: Mmhmm."
"KIRK: Think about it  have you ever seen a wrinkled cow? No, not once. So I thought to myself, ""That is weird."""
"MICHEL: Yes, that and other things."
"KIRK: So I decided to do a little research. I studied cows, I studied humans, and finally I discovered the secret  the secret of the cows."
"LORELAI: [walking up to them] Michel, could you, uh. . .hi Kirk."
"MICHEL: Oh, good, just in time. Kirk here is about to tell us the difference between cows and humans."
"LORELAI: You mean, other than one's a cow?"
"MICHEL: Shh. Go ahead, Kirk."
"KIRK: Hay."
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"KIRK: Hay, it's hay  cows eat hay. And after some experimentation and a great deal of research, I developed what I believe to be the next great skin care product to sweep the nation. [shows them a bottle]"
"LORELAI: [reads the label] Hay There."
"KIRK: A complete line of creams, balms, toning lotions, and cleansing liquids."
"LORELAI: Kirk, we already have a skin care line here, I'm sorry."
"KIRK: I am willing to give you three cases of ""Hay There"" skin products absolutely free of charge. Try them, you will see what I'm talking about."
"LORELAI: Well, uh, thank you very much, Kirk. . . but, I'm sorry  don't cows eat grass?"
"KIRK: Sometimes, but ""Grass There"" is a bad name. [leaves]"
"MICHEL: So sad not to have a cocktail in your hand every time he comes by, no?"
"[the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"EMILY: What day is this?"
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"EMILY: What day is this?"
"LORELAI: Mom, I have a group of "
"EMILY: It's Thursday."
"LORELAI: Thank God. Now, could I possibly "
"EMILY: Thursday the what, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: It's "
"EMILY: Thursday the third. And what was happening Thursday the third, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: I believe it was the day I was supposed to chew my own head off."
"EMILY: Your father and I were coming home from Martha's Vineyard."
"LORELAI: I know you were."
"EMILY: And you said that when we got home, you were going to call us."
"LORELAI: I know I did."
"EMILY: Well, we're home, and yet there's no call, no message, no card."
"LORELAI: Mom, it's eleven o'clock in the morning. I said I would call you on Thursday, I didn't say when on Thursday, I just said Thursday. Technically I haven't screwed up for another twelve hours."
"EMILY: Lorelai, everyone knows that you are supposed to call people as soon as they have arrived home. That's the polite way to do it."
"LORELAI: You didn't tell me what time you were coming home."
"EMILY: Well, you never asked what time we were coming home."
"LORELAI: Yes, but you never told me so there's no way I could know, so even though I didn't ask I still didn't know and it's only elev. . .I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Apology accepted. Now I assume we'll be seeing you and Rory for dinner tomorrow?"
"LORELAI: Uh, you'll see me but Rory doesn't get back til Saturday."
"EMILY: Oh, what a shame. I thought she was coming back tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Nope, she's coming back Saturday."
"EMILY: Well, I'm very disappointed. I had it written down for tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Well, you must've written it down wrong, Mom. She's coming home Saturday."
"EMILY: Your father thought it was tomorrow, also."
"LORELAI: See you at seven."
"EMILY: Hold a moment, Lorelai. Do you know where Christopher is?"
"LORELAI: Um, why?"
"EMILY: We wanted him to come with you and Rory tomorrow, even though apparently Rory's getting back Saturday, though I couldn't sworn it was tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Christopher's away on business but I'll tell him you invited him."
"EMILY: And tell him to come with you two next week. I wanna see the three of you together."
"LORELAI: Yes, that would be a nice picture."
"EMILY: All right, see you tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Yes, you will. Bye."
"CUT TO WASHINGTON DORM ROOM"
"[Rory is on the phone with Dean while Paris gets ready for her date]"
"RORY: My plane gets in at three."
"DEAN: I'm in at six."
"PARIS: Red, purple, green  where the hell is it?"
"RORY: That gives me three hours to look presentable. Hm, perhaps I'll go blonde."
"DEAN: I strongly request that you don't."
"RORY: Afraid of change?"
"DEAN: No, I just like what I have."
"RORY: I like a man who settles."
"DEAN: I miss you."
"RORY: I miss you, too."
"PARIS: Hey, hey, stop being cute. I need help here."
"RORY: I have to go. Paris is melting down."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: She has a date tonight."
"DEAN: Really?"
"PARIS: Don't sound so surprised."
"RORY: How do you know he sounded surprised?"
"PARIS: Because I'm a genius, Rory. I have deep and powerful clairvoyant abilities."
"RORY: Oh boy."
"PARIS: For example, I can instantly deduce that when someone hears the name Paris in the same sentence with the word date, jaws will drop, confused looks will cover faces, words like how' and why' and Quick, Bob, get the children in the minivan because the world is obviously coming to an end!' will immediately fly out of people's mouths."
"RORY: I have to go."
"DEAN: Are you sure it's safe?"
"RORY: I'll be fine. I'll see you Friday."
"DEAN: See you Friday. I love you."
"PARIS: That's it, I'm shaving my head."
"RORY: Gotta go. [hangs up] Okay, Paris, you have got to calm down."
"PARIS: I had a black sweater and now it's gone."
"RORY: I'm not just talking about right now  in general, you need to calm down."
"PARIS: He's almost here, I'm not dressed, my makeup's not done, and I haven't gone through the Zagat yet to pick out a restaurant."
"RORY: Why don't you just let him pick out the restaurant?"
"PARIS: What if he doesn't have a Zagat?"
"RORY: Well, then he'll wing it."
"PARIS: Wing it? How come other girls get planned out dinners? Flowers, candy, rose petals thrown on the floors  and I get wing it?"
"RORY: Well, you don't know that you've got wing it."
"PARIS: No, I do. I've got wing it. I can't do this."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Date. I can't date. I'm not genetically set up for it."
"RORY: Not true."
"PARIS: I get no pleasure out of the prospect or the preparation. I'm covered in hives, I've showered four times, and for what? Some guy who doesn't even have the brains to buy a Zagat so we don't wind up in a restaurant that's really just a front for a cocaine laundering ring?"
"RORY: Sit."
"PARIS: It's a dare. He was dared to take me out. I bet Trent Lott was behind this."
"RORY: Trent Lott did not dare Jamie to take you out. Close. Jamie likes you and he asked you out because he likes you. Now look up."
"PARIS: Maybe I shouldn't go. I mean, what if I fall for him and he doesn't like me?"
"RORY: Then you'll find someone else."
"PARIS: But what if there is no one else?"
"RORY: Then you'll buy some cats."
"PARIS: I wish I knew if he was right for me, you know? So I don't put myself through all of this for nothing. I mean, women fall for men who are wrong for them all of the time, and then they get sidetracked from their goals. They give up careers and become alcoholics and, if you're Sunny von Bülow, wind up in a coma completely incapable of stopping Glenn Close from playing you in a movie."
"RORY: I think you should wear your hair down."
"PARIS: How do you know if a guy is right for you?"
"RORY: You just have to feel it."
"PARIS: All I feel is my back breaking out."
"RORY: You'll know, okay? You just have to let it happen. And then, probably when you're not looking, you'll find someone who compliments you."
"PARIS: Meaning?"
"RORY: Someone who likes what you like, someone who reads the same books or listens to the same music or likes to trash the same movies. Someone compatible."
"PARIS: Okay."
"RORY: But not so compatible that they're boring."
"PARIS: Someone who's compatible but not compatible."
"RORY: Yeah, kind of. I mean, you respect each other's opinions and you can laugh at the same jokes, but I don't know  there's just something about not quite knowing what the other person's gonna do at all times that's just really exciting. Look, just have a good time, you'll figure it out."
"PARIS: Yeah, well, I hope I figure it out fast. . .before I throw up."
"[there's a knock at the door]"
"PARIS: That's him."
"RORY: Turn around."
"PARIS: Well?"
"RORY: Perfect."
"PARIS: Promise?"
"RORY: Swear."
"PARIS: Thanks. Now get in the closet."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: If he comes in here and sees you, he won't wanna date me anymore."
"RORY: Paris, that's crazy! He's seen me  he's seen me for weeks."
"PARIS: Yes, in conferences, crowded lecture halls, badly lit banquet rooms with crappy food smells, not at night when it's dating time and he's thinking about dating and you're standing there looking all datable."
"RORY: I'm not looking datable."
"PARIS: Please? I can't risk it. At least if there's nothing to compare me to, then I've got a fighting chance, please!"
"RORY: Okay, but when you get home, you need to get a new therapist because the one you have is really not working. [goes into the closet]"
"PARIS: Thanks for helping me get ready."
"RORY: [from inside closet] Any time."
"[Paris answers the door]"
"PARIS: Hi."
"JAMIE: Hello. You look very nice."
"PARIS: Well, this is a really good sweater."
"JAMIE: So, shall we get going?"
"PARIS: Oh, sure, sure."
"JAMIE: Do you like Italian food?"
"PARIS: I love Italian food."
"JAMIE: Good. I've made a reservation at a great place. Well, at least, that's what the Zagat guide says."
"PARIS: You're perfect."
"JAMIE: Let's go."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are browsing]"
"SOOKIE: How could you not tell them?"
"LORELAI: Well, they left two days after your wedding and they were in Martha's Vineyard all summer. It just seemed quieter."
"SOOKIE: What do you think, manly? [holds up a statue]"
"LORELAI: In an Oscar Wilde sort of way, absolutely."
"SOOKIE: You know, you're gonna have to tell them tonight, right? I mean, the subject will come up. They probably think you and Christopher are heading down the aisle any day now."
"LORELAI: Ugh, I know, I know."
"SOOKIE: A shaving table, it's perfect!"
"LORELAI: And twelve hundred dollars."
"SOOKIE: Twelve hundred dollars for what?"
"MRS. KIM: What do you mean, for what? This is an antique."
"SOOKIE: Where does she come from?"
"MRS. KIM: This was Sherman's shaving table."
"LORELAI: Sherman?"
"MRS. KIM: General Sherman, famous man, b*rned Atlanta, liked a close shave."
"LORELAI: Wow, historical."
"MRS. KIM: All original, perfect shape. I give you ten percent off, you want it?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, well, maybe. I just wanted to look around a little bit first. . .but it's very nice."
"MRS. KIM: I know it's very nice. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Boy, she would've made a great nun."
"SOOKIE: So how are you planning on telling them?"
"LORELAI: I thought I'd do it like Nell. You know, chicka chicka chickabee."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, that's a very good idea."
"LORELAI: I'll tell them, I promise."
"SOOKIE: Oh, oh my God, look! [walks over to a fish mounted on a piece of wood]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: For over the mantelpiece. It's perfect!"
"LORELAI: It's a dead fish."
"SOOKIE: It's an antique stuffed and mounted trout, and I think it's manly."
"LORELAI: Oh, please!"
"SOOKIE: It is! It's very Ralph Lauren."
"LORELAI: Sookie, Jackson loves you. You're not seriously telling me the future of your marriage depends on Leon Troutsky over there."
"SOOKIE: I guess not."
"LORELAI: Just think about it, okay? You don't have to make every decision right now. Do a little more shopping. Maybe you'll find something even more disgusting someplace else."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay, I gotta go pick up Rory at the airport, and then we'll swing by and pick up you guys for the festival."
"SOOKIE: Great."
"LORELAI: Okay, see you later."
"SOOKIE: Bye."
"[Lorelai walks toward the door and stops to talk to Mrs. Kim.]"
"LORELAI: Ten bucks if you don't let her buy the fish."
"MRS. KIM: Twenty."
"LORELAI: [laughs] You're kidding?"
"MRS. KIM: I never kid."
"LORELAI: You know, I believe that."
"CUT TO AIRPORT"
"[Rory walks out of her gate; Lorelai calls to her from across the room]"
"LORELAI: Hey Gilmore!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"[They run to each other and hug, then fall on the ground]"
"LORELAI: Ow, ow!"
"RORY: Ah!"
"LORELAI: Ow!"
"RORY: Ah!"
"LORELAI: Oh!"
"RORY: Agh!"
"LORELAI: Oh, oh! Luckily there are video cameras everywhere that caught that very graceful moment on tape."
"RORY: I am so glad to see you!"
"LORELAI: No, I'm glad to see you!"
"RORY: I'm never leaving home again."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's my emotionally stunted girl! Hey, I got you gifts."
"RORY: What? I'm the one that left town, I'm supposed to get you gifts."
"LORELAI: Oh, but I got here early and there was nothing to do except feed gummy bears to the b*mb dogs which, apparently, the United States government frowns upon."
"RORY: You got in trouble with the government while you were waiting for me?"
"LORELAI: Just a little."
"RORY: How much is a little?"
"LORELAI: Learn Russian. Okay, here you go. [pulls a shirt out of the gift bag]"
"RORY: Wow, a Hartford, Connecticut sweatshirt."
"LORELAI: Nice, huh?"
"RORY: [looks through the gift bags] Hartford, Connecticut notebook, Hartford, Connecticut pencil set, a Hartford, Connecticut sh*t glass."
"LORELAI: And beer mug!"
"RORY: Hartford baguette, Hartford bear, a Hartford sunglasses."
"LORELAI: You like?"
"RORY: I love."
"LORELAI: All right, let's go. We'll get your bags, then we'll hit the road, and I can't wait to hear all about Washington. And, by the way, I got you out of dinner with the Gilmores tonight. I thought you and Dean might enjoy a little Peaches and Herb time together."
"RORY: Oh, thanks. What'd you tell them?"
"LORELAI: That you get home tomorrow."
"RORY: Big fat lie."
"LORELAI: Yes, which proves how much I love you. The fact that I was willing to lie to my own parents who I never lie to just so you could have a night of happiness is proof positive of my deep undying devotion that I have for you."
"RORY: I appreciate that."
"LORELAI: And all that devotion can be yours for the low, low price of $29.95!"
"RORY: Forget it."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll throw in a set of steak knives."
"RORY: My bags, please?"
"LORELAI: Are you telling me that you want this gesture of love for free? What kind of world are you living in?"
""

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door with Rory's bags]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, you do know one option was leaving some of your books at home?"
"RORY: Hey, I offered to carry that one."
"LORELAI: Next time, don't offer  insist. Look, I'm lopsided now."
"RORY: I can't believe I'm home. I feel like I've been away forever."
"LORELAI: I agree."
"RORY: Hello living room."
"LORELAI: Hello Rory, we missed you. Not the ottoman, of course, but everyone knows he's a snob. Napoleon complex, he only really likes the magazine rack."
"RORY: Oh my God, I missed everything. My kitchen, my room, my books, my CDs, my stuff. Where's my pillow?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: You took my pillow."
"LORELAI: I did not take your pillow."
"RORY: You waited until I left, you went into my room, and you took my pillow."
"LORELAI: Well, you weren't using it."
"RORY: What else did you take?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. Your comforter came into my room by itself. . .and brought your Bauhaus T-shirt with it."
"RORY: I want my stuff back by tomorrow morning."
"LORELAI: Just cause you leave doesn't mean the world stops."
"RORY: By noon."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"[Lorelai pushes the play button on the answering machine]"
"CHRISTOPHER: [on machine] Lor, it's me, please just call "
"[Lorelai deletes the message]"
"RORY: Dad?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Still haven't talked to him yet, huh?"
"LORELAI: No, you?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: He's called."
"RORY: I know. He's called me, too."
"LORELAI: I just. . .I don't really know what to say."
"RORY: How long are you gonna freeze him out for?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: You?"
"RORY: I don't know either."
"LORELAI: I have to tell my parents tonight."
"RORY: Are you sure you don't want me to go with you and . . . I don't know, distract them?"
"LORELAI: No, you've got Dean coming over. I'll be fine. I'll bring them something shiny."
"RORY: Okay, I'm gonna go change then."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RORY: The festival."
"LORELAI: Hon, you know what, if you don't wanna go, we don't have to go."
"RORY: Why would I not wanna go? Of course I wanna go."
"LORELAI: You just got home, you've got Dean coming over."
"RORY: No, I wanna go. I wanna go because this is our town and we need to support these things."
"LORELAI: All right, but. . .you don't have to change for that."
"RORY: Well, I've been away for awhile, I wanna make a nice impression."
"LORELAI: On who?"
"RORY: Whoever has to look at me."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: All right, just hustle. I promised Jackson and Sookie I'd pick them up along the way."
"RORY: I'll just be a minute."
"LORELAI: No woman is ever a minute when she changes."
"RORY: Do not judge me by your own standards. [pulls out a dress]"
"LORELAI: Wow, fancy."
"RORY: Not fancy."
"LORELAI: You know, you'll have time to come home and change for Dean."
"RORY: Well, I can just change now, then I won't have to do it later."
"LORELAI: Okay. Hey Rory, I don't want you to freeze out your dad because I am."
"RORY: I'm not."
"LORELAI: Cause I'm fine if you wanna go back to the way things were."
"RORY: I think that would be a little hard this time."
"LORELAI: Okay, maybe not now, but eventually."
"RORY: Eventually, maybe, but for now  solidarity sister."
"LORELAI: Ya ya!"
"RORY: You've been waiting for six weeks to do that, haven't you?"
"LORELAI: Ya ya!"
"RORY: I'll just be a minute."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of some bushes near Sookie and Jackson's house]"
"LORELAI: See, three minutes faster. I also found a way to get to Al's Pancake World that shaves a good forty seconds off our normal route."
"RORY: You were really bored when I was gone, weren't you?"
"LORELAI: You have no idea."
"[As they walk up Sookie and Jackson's front steps, they hear yelling from inside]"
"JACKSON: Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?"
"SOOKIE: I don't understand why you're so upset."
"JACKSON: How can you not understand? I told you a thousand times."
"SOOKIE: I thought you were just being nice."
"[Lorelai and Rory peek through the front door. Sookie has redecorated the living room and filled it with masculine objects]"
"JACKSON: Nice! Sookie, look at this place!"
"SOOKIE: I think it looks nice."
"JACKSON: Nice. . .nice? This is nice. . .this is nice? [points to a life-sized stuffed grizzly bear]"
"SOOKIE: Well, it's masculine!"
"JACKSON: No, it's terrifying! I swear I'm gonna come out in the middle of the night for a drink of water, turn around, hit the floor and play dead!"
"SOOKIE: Okay, so, we have a little work to do."
"JACKSON: Just put it back the way it was."
"SOOKIE: No, I want you to be happy!"
"JACKSON: I was happy, I told you I was happy, you just didn't wanna believe I was happy!"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk away from the house and walk toward the festival]"
"LORELAI: We'll just check on them a little later."
"RORY: Excellent idea."
"[they walk into the crowd]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so, do we do cheese stick, hot dog, cotton candy, or do we mix it up a little  start with the cotton candy and end with the cheese stick? Who are you looking for?"
"RORY: No one, I'm just taking in all the madness, that's all."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"[Kirk walks up to them]"
"KIRK: Lorelai, good. Have you used the cream yet?"
"LORELAI: Uh, not yet, Kirk."
"KIRK: Good, there's been a little problem."
"LORELAI: What kind of problem?"
"KIRK: Nothing of major concern. It just seems that with continual use, the cream develops some weird reactions to light. . .and air. . .and movement."
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"KIRK: Don't worry, it's just a small kink. It'll all be worked out soon."
"LORELAI: I have three cases of that stuff sitting at the inn."
"KIRK: Well, get rid of it."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: Uh, but don't throw it in the trash. Apparently, that would be an EPA violation."
"LORELAI: What am I supposed to do with the stuff?"
"KIRK: sh**ting it into space is about all I've got now."
"LORELAI: Kirk!"
"KIRK: I'll pick up the cases tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Kirk walks away]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Do you sometimes think this town is weird or is it just me?"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to Taylor]"
"LORELAI: Hey Taylor, is this where the mosh pit starts?"
"TAYLOR: Well, hello Lorelai, Rory. So what do you think of the band? Pretty big city, don't you think?"
"LORELAI: Mm, I sure do."
"TAYLOR: What?"
"LORELAI: What? I'm agreeing with you. They are smokin'!"
"TAYLOR: I do not care for that sarcastic tone, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well. . .uh. . .no, I'm being nice here!"
"TAYLOR: You have an opinion on everything. Nothing is ever up to your standards."
"LORELAI: That is not true. I'm sure these guys are all great barbers."
"TAYLOR: I don't even know why I bother. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: That is it  I have been it for the last. . .[sees Rory staring off at something] What? [sees Jess and a girl kissing against a tree] Oh, well, looks like he's got his what I did this summer' essay all researched and ready to go. Guess you dodged a b*llet there, huh?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It seems kind of lucky that you didn't throw everything away for Jess when you see. . ."
"RORY: See what? What am I seeing?"
"LORELAI: You're upset."
"RORY: No, I'm not upset."
"LORELAI: Yes, you are upset. I know when you're upset cause you look like my mother."
"RORY: Thanks a lot."
"LORELAI: You like my mother."
"RORY: Yes, but you don't like your mother, so when you tell me that I look like your mother, it's not exactly a compliment."
"LORELAI: Honey, what is wrong?"
"RORY: Oh God!"
"LORELAI: What is it?"
"RORY: It's that!"
"LORELAI: Jess?"
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: You're upset about Jess?"
"RORY: I said yes."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's Jess?"
"RORY: You're not being funny."
"LORELAI: It's not my fault that yes and Jess rhyme. Did I exploit the opportunity, of course I did, but . . .Rory, come on. I know you had this crush "
"RORY: It wasn't a crush."
"LORELAI: Well, I thought it was over. I mean, you haven't talked to him since "
"RORY: Sookie's wedding."
"LORELAI: You talked to him at Sookie's wedding?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: He wasn't at Sookie's wedding."
"RORY: Yes, he was. He had just come back and he came to see me."
"LORELAI: Okay, so he crashed Sookie's wedding, and. . ."
"RORY: And nothing. He told me that he was back in town, that he'd moved back, and. . ."
"LORELAI: What Rory? Come on."
"RORY: And we kissed, okay?"
"LORELAI: You kissed?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: You kissed, like. . .you kissed?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Okay, who kissed who?"
"RORY: What does that matter?"
"LORELAI: Because it matters. Did he kiss you, did you kiss each other, did you trip and your faces accidentally  ."
"RORY: I kissed him."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: And I don't know, I thought he came back here because he liked me or something, and I kissed him and he kissed me back, and now he's over there and I feel so stupid and. . .that girl isn't even his type and -"
"LORELAI: Rory, what are you doing?"
"RORY: What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm ranting. You should recognize this, I learned it from you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but you went to Sookie's wedding with. . .with Dean."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: And then you ran off to have some thing with Jess."
"RORY: It was a kiss, not a thing."
"LORELAI: A kiss is a thing."
"RORY: Well, it wasn't planned, it just happened."
"LORELAI: I can't believe it. All this time I'm thinking, She's with Dean.'"
"RORY: I am with Dean."
"LORELAI: No, Rory  kissing another guy is not being with Dean. Ask him, I bet he'd back me up on that."
"RORY: It was nothing."
"LORELAI: Well, then why are you so freaked out?"
"RORY: I'm not freaked out."
"LORELAI: Look, kid, you have gotta make up your mind. Jess, Dean, Jess, Dean  it's enough already. If you want Jess, that's fine  go get him, there he is. If you think that's the great love of your life, then great. . .grab a liver treat and a squeaky toy and run to him. Don't worry about that girl because I'm sure he will have moved onto somebody else in about an hour. But do something. Dean has been sweet and supportive and incredibly patient, and now you are officially treating him like dirt, and I'm sorry, but not only is that not you, he doesn't deserve that. God, I wish they knew another song!"
"RORY: I know all of this about Dean."
"LORELAI: You do?"
"RORY: Yes, I do. I know how great he is. I knew it before you did!"
"LORELAI: Well, knowing this has apparently not stopped you from dragging his heart all over this town."
"RORY: Not fair!"
"LORELAI: Yes, fair, the fairest, the Snow White of fair."
"RORY: I don't wanna talk to you about this anymore."
"LORELAI: Okay, listen, if you don't wanna be with Dean anymore, cut him loose. Let him find someone who does because this is just so. . .wrong!"
"RORY: All right, I get it, I . . .just stop!"
"DEAN: [calls from across the street] Rory! [walks over to them] Hey."
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi Dean."
"RORY: I thought your plane didn't get in til six."
"DEAN: Well, I managed to get an earlier flight."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm off to dinner with the parents."
"DEAN: Do you have "
"LORELAI: No, she's off the hook. You guys have all night to. . .talk. Enjoy. Good to have you back, Dean."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"LORELAI: See you later. [leaves]"
"DEAN: So, did I interrupt something?"
"RORY: No, nothing. Uh, we were just. . .hi, you're back."
"DEAN: Yeah, I'm back  and I'm glad to find you not blonde."
"RORY: Yeah, I was just having way too much fun, so . . ."
"DEAN: I missed you."
"RORY: I missed you, too."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings; Emily answers the door]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, nice to see you."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry I'm late, Mom."
"EMILY: No, don't be sorry. That's what the warm setting was invented for. Richard, Lorelai's here!"
"LORELAI: Um, Mom, before we get the evening started and all, I wanna tell you something."
"EMILY: Well, tell me outside."
"LORELAI: No, I'll just do it here."
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Oh, there's just something about standing near the exit that's really working for me."
"EMILY: You're being silly, you don't discuss things standing by a door. Come outside, come on."
"RICHARD: I may have to take one more call tonight, Emily. Ben Stellen and I got cut off. Hello Lorelai."
"EMILY: Well, come outside with us until he calls back. Lorelai's about to tell us something."
"RICHARD: Oh, perhaps that she's decided to buy an accurate timepiece."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard. [they start walking to the back patio] Is Rory okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, Rory's fine, I'm fine, everything's fine, it's really not that big a deal."
"RICHARD: What would you like to drink?"
"LORELAI: Oh, whatever."
"RICHARD: I can't read minds, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I really don't care, Dad. Whatever you have."
"RICHARD: We have everything, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Al right, I'll have a Yaegermeister and a Jell-O sh*t."
"RICHARD: Uh, excuse me?"
"LORELAI: White wine."
"EMILY: All right, sit, sit. [they sit down] Now go ahead, tell us."
"LORELAI: Okay, well "
"EMILY: Oh, wait just a second. We brought you something from Martha's Vineyard."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's great, but maybe we could just do. . . [Emily hands her a gift bag]. . .okay, I guess it's present time."
"EMILY: Open it."
"[pulls something out of the bag]"
"LORELAI: Scone mix, wow."
"EMILY: This new little place opened right down the road from our house and they make these wonderful scones, and that is their mix so you can make them right in your own kitchen."
"LORELAI: Well, thanks, Mom. I will put this right on the counter and stare at it for many years to come."
"EMILY: You're not going to make them?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm not really much of a baker."
"EMILY: But the instructions are right there on the back."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but still."
"EMILY: Still what? Those are good scones."
"LORELAI: Hey, maybe I'll give this to Sookie and she'll bake them."
"EMILY: I don't understand why you simply can't follow those directions and make the scones."
"RICHARD: Rory would love those scones."
"LORELAI: Okay, I promise one way or another, the scones will get eaten. That being said, can we please move on?"
"EMILY: Fine, go ahead, talk, we're listening."
"LORELAI: Um, okay, well, um, it's about Christopher."
"EMILY: Oh, that reminds me, we got him a captain's hat. Richard, where is that hat? Lorelai can bring it to him."
"LORELAI: No, I can't!"
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's just, um. . .Chris and I aren't . . ."
"RICHARD: Aren't what?"
"EMILY: They aren't together anymore, Richard."
"RICHARD: Why not?"
"EMILY: I'm sure a vague reason is forthcoming."
"LORELAI: It just didn't work out, that's all."
"EMILY: And there it is."
"LORELAI: I know you're disappointed."
"EMILY: Disappointed, oh please! Lorelai, this is ridiculous. The two of you aren't in high school anymore."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RICHARD: Emily, let's not talk about this."
"EMILY: No, we are going to talk about it. You're running around like you have no responsibility in life, like you can flit from thing to thing. . ."
"LORELAI: That's not true."
"EMILY:. . .from man to man."
"LORELAI: I don't flit from man to man."
"EMILY: You have a daughter, this affects Rory too, you know!"
"RICHARD: Emily, you're wasting your breath."
"LORELAI: I know this affects Rory. I'm not doing this lightly. In fact, I'm not doing anything at all."
"RICHARD: There's no reason to raise your voice."
"LORELAI: I can't believe this."
"EMILY: I wanna know why. I want a reason. I don't want any of this just because' and it just didn't work out' nonsense. I want a solid, adult reason why the father of my granddaughter and her mother can't seem to put a family together."
"LORELAI: His girlfriend is pregnant."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Sherry is pregnant, and when Christopher found out, he went back to her and that, Mother, is the reason."
"EMILY: Are they getting married?"
"LORELAI: I don't know  probably."
"RICHARD: Oh, of course they're getting married."
"EMILY: How do you know?"
"RICHARD: I know because I know Christopher, and Christopher always tries to do the right thing."
"EMILY: The right thing is for him to be with his family. Lorelai and Rory are his family. He met this woman two minutes ago."
"RICHARD: Emily, he is going to be a father."
"EMILY: He already is a father!"
"LORELAI: I really really don't wanna discuss this anymore."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you have to talk to him."
"LORELAI: There's nothing to talk about."
"EMILY: Tell him you wanna get married."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom, please stop."
"RICHARD: Yes, Emily, please stop. You know that Lorelai never does anything unless she wants to  no matter the consequences to anyone else."
"LORELAI: What's that supposed to mean?"
"EMILY: Lorelai wants to be with Christopher, she told us that at the wedding."
"RICHARD: Yes, and now the wind has changed."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RICHARD: Christopher is living up to his responsibilities as he tried to do many years ago with Lorelai, then she turned him down and turned him away."
"LORELAI: I was sixteen."
"RICHARD: If Christopher has found someone who will actually allow him to be a father to his own child, then of course, that's what he's going to do."
"EMILY: So you support this?"
"RICHARD: I understand this."
"EMILY: I am appalled by your attitude."
"RICHARD: And I am shocked by your naïveté. Did you really expect this to work out? Did you really have pictures of Norman Rockwell family Christmases dancing in your head? Lorelai had her chance for a family, she walked away from it. That was her choice. He has a chance to be a father. I applaud him."
"EMILY: Then you're an idiot."
"RICHARD: If you'll excuse me, I'm going into my study."
"EMILY: Richard! You do not walk out on me when we are having a discussion. Richard!"
"[While Emily and Richard are arguing, Lorelai walks into the house and leaves through the front door]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai pulls up in the town square. She looks around, then walks into Luke's Diner. Luke is standing at the cash register.]"
"LUKE: We're closed."
"LORELAI: I know. Look, I didn't come here to make up, or to try to get you to forgive me, or talk. I wouldn't even have come here at all but I had a really crappy night and I really, really need a cup of coffee. Just pretend I'm not me. I'm Mimi, a new customer. I've never been in here before. I was just walking down the street and I spotted this place. Ooh, hey, nice place.' And I came in. Now Mimi is going to pour herself a cup of coffee and sit over here way far away from you, and she promises, just as soon as she's done, she will rinse out her own cup and leave."
"[Lorelai pours herself a cup of coffee and sits at the end of the counter.]"
"LORELAI: This is the second time I let myself do this."
"LUKE: Do what?"
"LORELAI: Think I finally found it."
"LUKE: Found what?"
"LORELAI: Love, comfort, safety."
"LUKE: Ah."
"LORELAI: I mean, first with Max, which of course, I screwed up, and then with Christopher, which of course, all the elements of the universe got together to screw up."
"LUKE: Yup, it's tough when the universe is against you. That's like taking on the Manhattan garbage union."
"LORELAI: I always thought if he could just get it together, grow up  maybe we could do it. Maybe we could really be a family, in the stupid, traditional Dan Quayle, golden retriever, grow old together, wear matching jogging suits' kind of way. And then he did get it together  he became that guy. . . and he gets to be that guy with her. Chris is gonna have a baby with his girlfriend. He's gonna marry her. . .and he's gonna be there for her while she's pregnant and he's gonna be there with her while her child grows up, and he's gonna be there for her while she does. . . whatever it is she does. And I am in exactly the same place that I was in before."
"LUKE: Is that so bad? I mean, you got Rory."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do."
"LUKE: You got friends, you got a house, a job, apparently an iron stomach."
"LORELAI: No, it's not so bad. I'm lucky, I know. I just. . .I feel like I'm never gonna have it. . .the whole package, you know? That person, that couple life, and I swear, I hate admitting it because I fancy myself Wonder Woman, but. . .I really want it  the whole package."
"[Luke puts a donut on a plate, then slides it down the counter to her]"
"LUKE: You'll get it."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: How do you know?"
"LUKE: Because I know, okay? I know. Now eat your donut."
"LORELAI: I'm really not very hungry."
"LUKE: Well, take it with you. You will be later."
"[Lorelai wraps up the donut and puts it in her purse, then pulls out some money]"
"LUKE: Forget it, first time customers are on the house. Mimi, was it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: Come again, Mimi."
"LORELAI: Thanks, I will. Seems like a very nice place."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is in the living room as Lorelai walks into the house]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you're home."
"RORY: Yup, I'm home."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, I figured how to get the Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer out of our heads  to sing the Small World song over and over for the next forty-eight hours. Of course, how we get the Small World song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet. Okay, see, that was not how that whole scene between us was supposed to go."
"RORY: No?"
"[They sit down on the couch]"
"LORELAI: No. I mean, yes, I was surprised and I do think the basic sentiment of make up your mind' was kind of called for."
"RORY: Absolutely called for."
"LORELAI: But I didn't mean to upset you and yell at you and make you feel bad, I'm really sorry, hon."
"RORY: I know, but you were right."
"LORELAI: Ah, well, that's once, I guess."
"RORY: So how was dinner?"
"LORELAI: So how was Dean?"
"RORY: So how was dinner?"
"LORELAI: So how was Dean?"
"RORY: Ladies and Gentlemen, the Williams' sisters take center stage at Wimbledon once again."
"LORELAI: Dinner was bad."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: That's okay, I knew it would be. Oh, but the good news is we can now go back to Luke's."
"RORY: You made up! How did you make up?"
"LORELAI: Well, I'm Mimi now."
"RORY: Oh, sure."
"LORELAI: So speaking of Dean, is there still a Dean?"
"RORY: Yeah, there's still a Dean."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: I don't know what I was doing. Maybe it's because I haven't dated a lot but this Jess thing was crazy. And I do love Dean and you were absolutely right  I was treating him like dirt and I wasn't appreciating what was right in front of me, but I'm going to now."
"LORELAI: Rory, I don't want you to stay with Dean because of me."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: Cause I was upset earlier."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: I still have this Christopher thing bugging me and the pressure of tonight's dinner."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: I didn't wanna upset you and I certainly don't want you to make an important decision off of "
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Because it's too important "
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: And I just want you to be happy."
"RORY: Mom! All I did was think about what you said, that's all. Then I analyzed the situation."
"LORELAI: And then you made a pro and con list."
"RORY: You're mocking me, but yes, I did. And after all of this, I came to the conclusion that I want to make things good with Dean, and he deserves my undivided attention."
"LORELAI: And you feel good about this?"
"RORY: I feel really good about this."
"LORELAI: Okay, because if you decided you really did wanna date Jess, I would help you. . .get vaccinated."
"RORY: Thank you, but I'm good."
"LORELAI: All right, as long as you're good."
"RORY: I am good."
"LORELAI: Well, okay, good."
"RORY: What about you, are you good?"
"LORELAI: Me? Well, I'm gonna be good."
"RORY: Is there anything I can do to help?"
"LORELAI: Your existence is a huge help."
"RORY: We're both gonna be good."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I wonder if Christopher and Sherry's baby is going to look like me?"
"RORY: Well, if the kid knows what's good for it, it absolutely will."
"LORELAI: Hand me my purse, will you? I'm hungry."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are sitting in the living room]"
"RORY: Well, this is nice, isn't it? [pause] So, Grandma, Grandpa is traveling again, huh?"
"EMILY: Yes, he is."
"RORY: Business must be good."
"EMILY: Seems to be."
"RORY: That's great. Isn't that great, Mom?"
"LORELAI: A jig is forthcoming."
"RORY: Mom's business is great, too. I mean, not that it's without its problem, you know, but they're usually funny problems. . .like, um. . .oh! Mom, why don't you tell Grandma about the mouse?"
"EMILY: What mouse?"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: There's a mouse at the inn."
"EMILY: Is the place dirty?"
"LORELAI: No, it's just surrounded by this thing called nature and. . .mice happen."
"EMILY: Mice carry diseases, you know."
"LORELAI: It's a tiny little field mouse, Mom."
"EMILY: I don't care how big it is, it's still a rodent."
"LORELAI: Let's just change the subject, shall we?"
"EMILY: You should set a trap."
"LORELAI: Got it covered."
"EMILY: Just make sure you don't use poison."
"LORELAI: Got it covered."
"EMILY: They will eat the poison and then go into the walls and die, decompose, and the entire place will smell."
"LORELAI: I've got it covered, but thanks."
"EMILY: I just have to say, I don't know why you're the one sitting here with an attitude. I'm the one who should be mad."
"LORELAI: Let's not do this, okay Mom?"
"EMILY: After all, you're the one who just walked out of here last week without saying a word."
"LORELAI: Because I couldn't get a word in."
"EMILY: Your father and I were shocked and upset."
"LORELAI: So what else is new?"
"EMILY: You didn't give us five minutes to digest the news."
"LORELAI: Please, find the off switch."
"EMILY: You simply dumped it on us and walked out. I hardly think that's fair."
"LORELAI: Mom, it doesn't matter. It's over. Let's just move on, okay? We came here to have a nice evening, so. . .come on, let's have it. [picks up the newspaper from the coffee table]"
"RORY: Something smells good."
"EMILY: Braised lamb shank."
"RORY: Oh, braised lamb shank! I love a lamb shank when it is braised."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"EMILY: Reading in front of other people is extremely rude, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Shauna Christy sh*t her husband."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Shauna Christy, you remember Shauna Christy."
"EMILY: Yes, I remember Shauna Christy, she was a lovely girl."
"LORELAI: Well, apparently this lovely girl came home to find her husband giving the nanny a nice little bonus package. And they say good help is hard to find."
"EMILY: That's just gossip."
"LORELAI: Gossip? The man was sh*t thirty-five times. He looks like a sprinkler system."
"EMILY: I can't believe this. Shauna was always such a nice girl. She was bright, cultured, well-spoken."
"LORELAI: And apparently a big Annie Oakley fan."
"EMILY: This is not funny, the woman committed a crime."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine."
"EMILY: This is a tragedy."
"LORELAI: My bad, sorry."
"EMILY: A man is dead, a young woman ruined."
"LORELAI: Consider the subject dropped."
"EMILY: At least she had a husband to k*ll."
"LORELAI: This is nice, isn't it?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table; Lorelai sneezes]"
"RORY: Bless you."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Ugh, I hate having a cold."
"RORY: I know you do."
"LORELAI: Ugh, it's bad enough being sick, but anybody can have a cold."
"RORY: I know they can."
"LORELAI: I mean, I'd like to have a good illness, something different, impressive. Just once I'd like to be able to say, ""Yeah, I'm not feeling so good, my leg is haunted."""
"RORY: See, there's a reason why you only take one packet of TheraFlu at a time."
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"[Luke brings their food]"
"LUKE: All right, pancakes, one fried egg, side of bacon. Chicken noodle soup, side of mashed potatoes."
"RORY: Thanks, Luke."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"LUKE: How's the cold coming?"
"LORELAI: It's fine."
"LUKE: Any better?"
"LORELAI: It's fine."
"LUKE: It's the third day in a row you've ordered soup for breakfast."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks for the tally."
"LUKE: You know what helps get rid of a cold?"
"LORELAI: Endless vague questioning first thing in the morning?"
"LUKE: A healthy immune system."
"LORELAI: My second guess."
"LUKE: And you know how you get a healthy immune system?"
"LORELAI: Remember when you hated me? That was fun, wasn't it?"
"LUKE: Is it eating nothing but crap all day and blowing out your brain cells with coffee?"
"RORY: No."
"LUKE: That's right, no."
"LORELAI: Why are you helping him?"
"RORY: No seemed like the right answer."
"LUKE: Eat a vegetable now and then, maybe some high fiber cereal in the morning."
"LORELAI: Listen, Grandpa, my soup's getting cold."
"LUKE: At least eat the carrots in the soup this time, not just the noodles."
"LORELAI: I promise."
"[Luke walks away; Lorelai holds her bowl of soup toward Rory]"
"LORELAI: Eat my carrots."
"RORY: Apparently, maturity is extremely overrated in your universe."
"LORELAI: That's right. The Empress Bobo Belle forbids it. Eat."
"[Jess' girlfriend Shane walks up to Jess at the counter]"
"SHANE: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"[they kiss]"
"SHANE: So?"
"JESS: One sec."
"SHANE: Jess."
"JESS: Relax. I'm out. Let's go."
"SHANE: Okay."
"[they leave]"
"LORELAI: Ladies and gentlemen, an entire conversation in ten words or less."
"RORY: A true meeting of the minds."
"[Dean walks up to their table]"
"DEAN: Okay, so, uh, please don't hate me, but I already ate breakfast."
"RORY: See, nice full sentences."
"DEAN: What?"
"LORELAI: Don't ruin it."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai and Michel are looking into the fireplace]"
"LORELAI: You're sure?"
"MICHEL: Positive. It ran right across the lobby and into the fireplace."
"LORELAI: I don't see it."
"MICHEL: Well, it must've found a hole to crawl into."
"LORELAI: We cannot have this mouse running around the inn. Customers will freak."
"MICHEL: Well, tell them it's a baby. People love babies. They'll talk to it in funny voices."
"LORELAI: Did you call an exterminator?"
"MICHEL: Why, no, what a wonderful idea. I was actually going to fasten a large wedge of cheese to my head and lay on the ground until Mickey gets hungry and decides to crawl out and snack on my face."
"LORELAI: When does he get here?"
"MICHEL: He said we were the first stop."
"LORELAI: What do we do until them?"
"MICHEL: Make cat sounds?"
"[Kirk walks into the inn carrying a package]"
"KIRK: Excuse me, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey Kirk. Hold on a sec. [to Michel] Just stand here and make sure it doesn't come out."
"MICHEL: Oh, goody, a promotion."
"LORELAI: [walks over to Kirk] Hi Kirk. What can I do for ya?"
"KIRK: I have a delivery for Sookie."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, anything good?"
"KIRK: No, just some wedding photos."
"LORELAI: Great. Well, she stepped out for a minute, but I'll take them to her. I swear, I'll give them to her. If you want, I'll leave and find her and then I'll give them to her."
"KIRK: No, that won't be necessary."
"LORELAI: Okay, well. . ."
"KIRK: Uh, Lorelai, can I speak to you for a moment?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure."
"KIRK: Could we sit?"
"LORELAI: Sit. . .sure, let's sit. [they sit down on the sofa] Is everything okay?"
"KIRK: Okay?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"KIRK: With me?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"KIRK: Well, my mother has developed a condition  makes her knees enormous. Yesterday I spent all morning cutting holes in her pants so she could sit, but other than that and the dyspeptic parrot problem, everything is fine."
"LORELAI: Well, good, I'm glad. Okay, well, um, I'm gonna "
"KIRK: I was just wondering . . ."
"LORELAI: Yes. . .wondering what?"
"KIRK: We've known each other for a good amount of time now. Our, uh, paths have crossed professionally and socially a number of times, all with relatively pleasant results, and well, I was just wondering if you would like to have dinner with me?"
"LORELAI: Oh."
"KIRK: In two weeks."
"LORELAI: Two weeks?"
"KIRK: I heard you have a cold. I think two weeks is enough time to ensure the virus is out of your system."
"LORELAI: Well, Kirk, I "
"KIRK: You don't have to answer me right away. I know that this is completely out of the blue for you. Take a few days and think about it. [starts walking toward the door]"
"LORELAI: Kirk, wait."
"KIRK: By the way, I think you might be the prettiest girl I've ever seen. . .outside of a really filthy magazine."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Kirk leaves; Lorelai walks past Michel]"
"LORELAI: Don't."
"MICHEL: I am doing nothing. Ben, however, has dropped dead from laughter."
"CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory wakes up and sees Lorelai sitting in a chair staring at her]"
"RORY: How long have you been sitting there?"
"LORELAI: Not long. An hour. . .and a half."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because."
"RORY: Cause why?"
"LORELAI: Because today is the last first day of high school you're ever gonna have."
"RORY: You're insane."
"LORELAI: I'm not insane, I'm just sentimental, and you're grown."
"RORY: I'm not grown."
"LORELAI: Yes, you are, you're all grown up and soon you'll be going off into the world."
"RORY: Not yet."
"LORELAI: But soon. And after you spread those wings and fly away, I won't have the opportunity to give you this."
"[Lorelai hands her a piece of paper]"
"RORY: What is it?"
"LORELAI: It's your bill."
"RORY: My what?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I've been crunching the numbers, you know, adding up what you've cost me over the years  raising you, clothing you, feeding you, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"LORELAI: Yes, I've itemized everything here by years and income ratio. I thought you could factor it into your student loan."
"RORY: Oh boy."
"LORELAI: One thing that's painfully obvious here  you've used an extraordinary number of diapers."
"RORY: I'm gonna go take a shower."
"LORELAI: Really, it's cost a fortune. What were you using all those diapers for?"
"RORY: I was building my make Mommy go away' castle."
"LORELAI: All right, you got home too late last night and I didn't get a chance to talk to you."
"RORY: I got home at ten and you were already asleep."
"LORELAI: Well, I was trying to watch The Legend of Bagger Vance again."
"RORY: Okay, what did I miss?"
"LORELAI: Okay. Kirk asked me out."
"RORY: Shut up!"
"LORELAI: Yesterday he came to the inn and asked me to dinner."
"RORY: That's so sweet."
"LORELAI: Sweet?"
"RORY: You should wear your dress with the ponies on it. I bet he likes ponies."
"LORELAI: Rory, I cannot go out with Kirk."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh. . .why? He's. . .he's Kirk!"
"RORY: Well, as long as he loves you."
"LORELAI: You are not serious."
"RORY: I just want you to be happy."
"LORELAI: ""Hello Headmaster Charleston, this is my stepfather Kirk. Please don't make any sudden movements, he's a fear biter."""
"RORY: Okay, so how will you let him down?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. That's why I needed to talk to you, you're the nice one in the family."
"RORY: Well, you could just tell him the truth. You could tell him that you're not interested in dating him and that you just wanna be friends."
"LORELAI: That sounds so lame."
"RORY: You could tell him you're involved with someone."
"LORELAI: Yeah, because my current karma is so great in that area, I can really afford to jinx it with that kind of lie  no!"
"RORY: Okay, then you figure it out."
"LORELAI: All right. . .we're gonna have to move."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Take off in the middle of the night, leave everything behind, assume different identities. I'll join a local community theater and I'll drive you to soccer. It'll work for many years until the FBI comes to get me, and by that time, you're on your own."
"RORY: I don't play soccer."
"LORELAI: You do now."
"[they walk into the kitchen; as they start getting out stuff for breakfast, Rory laughs.]"
"LORELAI: Stop!"
"RORY: It's funny."
"LORELAI: It's not funny, it's bad! I have to see this guy. He works at every business in town, I can't get away from him!"
"RORY: Well, then you should marry him and move in with his mother."
"LORELAI: I'll handle it myself, thank you very much."
"RORY: Sorry, just trying to help."
"LORELAI: So you have your swearing in ceremony today."
"RORY: At three, do not be late."
"LORELAI: I will not be late."
"RORY: Okay, I have something to tell you."
"LORELAI: Is it about Vince Foster?"
"RORY: It's about Grandma."
"LORELAI: Oops."
"RORY: She's coming today."
"LORELAI: No!"
"RORY: Mom, I'm sorry. She found out about it, she called. . ."
"LORELAI: And you said yes?"
"RORY: She's my grandmother."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: So what am I supposed to say?"
"LORELAI: Say ""Sorry, Grandma, but if my mother sees you, she'll run screaming down the hall."""
"RORY: You'll be sitting there listening to the ceremony, you hardly have to talk at all."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Hey, we are family."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, look how great that worked out for Sister Sledge."
"RORY: I'm gonna go take a shower. You'll be pouting out here when I'm done?"
"LORELAI: No, I gotta go to work. I'll see you this afternoon."
"RORY: At three."
"LORELAI: There goes my little vice president, off to rule the world."
"RORY: Well, Paris will be ruling the world. I will be holding her keys."
"LORELAI: I'm still proud of you."
"RORY: I appreciate it."
"LORELAI: Honey, you have power, brains, now all you need is a dimwitted, drunken or drug-addicted relative to constantly humiliate you while you serve in office."
"RORY: Will you work on that for me?"
"LORELAI: Two steps ahead of you."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory is standing in the hallway as Lorelai runs up to her]"
"LORELAI: Ah, time?"
"RORY: 3:01."
"LORELAI: No, oh man, not fair, stupid traffic lights!"
"RORY: That's okay, it doesn't start til 3:15."
"LORELAI: But I so tried to . . . you lied to me."
"RORY: Did I?"
"LORELAI: You said it was at three, and it's at three-fifteen."
"RORY: Well, I guess I did."
"LORELAI: Ah! That's it, I'm standing up in the middle of your speech and demanding a recount."
"RORY: Shall we seat you?"
"LORELAI: Betrayed, lied to and humiliated."
"[they walk into the auditorium]"
"RORY: Well, get used to it  I am in politics now."
"LORELAI: Hey, where's, uh. . ."
"RORY: She's not here yet."
"LORELAI: You told her the real time, didn't you?"
"RORY: Well, Grandma can handle structure. How's this?"
"LORELAI: Fine."
"RORY: Okay, great. You can sit there and you can put your purse on that chair to save it for Grandma."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, great idea."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Fine, yeah, saving the seat. [sits down and puts her purse on the chair next to her] There, all saved."
"RORY: Thank you. Now, I'll meet right outside afterwards, okay?"
"LORELAI: Okay. I just want you to remember three things while you're sitting up there: I love you, you're the greatest kid in the world, and you're in a skirt, keep your knees closed."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Hey, this is good advice. When I was in school, Linda Lee was class treasurer and she could not keep her knees closed if they were magnetized. Hanes should've given her an endorsement deal."
"[Rory walks away; Lorelai takes her purse off the seat next to her and holds it on her lap...then puts it back on the chair...then picks it back up again. She's about to put it back on the chair when Emily walks up]"
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"EMILY: [sits down] You could've put your handbag there to save my seat, you know."
"[cut to Headmaster Charleston at the podium on stage]"
"HEADMASTER: Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome you. Assemblies like this are always happy ones for me, initiating in a new group of school leaders. Chilton's always prided itself on the quality of its student government, and this year we may have outdone ourselves. These young men and women up on this stage represent the best and the brightest of what this school has to offer. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present to you your student body government of 2003. [applause]"
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"RORY: [at podium] . . .a larger awareness of the world around us. Problems that not only face us here at school but will face us when we leave school, and more importantly, will face the next generation that follows us. We must learn that our actions have consequences, that someone else will have to clean up our mess. We need to figure out how to make that mess a little smaller. If a small fraction of these things can be accomplished this year, then I will feel like our administration has done its job. Thank you. [applause]"
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"PARIS: [at podium] In the past, all great empires have fallen. The feeling seems to be that it's inevitable  that something like what the Romans built could not last. Maybe they're right. Maybe there is no way of keeping something that big and prosperous permanently. Maybe there is no way of keeping our legacy from becoming obsolete. Well, I intend to fly in the face of such thinking, and damn it, I will succeed. I certainly don't wanna come back here twenty years from now on Alumni's Night and find this place turned into a high priced charm school, pink and white with big cheerleading megaphones painted on the walls. I wouldn't be able to take it. I would have to dismantle the place stone by stone with my bare hands. . ."
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"ALL STUDENTS ON STAGE: I have faith in the Chilton Handbook, so let it be forever."
"HEADMASTER: Congratulations and good luck. [applause]"
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Emily are waiting outside the auditorium.]"
"EMILY: Is Rory coming out?"
"LORELAI: That's what she said. It was a nice ceremony."
"EMILY: Yes, it was."
"LORELAI: Long."
"EMILY: Very long."
"LORELAI: The longest."
"EMILY: Lorelai "
"RORY: [walking up to them] Hey. You're both here."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we're here."
"EMILY: Of course we're here. We wouldn't have missed it for the world. You looked wonderful up there, Rory."
"LORELAI: Yeah, good job with the knees."
"RORY: Thank you. I'm gonna run to my locker and get my backpack, then we can go."
"LORELAI: I'll be here."
"RORY: Bye Grandma. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: You know, you don't have to wait, Mom, if you have things to do."
"EMILY: Oh. . .well, all right. [starts to walk away, then turns back] Lorelai, I was wondering if we could have lunch."
"LORELAI: Lunch?"
"EMILY: Yes, just the two of us."
"LORELAI: Oh, well "
"EMILY: Tomorrow would be good for me."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow, lunch tomorrow, lunch with you tomorrow. . ."
"EMILY: We can do it anywhere you'd like. Perhaps at that Luke's Diner you two seem to love so much."
"LORELAI: Lunch  at Luke's  with you? Wow, I can't even put the visual together."
"EMILY: I can meet you there at one."
"LORELAI: One? Well "
"EMILY: If one isn't good, you pick a time. I'll make it work."
"LORELAI: All right. One o'clock at Luke's."
"EMILY: Wonderful. I'll see you then."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Several students are sitting at a table as Paris walks around them talking]"
"PARIS: Look, let's face it, the last administration might have just as well been running around yelling Toga!' for all the brilliant things they accomplished. But this year  everything changes, starting with the library. It's completely out of proportion with its subjects. I mean, there's five hundred volumes on the French Revolution, yet only three on the Crusades. How do they expect us to get a decent education with inferior resources like that? Huh, seems like the hour's almost up. Okay, well, I think this has been an extremely successful first gathering. I appreciate all the class presidents coming and being on time. So before I adjourn this meeting, is there anything anyone would like to say?"
"RORY: People's names might have been nice."
"FRANCIE: Actually, I have something I'd like to put on the table to be discussed."
"PARIS: Oh, okay. Well, we only have a couple of minutes, so give us the Reader's Digest version."
"FRANCIE: As president of the senior class, a certain problem has been brought to my attention. For the past thirty years, the Chilton regulations have stated that skirts must be no higher than three-quarters of an inch above the knee, that's it. Any higher, the student gets written up. I propose to put to an immediate vote an amendment to raise hemlines an additional inch and a half."
"PARIS: Hemlines?"
"FRANCIE: That's right."
"PARIS: That's the major issue on the senior class' mind?"
"FRANCIE: It's one of the major issues, yes."
"PARIS: Well, okay  thank you, Francie, for giving us something really important to mull over here. I anticipate a lot of sleepless nights for many of the people in this room. I will take that under advisement and get back to you as soon as I can."
"FRANCIE: Oh, okay, fine. Thanks."
"PARIS: Now, if that's it, I officially call the first meeting of the Chilton student body presidents to a close. I'll see you all Friday. [bangs gavel on the table]"
"GIRL: What idiot gave her a gavel?"
"[Rory walks up to Paris]"
"RORY: Okay, see, the whole point of having an informal get to know you' gathering was actually to have an informal get to know you' gathering."
"PARIS: What's your point?"
"RORY: You just spent an hour walking around talking about your agenda."
"PARIS: I'm student body president  that's my job."
"RORY: But we got donuts, and we didn't touch the donuts. The donuts are still sitting next to the coffee that we never passed out. We were supposed to spend this time to talk, bond, get to know each other."
"PARIS: Geez, Rory, we've been sitting in a room together for sixty minutes  what else do you want, a ring?"
"FRANCIE: Hi. Excuse me, Paris? I just wanted to say on behalf of the entire senior class, congratulations on your win and I'm really looking forward to working very closely with you this year."
"PARIS: Thanks."
"FRANCIE: Okay. See you later. Bye Rory. You two are gonna make a great team. [leaves]"
"PARIS: Yes, the jerseys are coming on Friday. [to Rory] Okay, I'm gonna drop the demand for the librarian's resignation tonight. You wanna read it before I send it?"
"RORY: Are you sure the first thing you wanna do in office is to get a ninety-three year old woman sacked?"
"PARIS: Hey, at least I'm not putting her on an iceberg and shoving her off to sea, which considering the fact that you can't find the Shakespeare section without psychic powers yet the Cliffs Notes rack practically smacks you in the face on the way in, is totally justified."
"RORY: And we're off."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie walks up to Lorelai in the lobby]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, I just got a message that a vegetarian menu was requested for tonight."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Lasano's, party of five at eight o'clock."
"SOOKIE: I thought you said you weren't gonna let vegetarians in here anymore."
"LORELAI: No, you said you weren't gonna let vegetarians in here anymore."
"SOOKIE: But I'm making my baked stuffed pork chops for tonight."
"LORELAI: Well, make them for the other guests and make something else for the Lasano's."
"SOOKIE: Like what?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Pasta, you make great pasta."
"SOOKIE: But that's boring, anyone can make pasta. I'm an artist. You don't dictate to an artist, you don't tell him what to do. I mean, no ever walked up to Degas and said, ""Hey, pal, easy with the dancers, enough already. Draw a nice fruit bowl once in awhile, will ya?"""
"LORELAI: A great artist can make art out of anything, including pasta."
"SOOKIE: Fine, pasta, whoo."
"LORELAI: Is there coffee?"
"SOOKIE: Just made some."
"LORELAI: Great."
"SOOKIE: So today's your lunch with Emily."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"SOOKIE: Any idea what she's gonna say?"
"LORELAI: No, but I bet it's not, ""I'm joining the circus, feed your father until I get back."" I should just cancel."
"SOOKIE: You can't cancel, you're meeting her in an hour."
"LORELAI: I know, but this goes against every rule I have in the Gilmore survival guide. Number one  no running with scissors. Number two  no pageboy haircuts. Number three  never ever have lunch alone with a mother."
"SOOKIE: It might not be so bad."
"LORELAI: Saying yes to this lunch with my mother is like saying ""Sounds fun!"" to a ride with Clemenza."
"[they walk into the kitchen]"
"SOOKIE: Think good thoughts, she could surprise you."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"SOOKIE: People change, you know. They do it every day. I mean, one minute you could be. . .oh, let's say a vegetarian, and the next minute you could accidentally have a bite of a stuffed pork chop that changes your entire way of thinking."
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Oh, suddenly life's fun, suddenly there's a reason to get up in the morning  it's called bacon!"
"LORELAI: Forget it."
"SOOKIE: Come on!"
"LORELAI: Pasta."
"SOOKIE: Let the people grow, dammit!"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory is walking down the hallway when someone pulls her into the bathroom. Francie and two of her friends are in there.]"
"FRANCIE: Rory, hi, nice of you to join us."
"RORY: Francie, what "
"FRANCIE: No, I talk, okay? Great. Now let's discuss Paris."
"RORY: What about her?"
"FRANCIE: She seems to have the very strange idea that she's actually in charge around here, and I thought it'd be good if I let you in on a little secret. . .she's not."
"RORY: Why don't you tell her this yourself?"
"FRANCIE: Because talking to Paris is like shopping for a bathing suit in December  frustrating, fruitless, and a complete waste of time. Now, you, you might be the wallflower, but you're obviously the Meyer Lansky behind this organization."
"RORY: I am not the Meyer Lansky."
"FRANCIE: What's that noise? What is that noise? Oh wait, it's me, still talking. Didn't you hear it? Obviously not. Anyhow, Paris is student body president  big fat deal. There are three other class presidents  the junior class president, the sophomore class president, and oh, yes, the senior class president  me."
"RORY: I know all this."
"FRANCIE: Well, then, it's off the short bus for you, isn't it? Now if Paris thinks she's gonna march around dictating mandates and ignoring what I have to say, then she's in for a major bikini wax."
"RORY: Thanks for the visual."
"FRANCIE: Without me, she's nothing. Just another power mad, insecure, friendless, dateless, highlight-less loser wandering around trying to make someone care that they exist at all, which, by the way, no one does. I control the senior class. I am also the leader of the Puffs, the most exclusive society on this campus, and I have the power to make her life a living hell."
"RORY: Francie, she's just "
"FRANCIE: I can make sure she does nothing this year but lead the student body in whatever version of the Pledge of Allegiance happens to be constitutional at the time."
"RORY: What do you want me to do about it?"
"FRANCIE: I want you to go back to Margaret Thatcher and tell her to play ball. She's gonna support the hemline issue, and any other issue that I bring up for the rest of the year. Otherwise I'll make her so ineffectual, she'll make Jimmy Carter look like Martin Sheen  do you get me?"
"RORY: We're supposed to be representing the interests of the student body. We are not supposed to be brokering backdoor deals and pushing through agendas with intimidation and bribery. I mean, what are we, French skating judges?"
"FRANCIE: Wise up, Goldilocks."
"RORY: My hair's brown."
"FRANCIE: This is politics. If you've got a problem, tell it to Noam Chomsky. I live in the real world, now blow. Oh, and I would keep this conversation between you and me. Paris tends to get a little paranoid when there's other mammals at the watering hole, so her finding out that you were conferring with me might not make your vice presidency any easier."
"RORY: I am not conferring with you. A hand came out of the bathroom and pulled me in."
"FRANCIE: What are you talking about? You sought me out because you thought Paris was a little out of line today and you wanted to make sure my very delicate feelings weren't hurt. You are so sweet to think of me. I feel much better now that I have you on my side. Bye now, see you at the hemster."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks through the door and looks around for Emily]"
"LUKE: What the hell are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Ah, I came for the warmth."
"LUKE: Well, you're just not usually here this time of day, that's all."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm meeting someone for lunch."
"LUKE: Oh, Kirk?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You're meeting Kirk?"
"LORELAI: Why would you say that?"
"LUKE: Well, I know he asked you out so I just assumed."
"LORELAI: How do you know he asked me out?"
"LUKE: He told me."
"LORELAI: He told you?"
"LUKE: Yesterday."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"LUKE: Hey, relax, I think it's great."
"LORELAI: Why, why would he tell you?"
"LUKE: Well, actually, he came to me for a little advice."
"LORELAI: About what?"
"LUKE: About whether or not I thought he had a sh*t with you. After all, I know ya, I've been to your house, I know whether or not you have stain resistant rugs."
"[Lorelai sits down at a table]"
"LORELAI: I'm lying down now."
"LUKE: When he found out you had wood floors, he seemed very pleased."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: I told him you like movies and junk food, and of course, talking incessantly, but we both agreed that there's nothing like some good lovin' to shut a person up, if you know what I mean."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, can you bring me a sharper fork? I'm not sure this one will go all the way through your hand."
"LUKE: Okay, now, I know it's new so you probably don't wanna jinx it, so I won't talk about it anymore. But I have to tell you, seeing that guy's face when he was talking about you. . .he almost had an expression."
"LORELAI: Far, far away from me."
"LUKE: [sings] Love is in the air."
"[Lorelai throws a spoon at him as he walks away]"
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"[Emily walks into the diner]"
"EMILY: Why are you throwing cutlery in a public place?"
"LORELAI: Uh, cause I feel stupid doing it at home?"
"EMILY: I'm sorry I'm late, there was a little traffic on the way. Perhaps had I been on time, there would still be the possibility of soup."
"LORELAI: I haven't been here that long. See, I still have a knife."
"EMILY: I'm glad to hear it."
"LORELAI: So, you gonna sit?"
"EMILY: Oh, yes, of course. [wipes off the seat, then sits down] There we go. Well, this is nice. You certainly can see the whole town from here, can't you?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you can."
"EMILY: I can see why you come here so much. It must be fun to just sit and people-watch. Well, let's see what they've got, shall we? [opens menu] Oh, Caesar salad  is that good here?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm sure it is."
"EMILY: You've never had it?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Has Rory?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Oh. Well, Caesar salads can be extremely unsafe if they use bad eggs."
"LORELAI: Get something else."
"EMILY: Of course, if they're coddled, it would be fine. Do you know if they coddle the eggs here?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea."
"EMILY: You don't know? You come here every day."
"LORELAI: Why don't you ask Luke if they're coddled?"
"EMILY: Oh, he'll just say they are. I'll have a Cobb salad. What are you going to have?"
"LORELAI: A Caesar salad with extra uncoddled eggs on the side."
"EMILY: Really, Lorelai, would a serious answer once in awhile k*ll you?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, Mom. Uh, honestly, I'm a little confused."
"EMILY: About what?"
"LORELAI: About this."
"EMILY: What's confusing? We're having lunch."
"LORELAI: I know we're having lunch, but we don't usually have lunch, especially not in my town at Luke's Diner."
"EMILY: I just figured you had to work, it'd be easier on you this way."
"LORELAI: Okay, that's fine, if I "
"[Luke walks up to the table]"
"LUKE: You two ready to order?"
"EMILY: Yes. How is your Caesar salad dressing prepared?"
"LUKE: I'll have to call Paul Newman and ask him."
"EMILY: A Cobb salad and an iced tea."
"LORELAI: Cheeseburger, fries, onion rings and a cherry coke."
"LUKE: Any pie today?"
"LORELAI: Hm, no thanks."
"LUKE: Cutting back a little, huh? Trying to look good for the big day. Smart, very smart."
"LORELAI: Make sure you check that frying oil with your face."
"[Luke walks away]"
"EMILY: What was that all about?"
"LORELAI: Ah, nothing, just a little small town charm. Now, please, Mom, tell me  why did you ask me to lunch?"
"EMILY: Because I wanted to spend some time alone with my daughter."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Well, Rory drops by after school every now and then, so we see her alone."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: But we never see you alone. . .unless Rory leaves the room for a second, and even then you try to go with her. If I had a nickel for every time you've used the Girls always go to the bathroom together, Mom' line, I'd be a very rich woman."
"LORELAI: You are a very rich woman. Mom, please, is this really a me and you' lunch? No hidden agenda?"
"EMILY: Of course not."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine."
"EMILY: I talked to Christopher."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: I called him last week, we talked for a very long time, and I have to tell you, he is not in love with that woman."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"EMILY: He never came out and said it, but I could tell from his voice. He would much rather be with you and Rory."
"LORELAI: Are you out of your mind?"
"EMILY: I think you need to talk to him."
"LORELAI: And that would be a yes."
"EMILY: All he needs is to hear that you want this, too."
"LORELAI: Mom, what the hell are you doing calling Christopher?"
"EMILY: Well, somebody had to."
"LORELAI: No, somebody didn't have to!"
"EMILY: Oh, I certainly wasn't going to just sit by and watch this situation explode. You two belong together. It took you years to figure that out, and now that you finally have it, you can't let it go away just because of a little complication."
"LORELAI: Mom, his girlfriend is pregnant  that is more than a little complication."
"EMILY: Women have gotten pregnant since the beginning of time, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: And before I result to the totally called for duh, please tell me what your point it."
"EMILY: This woman is trying to trap him. Don't you see that? You can't let that happen."
"LORELAI: Mom, this is none of your business."
"EMILY: Yes, it is! It affects Rory, it affects you  both of whom are my business."
"LORELAI: Do not get involved in this, I mean it. Butt out! Don't call Christopher and talk about me or us, just stay out of it!"
"EMILY: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I have to get back to the inn."
"EMILY: Do not walk out on me."
"LORELAI: Mom, I am not gonna discuss this with you now or ever. I would love for you to respect that but I know you, so give Christopher my love."
"EMILY: A family life doesn't just happen, Lorelai. You have to work for it. You have to fight for it. Lorelai, come back here!"
"[Lorelai walks out]"

"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Several students are gathered at a table for a meeting]"
"PARIS: So as soon as she gets out of intensive care, we'll get her signature, and then we can finally set about hiring a new librarian. Anything else?"
"LOUISE: Yes. Uh, I was thinking that maybe this year we should throw a little beginning of the school year dance. I mean, why wait until the tan fades to have a formal?"
"PARIS: Dances are distracting."
"LOUISE: Dances help bring in money to pay for those stupid topiaries you want in the quad."
"PARIS: Draft a proposal and have it on my desk by tomorrow. Madeline?"
"MADELINE: I would like to explore the option of having a professional photographer take the senior class photos. Every year we use that cheesy picture place, and every year people wind up with those VH1 Before They Were Stars' pictures, and I for one would like to stop the humiliation now."
"PARIS: How are we going to get a professional photographer?"
"LOUISE: Helmett Newton is my godfather."
"PARIS: Okay, sign him up  and tell him to leave the whips and chains at home. All right, I think that's all we have time for today."
"FRANCIE: Um, excuse me, Paris? I was just wondering if you had time to think about my proposal?"
"PARIS: What proposal?"
"FRANCIE: You know, the higher hemlines."
"PARIS: Oh right. No, not yet."
"FRANCIE: Okay, I guess I can wait. . . for awhile."
"PARIS: Patience is a virtue."
"[The meeting ends and the students disperse from the table. Rory turns to talk to Paris.]"
"RORY: Hey."
"PARIS: What do you think about Helmett Newton being Louise's godfather? Explains a lot, doesn't it?"
"RORY: Yeah. Listen, I think it might be a good idea to consider getting behind this hemline issue."
"PARIS: You're kidding, right?"
"RORY: No. I mean, if girls want the option of making their skirts a little shorter, then who cares, right?"
"PARIS: I care. I'm building a legacy here, Rory. You want the first stand I make against the faculty to involve a fashion choice? It would be my gays in the military.'"
"RORY: I just think it would be really smart to establish some goodwill among the other class presidents."
"PARIS: Why?"
"RORY: Because you have to work with them, and you might even need their support on something in the future. And throwing them a tiny bone like a hemline amendment is no big deal."
"PARIS: I don't know."
"RORY: Look, it's right at the beginning of your term. No one will even remember the first stupid thing that you passed. You have plenty of time to establish your legacy. I mean it. By the time that you implement public executions for line cutters, hemlines will be a thing of the past. [pause] I was making a joke not a suggestion."
"PARIS: Why do you care?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Why do you care? You seem very invested in this whole thing  why?"
"RORY: Hey, I'm not invested in this thing. If you don't wanna do it, fine. I'm just giving you my opinion. I just thought you might wanna be one of those presidents that's beloved as well as respected."
"PARIS: Raising hemlines would make me beloved?"
"RORY: It's certainly a step in that direction."
"PARIS: All right, I'll push it through."
"RORY: Good."
"PARIS: But the next genius who comes up with the brilliant plan to put Elizabeth Arden in the chemistry class can bite my ass."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks into the living room as Lorelai walks down the steps]"
"LORELAI: Ugh, I'm not going."
"RORY: You are going."
"LORELAI: She has done this to me for the last time. From now on, I'm not giving her any information about my life at all."
"RORY: As opposed to all the details you've heaped upon her in the past."
"LORELAI: I can't believe she called Christopher. She has no respect for me or my feelings or my privacy."
"RORY: Well, she didn't think of it that way. She thought that she was helping."
"LORELAI: You do know there isn't a Santa Claus, don't you?"
"RORY: Please just try to forget this."
"LORELAI: I'm never ever going over there again."
"RORY: Not an option."
"LORELAI: It should be. Sometimes you have to cut people out of your life."
"RORY: She's your mother."
"LORELAI: I want proof, I want tests done."
"RORY: Do you want your red purse or your blue?"
"LORELAI: Blue. Gee, I wonder who else she's calling. She's probably on the phone to Kirk right now. ""I heard through my spies you're taking my daughter out to dinner. Let's talk China patterns."" God, I'm furious! [phone rings] Don't get that, it might be her."
"RORY: Well, I doubt she'd call when we're supposed to be over in half an hour."
"KIRK: [on answering machine] Hello? Hello? [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: The answering machine confused him."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: And that's the guy who likes me."
"RORY: I'd consider adoption if I were you."
"LORELAI: My life stinks. Hey, let's look into each other's eyes and say ""I wish I were you"" at exactly the same time  maybe we'll pull a Freaky Friday!"
"RORY: Or we can just pretend that we did and you can go around acting really immature. Oh wait. . ."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you won't switch bodies with me."
"RORY: Forget it. Then I'd have to date Kirk."
"LORELAI: I would switch bodies with you in a b*at if you wanted."
"[phone rings again]"
"RORY: I know, and I appreciate that."
"KIRK: [on answering machine] Lorelai, hi. I just called, I think there might be a problem with your phone."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"KIRK: [on machine] I was just wondering if I could ask you. . ."
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"KIRK: [on machine] . . .a couple of quick questions "
"KIRK'S MOM: [on machine] Hello?"
"KIRK: [on machine] Mom?"
"KIRK'S MOM: [on machine] Who is this?"
"KIRK: [on machine] Mom, would you please get off the phone? Mom?"
"KIRK'S MOM: [on machine] Is this Dr. Marshall?"
"KIRK: [on machine] Mom, it's an important phone call, please hang up. I  I  I  I'll call you back."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings several times]"
"EMILY: [walking toward door] Oh, for heaven's sake. [answers door]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I don't think your doorbell's working."
"EMILY: Believe me, it's not the doorbell."
"MAID: [walks up behind them] Oh, so it was the door."
"EMILY: Yes, Sarah, once again, it was the door."
"SARAH: Okay, so I just have to remember that the really big bell is the door and the small one is the oven."
"EMILY: Yes, that would be a wonderful thing to remember."
"[Sarah walks away]"
"EMILY: Okay, well, let's have a drink, shall we?"
"[they walk to the living room]"
"RORY: So, Grandma, you have a new maid?"
"EMILY: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Well, good thing we're in time for happy hour."
"EMILY: Wine, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah, if there's any left."
"EMILY: Rory  soda or water?"
"RORY: Uh, soda please."
"EMILY: How about water?"
"RORY: Water's fine, too."
"LORELAI: What's up, Mom?"
"EMILY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: You seem tense."
"EMILY: You always think I seem tense."
"LORELAI: But tonight you seem tenser than usual."
"EMILY: Well, I'm not! Rory, tell me about school"
"RORY: Oh, okay, um. . .school's good."
"EMILY: Do you like student government?"
"RORY: I think so."
"EMILY: And your grades are still good?"
"RORY: Yes."
"EMILY: Do you take any sort of physical education?"
"RORY: Not this semester."
"EMILY: But eventually you will take some sort of physical education?"
"RORY: I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: But trust me  the minute she decides to run after a ball and take a public shower with thirty other girls, you are getting a call."
"EMILY: Well, thank you."
"SARAH: [enters room] Dinner's ready!"
"EMILY: Sarah, one minute please."
"SARAH: Yeah?"
"EMILY: I told you we eat dinner at seven. . .and right now, it's six-thirty. Therefore, one could conclude that maybe it's just a tad early for dinner."
"SARAH: Oh, I'm sorry, I -"
"EMILY: We want to eat at seven!"
"SARAH: But the food's ready now."
"EMILY: Okay, never mind, we'll eat. We're eating. Up, up, let's go. [they walk toward the dining room] It's fine. It's better  then we can all be in bed by nine. Sit down."
"LORELAI: Mom, tell us what is up right now."
"EMILY: What is up with what?"
"LORELAI: With you, with her, with you and her."
"EMILY: Well, she's new, Lorelai. She's only been here three days, she's still getting the hang of things. I think it's only fair to give the woman a chance. Why are you staring at me?"
"LORELAI: Mom, you've had maids deported who were better than her."
"EMILY: I have not."
"LORELAI: Talk."
"EMILY: Your father made a crack the other day about my not being able to keep a maid."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"EMILY: Of course, it's a gross exaggeration. Yes, I've had maids I haven't liked, but I've also had maids I've loved."
"LORELAI: Name one."
"EMILY: Daiha."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"EMILY: You remember, she took you shopping once."
"LORELAI: How old was I?"
"EMILY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Guess."
"EMILY: Four, five."
"LORELAI: Mom, you haven't liked a maid since I was four or five?"
"EMILY: I have liked a maid; you asked me whom I loved. I loved Daiha."
"LORELAI: And whatever happened to Daiha?"
"EMILY: Oh, how should I know? But I loved her."
"[the maid enters with some plates]"
"SARAH: Okay, so salad?"
"EMILY: Thank you, Sarah."
"[doorbell rings]"
"SARAH: Oops, big bell. [goes to answer it and takes the salad plates with her]"
"EMILY: Sarah, the salad! Sarah! Pass the wine, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You want a straw with that?"
"EMILY: You're enjoying this?"
"LORELAI: Well. . .yeah."
"[Christopher walks in]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor, I need to talk to you."
"LORELAI: Chris, what are you doing here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You won't return my calls!"
"LORELAI: Did you do this?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I knew you'd be here."
"EMILY: I did not do this."
"CHRISTOPHER: You gave me no choice."
"LORELAI: After I told you to just stay out of it!"
"EMILY: Lorelai, I did not do this!"
"LORELAI: You have to go."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm not going until you talk to me."
"[Lorelai and Christopher walk down the hallway]"
"EMILY: Christopher, Lorelai, come back here!"
"[cut to hallway]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Why won't you call me back?"
"LORELAI: Hey, there couldn't be a worst time to have this conversation."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really, because it seems to be the only time to have this conversation."
"LORELAI: Look, go home, okay? I promise I will talk to you tomorrow."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, sure, I believe that."
"LORELAI: Hey, I've never lied to you. There's no reason to doubt my word."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really? Forty-five unreturned phone calls isn't a reason?"
"LORELAI: No, it isn't."
"CHRISTOPHER: You shutting me out like this is wrong."
"LORELAI: I'm not discussing this with you here in my mother's house."
"CHRISTOPHER: You don't get to dictate this. I need to talk to you, you won't call me back, and I did what I had to do. And I'm sorry  but after all we've been through, especially over these last few months  you shutting me out is wrong. And you know what hits me the hardest, Lor?"
"LORELAI: Apparently it isn't the door on your way out."
"CHRISTOPHER: You keeping Rory from me."
"LORELAI: What?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I never, ever thought you'd do that."
"LORELAI: I'm not keeping Rory from you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh really? Then why hasn't she called me back, huh? I mean, no matter where you and I have been in our lives, my daughter has always called me back  until now."
"LORELAI: Hey, listen to me "
"[Rory walks up to them]"
"RORY: I didn't call you back because I didn't want to. Me  Mom had nothing to do with it."
"LORELAI: Okay, honey, calm down."
"RORY: You promised me. You promised me at Sookie's wedding that this was going to work, that you were going to be there, you promised me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Honey, please understand "
"RORY: No, I always understand, and I don't wanna understand! I don't even really wanna talk about this right now. I've got Mom, that's all I need. Go be somebody else's dad!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Don't say that."
"RORY: I'm going upstairs. Call me when he's gone. [goes upstairs]"
"CHRISTOPHER: She did not get there by herself."
"LORELAI: Hey, have you ever met your daughter? She could get anywhere by herself! She could get to the third dimension by herself! She was helping the crossing guard when she was four."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm going to talk to her."
"LORELAI: No, you're not. She wants to be alone and cool off. Respect that. I'll talk to her later."
"CHRISTOPHER: You'll talk to her, great. That makes me feel a whole lot better."
"LORELAI: Okay, you need to leave, right now."
"CHRISTOPHER: This isn't right. She needs her father."
"LORELAI: I know she needs her father, I've been telling her she needs her father! But she feels like her father bailed on her and she's mad and hurt, and I can't change that in three minutes!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Do you think I like this situation?"
"LORELAI: Oh God."
"CHRISTOPHER: Do you? I mean, after what you and I had going and now "
"LORELAI: Chris, do you remember why we're here right now? What event in your life caused this very pleasant moment we're sharing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: That has nothing to do with this."
"LORELAI: Oh  it  what? Chris, man! What do you want from me?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I wanna talk!"
"LORELAI: About what?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I don't know. I just. . . I don't like how things are."
"LORELAI: But that's how they are!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I didn't want things to turn out this way!"
"LORELAI: But they did turn out this way!"
"CHRISTOPHER: But I didn't want that!"
"LORELAI: Christopher, is Sherry still pregnant?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Of course she is."
"LORELAI: Are you still with her?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Are you gonna marry her?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Then, honey, we are where we are! Accept it."
"CHRISTOPHER: I can't."
"LORELAI: Don't you understand that I can't talk to you because it hurts talking to you, really hurts! Standing here right now is k*ll me, okay? Don't you understand that?"
"EMILY: Christopher, I think you'd better go now."
"CHRISTOPHER: Emily, I . . ."
"EMILY: Leave now, please."
"[Christopher leaves]"
"LORELAI: You know, you need a mask and a horse when you do that."
"EMILY: Something's burning."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Christopher is sitting on his motorcycle as Lorelai walks out of the house]"
"LORELAI: Chris? Give it time."
"[Christopher nods and drives away]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Rory and Lorelai walk down the sidewalk]"
"LORELAI: Well, now, that was a fun night."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: I haven't had that much fun since labor."
"RORY: Ba-dum-bum."
"LORELAI: But seriously, ladies and gentlemen, is this on?"
"RORY: I can't believe he just came over."
"LORELAI: He misses you."
"RORY: He misses you."
"LORELAI: We're very missable. Honey, he loves you so much, he didn't mean to mess "
"RORY: No, he never means to, but he does. And I don't care what he says or does, I'm not going to this wedding."
"LORELAI: You don't have to."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: But you might, at a later point in your life, when you're not so angry and you make up with your dad, as we both know you will, you might be sorry you missed it."
"RORY: It's the wrong wedding."
"LORELAI: Ah, things happen for a reason."
"RORY: Since when is that your philosophy."
"LORELAI: Since now. By the way, I'm also a communist."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes, cause I look damn good in red."
"RORY: I'm starving."
"LORELAI: Really? Could it be cause dinner sucked?"
"RORY: Could be."
"LORELAI: Let's do mac and cheese."
"RORY: And tater tots"
"LORELAI: And those little pizza rolls."
"RORY: Oh, and chili beef soup."
"LORELAI: After which we will install our own vomitorium."
"RORY: Okay, nix the soup."
"LORELAI: And add some cake. Okay, let's be organized  make it fast, make it snappy, and if there's any impulse buying, make it chocolate."
"RORY: Aye aye, captain."
"KIRK: [calls from down the street] Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Oh no. Go on in."
"RORY: Are you sure?"
"LORELAI: I have to take care of this."
"RORY: Good luck."
"[Rory goes into the market as Kirk walks up to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk."
"KIRK: Lorelai, I know you haven't made up your mind yet, and I'm not here for an answer. I just need to know  are you allergic to tuna?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"KIRK: No, good. Thank you very much."
"LORELAI: Uh, Kirk, I have made up my mind."
"KIRK: You have?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"KIRK: Already?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"KIRK: And it's fully formed?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"KIRK: You don't need any other information?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't."
"KIRK: Cause I could have my mother call you if "
"LORELAI: Totally unnecessary."
"KIRK: Okay, well, then, go ahead."
"LORELAI: I just got out of a really weird relationship, and I know that sounds like a line, but it isn't. I'm just not. . .fully over the shock of it yet, and I never wanna hurt you because you're my friend and I like you, so I have to say no. I'm sorry."
"KIRK: Was the tuna inquiry too personal?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I thought it was very thoughtful"
"KIRK: You're sure you won't feel like it anytime soon?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'm sure."
"KIRK: Well, at least I asked. Goodnight Lorelai."
"CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Rory walks into an aisle and sees Jess]"
"JESS: Doing a little shopping?"
"RORY: Yes. Excuse me."
"JESS: Why the cold shoulder?"
"RORY: No cold shoulder. I just have perishables here."
"JESS: Oh yeah, you wanna get home before that beefaroni goes bad."
"RORY: My mom's waiting for me."
"JESS: How was Washington?"
"RORY: Fine."
"JESS: Do anything interesting?"
"RORY: Nope."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: What about you?"
"JESS: What about me?"
"RORY: Anything interesting happen? This summer, I mean."
"JESS: Nope."
"RORY: Really?"
"JESS: Really."
"RORY: So nothing happened this summer, at all?"
"JESS: It was hot. Two weeks ago there was a run on snowcones. Machine broke, people went crazy, Taylor tried to call in the National Guard, but "
"RORY: I'm not talking about snowcones."
"JESS: What are you talking about then?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"JESS: Her name's Shane."
"RORY: As in come back'?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: Well, great. That's great. Really, it's great."
"JESS: So I've heard."
"RORY: Well, it is."
"JESS: Are you upset about something?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: I mean, me and Shane "
"RORY: What about you and Shane?"
"JESS: I don't know, it didn't exactly bring a smile to your face."
"RORY: Well, I'm still freaked out about the, uh, snowcone machine."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: I could care less about you and Shane."
"JESS: Good."
"RORY: It just surprised me, that's all."
"JESS: Why?"
"RORY: Because."
"JESS: Because why?"
"RORY: Because of what happened at Sookie's wedding."
"JESS: Ah."
"RORY: Yeah, so me coming back here and just seeing you with Shane just kind of threw me for a sec."
"JESS: I'm sorry, did I hear from you at all this summer? Did I just happen to miss the thousands of phone calls you made to me, or did the postman happen to lose all those letters you wrote to me? You kiss me, you tell me not to say anything. . .very flattering, by the way. You go off to Washington. . . then nothing. Then you come back here all put out because I didn't just sit around and wait for you like Dean would've done? And yeah, what about Dean? Are you still with him? 'Cause last time I checked, you were, and I haven't heard anything to the contrary. Plus, the two of you walking around the other day like some damn Andy Hardy movie. Seemed to me like you're still pretty together. I half expected you to break into a barn and put on a show."
"RORY: When did you see me with Dean?"
"JESS: At that stupid summer insanity plea the town put on."
"RORY: Oh, I'm surprised you could see anything with Shane's head plastered to your face."
"JESS: You didn't answer me."
"RORY: About what?"
"JESS: Did you call me at all?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Did you send me a letter?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Postcard?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Smoke signal?"
"RORY: Stop."
"JESS: A nice fruit basket?"
"RORY: Enough!"
"JESS: Are you still with Dean? Come on, Rory, yes or no  are you still with Dean?"
"RORY: Yes, I'm still with Dean, yes!"
"JESS: Glad to hear it."
"RORY: Glad to tell you."
"JESS: See you around."
"RORY: Whatever."
"JESS: Right back at ya."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory walks out of the market with a bag of groceries]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I was just gonna come in after you. You all done?"
"RORY: Oh yeah, I'm done."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are on the sofa watching ""The Brady Bunch Variety Hour""]"
"RORY: This is sublime."
"LORELAI: It was the golden age of television."
"RORY: The music, the costumes, the sets."
"LORELAI: All cylinders were fired on this one, boy!"
"RORY: And who knew that they all had such musical talent?"
"LORELAI: And such far out booty shaking abilities, as well."
"[The mailman walks through the front door and sets the mail on the bench]"
"EDDIE: Mail, ladies."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Eddie!"
"[Eddie walks back out; Rory walks over to get the mail]"
"RORY: Did you see that TV Guide had this on their list of the worst fifty shows of all time?"
"LORELAI: I know! Who are they to judge?"
"RORY: I know, it's on my top fifty best."
"LORELAI: Yeah, right after ""Holmes and Yoyo"" and ""Hee Haw Honeys."" Oh, Rory, get back here! They're in clown suits and headed for the pool."
"RORY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Honey, come here."
"RORY: It's here."
"LORELAI: What's here?"
"RORY: My application to Harvard."
"LORELAI: Oh my God. [walks over to look at it] It's beautiful."
"RORY: Impressive letterage, huh?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, it's so. . ."
"RORY: Very."
"LORELAI: Can I hold it?"
"RORY: Be careful."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's heavy, heavy with importance."
"RORY: I feel dizzy."
"LORELAI: Are you sure that's not just the sight of Robert Reed in the tight clown pants?"
"RORY: Oh, geez. Let the record show that when my application to Harvard arrived, we were watching ""The Brady Bunch Variety Hour."""
"LORELAI: You don't lose points for that, do you?"
"RORY: I hope not. Man, this morning I was reading Dead Souls  it couldn't have come then?"
"LORELAI: Well, we'll just tell people that's what you were doing, and that I was studying a really big globe. They'll never know."
"RORY: You can keep a secret?"
"LORELAI: Not so far, but there's always a first."
"RORY: Dead Souls and a really big globe."
"LORELAI: Deal. [looks at TV] Oh, kayaks!"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai sits at the table with the Harvard application while Rory gets a drink from the refrigerator]"
"LORELAI: Come on, come on, I wanna get started."
"RORY: Hold your horses there little Miss Horsie Holder."
"LORELAI: They're going to expect a higher level of wit when you're at Harvard. Oh, watch that drink."
"RORY: I'm nowhere near it."
"LORELAI: Well, keep it that way. This is an uncontaminated area. I even cleaned the table using something other than the sleeve of my sweater and spit. [shows her a bottle of cleanser]"
"RORY: Lovely image. I'll be careful."
"LORELAI: All right, here we go. First question. Uh! Oh my God."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: ""What were you doing the moment you received this application?"" counts for fifty percent of your eligibility."
"RORY: Stop."
"[Lane walks out of Rory's bedroom]"
"LANE: I need help."
"LORELAI: With what?"
"RORY: She's writing her drummer-seeks-rock-band ad."
"LANE: And it's not reading right to me. Could you guys look it over?"
"RORY: Let's see  ""Drummer with strong b*at seeks band into the Accelerators, the Adolescents, the Adverts, Agent Orange, the Angelic Upstarts, the Agnostic Front, Ash. . ."" You went alphabetically."
"LANE: Seemed tidy."
"LORELAI: And a little OCD."
"RORY: And a little long."
"LANE: I can't make cuts."
"RORY: It's three pages, single spaced  make cuts."
"LANE: But this is the cut-down version. I mean, just from the letter A, I excluded AC/DC, the Animals, and A-Ha, footnoted as a guilty pleasure."
"RORY: If we can't get through it, no one can."
"LANE: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"LANE: I'll try to make cuts, but no guarantees. [goes back into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Okay, personal information. . . state your full name. Better not get that one wrong."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: And nickname, if any."
"RORY: That would be Rory."
"LORELAI: Or Droopy Drawers."
"RORY: That was never my nickname."
"LORELAI: Wrong, I called you that as a baby."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: That's right. You had these little OshKosh cords and they were way too big and once at the mall, they fell right down to your knees and I said, ""Whoa, there, Droopy Drawers!""  and I'm just afraid if we don't answer everything accurately, the Harvard police will come and hit you with an atlas and say something mean in Latin."
"RORY: How would they know that you called me Droopy Drawers?"
"LORELAI: Well, we could be at a Harvard event and I could slip up and say, ""Pass me a lobster puff, Droopy Drawers,"" and they could hear me, and that'll be that."
"RORY: How bout you don't drink at any of these Harvard events?"
"LORELAI: Okay, parental information. Mother  breathtaking."
"RORY: I think they just want your name."
"LORELAI: Father  ostracized. Personal statement."
"RORY: Oh, the essay  the big kahuna."
"LORELAI: You can evaluate a significant experience that's had an impact on you. How bout that time your drawers dropped at the mall?"
"RORY: Enough with the drawers."
"LORELAI: Or you can write about a person who has had a significant influence on you."
"RORY: You?"
"LORELAI: Or one of your authors, Faulkner or. . ."
"RORY: Or Sylvia Plath."
"LORELAI: Hm, might send the wrong message."
"RORY: The sticking her head in the oven thing?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Although she did make her kids a snack first, shows a certain maternal instinct."
"[Lane walks out of Rory's bedroom]"
"LANE: Okay, I just crunched the numbers and at two thousand words and twenty-five cents a word, this stupid ad's gonna cost five hundred dollars! That's five months worth of Minwaxing end tables at my mom's store. I give up."
"RORY: No, don't give up. Just cut down your influences to the most important ones, like with David Bowie."
"LANE: Gotta have Bowie."
"RORY: But do you have to list every album he ever recorded plus your personal rating between one to ten?"
"LANE: Maybe not."
"LORELAI: And what's with Jackson Browne making the list?"
"LANE: Ah, see, cool people know that he's more than a mellow hippie-dippy folkie, that he actually wrote some of Nico's best songs and was in fact her lover before he bored us with ""Doctor My Eyes."" That will separate the poseurs from the non-poseurs."
"RORY: Wax on, wax off."
"LANE: I hate this. [goes back into bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Okay, what activities interest you?"
"RORY: All of them except for the sports."
"LORELAI: I thought you were the lacrosse kid."
"RORY: Mom, just a modicum of seriousness as we do this would be much appreciated."
"LORELAI: Hm, so, circle all of them except sports. Oh, they want a picture. How about the one of us sticking our heads through the carved out holes of Johnny Bravo and SpongeBob Squarepants?"
"RORY: There's the seriousness I crave."
"[Lane opens the bedroom door]"
"LANE: I'm going to have to crank the Ramones if I have to make deep cuts."
"[Lane shuts the door, and a second later, music starts blaring from the room]"
"RORY: We'll move outside."
"LORELAI: The outside's contaminated."
"[Rory grabs the bottle of cleanser and they walk out the back door]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Dean and Rory are sitting at a table. Luke refills Rory's coffee mug]"
"RORY: Thank you."
"LUKE: Do they let kids drink coffee before school?"
"RORY: Why, do you think it might lead to harder stuff? Lattes, cappucinos. . ."
"LUKE: Forget I asked. [walks away]"
"RORY: So, what are you doing Saturday?"
"DEAN: Just my usual chores."
"RORY: Your usual chores, John-boy?"
"DEAN: Well, what else do you call house jobs?"
"RORY: I call them the stuff you avoid until the Environmental Protection Agency steps in."
"DEAN: Why do you ask?"
"RORY: I thought we could see a movie or something."
"DEAN: You're not free."
"RORY: How do you know?"
"DEAN: Cause you'll be working on your application all weekend."
"RORY: No, I'm not."
"DEAN: Really?"
"RORY: It's not due for weeks, and I already have my essay topic picked out."
"DEAN: Which is?"
"RORY: Hillary Clinton."
"DEAN: Sounds perfect."
"RORY: I know. She's so smart and tough and nobody thought she could win New York but she did and she's doing amazing, and have you heard her speak?"
"DEAN: Only when you've played me the thousands of hours of C-SPAN footage you taped."
"RORY: She's a great speaker, strong and persuasive with a wonderful presence, and even those suits of hers are getting better."
"DEAN: I'd include that in the essay."
"RORY: Anyhow, now that I have Hillary, all I need is a date for Saturday. Suggestions?"
"DEAN: You're on."
"RORY: Great. Oh, there's my bus. Sip. [sips coffee] Kiss. [they kiss] And bye."
"DEAN: Bye."
"[Rory exits the diner and runs to catch her bus as Luke walks over to the table]"
"LUKE: Fast runner."
"DEAN: It's the coffee."
"LUKE: Not your face?"
"DEAN: Excuse me?"
"LUKE: Sorry, just missed my youth for a second. I'm back. Coffee?"
"[Luke looks out the window and sees Taylor taking photographs of the store next to the diner]"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory is waiting outside the auditorium while Paris argues with a teacher]"
"PARIS: Everyone always says that! This is my speaking voice. This is its natural volume! Fine, fine! [walks over to Rory and they walk into the auditorium]"
"PARIS: Short-sighted morons."
"RORY: What now, Paris?"
"PARIS: We went to all this trouble to set up this stupid seminar. I say we, but let's face it, I did most of the work, and Mr. Hunter won't let me do it the way I want."
"RORY: The panelists are up there. We sit across from them and ask questions. What's the problem?"
"PARIS: It's boring and predictable and done to death. I wanted Charlie Rose."
"RORY: To ask the questions?"
"PARIS: His style. I wanted us sitting at a round table with black backdrops."
"RORY: But the audience won't be able to see anything."
"PARIS: I was working with the losers in the AV club to project it on a giant video screen. And all Mr. Hunter said was, ""Paris, this isn't the b*at at Shea Stadium."" Nice anachronism, huh? Like they had video screens in sixty-three. His references are as topical as his suits."
"MR. HUNTER: [on stage] Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please? We can get this seminar started. I'd like to bring up the organizers of this little event, Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore."
"[There are two tables on the stage. A man and a woman are seated at one of them; Rory and Paris walk on stage and sit at the other]"
"PARIS: Thank you, Mr. Hunter. Everybody, this is a seminar called ""The Business of Getting In."" Its goal is to help guide us through the torturous process of applying to, and getting into, the right college. My panelists are Jim Romaine, admissions officer at Princeton University, and Ivy-League college consultant, Rose Samuels. Welcome, panel."
"RORY: Yes, welcome."
"PARIS: Now, panel, you're addressing a group of kids just beginning the stressful process of applying to college. Question  what is the biggest mistake a person can make on his or her application? Mr. Romaine?"
"MR. ROMAINE: Well, forgetting to send it in would be the worst mistake, but perfunctory answers would be high on my list."
"PARIS: Explain."
"MR. ROMAINE: I'm talking about run of the mill responses, a lack of originality, particularly in the essay category. If I read one more over-adulating piece of prose about Hillary Clinton and her profound influence, my head will explode."
"MS. SAMUELS: I hear that. Sometimes a mistake like that comes from writing what one thinks an admission officer wants to read."
"MR. ROMAINE: Big mistake."
"MS. SAMUELS: And sometimes it's just a lack of original thought."
"MR. ROMAINE: Just as big a mistake."
"PARIS: Personal anecdote  when I was twelve and I was writing the first of my trial essays in practice for the day I'd write my real essay, I chose Hillary Clinton. Then I realized every braindead bint in a skirt would be writing about Hillary, but it was good to clear the pipes. Now, what are some other mistakes?"
"MR. ROMAINE: Well, small thing, but if your printing is bad, that says something we don't like. If your extracurriculars and volunteer activities are too by-the-book, that says something we don't like."
"MS. SAMUELS: Yes, those activities should have a personality behind them  a focus, a direction. I've seen applications where the student has circled every activity listed. Again, you're trying too hard there. One can't be interested in everything."
"MR. ROMAINE: They're the ones who've had college paraphernalia on their walls their whole lives."
"MS. SAMUELS: Too hungry, it's a little immature."
"PARIS: Interesting, interesting. Rory, do you wanna ask a question?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: No, thank you."
"PARIS: Okay. So, how early should a student get an application in?"
"MR. ROMAINE: By the due date. Earlier makes no difference. It's a complete myth that there's a benefit to be derived from early admission. I do think it's important to talk about the interview process. I believe it's an opportunity to weed out the hyper-intense candidate. . ."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Emily walk into the living room]"
"EMILY: So, she's meeting you here?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she had a thing after school, a rumble or something. She said she'd be over after."
"EMILY: A rumble?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, a bunch of kids meet in an alley, they pirouette, they pull knives, it's a whole to-do."
"EMILY: So she's meeting you here?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she's meeting us here. Where's Dad?"
"EMILY: The magazines. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: That was weird. . .and unresponsive."
"[Lorelai walks over to the couch as Emily returns with a stack of magazines]"
"EMILY: These are college issues of various magazines. I've been collecting them for a couple of months now."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, Rory's probably seen all those, but thanks anyway."
"EMILY: Have you read these?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Well, you should. I've unearthed some shocking statistics. I mean, do you have any idea how hot the competition is to get into a school like Harvard?"
"LORELAI: Well, yeah, it's very hot. It's one of the top schools in the country."
"EMILY: In the world. People from China, Russia, India, children from every country apply to Harvard. There's more competition than ever before."
"LORELAI: Really, Mom, I know all this."
"EMILY: With the dot-com bust and the job market dwindling and the stock market going up and down like a yo-yo, everyone and his brother knows the best chance for success and financial security is not just to go to college, but to go to a top college."
"LORELAI: Thank you, got it, appreciate the info."
"EMILY: Every child that applies has the same high grade point average, they've taken the same AP classes, and they're all on the student council."
"LORELAI: They're not all that identical."
"EMILY: One college admissions officer said that he sometimes puts a random stack of applications in the yes pile and the rest in the no pile because he knows it doesn't make any difference. He doesn't even so much as glance at them."
"LORELAI: That does not sound real."
"EMILY: And now it's the in thing for young Hollywood celebrities to go to universities. What do they call themselves, the Brat Pack?"
"LORELAI: About a hundred years ago."
"EMILY: They get into wherever they want based on name recognition. I was watching TV and that insipid Kate Hudson was talking about going to a university. If she decides to go to Harvard, she'll get right in over Rory, who we know is more qualified."
"LORELAI: How bout a drink, Mom? You want a drink, cause I sure do."
"EMILY: Lorelai, hold on here. What are we gonna do about this?"
"LORELAI: Look, there is no we, okay? It's me  me and Rory  that's the we. I appreciate your concern and your prodigious research, but it's all gonna be fine. Rory's special."
"EMILY: Well, you know that and I know that but those idiots at Harvard may not necessarily know that."
"RORY: [calls from hallway] Hello?"
"LORELAI: Uh, we're in here, honey, and hurry!"
"[Rory walks into the living room]"
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: Hello Rory. You look flushed."
"RORY: I ran from the bus stop, I'm okay. Mom, hey, I've been trying to call you  can I talk to you for a second?"
"EMILY: Is something wrong?"
"RORY: No, I just need to talk to Mom about something, that's all. We'll be quick."
"LORELAI: Okay, hon. We'll be back."
"CUT TO RICHARD'S STUDY"
"[Rory and Lorelai walk in]"
"RORY: I'm not getting into Harvard."
"LORELAI: What? Who says?"
"RORY: Well, I'm completely unprepared, and I have no original thoughts!"
"LORELAI: No, no, don't blame yourself, it's not you. It's those jerks at Harvard  I hate them!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, apparently, it doesn't matter how qualified you are, those lazy-ass admissions officers just take applications and stick it in the yes and no piles without even glancing at them!"
"RORY: Well, it won't matter because my Hillary Clinton essay will be just like every other girl's Hillary Clinton essay because apparently that's all we can think of. I'm such a hack."
"LORELAI: Is it true everyone has the same GPA? How is that possible?"
"RORY: Because we all take the same classes and we all give the same perfunctory run-of-the-mill responses. And I'm interested in too many things, I have to limit them. I'm gonna circle travel on my application. From now on, that is what I am interested in, travel."
"LORELAI: No, no, don't do that, no! Because all those people coming from China and India and God knows where else, they're all nuts for traveling  that's why they're traveling here! Andand jobs are dropping and dot-com b*mb and something's acting like a yo-yo, I don't know what but it's not good! And over my dead body is Kate Hudson getting your spot, let me just say that right now!"
"RORY: Mom, you're freaking out!"
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm freaking out!"
"RORY: Well, you can't freak out, I'm freaking out! [cell phone rings] Hello?"
"PARIS: What the hell did Romaine mean when he was going on about weeding out the hyper-intense in the interview process? He stopped just short of calling me by name, I'm losing it!"
"RORY: Not now, Paris."
"PARIS: I tried to throw the questioning over to you because I was about to heave and you left me hanging so I had to come home and heave."
"RORY: I'll talk to you tomorrow, Paris. [hangs up]"
"PARIS: Wait!"
"LORELAI: Okay, we gotta calm down here."
"RORY: So, set an example."
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm human, too."
"RORY: My forehead is burning up."
"LORELAI: My heart is b*at so fast, it's gotta slow down."
"RORY: Okay, just. . .let's take a breath."
"LORELAI: Okay. This freaking out is not good."
"RORY: It sucks."
"LORELAI: We can do this. If others can do this, we can do this!"
"RORY: Well, I'm not so sure anymore."
"LORELAI: That is unacceptable!"
"RORY: Well, I don't wanna accept it."
"LORELAI: Then we won't."
"RORY: Well, what do we do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. We definitely need some sort of perspective."
"RORY: I think we need therapy."
"LORELAI: And booze! For those of us over twenty-one. Okay, are we calming? Are we less-freaked?"
"RORY: I'm totally freaked out."
"LORELAI: Well, hide it!"
"RORY: I can't hide it."
"LORELAI: Then prepare yourself for an evening of magazine recitations by Emily ""DJ Doom-meister"" Gilmore."
"RORY: I'll hide it."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is making coffee in the kitchen when the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello? . . . No, Lane should be here any minute. Is this about the ad? . . . Well, uh, give me your number and she'll call you back. . . Okay, then, what's the number of the dude whose couch you're sleeping on? . . .Uh! Dude doesn't have a phone? Well, try back later, dude. Thanks. [hangs up] Rory, are you up? If not, get up! [phone rings again] And where's Lane? She's supposed to be fielding these. [answers phone] Hello? No, she's not, may I take a message? [Lane walks in through the back door] Oh, wait a minute  here she is, hold on. [holds out the phone toward Lane]"
"LANE: Sorry. [answers phone] This is Lane. [walks out of kitchen]"
"[Rory walks out of her bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Aw, what's up?"
"RORY: I didn't sleep so well."
"LORELAI: Poor thing."
"RORY: I'm fine. I'm just a little bummed."
"LANE: [on phone] No, wait, wait, wait, progressive rock is a really passé style now but I listed it as an influence because it was a progenitor of great things that came afterwards. I mean, I contend that you can draw a straight line from Yes to Jethro Tull to the Jam to Nirvana, bing bang boom. . . Who are the Jam? [to Rory and Lorelai] That's disturbing. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Hey, maybe instead of going to college, you should drop out and I could quit my job and we can form an all-girl band with Lane, you know, like Bananarama. We could call it Tangerinarama or Banana-fana-fo-fana-rama. . .or something. Honey, I'm just kidding, you gotta go to college."
"RORY: I'm up for anything at this point. I gotta go. I'll see you later?"
"LORELAI: Feel better, okay?"
"RORY: I will."
"LANE: You are not telling me that you did not know that Kim Deal was in the Pixies before the Breeders! I refuse to accept that! [hangs up] These kids have no sense of history."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke walks up to a customer at the counter]"
"LUKE: Hey Tom, what's up?"
"TOM: Nothing much. Why don't you get me a ham on rye, mustard, no mayo."
"LUKE: You got it."
"[A young boy walks up to the counter]"
"BOY: Hi."
"LUKE: You got money?"
"BOY: Yes, sir."
"LUKE: What can I get ya?"
"BOY: Let's see. How about a nice, cold egg cream?"
"LUKE: A what cream?"
"BOY: An egg cream. A nice and cold one."
"LUKE: What is that?"
"TOM: It's like, uh, milk and soda water with flavoring, isn't it?"
"LUKE: You asking me?"
"BOY: Nice and cold."
"LUKE: I heard that part."
"TOM: Used to get them at Coney Island."
"LUKE: Go to Coney Island, kid."
"[The boy leaves, and another boy walks up to the counter]"
"BOY: Sir, can I get something to go?"
"LUKE: You got money?"
"BOY: Uh huh."
"LUKE: What do you want?"
"BOY: A black cow."
"LUKE: Aw, now, come on."
"BOY: It's just root beer and ice cream."
"LUKE: Root beer and ice cream?"
"BOY: Uh huh."
"LUKE: Well, I can do that."
"BOY: As long as the ice cream's made the old fashioned way  on the premises."
"LUKE: Now wait a second."
"[Kirk walks up to the counter]"
"KIRK: Hey, Luke, can you whip me up something in a hurry?"
"LUKE: What, Kirk?"
"KIRK: A chocolate phosphate."
"LUKE: Okay, now, what the hell is this? Why do you want a phosphate?"
"KIRK: Because nothing says refreshment like a phosphate."
"LUKE: This is Taylor, right? Is he behind this?"
"KIRK: I'm not at liberty to say."
"LUKE: [to boy] Okay, then, you tell me. And remember, if you lie, you'll go to hell."
"BOY: He didn't say you'd get mad."
"LUKE: Come on."
"[Luke drags Kirk and the boy out of the diner]"
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Luke pulls Kirk and the boy into the market]"
"TAYLOR: What is this?"
"LUKE: That's my question. Now what the hell's going on here?"
"TAYLOR: I have no idea what you're talking about."
"LUKE: They're asking for phosphates and egg creams and black cows, and they already gave you up, so tell me what's going on."
"TAYLOR: Who finked?"
"KIRK: Him, him."
"BOY: Snitch!"
"KIRK: Well, you did."
"LUKE: It's not the kid's fault, Taylor. Now what is this about?"
"TAYLOR: Well, you are so close-minded to new things, Luke, that I decided to make an admittedly desperate attempt to convince you of the need for something that I think is a terrific idea."
"LUKE: Which is?"
"TAYLOR: An old fashioned, turn of the century soda shop!"
"LUKE: Aye yi yi yi yi!"
"TAYLOR: It's just the kind of wholesome hang today's teens need to keep them off the streets."
"LUKE: And our streets are so wild and out of control?"
"TAYLOR: If you ask me, yes  and I have proof. [hands Luke an envelope of pictures]"
"LUKE: What are these?"
"TAYLOR: Surveillance photos of town goings-on, the dark side of Stars Hollow, Luke  not a pretty picture."
"LUKE: These are kids on skateboards."
"TAYLOR: Slaloming around pop bottles right down the middle of the street. I'm telling you, Luke, if we don't quick furnish these skateboarding z-boys with a moral distraction, they're gonna turn Stars Hollow into Dogtown."
"LUKE: [points to a picture] This is the space next to the diner."
"TAYLOR: I know."
"LUKE: I own the space next to the diner."
"TAYLOR: I know."
"LUKE: You wanna open the soda shop in the space next to the diner?"
"TAYLOR: It's the only one that's appropriate."
"LUKE: Taylor, no, no, no, no, and every day from now on til the end of my life, I am gonna come in here and say, ""Taylor, no!"" And when I die, I'm gonna have them freeze me next to Ted Williams, and when they find the cure to what I died of and they unfreeze me, my first words are gonna be, ""How's Ted?"" followed closely by, ""Taylor, no!"""
"TAYLOR: But the space is empty!"
"LUKE: Not for long."
"TAYLOR: And what are your plans for it?"
"LUKE: A skateboard and pop bottle shop."
"TAYLOR: That's not funny."
"LUKE: With in-house experts to teach the craft of street slaloming."
"TAYLOR: Still not funny."
"LUKE: Well, I'm not in a very funny mood!"
"KIRK: Luke, are you taking applications for jobs at your skateboard and bottle shop?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm interviewing people today, Kirk."
"KIRK: Great. Shall I go home and change or will casual suffice?"
"LUKE: I like the going home part."
"KIRK: I don't understand."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch when Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey. Guess who I actually had a very productive conversation with today? Headmaster Charleston."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: No, and I think we came up with the solution to our application anxiety, you wanna hear it?"
"RORY: I guess."
"LORELAI: Well, we spent the first ten minutes on him bugging me to volunteer for more stuff at school, or in lieu of that to make a donation to build the new basketball court, and then another couple of minutes of me convincing him that what sounded like me going ""Ha!"" was really me clearing my throat, but after that we had a very pleasant, productive conversation."
"RORY: And?"
"LORELAI: He suggested setting up a meeting with a Harvard graduate, like a dinner or something. He even gave me the number of someone he knows."
"RORY: An alumni dinner?"
"LORELAI: Yes, exactly."
"RORY: Do they do that?"
"LORELAI: According to Charleston, it's done all the time."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it would be an opportunity to talk with someone who's been through it all and did it successfully. You can ask questions, he can give some perspective, it seems perfect."
"RORY: It sounds a little weird."
"LORELAI: Yeah, a little, but I'll go with you and what's the worst that can happen? We're bored and we blow a meal, but if this person can help, then that's a good thing, right?"
"RORY: I do have some questions. . . a lot of questions."
"LORELAI: Well, let's call him."
"RORY: Now?"
"LORELAI: Yes, yes, there's no time like the present, come on. [they walk over to desk] His name is Darren Springsteen of Westport, Connecticut, Harvard class of 74. Uh! Ask if he has a brother named Bruce."
"RORY: I'm not gonna ask him that. [dials phone number] It's ringing."
"LORELAI: Hee!"
"[Rory hangs up the phone]"
"LORELAI: Why'd you hang up?"
"RORY: I'm not good at these things."
"LORELAI: Did he answer?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes? Rory, that's a really terrible first impression. [phone rings] Uh oh."
"RORY: Him?"
"LORELAI: Maybe."
"RORY: He star sixty-nined us?"
"LORELAI: Well, the Harvard people can afford all the latest technology. Answer!"
"LORELAI: [on answering machine] Hey, you've reached Suffragette City, and if you're calling about Lane Kim's ad, sorry we're not in, but don't commit rock and roll su1c1de  just crank a message with some feedback."
"RORY: Oh geez."
"LORELAI: Well, if he is related to Bruce, he can dig it."
"DAVE: [on machine] Hey, my name's Dave Rygalski, I'm calling about the ad. I left my number before, so call when you get a chance."
"GIRL: [in background on machine] Where's my "
"DAVE: [on machine] Relax, I'm coming."
"[Lorelai stops the message]"
"LORELAI: Let's try this again. [dials number]"
"RORY: Can we please just do this later?"
"LORELAI: No, let's get it done now. It's ringing."
"RORY: Let's do it later."
"LORELAI: It's ringing. [hands her the phone]"
"RORY: I'm gonna say the wrong thing or have the wrong tone in my voice. I'm not in good first impression mode right now. [hands phone back to Lorelai] Unh!"
"LORELAI: [answers phone in high voice] Hello? Hello, um, this is Rory Gilmore. I believe you were expecting my call. . .Um, oh, well, this is such a wonderful opportunity for me. . .Whatever's good for you will be great for me. . ."
"RORY: Not so breathy."
"LORELAI: That's how chickens talk! [on phone in high voice] Lunch? Oh yes, let me just check my organizer. . .oh, perfect. My mother will be there, too. She's terrific. . . All right, I'll see you this weekend. . . Mm, bye. [hangs up]"
"RORY: You're no Danny Gans."
"LORELAI: I never claimed to be."
"RORY: He's gonna be expecting Chilton High School senior Trixie McBimbo."
"LORELAI: And her mother, Bambi McBimbo."
"RORY: But I guess it can't hurt, right?"
"LORELAI: It can only help."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: And look, if it's a total bust, we'll grab a pole and Trixie and Bambi'll take it on the road. That's something to put on your application, huh? It'll set you apart."
"RORY: Thanks Mom."
"LORELAI: [in high voice] Bye Trixie!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE SPRINGSTEEN RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up the pathway to the house]"
"LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: And alumnus is a man."
"RORY: Singular."
"LORELAI: So an unmarried man?"
"RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural."
"LORELAI: And plural is alumni."
"RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys."
"LORELAI: Kinky!"
"RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. [rings doorbell]"
"LORELAI: Ugh, you're no fun when you're nervous."
"RORY: Oh yes, because you and I usually have so much fun with Latin."
"LORELAI: So what do we call this guy, alumnus Darren, you know, like you'd say farmer John or the butcher Lazar Wolf?"
"RORY: Hish-kabibble."
"[A man opens the door]"
"DARREN: Hello there."
"LORELAI: Hello, I'm Lorelai Gilmore."
"DARREN: Darren Springsteen, nice to meet you. And this must be the reason we're all here."
"RORY: Yes, hello. I'm hope we're not putting you out."
"DARREN: Putting us out? Today you are the Springsteen family's raison d'être. Come in, come in. [they walk inside] Was your drive long?"
"LORELAI: Not too."
"DARREN: Stars Hollow is charming. The last time we drove through there, there was a pumpkin patch."
"LORELAI: Sounds like us."
"DARREN: In March."
"LORELAI: Oh, that would be the year the pumpkins arrived late."
"DARREN: Sounds like a Dr. Seuss book. You came bearing gifts?"
"RORY: What? Oh, this. No, this is not a gift. These are my records  grades, SATs."
"LORELAI: It's Rory in a bag  you add water and her brilliance springs out."
"DARREN: Why don't I just glance at this some other time, mm? This afternoon, why don't we just talk and get to know one another, okay?"
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: You're a very nice alumni."
"DARREN: Thanks. [walks down the hall]"
"RORY: That's the plural."
"LORELAI: Ah, rats!"
"[they follow him into the living room]"
"DARREN: Lorelai, Rory, say hello to Marie, my wife."
"MARIE: Hello, so good to have you here."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Thank you."
"MARIE: How about drinks? Iced tea, water?"
"RORY: Iced tea's good."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"MARIE: Okay. [leaves room]"
"DARREN: Do you like art, Rory?"
"RORY: Very much."
"DARREN: Modern painting is my passion. I've got a Hockney, a Kline  what I don't have is a Diebenkorn so please don't ask, ""Where's the Diebenkorn?"""
"LORELAI: Uh, you warned me just in time."
"DARREN: I only recently got into sculpture. My latest acquisition, it's a Zoltan Kemeny. Very provocative. Don't you just love its audacity?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it's very audacious."
"DARREN: So, what are some of your other interests, Rory?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, pull up a comfy chair there, Darren, because they are widespread and extensive."
"RORY: I read a lot. I'm into the Russians lately."
"DARREN: Tolstoy, Turgenev?"
"RORY: Gogol is my thing right now  Dead Souls."
"DARREN: One of my favorites."
"LORELAI: You were reading that when we got your Harvard application in the mail, weren't you sweetie?"
"RORY: Yes, yes I was."
"LORELAI: I saw that Harvard logo on the envelope and I said, ""Rory, get your nose out of your Gogol and get over here!"" Of course, we have a TV somewhere, but it's really more of a funny little table to put a cup of chai tea on, you know what I mean?"
"DARREN: I'm afraid I don't. I watch way too many sports, and I go to all the Harvard games. How about you  do you like sports?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: That is, we follow certain things."
"RORY: We enjoy various aspects of certain sporting endeavors."
"LORELAI: But it wouldn't be the kind that you could ask any follow-up questions on."
"RORY: It's a general interest."
"DARREN: Got it. It's pretty much a waste of time, but it's how I waste my time. I collect memorabilia, too. I've got each year's Harvard team pennant going back to 1927."
"LORELAI: Lots of displayed Harvard paraphernalia, huh?"
"DARREN: It's all over the walls at the rec room."
"LORELAI: See, see, lots of paraphernalia."
"RORY: Watch the ribs there."
"[Two kids walk in from the backyard]"
"DARREN: Ah, here are the kids. Jack, Jennifer, this is Lorelai and Rory."
"JACK: Hi there."
"JENNIFER: It's nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Likewise."
"RORY: Hi."
"DARREN: Jack's premed at Princeton and Jennifer is bound for Harvard like you Rory."
"JENNIFER: Oh, we should talk."
"RORY: Sure."
"JENNIFER: If not today, another day, okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"JENNIFER: Uh, do you wanna pick a time now or later. . ."
"RORY: Later's fine."
"JENNIFER: I'll make a note in my palm pilot."
"RORY: Cool."
"MARIE: [enters room with a tray of drinks] Here are your teas."
"RORY: Thank you."
"MARIE: Ah, Darren, we should really get the chicken going."
"DARREN: Right, right. You're getting my famous chicken today  I hope you like chicken."
"RORY: Love it."
"DARREN: I'll be right back. Here's some of my Harvard yearbooks, peruse them if you like."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"[Marie and Darren leave the room]"
"JACK: Yeah, and we should go clean up, Jen."
"JENNIFER: Mm, definitely. [to Rory] I will see you in a jiff."
"[Jack and Jennifer leave the room]"
"LORELAI: Ew!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Did they just leave to take a shower together?"
"RORY: Oh, gross!"
"LORELAI: What? They bounced in together, they bounced out together."
"RORY: New topic."
"LORELAI: Can't take gritty reality?"
"RORY: Or slanderous postulating."
"LORELAI: And how is it they just came off the tennis court and they're not even sweating?"
"RORY: I don't know. Maybe when you're that white, you don't sweat."
"LORELAI: Darren's nice though, isn't he?"
"RORY: He's very nice. Hey, do you think I'm making a good impression?"
"LORELAI: Great impression. He loves you, especially when he found out you share his love of various aspects of certain sporting endeavors."
"RORY: Hey, you started it. We could have just told the truth and said we weren't into sports."
"LORELAI: I was trying to humanize us."
"RORY: Yeah, with our funny looking chai tea table. Very humanizing."
"LORELAI: [in robot voice] Zoltan Kemeny."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: That artist's name  it sounds like robot language, doesn't it? Zoltan Kemeny."
"RORY: Don't say it again."
"LORELAI: Zoltan Kemeny, Zoltan Kemeny."
"RORY: Stop, don't!"
"LORELAI: Zoltaaaan "
"MARIE: [enters room] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm interrupting the fun."
"LORELAI: No, that's all right, you're not. We were just laughing at all the funny haircuts, that's all."
"MARIE: I know, aren't they a blast?"
"LORELAI: It's just a sea of goofy sideburns."
"MARIE: Lunch will be ready in just a few minutes. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Zoltan."
"RORY: Stop!"
""
""

"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Marie and Darren walk into the room]"
"LORELAI: Aw, wow, what a beautiful table."
"RORY: Yes, you didn't have to do that."
"DARREN: Oh, Rory, honestly, it's our pleasure."
"[Jack and Jennifer walk in wearing similar outfits]"
"DARREN: Perfect timing, kids."
"JACK: Excellent."
"JENNIFER: Nice looking lunch, Mom."
"LORELAI: [to Rory] Color coordinated."
"RORY: Shh!"
"DARREN: Guests of honor, why don't you sit over there."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Aw, family pictures. You have another girl, don't you?"
"MARIE: Yes, we do."
"LORELAI: Well, where is she? What does she do?"
"DARREN: Oh, um. . ."
"MARIE: She's not here."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked."
"DARREN: Oh, no no, it's all right. That's Carol. She's a year ahead of Rory. She's. . ."
"MARIE: She's following her own path."
"DARREN: Right. Carol's doing her own thing."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"DARREN: Well, let's eat everybody. Honored guests, please choose from the chicken first."
"RORY: Thank you very much."
"DARREN: [to his kids] You two are gonna have to fight over the breast as you always do. So, Lorelai, what's your alma matter?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was too preoccupied to go to college, what with weighing a couple hundred pounds and having feet twice my normal size and all."
"DARREN: I see."
"RORY: But she took night classes and graduated last year. She has an AA degree in business."
"MARIE: Well, that's wonderful."
"DARREN: In fact, it's refreshing. It might even be to Rory's benefit. Good things didn't come to your family in one fell swoop, you struggled for it."
"LORELAI: That's true."
"DARREN: One fell swoop, interesting phrase."
"JACK: Very."
"DARREN: Origin?"
"JACK: It was coined in MacBeth and derives from Middle English."
"DARREN: Very good, son. You know your Shakespeare then, do you?"
"JACK: More than most."
"DARREN: In which play does Falstaff appear?"
"JACK: That would be plays."
"DARREN: Mm."
"JACK: Henry the Fourth, part one and two, and The Merry Wives of Windsor."
"DARREN: So that was a different Falstaff than Henry the Fifth?"
"JACK: Aw, sh**t!"
"DARREN: This is a little tradition with us, quizzes at meals. It keeps the Springsteens sharp."
"LORELAI: Very Kennedy-esque."
"JENNIFER: Mm, we love the Kennedys!"
"LORELAI: As do we all."
"DARREN: Now, the person questioned can challenge me with a follow-up if he gets his question right. Gets pretty competitive."
"LORELAI: Well, if p*stol are drawn, we're ducking."
"DARREN: Jack, which Polish composer "
"JACK: Chopin!"
"DARREN: Patience. . .became Prime Minister of his country?"
"JACK: Paderewski."
"DARREN: That's right, but your impetuousness cost you a follow-up. Jennifer, can you give me the three sub-classes of the Mesozoic Era?"
"JENNIFER: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous."
"DARREN: Good."
"JENNIFER: Follow-up  what preceded the Mesozoic Era?"
"DARREN: Paleozoic."
"LORELAI: He's good."
"MARIE: It's hard to stump Darren."
"JENNIFER: Impossible, he's brilliant."
"DARREN: Open question  which mythological figure has the head of a man, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion? Here's a hint  it's also the title of a novel by Robertson Davies."
"RORY: Oh, Manticore."
"DARREN: Very good, Rory."
"JACK: Yes, very good, Rory."
"JENNIFER: Yes, very good, Rory."
"MARIE: More water, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Please, thank you."
"DARREN: Do you know which French city famous for its water was the capital of collaborationist France?"
"LORELAI: Oh, me? Um, Evian, Perrier, uh, Le Crystal Geyser?"
"DARREN: Jennifer, you wanna help Lorelai out?"
"JENNIFER: Vichy."
"DARREN: That's correct."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's right. Vichy water, I knew that."
"DARREN: What about the year of Germany's victory in the Franco-Prussian w*r?"
"LORELAI: Huh, me again?"
"DARREN: If you wish."
"LORELAI: I don't know that one. I do know Instanbul is Constantinople, so if you've got a date in Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Instanbul."
"DARREN: That's true."
"RORY: You know, um, sorry to interrupt, but I'd like to wash my hands."
"DARREN: Our fault, we rushed you in here."
"MARIE: Our downstairs is being remodeled, you have to use upstairs. End of the hall."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Hurry back."
"RORY: I will. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: So, that painting there, wow. The colors are so great, I can't stop staring at it. It's just beautiful."
"DARREN: It is. It's by a student of Matisse. I think he caught the master's colors wonderfully."
"LORELAI: Oh, Matisse, love him."
"DARREN: I think only a charlatan wouldn't. Anyone know the artistic movement Matisse championed and referred to as the Wild Beast?"
"JENNIFER: Oh, fauvism!"
"DARREN: Correct."
"JENNIFER: Follow up?"
"DARREN: And then we'll go round robin."
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS"
"[Rory stops outside a bedroom when she hears music inside. A girl rushes past her and goes into the bedroom]"
"CAROL: Coming through!"
"RORY: Oh, sorry. I just heard music and . . . [follows her into the bedroom] Cool room."
"CAROL: Tom Waits."
"RORY: What?"
"CAROL: The music."
"RORY: Oh, I thought so. I love him."
"CAROL: I worship him. I even mildly stalked him once."
"RORY: Really?"
"CAROL: Last year, I heard he was staying at this hotel so I went there everyday and sat in the lobby drinking massive amounts of coffee waiting for him to walk by."
"RORY: Did you see him?"
"CAROL: Nope, never came down. For all I know, he's still there. Hand me that brush?"
"RORY: Oh, here."
"CAROL: Stupid manager made me cover for Fiona today. That girl's a major pie crust. Ears?"
"RORY: What?"
"CAROL: On the chair. What time is it?"
"RORY: Um, three. [hands her a pair of bunny ears]"
"CAROL: Oh, totally late for my next job. Oh well, guess Grandma had to take another trip to the emergency room, right? Are they on straight?"
"RORY: I think so."
"CAROL: Good. Who are you?"
"RORY: I'm sorry, I'm Rory Gilmore."
"CAROL: You're one of the Harvard bound?"
"RORY: Yeah. At least, I hope so."
"CAROL: [starts pulling on a bunny costume] Oh, trust me, you are. You've got that really good, straight, shiny Harvard hair. Zip me up?"
"RORY: I'm sorry, are you Carol?"
"CAROL: Yeah, why?"
"RORY: I don't know, I just didn't expect. . ."
"CAROL: What?"
"RORY: Well, you."
"CAROL: Why?"
"RORY: I don't know. Your parents just made it sound like. . ."
"CAROL: Like I was holed up in the Chelsea with a needle sticking out of my arm screaming Sid at the top of my lungs?"
"RORY: Kind of."
"CAROL: Well, to them, this is pretty close."
"RORY: Can I ask you what exactly you are dressing up like this for?"
"CAROL: Morgan Tanner's fourth birthday party."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"CAROL: Nope, this is my fifth birthday party this week. Great tips, all cash, and of course, there's cake."
"RORY: So you're a waitress and a birthday bunny and you go to school. That's pretty amazing."
"CAROL: I don't go to school."
"RORY: Oh, sorry, I just assumed. I mean, your family . . ."
"CAROL: My brother and sister got stuck on that conveyor belt. I, however, escaped somewhere around the eleventh grade, thank God."
"RORY: Huh."
"CAROL: Oh, hey, but no offense. I mean, that's just me. If you like being on the conveyor belt, then good for you."
"RORY: I'm not on the conveyor belt."
"CAROL: Okay."
"RORY: I'm not. I want this. I've dreamt of going to Harvard since I was a little girl."
"CAROL: Yeah, a lot of four year olds dream of that. It comes right after meeting Harry Potter."
"RORY: Hey, I am not gonna justify myself to someone with a tail."
"CAROL: You're right, I'm sorry. It's just that around here the Harvard brainwashing starts in the womb. If you were to tell either of my siblings that there was another life choice outside of the Ivy League, I think their khakis would wrinkle."
"RORY: Well, maybe they really want it."
"CAROL: Nope, my parents want it and they wanna please my parents. Have you seen a carrot?"
"RORY: Don't you wanna please your parents?"
"CAROL: Yeah, but not at the expense of finding myself."
"RORY: Or your carrot."
"CAROL: You gotta have your carrot. So, tell me something, Harvard hair  how bad do you wanna please your parents?"
"RORY: My mom, and really bad, but it's not hard to please my mom. She's okay with anything I do. As long as I'm happy, she's good."
"CAROL: You're sure?"
"RORY: I'm very sure."
"CAROL: Then you're lucky."
"RORY: Yeah, I am lucky."
"[Lorelai walks into the room]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory, quick, uh, what are the three major Hindu deities, because I've missed four questions in a row and if I miss another one, I don't think I get dessert."
"RORY: Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu."
"LORELAI: Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu. Hi other daughter."
"CAROL: Hi."
"LORELAI: And I probably shouldn't do a gesundheit joke when I say Vishnu?"
"RORY: Good thinking."
"LORELAI: Okay, thanks, bye. [leaves room]"
"RORY: Wait, I'll go with you. [to Carol] I'm glad to have met you."
"CAROL: Oh, same here. Good luck with Harvard."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Rory walks into the hallway and hugs Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Oh. . . oh. What's that for?"
"RORY: For not putting me on the conveyor belt."
"LORELAI: Yes, that was very big of me."
"RORY: You don't know."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE SPRINGSTEEN RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Darren walk out of the house]"
"RORY: Thank you so much for this, for answering all my dumb questions."
"DARREN: You asked no dumb questions, and I hope my answers sufficed."
"RORY: Definitely. Bye. [walks down the front walkway]"
"DARREN: Au revoir."
"LORELAI: Yeah, thank you so much for everything. I know it did a world of good for her."
"DARREN: She's a very impressive young lady."
"LORELAI: I wholeheartedly concur."
"DARREN: You molded her well."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I didn't mold her. Rory popped out that way."
"DARREN: You're being modest."
"LORELAI: You don't know me, do you?"
"DARREN: So long."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Darren goes back into the house as Lorelai walks over to Rory]"
"RORY: What did he say?"
"LORELAI: That you're Godlike."
"RORY: Is that all?"
"LORELAI: Oh, and that his brother Bruce Springsteen would be happy to come and play at our next party or event."
"RORY: That would be swell of Bruce."
"LORELAI: I figured your graduation party."
"RORY: I'll be very popular."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[That night, people are gathered at Miss Patty's studio for a town meeting]"
"TAYLOR: All in favor, say aye."
"EVERYONE: Aye."
"TAYLOR: All right, let the record show that the funds have been approved to close the town bank account that holds the town funds in order to open a new town funds bank account at a different banking institution."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"TAYLOR: Young ladies, in anticipation of your tardiness, we saved two seats for you right there in the back."
"LORELAI: Thanks for thinking of us, Taylor. [they walk up to sit in the front] Whew! Okay, raise your hand if you bathed in cologne."
"TAYLOR: In the interest of getting home sometime tonight, I'd like to bring up the final point of business, and that is a certain citizen's desire to open an old fashioned soda shop in town."
"LUKE: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa."
"BABETTE: Who's the guy?"
"LUKE: What other putz would wanna open up an old-fashioned soda shop?"
"TAYLOR: Dispense with the Yiddish, young man."
"LUKE: This is not a town matter, Taylor. This is a private matter between you and me which was settled when I said no."
"TAYLOR: This is a town matter because when this town is in need of a particular business to provide necessary services, it's up to the town to band together and lure it."
"LUKE: How does a stupid soda shop count as a necessary business?"
"TAYLOR: Allow me to show you something that will make you wonder how we ever lived without it. Kirk, if you will."
"[Kirk pushes a covered table in front of the podium]"
"TAYLOR: Kirk, I told you to get something decorative to cover it."
"KIRK: Well, my mom wouldn't let me use one of her nice tablecloths so I just grabbed a sheet from my hamper."
"TAYLOR: Take it off."
"[Kirk removes the sheet to reveal a miniature model of the proposed soda shop]"
"LUKE: What's that, a toy?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, it's awfully cute."
"TAYLOR: That is a professionally manufactured diorama of the proposed business."
"RORY: Wow, there's little people and everything."
"SOOKIE: They look so real."
"JACKSON: Hey, it's me holding a tiny zucchini!"
"LORELAI: Look at the horse drawn carriage."
"TAYLOR: My thought was to park it out front with the name of the business painted on the side. It's very eighteen-hundreds."
"BABETTE: The horse is taller than the front door."
"LORELAI: Way taller."
"LUKE: What are you up to, Taylor? Are you breeding giant horses?"
"TAYLOR: It's slightly out of proportion."
"BABETTE: Slightly? That little guy there could walk right under the horse without even ducking."
"TAYLOR: You're missing the big picture here, townsfolk. Now, this wonderful business belongs in Stars Hollow  whether Luke rents the space willingly or not."
"LUKE: How would I not rent it willingly?"
"TAYLOR: I'm talking about eminent domain, my friend. Check the town's bylaws. If a three-fourths majority finds it necessary to use the space for a specific function, the landowner must concede."
"LUKE: That's for taking over houses to turn into hospitals during a national emergency like the Civil w*r. If you wanna turn this place into a Civil w*r hospital, be my guest!"
"TAYLOR: Some would attest that the succor that my soda shop is going to offer is on the same level as the comfort that a hospital could provide."
"LUKE: You're gonna need a hospital, Taylor!"
"LORELAI: Hit him!"
"RORY: Which one?"
"LORELAI: Either one, I'm easy."
"TAYLOR: Come on, Luke. This shop is based on the original soda shop that was in town eighty years ago. Don't you see? You are preventing the town "
"LUKE: From moving backwards. Who here wants to do that?"
"LORELAI: [in high voice] We like ice cream."
"LUKE: Oh, come on."
"RORY: A nice burger from Luke's and an ice cream soda, yum!"
"LUKE: You want that thing?"
"LORELAI: With a cherry."
"LUKE: With the striped awning and the giant horse?"
"[Lorelai and Rory nod]"
"LUKE: [to Taylor] Be ready to pay through the nose."
"TAYLOR: We'll talk terms. We have our soda shop everybody! Meeting dismissed."
"KIRK: Taylor, is it too soon to talk about management opportunities?"
"LORELAI: [to Luke] Hey, you get to be Taylor's landlord, that's kind of cool."
"LUKE: Thanks for your lack of help."
"LORELAI: Grump."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[As people file out of the town meeting, Lane walks up to Lorelai and Rory]"
"LANE: So, how was lunch with Harvard guy?"
"RORY: Great, he answered all my questions."
"LORELAI: He makes a k*ll chicken, he sticks a lemon up its butt."
"LANE: Nice."
"RORY: And he gave me excellent tips on how to write my essay. We're very impressed with him."
"LORELAI: He passes the test."
"[a boy walks up to Lane]"
"DAVE: Excuse me, Lane?"
"LANE: That's me."
"DAVE: Okay, great, I'm Dave Rygalski."
"LANE: Right, hi. You're a guitarist."
"DAVE: Yeah."
"LANE: But how'd you know I was me?"
"DAVE: The Dead Kennedys shirt was a tip off."
"LANE: Good thinking. Hey, uh, isn't it a drag that Jello Biafra isn't singing for them anymore?"
"DAVE: Yeah, now their front-man's that kid from the Courtship of Eddie's Father."
"LANE: Yeah, what's next  Urkel joining the Wu-Tang Clan?"
"DAVE: Or maybe Malcolm in the Middle fronting for the Butthole Surfers."
"LANE: Some things are sacred."
"DAVE: I'm with ya on that."
"LANE: So, um, what's your band like?"
"DAVE: We do a lot of cool covers  uh, the Clash, the Kinks, et cetera. Statistically, it's like thirty-eight of the forty-three bands you listed."
"LANE: Nice percentage."
"DAVE: I can play you a song we demo'd a couple weeks ago using a drum machine."
"LANE: Great. [he takes some audio equipment out of his bag] What's all this?"
"DAVE: Well, this is a headphone amp and it just boosts the volume and makes the clarity off the hook, and then these are Grado 125s, which is just really, k*ll, k*ll portable sound. I'm sort of an audio geek, sorry."
"LANE: No, don't apologize, I love you. . .for that, for being that way. I love it. Um, I'm like that too."
"DAVE: You wanna go over to the bench maybe and have a listen?"
"LANE: Yeah."
"DAVE: Okay."
"[they walk away]"
"RORY: I think a love song's in their future."
"LORELAI: With lots of lyrics about snogging."
"RORY: About what?"
"[Dean walks up behind them]"
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hey. [they kiss] You missed everything."
"LORELAI: That's snogging."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: Bye. [walks away]"
"DEAN: So, any fireworks?"
"RORY: Well, there was a classic Luke/Taylor dispute, but it was resolved and will result in ice cream floats and twenty foot horses."
"DEAN: Good deal. And what about your lunch?"
"RORY: Oh, it was great. I feel so much better about things now. The application's not freaking me out anymore."
"DEAN: You look unfreaked."
"RORY: Well, nothing can stop me now. It's full steam ahead."
"DEAN: That's great. Can I ask you something?"
"RORY: Of course you can."
"DEAN: What happens when you leave?"
"RORY: When I leave when?"
"DEAN: When you leave for Harvard. . .do we break up?"
"RORY: Whoa, that was blunt and out of nowhere."
"DEAN: Well, it seems like we should be blunt right now."
"RORY: No, we don't break up. Do you want that?"
"DEAN: No, but how will we see each other?"
"RORY: Easy, weekends  that's what they were invented for."
"DEAN: So you'll come home, do homework all weekend, then leave."
"RORY: No, I can do my homework during the week or on the train coming home to see you, who I will spend my weekends with not doing homework. Plus, we can talk during the week on the phone constantly. Trust me, it'll feel like I never left."
"DEAN: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Christiane Amanpour spends half of her life standing in foxholes in third world countries, and she has a husband and a kid. And she was on C-SPAN last week getting some award, so if she and her husband can make it work, we can."
"DEAN: So we'll have access to the CNN jet?"
"RORY: No. Or hey, you can go to college in Boston."
"DEAN: I'm going to junior college."
"RORY: Boston has junior colleges."
"DEAN: But not dorm rooms."
"RORY: Well, you can rent an apartment."
"DEAN: With the money I get when I win the lottery? I mean, I think access to the CNN jet is more likely."
"RORY: Why are you being like this? So. . ."
"DEAN: Realistic?"
"RORY: Come on, be serious."
"DEAN: I am. I am."
"RORY: That's too serious."
"DEAN: Yeah, uh, you know, just forget it. Come on, we were gonna go to Luke's, right?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"DEAN: Let's go to Luke's."
"[they walk past Lane and Dave on the bench]"
"LANE: It's great, it really is."
"DAVE: Okay, cool. Well, listen, then I'll talk to the guys, uh, and we'll get together and play next week."
"LANE: Sure. Um, I've gotta get home."
"DAVE: All right. Well, uh, it was good meeting you, Lane."
"LANE: Same here."
"[Lane takes off her Dead Kennedys shirt; underneath is a shirt that says Trust God]"
"DAVE: Trust God  is that a band?"
"LANE: No. My life."
"[pan to Lorelai, Sookie, and Jackson]"
"SOOKIE: Oh, come on, you do not like modern art."
"JACKSON: Oh, then I was mistaken, I guess I don't. I'm a mindless android, I have no opinions."
"SOOKIE: Well, what kind do you like?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, do you like the kind that looks like someone hemorrhaged on a canvas?"
"JACKSON: Yes, I love hemorrhaging."
"SOOKIE: Or the sculpture that looks like it was dropped and then glued back together?"
"JACKSON: Actually, the real love of my life is being mercilessly teased by the two of you for simply stating an opinion."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're sorry."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, we're sorry. Kisses!"
"JACKSON: Oh, in public, no less."
"LORELAI: Hey, where's Rory? We need all the girls a-kissing ya."
"JACKSON: Hey, that reminds me, what are you gonna do with Rory's room?"
"LORELAI: Her room, when?"
"JACKSON: When she's gone. Are you doing anything with it?"
"LORELAI: Well, I haven't thought about it."
"JACKSON: Well, let me know. We can work something out."
"LORELAI: You want her room?"
"SOOKIE: For what, your burgeoning modern art collection?"
"JACKSON: I'm talking about my tools."
"SOOKIE: Oh, your tools, yeah."
"LORELAI: What tools?"
"JACKSON: I have this collection of antique farming tools that my dad passed down to me."
"SOOKIE: Pre-Revolutionary w*r. They're kind of valuable."
"JACKSON: And I've got no place to put them. I've been looking for the right space."
"LORELAI: In Rory's room?"
"SOOKIE: It's perfect!"
"LORELAI: But she's got all her stuff in it."
"JACKSON: Not for long."
"LORELAI: Yeah, right, not for long."
"JACKSON: Just think about it."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I will. I will."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[The phone is ringing]"
"LORELAI: No, no, not another band phone call!"
"RORY: We never gave Lane a cutoff time."
"LORELAI: Let the machine get it. I cannot talk to another seventeen-year-old whose every other word is uh'."
"RORY: Not even a word."
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"[They stand next to the phone and listen to the machine]"
"DARREN: [on answering machine] Hello, Gilmores! This is Darren Springsteen, how are ya? I just wanted to let you know that I just finished going over Rory's records here, and no shock, they're perfect. Rory, you are tailor-made for Harvard. They're lucky to have you. As far as I'm concerned, you should pack your bags. I'm gonna tell all this to the people in admissions and I'll give your headmaster a call as well, so take care and we'll talk again. Bye-bye. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: That's fantastic, honey."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You're in."
"RORY: Well, not officially."
"LORELAI: He said pack your bags."
"RORY: Yeah, cool."
"LORELAI: So what are you up to today? You have, uh, newspaper stuff to do, right?"
"RORY: Yeah, a ton, and you were going to catch up with some stuff at the inn?"
"LORELAI: Payroll. . . a lot of check signing to do."
"RORY: Are people waiting for their checks?"
"LORELAI: Kind of."
"RORY: Right. You know, um, the newspaper stuff can wait til Monday."
"LORELAI: Really? Cause I can sign the checks tomorrow."
"RORY: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"RORY: So what do you wanna do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, what do you wanna do?"
"RORY: I don't know, let's just hang."
"LORELAI: That sounds great."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the sidewalk past Luke's. Luke is arguing with Taylor about a sign he is hanging over the proposed soda shop that says ""Future Home of Taylor's Olde Fashioned Soda Shoppe""]"
"LUKE: You had to have ordered that sign weeks ago! You were that sure that I would cave in?"
"TAYLOR: Well, you did, didn't you? The right's too high."
"LUKE: And when did it become Taylor's? It said Stars Hollow on the stupid model, and I don't like the extra P and E at the end of shop. Get rid of it!"
"TAYLOR: No."
"LUKE: I'm your landlord, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: And as a tenant, I have rights. Talk to my lawyer if you disagree."
"LUKE: And how are you spelling rights, Taylor? With two E's and three S's?"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street toward the gazebo]"

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: So, I think I'm in touch with the other side."
"RORY: The other side of. . ."
"LORELAI: The other side."
"RORY: With republicans?"
"LORELAI: No. Lately I've been having these dark premonitions."
"RORY: Oh, about what?"
"[Luke brings their plates]"
"LUKE: Dead cow, dead cow. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: That's weird."
"RORY: He's always weird."
"LORELAI: No, I mean, my premonitions have been about death, about my death."
"RORY: I don't wanna hear this."
"LORELAI: And the thing is, they're all silly."
"RORY: What do you mean, silly?"
"LORELAI: In one, I slip on a banana peel and fall into a giant vat of whipped cream."
"RORY: Silly and fattening."
"LORELAI: In another, a turtle eats me."
"RORY: A turtle, how?"
"LORELAI: Very slowly. There's lots of chewing."
"RORY: And in your premonition, you didn't run away from what is perhaps the slowest land animal on the earth?"
"LORELAI: His first bite injects me with immobilizing poison."
"RORY: Well, you left that part out."
"LORELAI: Now, this last one's a little more gory. I'm out hunting "
"RORY: A favorite Lorelai Gilmore pastime."
"LORELAI: And my g*n backfires and my whole face spins around a bunch of times and winds up in the back of my head like Daffy Duck."
"RORY: That's the silliest one yet."
"LORELAI: Now, if that's how I go, you gotta promise to move my face back to the front of my head like Daffy did with his beak."
"RORY: I should be writing this down."
"LORELAI: You can remember to move my face to the front of my head."
"RORY: It depends on what I have going on that week."
"[Lane walks into the diner]"
"LANE: Hello Stars Hollow, are you ready to rock?"
"LORELAI: Let me guess, band practice tonight?"
"LANE: Yes, we're going to learn our fourth song. That's practically a set."
"[Lane sits down with them and takes a bite of Rory's burger]"
"LORELAI: Hm, I'm impressed."
"LANE: And then once we have a set, we'll get a gig, and then once we get a gig, we'll get a record deal."
"LORELAI: Swallow."
"LANE: And then after we get a record deal, we'll get really famous and then we'll have to give all of these interviews about how horrible it is to be really famous and how we never wanted this in the first place, all we care about is the music, and fame is gonna tear us apart. It's gonna be great!"
"LORELAI: And rehearsing in the music shop's been working out?"
"LANE: Perfectly  it's totally time efficient, being a thirty-second commute from my house. We practice for two hours, I'm home in time to watch reruns of Johnny Yune's talk show on Korean television with my mom, who thinks I hooked up with you guys  which I did, so I'm not even lying."
"LORELAI: Well, you're kinda lying."
"LANE: I'm fibbing, but a fib is not a lie."
"LORELAI: Hm, I'd say it's a fib-slash-lie."
"LANE: No, no, it's not a lie, and I can always tell cause of the few times that I've out and out lied to my mother, I'd get this feeling in my gut like a wild animal was burrowing into it, and I'm not getting that."
"LORELAI: Wild animals burrowing into my stomach  another one of my premonitions."
"RORY: Pretty spooky."
"LANE: I've gotta go. I'm single-handedly improving the reputation of drummers everywhere by being on time for every rehearsal. [takes Rory's burger] Thanks for the food. [leaves]"
"[Rory takes Lorelai's burger]"
"LORELAI: Uh, excuse me."
"RORY: Lane took mine."
"LORELAI: Okay, this band thing is really not working out for me. Let's go. See ya, Luke."
"LUKE: See ya."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk to the door as Shane walks in]"
"LORELAI: Turn sideways!"
"[Shane rushes past them over to Jess at the counter]"
"LORELAI: That girl's a freak."
"[Jess and Shane start kissing]"
"LUKE: Make a hole."
"[Jess and Shane stop kissing long enough for Luke to walk past them]"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO THE MUSIC SHOP"
"[Lane and her band are practicing]"
"ZACH: [sings] London calling to the faraway towns, now that the w*r's declared and battle come down. London calling to the underworld, come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls. . ."
"DAVE: Whoa whoa whoa, can you guys hold it? It doesn't sound right."
"LANE: It sounded good to me."
"DAVE: No, it's wrong. Something's missing."
"ZACH: Yeah, volume."
"LANE: We can't play any louder, guys."
"ZACH: We've got to."
"LANE: But that's the agreement  free practice space, but we have to play quietly."
"DAVE: Just try and live with it, Zach."
"ZACH: Dude, Brian's breathing is louder than the song."
"BRIAN: I've got a deviated septum. All the women in my family and me have it."
"ZACH: Well, it's throwing me off."
"LANE: Hold your breath when we're playing, Brian. There, problem solved. Okay, come on, now, let's rock. One, two, three "
"ZACH: Wait. The bottom line here is that breathing should not be louder than a rock band. Am I right or am I right?"
"BRIAN: You're right."
"ZACH: Rygalski?"
"DAVE: Well, it "
"ZACH: We need to crank it up."
"LANE: Just listen harder, that'll make it sound louder."
"DAVE: Can't we turn it up at all?"
"LANE: Well, maybe we could possibly turn the amps up from three to, say, three and a half, but that's it."
"ZACH: Forget it."
"DAVE: Zach, come on, we just got started."
"ZACH: Dude, Lawrence Welk cranked louder than this. It's a waste of time."
"LANE: Wait, Zach, no, you don't understand. We can't play louder. See, my mom has this special antenna that can pick up non-Christian music being played within a football field's distance of our house, and she'd immediately come looking for me in order to shield me from the perversion."
"BRIAN: If Zach's going, I'm going."
"LANE: Wait, no, Brian, I'm not exaggerating. Once, a guy in our town named Kirk was practicing Bohemian Rhapsody with his band, the Kirk Gleason Five, and my mom shut them down so fast that the band fled without their instruments and never came back for them. To this day, Kirk can't listen to Queen without tearing up."
"BRIAN: Sorry."
"ZACH: Having a free practice space was cool and all, but not like this."
"BRIAN: We should just rent a space in Hartford."
"LANE: Hartford, Connecticut?"
"ZACH: It's not that far."
"LANE: Yeah, or maybe, how bout France? We could practice in France, too, or Iceland!"
"DAVE: Lane."
"LANE: The moon's probably available, we could crank it way up on the moon!"
"DAVE: A word, please."
"[Dave leads Lane outside onto the sidewalk]"
"LANE: Dave, talk to them. You're the leader, that's flat out insubordination going on in there! They show be flogged, heel-hogged, strung up from the highest yardarm!"
"DAVE: No, I can't."
"LANE: Why?"
"DAVE: Because we're supposed to be a one-for-all band like the Clash or U2  it's a democracy."
"LANE: Democracies are overrated. Now get in there and kick some butt."
"DAVE: It's not how it works."
"LANE: I'll fix Brian's deviated septum  I'll ram one of my sticks up his nose!"
"DAVE: Lane, think about this, do you really believe this is working?"
"LANE: No, it's not working. We sound like a bunch of w*nk*r."
"DAVE: We need a real practice space. We need to be able to really play. Wouldn't you like to actually be able to hit both the cymbals?"
"LANE: Yeah."
"DAVE: Okay, then, we need to do this."
"LANE: I know, I just don't wanna leave the band."
"DAVE: What? You can't leave the band. That's not what anybody wants, especially me. Lane, listen to me, okay  you're perfect for us, it's working."
"LANE: So I have to figure out a way to rehearse in Hartford two or three nights a week."
"DAVE: Yeah, that's not so tough."
"LANE: No, it's not so tough. And maybe at the same time I'll attempt to master quantum physics, and throw Sanskrit in there, too."
"DAVE: Do your best. Not with the Sanskrit thing, that's pretty worthless  but with the band."
"LANE: I'll try."
"DAVE: There's no way you're gonna become our Pete Best. There's no way."
"LANE: You're sweet."
"DAVE: We should get back in there."
"LANE: Okay, um, I'll be in in a minute."
"CUT TO LANE'S BEDROOM"
"[Lane is in her closet talking on the phone]"
"LANE: Wrack your brain. I mean, we've really gotta think here."
"RORY: It's quite a pickle."
"LANE: No, Rory, pickles are smaller. This is much bigger than a pickle."
"[At Lorelai's house, Rory is in her bedroom on the phone]"
"RORY: Okay, let's stop saying the word pickle."
"LANE: Fine."
"RORY: Now, how many nights a week would you have to go to Hartford to practice?"
"LANE: Two, plus a weekend afternoon."
"RORY: Okay, so that's three big blocks of time that you'd have to account for."
"LANE: Very big blocks of time."
"RORY: Plus, you have no car to transport your drums anywhere as of yet."
"LANE: Or a driver's license."
"RORY: Or any drums because you're borrowing them from the shop."
"LANE: Temporarily until I can buy my own set  with money that I don't know where I'm gonna get."
"RORY: Yup, you're right  that's more than a pickle."
"LANE: You're making light  now stop and focus. And turn down the Cornershop, it's distracting."
"RORY: No, your Coltrane is distracting, turn that down."
"LANE: Hey, I'm in angst here and Coltrane speaks to my soul. I can't turn it down."
"RORY: Fine, in deference to your soul, I'll turn mine down. Hey, here's a crazy thought. How about you tell your mom the truth and insist that she lets you play with the band and rehearse in Stars Hollow loudly as long as your schoolwork doesn't suffer?"
"LANE: Oh, I'm sorry, was that a serious suggestion?"
"RORY: Hey, it's worth a sh*t."
"LANE: No, you're thinking your mom, here, Rory. If I said that to mine, she'd start waving a crucifix at me."
"RORY: If she says no, she says no, but right now you're out of options. We have another call, just think about it?"
"LANE: Okay, I will. And hey, you know I like Cornershop."
"RORY: I know. Bye."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Rory answers the call waiting]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"DEBBIE: Hi, Rory?"
"RORY: Yes."
"DEBBIE: This is Debbie Fincher  Kathy's mom from Stars Hollow High."
"RORY: Oh, hi Mrs. Fincher."
"DEBBIE: Well, hi right back to you. You know, we miss you since you started that fancy school of yours. Is it fun?"
"RORY: It's hard but I like it."
"DEBBIE: Oh well, super. Uh, listen, is your mom home?"
"RORY: Oh, sure, just a second. Say hi to Kathy for me."
"DEBBIE: I will."
"RORY: Hold on."
"[Rory walks into the kitchen; Lorelai is sitting at the table]"
"RORY: Phone. It's Debbie Fincher."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: From Stars Hollow High. Kathy Fincher's mom."
"LORELAI: Oh, I remember Kathy."
"RORY: You met Debbie many times, had many conversations with her at bake sales, school plays, the PTA."
"LORELAI: Not ringing a bell."
"RORY: I used to go swimming at her house all the time. You and Debbie had long chats when you dropped me off."
"LORELAI: No. . .no."
"RORY: Blonde hair, medium height, drove a Range Rover."
"LORELAI: Does she also breathe and have toes?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, narrow it down to less than eight thousand possibilities."
"RORY: I did with the swimming."
"LORELAI: I remember the water."
"RORY: Come on, blonde hair, medium height."
"LORELAI: See, even you can't think of another way to describe her."
"RORY: You have no memory of this woman?"
"LORELAI: All those Stars Hollow moms looked alike, except for Lane's mom and that one mom with the freaky glass eye that never moved."
"RORY: Take the phone."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hi Debbie, how are you?"
"DEBBIE: Great, Lorelai, and yourself?"
"LORELAI: Just fine, thanks."
"DEBBIE: The gang and I have missed you so much at school events. You were always such a kick."
"LORELAI: Aw, well, I really miss you and the gang."
"DEBBIE: Hey, listen, I have a proposition for you. The PTA likes to ask prominent locals in business if they could talk to the students about how they got to where they are  you know, all the hard work it takes, success stories, you know. And we thought about you."
"LORELAI: To suggest people I know who have success stories, or. . ."
"DEBBIE: No, silly, we'd like for you to address the class."
"LORELAI: Me, really?"
"DEBBIE: Well, yes. You're a young woman and you run that beautiful inn, it's a huge responsibility, and you do it with such style."
"LORELAI: Wow, well, that's really sweet. It's always nice to be well thought of."
"Oh, Debbie, before we go any further, I'm dying to know  how's Kathy? What's she up to?"
"DEBBIE: She is just terrific. She's applied to a couple schools in California, so she's really excited, although. . ."
"[Lorelai covers the mouthpiece of the phone and talks to Rory]"
"LORELAI: So she wants me to speak to some kids about my business success."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: That's great. What are you doing with the phone?"
"LORELAI: Oh, she's blabbing about her kid. We probably got another thirty seconds or so."
"RORY: You're awful."
"LORELAI: No, I'm a kick. Should I do it?"
"RORY: Yeah, toot your own horn, you little missy."
"LORELAI: I'm a success, who'd have thought?"
"RORY: I suspected you had it in you."
"LORELAI: From rags to riches. . .I wonder why Larry King hasn't called."
"RORY: Mom, Debbie, please."
"[Lorelai brings the phone back up to her ear]"
"DEBBIE: . . .so the internship will keep her local, which is a nice bonus for Bill and me, you know?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure, yeah. Well, be sure to say hi to her and to Bill, and by the way, yes, I'd be happy to talk to the class."
"DEBBIE: Terrific! Oh, the gang will be so thrilled. Now, there'll probably be a second speaker with you, do you mind?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's fine, who's it gonna be?"
"DEBBIE: Uh, well, we've had some suggestions, but do you know anyone?"
"LORELAI: Well, you know, my friend the Sultan of Brunei is so hard to pin down."
"DEBBIE: Ha-ha, there's that sense of humor. Well, we were considering Luke Danes, but he usually turns these things down."
"LORELAI: I could talk to him if you'd like."
"DEBBIE: That would be just terrific. The two of you together would be a kick."
"LORELAI: Well, then, I'll just kick him til he agrees to do it, how does that sound?"
"DEBBIE: Okay, Thursday at four p.m., is that okay?"
"LORELAI: I'll be there, Deb."
"DEBBIE: Oh, you rat! You rat!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"DEBBIE: You remembered how much I hate being called Deb."
"LORELAI: I'm wicked."
"DEBBIE: Well, thank you Lorelai, and I'll talk to you soon."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye. [hangs up] Huh. She hates being called Deb."
"RORY: I'll make a mental note. [pinches Lorelai's cheeks]"
"LORELAI: Ow, ow, ow!"
"RORY: I'm so proud of my little success!"
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lane walks down the steps. She starts to walk toward her mother in the kitchen, then walks back to the steps and starts talking to herself]"
"LANE: Stop it, don't run, just walk in there and tell her what you want. After all, she's your mother and she wants you to be happy . . .on some level, I think. Maybe not. What are you doing? Do not back off. Just move. Come on, move. Move your foot, move your foot, one foot. Lane, move your foot, right."
"[her mother comes up behind her]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: Yeah?"
"MRS. KIM: Come with me."
"LANE: Okay."
"[They walk to the kitchen.]"
"MRS. KIM: Sit, sit. You want tea?"
"LANE: Mama, I wanna "
"MRS. KIM: Sit."
"LANE: Sorry. I wanted to talk to you about something, um, an idea I had. . have, for me to do something that would be very beneficial to me, and you by extension because well, if one person is happy, then the other person is happy, and so I had an idea that, of how I could be and then you could be and then we would be and. . .tea would be good."
"MRS. KIM: Here, I want you to fill these out. [hands her a stack of papers]"
"LANE: What are these?"
"MRS. KIM: College applications."
"LANE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: Don't worry. Every one in this pile approved by me and Reverend Melmin."
"LANE: I haven't heard of one of these schools."
"MRS. KIM: They're all good religious programs, and I've already thrown out the ones that let boys and girls sit in the cafeteria together, the party schools."
"LANE: Oh, great."
"MRS. KIM: I will help you fill them out and we'll mail them on the way to choir practice, okay?"
"LANE: Yes, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: Good. Now, if you meet Jesus walking on the street, what are the three questions you would like to ask? Ah."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is at the front desk organizing some index cards]"
"MICHEL: Hm, your speech for that class?"
"LORELAI: Just some talking points."
"MICHEL: And this speech is about your success in business, yes?"
"LORELAI: Pretty much."
"MICHEL: You must be very fortunate to live in this tiny town where people make very little money. It elevates you by comparison."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"MICHEL: I wonder who their last speaker was -- the fellow in short pants that walks up and down the square with a metal detector?"
"LORELAI: Hm, I wouldn't know."
"MICHEL: And if they find someone who drives a car that is less than eight years old, what will they do  crown him king of successful people?"
"LORELAI: Unless it's a woman, and then they'll crown her queen."
"MICHEL: Mm, and if they are "
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Go away. [answers phone] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"LUKE: I'm backing out."
"LORELAI: Too late, sorry."
"LUKE: I'm not speaking to that stupid class."
"LORELAI: But you agreed."
"LUKE: I'm out, case closed, no debating."
"LORELAI: Great, fine, do what you want. I guess I'm just out the thousand-dollar deposit."
"LUKE: What deposit?"
"LORELAI: For the room."
"LUKE: What room?"
"LORELAI: For the thing, for the afterwards thing. . ."
"LUKE: Oh, wait, now, you're talking crazy talk trying to confuse me, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: Aren't you?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Who?"
"LUKE: Stop."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"LUKE: Uh, hold on a sec! I agreed to this under coercion."
"LORELAI: You said yes on your own."
"LUKE: I said yes because when I said no you talked baby talk loudly in front of all my customers until I got so sick of it I just agreed to do it to shut you up."
"LORELAI: I'm incorrigible!"
"LUKE: It's not a binding agreement, it's coercion."
"LORELAI: Well, you gave in just in time because, uh, I was about to transition out of baby talk and into my Louis Armstrong voice, and that, my friend, is a whole lot worse than baby talk."
"LUKE: I hate that building."
"LORELAI: What, the school?"
"LUKE: Three years of going there, I have no good memories."
"LORELAI: You must have some."
"LUKE: None. Kids were as dumb then as they are now."
"LORELAI: I think you'll enjoy this."
"LUKE: Think about going back to your high school to give a talk. How would that feel?"
"LORELAI: Okay, not all your points are bad, but it's not my school, it's your school, and if you cancel, this whole town will know and when you walk down the street people will point and whisper, There goes that Luke, he's a real talk-canceler guy.'"
"LUKE: Ouch."
"LORELAI: Plus, I promised the PTA, so my fragile reputation is on the line."
"LUKE: I think you'll live."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: No!"
"LORELAI: [in Louis Armstrong voice] Hello, Dolly!"
"LUKE: Stop that."
"LORELAI: [in Louis Armstrong voice] This is Louis, Dolly!"
"LUKE: I'll just hang up."
"LORELAI: [in Louis Armstrong voice] I'll be coming round the diner singing soooooooongs."
"LUKE: Have you been diagnosed?"
"LORELAI: See you tomorrow at four."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"LANE: Oh, it was a fine collection, believe me."
"RORY: She made you apply to every one?"
"LANE: And measured my head for a wimple."
"RORY: Out of twenty-three schools, there wasn't one that you might want to go to?"
"LANE: It depends on what I'm looking for. Of course, all the great Seventh Day Adventist schools were represented, with their ban on dancing, gum chewing and bowling. Quaker College was a delightful surprise, with its special appeal to Richard Nixon, who's dead but still deeply involved in campus recruiting. Oh, and the piece de resistance! She found an Amish school in Nicaragua. Nicaragua! A big shout out to Mama Kim on that one!"
"RORY: Look, Mama Kim always starts out super serious on everything but then lightens with time."
"LANE: But I don't have time. Schools that I like will fill up and my band, my beloved band, will find another drummer, and if it's a girl I'm gonna be twice as mad."
"RORY: Look, Lane, just try to calm down."
"LANE: No, calm is for losers. I've spent my whole life compromising and being the good little girl and not doing what I want. Or doing what I want and hiding it and feeling guilty for doing it, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. I mean, I even lost my first boyfriend because of all this."
"RORY: What boyfriend?"
"LANE: Henry."
"RORY: Oh, right, Henry."
"LANE: See, that's how pathetic my life is. I'm calling a boyfriend a guy that I never even went out on a date with, and that my own best friend doesn't even remember, which is not your fault because there's nothing to remember."
"RORY: Okay, so besides power walking, what are you gonna do about it?"
"LANE: Take a stand!"
"RORY: What kind of stand? [Lane walks into the beauty supply store] Lane!"
"[Rory follows her inside]"
"CUT TO INSIDE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE"
"RORY: Lane."
"LANE: Follow my anger."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LANE: Choosing a color."
"RORY: You're gonna dye your hair?"
"LANE: Yes, I am. Lots of choices here. Help me narrow it down."
"RORY: You can't do this."
"LANE: Of course I can."
"RORY: And what, walk around in a hood all the time? How are you gonna hide this from your mom?"
"LANE: I'm not gonna hide it, that's the point."
"RORY: Lane, think about this for a second, at least."
"LANE: Rory, I've been thinking about this my whole life. Nothing's gonna change unless I change it, and now's the time. I need to make a clear statement, one I can't go back on or chicken out on, one that everyone can see. And this is my instrument, it says This is me, this is Lane Kim.' [holds up a container of dye]"
"RORY: That is you, it's black hair dye."
"LANE: This is merely a prop until we find my true color. Now, what do you think? Pink? Or is that too Pink the singer and Kelly Osbourne and Gwen Stefani. . .man, there's a lot of cheese associated with the color pink. Okay, pink's out. There. . .there's blue  what about blue?"
"RORY: Blue's probably not right for your skin tone, and I agree with you about pink. What about purple?"
"LANE: Yes, purple, you're brilliant."
"RORY: And bleach, don't forget the bleach."
"LANE: Bleach, right, okay, I'll get the bleach. Thank you."
"[Rory walks to the checkout counter]"
"RORY: And make sure that you get some. . . gloves."
"[Rory is surprised when she sees that Shane is the cashier. Lane walks to the counter with a pile of supplies]"
"LANE: Got them."
"RORY: Good, good."
"LANE: You all right?"
"RORY: Yeah, fine, let's go."
"LANE: It's a good day today, isn't it?"
"SHANE: Mmhmm. Twelve fifty-two."
"LANE: And I've got exact change for you."
"SHANE: Super. [sees Rory staring at her] You need something?"
"RORY: No. No, I just, um. . . I was wondering if there's a money-back guarantee. You know, in case her hair falls out or something."
"SHANE: Um, sure. If your hair falls out, we'll give you your money back."
"RORY: Good. You heard that. The second you go bald, you can come get your money back."
"LANE: Rory, you're putting a damper on my Independence Day."
"RORY: Sorry, let's go."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[The next day, Lorelai walks into Luke's]"
"LORELAI: Lucas, la escuela!"
"LUKE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey. Did you lose track of time?"
"LUKE: What? Why?"
"LORELAI: It's four o'clock."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: We were supposed to be at the school, like, now."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: But you're not ready."
"LUKE: What? Oh, right, right, sorry. [removes apron] Okay, I'm ready."
"LORELAI: Au contraire."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: You are so not ready."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: The grunge look is out."
"LUKE: Hey, I'm not dressing up for this."
"LORELAI: Well, you need something better than that."
"LUKE: The whole point of this stupid class talk was for us to talk about our work and our success. This flannel shirt is my most successful outfit. I've closed many a deal in this outfit. It's my power outfit."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"[Lorelai grabs his shirt collar and pulls him upstairs]"
"LUKE: Hey, hey, hey, hey, let go, let go, hey, you're pinching me!"
"LORELAI: Go!"
"[cut to upstairs hallway]"
"LUKE: I don't wanna change."
"LORELAI: Be a good boy and I'll buy you a toy afterward. You wanna toy?"
"[cut to inside Luke's apartment; Lorelai and Luke walk in, Jess is inside]"
"LORELAI: Sorry to barge in."
"JESS: No problem. What was that about a toy?"
"LORELAI: Your Uncle Luke is getting one if he's a good boy."
"LUKE: Can we make this more demeaning? Hey, why don't you go downstairs and help out Caesar?"
"JESS: I think my education comes first, don't you?"
"[Lorelai pulls a shirt out of Luke's closet]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Jimmy Buffett?"
"LUKE: Put that back."
"LORELAI: You like Jimmy Buffett? He's so mellow."
"LUKE: I've just been to a few shows, that's all."
"LORELAI: A few shows? Oh my God, you're a Buffetthead."
"LUKE: Is that the one you want me to wear or not?"
"LORELAI: Sing Margaritaville."
"LUKE: No."
"JESS: That attitude's gonna lose you that toy."
"LUKE: Stay outta this!"
"[Lorelai pulls another shirt from the closet]"
"LORELAI: We've got ourselves a winner."
"LUKE: Fine, fine, come on. [takes the shirt and walks toward the bathroom]"
"LORELAI: Just change in here."
"LUKE: I'll be more comfortable in here. [goes into bathroom]"
"LORELAI: I've seen you swimming at the lake so I've seen you with your shirt off."
"JESS: Lately? Cause he's really let himself go."
"LUKE: [from bathroom] I'll be one second."
"LORELAI: Lose the baseball cap, too."
"JESS: You run the risk of his head falling off without it."
"LORELAI: I think he'll be okay."
"[Lorelai looks at Jess' closet curiously]"
"JESS: Something wrong?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no. . .no, I just. . .no."
"[Luke walks out of the bathroom]"
"LUKE: Happy?"
"LORELAI: Thrilled. Now a tie with that would be just great."
"LUKE: We're leaving. And it's gotta be something I don't have to put together."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: My toy."
"LORELAI: Got it."
"JESS: Talk good."
"[Luke and Lorelai walk out of the apartment]"
"[cut to hallway]"
"LORELAI: Wow, we're late. Oh, by the way, Jess had a girl in the closet."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Come on, pip pip!"
"LUKE: Who? What was that? Lorelai? What about the closet?CUT TO LANE'S HOUSE"
"[Lane and Rory are in the bathroom preparing to bleach Lane's hair]"
"LANE: Okay, combs, rags, instructions, timer, towels, tunes."
"RORY: All systems a go."
"LANE: So far, so good."
"RORY: Now, are you sure about this?"
"LANE: Will you stop?"
"RORY: I'm just making sure."
"LANE: I'll sign a waiver if you want. Hit play please."
"RORY: We should open a window, shouldn't we?"
"LANE: It's freezing outside."
"RORY: Yeah, but the bleach is gonna stink up the whole house."
"LANE: Let it. Let it be the first clue that something's happened for when my mom gets home. Let the thick smell of bleach meet her at the doorway like a force that'll usher her into the next chapter of Lane Kim's life. The smell of bleach is the smell of freedom!"
"RORY: You're very dramatic today."
"LANE: To hell with the floor! Oh, that felt good to say."
"RORY: You done?"
"LANE: I'm done."
"RORY: Take your seat, please. [Lane sits] And here we go. [Rory starts applying the bleach] How you doing?"
"LANE: Fine."
"RORY: Feeling good?"
"LANE: Feeling great. This is such a catharsis. I have never felt so naturally high in my life. Stings a little, though."
"RORY: Yeah, that happens."
"LANE: But just a little, no biggie. More than a little actually, it's kind of a big little."
"RORY: Just keep me posted."
"LANE: In that case, it's kind of a lot. Yup, yup, a lot of sting happening here."
"RORY: Try thinking about something else. God, this smells awful."
"LANE: Okay, thinking about something else, something else. Thinking about puppy dogs. Thinking about getting things in the mail. I love getting things in the mail, letters and packages."
"RORY: Got a package."
"LANE: What's that?"
"RORY: Oh, Jim Carrey says that in Ace Ventura."
"LANE: Good distraction. Still thinking. . .thinking about world events, lots going on there. Thinking about the last movie I saw. Vin Diesel was in it. Thinking about Vin Diesel now. Thinking about where Vin Diesel got the name Vin Diesel. Thinking about Vin Diesel's mysterious ethnicity. Thinking about how surprising it is to have so much to think about with Vin Diesel. Who knew, who knew? Okay, now I'm just thinking about the pain, we're into pain here."
"RORY: Back to Vin Diesel."
"LANE: I've exhausted Vin Diesel, but the pain  that's not exhausted!"
"RORY: What kind of pain is it?"
"LANE: Ever light your head on fire? I haven't, but I don't have to now cause I know how it feels."
"RORY: I'll rinse it out."
"LANE: No, we'd have to start all over again and now that I know how much pain there is, I'll chicken out for sure!"
"RORY: I'm getting dizzy from the smell."
"LANE: Let's focus on my pain. Now read the bottle, tell me what to do in case of pain."
"RORY: Um, blah blah blah, do not apply to a broken scalp  is your scalp broken?"
"LANE: I don't know, maybe. I don't know my scalp that well."
"RORY: There's nothing else about pain. Oh, a girl told me once that if your scalp is hurting from bleach, drink a 7UP. It's something to do with the bubbles."
"LANE: The Kim household does not have soft drinks."
"RORY: Well, what do you got?"
"LANE: Something called Salad Water imported from Korea. Believe me, it's nothing like 7UP."
"RORY: Oh my God, we have to open this window."
"LANE: Okay, I have got to do something!"
"RORY: Run around the block!"
"LANE: Why?"
"RORY: I don't know!"
"LANE: Good enough for me!"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Lorelai, Luke, and Debbie are walking down the hallway]"
"DEBBIE: It's so good of you both to do this, really."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're happy to be here, right?"
"LUKE: Yup, zippity doo dah."
"DEBBIE: Oh, Luke, it must be fun to be back at your old alma mater, huh?"
"LUKE: Oh yeah, I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy here."
"LORELAI: Don't let him fool you. He told me he was so excited about today, he couldn't sleep last night."
"DEBBIE: Oh, we're all excited, too. It's been so long since we saw you, Lorelai. We had some laughs with this one, let me tell you."
"LUKE: Oh yeah, she's a funny one."
"DEBBIE: The book fair of 97. . .what you said to that one rude customer  uh! Priceless how you put him in his place."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I put that man in his place, all right, zing!"
"DEBBIE: Oh oh oh, what you said to him! How could anyone forget?"
"LORELAI: Huh, yeah."
"DEBBIE: Hey, Old Man. . ."
"LORELAI: . . .old man. . ."
"DEBBIE: Stick a crowbar -"
"LORELAI: . . .crowbar. . ."
"DEBBIE: - in your wallet -"
"LORELAI: . . . in his wallet. . ."
"DEBBIE: - and cough up some dough -"
"LORELAI: . . .dough. . ."
"DEBBIE: - cause this is for our kids!"
"LORELAI: . . .our kids! Ha ha!"
"DEBBIE: You do remember!"
"LORELAI: What, it's emblazoned up here Debbie, all those good times."
"DEBBIE: Definitely. Now everyone's gathered. The vice-principal will finish up in a second and then we'll call you in. Lorelai, you wanna go first?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, sure. Is that okay?"
"LUKE: It's okay by me."
"DEBBIE: Great. See you in a minute. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: I couldn't pick that woman out of a lineup if my life depended on it."
"[While Luke walks over to a chair and sits down, Lorelai looks out the door of the school and sees Lane running through the street with bleach on her head. Lorelai walks over to Luke.]"
"LORELAI: Will you lighten up?"
"LUKE: No, I won't lighten up."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"LUKE: I hate this place. Still smells the same  old, repressive."
"[Lorelai sits down next to him and pulls her notecards out of her pocket]"
"LORELAI: Being back here doesn't make you nostalgic at all?"
"LUKE: I liked the final bell, that's about it. What are those?"
"LORELAI: They're, uh, my notes for the talk."
"LUKE: You put thought into this?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, don't you have notes?"
"LUKE: I run a diner, what are my notes? I open the door, people come in, they order food, I cook the food, I serve the food, they eat the food. Then there's a terrific action sequence where I refill coffee and water. And oh, my big finale is a description of the whole end of the evening mopping up ceremony."
"LORELAI: Hey, you're sure you don't mind me going first?"
"LUKE: Are you kidding? There's a good chance you'll yack so much they won't even get to me."
"[Lorelai looks inside a display case]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing, nothing at all, Butch."
"[Luke walks over to her. His high school picture is hanging in the display case with the caption ""State High Hurdles Champion  1985 - Butch Danes""]"
"LUKE: For the love of. . .what's that doing there?"
"LORELAI: What's it doing? It's yelling, Mock me, mock me!'"
"LUKE: It shouldn't be there."
"LORELAI: Oh no, you're right. It should have its own special display at the diner with a big old spotlight on it."
"LUKE: Don't they need my permission for this? This should be illegal."
"LORELAI: No, those shorts with that t*nk top should be illegal."
"LUKE: Okay, stop now."
"LORELAI: What was your girlfriend's name, Sissy?"
"LUKE: As a matter of fact, no."
"LORELAI: Oh, the girls just swooned when Butch Danes took the field."
"LUKE: I knew there was another good reason not to do this."
"LORELAI: Oh no, don't walk away, Butch. Well, if I thought you didn't care, I'd die, oh, I'd just die."
"CUT TO LANE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory and Lane are in the bathroom. Lane's hair is blond.]"
"LANE: It's weird."
"RORY: Like straw."
"LANE: I feel like I should be singing If I Only Had a Brain.'"
"RORY: Now, you feel better? Burning's completely gone?"
"LANE: Completely. I even think the Salad Water's helping."
"RORY: Okay, here goes nothing. [starts applying the purple dye] So have you mentioned dyeing your hair to the band yet?"
"LANE: No, but they'll be cool with it. They've all got tattoos. Dave and Zach have musical themes and Brian's got Snoopy."
"RORY: Poor guy."
"LANE: Yeah, but he's a slamming bass player."
"RORY: So you haven't even mentioned it to Dave?"
"LANE: I just said I didn't tell the band."
"RORY: Not even Dave?"
"LANE: No, not even to Dave. And what's with all the pressing?"
"RORY: I don't know, Dave's just different from the other two."
"LANE: Of course, he's the defacto leader."
"RORY: I know, but it also seemed like from the day you guys met there was a little something happening there."
"LANE: I don't know what you're talking about."
"RORY: You're always talking about him. You always seem to be thinking about him. And now with this hair emancipation of yours, you're going to unheard of lengths to make a statement to your mother about who you are so you can have a sh*t at staying in the band  all roads lead to Dave."
"LANE: Rory, Dave and I are professionals."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: Plus, the rock and roll highway is littered with casualties of band members who have dated and broken the band apart."
"RORY: That's a sensible attitude."
"LANE: Very sensible, very sensible. Dave and I are very sensible people. I'm in love with him."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: Is it that obvious?"
"RORY: Only to a guy with sunglasses and a dog selling pencils."
"LANE: He's so cute."
"RORY: Definitely cute."
"LANE: And smart  you know, that's such a rare package. It's usually one or the other."
"RORY: It's wrong, but that's the way it usually is."
"LANE: It just increases the amount of competition for the Daves of the world."
"RORY: You're rare, too, don't forget."
"LANE: I've never really felt this way before. I mean, Henry  yes, but we never spent any real time together. It's not just puppy love, you know, it's different. I mean, I get butterflies in my stomach when I think about him, and when I call him to work out times for band practice, the ring of his telephone gets me really excited. And last week, someone said Dave at school  it wasn't even about my Dave, and I almost lost it, I got so shaky."
"RORY: My Dave  that's so cute."
"LANE: Stop it."
"RORY: This sounds like love to me."
"LANE: It does, doesn't it? My first love, wow."
"RORY: Yeah, wow."
"LANE: I finally have a first love, like what you and Dean have."
"RORY: Right. . . exactly."
"LANE: Of course, I don't exactly have what you and Dean have because you love Dean and Dean loves you back. In my situation, I love Dave and Dave thinks that I have a decent sense of rhythm."
"RORY: Don't move, you'll drip."
"LANE: God, you're so lucky  to love a guy who actually knows you love him and who loves you back. That's gotta be the best feeling ever."
"RORY: I think this purple's gonna look good."
"LANE: I want that. I want that really bad."
"RORY: You'll have that. You will have your perfect first love and second love and any other love you want because you're great and purple heads will not be denied."
"LANE: Now that should've been put on the box."
"RORY: Okay, now, head down please."

"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Lorelai and Luke are waiting in the hallway. Debbie comes out of the classroom]"
"DEBBIE: Okay, we're all ready for you guys."
"LORELAI: Great, excellent."
"[they walk into the classroom]"
"DEBBIE: Okay, uh, Luke, you can have a seat here while Lorelai's talking, okay?"
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: [points to desk] Hey, what's that? Luke plus Sissy."
"LUKE: Start your speech."
"DEBBIE: Okay, everyone, we're ready to begin. We have two local luminaries here to talk to us today. You probably all recognize Luke Danes from his fabulous diner, but we're really excited to begin with a former Stars Hollow High mom, Lorelai Gilmore."
"[applause]"
"LORELAI: No, no, save it for when I wow you with my brilliance. I'm really happy to be here with you all today. I recognize a lot of you from over the years and you're all getting taller and older  stop it. Anyhow, as some of you know, I run the Independence Inn. Sounds simple, running an inn. Well, the sentence is simple, the job is not. Like most jobs, mine involves many other people, people it is my job to hire, to train, and to inspire because when you have good employees it makes you look good. Oh, questions already  are questions okay?"
"DEBBIE: They're encouraged."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"GIRL 1: You're Rory Gilmore's mom, aren't you?"
"LORELAI: Yes I am, and proud of it."
"GIRL 1: Oh."
"LORELAI: Oh, is that it? Well, I hope all your questions are that easy. Okay, now, why is it necessary to inspire employees? Why can't you just train them and let them do their jobs? Well. . .yes?"
"GIRL 2: Didn't you get pregnant when you were sixteen?"
"LORELAI: Um, sixteen. . .it was around that age. Sixteen, that sounds right. Okay. Different people working for you will have different needs. . .yeah?"
"BOY: Well, what about school?"
"LORELAI: School? I'm sorry."
"BOY: Did you drop out when you got pregnant with Rory?"
"LORELAI: No, technically, I didn't drop out. I, uh, I kept going as long as I could while I got pregnant, which I would recommend to any girl. Not the getting pregnant part, obviously. Um, although, uh, if that happens, um, you know. . . it shouldn't. I mean, it could but you should try to avoid it. . . um, anyway, uh, I got my GED, yeah."
"DEBBIE: Lorelai, why don't we move this along?"
"LORELAI: Yes, oh, moving it along, moving it along. Okay, okay, okay. Boy, I should've been more organized here."
"GIRL 1: Well, are you sorry you got pregnant?"
"LORELAI: No, it brought me Rory, but timing is everything. I mean, I could've. . .sixteen, you guys are sixteen, right . . .and hey, is that clock right?"
"GIRL 3: What do you mean by timing?"
"GIRL 1: Yeah, if you had waited and had a baby with another man at a different time. . ."
"GIRL 4: It wouldn't have been Rory, right?"
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what's fun to talk about? Late checkout."
"GIRL 2: But it was good you got pregnant when you did because you got Rory."
"LORELAI: Look, you guys, this is a very important subject, and I promise that another time I would love to take you all for a cup of coffee and, and talk about . . .if you should even be allowed to drink coffee because coffee is for older. . . [sighs] . . .Butch Danes, everybody."
"CUT TO LANE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is standing in the hallway; Lane laughs excitedly from inside the bathroom]"
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: It's perfect, I love it."
"RORY: Well, stop primping and get out here. [Lane opens the door and reveals her purple hair] Whoa."
"LANE: It's everything I hoped it would be."
"RORY: It's very rock and roll."
"LANE: We've gotta take a picture."
"RORY: Get the camera."
"LANE: I am a Kodak picture spot."
"[they run to Lane's bedroom]"
"LANE: Should I scowl or smile?"
"RORY: Surprise me."
"LANE: This is the most radical thing a Kim has done since my cousin Nam got caught reading Maxim at summer camp."
"[Rory takes Lane's picture, then they hear the front door open]"
"RORY: That must be your mom. Lane? Lane, you're turning white. What's wrong? Lane!"
"LANE: I can't do this."
"RORY: Can't do what?"
"LANE: Dye my hair."
"RORY: Um, it's kinda too late."
"LANE: This is gonna k*ll her."
"RORY: It won't k*ll her, it'll just shock her."
"LANE: But the shock will k*ll her and then she'll k*ll me, we're talking bloodbath here. We've gotta put it back."
"RORY: Put it back?"
"LANE: Back to black, right now, hurry! Go, go!"
"RORY: Go where?"
"LANE: Back to the store to get the black hair dye."
"RORY: No!"
"LANE: Yes!"
"RORY: No!"
"LANE: Yes!"
"RORY: This is insane."
"LANE: Rory, I just drank a gallon of liquid salad. Insanity is a daily staple at the Kim house. Go, go!"
"RORY: Okay, I'm going. [walks to the door]"
"LANE: Where are you going?"
"RORY: You're messing with my mind here."
"LANE: You can't go out that way, my mom will see you."
"RORY: My head is my normal color, she can see me."
"LANE: But if she sees you, she'll come looking for me. [points to the window]"
"RORY: You owe me."
"LANE: Big time forever. Now make like the wind. Go go, go go go go!"
"CUT TO BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE"
"[Rory shops for the hair dye as Shane talks on the phone at the counter]"
"SHANE: [on phone] Uh huh. . .All I know is I don't have it, so it's gotta be at your place. . .You're not looking for it, you're watching TV, I can tell. . .Yeah, whatever. I'll just get a new one. So, what are we doing tonight? . . . I don't know, I'm sick of eating. I've been eating like a pig, I feel all bloaty. . . It is so a word, it's a word cause I said it. That's how words get invented, cause people say them and then other people say them. . . You're such a jerk sometimes and I'm always nice to you. . ."
"[Rory is waiting at the counter for Shane to help her]"
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"SHANE: [on phone] I get off at the same boring time."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"SHANE: Yeah?"
"RORY: I don't have all day."
"SHANE: [on phone] Hold on a sec. [to Rory] Will this be all?"
"RORY: Yeah, that'll be all. I'm growing a beard here."
"SHANE: What's your problem?"
"RORY: What's your problem? I'm a customer, I'm in a hurry, and you're supposed to assist me."
"SHANE: I am assisting you."
"RORY: Yeah, after you took your sweet time getting off the phone, which by the way, clearly was not a business call."
"SHANE: Un-freaking-believable."
"RORY: Yeah, it is, it is. The level of service in this place is just that  un-freaking-believable."
"SHANE: Have a nice day."
"RORY: Yeah, thanks, you too. And by the way, bloaty is not a word. There's bloated, there's bloating, but no bloaty."
"SHANE: Thanks, that's fascinating."
"RORY: Well, for you, how ice is made is probably fascinating. See ya."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Luke are walking down the street. Luke is laughing]"
"LORELAI: Don't."
"LUKE: I'm trying not to, I swear. [laughs] I'm not trying hard, I'll grant you that."
"LORELAI: What was with those kids? So curious, so full of questions. Shouldn't their brains be completely fried on TV and video games by now?"
"[Luke laughs again]"
"LORELAI: It wasn't funny."
"LUKE: Not from your angle. From mine, it was an evening at the Improv."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna be allowed within a mile of the school ever again."
"LUKE: On the positive side, you did me a favor. Now I have a pleasant memory from that school  you being nailed like a two by four by a group of sixteen-year-olds."
"[Lorelai sees Debbie and a group of women walking toward them]"
"LORELAI: Oh no, what's this?"
"LUKE: Looks like high noon in Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: They're not carrying tar and feathers, are they?"
"[the women walk up to them]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hi everybody. Wow, the whole gang. What's up?"
"DEBBIE: Well, I felt obligated to tell the other moms about your little performance at school before they heard about it elsewhere."
"LORELAI: Really, cause usually I like to meet up at Sardi's after a performance, wait for the reviews. I hope The Times liked me. Nothing, huh?"
"LADY 1: So, you're preaching to our daughters that it's okay to get pregnant at sixteen, am I getting that right?"
"LORELAI: No, not at all, I was just answering their questions."
"LADY 1: Well, it's your answers we didn't like."
"LORELAI: Hey, I was talking about my job like I was supposed to, but your kids kept asking about my pregnancy. What was I supposed to do?"
"DEBBIE: Fend them off, change the subject!"
"LORELAI: I tried, Debbie, but they kept coming at me like I was Poland and they were n*zi. Remember the old days, girls, when I used to make you laugh?"
"LADY 2: There's nothing funny about this."
"LORELAI: Their questions just threw me off, that's all."
"LADY 1: Sounds like you just flaunted your mistakes."
"LORELAI: Now, hold on. You have no right to judge me. All I said was that for my particular circumstances things worked out okay. I advocated nothing to them. You're all acting like I walked into that room tossing condoms in the air."
"LADY 2: You might as well have."
"LORELAI: Fine, next time I will. I'll bring a banana and we'll have a little show and tell. How bout that?"
"LADY 1: What kind of mother are you?"
"LORELAI: The kind that doesn't gloss over things just because they're a little uncomfortable."
"DEBBIE: This whole incident was awkward and unnecessary."
"LORELAI: No, Deb, I'd say, Deb, that what's awkward and unnecessary, Deb, is that you all seem to go to the same lousy hairdresser. How bout mixing it up a little, huh, girls?"
"LUKE: I gotta get going. You good here?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, I'm good."
"DEBBIE: You don't have to take that tone."
"LORELAI: You ambush me, then you're offended by my tone?"
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Jess is looking out the window as Luke walks in]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"JESS: Hey. So what's going on out there?"
"LUKE: Ah, just Lorelai. . .dealing with some women about something or other. So we did that thing at the school today. [Luke looks behind a chair] Yeah, it went pretty well. All the kids seemed relatively unarmed. [he looks into the closet] Yeah, I just told them about the diner and cooking things, and I expect kids all over town will rush out tomorrow and buy a spatula."
"JESS: Checking for monsters?"
"LUKE: Oh, no, just. . ."
"JESS: Just what?"
"LUKE: Just didn't wanna accidentally bump into someone in there."
"JESS: What are you talking about?"
"LUKE: Jess, did you have a girl stashed in there before?"
"JESS: Before what?"
"LUKE: Lorelai said you were hiding someone here earlier, she said a girl  were you?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: Jess, you don't shove a girl in a closet."
"JESS: I did not shove her in the closet. She got in voluntarily."
"LUKE: Oh, sure."
"JESS: Look, Shane freaked when she heard you guys coming. Next thing I know, she's in there. I personally didn't care if you guys saw us or not, but hey  women, right? You can't live with them, you can't keep them from jumping in the closet."
"LUKE: Uh, you and I have got to have a little talk."
"JESS: Hey, if you're gonna get all Ward Cleaver on me, I gotta go call Eddie and Lumpy and tell them I'm gonna be late."
"LUKE: Shut up for a second, would ya? Look, I know you're at an age where the whole girl thing is. . .you know, on your mind a lot, and it's probably not helping you to think straight with all the hormones and other things that are raging around in there. My point is that you gotta think about things a little better, you know, the way you act. I mean, if you care about a girl the way you do with this Shane "
"JESS: I don't care about her."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: I don't even know her last name."
"LUKE: You're kidding."
"JESS: She mentioned it once. It didn't stick."
"LUKE: Well, if you don't care about her, what are you doing with her?"
"JESS: Just hanging with her, no biggie."
"LUKE: Well, you gotta be doing something more than hanging with her. I mean, you got to at least be doing something with her to make her jump in a closet when people come into the room."
"JESS: Relax, will ya? All is good."
"LUKE: Jess, this isn't right. You can't treat a girl like this, like dirt!"
"JESS: If it's any consolation to you, she treats me like dirt, too. It's a pretty symbiotic relationship."
"LUKE: And that's fine with you?"
"JESS: Yes, it is."
"LUKE: To just go along in a relationship, you treat somebody bad and they treat you bad back."
"JESS: That's right."
"LUKE: Oh, that makes you happy?"
"JESS: I'd do backflips but I am way too cool."
"LUKE: That makes absolutely no sense."
"JESS: It doesn't have to make sense to you."
"LUKE: There are plenty other of girls out there in the world, Jess."
"JESS: Don't you have to get back to the diner?"
"LUKE: I mean, you can go out and at least find one that you actually care about."
"JESS: Oh, like it's that easy."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's that easy if you try."
"JESS: Hey, the girls that I like don't give a damn about me! And unlike some other people I know, I'm not gonna sit around hoping that they change their minds and suddenly notice me."
"LUKE: What's that supposed to mean?"
"JESS: You fixed any neighbor's porches lately? Or you go on a picnic or you get rooked into giving a ridiculous speech at a high school?"
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: At least I've got a little self-esteem."
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: I'm not playing Golden Retriever, hoping one day she'll turn around and fall in my arms. If she doesn't wanna be with me, then fine."
"LUKE: You have no idea what you're talking about."
"JESS: Whatever. I gotta go, Shane's waiting."
"LUKE: Oh, you mean what's-her-name?"
"JESS: Yeah, I'll bring you a new leash when I get back."
"LUKE: Get outta here."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"LANE: Busy day, busy day."
"RORY: I'm pretty exhausted."
"LANE: I guess it was just too big of a statement for me to make right now."
"RORY: Maybe. Oh, hey, I just thought of something."
"LANE: What?"
"RORY: Technically, you have dyed hair."
"LANE: I do, don't I?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LANE: I mean, dyed my natural color, yes  but dyed nonetheless."
"RORY: Not one strand of real color on that head of yours."
"LANE: So, I guess that means we can score this as a victory, right?"
"RORY: Absolutely, put it in the victory column."
"[Jess and Shane walk past them]"
"SHANE: That girl's a freak."
"LANE: What was that about?"
"RORY: It's been a very long day."
"[Lorelai walks up to them]"
"LORELAI: Ah, people who like me, great."
"RORY: How was your talk at the school?"
"LORELAI: Oh, just peachy. [to Lane] Is your hair blacker?"
"LANE: Uh oh."
"RORY: Oh, I wish you hadn't have said that. It's not noticeable, but just stay out of bright lighting."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"LANE: I dyed my hair."
"LORELAI: Uh!"
"LANE: Then I dyed it back, but for a full thirty minutes, I looked like this. [pulls out the picture]"
"LORELAI: Whoa, you look cool! You're insane."
"LANE: I got sane again, but I will always have that picture. Oh, uh, hide it at your place?"
"LORELAI: Will do."
"LANE: I gotta go. And remember, we still need a plan."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do."
"[Lane leaves]"
"LORELAI: Why do we need a plan?"
"RORY: A plan so that Lane doesn't have to quit her band."
"LORELAI: Lane can't quit the band! She has to get famous and introduce me to Bono."
"RORY: I told her that."
"LORELAI: All right, let's go eat. . .see if we can figure out a way to salvage my future as a groupie."
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: Let's go to Al's Pancake World for a change. He's doing a salute to Jamaica again."
"RORY: Okay, as long as Al doesn't play the kettle drums all night."
"LORELAI: We'll hide his mallets when he's not looking."
"RORY: So, come on, tell me how the talk went."
"LORELAI: Oh, it was great. It was one minute on my success in the business world, and that went very well. And it was ten minutes on the possibility that if I had had sex with a different man at a different time in my life, you wouldn't have been born."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I kind of got off on a tangent."
"RORY: A big one. How did that happen?"
"LORELAI: I'll tell you about it at Al's. Just don't expect to be invited to any more swim parties at Kathy Fincher's house."
"RORY: Well, don't wait til Al's. Tell me now."
"LORELAI: Oh, I just love my little fluke."
"RORY: Come on, what happened?"
"LORELAI: All right. Well, it started off really good and then all these kids started asking me all these questions, you know, about like. . . ."

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street toward the diner]"
"LORELAI: And the rabbit says, How about that schnitzel!' Well?"
"RORY: Well what? There's no punchline."
"LORELAI: That is the punchline."
"RORY: How about that schnitzel!'  that's the punchline?"
"LORELAI: Well, no, not when you say it like that."
"RORY: How am I supposed to say it?"
"LORELAI: Like a punchline."
"RORY: How about that schnitzel!"
"LORELAI: Oh, forget it."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You ruined my joke."
"RORY: Um, no, the punchline ruined your joke."
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You admit it's a punchline."
"RORY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Ha, I am vindicated. How about that schnitzel!' has officially been declared a punchline."
"RORY: A really bad punchline."
"LORELAI: No one asked for the Norton Critical Edition. All the schnitzel and I wanted was some recognition and now we have it."
"[they walk into Luke's Diner]"
"LORELAI: Oh, man, it's packed in here."
"RORY: I guess we counter it."
"LORELAI: Oh, I guess we do."
"[they sit down at the counter]"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: What do you know, your face really can freeze that way."
"RORY: Are you okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm great. It's a big fat happy sunshine day for me."
"LORELAI: Business looks good."
"RORY: Yeah, the place is packed."
"LUKE: Sure, it's been taken over by the J. Crew catalog."
"[Several families with little kids are seated at the tables]"
"RORY: Oh, look, babies!"
"LORELAI: I never wanna hear that come out of your mouth again."
"WOMAN: Find the yellow ball."
"MAN: [searching through a diaper bag] Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball. . .ah, yellow duck."
"WOMAN: Ball."
"MAN: Yellow ball, yellow ball, yellow ball."
"LUKE: Every weekend, the same stupid group comes in here and take up all my tables and every chair they can get their sticky hands on, and they do that. They sit, they stand, one person holds the kid, another person holds the kid."
"MAN 2: I've got Choo-Choo Joe."
"LUKE: This guy runs in and out and back and forth, the other guy never takes his head out of that stupid bag, the women can't figure out which kid is which, and they do it all morning long, and then order two iced teas to go, and that is it."
"LORELAI: I'm sure you're exaggerating."
"LUKE: I am not exaggerating."
"WOMAN 2: Oh god."
"LUKE: Oh, now, this is good, you see  Choo-Choo Joe will not be working."
"WOMAN 2: Get the Bongo Bear. Get the Bongo Bear."
"RORY: How'd you know that?"
"LUKE: Because Joe has not been working for the last six months. Personally, I don't think he's broken, I think he k*ll himself to get away from that family."
"LORELAI: Oh, now that kid's a major drooler."
"RORY: Yeah, it's like a fountain."
"LUKE: Okay, that's it, they have to go."
"LORELAI: Luke, come on, it's just spit. Pretend you're at a baseball game."
"LUKE: No no no, I've had enough. Let them go not spend money at Al's, I'm through."
"[He starts to walk toward the people when a woman stands up and starts unbuttoning her shirt. Luke walks back to Lorelai and Rory]"
"LUKE: Is that woman doing what I think she's doing?"
"[the woman has started nursing her baby]"
"LORELAI: Um, well, I can't be a hundred percent sure, but. . .oh yeah, that's lunch."
"LUKE: Why, why do they do this? This is a public place, people are eating here."
"RORY: They sure are."
"LUKE: This cannot be sanitary."
"LORELAI: I agree. You don't know where that thing's been."
"LUKE: When did that become acceptable? In the old days, a woman would never consider doing that in public. They'd go find a barn or a cave or something. I mean, it's indecent. This is a diner not a peep show!"
"LORELAI: Hey, consider making it a combo. You could charge more for your cheeseburgers. Of course, no one would ever feel the same ordering a glass of milk again, but . . ."
"LUKE: I have to do something. I just can't stand here and let the lactating continue."
"LORELAI: Luke."
"RORY: Gross!"
"LUKE: I'm gross? I'm not the one exposing myself for the entire world to see. That's it."
"[Luke starts to walk over to the woman, then walks back to the counter]"
"LUKE: You go make her stop."
"LORELAI: I'm not going over there."
"LUKE: Why not? You're a woman."
"LORELAI: So what?"
"LUKE: So you have the same parts."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You shouldn't be scared of it."
"LORELAI: Scared of it? You know, you're gonna be a bachelor for a really long time."
"LUKE: I am being taken advantage of here, and I do not like being taken advantage of. I hate this!"
"[Jess walks down into the diner and sees the woman nursing]"
"JESS: Oh geez!"
"[Jess quickly turns around and walks back upstairs]"
"LUKE: Okay, well, that was kind of fun."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks into the lobby as Michel walks in from another direction carrying some pillows]"
"LORELAI: Aw, is it your nap time?"
"MICHEL: The Tylers in twelve asked to have their toxic pillows removed."
"LORELAI: Our pillows aren't toxic."
"MICHEL: According to the complimentary travel magazine that we put in their room, down pillows can carry airborne diseases and mold."
"LORELAI: Unbelievable  I didn't think anyone ever read those magazines."
"MICHEL: I think she had to, there was a picture of a roast chicken on the cover."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: She is large."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: And her husband in ugly."
"LORELAI: Hey!"
"MICHEL: They threw pillows at me!"
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Independence inn."
"EMILY: You really should identify yourself when you answer the phone at work."
"LORELAI: Sorry. Independence Inn, major disappointment speaking. Better?"
"EMILY: Yes, thank you. Now I wanna talk to you about something."
"LORELAI: sh**t."
"EMILY: I'm in charge of the Society Matron's League's annual antique auction next Tuesday and I thought maybe you'd like to come."
"LORELAI: Society Matron's League? That's quite a name."
"EMILY: And what is wrong with that name, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Nothing, it just sounds so serious. Brings to mind a room full of old ladies wearing black dresses and cameos and pushing spoonfuls of cod liver oil on the kids."
"EMILY: That's a very flattering portrait of my friends you're painting."
"LORELAI: I didn't mean your friends. I meant the other old ladies in the league, the ones who don't like you and your friends cause you guys are so young."
"EMILY: Kindly wrap this up soon, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Consider it wrapped."
"EMILY: Thank you. As I was saying, all the proceeds from the auction go to the children's hospital, and we're going to be offering some lovely pieces which I think would like very nice in that inn of yours."
"LORELAI: What sort of pieces?"
"EMILY: Basically a lot canes and shawls, a couple of walkers. I believe we finally talked Old Lady Rollins into giving up her teeth."
"LORELAI: What sort of pieces, Mom?"
"EMILY: We have a couple of wonderful writing desks, and some French end tables, rocking chairs, picture frames, lamps, davenports."
"LORELAI: Well"
"EMILY: The worst that can happen is you won't find anything you like and you've wasted a couple of hours. And who knows, you might find something you love. Plus, I will be way too busy to sit with you if that is of concern."
"LORELAI: That is not a concern. Define way too busy.'"
"EMILY: Are you interested or not?"
"LORELAI: When is this auction?"
"EMILY: Tuesday at one o'clock."
"LORELAI: I'll think about it."
"EMILY: I'll see you Tuesday."
"LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up]"
"MICHEL: I'm sorry, did I hear you mention something about an auction?"
"LORELAI: Uh, my mother's women's group is having one next week."
"MICHEL: Oh, well, you know  I love a good auction. The drama, the strategy."
"LORELAI: The strategy?"
"MICHEL: Oh, yes. First, you mustn't be too eager because that drives the price way up."
"LORELAI: Don't be too eager, got it."
"MICHEL: And you must always be extremely careful of your paddle movements."
"LORELAI: Well, that certainly calls for a ""Dirty!"""
"MICHEL: Mm, how's your arm raise? Good?"
"LORELAI: Pretty good."
"MICHEL: Ah, I have an excellent arm raise."
"LORELAI: That's what it says on the bathroom wall."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, if you need some tips. . ."
"LORELAI: I'll give you a call."
"MICHEL: Good. Take me to the auction!"
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: Take me, I insist you take me!"
"LORELAI: You don't even know if it's gonna be any good. It's just a bunch of society women."
"MICHEL: If your mother's involved, it will be impeccable and I haven't been to an impeccable auction in over a year."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know."
"MICHEL: What do you want?"
"LORELAI: Michel, I don't want anything."
"MICHEL: Stop playing coy with me. I want into that auction, you name your price."
"LORELAI: Okay, you have to work weekends for the rest of this month."
"MICHEL: Done."
"LORELAI: And you have to answer the phone when it rings."
"MICHEL: Done."
"LORELAI: And you have to answer it in English, unless the person is actually foreign."
"MICHEL: Done."
"LORELAI: And you have to oversee the nature hikers next week."
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: Michel, if you wanna go to this auction, you have to be in the lobby at six o'clock Friday morning. You have to hand out towels and water bottles, you have to show them the hiking trails, and you have to let them give you a nature name."
"MICHEL: Fine, I will let them give me a nature name."
"LORELAI: All right, then, you can come."
"MICHEL: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Buttercup."
"MICHEL: You cannot give them suggestions!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory get out of the Jeep; Lorelai is carrying a pizza, Rory is carrying a brown takeout bag]"
"RORY: I can't believe you got into a fight with Pete."
"LORELAI: Hey, you do not suddenly decide that garlic is an extra topping, not after five years, not after all we've been through. We single-handedly helped Pete pay for that new delivery truck of his, and I thought he needed to be reminded of that fact."
"RORY: Very loudly."
"LORELAI: Not that loudly."
"RORY: Dogs started barking."
"LORELAI: Because they heard about the garlic incident, and no one likes getting screwed, Rory, not even a Schnauzer. Pete's a swindler. He takes advantage of single mothers and their innocent children and for that, he must pay  what?"
"RORY: He gave us free cheesy bread."
"LORELAI: He did? Oh!"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: I love the cheesy bread."
"RORY: I know you do."
"LORELAI: It's all hot, too."
"RORY: Now doesn't someone feel a little silly?"
"LORELAI: Me?"
"RORY: Should we call Pete tonight?"
"LORELAI: Okay, after cheesy bread."
"RORY: Fine, after the cheesy bread."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna go get the mail  go on inside."
"RORY: Okay, I'm gonna go melt some more cheese on the pizza."
"LORELAI: Melt away."
"[Rory goes inside. Lorelai walks to the mailbox as a man walks across the yard]"
"DWIGHT: Hey! Hello there, neighbor!"
"LORELAI: Hi. I'm sorry, are we neighbors?"
"DWIGHT: Yes, yes we are. I just moved in across the way."
"LORELAI: Oh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Beenie Morrison's old place."
"DWIGHT: That's right, Beenie Morrison's old place."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"DWIGHT: Beenie Morrison's old place. I live in Beenie Morrison's old place. Isn't that great?"
"LORELAI: Only if Beenie Morrison didn't want to live there anymore."
"DWIGHT: Oh no, I paid him a very good price. Overpaid, actually, but it was worth it. I've been dreaming about a place like Beenie Morrison's old place for a long time, and then I found it. I'm sorry, I'm just really excited."
"LORELAI: That's okay, it's nice."
"DWIGHT: It's a great neighborhood."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"DWIGHT: Everyone's so friendly. Babette  do you know Babette?"
"LORELAI: Everybody knows Babette."
"DWIGHT: Oh, she's a great lady. Oh, uh, anyhow, I'm Dwight."
"LORELAI: I'm Lorelai. And if you see a teen walking around with a halo and a book, that's my daughter Rory."
"DWIGHT: Very nice to meet you, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Nice to meet you too, Dwight. Welcome to the neighborhood. If there's anything I can do to help out, let me know."
"DWIGHT: Really?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"DWIGHT: Well, that's great. Actually, I have this little favor I'd love to ask."
"LORELAI: Oh, right now?"
"DWIGHT: Well, this week. You know, I just got this beautiful lawn put in, really amazing shade of green, and the guy who put it in for me, he told me that I have to keep each bade of grass very moist for the first few days while the roots take, but I have to go on a business trip for a few days. Huh, last minute, and believe me, I tried to get out of it but my boss said, Dwight, get off your keister and go make us some money', so I gotta go."
"LORELAI: Well, sure, when the word keister's being thrown around, what are you gonna do?"
"DWIGHT: Exactly. So I was wondering if maybe you could water my lawn?"
"LORELAI: Oh."
"DWIGHT: Only for a few days. You know, a little in the morning, a little in the late afternoon or evening, depending on your schedule. It would be a really big favor."
"LORELAI: Uh, well, I guess, I could water your lawn, Dwight  sure."
"DWIGHT: Boy, that is something. If I would have asked somebody back where I used to live to water my lawn, I would've gotten a much more HBO kind of answer. I love it here! Uh, so, uh, can you come on over now?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"DWIGHT: So I can show you where the on/off nozzle is. It'll only take a second."
"LORELAI: Oh, my daughter's waiting inside for me, I "
"DWIGHT: Oh, uh, well, we can do it tomorrow before I leave."
"LORELAI: Great. What time are you leaving tomorrow?"
"DWIGHT: Six a.m."
"LORELAI: Now sounds fine."
"DWIGHT: That's so terrific. Uh, follow me."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Lorelai follows Dwight across the yard]"
"DWIGHT: You just gotta go over here and make a right."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know where it is."
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai follows Dwight up the front pathway of his house]"
"DWIGHT: Welcome to The Oasis! That's what I named this place, The Oasis, my oasis, a little slice of heaven right here on Earth. Gosh, I swear, I still can't believe I'm here. I was in a terrible marriage, you know."
"LORELAI: Actually, I didn't."
"DWIGHT: Oh, yeah, horrible, like a punishment out of Greek mythology. The women had five heads, suffering, agony. You know, I used to be taller?"
"LORELAI: Really, she shrunk you?"
"DWIGHT: I used to have more hair, too."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"DWIGHT: And higher arches."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"DWIGHT: But through all the screaming and the name calling, the berating and the humiliation, somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew someday I would have it  my oasis. Oh, that's what got me through. That's what kept me from sticking my head through a plate glass window every night when I got home."
"LORELAI: Well, that's a really nice story, Dwight. It's very inspiring and. . .oh, hey, this looks like it does something."
"DWIGHT: Huh? Oh, uh, yeah, this is the on/off spigot."
"LORELAI: Aha."
"DWIGHT: You just turn it to the right for on."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"DWIGHT: And the left for off."
"LORELAI: Seems simple."
"DWIGHT: It's very simple."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, twice a day."
"DWIGHT: Yeah, for a good fifteen minute soaking."
"LORELAI: I will soak my best."
"DWIGHT: I really appreciate it."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, you have a good trip."
"DWIGHT: I owe ya."
"[Lorelai walks back to her house; Rory is waiting on the porch]"
"RORY: Where have you been?"
"LORELAI: Get in the house."
"RORY: I thought you were gonna go get the mail."
"LORELAI: Go, go, go!"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Don't look around, stare straight ahead, no more talking to people ever!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"[Lorelai pushes Rory into the house]"
"CUT TO AUCTION"
"[An auctioneer stands on a stage running the auction; Lorelai and Michel are sitting in the audience.]"
"AUCTIONEER: Next up, we have an occasional table from a distinguished, family-owned company in Vermont, circa 1912. We shall start the bidding at two hundred-fifty dollars. Do I hear two-fifty? Two hundred fifty, thank you."
"LORELAI: Wow, lots of garbage at these things."
"MICHEL: Always. You've got to be patient and wait for what you want to appear, then pounce."
"LORELAI: Hm, true at an auction, true at a singles bar."
"MICHEL: To put it crudely, yes."
"LORELAI: Crap, crap, crap that makes the previous two items not seem like crap."
"MICHEL: Could you keep your crap commentaries to yourself?"
"AUCTIONEER: Four hundred dollars, we have four hundred, four hundred  going once, going twice, sold to bidder number sixty-five."
"LORELAI: Aw, wow, that was a good table."
"MICHEL: It was a good table, not a great table."
"LORELAI: We should've gone for it."
"MICHEL: Too expensive and too many scratches."
"LORELAI: We could've buffed the scratches out."
"MICHEL: Look, if you want it that bad, it's quite obvious that the buyer's children will be selling it at his probate in the very near future."
"LORELAI: You're awful."
"MICHEL: And he's old, now be quiet."
"[Emily walks over to them]"
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey Mom, you remember Michel?"
"EMILY: Yes, from the inn."
"MICHEL: Hello Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: Didn't you see me waving at you before?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"EMILY: You didn't wave back."
"LORELAI: It's dangerous to wave at an auction. You didn't see before, but when you waved you bought a motorcycle and a sidecar."
"EMILY: I did not."
"LORELAI: Circa 1912. Now would you drive it or would you sit in the sidecar?"
"[A woman walks up to them]"
"NATALIE: There she is, the Cobra."
"EMILY: Oh, now, Natalie."
"LORELAI: The what?"
"NATALIE: This woman gets her way or she squeezes til you comply."
"LORELAI: Like a superhero."
"EMILY: Ignore her, Natalie is just being Natalie. My daughter, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Nice to meet you."
"NATALIE: Your mother's got such spunk. You must love her."
"LORELAI: I think she'd squeeze me to death if I didn't."
"EMILY: Natalie, you're embarrassing me."
"NATALIE: Oh, hush, Emily. Listen to this. . . our auctioneer calls in sick this morning, they are such flakes, and what is an auction without an auctioneer?"
"LORELAI: Just a bunch of nuts with paddles surrounded by mismatched furniture?"
"NATALIE: Exactly. But your mother got on the horn with that lazy Charlie and she squeezed and squeezed til  voila  he suddenly felt better. The Cobra."
"LORELAI: The Cobra."
"EMILY: Oh, now, stop it."
"NATALIE: You're humble, don't be. Nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"NATALIE: Edna's group wants to give you kudos, too, Emily. Make sure to swing by."
"EMILY: I will."
"[Natalie leaves]"
"EMILY: I should make the rounds. Say goodbye before you leave."
"LORELAI: Hm, I will, Cobra."
"EMILY: Stop it."
"LORELAI: It goes with the motorcycle thing, too."
"[Emily walks away, Lorelai sits down]"
"AUCTIONEER: Do I have two hundred-fifty? Two hundred-fifty, thank you. Do I have three hundred? Three hundred, thank you very much."
"LORELAI: Oh, is this our end tables?"
"MICHEL: Shh!"
"AUCTIONEER: Moving on to three-fifty? Three-fifty, do we have four?"
"LORELAI: Let me do the paddle."
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: I just wanna hold it, it's still your thing."
"MICHEL: I'm losing my concentration."
"LORELAI: Fine. I'm gonna go get a drink."
"MICHEL: Please."
"AUCTIONEER: Do we have five hundred?"
"[Lorelai walks up to the bar as a man is ordering a drink]"
"PEYTON: Can I get a Merlot, please?"
"BARTENDER: Yes sir."
"LORELAI: Oh, that sounds great, make it two."
"BARTENDER: [pouring drink] Got just enough for one and this is the last of the red, sorry."
"LORELAI: Aw. I'll give you two bucks for it."
"BARTENDER: They're free."
"LORELAI: Which makes two bucks a great offer, and this is an auction, right?"
"BARTENDER: Yes."
"PEYTON: Three."
"BARTENDER: What?"
"PEYTON: I'll give you three for it."
"LORELAI: Four."
"PEYTON: Five."
"LORELAI: Six."
"PEYTON: Six-fifty"
"LORELAI: Ooh, losing steam."
"PEYTON: Just weighing cost versus benefit."
"LORELAI: Well, you've gotta think about these things."
"PEYTON: How about this? Can I get an empty glass?"
"BARTENDER: Yes, sir."
"[Peyton pours some of the wine into the second glass]"
"LORELAI: Aw. You're the Solomon of wine."
"PEYTON: Everybody's gotta be something. I got a few things coming up that I'm bidding on."
"LORELAI: Oh, oh. Great, the bartender and I are the only ones in the building that don't get to hold a paddle."
"PEYTON: Why don't you put a bid on one of the paddles?"
"LORELAI: What would I use to bid on it?"
"PEYTON: I'm Solomon, not Einstein."
"LORELAI: Bye Solomon."
"[Peyton walks away as the bartender pulls out another bottle of wine]"
"BARTENDER: Oops, I had a spare bottle all the time."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks. This was better."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen while talking on the phone]"
"LORELAI: Hi, yes, I was at your auction yesterday and I was wondering if you could help me. Um, I met a man there and I would like to contact him but I didn't get his name and I wondered if you could look it up for me. He was paddle number seventeen, and. . .Oh right, confidential, got it. . .Well, you know, actually, I misspoke earlier because this isn't a complete stranger I'm trying to contact here, he's an old friend from school. . . Good question. Well, I don't know his name because I only knew him by his nickname. . .Uh, Shamu. We called him Shamu. He was kind of, um, a big guy in high school, but he's slimmed down quite a bit. . .No, see, I don't have time to contact the high school alumni committee because time is of the essence. . . See, Shamu and I went to a liquor store after the auction and we bought a lottery ticket together and we tore it and I took half and he took half, and I'll be damned if the thing didn't win! . . .Fourteen million dollars! . . .Really, but see, we have to claim it by four p.m. today or we forfeit. . .Ah, yes. . .Oh, well, but there's one more thing that I forgot to tell you. See, um, my blood type is o-negative and he's o-negative and I have a medical condition that. . .All right, then. Well, thank you anyway. Bye. [hangs up]"
"RORY: So. . ."
"LORELAI: Yes?"
"RORY: You ran into your old friend Shamu?"
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"RORY: And you won millions of dollars?"
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: And you need a transfusion?"
"LORELAI: I'm just trying to get the name of a really cool guy I met at this auction, but they won't give it to me."
"RORY: Wow, that's a lot of effort. Must've been cute."
"LORELAI: And witty  you don't meet that everyday."
"RORY: You know who would have his name?"
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: Grandma."
"LORELAI: Ah, no, she only knows the Bitty's, she doesn't know the young ones."
"RORY: She knows everyone at these kinds of things. You know Grandma."
"LORELAI: I cannot ask her for this."
"RORY: Then kiss Shamu goodbye."
"LORELAI: But maybe you could ask her."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Come on, ask her, do me a favor!"
"RORY: You want me to ask Grandma for the name of a man that I didn't meet at a function that I didn't attend?"
"LORELAI: I'll share my lottery winnings with you."
"RORY: It's ridiculously transparent."
"LORELAI: Fourteen million dollars."
"RORY: But you're sharing half with him and taxes will take a huge chunk, and oh yeah  you didn't win the lottery. Ask her yourself."
"LORELAI: You're mean."
"RORY: Did you call information and ask them for paddle seventeen's listing?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily and Richard are eating dinner]"
"EMILY: What do you think of the pork? Rory?"
"RORY: It's good."
"EMILY: I'm not sure. Richard?"
"RICHARD: It's fine."
"EMILY: I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: It's really good, Mom."
"EMILY: Yes, well, I'm not sure."
"RICHARD: Pork is bred leaner these days. It has a different taste. Less fat equals less flavor. Yet another example of the great advances man has made, flavorless pork. Hurrah for the opposable thumbs."
"EMILY: All right, enough talk about pork. Please, someone change the subject."
"RORY: Mom had a really good time at the auction the other day."
"EMILY: Did you?"
"LORELAI: Yes, yes, I did."
"EMILY: Well, I'm glad. Did you see anything you liked?"
"RORY: Yeah, Mom, anything look good to you there?"
"LORELAI: Yes, actually, I, uh, bought a couple of end tables for the inn."
"EMILY: I must say I was very impressed with the selection this year. I even wound up purchasing a couple of pieces for myself."
"RICHARD: Yes, how nice to have yet another chair you can't sit in."
"EMILY: It's one hundred years old."
"RICHARD: Wonderful. We can put it next to the two-hundred-year-old footstool you can't put your foot on."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard, please."
"RICHARD: I'm only teasing, Emily. It is one of the great pleasures of my life to be able to surround you with a house full of useless objects. No, I'm never happier than when we're standing in the corner staring at our furniture."
"EMILY: Eat your pork, please."
"RORY: You know, I believe there was something at the auction that Mom wanted but she didn't get. Isn't that right, Mom?"
"EMILY: Oh really? What was that?"
"LORELAI: I think it was a steamer trunk for Rory to take with her to military school, wasn't it, honey?"
"EMILY: I don't remember a steamer trunk, but I can check on it for you if you like."
"LORELAI: That's not necessary, Mom. Uh, so, Mom, it was a very nice bunch of people you had at that auction."
"EMILY: Yes, very nice."
"LORELAI: I was surprised at how many young people were there. I mean, you know, younger people. Um, in fact, uh, like, for instance, this guy that I talked to for quite awhile, he was. . .younger."
"EMILY: What man was that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I didn't get his name, but he was a nice looking guy. He had a gray suit and he was paddle number seventeen. He likes Merlot."
"EMILY: Are you talking about Peyton Sanders?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know, maybe."
"EMILY: Wait one second, I'll look it up."
"LORELAI: Oh, no no no, Mom, you don't have to . . .she's looking it up."
"EMILY: Paddle number seventeen, Peyton Sanders."
"LORELAI: Oh great, oh, Peyton Sanders. Well, that's great that it's Peyton Sanders. . . cause that's, uh, great. How well do you know this Peyton Sanders?"
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Why do you wanna know how well I know Peyton Sanders?"
"LORELAI: I don't wanna know. I was just mentioning that he was, you know, seemed. . .uh, you know. . ."
"EMILY: Young."
"LORELAI: Yes, young. Okay, Mom, uh, Peyton and I kind of hit it off and I wondered if you possibly had his number. . .okay, there, I said it. Pass the flavorless pork."
"EMILY: You're asking me for his number?"
"LORELAI: If it's not a big deal, then yes."
"EMILY: Well, well, well. Richard, Lorelai's asking me for a man's number."
"RICHARD: So I heard."
"LORELAI: But if it's a big deal, forget it."
"EMILY: It's not a big deal at all. I don't have his number."
"LORELAI: Okay, then, never mind."
"EMILY: I can get his number. Would you like me to get his number?"
"LORELAI: Um, it's up to you."
"EMILY: It can't be up to me. I didn't ask for his number, you asked for his number, therefore it has to be up to you as to whether or not I get his number."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom."
"EMILY: Would you like me to get his number?"
"LORELAI: Yes, if you don't mind."
"EMILY: I don't mind at all."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"EMILY: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: I wasn't kidding about that military school."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai rushes down the steps]"
"LORELAI: Okay, the clock is right! If we hurry, we still have time to hit Luke's for breakfast. What'd I forget?"
"RORY: [rushing into the living room] Pants."
"LORELAI: Uh! Ooh, don't do that. Come on, let's go!"
"RORY: I can't."
"LORELAI: You can't have breakfast? You have to have breakfast."
"RORY: The clock is wrong, I'll miss my bus."
"LORELAI: Forget your bus, I'll drive you to school."
"RORY: You will?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Oh sh**t!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Dwight's lawn."
"RORY: Aw, there goes the breakfast sandwich."
"LORELAI: No, no, let's hurry, we can still do Luke's."
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Let's go!"
"RORY: Agh, my shoes!"
"LORELAI: You don't need shoes! In my day, we walked twenty miles in the snow just to get to our shoes!"
"RORY: Aw, come on."
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up the front pathway.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, come on, sprinkle. [turns on the sprinkler] There, drink up boys, we've got a breakfast to get to."
"[Rory walks to the porch and finds an envelope]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I think this is for you."
"LORELAI: Lorelai? No, it must be someone else. Hey, don't read that. Do not read that. I'm telling you, no good can come from you reading that."
"RORY: Dear Lorelai. . .'"
"LORELAI: And she's reading it."
"RORY: Just a couple of things that came to mind after we talked.'"
"LORELAI: Oh great."
"RORY: First of all, thank you for this very kind favor you're doing me. I still can't believe that any one person would be so kind to someone they just met.'"
"LORELAI: Yeah, apparently Dwight's last home was Oz, and not as in The Wizard Of.'"
"RORY: Second, since you are already coming over to take care of my lawn, I was hoping you wouldn't mind stopping inside and watering my African violets. I have written the directions on a separate piece of paper, there's a key in the planter by the door. Please go in, make yourself at home. I have food in the fridge, satellite TV, and a great collection of board games. My oasis is your oasis.'"
"LORELAI: I'm not going in that house. Rory, do not pick up that key."
"RORY: But we have to water the violets."
"LORELAI: No, I didn't agree to violets. He threw the violets in after he'd already rooked me into watering his lawn."
"RORY: Don't you at least wanna see what his house looks like?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely not. Key, please. Let me just say, if we walk in there and his dead mother is sitting in a rocking chair, not a bit surprised."
"[cut to inside Dwight's house]"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, Dwight."
"RORY: This place is great."
"LORELAI: Someone took the whole lounge craze very seriously."
"[they see a large cabinet filled with board games]"
"RORY: Oh my."
"LORELAI: Oh geez, he wasn't kidding."
"RORY: I have never seen this many board games. He's got Monopoly from every country in the world."
"LORELAI: Hey, when you finally meet him?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Remember he owns Twister  there's a great visual awaiting you."
"RORY: Got it. Hey, how come we don't have a tiki bar?"
"LORELAI: Well, we are not two wild and crazy guys."
"RORY: You like pina coladas."
"LORELAI: And getting lost in the rain."
"RORY: I love it here."
"LORELAI: It's quite a statement, I'll give him that."
"RORY: Hey, African violets."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, right. [cell phone rings] Just a sec. [answers phone] Hello?. . .Hi Peyton, thanks for calling me back. . .Well, I hope it was a good surprise. [whispers to Rory] It was a good surprise."
"RORY: Yay."
"LORELAI: [on phone] You just flew back on your jet, huh? . . .From Maui? Sounds great. . . Yes, I would love to get together with you. . .Um, I'm pretty flexible next week. What'd you have in mind? . . . David Bowie?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I love David Bowie, I would love to go. . . Oh, well, yeah, it is a ways away, but. . .No, I think that sounds just crazy enough."
"RORY: What sounds crazy enough?"
"LORELAI: Well, that sounds great, Peyton. It's a plan. . . I'll see you then, okay, bye. [hangs up] We're having dinner tomorrow."
"RORY: What were you saying about David Bowie?"
"LORELAI: Well, first, he asked me to the David Bowie concert next week."
"RORY: You're so lucky!"
"LORELAI: I know! And once that was set, he said that a week was an awfully long time to wait."
"RORY: He did not."
"LORELAI: So we're having dinner tomorrow."
"RORY: And Bowie next week."
"LORELAI: And Bowie next week."
"RORY: Two dates in one phone call. Talk about not wasting any time."
"LORELAI: He sounds very cool, and not just cause he owns his own jet."
"RORY: Well, remember to tell him that the way to get to you is through your daughter, who desperately wants to go to Amsterdam."
"LORELAI: I will remember."
"RORY: I think this place is lucky."
"LORELAI: I think you may be right. Of course, creepy's the other word that comes to mind."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is getting dressed in the closet as Rory reads on the bed]"
"LORELAI: [from inside the closet] The red skirt is not working."
"RORY: Try the blue."
"LORELAI: Blue let me down ten minutes ago, I think it's conspiring with the red."
"RORY: I wish you'd just wear the dress we picked out this morning."
"LORELAI: No, you know as well as I do, the morning butt and evening butt are two completely different butts."
"RORY: Well, whatever butt you've got tonight had better hurry because he's gonna be here any minute."
"LORELAI: Rats. Fine, okay, striped skirt, g*n sweater, that's it. [walks out of closet] What do you think? And remember, I'm wearing this no matter what because I cannot spend one more second deciding what to wear, so the answer has to be, You look fantastic.'"
"RORY: You look fantastic."
"LORELAI: [grabs a shirt from the bed] Pink and black."
"RORY: With a flippy skirt."
"LORELAI: Grab a necklace?"
"[Lorelai walks back into the closet to change]"
"LORELAI: Um, okay, here is my concern."
"RORY: Voice it."
"LORELAI: Well, you know, I only saw this guy once for like ten minutes and the lighting was only so-so and I hadn't eaten anything, and, like, what if I'm remembering him a lot cuter than he was?"
"RORY: I'm sure you're not."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but what if I am? You know how these things are. You get bored, you need a diversion, so you superimpose a really cute guy's face over a really scary looking guy."
"RORY: Well, then you'll just have to strike up a conversation with him and find out what kind of a man he is beneath the surface."
"LORELAI: What? On the first date  what will he think of me?"
"RORY: Just order an extra dessert."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine. Well?"
"RORY: I like the brown."
"LORELAI: Come here a sec, you've got some dirt on your forehead. I'm sorry, it's just the sign of the devil, my mistake."
"RORY: You look beautiful."
"LORELAI: Thank you. [they hear a car pull up] I think that's him. [they look out the window] Well, the car sure is pretty."
"RORY: Come on."
"[cut to them walking down the stairs]"
"LORELAI: Okay now, if for some reason, he does turn out to have like a horn in the middle of his forehead, you will call me in one hour with a very high fever."
"RORY: Deal."
"LORELAI: God, I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?"
"RORY: Because you're crazy."
"LORELAI: Yes, good, thank you."
"[Lorelai pulls open the door]"
"PEYTON: Hi."
"LORELAI: [to Rory] You're feeling just fine. [to Peyton] Hey Peyton."
"PEYTON: Am I early?"
"LORELAI: No, you're right on time. Peyton, I want you to meet my daughter, Rory."
"PEYTON: It's a pleasure, Rory."
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, don't wait up and remember only two or three crackheads at the most, they eat all the good cereal."
"RORY: Deal. Have fun."
"PEYTON: It was nice meeting you, Rory. [to Lorelai] You look wonderful."
"LORELAI: Oh, so do you Peyton. So do you."
"CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory is in bed, Lorelai knocks on the door]"
"LORELAI: You up?"
"RORY: What time is it?"
"LORELAI: 10:15."
"RORY: Oops."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: What happened? He was hornless."
"[Lorelai sits down on Rory's bed]"
"LORELAI: No, he had no horns, he also had no personality."
"RORY: Yikes."
"LORELAI: And no sense of humor."
"RORY: Gross."
"LORELAI: And no idea how boring he was."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: That's okay. The evening started well enough  that is, until we got to the car. . .a Jaguar XJ8 convertible with a 290 horsepower engine, in case you were wondering. You weren't? Funny, neither was I. However, he told me anyhow. He told me a lot of other things about the car, also. Like, did you know how many inches the pistons are? I do! I also know the correct oil to use for it, how to treat the leather interior, and how to load it onto a flatbed truck in case of a flat tire."
"RORY: Geez, did he talk about anything else but the car?"
"LORELAI: Not until we got to the restaurant . . .and the wine list."
"RORY: Oh no, he's a wine-y?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he sniffed, swirled, swished, and did every other pretentious and borderline-disgusting thing that you can do with a glass of wine in a public place, and he did it all while describing to me the vintage discrepancies and the wood they use for the barrels in Palermo and the grape crop projections for the following year. And I, in turn, chimed in with my story about getting sick on Andre Cold Duck in the back of Peter Cutler's car in ninth grade. He didn't find that quite as charming."
"RORY: I can't believe that. That is one of your best anecdotes."
"LORELAI: I know! So I stopped talking. He continued talking and I just sat there thinking about Peter Cutler. How was Peter Cutler? Where was Peter Cutler? Was there any chance that Peter Cutler would appear and k*ll the man sitting across from me talking about torque?"
"RORY: Was the food good at least?"
"LORELAI: Tiny portions, weird sauces."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: That's okay. You don't know until you try, right? Anyhow, I am going to go to bed now and dream of Peter Cutler. Hopefully, it will be dirty."
"RORY: What about Bowie?"
"LORELAI: Unh uh! I'm not sharing Peter Cutler with Bowie."
"RORY: Are you still going?"
"LORELAI: No. There's no way I could stand this guy for another night. I'll catch Bowie the next time he does a farewell tour."
"RORY: Bummer."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: Night Mom."
"LORELAI: Night babe. Oh, and hey, tomorrow, I'll fill you in on how many hours you have to clock to get your pilot's license."
"RORY: I cannot wait."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai and Michel are at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Well, the quilting convention is sitting down to tea."
"MICHEL: Uh, I'm doing internal cartwheels."
"LORELAI: Any messages?"
"MICHEL: Your mother called. The auction people dropped the lamp that we bought at her place and dropped hers off here and she's desperate to have it for some soiree at her house this evening."
"LORELAI: Oh, swell. Well, I guess I can take it to her when I do my other errands. I can pick up Rory, too. [picks up a bowl] This is cool."
"MICHEL: Yes, it was a personal purchase."
"LORELAI: I want it, what is it?"
"MICHEL: An eighteenth century bleeding bowl."
"LORELAI: A bleeding bowl?"
"MICHEL: When doctors bled patients, the blood had to go somewhere, no?"
"LORELAI: Okay  return lamp, pick up Rory, boil right hand."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings, Emily answers. Lorelai is holding a lamp]"
"LORELAI: Hey Mom, I think this is yours."
"EMILY: Ah! Yes, it is. And I believe this is yours."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"EMILY: That auction house is usually so good with deliveries. I'm surprised at the mix up."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, Gilmore and Gilmore  there's kind of a connection there."
"EMILY: Yes, I suppose there is."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I have to pick up Rory in a little while, so we'll see you Friday."
"EMILY: Would you like to sit down, maybe have some coffee?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't wanna leave her standing there."
"EMILY: Well, Rory doesn't get out for another half an hour. You've got a little time."
"LORELAI: Okay, I guess I can stay a minute."
"EMILY: Wonderful. I'll get you a stopwatch so you can keep exact time."
"LORELAI: Uh, that won't be necessary, Mom."
"[they walk to the living room and sit down]"
"EMILY: So, how is everything?"
"LORELAI: Everything's fine."
"EMILY: And how's everything with Rory?"
"LORELAI: Everything with Rory's fine."
"EMILY: And how's everything at the inn?"
"LORELAI: Everything at the inn is fine."
"EMILY: And how was your date?"
"LORELAI: My what?"
"EMILY: Your date with Peyton."
"LORELAI: Well, my date was, shockingly enough, fine. How did you know about his date?"
"EMILY: His mother told me."
"LORELAI: You know his mother?"
"EMILY: A little."
"LORELAI: Oh good."
"EMILY: So, tell me, what did you do?"
"LORELAI: When?"
"EMILY: On your date."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, we just went to dinner, that's all."
"EMILY: I heard you went driving around afterward."
"LORELAI: Well, sure, uh, you know, we drove in the direction of my house. I guess you could call that driving around."
"EMILY: I heard Peyton had a lovely time."
"LORELAI: Did he? Well, that's nice, I'm glad. I should really get going, Mom."
"EMILY: Oh, you have a little more time. I wanna hear more about your date."
"LORELAI: Well, it was just a date, you know, nothing special. Two people eating and talking  one person talking slightly more than the other."
"EMILY: Had he called you since?"
"LORELAI: No, but "
"EMILY: Oh, well, it was only last night, there's time. I just think this is so exciting."
"LORELAI: You know what, Mom, I wouldn't get too excited if I were you."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Well, because we didn't really hit it off that well."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: No one's fault, he's just not really my type."
"EMILY: What do you mean he's not your type?"
"LORELAI: Well, we just don't have any of the same interests, and we didn't find a whole lot to talk about. You know, basically the date was kind of a dud."
"EMILY: Oh, well, that's too bad."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"EMILY: Well, you'll just have to try a little harder on the next date."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: Aren't you going to a concert together next week?"
"LORELAI: Ah, that Peyton's a real Mama's boy, isn't he?"
"EMILY: Just because he shares his life with his mother doesn't make him a Mama's boy, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna go to the concert with him, Mom."
"EMILY: But I thought you had a plan."
"LORELAI: We did, but that was before we spent any time together and realized we can't spend any time together."
"EMILY: You're not gonna cancel on him."
"LORELAI: Mom, believe me, he won't be surprised. He didn't have that great a time either."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you have to go to the concert. You made a commitment to someone, you have to honor it."
"LORELAI: Mom, this is my business, okay?"
"EMILY: Ugh, this is so like you."
"LORELAI: What is so like me?"
"EMILY: You spend five seconds with a person and if they say one wrong thing, you turn on them and never give them a second chance."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: You are extremely judgmental, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm not extremely judgmental of the pot calling the kettle black. I spent two and a half hours with a man who talked about nothing but himself, his place, his car. . ."
"EMILY: He's proud of his accomplishments. What's wrong with that?"
"LORELAI: He didn't end world hunger, Mom. He simply made the grueling decision to spring for the bigger tires."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, you know what, I have to go."
"EMILY: We're not finished discussing this."
"LORELAI: There's nothing to discuss. Rory's waiting. I'll see you Friday."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, I got you a present."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: In my purse."
"[Rory reaches into Lorelai's purse and pulls out a videotape]"
"RORY: Cardio Salsa."
"LORELAI: Yeah, they play the Miami Sound Machine and you dance around, you get a really great workout."
"RORY: Why would you buy me this?"
"LORELAI: Because I'll feel stupid doing in alone."
"RORY: Too bad."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: No way."
"LORELAI: Salsa with me. Pretend I'm Antonio Banderas."
"RORY: If you were standing in back of Antonio Banderas, I couldn't pretend that you were Antonio Banderas."
"LORELAI: Don't you want your mother to live a long and healthy life?"
"RORY: Not if I have to do Cardio Salsa."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Nice knowing you, senora. Adios."
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: I would salsa for you."
"RORY: Well, luckily, you'll never have to."
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello. . .oh, Dwight, hi, it's nice to hear from you, too. . .yeah, hey, how did you get my cell phone number? . . . oh, yeah, gotta love that Babette, huh? . . . oh, the lawn's fine. . .okay. . .okay. . .sure, Dwight, you have a safe trip. . .yeah, bye. [hangs up] It seems that Dwight has been checking the weather reports and Stars Hollow is going to be extra sunny for the next few days, so he was wondering if instead of watering the lawn twice a day for fifteen minutes, we could water it three times a day for ten minutes."
"RORY: He should really get a dog."
"LORELAI: Only if that dog doesn't mind using the bathroom at the gas station cause that lawn is definitely off limits."
"RORY: True."
"LORELAI: So, I have to get back to the inn. . .could you, um, water for me?"
"RORY: It was your idea to do it."
"LORELAI: I can't, I have a China shipment coming in."
"RORY: Do it tonight."
"LORELAI: Dwight says it needs it now, and if we let that lawn die, he's gonna vibe us for the rest of our lives."
"RORY: Not me, I'm going off to college next year."
"LORELAI: You'll be home for holidays."
"RORY: Maybe not now."
"LORELAI: You would stay away from me on holidays just because of Dwight?"
"RORY: Hey, nobody wants vibing on the holidays."
"LORELAI: Rory, please? I'm gonna be seriously late if I have to go all the way home."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Thank you. You're my favorite daughter."
"RORY: You say that to all your daughters."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do, but I only mean it with you."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Rory leaves; Lorelai's cell phone rings again]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Dwight, please, you are on a business trip  get a hooker. [answers phone] Hello?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, good, I'm glad I got you. I just wanted you to know that I am playing golf with Peyton's father Brennan on Sunday."
"LORELAI: Okay. [pause] Wear sunscreen."
"RICHARD: I will call you afterward and we can evaluate how to proceed from there."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RICHARD: Well, I'm not sure how much damage has been done so I need some time with the man to assess whether or not a simple apology will work."
"LORELAI: Apology from who?"
"RICHARD: From you."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RICHARD: For the way you treated Peyton."
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"RICHARD: Of course I'm serious."
"LORELAI: Dad, this is none of your business."
"RICHARD: It certainly is my business."
"[Lorelai walks outside]"
"LORELAI: No, who I date or do not date is absolutely none of your business."
"RICHARD: Peyton's mother is in the DAR with your mother."
"LORELAI: I know that."
"RICHARD: She's also on the Opera Committee with your mother, the hospital board with your mother, the horticultural society with your mother."
"LORELAI: I get it, they hang, what's the point?"
"RICHARD: This woman is a very important person in our social circle. She may have taken what you did the wrong way, which could affect her relationship with your mother."
"LORELAI: Dad, all I did was not go on a second date with her fully grown son. There's no way she's gonna be mad at Mom for that."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, you obviously do not understand the way things work in your mother's world. There is a certain protocol that must be followed, social rules that dictate proper behavior, and these rules must be very strictly adhered to."
"LORELAI: Dad, I'm not going out with Peyton again, period."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, let me tell you a little story. Now, two years ago, Sally Wallington's check for the winter formal bounced."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RICHARD: It took her two weeks to replace the check."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RICHARD: When Sally attended the next DAR meeting, she was served the last cup of tea."
"LORELAI: Soooo?"
"RICHARD: Before this unfortunate incident, Sally Wallington always received the first cup of tea. When she was suddenly demoted, your mother moved up to the prime tea spot, and she's held that spot ever since. Now, she's very proud of that spot, and now she's afraid that this little incident may jeopardize it."
"LORELAI: Dad, I explained this to Mom and I'll explain it to you. I'm not sixteen, I don't live with you anymore, I've been making my own decisions, romantic and otherwise, for a long time now and you can play all the golf you want but the subject better be letting chicks into the Augusta Golf Club because my love life is officially off limits."
"RICHARD: Didn't you hear what I just said?"
"LORELAI: About the tea? Yes, I heard it, and I'm sorry, but it sounds insane."
"RICHARD: Of course it sounds insane! It is insane, that is not the point."
"LORELAI: Okay, then what's the point?"
"RICHARD: The point is your mother is upset, and I don't want her to be upset. Now, you may not understand her world, I may not understand her world, but it is her world, and in her world it is very, very important that she have the first cup of tea. And I don't care about your independence or what you told your mother or anything else you have to say  if my wife wants the first cup of tea, she's going to have the first cup of tea, that's it! Now, I will call you after I play golf. [hangs up]"
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Rory turns on the sprinklers, then walks into the house. The phone rings]"
"DWIGHT: [on answering machine] Hey, it's Dwight, leave a message, I'm listening."
"WOMAN: [on answering machine] Dwight, hi it's Doris. Doris, your wife, remember me? The woman who was asleep in bed when you snuck out the window like a spineless little worm! How dare you sneak out like that, you sniveling little pond scum sample! I should call Erin Brockovich to bring a lawsuit against your parents, you steaming lump of toxic waste! You really thought you could get away from me? From me? I would've found you sooner if I had bothered to look, but now I have, I found you, and all I can say is this  I want my board games back! I want them back and I want them back now! And I will hunt you down to the ends of the Earth until I get them back  especially the Trivial Pursuit!"
"[Rory walks outside and tries to turn the sprinklers off, but instead turns them up higher]"
"RORY: Whoa! Agh! [she tries to turn them off] Whoa, gross! [she gives up and pulls out her text pager] Dean, please have your pager with you, please, come on. Dean, come on! Damn you and your b*mb tendencies! Aw man! [runs away from the house]"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory, soaked from the sprinklers, runs down the street and bumps into Jess]"
"JESS: Whoa, whoa, slow down."
"RORY: Get out of my way."
"JESS: I like the new look. It's very Blue Crush."
"RORY: Hilarious."
"JESS: What's the matter?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"JESS: You're walking pretty fast for nothing."
"RORY: Well, our president said exercise and I am very patriotic."
"JESS: And completely soaked."
"RORY: Where is everyone?"
"JESS: Who are you looking for?"
"RORY: No one."
"JESS: Rory, stop. What's the matter  other than the fact that you're obviously out of towels."
"RORY: This guy moved in across the way from us and we said we'd water his lawn and the grass can only be watered in ten minute increments, otherwise the lawn drowns, and the thing is stuck and it won't turn off and I have to find someone, Luke or Taylor or . . .[Jess starts walking away] Where are you going? Jess!"
"CUT TO DWIGHT'S FRONT YARD"
"[Rory follows Jess up the pathway to the spigot]"
"RORY: You don't have to do this. I didn't ask you to do this. I can just find someone else to do it. [Jess turns off the sprinkler] Aw, you made it look so easy."
"JESS: Yeah, it was loose. You just had to press down and give it a good twist, that's all."
"RORY: Well, thank you."
"JESS: You're welcome. So things are good?"
"RORY: Oh, yeah, really good."
"JESS: School?"
"RORY: Good."
"JESS: Still gonna do the Harvard thing?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Good."
"RORY: Yeah, good. So. . .[pager goes off] My pager."
"JESS: Yeah, I figured."
"[Rory checks the pager, then puts it away]"
"JESS: Who is it?"
"RORY: It's, uh, Dean. I paged him earlier to come over and help me and he just got the message, so he's. . ."
"JESS: Coming over to help."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Okay."
"[Jess turns the sprinkler back on and walks away]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings, Emily answers the door]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"EMILY: Hello Lorelai."
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: Hello Rory. That's a pretty sweater."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[they start walking to the living room]"
"EMILY: I do love you in blue, you should wear blue more often. Buy her more blue, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'll get right on it. So, I brought you something Mom."
"EMILY: Oh really? Soda, Rory?"
"RORY: Yes, please."
"LORELAI: Um, these are some pictures from Sookie's wedding. There's a great one of you and Dad dancing. I put them in an album for you."
"EMILY: Well, that's very nice, thank you."
"LORELAI: You wanna see?"
"EMILY: I'm making drinks right now, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Right, later it is."
"EMILY: [hands Rory a glass] Here you go. [hands Lorelai a glass] Here."
"LORELAI: Oh, guess I'm having wine."
"EMILY: You didn't want wine?"
"LORELAI: Wine's fine."
"EMILY: Give it back, I'll get you something else."
"LORELAI: No, I'm good with wine, Mom."
"EMILY: I can make you a martini, would you like a martini?"
"LORELAI: No, I just  you usually ask me what I want, and tonight you didn't ask me what I wanted so I didn't have a chance to tell you how much I would love some wine."
"EMILY: I bought some cheese to have before dinner."
"RORY: Great, we love cheese."
"LORELAI: It goes great with wine."
"EMILY: I will be right back. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Boy, it's cold in here."
"RORY: It's a lot colder where you're sitting."
"LORELAI: Ugh. She's mad at me."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: Think she's gonna be mad at me all night?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: I guess I should go in there and talk to her."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: You wouldn't wanna go in there and talk to her for me?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Good thing you don't get paid by the word."
"RORY: The sooner you get in there, the sooner you get cheese."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"CUT TO KITCHEN"
"[Emily is preparing a plate of cheese as Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Need some help?"
"EMILY: No, I'm fine, thank you."
"LORELAI: Mom, I just wanted to say I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Sorry for what?"
"LORELAI: Sorry about the whole Peyton thing. When I asked you for his number, I didn't think. . ."
"EMILY: Think about what?"
"LORELAI: Think about what would happen if things didn't work out with us. I mean, I know his mom is your friend, and I shouldn't have even gotten mixed up in this whole thing if I wasn't prepared to remember that what I do will affect you, and to me it's just a Bowie concert, but to you, it's not. I was a little thoughtless and I'm sorry, but you have to understand that I was not lying when I said we had a bad time. We had a really, really, really, really, really bad time. I swear, it was one of the worst times I've ever had, it was awful. Do you remember skiing with the Danners and their Dobermans?"
"EMILY: Oh, God, yes."
"LORELAI: This was worse. And, by the way, not just for me  it was pretty bad for him, too. It wasn't like he was in love and I was miserable. We were both in pain  deep pain, Marathon Man kind of pain. But despite all of this horrible pain that we were both in, and would be in again if we had to spend one more second together, if you really want me to, I will go to the Bowie concert with him."
"EMILY: Well, your saying that means a lot."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai. Borrow Rory's sweater when you go. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: [sings] Ground control to Major Tom. . ."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[A bunch of catalogs are spread on the kitchen table, and Lorelai is going through them as Rory walks out of her bedroom]"
"RORY: Morning."
"LORELAI: Morning."
"RORY: Wow, someone woke up in project mode today."
"LORELAI: I'm like the army, baby. I get more done before nine o'clock in the morning than others get done all day."
"RORY: Well, as long as you don't abandon it mid-project."
"LORELAI: I do not do that."
"RORY: Make your own seashell candles."
"LORELAI: Aw, not fair."
"RORY: The place smelled like melted crayons for three weeks."
"LORELAI: This is different."
"RORY: Fine, what's the project?"
"LORELAI: This is a pile of every catalog we have received for the last three months."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: I have gathered them all together, and I will now proceed to call all the companies that are sending us duplicates and tell them to stop."
"RORY: That's very environmental of you."
"LORELAI: It's getting ridiculous. We get, like, eight of some of these."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: Check this out. [picks up a stack of catalogs] This is a stack of identical catalogs mailed to Lorelai Gilmore, Rory Gilmore, Lorelai Rory Gilmore, Lorelai V. Gilmore, Lorelai Victoria Gilmore, Lorelai Gilmo, Lorelai Gil, and Squeegy Beckinheim."
"RORY: How'd that get in there?"
"LORELAI: I once told a store my name was Squeegy Beckinheim just to see how many catalogs they would sell my name to, and apparently my name is to catalog companies what Brooke Shields' picture is to Chinese restaurants."
"RORY: How many?"
"LORELAI: Ten."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Including one we were already getting seven catalogs from."
"RORY: So apparently you made the problem worse."
"LORELAI: Unintentionally."
"[Rory reads the label on another catalog]"
"RORY: This one is addressed to Tookie Clothespin."
"LORELAI: Oh, I forgot my code name at the second store I tested, so I told them it was Tookie Clothespin."
"RORY: Which means we get even more catalogs."
"LORELAI: Again, it was unintentional."
"RORY: When you start a forest fire unintentionally, it's still your fault."
"LORELAI: You're putting calling myself Squeegy Beckinheim and Tookie Clothespin on a level with starting a forest fire?"
"RORY: It's k*ll trees."
"LORELAI: You're depressing me now."
"RORY: Well, get on the phone and stop the madness. That'll cheer you up."
"LORELAI: I need coffee."
"RORY: There's more coffee."
"LORELAI: I should get ready, too."
"RORY: You're stopping mid-project."
"LORELAI: I'm bored."
"RORY: Then don't start these projects."
"LORELAI: I promise I'll finish. I just wanna check on the seashells."
"RORY: These catalogs will be sitting here forever."
"LORELAI: No, they won't. They're biodegradable."
"RORY: Come on, I'll call half, you call half, okay?"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: You do yours first, then I'll do mine."
"RORY: Hey!"
"LORELAI: We only have one phone. You're young. You'll dial faster. [leaves room]"
"RORY: Squeegy!"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO"
"[There's a town meeting going on]"
"TAYLOR: The bottom line is that too many birds are landing atop the street lights and relieving themselves on helpless passersby. And I dare say that some of these birds seem to be doing it on purpose."
"BABETTE: You get dumped on, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: It's not just me. . ."
"LUKE: Hey, if anybody has a picture of Taylor getting dumped on, I'll pay top dollar."
"KIRK: I'll check the internet."
"MISS PATTY: Taylor, all animals have to. . .you know. How are you gonna stop birds from doing that?"
"TAYLOR: Easy. Put sharp metal spikes on the top of the fixtures, then when they land, pow  they're shish-kabobs."
"RORY: That's cruel."
"BABETTE: You can't do that."
"ANDREW: I'd rather have bird crap fall on my head."
"LORELAI: There it is  our new town slogan."
"RORY: I like it."
"LORELAI: I see coffee mugs, T-shirts."
"RORY: Don't forget stuffed shish-kabobbed birds."
"LORELAI: That moan when you squeeze them."
"[a man enters through the large sliding door]"
"JESUS: Excuse me."
"TAYLOR: May I help you, sir?"
"JESUS: Yes, I was looking for. . .ah, there she is. . .uh, Patricia."
"LORELAI: Patricia. . .well, well, well."
"EVERYONE: Woooooooo!"
"MISS PATTY: Now stop it."
"JESUS: Are you ready?"
"MISS PATTY: I'm right in the middle of something, Jesus, but I'll be right out. Patience."
"JESUS: Okay. [walks out]"
"TAYLOR: Now, as we were saying. . ."
"BABETTE: Who's the fox, Patty?"
"TAYLOR: Excuse me."
"MISS PATTY: I met him at a funeral. Great guy, good dancer, Latin. . ."
"EVERYONE: Wooooooo!"
"TAYLOR: People, order please."
"LORELAI: He better treat you right, this guy."
"BABETTE: Yeah, how well do you know him?"
"MISS PATTY: Well, I just met him."
"KIRK: I could look him up on the internet."
"TAYLOR: People, please! Now, due to the lack of response, we'll hold off on the bird spikes."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: Let Miss Patty's date begin."
"[Babette hands Patty a camera]"
"BABETTE: It's a digital. I want a full visual account."
"TAYLOR: Hold it. There's one more issue that must be addressed before we can adjourn. All right. Now, that weird, taciturn fellow who's always walking around with his backpack has put in an absurd request to stage a protest in the town square."
"LORELAI: The town loner?"
"LUKE: That guy still lives around here?"
"BABETTE: Somewhere in the hills, right?"
"LUKE: I thought he was long gone."
"ANDREW: No, he came into the bookstore a couple times last month, never said a word."
"MISS PATTY: He's a bit creepy."
"TAYLOR: Very creepy."
"LORELAI: But he's our Boo Radley, and we don't have a Boo Radley, unless you count the troubadour or Pete the pizza guy or the guy who talks to mailboxes."
"RORY: Well, I think the point is that every town needs as many Boo Radleys as they can get."
"LORELAI: Yes, that's my point."
"MISS PATTY: What's he protesting, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Well, that's not indicated here, but it doesn't matter, because protesting is not allowed in the town square, period. It's un-American."
"LUKE: You mean like the Revolutionary w*r?"
"BABETTE: And Rosa Parks?"
"TAYLOR: That's different. They were against the British and buses. No one likes the British or buses."
"[Jesus walks in again]"
"MISS PATTY: Yes, dear, what is it?"
"JESUS: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I heard my name."
"MISS PATTY: No, he said buses, dear, not Jesus."
"JESUS: Sounded like Jesus. [leaves]"
"TAYLOR: Could this meeting be more disrupted?"
"LORELAI: I could do a soft shoe."
"RORY: Yeah, while I pound out a b*at on the bongos."
"BABETTE: Ooh, that sounds like fun!"
"MISS PATTY: I got bongos in the back."
"TAYLOR: Seeing as how our attention spans are gnat-like tonight, as town Selectman I am refusing the town loner's request to protest and I am adjourning this meeting."
"LORELAI: She's all yours, Jesus!"
"LUKE: We got nothing of substance done in this meeting."
"LORELAI: And the tradition stands."
"[People start to leave; Lorelai, Luke, and Rory walk out together]"
"LORELAI: Hey, what do you know about this town loner guy?"
"LUKE: Same as everyone. Just kind of skulks around with that backpack, never smiles."
"LORELAI: Does he also make cheeseburgers and secretly harbor a desire to wear a backwards baseball cap?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: [sings] They're cousins, identical cousins. . ."
"LUKE: Stop it."
"[Jess drives by in a b*at car]"
"LORELAI: Well. . . look who's back behind the wheel. Lovely."
"RORY: Mom, I'm gonna get going. I've got some studying to do."
"LORELAI: Okay, babe. I'll catch up with you."
"[Rory leaves]"
"LORELAI: When did Jess get a car?"
"LUKE: Oh, uh. . .recently."
"LORELAI: Where'd he get it?"
"LUKE: He got it from a guy around here, at a place."
"LORELAI: A guy at a place?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You had no idea he had a car, did you?"
"LUKE: Not in the least."
"LORELAI: Ah, way to have a handle on things, Luke."
"LUKE: Well, he doesn't share a lot with me, you know? And he's got a license. What can I do?"
"LORELAI: Stop him before he k*ll."
"LUKE: He's not gonna k*ll anyone."
"LORELAI: He's got a bad track record with cars."
"LUKE: Yeah, I know, okay? I'm not exactly thrilled with this."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'm sorry. It's your thing. I'll just butt out now."
"LUKE: Where'd he get the money?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: For the car. Where'd he get it?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Working at the diner?"
"LUKE: I can barely afford a car on the money I get working at the diner."
"LORELAI: Maybe it was a gift from someone. . .who doesn't know it's gone yet."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"LORELAI: I'm helpful, aren't I?"
"LUKE: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Lorelai leaves; Luke walks over to Jess]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"LUKE: So. . .you got a car."
"JESS: Motor Trend's not gonna be giving it any awards, but it'll get me from point A to point B."
"LUKE: Yeah, I guess it'll get you around. So, uh. . .where'd you get the money for it?"
"JESS: Mugged an old lady."
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: It didn't cost that much."
"LUKE: What's not much?"
"JESS: Less than a lot?"
"LUKE: Jess, where did you get the money?"
"JESS: You know that hash you sling at the diner? I scrape it off the plates in the back. Remember I work for you?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I know you do."
"JESS: Okay, then."
"LUKE: I also know I don't pay you enough to buy the car."
"JESS: I saved up my pennies and I bought the car from Gypsy. She gave me a good deal. That's how I got the car."
"LUKE: Okay, so you bought a car. Now, the price of the car is just one small thing. It's just the beginning."
"JESS: Oh, yeah?"
"LUKE: Did you take the additional expenses into account?"
"JESS: Like. . ."
"LUKE: Insurance?"
"JESS: I'm in good hands."
"LUKE: Liability, uninsured motorist?"
"JESS: All the paperwork's in the glove compartment. Feel free to check it out."
"LUKE: Money for gas?"
"JESS: You mean this didn't come with a never empty magical t*nk?"
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: I factored that in."
"LUKE: You're gonna have repairs."
"JESS: Yeah, and I can fix most of them myself and save up for the rest. Plus, I'm gonna make sure to replace the oil every couple months."
"LUKE: Right, I bet you didn't think of that, the oil. That costs money."
"JESS: I'm the one that brought it up. You're the one that didn't think of it."
"LUKE: No, but. . .I just. . ."
"JESS: Sign this. [hands him a piece of paper]"
"LUKE: The registration?"
"JESS: I'm still a minor."
"LUKE: I don't have a pen."
"[Jess hands him a pen]"
"LUKE: I guess it's okay that someone else's name is crossed out on it and that yours it written in."
"JESS: Yup."
"LUKE: Just checking. [signs it and hands it back]"
"JESS: Thanks. I'm glad we had this talk."
"LUKE: Yeah, same here."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is studying on the couch as Lorelai walks through the front door with the mail]"
"LORELAI: Hello!"
"RORY: I'm in here!"
"LORELAI: Wow, you b*at me home by two minutes and your nose is already in the books."
"RORY: I can go from zero to studying in less than sixty seconds."
"LORELAI: Very impressive. Mail call. [hands Rory a piece of mail]"
"RORY: What's this?"
"LORELAI: Mortgage payment. You mind picking it up this month sweetie, baby, cookie, honey?"
"RORY: No, not at all."
"LORELAI: It's just something addressed to you."
"[Rory opens it]"
"RORY: It's an invitation."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"RORY: [reads it] Oh."
"LORELAI: An invitation to what? Oh, is it the White House again? Those boys never give up."
"RORY: It's to Sherry's baby shower."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: Sherry. Sherry Tinsdale. Dad's Sherry?"
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"RORY: It's at her and Dad's house on Sunday."
"LORELAI: Wow, that is very weird. We haven't had contact with Christopher in months. She must know we're on the outs with him, right?"
"RORY: Yeah, but she may not know how on the outs."
"LORELAI: Well, zero contact is maximum on the outs."
"RORY: Yeah. . .although there may have been some."
"LORELAI: Some what?"
"RORY: Some contact."
"LORELAI: Oh. . .you've been in contact with Christopher?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: On, no, hon, don't apologize. You've always been totally free to talk to him whenever you want. I've told you that. I mean, he's your dad, right? So don't apologize."
"RORY: Okay, I take the apology back."
"LORELAI: I think it's good you've been talking to him. It is a little weird you didn't tell me, though."
"RORY: Yeah, sorry."
"LORELAI: Will you stop apologizing?"
"RORY: Even when I feel like I should apologize, I can't apologize?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's a little annoying."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I'm just trying to lighten the mood here."
"LORELAI: The mood is light. I just hate that you thought you had to hide something like that from me."
"RORY: I just kind of felt like I was betraying you or something."
"LORELAI: Well, you weren't."
"RORY: I know that now."
"LORELAI: So, how much contact have you had with him?"
"RORY: Not tons. He emailed me a month or so ago, I emailed him back, and now we occasionally talk on the phone."
"LORELAI: Does he ever ask about me?"
"RORY: What answer will freak you out the least?"
"LORELAI: The honest one."
"RORY: Yes, he asks about you because Dad will always care for you very much, you know that. Do you want me to say hello for you next time we talk?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Fine. [holds up invitation] What should I do about this?"
"LORELAI: It's your call."
"RORY: I guess being in Dad's world automatically means being in Sherry's."
"LORELAI: And it is your little half brother or sister she's carrying."
"RORY: I know, it's weird."
"LORELAI: Sort of a good reason to make some connection with her."
"RORY: Yeah, but it's gonna be one of those brunchy quichey things where I don't know anyone, and it's all the way in Boston."
"LORELAI: I'll drive you there if you want."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'll do some Boston shopping while you quiche it."
"RORY: And we can set up some sort of SOS signal that I can page you with if I want to bail early?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"RORY: What should the SOS signal be?"
"LORELAI: How about. . .SOS?"
"RORY: Perfect."
"LORELAI: So you're going."
"RORY: I guess I'm going."
"LORELAI: Good, I think you've made the right decision."
"RORY: So do I. And I shouldn't have hid that I'm talking to Dad. I'm really s"
"LORELAI: Ah!"
"RORY: Starving."
"LORELAI: I'll get some ice cream."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is behind the counter as Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"LUKE: You're up early."
"JESS: I got a few errands to run."
"LUKE: You got time before school?"
"JESS: I got wheels."
"LUKE: Right, right, you got wheels. [Jess takes a donut from the display] Lid."
"JESS: By the way, I owe you ten bucks."
"LUKE: When did I loan you ten bucks?"
"JESS: Last night."
"LUKE: I wasn't here last night."
"JESS: You're always here, Uncle Luke  in my heart."
"LUKE: You took money out of the register"
"JESS: I'm going to the bank now. You'll get it back today."
"LUKE: I told you a hundred times, do not take money out of the register."
"JESS: Gotta run."
"LUKE: Lid."
"[Jess leaves, and Luke watches him out the window. Kirk, sitting at a table, clears his throat]"
"LUKE: Oh, uh, what can I get you, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Patty melt and a coke."
"LUKE: You want the melt cut into squares or stars today?"
"KIRK: Half and half?"
"LUKE: Okay, coming right up."
"KIRK: Thanks. [looks out the window at Jess' car] Man, that car's a honey. Duel piston cams, diplex overdrive with maximum torque, sixteen liter side by side, firing three on one. . . sweet."
"LUKE: Kirk, none of that makes any sense."
"KIRK: What?"
"LUKE: I know a little about cars, that was all gibberish."
"KIRK: Oh, well, would you mind not telling people about this? I've cultivated a reputation as sort of a car aficionado and in reality, all I have is a Jan and Dean record."
"LUKE: I'll keep it to myself."
"KIRK: I should probably listen to it again."
"LUKE: Yeah, I would."
"KIRK: Man, I wish my mom would let me have a car. . .or a bike. . .or my roller skates back."

"CUT TO HEWES BROTHERS' GARAGE"
"[Gypsy is looking under Jackson's truck]"
"GYPSY: You don't take care of it."
"JACKSON: I take great care of it."
"GYPSY: This truck doesn't like you."
"JACKSON: Oh, is it talking to you now?"
"GYPSY: Your transmission's sh*t."
"JACKSON: I shift up and down a lot."
"GYPSY: Mr. Grind-it-til-you-find-it, huh?"
"JACKSON: Just tell me what needs doing."
"GYPSY: Be faster to say what doesn't need doing."
"JACKSON: Whatever you want."
"GYPSY: You ride your breaks. Bad for the truck, good for me. I like replacing brakes. Pays for the cable TV."
"JACKSON: No problem. How bout I just make the check out directly to your cable company, would that be easier for you?"
"GYPSY: Yeah, thanks. And get some extra checks cause you're gonna be making one out to my milkman, too. Oh, and looky here, you just bought me a couch. [Luke walks up to them] Hey Luke."
"LUKE: Hey Gypsy. I don't wanna interrupt."
"JACKSON: No, please, interrupt. I need a little break from the gaiety. [walks away]"
"GYPSY: What can I do for you?"
"LUKE: Uh, well, uh, Jess came home with this car and it says on the slip that he bought it from you."
"GYPSY: Yup, it's working great, if that's what you're wondering."
"LUKE: No, I know that, it's just, uh. . . he paid you for it, right?"
"GYPSY: Nothing's free at Gypsy's."
"LUKE: And he paid cash?"
"GYPSY: Mostly twenties."
"LUKE: Did you make sure Andrew Jackson was on the bills, not Alfred E. Newman or someone?"
"GYPSY: Looked real to me."
"LUKE: Well, when he took the money out of wherever he had it, did a mask or a g*n fall out?"
"GYPSY: No, but he was carrying it in a canvas bag with a big dollar sign on it."
"LUKE: Really?"
"GYPSY: No."
"LUKE: Good."
"GYPSY: Guys are stupid."
"LUKE: What?"
"GYPSY: You strip your gears, you ride your breaks, and if we don't laugh after we make a joke, you think we're serious."
"JACKSON: I don't ride my brakes!"
"LUKE: I just want to make sure it was on the up and up."
"GYPSY: Hey, when people come in with cash, I don't ask where it comes from, do you?"
"LUKE: Nah, I guess I don't. Thanks."
"GYPSY: Anytime."
"[Luke leaves; Gypsy looks under the hood of Jackson's truck]"
"GYPSY: Oh, goody, a trip to Florida!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Taylor, a priest, and a rabbi are sitting at a table in mid-conversation]"
"TAYLOR: This is outrageous. The town unanimously refused to let that loner freak protest in the square. Why would the two of you consider allowing him to do it from the steps of your church?"
"REVEREND: The town didn't refuse him, Taylor  you did."
"TAYLOR: So you're spearheading this revolt, Reverend?"
"RABBI: Reverend Skinner and I share the church for services, Taylor, so if there's gonna be a protest, it'll be a joint decision. Ugh, I can't even look at this mayonnaise."
"REVEREND: I got it, David. [moves the mayonnaise bottle]"
"RABBI: Thanks, Archie."
"TAYLOR: I could still ban it. I could get the town council together, find something on the books. I'm sure there's a way."
"REVEREND: The church is exempt from your town statutes, Taylor."
"RABBI: We answer to a higher authority. . . like the hot dog."
"REVEREND: I laugh every time you say that."
"RABBI: I know. Funny is funny."
"TAYLOR: Well, I can guarantee that God does not want this either."
"REVEREND: Did you hear that, David? Taylor Doose is in direct communication with God."
"RABBI: Thirty years I'm working for God, I haven't received so much as a card."
"REVEREND: Is it by phone that you speak with him, Taylor?"
"RABBI: Do you have a God phone, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Rabbi, please."
"REVEREND: What's he like? For us common folk who've never met him?"
"RABBI: Is he short, is he tall?"
"REVEREND: Does he like to laugh?"
"RABBI: Is the whole shellfish thing really serious? Because, I gotta tell you, some of these Red Lobster commercials. . ."
"REVEREND: They look good, huh?"
"RABBI: Oh, with the melted butter? Oh my God."
"TAYLOR: Can we stay serious for a minute here?"
"REVEREND: You're too uptight, Taylor."
"RABBI: And no matter how much steam blows out of your ears, our decision will be final."
"TAYLOR: So it's hardball, huh? Well, the council gave you special permission to run bingo out of that building. We could withdraw it."
"RABBI: At your peril."
"TAYLOR: Meaning?"
"RABBI: You're gonna tell my little old ladies, my bubbies, you're shutting down their bingo?"
"TAYLOR: I'm not afraid of your bubbies, Rabbi."
"REVEREND: Oh, God, thank you for letting me be in the room when Taylor said that."
"TAYLOR: Well, gentlemen, I would sincerely like to thank you for wasting my time."
"REVEREND: Our pleasure, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I can't believe that you, Reverend Skinner, of all people, would do this to me after all the support I've given you over the years."
"REVEREND: All the support? Taylor, you're a Sunday Protestant. You come in, you say Hi God', you sing a song, and you leave."
"TAYLOR: I always leave a dollar!"
"REVEREND: For your singing voice, you should leave two."
"TAYLOR: Well, fine, if you feel like that, maybe I will just stop showing up altogether. Maybe I'll convert to something else and give them my generous weekly donation."
"REVEREND: Do you want him?"
"RABBI: Not after the whole bubbies thing."
"REVEREND: Maybe the Shakers in Woodbury would take him."
"RABBI: Yeah, he's already got the beard. Can you make furniture, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Goodbye gentlemen."
"[Taylor leaves; Luke enters the diner and walks up to Caesar]"
"LUKE: How's it going?"
"CAESAR: Ah, pretty slow."
"LUKE: Hey, is Jess upstairs?"
"CAESAR: I haven't seen him."
"LUKE: Okay, thanks."
"[Luke goes upstairs and walks into his apartment]"
"LUKE: Jess?"
"[Luke starts going through Jess' dresser drawer. The phone rings, startling him]"
"LUKE: [answers phone] Hello? . . . Oh, hey Randy, what's up?. . . Well, someone's gotta take care of it, you know? It's not going to take care of itself. . . .I understand, I get it. What else?. . . Mmhmm. . ."
"[While on the phone, Luke continues looking through Jess' stuff]"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory and Lane are walking down the street]"
"RORY: So do you think I got a good gift?"
"LANE: It's foolproof."
"RORY: It's not very original."
"LANE: A new mother can't have too many baby blankets. Not with the insane amount of stuff constantly oozing out of a baby's every orifice."
"RORY: Ew."
"LANE: I just call it like I see it."
"RORY: Well, call it less graphically."
"LANE: The very concept of childbirth is vaguely disturbing."
"RORY: Yeah. Kids are cool and all, but getting there seems like a big cosmic joke."
"LANE: Definitely thought up by a man."
"RORY: My mom said that when she told me where babies come from."
"LANE: My mom still hasn't told me."
"RORY: Really?"
"LANE: When my cousin got pregnant, she said it's because an angel brushed its wings against her face."
"RORY: I could fill you in on the details sometime if you want."
"LANE: No thanks, I've picked it up off the streets."
"[they pass Jess' car]"
"LANE: That's new."
"RORY: Is it?"
"LANE: I've never seen it before, and I'm very into the minutia around here."
"RORY: That's for sure."
"LANE: Do you know whose it is?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LANE: Whose?"
"RORY: Jess'."
"LANE: Jess? Jess, the guy who wrecked your car? He's got a car now?"
"RORY: Mmhmm, looks that way."
"LANE: That's outrageous! That's a travesty!"
"RORY: It's not that big a deal."
"LANE: Oh, it's a humongous deal."
"RORY: You're taking this very hard."
"LANE: Because we're best friends, Rory. We're linked. I feel what you feel. Except for right now because you don't seem to be feeling anything and I'm incensed."
"RORY: It's just a car. It's nothing to get excited about."
"[Jess walks over]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Hey Lane."
"LANE: Hey back at ya, tough guy."
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: Lane. . ."
"JESS: Something wrong?"
"RORY: No. . ."
"LANE: Yes! You have a car."
"JESS: I know."
"LANE: Don't give me lip!"
"JESS: Lip?"
"RORY: Lane. . ."
"LANE: How'd you get the car, Jess?"
"JESS: I bought it."
"LANE: Really, I thought you might've built it from parts left over from cars you've totaled."
"JESS: What is your problem?"
"LANE: Don't play dumb. You know what you did."
"JESS: I gotta go."
"LANE: Yes, drive on away, we'll just keep walking. That's all Rory's been able to do these past few months  lots of walking. She's got bunions because of you, mister!"
"JESS: Bunions?"
"RORY: I don't have bunions."
"LANE: She's too nice to complain about her foot ailments."
"JESS: Knock if off, Lane."
"RORY: Just get in the car and go, Jess."
"JESS: I didn't start this."
"LANE: Well, you started it when you wrecked Rory's car."
"JESS: Tell your friend to walk it off."
"RORY: You walk it off."
"JESS: I'm trying to drive off."
"RORY: Then go."
"JESS: Geez, how Andy Griffith is this town that people get so excited by a car?"
"RORY: It's not the car, it's who's got the car."
"JESS: Okay, fine, you want it? Take it, I'm sick of this."
"RORY: I don't want this piece of junk."
"JESS: Right. I suppose Dean is already building you another car, something really snazzy."
"RORY: Shut up and go."
"JESS: Gladly."
"RORY: Let's go."
"LANE: Gladly."
"RORY: [to Jess] Oh, and by the way, you left your bra in the back seat."
"CUT TO BOSTON"
"[Lorelai and Rory pull up in front of Sherry's house. There are green balloons out front]"
"LORELAI: This must be the place."
"RORY: I think the balloons confirm it."
"LORELAI: No pink, no blue."
"RORY: All green."
"LORELAI: Aren't baby shower balloons supposed to reflect the sex of the baby? Blue for boys, pink for girls."
"RORY: You would think."
"LORELAI: What's green for, aliens?"
"RORY: I'll ask when I go in."
"LORELAI: We're all set, right? Anytime you want out, just send up a flare."
"RORY: I will."
"LORELAI: Even if I'm half-naked in a changing room, I'll just grab everything and rush out."
"RORY: You making a half-naked entrance would be funny."
"[Sherry comes to the car window]"
"SHERRY: Hi!"
"RORY: Whoa!"
"SHERRY: Oh, I'm sorry, I totally snuck up on you."
"RORY: It's okay, hi."
"SHERRY: Hi, Rory. Lorelai, I'm so excited you came."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm just dropping Rory off."
"SHERRY: Oh, don't go. Stay."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SHERRY: Come to the party, please?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know."
"SHERRY: I know that you weren't invited, but it's just cause my friends didn't think that you'd be comfortable. I told them not to worry."
"LORELAI: Thanks, but I'm not really dressed for a party."
"SHERRY: Oh, please. We're not formal here, you look fine."
"LORELAI: Well. . .um. . ."
"RORY: Um, Mom kind of has plans."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I got a couple credit cards burning a hole in my wallet."
"SHERRY: Oh, go shopping some other time and come play with us. Please? There's just a bunch of people in there that Rory doesn't know, and having you here would make her so much more comfortable."
"RORY: Oh, I don't mind not knowing anyone at the party, really."
"SHERRY: That's nice, honey, but very unconvincing. Lorelai, I meant to extend the invitation to both of you. I just wasn't sure if you'd. . . Well, you know, there's lots of food, and booze for the lucky non-pregnant ones, and cake. . .it'll be fun."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"SHERRY: I'll block your car with my stomach."
"LORELAI: No, don't do that."
"SHERRY: Please, it would mean so much."
"LORELAI: Well. . . um, okay, sure."
"SHERRY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, let's have a party."
"SHERRY: Yay! [jumps up and down]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, watch it, you'll jiggle that thing right out of you."
"SHERRY: A mother's perspective, thanks."
"CUT TO SHERRY'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Sherry walk into the house]"
"SHERRY: Come in, come in."
"LORELAI: Nice place."
"RORY: Very nice."
"SHERRY: Well, it's a work-in-progress. It was so bachelor pad before: rock posters, modular furniture, magazines everywhere. I would pick up a TV Guide and it would be three months old. [leads them to the living room] Well, here's the gang."
"[Six women are gathered in the room, and they greet Lorelai and Rory]"
"SHERRY: You've got Gail, Jody, Maureen, Linda, Susan and Alice."

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Signs and banners are displayed in the town square promoting the upcoming 24-hour dance marathon. Lorelai is in Luke's Diner, staring out the window at the people walking by]"
"LUKE: What about that one?"
"LORELAI: Hm, no."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Too pale."
"LUKE: So what?"
"LORELAI: Pale means sickly."
"LUKE: Or sunscreen."
"LORELAI: Or Mad Cow Disease."
"LUKE: Pale does not mean Mad Cow Disease."
"LORELAI: Have you ever had Mad Cow Disease?"
"LUKE: Twice last week and my coloring was wonderful."
"LORELAI: I need a great dance partner this year. Someone strong, non-clutzy, with lots of stamina. Ooh, how tall is that guy?"
"LUKE: Mrs. Coulter's about 6'2""."
"LORELAI: Oh. Four years in a row, I have come this close to winning. Last year, I swear to God, I had it!"
"LUKE: I know the story."
"LORELAI: It was hour twenty-three."
"LUKE: I know the story."
"LORELAI: I'm dancing with Henry Ho-Ho McAphie the third."
"LUKE: How many people heard me say I know the story?"
"[several customers raise their hands]"
"LORELAI: And Ho-Ho's fading, so I'm trying to buck him up, saying ""Come on, Ho-Ho. Stay with me Ho-Ho,"" and then all of a sudden he starts yelling, ""Stop calling me Ho-Ho, it's making me hungry!"""
"LUKE: Oh, hey, look, there goes Tommy Tune."
"LORELAI: And out of nowhere, Kirk comes dancing by, waving a McDonald's hot apple pie in the air and of course Ho-Ho lunges for the pie and drops my hand and that was it. Kirk wins, I'm out. I'm gonna get that Ho-Ho someday."
"LUKE: I'll help ya."
"LORELAI: I wanna win."
"LUKE: I know you do."
"LORELAI: I need a partner."
"LUKE: You'll get one. Keep looking."
"LORELAI: Mm. [she stares up at him]"
"LUKE: Out there. [turns her head toward the window]"
"LORELAI: But, but, wait "
"LUKE: Pancakes, right? Coming right up."
"[walks to another table as Taylor walks in]"
"TAYLOR: Breathe in deep, folks. Smells like fall."
"LUKE: Get out, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Why?"
"LUKE: Just a code I live by."
"TAYLOR: Oh. . .pffft. . .you. Listen, I'd like to run a little something by you."
"LUKE: I'm busy, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I was just thinking how nice it would be if you could set up a little coffee stand at the marathon."
"LUKE: Coffee stand."
"TAYLOR: Yes. I mean, these people have to try and stay up for twenty-four hours. What better to help you stay up than a cup of nice strong cup of coffee, huh? What do you say?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"TAYLOR: Really?"
"LUKE: For a buck a cup."
"TAYLOR: Luke, this marathon is a charitable event."
"LUKE: Taylor, we have been raising money to restore that stupid bridge for eight years."
"TAYLOR: We're not raising money to restore the bridge."
"LUKE: We're not?"
"TAYLOR: No, we have that money. The Tennessee Williams lookalike contest last month put us right over the top."
"LUKE: Then what the hell is this dumb thing for?"
"TAYLOR: A tarp."
"LUKE: A what?"
"TAYLOR: To cover the bridge."
"LUKE: This is a first, Taylor. I actually need to sit down."
"TAYLOR: Well, Luke, you know as well as I do that if we start renovations now, heading right into the snow and rainy part of the season, then everything we do is gonna get ruined, and there we are  back at square one. If we are gonna do this right, then we are going to need a tarp."
"LUKE: Taylor, you are asking me to donate free coffee to hundreds of people so you can raise money to buy a tarp."
"TAYLOR: How bout fifty cents a cup?"
"LUKE: How bout I charge for cream?"
"TAYLOR: You would kick Tiny Tim's crutch out from under him, wouldn't you?"
"LUKE: If he asks for a free cup of coffee, gimpy's going down."
"[Taylor storms out of the diner as Luke walks over to Lorelai's table]"
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa  look at Taylor go. I wonder who he's dancing with."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating dinner]"
"LORELAI: This is amazing chicken, Mom. I mean it, really great."
"EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: It's like super chicken. I bet it could fly. Have you tried tossing it out the window?"
"EMILY: All right, what's going on?"
"LORELAI: What? I like the chicken."
"EMILY: Nobody likes the chicken that much, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I'm in a good mood."
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: My God, it's my ninth grade homecoming dance all over again."
"RORY: Homecoming dance?"
"LORELAI: In ninth grade, I got asked to the homecoming dance and I didn't think I would, and I was in a really good mood, and Mom got so annoyed that she made me go to my room."
"RORY: Grandma?"
"EMILY: She was sitting at the table giving all the peas voices."
"LORELAI: With a little encouragement, I could've been the Senor Wences of the vegetable set."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay, okay, okay. It'll come out soon enough. Today, ladies and gentlemen, I found a dance partner."
"RORY: You did?"
"LORELAI: A good one."
"EMILY: What are you talking about, a dance partner? A dance partner for what?"
"LORELAI: Our town is having a dance marathon this weekend."
"RORY: It lasts twenty-four hours and the last couple left standing gets a trophy."
"LORELAI: A big trophy."
"EMILY: Well, that sounds very nice."
"RORY: All the proceeds go to charity."
"LORELAI: Which is great  but did I mention the trophy?"
"RORY: I believe you did."
"LORELAI: Cause it's big."
"EMILY: Charitable events are wonderful things to take part in. There's nothing more rewarding than devoting yourself to making someone else's life better."
"LORELAI: And whose life isn't better with a truly gigantic trophy around?"
"RORY: So who'd you get to dance with you?"
"LORELAI: Stanley Appleman."
"RORY: Who's Stanley Appleman?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he's brand new in town. He works over at the hardware store, and the best part is, he used to be part of the touring company. . .of Riverdance."
"RORY: Score!"
"LORELAI: I know! I'm completely jazzed. How bout you, Mr. Potato? I'm completely jazzed, too."
"[a phone rings]"
"EMILY: What's that?"
"LORELAI: I think that's me."
"EMILY: Lorelai, I've told you a hundred times to turn that thing off when you come to dinner here."
"LORELAI: I know, Mom. I'm sorry."
"EMILY: Can't you let it go to voice mail?"
"LORELAI: Well, see, I left Michel alone at the inn, and he's dealing with the roofers. I told him to call me if there was any trouble. [goes to answer the phone]"
"EMILY: Is that true?"
"RORY: I'm gonna let Mr. Potato field this one."
"EMILY: I thought so."
"[Lorelai answers the phone in the next room]"
"LORELAI: Hello? . . . What? . . . Oh, no no, no no, don't tell me that. . .Well, did you tell her how big the trophy is, because I am really not exaggerating here. . . How did your wife get a picture of me? Stanley, that is crazy! I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Did you tell her I don't wanna sleep with you? . . . Well, put her on the phone. I'll tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Well, somebody has to tell her I don't wanna sleep with you. . . Why are you insulted all of a sudden? . . . Stanley? . . ."
"[Lorelai hangs up and walks back to the dining room]"
"LORELAI: Great."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LORELAI: Stanley bailed."
"RORY: No! Why?"
"LORELAI: Apparently, Miss Patty showed his wife a picture of me, and she thinks I look like Elizabeth Taylor, which makes her Debbie Reynolds, and Stanley Eddie Fisher."
"RORY: That's crazy."
"LORELAI: Especially if you've seen Stanley. He's no Eddie Fisher, trust me. Fisher Stevens, maybe."
"RORY: Can't you talk to her?"
"LORELAI: Apparently, only at my own risk."
"EMILY: Well, at least she thought you looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That was nice."
"LORELAI: I have no partner."
"RORY: You'll find another one."
"EMILY: Elizabeth Taylor always did."
"RORY: There's someone else out there, trust me."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"EMILY: Here. Have some more chicken."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Mom."
"EMILY: And if you'd like, later on, you can make my asparagus talk."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe next week."
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory and Paris are standing at Paris' locker. Louise and Madeline are behind them, each kissing a guy]"
"PARIS: Okay, so, let's talk about Saturday."
"RORY: What about Saturday?"
"PARIS: I think we need to work. The seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin comes out next month and I want it to be amazing."
"RORY: I've got some great cover art lined up."
"PARIS: Old pictures, new pictures?"
"RORY: Collage style with kind of a sepia-toned finish to it. Very classy."
"PARIS: Okay, I like it. Time!"
"[Louise and Madeline stop kissing the guys and say goodbye to them]"
"LOUISE: See ya."
"MADELINE: Bye."
"[the four girls start walking down the hall]"
"MADELINE: So, what were we talking about?"
"PARIS: Working Saturday on the seventy-fifth anniversary issue."
"LOUISE: Thanks for asking."
"MADELINE: But you guys already have some decent stuff planned out, right?"
"PARIS: Madeline -- or may I call you Spicoli?"
"MADELINE: If you have to."
"PARIS: This is the seventy-fifth anniversary issue. There is only going to be one seventy-fifth anniversary issue ever, and it's on our watch. We screw this up and we basically mooned a piece of history. Is that what you want? To B.A. history?"
"MADELINE: But I don't understand. Last year was the seventy-fourth anniversary issue of the Franklin."
"PARIS: So?"
"MADELINE: So there's only gonna be one seventy-fourth anniversary issue ever and we didn't do anything special for it."
"LOUISE: I think the cover was of a deep-fried Mars bar."
"PARIS: That's because nobody cares about the seventy-fourth anniversary issue."
"MADELINE: I bet the person who worked on it seventy-four years ago did."
"PARIS: We're working Saturday!"
"[Paris and Rory walk outside]"
"PARIS: ""Why are we working Saturday, Paris? What's so special about the seventy-fifth issue, Paris? Why does my head feel so light and yet not float away, Paris?"""
"[Paris sees Jamie across the courtyard]"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: What's he doing here?"
"RORY: I bet he's here to see you."
"PARIS: He hasn't called me once. I haven't seen or heard from him since we had our date in Washington three months ago."
"RORY: Maybe he wants to explain why."
"PARIS: He was supposed to go away and never come back. I already wrote his name in my revenge notebook."
"RORY: Paris, he knows you're standing here talking about him."
"PARIS: What does he want?"
"RORY: Go over there and find out."
"[Paris walks over to Jamie]"
"PARIS: What do you want?"
"JAMIE: I'm on break from school, I thought I'd come down and see you."
"PARIS: But you never called."
"JAMIE: I know."
"PARIS: You lost my number?"
"JAMIE: Nope, I memorized your number."
"PARIS: You didn't wanna use my number?"
"JAMIE: I was starting classes."
"PARIS: In phone dialing? How's it going?"
"JAMIE: Look, Paris, this year's very important for me. I thought the last thing I needed was a distraction."
"PARIS: Well, I totally understand. This year's very important for me, too. I'm focusing on getting into Harvard, and the last thing that I need is a distraction. . . so, good move. You saved us both a lot of distractions. Thank you, and good luck. [they shake hands, but Jamie doesn't let go] I need my hand."
"JAMIE: If I let go, how fast will you run away?"
"PARIS: 3.2 seconds."
"JAMIE: I thought so. Hey Rory."
"RORY: Hey Jamie. How's Princeton?"
"JAMIE: It's good. Crazy, but "
"PARIS: Let go."
"JAMIE: No."
"PARIS: Yes."
"JAMIE: Paris."
"PARIS: Look, you don't have to be nice, you don't have to tie up loose ends. I get it, I'm a distraction. Now either pull a Boxing Helena, or give me back my hand."
"JAMIE: Yes, talking to you would've been a distraction."
"PARIS: I know. I heard you already. My God, find a pirate to sit on, okay?"
"JAMIE: However, not talking to you has turned out to be impossible."
"PARIS: What?"
"JAMIE: I flunked a pop quiz in poli-sci because I couldn't stop thinking about you. Still want your hand back?"
"PARIS: I've got another."
"JAMIE: I've thought a lot about this, and apparently you're a distraction that I'm supposed to have."
"PARIS: You didn't have a bad time on the date?"
"JAMIE: Are you busy right now?"
"PARIS: Well "
"RORY: No, we're done. She's free."
"JAMIE: Good. Let's go get some coffee. Bye Rory."
"RORY: Bye Jamie."
"[Jamie takes Paris' books from her and walks away]"
"PARIS: He took my books."
"RORY: Well, go get them back."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory, Dean, and Lane are in the living room. Lane is on the phone]"
"RORY: Well?"
"LANE: Still ringing. [a moment later, she hangs up] He's home."
"RORY: How'd he sound?"
"LANE: Homey."
"RORY: Nice."
"DEAN: I know this is a stupid question, but why can't you just talk to him?"
"LANE: Because yesterday he called to say that they were still looking for a rehearsal space and, uh, that he'd call when he had more news. So now I have to wait until he calls about the band  and in between, I call and hang up on him. Pathetic."
"RORY: Not so pathetic. I used to hang up on Dean all the time."
"DEAN: You did?"
"LANE: I remember that."
"DEAN: When did you hang up on me?"
"RORY: Right when we first met."
"DEAN: You should've just said something."
"RORY: I couldn't do that."
"DEAN: Why not?"
"RORY: Because then you would've known that I was calling and therefore that I liked you."
"DEAN: Yes, but I liked you, too."
"RORY: Well, I know that now."
"DEAN: You could've known that then."
"RORY: Dean, please. This is a girl thing."
"DEAN: Uh, okay. Tell me when I'm supposed to pay attention again."
"LANE: I'm gonna love him forever and he's never gonna know it."
"DEAN: He would if you coughed."
"RORY: Dean."
"DEAN: Sorry."
"LANE: At least he's at home and not out with a girl."
"RORY: Very true."
"DEAN: He could be home with a girl."
"RORY: Dean."
"DEAN: Sitting here, staring at my pizza."
"LANE: You think he was at home with a girl?"
"RORY: No, no, I don't."
"LANE: I'm gonna call again."
"RORY: Good idea, and pay attention to the background noise this time."
"[Lorelai walks through the front door]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, cool, pizza."
"RORY: Shh. She's calling Dave to see if she can hear a girl in the background."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"DEAN: I voted that she actually say something."
"LORELAI: You're a boy, you know nothing about this."
"RORY: Well, what'd you hear?"
"LANE: Quadrophenia."
"RORY: Classy, but not date-like."
"LANE: You think?"
"RORY: Definitely."
"DEAN: What if he met a girl who's a major Who fan?"
"LANE: What?"
"RORY: Why are you causing trouble?"
"LORELAI: Rory, can I talk to you in the kitchen?"
"RORY: Oh, sure. [to Dean] Be good."
"[Rory and Lorelai leave the room; Lane sits next to Dean on the couch]"
"DEAN: Go ahead."
"[Lane starts dialing the number again]"
"[cut to Lorelai and Rory in the kitchen]"
"RORY: Okay, so, what's on your mind?"
"LORELAI: I think I figured out who can be my dance partner for the marathon."
"RORY: Great! Who?"
"[Lorelai stares at Rory]"
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Come on!"
"RORY: Forget it."
"LORELAI: Just hear me out. First of all, you love me."
"RORY: Not right at this moment, I don't."
"LORELAI: You know how much this contest means to me. You'd never fall asleep or chase a pie."
"RORY: I do not dance."
"LORELAI: It'll be fun. We'll get all dressed up, and you're light  easy to hold up when you get tired."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Plus, we got the whole mother/daughter gimmick going for us. The crowd'll eat that up."
"RORY: I cannot dance with you."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"RORY: Because this is Dean's first marathon. We were gonna go and watch and hang out, he's totally looking forward to it. I told him about how Andrew gets in a fight with his date in the first fifteen minutes and storms off the floor. I told him about Taylor getting punch-drunk at hour fifteen and telling stories about how he always wanted to be a magician."
"LORELAI: Rory, please."
"RORY: And ooh, I told him about how when Kirk wins, he likes to take his victory lap around the floor to the theme from Rocky. I was gonna show him all those things, and I was gonna show them to him sitting down."
"LORELAI: He can still come, and he can still see all those things, except if you dance, maybe that victory lap will be you and me instead of Kirk."
"RORY: Okay, I'll tell you what. I was supposed to work on the Franklin this weekend with Paris."
"LORELAI: But?"
"RORY: I will ask her if we can reschedule. If she says yes, then I will dance with you."
"LORELAI: Oh, I love ya!"
"RORY: You should sell cars."
"LORELAI: I should, shouldn't I? Hello, big fancy trophy."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"[A teacher is addressing the class as Paris walks in late]"
"TEACHER: Take note of its form before treated. Make sure that your notes are completely legible since you will be turning them in with your result. Miss Gellar, hello."
"PARIS: Sorry I'm late, Mrs. Savitt."
"TEACHER: Is everything okay?"
"PARIS: Yes. I overslept."
"TEACHER: You're kidding."
"PARIS: No, it won't happen again."
"TEACHER: Well, good. Okay, everyone, let's get to work."
"[Rory walks up to Paris]"
"RORY: Paris, hi. Listen, I need to ask you something."
"PARIS: sh**t."
"RORY: Well, there's this big event that's happening in my town. . ."
"PARIS: Pig race?"
"RORY: Dance marathon."
"PARIS: I was close."
"RORY: It's on Saturday, and it's a twenty-four hour thing and my mother really wants to win, and her partner bailed on her and, long story short, I was wondering if there was anyway we could move this Saturday's Franklin thing to next Saturday."
"PARIS: Okay."
"MADELINE: What did she say?"
"LOUISE: I don't know. What did you say?"
"PARIS: I said yes."
"LOUISE: She said yes."
"MADELINE: She said yes."
"LOUISE: [walks up to a guy] Are you free on Saturday?"
"GUY: Uh, no."
"LOUISE: [to another guy] What about you? Come on  speak."
"MADELINE: [from across the room] Louise, I got two over here!"
"PARIS: So, we're done, right?"
"RORY: You had a good time yesterday."
"PARIS: What was yesterday?"
"RORY: Yesterday was the day that you were all freaked out about the seventy-fifth anniversary issue of the Franklin and today's the day you're not."
"PARIS: Rory, just because I agreed to postpone a newspaper session does in no way imply "
"RORY: You can't even stop smiling."
"PARIS: I can, too."
"RORY: Tell me."
"PARIS: Okay. Well, we went for coffee, and he talked about how he had a great time on our date, and how he finds me fascinating, and how he thought about me all the time. Okay, there, happy?"
"RORY: Wow, he likes you."
"PARIS: I left an impression."
"RORY: You sure did."
"PARIS: I still don't understand why he'd wanna date me. He's surrounded by college girls all day long who must be prettier than I am, and more experienced than I am. I mean, I'm sure they're all idiots, but usually that's the last thing a guy thinks about when he's looking for a date for the big game."
"RORY: Well, Jamie must be special."
"PARIS: Or Ted Bundy."
"RORY: Absolutely. It's either one or the other."
"PARIS: Hey. Can you do me a favor?"
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: Don't say anything to Madeline or Louise about this."
"RORY: About Jamie?"
"PARIS: Yeah."
"RORY: But they're your best friends."
"PARIS: Theoretically, yes, but the second I mention a guy they're gonna both start singing the theme from the Trojan Man commercial, and I just can't take that, okay?"
"RORY: No one knows until you give the word."
"PARIS: Thanks."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE STARS HOLLOW"
"[The morning of the dance marathon, Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk toward the high school]"
"LORELAI: I have to say, for a couple of modern girls, we have time-warped with the best of them."
"RORY: Mm."
"LORELAI: How ya doing there, champ?"
"RORY: Early."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's a tad early."
"RORY: No sun."
"LORELAI: Well, he's not up yet."
"RORY: I can't even open my eyes."
"LORELAI: That's okay, there's nothing to see. Kirk's in a Speedo, Taylor's in a skirt, Al's in assless chaps."
"RORY: Oh my God, stop. I'm never gonna be able to close my eyes again."
"[Babette is sitting at the sign-up table in front of Stars Hollow High]"
"LORELAI: Morning Babette."
"BABETTE: Oh, morning sugar. You guys look terrific."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"RORY: Babette, can I lay down on the table while Mom signs in?"
"BABETTE: Not an early bird, huh?"
"LORELAI: I need to get some coffee in her and we'll be fine. Kirk, however, is gonna be crying like a little teeny girl."
"BABETTE: So what else is new? Okay, now you two go get your physicals, bring your release forms inside, and they'll get you a number."
"LORELAI: Thanks. Come on, Snoozy."
"[they start walking down the sidewalk toward Miss Patty's, and Sookie runs up behind them]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, wait up!"
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, look at you!"
"SOOKIE: Is it fabulous?"
"LORELAI: It is fabulous."
"SOOKIE: Wait til you see Jackson's suit. It makes me want to ration sugar."
"LORELAI: Where is Jackson?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, we already had our checkups, so he's going to sign us in and scope out a good spot on the floor."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's so cool to be married. You have your own spot-scoper."
"RORY: I'm gonna go say hi to Lane."
"LORELAI: Okay, hon, hurry back. Remember, the sooner we get inspected, the sooner we get coffee."
"RORY: Yeah, coffee. [walks into Miss Patty's]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, I have a problem."
"LORELAI: Sookie, it's five-thirty in the morning. How can you already have a problem?"
"SOOKIE: Because I'm a multi-tasker."
"LORELAI: Hit me."
"SOOKIE: Last night, I made coq au vin for dinner, so of course the subject of children came up."
"LORELAI: Of course."
"SOOKIE: All of a sudden, completely out of the blue, Jackson announces he wants four in four."
"LORELAI: He wants what?"
"SOOKIE: Four in four. Four kids in four years."
"LORELAI: Good Lord!"
"SOOKIE: I know!"
"LORELAI: Well, who's he gonna have these kids with?"
"SOOKIE: Me, apparently."
"LORELAI: What did you say?"
"SOOKIE: See, here's where, uh, the problem comes in."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I think I said yes."
"LORELAI: How is that possible?"
"SOOKIE: Well, I was totally shocked when he announced it and I sort of said, ""O. . kay"" and . . but I think he took it as, ""Okay!"" So, apparently, now I have to get busy."
"LORELAI: Do you want four in four?"
"SOOKIE: No. But, I mean, I want kids. You know I want kids."
"LORELAI: I know you want kids."
"SOOKIE: But I thought maybe one. Two if the first one is really quiet."
"LORELAI: Well, honey, you have to tell Jackson that."
"SOOKIE: I can't."
"LORELAI: Sookie, this is not like the fruit bowl his mother gave you. You can't stick four kids in the attic and just pull them out at Christmas."
"SOOKIE: I know, but Jackson and I have never had a real fight. We're still newlyweds. We still sneak out of bed in the morning to brush our teeth, then get back in bed and pretend we just woke up smelling like that."
"LORELAI: You don't have much of a marriage if you can't talk about the important things."
"SOOKIE: I know. Do you think I'm crazy to not want four in four?"
"LORELAI: Four kids is a lot, and four years without a cocktail . . ."
"SOOKIE: Wow, hadn't thought of that."
"LORELAI: Glad to shed some much-needed perspective on the situation."
"SOOKIE: We'll take care of this today."
"CUT TO INSIDE MISS PATTY'S"
"[Rory is standing next to Lane, who is stirring a big bucket of something]"
"RORY: Are you sure you don't need some help?"
"LANE: Yeah, it's okay. I finally got a really good footing."
"RORY: What is that stuff?"
"LANE: Eggless egg salad. Though this year my mom added food coloring to make the egg-like product look more eggy."
"RORY: Smart."
"LANE: And every sandwich comes with your own personal pamphlet ""Dancing for the Devil,"" an illustrated look at the effect of dancing on your chances of spending all eternity in hell."
"RORY: Boy, her flames are getting really good."
"LANE: Well, she just bought a new color printer. You can do a ton of stuff with it."
"RORY: Cool."
"[Mrs. Kim walks over carrying several bags]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane, get scooping! The minute air hits the bread, it starts to stale."
"LANE: Okay, Mama."
"RORY: I'm gonna stop by later and say hi."
"LANE: Please do."
"RORY: Bye, Mrs. Kim."
"MRS. KIM: You have a pamphlet?"
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"MRS. KIM: Take one to your mother."
"[Across the studio, Lorelai is next in line for physicals as Rory walks over]"
"NURSE: Next."
"LORELAI: Oh, good, just in time."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Hi there. Um, this is Rory Gilmore and I'm Lorelai Gilmore."
"NURSE: Lorelai Gilmore?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, L  o  r . . ."
"NURSE: You don't look like you've recently suffered a face-altering car crash."
"LORELAI: Uh, excuse me?"
"NURSE: You're also supposed to have buck teeth, a club foot, and alopecia."
"LORELAI: Oh. I'm sorry, who told you this?"
"NURSE: My husband."
"LORELAI: Your husband? Well, who's . . .Stanley Appleman. Your husband is Stanley Appleman."
"NURSE: Mmhmm."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, it's very nice to meet you. Stanley's said the nicest things about you. In the one tiny short conversation we had, you know, standing way far apart. You know, too far to touch, but close enough to hear all the wonderful things he said about his adorable, sweet-tempered, lovable. . . can we have someone else do our physical?"
"CUT TO INSIDE THE STARS HOLLOW HIGH GYMNASIUM"
"[Dancers start to gather on the dance floor as Taylor makes some announcements over a microphone]"
"TAYLOR: Any couple without a number will be disqualified. All couples must be touching at all times. All couples must remain moving at all times. The only time you may stop moving or stop touching is when you hear this horn. [blows air horn] That sound means you have ten minutes. Ten minutes to get a drink, to eat a snack, take a rest, or whatever it is you can do in ten minutes. And in addition to the ten-minute rest periods, every person participating has been issued a yellow emergency card. In case of emergency, a contestant may hold up the card and leave the floor for ten minutes. If your partner remains on the floor and moving the entire time, then the owner of the yellow card may rejoin them and the contest. First aid is available in Miss Patty's. Please, remember, that if you feel yourself getting lightheaded or having sh**ting pains or any other stroke-like symptoms, please move off to the side so that your collapse will not get in the way of the other dancers. All right, people, lace your shoes, pin those curls, because we only have three minutes left until we start."
"LORELAI: Well, I believe three minutes is plenty of time for some coffee."
"RORY: Yes, coffee, please."
"[they walk over to Luke's coffee table on the side of the dance floor]"
"LORELAI: Hey, we're dying, load us up."
"LUKE: It isn't ready yet."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Mommy."
"LORELAI: What do you mean it's not ready? It's six in the morning. Nothing says coffee like six in the morning."
"[Luke picks up a thermos and hands it to them]"
"LUKE: You did not get this from me."
"LORELAI: Then who do we send our kisses of gratitude to?"
"LUKE: The eternal question asked yet again."
"RORY: Thanks Luke. Strong."
"LORELAI: Yeah? Hello."
"TAYLOR: All right, folks. Everybody on the floor. We're two minutes away. I repeat, everybody on the floor, we are two minutes away."
"[On the dance floor, Kirk and his partner walk up to Lorelai and Rory]"
"KIRK: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: Good luck to you."
"LORELAI: And to you."
"[Kirk and his partner walk away]"
"LORELAI: He's going down."
"RORY: I hate to bring this up."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Kirk has very little in his life."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: He has no career, no girlfriend, no pet, no car. He lives with his mother, she won't even let him have his own key. The only thing he does have in his whole lonely pathetic existence is this marathon. If we win, if we take him down, if we take away that last little piece of dignity, then we leave him with nothing."
"LORELAI: I wonder if he'll cry."
"RORY: My mother, the Howard Roark of Stars Hollow."
"TAYLOR: All right, everybody, grab your partners, make sure your numbers are securely fastened, and let the countdown begin!"
"EVERYONE: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!"
"TAYLOR: It's showtime!"
"[All the couples start dancing]"
"[Babette taps Morey on the shoulder]"
"BABETTE: I'm done, let's go."
"MOREY: Okay."

"CUT TO LATER IN THE MARATHON"
"[Six hours have passed. Kirk and his partner dance by Lorelai and Rory]"
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk, relax. Dancing's supposed to be fun."
"KIRK: You know what will be fun, Lorelai? Jogging around your prostrate body with that shiny temple of silver importance hoisted in the air for all to see. That will be fun. [dances away]"
"LORELAI: Do you think serious Kirk is more disturbing than non-serious Kirk?"
"RORY: Actually, I think they're both about the same."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Follow me."
"[they dance over to Dean]"
"DEAN: Wow, you guys look great."
"RORY: Hey, you came."
"DEAN: Hey, you're standing."
"LORELAI: Hey, we had coffee."
"DEAN: I can tell. So, how's it going?"
"RORY: Oh, it's been pretty quiet so far. However, I do believe "
"ANDREW: [in background] You went out with Liam Neeson! Are you kidding me?"
"LORELAI: Right on time!"
"ANDREW: Why would you ever tell me that you went out with Liam Neeson? Why would you do that?"
"WOMAN: Because I was trying to be honest."
"ANDREW: I don't believe that A, you actually went out with Liam Neeson, and B, that you would choose to tell me now at this moment that you went out with Liam Neeson!"
"WOMAN: Andrew!"
"ANDREW: No!"
"WOMAN: Andrew!"
"ANDREW: I can't stand Liam Neeson! [storms off]"
"RORY: See, fun!"
"LORELAI: And no one's even thrown up yet."
"DEAN: Okay, well, uh, I'm just gonna go sit over there and watch for awhile. Maybe I'll get lucky."
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: Well, that's sweet. Spectator Ken."
"RORY: Just keep dancing, you."
"[Kirk dances by and flips his partner]"
"LORELAI: Flip all you want, pal. This ain't the Olympics. It's who's left standing at the end that matters, not how fancy you are getting there."
"[Kirk and his partner dance away]"
"LORELAI: Let me flip you."
"RORY: No way."
"LORELAI: Come on!"
"RORY: You are not flipping me."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: You flip me."
"RORY: No need, you've already flipped."
"LORELAI: One cartwheel."
"RORY: Silence."
"[Jess and Shane walk across the dance floor to the bleachers]"
"TAYLOR: Unauthorized persons on the dance floor. Unauthorized persons on the dance floor. Security! Security! Security!"
"LORELAI: Well, look who's suddenly interested in dance."
"RORY: Yeah, he's a regular Martha Graham."
"[Rory watches Jess and Shane kiss]"
"CUT TO LATER IN THE MARATHON"
"[Fourteen hours have passed. Everyone is tired and dancing very slowly. Rory is trying to sleep on Lorelai's shoulder. Lorelai sees Kirk dancing toward them.]"
"LORELAI: [to Rory] Kirk."
"RORY: Mm?"
"[they start dancing more lively until Kirk passes by]"
"RORY: How much longer?"
"LORELAI: Oh, chin up soldier. We should be getting a break pretty soon."
"RORY: I hope so."
"[Jackson and Sookie dance over to them]"
"JACKSON: Oh good, there she is."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, please."
"LORELAI: Hey guys."
"JACKSON: Well, hey to you, too. Listen, I wanted to ask you, what do you think of my hair?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"JACKSON: My hair. How's it look to you? Any opinion?"
"LORELAI: It looks fine."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, you're overacting."
"JACKSON: You think? How bout you, Lorelai? You think I'm overreacting?"
"LORELAI: Jackson, what?"
"[a horn sounds]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"RORY: What, what?"
"LORELAI: The runaround."
"RORY: The runaround? That does not sound good."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, baby. I'm so, so sorry."
"TAYLOR: Ladies and Gentlemen, on your marks. . .get set. . .and go!"
"[all the dancers start running in a circle around the gym]"
"TAYLOR: Round and round they go, but when the song stops, nobody knows! But the last five couples that finish behind the red line are automatically out, so hold onto your partner and move, move, move!"
"MISS PATTY: You're getting too much pleasure out of this, Taylor."
"[Jackson and Sookie are running behind Lorelai and Rory]"
"JACKSON: Hey Lorelai, just wondering, how's my running? Got an opinion on that?"
"LORELAI: Jackson, what's going on?"
"SOOKIE: Nothing. He's mad at me and he's taking it out on you."
"JACKSON: Oh, I'm not mad. I just didn't realize that when I married Sookie, I also married you. I didn't realize I was a Mormon, my mistake."
"RORY: I need to interject for one second to tell you that I hate you!"
"LORELAI: Thanks, honey."
"SOOKIE: Quit trying to drag Lorelai into this."
"JACKSON: Fine, I will. [walks off the dance floor]"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, wait! Yellow cards, right here! I've got them for the both of us. We'll be right back! [follows after him]"
"TAYLOR: One of you is supposed to stay here. Hey!"
"RORY: I think I'm going to die."
"LORELAI: Me first."
"RORY: How much longer?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I just know that every year I block this part out."
"RORY: From now on I'm going to remind you of it."
"[Lorelai notices Kirk running right on their heels]"
"LORELAI: Kirk, what are you doing?"
"KIRK: I'm drafting you."
"LORELAI: Well, stop it!"
"KIRK: You can't tell me where to run!"
"LORELAI: Kirk, I swear to God, don't make me come back there!"
"[a horn sounds]"
"TAYLOR: Ten minute break everyone, ten minute break. Well run. Ten minute break, everyone. Ten minute break."
"[Several people, including Lorelai and Rory, collapse on the gym floor; Rory starts moving her leg around]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"RORY: I'm trying to kick you but I can't reach."
"LORELAI: I would help you but I can't move."
"RORY: Can I owe you one?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, no problem. Okay, okay, heart returning to normal. I have to go find Jackson and Sookie."
"RORY: I'll get us a couple of sandwiches."
"LORELAI: Good idea. [they stand up] This is fun, huh?"
"RORY: Uh huh, big fun."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S"
"[Jess walks up to Lane's table]"
"JESS: So, not dancing?"
"LANE: Nope."
"JESS: Why not? Too cool?"
"LANE: Go away, Jess. No one asked for a Tony Manero wannabe to drop by."
"JESS: Hey, I'm just here for the food."
"LANE: [hands him a sandwich] Here, enjoy, buh-bye."
"JESS: I noticed Rory's not dancing with Dean."
"LANE: Nothing gets past you, does it."
"JESS: How come? Trouble in paradise?"
"LANE: Rory's dancing with her mother. Nothing's wrong with her and Dean, and you're blocking my sandwiches from the rest of the room."
"JESS: I know. They're erecting a statue to me in the park next week."
"MRS. KIM: Who are you?"
"JESS: Jess. . . ma'am."
"MRS. KIM: [to Lane] Scoop more."
"[Mrs. Kim walks away. Rory and Dean walk up to the table]"
"RORY: The sandwiches are for the dancers."
"JESS: I'm dancing on the inside."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"JESS: I live here."
"RORY: You have nothing better to do than to sit around inside a gymnasium all day staring at a dance marathon?"
"JESS: I don't know. [to Dean] Do you have nothing better to do than sit inside a gymnasium all day staring at a dance marathon?"
"DEAN: I wouldn't direct any sort of comment toward me if I were you."
"JESS: I'm just trying to support my town."
"RORY: Good, then go back to New York."
"JESS: Ooh. Zing. I've been snapped."
"RORY: You think you're bugging me sitting in front of me staring like that?"
"JESS: You think you're bugging me dancing in front of me staring like that?"
"RORY: I'm not staring at you."
"JESS: Then how do you know I'm staring at you?"
"RORY: I am dancing. I cannot control where my glance goes. And the few moments that I can control it, my glance goes to Dean, not to you."
"JESS: So you can't control when you look at me, but you have to force yourself to look at him? Sorry, man. That's cold."
"DEAN: My former comment still stands."
"RORY: Go home."
"JESS: No, thanks."
"RORY: Then get out of my way."
"JESS: Didn't realize I was in your way. There you go. It's all yours. God help you."
"[Shane walks over to them]"
"SHANE: Where did you go? I've been sitting out there for twenty minutes."
"JESS: The break's only for ten."
"SHANE: It's just a saying."
"JESS: I came to get food."
"SHANE: Good, I'm starved."
"RORY: The food is for the dancers."
"SHANE: Who are you, Bobby Brady? Get a life."
"JESS: Rory's feeling a little territorial today."
"SHANE: Whatever. God, what is this thing?"
"DEAN: Rory, get your stuff and let's go."
"JESS: Ooh, that was good. Now say then get in there and make me my supper.'"
"RORY: I got them."
"DEAN: Come on."
"JESS: See you in there. [they leave] I'm gonna get a soda."

"LUKE: Nope."

"[Jackson and Sookie walk up to them]"
"JACKSON: Okay, I need to say something here."
"LORELAI: Oh, I've been looking all over for you."
"SOOKIE: I wish you would just drop this."
"JACKSON: Contrary to your belief, there are some things in life that you do not have the right to have an opinion on."
"LORELAI: What?"
"JACKSON: And the rate at which I have kids and the amount of kids I wish to have falls directly under that category"
"LORELAI: Sookie, what did you tell him?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, you see, once again, my communication k*ll  not so good."
"LORELAI: Jackson, I didn't mean to get involved in any of this."
"JACKSON: No? Telling Sookie that she needs to immediately inform me that four in four is crazy?"
"LORELAI: Aw, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, it did come out something like that."
"LORELAI: Aw man."
"LUKE: What's four in four?"
"LORELAI: Four kids in four years."
"LUKE: That is crazy."
"JACKSON: Oh good, yes, let's open this up to even more discussion."
"LUKE: One kid in four years is crazy."
"JACKSON: Hey."
"LUKE: Sorry, go ahead, drop another sucker in this mess."
"LORELAI: Okay, raise your hand if you're not helping."
"JACKSON: Does anyone here understand that a man has a right not to have his personal life debated in a public forum? I am not Winona Ryder."
"SOOKIE: Well, I know that."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, Jackson, I didn't mean "
"JACKSON: My child-bearing arrangements are between me and Sookie."
"LUKE: And the Lord. Still not helping?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, just please calm down."
"JACKSON: I will calm down. I'll calm down at home."
"SOOKIE: But what about the contest?"
"JACKSON: To hell with the contest! I'm quitting the contest. That is, if it's okay with Lorelai, or Luke, or that strange man in the corner who I've never met. Excuse me, strange man in the corner? Is it okay if I quit this contest? [storms off]"
"SOOKIE: I'm so sorry. I got tongue-tied and things just started coming out and I couldn't stop them and. . ."
"LORELAI: Go."

"[Twenty-three hours have passed. Taylor is drunk at the podium, babbling to Miss Patty]"
"TAYLOR: And then I'd say what is this in your ear' and I'd pull out a bright shiny penny and then whole room would laugh and clap."
"MISS PATTY: Yeah, I'm sure they did, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Yeah. Have you ever levitated a rottweiler?"
"MISS PATTY: No."
"TAYLOR: Not easy. But in a cape with a wand and a shiny black top hat. . ."

"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: My heel broke."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: My heel just broke off. Damn, these are brand new shoes, too."
"RORY: They were made in 1943."
"LORELAI: Well, I just bought them Tuesday."
"RORY: I told you not to wear vintage shoes."
"LORELAI: But the lady at the store said that they hadn't been worn a lot."
"RORY: Yeah, but not a lot in sixty years is still a lot."
"LORELAI: I gotta fix them. I'll use my emergency card. I'll be right back."
"RORY: No, stop. If you leave, there's no way I'll be able to stand up on my own."

"LUKE: Let me see it."
"LORELAI: I only have ten minutes  please."
"LUKE: I think I have some glue back at the diner."
"LORELAI: Glue, yes  we love glue!"
"LUKE: I wouldn't say that too loudly if I were you."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Luke leaves, Sookie walks up to Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: Hey. Are you guys out?"
"LORELAI: No, my shoe broke. Luke's fixing it."
"SOOKIE: Oh, good. Listen, I just feel terrible about what happened."
"LORELAI: I know. How's Jackson?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, he's fine. We went home, and he calmed down, and we talked. He totally understands and he's open to anything I want."
"LORELAI: That's great."
"SOOKIE: Now, tell me what I want."
"LORELAI: No way."
"SOOKIE: But I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: Then flip a coin cause I am staying so far out of this."
"SOOKIE: You're my best friend."
"LORELAI: Yes, I am, and I can only remain your best friend as long as Jackson doesn't k*ll me."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai. . ."
"LORELAI: Sookie, he's a produce man. They'll never find the body, but the squash will be especially chatty that year."
"SOOKIE: Okay, fair enough."
"LORELAI: Hey, take your time. That's it. That's all I have to say."
"SOOKIE: Thank you."
"[Luke returns with the glue]"
"LUKE: Got it."
"LORELAI: Ah, good."
"SOOKIE: Well, I'm going home to figure out what I want. Good luck. Call me tomorrow."
"LORELAI: I will."
"[Sookie leaves]"
"LUKE: So, how's that situation going?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it'll be okay."
"LUKE: Good. Uh, listen, uh, I didn't really mean all that stuff I said earlier."
"LORELAI: What stuff?"
"LUKE: Uh, the kid stuff, you know."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's no big deal."
"LUKE: Yeah, I know, I just. . .I'm not really as anti-kid as I might have come off."
"LORELAI: Drop another sucker in. . ."
"LUKE: Okay, yes. I don't always have the patience for them. They tend to be a little squishy, and that freaks me out a little."
"LORELAI: You don't have to want kids, Luke. Or like kids. It's not for everybody."
"LUKE: I know, but. . .although I'm quite happy going an entire day without having to deal with somebody else's bodily functions, if I ever happen to meet the right person. . .well, it would be a discussion."
"LORELAI: A discussion."
"LUKE: Yes. Probably a short discussion, but still. Here, hold this. So what about you  you ever think about having another kid?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know how much fun it would be without biology finals and headgear. . . but sure, if I ever happen to meet the right person, another kid might be nice."
"[they stare at each other for a moment]"
"LUKE: Your shoe'll be ready in a minute"
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S"
"[Lane is sitting out front. She gets up and walks back inside to the food table, and Dave walks up to her]"
"DAVE: One sandwich please."
"LANE: Hi."
"DAVE: Hi."
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"DAVE: Uh, well, you mentioned this thing last time we talked and it sounded very Blue Velvet so I figured I would come by and check it out."
"LANE: What do you think?"
"DAVE: Uh, I think you held back."
"LANE: Yeah, well. . ."
"DAVE: Anyhow, I hadn't seen you in awhile, and I thought I'd come down and maybe we could figure something out on this band issue."
"LANE: Sure, we could do that."
"DAVE: Plus, I missed you."
"LANE: You did? You missed me?"
"DAVE: Well, yeah. Did you miss me?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah, definitely. I definitely, definitely missed you."
"DAVE: Glad and relieved to hear it."
"[Mrs. Kim walks over to them]"
"MRS. KIM: Who are you, what do you want?"
"LANE: Mama."
"MRS. KIM: Do you know this boy?"
"LANE: Well "
"DAVE: Uh, no, actually, I just heard a bunch of people talking outside about the sandwiches and I thought that I would come in and maybe try one. I'm sorry, may I? [Mrs. Kim hands him a sandwich] Thank you. [takes a bite] That's delicious."
"LANE: Really?"
"DAVE: May I have another one for later please?"
"MRS. KIM: Yes, that's fine. Take another one."
"DAVE: Thank you. You know, my parents would love these sandwiches. I wish I could bring them by but unfortunately they're in private bible study right now."
"MRS. KIM: Bible study?"
"DAVE: Say, how long are you serving?"
"MRS. KIM: Why?"
"DAVE: Well, I thought that if they got out in time I could bring them on over."
"MRS. KIM: Well, the bread is only good for another twenty minutes, after that there's no point. You chip a tooth."
"DAVE: Okay. So if I can get my parents back here in twenty minutes, then you'll still be serving, but in thirty you're done?"
"MRS. KIM: That's right."
"DAVE: Great. So if for some reason I'm not back here in twenty minutes, that means that I'm gonna be over there, on the church steps, waiting for my parents to get out so that I can tell them about the great sandwiches that they missed. Okay? Okay, great. Thanks a lot and I hope to see you soon. [leaves]"
"MRS. KIM: I hope he comes back. He seemed hungry."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE GYM"
"[Rory and Dean are still dancing. Jess and Shane sitting on the bleachers]"
"RORY: He's still there."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: Jess. He's still there. I can't believe he's still there."
"DEAN: Just ignore him."
"RORY: Yeah. You know, this is a dance marathon. You're not supposed to come and sit and watch, you're supposed to dance. He's just trying to bug me, sitting there right in front of me, staring. Jerk."
"SHANE: I'm bored."
"JESS: Okay."
"[they start kissing]"
"RORY: There they go again! God, I swear, why can't they just get a room? Or forget a room  get a park bench, or a doorway, or even a strategically placed telephone pole would probably suffice. I mean, girls like Shane  what is it with them? Don't they see what they look like? I know they have mirrors."
"JESS: Hey, you talking about me?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: I heard you mention Shane."
"RORY: Shane isn't you."
"JESS: Shane concerns me."
"RORY: Shane concerns me, too  and all women, for that matter."
"JESS: You got a problem here?"
"RORY: Nope. Just a little sick of seeing the two of you sitting there. If you're not gonna participate, then why don't you just leave?"
"SHANE: That works for me. Let's go."
"JESS: No."
"RORY: Why not?"
"JESS: Because I'm not ready to go."
"RORY: Oh really?"
"JESS: Yes, really. I'm gonna sit here as long as I like, and I'm gonna do whatever I like, and if you don't like it, then just ignore me and pay attention to your boyfriend."
"DEAN: Sorry, she can't. I'm not her boyfriend anymore."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: You know, I tried to ignore this. I really did, but I don't know what the hell I was thinking."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"DEAN: You don't wanna be with me, Rory."
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"DEAN: Oh, please! You've been into him since he got to town, and I have spent weeks  months, actually  trying to convince myself that it wasn't true, that everything was fine between us. But now I know that I was an idiot. You're into him and he's into you, and Shane, who by the way, should be listening to this cause it's so damn obvious."
"RORY: What's obvious? What did I do?"
"DEAN: Everyone can see, Rory! Everyone. And I'm tired, but I'm over it, so go ahead, go. Be together. There's nothing standing in your way now, cause I'm out."
"[Dean grabs his jacket from the bleachers and leaves]"
"TAYLOR: I don't see a yellow card. I don't see a yellow card. Excuse me, young lady. . .whose name I don't remember right now. . . ugh, no one listens to me."
"MISS PATTY: I know, honey."
"CUT TO THE BRIDGE"
"[Rory is sitting on the bridge as Jess walks up to her]"
"JESS: Dean's a jerk. Yelling at you like that, breaking up in front of everybody. . .the guy's a total jerk."
"RORY: No, he's not. He's right. Everything he said. All those things about you and me, all those things about me lying to him, and messing with his head. He was right. Well, wasn't he? Fine, he was right about me, then. Now go away."
"JESS: He was right. . . about all of it."
"RORY: So, what now?"
"JESS: You're definitely broken up with Dean?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm definitely broken up with Dean."
"JESS: Okay. I have to go take care of something then."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE GYMNASIUM"
"[Only two couples are left: Kirk and his partner, and another couple. The woman of the other couple falls to the ground]"
"KIRK: They're out! They're out! We won! We won! [runs over to Miss Patty and wakes her up]"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, oh, oh. Taylor, wake up! It's over. Taylor, blow the horn."
"TAYLOR: [asleep on some chairs] . . .a quarter right out of your ear."
"MISS PATTY: Taylor, the horn. Oh, for Pete's Sake. [Patty blows the air horn] Okay, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner!"
"[Lorelai rushes over to them]"
"LORELAI: Wait, what are you doing? I'm here, I'm standing, I used my yellow card!"
"KIRK: I win, I win! I win, I win, I win, I win!"
"LORELAI: You didn't win! I'm still here! Patty, where's Rory?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, she ran off the floor a little while ago, honey."
"LORELAI: What? No!"
"KIRK: Yes!"
"MISS PATTY: For the fifth year in a row, ladies and gentlemen, the marathon winner is Donna Delain and Kirk!"
"[Lorelai sees Rory across the gym, and she walks over to her]"
"LORELAI: Rory, what happened? Where did you go? [sees that Rory is crying] Oh, Rory, honey! Oh."
"[Lorelai and Rory hug while Kirk runs around the gym with the trophy]"

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking slowly down the sidewalk]"
"LORELAI: Mmkay, still walking, all's good. Huh. Mmkay."
"RORY: How are you?"
"LORELAI: I should probably keep moving."
"RORY: God, my feet have never been in this much pain before."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah, what about that time?"
"RORY: What time?"
"LORELAI: The time when I did the thing and your feet were . . .gotta stop."
"RORY: Gotta sit."
"[they sit down on a bale of hay]"
"RORY: Ugh. What were you saying?"
"LORELAI: About what?"
"RORY: About my feet."
"LORELAI: What about your feet?"
"RORY: I don't know. You were talking about the thing you did to my feet."
"LORELAI: What thing?"
"RORY: The thing that you. . .you and. . .huh?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Just an observation  you and I do not function well on a funky sleeping pattern."
"RORY: I feel jet-lagged."
"LORELAI: You've been up twenty-four hours straight."
"RORY: Yes, why did I do that?"
"LORELAI: Because I asked you to."
"RORY: And that worked?"
"LORELAI: At the time. I don't expect it to again."
"RORY: A realist, I like that."
"LORELAI: How far is Luke's?"
"RORY: It's right over there."
"LORELAI: It looks far."
"RORY: Very far."
"LORELAI: Maybe if we concentrate really hard, our combined psychic powers will move it closer."
"[they stare at the diner]"
"RORY: I don't think it's working."
"LORELAI: It's my fault, I'm not focusing."
"RORY: Yes, that must be why we can't move a half a city block closer to us."
"LORELAI: All right then, let's go. On the count of three."
"[Neither of them move]"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. Thank you."
"RORY: I never realized Luke's was a hundred miles away."
"LORELAI: We're lucky it wasn't snowing. It would've been The Donner Party all over again, but with slightly better hair. Why are you sitting over there?"
"RORY: Where?"
"LORELAI: At that table."
"RORY: Huh. How did I get here?"
"LORELAI: You sat there."
"RORY: Well, this chair's very close to that chair, so you understand how I could've made the mistake."
"LORELAI: Move over here with me."
"RORY: Why don't you move over here with me?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm not the one who sat in the wrong chair."
"RORY: I think it's a little presumptuous to assume that my chair is the wrong chair when my chair could just as easily be the right chair."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm the leader of the clan, the provider of the household, the alpha male, and the one whose feet just fell asleep so there's absolutely no chance of movement."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Thank you. See, it's nice sitting at the grown-up table, isn't it?"
"RORY: Uh huh."
"[Kirk enters the diner carrying his dance marathon trophy]"
"KIRK: Oh, excuse me, did my trophy bump you?"
"LORELAI: No, Kirk, it didn't."
"KIRK: Good, because the size of it is so large that sometimes I can't judge where the exact end of it is."
"LORELAI: We're fine, Kirk."
"KIRK: I'm glad, because these shiny golden edges are actually very sharp. They could take an eye out or cause a deep gash completely unintentionally."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"KIRK: It's almost more a w*apon than a trophy."
"LORELAI: Really? Can I hold it, then?"
"LUKE: Get out of the way, Kirk. You're blocking the door."
"KIRK: Luke, I'll be needing one of your larger tables this morning, since your smaller tables simply cannot accommodate the sheer size of my massive trophy."
"LUKE: Put it on the floor."
"KIRK: It needs its own chair."
"LUKE: It's gonna need some glue if you don't sit down pretty soon."
"KIRK: Everybody hates a winner."
"LORELAI: Hey, how bout one person gets pancakes and one person gets eggs and then we can share?"
"RORY: I can't, I have to go."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? It's "
"[Rory shows Lorelai her watch]"
"LORELAI: [gasps] It took us thirty minutes to get here?"
"RORY: Lots of limping."
"LORELAI: Wow, sh**t. Well, at least grab a donut before you go. Hey, unh, Luke, uh, we need a couple of donuts, and, uh, some of those extra legs Heather Mills is sending over to Croatia."
"LUKE: Coming right up."
"[Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"JESS: Hi."
"LUKE: Hi."
"RORY: I have to get to school."
"JESS: Yeah, me too."
"RORY: Bye"
"JESS: Bye. Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"LUKE: Bye."
"[Rory leaves. Jess goes back upstairs]"
"LUKE: What the hell was that?"
"LORELAI: That was episode one of Rory and Jess: The Early Years."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Rory and Jess are together."
"LUKE: Are you serious? What about Dean?"
"LORELAI: Dean and Rory broke up at the dance."
"LUKE: They did? I was at the dance, how come I didn't know about this?"
"LORELAI: Because you're you."
"LUKE: But why, what happened?"
"LORELAI: Jess happened."
"LUKE: Wow, wow. So. . ."
"LORELAI: Yup."
"LUKE: Wow. Well, this is great."
"LORELAI: I'll tell Dean you said that."
"LUKE: You know what I mean, Rory and Jess, Jess and Rory. I think this is great. Don't you think this is great?"
"LORELAI: I think Rory's seventeen and it's probably about time for a Jess."
"LUKE: Look, I know Jess is a little tough sometimes, but he likes Rory and Rory's a good kid, hopefully she'll rub off on him."
"LORELAI: You know what, I've spent a lot of time and energy fighting the whole Jess thing. Rory's made her choice, I want her to be happy. I'm just hoping for the best at this point."
"LUKE: Very romantic."
"LORELAI: Says the man who yelled ""Finally!"" at the end of Love Story."
"LUKE: I'll get you coffee."
"LORELAI: Thank you very much."
"CUT TO THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Richard are sitting at the table. Emily is standing at the doorway to the kitchen]"
"EMILY: Do it again, please! [walks to her seat at the table] I'm not quite sure what other way there is to say no walnuts in the salad' except to say no walnuts in the salad.'"
"LORELAI: Mom, she just made a mistake."
"EMILY: She doesn't listen, she doesn't care, she has no work ethic."
"LORELAI: She has some work ethic. You made her remake the salad four times."
"EMILY: I like things done correctly."
"RICHARD: Preferably the first time."
"EMILY: Thank you, Richard."
"LORELAI: You know, Mom, in Europe, they eat the salad last and the main course first."
"EMILY: We're not in Europe."
"LORELAI: We could pretend."
"EMILY: Really, Lorelai, you can't wait ten minutes for another salad? The situation's that dire?"
"LORELAI: Four salads ago, no, not dire. Right now it's your money for nothing and your chicks for free.'"
"EMILY: Rory?"
"RORY: She didn't have lunch."
"EMILY: Fine."
"RICHARD: Where are you going?"
"EMILY: Apparently, we're going to be European tonight."
"RICHARD: Oh, wonderful. I was getting so tired of being American day after day after day."
"LORELAI: God, I'm starved."
"RORY: Think about something else."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"RORY: Something disgusting that will take your appetite away."
"LORELAI: Ari Fleischer?"
"RICHARD: Ari Fleischer is our nation's mouthpiece, young lady."
"LORELAI: Officially not hungry now."
"EMILY: Liliana will be right out with the sand dabs. I'm afraid we're going to have to let her go, Richard."
"RICHARD: Oh, if that's how you feel, Emily."
"LORELAI: You're firing someone over putting walnuts in a salad?"
"EMILY: I'm going to fire someone over putting walnuts in the salad after she was told not to put walnuts in the salad."
"LORELAI: Mom, you know, if you're not a little nicer to your help, you might find yourself in a Frank Lloyd Wright situation."
"RICHARD: Frank Lloyd Wright?"
"EMILY: What on earth does Frank Lloyd Wright have to do with my salad?"
"RICHARD: And your walnuts."
"LORELAI: Mrs. Wright apparently had this major problem with her help. She was very rough on them and they totally hated her. So this guy who had worked for her forever, he had finally had enough. I believe the incident was over walnuts, wasn't it, honey?"
"RORY: The exact cause has not been proven."
"LORELAI: Anyhow, Mrs. Wright invites this whole posse of people over for dinner and they're all sitting around eating, and Mr. Disgruntled Servant Guy goes outside and locks all the doors and windows and douses the whole house in gasoline and sets the place on fire."
"EMILY: My goodness."
"LORELAI: So the house is on fire, and people are freaking out, so they run to the doors but the doors are locked, so a few of them try to get out through the windows, but Mr. Angry-Puss is standing outside with an ax hacking them to death and so they all died."
"EMILY: Why on earth would you tell me that story?"
"LORELAI: All I'm saying is sometimes eating a walnut is preferable to getting hacked to death or set on fire during dinner."
"EMILY: One of these days I'm going to make you eat in your room."
"RORY: I'm going to go get myself another soda. Would anyone else like something?"
"LORELAI: I'd like a big bag of walnuts, and make sure you tell her they're for me."
"RICHARD: I believe I need a little more ice. Emily, are you fine?"
"EMILY: Yes, Richard, I'm fine, thank you."
"[Lorelai sniffs the air]"
"EMILY: Oh, stop that!"
"CUT TO THE KITCHEN"
"[Rory pulls a soda out of the fridge as Richard walks in]"
"RICHARD: Did you find it?"
"RORY: Yes, I did."
"RICHARD: Good, good. Ah, here we are, ice. And. . .chocolates."
"RORY: Bless you."
"RICHARD: So, tell me, how's it going at school?"
"RORY: It's good. It's crazy."
"RICHARD: Senior year."
"RORY: Yup."
"RICHARD: Preparing for college can be a daunting task. I remember when I was preparing for Yale."
"RORY: Bad?"
"RICHARD: I don't believe I slept the entire year. I didn't even cut my hair for two months."
"RORY: Grandpa!"
"RICHARD: Oh, yes, it was quite a scandal. But in the end, it was all worth it."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"RICHARD: My years at Yale were absolutely the most gratifying ones of my life. Just the sheer freedom of knowing that anything I wanted to learn, I could learn right there. Plus, the history of the place, the heritage. . .my father went to Yale."
"RORY: I know."
"RICHARD: I also made wonderful friends there. Friends I still have today."
"RORY: That must be nice."
"RICHARD: I'm going to be going back there next week. There's going to be a little reunion of the Whiffenpoofs."
"RORY: I'm sorry, the what?"
"RICHARD: It's an a cappella singing group I belonged to at Yale."
"RORY: A singing group?"
"RICHARD: A very famous singing group, actually. Like the b*at, but with better table manners."
"RORY: I've never heard you sing."
"RICHARD: Well, I'm no Perry Como, but my shower hasn't kicked me out yet. Anyway, a group of us are going to get together at the old alma mater and have a little dinner, swap some w*r stories."
"RORY: Sounds fun."
"[the maid walks by with a tray]"
"MAID: Excuse me."
"RORY: Uh, did you see what I just saw?"
"RICHARD: Walnuts."
"RORY: Poor Grandma."
"RICHARD: Poor us. You know, you might wanna come with me next week."
"RORY: Come with you where?"
"RICHARD: To Yale."
"RORY: What?"
"RICHARD: Oh, I don't mean to the dinner, that would be boring for you, but you might enjoy seeing the school."
"RORY: Well "
"RICHARD: Your mother could come to. It would be a fun little adventure."
"RORY: Wow."
"RICHARD: We could drive down, have a little roadside snack, get there about noon. Have a little tour, and then the two of you girls could go off and have fun, and the old folks can have a somber little dinner. I think you'd love to see it. I certainly would love to show it to you."
"RORY: Well. . .sure, Grandpa. That would be nice."
"RICHARD: Wonderful. Oh, I'm thrilled. Uh, do you wanna tell your mother or shall I?"
"RORY: Oh, you know what, I can tell her."
"RICHARD: All right, you tell her. [the maid rushes past them again] Looks like we're gonna need a few more of these."
"RORY: Yeah."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the house]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I officially vote that we send my mother an anonymous note requesting that she never make us the sand dabs again."
"RORY: I'm not sure how anonymous it would be considering she said we were the first people she ever made them for."
"[they get into the car and Lorelai starts the engine]"
"RORY: I have to tell you something."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Grandpa talked to me tonight."
"[Lorelai turns off the engine]"
"RORY: Why'd you turn the car off?"
"LORELAI: I'm just getting the sense that I shouldn't be driving a large vehicle when you tell me this."
"RORY: It's no big deal."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: It's not."
"LORELAI: Then tell me."
"RORY: Okay. Um, well, Grandpa was mentioning that he and Grandma are going on a trip next week, a driving trip somewhere, and he invited me to go. And you. He invited you and me to go on a trip with him and Grandma."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Where's the driving trip to?"
"RORY: Yale."
"[Lorelai gets out of the car and walks toward the porch. Rory follows her]"
"RORY: Mom? Mom, wait."
"LORELAI: No, it's okay, I got it."
"RORY: He's going for some nostalgia thing. For a reunion of, I don't know, the Whiffenhoofs."
"LORELAI: Poofs."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Whiffenpoofs."
"RORY: Not much better."
"LORELAI: I totally agree."
"RORY: Well, he got all sentimental and he really just wants to show me the campus. It's no big deal."
"LORELAI: It's a huge deal."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: There's a reason he wants to drag you out there, Rory. He's manipulating you. Trust me, I know, he's a master at it."
"RORY: Okay, fine, maybe he is, but he really wants me to go, I can tell. And you don't have to go. I mean, he invited you and I would really love it if you could come, but really, you can stay home. Just please don't make a big thing out of this. This doesn't have to be a fight."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: We go. We look. Hi Yale. Bye Yale. It's over. No harm, no foul."
"LORELAI: How many more two-word sentences can you come up with?"
"RORY: You know, it doesn't have to be a total loss."
"LORELAI: Look, as she's leading me back to the car."
"RORY: I'm sure you and I can figure out a fun thing to do while they're off at dinner, some cool road trip thing."
"LORELAI: In New Haven?"
"RORY: Well, yeah."
"LORELAI: Sweetie, have you ever been to New Haven?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Take a look at the coffee pot tomorrow before I clean it, that's New Haven."
"RORY: We can make it fun. It would mean a lot to the grandparents, everybody wins."
"LORELAI: Rory, listen to me."
"RORY: I know, I am being manipulated. This is part of Grandpa's evil plan to take over my life, abolish my free will, pull me in into the Gilmore world, dress me in pearls, and ruin my life. Did I leave anything out?"
"LORELAI: Mm, let me see. . . manipulate, evil plan, no free will, pearls  no, I think you about covered it. Oh, wait  did you call my father the Puppet Master?"
"RORY: No, I did not."
"LORELAI: Always call him the Puppet Master."
"RORY: I will never make that mistake again."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is cleaning off a table as Kirk walks in]"
"KIRK: Luke, where's your lost and found?"
"LUKE: Out back in the dumpster."
"KIRK: I need your help. I don't know what to do. I'm shaking like a spastic colon."
"LUKE: What's the matter, Kirk?"
"KIRK: My trophy's gone."
"LUKE: What?"
"KIRK: Someone took her."
"LUKE: Kirk."
"KIRK: The last time I remember seeing her, she was next to me at the movies."
"LUKE: Stop calling it she."
"KIRK: I retraced my steps all day and nothing. I suspect foul play."
"LUKE: Foul play?"
"KIRK: Kidnapping, possibly."
"LUKE: Well, then, I think you should go to the police, and if they mention something about staying somewhere for observation, it's just routine."
"[Kirk starts to leave as Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hey Kirk."
"KIRK: Rory. [looks into her backpack]"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"KIRK: Where were you this morning at about ten?"
"RORY: At school."
"KIRK: Do you have any witnesses?"
"RORY: Yes."
"KIRK: Can you get them to make a short statement?"
"RORY: No."
"KIRK: Oh, well, okay. [leaves]"
"RORY: Someone took his statue again."
"LUKE: Yeah, yeah."
"RORY: Every year."
"LUKE: Well, there's some things in life that never let you down. So. . ."
"RORY: So. . ."
"LUKE: It's nice to see you, Rory."
"RORY: It's nice to see you, too, Luke."
"LUKE: So, table for one?"
"RORY: Um, I'll just sit at the counter."
"LUKE: Okay. What can I get you?"
"RORY: Um, I guess I'll have a cheeseburger."
"[Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"LUKE: Hey Jess, look who's here  Rory."
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Hi."
"LUKE: Okay, time to add another word. Jess, you want something to eat?"
"JESS: I'm not hungry."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry either."
"LUKE: What about the burger?"
"RORY: Oh, well. . .could you wrap it up? I'm gonna eat it later. I actually prefer burgers after they've been sitting around for awhile. Let's them age."
"LUKE: Okay."
"JESS: You know, I've got that book upstairs."
"RORY: Oh, the book we talked about?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: Great."
"JESS: We could go upstairs and look at it."
"RORY: Look at the book, sure. Let's go upstairs and look at the book."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory and Jess walk in]"
"JESS: So, here we are."
"RORY: Yup, here we are. Wow, I haven't seen it since you guys redid it."
"JESS: Oh yeah."
"RORY: It's bigger."
"JESS: Ripping a wall down can have that effect on a room"
"RORY: Yeah. That part, over there."
"JESS: That's mine."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Yeah. You want a soda?"
"RORY: No, I'm fine."
"JESS: Okay. You sure you don't want a soda?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm sure."
"JESS: Please let me get you a soda. I gotta do something other than stand here like a moron."
"RORY: Take comfort in the fact that you are not doing it alone."
"JESS: Okay, let's just regroup here."
"RORY: Yeah, regroup."
"JESS: First of all, we should try to get within, say, a foot of each other."
"RORY: Okay. I think that's about a foot."
"JESS: Huh, that school of yours is really paying off."
"RORY: So, now what?"
"JESS: Now we should. . ."
"RORY: Well, I think we either need to get a little closer or need to warm up."
"JESS: Okay. Hi."
"RORY: Hi."
"[they start to kiss when Luke bursts into the room]"
"LUKE: I got the burger."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LUKE: I also threw in some fries."
"RORY: Fries, great. I love fries. Okay, um, Jess, thank you for. . .um, your. . .um  I gotta go. [leaves]"
"LUKE: What was going on up here?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"LUKE: Nothing? I walk in here and the two of you are like shrapnel."
"JESS: Your timing is perfect, by the way. Next time I'll hang a sock on the door."
"LUKE: Hey, there will be no hanging of socks on the door in my house, do you hear me?"
"JESS: Relax, I was kidding."
"LUKE: Oh, really? Hanging socks on doors  that's your idea of funny."
"JESS: Depending on the sock design, could be hilarious."
"LUKE: Okay, that's it, sit down."
"JESS: Why?"
"LUKE: It's time to lay down a few ground rules, sit. All right, first off, when she is up here, that door stays open."
"JESS: Excuse me?"
"LUKE: You are not allowed on either end of this apartment. You are, instead, to remain here in the middle portion of the room. You may sit on the couch or on the chair, as long as you two are sitting on separate seats, i.e. when you're on the couch, then she's on the chair. When she's on the couch, then you're on the chair."
"JESS: I get it, thank you."
"LUKE: On weekdays, you will have her home by nine. On weekends, you will have her home by eleven. Any evidence of alcohol, cigarette smoke, or anything else that Nancy Reagan would find unacceptable and you will not be allowed near her without an adult present. Are these rules clear?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: Good."
"JESS: May I speak?"
"LUKE: If you must."
"JESS: Do you want me to have you committed or would you prefer to check yourself in?"
"LUKE: I'm not joking here, mister."
"JESS: You know you're my guardian, not hers, right?"
"LUKE: You don't need a guardian."
"JESS: She tried to kiss me."
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: She did that thing where you stretch and then you put your arm around the other person's shoulder and then you sneeze and then your hand falls and you try to grab "
"LUKE: Jess, stop it."
"JESS: What do you think is gonna happen?"
"LUKE: You know what I think is gonna happen."
"JESS: No, I don't. Tell me. Tell me what I'm gonna do to her."
"LUKE: You're not gonna do anything to her because when you're at her place, there's Lorelai, and when you're here, there's me, and when you're out there, there's Taylor."
"JESS: Romeo and Juliet had warring families and they still managed to do a little damage, you know?"
"LUKE: Well, as soon as I catch you in a pair of tights, I'll get worried. Until then, do your homework."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen with a duffel bag]"
"LORELAI: Rory, let's move! They'll be here any minute."
"RORY: I'll be right there."
"LORELAI: And make sure to bring an extra coat."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Do not ask why. It's Gilmore road rules, trust me."
"RORY: But that doesn't make any sense. We're only gonna be gone for one day."
"LORELAI: Yeah, do me a favor, say those exact words to my mother when she shows up."
"RORY: Taking the coat."
"LORELAI: Now, I have been doing some research on our trip."
"RORY: Oh yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I went to the bookstore and I found this. [shows Rory a very thin book]"
"RORY: ""The Best of New Haven."""
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: It's light."
"LORELAI: It's New Haven. Anyhow, I looked through it and it just so happens that one of the best taco places on the East Coast is ten minutes from campus."
"RORY: We like tacos."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do. [reads] ""You haven't had a taco until you've spent some time at Hector's, crisp and meaty  """
"RORY: Dirty."
"LORELAI: Thank you. ""Not greasy. With homemade tortillas, it elevates this fast finger food to the level of haute cuisine."""
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, so I thought maybe when Dad was busy poofing it up, we could go say hello to Hector."
"RORY: I like your thinking."
"LORELAI: Good. Where's your stuff?"
"RORY: I put the extra coat by the door."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but where's your stuff?"
"RORY: What stuff?"
"LORELAI: Rory, I left a list on your dresser last night."
"RORY: I thought you were kidding."
"LORELAI: You didn't pack?"
"RORY: Well "
"[They walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Rory, let me explain something to you. The way you survive a road trip with my mother is to make sure you have all your bases covered, leave nothing to chance. Never give her the opportunity to give you a thirty-minute lecture on how, if you'd brought the second bathing suit like she told you to, it wouldn't have mattered that the first one's strap broke in a freak poolslide incident that no one, including the Amazing Kreskin, could've predicted, you would've been covered."
"RORY: I have to bring a bathing suit? It's thirty degrees outside."
"LORELAI: This was an example based on a true story. Now, get a skirt to go with this."
"RORY: But I'm still confused. When are we changing?"
"LORELAI: Not the point."
"RORY: We're driving, we're walking, we're eating tacos, and we're driving again."
"LORELAI: Check the list."
"RORY: Why do I need rain boots?"
"LORELAI: Why are you still questioning me?"
"RORY: Should I bring both a rain hat and an umbrella, or will one or the other do? Forget it, stupid question."
"[Lorelai finds the bracelet that Dean made for Rory on the dresser]"
"LORELAI: Oh wow. I guess this means there really isn't a Dean anymore, huh?"
"RORY: Yeah, that and it broke in the shower this morning. Though I probably would've taken it off anyway."
"LORELAI: Or Jess would've done it for you."
"RORY: What did that mean?"
"LORELAI: It just meant Jess wouldn't want you wearing another guy's bracelet."
"RORY: Or that Jess is a thief and he would've stolen it."
"LORELAI: It does work on both levels, doesn't it?"
"RORY: So this is how it's gonna be from now on?"
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: You like Dean and you hate Jess."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Jess will always be the evil guy who mouthed off to you and wrecked my car and Dean will always be the perfect guy who would come over and change the water bottle."
"LORELAI: Aw, I forgot about the water bottle."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Rory, I said nothing. I didn't mean what you thought I meant about Jess. I'm trying to be supportive about this."
"RORY: How supportive?"
"LORELAI: Supportive. You know, go team."
"RORY: I'm serious, I wanna know how it's gonna be. Like, can I invite him over?"
"LORELAI: Of course you can invite him over."
"RORY: Well, can he actually come into the house?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he can come into the house."
"RORY: Are you going to talk to him?"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"RORY: Are you going to talk to him?"
"LORELAI: I'll at least match him grunt for grunt."
"RORY: Okay. Now, let's say he's in the house and there's a fire, and you can either save him or your shoes  which is it?"
"LORELAI: That depends  did he start the fire?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Rory, I promised you before and I'm promising you again, I will cut this kid all kinds of slack. Did I like Dean? Yes. Did I worry about you less when you were with Dean? Yes. But I never expected you to be with Dean forever, just like I don't expect you to be with Jess forever."
"RORY: Oh, so now you're just waiting for the day I'm not with Jess anymore, is that it?"
"LORELAI: You know what, I'm actually looking forward to my mother getting here."
"RORY: I'm kidding and thank you."
"LORELAI: You're annoying, and you're welcome. [doorbell rings] Let the games begin."
"CUT TO THE FRONT DOOR"
"[Emily and Richard are standing on the porch]"
"EMILY: Your drivers have arrived."
"RORY: Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Hello Rory, hello Lorelai. What a perfect day for a drive."
"LORELAI: Sure is."
"EMILY: You brought an umbrella?"
"RORY: And a rain cap."
"EMILY: Excellent!"
"RICHARD: Here, let me help you with those."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[As they walk to the car, Emily notices Lorelai is carrying a coffee travel mug]"
"EMILY: Where are you going with that?"
"LORELAI: To the car."
"EMILY: You can't have that in the car."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: Well, then, what are you doing with it?"
"LORELAI: Walking it."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, I know I can't have it in the car. It will not be in the car."
"RICHARD: Is that everything?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I think so."
"RICHARD: All right, then. Let's get this show on the road."
"[Lorelai gets in the back seat and holds the mug out the window]"
"EMILY: Now let's see you drink it."
"[Lorelai sticks her head out the window and takes a sip]"
"LORELAI: Mm, good to the last drop."
"EMILY: You stay that way until it's gone."
"LORELAI: Aye, aye, captain."
"EMILY: Let's go Richard."
"RICHARD: All right-y."
"[Richard pulls away while Lorelai drinks her coffee out the window]"
"CUT TO YALE UNIVERSITY"
"[The four of them are walking through the campus]"
"LORELAI: Wow, does that guy look smart. I mean it, he's got the smart look down. The glasses, the furrowed brow, the ticky walk."
"RORY: The Kierkergaard."
"LORELAI: I really think it's the walk."
"RORY: Well, we are at Yale, you know. There are smart people here."
"LORELAI: I know there are smart people here. I just didn't realize how many. I bet if I pulled my checkbook out now, twelve guys could help me balance it."
"RICHARD: Thirteen if you were near the right building."
"RORY: Grandpa, that art gallery was amazing. Thank you."
"RICHARD: Yale has one of the finest collections of British art in the world."
"LORELAI: Louvre, schmouvre."
"RICHARD: Oh, I spent a lot of time in that gallery as a young man."
"EMILY: I'll say you did."
"LORELAI: What was that I'll say you did'?"
"EMILY: I just remember that that gallery was one of your father's favorite places to bring the ladies."
"RORY: What?"
"RICHARD: Emily."
"EMILY: It's where you took me on our first date."
"LORELAI: So, Dad liked to impress them with the paintings."
"RICHARD: Why did you bring this up?"
"EMILY: He was a master of the frown, step back, wrinkle and sigh."
"LORELAI: The what?"
"EMILY: Frown. Step back. Wrinkle. And sigh."
"RICHARD: I did no such thing."
"EMILY: And then he'd talk about the paintings he had seen in Paris and the colors of Titian, and by the end of the date, you thought he was the most brilliant man in the entire world."
"LORELAI: Using Titian to score. Even Titian didn't do that."
"RICHARD: You shouldn't tell them this. They'll think I was some kind of lothario."
"EMILY: Well, you were."
"RICHARD: I was just a young single man who wanted to experience life."
"LORELAI: Don't ever fall for that line."
"RORY: I promise."
"RICHARD: You know, Emily, you weren't such an innocent little doe lost in the woods yourself."
"EMILY: I beg your pardon?"
"LORELAI: They're turning on each other, I love it."
"RICHARD: I'll have you know, I was happily involved in a very serious relationship when your mother decided she simply had to have me."
"EMILY: Oh, the size of your ego, I swear."
"RICHARD: Linny Lott."
"EMILY: That mouse?"
"RICHARD: Oh, that mouse and I were engaged."
"EMILY: Oh, you were not."
"RICHARD: I'd given her my pin, I'd introduced her to my parents."
"EMILY: So?"
"RICHARD: The date was set, invitations mailed out."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Well, you couldn't marry Linny Lott. That woman needed directions to get to a point."
"LORELAI: Rawr!"
"EMILY: Richard Gilmore, you are going to give these girls the wrong impression."
"RORY: What impression is that, Grandma?"
"LORELAI: That you were the Helena Bonham Carter of the society set?"
"EMILY: I did not steal your grandfather, I simply gave him a choice."
"RICHARD: When you showed up at my fraternity party in that blue dress, I had no choice."
"LORELAI: You stole my father with fashion."
"EMILY: I can't believe you remember the dress."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you were the other woman."
"EMILY: Oh, this is ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Another woman should be saying this is ridiculous."
"EMILY: Will you stop?"
"[they stop next to a trash can]"
"RICHARD: Well. . ."
"EMILY: Well what?"
"RICHARD: You mean you don't remember?"
"EMILY: Oh my God! There was a bench here."
"RICHARD: They moved it last year."
"EMILY: I can't believe this."
"LORELAI: Me either. What if we wanted to sit down?"
"EMILY: This is where your father proposed?"
"RORY: Really?"
"RICHARD: That's right."
"LORELAI: By the trash can."
"EMILY: That's right."
"LORELAI: Well, that's very romantic. . .especially if you need to spit your gum out."
"EMILY: We were going to meet my girlfriends who were going to drive me back to school."
"RICHARD: And you were angry with me."
"EMILY: Because you wouldn't commit to plans for the holidays."
"RICHARD: Because I was going to invite you to the house to meet my parents after I proposed."
"EMILY: Which I didn't know because you gave me no indication whatsoever."
"RICHARD: Anyway, you had just finished calling me a spineless jellyfish."
"EMILY: And you got very annoyed, reached in your pocket, pulled out a box and said, ""Here."""
"RICHARD: And you opened the box, showed no emotion, slammed it close and said, ""Fine."""
"EMILY: Yes, I did."
"[they kiss over the trash can]"
"RORY: That's so sweet."
"EMILY: Oh no, my button broke."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah? Let me see."
"EMILY: It just broke in two and fell."
"LORELAI: Well, let me look, Mom."
"EMILY: It's a broken button, what is there to look at?"
"LORELAI: All right, then, I think there's a bathroom over there."
"EMILY: What can we do in a bathroom?"
"LORELAI: Meet George Michael."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"[cut to inside the bathroom]"
"EMILY: I don't believe it. This is a brand new skirt."
"LORELAI: Mom, let me see."
"EMILY: I have this dinner to go tonight. What am I going to do?"
"LORELAI: Drink a lot. It's easier to explain not wearing a skirt if you're falling down drunk."
"EMILY: Thank you for the advice."
"LORELAI: You know, I can rig this til you get home."
"EMILY: You can?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, just give me five seconds here."
"[pulls something out of her purse]"
"EMILY: What is that?"
"LORELAI: It's a paper clip."
"EMILY: And what do you intend to do with that paper clip?"
"LORELAI: I intend to carve something really dirty into the bathroom door."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What rhymes with Nantucket?"
"EMILY: I'm standing here holding my skirt."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna put this paper clip through the buttonhole and then through the thread that used to hold the button, and then you're gonna put your jacket back on and there you go."
"EMILY: That's ingenious."
"LORELAI: I know. If I had a thumbtack, I could make a scud m*ssile."
"EMILY: You know, your father's having a wonderful time."
"LORELAI: Well, good."
"EMILY: It means a lot to him to share this with Rory."
"LORELAI: I know."
"EMILY: Actually, it means a lot to him to share this with you and Rory. It's very nice that you're here."
"LORELAI: Nice for you. I just found out you're not supposed to be my real mother, so I'm a little scarred."
""
""
""
"[cut to Richard and Rory outside]"
"RICHARD: See that? That is my favorite building in the whole school."
"RORY: It is?"
"RICHARD: Yes, it is."
"RORY: Why?"
"RICHARD: Because that's where the Timothy Dwight Dining Hall is."
"RORY: I thought campus food was supposed to be disgusting."
"RICHARD: Not Yale food. They have the most delicious pot roast you've ever tasted."
"RORY: I love pot roast."
"RICHARD: Who doesn't love pot roast? Are you having a good time?"
"RORY: I'm having a very good time."
"RICHARD: I'm glad. It's nice being able to show this place to another Gilmore generation. You know, one day, when your mother was ten years old, she ran into my office and she said, ""I'm going to go to Yale, just like you."" She actually took my diploma out of my office and put it in her room. She wouldn't give it back to me for about six months. This place makes you remember things. Hopefully, things you're being graded on."
"[Emily and Lorelai walk over]"
"EMILY: All right, we're all in one piece again."
"RICHARD: Oh, glad to hear it. Shall we continue?"
"LORELAI: Okay, but you're not gonna show me the vending machine where I was conceived, are you? Cause I don't think I can take it."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE YALE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING"
"[The four of them are walking through a large building]"
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Lions and tigers and bears. . ."
"RORY: Oh my."
"RICHARD: It's impressive, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'd like to open a checking account, please."
"RORY: What is this place?"
"RICHARD: This is the main administration building. Professors' offices, the dean's office. Some of the best scotch in the country can be found behind those doors."
"LORELAI: Not sure how to take that, Dad."
"RICHARD: Come on. Ah, follow me, please."
"LORELAI: What's he so excited about?"
"EMILY: Oh, who knows? Dickens must have dropped a pencil here at some point."
"RICHARD: Rory, this is the office of a very dear friend of mine. His name is Harris Fellows, and he just happens to be the Dean of Admissions."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RICHARD: That's right. And I called him just before we came down and I asked him if he had a little time to squeeze you in and he said yes."
"RORY: Squeeze me in?"
"RICHARD: For an interview."
"LORELAI: An interview for what, Dad?"
"RICHARD: An interview for Yale."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Oh, I told him all about you and your grades and how well you were doing at Chilton. Well, of course, he insisted on seeing you. He wouldn't let me off the hook."
"RORY: But I haven't applied to Yale."
"RICHARD: Oh, I told him that you weren't finished deciding, that you were being very picky. I think that made him want you even more. They can be very competitive, these Ivy League schools. He's expecting you at three. Oh, look, it's three now. Well, we timed this perfectly now, didn't we? Come on, I'll walk you in. Uh, we'll be right back."
"LORELAI: Rory, honey, you don't have to go in there."
"RICHARD: What? Well, of course she's going to go in there."
"LORELAI: Rory, honey, the only person I'm talking to, you don't have to go in there if you don't want to."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, the man is waiting."
"LORELAI: You wanna leave? Cause we could just leave."
"RORY: No, it's okay. I'll go in."
"RICHARD: Harris is a very nice man, Rory. I think you two are really going to hit it off. Come on, I'll walk you in."
"[Richard and Rory walk into the office while Lorelai and Emily wait in the hall]"
"EMILY: My skirt seems to be holding up very well. Lorelai "
"LORELAI: No."
"[Richard walks out of the office]"
"RICHARD: She shook his hand. She just reached out and shook his hand. It completely threw him off. I swear, that girl."
"LORELAI: You know what, I almost feel like a standing ovation is in order."
"RICHARD: If you're going to get dramatic, let's go outside. It echoes in here."
"LORELAI: What did you think you were doing?"
"RICHARD: I thought I was helping my granddaughter get into what is, in my opinion, the best Ivy League school in America."
"LORELAI: Even though she doesn't wanna go here?"
"RICHARD: She doesn't know she doesn't want to go here."
"LORELAI: You're unbelievable, Dad. You corner her alone the other night, without me there."
"RICHARD: Of course I did. You wouldn't let her go."
"LORELAI: Oh, I wouldn't?"
"RICHARD: I knew that the last thing in the world that you could want would be for Rory to go to Yale."
"LORELAI: And the reason for that would be?"
"RICHARD: I went to Yale, therefore Rory can't."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's right, the crazy reason."
"RICHARD: That's all right. It's your prerogative to feel that way. It's mine to make sure that Rory at least knows all her options."
"LORELAI: Aren't you supposed to slap my face with a glove before you do this?"
"RICHARD: I'm not going to discuss this with you."
"LORELAI: Well, you lied to everybody, Dad. You lied to me, you lied to Rory, I'm looking at Mom and I'm thinking you lied to her, too."
"EMILY: Lorelai, please, let's try and calm down."
"RICHARD: This is for Rory's own good."
"LORELAI: Rory's going to Harvard."
"RICHARD: We'll see."
"LORELAI: No, Rory's going to Harvard. It's already been decided without you, get it? You don't control it. And that little stunt of yours doesn't change that fact one bit."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry about the way it had to be done, but I didn't want to argue with you about it."
"LORELAI: My whole life, you have tried to control everything, and if you didn't get to control something, then you just didn't deal with it."
"RICHARD: That's ridiculous."
"LORELAI: When you couldn't control me, you didn't deal with me."
"RICHARD: This has nothing to do with you."
"LORELAI: No?"
"RICHARD: This is about Rory and Rory's education. Which, frankly Lorelai, is something you know nothing about."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RICHARD: You never went to college, let alone an Ivy League college. You don't know the first thing about the system, the way it works. I do, I went through it. You want Rory to go to Harvard that badly? Well, so do thousands of other mothers. Yale is an excellent school, the equal of Harvard in every way except one  I went here. I'm an alumnus. That makes it easier for Rory to get in. And if you had any idea about the way the system works, you'd know this."
"LORELAI: Oh, so, here it is. I knew we would eventually get to the big ""my daughter's a loser, poor me, the future squandered, the Gilmore name's sullied"" speech."
"RICHARD: I am not going to leave Rory's education to chance simply because I might risk offending you. Her future is more important than your pride. If you don't like that, I'm sorry. If it makes you angry, well, what else is new? But that, my dear girl, is the way it is."
"LORELAI: I'm calling a cab. We're leaving."
"[Lorelai walks out of the building, Emily follows her]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, come back inside. Lorelai, put the phone away and come back inside."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Yes, hi, in New Haven, I need a number of a cab company. Um, anyone, pick one. Thanks."
"EMILY: You are not going to take a cab all the way back to Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: He lied to you, too, Mom. Don't you care about that?"
"EMILY: That is between me and your father."
"LORELAI: Great, whatever. Damn, I just forgot the number."
"EMILY: If you would just calm down and look at it from his point of view."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hi, um, uh, in New Haven, I need a cab company, any cab company."
"EMILY: Your father is a very strong-willed man, Lorelai. You know this, you take after him."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Thank you."
"EMILY: He wants the best for Rory. He thinks this is the best."
"LORELAI: It doesn't really matter what he thinks. It matters what I think and what Rory thinks and the list ends there."
"EMILY: So Rory takes a meeting at Yale. That doesn't mean she still won't go to Harvard."
"LORELAI: I know it doesn't, because she is still going to Harvard."
"EMILY: If she applies to Yale "
"LORELAI: She's not applying to Yale!"
"EMILY: And gets into Yale, that might even make her more appealing to Harvard. Have you thought about that?"
"LORELAI: No, I haven't, because I'm not trying to reason away a crazy man's actions."
"EMILY: Oh, don't do this. Don't turn this into yet another one of your crusades against your childhood. Just let it go. Realize that despite the matter in which your father did this, his intentions were honorable."
"LORELAI: You know what, Mom? Sometimes I literally sit around and try to figure out why Dad and I have such an awful relationship. I try to figure out why we can't communicate and why we can't seem to break through whatever crap it is that stands between us, and then something like this happens and suddenly it's like, Oh yeah. That's why.'"
"EMILY: Fine, Lorelai, your father's a demon. He's cruel and out to destroy your happiness. But think about this  you're fighting so hard to send Rory off to Harvard no matter what that you haven't even stopped for one second to consider that if she went to Yale, she could live at home. Consider that on your cab ride."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hi, yes, in New Haven, I need a cab company."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING"
"[Rory and the Dean of Admissions walk out of the office]"
"HARRIS: It was a pleasure to meet you. I'll read that book you recommended."
"RORY: And don't be fooled by the Oprah seal on the cover, it's actually very good."
"RICHARD: Well, how did it go? I see that everyone is smiling."
"HARRIS: Richard, your granddaughter is everything you said and more. You should be very proud."
"RICHARD: I am, very proud."
"HARRIS: It was very nice meeting you."
"RORY: Same here."
"HARRIS: I'll see you at dinner later, Richard."
"RICHARD: Thanks, Harris."
"[Harris walks away]"
"RICHARD: Well, that  that sounded like it went very well. Uh, what did you tell him to read?"
"RORY: Why did you do that?"
"RICHARD: Do what?"
"RORY: Why did you make this appointment without telling me about it?"
"RICHARD: Rory, I know this appointment upset your mother, but this was an important opportunity."
"RORY: I know it was an important opportunity. That's why I can't believe you didn't prepare me for it. I didn't have my transcripts, my letters of recommendation. I couldn't even remember what I wanted to major in when he asked."
"RICHARD: I'm sure he knew you were nervous."
"RORY: But I didn't have to be that nervous. I could've been calm. I could've brushed my hair. I never would've worn this."
"RICHARD: Oh, Rory, none of this matters."
"RORY: It matters to me. I like to be prepared. This has nothing to do with Mom. If you had really wanted me to take this meeting, I would've done it just because you asked me to. And I would've done it right."
"[Lorelai and Emily walk back into the building]"
"LORELAI: Rory, a cab is meeting us at the main gate. Let's go."
"RORY: I'm coming. Bye Grandma."
"EMILY: Goodbye Rory."
"[Lorelai and Rory leave]"
"EMILY: [to Richard] Don't you even look at me."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory get out of a cab and start walking down the sidewalk]"
"LORELAI: Thanks. Uh, well, here's the good news. You no longer have to worry about which college to go to cause that cab ride was your college tuition."
"RORY: Can we not say the word college for at least forty-eight hours?"
"LORELAI: Fine."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: How bout collage, can we say collage? Cause it sounds the same but it's actually very different."
"RORY: Collage is fine."
"LORELAI: Okay, good, cause I don't even know how to get through a conversation without the word collage."
"RORY: I should've listened to you about today."
"LORELAI: Oh, no. There's no way even I could've seen this one coming."
"[they walk into the diner]"
"RORY: I can't believe I had a meeting at Yale today."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: And I can't believe the only name that popped into my head when he asked for my role model was Gloria Estefan."
"LORELAI: Well, you don't work great under pressure."
"RORY: Sucky day."
"LORELAI: But excellent tacos."
"RORY: Yeah, Hector really came through."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: We're coming from a day with my parents. Want a taco?"
"LUKE: Uh, no thanks. See, I already have food here. We sell it to the other customers who don't come quite as prepared as the two of you."
"LORELAI: Mm, be nice and get us some salsa."
"LUKE: At least order a cup of coffee."
"RORY: Coffee and tacos?"
"LORELAI: Sounds just gross enough to work."
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Hi."
"LUKE: Please, I'll finish it  hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. I'm getting the coffee."
"JESS: I gotta run out for a second and get a part for my car."
"LUKE: Get a receipt this time."
"JESS: I'll be back. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Hey Luke, what's the record for most tacos eaten in a diner that doesn't actually sell tacos?"
"LUKE: I have no idea."
"LORELAI: Find out, will you, cause if it's less than five, we're famous."
"LUKE: Where'd you get those things anyhow?"
"LORELAI: New Haven."
"LUKE: Really? That dump was close?"
"LORELAI: We paid a little visit to Yale today."
"RORY: Yes, one that I would prefer not to relive, thank you very much. I'm gonna go study."
"LORELAI: Okay hon, see you back home."
"RORY: Bye Luke."
"LUKE: Bye."
"[Rory leaves; Luke sits down with Lorelai]"
"LUKE: Uh, listen, I just want you to know that I had a little talk with Jess earlier."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"LUKE: Yes, I did, and I really laid down the rules concerning him and Rory. Trust me, he now knows that I am going to be watching them every second they are together."
"LORELAI: Oh good."
"LUKE: Yup."
"LORELAI: You know, they're together now."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. I have to get a part for my car', I'm going to go study'  that's kid code for Meet me at the previously agreed upon location far away from my clueless uncle.'"
"LUKE: You're kidding me, right? You don't really think that. . .damn, they are! They're together. They used the kid code and now they're together!"
"LORELAI: It's okay, Luke."
"LUKE: It's okay, Luke? They are out there right now doing God knows what, completely unsupervised. How did you let this happen?"
"LORELAI: Me?"
"LUKE: Yes, you. I thought you were against this."
"LORELAI: I thought you were all, This is so great and Rory's gonna change Jess.'"
"LUKE: What is she, a miracle worker? Come on, Lorelai, wake up  the guy's trouble. I have to find them. Caesar, I'll be back in a little while."
"LORELAI: You're seriously gonna run all over town looking for Jess and Rory?"
"LUKE: If I have to, yes. And if you were really a concerned mother, you'd go out there with me."
"LORELAI: No, I can't do that. But if you like, I'll let you sniff Rory's sweater. Maybe her scent will help you track them down."
"LUKE: The things you find amusing astound me sometimes."
"[Luke grabs Rory's sweater from the chair]"
"LORELAI: You're not really gonna sniff it."
"LUKE: No, it's cold out. She might need it."
"CUT TO GAS STATION"
"[Jess stands next to a gas pump holding an unlit cigarette as Rory walks up to him]"
"RORY: You going to smoke that or mind meld with it?"
"JESS: It depends."
"RORY: So where's the part for your car?"
"JESS: Huh, I don't know. Gypsy said she was gonna leave it for me somewhere. Guess she forgot."
"RORY: She's bad that way."
"JESS: I'm just gonna have to take my business elsewhere."
"RORY: Looks that way."
"JESS: So."
"RORY: So."
"JESS: Here we are."
"RORY: Yeah, here we are. So, tell me, what's your decision about smoking that depending on?"
"JESS: On what's gonna happen."
"RORY: When?"
"JESS: Now."
"[They kiss]"
"RORY: I'm glad you didn't smoke it."
"JESS: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"[they kiss again]"
"JESS: Well, whatever else happens between us, at least we know that part works. What?"
"RORY: I have to go."
"JESS: What? Did I do something or "
"RORY: No, no. This was. . . you were  are. . .it was wonderful, and I look forward to many similar occurrences in the future, but right now, I have to go. Understand?"
"JESS: Not at all."
"RORY: It's more fun that way, isn't it?"
"JESS: Come here. [kisses her] b*at it."
"RORY: I'll see you tomorrow."
"CUT TO DEAN'S HOUSE"
"[Rory knocks on Dean's bedroom window, he opens it]"
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: What are you doing?"
"RORY: I climbed a tree."
"DEAN: Why?"
"RORY: Well, I was afraid to ring the doorbell cause your mom would answer and I assume she knows, so I assume she hates me and I just wanted to talk to you, so. . ."
"DEAN: She doesn't know."
"RORY: She doesn't."
"DEAN: I haven't really been in the mood to talk about it."
"RORY: But you're going to have to tell her eventually, so if she did answer the door and was nice to me, then I would've known that she was going to be hating me soon, and that just would've been really hard because I like your mom. I guess you're probably gonna tell your sister also, so she's probably gonna hate me, too."
"DEAN: Well, too bad, Rory. Somebody doesn't like you for once."
"RORY: I didn't mean "
"DEAN: What do you want?"
"RORY: Do you remember that girl Butterfly who lived in a tree for a year? I can officially attest that she was nuts."
"DEAN: I have to go."
"RORY: I wanna say that I'm sorry."
"DEAN: For what?"
"RORY: For treating you the way I did. For doing all the things you said I did. I am so, so sorry. It's all my fault. I don't know what's wrong with me. You were the most amazing boyfriend in the world. You made me so happy. You made me laugh, you made my mother like you, you were nice to my friends, you protected me, you even came with me to that stupid debutante ball."
"DEAN: I don't need the list."
"RORY: I really did love you. Please believe that."
"DEAN: You with him now?"
"RORY: I don't wanna talk about him. I just came to tell you that I'm truly sorry that I hurt you, and that I'm going to miss you so much, and I just hope that someday you won't hate me anymore."
"DEAN: I hope so, too."
"[Dean closes the window]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is studying on the couch as Lorelai walks into the room with two mugs]"
"LORELAI: Coffee and Ovaltine."
"RORY: Thanks."
"LORELAI: It's getting late, you almost done?"
"RORY: Almost."
"LORELAI: Don't study so much that you get brilliant, go mad, grow a big bald egghead and try to take over the world, okay, cause I wanna go shoe shopping this weekend."
"RORY: Promise, I will not go mad until we get you some boots."
"LORELAI: Thank you. [starts to walk upstairs, then turns around] Hey."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: How was the rest of the evening?"
"RORY: It was eventful."
"LORELAI: Eventful. . . well, okay. Goodnight hon. [starts to go upstairs]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: [turns around] Yeah?"
"RORY: Details tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Ah, thank God. Cause you know what not knowing these things does to me."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: I can't sleep. I wonder what I did wrong. Should I not have left you that first day in kindergarten when you begged me not to? Are you holding it against me?"
"RORY: I was fine staying at kindergarten. You were the one that had trouble leaving."
"LORELAI: See, see how irrational I get when you hold out on me? I invent crazy reasons why you hold out on me."
"RORY: Night Mom."
"LORELAI: Night babe. [goes upstairs]"
"[Later that night, Rory walks into her bedroom, turns out the light and tries to go to sleep. A moment later, she turns the light back on, grabs her Yale brochure from her night table and starts reading it. Upstairs, Lorelai is reading the same brochure in her bedroom.]"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are on the couch watching television]"
"RORY: I like these women."
"LORELAI: I love these women."
"RORY: Poor Edie."
"LORELAI: Which Edie?"
"RORY: Little Edie. She's just trying to sing and her mom won't stop talking."
"LORELAI: Big Edie was so beautiful in her day."
"RORY: They were both pretty."
"LORELAI: I can't believe they were related to Jackie."
"RORY: Well, the Kennedy's kind of hid them in the background for many years."
"LORELAI: Well, when you're a Kennedy, how do you even choose who in the family to hide?"
"RORY: It's a tough choice."
"LORELAI: Something beautiful about them though. They're cool, they're free."
"RORY: Yeah, and they're memorable. Most people are very forgettable. And they're happy."
"LORELAI: They had their cats."
"RORY: And their raccoons."
"LORELAI: And their pretty house."
"RORY: And each other."
"LORELAI: Add a few years and they're us."
"RORY: Yeah. . .yeah."
"LORELAI: Yeah."

"CUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie rushes around giving instructions]"
"SOOKIE: Rhiana, run it through the sieve again, I want it smooth as glass. Don't cut corners, people!"
"LORELAI: Is she melting down?"
"MICHEL: Like butter on a k*ll."
"LORELAI: Sookie. . ."
"SOOKIE: Just a sec, hon. How's your love life, Pete? A little frustrated, I bet. Wondering how I know that? Cause you're taking it out on my egg whites. Gently, fold them gently. Cheryl  you're slicing not dicing, I can hear it in the chop. Adjust, my friend."
"LORELAI: Sookie, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, let's talk."
"SOOKIE: I'm extremely lacking in time here."
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"SOOKIE: Uh, chaos? Uh, a travesty of cooking? It's a salmonella laboratory in here!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, the kitchen will be in good hands."
"SOOKIE: But not in my hands."
"LORELAI: It'll be in Bob hands. Bob has great hands."
"SOOKIE: No, you know what Bob has? Bob has two seconds to get the hollandaise off the flame before I break his neck!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, listen, you hired Bob. You trained him in your image. He's great, and he's subbed for you before."
"SOOKIE: But this is Thanksgiving, he has never done Thanksgiving."
"LORELAI: He's ready, he'll sub for you seamlessly. Even Big Joe Newsanchor's have substitutes."
"SOOKIE: And that's the thing. They still say, And now the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather.' You see? Dan is still associated with it even though he's off snorkeling or something, just like I'm gonna be associated with the dinner because Bob is substituting for Sookie. Excuse me one minute."
"[Sookie starts rummaging through the trash can]"
"MICHEL: Oh, this can only be good."
"LORELAI: Sookie, that's the garbage. Stop rooting through the garbage."
"SOOKIE: I will when people stop throwing away useful stuff!"
"LORELAI: Drop, drop the, drop the tops, drop them, drop them. Come here, come here, come here. Now, Sookie, listen to me because you're torturing yourself here."
"[Emily walks in and stands behind Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: Emily, hi."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's nice. That's very high school. Stick with me here."
"SOOKIE: Good to see you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, ah, that's funny. You know who's behind you? It's Joseph Stalin, my good friend. What are you doing back from the dead, Joe?"
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom! Ah, geez, you scared me."
"EMILY: You heard Sookie greet me."
"LORELAI: Oh, I thought it was a joke."
"EMILY: Like comparing me to Joseph Stalin?"
"LORELAI: I wasn't comparing you to Joseph Stalin."
"EMILY: I'm in a hurry. Can we speak for a minute?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I guess, for a minute. So, were you in the area or something?"
"EMILY: Not really."
"LORELAI: Then what are you doing here?"
"EMILY: I wanted to talk to you."
"LORELAI: Phone's out of order?"
"EMILY: Let's not play games here."
"LORELAI: Games?"
"EMILY: I've called several times the past few weeks and you've k*ll avoided every call."
"LORELAI: No, that's not true. I've left messages on your machine."
"EMILY: Yes, messages. And then if I happened to pick up, you'd hang up. Or if the maid picked up, you'd ask for me, then claim you were driving through a tunnel so you might get cut off, and then you'd make garbling noises and hang up."
"LORELAI: Fine, Mom, we're talking now. What's up?"
"EMILY: Are you feeling well?"
"LORELAI: You came all the way out here to ask me that?"
"EMILY: Well, you've been sick these past few Friday's for dinner, so I was concerned. That's why you didn't come, right, because you were sick? So are you better? You look fine."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's the makeup. I'm still. . .uh, these allergies really just hit me like a ton of bricks."
"EMILY: I've never heard you mention allergies before."
"LORELAI: I'm a silent sufferer."
"EMILY: Well, I certainly hope you're feeling better now because I want you to come to dinner tomorrow night."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving."
"EMILY: Yes, it is Thanksgiving. And before you sift through the dozen or so excuses you always have on hand, let me have my say. You've missed two dinners and avoided my calls because you're mad at us about what happened at Yale. But I want you and Rory at Thanksgiving this year."
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: If you have plans "
"LORELAI: We do have plans."
"EMILY: Alter them. Now, there'll be other people there, so the focus won't be on you, and you may even be able to get by without saying more than hello', goodbye', and pass the gravy'."
"LORELAI: We already have plans."
"EMILY: Your father and I are going out of town the next day and we'll be gone all of December, including Christmas, so it's the last chance for the family to be together for the rest of the year."
"LORELAI: Look "
"EMILY: And I want you to remember that I am not the one who set the meeting for Rory behind your back. I want you there, Lorelai. And if you're still sick, I don't want a doctor's note. I want your doctor himself to come to my house and convince me that it's true, got it?"
"LORELAI: Got it."
"EMILY: See you tomorrow."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"TEACHER: The multi-layered membrane systems of the cytoplasm are the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the golgi body. Now, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is concerned with the manufacture of lipid molecules. [bell rings] We'll continue on this next week. Keep up on your reading please."
"MADELINE: That was really distracting."
"PARIS: Oh. Well, by all means, Madeline, you should point out to the faculty that their annoying custom of teaching is distracting you from more important things like nail filing and daydreaming about marrying Ryan Phillippe."
"LOUISE: Uh, he's already married."
"PARIS: Then whatever strawhead actor isn't."
"MADELINE: This was bad. For the last five minutes, every single thing she said sounded dirty."
"LOUISE: Yeah, same here."
"PARIS: Good God."
"MADELINE: I mean, reticulum? Come on."
"LOUISE: Plus, the golgi body. I mean, is it me or is that majorly pornographic?"
"PARIS: My life with the Banger sisters."
"RORY: So, changing the subject. . ."
"PARIS: Hallelujah."
"RORY: What's everybody doing for Thanksgiving?"
"PARIS: I can't even talk about Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Louise?"
"LOUISE: Im having dinner with my dad."
"MADELINE: Isn't he still in jail?"
"LOUISE: Yes, but his company donated some treadmills for the inmates so he swung a special trailer for dinner that they're gonna set up for us in the parking lot. We have it for about two hours and then one of the Manson girls gets us."
"MADELINE: You're lucky it's in that order."
"PARIS: My Thanksgiving is turning into a Wes Craven movie."
"RORY: How so?"
"PARIS: I called shelters to volunteer to serve food. It's Thanksgiving  you'd think they have needs. Nope. Every stupid soup kitchen in town turned me down because they have enough volunteers."
"MADELINE: Bummer."
"PARIS: I'm on a couple waiting lists, but it doesn't look good."
"RORY: I've never heard of too many volunteers."
"PARIS: Who are all these jackasses who volunteered anyway? They can't all be students like me. They're not all putting it on a college application. I get something out of it and these other people don't get a thing. Talk about selfish."
"LOUISE: Sore subject."
"RORY: What are you up to, Madeline?"
"MADELINE: I've got more college applications to fill out. Backups, safety schools."
"LOUISE: I've got some of that, too. I'm so behind."
"PARIS: I told you guys to have those things done by now."
"LOUISE: Sorry, Mom."
"PARIS: It's not about being sorry. It's about being prepared. I got Harvard and my backups in weeks ago."
"MADELINE: Okay, all you're doing is making me more nervous. I'll see you guys Monday."
"LOUISE: Same here."
"RORY: Yup, see you guys Monday."
"PARIS: Harvard is going to be expecting Thanksgiving shelter work. They'll know I called too late and it will totally impugn my organizational k*ll. By the way, you know I ultimately do all these things for the good of mankind, right?"
"RORY: Oh yeah."
"PARIS: Sometimes I don't think I come off that way."
"RORY: No."
"[Paris' cell phone rings]"
"PARIS: [answers phone] Hello? . . . Yes, thanks for returning my call. . . nothing? But wait, wait, wait  just stick me at any old pot. I'm small, you won't even know I'm there, I'll even bring my own ladle. . . .Oh, now, come on, work with me here. I've got a slotted spoon. . . Well, what about coffee or condiments? You got condiments covered? . . . I'm sorry, can I speak to your supervisor? . . . My attitude? What about your attitude? I'm trying to help people. It's Thanksgiving. . ."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: So she coldcocked you, huh?"
"LORELAI: She bit me, incapacitated me with her poison, and devoured me whole."
"RORY: But how are we going to go to four Thanksgiving dinners?"
"LORELAI: It's not four, is it?"
"RORY: Lane's house, Sookie's, and we always stop by Luke's. . .that's three, and Grandma and Grandpa is four."
"LORELAI: Ah, we're mad, Edie."
"RORY: We're us, Edie."
"LORELAI: Well, we've gotta go to my parents' or we'll be brought up on w*r crimes. Lane's is always super early, so that's easy to catch. Sookie's is mid afternoon."
"RORY: Luke's the toughie."
"LORELAI: Guess that's the one we'll have to skip."
"RORY: Bummer."
"LORELAI: I know, but he won't care. Holidays are nothing to him anyway."
"[Kirk walks out of The Chat Club with several bags]"
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk. Discover a new freaky fetish?"
"KIRK: What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. You buy a cat?"
"KIRK: Yup. I'm very excited."
"LORELAI: You seem it. So what's all this?"
"RORY: I'm assuming there's nothing left in the store."
"KIRK: Actually, there are a number of things left."
"RORY: No, I meant you seem to be buying a lot of stuff."
"KIRK: Oh, sorry. My excitement must be clouding my ability to judge comedic hyperbole."
"LORELAI: So where'd you get the cat?"
"KIRK: A lady had a bunch of them at the grocery store and Kirk seemed to take an instant liking to me."
"LORELAI: Kirk?"
"KIRK: Yes?"
"LORELAI: No, I mean, the cat's name is Kirk?"
"KIRK: Yup."
"LORELAI: Weird coincidence or. . ."
"KIRK: I named him Kirk."
"LORELAI: Isn't that confusing?"
"KIRK: Not when you think about it."
"[Lorelai thinks about it]"
"LORELAI: No, it's still confusing."
"KIRK: I like the name, and whenever I call Kirk's name, I obviously won't be calling myself."
"LORELAI: True."
"KIRK: Although when my mom calls for Kirk, that may be confusing. Maybe I can get her to say CatKirk when she's calling Kirk, and HumanKirk when she's calling me."
"RORY: That would keep it straight."
"KIRK: I'm glad I ran into you. See ya."
"LORELAI: See ya, HumanKirk."
"RORY: Bye HumanKirk."
"[Kirk walks away]"
"RORY: He's always been a cat person, he's just never had a cat."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Anywhere?"
"LUKE: Anywhere."
"LORELAI: [to customer at table] Hm, would you mind moving?"
"LUKE: I hate when you do that."
"LORELAI: It's my showstopper."
"LUKE: An empty table."
"LORELAI: Ah. You ready to order?"
"RORY: I'm ready."
"LUKE: Don't bother, saw you coming, already ordered your Wednesday usual  the French dip, extra fries, the every-Wednesday cherry pie."
"RORY: Such service."
"LORELAI: Oh, and such a food rut we're in."
"RORY: Thank you, Luke."
"LUKE: I gotta get back to stuffing my turkey."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, do you have time to do that and prep your Thanksgiving food?"
"LUKE: Stop it."
"RORY: Here, here."
"LUKE: It's a tedious job."
"LORELAI: Well, what if we told you you could stuff one less?"
"LUKE: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: We got jammed. Shanghaied by my mother and what with the other things we have going. . .well, too many commitments, not enough us."
"LUKE: So?"
"RORY: We can't make it tomorrow."
"LUKE: Oh, okay, fine."
"LORELAI: It was beyond our control."
"LUKE: That's fine, whatever. I'll be right back. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Um, okay, I may be crazy, but he almost looked. . . ."
"RORY: Disappointed."
"LORELAI: Yes, disappointed. We disappointed Luke."
"RORY: I didn't think it was possible."
"LORELAI: Our powers are greater than we know."
"RORY: He actually likes it when we come for Thanksgiving. All these years and we never knew."
"LORELAI: Hm, he's the Grinch and we're Cindy Lou Who."
"RORY: So Cindy Lou, what do we do?"
"LORELAI: I got it."
"[Lorelai picks up her cell phone as Luke walks over]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Oh, uh, perfect. That works great. Okay, bye now. [hangs up] Sorry, I'm just clarifying the schedule for tomorrow. As luck has it, we can make it. We'll definitely be here."
"LUKE: It's okay."
"LORELAI: No, it's all cleared. That was my mom, and, uh, the time's just gonna work out just fine."
"LUKE: Really, you don't have to. I already stopped prepping the last turkey."
"LORELAI: Well, start prepping it again cause we are coming."
"LUKE: I don't want you to feel like you have to come."
"LORELAI: This is tiring."
"RORY: I can kneel behind him and you can push him over."
"LORELAI: It may come to that."
"LUKE: It won't be a hassle?"
"LORELAI: It won't be a hassle."
"LUKE: You sure?"
"LORELAI: We're coming, now go away and let us eat. Shoo, shoo."
"[Luke walks away]"
"RORY: That was very nice."
"LORELAI: Well, I hate disappointing people."
"RORY: Okay, now, practical question. . . how are we going to eat four Thanksgiving dinners?"
"LORELAI: How? Rory, what are we if not world champion eaters?"
"RORY: It's too much food."
"LORELAI: It's not too much food. This is what we've been training for our whole lives. This is our destiny. This is our finest hour."
"RORY: Or final hour."
"LORELAI: No, no. Get inspired and tomorrow I guarantee you, we will be standing on the Olympic platform receiving our gold medals for eating. We are not Michelle Kwan-ing this."
"RORY: Okay, okay, four dinners."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we'll skip the rolls."
"RORY: That'll help. You know, we might wanna consider not eating much now in preparation for our finest hour. A little fasting so that we can enjoy more tomorrow, hm?"
"LORELAI: Unnecessary."
"RORY: Yeah."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[On Thanksgiving morning, Lorelai and Rory are walking toward the market]"
"RORY: What's on the list?"
"LORELAI: Flowers for everyone we're visiting and cranberry sauce for the Kims."
"RORY: Tums."
"LORELAI: You mean amateur pills?"
"RORY: Just in case."
"LORELAI: Okay, Tums."
"RORY: I'll do the flowers."
"LORELAI: I'll do Doose's."
"RORY: Thank you."
"[Lorelai goes into the market. Jess walks up behind Rory]"
"JESS: Hey there."
"RORY: Hey. [he kisses her, but Rory pulls away] Wait, stop."
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: Stop."
"JESS: What are you doing?"
"RORY: Come on. [Rory pulls him down the sidewalk a little, then kisses him]"
"JESS: What was that?"
"RORY: That was a kiss."
"JESS: What's with the relocation before the kiss?"
"RORY: It's too early."
"JESS: Too early? Too early for what?"
"RORY: For kissing like that."
"JESS: What's the rule, no kissing before noon?"
"RORY: No, it's too early to do this here."
"JESS: Where, in the street?"
"RORY: In the street, with people watching..."
"JESS: What people?"
"RORY: In front of Doose's."
"JESS: Ah, Doose's."
"RORY: We shouldn't flaunt it."
"JESS: But I want to flaunt it."
"RORY: It doesn't feel right."
"JESS: He's a big boy Rory."
"RORY: I know."
"JESS: It's not the first time a couple's broken up."
"RORY: It is for us."
"JESS: This is insane."
"RORY: Please, let's not flaunt it, please?"
"JESS: For how long?"
"RORY: Until it's comfortable."
"JESS: Before we're on Social Security?"
"RORY: I promise, we can kiss secretly."
"JESS: Yeah, or we can wear Three Stooges masks all the time, that way no one will know who we are."
"RORY: I can be Curly."
"JESS: I'll be Moe."
"RORY: Probably too silly."
"JESS: Yeah, probably."
"RORY: This will get better over time, I promise. But until then, let's just play it cool."
"JESS: Hey, I'm Frank at the Sands."
"RORY: That's cool."
"CUT TO INSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Lorelai is shopping]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, Kirk. Doing your holiday shopping?"
"KIRK: Well, shopping, yes, and it is a holiday, but my shopping isn't holiday related, so technically no."
"LORELAI: Oh, what happened there?"
"KIRK: Oh, nothing, just a little scratch."
"LORELAI: Looks like a big scratch. Wow, Bactine, Neosporin, Mercurochrome  what's with all the pharmacologicals?"
"KIRK: Oh, well, Kirk and I are going through a little adjustment period, that's all."
"LORELAI: CatKirk?"
"KIRK: It's no biggie, and this looks a lot worse than it is."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I can see that. So how'd it happen? Were you playing or something?"
"KIRK: We haven't actually played yet. This happened when I accidentally walked into the room without announcing myself."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"KIRK: I've discovered Kirk likes my presence announced before I enter any room that he's in."
"LORELAI: You have to announce yourself?"
"KIRK: Yeah, just a quick, Is it okay if I come in?' from the adjacent room. Otherwise, he gets a little testy."
"LORELAI: Hence the scratch."
"KIRK: It's just a small laceration. Again, no biggie."
"LORELAI: Kirk, he got your neck!"
"KIRK: That was another mistake of mine. I put his food bowl down in front of him. He doesn't like that. Or she doesn't."
"LORELAI: She? I thought Kirk was a boy."
"KIRK: That was just a guess. He actually hasn't exposed his underside to me yet. Or hers."
"LORELAI: Well, here's hoping your cat exposes itself to you soon."
"KIRK: From your mouth to God's ears. See ya."
"LORELAI: See ya."
"[Lorelai walks over to Dean]"
"LORELAI: Hi there."
"DEAN: Hi."
"LORELAI: So you pulled the Thanksgiving shift, huh?"
"DEAN: Yeah, I get time and a half."
"LORELAI: Well, good, good. It's good to see you."
"DEAN: Same here. Um, so, I gotta work."
"LORELAI: Right, right. That Taylor's a dictator."
"DEAN: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Dean, wait. Um, look, we live in a teeny tiny little hamlet here. I mean, stick it in an envelope and we could mail the whole town for a buck-forty. It makes avoiding people tough and uncomfortable."
"DEAN: I know."
"LORELAI: I hate hiding from people, especially when I don't wanna hide from them. You were a pal. You were so good to Rory. You were the best first boyfriend a mother could've hoped for."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"LORELAI: It's okay to keep avoiding me if you want. I just wanted you to know that you don't need to, okay? Just because you and Rory broke up doesn't mean we did."
"DEAN: Good. That's good to hear."
"LORELAI: Well, Happy Thanksgiving."
"DEAN: Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai walks out of the diner with a bag. Rory is waiting with several bouquets of flowers]"
"LORELAI: Aw, pretty!"
"RORY: Yeah, good selection today. You get everything?"
"LORELAI: And then some. Look."
"RORY: Chocolate turkeys, nice!"
"LORELAI: I think they'll add a festive air."
"RORY: Definitely. So, was he in there?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, he was."
"RORY: Good, good. I hope he's good. Did he seem good?"
"LORELAI: He seemed good. He's getting time and a half."
"RORY: Good, good."
"LORELAI: So, let's go eat."
"RORY: And eat and eat."
"LORELAI: And eat and eat and eat."
"RORY: And eat and eat and eat and eat. . ."
"LORELAI: And eat and eat and eat and eat. . ."
"RORY: And eat some more."
"LORELAI: And eat and eat."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs. Kim opens the door; Lorelai and Rory are on the porch]"
"MRS. KIM: Ah, the Gilmores. Happy Thanksgiving."
"LORELAI: Happy Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Happy Thanksgiving."
"MRS. KIM: Come in."
"LORELAI: She's in a good mood this year."
"RORY: Downright chipper."
"LORELAI: So, um, Mrs. Kim, we, uh, we brought gifts."
"RORY: Flowers."
"LORELAI: And cranberry sauce, our little Thanksgiving tradition."
"MRS. KIM: Thank you, can never have too much."
"RORY: That's what we say."
"LORELAI: Plus, a chocolate turkey."
"MRS. KIM: What should I do with this?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know, let the kids share it."
"MRS. KIM: And then send a blank check to their dentist?"
"LORELAI: They don't have to eat it, they can play with it."
"MRS. KIM: Play with chocolate? It's missing its head."
"LORELAI: Ooh, that one's ours. Here, this one has a head. There ya go."
"MRS. KIM: Okay. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: My arms are too short to box with Mrs. Kim."
"RORY: The singing's already g*n."
"LORELAI: Mm. Who's that playing guitar? He looks familiar."
"RORY: Oh my God, that's Lane's Dave."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, it is. He's all neat and tidy."
"RORY: He's gone corporate."
"LORELAI: He's gone Korean."
"[Lane walks by and sees them]"
"LANE: Oh, hey, hi."
"RORY: Hey yourself. Hey, how'd you get your mom to let you "
"LANE: Come on, girls, let's get you some punch. [leads them to the other room]"
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LANE: That is not Dave Rygalski."
"LORELAI: Oh, intrigue."
"RORY: Who is it?"
"LANE: I mean, not the one that I'm in a band with. That is Dave Rygalski, local Christian guitar player that my mom and I met very briefly and innocently at the dance marathon, and that I coincidentally ran across again when I found his ad seeking Christian guitar accompaniment gigs up on our church bulletin board."
"LORELAI: Complicated."
"LANE: I even put the fake ad up at church and pretended to find it with my mom next to me."
"RORY: You're good."
"LORELAI: So, are you guys dating?"
"LANE: We're laying the groundwork. If she gets to know him before we date and she approves of him, we won't have to hide anything."
"LORELAI: Right, except how you met."
"RORY: And who he really is."
"LANE: But other than that, it's completely fib-free. Shh, shh!"
"MRS. KIM: Watch it. You break it, you buy it. Ten percent off for cousins, twenty percent off for nephews and nieces."
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Lane walk into the room where the food table is set up]"
"LORELAI: Yung Kwan, good to see you. Hee Kim, hi. Oh, I love your hair. Su Nam, hi. Hi. Ho Kyung, Wan Kyu, great to see you, hi. Oh, Mrs. Kim, just a beautiful table, as always."
"MRS. KIM: Try the tofurkey. Turkey made from tofu."
"RORY: Oh, we definitely will."
"LORELAI: Mm."
"MRS. KIM: And meet the guitar player. Nice young man, big fan of tofurkey. David?"
"DAVE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: This is Rory Gilmore and Mrs. Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Hi, nice to meet you."
"DAVE: Oh, same here."
"RORY: I think I've seen you around town."
"DAVE: Yeah, that might be a possibility. Happy Thanksgiving."
"LORELAI: Same to you."
"MRS. KIM: Hymn 17 please."
"DAVE: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Wow, he seems like a very upright young man."
"MRS. KIM: Not a bad sight-reader either. [walks away]"
"RORY: You're taking tofurkey?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh, and some extra napkins to slip the tofurkey into when no one is looking and then toss them away."
"RORY: Very smart."
"LANE: Um, Mama, just a thought, but maybe we can take a break from the hymns while we eat?"
"MRS. KIM: No break, he's paid to play. We can quit singing for now, but he should play soft in the background, okay?"
"DAVE: Yeah. Yes, ma'am."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: The best laid plans."
"LORELAI: Tell me about it."
"RORY: How do you feel?"
"LORELAI: I ate tofurkey. How do you think I feel?"
"RORY: Tofurkier."
"LORELAI: Drat that Mrs. Kim for not taking her eyes off me the whole time. . . it's like she was anticipating my napkin maneuver."
"[They walk up to Sookie's yard. Sookie is sitting at a picnic table, and a group of people is standing near the porch]"
"LORELAI: Hi hon!"
"RORY: Happy Thanksgiving."
"SOOKIE: Ah, thank you. Thank God, civilization has arrived."
"LORELAI: What's wrong?"
"SOOKIE: What's wrong? Uh, do you not see what's going on here?"
"LORELAI: What's that?"
"SOOKIE: That is a vat of boiling oil."
"LORELAI: Really? Where's Quasimodo?"
"SOOKIE: This is not a joking matter."
"RORY: What is the oil for?"
"LORELAI: For pouring on visigoths."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: When else am I gonna get to use my visigoth material?"
"RORY: What's the oil for?"
"SOOKIE: The turkey. My beautiful, expensive, organically grown turkey."
"LORELAI: I don't get it."
"SOOKIE: A couple of days ago, Jackson asked me if he could cook the turkey. I thought he was gonna roast it, stick a couple of onions around it, something simple. So I said yes, figuring that the minute he put it in the oven and leaves the kitchen, I can sneak in and give it a nice herb-bitter rub and stuff it with a pancetta-chestnut stuffing."
"LORELAI: Sure, cause he'd never notice that."
"SOOKIE: Exactly. Then the propane t*nk arrived, and the industrial burner, and the fifteen gallons of peanut oil. Then he springs it on me  I'm gonna deep-fry a turkey."""
"LORELAI: Deep-fried turkey."
"RORY: Interesting."
"SOOKIE: I tried to talk him out of it, but I'd already promised and now he's excited about it."
"GUY 1: Hey, what's keeping Jackson? Is he on the pot or something?"
"SOOKIE: Lots of precious memories in the making here."
"GUY 1: Hey Jackson, get your butt out here with that gobbler!"
"SOOKIE: A gobbler."
"RORY: Maybe it won't be that bad."
"LORELAI: Yeah, deep-frying's kind of in now."
"SOOKIE: I don't care. You don't deep-fry turkey. Uh, filet of fish, yes. A batch of fries, yes. A donut, yes. Not turkey."
"GUY 1: Come on, let's get going!"
"GUY 2: Yeah, we're hungry!"
"EVERYONE: Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson, Jackson. . ."
"[Jackson pushes open the door and holds up the turkey]"
"JACKSON: Did someone say. . .Jackson?"
"[the crowd cheers]"
"LORELAI: Wow, it's like Thunderdome in here."
"SOOKIE: He should've just driven it out on a monster truck. He's shamelessly catering to his demographic."
"JACKSON: Are you ready?"
"[the crowd cheers]"
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, I can't look."
"EVERYONE: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. . ."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, they're counting down."
"EVERYONE: . . .five, four, three, two, one!"
"[Jackson lowers the turkey into the vat]"
"LORELAI: It's in the vat."
"SOOKIE: It's like a death in the family."
"LORELAI: Look at the bright side, Sookie. At least this took your mind off the dinner at the inn."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, the inn. What if Bob decides to do something equally awful to the turkey at the inn? I have to call him."
"JACKSON: Oh, hey guys."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"JACKSON: Neat, huh? And it only takes forty minutes."
"LORELAI: Cool."
"JACKSON: How ya doing, hon?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, fine, Sweets. [Lorelai hands her a beer] And keep them coming."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: Hey everybody."
"BABETTE: Oh, hey there dollfaces. Happy Thanksgiving."
"MOREY: Yeah, Happy Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Hey. [hands Luke a bouquet of flowers]"
"LUKE: What's this?"
"RORY: Flowers."
"LUKE: What do I do with them?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, not this again."
"RORY: Put them in a vase with water."
"LUKE: I don't have a vase."
"LORELAI: You do this every year."
"LUKE: I don't have vases."
"LORELAI: Buy a vase."
"LUKE: But I don't need a vase cause I never have flowers."
"LORELAI: Except when we bring you flowers every year on Thanksgiving. Buy a vase."
"LUKE: Stop bringing me flowers."
"LORELAI: Stop bringing me flowers. I knew you were gonna say that because you say the same thing. We have this same exact conversation every year."
"LUKE: And every year you point that out."
"LORELAI: And every year you point that out."
"LUKE: And every year you point that out."
"RORY: And then every year we put the flowers on the counter and forget the ugliness ever happened."
"LORELAI: Well, at least we have a tradition."
"LUKE: Good. I'll be right back. That's our table over there."
"LORELAI: Hey Kirk. Oh my God!"
"RORY: What happened?"
"KIRK: I'm scratched over sixty percent of my body."
"LORELAI: Aw, CatKirk again?"
"KIRK: Ow."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"BABETTE: I'm so mad at that cat."
"MOREY: Very uncool cat."
"BABETTE: I love cats, but I love Kirk, too. It's pretty much fifty-fifty, and that's a high compliment, my friend."
"LORELAI: How did this happen?"
"KIRK: Well, the tension of our standoff was unbearable, so I got on the floor and tried to play with him."
"LORELAI: It's a him?"
"KIRK: I caught a peek."
"LORELAI: Go on."
"KIRK: I rolled this cute little ball of yarn over to him all nice and gentle. He tried to garrote me with it."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"MOREY: Very uncool."
"KIRK: Just grabbed two ends with his paws and came at me."
"RORY: But he doesn't have opposable thumbs."
"KIRK: He's beyond them. And he's smart. He knows things, sometimes before they happen."
"LORELAI: Get a hold of yourself, man."
"KIRK: You haven't heard the worst."
"RORY: Oh geez, there's worse?"
"KIRK: When the attacks got particularly brutal, I had no choice but to strip naked and hide under water in the bathtub. I read that cats are afraid of water."
"BABETTE: They are, they are."
"KIRK: Kirk isn't. He found me, and he seemed to derive greater power from the water. That's when the bulk of the scratching happened."
"LORELAI: Well, then, I think it's good you're giving Kirk a little space right now. Just relax and enjoy your food."
"KIRK: I can't taste my food."
"LORELAI: Well, then, just try to relax."
"KIRK: Thanks."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk over to their table; Jess walks over]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey. [they kiss]"
"JESS: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi, Happy Thanksgiving. So, are you joining us?"
"JESS: Uh, sure, if that's okay."
"LORELAI: Yeah, sit, sit."
"[Luke and Caesar bring the plates over]"
"JESS: God, I'm starved."
"LUKE: You could've eaten."
"JESS: You kept telling me not to eat."
"LUKE: I did not."
"JESS: You did, too. You said you were waiting for them."
"LORELAI: Aw, you didn't have to wait for us."
"LUKE: I wasn't waiting for you, it just worked out this way."
"JESS: Right."
"RORY: Looks great."
"LORELAI: Tasty."
"LUKE: Shouldn't we give thanks first?"
"JESS: Thanks for what?"
"LUKE: Well, that we're not Native Americans who got their land stolen in exchange for smallpox infested blankets."
"LORELAI: Amen."
"LUKE: So where you guys in your day?"
"RORY: We hit the Kim's, we hit Sookie's, and we go to the grandparents from here."
"LORELAI: Full day."
"LUKE: Yeah. Well, you can skip eating this one if you want. Just have cokes or something, it's no big deal."
"LORELAI: No, no way, you're the main event today, my friend."
"LUKE: Oh, good."
"RORY: What's good are the yams."
"LORELAI: Definitely. Got some more marshmallows?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I can grab some. Hey, refill some coffees. [Luke and Jess walk away]"
"LORELAI: So, no offense, but lame-o kiss."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You and Jess, like a couple chickens pecking at each other."
"RORY: Mind your own business."
"LORELAI: Well, it was right in front of me."
"RORY: So, I don't need a review."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: I'm just not good with the public displays."
"LORELAI: You didn't have that problem with Dean."
"RORY: I know, but now I just feel like everybody's watching me."
"LORELAI: People are not watching you."
"RORY: You were watching me."
"LORELAI: I created you. It's biologically predetermined that I watch you."
"RORY: I just don't know how this whole second boyfriend thing is supposed to go."
"LORELAI: Well, he's your first second boyfriend. Give it time."
"RORY: The whole town got used to me with Dean, it's just weird."
"LORELAI: It'll get easier. You're gonna have hundreds of men in your life."
"RORY: Gee, thanks."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe not hundreds, but a couple, three, more. It'll get easier."
"RORY: I guess."
"LORELAI: Honey, they'll adjust to seeing you with Jess."
"RORY: And then there's Dean. What do I do about him?"
"LORELAI: Well, you know, he'll be moving on, too."
"RORY: Oh, right, of course he will, yeah."
"BABETTE: Well, we're outta here."
"MOREY: Time to walk some of this off."
"BABETTE: Oh, we'd have to walk to China to walk all of it off. Which way's China?"
"LORELAI: Thataway. Have a good night."
"BABETTE: Thanks. By the way, that was some half-assed kiss you two had. You gotta give it a little something, honey."
"LORELAI: Bye Babette. Bye Morey."
"BABETTE: Bye."
"RORY: The whole town is watching."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the front door]"
"RORY: You ready for this?"
"LORELAI: Of course."
"RORY: Even with the Cold w*r?"
"LORELAI: That's been going on for thirty-four years? I can manage."
"RORY: It's been a bit colder these past few weeks."
"LORELAI: Oh no, I'm fine, you know why? Because in two hours  and I do plan on extricating us from here in exactly two hours  the night will be over and I won't have to see them again until next year. Oh, start your stopwatch."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"EMILY: Hello."
"RORY: Hi Grandma. Happy Thanksgiving."
"EMILY: Thank you, Rory. Happy Thanksgiving, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Happy Thanksgiving. [mumbles to Rory] One hour, fifty-nine minutes, and forty seconds."
"[they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, it's a piano player."
"EMILY: That's Brad. I found him at Nordstrom's."
"LORELAI: Was he on sale?"
"EMILY: I thought a little background music would add a nice touch. He knows every song ever written."
"LORELAI: Free Bird! Hi Brad."
"EMILY: Lorelai, please. Now come along, everyone's here. [they walk to living room] We're all here."
"RICHARD: Oh, good. Happy Thanksgiving, Rory."
"RORY: Happy Thanksgiving, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Dad."
"RICHARD: These are our guests, Natalie and Douglas Swope."
"EMILY: You two have met."
"LORELAI: Yes, at the auction."
"NATALIE: Good to see you again."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"DOUGLAS: Nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: Yes, you, too."
"RORY: Same here."
"RICHARD: And this is our international contingent, Claude and Monique Clemenceau. They're just in from France."
"LORELAI: Ah, Clemenceau, huh, I'd have guessed Spain."
"CLAUDE: Hello, how are you? [kisses Lorelai's hand]"
"LORELAI: Oh, ooh."
"MONIQUE: Hello."
"RICHARD: Monique, voici ma fille et ma petite fille."
"MONIQUE: Ah. Elle sont si jolies."
"CLAUDE: My Monique speaks only French, so please excuse the inconvenience."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, that's fine. I love French."
"CLAUDE: She really wants to learn English, perhaps tonight will inspire her. [to Monique] Je leur ai dit que tu voulais à prendre l'anglais."
"MONIQUE: L'anglais, oui, je veux à prendre, mais je suis tellement parasseuse."
"RICHARD: Ah, ça prends de temps, Monique. Ah, t'en fais pas."
"MONIQUE: Merci."
"RICHARD: Oh, no no no. That's why I love it when the Clemenceaus visit. It gives me the opportunity to haul out my rusty French."
"CLAUDE: Your French is wonderful, Richard. It always has been."
"RICHARD: Aw, non, tu es tres gentil. Please, sit, sit, sit."
"CLAUDE: Merci. So, Rory, you speak French at all?"
"RORY: Just a tiny little bit."
"CLAUDE: Un tout petite peu?"
"RORY: Oui, un tout petite peu."
"CLAUDE: And you, my dear?"
"LORELAI: Even less. Uh, voulez vous couchez avec moi ce soir? That's about it."
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: It's just a joke."
"RICHARD: Asking my friend to go to bed with you is a joke?"
"RORY: It's a song."
"LORELAI: It's just a joke, Dad."
"CLAUDE: Oh, voici c'est un chanson du pop. It's a pop song, ah, Monique. . . I did not know that."
"MONIQUE: Lady Marmalade."
"CLAUDE: It's very rich. It's very, very funny."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, thank you."
"CLAUDE: You need a drink, oui?"
"LORELAI: Very astute, Claude. Martini with a twist, Dad."
"RICHARD: All right."
"DOUGLAS: Is this your first American Thanksgiving, Claude?"
"CLAUDE: It is, it is. I've seen it in the movies. People seem to eat and eat and eat until they can't eat anymore."
"LORELAI: That's about it."
"NATALIE: It's about giving thanks, gets you thinking about the good things."
"DOUGLAS: We have a lot to give thanks for in this country."
"EMILY: Definitely."
"CLAUDE: Me, I start each day giving thanks for three things  Cuban cigars, French champagne, and gorgeous women. And I must give extra thanks for the extraordinary group here tonight."
"LORELAI: Douglas, Richard, leave us, won't you?"
"RICHARD: What?"
"EMILY: Just another joke."
"CLAUDE: Oh, I missed another joke?"
"NATALIE: You have your mother's wit."
"EMILY: Sometimes I wish she'd give it back."
"DOUGLAS: Emily mentioned that you were coming from another function?"
"CLAUDE: No, this is your second dinner?"
"RORY: Fourth, actually."
"NATALIE: Fourth?"
"RICHARD: Oh, thank you for fitting us in, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Don't worry, Dad. You're the main event. [to Rory] An hour and fifty six minutes."
"CUT TO DINING ROOM"
"[Everyone is seated at the table]"
"NATALIE: Beautiful table, Emily. You've outdone yourself yet again."
"EMILY: Oh, it's nothing."
"RICHARD: Well, is everyone settled? Is everyone comfy?"
"EVERYONE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes, Dad, we're fine."
"RICHARD: Well, then, let's get going."
"[Emily rings a bell, the maids bring out the turkey]"
"NATALIE: Gorgeous."
"DOUGLAS: Oh, wonderful."
"CLAUDE: Is it for us or the whole neighborhood?"
"NATALIE: Very nice."
"[Richard carves a piece off, then the maids start to take the turkey away]"
"LORELAI: Oh, ho, who gets the big piece?"
"RICHARD: I'm sorry?"
"LORELAI: Aren't you supposed to keep carving?"
"RICHARD: That was strictly ceremonial."
"LORELAI: Ceremonial?"
"EMILY: Ceremonial."
"CLAUDE: Cérémonial."
"MONIQUE: Cérémonial."
"EMILY: Please, start on the salads everyone."
"LORELAI: Is there anything ceremonial about the salads? Do we carve a crouton, then have them taken away?"
"EMILY: No, no ceremony."
"RORY: Salad's great, Grandma."
"EMILY: I'm surprised you can eat at this point, even salad."
"RORY: There's still room."
"LORELAI: And if there isn't room, we'll add on. I know a good contractor."
"CLAUDE: She's like your Jerry Lewis. She's very, very funny."
"NATALIE: Rory, did your grandmother say you were a high school senior?"
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"NATALIE: So you're going through this horrible period of applying to college."
"RORY: It's not so horrible."
"RICHARD: She's got it pretty well covered."
"LORELAI: That's right."
"NATALIE: All your applications are in?"
"RORY: I've applied."
"DOUGLAS: We have a grandson your age, he's going through hell."
"NATALIE: He's already been turned down for early admission to Stanford, his dream."
"DOUGLAS: Took it pretty hard."
"NATALIE: Children put so much stress on themselves these days."
"RORY: It's pretty stressful."
"NATALIE: He's waiting to hear from his backups."
"CLAUDE: I have a grandson who lives with his mother in Orlando, you know, he's going through a very similar thing, poor boy."
"EMILY: How do they like Orlando, Claude?"
"CLAUDE: Well, it's all Mickey Mouse this and Mickey Mouse that, you know. They want to die."
"EMILY: That's too bad."
"NATALIE: Where did you apply, dear?"
"RORY: Harvard."
"DOUGLAS: No word yet?"
"RORY: I'm not supposed to hear back for awhile."
"DOUGLAS: Where else?"
"RORY: Where else?"
"DOUGLAS: Where else did you apply? Your alternates?"
"NATALIE: We're so curious, it's like we've been going through this ourselves."
"RORY: Well, I'm pretty much counting on Harvard."
"DOUGLAS: Well, you didn't apply to just Harvard, did you?"
"RORY: Well, no."
"LORELAI: No?"
"NATALIE: Am I prying?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: We applied elsewhere?"
"DOUGLAS: You can't just apply to one place."
"NATALIE: Chilton wouldn't allow that."
"LORELAI: Is that true?"
"RORY: Pretty much."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you tell me that?"
"RORY: I was going to."
"NATALIE: You have to be safe."
"CLAUDE: My grandson  six schools."
"DOUGLAS: Same with Dustin."
"LORELAI: Where else did you apply?"
"RORY: Just at some other schools."
"DOUGLAS: Well, if you're aiming at Harvard, that would be Princeton, Yale, maybe Vassar, Wesleyan."
"CLAUDE: Certainly Yale because of Richard's connections, yes?"
"NATALIE: I would assume so."
"RORY: Those are the kinds of places, yup."
"LORELAI: The kinds of places or the places? Rory?"
"RORY: Princeton. . . um, Yale."
"LORELAI: Yale?"
"RICHARD: Yes?"
"LORELAI: Yale, Dad?"
"RICHARD: Oh, this is the first I'm hearing about it, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, bull."
"RORY: Mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You did this."
"RICHARD: I haven't discussed this awful subject since the debacle at the campus."
"LORELAI: You forced her hand."
"RICHARD: I did nothing of the sort."
"RORY: Mom, wait."
"LORELAI: You made it seem like you'd be deeply hurt if she didn't apply to Yale, and she's very sensitive, so that's as good as forcing her hand."
"EMILY: Lorelai, really."
"LORELAI: You wanted her to go to Yale instead of Harvard, didn't you?"
"RICHARD: Well, that wasn't a secret."
"CLAUDE: Lorelai ne veut pas que Rory aille à Yale."
"RICHARD: Je suis désolé de ce qui ce passe ici."
"LORELAI: Stick to English, Dad."
"RORY: Grandpa didn't force my hand."
"LORELAI: Honey, you weren't aware he was doing it."
"RICHARD: She is not a puppet, Lorelai."
"RORY: I needed a backup."
"LORELAI: But why Yale?"
"RORY: I could live at home."
"LORELAI: You."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, you got to her. That was your thing."
"NATALIE: I'm afraid we started this."
"EMILY: This is not your doing, Natalie."
"RICHARD: Encore une fois, je suis désolé."
"EMILY: I never spoke to Rory about that."
"LORELAI: I don't believe you."
"RORY: I figured it out on my own, Mom."
"LORELAI: You're saying there have been no conversations, no emails?"
"RORY: I can read a map."
"LORELAI: This is unbelievable."
"RICHARD: And past indelicate. We have guests."
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm sorry, I apologize, I'm sorry you have to see this."
"EMILY: This is paranoia, Lorelai. There's been no conspiring."
"LORELAI: I'm not being paranoid, Mom. For seventeen years, she was going to Harvard, and now all of a sudden, she's applied to Yale and she's mimicking everything you say. This is just crazy. [leaves the room]"
"CLAUDE: Elle a dit que, c'est de la folie.'"
"EMILY: Excuse me, please."
"CUT TO BACK PATIO"
"[Lorelai is standing outside as Emily walks out the back door]"
"EMILY: It's freezing out here."
"LORELAI: It's Jamaica compared to in there."
"EMILY: It's just an alternative to Harvard, a backup. It changes nothing."
"LORELAI: No, no."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, I don't wanna talk."
"EMILY: Do you believe we had nothing to do with this?"
"LORELAI: Just for a second, Mom, please. Just let me digest this for a second. All this Yale stuff. . .agh!"
"EMILY: You can't even let Rory have one piece of our lives, even if it's her choice. You hate us that much."
"[Lorelai doesn't respond. Emily walks back into the house]"
"CUT TO THE KIM'S HOUSE"
"[The last of the guests are leaving]"
"MRS. KIM: Goodbye, drive safe."
"GUEST: Thank you. [leaves]"
"LANE: Excellent Thanksgiving, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: I think people had fun."
"LANE: And it was nice of you to only charge half price on the chair that Yung Hee broke."
"MRS. KIM: That was my cost."
"LANE: That why it was nice."
"DAVE: Well, I guess I'll be going."
"MRS. KIM: All right. You did a good job. Thank you for your time, David."
"DAVE: Oh, you're welcome, Mrs. Kim. I enjoyed it."
"LANE: Yes, thank you."
"DAVE: You're welcome."
"MRS. KIM: Here. Some rice, spinach, lots of tofurkey."
"DAVE: Great, thanks."
"MRS. KIM: And something for your time."
"DAVE: That's very nice, thank you. Happy Thanksgiving."
"MRS. KIM: Goodbye."
"[Dave leaves]"
"MRS. KIM: Keep clearing. I'm going to start on the kitchen."
"LANE: Okay. Oh, Mama, look. Dave's bible. He forgot it. He's gonna need this, too. I'll run it out to him."
"MRS. KIM: Wait."
"LANE: We're gonna miss him."
"MRS. KIM: Let me see that. [takes the bible and reads the inside cover] This bible belongs to God, but is being used by Dave Rygalski.' [hands the bible back to Lane] Go on."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lane rushes down the sidewalk; Dave is waiting by a tree]"
"DAVE: Wow, you run really quiet."
"LANE: Sorry, I'm sorry about everything."
"DAVE: What?"
"LANE: The whole night. I had no idea she'd make you play five straight hours without a break."
"DAVE: It's okay."
"LANE: Your hands must be dead."
"DAVE: They're just a little numb. But I've got these Kurt Cobain calluses now, how cool is that?"
"LANE: But this whole thing, this whole charade, the fake flier and everything, it was too much."
"DAVE: Lane, it's fine. And that flier  I've gotten like three other calls for paying gigs. I should be paying you a commission."
"LANE: Oh, that's not necessary."
"DAVE: And check it out  twenty bucks."
"LANE: Wow, she liked you."
"DAVE: We'll put it towards our first real date."
"LANE: Really? After all this  the marathon hymns, the weak punch, the crabby Koreans, you still wanna go out on a date with me?"
"[Dave nods, then kisses her]"
"DAVE: I've gotta go. . . but I'm gonna call you tomorrow."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street]"
"RORY: Are you mad?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not mad."
"RORY: You seem mad."
"LORELAI: I'm not mad."
"RORY: What are you feeling?"
"LORELAI: I wouldn't know how to word it."
"RORY: Try."
"LORELAI: See, my head knows that whichever one of these places you go, Harvard, Princeton, Yale. . .it's gonna be great. It's gonna be awesome, and you're gonna come out on the other side an even more amazing you. But I just wish my head could sit down and have a chat with that gnawing feeling in my gut that's there every time my parents get involved in anything and tell it, it's gonna be okay."
"RORY: It's gonna be okay."
"LORELAI: Nice try."
"[They walk across Sookie's front yard]"
"JACKSON: What else are we putting in the pot? Come on, let's think of something. Uh, a raspberry, a deep-fried raspberry. How bout a rasquat?"
"GUY: Cake!"
"JACKSON: Cake! Deep-fried cake!"
"GUY: Dibs on the deep-fried cake!"
"JACKSON: You haven't even eaten your deep-fried biscotti."
"[Lorelai and Rory sit down at the picnic table with Sookie]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Ah, hi there."
"LORELAI: Are you okay?"
"SOOKIE: This tastes good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it looks like they're deep-frying "
"SOOKIE: Everything."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"SOOKIE: Vegetables, mashed potatoes, butter, pickles, salt, a napkin."
"RORY: And yet, you're very serene."
"LORELAI: Uh, you're practically floating."
"SOOKIE: Well, you caught me at a good time, ladies. I've already gone through the five stages of grieving. Denial, anger. . .I don't remember these two, but they were served on the rocks with salt! Now, I'm just happily enscotched in acceptance. Enscotched. . ."
"RORY: Ensconced?"
"SOOKIE: Ensconced  that's it! I do believe I heard Phil suggest throwing Junior in."
"LORELAI: Junior?"
"SOOKIE: His nephew."
"LORELAI: Whoa."
"SOOKIE: I chimed in on that one."
"LORELAI: What happened over there?"
"SOOKIE: Mm, about a half-hour ago they set the lawn on fire."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"SOOKIE: But Phil says it's okay and everything cause it'll grow back twice as lush. Though that's what he said when he broke my salad bowl that I brought back from Belgium. That'll maybe grow back, too, huh? [laughs] Phil is a riot. Am I crying or laughing?"
"LORELAI: Laughing."
"SOOKIE: Good."
"[Rory's pager goes off]"
"LORELAI: Who's that?"
"RORY: It's Lane. It just says bible kiss bible'."
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: I have no idea. Good band name, though."
"LORELAI: Honey, we should get going? You gonna be okay?"
"SOOKIE: I'm Sookie."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but you're gonna be okay, right? You'll go to bed soon."
"SOOKIE: Unless they deep-fried it."
"LORELAI: I'm sure they haven't. Okay, we'll see you tomorrow."
"[Lorelai and Rory start walking away]"
"RORY: Poor thing."
"LORELAI: Oh, she may not remember any of it."
"JACKSON: Deep-fried shoe!"
"GUY: Deep-fried shoe!"
"[Everyone cheers]"
"CUT TO FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke and Jess walk out of the diner; Jess is carrying a garbage bag]"
"JESS: Get more trash cans."
"LUKE: I don't need more."
"JESS: You make me run around town for a place to dump this."
"LUKE: Just dump it in one of Taylor's bins. It gets it out of here and it'll drive Taylor crazy. It's a win-win."
"LORELAI: Hi guys."
"LUKE: We're out of food."
"LORELAI: Oh, please, we're not eating for a year."
"RORY: Or til tomorrow morning."
"LORELAI: Whichever comes first. Hi Saint Nick."
"JESS: Tell him he needs to get more trash cans."
"LUKE: Just go."
"LORELAI: You got any coffee?"
"LUKE: That I've got. Come on in. Hey, did I see flames coming from Sookie's place about a half-hour ago?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, why?"
"[Lorelai and Luke walk into the diner. Rory follows Jess down the sidewalk]"
"JESS: I still say you should get more tra. . ."
"[Rory kisses him]"
"RORY: Hi."
"JESS: Hi."
"RORY: Later."
"[Rory walks away. As Jess carries the trash bag down the street, he finds Dean standing on the sidewalk]"
"DEAN: Nothing to say?"
"JESS: Guess not."
"DEAN: That's funny, you usually have something to say."
"JESS: Guess I'm all talked out."
"DEAN: What's the matter, Jess? Why you walking away?"
"JESS: It's getting a little West Side Story here, Dean, and I gotta warn you, my dancing k*ll are not up to snuff."
"DEAN: But now's your chance, there's no one else around."
"JESS: Go home. Cool off."
"DEAN: Come on, make one of your Boy Scout references, or a good Farmer John joke. I got my Doose's Market apron with me  you want me to put it on, give you a little inspiration? I don't get it, what happened  you suddenly like me now?"
"JESS: Oh yeah, I was just about to invite you camping."
"DEAN: Good, okay, now we're getting somewhere."
"JESS: I'm not gonna fight you, Dean."
"DEAN: Why?"
"JESS: Cause if I fight you, Rory's gonna think it's my fault, so just forget it, okay? Just forget it. Go home. Let it rest."
"DEAN: So Rory's got a nice little hold on you now, huh?"
"JESS: Geez. Don't do that."
"DEAN: How does it feel?"
"JESS: It feels like I'm with Rory and you're not."
"DEAN: You know, when all this happened with you and me and Rory, I figured I'd just stay out of everyone's way, that that would be easiest. But now, I'm looking at you and I'm thinking, I'm gonna run from him? The Glad Man. This is my town, I'm not hiding. And I don't have be remotely calm around you anymore, and I like that feeling. I like it a lot. Happy Thanksgiving, Jess."
"CUT TO INSIDE THE DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the counter]"
"LUKE: So, how did the four dinners work out? You guys must feel more stuffed than you've ever been."
"LORELAI: I don't know. Is this more stuffed than the great Six Flags hot dog consumption of 99?"
"RORY: No, or the taffy binge of '97."
"LORELAI: Not by a long sh*t. See, we didn't eat at my parents because of the upset, so we really had three dinners, not four."
"RORY: Which means. . ."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: We didn't have to skip rolls."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah. Hey, do you have any rolls left?"
"LUKE: No. Come on."
"LORELAI: Just a little something for the walk home."
"[Luke hands her a bag of rolls]"
"LUKE: I don't see how you do it."
"LORELAI: Well, you're not us, are ya? Night Luke."
"RORY: Night Luke."
"LUKE: Night."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk past the gazebo]"
"LORELAI: This has been a nice Thanksgiving."
"RORY: Very."
"LORELAI: Nicer for some than others though."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Night Kirk!"
"[Kirk is trying to go to sleep on a bench in the gazebo]"
"KIRK: Night."

"OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Lane are walking through the center of town]"
"LANE: Are you serious?"
"LORELAI: I am serious."
"LANE: We can really rehearse in your garage?"
"LORELAI: In exchange for the promise that you never pose naked on the cover of Rolling Stone no matter how much trouble your career is in."
"LANE: I promise. I love you. Do you know how amazing your mother is?"
"LORELAI: No. Tell her, would ya? She forgot this morning."
"RORY: Because hot water is enjoyed by all, not just by you."
"LORELAI: I wasn't in the shower that long."
"RORY: Man, it's winter carnival time again already."
"LANE: Yup."
"RORY: Are you going?"
"LANE: I have to. We are raising money for the marching band this year, mandatory booth manning is involved."
"LORELAI: Man, Lane  marching band, rock band."
"LANE: Music is my life."
"LORELAI: Hi Mrs. Kim!"
"LANE: So not funny."
"RORY: Raising money for the marching band to do what?"
"LORELAI: Please let it be new uniforms."
"LANE: It's for letters so we can finally have letter carriers. For some reason, the powers that be think that the reason we never win at competitions is because no one knows who we are. The fact that we suck has never occurred to them. What's wrong with our uniforms?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"LANE: We look stupid, right?"
"LORELAI: No."
"LANE: The plumes are too big, and it looks like big red fountains of blood spurting out of our heads."
"LORELAI: I love the uniforms."
"LANE: It's bad enough I have to be in marching band at all without being mocked for what is mandatory for us to wear."
"LORELAI: No, no, no, I didn't mean, I. . .remind her that she gets to rehearse in our garage cause I think I'm losing points here."
"RORY: Your uniforms are great, and people knowing who you are can only help. Now let's just enjoy the snow, okay?"
"LANE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Especially since some of us have been freezing since our showers this morning."
"LORELAI: I wasn't in there that long."
"LANE: I'm sorry, can we get back to the band uniforms, cause on a scale of one to ten, how much do I not wanna let Dave see me like that?"
"LORELAI/RORY: Ten."
"LANE: Okay, thanks."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"TEACHER: To evaluate the value of a function of X when X equals pi. You want to start by splitting the intregal into two separate intregals. Now, since the left intregal is a variable of a constant exponent, remember C is a constant, add one and divide by the new power."
"MADELINE: Paris, what did he say?"
"PARIS: Hm?"
"MADELINE: He's talking too fast, I missed it."
"PARIS: Ask Louise."
"MADELINE: Louise, what did he say?"
"LOUISE: I don't know, ask Paris."
"MADELINE: She told me to ask you."
"LOUISE: Why would she do that?"
"MADELINE: I don't know."
"LOUISE: Did you guys have a fight?"
"MADELINE: Not that I know of."
"TEACHER: . . . The right intregal, however, is more complex. You have to use U substitution with U equals 3 feet. [bell rings] We'll pick up at the same place tomorrow."
"RORY: The bell rang."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: The bell? That loud metal musical contraption that when hit loudly by a vibrating mallet signals the end of this particular educational experience."
"PARIS: Class is over?"
"RORY: Yup."
"PARIS: What did he talk about?"
"MADELINE: Ask Louise."
"PARIS: I didn't take notes. I didn't pay attention. I'm going to. . ."
"RORY: Borrow my notes and be just fine."
"PARIS: Thank you."
"MADELINE: Madeline want notes, too, please."
"LOUISE: Add one and divide by the new power? Oh, I thought it said add one and divide by the Jew power. It makes much more sense this way."
"PARIS: I can't believe I zoned out for the entire class."
"RORY: You must have a lot on your mind."
"PARIS: I do."
"RORY: I'm sure. Okay, so, onto the next thing. I don't think I'll have the prom bids ready for the supplemental student council meeting this week."
"PARIS: Oh."
"RORY: They need a little more time to get the details together, so that leaves a little hole in our agenda. Any thoughts?"
"PARIS: Well, we can just cancel the supplementary meeting this week."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Well, if there's nothing really to talk about, what's the point, right?"
"LOUISE: You said that one student council meeting a week was not enough."
"MADELINE: Yeah, you said that was no way to govern, that meeting once a week was lazy, ineffectual, and if we were going to do it like that, we might as well just buy ourselves a ranch in Texas."
"PARIS: Fine, if you guys wanna sit around for an hour after school swapping makeover horror stories, then count me in. Hey, did I ever tell you about the time I plucked outside of my designated brow line? Man, was my face red."
"MADELINE: I've done that, too. Ooh, it's bad."
"LOUISE: She was being sarcastic."
"MADELINE: Well, I wasn't. I looked surprised for a month."
"PARIS: We'll just take this week off, and next week we'll go back to twice a week, okay?"
"RORY: Sounds fair."
"LOUISE: Sounds fab."
"FRANCIE: I heard something about the supplemental student council meeting  anything I need to know about, a new chart to be made, perhaps?"
"PARIS: No. We were just saying that the agenda seems light this week, so I've decided to cancel it, and we can just gather at the regular meeting on Friday."
"FRANCIE: Wow, this is quite a change in plans."
"PARIS: You have a problem with it?"
"FRANCIE: No, I'm just surprised. You seem so attached to those meetings."
"PARIS: Well, I finally got a blankie. It's much better."
"FRANCIE: Okay, no extra meeting this week. What will I do with all that extra time? Well, I guess I'll think of something."
"PARIS: Take a picture of which outfit wins, will ya?"
"RORY: Bye Francie."
"FRANCIE: Bye."
"[Rory and Paris walk into the hallway]"
"PARIS: I met his parents."
"RORY: You did?"
"PARIS: He bought me a ticket, and I took the train to Philadelphia, and he met me at the station, and I spent Christmas with him and his family."
"RORY: Sounds nice."
"PARIS: No, not nice. It was perfect. They had a Christmas tree twelve feet tall. Everything was red and silver and there was eggnog. Have you ever had eggnog?"
"RORY: Yes, I have."
"PARIS: It's disgusting."
"RORY: Yes, it is."
"PARIS: But disgusting in a really great way. And they had tiny wreaths hanging from every doorknob, and mistletoe and candles everywhere. I couldn't believe it. I mean, I've never had a Christmas before. One year, I asked my mother if we could get a Chanukah bush. She made me watch Shoah the rest of the week."
"RORY: Wow."
"PARIS: The place smelled like cinnamon all the time, and there was a fire in the fireplace, and a ton of presents. I mean, hundreds of presents. I'm looking at this mound of gifts, and I'm thinking, Eight days of Chanukah. . . who was the skinflint who thought up that deal?'"
"RORY: Don't the eight days symbolize something?"
"PARIS: Yes, they symbolize eight days of ripping off the little kids who can't have a Chanukah bush."
"RORY: You're making me sad."
"PARIS: His mother bought me a present."
"RORY: Well, that says something."
"PARIS: What does it say?"
"RORY: It says that Jamie likes you enough that she felt compelled to buy you a present."
"PARIS: I had the most amazing time. Sitting around the tree opening presents, and they played Christmas music and we drank apple cider. . .it was so nice. And then his grandfather and I wound up in a theological discussion. Jesus  Messiah or nice Jewish kid with a hammer? It got pretty heated."
"RORY: Okay, skip to the end, I can't take it. How did it turn out?"
"PARIS: He told me he loved me."
"RORY: Aw, Paris!"
"PARIS: I never thought I'd hear a boy tell me he loved me."
"RORY: That's great."
"PARIS: He invited me back up for Easter break."
"RORY: You're going, I assume?"
"PARIS: Are you kidding? And miss a chance to debate Christ rising from the dead? I'm so there."
"RORY: Jamie's a lucky man."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks through the dining room as Michel speaks Hungarian to a group of guests. The guests get angry, and Michel runs out of the room]"
"MICHEL: Move, please."
"LORELAI: Whoa, what's going on?"
"MICHEL: I cannot talk now, please."
"LORELAI: Michel, they sound really angry."
"MICHEL: They do, don't they?"
"LORELAI: What did you say?"
"MICHEL: I don't know."
"LORELAI: What do you mean you don't know? All you had to say was Welcome to Stars Hollow,' that's it."
"MICHEL: I know, I thought I did, and then they got angry and threw breadsticks and butter pats."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: I'm looking. [flips through a dictionary]"
"LORELAI: You only had to say one word in Hungarian  welcome, that's it. How bad could it be?"
"MICHEL: Very bad."
"LORELAI: Oh, Michel."
"MICHEL: Very, very bad."
"LORELAI: Be careful."
"[Michel walks back to the guests as the phone rings. Lorelai answers]"
"LORELAI: Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"EMILY: Well, your father's sixtieth birthday dinner is back on."
"LORELAI: What sixtieth birthday dinner?"
"EMILY: The one that I had planned for Wednesday night."
"LORELAI: Oh, were we coming?"
"EMILY: Of course you were coming. You think you wouldn't be invited?"
"LORELAI: Well, apparently, we weren't invited."
"EMILY: I had just started planning the whole thing when he came home in a mood and declared that parties were for children and it was canceled."
"LORELAI: Were we disappointed?"
"EMILY: However, today he came in and changed his mind, so I expect the two of you at eight. And bring a gift, but don't get him a cigar humidor."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: I bought him a cigar humidor."
"LORELAI: I assumed."
"EMILY: It's gorgeous. It belonged to a lieutenant in the army in World w*r I. Apparently, he kept it in his field office in France. There are carvings in the bottom that the dealer said could possibly be coded messages."
"LORELAI: Cool."
"EMILY: I think so, too. All right, eight o'clock, do not be late."
"LORELAI: Okay, we will not be late. Bye. [hangs up the phone as Michel walks back to the desk] Well?"
"MICHEL: It's fine. All we have to do is pay the ransom and they will give us the busboy back."
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, uh. . ."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen and starts screaming. She traps a spider under a cup on the floor. There's a knock at the back door.]"
"LORELAI: Come in. [Dean walks in] Dean, hi."
"DEAN: Hi. Uh, I hope I'm not disturbing anything."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, absolutely not."
"DEAN: Good. Um, I just wanted to. . ."
"LORELAI: Ah, ah!"
"DEAN: What?"
"LORELAI: Don't kick the cup."
"DEAN: The what?"
"LORELAI: I have a spider whose previous credits include the bathtub scene from Annie Hall trapped under that cup."
"DEAN: The size of a Buick?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"DEAN: I see. And what are you planning to do now that you've got him trapped?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was thinking of just giving him the kitchen."
"DEAN: Okay."
"LORELAI: Cause, you know, we don't use it very much anyhow, so, uh. . ."
"DEAN: I could get rid of it if you want."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that'd be great. Just, careful . . . He heard me talking, so don't let him get away. He knows I'm behind this, he'll come after me. Ugh, ugh, ugh. I guess you can see why camping's completely out of the question for me."
"DEAN: Got it."
"LORELAI: Okay, great. Could ya. . .uh. . .[gestures to the back door]"
"DEAN: Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem."
"LORELAI: Don't let his family see you. Spiders are vindictive."
"[Dean takes the spider out the back door]"
"RORY: [calls from front hall] Mom?"
"LORELAI: Uh, Rory."
"[Rory walks into the kitchen]"
"RORY: Can we do pizza tonight? I've got a ton of studying to do."
"LORELAI: Sure, pizza sounds great."
"RORY: Good. Why's the door open?"
"LORELAI: The door is open because. . .Dean's here."
"[Dean walks in]"
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: Hi."
"LORELAI: Um, Dean threw out a spider for me."
"DEAN: I just came by to drop off some of your stuff."
"RORY: Oh."
"DEAN: Just some books you loaned me, a couple of CD's."
"RORY: Okay, thanks."
"DEAN: Yeah, sure. Okay, so, I'm gonna go."
"LORELAI: Thanks Dean."
"[Dean leaves]"
"LORELAI: It was a really big spider. I think it had a g*n. What are you feeling right now?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: Not weirded out, even a little?"
"RORY: Why would I be weirded out?"
"LORELAI: Well, Dean coming over, bringing your stuff back."
"RORY: No, I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. Although, you know, if you were weirded out a little, it would be okay. It wouldn't mean that you don't like Jess, or that you made a mistake. It would just mean the guy who was in your life for two years isn't there anymore."
"RORY: I was just surprised, that's all."
"LORELAI: If you say so."
"RORY: I do."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: I'm gonna go start studying."
"LORELAI: I'll order the pizza."
"RORY: Thank you."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Jess are walking through the town square]"
"RORY: You know what just occurred to me? That we are very fortunate to have good teeth."
"JESS: Yes, very fortunate."
"RORY: Can you imagine if braces were involved in this interaction?"
"JESS: It'd be a bloodbath."
"RORY: I can't catch my breath."
"JESS: You're not supposed to."
"RORY: Hey, listen, Thursday night is the Stars Hollow High Winter Carnival."
"JESS: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Yeah, I thought we could go, meet Lane there."
"JESS: Nope."
"RORY: But it'd be really fun. They'll have really bad games and really bad food and the marching band will play and "
"JESS: Rory, I'm doing some of my best work here and you're just talking right through it."
"RORY: Come on, let's go to the carnival."
"JESS: I don't go to these stupid town things."
"RORY: You went to the Bid-A-Basket festival. You went to the dance marathon."
"JESS: That was when I was trying to get you. I now have you. That means I don't have to go anymore."
"RORY: You're serious?"
"JESS: As a heart attack."
"RORY: But it'll be fun."
"JESS: We can have our own fun."
"RORY: I can't miss the winter carnival."
"JESS: Rory, come on."
"RORY: Well, I never have. I can't. Just go with me, please."
"JESS: Look, how bout you go to the festival, meet Lane, and then I'll hook up with you afterwards."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: That's my final offer, man."
"RORY: Fine."
"JESS: Fine."
"RORY: We're gonna walk right in front of a car one of these days."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory and Jess walk in]"
"JESS: So, you want some help with your homework?"
"RORY: You're going to help me?"
"JESS: Yup."
"RORY: Don't take this the wrong way, but how?"
"JESS: Come upstairs and I'll show you."
"RORY: Upstairs?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: Well, you know how important my education is to me."
"JESS: Yes, I do."
"[Lorelai walks in with some shopping bags]"
"LORELAI: Rory, hey. Thank God, I need help. Where you going?"
"RORY: Nowhere."
"JESS: See ya. [goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Were you guys gonna go upstairs and kiss?"
"RORY: Wow, look at all the bags."
"LORELAI: Yes, I went shopping for my father's birthday present today, which was great for about fifteen minutes, until it all came back to me."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: The fact that I totally suck at buying my father presents."
"RORY: He'll like whatever you get him."
"LORELAI: If I slip him a quaalude, he'll like whatever I get him."
"RORY: They are not that bad."
"LORELAI: My intentions are always good, and I never put a price limit on it. I even went so far as to follow older men around the store who kind of looked like my dad to see what they were buying, which didn't help me with ideas, but I did get asked to the antique car show."
"RORY: Just show me what you got."
"LORELAI: Fine. Option number one  a state of the art, high tech, titanium bathroom scale."
"RORY: Huh."
"LORELAI: What? He has weight."
"RORY: Yes, but I'm not sure that his birthday is the time to remind him of it."
"LORELAI: Okay, option number two  a fabulous mechanical coin sorter. You put the coins in, it sorts them. What?"
"RORY: Well, it's a little generic."
"LORELAI: Generic in a good way, or. . ."
"RORY: What's the third option?"
"LORELAI: See, I should have pulled the coin sorter out last, cause. . ."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: A tie."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's silk."
"RORY: It's nice."
"LORELAI: It is?"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: It's a tie for my father's birthday."
"LUKE: What, no Aramis this year?"
"LORELAI: No, he likes ties."
"LUKE: You know, if you get the big bottle, it usually comes with a tote bag and a soap on a rope."
"LORELAI: Go away. My gifts suck."
"RORY: It's the thought that counts."
"LORELAI: What'd you get him?"
"RORY: Nothing big."
"LORELAI: Well, what?"
"RORY: Just a thing."
"LORELAI: What kind of thing?"
"RORY: Chuck Berry Live at the Fillmore on vinyl."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, that's perfect. He loves Chuck Berry. How did you come up with that?"
"RORY: I called him and asked him what he wanted."
"LORELAI: That's cheating."
"RORY: Tough."
"LORELAI: Well, now what am I gonna do? I can't give him a tie when you give him the world's most perfect present we already know he likes."
"RORY: You want me to go find something for you?"
"LORELAI: You would do that?"
"RORY: He gave me a couple other suggestions. I can go see if I can find one of them."
"LORELAI: Ugh, my God, I love you. You are my angel."
"RORY: Hey, you had one more that you didn't show me."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah  it lights up and sings."
"RORY: Enough said."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Rory is walking down the sidewalk. She stops to look in a store window, then accidentally bumps into Dean.]"
"RORY: Oh!"
"DEAN: Oh, sorry."
"RORY: I didn't see you."
"DEAN: I wasn't paying attention."
"RORY: I was just looking in the window and then. . ."
"DEAN: I was just noticing the new benches in the square."
"RORY: Sorry."
"DEAN: Yeah, uh, sorry."
"RORY: It's weird."
"DEAN: What's weird?"
"RORY: How we keep randomly bumping into each other like this."
"DEAN: Well, it wasn't exactly random bumping into you at your house."
"RORY: Right, I live there, not so random."
"DEAN: Though, this, right now. ."
"RORY: Random."
"DEAN: Very random."
"RORY: That's probably the most the word random's been used in a two minutes period in a really long time."
"DEAN: Hey, you wanna get a cup of coffee?"
"RORY: Coffee?"
"DEAN: Maybe talk a little? Of course, if you prefer, we can both just head over to Weston's and randomly bump into each other."
"RORY: No, uh, that's okay. I can get coffee."
"DEAN: Good."
"CUT TO WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Rory and Dean walk in]"
"DEAN: So, where do you wanna sit?"
"RORY: Um, there's good, if you like the window."
"DEAN: Window is fine."
"RORY: Of course, there's that one if you don't like the window."
"DEAN: Window's fine."
"RORY: The window can be colder because of the glass, but then that one is right by the bathroom, and being right by the bathroom always makes me kind of uncomfortable, which isn't really fair because something has to be right by the bathroom. Otherwise, you're cutting down on tables, which means you're cutting down on profits and. . .window's fine?"
"DEAN: Window's fine."
"RORY: Let's sit down then. [they sit down] This is a very nice table. Good pick."
"KIRK: Today we have an almond tort, an apple pandowdy, and various marzipan fruits made by a sect of cloistered nuns in Toledo."
"DEAN: I'll have a piece of pie."
"KIRK: Cherry, peach, chocolate, pumpkin, custard "
"DEAN: Custard's fine."
"KIRK: There's more."
"DEAN: I know, but custard's fine."
"KIRK: You don't wanna hear the rest?"
"DEAN: I am really good with the custard."
"KIRK: But they made memorize thirty different flavors."
"DEAN: Kirk?"
"KIRK: Yes?"
"DEAN: Custard is fine."
"KIRK: You want ice cream with that?"
"DEAN: Are there different flavors?"
"KIRK: Thirty-two."
"DEAN: Just the pie."
"KIRK: Okay. What about you?"
"RORY: Oh, nothing for me."
"DEAN: Nothing?"
"RORY: I'm not hungry."
"DEAN: You're not hungry?"
"RORY: Nope, I'm not."
"DEAN: She's not hungry."
"KIRK: I'll be right back."
"DEAN: In all the time I've known you, I've never seen you not hungry."
"RORY: Yeah, well. . ."
"DEAN: Thanks for doing this."
"RORY: Of course. Why wouldn't I?"
"DEAN: Because you're incredibly uncomfortable."
"RORY: Well, it's the situation, not you."
"DEAN: Yeah, the situation."
"RORY: You know, with you and me being. . ."
"DEAN: Yeah, yeah, I know the situation. So, um, how are ya?"
"RORY: I'm fine. You?"
"DEAN: I'm doing okay."
"RORY: How's school?"
"DEAN: Not bad. I've got McKellan for History."
"RORY: Oh, has he done his Napoleon having dinner with Charlemagne bit yet?"
"DEAN: Catherine the Great shows up for dessert."
"RORY: Oh, wow, he's revised it. Good for him. He's a unique man, but a decent teacher."
"DEAN: Yeah. You know, um, I wanted to tell you I applied to Southern Connecticut State."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: McKellan actually wrote me a letter of recommendation."
"RORY: Wait a minute  you do know that Southern Connecticut State is a four-year college?"
"DEAN: Yeah, I read that in the brochure."
"RORY: But what happened to I'm going to community college'?"
"DEAN: I changed my mind."
"RORY: Why?"
"DEAN: You."
"RORY: Me?"
"DEAN: All your Harvard talk, all those crazy books you pushed on me, all that talk about you can do more.'"
"RORY: You can do more."
"DEAN: So I decided to do more."
"RORY: Wow, I'm so glad."
"DEAN: Thanks."
"RORY: Well, if you need any help with anything, I've become the Rain Man of college application requirements."
"DEAN: Thanks. I might take you up on that."
"KIRK: Custard pie, no ice cream."
"DEAN: Thanks, Kirk."
"RORY: Wow. Southern Connecticut State, that's exciting. When did all this happen?"
"DEAN: The last few weeks. Uh, it's funny. I got the envelope, and I wanted to call you, and then I realized, uh, I can't do that."
"RORY: You could've done that."
"DEAN: I guess. I don't know, I can't get over how weird it is. I go from seeing you everyday to. . ."
"RORY: I know."
"DEAN: I mean, I'm used to talking to you."
"RORY: I know."
"DEAN: That's a hard thing to just let go of."
"RORY: For me, too."
"DEAN: I don't know, Rory. Maybe. . .maybe, um. . .is there a way we could be friends?"
"RORY: Really?"
"DEAN: If you want to."
"RORY: Oh, I want to. I really want to. But "
"DEAN: Don't ask me how I'm gonna deal with him. I have no idea."
"RORY: Okay."
"DEAN: Let's just take this one step at a time."
"RORY: Absolutely. Slow and steady wins the race."
"DEAN: This is really good. You sure you don't want a bite?"
"RORY: One bite. So how's Clara's horseback-riding lessons going?"
"DEAN: Not bad. I think she actually got within three feet of the thing last week."
"RORY: Hm, very impressive."
"DEAN: She thought so."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily and Richard are sitting in the living room for Richard's birthday party]"
"RICHARD: This man is a genius. Listen to him play."
"RORY: I'm glad you like it, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Oh, I must say, I am a very spoiled man. Chuck Berry, and the complete history of the Peloponnesian w*r."
"LORELAI: Well, sure, cause a partial history would skip all the dirty stuff."
"RICHARD: I especially like the way you wrapped the books in a bow tie. It's very, very clever."
"LORELAI: I thought it would be appropriate."
"EMILY: And, of course, you're not forgetting your favorite gift."
"RICHARD: Oh, yes, my beautiful humidor from my beautiful wife."
"EMILY: Thank you."
"RICHARD: No, thank you. It's been a wonderful birthday."
"[the doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: Would you like some more champagne?"
"RICHARD: Oh, why not?"
"TRIX: [from hallway] One of the porch lights is b*rned out. Perhaps the simple act of glancing outside a window once in awhile might have alerted someone to the situation."
"LORELAI: Gran?"
"RICHARD: Trix, is that you? Well, I'll be. What a surprise. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Mom, did you know Grandma was coming?"
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Okay, no seems like a safe answer."
"RICHARD: [from hallway] Emily, come here! Come say hello to this delightful creature that just walked in."
"EMILY: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: Come on, let's see if she tries to make a break for it."
"[they all walk to the front hallway where Richard is standing with Trix]"
"RICHARD: Emily, did you know about this?"
"EMILY: Why, no, I didn't."
"RICHARD: Well, I'm floored."
"TRIX: Good. Hello Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hello Gran, good to see you."
"TRIX: You're well?"
"LORELAI: I'm well."
"TRIX: You're working?"
"LORELAI: I'm working."
"TRIX: You're single?"
"LORELAI: I'm single."
"TRIX: By choice, or do you scare the men with your independence?"
"LORELAI: Actually, I scare them with my Minnie Pearl impression."
"TRIX: The lady with the hat. Rory, as soon as I get settled, I want to hear all about your schooling and your college plans."
"RORY: Okay, Gran."
"TRIX: Well, Emily, I don't know if you realize it or not, but it's not proper to receive guests in the foyer. It puts one in the awkward position of having to invite oneself in."
"EMILY: Uh, yes, uh, please, I - I'm sorry. Please, come in."
"RICHARD: This way. [Richard leads her to the living room]"
"EMILY: What is she doing here?"
"LORELAI: She's visiting."
"EMILY: She didn't call, she always calls."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's Dad's birthday. She wanted it to be a surprise."
"EMILY: But I haven't prepared. I haven't shopped or set up the guest room and  oh God, her horrible gifts are still in the basement. What do I do?"
"LORELAI: Leave them there."
"EMILY: But "
"LORELAI: It's too late to do anything about that now. Come on."
"[they walk to the living room]"
"TRIX: Oh, Emily, you're still here."
"EMILY: Yes, of course I'm still here. Can I get you some champagne?"
"TRIX: Well, if you wish me to be violently ill tomorrow, absolutely."
"LORELAI: Do not answer that."
"RICHARD: I've got you covered Trix. Now, tell me what on earth you're doing here. You didn't travel all the way from England just for my birthday."
"TRIX: Oh, I think your birthday is a good enough reason to travel all the way from England. However, it did also happen to coincide with some business I needed to attend to."
"RORY: What kind of business?"
"TRIX: Well, for the past year, I've been renting my home in Hartford to a group of musicians. They've recently moved out, so I had to come check on the house and secure a new tenant."
"LORELAI: What kind of musicians?"
"TRIX: A rock and roll group of some sort. I believe they call themselves Korn."
"LORELAI: You rented your house to Korn?"
"RORY: That's so cool!"
"TRIX: They were fine tenants. Took wonderful care of the place. They planted some lovely tulips in the front yard."
"EMILY: So, Mom, if you're going to be here for awhile, I can plan some things for you to do, some outings you might enjoy."
"TRIX: Like what?"
"EMILY: Like the arboretum."
"TRIX: I have no desire to spend the entire day with plants, Emily. I'm not a bee. Besides, I already know what I would like to do. I would like to see where Lorelai works."
"LORELAI: The inn?"
"TRIX: I thought we could all have dinner there."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, sure. That would be great."
"TRIX: Wonderful. Tomorrow night, then."
"RORY: Oh. . ."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"TRIX: What?"
"LORELAI: It's just that tomorrow night we were planning to go to this winter carnival at the high school. . ."
"RORY: But we can skip it."
"TRIX: Absolutely not. Rory, you're a young person who works hard. It's equally important to have fun. You go to the carnival."
"RORY: Thank you."
"TRIX: Lorelai, you've had enough fun in your life."
"LORELAI: And then some."
"TRIX: Dinner will be for the grown-ups. Now, how is the birthday going?"
"RICHARD: Wonderfully. They're spoiling me rotten. Emily got me the most beautiful humidor. It's from 1917, and was owned by a lieutenant in World w*r I."
"TRIX: You know, your father had a humidor that was owned by Victor Hugo."
"RICHARD: Really?"
"TRIX: I still have it if you'd like it."
"RICHARD: Well, I'd love it."
"TRIX: Fine. I'll take care of it as soon as I get back to London. Now, if you will excuse me, I should like to freshen up."
"EMILY: I'll make sure the guest room's ready."
"RICHARD: Oh, I can do that, Emily."
"TRIX: Thank you, Richard. Emily, I expect to return in twenty minutes. That should give you enough time to pull my gifts out of storage and place them around the room as if they actually stand there all year. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: You want some help with those gifts?"
"EMILY: Yes, please."

"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"SOOKIE: Twelve courses, each paired with a specific wine, and for dessert, individual chocolate amaretto mousse cakes in the shape of a G."
"LORELAI: Sookie, look what you've done."
"SOOKIE: Over the top?"
"LORELAI: On a monumental scale."
"SOOKIE: Exactly what I was going for. I'm also going to have individual little menus printed up and placed at each setting."
"LORELAI: I love you for doing this."
"[Michel walks up to Lorelai with the phone]"
"MICHEL: Your mother is on the phone."
"LORELAI: Oh, can you take a message?"
"MICHEL: You mean, do I have the physical and mental capabilities to take a message? Why, yes, I do, however. . ."
"LORELAI: I got it. [takes the phone] Hey Mom."
"EMILY: She wants to see your house."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Tonight, before the dinner."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay."
"EMILY: Okay? Did you hear what I said? That horrifying woman wants to see your house. Your house  the one with the monkey lamp."
"LORELAI: Mom, relax."
"EMILY: Is it clean?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's clean."
"EMILY: If I came in there wearing white gloves, what would I find?"
"LORELAI: That you could pull a rabbit out of your hat?"
"EMILY: I don't know what to do. Oh, nevermind, I'll just figure it out when I get there."
"LORELAI: When you get where?"
"EMILY: I'll call you later, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: When you get where, Mom?"
"EMILY: I'm turning onto your street now."
"LORELAI: Mom, no!"
"EMILY: I'll just let myself in. I know you keep a key in the turtle or some ridiculous thing like that."
"LORELAI: Mom, I beg of you, make a very dangerous u-turn right now and go back where you came from."
"EMILY: I'm here. I'll talk to you later, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom. . .mom!"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Rory walks past a classroom as Francie opens the door]"
"FRANCIE: Oh, Rory, super. Could you step in here for a sec?"
"RORY: Oh, okay."
"FRANCIE: Thanks. I'm just so lucky I caught you."
"RORY: What is this?"
"FRANCIE: The supplementary student council meeting, silly."
"RORY: But Paris canceled that."
"FRANCIE: She did, didn't she? Hm."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LOUISE: You tell us."
"RORY: I don't know."
"MADELINE: Francie said there was an issue that has to be discussed."
"LOUISE: We figured you ok'ed it."
"RORY: I did not okay it. Mr. Hunter, there's been a mistake. Paris canceled this meeting and "
"MR. HUNTER: I know, Rory, but Francie approached me and said there was an issue that she had planned to discuss at the meeting today, and it has a bit of a ticking clock on it."
"RORY: You did not mention that you had anything."
"FRANCIE: I was just so surprised that Paris was canceling the meeting that it flew right out of my head. It was New York to London in three hours or less."
"RORY: I'll bet."
"MR. HUNTER: Rory, if you take a seat, we can get started."
"RORY: I move that we postpone this meeting until Paris can be reached."
"MR. HUNTER: We're all here now, let's just hear what Francie has to say. You can fill Paris in later. By the way, did anyone try to find her?"
"FRANCIE: I saw her walking off with. . .who was that, her brother?"
"LOUISE: Paris doesn't have a brother."
"FRANCIE: Really? Well, she certainly seemed to know him."
"RORY: Francie, why don't you just tell us all why we're here?"
"LOUISE: And how long we're staying."
"FRANCIE: The Wadsworth Mansion has just had a cancellation, which means that we can get it for prom, if we move quickly. Shall we vote?"
"RORY: Hold on  the Wadsworth Mansion is too expensive. We've already discussed this."
"FRANCIE: There are plenty of funds there to cover it."
"RORY: Not if we want a telescope to be the senior gift."
"FRANCIE: You mean, not if Paris wants a telescope to be the senior gift."
"RORY: We all thought it was a good idea."
"FRANCIE: Reach for the stars? Nice theme, original. Was Be all that you can be' taken?"
"RORY: It's a good gift."
"FRANCIE: It's a fine gift. However, so is planting a nice tree in the quad."
"RORY: Every class plants a tree."
"FRANCIE: Well, then, who are we to judge those who came before? I say, let's put it to a vote."
"RORY: This isn't right. Paris should be here."
"FRANCIE: I agree, Paris should be here. However, she's not, so once again, shall we vote?"
"MR. HUNTER: Rory, as student body vice president, I need you to call for a vote."
"RORY: All those in favor of using the funds for the Wadsworth Mansion, even though we will be cheating the next generation of Chilton students who would love a nice telescope, say aye."
"ALL: Aye."
"RORY: Wadsworth Mansion it is."
"FRANCIE: Meeting dismissed. Chin up, we'll make it a really big tree."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai pulls up to the house and goes inside. Emily is trying to move Lorelai's couch]"
"LORELAI: Hold it right there! Step back and move away from the couch."
"EMILY: This couch cannot stay."
"LORELAI: Yes, it can."
"EMILY: It's awful."
"LORELAI: It can hear you."
"EMILY: Please."
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Well, what about the chair? Let me move the chair."
"LORELAI: No, the chair stays also."
"EMILY: Well, we have to do something. I brought flowers over and can't find a decent vase. All I could find was a ceramic Betty Boop head."
"LORELAI: Mom, you're making yourself crazy."
"EMILY: I know. We'll get some tarps and throw them over everything and tell her that you're painting."
"LORELAI: Mom, stop it. What is so horrible about this room?"
"EMILY: Well, look at it."
"LORELAI: I am. I like it."
"EMILY: Well, you may like it, but your grandmother will not. She's going to take one look around here at the junk store collection of hobo furniture and she's going to blame me."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"EMILY: For letting you live like this. For not teaching you better. For not redecorating while you're out of town."
"LORELAI: Well, we're never out of town."
"EMILY: For not sending you out of town so I could redecorate!"
"LORELAI: Mom, you don't believe that."
"EMILY: Everything that's wrong in your life is my fault. Everything that's wrong in your father's life is my fault. Basically, everything's that wrong is my fault."
"LORELAI: Mom, would you sit down for a minute."
"[They both sit on the couch]"
"EMILY: And it's lumpy, perfect."
"LORELAI: Mom, if I may, I'd like to give you some advice."
"EMILY: You would?"
"LORELAI: You need to develop a defense mechanism for dealing with Grandma."
"EMILY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: You just need a system, a new mindset. Take me, for example."
"EMILY: What about you?"
"LORELAI: Well, I know there are many things in my life you don't approve of."
"EMILY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: Like this couch."
"EMILY: Well, this couch is terrible."
"LORELAI: Okay, good  you think the couch is terrible. Now, at one point in my life, you saying a couch that I carefully picked out and had to pay off over eight months is terrible might've hurt my feelings, but not anymore."
"EMILY: No?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because one day, I decided that instead of being hurt and upset by your disapproval, I'm gonna be amused. I'm gonna find it funny. I'm even going to take a little bit of pleasure in it."
"EMILY: You take pleasure in my disapproval?"
"LORELAI: I encourage it sometimes just for a laugh."
"EMILY: I don't know what to think of that."
"LORELAI: Think, hey, that's brilliant', because this idea could set you free."
"[Emily sighs]"
"LORELAI: Mom, what are you thinking about?"
"EMILY: That ridiculous Betty Boop head."
"LORELAI: [smiles] Mmhmm. So am I."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Francie is walking down the hall when Rory pulls her into the bathroom]"
"RORY: Francie, so good of you to stop by. I know how busy you are. Gum?"
"FRANCIE: What's your damage, Gilmore?"
"RORY: Damage? No damage. I just thought we should chat."
"FRANCIE: Yeah? Well, I don't have any"
"RORY: Oh, you know what, I changed my mind. I don't think we should chat, I think I should chat. Ready? Okay. That little stunt you pulled  not good."
"FRANCIE: Stunt?"
"RORY: Paris canceled that meeting."
"FRANCIE: Something came up."
"RORY: Then you should have brought it to Paris."
"FRANCIE: Paris wasn't around. She was off yet again with the mystery man."
"RORY: Jealous?"
"FRANCIE: Of Paris' lobotomy victim? I think not."
"RORY: What is wrong with you? So what if Paris has a boyfriend? You don't think that as hard as Paris works in school or on the Franklin or on student council - you don't think that she deserves to have a boyfriend and to enjoy it?"
"FRANCIE: Hey, no one is denying Gidget a chance to snag Moondoggie for the clambake, but the rest of us have things to accomplish."
"RORY: You've had one goal since the beginning of the year."
"FRANCIE: To achieve the perfect liquid line."
"RORY: To take Paris down."
"FRANCIE: And to achieve the perfect liquid line."
"RORY: I tried to intervene, I tried to smooth the path between both sides, but you know what? That's over."
"FRANCIE: Oh, it is?"
"RORY: Yes, it is. I'm finished being your go-between. You're a jerk, and if you wanna play it this way, then fine. All bets are off. I'm no longer your ally. You wanna play rough  fine. I've read The Art of w*r. I can be just as big a pain in your butt as you are in Paris', capiche?"
"FRANCIE: You do not wanna be my enemy, Marlo Thomas."
"RORY: I think I do, Tina Louise."
"FRANCIE: Fine."
"RORY: It is fine."
"FRANCIE: Can I go now?"
"RORY: The door's right there."
"FRANCIE: You're gonna be very sorry."
"RORY: Am I?"
"FRANCIE: Oh yes. . .you are."
"RORY: I'm good with that."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai is upstairs, Rory's in her bedroom. They holler back and forth to each other off-screen]"
"RORY: I'm running out of space."
"LORELAI: How many bouquets you got left?"
"RORY: Three."
"LORELAI: Can you put them on your dresser?"
"RORY: Dresser's full."
"LORELAI: Can you squish them in with another bunch?"
"RORY: Already squished."
"LORELAI: Can you toss them out the window like I did my last five bouquets?"
"RORY: Done."
"LORELAI: Great."
"[Lorelai walks down the stairs as Rory walks to the living room]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so monkey lamp's in the closet, singing rabbi's in a drawer, and all Spice Girl memorabilia's under your bed. How do I look?"
"RORY: Like a woman who does not own any Spice Girl memorabilia."
"LORELAI: You look pretty, too."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: And I want a play-by-play of the carnival tonight."
"RORY: I promise."
"LORELAI: And you can leave out all the "
"RORY: Hand kissing sounds, gladly."
"[there's a knock at the front door]"
"LORELAI: Oop, they're here."
"RORY: Hey, if she doesn't like the house  what happens then?"
"LORELAI: I think we have to move. Smile pretty."
"[they open the door]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom, hi Dad, hi Gran. Was your trip good?"
"TRIX: The trip was fine. Hello Rory."
"RORY: Hi Gran. Hi Grandma, hi Grandpa."
"TRIX: Now that we've exhausted the greetings, kindly move aside. I'd like to see your house."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on in."
"EMILY: If I pass out. . ."
"LORELAI: I'll yell timber. So, Gran, what do you think? I mean, it's not much. Probably too modest for Korn, but Weezer'd be pretty comfortable."
"[Gran walks around silently exploring the main floor of the house as the others follow behind her. They follow her back to the living room.]"
"TRIX: Let's go."
"RORY: Are we moving?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"EMILY: Lorelai, I swear to God, if you prolong this evening. . ."
"LORELAI: Coming."
"RORY: Have fun."
"EMILY: No one appreciates your sarcasm, young lady."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory and Jess walk down the sidewalk]"
"RORY: Boy, it's pretty out tonight, isn't it?"
"JESS: Sure is."
"RORY: Like a snow globe."
"JESS: Mmhmm."
"RORY: Sparkly. I mean, I don't think a night comes any prettier than this one. And if you take a really pretty night and add a corndog. . ."
"JESS: I'm not going to that carnival with you."
"RORY: Why not?"
"JESS: I will be in front of Miss Patty's at nine as promised."
"RORY: You are stubborn and impossible."
"JESS: See you at nine."
"[Dean and his sister walk toward them]"
"CLARA: Rory!"
"RORY: Clara, hi!"
"CLARA: I haven't seen you in forever."
"RORY: Longer than forever."
"DEAN: She got away from me."
"JESS: Buy a stronger leash."
"DEAN: Hey, uh, did you see they got the crazy psychic from Woodbury again?"
"RORY: You're kidding. I thought she got arrested."
"DEAN: She's out now and sitting right over there."
"RORY: I love her. She always tells me I'm gonna be rich and famous."
"DEAN: She tells everybody that they're gonna be rich and famous."
"CLARA: Who are you?"
"JESS: No one."
"CLARA: Yes, you are."
"JESS: No, I'm not."
"RORY: That's Jess. Jess, this is Clara."
"CLARA: Are you guys going to the carnival?"
"RORY: I'm going, Jess isn't."
"CLARA: Why not?"
"RORY: He has things to do."
"CLARA: Then you can go with me and Dean, right?"
"RORY: Oh, well. . ."
"JESS: I'm going."
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: To the carnival. I'm going to the carnival."
"CLARA: I thought you had things to do."
"JESS: Well, I don't."
"CLARA: Rory just said you had things to do."
"JESS: Hey Tatu, just look at the plane, will ya?"
"CLARA: What?"
"RORY: Jess, you don't have to go. We can meet later like you said."
"JESS: What? No. Come on, how many chances does a guy have to go to a Stars Hollow High winter carnival, right?"
"CLARA: Right."
"JESS: Okay, then. Let's go."
"CLARA: To the carnival!"
"JESS: To the carnival."
"CLARA: I want a pretzel and a snowcone and a cheese stick. . ."
"DEAN: Pace yourself."
"CLARA: Rory never tells me to pace myself."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai, Emily, Richard, and Trix walk into the dining room]"
"LORELAI: And this is our dining room."
"TRIX: Small."
"LORELAI: Or quaint."
"TRIX: Touche."
"RICHARD: Oh, you're in for a real treat, Trix. This Sookie is one of the best chefs around."
"LORELAI: Here's our table, Gran. Why don't you sit here?"
"TRIX: All right. Well, Lorelai, I must say, on first viewing, this little inn of yours looks quite impressive."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"TRIX: I mean, it's certainly no arboretum, but it's nice just the same."
"EMILY: It was just a suggestion, Mom."
"TRIX: Yes, it was. Oh, look, a menu."
"RICHARD: Well, that's a nice little touch."
"LORELAI: Well, Sookie wanted everything perfect for tonight."
"MICHEL: Hey, there you are."
"LORELAI: Oh, Michel, great. Gran, I'd like you to meet Michel Gerard, our concierge. Michel, this is my grandmother, Lorelai."
"MICHEL: Very pleased to meet you."
"TRIX: Do you have a pen?"
"MICHEL: Uh, why, of course."
"TRIX: Now, please take this to your chef. These are the times I would like each course to appear at this table. I like a brisk pace, twelve minutes per course is best for my digestion. However, please tell your servers that they are not to clear until everyone has finished. Thank you."
"MICHEL: Oh, no, thank you. It is so rare that I get to carry a note anymore."
"CUT TO CARNIVAL"
"CLARA: Is Jess your real name?"
"JESS: Yes."
"CLARA: Do you like it?"
"JESS: It's fine."
"CLARA: Would you rather be named Bill?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Frank?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Mike?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Bob?"
"JESS: No."
"CLARA: Ed?"
"JESS: Does this belong to you?"
"DEAN: Clara, you want a snowcone?"
"CLARA: Yes. Will you go get me a snowcone?"
"JESS: Absolutely. Go stand in the middle of the street and wait for me, I'll be right back."
"DEAN: I'll get your snowcone."
"CLARA: And one for Rory, too."
"DEAN: And one for Rory, too."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Dean walks away]"
"CLARA: Do you wash your hair?"
"JESS: Yes, I wash my hair."
"CLARA: Then why does it stick up like that?"
"JESS: Because."
"CLARA: It looks crazy."
"LANE: Rory!"
"[Rory walks over to Lane's booth]"
"RORY: Hey, how's the fundraiser going? The turnout looks good."
"LANE: The turnout's great. Apparently, people are starved for entertainment around here."
"RORY: Well, hurrah for bad cable reception."
"LANE: So, I'm sorry, but did I just see you with Jess and Dean, or do I need a new prescription?"
"RORY: Your prescription's fine."
"LANE: So explain."
"RORY: Tomorrow at Luke's. I need to get back before there's a more exciting ending to the evening."
"LANE: Forget nothing."
"RORY: I promise."
"[Rory walks back to Jess and Clara. Jess is playing the Bottle Toss game]"
"CLARA: You missed. You missed. You missed."
"JESS: Hey, you wanna learn how to fly?"
"RORY: How's everybody doing?"
"CLARA: Jess can't throw."
"JESS: I can, too."
"CLARA: You missed every time."
"JESS: I can't concentrate with your annoying midget voice yammering on and on. It's like having Stuart Little shoved in my ear."
"[Dean walks over and hands Rory and Clara each a snowcone]"
"DEAN: Here. They only had cherry."
"RORY: Oh, that's all we need."
"DEAN: So, you play any of the games yet?"
"CLARA: Nope, I've been watching him lose. You don't get a bear, but it's still pretty fun."
"DEAN: Well, how about I go b*at you at ice bowling?"
"CLARA: You can't b*at me."
"DEAN: Oh, I think I can."
"CLARA: Let's go!"
"DEAN: We'll be back."
"RORY: Okay. So, how much to play?"
"JESS: A dollar."
"RORY: Okay."
"JESS: I got it."
"RORY: Just for the record, I'm a girl and we are supposed to throw like this."
"JESS: So you got anything you wanna tell me?"
"RORY: I like your crazy hair."
"JESS: You weren't just gonna go to the carnival with Dean?"
"RORY: No. Running into them was a total coincidence. I swear."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Not even close."
"JESS: So when did you and Dean get so buddy-buddy again?"
"RORY: We're not so buddy-buddy."
"JESS: Last time I checked, you weren't even speaking. Now he's fetching you snowcones?"
"RORY: He was getting one for Clara."
"JESS: You guys talking?"
"RORY: No, we're not talking. We talked, once."
"JESS: You got my interest."
"RORY: We ran into each other and he wanted to get coffee, so I did, and we talked."
"JESS: About?"
"RORY: Just boring things. Clara's horseback riding, his college application, nothing earth shattering."
"JESS: Uh huh."
"RORY: And he asked if we could be friends, and I said sure."
"JESS: Friends?"
"RORY: Jess, he knows we're together, okay? And it's a small town. Dean and I will see it each other, and I just thought it wouldn't hurt to be polite."
"JESS: So you're just being polite?"
"RORY: Yes. Dean has never done anything bad to me, and I just, I want to "
"JESS: I got it."
"RORY: You're mad."
"JESS: Nope, just figured you could've told me."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"JESS: No biggie. You gonna throw that?"
"RORY: You're really not mad?"
"JESS: Nope, not mad at all."
"RORY: And you understand?"
"JESS: I understand."
"RORY: And you believe me?"
"JESS: Like you're standing with an ax next to a cherry tree."
"RORY: And you're okay with it?"
"JESS: Will you just throw the ball?"
"RORY: Oh my God, I did it!"
"JESS: Very impressive."
"BOY: Here you go, congratulations. [hands her a stuffed bear]"
"RORY: Thanks. Hello sad, pathetic bear."
"JESS: You know, I could've bought you that thing for a quarter."
"RORY: No, it's better that I won it. Maybe Clara would like it."
"JESS: Yes, shoved in her mouth."
"RORY: She's cute."
"JESS: Oh, just darling."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"RICHARD: And so far, knock wood, things seem to be picking up."
"TRIX: Well, it's about time you went into business. Oh, Emily, you should've encouraged him to do this years ago."
"EMILY: Yes, I should've."
"TRIX: He's a go-getter, your father. Not completely dissimilar to yourself."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Gran."
"[Sookie walks over to them]"
"SOOKIE: Hello. Just wanted to check and see how your dinner was coming along."
"LORELAI: Sookie, it's amazing. Gran, this is our chef, Sookie."
"TRIX: The food is excellent."
"SOOKIE: Thank you very much."
"TRIX: Young lady, your uniform has a large cut down the middle of your back."
"SOOKIE: It does? Oh yeah, I did get myself, huh."
"EMILY: Sookie, how on earth did you do that?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, well, I. . . and the  the chop flew, so I lunged. . .and then the floor slipped. . . and then. . .ooh! You know, and I just. . .did a flip, ya know. I guess you just kind of had to be there."
"TRIX: Yes, apparently so."
"SOOKIE: Okay, well, nice to meet you. I have to get back. We have quite a tight schedule to follow."
"TRIX: Yes, we do."
"[Sookie walks away]"
"RICHARD: So, Trix, let's talk about the Hartford house. Do you have a new tenant lined up yet?"
"TRIX: Yes, I do."
"RICHARD: Hmm. Who?"
"TRIX: Me."
"EMILY: What?"
"TRIX: I wasn't going to bring this up tonight, but since you asked, my health hasn't been too good lately."
"RICHARD: What, what's the matter?"
"TRIX: What the matter is, I'm not twenty. Anyhow, the weather in London is quite damp, and I have a yearning to be a little closer to my immediate family, so now that Korn has moved out of my house, I thought perhaps I would move back in."
"LORELAI: Um, when, Gran?"
"TRIX: As soon as I can close up the London house and get my affairs in order."
"RICHARD: Well, I think that's a wonderful idea. I'm thrilled. In fact, I'm so thrilled, I'm not going to be angry with you for not telling me you were in ill health."
"TRIX: I will be fine, Richard."
"RICHARD: You will be fine, because as soon as you're back here, I'm going to send you to the finest doctors."
"TRIX: Whatever you say."
"RICHARD: And Emily and I are going to look after you completely, day and night. You can count on us."
"TRIX: I knew I could. Oh, it's time for the next course. Waiter, our next course please."
"EMILY: I'm not done."
"TRIX: What do you mean, you're not done? You had twelve minutes."
"EMILY: I'm not done."
"TRIX: Fine, we will wait."
"[Emily begins to slowly eat the rest of her meal]"
"LORELAI: That'll do, pig. That'll do."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[Dean is reading a bulletin board in the hallway]"
"JESS: Need some help with the big words?"
"DEAN: Sure. Why don't you come over here and I'll show you which one's giving me a hard time."
"JESS: You're getting a little pathetic man."
"DEAN: Thanks for the heads up."
"JESS: Let's be friends?"
"DEAN: No thanks."
"JESS: You don't think I know what you're doing? You don't think it's so pathetically transparent?"
"DEAN: Get out of here, Jess."
"JESS: Rory's taking pity on you. That's why the sudden interest in being your friend. You know that?"
"DEAN: Whatever you say."
"JESS: The saddest part of this whole thing is. . ."
"DEAN: Man, you like hearing yourself talk."
"JESS: You really think that by being her friend, you're gonna get her back."
"DEAN: I don't know what you're talking about."
"JESS: No, huh?"
"DEAN: Rory and I are just friends, just like you and Rory were just friends. And hey, look how it turned out for you."
"[Clara walks out of the bathroom]"
"CLARA: Okay, I'm ready for popcorn."
"DEAN: You got it."
"CLARA: Bye Jess. You think Rory wants some popcorn?"
"DEAN: I don't know. Let's go ask her."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the front porch]"
"RORY: This is very impressive."
"LORELAI: Not as impressive as my mother making four green beans last an hour and a half."
"RORY: I wish I'd seen that."
"LORELAI: When she finally got to the last bean, she cut it in six pieces. I swear, I thought Gran was gonna lunge across the table at her."
"RORY: The student surpasses the master."
"LORELAI: I was a little proud. Although I'm bummed I missed the carnival."
"RORY: There's a snowcone in the freezer for you."
"LORELAI: How'd it finally end with Cheech and Chong?"
"RORY: Jess knows I'm friends with Dean, Dean knows I'm dating Jess, and they both seem fine with it. What?"
"LORELAI: I just like that once in awhile, you still seem like a little kid."
"RORY: They do, I swear."
"LORELAI: Let's just watch the snow."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The maid opens the door for Lorelai and Rory]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MAID: Good evening. May I take your coats?"
"LORELAI: Oh, sure, thanks."
"EMILY: [from living room] That's the most absurd thing I've ever heard."
"MAID: Your mother's in the living room."
"LORELAI: So last chance to run, huh?"
"MAID: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Just ignore her."
"[They walk to the living room. Emily is talking on the phone and doesn't see them come in]"
"EMILY: Of course I said it. Well, I can't imagine who would take jackbooted as a compliment. I will not apologize. Every time she went to the pantry, I thought she was marching on Poland. Oh, I see, because I want things a certain way, I'm unreasonable?"
"[Lorelai pours herself a glass of wine]"
"RORY: Shh!"
"EMILY: Why, that is the most absurd. . .I want to see this document. Fax it to me immediately."
"LORELAI: Fax it to me immediately?"
"RORY: She's part of the electronic age."
"EMILY: Tomorrow morning is completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable because I'm paying you three hundred dollars an hour. So turn that little near-luxury car around, go back to your office, and fax me that libelous scrap of paper."
"LORELAI: Ask him if he can pick up some ice cream, too."
"EMILY: Well, tell your wife to tape your daughter's recital. [hangs up] Unbelievable."
"[Emily turns around and sees Lorelai and Rory on the couch]"
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"RORY: Hi Grandma."
"EMILY: When did you two get here?"
"LORELAI: Sometime between the second absurd and the third unbelievable."
"EMILY: I apologize. That call caught me off guard."
"RORY: Is everything all right, Grandma?"
"EMILY: Everything's fine."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"EMILY: I'm sure."
"LORELAI: You look peeved."
"EMILY: I'm not peeved."
"LORELAI: Well, you look peeved."
"EMILY: Kindly stop making me say the word peeved."
"LORELAI: Mom, spill it. What's wrong?"
"EMILY: That was our lawyer calling to inform me that one of our former maids is suing for wrongful termination."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"EMILY: You might at least act surprised."
"LORELAI: It's not the first time, is it?"
"EMILY: It most certainly is."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"EMILY: Yes, Lorelai, really."
"LORELAI: Well, then, I'm surprised."
"EMILY: It's beyond surprising, it's outrageous."
"RORY: What did Grandpa say?"
"EMILY: Your Grandfather's still in London helping his mother close down her house. Of course he'd be gone when this happens."
"LORELAI: I think he planned it that way."
"RORY: Which maid was it?"
"EMILY: Gerta, the one from Hamburg, Germany."
"LORELAI: Which one was she?"
"RORY: You remember  she was the one you made all those Hamburg/hamburger jokes to."
"LORELAI: God, I b*at that dead horse."
"RORY: With glee."
"EMILY: She was the clomper."
"LORELAI: The clomper?"
"EMILY: She'd be upstairs making the beds and it'd sound like a Munich beer hall rally."
"LORELAI: That's why you fired her?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Because she made noise when she walked?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Was she a good maid otherwise?"
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Besides the clomping, was she polite, on time, made sure the little fork went on the outside?"
"EMILY: Have you been listening to me? She was not performing her duties as I wished them to be performed. Everything else is beside the point."
"LORELAI: Well, I guess it's always something, isn't it?"
"EMILY: What's that supposed to mean?"
"LORELAI: It means you always seem to find the one thing about a maid that negates all of her good qualities. I mean, at a certain point, isn't it just easier to let a couple things slide?"
"EMILY: I see. So it's my fault?"
"LORELAI: I didn't say that."
"EMILY: No, Lorelai, you did. For years, I've been listening to you and your father and everyone else go on and on about how demanding I am, how I have to have things a certain way. Well, guess what? I pay to have them that way. I pay more than anyone else pays their maids, and when things are not the way I want, that means I'm not getting what I paid for. Why is that so hard to understand?"
"LORELAI: It isn't hard to understand, it's just "
"EMILY: If you pay for first class and the airline sticks you in coach, people expect you to be upset. No one calls you demanding or unreasonable. And yet here is this woman whom I pay more than she can get anywhere else in Hartford, whose severance package could finance a summer cruise down the Rhine, dragging me into court saying that I was unfair. Why? Because having paid for one thing, I'm not content with something else? That makes me unfair? Well, then, so be it. Let someone else pay first class and ride in steerage, not me."
"MAID: Excuse me, Mrs. Gilmore, dinner's ready"
"EMILY: Thank you, Brooke, we'll be right there."
"[Brooke walks away; Lorelai and Rory start to get up]"
"EMILY: Wait, wait, wait. Do you hear that?"
"LORELAI: Hear what?"
"EMILY: Exactly."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai is watching Sookie and Jackson argue]"
"SOOKIE: You know, next time I want some grapefruit, I'm just gonna ask for a kazoo because you can only seem to get me the most bizarre opposite."
"JACKSON: What is your problem?"
"[Michel walks in]"
"MICHEL: I need you to "
"LORELAI: Shh!"
"MICHEL: What? Oh, it started. You were supposed to call me."
"LORELAI: Stop talking."
"JACKSON: I understand perfectly. You wanna be a dictator."
"SOOKIE: Oh, come off it."
"JACKSON: Commandant St. James says, ""Brussels sprouts! You will bring me the Brussels sprouts."""
"SOOKIE: I'm trying to plan a menu here, Jackson!"
"MICHEL: Fill me in, please."
"LORELAI: Jackson brought pea tendrils instead of Brussels sprouts."
"MICHEL: Well, aren't we Evil Knievel?"
"LORELAI: Coffee?"
"MICHEL: Oh, please."
"SOOKIE: Pea tendrils are too delicate to serve with the lamb shank!"
"JACKSON: I don't think that they are."
"SOOKIE: Where are the Brussels sprouts?"
"JACKSON: I looked at the stalks, they weren't good enough."
"SOOKIE: You always do this to me."
"JACKSON: Doesn't it matter that I care so much about the quality of the produce that I sell you that I'd be willing to risk an enormous argument just to save your dinner."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Oops, that was dumb."
"SOOKIE: Save my dinner?"
"JACKSON: You know what I meant."
"SOOKIE: Yes, my dinner is out standing on a ledge. Oh no! What's gonna happen?"
"JACKSON: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Oh wait! What's that? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Super Jackson and his atomic pea tendrils!"
"JACKSON: You wanna get another produce guy?"
"SOOKIE: Maybe I should!"
"JACKSON: Well, go ahead!"
"SOOKIE: Don't tempt me!"
"JACKSON: That's it, I am leaving."
"SOOKIE: Go! And take the tendrils with you!"
"JACKSON: Fine! See you tonight?"
"SOOKIE: I love you."
"LORELAI: And it always ends with a hug."
"MICHEL: Hm."
"LORELAI: Okay, what do you need?"
"MICHEL: The new insurance policies you ordered."
"LORELAI: Good. Now the inspector's supposed to be coming by to check the place out tomorrow, so you're gonna have to show him around."
"MICHEL: What?"
"LORELAI: You're covering for me, remember?"
"MICHEL: Oh, yes, that's right. Tomorrow the two of you go back to school."
"LORELAI: It's not school, it's a one-day course at the learning center."
"SOOKIE: How to run an inn."
"MICHEL: Yes, amazing you've been able to fake it so long."
"LORELAI: This is specific to opening small inns, bed and breakfasts."
"MICHEL: I see. Order half of everything. There  you owe me seventy-five dollars."
"LORELAI: Why are you being such a snob about this? You went to hotel school."
"MICHEL: I attended the Ecole Hôtelière de Genève."
"LORELAI: Wow, that's gotta make one hell of a sweatshirt."
"MICHEL: It was one of the premiere hotel schools in the world. You two, on the other hand, are going to take a two-hour course at the Radisson."
"SOOKIE: Jackson's taken a lot of courses through The Learning Center and he loves it. He took beekeeping "
"LORELAI: Jackson keeps bees?"
"SOOKIE: No, it turned out he was allergic. One stung his lip and his whole head blew up to three times his normal size."
"MICHEL: Please tell me you have pictures."
"SOOKIE: He also took a course in how to buy foreclosed real estate, and how to write a diary."
"LORELAI: How do you not know how to write a diary?"
"SOOKIE: He's a searcher."
"LORELAI: Yes, he is."
"SOOKIE: Plus, I think he was really lonely before we got together and he didn't live near a good bar."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, I predict that tomorrow will be a complete waste of time and money, and I will be here to laugh at you when you return."
"LORELAI: Thanks for your support. Forget him. Opening our own is a huge step, and anything that might help is worth trying."
"SOOKIE: Exactly partner."
"LORELAI: Now tell me you got pictures of Jackson and his giant head."
"SOOKIE: I'll bring them in tomorrow."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory walks into the meeting room; Paris is going through some papers]"
"RORY: Hey Paris."
"PARIS: Have you looked over the votes for commencement speaker?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"PARIS: Are the ones for Princess Diana's butler jokes or real?"
"RORY: I'd say jokes."
"PARIS: What about the ones for Dr. Phil?"
"RORY: I think real."
"PARIS: I knew that suggestion box was a bad idea. Watch Choate get Joan Didion while we're being read ""Eloise at the Plaza."""
"RORY: Listen, before the others get here, we should probably decide what we're going to do."
"PARIS: About what?"
"RORY: About the prom coup Francie staged last week."
"PARIS: You mean booking Wadsworth Mansion?"
"RORY: Using all of the money reserved for the telescope that we wanted to buy for the senior gift."
"PARIS: Why does one pinhead always have to vote for Jerry Garcia?"
"RORY: I'm not sure if the deposit check has been sent yet, but -"
"PARIS: I already took care of that."
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: Wadsworth Mansion is owned by the Connecticut Daughters of the Mayflower. Most of those biddies couldn't negotiate an icy sidewalk much less a contract. Took me about five minutes on the phone to get them down to half their asking price."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"PARIS: Well, there was no way I was letting the class gift be a stupid tree just so Ginger Spice can have her Barbie dream prom."
"RORY: She's a sneak."
"PARIS: She's not smart enough to be a sneak. Anyone can call a meeting. It's that loser Mr. Hunter that let her get away with it."
"RORY: Well, she kind of forced him into it."
"PARIS: You can't force a teacher into something, Rory. No, it was Hunter. He's been jealous of me since I got into office. Whenever I announce I have a new motion to introduce, he flinches. Actually, physically tightens up for a moment. It's creepy."
"RORY: Yeah, but "
"FRANCIE: Well, out fearless leaders at work already. I feel so safe."
"RORY: That girl bugs me."
"PARIS: Relax, she's harmless."
"MR. HUNTER: Paris, Rory."
"PARIS: Paris, Rory. Bed wetter. Shall we sit?"
"RORY: Fine, let's sit."
"PARIS: I call this meeting of the student council to order. Is the secretary ready?"
"MADELINE: I am."
"PARIS: Then let's proceed. First of all, I'd like to apologize for missing last week's somewhat impromptu meeting. As most of you know, its scheduling was somewhat unorthodox since the meeting was a supplementary meeting, which was a concept invented by me. So the fact that anyone would hold a meeting invented by a certain person without that certain person seems, well. . .let's see, what's the word? Mutinous, insulting, underhanded, and in the end, fruitless, since I managed to re-negotiate the rental fee for the Wadsworth Mansion so that we'll be able to have the prom and give the school a respectable senior gift in the form of a telescope. Any questions, Mr. Christian? I mean, Mr. Hunter."
"MR. HUNTER: Uh, no."
"PARIS: Good. So, now that that's out of the way, let's move onto other business. Francie?"
"FRANCIE: As you know, Health Week is coming up. We have speakers lined up to discuss everything from heart disease and exercise to the dangers of sun damage and fried food. Everyone's booked and ready to go. The only thing left to figure out is where to set up the sign-up table for the annual blood drive."
"[Madeline screams]"
"FRANCIE: Geez!"
"RORY: What's the matter?"
"LOUISE: She hates the word blood."
"FRANCIE: Give me a heart attack."
"LOUISE: Just keep your hands on your ears."
"MADELINE: Tell me when it's over."
"FRANCIE: As I was saying before the freak-out, we need to figure out where to place the sign up table for the blood drive."
"MADELINE: I can still here her."
"LOUISE: Hum to yourself."
"PARIS: Continue, please."
"FRANCIE: I am proposing putting it in the cafeteria. It's got easy access, maximum exposure, and almost ninety percent of the student body visits the cafeteria every day. It's the perfect location."
"PARIS: Well?"
"RORY: No."
"FRANCIE: Excuse me?"
"RORY: You can't set up in the cafeteria. It's a fire hazard."
"PARIS: It is?"
"RORY: Yes, it's a fire hazard. You'll have to find another place."
"FRANCIE: You're kidding."
"RORY: I never kid about fire safety."
"FRANCIE: Well, Rory, I actually know the fire codes for the cafeteria, and as long as we don't cram more than three hundred people in there, we can start an opium den and the fire department wouldn't care."
"RORY: A, Francie, I think they would care, and B, I'm not talking about numbers. You set up that table, get people thinking about blood, someone smells smoke, and the next thing you know, fifty stampeding teenagers are using your body to lever open a door. I won't allow that."
"FRANCIE: This is Xanadu-level of insane."
"PARIS: You do realize you're opposing the blood drive?"
"RORY: No, I'm opposing the blood drive in the cafeteria."
"PARIS: Is it really that big a deal?"
"RORY: It's the rules, Paris, the rules of common decency, and I'll be damned if I let Francie ignore those rules."
"PARIS: Well, okay, motion denied. The senior class president will come up with an alternate plan for the location of the sign-up table for the blood drive. Now Louise, poke John Williams over there and tell her she can cut the score, we're moving on. Advertising space in the yearbook is only fifty percent sold as of right now. What are we doing to do about this? Roger, yes?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is in the living room when Lorelai walks through the front door with two takeout bags]"
"LORELAI: Dinner!"
"RORY: Over here."
"LORELAI: We are so in luck. It was international grab bag night at Al's."
"RORY: Cool. Did you peek?"
"LORELAI: And ruin the whole point of the mystery dinner? I think not. Pick."
"RORY: That one."
"LORELAI: Okay. I love this. It's food and a game all in one. Now we open them at the same time."
"RORY: I know the rules."
"LORELAI: And do not jump the g*n."
"RORY: There's a lot of pressure associated with international grab bag night."
"LORELAI: Well, I am your mother, it is my responsibility to give you structure. Now, on three  one, two, three."
"[they both open their bags and smell the food]"
"RORY: Hm, Moroccan."
"LORELAI: You always say Moroccan."
"RORY: And sooner or later, I will be right. What's yours?"
"LORELAI: Pan-Asian, with a hint of English Colonial, and a few South African influences."
"RORY: Way to hedge your bet. Kitchen?"
"LORELAI: Just let me check the machine."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Rory walks to the kitchen. Lorelai checks the answering machine]"
"ANSWERING MACHINE: Ms. Gilmore, it's Bob Merrimam, your mother's lawyer. I'm calling about the little matter of this lawsuit she's involved in. We'd like it if you could give a deposition. . ."
"LORELAI: Uh. [picks up the phone and dials a number]"
"ANSWERING MACHINE: . . on her behalf. It shouldn't be a big deal. If you could just call me tomorrow with some times that would be convenient for you, I can set something up. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, no!"
"ANSWERING MACHINE: . . .Thanks, bye."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: No, no, no, no, no."
"EMILY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Who is this?"
"LORELAI: I am not giving a deposition."
"EMILY: Of course you are, don't be ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Please leave me out of this."
"EMILY: I see. So you're just going to let this lead-footed teutonic chambermaid drag your mother into a public forum and humiliate her, is that it? Is that what I'm hearing?"
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Her lawyer knows we asked for this deposition. How do you think it's going to look when you refuse to testify for your own mother?"
"LORELAI: Like it's none of my business."
"EMILY: Oh, and I'm sure the twelve rocket scientists they assemble as a jury of my peers will see it that way."
"LORELAI: Honestly, Mom, I doubt they'll be able to find twelve people in the state of Connecticut who haven't been fired by you."
"EMILY: I can't believe my own daughter won't come to my defense."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you."
"EMILY: I just want you to tell them how I treat my maids."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you."
"EMILY: All you have to do is tell them I treat the help fairly."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna lie for you."
"EMILY: Lorelai, there is something called family loyalty. It means when someone is in trouble, you help them, as I have helped you several times over the years. The very least you could do in return is spend half an hour saying something kind about your mother."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"EMILY: Thank you. Your devotion is touching. [hangs up]"
"LORELAI: I have to give a deposition."
"RORY: I don't think this is Moroccan  or at least not recently."
"LORELAI: Want some of mine?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Yikes. Luke's?"
"RORY: Let's go."
"CUT TO THE LEARNING CENTER"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are in their class about opening an inn]"
"LECTURER: I can't stress enough the value of a good paint job. One of the first decisions you'll have to make when you open your inn is whether to employ your housekeepers individually or contract out to a housekeeping service. If you use a service, you will be assured of having a replacement housekeeper if one should call in sick or quit suddenly."
"SOOKIE: But you'll pay two dollars more an hour and they'll be loyal to the service, not to you."
"LECTURER: However, you'll probably end up paying a bit more than if you hired them individually."
"SOOKIE: I can't believe you're taking notes. He has said nothing in the last two hours that we didn't already know, and he's saying it really condescendingly. So in addition to being bored, I'm getting hostile, and a little insecure cause you're studying and I'm not."
"[Lorelai displays the cootie catcher she's just made]"
"LORELAI: Pick a color."
"SOOKIE: Pink!"
"LORELAI: Cause you're a girl."
"SOOKIE: Exactly."
"LORELAI: Pink. Pick a number."
"SOOKIE: Five."
"LORELAI: [opens the flap] You will marry Shaun Cassidy and cheat with David."
"SOOKIE: Well, good for me."
"LORELAI: My turn."
"LECTURER: [clears throat] Some of us are here to learn."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, sorry."
"LORELAI: We had a cootie catcher. . ."
"SOOKIE: We're sorry."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"LECTURER: As I was saying, the points we've covered should get you started, but remember, it's a long process, so don't get discouraged. I'm sure one day I'll be staying in each and every one of you inns."
"LORELAI: He's not staying in our inn."
"LECTURER: Now don't run off just yet. We've got one final treat. I'd like to introduce you all to John Mattern."
"JOHN: Hello everyone. I'm very pleased to be here addressing you today. I asked Brian if I could just have a few minutes at the end of today to show you all some opportunities that I think you're going to find really exciting. I know that I do. If we could. [turns on the slide projector] Now this is a lovely property that has just become available right outside of Litchfield."
"SOOKIE: It's a sales pitch?"
"LORELAI: They spend two hours telling us nothing, then try to sell us lame property?"
"SOOKIE: We already know the place we're buying."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: So what do we do?"
"LORELAI: I'm crushing your head, I'm crushing your head. Let's go."
"[Lorelai and Sookie get up and leave]"
"JOHN: A perfectly restorable sun porch wraps around the entire main structure. Let's step inside this diamond in the rough."
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk out of the room]"
"SOOKIE: Unbelievably shocking."
"LORELAI: That we could work at an inn for so long and learn so little."
"SOOKIE: We must be some kind of dumb."
"LORELAI: Who would ever have thought that all inns need doors?"
"SOOKIE: Not me."
"LORELAI: And floors."
"SOOKIE: Doors and floors, we can't afford that."
"LORELAI: Well, we better, otherwise our guests will fall right through to China."
"SOOKIE: I can just imagine the phone calls."
"LORELAI: What was Jackson thinking saying these courses were good?"
"SOOKIE: Please, you're asking me? The man took a course in diary writing."
"[they reach the refreshment table]"
"LORELAI: Thank God  food."
"SOOKIE: So, is it worth it if we can make up our seventy-five dollar admission fee in cookies?"
"LORELAI: Well, considering that in the past hour, I uttered the phrase, ""My God, I should've listened to Michel,"" these better be the best damn cookies in the world."
"SOOKIE: [tries one] And they taste like feet."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, even their cookies suck. Stand by, I'm going in for coffee."
"[two men walk up to them]"
"JOE: Sookie? Sookie St. James?"
"SOOKIE: Uh huh."
"JOE: It's Joe. . . Joe Mastoni from the Deerhill Lodge."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, Joe! Joe! Joe from the Deerhill Lodge! It's Joe from the Deerhill Lodge! How are you? Sorry. Well, come here. [hugs him] Oh! Lorelai, this is Joe. Joe, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"JOE: Nice to meet you. This is Alex, my partner."
"ALEX: Business partner."
"LORELAI: Oh, clarification duly noted. Nice to meet you."
"SOOKIE: Joe and I worked together one summer up in the Berkshires."
"JOE: Oh, God, we had a wild time that summer, didn't we?"
"LORELAI: You had a wild time, huh? Do tell."
"SOOKIE: We'd all work fourteen hours straight, party til dawn, then pile in Joe's van and wake up in New Hampshire or Maine with just enough time to get back for the next shift."
"JOE: We had a real interesting crew. Sookie, me, Feldman, Mellon, Bung "
"LORELAI: Bung?"
"SOOKIE: He was the grill man. He had been up there for a couple years already, but Joe and I were both in prep."
"LORELAI: And I repeat - Bung?"
"ALEX: Don't look at me. I'm still wondering if Mellon's a man or a woman."
"JOE: You know, I promised myself after that summer, I would never chop small green things en masse ever again."
"SOOKIE: Or drink all the leftover wine on an empty stomach."
"JOE: Let me see your hands. Hey, nice blisters."
"SOOKIE: Let me see yours. Ooh, not bad, not bad."
"JOE: I'm more careful about using the towels with the hot stuff these days."
"SOOKIE: Sissy."
"JOE: Yeah, yeah. So what are you doing here?"
"SOOKIE: Lorelai and I are opening an inn together, so we came for a class."
"JOE: Really? Alex and I are here for a class about opening your own coffee place."
"ALEX: Chain of coffee places, actually."
"SOOKIE: That's great."
"JOE: We'll see. It's pretty new territory for us."
"ALEX: Joe at least knows the food industry. I'm coming from ironworks, so I basically know what the security gate you pull down at the end of the night should be made of."
"JOE: Don't listen to him. Alex is an incredible businessman."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"ALEX: That's true."
"JOE: So far, we've got the business model planned out, there's a couple of prime locations we're interested in. The only thing left to do besides build the place is pick a name."
"LORELAI: Oh, little tip, don't choose anything cute."
"SOOKIE: Like Jitters."
"LORELAI: Or Spill the Beans."
"SOOKIE: Or Higher Ground."
"LORELAI: Or The Mudhouse."
"ALEX: Actually, I kinda like that."
"LORELAI: Oh, me too. We call dibs."
"ALEX: I thought you were opening an inn."
"LORELAI: Well, we wanna keep our options open."
"JOE: Hey, did you hear about Feldman's restaurant?"
"SOOKIE: The Feldster opened a restaurant?"
"LORELAI: Okay, I know I'm repeating myself, but the Feldster?"
"SOOKIE: I can't believe he opened his own place. He spent the whole summer getting stoned in the walk-in."
"JOE: He was our baker."
"LORELAI: Right, that figures."
"SOOKIE: Huh?"
"ALEX: Baker, getting baked, I'm there."
"LORELAI: Oh, congratulations. You still can't have The Mudhouse."
"JOE: Hey, you remember the last reception we catered? The parakeets, everyone dressed as knights and ladies."
"SOOKIE: Oh God!"
"ALEX: Old friends, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, there's nothing like them."
"SOOKIE: I never did figure out how Bung got into a fight with the bride."
"JOE: One minute everything was fine, the next he's beaning her with the ice sculpture."
"LORELAI: Hey, remember the time you and Fat Sal got locked in the freezer overnight?"
"ALEX: Fat Sal?"
"LORELAI: Work with me here."
"ALEX: Oh, Fat Sal, yes, right."
"SOOKIE: Then Feldman got into a fight with the bride's mother."
"JOE: That's right! He went after the whole bridal party."
"LORELAI: And you remember how me and the Bruiser "
"ALEX: Never liked that guy."
"LORELAI: We found you and Fat Sal in the morning and you were frozen together like bacon."
"ALEX: Yeah. You know, I still can't eat bacon."
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"JOE: And you remember what Feldman told the cops?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah!"
"LORELAI: And then before Bruiser and I would let you out, we made you and Fat Sal kiss."
"ALEX: I'm not sure I remember that."
"SOOKIE: You know, I actually don't remember what Feldman told the cops."
"JOE: He tried to pretend he didn't speak English, remember?"
"SOOKIE: That's right, oh my God! The flooginshorts!"
"JOE: Yes, the flooginshorts!"
"LORELAI: Oh, great. Now we have to make up our own language?"
"ALEX: This is getting exhausting."
"JOE: You know, Feldman's restaurant's right here in Hartford."
"SOOKIE: No, really?"
"JOE: Yeah. We should swing by one night and bust his chops."
"SOOKIE: Hey, yeah, we could keep sending back plate after plate until he gets so angry he comes out."
"JOE: Let's make a plan."
"SOOKIE: Sure. Call me at the Independence Inn, that's where we work."
"LORELAI: For now."
"JOE: Sounds great. I'm so glad we ran into each other."
"SOOKIE: Me too."
"JOE: And it was nice meeting you, Lorelai. Good luck with everything."
"LORELAI: Thanks, you too."
"ALEX: I'm really glad we got a chance to catch up."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. Hey, if you see Fat Sal, give him a kiss for me."
"ALEX: I'll do that."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Bye."
"[Alex and Joe walk away]"
"SOOKIE: Wait, so you and that guy knew each other, too? What a coincidence!"
"LORELAI: Come on, honey."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Rory and Paris sit down at a table with their lunch trays]"
"PARIS: How many times do I have to tell them? You can't put a two-inch ladle of gravy into a one-inch potato crater. You either need a smaller ladle or a bigger crater  otherwise, you get this."
"RORY: Gravy on your asparagus."
"PARIS: Yes."
"RORY: Paris, the cafeteria workers serve hundreds of students a day. A little gravy spillage is natural."
"PARIS: I see. So I should just sit quietly and shovel in whatever slop they throw my way like some inmate in the chow line at Leavenworth doing twenty to life? I don't think so."
"RORY: I'll save your seat."
"[Paris walks away. A paper airplane lands on Rory's tray, it says ""We need to meet. Write down a time and place."" Rory writes on it, then hears a noise and turns around. Someone takes the airplane when her back is turned. Paris walks back to the table.]"
"PARIS: They took my tray. I can't believe they took my tray. All I did was go up there and tell them I wanted some new asparagus, and they took my tray. Well, I also told them to buy a slightly looser hair net, one that wouldn't squish the part of the brain that can judge depth and measurements, and then they took my tray, but still. . .now what? You gonna eat that?"
"[Rory gives Paris her lunch tray]"
"CUT TO PARKING GARAGE"
"[Rory walks through an empty parking garage. She hears a noise, and turns to find Francie]"
"FRANCIE: Good, you're here. We need to talk."
"RORY: We have three classes together, we couldn't talk then?"
"FRANCIE: I thought alone would be better. Besides, you picked the place."
"RORY: What do you want?"
"FRANCIE: I want a truce."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"FRANCIE: A truce, you know, no more fighty fighty."
"RORY: I don't believe you."
"FRANCIE: Look, this is not the way I wanted things to work out, honestly. Yes, the hemline thing bugged me, and yes, Paris is not my idea of a secret sister, but I never intended for things to go so far."
"RORY: No?"
"FRANCIE: No. I mean, it's my senior year, too. Why would I want to spend the whole time scheming and fighting? It's too exhausting. I wanna stop this w*r, this vendetta, this Sicilian thing. It must end."
"RORY: This seems awful sudden."
"FRANCIE: Yes, well, my time is precious, so if I'm not gonna truly commit to a grudge, I'd like to move on and put that energy somewhere else. Come on, what do you say? Friends, sort of?"
"RORY: Friends. . .sort of."
"FRANCIE: Shake."
"[They shake hands. A car alarm goes off, startling Rory. When she turns back around, Francie is gone]"
"RORY: Stop doing that."
""
""
""
"CUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks up to Michel at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so you'll come in early and set up the conference room for the group from Michigan."
"MICHEL: Yes, I will."
"LORELAI: Okay. Now, Sookie's on top of the menu. Let's make sure the, uh, dining room's open for a late lunch, and we need to confirm the number of rooms they'll need."
"MICHEL: Yes, I have all of this written down on a notepad right next to my self-help book, ""Why Don't People Think You Know What The Hell You're Doing?"""
"LORELAI: Sorry. I'm just a little stressed at this whole stupid deposition thing."
"MICHEL: Relax, it's very easy."
"LORELAI: It is? You've done it?"
"MICHEL: Once, it was nothing."
"LORELAI: Why were you deposed?"
"MICHEL: My neighbor had this dog, a frisky little scamp that used to love to yap to his friends all night long. It was so cute. Then one day he disappeared. I told the police what I knew, but sadly the adorable little chatterbox was never found. It was tragic."
"LORELAI: You got rid of a dog?"
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: How could you get rid of a dog?"
"MICHEL: I will gladly show you the transcript from the lawyer and the results of the lie detector test."
"LORELAI: You're heinous."
"MICHEL: And very well rested."
"[Michel walks away as Joe enters the inn]"
"JOE: Lorelai, hi. Remember me?"
"LORELAI: Of course I do. Nice to see you again, Joe."
"JOE: This is a beautiful place you have here."
"LORELAI: Ah, well, you know. . . keeps the rain off."
"JOE: Right. So, is Sookie around?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, uh, she is. Uh, right through there in the kitchen."
"JOE: Thank you."
"[Joe walks away as Michel walks back over]"
"MICHEL: Here, give me those. I'll file them with the rest."
"[Lorelai barks at him]"
"MICHEL: Ah, stop that!"
"CUT TO THE KITCHEN"
"[Joe walks in to find Sookie]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, I'll just be a minute."
"JOE: Oh no, don't rush."
"SOOKIE: I was almost finished with the dinner prep, and then I changed my mind about two of the appetizers."
"JOE: Sounds like old times. Though, I gotta say, this place is a long way from the sweatbox at the Deerhill."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, we've upgraded a lot in the past few years. We just got a refrigerated prep table and we replaced the two vertical mixers."
"JOE: But you still got the old fifty-two inch Viking."
"SOOKIE: I know. I just like how big it is. I blew it up once."
"JOE: Wow."
"SOOKIE: But I had them rebuild it. I refuse to cook on anything else."
"JOE: Stick with what you know."
"SOOKIE: Exactly. Taste this."
"JOE: Maybe a bit more brandy."
"SOOKIE: I knew you'd say that."
"JOE: Well, people like brandy."
"SOOKIE: You mean you like brandy."
"JOE: And I'm people. We always had a good time together, didn't we?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, it was a good group."
"JOE: You always made it better."
"SOOKIE: Cause I kept you fools from driving off the side of a mountain."
"JOE: Very true. You know, I'm really glad we ran into each other. It's not often you get a second chance."
"SOOKIE: What do you mean?"
"JOE: I can't tell you how many times I kicked myself for not asking you out that summer. It just seemed like every time I got close, we'd end up talking about the best way to make calves liver or something."
"SOOKIE: Sautéed with caramelized onions."
"JOE: Exactly. Then when I saw you at the Learning Center, it was like fate was saying, ""Here you go, man. Try not to screw it up again."" I guess things just had to happen in their own time."
"SOOKIE: Uh huh, in their own time. Um, could you just. . .uh, stir. . . yeah, I'll be back."
"CUT TO LOBBY"
"[Sookie walks up to Lorelai at the front desk.]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Oh, no, sir, I'm afraid we don't offer a complimentary breakfast."
"SOOKIE: [whispers] He thinks it's a date."
"LORELAI: Uh, yes, sir, I realize the Ramada does."
"SOOKIE: [whispers] Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Uh, well, if you like, I could recommend a few places in town. Uh, okay, uh huh, sure. Why don't you talk to your wife and call me back. Okay, bye. [hangs up] Hey, Shields and Yarnell, what's going on?"
"SOOKIE: He thinks it's a date."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Joe, he thinks this is a date."
"LORELAI: Is he crazy?"
"SOOKIE: Exactly. You were there  it's not a date, is it?"
"LORELAI: No. The two of you were gonna go bust Feldster's chops. Busting chops is not a date."
"SOOKIE: That's what I thought, but he keeps saying how he liked me back then and how this is his second chance."
"LORELAI: He's liked you for ten years?"
"SOOKIE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Wow. That is some serious Great Gatsby pining."
"SOOKIE: I know."
"LORELAI: You're his Daisy."
"SOOKIE: I am? I'm his Daisy. I'm someone's Daisy."
"LORELAI: It's very flattering."
"SOOKIE: It is very flattering. But I didn't bring it on, did I? I mean, did I flirt?"
"LORELAI: No, you did not flirt. You were talking about Bung."
"SOOKIE: Right. And you can't flirt when talking about Bung, it's impossible."
"LORELAI: He read something into it because he wanted to."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, what's Jackson's gonna say?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, it's a misunderstanding. Jackson will be fine. Just go in there and explain it to Joe."
"SOOKIE: But what do I tell him? He's waited ten years for this. How do you hand out that kind of rejection? I could tell him I've become a lesbian!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, or ""I'm married"" might work."
"SOOKIE: Right, I'm married, good, that's very good."
"LORELAI: It's gonna be fine. Joe's a nice guy with good taste."
"SOOKIE: I'm his Daisy."
"LORELAI: Be happy later."
"SOOKIE: Right. I'm going in. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"[Sookie walks back into the kitchen]"
"JOE: So, at the risk of seeming like Joe the drunken chef, I added some more Port to the Cumberland sauce. Now, just promise to try it."
"SOOKIE: Joe, we need to talk."
"JOE: Wow, you've mellowed. In the old days, you would've just called me an idiot and just dumped it in the trash."
"SOOKIE: It's not that, it's. . .you put in more Port? This is a pheasant sauce, not the punch bowl at a frat party."
"JOE: Just try it."
"SOOKIE: No, no, no, no, no, that's not what I meant to say. It's just. . .there's been a misunderstanding. I thought this thing tonight was just a friends thing, you know, not like a date thing."
"JOE: Oh."
"SOOKIE: Not that going out with you would be bad. Except it would be. . . very, very bad."
"JOE: Wow."
"SOOKIE: But only because I'm married! I meant to say that first. [holds up her hand] See? Last May, I just. . .[realizes she's not wearing her wedding ring] Where's my. . .oh, hang on. [walks over to get her ring] See, this was supposed to be. . .when I hold my hand up, cause otherwise, ""Whatcha doin'?"", right? Okay, here. I take it off when I'm cooking, but, look, there it is, right where it should be, on my finger."
"JOE: You're married."
"SOOKIE: Yes, I am. I hope that's okay."
"JOE: Hey, if your husband's good with it, who am I to complain?"
"SOOKIE: You're not mad?"
"JOE: Why would I be mad?"
"SOOKIE: Because you thought this was a date."
"JOE: I'm not mad. Feeling a little stupid, but not mad."
"SOOKIE: Here, let me give you some money."
"JOE: I didn't spend any money."
"SOOKIE: Well, let me give you some money anyway."
"JOE: Look, the only way I'll be mad is if you throw that sauce out before you try it, okay?"
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"JOE: Tell you what, why don't we make a plan to harass Feldman some other time? You can bring your husband and I'll see if I can get a real date."
"SOOKIE: That'd be fun. Come on, I'll walk you out."
"[they walk to the lobby]"
"JOE: You know, we could even get some of the old gang together."
"SOOKIE: I'll drive."
"JOE: I guess this'll teach me not to wait ten years next time. Anyway, I'll give you a call."
"SOOKIE: Bye Joe."
"[Joe leaves. Lorelai walks up to Sookie]"
"LORELAI: See, he's smiling. I knew it was nothing to get worked up over. You obviously let him down very well, and now maybe you guys can be friends."
"SOOKIE: I'm a whore!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking through the town square]"
"LORELAI: This is silly. I know how to answer a question."
"RORY: This is your first deposition. Grandma's lawyers just want you to be prepared."
"LORELAI: Sample questions, great. It's bad enough I have to give a deposition, now I have to study for it?"
"RORY: Shall we begin?"
"LORELAI: Go ahead."
"RORY: Please describe how your mother runs her household."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well, do you remember the rowing scene in Ben Hur?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, did that reference date me? Should I have gone with the ""Express Yourself"" video?"
"RORY: Shall we stop?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, ask me another."
"RORY: Would you say your mother is an easy woman to get along with?"
"LORELAI: No. Next."
"RORY: You're not taking this seriously."
"LORELAI: I am taking this seriously."
"RORY: Well, you can't say that."
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, so you want me to lie."
"RORY: No, you don't have to lie. It's all about how you present the truth. For example, you could have said, ""My mother is a perfectionist."""
"LORELAI: Uh huh. And do you promise to visit Mommy in jail?"
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Okay, then. My mother is a perfectionist."
"RORY: Very good."
"[they reach the diner as Luke walks out]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. Where you going?"
"LUKE: Oh, well, I'm going to Doose's because we are out of food."
"LORELAI: How can you be out of food?"
"LUKE: Well, it starts with the words, ""Hey Jess, you do the ordering this week, okay?"" and it ends with me selling Kirk a lettuce sandwich."
"RORY: We've eaten those."
"LUKE: I'm gonna go pick up some stuff to hold us over til tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Well, get some burgers."
"RORY: And tater tots."
"LORELAI: And pickles."
"LUKE: Okay, hold on a sec. Burgers, tater tots, pickles. You want cheese on the burger?"
"LORELAI: Cheddar."
"RORY: And swiss."
"LUKE: Dessert?"
"LORELAI: Do we have to decide right now?"
"LUKE: I would seriously advise it."
"LORELAI: Pie."
"RORY: Cherry."
"LORELAI: And whipped cream. And dental floss. And paper towels. And People magazine. We're really hungry."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Paris walks into the bathroom. Francie follows her]"
"FRANCIE: Paris, good, I so need to talk to you. [to another girl in bathroom] Are you lost? [the girl leaves] Listen, first of all, I really wanna commend you on your job as president so far."
"PARIS: Thank you."
"FRANCIE: The way you've negotiated on some of those convoluted school issues  mind blowing. I watch in awe."
"PARIS: Uh huh."
"FRANCIE: And that's why this is so hard, because I have major respect for you, and the last thing I ever want is for you to get the wrong impression about my loyalties."
"PARIS: What are you talking about?"
"FRANCIE: [pulls an envelope out of her backpack] These were shoved in my locker this morning, and I didn't know what to do, so I thought to myself, I'll just show them to Paris and I'll explain and she'll understand.'"
"PARIS: Explain what? What is this?"
"[Paris opens the envelope and pulls out some photos of Rory and Francie in the parking garage]"
"FRANCIE: Rory came to me and said she wanted to talk about some things. . .you know, policy, the prom, the senior gift, et cetera. So of course I said, ""why don't we talk about them at the student council meeting with Paris?"" And she said she wanted to do this without Paris. She said Paris is just too wrapped up in that boyfriend of hers to care about any of this. I didn't know what to do, so I went, and then I found these, and I'm just so upset. I mean, I would never intentionally do anything behind your back, Paris. And I promise, the next time Rory tries to get me to, I'm just gonna say, Talk to the hand', you know what I mean?"
"PARIS: Yes, I know what you mean."
"FRANCIE: Are you mad? Say you're not mad. I just couldn't live if I thought you were mad."
"PARIS: No, I'm not mad. [leaves]"
"FRANCIE: Well, thank God for that."
"CUT TO CHILTON GYMNASIUM"
"[Students are standing around in fencing outfits]"
"TEACHER: Okay class, we will begin in five minutes."
"MADELINE: Does your helmet smell? I always get one that smells."
"LOUISE: You'd think the brain trust behind P.E. could come up with some sport that didn't give you helmet hair all afternoon."
"MADELINE: Like badminton."
"LOUISE: Or striptease aerobics."
"RORY: What?"
"MADELINE: It's really big in L.A. You just go through the motions, you don't actually have to strip."
"RORY: Do the other people in the gym throw money at you?"
"LOUISE: Fine, mock, but tell me this  have you ever seen an overweight stripper?"
"RORY: The word no seems so wildly inadequate all of a sudden. Hey, where have you been?"
"PARIS: Washing my hands."
"RORY: Okay."
"TEACHER: All right everyone, take your places. We will warm up with your counter-sixte-riposte-quarte. Melanie, please lead the group."
"MADELINE: Oh my God, there's a hair in mine."
"LOUISE: Just close your eyes and think of England, honey."
"RORY: Doesn't it seem strange to be practicing a sport whose original purpose was to k*ll people? It's like if high schools of the future had teams in a*tillery or high altitude b*mb or something."
"TEACHER: Beginning salute. En garde. Right side advance."
"RORY: You okay?"
"TEACHER: Right side retreat."
"PARIS: Why do you ask?"
"TEACHER: And lunge."
"RORY: You just seem weird."
"TEACHER: Left side advance."
"RORY: Easy there, Paris."
"TEACHER: Left side retreat."
"PARIS: We're fencing Rory, not playing patty cake."
"TEACHER: And lunge."
"PARIS: You know, it's interesting how you think you know someone."
"TEACHER: Right side, quarte lunge."
"PARIS: Trust a person, rely on a person, then turn around one day and realize you'd been had. Ever experience that?"
"TEACHER: Ripost."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: I hate being had."
"RORY: Why are you telling me this? You're not supposed to be parrying that hard."
"PARIS: Gee, I'm sorry. Maybe I should turn around so you can just stick it directly into my back."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"PARIS: I saw the pictures."
"RORY: What pictures?"
"PARIS: You know what pictures."
"RORY: Obviously I don't know what pictures."
"PARIS: The pictures of you and Francie."
"RORY: Me and Francie?"
"PARIS: You and Francie in the parking garage talking about me."
"RORY: Paris, I "
"PARIS: Don't make that face at me!"
"RORY: What face? I'm wearing a mask."
"PARIS: The ""I'm Rory, don't you want to pet me?"" face. I know you two have been meeting behind my back."
"RORY: We haven't. We met once."
"PARIS: Aha, you admit it."
"RORY: Yes, but it wasn't what you think."
"PARIS: Brutus!"
"RORY: Paris, you have to listen to me. Francie wanted to meet, she said she wanted to call a truce. She took those pictures of us, she's setting me up, she's trying to manipulate you."
"PARIS: Of course she is. You think I don't know when someone's trying to manipulate me? But that doesn't change the fact that you met with her behind my back."
"RORY: I was trying to help you."
"PARIS: You were? You mean, in between betraying me and selling me out, you were trying to help me? Gee, you are quite the Renaissance woman, aren't you?"
"RORY: Stop it!"
"PARIS: Make me! Come back here, Gilmore! Come back and fight like a man. [Paris chases Rory around the gym until Rory trips and falls] And the worst part is, you told her about Jamie. I can't believe I ever considered you my best friend."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk to the porch]"
"RORY: I still can't believe it. I can't believe I got sucked in like that."
"LORELAI: Ugh, that Francie is pure evil, so she'll probably wind up president."
"RORY: Paris is so upset. She totally thinks I betrayed her."
"LORELAI: She'll calm down."
"RORY: Paris has never calmed down."
"LORELAI: She'll calm down."
"RORY: I can't believe I was her best friend. I feel awful."
"LORELAI: Look, I'll tell you what. If you wanna make things right, just go back to school tomorrow and let her stab you."
"RORY: Great idea."
"LORELAI: I'm nothing if not full of suggestions."
"RORY: Or full of something."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"RORY: Hey Grandma."
"LORELAI: Hi Mom."
"EMILY: Come in, it's cold."
"[they walk inside]"
"LORELAI: Do you want me to talk to her? You know, arrange a sit-down?"
"RORY: No, thanks."
"LORELAI: Come on. We'll have it in an Italian restaurant. You'll get up, go to the bathroom  thanks  and come out sh**ting, and then I'll send you to Italy."
"RORY: Well, I do wanna go to Italy."
"LORELAI: Two birds with one stone, my friend."
"[they walk to the living room and sit down]"
"LORELAI: Is everything okay, Mom?"
"EMILY: Of course it's okay. Why wouldn't it be okay?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. You just seem a little quiet."
"EMILY: Do I? I guess I do. I don't really have a lot to say, actually. I know, why don't I read to you instead. [picks up a booklet]"
"LORELAI: Huh, what's that?"
"EMILY: This? Nothing, just your deposition."
"LORELAI: My. . .how did you get "
"EMILY: Shh. Listen, it's fun. Okay. [reads] ""Question  Would you say your mother is a tolerant woman?"""
"LORELAI: Oh boy."
"EMILY: ""Answer  Um, well, sure."""
"LORELAI: What? I said you were."
"EMILY: You said sure."
"LORELAI: Which to most people means yes."
"EMILY: Yes, to most people, it does, but I've heard you say sure, and your sure is always sarcastic."
"LORELAI: I do not have a sarcastic sure. . .do I?"
"RORY: Pick spot on carpet and stare."
"EMILY: ""Question  Why has your mother dismissed maids in the past?"""
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: ""Answer  Different reasons."""
"LORELAI: Well, that's true, right?"
"EMILY: ""Can you expand on that? Answer  Gee, how much time do you have?"""
"LORELAI: Okay, see "
"EMILY: ""I mean, if you guys have a lunch or an afternoon squash game or something. . .you look like the kind of guys who play squash. And hey, why's it called squash? Is it something to do with the fruit? Or vegetable, right? A squash is a vegetable, though if you ask me, it's gross no matter what you call it. Well, anyway, what I'm saying is you might want to clear your afternoon."""
"LORELAI: I was flustered. He was using lawyer tricks."
"RORY: By asking you to expand?"
"LORELAI: Now you decide to pipe in?"
"EMILY: Didn't I tell you this was important, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you did."
"EMILY: So, in spite of the fact that I told you it was important, you couldn't find it in your heart to put aside your personal antagonism toward me for one day and help me out."
"LORELAI: Mom, this is not fair. I said a lot of nice things about you in there."
"EMILY: Oh really? ""Would you say your mother sets impossible goals which people cannot help but fail to reach, thereby reinforcing her already formed opinion of their deficiencies? Answer  Only for her daughter."""
"LORELAI: Okay, not there, but keep flipping."
"MAID: I'm sorry to interrupt, but dinner is ready Mrs. Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Dinner, hey! Dinner's ready. Who's hungry besides me? I'd keep it warm. We're gonna be here awhile. Okay, go ahead."
"EMILY: ""Would you call your mother an extremely critical woman? Long pause."" Why was there a long pause, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Because I was deliberately trying to hurt you, Mom."
"EMILY: ""On a scale from one to ten, what would you rate your mother in terms of compassion for others' feelings?"" Wanna guess what she said?"
"RORY: No, thank you."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Hang on a second, Lorelai. I just want to skip to the Ben Hur reference."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I did."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory sits alone in the cafeteria. A paper airplane that says ""Leper"" lands on her table. She tosses it aside and puts on her headphones.]"
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Jackson walks through the front door]"
"JACKSON: Sookie, I'm home. I got the -"
"SOOKIE: Surprise!"
"JACKSON: What is this?"
"SOOKIE: I made you dinner."
"JACKSON: It smells terrific."
"SOOKIE: Lamb chops with Sicilian olives, rosemary and garlic, and a warm potato and chorizo salad."
"JACKSON: I love lamb chops with Sicilian olives, rosemary and garlic, and a warm potato and chorizo salad."
"SOOKIE: I know."
"JACKSON: What's that?"
"SOOKIE: Beef jerky."
"JACKSON: You made beef jerky for me."
"SOOKIE: And there's cornbread, and fried marshmallow pie for dessert."
"JACKSON: And you have CCR on."
"SOOKIE: Well, you like CCR."
"JACKSON: I know I like CCR, you don't like CCR."
"SOOKIE: Sometimes I like CCR, and tonight I like CCR."
"JACKSON: You cheated on me!"
"SOOKIE: No."
"JACKSON: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: I just flirted accidentally!"
"JACKSON: Turn it off."
"SOOKIE: Let me explain."
"JACKSON: Every time I hear it now, it'll remind me that my wife cheated on me."
"SOOKIE: Flirted  accidentally!"
"JACKSON: You ruined Creedence for me!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the couch, Rory walks into the living room]"
"RORY: I'm going to bed."
"LORELAI: At nine-thirty?"
"RORY: Yeah, well, going a whole day without talking to anyone is a lot more tiring than you think."
"LORELAI: I hate those girls."
"RORY: It's fine. It was the first lunch that didn't start with a recitation of the calorie content of everything on the table, so actually it was kind of a relief."
"LORELAI: I hate them anyhow."
"RORY: Night."
"LORELAI: Night babe."
"[Rory walks back to her room as the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello?"
"ALEX: Lorelai, it's Alex Lesman. We met at The Learning Center the other day. My friend accidentally asked your friend out on a date."
"LORELAI: Um, right, hi."
"ALEX: How are ya?"
"LORELAI: I'm good."
"ALEX: Fat Sal sends his love."
"LORELAI: Right back at him."
"ALEX: Look, I know this must seem kind of out of the blue. You're probably wondering how I got your number."
"LORELAI: Information?"
"ALEX: No, that would've been far too logical. I actually called your inn. I was gonna leave a message, but this French guy just gave me your home number. Said I shouldn't worry about calling too late, that you usually stay up til three, four in the morning."
"LORELAI: Yeah, don't worry about him, he's getting fired tomorrow. So, what's up?"
"ALEX: Well, I was wondering something."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. . ."
"ALEX: On weekends, I like to go to different coffee shops, try their coffee, look at what they're doing."
"LORELAI: See if there's anything you can steal and possibly disguise as your own?"
"ALEX: Exactly, kind of a low-rent corporate espionage. Anyway, sometimes I'll hit two coffee shops that have surprisingly similar product, and I for the life of me cannot decide which one is better."
"LORELAI: Bummer."
"ALEX: Yes, bummer, so I thought it would really help to have another person there who could help me make these crucial evaluations."
"LORELAI: Interesting solution to a fascinating problem."
"ALEX: So I was wondering what you were doing this Saturday."
"LORELAI: You know, it's funny you should ask me this, because I just happen to be one of the world's foremost coffee experts."
"ALEX: Really?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, it's basically just me and this guy named Chuckles in Brazil."
"ALEX: Sounds like fate. So, what do you say?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"ALEX: Great. Just to be on the safe side, you do know this is a date, right?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I got that."
"ALEX: Good."
"LORELAI: So, you guys come up with a name for your place yet?"
"ALEX: Right now, the top contender is Sludge."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"ALEX: Moving on, my partner likes Regular Joe."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"ALEX: Then again, his name is Joe."
"LORELAI: Well, fancy that."
"ALEX: So, still won't let go of The Mudhouse, huh?"
"LORELAI: Afraid not. What else you got?"
"ALEX: Well, okay, how about Black Liquid Hope Sold Here?"
"LORELAI: See, now you're making some progress."

"OPEN IN LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Rory are staring at their garage]"
"RORY: Well."
"LORELAI: I'd say three years."
"RORY: I'd say more like four."
"LORELAI: What? It has not been four years since we've stepped foot inside our own garage."
"RORY: It was when we got the Jeep."
"LORELAI: That wasn't. . .yes, it was."
"RORY: And even then, I think we only got as far as opening the door before something flew out and scared you."
"LORELAI: Yes, it scared me while you stood by calmly like Dr. Dolittle chatting with the bat."
"RORY: It was a bat, wasn't it?"
"LORELAI: Wearing an OzzFest T-shit, I believe."
"RORY: Will the man never be able to live that down?"
"LORELAI: Well, Joe Namath will forever be wearing pantyhose."
"RORY: True, very true."
"LORELAI: So, uh, what do we do about the bat cave?"
"RORY: Well, we did promise Lane that her band could rehearse here."
"LORELAI: Yes, we did."
"RORY: And they'll probably need to actually get in there to do so."
"LORELAI: So I guess we're going in."
"RORY: I guess we are."
"LORELAI: All right. On three  one, two, three."
"[They open the garage doors]"
"RORY: Ah!"
"LORELAI: What, what is it?"
"RORY: Those are the boxes from our attic that you were supposed to give away two years ago."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I spent three days boxing all the stuff in the attic and you were going to call a charity and get someone to pick them up."
"LORELAI: I made an appointment, the guy didn't show."
"RORY: He didn't?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't think."
"RORY: Unbelievable."
"LORELAI: Look, I got bored after sitting there two hours, so I left a note saying the stuff was in the garage and he could leave a receipt, and I went to get some coffee."
"RORY: These guys aren't just allowed to go into someone's garage."
"LORELAI: Well, the note said it was okay."
"RORY: Well, how did he know that the note was authentic?"
"LORELAI: I wrote it on Powerpuff Girls stationery. Who'd he think was setting him up, Hello Kitty?"
"RORY: I can't believe how much junk we have."
"LORELAI: Hey, these are  these are souvenirs from our life's journey, girly girl. This is not junk. Okay, this is junk, and that over there is junk. All right, basically everything I'm looking at is, yeah, junk."
"RORY: We're pack rats."
"LORELAI: We're Sanford and Son. Yuck, bye bye. [throws a stuffed ball out of the garage]"
"RORY: Wait! [catches the ball]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Hug-a-World!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Hug-a-World, it's my Hug-a-World."
"LORELAI: Where's the world?"
"RORY: It's faded."
"LORELAI: Oh, wait, I can see something."
"RORY: Canada."
"LORELAI: Canada, nice. Okay."
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm throwing it out."
"RORY: You can't throw out Hug-a-World."
"LORELAI: I'm not throwing out Hug-a-World, I'm throwing out Hug-a-Canada."
"RORY: I learned my seven continents on Hug-a-World, don't you remember? We used to squeeze it as tight as we could and then wherever our pinkies would end up, that's where we were going to go together when I grew up."
"LORELAI: Yes, many a trip to Uzbekistan was planned that way."
"RORY: We can clean him up and keep him, can't we?"
"LORELAI: Throw him outside and I'll see what I can do."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: If I clean up Hug-a-World, does that cancel out me not getting rid of the boxers?"
"RORY: I'll consider it a wash."
"LORELAI: How about if I chase it and bring it back?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Hug-a-World would like to see the world."
"RORY: It's moving."
"LORELAI: There's something living there besides Canadians."
"RORY: I hugged it, I hugged it really tight."
"LORELAI: Yes, you did."
"RORY: I have to shower! [runs away]"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, hey, what about the rest of the garage? Rory! Hey, how bout if Lane's band rehearses in the kitchen? We don't use that either."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[There is construction going on outside. Luke tries to take an order over the noise]"
"LUKE: Can I take. . .Can I take. . .What can I get. . . That's it. [goes outside]"
"TAYLOR: I specifically requested a carved arch above the door."
"TOM: It's a blueprint, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Yes, Tom, I know it's a blueprint."
"LUKE: Taylor!"
"TAYLOR: One second, Luke. I know it's a blueprint, Tom, but if I don't see a carved archway here, then I don't expect to see a carved archway there, and if I don't see an archway there, then you won't see a paycheck here. Are we clear?"
"TOM: Get away from my saw, Taylor."
"LUKE: What the hell is going on?"
"TAYLOR: I'm renovating your building. You know that very well."
"LUKE: I also know that the renovation is supposed to be going on over there inside the building."
"TAYLOR: There is plenty of room to move around if you turn sideways."
"LUKE: I'm gonna punch you in the nose."
"TAYLOR: I have every right to make the necessary renovations to the building that I am paying good money to lease."
"LUKE: Taylor, if any other person in this town pulled a stunt like this in front of your market, you'd have them arrested."
"TAYLOR: I have acquired all the necessary permits to do exactly what I'm doing, and all of this has been looked over and approved by the town magistrate."
"LUKE: You're the town magistrate!"
"TAYLOR: And as such, if you have any complaints about me, you may take them up with me."
"TOM: Get him away from my saw."
"LUKE: Get him away from my diner."
"TAYLOR: By the way, Luke, I noticed you hadn't returned any of my lawyer's calls about the lease agreement. Now we have to set up an appointment to see that those papers get signed."
"LUKE: Forget it. I'm not going through any lawyer. You want those papers signed, you pick them up and you walk them over to me. Then, I'll sign them."
"TAYLOR: Luke, this is business. It needs to be done properly and legally."
"LUKE: It's a standard lease form, Taylor. I bought it at Office Depot."
"TAYLOR: All the more reason to have a professional take a little looksee, huh? I mean, there's a reason they say good lawyers make for good neighbors."
"LUKE: Who the hell said that?"
"TAYLOR: Oh, everybody says that. Okay, now back to work. Tom, let's take another look at this archway, shall we?"
"TOM: Get away from my saw, Taylor."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lane and the band are setting up in the garage]"
"LORELAI: I already talked to the neighbors. Just make sure you keep the doors closed, and the music must stop by eight."
"LANE: Don't worry, I have to be home by six."
"ZACH: We'll be done by eight, don't you worry."
"LORELAI: I won't."
"ZACH: Okay, okay, okay, Lorelai, okay."
"LORELAI: Uh, so, um, Rory showed you the key. Uh, you're welcome to anything in the kitchen, which is nothing, but, uh, the water's yours for the taking. Just replace the bottle if it's out."
"ZACH: You ask, I will obey."
"LORELAI: Super."
"BRIAN: I'm out!"
"LORELAI: He's out! I'll get you some more!"
"LANE: Oh, no, no, don't worry about it. I'll get it."
"LORELAI: Okay. Oh, excuse me. Do you need any help?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Do you need any help, please?"
"RORY: I'm good, Pamela Des Barres."
"LORELAI: When did you turn on Mommy?"
"RORY: What? He's cute."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: And you know, if you latch on now, you're totally entitled to half of everything when he dumps you after he's famous."
"LORELAI: Okay, um, since you don't need any help, simply a new place to live, I'm gonna just go."
"ZACH: Listen. . ."
"LORELAI: You're back, okay, hi."
"ZACH: We're gonna be playing a gig next month, and I think you'd really get into it."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I'd love to get into it, Zach, but see, I have this medical condition where I can't listen to music."
"ZACH: You can't?"
"LORELAI: No. My ears, the hollow tubey thing inside is very tiny and it will literally explode if I listen to anything loud and musical."
"ZACH: That sucks."
"LORELAI: I know. Thanks for the invite, I'm sure it's gonna be great. Uh, so, uh, you guys have a good rehearsal. I'm gonna go on inside and write to Tipper. Great gal. See you guys later."
"RORY: Bye Pam."
"ZACH: She is some kind of fine."
"BRIAN: Zach, some help would be great."
"ZACH: Relax."
"LANE: I still can't believe you guys are letting us rehearse here."
"RORY: You can thank us in the liner notes."
"LANE: Right under our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
"RORY: That's some good billing. So, are you guys actually playing a gig next month?"
"LANE: Abby Berland's birthday party. Her parents are letting her have a band."
"RORY: That'd be great."
"LANE: Cross your fingers she doesn't wreck the car again and her mother doesn't cancel it before we get to play."
"RORY: I'll hide the keys myself."
"BRIAN: Okay, I'm done."
"DAVE: Me too."
"ZACH: Let's do this."
"DAVE: Listen, Lane, we need to talk a sec."
"LANE: Sure."
"DAVE: Now that we finally have a real rehearsal space, we can get serious about the sound."
"LANE: Absolutely."
"DAVE: Which means that I'm gonna need you to really step it up a little."
"LANE: Oh."
"DAVE: I mean, you've got the potential, but you're sloppy. I need a clean roll on the toms but powerful, like Moon."
"LANE: Okay."
"DAVE: I know you're a girl, but I need you to play like a guy."
"LANE: I understand."
"DAVE: And if you can't, if that's too hard. . ."
"LANE: No, that's not too hard. I'll be better, I promise."
"DAVE: Okay."
"[Dave walks away. Rory walks up to Lane]"
"RORY: Okay, please take this the way it's intended, but I am going to kick Dave in the shins repeatedly for the next hour and a half."
"LANE: Why?"
"RORY: Why? Did you hear the way he was talking to you? ""Play like a guy, Lane."" Well, cry like a girl, Dave! What? Why are you smiling like that?"
"LANE: He fooled you."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: We thought the other guys might be catching on about me and Dave so we came up with this plan."
"RORY: That he become a jerk?"
"LANE: Yes. If the other guys see him talking down to me like that, they will totally be thrown off track."
"RORY: Okay, but doesn't it bother you to hear him talk to you like that?"
"LANE: No way. Believe me, he knows I play better, harder, Moonier than any guy they could possibly find, plus I smell better."
"RORY: Okay, as long as you're fine with it."
"LANE: I am, I'm fine with it."
"DAVE: And also Lane, I need four strong b*at, not two strong ones and two whatever ones. You set the tone, Lane. If you suck, we suck."
"LANE: God, he's wonderful."
"CUT TO COFFEE SHOP"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table as Alex walks over with two little coffee cups]"
"ALEX: Okay, now this is the Sumatra blend. It's supposed to be a little sharper than the Colombian."
"LORELAI: You know, this is pretty much what I thought heaven would look like. There might have been a unicorn in the corner, but basically  yeah, this is it. Um, so I've had fifteen of these tiny coffees."
"ALEX: Yes, you have."
"LORELAI: And you're telling me that all this tasting is completely free?"
"ALEX: Yes."
"LORELAI: So I'm a cheap date."
"ALEX: Well, the tasting is free, but I have to promise to stock my coffee chain from this warehouse, so actually this date is costing me about eleven thousand dollars a month."
"LORELAI: Geez, I hope I'm worth it."
"ALEX: So far, so good."
"LORELAI: So you were telling me about Hillary and Jeff."
"ALEX: Right. Well, they live with their mom, but I get them quite a bit. They both recently started soccer because apparently it's the law."
"LORELAI: I know. Rory's still got an outstanding warrant on that one. So, how old are they?"
"ALEX: Six and nine."
"LORELAI: Good ages."
"ALEX: Haven't really hit a bad one yet."
"LORELAI: Me either. Although, with Rory, I think it's gonna be forty-three."
"ALEX: Really?"
"LORELAI: Not sure why, just have a feeling that's the year she's getting the mohawk. Mm, we like sharper. When you guys open your coffee place, this must be on the menu."
"ALEX: Yeah? Mm, that's sharper."
"LORELAI: So, let's see, we've covered work, kids. . .uh, shall we move onto hobbies?"
"ALEX: Not a hobby guy."
"LORELAI: Hallelujah."
"ALEX: Most of the time I'm working, with the kids, or I'm charming the chicks with the coffee. And then a few times a year, I'll go camping or fishing. I actually really love that stuff."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah?"
"ALEX: Absolutely. How about you?"
"LORELAI: Ah, there's a reason they call it the great outdoors, right?"
"ALEX: I was actually thinking of doing a little fishing this Saturday."
"LORELAI: Oh, that sounds like fun."
"ALEX: This great place, beautiful, perfect fishing. You wanna come?"
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"ALEX: I'd love to take you."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, sure. That would be nice."
"ALEX: Great, it's a date."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is a date. It is a fishing date."
"ALEX: Ready to try another? I hear there's one from Peru that comes with a Surgeon's General warning."
"LORELAI: Hey, if that last one didn't k*ll me, nothing will."
"ALEX: Be right back."
"CUT TO BUS STOP"
"[Rory gets off the bus; Lane runs up to her]"
"LANE: Rory! Rory! The numbers are all adding up, the planets are aligning, and I am going to my senior prom!"
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: Yes!"
"RORY: How?"
"LANE: Because I am brilliant. See, my mom was in a good mood today because she made a big sale  a dining room table and eight chairs, none of which matched, that have been hanging around the shop since I was four."
"RORY: Oh, I'm gonna miss those."
"LANE: Get over it. Anyway, I sat her down and I told her that I really wanted to go to the prom. And I know she doesn't approve of such things, but if she lets me go, we will do it her way."
"RORY: But her way would be not to let you go."
"LANE: Yes, she said that also. But then I went on to clarify that if she lets me go, she would get full dress approval, full chaperone approval, I promise not to actually dance at the prom, and whatever boy I go with will be required to attend at least four family dinners before she signs off on him being my escort."
"RORY: Nice move on using the word escort instead of the word date."
"LANE: The subliminal is half the battle, Rory."
"RORY: Go on, go on."
"LANE: So, she sat there, took it all in, and after a really long pause, she looks at me and says, ""Maybe."""
"RORY: You got a maybe from Mrs. Kim."
"LANE: I got a maybe from Mrs. Kim."
"[they walk into the beauty supply store]"
"LANE: Okay, let's start with base."
"RORY: Right. Now, we are talking Dave taking you to the prom, right?"
"LANE: Of course. My mom loves him. Last week she let him sit in our pew."
"RORY: No."
"LANE: She made me move."
"RORY: You've been replaced."
"LANE: I'd be offended if I weren't so busy doing a happy dance. It's all working out so perfectly. By the time she says yes, she'll love him even more and then when I say I wanna go to the prom with him, it'll be like she picked him out herself."
"RORY: You are brilliant. Hey, Kirk, is this waterproof?"
"KIRK: Water-resistant."
"RORY: Thanks."
"LANE: You know, she asked Dave to play at the wedding this weekend."
"RORY: I thought I was the only non-Korean allowed at the Kim family weddings."
"LANE: Don't be hurt. You have been to so many of these weddings, you are an honorary member of the clan now."
"RORY: I appreciate that. So, tell me, your cousin getting married Saturday, what's his story?"
"LANE: James. Very quiet, kind of skulky, couldn't meet anyone here, so his family arranged to have a girl shipped over from the old country."
"RORY: I hope they cut air holes in the box."
"LANE: She doesn't speak a word of English and she's never met him."
"RORY: Hm. Well, then she's gonna need some sparkles."
"LANE: Okay, I think that's it."
"RORY: Let's go. Can you imagine marrying someone you didn't know?"
"LANE: Are you kidding? Used clothes still skeeve me out a little."
"KIRK: Will this be all?"
"RORY: Yes. I like your display Kirk."
"KIRK: It is fun, isn't it? Okay, that's $40.42."
"LANE: Here."
"KIRK: I'm also including a few samples, a facial scrub and a honey mask. Very soothing, very healing."
"RORY: That's very nice."
"KIRK: Thank you for coming, and call me and tell me how you like that mask."
"RORY: We will."
"[they walk outside]"
"LANE: Okay, the wedding's at four, so how about you come over at one and we'll get her ready?"
"RORY: Deal."
"LANE: You know, Rory, I feel good. I feel like everything's going my way this time."
"RORY: I hope so."
"LANE: No, it is, I can feel it. Lane Kim is going to her prom."
"RORY: Maybe."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Sookie is frosting a cake, Lorelai is sitting next to her]"
"LORELAI: Dumb, dumb, dumb."
"SOOKIE: Oh, come on."
"LORELAI: Sure, I fish. I also bodysurf and walk on the moon without a space suit."
"SOOKIE: You were trying to impress him."
"LORELAI: Ugh."
"SOOKIE: What ugh? You like him."
"LORELAI: I like him, but I'm not sixteen. I don't lie to guys to make them like me. I just got stuck when he said fishing and camping, and I was trying to be nice and not say, ""Fishing? Great  cold, wet, and smelly. My three favorite things after those witches from Macbeth."""
"SOOKIE: Honey, we all do it. When Jackson and I first started dating, we went to this pickling festival, and he wore a shirt with a giant frog on it. So I'm trying to make conversation and I say, ""Hey, cute frog."" And he says, ""You like frogs?"" and I say, ""I love frogs!"" So, for our six-month anniversary, he gives me a frog figurine."
"LORELAI: Aw."
"SOOKIE: And then when Christmas came, he gave me another frog figurine. And then he told his family what to get me, and all of a sudden. . ."
"LORELAI: Your frog collection!"
"SOOKIE: I'm the frog girl."
"LORELAI: You never told him you don't love frogs?"
"SOOKIE: No. He has the best time buying them for me, so I just let him buy them."
"LORELAI: That's sweet. Maybe I could go fishing. Maybe. Once."
"SOOKIE: Tell me about Alex."
"LORELAI: Well, he owns an iron company. They do gates and statues, big fancy stuff. He's divorced, he has two kids he's crazy about. He's nice, he drinks a lot of coffee. It's all good, it all works."
"SOOKIE: So?"
"LORELAI: So. . .I'm going fishing. I'm the fish girl."
"SOOKIE: Frog girl welcomes you to the club!"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Students are gathering for the student council meeting]"
"LOUISE: I don't know what to do. It's time to break up, but he seems so happy."
"MADELINE: You could date his brother."
"LOUISE: I guess, but that's so been there, done that.'"
"MADELINE: We could switch."
"LOUISE: Isn't that how I got him?"
"MADELINE: Oh yeah. Wow, it really is time to go to college."
"ADVISOR: Rory, where is Paris?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"ADVISOR: She's almost fifteen minutes late."
"RORY: Is she?"
"ADVISOR: All right. Well, perhaps we should start without her. You can convene the meeting."
"RORY: Okay. If everyone will take their seats, we can call this meeting to order. All right, since Paris isn't here "
"PARIS: Paris is here. Couldn't wait to jump in there and take over, could you?"
"RORY: Tell it to the Timex salesman."
"PARIS: My gavel, please? I call this meeting to order."
"RORY: I already did that."
"PARIS: Sorry I'm late, but I had some very important business to attend to. Business which I must now, unfortunately, share with all of you. At the beginning of this year, when we were sworn in as your government representatives, we placed our hand on a bible and we took an oath. An oath that stated that our behavior would be ethically and morally upstanding for as long as we were serving in public office. And that is why it saddens me greatly today to inform you that one of our own has forsaken that holy oath."
"MADELINE: I hate anything that starts with a speech."
"ADVISOR: What are you talking about, Paris?"
"PARIS: I hold in my hand evidence accusing one Rory Gilmore of committing high crimes and misdemeanors."
"RORY: What?"
"ADVISOR: Paris, what's going on here?"
"PARIS: Miss Gilmore has been conspiring with the various factions of this school to weaken the efficacy of this administration."
"RORY: You're really pathetic, you know that?"
"PARIS: You'll have your chance to address these charges when I'm done."
"RORY: What charges?"
"PARIS: First on the list, espionage."
"RORY: Espionage?"
"PARIS: Gathering privileged information and divulging it to the enemy."
"RORY: What privileged information? Prom colors are green and pink, pass it on?"
"PARIS: Next on our list, the most serious crime  treason."
"RORY: I'm sorry I talked about Jamie."
"PARIS: And having a big mouth. That's going on the list also."
"RORY: I can't believe you're taking all of this out on me. What about Francie?"
"PARIS: Francie was not my second in command. Francie was not privy to the innermost workings of my personal. That is, not until you made her privy."
"RORY: Everyone in school saw you walking with Jamie, Paris."
"PARIS: I'm still talking."
"RORY: She already knew!"
"ADVISOR: Enough! We've heard enough."
"PARIS: I move to put to a vote the impeachment of Rory Gilmore."
"RORY: Hey!"
"ADVISOR: Miss Gellar, I'm sorry, but we do not impeach here at Chilton."
"PARIS: Why not?"
"ADVISOR: Because this is a student government."
"PARIS: Well, then, I'd like to put to a vote a resolution to instate the ability to impeach."
"ADVISOR: No."
"PARIS: Then she should resign."
"RORY: I'm not going to resign. You have the problem, you resign."
"PARIS: No, you resign!"
"RORY: No, you resign!"
"PARIS: No, you resign!"
"ADVISOR: No one is resigning."
"LOUISE: Maybe I'll stay with him til Friday and see how it goes."
"MADELINE: That sounds fair."
"ADVISOR: You two can take this argument somewhere else. This is student council. Real school matters are the only things that matter here. Now, Paris, move on."
"PARIS: The swimming pool needs re-plastering. Ideas for fundraising, please."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[A woman with a briefcase walks in]"
"NICOLE: Excuse me? Hi, I'm looking for a Mr. Lucas Danes."
"JESS: Oh, Lucas."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: IRS."
"NICOLE: I'm not IRS. I'm not IRS."
"LUKE: I'm Luke Danes."
"NICOLE: Luke Danes, sorry. Well, hello Luke Danes, I'm Nicole Leahy, I'm Taylor Doose's attorney."
"LUKE: Oh, geez."
"NICOLE: He wanted me to bring "
"LUKE: Yeah, the lease agreements, yes, I know. I told him to walk them over here, but hey, what's the fun of being Taylor, right?"
"NICOLE: I'm sorry if this is a bad time. It certainly won't take me very long."
"LUKE: Nah, I'm fine, whatever. Let's get this over with."
"NICOLE: No problem."
"LUKE: You want some coffee?"
"NICOLE: Yeah, sounds great. I really just need to witness your signature, is all. It's actually just a formality."
"LUKE: In other words, completely ridiculous and unnecessary."
"NICOLE: Uh huh."
"LUKE: Okay."
"NICOLE: Mr. Doose really likes things to be formal. And neat. And in triplicate. He just loves things in triplicate. That's a really good cup of coffee."
"LUKE: Thanks. So, tell me something, what's it like being Taylor's lawyer?"
"NICOLE: Well, actually, I'm not exactly Mr. Doose's lawyer. Or only lawyer. He's one of our select clients, so all of our attorneys deal with him or a rotating basis, it's my month."
"LUKE: My condolences."
"NICOLE: Yeah, my father always told me that which does not k*ll you makes you stronger."
"LUKE: You're gonna be really stronger."
"NICOLE: He's not that bad."
"LUKE: Seriously, if you run into someone pinned underneath a truck, pick it up. It's gonna be a piece of cake. Okay, looks like that's the whole nine yards."
"NICOLE: Great. You and Mr. Doose are officially in business together. Oh, I'm so sorry, I meant that as a good thing."
"LUKE: It's okay."
"NICOLE: Uh, I will let you get back to work. Let me. . ."
"LUKE: No, no, on me."
"NICOLE: Tell you what. It's business, let's let Mr. Doose pay for it."
"LUKE: Even better."
"[Nicole leaves]"
"JESS: Well, that was an interesting show."
"LUKE: What are you yammering about?"
"JESS: Guess Gloria Allred wants to go slumming."
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: She was totally coming onto you."
"LUKE: She was not."
"JESS: Couldn't you hear her panting when you were signing those things?"
"LUKE: Didn't see it."
"JESS: She laughed at your jokes, and we both know there's gotta be some ulterior motive when people laugh at your jokes."
"LUKE: Okay, whatever. Even if there was something, which I'm not saying there was, she's a suit. Not my type."
"JESS: Yeah, especially since she's not a monk."
"LUKE: Oh, I don't go out that much, is that what that's supposed to mean?"
"JESS: Take a look at a calendar. When was the last time you went out on a date? A year, two years ago?"
"LUKE: Last month, wiseass. I went out with Joanna Cooper."
"JESS: You gave her a ride home."
"LUKE: A ride home is the end of a date."
"JESS: Only if you go on a date first."
"LUKE: I'm not gonna discuss this with you."
"JESS: Suit yourself. I have to go meet Rory anyhow. See, I'm gonna go pick her up, spend a few hours actually being with her, then give her a ride home. That's called the end of a date."
"LUKE: Or I could stay open a few hours later which means you're here til ten. That's also called the end of a date."
"JESS: Hopeless."
"LUKE: Bye now."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table looking bored when Luke walks over]"
"LORELAI: Hey, got any good stories?"
"LUKE: Nope, sorry."
"LORELAI: Ah, nothing? No crazy, colorful uncle? Best friend with a funny name?"
"LUKE: Jeff Smith?"
"LORELAI: Skeletons in the family closet? w*r wounds? Funny shaped scars?"
"LUKE: It really throws you off when Rory's late, doesn't it?"
"LORELAI: Big time."
"[Rory walks into the diner]"
"LORELAI: Oh, yay, thank God!"
"RORY: Sorry. Didn't Luke keep you company?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he tried, but really, he's got nothing."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: So what's with all the books?"
"RORY: We are going to fish."
"LORELAI: With these?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: So we throw them in and try to knock the fish out?"
"RORY: I went to the library and got of all their best informational books on fishing."
"LORELAI: Ugh, you're serious."
"RORY: You wanna learn to fish or not? Exciting, huh?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I can barely keep still. [opens book] ""Chapter 1, technique. For deep water fishing, an angler  "" What's an angler?"
"RORY: That would be you."
"LORELAI: Oh, better remember that. Okay. ""For deep water fishing, an angler""  me, again  ""can choose a wire line using a downrigger or a vertical jig. Whatever your technique, the other successful clue to attracting fish is the appropriate lure."" Ooh, what about the sequined top I wore to the Christmas party?"
"RORY: Yes, I think that's exactly what he's talking about."
"LORELAI: ""For bottom feeders, consider smaller, darker patterned lures""  simple, yet elegant  ""while in areas where the forage fish are cicso, you're limited to the larger, more flashy baits."" I am telling you right now, the larger flashy baits are just gonna make me look cheap."
"RORY: Okay, let's review  what do we know so far?"
"LORELAI: I need flashy baits if I'm going to invest in cisco, unless I choose to cast a troll in my downrigger."
"RORY: Hey, that's good."
"LUKE: Doing a little studying?"
"RORY: My mom's leaning how to fish."
"LUKE: You're what?"
"LORELAI: I'm learning how to fish."
"LUKE: Oh, sorry, wrong inflection  you're what?"
"LORELAI: Go away."
"LUKE: Why are you learning how to fish?"
"LORELAI: Um, it's just something I wanted to do. Some friends of mine fish, and I thought if they can do it I can do it."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: And what if I am a really great fisher? Yeah, I mean, what if that's my calling, the thing that I am meant to do? And all this time I've been sitting here with the gift to fish and I am squandering it. It's like if Mozart walked right by the piano store and never played a note."
"LUKE: So you're gonna fish to fulfill your destiny?"
"LORELAI: That's right."
"LUKE: And you're gonna learn to fish to fulfill your destiny from a book?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"LUKE: And you sanctioned this?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LUKE: Okay, Thelma, Louise, possibly there's another way to learn to fish."
"LORELAI: The Fishing Channel."
"LUKE: I fish."
"RORY: Oh yeah, we've seen those boots thingies outside drying off."
"LUKE: Those would be called waders."
"LORELAI: And I'm sure I'll be reading about waders soon in one of these cliffhangers here."
"LUKE: If you want, I can show you a few things, get you started, make sure you don't strangle yourself with your own line, the basics."
"LORELAI: Are you sure you don't mind?"
"LUKE: I can come over tomorrow after work."
"LORELAI: Great, thank you. Agh. Just for the record, I don't wanna learn that."
"LUKE: Got it."
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory walks into the secretary's office]"
"RORY: I got a note that I was supposed to come see Headmaster Charleston."
"SECRETARY: I'll let him know you're both here."
"RORY: Both?"
"PARIS: Both."
"RORY: Both."
"SECRETARY: Take a seat, please."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am. [sits down next to Paris] So what this time, trying to have me deported?"
"PARIS: Oh, yeah, like I'm the one who called this meeting."
"RORY: I certainly didn't call this meeting."
"PARIS: Save the act for Sundance, you little snitch."
"RORY: I didn't snitch."
"PARIS: Said the weak-kneed turncoat."
"RORY: Nixon's bad seed."
"PARIS: Daughter of Judas."
"HEADMASTER: Ladies, come in please."
"[they walk into the office]"
"HEADMASTER: Have a seat. Chilton student council president and vice president in my office. . . not what I would've expected, I must tell you. There's been quite a stir about you two the past several days. The school is buzzing with the talk of your clashes in student council meetings, your face-offs in the cafeteria, a screaming match at the school newspaper's office."
"PARIS: Excuse me, Headmaster Charleston, in regards to the incident at the Franklin, Ms. Gilmore submitted a piece that was quite poorly researched."
"RORY: It was not poorly researched."
"PARIS: I had to re-edit it and Ms. Gilmore took it very badly."
"RORY: There was nothing wrong with the piece."
"PARIS: And in regards to the student council meeting "
"RORY: Oh, you mean the one where you tried to impeach me because you haven't been properly diagnosed yet?"
"PARIS: If you'll just allow me access to my briefs "
"RORY: You know what, you want me to quit? Fine, I'll quit. I never wanted this stupid job in the first place."
"PARIS: Who forced you to take it then?"
"RORY: You did, because you didn't think you'd get elected unless I ran with you."
"PARIS: That's not true!"
"RORY: It's completely true!"
"PARIS: Shut up!"
"RORY: No, you shut up!"
"HEADMASTER: Enough! This behavior will stop this instant. It is disgraceful, especially from the political leaders of this campus. Now, I'd like to know what is actually driving this recent rash of infighting. Oh, goody, I get to guess. Well, let's see, perhaps you're arguing over the same boy?"
"PARIS: Sure, we're girls, so we could only be arguing about a boy, right? Sexist, white-haired "
"HEADMASTER: Paris, are you muttering?"
"PARIS: No, sorry."
"HEADMASTER: All right, if it isn't a boy, perhaps it's a popularity thing. Someone didn't get invited to someone else's party? Or perhaps this is a power struggle of some sort. No? Well, then I'll stop guessing and start lecturing. Ms. Gilmore, you will not be quitting the student council, is that clear?"
"RORY: Yes, sir."
"HEADMASTER: The student body has elected you and therefore you will fulfill your commitment. And in the future, I would advise you to think long and hard about accepting any responsibility if you intend to run away from it at the first sign of conflict. And Ms. Gellar, you worked very hard to get to the position you hold in this school, and yet now you are willing to throw all that away on petty vendettas and childish antics. Indeed, it makes me wonder. . .if you two can't resolve your issues in this sheltered  some would say pampered  environment, how on Earth will you ever survive in college? As student council officers, you represent Chilton to those inside and outside these hallowed halls. Right now, the world sees us as a group of sniveling, spiteful, vindictive individuals  not really what I'd hoped for, nor is that how I portrayed the two of you in my personal letter of recommendation to Harvard. I would hate to have to write a second letter to the university correcting my errors in judgment. However, I've done it before. Am I making myself clear?"
"RORY: Yes, sir."
"PARIS: Yes, sir."
"HEADMASTER: Delightful. You may see yourselves out."
"[Rory and Paris walk into the hallway]"
"RORY: Well, that was delightful, wasn't it? I'm not sure which is more embarrassing  having Charleston yell at us or knowing we actually had a ""shut up/no, you shut up"" fight in front of him. So, what do you think, Paris? Do you feel as completely rotten as I do?"
"PARIS: No."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Luke is unloading his fishing gear out of his truck. He honks the horn and Lorelai walks out of the house]"
"LUKE: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Hello, sailor, bait your hook for you?"
"LUKE: You look ridiculous."
"LORELAI: I look adorable. No one ever told me that if you fish, you get to buy an outfit. I'll do just about anything if I can buy an outfit."
"LUKE: Well, I'll just let that go by because we have a lot to do here."
"LORELAI: Okay, wait. I'll just get my purse before we go."
"LUKE: Go where?"
"LORELAI: To the lake."
"LUKE: You're not ready for the lake."
"LORELAI: Then what am I ready for?"
"[Luke points to the small inflatable pool he has set up in the yard]"
"LORELAI: Uh! You're putting me in the kiddie lake?"
"LUKE: Gotta crawl before you can walk."
"LORELAI: Oh, this is not at all embarrassing. There's not even fish in it."
"[Luke dumps a bucket of fish into the pool]"
"LUKE: Trout."
"LORELAI: Hey! Aw, they're so cute! Hello, hi boys. And look, they're all ""ooh"" like they're singing in a little trout choir."
"LUKE: I wouldn't get too attached."
"LORELAI: Hi Gomer."
"LUKE: There you go."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't be scared Pinky."
"LUKE: And now there's Pinky."
"LORELAI: Pinky Dowdy from fourth grade. See her eyes darting back and forth, all panicked? She got that way from dodge ball. It's okay, Pinky, nobody's gonna hurt you. Hey Pete, stop crowding Pinky. It's okay, Pinky, just go over there behind Cheryl."
"LUKE: Okay, now that everybody knows each other, take this."
"LORELAI: What's that?"
"LUKE: That's your rod and reel."
"LORELAI: Huh, rod and reel. I don't know if the guys are gonna like this."
"LUKE: Well, we can skip the lesson and just take the trout out for some beers. It's up to you, really."
"LORELAI: No, I'm going to learn."
"LUKE: Okay. I already went ahead and threaded your line through the guides here, and put a hook on it."
"LORELAI: What kind of bait is that?"
"LUKE: It's a cork."
"LORELAI: Remind me not to let you cater any of my parties."
"LUKE: It's to cover the hook. Okay, now, this little metal thing is the bail. It's very important. It keeps your line on the spool here."
"LORELAI: Line on the spool, got it."
"LUKE: Okay, take the rod in your right hand, and you press your right index finger on the line, holding it against the pole. With your left hand, slide the bail over. Now don't let go of your index finger or all the line will spin off your spool. Now, pull the pole back over your shoulder to the ten o'clock position."
"LORELAI: Oh, great, now I gotta go buy a watch."
"LUKE: You flip your wrist forward to two o'clock, at the same time releasing your index finger, casting your line out into the lake in front of you. Now, you try."
"[hands her the fishing pole]"
"LORELAI: Okay. Now, I do something with my right hand, my right index finger, and with the bail and a spool, and pull the thingy. . ."
"[she accidentally casts the line backwards]"
"LORELAI: Oh! Now, that would've been embarrassing if I weren't dressed like this."
"LUKE: Oh, you released at eleven, you're supposed to release at two o'clock. Try again."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Lorelai casts the line again]"
"LORELAI: Ah! Hey, I made it in the pool, I made it in the pool!"
"LUKE: I see that."
"LORELAI: Why aren't you excited?"
"LUKE: I'm very excited."
"LORELAI: Well, jump around or something."
"LUKE: All right, you know, you're going in the pool."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"LUKE: All right, what do you think? Ready to take the cork off and try your luck?"
"LORELAI: Uh, uh, I'm ready, but they're not."
"LUKE: No problem."
"LORELAI: Man, you need a lot of stuff for fishing."
"LUKE: Well, normally, you don't bring your own lake."
"LORELAI: Right, right."
"LUKE: So, tell me why you're doing this."
"LORELAI: Because you told me to."
"LUKE: I mean, tell me why you're learning to fish."
"LORELAI: Oh. I told you, some of my friends are going."
"LUKE: What friends? Sookie?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Is Sookie going fishing?"
"LORELAI: Well "
"LUKE: Or Rory  did Rory suddenly get the overwhelming urge to dig for worms and stand in the middle of a lake at five a.m.?"
"LORELAI: Yes? Okay, fine, I met this guy."
"LUKE: Ah."
"LORELAI: And, uh, he's kind of an outdoorsy guy."
"LUKE: Oh, just your type."
"LORELAI: No, not exactly, but he's nice and, uh, he was talking about fishing, and I think I said something like, Oh, hey, that sounds great', and so he invited me and here I am."
"LUKE: I got it."
"LORELAI: Sorry I didn't tell you."
"LUKE: Why didn't you tell me?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I just felt stupid getting rooked into the thing in the first place, and then. . .plus, you don't wanna hear about my personal life."
"LUKE: So this'll be your first date or. . ."
"LORELAI: Second."
"LUKE: Second date."
"LORELAI: He took me to this coffee tasting place."
"LUKE: Coffee tasting, just your type."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"LUKE: Well, I think that's great."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"LUKE: Yeah. When are you going?"
"LORELAI: Sunday morning."
"LUKE: Oh. Well, it's hard to be a fisher woman without your own pole. You can borrow one of mine if you want."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I got an extra little tackle box, too. . . if you want."
"LORELAI: That would be great."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Can you do me one more favor?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: Put a cork on your hook."
"LUKE: Sure."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is resting her head on the kitchen table]"
"LORELAI: [from other room] Could you please just make some coffee?"
"RORY: I'm not doing anything for you ever."
"LORELAI: Don't be mad."
"RORY: You set my alarm for 5:15 a.m."
"LORELAI: [walking into the kitchen] I know, and I did it for purely practical reasons."
"RORY: Which are?"
"LORELAI: My alarm is just not as reliable as your scream."
"RORY: You will pay."
"LORELAI: That's fine, honey. Now, coffee?"
"RORY: I am writing this in my ledger of all the crummy things you've done over the years, and when I leave this house, mark my words  you will pay!"
"[doorbell rings]"
"LORELAI: Oh great. It's 5:30 a.m., and I have no coffee in my system."
"[Lorelai answers the door.]"
"ALEX: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"ALEX: [holds up a bag] Coffee and donuts."
"LORELAI: Ah, I like you. Come on in. Right in here. [they walk to the living room] This is Rory."
"ALEX: Hi, I'm Alex."
"RORY: Nice to meet you. Would've been nicer in the daylight, but. . ."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's get going. It's not like the fish are gonna wait for us all day, right? I'll take that coffee now. Thank you. I got it, I got it."
"[Lorelai walks toward the front door]"
"ALEX: Your mom's never been fishing before, has she?"
"RORY: Oh, no, she's a well-seasoned fish k*ll."
"ALEX: Uh huh. I made lunch reservations at the Shahaela Lodge and Spa afterward. Think she'll like that?"
"RORY: She'll love that."
"ALEX: Good. Go back to sleep."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[Guests are mingling before the wedding]"
"MRS. KIM: Min Jae, you lost weight. Look good, not so fat."
"MIN JAE: Thank you."
"[Mrs. Kim sees Lane carrying a tray of water glasses]"
"MRS. KIM: What is that?"
"LANE: The bride's thirsty."
"MRS. KIM: Regulate the water. Once the dress is on, that's it  must remain standing."
"[Lane walks over to Dave]"
"LANE: Hi."
"DAVE: Hi, and hi."
"LANE: Uh, this will not be the mental image you carry around of me the rest of the week."
"DAVE: No, it won't. Hold on, I just saw the back. Yes, it will."
"MRS. KIM: Why aren't you upstairs? It's not right to leave the bride alone on her wedding day."
"LANE: Uh, Rory's up there, Mama, and I'm going up there right now. Dave Rygalski was just wondering where to set up."
"MRS. KIM: David, hello."
"DAVE: Hello, Mrs. Kim. The place looks wonderful."
"MRS. KIM: Thank you. Come, sit here. This is Ho Kyung, she'll sing with you."
"DAVE: Hi."
"MRS. KIM: Watch the high notes, she's a runner."
"CUT TO LANE'S BEDROOM"
"[Rory is fixing the bride's hair when Lane walks in]"
"LANE: How's it going?"
"RORY: I like it, but I'm not the one getting married. [to bride] Um, your hair, do you like it?"
"[Lane asks her in Korean, and the lady responds in Korean]"
"LANE: Too much for me."
"RORY: Oh, I found the Mrs. Kim-approved makeup in the drawer, but let me tell you, since the last wedding, it has developed a smell."
"LANE: A what? Oh boy."
"RORY: As I said, a smell."
"[Lane retrieves some makeup from under her floorboard]"
"LANE: Well, I've got the good stuff right here, right next to the Peggy Lee."
"RORY: Seems appropriate."
"LANE: I thought so. Shall we?"
"RORY: Unh unh, the foot stool."
"LANE: Whoa. All set. So, Dave's here."
"RORY: He is, huh?"
"LANE: I still can't believe he's willing to do all this just to go out with me."
"RORY: Well, hey, where else can he find a decent, pretty, smart girl who can recite the entire encyclopedia of rock in 5/8 time?"
"LANE: Nowhere, I guess."
"RORY: I'm really happy for you guys."
"LANE: Thanks. I'm really happy for you and Jess, too."
"RORY: Thanks. You know it's okay, right?"
"LANE: Not following."
"RORY: It's okay not to like Jess."
"LANE: I said I was happy for you."
"RORY: I know."
"LANE: God, I'm such a jerk."
"RORY: You're not. Look, we're not always going to like the same things. Like, you like Smashing Pumpkins and I don't."
"LANE: But that's only cause you're close-minded and blind."
"RORY: What can I say? They're not my angst."
"LANE: Besides, it's not like I don't want to like Jess. I can't help it. As your best friend, I'm very protective of you."
"RORY: You could try giving him a second chance."
"LANE: I could. I should. I will. Um, hey, maybe we can all go out sometime together as a group, you know, you, me, Dave, Jess."
"RORY: Absolutely, we should do that sometime."
"LANE: Great. [the door starts to open] Incoming!"
"[Rory pushes the makeup off the vanity as Mrs. Kim walks into the room]"
"MRS. KIM: What's going on in here?"
"LANE: Nothing, Mama."
"RORY: I fell off my chair."
"LANE: Oh, well, don't."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am."
"MRS. KIM: She looks very beautiful. Must've gotten a good night sleep."
"[Mrs. Kim leaves the room]"
"RORY: How many people do you think have gotten married here over the years?"
"LANE: I counted once off the guest book  forty-six."
"RORY: Wow. What happened to that one, Min Cha? She married a real mean guy."
"LANE: Wan Nam. Didn't I tell you about them?"
"RORY: No."
"LANE: Well, Min Cha put up with seven years of Wan Nam telling her she was stupid and ordering her to cook all his meals. Then one day, he was in the kitchen looking for his lunch and she just snapped. Took a carrot peeler and turned on him."
"RORY: A carrot peeler?"
"LANE: You can get those things pretty sharp. Anyway, she just came at him and started peeling. The neighbors called the police. They showed up and Wan Nam was just standing there all peeled."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LANE: He didn't press charges, but now he makes all his own meals, sleeps in a locked separate room, and keeps the cutting board by his bed for protection. Still married, though."
"RORY: Wow."
"LANE: Everybody's still married. It's like a factory system here. They all come to the weddings, find a spouse, get married and stay that way til they die."
"RORY: They mate for life, like the loons."
"LANE: You know, this may be the last wedding for a long time, though."
"RORY: How come?"
"LANE: Well, all my cousins in their twenties and thirties are married. James was the last one."
"RORY: Wow. It feels like we've had at least two of these every year since I can remember."
"LANE: Elementary school, when we met."
"RORY: Elementary school, when we met, yeah."
"LANE: Well, we do have some distant relatives left. Maybe we can go to one of those weddings. You know, when we come home from college on break or something."
"RORY: Well, then, we should definitely keep the makeup."
"LANE: We definitely should."
"RORY: And who knows, maybe the next Kim wedding we do makeup for will be yours."
"LANE: Too scary, don't freak me out."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LANE: So, what do you think, eye shadow?"
"RORY: Why not? Let's do it. Peeled to death  that's a bad way to go."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke looks out the window and sees Taylor talking to his lawyer. They wave to each other.]"
"LUKE: [to customer] Here you go. We'll top that off for ya. [to Jess] Coffee over here."
"JESS: Where you going?"
"[Luke walks out of the diner]"
"LUKE: Uh, Miss Leahy?"
"NICOLE: Yeah? Mr. Danes, how are you?"
"LUKE: Good, good, and it's Luke."
"NICOLE: Okay, Luke. What can I do for you?"
"LUKE: I wouldn't cross there."
"NICOLE: Why not?"
"LUKE: Well, Taylor's a stickler about jaywalking and he's town magistrate. I'd hate for you to be disbarred."
"NICOLE: Well, that would be a bad way to end a career, thank you."
"LUKE: Sure. So, uh, did the lease forms all work out? I mean, was my signature okay? Cause sometimes I'm in a kind of a hurry and my hand just takes off without me."
"NICOLE: Your signature seemed very steady."
"LUKE: Good, good, cause you never know."
"NICOLE: Well "
"LUKE: Listen, I was thinking about that cup of coffee you had at my place the other day. I felt bad making Taylor pay for it  not that I ever feel bad sticking it to Taylor. I just thought it might get you in trouble with a client. I'd hate to see you disbarred again."
"NICOLE: To be honest, I actually paid for the coffee myself."
"LUKE: Oh, oh, well, then at least let me pay you back for it."
"NICOLE: You wanna give me seventy-five cents?"
"LUKE: No, no, no, uh, what I meant was  ah, what the hell? Would you like to have dinner with me sometime?"
"NICOLE: Yeah."
"LUKE: Really?"
"NICOLE: I'd love to have dinner with you."
"LUKE: Great. Okay, uh, well, I have your card."
"NICOLE: Mmhmm."
"LUKE: Why don't I give you a call this week and we'll make that happen."
"NICOLE: Sounds good."
"LUKE: Yeah, sounds good. So, see ya. Watch those crosswalks."
"NICOLE: Thanks, I will."
"[Luke walks back into the diner]"
"LUKE: Shut up."
"JESS: I said nothing."
"LUKE: Well, don't."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[The wedding has started.]"
"PRIEST: [speaks Korean to bride]"
"BRIDE: [answers in Korean]"
"PRIEST: [to groom] And do you vow to uphold the principles of the seventh commandment as set out in Exodus 20:14?"
"JAMES: I do."
"PRIEST: [speaks Korean] [pause] And so, in the Glory of God, I pronounce you husband and wife."
"RORY: That was nice."
"LANE: Yeah, it was really nice"
"MRS. KIM: Reception at Elks Lodge. Two hundred guests. Food goes fast. Let's move."
"RORY: I can't believe that's the last time I'll hear your mom say that."
"LANE: So, are you coming to the reception?"
"RORY: Oh, no, I was actually going to "
"LANE: Go meet Jess."
"RORY: Yeah. Are you mad?"
"LANE: No. You know, he can come to the reception with you if. . . he's not really the reception kind of guy, is he?"
"RORY: Not really. Not yet, anyway."
"LANE: We'll work on that."
"RORY: Yes, we will."
"LANE: Okay, tell him hi for me."
"RORY: I will. Tell Dave hi for me."
"LANE: I will."
"RORY: Bye."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Rory leaves]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: Yes, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: This is Young Chui."
"LANE: Hi."
"YOUNG CHUI: Hi."
"MRS. KIM: He will take you to the prom."
"LANE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: Young Chui works for his father who builds Adventist hospitals. Young Chui will go to college at Loma Linda University. Then he will return to work for his father building Adventist hospitals. Now, put your coat on. Young Chui and his parents will drive you to Elks Lodge. [walks away]"
"LANE: Mama! [to Young Chui] I'm sure you're very nice."
"[Lane follows Mrs. Kim to the kitchen]"
"MRS. KIM: [to wedding guests] Not a bus stop, door's that way."
"LANE: I have to talk to you."
"MRS. KIM: Get your coat, we have to go."
"LANE: No."
"MRS. KIM: No?"
"LANE: I can't go to the prom with Young Chui."
"MRS. KIM: Why not? I thought you wanted to go to the prom."
"LANE: Yes, I do wanna go to the prom."
"MRS. KIM: I thought you say I could approve the boy you go to the prom with."
"LANE: I did say that, but -"
"MRS. KIM: Well, I found the boy, I approve the boy, now you go to the prom with the boy."
"LANE: Mama, um, I'm sure  I'm sure Young Chui's very nice and I'm so grateful you're letting me go to the prom, but the thing is  I like someone else."
"MRS. KIM: Someone else?"
"LANE: Yes."
"MRS. KIM: Someone else who?"
"LANE: Someone else who's been a good friend to this family. Who's proven himself to be of high moral character, someone who you yourself feels is worthy. So worthy, in fact, you let him sit in our pew at church."
"MRS. KIM: Who  who did I let sit in our pew?"
"LANE: Dave Rygalski."
"MRS. KIM: The guitar player?"
"LANE: I know, crazy, right? I can hardly believe it myself because, to be quite honest with you, when I first met him, when you hired him to play at Thanksgiving, well, I just didn't like him at all. He bugged me, actually. But the more you liked him and trusted him, the more I saw the good in him, the God in him, actually, and now I'm convinced. . . he's the boy I want to take me to prom."
"MRS. KIM: He's not Korean."
"[cut to front hallway]"
"DAVE: Lane? Hey, Lane? Is everything all right?"
"LANE: You're not Korean."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks through the front door]"
"RORY: I'm home!"
"LORELAI: [from upstairs] Upstairs, bathroom!"
"CUT TO UPSTAIRS BATHROOM"
"[Lorelai is watching a fish swim in the bath tub; Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hey. [sees the fish] Oh, no."
"LORELAI: Isn't she cute?"
"RORY: What happened?"
"LORELAI: The cork fell off my hook and Jayne Mansfield over here bit."
"RORY: Jayne Mansfield."
"LORELAI: Not the brightest fish in the pond, but she's awfully pretty."
"RORY: You caught a fish."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: And you brought it home."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: How are you gonna take a bath?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: How long is it gonna live?"
"LORELAI: Hard to say."
"RORY: What are you gonna feed it?"
"LORELAI: See, this is why I don't fish."
"RORY: She is kinda cute."
"LORELAI: And she has a great tail swish."
"RORY: So, other than bringing home a pet, how was fishing?"
"LORELAI: Good. The lake was beautiful, snowy and sparkly, and right down the road from the Shahaela Lodge and Spa."
"RORY: I knew that."
"LORELAI: How could you already know that?"
"RORY: Alex told me when you guys left."
"LORELAI: Two dates with this guy and you're already in cahoots with each other."
"RORY: Ah, what can I say? I'm wily."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: So, are you going out with him again?"
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RORY: Camping?"
"LORELAI: Unh unh."
"RORY: Good. So do you think maybe we should try to rehabilitate her and send her back into the wild?"
"LORELAI: Unfortunately, I think she's already domesticated. Baths and scented candles."
"RORY: We'll just have to keep her."
"LORELAI: Maybe we can train her to do tricks."
"RORY: Tomorrow. Night Jayne."
"LORELAI: Night Jayne."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Richard and Emily are sitting in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Mom, I swear, it was Aunt Maureen."
"EMILY: Aunt Maureen would never hike up her skirt in public."
"LORELAI: She would after half a gallon of eggnog."
"EMILY: Richard, who was the one who got drunk at our Christmas party and hiked up her skirt in front of the Town and Country photographer?"
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, did you say something?"
"LORELAI: I don't know about you, Mom, but I've never felt so fascinating in my entire life."
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: I'm so sorry I'm late. Hi Grandma, Hi Grandma."
"RICHARD: Hello Rory."
"LORELAI: Oh, now he closes the paper."
"RORY: Hey, Mom, I stopped by the bookstore on the way here."
"LORELAI: You got them?"
"RORY: I got them!"
"EMILY: Got what?"
"LORELAI: Rory and I are starting to plan our Europe trip."
"RORY: The day after graduation, we are gone."
"RICHARD: Well, that sounds very exciting."
"EMILY: Lorelai, what are these?"
"LORELAI: Those are guidebooks."
"EMILY: ""Europe Through the Backdoor."" ""The Rough Guide to Europe."" What kind of guidebooks are these?"
"LORELAI: The cheap kind."
"RORY: They have all the good information about backpacking and staying in hostels."
"EMILY: Backpacking and staying in hostels?"
"RICHARD: Who's backpacking and staying in hostels?"
"LORELAI: We are."
"[Emily and Richard laugh]"
"EMILY: No, you're not."
"RICHARD: What a ridiculous thought."
"RORY: We are. We're going to backpack around Europe."
"EMILY: Yes, I know, it's fun to tease your grandmother, dear. They're going to backpack across Europe, Richard."
"RICHARD: I heard, sounds delightful. Perhaps we should join them."
"EMILY: That sounds wonderful. Tomorrow I'll go out and buy some cutoffs."
"LORELAI: Guys, we're not kidding."
"EMILY: You're telling me you're seriously going to traipse across Europe with your possessions strapped to your back and sleep in a room with thirty other people?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RICHARD: No."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"RICHARD: It's not safe. I forbid it. Call our travel agent."
"RORY: But we want to be spontaneous. Jump a train to Paris, head off to Spain."
"LORELAI: Oh no, it's raining in Spain. But since the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain. . ."
"RORY: Looks like Italy for us!"
"LORELAI: Mamma mia!"
"RICHARD: You can still travel around aimlessly and stay in a decent hotel."
"LORELAI: We wanna do it cheap."
"EMILY: We'll pay."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Grandma, it's going to be fun, really."
"LORELAI: Kids do this all the time."
"EMILY: Yes, but you're not a kid, you're a grown woman. What are people going to think when they see a grown woman bunking down with a bunch of twenty-year-olds?"
"LORELAI: Well, if the twenty-year-olds are cute, they'll probably think, ""Lucky!"""
"RORY: Grandma, don't be upset. It really is going to be great."
"EMILY: [reads from book] What's so traumatic about a night without a bed anyway? My survey shows those who have had the opportunity to be a refugee for a night have their perspectives broaden and actually enjoy the experience."" Richard, this book is encouraging them to sleep in a park like a squirrel."
"LORELAI: It's okay, Mom."
"EMILY: My first trip to Europe, I went to Paris and stayed at the Ritz."
"LORELAI: Well, I tell you what, if it'll make you happy, we'll go to Paris and eat out of their dumpster."

"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[The construction crew is working in front of the soda shop]"
"TOM: All of this goes in there. Let's move, we're getting backlogged."
"DEAN: Tom, I brought over the nails you asked for."
"TOM: Good. Get the guy's lunch orders, will ya?"
"DEAN: Already done."
"TOM: You're a good kid, Dean. You hardly bug me at all."
"DEAN: High praise."
"TOM: Yeah, yeah, go, get the food. And don't forget the pickles."
"DEAN: I wouldn't dare."
"TOM: Oh, what do I gotta say to get this crap inside where it belongs? You got a language I'm not privy to? Cause I'm a fast learner."
"MISS PATTY: Dean-o, Dean-o, Dean-o. If you grow any taller, I'm gonna have to get myself some mountain climbing equipment."
"DEAN: You're getting dangerous to even walk near, you know that, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: I've been told."
"DEAN: You looking for Mr. Doose?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, precious, no. I'm just looking."
"DEAN: Ah."

"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is leaning on the counter, reading a book]"
"JESS: Move."
"LUKE: What? Oh, sorry."
"JESS: What's that?"
"LUKE: It's nothing."
"JESS: You reading?"
"LUKE: It's nothing."
"JESS: I never see you reading."
"LUKE: Will you just. . .I read."
"JESS: What are you reading?"
"LUKE: I read, I read."
"JESS: What do you read?"
"LUKE: Invoices, expiration dates."
"JESS: I stand corrected. [takes Luke's book]"
"LUKE: Hey!"
"JESS: ""Hidden Romantic Gems of the Restaurant World."" Well, well, well."
"LUKE: I would like my property back, please."
"JESS: Planning something special?"
"LUKE: No, nothing special. I'm just taking Nicole to dinner on Friday and I wanna find a place."
"JESS: A place you don't normally go to?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"JESS: So a special place."
"LUKE: Will you stop saying that word, please? And yes."
"JESS: Find anything good?"
"LUKE: Every single description in here talks about tablecloths and dish design, nothing about the food."
"JESS: You are really going through an awful lot for this lawyer."
"LUKE: She's not a lawyer. I mean, yes, she's a lawyer, but she's also a lady, and a very nice lady who probably expects good food with her fancy plates and sparse yet elegant décor."
"JESS: You're pathetic when you're in love."
"LUKE: I'm not in love, I'm dating. This is what you do when you're dating."
"JESS: It's not what I do when I'm dating."
"LUKE: Well, Rory's a lucky girl. Work. I'm going upstairs."
"JESS: Fine, but if a horse-drawn carriage shows up here, my throwing up will be eternal."
"[Dean walks up to the counter]"
"DEAN: I gotta place an order."
"JESS: Talk into the clown."
"DEAN: I am."
"JESS: What do you want?"
"DEAN: Six burgers, three with cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss. Two plain, one with chili, cheese and onions on the side. Your memory's that good?"
"JESS: You're screwing with me."
"DEAN: I'm placing an order."
"JESS: For all of Connecticut?"
"DEAN: For the construction crew next door."
"JESS: Oh, you're Taylor's errand boy now."
"DEAN: And you're Taylor's waitress."
"JESS: Say that a little closer."
"DEAN: I thought you had a girlfriend."
"JESS: Give me your order and get out."
"DEAN: Service with a smile. Uh, six burgers, three cheese -- two cheddar, one Swiss. Two plain burgers, one chili burger with cheese and onions on the side. Three ham on ryes - one mayo, one mustard, one combo. A combo means mustard and "
"JESS: I know what a combo means."
"DEAN: Sorry, guess that confused look is just how your face is."
"JESS: Do you wanna talk about this outside?"
"DEAN: Just as soon as I'm finished. Uh, four hot dogs. Two egg salads on white. One chicken salad on wheat. A chef's salad with ranch. Five fries. Five onion rings. Two chips. Extra pickles."
"JESS: On what?"
"DEAN: Excuse me?"
"JESS: What are the extra pickles on?"
"DEAN: On the side."
"JESS: On the side of what? On the side of the burgers, on the side of the sandwiches, or on the side of the road where the ditch I'm gonna dump your body into is?"
"DEAN: Just make sure there's enough for everyone."
"JESS: Fine."
"DEAN: Aren't you gonna read it back?"
"JESS: Nope."
"DEAN: Okay, but these men were hired by Taylor, which means if they aren't satisfied with their orders, they will send them back. And they will continue to send them back until they are happy, which means you could be making this order until you die."
"JESS: Six burgers, three with cheese  two cheddar, one Swiss."
"DEAN: Slower, please. I'm checking them off as we go."
"JESS: Two plain burgers, one chili with cheese and onion on the side."

"[Lorelai is at the front desk on the phone]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Hey, it's your party, we just want you to be happy. Okay. No problem. All right, I'll talk to you then. [hangs up] Ridgemont called."
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: He's changing his mind about the theme for his retirement party again."
"MICHEL: No!"
"LORELAI: We have to call the florist."
"MICHEL: But this is the fourth theme he's picked. He had the fishing one, and the Kentucky Derby with the chocolate horsies, and the Tibet with the Richard Gere pictures everywhere."
"LORELAI: I know."
"MICHEL: And he promised that the golf would be the last one."
"LORELAI: Well, he decided that golf was dull and he doesn't want to be remembered as dull."
"MICHEL: Would he like to be remembered as limping, because I can be a fabulous help with that."
"[They walk to the dining room, where workers are decorating the room in a golf theme]"
"LORELAI: Hey, guys. . ."
"[Everyone groans]"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."
"MICHEL: Here's an idea  it's a retirement party, yes? Okay. So what happens after you retire? You die."
"LORELAI: He changed his mind."
"LANE: Again?"
"MICHEL: So, why don't we dig a big hole, throw him in, hand everybody a shovel, they take turns covering him up. We go inside, have dinner, the wife gets used to eating alone. . ."
"LORELAI: We are not going to bury him alive."
"MICHEL: Well, fine then. What is the new theme?"
"LORELAI: He is calling me back at four."
"RORY: I got the flags and. . .he changed his mind again."
"LANE: He's worse than my mother at the Glory of Easter T-shirt stand."
"LORELAI: You kept the receipt, I hope."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: Good God, this party is gonna be the death of me."
"MICHEL: Or someone."
"LORELAI: Go call the florist."
"RORY: You're stressed."
"LORELAI: You're observant."
"RORY: Well, I was going to save this for later, but you look like you need it now."
"LORELAI: What's that?"
"RORY: I have been cordially invited to Sherry Tinsdale's C-section."
"LORELAI: No way!"
"RORY: [reads from invitation] Friday, February seventh, six o'clock p.m. Join the girls for a toast, a hug, a wave to the mommy as they wheel her off, dinner at Sushi Sushi, and then back to the hospital for a formal viewing of brand-new baby Georgia. RSVP at your earliest convenience. P.S. -- gifts are not necessary, but always appreciated."
"LORELAI: I don't even know where to start."
"RORY: I knew you would like it."
"LORELAI: You have to RSVP to a C-section."
"RORY: And bring a gift."
"LORELAI: I wonder if Laura Mercier makes Demerol."
"RORY: You wanna keep it?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, please."
"RORY: But don't lose it. I need the phone number."
"LORELAI: So, are you going?"
"RORY: Well, I don't know. I mean, I know it's weird, but I kind of wanna see Georgia. She's sort of my sister."
"LORELAI: She's more than sort of your sister."
"RORY: I just think it would be cool to meet her the night that she's born. It's a good story to talk about."
"LORELAI: You should go."
"RORY: I should, shouldn't I?"
"LORELAI: And you should take pictures and wear a hidden microphone cause I wanna hear everything."
"RORY: I'll see what I can do."
"LORELAI: Oh, sh**t."
"[Lorelai walks to the kitchen, where Sookie is frosting a golf ball cake]"
"LORELAI: Sook. . ."
"[Sookie flips the cake into the garbage can]"
"SOOKIE: God!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the house with boxes of Beanie Babies]"
"RORY: I just need to go on record that a grown man should not throw himself a Beanie Baby retirement party."
"LORELAI: Just hold your breath this one actually takes."
"RORY: And how is Sookie supposed to plan a Beanie Baby menu?"
"LORELAI: Lots of beans."
"RORY: I think this is ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Angel face, you need to learn that there are going to be times in your life when you have to do ridiculous things for money. If you're Adrian Zmed, that includes everything that ever happens in your whole career. [sees a box on the porch] Oh Rory, come on. Did you order from Amazon again? 'Cause we're going to get your books their own house."
"RORY: I didn't, I swear."
"LORELAI: It's from my mother."
"RORY: What is it?"
"LORELAI: It's heavy. Must be her hopes and dreams for me."
"RORY: I thought she discarded those years ago."
"[they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Just drop the Beanies by the door. [reads note attached to the box] ""Girls, here are some travel books I stumbled across in your father's study. I thought they could help in the planning of your European adventure."" She's insane."
"RORY: We have travel books."
"LORELAI: No, sweetie, these aren't our kind of travel books. These are Paris and Nicky Hilton's kind of travel books."
"RORY: [pulls some books out of the box] ""Selected Hotels of Europe,"" ""Hotels, Restaurants and Inns of Great Britain and Ireland, 1986"", ""Myra Waldo's Travel and Motoring Guide to Europe, '78."""
"LORELAI: Wow, these will be an enormous help in planning our trip. Hey, you wanna go see the Berlin Wall?"
"RORY: Sounds great."
"LORELAI: My God, I remember these books. I think the only person in my house who ever read them was me."
"RORY: This hotel is five hundred dollars a night."
"LORELAI: Five hundred dollars a night twenty years ago."
"RORY: What could a hotel possibly have that would make it five hundred dollars a night?"
"LORELAI: An English menu?"
"FLASHBACK  ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Young Lorelai and Christopher walk through the front door]"
"LORELAI: Christopher, stop it, I'm trying to open the door. Graceful and lovely they enter."
"CHRISTOPHER: Is she home?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Mom, are you home?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Mom, are you home?"
"LORELAI: Shh, she'll hear you."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, she likes me."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's right. Mom, it's me, Lorelai, I'm home! I'm home and I'm taking my sweater off. I'm taking my sweater off and dropping it on the floor. I'm dropping it on the floor and walking away from it. I'm walking away from it and leaving it on the floor, and in two years I'm gonna register Democrat. Looks like no Emily."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where's Sofia?"
"LORELAI: Fired."
"CHRISTOPHER: Already."
"LORELAI: She touched the Baccarat unicorn."
"CHRISTOPHER: My God, is she insane?"
"LORELAI: Apparently so."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so, to recap, there's no Emily and there's no Sofia."
"LORELAI: And there's no supervision whatsoever. What will we do?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Let's celebrate."
"LORELAI: Celebrate what?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No more midterms."
"LORELAI: Hear, hear."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, I say that we drink to it."
"LORELAI: Hear, hear."
"CHRISTOPHER: Scotch, vodka, or gin?"
"LORELAI: Hear, hear."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay."
"LORELAI: And put a cherry in it. It looks like the Gilmores are planning a trip again."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where to this time?"
"LORELAI: Someplace fabulous where they'll stay at a fancy hotel with a lot of other rich Americans so they won't have to talk to anyone who actually lives in that country."
"CHRISTOPHER: ""Myra Waldo's Travel and Motoring Guide to Europe."" Hello Myra."
"LORELAI: Oh God, I hope they go over Christmas. That would be as holly jolly as it gets. Smooth."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, guess what I decided  I'm not gonna go to college."
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm taking a year and I'm going to Europe. I'm gonna backpack, train it, sleep on a bench, see the world."
"LORELAI: And you've told Straub and Francine about your big plans, I'm sure."
"CHRISTOPHER: Ah, it doesn't matter."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm outta here the second that diploma's in my hand."
"LORELAI: Sounds good."
"CHRISTOPHER: You're coming with me."
"LORELAI: Oh, I am?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yup."
"LORELAI: I'm sleeping on a bench? Okay, how does that picture look to you, cause to me it looks like a big no."
"CHRISTOPHER: Fine, you we get a room for, and then I'll just sleep on the bench outside."
"LORELAI: Much better arrangement."
"CHRISTOPHER: So you'll go?"
"LORELAI: Christopher, you're supposed to go to college. I'm supposed to go to college. Then you're supposed to join your dad's firm where you'll get a corner office and big stick to shove up your butt."
"CHRISTOPHER: Change of plans."
"LORELAI: You can't just change the plans. The plans came over on the Mayflower."
"CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Lor. Let's get out of here, let's get away from this place. Let's take Myra and just bolt. Leave a note on the dining room table. ""Dear Richard and Emily, I don't belong here, I'm going somewhere else, I'll call you when I get there. Love, Lorelai.' How does that sound?"
"LORELAI: Well, the word ""whoopee"" comes to mind."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, then, it's a plan."
"LORELAI: It's a plan."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE (PRESENT)"
"[Lorelai and Rory are still looking through the guidebooks]"
"RORY: Hey, I want to sleep amongst thirteenth century tapestries and chocolates made by local artisans."
"LORELAI: Okay, then, it's settled. We're not staying at any place that wasn't built for Napoleon the third's doctor or doesn't have a Chagall in the bathroom."
"RORY: Hear, hear."
"LORELAI: Now we just have to figure out how we're gonna pay for it. Hey, how good's your organ grinding?"

"[Students are gathered in a meeting room]"
"MADELINE: I called last night and I asked her to talk me through the Korean w*r and she said she was busy."
"LOUISE: Oh, she's definitely got a boyfriend."
"MADELINE: I know."
"LOUISE: Well, I for one think it's about time."
"MADELINE: I agree."
"LOUISE: It wasn't healthy, all that non-dating."
"MADELINE: It definitely didn't help that whole skin thing she was going through."
"LOUISE: How come she didn't tell us?"
"MADELINE: I think she just wanted to make sure it was gonna take."
"LOUISE: So, tell us, what's this Jamie like?"
"RORY: You know, I really don't feel like talking about Paris right now. Or ever."
"MADELINE: Oh, come on, you know him, we don't."
"LOUISE: Is he sexy?"
"MADELINE: Does he have a good car?"
"LOUISE: How's the trust fund?"
"MADELINE: How's the profile?"
"LOUISE: Will the prom pictures work?"
"MADELINE: How are his friends?"
"LOUISE: Yes. Is there spin-off potential? [Paris walks in] Whoops."
"MADELINE: Bye."
"PARIS: Okay, everyone, gather around. I have in my hand the 2002 Franklin Yearbook photos. I got copies for everyone, so let's leave the Barney's clearance sale reenactment for another day, shall we? And, please take note of the fact that the idea of posing under the new school banner was a major, major success."
"RORY: Um, Paris."
"PARIS: Yes?"
"RORY: I'm sneezing."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: In the picture. I'm sneezing and my head is turned."
"PARIS: Oh, yeah, I noticed that, but every picture had something wrong with it and I had to pick the one that was the best for the largest number of people."
"RORY: We took ninety pictures."
"PARIS: What's your point?"
"RORY: My point is in ninety tries, there wasn't one other picture that was good for the group and didn't have me looking like I'm in Cirque du Soleil."
"PARIS: Sorry. Life can play some cruel tricks sometimes."
"RORY: Life had a little help from the Gellar camp this time. [cell phone rings] We are not done. [answers phone] Hello?"
"MAUREEN: Rory, hi, listen. I just got the call and  hold on a sec. I'll call him back. I'm back, sorry. Where was I?"
"RORY: Who is this?"
"MAUREEN: Maureen Rollins, Sherry's friend."
"RORY: Oh, yes, uh, right, Maureen, I'm sorry, I -"
"MAUREEN: Don't worry about it. Listen, I know the invitation said that we were all gathering at the c-section next week, but Sherry just went into labor."
"RORY: What?"
"MAUREEN: She screwed up, she's in labor, and she wanted me to call all the girls and beg them to get down to the hospital ASAP."
"RORY: Oh."
"MAUREEN: It's a big screw-up."
"RORY: I guess."
"MAUREEN: Can you come?"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"MAUREEN: You're a child, right?"
"RORY: What?"
"MAUREEN: School?"
"RORY: Huh?"
"MAUREEN: School, you have school?"
"RORY: Uh, yes, I have school, but "
"MAUREEN: Is there anyway you could reschedule school just for today? She completely screwed up, but she's still our Sherry."
"RORY: Well, I'm actually done with school now. I could grab a train and "
"MAUREEN: That would be the best, the absolute best. You are a great kid. She's at Boston Memorial. I will meet you there. Listen, I have Graydon Carter on the other line."
"RORY: Who?"
"MAUREEN: Graydon Carter. I have to go."
"RORY: Okay, bye."

"EMILY: Please make sure the light is very soft. I want a luminous quality."
"PHOTOGRAPHER: I'm gonna have to see the young lady before I can set the final lighting."
"EMILY: Yes, of course. Arletta, did you call Lorelai?"
"ARLETTA: Yes, ma'am. Twenty minutes ago."
"EMILY: And what did she say?"
"ARLETTA: She said she was still getting dressed. Do you want me to go up there again?"
"EMILY: No, I'll do it. I swear, you'd think that it was my coming out portrait, not hers, for the amount of concern she has about all of this. I'll be right back. Don't scratch the floor."
"[Cut to upstairs  Young Lorelai is in her bedroom trying to fit into her debutante gown. There's a knock at the door.]"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, the photographer needs you downstairs."

"LORELAI: No."
"[Emily walks into the bedroom]"
"EMILY: I don't have time for your attitude young lady. This man is being paid by the hour. Why aren't you dressed?"
"LORELAI: I just. . .I think the zipper's too new or stiff or something."
"EMILY: Turn around, I'll do it. [tries to zip up the dress] Oh my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: It's not the zipper, it's the dress. It's too small."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"EMILY: Of course I'm sure. It's too small. How can it be too small? We had a fitting three months ago. Have you gained weight?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Hold your breath."
"LORELAI: I am."
"EMILY: Hold your breath!"
"LORELAI: I am!"
"EMILY: The only thing I can think of is the dressmaker must've written the measurements down wrong. Well, what are we supposed to do now? I certainly can't take a picture of you like that."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"EMILY: I'll just have to have him come back next week. And I'm going to call that woman at the dress shop and give her a piece of my mind. My God, is everyone in the world completely incompetent? Put on your sweats and run around the block. You're gonna fit into the next dress no matter what."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER (PRESENT)"

"KIRK: I don't know."

"RORY: Where's everyone else?"
"MAUREEN: Oh, they're working."
"RORY: What?"
"MAUREEN: Well, we had all planned on next week, but Sherry screwed up, so what can you do? Thank God you're here. She'll be thrilled. She's feeling a little abandoned. Now, she's right in there. Do not mention how fat she is. For some reason, she's extremely sensitive about that today. Okay, kiss. I'll call you later to find out how everything's going."
"RORY: Wait, where are you going?"
"MAUREEN: I've gotta get back to work. I'm swamped today."

"SHERRY: She's at work?"
"RORY: Yes."
"SHERRY: I'm lying in a bed. God knows what's gonna happen."
"RORY: Well, you're going to have a baby."
"SHERRY: And she goes back to work. I would love to go back to work, but I can't because I have to stay here."
"RORY: Well, yeah, because you're going to have a baby."
"SHERRY: She's not here. None of my friends are here. Christopher isn't here. No one is here. No one but you. Thank God you're here, Rory. I don't think that I could do this by myself because this wasn't supposed to happen until next week. I wrote it down. I wrote it down. I wrote it down!"

"EMILY: Well, it's a rare treat to have an evening alone with my daughter uncoerced."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is, isn't it?"
"EMILY: So Rory's at the hospital?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah. She's gonna see her new half-sister fresh from the oven."
"EMILY: Well, that's about an unpleasant a description as I've ever heard. I thought we'd have martinis."
"LORELAI: Very good thought."
"EMILY: Olives?"
"LORELAI: Twist."
"EMILY: So how's Rory feeling about Christopher's new baby?"
"LORELAI: She's very excited. It's kind of cute."
"EMILY: You should've gotten her a puppy."
"LORELAI: Stop. No maid tonight?"
"EMILY: Leloni usually takes Sundays off, but she wanted to switch and seeing as it's just you and I, I said yes."
"LORELAI: Leloni, huh? Very exotic name."
"EMILY: She's from Honolulu."
"LORELAI: Cool. Does she know Don Ho?"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: Charo?"
"EMILY: No."

"EMILY: Leloni made a roast before she left and I heated it up."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"EMILY: I even added a little wine to the pan to keep it from drying out."
"LORELAI: Well, who died and made you Sara Moulton?"
"EMILY: Drink this and be quiet."
"LORELAI: So, um, how long is Dad gone for this time?"
"EMILY: Two weeks."
"LORELAI: Didn't he just come home last week?"
"EMILY: Yes, he did."
"LORELAI: So business must be pretty good?"
"EMILY: I suppose. He has to work twice as hard as he ever did, and I'm still not sure that he's actually made a dime yet. However, he does see to be having the time of his life, so what can you do?"
"LORELAI: Nothing, I guess. Hey Mom, can I ask you something?"
"EMILY: Of course you can."
"LORELAI: What do you do while Dad is gone?"
"EMILY: Well, I do all sorts of things."
"LORELAI: Like what?"
"EMILY: Well, I keep this house running."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"EMILY: And I have my DAR meetings and there's always a thousand calls to make. I have functions and fundraising events to organize. A million different things."
"LORELAI: Okay, but what do you do at night?"
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: I mean, you don't organize functions at night, do you?"
"EMILY: What are you insinuating?"
"LORELAI: I'm not insinuating anything, Mom. I'm just trying to find out a little bit about your life."
"EMILY: Well, your father calls every night at nine o'clock and we talk."
"LORELAI: So, you spend fifteen minutes talking to Dad and then you hang up the phone and you  what? Watch television?"
"EMILY: I don't watch that much television. I don't find forensic work quite as fascinating as the rest of the world."
"LORELAI: But you have cable, right? I mean, you could watch movies."
"EMILY: Yes, but I never know where the maid puts that guide they send you, so I always wind up turning it on after a movie has already started and I don't like to come in on the middle of things."
"LORELAI: But you could tape the movies, or get a DVD player."
"EMILY: I don't need a DVD player."
"LORELAI: Well, why not? Then you could buy all those musicals you love and watch them whenever you felt like it."
"EMILY: I'm not an invalid, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, of course you are, Mother. Why else would I suggest a DVD player?"
"EMILY: I can fill my time all by myself and I'd like you to drop this conversation right now."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"EMILY: We're going to eat. [starts walking toward the kitchen]"

"EMILY: They are in this together."
"STRAUB: I don't see why. Why should Christopher sacrifice everything we've planned for him just because "
"EMILY: Choose your words extremely carefully, Straub."
"FRANCINE: Emily, you know we love Lorelai, you know that. But Christopher's so young, he's a baby."
"EMILY: Well, Lorelai's not exactly collecting social security."
"STRAUB: Why doesn't she get rid of it?"
"EMILY: What?"
"FRANCINE: Straub."
"STRAUB: It's an option."
"EMILY: It certainly is not an option."
"STRAUB: Why not?"
"EMILY: Because I say so."
"STRAUB: Then what the hell are you suggesting, Emily? What's your great solution to this problem?"
"RICHARD: They will get married, they will live here, and Christopher will go to work at my company. That is the solution. Now, we have a plan so we can all stop talking about it. Please excuse me, I have work to do."
"EMILY: I think Richard's plan sounds very sensible."
"STRAUB: I just have one question  why his company?"
"EMILY: What do you mean, his company?"
"STRAUB: Well, I have a law firm. Christopher could go to school."
"[pan to Young Lorelai and Christopher sitting on the staircase]"
"LORELAI: I know we're all upset here folks, but maybe we should ask the kids what they think. Lorelai, Christopher, anything to add here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Quiet, they'll hear you."
"LORELAI: Not likely. I don't know how much longer I can just sit here like this."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay, let them talk."
"LORELAI: They're talking about us."
"CHRISTOPHER: They're trying to figure out what to do."
"LORELAI: What to do with our lives  our lives! Yours and mine and. . .its."
"CHRISTOPHER: We're gonna need their help."
"LORELAI: We can take care of ourselves."
"CHRISTOPHER: How?"
"LORELAI: We'll figure it out."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay. It sounds okay."
"LORELAI: What sounds okay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: You know, working for your dad, living here. It sounds okay."
"LORELAI: Chris, no! What about Europe? What about sleeping on a bench in Paris?"
"CHRISTOPHER: We can't do that now. I have to get a job."
"LORELAI: No!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I have to make money."
"LORELAI: No!"
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay, really."
"EMILY: [in background] You're not even listening to each other."
"STRAUB: [in background] Oh, for God's sake Francine, shut up!"
"CUT TO HOSPITAL ROOM (PRESENT)"
"[Rory is sitting next to Sherry's bed talking on a cell phone]"
"RORY: [on phone] So, we'll see you next Friday at three. And once again, sorry for the short notice. Okay, bye. [hangs up]"
"SHERRY: Great, who's next?"
"RORY: Um, Sheldon Harnick."
"SHERRY: Try and set him for Wednesday."
"RORY: Okay."
"SHERRY: Oh, and don't tell him I'm pregnant. He hates pregnancy."
"RORY: Oh, how about a plumbing problem?"
"SHERRY: Sounds good."
"[A nurse walks into the room]"
"NURSE: Okay, so how are we doing?"
"SHERRY: I'm not sure."
"NURSE: Well, don't be nervous. Everything's going to be just fine. I just wanted to check on you and to see who's going to be with you in the delivery room while it's happening."
"SHERRY: Oh, my fiancé's on his way. He's on his way, right?"
"RORY: Yes, he's on his way."
"SHERRY: Okay, so when he gets here, he'll come in with me."
"NURSE: And if he doesn't get here in time?"
"SHERRY: Then we'll just have to wait."
"NURSE: I'm afraid that's gonna be a little tough to arrange. Once it starts, that's it."
"SHERRY: Okay, well, then I guess it's Rory. Right?"
"RORY: Oh. Absolutely."
"NURSE: Okay, then I'm gonna get you a gown and some gloves so you'll be all set in case you have to go in."
"RORY: That sounds great."
"NURSE: I'll be right back. [leaves]"
"SHERRY: Okay, where were we?"
"RORY: Um, listen, Sherry, I really need a cup of coffee. Would you mind if I ran out really quick?"
"SHERRY: Oh, no, go ahead. I'll make the next few calls myself."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Rory walks into the hallway and calls Lorelai on her cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: Mom, they're giving me gloves!"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"RORY: I don't want gloves, I don't want a gown, I don't wanna be in there."
"LORELAI: In where?"
"RORY: In the delivery room with Sherry."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Dad's not here yet and she's freaking out and she told the nurse I'm going in and "
"LORELAI: Where are her other friends?"
"RORY: They had to work. I'm here all by myself and I'm trying very hard to be calm but I'm starting to feel nauseous, and the hospital has a smell, and there are noises, and those gowns do not stay closed and I've seen a lot of butts today! And -"
"LORELAI: Okay, sweetie, calm down."
"RORY: I need you."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I need you, I need you here, I need you now. I cannot do this alone. I need my Mommy, and dammit, I don't care who knows it!"
"LORELAI: What hospital is it?"
"RORY: Boston Memorial."
"LORELAI: I'll be right there."
"RORY: I really, really like you."
"LORELAI: Tell Sherry to keep her legs crossed til I get there."
"RORY: Does that work?"
"LORELAI: No. Bye. [hangs up] Mom, I gotta go, I'm sorry. Dinner was great."
"EMILY: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: Sherry's freaking out and Rory's the only one with her, so I'm going to the hospital."
"EMILY: You're going to be with Rory's father's girlfriend while she has his baby?"
"LORELAI: Gee, Mom, I can't at all tell what your opinion on that might be."
"EMILY: Why would you do this? This woman pulled Christopher away from you, away from Rory. She destroyed any chance you might have had "
"LORELAI: Rory asked me to come, that's why I'm going."
"EMILY: I don't understand what Rory's doing there either."
"LORELAI: She's going to have a sister."
"EMILY: Half-sister."
"LORELAI: Thank you for a lovely dinner. I'll see you next week."
"FLASHBACK  LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Young Lorelai is watching television and eating a sandwich when she feels a pain in her stomach.]"
"LORELAI: Ow!"
"[cut to hospital  Young Lorelai is sitting in the waiting area filling out a form]"
"NURSE: Are you done?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"NURSE: Okay. Is anyone with you, hon?"
"LORELAI: No."
"NURSE: Well, someone will be up to get you in just a second."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL (PRESENT)"
"[Lorelai steps off the elevator and walks up to the nurse's station]"
"LORELAI: Um, excuse me, Sherry Tinsdale's room please?"
"NURSE: Right through there."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[Rory walks down the hall]"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"LORELAI: You're welcome, and I will be holding this over you for the next ten years. What are you doing?"
"RORY: Xeroxing."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Sherry had some status reports she promised to fax to people by tomorrow but she didn't bring enough, and so I've been trying to find a Xerox machine. I finally conned someone in ICU into letting me use theirs. I haven't found a fax machine yet, but "
"LORELAI: Okay, come on."
"RORY: I have to fax these."
"LORELAI: Uh huh, let's go."
"RORY: But we have a deadline."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm."
"[they walk into Sherry's room]"
"SHERRY: [on phone] Yes, I'm having them faxed over right now. Yes, that's right. Well, I'm not sure if the numbers I have are the numbers that you have. That's right, that's bad. Uh huh. Well, I think you should, too. [to Rory] Did you get those things faxed?"
"LORELAI: Sherry, hang up."
"SHERRY: No, I have to finish this call."
"LORELAI: Just say goodbye."
"SHERRY: But "
"LORELAI: You'll call them back."
"SHERRY: I "
"[Lorelai takes the phone from her]"
"LORELAI: Hi. Uh, Sherry's gonna have to call you back. Yeah, I promise. Okay, goodbye. [hangs up]"
"SHERRY: No, that was work."
"LORELAI: Sherry, you really shouldn't be working right now."
"SHERRY: I can't just stop everything because I'm. . ."
"LORELAI: Having a baby. Admitting it is the first step, honey."
"SHERRY: I'm not ready. I had it planned. Christopher was supposed to be here."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SHERRY: I don't know what to do."
"LORELAI: Well, the first thing you have to do is calm down and stop working."
"SHERRY: Okay."
"LORELAI: And the second thing is, you need to tell me why you're sitting like that."
"SHERRY: Maureen told me that Howard Stern said that if you squat, it makes the baby come out faster."
"LORELAI: Okay, as long as you have a sane reason from a reliable source."
"SHERRY: I'm scared."
"LORELAI: I know. It's scary, and it hurts like hell. And remember, when it comes out not to look at it too hard until they give it a good cleaning, or you'll think you gave birth to phlegm. But, um, once they give it a good scrub, it's just unbelievably cool."
"SHERRY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Well, and look how good they grow up. Not bad, huh?"
"SHERRY: I hope I get that lucky."
"LORELAI: I've got a good feeling."
"SHERRY: Thank you. Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"SHERRY: My ankles are starting to hurt."
"LORELAI: Okay, grab an arm."
"SHERRY: I'm glad you're here."
"LORELAI: Well, at this moment, you probably should be."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL HALLWAY"
"[Rory gets some coffee from the machine as Lorelai walks over to her]"
"LORELAI: She's jogging in place."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: I think she's hoping to aerobicize the thing right out of there."
"RORY: Well, should we stop her?"
"LORELAI: I tried. She almost took an eye out."
"RORY: Well, that can't be good for the baby."
"LORELAI: Well, it's probably no worse than the guilt trip it's gonna get for showing up a week early."
"RORY: You do know it's a girl."
"LORELAI: Yes, I should probably stop calling it ""it"". Her ""it""."
"RORY: I was just bringing you some coffee."
"LORELAI: Thanks. Did you try calling your dad again?"
"RORY: His cell's not in service or out of range or something."
"LORELAI: You do know if he doesn't get here, I have to go in with her."
"RORY: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't want to go in with her."
"RORY: At least you know what's gonna happen."
"LORELAI: I had the cheap seat before. My view was quite a bit different."
"RORY: Hey, should we buy a camera or something?"
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RORY: If Dad doesn't get here, shouldn't we maybe "
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: But "
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: I just thought it would be nice."
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor, Rory!"
"LORELAI: Oh, thank God you're here, Chris."
"CHRISTOPHER: Has it happened? Did I miss it?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: You have perfect timing."
"CHRISTOPHER: I must've broken fifteen different laws getting here. I don't even remember where I left my car. I thought I wasn't gonna make it."
"LORELAI: Well, take a breath, you did make it, and Sherry's gonna be thrilled."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where is she?"
"LORELAI: Come on."
"CHRISTOPHER: Is this. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"[they walk into Sherry's room, where she's being transferred to a gurney]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sherry!"
"SHERRY: Christopher, you're here! I can't believe you're here. I didn't think you'd make it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Are you kidding? You think I'd miss this."
"SHERRY: No, I'm sorry. It's just, I'm just in a lot of pain and I can't think straight."
"NURSE: I take it this is your fiancé."
"SHERRY: Yeah, this is him. This is my Christopher."
"NURSE: Well, Christopher, are you coming in with us?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Try and stop me."
"NURSE: Okay, let's go then."
"[they start wheeling her out of the room]"
"RORY: We'll be right here, waiting."
"LORELAI: Have fun."
"RORY: Have fun?"
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"FLASHBACK  HOSPITAL"
"[A nurse is wheeling Young Lorelai down the hall on a gurney]"
"LORELAI: Okay, this is a big pain and I'd really like it to go away, please."
"NURSE: Just breathe deep, honey."
"LORELAI: Breathing doesn't help, can I hit you instead?"
"NURSE: What?"
"LORELAI: Or pinch you really hard, cause that might make me feel better."
"NURSE: No, you cannot hit me."
"LORELAI: Can I bite you or pull your hair or use the Epilady on you cause I really need to do something."
"EMILY: Lorelai Gilmore!"
"LORELAI: Wheel this a little faster, please."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you do not do this. You do not just leave a person a note."
"LORELAI: Okay, see the timing here?"
"EMILY: ""Dear Mom and Dad, I'm in labor. See you later, Lorelai."""
"LORELAI: Ow."
"RICHARD: Emily, please, I feel ridiculous."
"EMILY: You're having a baby  do you know that, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Well, that explains the stomachache."
"EMILY: You do not leave your house when you are having a baby without telling your mother. You say, ""Excuse me, Mom. I'm having a baby, give me a ride to the damn hospital!"""
"RICHARD: Emily, please, I wore the wrong shoes for this."
"EMILY: Of all the things in the world I had a right to do, driving my daughter to the hospital to give birth, especially since she's sixteen years old and doesn't have her driver's license yet, is definitely one of them."
"NURSE: Ma'am, I need to wait out here, please."
"EMILY: Why?"
"NURSE: Because we're going into the delivery room."
"EMILY: I want to go in."
"LORELAI: No, Mom, please."
"RICHARD: Yes, Emily, please."
"EMILY: Fine, we'll be right here when you're done."
"LORELAI: Super."
"EMILY: And do not think we're finished discussing this, young lady, because we are not!"
"RICHARD: Emily, let's just sit here."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL (PRESENT)"
"RORY: I'm glad he got here."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Me, too."
"RORY: So I guess now we wait?"
"LORELAI: Yup, now we wait."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"JESS: Kirk, how long are you gonna sit here?"
"KIRK: What do you mean?"
"JESS: It's been four hours. Go home."
"KIRK: It's boring at home. My TV's broken."
"JESS: So do something else."
"KIRK: Like what?"
"JESS: Read a book."
"KIRK: What book?"
"JESS: Any book."
"KIRK: I'm gonna need a suggestion."
"JESS: Moby Dick."
"KIRK: That's about the whale?"
"JESS: Yes."
"KIRK: No. What else?"
"JESS: Forget it, just sit there."
"KIRK: Okay."
"[Luke and Nicole walk in]"
"LUKE: So he just drove all the way to New York, picked up the cheese, drove back. Nobody talked about it ever again."
"NICOLE: Oh, God, I love cheese."
"LUKE: Well, you would've gotten along very well with my father. So, you want some coffee?"
"NICOLE: I would love some coffee."
"LUKE: Have a seat. Jess, coffee over here."
"NICOLE: So, I have to say, I really hated that restaurant."
"LUKE: Good, I like that we're on the same page here."
"NICOLE: I did, however, have a really good time."
"LUKE: Once again, I like that we're on the same page here."
"JESS: Okay, coffee."
"NICOLE: Thank you."
"JESS: Did you have a good time?"
"NICOLE: Yeah, we had a really good time."
"JESS: Okay, well, I'm going to go out for about an hour."
"LUKE: What are you talking about? It's 11:30."
"JESS: I know. I'm just gonna go out for about an hour."
"LUKE: Where?"
"JESS: Out."
"LUKE: Out where?"
"JESS: Out for about an hour."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"JESS: I'm talking about going out for about an hour. What  you need more time?"
"LUKE: Nicole, will you excuse me for a minute?"
"NICOLE: Sure."
"LUKE: Okay."
"[Luke and Jess walk outside; they argue in front of the window]"
"KIRK: They have amazing communication."
"[Luke and Jess walk back inside]"
"JESS: I guess I'm not going out for about an hour."
"LUKE: Say goodnight, Jess."
"JESS: I don't understand you, man."
"LUKE: My mystique is part of my charm."
"JESS: You at least want me to take a walk around the block?"
"LUKE: Jess."
"JESS: Take an extra long shower?"
"LUKE: Go upstairs."
"JESS: Sorry, I tried."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL"
"[Lorelai is reading in the waiting room, Rory is asleep next to her. Christopher walks over to them]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor?"
"LORELAI: Are you a daddy?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Come on, come look. We'll wake Rory later."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[they walk down the hall]"
"LORELAI: So how was it?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, man, Lor, in my wildest dreams, I never could've imagined. I've never been that nervous or terrified or nauseous in my entire life. It was like the most amazing thing ever in the world. It was like. . .well, you know."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do know."
"CHRISTOPHER: I've never seen anything like it."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"CHRISTOPHER: And Sherry was great. I'm flying, I mean it, I'm flying."
"[they stand in front of the nursery window]"
"CHRISTOPHER: There."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"CHRISTOPHER: That's my daughter."
"LORELAI: I can tell."
"CHRISTOPHER: How?"
"LORELAI: I think she conned that one out of his blanket."
"CHRISTOPHER: She's perfect."
"LORELAI: Rory was perfect. She, however, is a good solid second."
"CHRISTOPHER: I just can't believe it."
"LORELAI: She's beautiful, really. Congratulations Christopher."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. Thank you for everything."
"LORELAI: Of course."
"FLASHBACK  HOSPITAL"
"[Young Lorelai and Christopher are looking through the nursery window at baby Rory]"
"CHRISTOPHER: She's pretty."
"LORELAI: She's perfect."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, I guess we should get married."
"CUT TO HOSPITAL  (PRESENT)"
"[Lorelai and Christopher are still looking at the baby through the window]"

"LORELAI: Yeah, she'd like to see this."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE (PRESENT)"
"[Emily is going through the mail when the doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: I'll get it, Leloni. You find out where that smell is coming from. [answers door] Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom."
"EMILY: What on Earth are you doing here? What is this?"
"LORELAI: This is your new DVD player."
"EMILY: My what?"
"LORELAI: Plus, I picked up Singin' in the Rain, Funny Girl, Easter Parade, An American in Paris, and as an added bonus, the new classic dance series  Urban Cowboy, Saturday Night Fever, Grease, Footloose, and Flashdance. Trust me, you're gonna be cutting up your sweatshirts all weekend."
"EMILY: Why did you do this?"
"LORELAI: Cause I thought you'd enjoy it."
"EMILY: But I don't know anything about a DVD player."
"LORELAI: Mom, trust me, once it's hooked up, all you'll have to know is how to press play."
"EMILY: But who's gonna hook it up?"
"LORELAI: I am."
"EMILY: You know how to hook this up?"
"LORELAI: I know how to read an instruction manual."
"EMILY: Since when?"
"LORELAI: Hm, please."
"EMILY: Maybe we should get a professional."
"LORELAI: I can do this. Just give me five seconds here."
"EMILY: Well? Well, can you do it? Oh, just forget it."
"LORELAI: Mom, please, just let me focus on this for one more second, and if I cannot do it, I'll get a professional DVD guy in here to install it, okay?"
"EMILY: I still don't understand why you got me this. [looks at the DVDs] I love this movie."
"FLASHBACK  ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily and Richard walk down the stairs]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, we're leaving! Well, what do you know? She finally put Rory's stroller away. It's the first time in a year I haven't tripped over that thing."
"RICHARD: Where's my scarf?"
"EMILY: I told Tina to put everything out for you, Richard."
"RICHARD: Out where?"
"EMILY: Look on the table."
"RICHARD: You have to be more specific with her, Emily."
"EMILY: Fine, Richard."
"RICHARD: There should be a designated place to put things."
"EMILY: Whatever you say, Richard. Lorelai, we are leaving! Please acknowledge that! Where is that girl?"
"RICHARD: This is not the scarf I asked for."
"EMILY: Well, it looks fine. Can you just wear it?"
"RICHARD: No, I'm gonna go back upstairs and get the scarf I intended to wear in the first place. Well, I'm surprised at you Emily. These are your friends we're seeing tonight. You would have thought that my appearance would be a priority for you. I didn't want to go to this thing in the first place. I have an early meeting in the morning, and I would much rather go to bed and ignore the fact that the symphony has to reupholster its mezzanine this year."
"[Emily reads a note on the table and starts to cry]"
"RICHARD: Emily? Emily?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE (PRESENT)"
"[Emily waits while Lorelai reads through the DVD player's instruction manual]"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: Well, can you do it?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea."
"EMILY: Where are you going? Are you going to take it back?"
"LORELAI: I'm going upstairs."
"EMILY: Why?"
"LORELAI: I think I should put this in your bedroom. That's your best TV."
"EMILY: You just said you didn't know how to hook that up."
"LORELAI: I'll figure it out."
"EMILY: But there are wires involved and connections and electricity. You could hurt yourself or set the house on fire."
"LORELAI: [sings] In your Easter bonnet. . ."
"EMILY: You could ruin our television set."
"LORELAI: . . .with all the frills upon it, you'll be the grandest fella in the Easter parade. Hoo! I'll be all in clover. . ."
"EMILY: I don't like being ignored, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: . . .and when they look us over, we'll be the proudest people in the Easter parade."

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are eating dinner]"
"EMILY: And then she just brushed me off with a wave of her regal hand. Not even a word, just a. . .like I'm her cabana boy. Next thing you know, instead of just walking out of the room, she'll make me bow and back out. Imperious attitude, she never gives it a rest. I schlepped her to the doctor the other day  by command, not request  and the elevator operator there greeted us nice and friendly. Her doctor's on the second floor and by the time we got there, that operator was in tears."
"LORELAI: Whew."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: Well, Mom, you just did twenty straight minutes on Gran."
"EMILY: It wasn't twenty minutes."
"RORY: It was getting there."
"LORELAI: How about a moratorium on the Gran stories for a bit?"
"EMILY: Fine. I'd rather not spoil the meal with talk of her."
"LORELAI: Good."
"EMILY: I should just wash my hands."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: We'll wait."
"EMILY: I mean of her."
"LORELAI: Oh, good, wash those hands."
"EMILY: She sucks her olive pits."
"LORELAI: Short moratorium."
"EMILY: Trying to extract every last ounce of flavor out of them like she does people."
"LORELAI: She sucks flavor out of people?"
"RORY: Can we change the subject?"
"EMILY: Life, not flavor."
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what Gran needs?"
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: A fella."
"RORY: With or without an umbrella."
"EMILY: He'd have to look like an olive pit to get her attention."
"LORELAI: It's like a Dean Martin Roast."
"RORY: Those are never funny to me."
"LORELAI: Yeah, they're mean."
"RORY: Except for Don Rickles."
"LORELAI: Totally except for Rickles."
"EMILY: I think she did have a man for a time squiring her around to her biddy affairs. Richard thought so, too, and it horrified him."
"LORELAI: Didn't want a new Daddy, huh?"
"EMILY: And then he seemed suddenly out of the picture."
"RORY: So Great Grandma never talked about him?"
"EMILY: Never. Even though I could tell practically the day she stopped seeing him. Those kinds of things are always obvious."
"RORY: Yeah, I guess."
"EMILY: When a couple is in a relationship and then suddenly isn't."
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: Is she still looking?"
"LORELAI: Yup."
"RORY: Right. Um, you know, Grandma, did I mention that unfortunately I'm not with Dean anymore?"
"EMILY: No, you didn't."
"RORY: Well, I'm not."
"EMILY: Well, yes, I've known for weeks actually. But it's good that you confirmed it."
"RORY: How did you know?"
"EMILY: Well, you very abruptly stopped mentioning him eleven dinners ago, so I figured that was the case."
"LORELAI: Eleven dinners, you kept count?"
"EMILY: Eleven."
"LORELAI: Eleven."
"RORY: Well, I'm sorry I didn't tell you Grandma."
"EMILY: Well, I think you should have. I mean, what if I had invited Dean to an event and you were no longer with him, and that's how I found out? It would've been embarrassing."
"LORELAI: What sort of event would you have invited Dean to?"
"EMILY: I don't know, a wedding."
"LORELAI: For who?"
"EMILY: A mutual friend or something."
"LORELAI: You and Dean have mutual friends in common that Rory and I don't? Who would that be, the Talbotts or that senior partner at Deloite and Touche?"
"EMILY: You know what I meant. It's always best to tell each other major life events so that there's no awkwardness."
"RORY: Well, then, Grandma, I probably also failed to mention that I'm seeing someone else."
"EMILY: Who?"
"RORY: Jess."
"EMILY: Jess?"
"LORELAI: Luke's nephew. Luke from the diner."
"EMILY: Oh, I see. Well, am I going to get to meet him soon?"
"RORY: Oh, I don't know."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange."
"EMILY: Well, how hard can it be? Just bring him over for dinner sometime. How about next Friday?"
"RORY: Oh, I don't know."
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah, Mom, that might be hard to arrange."
"EMILY: It's perfect timing. Richard will still be out of town and it would be nice to round off the group with a fourth."
"LORELAI: He works Fridays, doesn't he?"
"RORY: Yeah, that's his usual night. Friday night. It's a bad night."
"EMILY: Oh, okay. Well, I suppose I'll eventually meet him someday at some function."
"LORELAI: Perhaps a wedding."
"EMILY: Or Rory's graduation. That's good. That way we'll all get to meet him at once. Myself, Richard, Gran. Maybe I'll bring a couple of girls from the DAR. Reverend Mahoney might like to come also."
"RORY: You know what, Grandma, now that I think about it, I think Jess does have next Friday night off."
"EMILY: Really?"
"RORY: Let's make it a foursome."
"EMILY: That'll be nice."
"RORY: Yeah, it will be nice, right Grandma?"
"EMILY: Very nice. We'll have lamb."
"RORY: So, it will be nice for everybody? Everybody will be nice to everybody? The key word being nice."
"EMILY: Yes, very nice."
"RORY: Really, really nice?"
"EMILY: Of course it'll be nice. That's what I just said."
"RORY: Good. Nice would be nice."
"EMILY: And a nice night it'll be."
"LORELAI: Well, not so nice for the lamb."

"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at the kitchen table]"
"LORELAI: Okay, Saturday morning I've got hair appointment, nails, and Jim."
"RORY: You don't go to the gym."
"LORELAI: No, Jim is coming here to fix the garbage disposal."
"RORY: Jim Dunning, got it."
"LORELAI: I also have resha plebisham."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, I can't read it."
"RORY: Shouldn't you change your system, go electronic or something? You're a busy woman."
"LORELAI: Uh, hey, my system works."
"RORY: Yeah, tell that to the guy who calls tomorrow because you missed your resha plebisham appointment."
"LORELAI: I hate that we have to coordinate schedules. You're my daughter."
"RORY: But if we don't, we may never see each other."
"LORELAI: We didn't use to have to do this."
"RORY: Well, we're busier now."
"LORELAI: Let's just run away together and leave all this behind."
"RORY: You mean our house?"
"LORELAI: No, we'll take the house, we'll leave everything else."
"RORY: Put it on your list."
"LORELAI: So what's your day like tomorrow?"
"RORY: Hanging out with Jess for most of the day, studying at night."
"LORELAI: Cool. Alex and I are having dinner tomorrow night."
"RORY: Good. That'll make it nice and quiet for when I study."
"LORELAI: I'm that loud?"
"RORY: You are when you dance around singing Rory's Studying' songs."
"LORELAI: Oh, what's this I have down for Sunday  slatha bang trafficking?"
"RORY: Lane's band practicing."
"LORELAI: And underneath it  net fracks?"
"RORY: Get snacks."
"LORELAI: Right  for the band. See, see, it works. So, uh, you're actually bringing Jess to dinner on Friday?"
"RORY: It's as good a time as any. There'll only be one grandparent to contend with."
"LORELAI: Man, that was some stealthy little maneuver she pulled there, huh? Applying the guilt over not knowing about the Dean breakup and making you all weak, and then using that to get Jess to come to dinner on Friday. She's like Lyndon Johnson with the Senate, effortless."
"RORY: So, Sunday's for us, right?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have you down right here  Cokie."
"RORY: Good. Hey, it's still early. Do you wanna watch more of the extra supplementary stuff on the Lord of the Rings DVD?"
"LORELAI: Well, it's just the drawings and that fat guy talking."
"RORY: Well, let's watch Footloose again."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Hey, you dropped some of your notes."
"LORELAI: Oh, who cares? You can't read them anyway."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Rory and Jess are sitting on a bench looking at a book]"
"RORY: Do you love it?"
"JESS: It's great."
"RORY: The Holy Barbarians. I mean, what a title. And it's by a Venice Beach b*at about Venice Beach b*at, and to top it off, the b*at who wrote it is the father of the guy that does those Actor's Studio interviews on TV."
"JESS: The guy with the beard?"
"RORY: Yeah, the pointy beard. That's his dad writing at his desk."
"JESS: Oh, it's weird that a weird b*at guy would have a conservative son like that."
"RORY: Maybe he's not that conservative. Maybe at night, he, like, takes off his clothes and parties."
"JESS: Aw, man, now get that picture out of my head."
"RORY: It's a cool book, you've gotta admit."
"JESS: It is. Thanks."
"RORY: Oh, I'm not lending it. I'm not done."
"JESS: Well, why'd you show it to me?"
"RORY: I like showing you the stuff I'm reading."
"JESS: But you knew I'd wanna read it. You're a book tease."
"RORY: You'll get it when I'm done."
"JESS: Cruel woman."
"RORY: So, are you going to work now?"
"JESS: Back to the salt mines."
"RORY: So, you're not tied to the hours you have, right? You can trade if you want to."
"JESS: There's some flexibility."
"RORY: You got any flexibility next Friday night?"
"JESS: Yeah, why?"
"RORY: I thought maybe you could come to dinner with us."
"JESS: Us?"
"RORY: To my Grandma's."
"JESS: To meet your grandmother."
"RORY: Yeah, she'll be there, so yeah, it might be rude not to introduce the two of you."
"JESS: I can't, I gotta work."
"RORY: You just said you could get out."
"JESS: I didn't know what for."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: No."
"RORY: But I already kind of agreed."
"JESS: Aw, man."
"RORY: So I'm kinda jammed here."
"JESS: Does she know what I look like?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"JESS: Perfect. Find someone who vaguely resembles me. Take him. Just don't kiss him goodnight."
"RORY: That's not going to work."
"JESS: Andy Warhol did it all the time. [Rory gives him the book] We're just five bucks away from a deal."
"RORY: [kisses him] That's worth five at least."
"JESS: You Gilmores think a lot of yourselves. Okay."
"RORY: Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"JESS: Manipulator."
"[They both walk away in opposite directions. Rory walks past the dance studio as Miss Patty walks out]"
"MISS PATTY: Rory, get in here."
"RORY: What?"
"MISS PATTY: Get in here now. No questions."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they walk into the dance studio. Rory sits down next to Dean.]"
"MISS PATTY: Okay, now, for those who just arrived, I'm trying out some material for my one-woman show and I need some feedback. You are my randomly picked audience."
"DEAN: Randomly shang-hai'ed."
"MISS PATTY: It's part stories, part songs. Kind of like what Elaine Stritch did on Broadway, but without the bitterness. My working title  ""Buckle Up, I'm Patty."""
"RORY: How long have you been here?"
"DEAN: An hour."
"RORY: Poor thing."
"DEAN: It's been mostly her and Kirk arguing about stuff. Apparently, he's the director."
"KIRK: Patty, let's try one of your reminisces."
"MISS PATTY: That's what I'm looking for, Kirk."
"DEAN: Sorry I didn't save you. I didn't see you until it was too late."
"RORY: I don't think anybody could've saved me."
"MISS PATTY: Okay, here we go. Hey, did you know that I once met the great Bette Davis? I was a chorus girl in a bus-and-truck tour of ""Guys and Dolls."" Beantown, I love that town. And there I was, me and the girls backstage after the show, and in she comes. And who does she walk right up to, but little old me. And she sized me up, exhaled some smoke from that regal mouth of hers, and said, ""Doll, you don't got the high notes but you sure got the gams."" I'll always treasure that moment with Bette and I wanna dedicate this song to her. Uh, Ethel, key a D."
"KIRK: We're gonna have to rewrite that."
"MISS PATTY: What?"
"KIRK: It got no response. It needs a rewrite."
"MISS PATTY: Kirk, it's my reminiscence. I can't rewrite it."
"KIRK: How about if she says, ""Doll, you've got the gams, but I've got a body in the trunk of my car."""
"MISS PATTY: Why would she say that?"
"KIRK: Because she's a m*rder. I think it works."
"MISS PATTY: I'm not rewriting my memories, Kirk."
"KIRK: It died. Build a coffin for it, put some pennies on its eyes cause that stiff ain't breathing."
"MISS PATTY: Well, I think that we should discuss this later, now go back to your light booth."
"KIRK: Fine, start the song."
"MISS PATTY: [sings] It's a quarter of three, there is no one in the place, except you and me. [strobe light starts flashing] Kirk, would you fix this?"
"KIRK: Fix what?"
"MISS PATTY: This flashing."
"KIRK: That's my choice for the song."
"MISS PATTY: It's disco."
"KIRK: I'm trying to subvert expectations."
"MISS PATTY: Well, don't. Just give me a simple spot."
"KIRK: Something more obvious, got it."
"RORY: This is a hit."
"DEAN: It'll run for years."
"KIRK: Something on the nose and expected, got it."
"MISS PATTY: Kirk!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Later that night, Rory and Dean walk out of the dance studio]"
"RORY: It was nice of you to step in like that."
"DEAN: Well, she could've hurt herself trying to throw the podium at him like that."
"RORY: I think ""work in progress"" is the key phrase."
"DEAN: I like that she tries."
"RORY: The woman taught me everything I've already forgotten about dancing, baton twirling and gymnastics."
"DEAN: Well, I'm this way."
"RORY: I'm this way."
"DEAN: See you later."
"RORY: See ya."
"DEAN: You know, I kind of liked the body in the trunk thing."
"RORY: Me, too. Peppier."
"DEAN: Night."
"RORY: Night."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is studying on the couch when she hears a noise outside. She walks to the door and opens it. Lorelai and Alex are kissing on the front porch]"
"RORY: Oh, sorry."
"LORELAI: It's okay."
"ALEX: It's okay."
"RORY: I can just shut the door so you can carry on."
"ALEX: No, we've carried on enough."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I think we've carried on pretty good out here. I'll call you about the weekend."
"ALEX: Okay."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"ALEX: Bye. Bye Rory."
"RORY: Goodnight."
"[Alex leaves. Lorelai walks into the house]"
"RORY: We need a signal."
"LORELAI: A kissing signal?"
"RORY: Something to avoid this."
"LORELAI: Okay, um, how bout I sh**t off a flare when I'm outside necking with a boy?"
"RORY: You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: Or I could bang on the door and yell, ""Hey, we're necking out here!"""
"RORY: I still say we need a signal."
"LORELAI: We'll think of something. Hey, listen. Alex and I were talking about going to New York next weekend."
"RORY: Fun."
"LORELAI: Yeah. He's got four tickets to a show and he's heard me talk about Sookie and Jackson so much that he wants to invite them, too."
"RORY: It's not ""Buckle Up, I'm Patty,"" is it?"
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"RORY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: We'd have to leave Friday day."
"RORY: So?"
"LORELAI: Meaning it's just you and Jess alone at dinner with the glorious Emily."
"RORY: Oh, that's totally fine."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"RORY: Yeah, it might even make things easier."
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: Nothing. Just, it might make it less pressure-packed."
"LORELAI: So I'm loud when you study and make social gatherings worse?"
"RORY: Out of the goodness of your heart, you would be trying to shield me all night, and that might makes things worse. Out of love. And I love you, I hope you know that."
"[phone rings]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I think I get it. I have the best intentions."
"RORY: Bingo. [answers phone] Hello?"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey. How was work?"
"JESS: I toted the barge, lifted the bale."
"RORY: Well, you're a great barge toter, I can attest to that."
"JESS: How was your day?"
"RORY: Fine. A lot of studying."
"JESS: Oh yeah? Is that all you did?"
"RORY: Yeah, basically."
"JESS: Basically?"
"RORY: Jess, what?"
"JESS: I heard that you were basically hanging out with Dean today."
"RORY: Where did you hear that?"
"JESS: It's all over town."
"RORY: Well, I was with him for awhile. What do you mean, it's all over town?"
"JESS: You haven't seen the fliers?"
"RORY: I've been home all night. What fliers?"
"JESS: It says, ""People are already raving about Miss Patty's one woman show."""
"RORY: And?"
"JESS: There's some blurbs. One says, ""Rory and Dean couldn't stop talking about it."""
"RORY: We're on a flier?"
"JESS: You and a bunch of others. ""The mailman says, even without proper postage, this show delivers."""
"RORY: Well, now she's making that up cause Ralph's not that witty."
"JESS: Were you hanging out there with Dean?"
"RORY: I was not hanging out with Dean. We were both hauled in there to watch her try out material and we were sitting in the same area so we talked a little, and then we left at the same time. That was it. It was all by accident."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: This is an old subject, Jess. You know that Dean and I are friendly."
"JESS: I know you're friendly. That doesn't mean I don't wanna punch him."
"RORY: This was not a plan. I was kidnapped by Miss Patty, so was he, that's it."
"JESS: Then you two should press charges."
"RORY: I think we should."
"JESS: Just "
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: Just tell me these things first so I don't have to read about them on telephone poles."
"RORY: I will, I promise."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: Okay."
"JESS: So, how was the show?"
"RORY: It's gonna need a lot of postage."
"JESS: Why does it say, ""Not in any way affiliated with Kirk"" down at the bottom?"
"RORY: Oh, they had a showbiz spat."
"JESS: Fill me in."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai gets out snacks for the band, who are sitting at the table]"
"LORELAI: Help yourselves to drinks in the fridge, guys. We've got chips, pretzels, and Brian, I remembered your allergies and got you the melba toast."
"BRIAN: That's nice, thanks."
"DAVE: We got a lot done today."
"LANE: We've almost got a full set."
"ZACH: But you know what we're missing? A straight-ahead love song."
"BRIAN: Yeah, all our songs are pretty much about property destruction and a general dislike of right-wing causes."
"LORELAI: Not one love song, huh?"
"DAVE: I think we can add one or two, that are good ones."
"LORELAI: Boy, you'd think love songs are all you and Lane would wanna play."
"ZACH: Man, this crunch just now sounded like the drum-fill in Baba O'Reilly."
"LANE: Cool, way to go Zach."
"DAVE: Yeah, Zach, a musical mouth. That's awesome."
"ZACH: But why would Dave and Lane wanna play just love songs?"
"LORELAI: Because, I was just thinking, you know, with Dave's name  Dave  you've got the last two letters in love. V, E. And with Lane's name, you have the L. You can just dump the A and add an O and there you go."
"ZACH: Makes sense."
"BRIAN: Totally. We should probably start breaking stuff down. I gotta get home for dinner."
"ZACH: One day soon, you're not gonna go home from dinner."
"BRIAN: What, I'll be dead?"
"ZACH: No, we'll be on tour."
"BRIAN: Right, right."
"ZACH: That was a negative ""right, right,"" man."
"[Zach and Brian go outside]"
"LORELAI: Guys, I'm so sorry. It just slipped out."
"LANE: That's okay."
"DAVE: Luckily Zach and Brian are. . .well, Zach and Brian."
"LORELAI: How long are you gonna keep it a secret?"
"LANE: For awhile, at least. It's easier."
"LORELAI: Are you sure it would be so bad if they knew? I mean, keeping this a secret seems awfully complicated."
"LANE: Not really, we've got a system."
"DAVE: Um, speaking of which, it's 3:18. We'll have the stuff packed by 3:40, what's the situation?"
"LANE: At 3:40, my mom will be on her way to the yarn store for her bimonthly sew-a-thon with Lacey Schwartz and Bick Ho."
"DAVE: The yarn store's on Peach."
"LANE: Plum."
"DAVE: That cuts us off from our usually route to the interstate."
"LANE: There's a back road that circles around it, but it's gonna be muddy from the rains."
"DAVE: How about I have the guys take the usual route, I'll go by foot on Peach, down the alley behind Al's, over the fence, and they can pick me up a half a mile down by the Shell station."
"LANE: Perfect. Uh, what, that's not complicated."
"LORELAI: Sorry I doubted you."
"LANE: Well, okay, then."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey. Coffee?"
"LORELAI: Please, and hurry. I am going to Manhattan this weekend and I need to shop for some warm clothes."
"LUKE: You already have warm clothes."
"LORELAI: I have nothing."
"LUKE: We're in Connecticut. It gets freezing here same as in New York."
"LORELAI: No, it's not the same."
"LUKE: Exactly the same."
"LORELAI: Well, I have nothing stylish enough."
"LUKE: That's not true, you got the black cashmere coat."
"LORELAI: But it needs cleaning."
"LUKE: So clean it."
"LORELAI: But I need some sweaters, too."
"LUKE: You've got the purple, you've got the powder blue, you've got three shades of red, you've got a ton of black, all of which will go with that coat. Plus, you've got a dozen scarves to mix and match with any of those tops."
"LORELAI: Let me shop for some clothes."
"LUKE: Okay. So what are you doing in New York?"
"LORELAI: Oh, a bunch of us are going. It'll be dinner and a show."
"LUKE: Oh, what show?"
"LORELAI: Levittown, it's a new musical."
"LUKE: Right, yeah. It's in previews, doesn't officially open for a couple weeks."
"LORELAI: Wow, so informed."
"LUKE: Nicole likes the theater. Her firm has an office on Madison. I've met her there a couple times. Saw Hairspray last week."
"LORELAI: I cannot picture you watching Hairspray."
"LUKE: It was okay. I liked The Producers better."
"LORELAI: Well, aren't we just a Broadway baby."
"LUKE: Gonna have any time to k*ll there?"
"LORELAI: Some."
"LUKE: Got a great book, it has walking tours of old historic Manhattan. You know, before Disney got a hold of it. The Soho one's pretty good."
"LORELAI: Oh, I love stuff like that."
"LUKE: It's upstairs on my dresser if you wanna run up and grab it."
"LORELAI: Cool, thanks."
"[Cut to upstairs. Lorelai walks into Luke's apartment and finds Rory and Jess kissing on the couch]"
"LORELAI: Oh, oh!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Surprise."
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: I came up for a book."
"JESS: A book?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"JESS: Got a lot of books here. Anything in particular?"
"LORELAI: It's one of Luke's."
"JESS: Well, if it doesn't have Encyclopedia Brown in the title, that narrows it down a lot."
"LORELAI: Walking tours, New York."
"JESS: On the table. [hands her the book]"
"LORELAI: Good, here it is, okay, so, thanks. Sorry about this."
"RORY: It's okay."
"LORELAI: We should probably come up with a system or something."
"RORY: Probably."
"LORELAI: Déjà vu, huh?"
"RORY: Déjà vu."
"LORELAI: Although, why I'd be walking into Luke's apartment like this in the future, I don't know, so put the system on the back burner."
"JESS: Okay."
"LORELAI: Mmkay. Carry on, or. . .see ya."
"[Lorelai walks back down to the diner]"
"LORELAI: Dude!"
"LUKE: Hey. Find it okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I found everything -- including a couple coupling."
"LUKE: Oh, Rory and Jess?"
"LORELAI: No, Ben and J. Lo. Yes, Rory and Jess."
"LUKE: I guess I should've told you."
"LORELAI: You knew they were up there?"
"LUKE: They're up there all the time."
"LORELAI: On the couch. . .horizontal, on the couch?"
"LUKE: They come up for air every so often."
"LORELAI: And you just allow this? Luke!"
"LUKE: Settle down. I go up there every ten minutes pretending to get something to keep them from doing something we don't want. ""Oops, I forgot my pocketknife."" ""Oops, uh, I'm out of ones."" ""Uh, hey, you see a case of mustard up here?"" I put the stuff in a box. I take the box upstairs every couple days and start all over again."
"LORELAI: And you think that suffices?"
"LUKE: Look, it's better that they're safe and upstairs than someplace else. And you going up there just now saved me a trip, so thanks."
"LORELAI: Glad to be of service."
"LUKE: I got a good system, it works."
"LORELAI: Every ten minutes?"
"LUKE: Like clockwork, never a minute more."
"LORELAI: Even if you're serving a customer, it's every ten minutes?"
"LUKE: If I'm in mid-pour, I stop and go up."
"LORELAI: Ten minutes. Yeah, that's pretty much the time it took to create Rory. And that included getting dressed and freshening my lipstick."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Thanks for the book."
"LUKE: Caesar, cover for me."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks toward the staircase]"
"LORELAI: [from upstairs] Rory?"
"RORY: I'm coming."
"LORELAI: Toute de suite, and I don't mean the candy."
"[Rory walks into Lorelai's bedroom]"
"RORY: Okay, what's the packing crisis?"
"LORELAI: That's the thing. I have no packing crisis. For the first time in my life, there is no packing crisis. See? This has never happened to me before. I'm all packed, ready to go, and fully confident that I have everything I'll need or desire."
"RORY: So you're creating a crisis out of nostalgia?"
"LORELAI: No, see, Alex and I talked about everything we plan to do and how he expected to dress and how I expected to dress, and we coordinated to the point where I knew each piece of clothing I had to bring, down to the Spice Girls necklace I plan to wear Saturday morning for breakfast because we agreed to keep it a little whimsical."
"RORY: So, not your Jonas Salk necklace?"
"LORELAI: I'm trying to become as good a planner as you."
"RORY: So, what's the problem?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea what to wear on the drive. I wanna look good, obviously, but not too good that it steps on my night outfit, and I also wanna be comfortable."
"RORY: What's he wearing, a jogging suit?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, and then after, he and Paulie are hitting the Bada Bing."
"RORY: Your point being, it's probably not a running suit."
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: And tonight's a dress?"
"LORELAI: And, uh, my cashmere coat and a hat."
"RORY: Your stretchy jeans and your Bunnyranch T-shirt."
"LORELAI: Comfort and raunch, I love it. Good. So, um, how are you guys working the logistics tonight?"
"RORY: I am going to study at school, then I'm going straight to Grandma's from there. Jess is driving straight from work, and then he's driving me home."
"LORELAI: Home? Home here?"
"RORY: Yeah, he's gonna drop me off here."
"LORELAI: Well, I guess that makes sense."
"RORY: I thought so."
"LORELAI: Although, hm, I don't know."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Are you sure that's the best way to do it?"
"RORY: Yeah, why?"
"LORELAI: Well, it just means you're coming home to an empty house."
"RORY: Well, that's your doing, not mine."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but it might be kind of lonely here. Did you think about staying at Mom's?"
"RORY: Overnight?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. They've got those fancy beds that don't sag, and you're guaranteed a great Norma Desmond style breakfast the next morning. You don't have school, it works out perfectly."
"RORY: I'd rather just come home."
"LORELAI: Okay, sure. But, you know, staying at your grandmother's would also mean that Jess wouldn't have to go out of his way at the end of the night to drop you off. It would be much more convenient for him."
"RORY: Our house is two-tenths of a mile out of his way."
"LORELAI: Are you sure he's gonna have enough gas?"
"RORY: I'll make sure."
"LORELAI: But if you can't get a hold of him, it might be safer to plan on staying at Mom's. I mean, if you run out of gas, you're stuck. And at the mercy of the Orcs."
"RORY: Mom, why are you so freaked?"
"LORELAI: This is not freaked."
"RORY: Is it because you won't be here and he will?"
"LORELAI: Uh, it might've crossed my mind."
"RORY: And what are you worried about happening?"
"LORELAI: Well, what you guys were on the on-ramp for up at Luke's the other day. Your basic boy/girl stuff. Especially with this new boy, you girl stuff."
"RORY: Well, the boy is different, but I'm still me. That hasn't changed."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know."
"RORY: And I have so much on my mind, so many things going on in my life, that I don't ever have time to think about that."
"LORELAI: No thinking at all?"
"RORY: None, I swear."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm, sure, sure."
"RORY: And we talk about everything together, you and me, remember? So it's not like something will happen that you won't know about."
"LORELAI: Good. [doorbell rings] That's Alex. Come on."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily and Rory are sitting in the living room]"
"EMILY: You know, you didn't have to change."
"RORY: Well, I feel kind of dumb being in my uniform when I'm not in school."
"EMILY: But you look darling in it. I'm going to miss it when you go to college."
"RORY: Yeah, I am, too, in a way. I mean, I like not having to think about what I'm going to wear."
"EMILY: And you'll have plenty of years to stress yourself out about that."
"RORY: I'm sorry he's late."
"EMILY: We're fine. Dinner will keep."
"RORY: I know how you like things to be punctual."
"EMILY: There was a big tie-up on the 84 earlier. He's probably smack dab in the middle of that. Why don't you try him on his cell phone, see what's going on."
"RORY: He doesn't have one."
"EMILY: Really?"
"RORY: He doesn't believe in them."
"EMILY: Well, I find that refreshing. Technology is encroaching too fast on every aspect of life, if you ask me. It's getting to the point where people will want robots to carry them from place to place. [the doorbell rings] There he is."
"[they walk to the door. Jess is standing on the porch with a black eye]"
"RORY: What "
"JESS: Sorry I'm late."
"EMILY: Oh, that's all right. Come in, come in. It's cold out."
"RORY: Um, Grandma, this is Jess. Jess, my grandmother."
"EMILY: Nice to meet you."
"JESS: Same here."
"RORY: Uh, what happened to your eye?"
"JESS: It's a long story, I don't wanna bore you."
"EMILY: Oh, this is new?"
"RORY: Brand new."
"EMILY: It looks bad. Does it hurt?"
"JESS: I'm fine."
"RORY: Is it why you were late?"
"JESS: No, 84 was jammed."
"EMILY: We knew that, too. There was something with a big rig. Oh, those things, they scare the life out of me. And apparently, all the men who drive them are hopped up on bennies and goofballs. Come, come, have a seat at the table. I'll go check on dinner. [walks away]"
"JESS: Shouldn't we go with her?"
"RORY: Were you in a fight?"
"JESS: Dinner's waiting."
"RORY: Jess, were you in a fight?"
"JESS: I told you, it's a long story, I don't wanna talk about it."
"RORY: Why?"
"JESS: Look, Rory, I'm already in a crappy mood. Traffic sucked. Traffic I hit going to a function I didn't particularly wanna go to. And I'm thirsty. And I'm hungry. So let's eat."
"[they walk to the dining room]"
"JESS: So do we eat standing up?"
"RORY: Over there."
"[they sit at the table. Emily walks into the room]"
"EMILY: The roast looks perfect. Oh, Jess, you eat meat, I hope. I forgot to ask."
"JESS: I'm a carnivore."
"EMILY: Good. I don't see how anybody can resist eating meat."
"JESS: It's why we have teeth."
"EMILY: That's how I feel. Dinner parties used to be simple. Now every time we give one, I have to run my menu down with every person on the list. It's tiring. This one eats just about anything."
"RORY: Grandma."
"EMILY: I'm sorry, but the way you and your mother eat, and those slim figures of yours  it's a medical marvel."
"JESS: They should be studied."
"RORY: I don't think so."
"EMILY: So, Rory tells me you're part of the Wal-Mart corporation."
"JESS: Only out of necessity."
"EMILY: They sound like wonderful stores."
"JESS: Oh, yeah, I wanna be buried there."
"EMILY: We've never actually been inside one, but we own the stock."
"JESS: Thanks for the paycheck."
"EMILY: Oh, that's very funny."
"RORY: Did you just get it?"
"JESS: Huh?"
"RORY: The eye  did it just happen?"
"JESS: You know, we should eat these salads so the roast doesn't get cold."
"RORY: I mean, it must be sometime between nine last night and now."
"EMILY: Hm?"
"RORY: His eye."
"JESS: Yeah, it was sometime in there."
"RORY: But you can't narrow it down?"
"JESS: Rory, come on."
"EMILY: Oh my God, there's no salt and pepper on this table. We'll need it for the meat. These people are supposed to be trained before I get them, but God knows that's never the case. [leaves room]"
"JESS: What is your problem?"
"RORY: You're not telling me the truth, that's my problem."
"JESS: I don't wanna get into it here."
"RORY: And it's obvious why."
"JESS: Oh, is it?"
"RORY: You got into a fight with Dean."
"JESS: Unbelievable."
"RORY: Is that it?"
"JESS: It always comes back to Dean."
"RORY: Because you bring it there."
"JESS: You brought up Dean."
"RORY: Because you got into a fight with him."
"JESS: Why are you pressing this? Why? I'm trying to make some kind of quasi-positive impression on your grandmother per your request and you're forcing me to do otherwise. And what the hell are raisins doing in a salad? Why can't people leave well enough alone?"
"RORY: Well, in that whole speech, I didn't hear you deny it."
"[Emily walks back into the room]"
"EMILY: We've got great choices on the prime rib. How do you like your prime rib, Jess?"
"JESS: Cooked."
"RORY: He's not picky, Grandma."
"EMILY: Good, that'll make it easier. So, what did I miss?"
"JESS: Nothing. Absolutely nothing."
"RORY: Grandma, would it be all right if I speak to Jess for a second? We can go to the study."
"JESS: We're eating."
"RORY: Well, I want to talk."
"JESS: You're being a little rude to your grandmother, Rory."
"EMILY: I can leave the room for a minute if you want."
"RORY: No, Grandma, we'll be right back."
"[Rory and Jess walk to the study]"
"RORY: I told you nothing happened at Patty's, but you just wouldn't believe it. You had to get into a fight with Dean tonight right before meeting my grandmother. This is a disaster."
"JESS: I did not get into a fight with Dean."
"RORY: Bull."
"JESS: Believe what you want."
"RORY: I'm going to find out eventually, so why keep it from me?"
"JESS: What if Dean had sucker-punched me and I had to defend myself? You're not even considering the possibility that that's what happened?"
"RORY: Dean wouldn't do that."
"JESS: Oh, no, he might get his big white Stetson dirty."
"RORY: You're being a jerk to my grandmother, too."
"JESS: Hey, I'm doing my best. If that means I'm being a jerk, then that's what I am. I didn't even wanna come."
"RORY: No one made you."
"JESS: You made me. Now I've seen it all."
"RORY: You embarrassed me in front of her."
"JESS: That's it, I've had it."
"RORY: So have I."
"JESS: If you're gonna harp on this, I'm leaving."
"RORY: Oh, great, so now I have to explain to my Grandma why my boyfriend who showed up a half-hour late with a black eye is walking out."
"JESS: Well, you like making up stories in your head so that should be easy for you."
"[they walk to the front door. Jess leaves. Emily walks up to Rory]"
"EMILY: Is he fetching something from his car?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"EMILY: He left."
"RORY: Yeah, he left."
"EMILY: Well, you can take some prime rib back for him if you want. What do you say the girls have some dinner, huh?"
"CUT TO NEW YORK"
"[Lorelai, Alex, Sookie, and Jackson walk out of the theater]"
"JACKSON: So, good, good show."
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. Alex, thank you for getting us those tickets."
"SOOKIE: Great production value."
"JACKSON: Oh, amazing. I mean, the way they do lighting on these things."
"SOOKIE: It's magical, it's magical."
"ALEX: This is the worst piece of crap I've ever seen."
"LORELAI: What?"
"ALEX: I saw Moose m*rder. This stinks worse."
"SOOKIE: I thought it was me."
"JACKSON: I was dying in there."
"LORELAI: Every song is the same."
"SOOKIE: The same two notes."
"LORELAI: How does that happen?"
"SOOKIE: I feel so very bad. Yes, I feel so very sad."
"LORELAI: I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm mad."
"SOOKIE: I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm sad."
"JACKSON: I'm sorry  that's better, rent a theater."
"ALEX: Look, I say we hit a bar, get some drinks, continue plotting out this musical you guys are writing."
"LORELAI: Cool. We'll need pens and paper."
"SOOKIE: Just memorize it. I'm mad, I'm sad, I'm mad, I'm sad."
"JACKSON: We'll grab a cab."
"SOOKIE: Hey, that fits right in."
"[Sookie and Jackson walk away to hail a cab]"
"LORELAI: You're nice."
"ALEX: I try."
"[Lorelai pulls out her cell phone]"
"ALEX: Who are you expecting?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory. I mean, not that I'm expecting a call because a call could mean something bad, so, um, not getting a call is probably best."
"ALEX: Probably."
"LORELAI: I'm just gonna give her a call."
"ALEX: You know, on the drive down here, you made me promise to stop you if you were gonna call Rory for the wrong reason."
"LORELAI: But I left the iron on."
"ALEX: She'll turn it off."
"LORELAI: She's got this boy."
"ALEX: I know."
"LORELAI: I shouldn't call her."
"ALEX: It's up to you."
"JACKSON: Hey guys, we got a cab, and the driver likes our song."
"LORELAI: Putting away phone now."
"ALEX: Good girl."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Rory is asleep in bed. Her cell phone rings and wakes her up]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Good morning."
"RORY: Hey. It's early. Why are you calling so early?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. I must've screwed up the time difference. What time is it there?"
"RORY: The same time it is there."
"LORELAI: Ah, sorry."
"RORY: How's it going?"
"LORELAI: Good. A lot of walking. We all had pizza at John's in the village and wrote a musical."
"RORY: Good for you."
"LORELAI: Then we picked the same Dean Martin song on the jukebox twenty-five times and people started complaining, so we picked the Bee Gees' ""New York Mining Disaster"" and they begged for Dean Martin back."
"RORY: Sounds fun."
"LORELAI: So, how'd the dinner go?"
"RORY: Uh, not well. Far from well."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I'm at Grandma's."
"LORELAI: You stayed the night?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: What did she do? Did she make you stay because she didn't want Jess to drive you home? She is so untrusting. And to ruin this dinner  I'm gonna k*ll her."
"RORY: No, Grandma was great. The whole time, even when Jess was late."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"RORY: She was a saint. Staying over was my idea."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Jess and I got into the most horrible fight of my life and it was. . .ugh. I can't even say."
"LORELAI: I don't believe this."
"RORY: He showed up with a big black eye."
"LORELAI: A black guy?"
"RORY: Eye, a black eye. He got into a fight."
"LORELAI: With who, Dean?"
"RORY: He wouldn't say, but yes, and he was all standoffish about it and things got worse and worse and he walked out. It was all horrible."
"LORELAI: Wow, honey. I'm sorry. Are you okay?"
"RORY: I'm upset, but I'm okay."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"EMILY: Oh, I thought I heard you up. How bout some breakfast?"
"RORY: Sure."
"EMILY: Is that Jess?"
"RORY: No, it's Mom."
"LORELAI: Hey, put her on."
"RORY: She wants to talk to you. Bye."
"LORELAI: See ya tonight."
"[Rory hands Emily the phone, then leaves the room]"
"EMILY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Mom, hi, listen. Rory kind of explained what happened last night, and how you were really great about it. I just wanted to thank you. I mean, I don't know all the details, but I'm sure it all could've been way worse, and you keeping your cool like that was really, really nice. Thanks."
"EMILY: How can you let your daughter be with that abominable thug?"
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: First he arrives late, how disrespectful is that? Then he's rude to Rory, rude to me."
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: Oh, and that attitude  I wanted to slap that monosyllabic mouth of his. And God forbid they're in another accident together or his heap of a car breaks down and Lord Jim has decided cell phones are beneath him and they're stranded in the middle of nowhere. How can you let this happen? He had a black eye. He belongs in jail!"
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Dave, Zach, and Brian drive down the street and stop at a stop light. Dave turns off the car radio]"
"ZACH: Yo, dude, that's disrespectful."
"DAVE: We're really early. Let's get something to eat."
"ZACH: Sure, what do we want?"
"BRIAN: I've only got three bucks."
"ZACH: You always only got three bucks. What is it, you go to an ATM that only gives out three bucks at a time?"
"DAVE: Let's just pick."
"BRIAN: Well, I'm sick of burgers, so if it could be a place that has more than burgers "
"ZACH: What do you want, like a three-dollar sushi place?"
"BRIAN: It doesn't have to be sushi."
"[Dave sees Mrs. Kim walking toward them]"
"DAVE: Guys, shut up and be cool. Don't say a thing."
"BRIAN: What, why?"
"DAVE: Mrs. Kim, hello."
"MRS. KIM: David."
"ZACH: David?"
"BRIAN: Mrs. Kim. You're Lane's mom?"
"MRS. KIM: How do you know Lane?"
"ZACH: She's a great dr "
"DAVE: Girl. We all think so."
"MRS. KIM: Who are you? What is all this, David? Who are all these unwashed boys?"
"DAVE: Well, see, Zach and Brian here play in a combo with me when I don't play solo."
"MRS. KIM: A combo?"
"DAVE: A Christian combo."
"MRS. KIM: Oh, good. With just a guitar it can sound thin."
"DAVE: Well, that's why we play music together. Uh, the light's turned, we should probably get "
"MRS. KIM: Wait, I want to warn you about something."
"DAVE: Yes?"
"MRS. KIM: About Lane. She has a crush on you."
"DAVE: She does?"
"MRS. KIM: I thought you should know. She's a good girl, but flighty sometimes. Be careful around her. I know you're a serious boy, I don't want you to be shocked."
"DAVE: Oh, no, thank you. I'll be very careful, I promise."
"MRS. KIM: Okay. Maybe I'll book your combo sometime, mix it up a little."
"DAVE: It would be our pleasure. Right, guys?"
"ZACH: Yeah."
"BRIAN: Sure."
"MRS. KIM: Don't speed. [walks away]"
"DAVE: Okay, so, uh, where do we wanna eat?"
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Rory walks up to Dean]"
"RORY: Hey."
"DEAN: Hey there. Did you see those fliers? Apparently, I clicked my heels for joy after one of her songs. I don't remember that."
"RORY: Me neither. Can I talk to you for a sec?"
"DEAN: Well, yeah, what's wrong?"
"RORY: Dean, this whole friend thing with us isn't going to work if we're not honest with each other."
"DEAN: I agree."
"RORY: Okay, so, anything you wanna tell me?"
"DEAN: Corn's two for a dollar?"
"RORY: Jess has a black eye."
"DEAN: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Any idea where he got it?"
"DEAN: That would be an extremely long list."
"RORY: It wasn't you?"
"DEAN: It wasn't me."
"RORY: You swear?"
"DEAN: I swear. Did he say it was me?"
"RORY: No, he's not saying anything. He's less talkative than some."
"DEAN: Yeah, sorry, I have no idea. Look, I really don't like talking about "
"RORY: I know, sorry, I "
"DEAN: I should get back to work."
"RORY: Okay, thanks."
"DEAN: Sorry I couldn't solve the mystery."
"RORY: Me, too."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is behind the counter, Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"LUKE: Whoa."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: You're Petey the dog."
"JESS: I prefer to not talk about this."
"LUKE: Is that why you snuck in last night?"
"JESS: I did not sneak in. Now, could we get back to work here?"
"LUKE: Fine, start clearing some stuff. So when'd you get into a fight with Dean?"
"JESS: It wasn't a fight with Dean."
"LUKE: Whoa, where's that coming from? I just asked."
"JESS: What's with everybody making assumptions? I'm sick of it."
"LUKE: So it wasn't Dean."
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: When did it happen, yesterday?"
"JESS: Yes."
"LUKE: You went to Rory's grandmother yesterday. She punch you?"
"JESS: Stop."
"LUKE: Where'd you get it?"
"JESS: Santa Claus."
"LUKE: So you're not gonna tell me?"
"JESS: That's right."
"[phone rings]"
"LUKE: [answers] Hello? Yeah, hey Rory, hang on a sec. [to Jess] It's Rory."
"JESS: I'm not here."
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: Get a clue, Columbo. I don't wanna talk to her."
"LUKE: You don't wanna talk to Rory? [to Rory] Yeah, Rory? Yeah, he just went someplace. Yeah, I'll tell him. Bye."
"[Luke hangs up the phone, then grabs Jess by his shirt]"
"LUKE: Come on."
"JESS: Hey."
"[Luke pulls him to the storage room]"
"JESS: Come on, what is this?"
"LUKE: Look, you're my responsibility. You're exhibiting signs of violent behavior and I don't care how much you don't wanna talk about it, you're not leaving until you tell me. Now, tell me, where'd you get the black eye?"
"JESS: You wouldn't believe it anyway."
"LUKE: Try me, tough guy."
"JESS: A swan."
"LUKE: Excuse me?"
"JESS: I was attacked by a swan. Okay, you happy? A stupid swan."
"LUKE: Now, how bout the real story?"
"JESS: That is the real story. It hangs out by Larson's Dock. I was just walking by and the thing came out of nowhere and bam  beaked me right in the eye."
"LUKE: It beaked you?"
"JESS: You still don't believe me."
"LUKE: I just never heard anyone use the word beaked as a verb before."
"JESS: No, no, this isn't funny. That stupid bird attacked me. He could've blinded me. It's a vicious, vicious bird, and . . .fine. Forget it."
"[they walk back into the diner. Jess retrieves a ladle from under the counter]"
"LUKE: What are you doing? Where are you going?"
"JESS: I'm gonna do a little beaking of my own."
"LUKE: Jess, not the ladle. That's a brand new ladle. Take the baster!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Luke and Jess are in a rowboat in the middle of the lake]"
"LUKE: I don't see a swan."
"JESS: Put your oars down."
"LUKE: They don't like oars?"
"JESS: Just lay low, it'll come."
"LUKE: Does it act all peaceful and Bambi-like and then suddenly attack like the rabbit in Monty Python?"
"JESS: Your voice is probably scaring it away."
"LUKE: So how'd you explain the black eye to the Gilmores?"
"JESS: I didn't. The whole night sucked. I'm happy it's behind me."
"LUKE: Behind you? You ain't got nothing behind you."
"JESS: What do you mean?"
"LUKE: You'll have plenty more events like that in your future."
"JESS: No way."
"LUKE: When you date a girl like Rory, you're involved with her whole family. Just like that last girl you dated, you were involved with her whole petri dish."
"JESS: At least she was easy to figure out."
"LUKE: And you were bored from day one."
"JESS: I'm dating Rory, not her family."
"LUKE: All these people come in a package with this girl. The mother comes with this girl. The grandmother comes with this girl."
"JESS: And apparently a bunch of others. Everybody she's ever met, including Dean."
"LUKE: She picked you."
"JESS: God knows why."
"LUKE: She knows, that's all that matters. Jess, being jealous of Dean "
"JESS: I am not jealous of Dean."
"LUKE: Being jealous of Dean is pointless. You're just gonna drive Rory away. You wanna have a relationship with someone, you're gonna have to learn to open up your mouth and say something."
"JESS: Give it a rest, Dr. Phil."
"LUKE: You can't shut down, you can't avoid her calls."
"JESS: I didn't wanna talk."
"LUKE: Well, when are you gonna wanna talk?"
"JESS: I don't know."
"LUKE: So, what are you gonna do, just keep avoiding her and never take her calls again?"
"JESS: She'll find me eventually."
"LUKE: If she keeps looking for you."
"JESS: Hey, I'm not gonna be a wuss like Dean."
"LUKE: Dean had that girl for two years. You have a little fight after two months, you walk out, and it's over?"
"JESS: I don't care."
"LUKE: Okay, fine, you don't care, that's obvious."
"[Jess sees a swan]"
"JESS: Shh!"
"LUKE: Is that the one?"
"JESS: That's it. Watch it."
"LUKE: I'm watching it. It's pretty."
"JESS: Shh!"
"LUKE: Is it gonna double back?"
"JESS: Maybe."
"LUKE: So it's lulling us into complacency."
"JESS: He's vicious, I'm telling you."
"LUKE: Yeah, his butt's terrifying."
"JESS: It's outnumbered. That's the problem. It knows there's two of us."
"LUKE: So you want me to get under water, swim along with the boat, breathe through a straw?"
"JESS: Forget it."
"LUKE: Maybe it's gonna get another swan and come back and make a fight of it, huh?"
"JESS: Forget it."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S GARAGE"
"[Rory is talking to Lane as she sets up for band practice]"
"LANE: He's not even calling you back, huh?"
"RORY: No, and I'm not sure what to do."
"LANE: Well, Dave and I have never had a fight because we haven't really truly g*n dating, so I have no perspective on this."
"RORY: Well, you'd better hurry up and start having bad boy troubles so I can get some feedback."
"[The band walks into the garage]"
"DAVE: Hey there."
"LANE: Hi guys."
"RORY: How's it going?"
"ZACH: I think it's going a little weird, to tell you the truth."
"LANE: Weird, why?"
"BRIAN: I think we need to get something out in the open here."
"ZACH: Definitely."
"DAVE: We ran into your mom."
"LANE: My mom?"
"RORY: Oh boy."
"ZACH: Yeah, and we're well aware that there's a situation here that you guys have been hiding."
"BRIAN: We should get it out in the open here or else it's gonna get weirder."
"DAVE: Yeah, I guess so. We didn't mean anything by hiding it guys."
"ZACH: Well, what pisses us off is that you felt you had to hide it."
"DAVE: Really?"
"ZACH: Yeah. Dave, you're a Christian. So what? That's cool."
"BRIAN: It's nothing to hide."
"ZACH: Christians can still rock."
"DAVE: They can?"
"LANE: Yeah, yeah, Dave. Christians can still rock, don't hide it."
"ZACH: Marshall Stacks don't know Christians from atheists."
"DAVE: Gosh, I just wasn't sure if you guys would be accepting of my devoutness."
"BRIAN: Dave, it's a part of you, and we think you're cool, so it's cool."
"DAVE: Great. Thanks, guys."
"ZACH: But no way are we playing Creed, man."
"DAVE: Oh, no, of course not."
"ZACH: Or Amy Grant. That's where we draw the line."
"LANE: This is very accepting of you guys."
"BRIAN: And we'd be totally into playing that gig for your mom if it pays."
"LANE: Oh, Mrs. Kim pays. Uh, she's very good about that."
"[a car horn honks from the yard]"
"RORY: That's my mom. I'm glad this all worked out."
"LANE: Yeah, me too."
"[Rory walks to the front yard. Alex is getting Lorelai's suitcase out of the trunk of his SUV]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Oh, my little daughter."
"RORY: I'm happy to see you. Thanks for bringing her back in one piece."
"ALEX: No problem."
"LORELAI: I'm very weak."
"ALEX: She hasn't eaten in awhile."
"RORY: I warned you to keep to her feeding schedule."
"LORELAI: I'm drifting, drifting."
"ALEX: She wanted to wait to have dinner with you."
"RORY: That's sweet."
"LORELAI: Must have food now."
"RORY: I'll take it from here."
"ALEX: Thanks."
"LORELAI: Bye. [to Rory] You're not food."
"ALEX: Revive her."
"RORY: I will. I'm gonna run and get take out."
"LORELAI: Oh, make like the wind."
"RORY: Can you make it to the door?"
"LORELAI: I'll struggle."
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[Rory walks by the diner with some takeout bags. Jess walks out]"
"JESS: Rory."
"RORY: Oh, hey."
"JESS: Hey. Your mom home?"
"RORY: I'm bringing supplies."
"JESS: Should've brought a mule."
"RORY: What?"
"JESS: A pack mule, to carry it."
"RORY: Oh, yeah."
"JESS: So, sorry I missed your calls."
"RORY: You were always out."
"JESS: Yeah. I was getting ready to call you just now, but you would've been out."
"RORY: Ironic."
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: So, I know there was no fight with Dean."
"JESS: Really? How? You asked Dean."
"RORY: It was the only thing I could think to do."
"JESS: To go to the source."
"RORY: Yup. I'm sorry I doubted you."
"JESS: It's okay. I would've doubted me, too."
"RORY: I need to trust you as much as I trusted "
"JESS: Him."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: This black eye screwed everything up."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Next time I go to your grandmother's, I'll try not to have one."
"RORY: Next time?"
"JESS: Next time."
"RORY: So what happened?"
"JESS: I don't "
"RORY: Come on. It wasn't Dean, you can say."
"JESS: Will that make you happy?"
"RORY: Yes, very."
"JESS: Okay, I'll tell you the truth, since we're both so into the truth tonight. That's what good relationships are about, right?"
"RORY: Right."
"JESS: But you've gotta promise not to mock me ever, and please don't tell anyone else."
"RORY: Promise."
"JESS: I was throwing a football with a buddy and got hit in the eye."
"RORY: You poor thing."
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: But that's not embarrassing."
"JESS: Yeah, now that you mention it, it's not."
"RORY: I have to go."
"JESS: Don't go."
"RORY: I don't want to."
"JESS: Then don't. Let's go somewhere."
"RORY: I've got takeout."
"JESS: I'll reimburse you."
"RORY: My mom's waiting. Keep thinking what you're thinking."
"JESS: I don't have a choice."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is lying on the couch, Rory walks in with the takeout]"
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Hm? Is that you, Rhett?"
"RORY: I bring food."
"LORELAI: Oh, thank God. Ha! One of everything at Al's. Bless you with gluttony. Aren't you hungry?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Well, come on, dig in. What's wrong?"
"RORY: Nothing. Um, listen."
"LORELAI: I'm listening."
"RORY: When I said before that I was too busy to think about it, I realized now that I'm not too busy to think about it."
"LORELAI: Think about it?"
"RORY: About it."
"LORELAI: Oh, it."
"RORY: Yeah, it."
"LORELAI: Ha, it."
"RORY: Nothing's happened yet, but. . .it might. Maybe."
"LORELAI: Maybe?"
"RORY: Maybe. . .with Jess."
"LORELAI: Hm, with Jess."
"RORY: You still want me to tell you everything, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Uh, no. Well "
"RORY: Which is it?"
"LORELAI: We're doing this now."
"RORY: Yes. Which is it?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: You'll let me know?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Was that, yeah, you'll let me know, or yeah, that's your answer, you wanna know?"
"LORELAI: I guess, I wanna know, yes, and now, sure."
"RORY: Well, nothing's happened."
"LORELAI: I heard."
"RORY: But it might."
"LORELAI: Okay. Could you tell me before it does?"
"RORY: Right before, or "
"LORELAI: No, just. . .just before."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. Is that it?"
"RORY: For tonight, yeah."
"LORELAI: Good. This. . .this is good."
"RORY: Yeah, it is good."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, let's eat."
"RORY: Good."
"[They start eating. Lorelai puts her arm around Rory. Rory puts her arm around Lorelai. They continue eating.]"

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table with Taylor]"
"TAYLOR: So, I have talked to every member of my family and we agreed that you can hold the rooms on my credit card, but everyone must check out with their own."
"LORELAI: Got it."
"TAYLOR: Have we gone over the room arrangements yet?"
"LORELAI: Closing in on a hundred and fifty times."
"TAYLOR: Well, the Doose clan is very, very particular about their accommodations. We are light sleepers and are prone to night terrors, and several of us are very allergic to bed clothing, so it's very important that we are "
"LORELAI: On the first floor or near a fire escape. Yes, Taylor, I know, it's all taken care of. Um, Taylor, could you just hang on a second? I'll be right back."
"TAYLOR: Oh, all right, but hurry. I don't have all day."
"[Lorelai walks to the counter where Rory is talking to Jess]"
"LORELAI: Hey. You were supposed to bring me a cup of coffee."
"RORY: Yes, I know. I'm sorry, I got distracted."
"JESS: My fault."
"LORELAI: Yes, but see, when you left me there, I was alone, and now, look, I'm no longer alone."
"RORY: Taylor found you?"
"LORELAI: Yes, and we've since embarked on hour one hundred millionth of planning the special Doose reunion."
"RORY: I'm coming back over there right now."
"LORELAI: Yes, and then you are going to get very sick and be unable to feed yourself so that Mommy will need to take you home and stay by your side until the Doose reunion is over."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay. Say goodbye to Jess."
"RORY: Bye Jess."
"JESS: I'll call you later."
"LORELAI: Oh, limp a little if you can."
"RORY: Uh, what malady do I have that makes me limp and lose ability to feed myself?"
"LORELAI: It's French."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they walk over to Taylor]"
"LORELAI: Taylor, listen, we're gonna need to finish this up a little later. Rory's not feeling so good."
"TAYLOR: Oh no, what's the matter?"
"RORY: It's French."
"TAYLOR: All right. Well, I think we're just about done here anyhow. Oh, before I forget, let me give you each one of these. [hands them each a button]"
"RORY: [reads button] ""Stars Hollow Hockey, 2003 semifinalists. Go Minutemen. The future is yours. Bring this button to Doose's for fifty percent off your next purchase of Stove Top Stuffing."" Wow, that's a lot of words for a tiny button."
"TAYLOR: I expect to see both of you wearing them at the game tomorrow night."
"LORELAI: Well, we'll try to make it."
"TAYLOR: Try to make it? My dear, do you realize that this is the first time we've been in the regional semifinals in forty-three years?"
"RORY: But didn't we only make it this far because the Litchfield team got food poisoning?"
"TAYLOR: Well, I admit it's not exactly the plot of Hoosiers, but still it's very, very exciting."
"LORELAI: Well, it's nice that you and your family are so loyal to the home team."
"TAYLOR: Oh, the Dooses have been the backbone of Stars Hollow High hockey for years. I, myself, was the goalkeeper for our team in the last regional finals."
"LORELAI: I did not know that."
"TAYLOR: Oh yes. I was responsible for the game-winning goal."
"LUKE: So the puck just ricocheted off your head and into the net?"
"TAYLOR: Still counted."
"LUKE: For God's sake, I was making a joke. You really got pucked in the head?"
"TAYLOR: No, I was making a joke, too. Uh, Lorelai, just one more "
"[Taylor looks out the window and sees Lorelai and Rory running down the street]"
"TAYLOR: What a disgrace, making that poor sick girl run."
"LUKE: Wow, you can see the dent."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Richard are eating dinner]"
"RICHARD: So, Rory, how are things at Chilton?"
"RORY: Great, great, everything's great."
"RICHARD: And, uh, Lorelai, things at the inn are good?"
"LORELAI: Mm, mmhmm, hm."
"RICHARD: Oh, Rory, please slow down and chew your food properly."
"LORELAI: I'm always telling her that. Pass the butter."
"RORY: Pass the peas."
"LORELAI: Pass the pork."
"RORY: Pass your plate."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, is there a race going on I don't know about?"
"[Emily walks into the room]"
"EMILY: That was your mother, Richard. She just wanted to make sure that all our towels are Egyptian cotton."
"RICHARD: Well, it's a simple question."
"EMILY: It's her fortieth simple question of the day."
"RICHARD: Well, she's going to be staying with us, Emily. She just wants to know she'll be comfortable."
"EMILY: Yes, because we usually give our guests the towels we've stolen from the Holiday Inn."
"RORY: Great Grandma's coming to stay with you?"
"RICHARD: Just for a few days, um, while her floors are being redone."
"LORELAI: So, how's Gran doing?"
"RORY: Yeah, does she miss London?"
"EMILY: Not half as much as I do."
"RICHARD: Emily."
"EMILY: I never really truly appreciated the Atlantic Ocean before. Three thousand lovely miles of water."
"RICHARD: You are talking about my mother."
"EMILY: I know that, Richard. And I'm happy to have her stay here, but must she keep interrupting the one dinner a week that we have with Lorelai and Rory? She knows what time we dine  and why are you two eating so quickly?"
"LORELAI: We're not eating quickly."
"RORY: Yeah, you've been on the phone for awhile. It probably just seems like we've eaten a lot."
"[phone rings]"
"EMILY: I wonder who that could be."
"RICHARD: Emily."
"[doorbell rings]"
"EMILY: Well, aren't we popular? Richard, perhaps you could get that while I have another bath sheet versus bath towel debate with your mother."
"[Richard and Emily leave the room]"
"LORELAI: You're giving it away!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You're eating too quickly."
"RORY: What? You said that we had to be out of here by 8:30."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but I didn't tell you to broadcast it."
"RORY: I'm eating at the same speed you are."
"LORELAI: But you're eating small bites very fast. You've gotta eat bigger bites at a normal speed."
"RORY: You mean I should risk choking so we can make our Friday night plans?"
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"[Richard returns to the table]"
"RICHARD: I apologize for that."
"LORELAI: Collection agency again?"
"RICHARD: Excuse me?"
"[Emily returns to the room]"
"EMILY: Thank goodness she called. Richard, did you know people actually expect there to be soap in their bathrooms when they. . ."
"[Emily hears a noise. She looks into the living room and sees two men carrying a mattress up the steps]"
"EMILY: Why are there strange men hauling a mattress up my staircase?"
"RICHARD: Well, now, Emily "
"EMILY: She sent her own mattress?"
"RICHARD: Well, she has a very sensitive back."
"EMILY: She sent her own mattress?"
"RICHARD: I'll go and supervise. [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Well, Mom, it looks like you got a lot going on here."
"RORY: With the mattresses and the phone calls."
"LORELAI: Yeah, so we're just gonna go and get out of your hair."
"EMILY: Hold it right there. What is going on with you two?"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"EMILY: You know exactly what I'm talking about. Bolting down your food, leaving before dessert, Rory checking her pager every five minutes. What do you have planned? Fine, we'll just sit here until one of you feels like filling me in."
"LORELAI: She has a date!"
"RORY: So does she!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, but hers starts a half-hour earlier than mine!"
"RORY: Because you get to stay out later!"
"LORELAI: Because I'm the mom!"
"EMILY: You two, stop it right now! You're behaving like children."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: Yeah, sorry."
"EMILY: Our deal is for Friday night dinners, not appearances at Friday night dinners. Now, you will sit there and you will eat your dessert."
"LORELAI: But "
"EMILY: One more word and I throw in a game of charades."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Yes, Mom."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory rush into the house]"
"LORELAI: Oh, we gotta get a faster car!"
"RORY: Hey, don't blame the car."
"LORELAI: So you're saying it's my fault we're late?"
"RORY: Who was the one who said, ""Hey, I've got room for another piece of pie."""
"[Lorelai goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Ah! You kept making all that pointless conversation, all those thank you's and please's. What, are you running for Miss Congeniality?"
"RORY: Just get ready."
"LORELAI: What time are you meeting Jess?"
"RORY: I don't know, I'll tell you in a sec. [checks answering machine]"
"LORELAI: Have you seen my brown boots? I cannot go out without those brown boots. My entire outfit was retrofitted around those practically  Oh! Wait, can you believe it? Hey, they were in my closet. What sort of bizarre accident of fate put them there?"
"[Lorelai walks back downstairs]"
"LORELAI: What? He didn't call? Well, maybe it's too early. What time is it?"
"RORY: 9:15."
"LORELAI: And when did he say he would call?"
"RORY: When he got off work."
"LORELAI: Which was when?"
"RORY: It varies."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I thought you guys had a plan."
"RORY: We did."
"LORELAI: And the plan was that he calls you whenever because his work time varies?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Good plan. Bay of Pigs, was that yours, too?"
"RORY: He'll call."
"LORELAI: Hey, look, you wanna come out with me and Alex? We might go see a midnight movie if something really bad is playing."
"RORY: No, thanks."
"LORELAI: Just promise me you won't sit here all night staring at the phone."
"RORY: [turns on TV] Happy?"
"LORELAI: Delirious. Oh, I should not have had that second piece of pie."
"RORY: Full?"
"LORELAI: No, just late."
"RORY: Bring me some Milk Duds."
"LORELAI: It's a plan!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the town square]"
"RORY: Then I spent about forty minutes cleaning out my hard drive. You would not believe the amount of junk that accumulates  old files, things you've downloaded but never opened. It really slows down your CPU."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I hate a slow CPU."
"RORY: Then, all of a sudden, I looked down and I saw all this hair and dust between the keys of my keyboard."
"LORELAI: So, naturally, you cleaned your keyboard."
"RORY: Yes, and I'll tell you, it was a strangely satisfying experience."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. One question. During this time that you watched TV, did homework, proofread articles for The Franklin, organized my sock drawer, returned emails and gave a much needed cleaning to your computer, did it ever occur to you to call him?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because he said he'd call me."
"LORELAI: Right. Okay, so then I'm guessing you're not gonna mention anything to him about your extremely productive evening alone when you see him either."
"RORY: Why should I?"
"LORELAI: No reason I can think of."
"[They stop to look at Stars Hollow High, which has been toilet papered by a rival school]"
"LORELAI: You know, I almost like it better like this."
"RORY: It is more festive."
"[they see Dean on a ladder helping remove the toilet paper]"
"LORELAI: Good luck tonight!"
"RORY: Sure, when Dean said he'd call, he always called, but where's the fun in that?"
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, don't do that."
"RORY: Do what?"
"LORELAI: Compare Dean and Jess, that's not fair. They're different people."
"RORY: Clearly. One calls when he says he will and one doesn't."
"LORELAI: Okay, for starters, I think you have to realize something  you were really lucky with Dean. He was an exceptional first boyfriend, and you got spoiled. Most of us didn't have first boyfriends like Dean. Most of us had first boyfriends like Brian Hutchins."
"RORY: Brian Hutchins?"
"LORELAI: Seventh grade, I'm sitting in the library, walks up, asks me to go steady. I say yes. He walks away and I don't see him again until the tenth grade when he tries to sell me a dimebag at the Sadies Hawkins Day dance. And he was way overcharging for it, too."
"RORY: That's demented."
"LORELAI: Well, that's what most of us had to put up with. Where do you think the Susan Faludi's of the world came from?"
"RORY: So, you're telling me this is just the way it is, and I have to get used to Jess not calling when he says he will?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm saying you just have to realize that every guy is different. Give Jess a chance to explain before you freeze him out."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they walk into the diner]"
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: Hey. That table's clean if you want it. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Well, I hope that cleared it up for you."
"RORY: Not a word. Not even a lame-o apology that is obviously a lie."
"LORELAI: Yeah, how dare he not lie to you."
"LUKE: Finally, two people who don't give a damn about hockey."
"LORELAI: Oh, someone's testy."
"LUKE: Well, just look at these dippy people with their buttons and their pennants. You'd think the town had never been in a semi-regional playoff before."
"RORY: But hasn't it been like forty years?"
"LUKE: Yeah, for the hockey team, yeah. But back when I was on the track team, we went to state three times in four years and won it twice. Think they made buttons and put up banners? They couldn't care less."
"LORELAI: Well, Luke, that's because track is for dorks."
"RORY: Yeah, it's true. I'm sorry."
"LUKE: Okay, the conversing part of this morning is now over. What do you want?"
"LORELAI: Jack omelet, bacon on the side."
"RORY: Three blueberry and two lemon poppy seed muffins to go. Lane's band is rehearsing at my house. I wanted to bring them something."
"LUKE: You got that, Jess?"
"JESS: Yup."
"LUKE: Be right back."
"JESS: Five muffins to go."
"RORY: Thank you. I'll see you later. [leaves]"
"JESS: What was that, you guys in a fight or something?"
"LORELAI: No, you are."
"JESS: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: Last night, didn't you guys have plans to do something?"
"JESS: I don't know. I just said I'd call her after work."
"LORELAI: And did you?"
"JESS: I had to work another shift, I didn't get off until midnight. It was too late to call."
"LORELAI: And you couldn't have taken two seconds at work to call and tell her that?"
"JESS: No."
"LORELAI: Really? You don't get breaks? Do you get food, water? Should I get Michael Moore on the phone?"
"JESS: Whatever. I gotta unload some boxes. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Nice talking to you."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory and Lane walk out of the house toward the garage, where the band is practicing]"
"LANE: See, I knew once my mom found out Dave was part of a Christian trio, it was only a matter of time before she booked him to play at one of her prayer meetings."
"RORY: It's perfect. Now your mom's gonna get to know the whole band."
"LANE: Not just get to know them, but love them the way she loves Dave."
"RORY: Your mom loves Dave?"
"LANE: She said he's a righteous young man who's proven he can be trusted around antique furniture. In her book, that's pretty close to love."
"RORY: Oh, sure."
"ZACH: [sings] ""A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing."" Dude, what's a bulwark?"
"BRIAN: What?"
"ZACH: It says, a bulwark never failing."
"BRIAN: I think it's a wall."
"ZACH: Then why don't they just say that? Bulwark sounds totally gay."
"BRIAN: I don't think you're supposed to call a hymn gay. It's like a sin or something."
"ZACH: Whatever, man. I'm not saying bulwark."
"RORY: So, Dave, Lane just gets to sit back and watch you guys play tonight, huh? You're like a groupie."
"DAVE: No, actually, she's got a date."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah. Remember Young Chui, the guy my mom introduced me to at the wedding? She arranged for him to take me to the hockey game tonight."
"RORY: Oh."
"DAVE: It's the first of three dates."
"RORY: The first of three?"
"DAVE: Then he's gonna dump her."
"RORY: Young Chui, the guy you haven't gone out with yet?"
"LANE: Yes. And I'll be crushed, making my mom feel so guilty about setting me up with him that she'll have to let me go out with Dave to make up for it."
"DAVE: I came up with that twist."
"LANE: Dave has a natural gift for subterfuge."
"DAVE: Wow, a compliment from the master. [walks away]"
"LANE: I would've thought of it myself, but I let him take the credit."
"RORY: Men sometimes need that."
"ZACH: I'm telling you dude, it doesn't make any sense."
"BRIAN: Fine, stop yelling at me. I didn't write it."
"DAVE: Whoa, whoa. Uh, what's wrong?"
"ZACH: This stupid song, man. ""For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe."" I mean, who talks like that, the Pope?"
"BRIAN: Dude, is any of those lemon poppy seed?"
"DAVE: Well, can't you update it a little?"
"ZACH: Sure, man. Just tell me what the hell it means. It's like in Latin or something."
"BRIAN: I thought there was gonna be coffee, too."
"ZACH: Dude, can you chill out about your freaking elevensees til we get this song straightened out?"
"BRIAN: I'm hypoglycemic. If I don't get something in my system, I'm gonna crash."
"DAVE: Is abi-death a word?"
"RORY: But how are you gonna make Young Chui dump you? Just be a really bad date?"
"LANE: Oh, no, we've already talked to him. He's totally on board."
"RORY: Really?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah. See, he's in love with this Japanese girl named Karen who his parents don't approve of, so he and Karen see each other secretly while his parents keep setting him up with nice Korean girls. He's the male me."
"RORY: Gotcha."
"LANE: Hey, you and Jess should come with us to the game tonight. It'll be fun."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm not sure what we're doing tonight."
"ZACH: [sings] ""A mighty fortress is our God, a wall ten stories high. And he helps us when things get bad and the devil tries to hurt us."""
"RORY: What hymn is that?"
"LANE: I have no idea."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Taylor is in the lobby talking to his family]"
"TAYLOR: If for some reason, you should get separated from the group, you'll find a map on the third page of your welcome packet."
"DOUG: Why'd you draw your store so big?"
"TAYLOR: It just makes it easier to find if you get lost."
"DOUG: It's bigger than the school."
"MAN 1: And why'd you put all those P's in soda shop? Is that supposed to fancy or something?"
"MICHEL: You are in room twelve, and your father is "
"MAN 2: Are you from France?"
"MICHEL: Excuse me?"
"MAN 2: You talk funny. You from France."
"MICHEL: Yes. So, as I was saying "
"MAN 2: I was in France during the Big One."
"MICHEL: Oh, that's nice. So -"
"MAN 2: Nice? It was a w*r. What's nice about that?"
"MICHEL: Of course. So, your father is "
"MAN 2: Don't give me that attitude, Frenchy. You'd be speaking German now if it wasn't for me."
"LORELAI: Just make sure to have the vans back at 3:45 to take them to the game."
"TAYLOR: Oh, Lorelai, just a second. I wanted to "
"DOUG: Hold on there, what is this?"
"TAYLOR: That's the itinerary I've worked out for the afternoon. I thought Lorelai could post it in case some of the inn's other guests wanted to join us in our pre-game activities. Oh, Lorelai, this is my older brother Doug. Doug, this is Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hello."
"DOUG: Nice to meet you. Taylor, I told you on the phone, no one is gonna wanna do any of this crap. A tour of Stars Hollow? Most of us were born here. What do we need a tour for? Everyone, listen up. We're meeting down here in two hours for the vans to the game. You're late, you're walking. Go back to your store and count peaches or something. I'm taking a nap."
"[Lorelai walks toward the front desk]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, hello."
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"EMILY: You remember, I'm so touched."
"LORELAI: What are you doing here?"
"EMILY: Well, I was thinking about possibly having our next DAR luncheon here."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"EMILY: That's right. So I thought I would stop by and make sure the place is as charming as I remember. It is."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, what day would you like to have the meeting?"
"EMILY: The fifteenth."
"LORELAI: The fifteenth. Um, well, the fifteenth looks wide open, so you're officially down for the fifteenth."
"EMILY: Wonderful."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"EMILY: Okay."
"LORELAI: So."
"EMILY: So, how is Michel?"
"LORELAI: Michel's fine."
"EMILY: Well, good. I'm glad to hear it."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm glad to tell it. But Mom, I have this really big family reunion party that invaded the place today, so I should probably get back to work."
"EMILY: Oh, yes, you go right ahead. Do not let me keep you."
"LORELAI: Okay. Mom?"
"EMILY: I'm not allowed to go home."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: She's banished me from my own house"
"LORELAI: Gran?"
"EMILY: She's gone mad. This morning she announces that she's hosting a meeting of her bitter old biddies club at our house tonight and she needs the entire day to prepare because the house is in such a shambles."
"LORELAI: Nice, subtle."
"EMILY: Then I was handed a list of chores and asked not to come home until at least six o'clock because I would simply be in the way."
"LORELAI: Mom, she's only staying with you for a few days."
"EMILY: I have to buy her flowers. She doesn't like mine, they're too tall. It's ostentatious to have flowers that tall."
"LORELAI: Actually, I've been meaning to mention that to you myself."
"EMILY: I have to get new guest towels. I have to get new highball glasses. I have to get four very specific types of cheese. And I have to get a slide projector because they're going to view slides of potential acquisitions for the museum that they're on the board of."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom "
"EMILY: Of course, I haven't the faintest idea of where to find a slide projector. I feel like I'm going insane."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: I'm sorry. I think I'm just a little sensitive right now. It's selfish, I know, but Richard's traveling more than he ever did. He's been gone three of the last four weeks, and now he's finally home, and she's there commanding all of his attention, all of his time. I sound like a spoiled high school girl."
"LORELAI: Not quite. You still haven't asked for the Gloria Vanderbilt jeans and the convertible Rabbit."
"EMILY: Oh, never mind. I'm sorry I kept you from your work."
"LORELAI: Mom, listen, I have a slide projector. I'd be happy to bring it over tonight."
"EMILY: Oh, I really appreciate this, Lorelai. I mean it, I couldn't be more grateful."
"LORELAI: Hold on."
"EMILY: Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I wanna get a tape recorder. I want that last thing on tape."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Just remember what you said."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[The band is setting up for the prayer meeting]"
"MRS. KIM: You have everything you need  water, extension cords?"
"DAVE: Yes, ma'am, I think we're good."
"MRS. KIM: Where's your tambourine?"
"DAVE: We don't have one."
"MRS. KIM: Next time bring one."
"[doorbell rings]"
"ZACH: Dude, remember the drill instructor in Full Metal Jacket?"
"BRIAN: Totally."
"[Mrs. Kim answers the door]"
"YOUNG CHUI: Good evening."
"MRS. KIM: Ah, Young Chui, come in. Lane, look, Young Chui is here."
"LANE: Hi."
"YOUNG CHUI: Hi. These are for you. [hands her a bouquet of flowers]"
"LANE: Thank you, they're beautiful. Isn't that nice of him, Mama?"
"MRS. KIM: Yes, very thoughtful. Stand together now. Don't smile. [takes picture] Very nice. That one's for the grandchildren."
"LANE: Well, we better go. We don't wanna be late for the game."
"MRS. KIM: I will put these in a vase for you for your bedside table. Now, go have fun."
"LANE: We'll be home by nine."
"MRS. KIM: Ah, yes, whatever. Go, go."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is near the front desk as Sookie walks over with a box]"
"SOOKIE: Oh, thank goodness you haven't left."
"LORELAI: Why, what's up?"
"SOOKIE: Emily called and asked if you can bring some serving dishes. Apparently, hers are tacky."
"LORELAI: My, Gran is a relentless old broad, isn't she?"
"SOOKIE: You want them where?"
"LORELAI: Just on the counter's fine. Thanks, hon."
"[Lorelai calls home]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: What are you doing there?"
"RORY: What do you mean, what am I doing here? I live here, remember? Who were you expecting to find?"
"LORELAI: No one. I was calling to check messages and see if Mom called."
"RORY: Well, she hasn't. No one has. In fact, this is the first time the phone's rung all day."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"RORY: What, ah?"
"LORELAI: Okay, get out."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Out of the house, get out of the house."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Why? Look at the clock, what does it say?"
"RORY: It says six."
"LORELAI: So, it is six on a Saturday night, which means you have now spent a day and a night waiting for him to call."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: Well, that's not good, kid. Look, let's say he does call. You can't be the kind of girl that gets all mad in her head and then forgets everything once he deigns to show up, right?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Okay, so don't just sit there waiting. Go out, do something."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. What's Lane doing tonight?"
"RORY: She's going to the hockey game with her fake boyfriend."
"LORELAI: Perfect."
"RORY: Perfect? It's a hockey game."
"LORELAI: It'll be fun. There'll be cheerleaders and clowns, people doing the wave."
"RORY: You have no idea what a hockey game is, do you?"
"LORELAI: It doesn't matter. Put on a jacket and get outta there, and if he calls . . ."
"RORY: Who cares!"
"LORELAI: That's my girl."
"RORY: Thanks, Mom."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily walks into the house carrying several bags. From the hallway, she sees Trix in the living room kissing a man. Emily quietly walks back outside.]"
"EMILY: Oh my."
""
""
""
"CUT TO HOCKEY RINK"
"[The game is about to start. Miss Patty and Babette stand in the center of the rink singing the National Anthem.]"
"BABETTE/MISS PATTY: [singing] . . .And the rockets red glare, the b*mb bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."
"[Rory walks over to Lane in the stands]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LANE: Rory."
"RORY: It's cold in here."
"LANE: It's the ice."
"RORY: Oh my God, there really is ice. Cool."
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"RORY: I'm hockeying."
"LANE: That's not a word."
"RORY: Where is everybody?"
"LANE: There was a monster truck show in Woodbury tonight, pulls a lot of the same demographic. Sit. Where's Jess?"
"RORY: Don't know, don't care."
"LANE: Really?"
"RORY: I'm a free woman tonight."
"LANE: Is everything okay?"
"RORY: Everything's fine."
"LANE: You sure?"
"RORY: Absolutely. I just wanted to see some good hockey playing."
"LANE: Uh huh."
"RORY: Really. Is that Young Chui?"
"LANE: You mean the guy with the cell phone stapled to his ear  yeah, that's him."
"RORY: He looks kind of serious."
"LANE: He's talking to Karen."
"RORY: His real girlfriend?"
"LANE: I think she's not quite as cool as Dave is about the whole fake dating thing. She needs reassurance."
"RORY: Well, Dave is pretty cool."
"LANE: The coolest, isn't it? I mean, besides Jess."
"RORY: Right."
"LANE: Right."
"KIRK: People of Stars Hollow, are you ready to rumble? Then let's get it on."
"[the referee drops the puck to start the game]"
"KIRK: And the puck is down as the first quarter begins. Period, sorry. First period begins, my bad."
"RORY: So, this is sports."
"CUT TO KIM RESIDENCE"
"[The band is playing at the prayer meeting]"
"ZACH: [singing] I once was lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I see."
"WHOLE BAND: [singing] Amen."
"MRS. KIM: Very nice. You may now take a fifteen-minute break while we finish our tea. Also, good time to retune."
"BRIAN: Was she looking at me?"
"ZACH: She wasn't looking at me, dude."
"DAVE: Hey, I'm gonna, uh, go outside and get some air, okay?"
"ZACH: Uh, sure."
"DAVE: Okay, be right back."
"[Dave walks out onto the porch, checks his watch, then starts running down the street]"
"CUT TO HOCKEY GAME"
"[Rory and Lane are in line at the snack stand.]"
"LANE: [on cell phone] Believe me, I am not interested in Young Chui in that way. He's cute and all, but I've got a guy. No, no, when I say he's cute, I just mean he's your boyfriend and you've got good taste, that's all. Hey, Koreans do not have problems! [hands phone to Young Chui] You talk to her, I'm done."
"YOUNG CHUI: [on phone] Karen? [walks away]"
"RORY: That went well."
"LINDSAY: Oh."
"RORY: Hey Lindsay, how are you?"
"LANE: Hi Lindsay."
"LINDSAY: Hi. I'm good, thanks. Um, how are you?"
"RORY: Good. You know, just enjoying my first hockey game. It seems there's a lot of bashing of people into walls, which is always good fun in my book."
"LINDSAY: Oh, absolutely. I'm all for more bashing."
"RORY: You know, I don't think we've seen each other since I left Stars Hollow High. What have you been up to?"
"LINDSAY: Oh, you know, nothing really. The usual, school."
"RORY: Right, sure."
"LANE: School. Me too, but you know that since we go to school together."
"LINDSAY: Well, I should be getting back. Um, it was good seeing you again."
"RORY: You, too."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Lindsay walks away]"
"RORY: Okay, so that was weird, right?"
"LANE: Oh, yeah, really weird."
"RORY: But I didn't do anything, did I?"
"LANE: You mean like ask her how she was? Yeah, you probably made an enemy for life."
"RORY: Maybe she's angry because I didn't keep in touch after I left, but we weren't that good of friends."
"LANE: Maybe, or it could be that Chilton thing."
"RORY: What Chilton thing?"
"LANE: Well, you know how some people think because you went to Chilton, you're a snob and think you're better than everyone else."
"RORY: What? Who thinks that?"
"LANE: Well, you know, like uh, Julie Lersten, Kristin Keiffer, Jill Allen. Haven't we talked about this?"
"RORY: No."
"[Dave walks up behind them]"
"DAVE: Hey."
"LANE: Dave."
"DAVE: Hey Rory."
"RORY: Hey."
"DAVE: So, where's, uh, where's Young Chui?"
"LANE: Talking to Karen."
"DAVE: Who?"
"RORY: His girlfriend."
"DAVE: Oh, right. That's cool, okay. Well, how's the game?"
"LANE: The other team's winning."
"RORY: But our fans have the best insults. At least, Babette does."
"DAVE: Well, that's really what counts in the end."
"LANE: So, what are you doing here? Did you finish already?"
"DAVE: Oh, no. You're mom gave us a fifteen minute break. I just thought I'd swing by."
"LANE: But it's more than a mile away."
"DAVE: Yeah, I better get back. I'll see you later."
"LANE: Bye."
"[Dave leaves]"
"RORY: Well, well, well. If I didn't know better, I'd say someone isn't quite as cool as we thought he was."
"LANE: What do you mean? He's jealous. Oh my God, he's jealous, that's so great."
"RORY: You've worked your womanly wiles on him, Lane Kim."
"LANE: I've never made a guy jealous before. I feel so powerful."
"RORY: Just remember, there's cute jealous and there's Othello."
"LANE: Good point."
"RORY: So, who else thinks I'm a snob?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the front entryway as there's a knock at the door. She opens it.]"
"LORELAI: Jess."
"JESS: Hey, is Rory here?"
"LORELAI: Are you serious?"
"JESS: Yeah, I'm serious."
"LORELAI: No, I'm serious. Are you serious?"
"JESS: Why do you keep asking me if I'm serious?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm just trying to imagine the scenario here. You looked at the clock that said it was 7:30 on a Saturday night and you thought to yourself, ""Hey, Rory must be home."""
"JESS: Yes."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, are you serious?"
"JESS: Okay, I'm guessing that's your way of telling me she's not home."
"LORELAI: No, Jess, she's not home."
"JESS: Do you know where she is?"
"LORELAI: She's at the hockey game."
"JESS: Hey, look, you don't wanna tell me where she is, fine."
"LORELAI: Jess, she really is at the hockey game. You'd know that if you'd  what, ladies and gentlemen? That's right  bothered to call."
"JESS: Why are you hassling me?"
"LORELAI: Well, mostly because I'm here to hassle you. Now, if you'd bothered calling, maybe Rory would be here to hassle you."
"JESS: Hey, Rory knows I'm not the kind of guy who lives by a schedule."
"LORELAI: Yes, and look what the guy who doesn't live by a schedule ends up doing on a Saturday night  talking to his girlfriend's mother."
"JESS: Whatever."
"LORELAI: Hey, Jess. You like music, right? The Beach Boys said it best. None of the guys go steady cause it wouldn't be right to leave their best girls home on a Saturday night. Rory is one of the best girls. She's the best girl, if you want my opinion, and you don't seem to have the first idea as to how she should be treated."
"JESS: Well, luckily I've got you to tell me."
"LORELAI: Not anymore. You and I have discussed your relationship with Rory long enough."
"JESS: Fine."
"LORELAI: I'll tell her you stopped by."
"JESS: Don't bother. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Brian Hutchins is looking pretty good right about now."
"CUT TO HOCKEY GAME"
"[Rory and Lane are carrying their food back to their seats]"
"RORY: If I had known sports were so much about eating, I would've come to a lot more of these."
"LANE: I know. There's something deeply satisfying about watching other people exercise while eating junk food."
"KIRK: Ten minutes til the next period, ladies and gentlemen. That's what we call them in hockey  periods, not halves. Let's try to keep that straight. Also, the puck is never referred to as a ball, not according to the book. Again, my bad."
"[Rory and Lane see Dean and Lindsay kissing]"
"LANE: I guess it wasn't the Chilton thing after all."
"CUT TO LATER IN THE HOCKEY GAME"
"KIRK: Number twelve has it now. He's skating, he's skating. My bet is he's going to try to whack it into that net thingy, but that's conjecture at this point. Now it's going the other way and they're hitting it between them. Number seven has it. Now number three. Now seven. Three again. Seven. Ten's got it now."
"[Dean skates over to Kirk]"
"DEAN: Kirk, just to let you know, some of the guys  not me, you know  but some of the guys say they're gonna rip your head off if you don't shut up, okay?"
"KIRK: We'll be pausing for a short break."
"CROWD: [cheers] We've got spirit, yes we do! We've got spirit, how about you?"
"LANE: You sure you're okay?"
"RORY: Will you stop asking me that every five seconds? I'm fine. I mean, it had to happen sometime. I didn't expect him to just sit around pining for me. Okay, a little, but she's really nice, right?"
"LANE: This is all my fault."
"RORY: Lane."
"LANE: I let you down. I'm supposed to be your eyes and ears in that school, and here's the biggest piece of news all year and I had no idea."
"RORY: It's okay."
"LANE: No, it's not. This is an intelligence gaffe of monumental proportions. What was I doing that I didn't notice this?"
"RORY: Studying, taking classes."
"LANE: Well, no more."
"RORY: Lane, it's not a big deal, really. And now I know, so, case closed."
"LANE: You're sure?"
"RORY: Positive. Let's just enjoy the game."
"PLAYER: No way!"
"KIRK: Excuse me, will you tell me what happened? Excuse me, number fourteen? Number fourteen, could you come back here?"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings. The maid opens the door. Lorelai is standing there with the slide projector and the box of serving dishes]"
"LORELAI: Hi. Just came to drop off some things."
"MAID: Oh, I can take those."
"LORELAI: Oh, great, thanks. [hands them to her] Careful, it's heavy."
"MAID: Everyone's in the living room if you wanna go in."
"LORELAI: Uh, if I wanna go in, if I wanna go in. Well, you pose a very deep and philosophical question there, but I think I'll just "
"[Emily walks over]"
"EMILY: Lorelai. I thought I heard your voice."
"LORELAI: Yes, I brought the slide machine and the platters and the punch bowl."
"EMILY: Wonderful. Come in and meet everyone, won't you?"
"LORELAI: I was just gonna do that."
"[cut to the living room. Trix and her friends are looking at slides]"
"MRS. VAN WYCK: It's obscene."
"TRIX: It's Picasso."
"MRS. VAN WYCK: Then Picasso is obscene."
"TRIX: Oh, Isabelle."
"MRS. VAN WYCK: It has six breasts."
"TRIX: You cannot be sure if those are breasts. They could be canons. He was quite obsessed with the Spanish Civil w*r for awhile."
"EMILY: Ladies, look who's here."
"TRIX: Lorelai, wonderful. We all need a break for a moment. Come meet my friends. Emily, we were waiting for iced tea or am I imagining things?"
"EMILY: It's on its way, Mom."
"TRIX: So is death. Lorelai, this is Mrs. Van Wyck, Mrs. Deerborne, Mrs. Rutherman. This is my granddaughter, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Nice to meet you all."
"TRIX: Well, come, sit."
"LORELAI: Oh, I don't want to interrupt anything."
"TRIX: You're interrupting nothing but thirst, my dear. Now, talk to some old women, tell us what it's like to be young."
"LORELAI: Not nearly as much fun since the mandatory sunscreen rule, I'll tell ya."
"[the maid brings in a platter]"
"EMILY: Here we go, iced tea and sandwiches."
"TRIX: [picks up a glass] Too warm. Do you know that Lorelai's daughter is graduating from Chilton in June?"
"[Emily walks over to the drink cart to put ice in the glass]"
"EMILY: [sings] Love in the afternoon. . ."
"TRIX: She is an excellent student and may. . ."
"EMILY: La, la, la, la, la. . ."
"TRIX: Emily, what are you doing?"
"EMILY: I'm sorry?"
"TRIX: Why are you singing like that?"
"EMILY: Was I signing? I didn't realize. Here's your tea, Mom. I certainly hope it's cold enough."
"LORELAI: Um, I brought the slide projector over. Would you like me to set it up?"
"TRIX: That would be fine. We can start watching now since I do not anticipate dinner being served anywhere near the time I requested."
"EMILY: [sings] Our hearts are filled with joy. . ."
"TRIX: Emily you're doing it again."
"EMILY: I was?"
"TRIX: Yes, you were."
"EMILY: Huh. You know, it's because I caught some of ""Love in the Afternoon"" the other day, the movie. Have you seen it, Mom?"
"TRIX: I don't believe I have."
"EMILY: Oh, well, it's wonderful. And a wonderful concept, too, don't you think? Anyway, I must have the music stuck in my head. That must be why I'm singing it. I mean, what else could it be, hm?"
"LORELAI: Hey, Mom, how bout we go get some of that cheese you bought for the ladies, huh? I'll help you. Come on. We'll be right back."
"[Lorelai and Emily walk into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Okay, what is going on?"
"EMILY: I saw her kissing a man."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: When I came home today, I walked in and I saw her standing in the living room kissing a man."
"LORELAI: Gran?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: My Gran?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: My Gran was kissing a man?"
"EMILY: In a purple velour jogging suit."
"LORELAI: Gran was in a purple velour jogging suit?"
"EMILY: No, the man was wearing a purple jogging suit."
"LORELAI: And you're sure they were kissing?"
"EMILY: One hundred percent sure."
"LORELAI: My God. Was he hot?"
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know what you're supposed to ask when you hear your grandmother's been making out with a guy."
"EMILY: I don't know if he was hot. Your grandmother sucking face was blocking my view."
"LORELAI: What'd she do? Did she see you?"
"EMILY: No. After my heart started back up again, I went outside and hid in the bushes until he left."
"LORELAI: Okay, now I have two really good visuals fighting for top billing here."
"EMILY: Do you realize how wonderful this is?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I guess it's wonderful, Gran has a guy."
"EMILY: No, what's wonderful is after all these years of her abuse, her condescension, her insults and her degrading comments, after all these years of pure unadulterated hell, I finally have something to hold over her."
"LORELAI: Oh, Mom."
"EMILY: Finally, I have the upper hand. Finally, I have something to nail her with. Finally, that woman is going down."
"LORELAI: You cannot use this against Gran."
"EMILY: Yes, I can, I've earned it."
"LORELAI: Mom, I know Gran gives you a hard time, but she did not tell anyone about this guy for a reason."
"EMILY: Yes, because she's embarrassed. She should be. He was dressed like a bookie."
"LORELAI: You have to be above this."
"EMILY: No, I don't have to be above this."
"LORELAI: You're seriously telling me that you're gonna be the one to go out there and humiliate Gran in front of her friends, in front of her family. Just think about it, Mom. What would Miss Manners do?"
"EMILY: It's not fair."
"LORELAI: Gran will be back in her own house soon."
"EMILY: I know, you're right."
"LORELAI: Just hang on til then."
"EMILY: All right, let's go back in there and get this evening over with."
"LORELAI: You're a stand up lady, Emily Gilmore, you know that?"
"EMILY: Oh really? Well, that makes me feel so much better."
"[they walk back to the living room]"
"MRS. VAN WYCK: And is this normal, Richard, to be getting home from work so late?"
"RICHARD: Oh, that's one of the pitfalls of starting your own business, I'm afraid."
"TRIX: You should say, of starting a successful business, Richard."
"RICHARD: Successful so far, Trix. Let's not jinx it."
"TRIX: Though, perhaps if Emily could have the meal served on time, Richard would have more inducement to get home at a reasonable hour."
"EMILY: I saw her kissing a man in a track suit!"
"RICHARD: What?"
"TRIX: Emily!"
"CUT TO HOCKEY GAME"
"[The game is over. People are filing out of the stands]"
"KIRK: Well, ladies and gentlemen, much like the Israelites of Yore, the Stars Hollow Minutemen languished in the desert for forty years. But tonight, there was no Promised Land, no New Canaan, only a humiliating five to one defeat at the merciless hands of the West Hartford Wildcats. So it's back to the desert for the Minutemen, perhaps for another forty years. Of course, by then, I'll be seventy years old. A lot of the rest of you will probably be dead. Taylor, you'll be dead. Babette, Miss Patty. . .that man there in the hat."
"LANE: Hey, if we run, we might be able to catch the last few minutes of the band."
"RORY: Yeah, I don't think the pint of liquid cheese in my stomach is going to allow for much running."
"LANE: I'll call you tomorrow."
"RORY: Definitely. Have fun."
"YOUNG CHUI: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"DEAN: Hey."
"RORY: Dean. Hey, how are you? Oh, God, that's a stupid question to ask someone who just lost the regional semi-finals, isn't it? And now it sounds like I'm rubbing your face in it."
"DEAN: Don't worry about it. They were better than us, they deserved to win."
"RORY: And hey, at least you got a point. That's good, right? I mean, better than not getting any. Geez, I really suck at this post-sports talk."
"DEAN: Well, you haven't had much practice."
"RORY: True. But who knows, I might be a sports convert. I mean, the eating of massive amounts of junk food, and listening to Kirk make a fool of himself in front of a bunch of people  all things I enjoy."
"DEAN: In fact, you could almost get rid of the sports part of it."
"RORY: That's what I was going to say. So, I ran into Lindsay."
"DEAN: Yeah, I hadn't quite figured out how to tell you that."
"RORY: Well, I think it's great."
"DEAN: You do?"
"RORY: Absolutely. I mean, she's cute and smart and really nice."
"DEAN: I know."
"RORY: Like once, in fourth grade, we went on a field trip to Mark Twain's house, and I really wanted this refrigerator magnet in the shape of Mark Twain's head, but I didn't have any money, so she bought it for me, and she wouldn't even let me pay her back. Pretty classy for a fourth grader."
"DEAN: That sounds like Lindsay."
"RORY: Exactly. So, good job, mister."
"DEAN: Thanks. So, how are things with Jess?"
"RORY: Oh, good, good."
"DEAN: He's not with you?"
"RORY: No. This really isn't his kind of thing."
"DEAN: Yeah. Well, uh, I'd better go. I gotta change and then Lindsay and I are going out."
"RORY: Right. Sure. Have fun."
"[Dean leaves. Rory walks to a pay phone and calls Jess]"
"LUKE: [on answering machine] You've reached Luke Danes and Jess Mariano, leave a message."
"RORY: It's me. I just wanted to let you know that this is the last weekend I spend sitting around like an idiot hoping you'll call, okay? I'm not going to be that girl. From now on, I want a plan. I mean, a real plan with a time and a place, and I'm tired of hearing Let's hook up later.' What does that mean anyway? What's later? How do I set my watch to later? Later doesn't cut it anymore, got it? And, yeah, you know, maybe I am spoiled. But guess what? I like being spoiled. I plan to go on being spoiled. And if that doesn't sound like something that you can or want to do, then fine. I'm sure you'll find another girl who doesn't mind sitting around cleaning her keyboard on a Friday night hoping you'll call, but it's not going to be me. Oh, yeah, this is a message for Jess."
"[Rory walks outside and sees Jess leaning against his car]"
"JESS: Hey. Figured I'd find you here. I mean, you say the word hockey, you say the word Rory, right?"
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"JESS: Came to give you these."
"RORY: Earplugs. What are these for?"
"JESS: I got tickets to the Distillers."
"RORY: You did? For when?"
"JESS: For tonight."
"RORY: Tonight? But "
"JESS: I would've been here sooner, but I had to wait in line. So we should probably get going. I mean, we don't wanna miss anything, right?"
"RORY: Hey, Jess?"
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: When you get home, could you erase your answering machine without listening to any of the messages? That'd be great, thanks."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Trix is lying in bed. There's a knock at the door]"
"GRAN: Come in."
"[Emily walks in]"
"EMILY: I brought you some aspirin. It's the buffered kind that you like. Is there anything else that you need?"
"GRAN: No, thank you."
"EMILY: Mom, I want to apologize for what I said downstairs. I had no right to humiliate you like that, in front of your friends, in front of Richard. This relationship was something you had chosen to keep private and I should have respected that. I am truly sorry. He seemed like a very nice man. Why didn't you tell anyone about him?"
"GRAN: I married once, I married Richard's father. That was my husband. I have no desire to marry again and dishonor his memory."
"EMILY: I understand."
"GRAN: I believe a woman marries for life. If, after your husband is gone, you desperately desire some sort of permanent attachment, add an addition onto the house  a library or a solarium. I have a library and a solarium."
"EMILY: Yes, you do."
"GRAN: However, in spite of all this, I found myself getting lonely. And I don't care for being lonely, it's quite annoying. So many years ago, I met a man, and he became my companion. Tonight, both he and I were both publicly humiliated and our relationship altered forever. Can you imagine how that feels?"
"EMILY: Actually, I've had a little experience with being humiliated in front of the people I love, yes. Mom, please believe me, I know how important your pride is to you, and I never had any intention of robbing you of it. I feel terrible that I caused you any pain. I just wish that once in awhile, you might feel a little bit terrible that you cause me pain. I have pride, too, you know. And my husband travels and is very busy and I miss him and I'm lonely sometimes, just like you."
"GRAN: Well."
"CUT TO DOWNSTAIRS"
"[Lorelai and Richard are in the living room]"
"LORELAI: So that was quite a gathering."
"RICHARD: Yes, it was."
"LORELAI: It would make a great Christmas story. I mean, I know it didn't happen at Christmas, but it's the kind of thing that would happen at Christmas, so it's not like if you told someone it did happen at Christmas, they'd go, Really? Cause it doesn't sound like a Christmas story.' Thanksgiving would probably work also. Listen, Dad, I know you're a little upset with Mom right now, and I'm probably out of line in saying this, but you might wanna think about cutting her some slack. She's really missed you lately. I mean, you work so much and then you're helping Gran in your free time, which is totally understandable, but still, it's hard. As much as Gran likes you, she tends to be a littler rough on Mom, and I think Mom just kind of snapped. She'd never do anything like that intentionally. You do know that, Dad, right?"
"[Richard starts laughing]"
"LORELAI: Dad? Okay, apparently it's two-for-one flip out night at the Gilmore house."
"RICHARD: Do you really think he was wearing a track suit?"
"LORELAI: I don't. . ."
"RICHARD: Well, I wonder if he was wearing Nike's also."
"LORELAI: Just Do It takes on a whole new meaning, doesn't it?"
"RICHARD: I guess I've got a new daddy."
"LORELAI: Maybe he'll take you to ball games."
"RICHARD: Oh, we could get matching jogging suits. Oh, if only I could've seen Emily hiding in the bushes. It's like a play by Moliere."
"[Emily walks down the steps]"
"EMILY: What are you two cackling about?"
"RICHARD: Oh, nothing."
"LORELAI: Yeah, nothing."
"EMILY: Well, don't stop on my account. I'm just passing through."
"RICHARD: Where are you going?"
"EMILY: We're going to have tea."
"LORELAI: They're going to have tea?"
"RICHARD: That's a first."
"LORELAI: Maybe they're going to be pals now."
"RICHARD: I don't know how I feel about my mother and my wife being in cahoots."
"LORELAI: I don't know how I feel about you saying the word cahoots."
"RICHARD: Well, this alliance could make things very uncomfortable for me."
"[Emily walks past them with a tray of tea]"
"EMILY: Sending a maid down to tell me how to make tea, as if I don't know after all these years. Guess she'll have a coronary if the water hits the cup one second before the bag."
"LORELAI: I think you're safe."
"RICHARD: I think so, too."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is eating at the kitchen table when Rory comes home]"
"LORELAI: Hey, how was the game?"
"RORY: Fun, we got clobbered."
"LORELAI: Oh. If you'd won, you could've rioted through town trashing storefronts and torching police cars like they do in L.A."
"RORY: Maybe next year."
"LORELAI: What'd you do after?"
"RORY: Oh, you know, just hung out."
"LORELAI: With Lane and her fake boyfriend?"
"RORY: Uh huh. I thought you were eating at Grandma's."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, and there's a story behind that."
"RORY: Can it wait til tomorrow? I'm really exhausted."
"LORELAI: It's a good story."
"RORY: I'm sure. I just won't be able to fully appreciate it in my weakened state. And this gives you extra time to practice your voices."
"LORELAI: Fine, fine. Let me just say two words  jogging suit."
"RORY: Jogging suit."
"LORELAI: See, you're hooked."
"RORY: Yeah, well, now I'm definitely waking up tomorrow."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are both reading in the living room. Lorelai glances out the window]"
"LORELAI: Mail!"
"RORY: Mail!"
"LORELAI: Hurry up! Where are your shoes?"
"RORY: I'll get them later."
"LORELAI: No, get them now."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: Why? Because if your Harvard acceptance letter is in that batch of mail and you do not have shoes on, we can't run off immediately and celebrate. All of our happiness will be on hold until you come back inside and put on your shoes. Is that what you want to put a hold on happiness?"
"RORY: What's the difference if we wait then or we wait now?"
"LORELAI: Because we are not happy now."
"RORY: Right, okay. [runs to her bedroom]"
"LORELAI: No laces, just get them on your feet."
"RORY: [runs back with shoes on] Let's go!"
"[they run outside to the mailbox. Kirk is going through his mailbag]"
"LORELAI: Kirk!"
"RORY: Kirk!"
"KIRK: Good morning, ladies."
"LORELAI: Is there an envelope in there?"
"RORY: A big envelope, not a little envelope."
"LORELAI: Yeah, a big envelope means she's in, a little envelope means she needs to marry rich."
"KIRK: Just one second, please."
"RORY: Aren't you supposed to go through the mail before you get here?"
"KIRK: Some work that way. Personally, I think it takes the spontaneity out of the job."
"LORELAI: Need some help?"
"KIRK: Sorry, federal law prohibits it."
"RORY: Any chance you could go faster?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, you got a girl's future in that sack of yours, Santa."
"RORY: Thank you for adding the Santa."
"LORELAI: Any time."
"KIRK: You know what I've noticed?"
"LORELAI: It wouldn't be any mail in there with our names on it, would it?"
"KIRK: I've noticed people don't slow down anymore."
"RORY: Guess I've got time to tie my shoes."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, cobble yourself a new pair Daniel Day Lewis."
"KIRK: No one stops to smell a nice flower or look at a puppy."
"LORELAI: You're absolutely right."
"[Kirk pulls a large envelope out of his mailbag]"
"KIRK: No one stops to ask how you're doing. . .is your family well, did you see that game last night?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, people suck. Is that ours?"
"KIRK: What? Oh. [checks envelope] Mrs. Rita Flora. Nope."
"RORY: Rats."
"LORELAI: It could still be in there."
"KIRK: Rita Flora  didn't she die?"
"LORELAI: While you were delivering her mail?"
"KIRK: She did die. She died last week."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: They're supposed to put your mail on hold when you die."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's go back inside."
"RORY: What about the envelope?"
"LORELAI: We'll check back on our way to Luke's. . .for dinner."
"KIRK: [pulls out another envelope] Hey, one for Kirk."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai, Rory and Lane are sitting at a table. Lane is tapping her drumsticks on a jar]"
"LANE: It's getting frustrating. I mean, there's so many great songs that have been written post-Cobain, but try and convince Zach of that. I mean, he's impossible, stubborn, and just a tad intellectually challenged, in case you haven't noticed."
"LORELAI: Lane, honey?"
"LANE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Just, could you, with the sticks there, I can't. . ."
"LANE: Oh, sorry. Nervous habit."
"RORY: Mom's a little crabby this morning."
"LORELAI: I'm not crabby, I'm very, very ill."
"RORY: With allergies."
"LORELAI: Deadly allergies."
"RORY: Sorry, didn't mean to minimize your condition. Should we make funeral arrangements now?"
"LORELAI: Yes. [pulls some medicine out of her purse] But make sure you can get your money back in case this stuff works."
"RORY: Where did you get those?"
"LORELAI: Found them in your room."
"RORY: These expired in 98."
"LORELAI: So, what, I should take four?"
"RORY: Yes, that's exactly my point."
"[Luke walks over and sets some menus on the table]"
"LUKE: Here."
"RORY: New menus."
"LANE: Very fancy."
"LORELAI: Why'd you get new menus?"
"LUKE: It was time."
"LORELAI: But I had made little doodles with my name hidden in them on each one of the old ones just like Hirschfeld."
"LUKE: Sorry."
"LORELAI: It took me years to hit every menu. And these have super heavy plastic over them. How am I gonna doodle?"
"LUKE: Has it ever occurred to you that the super heavy plastic is there to discourage the doodling?"
"RORY: Hey, this looks different."
"LUKE: It's not different."
"LANE: It's totally different."
"LUKE: It's not that different."
"LORELAI: There are more salads."
"RORY: Three more salads."
"LORELAI: Three more salads  who needs three more salads?"
"RORY: One was enough."
"LUKE: Well, Nicole said "
"LORELAI: Nicole said."
"LUKE: There wasn't really that much for her to eat on the menu, so I just. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, you added three more salads just for Nicole. When I asked you to add chili-topped Pringles, you said no."
"LUKE: And I stand by that."
"LORELAI: How come Nicole gets three salads and I still get a no?"
"RORY: Because Nicole is his girlfriend."
"LUKE: Nicole is not my girlfriend, Nicole is the woman that I am dating, that's it."
"LORELAI: So what happens when you guys get serious, the whole place goes soy?"
"LUKE: Just order, please."
"LANE: Did you take off the Monte Cristo sandwich?"
"LUKE: Well, I "
"RORY: No!"
"LORELAI: You did, you took off the Monte Cristo sandwich."
"LUKE: I omitted a few obsolete dishes."
"LORELAI: I can't believe Nicole made you take off the Monte Cristo. She's got you menu-whipped."
"LUKE: She does not have me menu-whipped. I took off a disgusting ridiculous sandwich that no one has ever ordered, including the three of you."
"RORY: But just having it there made us feel like we always could."
"LORELAI: It was comforting."
"RORY: Like soup."
"LORELAI: Exactly. It was comforting like deep-fried ham and cheese soup."
"RORY: And even though I never ordered it, I talked about ordering it, haven't I?"
"LANE: On several occasions."
"LORELAI: So you've not only eliminated a sandwich, you've eliminated a conversation piece."
"RORY: Now what will we talk about?"
"LUKE: Fine."
"[Luke walks to the counter and returns with some old menus]"
"LUKE: Here. Old menus, everything's there. Knock yourselves out."
"LORELAI: How come everybody else gets a new menu? [Luke walks away] I feel much better now."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"[A teacher is passing back papers]"
"TEACHER: Well, I must say I'm glad to see that simply because the SATs are over, most of you are still taking your classwork seriously. Most of you."
"LOUISE: Michael Mason. Worth every wrong answer."
"TEACHER: All right, before we continue, I would like to remind you that the Chilton Bicentennial celebration takes place next week."
"LOUISE: Number four. [shows off her hickey]"
"MADELINE: Well done."
"TEACHER: The official sign up sheet for the speech contest has gone up in the back of the room. The contest will be held on Friday, and the winner will present their speech at the ceremony next week. Now, some of you may be saying to yourself, Hey, I already turned in my college application. Why should I spend all this time entering a speech competition, which if I win means I have to give up a Friday night, when I can't even use it for my resume? What's in it for me?'"
"MADELINE: Wow, that was spooky."
"TEACHER: Yes, the speech will not go on your record. However, the bicentennial is going to be quite a prestigious affair. Past alumni and faculty will be there, some of these people are now professors at the same schools you're planning an attending. Plus, C-SPAN will be broadcasting the event live. All in all, it's shaping up to be a very exciting event. Think about it. [bell rings] Oh, I almost forgot to welcome back Brad Langford. He returns to us fresh from Broadway where he's just completed a successful run of Into the Woods. Welcome back, Brad."
"BRAD: Thank you. It's good to be back."
"PARIS: Sit down, Mary Martin."
"TEACHER: All right everyone, have a lovely rest of the day. I will see you tomorrow."
"[the students start to leave. Brad walks up to Rory]"
"BRAD: Rory, hi."
"RORY: Hey Brad, good to have you back. How was Broadway?"
"BRAD: It was great, but Nathan Lane is a very bitter man."
"RORY: I've heard that."
"BRAD: You know, I tell you, even more than the actual experience of performing live, the confidence it gives you in every aspect of your life, that's the most amazing thing."
"RORY: Well, you do look rather confident."
"BRAD: Hey, it's the new me."
"[Madeline and Louise walk over]"
"LOUISE: So, Brad. . .Broadway, I must know."
"BRAD: Yes?"
"LOUISE: Did you get to keep your makeup?"
"MADELINE: What about your costumes, cause that seems great."
"LOUISE: Ooh, unless you're doing Les Mis."
"MADELINE: Or Cats."
"LOUISE: Furry spandex with a tail and jazz shoes?"
"MADELINE: Hurrah. So, do you?"
"BRAD: Do I?"
"MADELINE: Get to keep the makeup?"
"BRAD: I didn't ask."
"LOUISE: You didn't ask?"
"MADELINE: How do you leave the house every morning and not have a piano fall on your head?"
"BRAD: Well, I make a left on Federal and then "
"RORY: Brad, that really didn't require an answer."
"[Paris walks over]"
"PARIS: You're blocking the list."
"RORY: What's that? Will we please move so you may sign up for the speech contest? Why, yes, Paris, we'd be happy to. How kind of you to phrase it in that very respectful manner."
"PARIS: Are you going to move, or do you need a five, six, seven, eight?"
"BRAD: Paris, this time on stage has been a very growing experience for me. I'm no longer intimidated by you or people like you."
"PARIS: I'm thrilled to hear it, Chita Rivera. Move. Well, Gilmore, I certainly hope you're signing up, too. It'll be my last chance to trounce you with anything at this school."
"RORY: My decision to do this will in no way depend on you, Paris."
"PARIS: I'm only saying it won't be a totally satisfying victory just b*at Jerome Robbins and the rest of the losers here. I'd really like to take you down also."
"BRAD: Boy, she is really up on her theater references."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie, surrounded by her kitchen staff, has several plates of food on the counter in front of her]"
"SOOKIE: This is outrageous. I am beyond offended. Did you tell them I'm beyond offended? Sending my food back? That's it, get their names, they're never eating here again."
"WAITER: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Wait, what wine was he drinking?"
"WAITER: 1952 Chateau Petrus Bordeaux."
"SOOKIE: Hm. Okay, never mind."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, is everything okay?"
"SOOKIE: No, we have got to have a better screening system for customers here."
"LORELAI: Yes, we do, since we currently have no screening system for customers here."
"SOOKIE: They sent it back. My food. My four star, you haven't lived til you've eaten there, says Ruth Reichl,' food."
"LORELAI: What did they say was wrong?"
"SOOKIE: You name it. Too salty, too hot, too sewer-y."
"LORELAI: Honey, calm down. Some people are just stupid."
"SOOKIE: Yes, they are stupid, and stupid people have stupid friends, and they all have to come here and be stupid together."
"LORELAI: Okay, now, don't be mad at me, but I have to ask this  are you sure there's nothing wrong with the food?"
"SOOKIE: Of course there's nothing wrong with the food. You don't think that I would know if something was wrong with my food? You don't think that I tasted every last dish that was sent back. I tasted it, Manuel tasted it, Rico tasted it, Louella tasted it. We all tasted it and it tastes fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. Do you mind?"
"SOOKIE: You don't believe me?"
"LORELAI: I believe you completely, but it's easier for me to take on those who doubt you if I actually tasted it myself."
"SOOKIE: Fine, go ahead."
"[Lorelai tries the food]"
"LORELAI: Okay, now I get the sewer-y reference."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: Come here. [to waiter] Just, uh, send them out some free desserts."
"SOOKIE: Free desserts? You're giving the stupid people free desserts."
"LORELAI: Sookie, I love you."
"SOOKIE: I love you, too."
"LORELAI: Okay, and I love your food, you know that."
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: But I have to tell you that that bite I just had over there is one of the worst things I've ever tasted, and I've tasted some very bad things."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Are you sure you didn't just accidentally drop something in the food tonight, like, I don't know, uh, strychnine or manure?"
"SOOKIE: No, I tested each dish every step of the way. I mean, the base, the stock, the sauce, the seasonings."
"LORELAI: Are you sick? Cause sometimes the flu or a cold or even allergies can throw your tastebuds off."
"SOOKIE: No, I'm not sick. I mean, I had a little bug last week, but nothing today."
"LORELAI: Well, I think you should think about getting a checkup. Maybe it was more than a little bug."
"SOOKIE: The food was really bad?"
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, it was just. . .well, yeah, it was really that bad."
"SOOKIE: I don't understand it."
"LORELAI: Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. Just have Manuel help you with the tasting for the rest of the night, okay?"
"[Rory walks into the kitchen]"
"RORY: Paris is going to drive me completely insane. Ooh, that looks good."
"ENTIRE KITCHEN STAFF: No!"
"RORY: Geez."
"LORELAI: Be happy you're loved, hon. I got a Kit Kat in my purse."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into the lobby]"
"RORY: What's up?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It's weird, Sookie must be sick or something."
"RORY: Sookie never gets sick."
"LORELAI: She'll be fine. So, tell me, what did Paris do now?"
"RORY: It's nothing, it's just Paris. There's this speech contest for the bicentennial, and I wasn't even going to enter it, but I don't know  with the whole it's my last chance to crush you before graduation' comment, I want to enter, I want to win, and I wanna dance around her saying I win, I win, I win!'"
"LORELAI: Wow, you're getting more and more like me everyday."
"RORY: But I know, it was petty and stupid and I should probably just ignore her."
"LORELAI: Yes, that is what you should do."
"RORY: Okay, that is what I will do."
"LORELAI: How come you weren't gonna enter the contest?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You love doing school things."
"RORY: I don't love doing school things when it involves the entire school staring at me while I'm doing them."
"LORELAI: You had to give your vice presidential acceptance speech in front of the entire school."
"RORY: Yeah, but I had to do that."
"LORELAI: Oh, so you're just gonna go through life only doing what you have to do."
"RORY: Well, no."
"LORELAI: Because a person who wants to be a foreign correspondent for a living should probably embrace the opportunity to practice her speechin' k*ll in front of a crowd."
"RORY: You had the motherly edge going there until you threw in the speechin' k*ll comment."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, you know what I mean."
"RORY: I know what you mean. Okay, I'll go out for the speech."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: And if I get to do the I win, I win, I win' dance, then so much the better."
"LORELAI: For everyone involved."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"LORELAI: Oh my God. Oh my God."
"[Lorelai walks across the lobby. Sookie is walking toward her]"
"LORELAI: You're pregnant!"
"SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!"
"[they scream and jump up and down]"
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, I'm pregnant!"
"RORY: You're pregnant?"
"SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!"
"LORELAI: That's why!"
"SOOKIE: I'm pregnant!"
"RORY: That's great!"
"[they all scream and hug]"
"CUT TO CHILTON HALLWAY"
"[Students are outside a classroom awaiting their turns in the speech contest. Paris walks up to a girl and looks at her speech]"
"PARIS: Huh."
"GIRL: What?"
"PARIS: That just looks like more than four thousand words, but I'm sure you counted them."
"GIRL: I did."
"PARIS: Good. [to another girl] Hey Shelly, good luck. Although I'm sure you're going to be great. After all, there's hardly anything on stage for you to trip over this time, right? [sits down next to Brad; sings] I've got my beans at Grandma's house, my magic beans at Grandma's house."
"BRAD: Stop it."
"PARIS: [sings] I'll take my beans, my magic beans, who's got the beans, we need some beans, I love the beans."
"BRAD: You can't rattle me."
"PARIS: [sings] Into the woods at Grandma's house."
"BRAD: Look, I'm proud of my part, okay? The New York Times called me winningly naïve."
"PARIS: [sings] Into the woods, into the woods, into the woods."
"RORY: Stop it right now."
"PARIS: I know, that is one annoying song."
"RORY: Leave Brad alone, and stop terrorizing everyone in this hallway."
"PARIS: Terrorizing? What are you talking about, terrorizing? I'm simply talking to my fellow classmates."
"RORY: You're trying to scare them into doing badly so you'll win easier."
"PARIS: I am not."
"RORY: Oh really? And that magical bean recital back there?"
"PARIS: Hey, I was trying to give the kid some human contact. He's been talking to nothing but a cow for a year and a half."
"BRAD: There was a person inside that cow, I've told you that!"
"TEACHER: [walks out of classroom] Brad Langford."
"BRAD: I'm winningly naïve."
"TEACHER: Okay."
"PARIS: Brad, you got your beans?"
"RORY: Stop. Go Brad, you'll do great."
"[Brad walks into the classroom]"
"RORY: It's amazing how you manage to hide those bolts on the side of your neck. What is that, just really good cover up?"
"PARIS: Rory, lower your voice. People are trying to concentrate."
"RORY: Wow."
"PARIS: Wow what?"
"RORY: Your speech must really suck."
"PARIS: Excuse me?"
"RORY: I mean, if you're going to all this trouble to psych out everyone else, then you must know you have a loser there."
"PARIS: Mind games. Not your forte, cupcake. Stick to talking to losers off the train tracks, will you?"
"RORY: You're horrible."
"PARIS: And I'm going to win. [a girl sits next to her] Cherry, hi. Man those braces are shiny."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai walks out of the house toward the Jeep; her cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello"
"SOOKIE: It's me."
"LORELAI: Every detail, leave nothing out."
"SOOKIE: Well, I told him."
"LORELAI: Did he flip? Did he cry? Did he scream?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: No? Did he hear you?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, he heard me."
"LORELAI: I don't understand, what happened?"
"SOOKIE: Well, I came home and I got some flowers and I chilled some glasses and I put some music on and I opened a bottle of champagne, and the cork broke the window so I had to clean up the glass, and then I taped some cardboard over the hole, and then I knocked over the bottle of champagne, so I had to get out the mop."
"LORELAI: My finger's hitting the fast forward button, hon."
"SOOKIE: So, he came home and I handed him a beer, and I smiled and I kissed him and I told him he was gonna be a daddy."
"LORELAI: And then he did what?"
"SOOKIE: Then he got out the calculator."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: He's been crunching numbers for two hours."
"LORELAI: He didn't say anything?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: Mr. I-want-four-in-four' hears he can check off number one and he says nothing?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, not nothing."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"SOOKIE: Every fifteen minutes, he says, Oh, boy.'"
"LORELAI: Oh, boy' like Oh, boy!'?"
"SOOKIE: No, Oh, boy' like Oh, boy.'"
"JACKSON: [in background] Oh, boy."
"SOOKIE: Did you hear that?"
"LORELAI: Well, maybe he's in shock."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy."
"SOOKIE: Maybe."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: Honey, I'd go in there and take that calculator away from him if I were you."
"SOOKIE: This wasn't how it was supposed to go."
"LORELAI: I know, sweetie, but give it time. It's a big thing."
"SOOKIE: He said he wanted this."
"LORELAI: He loves you, he wants this."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy."
"SOOKIE: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: Hang in there, I'll call you later."
"SOOKIE: I'll be here."
"JACKSON: Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy."
"CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET"
"[Several people are standing around Kirk, who has the mail spread out in a pile on the floor.]"
"DEAN: It's right there!"
"KIRK: Just a second."
"DEAN: I see it. Can I just "
"KIRK: Yeah, I can do it."
"DEAN: Kirk, it's right there!"
"KIRK: You are yelling at me, and I have to tell you that that is not the way to get results."
"DEAN: You keep passing it."
"KIRK: You are making me crazy."
"[Lorelai walks up to them]"
"LORELAI: Dean, I just need. . .oh, hey, that's my water bill."
"DEAN: He's been down there for twenty minutes."
"LORELAI: Kirk, you have to sort the mail first."
"KIRK: Everybody is always telling me what to do. Everybody else is always right. Well, I'm sorry, but I am the mail carrier in this town and I will carry the mail the way that I carry the mail, and if you don't like that, then you can carry the mail. But you'll have to apply for the job first and get hired. And there's a test, and it is a hard test, my friend. Ow, paper cut."
"LORELAI: Dean, I need some of that non-drowsy allergy medicine stuff."
"DEAN: Did you check in the back with the aspirin?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, nothing."
"DEAN: Then we're probably out. I could tell you when they're expected in, but I haven't gotten the mail yet."
"KIRK: Shut up."
"LORELAI: Okay, nevermind, I'll just grab some when I get to Hartford. See if you can get my water bill for me."
"DEAN: All right, I'll do my best. [to Kirk] I'm giving you five minutes to get up, then I'm getting the mop."
"KIRK: You will not touch this. This is the property of the United States Government."
"CUT TO HARTFORD DRUGSTORE"
"[Lorelai walks to the allergy medicine aisle and looks at the selection]"
"LORELAI: Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, show me a difference, people. Why can't I pick one? Ooh, on sale, that's it, good, done."
"[Lorelai picks a medicine, then walks to the end of the aisle, where she sees Max]"
"LORELAI: Max."
"MAX: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MAX: Hi back."
"LORELAI: I didn't know you had a cold."
"MAX: I just recently found out myself."
"LORELAI: Well, wow. You. Hi. How have you been?"
"MAX: I've been good."
"LORELAI: Good."
"MAX: I've been in California."
"LORELAI: Well, cowabunga dude."
"MAX: Yes, that's my official California name."
"LORELAI: So, California, huh?"
"MAX: Stanford, actually. I was teaching a class there."
"LORELAI: Well, good. It's about time that dump got some decent teachers."
"MAX: Yes, they're really trying to turn the place around."
"LORELAI: Well, so, if you were living in California, then what are you doing back here?"
"MAX: Well, this place has the best selection."
"LORELAI: In Hartford."
"MAX: My class ended, and I thought I'd come back for the Chilton Bicentennial."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"MAX: What are you doing here in Hartford?"
"LORELAI: Friday night?"
"MAX: The infamous Gilmore dinners."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"MAX: How's that going?"
"LORELAI: Uh, great. We had to add on an extra room for all the emotional baggage, but other than that, there's been no bloodshed as of yet."
"MAX: Well, I'm glad to hear it. And Rory's good?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, she's the Encyclopedia Britannica definition of good."
"MAX: Grades?"
"LORELAI: Perfect."
"MAX: Same boyfriend?"
"LORELAI: Different boyfriend."
"MAX: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"MAX: You hate him."
"LORELAI: No, I don't."
"MAX: You really hate him."
"LORELAI: I smile, I say hi, I let him eat the good cookies."
"MAX: You wanna have him k*ll."
"LORELAI: Only if I get a really good price."
"MAX: She's young, she'll move on, she's got college next year."
"LORELAI: Great. Frat boys, I cannot wait."
"MAX: Just get a keg, keeps them distracted."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, thanks for the advice. I'm gonna lock her up in a tower when I get home."
"MAX: Glad I could help. Well, listen, I, um, have this dinner I have to get to."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, yeah. Me, too. Me, too. So. . ."
"MAX: It was nice to see you."
"LORELAI: It was nice to see you, too."
"MAX: Bye."
"LORELAI: Uh, bye."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai rings the doorbell, Richard answers the door]"
"RICHARD: Ah, you're here."
"LORELAI: And you are by far the most masculine-looking maid my parents have ever had."
"RICHARD: It's chaos here. The second maid called in sick, the first is busy with dinner, and your poor mother is at the hospital. Her DAR group suffered a surfeit of strokes this week."
"LORELAI: Come again?"
"RICHARD: Three of her friends had strokes. And now she is hopping from sick bed to sick bed offering whatever comfort she can."
"[they start walking to the living room]"
"LORELAI: Three DAR strokes. What's in that water they're drinking?"
"RICHARD: Well, a little whiskey, usually. Oh, and you're forgetting Liesl."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: Our East-German maid. She was much more masculine-looking than me."
"LORELAI: Right, the muttonchops."
"RICHARD: Here is Rory."
"LORELAI: Thanks, I wouldn't have recognized her. Hi hon."
"RORY: Hi. Did you hear about the strokes?"
"LORELAI: Yes, stay away from whiskey and the DAR."
"RICHARD: Your mother would make you throw that out at this point."
"LORELAI: How about I exchange it for a martini?"
"RICHARD: Ah, coming up. [phone rings] Oh, good I'm expecting an important call. This could be it."
"LORELAI: Uh, Dad, if the maid is busy with dinner and the second one's out and Mom's at the hospital. . . you know."
"RICHARD: Oh, right, right. I'll get it! [leaves room]"
"LORELAI: Alone at last. Have I got something to tell you."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Or maybe you have something to tell me."
"RORY: Don't do that, I have nothing."
"LORELAI: Or are you minimizing what you know? Maybe you should maximize it."
"RORY: I'm confused."
"LORELAI: Maximize it."
"RORY: I'm maximum confused."
"LORELAI: I ran into Max."
"RORY: Medina?"
"LORELAI: At the pharmacy. Did you know he was back?"
"RORY: No. He was, like, on loan somewhere."
"LORELAI: Yeah, at Stanford. But he's back now, for a little while at least, and I am happy to report that either he's forgiven me for treating him so badly or it wasn't that bad and I just built it up worse in my head."
"RORY: Oh no, you treated him like crap"
"LORELAI: Well, he was very big about it. He didn't recoil or blow me off. We had a nice chat. It was good to see him."
"RORY: He's a great guy."
"LORELAI: He is."
"RORY: And a great teacher, too. I'm glad he's back."
"LORELAI: Good. He seems glad, too."
"[Richard returns to the room]"
"RICHARD: That was not my call, and for a second there, I thought a fourth friend of your mother's had had a stroke."
"RORY: Oh, no."
"RICHARD: But then I realized that it was one of the original stroke ladies' husband's calling to inform me of her stroke, which we already knew about, so here we are."
"LORELAI: Thank God."
"RICHARD: So, Rory has been telling me about the Chilton Bicentennial and her speech."
"RORY: Well, it's not my speech yet. I have to qualify for it."
"RICHARD: Oh, you'll get it."
"LORELAI: She'll be on C-SPAN if she does."
"RICHARD: Very good."
"RORY: It's not like anyone would watch it."
"LORELAI: Yes, they will. You're a hell of a lot more interesting than that usual sh*t they have of all the white men walking around that big empty chamber with the numbers all over them."
"RICHARD: That's a televised house vote, and I find that fascinating."
"LORELAI: It's like watching the Men's Warehouse security camera."
"RICHARD: When is your speech? I'd like to be there."
"RORY: Again, it's not my speech yet, but it's Friday at five."
"RICHARD: Oh, well, that's tough. Could they move it to six?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"RICHARD: Well, maybe I'll move my thing."
"RORY: That might be best."
"[phone rings]"
"RICHARD: Oh, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it!"
"[As Richard rushes out of the room, Lorelai laughs]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: [holds up her cell phone] Speed dial. I just like seeing him do that."
"RICHARD: [from other room] I've got it."

"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks up to the house, Sookie is sitting on the front porch swing]"
"SOOKIE: Ah, thank God, someone sane. Come on up."
"LORELAI: Your phone has been busy all night and I am dying to know what the doctor said."
"SOOKIE: He said, ""Congratulations, it's an It!"""
"LORELAI: Ah, I loved being pregnant."
"SOOKIE: You'll give me lots of tips?"
"LORELAI: Oh, what I can remember."
"SOOKIE: Get your diary out from that year cause I wanna know it all."
"LORELAI: A lot of my diary from that year was, um, a debate over which member of Tears for Fears I loved more at that particular moment."
"SOOKIE: That's probably not going to help me much."
"LORELAI: What are you doing out here? It's cold."
"SOOKIE: Well, we finished eating and I needed a break. Rough day. We didn't get home until eight."
"LORELAI: Eight? Your appointment was at six."
"SOOKIE: Jackson won't drive home faster than seven miles an hour. He doesn't wanna jiggle Baby."
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: We spent ten minutes on one speed bump. I could've walked home faster. And he's got this wild look in his eye like he's some kind of death rocker or something, and he's making lots of calls, and he punched the calculator so much he broke it."
"[Jackson walks out of the house]"
"JACKSON: We're selling the truck."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"JACKSON: It's the only way we're going to afford the minivan."
"SOOKIE: I thought you broke the calculator."
"JACKSON: I'm using a pencil. Hi Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi Jackson, congratulations."
"SOOKIE: We don't need a van."
"JACKSON: And I'm getting a haircut and buying a second tie. [the phone rings] Oh, I'll get it. It's probably the contractor."
"SOOKIE: What contractor?"
"JACKSON: The add-on."
"SOOKIE: What add-on?"
"JACKSON: The expansion, Sookie, the expansion. [walks into the house]"
"SOOKIE: He's expanding something."
"LORELAI: He's, uh, being very cryptic."
"SOOKIE: I don't wanna expand anything. And did you see his eyes?"
"LORELAI: Tasmanian devil."
"SOOKIE: When I came home, he was baby-proofing the house, he'd thrown away all our prescription drugs, and he was stuffing newspaper into the electrical sockets. He's insane."
"[Jackson walks out with the phone]"
"JACKSON: [oh phone] Hold on, Tom. [to Sookie] He says we have to move out for three months to do the add-on. We probably don't wanna do that."
"SOOKIE: Probably not."
"[Jackson walks back into the house]"
"LORELAI: Have you tried slapping him?"
"SOOKIE: No, he won't let me lift my arm above my head in case it stretches Baby. This stinks. We never even got to celebrate. He went straight to budgets and minivans."
"LORELAI: Aw, well, what he's doing is sweet in its own obnoxious way."
"SOOKIE: I guess I'll have to let him be male."
"LORELAI: So, listen, um, I ran into Max Medina."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God, really? How weird was that?"
"LORELAI: A little. Not as much as I would have thought."
"SOOKIE: He's such a good guy."
"LORELAI: Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that."
"SOOKIE: Well, was he nice to you?"
"LORELAI: Very. I mean, what happened with us was so long ago. Do you think what I did to him was really horrible?"
"SOOKIE: You mean dumping him in the gutter? Sure."
"LORELAI: Yeah, people are pretty unanimous on that, too."
"SOOKIE: So, Max Medina's back."
"LORELAI: Not for long, though. I just hope he doesn't hate me. He was probably just being nice. I just don't want him to hate me."
"SOOKIE: You didn't mean to hurt him."
"LORELAI: I'll write him a note or something. I owe him that."
"[Jackson walks out of the house and holds up a cleaver.]"
"LORELAI/SOOKIE: Oh!"
"JACKSON: What is this?"
"SOOKIE: It's my cleaver."
"JACKSON: What if Baby fell on it?"
"SOOKIE: You mean, what if Baby rolled off the sink and into the open second drawer? It wouldn't be good."
"JACKSON: It has to go."
"SOOKIE: I need it to chop stuff."
"JACKSON: We're switching to plastic."
"SOOKIE: I can't use plastic."
"JACKSON: And the Saran Wrap's history, too."
"SOOKIE: Jackson!"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks through the front door. The phone is ringing]"
"RORY: [answers phone] Hello?"
"WOMAN: Rory Gilmore, please."
"RORY: This is Rory Gilmore."
"WOMAN: Please hold. I'm connecting Headmaster Charleston and Paris Gellar."
"RORY: What? You're what, hello?"
"WOMAN: Miss Gilmore?"
"RORY: I'm here."
"WOMAN: Miss Gellar?"
"PARIS: I'm here."
"WOMAN: Please hold, I'm connecting Headmaster Charleston. [pause] Miss Gilmore, Miss Gellar, you have Headmaster Charleston."
"HEADMASTER: Ladies, hello. I hope you're having a pleasant evening."
"RORY: Yes, sir."
"PARIS: Very pleasant."
"HEADMASTER: Wonderful to hear. Well, let's get down to it, shall we? I was very impressed with both of your speeches today. They were well written, well researched, and eloquently delivered. You should be very proud."
"RORY: Thank you, we were."
"PARIS: Who won?"
"HEADMASTER: Just the simple act of completing a task well is in itself a win, is it not Miss Gellar?"
"PARIS: Yes, sir."
"HEADMASTER: Wonderful. Anyhow, as I was listening to you both this afternoon, a thought kept rolling around in my head. I was thinking what a pity it is I will have to choose just one. But then I realized, Hold on a minute here. I'm the headmaster at this school, I'm in charge of this competition, I can change the rules if I wish to.' So I am."
"RORY: You are?"
"PARIS: You are what?"
"HEADMASTER: I am changing the rules. Instead of having one speaker at our bicentennial, we will have two. You will combine your speeches and present them together."
"PARIS: You're kidding."
"HEADMASTER: I assure you I am not. I think it will be an excellent way to pay proper tribute to our school. So, what do you think of my little plan?"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"PARIS: It's, uh. . ."
"HEADMASTER: Brilliant. Yes, I think so, too. That's all. Congratulations. I would like the revised copy of your speech on my desk by Tuesday. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. [hangs up]"
"PARIS: Well, look who's suddenly decided to become Kofi Annan."
"RORY: Excuse me?"
"PARIS: Charleston thinks we need to play nice with each other, so he screws up the whole bicentennial. This sucks."
"RORY: Yes, it does suck."
"PARIS: So, what do we do now?"
"RORY: Do we have a choice?"
"PARIS: Of course we have a choice. You could say no."
"RORY: Why could I say no? You could say no."
"PARIS: I could not say no. C-SPAN is going to be there."
"RORY: Well, I like C-SPAN as much as you do."
"PARIS: You do not."
"RORY: I do, too. Ask my mom, it's all I talk about."
"PARIS: So, I guess we need a game plan now."
"RORY: Okay. We can meet at school tomorrow and work on it."
"PARIS: Or we could do it over the phone."
"RORY: Over the phone?"
"PARIS: We're just combining two speeches, Rory. There's no reason we have to sit in the same room and stare at each other."
"RORY: Fine, whatever you want."
"PARIS: Tomorrow night, six o'clock, I'll call you."
"RORY: I can't wait."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[The doorbell rings. Rory answers the door, Paris is standing there]"
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"PARIS: We have a speech to write."
"RORY: Yes, but we were supposed to do it over the phone. That was the plan."
"PARIS: Well, it's a ridiculous plan. We have to put two speeches together. We have to rehearse them, we have to hone our timing. None of that can be done effectively over the phone."
"RORY: But it was your idea."
"PARIS: Oh, like you fought me on it?"
"RORY: Of course I didn't fight you on it."
"PARIS: Well, okay then."
"RORY: What, okay then? Our conversation did not just come to a close. There was not a decision made back there just now."
"PARIS: Look, I'm here, we should just do this and get it over with. Do you wanna study here or in your bedroom? Fine, I'll go to a payphone. Do you have payphones in this town or are you still using a town crier?"
"RORY: We'll do it here."
"PARIS: Whatever you say."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"PARIS: So, I think the first thing to do is to acquaint ourselves with each others' speeches so we can judge who hit which point best. Here. [hands Rory her speech]"
"RORY: Mine. [hands Paris her speech]"
"PARIS: Good. Let's read. Why did you use this font?"
"RORY: Because I was on the crack."
"PARIS: Did you check these facts?"
"RORY: Yes, I did."
"PARIS: And the spelling of these names?"
"RORY: Yes, I did."
"PARIS: Rory?"
"RORY: What, Paris?"
"PARIS: I slept with Jamie. Last night, after we talked."
"RORY: Was it something I said?"
"PARIS: I went over there to study and he lit a fire and then we did it. What are your thoughts on that?"
"RORY: My thoughts?"
"PARIS: Because I'm not exactly sure how I feel about it myself yet. I've been going over it in my head. I mean, it seemed to go pretty well. The fire was nice and thank God he didn't try to put on any ridiculous makeout music, and then it just happened. I was actually fairly surprised at the timing of it because I wasn't wearing anything particularly alluring, and in the moments just before the act. . ."
"RORY: Oh, God."
"PARIS: We were actually discussing modern day Marxism in America, which is not what I would have deemed a come and get it' sort of conversation, but nevertheless, he came and got it, and I have to figure out what that means to me on a psychological level. So, I thought maybe if you and I could have sort of a healthy debate about it, I could come to some sort of reasonable conclusion about how I should be feeling right about now. So, come on, talk. What do you think?"
"RORY: I "
"PARIS: Are you pro?"
"RORY: Well "
"PARIS: Con?"
"RORY: Well "
"PARIS: Undecided?"
"RORY: Paris, just stop talking for one second and let me get my mind around this."
"PARIS: Sorry, go ahead, focus."
"[Lorelai walks in through the front door and overhears their conversation from the hall]"
"PARIS: Could you focus faster because I really need some feedback here."
"RORY: Okay, so you are telling me that you and Jamie. . ."
"PARIS: Had sex."
"RORY: Okay, so, were you safe?"
"PARIS: Yes, it was a regular after school special."
"RORY: Well, was he nice to you?"
"PARIS: Yes, he was very nice to me."
"RORY: And the two of you had discussed this. . ."
"PARIS: Well, I don't know that we actually discussed it, it was just sort of implied."
"RORY: Implied?"
"PARIS: Yes, implied. When you're dating a boy and you're together for a given amount of time and you're not Amish, then the eventual occurrence of intercourse is inevitable. I mean, wasn't it with you?"
"RORY: What?"
"PARIS: With Dean."
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: No?"
"RORY: No. I never did it with Dean."
"PARIS: Oh. Well, then with Jess, right?"
"RORY: Um, no."
"PARIS: You're lying."
"RORY: No, I'm not lying."
"PARIS: You haven't?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Why not?"
"RORY: I just haven't. It's just not the time."
"[Lorelai quietly walks back out of the house]"
"PARIS: Why is it not the time? I mean, if it's not the time for you, then maybe it's not the time for me either."
"RORY: Paris, you can't judge what's right for you against what's right for me. I mean, we are different, and Jamie and Jess are different."
"PARIS: Well, yeah."
"RORY: Maybe it was the time for the two of you."
"PARIS: I guess. I just wish I had the data to back it up."
"RORY: Some things can't be analyzed."
"PARIS: Listen, Rory, these last few weeks, Francie got things all twisted around."
"RORY: You let her get things all twisted around."
"PARIS: I know. I just tend to believe the worst in people, you know?"
"RORY: Oh yeah, I know."
"PARIS: I'm. . ."
"RORY: That's okay."
"LORELAI: [from kitchen] Hello, Mommy's home!"
"RORY: We're in here."
"LORELAI: We're, who's we're? Oh, hey Paris. I didn't know you were coming over tonight."
"PARIS: It wasn't planned."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, I brought pizza if you guys are hungry."
"PARIS: I have to take my retainer out first."
"RORY: I'll get the plates."
"[Paris walks toward the bathroom, Lorelai hugs Rory]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: I'm taking you shopping tomorrow."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: It just seems time. . .for new shoes."
"RORY: Okay. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: I've got the good kid."
"CUT TO CHILTON AUDITORIUM"
"[The headmaster is on stage addressing the audience]"
"HEADMASTER: . . .of two hundred years of tradition, Chilton begins its third century of educating this country's young students. . ."
"[Rory is waiting in the hallway outside the auditorium. Lorelai walks over to her]"
"LORELAI: Okay, I got the coats hung, and I slipped the girl a buck to get the really good hangers. You know, the ones with the dry cleaning foam strips still attached. Why are you frowning? Are you nervous?"
"RORY: What? No. I mean, yes. Paris is supposed to be here and she's not."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe she's just had a clothing crisis."
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Do you wanna call her?"
"RORY: I did, no answer."
"LORELAI: I'm sure she's fine, there's traffic. Just relax."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Richard walks up to them]"
"RICHARD: There you are."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Grandpa, you came."
"RICHARD: Of course I came. I wouldn't miss my granddaughter talking on national TV. That's quite a nice turnout you have here."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, we're very proud of the number of people who have nothing to do on a Friday night."
"RICHARD: Your mind never tires for a moment, does it?"
"LORELAI: It will once people start talking."
"RICHARD: Charming."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I'm gonna go track down some coffee cause there's no way they're not serving coffee at this thing. I'll be right back. Relax, she'll be here."
"CUT TO ANOTHER HALLWAY"
"[On her way to the coffee table, Lorelai passes Max, who is talking to someone]"
"MAX: [to man] Stanford has been really fantastic."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MAX: Hi. [to man] Will you excuse me for a moment?"
"MAN: Sure."
"[Max follows Lorelai to the coffee table]"
"MAX: We seem to be running into each other a lot lately."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on, you know where there's C-SPAN, there's. . .me."
"MAX: Is Rory around?"
"LORELAI: Um, she's looking for Paris and panicking she's gonna have to do this alone."
"MAX: Well, Paris'll come."
"LORELAI: I told her that. Listen, do you have a second?"
"MAX: Sure."
"LORELAI: I just, um. . .I just wanna talk to you about. . .uh. . ."
"[they walk to an empty classroom]"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to get away from. . .anyhow. We just haven't really talked since. . ."
"MAX: No, we haven't."
"LORELAI: I always meant to call you, but I'm not good at calling when a call is really necessary. And then, you know, uh, if you don't call for awhile, it gets harder to call, and then after awhile, it feels like it's too late to call, and so you don't, although you always know that you should've called, and I should've called."
"MAX: It's okay."
"LORELAI: No, it's not. I never really explained what happened."
"MAX: You didn't marry me."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know, but I never really explained why. I just didn't."
"MAX: You didn't love me."
"LORELAI: I don't think I didn't love you. I think. . .I think I was not ready to get married."
"MAX: Because you didn't love me."
"LORELAI: No, I really don't think that was it. Sometimes the person you love is not the person you're ready to live with forever. I'm not saying this is right, but "
"MAX: Lorelai, listen to me. I appreciate this, I really do, but there's no need for it. I'm really okay."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I know you're. . .no, I'm sure you're okay. I'm not saying this because you don't look okay. You look great. Really great. Although, I'm not saying this because you look really great, although you do. Did you join a gym in California?"
"MAX: Lorelai, look. I've always wanted to teach at a university like Stanford. And finally, the opportunity came up, I went, and it was wonderful. And, frankly, if we had been getting married, I wouldn't have been able to take it."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"MAX: And being away gave me time to think. I thought, and now I'm fine."
"LORELAI: It's just, we never had any closure."
"MAX: Life's not really about closure, is it?"
"LORELAI: No, I guess not. So, you're okay?"
"MAX: I'm okay. I'm over it."
"LORELAI: You sure?"
"MAX: I am completely sure."
"LORELAI: Well, then. . .boy, don't I feel stupid."
"MAX: You are many things, but stupid is not one of them."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm really glad I got to see you again."
"MAX: Me, too. I better get back."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM"
"[Rory and Richard are waiting in the hallway. The headmaster walks over to them.]"
"HEADMASTER: Rory, you and Paris should get ready, you're going on next. Richard, I didn't know you were coming, how are you?"
"RICHARD: Very, very well, Hanlin."
"HEADMASTER: Wonderful. Here, let me find you a seat."
"RICHARD: Ah, I'm also with my daughter."
"HEADMASTER: Well, then let me find you two seats. Rory, where's Paris?"
"RORY: I don't know, I haven't seen her and I called her house."
"HEADMASTER: Oh, dear. Well, I hope you know both parts. [walks away]"
"RORY: Okay, great."
"RICHARD: You are going to be wonderful, trust me. Now, did anyone ever to tell you to picture the audience in their underwear?"
"RORY: Yes."
"RICHARD: Well, don't do it. I did it once and I had nightmares for a week. Bulgarians in Speedos."
"RORY: Say no more."
"[Lorelai walks over to them]"
"LORELAI: Hey, they're rounding us up. Is she here yet?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, just. . .oh, there she is."
"RORY: Where? [sees Paris down the hall] Oh, thank you God."
"LORELAI: Okay, be great. We'll see you afterward."
"RORY: [walks over to Paris] Where have you been? Paris, you okay?"
"CUT TO AUDITORIUM"
"[The headmaster is addressing the audience]"
"HEADMASTER: And it is with great pleasure that I introduce two young ladies that epitomize the very best of what Chilton has to offer."
"RORY: Paris, are you okay?"
"HEADMASTER: Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you Paris Gellar and Rory Gilmore."
"[The crowd applauds as Rory and Paris walk onto the stage]"
"RORY: ""Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then do something. Don't just stand there, make it happen."" Lee Iacocca. ""Education's purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one."" Malcolm Forbes. ""Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught."" Oscar Wilde. These are only three of many countless views on the expansion of the human mind. I personally believe in all of them, and fortunately for me, so does Chilton. An institution not just because of age and standing, but because of ideas. Because it encourages ideas and it will accept nothing less than everything you have to give. This is the place where our lives start."
"PARIS: You know, it's funny, me standing here before you right now. I've thought about nothing else for four years but this school, this big important school with all of its history and tradition and really super teachers. And I dedicated myself to it completely, heart and soul, believing in its power, believing in its ability to get me where I needed to go. Harvard. I thought of nothing else. Many of you out there can attest to that fact. I was on my way and nothing could stop me. And here's the really funny thing  after four years of slaving away, I go home today and I found this. [holds up an envelope] I'm not going to Harvard. I got the tiny envelope, the one that reads, ""Sorry, Paris. We're not interested. Try again next year. Love, Harvard."" And the thing that's really funny here is, who in the world deserves to go to Harvard more than me? Have you seen how hard I've worked over these past four years? I mean, can anyone here believe that I'm not going to Harvard? I can't. I'm not going to Harvard. I am not going to Harvard. I had sex, but I'm not going to Harvard."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: And I have to tell you that if you asked me which of those two events I thought would be the least likely to happen, it would not be the not going to Harvard."
"RORY: Thank you and good night."
"PARIS: I'm being punished. I had sex, so now I don't get to go to Harvard."
"RORY: Paris, come on. [leads Paris off the stage]"
"PARIS: She's never had sex. She'll probably go to Harvard. She's a shoe in. Pack your chastity belt, Gilmore  you're going to Harvard!"
"RORY: Come on!"
"[In the audience, Lorelai glances at Richard, who is sleeping]"
"CUT TO BACKSTAGE"
"[Rory and Paris sit on a staircase. Paris is crying]"
"PARIS: How could I have not gotten into Harvard? Five generations of Gellars have gotten into Harvard. Even if I was the Billy Carter of the family, the name is still supposed to carry some weight."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: They had to really not like me for me to not get in."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: It's like they know me or something."
"RORY: Stop. I know how much this meant to you, Paris, but you are going to get just as good an education at one of the other great schools you're destined to get into. And you know what? Maybe it's a good thing that you're going to a different school than the rest of your family. You'll be doing your own thing, starting your own tradition. Doesn't that sound exciting?"
"PARIS: I can't believe I slept with Jamie. I'm a slut."
"RORY: No, you're not. You love him."
"PARIS: What if he doesn't love me anymore? What if he doesn't think I'm special anymore? How am I going to tell him I didn't get into Harvard? What am I gonna do?"
"RORY: Paris, I don't know why you didn't get into Harvard, but you are so smart and so special and you'll see, everything's gonna be fine."
"[Lorelai opens the door]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay."
"RORY: Yeah, we've got everything under control, thanks."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll be outside when you're ready. No rush."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Lorelai leaves]"
"PARIS: Well, all I've gotta say is, after all the trouble this sex thing has caused me, I better have been good."
"RORY: That's the perspective I know and love."
"CUT TO HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai walks up to Richard by the coat racks]"
"LORELAI: Dad, hi, sorry. I was just checking on the girls."
"RICHARD: Well, I hope they're feeling very good about themselves. They did a wonderful job."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I'm sure they'll be very pleased to hear you think so."
"RICHARD: Listen, um, I need to get home. Uh, I'm expecting a very important call from China that unfortunately I cannot miss."
"LORELAI: That's fine, Dad. I'll tell Rory you had to go."
"RICHARD: All right. And tell her I'll call her later, and give her this. [hands Lorelai an envelope]"
"LORELAI: Aw, that's very nice. Now how about my finder's fee?"
"RICHARD: You're very amusing. Thank you for a lovely evening, and I'll see the two of you on Friday."
"LORELAI: Good night. Sleep tight."
"[Richard leaves]"
"LORELAI: [to coat-check woman] Um, excuse me, hi. I am not seeing my coat here, and it was very cute and it was on sale, and I will fling myself off a building if I lose it."
"WOMAN: We put some of the coat racks in the classroom over there, take a look. Otherwise the staircase to the roof is on your right."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Hm. Took two hundred years, but somebody at Chilton finally cracked a joke."
"CUT TO CLASSROOM"
"[Lorelai walks in and finds her coat in the racks. Max walks in]"
"MAX: Okay. So, this is where they keep the coats they're ashamed of."
"LORELAI: Well, this school has taken snobbery to a whole new level."
"MAX: So, is Rory okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I just went back there. She's taking care of Paris, but she's good, thanks."
"MAX: I must say, I've been a teacher for ten years now, and it wasn't until today I realized, it must be really hard to be a girl."
"LORELAI: And with the invention of Sephora, really expensive, too."
"MAX: I'm very sorry."
"LORELAI: Oh, don't be. At least we get to wear skirts without being Scottish or riding a float in the gay pride parade."
"MAX: Well, that'll change someday my friend, and when it does, I still won't wear a skirt. But I'll applaud those that do, and then cross the street so nobody sees I'm with them."
"LORELAI: It was nice seeing you."
"MAX: Nice to see you, too."
"LORELAI: Take care of yourself."
"MAX: I will."
"[They kiss]"
"MAX: And apparently, I'm not over it."
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S BEDROOM"
"[Jackson taps Sookie on the shoulder]"
"SOOKIE: I'm not getting rid of my knives, Jackson. I'm a chef, I have to have knives."
"JACKSON: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: And I'm also not cutting off the water supply and I'm not sanding down all the edges of my furniture. Now, I'm sorry that you think this house is a deathtrap, and I'm sorry that you think there is nothing in our lifestyles that is conducive to having a baby, but our kid is gonna have to be bright enough not to disconnect the water hose that goes to the a*t*matic ice maker and shove it up his or her nose. Now go to sleep."
"JACKSON: Did I tell you how happy I am?"
"SOOKIE: No, you didn't."
"JACKSON: I have never been happier about anything in my entire life."
"SOOKIE: Really?"
"JACKSON: Our wedding day, but this is running a really close second."
"SOOKIE: Jackson."
"JACKSON: Now if you would just get rid of the knives, I think it could make it a tie. I wasn't kidding about the knives."
"SOOKIE: Goodnight Jackson."
"JACKSON: If I could read you the statistics just one more time."
"SOOKIE: I love you, Jackson."
"JACKSON: Hold on, I'll find them."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk across the yard toward the mailbox]"
"RORY: But "
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: What does this mean?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: What are you gonna do?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: What about Alex?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: But is Max going to "
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, have you gotten the clue? There's not gonna be a wealth of information tonight."
"RORY: Sorry. [they stop at the mailbox] It's just so. . ."
"[Lorelai opens the mailbox. She pulls out a large envelope and hands it to Rory]"
"LORELAI: The big one."
"RORY: Looks like Paris was right."
"[Lorelai pulls out two more large envelopes]"
"LORELAI: Apparently, you are the biggest virgin in the world. Wow. So, what?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Well, what does this mean?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Which one are you gonna choose?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: I guess we better go inside. We both have a lot of things to figure out, huh?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: Yeah. So what are the odds that Paris is ever gonna have sex again in this lifetime?"
"RORY: I don't know."

"OPEN IN LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table with papers and books spread out in front of them.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, let's see. Looks like Harvard definitely has the smallest class sizes."
"RORY: Okay, we've got our first entry here. It's a pro for Harvard."
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, whoa, those are not the final official pro/con lists."
"RORY: Why? What's wrong with them?"
"LORELAI: Well, the lines are crooked, the printing's all sloppy. Harvard, Princeton and Yale cannot see them looking like that."
"RORY: They're not going to see our pro/con lists."
"LORELAI: What if they subpoena them?"
"RORY: Then I'll roll them up in a ball and eat them."
"LORELAI: Oh, a big pro for Yale  they have 1100 members of the maintenance staff. Clean, clean, clean."
"RORY: All three of these places probably have the same number."
"LORELAI: But Yale must be crowing about it for some reason. Princeton might only have two."
"RORY: Two?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: You think there're a total of two guys cleaning all of Princeton?"
"LORELAI: Write ""Princeton's stinking filthy"" in big letters."
"RORY: Yeah, I'm pretending to write it as we speak."
"[Kirk walks over carrying a box of T-shirts]"
"KIRK: Good morning, ladies. May I interest you in a shirt?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Kirk. You're not selling your laundry again, are ya?"
"KIRK: No, these are part of my latest money-making endeavor. I'm going to print daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline of something I witness around town."
"RORY: Neat."
"KIRK: I got the idea when I read about something a man was doing in Portland."
"LORELAI: What was he doing?"
"KIRK: He was printing daily T-shirts featuring a humorous topical headline of something he witnessed around town."
"RORY: Is that today's?"
"KIRK: Sure is. [he holds up a shirt]"
"RORY: [reads] ""Babette ate oatmeal."" Huh."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"KIRK: I'm keeping it real."
"RORY: It's good."
"LORELAI: It paints a picture."
"RORY: I can just see her. . .eating oatmeal."
"[Luke walks up to the table]"
"KIRK: They're $14.95. How many can I put you down for?"
"LUKE: No solicitors, Kirk."
"KIRK: How about if I cut you in for a piece of the action?"
"LUKE: How about I toss the shirts out the door first so you can have something to land on?"
"KIRK: Got it. [walks away]"
"LUKE: What's with the lists?"
"LORELAI: You ready? My Rory, our Rory, Stars Hollow's Rory. . .got into Harvard, Princeton, and Yale."
"LUKE: Wow, wow, wow, I can't believe it. I  I feel like I. . ."
"RORY: Yeah."
"[Luke awkwardly hugs Rory's head]"
"RORY: Oh."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"[Luke pulls back]"
"LUKE: Oh, I'm not good at hugging."
"RORY: Oh, I thought it worked."
"LUKE: Thanks. Man, this is big, right?"
"RORY: Very big."
"LUKE: But what's with all the pro/con lists?"
"LORELAI: That's how we make our important decisions, you know that."
"LUKE: But you know what it's gonna be, Harvard."
"RORY: Probably."
"LORELAI: But not necessarily."
"LUKE: But Harvard's all you've talked about for years."
"LORELAI: Well, who knew she'd be wanted by everyone?"
"LUKE: Hey, which school best teaches how to make an important life decision without doing a stupid pro/con list? Whichever one it is, add it to the pro column."
"LORELAI: Do not mock the sciencificity of our selection process."
"RORY: I've gotta head to school."
"LORELAI: Hey, why go anymore? You're in college. Let's go truffle hunting or something."
"RORY: Maybe after I graduate."
"LORELAI: All right, but if all the good truffles are gone, don't say I didn't warn you."
"RORY: Bye. [leaves]"
"LUKE: I can't believe how great that is, all three."
"LORELAI: Well, they have good taste."
"LUKE: Well. . .you know, uh, Jess also. . .well, it's so tiny compared to this, it's gonna sound dumb."
"LORELAI: What? Tell me."
"LUKE: Well, you know how Jess works at Wal-Mart."
"LORELAI: Yes, I do."
"LUKE: Well, it seems he was actually chosen Employee of the Month."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: I knew it would sound tiny."
"LORELAI: No, Luke, that's not tiny. That's really good."
"LUKE: Yeah. I mean, there's probably hundreds of people working at that branch, and they singled him out."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it shows he can work hard and get along with people and all that. You should be proud. Did you tell him you're proud?"
"LUKE: Well, he didn't even tell me about it. I got a letter addressed to the family of Jess Mariano inviting me down to some little ceremony they're having."
"LORELAI: Are you going?"
"LUKE: Oh, he'd hate it if I was there. You know, seeing him participating in some corporate ceremony like that, being called upstanding and responsible, it would k*ll him. Yeah, I'm going."
"LORELAI: Good boy."
"[Luke sees that Kirk is trying to sell his shirts at another table. Kirk quickly pushes the shirts off the table into a box]"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey Sookie, Sookie. . .where's Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Down here."
"LORELAI: Down where? Marco?"
"SOOKIE: Polo."
"[Lorelai finds Sookie kneeling on the floor next to a cat]"
"LORELAI: Why are you down there?"
"SOOKIE: Papaya won't eat, so I'm pretending to eat out of her bowl so she'll copy me."
"LORELAI: Sookie, you named the cat?"
"SOOKIE: She looks like a Papaya, doesn't she?"
"LORELAI: But it's a stray. You'll get close to it and it'll wander off and you'll be sad."
"SOOKIE: I'm keeping my distance. Come on, Papaya. Lap, lap, lap."
"LORELAI: All right, we're getting you up here. Come on."
"[Lorelai helps Sookie stand up]"
"SOOKIE: Oh boy, being a cat is hard on the knees."
"LORELAI: Since when are you a cat person?"
"SOOKIE: Well, ever since I got pregnant, I've become very nurturing toward all living things. Jackson, too."
"LORELAI: Well, both your bodies are changing."
"SOOKIE: Yesterday.. .ugh, it was awful. Jackson moved a table and just kind of nicked this spider. He didn't see the little thing, and just clipped one of its legs. And it was having trouble walking and we were so upset, but Jackson made a new leg for it out of a paper clip, but jamming the clip into the spider k*ll it instantly. Little Satchmo."
"LORELAI: You named the spider Satchmo?"
"SOOKIE: After Jackson's uncle."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure he'll be very touched."
"SOOKIE: Maybe if I wore ears!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"[Sookie holds two napkins up behind her head to look like cat ears, then kneels back down on the floor]"
"SOOKIE: Papaya! Look at Mommy, look at Mommy, look at Mommy."
"[Lorelai walks into the lobby]"
"LORELAI: Oh, is this everyone from the Edgar Allen Poe Society?"
"MICHEL: If you mean the I-should-be-sterilized-so-that-my-disturbing-idiosyncrasies-aren't-passed-onto-the-next-generation society, then yes, that's them."
"LORELAI: [to guests checking in] Hi, welcome to the Independence Inn."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Thank you. We're Jim and Milly Hatlestad."
"LORELAI: Okay, I've got you right here. Well, once again, welcome, and let me assure you there are no human body parts buried in the floor of your room to keep you awake tonight. Sound good?"
"MR. HATLESTAD: I guess."
"LORELAI: Room 8."
"[The Hatlestads walk away]"
"LORELAI: The Tell-Tale Heart. That's a Poe story. Did they not get that?"
"MICHEL: The Hatlestads are not with the Poe Society."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you tell me that?"
"MICHEL: If I had thought to, I still would not have."
"FRED: Hi, my name is Larson, I'm checking in."
"LORELAI: Poe Society, right?"
"FRED: That's me."
"LORELAI: Good. Well, welcome to the Independence Inn. There will be a complimentary cask of amontillado on the table in your room, and if you're expecting your friends Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether, I'll send up another one. [pause] You said you were with the Poe Society."
"FRED: Yeah, but it's just a hobby. We're not Trekkies."
"LORELAI: No, no, I didn't mean to imply. . .I mean, you're not freaks, no way. Here, room six."
"FRED: Thank you. [walks away]"
"MICHEL: You might want to stop trying to cute things up."
"LORELAI: I hear that."
"MICHEL: [to guest] Hello sir."
"CUT TO WAL-MART BREAK ROOM"
"[The manager walks to the front of the room. Luke walks in and sits down in back.]"
"MANAGER: Hello everybody. Hope you're having a good day today. You folks know we do this every month, just a little get together to honor our new Employee of the Month. Nothing fancy, just a quick thanks' and a way to go.' Oh, and there's two hundred bucks in it. I think that's how we got our honoree to even show up to this thing. You know him as a trooper, our Mr. Reliable. The first time this young man sat down on that forklift, well, it was like an extension of himself. And yeah, he's not one for small talk, but this boy's production is out of sight. It's Jess Mariano everybody."
"[The other employees applaud as Jess walks up to accept a plaque]"
"MANAGER: Would you like to say anything Jess?"
"JESS: Nope."
"MANAGER: Well, that's our Jess. Give him another hand folks, and, uh, have a good one."
"[Jess walks to the back of the room and sees Luke]"
"JESS: What are you doing here?"
"LUKE: [pinches Jess' cheek] I'm so proud of my boy."
"JESS: Stop it."
"LUKE: Do you have a tissue because I think I'm gonna be emotional."
"JESS: I mean it, stop, now. It came with cash, it's the only reason I'm here."
"LUKE: Don't forget the plaque. You should hang that over your bed, shine a little spotlight over it."
"JESS: I gotta get back to work."
"LUKE: Yeah, the forklift's going where's the extension of me?'"
"[Jess leaves. The manager walks over to Luke]"
"MANAGER: Hey. Saw you jawboning with our boy there. I'm Bill Borden."
"LUKE: Luke Danes, I'm Jess' uncle."
"MANAGER: Nice meeting you."
"LUKE: Yeah, so he's doing good, huh?"
"MANAGER: Wish I had a dozen more Jesses. He's my go-to guy."
"LUKE: That's great to hear."
"MANAGER: Works like a dog on his regular shift, and if someone calls in sick  and they always do  Jess is there even if he's already done forty hours that week."
"LUKE: Wow, I am so . . .forty hours? He never works forty hours."
"MANAGER: More like forty-five, that's what I'm saying. Good boy, that one."
"LUKE: Wait, how is that possible? He's got school, he works for me, it can't be forty."
"MANAGER: Well, I can't say I sign every time card, but I'm pretty sure it's at least that. Uh, maybe I'm mistaken."
"LUKE: Yeah, maybe."
"MANAGER: Oh, thought you might like this. A little keepsake for ya. [hands him an Employee of the Month sign with Jess' picture on it]"
"LUKE: Great, thanks."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO"
"[A man dressed as Poe is reciting The Raven at the front of the room.]"
"POE 1: Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, ""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven."""
"LORELAI: [quietly to Rory] That Poe was downright funalicious."
"RORY: He was a troubled man. He enjoyed a little bit too much of the hmm-hmm. [makes a drinking gesture]"
"LORELAI: Mime?"
"RORY: You know what I meant."
"LORELAI: Oh, mime. That reminds me  Yale, best drama school bar none. Put that in the pro column."
"RORY: I'm not taking drama."
"LORELAI: No, but it means you'll have the best on-campus productions. You'll get to see the next Meryl Streep all goofy and eighteen and doing crap like, ""Hey, name an occupation!"" ""Plumber!"" ""Name a farm tool now!"" ""Tractor!"" ""Hey, I'm a tractor doing. . .plumbing."""
"RORY: That's what the do at the Yale drama school?"
"LORELAI: So I've heard. Oh, that's weird."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Over there. [points to another man dressed like Poe seated in the audience]"
"RORY: A second Poe?"
"LORELAI: It's like a Poe story in itself."
"RORY: The Case of the Two Poes."
"LORELAI: The Messrs Poe and Poe."
"RORY: Oh, that's good."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, there's Dean. Hey, is that, uh. . ."
"RORY: That's Lindsay."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[Dean sees them and waves. Lindsay glances at Rory]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I think she's ready to go to the ghetto on you."
"RORY: Well, I don't have a problem with her. She's really nice. And, you know, once she "
"LORELAI: Bought you a magnet shaped like Mark Twain's head? Yes, I've heard the anecdote."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: I think she should just mellow. I mean, you've both moved on. What's the problem?"
"POE 1: But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only that one word. . ."
"LORELAI: I don't remember The Raven being this long."
"RORY: It could've used some editing."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, did you put drama school on the Yale pro list?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Come on, do it, we'll forget."
"RORY: I don't have a pen."
"LORELAI: Aw, jeez. [leans toward Luke and Nicole sitting across the aisle] Hey, psst. Hi, Nicole."
"NICOLE: Hi, Lorelai."
"LUKE: Hey, how long is this thing?"
"LORELAI: He's got at least five nevermores to go."
"LUKE: Ah, jeez."
"LORELAI: Do you got a pen?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Come on, cough it up."
"LUKE: I don't have a pen."
"LORELAI: You've got a restaurant. Where's the pen you take orders with?"
"LUKE: I wasn't anticipating taking orders at the Poe reading."
"LORELAI: Hm, there goes your Boy Scout badge."
"RORY: Uh, Mom."
"[Poe 1 gives her a look, then continues]"
"POE 1: Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy. . ."
"LORELAI: Busted by a Poe."
"RORY: Hope he doesn't put a curse on us."
"LORELAI: Or complain when he goes back to being Fred Larson, Tampa dentist."
"NICOLE: Hey, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hm? [sees Nicole holding out a pen] Oh, you're an angel, thanks."
"NICOLE: I'll need it back."
"LORELAI: Yeah, sure."
"RORY: Hm, looks like Nicole's got a little Lindsay attitude going."
"LORELAI: Not really. Really?"
"MISS PATTY: Hey, how many nevermores do you think he's got to go?"
"LORELAI: We're guessing four."
"MISS PATTY: Poor Edgar Allen Poe, he suffered so much. And now we gotta suffer along with him."
"RORY: Yale drama, got it."
"MISS PATTY: Rory, why do you waste your time on those pro/con lists? It's going to be Harvard, we all know it."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: If the list says it is."
"RORY: Right."
"MISS PATTY: When you were six and took my cheerleading class, you wouldn't even cheer for any other school than Harvard."
"RORY: That's true. That is true."
"LORELAI: Well, then the list will reflect it."
"POE 1: And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted. . .nevermore."
"[the audience claps]"
"LORELAI: Excellent. Bravo, bravo."
"RORY: Very nice."
"WOMAN: That was wonderful, wasn't it? Thank you very much for that rendition."
"POE 1: Thank you."
"[he goes to sit down and the second Poe walks to the front]"
"LORELAI: What's with the Poes?"
"RORY: They look upset."
"MISS PATTY: Wanna hear the scoop?"
"RORY: Please."
"MISS PATTY: I was here when they both arrived. They got their signals crossed. They were supposed to perform different things, but they both came to do The Raven."
"LORELAI: If the Poes start fighting, does that punch a hole in the space/time continuum?"
"RORY: And throw us into a universe where everything is the exact opposite of what it is here?"
"LORELAI: Cool. There'll be funny sitcoms there."
"WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special treat for you. It'll allow you to compare and contrast interpretations of Poe's most famous work."
"RORY: Oh no."
"LORELAI: Compare and contrast?"
"RORY: That can only mean. . ."
"WOMAN: Please enjoy this second recitation of The Raven."
"LORELAI: Do we bolt?"
"RORY: Do we dare?"
"LORELAI: At least if I'd brought a flask, we could've played the nevermore drinking game."
"RORY: Oh, maybe this is what drove Poe to the bottle."
"LORELAI: His own work."
"POE 2: Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, while I nodded, nearly napping. . ."
"[Lorelai and Nicole share a look; Rory and Lindsay share a look]"
"LORELAI: Weird vibe in here. Very Poe."
"RORY: Very Poe."
"CUT TO OUTISDE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the dance studio]"
"RORY: Well, that was pretty good."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on. You can't do that thing where you complain, then when you walk out you reassess based on the relief you're feeling that it's over."
"RORY: Well, I was able to compare and contrast between readings."
"LORELAI: I was able to nap for twenty minutes."
"[The first Poe walks over to them]"
"POE 1: Good evening, ladies."
"LORELAI: Oh, hi Poe."
"RORY: Good job in there."
"POE 1: I thank you. Young miss, do correct me, but I heard tell that you are considering attending Harvard University."
"RORY: I am."
"POE 1: I myself attended West Point."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"POE 1: I'm embarrassed to say that I was court-martialed in 1832 and forced to leave."
"[The second Poe walks over]"
"POE 2: Excuse me, but I was expelled from West Point in 1831, not 1832."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"POE 1: No, I do believe it was 1832. It was an election year."
"POE 2: It was not an election year. President Jackson was to serve five more years"
"POE 1: I'm sure it was '32. I'm sad to say it was the same year my older brother William passed away."
"POE 2: Okay, that's not right either, Fred."
"POE 1: Fred? I don't know this Fred you speak of."
"POE 2: Oh, knock it off. I'm tired. [walks away]"
"POE 1: Will you excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. [he walks away] Poes are very testy people."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"[Kirk is sitting at a table with stacks of T-shirts]"
"KIRK: I've got your latest topical T-shirts here, people. Brand new topical T-shirts for sale."
"RORY: What's this one say?"
"[Kirk holds one up]"
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Faux Poes foes."""
"RORY: Very clever, Kirk."
"KIRK: It was an inspiration. But they're not selling much better than the ""Babette ate oatmeal"" shirts."
"LORELAI: Keep the dream, Kirk."
"[Dean and Lindsay walk out of the dance studio]"
"DEAN: Hey guys."
"RORY: Oh, hi. Mom, this is Lindsay."
"LINDSAY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi. The Mark Twain magnet-head girl!"
"LINDSAY: The what?"
"LORELAI: You don't know the anecdote? You're the star."
"LINDSAY: The anecdote?"
"RORY: It's nothing, really. Um, it's the field trip we took to Mark Twain's house in the fourth grade, and I wanted this magnet and you lent me the money and I got the magnet."
"LORELAI: She usually tells it better."
"LINDSAY: I kinda remember."
"DEAN: So, uh, congratulations on Harvard."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, thanks."
"DEAN: I got into Southern Connecticut State."
"RORY: Oh, that's great."
"LORELAI: It is. That's great, Dean."
"RORY: You're. . .you're. . . wow."
"DEAN: Yeah, thanks."
"LINDSAY: I've gotta get home."
"DEAN: And I gotta take her, so I'll see you guys."
"LORELAI: See ya."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Dean and Lindsay walk away]"
"LORELAI: So you say she was nice?"
"RORY: Was, I guess, being the operative word. So are we going?"
"LORELAI: No, you go on ahead, I'll catch up."
"RORY: Okay. Try and make it home in time for Charlie Rose. Billy Joel's on, and he might cry or something."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Rory leaves. Luke walks over to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: So, how was Jess' Employee of the Month thing?"
"LUKE: Oh, it was okay."
"LORELAI: Just okay?"
"LUKE: There was punch."
"LORELAI: So the punch wasn't good?"
"LUKE: No, it was just. . .the manager came up afterwards when Jess was gone and he was talking about how Jess is working forty, forty-five hours a week."
"LORELAI: What? That's full time."
"LUKE: That's what I said."
"LORELAI: How does he swing it?"
"LUKE: He must be pulling double shifts on the weekends. It's all I can think of."
"LORELAI: No, he's pretty much duding it with Rory on the weekends."
"LUKE: Well, then he must be getting up super early on weekday mornings and going in."
"LORELAI: Have you ever seen him do that?"
"LUKE: No, but I don't trail him either."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but you sleep in the same room with him."
"LUKE: Oh, the manager must be getting Jess confused with somebody else."
"LORELAI: Or. . ."
"LUKE: Or what?"
"LORELAI: I don't wanna say, forget it."
"LUKE: No, say it, go ahead."
"LORELAI: Or he's working when he should be in school."
"LUKE: Impossible, no way."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: Because he knows the rules  he's gotta graduate to stay living with me. He's going, he's getting everything done, he's doing his work."
"LORELAI: You've seen this work he's doing?"
"LUKE: Not for awhile, but I just know that he is. No, no way he's cutting school, it's su1c1de, no way."
"LORELAI: I shouldn't have brought it up"
"LUKE: Ah, that's okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: Goodnight."
"[Kirk walks up to the second Poe]"
"KIRK: Say, how can I have a career as a Poe?"
"POE 2: It's not a career, this is just an event that we do. I write technical manuals for a living."
"KIRK: Yes, but how can I have a career as a Poe?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is sleeping when Rory walks in with the cordless phone]"
"RORY: Mom. Mom, wake up."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Mom, it's Tobin at the inn, something's wrong."
"LORELAI: What's wrong?"
"RORY: The fire alarm's going off."
"LORELAI: That stupid alarm. It's always doing that. Tell him if he doesn't smell smoke, to reset it, and tell him he's fired and I'm gonna kick his ass around the lobby for waking me up."
"RORY: He sounds freaked."
"LORELAI: Ugh. [takes phone] Tobin, what?. . .Oh my God. . .Okay. [hangs up] Get dressed."
"RORY: What is it?"
"LORELAI: Get dressed, get dressed."
"CUT TO FRONT OF THE INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[The inn staff and guests are all gathered out front as the fire department puts out the fire.]"
"CHIEF BAKER: [into a walkie talkie] We've got the first engine laddering the roof, first engine. Yeah, and we need PD for traffic control."
"[Lorelai and Rory rush up to the crowd]"
"SOOKIE: Ah, Lorelai, thank God."
"LORELAI: Hey, what's going on?"
"SOOKIE: This is Lorelai Gilmore."
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"CHIEF BAKER: In a minute, ma'am."
"RORY: Yeah, Mom, let him do his thing."
"LORELAI: You're right. Sookie, Michel, um, is everyone out?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"SOOKIE: Yes. We're sure, the fire department's sure, we did a head count."
"LORELAI: We need to double check, triple check. Julio! He doesn't start til six but sometimes he comes here early because his sister-in-law Rita gives him a ride on her way to work in Salisbury."
"SOOKIE: Oh! [points to Julio in the crowd]"
"LORELAI: [walks over and hugs him] Ah, Julio, Julio. Ah, I'm so glad to see you, you beautiful man."
"[The fire chief walks over to Lorelai]"
"CHIEF BAKER: Ma'am, I'm Chief Baker."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry I jumped on ya."
"CHIEF BAKER: That's okay. The good news is that this is almost out. The structure's stable, and you're probably gonna be able to get back in in about 24 hours."
"LORELAI: Excellent. Twenty-four hours, the structure's stable, thank you."
"CHIEF BAKER: That's okay."
"LORELAI: The statue of you is going up just as soon as we get back in. Eighty feet tall."
"CHIEF BAKER: I'm looking forward to it."
"LORELAI: Here we go guys, phase two."
"SOOKIE: Loving the pace here."
"LORELAI: Um, we need food, we need computers with Internet, we need phones. Michel, I need this on you stat. Hurry, hurry. Rory?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Um, help the guests with the kids, make sure they're not freaked out. Gather them up and entertain them for awhile so the adults can catch their breath."
"RORY: Right. I have never entertained kids  how do I do that?"
"LORELAI: Uh, take your socks off and do a puppet show."
"RORY: You've clearly never entertained kids either."
"LORELAI: It's all I can think of. Get cracking."
"RORY: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: [to the guests] Hi everybody. Good morning, and uh, whoa, talk about your change of plans here. Unfortunately, you, uh, can't get your stuff out for at least a day. However, if you wanna get home immediately, we will check planes, trains, whatever you need. We will send your stuff to you later as soon as we get it. But if you can't get home yet, we will provide everything short of anything illegal, and that's gonna start with the best breakfast of your lives. [to Sookie] Uh, Sookie, go to the market and get whatever food and supplies we need for breakfast."
"SOOKIE: Going."
"[Sookie leaves. Lorelai walks over to Michel, who is on his cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Hey, who are you on with?"
"MICHEL: The Cheshire Cat Inn."
"LORELAI: Ah, great, find people places to sleep. Excellent. [walks away]"
"MICHEL: [on phone] Yes, my name is Michel Gerard, I used to work at the Independence Inn and I was wondering if there were any positions available."
"[Lorelai walks back over and grabs the phone from him]"
"MICHEL: Phones, computer, I'm on it."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai, Sookie and the inn's guests enter]"
"SOOKIE: Morning."
"LUKE: What, what is this?"
"SOOKIE: Phase two."
"LUKE: Phase two?"
"SOOKIE: Into the back, guys. March!"
"[Sookie's cooking staff carries food and supplies into Luke's kitchen]"
"LUKE: Hold on, those guys can't go back there."
"LORELAI: Oh, we're in luck, lots of empty tables. Go on and take your seats, guys."
"LUKE: Lorelai, what is this?"
"LORELAI: We had a fire."
"LUKE: Fire, where?"
"SOOKIE: Weston's Bakery."
"LUKE: You're kidding."
"SOOKIE: They'll have fresh blueberries."
"LORELAI: Perfect. Um, Weston's, hurry."
"LUKE: Where. . .Weston's caught fire?"
"LORELAI: No, the inn."
"LUKE: Your inn?"
"SOOKIE: Just move all of Luke's stuff aside, we don't need it."
"LUKE: Hey, wait a minute."
"LORELAI: Everyone's fine, the inn's still standing, we're into phase two."
"LUKE: What is phase two?"
"SOOKIE: Just shove it aside."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"SOOKIE: Making breakfast."
"LUKE: You can't make breakfast here."
"SOOKIE: Got any plates that aren't cracked?"
"LUKE: You're the one that's cracked."
"SOOKIE: Nice thing to say to a pregnant woman."
"LUKE: You're pregnant?"
"LORELAI: Could you be any farther behind?"
"SOOKIE: Yo, Caesar, help my guys and there's a twenty in it for you."
"LUKE: We both can't be making different stuff at the same time."
"LORELAI: You know, you're right. Listen, all you people who were here before we invaded, are you willing to cancel your current orders for Sookie's famous blueberry-lemon pancakes, Belgian waffles or bananas foster?"
"MAN: Sure."
"WOMAN: Sounds good."
"SOOKIE: Okay, pull all of Luke's stuff off the grill and let's get cooking!"
"LUKE: I'm an island."
"LORELAI: Luke, I'm sorry about all this, but I'm not anticipating the inn catching fire ever again, so it's a one time only thing, okay?"
"LUKE: Like I have a choice?"
"LORELAI: You do. Say the word and we go."
"LUKE: Stay, cook, eat. I'll be upstairs."
"LORELAI: You're a doll."
"SOOKIE: No, get rid of it! Dump it, dump it! I don't wanna see it!"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory is entertaining some kids by using her socks to give a puppet show. Lorelai walks over]"
"RORY: ""Where are you going? I told you to take out the garbage!"" ""Nag, nag, nag. I wanna watch football and sit in my reclining chair."" ""Get back here or I'm gonna get you. . ."" [sees Lorelai] Oh, hey, guys, hold on a second."
"BOY: No, keep going."
"RORY: Oh, calm down there, little scooter. I'll be right back."
"[Rory walks over to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Hey Shari Lewis, how's the show going?"
"RORY: Oh, they're riveted."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: Yeah, but I stink. I keep repeating the same stuff over and over again."
"LORELAI: Must be working."
"RORY: But I named them Mr. and Mrs. Sock Puppet. I put no energy into this."
"BOY: Come back, Rory."
"RORY: You would think that a lame-o sock puppet show would bore them to tears."
"LORELAI: It's your narrative k*ll. I mean, is he gonna take the garbage out, is he not gonna take the garbage out? I'm on the edge of my seat."
"RORY: Yeah, but they won't let me stop and I have to get to school eventually."
"LORELAI: Okay. [to kids] Hey, guys, go on over to the diner and have breakfast with your families, and then ask the nice man in the baseball hat and the flannel shirt to do sock puppets for you. And if he says no, just ask him louder  it's part of the game!"
"BOY: Oh boy!"
"LORELAI: Go!"
"[the kids run toward the diner]"
"RORY: You're cruel and they love you."
"LORELAI: Come check in at Patty's with me."
"CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO"
"[A table has been set up with a computer, phone, and other supplies as the temporary inn headquarters. Michel, Babette, and Miss Patty are at the table.]"
"BABETTE: I love computers, I just know nothing about them. What does pushing that F3 button do?"
"MICHEL: Annoy me to no end."
"BABETTE: What about the F4?"
"[the phone rings]"
"MISS PATTY: [answers] Hello, this is the Independence Inn emergency headquarters. I'm Miss patty, I'll be assisting you today. How may I help you? [pause] The printer will be here in half an hour, I'll let him know. Thank you. Goodbye. [hangs up] The printer will "
"MICHEL: I heard, and you've got to shorten your greeting."
"MISS PATTY: What?"
"MICHEL: You do not need to recite the Gettysburg Address every time you answer the phone."
"MISS PATTY: I was Ricardo Montalban's receptionist for six months and he never complained."
"MICHEL: Who?"
"MISS PATTY: Don't make me hit you."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"LORELAI: You all set up here?"
"MICHEL: Computer with Internet, phones forwarded here, printer on the way."
"MISS PATTY: I'm the receptionist."
"BABETTE: And I'm learning the computer."
"MICHEL: And I'm looking for my cyanide capsule  have you seen it?"
"LORELAI: It's nice of you to help guys, thanks. Now, at least half the Poe group needs to stay another night, so we're gonna need to find places to put them up."
"MICHEL: Everything is booked."
"LORELAI: You checked the Cheshire Cat, the Maiden's Teacup, the Cookie House, the Sugarbear Inn?"
"MICHEL: Every place that sounds like Glinda the Good Witch threw up, yes  all booked."
"LORELAI: Well, then, we're gonna have to take people in."
"MISS PATTY: Well, I can take a couple in, sweetie."
"BABETTE: I can, too. We got cots. Ooh-hoo-hoo, we got cots."
"LORELAI: Great. Michel?"
"MICHEL: Forget it. The Poes are weird. I'd fear being k*ll in my sleep. Plus, I don't like strangers using my toilet."
"BABETTE: I bet the Kims could put people up. And Taylor. And Al."
"LORELAI: And we've got our couch and my room."
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: They can have my room, not yours."
"LORELAI: No, hon, mine's fine."
"RORY: Mom, no, mine. You are stressed out enough without losing your room. You need your rest, so you keep your bed, period."
"LORELAI: I'll look selfish."
"RORY: Well, if anyone calls you that, I'll kick their sorry butts."
"LORELAI: Okay, your room under protest."
"BABETTE: Hey Michel, I just hit F4 and the num lock key and the one with the little apple on it and it's freaking out like it's on acid or something."
"MICHEL: Oy vey."
"[phone rings]"
"MISS PATTY: I got it. [answers] Yeah?"
"MICHEL: Well, you need to say more than that."
"MISS PATTY: Well, make up your mind."
"RORY: I've gotta go, but page me if there's any news or anything."
"LORELAI: Okay. You mean, like if Michel k*ll Babette and then Patty then himself in a bizarre m*rder pact?"
"RORY: Amongst other things."
"[they hug]"
"LORELAI: We had a fire."
"RORY: I know. Bye."
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"MRS. O'MALLEY: It'll be the last midterm of your high school careers, so rejoice over that if nothing else. [bell rings] Now, before you go, I just wanna mention that it looks like another banner year for Chilton grads seeking top colleges. I wanna congratulate all of those who have heard and advise patience for all of you who have not. No one has escaped from Chilton without going onto another terrific school if that is his or her goal."
"LOUISE: Good to hear."
"MRS. O'MALLEY: And I know that at least one of you has been accepted to Harvard. It's an immense honor, that. Congratulations."
"[students start to leave]"
"RORY: Have you guys heard from Paris?"
"MADELINE: Heard what?"
"RORY: Anything?"
"LOUISE: She's not here?"
"RORY: She's been gone for five days."
"LOUISE: Huh."
"MADELINE: Didn't notice."
"LOUISE: Although, it did seem like there was a lot more air in here."

"CUT TO PARIS' BEDROOM"
"[Paris is in bed watching television. There's a knock at the door. She ignores it, and there's a second knock]"
"PARIS: Come back for the tray later, Nanny."
"RORY: It's not Nanny, Paris. It's Rory. Can I come in?"
"PARIS: I guess."
"[Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hi. I brought a bunch of school stuff from the past few days. If there's anything missing, I can bring it over later."
"PARIS: Thank you. No offense, but my soap's starting."
"RORY: So, you're sick, huh?"
"PARIS: You know what's wrong. You of all people. That's Martin. His sister-in-law got kidnapped and he thinks his former lover is behind it."
"RORY: Juicy."
"PARIS: So, don't you have an announcement?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"PARIS: Did you get in?"
"RORY: You know, we don't have to. . ."
"PARIS: I know you did. You've got that Harvard glow about you, the glow of destiny."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Just tell me."
"RORY: I got in."
"PARIS: Ugh, Amanda and Richard. I'm so over them."
"RORY: So you've been incommunicado lately."
"PARIS: I've had Nanny hold all my calls, and the mail. My parents are away, so I've been totally Howard Hughes-ing it."
"RORY: So did you tell them about Harvard?"
"PARIS: No."
"RORY: Don't you think you should?"
"PARIS: No."
"RORY: Well, don't you think they'll find out?"
"PARIS: How?"
"RORY: Well, you not moving out might be a tip-off."
"PARIS: I'll get an apartment in Cambridge, buy a Harvard sweatshirt, talk about Mira Sorvino a lot. It's doable. I did tell my mother about having sex with Jamie, and her only reaction was to talk about how my father hasn't pleased her in fifteen years."
"RORY: Yikes."
"PARIS: Like I couldn't tell."
"RORY: And what's going on with your boyfriend?"
"PARIS: I haven't called him either."
"RORY: So the only people in your life right now work at General Hospital?"
"PARIS: This isn't General Hospital. I don't deserve General Hospital."
"RORY: Okay, you've got to stop doing this."
"PARIS: What happened? Harvard was my destiny. I was flipping through Harvard class schedules when you were still delighting to The Adventures of Gumby and Pokie."
"RORY: I was more of a Pee Wee Herman kind of gal."
"PARIS: It's partly my parents' fault, they didn't brand me properly. I should've been at the 92nd Street Y or Brick Church."
"RORY: Prep schools?"
"PARIS: Pre-schools. It decides everything. But I'm not totally blameless. I found a spot in my interview that I'm sure doomed me."
"RORY: You recorded your Harvard interview?"
"PARIS: The plan was to archive everything, then donate it to the university upon my demise. Little did I expect that my demise would come this early."
"[she presses play on a handheld tape recorder]"
"Paris: . . .shouldn't even be taken into account. This dovetails nicely into my feelings about population control. It's a little hot in here, can we do something about that? Anyway, population control has been dramatically successful in most European countries to the detriment of some, especially Italy, which is experiencing a marked drop "
"Interviewer: Do you think this has anything to do with "
"Paris: Whoa, whoa, just let me finish my thought here."
"Interviewer: But Paris. . ."
"Paris: Please!"
"[Paris stops the tape recorder]"
"RORY: Well, you said please, that's very polite."
"PARIS: I sound like a meth addict. I might as well record the new Justin Timberlake over this."
"RORY: I hate that you're torturing yourself like this, in bed like this."
"PARIS: Proust wrote all three thousand pages of In Search of Lost Time in bed. If it's good enough for him. [Rory grabs the remote and turns the TV off] Hey!"
"RORY: Bed is not a life plan, and you, my friend, need a life plan, so here it is. You need to tell your parents about Harvard. You need to start taking calls from people. You need to check the mail so that you can see the other millions of universities that have no doubt accepted you and that are probably dying to be in the Paris Gellar business. You need to call your boyfriend back because he's going to be worried about you and because none of this is his fault, and you need to start by getting the hell out of bed."
"PARIS: You did not just say ""be in the Paris Gellar business."""
"RORY: You know what I meant."
"PARIS: There is no alternative to Harvard."
"RORY: Except Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Stanford, Sarah Lawrence, et cetera, et cetera."
"PARIS: Well, maybe you're right."
"RORY: I'm unquestionably right."
"PARIS: But I'm not jumping up this second."
"RORY: You don't have to rush it."
"PARIS: And I'm going to have to keep watching this, at least until Adriana's wrongful conviction for aggravated as*ault is overturned."
"RORY: I understand."
"PARIS: Thanks."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks to the living room, where a little boy is on the couch]"
"LORELAI: You've got your remote, your water, your comic books. Looks like we've got you all set up here, Fred Junior."
"FRED JR: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Oh, ma'am. You make me feel old. Stop it."
"FRED JR: Yes, ma'am."
"LORELAI: No, I mean it, stop it."
"FRED JR: Okay."
"[Fred walks down the staircase]"
"FRED: I think we're out of toothpaste."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry, Fred. Below the sink there's plenty more."
"FRED: Oh, thank you. This is kind of fun."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it's fun having you guys."
"[Lorelai walks to Rory's room, where Rory's making the bed]"
"LORELAI: Aw, I would've done that."
"RORY: I feel weird now."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: About other people sleeping in my bed."
"LORELAI: Oh, honey, don't worry. Fred and his wife don't seem. . ."
"RORY: Don't seem what?"
"LORELAI: Like they're feeling extremely romantic."
"RORY: Oh, God, that didn't even cross my mind."
"LORELAI: You're kidding! That's all I would've thought of."
"RORY: Well, I'm thinking about it now, thank you very much."
"LORELAI: Got all your stuff for Lane's?"
"RORY: Yeah, it wasn't a hard packing job."
"[Lorelai glances at some of Rory's papers]"
"LORELAI: Wow, these have really changed."
"RORY: What have?"
"LORELAI: The pro/con lists. In all the hubbub, they slipped my mind. Yale."
"RORY: What about it?"
"LORELAI: Yale."
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: Yale."
"RORY: Stop saying Yale."
"LORELAI: It has double the pros of the other two."
"RORY: I wouldn't say double."
"LORELAI: Triple over filthy, dirty Princeton. It's kicking butt."
"RORY: But I'm not done collecting my data yet."
"LORELAI: You have a document the length of Nicholas Nickleby here. Looks like you're done."
"RORY: But. . ."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Look at my wall."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: So that wall says something."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it says the Harvard merchandising department made a nice chunk of change off of us."
"RORY: But how can I go to Yale with my wall looking like this?"
"LORELAI: It's a wall. Look, honey, Luke was right. The pro/con lists have to come to an end eventually."
"RORY: But Luke also reminded us that it was supposed to be Harvard regardless of a list. Everyone thinks that."
"LORELAI: I don't. I don't. I know I'm the one who said no to Yale loudly and a lot, but not anymore. Really, I just want what's right."
"RORY: I know, but it has to be right for both of us."
"LORELAI: If it's right for you, it's really right for me."
"RORY: But I don't want you to hate the place I'm going."
"LORELAI: Never."
"[Fred and his wife come to the doorway]"
"FRED: Oh. Uh, are you not ready for us yet?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, we're ready for you, Fred."
"FRED: We hate to put you out."
"RORY: No, it's perfectly okay."
"LORELAI: I'm guessing you two are gonna fall sound asleep the minute your heads hit that pillow."
"FRED: Oh yeah, we're exhausted."
"RORY: Have a good night."
"LORELAI: Yeah, guys, yell if you need anything. [quietly] I don't wanna hear you yelling for any other reason."
"RORY: Shh!"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Ah. So where's Jess tonight?"
"RORY: Working."
"LORELAI: He works a lot, doesn't he?"
"RORY: He's saving a lot, too."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: He wants a better car. The one he's got keeps stalling."
"LORELAI: And he's still working at Luke's, too, right?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: So is he down to part-time at school?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: Getting work credit or something?"
"RORY: No, he's going full time."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah?"
"RORY: Why do you say that?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. It's just, Wal-Mart, working at Luke's, squiring you around town. . .it just seems like a lot of his time's accounted for."
"RORY: Well, that's crazy. He's a senior, he's going to school full time."
"LORELAI: Just wondering."
"RORY: Rest."
"LORELAI: I'll try."
"RORY: And don't start the sock puppets with Fred Junior or he'll never let you stop. Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[As Rory walks out the back door, the doorbell rings; Lorelai walks toward the front door]"
"LORELAI: Excitement here never stops, Fred Junior."
"[Lorelai pulls open the door]"
"MR. HATLESTAD: Hi there."
"LORELAI: The Hatlestads, hi. I thought you went home."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Well, breakfast was so great and the town's so nice, and you made staying over sound so fun, that we decided to take you up on it."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Is that okay?"
"LORELAI: It's more than okay. Come on in, cause you're staying here."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Thank you. [they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Your bedroom's right upstairs, you can't miss it."
"MR. HATLESTAD: Terrific, thanks. [they start walking up the stairs]"
"LORELAI: How much room you take up on that couch there, Fred Junior?"
"FRED JR: Pretty much all of it."
"LORELAI: That's what I figured."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Rory and Lane are making up their cots in the store area]"
"RORY: So, who do you have staying in your room?"
"LANE: The second Poe and his wife."
"RORY: Well, for your sake, I hope they are very, very tired."
"LANE: Why?"
"[cell phone rings]"
"RORY: Nothing. I shouldn't have said anything. [answers phone] Hello?"
"LORELAI: I'm a nomad."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I am the lonely wanderer. Hank Williams would be too sad to write a song about me."
"RORY: Where are you?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm a Bedouin. I'm homeless!"
"RORY: Okay, stop with that. Where are you?"
"LORELAI: I'm walking aimlessly around town."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: The Hatlestads showed up."
"RORY: But they went home."
"LORELAI: Apparently I made the whole emergency fire accommodations sound so fun that they had second thoughts."
"RORY: You're a terrific salesman."
"LORELAI: And a terrific idiot."
"RORY: So where are you right this second?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm in the middle of the street, a.k.a. my bedroom."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I'm by the school, Luke's, that area."
"RORY: Luke's, good. Go there."
"LORELAI: It's closed."
"RORY: But Luke is upstairs."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"RORY: Ask him if you can stay."
"LORELAI: But "
"RORY: I bet the answer's yes."
"LORELAI: He'll make me eat a veggie burger!"
"RORY: Get moving."
"LORELAI: Fine. Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"[they hang up. Lorelai walks up to the diner and bangs on the door]"
"LORELAI: [yells] Luke! Luke! Stella!"
"[She throws a rock at his apartment window. Luke opens it and leans out]"
"LUKE: Who is that?"
"LORELAI: Lorelai."
"LUKE: What are you doing down there?"
"LORELAI: Enjoying some air, getting some exercise, and freezing."
"LUKE: Well, go home."
"LORELAI: Home? I have no home. Hunted, despised."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's from Ed Wood, the movie."
"LUKE: Have you gone bonkers?"
"LORELAI: People are bunking at my place and I need somewhere to stay."
"LUKE: And it just occurred to you now to look for a place?"
"LORELAI: The stupid Hatlestads showed up."
"LUKE: Who?"
"[A women leans out a nearby window]"
"MRS. SLUTSKY: Pipe down out there!"
"LUKE: Go back to bed, Mrs. Slutsky!"
"MRS. SLUTSKY: Don't talk to me that way, young man!"
"LORELAI: Throw your keys down."
"MRS. SLUTSKY: I will not!"
"LORELAI: No, Luke, Mrs. Slutsky."
"LUKE: I'll just come down."
"MRS. SLUTSKY: Do something!"
"LORELAI: Ditto."
"LUKE: I'm coming down."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Luke leaves the window. Lorelai and Mrs. Slutsky stare at each other]"
"LORELAI: My  my inn caught fire. [pause] Hurry, Luke."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Rory and Lane are sitting in their cots. Lane is on the phone]"
"LANE: No, Young Chui, it was right to break up with her. Why stay in a relationship when it's not going anywhere? . . .Life's too short, exactly. . . .No, I told you a joke last night, I need more time to come up with another one. . . Look, it's getting late. I got my math test tomorrow, I better go. . .Yeah, I'll call you to tell you how it went. . . Okay, night. [hangs up]"
"RORY: So Young Chui and his girlfriend are broken up, huh?"
"LANE: Yeah, and good riddance. She was very waspy."
"RORY: What about you and Young Chui? Are you broken up?"
"LANE: No, my mom still thinks we're the perfect young Korean couple."
"RORY: Weren't you supposed to be broken up by now?"
"LANE: Yeah, but Young Chui thinks it isn't time yet."
"RORY: Why? This is a fake relationship. You were never really going out."
"LANE: I don't know. I bring it up every night and he just changes the subject."
"RORY: You talk every night?"
"LANE: Pretty much. He's a little needy right now."
"RORY: That's a lot of talking."
"LANE: Well, we're friends."
"RORY: Just friends?"
"LANE: What are you getting at?"
"RORY: Just that he's calling you every night and he keeps putting off your break-up, so God knows when you'll be able to date Dave Rygalski. He's asking you to tell him jokes and to let him know how your math test went. . ."
"LANE: So?"
"RORY: So. . . it sounds like he's in love with you."
"LANE: No. No. Young Chui is not in love with me. And it's not for you to take an innocent friendship like Young Chui and I have, with its air of innocence and its. . .innocence. Oh my God, he loves me. That stupid boy's fallen in love with me!"
"RORY: It's not stupid. You're a catch."
"LANE: But not his catch, I'm Dave's catch. I've already been caught."
"RORY: You probably need to be more direct."
"LANE: That fool. And I can't break up with him or my mom will never let me date. It's gotta come from him. What do I do?"
"[Jess knocks on the window]"
"RORY: Just a second? [she walks over to the window and opens it]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Bizarro day, huh?"
"RORY: Wouldn't wanna repeat it."
"JESS: The inn's still closed?"
"RORY: Just til tomorrow."
"JESS: What caused it?"
"RORY: They're not sure. Something electrical, probably."
"JESS: That's usually the culprit. Something the matter?"
"RORY: No."
"JESS: Good."
"RORY: So how was school?"
"JESS: Same ol', same ol'."
"RORY: You're still doing okay?"
"JESS: Doing my reading, writing, and arithmetic."
"RORY: And you're still going, right?"
"JESS: What? Where's this coming from?"
"RORY: There's been speculation."
"JESS: From who?"
"RORY: My mom asked whether you're going full time to school."
"JESS: Your mom?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: Why's she so interested?"
"RORY: Because you're dating her daughter."
"JESS: Oh, great, what else does she think I did? Start the fire, put Phil Spector up to it?"
"RORY: I told her yes, you were going."
"JESS: Well, as they say on the Family Feud, good answer."
"RORY: So, I didn't lie to her?"
"JESS: No."
"RORY: No?"
"JESS: Look, don't worry, I got it under control."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: I'm going enough. I've been picking up some extra shifts here and there, but I'm fine. It's Mickey Mouse stuff anyway. What it takes the others hours to learn, it takes me minutes."
"RORY: Well, if you're behind. . ."
"JESS: I'm not behind."
"RORY: But if you get behind, I can help you catch up."
"JESS: Got it covered."
"RORY: If you say so."
"JESS: I do."
"RORY: Okay."
"JESS: So how bout you come out?"
"[Mrs. Kim walks into the room holding a bat]"
"MRS. KIM: What's this?"
"LANE: He was just leaving, Mama."
"MRS. KIM: Why is he here at all?"
"LANE: He came to borrow something. Here. [she picks up something from the table and walks it over to Jess]"
"JESS: Thank you. [to Mrs. Kim] Baseball bat?"
"MRS. KIM: Cricket."
"JESS: Night."
"[Jess leaves, Mrs. Kim locks the window]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Lorelai and Luke are making up the bed.]"
"LUKE: Oh, don't do that."
"LORELAI: Don't do what?"
"LUKE: Don't pull the sheet back after I pull it. I need more for this side."
"[they continue making the bed]"
"LUKE: You pulled it back again."
"LORELAI: Okay, I need it for my side."
"LUKE: I need it to tuck in."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"LUKE: I always tuck it in on this side."
"LORELAI: Let's tuck it in on both sides."
"LUKE: You tuck a bed in on both sides?"
"LORELAI: Yes, and then I slip down into it like I'm in a straitjacket or something."
"LUKE: Oh, you must feel right at home there."
"LORELAI: I so set you up for that."
"LUKE: Fine, tuck it in on your side."
"[Luke walks toward the couch]"
"LORELAI: You know, I really should take the couch. Me taking the bed doesn't feel right."
"LUKE: Oh, now, come on."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You b*at me into giving you the bed and pretending you don't want it now isn't working."
"LORELAI: I'm pretending to try to be polite."
"LUKE: I'm fine with the couch. You're the one that's exhausted."
"LORELAI: You know, I'm actually not."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: I'm, like, strangely exhilarated. I mean, as awful as what happened today was, I'm happy with how I handled it. You know, you never know how you're gonna react in situations like this until something happens and I think I did pretty well."
"LUKE: Yeah, I do, too."
"[the phone rings.]"
"LUKE: [answers] Hello? . . .oh, hey, Nicole, hi. . .Yeah, I'm good. . . Oh, not much. There was a fire at the local inn out here and. . .Yeah, the one she works at, yeah. . .Everybody's fine. Yeah, just a lot of chaos for awhile. So how was your thing today? . . . All right, fill me in tomorrow. . . Seven's good. . .Okay. . . Okay, yeah. . .Goodnight. [hangs up] That was Nicole."
"LORELAI: So I heard. Why didn't you tell her I was here?"
"LUKE: Didn't come up."
"LORELAI: You mean, she didn't out of the clear blue and for no reason ask you if I was sleeping over?"
"LUKE: Just didn't seem necessary."
"LORELAI: Well, you have nothing to hide here. You just took in a refugee."
"LUKE: I know there's nothing to hide. It's just that. . .you've kinda become a. . ."
"LORELAI: Become what?"
"LUKE: A sore point with me and Nicole."
"LORELAI: What, how?"
"LUKE: Well, on our first date, I was a little nervous and I wasn't having any luck coming up with topics, so I was just kinda blabbing a lot. And then she ordered extra fries at dinner, so it reminded me of you and I told her a quick story about you and French fries, and that seemed fine. And then later, she ordered a third cup of coffee. . ."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: And I mentioned you and your coffee thing, and I noticed that Nicole kind of reacted a little, and ever since then, she's been a little sensitive to the issue."
"LORELAI: Well, of course she is, Luke. You don't talk about another woman on a first date."
"LUKE: Even if it's just a friend?"
"LORELAI: They don't exist."
"LUKE: Come on."
"LORELAI: Not on a first date."
"LUKE: No other women exist on a first date, not even my mother?"
"LORELAI: Do you really think talking about your mother on a first date is wise?"
"LUKE: Not really."
"LORELAI: You can maybe mention a sister, maybe. And then you move on really, really quickly."
"LUKE: This is why I hate dating."
"LORELAI: Well, unless you wanna be Mountain Man all your life, you've got to abide by the rules and customs. Ooh, sorry, I have to get up super early tomorrow."
"LUKE: No problem. What time?"
"LORELAI: Six."
"LUKE: I get up at quarter to five every morning."
"LORELAI: Why in the world would you get up that early?"
"LUKE: I don't know, to run my business?"
"LORELAI: Well, change businesses. Ooh, wow, total déjà vu."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: It's the alarm clock. I had a dream once that you set eighteen alarm clocks to get me up, which is not a bad way to get me up."
"LUKE: Where were we?"
"LORELAI: We were, um, at my house. I got up, I went downstairs for coffee, and you talked to my stomach."
"LUKE: Why on earth I do that?"
"LORELAI: Well, because I was pregnant. Twins."
"LUKE: Mine?"
"LORELAI: What am I, dream tramp? Of course yours."
"LUKE: We were married?"
"LORELAI: Um, yeah. Did I not mention that?"
"LUKE: No. You know, you shouldn't drink coffee when you're pregnant."
"LORELAI: Uh, true."
"LUKE: It's probably why Rory's a caffeine addict."
"LORELAI: Right, you're right."
"LUKE: Dream go beyond that?"
"LORELAI: No. Um, you talked to my stomach and then you ki. . .well, no."
"LUKE: Oh, okay. Well. . .night."
"LORELAI: Yeah, night."
"CUT TO LATER THAT NIGHT"
"[Luke and Jess are snoring loudly. Lorelai has trouble sleeping, so she gets up and leaves]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory gets some coffee from the counter and sits down at a table with Lorelai]"
"RORY: Luke and Sookie have worked things out."
"LORELAI: There does seem to be a grudging respect thing going on."
"SOOKIE: Get the ricotta fritters started, guys. I wanna serve those first."
"LUKE: Hey, we making the Cajun Eggs Benedict again?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know, we could."
"LUKE: Let's do it, it was good."
"SOOKIE: Well, the Cajun was all your doing."
"LUKE: Only because I knocked the cayenne pepper into your hollandaise."
"SOOKIE: Hey, how do you think they invented the Reese's cup and penicillin, my friend? We can win the Nobel here."
"[Jess walks down from upstairs]"
"JESS: Morning."
"LUKE: You're up early."
"JESS: Gotta catch me that worm. See ya."
"LUKE: Where you off to?"
"JESS: School."
"LUKE: This early?"
"JESS: I got a lab project going on. Me and my team are meeting early."
"LUKE: Well, have a good day."
"JESS: If I have a choice. [walks over to Rory and Lorelai] Hey."
"LORELAI: Good morning."
"JESS: Talk to you later."
"RORY: Later."
"[Jess leaves; Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: By the way, your boyfriend snores."
"RORY: Didn't need to know that."
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello. . .it is?. . .oh, I love you, I love you. . .thanks. [hangs up] We're open. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention please. That was just Chief Baker on the phone who told me in that deep sexy voice of his that the inn is officially reopened. Uh, right now it's just me and the staffers, but soon, very soon, you will have your stuff back and you can go home."
"FRED: Thank you, Lorelai. Listen, from our group, we want to give you this. [hands her a stuffed raven]"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, that's the nicest dead bird I've ever gotten. Thanks, Fred."
"POE 2: It's from all of us."
"LORELAI: Right. Thank you Poe Society. Coming Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: I'm coming. Okay, you need to caramelize the hazelnuts for the brioche French toast, add some Madeira to the pear-poaching liquid and add some chives to the cream for the sheared eggs."
"LUKE: Don't burn anything, got it."
"RORY: I've gotta change for school."
"LORELAI: Go, go, we'll see you later."
"SOOKIE: Let's go."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Michel and Chief Baker are waiting on the porch as Lorelai and Sookie walk up]"
"MICHEL: Ah, here they are."
"LORELAI: Hi, Michel. Hi, Chief. Don't we love our chief?"
"SOOKIE: I bet he can b*at up all the other chiefs."
"LORELAI: For sure he can."
"MICHEL: Can we get on with this?"
"CHIEF BAKER: Let me just unlock the door here."
"LORELAI: Michel, the first thing I wanna do is get into all the rooms and get all the guests' stuff into the lobby and organized for them to pick up. Sookie, go to the kitchen and let me know what's what. Maybe we can open for dinner."
"CHIEF BAKER: Dinner?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"CHIEF BAKER: Anyone give you a heads up about what's inside?"
"LORELAI: No."
"CHIEF BAKER: You might wanna wait til you get inside to make your plans. And go slow."
"[Lorelai, Sookie and Michel enter the inn and survey the fire damage in the lobby. Meanwhile at Lorelai's house, Rory enters to find the Harvard paraphernalia on her bedroom walls has been replaced with Yale paraphernalia.]"

"OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Lorelai, Rory, and Emily are sitting at the dining room table]"
"EMILY: Richard, please, we are starving!"
"RICHARD: [calls from kitchen] I will be right there, Emily."
"EMILY: This is ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Mom, relax."
"EMILY: He woke up this morning and suddenly just had to have this dish that his grandmother would make him."
"LORELAI: Yeah, we all understand the cravings."
"RICHARD: [calls] It's a family secret."
"EMILY: Well, last time I checked, I was family."
"RORY: He's having fun, Grandma."
"EMILY: I saw an open can of cream of mushroom soup. Nothing good can come of that."
"[Richard walks in carrying a casserole dish]"
"RICHARD: Here we are, a treat for the masses."
"RORY: Smells good."
"RICHARD: Oh, this is my favorite thing to eat as a boy. My gran used to make this for me whenever I was feeling a little sad. You know, if my cricket team lost or a girl I fancied turned up her nose at me."
"LORELAI: Well, then load me up because there was this really cute chick at the pharmacy today. I used my best material on her and nothing."
"EMILY: Richard, at least let Pina serve it."
"LORELAI: No comment on my lesbian hilarity. My, how far we've come."
"RICHARD: Pina will serve tiny, proper servings. Johnny Machete needs to be presented in a heap."
"RORY: Johnny Machete?"
"EMILY: That's the name of this vile concoction."
"RORY: It's delicious."
"LORELAI: It's not bad."
"EMILY: It's twelve different colors."
"LORELAI: Come on, Mom, eat it."
"EMILY: It looks like someone already did."
"RICHARD: Emily."
"EMILY: I'm sorry. I'm happy you're happy, and to prove it, I will take exactly three bites of this before I throw it out."
"RICHARD: Thank you."
"EMILY: You're welcome."
"RICHARD: So, good food, good company. Now, let's move onto good conversation. Rory, what is new in your life?"
"RORY: Well, funny you should mention it. . ."
"LORELAI: Now?"
"RORY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Okay. Mom, Dad, we have some really big news."
"RORY: I got my college acceptance letters back."
"LORELAI: Harvard, Princeton, and Yale."
"RORY: And after giving it a lot of thought, I have decided. I'm going to Yale."
"LORELAI: Did you hear that  Yale!"
"RORY: I'm going to Yale!"
"LORELAI: That's where you went, Dad."
"RORY: You liked it, remember?"
"EMILY: Pass the Johnny Machete, please."
"LORELAI: Pass the. . ."
"RORY: I don't understand. I thought you wanted me to go to Yale."
"EMILY: No, we didn't."
"RICHARD: Absolutely not."
"EMILY: What gave you that idea?"
"LORELAI: Mom, Dad, look, I know we've had our differences over where Rory should go to school, but that's behind us now. She's going to Yale, and that's good. Really good."
"RORY: Nothing but smiles."
"LORELAI: We're both very happy about it."
"RORY: Both."
"LORELAI: Her and me."
"RORY: She and I."
"LORELAI: Everybody in this room named Lorelai is over the moon about the going to Yale.'"
"RORY: Which means that everybody else in this room not named Lorelai can be equally over the moon about the going to Yale.'"
"RICHARD: I'm getting the champagne."
"EMILY: I'm calling the Talbotts."
"RICHARD: Oh, make sure you gloat over that dimwitted son of theirs who couldn't even get into Brown."
"EMILY: She's going to Yale!"
"RICHARD: She's going to Yale!"
"[they start to walk away, then both turn back to kiss Rory]"
"RICHARD: When I get back, I'll teach you the fight song."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is in the lobby talking with the construction worker]"
"LORELAI: So?"
"TOM: It looks b*rned."
"LORELAI: Thank you. How long to make it not looked b*rned?"
"TOM: Uh, geez, maybe two "
"LORELAI: Tom, let me help you out. The answer I'm looking for is ten days because that's when I have to get guests back in here again."
"TOM: Okay, ten days."
"LORELAI: Are you lying to me?"
"TOM: What's the answer you're looking for there?"
"LORELAI: Never mind, just go fast."
"TOM: Go fast, huh? Never heard that one before."
"[Sookie walks over]"
"SOOKIE: Well, everything's fine in the kitchen. We just have to get the gas line reconnected."
"LORELAI: How long's that gonna take?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. The plumber's in there now looking at everything."
"[Michel walks over]"
"MICHEL: We forgot to call the Rappaports and they showed up."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, what did you do?"
"MICHEL: Well, luckily they are not too bright so I convinced them they got their days mixed up and I sent them home."
"LORELAI: You sent them home? You didn't even try to get them a room somewhere else?"
"MICHEL: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: [to worker] Hey Laura, try to track down the Rappaports and see if you can get them into the Bunnyhop Inn. Thanks. [to Michel and Sookie] Okay, grab a seat and let's get the meeting started."
"[a man walks into the lobby]"
"TOBIN: I'm here, I brought bagels."
"LORELAI: Oh, Tobin, great. I'm starving."
"TOBIN: Normally I wouldn't think of it, because what bagel stands a chance next to Sookie's magical muffins and scones?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, Tobin, stop!"
"TOBIN: Two full pants sizes, my friend, all because of you."
"MICHEL: What is he doing here? He is the night manager  it's day."
"LORELAI: Michel, this is an emergency staff meeting, I need him here."
"MICHEL: I told you I cannot be in the same room with him."
"LORELAI: It's an hour out of your life, deal with it."
"TOBIN: Hold it. In case of soot. [spreads a handkerchief on the seat of Lorelai's chair]"
"LORELAI: You're very sweet."
"TOBIN: Wait, wait. [wipes off the back of Lorelai's chair] Let's let the dry cleaners drum up their own business, huh?"
"[Tobin starts to sit down]"
"MICHEL: My chair!"
"TOBIN: Oh, I'm sorry. [sits in another chair]"
"[Michel sits down and scoots his chair close to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so, should we get a room or what?"
"MICHEL: Will you just start your meeting?"
"LORELAI: All right. Here's the situation."
"TOBIN: Excuse me, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"TOBIN: Michel, did you get a bagel?"
"MICHEL: I don't want a bagel."
"TOBIN: Are you sure? They're Kosher."
"MICHEL: I don't eat bagels. Bagels are like glue in your intestines and ensure that everything that enters your body will remain there until you die."
"SOOKIE: Ew, shut up."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's focus. As you know, the fire pretty much wiped out the dining room and five of the upstairs rooms."
"[Tobin sighs]"
"LORELAI: Tobin, are you okay?"
"TOBIN: I'm sorry, I just. . .I just love this place so much. I've been the night manager here for five years and I've spent so much time walking these halls, listening for friendly ghosts flying around, playing "
"MICHEL: Make a point, bagel boy."
"TOBIN: It just hurts me to see it wounded, that's all."
"LORELAI: Well, it won't be wounded forever. We will rebuild and we'll be back and better than ever. We just need to keep it going until then. So I need some ideas on what to do."
"TOBIN: You know, I was thinking. . .I'm sorry, may I?"
"MICHEL: No."
"LORELAI: Go ahead."
"TOBIN: Well, if we could get a celebrity in here, that would generate a lot of publicity."
"LORELAI: Hm. But how could we get a celebrity in here?"
"TOBIN: I know Tony Randall and Renee Estevez. I'd be happy to put in a call."
"MICHEL: Okay. Look, I hate to bring this up, especially since  I mean, how do you top Renee Estevez? But we have a small number of rooms, yes?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"MICHEL: And the lobby's fine, and Sookie can make certain things at home  muffins, baked goods, jams, et cetera."
"LORELAI: So?"
"MICHEL: So that's breakfast, and we have beds, and if we add some free wine and cheese around five in the afternoon. . ."
"LORELAI: Uh, no. We're not becoming a bed and breakfast. Who's next?"
"MICHEL: You're being stubborn."
"LORELAI: Bed and breakfasts are cutesy and annoying."
"SOOKIE: It forces people to mingle."
"LORELAI: I do not support the mingling."
"MICHEL: Adding a little gimmick will be an incentive for people to keep their reservations."
"TOBIN: You know what, I hate to say it, not being a B&B man myself, but Michel is making sense."
"MICHEL: Get off my side immediately."
"LORELAI: All right, I'll consider it."
"MICHEL: Sure, if he says it, you will consider it."
"[Tom walks over]"
"TOM: I gotta show you something."
"LORELAI: Is it bad?"
"TOM: No, it's great. You're gonna be thrilled, really. Warm up, cartwheels are coming."
"LORELAI: Keep talking. Be right back."
"[Lorelai starts following Tom. Tobin walks up to her]"
"TOBIN: Excuse me, Lorelai? Listen, I know you're crazed right now, but I also remembered that your birthday is coming up on Friday, and well, I got you a little something."
"LORELAI: Oh, you didn't have to do that."
"TOBIN: It's very small."
"LORELAI: Tobin, I love candles."
"TOBIN: And it's scented, cappuccino."
"LORELAI: God, that smells great."
"TOBIN: I'm really glad you like it."
"LORELAI: I do, thanks."
"TOBIN: And listen, I'm the night manager here and I'm very proud to be the night manager, but with everything so wacky crazy around here right now, if you need some extra help during the day, please call me."
"LORELAI: I may take you up on that offer, Tobin. Thanks."
"[Lorelai walks away. Michel and Tobin share a look]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the stairs into the living room]"
"LORELAI: Stairs squeak."
"RORY: Stairs squeak."
"LORELAI: There's a chip on the banister."
"RORY: Chip on the banister."
"LORELAI: The paint's chipped in the archway, and there's a board loose in the entryway. Ooh, and the chimney needs to be swept."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Luke cannot sweep our chimney."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"RORY: Because you need to be a chimney sweep to sweep a chimney."
"LORELAI: Please. If Dick van d*ke can do it, so can Luke."
"RORY: Luke is going to be very sorry he ever made this offer to you."
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke has given me five free hours of handyman work for my birthday for the last five years."
"RORY: And you have grossly exploited that gift every year for the past four years."
"LORELAI: Well, I need to make up for that first year where I didn't milk it like I should've."
"RORY: The spirit of giving is completely lost on you."
"LORELAI: But the spirit of getting is alive and well and it wants its chimney swept. Ooh, put down laundry, too."
"RORY: Fine, then can he also build me another bookshelf?"
"LORELAI: I've never been prouder of you than I am right at this moment."
"[the phone rings]"
"RORY: And tell him to paint little flowers on it."
"LORELAI: Cause he's so good with the florals."
"[Lorelai walks toward the kitchen as Rory answers the phone]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"PARIS: I finished the paper on Dickinson, the Physics test was for a third grader, and I picked the history of the Egyptian political process as my International History project."
"RORY: You've been very busy."
"PARIS: I've been very bored."
"RORY: When are you coming back to school?"
"PARIS: My parents return tomorrow. I think my mom's bringing home a new face."
"RORY: Really?"
"PARIS: There's a doctor in France who injects some kind of gel into your head and then molds it to give you better cheekbones."
"RORY: You are kidding me."
"PARIS: She has to sleep on her back for a month, otherwise her face will flatten like a crepe."
"RORY: Oh my God, it's Brazil."
"PARIS: Anyway, I'll probably have to go back to school when they get home, so. . ."
"RORY: It will be fine."
"PARIS: Are people still talking about my meltdown speech?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Great."
"RORY: Who cares what they're saying, Paris?"
"PARIS: Just give me more homework, it will keep my mind off my life."
"RORY: There is no more homework. In fact, I think you've almost finished your first year of college."
"PARIS: Well, I just can't sit here thinking. I'll go crazy."
"RORY: Why don't you go out and do something fun?"
"PARIS: Like what?"
"RORY: I don't know, but it's your last day of freedom. Go be wild. Go crazy. Don't think, just do."
"PARIS: Do what?"
"RORY: You're thinking."
"PARIS: But "
"RORY: Still thinking."
"PARIS: What if "
"RORY: Paris, don't think."
"PARIS: Okay, I won't think."
"RORY: I'll see you tomorrow."
"[hangs up and walks to the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Hey, do you think Luke can knock this wall out and build us a bigger kitchen in five hours?"
"RORY: You'll have to drop the laundry."
"LORELAI: Never mind. Oh my God, I'm exhausted."
"RORY: Are you too exhausted to talk about birthday week?"
"LORELAI: I'm never too tired to talk about birthday week."
"RORY: Okay, so, Monday I thought we'd start with facials at Sloopy's after school."
"LORELAI: Mudpack Monday, I love it."
"RORY: Then we'll have double feature Tuesday, Sephora Wednesday, complimentary makeover Thursday, and then, big fat fabulous Friday."
"LORELAI: D-day!"
"RORY: BD-day!"
"LORELAI: Culminating in the fabulous blowout of a party you're planning."
"RORY: Oh, I'm sorry, you wanted a party? I told everyone you didn't wanna make a big deal out of your birthday this year."
"LORELAI: You're not funny."
"RORY: Miss Patty and Babette wanted to hire these two hot guys to carry you around all day and feed you Bon-Bons, and Kirk wanted to hire the Red Hot Chili Peppers to play a concert in the square, but I said, Hey, please respect the lady's wishes. She deserves that at her age."
"LORELAI: Why are you so cruel to Mama?"
"RORY: I have to go."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"RORY: None of your business."
"LORELAI: You are planning something for Friday night, aren't you?"
"RORY: I'll bring back Chinese for dinner."
"LORELAI: And you tell people no matter what they say, I just couldn't accept a new car. It would be beneath me and I'd be completely humiliated. And a convertible would just make me fling myself off a building."
"[the phone rings]"
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"[Rory leaves]"
"LORELAI: [answers phone] Hello?"
"KAREN: Lorelai Gilmore?"
"LORELAI: You got her."
"KAREN: I'm calling from Richard Gilmore's office."
"LORELAI: Never heard of him."
"KAREN: Richard Gilmore, your father."
"LORELAI: Oh, tall, bow tie?"
"KAREN: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm with you now, go ahead."
"KAREN: Okay. Well, he'd like to set up an appointment to meet you for coffee. Would tomorrow work for you? Two o'clock?"
"LORELAI: Well "
"RICHARD: Make it three, Karen. I have that conference call at two."
"LORELAI: Is that my father?"
"KAREN: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Put him on the phone, please."
"KAREN: But "
"LORELAI: Hand it over, honey."
"KAREN: I -"
"LORELAI: Come on, let's go, chop chop."
"RICHARD: What are you doing?"
"KAREN: She wants to talk to you."
"RICHARD: Just tell her I'll meet her tomorrow."
"KAREN: I tried, it didn't work."
"RICHARD: But I pay you to make my appointments."
"LORELAI: Dad!"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, hello."
"LORELAI: Are you telling me that you were sitting right next to this woman while she called me?"
"RICHARD: She is my secretary, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You were sitting right there?"
"RICHARD: This is the way a proper business is conducted."
"LORELAI: Two feet from the phone?"
"RICHARD: I'm not going to argue with you. Are you available tomorrow or not?"
"LORELAI: What is this Dad?"
"RICHARD: I have something I need to discuss with you."
"LORELAI: Well, discuss it now."
"RICHARD: I don't have the time now."
"LORELAI: Well, put Mrs. Huh-wiggins on the phone. Have her tell me."
"RICHARD: Please, Lorelai, can you meet me tomorrow at three o'clock or not?"
"LORELAI: Fine, where?"
"RICHARD: I will have Karen call you tomorrow to confirm it and tell you the place."
"LORELAI: Why can't you just tell me now?"
"RICHARD: Leave me just a semblance of my structure, please."
"LORELAI: Fine. I'll talk to the woman sitting right next to you tomorrow."
"CUT TO WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Rory is at the counter placing an order]"
"FRAN: So, that's a four foot chocolate cake with individual vanilla cupcakes on top spelling out Happy 16th Birthday Lorelai?"
"RORY: That's right."
"FRAN: Would you like butter cream or whipped cream frosting on that?"
"RORY: Can you do both?"
"FRAN: That's a lot of frosting."
"RORY: I know, but it's my mom's favorite part. Once we tried to make a cake entirely out of frosting, which turned out to be better in theory than in actual execution."
"FRAN: Well, both frostings it is then. What time do you want to pick it up?"
"RORY: Miss Patty will pick it up around five."
"FRAN: All right, you're all set."
"RORY: Thanks, Fran."
"[Lane walks in]"
"LANE: We have a glitch."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: Well, apparently, the world's largest pizza was 122 feet, 8 inches."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: It says it right there."
"RORY: Well, obviously we can't do that."
"LANE: Obviously."
"RORY: So, then, we'll have to make it the largest pizza in Connecticut."
"LANE: Actually, Litchfield made one last year that was 98 feet."
"RORY: Pete said the biggest they could do was a twelve footer."
"LANE: Maybe you could make her the world's biggest something else."
"RORY: Like what?"
"LANE: I don't know. Taco?"
"RORY: I think the world's biggest taco would be a little difficult to serve, don't you?"
"LANE: Well, it would definitely be more of a commitment."
"RORY: We'll just have to tell her it's the world's biggest pizza."
"LANE: Lie to her on her birthday?"
"RORY: It's for her own good. So, how's the music selection coming?"
"LANE: Good. I've decided to choose one song from each year in Lorelai's life. I'm almost done, though I've hit a snag in 1974."
"RORY: Bad year?"
"LANE: It's making the year of the Macarena look inspired."
"[Rory and Lane come out of the bakery and start walking down the street]"
"RORY: Hey, can you stash this at your house til the party? It's just favors and stuff. [hands Lane some shopping bags]"
"LANE: Ironic, isn't it? You having to hide things at my house for a change."
"RORY: Life has come full circle. [they run into Jess walking out of the video store]"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: I got the video for tonight."
"RORY: What'd you get?"
"JESS: Almost Famous."
"RORY: No, not again."
"JESS: I can't help it, I'm addicted."
"RORY: Fine, but if I'm going to spend two hours sitting there watching Kate Hudson commit su1c1de again, then we are ordering Indian food."
"JESS: Oh, come on."
"RORY: Hey, last night when we watched Ed Wood we got burgers like you wanted to."
"JESS: Okay, fine  tonight, Indian food, but tomorrow, Saturday Night Fever and Thai food."
"LANE: That's so cute. You're like a really sweet old agoraphobic couple."
"JESS: Thank you very much."
"LANE: Okay, I've gotta go. Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"[Lane leaves. Rory and Jess walk down the street]"
"JESS: So, it's been a couple days since you made the big decision. You still going to Yale?"
"RORY: Yes, I am. It's got all the classes I want and some really great teachers, and plus, you know, as an added bonus, it's really close to here."
"JESS: 22.8 miles."
"RORY: How'd you know that?"
"JESS: Do you Yahoo?"
"RORY: You looked it up?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"RORY: You looked it up."
"JESS: I just hit a couple buttons on the computer."
"RORY: You looked it up."
"JESS: I was bored. There was nothing on TV and I was fooling around, it was something to do, that's it."
"RORY: You looked it up."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Taylor and Nicole are sitting at a table going over some paperwork]"
"TAYLOR: I'd like the wording to be a little harsher."
"NICOLE: Taylor, it already says that if Aunt Tilly's Taffy delivers even two hours late, they forfeit all payment for that particular shipment and are liable for any loss of income that may result from that late delivery. It's pretty extreme."
"TAYLOR: Well, it may seem extreme, but these candy people are shifty characters."
"NICOLE: Why don't we leave the wording like it is for now and see how things go? We can always get tougher later if necessary."
"LUKE: Yeah, you can send over a couple of Oompa Loompas to kick the crap out of Aunt Tilly."
"TAYLOR: Are you still dating him?"
"NICOLE: Yes, I am."
"TAYLOR: Why?"
"NICOLE: Oh, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: I mean, if you're lonely, I have a nephew I would love to introduce to you. He just got back from a three-year stint in a biosphere in Arizona. Can I give him your number?"
"LUKE: No."
"TAYLOR: I'm not talking to you."
"LUKE: It's my lucky day. Is he done?"
"TAYLOR: All right, fine. We'll leave it your way and see how it works out. [leaves]"
"LUKE: So, listen, after I dispose of Taylor's body, are we hitting a movie tonight?"
"NICOLE: Yeah, we are."
"LUKE: Okay."
"NICOLE: Uh, Luke, could you sit for a second, please?"
"LUKE: I could."
"NICOLE: Could you do it soon?"
"LUKE: Okay, listen, if I sit down, are we gonna have the conversation?"
"NICOLE: The conversation?"
"LUKE: Yeah, you know, the conversation."
"NICOLE: Luke, please."
"LUKE: Here comes the conversation."
"NICOLE: My parents are coming into town and I am going to have lunch with them and I thought maybe you'd like to join me."
"LUKE: Join you?"
"NICOLE: What do you say?"
"LUKE: It's not that I don't wanna meet your parents, it's just that I haven't met any parents for a long time."
"NICOLE: Well, you don't have to. I'm just giving you the option."
"JESS: Jeez, man, just meet her parents already."
"LUKE: Do you mind?"
"JESS: So what if they hate you? You've been there before."
"NICOLE: You know what, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you on the spot."
"LUKE: I'm not on the spot. Really, I'm completely off the spot. I'm spotless. Uh, what time's the lunch?"
"NICOLE: Two o'clock on Thursday."
"LUKE: Two o'clock on Thursday. Okay, two o'clock on Thursday, I'll be there."
"NICOLE: That's great. So I'll see you tonight?"
"LUKE: I'll see you tonight."
"[Nicole leaves]"
"JESS: I have to go."
"LUKE: Where?"
"JESS: School."
"LUKE: Oh, school, okay. Well, have a good day. . .at school."
"JESS: I will."
"[Jess leaves. Luke walks outside and watches him. Jess walks toward the school, then jogs to his car and drives off]"
"CUT TO CHILTON CLASSROOM"
"[Students are talking as they wait for class to start]"
"MADELINE: Mills College."
"LOUISE: Isn't that the one where all those girls with bad hair cried because they were gonna let boys in?"
"MADELINE: Yes."
"LOUISE: And why are you going there?"
"MADELINE: It's the one that took me."
"LOUISE: But why'd you apply?"
"MADELINE: I needed a fallback option."
"LOUISE: Well, fall back, baby, right into some big mama's loving arms."
"MADELINE: Ooh, how depressing. Let's talk about you, did you decide?"
"LOUISE: Last night."
"MADELINE: Brandeis?"
"LOUISE: Tulane."
"MADELINE: The Big Easy."
"LOUISE: Enough said."
"[Paris walks in with a bandage on her nose]"
"RORY: Oh, Paris, hi, you're back. I. . .oh my God. What happened to your nose?"
"MADELINE: You had it done."
"LOUISE: Finally."
"PARIS: I did not have it done."
"RORY: Did you fall?"
"PARIS: No, I didn't fall. I had it pierced."
"MADELINE: You what?"
"LOUISE: Oh my God."
"RORY: Why would you do that?"
"PARIS: Because you told me to go out and do something crazy."
"RORY: Yes, but I meant have some ice cream, go see three movies, buy a new purse. I didn't mean go poke a third hold in your nose."
"PARIS: Well, I didn't buy a new purse, I pierced my nose. And within an hour of having it done, my nose swelled up to four times its normal size, blocking all nasal passage, making it impossible to breathe. I went to the emergency room, where they pried the thing out of my nose and sh*t me up with antibiotics. I spent the night with an ice pack strapped to my face."
"RORY: Oh, Paris."
"PARIS: It seems that I was allergic to the crap metal hoop that I paid $19.95 to have jammed into my nose."
"LOUISE: Did you take a picture?"
"PARIS: No, Louise, I did not take a picture. I was a little busy trying to get air to my brain cells, a burden you've not yet faced."
"RORY: Paris, I'm so sorry. I . . [cell phone rings]. . .I didn't. . . [answers phone] Hello?"
"PETE: Rorino, good, I caught ya. Okay, there's a bit of a design flaw in the pizza here."
"RORY: What kind of design flaw?"
"PETE: I'm a little concerned that the crust is not gonna be able to support all the toppings we talked about. We might need to put in a second crust."
"RORY: A second crust?"
"PETE: About three-quarters of the way in, sort of like a retaining wall."
"RORY: What about just making the crust thicker?"
"PETE: Okay, we're brainstorming, I got it. A thicker crust, a thicker crust, that might do it. Uh, let me noodle around with that for awhile and get back to you."
"RORY: Okay. Bye Pete. [hangs up]"
"PARIS: [to boy] I will not let you look at my nose for ten dollars, you sick job. b*at it, now! Come back when you have a twenty. [to Rory] What? Just making lemonade here."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[There's a knock at the back door.]"
"LORELAI: I'm coming!"
"[Lorelai walks to the kitchen, where she finds the table decorated with cookies spelling out Happy Birthday Lorelai'.]"
"LORELAI: Aw! [there's another knock] Coming."
"[She answers the door, Luke walks in with his toolbox]"
"LORELAI: Hiya."
"LUKE: Your slave is here."
"LORELAI: And where's the French maid outfit I requested?"
"LUKE: I've got it on under the plaid."
"LORELAI: So what else is new?"
"LUKE: So, how does it feel to be a year older?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm not a year older until Friday, Fifi."
"[Lorelai eats a cookie from the table.]"
"LUKE: What the hell is this?"
"LORELAI: My birthday Mallomars."
"LUKE: She says like I should just know this."
"LORELAI: Here's your list. [hands him a notepad]"
"LUKE: What's wrong with the garbage disposal?"
"LORELAI: It's not disposing."
"[Luke reaches into the sink and pulls out a spoon]"
"LUKE: Next."
"LORELAI: You're so good!"
"[Lorelai pulls a box of Mallomars out of the cupboard]"
"LUKE: Did you ever consider the possibility of just pulling the spoon out yourself?"
"LORELAI: I did consider it, yes. Do you wanna start upstairs or down? Cause there's actually more to do upstairs this time for some reason."
"[Lorelai takes a Mallomar out of the box and puts it on the table]"
"LUKE: What'd you just do?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You put the cookie down."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: You ate the cookie, and then you took a cookie out of the box and put it where the cookie you just ate was."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: Well, that's nuts."
"LORELAI: Rory made this for me, I don't wanna ruin it."
"LUKE: Then why'd you eat the cookie?"
"LORELAI: Cause I wanted a Mallomar."
"LUKE: But why didn't you just eat one out of the box?"
"LORELAI: Cause this one was right here. The box was all the way in the cupboard."
"LUKE: But you had to go to the cupboard to get the box to replace the cookie you ate off the table."
"LORELAI: So?"
"LUKE: Looking at the list now. Okay, stairs, gutters, da-duh-da-duh-da, electrical outlet. Which one?"
"LORELAI: In the bathroom."
"LUKE: By the sink or by the bathtub?"
"LORELAI: Bathtub."
"LUKE: Okay. So, I can do most of this list today, but, uh, I can't put up the towel rack until later. I didn't bring my drill."
"LORELAI: Heh "
"LUKE: Dirty, yes, I know."
"LORELAI: Um, that's okay, I'll be here tomorrow afternoon if you wanna come by then."
"LUKE: I can't tomorrow, I'm having lunch with Nicole's parents."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: They're coming into town."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: So Nicole thought I should meet them."
"LORELAI: Makes sense."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, you know, we've been seeing each other fairly regular now, so. . .makes sense."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I think it's great."
"LUKE: Yeah, I do, too. I should get started upstairs. By the way. . ."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You were right about Jess."
"LORELAI: What about Jess?"
"LUKE: He's not going to school."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"LUKE: Yup. I watched him head right toward the school and when he thought no one was watching him, he got in his car and drove off. So I got in my truck and followed him."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"LUKE: To Wal-Mart."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: He's been lying to me this whole time."
"LORELAI: What are you gonna do?"
"LUKE: I'm gonna tell him that I know what he's been doing, remind him that we had an agreement, that he's supposed to go to school, that he's supposed to graduate from school, and then. . .I'm gonna tell him I know what he's been doing."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, Luke."
"LUKE: Yeah, well. I'm gonna be upstairs."
"LORELAI: Okay. Call if you need anything."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE THE MARKET"
"[Rory wheels a cart full of soda cases out of the market. Jackson walks up to her.]"
"JACKSON: Rory!"
"RORY: Hey, Jackson. Listen, could you "
"JACKSON: What do you think you're doing?"
"RORY: Oh, well, I'm trying to transport all the sodas for the party in one trip, which seemed a little silly when I first come up with the idea and it's rapidly growing in its stupidity."
"JACKSON: You know, I never took you for being thoughtless, but I guess I was wrong."
"RORY: What are you talking about? I got the sugarless Red Bull just like you like."
"JACKSON: You really hurt Sookie, you know that?"
"RORY: Why, what did I do?"
"JACKSON: What did you do, what did you do? Hm, let me see, what did you do?"
"RORY: Uh, Jackson, if you could stop moving around, it'd be a lot easier."
"JACKSON: You know, I just heard you're making the world's largest pizza for Lorelai's birthday party, is that true?"
"RORY: Yes."
"JACKSON: And it doesn't occur to you to consult Sookie?"
"RORY: Oh. Oh no."
"JACKSON: The woman is a gourmet chef and Lorelai's best friend in the world, and you don't include her in this?"
"RORY: But Sookie's an artist  pizzas didn't really seem to be her thing."
"JACKSON: Everything's her thing, young lady."
"RORY: Jackson, I swear, I would never purposely hurt Sookie. Besides, it's not the world's largest pizza. It's not even the tri-county area's largest pizza."
"JACKSON: I have a sobbing pregnant woman at home, which is not unusual, except this time I didn't cause it!"
"RORY: I'm so, so sorry."
"JACKSON: And by the way, there wouldn't happen to be vegetables on that pizza, would there?"
"RORY: Well. . ."
"JACKSON: Because I don't know if you got the memo or not, but I happen to be a produce man."
"RORY: And a darn good one at that."
"JACKSON: Yet, I don't remember a call asking me to handle the vegetables. Was there a call? Did I just miss it? Was I out?"
"RORY: Well, you see, the veggies were included in the price, so it just. . ."
"JACKSON: Hm. [storms off]"
"RORY: Jackson, I'm sorry!"
"JACKSON: I hope you and your world's largest pizza will be very happy together!"
"RORY: It's not the largest pizza in the world! We may b*at Woodbridge, but that's it, I swear!"

"CUT TO RESTAURANT"
"[Lorelai is sitting at a table. Richard walks in and sits down with her]"
"RICHARD: Sorry, sorry, sorry."
"LORELAI: Everything okay?"
"RICHARD: Oh, yes. I just had a few calls to make that took up a bit more time than I had anticipated. Have you been here long?"
"LORELAI: Twenty minutes and two pieces of pie."
"RICHARD: Amazing. Well, then, let's get right down to it, shall we?"
"[a waitress walks over]"
"WAITRESS: Can I get you something to drink?"
"RICHARD: Uh, iced tea, please."
"WAITRESS: Another cup of coffee, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Thanks, Sarie."
"[the waitress leaves]"
"RICHARD: So, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: So, Dad."
"RICHARD: I appreciate you taking the time out to meet me like this."
"LORELAI: And I appreciate you actually showing up and not sending your secretary."
"RICHARD: I assume you're wondering why I asked you here."
"LORELAI: Not at all."
"RICHARD: Well, I have something for you. [places an envelope on the table]"
"LORELAI: Is it a hat?"
"RICHARD: No."
"LORELAI: Is it a purse?"
"RICHARD: No."
"LORELAI: Horse?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: George Foreman Grill?"
"RICHARD: When you were born, I decided to celebrate, so as soon as your mother went to sleep, I left the hospital, I called my business manager and I made a real estate investment."
"LORELAI: You do know how to party, don't you?"
"RICHARD: I made this investment in your name."
"LORELAI: Wow, most people just buy a stuffed bear. This is better."
"RICHARD: I thought so. Anyhow, a little while ago, I got a letter from a lawyer who is representing the investment group informing me that the government is building a road right through the middle of your investment."
"LORELAI: Sad."
"RICHARD: Which means that the complex has been sold and all the investors will be receiving a check."
"LORELAI: Happy."
"RICHARD: Since you are one of the investors. . ."
"LORELAI: I get a check?"
"RICHARD: You get a check."
"LORELAI: Wow! That's. . .[opens the envelope] Seventy-five thousand dollars?"
"RICHARD: Yes, it is."
"LORELAI: I get seventy-five thousand dollars for being born?"
"RICHARD: I thought it would be a pleasant surprise."
"LORELAI: This is seventy-five thousand dollars. Seventy-five. . .do you have a pen?"
"RICHARD: Why, yes, I do."
"LORELAI: Seventy-five thousand dollars. Seventy-five thousand dollars. Oh my God, that's like 150 pairs of Jimmy Choos."
"RICHARD: What are Jimmy Choos?"
"LORELAI: Shoes."
"RICHARD: 150 pairs, that's it?"
"LORELAI: Dad, they're Jimmy Choos."
"RICHARD: For seventy-five thousand dollars, you should be able to buy at least three or four hundred pairs of shoes."
"LORELAI: Not Jimmy Choos."
"RICHARD: But that's ridiculous. You are not going to spend seventy-five thousand dollars on Jimmy Choos when you could buy four hundred pairs of less prestigious but I'm sure equally stylish shoes. You will shop around first. Is that clear?"
"LORELAI: Yes, sir."
"RICHARD: All right, then. It's settled."
"LORELAI: Listen, Dad, this money isn't, um. . ."
"RICHARD: Isn't what?"
"LORELAI: It isn't some kind of gift, is it?"
"RICHARD: Gift?"
"LORELAI: Like a birthday gift. Because if it is, it's too much and I can't "
"RICHARD: This isn't a gift. I made this investment in your name. You received a check, that's the way these things work. Legally, I'm obligated to give you that. This isn't charity or generosity, it is the law."
"LORELAI: It's the law that I get to keep seventy-five thousand dollars."
"RICHARD: Enjoy the shoes."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the floor by the coffee table]"
"LORELAI: We could buy a boat."
"RORY: We could, but why?"
"LORELAI: Because rich people always have a boat."
"RORY: We could park it in the front yard."
"LORELAI: Yeah, like white trash rich people."
"RORY: God, this is amazing. No more clipping coupons."
"LORELAI: No more picking loose change up from the ground. No more driving around looking for cheap gas."
"RORY: Which totally defeats the purpose since you wind up using more gas looking for the cheap gas."
"LORELAI: Seventy-five thousand dollars. I feel so rich. And suddenly in complete agreement with everything Bush has to say."
"[the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: I'll get it."
"RORY: No!"
"LORELAI: Ah, more secret birthday calls."
"RORY: Not everything is about you. It could be Jess."
"LORELAI: It's about me."
"RORY: It could be Lane."
"LORELAI: It's about me."
"RORY: It could be Paris, it could be Madeline, it could be Louise, it could be a myriad of other people wanting only to talk to me about me."
"LORELAI: It's about me."
"[Rory takes the phone to her room]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"PETE: Rory, we got a big problemo."
"RORY: What's the matter, Pete?"
"PETE: We did a trial run of the pizza. You know, just wanna make sure everything was right there for the big day, you know."
"RORY: I appreciate that."
"PETE: So we made a trial pizza, and Kirk built a pizza rack on top of his car, you with me?"
"RORY: Like a bad habit, Pete."
"PETE: So as Kirk's putting the pizza on the rack, the thing collapses, the pizza slips, long story short  Kirk has got some severe cheese burns."
"RORY: Oh my God, is he all right?"
"KIRK: Ow."
"PETE: Who knows? The point is. . ."
"KIRK: Oh."
"PETE: I think the pizza needs to be cheeseless."
"RORY: What?"
"PETE: And possibly sauceless."
"RORY: Pete."
"PETE: The thing's a hazard, babe."
"RORY: Pete, did it ever occur to you that the problem may not be the pizza, it may be Kirk?"
"PETE: Did not occur to me."
"RORY: Well, it should have."
"PETE: Okay."
"RORY: The pizza has to have cheese and sauce, otherwise, it's not a pizza. It's bread."
"PETE: Okay, look, if you're gonna insist on the cheese and the sauce, you're gonna have to provide the transportation yourself."
"RORY: Fine, Pete, I will figure something out."
"PETE: Roger wilco, senorita."
"[They hang up. Lorelai opens Rory's bedroom door]"
"LORELAI: Who was it?"
"RORY: Astrid from school. She's leaving for Europe for a week and she wants me to take notes and email her everything. She's afraid she's gonna fall behind."
"LORELAI: It was about me."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke is sitting at the table when Jess walks in]"
"JESS: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey. You're home late."
"JESS: Traffic."
"LUKE: Traffic, right, okay. So, you hungry?"
"JESS: I'm meeting Rory."
"LUKE: Want me to make you guys some sandwiches?"
"JESS: So we can brown bag it on our date? I don't think so."
"LUKE: Just offering. How was work?"
"JESS: The cleaned-up version of The Eminem Show seems to be selling pretty well, so the world is basically coming to an end."
"LUKE: So listen, I, um, wanna talk to you about something."
"JESS: Talk."
"LUKE: Could you stop grooming for just a second please?"
"JESS: I'm already late."
"LUKE: Look, I was doing some thinking about your situation."
"JESS: My situation?"
"LUKE: Yeah, you know, you're working here, you're working at Wal-Mart, you're dating Rory, going to school. It just seems like a lot. You ever worry that if a bird flies into your head it might never get out again?"
"JESS: I've got everything under control."
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm sure you do. I just thought maybe I could make things a little easier."
"JESS: How?"
"LUKE: Well, I could, uh, give you a raise at the diner."
"JESS: A raise?"
"LUKE: Yeah. And maybe help out with some of the, you know, bigger money burdens, like your car insurance."
"JESS: Why would you wanna do that?"
"LUKE: So you can quit your job at Wal-Mart."
"JESS: No way."
"LUKE: But you'd still be making money, and this way, you'd get to spend more time on Rory and school."
"JESS: I'm fine."
"LUKE: Jess, come on."
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: Jess, just take the deal."
"JESS: I have to change."
"LUKE: I know you're not going to school."
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: I saw you get in your car and drive off."
"JESS: You spying on me?"
"LUKE: You lied to me!"
"JESS: Once in awhile I take an extra shift, it's nothing."
"LUKE: You have to go to school, Jess."
"JESS: I go enough."
"LUKE: What does that mean?"
"JESS: It means I go enough. It's public school. My history teacher is also the football coach, get the picture?"
"LUKE: Jess, we had a deal. You go to school, you graduate."
"JESS: I know. Relax. I got it all under control. I have to change."
"LUKE: Jess."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai is on the phone at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: That's right, breakfast is included. Then at five, we invite all the guests to the lobby for complimentary wine and cheese and mingling. . . Yes, it is kind of like a B&B. . . Okay, great. We'll see you and Sweetie then. Bye."
"[She hangs up, then walks over to a table where Tobin is standing with some staffers]"
"TOBIN: Any thoughts? So, as you know, we have to get this place up and running as quickly as possible for as little money as possible. So last night I pulled out the old Time Life series, and I have to admit, there's some pretty terrific ideas in here. For example, we can putty up the cracks in the drywall and then give the lower part of the wall a good coat of paint. Then we can take a strip of wallpaper, put it around the top, thus creating sort of a border, if you will. Also, I gathered up all the broken China from the dining room because I read here in Martha that chipped teacups make great votive holders, and we all know, when in doubt, it's candles, candles, candles, right? So I cleaned them up, filled them with tealights, and I think they look terrific. Oh, the pieces that were too far gone to save, I just smashed them up and used the pieces to make this nice picture frame."
"LORELAI: Ah, that's a great idea, Tobin, really."
"MICHEL: Uh, Lorelai. I have a little something for you."
"LORELAI: For me?"
"MICHEL: Yes. I wasn't sure it would get here in time since I ordered it from Madrid, but thank God it made it. Happy birthday. [hands her a gift bag]"
"LORELAI: You bought me a present?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"LORELAI: You've never bought me a present."
"MICHEL: I have, too."
"LORELAI: Not once in the five years I've known you have you ever "
"MICHEL: Just open up the bag, please."
"[Lorelai pulls a journal out of the bag]"
"LORELAI: Oh, Michel, it's beautiful."
"MICHEL: Yes, well, I wanted it to be special, you know. Not just some knick- knack you could pick up at the supermarket or the car wash."
"LORELAI: Well, it's great. I love it. I must say, I feel very spoiled. A beautiful day book, cappuccino candle."
"TOBIN: Oh, that reminds me, I got you something else. [walks over to the front desk]"
"LORELAI: What? Tobin, you already gave me a gift."
"TOBIN: No, that was a pre-gift."
"MICHEL: A what?"
"TOBIN: Hold on. [to Michel] Why don't you scooch just a little bit for me?"
"[Tobin retrieves a bag from behind the desk, then hands it to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Tobin, this is too much."
"TOBIN: Yes, it is, but I saw it and it just screamed Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay, well. . .God, this is exciting. I love my birthday."
"TOBIN: I hope it fits."
"MICHEL: Fits?"
"[Lorelai pulls a leather jacket out of the bag]"
"LORELAI: Tobin, it's amazing."
"TOBIN: That is the jacket that Joe Strummer wore during the 1979 Pearl Harbor tour."
"LORELAI: No."
"TOBIN: Yes."
"MICHEL: Who is Joe Strummer?"
"LORELAI: Tell me you're kidding."
"MICHEL: Who is Joe Strummer?"
"LORELAI: You did not get me this."
"MICHEL: Is he a Hell's Angel man?"
"TOBIN: Joe Strummer is from The Clash."
"LORELAI: The Clash is a band."
"TOBIN: And a band is a "
"MICHEL: I know what a band is."
"LORELAI: He just died, and Rory and Lane have been in mourning for months, and now I have his jacket. And, oh my God, this is by far the coolest thing I have ever gotten. God. Oh, smell it, it smells like Joe."
"MICHEL: Well, this is wonderful, to smell like a dead guy. You'll have to b*at them off with a stick."
"TOBIN: And there's a letter of authenticity in the bag, and a picture of Joe wearing the jacket, and also, they threw in a beret just for the heck of it."
"LORELAI: Tobin, you are getting a hug!"
"TOBIN: Well, I'd fight it, but what's the point, right?"
"MICHEL: I have to run an errand."
"LORELAI: Why, where you going?"
"MICHEL: Just be here when I get back."
"LORELAI: Oh, I just love this jacket."
"CUT TO LEAHY RESIDENCE"
"[Luke and Nicole are sitting across from Nicole's parents in the living room]"
"MR. LEAHY: Nicole, you're being "
"NICOLE: I am not being stubborn."
"MR. LEAHY: You didn't let me get the stubborn out."
"MRS. LEAHY: Luke, would you like a blini?"
"LUKE: No, thank you."
"MR. LEAHY: When you sign up to become a surrogate mother, you enter into a business agreement, and the rules of business should apply. You as a lawyer should understand that."
"NICOLE: As a lawyer, I do understand that. As a human being, I also understand that when a woman's alone "
"MR. LEAHY: Here we go."
"NICOLE: And in need of money, can do things that she'll later regret."
"MRS. LEAHY: I could get you some cheese."
"NICOLE: You cannot force a mother to give up her child."
"MR. LEAHY: If she signed a paper saying, On April the 12th I am giving birth and whatever comes out, I'm handing to you. . ."
"NICOLE: What a lovely way to put that."
"MR. LEAHY: And you pay her money and her medical expenses. . ."
"MRS. LEAHY: They always do this. They pick a subject and they argue until dinner, then they call a truce and they pick it back up for dessert. I could get you some nuts."
"NICOLE: Okay, enough. I don't wanna argue with you anymore."
"MR. LEAHY: What can I do with her, Luke? I ask you."
"LUKE: Oh, well, uh, probably not much."
"MRS. LEAHY: So Luke, I feel like we've been ignoring you."
"LUKE: Oh, that's okay."
"MRS. LEAHY: Nicole told us you've never been married."
"NICOLE: Or we could talk about how he owns his own diner. That's a good opening topic."
"MRS. LEAHY: Hush, sweetheart. You just sit there and pretend to be ashamed of us."
"LUKE: Uh, no, I have never been married."
"MRS. LEAHY: But someday, maybe, right? Marriage, children?"
"NICOLE: She means eventually and with the woman of your choice. They will not be involved in the picking."
"MRS. LEAHY: Because there is nothing more wonderful than marriage."
"NICOLE: You know, the others escaped out the bathroom window. Just a tip."
"MRS. LEAHY: And then children. Well, there's nothing more rewarding than children. You just can't imagine until you've been there."
"MR. LEAHY: That's true. And this one here made everything in life worth it."
"MRS. LEAHY: The whole experience is like the most fabulous roller coaster ride you can imagine. From the time they're born to that first step. The first word. The first time they hug you. The first time they pick out their own outfits."
"LUKE: The first time they tell you they're going to school and then you follow them, and they get in their car and drive to Wal-Mart."
"MR. LEAHY: Wal-Mart?"
"LUKE: And they think you don't know. They think you're just a moron and you're going, Hey, they must be telling me the truth, right? And they don't think that maybe you know that they're lying to your face and that you're really mad because you guys had an agreement."
"MRS. LEAHY: Oh dear."
"LUKE: And that agreement was clear, very clear. And they know that breaking that agreement is a violation of everything you had talked about. Oh yeah, that is cute. That's just darling. I can't wait to experience that again. [pause] I'm sorry, did someone mention cheese?"
"CUT TO PIZZA SHOP"
"[Rory walks in. Kirk, Joe and Pete are at a table]"
"RORY: Hey guys."
"PETE: Rory, good, just the lady we're looking for. We have a plan."
"RORY: Good, cause I've got a check."
"PETE: We've solved the problem of transporting the big pizza thing."
"KIRK: I was of little help since I'm currently in excruciating pain."
"PETE: Instead of this whole one huge pizza concept, we're gonna do a hundred little pizzas all sitting next to each other."
"RORY: What?"
"JOE: Like a pizza doily."
"RORY: I don't want a pizza doily."
"PETE: Okay, less a doily, more of a collage."
"RORY: I don't want a pizza collage either."
"JOE: Hey guys, I got another idea. How about we put the pizzas together, and then put pepperonis over the open spots."
"PETE: So it looks like one big pizza, tricky."
"RORY: Okay, hold on."
"JOE: Or we could put cheese over the holes."
"KIRK: Please don't say the C- word."
"RORY: Guys."
"PETE: Cheese might fall through the holes."
"JOE: We can use slices."
"PETE: That'll work."
"RORY: That will not work!"
"PETE: Hey, Rory."
"RORY: No. Now you three listen to me. We agreed that this was going to be the world's largest pizza. That was the concept. Now I realize it can't be the world's largest pizza because that pizza was insane, but it is still going to be large. Very large. Crazy large."
"PETE: But we "
"RORY: No buts! That was the concept  get back to the concept! This is not Gangs of New York now with Cameron Diaz. This is Gangs of New York twenty years ago with Meryl Streep as Scorsese originally imagined it. Come back, refocus, remember the goal. Am I making myself clear?"
"JOE: Cameron Diaz is hot."
"RORY: Not the point, Joe."
"JOE: Okay, jeez."
"RORY: Now tonight is my mother's birthday party and the whole town is going to be there and they are expecting music, favors, and a really large pizza and they will not be disappointed. I don't care how you do it, just do it!"
"KIRK: Somehow I can't picture Meryl Streep with Leonardo Dicaprio."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is behind the counter on the phone]"
"LUKE: I really am sorry, Nicole. Your parents must think I'm a lunatic."
"NICOLE: No, I don't think lunatic was one of the words they used. But they have a very extensive vocabulary, so there may just not have been time."
"LUKE: It's the first time I meet them and I just. . .Jess was driving me crazy and. . ."
"NICOLE: I know this. I told them this."
"LUKE: I swear, when they come back into town, I will do better."
"JESS: I'm going to school. [leaves]"
"NICOLE: They may not be back in town for several months."
"LUKE: Whenever."
"NICOLE: Whenever? So I can make another lunch date with my parents even though it's several months away?"
"LUKE: Sure, make it."
"NICOLE: Okay, I'll make it."
"LUKE: Tell them I've gotten some medication, I'm much better now."
"NICOLE: I'll do that."
"[Jess walks back into the diner]"
"JESS: Get off the phone!"
"LUKE: What?"
"JESS: I need the phone, get off the phone!"
"LUKE: What's the matter?"
"JESS: Someone stole my car."
"LUKE: Nicole, I'm gonna have to call you back. [hangs up] What do you mean somebody stole your car?"
"[Jess picks up the phone and starts dialing]"
"JESS: I parked it right around the corner and now it's gone."
"LUKE: Why would you park it around the corner?"
"JESS: Because that's where I parked it. How the hell can the police department have an answering machine? [hangs up the phone]"
"LUKE: Look, let's just calm down."
"JESS: Who would steal that car? It hardly ran."
"LUKE: Well, you know these chop shops, they can make a buck out of anything."
"JESS: I am gonna k*ll whoever did this. I'm gonna find them and k*ll them."
"LUKE: Listen, just go on over to school, I'll take care of anything."
"JESS: No, I gotta talk to the cops."
"LUKE: I'll do that, go. You know, you don't wanna be late to your first class, right?"
"JESS: Well, yeah, but "
"LUKE: I mean, you were planning on going to school, right?"
"JESS: Right."
"LUKE: Okay, well, then just walk on over to school and I'll take care of the rest."
"JESS: Fine."
"LUKE: All right, have a good day. Study hard, don't worry. Just leave the car to me."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Emily, Richard, Rory and the maids sing Happy Birthday to Lorelai in the dining room]"
"ALL: [singing] Happy birthday dear Lorelai, happy birthday to you."
"EMILY: You can take the cake into the kitchen now, Teresa."
"[the maid takes the cake away]"
"LORELAI: Wait, aren't I supposed to blow them out?"
"EMILY: Oh, Teresa can do that."
"LORELAI: Mom, it's tradition for the person whose name is on the cake to do the blowing."
"EMILY: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought only children liked to do that. Should we bring it back out and relight it?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RICHARD: Well, would you like to make a wish and blow out the tapers?"
"LORELAI: Why am I being mocked on my birthday?"
"RORY: Because that's the Gilmore way."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"EMILY: Let's move into the living room for our dessert, shall we?"
"LORELAI: Let's shall."
"[they all start walking to the living room]"
"LORELAI: [quietly to Rory] How're we doing on time?"
"RORY: We've got time for cake."
"LORELAI: Are you sure? Cause I don't wanna miss the fancy party you're throwing me."
"RORY: Don't worry, it's not that fancy."
"EMILY: What are the two of you whispering about?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"RICHARD: Champagne?"
"LORELAI: Trying to get me drunk so I forget that you wouldn't let me blow out my own candles?"
"EMILY: Oh, dear, is this going to be another one of those stories that you tell people for the rest of your life like the bunny story?"
"LORELAI: His name was Murray, Mom."
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily, you had to bring that up."
"LORELAI: How could you think I wouldn't notice you gave away my rabbit?"
"EMILY: Because you were four and terrified of the thing."
"LORELAI: I was not terrified, I simply respected his space."
"RICHARD: You slept in the maid's room for a week."
"LORELAI: I wonder where Murray is now."
"RICHARD: In a shoebox somewhere, I assume."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"LORELAI: Very nice, and on my birthday."
"RICHARD: Once again, a toast to Lorelai on her 36th birthday."
"LORELAI: 35th."
"RICHARD: Really?"
"LORELAI: You're doing the math?"
"RICHARD: Right, sorry. To Lorelai on her 35th birthday."
"RORY: Hear, hear."
"LORELAI: Thank you for the toast, thank you for the dinner, and, uh, in the spirit of the evening  Mom, I have something for you."
"EMILY: For me? It's not my birthday."
"LORELAI: I know, but here. [hands Emily an envelope]"
"RICHARD: Oh."
"EMILY: What is this?"
"LORELAI: It's from Murray. It's taken him this long to write it partially cause of the hurt and pain and partially cause he has paws."
"EMILY: What is this?"
"LORELAI: That is what I owe you."
"EMILY: What you owe me?"
"LORELAI: For Rory's school. I promised you I'd pay you back and now I have, every cent. Thank you again for helping us out. There's no way Rory would be going to Yale if it wasn't for this money, if it wasn't for you."
"EMILY: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: Okay, so. . ."
"EMILY: You must be very relieved."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: Your debt is paid, you owe us nothing."
"LORELAI: Well, yeah."
"EMILY: You don't need us anymore."
"LORELAI: Um, I didn't say "
"EMILY: You don't have to deal with us. You don't have to come over for Friday night dinners. It all works out beautifully, doesn't it?"
"LORELAI: This isn't about that, Mom."
"EMILY: Oh no?"
"LORELAI: No, I owed you money and I paid you back."
"EMILY: I don't want it."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you're mad that I'm paying you back."
"EMILY: I'm not mad, I just think it's extremely unkind of you to use this occasion to inform me you won't be coming over anymore."
"LORELAI: I didn't say that."
"EMILY: This says that!"
"LORELAI: Mom, let me ask you something  wouldn't you rather we came over here because we wanted to, not because of some threat you're holding over our heads?"
"EMILY: Oh, and you would come here voluntarily?"
"LORELAI: I always said I would pay you back. This is not a surprise."
"EMILY: No, it certainly isn't."
"LORELAI: I was trying to do a good thing here. When Dad gave me the money, one of the first things that jumped into my head was to -"
"EMILY: When Dad gave you the money? When Dad gave her the money?"
"RICHARD: Now, Emily "
"EMILY: You gave her this?"
"RICHARD: It was her money."
"LORELAI: It was from that investment, Mom."
"RICHARD: I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of this."
"LORELAI: Why are you mad at me?"
"RICHARD: I told you not to tell your mother about that money."
"LORELAI: When did you tell me that?"
"RICHARD: At lunch."
"LORELAI: You did not."
"RICHARD: I did, too."
"LORELAI: Dad, I swear you didn't tell me not to tell Mom."
"RICHARD: Why do you think I met you in the day at a restaurant, Lorelai? Think."
"LORELAI: I "
"EMILY: You kept this from me, Richard?"
"RICHARD: I knew you would be upset."
"EMILY: You lied to me."
"RICHARD: I had to give it to her. I was legally obligated."
"EMILY: You're also legally obligated to your wife."
"LORELAI: Mom "
"EMILY: Don't you talk to me!"
"RICHARD: Now, you're overreacting."
"EMILY: Don't you talk to me either!"
"LORELAI: Don't be mad at Dad."
"RICHARD: Stay out of this!"
"LORELAI: I just "
"RICHARD: Well, don't!"
"LORELAI: Mom, please. Just because I gave you this money doesn't mean we're never gonna come over here again. We will come over. Maybe not every week, but there will be the occasional Friday night dinners."
"EMILY: No, there won't."
"RORY: Grandma "
"EMILY: I don't need anybody doing me any favors. You are released from your obligation, Lorelai. Have a nice birthday, have a nice life, I'm going to bed."
"LORELAI: Dad "
"RICHARD: Not now!"
"[Emily and Richard leave the room]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking through the town square]"
"LORELAI: You're quiet. I know they were upset, hon, but trust me, they'll calm down."
"RORY: Why did you do that?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Just giving them that check like that."
"LORELAI: Rory, I borrowed that money."
"RORY: I know you did, but you had to have known that they'd get upset. You had to know that Grandma would take it personally."
"LORELAI: Well, what would you have me do, not pay them back?"
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Maybe?"
"RORY: Well, they didn't want the money back."
"LORELAI: It's not the point."
"RORY: Well, it's kind of the point."
"LORELAI: No, Rory, it's not the point at all."
"RORY: They were throwing you a party, Mom."
"LORELAI: Sorry, did I miss something? Did I dance around saying nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah when I gave her the check?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Did, did I not thank her  genuinely thank her for everything?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Did I not credit your getting into Yale with them giving us that money?"
"RORY: Yes, but "
"LORELAI: Unh uh, no buts. Listen Rory, I'm not sure if you're aware of how hard it has been for me these past three years to be indebted to my parents. I decided a long time ago that I was gonna live my life without their help, but I went to them and I took their money and I'm not sorry I did, it was the right thing for you, but I don't need their help anymore."
"RORY: Fine, but you don't have to just throw it in their faces like that."
"LORELAI: I paid back a loan. You're supposed to pay back a loan. I have Polonius and then entire banking system on my side."
"RORY: I just think you could've done it differently."
"LORELAI: How?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Take a sh*t."
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Rory, my relationship with my parents is very different from your relationship with them. You only know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily, and I only want you to know the warm and fuzzy Richard and Emily because they're your grandparents and they love you, but I have a different history with them and it was not all warm and it was definitely not all fuzzy. So do not judge me for repaying a loan that I always intended to repay, that I told them from the beginning I would repay, that I had to repay. I will not let them make me feel guilty for doing that and I will not let you make me feel guilty for doing that either."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: It's okay."
"[They walk down the street some more. Lorelai sees a large group of people gathered for her birthday party at the dance studio. A crane is lowering the huge pizza onto a table]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. What is that?"
"RORY: The world's largest pizza. Almost."
"LORELAI: That is amazing."
"RORY: You like it?"
"LORELAI: I love it. Thank you honey. Hey, what happened to Kirk?"

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the couch]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I know! How about . . .no."
"RORY: No, no, you can't keep doing that. You can't just start a thought and then say no. Finish them or don't start them at all."
"LORELAI: You're very totalitarian today."
"RORY: No, it just drives me crazy. It's like if you do ""shave and a haircut"" without the last part, you know?"
"LORELAI: Come on, do it."
"RORY: Will you stop giving me half-finished thoughts?"
"LORELAI: I promise. Come on, do it."
"RORY: Two bits."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"RORY: Now what were you thinking?"
"LORELAI: Pizza and TV."
"RORY: That's our fallback."
"LORELAI: That's why I said not, I remembered it was our fallback."
"RORY: When did we become so old and pathetic?"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, we're neither. We're momentarily stuck on what to do tonight."
"RORY: It's a Friday night. We should be out, I don't know, partying with the homies."
"LORELAI: Our Stars Hollow homies are all in bed by now."
"RORY: Not Kirk. He'll be playing video trivia at the pizza place. We could go and watch."
"LORELAI: Okay, we're old and pathetic. How did it come to this?"
"RORY: Well, it's our first Friday night that we haven't had to go to Grandma and Grandpa's for dinner."
"LORELAI: I cannot for the life of me remember what we did before we started doing those."
"RORY: It feels like a million years ago."
"[Rory walks over to get the phone]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, who are you calling?"
"RORY: It just feels weird for me not even to say hello to them on a Friday night."
"LORELAI: No, don't call them."
"RORY: Hey, this rift is between you and them. I'm still on friendly terms."
"LORELAI: I know, it's just that they're probably sitting there eating alone, shivering in an unheated room, the only illumination a single light bulb just so they can make us feel spectacularly guilty at the thought."
"RORY: [on phone] Hey Grandpa, it's Rory. . . Rory."
"LORELAI: He's pretending not to remember you?"
"RORY: No, it's loud there."
"LORELAI: Loud?"
"RORY: What's going on there?"
"RICHARD: Oh, we're having a party."
"RORY: A party?"
"LORELAI: A party?"
"RICHARD: Sort of a last minute thing. Couldn't get too big a crowd here. I think we wound up with 55 or 60, something like that."
"RORY: 60 people."
"RICHARD: Oh, here come the mushroom caps everybody!"
"RORY: There's singing and mushroom caps."
"LORELAI: I am appalled by this."
"RORY: Sounds like a lot of fun."
"RICHARD: Oh, it is. Oh, now, your grandmother would come and say hello, but she's in the next room dancing with Lloyd Sandstone. Watch where you put those hands, Lloyd."
"RORY: A guy named Lloyd is feeling up Grandma."
"LORELAI: You're making this up."
"RORY: Well, um, I'll let you go, okay?"
"RICHARD: Okay. Now, you're coming to visit after school on Monday, aren't ya?"
"RORY: Yes, I'll see you then."
"RICHARD: Ah, can't wait. Bye now."
"[they hang up]"
"RORY: The Gilmore house is partying like it's 1999."
"LORELAI: And here it's ""At Home with The 700 Club."""
"RORY: Well, we didn't tell them to stop living their lives."
"LORELAI: How could they bounce back so quickly?"
"RORY: I don't know, but bounce they did."
"LORELAI: Okay, they win this time. But we've gotta think of something super big and fantastic and cool for next Friday night, okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Now think."
"RORY: Mushroom caps sound really good."
"LORELAI: Sh."
"RORY: Sorry."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is sitting at the counter playing with her camera. Rory walks in]"
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Say cheese. [takes a picture] I love my little digital camera. I wanna marry it."
"RORY: Do you ever wanna put it away?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you'll hurt little DigitalDan's feelings."
"RORY: Sorry, D.D."
"LORELAI: [takes another picture] Gotcha! Oh, no, wait. Oh, missed. [to customer next to Rory] Got a good one of you, though. Nice cheekbones."
"RORY: So, could you focus on something non-photographic for a second?"
"LORELAI: Aw, I'll try."
"RORY: I was asked to pass this along to you. [hands Lorelai an envelope]"
"LORELAI: Something from Chilton? You've been dipping girls' hair in the inkwells again?"
"RORY: Read it and see."
"LORELAI: [reads letter] ""Dear Ms. Gilmore, with your daughter's final days of Chilton fast approaching, yours are, too."" Hm, not feeling the love here. Yadda, yadda, yadda. ""The Booster Club could use your help. We would greatly appreciate - "" Greatly's underlined three times. Trying to emphasize the word there. Got it, guys. Thanks. "" - your involvement, especially in light of your previous paucity of participation."" Ooh, they got me with alliteration and an obscure word."
"RORY: The bastards."
"LORELAI: I've been summoned to duty."
"RORY: Sounds like it."
"LORELAI: I feel like I should pack my rucksack, kiss my loved ones goodbye."
"RORY: So, don't do it, then."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you're as good as outta there. Yale's grabbed you. It's too late. We don't need anything from Chilton."
"RORY: Except my graduation tickets."
"LORELAI: We already got 'em."
"RORY: But we need extras. I just put in the request, and it's up to them now."
"LORELAI: So we do need one kind of big thing."
"RORY: And then there's my diploma."
"LORELAI: You'll get your diploma at graduation."
"RORY: No, I get my diploma holder at graduation."
"LORELAI: Do you think they would withhold your diploma based on my participation paucity?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Oh man, I'm screwed. I guess I gotta do it."
"[Luke walks over]"
"LUKE: Hey guys."
"[Lorelai takes a picture of him]"
"LUKE: Was that necessary?"
"LORELAI: Oh man, you do not photograph well."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: You've been getting some sleep, brother? 'Cause that's forty miles bad running."
"LUKE: I wasn't ready. Plus, it was a bad angle. Plus, this is a harsh light. A soft light would help with the thing with the eyes."
"LORELAI: Look who knows what light he looks best in."
"LUKE: You ready to order?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna take a picture of the menu and then order off the camera."
"LUKE: Yell when she's tired of the thing."
"RORY: Give it time."
"LORELAI: Now I'm gonna zoom in on just the breakfast meats."
"RORY: Go to town."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S GARAGE"
"[The band is practicing. Rory and Jess are watching]"
"ZACH: Whoa, cool."
"DAVE: We all finished at the same time."
"LANE: That has never happened."
"BRIAN: The middle of that song didn't even sound like us."
"DAVE: Yeah, it sounded good."
"RORY: It sounded great, guys. All of it. Didn't it?"
"JESS: Not too shabby."
"DAVE: We are so ready for this gig."
"LANE: We've got a gig. I just love the sound of that."
"JESS: Where is it?"
"LANE: Kyle from school. His parents are going to Marriage Encounter for the weekend so he's throwing this mondo party."
"JESS: You got enough songs?"
"DAVE: We have enough for two half-hour sets. What we need is a name."
"BRIAN: I made my suggestion."
"ZACH: Yeah, and we vetoed ""The Harry Potters."" Next."
"BRIAN: So yours is better?"
"ZACH: ""Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert"" is memorable and classy."
"BRIAN: I run out of breath every time I say it."
"ZACH: You've got asthma, dude. You run out of breath saying your name."
"DAVE: Yeah, Brian, we can't work our name around your respiratory illnesses."
"BRIAN: Even without an inhaler, ""Follow Them to the Edge of the Dessert"" is too long."
"ZACH: Yeah, but when we get famous, our fans will shorten it to FTTTEOTD."
"DAVE: Do you guys have any suggestions?"
"RORY: Oh, we wouldn't dare."
"BRIAN: Hey Lane, how are you gonna play a party like this with your mom being so strict?"
"LANE: Easy. Rory and Jess are gonna deliver my drums to Kyle's house for me, then my friend Young Chui is going to pick me up to take me to a fictional Seventh Day Adventist bowling party that will conveniently last the length of our gig."
"ZACH: Nice going."
"BRIAN: I've got my own ball and shoes."
"ZACH: Dude, don't tell people that."
"RORY: See you guys."
"JESS: Yeah, see ya."
"BAND: Bye."
"BRIAN: How about ""The We""?"
"ZACH: We?"
"BRIAN: Yeah. We are ""The We."""
"ZACH: I can't talk about this anymore."
"[Rory and Jess walk out of the garage]"
"RORY: So, any word on your car?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"RORY: You'd think someone would've found it. It was pretty one of a kind."
"JESS: It's probably holed up in some chop shop. Say goodbye, it's gone. Whatever. Let's talk about something else."
"RORY: I like that you're getting to know Dave a little."
"JESS: Yeah, he's a cool guy."
"RORY: Good. It's going to make the four of us going to prom together even more fun."
"JESS: Ah, yes, I almost forgot about the prom."
"RORY: No, you were trying to forget about the prom."
"JESS: I agreed to go and I am a man of my word."
"RORY: How's that arm I twisted?"
"JESS: I got the feeling back in it."
"RORY: It's just if there was one more dance I wanna go to in my whole life, it'd be the Stars Hollow High prom, with Lane. That's a big part of it."
"JESS: I'm getting the tickets this week."
"RORY: And I'll pay, okay?"
"JESS: Not a chance."
"RORY: It means a tux, you know. I know it's geeky."
"JESS: Tuxes are also James Bond. That's not geeky."
"RORY: You're kind."
"JESS: And going to stash a change of clothes in the limo."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN"
"[Luke is on the floor examining the wall behind the stove as Sookie looks on. Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: I need love and a hug. I just had to lay off Julio."
"SOOKIE: Oh, poor thing."
"LORELAI: That's the third one today. All I'm doing is crushing people's spirits."
"SOOKIE: But you told them that we all love them and will hire them back as soon as all the repairs are done."
"LORELAI: And I gave them their severance checks and they were all very gracious, which made it that much harder."
"SOOKIE: We're gonna get 'em back. It'll all be good again."
"LORELAI: I had to lay off Frank, too, but I just couldn't do another one, so Michel offered to do it."
"SOOKIE: Did he say he'd be nice?"
"LORELAI: Yes, and then he skipped off to do it."
"SOOKIE: Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: So, what's going on with Luke here?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. I've been keeping my distance because of what happened."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"SOOKIE: Well, he was lying on the floor pretty much like that, tinkering with stuff back there, and I got down and leaned in to see what he was doing, and after a while, I realized that the whole time, my hand was on his butt."
"LORELAI: Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: It was an accident."
"LORELAI: It's getting very Cinemax at night in here."
"SOOKIE: It was embarrassing."
"LORELAI: Uh huh. So, how was it?"
"SOOKIE: His butt?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: It's got a nice shape to it."
"LUKE: Will you two stop talking about my butt?"
"LORELAI: It's all positive."
"LUKE: And in bad taste."
"[Luke walks over to them]"
"LORELAI: We'll just talk about it after you leave."
"LUKE: Which is now, because I'm done."
"LORELAI: So what's the prognosis?"
"LUKE: It's the same as what the stove company told you. The wall back here is b*rned from the fire. You're gonna have to rebuild the whole thing before you can even think of reconnecting the gas. It's gonna take awhile, sorry."
"LORELAI: No, Luke, thanks for doing this. It's exactly what the contractor said. We just wanted a guy with a good butt's opinion."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, Tom has a terrible butt."
"LUKE: Please stop that."
"LORELAI: So Rory and I will see you Saturday for breakfast?"
"LUKE: Actually, you won't. Nicole and I are going skiing and we're getting a ridiculously early start."
"LORELAI: That sounds fun. Why ridiculously early?"
"LUKE: Because she has to drive in from her place in New York first because she can't stay at my place because of Jess."
"LORELAI: Hey, if you want, why don't you have her come in Friday night, you guys can stay here at the inn. It'll be on the house."
"LUKE: Nah, that's okay."
"LORELAI: No, do it, Luke. I mean, I know we have rooms available, and it's my way of saying thanks for parading that nice butt around here."
"LUKE: Geez."
"LORELAI: No kidding, really, it's a great butt."
"LUKE: Stop it."
"LORELAI: No, really, it's no problem."
"LUKE: Well, I don't know, maybe. Either way, thank for the offer."
"LORELAI: All right. I'll tell Michel to keep a room available in case you decide to do it."
"LUKE: Okay. See ya."
"LORELAI: Thanks, bye."
"[Luke leaves, Michel walks in]"
"MICHEL: Did you know that Frank rescues Chow puppies?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"MICHEL: He feeds and houses them on his own dime 'til he finds an owner. We can't fire him. And they are so cute. [shows her a picture] Chin-Chin and Pau-Pau. Pau-Pau's the one with the squatty little nose. I took them both."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay, good job."
"MICHEL: I have to go buy dog food. Will you fire Frank for me?"
"LORELAI: Sure thing."
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Lorelai is at a Booster Club meeting]"
"TERRY: With that last function, we raised just enough to put us in the black, which got the school controller off our back, which is going to make our last endeavor that much easier."
"CARRIE: Haven't we already talked all this stuff to death?"
"TERRY: Yes, but we need to fill in our last minute Booster Club add-ons here."
"LORELAI: You get the scary threatening letter?"
"DOUG: Yup."
"TERRY: So, onto Grad Night, our last event of the year."
"JOAN: God, this year's gone by fast."
"CARRIE: I can't believe my Farrah's eighteen."
"DOUG: My kid was eighteen was she was ten."
"CARRIE: Men."
"DOUG: What?"
"LORELAI: Lay low, Doug. They're setting traps. So, um, what are we doing this year?"
"TERRY: We're throwing a big party on a yacht."
"LORELAI: Fun."
"TERRY: The party starts while it's in dock, then it sails for three hours and concludes with a fireworks show."
"CARRIE: How's the fundraising going?"
"TERRY: Terrific. The last fashion show alone brought in half of what we need, and the bake sale today brought in way more than I expected. Oh, that reminds me. [pushes a box toward Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"TERRY: Our cash box. You are the Grad Night treasurer."
"LORELAI: I'm the what?"
"TERRY: Before you got here, we took a little vote and you won."
"LORELAI: Well, uh, maybe there should be a recount 'cause I stink with money."
"TERRY: The vote was unanimous."
"LORELAI: I was late, can we revote?"
"CARRIE: Doug was late, too, and he was voted lead chaperone."
"DOUG: Goody."
"LORELAI: Come on, we can take 'em."
"CARRIE: It's really not a tough job, Lorelai. You just manage the cash, keep the simple books, it's easy."
"TERRY: Although, it does mean if you don't show up at our next meeting, we're going to assume you ran off with our money."
"LORELAI: No, no, I wouldn't do that."
"[Max walks into the cafeteria]"
"MAX: Hello, ladies. Hope I'm not too late. Oh, and gentleman, sorry."
"CARRIE: Oh, Doug's one of the ladies now."
"MAX: Well, good to see you all. Terry, Carrie. Lorelai, good to see you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, good, same here."
"MAX: So, what'd I miss?"
"TERRY: Nothing much. Lorelai's been made our Grad Night treasurer."
"MAX: You up to the challenge?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I'll watch the little box here."
"MAX: And let me guess, other than that, they've been picking on you mercilessly."
"DOUG: Pretty much."
"MAX: Well, I'm here to lend you gender support, my friend. So, Terry, why don't you continue?"
"TERRY: Great. We were discussing Grad Night."
"MAX: The yacht. Sounds great."
"TERRY: Now, we've already spoken to six caterers, they're all excited to bid on the project, but a couple are so expensive that I know they'll price themselves out of the running."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorela and Sookie are walking through the town square]"
"SOOKIE: Weird. Very weird."
"LORELAI: It's as if we had no history. He treated me the same as he treated what's her name and the overly coifed lady and the one who kept jiggling her leg the whole time."
"SOOKIE: Ugh, I hate that."
"LORELAI: It's like an earthquake. And he was so nonchalant."
"SOOKIE: So, standoff-y?"
"LORELAI: No, he was just Max. And I wanted to hook up with after to talk, but very conveniently, he excused himself five minutes early for an appointment and I couldn't walk out early with him because I'm the stupid treasurer and it would look fishy."
"SOOKIE: They made you treasurer. Are they insane?"
"LORELAI: I tried to tell them. And what's with this appointment nonsense? And no eye contact."
"SOOKIE: You mean he never once looked at you?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he looked, but it was very lacking in meaning."
"SOOKIE: Were you looking at him meaningfully?"
"LORELAI: No. I was trying to play it cool."
"SOOKIE: Well, there you go. He was doing the same thing. You were both James Dean-ing it, trying to keep it professional."
"LORELAI: No, he was not playing at it, I was. He was really it."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Cool."
"SOOKIE: Got it."
"LORELAI: So. . ."
"SOOKIE: Maybe you two never kissed."
"LORELAI: Me and Max? Oh no, we kissed."
"SOOKIE: Maybe it was an illusion."
"LORELAI: It was not an illusion, Doug Henning. We kissed."
"SOOKIE: Don't be so sure because something like this happened to me when I was like ten. I was so into Leif Garrett and I fantasized about kissing him so much that at some point, I really thought it happened."
"LORELAI: I kissed Max, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: I can still feel Leif's lips on mine."
"LORELAI: I kissed him."
"SOOKIE: Well, what is Rory's take on all this?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I told her about the kiss at first, but it's weird. I mean, he's back at Chilton and I'm back having some sort of involvement with her teacher. She's dealing with finals and everything. I don't wanna stress her out about this."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai, what's the ultimate thing here? Do you wanna get back together with him?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I don't know what I'm feeling or what I'm looking for these days, and I hate that. 'Cause it's so wishy-washy, but it's true. I mean, technically, I'm still seeing Alex, although it's more intermittent than ever. I'm not even sure I wanna get back together with Max. The kiss just happened out of the blue."
"SOOKIE: The alleged kiss."
"LORELAI: Sookie, we kissed."
"SOOKIE: Okay, calm down."
"LORELAI: If I knew where Max was on all this, I would know better where I was. It's like when you go to a steak and lobster place, it's easier to know what you want once you know what your date wants. Like, you want steak if he's getting lobster, 'cause then you can share. Or if he's not, you can get surf and turf, though you risk looking like a pig, but some guys aren't turned on by a big appetite, and now I'm not just confused, I'm massively hungry."
"SOOKIE: Me, too. Maybe lunch will take your mind off it a bit."
"LORELAI: Hope so."
"SOOKIE: Are you sure there was really an Alex?"
"LORELAI: Stop."
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH"
"[The principal is in his office. There's a knock at the door]"
"PRINCIPAL: Come in."
"[Jess opens the door]"
"PRINCIPAL: Well, well. Jess Mariano. What a pleasure. Sit down."
"JESS: I was just trying to buy prom tickets and they told me to go see you."
"PRINCIPAL: Sit down. So, the prom, huh? I wouldn't have taken you for someone who'd wanna go to the prom."
"JESS: My girlfriend wants to."
"PRINCIPAL: Oh, that's too bad."
"JESS: What, why?"
"PRINCIPAL: Because you flunked out."
"JESS: I what?"
"PRINCIPAL: You're not graduating, Jess. Prom tickets are for graduating seniors only. Guess your girlfriend's outta luck."
"JESS: Now wait a minute. I'm just a little behind. I can catch up, no sweat."
"PRINCIPAL: You can't, you missed too much."
"JESS: It hasn't been that much."
"PRINCIPAL: Thirty-one days you've been out. Cutoff's twenty."
"JESS: So that's it, just like that?"
"PRINCIPAL: That's it."
"JESS: Thanks for the warning."
"PRINCIPAL: You mean the nine warning slips we gave you weren't enough? All the meetings that I tried to set up between you and your guidance counselor, between you and me that you blew off, that wasn't warning enough?"
"JESS: I can catch up, I'm smarter than anyone here."
"PRINCIPAL: And humble, too."
"JESS: I can catch up, you'll see."
"PRINCIPAL: There's nothing to see, you're out."
"JESS: Fine, I'll take summer school if that's what you want."
"PRINCIPAL: Good, but it's not enough. You have to take the whole year over."
"JESS: The whole year? No way."
"PRINCIPAL: Then no diploma."
"JESS: At least let me go to the prom, what's the big deal?"
"PRINCIPAL: We're done here."
"JESS: Come on."
"PRINCIPAL: You wanna talk about coming back next year, my door's open."
"JESS: I'm not gonna miss this place."
"PRINCIPAL: Vice versa."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks to the living room where Rory is getting ready to leave]"
"LORELAI: No, no, it's impossible."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I just counted the money in the cash box and I'm eighteen dollars short."
"RORY: Weren't you supposed to deposit all that at the bank?"
"LORELAI: Uh, be judgmental later. Help me in my fiscal crisis here."
"RORY: Did you count the money when they gave it to you?"
"LORELAI: Ah, I glanced at it."
"RORY: Boy, you are a sucky treasurer."
"LORELAI: The job was forced on me."
"RORY: Well, the cash box must've been short when you got it."
"LORELAI: Or maybe a burglar broke in here. That could've happened."
"RORY: A burglar who bypassed out TV, our stereo, and our jewelry and went straight for the Booster Club cash box and took eighteen dollars and left the rest?"
"LORELAI: Some burglars are less greedy than others."
"RORY: Well, I'm out of answers."
"LORELAI: Great. I'm gonna have to put eighteen of my own dollars in to ward off suspicion. You're off to the party this early?"
"RORY: Jess and I are helping the band set up. I do the cymbals."
"LORELAI: You're not taking your purse."
"RORY: I'm not?"
"LORELAI: You don't need money, you don't need ID."
"RORY: Well, where will I keep my house key?"
"LORELAI: You'll put your house key through the metal thingy on your belt. You'll only lose it if you take off your belt, and if you're taking off your belt for any reason at the party, I'm not sure I want you coming home."
"RORY: Brilliant."
"LORELAI: Uh, your shoes okay? You got good traction?"
"RORY: Traction?"
"LORELAI: Well, there'll be liquids of various textures and disgustingness. You eating there?"
"RORY: Oh, if they have stuff."
"LORELAI: Do not eat chips out of a communal bowl. You might as well stick your hand in a toilet."
"RORY: Nice."
"LORELAI: If you're desperate, offer to be the person who replenishes them with new bags and grab a handful out of the new bag and dump the rest in the communal bowl."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: And keep in mind that getting up on a table and performing a song of any kind will haunt you for the rest of your life. Trust me. Been there, done that."
"RORY: I wasn't planning on doing that."
"LORELAI: Hm, those things are never planned. You going now?"
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: I'm going, too. I'll lock it up."
"RORY: Otherwise I'd have to undo my belt. Enjoy your Booster Club meeting."
"LORELAI: I will. Hey, hon?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: I promised myself I wasn't gonna ask you about Max anymore considering the history and that he's back teaching you and all. . .and I'm gonna keep my promise. Good, huh?"
"RORY: Very good."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, that's all I wanted to say."
"RORY: Okay."
"[they both leave]"
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[The band is setting up before the party]"
"DAVE: Does this set up feel right to everybody?"
"LANE: Cool by me."
"BRIAN: Me, too."
"DAVE: How's it look out there?"
"RORY: Like you're gonna b*llet straight to the top of the charts, with a b*llet or a - a g*n's gonna sh**t a b*llet, and I'm not, uh, familiar with the precise terminology, but it's working, right?"
"JESS: They look like a band to me."
"ZACH: You need to move back more."
"BRIAN: Why?"
"ZACH: Because when I do my double jump kick off the amp with slashing windmills, I'm gonna need more room."
"LANE: Well, don't do that then."
"DAVE: Yeah, sounds a little too Milli Vanilli, Zach."
"BRIAN: And if I back up anymore, my extension cord might damage the miniature date palm."
"LANE: The what?"
"BRIAN: It's what that's called. My aunt's got one."
"ZACH: Dude, don't call plants by their specific names, it's very not rock and roll."
"DAVE: Let's finalize the set list, guys."
"[Rory walks over to Kyle, who is putting breakable objects away in a box]"
"RORY: Need any help hiding the valuables, Kyle?"
"KYLE: Nope. We stashed the snow globes, hid the Lladros, now we're just packing up the Hummels."
"MARSHALL: Two to go."
"KYLE: Marshall, watch it! Boy with Toothache is mom's favorite."
"MARSHALL: Sorry."
"KYLE: Hey, did I hear the singer say something about a double jump kick?"
"RORY: We'll talk him out of it."
"KYLE: Good."
"MARSHALL: Zealous Xylophonist, that's sweet."
"DAVE: Starting off with a slow tune won't work, Brian."
"ZACH: Yeah, man, it's so emo, it makes me sick."
"BRIAN: I was just playing devil's advocate."
"DAVE: Devil's advocate."
"ZACH: Not a bad name."
"[Two boys enter the house with a keg]"
"BOYS: Keg!"
"KYLE: That's my cousin Rick. He just turned twenty-one. Pretty awesome."
"RICK: Twenty-one, yeah!"
"LANE: What is that, beer?"
"ZACH: No, it's one of those milk kegs."
"BRIAN: Good one."
"LANE: There's beer, is that legal?"
"DAVE: Well, apparently Rick is twenty-one."
"RICK: Twenty-one, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!"
"DAVE: Or just really into that particular integer."
"LANE: Beer."
"ZACH: It's a party, Lane. What were you expecting, Tang?"
"LANE: No, I guess not."
"KYLE: The carpet, guys. Lift it, lift it."
"RICK: Oh, we got it."
"KYLE: Marshall, go get towels to set it on. And not the good towels, the swim towels."
"[Young Chui walks up to the band]"
"YOUNG CHUI: Anything I can help you with, guys?"
"DAVE: Uh, we got it covered. Thanks, Young Chui."
"YOUNG CHUI: How about you, Lane? You need water or anything?"
"DAVE: Uh, Young Chui, you should probably stay away from the band area. We got a lot of cords and stuff, and I don't want you to get electrocuted and die."
"YOUNG CHUI: Oh, okay. [walks away]"
"DAVE: So, is he staying for the whole thing?"
"LANE: He's got nowhere else to go."
"KYLE: These are the good towels."
"MARSHALL: These are the swim towels."
"KYLE: The swim towels have stripes and they're oversized. Now, come on, hurry. We still have to put away my dad's military icon collector plates."
"JESS: We're here a little early, don't you think?"
"RORY: No, we're with the band. We're the roadies and the sound crew and I'm advising on makeup for Lane and I'm the keeper of Brian's sandwich and thermos. So we're busy backstage-type people."
"JESS: We're dork-early."
"RORY: Come on, get into the spirit of things. Hello Cleveland!"
"JESS: Guess I'll wander around a little."
"[Zach jumps off the amp and knocks over the microphone]"
"DAVE: And you couldn't even work your slashing windmills in."
"ZACH: Yeah, maybe I'll skip it."
"DAVE: Good thinking."

"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Lorelai walks past a group of guests and over to Michel at the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Uh, Michel, are you okay?"
"MICHEL: Do I look okay?"
"LORELAI: Are those people waiting for a bellman?"
"MICHEL: No, they're waiting for a unicorn to sing to a rainbow. Yes, a bellman. But there's only one because we had to lay off the others. And a maid called in sick, so not only am I dealing with answering phones and checking people in and out, but I'm going to have to do turn down service and carry people's bags to their rooms and. . ."
"LORELAI: You're going to a bad place. Now just take a breath and go to a good place."
"MICHEL: Plus, I had to run home and play with my Chow puppies because the Chow book said they need love and stimulation or else they'll m*rder you later on. And Pau-Pau had fallen in her water bowl and was soaking wet so I had to blow dry her and. . ."
"LORELAI: Okay, the nice place, and I can stay and help a little bit, okay?"
"MICHEL: She could've drowned. I'm a bad daddy."
"LORELAI: Pau-Pau's fine. Just watch the desk, get the bellman back here. I'll do turn down."
"MICHEL: [to guest checking in] Have you ever seen Chow puppies? You want to eat them up."
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks up to Jess]"
"RORY: They're getting ready to go on. They're all hyperventilating to the same rhythm, so that's a positive sign. What are you looking at?"
"JESS: The happy family. Kinda depressing if you ask me."
"RORY: Oh, Mr. Sunshine. You're spreading so much joy around, you're embarrassing yourself. You've got to get a little more moody."
"JESS: I'll try."
"RORY: Let's look around a little bit."
"JESS: Okay. [they walk past a crying girl] Seems a little early for that."
"RORY: It never is."
"JESS: Bathroom line."
"RORY: Figures."
"[they walk into the kitchen; some boys are standing around the keg]"
"JESS: Hey. What's up with you guys?"
"KYLE: Stupid keg."
"MARSHALL: It's not working."
"JESS: Where's the tap?"
"KYLE: The what?"
"JESS: It's a keg, it's sealed. You need to hook up a tap to pump the beer out."
"KYLE: I told you the thing in the bag did something."
"RICK: [pulls the tap out of a bag] No instructions."
"JESS: Jeez. [he attaches the tap to the keg] There, start pumping."
"MARSHALL: All right. To Jess!"
"KYLE: To Jess."
"RICK: To Jess."
"JESS: Yeah."
"KYLE: Yeah."
"RORY: You and Springsteen, the working man's hero."
"[they walk up to the band]"
"RORY: You ready to go on, guys?"
"DAVE: Only if Brian rallies."
"RORY: What's wrong, Brian?"
"BRIAN: I don't feel good."
"DAVE: It's his heartburn again."
"ZACH: I told you, dude, it's your citrus intake. Stop eating oranges."
"[Lane walks up to Rory]"
"LANE: Rory. Uh, you've gotta do me a big favor."
"RORY: Name it."
"LANE: Young Chui's driving me crazy."
"RORY: What do you want me to do?"
"LANE: Uh, if you see any unattached girls who you think would go for a very available, uh, needy, self-delusional guy, send 'em Young Chui's way."
"RORY: I'll keep a lookout."
"DAVE: Lane."
"LANE: Oh my God, this is it."
"RORY: Knock 'em dead."
"DAVE: Brian, you with us?"
"BRIAN: I have completely forgotten how to play the bass."
"ZACH: Perfect."
"DAVE: Brian, you're just nervous. Take a deep breath and use your inhaler."
"ZACH: Yeah, and don't forget that the hair and fingernails on John Entwistle's body were still growing when they brought in his replacement."
"BRIAN: You're gonna replace me?"
"DAVE: We're not gonna replace you. Just relax and let the music flow through you."
"RICK: Come on, let's go!"
"GIRL: Yeah, come on - rock and roll!"
"LANE: Zach, start."
"DAVE: Wait, wait, someone's gotta introduce us. Rory, introduce us."
"RORY: Me? Why me?"
"RICK: Come on, let's go!"
"MARSHALL: Yeah, crank it!"
"DAVE: Go, go."
"RORY: All right. Uh, now, who wants to hear some tunes? [the crowd cheers] Okay, good, there's a consensus. Here they are, Stars Hollow's rockingest band. Although they're not all from Stars Hollow, but they, um, they practice there, so we kind of consider them our own. Here they are. . .[to the band] What's your name?"
"ZACH: ""Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert."""
"DAVE: ""The Chops."" ""Follow them to the Edge of the Dessert."""
"ZACH: ""The Chops."""

"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Turn down."
"LUKE: Come on in."
"[Lorelai walks into the room]"
"LORELAI: Hello there. This won't take long. Luke."
"LUKE: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What are you doing here?"
"LUKE: You invited us, remember?"
"LORELAI: Us?"
"[Nicole walks out of the bathroom]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. Hi Nicole. There's the ""us""."
"NICOLE: Hi, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I don't usually do this turn down service. I mean, I did when I started many moons ago, but that's when I was a maid. Wow, you guys are here."
"LUKE: You didn't know?"
"LORELAI: No. I mean, I remember inviting you. It's great that you're here. Um, but when I told Michel I would do the turn down service, it must've slipped his mind that you were here. Pau-Pau fell in her water dish."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Never mind. I'll just do this and get out of your way."
"LUKE: Hey, you don't have to."
"NICOLE: Yeah, Lorelai, really, we can do all this."
"LORELAI: No, you are our guests and you deserve to get what you're paying for."
"LUKE: We're not paying."
"LORELAI: No, no, but this is where you start paying - in sweat."
"LUKE: What?"
"NICOLE: Fame, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Debbie Allen. In sweat. I just loved how she said that. Let's see. . .uh, you need towels."
"LUKE: You can just give 'em to me."
"LORELAI: Okay, here are your towels. And, let me see. . . oh, I'll draw your curtains closed. What else, what else? It's been a little while since I've done this. Oh, do you want a fire?"
"LUKE: I don't know. Nicole?"
"NICOLE: Uh, a fire would be nice."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll light it for you. We have these new log bags now, makes it real easy. Uh, okay. [tries to light the fireplace] So, nothing like a fire on a cold night like this, huh?"
"LUKE: Mm."
"LORELAI: Hm, I'm not having much luck here. And, uh, you know what, we laid off the person who was able to light these things no problem, now we can't light these things, and ironically we laid him off because of a fire."
"LUKE: It's okay, forget it. I can light it."
"LORELAI: Okay. What else, let's see. Oh, um, well, turn down. I need to turn down the bed."
"LUKE: Really, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: No, no, no. Up, up, up. Okay, I'll get ya all settled here, nice and comfy. Great lines with these covers here. Pillows, nice and plump. And a couple of pillow mints. There you go, now you're all ready to. . .uh, you're all ready for your evening."
"LUKE: Fine, good, that's good."
"NICOLE: Yes, great, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, you're all set. Just call if you need anything, and have fun."
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[The band finishes up a song and the crowd cheers]"
"DAVE: Okay, thanks. Uh, we're gonna take a short break and then we'll be back."
"RORY: Guys, that was amazing. Really, it was awesome."
"DAVE: Thanks."
"ZACH: Dude, you did good, you really did. But you got a little too close to me when you were singing into the mike."
"BRIAN: I got as close as I had to."
"ZACH: Your nose touched my cheek, man. That's too close."
"LANE: Guys, come on, just be happy. We played and we didn't suck, right?"
"DAVE: Yeah, it was good."
"KYLE: Come on, let's spread the word. All drinks on coasters, please."
"MARSHALL: Hey, the coasters are there to be used."
"LANE: Dave, what's wrong? I mean, we totally rocked."
"DAVE: We sounded great."
"LANE: Then what is it?"
"DAVE: It's this Young Chui thing. It's driving me crazy."
"LANE: Why?"
"DAVE: Why? Lane, when are you. . .when are you gonna break up with him?"
"LANE: It's complicated. Young Chui's very sensitive right now."
"DAVE: I'm sorry, but I don't care."
"LANE: If you got to know him, you'd understand."
"DAVE: I don't want to get to know him. I just want him to do his part and break up with you so that I can take you to your prom. He's acting like he's in love with you or something."
"LANE: Well. . ."
"DAVE: Oh, no. Is he?"
"LANE: Kind of."
"DAVE: Kind of?"
"LANE: Apparently, totally."
"DAVE: Young Chui is in love with you and that's why he won't break up with you, so that he gets to take you to your prom. And he knows that your mom likes him and that we're running out of time."
"LANE: No, we're not out of time."
"DAVE: The prom's in two weeks."
"LANE: I'll make it happen, I swear."
"DAVE: It's too late. I'll see you for the next set. [walks away]"
"LANE: Dave."
"[cut to Rory and Jess]"
"JESS: So, what now?"
"RORY: What do you mean, what now?"
"JESS: Let's go, let's get out of here."
"RORY: Go where?"
"JESS: Anywhere."
"RORY: It's early."
"JESS: It's boring."
"RORY: Jess, we can't just go."
"JESS: Yes, we can."
"RORY: The band's playing a whole other set."
"JESS: They can do it without us."
"RORY: I don't wanna leave. Now, come on, try to have fun. Talk, mingle."
"JESS: I don't wanna talk to anybody else. I don't like anybody else."
"RORY: I don't wanna leave. I need to stay here for Lane, come on. Gloomy."
"JESS: We'll go right when they get done playing, okay?"
"RORY: Sure, Grandpa."
"JESS: Rory."
"RORY: We'll go then, I promise."
"KYLE: Hey, you drop a chip, you pick it up. It's common courtesy folks."
"CUT TO LATER AT THE PARTY"
"[Rory and Jess run into Dean and Lindsay]"
"RORY: Hi guys."
"DEAN: Hey."
"LINDSAY: Hey."
"RORY: So, Lindsay, what did you think of Lane's band?"
"LINDSAY: I liked 'em. Although I didn't recognize most of the songs."
"DEAN: She's not a music freak like you."
"RORY: Well, we all can't be freaks."
"DEAN: True."
"RORY: So what kind of music do you like?"
"LINDSAY: I don't know. . .uh, Michelle Branch, Matchbox 20."
"JESS: Jeez."
"RORY: I like them, too. I mean, I like all kinds of things."
"LINDSAY: You used to go to our school."
"RORY: He still goes."
"DEAN: Really? I haven't seen you around much."
"JESS: What are you, the attendance monitor? I'm gonna go see what the hell's holding up this line. [walks away]"
"RORY: He's not feeling well."
"LINDSAY: That's too bad."
"DEAN: Uh, well, we'll see you later."
"LINDSAY: Bye."
"RORY: Bye."
"[cut to Lane in another room]"
"MARSHALL: Hey, Lane. There's some guy looking for you."
"LANE: Good, where?"
"[he points across the room to Young Chui, who waves to Lane; Lane walks to the kitchen]"
"KYLE: Oh, oh, and the part where Gimli the Dwarf is riding his horse, then Legolas grabs the front straps and swings himself up on top of it."
"RICK: Dude, dude, that was awesome!"
"LANE: Any more left in that thing?"
"KYLE: Plenty. Foam or no foam?"
"LANE: Anything you hand me, Kyle, I'm downing."
"[he hands her a cup of beer and she takes a sip]"
"LANE: Very refreshing."
"KYLE: Oh, oh, and at the end when the tree is on fire and then he puts himself out in the flood. Oh!"
"CUT TO CHILTON CAFETERIA"
"[Lorelai walks in for the Booster Club meeting]"
"LORELAI: Hi, sorry I'm late. Actually, I'm not late. I was right on time, but then I remembered I left the cash box in the car. I mean, I was not used to having to carry a cash box. So I went back and got it, and I was carrying it by the handle and the stupid thing flew open and money flew everywhere, and I may have lost eighteen bucks in the process. Anyway, here I am. So where's Doug?"
"TERRY: I believe we scared Doug away."
"CARRIE: I love scaring the Dougs away."
"JOAN: So, you were telling us about these ridiculous dock fees."
"TERRY: Right. We got what was supposed to be a final quote from the yacht owner, who then remembers he failed to mention an exorbitant dock fee."
"JOAN: Unbelievable."
"TERRY: And I don't wanna pay. I made some calls and I have several suggestions on how to get around it. Oh, but first, let me bring in a student from the senior class who wanted to give her own thoughts about the yacht trip. Come on in."
"[Paris walks into the cafeteria]"
"CARRIE: [quietly] Oh no."
"JOAN: [quietly] Paris Gellar."
"PARIS: Ladies, thank you for seeing me. I know you're busy with work and have families to get home to, so I really appreciate your courtesy, and I'll make it brief. Having Grad Night on a yacht is the worst idea since Neville Chamberlain told the people of England, ""Hey, don't worry about h*tler. He's a stand-up chap."" Forget the inconvenience of being at sea with guests unable to leave if the party is dull or if the band, which will inevitably be composed of accountants with semi-mullets, decides to do a half-hour tribute to Kenny G. The seasickness factor alone, abetted by snuck-in flasks and badly cooked food, could lead to an epidemic, which may lead to lawsuits the school could ill afford. These points conclusively call for a change in venue to a hotel ballroom, a restaurant facility, several of which I've already called. Here are the results of my research. I've also included a list of maritime disasters from the past fifty years -- capsizings, onboard fires, et cetera -- and trust me, it'll put you off your lunch. Thank you for your time and cooperation. [leaves]"
"TERRY: So, my thought is to discuss these yacht fees directly with the yacht owner first."
"JOAN: Absolutely."
"[a woman walks in]"
"BARBARA: Hello everyone, sorry I'm late."
"TERRY: Oh, that's okay."
"BARBARA: I'm Barbara Epstein, I teach drama, and I'll be your faculty rep tonight."
"TERRY: Welcome Barbara."
"BARBARA: I just left Max Medina, he filled me in on everything that you're doing here."
"TERRY: Good, then we'll get a running start. We're dealing with a fee that we do not wanna pay for this yacht."
"LORELAI: Keep going, girls. I just need. . .um, I'll be right back."
"TERRY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Joan, you gotta watch the cash box."
"JOAN: Will do."
"[Lorelai leaves. In the hallway, she walks up to janitor]"
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry. Um, nearest bathroom? [he points] That way, huh? I'm gonna go this way. I think the farthest one is the one I'm looking for. I told a friend I'd meet her there, so I'll just go. . ."
"[she walks down the hall and sees Max inside a classroom. She opens the door.]"
"LORELAI: Gotcha."
"MAX: You sure did."
"LORELAI: Bad time?"
"MAX: Kind of."
"[she walks in]"
"LORELAI: Busy?"
"MAX: Real busy."
"LORELAI: You're avoiding me."
"MAX: No, I'm not."
"LORELAI: Then what's with the 'I'm busy' thing?"
"MAX: I can't be busy?"
"LORELAI: Ah, but that's avoiding me, saying you're busy."
"MAX: No, it's descriptive of my current state. These essays are due back tomorrow, I'm way behind on my reading, so I'm eating my day-old vending machine at my desk in my futile attempt to try and catch up."
"LORELAI: Two rotations."
"MAX: What?"
"LORELAI: It's in the Booster Club bylaws, my friend. I looked it up myself. Faculty advisors are supposed to do a minimum of two consecutive rotations with the Booster Club and you did only one."
"MAX: I did three."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MAX: I did three. You went to my third one. I did the previous two you weren't at."
"LORELAI: I'm assuming you have documentation?"
"MAX: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: With Lorelai Gilmore, it's trust but verify."
"MAX: Well, I'm sure I can scrounge up a witness."
"LORELAI: Why did you treat me so weird at that last meeting?"
"MAX: I treated you with respect and kindness."
"LORELAI: That's why it was weird. It's how you treated Terry and Joan, too. I mean, did you also kiss Terry and Joan?"
"MAX: Yeah, I did. And Doug. He was the best of the three."
"LORELAI: Max."
"MAX: I was playing it cool. You were, too. I was just following suit."
"LORELAI: No, I was playing it cool because you were playing it cool. And I'm the treasurer and the treasurer has to be cool or it just looks suspicious."
"MAX: Wait, wait, wait. Ten feet."
"LORELAI: Ten feet?"
"MAX: That's a safe distance for us, and the more furniture in between, the better."
"LORELAI: I'm not gonna attack you."
"MAX: I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about me. I mean, there are people still walking the halls and this is my workplace and I can't be held responsible for what I do around you. I mean, you are like a - like a - like a mythological creature that casts some kind of spell on me and makes me act stupid. I'm not stupid. I don't act stupid with anyone else. Uh, we're too close again."
"LORELAI: Okay, I didn't bring a frickin' tape measure. I'm not good at judging distances. You'll have to help me out with the ten feet thing."
"MAX: Well, it's a little bigger than a basketball player. Just keep a really big basketball player between us."
"LORELAI: Wow, I bet there's a sentence that's never been uttered before."
"MAX: There are other complications with this whole thing, you know. Just thought I'd tell you."
"LORELAI: What other complications?"
"MAX: I was seeing someone in California. There, I said it."
"LORELAI: You mean, you weren't living like a Trappist monk while you were in California? I'm shocked."
"MAX: That doesn't bother you?"
"LORELAI: Max, we weren't together. I mean, I have been seeing someone, too."
"MAX: Well, I would probably still be seeing Diane if I hadn't moved back here. That's something to think about."
"LORELAI: So you can't date anyone for the rest of your life because if you'd stayed in California, which you didn't, you might still be dating Diane?"
"MAX: Yes. No. Ugh!"
"LORELAI: Do you want an aspirin? I probably have a. . .Tic Tac. Sorry, I shouldn't have teased you with that aspirin thing."
"MAX: You know, I thought we were both going to just pretend to ignore the kiss. Wasn't that the deal?"
"LORELAI: We had a deal? I don't remember a deal."
"MAX: You had your sh*t, okay? You had the ring and you said no."
"LORELAI: Yes, I did. And you said that that was right for you, too. You went to Stanford, you dated Diane, it was right for both of us."
"MAX: Well, what is this, now, right here?"
"LORELAI: It's us. Tada."
"MAX: Well, us needs to stay apart."
"LORELAI: Oh, Max, we had a whole country between us for a year. That's like eleven-thousand basketball players lying end to end, and yet, here we are. We can't avoid each other."
"MAX: I thought I was over you. I thought it was safe to come back here, but no, not the deal. I just, I think we should stay apart and never see each other ever again."
"LORELAI: That's impossible."
"MAX: No, it's not."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll be at the Chilton graduation and so will you."
"MAX: Well, I'll sit behind a tree."
"LORELAI: We could run into each other at a drugstore again."
"MAX: Well, I'm gonna order all my drugs online."
"LORELAI: If my car breaks down next to yours, will you stop?"
"MAX: I will stop, and keep my eyes straight forward, call a garage and then stay in my car with the radio on really loud 'til they come, and then I'm gone. And I say we start being apart right now."
"LORELAI: Okay. Whatever you want."
"MAX: This is what I want. And when I walk out that door, it could very well be the last time we see each other."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll abide by your wishes."
"MAX: Goodbye, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Goodbye, Max."
"[Max leaves the classroom and walks down the hall. As he walks by the other door from the classroom, Lorelai walks out and bumps into him.]"
"LORELAI: You said you were leaving."
"MAX: My car is that way."
"LORELAI: Well, I have to go that way, too."
"MAX: After you."
"LORELAI: Two seconds, we've already run into each other."
"MAX: Doesn't count."
"CUT TO KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks over to Young Chui]"
"RORY: Young Chui, have you seen Jess?"
"YOUNG CHUI: Uh, I think I saw him go upstairs. Have you seen Lane?"
"RORY: Not for awhile. She's probably with the band. Why don't you go see?"
"YOUNG CHUI: Oh, I don't wanna lose these seats."
"RORY: Right, right."
"[in the kitchen, Lane is refilling her beer, Kyle is on the phone]"
"KYLE: It's just me and Marshall, Mom, honest. . . okay, kiss Uncle Newtie for me. Bye. [hangs up]"
"LANE: Hey Kyle. Mind if I use your phone there?"
"KYLE: As long as it's local."
"LANE: Oh, it's local distance, yeah, don't worry."
"KYLE: Okay."
"[Lane picks up the phone and dials a number]"
"LANE: [on phone] Hello, Mama? Hi, how are you doing tonight?. . .It's Lane. Yeah, Lane. . . Nothing's wrong. In fact, I'm feeling pretty good right now. Had a beer and a half, nice cold beer. And I just thought I'd tell you, I'm drumming in a band tonight at a party and we rocked. We were The Clash and Rage Against the Machine and Nirvana combined. And I'm in love with Dave Rygalski. He's my guy, not Young Chui. Young Chui's a ship in the night, Mama. Not even a ship, he's a little tugboat tooting along and I'm not gonna go to the prom with him, unh uh. I'm going with Dave, because we rock together, Mama. The charade is over."
"[Dave walks in and hangs up the phone]"
"LANE: Hey."
"DAVE: What are you doing?"
"LANE: What I should've done months ago, Davey."
"DAVE: That was not your mother. Tell me that wasn't your mother."
"LANE: Oh, that was the mother. I am liberated, my friend."
"DAVE: You're drunk."
"LANE: No, I'm. . .am I?"
"DAVE: We're going on in five minutes. Can you even play?"
"LANE: Oh, I can hit the sticks on those brums."
"DAVE: Great, great, but what about the drums? [walks away]"
"LANE: Dave."
"[Rory walks upstairs and finds Jess sitting in an empty bedroom]"
"RORY: There you are."
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: I've been looking all over for you."
"JESS: Just got tired of everything down there."
"RORY: Are we allowed to be up here? I mean, Kyle was kind of discouraging it."
"JESS: When you have a party, you get what you get."
"RORY: Yeah, I guess. Sad boy, what's wrong? You were looking forward to this party, what happened?"
"JESS: Nothing."
"RORY: Something did. Come on, tell me. [they kiss] You're not tired of me, are you? [they kiss again] That's a pretty good answer."
"[They kiss again, then start making out on the bed]"
"RORY: Jess, wait. . . Jess, wait. . . Jess. [jumps up off the bed]"
"JESS: Jeez."
"RORY: Not here, not now."
"JESS: Fine."
"RORY: What's wrong with you?"
"JESS: Nothing's wrong with me."
"RORY: Someone could've walked in that door."
"JESS: And Santa Claus could come down the chimney, whatever."
"RORY: You did not think that it was going to happen like this, did you?"
"JESS: I don't know what I think anymore."
"RORY: Jess."
"JESS: Rory, stop, just stop! I did not invite you up here, you came up here on your own!"
"RORY: [starts to cry] I don't know what I did. [leaves room]"
"JESS: You didn't do anything. Rory. . ."
"[Rory walks down the staircase crying and Dean stops her]"
"DEAN: Rory. Are you okay?"
"RORY: Yes. No. I don't know."
"DEAN: Whoa, what happened?"
"[Jess walks down the steps]"
"JESS: Figures."
"[He walks away and Dean follows him]"
"RORY: Dean, no."
"[Dean punches Jess and they start fighting throughout the house]"
"RORY: Stop it, guys! Stop it!"
"[Dave walks up to Young Chui]"
"DAVE: Young Chui, we gotta talk."
"YOUNG CHUI: Don't touch me, Dave."
"DAVE: I'm not gonna touch you. I just think it's time you and I had a real talk about the Lane situation."
"YOUNG CHUI: Just a talk?"
"DAVE: We'll keep it friendly, honest."
"[Dean and Jess burst through a door and knock Dave into Young Chui]"
"YOUNG CHUI: Ah, get off me!"
"DAVE: I'm trying."
"[Dean and Jess knock into the band equipment]"
"ZACH: Bogus."
"[Some kids push Dean and Jess out onto the front lawn. Two boys pull them apart]"
"RORY: Guys, just stop it!"
"JESS: Let go of me!"
"RICK: Cops."
"MARSHALL: Oh, no, man. Is that. . ."
"KYLE: Boy with Toothache."
"MARSHALL: Oh, you're dead."
"[a police car pulls up to the house]"
"OFFICER: Okay, dump your cups and go home. Now."
"RORY: Jess. . ."
"[Jess leaves. Rory sees Lane throwing up in the bushes and walks over to her]"
"RORY: Lane. . ."

"OPEN AT KYLE'S HOUSE"
"[Kyle and Marshall are cleaning up litter in the front yard.]"
"KYLE: Get the wrapper."
"MARSHALL: What wrapper?"
"KYLE: The Tootsie Roll wrapper."
"MARSHALL: What Tootsie Roll wrapper?"
"KYLE: The one at your feet."
"MARSHALL: I don't see it."
"KYLE: It's right there."
"MARSHALL: Where?"
"KYLE: Marshall, stop arguing with me, my parents are watching."
"[Lorelai is waiting on the sidewalk; Rory walks out of the house with a backpack]"
"LORELAI: Have you see these guys? They're hilarious."
"RORY: I got it, we can go."
"LORELAI: Why are you holding it like that?"
"RORY: Because when Lane left it here last night, it was a very different color."
"LORELAI: Are you sure she's gonna want that back? It's been left alone all night at a keg party. There's no getting it over that. That backpack is permanently scarred. That backpack is Zelda Fitzgerald."
"RORY: Well, Zelda's going home."
"LORELAI: Okay. Your first cop-raided party. I am just so proud."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I just wish I could've been there."
"RORY: It was no big deal."
"LORELAI: Did they bring the paddywagon?"
"RORY: Yeah, but then we snuck out the backdoor of the speak-easy and headed straight for the Algonquin."
"LORELAI: How was Benchley?"
"RORY: Drunk again."
"LORELAI: So tell me more about this party last night. I mean, I know the end, but what happened in the middle?"
"RORY: Lane's band played, they were great, and then people just hung out and talked, and then, uh, there was some sort of fight, I guess. The cops came, that's it."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[Luke walks up to the house]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: I'm in bed. I have ten more minutes to sleep. Not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but still, ten minutes is ten minutes. You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: Sure, yeah."
"RORY: Ten minutes is great."
"LUKE: And then the phone rings, and it just rings and rings and rings and rings, so I pick it up."
"LORELAI: And then hopefully got your hearing checked."
"LUKE: Can I finish my story?"
"LORELAI: I'm just saying, that's a lot of rings."
"LUKE: And on the other end of the phone is someone named John who says he's Kyle's father, and Kyle threw a party last night without permission. And two guys got into a fight and tore the place apart, so John wants me to come down and take a look at the damage and discuss some sort of solution to the problem of the damages. Now, I don't know John, and I certainly don't know Kyle, but I do know someone who would get into a fight at a party and leave the place completely trashed. It's a wild guess, but I think his name rhymes with Tess. So here I am, heading in there to talk to John about Kyle and discuss what is to be done about the Hummel."
"LORELAI: The what?"
"LUKE: Exactly."
"[Luke walks toward the front door]"
"LORELAI: Uh, so let's get back to the party recap. Any little details you wanna tell Mommy?"
"RORY: Jess and Dean got into the fight."
"LORELAI: Over you."
"RORY: I was a contributing factor."
"LORELAI: Was anyone hurt?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: And that's why the cops came and broke up the party?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: So not only did you go to a cop-raided party but you started the raid?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: This fence is broken because of you, this crap is on the ground because of you."
"RORY: What's your point?"
"LORELAI: [sings] Did you ever know that you're my hero?"
"RORY: Oh my God!"
"LORELAI: [sings] You're everything I would like to be. And I could fly higher than an eagle, 'cause you are the wind beneath my wings."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Guests are gathered in the lobby for breakfast. Two of them walk up to Lorelai.]"
"DENNIS: Oh, these muffins, they're brilliant."
"PEG: Tell us you sell your muffin mix."
"LORELAI: Sookie, these people wanna throw roses at your feet."
"SOOKIE: And I will let them."
"PEG: Listen, Sookie, Dennis and I and a bunch of us others wondered if you offered cooking classes."
"SOOKIE: Cooking classes?"
"DENNIS: Some of the better B&B's have them on the itinerary."
"SOOKIE: Oh, of course they do. So, we do, too."
"PEG: We will be your disciples."
"SOOKIE: Oh my gosh, we're gonna have so much fun. We'll start with some spreads and jams, and if there's time - desserts. I have this chocolate balm. . .oh, but breads. . .and soups!"
"LORELAI: Um, Sookie, hon, we don't have a kitchen."
"SOOKIE: Oh, right."
"PEG: There's no kitchen?"
"SOOKIE: Okay, not a problem. You'll all come to my house."
"PEG: Can't wait."
"DENNIS: Cheers."
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk to the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Uh, make a note - if the guests are gonna wear those robes downstairs, we need to buy ones with thicker material."
"SOOKIE: Really."
"LORELAI: Seeing the sunlight hit Dennis gave me a whole new respect for Peg."
"SOOKIE: Hey, listen, uh, Jackson's up in Rochester today helping his cousin rebuild his Nova. He's not getting home 'til late, so you know what that makes me?"
"LORELAI: Available."
"SOOKIE: Like an intern."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"SOOKIE: What are you and Rory doing tonight?"
"LORELAI: I'm open. Rory's got plans with the grandparents."
"SOOKIE: I didn't know you guys were back in touch."
"LORELAI: I'm not, Rory is."
"SOOKIE: Ah."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm, yeah."
"SOOKIE: Well, at least the family pressure's off you now. That's good, right?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. I mean, before this whole Friday night dinner thing, I didn't see them regularly and we didn't talk regularly, so it wasn't weird when I didn't see them or talk to them regularly."
"SOOKIE: You miss them."
"LORELAI: No, I just feel like I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do. I feel guilty."
"SOOKIE: So what are you gonna do about it?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna hope it passes."
"SOOKIE: Sounds healthy."
"CUT TO CHURCH"
"[The priest is leading a service at the front of the room. Rory walks in with Lane's backpack and takes it to Lane, who is sitting at a table at the back of the church]"
"PRIEST: Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they. . ."
"RORY: Hey."
"LANE: Hi."
"RORY: So, how are you? How were things last night?"
"LANE: You mean, after my drunken call to my mother?"
"RORY: Yeah. What happened when you got home?"
"LANE: I'm not sure."
"RORY: What do you mean you're not sure?"
"LANE: Well, after I finished with my Farelly brothers' audition in the bushes - thank you for the hair-holding, by the way."
"RORY: Anytime."
"LANE: Dave dropped me off at home. He wanted to come in, but he's an only child and I saw no reason for his family line to end with him, so I went in and he left."
"RORY: And?"
"LANE: The place was dark."
"RORY: No Mrs. Kim?"
"LANE: No Mrs. Kim."
"RORY: No Mrs. Kim."
"LANE: So, of course, I panicked. What does this mean? I mean, when I come home ten minutes late from bible study, she has a cow. But I call her drunk, tell her I'm at a party, I'm a drummer in a band, and I'm in love with a non-Korean. . .I expected there to be backup - aunts, uncles, cousins pulled out from villages I've never heard of, but nothing."
"RORY: I don't understand."
"LANE: So I go upstairs to make sure everything's okay. I look in her room and she's in bed asleep."
"RORY: No."
"LANE: Then this morning, I get up, I go in the kitchen where she's making breakfast and I say, ""Good morning, Mama."""
"RORY: And?"
"LANE: She turns around, looks right at me and says, ""Good morning, Lane."""
"RORY: Really?"
"LANE: And those were the last words she's said to me all day."
"RORY: So she's freezing you out?"
"LANE: No, it was more Stepford than cold. You know, very calm, very serene."
"RORY: Okay, well, let's think. Maybe she didn't hear you."
"LANE: I was drunk, I could've slurred."
"RORY: Exactly. Maybe she thought you said you were at a smarty, playing clock music, drinking fear, and in love with Rave Smitchalsky."
"LANE: And how would that be better?"
"RORY: It's much less clear."
"LANE: What is that smell?"
"RORY: Your backpack."
"PRIEST: Blessed are they which are pers -"
"[The priest sees the rabbi at the back of the church gesturing for him to speed things up.]"
"PRIEST: [speaks quickly] Uh, blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs are the Kingdom of Heaven."
"RORY: You have to talk to her, Lane."
"LANE: I can't talk to her."
"RORY: Well, what are you going to do?"
"LANE: Well, first off, I volunteered to work this table for the next two months. Plus, I told her I'd go to that Seventh Day Adventist college in Hartford and live at home."
"RORY: Lane, no."
"LANE: And I told Dave to forget about the prom. There's no way that's gonna happen."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LANE: Don't be, it's my fault."
"[The rabbi enters with a group of people]"
"PRIEST: And utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me, Amen. Okay, let's go. Sorry, David."
"RABBI: No problem, Archie."
"[The priest leaves, the rabbi starts his service.]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Jess rushes around the crowded diner serving people]"
"WOMAN: Excuse me, I'd like some ham."
"JESS: Be right back."
"WOMAN: But I'd like some ham!"
"[Jess delivers a plate to a table]"
"MAN 1: Is this what I ordered?"
"JESS: Yes. [walks to the table by the door] Know what you want yet?"
"MAN 2: Oh, uh, no, not yet."
"JESS: You know what might help?"
"MAN 2: What?"
"JESS: Opening the menu."
"MAN 2: Yes, thank you for the tip."
"[Jess walks to the counter]"
"JESS: I need ham."
"CAESAR: No ham."
"JESS: We got a shipment of ham yesterday."
"CAESAR: No ham."
"JESS: Caesar, there's a lady over there that has been saying she wants ham for the last twenty minutes and if I go back there empty handed, there's a fifty-fifty chance that she will eat me."
"CAESAR: No ham."
"JESS: Then sew some bacon together 'cause that woman is getting ham."
"[Jess picks up a plate and walks toward the tables]"
"MAN 1: Excuse me, I don't think this is what I. . .[Jess exchanges his plate with the one he's carrying] Thank you."
"JESS: [holds up the plate] Who ordered this? Look in front of you. If there is nothing there and there should be, then this is yours."
"KIRK: Oh, here."
"[Jess gives Kirk the plate, then walks back over to the man at the table by the door]"
"JESS: Well?"
"MAN 2: What?"
"JESS: You know what you want yet?"
"MAN 2: I'll just have more coffee."
"JESS: More coffee coming up. Glad to make your dining dreams come true."
"[Taylor walks in]"
"TAYLOR: [sings] ""Oh, who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew. Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two, the candy man. Oh, the candy man can!"" Yes, that's right, the candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good, and I, ladies and gentlemen, am the candy man. Your candy man. I'm mixing it with love and making Stars Hollow taste good."
"JESS: Move."
"TAYLOR: Uh, in a second Jess. Give him a taffy. I come to announce to one and all that the day we all thought would never get here has arrived."
"KIRK: Arbor Day?"
"TAYLOR: No."
"KIRK: The Day of Reckoning?"
"TAYLOR: No"
"KIRK: The day the music died?"
"TAYLOR: Kirk."
"KIRK: Give me a taffy."
"TAYLOR: What?"
"KIRK: I've got a million of 'em. Give me a taffy!"
"TAYLOR: As I was saying, the big day has arrived. The opening of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store! Tomorrow from noon to six, there will be fun, balloons, ice cream, and old fashioned penny candy for just one dollar a piece. Come at noon, stay all day. . ."
"[Luke walks in]"
"JESS: Where the hell have you been? The place is a freaking zoo. Every table's full and I've got Sammy Davis Jr. here thinking it's the Desert Inn."
"LUKE: I had to run an errand."
"JESS: Everybody's complaining, we're out of ham, Caesar's suddenly decided to join the Slow Food Movement, and I've got a guy who's moved in at a table for four. He just sits, making it impossible for me to turn over that table, and if I can't turn over that table, then that cuts way back on my tips."
"LUKE: I'm sorry, don't you mean my tips?"
"JESS: What?"
"LUKE: You know where I was this morning?"
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: I was at Kyle's. His parents called me this morning."
"JESS: Oh, yeah?"
"LUKE: Seems a little party you went to last night got a little Animal House, huh?"
"JESS: Dean started it."
"LUKE: Oh, you're not really gonna use that one, are you?"
"JESS: Well, he did. He sucker punched me and I was just defending myself."
"LUKE: Oh, apparently you defended yourself all the way through the house and out into the front yard. You defended yourself with a chair that is now broken. You defended yourself with a coffee table. You defended yourself with an ottoman."
"JESS: I don't need a recap."
"LUKE: Do you have any idea how much damage you caused?"
"JESS: Dean caused it, too."
"LUKE: The place was trashed."
"JESS: Dean trashed it, too."
"LUKE: Are you trying to k*ll me?"
"JESS: Nope, it'll just be a perk."
"LUKE: Okay, well, here's the deal. From now on, every cent that you make here goes toward paying them back."
"JESS: Hey, what about -"
"LUKE: Dean's paying them back also."
"JESS: How do you know?"
"LUKE: Because he was at Kyle's house when I got there."
"JESS: You're kidding me."
"LUKE: He had already worked out a financial agreement with the parents and was helping them put a fence back up."
"JESS: Man, he's gonna make some woman a fine doormat someday."
"LUKE: You are making good on this, Jess."
"JESS: I have to get more coffee out of the store room."
"LUKE: Every cent is getting paid back. I never want those people calling me again."
"[The man at the table by the door gets up and leaves. Luke notices that the man left his wallet on the table. Luke picks it up, then walks out the door to catch him]"
"LUKE: Hey, you left your wallet! Hey!"
"[Luke opens the wallet and checks the ID]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks down the steps carrying some skirts. Rory is in the living room getting ready to leave]"
"LORELAI: Okay, here's the problem. Every single one of my skirts is either too long or too short for this season's acceptable lengths. Which means I either have to alter or shop."
"RORY: To be or not to be."
"LORELAI: Just wait 'til you hear what InStyle thinks of you, young lady. What time are you getting home tonight?"
"RORY: We have to go over the special graduation edition of the Franklin, and of course we're completely behind, partly because Paris can't let anything go to print unless she's proofed it a million times. Can you say crazy a**l micromanager?"
"LORELAI: Not five times fast."
"RORY: I'll be home by ten."
"LORELAI: That's all I needed to know."
"RORY: I forgot my notes."
"LORELAI: I put them in your bedroom."
"[Rory walks to her bedroom. Lorelai picks up the phone and dials a number]"
"EMILY: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hi, Mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yup, it's me. So, how are you?"
"EMILY: I'm fine."
"LORELAI: Good. How's Dad?"
"EMILY: He's fine."
"LORELAI: Also good."
"EMILY: May I speak with Rory please?"
"LORELAI: No, you can't speak with Rory."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because I called you."
"EMILY: So what?"
"LORELAI: You don't get to request a switch when a person calls you."
"EMILY: I'm sure she's standing right there."
"LORELAI: Not the point. If you wanna talk to Rory, you have to call. Then when I answer the phone, you can ask for Rory. But you didn't call, I called, so you cannot ask for Rory."
"EMILY: What do you want, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to see how you were. I haven't seen you for awhile."
"EMILY: Your choice."
"LORELAI: No, your choice, Mom."
"EMILY: You're the one who called off Friday night dinners."
"LORELAI: No, I'm the one who called off the obligation for Friday night dinners. You're the one who called off. . .ugh, you know what, I didn't call to argue."
"EMILY: Fine, let's not argue."
"LORELAI: Come on, Mom, this is silly. I mean, think back to before the whole Friday night dinner thing. We still had a relationship."
"EMILY: You mean the one where I would trick you into calling me by leaving a message on your answering machine saying I had something important to tell you, but I wouldn't include the details so you had no choice but to call me."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: And then when you did call, we'd talk about the weather, you'd ask about the DAR, and then you'd put Rory on the phone, even when she was too young to talk."
"LORELAI: It was not always like that."
"EMILY: It was always like that. Very well. The weather's fine, the DAR is staging a luncheon at the library next week. You already said I couldn't talk to Rory, so there, I think you've fulfilled your obligation."
"LORELAI: Okay, Mom, fine. Have a nice day."
"EMILY: Same to you."
"[They hang up. Lorelai's phone rings]"
"LORELAI: It's for you!"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Rory rushes into the Franklin meeting]"
"RORY: Sorry, sorry, sorry."
"PARIS: The issue is a disaster. It's our last issue of the Franklin and it's a complete disaster."
"RORY: I'm sure it's not that bad."
"PARIS: And that's why you won't need to Botox your frown lines on your nineteenth birthday. [to another student] Not that picture, no, put it down. Put it down now! [walks away]"
"[Rory walks over to Madeline and Louise]"
"RORY: How's it coming?"
"LOUISE: Very frustrating."
"MADELINE: We just can't seem to get exactly the right combination."
"LOUISE: All right. How about blue dress, blonde guy, black limo? Works best for me."
"MADELINE: Yes, however, green dress, red-haired guy, white limo works best for me."
"LOUISE: White limo with blonde guy totally doesn't work. It's too washed up."
"RORY: I'm assuming this conversation veered off of the cover page placement?"
"MADELINE: How about black-haired guy, green dress and tan limo?"
"LOUISE: Tan limo?"
"MADELINE: Good neutral backdrop."
"LOUISE: Well, this opens up a whole new set of options. Bring the golf team back in."
"RORY: Okay, why don't I just get these pesky Franklin articles out of your way. There we go."
"PARIS: What are you doing?"
"RORY: I am working on the front page placement."
"PARIS: What are they doing?"
"RORY: Staying true to who they are."
"LOUISE: Look, prom is once. It happens, it's photographed, and then it's there forever."
"MADELINE: Planning is essential."
"LOUISE: By the way, Paris, we left a space for you in the limo. However, we're gonna need the color of your dress."
"MADELINE: And a picture of Jamie."
"LOUISE: And the amount of flexibility that you have with the color of your dress."
"MADELINE: And with Jamie."
"PARIS: Thank you, but we've already made our plans for prom night. Jamie hired a private car to drive us to the prom. We'll go in, take the picture, depending on the level of lameness, dance. Then he's taking me to dinner at Antoine's, followed by a helicopter ride to join his parents out in Martha's Vineyard for the weekend."
"MADELINE: What color's the helicopter?"
"PARIS: As you were. [to Rory] So, have you figured out your plans for prom night yet?"
"RORY: Oh, no, but Stars Hollow is a much more casual kind of a prom. Less Cinderella, more Footloose."
"PARIS: Still a prom."
"RORY: It is still a prom."
"PARIS: I can't wait."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk down the street]"
"LORELAI: It's my own fault. I poked a slumbering bear with a stick. I reached out and initiated contact with Emily Gilmore. I get what I deserve."
"SOOKIE: You're a bad girl."
"LORELAI: You know what really stinks? They're having Rory over tonight for a movie night."
"SOOKIE: Movie night? That's your thing with her."
"LORELAI: Exactly. What's next? ""Stay home and dance around in your underwear to the Monkees' greatest hits"" night?"
"SOOKIE: I wouldn't put it past them to steal that, too."
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"[They read a sign on the bakery door that says Fran has passed away]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God."
"SOOKIE: Fran."
"LORELAI: Poor thing."
"SOOKIE: I don't believe it."
"LORELAI: Such a great lady."
"SOOKIE: Great lady."
"LORELAI: Eighty-three on her last birthday. A good long life."
"SOOKIE: We should all be so lucky."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna miss her."
"SOOKIE: Me, too. So. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"SOOKIE: I guess this'll put that old inn of hers on the market."
"LORELAI: Right, right. I mean, she wanted to keep it as long as she was alive, and now. . ."
"SOOKIE: Oh my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: You don't think that because we wanted the property so much, we k*ll Fran."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Through the power of our minds."
"LORELAI: No, no, we wished for the property, not this!"
"SOOKIE: Yeah, but you never know with karma."
"LORELAI: Look, we loved Fran, right?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, we did."
"LORELAI: And whether or not we get the Dragonfly Inn has nothing to do with her dying right now."
"SOOKIE: Right. . .sort of."
"LORELAI: Besides, we don't know what's happening with the inn."
"SOOKIE: Fran has no heirs."
"LORELAI: You never know. Some long lost gold-toothed cousin could come out of the woodwork, inherit it and turn it into a beauty salon or law offices."
"SOOKIE: Not our Dragonfly!"
"LORELAI: The point is, if we are meant to have the Dragonfly Inn, then we are meant to have it."
"SOOKIE: Right. Like Doris Day."
"LORELAI: Que sera."
"SOOKIE: Sera."
"LORELAI: Let's focus on Fran and how much we loved her. Not think about the inn at all."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: You're thinking about it."
"SOOKIE: Just about where to put the woodburning oven."
"LORELAI: We'll put it in the apartment that we're sharing in hell."
"SOOKIE: Let's buy flowers."
"LORELAI: Yeah, lots and lots of flowers."
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Lane and Mrs. Kim are polishing a set of chairs]"
"LANE: This is a really nice chair. Is it old?"
"MRS. KIM: Old enough."
"LANE: Well, it's really nice. I mean, the back is very sturdy and the legs are all the same length and the wood looks like it was a tree at some point, which is good for wood, 'cause it was."
"[There's a knock at the front door]"
"MRS. KIM: Could you get that please?"
"LANE: Yes, Mama."
"[Lane walks to the door and answers it. Dave is standing on the porch]"
"LANE: What are you doing here?"
"DAVE: I'm here to see your mother."
"LANE: What?"
"DAVE: Excuse me."
"LANE: Dave, Dave, wait!"
"[Dave walks into the house and over to Mrs. Kim]"
"DAVE: Excuse me, Mrs. Kim, I need to speak with you."
"MRS. KIM: I'm busy, David."
"DAVE: A few weeks ago you told me that Lane had a crush on me. Well, I have a crush on her, too. Now, I know you have very strict rules about dating and boys, but I just want you to know that I'm a good person. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I've never gotten a ticket, I'm healthy, I take care of myself, I floss. I never watch more than 30 minutes of television a night partly because I think it's a waste of time and partly because there's nothing on. I respect my parents, I do well in school, I never play video games in case they do someday prove that playing them can turn you into a serial k*ll. I don't drink coffee. I hate soda because the carbonation freaks me out. I'm happy to give up meat if you feel strongly about it. I don't mind wearing a tie. I enjoy playing those hymns on my guitar, and I really, really want to take your daughter to the prom."
"[Mrs. Kim doesn't say anything]"
"DAVE: Mrs. Kim? Please don't make me repeat that list again."
"MRS. KIM: Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass, but still remember what the Lord hath done."
"DAVE: Okay, thank you."
"[Dave and Lane walk outside.]"
"DAVE: Did you hear what she said?"
"LANE: Yes, I did."
"DAVE: What did it mean?"
"LANE: I don't know."
"DAVE: Was it a yes, was it a no?"
"LANE: I'm not sure."
"DAVE: Well, it's gotta be from the bible, right? So I'll just go home, do some research, look on the Internet, see what I can find. I'll call you when I know something."
"LANE: Okay."
"[He kisses her, then leaves]"
"LANE: I'm so writing him a song tonight."
"CUT TO MOTEL"
"[The man who left his wallet in the diner is in his motel room. There's a knock at the door, he answers it, Luke is there.]"
"LUKE: Left your wallet in the diner. [tosses it to him]"
"JIMMY: Oh, wow, did I? Look at that. I guess I did. Thanks for bringing it back."
"LUKE: No problem."
"JIMMY: You know, I really like this driver's license picture, too, so you could imagine what a drag it would be to have to replace it."
"LUKE: So what are you doing here, Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: Just passing through."
"LUKE: Passing through from where?"
"JIMMY: California."
"LUKE: California?"
"JIMMY: Yeah, I've been there for a few years now, seems to be working out."
"LUKE: Well, glad to hear it."
"JIMMY: Yeah."
"LUKE: So what are you doing here, Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: Nothing, really, just. . ."
"LUKE: He hasn't missed you."
"JIMMY: I'm sure that he hasn't."
"LUKE: Never says a word about you."
"JIMMY: I wouldn't expect he would."
"LUKE: Do you know why he doesn't miss you, Jimmy? Because you're a loser and nobody missed a loser."
"JIMMY: It's been seventeen years, Luke."
"LUKE: Oh, you remember how long it's been. I am impressed."
"JIMMY: Yeah, well, I always could count."
"LUKE: And your list of attributes ends there."
"JIMMY: Okay, so I guess we're not playing nice anymore."
"LUKE: You know, the last time I saw you is right after Liz gave birth. You were gonna go out and buy some diapers and meet us back at the apartment. Remember that?"
"JIMMY: Yes."
"LUKE: You went out, but you never came back."
"JIMMY: A lot of time has passed and a lot of things have changed."
"LUKE: Really, like what things? You?"
"JIMMY: Yes, me. Maybe. Why not?"
"LUKE: Oh, come on, you never called before. Why now? What do you want, you need money?"
"JIMMY: What?"
"LUKE: 'Cause he doesn't have any."
"JIMMY: I don't need money."
"LUKE: I don't have any either."
"JIMMY: I don't need money."
"LUKE: So the look is a choice?"
"JIMMY: No, I just wanted to. . .I don't know, see him."
"LUKE: Why now?"
"JIMMY: I don't know, I just thought it was time. You don't think it was time?"
"LUKE: You really want my opinion on this subject?"
"JIMMY: Luke, give me a break."
"LUKE: Give you a break? I am trying to keep this kid from falling off the face of the Earth. I'm trying to get him through school. I'm trying to give him a future. And I gotta be totally honest with you, Jimmy - I am not doing too well."
"JIMMY: No?"
"LUKE: No, and the last thing he needs is a special appearance by his father who can't be here for any good reason."
"JIMMY: There's no evil plan here. I have a job, a life. I just thought I'd come and..."
"LUKE: What? Say hello, see if he looks like you? Then what?"
"JIMMY: Well. . ."
"LUKE: What?"
"JIMMY: I don't know!"
"LUKE: Okay, well, while you're figuring it out, let me plant this little thought in your head - you do or say anything to upset Jess and make it harder for me to keep him on the right path, I'm gonna put your head through a wall. Any wall, you can pick the wall, but it's gonna be a wall, okay?"
"JIMMY: I just wanted to see him."
"LUKE: Well, you saw him. Now get outta here."

"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking toward the church for the funeral]"
"LORELAI: You know, Fran was one of the first people I met when we moved here."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: The first day here, I stopped in. . ."
"RORY: And asked her for directions to the inn."
"LORELAI: Yeah. She was so sweet. And oh my God, she loved you. I didn't think she was gonna let me leave the bakery with you. She just kept giving you cookies in a shameless attempt to buy your affections away from me. And let me tell you, for a couple weeks, it worked. For two weeks, you just kept staring at me like, ""You're the lady who took me away from the cookies. I'm gonna k*ll you."""
"RORY: Mom, can I just meet you at the church?"
"LORELAI: Why, what are you planning? Is it finally payback time?"
"RORY: I just need to stop in at Doose's and get something. Kleenex, we'll need Kleenex."
"LORELAI: Aw, I'll come with you."
"RORY: Um, well. . ."
"[They approach a bench where Miss Patty is sitting, crying]"
"LORELAI: Aw, Patty. . ."
"MISS PATTY: Now it all starts."
"LORELAI: What all starts, honey?"
"MISS PATTY: First Fran, then the rest of us."
"LORELAI: Aw, Patty, it's not the plague. It was just her time."
"MISS PATTY: I can't go."
"LORELAI: Yes, you can. Come on."
"MISS PATTY: No, just leave me."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna get her to the church."
"RORY: I'll meet you there. [walks away]"
"LORELAI: Come on, let's go."
"MISS PATTY: You know, it's times like these that you realize what is truly important in your life. I'm so glad I had all that sex."
"LORELAI: Hurry, honey."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[The diner is empty except for Jess at the counter. Rory starts to enter the diner, then stops herself. She walks away, then walks back to the door and stops herself again. Luke walks down into the diner and watches. Rory walks away. Jess sees her and starts to follow after her. He stops himself and walks back to the counter. He starts to go after her again, then walks back in and sees Luke watching him]"
"JESS: What are you looking at? [goes upstairs]"
"CUT TO CHURCH"
"[People are entering the church for the funeral. Taylor is greeting people at the door]"
"TAYLOR: Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed. Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed."
"[Everyone takes their seats, and the priest starts the service]"
"PRIEST: Welcome all. The large number of people here today is a testament to how much Fran Weston has touched each and every one of us. We'd like to start by inviting Marjorie Rogers, Fran's close friend, to share a few words with us."
"[Marjorie walks to the podium]"
"MARJORIE: In 1955, Fran opened Weston's Bakery. Back then, she was the new kid on the block, and soon thereafter, she hired me, a mother of three rugrats and a husband overseas, and we became best friends. Still are."
"LORELAI: That's so sweet."
"SOOKIE: You think we'll still be friends when we're dead?"
"LORELAI: I will if you will."
"MARJORIE: Fran was and is Stars Hollow. And to ensure that her love and spirit continue, Weston's Bakery will remain open and run by those who have Fran's heart in their hearts."
"[applause]"
"MARJORIE: Of course, Fran's family has been here long before even Fran. They opened the Dragonfly Inn back in 1893. The Dragonfly Inn was once regarded as the Violet Lady, the premiere inn in all of . . .[the microphone goes out]."
"LORELAI: What'd she say?"
"SOOKIE: I heard ""premiere inn"" then squat."
"LORELAI: Is she still talking about the inn?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"KIRK: Shh!"
"[the microphone fades in and out as Marjorie continues speaking]"
"MARJORIE: Inn . . .ortant role. . .ing. . .it's special. . .all who. . ."
"LORELAI: She said ""inn."""
"SOOKIE: And ""ortant"" and ""ing."""
"MARJORIE: . . .set. . .World w*r. . ."
"SOOKIE: She said World w*r."
"LORELAI: One or two? Where are we, where are we?"
"MARJORIE: . . .Fran. . ."
"SOOKIE: She's pointing to somebody."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's a man in a suit."
"SOOKIE: Does he have a gold tooth?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: You guys, people are turning."
"MARJORIE: . . .to you all. [leaves the podium]"
"SOOKIE: Did she say who gets the inn?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"[The priest returns to the podium and fixes the microphone]"
"PRIEST: Uh, thank you, Marjorie. And now, I'd like to point out that the time is twelve p.m., the time Fran would normally be opening her doors on Sunday after church, welcoming us to join her in friendship at Weston's Bakery. So, if we may at this time all bow our heads for a minute of silence to mark the passing of the soul and our dear departed friend."

"TAYLOR: No, no, the grand opening is canceled! Sorry, folks. [runs outside to stop the band] Stop, it is canceled. . .canceled!"
"CUT TO LATER AT THE FUNERAL"
"PRIEST: As we close, I'd like to honor a special request Fran had, and that is to take one final stroll around the Town Square before going to her final resting place. All those who would like to participate, please assemble outside."
"MRS. KIM: [to Lane] Walking with dead people not my thing. Let's go."
"RORY: Where's Sookie?"
"LORELAI: Just giving our condolences."
"RORY: And asking what you missed when the mike cut out?"
"LORELAI: And giving our condolences."
"[Sookie walks over to them]"
"SOOKIE: The man in the suit's name is Brink. He's a lawyer and he's here to get Fran's affairs in order."
"LORELAI: Do you think we can talk to him?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, but Lorelai, you have to get back to the inn and I've got those B&Bers waiting at my home to learn how to make jam."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, let's get him now."
"SOOKIE: I think our window of opportunity just slammed shut."
"[They see the lawyer helping carry the casket out of the church]"
"LORELAI: Great."
"SOOKIE: Now what?"
"LORELAI: We very respectfully hover in his vicinity until the walk is over. . ."
"SOOKIE: Then we will politely ask him to get in touch with us."
"LORELAI: Yes. Coming?"
"RORY: No, you guys go ahead. I'll be in the back of the line so that when the earth opens up and swallows you whole, I'll be here to tell a story."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory walks out of the church and Dean walks up to her.]"
"DEAN: Hey, Rory."
"RORY: Oh, hey. You were in there?"
"DEAN: Yeah. I got here late so I kind of just hung in the back."
"RORY: It was nice of you to come."
"DEAN: Well, she was a nice lady."
"RORY: Yeah, she was."
"DEAN: Listen, uh, can I talk to you for a sec? We'll catch up, I promise."
"RORY: Sure."
"DEAN: Good. Okay, um. . ."
"RORY: What?"
"DEAN: Come on."
"RORY: Dean, what are you doing?"
"DEAN: Okay. Uh, are you ready?"
"RORY: Yes, I'm ready."
"DEAN: I asked Lindsay to marry me."
"RORY: You. . .you. . ."
"DEAN: And she said yes."
"RORY: She. . .she.. ."
"DEAN: So what do you think?"
"RORY: I. . . I. . ."
"DEAN: I know, who woulda thought? I mean, it's weird, but Lindsay's amazing and I asked and she said yes, so. . .I'm getting married. Say something."
"RORY: Why?"
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: No, I don't mean why, I mean, why now?"
"DEAN: Why not now?"
"RORY: Well, you're eighteen, first of all."
"DEAN: So?"
"RORY: So, you're young. I mean, you haven't even gone to college yet. Oh my God, you are still going to college, aren't you?"
"DEAN: Yes, Rory, I'm still going to college."
"RORY: Well, how. . ."
"DEAN: Lindsay's gonna go with me."
"RORY: But Dean, you're going to be studying and taking classes, you need to focus on that. I mean, you don't even know what you wanna do yet. And you guys haven't even been going out for that long. I mean, why don't you just date for awhile? Dating's fun."
"DEAN: Thank you."
"RORY: For what?"
"DEAN: For your deep heartfelt congratulations."
"RORY: You just. . .you took me by surprise."
"DEAN: So what? It's good news, you can't just be happy for me?"
"RORY: I can. I am. I just. . ."
"DEAN: You know what, I'm sorry if you have a crappy relationship with Jess."
"RORY: Hey, that has -"
"DEAN: And I'm sorry if he treats you like dirt and everyone hates him, but that was your choice. I have a great girlfriend and I am really happy, and when you dumped me for that jackass, I thought I'd never be happy again."
"RORY: Jess does not treat me like dirt."
"DEAN: Whatever. I just wanted you to hear it from me before it got out. Now you know, so, um, have a nice life. [walks away]"
"RORY: Jess does not treat me like dirt!"
"CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs. Kim is making tea in the kitchen. Lane walks in]"
"LANE: Mama, do you need any help?"
"MRS. KIM: No, thank you."
"LANE: I could get out the soy scones."
"MRS. KIM: If you like."
"LANE: Tofutter?"
"MRS. KIM: Fine."
"LANE: Mama, I'm really sorry about the other night. I did everything wrong, everything you taught me not to do. I lied to you, I let you down. I never intended to do that and I don't know how to fix it, but I'm going to try my hardest because I am so, so sorry. I'll be upstairs if you need me. I'm gonna go in my room, gonna iron my dress for church and I'm gonna think about what I've done."
"[Lane starts to go up to her room. The doorbell rings and Mrs. Kim answers the door. Dave is on the porch]"
"DAVE: I stayed up all night. I read the entire bible cover to cover. I don't know what it means."
"MRS. KIM: David."
"DAVE: You have to tell me what it means. Is it yes, is it no? I can't feel my right elbow anymore. I don't even know why, but I can't."
"MRS. KIM: David."
"DAVE: Please, just tell me. I'm so tired."
"MRS. KIM: It's not from the bible."
"DAVE: What?"
"MRS. KIM: It's Shakespeare, Henry VI. I like to goof off now and then, too, you know."
"DAVE: Shakespeare."
"MRS. KIM: That is a very difficult this to do, reading the bible in one night. I myself have only done it three times. You need great determination and excellent light. I'm very impressed. All right."
"DAVE: All right what?"
"MRS. KIM: You can go to the prom, but you cannot get married."
"DAVE: That seems fair to me."
"LANE: And me! The person who is going upstairs to think about what she's done."
"MRS. KIM: Lane is grounded until the prom and for two months after. You may call her on the phone every other day for ten minutes and that is all. Understand?"
"DAVE: Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mrs. Kim."
"[Mrs. Kim walks away. Lane and Dave smile at each other]"
"MRS. KIM: Lane!"
"LANE: Thinking about what I've done!"
"CUT TO TOWN SQUARE"
"[A line of mourners are slowly following behind the pall bearers carrying Fran's casket]"
"LORELAI: So apparently we're all supposed to walk like Fran."
"SOOKIE: It's almost four."
"LORELAI: Okay, I've gotta take some initiative here."
"SOOKIE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Just focus on the ground and look lost in grief."
"[they move up so they are standing alongside Fran's lawyer]"
"LORELAI: It was a nice service."
"LAWYER: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: And this is a really nice idea, the walk around the square."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, a great idea. I may steal it when I die. You know, ask them to walk me around a benefit counter. Might freak out the makeover girls, but it's -"
"SOOKIE: It's nice."
"LORELAI: Really nice. So listen, my name is Lorelai Gilmore and this is Sookie St. James."
"SOOKIE: Hi."
"LORELAI: I know this isn't exactly the best time for this, but we were wondering if you had any idea what's going to happen with the Dragonfly."
"SOOKIE: Because we want it!"
"LORELAI: Sookie and I actually talked to Fran about buying it once."
"SOOKIE: We work in the Independence Inn now."
"LAWYER: The one that b*rned down?"
"LORELAI: Yes, but that was just an accident. It was a bad wire."
"SOOKIE: A bad, bad wire."
"LORELAI: It could've happened to anyone and should in no way reflect our inn-running abilities."
"LAWYER: Yes, well, do you think we could discuss this a little later? This is a little heavy and I sort of need to focus."
"LORELAI: Oh, let me help you here. [grabs onto the casket] Ooh, wow, for a little woman. . .Sookie, will you just. . ."
"SOOKIE: Oh, right. [helps carry the casket]"
"LORELAI: Anyway, we were just wondering, did she leave the Dragonfly to anyone?"
"LAWYER: No, she didn't."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay. And do you know what the family wants to do with it?"
"LAWYER: We haven't talked in depth about it, but I'm pretty sure they're gonna sell it."
"LORELAI: Well, we would really like to buy it."
"SOOKIE: And keep it as an inn."
"LORELAI: Yes, a wonderful inn."
"SOOKIE: Dedicated to Fran."
"LORELAI: Yes, but keep it the Dragonfly."
"SOOKIE: And we promise not to burn it down."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, that's right. Hey, we could put that in the agreement. Ow. . ."
"LAWYER: Uh, here, why don't you. . ."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Anyway, what do you say?"
"LAWYER: Well. . ."
"KIRK: Excuse me, but you're blocking her view."
"LORELAI: Oh, sorry Kirk, sorry. So you were saying?"
"LAWYER: I'll tell you what, you contact me on Monday and we can discuss this. As far as I'm concerned, if the check clears, it's all yours."
"LORELAI: It's all ours."
"SOOKIE: It's all ours."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Jess is cleaning up when Jimmy walks in]"
"JESS: We're closed. Learn to read. You're the loser coffee guy."
"JIMMY: Well, not as cool as Bono, but I'll take it."
"JESS: We're -"
"JIMMY: Closed. Yeah, I heard."
"JESS: Okay, so we're still -"
"JIMMY: I'm your father."
"JESS: - closed. What?"
"JIMMY: I'm your. . ."
"JESS: Are you sure?"
"JIMMY: Am I. . .yes, I'm sure. I didn't mean to spring this on you. I thought Luke would've told you that I -"
"JESS: Luke would've told me?"
"JIMMY: Well, yeah, he came to see me last night. He didn't tell you. That's obvious because you're still doing the staring with the frown and. . .you look different."
"JESS: You want some coffee?"
"JIMMY: Sure. Thanks."
"JESS: It's old."
"JIMMY: Okay."
"[They sit down at a table and both silently listen to a song on the radio for a minute]"
"JIMMY: I gotta go."
"[Jimmy quickly gets up and leaves]"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street]"
"LORELAI: I was negotiating at a funeral."
"RORY: I saw."
"LORELAI: Which might've been the most inappropriate thing to happen today until that gnat flew into Kirk's mouth and he freaked and dropped the casket."
"RORY: It was a nice save."
"LORELAI: I'm feeling so weird. I'm completely sad about Fran, but the inn. . .it's really gonna happen."
"RORY: Yeah, seems like it."
"LORELAI: Hey, come here."
"[they stop in front of a store with a prom dress in the window]"
"LORELAI: That one would look great on you."
"RORY: Oh, I don't know."
"LORELAI: We should come back tomorrow and try it on."
"RORY: Maybe."
"LORELAI: Hey, prom's coming up, kid. We need to get you a dress. Unless you want me to make you one."
"RORY: No, that's okay."
"LORELAI: Maybe we could hit the mall tomorrow after school. I could meet you in Hartford and we could go to a fancy store where they'll follow us around like we're thieves."
"RORY: I don't wanna talk about dresses anymore."
"LORELAI: We've only been talking about dresses for two minutes."
"RORY: Well, it feels like longer."
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: And I don't know if I even need a dress, okay, 'cause I don't even know if I'm going to the prom."
"LORELAI: I thought Jess agreed."
"RORY: Well, that was before."
"LORELAI: Before what?"
"RORY: Before the party, before the fight, before the thing in Kyle's bedroom."
"LORELAI: Okay, come with me."
"[they both get into the Jeep]"
"LORELAI: Okay, we left off with the thing in Kyle's bedroom."
"RORY: I don't understand. One minute he's happy, then he's not. And he doesn't tell me anything ever. I mean, you're supposed to tell your girlfriend things. That's the whole point of having a girlfriend, isn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it is. Now, Kyle's bedroom, what happened there?"
"RORY: And I'm so tired of fighting. Or not even fighting because he won't fight. He just gets mad and disappears and then comes back and I don't like how I feel and I don't like what I do."
"LORELAI: Like what you do where, in Kyle's bedroom?"
"RORY: I don't wanna feel like this, I don't wanna sit around wondering when we're going to talk, if he's mad, why he's mad. I hate this. I really, really -"
"LORELAI: Honey, you gotta tell Mommy what happened in Kyle's bedroom!"
"RORY: Jess was upset and I went to look for him and we were kissing and then it seemed like he wanted to. . ."
"LORELAI: Did you?"
"RORY: No, I didn't. And then he got all weird like he was mad at me."
"LORELAI: Hey, if he was mad at you because you wouldn't have sex with him, then he's a jerk."
"RORY: I know that, but I don't even know if that's why he's mad at me. I don't know if he's mad at me. I don't know anything because he won't talk. He just sulks then disappears, and just when you're through with him, he shows up at hockey games with Distiller tickets."
"LORELAI: Distiller tickets? What Distiller tickets?"
"RORY: Oh, that's right, you don't know about that because I didn't tell you because I was embarrassed because I didn't wanna be that girl and you don't want me to be that girl, but after the hockey game, I was that girl."
"LORELAI: What girl? Help me, drag me along, honey."
"RORY: The girl who lets her boyfriend treat her like dirt and then lies to her mom about it."
"LORELAI: Okay, you need a breath here."
"RORY: Something's going on with him and it's been going on for awhile."
"LORELAI: You can't make him talk, Rory. He has to want to."
"RORY: But why doesn't he want to?"
"LORELAI: Because it's probably hard for him."
"[There is a car waiting to take their parking spot. Lorelai leans out the car window to yell at the driver]"
"LORELAI: Hey, we're not leaving. We're gonna live in this car and we're gonna die in this car, so find another frickin' spot. [to Rory] Honey. . ."
"RORY: I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I'm tired of talking about it. I'm just. . .tired."
"LORELAI: Okay. So. . ."
"RORY: Nothing happened."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Jess is sitting at the table, Luke walks in]"
"LUKE: Hey. You hungry? I can make us some eggs."
"JESS: So I hear you went to see my father last night."
"LUKE: Yeah, I did."
"JESS: Were you gonna tell me?"
"LUKE: He came by?"
"JESS: He came by."
"LUKE: I didn't think he'd have the guts."
"JESS: So what were you thinking?"
"LUKE: Jess, I don't like your father very much."
"JESS: So because you don't like him, that means I can't know he's here?"
"LUKE: You know he's here."
"JESS: No thanks to you."
"LUKE: Shouldn't have come from me in the first place."
"JESS: So what, you don't think you owed it to me to tell me, prepare me?"
"LUKE: No, Jess, I didn't. With everything that's going on here with you, I kinda hoped he'd just walk away, but. . .once again, Jimmy makes the wrong move. What a shock."
"JESS: Oh, who the hell are you to decide what the right move is?"
"LUKE: I'm the one who's saving your ass constantly. I'm the one who just wrote a check to Kyle's father so he wouldn't press charges against you. I'm the one trying to knock some sense into that thick head of yours about the future."
"JESS: Oh, here we go."
"LUKE: You don't take anything seriously. That's why you're doing so crappy in school. You're smart enough, you read more than anyone I've ever seen. There's no reason why you should be barely graduating."
"JESS: I'm not."
"LUKE: You're not what?"
"JESS: I'm not graduating."
"LUKE: Yes, you are."
"JESS: No, I'm not."
"LUKE: Yes, you are."
"JESS: No, I'm not."
"LUKE: Yes, you are, because we had an agreement that if you were gonna live here, you were gonna go to school and you were gonna graduate."
"JESS: Well, I didn't and I'm not."
"LUKE: What is wrong with you? What, did you do this just to spite me?"
"JESS: Look, forget it, it's done."
"LUKE: What's your life now? Wal-Mart full time, that's your great future? Gonna take the plunge and buy yourself a second blue vest?"
"JESS: Maybe, why not? What's wrong with it? I mean, it's no diner."
"LUKE: Hey, I own this business, kid! I built it, this is mine! I'm not at the mercy of some boss waiting and hoping to be chosen employee of the month for a couple extra hundred bucks and a plaque. I'm always employee of the month. I'm employee of the year, of the century, of the universe. You should be so lucky to have a job like mine. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. You're gonna live here one more year, you're gonna quit you job, you're gonna take twelfth grade over again, and you will graduate."
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: I'm not playing with you here, Jess. You quit your job, you go to school."
"JESS: I am not going back to school!"
"LUKE: So that's it?"
"JESS: Yeah, that's it."
"LUKE: Then you gotta go."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai has set up breakfast on the kitchen table; Rory walks out of her room]"
"RORY: I thought I smelled coffee."
"LORELAI: Good morning your highness. I trust you slept well."
"RORY: And to what do I owe this lovely display of domesticity?"
"LORELAI: Well, being brilliant and all, I figured you would probably still not be in the mood to go to Luke's this morning, so I thought we'd have a nice little breakfast here."
"RORY: Wow, okay. Hey."
"LORELAI: Good?"
"RORY: These are from Luke's."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: You got up this morning, went to Luke's and brought this back."
"LORELAI: Well, I sure as hell am not gonna cook."
"RORY: They're good, thank you."
"LORELAI: Put 'em on a plate just the way you like 'em."
"[Rory looks at the newspaper]"
"RORY: Well, there it is."
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Lister announce the engagement of their daughter Lindsay Ann to Dean Forrester, son of Randy and Barbara Forrester."" My God, they're a good looking couple. If their kids can sing there's no stopping 'em."
"RORY: I still don't understand why they need to get married."
"LORELAI: Maybe they have to get married before he grows so tall she won't be able to talk to him anymore."
"RORY: I really do want him to be happy."
"LORELAI: I know. You're good in that department."
"RORY: Some people get married young and everything turns out fine."
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"RORY: That'd be nice."
"LORELAI: Well, we'll keep a good thought."
"RORY: Hey, here's a picture of Kirk pinned by the casket."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, that's a good one."
"RORY: Man, it's bad enough this had to happen, but his pants splitting on top of it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I hope he never takes too close a look at his life."
"RORY: Amen. So this goes on the fridge, right?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, absolutely."
"RORY: Good."
"CUT TO BUS"
"[Rory is on her way to school. The bus stops and several people get off, and she notices Jess sitting in the back. She walks over to him]"
"RORY: Hey."
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Can I sit?"
"JESS: Uh, sure, sit. I thought you took an earlier bus."
"RORY: My first class got canceled today."
"JESS: Oh. So what's been going on?"
"RORY: Nothing much. Fran died."
"JESS: I heard."
"RORY: I went to her funeral yesterday."
"JESS: Luke went, too."
"RORY: I saw him there."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"RORY: He was in the back."
"JESS: I can't go to the prom. I couldn't get tickets."
"RORY: Oh."
"JESS: Sorry."
"[the bus stops]"
"RORY: This is my stop."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: So, you'll call me?"
"JESS: Yeah, I'll call you."
"[Rory gets off the bus. Jess pulls a book out of a large duffel bag and the bus pulls away]"

"OPEN AT WESTON'S BAKERY"
"[Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table with books spread open in front of them]"
"LORELAI: ""Where's the ladies room?"" ""More coffee, please."" ""Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"""
"RORY: We do not need to know how to say ""Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"""
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, we do."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: When we're in Spain, we need to know how to say, ""Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"" When in France, ""Does Johnny Depp live near here?"""
"RORY: When in Rome, ""Does Gore Vidal live near here?"""
"LORELAI: You know, you look like me, yet my ways are completely lost on you. Come on, honey, put that down. You've been studying all day."
"RORY: I can't put it down, I've got finals coming up."
"LORELAI: I know you have finals coming up, but you also have a piece of pie sitting there that you've been completely ignoring."
"RORY: Just let me get to the end of this chapter."
"LORELAI: Oh, fine. Hey, how important do you think it is to be able to say, ""Help, I'm bleeding from the head""?"
"RORY: Just bring the phrase books."
"LORELAI: No. If we learn all the phrases we need, then the phrase books are one less thing we have to lug around."
"RORY: We will never be able to learn all the phrases in every language that we're going to need. Bring the books."
"LORELAI: We can learn enough. Plus, doesn't everybody speak English over there anyway?"
"RORY: Ugly American, party of one."
"LORELAI: Fine, we'll bring the books."
"RORY: Okay, five minutes for pie."
"LORELAI: Finally."
"[Lane walks in and sits down with them]"
"LANE: They're here, I've got them."
"LORELAI: You've got what?"
"LANE: The brochures for my college."
"RORY: You seem chipper."
"LANE: I am. I have decided to make this whole Seventh Day Adventist College experience a good one. I'm gonna look on the bright side, find the silver lining, and make myself some lemonade."
"LORELAI: Well, good for you."
"RORY: The campus looks pretty."
"LORELAI: Very pretty."
"LANE: It's got two huge parks with gardens and lakes."
"LORELAI: Two parks."
"LANE: One for boys and one for girls."
"RORY: Huh."
"LANE: And you know, I had originally thought that this was gonna be a suffocating place with out of date rules and insane restrictions, but boy was I wrong. For example, curfew is up to 9:30. 9:45 if you're going for your Masters. Makeup will be permitted, as long as it identically matches your skin tone. And owning a Rolling Stones CD is no longer grounds for expulsion. You can work the demerits off in the campus clean-up crew."
"LORELAI: There's a separate park for boys?"
"LANE: My life is over."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, no, I didn't say that."
"LANE: You didn't have to. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: Well, it is over."
"RORY: It's not over."
"LORELAI: Every kid in that brochure was awkward and panicked. It looked like the Academy Award audience during Michael Moore's speech."
"RORY: Hey, why don't you add the phrase ""Just sit there and look pretty"" to that list of yours there, okay? I've gotta go back to studying."
"LORELAI: ""Does that sexy guy in the Peugeot ad who had a bit part in Armageddon live near here?"""
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks down the steps carrying her shoes. She quietly walks to the kitchen and fills up the coffeepot with water, then walks over to the coffee maker as Rory walks out of her bedroom]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: [startled] Oh! Oh, God, Rory, you scared me."
"RORY: Sorry."
"LORELAI: I've been sneaking around here like an idiot trying not to wake you up."
"RORY: I've been up for hours."
"LORELAI: Why? Did you have a bad dream? The one where you finally meet Christiane Amanpour and she's really stupid?"
"RORY: No, I realized last night that at this rate, I will never finish all the work I have to do."
"LORELAI: What work?"
"RORY: What work? What work, she asks."
"LORELAI: Well, you know me and that dippy Christiane, takes a little while to catch up."
"RORY: Here. [hands her a list]"
"LORELAI: Things to do before graduation. A list, of course. Study for finals, senior breakfast, senior awards, finish final edition of the Franklin, organize a new student government, convince Paris to give up student gavel."
"RORY: Oh, and I forgot - man the yearbook distribution table this afternoon at the stupid Senior Palooza. Unbelievable."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll be manning the Booster Club Grad Night table at the same time, so we can feel stupid and abused together."
"RORY: I can't finish all this and sleep at the same time."
"LORELAI: You have to sleep, it's what keeps you pretty."
"RORY: Who cares if I'm pretty if I fail my finals?"
"LORELAI: Okay, you've got this so completely backwards. What is all this?"
"RORY: Hm? Oh, I found that if I focus too much on one subject, I start to get a little punchy. This way, when I hit Bolshevik Revolution overload, I just shift over here and, oh, hello, Anne Boleyn is going down, and then when that gets too depressing, it's right over to calculus."
"LORELAI: Saving the party subject for last, huh?"
"RORY: This shifting back and forth seems to produce better results."
"LORELAI: I think you're pushing yourself too hard."
"RORY: I made out a schedule. Every single moment of every single day from now until graduation is accounted for."
"LORELAI: You left off the Kiwanis Luncheon."
"RORY: I did? Are you sure?"
"LORELAI: It's on Monday."
"RORY: How could I forget the Kiwanis Luncheon? They gave me their scholarship."
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, a two hundred and fifty dollar scholarship. That'll keep you in microwave popcorn for a week."
"RORY: I'll just have to move something around. And I'll have to work Grandma in."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"RORY: Grandma called and asked if I could come over and help her pick out a dress to wear to my graduation."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: I have to."
"LORELAI: Rory, my mother's been dressing herself for years and she has yet to show up at a function with her bra on the outside of her clothing."
"RORY: She asked, I can't say no."
"LORELAI: Tell her about the koala bears. She'll understand."
"[Luke appears at the back door window and waves to get Lorelai's attention]"
"RORY: Please stop making fun of them. We need every cent we can get. Yale is expensive."
"LORELAI: I know Yale is expensive."
"RORY: Well, we haven't heard from Yale financial aid yet."
"[Luke gestures for Lorelai to come outside]"
"LORELAI: We will, relax."
"RORY: Well, we had better hear from them soon because I have a deposit to send in for my room and I have a bunch of supplies to buy and I wanna get all of that out of the way before we go to Europe, otherwise I'll be obsessing about it the entire time."
"LORELAI: Okay, uh, listen, I'm gonna go out and get the paper."
"RORY: Okay, well, don't show it to me because I have no time for recreational reading until June."
"LORELAI: Hey, could we move your, uh, chill session from four o'clock tomorrow afternoon to, uh, right now? That'd be great, thanks."
"[Lorelai walks out the back door where Luke is waiting for her]"
"LORELAI: Okay, um, little tip - the whole stalking thing works infinitely better when you don't actually smash your face in the window."
"LUKE: I need to talk to you."
"LORELAI: Come inside."
"LUKE: No, Rory's in there."
"LORELAI: Since when are you scared of Rory? 'Cause seriously, Luke, I think you can take her."
"LUKE: I just need to tell you something. Can she hear us?"
"LORELAI: Through the walls? No, I put some kryptonite in her waffles. We're good."
"LUKE: Come over here."
"LORELAI: You're freaking out the freaks this morning."
"LUKE: Jess is gone."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: And I don't think he's coming back."
"LORELAI: What do you mean gone? Like gone gone?"
"LUKE: Exactly like gone gone."
"LORELAI: But when?"
"LUKE: Last night, this morning, I don't know. I went up there to get some money out of the safe and I noticed that all of his stuff was gone."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, forget it. I'm through with him. He's eighteen, he can do whatever the hell he wants. He's on his own, I'm through."
"LORELAI: Luke."
"LUKE: No, it's a relief. That kid was driving me crazy. Let him make his own way from now on. Let him see how far that smart mouth of his gets him without someone watching his back. I couldn't be more relieved. I'm just worried about Rory. I assume she doesn't know."
"LORELAI: She hasn't said anything."
"LUKE: I can tell her if you want me to."
"LORELAI: No, it's okay. I can do it. I just have to figure out when. She's got a lot of things on her mind right now."
"LUKE: Well, don't wait too long. She'll notice eventually."
"LORELAI: Yes, okay. Well, thanks for coming over."
"LUKE: No problem."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: I failed him."
"LORELAI: You did not fail him. You supported him, you defended him, you gave him a chance, and if he chose not to take it, there's nothing more you could do."
"LUKE: Yeah. Well, I should go."
"LORELAI: Do you have any idea where he went?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I got a pretty good idea."
"[Luke leaves. Lorelai walks back into the house through the front door, and Rory walks up to her]"
"RORY: Hey, there is no chill time scheduled for four o'clock tomorrow, and the one thing I really don't have time for are your jokes, missy. [walks back to kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Later's good."
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess gets off a bus and starts walking down the street]"
"MAN: Do you need some help, friend?"
"JESS: Nope."
"MAN: Lived here 25 years. I can certainly point you in a direction, make your journey easier. [Jess walks away] Enjoy this beautiful day."
"JESS: [to himself] I'll have the alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast."
"[Jess stands on the beach and watches the ocean]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai pulls up and checks the mailbox. She opens a letter.]"
"CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is on the phone in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Yes, I've been holding for Mr. Hennings. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. . .oh, great, hi. Listen, um, I just received this letter saying that my daughter did not qualify for financial aid. Rory Gilmore. . .Uh huh. . .Okay, yes, we did recently receive seventy-five thousand dollars, but, uh, here's the thing - that money is gone. I gave it to my parents, so I don't have it anymore, I swear. You could come over here and search me. We could open a bottle of wine and put on some Motown and. . . Uh, yes, that was very inappropriate. Look, um, I owed my parents that money because they helped me put Rory through Chilton, and I wanted her to go to Chilton so that she could get into. . .well, Harvard, but then Harvard became Yale - long story - and now that she's gotten into Yale, I paid them back for Chilton. Just kind of a funny, wacky circle we could all laugh about someday. . . Yes, but, since I don't have the money anymore, it just seems like it shouldn't count. There must be something we can do. I mean, Rory is the most deserving kid there is, just seriously. You know, I don't know if you know the Kiwanis, but they gave her their scholarship and. . .mmhmm. . .I understand. . .okay. . .well, we'll just have to figure something out. . . thank you. Goodbye."
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess walks up to a house. He starts to walk through the front gate, but a bunch of dogs run up and start barking at him.]"
"JESS: Hey! Hello, is anybody home? Hey!"
"[a woman is standing on the roof of the house]"
"SASHA: [to dogs] Pipe down! [to Jess] You selling something?"
"JESS: No. Does Jimmy Mariano live here?"
"SASHA: Does he owe you money?"
"JESS: No, I'm his. . .Jess. I'm Jess."
"SASHA: Jess?"
"[a dog starts barking]"
"JESS: Jess Marian -"
"SASHA: Frodo, back off now! I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
"JESS: I just wanna see Jimmy, okay?"
"SASHA: Hey, did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?"
"JESS: Yes."
"SASHA: Remember when they go to the Emerald City and they ring the bell and the guy with the beard stuck his head out and they said that they wanted to see the wizard, and he said no, and they said, 'She's got the ruby slippers', and he said 'Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in.'"
"JESS: Yes."
"SASHA: Well, I'm the guy with the beard and I'm saying the no unless you can come up with the ruby slippers."
"JESS: I'm his son."
"SASHA: His son?"
"JESS: Yes, his son."
"SASHA: Well, that's a horse of a different color. Come on in."
"JESS: Do they bite?"
"SASHA: Just those two. [walks away]"
"JESS: Which two? Hey, which two? Great. I swear I will bite you back."
"[He walks into the yard. The woman walks over to greet him]"
"SASHA: I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming."
"JESS: Neither did I."
"SASHA: I'm Sasha. This is Angus, Chowder, Rufus, Legolas, Caligula, Mudball, General Lee, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis and Spot. Jimmy's not here right now."
"JESS: Okay, well, I can just hang out, walk around for awhile. Just tell me what time he gets home."
"SASHA: Why don't you come in? I'll call his work."
"JESS: Oh, well. . ."
"[they walk inside]"
"JESS: You have a lot of pets."
"SASHA: Ah, they're not all mine."
"JESS: No?"
"SASHA: No, some of 'em followed me home, some of 'em hang out, some of 'em just needed a place to crash. They drive Jimmy crazy, actually, but what can you do? Someone's gotta take care of 'em, right? I'm just gonna try and track him down, so just wander."
"[Sasha walks to a phone and picks it up]"
"SASHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. [she dials a number] Okay. Lee, hi, I'm looking for Jimmy. . . okay, I'll hold. . ."
"[Jess looks around the house]"
"JESS: Clowns, cats, dogs. I wonder where his tap shoes are."
"[He walks into another room and looks around. He opens a cabinet door and finds a young girl reading inside]"
"JESS: Whoa!"
"[Sasha comes to the doorway]"
"SASHA: He wasn't at work, but his guy said he'll be back any second. Lil, Koko's gonna come over and stay with you while I'm gone, okay? And put those books back in there when you're done, I mean it. Ready?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"LILY: Hey. . . the door."
"JESS: Sorry."
"[Jess shuts the cabinet door and leaves]"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Louise and Madeline are talking in the hallway]"
"LOUISE: Shut up."
"MADELINE: I swear."
"LOUISE: Jean jackets are out? How is that possible?"
"MADELINE: I just opened the magazine and there it was."
"LOUISE: This is horrible. Who decides these things?"
"MADELINE: Marie Claire, apparently."
"[Rory walks over]"
"LOUISE: I feel so helpless. Did you hear? Jean jackets are out."
"RORY: Out of where?"
"MADELINE: Vogue."
"LOUISE: No, Marie Claire."
"MADELINE: Whatever. We still can't wear them."
"RORY: Oh, you guys, thank you so much for passing out the yearbooks for me. I really need the study time."
"LOUISE: No problem."
"RORY: Do you want me to at least help you bring the boxes in?"
"MADELINE: Oh, we've got that taken care of."
"[Two guys walk by carrying some boxes]"
"BOY: Halfway through."
"LOUISE: Yeah, well, hurry up, 'cause we need to get started."
"MADELINE: God, he carries those boxes sexy."
"[Rory's cell phone rings]"
"RORY: [answers] Hello?"
"EMILY: Rory, you haven't returned my calls."
"RORY: Oh, Grandma, I'm so sorry. I've been really busy."
"EMILY: I don't care how busy you get, young lady, you have to call your grandmother back."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"EMILY: I won't be around forever, you know."
"RORY: I'm really sorry."
"EMILY: When are you coming over? I need to discuss what to wear to your graduation. I thought about a suit."
"RORY: A suit seems nice."
"EMILY: But perhaps it's too formal."
"RORY: Formal's fine."
"EMILY: Well, what are your friends' families wearing?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"EMILY: Can you find out?"
"RORY: Um, sure, hold on. [to Louise] Louise, what's your grandmother wearing to graduation?"
"LOUISE: Hopefully the pearls I get when she kicks."
"RORY: [to Emily] Why don't I just come over?"
"EMILY: Oh, that would be wonderful. Today?"
"RORY: Yes, as soon as I can get away."
"EMILY: And bring a color swatch of your cap and gown so I don't clash."
"RORY: Bye, Grandma."
"[Rory hangs up, then dials a number]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: I just got another call from Grandma."
"LORELAI: Rory, no."
"RORY: I'm gonna go over there now."
"LORELAI: And leave me here alone?"
"RORY: Where are you? I can't even see you."
"LORELAI: I'm over here by the Old Spice ad."
"[Rory walks to the doorway of the cafeteria and sees Lorelai across the room]"
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi. Come over."
"RORY: I have to go."
"LORELAI: You can't come over and talk for one second?"
"RORY: The minute I walk into that room, I'm suddenly gonna have to sign yearbooks, and since I'm severely crunched for time, I'm gonna have to resort to classic clams like, ""Hey, have a good summer. Let's keep in touch. Best friends forever,"" and I do not wanna be that person. Plus, Paris will immediately shanghai me and give me a million things to do."
"LORELAI: You know what, you need to stop being intimidated by that girl. You're going to college for God's sake. You need to be able to stand up for yourself and say, you know, ""Paris, go. . ."""
"[Paris walks up behind her]"
"PARIS: Hey."
"LORELAI: Paris!"
"PARIS: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I was just. . .the phone rang. . .your hair is really shiny."
"PARIS: We're not even set up yet. The box isn't out, the tickets aren't in order. Where's the list?"
"LORELAI: Uh, it's uh. . .in my purse."
"PARIS: Well, terrific. I can't think of a better place for the list to be except, oh, maybe out here on the table where we could actually look at it."
"LORELAI: Your hair is really shiny."
"PARIS: I'm going to go make the rounds. I'll be back in a minute. Have you seen Rory?"
"LORELAI: No."
"PARIS: I'll go look outside."
"[Paris walks away]"
"LORELAI: [to Rory on phone] Run, run, run!"
"RORY: Okay, I'm gonna be at Grandma's for about an hour. Can you pick me up?"
"LORELAI: If Paris hasn't had me flogged, then yes, I'll be there."
"RORY: Thank you. Bye."
"[they hang up]"
"LORELAI: Please, God, tell me I didn't forget the list."
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess and Sasha are walking down the street]"
"JESS: So the kid in the bookcase back there. . ."
"SASHA: Lily."
"JESS: Is she yours?"
"SASHA: Mine, yes. Not Jimmy's."
"JESS: Oh."
"SASHA: I was married for the longest minute and a half in the world and. . .[to woman walking by] . . .hey sweetie, how's everything?"
"WOMAN: Everything's fine."
"SASHA: I love that. Give Riley a kiss. [to Jess] Then I came to my senses and ran for the hills but I got Lily so I win, ha ha. Short cut. Anyhow, I met Jimmy about five and a half years ago, but Lily's just crazy about him, so. . .[to man] . . . Ronnie, I found your keys again."
"RONNIE: Oh, good. Thank you, baby doll."
"SASHA: You have got to sew that hole in your pocket up, I mean it. Today, drop your coat by my house. I'll do it for you if you don't have the time. [to Jess] Got any brothers or sisters?"
"JESS: Apparently not."
"SASHA: Lily submitted a written request for a brother by the end of this year, but I think I should be married before we have any kids."
"JESS: You guys aren't married."
"SASHA: You didn't know that."
"JESS: No."
"SASHA: You guys had quite a talk, didn't you?"
"JESS: Yeah, well."
"SASHA: Okay, we're here."
"CUT TO HOT DOG STAND"
"[Jimmy and a worker are looking at a jar of pickles]"
"JIMMY: Well."
"LEE: It looks like a jar of pickles."
"JIMMY: I know it's a jar of pickles, but is it that jar of pickles?"
"LEE: Yes."
"JIMMY: You're sure."
"LEE: No."
"JIMMY: Look, the Chicago dills were the original pickles they sold here back in 1922."
"LEE: 1922. Yes, I listen."
"JIMMY: Now I finally tracked down the family that sold them, I paid a substantial premium to use the original labels, I waited weeks for them to arrive, and now they're here and I look at them and they don't look the same. Too many bumps."
"LEE: Jimmy, I'm begging you, play golf."
"JIMMY: Just call the guy and tell them they look different, please."
"LEE: Whatever you say."
"[Sasha and Jess walk up to the stand]"
"SASHA: Jimmy."
"JIMMY: Hey Sash."
"SASHA: You have a visitor."
"JIMMY: Yeah?"
"JESS: Hey."
"JIMMY: Hey. You, uh, just get here?"
"JESS: Just got here."
"SASHA: So, Jess, I assume you'll be staying for dinner?"
"JESS: Oh, well. . ."
"JIMMY: Yeah, sure, stay. You'll stay. He'll stay. We'll get Abbott's, right?"
"SASHA: Whatever you want. Well, I have to get back, so I will see you guys later. [leaves]"
"JESS: Sorry I didn't call."
"JIMMY: Hey, life's about the spontaneous, right?"
"JESS: This your place?"
"JIMMY: The Inferno. . .yes."
"JESS: It's nice."
"JIMMY: Thanks. Hey, why don't I come out there?"
"JESS: Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your work."
"JIMMY: No problem. Hey Lee, I'm gonna take a break for awhile."
"LEE: Thank God."
"[Jimmy walks out of the hot dog stand and over to Jess]"
"JESS: You didn't have to do that."
"JIMMY: It's fine. So, first time on the West Coast?"
"JESS: First time on the West Coast."
"JIMMY: Okay. The sites. Ocean."
"JESS: I wondered what that was."
"JIMMY: Sand."
"JESS: Keeps the ocean in its place."
"JIMMY: Sky."
"JESS: We've got one of those back east."
"JIMMY: And then you have the boardwalk. Sunglasses, smoothies, bootlegged CD's."
"JESS: Good ones?"
"JIMMY: Not bad, I guess. I never actually bought one. My neighbor Stan did. He's not my neighbor anymore. He used to work at Lockheed, but they shut down the Burbank plant, so he went to a trade school out in the valley. He installs cable now. Sends me a postcard at Christmas time. He's Dutch. Currently, we're in Santa Monica. You keep walking, you hit Venice - that's technically where we live. Past that, you got Marina Del Rey - lotta bike shots in that area. And then you're getting near the beaches - Manhattan, Redondo, and basically that's it."
"JESS: That's it. That's all of LA."
"JIMMY: Well, there are these crazy rumors that if you get in your car and you actually drive east away from the beach, there's some city and other stuff, but personally I don't believe it."
"JESS: I take it you like the beach."
"JIMMY: I would marry the beach if man and property were allowed to mate."
"JESS: Sounds serious."
"JIMMY: I've lived a lot of places all over this country, and nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to this."
"JESS: So where else have you lived?"
"JIMMY: What, where else? Let's see. Minneapolis, Chicago, Biloxi, Maine - worked on a lobster boat."
"JESS: Yeah?"
"JIMMY: Yeah. Let me tell you, I smelled great. Did a stint in New Jersey, New Hampshire..."
"JESS: New York?"
"JIMMY: Oh, yeah, well, obviously, New York. New York was. . .well, you know what New York was, so. . ."
"JESS: Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: Yeah?"
"JESS: I didn't come here to bust your balls, man."
"JIMMY: Okay, good to know."
"LEE: [calls from hot dog stand] Jimmy, I got the pickle guy. He's as worried about you as I am."
"JIMMY: I should take this."
"JESS: Go ahead. I can just hang out."
"JIMMY: You sure?"
"JESS: I got my book, I'm good."
"JIMMY: Okay, you're good."

"RORY: Hi, I'm here to see my grandmother."
"MAID: She's in the living room with Miss Celine."
"RORY: With who?"
"MAID: Right this way."
"[In the living room, there are clothes everywhere. Emily is wearing an evening gown and is checking herself in the mirror]"
"MISS CELINE: It's stunning."
"EMILY: Really?"
"MISS CELINE: Chills, I've got chills. Turn for me, dear. Oh, it moves, it just moves. Ginger Rogers always insisted her dresses move just like that."
"EMILY: Ginger Rogers, well."
"MISS CELINE: Of course, she didn't have your legs."
"EMILY: Oh, Celine."
"RORY: Hey, Grandma."
"EMILY: Rory, perfect. What do you think?"
"RORY: You look beautiful."
"EMILY: Well, if I do, it's all because of this lady here. Rory, I'd like you to meet Miss Celine. She's been our fashion consultant for years."
"RORY: Oh, well, how do you -"
"MISS CELINE: Oh my God, it's Audrey Hepburn."
"RORY: What?"
"MISS CELINE: You're Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina. Just a waif with eyes."
"RORY: Uh, thank you."
"RICHARD: Celine, I don't think the handkerchief works with this. Oh, Rory, I didn't know you were here."
"MISS CELINE: Richard, look at this girl, what do you see?"
"RICHARD: Well. . ."
"MISS CELINE: It's Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina."
"RICHARD: Hm, now that you mention it, there is a touch of Audrey in her."
"EMILY: But even prettier."
"MISS CELINE: Yes, without that ridiculous affected accent. For years I kept telling her, ""Audrey, get a speech therapist."" She was very stubborn. But could she wear capris."
"EMILY: You know, Rory is starting Yale in the fall."
"MISS CELINE: Yale, that is exciting. You'll need a whole new wardrobe, huh?"
"EMILY: Oh, Celine, I love this one."
"MISS CELINE: Yes, I had that exact suit made in mint for Mrs. Walter Cronkite just last week. A darling woman. We've been friends since the Big Bang."
"RORY: Uh, that's nice."
"EMILY: What do you think of this, Richard?"
"RICHARD: Well, I like the green one with the beads. It made you look like a mermaid."
"RORY: But you guys know that this is just a casual graduation. Folding chairs on the grass."
"MISS CELINE: There's going to be grass?"
"RORY: Well, yeah, it's going to be outside."
"MISS CELINE: Oh, you cannot wear green around grass. I learned that from Tova Borgnine the hard way. Go try the red one on. Red goes wonderful with nature."
"EMILY: All right."
"RICHARD: I'm gonna try the grey linen."
"MISS CELINE: Ah, yes, yes, with this white silk shirt."
"RICHARD: Oh, very nice."
"MISS CELINE: Yes, I had that exact shirt on Jimmy Stewart the night before his colonoscopy. He came through it clean as a whistle."
"RICHARD: Hm, hm."
"MISS CELINE: Never underestimate the power of a good shirt."
"RORY: I never will again."

"MADELINE: Next. Greg Agulara."
"LOUISE: Check."
"[Madeline rips a page out of another yearbook and hands the yearbook to him]"
"MADELINE: Next. Brad Langford."
"LOUISE: Check."
"[Madeline rips a page out of another yearbook and hands the yearbook to Brad]"
"BRAD: Why did you do that?"
"LOUISE: It has a really bad picture of us on it."
"BRAD: Yeah, but that page had the only picture of me in the entire book."
"MADELINE: Oh. [looks at the ripped-out page, then rips off a picture and hands it to him.] There. Next."
"[pan to Lorelai and Paris sitting at the Grad Night ticket table]"
"PARIS: No one is going to buy our tickets."
"LORELAI: Give it time, Paris."
"PARIS: We've been sitting here for an hour and have sold eight tickets."
"LORELAI: Grad Night is a big deal, Paris. They will buy the tickets."
"PARIS: Unbutton your top."
"LORELAI: What?"
"PARIS: Teenage boys are controlled by one thing. Unbutton your top."
"LORELAI: No."
"PARIS: Well, me doing it isn't going to help any."
"LORELAI: Paris, you need to relax. You need to stop worrying. You need to stop obsessing. You need to stop looking at my boobs."
"PARIS: Fine. Oh, man, even the stupid class poster table has a line."
"LORELAI: Okay, time to play ""Let's distract Paris."" Look at me. Let's talk."
"PARIS: About what?"
"LORELAI: Anything. Tell me what college you finally landed on."
"PARIS: I didn't."
"LORELAI: Well, what's it between?"
"PARIS: Princeton, Columbia, and Yale."
"LORELAI: Good choices."
"PARIS: I'm really not that interested in Columbia, but the thought of me going there horrifies my mother so I have to keep it in the mix, you know?"
"LORELAI: Do I ever."
"PARIS: Princeton's a good school, but Jamie goes there."
"LORELAI: That's your boyfriend?"
"PARIS: Yes. He goes there, and if I go there, it's going to look like I went there just to be with him. Suddenly I'm Felicity without the hair issues and I'm not terribly comfortable with that."
"LORELAI: But look at it like this - not going to a school you wanna go to just because your boyfriend is there is just as bad as going to a school you don't wanna go to just because your boyfriend isn't there."
"PARIS: I guess."
"LORELAI: If you wanna go to Princeton, go to Princeton. If you wanna go to Yale, go to Yale. Leave Jamie out of it. Leave your mother out of it. Just decide whatever it is you wanna do and do it."
"PARIS: I can try that, I guess. Thanks."
"LORELAI: You're welcome."
"[Lorelai leans forward to hug Paris]"
"PARIS: Uh, what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm giving you a hug."
"PARIS: Why?"

"JIMMY: Sash, I'm home!"
"[he walks to a cabinet to put his hat away. Lily is inside reading a book]"
"JIMMY: What's up, Lily-Lou? Want some pineapple on your pizza?"
"LILY: Yes."
"JIMMY: Yes. [closes the cabinet door]"
"JESS: Does she do that a lot?"
"JIMMY: All the time."
"JESS: You ever find it a little weird?"
"JIMMY: All the time. Uh, listen, why don't you give me a minute here."
"JESS: Okay."
"JIMMY: Make it two, two minutes. Three, and do a special knock before you come in, maybe a -"
"JESS: I'll tell you what, I passed a bookstore back on the boardwalk, why don't I just go check it out for awhile?"
"JIMMY: Okay. But I thought the knock idea was kind of cool."
"[Jess leaves. Jimmy walks into the kitchen where Sasha is sitting on the counter]"
"SASHA: So, last week when you said you were going to Sacramento to check out a potential supplier, you actually went. . ."
"JIMMY: To Connecticut to see Jess."
"SASHA: That was quite an elaborate story you made up."
"JIMMY: Well, I do have a gift."
"SASHA: Of course I didn't believe you."
"JIMMY: Okay, it's not a big gift, but . . ."
"SASHA: Why didn't you tell me?"
"JIMMY: I don't know. You're nodding your head. Why are you nodding your head? You're shrugging your shoulders. You're nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders. Why are you nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders? Will you stop nodding your head and shrugging your shoulders? Sasha, come on."
"SASHA: I'm gonna pick up the pizza."
"JIMMY: Just have it delivered."
"SASHA: The delivery guys are too stoned after six to find the house, it'll take forever."
"JIMMY: I didn't know how it was gonna go, okay? I didn't know if he was even gonna be there or if he was gonna wanna talk to me or slug me or -"
"SASHA: I get it."
"JIMMY: Sash."
"SASHA: I'll see you later, roomie."
"JIMMY: Do not do that. We are not roomies. We are partners, we're soul mates."
"SASHA: You just traveled cross-country to see your son for the first time since he was born and you didn't tell me. We are roomies."
"JIMMY: I'm sorry."
"SASHA: Get the extra mattress out of the closet."
"JIMMY: What for?"
"SASHA: For Jess."
"JIMMY: For Jess to do what?"
"SASHA: For Jess to sleep on."
"JIMMY: Jess is sleeping here?"
"SASHA: Isn't he?"
"JIMMY: I don't know."
"SASHA: Jimmy, you didn't ask him if he's staying the night?"
"JIMMY: No."
"SASHA: Well, did you ask him how long he's here for?"
"JIMMY: No."
"SASHA: Did you ask him anything?"
"JIMMY: Should I have?"
"SASHA: Jimmy, he could be in trouble."
"JIMMY: What, he's in trouble? What kind of trouble?"
"SASHA: How would I know what kind of trouble?"
"JIMMY: Well, you're the one that just said he was in trouble."
"SASHA: I said he could be in trouble. He could be running from the cops, or attempting to hop across America on one foot, or he really did come all the way from Connecticut just to have pizza with his father who he's not seen or heard from in seventeen years."
"JIMMY: What are the odds it's the last one?"
"SASHA: Do what you want. Talk to him, don't talk to him, I am not your mother. I don't care. I'll be back. Lily, come on."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Rory and Miss Celine are sitting in the living room]"
"MISS CELINE: Now, Sabrina, college is a very important time in a young girl's life. You need to be properly attired."
"RORY: I'm sure, but -"
"MISS CELINE: Trust me, a young girl is completely and solely judged by her appearance. All right, let's begin. I always start every wardrobe from the top. The hat. Remember Sabrina, it's the first thing that God sees when you walk outside in the morning."
"[Emily walks down the steps into the living room]"
"EMILY: Well, I'm exhausted. I feel as if I've tried on every dress in town."
"RORY: So is it the blue?"
"EMILY: Yes, I think it's the blue. I think it's quite suitable for my granddaughter's graduation."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey. Hi hon, hi Mom."
"RORY: Hey."
"EMILY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: I just came to pick Rory up. Miss Celine."
"MISS CELINE: Oh my God, it's Natalie Wood! Look Sabrina, it's Natalie Wood."
"LORELAI: Oh, Miss Celine, I can't believe it, you're still. . .uh, working."
"MISS CELINE: Oh, I tried to retire once. Olivia deHavilland wouldn't hear of it."
"LORELAI: Well, how are you? How's Mrs. Walter Cronkite."
"MISS CELINE: Lovely. Thank you for asking, Natalie."
"EMILY: I left the suits upstairs. I'll just go up and get them."
"MISS CELINE: No, no, I'll get them. It's who I am, the keeper of the clothes. Delight to see you again."
"LORELAI: Same here, Celine."
"[Celine goes upstairs]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, she was like a thousand when I was ten, I can't believe it."
"RORY: You should've seen all the clothes that Grandma tried on today."
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"RORY: She picked out a beautiful blue dress for graduation."
"LORELAI: Aw, I'd like to see that, Mom."
"EMILY: It needs to be altered."
"LORELAI: Oh, sure. I'll see it at graduation, I guess. So I'm sorry I didn't give you advanced notice that I was coming over."
"EMILY: I don't need advanced notice, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Okay, you just seem tense."
"EMILY: No, I'm just tired. And busy. I have a very busy evening ahead of me."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure you do."
"[the maid comes to the doorway]"
"MAID: Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: No, it's not."
"MAID: I just checked it and it's -"
"EMILY: I was in there ten minutes ago and it still had another forty minutes to go."
"MAID: But it's really brown and -"
"EMILY: Lupe, please do not argue with me. It's not ready. Now go in there and make the salad. What?"
"MAID: The salad's ready."
"EMILY: Lupe!"
"[the maid walks away]"
"LORELAI: Mom, it's seven o'clock."
"EMILY: So?"
"LORELAI: That's your dinnertime."
"EMILY: I don't have a dinnertime, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You don't have a dinnertime?"
"EMILY: No, I don't."
"LORELAI: So all the years I grew up in this house, we did not sit down to dinner at exactly seven o'clock every single night?"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: I just imagined that?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, I don't know what your obsession with dinnertime is."
"LORELAI: My obsession with dinnertime is that it was always at seven o'clock, now all of a sudden, it's not. Is it because I'm here?"
"EMILY: That's ridiculous."
"LORELAI: It is. I'm here, and if you served dinner, Miss Manners would insist that you invite me to stay and you don't want to, so you're going to pretend that dinner is suddenly whenever you feel like it."
"EMILY: Lorelai, do not get dramatic. Dinner is not ready, and even if it was, I would still not be able to invite you to stay because your father and I have plans tonight. We are eating quickly and then leaving."
"LORELAI: To go where?"
"EMILY: The Thompsons."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"EMILY: Book club."
"LORELAI: What book?"
"EMILY: Lovely Bones."
"LORELAI: Did you like it?"
"EMILY: It's not my taste but I respect the attempt."
"LORELAI: Now I know where I get it from."
"EMILY: We'll have dinner another time, all right?"
"LORELAI: Uh, so, are you kicking us out?"
"EMILY: I told you, we have plans."
"LORELAI: Or do you just wanna get that dinner of yours that's been ready for ten minutes now on the table?"
"EMILY: Lorelai, please."
"LORELAI: Tell me this - if I couldn't stay but Rory could, would you want her to?"
"EMILY: Of course I would, but as I told you, your father and I have plans."
"LORELAI: So she can't stay even if I'm gone?"
"EMILY: No, she can't."
"[Richard comes to the doorway]"
"RICHARD: Emily, for heaven's sake, it's 7:10. Why aren't we eating?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hi, Dad. Listen, um, Rory was gonna stay for dinner if you guys don't have plans."
"RICHARD: Of course we don't have any plans. Oh, I'm thrilled, Rory is staying. You just livened up a very boring night in the Gilmore house."
"LORELAI: Enjoy your dinner. And Mom, get yourself an agent 'cause you're wasting that talent of yours in dinner theater."
"RORY: Mom, wait."
"[Lorelai walks outside and Rory follows her]"
"RORY: Mom, wait. Where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I'm gonna drive in a circle backwards really fast to reverse the Earth's orbit to go back in time to before I made the insane decision to come here in the first place."
"RORY: You came here to pick me up."
"LORELAI: What was I thinking doing that?"
"RORY: You were thinking, 'Hey, wouldn't it be great for my daughter not to have to walk all the way back to Stars Hollow.'"
"LORELAI: Well, a thirty-mile hike never hurt anyone. God, I can't believe her."
"RORY: And I can't believe you."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: You were gonna leave me here?"
"LORELAI: So you could have dinner with them."
"RORY: I never said I wanted to have dinner with them. You said I wanted to have dinner with them, and then you stormed out."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm sorry. I just, I finally realized that I can't do this anymore. I can't come back here anymore, I'm done."
"RORY: Well, I'm sorry. I never should've asked you to pick me up."
"LORELAI: It's okay. It's good, actually. Now I can stop feeling guilty for not talking to them. I can go back to the way things were before. We share a nose and that's it."
"RORY: So we're going?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we're going."
"RORY: Okay, I have to go get my books. Please be here when I come back."
"[Rory walks back inside]"
"EMILY: Are you staying?"
"RORY: No, I have to go, Grandma."
"EMILY: All right, I guess we'll just see you at graduation then."
"RORY: I guess you will."
"EMILY: I swear, I don't know what to do with that mother of yours, I really don't. Everything has to be such a scene."
"RORY: I think you're being really stupid. [leaves]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai and Rory drive through the town square]"
"LORELAI: So, Souplantation. . ."
"RORY: Hang on, I'm almost at the end of this chapter. [pause] Okay, let the raving begin."
"LORELAI: A room full of all you can eat food. Soup, salad, pizza, pasta, chicken wings, ice cream, rainbow sprinkles. How did I not know about the rainbow sprinkles?"
"RORY: I have no good answers for you."
"LORELAI: We are going back with Tupperware."
"RORY: It's turning yellow."
"LORELAI: Ah, sh**t."
"RORY: Come on, g*n it."
"LORELAI: I can't."
"RORY: Mom, we have to get home."
"LORELAI: Rory, I already have two tickets. I cannot get another."
"[Lorelai stops the car at the red light]"
"RORY: Oh, I can't believe you stopped."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you wanted me to go."
"RORY: There's no one around."
"LORELAI: Now no one's around, but the second I run that light, a police car, four helicopters, the Canadian mounties and the crew of Cops jump out of a dumpster and I'm toast."
"RORY: Paranoid."
"LORELAI: Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, my friend."
"RORY: All right, I guess we wait."
"[They see Luke sweeping the sidewalk in front of the diner]"
"RORY: Do you think Luke will know we went to Souplantation?"
"LORELAI: Not unless you tell him."
"RORY: But maybe he'll be able to tell. They'll be a glow."
"LORELAI: An all-you-can-eat glow."
"RORY: He'll see the glow, he'll know we cheated, and he'll never give us extra fries again."
"[Luke sees them and runs inside]"
"RORY: Um, Mom, why did just bolt away from us?"
"LORELAI: Maybe he saw the glow."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Okay, first of all, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. I just thought with all the stuff you were doing, maybe I should wait."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LORELAI: Jess is gone."
"RORY: Gone where?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Luke knows, but he didn't tell me. But he doesn't seem to think he's coming back."
"RORY: Neither do I."
"LORELAI: Are you okay?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Ugh, forget this."
"[Lorelai runs the red light and heads home. A police motorcycle pulls out and follows after her]"
"CUT TO CALIFORNIA"
"[Jess is browsing in a bookstore when Jimmy walks up to him]"
"JIMMY: Hey, when you say 'I'm going to check out a bookstore on the boardwalk', you be more specific."
"JESS: What?"
"JIMMY: I have been wandering around for over an hour. I've been to three different bookstores. I have been worried sick about you, you hear me?"
"JESS: Sorry."
"JIMMY: Outside."
"JESS: But -"
"JIMMY: Outside."
"[they walk outside]"
"JIMMY: Are you in trouble?"
"JESS: What?"
"JIMMY: You know, when you left home, were the cops after you?"
"JESS: No."
"JIMMY: No 'cause they shouldn't be or no 'cause they haven't found the head yet?"
"JESS: What's up, Jimmy?"
"JIMMY: You just showed up here, man."
"JESS: I know I did."
"JIMMY: No call, no letter, just like -"
"JESS: Just like you showed up in Stars Hollow with no letter, no call."
"JIMMY: Hey."
"JESS: Were you in trouble?"
"JIMMY: We're not talking about me, we're talking about you."
"JESS: I'm not running from the cops."
"JIMMY: Then why are you here?"
"JESS: Why'd you come to Stars Hollow?"
"JIMMY: Hey, listen, Mr. Double-Talk, I need an answer here."
"JESS: Well, so do I. You show up, you don't talk to me, you don't say anything. You just have a cup of coffee, then you left. Why'd you come if you didn't even wanna talk to me?"
"JIMMY: I did wanna talk to you."
"JESS: You did?"
"JIMMY: Of course I wanted to talk to you. You think a person travels all the way across the country just to listen to a Bowie song? Granted, a classic off Ziggy, but still."
"JESS: So, what, you're telling me you just chickened out?"
"JIMMY: Yeah."
"JESS: Oh. Well, I came to see you."
"JIMMY: Okay."
"JESS: And I thought maybe I could crash here for a little while."
"JIMMY: Uh huh."
"JESS: Just a little while. I don't need my own room or anything. I can just sleep on the couch."
"JIMMY: Or the extra mattress we keep in the closet."
"JESS: Sure, that'd be fine, too."
"JIMMY: You know, Sasha's always right. It drives me crazy. No matter what the situation, she's always right."
"JESS: Jimmy."
"JIMMY: I'd love to be right just once in awhile, you know?"
"JESS: It wouldn't be for long."
"JIMMY: Do you know she called the Super Bowl five times in a row? Who does that? What is she, a witch?"
"JESS: You know what, say no if you want."
"JIMMY: Jess, man, come on, you can't stay here."
"JESS: Why not?"
"JIMMY: 'Cause you can't."
"JESS: Why not?"
"JIMMY: 'Cause you can't."
"JESS: Why not?"
"JIMMY: Because you can't."
"JESS: Well, I'd ask ""why not"" but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere."
"JIMMY: Look at me, Jess. I'm not a father. I was never a father. I left you because I wasn't a father. I mean it, the minute the cigar was finished, I was like, ""What the hell are you doing? You can't take care of yourself. How are you gonna take care of someone else?"""
"JESS: That's not why -"
"JIMMY: I can't take you in, I can't raise you."
"JESS: Raise me? I'm eighteen! I'm raised. I can vote, I can be drafted. It's a little late to throw me a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle birthday party."
"JIMMY: I thought you didn't come here to bust my balls."
"JESS: I didn't."
"JIMMY: Well, then put the bat down, man."
"JESS: I don't need a daddy. I just need a place to crash."
"JIMMY: Do you even understand that it's only been the last five years that I've even started to put my life together? You don't wanna be around me. I am a screw-up. That is my genetic code."
"JESS: Well, the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree."
"JIMMY: Don't say that. You're young, you can do anything you want."
"JESS: A month. Just let me stay a month."
"JIMMY: Are you listening? I have nothing to offer you. Nothing."
"JESS: You have nothing? I have nothing! I have no place to go. I can't stay at Luke's, I can't stay in Stars Hollow. My mother is a wackjob. I mean, you're saying you're this loser and what, you don't wanna take me off this terrific path I'm headed down right now? I'm not graduating high school. I don't know what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life, but something's telling me I better find out soon or I'm gonna be that guy out there on the boardwalk selling the hemp hats."
"JIMMY: I have one of those. It's a good hat."
"JESS: Well?"
"JIMMY: I have to talk it over with Sasha."
"JESS: Just tell her I'm a dog."
"JIMMY: Great idea. Maybe you can sit there and lick yourself while she decides, you know, help sell it."
"JESS: Thank you, Jimmy."
"JIMMY: If she says it's okay, then we'll see."
"JESS: Fine, we'll see."
"JIMMY: It may not work out."
"JESS: I totally understand."
"JIMMY: But I'll ask and if she says it's okay, then we'll see. We'll see."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door]"
"RORY: Oh my God, I'm so tired."
"LORELAI: Here's a crazy thought, how about going to bed?"
"RORY: I have to study."
"LORELAI: Or, better yet, make a pot of coffee and once again, get no sleep. Just as good."
"RORY: What's this?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's just. . .Yale needed my Social Security number for something."
"RORY: Oh."
"[Rory walks toward the kitchen. Lorelai looks through Rory's yearbook in the living room]"
"LORELAI: Look who became a soche."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You have a lot of signatures in here, little girl."
"RORY: Everybody signs everybody's yearbook. It's polite."
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Rory, have a great summer. BFF. Amber."" Hey, Amber BFF'ed you."
"RORY: Yeah, I feel truly blessed."
"LORELAI: [reads] ""Hey, Aurory Borealis."" Okay, can't talk to this one ever again. [reads] ""You have been my inspiration, my rock, my light. I loved you in South Pacific."" When did you do South Pacific?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Some dipstick named Shauna thinks you were in South Pacific."
"RORY: Oh, Shauna tends to get people mixed up."
"LORELAI: Oh, okay."
"[Lorelai looks at the yearbook some more, then walks to the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you know what's weird? A lot of the kids in here are calling you a valedictorian. Is that anything like a dirty skank, 'cause if it is I'll kick their plaid butts up and down the sidewalk. Were you named valedictorian?"
"RORY: Yes, and you know what that means? One more stupid speech that I have to write, that I have no time to write, but nevertheless, I have to write."
"LORELAI: Hey, listen, my little Holly Hunter in Broadcast News, I'm gonna let you freak out and study like a mad woman and stress yourself out until finals, but once they're over, we are gonna celebrate big time. . .'cause this is amazing."
"RORY: Yeah, it is."
"LORELAI: Okay, now go make Mommy nervous."

"OPEN IN TOWN SQUARE"
"[The troubadour starts playing a song. Lorelai and Rory push past him with large backpacks on their backs]"
"RORY: Coming through! Heavy packs."
"LORELAI: Out of our way, peace boy! No offense, love the song. Carry on. Go."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk into Luke's Diner]"
"LORELAI: Ugh. And wuss patrol, halt."
"[they drop their backpacks on the floor]"
"RORY: I've never known such pain."
"LORELAI: We are so not walking around Europe with those annoying things on our backs."
"RORY: But we're backpacking through Europe. How're we gonna do this without backpacks?"
"LORELAI: But all the time we've talked about backpacking, I never actually pictured us with backpacks."
"RORY: Well, what were you picturing?"
"LORELAI: Spry, accommodating European men with neat mustaches trailing after us, carrying our luggage, hailing taxi cabs, constantly reminding us how beautiful we are."
"RORY: No, it's just the two of us humping our backpacks around."
"LORELAI: Well, at least my new walking shoes are all broken in. If you count broken skin, broken toes."
"[Luke walks over]"
"LUKE: Don't do that."
"LORELAI: Don't do what?"
"LUKE: Don't take your shoes off. This is a restaurant."
"LORELAI: I don't see a ""No shirt, no shoes, no service"" sign."
"LUKE: It's right here, don't do that."
"RORY: We're in pain, Luke."
"LUKE: But it's great that you guys are bearing it so nobly. And can you move these?"
"RORY: Can? No."
"LORELAI: Would if we could? Debatable."
"[Luke moves the backpacks out of the way]"
"LORELAI: Look at that."
"RORY: Spry and accommodating."
"LORELAI: Hey, would you grow a mustache and follow us around Europe?"
"LUKE: Sorry, got travel plans of my own."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Yup, I'm closing down the diner for a couple of weeks and taking Nicole on a little trip."
"RORY: Fun."
"LUKE: We're driving through Western Canada and then taking a cruise up to Alaska."
"RORY: A cruise?"
"LORELAI: Intimate."
"LUKE: I guess. Is it?"
"LORELAI: [sings] The Love Boat."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: A cruise is a good spot to get down on one knee."
"LUKE: And do my ventriloquist act?"
"LORELAI: And propose."
"LUKE: I have no plans to propose."
"LORELAI: You don't now, but after you've had dinner at Captain Stubing's table and Isaac's served you up a couple of mojitos."
"RORY: Romantic cruises say commitment, my friend."
"LUKE: I am not committing and I am not proposing, so drop it."
"LORELAI: Okay, it's dropped."
"LUKE: Really drop it."
"LORELAI: Did I not just say it's dropped?"
"RORY: Heard it with my own ears."
"LUKE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: [sings] The Love Boat."
"[Luke gives her a look]"
"LORELAI: If you'd get a radio in here, I wouldn't have to do that."
"LUKE: Okay, so your graduation is Wednesday at four, correct?"
"RORY: You know, you really don't have to go to it, Luke."
"LUKE: I want to. I feel like I've been through this whole Chilton thing with you."
"RORY: Okay, good, I want you there."
"LUKE: Good. So what do you want?"
"LORELAI: Are you hungry?"
"RORY: I'm just sore."
"LORELAI: Let's go home and rest."
"[they get up and start to leave]"
"LUKE: Hey, wait, don't leave these."
"RORY: Store 'em for us."
"LORELAI: Yeah, until we hire a flatbed truck to carry 'em home for us."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Ugh, my left foot hurts. My right foot hurts. Carry me."
"RORY: You carry me."
"LORELAI: You carry me."
"RORY: No, you carry me."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO THE DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Lorelai and Sookie are standing in the front yard]"
"SOOKIE: What is taking him so long?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Luke, come on!"
"[Luke walks out of the inn]"
"LUKE: Oh, geez, I walked right into a cobweb."
"LORELAI: Aw, aw. So, uh, what's the shape of the place?"
"LUKE: It was a really big cobweb."
"SOOKIE: Terrible. So what's the story?"
"LUKE: Is there a spider on me?"
"LORELAI: Suck it up, big guy, and tell us the scoop."
"LUKE: It's not so bad."
"SOOKIE: So it's not so good."
"LORELAI: Not so bad is not so good."
"LUKE: No, really, it's not bad. The floors -"
"SOOKIE: Are rotted!"
"LORELAI: I knew it. They need to be replaced."
"SOOKIE: It's a disaster."
"LUKE: The floors are fine. They need refinishing, but they're really nice quartersawn oak floors."
"LORELAI: What about the roof?"
"LUKE: The roof -"
"LORELAI: Is sh*t?"
"SOOKIE: It's caving in."
"LORELAI: The walls, too?"
"SOOKIE: Along with our hopes and dreams."
"LUKE: No, the roof is fine. Some shingles need replacing, but that looks like the extent of it."
"[Kirk leans out of an upper-story window]"
"KIRK: Almost done here, folks."
"LORELAI: Great, Kirk. You find any mold?"
"KIRK: You mean, did I find any silent death? Not so far, no."
"LORELAI: Good."
"KIRK: I did tell you about the dangers of mold, right? And Ed McMahon's dog?"
"LORELAI: Yes, you did."
"KIRK: Suffered memory loss due to mold infestation. Forgot how to sit."
"LORELAI: Yes, it was horrible."
"KIRK: It's a growth industry right now, pardon the pun. Mold is money. I just wish I wasn't so scared of finding it."
"LORELAI: Well, don't look too hard then."
"KIRK: Thanks."
"LORELAI: So, what's the final prognosis, Luke? We're not buying a money pit, are we?"
"LUKE: You're gonna spend money, but it's not a pit. Might be a steal."
"LORELAI: It's a steal!"
"SOOKIE: We are such great businesswomen."
"LUKE: Once you start work, you can probably have this place up and running in four or five months."
"SOOKIE: Which will give the Independence Inn owners plenty of time to find our replacements."
"LORELAI: We could be running our own inn in less than a year."
"[Kirk runs out of the inn]"
"KIRK: Oh, ohhh!"
"LORELAI: What's the matter Kirk? Mold?"
"KIRK: No, mouse!"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Students are in line to record messages for the video yearbook]"
"STUDENT: We all knew that our education at Chilton would be exemplary, but it was the people at Chilton. All my friends - Hi Marcy, love you. Cody and Debbie, love you, too. The faculty, the administrative staff. Even our janitorial staff - Jaime and Joachim. I can't count the number of times you guys made me laugh. . ."
"[cut to Rory and Paris in line]"
"PARIS: Does she need medical attention?"
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: Jaime and Joachim aren't even getting a copy of this. She's maroon."
"RORY: It's the end of the year, people get nostalgic."
"PARIS: So, how's your valedictorian speech coming along?"
"RORY: Oh, um, it's okay. Pretty standard. Boring. 'We love the school, blah blah blah.' No one listens to those things anyhow, so -"
"PARIS: Relax, I'm okay with you making valedictorian over me."
"RORY: Oh, good, thanks."
"PARIS: Sure. I actually googled the personal histories of Ivy League valedictorians going back twenty-five years, and found some enlightening statistics. They don't necessarily do too well in later life, did you know that?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Oh, yeah. A lot of business failures, crumbled marriages, suicides, obesity."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: A bunch died in car crashes, several did time, one suffocated when his cat fell asleep on his face."
"RORY: Okay, well, thanks again."
"[Louise and Madeline take their turn in front of the camera]"
"LOUISE: Okay, A/V geek, just pan my body nice and slow."
"A/V GEEK: Why?"
"MADELINE: Yeah, why?"
"LOUISE: Because I'll never look better than I do now."
"PARIS: Come on ladies, we don't have all day. A/V geek, I'm going to need six minutes."
"A/V GEEK: You're only allowed two."
"PARIS: Rolling!"
"A/V GEEK: Rolling."
"PARIS: Fellow Chilton seniors, it's been quite a year. . ."
"CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN"
"[Sookie and Michel are at the front desk.]"
"MICHEL: I hate this."
"SOOKIE: One guest. In the whole inn, one guy."
"MICHEL: And I pulled towel duty today. It's especially awful handling guest towels when you know exactly which guests the towels belong to. It's his mites on those towels."
"SOOKIE: Don't be gross."
"MICHEL: This is degrading for a man of my capabilities."
"SOOKIE: Well, what about me? I've got no kitchen. I'm a chef. My k*ll are deteriorating. I need to sauté, emulsify, marinate."
"MICHEL: I need more mental stimulation."
"SOOKIE: I need to frickin' fry a dead animal in a k*ll. I'm going nuts."
"MICHEL: I should've been a dancer."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"MICHEL: My mother put me in dance school and I rebelled, I wanted to kick the football. I should not have."
"SOOKIE: I've seen you dance and you jump around like a duck."
"MICHEL: You know, I'm getting mighty sick of you."
"SOOKIE: Not as sick as I am of you."
"MICHEL: You know what, you do his towels. I'm not doing his towels anymore."
"SOOKIE: I'm not doing his stupid towels. I hate that stupid guy with his stupid newspaper. He's stupid."
"[Lorelai walks over]"
"LORELAI: Yo, guys, no bickering in front of the guest."
"SOOKIE: Tell it to Deney Terrio here. I should've been a dancer."
"MICHEL: Lorelai, how long can we keep this up?"
"LORELAI: Keep what up?"
"MICHEL: We have one guest, half the rooms are still closed from the fire, most of the staff is laid off, I am doing mite towels, and the owner's son is walking around with a bunch of men in suits."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, John's here. That can't be good."
"LORELAI: John is here looking things over for the renovation that will reopen all the closed rooms so we can be up and running again. Stop worrying."
"MICHEL: Okay."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"[Michel and Sookie walk away. The phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking."
"EMILY: Lorelai, it's your mother."
"LORELAI: Mother, hi."
"EMILY: I'm calling to find out how it's going to work at Rory's graduation. Are we going to be sitting together?"
"LORELAI: Well, hm, hm, hm."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Sorry. Hmm."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Mom, of course we'll be sitting together. We're family."
"EMILY: Well, I knew that. I just wasn't sure if you did."
"LORELAI: Well, we're sitting together."
"EMILY: Good."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"RICHARD: Ask her about the gift, Emily."
"LORELAI: Dad?"
"EMILY: He's on the other line."
"LORELAI: Oh, sure got the quiet thing down there."
"RICHARD: I'm on the upstairs portable, but I'm on my way downstairs. I see your mother now. Hello Emily."
"EMILY: Hello Richard."
"RICHARD: I'm on my way to the couch and am about to sit."
"LORELAI: It's like the thrilling day of radio here."
"EMILY: We wanted to ask you about a gift for Rory."
"RICHARD: It's a big gift, a little extravagant."
"EMILY: But it's a big occasion, so it makes sense."
"RICHARD: We wanna buy her a car."
"LORELAI: Well, I think that's a great idea."
"EMILY: Really?"
"RICHARD: Wonderful."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Rory needs to get back and forth from Yale a lot, and the quicker she can do it, the more I get to see her, so it's really kind of a present for me, too."
"RICHARD: Yes, right."
"EMILY: I suppose so."
"RICHARD: Didn't think of that."
"LORELAI: Just not a gas guzzler. And no Ferrari's or Lamborghini's."
"RICHARD: So nothing Italian?"
"LORELAI: No, it can be Italian, just sensible Italian."
"RICHARD: All right, well, good."
"EMILY: I'm glad we had this settled."
"LORELAI: Good. Well, maybe I'll see you at the graduation, maybe I won't."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: See you there. Bye."
"RICHARD: Goodbye."
"EMILY: Bye."
"[they hang up. A man walks over to the front desk]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you and your Armani posse want something to drink, John?"
"JOHN: No, no, Lorelai. We're fine, thanks."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, I've been lying to people about you all day."
"JOHN: About what?"
"LORELAI: Oh, about how it's not a big deal that you're walking around with a concerned look on your face with a group of men with concerned looks on their faces. I think I've been lying to me a little, too."
"JOHN: We have to close off three more rooms."
"LORELAI: Three rooms? That'll leave us with two."
"JOHN: And, uh, the estimate for the repairs to get everything back to the quality we had and up to code. . .it's not pretty."
"LORELAI: No, that's not pretty."
"JOHN: Mom's leaning toward selling."
"LORELAI: Selling."
"JOHN: Nothing's final yet."
"LORELAI: Yeah, nothing's final. I just. . .Rory grew up here. I grew up here."
"JOHN: Yeah, I better get back to my group."
"LORELAI: Right, sure, you go. Hey, be careful not to trip over our guest."
"JOHN: I won't."
"CUT TO SOOKIE'S HOUSE"
"[Sookie and Jackson are watching television. There's a knock at the front door.]"
"LORELAI: [calls from outside] Sookie, Jackson, you better not be in bed."
"JACKSON: Are you expecting Lorelai?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: [calls] Come on. The night is young and the champagne's cold."
"SOOKIE: The champagne?"
"[they answer the door]"
"LORELAI: Surprise!"
"SOOKIE: What is this?"
"LORELAI: It's a celebration."
"SOOKIE: For what?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, get some glasses, and Jackson, put some music on. Whatever you want, just make it festive."
"JACKSON: Got it."
"SOOKIE: I don't know what this is, but it's fun."
"JACKSON: Let's see. I've got Creedence Clearwater Revival."
"LORELAI: Good energy, too hillbilly."
"JACKSON: Okay."
"LORELAI: How you coming with those glasses, Sook?"
"SOOKIE: Just wiping off the fancy ones."
"JACKSON: Huey Lewis and the News? It's Sookie's."
"SOOKIE: Hey, we all have our guilty pleasures."
"JACKSON: Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass?"
"LORELAI: Ah, fun, festive, that's perfect! Crank it. Okay, I've got some cold Dom for me and Jackson."
"JACKSON: Happens to be my brand."
"SOOKIE: Oh, I love this song."
"LORELAI: And, uh, for Sookie and little baby, uh, whatever-it-is, we've got the, uh, apple bubbly stuff. And cheers."
"JACKSON/SOOKIE: Cheers!"
"SOOKIE: Well, come on, what are we celebrating?"
"LORELAI: Well, you ready?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"JACKSON: Definitely!"
"LORELAI: The Independence Inn is closing."
"JACKSON: Yay!"
"SOOKIE: Yay! The inn is closing."
"LORELAI: Not closing, closed. We're finished. It's all over. They're boarding the place up as we speak. Who wants more?"
"JACKSON: Well, did they find some gold in the basement or something 'cause I'm missing the celebrating angle."
"LORELAI: You should always celebrate new challenges, and that's what this is."
"SOOKIE: A new challenge."
"LORELAI: Yes. They'll be some severance pay, then nothing."
"SOOKIE: Nothing!"
"LORELAI: Nothing but exciting new challenges. Cheers!"
"SOOKIE: The inn is closed."
"JACKSON: Well, I guess this means that you guys can focus solely on refurbishing the Dragonfly, getting that up and running. That's exciting."
"SOOKIE: Yes, it is."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I agree. But just drink some more. How're you feeling?"
"SOOKIE: A little drunk, and all I'm drinking is apple juice."
"LORELAI: Well, good, 'cause I've got another little piece of news for you. We can't buy the Dragonfly because I can't swing my share of the money because I no longer have a steady income."
"JACKSON: Wow, that is great."
"SOOKIE: I'm sorry, was that an exciting challenge too?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely. Yesterday our lives were boring and predictable. We had jobs, we were gonna start our own business. But now everything is wide open. We can do anything we want because we're not penned in. That's good."
"SOOKIE: Yes, that's good. And thinking of those new challenges is a nice way to distract me from the fact that we don't work together anymore so we're gonna see way less of each other."
"LORELAI: Which will make our limited time together more enjoyable."
"JACKSON: Right. And since I'm your vegetable supplier, I'm losing work, and seeing my wife and close friend way less than before."
"LORELAI: Cheers!"
"CUT TO TOWN MEETING"
"[Taylor is at the podium in front of a bored-looking group of townspeople]"
"TAYLOR: That would convert it into a town bylaw, a minor but nonetheless important change from local ordinance, giving us the leeway to enforce charter amendments five and six and grandfathering in previously proposed statutes with no procedural delay. So all those in favor of going ahead of this, say aye."
"[silence]"
"TAYLOR: All those opposed?"
"[silence]"
"TAYLOR: People, what's going on? People!"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, sorry, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: What is the matter with you?"
"LUKE: I think it might be the first time sixty people lost their train of thought all at the same time."
"BABETTE: Yeah, Taylor, your voice always makes me think of my grocery list. We need croutons."
"MOREY: Got it."
"TAYLOR: Moving on. Now, people, I know it's an unpleasant subject, but the deer population in this town is reaching monstrous proportions."
"GYPSY: Not this again."
"MISS PATTY: He's always going on about the deer."
"LUKE: Leave 'em alone, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: But they're taking over the town. We need to institute partial elimination."
"MOREY: Partial elimination?"
"GYPSY: You wanna k*ll the little romping Bambi's?"
"TAYLOR: People, do I have to detail the problems that these deer cause?"
"LUKE: No, but you will."
"TAYLOR: Lyme disease, auto accidents, plane accidents."
"LUKE: We have flying deer?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, that's scary."
"BABETTE: Yeah. Those ones you can snuff."
"TAYLOR: But the worst problem is the crop loss. Dean, hand me the blow-up please."
"GYPSY: Hey, Dean, he's paying you for all this, right?"
"DEAN: Yeah."
"KIRK: Really, how much?"
"TAYLOR: People, this is a randomly chosen but typical landscaped area in the town that was denuded by these ruminant pests."
"GYPSY: Randomly chosen?"
"LUKE: Taylor, that's your backyard."
"MISS PATTY: This is a little self-serving."
"TAYLOR: It might be my yard. Uh. . ."
"BABETTE: Might be? Taylor, no one else has a ""Kiss the Gardener"" sign."
"MOREY: This is a trumped up problem."
"TAYLOR: So none of you are interested in addressing this scourge?"
"KIRK: I have a thought."
"TAYLOR: Go ahead, Kirk."
"KIRK: A controlled hunt."
"BABETTE: g*n?"
"KIRK: Not g*n, wolves."
"LUKE: What?"
"KIRK: You release a pack of wolves, they eat the deer, problem solved. Of course, then you'll have to deal with your wolf problem."
"MISS PATTY: I say that we defer this unsavory topic for another year."
"TAYLOR: Now wait a minute."
"MISS PATTY: All those in favor?"
"EVERYONE: Aye!"
"MISS PATTY: Taylor's opposed. Meeting adjourned."
"[People get up to leave. Rory walks in the back door]"
"RORY: I missed the whole thing?"
"LANE: Yes, and I'm still semi-grounded, so I only have a limited amount of time in the outside world."
"RORY: Well, hurry and show me your prom pictures."
"LANE: [picks up a large bag] These are them."
"RORY: Lane, how many did you take?"
"LANE: Three hundred. I'll leave them with you, they're pretty self explanatory."
"RORY: What's this?"
"LANE: Our chicken piccata."
"RORY: Ah, and this?"
"LANE: Our chicken piccata after one bite."
"RORY: So, don't tell me, two bites?"
"LANE: Yup."
"RORY: Okay, I think I can follow this."
"LANE: Gotta run. Keep 'em in order."
"RORY: I will."
"[Lane leaves. Rory walks over to Dean, who is cleaning up at the front of the room]"
"RORY: Hi."
"DEAN: Hi."
"RORY: Taylor's paying you to do all this work, isn't he?"
"DEAN: He knows I need money, so he's helping me out with extra stuff to do. He's a good guy."
"RORY: Yeah, he is a good guy. A very good guy. So how are the old wedding plans?"
"DEAN: They're fine."
"RORY: You know, my mom's held about a million weddings at the inn and I've worked on a lot of them, so I'm a fountain of useful tips."
"DEAN: Good."
"RORY: For instance, your photographer, have him take candid photographs along with the other ones, so that way you'll capture a lot of your favorite moments and you won't be stuck with just the stiff, you know, posed shots."
"DEAN: Candid, okay."
"RORY: And if the ring bearer is younger than five years-old."
"DEAN: My nephew, he's three."
"RORY: Don't give him the ring until the last second because I have seen many a ring swallowed, and well, it takes a couple days to get it back."
"DEAN: Good point. It's actually been kind of overwhelming. I mean, you have to rent the hall like a year in advance."
"RORY: And make sure that your deposit is refundable as long as you can."
"DEAN: Yeah, it is. And then there's a lot of stuff that we have to buy, too, for our place."
"RORY: Oh yeah, about that. Come on, sit."
"[they sit down and Rory hands him a shopping catalog]"
"DEAN: What's this?"
"RORY: Your wedding gift."
"DEAN: What?"
"RORY: You can get anything you want, but I've marked a bunch of pages with stuff that I think would be most appropriate, and I just wanted to get in early so I'd be the first one to get you a blender, not the third one."
"DEAN: You don't have to do this."
"RORY: I know. That's why it's fun."
"DEAN: This has everything."
"RORY: I'd recommend the mixing bowls, those are really nice. Or a knife set and a sharpener. Sharpening's very important. I learned that from Sookie. If you leave 'em too long, it's too late. Respect your knives."
"DEAN: Thanks, Rory."
"RORY: You're welcome. So just look through it with Lindsay and pick out what you want and I'll order it."
"DEAN: I will."
"RORY: Bye, Dean."
"DEAN: Bye, Rory."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S LIVING ROOM"
"[Rory is trying on her graduation dress for Sookie and Lorelai]"
"SOOKIE: Maybe we should bring it in a bit more."
"RORY: Oh sure, but first we'll have to use a medieval torture instrument to crush my ribs and flatten my spinal cord in order to accommodate your sadistic wish there."
"LORELAI: Don't use subtlety on us. We're slow."
"SOOKIE: I think she's saying that we don't need to bring it in anymore."
"LORELAI: Take it off, you're done."
"SOOKIE: Ugh, I should go. I've got a stupid job interview tomorrow morning, and you know what, I'm nervous."
"LORELAI: Which place?"
"SOOKIE: Harrington's in Woodbridge."
"LORELAI: Nice."
"SOOKIE: They want me to be their executive chef four nights a week. God, I can't imagine working someplace else. And without my Lorelai!"
"RORY: But it's only a few months until the Dragonfly opens, right?"
"SOOKIE: Uh. . .you haven't told her yet."
"RORY: Told me what?"
"LORELAI: I was waiting for an opportunity."
"RORY: To tell me what?"
"LORELAI: Which apparently is right now. Okay, um, hon, listen. We, um. . .we're not buying the Dragonfly."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: It's just not the right time."
"RORY: You're crazy. It's the perfect time."
"LORELAI: Not really."
"RORY: But if you wait, someone else is gonna buy it. You said so yourself."
"SOOKIE: I'm gonna go, guys. Sorry to spill the beans."
"LORELAI: That's okay. I'll see you later."
"[Sookie leaves]"
"RORY: Mom, why put it off? I mean, I know the Independence Inn closing is a setback."
"LORELAI: Big one."
"RORY: But we've got the rest of Grandpa's money, that's plenty to buy the Dragonfly Inn, and we'll just scrimp on everything until it's all up and running and successful."
"LORELAI: It would take a lot of scrimping."
"RORY: Well, I'm a master scrimper. I would make the Olympic scrimping team. I'm that good, boy."
"LORELAI: Honey, we didn't get financial aid for Yale."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: No scholarships, no hardship money, no money-off coupons, no gift certificates, nothing."
"RORY: I don't understand, what happened?"
"LORELAI: Well, irony of ironies, the money I got from your grandpa took us out of the running for financial aid 'cause it made it look like we have money."
"RORY: Well, send them proof - a bank statement, a letter from Grandpa. Here, take a picture of this couch - no one will think we have money after looking at this couch."
"LORELAI: I tried everything, I swear."
"RORY: Why didn't you tell me this?"
"LORELAI: With everything that's going on, finals and all your personal stuff, I didn't want you worrying."
"RORY: But Grandpa's money -"
"LORELAI: Is paying for Yale."
"RORY: No! No way!"
"LORELAI: Rory."
"RORY: I'll take a student loan out from the bank. That's what banks are for."
"LORELAI: Honey, I don't want you to be buried by loans the day you graduate from college."
"RORY: Well, then I'll major in something that'll immediately make me a lot of money when I graduate. I'll major in business or engineering."
"LORELAI: You are not changing your major from journalism because of my lack of money."
"RORY: It's our lack."
"LORELAI: Look, if you need to work as a low-paid intern for a magazine or a stringer for some small-town newspaper or Tom Brokaw's toupee comber-outer before you make real money, then that's what you'll do."
"RORY: There has to be another way."
"LORELAI: I've looked. There's nothing."
"RORY: This is so not fair to you."
"LORELAI: I'll have my own inn one day, I promise. But Yale comes first."
"[Rory starts walking to her bedroom]"
"LORELAI: What are you gonna do now?"
"RORY: Rail at God for awhile."
"LORELAI: Tell her I said hi."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is in the living room, which is cluttered with clothes and other stuff to pack for their trip]"
"LORELAI: Hey, what happened to our packing elves who were gonna pack our packs over night?"
"[Rory walks into the room holding a black sweater]"
"RORY: How about this?"
"LORELAI: You hate the dress I made you that much?"
"RORY: Not for graduation, for Europe."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's perfect. It's black so it won't show dirt or wrinkles, and if you wear it with a moody look on your face like you're thinking of Bolsheviks, they'll mistake you for Simone de Beauvoir. Pack it."
"RORY: It's too heavy."
"LORELAI: So, was that a trick question?"
"RORY: We both need to cut weight from our packs."
"LORELAI: I am doing my part here."
"RORY: Well, you don't need five pairs of boots."
"LORELAI: I'll drop some boots if you drop some books."
"RORY: I can't drop books."
"LORELAI: You can't bring twelve books."
"RORY: You also need to cut your undergarments. Don't forget, we'll rinse in Woolite every few days."
"LORELAI: This is going to an uncomfortable place."
"RORY: And your toothpaste - you have three full tubes."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: Why three?"
"LORELAI: If I lose one, I'll have another to take its place."
"RORY: If you're bringing three tubes of toothpaste, I am bringing twelve books plus a dictionary."
"LORELAI: Then I'm bringing a gallon of mercury which is one of the densest and heaviest substances known to man."
"RORY: I think the writing's on the wall here."
"LORELAI: Cancel Europe."
"RORY: I've gotta run. I love my graduation dress."
"LORELAI: I know."
"RORY: Hey, it's a shame about Europe being canceled, huh?"
"LORELAI: That's okay. It's not supposed to be that great anyway, except for the cheese."
"RORY: Nine books for two toothpastes."
"LORELAI: Deal."

"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings. Emily and Richard walk toward the door]"
"RICHARD: Who is it, Emily?"
"EMILY: I don't know, Richard. My x-ray vision isn't working at the moment."
"RICHARD: I was wondering if you were expecting somebody."
"EMILY: I wasn't expecting anybody."
"[They open the door. Rory is on the porch]"
"EMILY: Rory."
"RORY: Hey Grandma, hey Grandpa."
"RICHARD: What brings you here on this busy day?"
"RORY: I have sort of a time-sensitive issue I need to talk to you about."
"RICHARD: Time sensitive. Well, come in, come in."
"[they walk to the living room]"
"EMILY: We were just getting ready for your ceremony."
"RICHARD: And I was just retying my tie for the third time. No matter how many times I tie a tie, there's always room for error."
"RORY: It's not an exact science, is it?"
"RICHARD: Nor an art form. It's pretty much nothing."
"RORY: Sit down, please."
"RICHARD: Okay."
"EMILY: All right. Should we be nervous?"
"RORY: No, you shouldn't be. I am a little."
"RICHARD: Well, what is it?"
"RORY: I need money."
"RICHARD: You need money."
"RORY: For Yale."
"RICHARD: You need money for Yale."
"EMILY: Stop repeating everything she says."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, I'm processing."
"RORY: Look, it's a long story, but no other financing came through and all of the other options that Mom and I have are just. . .well, not good enough. So here's the offer - I would like for you to loan me the money for four years at Yale, and in return I will get a part time job and pay you in installments. I will continue this payment schedule after graduation increasing the payment amounts in proportion to my income. Plus, I will reinstate Friday night dinners with me. Every Friday night, I will be here, seven o'clock on the dot."
"EMILY: Well, how wonderful."
"RICHARD: We've missed you, Rory."
"RORY: I've missed you, too. So this should work out for everyone, right?"
"EMILY: Absolutely. We're happy to do it."
"RICHARD: Not so fast."
"EMILY: Richard."
"RICHARD: Oh, I'm happy to pay for Yale, but I don't want it to be a loan."
"RORY: No, I don't want that. I want it to be a loan, because otherwise it's too easy."
"RICHARD: Well, then here's my counteroffer. Let's make it a loan, but I insist that you not start paying it back until at least five years after you graduate. Seven years if you go for your Master's."
"RORY: That sounds fair, but I should pay interest."
"RICHARD: No."
"RORY: Grandpa."
"RICHARD: You are not going to pay me interest on this money, no way. That's a deal breaker."
"RORY: Okay."
"RICHARD: Good."
"EMILY: Wonderful."
"RICHARD: We have a deal. Listen, if journalism doesn't work out, you might consider working for me after you graduate. You've got good deal-making k*ll. Eye of the tiger."
"RORY: I'll keep that in mind. Well, I should go."
"EMILY: Rory, does your mother know you're here?"
"RORY: No. This is my thing. I'll see you at the ceremony."
"CUT TO CHILTON COURTYARD"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk to the seating area]"
"SOOKIE: Where do you wanna sit?"
"LORELAI: Is there no special designated area for family and friends of the valedictorian?"
"SOOKIE: Like a skybox or a velvet rope on one of the rows."
"LORELAI: We're the Chilton equivalent of 50 Cent's posse. Where are the boys?"
"SOOKIE: Over there. [points to Luke and Jackson standing by the building]"
"LORELAI: They're doing that thing guys do around fancy buildings."
"SOOKIE: Talk about their construction."
"LORELAI: The insurance costs."
"SOOKIE: Hey guys, get over here."
"LORELAI: Here's a row. Let me see, how many seats do we need? Uh, you, me, Luke, Jackson."
"SOOKIE: That's four."
"LORELAI: Plus Picklepuss and Sauerkraut."
"SOOKIE: Your parents make six."
"JACKSON: These stones have to be carved by hand."
"LUKE: Without the tools we have now. No electricity."
"JACKSON: Just pulleys and fulcrums."
"SOOKIE: Hey, Bob Vila, take a seat."
"LORELAI: Okay, we have to vow not to make fun of any of the kids because inevitably their family will be sitting right behind us just like at the play."
"SOOKIE: Right. Ugh, the big-eared Romeo fiasco of '98. Gotcha."
"[Lorelai's pager goes off]"
"SOOKIE: Who's paging you?"
"LORELAI: Uh, maybe there's a special surprise party for the valedictorian's mom backstage before the ceremony."
"SOOKIE: I bet there is."
"LORELAI: I'll be right back. Wow, look at the gargoyles."
"LUKE: What? Wow, yeah."
"JACKSON: Oh, now those have to be imported from Europe."
"LUKE: The insurance on this place must be astronomical."
"CUT TO INSIDE CHILTON"
"[In the crowded cafeteria, Paris walks over to her Nanny and three young children]"
"PARIS: Nanny, you brought the kids! Você trouxe as crianças."
"KIDS: Paris!"
"PARIS: Ah, minha queride Elzira, Catarina. E olindo Enrique, Antonio Banderas."
"[Lorelai walks up to a student]"
"LORELAI: Oh, excuse me. Hi, I'm looking for Rory Gilmore. She's the valedictorian. I'm her mom."
"[Rory walks over]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Uh, no, wait, go away. I wanna tell a bunch of other people that I'm the valedictorian's mom and I'm looking for you."
"RORY: I've got good news I wanna tell you real quick. Come here."
"[they walk into the hallway]"
"RORY: Okay, you ready?"
"LORELAI: I hope so, ready for what?"
"RORY: You're getting your inn."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Go put in the bid on the Dragonfly. You've got the money now, Grandpa's money."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? How do I have money?"
"RORY: Grandma and Grandpa are paying for Yale."
"LORELAI: Now wait a minute."
"RORY: I explained the situation, they totally understand, and they're loaning me the money for Yale."
"LORELAI: When did they approach you about this?"
"RORY: They didn't. I approached them."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: I just left them now. It's a done deal, so go make the call, put in the bid, before someone else does."
"LORELAI: Rory, honey, do you understand, the Gilmores do nothing altruistically. Strings are attached to everything."
"RORY: There are no strings."
"LORELAI: No strings?"
"RORY: No. I just have to pay them back starting five years after I graduate, and I have to start going back for Friday night dinners."
"LORELAI: Um, hello, Pinocchio, those are strings."
"RORY: But it was my idea to resume the dinners, and I obligated just me. You are in no way apart of it."
"LORELAI: This can't happen, Rory."
"RORY: I don't want you to defer your dream."
"LORELAI: You shouldn't have done this behind my back."
"RORY: Mom, Yale is my thing. I needed financing, I got it."
"LORELAI: Oh, those people, those master manipulators."
"RORY: Mom, this was my idea. I'm manipulating you."
"LORELAI: They are manipulating you to manipulate me."
"RORY: How are they doing that?"
"LORELAI: Rory, don't you see? If you go to Friday night dinners, Mom knows I'll go to just to be with you."
"RORY: She wasn't thinking that."
"LORELAI: They're getting exactly what they want."
"RORY: Don't you see? We're all getting exactly what we want. It's a win-win-win situation."
"LORELAI: It's not."
"RORY: It is."
"LORELAI: Okay, maybe, maybe it is. But just once, just once, I want you to get exactly what you want, and me to get exactly what I want, and them to get nothing."
"RORY: Well, we'll see if we can't arrange that sometime. But the ceremony's about to start, I better get back out there. And go buy that inn!"
"CUT TO CHILTON COURTYARD"
"[Lorelai walks outside and finds Emily and Richard sitting by themselves]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"EMILY: Hello."
"RICHARD: Oh, hi."
"LORELAI: Uh, didn't you see Sookie? We've got seats all saved."
"EMILY: Yes, but we didn't know if the whole seating issue had been resolved."
"LORELAI: Well, it was. Come on."
"RICHARD: Well, I don't remember it being fully resolved either."
"LORELAI: Well, it was. Come on."
"EMILY: We didn't know if you'd changed your mind."
"LORELAI: Well, I didn't. Come on."
"RICHARD: It wasn't crystal clear."
"LORELAI: Fine, just stay there."
"EMILY: You're not serious."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"[They walk over to the saved seats]"
"LORELAI: Uh, Mom, Dad, you've met everyone here. Sookie, Jackson, Luke."
"RICHARD: Hello."
"JACKSON: Hi."
"SOOKIE: Hi."
"LUKE: How ya doing?"
"RICHARD: No, uh. . .no Christopher?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no, he's out of town, but he's having us tons of pictures and order him the official video and we may even come back and reenact the whole thing when he gets home. Now sit, relax."
"[they sit down]"
"LORELAI: [quietly to Sookie] Sookie, long story short, and a partially painful story at that, and hang onto your hat, but we can now put a bid in on the Dragonfly."
"SOOKIE: What? Are you kidding?"
"LORELAI: No."
"SOOKIE: How? What happened?"
"LORELAI: I can't go into it now."
"SOOKIE: Okay, I've gotta tell you, even with the champagne and the Herb Albert, I've been depressed for days. I couldn't watch the Dating Game anymore."
"LORELAI: Well, that's all changed now."
"SOOKIE: I'll go call the attorney. You sit back and relax and enjoy the graduation."
"[Sookie pushes past the people in the row]"
"SOOKIE: This will not happen again, promise."
"[Lorelai notices an empty chair between her and her parents]"
"LORELAI: Uh, you're gonna have to move over one more chair to be part of the group, guys."
"EMILY: Oh, I thought maybe someone else was coming."
"LORELAI: No."
"RICHARD: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: Because if there is, it would be awkward to move during the ceremony."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know what awkward is."
"[Emily and Richard move over; Emily sighs.]"
"LORELAI: What Mom?"
"EMILY: Nothing. That man in front of me is extraordinarily tall, don't you think?"
"CUT TO THE CEREMONY STARTING"
"[The students file out of the school and take their seats. As Rory and Paris sit down, Paris waves to her Nanny and the kids]"
"PARIS: [to Rory] The middle one, Catarina, she bowled a 143 last week."
"RORY: Impressive."
"[Sookie pushes past several people in the row to get back to her chair]"
"SOOKIE: Sorry. I was here before a lot of you, it just looks like I'm late. Appearances can be deceiving. So sorry. [to Lorelai] Real estate agent wasn't in, so I left a message."
"LORELAI: Rats."
"SOOKIE: Did Rory walk in?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, first row. Right in front of the kid with the humongous. . .uh, the really cute kid."
"SOOKIE: Darn, I wanted to get a picture of her walking in. I'll get some of her in her seat."
"[Sookie pushes past the row of people again]"
"SOOKIE: Excuse me. Sorry. I'm not, I'm not like this. Today I am. I'm with the valedictorian, so. . ."
"HEADMASTER: Invited guests, fellow faculty, honored attendees and students, welcome to the Chilton Academy graduating class ceremony of 2003. [applause] This year's class is a distinguished assemblage, equal to or surpassing what has proceeded it. In its 200-year history, Chilton has not failed to produce a class that brings only honor to these grounds and to the academy's fine traditions. To begin, I would like to invite the student body president Paris Gellar to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. Paris?"
"PARIS: [to Rory] As his parting sh*t to me, Charleston never responded to the three aspects of the pledge that I had an objection to and considered rewriting. That's not going to stop me from using air quotes."
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"BRAD: [at podium] Through good times and bad, Chilton formed us, brought us hope, honed our insight, gave us encouragement. Though my time here was briefly interrupted by my period spent on Broadway hanging out with Stephen Sondheim, I still consider Chilton the most rewarding experience of my young life. Now it had always been my plan in closing to recite a short poem I'd written."
"LOUISE: But you reconsidered."
"MADELINE: Come on, Brad. Go out a winner."
"BRAD: But as I read it aloud, I realized the sentiments I wanted to share with my fellow students were better expressed in a favorite song of mine. [sings] Cherish is the word I use to describe. . .bong, bong. Bong, bong."
"RORY: Oh, Brad."
"BRAD: All the feelings that I have hiding here for you inside, bong, bong, bong. You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you. . ."
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"HEADMASTER: It's a distinct pleasure for me to introduce to you our valedictorian. This young lady was a second-year transfer from a modest school where she distinguished herself immeasurably. She is humble, hard working, competitive when need be, and unparalleled in her academic achievements. Ladies and Gentlemen, Rory Gilmore."
"[applause; Rory walks up on stage]"
"SOOKIE: Not crying, right?"
"LORELAI: Not crying. Keeping our cool so we don't miss anything."
"SOOKIE: Tears get in your eyes."
"LORELAI: Then you miss things."
"SOOKIE: So we're not crying."
"LORELAI: Not crying."
"SOOKIE: Not crying."
"JACKSON: Not crying. Not crying."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: No crying."
"LUKE: I'm not crying."
"RORY: Headmaster Charleston, faculty members, fellow students, family and friends, welcome. We never thought this day would come. We prayed for its quick delivery, crossed days off our calendars, counted hours, minutes, and seconds, and now that it's here, I'm sorry it is because it means leaving friends who inspire me and teachers who have been my mentors - so many people who have shaped my life and my fellow students' lives impermeably and forever. I live in two worlds. One is a world of books. I've been a resident of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, hunted the white whale aboard the Pequod, fought alongside Napoleon, sailed a raft with Huck and Jim, committed absurdities with Ignatius J. Reilly, rode a sad train with Anna Karenina, and strolled down Swann's Way. It's a rewarding world, but my second one is by far superior. My second one is populated with characters slightly less eccentric but supremely real, made of flesh and bone, full of love, who are my ultimate inspiration for everything. Richard and Emily Gilmore are kind, decent, unfailingly generous people. They are my twin pillars without whom I could not stand. I am proud to be their grandchild. But my ultimate inspiration comes from my best friend, the dazzling woman from whom I received my name and my life's blood, Lorelai Gilmore."
"SOOKIE: Uh oh."
"LORELAI: Hang in there."
"RORY: My mother never gave me any idea that I couldn't do whatever I wanted to do or be whomever I wanted to be. She filled our house with love and fun and books and music, unflagging in her efforts to give me role models from Jane Austen to Eudora Welty to Patti Smith. As she guided me through these incredible eighteen years, I don't know if she ever realized that the person I most wanted to be was her."
"SOOKIE: Not crying."
"LORELAI: Crying a little."
"SOOKIE: Crying a little, but not blubbering. That's what we meant when we said no crying, no blubbering."
"RORY: Thank you, Mom. You are my guidepost for everything."
"SOOKIE: On the verge of blubbering here."
"JACKSON: Not doing too well myself."
"LORELAI: Not you, too."
"LUKE: I'm blubbering, you're freaks."
"RORY: As we prepare ourselves today to leave. . ."
"CUT TO LATER IN THE CEREMONY"
"[Rory and Paris are in line for their diplomas]"
"ANNOUNCER: Allegra Grace Fass."
"PARIS: I swear, I do not recognize half of these people. [to girl in front of her] Hey. What's your name, what's your story?"
"[cut to the audience]"
"EMILY: Where is she, do you see her?"
"LORELAI: She's the one in the robe."
"EMILY: Lorelai, please."
"LORELAI: She's lost in a sea of blue polyester, Mom. I couldn't point her out if I wanted to."
"JACKSON: Richard, how much to insure all this?"
"RICHARD: Well, the insurance is probably not prohibitive, but the deductibles would be enormous. Well into six figures."
"LUKE: Six figures?"
"JACKSON: That's like having no insurance at all."
"LUKE: So if there was a fire -"
"LORELAI: Guys, please stop assessing the value of the building and pay attention. Rory's coming up."
"RICHARD: Ooh, ooh, sorry."
"SOOKIE: I wanna get a closer sh*t of her getting her diploma."
"[Sookie pushes past several people in the row]"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, sorry, sorry, I suck, I'm sorry."
"ANNOUNCER: Paris Eustace Gellar."
"PARIS: Finally, a name I recognize."
"[Paris walks on stage and receives her diploma]"
"HEADMASTER: Congratulations, Paris."
"PARIS: No hard feelings."
"HEADMASTER: Okay."
"ANNOUNCER: Lorelai Leigh Gilmore."
"LORELAI: This is it."
"EMILY: She looks so solemn."
"RICHARD: Like a Gilmore."
"[Rory walks on stage and receives her diploma]"
"HEADMASTER: Congratulations, Rory."
"RORY: Thank you, Headmaster."
"ANNOUNCER: Diana Christine Godby."
"[As Rory walks across the stage, she and Lorelai make faces at each other]"
"EMILY: Lorelai, really."
"LORELAI: I taught her everything I know."
"[Sookie returns to her seat]"
"SOOKIE: Honest to God, last time. Sorry. [she sits down and whispers something to Lorelai]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. Uh, uh, I, I need a pen. I don't have a pen. Luke, give me your pen."
"LUKE: I don't have a pen."
"LORELAI: Where's the pen you take orders with?"
"LUKE: You have got to stop assuming that I take pens with me everywhere I go."
"RICHARD: [handing Lorelai a pen] Never be without a pen."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Dad."
"[Lorelai writes ""We got the inn!"" on the graduation program and holds it up to show Rory. They smile and make faces at each other.]"
"EMILY: Really, Lorelai, how many more times are you gonna do that?"
"LORELAI: I think about six."
"[cut to later in the ceremony]"
"HEADMASTER: Class of 2003, give yourself a hand!"
"[applause]"
"CUT TO THE COURTYARD"
"[Rory walks over to Lorelai and Luke]"
"RORY: How was my speech?"
"LORELAI: It made everyone cry, including stone cold Luke."
"RORY: Luke, you old softy."
"LUKE: I will never live this down."
"LORELAI: Not with me in your life."
"LUKE: I gotta go, I gotta get back to the diner."
"RORY: Thanks for coming, Luke."
"LUKE: Oh, sure. The building's amazing. So are you."
"RORY: Thanks."
"[Rory walks away]"
"LORELAI: It really was great of you to come, Luke. It meant a lot to her."
"LUKE: It was fun."
"LORELAI: So if I don't see you, have fun on your trip with Nicole."
"LUKE: Oh, we may not go now."
"LORELAI: What? You were really looking forward to it."
"LUKE: I don't know if the timing's right and. . .things are kinda weird right now."
"LORELAI: Oh no."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's because I teased you about the commitment thing and proposing. I ruined it."
"LUKE: No, that's not it."
"LORELAI: Please, promise me that's not it. It would break my heart."
"LUKE: But you weren't wrong about that. It got me thinking and it is kind of like committing to her."
"LORELAI: So?"
"LUKE: I don't wanna lead her on."
"LORELAI: But you like her, Luke. You like her a lot, don't you?"
"LUKE: Yeah, she's great."
"LORELAI: Then go. No matter what she's reading into it."
"LUKE: Really? You think that's okay considering. . .I don't know. . .everything?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I do."
"LUKE: Oh, okay. I'll probably go then."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: I guess I was just nervous about nothing."
"LORELAI: That's what I think, too."
"LUKE: I'll see ya in a couple months."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'll see you then."
"[Paris walks up to Rory]"
"PARIS: I guess we should say our goodbyes. Nanny made me a special dinner. She makes a mean farturas."
"RORY: Well, good, I'm glad you found me. I wanted to say goodbye, too."
"PARIS: Good. Well, good luck."
"RORY: You know, it's weird, most of the time I really hated you."
"PARIS: Yeah, I really hated you, too."
"[They hug. Paris walks away. Lorelai, Emily, and Richard walk over]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RICHARD: Well, I think it might be time to present Rory with her graduation gift."
"RORY: Oh, you guys didn't have to get me anything."
"EMILY: Nonsense."
"RICHARD: Uh, this one wouldn't fit in an envelope, so follow me please."
"EMILY: We're really excited about this one."
"LORELAI: So am I."
"EMILY: Good."
"[they walk toward the parking lot]"
"RICHARD: Rory, there is your gift. It's the one with the bow."
"RORY: Um, Grandpa."
"EMILY: Richard."
"[the parking lot is filled with cars with bows on them]"
"RICHARD: Oh, for Pete's sake. Well, it was the only one there when I drove it up."
"EMILY: You should've put a more distinctive bow on it."
"RICHARD: Well, how was I supposed to know that every kid at Chilton was getting a car?"
"RORY: You got me a car?"
"RICHARD: We got you a car."
"RORY: That's amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Which one is it?"
"LORELAI: Or did you get her one for every day of the week like the underwear?"
"RICHARD: We got her one car. It's a little Prius. It's safe, it gets great gas mileage."
"EMILY: And it's the one that Leonardo DiCaprio drives."
"RORY: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you guys."
"EMILY: We love you, too."
"RICHARD: And don't forget to call about -"
"RORY: Insurance. I'll do it the second I get home."
"RICHARD: Good. Congratulations, Rory. And thank you for your speech."
"RORY: You're welcome. I meant it, thank you for everything."
"EMILY: Have fun in Europe. Both of you."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Mom."
"EMILY: When do you get back?"
"LORELAI: The 27th."
"EMILY: Terrific. We'll see you that Friday for dinner."
"[Emily and Richard leave. Lorelai and Rory walk back toward the school building]"
"LORELAI: Explain the win-win-win thing again."
"RORY: Everybody wins, that's what it is."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[Rory's cell phone rings]"
"RORY: Hello? Hello?"
"LORELAI: A hang up?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: You're getting a lot of those lately."
"[phone rings again]"
"RORY: Hello? Hello?"
"[Lorelai waits outside as Rory takes the phone into the school]"
"RORY: Jess, is that you? Jess, I'm pretty sure it's you and I'm pretty sure you've been calling and not saying anything but wanna say something. Hello? You're not going to talk? Fine, I'll talk. You didn't handle things right at all. You could've talked to me. You could've told me that you were having trouble in school and weren't going to graduate, and that your dad had been there, but you didn't. And you ended up not taking me to my prom and not coming to my graduation and leaving again without saying goodbye again, and that's fine, I get it, but that's it for me. I'm going to Europe tomorrow and I'm going to Yale and I'm moving on. And I'm not going to pine. I hope you didn't think I was going to pine, okay? I think. . .I think I may have loved you, but I just need to let it go. So, that's it, I guess. Um, I hope you're good. I want you to be good, and, um, okay, so, goodbye. That word sounds really lame and stupid right now, but there it is. Goodbye."
"[Rory hangs up; in California, Jess hangs up a payphone and walks down the street]"
"[Lorelai walks into the school]"
"LORELAI: Hey. You okay?"
"RORY: I'm okay."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: But Sookie and Jackson are out that way."
"LORELAI: I wanna go back a different way, come on."
"RORY: I thought we were going home."
"LORELAI: I just wanna make one more stop before we do."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke is cleaning up the tables as Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Lorelai, hi. Where's Rory?"
"LORELAI: Oh, out in the car."
"LUKE: Oh. It was a really nice ceremony, wasn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it was beautiful."
"LUKE: What's up?"
"LORELAI: I just wanted to say something to you in case we don't see each other before you go on your trip."
"LUKE: Sure, what?"
"LORELAI: Don't get engaged."
"LUKE: What, why?"
"[Lorelai turns to leave]"
"LUKE: Lorelai?"
"[Lorelai leaves the diner as Luke stares after her]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke wakes up from his dream]"
"CUT TO CHILTON"
"[Lorelai and Rory rush down a hallway]"
"RORY: Mom, wait."
"LORELAI: Hurry, hurry."
"RORY: This outfit produces a lot of wind resistance."
"[they stop at the bottom of the staircase]"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: What are we doing?"
"LORELAI: Leaving our mark. Got a knife?"
"RORY: A knife? For what?"
"LORELAI: Carving our initials. Come on, knife, knife."
"RORY: Uh, like the switchblade I keep in my sock? No, I left it at home."
"LORELAI: I must have something in here. [looks through her purse] Ah, safety pin, perfect."
"RORY: We can't do this."
"LORELAI: Yes, we can. People need to know we were here."
"RORY: I'm in the yearbook."
"LORELAI: How about the wall?"
"RORY: No, that's too out in the open. They'll trace it back to us."
"LORELAI: They'll see LG and RG and figure out it was us?"
"RORY: They're are no dorks here."
"LORELAI: Somewhere in the floor?"
"RORY: This marble is two hundred years old. Harriet Beecher Stowe walked on this marble."
"LORELAI: Oh, the banister."
"RORY: Was donated by Robert Frost."
"LORELAI: The sconce."
"RORY: Was ceremonially lit for the first time by Thomas Edison."
"LORELAI: Geez, is there anything in this whole room that some famous dead person didn't have something to do with."
"[they hear some people walking by]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, cool it, cool it. And this is some very interesting architectural do-dads and hoo-ha's."
"RORY: And wingdings and tum-tum's."
"LORELAI: That was close."
"RORY: Look, just carve it really tiny here on the baseboard of the wall, and do it reversed, so GL and GR."
"LORELAI: Oh, maybe it's not such a good idea."
"RORY: The madness passes."
"[Sookie opens the door at the top of the staircase]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, you guys coming? Party at your place, right?"
"RORY: Party?"
"LORELAI: Just a little gathering."
"RORY: Cool."
"LORELAI: We'll meet you back at our house."
"SOOKIE: Okay, see you there. [leaves]"
"[Lorelai and Rory start walking up the stairs]"
"LORELAI: Wait, wait. Look around for a second. Notice?"
"RORY: Notice what?"
"LORELAI: It's not so scary anymore."
"RORY: No, it's not."

"OPEN IN LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[An airport shuttle van drops Lorelai and Rory off in front of their house, then pulls away]"
"LORELAI: Agh!"
"RORY: And we're home."
"LORELAI: How long does a freakin' van ride take?"
"RORY: Not that long!"
"LORELAI: Everybody in the world's life flashed before my eyes. That's how much time I had. I thought we were gonna die on that van."
"RORY: It seemed a good possibility."
"LORELAI: Ugh, that van ride felt longer than our train ride from Paris to Prague, and we had that group of French boys singing Sk8er Boi and smelling like a soccer field sitting all around us."
"[Babette comes out of her house and rushes over to them]"
"BABETTE: Oh my God, you're back! Morey, they're back! Are you hurt? Are you bleeding?"
"LORELAI: Oh, we're fine."
"BABETTE: You're fine? They're fine! Morey!"
"MOREY: [opens his front door] Yeah?"
"BABETTE: They're fine!"
"MOREY: Okay. [goes back inside]"
"BABETTE: What the hell happened to you two? According to the itinerary that Rory gave me, you were supposed to be home on Saturday."
"LORELAI: The itinerary that Rory gave you?"
"BABETTE: So when you girls didn't show up, we panicked! Morey?"
"MOREY: [opens front door] Yeah?"
"BABETTE: Didn't we panic?"
"MOREY: Yeah. [goes inside]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Morey, you ever thought about just staying out here at times like these?"
"BABETTE: By Sunday night, I was a complete basketcase. I thought you'd been kidnapped by some crazy Sandinistas or something."
"LORELAI: 'Cause the Sandinista movement is so popular in France."
"BABETTE: So, finally, I just started calling consulates."
"RORY: Consulates?"
"LORELAI: How many consulates?"
"BABETTE: Ah, jeez, all of 'em. Anyhow, you're here. Let's go inside, I wanna hear all about Europe. Morey, I'm going in!"
"MOREY: [calls from his house] Okay."
"[Babette goes into Lorelai's house]"
"LORELAI: You gave her an itinerary?"
"RORY: I thought it would be good for someone to know where we were."
"LORELAI: Oh, you gave her an itinerary and she called every consulate in the world."
"RORY: If we were caught smuggling hash over the border and we were thrown in some Turkish prison, wouldn't you want someone to know that we were in Turkey?"
"LORELAI: Where'd we get this hash we were smuggling?"
"RORY: You were at a café, you met a guy, he was sweet-talking you, he put the stuff in your purse when you weren't looking."
"LORELAI: At least tell me he was cute."
"RORY: He was not bad for a hash dealer."
"LORELAI: Hm."
"[they walk into the house]"
"BABETTE: [calls from the kitchen] I'm making cocoa!"
"LORELAI: She's making cocoa 'cause you gave her an itinerary."
"RORY: I may have given her the itinerary, but you're the one who got us busted for drug smuggling."
"LORELAI: Reality has absolutely no place in our world."
"[they walk to the kitchen]"
"BABETTE: Okay, I wanna hear all about Europe. Come on, tell me, what'd you see?"
"LORELAI: Well, everything. Uh, Notre Dame, the Roman Baths, St. Peter's Basilica."
"RORY: Mom touched the Pope."
"BABETTE: You're kidding!"
"LORELAI: Actually, I just touched his car. Then one of the Swiss guards in the fruity cool clothing busted me."
"RORY: Luckily, Mom's fluent in flirting."
"LORELAI: And flirting with a guy in a pompom hat and a skirt is quite an accomplishment."
"BABETTE: Well, it sounds like you had a terrific trip."
"RORY: It was. [Lorelai signals for her to fake a yawn, and Rory does]"
"LORELAI: Aw, are you okay, hon?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'm just a little sleepy."
"BABETTE: Aw, of course, you girls must be wiped. I'll, uh, get out of here."
"LORELAI: Oh, but thanks, Babette."
"BABETTE: Well, goodnight, sleep tight. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Morey, I'm coming home! [leaves]"
"RORY: I'm gonna go unpack."
"LORELAI: Oh, unpack tomorrow."
"RORY: No, if I leave stuff packed overnight, everything's gonna get gross."
"LORELAI: Everything's already gross."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"RORY: Ahhh."
"[Rory walks to the closet as Lorelai gets on the bed]"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, your bed feels good."
"RORY: Do not get comfortable. I will sleep on top of you if I have to."
"LORELAI: Oh man, smell this. [holds up a pillow]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I forgot that pillows don't have to smell like feet. You know, I have to say, I think it's good I did this hostel thing in my thirties, and I'll tell you why."
"RORY: [hugging the clothes in her closet] I missed you, I missed you all!"
"LORELAI: If I had done it in my twenties or teens, I would've been naïve enough to think that hostels were exotic and romantic. But once you're in your thirties, you've lived enough to know they're gross and should be avoided at all costs."
"RORY: [to her clothes] I had a dream about you in Copenhagen. You were there, and you, and you, and you."
"LORELAI: Listen, since we slept on the plane, we should go to sleep now, but get up really early tomorrow. We don't wanna blow this whole week being jet-lagged. We need to establish normal sleeping patterns."
"RORY: Fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'm gonna go take a shower and leave you alone to make out with your sock drawer."
"RORY: Close the door."
"[Lorelai leaves. Rory pulls open her sock drawer]"
"RORY: Hello, boys."
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory is organizing the souvenirs in the living room. Lorelai walks down the steps talking on the phone]"
"LORELAI: [on phone] Gilmore, Lorelai, yes. My daughter's name is Lorelai also. Well, very confusing or, in your case, extremely convenient. Uh, no, see, we were never missing, it was a big mistake."
"RORY: Who are you talking to?"
"LORELAI: Belgium."
"RORY: Ah."
"LORELAI: [on phone] Yes, uh huh, Babette Dell. She got our arrival dates mixed up and she was just worried, but we're fine, we're here. We just loved your fries. Okay, sure, bye bye. [hangs up] Okay, Belgium's done, Lisbon's calling me back, Berlin had no idea what I was talking about, and Paris is pissed."
"RORY: At who?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, who knows? Okay, I'm taking a break and then I'm taking on the Netherlands. I still cannot believe Babette did this."
"RORY: She just loves us."
"LORELAI: Well, be a little less lovable, would you, 'cause it's costing me a fortune. Try being one of those kids where people are like, ""Oh really, she was kidnapped? Hey, well, thin the herd."""
"RORY: Very nice. Hey, who are the rosary beads for?"
"LORELAI: They're mine."
"RORY: What do you need rosary beads for?"
"LORELAI: They're cute."
"RORY: They're for prayer."
"LORELAI: Well, pray they match my blue suit?"
"RORY: They have just upgraded you to a queen-size bed, Jacuzzi tub, junior suite in hell."
"LORELAI: Hm. Oh, Pieta placemat?"
"RORY: Oh, Gypsy."
"LORELAI: How are you feeling?"
"RORY: You know, not bad. Just a little spacy."
"LORELAI: Like a cold medicine buzz?"
"RORY: Maybe we got lucky and missed the jet lag."
"LORELAI: I hope so because we have a very big week ahead of us."
"RORY: Oh yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yes. In fact, I have here in my hand a schedule of all the activities we are going to partake in over this week, the final week of Rory Gilmore's life before she enters the ivy-covered hallowed halls of Yale University."
"RORY: Schedule, please."
"LORELAI: Okay. Today we get these presents out to our friends and then we hit the mall."
"RORY: Got it."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow we get an early start and we hit three of the crappier movies that are out."
"RORY: And then we have dinner at Grandma's."
"LORELAI: Which I will conveniently not put down on my list in the hopes that that magically goes away. Uh, okay, the next day we hit New York, see your fancy art galleries, hit the Strand."
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Pizza at John's. Um, Sunday, pick up all the stuff you need for school, and then there's a barbecue at Sookie's. Monday is mani/pedi, facial, haircut, go to the psychic, and stock up for Tuesday, the day of all days - Godfather I, II, and III, with extra showings of the Sofia death scene over and over as long as the Mallomars hold out."
"RORY: The perfect day!"
"LORELAI: I agree."
"RORY: And I think we have just enough of the biscotti that we brought back from Milan to last us the rest of the week."
"LORELAI: Oh, good. Well, everything's in order, so, uh, let's get going and get this stuff out of here."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Wow, we sure have a lot of gifts. Do we like this many people?"
"RORY: I didn't think so. Maybe we're getting soft in our old age."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I guess we should get some tote bags."
"RORY: What tote bags?"
"LORELAI: We must have tote bags."
"RORY: Where would we get tote bags?"
"LORELAI: Excuse me, every woman who's ever purchased seventy-five dollars worth of Clinique products has some tote bags."
"RORY: We don't have tote bags."
"LORELAI: Well, how are we supposed to get this stuff out of here?"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street wearing their backpacks]"
"LORELAI: Now we're the quirky backpack ladies."
"RORY: One of the kinder nicknames that have been attributed to us."
"LORELAI: Let's just be very efficient about this. Okay, we'll start with Patty, work our way clockwise around the town, end with Andrew. And let's stick with the 'my mom touched the Pope' anecdote. It's quick, it's peppy, and everybody likes a nice Pope story."
"RORY: Do we have time to stop at Luke's? I'm starving."
"LORELAI: Absolutely. This is our week, this week we do anything we want."
"RORY: I like this week."
"LORELAI: Hey, I wonder if Luke and Nicole actually went on that cruise."
"RORY: I thought he was going."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know, but I wonder if he actually went."
"RORY: Why wouldn't he?"
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know. Because he'd have to pack and leave, plus he'd have to buy a bathing suit."
"RORY: Well, I hope he went. He could use a good vacation. Plus, he really seems to like Nicole."
"LORELAI: Mmhmm. Yeah, he does. Oh, hey, looks like the soda shop is open."
"RORY: Oh, cool."
"[They stop outside the soda shop and see Luke and Taylor arguing inside]"
"LUKE: I am gonna k*ll you."
"TAYLOR: Oh, please, you are not."
"LUKE: I am, too. I'm gonna k*ll you. I should've k*ll you before. I should've k*ll you the minute you put up those unicorn topiaries in the park, but, hey, hindsight, right?"
"RORY: Aw, I've missed that."
"LORELAI: What do you think, biscotti moment?"
"RORY: Absolutely."
"[Lorelai and Rory eat biscotti while they watch Luke and Taylor argue]"
"TAYLOR: You don't have to yell, Luke."
"LUKE: You put a giant window in my wall."
"TAYLOR: So what?"
"LUKE: A giant window! Right here! You can see my entire diner. And when I'm in my diner, I can see your whole stupid store."
"TAYLOR: I don't understand why yours is a diner and mine is a stupid store."
"LUKE: Look at this place! Look at you. All you need is six dancing penguins and Mary Poppins floating in the corner to bring back two of the worst hours of my childhood."
"TAYLOR: I don't think you had a childhood. I think you came out a bitter surly k*ll."
"LUKE: You can't change the basic structure of this place without my okay! What?"
"TAYLOR: Your hand is near the wax lips."
"LUKE: So?"
"TAYLOR: If you could just move it so you don't accidentally touch the candy. Lucas. [Luke rummages through the different boxes of candy] What are you doing? You stop that right now!"
"LUKE: [throws candy in the air] Look at all the pretty candy!"
"TAYLOR: Agh, stop it right now!"
"LORELAI: [gasps] Oh my God!"
"RORY: Hm, what? What's the matter?"
"LORELAI: Luke."
"RORY: Yeah, he's finally lost it."
"LORELAI: No, we forgot Luke."
"RORY: We forgot Luke what? Oh, we forgot to bring him back a gift. Oh no!"
"LORELAI: We kept putting it off and putting it off."
"RORY: We couldn't find anything good enough."
"LORELAI: We should've gotten him that bullfighter's uniform."
"RORY: Well, so what do we do?"
"LORELAI: Well, we have to just pick up something here and we'll tell him that we got it in Denmark."
"RORY: Pick up what?"
"LORELAI: Something."
"RORY: What? This is Stars Hollow. Everything you buy here has a Hello, Kitty stamped on the bottom."
"LORELAI: Well, we have to get him something. We cannot go into Luke's empty handed."
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"RORY: I'm hungry."
"CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk up to the house]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Sookie!"
"[Sookie rushes off the porch to greet them]"
"SOOKIE: [squeals] You're back!"
"LORELAI: We're back!"
"[they all hug; Jackson comes out of the house]"
"JACKSON: Hey, don't squish baby!"
"SOOKIE: I missed you so much!"
"LORELAI: We missed you so much."
"SOOKIE: Ah, look at you! You look older."
"RORY: Oh, thanks, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: So how was it, was it wonderful?"
"LORELAI: Oh -"
"SOOKIE: I wanna hear everything you did and everything you ate. Oh, was it warm? I read it was warm. How was Barcelona? Did you see the gaudy apartments? Ooh, did you see a bullfight? Did you see Anne Frank's house? Did you cry? Was Steven Speilberg there, huh? Oh, hey, I hear you touched the Pope! Are you hungry? Do you want anything to eat? I've got quiche."
"[they walk into the house]"
"LORELAI: Hold on one sec here, missy. I need to look at you. Sideways, please."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Hello, hi, nice to see you. I'm your Auntie Lorelai, and this is your Auntie Rory. Say hi, Rory."
"RORY: Hey."
"LORELAI: Come over here."
"RORY: Oh, no, I'm good."
"SOOKIE: Come on, Rory, rub my stomach."
"RORY: I'd rather not."
"LORELAI: Rory's a chicken."
"SOOKIE: So is Jackson."
"JACKSON: Hey, I'm gonna like it when it comes out."
"LORELAI: So what did the ultrasound say, boy or girl?"
"SOOKIE: It's a -"
"JACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh."
"LORELAI: It's a buh? What's a buh?"
"JACKSON: [reveals a button pinned to his shirt] Read."
"LORELAI: [reads button] ""I do not want to know the sex of my baby."""
"JACKSON: That's right. I'm going old school on this."
"SOOKIE: And he's being completely stubborn."
"RORY: But you know?"
"SOOKIE: Of course I know. I had little clothes to buy -"
"JACKSON: Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh!"
"SOOKIE: What? I said nothing about the sex."
"JACKSON: You said little, and now I know it's going to be little."
"LORELAI: Jackson, seriously, you don't wanna know?"
"JACKSON: Hey, in the old days, the guys would pace back and forth in the waiting room until a pretty nurse in a nice white outfit would come out and say, ""Congratulations - it's a 'insert your chosen sex here'."" Ricky Ricardo didn't know, Dick van d*ke didn't know, and by gum, if it was good enough for Rick and Dick, it's good enough for me."
"LORELAI: Well, I wanna know."
"JACKSON: Rory, what do you say? Be on my side."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, there are no sides."
"JACKSON: We can be in that waiting room together, pacing, waiting, we'll get you a nice suit. What do you say?"
"RORY: Okay, sure. I'm on Jackson's side."
"JACKSON: Great. Welcome to 1954. [gives her a button]"
"RORY: Happy to be here."
"LORELAI: Well, I wanna know."
"SOOKIE: Come on, I'll tell you outside."
"LORELAI: Sure you don't wanna go?"
"RORY: Read the button, missy."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Lorelai and Sookie leave]"
"RORY: So, you hear about that whole Sputnik thing?"
"JACKSON: Oh, Eisenhower's on top of it."
"RORY: Hm."
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai and Sookie walk out back to the shed]"
"LORELAI: So Jackson's really not gonna be in the delivery room with you?"
"SOOKIE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Does that bug you?"
"SOOKIE: Hey, I don't like Jackson to see me shave my legs, so. . .I'm opening the shed! Okay, are you ready?"
"LORELAI: For what?"
"[Sookie opens the shed; it's filled with blue baby products]"
"LORELAI: [gasps] It's a boy!"
"SOOKIE: It's a boy!"
"LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, you're having a boy!"
"SOOKIE: I know! Jackson will finally have that son to prune the trees with."
"LORELAI: My God, it's so exciting. A boy! Oh, a little boy. I know nothing about little boys."
"SOOKIE: Me neither."
"LORELAI: Man, you're prepared, aren't you?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, I am."
"[They sit down in chairs in the shed]"
"LORELAI: It's so nice to be home."
"SOOKIE: It's nice to have you home."
"LORELAI: Hey, have you seen Luke lately?"
"SOOKIE: Briefly."
"LORELAI: I guess he went on that cruise, huh?"
"SOOKIE: Yup."
"LORELAI: That's good. That's good he went. He needed a vacation. He works hard, that one. Always cooking, making the coffee, taking the orders."
"SOOKIE: You know, I think something happened on that trip of his."
"LORELAI: What do you mean?"
"SOOKIE: Well, the day he got back, Jackson and I went into the diner and I asked him how his trip went. He couldn't get away from me fast enough."
"LORELAI: Really? Was Jackson wearing that creepy button?"
"SOOKIE: Nope. Luke just seemed kind of freaked out about something."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You think he and Nicole had a fight or something?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: He didn't say anything?"
"SOOKIE: Nope. He just walked around acting weirder than normal."
"LORELAI: Huh. Wonder what that's all about. So. . . are you gonna name him Lorelai?"
"SOOKIE: Absolutely. That wouldn't be confusing at all."
"LORELAI: Great."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk down the street. Lorelai is carrying a jar of jam.]"
"RORY: I cannot believe you."
"LORELAI: What? It's the perfect gift for Luke. Fine fancy jam from France."
"RORY: Fine fancy jam from Jackson's pantry."
"LORELAI: I don't know what you're talking about. I am looking right here at this beautiful hand-crafted label and it says ""Fruits de la Terre."""
"RORY: You didn't even spellcheck to make sure you got the French right."
"LORELAI: Yes, well, I think it adds an authentic touch. See, in my world, the person who made this jam was an illiterate orphan. . .Sochelle."
"RORY: As in Sochelle Crab."
"LORELAI: Yes, exactly. Sochelle was born by the sea, or so said the note left in the bassinet when the nuns found her on the steps of Notre Dame."
"RORY: Oh, good, there are nuns."
"LORELAI: Every sad story needs nuns. Anyhow, Sochelle had nothing - no father, no mother, no friends, no education. All she had was a burning desire to make great jam, and now she's the most successful jamstress in Paris."
"RORY: Luke's gonna know."
"LORELAI: No, he is not."
"RORY: Well, as much as I would like to be there when you give Luke your heartfelt gift, I'm gonna go give Lane her gift."
"LORELAI: All right, but if you're not there, I'm gonna get all the credit for this."
"RORY: Exactly as it should be."
"LORELAI: Give Lane a hug for me."
"RORY: I will. Don't give him the jam."
"LORELAI: I can't hear you, I'm too far away."
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Bonjour, Luke. Pouvez-vous attacher vos chausseurs?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Uh, hi, Luke. Do you know how to tie your shoes?"
"LUKE: Very good."
"LORELAI: Yup. It came in handy, let me tell you. Not one shoelace fatality on my watch. [he sets a mug in front of her] You remembered."
"LUKE: Yup. A couple things about you stick. You have a good time?"
"LORELAI: Vos odeurs de chat."
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: Your cat smells."
"LUKE: You must've been a big hit with the salon set."
"LORELAI: The trip was incredible, we had the best time. We were supposed to come back on Saturday."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: Keeping tabs on me?"
"LUKE: Always safer to know which direction the tornado's coming from."
"LORELAI: Anyhow, we were in London and we ran into this group of girls who were heading to Ireland to stake out the Clarence Hotel."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because U2 owns it and Bono hangs out there."
"LUKE: Ah. Him again."
"LORELAI: So then we jumped on a train and we headed to Ireland - incredibly beautiful, by the way - and we sat in a bar for two days and did nothing but eat soda crackers and funky cheese and he never showed."
"LUKE: Que sera."
"LORELAI: Hm. [sips her coffee] Mm, still good. I told 'em about you over there, Señor Swanky-pants."
"LUKE: Can't tell you how grateful I am to have you as my press agent."
"LORELAI: And we got you something."
"LUKE: You did?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we did."
"LUKE: You didn't have to do that."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? We do not go to Europe and come back without bringing something for Luke. Here. [hands Luke the jar of jam]"
"LUKE: Jam."
"LORELAI: Yes, fancy French jam."
"LUKE: Fruits de la Terre. Very impressive."
"LORELAI: It's handmade by this woman in Paris who has the most amazing story."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Orphaned."
"LUKE: Uh huh."
"LORELAI: And illiterate."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Just had nothing in her life, you know, except this burning desire to be the world's greatest jamstress. And she's famous now and, uh, you know, she only makes three bottles of that stuff a year and that's one of 'em, and I brought it all the way across the, uh. . .I got it from Sookie's house."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: How did you know?"
"LUKE: Just a wild guess."
"LORELAI: I swear, we tried to get you something, but nothing was good enough."
"LUKE: No, forget it. I didn't get you anything on my trip either. We're even."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, how was the cruise?"
"LUKE: Oh, it was. . .you know."
"LORELAI: Not really, I've never been on a cruise. So. . ."
"LUKE: It was fine."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, you and Nicole had fun then?"
"LUKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You want more coffee?"
"LORELAI: Uh, eh, oh. So what did you?"
"LUKE: Where?"
"LORELAI: On the boat? What did you and Nicole do on the boat?"
"LUKE: Oh, uh, you know, we fluttered around and ate, and there was a magic show and a singer and pillow mints, and you know, that's it."
"LORELAI: But you and Nicole had a good time, you got along, and. . ."
"LUKE: Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna go check on your food."
"LORELAI: Okay. [Luke walks away] I didn't order anything yet."
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Kirk is hanging up a poster in front of the market as Rory walks by]"
"RORY: Hi, Kirk."
"KIRK: Bienvenido, señora Gilmore."
"[Rory sees that her picture is on the poster, promoting her as the Ice Cream Queen. She tears it down and walks away]"
"KIRK: What are you doing? I just put that there."
"CUT TO TAYLOR'S SODA SHOP"
"[Taylor is instructing the employees on how to serve the ice cream]"
"TAYLOR: Scoop toward you, rolling smoothly. Very good, Ginger. Nice symmetrical balls there, Joshua. Easy on the nuts, easy on the nuts. One cherry, and then present your sundae with a Taylor Tip."
"[Rory walks in carrying the poster]"
"RORY: Uh, excuse me, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Ah, there you are. Hello, your majesty. Come to check on your little kingdom? Uh, Ginger, hand me a spoon."
"RORY: I was just walking by when I -"
"TAYLOR: Here you are, on the house. [hands her a dish of ice cream]"
"RORY: Thank you."
"TAYLOR: Would you like an extra cherry?"
"RORY: No."
"TAYLOR: Because if the Stars Hollow Ice Cream Queen wants two cherries, then she will get two cherries, and to hell with the extra twenty-five cent charge."
"RORY: Taylor, you didn't ask me if I wanted to be the Ice Cream Queen."
"TAYLOR: So?"
"RORY: So, you didn't ask me. You just put my picture on a flier and stuck it up all over town."
"TAYLOR: Well, I couldn't very well ask you when you were traipsing all over Europe, now could I?"
"RORY: But -"
"TAYLOR: And don't worry about getting anything. I have already rented a cape and a crown. Just wear a nice simple sage-colored floor-length dress and you'll be fine."
"RORY: I can't do it."
"TAYLOR: What do you mean, you can't do it?"
"RORY: I mean, I'm busy right now. I only have a couple days left before I go off to school, and my mom and I have every moment planned, so I'm just going to have to pass on this one."
"TAYLOR: Oh, I see. You're going to pass. You're passing on this. Fine. Just consider yourself passed."
"RORY: Look, I can still come by."
"TAYLOR: Oh, can you, really? You can find time in your busy day to come by and eat my free ice cream and take my free balloon and get yourself a free glitter hand stamp? You can swing that? You don't have to pass on that, huh?"
"RORY: Look, Taylor, don't take it like this."
"TAYLOR: In my own defense, I assumed you would be thrilled based on your, uh, past participation record."
"RORY: But this has nothing to do with -"
"TAYLOR: You've always been the head pilgrim girl at the food drive table."
"RORY: Yes, well, that's for charity."
"TAYLOR: The third leprechaun at the St. Patty's Day festival."
"RORY: Yes, okay, but again, for charity."
"TAYLOR: You man the ticket booth on Groundhog Day. You help organize the manger procession at Christmas, you play Esther every year at the Purim carnival. I just assumed you liked taking part in town events."
"RORY: I do like it, but I just can't this time. I'm sorry."
"TAYLOR: Oh, don't be. It's my own fault. I should have figured that once you got into Yale everything would be different."
"RORY: That's not fair."
"TAYLOR: No, I understand. You're no longer our little Stars Hollow Rory Gilmore. You belong to the Ivy Leagues right now. It's time to cut those small town ties and go off and do something important like go to drama school or have one of those high-class naked parties with that Bush girl."
"RORY: Taylor -"
"TAYLOR: Okay. See you around the quad. [walks away]"
""
""
""
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk through the front door]"
"LORELAI: Okay, that took way longer than it was supposed to. From now on, when we go out of town, no presents for anyone."
"RORY: Oh, right. So we'll just buy everyone a big crate of Fruits de la Terre."
"LORELAI: That horse is dead, put the stick down. Now we're way behind in our schedule, so I propose a change. Let's hold off on the frivolous shopping until tomorrow. What's up?"
"RORY: That Taylor thing is still bugging me."
"LORELAI: Me, too. I can't believe you didn't call me in to see the fight."
"RORY: Maybe I am different. Maybe I do have an attitude."
"LORELAI: I think you do."
"RORY: I mean, I've always had time for the town in the past, and now suddenly I don't? Am I changing? I don't wanna change. I don't wanna be the anti-town girl. I'm not Daria."
"LORELAI: Taylor is just messing with your mind, which is one of his specialties. Ignore him."
"RORY: I guess. [she picks up a pile of mail from the coffee table.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, no mail yet. We agreed, we're still on vacation."
"RORY: Well, I'll just look through my mail. Yours can sit there as long as you like."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but then you're back in the real world again and I'm out here in vacation-land alone. That's not fun."
"RORY: [reading a letter] Oh no."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Oh no."
"LORELAI: What oh no?"
"[Rory heads to her bedroom, Lorelai follows]"
"RORY: Oh no. Oh no. No no no no no no no no no. Oh no."
"LORELAI: Uh, hey, kid, you're kind of freaking me out here."
"[Rory flips through her date book]"
"RORY: I wrote the date down wrong."
"LORELAI: What date?"
"RORY: This is from Yale. My orientation is Saturday."
"LORELAI: Right, next Saturday."
"RORY: No, this Saturday."
"LORELAI: No, next Saturday."
"RORY: No, this Saturday."
"LORELAI: But today's Thursday. That means we have no -"
"RORY: I have to be at school the day after tomorrow."
"LORELAI: But. . .no! We had a free week. I had it all scheduled out."
"RORY: Well, I wrote the date down wrong."
"LORELAI: Why would you do that?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"LORELAI: You never write the date down wrong."
"RORY: Well, I wrote it down before we left and I wrote it down wrong."
"LORELAI: We were supposed to have a week."
"RORY: Well, we don't."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong."
"RORY: I can't believe you weren't gonna let me open the mail."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you wrote the date down wrong."
"RORY: I can't believe you made us go to Ireland to stalk Bono."
"LORELAI: This isn't fair. You have more I-can't-believe's than I do."
"RORY: This sucks."
"LORELAI: This totally sucks."
"RORY: Well, I'm not ready. I haven't packed. I have things I need to get. We were supposed to watch the three Godfather's and Sofia dying over and over and eat our biscotti and -"
"LORELAI: Okay, listen, calm down. We just need to revise our plan."
"RORY: We were supposed to have a week."
"LORELAI: Okay, tonight we stay home and pack. Tomorrow we get up early. We'll get all the stuff you need, and that will give us time to watch at least two Godfather's and a Sofia dying. We'll still have a partial day and a great biscotti night."
"RORY: Chinese."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Food. Order it. Go."
"LORELAI: No, no time for full sentences!"
"RORY: Right."
"LORELAI: Ordering!"
"CUT TO SIDEWALK"
"[Lorelai and Rory, each carrying several shopping bags, walk through the town square]"
"LORELAI: I'm so wiped. I shouldn't have taken that third Excedrin PM last night."
"RORY: Third? Why'd you take three?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, uh, originally I took two, then somewhere around four in the morning, I woke up and had a major Marilyn moment."
"RORY: Oh, no."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I forgot that I'd taken something and so I popped a third one and now I'm about ready to sleep with a Kennedy."
"RORY: Well, I hear Kerry's available."
"LORELAI: Okay, let's sit. God, Mr. Jet Lag wants to be my best friend."
"RORY: Well, do you wanna go home and rest?"
"LORELAI: No. We have a Godfather night to salvage. Check the list."
"RORY: Okay, we got the sheets, towels, bathroom shower caddy, and the basic first aid accoutrement. We still need to hit the beauty supply, the hardware store, stationery store."
"LORELAI: The mattress store."
"RORY: You do know that they supply you with a mattress at the dorm."
"LORELAI: Yeah. A mattress that decades of students in various states of cleanliness have slept on. Some without pajamas."
"RORY: Gross."
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"RORY: We've been running around for hours and this list isn't getting any shorter. We're never gonna finish."
"LORELAI: Stop. Yes, we are. We just need to split up. We'll get all this done quicker. I'll take the, uh, beauty supply and you take the stationery store, and we'll meet back here in twenty minutes."
"RORY: Okay. Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Well, I'm gonna walk right past that stupid grand opening."
"LORELAI: Well, I would take the stationery store, but you're so weird about what kind of pens you like."
"RORY: No, no. I'll just. . .I'll walk really fast. Maybe Taylor won't notice me."
"LORELAI: Yeah. You better walk really fast, like warp speed Mr. Sulu kind of fast."
"RORY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: Twenty minutes!"
"[They go off in separate directions. Rory stops to listen to Taylor speaking to a crowd in front of the soda shop]"
"TAYLOR: …since these and many other flavors await your tongues at Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store. I wanna thank you all for coming here today to help us celebrate our grand opening. Now, originally we were supposed to have our Ice Cream Queen here, but unfortunately, kids, she was just too busy. She just couldn't find time in her busy queen schedule to come play with all of you here today."
"[a young girl in the crowd starts crying]"
"TAYLOR: I know, Christy, but take heart, we still have balloons and music, and as a special treat a little later, a skydiver is going to drop from the sky and land right here in front of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store. Isn't that great, kids? A skydiver who isn't too busy to come play with you will be here soon."
"CUT TO THE BEAUTY SUPPLY STORE"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Kirk."
"KIRK: Hello."
"LORELAI: Hey, I'm looking for a good daytime cream and a good nighttime cream."
"KIRK: For you?"
"LORELAI: No, for Rory."
"KIRK: Is she sensitive, prone to breakouts if the cream is too heavy?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"KIRK: I thought so. Okay, first of all, I would stay far away from that one."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"KIRK: Much too rich for her. This one is light with a fresh citrus scent and it is completely natural."
"LORELAI: We like that."
"KIRK: Now, for day, I would recommend something with a sunscreen. Rory has a classic peaches and cream complexion, and it would be a crime if, when she got older, her face started to look like a cowboy."
"LORELAI: I couldn't agree more."
"KIRK: All right. This should work."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"KIRK: You know, I heard you got back from your trip."
"LORELAI: Yup, I'm living proof."
"KIRK: Miss Patty showed me the castanets you brought her."
"LORELAI: Oh yeah?"
"KIRK: Yeah. And Andrew showed me the T-shirt from the Picasso museum. I must admit, I was a little jealous. I mean, I hate Picasso, but I love T-shirts."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"KIRK: And Pete seemed to really enjoy the Tower of London nutcracker you brought him."
"LORELAI: Kirk."
"KIRK: A nutcracker's a very useful thing to have around. I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting in my living room with a nut thinking, ""if only I had a way to crack this."""
"LORELAI: Okay, Kirk, I'm really sorry, we got a little messed up on the presents. It just got so crazy over there. I mean, we forgot to bring something back for Luke."
"KIRK: I heard he got jam."
"LORELAI: Fake jam."
"KIRK: I love fake jam."
"LORELAI: You know what, I'm gonna make this up to you, okay?"
"KIRK: Really?"
"LORELAI: I promise. We never meant to forget you."
"KIRK: Oh. Okay, well, sure. You can make it up to me."
"LORELAI: Okay. Now how much do I owe you?"
"KIRK: 45.50. You're, uh, you're lucky you came in when you did. I'm closing a little early today."
"LORELAI: Ooh, well, lucky me."
"KIRK: Yup. [he puts on a skydiver's backpack]"
"LORELAI: Kirk, no."
"KIRK: Taylor paid me twenty dollars to jump out of a plane for the grand opening."
"LORELAI: No."
"KIRK: But I took a lesson. The guy said I was a natural at falling."
"LORELAI: Kirk, listen to me, this is the best gift I could possibly give you - don't do that, okay?"
"KIRK: Do I still get the jam?"
"CUT TO OUTSIDE"
"[Rory is walking down the street. Two young kids walk by.]"
"KID 1: Thanks a lot."
"KID 2: Yale can have you."
"[Lorelai walks up to Rory]"
"LORELAI: Honey. Hey, did you get your silly pens?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. Now I can mark these two things off, and we only have about ten thousand other things to do."
"RORY: Great."
"LORELAI: You know, I think the only way we're gonna get this all done is if we prioritize."
"RORY: Meaning?"
"LORELAI: Something has to go."
"RORY: Biscotti night."
"LORELAI: No, not biscotti night. I think we should bail on Friday night dinner."
"RORY: Cancel on Grandma?"
"LORELAI: Yes, cancel on Grandma."
"RORY: I can't do that."
"LORELAI: Rory, we need to get this stuff before tomorrow. There's no way we can do that if we have to drive all the way to Hartford and back. She'll understand. Well, the first part was true."
"RORY: I can't skip dinner."
"LORELAI: Come on, we're gonna go to dinner next week and every week after that for the rest of our lives. And I do mean the rest of our lives because my parents will outlive us. The damned can do that."
"RORY: Mom, I made a deal. This is why I get to go to Yale. I can't back out."
"LORELAI: It's our last night."
"RORY: I have to go. You don't have to, but I do."
"LORELAI: What do you mean I don't have to go?"
"RORY: I was very clear when I made this deal that it was only for me."
"LORELAI: You're right, I don't have to go. Boy, that's an oddly liberating feeling. I don't have to go. I don't have to go. I do not have to go to dinner."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Hang on, I'm not done. I do not have to go ever if I'm not in the mood."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: I'm not going. I'll finish up all the errands."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes. You go and you eat really fast and then get out of there. Meet me back here 9:30, 10 at the latest, and we'll do Godfather I through ""Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,"" and a quick Sofia dying."
"RORY: Deal."
"LORELAI: Remember, eat fast."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Bye."
"[They go off in separate directions. Taylor is still speaking to the crowd in front of the soda shop]"
"TAYLOR: Now just picture her sitting here just like this, smiling and waving. 'Hello kids, I'm the Ice Cream Queen.'"
"[Rory walks up to the microphone to speak to the crowd]"
"RORY: Okay, that's it. I humiliate myself at least six times a year for this town, and just because I'm going to Yale, that's not going to stop. Now the reason I am not the Ice Cream Queen is because Taylor never asked me. I didn't know about it, and that's why I was busy. Now I love this town, I will be back in that ridiculous pilgrim outfit at Thanksgiving, so everybody just get off my back."
"[She walks away as some people applaud]"
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[The doorbell rings. Emily walks toward the door]"
"EMILY: Richard, they're here! Put those papers away and fix your tie."
"[Emily opens the door]"
"RORY: Hey, Grandma."
"EMILY: Hello, Rory."
"RORY: Nice to see you."
"EMILY: It's nice to see you, too. Come on in."
"RORY: I'm sorry I'm a little late."
"EMILY: Well, you're here now and that's all that matters. Shall we go into the living room?"
"RORY: Yes. Then I can give you your present."
"EMILY: My present? Well, that sounds very interesting."
"RORY: We bought it for you in Paris because Mom said you loved Paris the most."
"EMILY: I wonder what it could be."
"[They sit down in the living room. Rory hands her a gift]"
"RORY: For you."
"[Emily opens the gift, an Eiffel Tower figurine]"
"EMILY: Oh my, it's lovely, Rory, really. Just beautiful."
"RORY: It was between this and the Arc de Triumphe, but Mom said that the Eiffel Tower was fancier."
"EMILY: I agree, and I love it. Thank you."
"RORY: You're welcome."
"EMILY: So, where is your mother tonight? Not sick, I hope."
"RORY: Oh, no, she's fine. She just had some things to do."
"EMILY: Ah, things."
"RORY: Errands, actually."
"EMILY: Errands, of course."
"RORY: But she'll be here next week, and she says she's looking forward to it."
"[Richard walks into the room]"
"RICHARD: Emily, I'm expecting a call and there's nothing I can do about it, so please don't be upset when I leave the table. Rory, how lovely to see you. Well, how was the first European excursion?"
"RORY: It was perfect."
"EMILY: Lorelai had chores to do tonight."
"RICHARD: Chores?"
"EMILY: Errands, you know."
"RICHARD: Errands?"
"EMILY: Yes, that's why she didn't come, she had to run errands. But she'll be here next week, and she's looking forward to it. Isn't that nice?"
"RICHARD: I suppose."
"EMILY: I think so, too. Would you like to see my present?"
"RICHARD: Well, that's very nice. That'll fit right in with your collection, Emily."
"EMILY: Yes, it will."
"RORY: We got something for you, too, Grandpa. [hands him a gift]"
"RICHARD: Well, I guess you're not the only one who gets a treat tonight."
"EMILY: Oh, and just when I thought I was special."
"[Richard opens the gift, a pipe]"
"RICHARD: Look at that. That's beautiful."
"RORY: We found this amazing pipe store in Copenhagen and the man there can carve anything you want. His family's been doing it for over a hundred and fifty years. And they had a whole set of Alice in Wonderland pipes that Mom wanted to get, but they were way too expensive so we just got the Queen of Hearts."
"RICHARD: Well, I love it."
"EMILY: Yes, and you're gonna love it outside on the patio."
"RICHARD: As you wish, my dear. [the phone rings] That's my call, that's my call."
"EMILY: Hurry back, or we'll start without you."
"RICHARD: Five minutes. Ten, tops. [leaves room]"
"EMILY: He'll be an hour."
"RORY: Is his new business going well?"
"EMILY: Oh, who knows? He's not in the room long enough to find out."
"MAID: Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: All right, Gerta. Well, I guess we should go in and eat."
"RORY: What about Grandpa?"
"EMILY: Oh, we'll save him something."
"RORY: Okay."
"CUT TO THE DINING ROOM"
"[Emily, Richard, and Rory are eating dinner]"
"RICHARD: So, Rory, tell me, how were the g*n?"
"RORY: The who?"
"RICHARD: The g*n. Our friends in Zurich. The ones we told you two to look up when you got there."
"RORY: Oh, the g*n, right."
"RICHARD: I tell ya, they better have given you a first class welcome. Especially after that son of theirs squatted here for over a month last year."
"EMILY: And ruined the rug in the guest room."
"RICHARD: That's right. Hope you ruined one of their rugs as well."
"RORY: Actually, we, um, we didn't get a chance to see the g*n."
"RICHARD: Hm?"
"EMILY: Why not? Were they out of town?"
"RORY: Well, I -"
"RICHARD: You did go to Zurich, didn't you?"
"RORY: Yes, but, you know, Zurich was so crazy for us that we just figured, 'Ah, we'll just catch 'em next time.'"
"RICHARD: You didn't call them?"
"RORY: You know, there really wasn't time."
"RICHARD: Well, what about the Egerholms in Denmark? Is their new house a monstrosity?"
"RORY: Well, if you think Zurich was hectic, then Denmark was just. . .whoo!"
"RICHARD: You didn't call them?"
"RORY: Um, no."
"RICHARD: The Rezoscos in Florence?"
"RORY: No."
"RICHARD: The Talbots in London?"
"RORY: We were only in London for two days."
"RICHARD: Well, who did you look up when you went to Europe?"
"RORY: Jim Morrison says hello."
"RICHARD: You didn't look up one of our friends? We must've given you fifteen names."
"RORY: I know, but we got so caught up in the backpacking aspect of it that it just kind of slipped our minds."
"RICHARD: You know what that means, Emily. We're going to have to stay with the g*n when we go to Zurich in the fall."
"EMILY: Rory, would you like another piece of chicken?"
"RICHARD: Tiresome people."
"RORY: I've already had two, Grandma."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, why are we friends with them again?"
"EMILY: Well, just take it and nibble at it if you want to. Gerta, you can put the soufflé in now."
"RORY: Soufflé?"
"EMILY: Yes, we're going to have a special dessert, something to celebrate your homecoming."
"RICHARD: Well, why didn't she put it in the oven when we sat down to dinner? Those things take forever to cook."
"EMILY: You know, every time we go to Paris, I marvel at their ability to turn a simple meal into a three or four hour event. Makes every day seem like a party. So tonight, I thought we'd be European. I thought maybe we'd have a cheese plate before dessert and coffee. How does that sound? Bon?"
"RORY: Oh, yes. Very. . .bon."
"EMILY: It's nice to mix it up once in awhile. Oh, I have a wonderful idea. Rory, have you ever seen a ballroom dancing competition?"
"RORY: Uh, no."
"EMILY: You would love it. It is so exciting, and the costumes are beautiful. I've been taping them since 1978. Can you imagine?"
"RORY: No."
"EMILY: All right, then. After dessert, you and I are going to hunker down in that den that we never use and I am pulling out those tapes. We'll just start at the beginning and see how far we get. Perfect, here's the cheese. I'll take that, Gerta. Richard, do you want to start?"
"CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT YARD"
"[Lorelai and Luke are loading Rory's things for Yale into the back of Luke's truck]"
"LUKE: Jeez, you think you go to a fancy school like Yale there'd be a mattress in the room."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Go figure, huh?"
"LUKE: You packed her stuff in Hefty bags?"
"LORELAI: Hey, she's lucky I even had these in the house."
"LUKE: If you needed luggage, you should've asked me."
"LORELAI: You have luggage?"
"LUKE: Yes, I have luggage. Why wouldn't I have luggage?"
"LORELAI: You never go anywhere."
"LUKE: I just went on a seven-country cruise."
"LORELAI: That's right, the mystery cruise that you don't wanna talk about."
"LUKE: I told you I brought luggage. What more info do you need?"
"LORELAI: Why won't you tell me what happened?"
"LUKE: Because."
"LORELAI: Why? Luke, I swear, I'm dying to know, but every time I bring it up, you spaz out. Why won't you tell me? I would tell you."
"LUKE: Yes, but I wouldn't wanna know."
"LORELAI: Did something happen with you and Nicole?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: What? Did you propose?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, you proposed?"
"LUKE: Yes, I proposed."
"LORELAI: This is big. This is huge."
"LUKE: There's more."
"LORELAI: There's more? Okay, well, what? Did she say yes?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: She said yes. You proposed and she said yes. Wow, I -"
"LUKE: There's more."
"LORELAI: And there's more after you proposed and she said yes? What, you -"
"LUKE: We got married."
"LORELAI: You got married? How could you get married?"
"LUKE: We asked the captain and he married us."
"LORELAI: And that's legal?"
"LUKE: Apparently."
"LORELAI: So you're married? You're legally married? This is just -"
"LUKE: Actually, there's a little more."
"LORELAI: And she's pregnant. Oh my God, you finally reproduced."
"LUKE: We're getting divorced."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna sit down now."
"LUKE: It just all happened so fast."
"LORELAI: Well, yeah."
"[they sit down on the front porch steps]"
"LUKE: I mean, you're on this boat in the middle of nowhere and everything's moving and you feel weird all the time. There's this endless supply of food and drink. Uh, midnight buffets, by the way, are the reason the rest of the world hates us. And everyone around us was either in love, engaged, or celebrating their hundredth wedding anniversary, and we were having a good time. . . and there you go."
"LORELAI: There you go."
"LUKE: Of course, the next morning we both woke up and realized we'd lost our minds. We tried to ignore it for awhile, you know, went snorkeling, but by the time we hit land, we were separated, and now we're getting divorced."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, my jet lag and your love life is making me dizzy. Is there more?"
"LUKE: Nope, that's it."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"LUKE: Ah, it's okay."
"LORELAI: Well, look on the bright side. I mean, now that you've been married, it'll silence all those questions."
"LUKE: What questions?"
"LORELAI: You know, a single man of a certain age who lives alone."
"LUKE: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: Hey, I always defended you. I always said, ""Hey, so what if he is?"""
"LUKE: Thank you for your support."
"[Lorelai's cell phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [answers] Hello?"
"RORY: She's taken me hostage."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: She's not letting me leave. Dinner lasted an hour. She didn't even put the soufflé in the oven until we'd already finished, and now we're watching taped ballroom dancing competitions that date back to the 1800's."
"LORELAI: You haven't left yet?"
"RORY: Are you listening to me? I can't leave. She won't let me leave ever. This is Iran in '79 and you are Jimmy Carter. What do we do?"
"LORELAI: Well, first we have to lose the Jimmy Carter comparison, and second, I have to come get you. This is about me and me not showing up, so maybe if I put in an appearance, she'll let you go."
"RORY: Okay, but come quickly because she's got a lot of tapes and they rewind really slow."
"LORELAI: I'm on my way. [hangs up] Um, hey, so, uh, I have to go get Rory."
"LUKE: Everything okay?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah. You know, my mother's a psycho, so. . .business as usual."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Thanks for the help."
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: And I am sorry."
"LUKE: I'll be fine."
"[Kirk walks by in a skydiver's outfit, trailing a parachute behind him]"
"KIRK: Strong wind."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[In the den, Emily puts a ballroom dancing tape into the VCR, then sits next to Rory on the couch]"
"EMILY: Now I think you're really going to see quite a difference from the early eighties. They really start to mix it up in '88."
"RORY: Mmhmm."
"EMILY: Oh, see right there, see that move? Five years ago it was not allowed. Could've gotten you kicked right out."
"RORY: That's harsh."
"EMILY: Oh, yes. Ballroom dancing can be very harsh. Oh, look. The couple in the purple feathers - that's Corky and Shirley Ballas. I love them, they are so talented. Corky's actually writing a musical based on their life as ballroom champions, and their son, Corky Jr., is going to play him as a young man."
"RORY: Wow. Two Corky's in one show. Don't see that everyday."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY: Mom, hi!"
"LORELAI: There you guys are."
"EMILY: What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Well, you know, it's funny, I just happen to be in the neighborhood and I thought to myself, I wonder what's doing at the Gilmore house."
"RORY: We're watching National Ballroom Dancing competitions."
"LORELAI: You are? Well, that sounds fun. Mind if I watch with you?"
"EMILY: I don't think you'd enjoy it."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I'm sure I would."
"EMILY: Well, you've already missed the beginning."
"LORELAI: I'm betting you could catch me up."
"EMILY: Rory, would you go ask Gerta if she would make me some tea?"
"RORY: Uh, sure, Grandma. [leaves]"
"LORELAI: No, nothing for me, Mom. Thanks. Um, so what's new?"
"EMILY: Well, you obviously weren't just in the neighborhood, so why don't you tell me what you're doing here?"
"LORELAI: Uh, you know, I came to see you."
"EMILY: You came to get Rory."
"LORELAI: Mom, she's been here for hours. Patty Hearst had a shorter incarceration."
"EMILY: She's not being held hostage, Lorelai. I resent that. She's spending time with me, something you obviously don't want to do."
"LORELAI: Mom, I'm sorry I missed dinner tonight."
"EMILY: Come to dinner, don't come to dinner, it makes no difference to me. You are under no obligation to us any longer."
"LORELAI: I know, but -"
"EMILY: You're very busy, I understand. I wouldn't wanna keep you any longer."
"LORELAI: Mom, please, let me take Rory with me."
"EMILY: No. Tonight is my night with Rory."
"LORELAI: You're keeping her from me on purpose."
"EMILY: If Rory wants to leave, she can ask to leave. She's not a four-year old."
"LORELAI: Well, she's not gonna hurt your feelings by asking to leave."
"EMILY: Why should she? She knows you'll be along any second to do it for her."
"LORELAI: Mom, why do you always make everything so hard? Don't you understand, this is my last night with my daughter! She goes off to college tomorrow!"
"EMILY: I know, which is why I was so surprised you didn't want to spend the evening with her."
"LORELAI: I do!"
"EMILY: Then you should've come!"
"LORELAI: I couldn't!"
"EMILY: You wouldn't!"
"LORELAI: Ugh, I swear to God! Where's Dad?"
"EMILY: Oh, he went to bed hours ago."
"LORELAI: He went to bed?"
"EMILY: Well, it was getting late."
"[Lorelai laughs a little]"
"EMILY: Why are you laughing?"
"LORELAI: Um, you know, you've got Rory locked in here with the Mambo Kings, and, um, and Dad went to bed."
"EMILY: So what? Why is that funny?"
"LORELAI: Because. . .you know, she's here and he's there and. . .God, I'm so tired."
"[Lorelai keeps laughing. Rory walks in]"
"RORY: What's so funny?"
"EMILY: Oh, she's having a fit."
"RORY: Mom?"
"LORELAI: Oh my God. [laughs harder]"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: I just got the Jimmy Carter reference."
"[Lorelai and Rory laugh]"
"EMILY: As soon as you're both done. . ."
"CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE"
"[Later that night, Lorelai and Rory are watching ballroom dancing in the den]"
"RORY: Oh, watch this. This part's really good."
"LORELAI: Ouch, that has got to hurt."
"RORY: Cool, huh?"
"LORELAI: Extremely. Plus, the whole matching haircut thing adds a level of commitment to their act that the other acts just lack. Oh, hey, careful where you put the hand there, mister."
"RORY: You know they rehearse every night, plus they have classes, plus they go to the gym four times a week?"
"LORELAI: Hm. Oh my God, she's balancing on his hand. He is like Superman. Or Wonder Woman. Either way, he's very strong."
"RORY: So, tomorrow. . ."
"LORELAI: Yeah, tomorrow."
"RORY: It's a big day."
"LORELAI: It's a really big day."
"RORY: I just hope it's everything I've been imagining it to be."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I just hope you actually get there."
"[they glance at Emily sleeping on the other couch, then continue watching the television]"
"LORELAI: You know, if Sofia could just die during a fox trot, that would be perfect."
"RORY: Biscotti?"
"LORELAI: Yes, please."
"[Rory hands her one from the bag]"
"LORELAI: They're all broken."
"RORY: I know. I like 'em that way."

"OPEN AT LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Rory walks out of her bedroom with some beauty products. She goes into the living room to pack them in a suitcase]"
"RORY: I've got too much stuff."
"LORELAI: [calls from upstairs] What?"
"RORY: Stuff! And it's your fault. You inculcated into me a tolerance for rampant consumerism."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: When did I become one of those girls with dozens of beauty products, none of which are expendable? It used to be a touch of mascara, dab of Coppertone, zip, bam, boom, out the door."
"LORELAI: I heard copper and boom."
"RORY: Never mind. And what's going on? We're late."
"LORELAI: I'm looking for the camera."
"RORY: Oy vey, she's looking for the camera."
"LORELAI: I heard that."
"RORY: That she hears."
"[Lorelai comes down the steps]"
"LORELAI: It is my prerogative as your mother to record any event in my daughter's life that I so choose. It's in the mother's handbook."
"RORY: Does Luke know that you can't drive a stick?"
"LORELAI: Why?"
"RORY: Because you borrowed his truck and it's a stick."
"LORELAI: I can drive a stick."
"RORY: You can stir coffee with a stick, but you can't drive a stick."
"LORELAI: Okay, I am glad I did not choose to record that particular moment in my daughter's life 'cause that was just ugly."
"RORY: I just want you to get there in one piece."
"LORELAI: You look out for me."
"RORY: Let's hit the road."
"LORELAI: Oh, wait, wait, this is it! This is the precise moment that I've been looking for. This is my daughter going off to college, this is my sh*t!"
"RORY: Okay, fine."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm lining you up, now look candid."
"RORY: Okay, see, the very definition of candid means that the subject doesn't know the picture's being taken."
"LORELAI: So forget the camera's there."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: And smile."
"RORY: Okay, okay."
"[Lorelai takes a picture]"
"LORELAI: I'm not happy."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: It looks posed."
"RORY: How about this?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, you know the stick we were talking about before? It looks like it's somewhere else now."
"RORY: You're having serious Annie Leibovitz delusions here."
"LORELAI: But it just looks like you're standing in the house. No one will know that you're going off to college."
"RORY: Shall I hold a sign?"
"LORELAI: Or you could do the ""going off to college"" walk."
"RORY: The what?"
"LORELAI: The walk, the this. [imitates the walk]"
"RORY: You look like Alfalfa coming to pick up Darla."
"LORELAI: Here, hold some of your stuff. At least it'll look like you're moving or something."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Ugh, it looks like you're taking out the trash."
"RORY: Okay, that's it, we're going."
"LORELAI: All right. I'll just have to make do with one of the pictures I already took."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: Ooh, I'll put it on the computer and then superimpose an important person standing next to you seeing you off, like Kissinger or Lady Bird Johnson or Pat Summerall or something."
"RORY: Pat Summerall?"
"LORELAI: Well, you think of somebody better."
"RORY: Orson Welles."
"LORELAI: It can't be a dead person."
"RORY: Pat Summerall's dead."
"LORELAI: No, he's not."
"RORY: Pat Summerall is dead."
"LORELAI: No, I'm telling you, he's not. Lady Bird Johnson is dead."
"RORY: No, she's not."
"LORELAI: How much you wanna bet?"
"RORY: Five bucks."
"LORELAI: Let's google him right now."
"RORY: Mom, Yale?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, Yale can wait for us to google Pat Summerall."
"RORY: Come."
"LORELAI: Where are your priorities?"
"[opening credits]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Rory walks in and sits at the counter]"
"RORY: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Hey, Rory. Isn't today Yale?"
"RORY: Um, yeah, I'm going right now."
"LUKE: You look so calm. How do you feel?"
"RORY: A little nervous, but a last Luke's fix before I go will help."
"LUKE: Well, today is whatever you want on the house."
"RORY: Wow, I feel important."
"LUKE: You are important. Where's your mom?"
"RORY: She's coming. She's having a wee bit of trouble with your truck."
"[Luke looks out the window and sees Lorelai backing his truck toward the diner]"
"LUKE: What is she doing?"
"RORY: Well, she, uh, backed the truck out of our driveway all fine and everything, but once she hit the road, she couldn't get it out of reverse, so she -"
"LUKE: Backed it here?"
"RORY: Slow but steady."
"[Luke walks outside to the truck]"
"LORELAI: Something's wrong with your truck."
"LUKE: Nothing's wrong with my truck. Stop the truck."
"LORELAI: It won't go out of reverse."
"LUKE: You can't drive a stick."
"LORELAI: I can't drive an uncooperative stick."
"LUKE: My stick's not uncooperative. Come on, hit the brakes."
"[Lorelai stops the truck and gets out. Luke gets in]"
"LORELAI: Okay, good luck. I don't think it's gonna happen."
"[Luke drives the truck forward and parks it along the curb]"
"LORELAI: This is a misogynistic truck!"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's anti-woman, it's gender-selective, it's ""Oh, let's drink a beer and watch the game and hike our shorts up."""
"[Luke gets out of the truck and they start walking toward the diner]"
"LUKE: I changed my mind, you can't borrow my truck."
"LORELAI: But it's full of our stuff."
"LUKE: You should've hired movers."
"LORELAI: You could've said no when I asked to borrow the truck."
"LUKE: You said you could drive a stick."
"LORELAI: Yeah, not the Joe Sixpack of sticks. Not the ""Oh, let's scratch our bellies and eat some corn nuts and pick our teeth."""
"[they walk into the diner]"
"LORELAI: Really, Luke, I can drive it."
"LUKE: Okay, fine. Just be careful and have it back by four."
"LORELAI: Four-ish it is."
"LUKE: Four, I need it at four."
"LORELAI:: Give or take a few min-"
"LUKE: Four."
"LORELAI:: God, he's so possessive about the stupid truck."
"LUKE: It's my truck, I possess it!"
"LORELAI:: I'm just kidding. I'll have it back by four, calm down."
"LUKE: Okay, I'm just. . .I'm not in much of a kidding mood with all this other stuff going on. Divorce papers. Fun, huh?"
"LORELAI: Zero fun. Sorry, Luke."
"LUKE: It's not that I wasn't expecting them, it's just. . .the law firm that Nicole works for sent them. I called with a simple question they could've answered over the phone, but they insisted on sending someone down to see me."
"LORELAI: I take it you're not looking forward to that."
"LUKE: I'm about to build a moat of fire."
"CAESAR: Here you go, Rory. [hands her a bag]"
"RORY: Thanks, Caesar. Since we were short on time, I had them make us something to go. My Yale special."
"LORELAI: Oh, share, share."
"RORY: Sausage wrapped in a pancake tied together with bacon."
"LORELAI: You made that up?"
"RORY: I don't know how I do it."
"LUKE: Here. [shows Lorelai a piece of paper]"
"LORELAI: What's this?"
"LUKE: A shift diagram for the truck, nice and simple. D is for drive, R is for -"
"LORELAI: The R in drive!"
"LUKE: R is for reverse."
"LORELAI: Right, reverse."
"LUKE: And one is -"
"LORELAI: The loneliest number that you'll ever know!"
"LUKE: The first gear."
"LORELAI: I know, Luke. Really, I can handle it."
"LUKE: I hope so."
"RORY: Thanks, Luke."
"LUKE: Good luck, Rory. [sees a man enter the diner] Oh, goody, a guy in a suit."
"LORELAI: Good luck to you."
"[Lorelai and Rory leave; the man walks up to Luke]"
"RUSSELL:"
"MR. Danes?"
"LUKE: Unfortunately."
"RUSSELL: I'm Russell Bynes. I'm with Blodgett, Sage, Albet, Pettruccio, Stein, Lemming, and Stein, attorneys for Nicole Diana Leahy."
"LUKE: And the sun just went down, thanks for coming."
"RUSSELL: Pardon me?"
"LUKE: You're wasting your time. I had a simple question, where do I sign? It didn't require a personal visit."
"RUSSELL: Whoa, whoa, there's no place to sign because this is just a document informing the defendant of the type of action being filed."
"LUKE: What are you talking about? Who's the defendant?"
"RUSSELL: You are."
"LUKE: Oh my God."
"RUSSELL: Didn't you read the papers?"
"LUKE: Yeah, the Red Sox lost by three, Bush is at the ranch chatting up a Swiss dude."
"RUSSELL: The divorce papers."
"LUKE: I know what you meant. Look, I didn't k*ll anyone. Nicole and I just kind of accidentally got married and now we want out. We both want the same thing."
"RUSSELL: Don't try to play me,"
"MR. Danes."
"LUKE: I'm too busy for this."
"RUSSELL: Fine, because I should just be dealing with your legal representation."
"LUKE: I don't believe this."
"RUSSELL: Not giving us your lawyer's information is only going to prolong the process."
"LUKE: Okay, if I give you my lawyer's name, will you leave?"
"RUSSELL: I will leave."
"LUKE: Okay, you ready?"
"RUSSELL: Yes."
"LUKE: His name is Don Dewey. He works at the firm of Dewey. . ."
"RUSSELL: Dewey."
"LUKE: Cheatham. . ."
"RUSSELL: Cheatham."
"LUKE: And Howe."
"RUSSELL: Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe. That was very immature."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, tickled me."
"RUSSELL: My bosses are gonna wanna hear this."
"LUKE: Oh, come on, they've heard that one before. Oh, hey, if you want Don's number, it's 555-5555."
"[Russell leaves. Lorelai walks back in holding out the stick shift diagram]"
"LUKE: I thought you were gone."
"LORELAI: Nothing's where it says it is."
"[Luke flips the paper over]"
"LORELAI: It's gonna be fine."
"CUT TO YALE UNIVERSITY"
"[Lorelai is standing in a parking space in the street in front of the school. Rory pulls up in her car]"
"RORY: Nice score!"
"LORELAI: Thank you. Oh, and later, I'll, uh, point out the seven or so fellow Yalies who already hate you because your obnoxious mother wouldn't let them park in the only open spot left."
"RORY: Oh, goody. You get the truck here okay?"
"LORELAI: Oh, we had some bickering, but we made it."
"[a girl walks over to them]"
"TESS: Hello. Name?"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey. I was told it was okay to hold the spot. A guy told me, I forget his name. He had, uh, like, a jacket."
"TESS: It's okay. I was just wondering what our newcomer's name is."
"RORY: Rory Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Right, Rory Gilmore"
"TESS: [checks list] Rory Gilmore, Rory Gilmore. . . there you are. Welcome to Yale."
"LORELAI: Oh, hold the shake, hold the shake."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Wait, lens cap, lens cap."
"RORY: Sorry."
"TESS: They all do this."
"LORELAI: Shake. [takes picture] Got it. Who are you?"
"TESS: I'm Tess, I'm Rory's freshman counselor. I'll be living in the building and be there for whatever she needs."
"LORELAI: And you look twenty-one, convenient for beer runs."
"TESS: I'll be giving a tour for Durfee girls you should not miss."
"RORY: Oh, I know. Tour's at twelve, followed by the optional express lunch twelve to two, which is all followed by the telecommunications orientation and internet ID distribution, parents' reception eleven to one."
"TESS: You memorized the schedule."
"LORELAI: Yeah, she's not weird or anything, she just has a good memory."
"TESS: And I see you brought your own mattress."
"LORELAI: Oh, right. See, the guy. . .name, name, name. I forget his name. Three syllables. Uh, he said it was okay, and he had, like, a mustache."
"TESS: It's allowed as long as you make arrangements to dispose of the one that was already there. Did you do that?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we did."
"RORY: Yes."
"TESS: Good. Get your camera ready."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"TESS: I'm giving Rory her key."
"LORELAI: Thanks for the warning. [takes picture]"
"TESS: See you at the tour."
"RORY: Yes, Tess, thank you."
"[Tess walks away]"
"RORY: So, she's nice."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I'm dying to see your room. Come on, grab a bag."
"RORY: So, you made arrangements to get rid of the old mattress?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I did."
"RORY: Really?"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk in]"
"RORY: Because it specifically says here that you're supposed to make arrangements to have the old mattress picked up before arrival."
"LORELAI: Ooh, very grand."
"RORY: So, what time are the mattress guys coming?"
"LORELAI: Uh, later today sometime."
"RORY: So we have to wait in the room for them, or. . ."
"LORELAI: I think they just let themselves in. Here we are."
"RORY: So do the mattress guys have their own key?"
"LORELAI: All right, I confess, I didn't call the mattress guys."
"RORY: Well, what are we gonna do?"
"LORELAI: We'll find a dumpster."
"RORY: Mom, they could trace it back to me."
"LORELAI: I'll be long gone by then."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: All right, we'll burn it before we dump it. A match, a little gasoline."
"RORY: We're here five minutes and we're already contemplating felonies."
"[Lorelai unlocks Rory's dorm suite and they walk inside]"
"LORELAI: Just like I pictured it."
"RORY: Did you see an emergency exit?"
"LORELAI: A fireplace, too! I wonder if it's woodburning."
"RORY: It says here, ""Upon arrival, please take note of the emergency exits."""
"LORELAI: Hey, hey, we could burn the mattress in there, save us a trip."
"RORY: Aw, man, a piece of my map ripped off."
"LORELAI: Which one's your room?"
"RORY: I'm missing half of the Old Campus."
"LORELAI: R.G. This is it."
"RORY: If I have Old Campus activities today, I'm screwed."
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Here it is. Here's where you're going to be thinking all those impressive thoughts. It's just waiting for your decorative stamp. And a little air freshener."
"RORY: Where's the phone jack?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, Jack. Where is the pesky phone?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: You're one-note Nancy today."
"RORY: Ah, here's a place to get replacement maps. Aw, holy cow, it's in Old Campus!"
"LORELAI: All right, that's it."
"RORY: Hey, what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: You just missed it."
"RORY: Missed what?"
"LORELAI: Walking into your dorm suite for the first time. Do over."
"[Lorelai leads Rory back out to the hallway]"
"RORY: What? We're short on time here and we haven't unloaded."
"LORELAI: It doesn't matter. You're gonna be in the moment."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: You're gonna be in the moment or the rest of the map gets it."
"RORY: No. Okay, I'm here, I swear."
"LORELAI: You're not placating me?"
"RORY: I'll try. Really, I'm all here."
"LORELAI: Good. Oh, here's your suite."
"RORY: Cool."
"[they walk inside]"
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Huh?"
"RORY: It is cool. My own space."
"LORELAI: Well, yours and P.G.'s and J.B.'s and T.S.'s."
"RORY: And a fireplace. Did you see the fireplace?"
"LORELAI: Was this do over justified or what?"
"[they walk into Rory's bedroom]"
"RORY: You mentioned thoughts in here?"
"LORELAI: Mm, all the great ones you're gonna have."
"RORY: And air freshener?"
"LORELAI: That, too."
"RORY: Thanks for putting me in the moment."
"LORELAI: My pleasure."
"RORY: It's something I would have not wanted to miss."
"LORELAI: Good. And thank you."
"RORY: For what?"
"LORELAI: For pretending that you're not at this moment thinking about missing your tour, finding your phone jack, navigating the Old Campus."
"RORY: It's my gift to you."
"LORELAI: Let's go unload and get you a new map."
"RORY: Bless you."
"CUT TO YALE COURTYARD"
"[Rory is in her freshman orientation tour]"
"TESS: Just keep in mind, guys, the dining hall hours are cast in stone - you snooze, you lose. And it's a post-9/11 world, so your ID's are important. You'll be asked for it a lot, so always have it, always, always. It also operates the laundry machines and is also your meal card. That's right, it's practically magic, so don't lose it."
"[Another tour group walks by]"
"TOUR GUIDE: If you're stupid enough to get ripped, I'm here to help, but I do not hold buckets, if you get my drift. Now, pay attention to street parking, it is severely restricted in most places. Walk or take the shuttle when you can."
"TESS: First floor Durfee."
"TOUR GUIDE: Third floor Bingham."
"TESS: They're babies."
"TOUR GUIDE: Tots. Third floor Bingham, through the gate, make a left."
"TESS: Get an internet ID whether you think you'll use it or not. It'll be your name at yale.edu, and there's no changing what you get."
"GIRL: Think there's gonna be a test?"
"RORY: Probably not. Oh, you were joking. Good one."
"TESS: No bottlenecks, girls. There's about a hundred behind you waiting for the same stuff. Do not get precious about your ID pictures. They are what they are."
"GIRL: Did you get that down? They are what they are."
"RORY: I'll remember."
"PHOTO GUY: Next!"
"GIRL: That would be you."
"RORY: What?"
"PHOTO GUY: It's picture time."
"RORY: Oh, sorry. [sits down to get her picture taken] I didn't think pictures were today. Do you mind if I take a second to -"
"PHOTO GUY: One thousand and one. [takes picture] Next!"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory's tour group walks into the dorm]"
"TESS: Always have your keys. Never open the door to someone you don't know. Walk in twos at night. That's it, any questions? Later on, you'll have questions. I'll be around. Now go do stuff."
"[Rory walks into her suite. A girl follows her in and sits down in the common room. Rory goes into her bedroom, then peeks out at the girl. Lorelai enters the suite.]"
"LORELAI: Rory, you back?"
"[Lorelai goes into Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: Who is that?"
"RORY: I don't know. She just followed me in here like a puppy dog without saying a word."
"LORELAI: Maybe she's lost."
"RORY: Or maybe she's one of my new suitemates who I'm already off to a swell start with."
"LORELAI: Do you know how vulnerable you are to venereal disease?"
"RORY: All hail to the queen of the non-sequiturs."
"LORELAI: This parent orientation I went to was a nonstop litany of the horrors awaiting college freshman. You're supposed to carry a whistle, a flashlight, a crucifix, and a loaded Glock with you at all times."
"RORY: We should go out there. She'll think we're hiding."
"LORELAI: Okay, just don't shake hands with her. Bacteria."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Or tell her where you live."
"RORY: Too late."
"LORELAI: Oh, you touched the doorknob."
"RORY: Good grief."
"[they open the door]"
"LORELAI: Say something."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Anything. Go, go."
"[they walk out into the common room]"
"RORY: Hi."
"TANNA: Hi. [pause] I'm adopted."
"RORY: You're up."
"LORELAI: What's your name?"
"TANNA: Tanna Schrick."
"LORELAI: Well, Tanna Schrick, good. We're making some progress. Hi, Tanna Schrick. I'm Lorelai, this is Rory. She'll be living here, too."
"RORY: We're suitemates."
"TANNA: As they're ransacking your room, professional thieves typically start at the bottom drawer and work their way up. That way they don't have to close drawers before opening the next one. Saves time."
"LORELAI: Okay. So, no storing your valuables in the bottom drawer. Got that, Rory? Good tip, Tanna. Thanks."
"TANNA: I'm not so great at extemporaneous speaking, so I've memorized some quick conversational facts I can whip out at a moment's notice. Oh, when I get to know you better, I'll memorize some facts that are more specific to your person."
"LORELAI: Tanna, how old are you?"
"TANNA: Sixteen."
"RORY: Sixteen?"
"TANNA: On Tuesday."
"LORELAI: Happy birthday, Doogie."
"TANNA: Thank you."
"LORELAI: And, uh, where are your parents?"
"TANNA: Oh, at the hotel. Mom's napping, Dad's getting a schvitz."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, we still have some more stuff to do, but maybe your parents will be here when I get back. I'd love to meet them."
"TANNA: Yeah, well, they make a very good first impression."
"LORELAI: I'm sure they do. See you later, kiddo."
"RORY: Bye."
"TANNA: Oh, hey, um, Rory?"
"RORY: Yeah?"
"TANNA: You nervous?"
"RORY: Oh yeah."
"TANNA: Okay, good."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out to the hallway]"
"LORELAI: Odd, but nice."
"RORY: I'll take it."
"LORELAI: So. . .this is it."
"RORY: This is it."
"LORELAI: Learn a lot of stuff."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: And, uh, you know, keep in touch."
"RORY: Well, we'll at least exchange Christmas cards."
"LORELAI: With a letter detailing what's happened over the year."
"RORY: And a current photo."
"LORELAI: Don't joke!"
"RORY: You started it."
"LORELAI: I was masking my pain."
"RORY: You'll see plenty of me."
"LORELAI: It's not enough."
"RORY: How about tons?"
"LORELAI: That's better. I love you, did you know that?"
"RORY: I always suspected it."
"[as they hug, someone bumps into them with a box]"
"LORELAI: Oh, excuse me. A little fridge."
"RORY: It's"
"CUTe."
"LORELAI: I want one."
"RORY: Well, go get yourself one."
"LORELAI: For you, I want one for you."
"RORY: I don't need one."
"LORELAI: For sodas and stuff when things are closed. Late night cram sessions."
"RORY: I guess it would come in handy."
"LORELAI: Oh, let's see what these people have going on. [peeks into a room]"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: A rug! A rug for your room to make it cozy. And a vase of flowers."
"RORY: Well, the flowers will just die."
"LORELAI: They have a vase of the most beautiful fake flowers I've ever seen. Trash cans!"
"RORY: Oh, you're right."
"LORELAI: And a fan. I have been remiss."
"RORY: No, you haven't."
"LORELAI: I have got another trip to make today."
"RORY: No, Mom, you've done enough today."
"LORELAI: I want you fully outfitted and settled for your first night or I won't sleep."
"RORY: We can get it all later."
"LORELAI: No, no. Now go unpack the skimpy amount of stuff I've gotten you so far and I'll be back in a couple of hours. Copper boom."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: It's what you said to me this morning when you were trying to speed me up."
"RORY: But you missed a bunch of stuff in between."
"LORELAI: I think it's catchy. Go, go, unpack."
"RORY: Copper boom!"
"LORELAI: Copper boom!"
"[They walk off in separate directions. Lorelai passes a guy carrying a container of stuff and she looks in it to see what he brought.]"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Copper boom!"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke. [sees three lawyers sitting at a table] Oops."
"LUKE: sh**t me."
"LORELAI: Now, or maybe later so you're surprised?"
"[Luke walks over to the table of lawyers]"
"MR. STEIN 1:"
"MR. Danes, a marriage contract is a contract just like any other."
"MR. STEIN 2: As the higher wage earner, Nicole wants a fair settlement."
"LUKE: But I want nothing from her, so there's nothing to settle,"
"MR. . . what's your name again?"
"MR. STEIN 1: My name is Stein."
"LUKE: I thought you were Stein."
"MR. STEIN 2: I'm Stein as well."
"LUKE: Well, then I'm confused."
"MR. BLODGETT:"
"MR. Danes, I'm an impatient man, I'm a busy man, I'm a sensible man, I'm a skeptical man."
"LUKE: Oh, you're four different men, huh? Well, are they all named Stein, too?"
"MR. BLODGETT: If there's one thing I've learned in this business, it's that no one wants nothing."
"MR. STEIN 2: Why won't you hire a lawyer?"
"LUKE: Why? Because lawyers waste time and money. They're needless middlemen who slither into people's lives when they're at their most vulnerable so they can clamp on and suck like leeches until everyone but them is distraught and penniless."
"MR. STEIN 1: Well, I can see why the marriage went bad."
"MR. BLODGETT: Here's fair warning,"
"MR. Danes - if you don't hire a lawyer, you could wind up getting absolutely nothing."
"LUKE: That's what I want!"
"MR. STEIN 1: There he goes again."
"MR. STEIN 2: Maybe we should get Sage and Albet into this."
"MR. STEIN 1: Hm. Pettruccio, too."
"[Luke walks over to Lorelai at the counter]"
"LUKE: They're gonna multiply like the matrix."
"LORELAI: Oh, well. . ."
"[Luke brings Lorelai over to the lawyers]"
"LUKE: Tell them, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Huh? Tell them what?"
"MR. BLODGETT: Who's this?"
"LUKE: This is Lorelai."
"MR. STEIN 1: Are you an attorney?"
"LUKE: No, she's carbon-based."
"MR. STEIN 2: And what's her role?"
"LUKE: Uh, be my character witness or something."
"LORELAI: Right, okay. Well, I can vouch for this man. I mean, I know he cared for Nicole, and apparently they both got a little rash. I mean, not in 'apply to affected area twice daily' rash, I mean rash in that they hastily entered into a union."
"MR. BLODGETT: We know all this."
"LORELAI: But if you think he married her to get something, I know that's not true. He's basically a hermit, and happy to be one. I could show you his place upstairs. I mean, you half expect Hari Krishnas to jump out of the bathroom banging tambourines. All he likes is fishing and watching baseball, and he's got a reel and he's got a TV, so he's all set. So when he says he wants nothing, I know he means it, because when I think of Luke Danes, I think nothing."
"LUKE:"
"MR. Blodgett, Steins one and two, there you go."
"MR. STEIN 1: Your choice of character witness does nothing to allay our concerns."
"LORELAI: Sorry. [goes back to the counter]"
"MR. BLODGETT: The bottom line, time. If we do not receive a response in this matter, we're just going to have to kick this up a notch."
"LUKE: Okay, there is something I want, but I've been holding back."
"MR. BLODGETT: As we suspected."
"MR. STEIN 2: Let's hear it."
"LUKE: Okay, you know Nicole and I went on a cruise, right?"
"MR. STEIN 2: Oh boy."
"MR. STEIN 1: Oh yeah."
"LUKE: Well, the first night on the boat we, uh, went to see an act that everyone was raving about. We go in, sit down, they close the door. Turned out to be a guy playing musical drinking glasses. You know, with the half-filled cups that give off different tones. He played Mozart, and I swear I could hear Mozart banging on his coffin. Out of politeness, we stayed, and there went an hour of our lives. Next night, the sign in front of the theater said the entertainment for the night was a guy singing the songs of Sinatra. We verified with the guy at the door, the songs of Frank Sinatra, right? Not Tina, not Frank Jr., not Bill Sinatra, but Ol' Blue Eyes. ""Yes,"" he says. ""It's like Frank come to life."" We go in, sit down, they close the door. Then they announce that the guy singing Sinatra is sick and the glass-playing guy is filling in. Out he comes, there's goes another hour. Next night, we meet a nice couple while walking the Lido Deck. Had some nice conversation, so we have dinner with th"
"MR. BLODGETT: We'll have to confer on this."
"MR. STEIN 1: Maybe do a productivity study."
"LUKE: Yeah, get Blobb, Fromm and Pinnuccio in there, too."
"MR. BLODGETT: We'll get back to you."
"LUKE: I have no doubt."
"[the lawyers leave. Luke sits next to Lorelai at the counter]"
"LORELAI: Wow."
"LUKE: I'm exhausted."
"LORELAI: Sorry I barged in like that."
"LUKE: Trust me, the interruption was welcome."
"LORELAI: So, did you check the clock? It's not yet four."
"LUKE: Rory safe and sound?"
"LORELAI: Safe and sound."
"LUKE: And the truck?"
"LORELAI: Well. . ."
"LUKE: You wrecked it."
"LORELAI: It's not wrecked."
"LUKE: I don't see it."
"LORELAI: It's around the corner."
"LUKE: You wrecked it."
"LORELAI: No, but I need to use it awhile longer."
"LUKE: Because you wrecked it and it's in the shop."
"LORELAI: You really can't afford to alienate your chief character witness."
"[they walk outside to the truck]"
"LUKE: It's full of stuff."
"LORELAI: I know."
"LUKE: Why didn't you unload it?"
"LORELAI: I did, this is my second load."
"LUKE: You didn't say anything about a second load."
"LORELAI: I didn't know I had to have one 'til I realized what a piker of a mother I'd been compared to the other kids' moms."
"LUKE: It's still running."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, turns out that ignition key is just as misogynistic as that stick shift of yours."
"LUKE: You just have to jiggle it a little."
"LORELAI: You didn't mention any jiggling."
"LUKE: It's common sense."
"LORELAI: Oh, that."
"LUKE: Wait, why is the mattress still there?"
"LORELAI: Oh, that's not the mattress, that's a mattress."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Rory has the new mattress. That's the Yale-supplied mattress that has microbes in it that date back to Henry Box Brown."
"LUKE: Well, what are you gonna do with it?"
"LORELAI: Well, I was thinking maybe you could store it for me."
"LUKE: Uh, no."
"LORELAI: Come on."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Well, I can't take it back to Yale."
"LUKE: I'm not storing your microbe mattress, forget it."
"LORELAI: Well, then I'm stuck here."
"LUKE: Fine, because I need my truck back."
"LORELAI: Fine, but that leaves you with the mattress."
"LUKE: I'm not taking the mattress."
"LORELAI: Then let me take the truck."
"LUKE: But that means you take the mattress."
"LORELAI: I can't take the mattress."
"LUKE: Then you can't have the truck."
"LORELAI: But that sticks you with the mattress."
"LUKE: If you take the truck, it comes with the mattress."
"LORELAI: I can't take the mattress."
"LUKE: Then you can't have the truck."
"LORELAI: And that sticks you with the mattress."
"LUKE: We've been here before."
"LORELAI: I recognize that tree."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is in her bedroom unpacking. There's a knock at the door]"
"RORY: Come on in."
"[Tanna walks in]"
"TANNA: Um, another suitemate has arrived."
"RORY: Oh yeah?"
"TANNA: Yeah. She's a little weird. Um, I've already forgotten her name. I'm a disaster with names."
"RORY: That's okay."
"TANNA: It's the name of a city, like Athens or Rome or something."
"PARIS: [from the common room] I'm sure things can be rearranged. I mean, why not? It's a dorm, you're supposed to."
"TERRENCE: Let it go."
"[Rory and Tanna walk out to the common room]"
"RORY: Paris?"
"TANNA: Yeah, that's it."
"PARIS: How shocked are you?"
"RORY: Do you have a resuscitator?"
"PARIS: I'm going to Yale."
"RORY: You're going to Yale."
"PARIS: And we're suitemates."
"RORY: Of all the gin joints."
"PARIS: Give me a hug! Wait. Give me a hug!"
"RORY: This is a massively big surprise."
"PARIS: I was gonna call and then I thought, hey, let's wait and just be right in her face."
"RORY: I can't even feel my face anymore."
"PARIS: This is a good thing."
"RORY: No, yes, it's definitely a good thing. It's just, again, my nose. . .it feels like clay."
"PARIS: Oh, uh, this is Terrence."
"RORY: Hello."
"TERRENCE: It's nice to finally meet you, Rory."
"PARIS: Terrence is my life coach."
"RORY: Your what?"
"PARIS: Don't judge."
"RORY: I'm not."
"PARIS: Remember my nanny? I lost her over the summer."
"RORY: I'm sorry, what happened?"
"PARIS: She opened a pupuseria in Boise."
"RORY: So she's okay?"
"PARIS: Yeah, but I was pretty lost. Then my rabbi conferred with my therapist who said a hypnotist he knew thought a life coach would be right for me, and that led me to Terrence. He's here to assist me with whatever I need assistance in, from wardrobe to diet to finding me a kick-ass gynecologist."
"RORY: That's great, Paris, really."
"PARIS: He's done so much for my people k*ll. I can cope with the little annoyances now. [to Tanna] For instance, the old Paris would've been bothered by your penchant to hover. It would've made her wanna ring your neck until your eyeballs popped out."
"TANNA: Oh."
"PARIS: But now, I accept it because I can't control everything. Paris Gellar."
"RORY: That's Tanna."
"TANNA: In medieval times, surnames often reflected a person's origin or occupation so they were descriptive as well as utilitarian."
"PARIS: And what does Tanna mean?"
"TANNA: Nothing."
"PARIS: We're gonna have some fun this year."
"TANNA: Thank you."
"PARIS: How's your face?"
"RORY: Better, thanks."
"PARIS: Is that my room?"
"RORY: If your initials are P.G., it is."
"[Paris checks the room out]"
"PARIS: Terrence, I got my southern exposure."
"TERRENCE: I'm a happy camper."
"RORY: So, weird, weird coincidence that we're roommates like this, huh?"
"PARIS: Not really. I told Terrence all about our history and he felt very strongly that our life journey was not complete, so my dad made a call."

"CUT TO FRONT OF YALE"
"[Luke and Lorelai pull up in Luke's truck]"
"LORELAI: Luke, this was so nice of you, giving me a hand like this. It was above and beyond the call of duty."
"LUKE: Don't start this again."
"LORELAI: I'm not starting anything."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: I mean, if you just had stored the mattress. . ."
"LUKE: That's where we're not starting."
"LORELAI: What? It was your choice to come along."
"LUKE: I wanted the safe return of my truck without the mattress guaranteed. This was the only way."
"LORELAI: You know, I miss our friendship. We used to be so close. The summers at the lake. . ."
"LUKE: Let's just move along here, okay?"
"[Tess walks over to them]"
"TESS: Hi, there."
"LUKE: Hello."
"TESS: Is that your mattress?"
"LUKE: Well, uh, yeah."
"TESS: Hm. Tag has a Yale stamp."
"LUKE: Oh, well, when I said it was mine, it's not mine. It belongs in the dorm. We were just driving it around New Haven for awhile."
"TESS: Uh huh."
"LUKE: To air it out."
"TESS: Oh, okay."
"LUKE: We're gonna take it right back in."
"TESS: Great. [walks away]"
"LUKE: Thanks for jumping in."
"LORELAI: You seemed to have a handle on it."
"LUKE: What do we do now?"
"LORELAI: Unload. [walks away]"
"LUKE: With the mattress. What do we do with the mattress?"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory greets Lorelai at the door to her suite]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Saw you coming."
"LORELAI: What's up?"
"RORY: You just have to see it."
"[they walk inside]"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Paris?"
"RORY: And Terrence, her life coach."
"LORELAI: Like on Oprah?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Yes. They're setting up her crafts' corner."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Yes."
"PARIS: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Hi, Paris. It's so good to see you."
"PARIS: Same here. Terrence, this is Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi, Terrence."
"TERRENCE: Nice to meet you finally."
"LORELAI: Finally?"
"PARIS: You and I have a bit of a journey left to finish as well."
"LORELAI: I'll clear my schedule."
"PARIS: I was just setting up my craft corner. Some mosaic tiles, some colored beads. Still kind of kids' stuff, but Terrence showed me how working with my hands could help with my nerves."
"TANNA: Oh, where are we gonna put the couch?"
"PARIS: Why don't you just -"
"TERRENCE: Paris. . ."
"PARIS: Come on, Terrence."
"TERRENCE: Two steps forward, three steps back."
"PARIS: But she was baiting me."
"TERRENCE: Fish can choose not to bite."
"PARIS: We'll figure it out."
"[Luke comes to the door]"
"LUKE: This the place?"
"LORELAI: This is the place."
"[Luke starts pulling the mattress into the room]"
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, hold it a minute! You can't bring that thing in here."
"LUKE: Well, I'm not taking it back out. Hi, Rory."
"RORY: Hi, Luke."
"LORELAI: No, we're unloading bags and boxes first."
"LUKE: Look, that Tess already had her antennae up about the mattress and she wouldn't stop watching me, so I had to do something."
"LORELAI: Well, wait until she's gone and then bring it back out."
"LUKE: It's heavy. The only way I got it into the building is with help from Chip - his real name, believe it or not. Now I have to go help him unload his stuff because that was the deal."
"LORELAI: No, you don't. Blow him off. He's probably busy taping his Carmen Electra poster up on the ceiling above his bed."
"LUKE: The mattress stays. Now if you'll excuse me, Chip is waiting. [leaves]"
"PARIS: Oh no! My glue g*n leaked on my macaroni!"
"TERRENCE: Compartmentalize. . . and breathe."
"RORY: Let's get this thing out of the hallway."
"LORELAI: Hey, uh, I got a crisp Benjamin Franklin for anyone willing to disappear a mattress, no questions asked."
"RORY: Start pushing."
"LORELAI: Anyone? Two Benjamins? Hold on."
"CUT TO DORM HALLWAY"
"[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the suite toward the exit doors]"
"LORELAI: Anything else you need, you'll write it down, okay?"
"RORY: I've got more than I need. Stuff I don't need."
"LORELAI: It's all necessary stuff."
"RORY: The disco ball?"
"LORELAI: You cannot host your much-anticipated Salute to Barry White Night without a disco ball."
"RORY: I forgot I was anticipating that. Where's Luke?"
"LORELAI: He's already out at the truck. So, this is it."
"RORY: This is really it."
"LORELAI: Learn a lot of stuff."
"RORY: I'll try."
"LORELAI: You'll be a frequent visitor?"
"RORY: I'll be a frequent visitor."
"LORELAI: You can use the washer and the dryer."
"RORY: I don't need any inducement."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: But don't you get rid of that washer and dryer."
"LORELAI: I won't. Ciao, baby."
"RORY: Bye, Mom."
"[Lorelai leaves. Rory walks back into her room and sits on her bed]"
"CUT TO STARS HOLLOW"
"[Luke and Lorelai arrive back in town]"
"LUKE: So Chip is like, ""Set your side down first"" and I'm like, ""My side's the side with the leg missing. It's gonna collapse. You put your side down first"" and he's like, ""I'm losing my grip"", which was his excuse with everything we carried in - the TV, the stereo speakers. And I was like -"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, will you, like, get over this?"
"[Lorelai's pager goes off]"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: It's my pager. [checks it] Oh no."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: ""Come back."""
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's from Rory. It says ""Come back"" with about a dozen exclamation points. Uh, move, move."
"LUKE: What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I gotta borrow your truck."
"LUKE: No way."
"LORELAI: I gotta go back."
"LUKE: Well, then take your own car. Remember that concept?"
"LORELAI: No, it'll take too long to walk back to get it. Plus, I'm out of gas. Plus, it's been making weird noises and probably can't take a long trip. Please, Luke?"
"LUKE: I need my truck."
"LORELAI: I need it more."
"LUKE: You've had it all day."
"LORELAI: Don't you care about Rory?"
"LUKE: Of course I care about Rory. [sighs] Have it back by seven."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Luke."
"[Luke gets out of the truck and Lorelai slides over to the driver's side. She shifts the gear and the truck rolls back a little]"
"LORELAI: Ooh!"
"LUKE: That's reverse."
"LORELAI: I know. [she drives off]"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Rory is sitting on her bed when Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Rory?"
"[Rory jumps up and hugs her]"
"LORELAI: Oh, whoa, oh, honey, honey."
"RORY: Look at this, look at this."
"LORELAI: Look at what?"
"RORY: Four hours at Yale and I'm already homesick."
"LORELAI: Well, that's okay."
"RORY: All I could think of the minute you left was ""I want my mommy."" I haven't thought that since I was two."
"LORELAI: That's natural."
"RORY: I'm eighteen. I can sign contracts, I can vote, I can fight for my country. I mean, I'm an adult. Adults don't want their mommies."
"LORELAI: Yes, they do, honey. I'm not a good example, but -"
"RORY: Everything's so foreign. I have to share a bathroom. I've never shared a bathroom with anyone but you. So I'm gonna be running into people in the bathroom, we're gonna have to make small talk. I don't know any bathroom small talk."
"LORELAI: Um. . .gee, your hair smells terrific?"
"RORY: You didn't socialize me properly. You made me a mama's girl. Why don't I hate you? Why don't I want to be away from you? It's going to be very hard to be Christiane Amanpour broadcasting live from a foxhole in Tehran with my mommy. I guess you're just gonna have to learn how to operate a camera 'cause I'll need you there with me."
"LORELAI: I would do that."
"RORY: And how did I end up at Yale? I mean, I let Grandma and Grandpa manipulate me right out of Harvard and into Yale. That's how strong-willed I am. I know nothing about Yale."
"LORELAI: Not so - you've memorized its entire history."
"RORY: How can you be so fine with this? You left here without a care in the world."
"LORELAI: That's not true."
"RORY: You couldn't wait for me to get out of the house. What were you doing when I paged you - turning my room into a sewing room? I should hate you, not miss you. Do something to make me hate you."
"LORELAI: Uh. . .go h*tler!"
"RORY: Check this out."
"LORELAI: Your student ID?"
"RORY: I'm blinking and my head's in a funny place."
"LORELAI: No, it's not."
"RORY: I look like Keith Richards at Altamont. And check out the name."
"LORELAI: Ronny Gilmore. Oops."
"RORY: Yeah, oops. I don't even exist. And how did they get Ronny? That's not even remotely close to being short for any girl's name in the history of the entire planet."
"LORELAI: Well, Veronica, actually. . .sorry."
"RORY: Great, now I have you apologizing to me after I made you come back all this way just 'cause I'm a big fat stinkin' mama's girl. Mom! [hugs her]"
"LORELAI: I'm here."
"RORY: But you're not supposed to be."
"LORELAI: Where is it written?"
"RORY: Well, it's not exactly written, but it's clearly implied that the parents are supposed to leave the campus at some point."
"LORELAI: Yeah, at some point. So we choose the point."
"RORY: So can you stay for dinner?"
"LORELAI: I can stay all night."
"RORY: No, you can't do that."
"LORELAI: Why not?"
"RORY: Because then I'm the pathetic person who needs her mother to stay all night and everyone here will see and know that."
"LORELAI: Okay, so I won't spend the night."
"RORY: No, stay the night. [hugs her]"
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Lorelai walks into the common room carrying some takeout.]"
"LORELAI: I've got Balinese. Where does Bali go?"
"PARIS: We're still putting everything in geographic order. East to west."
"LORELAI: That's the system. Where is Bali?"
"RORY: Indonesia."
"PARIS: Is Indonesia east or west of the Philippines?"
"TANNA: East."
"RORY: No, west."
"LORELAI: Near Singapore? We've got Singapore here somewhere."
"TANNA: Find Sri Lanka, it's a bit over from that."
"LORELAI: But there's no Sri Lankan food."
"RORY: Just put it by Vietnam."
"PARIS: Is Vietnam east or west of the Philippines?"
"LORELAI: Ooh, boy, you guys really need to go to college."
"RORY: We ordered too much food."
"LORELAI: Hello, the point. We need a wide cross section for our local takeout test."
"TANNA: I still smell glue from your glue g*n."
"PARIS: You're rich, you know that?"
"LORELAI: What is this? You've eaten Indian food, yet I see nothing about Indian food on the chart."
"RORY: We'll get to it."
"LORELAI: The whole point of getting everything within delivery distance is so we can judge the quality of food, speed of service,"
"CUTeness of delivery guys on a scale of one to ten. We cannot work from memory on this."
"[the phone rings]"
"RORY: Where's the phone?"
"PARIS: Uh, under Mexico."
"LORELAI: I bet it's the pizza. Come help."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Lorelai and Rory walk outside to get the pizza delivery]"
"LORELAI: Hello, eight and a half."
"PIZZA GUY: I'm sorry?"
"RORY: Nothing. We just need to sign for the credit card?"
"PIZZA GUY: Yes."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"[they take the pizzas and walk back toward the suite]"
"RORY: We're four people and we ordered for like four hundred."
"LORELAI: So, what you're saying is you wanna crank it up? You wanna set it off? You wanna put a match to the keg and burn this mofo down?"
"RORY: I'm just saying it's a lot of food."
"LORELAI: Attention, Durfee girls!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Food and tons of it in suite five. Bring your appetites, bring your opinions, and, uh, hey, someone bring some music, but if it's Evanescence, you will be severely mocked. Enter, rejoice and come in."
"[Other girls from the floor start walking into the suite]"
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[Later that night, the suite is filled with girls. Lorelai walks out of the suite to get another food delivery]"
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, ice cream man."
"ICE CREAM MAN: Hey."
"LORELAI: Here you go."
"ICE CREAM MAN: Thanks. Have a nice night."
"LORELAI: You, too. Ooh, um, do me a favor? Count to ten before you leave."
"ICE CREAM MAN: Sure."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"[Lorelai walks back into the suite]"
"LORELAI: Hey, rate him, rate him!"
"[several girls rush to the window to see the delivery boy]"
"LORELAI: Hey, where does ice cream stand on our organizational system?"
"RORY: Our organizational system broke down about an hour ago."
"TANNA: Germany fell on China."
"LORELAI: Well, that's Germany for ya. Okay, we're out of Chinese completely, so we know Chinese is popular. Freddy's Happy Tokyo Takeout is a bust. That's the consensus, so let's lose the Freddy's menus, although Ang the delivery guy was a solid nine. If you're gonna go to Baja Bill's, you must get the cheese quesadilla, and ask for Stan or Tommy. If you don't get Stan or Tommy, go to Paco's Tacos. The delivery guys are butt ugly but the food is better. Look at all these girls together in one room having fun. We should dance and sing a Motown song into our hairbrushes. [walks away]"
"PARIS: So, do you like your adoptive parents?"
"TANNA: Yeah."
"PARIS: I think it's good to be adopted. If you get sick of them, you just dump this set and go find the originals."
"[a girl walks up to Rory]"
"GIRL: This is awesome."
"RORY: Thanks."
"GIRL: Who did all this?"
"RORY: The woman with the hairbrush."
"LORELAI: Uh, you guys, come on. I know it's cheesy but just a couple bars. . . You Can't Hurry Love? Someone's gotta do it, it doesn't have to be on key."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[That night, Rory and Paris are in their bedroom. Paris is on the phone]"
"PARIS: [on phone] It's lacking in storage space, but I've accepted it. It's a bit musty, but I've accepted it. Small. Small, but I've accepted it. Hey, listen, I should be going. Jamie, Terrence is not here, he's back in his room. Oh, right, me and Terrence, that's a possibility. I really gotta go, okay? I will. Good night. [hangs up]"
"RORY: Has he met Terrence?"
"PARIS: Nope, and he's not going to for as long as I can help it."
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: I fixed your shower head."
"RORY: Really? But it was barely dribbling out."
"LORELAI: It just needed a twist. You've got a waterfall now."
"RORY: You're so handy."
"LORELAI: And my rates are reasonable."
"PARIS: My turn?"
"LORELAI: It's all yours."
"[Paris leaves]"
"RORY: No, Mom, you sleep on the new mattress."
"LORELAI: But it's yours."
"RORY: Well, they're both mine, so I get to choose. I'll sleep on the Yale mattress."
"LORELAI: But you have to break in your new mattress. If it molds to my body, your shorter body will be wallowing in the hollowness of my body."
"RORY: In one night?"
"LORELAI: It's the crucial night, that first night."
"RORY: Okay, but my offer still stands, so if you get the heebie-jeebies in the middle of the night over there, come join me."
"LORELAI: That'll get the girls talking. We'll be those dirty, filthy, almost-French Stars Hollow girls. [in French accent] Oh, we spit on you, you repressed puritanical ninnies."
"RORY: [in French accent] We smirk in your general direction."
"LORELAI: [in French accent] We cast sidelong glances that are vague but slightly threatening."
"RORY: [in French accent] We eschew your quaint double entendre for the appealing lasciviousness of the entendre singular."
"LORELAI: We. . .eh. . .I'm out."
"RORY: Me, too. Get the light."
"LORELAI: Did I tell you I found good coffee?"
"RORY: No, where?"
"LORELAI: The little kiosk by the library. I found it on the way to that parents thing."
"RORY: Cool."
"LORELAI: I'll circle it on the map for you."
"RORY: Good."
"[they hear a howling sound]"
"LORELAI: Is that some guy howling?"
"RORY: I don't know, sounded like it."
"[they hear another howl]"
"LORELAI: Sounds like the guys' floor had some fun tonight, too."
"RORY: I'd say so."
"[there's another howl; Lorelai responds with a howl]"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: Well, if no one answers him, he may never stop."
"[several guys start howling]"
"LORELAI: Or it'll get a bunch of other guys howling, one or the other. [howls again]"
"RORY: Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: It's fun."
"[Rory howls]"
"RORY: It is fun."
"[they both howl]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[The next morning, Lorelai and Rory walk out of Rory's bedroom]"
"LORELAI: So, what's first on the agenda today?"
"RORY: Well, I have a little time, so I thought I might walk around and get the lay of the land a little bit, and then I have my big freshman assembly."
"LORELAI: Where they teach you the secret Yale handshake?"
"RORY: Amongst other things."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, check out Paris' craft corner."
"RORY: She gets more done before nine than other people do all day."
"LORELAI: She's a craft person now, so it's not safe to leave anything around her anymore."
"RORY: Maybe that's where crafty comes from."
"LORELAI: Good point."
"[they walk out into the hallway]"
"LORELAI: All right, I should go. I called Luke last night and he made me promise to get the truck back by two hours ago, so if I leave now it's sooner than I planned."
"RORY: Thank Luke a lot for me, okay?"
"LORELAI: Okay, say goodbye to Paris and Tanna."
"RORY: Will do."
"LORELAI: So, this is really it."
"RORY: Yup."
"LORELAI: You good?"
"RORY: I'm good. Just keep your pager with you."
"LORELAI: Always."
"[they hug, Lorelai leaves]"
"CUT TO LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LUKE: You're late."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"LUKE: It's okay. I told you to get it back three hours before I actually needed it back and it worked out perfectly."
"LORELAI: You rat."
"LUKE: So it's in park?"
"LORELAI: It's in park."
"LUKE: Engine's off?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Here are your keys. And thank you, Luke. I've been a huge burden on you the past couple days."
"LUKE: It's okay. [he looks out the window] I don't believe it."
"[They walk outside to the truck. The Yale mattress is in the back]"
"LUKE: It's like a horror movie."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: The mattress that would not leave my truck."
"LORELAI: I had no choice."
"LUKE: I may cry."
"LORELAI: Don't do that."
"LUKE: I don't want this mattress."
"LORELAI: Help me take it somewhere."
"LUKE: Where? To the conveniently located old mattress drop-off station right around the corner?"
"LORELAI: Or if you could store it for awhile. . ."
"LUKE: I wasn't kidding about the crying."
"LORELAI: I'll call a charity and have them come pick it up. I promise, and this time I mean it."
"LUKE: And where's my spare tire?"
"LORELAI: There was a spare tire?"
"LUKE: I had my spare tire back here."
"LORELAI: Oh, we must've accidentally unloaded it on one of our trips."
"LUKE: Could you try to get it back?"
"LORELAI: Yes, as long as Paris hasn't made it into a planter yet. Or I'll buy you a new one, I promise."
"LUKE: Okay, I'll see you later."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye. Oh, and, um, Rory says thanks for everything, too. She said specifically to tell you."
"LUKE: Okay, good. So she's okay?"
"LORELAI: She's fantastic."
"LUKE: Good."
"CUT TO YALE DORM"
"[There's knock on Rory's suite door. She answers it; two girls are there]"
"GIRL 1: You're up?"
"RORY: I was up. Come on in."
"GIRL 1: We Lorelai'd a few places and found the good coffee."
"RORY: Lorelai'd?"
"GIRL 2: Checked places out."
"GIRL 1: Seems like the appropriate word. We found decent muffins, too, but I bet there's better out there."
"RORY: You'll Lorelai 'em another time."
"GIRL 1: [hands her a coffee] So this is thanks for last night. It was a perfect first night at Yale."
"RORY: I thought so."
"GIRL 2: We're gonna go to freshman assembly together. Do you wanna come?"
"RORY: Sure."
"GIRL 1: Then we're all going to conveniently lose our student ID's and go take new pictures."
"RORY: Oh my God, I'm so with you on that one."
"GIRL 1: Cool."
"RORY: [sips coffee] Mm. Whoa, this is really good. Kiosk by the library?"
"GIRL 1: Oh, you found it first."
"RORY: Kind of."
"CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai walks into the empty house. She stands in the living room and looks around.]"
