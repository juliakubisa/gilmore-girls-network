DEAN: [OS] I love you, Rory.
RORY: [OS] I love you, too, Dean.
CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM
[Rory and Dean lie together in her single bed, following their lovemaking]
RORY: Are you comfortable? Am I k*ll your arm?
DEAN: My arm is fine.
RORY: I could move.
DEAN: Don't you dare move.
RORY: This right here, is -- the textbook definition of a perfect moment.
DEAN: Yeah, it is.
RORY: And earlier? [pause]
DEAN: That was pretty perfect too. However, as a guy, I was trying not to be a pig. [kisses her shoulder gently]
RORY: And I'm happy, are you happy?
DEAN: I'm very happy.
RORY: [smiling] Happy, but not chatty?
DEAN: I'm just… trying to make sure that all this is really happening.
RORY: It is. [they kiss] Hey, you know what I think we need?
DEAN: What?
RORY: A song. Like a song that's "our song".
DEAN: Okay.
RORY: Something romantic, but not mushy, something that will make us remember this.
DEAN: [chuckle] Ah, believe me, I'm remembering this.
RORY: Oh, I know. [She reaches over to the nightstand and loads a nearby CD into her player and turns it on.] Okay. Perfect. So, from now on, no matter what you're doing, where you are, you'll stop and think of me when you hear this [clicks remote on. Sammy Davis Jr.'s "The Candy Man" plays.]
DEAN: [laughs] That's not gonna be our song.
RORY: Why not? It's perfect. It's happy. It's hopeful. It has the word 'candy' in it. Hey, what is more hot than candy?
DEAN: Pick something else.
RORY: [She bobs to the music b*at and repeats the lyric in a high squeaky voice] "Who can take the sunrise… sprinkle it with dew"
DEAN: Okay, okay, okay, okay. I'll pick something else. [He struggles to snatch the remote from her.]
RORY: No.
DEAN: Hand it over, I can't take it anymore.
RORY: This is what happens when the women get the remote, ah-ha!
[Thud noise from outside the bedroom interrupts them]
DEAN: What was that? [door closes]
LORELAI: [OS] Rory!
[CUT TO THE KITCHEN A FEW MOMENTS LATER]
[Rory darts out of her room followed closely by Dean]
LORELAI: Hey, what's going on?
RORY: [smoothing her hair] Dean came over to borrow something.
[CAMERA POV CHANGES TO KITCHEN DOOR LOOKING IN FROM OUTSIDE]
DEAN: Yeah, thanks.
RORY: You're welcome.
DEAN: Well, ah, I should go... bye, Lorelai.
RORY: Bye, Dean.
[Dean walks out the kitchen door and closes it. He listens to the conversation coming from inside]
LORELAI: [OS] So, what did he borrow?
RORY: [OS] I'm sorry I didn't talk to you about it first. I - I know I promised I would, but I swear, I didn't know that this was going to happen. I mean, I didn't know he was going to show up tonight, and it just happened. It's awful for you to find out like this, I know, but everything's okay. I'm okay, and we were, you know, safe - so all those Trojan Man jokes all these years really apparently stuck. And I'm lucky, too, because Dean, he's -- well, aren't you glad that it happened with someone who's good and really loves me?
LORELAI: [OS] He's married.
RORY: [OS] You don't understand the situation.
LORELAI: [OS] Is he still married?
RORY: [OS] Yes, but -
LORELAI: [OS] Then I understand the situation.
[Outside, Dean cringes and walks around to the front of the house to leave. The conversation still audible, he sees Rory through the lacey drapes and pauses.]
LORELAI: [OS] I just want what's best for you, that's all!
RORY: [OS] You're just mad because I didn't come running to you to discuss whether or not I was ready for this step. I decided it on my own.
LORELAI: [OS voice fades as Dean exits] Obviously, you weren't ready for this step.
[CUT TO EXTERIOR FRONT DOOR]
[Rory exits front door and pulls on sweater. Dials a number on her cell phone, as she steps off the front porch]
LINDSAY VOICE: [answering phone] Hello? Hello? Hello?
[Rory hangs up and sinks to her knees and begins to cry. Lorelai exits the front door and watches her daughter sobbing on the front lawn. She slowly approaches her daughter, bends over her and gently touches her shoulder.]
LORELAI: Hey. [Rory flinches from her touch] Let's just talk.
RORY: No. [She stands and stumbles back into the house. Lorelai looks grim.]
[OPEN IN ELDER GILMORE HOME FRONT DOOR]
[Door opens and Emily rushes in with determined purpose. Richard enters at a slower pace and follows her to small cluttered desk in a corner.]
RICHARD: You do realize you just leapt out of a moving vehicle.
EMILY: Everything cannot be on your schedule, Richard. [shuffles through small drawers on the desktop] Now, where is it? I know I put it in here. [She picks up a small, thin blue booklet.] Aha!
RICHARD: In all the years we've been together, I have never seen you behave as irrationally as -- Emily, I'm talking to you! Will you stop? [Emily storms down the hallway, brushing aside a nearby potted palm tree frond] Emily, this feud of ours has now reached comical heights that… Charlie Chaplin, himself, would find hilarious, and he's dead.
EMILY: Don't follow me, Richard.
RICHARD: Oh, wait, come back. Let me get you a cane and a derby.
[CUT TO BASEMENT]
[Emily descends the stairs to a room crowded full of boxes, trunks, unused furniture, dusty oil paintings, a discarded pool table, old silver trays and brass pieces. Richard follows her.]
RICHARD: What are you doing?
EMILY: I'm looking for my European luggage, which some imbecile has chosen to hide from me.
RICHARD: What do you need your European luggage for?
EMILY: To put things in.
RICHARD: You're making a mess.
EMILY: I don't care if I'm making a mess.
RICHARD: Well, who's going to clean all this up, you?
EMILY: Yes, me, or the maid, or perhaps Pennilyn Lott could come by after one of your clandestine luncheons and take a stab at it.
RICHARD: Oh, for heaven's sakes. Not that again. She's just a friend!
EMILY: [provoking grin] I am going to Europe, Richard. I am going to Europe, and I'm going to have a marvelous time. I'm going to get up at 10:00, and I'm going to have two glasses of wine at lunch every single day.
RICHARD: Only prostitutes have two glasses of wine at lunch.
EMILY: Well, then buy me a boa and drive me to Reno because I am open for business.
RICHARD: I -- I can't talk to you when you're like this. I'm going to bed. [exits to stairs]
EMILY: You go to bed. I'll go to France.
[Richard climbs the stairs to the main floor. Door slams ]
[ After a pause, light piano music begins playing faintly from upstairs. Emily struggles with a large steamer trunk, dragging it up the stairs. As she reaches the door, she grasps the door knob and discovers the door won't budge.]
EMILY: Richard! Richard! [pounds on the door] The door is stuck! Richard! This isn't funny!
[She descends the stairs and looks around anxiously. Spying a high set window, she approaches and opens it and calls out.]
EMILY: Richard? Richard!
RICHARD: [OS] Emily?
EMILY: You locked me in.
RICHARD: [OS] I did not lock you in.
EMILY: You certainly did lock me in.
RICHARD: [OS] The door must be jammed. Did you try jiggling the knob?
EMILY: I suppose I could do that, or you could just get the hell down here and let me out!
RICHARD: [OS] Give me a moment, please.
EMILY: If you don't come down here right now, I will climb out the window.
RICHARD: [OS] You will not climb out the window.
EMILY: I will. I will climb out the window right now.
RICHARD: [OS] Don't you dare.
EMILY: I'm doing it. I'm climbing out the window. [she begins crawling out the window]
RICHARD: [OS] You better not climb out the window.
EMILY: [skirt catches on a nail] Damn it.
RICHARD: [OS] Emily Gilmore, I better not catch you climbing out the window. [sounds of footsteps]
EMILY: [panics and unzips her skirt to break free] I'm out the window. I'm out the window.
RICHARD: [descends the stairs] Get down from there.
EMILY: No! [slips out the window in only her sweater and hose]
RICHARD: Emily, get back here. Emily! [snatches her empty skirt dangling from nail]
[CUT TO EXTERIOR]
[Emily pulls her long sweater tightly down to cover herself and tiptoes to the back. Door opens ]
RICHARD: Are you having an aneurysm or something? Get inside and put this on.
EMILY: Get away from me!
RICHARD: Do you seriously think after 39 years of marriage, I would resort to locking you in a basement? [follows her to front of house]
EMILY: I don't know what you'd resort to. I don't know who you are at all.
RICHARD: I knew the mental illness in your family would catch up with you eventually.
EMILY: Aunt Cora was not mentally ill! She was athletic!
[flashing lights of a car approaches]
RICHARD: Oh, fine.
[ Indistinct talking over radio. Door of a DuBaldo Security Systems car opens and officer approaches. ]
SECURITY OFFICER: Is there some sort of problem here, folks?
RICHARD: No. There's no problem.
SECURITY OFFICER: We got a call from some of your neighbors complaining about a disturbance.
RICHARD: We apologize. We're going inside right now.
EMILY: Do not tell me what to do.
SECURITY OFFICER: Can I have your security password, please?
RICHARD: [sarcasm] Look, it's getting late, so either sh**t us or go away.
SECURITY OFFICER: Fine. We'll just write up a report here and be on our way.
EMILY: Are you happy, Richard? Now there's a report, and a report means we'll be in the police blotter. Petal Huffington reads the police blotter religiously. It's like heroin to her. You've turned us into the scandal of the neighborhood. [Officer exits.]
RICHARD: Do you know what, Emily? If nothing else, this display tonight demonstrates clearly that you are no longer the woman I married.
EMILY: The woman you married was your partner. You listened to her. You consulted with her. You respected her. So, you are right, Richard. I am definitely not the woman you married. [ Engine turns over as she exits to the house]
[CUT TO INTERIOR OF DRAGONFLY INN - FRONT DOOR]
[Lorelai enters and immediately sees Luke in the front sitting room. Kirk is propped face first on the sofa naked, his butt in the air and a blanket covering him. ]
LORELAI: Oh, no.
LUKE: It's okay.
LORELAI: What happened?
LUKE: He landed butt first in Taylor's rose bushes.
LORELAI: Oh, poor thing!
LUKE: Didn't slow him down, though. I managed to tackle him as he headed toward the miniature goat pen, dragged him back here, threw one of your blankets over him, and, well, there he is -- he's gonna be fine.
LORELAI: Well, that's good.
LUKE: Yeah. So, you were gone for a while.
LORELAI: Yeah, I just had some things to take care of at home. Are you sure he can breathe?
LUKE: Oh, yeah, I propped his head up. ? [He notices she is distracted.] So, uh...you okay?
LORELAI: Yes, I'm fine.
LUKE: Okay, just -- nothing you want to talk about with -- with me or - ?
KIRK: Oh!
LORELAI: Oh my God. We need to take him upstairs.
KIRK: [still face down] LuLu can't see me like this.
LORELAI: But, Kirk --
KIRK: [hysterical] LuLu can't see me like this!
LORELAI: Okay, she won't. I promise. Can I take a look?
KIRK: [quickly responds] Okay.
LORELAI: I don't want to take a look.
LUKE: Well, I'm not looking.
[Sookie descends the stairs and approaches]
SOOKIE: Hey! It's a party. What's everybody doing up?
LORELAI: Aw, hey, good timing, Squiggy.
[Luke and Lorelai approach Sookie]
SOOKIE: I was just going to check on my loaves and make sure they're rising properly. The air's a little more humid than I thought it was going to be, and if the loaves aren't rising properly, then -- what are you doing? [They both pull Sookie closer to the sofa]
LORELAI: We need you to look at Kirk's butt.
SOOKIE: Why?
LORELAI: Well, because he ran into some rose bushes, and he's got some thorns stuck in it, and I thought of you.
SOOKIE: Me? Why me?
LORELAI: Well, because... you're a chef.
SOOKIE: What?
LUKE: And you have a kid.
LORELAI: Yes, that's better. You have a kid.
LUKE: Neither of us has kids. Well, she does, but it's big and -- and -- and can look at her own butt.
LORELAI: I got this, thanks.
SOOKIE: Okay, well... oh, oh! I'm gonna need Bactine, antiseptic, and lots of hot towels.
LORELAI: I'll go. I'll be right back. [she exits]
KIRK: Ohh.
SOOKIE: Hey, Kirk? How are you feeling?
KIRK: Is Luke here?
LUKE: I'm right here, Kirk.
KIRK: Sorry I bit you.
LUKE: It's okay, Kirk.
KIRK: They were after me, so I ran away.
SOOKIE: Who was after you, honey?
LUKE: Assassins. He thinks assassins are after him.
KIRK: They were under my bed in my room, so I ran, and they followed me down the hall, down the stairs, past Luke and Lorelai kissing, through the yard, over that fence. [Sookie rolls her eyes and smiles in disbelief, Luke looks uncomfortable]
SOOKIE: Well, the assassins are gone now, Kirk.
KIRK: I imagined them?
SOOKIE: I think so.
KIRK: What about Luke kissing Lorelai?
SOOKIE: [ Chuckles ] I think you imagined that, too. [she glances at Luke and does a double take when she sees his expression]
KIRK: They looked so real.
SOOKIE: Okay, Kirk, you just settle down and relax, and I'll be right back. [She drags Luke away from the sofa out of earshot.] Ohh. [ Gasps ] Oh, my God!
LUKE: Sookie!
SOOKIE: You kissed?
LUKE: [tries to suppress a grin] Yes.
SOOKIE: I can't believe she didn't tell me. Why didn't she tell me?
LUKE: It just happened.
SOOKIE: Ooh, Luke, that's wonderful! [pulls him into a big hug]
LUKE: [ chuckles ] Thanks.
SOOKIE: [giggling with excitement] I can't wait to tell Lorelai it's wonderful!
LUKE: Um, could you maybe not say anything for a little while?
SOOKIE: Why?
LUKE: Well, I'm just not so sure she wants this out yet.
SOOKIE: What makes you think that?
LUKE: Do me a favor and keep it to yourself. Let her tell you if she wants to, okay?
SOOKIE: Sure. Okay. Call me Belinda, 'cause my lips are sealed.
LUKE: Thank you. [chuckles]
SOOKIE: Hey, Luke?
LUKE: Yeah?
SOOKIE: This is good. [exits to return to Kirk leaving Luke alone]
LUKE: I hope so.
[CUT TO DEAN AND LINDSAY'S APARTMENT]
[Dean quietly enters and deposits his keys on the entry table]
LINDSAY: Hey.
DEAN: [Startled, he turns around and sees her sitting at kitchen table] Hey.
LINDSAY: My mom brought by brownies. [Dean doesn't respond but walks past her to the kitchen] You worked late again.
DEAN: Yeah.
LINDSAY: Do you have to work tomorrow?
DEAN: I work at Doose's tomorrow.
LINDSAY: Oh. Well, will you be home for dinner? 'Cause I was thinking of cooking or something.
DEAN: I guess. I'll try. I don't know.
LINDSAY: You want a brownie?
DEAN: No.
LINDSAY: My mom put gummy bears in them like I'm still three or something. [silence] Oh yeah, and I found your phone. It had fallen in the couch cushions.
DEAN: Thanks.
LINDSAY: It rang a little earlier, about 20 minutes ago. I answered, but they hung up.
DEAN: You answered my phone?
LINDSAY: Well, it kind of woke me up.
DEAN: Why are you answering people's phones?
LINDSAY: Dean.
DEAN: I mean, you know it's my phone, Lindsay. This isn't your phone. I mean, who was it?
LINDSAY: I don't know. They hung up.
DEAN: So you didn't take a message?
LINDSAY: I told you -- they hung up.
DEAN: So, great, uh, you're just answering my phone and not taking messages? That's great, Lindsay.
LINDSAY: Dean, wh--
DEAN: Taylor calls on this phone, and Tom. I mean, this phone is for business, okay? That's why I have it!
LINDSAY: Fine.
DEAN: What if Tom called, and he had an extra shift for me tomorrow, huh? I mean he calls to tell me, and you answer, and he thinks maybe he doesn't have the right number, and he hangs up, and then I just lose out, which means we lose out. God, Lindsay, you know, you don't -- you don't get it, do you? I mean, you have absolutely no respect for me at all. That's just obvious.[ Sighs ]
LINDSAY: I don't want to fight. We always fight. I won't answer your phone anymore. I was asleep. I didn't think. I'm sorry, okay?
DEAN: Yeah...okay.
LINDSAY: You coming to bed?
DEAN: In a minute.
LINDSAY: [ Inhales ] Okay. [stands to leave] You mad at me?
DEAN: No. Just tired. Long day. I'll be right there.
[CUT TO BREAKFAST BUFFET LINE AT DRAGONFLY INN - MORNING]
[LuLu and Kirk are admiring the food table and taking samples on their plate
LULU: Everything looks so good.
SOOKIE: [giggles] I know it does.
LULU: [they move to a small nearby table. LuLu sits down.] I want half of that cranberry square.
KIRK: Okay.
LULU: Kirk, sit.
KIRK: I'm good.
LULU: You can't eat standing up like that. My mother says it gives you cancer.
KIRK: Really? Mine, too.
[Jackson enters]
JACKSON: Hey, look who came to visit.
BABETTE: Oh, my God, the baby's here!
SOOKIE: [approaches] Hey, Shortstuff. How's it hangin'?
JACKSON: He just came to say hi to everybody and to see the place on which his entire college education depends. What do you think? Is it gonna be Ivy League, or is it gonna be "Murray's House of Learnin'"?
SOOKIE: If we're going by the donut demand, I think he's in pretty good shape.
JACKSON: Okay, Ivy League it is. [baby talk to Davey] I just hope you're not stupid. Yeah?
SOOKIE: Well, you have fun. Mommy's gotta get back to work. Be nice, and don't throw up on the buffet.
PATTY: Jackson, you get over here right now with that baby.
[CUT TO FRONT LOBBY NEAR STAIRS]
[employee approaches Michel and presents a clipboard]
EMPLOYEE: Can you sign this? [when finished he exits as Taylor descends the stairs]
[Michel ignores him]
TAYLOR: Michel, hold it right there. Michel. Michel, I have a complaint. Michel? Michel?
MICHEL: Can I help you?
TAYLOR: I was talking to you, and you just walked away from me.
MICHEL: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were calling someone else.
TAYLOR: Someone else named Michel?
MICHEL: If only I could read minds. What can I do for you?
TAYLOR: One of my shoes is missing, and the other has been chewed.
MICHEL: Is this a riddle? I'm very busy.
TAYLOR: No, this is not a riddle. This is fact. Look at this shoe. This shoe was practically brand-new, worn twice, and only on smooth-surface floors. [Lorelai descends the stairs and avoids them] I leave it in your hallway, and in the morning, I find this. [LuLu and Kirk enter. Kirk overhears their conversation]
KIRK: Oh, my God, what have I done? [rushes after LuLu up the stairs]
[Lorelai enters and approaches]
LORELAI: Excuse me. I'm sorry. Taylor, why did you leave your shoe in the hallway?
TAYLOR: Your complimentary shoeshine.
LORELAI: Our - [Confused]
MICHEL: I don't know what he's talking about.
[Luke bounds down the stairs with his duffel bag over his shoulder]
LUKE: Hey, Lorelai --
TAYLOR: Oh, no problem, Luke. Butt right in. I couldn't possibly be talking about anything important.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: Uh. [She joins Luke a few feet away]
LUKE: I just -- I have to get back to the diner.
LORELAI: Okay, well, um - I… [glances at Michel and Taylor]
TAYLOR: I'm still standing here.
LORELAI: I have to - [distracted]
LUKE: Uh, sure.
LORELAI: Okay. But, thank you so much for coming.
LUKE: Okay, I'll...guess I'll see you later.
LORELAI: Yeah. [immediately returns to Taylor and Michel]
TAYLOR: You think I'm making all this up.
[Luke hesitates at the door watching her before leaving]
LORELAI: No, Taylor, I don't think you're making it up.
MICHEL: You're making a scene is what you're making.
TAYLOR: All right, fine. I'm going to find wherever I read that you said you have shoeshine service. I'm going to show you, and then he can take that look off his face.
LORELAI: Taylor, seriously, I completely believe you. [calls after him as he storms off]
MICHEL: That man is why mail-order brides were invented.
LORELAI: Mm.
[Michel exits and she turns to see Rory enter the front door]
LORELAI: Oh, my, my. Well, what a surprise.
RORY: People will expect me to be here for breakfast.
LORELAI: Yes, they will.
RORY: Okay, so I'm here for breakfast.
LORELAI: Enjoy! [Rory enters to dining room]
BABETTE: Rory, we were wondering what happened to you.
RORY: I just ran home early this morning to get something. Hey, Davey. Came for breakfast?
PATTY: Yes, he did. Didn't you, Davey?
JACKSON: Yeah, he did. Oops, he's got that look on his face. You might want to give him back to me.
PATTY: Oh, please, if I went running every time some guy tried to crap all over me, I never would have gotten married. [Lorelai passes through to the kitchen]
[CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN KITCHEN]
[Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Hey, Sookie, what did you want to talk - Oh my!
SOOKIE: [ Squeals and hugs Lorelai] I'm so happy!
LORELAI: I'm so glad you're so happy! Is this is a normal happy or was there cooking sherry involved?
SOOKIE: I promised I wouldn't say anything, but I can't help it! It is so wonderful. Do you know how wonderful it is?
LORELAI: No, no, I don't, but I would love to weigh in.
SOOKIE: You're with Luke!
LORELAI: Ah, how did you know?
SOOKIE: Luke told me.
LORELAI: Oh?
SOOKIE: No, I'm sorry, Luke didn't tell me. Kirk told me.
LORELAI: Kirk told you?
SOOKIE: He saw you. He saw you kiss Luke. Oh, my God! You were kissing Luke!
LORELAI: Well, Sookie, I --
SOOKIE: I am so glad! You two are perfect for each other. I have always thought that someday, if you just sort of turned around and opened your eyes that you'd see it, and now that you have, I'm just so damn happy.
LORELAI: Well, I'm --
SOOKIE: You're not gonna die alone. I mean, somebody will be there. Somebody will know. Somebody will find the body and call the police and --
LORELAI: Yes, that is a relief. I can't believe Kirk saw us. I thought he was asleep.
SOOKIE: Don't worry. I convinced him he was dreaming it all, so I don't think he'll say anything. I know you're concerned about that. Why are you concerned about that?
LORELAI: Who said I was concerned about that?
SOOKIE: Luke -- he asked me not to say anything. He said he wasn't sure if you wanted it out. Why wasn't he sure if you wanted it out?
LORELAI: I don't know.
SOOKIE: How was it?
LORELAI: How was - ?
SOOKIE: You know. Was it on top of a table? 'Cause I always thought it would be on top of a table -- oh, like in "Bull Durham"!
LORELAI: There was no sex.
SOOKIE: No sex? Why no sex? [ Gasps ] Can't Luke?
LORELAI: I'm sure he can. There was no time. Everything happened so fast. We were here with the town -- and my parents flipping out and Jason showing up. Oh, no! Jason! What happened to Jason?
SOOKIE: Oh, his condo was on fire.
LORELAI: It was?
SOOKIE: Well, that's what Michel had me say when we called his cell phone. Hey, you don't seem happy.
LORELAI: About what?
SOOKIE: About Luke!
LORELAI: Of course I'm happy about Luke. It's just new. I'm still processing it, that's all.
SOOKIE: But he knows you're happy, right? I mean, he knows you're processing, but once you process, there's gonna be sex, right?
LORELAI: He knows. I think he knows. He should know. I hope he knows.
SOOKIE: Well, make sure he knows, okay? Because you two together -
LORELAI: Equals getting to the morgue before I smell. I got it.
SOOKIE: Okay. [giggles]
[CUT TO FRONT LOBBY]
[Lorelai enters and sees Rory at the front desk]
LORELAI: Hey. Finish your breakfast already?
RORY: Yeah, I was just leaving you a note.
LORELAI: Oh, you kind of wolfed it down, there.
RORY: I'm a light eater.
LORELAI: So, um, you leaving?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Rory, don't you want to talk?
RORY: We already did.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, but you didn't hear what I wanted to talk about, which was how Jackson is probably gonna have to dislocate several of Davey's limbs trying to pry him away from Patty and Babette.
RORY: I have to go.
LORELAI: [ Sighs ] Rory, can't we just sit down for a second and talk about this?
RORY: I already heard everything you had to say last night.
LORELAI: You know what? Fine. I give. It's your life. Do what you want.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're 19. You know what you're doing.
RORY: I do know what I'm doing.
LORELAI: So you don't want to talk. We won't talk.
RORY: Good.
LORELAI: I wasn't thinking we had to talk like mom and kid. I thought we could talk as friends, but hey, forget it.
RORY: I will.
LORELAI: Not that I take back what I said.
RORY: That's your perogative.
LORELAI: [ Clears throat ] I mean, he's married, and as your friend, I have every right to point out the obvious.
RORY: Which you did twice now.
LORELAI: Okay, and I stand by it, though I felt maybe I could help you figure out how to handle this as your friend who you usually turn to to help you figure out how to handle things, but if you don't want to talk, then fine.
RORY: Great.
LORELAI: We won't talk.
RORY: Love the thought.
LORELAI: Don't worry about me nagging you to talk anymore. I'm out.
RORY: Terrific.
LORELAI: In fact, I'm really busy, so if you did change your mind --
RORY: Which I won't.
LORELAI: Okay. But if you did, I'm sorry. I can't help. Taylor lost a shoe, so get in line.
RORY: Any end to this speech in sight?
LORELAI: Bye.
[Rory exits and door slams ]
[ Footsteps down that stairs - Taylor spies Lorelai]
TAYLOR: Aha! I told you I'd seen it somewhere. Look at this.
LORELAI: Ah, right. Uh, Michel, hi. Could you come over here for a minute? Very sorry about this, Taylor.
MICHEL: Yes?
LORELAI: Hey. Here I have a list of services, all printed up nice and neat, including seaweed wraps, facial peels, watsu massage, and complimentary shoeshines, all of which we do not offer.
MICHEL: Well, we should.
LORELAI: Michel.
MICHEL: I mentioned them several times before, but you don't listen to me. Sookie wants to make each guest a meringue hat, and you say, "Oh, Sookie, what a brilliant idea." But I want to pamper our guests with services that we don't have, and you tell me to answer the phone.
LORELAI: I'm very sorry about this, Taylor. We will replace your shoes, I promise you.
TAYLOR: Fine. I'm a 6 1/2, narrow.
LORELAI: Okay. I can't believe you did this.
MICHEL: Oh, you can too.
LORELAI: Get on the phone and find me shoes and have them here by tonight, and get your dogs off the premises immediately.
MICHEL: My dogs aren't --
LORELAI: It's been a rough weekend. Don't screw with me.
MICHEL: If Kirk can sleep inside, why can't my Chows?
LORELAI: Get them and take them home.
MICHEL: Okay, okay, I just have to locate Pau-Pau.
LORELAI: What?
MICHEL: He went out for a walk. He's around. He was just testing his boundaries.
LORELAI: Apparently, so are you.
MICHEL: I'm going. [ Whistles ] Pau-Pau?
[Lorelai pulls out her cell phone and dials number]
[CUT TO LUKE'S DINER DURING LUNCH RUSH]
[ Telephone ringing - Luke answers ]
LUKE: Luke's.
LORELAI: Hey. [scene switches back and forth between diner and inn]
LUKE: Hello?
LORELAI: [ Louder ] It's me.
LUKE: Oh, hi.
LORELAI: Can we talk?
LUKE: Well, we're kind of busy.
CAESAR: [places two plates on kitchen ledge] Burger and patty melt.
LORELAI: I just wanted to talk.
LUKE: Talk about what?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Talk about what?
LORELAI: Could you find a quieter place?
LUKE: Like where?
LORELAI: Just go outside.
LUKE: Phone doesn't reach outside.
CAESAR: [presents another plate of food] Something that looks like tuna.
LORELAI: Use your cell phone.
LUKE: Uh, I don't have a cell phone.
LORELAI: What happened to the phone Nicole gave you?
LUKE: She got it back in the divorce. Actually, I threw it in the lake after the divorce.
[ Davey crying at the inn - Dishes crashing at the diner]
LUKE: Jeez, what the hell is going on over there?
LORELAI: What's going on over there?
LUKE: Hold on!
LORELAI: You hold on, too.
[Luke stretches phone cord into storeroom and shuts door. Crying continues as Lorelai moves to the inn front closet. Closes the door and leans against it. Noises fade]
LORELAI: I'm good.
LUKE: I'm good, too.
LORELAI: Good!
LUKE: So...you wanted to talk.
LORELAI: Yeah. I just realized that, uh, you know, when I got back last night, I was, um, a little distracted. [slowly slides down the door to sit on the floor and notices Pau-Pau laying next to her chewing on Taylor's missing shoe] Uh,eh.
LUKE: Hey, no big deal.
LORELAI: Uh, no, no, it really was a big deal. I just, um --
LUKE: Seriously, you don't need to --
LORELAI: We kissed. [silence as Luke smiles while remembering] You and me, we kissed?
LUKE: I remember.
LORELAI: And it was...unexpected.
LUKE: Lorelai, relax. I'm fine if you want to just forget it ever happened, really.
LORELAI: No, I don't want to forget it ever happened. It was a great kiss.
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: If one of us had been a frog, it would have had some seriously impressive consequences.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: So, what do you think?
LUKE: I think I'm really relieved you feel that way.
LORELAI: So you concur?
LUKE: Dear God, yes.
LORELAI: Good. So, then, I guess we'll discuss this later.
LUKE: Tonight?
LORELAI: Tonight.
LUKE: Okay. Thanks for the call.
LORELAI: Well, my pleasure.
[ Phone clicks, dial tone ]
LORELAI: You better finish that whole thing, Pau-Pau.



[CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK]
[Rory walks to a payphone and hesitatingly dials a number]
RORY: Hi, it's me. We need to meet.
[CUT TO MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO]
[ Knocking on door ]
RORY: Come in.
DEAN: [whispers] Hey.
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: I'm glad you called.
RORY: Me too.
DEAN: Everything okay at home?
RORY: Yeah. Everything's okay.
DEAN: Good. [moves closer and takes her hands] Did I ever tell you I like your hair?
RORY: My hair?
DEAN: Your shorter hair.
RORY: It's grown out a little.
DEAN: I like it.
RORY: I like it, too.
[Their foreheads touch, then they kiss.]
DEAN: So, um, you wanted to talk?
RORY: Yeah, talk. [Dean caresses her arm and face before he leans close again] words... wow. [Their kiss becomes more passionate.]
[CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT - LANE'S BEDROOM]
LANE: [shocked] You what?
RORY: I slept with Dean in my room last night, in my bed.
LANE: Oh, my God!
RORY: I know. Who would have even thought that Dean could fit in my bed. I mean, it's so small, and he's not small. He's tall, not small. Great, I'm rhyming.
LANE: I didn't know you were even back together.
RORY: Well, we're not. I mean, I guess we are now, but -- I'm out of breath.
LANE: Sit down.
RORY: My mom caught us.
LANE: Oh, my God.
RORY: I mean, she didn't catch us. We were done, but she -- we were still horizontal, and then she saw Dean come out of my room, and she just said all these things.
LANE: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
RORY: What?
LANE: I'm just picturing it in my head, and -- oh, my God!
ZACH: [OS] Lane!
LANE: I'm busy!
ZACH: [OS] Okay, but hello?
LANE: Go, talk, please.
RORY: So, we had a fight.
LANE: You and Dean.
RORY: No, me and my mom.
LANE: Right.
RORY: So then I called him today, and I told him that we need to talk because there were questions and clarifications and many tiny details that were totally ignored, because he's, like, perfect, you know? But I had it all planned out, every word. I was going to be practical, and I was going to be adult, and then --
LANE: Yeah?
RORY: And then he walked in.
LANE: Yeah?
RORY: And he kissed me, and I couldn't think. It was just -- and then we --
LANE: Again?
RORY: Well, once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to duplicate.
LANE: Where?
RORY: What?
LANE: Where did you do it the second time?
RORY: At Miss Patty's.
LANE: You did it at Miss Patty's?
RORY: Yeah.
LANE: She would be so proud.
RORY: I had it all planned out. I was going to get everything straightened out. Why did he have to walk in like that?
ZACH: [OS] Lane!
LANE: [yells back] In a minute! [takes Rory by the hand]
RORY: Lane.
LANE: Okay, I'm sorry, I just have to ask you. [whispers] How was it?
RORY: Why are you whispering?
LANE: Because I just think that no matter where she is, my mom can hear this conversation.
RORY: It was a little scary.
LANE: Was he nice to you?
RORY: Yeah. It was -- I mean, he loves me, and I love him.
LANE: Oh, my God.
GIL: [OS] Lane! Come on!
[Lane opens her door and enters the front room]
LANE: What?!
GIL: We were supposed to practice a half an hour ago.
ZACH: Brian's been yammering on about germs and spores for 20 minutes. I'm completely freaked out to touch a microphone ever again.
BRIAN: I'm just saying, at the end of the night, who cleans them?
ZACH: Shut up, Brian.
GIL: Look, man, I only have the babysitter till 6:00, then it's my turn to drive them to Gymboree.
ZACH: Dude, you promised you wouldn't talk about the parental issue during band practice.
GIL: We're not having band practice, and it's not a parental issue. It's being part of the cycle of life, and that, my friend, is pure rock 'n' roll.
ZACH: Go join "The Polyphonic Spree," you fruitcake.
BRIAN: I'm just saying my bass strap has a smell.
LANE: Hey! Shut up, all of you! Now, that is my friend, and she is here in desperate need of some girl talk, and in case you haven't noticed, I am a girl, and this, right here, is what it's like to have a girl in the band, so all of you -- deal! [returns to her bedroom] Sorry.
RORY: Lane, I think I did something that -- what do you think?
LANE: Of what?
RORY: Of what I did. I need some perspective.
LANE: From me?
RORY: Yes.
LANE: You need some perspective on sex from me?
RORY: I need some perspective on sex with Dean from you.
LANE: Oh, well, Dean loves you.
RORY: I know.
LANE: And you love him.
RORY: I know.
LANE: So it seems like --
RORY: He's married.
LANE: I know.
RORY: How did I overlook that fact? I mean, he said that the marriage was over. He said that he had told Lindsay or that he was going to tell her or that she already knew somehow, but I didn't ask anything else. Why didn't I ask anything else?
LANE: I don't know.
RORY: I don't remember what he said. I don't remember what he told me. I didn't ask anything important.
LANE: You can ask now.
RORY: I tried to ask now. I ended up having sex on an Al Gilbert record. I need to know some things. I need -- I don't know what I need to do.
LANE: Maybe you should talk to Lorelai.
RORY: No.
LANE: But she already knows about you guys.
RORY: No.
LANE: She's better than me at this sort of thing because she at least has a frame of reference.
RORY: Talking to her is not an option.
LANE: Okay, well, then --
[ Drumsticks clicking. Rock music plays - Lane enters to see Zach behind her drum set]
LANE: What do you think you're doing?!
BRIAN: I told you she'd be mad.
LANE: Get away from my drums!
ZACH: You were in there talking about panty hose or whatever the hell you chicks talk about --
LANE: You do not, under any circumstances, touch my drums.
GIL: He adjusted your seat also.
LANE: You what?!
[CUT TO DRAGONFLY LOBBY AREA]
[Lorelai speaks to one of the maids]
LORELAI: So, make sure they all get the thank-you cards and light the lemon candles so the rooms smell pretty when they get up there. Thanks, and great job this weekend -- great job. [startles when she sees Emily sitting on the sofa] Oh! My God!
EMILY: My, what a lovely greeting.
LORELAI: How long have you been sitting there?
EMILY: Ten minutes. Why?
LORELAI: You scared me.
EMILY: Like I'm Dracula?
LORELAI: Oh, my God, my heart won't stop pounding.
EMILY: Stop being so dramatic. I just showed up for lunch. It's not as if I did anything truly terrifying like telling you that butt-crack-baring jeans had gone out of style.
LORELAI: What do you mean you showed up for lunch?
EMILY: Our lunch...at 1:00. You, me, Rory -- the three of us. We're having lunch, aren't we?
LORELAI: I didn't think so.
EMILY: You didn't?
LORELAI: Well, no, but --
EMILY: When you invited your father and me for the weekend, you said it included a lunch with you and Rory.
LORELAI: Well, yes, I know, but that was before you left.
EMILY: What does my leaving have to do with anything?
LORELAI: Well, when you left, you weren't here anymore. You were gone, so we just assumed lunch was --
EMILY: this lunch was your idea.
LORELAI: Yes, I know, but --
EMILY: I did not force it upon you.
LORELAI: You're right, however --
EMILY: If you were too busy or you didn't want it to happen, then you didn't have to bring it up at all, did you?
LORELAI: No, I didn't, but you left, see, so --
EMILY: All right then. It is now 1:00. You said lunch at 1:00. I'm here. It's 1:00. I'm hungry. Where's Rory?
LORELAI: Okay, see, you left, so -
EMILY: She's not here, is she?
LORELAI: No.
EMILY: Didn't she know about the lunch?
LORELAI: Yes, mom, she knew about the lunch, but you -- so we -- and she -- I'll call her.
EMILY: I'll wait. [walks off]
[CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT BEDROOM]
[Rory sits alone on Lane's bed listening to arguing voices in next room]
LANE: [OS] What are you doing?! [unintelligible dialog]
[Rory's cell phone rings from her purse. She walks over to answer it.]
LANE: [OS] What are you talking about?
ZACH: [OS] We're a band! We share!
RORY: Hello?
LORELAI: Your grandmother is here for her lunch. [Scene switches between inn and the bedroom]
RORY: But she left.
LORELAI: Could you just get back here?
RORY: I'm kind of busy.
LORELAI: Rory, this is not for me, okay? This is for your grandmother. You like your grandmother, remember?
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Great.
RORY: Bye.
LANE: [OS yelling ]
ZACH: [OS] Chill!
GIL: [OS] You're worse than Metallica!
[CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK]
[Rory is walking to return to the inn. She passes the butcher and notices Lindsay inside talking animatedly. Curious, she returns to eavesdrop.]
LINDSAY: I did that.
BUTCHER: Did you put in the meat thermometer?
LINDSAY: Yes, I put in the meat thermometer. I put in three meat thermometers just in case one of them wasn't working.
BUTCHER: And you put the oven on 450 for 20 minutes and then lowered it to 350 for the last hour.
LINDSAY: [upset] I did everything you told me. I did it exactly like you told me to, and it still turned out awful.
BUTCHER: Maybe you should try something else -- meatloaf or chicken.
LINDSAY: No, Dean likes roast beef! We had it at our wedding. His mother makes it every time we go over there. I'm making dinner tonight, and it has to be perfect, so just tell me how to do it again.
BUTCHER: Okay.
LINDSAY: And write it down.
BUTCHER: Okay. First, you rub it with a little oil. Then take some fresh ground...
[Rory walks away]
[CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN - OUTSIDE IN THE BACK OF THE PATIO AREA]
[Emily, Lorelai and Rory sit at a small round table. A waiter finishes filling Emily's beverage and leaves. No one speaks.]
[ Birds chirping ]
[ Horse neighs ]
EMILY: The weather's lovely.
LORELAI: Yes, it is.
EMILY: Rory, don't you think it's lovely?
RORY: It's very lovely.
EMILY: Yes. [looks at her surroundings] Lovely. Well, I don't see any reason to put this off any longer. Girls, I have something to say that may shock you, but unfortunately there's nothing I can do about that now. Lorelai, Rory, Richard and I have separated.
LORELAI: And?
EMILY: What do you mean "and"? That's not enough? You need some sort of mob-related offing to make it interesting?
LORELAI: No, Mom, that's plenty. It's just, we already knew.
EMILY: Rory didn't.
RORY: Well, I mean, I didn't know know --
EMILY: Why would you tell her?
LORELAI: Mom!
EMILY: Who else did you tell?
LORELAI: [sarcasm] So, you haven't read "Page Six"?
EMILY: Rory, if you need to talk about this to try to understand why this is happening, then by all means, do not ask your mother.
LORELAI: Okay, Mom, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be insensitive. It just seemed like a thing you and Dad were going through. I figured you'd make up.
EMILY: Well, we didn't.
LORELAI: I see that. So, wow, you're really separated?
EMILY: That's right. Your father's moving into the pool house.
LORELAI: So then you're not separated.
EMILY: Of course we are.
LORELAI: You're separated by the pool.
EMILY: That's it. That's the end of your input on this.
RORY: I'm sorry, Grandma.
EMILY: Well, what's done is done. I'm moving on. And to celebrate the next stage of my life, I'm going to Europe by myself for the very first time since I was in college. I'm leaving tonight.
RORY: Tonight? That's fast.
EMILY: Well, I wanted to leave quickly, so I called my travel agent and insisted that he put me on tonight's plane to Paris no matter what. He finally managed to bump someone from a church group, and I've got my seat, and I'm leaving at 10:00. And, Rory, my offer to you still stands.
RORY: What offer?
EMILY: My offer to escort you around Europe this summer.
RORY: Oh. [Lorelai watches Rory's reaction carefully]
EMILY: Every young lady should do Europe the proper way at least once in her life, and I would be thrilled to have your company on this very special occasion. Of course, I know it's very short notice, so if you already have plans for the summer, I completely understand.
LORELAI: You know, I think Europe sounds great. I think you would really enjoy that. I mean, remember -- we loved Paris. You don't have anything special planned for the summer, do you?
RORY: [gives Lorelai an odd look] No, nothing special.
EMILY: Well, then? What do you say? Would you like to be impulsive with me?
RORY: Sure, Grandma, I'd love to.
EMILY: That is just wonderful! I'll call Ralphie right away and tell him to bump another Baptist. We'll have a wonderful time, you and I. It'll be just like "Gigi." Lorelai, I'm gonna use your phone.
LORELAI: Be my guest, Mom. [Emily exits. Long pause] Europe? Cool. [Rory give Lorelai a cool look] What?
RORY: So, what is this, a Henry James novel? The young lady acts up, and her family ships her off to Europe?
LORELAI: Oh, come on.
RORY: How fast did you tell Grandma that I had nothing to do this summer?
LORELAI: I'm not shipping you off.
RORY: Oh, please!
LORELAI: I'm not. I'm just -- okay, maybe I am.
RORY: Ha!
LORELAI: I wasn't planning on it, but maybe in the back of my mind, I just thought -
RORY: - Say Goodbye to Daisy Miller.
LORELAI: Okay, fine, so maybe I suggested the trip to give you some time to --
RORY: Travel back to the turn of the century?
LORELAI: To think -- but you did not have to accept.
RORY: I did too.
LORELAI: No, Rory, you didn't. You're 19 now, remember? You're all grown up, and you can handle your own affairs. Sorry. That's a bad choice of words. You can handle your own life events, so if you didn't want to go to Europe, all you had to do was say you didn't want to go, but you didn't, so I assume you do want to go. [sees Rory's expression] You do want to go? How come? I mean, what about Dean? You're just gonna go off and leave now?
RORY: None of your business.
LORELAI: Did something happen? Did you guys have a fight, or is it something else? Is it Lindsay?
RORY: We didn't have a fight. Everything is fine with Dean. I want to go so I can get away from you.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, weren't you supposed to go through this phase like five years ago? 'Cause, I mean, seriously, at this point, storming into your room and blasting your goth rock -- it's just gonna confuse your roommates.
RORY: [grabs her pocketbook stands to exit] Tell Grandma I had to pack.
["If I Could Write" by Sam Phillips plays over the next three scenes that have no dialogue.]
[CUT TO DEAN AND LINDSAY'S APARTMENT]
[Lindsay enters with platter of roast beef and trimmings. She sets it down in front of Dean and anxiously watches as he begins to carve. Dean glances up at her worried face. She watches closely and jumps in jubilation when she sees the roast is a success. Dean is startled at her shout and smiles as she wraps her arms around his neck to hug and kisses him. She claps her hands and hops up and down as he continues to smile and carve.]

[CUT TO EXTERIOR OF ELDER GILMORE ENTRANCE]
[Chauffeur loads Emily's trunks and luggage into limousine. In the doorway, Emily gives last minute instructions to maid and departs. Front door closes while Richard appears in the interior distance lighting his cigar.]
[CUT TO LORELAI'S STAIRWELL]
[Lorelai appears at the top of the stairs as a cell phone rings below. Rory appears and checks the caller id as it rings. She ignores the call, turns off the phone, tucks it in her purse, and returns to her room. Lorelai slowly descends the stairs with a concerned look.]
[AIRPORT DEPARTING GATE]
[Emily hurries along the walkway]
EMILY: Come on, girls, hurry up. We have an adventure to embark on. [happily approaches the attendant] There you go -- my picture I.D. And my boarding pass. Rory, hurry up. You have to hold your own boarding pass, and you need your I.D. Lorelai, say your good byes here. If you don't have a boarding pass, you can't go farther -- am I right? [confirms with the attendant] I'm right, Lorelai. If you need to search me, that's just fine. Don't be afraid to ask. Bye, Lorelai. [exits to gate]
LORELAI: Bye, Mom. [then to Rory] Hey, hey, hold on a sec. You have everything you need?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: You have trashy-magazine money?
RORY: Those magazines make Grandma crazy.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, here's 20 bucks. It's a long flight.
EMILY: Rory, hurry, please!
RORY: Coming, Grandma. I have to go.
LORELAI: Yeah, you do. Okay, so, um... have fun, and uh... if you need to talk about anything, just please call me, okay?
RORY: Okay. [uncomfortable moment before she exits. Lorelai sadly watches her depart]
[CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT]
[Lorelai enters to the house. Looks around feeling sad and lonely. She notices message machine is blinking as she drops her keys on desk. She presses playback button, and answering machine beeps. She sits as the message plays.]
LUKE'S VOICE: Hey, it's me. Uh, listen, I got a call from my sister and T.J. They're up in Maine, and they got into a little accident -- nothing major, just each one of them broke an arm and a leg, [Lorelai looks concerned] so anyhow, they can't run the Renaissance Fair booth for a couple of weeks. So they asked me to come and help them out, and I, unfortunately, answered the phone, so I'm on my way to Maine. I'll be back in about a week. Okay? Bye.
LORELAI: Great.
[ Beeps ]
LUKE'S VOICE: Hey, it's me again. I'm not sure if we're at the point in this relationship where you actually need to know that much information about my whereabouts, [Lorelai smiles and chuckles] so if we're not, I'm sorry. I could have just said, "I'm going out of town, and I'll call you later." So I'm going out of town, and I'll call you later.
[ Beeps ]
LUKE'S VOICE: Me again, [Lorelai look of disbelief] the idiot that leaves you three rambling messages on your machine. I just wanted to tell you I got a cell phone before I left, so, you know, you could call if you want, but only if you want, so that's it.
LORELAI: Ah! [frustrated as she prepared to write down number]
[ Beeps ]
LUKE'S VOICE: Yeah, a number might be good.
LORELAI: Thank you. [writes number on paper]
LUKE'S VOICE: 860-294-1986. Okay, bye.
[ Beeps ]
LUKE'S VOICE: Just...don't change your mind until I get back, okay? Okay. Talk to you later.
[ Beeps ]
[After only a few moments she picks up phone and dials number from paper and sits on sofa. Ringing cell phone. ]
LUKE'S VOICE: Hello?
LORELAI: Well, if it isn't Dean Moriarty.
[CUT TO INTERSTATE ROAD - LUKE'S TRUCK - NIGHT]
[Scene switches between Luke's truck and Lorelai's sofa]
LUKE: Yeah, this is the life.
LORELAI: So, are Liz and T.J. okay?
LUKE: Yeah, they're just not getting around too well. Liz is all panicked that if they don't finish out the season, they're gonna lose their spot next to the apple doll booth, which is apparently the prime spot, so I said I'd help them out.
LORELAI: Very chivalrous of you.
LUKE: Yeah, I'm a regular Lancelot. So, you get my messages?
LORELAI: Oh, no, did you leave a message? Sorry, my answering machine dropped dead of exhaustion. What did you say?
LUKE: Not much.
LORELAI: Okay.
LUKE: So...
LORELAI: So...
LUKE: That was a hell of a test run.
LORELAI: You mean for the inn, of course.
LUKE: Of course.
LORELAI: Yes, it was. Although, you know, until you have a successful second go-round, you really don't know if everything's gonna work.
LUKE: Then I guess there's got to be a second go-round. [smiles]
LORELAI: Well, yes, it's the only thing that makes really good business sense. So, where are you right now?
LUKE: About 10 minutes from "if I lived here, I'd blow my brains out."
LORELAI: Ah, yes, I hear it's lovely there this time of year.

OPEN TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK
[Lorelai walks very quickly down the sidewalk passing some of the vendor stands]
LORELAI: Morning, Al. Morning, Fred. Morning, Sam.
[She drops envelope in a corner nailbox and continues past a man handing out pamphlets.]
MAN: Cider Mill's opening Saturday. Big parade and free cider for one and all.
LORELAI: Thank you. [Never slowing her pace, she takes the offered paper and quickly hands it out to the next person she passes.] Cider mill's opening Saturday. Big parade and free cider for one and all.
WOMAN: Thank you.
[Lorelai approaches Miss Patty's dance studio where Patty is instructing several small dancing apples.]
PATTY: Keep it going, kids. You're red, you're delicious. You're about to have the juice sucked out of you. [She smiles as Lorelai passes] There she is -- our spunky entrepreneur.
LORELAI: I am the uber-Trump-Murdoch-Maximus. [She glances back] Oop. Apple down.
PATTY: Apple down. [pauses before reacting] Apple down! Hold it, everybody! Apple down! Okay, roll her over. [calls after the rapidly disappearing Lorelai] Have a nice day.
MAN: [OS, continues to call out] Big parade, free cider for one and all.
[OPEN TO LUKE'S DINER]
[Lane is standing behind counter taking a food order from a woman]
LANE: …and two eggs over easy, got it. Just be a couple minutes. [tears order from her pad and places it on the kitchen ledge] Caesar, order.
[Lane smoothly walks around the counter, passing Zach and Brian sitting at a corner table.]
BRIAN: Since they were both actually royalty, their child would have a real claim to the Judean throne, see? So Mary Magdalene goes to Gaul to have the kid. She's also supposed to run the church after his death, but that's not what Peter wants, right? But all that got covered up later by Constantine after the council of Nicea purged the Christian --
ZACH: Oh, my god! Will you stop talking about this!
BRIAN: This is, like, the number-one book in the country.
ZACH: Well, it's my number-one bummer.
[Lane approaches]
LANE: Okay, guys, what'll you have?
ZACH: Burger for me -- nothing healthy on it, extra cheese -- and, of course, an order of...wink-winkers.
LANE: [slightly annoyed] You don't have to call them that, Zach.
ZACH: Just want to make myself clear.
LANE: Look, I told you guys I'd throw you free fries -- not a big deal since they're usually the ones we wind up throwing out anyway from making too many, which means you don't have to call them wink-winkers or nudge-nudgies or know-what-I-meanies or anything else in verbal code, especially if it's cute-cutesy.
ZACH: I will abide by that.
LANE: Brian?
BRIAN: Same thing -- burger and fries. [wiggles eyebrows knowingly]
ZACH: Dude, that's cute-cutesy.
BRIAN: She said not to be verbally cute-cutesy.
ZACH: It was a blanket moratorium on anything cutesy concerning the fries.
LANE: I'll be back. [walks away]
ZACH: Cokes, too.
BRIAN: Better get my money ready. [pulls hands full of loose change onto the table]
ZACH: That's not embarrassing.
[Lorelai enters the diner and greets Lane]
LORELAI: Hi, Lane.
LANE: Lorelai, hi. Would you like your usual to go?
LORELAI: Yes, and quick-quick, please.
LANE: [picks up coffee pot] You know, people are calling you "the blur."
LORELAI: That's mean. Or is it? What is that?
LANE: [pours coffee into a To-Go cup] You're not around, and you're always running -- swoosh, blur.
LORELAI: Well, that's business, baby. If you slow down, they might catch up with you. [glances around] Still no Luke, huh?
LANE: Liz and T.J. are still not back up on their feet. Luke's calling the Renaissance Faire his "Vietnam without all the fun sh**ting." [hands Lorelai her cup]
LORELAI: Oh, poor guy.
LANE: I made it extra strong. It should blacken your teeth and rot your stomach. [continues working]
LORELAI: Bless you. [glances at a chain of colorful postcards on the nearby bulletin board]
LANE: [appears] All from Rory.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. Just being nosey.
LANE: No, go ahead, read. I'm sure it's stuff she already told you.
LORELAI: [adds cream to her coffee] Yeah, probably.
LANE: [hands Lorelai a small sack] You are ready to swoosh.
LORELAI: The blur is off. [gathers items and begins to leave]
LANE: And don't overtip.
LORELAI: Try and stop me. [sneaks some dollar bills on the counter as she quickly passes]
LORELAI: Hey, guys.
ZACH: Hey, Lorelai. Get yourself a wink-winker?
LORELAI: What?
LANE: Please erase this from your brain. [sets plate of fries on Zach and Brian's table as she passes]
LORELAI: I will definitely try.
[CUT TO RENAISSANCE FAIRE - LIZ AND T.J.'S BOOTH]
[Liz talks to two fellow Renaissance Faire merchants dressed in period costumes]
LIZ: I'm telling you, I was going crazy. I was in pain for six weeks. It was fractured in three places. That's why it took so long to heal. But thank God for my big brother. [ Women giggling as Luke passes]
HENRY: Morning, Lucas. [approaches carrying large box]
LUKE: Hey, Henry. How's your beard?
HENRY: [ Laughs ] You always ask that, and I always laugh.
LUKE: Well, it's our thing.
HENRY: Hey, come here. Got some dish. [motions Luke to come closer] You know Hay Bale Bill, the guy that totes the hay bales?
LUKE: I seen him around.
HENRY: Got caught in a tent last night with Annie from the grog booth.
LUKE: Hm. Isn't she engaged to the fruit-ice guy?
HENRY: Yeah, and the fruit-ice guy comes back, and there's Annie and Hay Bale, so he tears the tent to pieces.
LUKE: Hm.
HENRY: Now the grog people have to hide her. They set up a fort made out of kegs.
LUKE: [intrigued] Crazy stuff.
HENRY: I'll keep you posted. [exits]
LUKE: All right. See you later.
[Luke pulls necklace merchandise from a box and drapes each on wooden display branches. T.J., in full costume, reclines nearby, arm in a sling - blanket in his lap.]
T.J.: Luuuuuuuke?
LUKE: What, T.J.?
T.J.: You're putting the pewter next to the turquoise?
LUKE: Looks like it.
T.J.: We don't usually put the pewter next to the turquoise.
LUKE: Well, I'm a maverick.
T.J.: Mm-hmm. [ Slurps from his t*nk] Ahh. Might be why the pewter ain't moving.
LUKE: Pewter's moving just fine, T.J.
[Woman dressed in period garb approaches Luke]
WOMAN: Excuse me?
LUKE: Oh, hi, there. Can I help you?
WOMAN: Yeah. I'm looking for the Shakespeare stage.
LUKE: Okay, uh, you walk past the Calumba booth, veer right at the drinking horns, then left at the antler ark.
WOMAN: Thank you. [thankful look then leaves]
LUKE: Mm-hmm.
[Walks around booth to organize table items]
T.J.: Luuuuuke?
LUKE: [strained patience] What, T.J.?
T.J.: You didn't use the approved Faire language with that customer.
LUKE: Maverick -- me. Don't forget that.
T.J.: There's undercover Faire officials walking around. They look for that kind of stuff
LUKE: Well, they should get real jobs.
T.J.: Would it k*ll you to sh**t her a "Good-morrow"?
LUKE: Look, T.J. -- [approaches T.J.'s chaise and hears baseball announcer sounds coming from beneath T.J. lap blanket. He snatches away the cover to reveal a very small television set] I don't believe it.
T.J.: [feigns innocence] I know. The Yanks went with Mussina. They should have gone with Brown.
LUKE: You're watching T.V.!
T.J.: I'm not ready for my nap.
LUKE: You're milking it.
T.J.: I'm convalescing.
LUKE: And you're milking me. But no more. Find some help, get a crutch, because by week's end, I'm gone.
T.J.: Liz, you hearing this?
LIZ: What? [pulls ear phones out of her ears] I'm sorry. I was listening to my Deepak Chopra.
LUKE: I got things to do. I got a business, hopefully a life.
[people in costume walk by, noticing the disturbance]
T.J.: Uh, prithee, you jest, good sir, and leave us short of hand?
LUKE: I ain't jesting.
T.J.: But my arm!
LUKE: Had no trouble reaching into a tub of caramel corn last night while you were scratching yourself with the other. Your dexterity's fine.
LIZ: [resigned] T.J., It's time for him to go.
T.J.: [attempting to instill guilt] So, you're gonna break up the team?
LUKE: I'm no good to you. I'm not moving the pewter. [walks off… then returns and grabs the little television] Don't want you to get in trouble with the undercover squad.
[CUT TO ITALY - LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE]
[The Concierge enters followed by Emily, Rory and a plethora of bellhops with vast amounts of luggage.]
CONCIERGE LUCIANO: Hallo, and here we are -- room 518. A beautiful room -- very special for you, Mrs. Gilmore.
RORY: It's nice.
EMILY: It's hot.
LUCIANO: [quickly reacts to assist] I will adjust the air for you. No problem on my end. [watches Emily walk to the balcony opening to observe the view] It's a spectacular view. Very nice. A little balcony there.
EMILY: [frowns] It's different.
LUCIANO: Something is different?
EMILY: The view -- it's different.
RORY: [Rory and Luciano join Emily at the balcony wall] Wow. It's pretty spectacular.
EMILY: It's not the same.
LUCIANO: It's the same room you had two years ago, Signora -- 518.
EMILY: The ruins -- they used to be closer. Something move?
LUCIANO: I don't think so.
EMILY: That pillar is in a different place.
RORY: I think the ruins are probably where they've been for the past 2,000 years, Grandma.
LUCIANO: We can get you another room, signora. No problem.
EMILY: No, no, it's fine. [returns to the main room, pauses then frowns] Smokers.
LUCIANO: I despise smokers.
[Rory shuffles through the luggage cart valet]
EMILY: Rory, I told you before, you do not move luggage.
LUCIANO: Yes, yes, please. We will do that.
RORY: Sorry.
EMILY: Your high tea is still at the same time?
LUCIANO: Si, signora.
EMILY: We'll need to book some private tours -- the Vatican, the Villa Medici. And private -- just the two of us. The concierge in Florence stuck us with a Belgian couple at the Uffizi who didn't know a fresco from a ferret hole. And the ruins, of course. Make sure the guide's not too dry. [absently gazes out the patio window] So different. [quickly follows a luggage-laden bell hop another room] The hanging bags should be hung, not laid on the bed.
RORY: Excuse me. How far away are we from the catacombs?
LUCIANO: Close, but your grandmother would not like the catacombs. Bones disturb her.
RORY: It's for me. My grandmother usually takes a nap this time of day, so I go off and do my own thing.
LUCIANO: [wistful look] Ah, yes, a nap.
[Emily briskly returns to the main room]
EMILY: We need two more pillows.
LUCIANO: I will see to it. Anything else I can do?
EMILY: That should do it. Thank you, Luciano.
RORY: Yeah, thank you very much.
LUCIANO: Grazie mille. Buona notte. Good evening. Thank you. [exits]
EMILY: Let's sit down and pick our restaurants. That's three nights -- that's three lunches and three dinners. We'll take our usual passeggiata around the piazza navana, but let's pick the restaurants. [enthusiastically riffles through the brochures]
RORY: Do you want to pick them before your nap or after?
EMILY: I'm skipping my nap today.
RORY: Oh, really? [Disappointed, she joins her grandmother on the sofa.]
EMILY: Absolutely. I'm not the least bit tired. [covertly watches Rory's reaction]
RORY: Oh, good.
EMILY: Couldn't hide it any better than that, huh?
RORY: Hide what?
EMILY: I don't take my nap, you don't get to go out on your own.
RORY: Oh...[ Scoffs ] Grandma, I wasn't thinking that.
EMILY: Well, I was kidding. I'm exhausted. I'm not sure I'll even make it to the bedroom. I may just drop down here on the carpet.
RORY: Thank you, Grandma. It's all cultural stuff, I promise. Just kind of faster and funkier.
EMILY: Well, go enjoy your funk.
RORY: Thank you. [kisses Emily's cheek]
EMILY: Mm-hmm. [Rory walks over to the luggage cart] Say, when was the last time we called your mother?
RORY: Not sure. [shifts the shoulder strap of a leather tourist bag over her shoulder]
EMILY: Have we called her this week?
RORY: I think you did.
EMILY: We'll call when you come back.
RORY: Okay. Bye. [exits]
EMILY: Bye-bye. [calls after her and continues to read brochures]
[CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN - INTERIOR ENTRY]
[Lorelai briskly enters as a male guest crosses her path]
MALE GUEST: 'Morning.
LORELAI: 'Morning. [crosses over to reception desk]
ROB: Morning.
LORELAI: Oh hey Rob, I want to keep these brochures nice and neat in the rack here, none of them askew. Otherwise, it gives the place that "we'll leave the light on for you" feel that we're desperately trying to avoid.
ROB: Yeah, I checked it. [watches her shuffle the papers inside the display box]
LORELAI: That is, if we ultimately decide that we don't mind having brochures here in the lobby. The jury's still out on that. [very brief pause] You know what? Jury's back. Brochures are out. [picks of the wooden box] I'll just take this in the office and... [spies a figure crouching behind the reception desk] Michel...
MICHEL: Good morning.
LORELAI: Um, what are you doing? [impatient]
MICHEL: Hiding.
LORELAI: From me?
MICHEL: No.
LORELAI: From?
MICHEL: Suffice to say, my hiding is not costing the inn any income. In fact, I'm overdue for my 10. So consider this my 10, and you are now conducting business with an employee who is officially on his 10, which is in direct violation of union rules.
LORELAI: You're not in a union.
MICHEL: I'm in a union of oppressed Frenchmen.
LORELAI: Oh, the U.O.F. -- Got it. All right. Carry on.
[ Sighs, then quickly walks to the next room and interrupts a maid dusting ]
LORELAI: Oh, hey, there is a spot on the floor over here that the vacuum never quite reaches. Let's make sure it does. Thank you. [briskly continues walking though the inn. A family of four approaches Lorelai.] Hi. It's the Krumholtzes. How are you doing today?
MR. KRUMHOLTZ: Great. Are you always here?
LORELAI: I give that illusion. So, what's on the agenda today?
MRS. KRUMHOLTZ: Mike and I would love to hit some antique stores.
LORELAI: We can guide you to the best of them.
MR. KRUMHOLTZ: But the kids would love to stay here. You got games and books, and they'd be bored stiff with us.
LORELAI: They can absolutely stay here. There's always people around.
MRS. KRUMHOLTZ: Is Michel going to be here?
LORELAI: [sympathetic look] Yes.
MRS. KRUMHOLTZ: Oh, good. He is their favorite.
LORELAI: [disbelief] Michel? Have they met Michel? [to the children] Have you met Michel?
LITTLE GIRL: He's funny!
LITTLE BOY: Yeah!
MR. KRUMHOLTZ: They love him. He chases them around and shouts and pretends to be mad, and they laugh and laugh.
LORELAI: Well, Michel is here, and I'm sure he would be happy to look after you guys while your parents are gone. In fact, he's playing hide-and-seek right now, and if you go over to the reception area, I guarantee you'll be getting warm, warmer, hot.
LITTLE BOY: Goodie! Let's go! Come on!
LITTLE GIRL: [giggles]
LORELAI: Have a good day. [enters dining room and picks up a coffee pot on nearby table.] Morning! Who needs coffee? Oh, I'll get you some coffee right there. [a waiter approaches and takes pot from Lorelai.] Oh, hey, when Sookie gets in, tell her I want to go over the layout for the dinner menu. I want to go another way. I'll be in my office. Thank you. [busily walks off]
[Lorelai circles back to front lobby and sees Michel attached to two young children] Hey, you found him. Good job, Krumholtzes.
LITTLE BOY: [gleefully] He grounded us and told us to go do something to ourselves.
LITTLE GIRL: [grins] He used a dirty word.
MICHEL: And I'm destined to use many more.
LORELAI: No, you're not. Come here. [grabs and drags Michel aside by his lapel]
MICHEL: It is not my job to entertain little people.
LORELAI: Michel, the Krumholtzes are in our most expensive room. We need people like them to be happy so they tell other people like them they we're happy - because we are a new business, and we all have to go above and beyond the call of duty until we are established.
MICHEL: So you watch them.
LORELAI: I hate kids.
MICHEL: This isn't fair.
LORELAI: You're a profit participant. Happy Krumholtzes equal lots of profits, participant. [physically turns him around and approach the children]
MICHEL: [fake charm] Who wants to play some insipid board game with me?
LITTLE GIRL: We want to play an insipid board game!
LITTLE BOY: Yeah! [running off] Let's play Chinese checkers!
[Lorelai climbs stairs as her cellular phone rings ]
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: [loudly] Lorelai, it's your mother!
LORELAI: Hi, Mom.
EMILY: [loudly] I'm calling from Rome!
LORELAI: The line is crystal clear. You don't have to yell.
EMILY: Sorry -- I still think transcontinental calls are a bigger deal than they are.
LORELAI: You're coming in fine. So, Rome?
EMILY: Our last stop, and a good thing, too, because I don't know how long I can keep these randy European men off me.
LORELAI: Excuse me? [enters a room scrutinizing everything while maid puts fresh sheets on bed]
EMILY: They're terrible flirts here. Gorgeous, but so forward. Do you want to talk to Rory?
LORELAI: [unenthusiastically] Oh, um, sure. Is she there? [shoos away a maid and takes sheet herself. Maid looks unhappy.]
EMILY: Yes, she is. Hang on. Rory!
RORY: Hello?
LORELAI'S VOICE: [attempts cheer] Hi.
RORY: Hi.
LORELAI: So, Rome? [struggles with sheet while pinning cell phone between shoulder and ear]
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Weather good?
RORY: Hot in the day, cooler at night.
LORELAI: Uh-huh, that's kind of what we're having here.
RORY: Huh. Coinky-dink.
LORELAI: Yeah. So...
RORY: So...
LORELAI: Um, I guess I'll be seeing you in a couple of days. [attempts to smooth sheet unsuccessfully]
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Great, then. Be safe, and watch out for those Italian men, especially the ones named Randy.
RORY: I will. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye. [angrily yanks off flat sheet] Didn't look like a quarter would bounce off it. [hands sheet to the confused maid and hurries off] Got to have those bouncing quarters.
[CUT TO ITALIAN SIDEWALK CAFÉ]
[Emily and Rory carry shopping packages as they select an empty table]
EMILY: I think the pink purse with the gold clasp is my favorite.
RORY: We probably could have gotten all this stuff at home, Grandma. Now we have to pay duty on them.
EMILY: But if you buy them back in the States, then you can't say, "I picked this up in Rome." [young Italian waiter approaches]
WAITER: Buon giorno. Hello. May I help you, please?
EMILY: Buon giorno. [ Speaking Italian ]
WAITER: Ah, la bellissima signora parlo italiano molto bene.
EMILY: [extremely pleased as she sits] Grazie. He called me "pretty lady." It just never stops.
RORY: [still standing and looking around] You got the gams, Grandma.
EMILY: [ Conversing with the waiter in Italian then - ] Rory? Rory?
RORY: [distracted] Huh?
EMILY: What do you want?
RORY: Oh. A triple espresso. [She sits down with Emily.]
EMILY: [ Speaking Italian ]
WAITER: [ Speaking Italian ] Si, signora.
EMILY: [ Chuckles ] He won't stop.
WAITER: [ Continues speaking Italian ]
EMILY: [ Laughing ]
[CUT TO LUKE'S DINER]
[Lane, Zach, and Brian are seated at a table discussing their set lists]
ZACH: The fact is, we've got five original songs ready to play live. A 40-minute gig means we can fill it out with six or seven covers.
LANE: No problem.
ZACH: Problem. Our covers are tight and people dig 'em. We play "Fell in Love With a Girl" as good as the White Stripes, so how is one of our originals gonna stack up coming after it?
BRIAN: We could play all our originals up top, then close with our covers.
ZACH: That's asymmetrical, and we could lose our audience if we play a bunch of originals in a row.
BRIAN: Our covers are just too good.
ZACH: I say we cut any cover song that overpowers our originals.
BRIAN: So no "Suffragette City."
ZACH: And no White Stripes. "Lithium" is gone, the Radiohead, both Pixies.
BRIAN: No Dandy Warhols. [Lane stares at them both]
ZACH: Or Velvet Underground.
LANE: Wait, guys. You're cutting every good cover song we play.
ZACH: But maybe that's the key. Yeah, yeah -- if we play nothing but crappy covers, our originals will stand out.
BRIAN: Brilliant.
LANE: [incredulous] What?!
ZACH: Anything by Men At Work.
BRIAN: Or Chicago, Wings.
ZACH: Styx.
BRIAN: Culture Club.
ZACH: We throw in a Quarterflash, they'll be eating out of our hands.
LANE: Okay, this is just kooky. Now, I say we reconvene tonight and figure it out then.
BRIAN: I got to get to work, anyway.
LANE: I'll see you at home tonight.
[Brian puts on bicycle helmet and leaves. Zach begins to follow, while Lane resumes work]
LANE: [to customer at counter] I'll get you some more water?
[ Bells jingles and the two female groupies, Trina and Cheryl enter ]
ZACH: Well, hello.
CHERYL: Hey, there.
TRINA: Hi, Zach.
ZACH: Trina, how you doing? [kisses her cheek] Cheryl, come on. sh**t me some. [Cheryl kisses his cheek, while Lane watches, disgusted] Come this way. You sit there. I want you to sit right here.
[CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN ]
[Michel sits across a Chinese Checkers board from the Krumholtz kids]
LITTLE BOY: It's your turn.
MICHEL: Really? That fact has not changed since you said it 10 seconds ago?
[ Both children giggle ]
LITTLE GIRL: If you lose, will you do that thing where you pretend to get all mad and you hit the board and send the marbles flying all around?
LITTLE BOY: Yeah!
MICHEL: [surly] I am not going to lose.
LORELAI: [enters] Hi, kids. Michel, do we have any double-A batteries?
MICHEL: How can a man play Chinese Checkers with all these interruptions?
LORELAI: [distractedly spies a distant spot on the carpet] Ugh! Man, they're still not vacuuming that spot.
LITTLE BOY: It's your turn, Michel.
MICHEL: [moves his checker piece] Redundant little rodent.
LORELAI: Michel, the batteries?
MICHEL: In the office -- far-right drawer of the credenza. [the boy triple jumps over Michel's game pieces] Damn!
LORELAI: [quickly interjects to the children] - Is where water is stored to power electrical facilities. Thanks Michel. [glances to next room]
LITTLE BOY: It's your turn again.
MICHEL: Grr.
LORELAI: Why are the dining room tables always, always out of place? [ Sighs ]
[She struggles to shift one of the dining tables, while Sookie notices from another table ]
SOOKEI: Lorelai? [to patrons] Excuse me. [She hurries over to stop Lorelai's struggling tugs as the glassware almost topples. To Lorelai] Okay, okay. Table's perfect now.
LORELAI: Who keeps moving them out of place? I want a name.
SOOKIE: Uh, cruel, sadistic table fairies? Come into the pantry with me, here.
LORELAI: I can give you a minute. That's it. -- Ooh.
[She smoothly yanks an empty plate from a diner's place then joins Sookie]
SOOKIE: I've been trying to figure out a way to bring this up -- what's that? [notices the plate in Lorelai's hand]
LORELAI: I cleared a plate.
SOOKIE: You don't clear plates.
LORELAI: The plate was empty, so I grabbed it.
SOOKIE: Give me the plate. You've gone nutty!
LORELAI: What?!
SOOKIE: Now you're mad. I hate making you mad. I have the worst people k*ll.
LORELAI: I'm not mad or nutty.
SOOKIE: But you are, and you have been for weeks. The nutty don't usually know that they're nutty, thus the nutty.
LORELAI: Sookie, I'm very busy.
SOOKIE: Doing other people's work.
LORELAI: I am not.
SOOKIE: It's your job to change sheets, fluff pillows?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Brush the horses, fold the points on the toilet paper?
LORELAI: Sookie, we're breaking in new people. I'm picking up the slack.
SOOKIE: I'm new? Michel's new?
LORELAI: I'm not doing your jobs. [picks up nearby napkins and carefully folds each while listening]
SOOKIE: Two weeks ago, I come in, and my refrigerator, which is sorted by a system that I have honed for 10 straight years, is completely rearranged. The beets are on the top. The vegetables are on the bottom. It's "Apocalypse Now," baby! I yelled at the staff, but now I know. It was you. [pulls the folded linens from Lorelai's hands]
LORELAI: It was messy.
SOOKIE: It was my messy. I couldn't find anything in there for days. I kept reaching in for strawberries and coming up with liver -- that's not pleasant.
LORELAI: I promise not to touch the fridge again.
SOOKIE: You're yelling at the employees. You never yelled before.
LORELAI: I'm yelling?
SOOKIE: And you've got to go home once in a while.
LORELAI: Sookie, we're a new business. It's time-consuming.
SOOKIE: How many times have you fallen asleep at your desk in that stupid office of yours?
LORELAI: Once.
SOOKIE: No. Once, you fell asleep on a stapler. The whole next day, you had "Swingline" printed backwards across your face. But you've fallen asleep at that desk a hundred times.
LORELAI: Well, I'm here when I'm here. I can't change that. I'm sorry.
SOOKIE: Want to know the last time I saw staff and maids looking this scared of their boss? Your mother's house.
LORELAI: [hurt] Ow! Knife in the gut!
SOOKIE: Well, I'm sorry to deal from the bottom of the deck, but that's reality.
LORELAI: [sad look] Well... I am pretty b*rned out.
SOOKIE: Me too. We all are. It's been hard.
LORELAI: I will take a break.
SOOKIE: Good.
LORELAI: Not this week, 'cause stuff's been piling up. But... [pause] not next week. God. I don't know.
SOOKIE: Now. [Pulls Lorelai around and pushes from the room to the entry hall]
LORELAI: Uh-oh. Hey, stop! Wait, I'm being kidnapped!
SOOKIE: Go home and relax.
LORELAI: I have no one to hang out with.
SOOKIE: I'll hang out with you sometime this week. I need a break, too. We'll have a girlfriend day. We'll get manicures and jump rope and talk about boys. The whole cliché thing. Now go! [Lorelai pauses] Go and don't stop for nothing.
LORELAI: Okay, okay, I promise.
[Crash sounds and game pieces fly across the room]
MICHEL: [OS] Aaaah!
KRUMHOLTZ KIDS: [OS] Do it again! Do it again!
[Lorelai cringes]
SOOKIE: Hold it. [Lorelai flinches] Hold it! Good girl. Now, get your things and go.
[Lorelai holds up a hand to cover her view of the mess exits in a hurry. Sookie peeks in the next room, shakes her head and returns to the kitchen.]
[CUT TO DRAGONFLY FRONT PORCH
[Lorelai stands on the doorway and notices the gardener potting plants on the porch]
LORELAI: [ Sighs ] Oh, hey. Um, Bob, are you sure you want to - nope. Keep going. [He nods and continues. Her cellular phone rings, she removes it from her purse and answers ] Hello?
[The scene switches from Italy to the Dragonfly Inn]
RORY: [calling from her Italian hotel room] It's me.
LORELAI: [clipped tone] Oh. Hello.
RORY: Bad time? Are you busy?
LORELAI: Uh, trying not to be. How are you doing?
RORY: Good. You?
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: [After a long pause, she speaks hesitatingly ] I was at the corner of Bark and Cheese today.
LORELAI: [smiling with remembrance, she sits on a porch wicker chair] Bark and Cheese? Really?
RORY: And it's exactly the same.
LORELAI: Exactly the same? Was there a tiny, little Italian dog in a basket barking the whole time you were there?
RORY: Not this time, but I definitely had flashbacks.
LORELAI: Did you have a nice piece of cheese with your coffee?
RORY: I still say I said the correct word for "cream" in Italian. I even pointed at my coffee when I asked for it. How could I be asking for cheese?
LORELAI: But cheese you were brought.
RORY: Stinky cheese. The worst, don't forget.
LORELAI: That you proceeded to eat.
RORY: Because I hate people who make mistakes when they order, especially in a foreign country, and then make a big to-do when they get the wrong thing. Ugly Americans. Yuck.
LORELAI: Aha! You admit it was a mistake. You did say "cheese."
RORY: I know French, a bit of Spanish, but my Italian -- not so good.
LORELAI: Being trilingual is plenty for a young lady.
RORY: Yeah. [ Sighs sadly ] Mom?
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: [ Sighs with a motherly smile ] It's okay.
RORY: I screwed up. I screwed up so bad. I handled everything wrong.
LORELAI: Oh, honey.
RORY: I keep reliving everything over and over. It's such a mess. I just want to fix it. I have to fix it.
LORELAI: You will.
RORY: I know. I just -- I need a favor.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: It's big.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: I wrote a letter... to Dean. Could you get it to him?
LORELAI: [stunned] Oh.
RORY: I don't know how else to do it. I can't just mail it to his apartment. It's a big favor.
LORELAI: Honey, I don't know.
RORY: It's a lot to ask, but I think that this will make everything better. Please. [desperate] Please. I can't wait until I get home. I have to do something now.
LORELAI: A letter, huh? Well, get it to me, and I will get it to him.
RORY: Thank you. Thank you.
LORELAI: Have some espresso and limburger for me.
RORY: I will. [sincerely] I love you, mom.
LORELAI: I love you, too. Bye.
RORY: Bye.
[They hang up.]
LORELAI: [to gardener] You know, I think if you made it a little fuller -
SOOKIE: [spies Lorelai through the window] Go!
LORELAI: Going. [exits the porch]



[CUT TO RENAISSANCE FAIRE ]
[Pan down from a wooden sign carved with the words: "Lady Elizabeth's Accessories" spelled out in fancy lettering. Liz hands a small purchase to a Faire visitor.]
LIZ: [speaking with acceptable faire language] I want to thank thee, kind lady, for your purchase. Please take one of my cards. Note the website. And do enjoy your day at the Faire. [customer leaves as Luke walks up smiling at his sister] I am kickin' ass! [Luke chuckles] Who knew I was a master salesman?
LUKE: So, I'm all packed and ready to go.
LIZ: Good, and don't worry about nothing, 'cause we're all cool here.
T.J.: [overhears them and continues his conversation with a fellow renaissance vendor] Well, that's the thing. In 10 years, I could die, and they could very well trace it back to this moment. "He got back up on his feet too fast." That's what they can say. [glances back at Liz and Luke's expression] It's weird when people who aren't doctors start thinking they're doctors.
LIZ: He'll be fine.
LUKE: [insincerely] Gosh, I was so worried. [Liz chuckles] So, I'm gonna make a phone call, and then I'll go.
LIZ: Okay. [Luke exits] Hey, hon, could you try and get this cash box open? It's stuck again. [hands T.J. the metal box and a screwdriver]
T.J.: If you want. It's just I was holding this screwdriver before, and I almost blacked out. I'll try again.
LIZ: Thanks.
[T.J. struggles and grunts to open the box, then watches as Luke approaches while dialing his cell phone.]
T.J.: Luuuke! Don't forget the undercover guys. They look for cell phones.
LUKE: I'll keep an eye out.
T.J.: Luuuuuuuke, I'm being your friend here.
LUKE: [ Sighs ]
[CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE]
[Lorelai enters carrying the mail and hears her telephone ringing]
LORELAI: Hello?
LUKE: Hey, it's me.
[Scene switches between Faire and Lorelai's house]
LORELAI: Well, huzzah and prithee. Art thou -- ?
LUKE: Stop.
LORELAI: Sorry. How are you?
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: Sorry, that was incomplete. How are you, you big, fat liar?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: You said you would be home yesterday.
LUKE: I'm coming home today for sure.
LORELAI: "Oh, what's that, Lucy? A football for me to kick?"
LUKE: I mean it this time.
[T.J. feigns distress from his attempts to open the metal cash box]
T.J.: Oh, whoa! Man! Whoo!
LUKE: [rolls his eyes] It's a done deal.
LORELAI: I'll believe it when I see it.
LUKE: Did I tell you about Bill?
LORELAI: "Hay Bale Bill"? No. Spill. [shuffles through the mail]
LUKE: He crawled in a tent with "Grog Booth Annie".
LORELAI: No way!
LUKE: He did.
LORELAI: [appalled] But she's engaged to the fruit-ice guy!
LUKE: It's not gonna last.
LORELAI: [recognizes a familiar envelope] Oh, boy.
LUKE: You feeling okay?
T.J.: [thinking Luke is talking to him] I'm very nauseous.
LUKE: Not you, T.J.
LORELAI: I'm fine. I just have a little assignment I've got to do. So, what lie are you gonna tell me about coming home now?
LUKE: I'm coming home today.
LORELAI: So, next week?
LUKE: Today.
T.J.: [to a passing customer] Milady, dost thou have Pepto-Bismol on thee? Or breadstuffs?
LORELAI: This month at least?
LUKE: Today.
LORELAI: See you when Hillary's president.
LUKE: I'll see you later today.
LORELAI: Bye.
[Smiling, Luke clicks off the call with a beep and casually looks at the necklaces displayed]
LIZ: [limps closer] Looking for something specific?
LUKE: Nah. Well... you remember those earrings you got me before?
LIZ: Yeah.
LUKE: You have a necklace that would match that?
LIZ: Yeah, I think so. You give them to a girl?
LUKE: Yeah.
LIZ: Anyone I know?
LUKE: Oh, you know, it's just someone.
LIZ: Dark hair, bright, blue eyes? You were just talking to her? I could tell, 'cause you grin a lot when you do.
LUKE: [blushes and looks down grinning] It's Lorelai.
LIZ: It's Lorelai! Huzzah!
T.J.: Huzzah!
NEARBY FAIRE PEOPLE: Huzzah!
LUKE: I never got the whole "huzzah" thing.
LIZ: I am so happy for you. You've found your T.J.
LUKE: Please don't put it like that.
LIZ: I've had dreams about you two being together, and my dreams always come true.
T.J.: Dream me a healthy spine, sweets.
LIZ: [to Luke] You're not gonna be alone.
LUKE: [grinning but a bit embarrassed] Yeah, yeah. The necklace.
LIZ: [pulls off one from the tree] Perfect?
LUKE: Perfect.
LIZ: [ Sighs and places gift into a silk pouch] So, go give it to her.
[Luke slips the pouch into his shirt pocket and wraps Liz in a big brotherly hug]
LUKE: take care, Sis.
LIZ: I love you, big brother. [Luke turns to T.J.]
T.J.: Whoa! One hug and my back would snap in eight pieces.
LUKE: [offers hand and shakes with T.J.] Good morrow, buddy.
["Huzzah!" sounds in the distance as Luke exits]
[CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET]
[Lorelai enters and spots a nearby employee]
LORELAI: Excuse me. I'm looking for Dean. [girl points] Thanks.
[Lorelai walks down main aisle and hears Dean's voice]
DEAN: We get lots of stuff from Marco Farms, but a lot of the time, it's hard to predict when it's gonna come in and how much of it we're gonna get. We're kind of at the mercy of [notices Lorelai nearby] -- of the um, guys -- of the farmers themselves, because they sell out a lot. But why don't you leave your name and number when you check out, and we'll give you a call as soon as the eggs you want come in, okay?
[the woman nods and exits as Lorelai approaches]
LORELAI: Dean.
DEAN: Hi.
LORELAI: Hi. [hands an envelope out to him]
DEAN: [suspicious] What's that?
LORELAI: It's a letter for you from Rory.
DEAN: [worried] What happened? Where is she?
LORELAI: Just take the letter.
DEAN: She went to Europe, right? Miss Patty said she went to Europe. What happened? What's she doing there? Who is she with?
LORELAI: Dean.
DEAN: When's she getting back?
LORELAI: Soon. Just take it.
DEAN: Where is she?
LORELAI: Europe.
DEAN: With who?
LORELAI: [gently] Her grandmother. Look, take it.
DEAN: No. Why did she go? Whose idea was it?
LORELAI: That doesn't matter.
DEAN: It does.
LORELAI: Dean, please. I'm a messenger, nothing more. Just take it.
[He hesitates, but takes the letter. Lorelai smiles with sympathy then leaves]
[CUT TO LUKE'S DINER]
[At the counter, Lane and Caesar are discussing the bowl of greens them]
CAESAR: Onion, guacamole, a little red pepper over butter lettuce and endive -- it could be a big seller.
LANE: But, Caesar, it's not the salad. The salad looks delicious. It's what you're calling it.
CAESAR: Caesar's salad.
LANE: Right.
CAESAR: So?
LANE: There's already a Caesar salad. It's kind of famous.
CAESAR: That's Caesar salad. Mine's got an apostrophe "S."
LANE: I don't think that makes it less confusing.
CAESAR: [points to the door] Customers. [exits]
[Zach enters talking with the groupie chicks: Trina and Cheryl]
ZACH: …greatest book I've ever read.
CHERYL: Keep going, Zach.
TRINA: Yeah, this is da b*mb.
ZACH: So, Mary Magdalene goes to Gaul to have the kid.
CHERYL: That's the slutty one, right? Not the mom?
TRINA: It's so confusing 'cause they're all named Mary.
ZACH: She's not the mom, but she's not slutty. That's what this dude Constantine wanted you to believe, right? [Lane is listening to them from counter] He was purging the "E! True Hollywood Story" part of it for his own benefit. Turned the whole thing into Hollywood Babylon, and chicks got the short end. [snaps his fingers and beckons Lane to serve them]
CHERYL: God, I just want to spend, like, three straight years doing nothing but reading, you know?
LANE: [approaches the table] What book?
CHERYL: What?
LANE: [irritated] You're supposed to wait to be seated.
ZACH: Since when?
LANE: Since always. That's what what they do at Denny's.
ZACH: Okay, well, my usual table where I always sit. Okay, Lane?
LANE: Fine Zach. What will you have?
ZACH: Allow me to order for you girls. A ham sandwich for the lady on my right. Light mustard, right Trine? [strokes her forearm while Lane rolls her eyes]
TRINA: [ Giggles ]
LANE: Is that a "yes", Trine?
ZACH: That's a "yes." Burger, no cheese for Cheryl. Cheeseburger for me, and go ahead and sh**t everybody here some fries [winks].
LANE: Free fries are for friends and family only. Sorry.
ZACH: Another new rule?
LANE: Nope -- old. Old as Moses.
ZACH: Okay, just bring me my order, and we'll all share.
LANE: Sorry, no.
ZACH: What?
LANE: You get free fries, you have to eat them.
ZACH: I can't share my own fries?
LANE: That's right.
ZACH: That's bogus.
LANE: That's tough, they're for you, not these girls. They're to be consumed by you, and you alone.
ZACH: I don't believe this.
LANE: I'll be watching to see if you share, so don't get any big ideas.
ZACH: Just forget about it, okay? We'll go to "Al's Pancake World".
LANE: Fine! Go!
ZACH: We are.
LANE: Good.
ZACH: Come on, girls.
LANE: [ Scoffs ] Whatever. Like I care where you go to eat.
[ Door closes ]
[Lane huffs up to the counter and loads condiment trays. Moments later, the door rings. Cheryl enters and approaches Lane]
CHERYL: Hey.
LANE: [impatient] What?
CHERYL: Sorry. We didn't know.
LANE: Know what? [Cheryl smiles knowingly and glances out the windows before she leaves] Know what?
[Lane watches her leave with a clueless look that gradually changes to understanding]
[CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK]
[Sookie and Lorelai stroll down the sidewalk.]
SOOKIE: So... so, this is nice. Being away from the inn for a whole day.
LORELAI: Get some perspective.
SOOKIE: Just looking at something other than those same walls.
LORELAI: Oh.
SOOKIE: What a relief.
LORELAI: It all falls away. [they both walk and ponder]
SOOKIE: My meat guy better not screw me like he did yesterday.
LORELAI: Oh, my God! The gutters! That's what I forgot.
SOOKIE: I told Steve that if he doesn't leave by 3:00 --
LORELAI: Hey, hey, did I tell Michel to have the guy check all the radiators or just the one - [both chatter at once] no, no, I did. I did.
[ Both giggle ]
SOOKIE: Ah, now it's falling away.
LORELAI: It's starting to.
[They both overhear loud voices from a second story apartment window above]
LINDSAY: I hate you, Dean! I hate everything! [a bundle of clothing is thrown from the window, fluttering down to the sidewalk below.]
DEAN: Let's just talk.
LINDSAY: I don't want to talk! I don't want you here! [out of the window comes a hockey stick]
DEAN: I'm sorry, okay?
LINDSAY: Sorry?
DEAN: Yes, because it'll never happen again.
SOOKIE: Oh, my God.
LORELAI: Oh, my God.
LINDSAY: Get out now. Now.
DEAN: Don't! You've got my --
LINDSAY: Don't you dare! [another bundle of clothes exits the window]
DEAN: Can you not -
SOOKIE: Well, that's what happens when you get married too young. [flinches]
LORELAI: [uncomfortable look] Yeah, that must be it.
DEAN: [OS] I'm sorry. There's not much I can do but say I'm sorry.
LINDSAY: You know, there was a lot you could have done. [more clothing out the window] And you know what? You didn't do it!
SOOKIE: [fascinated] This is juicy. I usually only get to hear about these things. I never get to see them.
DEAN: [OS] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I mean, can we do something? Can we get over this?
LINDSAY: [OS] Too late! Look out the window!
LORELAI: [uncomfortable] Yeah, lucky us. Come on.
DEAN: Let's just talk.
LINDSAY: I hate you Dean.
[Lorelai and Sookie continue walking down the sidewalk]
[CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN]
[Sookie talks on the phone as Lorelai puts away items]
SOOKIE: You definitely prepped the sauce for the duck? Because the duck without the sauce, is a duck that we can't use. The sauce has to be prepped early. I know you said it. Say it again. Stop saying "let it go"! Stop saying "let it go," John. Stop it. Stop it! I am letting it go. I just need you to assure me that everything's getting done so that I know I can fully let it go.
[door slams]
RORY: [OS] Hello?
LORELAI: [ Gasps ] Kitchen!
SOOKIE: I am hanging up, but I am not letting it go!
[Rory appears in the kitchen doorway]
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Oh, my traveler. [they hug tightly]
RORY: I missed you.
LORELAI: I missed you, too.
RORY: Sookie!
SOOKIE: [ Squeals and hugs Rory ] You remember who I am!
[door shuts]
EMILY: [OS] Hello!
LORELAI: Hi. [calls out to signal their location]
[Emily enters the kitchen]
EMILY: Hello, Lorelai. Hello, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Hi, Emily.
LORELAI: Hi, Mom. [leans to hug her mother]
EMILY: Don't! I smell like airplane.
RORY: I should go get my bags.
EMILY: [scolding] Rory, you do not touch bags.
RORY: Oh, I thought that was just a Europe thing.
EMILY: The driver's bringing them in. [to Lorelai] We had such a trip. Rory will fill you in. Spare her the more salacious aspects.
LORELAI: [intrigued] Salacious aspects?
EMILY: Those European men -- young, old, in between -- they saw us coming.
SOOKIE: [puzzled] They saw you coming where?
EMILY: We were like magnets. Such high libidos.
LORELAI: You weren't wearing your "hot and wealthy" sandwich board, were you, Mom?
RORY: She was very popular.
EMILY: Well, I should go. I bring you back a charming, cultured, well-mannered young lady. Don't undo it.
LORELAI: I will definitely try not to not undo it.
EMILY: Well, goodbye, all. Goodbye, Rory.
RORY: Bye, Grandma. [leans forward to hug Emily]
EMILY: Nope. Airplane.
RORY: Oh, I can take it. Thanks, Grandma.
EMILY: Ciao. [leaves]
LORELAI: Come here, you. [urges Rory to join her at the kitchen table]
RORY: [giggle] So, what are you guys doing home?
LORELAI: We're trying to get some distance from the inn.
SOOKIE: And it's going through the roof. Not the inn's roof -- that's solid as a rock. You know what I mean. We're booked to 90% capacity. And the restaurant -- we're turning people away. Oh, you know all that.
RORY: No, keep going.
SOOKIE: Well, customers agree that, despite Michel, we're their favorite Connecticut inn. That's nothing compared to the big town news.
[Lorelai gapes and tries to signal Sookie to silence]
RORY: [fascinated] Wow. What?
LORELAI: Sookie - [shakes her head to silence Sookie]
SOOKIE: We walked past Dean's place, and Lindsay was throwing his stuff out on the street. They were really going at it. It was like "Raging Bull." There's yelling and screaming.
[Rory is stunned]
LORELAI: Sookie, you're exploding all over the poor girl.
SOOKIE: Oh, sorry.
LORELAI: And she's probably hungry. You're hungry, right Honey? [Rory slowly nods]
SOOKIE: Oh, I'll whip us something up.
LORELAI: Oh no, you said you had to pick up Davey, so we'll go out, you know? We'll call you later.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay, let's go. [pushes the issue by standing and urging them all to the front door. She wraps her arm around Rory's shoulders.]
[CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT PORCH]
[Sookie, Rory and Lorelai all exit the door]
SOOKIE: Talk to you later. [walks down steps and leaves]
LORELAI: See you later, Sookie. [She and Rory walk in the opposite direction down the sidewalk.]
RORY: What happened?
[CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE GAZEBO]
[Rory and Lorelai are walking slowly around it.]
LORELAI: It was unbelievable. It was bad. She was yelling. She was throwing things. He was yelling. She called him a jerk. It was very violent and very public. Other people saw it. It was horrible.
RORY: [miserable] This was not supposed to happen.
[They bump into Lindsay and her mother]
MRS. LISTER: You! You should be ashamed of yourself -- what you did!
LORELAI: Just wait.
MRS. LISTER: What did she ever do to you, huh? How did she hurt you? Why are you doing this?
LORELAI: Theresa, please. Calm down.
MRS. LISTER: Calm down? My little girl has to come home and find your heinous letter in Dean's jacket.
LORELAI: Listen, we're in the street --
MRS. LISTER: You little monster!
LORELAI: Hey! Pull back, lady!
MRS. LISTER: There aren't hundreds of other boys in the world? You have to go after her husband?
LORELAI: Okay, stop attacking my daughter right now. You're upset, I get it, but you do not do this.
MRS. LISTER: She slept with my son-in-law. She broke up a marriage. Are you proud?
LORELAI: She did not break up a marriage.
MRS. LISTER: What do you know of this?
LORELAI: Enough. I know Rory.
MRS. LISTER: All I know is that now my Lindsay is devastated, Dean is back with his parents, lives are destroyed, and you and your daughter can go to hell! [She storms off dragging her daughter with her]
[Rory wipes her eyes and pushes her hair from her face in silence.]
LORELAI: [ Clears throat ] Okay, I have got to know what was in that letter.
RORY: Um... I... I told him...that... that night was special and...that I wasn't sorry that it happened. But he's married, and... he has to figure out his life. So I was going to make it easier for him and take myself out of the mix.
LORELAI: [sympathetic] Well, that was a very good letter.
RORY: I can't believe she found it.
LORELAI: [looking around] We can't keep standing here.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: These streets are dangerous right now.
RORY: Very.
LORELAI: Come on. [They walk off]
[CUT TO SIDWALK IN FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER]
[Lorelai and Rory approach and walk in]
LORELAI: Anything you want is on me. Pie, cake, pancakes, pan pie, cake pan, panacockin. Say the word or make one up. It's yours. [they sit]
RORY: Chair feels good.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. A chair does feel good.
RORY: [slowly considering] I think a root beer might be good.
LORELAI: Root beer sounds good!
[Luke appears at their table]
LUKE: It's on the house, so go crazy.
LORELAI: [surprised] Luke!
LUKE: [grins at Lorelai] Hey. [to Rory] Hi, Rory. Welcome back.
RORY: Thanks.
LUKE: [looks at Rory concerned] Are you okay? You look a little pale.
LORELAI: You know, pale's the new tan.
[Luke smiles warmly at her]
LORELAI: [ Chuckles and smiles back ] So, you're here. [smacks him on the chest] You're not a mirage.
LUKE: I told you I was coming back.
LORELAI: But you lied to me repeatedly for weeks, so your credibility's been shattered.
LUKE: I know. It's been seven weeks.
LORELAI: [grins and smacks him again] Seven weeks.
LUKE: [ Chuckles nervously and looks at the ground before clearing his throat ] You know, I just remembered -- I have an errand to run.
LORELAI: [skeptical] Oh, yeah?
LUKE: I got to go to the pharmacy. I'm gonna go now. [to Rory] Lane's here. She'll bring you your root beer. [calls out to the kitchen] Hey, Lane, I got to run down to the pharmacy! Got an errand.
LANE: [OS] Okay!
LUKE: [to the Gilmore girls] So… I'll be back in a bit.
[As he exits, he glances back at Lorelai before hurrying off. Lane rushes up to their table.]
LANE: Rory?!
RORY: Hey, you!
LANE: You're back! [to Lorelai] Our girl's back.
LORELAI: I know.
LANE: We need to consult.
RORY: Oh, sounds serious.
LANE: I'm in a quandary.
RORY: Other people's quandaries. I'm all ears.
[Lorelai gazes out the window to where Luke disappeared]
LORELAI: Hey, you know, I just remembered -- I have to go to Doose's to... pick something up. You need a banana or anything?
RORY: I'm good.
LORELAI: Are you sure?
RORY: Yeah, I'm consulting on a quandary. Go.
LORELAI: Okay. I'll be right back. [she leaves]
LANE: So, my quandary -- are you ready? And I need honesty.
RORY: sh**t.
LANE: Am I in love with Zach?
RORY: What?
LANE: I need to know if you think I'm in love with Zach, 'cause a dirty trollop suggested it, and they're generally reliable about these things.
RORY: A dirty trollop?
LANE: She said something to me and gave me this sort of knowing, worldly look that seemed to suggest I was acting in a way that said I have a thing for Zach, or she was hitting on me. I just need to know your thought on this. [Rory stares at her mutely] Hey. Are you listening?
[CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK - NEAR THE WESTON BAKERY]
[Luke stands nervously beside a tall, shady bush, shifting his weight from foot to foot clutching a small paper sack. Lorelai briskly walks around the corner and spies him.]
LORELAI: Hey. There you are. [walks up to him]
LUKE: Hi.
LORELAI: So -- [notices the sack] oh, you really ran an errand.
LUKE: I didn't run an errand, but I sort of kept up the pretense. So I went in the pharmacy. So, I was in the pharmacy, so I had to buy something, so I… I feel kind of dumb.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: [chuckles nervously ]
LORELAI: But you didn't really have an errand, right?
LUKE: Naw, It was just getting kind of crowded back there, you know?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: So, I brought you something. [Luke hands her the paper sack while he digs around in his shirt pocket]
LORELAI: Oh. [ pulls out a pack of cigarettes and gasps with pretense of delight] My own smokes. Ginchy. [looks up and sees Luke holding a beautiful dangling necklace.] Oh. [takes the fine chain] That's beautiful.
LUKE: [shyly] I think that'll match the earrings I got you before. If they don't, I'll take them back.
LORELAI: [pulls aside her hair and displays necklace beside her earrings] Definitely goes.
LUKE: Oh, yeah, look at that. Perfect match.
LORELAI: Perfect match.
[They lean closer ready to kiss. Suddenly, cymbals crash, marching band plays and appears around the corner followed by a whole parade. ]
LUKE: [irritated] I don't believe it. What the hell is this?
LORELAI: Cider mill.
LUKE: Oh for the love of…
[People walk past carrying balloons, clown juggles a large apple. Michel appears being dragged by the Krumholtz children]
LITTLE BOY: Hurry up, Michel!
MICHEL: What are you doing here?
LORELAI: What are you doing here?
MICHEL: I'm enjoying the cider mill parade. Such culture I've been missing all these years. This band -- so subtle. Like a polo mallet hitting your head.
LITTLE BOY: Come on!
LITTLE GIRL: Yeah, Come on!
MICHEL: Don't pull! I'm fragile!
[people continue to walk past, several dancing apples waltz by]
LUKE: This town...
LORELAI: "-- is our town. This town is so glamorous".
LUKE: [hesitant] So, we'll hook up later, maybe.
LORELAI: We'll hook up later. Definitely.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: I love the necklace.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: Good. [distractedly bumps into a spectator, causing him to release a fistful of red balloons] Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no! Oh, let me pay you. I don't have any cash. Um, well, would you take an I.O.U.? Have you been to the Dragonfly Inn? The food is great. Would you like to -- oh, I know. [pulls out the cigarettes] Do you smoke?
[CUT TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE FORESTER HOUSE - FRONT DOOR]
[Rory knocks on the door and stands waiting. Dean opens the door.]
RORY: Hi. [Dean exits and quietly closes behind him] I hope this is okay. I wasn't sure where to call, and I just had to -- are you okay?
DEAN: [ Scoffs ] Am I okay?
RORY: Yeah, I mean... how do you...feel? [Dean scoffs again looking around] I'm sorry. That's a stupid question.
DEAN: No. It's not a stupid question. Um...let's see. How do I feel? Actually...I feel like an idiot.
RORY: Why?
DEAN: Why? Because I was married, …Rory. Married. And I threw it all away for someone who dumped me once and then just bailed on me.
RORY: I didn't just bail. I --
DEAN: I hurt everybody. I hurt Lindsay, I hurt her parents, I hurt my parents, and now I'm back at home, and you're in Europe with your grandmother. And what the hell was I thinking? I mean, what am I doing? What's wrong with me?
RORY: [looks miserable] Nothing.
DEAN: I got to get ready for work. [long pause then turns and goes inside.]
[Rory sighs, then turns around and gazes up in misery. A group of escaped red balloons float by and higher into the sky.]
[CUT TO LORELAI'S HOME - EXTERIOR NIGHT]
RORY: [OS from inside] So, finish your story.
LORELAI: [OS from inside] Everybody knows you don't mess with Hay Bale Bill.
[CUT TO LORELAI'S HOME - LIVING ROOM]
LORELAI: [OS from kitchen] So Hay Bale goes off and punches the guy, and it turned out to be the wrong guy -- all over this perceived insult about his girlfriend's legs.
RORY: Wait -- which one had hairy legs -- Annie the Grog Girl or Ocarina Jane, who secretly sold pot behind the brass-rubbing booth?
LORELAI: You mean "hairiest."
RORY: Egads.
LORELAI: I'm thinking bathing-suit season at the Renaissance Faire is only enjoyed by the blind.
RORY: Hmm.
LORELAI: Hey, I should bring steak sauce, right?
RORY: For what?
LORELAI: Pizza.
RORY: I just got back from Italy.
LORELAI: So?
RORY: So they'd sh**t you in Italy for that.
LORELAI: But this is America, where we unapologetically bastardize other countries' cultures in a gross quest for moral and military supremacy.
RORY: I forgot. Bring on the imperialistic condiments.
LORELAI: Hey, do you think Annie the Grog Girl made a pass at Luke? I'm sure he rebuffed her, but he was there a long time. I hope not. I'd joust the little slut.
RORY: [ Chuckles ] Hmm.
LORELAI: So, you want to talk about --
RORY: Something to watch?
LORELAI: Uh, yes. Something to watch.
RORY: You pick.
LORELAI: Will you be mad if it's "Showgirls" again? I got the deluxe edition with sh*t glasses and a drinking game. [Rory looks up sadly. They sit in silence for a few moments] Sanctuary.
RORY: [takes a big breath] Let me show you one thing before "Showgirls," okay?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Home movies from my trip with Grandma.
LORELAI: You have home movies?
RORY: [clicks on TV and tape] She was in fine form.
[playing on the TV is an old movie. An elder woman and a young girl gaze out a patio window]
OLDER WOMAN IN MOVIE: Signora distinctly wrote, "south rooms with a view and close together." Instead of which, she has given us north rooms without a view and a long way apart.
LORELAI: She gets very British when she's abroad.
RORY: Oh, yes.
OLDER WOMAN IN MOVIE: Hurry and get dressed, dear, or we'll miss our dinner, on top of everything else.
LORELAI: And you look very innocent and pretty.
RORY: It was a great view. I don't know what she was talking about.
OLDER WOMAN IN MOVIE: ...What we were led to expect. I thought we were going to see... the signora distinctly wrote, "south rooms with a view"...

OPEN OUTSIDE ELDER GILMORE POOLHOUSE - EVENING
[View of glass French windows and doors reveals an elegant interior. The nearby swimming pool casts a shimmering light on the building's exterior.]
LORELAI: [OS] Shaken, not stirred, please, Jeeves.
CUT TO POOLHOUSE INTERIOR
[Lorelai and Rory sit on a plush loveseat, Richard on a padded club chair while a male servant mixes drinks at a nearby bar table.]
RICHARD: His name is Robert.
LORELAI: I thought every butler's name was Jeeves.
RICHARD: He's not a butler. He's a valet.
LORELAI: So he parks your car?
RICHARD: No, he does not park my car. He does exactly what you see him doing.
LORELAI: So he is a bartender.
RICHARD: He attends to my needs.
LORELAI: So he's a geisha.
RICHARD: You'll be quieter once you have a drink, I assume. [to Rory] So, young lady, you're starting your second year of Yale this week.
RORY: Yeah, I move into Branford on Monday.
RICHARD: You're going to love Branford College. That where I lived, you know.
RORY: I know.
RICHARD: It is the oldest of Yale's residential colleges. They have these Carillon bells that are enchanting, and it has, what was called by Robert Frost, the most beautiful college courtyard in America.
[Robert serves drinks]
RORY: Well, I'll tell you what, Grandpa -- I'll get settled in, and then we can have lunch there.
RICHARD: Ah, that's a deal.
ROBERT: You wanted me to remind you that you were going to bring out the Hungarian cheese, sir.
RICHARD: Yes I did. I'll be right back. [he stands and exits]
RORY: This is crazy.
LORELAI: Well, it depends on your definition of "crazy." I, for one, found the Mariah Carey phone messages to her fans just refreshingly imaginative.
RORY: We're having drinks in the pool house.
LORELAI: Yup.
RORY: The last time I was in the pool house was the last time I was in the pool.
LORELAI: I know. I pushed you in.
RORY: So, Grandpa's actually living out here?
[they watch him as he prepares a small tray]
LORELAI: Looks like.
RORY: Do you think he's happy?
LORELAI: I do. I think he's very happy out here with his books and his special friend, Robert.
RORY: Don't be gross.
LORELAI: What? I'm just saying two grown men out here alone with Hungarian cheese and swim trunks...
RORY: Oh, jeez.
LORELAI: Don't be so puritanical. After all, Heather has two mommies.
RICHARD: All right, we have cheese, we have drinks. Do you each have a coaster?
LORELAI: [holds up philosopher pictured coaster] Kierkegaard.
RORY: [holds up] Schopenhauer.
RICHARD: Excellent.
[ Knock on door. Robert opens the door to reveal a female servant. ]
ROBERT: Yes?
MADONNA LOUISE: Dinner is served in the main house.
ROBERT: I will tell Mr. Gilmore. [stiffly walks ten feet to where they are sitting] Dinner is served in the main house.
LORELAI: But we haven't finished our drinks yet.
MADONNA LOUISE: But the madam is ready now.
RICHARD: Well, ladies, it's been a lovely evening. Until next week...
LORELAI: Hold on, Dad. [gulps her martini]
RORY: Thank you, Grandpa.
LORELAI: Yeah. Thanks for the cheese, Dad. Bye.
[Rory kisses her grandfather's cheek and follows Lorelai]
CUT TO INTERIOR OF MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM
[Emily, Lorelai and Rory seated alone at the large table. Madonna Louise places a bowl before Lorelai and returns to kitchen.]
LORELAI: Hmm. Soup in 100-degree weather. Cool.
EMILY: I have the air-conditioning on, Lorelai.
RORY: I like it, Grandma.
LORELAI: Oh, my God, the sucking up.
EMILY: Stop it. [then to Rory] Thank you. It's fennel potato puree with a touch of chili to give it spice. I thought we could go more exotic now that it's just us girls.
LORELAI: If you really want an exotic girls' night out, Mom, let's hit Baja.
EMILY: So, Rory, tell me, what's new?
LORELAI: Different room, same reaction.
RORY: Oh, nothing much.
EMILY: Really? Well, what was new 20 minutes ago?
RORY: Excuse me?
EMILY: What did you talk about with your grandfather?
RORY: Oh, well --
EMILY: I mean, just because he gets you first in the evening doesn't mean you get to waste all the good stories on him.
RORY: I didn't wa --
EMILY: So, you just tell me everything you told him exactly as you told him, leave nothing out.
RORY: Okay. Well, I'm moving into Branford College on Monday.
EMILY: You know, Robert Frost said that Branford has the most beautiful college courtyard in America.
LORELAI: Hmm. You don't say.
EMILY: You knew that?
RORY: No.
EMILY: He told you that?
LORELAI: No.
EMILY: You've already discussed everything there is to discuss. You're all talked out.
LORELAI: We're not all talked out.
EMILY: He gets you first, talks you out, and I get two exhausted, empty shells. [notices Richard tip-toeing through the room] What do you think you're doing?
RICHARD: I needed to get something out of my study.
EMILY: [stands and walks over to him] You are supposed to stay in the pool house. That is what we agreed on.
RICHARD: I am in the pool house.
EMILY: Oh, really? Right now?
RICHARD: No, not right now. I told you I had to get something.
EMILY: Well, you should have called, made an appointment.
RICHARD: To go into my own study?
EMILY: You don't live here anymore, Richard. What if I was sitting in the living room stark-naked? [Both sad, Rory and Lorelai exchange looks.]
RICHARD: You've never been in the living room stark-naked. You've never been stark-naked. We went skinny-dipping one night, and you wore an overcoat.
EMILY: The water was freezing! [she follows Richard as he exits]
RORY: Crazy.
LORELAI: You said it, Patsy Cline.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory enter the diner deep in conversation]
LORELAI: Okay, but think about it. Why do we need the word "potty"? Is it really that much harder for a kid to learn the word "bathroom"?
RORY: I don't know. [they sit at a table]
LORELAI: "Timmy, do you have to go potty?" Or "Timmy, do you have to go to the bathroom?" See? Interchangeable.
RORY: Not exactly interchangeable.
LORELAI: How are they not interchangeable?
RORY: To go potty is an action. To go to the bathroom is to go into a specific place.
LORELAI: I hate the word "potty."
RORY: Well, what did you teach me to say?
LORELAI: "Bathroom."
RORY: You did?
LORELAI: Yes, of course.
RORY: I'm 2, I come up to you and I say, "Mommy, Mommy, I have to go to the -" --
LORELAI: The room where legends die.
[Luke walks up with ordering pad in hand]
LUKE: What can I get you?
RORY: A foster home.
LORELAI: You'll thank me one day. [sexy smile to Luke] Hi.
LUKE: I'm working.
LORELAI: Come on. This is the beginning of a relationship. You're supposed to act stupid.
LUKE: I'll do the chicken dance on my lunch break. [to Rory] Heading back to school?
RORY: Yeah, sophomore year.
LUKE: Anything you want - on the house.
LORELAI: [too bright smile] I can't believe you won't flirt with me in front of my daughter. She's gonna think there's something wrong with me.
RORY: Please. I got that confirmation letter a long time ago. Scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and half bacon, half sausage.
LORELAI: I'll have the same, and put it on her tab.
LUKE: You get your own tab.
LORELAI: [dryly] Oh, thank God you don't have a Latin accent, or you'd be completely irresistible.
LUKE: Coffee will be ready in a minute. [backs away while subtlety signaling Lorelai with his head.]
LORELAI: Be back in a second. [She walks over to the counter. Luke stands behind the counter writing in his ledger book.]
LORELAI: [ Clears throat ] You gestured?
LUKE: [continues to look down while speaking quietly] Those jeans are really working for you.
LORELAI: Yeah?
LUKE: They're working for me, too.
LORELAI: You're flirting with me.
LUKE: Something like that.
LORELAI: Finally. Do it some more.
LUKE: Your shoes work well with that - shirt. [briefly glances up]
LORELAI: Gee, Carson, thanks.
LUKE: That's all I can do right now. People are watching.
LORELAI: Okay.
LUKE: [meaningfully raises his eyes] But tonight I will give you my extremely positive views on other aspects of your being.
LORELAI: Tonight?
LUKE: Are you free?
LORELAI: Yeah, I'm free.
LUKE: Good. 7:30.
LORELAI: What are we gonna do?
LUKE: I've got some thoughts.
LORELAI: Alright, but no taking me to an art museum after hours and then to an empty Hollywood bowl where you give me a pair of diamond earrings that you bought with your college money when all the time you're really in love with your best friend, the drummer, who's posing as our driver for the evening.
LUKE: [pause] Okay, I'll think of something else.
LORELAI: So, what do we say?
LUKE: Say?
LORELAI: To people, to the town. Do we tell them we're dating?
LUKE: I don't know. Do we?
LORELAI: I don't know. I guess we could keep it quiet for a while.
LUKE: We could -- if that's what you want.
LORELAI: No, that's not what I want.
LUKE: Why don't we just play it by ear?
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. People will know when they know.
LUKE: Okay, sounds good.
LORELAI: Okay, so, 7:30?
LUKE: 7:30
LORELAI: Are you gonna watch me walk away?
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: I'll add a little jaunt to it for you.
[she struts back to Rory and glances back before she sits]
RORY: What was that all about?
LORELAI: We were just talking about our date for tonight.
RORY: A real date? Finally!
LORELAI: Yeah, finally.
RORY: What are you gonna wear?
LORELAI: Mmm, glass slippers, a backwards baseball cap...
RORY: …and nothing else.
LORELAI: Exactly.
RORY: I'm very excited.
LORELAI: Me too. Hey, have you talked to --
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Do you think you're going to before you - [Rory shakes her head no to end the topic as Luke walks up.] Oh, food. Thank God.
LUKE: Hot plates.
LORELAI: See? He called me "Hot Plates." He so likes me.
LUKE: Jeez. [embarrassed, he looks around before exiting]
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
[Emily is seated at a small desk looking through paperwork. Maid works busily nearby. High pitches barking is heard in the distance ]
EMILY: The mail must be here. [Door bell rings] The Farthingtons' dogs are apoplectic. Ridiculous choice of animal -- a vicious 3-inch ball of hair and a bow -- a ridiculous pink bow for the vicious k*ll. "Oh, watch out! Cecil b*at and the Duke of Windsor are headed straight for my shoes!" [maid enters with a handful of mail] Thank you. I'd like some coffee when you get a chance. [the maid nods and exits. Emily shuffles through the mail - opening one envelope]
CUT TO KITCHEN
[Maid is preparing coffee when Emily enters]
EMILY: Did we ever hear back from Mr. Gilmore about the Heart Association luncheon?
MADONNA LOUISE: I told his valet about it.
EMILY: And what a help that was. Well, call his valet back and tell him I need a meeting with Mr. Gilmore this afternoon.
MADONNA LOUISE: Yes, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Thank you. [ Barking continues ] Oh, shut up!
CUT TO YALE COURTYARD
[Rory directs two moving men carrying a sofa into her dorm lobby]
RORY: Careful. If you stain that, my grandmother will hunt you down and k*ll you. I wish that I was kidding. I'll get the door.
MARTY: Rory!
RORY: Marty, hi! It's nice to see you! [they hug] So, are you living here?
MARTY: I'm living here.
RORY: That's great. So am I. [notices the impatient movers] Oh, sorry. I have to let these guys in. So, how was your summer?
MARTY: I met Nicole Richie, and then spent the next six weeks showering.
RORY: [holds an interior hall door open for the movers] It should be open.
MOVING MAN: [balances sofa and checks knob] Door's locked.
RORY: Oh, really? Sorry. I thought that Paris would be here already. [opens door and Marty follows her in before the movers.]
MARTY: Nice room.
[Movers set sofa down and exit]
RORY: I can't believe I b*at Paris here. I mean, normally, she would want to get dibs on the best room first and set up the furniture exactly the way she wants it.
MARTY: Maybe she's just late.
RORY: Paris is never late. [dials number on her cell phone] Paris, hey, it's Rory.
PARIS: Rory. Hello.
RORY: I'm in our room, and I was just wondering how I could have b*at you here.
PARIS: I'll be there later.
RORY: Are you okay? You sound funny.
PARIS: Asher's dead.
RORY: What?
PARIS: He died two weeks ago in Oxford.
RORY: Oh. Paris, I'm sorry. How?
PARIS: Heart attack. It was quick.
RORY: Heart attack?
PARIS: Yes.
RORY: Um...it wasn't during, um...was it?
PARIS: No, Rory. This great man was not brought down by my vagina, okay?
RORY: Okay. Sorry. I just -- that's terrible.
PARIS: He was teaching a Shakespeare class -- "A Midsummer Night's Dream." He was doing Puck, and then suddenly he wasn't.
RORY: Oh, man.
PARIS: And the class was so into his reading, they didn't even get it. They thought he was acting. It was Dick Shawn all over again.
RORY: Where are you?
PARIS: I'm in his flat trying to get his effects squared away, and, of course, his family is acting like spoiled children. All they care about is what they get. If I have to moderate one more argument about the Chippendale desk, I'm going to freak out. And the lawyer handling his affairs is a moron, and don't even get me started on the funeral. He wanted to be cremated, but if you had seen how filthy that crematorium was -- so I shipped him to Cambridge, which apparently is known for its cremation facilities. That was a transportation nightmare, and, of course, his daughter was upset with the move, but where was she at Thanksgiving, huh?
RORY: Is there anything I can do to help?
PARIS: No. Thanks. [long pause] I'm sad.
RORY: I know.
PARIS: Bye.
RORY: Bye. [to Marty] Asher Fleming died.
MARTY: In bed?
RORY: No.
MARTY: Damn. I lost the pool.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lorelai crosses street seeing some friends gathered close sharing gossip by the news stand]
BABETTE: Are you sure?
MISS PATTY: Jerry found her birth certificate stashed in her bathroom.
MRS. CASINI: I am not surprised. She knew way too much about sushi to be from Kentucky.
LORELAI: Hi, ladies. What's the dirt today?
BABETTE: Jerry Cutler's new wife, Annabel.
MISS PATTY: Oh, that name alone.
BABETTE: Turns out the 24-year-old former Miss Magnolia Blossom had a little secret.
LORELAI: What?
MISS PATTY: Her birthday! [bursts out laughing]
BABETTE: Seems that 24 is actually code for 36.
LORELAI: No!
BABETTE: Yep. Jerry the moron wound up with a tramp who's actually a year older than the wife he dumped her for. [they all laugh] You got to love the karma.
LORELAI: How's Jerry taking it?
MRS. CASINI: He's getting his eyeglass prescription checked.
LORELAI: CNN's got nothing on you gals. See ya. [walks off]
BABETTE: See you later, sugar.
MRS. CASINI: So, you heard that Marilyn Horne is actually a man?
BABETTE: I'm not surprised.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOME - INTERIOR
[They sit at opposite ends of the polished dining table - formally discussing various topics - each with a calendar planner before them]
RICHARD: I sent the check off to the landscaper a week ago.
EMILY: He claims he hasn't received it.
RICHARD: Well, he's lying.
EMILY: Shall I tell him that?
RICHARD: I will stop payment on the check and issue another one.
EMILY: Fine. There's the issue of the Gregorys' cocktail party on the fourth. Even though they did miss our Christmas party last year, you are currently involved in a business deal with Hamilton, so one of us should probably attend.
RICHARD: Jancy will definitely want you to be there.
EMILY: Fine. I'll go. [prepares to make a note]
RICHARD: No, that's all right. I should go.
EMILY: Fine, then you'll go
RICHARD: Though I had to go to the Newmans' Zoo Auction last week.
EMILY: Fine. Then I'll go.
RICHARD: No, it's my business. I'll go.
EMILY: Fine.
RICHARD: Unless you would like to go.
EMILY: Moving on to the subject of your car -
RICHARD: Excuse me?
EMILY: You parked the Cadillac in the driveway when you worked on it this weekend, and it leaked oil all over the place.
RICHARD: It's a tiny stain, Emily.
EMILY: It's a large stain, and I see it every day when I walk in and out of the door.
RICHARD: Really? You can see the driveway with your nose way up in the air like that? [Emily stares stonily in silence] I apologize. That was uncalled for.
EMILY: I think you should restrict your cars to their garages at all times.
RICHARD: I will park my cars anywhere I like.
EMILY: You never used to leave your cars in the driveway before.
RICHARD: I park there when I work on them.
EMILY: Well, work on them somewhere else.
RICHARD: Like where?
EMILY: What about the filling station? It's already filthy there.
RICHARD: Are you seriously suggesting that I drive a priceless antique car 12 blocks away, park it next to a broken-down Chevy, and do my restoring there?
EMILY: Yes.
RICHARD: So this is the way it's going to be from now on.
EMILY: I suppose it is.
RICHARD: A filling station will be fine.
EMILY: Thank you.
RICHARD: I suppose we should discuss the insurance papers.
EMILY: I suppose we should.
CUT TO YALE COURTYARD
[Rory and Marty take coffee from vendor]
MARTY: I mean, I always thought I looked a lot like my Uncle Jerry, and, gee, Mom seemed to really like him.
RORY: I cannot believe this. After all this time, your mother tells you now.
MARTY: My dad looked relieved.
RORY: He did not.
MARTY: I heard him say, "whew!"
RORY: Oh, that is amazing.
MARTY: So, what did you do over the summer?
RORY: [uncomfortable] Well, we so should have started with me.
[A student in red jacket purposefully bumps into Marty as he passes]
MARTY: Oh, sorry.
COLIN: No, seriously, you couldn't see me there?
FINN: Not everyone's staring at you, Colin.
[Colin is also walking with a blond guy: Logan and his even blonder girlfriend]
LOGAN: Hey, I know you. No, wait-wait, don't tell me. I'm seeing a uniform of some sort.
FINN: [sarcasm] Maytag repairman.
MARTY: I've bartended for you -- for your parties.
LOGAN: That's right, you have. You're a talented man. [to Rory] He makes a kick-ass margarita.
MARTY: [chuckle] thanks
LOGAN: It's good to see you again. What's your name?
MARTY: Marty. Uh, this is Rory.
LOGAN: Hi. So, assuming your services are still for hire this year, your financial situation hasn't changed at all?
MARTY: Nope.
LOGAN: Good. Okay, I'll give you a call. Where are you living now?
MARTY: Branford.
LOGAN: Oh, excellent -- Branford. All right. Good running into you.
[He exits with blond girl in tow, his friends slowly following]
COLIN: [dryly] Excellent shirt. [to Rory] I can see what you see in him.
LOGAN: Don't be an ass, Colin.
COLIN: Me? Never. I'm a friend to all people, large and very, very small. [walks off to catch up to Logan]
MARTY: I kind of hate those guys.
RORY: Really? I can't see why.
CUT TO RORY'S DORM ROOM
[ Door opens and Rory enters to see the dorm rearranged, and almost fully set up and decorated. Paris enters from one of the bedrooms.]
RORY: Wow.
PARIS: I moved some things around. I also switched our rooms. Now, mine may seem bigger, but yours gets less sun, so you don't have to worry about melanoma.
RORY: Hey.
PARIS: What?
[Rory pulls Paris into a warm hug]
RORY: Sorry.
PARIS: Thanks.
RORY: So, how are you holding up?
[Paris fusses around the room, hanging up a picture, making small adjustments.]
PARIS: I'm fine. I'm actually relieved to be anywhere that people aren't arguing over the first-edition Faulkners. His granddaughter Sarah is the worst. If she thought the casket was worth anything, she would have stuffed it in her purse.
RORY: You know Paris, you don't have to take care of all this. It's not up to you.
PARIS: I know. It's just I want his memory to be respected. [fidgets with décor]
RORY: It will be.
PARIS: I still can't believe he's gone. He left me his manuscripts.
RORY: [impressed] Wow.
PARIS: Yeah. If Sarah finds out, it's going to be the mountain girl trial all over again. Listen, I want to have a wake.
RORY: A what?
PARIS: A wake in Asher's honor here. We'll give others the chance to pay their respects, to say goodbye. People are going to want this closure. I just think it's the right thing to do.
RORY: Sure.
PARIS: Thank you. [ Cellphone rings ] Hello? Larry, Larry, no. I'm sorry. Did you take the bar or just hang out in one?
CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT PORCH - EVENING
[Lorelai exits the front door. As she turns, Luke pulls up in his truck. They both seemed stunned to see the other. Lorelai pauses on the front steps, Luke exits his truck]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Oh, hey. I was --
LORELAI: [pointing back to the door] No, I was just coming to...
LUKE: -- pick you up. Was I not supposed to?
LORELAI: No, I figured I'd meet you at the diner.
LUKE: Oooh.
LORELAI: Yeah..
LUKE: I guess we should have discussed.
LORELAI: No-no, I should have assumed -
LUKE: I mean, we u-usually --
LORELAI: Yeah, but this is a date, so the guy usually does - in the truck, and so -
LUKE: Sorry.
LORELAI: No, I'm sorry. [awkward pause] I could go back inside.
LUKE: No, no, this is fine. You're out now, so... [another awkward pause]
LORELAI: We should go.
LUKE: We should go.
[After an awkward 'who goes where?' moment, Luke guides Lorelai around the front of the truck to open the door for her]
LORELAI: You don't have to get the -
LUKE: [scoffs and opens the door. They both nervously chuckle]
LORELAI: okay.
LUKE: There you go.
LORELAI: We'll get better at this.
LUKE: Yeah.
CUT TO INTERIOR OF A HOMEY YET STYLISH TAVERN
[Luke and Lorelai enter]
LORELAI: Oh. Oh, wow. Very 'Prancing Pony'.
LUKE: This way, please. [gently guides her toward a round-tabled booth] Your table, Miss.
LORELAI: Oh. Why, thank you, sir.
[He removes his jacket and sets aside as they both slide into the booth and sit. Lorelai notices a small sign on the table.]
LORELAI: [impressed] "Reserved."
LUKE: I told you I'd planned the evening.
LORELAI: Weren't we supposed to let someone who works here seat us?
LUKE: Not necessary.
LORELAI: Is this like a Mafia thing?
LUKE: Excuse me?
LORELAI: The whole coming in, special table, reserved sign. Are you gonna have to whack someone before the soup course?
LUKE: No, I've filled my whacking quota for the week. [cringes] Dirty?
LORELAI: [wicked grin] Extremely.
LUKE: Thought so.
MAISY: [OS] Lucas!
[An older woman walks up to their table with menus]
LUKE: How you doing, Maisy?
MAISY: You just seat yourself now?
LORELAI: I told him!
[Luke stands and gives Maisy a warm hug]
MAISY: We run a nice place here, Lucas, not like that hash joint of yours. And this must be your young lady. Hello, there. I'm Maisy.
[they shake hands]
LORELAI: Hi. I'm Lorelai. I love your place.
MAISY: It used to be a whorehouse.
LORELAI: Oh - my.
MAISY: I like that it's got a tarty history. The best places do.
LORELAI: And the best people.
MAISY: 'The best people'. I like that. [calls out loudly] Buddy! [shoos Luke] Will you sit down?
LUKE: Well, you pulled me up. [sits]
[Older man walks up]
MAISY: Buddy, this is Lorelai.
BUDDY: Lorelai. Well, hello, Lorelai. [shakes hands]
LORELAI: Hello, Buddy.
MAISY: This is very exciting for us because Lucas never brings his girls here. [calls out] Lori, some sparkling water and champagne.
LUKE: And a beer.
MAISY: You're on a date, you drink champagne. You're at a ball game, you drink a beer.
LORELAI: My goodness, what a big menu.
LUKE: Don't bother looking. Whatever you order, they'll just bring you something different.
MAISY: Hey, what about the, uh - [hand gestures]
BUDDY: Oh, yeah, good. With garlic and --
MAISY: No, no, no garlic. I mean, give the boy a chance.
[Disappointed, Buddy exits]
MAISY: Lorelai, nice to meet you, and, uh, he's a special one, this guy.
LORELAI: That's the word on the street. [Maisy exits] They know you.
LUKE: Actually, I come here two, three times a week. Yeah -- breakfast, dinner, whenever I have the time.
LORELAI: Oh, my God, Luke has a 'Luke's'.
LUKE: Yeah, well, y'know. I've known Maisy and Bud my whole life. Maisy went to school with my mother.
LORELAI: Really?
LUKE: Yeah. And then later on when my dad died and I wanted to turn the hardware store into a diner, you know, Buddy really helped me out.
LORELAI: That's so nice.
LUKE: He's a good guy. He really showed me how to run a restaurant, how to order -- everything, basically. I mean, I couldn't have done it without him.
[Lorelai looks around]
LORELAI: I love this place.
LUKE: It's a great place -- very old.
LORELAI: How long have they owned it?
LUKE: Actually, the story of that is on the back of the menu.
LORELAI: Oh, cool. [flips over the menu and clears throat] Oh, look -- "Sniffy's Tavern: A story of love." Oh, a story of love. "Maisy Fortner and Bertram 'Buddy' Linds met at a high-school basketball game. She was playing, he was not. They fell in love, got married. Buddy went to work at a dairy, and Maisy worked at the school, but they dreamed to someday own a restaurant so that all of their friends and family could come and eat and visit and laugh with them every single day."
LUKE: Buddy hated working at that dairy.
LORELAI: [continues to read] "One day Sniffy, their beloved dog, ran away. Maisy and Buddy searched high and low for him. Finally they stumbled past a dilapidated old tavern that had been boarded up for years. They heard a dog howling. They forced open the door, and there was Sniffy, stuck underneath a fallen beam. Maisy and Buddy pulled Sniffy free and rushed him to the vet, where he immediately went into emergency surgery." Oh my God, did Paul Thomas Anderson write this? Edit, people.
LUKE: You don't have to read the whole thing. There's not gonna be a quiz.
LORELAI: I'm almost done. [continues reading] "Four hours later... Sniffy was dead." Sniffy was dead?! Are you serious? Where's the happy ending?
LUKE: Well, that's what happened.
LORELAI: Well, people don't read the back of the menu to find out what really happened. They read the back of the menu to be happy, to be uplifted. That's why they read the back of the menu.
LUKE: Not that many people read the back of the menu.
[waitress pours champagne into two flutes.]
LORELAI: [to waitress] Did you know about the whole Sniffy thing? [she nods]
LUKE: If it makes you feel better, Sniffy was 150,000 years old.
LORELAI: [feigns a pout] You're lying.
[Luke grins as he hands her a glass of champagne]
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: Hey, here's to you.
LORELAI: I'll drink to that. [they both sip]
LUKE: Yep, I definitely hate champagne.
LORELAI: This is nice.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: Hey, do you remember the first time we met?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: I'm just trying to remember the first time we met. It must have been at Luke's, right?
LUKE: [nods] It was at Luke's, it was at lunch, it was a very busy day, the place was packed, and this person -
LORELAI: [gasps] Ooh, is it me? Is it me?
LUKE: This person comes tearing into the place in a caffeine frenzy.
LORELAI: [gleeful] Ooh, it's me.
LUKE: I was with a customer. She interrupts me, wild-eyed, begging for coffee, so I tell her to wait her turn. Then she starts following me around, talking a mile a minute, saying God knows what. So finally I turn to her, and I tell her she's being annoying -- sit down, shut up, I'll get to her when I get to her.
LORELAI: Y'know, I bet she took that very well, 'cause she sounds just delightful.
LUKE: She asked me what my birthday was. I wouldn't tell her. She wouldn't stop talking. I gave in. I told her my birthday. Then she opened up the newspaper to the horoscope page, wrote something down, tore it out, handed it to me.
LORELAI: [dryly] God, seriously. You wrote the menu, didn't you?
LUKE: So I'm looking at this piece of paper in my hand, and under "Scorpio," she had written, "you will meet an annoying woman today. Give her coffee and she'll go away." I gave her coffee.
LORELAI: [grinning] But she didn't go away.
LUKE: She told me to hold on to that horoscope, put it in my wallet, and carry it around with me - [pulls a small scrap of paper from his wallet and holds it out to Lorelai] one day it would bring me luck.
LORELAI: [teasing] Well, man, I will say anything for a cup of coffee [unfolds the scrap and reads it with new remembrance] Um...I can't believe you kept this. You kept this in your wallet? [sees his serious expression] You kept this in your wallet.
LUKE: Eight years.
LORELAI: [touched] Eight years.
[Luke sighs and returns the precious scrap to his wallet]
LUKE: Lorelai, this thing we're doing here -- me, you -- I just want you to know I'm in. I am all in. [carefully watches her reaction] Does that, uh -- are you, uh, scared?
[Lorelai blushes with sudden shyness, but looks back and smiles.]



CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Camera pans from the main living area, with stray clothes strewn over furniture to his bed. Following their lovemaking, Luke and Lorelai lie snuggled together covered by only a thin blanket. Lorelai toys with his hand.]
LORELAI: I can't believe you kept that horoscope.
LUKE: You're just lucky I never clean out my wallet.
LORELAI: You can't take it back now. You've exposed yourself. You've been pining for me.
LUKE: [ Chuckles ] I have not been pining.
LORELAI: I'm your Ava Gardner.
LUKE: God help me. [ Sighs ] Okay. Let's get something out of the way right now. [reaches over to the nightstand and picks up a pad of paper and pencil]
LORELAI: What? What are you doing?
LUKE: Tell me what CD's to get so I don't have to hear about it.
LORELAI: Seriously?
LUKE: And skip any '80s groups where the guys dressed up like pirates. I draw the line at pirates.
LORELAI: [kisses his shoulder] This has been a really great first date.
LUKE: It only took us eight years to get here.
[They kiss and kiss again. Lorelai then taps on the pad to remind Luke about the list]
LUKE: Okay. So, U2, right?
LORELAI: Yeah, Bono is a must, and Blondie and, um, ooh - Sparks, especially the new one, plus Bowie.
LUKE: Okay, I know he dressed up like a pirate.
LORELAI: Space man.
LUKE: Space man I can deal with.
CUT TO SAME LOCATION - LUKE'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER
[Things look different. All pillows and blanket are now piled on Lorelai's side of the bed. Luke is asleep with only the edge of the sheet covering him.] [ Alarm buzzing ]
LORELAI: Mmm.
LUKE: Sorry. I forgot to turn the alarm off.
LORELAI: Bad alarm. Bad, bad alarm.
[Luke reached and turns off alarm, then scoots closer to Lorelai, who now uses him as a pillow]
LORELAI: [groggy] What time is it?
LUKE: Early.
LORELAI: Hate early. Must k*ll early.
[Luke sleepily strokes her hair and kisses the top of her head]
LORELAI: Okay. I gotta get up.
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: Work. Inn. Buy shoes. Oh, my God, I can't move. I need coffee.
LUKE: I don't have coffee up here. It's all downstairs.
LORELAI: [whimpers] Downstairs. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. [kisses his chest before slipping out of bed and donning Luke's plaid shirt]
LUKE: [remains in bed with eyes closed, half-asleep] Where are you going?
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER - BOTTOM OF STAIRS
[Humming quietly, Lorelai reaches bottom of stairs, tousled bed-hair in her face, fastening the top button of the flannel shirt. She freezes when she sees a diner-full of people all staring at her. Backs away and runs back up the stairs.]
CUT TO LUKE'S BEDROOM
[Door closes [OS]. Luke is fast asleep. Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Well, I think people are gonna know.
LUKE: [startled] What? What are you talking about? [fully awake now] Why are you wearing my shirt?
LORELAI: I put it on to go get coffee.
LUKE: Downstairs?
LORELAI: Well, you don't keep it upstairs.
LUKE: The diner's open.
LORELAI: You're kidding!
LUKE: You walked into the diner like that?
LORELAI: I didn't think the diner could open without you.
LUKE: I had Caesar open.
LORELAI: Well, he did, with a floor show.
LUKE: Okay, so, maybe nobody noticed.
LORELAI: Look at me!
LUKE: Okay, yes. Well, but you wear crazy outfits all the time.
LORELAI: They usually include pants.
LUKE: Okay, so they know. So what? I mean, they're gonna find out eventually, right?
LORELAI: Right. So, we'll hear about it for a few days.
LUKE: Few weeks.
LORELAI: Six months of hearing about it, but then it'll die down.
LUKE: We'll be used to it.
LORELAI: And everything will get back to normal, so, okay, well, they know. It's out.
LUKE: It's out. [Lorelai chuckles] Where's your coffee?
LORELAI: [indicates her clothes - err, lack of] Mm-hmm.
LUKE: [without hesitation] I'M getting your coffee.
CUT TO RORY'S DORM ROOM
[Paris rushes into the main room]
PARIS: I need more candles.
RORY: Check my trunk. I think my mom put some in there. [watches Paris stack hardcover books] That's a lot of books you got there.
PARIS: The very fact that the bookstore had any in stock shows the sad nature of American reading habits.
RORY: Do you need some help with those?
PARIS: I got this, but here -- you can put these up.
RORY: You made flyers.
PARIS: Anyone who wants to pay tribute to this great man deserves the opportunity.
RORY: I'm on it. [she exits to dorm hallway with handful of flyers]
CUT TO DORM HALLWAY
[Rory exits her dorm room. She looks for empty space on any of the nearby bulletin boards, already crammed with notices, notes and advertisements, Three students enter the dorm hall]
COLIN: Okay, Finn, last building. Please say it looks familiar.
FINN: [eagerly looking around] Ahh, uh…
LOGAN: Apparently it doesn't look familiar.
FINN: No, hold on. Hold on. Yes. Here. [walks around a corner] This is where she lives.
RORY: Excuse me. Can I help you?
LOGAN: No thanks. [follows the other two boys]
RORY: Hey.
[Rory follows the boys around the corner and see them standing before a dorm door. Hers.]
COLIN: Don't put your number. Don't put your number!
FINN: I'm not putting my number, I'm putting your number. [indicates Logan]
RORY: [confused] That's my room.
[They turn to see Rory. Logan grins]
LOGAN: Okay, put my number.
FINN: Are you sure this is your room?
RORY: I'm sure.
FINN: I could have sworn it was her room.
RORY: What's her name? Maybe I know her.
FINN: Uh, it was short.
RORY: [dryly] I can understand your disappointment, losing a potential soul mate like that, but that is my room.
LOGAN: I'm sorry about the mix-up. My friend here means no harm. He just has to learn that Guinness and blondes - they don't mix.
FINN: Redheads!
LOGAN: We sincerely apologize, and we will now leave you to finish putting up your poster of... this really old guy. [looks closer at the papers in Rory's hands]
RORY: Professor Asher Fleming.
LOGAN: What, they were out of Orlando Bloom?
RORY: Professor Fleming died last week. We're throwing him a wake.
LOGAN: Okay, so were you and Fleming - [pauses for effect]
RORY: No!
LOGAN: Sorry. Just you're putting a poster of him up in your hallway. You can see where I get the impression he's a little bit more than a teacher.
RORY: Well, he was more than a teacher. He was a great writer and an inspiration in many other things that you couldn't possibly understand.
LOGAN: [surprised] You don't like me. You don't know me, but you don't like me.
RORY: [darkly] I know you.
LOGAN: You do?
RORY: We met yesterday. With Marty.
LOGAN: Marty?
RORY: [slightly annoyed] Marty -- my friend Marty. He bartended for you.
LOGAN: Yes, Marty. I'm sorry. It slipped my mind. Of course I met you yesterday with Marty. Nice to see you again...
RORY: [exasperated] Rory!
LOGAN: Nice to see you again, Rory. You're looking well. Angry works for you.
RORY: I'm not angry, I'm just irritated.
LOGAN: By me?
RORY: Yes.
LOGAN: Because I forgot for a moment who you were?
RORY: No, because you speak to people as if they're below you.
LOGAN: People?
RORY: Marty.
LOGAN: Ah, your friend Marty?
RORY: Yes, my friend, Marty. You talked to him like he was dirt, and that's why I'm looking at you like this.
LOGAN: I'm sorry. What did I say that was so bad? I said hello and I think I said he made a kick-ass margarita
RORY: It's not what you said, it's how you said it.
LOGAN: How'd I say it?
RORY: Like Judi Dench.
LOGAN: Ouch.
RORY: Just because somebody doesn't have money or a fancy family doesn't mean they're inferior to you.
LOGAN: I agree.
RORY: And just because somebody is a bartender at a party for you and your friends, that doesn't mean that you can talk to them like a servant. [turns to leave]
LOGAN: Well...
RORY: What?!
LOGAN: I hired him. I paid him. He served. That's what a servant does.
RORY: [incredulous] Are you serious?
LOGAN: For the sake of argument.
RORY: He was doing a job.
LOGAN: A job he took willingly.
RORY: Some people have to work.
LOGAN: And I bet if you ask him he'll tell you he made excellent tips that night. Because my friends - they tend to enjoy their re-fills.
RORY: Not the point.
LOGAN: To a bartender, tips are very much the point.
RORY: Just because you pay somebody, it doesn't mean that you can speak to them as if they're beneath you.
LOGAN: Actually, the fact that this is a free country means I can speak to anyone in any manner which I choose. However, the rules of a civilized society may frown upon a certain obvious show of snobbery, so if that's your argument --
RORY: I don't have an argument.
LOGAN: I can give you a moment to formulate one if you want to continue.
RORY: I'm busy!
LOGAN: You concede.
RORY: I don't like it when people hurt my friends.
LOGAN: And you react when goaded.
RORY: I am not goaded. I am so far from goaded. Get out your compass, and I will show you how far from goaded I am.
LOGAN: I think we got a serious debater in our midst.
[one of his friends appear on the stairs]
FINN: Logan, I think we've found it.
LOGAN: Tell Marty I said hi, and I promise to remember you instantly next time. [no reaction from Rory. He gives her a winning smile] Now, tell me that wasn't fun? [ Sighs as he moves toward the stairs] Master and Commander.
RORY: [confused] The movie?
LOGAN: No, that's what I want you to call me from now on. [climbs stairs]
RORY: Ugh.
CUT TO RORY'S DORM ROOM
[Rory enters. Paris sits on sofa smoking a pipe]
PARIS: [sadly] I just wanted to smell like him again.
[Rory closes the door, joins Paris on the sofa and puts a comforting arm around her. Paris continues to puff on the pipe]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW - SAME SIDEWALK AS PREVIOUS
[Lorelai approaches her gossiping friends.]
[ Laughter ]
MRS. CASINI: You didn't! You didn't.
LORELAI: Morning, ladies. [cringes waiting for reaction]
BABETTE: Oh, morning, Sugar.
MRS. CASINI: Samson and Delilah Sapperstein got back together.
BABETTE: I'm not surprised. Those two belong together.
MISS PATTY: Well, its nice that they made up. That means they're bound to have one of their fabulous fights very soon, which we need because things are slow around here.
[Lorelai looks puzzled ]
BABETTE: I hear that.
MRS. CASINI: They're lowering the free-parking limit at the drugstore. [Lorelai looks around puzzled] You only get 20 minutes free with validation instead of 30.
BABETTE: Well, times, they are a-changin'.
[All three women nod. Lorelai backs away]
LORELAI: Well, so, I'm gonna go. I got to get to work. [hesitates, waiting for reaction]
MISS PATTY: Bye, honey.
BABETTE: Give Rory a kiss for us.
LORELAI: I will. [long pause waiting. They stare blankly back] Okay.
[The ladies resume their gossiping as Lorelai walks away slightly disappointed.]
BABETTE: Did you notice that one side of Rosella's butt implant deflated?
MISS PATTY: Well, if your doctor accepts a co-pay of… [fades]
CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN - FRONT LOBBY
[Agitated, Lorelai walks in with a cordless phone to her ear]
LORELAI: Nobody knows. I swear.
LUKE'S VOICE: How do you know?
LORELAI: Well, I walked by "Hello! Magazine" this morning. They mentioned nothing.
SCENE SWITCHES BETWEEN INN AND DINER
LUKE: Well, maybe they're just trying to be, I don't know, respectful about it.
LORELAI: Babette? Miss Patty?
LUKE: Well, maybe they're trying not to embarrass you.
LORELAI: Babette? Miss Patty?
LUKE: Well, maybe -- I'm out.
LORELAI: Has anyone mentioned it to you?
LUKE: No, but, seriously, who's gonna mention it to me?
LORELAI: Babette? Miss Patty?
LUKE: No, it's been very quiet.
LORELAI: They have to know.
LUKE: Maybe they don't care.
LORELAI: That's kind of a bummer.
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: I don't know. You at least want them to have some interest.
LUKE: Let's just look at it this way. It's out. We don't have to worry about it. We can just go on. Are we still on for tonight?
LORELAI: Liz Taylor and Richard Burton couldn't go outside without people noticing.
LUKE: Well, I'll get drunk, you gain 500 pounds, and we'll give it another go.
LORELAI: Pick me up at 7:00?
LUKE: I'll pick you up at 7:00.
LORELAI: Okay, bye.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE DINING ROOM
[Emily sits alone at the elegantly dressed table - eating alone. Tony Bennett music plays in the background. Emily dabs her mouth with an expensive linen napkin]
EMILY: Madonna Louise!
[Maid enters and clears her dinner setting]
MADONNA LOUISE: Can I get you some dessert, Mrs. Gilmore?
EMILY: No, thank you.
MADONNA LOUISE: Very good, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: And don't run the dishwasher. It's not full.
MADONNA LOUISE: I won't, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: I smelled something funny earlier in the northeast corner of the kitchen.
MADONNA LOUISE: I sprayed for ants this afternoon.
EMILY: Oh, Madonna Louise, I told you never spray that poison all over the place. You simply have to k*ll the scout ants so they don't go back and tell the rest of them where the food is.
MADONNA LOUISE: I know Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: You k*ll the scouts, or you use the chalk that we bought in Chinatown last month.
MADONNA LOUISE: Okay, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Madonna Louise?
MADONNA LOUISE: Yes, Mrs. Gilmore?
EMILY: It was a lovely omelet.
MADONNA LOUISE: Thank you, Mrs. Gilmore. [exits]
[Emily rises and blows out the candle tapers on the table. Idly wanders to the living room, and picks up her nearby book to read. Unsatisfied, she puts the book down and wanders about the room, bored. She prepares to climb the stairs to go to bed, when she hears a noise outside. Vehicle door closes, engine turns over. Curious, she walks to the window to look out. What she sees makes her gape from shock.]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW - EVENING
[Luke and Lorelai walk together across the town square toward Miss Patty's]
LUKE: How did I get rooked into this?
LORELAI: Uh, I'm irresistible?
LUKE: Yeah. Well, have I mentioned I hate town meetings?
LORELAI: No. I thought you said you hate clown bleedings, which I totally agree with.
LUKE: Oh, no. Is tonight raffle night? I can't deal with raffle night.
LORELAI: No, it's not raffle night. Look, I promise we won't stay for the whole thing. It'll be like a stop by. We'll just run in and get the headlines so I have something to tell Rory, and then we're off to the movie.
LUKE: Do not get used to me going to these town things. Just because you like them does not mean that I will ever like them or tolerate them or go to them.
LORELAI: Hmm. Other than tonight?
LUKE: Yes, other than tonight.
LORELAI: And next Thursday.
LUKE: I did not say I would go next Thursday. [ Cellphone rings ] What the hell is next Thursday?
[ Cellphone continues to ring as Lorelai grins and answers the phone]
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY'S VOICE: Lorelai? Oh, thank God I found you. [Lorelai curses silently and mouths the words "my mother" to Luke.]
LORELAI: Hi, Mom.
[She points an accusing finger to Luke, who shrugs innocently]
SCENE SWITCHES BETWEEN EMILY'S HOME AND LORELAI
EMILY: The most bizarre thing has happened. At 7:30 at night, I had just finished my dinner. I was about to go upstairs and read, and I suddenly heard a car.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
EMILY: I ran to the window just in time to see your father driving away. He was driving away at 7:30 at night.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
EMILY: [exasperated] Lorelai!
LORELAI: Was he driving backwards or with his feet?
EMILY: Where was your father going at 7:30 at night?
[Luke stands patiently listening to their conversation, tugging gently on the corner of her jacket]
LORELAI: Well, maybe he had a business meeting.
EMILY: At 7:30 at night? What, has he suddenly become a bootlegger?
LORELAI: Mom, I'm sorry. I'm about to go into a thing. Can we talk about this later? [Luke nods in agreement and pulls her closer by her jacket's corner]
EMILY: Oh, absolutely. Far be it for me to intrude on whatever vague event you're going to.
LORELAI: Great! Thanks, Mom. Bye. [click] Your fault.
LUKE: How was that my fault?
LORELAI: Because you preoccupied me with all your yammering about the meeting, so I wasn't thinking, and I didn't check to see who was calling before I answered. [grins] Boy, it's nice to finally have someone to blame.
[Lorelai giggles and Luke grins as he follows her to up the front steps.]
CUT TO TOWN MEETING INSIDE MISS PATTY'S STUDIO.
[Meeting is underway with much conversation. Andrew and Gypsy are standing in the front of the raised stage.]
ANDREW: And then looked, backed up -
GYPSY: No.
ANDREW: I did too back up.
GYPSY: You backed up. You didn't look. You got in, you turned on your car, and then you whipped out of that space like you were Lizzie Grubman.
[ Luke and Lorelai quietly sneak inside and take seats in the back of the room.]
LORELAI: Do we have timing or what?
[more arguing in the front of the room]
ANDREW: I did not.
GYPSY: Andrew, you did too.
ANDREW: I distinctly remember looking in my mirror and seeing nothing.
GYPSY: Except me.
ANDREW: I didn't see you.
GYPSY: Liar
ANDREW: I am not a liar.
[Lorelai pulls licorice from her purse and offers one to Luke]
CUT TO RORY AND PARIS' DORM ROOM
[Paris greets two boys at the open doorway. The room is crowded with people. Hard cover books are stacked everywhere.]
PARIS: Thank you for coming. Please feel free to take a book. [The boys shrug and enter the room - walking straight for the beverage table, where cups, wine bottles, beer pitchers stand atop stack of books. Marty approaches Rory]
MARTY: Hey.
RORY: Hi.
MARTY: Interesting crowd.
RORY: Yeah, most of the people have no idea they're at a wake. They think it's some weird theme party. I've spent the entire evening trying to get people to stop referring to Asher as "the old dead dude."
MARTY: Does Paris know?
RORY: Paris, thank goodness, is Paris. [Marty nods]
[Paris approaches]
PARIS: Hi, Marty. Thank you for coming. Please help yourself to a book.
RORY: The wake seems to be going well.
PARIS: It is. [looking around] I'm very pleased with the turnout. I mean, I knew he was beloved, but this is overwhelming.
[Rory sees some students carrying in a beer keg and motions quietly for Marty to get rid of them]
PARIS: You know, it's funny, but Asher died right at the height of my passion for him. I kind of wonder what would have happened if he had lived. Would I have stayed in love with him forever?
RORY: I don't know.
PARIS: He died before I could find out. Now I'll always be in love with him. He's my Mike Todd. [Rory consoles Paris with a hug]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN MEETING
[Luke watches Lorelai munch on more snacks]
LUKE: We're going to dinner after the movie.
LORELAI: I know.
[Taylor speaks from the podium]
TAYLOR: All those who think Andrew was in the wrong, arms raised. [several people raise their hands] All those who think that Gypsy was at fault, arms raised. [More hands raise] The majority rules. Gypsy is at fault for the fender bender outside the Stars Hollow Garden Center and shall be responsible for all said damages.
GYPSY: Ha! We have got to get a courthouse in this town! [sits down in a huff]
TAYLOR: All right, let's move on to the next order of business. Hmm. A very serious matter has been brought to our attention, and I would like to bring to the floor for discussion the possible negative ramifications of the inn owner and diner owner dating.
LORELAI: [ Gasps ] That's us.
LUKE: They're talking about us.
TAYLOR: Now, as you all know, the relationship we have feared for some time has emerged, and we need to carefully consider whether or not we can support this.
LORELAI: Oh, my God.
LUKE: We're sitting right here!
TAYLOR: Yes, we see you, Luke, and, as a member of the town, you are welcome to voice your opinion.
LUKE: Voice my --
TAYLOR: [gavel bang] I open the floor up for discussion. [crowd murmurs and numerous hands raise] All right. I'll start. Luke's Diner is a staple in this town. Most of us eat there on a regular basis. The Dragonfly Inn, though newer than Luke's Diner, has also become very important in our community. [Luke and Lorelai exchange looks of disbelief] The co-mingling of the owners of these two establishments can only set the stage for disaster.
LUKE: What the hell is he talking about?
LORELAI: Well he's not happy with our co-mingling.
TAYLOR: Think of the consequences. What will happen when the relationship goes sour, as, let's face it, most of Lorelai's relationships do?
LORELAI: Hey!
TAYLOR: We'll have to choose. Suddenly you'll either be a 'Luke' or a 'Lorelai', or, if you're Kirk and you can't make a decision to save your life, you'll be neither.
KIRK: He's probably right.
TAYLOR: That's bad for the economy, bad for the town. I vote against this.
LORELAI: Are they gonna make us break up?
BABETTE: I think you're over reacting, Taylor.
TAYLOR: People, do I have to remind you about Fay Wellington and Art Brush, huh? Do I? [murmurs in the crowd]
LORELAI: Uh, yeah.
BABETTE: Fay owned a flower shop, and Art owned a candy store, and they fell madly in love about 10 years ago -- big romance.
TAYLOR: And for a while, it all worked very synergistically. Flowers and candy seemed like a perfect match...
MISS PATTY: Until Art met Margie.
GYPSY: The fudge queen.
BABETTE: Ooh, that was bad.
TAYLOR: The whole town split right down the middle. Suddenly you could buy flowers or you could buy candy.
MISS PATTY: Valentine's Day was a nightmare.
KIRK: Par for the course for me.
TAYLOR: Eventually, the hostility forced Art to move.
BABETTE: Fay never married. She stopped making candy. It was very sad.
TAYLOR: And those storefronts were empty for a year. No one wanted to be there.
LORELAI: God, this sounds terrible. Maybe they have a point.
LUKE: No, they don't have a point.
LORELAI: Well, what if something happens?
LUKE: This is crazy. I don't believe that the breakup of Fay Wellington and Art Brush affected the economy of this town one bit.
TAYLOR: Well, lucky for you, I brought charts.
LUKE: You have charts concerning the romance of two people who used to live here 10 years ago?
[Lorelai's cellphone rings ]
KIRK: We think Fay still lives in the caves above the Clancys' Mill. We can't prove it, but every so often, we hear "Delta Dawn" playing over and over.
LORELAI: [quietly] Hello?
EMILY: Your father came home at 8:30. He went inside the poolhouse for five minutes, and he got back in his car, and he drove away again.
[Luke looks inquiringly and Lorelai silently mouths "my mother". Luke, satisfied returns his attention to the meeting.]
LORELAI: Mom, this is really not a good --
EMILY: Traipsing all over the place at all hours of the night.
LORELAI: Uh-huh. Mom, where are you? You sound very far away. [quietly walks outside]
CUT TO OUTSIDE TOWN MEETING
[Scene switches between Lorelai and Emily's car]
EMILY: Park Road.
LORELAI: Park Road. Why?
EMILY: I'm not gonna be the one that sits at home alone in the dark like an Italian widow. If he can go out, then I can go out, so I went out.
LORELAI: Well, good for you.
EMILY: I figured I'd have dinner. I already had dinner. But if Richard's having two dinners, then I can have two dinners, so I went to a place I used to eat at when I was in college. And do you know what I found? It's a 'Lube-And-Tune' with an X-rated T-shirt store next door.
LORELAI: Mom, this is silly. Why don't you just go home?
EMILY: I'm not gonna be the first one back.
LORELAI: Well, how long are you gonna drive around?
EMILY: Until I'm sure your father came home. Let him worry about where I was all night.
[Conversation gets louder inside at the meeting]
LORELAI: Look, I can't talk right now.
EMILY: Well, I'm not done.
LORELAI: I'll call you later.
EMILY: I could be dead later.
LORELAI: Call one of your friends.
EMILY: No one knows about the separation except you and Rory.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry, Mom. I'm in the middle of something very important.
EMILY: Well, this is important, too. Meet me for a coffee.
LORELAI: Mom, I can't, and Rory just moved in, and she's at school getting settled, so if you really can't talk to one of your friends, I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to finish this later.
EMILY: Fine. [ Beep ]
CUT TO INSIDE THE STARS HOLLOW TOWN MEETING
[ The crowd is murmuring as Lorelai returns inside and sits beside Luke. Various poster-sized charts are set up on easels.]
BABETTE: I think that map's a little off. Luke would definitely take the Northwest block 'cause it's near the fishing hole.
LUKE: Okay, that's it. I've heard enough.
[Fed up, Luke walks to the stage and yanks up the charts off their easels, and yells at the towns people]
LUKE: This is my relationship -- mine, not yours, not yours, not yours, [looks at Lorelai] yours, but not yours. Mine and hers but not - (looking pointedly at Taylor) yours! There's not gonna be any more debating about whether or not it's a good idea if we're in a relationship, 'cause we're in a relationship.
LORELAI: Show them the horoscope!
TAYLOR: But in the event of a breakup -
LUKE: There's not going to be a breakup.
GYPSY: Well, isn't he the optimistic fellow?
LUKE: Fine. In case of a breakup, I'll move. I'll close up Luke's Diner, I'll go far, far away, and that way you won't have to choose, okay? Every section in town can be pink.
TAYLOR: Can we have your word on that?
LUKE: You can have my word and a couple of middle fingers on that, Taylor.
TAYLOR: Get that down. We have his word. Leave out the part about the fingers. All right, people, it seems that the issue of Gilmore and Danes vs. Stars Hollow has been resolved. [Lorelai grins and looks around proudly] See you all next week when everyone gets fingerprinted for the government. [gavel bangs] Meeting adjourned.
[Townspeople mill out chattering among themselves. Lorelai joins Luke near the stage.]
LORELAI: Wow!
LUKE: [nervous chuckle] Yeah. You still in?
LORELAI: You bet I am. [Then, a thought causes sudden panic] Oh, my God.
LUKE: [concerned] What? What's the matter?
[Lorelai quickly pulls out her cell phone and hits speed dial. She sighs impatiently while it rings.]
RORY'S VOICE: Hello?
LORELAI: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
CUT TO THE WAKE IN RORY'S DORM ROOM.
RORY: For what?
EMILY: Rory.
[Hearing her grandmother's voice, she turns in shock. Emily is standing in the open doorway]
RORY: Grandma.
LORELAI'S VOICE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
EMILY: [walks toward Rory looking around] What is going on here?
RORY: I have to hang up now.
LORELAI'S VOICE: Have I mentioned I'm sorry?
RORY: Bye. Well, this is a surprise.
EMILY: I simply had to get out of the house and your mother told me you were home, so I thought I'd come by and say hello. [looks around] Why are there pictures of Asher Fleming everywhere?
RORY: This is a wake for Professor Fleming. He died.
EMILY: [irritated] You'd think your grandfather could have mentioned that to me, but no. I bet he'll make me go to that insufferable man's funeral, though.
RORY: He was cremated.
EMILY: Oh, thank God.
[Paris rushes up and hugs Emily]
PARIS: Emily! It means so much to me that you came.
EMILY: Well, yes. Asher was very devoted to his students. [Paris bursts into tears crying] Oh, now, there's no need to cry. Yale is full of excellent teachers. [They both sit and Emily comforts Paris. Marty approaches Rory with two plastic cups]
MARTY: Root beer?
RORY: [takes one] Yeah. Thanks, Marty, for everything. You've been such a huge help tonight.
MARTY: For you, anything. Hey, Rory?
RORY: Hmm?
MARTY: Do you -- I mean, how come you don't have a-a -- do you have a boyfriend?
RORY: What?
MARTY: I'm just curious. You don't mention anyone. There's no one here you seem to be with, so I was just wondering what the deal was.
RORY: I don't know.
MARTY: You -- okay. So, what exactly does that mean -- "I don't know"?
RORY: I don't know.
MARTY: Okay. I mean, 'cause that's usually the kind of thing you know.
RORY: I know.
MARTY: So you don't know. Okay.
RORY: Um, will you excuse me for a minute, Marty?
MARTY: Sure.
[Rory walks out of the dorm room, picking up her purse as she exits. Scene pans to Emily and Paris conversing on the sofa.]
EMILY: And then he just takes off out of nowhere at 7:30 at night. [A young man hands Emily a beverage] Thank you, Thomas. I'll need a napkin.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW FORESTER RESIDENCE - EVENING
[Rory's Toyota Prius pulls up in front of Dean's parent's home. She walks up to the front door and knocks. After a pause, it opens. Dean is surprised to see Rory. They stare at each other a few moments, then he stands aside to welcome her inside. The door closes behind them.]

OPEN IN LORELAI'S KITCHEN
[Lorelai sleepily walks in and discovers Luke busily cooking at her stove.]
LUKE: Hey, you're up.
LORELAI: Hey, you're cooking.
LUKE: Yep, making the works. Even threw a couple blintzes in there to confuse you.
LORELAI: Wow. Where did all this come from?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: The food, the pans, the bowls, the spatula.
LUKE: Food's from Doose's, pans and bowls, you had, and the spatula's mine.
LORELAI: You travel with a spatula? [pulls coffee mug out of nearby cabinet]
LUKE: Sometimes.
LORELAI: You've actually found yourself in scraping and flipping situations without the trusty spatula before?
LUKE: [Unfazed, he continues stirring food in the pan.] Your coffee should be ready in a minute.
LORELAI: [too bright smile] Smells good. Hey, Luke?
LUKE: Yep?
LORELAI: You cooking this is so sweet - .
LUKE: [steels himself and rolls his eyes] But?
LORELAI: I just figured, you know, we'd go to Luke's for breakfast.
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: Because I like Luke's breakfast.
LUKE: I am Luke.
LORELAI: I know
LUKE: This is the same stuff I make at the diner.
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: So what's the difference?
LORELAI: Well, the difference is, while you are Luke, we're not at Luke's.
LUKE: So?
LORELAI: Well, I have my things, you know? I have certain things. And one of my things is going to Luke's. And just because I now have "Dating Luke" doesn't mean I want to lose my "Cooking Luke."
LUKE: But I am cooking, and I am Luke.
LORELAI: Look, it's like Tommy Lee having a Starbucks at his house.
LUKE: [lost, but resumes cooking] What?
LORELAI: On the surface, it sounds great. But half the reason you go to a Starbucks is to go to a Starbucks, you know, to go out and see the people.
LUKE: Tommy Lee has a Starbucks in his house?
LORELAI: "Cribs," baby. Watch it.
LUKE: Like a whole Starbucks with workers and everything?
LORELAI: The point is that, while some things have changed -- and that's great -- I don't want everything to change completely.
[ Telephone ringing nearby ]
LUKE: [resigned] Okay. I'll see you at Luke's.
[Luke turns off stove and begins cleaning up as Lorelai celebrates]
LORELAI: Ah, I'll see you at Luke's! [picks up phone] Hello?
CUT TO RORY'S DORM ROOM AT YALE
[Rory scrambling around searching while talking on her phone. Scene switches between Yale and Lorelai's kitchen]
RORY: "Cultural Disenfranchisement with Women's Role Models" -- do you have it?
LORELAI: Oh, God, I hope not.
RORY: It's the book for the class I'm officially late to.
LORELAI: Oh.
[Lorelai begins searching around the kitchen as Luke continues to clear table - putting cooked food in plastic storage containers then into a sack to bring to "Luke's".]
LUKE: What are you looking for?
LORELAI: A big, boring book.
RORY: Who is that?
LORELAI: It's Luke?
LUKE: Who's that?
LORELAI: It's Rory.
RORY: Luke. It's pretty early in the morning for Luke to be there. Unless, perhaps, he woke up there.
LORELAI: Well, he did.
LUKE: "He did" what? Are you talking about me?
RORY: Man, that's weird.
LORELAI: What's weird?
LUKE: Who's weird? I'm weird?
RORY: The thought of Luke running around naked in my kitchen. It's weird.
LORELAI: Luke is not running around naked in your kitchen. He is sitting at the table, and, yes, he is naked.
LUKE: [cringes] Don't do that. Don't tell her I'm naked. I'm not naked. [calls out] I'm not naked!
RORY: [teasing] He sounds naked.
LORELAI: Well, the chairs are cold.
RORY: Huh?
LORELAI: He actually tried to make me breakfast.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Yeah, naked.
LUKE: [drops what he's doing and starts to leave] Okay, that's it, I'm gone.
LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no. Sorry, don't, no. Rory, Luke is fully dressed. He never came in the house. He just stood outside all night playing "In Your Eyes" on a boom box.
[Luke gapes and stares at the ceiling]
RORY: I have to go. If you find the book, bring it to Friday-night dinner, okay? Go back to your dirtiness. [grabs her keys and exits]
[Luke grins as Lorelai takes the paper sack from him.]
CUT TO YALE - RORY AND PARIS' DORM ROOM
[Rory enters as Paris watches movers leave a large wooden structure which dominates the main room. As they leave Paris calls after them.]
PARIS: Thanks a lot. I photographed it before you moved it, so if there's any damage, you'll be hearing from my lawyer. [to Rory] Hi.
RORY: Hi. Introduce me to your friend.
PARIS: This is a Blou printing press, 18th century.
RORY: And it's here because?
PARIS: It's Asher's. He left it to me. It's beautiful, don't you think?
RORY: Yeah. Think it goes great with the entire width of the room.
PARIS: I know it's a little cumbersome, but we don't have to leave it right here. We could move it about six inches in any direction.
RORY: Paris, we can't just leave it here.
PARIS: I have nowhere else to put it.
RORY: But -
PARIS: You have to think of the benefits of having it here.
RORY: Like?
PARIS: No one else will have one, which means it's unique, which makes us unique. Kids our age do crazy things to make themselves unique -- piercings, blue hair, Kabbalah. It will be a great conversation piece. We'll be the talk of Branford.
RORY: I believe we will.
PARIS: We can print our own newsletter, if you'd like.
RORY: [dryly] "The Eccentric Gazette". I love it.
PARIS: It's from Asher. Just try it for a while. I promise if it gets in the way, we'll get rid of it.
[Rory looks down and begins struggling to pull on a trapped object]
RORY: Paris, it's on my book bag. I'm late for class, and you put a printing press on my book bag?
[Rory unzips the bag and removes her books, stacking them in her arms]
PARIS: Well, sorry. It's from my dead boyfriend, okay? I apologize if my grief is inconveniencing you. Maybe I'll just put myself on an iceberg and float myself out to sea so that no one will have to deal with my suffering.
RORY: Well, just get that thing off my bag before you go.
CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN - LIBRARY - STREWN WITH STACKS OF BOOKS AND CARDBOARD BOXES]
[Michel enters, speaking on phone as Lorelai stocks shelves with books]
MICHEL: [speaking on cordless phone] This is outrageous, and he will call me back and it had better be in a timely manner, or I will come down there and introduce myself, and, oh, the fun we'll have. Tst! [clicks off the phone and tosses it on the nearby chair] I hate this chair!
LORELAI: What's the matter honey - Justin and Cameron having trouble again?
MICHEL: I just got off the phone with the very promising young man working as Taylor's assistant to try and talk to the man about this. [hold out official looking papers]
LORELAI: [approaches and take the papers] No, no. He rejected it again?
MICHEL: I believe that is what the bright red letters say.
LORELAI: We only need two lousy parking spaces. What is his problem?
MICHEL: Oh, the list is long.
LORELAI: This is the third time, Michel.
MICHEL: I know.
LORELAI: This is the third time that "Bus-and-Truck-Tour Mussolini" has rejected our permit.
MICHEL: [dejected] And I was there for every show.
LORELAI: What is rejection code "M"?
[Michel takes the papers and checks the reverse side]
MICHEL: "Applicant's name does not match name listed on articles of incorporation."
LORELAI: Ohh! Is he serious?!
MICHEL: Apparently you did not put your middle name on this application. However, you did put your middle name on the articles of incorporation. So the names don't match, and Taylor has no idea who you are.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm the person whose foot is going to prevent him from sitting down. That's who I am.
MICHEL: You always promise to hurt him, but then you don't. You're a Taylor tease.
LORELAI: I'm getting coffee.
MICHEL: [grunts]
CUT TO DRAGONFLY KITCHEN
[Lorelai enters and makes a bee-line to the coffee machine. Sookie, Jackson and several kitchen staff crowd around a box of tomatoes. Jackson slices one of the red fruit.]
SOOKIE: Ah, perfect timing! [waves her over]
LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, I really need some coffee.
SOOKIE: First this.
LORELAI: But it's right over there, and -- okay, what am I looking at?
SOOKIE: Jackson's tomatoes.
JACKSON: [ceremoniously passes the cutting board for everyone to take a slice] Here we go.
SOOKIE: Mmm. [Lorelai tries to slip away] Where are you going?
LORELAI: I was just gonna get a little --
SOOKIE: [hands Lorelai a big slice] Eat this. [Lorelai sighs and hurriedly takes a big bite] Isn't that the greatest tomato you've ever eaten?
LORELAI: It's good.
JACKSON: Good?
LORELAI: It's great.
JACKSON: Great?
LORELAI: All I wanted was a cup of coffee.
[Sookie instantly hands her a steaming cup] Oh, thank you. Sorry, Jackson. This is one rocking tomato.
JACKSON: This is the first batch grown in my brand-new hydroponic greenhouse.
SOOKIE: Jackson designed it himself.
JACKSON: Built most of it myself, too.
SOOKIE: You know what this means.
JACKSON: The best tomatoes on the East coast, and in October.
SOOKIE: Huh! October!
LORELAI: Heh - It sure ain't November.
JACKSON: This means year-round vegetables.
SOOKIE: I am never gonna be a slave to Mother Nature again. If I wanna make it...
JACKSON: Then I'm gonna grow it.
LORELAI: [looks at them both] Aw, you two really found each other, didn't you?
JACKSON: [sexy voice to Sookie] Do you want another piece of tomato?
SOOKIE: Do I?
[Lorelai walks off]
JACKSON: [ Chuckling as he offers her another slice ]
SOOKIE: [ Giggles as she takes a bite ] Boys, leave us, please. [ Giggles ]
[The kitchen staff immediately disperse]
CUT TO YALE - RORY AND PARIS' DORM ROOM - EVENING
[ Knock on door. Rory crosses room as Paris mutters to herself while polishing part of the ancient printing press ]
PARIS: Ben Franklin was out of his mind.
[Rory opens the door to reveal Dean standing there]
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Hey. [they kiss as Paris glances over with curiosity] So, come on in. Dean, you remember Paris.
DEAN: Yes, I do. Uh, how you doing, Paris?
PARIS: I'm fine.
DEAN: What's that?
RORY: Uh, that's a printing press. Haven't you heard? Tats are out, movable type is in.
DEAN: I've heard that.
RORY: So, my room's in there.
DEAN: Nice to see you again, Paris.
PARIS: Right back at you.
[Dean wanders back to Rory's room and shuts the door. Paris stops Rory.]
PARIS: You're back with Farmer Boy? What gives?
RORY: Paris --
PARIS: I thought he was married.
RORY: He was -- now he's not.
PARIS: Well, well -- Hoss returns. Who would've thunk?
RORY: I'm going in my room now.
PARIS: Just hold on. We have to figure this out.
RORY: Figure what out?
PARIS: You're going to be bringing boys home now. We need a system.
RORY: I'm not bringing "boys" home. I'm bringing "boy" home. That boy - that's it.
PARIS: I assume you're having sex.
RORY: [uncomfortable] Paris!
PARIS: You're having sex. Well, luckily, I just bought some noise-reducing headphones, so that'll help.
RORY: Oh boy.
PARIS: If I put the headphones on, then stuff towels under the door, that should do the trick.
RORY: Hey, if you've got extra towels to stuff, I got a location suggestion.
PARIS: How loud are you?
RORY: Paris, stop.
PARIS: Look, I don't care. I just need the information to formulate a good plan. I mean, you look all small and squeaky, but sometimes, it's exactly the bunny-looking girls who can blow the roof off the barn. I know, just give me a three-minute warning.
RORY: I'm walking away now.
PARIS: That way, I have time to put everything in place. Put headphones on, et cetera.
RORY: Bye [backs away]
PARIS: Is he gonna be coming over a lot? Probably, right? He's at his peak now, and it's probably one of the only things he's good at so...
RORY: Three-minute warning!
PARIS: Right. [quickly exits]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW - DOOSE'S MARKET
[Lane, Zach walk through the aisles with grocery cart loading it with items. Brian follows with a pad of paper writing busily.]
LANE: Bread.
BRIAN: That's $1.10, so we're at $17.33.
ZACH: And jam.
LANE: Generic.
ZACH: Yes, Mom.
BRIAN: $1.40, so we're at $18.73.
ZACH: Yo, John Nash, enough with the numbers.
BRIAN: I'm just keeping track so we don't go over.
ZACH: It's too much pressure. I can't think.
BRIAN: If we use coupons, it would stretch our money.
ZACH: Dude, the only thing more un-rock 'n' roll than coupons is that shirt you're wearing.
BRIAN: I've asked you about this shirt. You never said anything.
ZACH: We're not using coupons.
[Zach opens refrigerated case and stocks up on canned beer]
LANE: Get enough brewskis there, buddy?
ZACH: Don't worry, I'm using my own money for this.
LANE: Okay, just…
ZACH: Just what?
LANE: I'm not sure why you need all that beer, that's all.
ZACH: We've got gigs coming up, and I've kinda learned through experience that if you say to people, "Hey, wanna come back for some beers?" And you don't have beer, they get pissed and leave.
LANE: People?
ZACH: Right.
LANE: Meaning "girls."
ZACH: I would prefer it be girls.
LANE: [sarcasm] Good. Well then, stock up, then, Hef. Get some extra for Jimmy Caan.
[Jackson appears and attempts to move pass through them]
JACKSON: Hey, guys. How you doing?
LANE: [irritated] Great. Hope you're not here for beer. I think we're buying it all up.
JACKSON: I'm just here for diapers. [exits]
LANE: [to Zach] Any of your girlfriends need diapers?
ZACH: What is your problem? [exits with the cart]
LANE: Problem? No problem. [Still irritated, she opens the case again and grabs carton and follows.] Milk.
BRIAN: Lane, that was a real brand. [follows]
CUT TO DOOSE'S CHECKOUT LINE
[Taylor, the cashier counts back change to a man with child, a woman, Maggie, stands behind him in line, Jackson stands behind her. ]
TAYLOR: That makes $27, $28, $29, $30, and $10 makes $40. And here -- here, take a balloon for the little miss. Election's on Tuesday. [Man and child exit with the balloon] Morning, Maggie. How's the family?
MAGGIE: A pain in my rear. Don't say I said that.
TAYLOR: Morning, Jackson. [as he continues to unload and ring up woman's groceries]
JACKSON: Hi, Taylor.
MAGGIE: Hey, are these the best you got?
TAYLOR: Unfortunately, October's a terrible time for tomatoes.
MAGGIE: I guess I could always go with canned. I hate canned.
JACKSON: Hey, if you're needing more, Taylor, I got a nice crop of tomatoes. We could work something out.
TAYLOR: Well, that's nice of you to offer. You're growing them in that big new greenhouse, right?
JACKSON: [proudly] Built it with my own two hands.
MAGGIE: That's very industrious.
TAYLOR: Too bad about what's happening with all that.
JACKSON: Yeah… err, What?
TAYLOR: Nice cukes, though.
MAGGIE: Beautiful cukes.
TAYLOR: I love cukes in a tricolore salad -- adds a nice crunch.
JACKSON: Uh, "too bad about all" what, Taylor?
TAYLOR: Oh, you know -- the greenhouse.
JACKSON: The greenhouse? What about the greenhouse?
MAGGIE: Wait -- aren't the cukes three for $1?
TAYLOR: They're two for $1.
MAGGIE: It said three.
TAYLOR: Barry, I need a price check on cucumbers.
JACKSON: Taylor?
TAYLOR: Jackson, please. This is not the proper forum to discuss the problem with your greenhouse.
JACKSON: What problem?!
TAYLOR: Barry, if you hear me, yell "10-4."
JACKSON: I'll check the price on the stupid cucumbers! Just tell me what's up with the greenhouse!
TAYLOR: Jackson, this is my place of business. The unpleasantness with your structure will all be settled at the next town meeting. I'm not hearing a "10-4," Barry.
JACKSON: I can't go to the town meeting. I'm watching the baby.
TAYLOR: Oh, I'd get a babysitter if I was you.
BARRY: [OS]10-4.
JACKSON: You were out smoking again, weren't you, Barry?
BARRY: [OS] No.
JACKSON: Don't lie. I'll smell your breath.
BARRY: [OS] 10-4.
JACKSON: I don't like the tone of that "10-4." [Frustrated, Jackson leaves without the diapers]
CUT TO RORY'S DORM BEDROOM AND LANE'S APARTMENT BEDROOM
[Scene switches between the two locations.]
LANE: I usually like grocery shopping. This stripped it of all enjoyment.
RORY: I thought you hated grocery shopping with the guys. You always bicker.
LANE: But that's fun bickering. That's bickering we'll look back on in 20 years, slap each other on the backs and say, "wha-ho, good times."
RORY: So you'll be Dickens characters in 20 years?
LANE: You know what I mean. I know -- I have no right to be bothered by Zach luring women back to the apartment with cheap beer, because I haven't told him I like him. I mean, if I had told him I like him and he was doing that, he'd be a creep of the first order. As it is, he's just exhibiting basic guy behavior -- grunt, grunt, caveman stuff, which, to be honest, is a bit of the appeal of Zach.
RORY: So why don't you tell him?
LANE: There's a danger here.
RORY: The roommate thing.
LANE: The band thing. Need I mention the rock 'n' roll casualties from intraband dating?
RORY: I know they're numerous.
LANE: Not that there's not success stories. I mean, you've got your Cramps, your Yo La Tengo, your Kim and Thurstons.
RORY: Sonny and Cher, the Early Years.
LANE: Plus, you've got bands that have survived breakups - No Doubt.
RORY: Wish they hadn't.
LANE: X, Supertramp, The White Stripes. But in the negative, you have -
RORY: Sonny and Cher, the Later Years.
LANE: Jefferson Airplane, Fleetwood Mac. I know of two country music stars whose backup singers sh*t them in the groin.
RORY: Whoa. That's wicked hate.
[Paris bursts in Rory's room]
PARIS: My batteries are dead.
RORY: Hold on, Lane. [to Paris] Your batteries?
PARIS: For my headphones. When's Dean getting here?
RORY: Calm down Paris. We're just gonna watch a movie, and you're welcome to join us.
PARIS: Please. You're 19. Unless it's "Shoah," you two are getting carnal. [storms off]
RORY: [to Lane on the phone] Sorry. You were saying?
LANE: You've got the data. Now I need insight.
RORY: I think you should just tell him. This is not going away, so find the right moment, and see what he says. Don't mention that intraband dating stuff. Just follow your heart.
LANE: Heart. Ho, the girls in Heart really screwed things up big-time.
[ Call waiting beeps ]
RORY: Hang on. [click] Hello?
CUT TO DOOSE'S MARKET
[Dean, wearing an apron, is stocking produce. Scene switches back and forth between him and Rory.]
DEAN: Hey, it's me.
RORY: Oh, hey. You about on your way?
DEAN: Unfortunately, no. I have no way to get there.
RORY: Oh, what happened to your car?
DEAN: Uh, nothing. It's just, um... Lindsay needed it.
RORY: Oh, right.
DEAN: I don't know what for. She just needed it for some reason, and we're still kind of sharing it.
RORY: Right. Drag.
DEAN: I'll look to see if there's a bus or something.
RORY: That could take hours.
DEAN: Yeah. You want to come here?
RORY: To Stars Hollow? How?
DEAN: Drive. You got your car.
RORY: Oh, yeah, I do. Yeah, no, of course. Um, I have a car, and I'll drive to you.
DEAN: Good. I mean, if you want to.
RORY: Definitely. Yeah, and now Paris doesn't have to go get batteries.
DEAN: What?
RORY: Nothing. I'll see you in about an hour?
DEAN: My place?
RORY: See you there.
DEAN: Bye.
RORY: [clicks call waiting back to Lane] Sorry.
LANE: That's okay. Listen, I'm going to play two Rilo Kiley songs -- one pre-Jenny/Blake breakup, one post. Tell me if you hear a quality difference. [Hold up her phone to the boom box speaker]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW TOWN MEETING
[Taylor is standing on stage behind the podium deep into his lecture to the stunned townspeople]
TAYLOR: The ferocity of attack is not affected by whether they're in the larval or nymphal life stage or whether they're of the one-, two-, or three-host variety.
MISS PATTY: Oh, I hate this, Taylor. Every year.
BABETTE: Yeah, we get it -- ticks are bad.
TAYLOR: Maybe people who are new to our town -- thus, new to the town meeting -- don't know the hazards of the common tick.
GYPSY: [stands] Ticks are bad! Moving on! [sits]
TAYLOR: Don't hate the tick messenger. Hate the tick. Now, to continue…
[Taylor continues to lecture as Lorelai quietly speaks to Sookie]
LORELAI: He's ruined the word "nymphal" for me forever.
JACKSON: 4 bucks an hour to a babysitter for a tick lecture?
SOOKIE: Don't worry, honey. He'll get to us.
JACKSON: [under his breath] Waste of time.
TAYLOR: That's when a tick clamps onto his host, plunges his hypostome into the skin, and feasts on his next blood meal.
[The audience groans ]
MISS PATTY: You take too much delight in this, Taylor.
KIRK: [riveted] Go on, Taylor. He's sucking out the blood...
TAYLOR: They feed for extensive periods, and at large volumes, up to 500 times their body weight. This would be the equivalent of a 150-pound man drinking 9,000 gallons of human blood.
[The crowd groans again as Kirk nods with grave interest.]
BABETTE: Taylor, please! We get it!
MISS PATTY: Let's just vote on whatever it is you want us to vote on.
ANDREW: Before I hurl.
JACKSON: Yeah!
TAYLOR: Fine. The question before us is, shall the town incur the expense of posting signs urging residents to tuck their pants into their socks during tick season? In favor? [three people raise their hands] Opposed? [the remaining room raises their hands] The measure is defeated by an irresponsible, devil-may-care majority. Now we move on to the next item -- the matter of the town Stars Hollow vs. Land parcel 11423-A. Is the parcel holder present?
JACKSON: [stands] If that's me, I'm here.
TAYLOR: The parcel holder is present. Now, said parcel is cited as being in violation of section 423, subsection 4c, subsection 32-b, formerly known as section 424, subsection --
JACKSON: Enough!
LORELAI: Yeah, this is more painful than ticks!
TAYLOR: So, the parcel holder requests the reading of the citation be waived?
JACKSON: Waive it. Waive it. Just tell me what the hell is wrong with my greenhouse.
TAYLOR: It's built too close to the edge of your property.
JACKSON: It's miles away from the edge of my property.
TAYLOR: It's 9 1/2 feet from the edge of your property.
JACKSON: Exactly.
TAYLOR: According to town codes, no new structure can come within 10 feet of the edge of your property.
JACKSON: [scoffs] Oh, that's a technicality.
TAYLOR: No, that's the law. And as town selectman, it's up to me to see that you abide by it.
JACKSON: Unbelievable!
TAYLOR: There's a simple solution, if you want to hear it.
JACKSON: I do, yes.
TAYLOR: Just move it over six inches.
JACKSON: Oh, well, you should have just said that before.
TAYLOR: Perhaps I should have.
JACKSON: Just move the greenhouse over six inches?
TAYLOR: That's right
JACKSON: Good thing I built it on wheels so I could just scooch it over.
TAYLOR: Oh, it's on wheels?
JACKSON: No, it's not on wheels!
TAYLOR: Because wheels would have been handy.
JACKSON: I would have to tear it down to move it over six inches, Taylor!
TAYLOR: Hmmm. Too bad you didn't check with me before you built it. Could have saved you some heartache.
JACKSON: [sputtering] Up -- ah -- ah --
SOOKIE: Okay, that's not English, hon.
LORELAI: Come on, Taylor. This is ridiculous.
TAYLOR: This issue is not open for debate.
LORELAI: This is a nice man who is growing some very nice tomatoes, and you just need to oil your knees and go see the wizard and get a heart and drop this!
TAYLOR: What is this, Lorelai -- lingering resentment over the parking space issue?
LORELAI: Well come on, you rejected it because I left out my middle name. How many other Lorelai Gilmores do you know?
TAYLOR: Well, there's your daughter.
LORELAI: Okay. So you know two. Bet you can't name a third, unless you knew my grandma.
TAYLOR: I think it's about time to adjourn this meeting.
JACKSON: Oh, we're not done with this, Taylor!
TAYLOR: I think we are.
JACKSON: Don't bang that gavel!
TAYLOR: Your issue is not with me. I am merely the humble vessel for the municipal code.
JACKSON: Maybe it's time for a different vessel.
LORELAI: Where's he going with this?
SOOKIE: Not sure.
TAYLOR: A different vessel?
JACKSON: That's right. A different vessel. I'm running.
TAYLOR: For what?
JACKSON: For whatever it is you are. What are you again?
TAYLOR: Town Selectman.
JACKSON: I'm running for town selectman.
MISS PATTY: Nobody ever runs against Taylor.
GYPSY: He's our Papa Doc.
SOOKIE: Hon, shouldn't we maybe talk about this?
TAYLOR: Well, I accept the challenge. And I look forward to a lively race. Competition is the whetstone that sharpens the blade of democracy. Meeting adjourned.
LORELAI: Whatever you need, friend, I'm with you.
JACKSON: I need your vote.
LORLELAI: You got it.
[the crowd all stands and move to exit. Jackson hakes hands with a passing man.]
JACKSON: Jackson Belleville, running for selectman. I need your vote. [turns and shakes hands with Andrew] Jackson Belleville -- that's with four "L's".
ANDREW: I know. We went to high school together.
JACKSON: I still need your vote!
[they walk off as Lorelai and Sookie chat as they walk to the exit]
LORELAI: We're gonna need buttons and balloons and a slogan. How about something like -- I don't know -- "Taylor sucks like a tick"? [Sookie cringes] Don't worry. First blurb. We'll work it out.
CUT TO FORESTER RESIDENCE - EVENING
[Rory walks up to the door and rings the bell. Dean opens the door.]
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: Wow. You made good time.
RORY: No traffic.
DEAN: Come on in.
CUT TO INTERIOR OF DEAN'S PARENT'S HOME - ENTRYWAY
RORY: Your mom got a new plant.
DEAN: Yeah.
[view of living room reveals Dean's sister sitting on the sofa]
CLARA: Rory! [leaps to her feet and hugs Rory]
RORY: Oh, hi, Clara.
CLARA: I'm so glad you're back. I never liked Lindsay.
DEAN: Clara!
CLARA: I wouldn't say that to Lindsay.
DEAN: [shoos his sister] Go.
[Dean's mother enters from other room]
MAY: Dean! Was someone at the door? Rory!
RORY: Oh, hi, May. How you doing?
MAY: [forced politeness] Oh, fine. Can't complain.
RORY: Good.
MAY: [stiffly] Dean's father's in the basement. He says hello.
RORY: Oh, hello back. [uncomfortable pause] I like the...ficus.
MAY: Thank you. We're done with dinner. But if you're hungry, I could scrounge up something to zap.
RORY: I'm fine, thank you.
DEAN: We're gonna go upstairs.
MAY: All right.
RORY: Bye.
MAY: Bye.
CUT TO DEAN'S BEDROOM
[Rory and Dean enter]
RORY: It's your old room.
DEAN: In all its glory.
[Rory wanders around and sees old and new objects in his room]
RORY: [teasing] Taking up dressmaking?
DEAN: [teases back]Yeah, I am.
RORY: [plays with a toy car] Vroom.
DEAN: I thought they'd gotten rid of all that stuff by now.
[They come together in an embrace and prepare to kiss. Avril Lavigne blasts from other side of his wall. Dean pounds on the wall with his fist.]
CLARA: [OS] What?!
DEAN: It's too loud.
CLARA: No, it isn't.
DEAN: Turn it down or I'm gonna come over and do it myself.
[ Volume decreases ]
RORY: You should really get her some Ramones.
DEAN: Hey, um... I'm sorry about my mom. This whole thing's been kind of a surprise to my parents. I mean, Dad's hardly left the basement.
RORY: That's okay. It's gonna take time for everybody.
[Music volume increases and Dean, again, pounds on the wall]
CLARA: [OS] What?!
DEAN: Turn it back down! [Volume decreases. Dean chuckles.] The college student and the divorcée.
RORY: We'd make a good adult film.
[Dean caresses her hair and move closer to kiss then: Knock on door ]
MAY: [OS through closed door] Dean?
DEAN: [calls back] What, Mom?
MAY: [OS] Just wondering how late Rory's gonna be here.
DEAN: I - uh, don't know exactly.
MAY: Because I want to set the alarm before Dad and I go to bed. If the front door opens, it'll set it off.
DEAN: Uh, I'll turn it on when she leaves, Mom.
MAY: Okay. It's just that that will make the alarm panel in the bedroom chirp. That wakes us.
DEAN: Well, Clara's stereo is gonna keep you awake anyways, Mom.
CLARA: [OS] I turned it down.
MAY: Just as long as Rory doesn't stay too late, okay, Dean?
DEAN: Okay, Mom.
MAY: Okay. [after a pause, Dean's door opens a few inches and we hear footsteps fade away]
DEAN: [ Scoffs ] We could go to a movie.
RORY: I'd love that, but it's, like, 8:30 already. I have classes.
DEAN: Right. And you're not hungry?
RORY: Not really.
DEAN: Want to watch TV?
RORY: Sure.
[Rory settles on the floor, as Dean walks over to the TV and flips it on, closing his door before also settling on the floor opposite Rory. Indistinct voices on TV but no picture.]
DEAN: [ Sighs ] It takes a few minutes to warm up.
RORY: Oh, no problem.



CUT TO LUKE'S DINER - THE NEXT MORNING
[Sookie walks around the diner and shakes hands with the other customers, while she hands out buttons.]
SOOKIE: So good to meet you. And see you at the polls! [pauses at another table] Hey, aren't you two handy with a knife and fork. [ Squeals to the parents while handing out buttons] Cute kids. Yeah! There you go. Hi. Good morning. Go, Jackson. [she joins Lorelai at a decorated dining table. Lorelai is talking on her cell phone.]
LORELAI: Well, when it comes to noise pollution, Jackson Belleville hears you loud and clear. That's right. Thank you so much for your time, and we'll see you at the polls. [clicks off the phone] Okay, I think I can make it through the G's before my phone gives out.
SOOKIE: [holds up her phone] I got mine right here.
LORELAI: Great.
[Kirk enter Luke's Diner and approaches them. He is dressed in a suit and clipboard looking like a typical pollster]
KIRK: Ladies, I offer myself up to you and your cause.
LORELAI: What's this?
KIRK: I took it upon myself to poll the town, and I think you're gonna be pretty happy with the results.
SOOKIE: We are?
KIRK: Jackson is solidly in the lead.
LORELAI: Already? We just started bugging people.
KIRK: Well, I modeled my poll after the Gallup poll. The Gallup poll uses a sample of 1,005 voters to represent the 280 million people of the United States. Using that logic, the correct sampling size of the town of Stars Hollow would be 0.002. Rounding that up means one person needs to be polled, so I picked me.
LORELAI: You polled yourself?
KIRK: I was right there. Seemed like a perfect opportunity.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, first of all, thank you for dressing up to talk to yourself. And secondly, I think you're gonna need to poll more people to get a better sense of where we really are.
KIRK: Oh. Okay, I'll see what I can do.
LORELAI: Thanks, Kirk. [Kirk exit the diner] You did notice that the back of his pants are shorter than the front?
SOOKIE: How does that happen?
LORELAI: That's Kirk.
SOOKIE: It certainly is.
[Luke appears at their decorated table]
LUKE: [dryly] Hey, excuse me, but my customers aren't getting in the way of your thing here, are they?
LORELAI: [considers] Uh, no, they're fine.
LUKE: Good. 'Cause I can kick them out or close down for you, if you like.
LORELAI: [brightly] That's sweet, but we're good.
LUKE: So you'll tell me if my business is in your way?
LORELAI: You'll be the first to know. [Lane walks by carrying plates of food] Ooh, Lane. Great. Do you think your band could play at Jackson's rally next week? It's not a lot of cash, but it's a little something and it's primetime placement.
LANE: [grins] Absolutely.
[Luke shifts his feet impatiently]
LORELAI: Great. Jackson picked a song, so I'll get info that to you.
LANE: Cool. Thanks. [walks off]
LUKE: Okay, maybe you were missing my subtle sarcasm there when I mentioned my customers being in your way?
LORELAI: [continues to smile brightly] Oh, no. I didn't miss it at all.
LUKE: Get your w*r room outta here.
LORELAI: Hey, this is for a good cause. Taylor bugs you, too.
LUKE: Yes, he bugs me.
LORELAI: Okay then. We're trying to get rid of your little annoyance.
LUKE: By becoming my new little annoyance?
LORELAI: Oh, hey, the night of the rally, we're gonna need a sort of backstage gathering area.
LUKE: You cannot gather here.
[Lorelai glances out the window to the town square park]
LORELAI: But it's right across from the --
LUKE: [firmly] You cannot gather here.
LORELAI: See, the stage is right over -
LUKE: [very firmly] You cannot gather here.
LORELAI: Do you like my hair like this?
LUKE: [without skipping a b*at] Yes, and you cannot gather here.
LORELAI: Wow. Sleeping with you is getting me nothing. [forms a "zero" with her fingers for emphasis]
LUKE: Just gather your crap up, get it out. I need the tables. [walks off]
[Jackson quickly enters the diner]
JACKSON: Quick, give me the baby. [picks up Davey from the stroller and walks out grunting] Ooh. Oh ho ho.
LORELAI: Is he gonna sell it?
[They watch through the window and see people gather around Jackson "ooh-ing" over the cute baby.]
SOOKIE: Oh. That's it, Davey. Work it, work it. Do the clapping, do the clapping.
[As if on cue, Davey claps his baby hands together and the crowd "ahhs" impressed]
LORELAI: Hmm. Very "Manchurian Candidate" of you.
[Through the window, they watch Taylor exit his parlor ringing a bell]
TAYLOR: Free ice cream. Come and get your free ice cream, compliments of Taylor Doose of "Taylor's Old-Fashioned Soda Shoppe And Candy Store". [chuckles as people eagerly enter his shop] No need to rush, folks. There's plenty of free, fresh, handmade ice cream for every single registered voter in Stars Hollow.
SOOKIE: How dirty.
LORELAI: I know. All he needed were some lying swift boat captains to complete the ambush.
SOOKIE: Now we're gonna lose.
LORELAI: No, no, now -- he may have the edge, but we've got the heart.
SOOKIE: Who the hell cares about heart?
LORELAI: [determinedly] We do, and people will. We just have to stay focused and do this one vote at a time. [picks up her phone and dials]
SOOKIE: Who are you calling? Ben Affleck?
LORELAI: Oh, hello, my favorite daughter.
RORY: What do you need?
LORELAI: I need you to come home.
RORY: Now?
LORELAI: No, Tuesday.
RORY: What's on Tuesday?
LORELAI: Well, it's the town selectman elections, and we're desperate. Lane's band is playing, and I'll give you a button.
RORY: I'll be there.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: You know I'm a sucker for a good button.
LORELAI: Thanks, kid.
RORY: Tell Jackson I'm rooting for him.
LORELAI: I will. [hesitates] Um, so, how's school?
RORY: So far, so good.
LORELAI: And how's Paris?
RORY: Asher left her a 300-pound antique printing press, which she put in the common room.
LORELAI: So, same?
RORY: Exactly.
LORELAI: Great. Okay. And, um...how's Dean?
RORY: He's fine.
LORELAI: Okay, well, good.
RORY: Mom, I have to study. I'll see you Tuesday, okay?
LORELAI: Okay, see you Tuesday. [clicks off the phone] Okay, so Rory's coming back to vote. So counting her, you, me, Jackson, and Kirk, that's five.
SOOKIE: Why did you say "how's Dean?" like that?
LORELAI: Like that?
SOOKIE: [ Affected voice ] "How's Dean?"
LORELAI: I did say it like that, didn't I?
SOOKIE: Yep.
LORELAI: I don't know. I think I'm trying so hard to make Rory think I'm totally cool with the situation that I end up sounding totally freaked out by the situation.
SOOKIE: You're totally cool with the situation?
LORELAI: Well, I'm totally on my way to being totally cool with the situation.
[Dejected, Jackson enters the diner with Davey in his arms]
JACKSON: Here. Take him. He's politically useless to me.
SOOKIE: Ooh.
CUT TO DEAN'S FRONT DOOR PORCH STEPS - EVENING.
[Dean sits alone on the steps. Rory pulls up in her car and Dean eagerly gets in. They drive off.]
CUT TO A REMOTE AREA OF STARS HOLLOW WOODS
[Rory and Dean are parked. Fumbling in the darkness.]
RORY: Oow!
DEAN: Sorry.
RORY: Oh, that's okay.
DEAN: You sure?
RORY: Yeah. I'm good. Just, um... [they kiss passionately] wait.
DEAN: What?
RORY: My hair.
DEAN: [shifts] Okay. Is that --
RORY: yeah, yeah. That's good.
DEAN: [bumps his head in the cramped little car] Damn it.
RORY: Let's just shift here. [leans across him]
DEAN: What are you doing?
RORY: I'm just trying to get your seat back.
DEAN: Oh, I can do that.
RORY: Oh! See, good, okay. So I'll just get, like, up here, and then now --
DEAN: ow. Wait. Ow. Ow! [Rory returns to the drivers seat, defeated. Dean is breathing heavily.] This isn't working great.
RORY: Sorry. [ Chuckles and looks around uncomfortably]
DEAN: Yeah.
RORY: So... what do you want to do?
DEAN: I don't know.
RORY: We could try going to your house or --
DEAN: No, my parents are there.
RORY: Right. We could go to Luke's. He's dating my mom now, so I get seated right away.
DEAN: I don't want to go to Luke's.
RORY: Okay, then, I'm out. Your turn.
DEAN: Maybe you should just take me home.
RORY: Oh, okay. You know, Lane's band is playing at Jackson's rally, and I thought maybe I'd come back to town to see it. Maybe we could go together.
DEAN: No, I don't think so.
RORY: It would be fun. At the least, it could be very loud.
DEAN: No, Rory! I don't want to go parading our relationship all over town.
RORY: I didn't say -
DEAN: I don't need to rub Lindsay's nose in it any more than I already have, okay?
RORY: [stunned] I wasn't trying to rub Lindsay's nose in anything. I was just - [seeing his sullen look] I'll take you home. [starts car and drives off]
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE - INTERIOR ENTRYWAY
[Rory enters the front door and walks to the living room]
RORY: Hello?
LORELAI: [OS] Rory?
RORY: Yep.
[Rory settles on the sofa as Lorelai enters from kitchen]
LORELAI: Hey. Did I know you were coming home?
RORY: Nope.
LORELAI: That's a nice face.
[Lorelai joins her on the sofa]
RORY: I don't feel like driving all the way back to school tonight. I have to deal with James Joyce first thing in the morning. Is that okay?
LORELAI: The crashing or the dealing with James Joyce?
RORY: Crashing.
LORELAI: Absolutely. Crash away. Need a helmet?
RORY: Just a pillow.
LORELAI: So, just curious, what brings you to this neck of the woods this fine evening?
RORY: Dean had to give Lindsay the car tonight.
LORELAI: Ah.
RORY: So I came here to see him.
LORELAI: Well, you're a good girlfriend.
RORY: Well, it just made sense. I mean, I have a car.
LORELAI: [muttering under her breath] And classes first thing in the morning.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Huh?
RORY: What'd you say?
LORELAI: I said, "who wants Pop-Tarts?"
[she stands and exits]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW VOTING POLL OUTSIDE THE CURTAINED BOOTHS - EVENING
[Lorelai stands outside one of the curtained booths]
LORELAI: Oh, my God. Come on. How long is this taking you?
RORY: [exits the curtain] We do not harass the voters. This is not Florida.
SOOKIE: [emerges from the next booth] I just voted for my husband. [walks to nearby table] Gimme that sticker. When I married him, I never thought that someday he'd go into politics. Of course, his winning the line-dance championship was also a bit of a shocker, so what the hell do I know?
TAYLOR: [appears] Gee, I wonder who I just voted for. [ Chuckling ] Ah, this is a wonderful night.
[accepts a sticker] Thank you. Sookie, I just want to say good luck, and may the best man win.
SOOKIE: Yeah, you too, Taylor. [returns his "two thumbs up" as he exits] Ha ha. You know what -- this has been fun, even if we lose.
LORELAI: We're not gonna lose.
SOOKIE: Even if we do, I'm still glad we did it.
LORELAI: We're not going to lose. [to Rory] What's up with you? You taking off?
RORY: I'm gonna see Lane's band, then I'm gonna go.
SOOKIE: And I'm gonna make stew for Jackson. When he loses, he'll get stew. He likes stew.
LORELAI: He's not gonna lose.
SOOKIE: But if he does... then he'll get stew.
CUT TO BACKSTAGE AT JACKSON'S RALLY
[Lane, Gil, Zach and Brian listen to a tape playing "Believe it or Not" in a boom box and are stunned. Zach slaps the machine off.]
ZACH: This is the day the music died.
GIL: Seals & Crofts rock harder than this.
BRIAN: My mom likes this song.
LANE: It's the song Jackson picked. We have to play it.
ZACH: And then leave town immediately, because there's no way we can ever show our faces around here again.
BRIAN: We could wear masks. They wouldn't know it was us.
GIL: Dude, they wreak havoc with your hair.
LANE: And where would we get 'em?
BRIAN: My parents have a collection of wooden tiki masks they've picked up on trips. They're pretty cool. We'd have to peel the price tags off.
ZACH: I'm not wearing smelly wood on my face.
BRIAN: Well then, you come up with something.
ZACH: I say we walk because otherwise we're selling out.
GIL: We're already backstage. People will see us.
BRIAN: Not if we wear tiki masks.
ZACH: It's worth it to keep our street cred.
LANE: Look, Zach, it's for a good cause. And if, for one night, we have to give up our cool and not have girls jiggling up and down, wanting to come back to our place for sucker beer, then so be it.
ZACH: Whoa, Prohibition Sally. Part of the point of all this is appealing to chicks.
LANE: For you, not for us.
BRIAN: No, for me, too.
GIL: That's how I met my wife.
LANE: Well, then, not for me.
ZACH: Well, you're a chick.
LANE: Right, so I should know.
ZACH: I don't even know what you're talking about anymore.
GIL: We can't cancel the gig.
ZACH: Then what do we do?
GIL: We do what we do. We make rock 'n' roll. Hendrix rocked Woodstock with "The Star Spangled banner."
BRIAN: That's true.
GIL: No one saw it coming. It's a classic now. He turned it into an anthem.
LANE: It's "The Star Spangled Banner." It was kind of already an anthem.
GIL: Thanks to Hendrix.
ZACH: I'm confused.
BRIAN: So am I.
ZACH: Are we walking or what?
LANE: We're not walking.
[Lane and Gil "high five" their agreement]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER - ALL DECORATED WITH POST RALLY FESTIVITIES
[Luke approaches Lorelai from across the counter]
LUKE: Okay, I gotta get out of here. I'm going upstairs. I put out the coffee, I locked the storeroom and the fridge. [He places his diner keys in her hand and gently squeezes] Do not let anyone break anything or steal anything. And lock up when you're done.
LORELAI: [giggles] You really don't want to wait for the results?
LUKE: [dryly] I'm just afraid I'll get too emotional.
LORELAI: Good night. [Luke exits]
[Lorelai stuffs his keys into her back pocket as she watches her daughter exit the diner]
SOOKIE: [OS to Jackson] You want some more coffee?
LORELAI: [to Rory] Bye, hon.
SOOKIE: [consoling tone] How you doing, honey?
JACKSON: Oh, I'm fine.
SOOKIE: He's nervous. I can tell. His neck goes away.
JACKSON: I'm not nervous. I'm fine.
[Kirk enter the diner.]
KIRK: Where are they? Where are they? Oh, there you are. You won't believe it. Big news. [gasping out of breath]
LORELAI: Kirk, sit down.
KIRK: Can't. These aren't my pants. [Puzzled, Sookie glances at his pants] I have the results of my latest poll. I talked to every single person in town, and unanimously, they're all voting for Jackson.
SOOKIE: What?
JACKSON: Are you sure?
KIRK: I am sure. I talked to everyone except Taylor -- but I assumed he was voting for himself -- and they all told me the same thing.
SOOKIE: We're going to win? I'm gonna be the first town selectman lady.
JACKSON: I can't believe it.
LORELAI: Kirk, you're sure about this? Every single person?
KIRK: Every person except Taylor -- and even that's not a lock, 'cause hatred for Taylor runs very deep.
SOOKIE: Ooh, the rally started. Come on. Ooh, I'm so excited! I don't have to make stew! [She urges Jackson out of the diner with her. Kirk salutes Jackson and follows.
LORELAI: [ Chuckling ] Right.
[Lorelai picks up her hat and notices through the wall window, Taylor sitting alone in the dark in his parlor. He raises a can of spray whipped cream to his mouth and takes a hit. Lorelai is sad as she exits the diner - locking the door as she leaves.]
CUT TO BRIGHTLY LIT STAGE - CAMERA PANS DOWNWARD TO SEE GATHERING CROWD
[Rory mills through the crowd. Indistinct chatter - Instruments tuning. Rory approaches the stage. ]
RORY: Lane.
LANE: You're here!
RORY: Hey, I'm your groupie. But don't get any ideas. I'm saving experimentation for my junior year.
LANE: I love you.
RORY: If you need someone to stage-dive, give me a signal.
LANE: You got it.
[They part ways as Sookie walks onstage and speaks into the microphone]
SOOKIE: Hello, Stars Hollow! [the crowd all answers "Hello!"] Okay, so the man of the hour, Jackson Belleville -- [ Cheers and applause ] Oh. That's nice. Okay. Well, he's getting ready to come out here and talk to you, but before he does, I wanted to take the opportunity to say thanks -- wow. Again, wow. Okay, so thanks for all of the support and the nice thoughts. This is a great place to live, and I wouldn't want to live anyplace else the world! And now let's get this party started. I've got a real treat for you tonight. Right here, live onstage, playing one of Jackson's favorite songs of all time, put your hands together, and let's build the roof for Hep Alien!
[Camera shifts to the band. Zach counts off the b*at softly]
ZACH: One, two, three, four... [sings] look at what's happened to me I can't believe it myself
GIL: [sings] Suddenly I'm on top of the world and it shoulda been somebody else! [Music changes and becomes fast paced hard rock] Believe it or not, I'm walking on air. I never thought I would feel so free flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
ZACH: [sings] Who could it be? Believe it or not, it's just me! It's just like the light of a new day it hit me from out of the blue.
GIL: [sings] Breakin' me out of the spell I was in, makin' all my wishes come true. believe it or not, I'm walking on air [Rory waves to Lane from the audience. Sookie watches the band from off stage as Lorelai joins her. Sookie appears a bit stunned.]
SOOKIE: It's different live, I guess.
LORELAI: I just saw Taylor in the soda shop.
SOOKIE: [still watching the band] Oh, yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah, I think he knows.
SOOKIE: Knows what?
LORELAI: Knows that he's gonna lose.
SOOKIE: Really?
LORELAI: He was sitting there all alone in the dark, downing spray whipped cream. He looked devastated.
SOOKIE: Yay!
LORELAI: I know -- "yay." But it's kind of sad, isn't it?
SOOKIE: Why? He deserves it.
LORELAI: I know, but no votes? None? That's humiliating. That's "Swept Away" kind of humiliating.
SOOKIE: [unconvincing] Yeah, you're right. Too bad.
LORELAI: You're stilling "yaying" in your head, aren't you?
SOOKIE: In 5.1 surround.
LORELAI: I'll be back in a minute.
[The band continues to play while Zach and Gil singing together. Two blonde groupies at the front of the crowd jiggle and giggle to the b*at as they ogle Zach.]
ZACH AND GIL: [singing] Believe it or not! Believe it or not! Believe it or not!
GIL: [breaks out in a solo playing "The Star Spangled Banner" then…] [sings] Believe it or not! I'm walkin' on air!
CUT TO THE POLLING PLACE'S FRONT STEPS.
[Lorelai stands nervously at the steps and stops a friend]
LORELAI: Oh, Andrew. Great. Hi.
ANDREW: Hi Lorelai. Looks like it's gonna be a landslide for Jackson. Every single person I know is voting for him. You must be really happy.
LORELAI: Oh, yes, I am. Could you, um, vote for Taylor?
ANDREW: [shocked] What?
LORELAI: Jackson's still gonna win. It's hard to explain. It involves spray cream. Just trust me. Great. Thanks. [Andrew walks off and a young woman walks by] Anna, hi!
ANNA: Hi, Lorelai. Big night, huh?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, real big. Could you vote for Taylor?
CUT TO RALLY STAGE - BAND STILL PLAYING
ZACH: [sings] Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer who could it be? Believe it or not it's just me!
[The band plays a finale slam. Zach flashes a smile to the blonde groupies, much to the chagrin of Lane. The groupies squeal their delight. After their last coordinated b*at, they all come to the front stage to wave at the cheering crowd. Rory waves at Lane. Zach urges the two blondes to join him on stage.]
SOOKIE: Well, that was peppy. All right, ladies and gentlemen, what you've all been waiting for -- the man of the hour, the next town selectman of Stars Hollow, Jackson Belleville!
[The crowd cheers as Jackson walks on stage. He approaches Sookie and locks her in a passionate embracing kiss. She returns the kiss. Laughter erupts from the crowd as they break apart and face the stage grinning.]
JACKSON: Well, jeez. That was, uh... quite a welcome. Uh, thank you all for coming and supporting me in this... thing here. As I stand on this stage, looking at you all, I can't help but think... I have a job. I have a life. [Sookie glances at her husband while continuing to grin at the crowd] I don't have time to be selectman. [Sookie does a double take as her smile stales] I have a business. I have a kid. And Sookie and I are trying to have another one. [Sookie glances nervously at the quiet crowd] And the doctor has us on this schedule, and it's not flexible. And -- what was I thinking? What the hell am I doing here? I don't want to be selectman.
[After a long dramatic pause, a single voice rings out from the crowd]
MAN IN THE CROWD: [OS] An honest man!
ANOTHER MAN: [OS] Finally!
WOMAN IN CROWD: [OS] We're behind you all the way, Jackson!
ALL: [ Chanting ] Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!
[Sookie raises Jackson's hand in victory and joins the chanting]
CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
[Zach is celebrating on sofa with the two giggly blondes clinging to either side of him. Brian hovers nearby on the sofa's arm. Lane is in the kitchen scowling as she pours snacks into a bowl.]
ZACH: Whoo! Whoo! [ Howls ] Oh, man, I am flying. I mean it, I am two, three feet in the air.
BRIAN: It was tight, it was tight. [glances at Zach] That's the right term to throw in at this point, right?
CHERRY: No one plays guitar like you, Zach.
MIRA: Totally.
ZACH: It was more than just the gifts, sweetheart. It was the material.
[Lane watches from the kitchen and sullenly takes a bite from a chip.]
BRIAN: We found our sound.
ZACH: Cheese works. This is a turning point. We have to go for it.
MIRA: You are gonna be so famous.
CHERRY: Will you remember us when you're huge?
ZACH: No.
[After a pause the blondes burst out with laughter ]
CHERRY: You're awful.
BRIAN: I'm awful, too.
[They all look over at Brian with no comment. After a long pause…]
ZACH: Okay, who needs refills?
CHERRY: I do.
MIRA: Me too.
BRIAN: I'm good. [ Slurping from his beer can ]
[Zach hops up and joins Lane in the kitchen]
ZACH: Grab us a couple beers, would you?
LANE: Okay.
ZACH: What are you doing in here? Come and join the party. [samples some chip dip from a bowl]
[Lane pull two cans from the refrigerator and braces herself before turning around]
LANE: I like you, Zach. I like you as more than a bandmate and more than a friend. I like you. I have liked you for some time now, and I don't think this feeling is going to go away. I just thought you should know. Here's your beer. [she hands him the two cans, takes a big breath and exits to her bedroom]
[Stunned, Zach walks to the sofa and dumps the cans into the girls hands]
ZACH: I gotta get some air.
[the girls watch him leave, puzzled]
BRIAN: I have Ken Burns' "Jazz" on DVD, if you're into that kind of thing.
CUT TO THE RALLY CROWD NEAR THE STAGE.
[Crowd still milling around as Rory looks on. Dean appears and approaches her.]
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Hey. I didn't know you were coming.
DEAN: I'm so sorry.
RORY: It's okay.
DEAN: This who situation's turning out to be a lot harder than I thought. Not you -- just Lindsay and moving back home and my parents. I'm not handling it as well as I should be.
RORY: It's a lot, Dean. You're doing fine.
DEAN: I didn't want to yell at you like that. I worked out the car thing. That's not gonna be an issue anymore. And I had a little talk with my mom, so I think things are gonna be better now.
RORY: Okay.
[Dean leans forward and kisses Rory warmly]
DEAN: I'm sorry.
RORY: It's good. Don't worry about it. [Dean smiles at her as she looks thoughtful] Dean, can I ask you something?
DEAN: Sure.
RORY: You won't get mad?
DEAN: No, I promise.
RORY: [hesitatingly] If Lindsay hadn't found that letter... would you... um, were you going... would you still have left her?
DEAN: Yeah. [looks at Rory puzzled before chuckling ] Yeah. Yeah, of course.
RORY: [lets out a breath of relief] Okay. Good. [ Chuckles ]
[Their attention turns to the nearby stage]
MISS PATTY: Everybody, may I have your attention? The results are in. Jackson, come on out here.
JACKSON: [OS] No.
[Sookie dives behind the curtain and pulls Jackson on stage to join Miss Patty.]
MISS PATTY: [reads a small card] Okay. The votes for town selectman are as follows -- 1,114 for Jackson Belleville. 10 for Taylor Doose. [applause from the crowd] Well, we have a new town selectman, ladies and gentlemen! [Jackson snatches the card from Miss Patty and stares at it in disbelief] Jackson, would you like to say a few words to your constituency?
JACKSON: No.
[Miss Patty snatches the card back as a voice from the crowd calls out]
TAYLOR: I would. [ Crowd murmuring as Taylor climbs on stage. After shaking hands with Jackson, he turns to speak into the microphone] Friends and townspeople... today in Stars Hollow, democracy has spoken. The will of the people has prevailed, and new leadership has been instated. Your vote has counted. Free elections are a wonderful thing, a thing to be admired and cherished. Here in America, we have something else that is to be admired and cherished. It's called a recall election. [ the crowd murmurs] I look forward to this other aspect of democracy, which I believe will happen any day now, when sanity and reason have been restored to Stars Hollow. So, in closing, friends, believe me when I tell you, you will have Taylor Doose to kick around again. Thank you, and God bless.
[He waves gaily to the silent crowd, looks around a moment before exiting]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER - AFTER RALLY FESTIVITIES
[People mill around food and balloons chatting happily while "Happy Days Are Here Again" plays in the background . Jackson looks very unhappy as Miss Patty continues talking. Andrew hovers nearby.]
MISS PATTY: Jackson, now that we're done with the sidewalk issue, I would like to talk to you about the permit for expanding my dance studio to include a Tae-Bo room.
ANDREW: I have the pictures of the hedges right here. They're at least a foot above where they're supposed to be, and ruby won't cut them down.
KIRK: [walks up and pats Jackson on his shoulder] If you need someone in charge of homeland security, I am your man.
[They all begin talking at once]
MISS PATTY: I have this great idea...
ANDREW: The sun sets five minutes earlier for me 'cause her hedges are in the way.
[Lorelai watches the festivities as she grabs a bottle and two wine glasses and heads up the back stairs to Luke's apartment]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER - UPSTAIRS.
[Lorelai approaches Luke's apartment door. No light shines from within, as she knocks. After a long pause, she bends closer to peer through the frosted glass. After another pause, the door opens. A groggy-looking Luke stands there in a t-shirt and sweat pants]
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: Grabbed us a little victory champagne, and I thought -- you were asleep.
LUKE: Oh, no, no. I was just, uh, doing some bills and things.
LORELAI: Doing bills?
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: In the dark?
LUKE: Trying to - conserve.
LORELAI: So, when you went up earlier, you were going to bed. [Luke smiles sleepily] You go to bed early, which makes sense, because you get up early. And, ugh -- now I got it.
LUKE: Hey, it's no big deal. Just come on in, we'll, uh...
LORELAI: [leans over and kisses him tenderly] No, I can hold on to this till later.
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah. Good night. [mutters to self] "Goes to bed early," I gotta remember that.
[Luke leans against the door frame shifting his weight]
LUKE: Only on some nights.
LORELAI: Hey, don't you also hate champagne? [holds up glasses]
LUKE: Kind of.
LORELAI: Yeah. [ Sighs ] I'm learning, I'm learning.
[She gives him another kiss before exiting, leaving him standing alone in his doorway. Sleepily, he turns and stumbles back inside.]

OPEN IN DRAGONFLY INN
[Camera follows a member of the kitchen staff through the door into the kitchen. Sookie cuts and preps food while she and Lorelai discuss Inn issues.]
LORELAI: It's getting the word out to the business community that we're here -- that's the key.
SOOKIE: We've got to draw them in with the things that they like -- amenities.
[Lorelai pours coffee into her mug while Sookie prepares food portions]
LORELAI: What does a businessman want when they travel? Booze, and hookers. Anything else?
SOOKIE: [grins] I think that covers it.
LORELAI: We got booze. How do we get hookers?
SOOKIE: How about a banner up front that reads "Hoes up at the Dragonfly"?
LORELAI: Or we tell them Bill Maher's here.
SOOKIE: [ Gasps ] They'd come a-flocking.
LORELAI: Maybe we're in too silly a mood to be discussing such serious stuff.
SOOKIE: You think?
[Jackson enters with a laden crate of vegetables. The only thing out of place is the business suit he is wearing]
LORELAI: Oh hey Jackson, what would you do to lure more businessmen to the Dragonfly? Besides inviting Bill Maher.
JACKSON: What do I look like, the Shell Answer Man? Everybody's gotta have a piece of Jackson. Well, he's got nothing left, I tell you, nothing.
SOOKIE: [sympathetic] His town selectman duties are starting to wear on him.
LORELAI: That's why the fancy duds?
SOOKIE: He's got functions every day and meetings and hearings.
JACKSON: I tried to work in a nice su1c1de, but my schedule wouldn't allow it. [ Cellphone rings ] Ugh, That sound's death to me.
LORELAI: Don't answer it.
JACKSON: Could be a customer. Hello? [strained patience] Yes, Mrs. Cassini. I got the note about the playground equipment.
[Jackson leans against a nearby ledge while talking, and the jacket gapes to expose a bright red stain on his dress shirt.]
LORELAI: [points] Oh God, is that blood?
SOOKIE: It's tomato. It happens daily. Disrobe.
[Without hesitation, Sookie nimbly removes his tie while Jackson continues talking, then slides off his jacket and hands it to Lorelai. She efficiently begins unbuttoning his shirt.]
JACKSON: So you say your granddaughter fell off the ducky? Oh, she fell off the piggy and she whacked her arm on the ducky. Uh-huh. I see. Well, the first thing I would do is question the horsy, 'cause he's right next to the piggy and is our most reliable witness.[weak chuckle] No, there's nothing funny about that, Mrs. Cassini. Nothing whatsoever.
SOOKIE: Arms up, big boy.
[She slips the dress shirt off him, leaving him in an undershirt and begins spot-cleaning the stain at the sink. ]
JACKSON: No, a little girl being thrown from a pink, spring-loaded, bobbling piggy toy is very serious business. Yes, Mrs. Cassini. [walks off]
LORELAI: I don't think that's gonna come out.
SOOKIE: Poor guy. He's only got two dress shirts.
[She continues to rub and blot the stain.]
LORELAI: Well, maybe a big old bloodstain will help him. People will think there was an assassination attempt and be more sympathetic.
[Lorelai glances out through the kitchen door and see Dean standing in the hall. As their eyes meet, Lorelai attempts a weak wave, but Dean immediately pretends to be distracted in another direction and leaves. Lorelai is puzzled. Jackson walks up again still talking on the cell phone.]
JACKSON: I do. I hear what you're saying, Mrs. Cassini. Yes, Mrs. Cassini. I'll talk to my parks and recreation chairman and get this solved I promise. Goodbye, Mrs. Cassini.
SOOKIE: It's a goner.
JACKSON: I know how it feels. I gotta go. I got a Kiwanis luncheon.
SOOKIE: Have fun.
[she hands him back his shirt and returns to work. Jackson gathers his clothes and prepares to leave. Lorelai produces a rumpled, folded paper and offers to him.]
LORELAI: Jackson, before you go, I need your John Hancock on that there.
JACKSON: Oh yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah, just right at the bottom. I was just ordering a ton of extra, you know, vegetables and stuff. It's just to sign and confirm that I'm ordering that stuff.
[He unfolds the paper as she immediately takes interest out the window]
JACKSON: Hey, this is for those extra parking spaces you need. It's selectman business.
LORELAI: Really?
JACKSON: Et tu, former friend?
[He leaves as she calls after him]
LORELAI: I just need your signature. It's your duty. [reluctantly takes paper and pen back]
JACKSON: So impeach me.
[Sookie appears and snatches the paper from Lorelai.]
SOOKIE: I'll forge that for you.
LORELAI: Thanks.
CUT TO YALE'S BRANFORD COLLEGE CAMPUS CAFETERIA
[Richard and Rory takes their laden trays to a nearby table and sit.]
RICHARD: So Dickie high tails it to his office and e-mails me within seconds.
RORY: Dickie's the other you at your office, right?
RICHARD: Well, there's no other me.
RORY: You know what I meant, Grandpa.
RICHARD: Dickie and I share some duties. We lunch occasionally, socialize a bit. But he would cut my throat in a b*at, as I would his.
RORY: It's like Rikers Island, except everyone drives a Jag.
RICHARD: [chuckles] Well, Dickie made a mistake. He e-mailed me, thinking that I wouldn't read it for days, but I read it the minute he sent it. He figured my weekend starts at lunch on Fridays, as so many others do -- error followed by error.
RORY: That man needs to reread his Sun Tzu.
RICHARD: Anyway, that's why I am missing Friday Night dinner. Dickie and I are going to be in the Chicago office.
RORY: Well, send me a postcard.
RICHARD: I'm traveling much less, but I don't miss it. Thirty years ago, any chance I had to travel, I jumped at, but now... I'm talking a lot, aren't I?
RORY: No. I mean, yes. But it's good.
RICHARD: I don't want to be tiresome.
RORY: Grandpa, you could never tire me. This is fun.
RICHARD: Good. My valet isn't much of a conversationalist. He's the master of the monosyllable, although he can shine a shoe with the best of them. So, been reading anything good lately?
RORY: I'm very into P.G. Wodehouse right now.
RICHARD: Oh, that's great.
RORY: You?
RICHARD: Actually, I've had a personal triumph of late.
RORY: Oh, yeah? What?
RICHARD: I've just finished the sixth and final volume of "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."
RORY: [stunned] That *is* a triumph.
RICHARD: I started it in 1968. So it took only -- what? -- 36 years to finish it. But by God, I finished it.
RORY: Wow. That's quite a commitment.
RICHARD: Well, I've had a little more time on my hands lately. Not as many evenings out as there once were.
RORY: [quietly] Right. Not as many.
RICHARD: You're still getting together with your grandmother tonight, aren't you?
RORY: Uh-huh.
RICHARD: Has she mentioned her car lately?
RORY: Her car?
RICHARD: It's due for its six-month service. I hope she isn't skipping those.
RORY: I don't know. I'm happy to ask.
RICHARD: Oh, no. That's too much trouble. I'll have Robert check with her maid.
RORY: Okay.
RICHARD: He may have to use upwards of six syllables for this one. I wish him luck.
RORY: Couldn't you just ask her yourself, Grandpa? I mean, you're right there.
RICHARD: No, I don't want to be an annoyance.
RORY: Okay. But, Grandpa --
RICHARD: Chicken's getting cold.
RORY: Right.
RICHARD: I saw the most preposterous thing on TV the other night. It's been ages since I've just flipped through the channels, and the horrors to be discovered there.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER.
[Luke wipes down a clear table. Lorelai enters.]
LUKE: Hey, what brings you here?
LORELAI: Caffeine withdrawal. And I like looking at you.
[Luke returns behind the counter to fetch coffee as Lorelai approaches.]
LUKE: To go?
LORELAI: To go. [pulls open her purse]
LUKE: Don't worry about it.
LORELAI: Luke, this is your business. I've always paid, and I always should pay.
LUKE: Fine, but don't tip me. Tipping now is weird.
LORELAI: Okay. Besides, [exaggerated wink] I can tip you later.
LUKE: That was weird, too.
LORELAI: I'm a very awkward winker.
LUKE: You're never supposed to tip me, anyway.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: I'm the proprietor. You're not supposed to tip the proprietor, even when they serve you.
[hands her the tall "to-go" cup of coffee]
LORELAI: You mean all those years, that extra 20% was unnecessary?
LUKE: [scoffs] You never tipped me 20%.
LORELAI: Ooh. Now it's getting ugly.
LUKE: You were a solid 15 percenter, sometimes less if the bill got higher. Way less if you were mad at me about something.
LORELAI: [grinning] Well, it doesn't matter. I wasn't supposed to be tipping you, anyway.
LUKE: True.
LORELAI: In fact, I want a rebate.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: [dryly] You've been ripping me off for ten years.
LUKE: Have your lawyer call my lawyer.
LORELAI: Thank you [picks up her steaming coffee]
LUKE: [without pause] We still on for tomorrow night?
LORELAI: Absolutely.
LUKE: Talk to you later.
LORELAI: Bye.
CUT TO EXTERIOR OF LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai exits and almost bumps into Dean as he walks by. He is carrying his Doose's produce apron]
DEAN: Oh hi, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hi, Dean. Um, good to bump into you.
DEAN: Yeah, same here. [hesitatingly looks around] Um, you on your way back to work?
LORELAI: Yeah. You?
DEAN: Yeah. I'm going to Doose's.
LORELAI: [conversationally] You were just at the inn.
DEAN: Yeah, Tom wanted me to sand some doors down. They were getting a little warped.
LORELAI: I saw you in the hallway there, but you looked kind of busy.
DEAN: [slightly embarrassed] Yeah, I-I saw you, too.
LORELAI: Oh. [Dean looks around uncomfortably] So, how's our girl?
DEAN: Rory?
LORELAI: Yeah.
DEAN: Uh, she's good. I saw her like three days ago, or a couple days ago. But yeah, she's good.
LORELAI: Good. Well, I talked to her this morning, so I win. [chuckles and smiles] Not that it's a contest.
DEAN: [grins back] Right.
LORELAI: Well, I guess I'll see you around. Next time you're at the inn, find me. We could have some coffee and chew the fat. Sounds like a disgusting combination, but anyway come by.
DEAN: I will. Sure. Absolutely.
LORELAI: Okay.
DEAN: So have a good day.
LORELAI: You too.
[They both awkwardly part company]
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOME - ENTRYWAY
[ Doorbell rings ]
EMILY: I'll get it, Sara.
[Emily briskly approaches and opens the door.]
LORELAI: Hi, Mom.
EMILY: Come in, come in.
LORELAI: I'm sorry I'm late. Traffic was bad. Some moron coming out of Stars Hollow decided to go the speed limit, which is -- ooh! [she stares into the foyer] What the hell is that?
[A large metal boxlike structure stands in the center of the room.]
EMILY: What does it look like? It's a panic room.
LORELAI: Like Jodie Foster?
EMILY: I have no idea.
LORELAI: But it's very small. It's more like an anxiety room.
EMILY: It's for one person.
LORELAI: Huh?
EMILY: You could maybe squeeze two in.
[Lorelai approaches the large object and begins fussing with it. Opening the door and looking inside]
LORELAI: And when those two are done panicking, the next couple of panickers get a turn?
EMILY: It's primarily for me.
LORELAI: Why the foyer?
EMILY: It was supposed to go upstairs, but the boors who delivered it claimed they weren't told about the stairs, so they didn't have the right equipment.
LORELAI: Hey, let's test it out. I'm gonna get you. [raises her hands like claws]
EMILY: [disgusted] Oh, my God.
LORELAI: You better get in there, 'cause I'm a bad guy. Baah!
EMILY: Stop it.
LORELAI: I'm menacing. Panic, damn it. Come on.
EMILY: There's nothing funny about this.
[ Doorbell rings ]
LORELAI: Oh! Get in, quick! Quick!
EMILY: Stop it.
[Emily walks to the door to open it. Rory kisses Emily's cheek and enters.]
RORY: Hi, Grandma. So -- hey, what's that?
[Lorelai stands next to the heavy structure like a car show model.]
LORELAI: I know how to protect you from shrapnel and Agent Orange. Ask me how.
EMILY: It's a panic room.
RORY: Like Jodie Foster?
EMILY: What does Jodie Foster have to do with this?
LORELAI: [teasing] You need one for your dorm.
EMILY: That's not a stupid thought. It'll stop a 9-millimeter shell.
LORELAI: Handy for when Suge Knight comes for tea.
RORY: Why is it here?
EMILY: It's a long story. Come, let's have drinks and forget about the panic room. What'll you have?
LORELAI: Gin martini.
RORY: A soda with lime.
EMILY: This little rinky-dink cart has nothing.
LORELAI: Dad got the big one?
EMILY: He stole it away in the dark of night, so I'm stranded. I had our minister over a couple of days ago, and he had to go without his whiskey sour.
LORELAI: I bet he excommunicated you on the spot.
EMILY: I've got vermouth, but no gin. [sarcastic] Perfect. [calls out loudly] Sara?
[Sara, the maid, descends the stairs and approaches hurriedly]
SARA: Yes, ma'am?
EMILY: I need gin. Check everywhere.
LORELAI: Including the bathtub.
EMILY: Start with the pantry.
SARA: Yes, ma'am.
[Sara exits as Emily joins Lorelai and Rory]
EMILY: You know, the main reason I got the panic room is because I'm a woman living alone.
LORELAI: Well, let the record show I did not bring up the panic room.
EMILY: Do you know I've never lived alone? I went from my parents' house to college to Richard.
RORY: But, Grandma, you're not alone alone. Grandpa is only a few feet away.
EMILY: He might as well be a million miles away. I don't even know if your grandfather would look up from his stamp collection if he heard me scream.
RORY: That's not true.
LORELAI: Unless his nose got stuck to the stamp in the book and he physically couldn't look up. [Rory looks reprovingly at Lorelai] It happens.
EMILY: He's gone so much, he's no protection, anyway. He just left on some business trip, and it's an afterthought that he even bothered to tell me about it at all.
RORY: But he told you, so that's not an afterthought. That's a thought - a very thoughtful thought.
EMILY: I'm sure it was in some way for his own convenience.
SARA: [returns empty-handed] There's no gin anywhere, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Oh, perfect.
SARA: I'll check the bathtub now.
EMILY: That was a joke, Sara. Lorelai, please don't joke with the maids. It's not what they do.
LORELAI: Sorry.
EMILY: [to Sara] Check Mr. Gilmore's study.
SARA: Yes, ma'am. [exits]
EMILY: I should just call Richard myself and drag him away from whatever business meal he is having and make him tell me.
RORY: It's okay. Mom doesn't need a martini. [to her mother] Right?
LORELAI: Yeah. Right. I'll take what you got. What's good enough for the minister is good enough for me.
EMILY: Your hands are empty.
SARA: [returns a little more tentatively] The door to the study is locked.
EMILY: He locked the study?
LORELAI: Mom, really, I don't need gin. I'll take whatever you have.
EMILY: I don't have anything. That's the problem. Come on. [she stands up]
RORY: Come on where?
EMILY: [pulls a set of keys from the nearby bureau a walks off.] I'm not going to let Richard's business trip keep you from having the drink you want.
RORY: Grandma, wait. [Lorelai and Rory follow Emily]
CUT TO POOL HOUSE - RICHARD'S PRIMARY RESIDENCE
[Emily enters the darkened room and flips on the nearby light switch]
RORY: Should we really be doing this?
EMILY: Oh, that he can live in this squalor.
LORELAI: It's another Calcutta. Is that open sewage?
EMILY: It certainly smells like a sewer in here.
RORY: It's his cigars. That's the smell.
EMILY: It's more than cigars. It's debauchery.
LORELAI: [dryly] Yeah. Dad mentioned he had the Barbi twins up here a couple nights ago. He and his butler have a little "auto focus" thing going on.
RORY: Well, the drink cart's over there, Grandma. We can grab the gin and vamoose.
LORELAI: [shtick] No, she's got vamoose, remember? It's the gin we need. - But you know -
EMILY: He must have five packs of breath mints here. Why would a man need five packs of breath mints?
LORELAI: It could be the gorgonzola and onion diet he's on. It has its drawbacks.
RORY: Grandma, I feel kind of weird snooping like this.
[Emily slides open desk drawers and snoops before wandering across the room]
EMILY: This is my property as much as his, and when we die, it'll be yours. We're all entitled here. He's got some new books. [browses though the bookcase]
LORELAI: Hey, my Petunia Pig plate and spoon. What's it doing here?
EMILY: Oh, odds and ends wound up out here over the years.
LORELAI: This is not an odd nor an end. It's my Petunia Pig and I'm taking it.
RORY: It's not yours to take.
LORELAI: [stubbornly] Dad's not using my Petunia Pig spoon.
EMILY: I say take it.
LORELAI: Hey, Mom, what are we carrying our booty home in? Do you have a canvas bag with a big dollar sign on it?
RORY: Okay. Just to remind you once again, the drink cart is right over here. Oh, and I think I spot gin. It's brown, right?
LORELAI: I love that you think that. [spies Emily in Richard's closet] Looking for skeletons?
EMILY: I'm just looking.
RORY: Oh, man. I spilled a ton of scotch on my skirt. Who's not closing these bottles?
EMILY: Oh, my God.
LORELAI: Did you really find a skeleton?
RORY: Okay, Gin -- it's clear, it's in my hand, and it looks good enough for a minister. Let's go.
EMILY: Oh, my God. Will you look at this? [Shocked, she pulls out a vest dressed in colorful sequins]
RORY: Bright.
LORELAI: [dryly] And tasteful.
EMILY: It's a vest.
RORY: Grandpa has lots of vests.
EMILY: It's got glitter. It's a glitter vest.
LORELAI: So?
EMILY: So? Where would your father wear a vest like this? Certainly nowhere he ever would've taken me.
RORY: Grandma, it's just a vest.
LORELAI: Yeah Mom. There's tons of places he would wear that.
EMILY: Name one.
LORELAI: Okay, I'm at a loss.
EMILY: This is insane.
LORELAI: Mom, this is the place where unwanted things came to repose. Maybe it's a vest of his from the old days.
EMILY: Our days never included Richard dressing up like that gay fellow whose tiger tried to eat him. I have definitely, positively never seen this vest. This is a party vest.
LORELAI: Okay, just put it back, Mom, and let's go.
EMILY: [holds out the festive garment] You put it back.
RORY: You know, we've moved a lot of stuff around here tonight. We've got to cover our tracks.
LORELAI: Where did you find it?
EMILY: Squished in the middle, as if he was hiding it from me.
LORELAI: [mutters as she returns the vest to the closet] Can you blame him? It's hideous.
EMILY: How dare he have a vest like that.
RORY: Okay, the mints looked something like this, right?
EMILY: That devious man.
LORELAI: [pushing Emily across the room and out the door] Come on, Mom, let's go.
RORY: [sees the dish and spoon on sofa table -panics] Mom, Petunia Pig.
LORELAI: Grab it.
[Rory rushes back and snatches up the dish and spoon. She makes a small adjustment to the nearby vase before switching off the lights and following.]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER EXTERIOR - EVENING.
[ Camera POV looks inside the lighted interior. Lorelai and Rory are the only customers as busboy carries tub past. Luke is carrying food from behind counter. ]
RORY: I have never seen Grandma so singularly obsessed about a piece of clothing.
CUT TO INTERIOR OF LUKE'S DINER - LORELAI AND RORY'S TABLE
LORELAI: Not since I wore my "Gas, Grass, or Ass -- No one rides for free" t-shirt to the junior league spring tea.
LUKE: Here we go. Boysenberry pie with ice cream. Hot fudge sundae. Half a grapefruit.
RORY: I don't want a grapefruit.
LUKE: It's good for you.
RORY: Kinda my point.
LUKE: It's too late for her, but not for you. Eat it.
LORELAI: The service is very rude. No tip for you. [to Rory] In fact, he actually owes us a lot of money because we weren't supposed to be tipping him all these years.
RORY: I know. Customarily, you do not have to tip the proprietor of an establishment.
[Luke looks proudly at Rory and checks Lorelai's reaction.]
LORELAI: Why have we been tipping him all these years?
RORY: We like him?
LORELAI: Oh, that. [to Luke] Hey, bring us some coffee, and I promise this grapefruit will be eaten.
LUKE: [skeptical] Okay.
[Luke exits]
LORELAI: How long is my nose?
RORY: Very. [gobbles her ice cream]
LORELAI: What's with the scarfing?
RORY: Well, I figured since it's still early I'd stop by Dean's new place real quick and say hi. Is that okay?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. So he's out of the parents'?
RORY: Yeah. He's sleeping on his friend Kyle's couch. It's just temporary.
LORELAI: Great. You know, we could call him and have him meet us here if you want.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Yeah. Plenty of pie, ice cream, grapefruit to go around. If we twist his arm, I bet Luke will throw in some raw spinach.
RORY: I don't think it's a good idea.
LORELAI: So skip the spinach.
RORY: You know what I mean.
LORELAI: No. What?
RORY: It's been a little weird between you two.
LORELAI: No, it hasn't.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: I just ran into him today. Didn't he tell you?
RORY: Yeah. He said it was weird.
LORELAI: Well, then it was only weird on his side, 'cause it wasn't on mine.
RORY: Um-hm.
LORELAI: Hey, how about I come along with you to Kyle's? He's back from the Navy, right? We could all hang out and hear his stories. He could teach us some sea chanteys, and I could tell Dean how not weird the situation is. See? That's how unweird it is for me. I'd do that.
RORY: No. That'd be weird, too.
LORELAI: I don't like it this way.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: We all used to get together all the time for whatever and hang out. We had a great rhythm. I like Dean. I've always liked Dean. He has a great heart. I don't want it to be weird.
RORY: Neither do I. Dean doesn't either.
LORELAI: Well, then, what about tomorrow night? Let's all hook up then.
RORY: All who?
LORELAI: All of us. You know -- the gang -- the fearsome foursome. [Luke returns with two steaming coffee mugs.] How does that sound?
LUKE: How does what sound?
LORELAI: Doing something with Rory tomorrow night.
RORY: You don't have to.
LUKE: No, no really. That sounds great. We can all do something together. [nods enthusiastically to Rory]
LORELAI: Yeah. It's a great idea. There's a ground swell of support. Let's do it.
RORY: Okay, if you want.
LORELAI: Yeah, we want, right?
LUKE: Yeah. We want. [grins and nods supportively]
LORELAI: Good. [to Rory] Go run it past Dean.
LUKE: [his grin evaporates] Dean?
RORY: I'm sure I can persuade him.
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: Yeah, good. I'll see you tomorrow night. [kisses her mom's cheek]
LORELAI: Okay. See you tomorrow night.
[Luke scratches his head in bewilderment]
RORY: Bye, Luke.
[Rory exits. Luke slips into Rory's vacated chair.]
LUKE: [interrogates] Dean? Rory's seeing Dean?
LORELAI: Yeah, you knew that.
LUKE: No, I didn't.
LORELAI: Wha - Didn't I tell you?
LUKE: No. Since when?
LORELAI: Since she got back from Europe.
LUKE: I don't believe it.
LORELAI: Haven't you seen them walking around?
LUKE: No. Were you hiding it?
LORELAI: No. I just - I wasn't sure when they wanted people to know or how I should tell people without getting hammered with a bunch of questions.
LUKE: Was this before he left his wife or after? [realization] Did -- did he leave her for Rory?
LORELAI: Like those. Questions just like those.
LUKE: Sorry, it's just, you know, [futile look] Dean and Rory together again.
LORELAI: Well, you can back out if you want. I kind of Shanghaied you there.
LUKE: No. We can do it. I just have to wrap my mind around it. Dean. [gritting teeth]
LORELAI: [gestures to the grin on her face] Dean.
LUKE: Dean. All right. Well, I'll be right back. [exits back to kitchen]
LORELAI: hmm. [covertly nudges the grapefruit dish away]
CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM
[Brian is showing Zach a new song he's written. They are working on it with their guitars. Lane looks on from behind her drum set.]
BRIAN: "G."
ZACH: "G."
BRIAN: For four b*at, back to "C" major then jump to "A" minor.
ZACH: "C" minor to "A."
BRIAN: Major.
ZACH: "A" major.
BRIAN: "A" minor after "C" major, then it's back to "G."
ZACH: Yo, Kid Flash, slow down. I've got chops, but I'm not Les Paul.
LANE: Follow the chart, Zach. You wrote it all down.
ZACH: I can't look at the chart. It's depressing.
LANE: How can a chord chart be depressing?
ZACH: The title, "Brian's Song."
BRIAN: It's a working title.
ZACH: Well, it's bumming me out. It's reminding me of Billy Dee Williams and cancer. Change it.
BRIAN: I have to change a working title? Come on.
ZACH: Well, then leave it if you don't mind bumming every body out. Or change it to "Lepers Are Fun" or "Kiss My Scurvy."
[Lane walks to the paper and scratches something on it.]
LANE: Look. There. "Brian's Tune," okay? Good working title there.
BRIAN: Okay. From the "G," we go to --
ZACH: Let's take five. I gotta clear my head.
LANE: Okay. Five minutes.
[The boys set down their guitars. ]
BRIAN: I'm gonna go water the lawn. We're getting brown spots again.
ZACH: Don't over water. That's not good for it, either.
[Zach grabs a magazine and flops on the sofa, while Lane observes somewhat nervously.]
LANE: So, how you doing, Zach?
ZACH: Comme ci, comme ca.
LANE: Anything new?
ZACH: Went to the dentist. Said I'm brushing too vigorously.
LANE: [conversationally]Oh interesting. 'Cause when you're a kid, they tell you to really go at it, ya know?
ZACH: Another lie fed to our generation.
LANE: Yeah.
ZACH: And now I'm paying with eroding gums. Want to see 'em?
LANE: [grossed] I'm good. So, anything else on your mind?
ZACH: Not really. [long pause] Want a drink or anything?
[he stands and goes to the kitchen]
LANE: Nope. [sadly to herself] I want for nothing.
CUT TO KYLE'S APARTMENT
[ Doorbell rings. Kyle opens to door. ]
RORY: Hi, Kyle.
KYLE: Oh, hey, Rory. Come on in.
[Rory enters and removes her jacket. Sparsely furnished, a wall-sized poster of Bob Dylan dominates one wall. Rory is startled.]
RORY: Thanks.
KYLE: Welcome to Casa Kyle. It's not the Taj Mahal, but it's cozy. You like Dylan?
RORY: I think I better.
KYLE: [chuckles] Yeah. I listened to a lot of Dylan out at sea. He really spoke to me.
RORY: And you understood him?
KYLE: [ Laughs ] Funny.
RORY: So you look good. How you been doing?
KYLE: Great. Navy's been fantastic. Bitchin' rehab, so I'm up and running. I can drive, type 60 words a minute. You know what else?
RORY: No. What?
KYLE: This thing is a real chick magnet. [holds up his prosthetic right arm with a hook at the end] Yeah. It's the Captain Hook thing.
RORY: Well, good for you.
[Dean enters from other room]
DEAN: Hey. What are you doing here?
RORY: Bonus visit. [they kiss]
KYLE: Oh. I think I know what that means. I'm gonna make myself scarce.
RORY: No, Kyle. It's okay. We don't want to put you out.
KYLE: Don't worry, I gotta make some calls. Check my traps, if you know what I mean. Give a shout out to Cindy or Luene or maybe throw Stacy a little something.
DEAN: He's been throwing it around a lot lately.
KYLE: Everybody loves the Bionic Man. [ Cellphone rings ] That's not me. Mine plays "Superfreak."
RORY: Sorry. It's me.
KYLE: I'll leave you two to play. [he exits to the next room]
RORY: Hello?
CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT - HER BEDROOM
[scene switches between her room and Kyle's apartment. Lane is pacing around in frustration.]
LANE: Rory, listen, I like you, and I want to be more than just friends with you.
RORY: What!?
LANE: See? You reacted. That's what a person does after someone says that they like him or her, but in my case, it's him.
[Rory and Dean both move to the couch and sit]
RORY: Oh, we're talking Zach here.
LANE: The inscrutable Zach. He's driving me crazy. I gave him ample opportunity to address the issue, and all he talked about was his eroding gums.
RORY: Oh, sexy.
[Dean is attempting to nuzzle with Rory, who smiles and attempts to dodge him.]
LANE: He's really getting on my nerves, that guy. Where are you, school?
[Dean is persistent]
RORY: [giggles] No, I'm with Dean. He's staying with Kyle.
LANE: Oh, how's his hook?
RORY: Apparently it's a chick magnet.
LANE: Well, say hi to Dean.
RORY: [to Dean] Hi from Lane.
DEAN: [calls into the phone] Hi, Lane!
LANE: And call me back when you're less distracted.
RORY: I will. Keep me posted.
LANE: If there's anything to post. Bye.
RORY: Bye. [puts away phone] So, tomorrow night.
DEAN: Yeah. What time?
RORY: Well, I can get here pretty early, but I just wanted to talk about plans with you.
DEAN: Sure. What do you want to do?
RORY: How about we go on a double date with my mom and Luke?
DEAN: [looks doubtful] A double date?
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: Won't that be awkward, weird, and about 50 other things like that?
RORY: Mom and I already talked about the weird issue in detail, and it won't be. It was Mom's idea.
DEAN: You're kidding.
RORY: No. You're forgetting, we used to hang out all the time. We had fun.
DEAN: That was a long time ago.
[Dean stands and takes a couple steps away. Rory joins him.]
RORY: Yeah, but we had fun.
DEAN: I remember.
RORY: Well, so does Mom. Come on.
DEAN: [resigned] Okay.
RORY: [stands and pulls on her jacket] Good. I'm off. [they kiss]
DEAN: I hate these short visits.
RORY: They're better than none, though.
DEAN: I guess.
[Kyle returns to the room]
KYLE: Don't leave on my account, 'cause I'm outta here. A couple of my girls took the bait. I'm thinking about doing a back-to-backer.
RORY: Well, I'm not leaving on your account. [to Dean] Tomorrow? [they kiss again]
DEAN: Tomorrow.
[Dean walks her out. "Superfreak" plays. Kyle sighs and reaches for his own cell phone ]
KYLE: No rest for Kyle. [into the phone] Yeah? Hey, cool. Yeah, what are you doing around 11:30, baby? [ Laughs ] All right.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR sh*t
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE - INTERIOR - LIVINGROOM
[Lorelai, dressed in casual clothes and trendy glasses, reclines on the sofa chatting on the phone. Her brightly striped stockinged feet rest on the coffee table.]
LORELAI: So is meeting up at 6:30 cool?
RORY: Good with us. What'd you have in mind?
LORELAI: I'll surprise you with it, but it's a classic Stars Hollow slate of activities.
RORY: So we're gonna T.P. Taylor's house again?
LORELAI: Ugh. I wanted it to be a surprise. [call waiting beeps] Wait, hon. Hold on a sec.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: Lorelai, are you alone?
LORELAI: Why?
EMILY: Because I'm going to give you the code to open the panic room from the outside and I don't want to do it if you're not alone.
LORELAI: Just hanging out here with my close friend Tex Watson.
EMILY: This is not a joking matter. Can I trust you with this information?
LORELAI: Maybe not. Maybe you should give it to someone else, someone closer.
EMILY: Well, I can't trust a neighbor.
LORELAI: How about Dad?
EMILY: Oh, your father wouldn't come to my rescue if I was on fire. Besides, that vest of his is so loud he wouldn't be able to hear me screaming.
LORELAI: Okay, Mom. Give me the code, and I will keep the code safe. [Resigned, she rises and walks to the desk for pen and paper]
EMILY: Okay. Here goes. Are you ready?
LORELAI: Pen is poised.
EMILY: 1, 1, 1... 1, 1.
LORELAI: [drops the pad back on desk] Is that the code it came with?
EMILY: Well, I don't know how to change it. The men were supposed to show me, and now it's the code I'm stuck with. Did you write it down?
LORELAI: Barring an aneurysm, I think I'll remember it.
EMILY: Well, factor in an aneurysm and write it down. This is important.
LORELAI: Okay. I'm writing it down. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. [pretends to write down]
EMILY: Don't say it out loud.
LORELAI: Our football team is so great. We won, won, won, won, won.
EMILY: Everything's a joke.
LORELAI: [dryly] No, Mom, seriously. The mailman overheard. I gotta get off the phone and chase him down and whack him.
EMILY: Hide that number.
LORELAI: I will. Goodbye.
EMILY: Goodbye.
LORELAI: [clicks call waiting] I'm back. That was mom giving me the secret panic room code.
RORY: She should just give it to Grandpa.
[Lorelai returns to the couch and flops back onto it, again, resting her socked feet on the coffee table.]
LORELAI: I suggested that, but she scoffed. Those two should just divorce and get it over with.
RORY: Don't say that.
LORELAI: I was just talking.
RORY: It's not funny.
LORELAI: But this standoff between them isn't good for anybody. Mom's getting more insane and sharing the insanity with me and everybody else.
RORY: Divorce is not the answer. I can tell you for a fact that Grandpa is miserable.
LORELAI: Really? He and Jeeves seem very happy in their new modern relationship.
RORY: Grandpa misses Grandma terribly.
LORELAI: Why? He say something like that?
RORY: I just know.
LORELAI: How?
RORY: Yesterday, when we had lunch on campus, Grandpa told me that he finished "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire." Hmm? You see?
LORELAI: You want to de-Mensa the reference?
RORY: No one sits at home alone reading that book unless it's a class assignment. It just doesn't happen. It's a honking long book. It's clearly a cry for help.
LORELAI: You're very anti-intellectual.
RORY: He asked me if Grandma had taken her car in for its six-month service.
LORELAI: Hon, that's concern for her car, not for her.
RORY: No, that's concern about Grandma and her safety.
LORELAI: Why didn't you mention this to Mom at dinner? Maybe she would have been less panicked about what he's doing and the now-infamous glitter vest.
RORY: I don't want to open a can of worms.
LORELAI: How would that open up a can of worms?
RORY: If I told her what I said, I'd have to tell her I had lunch with him, a lunch I had previously not informed her of and that would have made her jealous and defensive. The less you tell Grandma, the better.
LORELAI: [She sits up with a mock gasp] By George, I think she's got it.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I have been trying to burn that into your brain since you were a baby, but you stubbornly resisted. Now a breakthrough. I'm so proud.
RORY: So 6:30, you said?
LORELAI: By the gazebo. Dress is cas.
RORY: I really, really, really hate what's going on with Grandma and Grandpa.
LORELAI: I know, hon, but it's up to them to fix it.
RORY: I guess. I'll see you tonight.
LORELAI: Okay. See you tonight. Bye-bye.
[She clicks phone off and tosses aside, then leans back to re-prop up her feet, pondering sadly]
CUT TO RICHARD'S RESIDENCE IN THE POOL HOUSE
[Richard relaxes while reading a book. Lorelai appears at the French doors and knocks. He stands to greet her.]
RICHARD: Lorelai? This is a surprise. Did we have an appointment?
LORELAI: Oh, no, I just stopped by to pick something up for Mom and apparently she's not home.
RICHARD: She's at a D.A.R. Meeting. She's always there mid-Saturday afternoons. You should know that.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I guess I forgot. Maybe one day the entire D.A.R. will go collectively wiggy and meet on a late Saturday afternoon.
RICHARD: I doubt that. Can I get you something? Water, soda?
LORELAI: No, no, thanks. I'm fine. See you have your nose in your Proust.
[They both sit]
RICHARD: Yes, have you read him?
LORELAI: Oh, I tried once. Struck out. [looks pointedly at a small dish near his chair] Whoa. That's a lot of Certs.
RICHARD: You know how that is -- you pick one up, you forget you have it. You pick up another. The cycle continues.
LORELAI: [mutters to self] Kind of like me and men.
RICHARD: What?
LORELAI: I don't know. Mom wasn't here, so there was a vacuum. [weak chuckle]
[He leans over to gather up scattered news paper ]
RICHARD: Ah. I'm sorry about the mess. My man is with his sick mother, and I'm kind of left in the lurch here.
LORELAI: Ah, your Lurch left you in the lurch. Hey, is that where that's from? You know, Lurch on the "Addams Family"? 'Cause he would leave people in the lurch?
RICHARD: I'm not familiar with the etymology of Lurch.
LORELAI: So Lurch is away, you're back from your trip. Anything else new with you?
RICHARD: Not that I can think of.
LORELAI: How have you been spending your time lately? Anything new and fancy?
RICHARD: Not really. I joined a barbershop quartet.
LORELAI: Aha!
RICHARD: What do you mean, "aha"?
LORELAI: And what does the barbershop quartet entail?
RICHARD: It's a musical group. We dress up in outfits.
LORELAI: Aha!
RICHARD: [annoyed] Stop saying that.
LORELAI: What kind of outfits?
RICHARD: Well, old-timey period things.
LORELAI: Straw hats, vests?
RICHARD: That kind of thing. And don't say "aha" again. It's loud.
LORELAI: Dad, have you talked to Mom lately?
RICHARD: Your mother has nothing to say to me.
LORELAI: That's not true. I'm sure she'd be interested in what you're doing, like the quartet thing.
RICHARD: Why?
LORELAI: [gently] Why? You were together 40 years.
RICHARD: She couldn't care less about what I do.
LORELAI: Dad, you're still her husband. And if you're filling your nights with something, I'm sure she'd be curious what you're filling them with, as you would be with her.[she observes his pensive expression] Just think about it, okay?
RICHARD: I'll tell Robert to tell your mother you were here when he gets back.
LORELAI: Bye.
[She gathers her purse and leaves, pausing at the door to smile encouragingly. Richard contemplates their words. ]



CUT TO LANE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN
[Lane, sans glasses, is rinsing her hands in sink. Zach enters with shaving cream on face. Brian soon follows with toothbrush in mouth. They are all performing their own morning routine.]
ZACH: When did the bathroom sink stop up?
LANE: It just happened. I called the landlord. He's on it.
ZACH: 'Cause we've got rights you know. This isn't Russia.
BRIAN: Can I scoot in here?
LANE: Sure.
ZACH: Don't brush too hard, dude. I'd show you my gums, but you'd puke.
BRIAN: What about flossing?
ZACH: You mean the silent k*ll? It's a rope of destruction.
BRIAN: Nothing's safe anymore.
[Brian exits to other room. Lane concentrates on finishing touches to her makeup looking in a small mirror. Zach, standing behind her, attempts to use the same mirror.]
ZACH: [calls after him while continuing to lather neck] Gentle little strokes. [to Lane] We still lack basic necessities, man. We've gotta get a plunger.
LANE: [distantly] Yeah.
ZACH: [casually] Wanna go today?
LANE: Huh?
ZACH: To get a plunger? I know a store that sells 'em used.
LANE: [turns to face him] Zach?
ZACH: Yeah?
LANE: I've changed my mind.
ZACH: [Deer in the headlights look] Huh?
LANE: I've changed my mind. I'm taking it back.
ZACH: Taking what back?
LANE: I have no feelings for you. I was confused before, that's all, but not anymore. We're roommates and bandmates, and that's it, and that's all it'll ever be. [She exits as Brian re-enters to rinse and spit toothpaste in the kitchen sink. Zach is confused and stares at his hands filled with shaving foam.]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW OUTSIDE - EVENING
[Arm in arm, Luke and Lorelai stroll through the grassy town square and pause. They both spy Rory and Dean approaching from a distance.]
LUKE: Is that them?
LORELAI: Yeah, that's Stretch and Skinny.
LUKE: [grumbles] Oh, man, he's wearing nice slacks.
LORELAI: I don't think so.
LUKE: They're creased.
LORELAI: That equals nice?
LUKE: I hate that. It's hard enough getting dressed for a date. When you're gonna double with people, it's like dressing for four.
LORELAI: Well, at least be thankful you're not wearing your penguin outfit. Then you really would have been out of place.
LUKE: This is so not a slacks evening.
LORELAI: Please stop saying slacks. That word is creepy.
LUKE: Sorry.
LORELAI: And don't mention the "S" word to them, okay? Dean is going to be uncomfortable enough as it is. [Luke nods without enthusiasm] We don't want him to think that we're judging him, or that you're inordinately interested in his pants.
[Rory and Dean walk up]
LORELAI: Hi, hi.
RORY: Hi. [mother and daughter hug and kiss affectionately]
[After a momentary awkwardness holding out hand to shake, she warmly hugs Dean.]
LORELAI: Dean. Hi. Hi.
DEAN: Oh, hi.
LORELAI: Wow, this is going to be fun.
DEAN: Yeah, absolutely.
[Luke holds out his hand in greeting.]
LUKE: How you doing, buddy?
DEAN: Yeah, good. How you doing?
[They shake hands in a manly greeting]
LORELAI: Too bad you weren't holding a trophy. That would have made a great picture.
RORY: So what's on the agenda?
LORELAI: We grab some takeout then hit the "Black, White, and Read" movie theater.
DEAN: Cool.
RORY: I miss that place. It's been forever.
LORELAI: They're playing a great movie tonight. [nudges Luke with her elbow] "Cool Hand Luke."
LUKE: Not too shabby.
RORY: Let's go get the food.
DEAN: [glances over his shoulder] Well, good timing. No line at Jojo's.
LUKE: Let's just get the stuff at my place.
LORELAI: Why?
LUKE: Same kind of food, but better.
RORY: Yours is way better.
LORELAI: [grins] That's why we're going to Jojo's.
LUKE: [clueless look to Lorelai] What?
DEAN: Allow me.
LORELAI: Take it.
DEAN: We always do Jojo's on B.W.R. Nights.
LORELAI: That's short for "Black, White, and Read" movie theater. That's our little nickname.
LUKE: [grumbles] I'm following it.
DEAN: Because your stuff is good and has to be eaten pretty quickly. If it sits around, it starts to suck.
LUKE: That's true of all food.
DEAN: Ah, But not Jojo's. Jojo's sucks to begin with, so it's no worse when you eat it later.
RORY: It's a relativity thing. Einstein and whatnot.
LORELAI: The secret is Jojo's chili. [motions with her hands] The chili acts as a seal.
RORY: Jojo's burgers could travel to China, and they'd still be just as good.
DEAN: Because they start off bad.
LORELAI: Get it?
LUKE: [deadpan] Not really.
LORELAI: Good, then let's go. [grabs his arm as they all walk off] Plus, Jojo's is cheaper.
LUKE: 'Cause it sucks.
LORELAI: I'm just saying.
RORY: Jojo is going to be so excited to be making a sale.
CUT TO THE BLACK, WHITE AND READ BOOKSTORE - MOVIE THEATER.
[Lorelai, Rory, Luke and Dean enter and look around the vacant room]
LORELAI: Hello?
LUKE: Are they open?
RORY: The sign said they were.
LORELAI: Hello?
[Startled, Kirk hops up from his sleep on the sofa]
KIRK: I have a g*n!
LORELAI: Chill out, Kirk. We're here for the movie.
KIRK: You were supposed to pay out front.
LORELAI: You weren't out front.
LUKE: Here's $20.
KIRK: That's too much.
LUKE: Keep the change.
KIRK: You can get in 16 more people for that.
LUKE: Put it towards the popcorn.
RORY: [gleefully] Let's sit.
[The guys carry greasy paper bags as they move to front of the room where a large, bright red sofa rests]
LORELAI: Yes, yes. Ooh, let's take Big Red.
RORY: [enthusiastically] Yes, Big Red.
DEAN: That's the name for the couch.
LUKE: Yes, thanks. I kind of caught onto that.
[Luke and Dean fumble to the seat assignment]
DEAN: Oh, sorry.
LUKE: No, no, no you go.
DEAN: That's okay.
LUKE: No, that's fine. It's the same down here.
[Luke shifts to the opposite end of the sofa and sits. They all settle with the girls sitting in the middle.]
LORLEAI: Cool, we have a short feature to start. "The Katzenjammer kids try to sit on the couch."
RORY: Whoa, I love the emptiness.
LORELAI: Ah, means we can talk during the movie.
LUKE: Would people being here have stopped you?
LORELAI: We would have hesitated ever so slightly.
RORY: Food, food!
[Dean and Luke open their respective bags to dispense the food inside. Kirk walks formally to the front of the room and speaks as if to a large audience]
KIRK: Hello, everybody, and welcome to the "Black, White, and Read Theater". How are we all doing tonight?
LORELAI: Good, Kirk. How are you?
KIRK: Good, I'm Kirk. I'm very proud to announce that tonight's feature presentation is the classic "Cool Hand Luke." [ Rory and Lorelai cheer ] But I'm deeply sorry to report that the first reel of the movie inexplicably caught fire earlier this evening.
RORY: Oh, no!
LORELAI: That's what happens when Richard Pryor is your projectionist.
KIRK: I can still show you the film, but you'd miss the first 25 minutes. I'd be happy to recap what you'd miss, or even act it out for you. I must say, I do a wicked George Kennedy.
[Lorelai shares her French fries with Luke.]
RORY: [politely inquires to the others] What do you think?
LUKE: [nabs another fry] First 25 minutes are pretty important.
DEAN: I agree.
LORELAI: But having Kirk reenact things can be pretty disturbing. He totally ruined "Last Tango in Paris" for me.
RORY: What are our options in place of "Cool Hand," Kirk?
KIRK: I can offer you anything from the theater's library of films.
LORELAI: What have you got?
KIRK: A series of graphically violent driver's education films or "The Adventures of Pippi Longstocking."
RORY: Pippi!
LORELAI: Yay! Pippi! "Annika, it's Pippi!"
KIRK: "Pippi Longstocking" it is. Enjoy your film. [he exits]
LORLEAI: How long has it been since we've seen "Pippi Longstocking?"
RORY: Too long.
LORELAI: That's gotta be one of our most watched films ever.
RORY: Oh, it's up there.
DEAN: I've seen it at least three times with you two.
LUKE: [absently munches on another French fry] Isn't it some kind of kids movie?
[Lorelai's head snaps to look at Luke]
LORELAI: Wait a minute. Have you never seen this movie?
LUKE: Never.
LORELAI: [gravely looks at Rory] We got us a "Pippi" virgin.
RORY: [solemnly] I didn't think there were any left.
LORELAI: [To Luke] And it's not a kids movie.
RORY: It's a classic of surrealism.
LORELAI: And bizarre cinematography.
RORY: And atonal singing.
LORLEAI: And forced acting.
[The room darkens and light from the screen reflects off their faces and the well beloved openening theme song from the movie begins. Lorleai and Rory sing along with the music.]
RORY and LORELAI: [sings] "Freckles on her nose, diddle diddle dee, a girl came riding, into town one day, diddle diddle dee, was quite a sight. It's Pippi Longstocking he ho ho ah he ha ha, it's Pippi Longstocking there's no one like her. Happy as can be, diddle diddle dippy, tells you stories you just wait and see, tra la la la la "
LUKE: What happened to her hair?
LORELAI: She's between stylists now. It's very awkward.
LUKE: Unbelievable.
[Luke then shifts his attention to Dean and Rory as they snuggle closer to each other.]
MOVIE VOICE: …A monkey and a horse, a suitcase full of golden coins and you amazed…
[Lorelai absently notices his distraction]
LORELAI: You okay?
LUKE: Yeah, yeah. Of course.
[As Lorelai's attention returns to the film, he continues to stare at Dean and Rory.]
CUT TO OUTSIDE BLACK, WHITE AND READ BOOKSTORE - STORE FRONT
[View of the storefront showing the hanging shingle proudly displaying the store's name]
CUT TO INSIDE THE "B, W AND R" THEATER ROOM
[The only four audience members are watching with intense interest.]
PIPPI: Of course I will. I'll behave just like a fine lady.
[Cuts to the movie POV - Pippy is holding a strangely spotted horse over her head using a cheap camera effect. The camera POV shifts back to the red sofa - panning from left to right.]
DEAN: Not a bad effect.
RORY: I don't think George Lucas is shaking in his boots, though.
LORELAI: I've always wanted to lift an immense quadruped over my head.
LUKE: Shh.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: I can't hear anything.
LORELAI: Oh. I'll speak up.
LUKE: Not you -- the movie.
[CHANGE TO MOVIE POV]
LITTLE TOMMY IN FILM: [holds up immense shoes with curling toes] Why do you wear such large shoes?
PIPPI: [soaks her bare feet in a large tub of water] I love wiggling my toes, and I need plenty of room.
[ Laughing as she jumps and splashes the water ]
CHILD'S VOICE: Hey, look at her.
[CHANGE TO SOFA POV]
LUKE: [curiously serious] I still don't understand why every merchant in town takes her gold coins as payment without questioning where she got them..
LORELAI: Her father's a cannibal king. Everyone knows they're lousy with gold.
LUKE: This was a book, right? I should get the book. [he glances down to see Dean snacking on the tub of popcorn] Hey, you want to pass the popcorn there, buddy?
DEAN: [sheepishly hands the tub over] Oh, yeah. Sorry.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, we're below quarter full with the tub. You guys wanna fetch a refill?
RORY: Sure. And drinks.
[Dean and Rory stand to go retrieve the snacks]
LUKE: Thanks, Rory.
[Dean and Rory stand before and obviously occupied Kirk. Dean clears his throat. ]
DEAN: Kirk? Kirk? Yo. [nudges a foot and interrupts Kirk and Lulu making out.]
RORY: Hey, Lulu.
LULU: [grins sheepishly] Hi, Rory. Hi, Dean.
DEAN: Hi. [rattles the near empty tub] We're needing more popcorn.
[Kirk hops to his feet]
KIRK: Coming up. [to Lulu] Hold that thought
LULU: I will.
KIRK: Boy, "Pippi"'s a great make-out movie. Much better than "Blood on the Highway" or "That's my Daughter's Head."
CUT TO BACK AT THE SOFA
[Lorelai and Luke absently watch the movie]
LORELAI: Hey, Cool Hand?
LUKE: Hmm?
LORELAI: Try to drop the 'tude.
LUKE: What 'tude?
LORELAI: You practically barked at Dean to pass the popcorn.
LUKE: I didn't bark at him. Besides, he was hogging it.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Say "popcorn" more nicely, please.
LUKE: I'll try.
LORELAI: Good.
LUKE: Does he have to be all over her like that?
LORELAI: Who? Kirk? It's healthy for him. His complexion has never been better.
LUKE: Dean.
LORELAI: All they were doing was holding hands.
LUKE: [dryly] Yeah. It was that innocent.
LORELAI: Unless he has a third hand, he wasn't holding anything he wasn't supposed to be holding.
LUKE: And the way he grabbed that drink from her and started slurping on it.
LORELAI: She gave it to him to drink. Come on, chill. For me. And for Rory. It's important.
LUKE: I said I will, and I will.
[Rory and Dean return with drinks and full tub of popcorn.]
LORELAI: Thanks, guys.
RORY: Mm-hmm.
[Dean hands the popcorn to Luke before sitting]
LUKE: [slightly exaggerated] Thank you, Dean.
DEAN: No problem.
[Dean continues snuggling with Rory as they all return to watching the movie. Luke's attention wanders and soon resumes watching Dean suspiciously.]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER - INTERIOR - NIGHT
[Lane wipes down the front counter. Zach enters.]
LANE: Hi, Zach.
ZACH: I got something to say.
LANE: Okay.
ZACH: You've known me for two years. You've seen the good and the bad.
LANE: [enthusiastically] Oh, yeah! [noting his serious expression] I mean, yes.
ZACH: You probably know me better than most people, including my parents. Neither of them have seen me cry during "Dances With Wolves," and you have.
LANE: What's this about, Zach?
ZACH: You, of all people, know that it takes me a while to process things, okay? You saw how long it took me to get that chord change in "Brian's Tune."
LANE: It was a tricky chord change. It wasn't your fault.
ZACH: [exasperated] Whatever. It's just the way it is. Now, I may not be fast, but that's what we're dealing with here. And this issue with me and you is going to take longer than a chord change, okay?
LANE: Sure.
ZACH: I hope you weren't expecting an "Officer and a Gentleman" kind of thing when I came in just now.
LANE: I was not expecting that.
ZACH: Good. So we clear?
LANE: Yes.
ZACH: Good. [nods and glances around unsure]
LANE: You want something to eat?
ZACH: Yes.
LANE: Name it.
ZACH: Give me a minute, okay?
LANE: Sorry. Sure. Take a minute. [She smiles quietly as she watches Zach]
[Zach stares off considering his options]
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE - EVENING
[The foursome enter front door. Luke is discussing the movie]
LUKE: Did she own that house she lived in before she rode the horse into town, or did she buy it with her gold coins?
RORY: That's a good question.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I see a prequel in the works. "The Adventures of Pippi in Escrow."
DEAN: I'd go see it.
LORELAI: So, beverages. Shout 'em out.
RORY: Water.
LUKE: Beer.
DEAN: Yeah, beer sounds good.
LUKE: [ Chuckles ] Oh, you're serious. You want a beer?
DEAN: Yeah.
LUKE: Yeah, okay. Bring him a beer. He's not driving... [under his breath] or 21.
DEAN: Fine. I won't have a beer.
LUKE: [dryly] No, buddy, go ahead. Have a beer if you want one. You're tall. You've got slacks. You can have one.
DEAN: I don't want one anymore.
LORELAI: Can I substitute something for you?
DEAN: Water, I guess.
LUKE: Put some barley and hops in it, buddy. No one's judging here.
DEAN: [firmly] Water.
RORY: We have good water here, right Mom?
LORELAI: [rapid-fire speech] Oh, yeah -- and I'll bring out a couple of extra beers, and those of us who want them can grab them as need be. Just keep an eye on Rory, or she'll grab them all for herself.
RORY: [replies with equally fast chatter] I'll try to refrain. Need help?
LORELAI: [says quickly before exiting to kitchen] No, you stay, entertain. I'll be right back.
[uncomfortable silence. The guys are looking anywhere but at each other.]
RORY: Hey, remember when you guys were on a softball team together?
[another silent pause, before Dean walks to the couch and sits. Luke examines the nearby desk.]
DEAN: It was just a pickup game.
RORY: But you guys played a neighboring town, right? I forget which one. Um... but I do remember that you guys did Stars Hollow proud. In fact, I think it's probably the best team Stars Hollow has ever thrown. Or however you would word that phrase I attempted in the proper softball vernacular.
[She removes her jacket and joins Dean on the sofa.]
LUKE: Yeah, well, I haven't played in awhile.
DEAN: [quietly] Same here.
[another long pause, before Rory attempts to break the silence by humming]
RORY: Dum de dum dum dum.
[Lorelai enters with a tray of drinks, water glasses and beer bottles. Luke takes one]
LORELAI: What's that? A song?
RORY: No, it's just dum de dum dum.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, here are the beverages. [sets tray on coffee table]
DEAN: Thanks.
LUKE: Thanks. [takes a sip]
LORELAI: [glances around the tense room.] I'll be right back.
RORY: [frantically follows] Where are you going?
[Lorelai walks to the hall closet]
LORELAI: It's time to bring out the Bop It.
RORY: [ Gasps ] Bop It! Yes, yes! Good idea.
[They return to the living room]
LORELAI: Hey, look what I found. Bop It! Who wants to play?
RORY: [exaggerated excitement] I want to play!
LORELAI: Let's all play. You guys know how to play?
DEAN: [somewhat unenthusiastically] I've played it here before.
RORY: Yeah, he has.
LORELAI: Yeah, I remember. Hey, Cool Hand.
LUKE: What is it?
LORELAI: Oh, well... each guy holds one of the handles. [Rory and Lorelai both grip a handle] And you start up, and then you do whatever it says. You twist it or pull it or Bop It until one of you's out. [Luke watches them unimpressed] Watch. I'll be yellow. You be green.
[Lorelai and Rory demonstrate the game and begin by tapping the game gripped between them.]
GAME VOICE: Twist it. [Lorelai quickly twists yellow knob]. Pull it. [Lorelai pulls another knob] Bop it. [Lorelai reacts before Rory can move.]. Yellow. [switches to Rory's turn ]. Flick it. [Rory hesitates… ]. Ow! [Lorelai grins as Rory is defeated]
LORELAI: Okay, you try it. [to Luke and Dean, neither look impressed.]
RORY: Come on. [encouragingly to Dean]
LORELAI: It looks like Luke is green, and Dean is yellow.
[Lorelai position the two guys and hand them the game before returning to the sofa. Both girls sit.]
RORY: We've got ourselves a contest here.
LORELAI: Yep. [The two men stand facing each other without reacting]
DEAN: You wanna do a practice run?
LUKE: It's not that complicated.
DEAN: Okay. Here we go. [he activates the game]
GAME VOICE: Twist it. [Dean twists the yellow knob ] Spin it. [ Luke spins another knob]. Pull it. [Dean hurriedly pulls another knob]. Pull it. [Dean quickly reacts as they both struggle with the plastic game]. Flick it. [Luke reacts quickly. They both struggle harder as they grip the game.].
LORELAI: Don't hurt the Bop It, guys. It's got feelings too.
GAME VOICE: Pull it. [Luke quickly reacts]. Bop it. [Luke reacts again roughly].
RORY: Looks like it's a draw.
LORELAI: Good going, guys. Why don't you take a break? [but they continue playing determinedly.]
GAME VOICE: Green. Twist it. Twist it. Twist it. Bop it. [Dean misses a turn] Ow! Green wins!
LUKE: [taunting as he waves the plastic toy] Yeah! In your face! In your face!
DEAN: Fine. You won.
LUKE: [gloating] I hammered you, buddy.
DEAN: It's just a stupid game.
LUKE: Says the loser. [He walks off. The girls both look very unhappy.]
DEAN: [shrugs to the girls] I gotta go.
RORY: Already? [she stands to follow him to the door]
DEAN: Yeah, it's getting late. Thank you, Lorelai. Thanks for everything.
LORELAI: [warmly] You're welcome, Dean. Anytime.
[near the front door:]
DEAN: [quietly] I'll call you later.
RORY: Okay. [they kiss] Yeah, call me.
[Dean exits and Rory turns around with a determined look]
RORY: Thanks a lot.
LUKE: What did I do?
LORELAI: Rory...
RORY: We shouldn't have gone out like this if people didn't want to.
LUKE: No, Rory, I wanted to.
RORY: You made no effort.
LUKE: I did. I swear.
LORELAI: Look, we can talk about this later.
LUKE: He had some sort of chip on his shoulder.
RORY: Oh, come on, Luke. You're the reason we had to pull out the Bop It.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Bop It's what we bring out for social gatherings that need mouth to mouth.
RORY: I'm going back to school. [grabs her jacket and pull it on]
LUKE: Rory, wait. I feel awful here.
RORY: No, it's okay. Whatever. Bye, Mom. [gives her a quick kiss]
LORELAI: Bye, honey. Drive safely.
LUKE: [helplessly watches her leave] Yeah, drive safe. [ Sighs ] I feel awful.
[He sits on the sofa stewing]
LORELAI: Well, it's -- you know, it's my fault. I forced this.
LUKE: It's not your fault. I shouldn't have said yes to a double date.
LORELAI: Well, I wanted to do this.
LUKE: But I can't be around that guy. I knew that, and I said yes anyway.
LORELAI: Why can't you be around him?
[He jumps up and starts pacing]
LUKE: Because he's not good for her.
LORELAI: Luke...
LUKE: [adamantly] He's not. He's not right for her.
LORELAI: You're mad at Dean from years past. What's past is past. They're a couple now. Do you even remember why you're mad at him?
LUKE: He's a punk. That's what I remember. Just look at his history. He broke her heart before.
LORELAI: Their problems were mutual. You don't know the whole story.
LUKE: [emphatically] He got married and bailed out before the honeymoon was even over.
LORELAI: When you're young, you make mistakes.
LUKE: He was pining for Rory, and he got married. That's unstable.
LORELAI: He's 19. Give him a break.
LUKE: He doesn't know what he wants. He's proven that. How can Rory trust him now?
LORELAI: Matters of the heart are not science. There are no sure things.
LUKE: [stubbornly] He's not good enough for her.
LORELAI: Well, who is? Jess?
LUKE: No, not Jess. A prince, maybe. One that's in line to be king. Not one of those waiting-for-a-brother-to-die ones, but a real one. If not a prince, someone who's gonna be good for her. You know, Rory is like Pippi.
LORELAI: Pippi?
LUKE: She can have adventures and be free, she's smart. The whole world's waiting for her.
LORELAI: [disbelief] You're comparing Rory to Pippi Longstocking?
LUKE: [counting attributes on his fingers] Pippi is strong and independent. She can lift a horse above her head. Uh-huh. And b*at up bullies and build a hot-air balloon. She's unique, like Rory. But I guarantee you, if Pippi had met Dean, [Lorelai sighs] there would be no horse, no balloons. He'd drag her down to his level, spend all her gold coins, and poof, like that, all her dreams would be gone.
LORELAI: It's Rory's choice who she chooses to be with. Not yours, not mine.
LUKE: Does it feel right to you? Are you okay with this Rory-and-Dean thing?
LORELAI: [quietly] I just need this to work.
LUKE: Look at me. Not stopping till he's upset every person that means anything in the world to him in one night. [he pulls her into a long tight hug. After a long pause…] You want a beer?
[She answers without hesitation]
LORELAI: Yes. [ She sighs as they both sit on the sofa ] Maybe if I brought out the Twister.
LUKE: Maybe.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE HOME - SAME EVENING
[Emily is sitting at a small desk writing letters. Sound of the front door closing. ]
EMILY: Who is it?
[Richard enters]
RICHARD: I hope this isn't a bad time.
EMILY: No, I was just catching up on some correspondence.
RICHARD: I just wanted to let you know that our property tax bill is wrong this year. I'm contesting it. In case they call here, I wanted to let you know.
EMILY: Fine. Thank you.
RICHARD: You're welcome. [He takes a step as if to leave. After a pause Emily returns to her letters] Oh, and I've joined a barbershop quartet.
EMILY: Oh.
RICHARD: Yeah, we do it up right. Dress in period costumes. These silly vests and things. We've performed a couple of times at charity events.
EMILY: [small private smile] All right.
RICHARD: It's part of a barbershop chorus. That's a group of about 30.
EMILY: [smiles] Very good.
RICHARD: I guess I'll be going. [He turns to leave and spies the large metal structure in the foyer.]
EMILY: I bought a panic room.
RICHARD: [showing no reaction as he looks back] Very good. [He leaves]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREET - SAME EVENING
[Rory, drives her Toyota Prius through the street and spots Dean walking home. She slows to a stop and he approaches her open window]
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: Hi. [grins with good humor] Well, I guess that was a bust, huh?
RORY: Sorry. Maybe it was too soon.
DEAN: Well, your mom was real nice.
RORY: She was great.
DEAN: Thank her for me, okay?
RORY: I will. It was fun for a while there, though, wasn't it? [smiling while remembering]
DEAN: [grins comfortably] Yeah. The movie was. It was real fun.
RORY: [slightly wistful] Like the old days.
DEAN: Like the old days. [after a pause] I'd invite you over, but Kyle's entertaining some buddies.
RORY: I should go anyway. Want a ride?
DEAN: I'm almost there.
RORY: Okay. Kiss. [he leans in and they kiss sweetly] Bye.
DEAN: Bye.
[she watches him walk off, before putting car in gear and driving slowly off, deep in thought]

[Interior Lorelai's house: front door]
(Knock, knock)
(Lorelai answers.)
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey, you back. (They kiss.) Ready?
LORELAI: Almost.
LUKE: Almost?
LORELAI: I just have to find my keys, and finish the laundry…
LUKE: That doesn't sound like almost, that sounds like we're gonna have to speed to the movies, park illegally, you hit the bathroom while I grab the popcorn, we'll meet back at the seats all sweaty and aggravated –
LORELAI: Well of course I'll be aggravated, you forgot the Red Vines. No, no keys here. (Searching)
LUKE: You know the lights are on in your Jeep?
LORELAI: Oh yeah, the porch light's out and it was dark so I left the Jeep on for the light. Could you lift, please?
Luke (lifting couch while Lorelai looks under it): But the battery's going to die.
LORELAI: Oh, no, I timed it. It takes 12 hours for the battery to wear out. I go to work at eight o'clock, giving me two hours to spare and a whole day to recharge. Not here either. Down, please.
(Luke sets the couch down.)
LUKE: Why don't you just change the porch light?
LORELAI: Have you seen how dirty it is up there? With those creepy moths that fly in your face, and you could swallow one, and end up with some weird hand-to-mouth-to-moth disease –
LUKE: There's no such thing.
LORELAI: Oh, no? Did you see Mothman Prophecies?
LUKE: Yes.
LORELAI: Oh, well, okay then. Did you see the sequel?
LUKE: There's a sequel?
LORELAI: Yes. It is a heartbreaking saga in which Richard Gere gets a life threatening disease from changing a dirty porch light.
LUKE: There was no sequel.
LORELAI: Well, it's still really gross up there.
LUKE: How long has it been out?
LORELAI: Uh, since Rory broke up with Dean, the first time.
LUKE: Not the sequel.
LORELAI: Yes, he was the last one to change it. Jess never changed the porch light, by the way. Okay, this room is definitely keyless. Kitchen!
(Lorelai walks into kitchen and opens oven.)
LUKE: You left your keys in the stove?
LORELAI: No, my socks.
LUKE: Your socks, of course. How naïve of me.
LORELAI: It makes them warm and slightly toasty. (She puts them on.) Huh, that's weird.
LUKE: What's weird? There's so much to choose from.
LORELAI: They're still damp. I followed the recipe. Bake at two-fifty, ten minutes on one side, ten on the other, they should be done by now. Think my oven's broken?
LUKE: What about your dryer?
LORELAI: No, dryer's fine.
LUKE: I think we should get to the movies.
LORELAI: All done, let's go.
LUKE: Keys!
LORELAI: Ah, forget about them. I'll just leave the door unlocked.
LUKE: You can't leave the door unlocked. That's not safe.
LORELAI: Sure it is.
LUKE: Just because you say it's safe doesn't make it safe.
LORELAI: If you build it, they will come.
LUKE: Have you checked out the… Your keys are in the door!
LORELAI: Huh, they are? That's right, I had to go in the back way because the porch light was out!
LUKE: They're stuck.
LORELAI: Yeah, that happens. (She hangs a towel over the doorknob.) There. You ready?
LUKE: I can never pick you up here again.
[Opening credits.]
[Yale newspaper office]
PARIS: I had a dream about you last night.
RORY: If this gets dirty, feel free to keep it to yourself.
PARIS: I dreamed that in spite of the fact that you knew I wanted to be assigned the religion b*at, you went behind my back to Doyle, cooked him dinner and stole it from me.
RORY: It's just a dream, Paris.
PARIS: You made veal parmigiana, and it felt very real.
RORY: I don't make veal parmigiana. I don't make anything, and I don't want the religion b*at. I want features, you know that.
PARIS: You say you want features –
RORY: And I mean it.
PARIS: Dreams tell you things. It's our subconscious talking to us. Warning us, telling us about things that are happening.
RORY: Paris –
PARIS: My dream was telling me that you are stabbing me in the back with your veal parmigiana.
RORY: Well I must have really overcooked it then.
PARIS: Let me smell your hands.
RORY: Oh, go away!
PARIS: You used a lot of garlic.
RORY: Bye.
PARIS: Rory, listen to me. We're close, like, friends, and I would hate for something as trivial as competition for the religion b*at to come between us.
RORY: Oh, my God, I don't want the religion b*at!
PARIS: We could end up like the Van Burens.
RORY: As in Mr. and Mrs. President?
PARIS: As in Abby and Ann.
RORY: Right.
PARIS: Sisters in blood, but bitter rivals. They don't even speak anymore.
RORY: That's ‘cause one of them is dead.
PARIS: You don't want the religion b*at?
RORY: Oh! I'm sorry, you meant the religion b*at – No! I don't!
(A blonde girl walks by.)
PARIS: Tenora Thomas was in my dream too, she was pouring the wine – Yo! Tenora! Where's the fire? (She chases after her.)
DOYLE: Hey Rory, did you see this?
RORY: See what?
GLENN: It's no big deal.
DOYLE: Glenn here got himself published in the New York Times.
RORY: You're kidding!
GLENN: It's no big deal.
DOYLE: It's no big deal, he says.
RORY: Oh, but this is the article you wrote about the reprinting of The Anarchist's Cookbook.
GLENN: It's no big deal!
RORY: This was in our last issue.
DOYLE: The Times picked it up. They do that every now and then, they pick up something and they publish it, and that's what they did with our boy Glenn here.
GLENN: Please don't pat my back again.
RORY: Well, congratulations, Glenn.
GLENN: Don't say it loud, people are looking.
RORY: You should be proud!
GLENN: Why, it's not even my best piece.
RORY: It's still pretty amazing.
DOYLE: It is amazing. It's absolutely amazing that I spent all summer in Indiana working my ass off for the Muncie Messenger, and you went from Star Trek Convention to Boba Fett Fan Club Symposium, and yet, lookie here. The New York Times. Isn't that great, Rory? Aren't you seeing how great it is?
GLENN: Look! Get off my bus, okay? I don't know why they picked it, I didn't ask them to pick it, I don't even read the New York Times!
DOYLE: You don't read the New –
RORY: Well Glenn, it's great, and we're all just really happy for you. (She runs back to her desk.)
GLENN: Whatever. (His cell phone rings, Glenn sighs.) Oh man, it's R.W. Apple again. God, does he have anyone else to talk to? (Answers phone while exiting) What?
DOYLE: It's like Being There. And he's Chauncey Gardiner.
RORY: Hey, Doyle, you have to look at it this way. You edited that piece, and if it hadn't been edited well, the Times never would have picked it.
DOYLE: Oh. That's a great way to look at it. Thank you! You know, it's because of me that he's going to be Bob Woodward. I made it happen. So, some day when I'm running the circulation desk at the Muncie Messenger and Glenn is accepting his Pulitzer Prize, I can point up at the screen at the local bar where I regularly stop on my way home to get drop dead drunk, and say, "I helped him get there." Then I can fall off my stool and throw up. Thank you so much for that, Gilmore. I never would've thought to look at it that way if it hadn't have been for you!
(Doyle storms off; Rory sighs and pick up Glenn's copy of the New York Times.)
[Rory's dorm room]
(Rory flops onto her bed, sighs and looks again at the article in the New York Times. Her cell phone rings.)
RORY: Hey Mom.
[Scene cuts between Rory's dorm and Lorelai's kitchen. Lorelai sits at the table while Luke has his head in the oven.]
LORELAI: So, how are you? Do you wanna laugh?
RORY: Oh, laughing would be good.
LORELAI: Luke did the funniest bit before, I thought you would so be –
LUKE: Would you stop? I did not do a bit.
LORELAI: What are you talking about? The bit! It was a riot.
LUKE: It wasn't a bit! I banged my head on the stove and it hurt like hell.
LORELAI: No… no, you said it funnier before. Do it again!
LUKE: I told you, I never did it in the first place. You did it, it's your bit.
LORELAI: How could it be my bit when it's your head in the oven?
LUKE: Exactly. My head, my conk, no bit.
RORY: Mom, just wondering, did you call for any particular reason?
LORELAI: Just checking in, seeing how you're doing. How are you doing?
RORY: I'm fine.
LORELAI: Aw, what's wrong?
RORY: What makes you think something's wrong?
LORELAI: You've got Bambi voice.
RORY: I do not have Bambi voice.
LORELAI: Spill, please.
RORY: I'm just… really behind.
LORELAI: Behind what?
RORY: I'm behind at the paper. Way, way behind at the paper. Everyone else had these amazing, productive summers. Internships at hometown papers, getting articles reprinted in the New York Times, and me, the person who's been talking about being a journalist her entire life, what did I do? I wasted two whole months running away to Europe with Grandma.
LORELAI: Whoa, slow down. First of all, Europe – waste? You had major invaluable experiences, the architecture, the food, seeing my mother without her makeup on in the morning.
RORY: But this is the time for work, for learning. I didn't even consider and internship anywhere, I was so wrapped up in my own personal… whatever. I can't believe I did this.
LORELAI: Well, okay, let's take a step back here. You say you're behind –
RORY: I am behind.
LORELAI: - so, you'll catch up.
RORY: You say that like it's easy.
LORELAI: No, I say that like it's what you're going to do. You've done it before. You were behind at Chilton – you remember? And then you hit a deer, and everything was fine.
RORY: The two incidents were in no way connected.
LORELAI: But you caught up, right?
RORY: That was high school. This is college, a very big, important college.
LORELAI: Okay, different school, but same Rory. You're great at the catch up thing, you're the "catch up girl" – not to be confused with "ketchup girl", ‘cause that's not you at all. You were strictly a mustard and relish girl from day one – there's a little condiment humor for ya.
RORY: I'm really going to have to work – constantly. Maybe I'll have to look for something part-time at a local paper.
LORELAI: Good, that's good… Or you could work for a fishmonger.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: ‘Cause there's lots of newspapers there.
LUKE: - Ow! Geez! What the – Doh!
Lorelai (laughing): He did it! He did the bit! Luke, do it again. Do it louder for Rory.
RORY: Hey, Mom?
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: You sound happy.
LORELAI: I am, kid. (She smiles at Luke.)
LUKE: What?
[Dragonfly Inn: dining room]
STEPHEN: Mr. Mailer, it's just such a great honor to be doing this interview, so I just want to thank you.
NORMAN MAILER: Can I give you a tip?
STEPHEN: Yes, sir.
NORMAN MAILER: I wouldn't start that way for a simple reason – I don't trust compliments. I've been getting them for years. Sometimes I deserve them, sometimes I didn't. But generally when people give you compliments there's one of two things wrong with them. Either they're false, or what's worse is they're sincere. They really mean the compliment. And then they're offering you their loyalty. And I'm kind of a stingy… Well, I don't necessarily want to give all that loyalty back. So either way, let's skip the compliments.
STEPHEN: Let's talk about, uh, what are you working on now?
NORMAN MAILER: I'm gonna say no to you, I can't tell you what I'm working on. A novel is like a secret affair, you don't bring other people in on it.
[Dragonfly Inn: kitchen]
LORELAI: Norman Mailer's back, for the third time this week!
SOOKIE: Yep, sure is.
LORELAI: This is so exciting. I've got to call and tell Rory. You know, she read The Naked and the Dead while she was still wearing footsie pajamas.
SOOKIE: (yells) Chicken's burning!
LORELAI: This is our first step on the road to being Solon. I mean, as soon as word gets out that Norman Mailer is having lunch at the Dragonfly, it's just a matter of time before the rest of the literati comes sweeping in.
SOOKIE: Sounds great.
LORELAI: So, of course, we'll have to keep Gore Vidal on the other side of the room, but, you know, probably Gabriel Garcia Marquez will run interference for us –
Sookie (irritably, to staff): Butter bath, boys, butter bath!
LORELAI: Are you okay?
SOOKIE: Sure. And I'm thrilled and delighted that Norman Mailer is coming in here every day and sitting at a table for four and ordering nothing at all, but tea!
LORELAI: Tea?
SOOKIE: Iced tea. Glass after glass after glass!
LORELAI: I'm sure he orders more than iced tea.
SOOKIE: Are you, now?
LORELAI: All right, you make great iced tea. I mean, legendary, so can you blame him?
SOOKIE: All I know is when Billy Joel came in to the Independence Inn he would pack it away. Appetizers! Main course! Two, three desserts! That was a man that knew how to eat! And he was almost able to hide it.
LORELAI: Yes, but have you ever read his novels?
SOOKIE: This is a restaurant, not a coffee shop.
LORELAI: Come on, Sookie, this is fun! We're the cool place where Norman Mailer likes to hang. It'll give us street cred, you'll see.
SOOKIE: Fine. Waiter: We need some more iced tea.
SOOKIE: Gee, I wonder who that's for?
[Yale newspaper office]
DOYLE: Lena, economic development. Seng, Woodbridge Hall. Benji, legal issues. Paris, religion b*at.
PARIS: Me? Really? Huh, I hadn't thought. All right.
DOYLE: Jerry, city arts; Rory, features; Glenn, crime. (Glen clears his throat.)
DOYLE: What, Glenn, you don't want crime?
GLENN: I don't care. Maureen Dowd told me it's all the same, not that that flirt has any idea what she's talking about.
DOYLE: All right, that's it. Congratulations if you got what you wanted, and if you didn't, I could care less. Get cracking. (Meeting breaks up.)
RORY: Thank you so much for features b*at. I can't tell you how excited I am.
DOYLE: And please don't try.
RORY: No, I'm gonna kick butt. You just wait and see.
DOYLE: You're a reporter now, Gilmore. You've gotta learn to say ass.
RORY: I'll work on that. Hey, listen, um, I have about a million ideas for my first story, so I was wondering if I could run some of them by you, see what you think?
DOYLE: Two minutes. Go.
RORY: Okay, well, first I thought I could do an update on unionizing the janitorial staff, you know, a classic power struggle; haves versus the have-nots.
DOYLE: Okay.
RORY: Or – and I already have the headline for this one – "Yale's Liberal Activist Network: A thing of the past?"
DOYLE: Catchy, catchy
RORY: Then there's the issue of illegal music downloading on campus, which I imagine is a major – (Logan walks in with his crew.)
DOYLE: Oh no.
RORY: What?
DOYLE: He's back.
LOGAN: Doyle, my friend. (They shake hands.) You're looking very, very well, how ya been?
DOYLE: I've been great, Logan. Great to have you back.
LOGAN: Yeah, well, I stayed away as long as I could, but the Yale Daily News called to me.
DOYLE: Oh, sure. So how's everything? How's the family?
LOGAN: Everything's fine, the family's the family… Ah, my desk. Beautiful.
DOYLE: Um, you know, Logan, I didn't know exactly when you were coming back, and I gave out the b*at.
LOGAN: That's fine, Doyle, I'll take whatever you've got left. (He sits with his feet up on the desk.)
DOYLE: Actually, there's none left.
LOGAN: Perfect, just the one I wanted. Relax, Doyle. I'm just here for the pretty picture in my father's head. I'm not going to be any trouble at all.
DOYLE: Oh, Logan, please. You, trouble? Stop. We're just glad to have you here.
LOGAN: Careful, boy, you might hurt yourself, kid. Better get back to work, right boss? Rory, nice to see you. (Doyle crosses over to Rory's desk.)
DOYLE: You know Logan? How do you know Logan?
RORY: No, I don't know him, I met him. A friend introduced us.
DOYLE: So you're not friends.
RORY: No, definitely not friends.
Doyle (hushed): That guy's a real piece of work. He took last year off with a bunch of his friends. He was going to sail Daddy's yacht around till he sank it.
RORY: He sank his father's yacht?
DOYLE: Right off of Fiji. They spent six months of gallivanting and partying and God knows what in there till Daddy sent one of his planes to bring him back.
RORY: I'm guessing his father's rich.
DOYLE: His father's Mitchum Huntzberger.
RORY: Mitchum Huntzberger? The newspaper guy?
DOYLE: The newspaper magnet. The man owns at least twelve different papers. I've spent two years kissing Logan's butt.
RORY: Don't you mean ass?
DOYLE: Whatever. Guess it's time to pucker up again. Man, I hate those kind of guys.
RORY: What kind of guys?
DOYLE: Those privileged, white males.
RORY: Doyle, you're a privileged white male.
DOYLE: Well, he's more privileged. And way more whiter. Why am I talking to you? Meg, why am I talking to Gilmore?
RORY: My story – we were picking a story.
DOYLE: Right. Well, they all sound fine to me.
RORY: Then I think I'll go with the downloading story.
DOYLE: Good. Go with your gut. And get to work. (He turns to leave. Logan puts on an old "press" hat.)
LOGAN: (1920's reporter voice, on the phone.) Hello, city desk? Smitty here, take this down. I got a hot scoop on a tall blonde and I gotta put it to bed on the double! (He hangs up, laughs at Doyle, winks at Rory, then puts his feet back on the desk and leans back for a nap with the hat over his face.)
[Dragonfly Inn: dining room]
STEPHEN: How do you see your position in American letters?
NORMAN MAILER: I'm either the best, or I'm not. And I have no idea. And in fact I don't even worry about it anymore, because it doesn't matter whether you think you're the best, there are twenty of us around. Twenty American writers right now – I could name them but I won't – who think they're the best living American writer. And I'm one of those twenty. (Sookie enters dining room.) On the other hand, I don't want to make friends with some of those guys, because they're bastards.
STEPHEN: Okay, so who is your favorite author of all time?
Sookie (interrupting): So, how are we doing over here?
NORMAN MAILER (irritated): We're fine.
SOOKIE: Hey, you know what goes great with iced tea? Pork tenderloin!
STEPHEN: Maybe later, thanks. Sookie; We have a great menu here. I'm holding a couple as we speak.
NORMAN MAILER: We're fine, thank you.
SOOKIE: Okay. Hey, I don't know if the waiter told you, but today is Wednesday. And on Wednesday at the Dragonfly we play a little something I like to call "Stump the chef"! Which is me. And the way we play is that you name any dish in the world and I will make it for you, and if I don't know what it is, then you get your lunch completely free!
NORMAN MAILER: What the devil is she talking about?
STEPHEN: Actually, you know what, could we have some lemon for the iced tea?
SOOKIE: Lemon? ... oh, sure. One plate of lemon coming up. (She turns to leave) If you change your mind, I'll be in the kitchen. You know, with the food.
[Rory's Dorm Room: common room]
Rory (on the phone): I already have a ton of data and pages of research and, ooh, the best thing is, Nancy, this girl on the fourth floor, her father was the guy who ran security at the gallery when Lars Ulrich sold all his art and he said he would try to get him on the phone for an interview and I've gotta breathe now.
[Scene cuts from Rory to Dean, who is at the register at Doose's Market in a cowboy hat.]
Dean: I think that was a record.
RORY: So what do you think? You think it sounds big enough, important enough? Dean: Yes, I do.
RORY: I think so too. I feel very, very good about this, Forester. Dean: Excellent to hear, Gilmore. (Paris enters dorm, also talking on the phone.)
PARIS: Monsignor, why is my asking you keep your cell on vibrate during mass in case I need to fact check a quote outrageous? Rabbi Feldman's doing it for me on Shabbat and he's flying against the Talmud there. (Into her bedroom) Dean: So, when do I get to read this story of yours?
RORY: Well, I figured I'll finish a rough draft in time for our date tomorrow night. So you can have a romantic night of proofreading. Huh? Pretty hot, don't ya think? Dean: Yeah, listen -
RORY: I'm kidding; you don't have to read it. I'll read it to you. Dean: I have to work tomorrow night.
RORY: What? Dean: Sorry.
RORY: But it's Thursday. Since when do you work on Thursday? Dean: Since Taylor decided to cash in on the 24-hour trucker crowd.
RORY: What trucker crowd? Dean: The trucker crowd off Highway 84.
RORY: Since when does the trucker crowd off Highway 84 come through Star's Hollow? Dean: Since we installed an icy machine.
RORY: Wow. Dean: Yep. I'm stuck here pulling the new shifts until we see how it's catching on.
RORY: Sounds rough. Dean: Yeah. You haven't lived until you've heard Taylor belt out "Stand by Your Man".
RORY: You deserve hazard pay. Dean: I've already submitted for it.
RORY: So, no tomorrow night. Bummer. How about Saturday? Dean: Saturday I'm here. Uh, what about next week? I've got Tuesday and Wednesdays off.
RORY: I have this article, and I'm already behind on my reading. Next weekend? Dean: Going to Maine for my grandparent's wedding anniversary.
RORY: Well, it was nice knowing ya. Dean: Way to stand by your man.
RORY: So I guess that's week after next, huh? Dean: Yeah, I guess so.
RORY: I turn in my article on that Monday. Dean: Monday night it is.
RORY: They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. Dean: Yeah. Sex can do that also.
RORY: Amen, brother. Dean: Okay, I've got to go. You have to stir the nacho cheese every twenty minutes or it forms kind of a rock.
RORY: Go stir the cheese. Dean: Call you tomorrow.
RORY: Okay. Bye. (Paris comes back into the common room.)
PARIS: Did you know that priests have a fabulous sense of humor?
RORY: Just stay one lightning bolt's length away from me at all times please.
PARIS: You want to go check out some Mormon bingo around 5th?
RORY: No thanks.
PARIS: How's your article coming?
RORY: Very good.
PARIS: Good. So you must have found a new angle on it. Right?
RORY: Right. New angle.
PARIS: Yeah. Downloading stories are everywhere and they all say exactly the same thing. Downloading's up, CD sales are down, but up from last year. It's not hurting the music industry but the music industry's hurting. Blah, blah, blah. You know. It always seems like there's got to be more to it than that, but there never is. But, you have a fresh angle. So good.
RORY: Yeah. Good.
PARIS: Okay. I'll be back late. If Rabbi Feldman calls, tell him I got the stats from Edward James Olmos' office, so I'm good. Bye.
RORY: Yeah, bye.
[Dragonfly Inn: office]
ANN: What's this? Never mind, I see the noted pink, thank you Lorelai.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
ANN: Okay. I see a lot of growth this month. The initial drop off, which we all knew was going to happen after the opening has sort of settled and you're doing a good seventy to seventy-five percent occupancy, which is pretty good.
LORELAI: Yeah, and the holidays are coming up, we're booked solid the last three weeks of November.
ANN: Well that's all positive news. So let's just talk about the couple of things we can do to help till then.
LORELAI: So, we need help?
ANN: Well, yeah. Some. It's the first year, and you're going to building the business so there's not a lot of profit right now, and personally I'd feel better if we could just lighten some of the financial load.
SOOKIE: Financial load.
LORELAI: That sounds bad. Michel: I could put in for overtime and I don't.
ANN: Look, you need to get some of these burdens off you. For example, lunch.
SOOKIE: What about lunch?
ANN: Well, breakfast seems to be breaking even, and you're doing fine with dinner but, lunch?
SOOKIE: What about lunch, Ann?
ANN: You're hemorrhaging money at lunch. You have a full staff for a basically empty dining room. I think it might be a good idea to drop lunch until you get your occupancy rate up higher and –
SOOKIE: Drop lunch, did she say drop lunch?
LORELAI: Just until we get our occupancy rates up a little higher.
ANN: A lot higher.
SOOKIE: I don't understand. That's the only thing we can do?
ANN: Well –
SOOKIE: I mean, I just think it's extremely coincidental that the only thing we can do to save the inn is to get rid of lunch.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sure it's not the only thing.
SOOKIE: I mean, lunch is my thing. Why do we have to get rid of one of my things? Why can't we get rid of one of Michel's things? Michel: What things? I stand behind a desk and answer a phone. What of mine can you possibly get rid of?
SOOKIE: The desk! Put the phone on the wall! Michel: What?
SOOKIE: And write on your shoe, because he goes through a lot of paper.
LORELAI: Okay! Ann, would you just, uh…
SOOKIE: It's not fair! It's not fair that everybody else gets to keep their thing and I have to get rid of my lunch.
LORELAI: Sookie, Ann's just trying to help.
SOOKIE: Oh, Ann hates me.
ANN: No, I don't!
LORELAI: Okay, Ann, how would you like to go in the kitchen and get yourself a cup of coffee?
ANN: I don't hate her.
LORELAI: I know. Michel can you get Ann some coffee? Michel: Oh, absolutely. And then I'll go hang my phone on the wall. (He gets up to escort Ann to the kitchen.) Oh, I have to tell you, looking good is so important when you represent the face of the company. I mean, I am the first thing that a customer sees when they walk through that door.
ANN: Your suits are not a deduction, Michel. (They leave.)
LORELAI: What are you doing?
SOOKIE: She's taking my lunches away.
LORELAI: She's trying to help us.
SOOKIE: This is all Norman Mailer's fault. He just sits around, ordering nothing and yammering on and on and on. I mean, so he was married to Marilyn Munroe. Who wasn't?
LORELAI: That was Arthur Miller.
SOOKIE: I'm going to kick him and pinch his nose.
LORELAI: Hey, get a grip. Sookie, we're trying to launch a business here.
SOOKIE: The restaurant is part of the business.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: And cutting out lunch is not the…
LORELAI: Temporarily cutting out lunch. Temporarily. Just until things perk up, which they will, and when they do, the lunches will go back, just like before. Sookie? Okay?
SOOKIE: Fine. (Gets up to leave.)
LORELAI: Just give it time.
SOOKIE: Mmhmm.
LORELAI: And we're going to leave Mr. Mailer alone, right? ‘Cause I don't care how old he is, he can take you.
SOOKIE: I know. (She goes.)



[Yale dorms: an unfamiliar common room.]
LEN: So, we're booted up, and we're searching the network for other clients, right? And then you enter the album you want in this search field, right? Let's say, it's the new Interpol, you heard it?
RORY: I think so.
LEN: A little less joy divisioning this time, more Nick Cave got mugged by Paul Whiler with some Seventeen Seconds Eric Cura thrown in. But anyway, for better quality you choose the file with the highest bit rate. It's a trade off ‘cause it's a bigger file size. The lower the bit rate, the smaller the file, but lower quality. Got that?
RORY: Higher smaller, lower larger.
LEN: Higher larger, lower smaller. Ooh, check this out. I can download a band's entire catalog with the push of a button. I'm gonna take down all twenty-two Chicago albums, boo-ya! There's Chicago One, Chicago Two, Chicago Three, Chicago Four… neat, huh?
RORY: Yeah. Really neat. Len: Chicago nine, Chicago ten… I hate Chicago. Use a trombone, go to jail. But, my goal is to get it all, from Abba to Zappa. There's the Christmas album.
RORY: Um. Okay, that's really fascinating stuff, but let me ask you, do you still buy CD's?
LEN: Yeah.
RORY: Mmhm. Anything to add to that?
LEN: CD sales are up this year, you hear about that?
RORY: Yes I did.
LEN: Down last year, up this year. Weird. Oh cool. Here's a 1986 bootleg of Chicago Live at the Cumberland Civic Center at Portland and Maine, boo-ya!
RORY: So, Len, tell me about when… er, ah… if…
LEN: Yeah?
RORY: Oh, I just, I lost my train of thought.
LEN: I hate that.
RORY: You know what, I think I'm going go get a cup of coffee. Coffee sounds good. I'll be back in a minute.
LEN: I'll be here. (She leaves)
[Yale dorms: Ladies washroom]
(Rory splashes some water on her face and stands in the corner. A drunk girl wearing a ball gown and a plastic gorilla mask enters the washroom. She doesn't see Rory. She touches up her lipstick. She notices Rory.) Gorilla Girl: Oops! Didn't see you there. (Giggles) Shhh. (She leaves. Rory follows her.)
[Yale dorms: Outside]
(Gorilla Girl opens the door to a black SUV, Rory watches from the door) Gorilla Girl: In Omnia Paratus! (She jumps in, giggling. They drive away)

(Lorelai walks out of the store wearing a cowboy hat and carrying a huge plate of nachos and an Icy. Her phone rings.)
LORELAI: Oh boy. Okay, hold on. I get it, you're ringing. Howdy ma'am. (To a woman passing by as she sets down her food.) Hold on, hold on, hold on. (She answers.) Yes, hi, hello.
CHRIS: Lor!
LORELAI: Chris?
CHRIS: I can't get her to stop.
LORELAI: Stop what?
CHRIS: Crying, screaming. She's not hot, there's no fever, and I can't get her to eat.
LORELAI: We're talking about Gigi, right?
CHRIS: Yes!
LORELAI: Okay, ‘cause, you know, Sherry's really thin, so I - (Gigi screams.)
LORELAI: Are you sure she's not hot?
CHRIS: No, I already checked. I don't know what to do. She's everywhere. She won't sit still, she keeps climbing out of her crib, she's moving really fast…
LORELAI: Oh, Chris, honey, calm down. Where's Sherry?
CHRIS: She's not here, she's out again.
LORELAI: When is she getting home?
CHRIS: I don't know what to do. I didn't know who to call, the nanny is not answering her pager, and Sherry's friends, they don't have kids or like kids, I just…
LORELAI: I'll be right there. Ah, bye. (She hangs up and rushes off.)
[Chris and Sherry's apartment]
(Chris answers the door)
CHRIS: I owe you so big.
LORELAI: Wow, you look, uh, great. (Looks around) Huh. How long ago did Axl Rose leave?
CHRIS: Yeah, the, uh, place is kind of a mess, I tried to clean up earlier but she keeps climbing out of the crib, if she's not climbing, she's screaming… I really don't know what to do here. I mean, I keep thinking she's hungry but she won't eat, and – (Gigi cries.) Oh, crap. There she goes again. C'mon, Gig, let's go back in the crib, huh? (Gigi screams again.)
LORELAI: You tell him, girlfriend.
CHRIS: She hasn't slept. She hasn't slept for days.
LORELAI: I'm guessing that makes two of you.
CHRIS: Yeah, well… C'mon, Gig, just a little sleep, huh?
LORELAI: Um, Chris, where is Sherry?
CHRIS: She's, uh, away. Oh, c'mon, seriously Gigi. Five hundred bucks if you stay in there for ten minutes.
LORELAI: Hold out, kid, you've got him on the ropes now.
CHRIS: She doesn't need your help.
LORELAI: No, she doesn't. Just… come here. (She picks op Gigi) Hi! Oh, wow! I hear strained spinach is the new pink! (Hands her to Chris)
CHRIS: It's okay… (Lorelai turns the crib toward the wall.)
LORELAI: There you go.
CHRIS: That's it?
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRIS: You mean, she's going to stay in there?
LORELAI: Yeah, until her hair grows long enough for the prince to shimmy up. (Puts Gigi back in the crib.) Come on. (They sit on the couch.)
CHRIS: Oh, God, I am so sorry, Lor.
LORELAI: Oh, for what?
CHRIS: Well, I hardly ever call you, or Rory, but the minute I'm in trouble…
LORELAI: Well, that's what we're here for.
CHRIS: Yeah. Well, I've been traveling so much, and then I get home to this, and I didn't know what to do. I swear, I didn't know what to do.
LORELAI: Chris.
CHRIS: Yeah?
LORELAI: Where is Sherry?
CHRIS: Sherry is in Paris.
LORELAI: Wow, lucky girl. When does she get back?
CHRIS: She's not.
LORELAI: She's…
CHRIS: I got home from Seattle, and the nanny was here and she handed me a note. It said that Sherry had been offered a job in Paris and she had decided to take it.
LORELAI: What?
CHRIS: She said she had put her career on hold for almost two years. She said that I had been gone for most of that time, which, I guess is true, and she wasn't going to let this opportunity pass. She said it was my turn, she was sorry, but that she had to do this – for her.
LORELAI: Wow.
CHRIS: Yeah.
LORELAI: I'm stunned.
CHRIS: Pretty much my same reaction.
LORELAI: But Gigi – she just takes off on Gigi?... Okay, well. You smell as good as you look.
CHRIS: I haven't showered since Seattle.
LORELAI: Really, well, I'm hot. Okay, um, how about this for a plan. You – go take a shower. And I will, um, order some food and start to clean up and then we'll –
CHRIS: Hey, I can't do this.
LORELAI: Do what? Shower? Oh, you've done it before. Just turn the water on, step in. Oh, no wait, remove clothes, then step in.
CHRIS: I can't raise her. I cannot raise her all by myself.
LORELAI: Yes you can.
CHRIS: What makes you think so?
LORELAI: Because you have to, Chris. She's your daughter, and you're going to find a way. I did. I did it with Rory.
CHRIS: Oh, you're different.
LORELAI: Yes, I was sixteen.
CHRIS: No, you're different, I mean, you're special. You're stronger. You're like a superhero with red boots and a golden lasso.
LORELAI: That was one Halloween, Christopher.
CHRIS: I mean, you raised Rory all by yourself, you had no one to help you and you didn't look back.
LORELAI: That's right. But if I had decided to bail on Rory and follow the Bangles around the world, which is what I planned to do when the Demerol kicked in, then you would've put on the red boots and golden lasso and you would have raised her and everything would have been fine. Except she wouldn't have introduced you to anyone, or let you go to the parent night at school ‘cause you looked so freaky.
CHRIS: I don't know.
LORELAI: She is your daughter.
CHRIS: And I don't even know her. I've been gone so much.
LORELAI: Well, welcome home, babe.
CHRIS: I don't want to screw this up, Lor.
LORELAI: You're not going to. I know you can do this, Chris.
CHRIS: You ever get tired of being my cheerleader?
LORELAI: Hey, as long as I look cute in the skirt I'm good to go.
CHRIS: Okay. Uh, I really need to shower.
LORELAI: Yeah. I'll clear a path, and order some food?
CHRIS: Yeah. No applesauce.
LORELAI: You got it.
CHRIS: So, you really think I can handle this?
LORELAI: No doubt in my mind. (Gigi cries.) Go. I've got the crying.
CHRIS: Hey, Lor?
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRIS: I don't know what I do without you.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, you're going to find out real soon if you don't –
CHRIS: Take off clothes, get in shower, turn on water. I'm going.
Lorelai (singing to Gigi): Just another manic Monday…

DOYLE: Gellar! Do you see what I have here in my hand?
PARIS: I'm busy, Doyle.
DOYLE: Rabbi Baron says he's changed his number twice.
PARIS: Oh, please.
DOYLE: Father Callahan is threatening a restraining order.
PARIS: If I had a nickel…
DOYLE: And the honorable Muhammed Abdul Aziz says that you stole his flip-flops.
PARIS: What a lie. He leaves them out in his hallway and I have told him a million times that people suck, and –
DOYLE: Paris!
PARIS: What?
DOYLE: You have threatened, stalked and basically freaked out every religious leader within a hundred mile radius. This paper has never received so many complaints in the history of its existence. And how the hell did you get Jesse Jackson's barber's number? How?
PARIS: Hey, you gave me this b*at to find the story, not to cow-tow and make nice, and –
DOYLE: Gellar!
PARIS: What!
DOYLE: Way to go.
PARIS: Thanks.
DOYLE: Don't you dare give back those flip-flops.
PARIS: Not a chance, they fit perfectly. (Doyle walks away.)
RORY: Hey, Doyle, I think I want to change my story.
DOYLE: Yeah?
RORY: Yeah. The downloading story was a dead end, there's nothing there.
DOYLE: You're telling me.
RORY: What?
DOYLE: I got bored just hearing you pitch it. So what do you got now?
RORY: Okay. Well, last night I was in one of the bathrooms over at Berkeley, and this girl came in, slightly toasted, and she was wearing a full on ball gown with one of those plastic gorilla masks.
DOYLE: Huh. Not something you see every day.
RORY: Exactly what I thought. So I followed her out to the parking lot, and she got in this fancy black SUV, and said "In Omnia Paratus", which means "Ready for anything". I know, I took Latin.
DOYLE: Quel impressed. Continue
RORY: All this seemed a little weird, but interesting weird, you know? So, I don't know. Maybe it's all this hanging out with a real newspaper man like yourself, but my antennae went up. I felt there was a story there. Did you catch the subtle sucking up?
DOYLE: Caught it. Continue.
RORY: So, I googled the phrase, not quite sure what I was looking for, but then I found this. See, it links the phrase with a club here at Yale. It's sort of a secret society kind of Skull and Bones kind of creepy group dating back to the 1800's. This phrase was their motto. Now, that alone, not that interesting. But here. Look. (Shows him a picture of people jumping off a bridge holding umbrellas, with the phrase In Omnia Paratus scrawled across the bottom.)
DOYLE: (interested) Huh.
RORY: I found this in a 1996 edition of the Yale Daily News. It's an article on whether or not this club actually exists.
DOYLE: "The Life and Death Brigade." Yeah, I know these guys.
RORY: Oh, you do?
DOYLE: Well, I've heard of them. They're apparently even more elusive than the Skull and Bones crowd. ‘Course they've never been linked to masturbating in a coffin so I automatically like these guys better.
RORY: Hm. Well, what do you know about them?
DOYLE: Not much. Paper's tried to track them down before, and we've gotten a few leads, but no one's ever gotten close enough to confirm anything. We all know they exist, but, we don't know they exist. It's all just too-too. God I hate those stupid clubs.
RORY: I want to do this story. I want to find this club, track them down, get on the inside. What do you think?
DOYLE: Go with your gut.
RORY: You said that about my downloading story. Hey, you don't trust my gut!
[Elder Gilmore's house: outside.]
(Lorelai is waiting by her Jeep for Rory to arrive.)
LORELAI: Finally.
RORY: What are you doing out here?
LORELAI: Am I wearing the same thing I wore last Friday night?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Halfway here I was struck by the overwhelming feeling that I wore this exact outfit to last Friday night, and there's no way I'm going in there to see my mother wearing the same thing I wore last Friday night because I may not remember but she sure as hell will.
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: You don't know?
RORY: You don't remember but you expect me to?
LORELAI: Well, you look at me more than I look at me; you sit across from me at dinner. You had more of a chance to imprint my ensemble in your brain.
RORY: Sorry, no imprint.
LORELAI: Oh, that hurts.
RORY: Oh, I'm sure you don't remember what I was wearing.
LORELAI: I most certainly do.
RORY: Okay, what was I wearing?
LORELAI: You were wearing a lovely and delicately understated, uh, outfit… well, you were definitely wearing these arms.
RORY: Oh, way to imprint, lady.
LORELAI: Stand I front of me, just in case. (Rings doorbell.)
MAID: Hello.
LORELAI: Hi, we should be on the guest list. Holstein and Liza are expecting us. (Maid looks confused.)
LORELAI: Okay. Let's try it straight. Hi, we're here for dinner. I'm Lorelai the daughter, this is Rory the granddaughter.
MAID: Oh! Okay, I'm sorry. Right this way. (They walk in.)
[Elder Gilmore's house: inside]
RORY: She's acting weird.
LORELAI: She knows I'm wearing the same outfit as last week.
RORY: She wasn't here last week.
LORELAI: The world's small, maids talk.
RORY: About you?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: Oh. With all that's going on in the world, all the maids in existence are talking about you.
LORELAI: Huh. ‘Kay, now you're making me seem a little stuck up.
MAID: Can I get you something to drink?
LORELAI: Yes, a martini please.
RORY: Coke, please.
LORELAI: Oh, you know, maybe we should wait for my mother. Is she coming down soon?
MAID: No.
LORELAI: Oh. Okay. Do you know if she saw what I was wearing through the window?
MAID: Mrs. Gilmore isn't here.
LORELAI: She's not?
RORY: Where is she?
MAID: She's at a dinner for the Children's Hospital.
LORELAI: Oh! So she's not going to be here at all tonight.
MAID: No, I'm afraid not.
RORY: Okay. Well then I guess we can just…
LORELAI: You know, we'll just... go have dinner in the pool house with Dad.
MAID: Oh.
LORELAI: Oh?
MAID: Mr. Gilmore is out of town.
LORELAI: He is?
MAID: ‘Till Tuesday.
LORELAI: Aha. We've officially become afterthoughts.
MAID: Would you like me to make you two something for dinner?
RORY: Um, well, since everyone's gone, maybe I'll just head back to school. I have a lot of work to do at the paper.
LORELAI: Yeah. Okay. That would be one option, going back to school. However, another option would be staying here, ordering pizza, and eating dinner on the living room floor on paper plates.
RORY: You're evil!
LORELAI: Would you bring us a phone book, please?
MAID: Right away.
LORELAI: Get crazy!
RORY: Okay! (They take off their shoes.)
LORELAI: We have to really live it up. Carpe Diem, baby.
RORY: I'm touching the rug with my feet!
LORELAI: Ooh, you're perverse!
RORY: Hey, and when she brings the drinks, let's not use coasters!
LORELAI: Hey, I wonder if there's anything in here that we could un-alphabetize.
RORY: [gasps] The rug is so soft! Oh, you would not believe!
LORELAI: Gluing everything in this room to the ceiling so that it's in exactly the same place, but upside down, be going too far?
RORY: A little.
LORELAI: So, dish?
RORY: Absolutely.
LORELAI: Sherry left your dad.
RORY: What? When?
LORELAI: A couple of days ago. She got a job offer in Paris and she packed her tiny pants in a bag and bailed.
RORY: What about Gigi?
LORELAI: Left her with Chris.
RORY: No way.
LORELAI: Yeah. He came home, and the nanny handed him a letter.
RORY: I can't believe this! How could she just leave like that?
LORELAI: I have no idea.
RORY: How do you know all this?
LORELAI: He called me.
RORY: When?
LORELAI: Yesterday. He was freaking out because he couldn't stop Gigi from crawling out of her crib, and you know, I do have to hand it to him, he gets extra points for the very original duct taping of the diaper move. That place was a wreck.
RORY: You went over there?
LORELAI: Oh yeah. But I calmed him down, and, you know, we sort of got the place in order and I think everything's going to be okay. I'm going to go back on Monday and just make sure that everyone's still breathing.
RORY: Oh. Well, that's very nice of you.
LORELAI: Well, your dad is going to need a little help being… a dad. ‘Cause, I mean… well he was your dad, so…no newsflash here. But you should see Gigi. She's huge, and gorgeous, and a belcher. (Laughs, Rory looks worried. Maid returns with a phone book.) Oh, great! Dinner is served.
[Yale newspaper office]
(Late at night. Rory is alone. She finds an article in an old newspaper; headline: ‘Police Nab Members of "Secret Society" ‘. She looks closer at the caption and reads the name ‘Elias Huntzberger'. She copies the name onto a Post-It note.)
[Dragonfly Inn: Reception desk.]
(Lorelai is displaying a brochure to a couple.)
LORELAI: It's a beautiful one and a half mile hike, there's a waterfall around this bend here, and over here are some of the oldest birch trees in the area, a rare butterfly nature preserve is off to the right here – (her phone rings) Oh, excuse me. Michel, would you take over?
Michel: Oh, yes. Of course. (She leaves.) Okay, so over here, by this semi-polluted brook, you will find large scary spiders and a fascinating display of poison ivy.
[Dragonfly Inn: bottom of the staircase.]
LORELAI: Luke, slow down! … I can't come now, I'm working. He what? …Okay, fine. I'm on my way. Yes, I'm running. My feet are going like a cartoon character, there are dust clouds behind me and the background keeps repeating itself. Bye! (Hangs up.)
[Reception desk]
Michel: …which brings you to the rattlesnake curve, where people have actually died painful but very picturesque deaths.
[Luke's Diner: Outside.]
(Kirk is dressed as a hot dog, passing out flyers to passersby; Luke is glaring at him.)
KIRK: Lunch at the Dragonfly! Get your lunch at the Dragonfly! You have not eaten lunch, till you have eaten lunch at the Dragonfly!
LUKE: I mean it, Kirk, get away from here!
KIRK: I am on the sidewalk, Luke! You do not own the sidewalk! The sidewalk is for the common people! The everyman! And every man and every woman would like to have a delicious lunch at the Dragonfly.
LUKE: I'm going to call the cops.
KIRK: Cops get free pie! With lunch at the Dragonfly! (Lorelai comes running up.)
LORELAI: Uh, Kirk, what are you doing? You're a giant hot dog.
KIRK: Technically I'm a giant wiener. The costume tag says "wiener".
LUKE: Get him away from my diner. I mean it.
KIRK: Don't you worry, Lorelai, I have no intention of abandoning my post, and I will not rest till every single person in Stars Hollow has tried lunch at the Dragonfly!
LORELAI: Kirk, I don't understand this.
KIRK: I'm trying to scrounge up a lunch crowd for you, so I figured I'd go where everybody already has lunch and get them over to you. And I'm doing a pretty good job, if I do say so myself!
LORELAI: But who asked you – ugh. Boy. Okay. Luke, I'm very sorry, this won't happen again. Come on, Kirk. I'm sorry, but why a hot dog? The Dragonfly doesn't serve hot dogs.
KIRK: Well, the kiesch made me look fat.
LUKE: If I see him around here again…
LORELAI: You won't. Let's go. (They walk away.)
KIRK: This is as fast as I can go in this outfit.
[Yale: courtyard]
(Rory is leaning against a pillar, waiting for Logan to walk by.) Logan's friend: It was funny, man, you should have been there.
RORY: Hey, Huntzberger!
LOGAN: Hey! You waiting on me?
RORY: Could be.
LOGAN: Wow, I'm flattered.
RORY: Your prerogative.
LOGAN: You here on business or pleasure?
RORY: I just thought maybe I'd give you a chance to respond to my article?
LOGAN: What article?
RORY: The article I'm doing on the Life and Death Brigade.
LOGAN: Don't really know what you're talking about.
RORY: You don't? Huh. I thought you would. It's a club. One of these super secret, super exclusive clubs here at Yale, membership spans a thousand centuries, secret handshakes and secret sayings, and a lot of running around in circles in your underwear, that kind of thing.
LOGAN: Sounds pretty secret.
RORY: Yeah. Anyhow, I'm doing sort of an expose on this one particular club and I figured, since you're in it, maybe you'd like to have your point of view included.
LOGAN: I'm in it.
RORY: Well aren't you?
LOGAN: I've yet to run around in a circle in my underwear.
RORY: Well. Okay. I mean, I have proof that your grandfather was in it, which means that your father was in it. Which should mean that you're in it. But maybe not. Okay.
LOGAN: Sorry to let you down.
RORY: No let down. It would have been nice, but I have plenty of stuff without you, and I'm sorry to have bothered you.
LOGAN: You have plenty without me, huh?
RORY: Oh yeah! I have the ball gowns, the girl in the gorilla mask, In Omnia Paratus – very fancy catch phrase, by the way – the license plate on the black SUV, and about a dozen other little things. I mean, getting an interview with an actual member would have been great. But I'm okay without it.
LOGAN: Well, great.
RORY: Yep. Plus I'm completely onto your routine now.
LOGAN: Wow.
RORY: Yeah. So I figure I'll just track you, and you'll eventually lead me there anyway. So, hey. I mean it would have been easier if you just would have talked to me now, but I can do it the other way if you want.
LOGAN: The other way.
RORY: Yes.
LOGAN: You tracking me.
RORY: Yes.
LOGAN: Following my every move?
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: I pick that way.
RORY: Okay, but –
LOGAN: We can start right now, if you want. I'm heading back to my room, I can keep the window open in case you feel the need to sneak in, and track me from the inside.
RORY: Thanks for the info.
LOGAN: Absolutely. (Turns to leave.) And hey, good luck with that article. Sounds like a hell of a scoop. (Walks away.)
[Dragonfly Inn: kitchen]
LORELAI: Sookie. What was the first thing we agreed on when we opened the inn?
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: Keep Kirk away from the business. Then I get a call from a not so jolly Luke and I run down there and find a giant hot dog handing out ten percent off flyers for lunch at the Dragonfly.
SOOKIE: Who was the giant hot dog?
LORELAI: Kirk was the giant hot dog.
SOOKIE: I didn't tell him to dress like a giant hot dog. Why would he dress up like a giant hot dog?
LORELAI: Because it's Kirk, Sookie – the giant hot dog suit was a given the minute you talked to Kirk. I don't understand what you were thinking.
SOOKIE: I was thinking we need to drum up some lunch business.
LORELAI: But, there is no lunch.
SOOKIE: Since when?
LORELAI: Since when? Sookie, we all agreed. Ann said.
SOOKIE: I did not agree. I did not agree to stop serving lunch.
LORELAI: Sookie, come on, it's the only thing we can do! We have to. You heard Ann, we can't afford this. Who's all this food for?
SOOKIE: All we need is a little time, and the people are going to come. And I paid Kirk out of my own money, by the way, so you don't have to worry about that.
LORELAI: I'm not worried about that, I'm worried about this.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: What are we going to do with all this food? Who's going to eat it? Why are there seven kitchen people working when the only person out there is Norman Mailer?
SOOKIE: Hey, this is what I do!
LORELAI: Sookie, we're dropping lunch. It's just temporary, but as of now, I'm sorry but it's gone.
SOOKIE: Fine. No lunch. From now on there's no lunch! Everybody stop what you're doing, because as of now there's no more lunch! (She storms out.)
[Dragonfly Inn: dining room]
SOOKIE: Boys! Yeah! Sorry to break up the party, but as of now, there's no more lunch! Yeah! It's been cancelled. You happy, Norman Mailer? Huh? Lunch has been cancelled! That means no more iced tea, uh-uh! No more lemon slices! No more hanging out at a restaurant, ordering nothing because you're Norman Mailer and you can! I mean, that's just like me coming into a bookstore, reading your books, without buying them! Hey, can I borrow this? Huh? I'm not going to pay for it, nope. I'm just going to stand here and read! Ooh, yeah. Someone sure likes to use his big words. (Lorelai rushes in.)
LORELAI: Can I get some more iced tea for the table? Excuse me, Mr. Mailer, I'm so terribly sorry. (She pushes Sookie back to the kitchen.)
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah! Yeah! What? What? Ha ha. Yeah, write that down!
[Dragonfly Inn: kitchen]
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: This is his fault!
LORELAI: It is not his fault!
SOOKIE: He takes up space! He drinks iced tea! He scares the other people off.
LORELAI: Sookie, he does not! Why are you being so nutty about this?
SOOKIE: I don't know! I don't know why I'm getting so nutty about this! I mean, I hear myself getting nutty and I know that there's no one coming for lunch! And I know that Norman Mailer is not responsible for no one coming for lunch! And I tell myself it's just temporary, and there's still dinner, and breakfast, and that's good, and I can do a lot with that, and I try to calm myself down and that just seems to only make me crazier and all I want to do is cry, and scream, and Oh! My God, I'm pregnant!
Lorelai (gasps): You're pregnant?
SOOKIE: Ooh, I'm pregnant! (They hug.)
LORELAI: Oh, oh. (Sookie runs into dining room.)
[Dragonfly Inn: dining room]
SOOKIE: Norman Mailer! I'm pregnant!
NORMAN MAILER: Congratulations. (She hugs him, giddy, and runs back to the kitchen.)
[Yale newspaper office]
(Rory looks up as Logan walks by.)
Rory (to Paris): Hey, you okay?
PARIS: Yeah. I think I had some bad host at one of the masses yesterday. (She walks away.)
(Rory receives an instant message on her computer.)
L > Hey Ace. I've got a proposition for you.
(She looks around and sees Logan watching her. She replies.)
R > sh**t.
L > I'll help you with your article. Get you the inside scoop. You just have to agree to a few conditions.
R > What conditions?
L > The first condition is you have to agree before you know the conditions. (a b*at) What do you say, Ace? You in or out?
(She smiles, then replies)
R > I'm in.
(She looks up and Logan is gone.)
[Luke's Diner: inside]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Is the hot dog with you?
LORELAI: No, Kirk is at home.
LUKE: Good. Make sure he stays there.
LORELAI: I will. So you still mad at me.
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: Seem mad.
LUKE: I'm not mad, just bugged.
LORELAI: Luke, I swear. Kirk will never bother your business on our behalf again.
LUKE: Oh, it's not that.
LORELAI: What then?
LUKE: I've got this table of bozos sitting over there all day long ordering nothing but iced tea. (Lorelai peeks over her shoulder at Norman Mailer and the reporter.)
STEPHEN: Why don't we focus on writing?
NORMAN MAILER: You know, I knew you'd come up with a question like that, it's like, why don't you push my Cadillac for me.
LORELAI: (Laughs) Aw, bummer.
[Chris' apartment]
(knock, knock, Chris answers.)
CHRIS: Rory, hey! What are you doing here? I – uh, here. Hey, it's good to see you, kiddo! (Hugs her) Uh, come on in, sit down. Uh, Gigi is asleep, which is basically a miracle, but what the hell, for you I'll wake her up.
RORY: No, that's okay. I can't stay long.
CHRIS: Well, some sit down.
RORY: No, I can't stay.
CHRIS: Okay.
RORY: I don't want you calling Mom anymore.
CHRIS: What?
RORY: I want you to stay away from her.
CHRIS: Rory, I –
RORY: Mom's in a relationship now, and she's doing really great. He's kind, and, well, he's there. And she's happy.
CHRIS: I think that's great, Rory. I –
RORY: You'll mess it up! You'll mess everything up! Because every time you come back, it always ends up the same way. Mom's crying and you're not being there and I know it's not your fault, I know you don't mean it to be that way, but that's how it is.
CHRIS: I just needed some help. That's all.
RORY: Well, next time you need help, call a nanny, or a babysitter, or call me. Just leave Mom alone. I'm sorry, I have to go. Kiss Gigi for me.
(She leaves, Chris hangs his head.)

[Elder Gilmore home: front door]
(Doorbell rings, maid answers the door.)
LORELAI: Oh, I'm late.
EMILY: I know.
LORELAI: Blame the insane people driving in front of me. They had a "honk if you love to scuba dive" bumper sticker on the back of their car, so I honked.
EMILY: You don't scuba dive.
LORELAI: Yes, but I've been testing people who have "honk" bumper stickers lately to see if they really want people to honk. Guess what? They don't. I lay on my horn, and this alleged scuba diver slows to a crawl in front of me just out of revenge, and I'm screwed.
EMILY: You need a hobby.
LORELAI: Yes, actually.
EMILY: Come on, Rory's waiting.
(They walk into the living room.)
RORY: Hey, what happened?
EMILY: She honked.
RORY: Oh, another bumper sticker test.
LORELAI: I just thought up a great idea for a reality show. You pull people over who have those "honk if you love whatever" bumper stickers, you kidnap them, and you make them do whatever the bumper sticker says they like to do, whether they do it or not. And then you make them eat bugs.
EMILY: So I hear you have a new boyfriend.
LORELAI (gasps): How did you - ?
RORY: Not from me.
EMILY: Don't jump on Rory.
LORELAI: How, Mom?
EMILY: Kirk told me.
RORY: Kirk?
LORELAI: Kirk who?
EMILY: How many Kirks do you know?
LORELAI: My Kirk? Stars Hollow Kirk? Kirk who hasn't started shaving yet, Kirk? How did you find out from him?
EMILY: I called the Inn looking for you, and Michel answered, but he was in the middle of some argument with the horse veterinarian. Then there was a cracking sound and the phone went dead. Then there was another man's voice saying "hello".
LORELAI: Kirk?
EMILY: Bob.
LORELAI: The gardener?
RORY: More twists than Oh Henry.
EMILY: He told me something in a heavy spanish accent, all while Michel was yelling at the vet in French -
LORELAI: I'll be, the UN erupts.
EMILY: Then Kirk came on. He was there delivering something. And when I told him I was looking for you, he said you were probably at your boyfriend Luke Danes' house. Now why were you hiding it from me?
LORELAI: I wasn't hiding it.
EMILY: You jumped on Rory when you thought she told me. You were hiding it.
RORY: She did not jump on me, Grandma.
LORELAI: Yeah, and I wasn't hiding it. The only reason I reacted to Kirk the way that I did is that he's not in this world, he's in my other world. It's as if I, out of the blue, told you I was having tea with Mrs. Van Uppity.
EMILY: Who?
LORELAI: Hortence Van Uppity, tight bun, lace collar, tiny poodle... fictional friend?
EMILY: You keep so much from me with these separate worlds of yours. It's not right.
LORELAI: I will try harder to merge the worlds. I promise.
EMILY: Well, start now. I want to meet this Luke Danes.
LORELAI: You've met him.
EMILY: Not in this capacity. I need to re-meet him.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sure that day will come.
EMILY: Next week.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: You have a gentleman friend of significance.
LORELAI: Rhett is my gentleman friend, yes.
EMILY: So it's only proper that you introduce him to your mother. Unless he's insignificant; I don't want to meet a passing ship. That's a waste of my time. Is Luke a passing ship? Is he insignificant?
LORELAI: No, he's not
EMILY: I'll get my book and we will pick a date next week.
LORELAI: Mom -
EMILY: Next week.
LORELAI: I -
EMILY: Next week.
(She goes to get her book.)
RORY: Honk if Emily Gilmore views your mind as her personal playground.
LORELAI: Honk, honk.
[Cut to opening credits.]
[Yale newspaper office.]
DOYLE: We eat it, we breathe it, it's our heart and lungs. What is it? The three basics: accuracy, accuracy, and accuracy. It's my head that went up on a platter, okay? So go the extra yard. Protect my head.
RORY: Headache, Doyle?
DOYLE: Charles Graw used to eat aspirin like candy. He ate candy like candy, too, hence the belly like jell-o. That was mean. The man's dead. So, how's the story coming? On that secret society.
RORY: The Life and Death Brigade. Get this. I've got a contact.
DOYLE: Inside?
RORY: Deep inside.
DOYLE: Who?
RORY: Anonymous. Don't ask again.
DOYLE: Your call.
RORY: I'm going to tell this story from the inside.
DOYLE: You'll be careful?
RORY: Careful enough.
DOYLE: Well, stay on it.
RORY: You bet.
DOYLE: I love this. We just had a very All the President's Men moment.
RORY: Very.
DOYLE: Moving around the newsroom like that, felt good.
RORY: Let's do it again sometime.
DOYLE: Now?
RORY: Might look silly.
DOYLE: Carry on.
RORY: Right, Chief.
[Luke's diner: interior]
CAESAR: There you are.
LANE: Club sandwich, burger well done, fries. Let me know if you need anything.
(She sees Zach hovering outside. Goes out to talk to him.)
LANE: Hey. What's up? You're acting all squirrelly.
ZACH: I'm ready now.
LANE: For what?
ZACH: To date.
LANE: Wow.
ZACH: That offer's still good, right?
LANE: Yeah, still good.
ZACH: Okay. So, we should pick a time.
LANE: Sure.
ZACH: How about now?
LANE: I'm kind of working.
ZACH: Right. How about tonight?
LANE: I've got band practice.
ZACH: Right.
LANE: And so do you.
ZACH: 'Cause we're in the same band. Okay. So, we'll figure it out.
LANE: We'll figure it out.
ZACH: Cool.
(Lane smiles.)
ZACH: See you at home.
LANE: Yeah, see you.
ZACH: Okay.
(Lane goes back into the diner. Lorelai is right behind her.)
LORELAI: Hey, Lane, how's it going?
LANE: Good, very good.
LORELAI: Oh, well, lucky you.
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: How dark is it?
LUKE: How dark is what?
LORELAI: The cumulus nimbus hovering over my head.
LUKE: Huh?
LORELAI: The black cloud. Was that a drop?
LUKE: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: I have some very bad news.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: My mother is insisting on having dinner with us.
LUKE: That's it?
LORELAI: Did you hear what I said? Mother, dinner, us? That's on a par with car, test, crash test dummy. Don't worry, I'm going to do whatever it takes to get us out of this. I promise.
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: What do you mean, why?
LUKE: Let's just do it, get it over with. Meeting the parents comes with the territory. We can't put it off forever.
LORELAI: Oh yeah? My fourth grade teacher wanted a meeting with my parents. She was hit by a bus six years ago. Never got the meeting.
LUKE: Book it.
LORELAI: Luke!
LUKE: Book it.
LORELAI: Okay. But I'm warning you. If I call and tell her, and then you change your mind and you want to back out, we're going to have to leave the country. And have extensive facial surgery, and sex changes. Both of us, so that we can, you know, kiss and not look funny.
LUKE: I'm not going to change my mind.
LORELAI: Okay, fine, I'll just call her now (pulls out her cell phone) - oh, whoa, what is happening? Something dark is happening here. It is heavy like iron. Oh, did you feel that ice cold wind that just passed through?
LUKE: Make the call.
LORELAI: I see dead people.
LUKE: Make the call.
(Lorelai dials the phone.)
[Elder Gilmore's house: exterior.]
(Luke and Lorelai get out of his truck and walk to the door.)
LUKE: This is a house?
LORELAI: This is a house.
LUKE: What a waste! See, this is what causes peasants to revolt. This is how heads end up on pikes.
LORELAI: Open with that. That's a great icebreaker. Now listen, I want you to be careful about your consumption of booze.
LUKE: I'm not going to drink too much.
LORELAI: No, no, no. You've got it backwards, there, Pablo. Ride the pink elephant, baby, 'cause it's your only defense against Emily Gilmore unless you're packing a Kolishnikov.
LUKE: Yeah, yeah. Shouldn't we ring the doorbell or something? (He rings the bell.)
LORELAI: Oh, a little strategy. (Picks up a plant stake and starts drawing in the dirt.) Here's the front door. We're here. Drink cart's here. It's knock, knock. Open the door. "Hi." "Hi." Turn left, veer right, past the couch, we're at the booze. Any questions?
LUKE: Uh, yeah. Shouldn't you get a massage or something?
LORELAI: Take off your coat.
LUKE: It's cold.
LORELAI: No, it's time consuming. Roll it in a ball and have it ready to hand off to the maid. Yeah.
(Maid opens the door.)
LORELAI: Hi, hello.
MAID: Hi, come in please.
LORELAI: Thank you. (Luke takes the plant stake.) Sorry.
MAID: Can I take your coats?
LORELAI: Yeah, got mine all ready.
(They enter.)
MAID: Alright.
LUKE: Here you go. I'm Luke.
MAID: I'm a maid.
LUKE: Yeah. Nice to meet you.
LORELAI: Oh, that was so sweet and innocent.
EMILY: Well, well, our honored guest. Welcome.
LORELAI: Mom, Luke. Luke, Mom.
EMILY: We've met, Lorelai. Several times.
LORELAI: Well, I was just "re-introducing" you, as per your instructions.
LUKE: Good to see you again, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Ah, no, it's Emily. I insist.
LUKE: Nice to see you, Emily.
LORELAI: Drinks?
EMILY: We're in the foyer.
LORELAI: Let's change that.
EMILY: Not if Luke wants a tour.
LORELAI (pointing): Oh, okay, well, foyer, staircase, upstairs, dining room, kitchen, weird piano area that we never really named, and right through here is the living room. (She goes.)
LUKE: Yeah, uh, I don't need a tour. Thanks.
EMILY: Well, then, let's go in the living room.
[Elder Gilmore house: living room.]
LUKE: Your house is beautiful.
EMILY: They don't make them like this anymore.
LUKE: I'll say.
EMILY: They make everything out of cardboard now. White boxes with heating vents.
LUKE: Yeah. The art of craftsmanship is dead.
LORELAI: Gin.
EMILY: Do you have Tourette's or something?
LORELAI: I'm sorry. I thought I heard you say what would I like to drink.
EMILY: I was getting there.
LORELAI: Gin martini, please.
EMILY: I already made a pitcher of martinis, but they're vodka.
LORELAI: Vodka's perfect. Double with a twist.
EMILY: So, two cold martinis with a twist, and Luke, how would you like a beer?
LUKE: Great.
LORELAI: Or maybe Luke would like to choose his own drink. That's a thought.
EMILY: Oh, yes, I'm sorry Luke. You can have whatever you like. I've got it all.
LUKE: Beer is perfect.
EMILY: Beer it is.
LORELAI: No, no, she's got everything. She's got scotch, she's got rum, she's got, uh, whiskey, she's got red wine, she's not kidding, she's got it all.
LUKE: Beer is perfect.
LORELAI: Okay, bring him a beer.
EMILY: Here we are.
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: Thank you, Emily.
EMILY: The beer is nice and cold. I almost want one myself.
LUKE: Hey, uh, you can have some of mine if you want.
EMILY: So, how's that diner of yours?
LORELAI: Uh...
LUKE: It's doing great. No matter what the economic climate, people gotta eat.
EMILY: That is so true. And I thought your place was very charming. Nice and rustic. (Lorelai clears her throat.)
EMILY: Do you need a cough drop?
LUKE: She's fine.
EMILY: Where'd your martini go?
LORELAI: To a happy place.
EMILY: Do you want another?
LORELAI: Does Pavarotti want another donut?
EMILY: That's a yes?
LUKE: I'll pour it, Emily.
EMILY: Thank you, Luke. I should go check on dinner. Will you excuse me?
LUKE: Absolutely.
EMILY: Thank you. (She goes.)
LUKE: Unbelievable.
LORELAI: I know, she didn't make nearly enough.
LUKE: I meant you, you're acting crazy.
LORELAI: She's insulting you!
LUKE: No, she's not. Your mom's being great.
LORELAI: What? Were you in the room? Did you not hear the awful things she said?
LUKE: What did she say?
LORELAI: Rustic diner? Rustic?
LUKE: So?
LORELAI: Backhand slang for crap pile.
LUKE: Or she was admiring its vintage feel.
LORELAI: Oh, what was the other word she used?
LUKE: Charming?
LORELAI: Ah, slang for doggie poopy.
LUKE: Unbelievable.
LORELAI: Wait, wait, what was the beer thing? Oh my God!
LUKE: That was nice. I wanted beer, she was considerate enough to anticipate that that might be the case.
LORELAI: The word beer, backhand slang for nitwit juice.
LUKE: You're reading way too much into this.
LORELAI: Excuse me, but I would defer to the Gilmore expert here. I am the oracle. I carry all the knowledge.
LUKE: Well, I would like you to calm down, because you're making me nervous.
LORELAI: I'm trying to protect you.
LUKE: I'm a grown man, and this isn't my first foray into the big city. I've dealt with all types of people in my life. Rich, poor, snobby, proud. I can handle it.
LORELAI: But -
LUKE: And by you jumping in after everything your mother says, makes me look weak. And I don't want to look weak.
LORELAI: I don't want you to either!
LUKE: Well, then, give me my space, okay? Please.
LORELAI: Okay, I'll give you your space.
(Emily returns.)
EMILY: Dinner is going to be as good as it smells, I guarantee it.
LUKE: It smells wonderful, Emily.
EMILY: Thank you, Luke. It's nice to have a kind gentleman in the house.
LUKE: Thank you.
EMILY: So, you're recently divorced?
LUKE: Uh, yeah, I guess. Although, it depends on what you'd call recently.
EMILY: In the last year, you've been divorced in the last year, that would be recent.
LUKE: Uh, yeah. Yes.
EMILY: Terrible, the divorce rate, isn't it.
LUKE: Yes, it's terrible.
EMILY: I'm sure it was inevitable in your case.
LUKE: Turned out that way.
EMILY: I hope there weren't children.
LUKE: No.
EMILY: Divorce destroys children. But, without children, you're only harming yourself. Of course, nowadays people get married for fun. Apparently there's nothing good on TV.
(Luke looks at Lorelai with pain on his face.)
[Yale dorms: Rory's room.]
(Rory walks in and presses a button on her answering machine.)
DEAN'S VOICE: Hey. It's Dean. Uh, so, we were supposed to get together day after tomorrow, but I have to cancel - again. One day, I'm going to have one job, not three, which will simplify everything. I hope. Anyway, um, I was hoping we could somehow hook up tomorrow night, I forget if you have something going on, but I've got a three hour window, and I was thinking dinner or something. Maybe we can meet halfway between Yale and Stars Hollow. That probably puts us on the interstate, meaning the six ninety-nine surf and turf special, but hell, I'm a cheap date. Uh, so, not the most romantic get together for us, but something's better than nothing. Let me know. Bye.
(As she listens to the message, she notices an envelope taped to the outside of her window. She reaches out and opens it and reads this note: "Be in your vestibule at four tomorrow. Blindfolded. The LDB." She reaches into the envelope again and pulls out a blindfold.)
ANSWERING MACHINE: End of messages.
[Elder Gilmore's house: dining room.]
EMILY: Diners are generally so filthy. I'm sure yours isn't, but the horror stories you hear. I read that one in Vermont got caught serving k*ll. Do you know what that is?
LUKE: Uh, yeah, it's, uh, dead animals from the street.
EMILY: From the street, from the backyard, fished out of pools. These diners find it and serve it. Again, probably not yours. But the fact that this place got away with it at all is astounding. I guess people who frequent diners don't look too closely at what they're eating out of self defense.
LUKE: We don't serve k*ll at my place.
EMILY: Well good for you. (pause.) I had a friend who ate at a diner once and the next day she dropped dead. Her family considered suing the place but there's nothing to get from these people. A couple of stools and a toaster. But they were sure it was a matter of hygiene and they eventually drove them out of the state. I don't want to tell you what they found when they moved the stove. Would you like another beer, Luke?
[Elder Gilmore house: outside.]
(Emily is walking Lorelai and Luke out.)
EMILY: ... Opiate for the masses. Well, so what? We all have our opiates. For some it's valet, for Luke it's baseball. Whoever I heard say it just happened to say it about what Luke likes. Oh, no! Some workman has left his filthy truck in our clean driveway! Richard must have sent for him.
LUKE: Oh, that's mine, actually.
EMILY: Oh. Well, it's nice. Rustic. I like the color.
LUKE: Thank you.
EMILY: And I like this coat of yours, there's something nice about simple cloth.
LUKE: Thanks.
EMILY: Well, this was wonderful. Don't be a stranger, all right?
LUKE: I won't. Thank you, Emily.
EMILY: Goodbye. Bye, Lorelai. (She goes back inside.)
LORELAI: Bye, Mom.
LUKE: Thanks, again.
(The door closes.)
LUKE: You know what's amazing, I mean truly amazing.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: She never said anything directly bad about me or the diner or anything else concerning me.
LORELAI: She's good.
LUKE: And all I did was thank her. Over and over. She'd hammer me, and I'd thank her.
LORELAI: It's a talent.
LUKE: "Rustic" really did sound like crap pile that time.
LORELAI: Come on, babe. You'll feel better about halfway home.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: Then the eye-popping nausea will hit you. The rich food mixes with the bitter memories and it all gets worse, and then it gets better.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: Until you get to Route 44, and then you hit bottom.
LUKE: Good. Great.
LORELAI: I'll be ready with a tongue depressor to keep you from swallowing your tongue. I keep them in my purse. Step up.
[Yale dorms: vestibule.]
(Rory is standing blindfolded as other students walk by.)
LOGAN: Hey, Ace, you ready? (reaches around a corner and pulls her by the arm.)
RORY: Well -
[Black SUV: interior.]
(Rory sits blindfolded in the middle.)
LOGAN: Hit it!
FINN: Ah! Not so loud!
STEPHANIE: You're very auditorily sensitive today.
FINN: Oh, and your voice helps.
COLIN: Is the blindfold secure?
LOGAN: Secure and in place.
COLIN: Our anonymity's crucial, Logan. Crucial.
(Finn groans.)
RORY: What's wrong with Finn?
COLIN: Great job with the blindfold, Logan.
RORY: I recognized your voices, Colin.
FINN: Could everyone keep it down, please.
RORY: Can we remove the blindfold now?
LOGAN: We're also hiding our destination.
FINN: We had to leave at this ungodly hour.
RORY: It's four in the afternoon.
LOGAN: He's got a thing about the sun.
FINN: It's too bright.
RORY: So how come you're not wearing your gorilla masks?
COLIN: She can see.
RORY: I can tell because your voices aren't muffled.
STEPHANIE: She's sharp.
RORY: Who's the girl?
STEPHANIE: I've been told we've met. I've no memory of it.
RORY: Oh, Gorilla Girl.
STEPHANIE: Oh, well, isn't that a pretty nickname.
LOGAN: Oh, by the way, this thing's overnight.
RORY: Overnight?
LOGAN: Didn't I mention that before?
RORY: Oh, must have slipped your mind.
LOGAN: That doesn't screw up anything for you, does it?
RORY: No.
LOGAN: No?
RORY: Nope.
LOGAN: Hmm. Loose schedule. Good.
FINN: We like our schedules loose, like our women.
COLIN: Clever.
FINN: My God, it's early.
[Luke's diner: interior.]
(Phone rings.)
LUKE: Luke's.
VOICE: Good afternoon, I'm calling for Mr. Luke Danes.
LUKE: This is Luke Danes.
VOICE: Please hold for Mr. Gilmore.
LUKE: What? For who? Hello?
RICHARD: Luke? Richard Gilmore here.
LUKE: Uh, uh, hi, Richard. Mr. Gilmore, sir, how are you?
RICHARD: I'm fine, thank you. Listen, I thought we could meet for a round of golf, you and I.
LUKE: Golf?
RICHARD: Tomorrow afternoon's good for me.
LUKE: Uh-huh.
RICHARD: Is that good for you?
LUKE: Well, uh...
RICHARD: Good. I'll have Margie call you back with the details.
LUKE: ... Okay.
RICHARD: Wonderful, I look forward to it. See you at the club.
LUKE: Yeah, see you at the club.
(Richard hangs up. Luke looks in disbelief at the phone in his hand.)
[Woods. Cars are parked. The black SUV pulls up near a table with old-fashioned lanterns on it.]
FINN: This mountain air has revivified me. (Laughs and runs off.)
LOGAN: Make sure he doesn't run off a cliff.
COLIN: Stephanie, it's your turn.
STEPHANIE: Finn! You slow down! (Grabs a lantern and follows.)
LOGAN: You okay?
RORY: I smell trees.
LOGAN: Oh, nothing gets past you. (Grabs a lantern and leads Rory into the woods.)
RORY: So the firing squad is just up ahead?
LOGAN: Yup, and there's a line. Damn.
RORY: Seriously, Logan, is the blindfold coming off, or am I Patty Hearst-ing it the whole trip?
LOGAN: It's coming off. It's coming off right now. (Pulls it off.)
(Rory opens her eyes to see a camp full of white tents, candles & lanterns, and turn-of-the-century furniture.)
RORY: Oh, my.
[Dragonfly Inn: office]
LORELAI (on cordless phone): You cannot go golfing with my father.
LUKE: It's a done deal.
LORELAI: What is that man up to? What is he doing?
LUKE: Ouch.
[Cuts back and forth between Luke's office and Lorelai's office.]
LORELAI: What are you doing?
LUKE: I'm looking for a book my dad had somewhere around here. "Learn Golf the Arnold Palmer Way." I can't find it.
LORELAI: I beseech you. Do not go golfing with my father.
LUKE: It's too late. I said yes.
LORELAI: Why? Why did you say yes?
LUKE: I had no choice.
LORELAI: Well, saying no is a choice. Did you learn nothing from the dinner with my mother?
LUKE: Apparently not.
LORELAI: Call him and cancel.
LUKE: Right, and how would he take that?
LORELAI: Badly, that's why you just hang up real quick.
LUKE: And this is a good way to start a relationship with your father.
LORELAI: No, this is the way to end it. God, you're slow. Listen, call him and tell him that, um, when he called, you had just dropped some paoti, and you were tripping, and you were seeing vapors, and that's why you agreed, but then you landed and realized that you can't go. Wait, do you smoke paoti? We should get that straight before you call him.
LUKE: Backing out will make it worse.
LORELAI: But do you even know how to play golf?
LUKE: I took a course in summer school but I accidentally hit Kent Calida in the head with a driver and got asked to leave, but I think I remember the basics. Grab the club, whack a ball. I'll fake it.
LORELAI: Luke -
LUKE: Don't worry, I'll be fine.
LORELAI (sighing): Okay. Fine then, bye.
(She hangs up, then dials another number. Scene cuts to Elder Gilmore pool house, exterior. Richard is putting.)
LORELAI: Hi, Dad. I need a favor. The biggest favor I may ever ask you for, ever.
RICHARD: I don't like the sound of this.
LORELAI: Please cancel this golf game with Luke.
RICHARD: What? No!
LORELAI: But why? Why are you doing this? What is the point?
RICHARD: How is this even your business?
LORELAI: He's my boyfriend.
RICHARD: And this is my right. Your mother already met him. At a secret dinner I only found out about because her blabbermouth maid told my valet. So now, I want to meet him.
LORELAI: But you've already met him.
RICHARD: Well I need to re-meet him.
LORELAI: Why can't you and mom meet someone once and make it stick?
RICHARD: I insist upon this golf game.
LORELAI: He doesn't even golf.
RICHARD: He said he did.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, he whacked Kent Calida in the head with a club, okay? So you're taking your life in your own hands. You want to reconsider now, huh? You like your head, huh?
RICHARD: Lorelai, tee time is set, Luke has said yes to my proposal, and tomorrow he and I are golfing.
LORELAI: Have fun.
RICHARD: This is not about having fun, this is protocol.
LORELAI: Well, have a good protocol, Dad. Bye. (hangs up.)



[Woods. Rory and Logan are walking among the tents.]
LOGAN: Is this what you expected?
RORY: No, not at all what I expected.
LOGAN: Let me guess what you were thinking: sleeping bag, flashlights, keg, three boxes of stale Triscuits, half eaten bag of Oreos, some Doritos and a bong.
RORY: That may be exactly what I pictured.
LOGAN: You can apologize later. This is yours. (Opens a tent.)
RORY: Mine?
LOGAN: Not much closet space, but the view's decent.
RORY: It's cozy. (She goes inside.)
LOGAN: Festivities start in half an hour. (He leaves.)
(Rory sits on the bed and pulls out her phone.)
RORY: Dean, hi. It's me. I got your call. I would love to have dinner with you tonight, but something unbelievably unexpected came up, and it's going to keep me busy for a couple of days. I'd give you more info, but it's all a little Dali-esque and hard to explain. I'll fill you in when I get home. If I get home. Just kidding. I hope. Bye. (She hangs up and pulls out her notepad. An owl hoots in the distance.)
[Lane's bedroom.]
(Lane is preparing for her date with Zach. She goes out and meets him in the living room.)
[Lane's living room.]
ZACH: Am I early?
LANE: Right on time.
ZACH: You look good.
LANE: Thanks, so do you. Have I seen those pants?
ZACH: I got them from the bottom of my drawer. I forgot I had them.
LANE: Cool. So what do you feel like doing?
ZACH: We could drive somewhere. We just have to stop for gas... and add some oil, and put some air in the tires, and we'd have to stop by an ATM.
LANE: Or we could hang out here.
ZACH: Sure.
LANE: Yeah.
ZACH: Okay! Cool. Let's get a pizza, and watch something, and just hang out.
LANE: Great! (She hands him her purse and jacket.) What do you want to watch?
ZACH: Want to finish watching what we started last night?
LANE: Yeah. Great. (They sit down, and Brian walks in.)
BRIAN: Hey, guys. Ooh, Stop Making Sense. Great. (He sits between them.) This is where we left off last night.
ZACH: What are you doing?
BRIAN: Watching TV.
ZACH: Uh, Brian, this is a date.
BRIAN: What?
ZACH: Lane and I are kind of on a date right now.
BRIAN: You are? But this is what we did last night.
ZACH: I know.
BRIAN: So, last night was a date, too?
LANE: That was not a date.
ZACH: I was in my underwear.
BRIAN: But we did exactly the same thing, you just had no pants.
ZACH: Well, we're kind of starting to date, and this is what we're going to do.
BRIAN: So, where do I go?
LANE: Well, how about my room?
BRIAN: Really? You never let me in your room.
LANE: Well, now's your chance.
BRIAN: Great!
ZACH: Wait, hold on. (To Lane.) Shouldn't we leave your room empty?
LANE: Why?
ZACH: You know, in case the date goes good?
LANE: Brian, go in my room.
BRIAN: Thanks! (Runs in.) Man, it smells good in here.
(Zach turns the movie back on.)
[Woods.]
(Rory comes out of her tent and sees everyone dressed in turn of the century clothes. She catches up to a couple.)
RORY: Hey. Rory Gilmore. Um, this is quite a soiree. Are all the Life and Death Brigade gatherings this elaborate? (They ignore her. She wanders over to a group of guys.)
GUY #1: How about (?) social stands?
GUY #3: Ridiculous. Total stand-still for all in his vicinity. What do you say?
GUY #4: I concur totally.
GUY #1: Crazy construct if you think for a bit.
GUY #2: Dubious logic if you ask this thoughtful guy.
RORY: Hello, everybody.
GUY #3: My God.
GUY #1: Shocking.
GUY #3: Silly girl. Not adjusting to this proud point of ours.
GUY #4: Sad, this diminishing vision.
RORY: Excuse me?
GUY #4: Full count is six, I say?
GUY #3: Six, no doubt. Ay, again I concur.
GUY #4: Point in fact, daft lady, to catch on would prompt our congratulations.
RORY: It's a game?
GUY #3: At which you totally fail.
GUY #4: You want for instruction?
RORY: Apparently.
GUY #4: Said gap ‘twixt ‘d' and ‘f' shall not slip from lips in any word this group allows.
RORY: Said gap ‘twixt ‘d' and ‘f' … you're not using the letter ‘e'?
GUY #4: Said this thing our group did banish.
GUY #1: Loud, for all to drink in!
GUY #3: Daft girl.
RORY: So, no one is supposed to say the letter ‘e'.
GUY #4: My God, this woman hounds us with this thing I banish.
GUY #3: Dumbfound.
RORY: Um, I'll catch up with you guys later. Have fun. If that's what you're doing. (She walks away.)
GUY #4: Bloody horror, that woman.
GUY #1: Ostracism should occur, I think.
(Rory wanders through the camp.)
RORY: Hi, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE: Oh, good, you're using ‘e's. No champagne?
RORY: No, I'll have a little later. So, is Logan the head of the group?
STEPHANIE: There's no head of the group, Rory. We're an anarchy collective, we don't recognize leaders per se. Plus it's a secret. I shouldn't be talking to you. (Hiccups.) Warning sign.
RORY: Because the way that people act around him, Logan kind of seems…
STEPHANIE: Cute?
RORY: No.
STEPHANIE: No?
RORY: Well, yes, but –
STEPHANIE: There's a line to get to him.
RORY: Oh, no, I'm not looking to get in a line. I'm a reporter.
STEPHANIE: Bet you're a good reporter. And a very good girl. Oh dear, I'm talking to you. I shouldn't be talking to you. I have to k*ll myself now – excuse me. (She walks away.)
(Rory walks up to another group of guys.)
RORY: Hi. Hi. Um, I was wondering. Is the safari thing something you always do, or do you choose different themes?
GUY: May I quote Max Ernst?
RORY: Sure.
(The group walks away.)
(Later: Rory is sitting under a tree in view of the camp. Logan walks toward her with a lantern and a plate.)
LOGAN: How goes it, pariah?
RORY: Logan?
LOGAN: Word was a bear dragged you off.
RORY: No bear, I just wanted a quiet place to collect my thoughts.
LOGAN: You found it.
RORY: Thanks, I've eaten.
LOGAN: Good. This is for me. Sorry you're not getting much from the group. Took a little arm-twisting to get them to agree to let you come in the first place.
RORY: I don't need their cooperation. I've already filled two notebooks without their cooperation. Half of one without using the letter ‘e', but I could use yours.
LOGAN: Way too much salt on this.
RORY: I mean, this is pretty incredible, but it's just a preamble to the big stunt tomorrow, right?
LOGAN: It's Finn, he's Australian. They like salt.
RORY: How do you pay for this? Are there dues, or do you chip in, is there alumni sponsoring it? How is it organized? And what is happening tomorrow? Is it just as big, or bigger? And do people know that you're here? Park Rangers, or the landowner? Where are we? Are we still in Connecticut? And your answer cannot include the word salt.
LOGAN: Okay. I think it's time to fill you in on the conditions of you being here.
RORY: Okay.
LOGAN: First, no pictures. (Holds up her camera.)
RORY: Hey!
LOGAN: Aw, you'll get it back at the end of the trip. Second, no names.
RORY: I'm not exactly being introduced to anyone as it is.
LOGAN: Third, no physical descriptions of any of us. There are authority figures up and down Connecticut trying to nab us for things we may have done in the past. Naughty things.
RORY: Keep you anonymous.
LOGAN: What number am I on?
RORY: Just at third.
LOGAN: Fourth, no identification of our location.
RORY: I don't know where we are.
LOGAN: Fifth.
RORY: You're going to run out of -ifths.
LOGAN: Most important condition of all. You must agree not to interfere with the integrity of the event.
RORY: What is the event, and how could I interfere?
LOGAN: So you agree?
RORY: Yes, I agree.
(The camp breaks into song.)
RORY: It's pretty.
LOGAN: It's drunk.
RORY: Well it sounds pretty. I like it.
LOGAN: I didn't say I didn't like it.
GIRL'S VOICE: Logan?
LOGAN: Yeah?
GIRL: You coming?
LOGAN: I'll be right there. (To Rory) I'll leave the light for you, Ace. I won't need it.
GIRL: Hurry up, darling.
LOGAN: Here I am.
[Lane's house: living room.]
ZACH (turning off the TV.): David Byrne is a freak.
LANE: I love him.
ZACH: He's totally cool.
LANE: So.
ZACH: So.
LANE: This was nice.
ZACH: Yeah.
LANE: I like your place.
ZACH (laughs): Hm, right.
LANE: I have to get up early for work tomorrow.
ZACH: No problem.
LANE: So I should probably…
ZACH: Oh, right, right.
(They get up, holding hands, he walks her to her door.)
LANE: Goodnight Zach.
ZACH: Goodnight.
(She opens the door, Brian is asleep on her bed.)
LANE: Oh, no.
ZACH: This is bad news. Once he hits his REM state, Motorhead wouldn't wake him.
LANE: What do I do?
(Zach goes in and tosses Brian over his shoulder.)
LANE: He really is asleep.
ZACH: He's gained a couple of pounds, too.
(He heads toward the bunk beds, then turns back to Lane.)
ZACH: Okay, well, I had a really good time.
LANE: Me, too.
(They kiss.)
LANE: Night, Zach.
ZACH: Night, Lane.
(She goes into her room.)
[Woods: morning.]
(Logan walks through the camp in a tux. Rory comes out of her tent.)
RORY: Another day, another sartorial surprise.
LOGAN: Start getting ready yourself.
RORY: I am ready.
LOGAN: Dressed like that?
RORY: Well, I didn't have the "it's an overnight thing" warning, so unless you want me to fashion something out of pinecones, this is it.
LOGAN: That clothing is going to interfere with the integrity of our event and you agreed not to interfere with the integrity of our event.
RORY: All I've got is a washbowl, a towel and a toothbrush.
LOGAN: Is that all you've got? Look again, Ace.
(Rory goes back into the tent and looks around. Under the bed she finds a large white dress box.)
[Golf course.]
(Luke is waiting nervously. Richard is doing the same. They take a minute to recognize each other.)
LUKE: Excuse me, Mr. Gilmore?
RICHARD: Luke?
LUKE: Yeah, hi.
RICHARD: I don't remember you being this tall.
LUKE: Sorry.
RICHARD: Oh, it's nothing to apologize about. Where are your clubs?
LUKE: Oh, I just figured I'd, uh, rent some.
RICHARD: Oh, waste of money. Owning's the thing.
LUKE: Right.
RICHARD: There is no better place than our pro shop.
LUKE: Great.
RICHARD: Let's go get you some clubs.
LUKE: Excellent.
[Woods: Outside Rory's tent.]
(Logan waits. Rory comes out in a pale blue ball gown.)
RORY: I got your event integrity right here, mister.
LOGAN: Yep. I got an eye for dress sizes. We go this way.
[A field.]
LOGAN: Come on, hurry.
RORY: You try running in a crinoline.
LOGAN: We're late.
RORY: For what? The ritual sacrifice?
(Everyone is standing, wearing tuxes and gowns, listening to a speech.)
EMCEE: I do declare here gathered, one hundred and eighth assembly of the honorable Life and Death Brigade.
(Rory and Logan sneak in, Finn hands her a glass of champagne.)
RORY: He's using ‘e's.
EMCEE: Please raise your glasses. In Omnia Paratus!
GROUP: In Omnia Paratus!
(They turn to their partners and feed each other their champagne.)
LOGAN: Now you might want to cover your ears.
(A large gong is uncovered behind them.)
RORY: Why?
(The emcee bangs the gong with a loud "clang". Everyone cheers and runs into the field,
LOGAN: And to think some groups just go bowling.
(Later: A game of polo. The men are carrying carts which hold the ladies, who are leaning out the side, hitting a ball with mallets. Rory watches from the side. She wanders over to another area, where some guys are playing another game. One jumps off a table sideways onto a landing mat while another sh**t at him with a paintball g*n.)
sh**t: Pull! (sh**t.) Pull!
SPECTATORS: Good sh*t! Pure k*ll!
RORY: Is this safe?
SPECTATORS: No.
sh**t: Pull! …Damn.
SPECTATORS: Blame the g*n. I would.
(Rory walks toward Logan and Finn, who are playing the same game further away.)
FINN: Pull! Pull! All right, I'm bored. I want to be a target.
LOGAN: You're always a target, Finn.
FINN: In Omnia Paratus.
LOGAN (sh**ting): You want to interview Finn, Ace, you should do it quick. Pull!
RORY: Not bad.
LOGAN: Thank you.
RORY: So is this your big stunt?
LOGAN: Big stunt?
RORY: According to my research, you guys always do one big thing at your gatherings.
LOGAN: Pull!
RORY: Is this it?
LOGAN: Does it look like it?
RORY: I'm guessing no.
LOGAN: You answered your own question. Pull! You'll know it when you see it.
RORY: Good.
(Two guys walk by carrying Finn on a stretcher.)
FINN: I missed the mat.
LOGAN: Again?
FINN: I'll be fine. Don't worry about me. In Omnia! (He swoons.)
(Logan laughs.)
[Golf course: Richard is teeing up. He takes a swing.]
RICHARD'S CADDY: You're on your game today, Mr. Gilmore.
RICHARD: Indeed I am.
LUKE'S CADDY: Indeed.
LUKE: Indeed.
RICHARD: I'm going to speak to the board about these grounds. There are dry spots the length and breadth of this fairway.
LUKE: Hm. Oh, I'm up. Okay. Let's see… I think this one is… (His caddy shakes his head) not the one I want at all, but this one here… (Takes the club the caddy hands him)
LUKE'S CADDY: Oh, good choice. Let's take the tag off there.
LUKE: Good idea. Okay, ball goes down here.
RICHARD: Ah.
(Luke swings.)
LUKE: Aw, damn.
RICHARD: No problem.
LUKE: It's heading toward the wrong hole.
RICHARD: It's just a Mulligan, son. Try it again.
LUKE: Golf isn't my thing, you know. It's definitely a thing, but not my game.
RICHARD: Well, what is your main hobby?
LUKE: Uh… (to caddy) Give me a hobby, quick.
LUKE'S CADDY: Uh, reading.
LUKE: Reading. I read like crazy.
RICHARD: Wonderful! What have you been reading lately?
LUKE: Uh, books. You know, this, that. Dick!
RICHARD: Dick?
LUKE: That Dick guy, science fiction guy, Dick something, something Dick… I just read one of his.
RICHARD: Well, I'll bring Dick up on the internet, see what comes up.
LUKE: Wish I could remember that name.
RICHARD: You better hit your ball, son. We're stacking up. (Waves at the people behind them.)
LUKE: Right, yeah. Okay.
RICHARD: Just a second, guys, he's, uh, he's new.
(Luke swings.)
RICHARD: Not to worry, the cart's been dinged a thousand times.
LUKE: The guy driving it looked mad.
RICHARD: Not to worry. Let's go. (They start to walk.) So, have you put much thought into franchising?
LUKE: Franchising?
RICHARD: That diner of yours. Now is the time to jump. There are opportunities abounding in real estate right now.
LUKE: Eh, well, no, I haven't.
RICHARD: I'd concentrate on the eastern seaboard, first. Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts. I'd start with, uh, five to seven.
LUKE: Diners?
RICHARD: Something manageable. You'll need an investment banker, ah. Just ran into Herb Smith in the clubhouse, best banker in the business, I'll give him your number.
LUKE: Good.
RICHARD: So, once the first seven are a go, sh**t for the moon. National expansion. Set up a public corporation, issue an I.P.O.
LUKE: Yeah, sure. An I.P.O. Gotta set up one of those.
RICHARD: Have you ever gotten a straight razor shave?
LUKE: No.
RICHARD: Shaves you close, lasts for days. I'll give you my barber's card.
[Camp. Rory is looking up at a huge scaffold that has been set up in the field. Several people are standing on top holding umbrellas. Logan joins her.]
LOGAN: Hope you're thinking up superlatives.
RORY: What are they going to do?
LOGAN: What do you think they're going to do?
RORY: They're not going to jump.
LOGAN: Jump!
RORY: That's like seven stories! They'll die!
LOGAN: We're all going to die one day.
RORY: But those four are today.
LOGAN: Six.
RORY: I see four.
LOGAN: I'm heading up.
RORY: Of course you are.
LOGAN: And Finn was supposed to do it, but few of us figured he'd make it this far, so there's an extra space.
RORY: Hmm. (Looks up, then sees the way Logan's looking at her.) No!
LOGAN: And we're not going to die. No one in the Life and Death Brigade has ever died. Old ones have.
RORY: I am not going to jump!
SETH: We're all set.
LOGAN: This is Seth, he's the genius behind all this.
SETH: It's very safe. We did a dozen successful test drops, every potato came through without a scratch.
RORY: Potato?
LOGAN: You can't test using people, that'd be dangerous!
RORY: Look, thanks for the offer, but I'm here as a journalist. An observer. Journalists do not participate.
LOGAN: Since when?
RORY: Since forever.
LOGAN: George Plimpton never participated.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: His best stuff put him in the think of it. Fighting Sugar Ray Robinson, quarterbacking for the Lions, skating for the Bruins.
RORY: So he participated.
LOGAN: Bill Buford lived with soccer hooligans in amongst the thugs. Ernie Pyle was so deep in the action in World w*r II, he was k*ll by a Japanese sn*per, not that you gotta go that far.
RORY: Buford, Pyle. I know.
LOGAN: Richard Hottelet was four months in a n*zi prison working for the U.P. Hunter Thompson lived with the Hell's Angels. Got in the muck, didn't just orbit around it, and it drove his writing. He put you in those biker's parties. He put you in those biker's heads.
RORY: All right, all right, so, those guys participated. I got it, but I –
EMCEE: Jumpers to their places, please!
LOGAN: You're scared.
RORY: Well, yeah!
LOGAN: And that stops the greats?
RORY: It's stopping this great!
LOGAN: Come on, you look like you need a little adventure.
RORY: What does that mean?
LOGAN: You're just a little sheltered.
RORY: Why? Because I haven't spent time in a n*zi prison, been stomped on by hooligans and b*at up by Hell's Angels? And Plimpton got banged up pretty good too.
LOGAN: It'll be fun, it'll be a thrill. Something stupid, something bad for you. Just something different. (Rory smiles.) Isn't this the point of being young? It's your choice, Ace. People can live a hundred years without really living for a minute. You climb up here with me, it's one less minute you haven't lived.
RORY: Let's go.
LOGAN: Let's go!
RORY: But I am not a fan of ladders.
LOGAN: They scare the crap out of me, too.
(They climb the scaffold.)
RORY: High. We are very high.
LOGAN: I've been higher.
RORY: I meant distance from the ground.
LOGAN: That, too.
SETH: This is totally safe. And it goes with your outfit. Nice. (He wraps a band around her waist, which a line is connected to.)
RORY (pointing down at the crowd): Why do they look so worried?
LOGAN: We're low on champagne. You can back out, you know. No one's forcing you.
RORY: I know. (She grabs an umbrella.)
(The emcee is calling up in Latin.)
LOGAN: You trust me?
RORY: You jump, I jump, Jack.
CROWD: In Omnia Paratus!
LOGAN: I really should have confirmed that those potatoes were okay.
(He grabs her hand and they jump. The crowd cheers as they land safely.)
SETH: Oh, thank God.
LOGAN: You did good, Ace!
RORY: Once in a lifetime experience!
LOGAN: Only if you want it to be.
[Dragonfly Inn.]
LORELAI: (To customers) All right, thanks. (The phone rings.) Good afternoon, Dragonfly Inn.
LUKE: I franchised my place.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: The diner. There's going to be seven of them, and that's just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I'm going national.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
LUKE: Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke's Diners, and I think I agreed to it.
LORELAI: No!
LUKE: I've already got a marketing guy, Herb's my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!
LORELAI: Ugh! My parents, my stupid parents!
LUKE: And he wants to shave me.
LORELAI: Shave what?
LUKE: I don't know, he just kept talking about shaving me, and I'm tipsy. We hit the club bar, and I didn't want to sound dumb and just order a beer because it's nitwit juice, so I had what your dad was having which was whiskey something – more whiskey than something, let me tell you, ‘cause I can't even see straight.
LORELAI: Aw, you poor thing.
LUKE: And I've got an art dealer now.
LORELAI: No!
LUKE: I'm driving to Manhattan next week to look at some Diebenkorns. What's a Diebenkorn?
LORELAI: I don't know.
LUKE: Oh, and I bought some golf clubs, they cost the same as a car.
LORELAI: Where are you now?
LUKE: I'm at the driving range, your dad's making me practice for next time.
LORELAI: No! Leave! You do not need to practice.
LUKE: Oh, and I sort of implied that I'm fond of the Greeks, so I have to read the Iliad and the Odyssey so we can chat about it, and can we not hang out with your parents for a very long time?
LORELAI: For a very long time.
LUKE: I mean, I don't hate them.
LORELAI: Leave the driving range at once.
LUKE: I don't think I can drive.
LORELAI: Honey, have some coffee and then come home.
LUKE: The Diebenkorn guy is still in there.
LORELAI: You stay away from the Diebenkorn guy.
LUKE: He's chatting with my rare coin guy.
LORELAI: Just do not go back in the clubhouse. Go straight to your car.
LUKE: Okay. I like the valet guys.
LORELAI: Good, now go.
LUKE: I'm going.
(She hangs up.)
[Elder Gilmore's pool house: at the door.]
EMILY: Why would you go golfing with that man? Why on earth?
RICHARD: Who, Luke?
EMILY: You are encouraging this ridiculous relationship.
RICHARD: Emily, please.
EMILY: He is not good enough for Lorelai, or to be Rory's stepfather! God forbid!
RICHARD: Can we be a little more of a snob, Emily?
EMILY: The fact that you paraded him around the club. Our club!
RICHARD: It happened to be a fruitful outing. I am going to assist him in franchising his diner.
EMILY: Richard! That hurts-out-loud is not capable of running a complex business!
RICHARD: Well, that's obvious, Emily! That's why he will have no significant role, he will be the frontman! We'll shave him, stick his picture on the menus. The whole thing will, hopefully, bestow some credibility on him. At least then, if this insane relationship between him and Lorelai continues, we can legitimately take him to places like the club. At least, on holidays.
EMILY: This is absurd. You're absurd, the whole thing's absurd.
RICHARD: And you're not thinking ahead. Excuse me. (He goes inside.)
[Yale dorms; Rory's bedroom.]
(Rory is going over her notes when her phone rings.)
RORY: Hi.
LORELAI: Are you typing?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Yes, you are. I thought we agreed you wouldn't type while we talk.
RORY: Gotta break the rule just this once, I'm in a rush. It's been a crazy couple of days.
LORELAI: Oh, school?
RORY: Paper. Long story, I'll fill you in in person. Where are you off to?
LORELAI: Luke's! I have to un-stress him after his unhappy Gilmore outing. Dad tried to take over his whole life. He wants to franchise Luke's.
RORY: You're kidding.
LORELAI: Hey, do men shave anywhere except their faces?
RORY: I don't know, I've never lived with a man.
LORELAI: Same here.
RORY: Well, if he does franchise the diner get him to put one near Yale. I miss those burgers.
LORELAI: He's not franchising.
RORY: Hey, can I ask you a question?
LORELAI: Sure.
RORY: Do you think I'm too scared?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Too scared, too timid. Do I take enough chances?
LORELAI: What kind of chances?
RORY: I don't know, life chances.
LORELAI: I think you do.
RORY: I'm not a mouse?
LORELAI: Where is this coming from?
RORY: I don't know, just something I've been thinking about lately. (She hears a knocking.) Someone's at the door. Um, say hi to Luke for me.
LORELAI: If he's out of comatose. By, honey.
RORY: Bye.
(She opens the door and finds a gorilla mask, a bottle of champagne and her camera. She looks through the shots on her camera, and sees pictures of her and Logan jumping. She smiles and closes the door.)

[Elder Gilmore Pool House: terrace]
LORELAI: I smell meat, is that meat?
VALET: Why, yes, miss, it is meat.
LORELAI: Oh, he called me miss. There's meat and a miss, I'm happy.
RORY: What's the occasion?
RICHARD: Well, I thought we might like some appetizers with our cocktails tonight.
LORELAI: Would we ever.
VALET: The first batch is ready, sir.
RICHARD: Wonderful, on the table please.
LORELAI: Mm, God it smells good.
RORY: I love a good steak on a stick.
RICHARD: Me, too.
RORY: We should form a club.
LORELAI: Steak-On-A-Stick club.
RICHARD: We could have t-shirts made up.
RORY: Grandpa, I've never seen you wear a t-shirt.
RICHARD: Well, I've just never found a proper occasion.
LORELAI: Hmm. To the proper occasion. [They toast.]
RICHARD: I'll drink to that.
EMILY [storming in]: I knew I smelled something, you're barbecuing!
RICHARD: So what?
EMILY: So what? The agreement was the girls have drinks with you and dinners with me!
RICHARD: We are having drinks. Drinks and appetizers.
EMILY: Those are not appetizers! Those are skewers!
LORELAI: Little skewers.
RORY: Little tiny skewers.
EMILY: This is not tiny! [She rips a skewer from Lorelai's hand as she's about to bite.]
LORELAI: Mom, that's mine!
EMILY: This is a main course and a cheap way of cheating me out of my dinner.
RICHARD: You are the most paranoid woman I've ever met.
EMILY: I highly doubt that.
RICHARD: You were the one who designated the drinks portion of the evening to me.
EMILY: You love drinks.
RICHARD: Drinks last one hour at most. Then you get the dinner portion, which can last several hours. Especially the way you structure things. You get more time. I should at least be able to serve appetizers with my drinks.
EMILY: Fine. I'll leave. Have you drinks and your appetizers. [Points at
RORY and Lorelai.] You two better be hungry when you get inside, or else! [Leaves.]
LORELAI [whispers, mimicking]: Or else!
RORY: Sounds serious.
LORELAI: So, one more?
RORY: Well, two more at the most.
LORELAI: Yeah, 'cause she was really mad.
RORY: Mm-hmm.
[Elder Gilmore house: dining room]
[Awkward silence.]
EMILY: Something wrong?
LORELAI: No, why, why?
EMILY: You're not eating.
LORELAI: No, I am eating.
EMILY: You've taken two bites.
LORELAI: Two really big bites.
EMILY: Rory's taken none.
RORY: I did, you just missed it.
EMILY: You're full.
LORELAI: No!
EMILY: He can't stick to a simple agreement! He makes deals all the time in business, but "drinks there, dinner here", somehow that's too difficult for him to manage.
RORY: He was just -
EMILY: He was trying to upstage me. He was trying to make his part of the evening the "fun" part. He's a child. A spoiled four-year-old. I should take his dump truck away and send him to bed without supper. Or, as he calls it, appetizers.
LORELAI: Mom, seriously, we are starving. Look. Mmm, wow. [To Rory] Eat some carrots, eat some carrots.
RORY [weakly]: Carrots. Delicious.
EMILY: Well, if you're both that hungry, you must want more. Olga! Good timing! The girls are famished. Load 'em up.
[Olga serves up more food. A cell phone rings.]
EMILY [scolding]: Lorelai!
LORELAI: What? It's not me!
RORY: It's me, Grandma. I'm sorry. [Checks caller ID] I have to take this. Promise I'll be quick. [She gets up to leave.] Hello? Hi. No, now's fine.
EMILY: Who's she talking to?
LORELAI: How should I know?
EMILY: Well, you're the one who taught her to leave her cell phone on at the dinner table.
LORELAI: That's for safety, Mom. In case someone forces her to eat five chickens and she has to call 911.
EMILY: She's talking to a boy, isn't she?
LORELAI: I don't know.
EMILY: She certainly sounds like she's talking to a boy. Does she have a new boyfriend?
LORELAI: Mom!
EMILY: Did she finally meet someone at Yale?
RORY: I don't know.
EMILY: Oh, of course you know!
LORELAI: Because I'm the one who taught her to leave her cell phone on at the dinner table?
RORY [coming back in]: Sorry, Grandma. That won't happen again.
EMILY: That's all right. So, who were you talking to?
RORY: Dean, you remember Dean?
EMILY: The boy who made you the car?
RORY: Yep.
EMILY: I didn't know you were still seeing him.
RORY: Umm, well, we got back together recently.
EMILY: Really? Well, that's a surprise, isn't it, Lorelai?
LORELAI: I know. I'm floored!
RORY: He's been working crazy shifts lately and I've had so much schoolwork that we keep missing each other, so I told him to call me tonight.
EMILY: Well thank you for telling me. I'm just glad I got to hear it from you and didn't have to pick it up on the street somewhere.
LORELAI: 'Cause you hang out on the street so often, Mom, you and Melrose Larry Green.
EMILY [Glares at Lorelai, then turns to Rory]: So, are you happy with this
DEAN?
RORY: Yes, I am.
EMILY: Well, good. Now eat up, we have the fish course coming.
LORELAI: Fish course?
EMILY: Yes, Olga makes a mean pickled herring.
LORELAI: Oh. Well. What a delightful k*ll.
[Elder Gilmore house: exterior]
[Rory and Lorelai walk sluggishly out of the house.]
RORY: Grandma's mean.
LORELAI: If it flew, swam or crawled on this earth we just ate it.
RORY: I can't breathe. [Lorelai pinches her.] Ow! What was that for?
LORELAI: 'Cause you told my mother about Dean.
RORY [rubbing her arm]: What do you mean?
LORELAI: Well, I was totally covering for you with the phone call, and then you waltz back in and just tell her?
RORY: My arm is swelling up!
LORELAI: You were totally off the hook. I was very k*ll covering for you. Well, not k*ll, but there was a certain aplomb to my evasiveness.
RORY: I'm not going to lie to Grandma about Dean. Why should I?
LORELAI: Because she's her.
RORY: Mom, I am with Dean. She's already met him, Grandpa's already met him, what is the problem besides this permanent welt on my arm?
LORELAI: All right, fine. [sighs] You know, I'm actually hungry.
[Pool house. A knock on the door. Richard goes to answer it.]
EMILY: We need to talk. [She walks in, uninvited.]
[Opening credits.]
[Luke's Diner. Lane is refilling the coffee pot.]
LANE [to Luke]: The man at table three wants to send an orange juice to the woman at table four.
LUKE: As long as he's paying.
LUKE [To Liz, reading a paper at the counter]: If someone who wants to eat comes in here...
LIZ: I'm outie, I got it.
LORELAI [Coming in]: Hey, Lane.
LANE: Hi! Oh, potential hookup at table four!
LORELAI: Oh, wow, diner love. "Over easy" takes on a whole new meaning. [Sits at the counter next to Liz.] Hey, Liz!
LIZ: Hey!
[They hug, genuinely happy to see each other.]
LORELAI: I didn't know you were back!
LIZ: Yeah, just cruised in.
LORELAI: Well how are you? How's TJ?
LIZ: He's great. He's gotten taller.
LORELAI: I'm so glad to hear it.
LIZ: So you and my brother, uh?
LORELAI: Yeah, well...
LIZ: I'm so jazzed. I want private details.
LUKE: Tell her nothing.
LORELAI: Really, nothing? Not even about your Canadian mountie hat?
LUKE: Liz, you have been sitting there for over an hour.
LIZ: I know. I'm almost done.
LORELAI: Whatcha doing?
LIZ: TJ and I are thinking about buying a winter place, you know, something nice for when the Renaissance Fair season's over.
LORELAI: You're moving to Stars Hollow?
LUKE: No.
LIZ: Thinking about it. There's some great places for sale around here.
LUKE: They're not for sale, they've all been sold.
LIZ [ignoring him]: Plus there's a few stores around here that are willing to sell my jewelry on consignment. And I'd like a house, you know, with a fence and a lawn...
LUKE: No lawns in Stars Hollow, we had them taken out.
LIZ: Hey, how much did you pay for your house?
LUKE: Oh, don't ask her that. You can't ask people questions like that.
LIZ: Why not?
LUKE: 'Cause you can't! [To Lorelai] Don't tell her how much you paid for your house. [To Liz] You don't want to live here.
LIZ: Yes I do.
LUKE: It's too quiet for you.
LIZ: I like quiet.
LUKE: You do not like quiet. TJ does not like quiet. He likes monster trucks, and baboons that get really mad at the zoo.
LIZ: That's true, he does like that.
LORELAI: Luke, stop. You're going to like living so close to your family.
LUKE: Yes, I've seen how much you enjoy living so close to yours. What can I get you?
LORELAI [Looks at the menu]: Hmm. Nothing looks good.
LUKE: I'll make you a burger.
LORELAI: I don't want a burger.
LIZ: Make her your gumbo. Oh, he makes the most amazing gumbo.
LORELAI: You make gumbo?
LIZ: And great Mexican food.
LORELAI: Really?
LIZ: Makes his own tortillas.
LUKE: Gotta make your own tortillas. The ones in the package are crap.
LIZ: And garlic soup, and paella... He was really into lasagna for a while, got obsessed. Made hundreds of lasagnas trying to find the perfect recipe. He wore an apron -
LUKE: Okay! Liz, you don't even live here yet.
LIZ: Fine. I gotta bail anyhow. TJ's meeting me at the realtor's office.
LORELAI, it was great seeing you again.
LORELAI: You too!
LIZ: Later, bro.
LUKE: Uh-huh.
[Liz leaves.]
LORELAI: You've been holding out on me.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Um, paella, gumbo, lasagna king?
LUKE: You know, I have many talents, okay?
LORELAI: I know. I mean, the way you keep that mountie hat perfectly balanced the entire time we're -
LUKE: Okay, so, if you keep making mountie hat jokes, you're going to eventually believe that there's an actual mountie hat.
LORELAI: Well, I'm very impressed. Or at least I would be, if I had any proof of these extraordinary cooking k*ll of yours.
LUKE: Okay. I'm going to cook you the most amazing meal of your life.
LORELAI: This weekend?
LUKE: Stop making the mountie jokes and you're on.
LORELAI: Deal. Blueberry muffin to go?
LUKE: You got it. [He gets the muffin. She's looking at him strangely.] You're still picturing me in a mountie hat, aren't you?
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
LUKE: How do I look?
LORELAI: Mm, I'll tell you this weekend.
[She leaves, Kyon enters. Lane rushes over.]
LANE: You cannot put those flyers here! I'm surprised that my mother told you that you could, but you can't! So, go stand on a street corner like I had to do, ages six through fourteen! [Kyon just stands there.] Go! What?
KYON: I'm so hungry.
LANE: What?
KYON: It's flaxseed muffin month. Flaxseed muffin in the morning, flaxseed muffin at night. I'm having trouble lifting my toothbrush.
LANE: Okay, come here.
KYON: Not fast, please.
LANE: Sit.
KYON: She made a lot of food with flaxseed. It lasts a very long time.
LANE [Sets down a plate of fries]: There.
KYON: What's this?
LANE: Fries.
KYON: But Mrs. Kim, she says that fries are the devil's starchy fingers.
LANE: They're hot and delicious and they don't have any flaxseed in them.
KYON: But they are a gateway food. They lead into harder things. Pizza, movie popcorn, deep fried Snickers bar...
[Lane waves the fries under her nose.]
KYON: Oooh. [takes a bite.] Oh, my.
LANE: Welcome to America.
[Yale: cafeteria.]
RORY: So now I've got three days to do this comparative religion paper, and the teaching fellow who runs our group spends all his time explaining to us how much he disagrees with the professor, and - what are you looking at?
PARIS: That guy over there is staring at me.
RORY: Which guy?
PARIS: The one in the Santa Claus red sweater.
RORY: Professor Prady?
PARIS: Shh! He'll hear you.
RORY: You think Professor Prady is looking at you?
PARIS: He is more than looking at me. God, this is so annoying. Ever since word leaked out about me and Asher, every faculty member over fifty thinks I'm easy.
RORY: Paris, I don't think Prady's hitting on you.
PARIS: You are so naive. He's practically licking his lips. You sleep with one old guy, and suddenly you're Catherine Zeta-Jones.
[Rory's phone rings.]
RORY: Hello?
EMILY: Rory, it's your grandmother.
RORY: Oh, hey, Grandma.
EMILY: Your grandfather is here also.
RICHARD: Hello, Rory. How are you?
RORY: Fine, Grandpa, and you?
RICHARD: We're wonderful, thank you for asking.
EMILY: Rory, we're sorry to bother you at school, but next Friday your grandfather and I agreed to host a little Yale alumni event at our house.
RICHARD: It completely slipped our minds the other night.
EMILY: So we'll have to cancel our usual Friday night dinner.
RORY: Oh. That's okay.
EMILY: However, we were wondering if maybe you'd like to come.
RORY: Me?
RICHARD: The alumni always like to meet the next generation of Elis, and plus, we'd love to be able to show you off to all of our friends, wouldn't we, Emily?
EMILY: Yes, we would!
RICHARD: You might even make a few connections that could come in handy somewhere down the road.
EMILY: Please come! We'd hate to miss our weekly Rory fix. And I promise you, there won't be any chicken.
RICHARD: Or steak on a stick. [They laugh, the whole conversation sounds very rehearsed.]
RORY: Well, sure. I'd love to come.
RICHARD: Wonderful. Your grandmother and I are thrilled.
RORY: Is it fancy? What should I wear?
EMILY: Oh, just pick out a pretty little dress.
RICHARD: And bring that face.
RORY: Well, the face comes with the package.
EMILY: Oh, and I know you usually come at seven, but could you make it at six instead?
RORY: Six is fine.
RICHARD: We'll see you Friday.
RORY: See you Friday. [She hangs up.]
PARIS: What's going on Friday?
RORY: My grandparents are having a party.
PARIS: Damn it. [She gets up.] Dean Treadwell just came in. He's been throwing sex daggers out his eyes at me all week. [She picks up her plate and leaves. Rory turns around and sees a feeble-looking old man with a cane entering.]
[Luke's diner.]
LANE: Chili fries, extra cheese and onions.
KYON: Thank you. [Folds her hands.]
LANE: Didn't you just say grace?
KYON: Yes, but that was for the soda.
LANE: Kyon, tip, if you pray over every single thing you eat you might never be able to leave the table. Breakfast will run into lunch which will run into dinner.
KYON: I'm telling God I'm thankful!
LANE: He gets it. Do a blanket thank you and move on.
[Zach bursts in.]
ZACH: We've got free passes to Tory's band on Saturday.
LANE [excited]: No! Seriously?
ZACH: Totally seriously. All we have to do is carry the equipment and we are in.
[Lane shrieks and jumps on him.]
ZACH: Okay, cool, you're jazzed. So I'll tell him it's a go?
LANE: It's a total go.
ZACH: You free for dinner tonight?
LANE: We'll discuss it when I get home.
ZACH: Okay. Bye.
LANE: Bye.
[Zach leaves, while Liz and TJ enter.]
TJ: Ladies and gentlemen, I am in escrow.
LUKE: You're what?
TJ: I am in escrow, I've got the paperwork to prove it.
LUKE: What is he talking about?
LIZ: We bought a house!
TJ: Beautiful. White.
LUKE: You just started looking.
LIZ: I know, we bought the first home we saw.
LUKE: Oh, Liz.
LIZ: No, I'm telling you, I walked into this place, and just felt it.
LUKE: Felt what?
LIZ: The vibe.
TJ: That's right, she felt the vibe and now I'm in escrow.
LUKE: Did you at least have an inspector look at this place?
TJ: Hey, we don't need some guy with a clipboard to tell us what we already knew, which was this white house was for us!
LIZ: Please don't be worried about this, the place is great.
TJ: It's on a corner, it's got room for a pool, it's air-conditioner ready, it's, uh, landscaper ready, it's lawn ready, and it's got three bedrooms, if you build on two.
LUKE: It's got a roof, right?
TJ: Of course it's got a roof. And as soon as we replace it it won't leak as much.
LIZ: Just be happy, okay?
LUKE: Oh, sure.
TJ: That's right, buddy, smile, man, 'cause I'm in escrow! [yells out] Coffee! On the house! You like that, on the house?
LUKE: You're paying for coffee for the entire diner?
TJ: What am I, made of money? I'm in escrow! Throw in the coffee, buddy, we're celebrating.
LANE: I got it.
LIZ: You're not really bugged we're moving here, are you?
LUKE: Does he even know what escrow means?
LIZ: I doubt it, but he's so happy.
TJ [High-five-ing strangers]: I'm in escrow. [To Kyon] Give it up, sister, I'm in escrow.
[Yale: Rory is walking the halls talking on her cell phone.]
RORY: So, you're off the hook.
LORELAI: Off the hook, for what?
RORY: Friday night. Grandma and Grandpa are having a party for their Yale alumni friends.
LORELAI: Really? This is news!
RORY: So you're free as a bird.
LORELAI: Wo-ow, Friday night without my mother! I don't know if I can deal! You might have to come over and force-feed me pickled herring and tell me what a disappointment I am. Hey, you want to go to the movies?
RORY: Can't, I'm going to the party.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: They asked me to.
LORELAI: Huh. Okay. I can get you out of it.
RORY: Mom -
LORELAI: Whoop, hold on, just a moment. Let me formulate a plan.
RORY: I don't need to formulate a plan, I want to go.
LORELAI: You don't want to go, you feel obligated to go. That's very different.
RORY: Mom, they're giving the party together.
LORELAI: Ooh, I got it. Transfer to Harvard, then you won't be invited.
RORY: Are you listening?
LORELAI: Rory, they're just manipulating you.
RORY: Yes! Exactly! Them. Both of them, together. They called me together. They were on the speakerphone together, which means that they were in the same room, at the same time, together.
LORELAI: So what you're saying is, they were together?
RORY: Exactly!
LORELAI: Whose antennae are up besides mine?
RORY: Maybe they made up.
LORELAI: They would have told us.
RORY: They didn't tell us they broke up.
LORELAI: Yes, but that's because it looked bad. They didn't tell people I was pregnant 'till my eighth month. My mother kept getting numbers for fat farms from her friends.
RORY: They sounded so happy. They sounded like they used to.
LORELAI: Are you sure you want to go?
RORY: I'm sure.
LORELAI: All right. Don't let Grandpa and his cronies make you sing Whiffenpoof songs all night.
RORY: I won't.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to see you on Friday.
RORY: Well, how about I come by after? I can stay the night and then you can take me shopping on Saturday.
LORELAI: Ah, the lucky girl.
RORY: Okay. Bye.
[Stars Hollow street: newsstand.]
ZACH: Hey, Amir! Where's this month's Guitar magazine? I wasn't done reading it yet.
AMIR: You buy it, then you read.
ZACH: What kind of bogus system is that?
AMIR: It's the bogus system called this is a magazine stand, where people come to buy, not hang out and read for free!
ZACH: That's a long freaking name for your bogus system, buddy.
[Mrs. Kim storms across the street.]
MRS. KIM: You! You dirty, filthy devil boy! You will pay for this. You will burn in hellfire for this! You will swim in the sludge with Satan's hell-dogs, and feed them your innards for eternity!
ZACH: Ah, is this about the magazine?
MRS. KIM: She's an innocent girl. And you are a wild pig of filth! I know! I know all you do! You think you can hide from me? That you can carry on your dirty, filthy schemes without me finding out?
ZACH: I'm really, really lost right now.
MRS. KIM: I heard about it! Kyon told me. She told me about your hands on
LANE. You put your hands on Lane! My Lane! And before God, I swear that you will be punished. Because that is what happens to all swine that walk up tall!
[She storms away, leaving Zach bewildered.]
[Doose's storage room.]
DEAN: Okay. So, we have today for your dining pleasure a choice of sandwiches. All fairly fresh, though slightly dented so as to afford me the eighty percent employee discount that Taylor throws in with the paycheck.
RORY: He's a heck of a humanitarian, that Taylor.
DEAN: Ah, we have a battered chicken salad, a bruised tuna salad, a ham that survived the creamed corn as*ault of 2004, and something grey.
RORY: Toss that.
DEAN: Gotcha.
RORY: Well, this is a very nice spread you've assembled here.
DEAN: Well, when you're dating an Ivy League girl, you have to pull out all the stops. Chip pieces? [offers her a bag]
RORY: Yes, please.
DEAN: I'm glad we got to do this today.
RORY: Me too.
DEAN: We haven't been able to see each other much lately.
RORY: Well, we're here now, right?
DEAN: Yeah. Right.
RORY: Hey, did you ever read my story?
DEAN: Which story?
RORY: The one about the Life and Death Brigade.
DEAN [hesitates]: Uh, yeah, I did.
RORY: You like it?
DEAN: I did like it. I like everything you write.
RORY: Do you think I painted the picture interestingly enough? Because I tried to be objective, to a certain extent, but it is a feature piece, so I wanted to have some human spark, you know?
DEAN: I thought it was good.
RORY: Nothing specific, though?
DEAN: Hey, you're the writer. I can't critique these things. I just know that I read it and I was interested.
RORY: Well that's what counts. [pauses awkwardly.] Okay, so, let's talk about tonight.
DEAN: Let's talk about tonight.
RORY: Okay. I'm going over to my grandparent's at six. I figure I'll go in, make the rounds, say hello, eat a cheese puff, then you can meet me outside the house at eight-thirty and we can hit a movie in Hartford or something.
DEAN: I don't want you ducking out of your grandparent's party early if it's going to be a big thing.
RORY: Hey, don't you want to get together with me?
DEAN: You know I do.
RORY: Okay then. No more talk, it's settled. Eight-thirty, out front, I'll be the one in the party dress with the jeans and a purse. I'll have to take a pretty big purse, but desperate times call for desperate actions. Deal?
DEAN: Deal.
RORY: How long have we got?
DEAN: Uh, fourteen minutes till my lunch break's over.
RORY: Okay then. Cheers.
[Luke's apartment: Luke goes to open the door. Lorelai is wearing a french maid's apron.]
LORELAI: Bonjour.
LUKE: What's all this?
LORELAI: This is as close as you're going to get to me cleaning up tonight. Hi.
LUKE: Hi.
[They kiss.]
LORELAI: Man, something smells crazy good in here. Oh my God, what are you making?
LUKE: Lamb and artichoke stew, penne with pesto and potatoes, roasted garlic with rosemary focaccia, tomatoes stuffed with bread crumbs and goat cheese, and ricotta cheesecake with amaretto cookies to go with your coffee.
LORELAI: You're the perfect man.
LUKE: Thank you.
LORELAI: I used to think it was Kelsey Grammer, but it's not. It's you.
LUKE: Finally, I'm one-upping Grammer. You want some wine?
LORELAI: Yes, please. [digging through a bag she brought with her.] Okay, so I brought a little ambience [pulls out candlesticks] and a little Clooney.
LUKE: George?
LORELAI: Rosemary. Oh my God, this is so great. I mean, besides the fact that it's an evening of you, it's also the first Friday in many many moons that I'm not at my parent's house and that knowledge is giving me a really warm, fuzzy feeling right about now. Meaning that if, by some chance, your meal winds up sucking, I might not even notice.
LUKE: Excellent to know. [Hands her a glass of wine.] To the warm and fuzzies.
LORELAI: Perfect.
[a bell rings in the kitchen.]
LUKE: Oh, I'm down to the artichokes.
LORELAI: You know, it may have choked Artie, but it ain't going to choke me. Some Little Rascals humor there for ya.
LUKE: I know.
LORELAI: You know? You are the perfect man.
[Elder Gilmore's house. Servants are rushing about getting things ready for the party.]
EMILY: Just move them so people can navigate around them comfortably. Not that far apart, not that far apart! Good Lord, if someone needs that much room to get around a chair they shouldn't be at a party, they should be on a treadmill.
RORY: Hey, Grandma.
EMILY: Rory! Oh, look at you! Will you look at her? [yells at a servant] I said look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
SERVANT: Yes, very beautiful.
EMILY: I love this dress, very elegant!
RORY: Thanks, Grandma. The place looks wonderful!
EMILY: Oh, there's too much blue.
RORY: It's Yale alumni, there can't be too much blue.
RICHARD: Emily, I noticed the bartenders weren't planning on using proper martini glasses. [Sees Rory.] Well, Rory, how lovely you look tonight.
EMILY: Doesn't she? This dress is divine. But you know what? My hairdresser's upstairs in my bedroom right now, why don't you go on up and have here do a little something with your hair?
RORY: My hair?
EMILY: Just for kicks. Come on, I'll take you up. Richard, could you -
RICHARD: I have it all under control.
EMILY: Thank you. Come on!
[Lane's apartment. Zach is pacing back and forth as she enters.]
LANE: Oh, you're home. Do you want to talk about dinner?
ZACH: Um, sure, or about how your mom totally attacked me today.
LANE: What?
ZACH: I'm standing out on the street in broad daylight, and, like, out of nowhere, bam! She was in my face, crazy and screaming!
LANE: Zach! Slow down, I don't understand.
[She makes him sit.]
ZACH: She cursed me, Lane! What's not to understand? She went on and on about burning in hellfire and swimming in Satan's sludge, and hell-dogs eating me, and I gotta tell you, it sounded bad.
LANE: I don't understand. Why would she?
ZACH: 'Cause she knows, okay? She knows everything! She sees everything, you know that.
LANE: She doesn't know everything, Zach.
ZACH: Well, she knows about you and me, and she's sending me to hell for it, and I've got to tell you this is not cool. This is not rock and roll.
LANE: I know, I'm sorry.
ZACH: I don't do parents. I'm not that guy. Nobody brings me home to Mom for a reason, okay? I'm a total backseat, in the closet, jump out the window dude, all the way.
LANE: I just don't understand how she found out. I mean, it's not like she's ever seen us together, or... I know who told her.
ZACH: I can't do this crazy scary short chick screaming at me on the street.
LANE: Zach, I'm sorry. I promise, it will never happen again! I will take care of it.
ZACH: What about the hellhounds?
LANE: I will take care of the hellhounds too.
ZACH: 'Cause Hellhounds is a cool band name but the positive imagery stops there.
LANE: I got it. It's done.
ZACH: Okay. Fine. I've gotta go walk by a church or something. [He leaves.]
[Luke's apartment.]
LORELAI [setting the table]: Hey, this is the same stuff from the diner.
LUKE: Yep.
LORELAI: Pilfering silverware from the diner!
LUKE: It's my diner.
LORELAI: Yes, but it's wrong. You should have boundaries in your life, leave work at work. You need a work life and a home life and the silverware is your work life. I'm so telling Dr. Phil on you.
[Luke laughs. A knock at the door.]
TJ's VOICE: Luke! You in there? Open up! Luke!
[Luke runs to the door and opens it.]
LUKE: What the -
TJ: You're home! Good!
LUKE [stammering]: Don't come in!
TJ: Your sister!
LUKE: TJ, this is really -
TJ: Do you know how many people told me not to get married? They said women make you crazy, they burrow in your head and you can't get them out! Women suck! Oh, hey, Lorelai.
LORELAI: How are you doing, TJ.
LUKE: I'm assuming you guys had a fight.
TJ: Not just a fight, a whammo monster of a fight. It was like Jake Lamotta and I was that blonde chick he was married to.
LUKE: You'll make up. Bye. [Tries to lead him out the door, TJ slams it shut.]
TJ: I mean you'd think I took a sh*t at the Pope, the way she talked to me. I'm sorry, I didn't hear her when she asked for the beer, and preset station numbers are there for a reason!
LUKE: Okay, look at the table and the candles, okay? This is not a good time.
TJ: You're telling me? I'm in escrow!
LUKE: Okay. Hold on. [To Lorelai] Go stir the sauce.
LORELAI: Me? But, I can't cook.
LUKE: It's not cooking, it's stirring.
LORELAI: No, I'm not good with big spoons, unless there's ice cream on the end - okay.
LUKE: TJ, what is this all about?
TJ: She's crazy, man, she goes nuts! And she yells at me like... there's a register that her voice reaches when she yells that only a freaking dog can hear, but her face is so twisted and contorted that you know she's hit that register, and it's amazing! It should be on the Discovery Channel or something.
LORELAI: Um, excuse me. How fast am I supposed to be stirring here?
LUKE: Just keep it from sticking. [To TJ] I am really sorry you had a fight, but you're married now. You can't run out every time you have a disagreement. Now, go on back.
TJ: I can't go back!
LUKE: TJ!
TJ: I'm not ready, it's all too fresh!
LORELAI: It's bubbling and turning brown.
LUKE: It's fine.
LORELAI: Well, what constitutes sticking?
LUKE: You can't ruin it.
LORELAI: I can, I have powers. Once the Barefoot Contessa was making a soufflé and when it fell, she looked out the TV and said, "Gilmore, was that you?"
LUKE: You've gotta go, man!
TJ: Just let me hang out here.
LUKE: No!
TJ: Just for a little while! Right in here, in the corner. Very quiet. You won't notice me at all. Churchmouse, buddy.
[Luke sighs and goes to the kitchen]
LORELAI: I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome.
LUKE: I got it.
[TJ whimpers and starts to sob in the corner.]
LUKE: He just needs a minute.
[Elder Gilmore house: Emily's bedroom. Rory is seated in front of a vanity.]
EMILY: Oh, yes, that's very nice. I love the lashes.
RORY: Grandma, this is really nice, but -
EMILY: Just a little more cheeks.
RORY: Shouldn't we be getting down to the party?
EMILY: Yes. One more minute now. [Opens her jewelry box] Let's see here, this might do it.
RORY: Grandma, I couldn't -
EMILY: Diamond necklaces were invented to be worn, they're doing nobody any good just sitting in a box. Perfect, do you like it?
RORY: Well, yes it's beautiful, but -
EMILY: It needs earrings! I agree!
RORY: No, it's fine on it's own, really!
EMILY: Your grandfather bought me these earrings on our first trip to Denmark. He swears he bought them off the ne'er-do-well brother of the king who stole them from the queen - have you ever heard such a thing?
RORY: No.
EMILY: Ah, I have a wonderful idea! Have you ever worn a tiara?
RORY: Well, when I was four...
EMILY: You look like a princess.
RORY: Grandma, are you sure you want me wearing all this stuff? They must be very expensive, and if something should happen -
EMILY: Nothing's going to happen, and yes. You look exactly the way I want my granddaughter to look to all our guests. Shall we?
RORY: Okay.
EMILY: It's going to be a wonderful evening.
[Coming down the stairs]
EMILY: Everyone, here's Rory!
[The room oohs and aahs.]
RICHARD: You look absolutely royal.
RORY: Well, it's probably the crown.
RICHARD: Emily, you did a fine job.
EMILY: Thank you, Richard.
RICHARD: Oh, uh, Rory, I'd like you to meet Min and Argus Head and their son Andrew. Andrew, this is my granddaughter Rory.
ANDREW: Nice to meet you.
RORY: Nice to meet you too.
RICHARD: Andrew will be at Yale Law next semester.
EMILY: Isn't that wonderful?
RORY: It is, especially if you want to be a lawyer.
[All laugh.]
EMILY: Well, we need to make the rounds. You two can talk more later.
RORY: It was nice to meet you.
ANDREW: You too.
EMILY: Rory, we'd like you to meet Deanna and Chase Anderson and their son Donnan.
DONNAN: It's a pleasure to meet you.
RORY: You too.
RICHARD: Donnan is going to run his father's shipping business one day.
EMILY: Our own Aristotle Onassis with infinitely better table manners.
DONNAN: Nothing's written in stone yet. We'll see what kind of pension plan the company has, and then -
[Polite laughter.]
EMILY: Rory's going to be a journalist. Take the world by storm, the two of you should talk later.
DONNAN: Definitely.
RORY: Okay, well -
RICHARD: Oh, Rory, Bunny and Napoleon Barnes and their son Kip.
KIP: Nice to meet you.
RORY: Oh, hi, Kip. It's nice to meet you.
EMILY: Kip is captain of the polo team.
RICHARD: Hell of a player. Give those Windsor boys a run for their money.
KIP: William and Harry are good guys. Decent horsemen, terrible bridge players.
RORY: Um, Kip, will you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to my grandparents. It was nice to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Barnes.
EMILY [to Kip]: Make sure you two talk later.
KIP: Yes, ma'am.
RICHARD: Yes, Rory?
EMILY: Are you enjoying the party?
RORY: The party is very nice, Grandma. I was just wondering, do your alumni friends have any daughters?
EMILY: Daughters? What do you mean?
RORY: Well, I was just noticing that there are a lot of boys here but not that many girls.
RICHARD: Really? I hadn't noticed. Did you notice, Emily?
EMILY: Why no, I haven't. Huh, well. I will have to pay more attention to the guest list next time, won't I, Richard?
RICHARD: Yes, you will.
EMILY: I promise you, we will throw another party just for our friends with girls. But in the meantime -
RICHARD: Ah, the Campbell boy is here.
EMILY: Oh, good, let's go. [To Rory] Campbell, like the soup!
[Luke's apartment.]
LORELAI: Oh my God, this is good. I mean this is seriously good.
LUKE: Glad you like it. [Camera angles so that we can see TJ sitting almost directly behind Luke.] How you doing, TJ?
TJ: I just need a minute.
LUKE: He said that thirty-five minutes ago.
LORELAI: Well, he's not crying now, so -
LUKE: I want him to leave.
LORELAI: I know. He will.
LUKE: Sure there's nothing I can do for you?
TJ: Just thirty seconds. That should do it.
LORELAI: Would you like something to eat, TJ?
LUKE: Why are you asking him if he wants something to eat?
LORELAI: He's been sitting there for half an hour, he might be hungry.
LUKE: He said thirty seconds. You're going to make the thirty seconds go longer.
LORELAI: TJ, we've got plenty.
TJ: That's very kind of you, Lorelai. I appreciate it. Being in escrow and everything. But I don't want to interrupt your evening. As soon as I gather myself I'll be going. Ten more minutes?
[Luke is struggling to keep his cool.]
LORELAI: Mmm.
[Elder Gilmore's party. Rory is in the middle of a group of guys looking extremely bored.]
YOUNG MAN #1: Look, you can go A.M.G. but you're still going stock Mercedes.
YOUNG MAN #2: Okay, are you seriously knocking 493 horses at 6100 rpm's coming out of a 5.5 litre, 24 valve V-8?
YOUNG MAN #1: Okay, well, let's say you go with the SL-55.
RORY: Um, I'm sorry. Would you all excuse me for just a -
YOUNG MAN #1: Yeah, sure. So the SL-55. Look, at least go aftermarket on its ass.
[Rory escapes into Richard's study. She sits down at the desk and picks up the phone.]



[Cuts between Luke's apartment and Richard's study.]
LORELAI: I told you.
RORY: You told me what?
LORELAI: Whatever has happened at that party you got rooked into tonight. I told you.
RORY: Do you want to hear or do you just want to gloat?
LORELAI: Well, I'm a multi-tasker.
RORY: So I get here, and Grandma immediately whisks me upstairs where her hairdresser and makeup artist are waiting to make a new me.
LORELAI: 'Cause the old you was so last season.
RORY: Then I come downstairs to find that the guests are all Yale friends of Grandma and Grandpa's and their sons.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: No girls! All boys, and me!
LORELAI: You're kidding.
RORY: Nope. I feel like I'm being auctioned off.
LORELAI: They suck, my parents suck.
RORY: This is a very silly picture.
LORELAI: They know you're with Dean, 'cause by the way you told them.
RORY: It's okay, I just thought you'd like to know.
LORELAI: Do you have a pencil?
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: 'Cause there are twelve ways out of that house that they don't know about. Write this down. First, the basement. It's a little dusty, but almost foolproof. If you can't get there, grab a screwdriver and jimmy the back of my mother's closet. There's a false back.
RORY: Mom -
LORELAI: And if they haven't trimmed the trees yet, the second guest bathroom window opens out onto the massive elm and you can shimmy right down.
RORY: I am not going to shimmy. I don't need to sneak out, it's fine. Dean is picking me up at eight thirty, I can manage till then.
LORELAI: They played you, kid.
RORY: Yeah, I know.
LORELAI: I hate that they did that.
RORY: Well, it's done. Okay, I should go. In this crowd they will definitely notice me missing. I'll see you later.
LORELAI: Bye, hun.
LUKE: What's the matter?
LORELAI: Nothing a little patricide won't solve.
[A phone rings in the Elder Gilmore's kitchen. A maid picks up and answers in Spanish.]
LORELAI: Oh, hello, I'd like to speak to Richard or Emily.
MAID: Que?
LORELAI: I'd like to speak to Richard and Emily Gilmore.
MAID: No comprendo. [more Spanish.]
LORELAI: Is there someone there who speaks English? I hear English in the background. [Knock at Luke's door. Luke gets up to answer it.] Oh, right there! I heard the word salmon. Could you pass the phone to the person who said "salmon"? Uh-huh.
[At the door.]
LIZ: Is he here?
LUKE: Yes. Get him out, please!
LORELAI: Emily Gilmore. Senora Emily Gilmore?
LIZ: TJ, come on, let's go.
TJ: I cannot deal with you right now.
LIZ: You can't just barge in here like this.
TJ [insulted]: I did not barge! Do not accuse me of barging!
LIZ: You are ruining their evening!
TJ: No, I am not! I'm just sitting here, I'm not saying anything!
LUKE: Okay, you two just go downstairs and talk! Please!
LIZ: You are unbelievable, you know that?
TJ: I do, as a matter of fact.
LIZ: I hadn't even come out of the bedroom and you'd gone!
TJ: I wasn't gonna stick around so you could yell at me!
LUKE: Okay! This is enough! The both of you just have to shut up right now, I've got neighbors!
LIZ: You don't even have your shoes on!
TJ: I've got shoes on!
LIZ: You've got my shoes on!
TJ: Oh, so I guess all that "what's mine is yours" was just a bunch of crap also! [He takes off the shoes and hands them to Luke.]
LIZ: You know what? I am fed up with you and the drama, I can't take it! My head's going to explode from all your freaking scenes and your tantrums!
TJ: My tantrums?
LIZ: I cannot look at you. [She locks herself in the bathroom.]
LUKE: Liz, what are you - [To TJ] Go get her out of there!
TJ: Nope, that's exactly what she wants!
LORELAI: Okay, never mind. I'll call back. Bye.
LUKE: TJ!
TJ: Damn. I had almost gotten myself together. Now I have to start all over! [Starts crying.]
LUKE [to Lorelai]: She's in the bathroom.
LORELAI: Okay. You go try to calm him down and I'll go see if I can talk to her.
LUKE: You were right. Having family near is fun!
[Elder Gilmore's patio.]
JORDAN: Rory?
RORY: Mm-hm?
JORDAN: I'm Jordan. Your grandmother sent me over here. Apparently we're made for each other.
RORY: Oh, gee. Well, how convenient.
JORDAN: There's nothing like having your family play matchmaker. How old are you?
RORY: Me? I'm, um, almost twenty.
JORDAN: All right, good. Just making sure everything's legal. You need a drink?
RORY: No, not a drink.
JORDAN: Why? Get a little crazy when you drink?
RORY: Yes. That's it.
JORDAN: I'd like to see that.
LOGAN: Rory. There you are, I've been looking everywhere for you. [He puts his arm around her.] I'm late, I'm sorry, don't be mad. Logan Huntzberger.
JORDAN: Uh, Jordan Chase.
LOGAN: Good to meet you, thanks for keeping my girl busy. If you hadn't, she would've noticed exactly how late I am and then she mighta left and that would have been very, very bad.
JORDAN: Excuse me, I'm sorry - you're with her?
LOGAN: Going on a year and a half.
JORDAN: Great. What the hell am I doing here? [He walks away.]
RORY: Oh, thank you.
LOGAN: You looked cornered.
RORY: I was.
LOGAN: Well, glad to be of service. Man, I hate these parties.
RORY: Not really my bag either.
LOGAN: But at least the bar is stocked, and I must say your grandmother has excellent food.
RORY: Wait, my grandmother?
[Richard comes up behind them.]
RICHARD: Logan? How are you, son?
LOGAN: I'm very well, sir, and yourself?
RICHARD: Oh, I'm fit as a fiddle! It's good to see you. Are your parents here?
LOGAN: Wandering around here somewhere. Mom is obsessed with Emily's new draperies.
RICHARD: Ah, yes. Emily has exquisite taste in fabrics. All right, Rory. Since I see that you are in capable hands I will make another round and end up at the bar.
LOGAN: It's been good to see you, Richard.
RICHARD: Good to see you, Logan. [He moves away.]
RORY: You know my grandparents.
LOGAN: My folks are good friends with Richard and Emily. Okay, so. Lesson One in coping with painfully boring parties, form a sub-party.
RORY: Where are you going?
LOGAN: Finn!
RORY: Finn's here?
LOGAN: Finn!
[Finn comes out on the patio.]
FINN: You rang?
LOGAN: Time for a change of venue.
FINN: Oh, fantastic. [To Rory] Do I know you?
[Mrs. Kim's home: front porch, Lane knocks. Kyon answers.]
LANE: Is my mother here?
KYON: No, she's at Mrs. Cho's house. Mrs. Cho thinks that she lost some weight, and Mrs. Kim went to give it back to her.
LANE: Good. Why did you rat me out to my mother?
KYON: Rat you out?
LANE: You told her about Zach.
KYON: The boy you hugged?
LANE: Yes! You told her, I'm just a little mystified as to why you would do that.
KYON: Mrs. Kim has taken me in.
LANE: No, I took you in. You came to me, starving, and I gave you fries. You did like the fries, right?
KYON: Very, very much.
LANE: Okay, so that is we what we call in America a bonding thing. I gave you the fries and you are not supposed to tell on me to my mother!
KYON: What am I supposed to do?
LANE: Nothing. You say nothing, you do nothing.
KYON: But she would know!
LANE: She would know what?
KYON: She would know I lied, she would know I'm ungrateful and I keep a secret from her!
LANE: How would she know?
KYON: She know!
LANE: No, she no know! She is not magic!
KYON: Yes she is! She read thoughts and hand gestures!
LANE: Come here. [She makes Kyon sit down.] If you want, I can help you.
KYON: Help me?
LANE: What do you do every Sunday between noon and four?
KYON: I study.
LANE: And then?
KYON: And then I wait for Mrs. Kim to get home from her Crochet for Christ group with her sister.
LANE: Okay. And what do you do while you're waiting?
KYON: Nothing. I sit quietly.
LANE: Okay. Now wouldn't you rather, let's say, watch some television while you're waiting for my mother to get home?
KYON [shaking her head]: Oh, I cannot!
LANE: Why?
KYON: Mrs. Kim does not want me to watch the television!
LANE: And how would she know?
KYON: Because, there's a little machine in the television set that will tell her what I watch!
LANE: Ha!
KYON: What ha?
LANE: That machine does not exist.
KYON: It does not?
LANE: Nope. It took me fifteen years to figure it out, but that's the truth.
KYON: So she cannot know?
LANE: She also cannot smell fast food on you even after you've showered.
KYON: She can't?
LANE: And she can't tell how many times you've opened your bible by staring at your palm.
KYON: My head spins!
LANE: And you don't have to hand out all those religious flyers she gives you. Just post enough of them around here regular route home and she'll think the job is done.
KYON: I think I need to lie down.
LANE: It's a whole new world, Kyon. A world I fought long and hard to figure out and I'm willing to pass all my knowledge on to you.
KYON: So, I can eat fries, watch TV if I get home early from not giving out my flyers?
LANE: I wouldn't bring the fries into the house. She has a really good nose. But you're thinking big, and I respect that.
KYON: I can watch the TV!
LANE: Stick with me, kid, and I'll have you wearing lip gloss within a month.
[Luke's apartment. Liz and TJ are still fighting in the bathroom, and
LORELAI is still on the phone.]
LORELAI: Emily and Richard Gilmore! Oh, come on! I know you speak English. I heard you yell "salmon" earlier. My mother put you up to this. Fine. [Hangs up.]
LUKE: What are they doing in there?
LORELAI: Um, fighting?
LUKE: And how long can you fight in an eight by ten room?
LORELAI: Well, maybe they're not fighting. Maybe they're having angry make-up sex.
LUKE: Now that makes me feel much better, thank you. Sorry about dinner.
LORELAI: Aw, dinner was great. It was delicious and interactive -
LUKE: Okay, I don't know how long this is going to continue.
LORELAI: Well, we could set fire to the place. Smoke 'em out.
LUKE: Listen, you don't have to sit here. I'll deal with this. You go home.
LORELAI: Are you sure?
LUKE: Yep. They are my family. Yippee. I'll deal with it. [Puts the cheesecake in a container.] You take this and go home, and we will try again tomorrow.
LORELAI: Wow! My own cheesecake. No man's ever given me a whole cheesecake before.
LUKE: You remember that.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Hey, maybe when I get home I'll stir something, seeing as I'm so good at it. Thanks for dinner.
[They share a steamy kiss.]
LUKE: Thank you for not being related to me.
[Lorelai snickers.]
LUKE: That came out wrong.
LORELAI: No, I got it. Goodnight.
LUKE: 'Night.
[She leaves.]
[Elder Gilmore pool house.]
COLIN: Gilmore, your grandfather has apalling taste in Scotch.
RORY: I think you should go on inside and tell him!
COLIN: If he hasn't learned by now I certainly can't teach him.
LOGAN: Colin, make sure you refill that bottle with something, we don't want Ace over here to get busted.
COLIN: I know. I know.
LOGAN [To Rory]: Refill?
RORY: Sure, why not?
FINN: Because drinking is bad. It's very, very bad and we're bad for doing it. Spank me.
RORY: I think the hangover tomorrow will be punishment enough.
FINN: She hasn't had enough champagne, Logan. [He leaves.]
LOGAN: Hey, listen, I forgot to tell you, I read the article.
RORY: You did?
LOGAN: Yep, not bad.
RORY: Thank you.
LOGAN: Caught the spirit of the thing, I'll give you that.
RORY: But?
LOGAN: No, no buts. You've got a good style. There were a few too many similes in it for my taste, but it definitely had a Joseph Mitchell thing going for it, I like that.
RORY: I'm surprised you even bothered to read it.
LOGAN: Are you? Hmm. [Stands up] So, who's it going to be?
RORY: What?
LOGAN: Well, this shindig's an obvious meat market, I've got the feeling that your grandparents are expecting you to choose someone tonight, so...
RORY: Oh, well...
FINN: Me. Pick me.
CROWD OF GUYS: No, pick me!
FINN: But I'm exotic!
COLIN: So's the Asian Bird flu.
LOGAN: Wow. A room full of guys and still extremely slim pickings.
RORY: Well, I don't know. It's a tough choice, maybe I should let my boyfriend help me choose.
LOGAN: You have a boyfriend?
FINN: I'm crushed.
GUY: Ain't it always the way?
LOGAN: Do Richard and Emily know about this?
RORY: Yeah, they do.
LOGAN: They're just trying to make sure you got a backup?
RORY: No, they're just - oh no, what time is it?
FINN: It's crying time.
COLIN: Eight forty five.
RORY: Dean is meeting me at eight-thirty! [She gets up to go.]
LOGAN: Where?
RORY: Here, out front!
LOGAN: Dean, is this the boyfriend?
RORY: Yes, the boyfriend!
LOGAN: Well, we got to see this guy.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: See who the man is who's won your heart. Got to make sure he's good enough. Let's go, boys!
RORY: But - hey!
LOGAN: Coming?
[Exterior Front door. Dean is waiting and looks up as Rory and the group of guys come out the door.]
RORY: Dean, hi. I'm sorry, have you been waiting long? I didn't have a watch and we were in the pool house. These are some friends. They go to Yale with me and they know my grandparents. The party was so boring so we - [She stops as Dean looks very angry.] Is that a new shirt? 'Cause I like it.
DEAN: What am I doing here, Rory?
RORY: You're picking me up.
DEAN: I don't belong here. Not anymore. [He pauses, Rory doesn't deny it.] Do I?
RORY: Dean.
DEAN: You look good.
[He drives away, Rory starts to cry. The guys come over to her.]
LOGAN [gently]: You'll be okay.
RORY [shakes her head]: No, I won't.
LOGAN: Okay, that's it. Back to the pool house, men. We have some serious bucking up to do here.
COLIN: I swiped some Scotch.
FINN: I'll reenact the Passion of the Christ.
[The boys cheer and head inside.]
LOGAN: Hey Ace, nothing ever seems quite as bad after Finn's Passion of the Christ. Except Finn's Passion of the Christ.
[He puts her arm around her. They go inside.]
[Lorelai's house. She dials the phone.]
MAID: Gilmore residence.
LORELAI: Hello! Oh, you speak English! Thank God! Um, is Emily Gilmore there, please?
MAID: It's for you, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Hello?
LORELAI: Hi, Mom, it's me.
EMILY: Well, hello, Lorelai. How are you?
LORELAI: I'm fine. Can I talk to you and Dad for a minute?
RICHARD: Your father's paying the caterers.
LORELAI: Well this'll just take a minute. Could you maybe go in the study on the speakerphone? Seriously, just one minute?
EMILY: All right. Hold on. [a minute.] All right, we're both here.
RICHARD: Hello, Lorelai. What can we do for you?
LORELAI: I just wanted to touch base with you about this little party you threw for Rory tonight.
EMILY: The party was not for Rory, it was for our Yale alumni.
LORELAI: Oh, it was not. It was a trick and you know it and I know it so let's just know it together.
RICHARD: What do you want, Lorelai?
LORELAI: You lied to your granddaughter tonight. You lied to a kid who trusted you. You tricked her.
EMILY: It was a party!
LORELAI: It was a mating ritual!
RICHARD: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: All boys, Mom? Seriously? What is that all about?
EMILY: It's good for her to interact with her peers.
RICHARD: Lorelai, Rory is in a new phase of her life now, and she needs to be exposed to different things, different people. That's all we were trying to do.
LORELAI: She has a boyfriend!
EMILY: Oh, so what?
LORELAI: So, she has a boyfriend, which means she doesn't need another one!
RICHARD: She's twenty years old, Lorelai. She's not going to be with that boy forever.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
EMILY: That's right. And when she's ready to move on, she will have met some nice young men who will represent the new phase in her life.
RICHARD: I'm sure that Dean is a very nice young man. But he is certainly not good enough for Rory!
EMILY: That's right!
RICHARD: Now she is young. But young people need guidance. And since you seem so little help in this department, we had to step in.
LORELAI: Well, step on out again, because this is none of your business!
EMILY: Lorelai, I am tired. And the caterers have caked the floor with something sticky and I don't have time for this. We want more for her, period. Now obviously it is too late for you but it is not too late for Rory, and we are going to make sure that she has the life she deserves!
LORELAI: You know, it doesn't matter what you think of me, okay? Rory will choose her own path in life and there's nothing either one of you can do about it.
EMILY: I'm hanging up.
LORELAI: Well, me too.
[They hang up. Lorelai sees headlights as a car pulls up. The door opens,
RORY shrieks as she is getting out of a limo with the rowdy group of guys. She seems to be having a blast. Rory stumbles up the walk.]
LOGAN: Whoa, Ace, you need some help there?
RORY: Bye!
[Lorelai, sad, stops watching.]

OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW – SIDEWALK OUTSIDE DOOSE'S MARKET
[Lorelai appears around the corner and prepares to enter the grocery store.]
JACKSON: [loud whisper OS] Psst! Lorelai.
LORELAI: Jackson.
[She spots him hiding on the side of the building. He's curiously dressed in a thick coat and a concealing lumberjack hat – flaps arranged to hide his face. She is intrigued and approaches him.]
JACKSON: [stage whisper] Shh. Just come here a second. I need you to get some stuff for me from Doose's.
LORELAI: Jackson, what are you doing?
JACKSON: [continues speaking quietly] Stop saying my name. Look, Sookie's got major food cravings, and I can't go in to "Leech Headquarters". They'll be all over me in two seconds flat.
LORELAI: [sympathetic] Selectman job isn't getting any easier, huh?
JACKSON: No, it's getting worse. Like last week -- Ann Benninghoff comes to me, right? She wants to put a sales cart outside the colonial museum selling revolutionary w*r books and "just a few arrowheads." Fine, but then Sally Lannigan hears about that, and she wants to sell her pine-needle sachets out in front of the gazebo. Fine, but then Kirk comes to me in an outrage because he's allergic to all pine-scented things, and how could I not know this? And pretty soon, I'm nothing but an empty suit of Jackson skin.
LORELAI: Ew. Well, what do you need?
[Jackson pulls a rumpled piece of paper from his coat pocket and unfolds it.]
JACKSON: Oh, thanks. Uh...let's see here. Grapefruit juice, Milk Duds, bloody mary mix, extra-spicy turkey sausage -- this is all going in the same blender, by the way –
LORELAI: Good Lordy.
JACKSON: Chives -- I'm getting a stomachache just reading this list.
LORELAI: Give it to me. I'll brave headquarters for you.
JACKSON: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[Lorelai pauses and smiles expectantly.]
JACKSON: [ Sighs ] Do not go where you're going.
LORELAI: Well, what's one leech versus a swarm?
JACKSON: [looks to the skies and whimpers] I have no sanctuary.
LORELAI: The pothole on the road to the Dragonfly is getting worse. Kids are starting to swim in it.
JACKSON: I'll put it on the list, along with everything else.
LORELAI: Top of the list, please? [louder] Jackson!
JACKSON: Don't. Shh.
LORELAI: [feigned innocence] Was that too loud? Can't always tell.
JACKSON: It's on top of the list.
LORELAI: [grins] Be back in a flash.
[She exits into the store as another pedestrian walks by. Paranoid, Jackson quickly turns away, tries to look casual.]
CUT TO SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE – INTERIOR - FRONT DOOR
[Jackson enters the house with Lorelai following, both laden with grocery bags.]
JACKSON: Sookie, I'm home.
LORELAI: I'm home, too!
JACKSON: Were we followed? [peers around edge of curtain]
LORELAI: I don't think so. Good thing we ditched that Audi in Marseilles. Now we just have to find that tracking device. [hears crying from next room] Sookie, honey, what's wrong?
SOOKIE: [ Crying ] I just -- it's just -- it's just so sad.
[Jackson and Lorelai join Sookie in the living room]
LORELAI: Oh! People Magazine. Jackson, you know we don't allow soft human-interest stories around Sookie when she's pregnant.
JACKSON: She must have snuck it in.
SOOKIE: [whimpering] I feel like they were perfect for each other, you know?
LORELAI: [sympathetic] Uh-huh. Who, honey?
SOOKIE: [hiccupping stutters] The two of them. I mean, with the hair and the teeth and the -- you know?
LORELAI: Who's got hair and teeth?
SOOKIE: And then the Divine Brown thing happens, and bammo -- their love's in the toilet.
LORELAI: We're talking Elizabeth Hurley and Hugh Grant?
JACKSON: She must have found an old one somewhere.
LORELAI: [encouragingly] That was years ago, Sookie.
JACKSON: Tons of people have broken up since then.
SOOKIE: [horrified] and Oh, my God!
LORELAI: No, no, it's okay. Everyone's together and happy. Dispose, please.
JACKSON: Gladly. [exits with the magazine]
SOOKIE: Oh, is that my food?
LORELAI: Yes, yes, look. We got, uh, turkey sausage -- extra-spicy like you wanted.
SOOKIE: Yuk.
LORELAI: And grapefruit juice.
SOOKIE: Ugh.
LORELAI: Rappini.
SOOKIE: Ugh. Puke.
LORELAI: You're not craving things anymore, are you?
SOOKIE: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: No.
[Jackson returns to join his wife – sits on the arm of the sofa to comfort her]
SOOKIE: Oh, I mean, I'm so friggin impossible. You're so good to me, and you go to all this trouble, and you get me everything I want, then I don't want it anymore. [Lorelai smiles warmly at her friend] I'm sorry that you have to be in love with a crazy person.
JACKSON: Come here. [Sookie leans into his embrace] I'll tell you what -- I'll deal with as much moodiness and food weirdness as you can dish out as long as you do the actual "squeezing a human being out of your body" part.
SOOKIE: [chuckles] Deal.
[Jackson's gaze wanders out the front window. He stands suddenly, causing Sookie to grunt as she leans into nothing. ]
JACKSON: Okay. That car just slowed down as it went past the house.
LORELAI: Jackson, why don't you get away from the window and go relax or something?
JACKSON: Oh, I shouldn't be near a window.
SOOKIE: Why don't you take it easy, sweetie, and go check on Davey?
JACKSON: All right, but if anyone calls for me, I'm not here... and I'm armed and dangerous. [exits again]
LORELAI: [warm tone] He lo-o-o-ves you.
SOOKIE: Then he's certifiable... because I'm certifiable, and you have to be certifiable to put up with that.
LORELAI: Hey, you're pregnant. You're not supposed to be normal. [stands and walks to the kitchen to put away groceries]
SOOKIE: [Chuckles] I guess so. And it may be mean, but when I worry too much about how I'm treating Jackson, I just remember Brandy.
[Sookie stands and follows Lorelai to the kitchen and sits at the table]
LORELAI: Brandy?
SOOKIE: Christopher's Brandy.
LORELAI: Christopher's Sherry?
SOOKIE: Oh. [Chuckles] I knew it was something like that. Anyway, I'm handling this all better than her. How is he, anyway?
LORELAI: Christopher? Fine. [pause] Wow, you know what? I have no idea. He never called me again.
SOOKIE: Really?
[Lorelai joins Sookie seated at the table]
LORELAI: Not once since I went over there. I assume he's doing fine, but I don't know.
SOOKIE: He never called? All those problems with the baby were solved in one night?
LORELAI: Kind of weird, isn't it?
SOOKIE: A little.
LORELAI: You never know with him. He's as unpredictable as a pregnant woman. No offense.
SOOKIE: [Chuckles] None taken.
LORELAI: I hope he and G.G. are okay. The last time I was over there, he was duct-taping her diapers, but... I'm sure he's found the tabby thingies by now. Yeah, I'm sure he's okay.
SOOKIE: Milk chocolate and artichoke hearts.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: That's what I want, and I'm not going to change my mind. Milk chocolate and... bell peppers! [excitedly hops to her feet]
LORELAI: Ah.
SOOKIE: Now I'm not going to change my mind. Jackson, I figured it out! Milk -- dark chocolate. Ooh, taffy! Taffy and walnuts. [Gasps] Taffy -- OOH, pistachios! Ooh, hearts of palm! [ she walks out of the room ]
CUT TO RORY'S YALE DORM – COMMON ROOM
[Rory seated on sofa, reading a newspaper. Paris paces nervously, then leans over Rory's shoulder]
RORY: Paris, please don't compare our reading speeds again. You're fast, I'm slow. Enjoy your trophy.
PARIS: I need the exact time of today's sunset.
RORY: I'm in the middle of an article.
PARIS: Well, if you read faster, you wouldn't be.
[Rory turns the newspaper page]
RORY: Okay, the time of today's sunset is 4:31.
PARIS: Okay. Then I just have to keep my mind occupied until 4:31.
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: What?
RORY: Tell me again why you're fasting for Ramadan.
PARIS: Look, Rory, if you want to crib your articles from the A.P. Wire, that's your business. I, on the other hand, actually give a rat's ass about journalistic integrity. When I write about Ramadan, I experience Ramadan. Are you chewing gum?
RORY: What? Yes. Why?
PARIS: I'd really prefer it if you didn't chew it at me.
RORY: Paris, did you know that not eating can make people kind of snippy?
PARIS: Ramadan is about a lot more than just not eating. It calls for a total abstinence from food particles passing through the mouth or nose. Your bazooka is passing through my nose.
[ Knock on door ]
RORY: It's unlocked. [Marty walks in carrying a paper sack] Hey, Marty.
MARTY: So, I just bartended this crazy brunch with chocolate fountains and floating ice sculptures, and I snagged us all kinds of hors d'oeuvres. [indicating the two bags he's carrying]
PARIS: [sarcasm] Oh, nice going, bucko.
MARTY: [eyes Paris timidly] Okay, so, she didn't really mean "nice going," right? 'Cause there's sort of a devil-eye thing going on.
RORY: She's fasting.
PARIS: People came to America to escape religious persecution.
[Cell phone rings – Rory stands and retrieves her cell phone. Marty takes her vacant seat on the sofa.]
MARTY: Well, what religion is anti-leftovers? [eyes Paris warily]
RORY: Hello.
LORELAI: Hi. Guess where I am?
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Go on, guess.
RORY: Oh, I don't know, Luke's?
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW – LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai is standing behind Luke's counter as employees bustle around her.]
LORELAI: But not just at Luke's -- on the phone at Luke's, and it's all perfectly legal because I'm on the diner's phone.
RORY: A loophole. Nice.
LORELAI: You got to love a loophole.
[The scene switches between the diner and Rory's dorm]
RORY: Getting to use Luke's behind-the-counter phone, that's like getting to wear his letterman jacket.
LORELAI: I know. Maybe now he'll ask me to the sock hop.
RORY: I'm glad you guys are all loopholey and sock-hoppy. It's nice.
LORELAI: Yeah. Well, um, I just called to, you know, uh, brag about my loophole and check on plans for Friday night dinner.
[Luke emerges from the back storeroom carrying supplies and shouts. ]
LUKE: Hey!
LORELAI: Hon, hold on a sec.
[Luke walks up]
LUKE: What are you doing back here?
RORY: You didn't have permission to be behind the counter, did you?
LORELAI: You don't need permission if you're the girlfriend.
LUKE: [lectures] A sack of potatoes falls on your head, the insurance company doesn't care if you're the girlfriend.
LORELAI: Well, you're storing potatoes in a very weird place if you're worried about them falling on people's heads.
LUKE: [scolds and shoo's] Go. Go. Get.
LORELAI: Okay, I'm getting.
[She pulls the phone cord with her while walking around to the front of the counter returning to her stool. A semi-eaten bowl of pie and ice cream sits before her.]
RORY: He's kicking you out?
LORELAI: No. It's just my boyfriend's so protective of my safety, the thought of food falling on my head makes him crazy. So, anyway, what's better for you -- carpool or meet there?
RORY: Meet's better, I guess.
LORELAI: Okay, honey, I'll see you there.
RORY: Oh, wait -- there's something I want to run by you.
[At the dorm, Marty peeks inside one of his paper bags. Paris alternately fans the air and hits Marty with the newspaper]
MARTY: Can't you just plug your nose or something?
PARIS: Sure, ask a billion Muslims to plug their noses. That makes a lot of sense, Marty.
[She continues to b*at him with the paper until he closes the bag and leans back, defeated. Rory exits to her room.]
CUT TO RORY'S DORM - BEDROOM
[Rory enters and closes the door to avoid the noisy ruckus between Paris and Marty. Scene continues to switch between bedroom to Luke's Diner]
RORY: Okay, so, I've got an idea.
LORELAI: Finally this Yale thing's kicking in.
RORY: I am sick of humoring Grandma and Grandpa during this stupid separation of theirs. This "drinks here, dinner there" is dumb. It's not working, and we should not do it anymore.
LORELAI: Well, if you feel it is best to end the Friday night dinners, then as your mother, I feel it is my duty to support you.
RORY: I'm not saying we should end Friday night dinners.
LORELAI: Okay, well, then, as your mother, I feel it is my duty to tell you you're wrong.
RORY: We need to take a stand. No more humoring. We need to get them in a room and talk some sense into them, and to do that, I think we should divide and conquer. So this Friday, I'll have dinner with one, and you'll have dinner with the other.
LORELAI: Uh-huh. Hey, what happened to the idea of ending Friday night dinners? - Because I thought that one had real potential.
[Loud muffled voices continue from the other room]
RORY: This way, we can each talk to them one-on-one, break them down, convince them that their separation isn't okay with us.
LORELAI: It's not?
RORY: Mom, I know they both want to be with each other.
LORELAI: Hon, my parents are very stubborn. I don't want you to get your hopes up about the outcome.
RORY: But I can't stand it the way it is. I think they both miss each other, but they're just too proud, and it's just -- it's kind of breaking my heart.
LORELAI: So...which one do you want me to take?
RORY: How about I'll take grandpa, and you'll take grandma?
LORELAI: Ahh, no!
RORY: Okay, then I'll take grandma, and you take grandpa.
LORELAI: Ahh, no!
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Can't I take the butler? He doesn't talk much, and as far as I can tell, thoroughly enjoys the way I dress.
[Marty enters Rory's room and closes door behind him]
MARTY: She's throwing things at me. Religious sanctuary, please.
RORY: [to her mother] The butler is not an option.
LORELAI: Fine, I'll take her.
RORY: Thank you. Bye. [clicks off phone. Marty joins her on the edge of the bed. He hands her a paper bag.] Ooh. What's the bacon wrapped around?
MARTY: Something bacon should never be wrapped around.
RORY: Rich people.
MARTY: They live very different lives.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai still sits at the counter. Luke walks up from the other side and clears away Lorelai's bowl and hands it to passing employee. He pulls out his usual tablet and pencil. He talks while he checks numbers.]
LORELAI: Thanks.
LUKE: So, that was Rory?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: How's she doing?
LORELAI: Fine.
LUKE: With the Dean thing and all, the breakup?
LORELAI: She sounds okay. Actually, she's petite, but she's strong.
LUKE: Good. I'm glad.
LORELAI: Don't gloat.
LUKE: I'm not gloating.
LORELAI: Yes, you are.
LUKE: I just said I'm glad she's okay. That's not gloating.
LORELAI: It was your tone, like you were covering up for being gloaty by sounding extra non-gloaty.
LUKE: Lorelai.
LORELAI: You always hated him. I get it.
LUKE: I never hated him. I just never thought he was right for Rory, and I swear, I'm not gloating.
LORELAI: Well, I don't know. If it walks like a gloat and quacks like a gloat --
LUKE: I wasn't.
LORELAI: I got to go. Kiss. [leans forward and Luke meets her half-way over the counter. They kiss]
[T.J. enters the diner and walks up. He has a towel thrown over one shoulder.]
T.J.: I stink. There's your headline. Keep your distance.
LUKE: [to Lorelai] You better run.
LORELAI: I'll call you later. [gathers her jacket and purse and stands]
LUKE: If I don't strangle myself with the phone cord, I'll answer. [returns to his paperwork]
LORELAI: Hi, T.J.
T.J.: Three feet, Lorelai, 'cause I haven't showered in as many days.
LORELAI: Uh-oh. Goodbye, T.J. [scoots around him carefully and exits]
T.J.: [to Luke] I need your shower, buddy.
[Luke doesn't look up]
LUKE: Sorry. Broken.
T.J.: Really? 'Cause you're looking powder fresh.
LUKE: I am not powder fresh.
T.J.: Come on, Luke, we got no water at our new place, and the flies, they are a-buzzing. [waves his hand] Man!
LUKE: Fine, use my shower, T.J. [points to the direction of the stairs]
T.J.: You're the best, you know that? I worship you.
LUKE: Yeah, you should build an altar to me. You know, I know I shouldn't ask you this, but why isn't your water turned on?
T.J.: 'Cause the pipes got trashed after I demo'd the upstairs bathroom.
LUKE: You weren't going to demo the bathrooms.
T.J.: But I had a little accident installing the towel rack, and the next thing you know, the whole bathroom's demo'd.
LUKE: Because of the towel rack?
T.J.: I got very angry at this towel rack.
LUKE: Yes, that's very normal.
T.J.: But I got some replacement pipe. I just got to cut it up into shorter pieces and stick it together, and we're good to go.
LUKE: Okay, sounds like you know what you're doing.
T.J.: I just need some kind of tool that cuts pipe. What would you call that?
LUKE: [sarcastic] I don't know, a pipe cutter?
T.J.: That's it! A pipe cutter! You know anyone who's got a pipe cutter?
LUKE: I have a pipe cutter. Would you like to borrow it?
T.J.: That cuts pipe, right?
LUKE: Hey, T.J., Why don't you just hire a professional?
T.J.: Because I'm trying to be responsible. What with the move and being in escrow and everything, I'm not exactly flush, so I figured I'd do it myself. [uses the "pity me" face] Is that so – wrong?
LUKE: [fatalistic] I'll help you cut the pipe, T.J.
T.J.: [mood immediately brightens] Oh, hey, that's beyond the call. You've got to be the best brother-in-law in the world.
LUKE: Uh-huh. Thanks. Anything else?
T.J.: You know, it's real hell trying to make coffee without water.
LUKE: Have some coffee, T.J.
[T.J. helps himself to a donut under the serving lid]
T.J.: And a cruller to cut the bitterness 'cause sometimes -- no offense -- I find your coffee a little bitter. I mean, it's good. It's just a little bitter.
CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN – FRONT DESK
[Lorelai is typing on the computer. Michel walks up as a guest departs.]
MICHEL: We need to talk.
LORELAI: sh**t.
MICHEL: There's a couple here I thought I recognized, but I was not sure, so I consulted an old guest ledger from the Independence Inn and found a physical description that confirmed their identities.
LORELAI: Physical description?
MICHEL: Yes. I had described them with astonishing accuracy, down to the crooked eyes and unsightly moles.
LORELAI: You have a system of describing what people's moles look like?
MICHEL: Mm-hmm. Moles, freckles. What is their weight? Are they buxom? Is their chin cleft? Do they walk with any sort of limp? But this is beside the point. You remember the bathrobe bandits?
LORELAI: [feigns a gasps then returns deadpan] No.
MICHEL: The married couple from Massachusetts that stole bathrobes from the Independence Inn every time they came. We call them the bathrobe bandits. They are here.
LORELAI: Did they bring their moles?
MICHEL: With your permission, I'm going to remove their bathrobes from their room as a preventative measure.
LORELAI: No, no, Michel, come on. If they steal robes, we just charge their credit card.
MICHEL: And if they take a credenza or a couch -- do you think they'll stop at robes?
LORELAI: Then I'll start jotting down mole locations along with you, but for now, let's take a flier on them.
MICHEL: I should never tell you anything.
LORELAI: Promise?
MICHEL: I'm going to leave a vaguely threatening note in their room. [exits]
LORELAI: No, no, no, Michel. No. [to his retreating form]
[ Standing alone in the lobby, Lorelai looks thoughtful. She digs out her cell phone and calls a number. ]
CUT TO CHRISTOPHER'S APARTMENT
[ Chris sits at a desk looking over paperwork. Telephone rings. Chris stands and moves to answer the phone. ]
CHRIS: Hello.
LORELAI: [cheerily] Well, if it isn't Mr. Incommunicado.
CHRIS: Lorelai.
[scene switches between the Inn and Chris' apartment]
LORELAI: I figured you'd turned Amish or something and couldn't make any calls until Rumspringa, but, no, here you are, answering the phone.
CHRIS: [a bit uncomfortable] Uh, yeah.
LORELAI: So, how are you?
CHRIS: Uh, fine.
LORELAI: Is this a bad time?
CHRIS: No, not at all. Uh, so, what's going on?
LORELAI: Not much. Just working at the old salt mine. But earlier, I was talking to Sookie who, by the way, got herself knocked up again, the crazy slut. So anyway, we were talking about babies and stuff, and she asked me about you and G.G., And that's when I realized I hadn't talked to you in a while, so here we are.
CHRIS: Sorry I haven't called. I've just, you know, been really busy.
LORELAI: Okay, well, no worries. I know you've got your plate full taking care of G.G. [pause] Um... are you sure this isn't a bad time? [chuckles nervously]
CHRIS: No. No, it's fine. Uh, fine.
LORELAI: Okay, so, how is G.G.? Is she still alive? The last time I was there, things were a little dicey.
CHRIS: She's good. Everything's fine, Lor. Everything's good. Your help was great, and I'm absolutely... fine.
LORELAI: Okay, well, good. So, I guess I'll talk to you later.
CHRIS: [pauses between phrases] Sure. Definitely, okay? I'll talk to you later. Take care.
[Lorelai is puzzled and a bit sad]
LORELAI: Okay. Bye.
CHRIS: Listen, Lor, I just want you to know that I only called you before because I was desperate. I mean, there was no other reason. I was just panicked, and I didn't think, you know?
LORELAI: Chris, sure.
CHRIS: I know that I shouldn't have bothered you. I know you have your own life and your own stuff and I shouldn't be bugging ya, but it was just a one-time thing, you know? So, you don't have to worry about it.
LORELAI: Chris, come on. You can call me anytime you want. You know that.
CHRIS: Yeah, well --
LORELAI: I'm always here for G.G., Whatever you need. Because we got bonds, baby. Just try to break 'em.
CHRIS: Thanks, Lor.
LORELAI: No problem.
CHRIS: Anyhow, G.G.'s great. I've got new pictures, too. I can e-mail them to you, if you want.
LORELAI: Or bring her around next time you're in the hood.
CHRIS: Stars Hollow's a hood now?
LORELAI: Oh, it's always been a hood. We just try to keep it on the down-low. But seriously, you should come by.
CHRIS: Well, I'm going to be adjacent to the hood on Saturday because I'm taking G.G. to see her grandparents.
LORELAI: Come by Saturday.
CHRIS: Are you sure? I don't want to --
LORELAI: come by. We can have lunch here at the inn -- you, me, and G.G. That way, I can check she's still got all her arms and legs.
CHRIS: All right, sure. Sounds good. Uh... Saturday it is.
LORELAI: Okay. See you then.
CHRIS: Yes, you will.
LORELAI: Bye. [Beeps as she clicks off her phone.]
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE – RICHARD'S POOL HOUSE
[Rory sits on the sofa as Richard fusses in the kitchen looking through all the cabinets. Classical music plays ]
RORY: Grandpa, it's fine.
RICHARD: No, it certainly is not fine. When you're entertaining an elegant young lady for dinner, then dinner is expected.
RORY: But I just sprang this on you. You can't be held accountable for your lack of elegant-young-lady food.
RICHARD: Well, I am delighted with your company, though I'm still a little confused at the new arrangement.
RORY: Well, Mom and I realized that we don't really get to spend as much time with you and Grandma since the separation, so we decided to split up.
RICHARD: Well, uh, how would you feel about, uh... ooh, some, uh, batteries and Nutella? [pulls them from the refrigerator shelf]
RORY: Oh, rats. I had that for lunch.
RICHARD: [puts items back and shuts door] Well, that seems to be all I have in here. Robert's shopping k*ll leave something to be desired.
RORY: So, grandpa --
RICHARD: Wait! I think I have some canned peaches. [goes hunting in another cabinet]
RORY: You've really made it comfortable out here.
RICHARD: Huh. Pears.
[Disappointed, Richard joins Rory and sips his drink]
RORY: Nice. Like a vacation spot. You know, fun and all yours -- not permanent, but fun for now.
RICHARD: Yes, well, fun for now is exactly what I was going for.
RORY: So, it's not permanent?
RICHARD: What?
RORY: The pool house. It's not permanent. You just said "fun for now."
RICHARD: Did I? I must have heard it somewhere.
RORY: I mean, don't get me wrong. It's good to shake things up every now and then -- you know, put a little paint on the house, move the furniture around the den, go blond -- but after you've done all that, it can also be nice to go back to something that's comfortable, something you've depended on for, let's say, 40 years. I mean, if something's been around that long, it must be for a reason, right?
RICHARD: You're a lovely girl.
RORY: I have good genes.
RICHARD: Oh! I think I remember seeing a frozen pizza in here.
RORY: Really?
RICHARD: Aha! Now... the downside of this discovery is that since Robert is currently doing all the shopping, this pizza could have been here since Lorelai's 10th birthday party. The upside, however, is that there is cheese in the crust.
RORY: I've always been a "glass is half full" kind of gal myself.
RICHARD: All righty, then. Here goes nothing.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE – MAIN HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai sits impatiently on the love seat while Emily fusses at the bartender cart.]
EMILY: [mutters under her breath] Stupid little -- I can't find -- ridiculous. He should have taken...
LORELAI: What, Mom?
EMILY: Oh, nothing. I'm just trying to make a proper drink, that's all.
LORELAI: Sorry about the change of plans.
EMILY: Oh, please. I'm as flexible as the next person.
LORELAI: See, Rory thought that since Dad's moved out to the pool house, we're not getting enough time with either of you, so --
EMILY: I guess I could use the ice in the freezer, though it's probably old. You know what they say – a little notice ensures fresh ice.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, who says that?
EMILY: We'll just have to have scotch neat.
LORELAI: Super.
EMILY: I'd offer you wine, but all the wine I have has to breathe.
LORELAI: And that requires notice.
EMILY: [ joins Lorelai on the loveseat. Lorelai stares.]. What are you looking at?
LORELAI: Nothing. It's just -- isn't -- isn't this weird to you?
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: Sitting next to each other?
EMILY: Would you like me to move?
LORELAI: No, it's fine. It's just... close.
EMILY: Will you explain to me again why we are doing this?
LORELAI: I have no idea because you usually sit over there.
EMILY: I'm talking about Rory being in the pool house, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Rory just thought we should split up tonight, get in some quality... couch time.
EMILY: It seems very silly. We had a perfectly good system worked out. I don't know why we changed it.
LORELAI: Mmm. [pause as she sets down her drink] So, Mom, do you think you and Dad are getting back together?
EMILY: Absolutely not.
LORELAI: Okay, got any peanuts?
EMILY: Your father has proven to me once and for all he's moved on with his life.
LORELAI: You don't think the moving on with his life would have actually included moving?
EMILY: No.
LORELAI: Okay.
EMILY: We attended the Dorman School Bazaar last week. It was a big, formal gathering. All our friends were there. And at dinner, he made me reach for the butter.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: It was sitting right there in front of him, and yet he didn't offer me the dish. He buttered his own roll, offered the dish to the man next to him, and that was it.
LORELAI: And that's why you think he's moved on?
EMILY: It was a total disregard for my needs. I might as well not have had a roll in front of me at all.
LORELAI: Well, Mom, I'm sorry.
EMILY: It's very upsetting. But at some point, you have to face the facts, and the facts are he's moved on, and therefore, I should move on also.
[Lorelai reaches for her drink in salute]
LORELAI: Absolutely. "Moveon-dot-Org."
EMILY: I think it's time for me to date.
LORELAI: [chokes on her drink] Oh, my God!
EMILY: I want to go on a date.
LORELAI: With... a man?
EMILY: No, a weasel. Of course with a man!
LORELAI: [tries to cover her ear with a free hand] I'm not hearing this.
EMILY: Why shouldn't I date? I'm still a viable commodity.
LORELAI: I need a paper towel and a valium, please.
EMILY: There are plenty of men at the club who, in the past, have made their interests in me known. I just need to figure out how to reciprocate their feelings. You have a lot of experience with men. How do you let them know that you're available?
LORELAI: Well, one of those bench ads usually does the trick.
EMILY: Lorelai, stop it. I need help here. It's been years since I did this, and I don't remember the proper procedure. Now, take me through this step by step. You see a man, you walk up to him, and you say...
LORELAI: Hello.
EMILY: Is that too forward?
LORELAI: No, it's the appropriate way to indicate you're open to a social engagement. Unless, however, you are approaching a weasel. Then I believe the proper signal is just to offer him your hindquarters.
[Emily glowers]
CUT TO OUTSIDE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE – FRONT DOOR – SOMETIME LATER
[Rory stands waiting as Lorelai exits the front door. Both slowly walk toward their vehicles]
RORY: Hey. My night was great.
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: Grandpa made frozen pizza. Granted, he made it on a cedar plank, which was not what the manufacturer intended, but I got a chance to say a lot of things to him -- things about living in the pool house and about him and Grandma, and though I used veiled references, I know he got my point, and he is definitely thinking about it. How did you do?
LORELAI: Grandma wants to date.
RORY: What?!
LORELAI: She wants to date men who hang out at the club and who have expressed interest in her in the past.
RORY: What do you mean, she wants to date? You weren't supposed to make her want to date. You were supposed to make her want to get back together with Grandpa!
LORELAI: Hey, I told you not to make me have dinner alone with her.
RORY: What did you say to her?
LORELAI: I said, "are you getting back with Dad?" And she said he wouldn't butter her roll.
RORY: I can't believe you.
LORELAI: I'm sorry. I tried.
RORY: You did not try.
LORELAI: I did try. I just sucked at it. Look, she probably didn't mean it, okay? She's just mad at Dad, and she was just talking. Next week we'll switch. You can have dinner with my mother, and I'll marry my dad off to a nice baroness.
RORY: Don't joke.
LORELAI: Don't hate me.
RORY: I don't hate you. I can't hate the pathetic.
LORELAI: Good. Now, I have a complaint to register. Because of your flawed plan, I was deprived of Friday night with my kid.
RORY: I was trying to reunite your parents.
LORELAI: Oh, sure. Now they're my parents. So anyway, I was thinking, if you're not busy tomorrow, how about you come meet me for lunch at the Dragonfly?
RORY: What time?
LORELAI: 1:00-ish?
RORY: See you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: And stay away from Grandma.
LORELAI: Ooh, gee, there's a demand.
CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN – NEXT DAY
[Lorelai leads Christopher down the staircase]
CHRIS: I like that it's got rooms. Very novel for an inn.
LORELAI: Mmm, the guests love it when they don't have to sleep communally. They pay extra for it.
CHRIS: Good squeaky stairs, helps sell the old-inn aspect.
LORELAI: Actually, we had those squeaks installed.
CHRIS: Squeakmasters?
LORELAI: Oh, you've used them?
CHRIS: Oh, several times.
LORELAI: Reception's over there, living room's through here. Hey, you recognize the bobblehead dolls on the mantel?
CHRIS: You put those out in public?
LORELAI: Hey, they are a cherished part of my childhood. Plus, all the dirty pieces broke off 10 years ago, so now they're just charming.
CHRIS: I like the jukebox.
LORELAI: I thought you would. And here's where we feed them.
CHRIS: You feed them, too?
LORELAI: And once a day we let them use the bathroom or sit on the furniture.
CHRIS: Classy joint.
CUT TO DRAGONFLY DINING ROOM – SHORT TIME LATER
[Lorelai and Chris are seated at a table. They both look through menus as a waiter deposits a basket of home-baked bread on the table]
LORELAI: So, I'm thinking you should order the steak sandwich and the garlic bread or – [to waiter] thanks. Or fried chicken -- seriously good fried chicken. Or, yeah, get the pork chops 'cause normally, eating pork chops is very similar to sucking on the pottery barn catalog, but Sookie does this brining thing in a saltwater bourbon solution. Sounds a little like laundry, but it's actually unbelievably good. [notices Chris grinning at her] Hmm. What?
CHRIS: Nothing. Just -- you did it.
LORELAI: [confused] I...
CHRIS: You did it. [waves a hand indicating the Inn]
LORELAI: Yeah, I think I did. [leans forward onto the table becoming serious]
CHRIS: How sappy is it going to sound if I say that I'm proud of you?
LORELAI: Oh, my God. So sappy.
CHRIS: Yeah, well, I am.
LORELAI: Thanks, Chris.
CHRIS: Yeah. Okay, so, I think you were trying to talk me into the pork chop.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] Yes, I was.
[Rory enters the dining room]
RORY: Mom. Hey, I –
[She recognizes her dad also seated at the table and comes to a halt. She thinly masks her disapproval.]
LORELAI: Hey, surprise! Look what Mommy dragged in.
CHRIS: Hey, Rory.
RORY: Hey, Dad.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] You haven't said hi to your sister yet.
RORY: Oh, right. [walks around and kisses the baby's forehead] Hey, G.G. Remember me? I'm Rory.
CHRIS: I show her your picture all the time.
RORY: [mild enthusiasm] Great. Thanks.
LORELAI: Your timing's perfect. I'm starved. Have a sit. Isn't this a nice surprise?
[Uncomfortable, Rory sits and stares at her lap unwilling to meet her dad's eyes]
RORY: Uh, very nice, yes. I like to see G.G.
LORELAI: How are you doing there, uh, G.G.? That thumb tasting pretty good there? If you soak it in a saltwater bourbon solution overnight, you'll see a major improvement.
[Rob, a bellboy, enters the dining room and approaches Lorelai]
ROB: Uh, Lorelai, excuse me. There's an incident in the front you may want to check in on.
LORELAI: Okay, Rob, thanks. I'll be right back. Don't say anything hilarious while I'm gone. [Lorelai exits]
CHRIS: Rory --
RORY: One thing. I've only asked you for one thing ever.
CHRIS: This wasn't my idea.
RORY: Stop.
CHRIS: Rory, I didn't call. After you asked me not to, I didn't. Your mother called me. [ Rory scoffs ] She called me because she hadn't heard from me in a while, and the reason that she hadn't heard from me in a while is because you asked me to stay away, and I did. Please stop shaking your head.
RORY: I don't believe you.
CHRIS: She called me, Rory. She called me. She asked me to lunch.
RORY: You didn't have to accept.
CHRIS: I had absolutely no good reason to say no. What was I supposed to do, tell her that you didn't want me to see her anymore? I didn't want to rat you out. I'm sorry. Look, I didn't even know you were going to be here. This is as much a surprise to me as it is to you.
RORY: Oh I see. So, you didn't think I was going to be here, so, therefore, it makes it safe to come because maybe I wouldn't find out about it.
CHRIS: No, Rory, no. That is not how it went down. You know what? I don't have to explain myself to you. I've done absolutely nothing wrong here.
RORY: Fine.
CHRIS: Look, I'm sorry you're upset, but you know what? Your mother and I have had a relationship long before you ever existed. We grew up together, we had a child together, and no matter what is going on, that does not change.
[Their voices grow louder]
RORY: Great. You knew her first. So that gives you the right to just waltz in and screw everything up?
CHRIS: I did not waltz in. I did not call her. You cannot make me the bad guy here.
RORY: Hey, if the black hat fits --
CHRIS: I'm your father, kid, okay? I think that demands a tiny bit of respect here.
RORY: Fine.
[Lorelai re-enters the dining room and sits back in her seat. She senses the tension.]
LORELAI: See, this is why I love this job. Michel has been obsessed with these guests who he swears are the notorious Bathrobe Bandits from the Independence Inn -- at least the moles match – [both Rory and Chris listen silently] so apparently, they were checking out, and Michel stopped them and demanded they open their suitcases, and they refused, so he grabs the guy's suitcase and starts tearing through all of his stuff, which, of course, went over really well. And when I got there, the wife was calling the cops, and the husband was chasing Michel around with a golf club. It took a comped bill and two free bathrobes in addition to the ones they had stolen to get them to drop the charges. Plus, Michel ripped his pants, and his underwear is pink and shiny. [Silence. Chris smiles weakly. Lorelai chuckles nervously ] Did I not hit "pink and shiny" hard enough? Should it have been "his drawers are pink and shiny"? I'm confused 'cause I was going to hit the Orpheum circuit with that materi
[Rory continues to silently look down without speaking]
CHRIS: [uncomfortable] Nope. Uh, nothing. Look, Lor, I should be going.
LORELAI: What? No, we didn't get our briny pork chops yet.
CHRIS: I know. I just -- I really need to get to my parents' house, and G.G.'s going to need her nap soon.
LORELAI: She can nap here.
[Chris gathers the baby bag and picks up G.G. from the highchair]
CHRIS: Oh, no, it's okay. The place looks great, really, and tell Sookie I said thanks from me, and bye, Rory.
RORY: Bye.
LORELAI: Chris.
CHRIS: [OS] I'll call you later.
[Lorelai watches as he exits]
LORELAI: Okay, start connecting those dots.
RORY: Did you call him and invite him to lunch?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Did you call him and invite him to lunch?
LORELAI: Yeah, I did.
RORY: He didn't call you?
LORELAI: No.
RORY: He didn't initiate this?
LORELAI: No.
LORELAI: Rory, what is going on? [Rory looks stunned] Huh? Answer me.
RORY: I went to see Dad.
LORELAI: When, today?
RORY: No, a while ago, right after Sherry left. I told him that I didn't want him to call you anymore.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Mom... come on.
LORELAI: No "Mom, come on." Why? Why did you do that?
RORY: I didn't want him to screw anything up between you and Luke.
LORELAI: Oh, kid. You are so far off here. That is not going to happen.
RORY: Every time he comes back, he ends up messing up your life.
LORELAI: Not true.
RORY: It's completely true. He wants you back, and then he disappears or Sherry gets pregnant or he loses his job or he just takes off -- whatever. No good reason necessary. And it's been like this forever, and you just let him do it. You can't help it.
LORELAI: Rory, come on.
RORY: You can't just break free of him.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
RORY: You're engaged to Max, and then suddenly, you're not.
LORELAI: Christopher had nothing to do with Max.
RORY: Who was the person you were calling from your bachelorette party?
LORELAI: I was drunk. I tried to call Abe Vigoda, too, if you remember.
RORY: You're just always waiting for him to get himself together.
LORELAI: No, no, hon. I'm not always waiting for him. There have been times when, yes, it would have been nice to actually be with the father of my kid, but... not now. I'm with Luke completely.
RORY: What did he say when you told him?
LORELAI: Told who what?
RORY: Luke. What did he say when you told him you were having lunch with Dad?
[Stunned, Lorelai exhales sharply, but recovers quickly.]
LORELAI: Nothing.
RORY: He didn't care?
LORELAI: No, he didn't care. He didn't have to care 'cause there's nothing to care about.
RORY: [somewhat unconvinced] If you say so.
LORELAI: I appreciate you being concerned for me, but don't be. I'm good.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Let's order, shall we?



CUT TO STARS HOLLOW SIDEWALK
[Lorelai and Sookie are walking together.]
LORELAI: She was so serious. You know how she gets really serious, like when she saw "The Way We Were," and she couldn't believe that Hubbell was going to leave Katie after she had the baby?
SOOKIE: Oh, I remember. She talked about it for weeks.
LORELAI: "How could he do that? She was the only one who cared about the blacklisting. She was the only one who thought he could write a novel." On and on and on. That's the face she had on today.
SOOKIE: She's just worried about you.
LORELAI: Then when she threw that "What did Luke say" thing at me.
SOOKIE: She's got a good left hook.
LORELAI: I lied to my kid, Sookie. I hate that I lied to her, but I didn't want her to think there was any weird reason why I didn't tell Luke.
SOOKIE: Was there any weird reason that you didn't tell Luke?
LORELAI: Sookie, come on.
SOOKIE: I don't know. Maybe you were afraid that he'd get jealous. I'd be afraid that Jackson would get jealous.
LORELAI: I was not afraid he'd get jealous.
SOOKIE: He did b*at up a car.
LORELAI: One time.
SOOKIE: That we know of.
LORELAI: No, I didn't tell him because it was no big deal. [ Sighs ] I thought it was no big deal. I should have told him, right?
SOOKIE: Well --
LORELAI: yeah, I should have told him. Now he's going to think I'm hiding something from him, and I'm not. Damn it. He's going to b*at up my car.
SOOKIE: [ Chuckles ] It's American. It can take it.
[They arrive at Sookie's house – Jackson approaches them carrying a giant set of "stage scissors"]
JACKSON: I came home from work, and I found these on the doorstep. What the hell is this supposed to mean?
SOOKIE: Hon, maybe it's just a joke.
JACKSON: No, this is not a joke. This is a threat.
LORELAI: Yeah, those people at Butterick Patterns play pretty rough.
JACKSON: This is the fish on the doorstep. It's the horse head in the bed. It's the "either your signature or your brains are going to be on the contract."
SOOKIE: Jackson, calm down.
JACKSON: I will not calm down! I told them I would not do any ribbon-cutting ceremonies.
SOOKIE: Who's "them"?
JACKSON: Them! The town. The lunatics who voted for me!
SOOKIE: Okay, could you put the giant scissors down and then do the waving around?
JACKSON: We have to move. Pack up. We're getting out.
SOOKIE: Okay. Or you could just ask them at the next town meeting not to leave giant scissors on our porch anymore.
JACKSON: Town meeting? Oh, no. No way. There will be no town meeting.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: There's going to be lots of upset people.
LORELAI: The town meeting is a 200-year-old tradition.
JACKSON: Tradition over! Only hell waits for me at town meetings. Spread the word. [stomps back into the house]
LORELAI: That's sweet. He's having sympathy mood swings.
SOOKIE: He loves me.
[They both follow Jackson into the house]
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai sits in front of an untouched plate of pie and cup of coffee. Luke bustles around the diner, pauses beside her. In a cheery mood, he leans close.]
LUKE: How are you doing? You need coffee?
LORELAI: No.
[As he returns behind the counter, he's surprised at her answer. Lorelai shifts nervously.]
LUKE: No?
LORELAI: Sure.
LUKE: Sure?
LORELAI: Yes, coffee good.
[He grabs the pot and checks her cup.]
LUKE: Your cup's full.
LORELAI: Oh, well, then, no. No. Coffee bad.
[ Both chuckle. Luke begins wiping down the counter. ]
LORELAI: Hey, did I tell you about the Bathrobe Bandits?
LUKE: Nope.
[He continues industriously wiping down the counter]
LORELAI: Uh, well, very funny story. Back at the Independence Inn, there was this couple, and they would come in all the time and steal the bathrobes. They made Michel crazy, so today –
LUKE: Up. [indicates her plate and coffee]
LORELAI: [lifts the plate] Oh, right. And today, they showed up.
[Luke wipes counter under her plate while holding her cup.]
LUKE: Who?
LORELAI: The bathrobe bandits – they showed up, and they stayed, and then they were checking out and then get this -- the bellboy comes running over and tells me to "come quick. There's a situation in the lobby." So I come running to the lobby --
LUKE: You can put your plate down.
LORELAI: Right. So, I run to the lobby, and Michel is being chased, and the wife is calling the cops, and I comped their room and gave them free bathrobes to stop the yelling and the calling. This is a very bad story.
LUKE: It wasn't that bad.
LORELAI: This is the second time I told it, and both times, crickets. [ Sighs and takes a sip of coffee ] I mean, Rory and Christopher looked at me like I was Pauly Shore.
LUKE: Christopher?
LORELAI: Rory's dad. He came for lunch today. I had lunch with him today, and Rory. Had lunch -- Rory and Christopher and G.G., His daughter with Sherry. He brought her 'cause Sherry moved to France, so he's a full-time dad now, and we all had lunch, all of us together... today. And when I told the "Bathrobe Bandit" story, they all acted like that. Except G.G., who spit up 'cause she's a baby. That's what they do.
LUKE: Okay. [turns and walks into the kitchen]
LORELAI: [ Sighs with relief ] Okay.
[ Cell phone rings and Lorelai clears her throat as she stands to walk outside to answer ]
LORELAI: Hello.
EMILY: [OS] You get over here right now!
CUT TO EXTERIOR OF LUKE'S DINER
LORELAI: Who is this?
EMILY: [OS] This is you in 20 years! "Who is this?" I swear!
LORELAI: Mom, calm down.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE – EMILY'S DRESSING ROOM
[Emily frantically rushes around the room in her satin robe and slip. She holds up a hangered dress to herself and looks in a full length cheval mirror.]
EMILY: He'll be here in one hour, and I have no idea what to wear. You've got to come right now.
[scene switches between locations]
LORELAI: Who'll be there in one hour -- Dad?
EMILY: Simon McLane.
LORELAI: Who is Simon McLane?
EMILY: He's my date.
LORELAI: What?!
EMILY: I have no idea what to put on, I'm in a blind panic, and it's all your fault!
LORELAI: How is it my fault?
EMILY: Because I used your line, and it worked.
LORELAI: What line?
EMILY: [OS] "Hello."
LORELAI: "Hello" is not my line. "Hello" is not a line. "Hello" is hello.
EMILY: Well, all I know is I "helloed" him today, and now he's taking me to dinner.
LORELAI: [OS] Uh, Mom…
EMILY: If you don't get over here right now, I'm going to book a D.A.R. function at the Dragonfly every single weekend from now until I die!
LORELAI: I'll be right there.
[ Beeps the phone off and hurries away ]
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE – EMILY'S DRESSING ROOM
[Lorelai enters to a room with clothes and jewelry strewn everywhere]
LORELAI: Mom? Are you -- [A bunched-up dress flies past her face onto a nearby bed] oh, God! Chanel attack.
EMILY: [OS] Look at the red pantsuit.
LORELAI: The... [looks around]
[Emily enters carrying two outfits. ]
EMILY: [frantically] The red pantsuit. The red pantsuit. Right there, right there, right there. [indicated with one of her laden arms]
LORELAI: I got it, I got it. [picks up the outfit] Here.
EMILY: Well?
LORELAI: Nice.
EMILY: Nice?
LORELAI: It's nice and red and panty-suity.
EMILY: It's horrible. He'll think it's horrible.
LORELAI: No.
EMILY: It's horrible. Simon will be here in 20 minutes, and I have nothing to wear. [tosses both garments she's carrying onto the bed]
LORELAI: Just tell him you're obsessed with "Butterfield 8" and go like that.
[Emily picks up another garment – dark colored – from the bed post and walks to the nearby dressing room door, picking up a second dark g*n garment.]
EMILY: I haven't done this in years. I have no idea what's appropriate to wear. I have no idea what's appropriate to say. I don't know what to talk about, what to order -- which one?
LORELAI: [ Chuckles ] They look exactly the same.
EMILY: They are not exactly the same.
LORELAI: Um, okay. Then... that one.
EMILY: Why?
LORELAI: Why what?
EMILY: [cross] Why did you pick that one? What was the logic behind your picking this particular one? Could it possibly be because it was closest?
LORELAI: [smiles brightly] Well, you know what they say about location.
EMILY: You're just picking anything so that I'll get dressed and you can leave.
[Emily shoves both garments into Lorelai's arms and walks back toward the bed. She searches frantically through a jewelry box]
LORELAI: No, Mom, I don't want to leave. I'm never leaving. In fact, I'm going with you.
EMILY: I'll never be ready on time. [ Panting ] I haven't finished my hair. I haven't finished my makeup. Oh, my goodness. I can't breathe. I'm actually having trouble breathing.
LORELAI: Mom, sit.
EMILY: I can't sit. I'll wrinkle my clothes.
LORELAI: You're not dressed yet.
EMILY: What? Oh, my God. I'm losing my mind. [they both sit on the edge of the bed] I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm dating. I'm single.
LORELAI: You're not single.
EMILY: [despondent] That's just a formality. You know, I remember the night I got married. Oh, I was panicked. I thought, "this is it. I'll never have a chance to be with anyone else. This is it for life." If only I'd had a crystal ball, I might have been able to eat my salad. I remember it looked delicious.
LORELAI: Mom, is this really what you want to do?
[Emily looks back at Lorelai with a serious expression]
EMILY: Yes, it is.
LORELAI: Okay. [ Sighs ] Wear the black.
[Lorelai holds out one of the gowns. Emily takes it gratefully]
EMILY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm.
[And in mid-step toward the dressing room…]
EMILY: What about the –
LORELAI: [without hesitation] – the g*n works fine, too.
[They exchange outfits and Emily disappears into the dressing room while Lorelai smiles smugly.]
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW STREETS – EVENING.
[Jackson's vintage truck pulls around a corner as it drives down the street. Miss Patty waves her hands frantically from the sidewalk flagging down the truck.]
MISS PATTY: Jackson! Jackson, stop! Oh, Jackson! [the truck stops. She approaches the window] Oh, thank God. I'm frantic!
JACKSON: What's the matter?
MISS PATTY: My accompanist just passed out. [pointing toward her studio]
JACKSON: She what?
MISS PATTY: She was playing the tarantella, and then suddenly, she stopped and fell off the stool. Come on! [pulls open his door]
JACKSON: [concerned as he gets out] Well, is she breathing?
MISS PATTY: I don't know.
JACKSON: Did you -- did you check her pulse?
MISS PATTY: No. What a good idea. Oh, you're such a smart man. [grabs his hand and pulls him toward the dark building]
JACKSON: Well, thank you.
MISS PATTY: A little faster, honey. The poor woman is just lying there.
[Patty pulls aside the door and they enter the dark room]
JACKSON: Well, maybe we should call 9-1-1.
MISS PATTY: She's right over there in the corner.
JACKSON: Why is it so dark in here?
[The light switches on to reveal a room full of town's people. Indistinct conversation. Jackson quickly turns to the door. Kirk slides the door shut and bars the exit. Jackson swings around to face Miss Patty. She holds the gavel in front of him determinedly.]
MISS PATTY: The town meeting is now in session.
[Defeated, Jackson takes the gavel. He glances back to see Kirk making menacing gestures as if using giant scissors.]
CUT TO OUTSIDE THE FRONT OF T.J.'S HOUSE – SAME NIGHT
[A work bench is set up with tools, pipes and thermos and cups. Luke busies himself cutting a pipe on one side of the bench, while on the other T.J. waves a pipe-cutting tool at Luke.]
T.J.: You know, we work pretty good together.
LUKE: I guess.
[T.J. pours himself a cup of coffee.]
T.J.: No "guess." We do. We got, like, a rhythm, a groove thing. We can survive in the woods together, start a new civilization, if need be.
LUKE: I think you'd need a woman for that.
T.J.: Oh, right. Okay, maybe Liz could come, except we couldn't share her 'cause she's your sister, and that's a bad way to start a new civilization.
LUKE: How about you and Liz go start a new civilization? I'll stay here in this one.
T.J.: No, come on. We could solve this. Okay, Lorelai could come. And now her, we could share.
LUKE: Okay, no more new-civilization talk.
T.J.: Okay by me.
LUKE: Hey, T.J.
T.J.: Yes, Luke.
LUKE: Do you consider yourself a jealous man?
T.J.: Why, are you planning on cutting some pipe with another guy tomorrow?
LUKE: Never mind.
T.J.: I'm sorry. You were asking me if I consider myself a jealous man. I don't, and let me tell you why. Jealousy is bad. Jealousy is what landed me in jail... twice. I learned quickly that without an immediate influx of cash, I could no longer afford to be a jealous man. Supply and demand, my friend.
LUKE: So, you're saying if Liz had lunch with... an ex, it's no big deal, right?
T.J.: Right.
LUKE: Right. I mean, it's an old ex, a long time ago, ancient history. But if she had lunch, and she didn't tell you about it at the time, but eventually she did tell you, you should just let it go, right? I mean, you don't want to be reading anything into anything. You just make yourself crazy and her crazy, and then everybody's crazy, right?
T.J.: [angrily] Who the hell is Liz having lunch with?!
LUKE: What? What? No one.
T.J.: You just said she had lunch with an ex!
LUKE: Come on, T.J.!
T.J.: Was it Art?
LUKE: No, its not..
T.J.: I swear to God, if it's Art, I'm going to -- I told him never to come sniffing around her again!
[T.J. storms off. Luke yells after him.]
LUKE: Hey, T.J.! Hey, it wasn't Art!
CUT TO ELEGANT RESTAURANT – OUTSIDE PATIO - SAME EVENING
[Emily and a well-dressed gentleman, Simon McLane, are seated at a small, intimately lit table. It seems to be at the end of the meal. Soft music plays in the background.]
EMILY: I have to tell you, every time I hear Mahler's Seventh Symphony, I get ridiculous, giddy. It's like The b*at on "The Ed Sullivan Show."
SIMON: Well, Mahler can do that to you.
EMILY: Did you see the Cleveland Orchestra when they were here last month?
SIMON: I went every single night.
EMILY: Oh, I should have done that. I went the last night and then to the gala afterward.
SIMON: Their conductor that night --
EMILY: Rudolfski.
SIMON: Did you know that he's deaf in his left ear?
EMILY: I did know that. [conspiratorially] In fact, I have a very evil friend who likes to sit next to him at all the gala dinners and whisper incredibly scandalous things into his bad ear all night long.
SIMON: Well, who knew Emily Gilmore ran with such a bad crowd?
EMILY: Oh, yes, I'm very dangerous. Ask my maids.
SIMON: Have I told you how happy I am you said hello to me at the club?
EMILY: Twice. And so am I.
[A waiter appears at the table]
WAITER: How are we doing here?
SIMON: We're doing fine.
WAITER: Would you like some more wine?
[Simon looks inquiringly to Emily. After a pause, she nods]
EMILY: Why not?
CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT DRIVEWAY – SAME EVENING
[Luke's truck pulls to a stop. Luke turns off the truck and turns to Lorelai.]
LORELAI: Okay, so, you know what's great about this country?
LUKE: Nope.
LORELAI: If you try hard enough, you can eventually find a showing of "St. Elmo's Fire" on the big screen.
[Luke smiles]
LUKE: Yes, that's what gets us the good seats at the Summits.
[Luke exits the truck to walk around to her side]
LORELAI: Come on, admit it. Rob Lowe pretending to play the saxophone was incredibly hot.
[Luke opens her door]
LUKE: [dryly] Oh, I admit it.
LORELAI: And also, Andrew McCarthy at his best. Though "Less Than Zero" runs a very close second.
[They both walk to her porch]
LUKE: I'm sure it does.
LORELAI: You hated the movie.
[They both laugh]
LUKE: Yes. Although I love the fact that it got me out of a town meeting, so all in all, a very successful evening.
[He pulls her close, very close. They kiss. Lorelai draws her hand up to his shoulder and deepens the kiss. She breaks the kiss.]
LORELAI: You sure you can't stay?
LUKE: [ Sighs with frustration ] I've got really early deliveries tomorrow. I'll make it up to you this weekend.
[He squeezes her repeatedly in his embrace.]
LORELAI: I'm going to hold you to that, Mister.
[They kiss again. Repeatedly. Lorelai slips from his embrace and walks toward her door, gazing back with a twinkle in her eye. Luke reluctantly steps down from the landing.]
LUKE: Oh, by the way... it's fine about lunch.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: You having lunch with Christopher -- I just want you to know I'm fine with it.
LORELAI: Oh, okay. Good.
LUKE: Yep, all right. See you tomorrow.
[ Truck door opens, then closes. Truck engine starts up. Lorelai stares a moment, mystified. She glances at her keys before letting herself inside.]
CUT TO RORY'S DORM – COMMON ROOM – THAT SAME NIGHT
[Paris is seated at the sofa. Many containers of take-out/delivery food lay strewn over the coffee table before her. Rory enters from her bedroom to gather up some books on the table]
RORY: Breaking your fast?
PARIS: [mouth-full of food] Oh, my God. I love food. You want some?
[ Knock on door ]
RORY: I'm good.
[Paris jumps to her feet and shoves Rory out of her way toward the front door.]
PARIS: It's for me.
[Rory, reacts slapstick style, landing in a nearby cushioned chair. The door opens.]
MAN: [OS] Pizza. $34.95
[Rory picks herself up and walks to the door]
RORY: Need some money?
PARIS: Oh, I got it. Do you want to have some? There's plenty. [She takes two pizza boxes from a delivery man.]
RORY: No, thanks. I'm going to Marty's.
PARIS: Okay. [She runs back to the table and the door closes. She eagerly flips open the first boxes lid. ] Well, where's the cheesy bread? I ordered the cheesy bread.
CUT TO MARTY'S DORM – HIS BEDROOM
[Rory is laying on the bed quizzing Marty on their studies. Marty is seated at the foot of the bed struggling with the topic.]
MARTY: Okay, I remember something about Rome. Rome. Rome. Romans lived there. Uh, Audrey Hepburn took a holiday there. It's the name of a "B-52's" song.
RORY: Different "roam."
MARTY: [Sighs] Okay, that's it. I can't remember. College is breaking my spirit. Every single day telling me things I don't know -- it's making me feel stupid.
RORY: Oh, okay, I need a break. [Closes her workbook and leans back]
MARTY: I second that.
RORY: Oh, man, I'm tired. Living is exhausting. This week sucked. I'm so glad it's over.
MARTY: Why did it suck?
RORY: Just a ton of schoolwork and Ramadan.
MARTY: Oh, sure.
RORY: I broke up with my boyfriend this week -- that was fun -- [Marty watches Rory with concern] in front of a bunch of people at my grandmother's house. And then, because apparently that wasn't enough "Peyton Place" for me, I have this whole thing going with my dad, who's suddenly back in my life again.
MARTY: Yeah, dads can be tough.
RORY: I spent so many years just -- I couldn't wait till he showed up. And now he's showing up, and... I don't know. I'm just really tired. [lays down her head]
MARTY: You know... once I found out my father wasn't really my father... we started getting along much better.
RORY: Stop it. [Chuckles sleepily]
MARTY: I'm serious. Suddenly the pressure was off. If something happens, I don't automatically have to give him a kidney. I can weigh my options. It was a real turning point in our relationship. [long pause] So, you broke up with your boyfriend, huh? Rory? [ He looks over to see her sleeping peacefully. He crosses his arms over a pillow and sighs with frustration. ]
CUT TO LORELAI'S RESIDENCE
[Lorelai emerges from the kitchen, switching off the light. Carrying a bowl of popcorn she sits on a living room chair, picks up and contemplates a DVD to watch. Telephone rings, answering machine beeps. ]
LORELAI'S MACHINE: I'm exhausted. The phone's far. Make it short and sweet. [Beeps]
CHRISTOPHER'S VOICE: Hey, Lor, it's me. Are you there? [pause] Okay, well, I'm just calling 'cause lunch ended bad, and I'm sure you've talked to Rory by now, so you know why it ended bad, and I just wanted to talk. [Lorelai approaches but stops herself from answering the call] Give me a call when you get in. I'll be up late. Okay, bye. [ Answering machine beeps off ]
[Lorelai stands a moment. She switches off the desk lamp, and begins walking up the staircase.]
CUT TO THE ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE – OUTSIDE
[Simon closes Emily's door and they slowly walk toward the front door.]
SIMON: It's been a long time since I've had an evening quite as enjoyable as this one.
[She stops and turns to him]
EMILY: I'm choosing to believe you, Simon, partly because it's flattering and partly because I've had three glasses of wine and a lemon cello.
[ Both chuckle. Emily continues to the front door. ]
SIMON: So, do you think we could possibly do this again sometime?
EMILY: That would be lovely, Simon.
SIMON: I'll call you this week. Good night. [He grasps and squeezes her hand warmly]
[ Emily enters the house and closes the door, a bare trace of a smile on her face. The sound of a car engine turns over outside. She looks around. Camera angle changes to show her looking around a large empty house. Her faint smile transforms to sadness. Her hand covers her face as she breaks down and cries. ]

OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW - SIDEWALK
[Lorelai is carrying a large garbage bag full of shoes and not looking where she is going. Miss Patty exits a shop.]
PATTY: Whoa, honey.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
PATTY: Goodness, what's left to wear on your feet?
LORELAI: I know it's a sickness. Everyone thinks it started with Bradshaw but actually it came over on the Mayflower.
PATTY: What a wonderful history lesson.
LORELAI: Anytime.
[Man shouting in a foreign language inside a shop. Lorelai drops her bag as something flies out the door at her.]
PATTY: Pasqualie's feeling unappreciated again.
LORELAI: We had 'Stars Hollow Loves Pasqualie Day' last week.
PATTY: Didn't stick. Oh, listen. I want to invite you to my anniversary party.
LORELAI: Absolutely. Which husband?
PATTY: Oh, no husband, honey. I'm talking about a lover that's been much more loyal and seductive than a husband. I'm talking about that business we call show.
LORELAI: Ah.
PATTY: Forty years.
LORELAI: No.
PATTY: Forty years ago today I did my first play off Broadway.
LORELAI: [awed] Off Broadway.
PATTY: Cleveland.
LORELAI: That is off Broadway.
PATTY: Anyhow, I thought I'd throw a big party. Food, booze, a little song, a little dance. A little salsa down your pants.
LORELAI: Well, count me and my pants in.
PATTY: Oh, wonderful!
LORELAI: [picking up her bag] I will even drag Luke there. So if there's any audience participation, please pick on him.
PATTY: Oh, Luke won't come.
LORELAI: Sure, he will. I have very effective methods of persuasion. They include extremely high heels and all of Jessica Simpson's bath products.
PATTY: Oh, no, honey. The party's on Tuesday the 30th.
LORELAI: So?
PATTY: So, the 30th is the dark day
LORELAI: [dropping her bag again] What dark day?
PATTY: Luke's dark day. The day that he disappears.
LORELAI: Disappears where?
PATTY: Nobody knows. Nobody knows where he goes or what he does. All we know is not to try and find him.
LORELAI: Why didn't I know about this?
PATTY: I don't know, honey. Everyone else does. Anyhow you come yourself, ok? Eight o' clock.
LORELAI: I'll be there. See you Tuesday, Patty. [Walks into shop] Oh Pasqualie, the maestro! My god, you look virile today. Are you sure your wife won't share you?
PATTY: [watching Lorelai] Oh, she's good.
CUT TO YALE - RORY'S DORM ROOM
[Paris and Terrance are sitting on the couch in the common room.]
PARIS: I don't agree.
TERRANCE: You're living in a fantasy world.
PARIS: I have classes all day long.
TERRANCE: I hear you protesting.
[Rory enters]
PARIS: I've got a double major of Poly Psy and Bio Chem, Terrance.
TERRANCE: I see you over-scheduling.
RORY: Sorry, I'm just getting water, here.
TERRANCE: Paris, you're not yelling at me. You're yelling at the world.
PARIS: I'm not yelling at all. This is the natural register of my voice.
[Rory looks around the room and in cupboards.]
TERRANCE: It's the register of a timid little girl, who is not putting her self out there.
PARIS: I am putting myself out there.
TERRANCE: Why are you arguing with Terrance? Why?
PARIS: Look, I know I haven't dated lately but Asher was very important to me.
RORY: Hey Paris? I can't find my notebook. The black one with all my yellow notes in it.
TERRANCE: You have not put yourself out there.
PARIS: He just died.
TERRANCE: Oh for god's sake! He was halfway dead when you met him. [to Rory] Rory, has she been putting herself out there or not?
RORY: Out where?
TERRANCE: Out in the world. Has she tried to meet men since Asher died?
PARIS: You don't just meet people. It doesn't happen.
RORY: Um, I'll just go in my room now.
TERRANCE: Look at your dream log. You are months behind. And your pretty-thoughts journal.
PARIS: Ok, fine. I have neglected thinking pretty, but I hardly think I should be penalized for time lost while you were in court ordered rehab.
RORY: [picking up a note by the phone] Hey, Paris? What's this?
TERRANCE: I had a back problem. The prescription was at home in my Filofax.
RORY: This is a message from Headmaster Charleston. When did Headmaster Charleston call?
PARIS: Earlier.
RORY: And you didn't tell me?
PARIS: I'm in session.
RORY: [on phone] Hello, Headmaster Charleston? This is Rory Gilmore. I'm sorry it took so long to call you back. I just got your message.
TERRANCE: [to Rory] Sweetie, that was a little passive-aggressive. We should talk later.
RORY: So, um, how are you? [Rory goes into her room and closes the door]
HDM. CHARLESTON: I'm very well. How are you enjoying Yale?
RORY: I love it.
CUT TO CHILTON - HEADMASTER CHARLESTON'S OFFICE
[Scene switches between Rory's room and Chilton]
HDM. CHARLESTON: Is it everything you thought it would be?
RORY: It's nothing like I thought it would be. It's better actually.
HDM. CHARLESTON: I have no doubt. Now, I'm calling because we often ask a former Chilton student to host a prospective Yale student for a few days. Show them around. Let them observe classes, campus life. That sort of thing. I was wondering if you'd be interested.
RORY: Me?
HDM. CHARLESTON: Yes. This is a very special young lady. Bright, focused, quietly determined. She reminds me a great deal of you.
RORY: Thank you.
HDM. CHARLESTON: I assume you haven't changed.
RORY: Well, I've upgraded the wardrobe a little bit but I'm basically still me.
HDM. CHARLESTON: Excellent. Then I hope you'll consider accepting. I know your workload must be substantial.
RORY: That's ok I can handle it.
HDM. CHARLESTON: So I can take that as a yes?
RORY: Yes. Take it as a yes and thank you. I'm honored.
HDM. CHARLESTON: Her name is Anna Fairchild. She's 16 years old and she'll be arriving Monday morning at nine o' clock. Does that work for you?
RORY: That works perfectly.
HDM. CHARLESTON: Very well, it's a date. I'm very glad to talk to you again, Ms. Gilmore. Yale certainly sounds like its agreeing with you. I hope it will also agree with Ms. Fairchild.
RORY: Like Sabrina!
HDM. CHARLESTON: I beg your pardon?
RORY: Sabrina Fairchild. That was her name.
HDM. CHARLESTON: Have we segued into discussing a movie?
RORY: And we can segue right out again.
HDM. CHARLESTON: I'm very grateful for that. All right then, my office will be contacting you with the particulars. I hope you have a wonderful time. I'm sure Ms. Fairchild will.
RORY: Thank you, Headmaster Charleston. I won't let you down.
HDM. CHARLESTON: What a nice thing to hear. I'm sure we'll be talking soon. Goodbye.
RORY: Goodbye. [Hangs up]
CUT TO ELDER GILMORES' RESIDENCE - POOL HOUSE
[Lorelai and Rory sit on a couch across from Richard in a chair.]
RICHARD: Well this is a very big honor, you know.
RORY: Oh, I know.
RICHARD: Of all the Chilton alumni at Yale they're asking you?
RORY: I know, I know.
RICHARD: Well, have you thought about what kind of things you'd like to show her?
RORY: Well, she'll go to all of my classes with me, of course. And I thought maybe she'd go to the paper with me and then I thought maybe a trip to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.
RICHARD: Oh, you're going to show her the Gutenberg.
LORELAI: Steve?
RICHARD: Bible.
LORELAI: Right.
RORY: Then I was torn between taking her to the Hewitt Memorial Quadrangle or the Science Center and Gymnasium.
RICHARD: Huh, that is a conundrum.
LORELAI: Yeah, especially since she'll be snoring by then. You'll just be dragging her dead body weight around the campus.
RICHARD: Lorelai, these things are of great interest to any young person considering attending Yale.
LORELAI: Oh, I am sure.
RORY: I, personally, would enjoy every single thing on my list.
LORELAI: Yes, I know, but it wouldn't hurt to maybe throw a little something fun in. I'm not talking a kegger, but just walk her by the crazy drama students yelling "Give me a location," or something like that.
RICHARD: You know, your mother may be right.
LORELAI: Who heard that?
RICHARD: Well, a good college experience is a well-rounded college experience. It's important for you to show her that Yale students have fun too. Oh! Have her touch the toe!
RORY: Yeah!
LORELAI: Touch the toe?
RORY: The toe! The statue of Theodore Woolsey. It brings good luck to everyone who touches his feet and for that reason he has one left toe that's been rubbed completely shiny.
LORELAI: Wow! That is fun. Make sure you get a parent consent form for that one.
RICHARD: Oh, its so exciting watching you at Yale. It was such a wonderful time for me. The people that you meet there will stay with you for the rest of your life, mark my words. Tell me are you making good friends?
RORY: Yeah, I have some good friends.
RICHARD: And what about Mr. Huntzberger?
LORELAI: Who is Mr. Huntzberger?
RORY: Um, Logan Huntzberger is a boy I go to school with.
RICHARD: A fine boy from a fine family.
LORELAI: You know him?
RICHARD: His parents are very good friends of ours. Oh, you know Mitchum Huntzberger, Lorelai.
LORELAI: No.
RICHARD: He's been coming to our Christmas parties for years.
LORELAI: No.
RICHARD: His mother's on the pediatric hospital committee with your mother.
LORELAI: Oh! No.
RICHARD: Well, Logan is their son and I noticed that you two seemed to be hitting it off the other night.
LORELAI: The other night?
RORY: He's very nice, Grandpa.
RICHARD: Now I don't want to be too forward, but you made a handsome couple.
LORELAI: Uh, was Logan at the male-Yale party that you guys threw?
RORY: He was the one that gave me a ride home, Mom.
LORELAI: Oh! Limo boy. Swell.
RORY: He's also on the paper with me.
RICHARD: You know, his father owns some of the finest newspapers in the country.
RORY: I know.
RICHARD: Not a bad connection, huh? Nope, not a bad connection at all.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORES' RESIDENCE - OUTSIDE
[Lorelai and Rory are walking to the main house]
LORELAI: Hey. So tell me about this Logan.
RORY: Its three degrees out here!
LORELAI: Uh, as of tonight, my father knows way more personal dish about you than I do. That's not right or fair. He doesn't get as much enjoyment out of the dish as I do. With him the dish is always half empty.
RORY: You're just talking to keep yourself warm, aren't you?
LORELAI: What is the deal with this guy? Are you dating?
RORY: No, we're not dating. He's just a friend.
LORELAI: How close? For example, if you freeze to death will he come to the funeral or just send a nice fruit basket?
RORY: I know him from school. He's just a casual friend. That's it.
LORELAI: Do you think he's cute?
RORY: It doesn't matter if I think he's cute.
LORELAI: Uh, it matters to me. I don't want ugly grandchildren.
RORY: Mom, I'm not dating Logan or anyone. I'm taking a boy break. Okay? I'm just concentrating on school. That's it.
LORELAI: Fine, but if that changes?
RORY: You'll be the first to know.
LORELAI: Okay, thank you. Cause there are not many ways I can outdo my father. Info on you and looking better in chiffon, that's about it. Oh and my pole dance is way hotter.
RORY: I'm frozen now.
LORELAI: Okay, let's go.
CUT TO LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Lorelai walks in wearing Luke's flannel shirt and carrying a whole pie on her arm. Luke is at the kitchen table pouring juice.]
LORELAI: In my hand, ladies and gentlemen, sits the true advantage of dating a diner owner. I am never more than ten feet away from pie.
LUKE: Ah. See, I thought it was the way we always smell faintly of meat.
LORELAI: [climbs into bed] Ah! Its heaven! One quick trip downstairs and I have all the treats I want. You're like Willy Wonka, but hotter.
LUKE: I am not hotter than Willy Wonka.
LORELAI: Slap on a purple top hat and you're close. [Luke gets into bed] This is nice.
LUKE: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: I think its going very well, you and me. Do you think its going very well?
LUKE: [rubbing Lorelai's leg] I have very few complaints.
LORELAI: Hmm, I'm going right past the "very few complaints" comment because I know you're just trying to bait me. What complaints? [Luke chuckles]Hey, so Luke, Miss Patty is celebrating her forty year anniversary.
LUKE: Which husband?
LORELAI: With the business we call show.
LUKE: Oh, him.
LORELAI: And she's having a big party and I told her we'd go.
LUKE: Oh man.
LORELAI: It'll be fun.
LUKE: It will not be fun.
LORELAI: She'll be wearing tap shoes. There'll be songs and punch and at least one story about Milton Berle's penis.
LUKE: Only one?
LORELAI: Come on! I have to have you there. Otherwise people will think I made you up.
LUKE: Fine, I'll go.
LORELAI: Thank you. Okay, so its Tuesday at Eight o' clock.
[ Luke sits up and climbs under the covers]
LUKE: I can't go Tuesday.
LORELAI: Why not?
LUKE: I have to go out of town.
LORELAI: Why?
LUKE: Business.
LORELAI: Business? Now your Willy Loman?
LUKE: Banking business in Woodbury. Standing appointment. Sorry. Hit the light, will ya? [kisses Lorelai] I have to get up early. Night.
LORELAI: [disappointed] Ok, night.
CUT TO YALE - RORY'S DORM
[Rory enters the room. Paris is at her craft table.]
RORY: Wait 'til you see all the stuff I got for Anna. Yale t-shirt, bulldog sweatshirt, Yale baseball cap, visor, coffee mug. I told you to open a window when your hot-gluing in here.
PARIS: Its freezing outside.
RORY: Oh wait. This is new. They just came out with these. The Yale soda-cozy. How cute is that?
PARIS: I can't believe you. You don't even have your loser card-swiping job anymore and you're buying all this crap for some kid you don't even know.
RORY: I'm trying to make her feel welcome.
PARIS: Oh she'll feel welcome. They all feel welcome.
RORY: Whose they?
PARIS: The enemy.
RORY: What enemy?
PARIS: Any girl under the age of 17 is the enemy.
RORY: Ok, I'm opening a window now. [walks to the window]
PARIS: They're coming for everything. They're going to take our jobs, our thunder, our starter husbands.
RORY: Don't you have a class to get to? [opens the window]
PARIS: They're coming, Rory. They're coming and they're going to keep on coming like the locusts descending on Mankato. We'll be b*at them off for the rest of our lives.
RORY: Please don't be here when she arrives. I don't want you to scare her off.
PARIS: Me scare her off? Please, she's the one with the alabaster skin and perky breasts.
[Knock at door]
RORY: Do not say perky breasts to her. Do you understand me?
PARIS: Eve Harrington has arrived.
[Rory opens the door]
ANNA: Hi. I'm looking for Rory Gilmore.
RORY: I'm Rory. You must be Anna.
ANNA: Yes.
RORY: Great, come in. Did you find it okay?
ANNA: I got lost a couple of times, but people were really nice and got me here.
PARIS: Yeah, it's a friendly world out there. Isn't it?
RORY: Anna, this is my roommate, Paris, and I'm sorry.
ANNA: For what?
RORY: Trust me.
ANNA: Ok.
RORY: Ok, let me show you around the place. That is Paris' room.
PARIS: Don't go in.
RORY: That is my room and this is the common room, which is also your bedroom. Bathroom is literally outside the door and there's a fridge with water or soda or whatever you want. Oh and I got you some 'Welcome to Yale' gifts.
ANNA: Oh, really? Thank you.
RORY: I'm really glad you're here. You are going to love Yale. It's an amazing place. I mean I was excited when I first started here, but every day is different and better. You have no idea how much there is to learn. It's -- Well you'll see.
[Knock on the door. Marty enters with a bag of food.]
MARTY: Okay, I actually snagged us some caviar. They were all out of toast points, but I think we can use Doritos and achieve a very similar result. [seeing Anna] Hey.
RORY: This is Anna.
MARTY: [gasps] Did Paris move?
PARIS: I'm right here, Marty.
MARTY: I know, Paris.
RORY: Anna, is from Chilton, my alma mater and I'm showing her around Yale for a couple of days.
MARTY: Oh, cool.
MARTY: I'll put this in the fridge... [Paris coughs] ...in my room.
RORY: Thanks. Ok, you ready?
ANNA: I'm ready. You have boys bringing you food!
RORY: Yale is a magical place, Anna. A magical, magical place.
[Rory and Anna exit.]
CUT TO YALE - OUTSIDE COURTYARD
[Rory and Anna are walking. Rory is talking, Anna writing down everything she says.]
RORY: The oldest part of the campus is, of course, the old campus. And it houses much of the undergraduate freshman class. It was g*n by Theodore Dwight Woolsey, president of Yale from 1846 to 1871. [Stops at bench] Over here is the Elihu Yale bench. Now Eli Yale was an officer in the British East India Company. He gave what was then called the Collegiate School 562 pounds, 417 books and a portrait of King George the first and so it was renamed in his honor. He actually gave an additional 500 pounds to the school, but Yale College never received it because he mistakenly sent it to the non-existent Collegiate School, apparently forgetting that Yale was named after him. [stops] Oh wait. This is the wrong bench. So keep the story but cross out the diagram. Moving on.
CUT TO YALE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE NEWSPAPER OFFICE
[Rory and Anna walk down the hallway.]
RORY: There's actually an ongoing rumor that you can automatically graduate and earn your degree if you become sufficiently fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Imagine all the tables you could wait with those k*ll, huh? [stops at door] Okay, you are about to get a first-hand feel of what it's like to work on a real newspaper. Now, be prepared. It can be an extremely hectic and fast-paced environment. Don't get intimidated and don't get in the way. Ready? Here it is.[They enter the room. It is mostly empty, save for a few people sitting around, doing nothing.] Everyone must be out getting a scoop or something, but you just wait. It could heat up in a second and when it does, man, watch out. My desk is over here.
[Paris and Doyle enter, arguing. Rory and Anna watch from the side of the room]
PARIS: I do not care.
DOYLE: Hey! I am the editor, Paris, and I demand that you tell me.
PARIS: I won't tell you where I got it, Doyle.
DOYLE: You will if you want to stay on this newspaper.
RORY: Okay, you are now privy to one of the classic journalist dilemmas between reporter and editor, the right to withhold and protect sources.
DOYLE: Dammit, Paris, you tell me where you got that pen right now.
PARIS: The pen fairy.
DOYLE: That was one of my personal fine point, gel tip pens from my bottom right-hand drawer and you went into that drawer and you took that pen and its mine.
RORY: Ok, for 'fine point gel tip' substitute 'confidential source deep within the administration.' Hmm, you get a little thrill. Don't you? [Phone rings]
DOYLE: And so help me . . .
RORY: Hang on a second. [on phone] Hey
CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN
[Scene switches between Yale and the inn.]
LORELAI: Question. Have you ever heard anything about Luke's dark day?
RORY: His what?
LORELAI: Well, one day a year he apparently has a dark day. No one knows where he goes or what he does. He just disappears.
RORY: I've heard nothing about this.
LORELAI: Ok, well, did we see him on November 30th last year?
RORY: How am I supposed to know?
LORELAI: Because, you keep all those crazy, a**l, Bob Graham kind of notebooks.
8:00 a.m. - Got up. 8:15 - Brushed teeth. 8:25 - Had impure thoughts. 8:36 - Sent dwarves off to work.
RORY: I do not have my diaries from last November on me, at the moment.
LORELAI: But you do have them?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: And they will contain where we ate breakfast that morning?
RORY: [embarrassed] Yes.
LORELAI: I love my little circus freak.
RORY: I'll call you later.
LORELAI: Hey! Did your mini-me show up?
RORY: Yeah, Anna. She's right here.
LORELAI: How's the tour going?
RORY: Its going great!
LORELAI: How many boring bench lectures did you give?
RORY: Two, but they were about the same bench.
LORELAI: [ Kirk appears in front of her.] You know what, I have someone standing abnormally close to me right now. I'll call you later.
RORY: Ok, say 'Hi' to Kirk for me.
LORELAI: Ok, bye. [hangs up] Kirk, what can I do for you?
KIRK: I have a business proposition for you.
LORELAI: Okay.
KIRK: How often do you slip in your tub?
LORELAI: Never.
KIRK: Okay, it doesn't work if you answer like that.
LORELAI: Constantly. I never stop slipping even when I get out.
KIRK: I thought so. Then my new line of bath and shower adhesive decals are for you. [Hands her a catalog]
LORELAI: Huh! Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.
KIRK: Yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
LORELAI: Well, Kirk, this looks very impressive. . . [flipping through catalog] and, wow, very expensive.
KIRK: Well its yesterday's retro designs in today's fashion colors with tomorrow's traction technology.
LORELAI: Hmm, well, why don't you leave the catalog with me and I'll look it over.
KIRK: Could you look at it now? It's the only one I have. [They sit.] I like that one. If you put the fish's faces together, it looks like they're kissing.
LORELAI: [chuckles] Oh! Hey, Kirk, do you know anything about Luke's dark day?
KIRK: Everyone knows about Luke's dark day.
LORELAI: Do you know what it is?
KIRK: Not the details. Just that he has it once a year. I think it goes back a long, long time.
LORELAI: Yeah?
KIRK: Sure, I mean Luke's always had a touch of darkness in him. I guess we all do but Luke's a little more touched than some. He's kind of grabbed actually.
LORELAI: What do you think it's about?
KIRK: When I was in 7th grade, Luke knocked the books out of my hands.
LORELAI: [intrigued] Because of his dark day?
KIRK: No, everyone knocked my books out of my hands. I was kind of a target. I used to wear a cape to school.
LORELAI: Hmm.
CUT TO YALE - LIBRARY
[Rory and Anna walk through the library stopping in an aisle.]
RORY: Now, outside, we just passed the women's table which was designed by Maya Lin. She's also the one who designed the Vietnam w*r Memorial which, by the way, originally was a class project for which she received a B. The teacher who gave her the B also submitted a design for the w*r memorial, but hers was chosen. His was not. That's a life lesson to remember. This is Sterling Memorial Library, one of my favorite places on campus. It was built in 1930 and it houses over one third of the university's ten million volumes. I love libraries. I spend I can't tell you how many hours just -- [looking at Anna] You're not writing.
ANNA: Oh, sorry.
RORY: So, I come her sometimes late at night --
ANNA: I just love how everybody's dressed.
RORY: What?
ANNA: No uniforms. I love that there's no uniforms. College to me means no more uniforms.
RORY: Oh, right. However, wait 'til you're late to class and it takes you 20 minutes to put together an outfit. Suddenly you'll miss those uniforms.
ANNA: How many guys have you dated since you've been here?
RORY: Oh. Well, none from Yale. Anyhow, the books. Are you seeing the books? Everything you'd want to read is right here? [Picking up book] Feel it. Feels good, right? Now smell it. [inhales and sighs] Nothing, nothing smells like that! [Logan enters]
LOGAN: I'm sorry, excuse me, did I just see you smell that book?
RORY: [embarrassed] Hey, Logan.
LOGAN: Hey, Ace. Who's your friend?
RORY: Oh, um, Anna, this is Logan. Logan, this is Anna. She's from my high school. I'm showing her around campus.
ANNA: Hi
LOGAN: High school? No, I would've sworn you were a college girl. [Anna giggles] So is she showing you a good time?
RORY: I'm showing her everything important.
LOGAN: Hmm, good. Make sure she takes you by the pub. Local place, everyone goes there.
RORY: I'm not taking her to the pub.
ANNA: Oh, please? The pub sounds fun.
LOGAN: You don't have to drink. They do have coffee. It's a cool scene. Make her take you. Bring a book to sniff.
RORY: What are you doing in the library anyhow?
LOGAN: I got lost. Don't tell anyone I was here. It'll ruin my rep. Anna, it's been a pleasure. See you, Ace. [Logan exits]
ANNA: He's cute.
RORY: Yes, he is. But not as cute as Pushkin. Right this way, missy.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW - SIDEWALK
[Lorelai is driving down the street and sees Luke arguing loudly with a little old lady.]
LUKE: Fine! Do whatever you want!
MRS. THOMPSON: Well, I'm sorry you're so upset.
LUKE: You're giving me a week's notice! What am I supposed to do with a week's notice?
[Lorelai gets out and walks up to them.]
MRS. THOMPSON: Well, my son just called me from Florida to tell me about the condo, Luke.
LUKE: Fine! Go enjoy Florida. I hear they have great weather there. Terrific hurricanes. Make sure you bring plenty of plywood and bottled water!
LORELAI: Hey, hi, hello.
LUKE: What are you doing here?
LORELAI: I was just driving down the street and saw you and thought I'd stop by and say "Hey, hi, hello." Hello, Mrs. Thompson.
MRS. THOMPSON: Hello, dear.
LORELAI: So, what's going on?
LUKE: Nothing. Nothing's going on.
MRS. THOMPSON: Luke, please understand. There's nothing I can do. I've already found someone to rent the house and they have cars.
LUKE: And you just agreed to that?
MRS. THOMPSON: It seemed rather reasonable to me.
LUKE: Oh, come on.
LORELAI: [confused] Um . . .
MRS. THOMPSON: Luke's very upset with me.
LORELAI: Why?
MRS. THOMPSON: Well, his father rented the garage. He was building a boat and he didn't have room at his place. So he paid me to do it here and then when he died Luke continued to pay for the garage and now I'm moving to a nursing home and I need him to move his boat.
LORELAI: [to Luke] Wait, you're mad because this little, old lady is moving to nursing home and you have move your boat? Is this really the story you want to stick to?
LUKE: She called me out of blue and I paid for an entire month.
MRS. THOMPSON: I can give you a partial refund if you like.
LUKE: Where am I supposed to find a space to store a boat on a moment's notice, huh? Did you think about that for even a second?
MRS. THOMPSON: Could we sit down? The doctor says the screw in my hip is loose.
LORELAI: Yes. Yes, let's sit. Let's sit and calmly try to figure this out.
LUKE: No. No, I've got it figured out. Just haul it off. Trash it.
MRS. THOMPSON: Haul what off?
LORELAI: The boat?
LUKE: Yes, the boat. Scrap it. Find somebody to drag it away and cut it up for firewood.
LORELAI: Oh, now Luke.
MRS. THOMPSON: Who's going to haul it off?
LUKE: Anyone. Just find a guy with a truck and a hook. He'll strap it on and drive it away and send me the bill. I'm done. [Luke walks away]
LORELAI: Luke! [to Mrs. Thompson] I'll be right back. [Chasing Luke] Luke, stop! What, what and what?
LUKE: I have been paying that woman every month for 15 years.
LORELAI: Luke, she moving to a nursing home.
LUKE: And my dad was paying her every month 20 years before that!
LORELAI: Nursing home, Luke.
LUKE: I know where she's going!
LORELAI: She's not trying to hurt you.
LUKE: Whatever. [Starts to walk away]
LORELAI: Hey! Where are you going?
LUKE: Back to the diner.
LORELAI: Let me drive you.
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Luke, I can drive you back to the diner. I promise if we pass any senior citizens I'll let you jump out and pants them.
LUKE: Fine.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER - STREET OUTSIDE
[Lorelai pulls up in front of the diner. They sit in the Jeep.]
LORELAI: And over here we have the world famous Luke's diner, home of the best coffee on the east coast and the most delightful and chatty proprietor since Mel kissed Flo's grits. [Luke is quiet and makes no attempt to get out.] Okay, well, I should get back to the inn. [Luke is still quiet] I hope you've enjoyed your tour and don't forget to buy yourself a souvenir plastic monkey on the way out.
LUKE: Tomorrow's the anniversary of my dad's death.
LORELAI: [sympathetic] Ugh. Oh, hon.
LUKE: And every year on that anniversary I, uh, I disappear. I don't work. I don't talk to anyone. I get in this kind of a funk. Its like I'm --
LORELAI: You have a dark day.
LUKE: Yeah, I have a dark day. I thought I should tell you this because we're in relationship and I thought you might wonder why I suddenly don't answer the phone or I'm not around. Why you can't flip your hair and con me into going to Miss Patty's crazy anniversary party.
LORELAI: The hair flip is that effective, huh?
LUKE: Combine that with your black dress and you could probably get me to be your backup dancer.
LORELAI: I'll remember that.
LUKE: I've never told anyone this before. I don't really like to talk about it.
LORELAI: I guess that explains the thing with Mrs. Thompson.
LUKE: Yeah. Some timing, her springing this boat thing on me now. I'll apologize to her. [Sighs]You know he never finished that boat. It's been sitting there half done for 15 years.
LORELAI: Hey, Luke, don't you think you might have been a little too hasty about the boat decision. I mean your upset and I bet someday you're gonna be really sorry you don't have that boat anymore.
LUKE: No, its better she gets rid of the thing now.
LORELAI: But --
LUKE: I haven't even looked at that boat since my dad got sick. Not a glance, nothing.
LORELAI: Even more reason.
LUKE: If its gone then I don't have to deal with it. Its time to move on. You know?
LORELAI: But --
LUKE: I'm fine. Really. Thanks for the ride.
LORELAI: Anytime.
[They kiss. Luke gets out.]



CUT TO YALE - THE PUB
[Rory and Anna enter.]
ANNA: I love it here.
RORY: You love it here? We just walked in.
ANNA: I know but it feels so collegiate.
RORY: Actually, you know what is great about this place?
ANNA: Eli Yale drank here?
RORY: No, they make amazing cappuccinos. Do you want one?
ANNA: Yeah.
RORY: Ok you go sit and I'll get the coffees. [Anna sits and Rory walks up to the bar.] Two cappuccinos, please.
[Marty walks up]
MARTY: Hey.
RORY: Hi. You just get here?
MARTY: Yep.
RORY: You want a - [gestures to the bar]
MARTY: Yes, please.
RORY: [to bartender] I'm sorry, could you make that three cappuccinos?
MARTY: So, how's it going?
RORY: I think I may have overwhelmed Anna. Her hand cramped up about an hour ago and its been spasming ever since.
MARTY: Where is she?
RORY: She's right - [sees Anna at a table talking to two boys.] I turn around for one minute.[walks to table] Excuse me.
ANNA: Oh, Rory! Mark and Matthew were just telling me about a great party tonight.
RORY: Really? Well, that was very nice of them. Thank you. Matthew and Mark, was it?
MARK: That's right.
RORY: Well, how biblical. Ok, well, our schedule is completely full at the moment. [Anna's face falls] But if that changes, if things lighten up or if she suddenly ages two years in the next three hours, then we'll know where to find you. Ok? Bye-bye now. Bye-bye.
MARK: [getting up] We'll be over here, just in case.
ANNA: Rory!
RORY: Anna!
ANNA: Well, this is so not fair. [Marty sits down with the coffees.] You get to talk to boys.
RORY: What?
ANNA: Well, you were over there talking to Marty.
RORY: That's different. Marty is just a friend. [Marty's face falls.] Which is another great thing about college. You learn to have guy friends. Nothing romantic, just a good pal. Those boys are not interested in your friendship, unless the word friendship is tattooed on your butt. Now, drink your coffee. It's good, huh?
[Anna nods.]
CUT TO YALE - RORY'S DORM ROOM
[Rory's common room. Rory and Anna are in their pajamas.]
ANNA: Can I sleep with the TV on?
RORY: Um, yeah, as long as you don't wake Paris up, and that advice is for your own good.
ANNA: And if I can't go to sleep?
RORY: Then you don't go to sleep.
ANNA: I love that! I love not having someone to tell me when to go to sleep.
RORY: Yes, it's great.
ANNA [Giddy]: I love sleeping with the TV on, and I love having no parents around, and I love cappuccino, and I love apple muffins, and I love college!
[Paris comes out of her room, dressed to go out.]
PARIS: What's she on?
RORY: Four cappuccinos and three Red Bulls from the fridge.
PARIS: Enjoy your night. How do I look?
RORY: Where are you going?
PARIS: I'm putting myself out there, Rory.
RORY: Now?
PARIS: Yes now.
RORY: Its eleven o' clock at night. Who are you hoping to hook up with now? Spike and Drusilla?
PARIS: Just tell me if my lipstick looks too whore-ish.
RORY: Nope, just whore-ish enough.
ANNA: [excited] Going out at eleven o' clock at night! I love college!
PARIS: I may suffocate her when I get back.
RORY: If you can catch her.
PARIS: Bye.
RORY: Good luck.
RORY: Goodnight, Anna.
ANNA: Goodnight.
[Anna sits on the couch bouncing with excitement.]
CUT TO YALE - CLASSROOM
[Rory and Anna sit in a classroom. Anna is dozing off.]
PROF. BELL: Which brings us to this question, does Campbell's work successfully resolve the disparate stances of Jung and Freud when it comes to the collective unconscious?
RORY: Hey, pay attention. Professor Bell is one of the foremost philosophy professors in the country.
PROF. BELL: . . . All right. Let's call that close enough. But, now, Campbell can point to the repetition of the hero myth in culture after culture and say "Hey, Sigmund, like it or not here are the same basic characters over and over -"
[Colin enters]
COLIN: Excuse me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
PROF. BELL: I'm right in the middle of a class, young man.
COLIN: I know, I'm sorry, I just -- [Runs up to stand by Rory's desk.] Rory, you can't just walk out like that. Not after everything we've been through. You just left. I was still in bed. I mean what is that all about?
PROF. BELL: Ok, you need to do this later.
COLIN: I can't do this later. Rory I love you. I love you, dammit! How many times to I have to tell you? God! Just talk to me.
PROF. BELL: Ok, out right now! Out! Just get -
[Logan enters.]
LOGAN: Colin! What are you doing, man?
COLIN: Get the hell out of here!
LOGAN: She's with me now. I told you that. Let it go.
COLIN: I will not let it go!
LOGAN: She doesn't love you. Rory, tell him you don't love him!
COLIN: Everything was fine until you came along!
LOGAN: Oh, don't blame me because you couldn't keep her.
COLIN: I swear to god, I'm gonna k*ll you!
LOGAN: Oh, I'd love to see you try.
[Colin lungs at Logan. Boys begin fighting]
PROF. BELL: Stop it! Stop it, right now! Anthony, get security! Break it up! What are you -- Gentlemen, you are losing control! [Logan throws Colin over a desk and jumps onto him.] You are in a classroom!
[Finn enters wearing an old-time police uniform.]
FINN: [blows whistle] All right, that's enough! Break it up, you two! [Grabs the boys, while the Professor realizes this is all a joke.] Rory Gilmore, you should be ashamed of yourself, toying with these boys like this! They used to have pride! They used to have dignity! They used to have balls! [Starts to leave, but stops.] Dammit Gilmore, give them back their balls. [Boys exit room, but re- enter and bow, while class cheers and applauds]
CUT TO GILMORE RESIDENCE - OUTSIDE
[Lorelai and Sookie drag a tree across the lawn towards the garage.]
SOOKIE: God, this is a lot of junk.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: I mean, who has three Thigh Masters besides Suzanne Somers?
LORELAI: Well, Mrs. Thompson apparently.
SOOKIE: You'd think if you had three Thigh Masters, you'd wear slacks once in a while. I'm sorry, why exactly, did you have to take all this crap?
LORELAI: It was the only way I could get her to give me the boat. Some guy wanted it and she got him to buy all her other crap. So, if I wanted the boat I had to take everything and that's what I did. I just have to hide it for a few days. Then, I'll move it.
SOOKIE: Where?
LORELAI: I don't know. Somewhere. The inn. I'll put it in the old stable out back.
SOOKIE: Are you ever gonna tell Luke?
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: When?
LORELAI: A week, a year. I haven't thought that far in advance. I just couldn't let her get rid of his dad's boat. What if we hang the Thigh Masters on it?
SOOKIE: Or get more trees!
LORELAI: Yeah! Or get more trees.
SOOKIE: Jackson's got some trees at home.
LORELAI: Think I could borrow them?
SOOKIE: Sure. We'll just wait 'til he lies down for his nap and sneak 'em right out of there.
LORELAI: Great! Then, I'll hop a fence and get Richard Widmark to sign my grapefruit.
CUT TO YALE - CLASSROOM
[Boys are sitting at tables, while the women stand in front of them.]
WOMAN: I'd like to welcome you all to today's speed-dating session. Many of you have been with us before. Many of you are first timers. So, for the latter group, here are the rules. Each couple will have one minute to talk and get a sense of the person across from them. When the bell rings, the women will get up and switch tables. Men, stay where you are. This will continue until every woman has met every man and after that it's up to you. Are you all ready? Then, let the dating begin.
[Bell rings. Paris sits down.]
JACK: I'm Jack.
PARIS: I'm Paris.
JACK: Did your parents travel a lot?
PARIS: Why?
JACK: Your name's Paris.
PARIS: No. Did your parents change flat tires a lot?
JACK: What?
PARIS: Or plug the phone into the wall a lot?
JACK: No.
PARIS: Great! So, we've cleared up that mystery. What's next on your fascinating list of talking points?
JACK: Uh, what's your major?
PARIS: Seriously, you've got one minute to make an impression and that's all you can come up with? You want to know my sign too, Jack? Or how about my favorite color? Or if I'm a Britney or a Christina? Here, I'll ask you a question. Was the last time you had an interesting thought, when you considered flinging yourself off a building? [bell rings] Bye, Jack. I'll write Mother immediately. [Sits down at the next table.] Paris, and no my parents didn't travel.
BILLY: Billy, and I have no idea what that means.
PARIS: Never mind. So, what's your story, Billy?
BILLY: Well, I'm a drama major.
PARIS: Ding, ding, ding! [stands up and moves to next table, seeing Doyle] Doyle.
DOYLE: Paris.
PARIS: Surprised to see you here. [Sits down]
DOYLE: I could say the same for you.
PARIS: So, you find any good prospects?
DOYLE: Oh, yes. One girl wants to have 11 children.
PARIS: Good god!
DOYLE: And the second one was cut off quickly, thank you by the way. I think the words 'latter day saints' were about to come out of her mouth.
PARIS: I can't believe I came here.
DOYLE: This is my third time.
PARIS: You ever meet anyone you actually wanted to date?
DOYLE: My bar is so not that high.
PARIS: [Looking around] I don't see one person in this room that shouldn't be sterilized immediately.
DOYLE: Right there with you.
PARIS: So you've been reading about those skeletons they've been finding on the island of Flores, right?
DOYLE: Oh, yeah, and they're only 13,000 years old. That's nothing in geological time.
PARIS: They made tools and probably had a language. And - [Bell Rings and the next girl tries to join] Keep moving sister.
DOYLE: They were supposed to be master hunters.
PARIS: Even though they were diminutive in size.
CUT TO YALE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE RORY'S DORM
[Rory and Anna are walking down the hall. Anna looks excited. Rory looks tired.]
ANNA: And then when that other guy came in, in that outfit! How great was that?
RORY: We also studied Dylan Thomas today. Why don't we talk about that for a while?
ANNA: Yeah, that was cool, but when Logan and Colin started to fight, that was so amazing![They enter the dorm room.] The teacher had nothing to say. Nothing! He just stood there. Think they'll get in trouble for that?
RORY: Oh, probably not.
ANNA: Oh god, that's great! The freedom! I mean you can do anything in college. No rules, no consequences.
RORY: Well, Anna, there are always consequences. You're getting the wrong idea. College is not just a crazy, wild, sleep-deprived hedonistic society.
[Doyle exits Paris' bedroom in her robe.]
DOYLE: Oh, it wasn't the TV.
RORY: No, it wasn't the TV.
DOYLE: This isn't what it looks like.
RORY: I hope not.
[Paris enters in only a pajama top]
PARIS: I told you it wasn't the TV.
RORY: [brightly] Hi, Paris.
PARIS: All right, fine. Doyle and I had sex.
RORY: Okay, Anna, get your coat.
PARIS: We met at speed dating and we considered having dinner first, but we both knew where it was going to end up, so we figured we'd just cut to the chase and save the calories.
RORY: Hurry up, Anna.
ANNA: Where are we going?
RORY: Dinner.
ANNA: Its only five.
[Rory and Anna exit]
PARIS: You have no right to be repulsed by my sex life!
DOYLE: [to Paris] This is an exceptionally comfortable robe.
ANNA: [in the hallway] Dinner whenever you want. Random sex whenever you want. I can't wait to go to college!
CUT TO YALE - CAFETERIA
[Rory and Anna sit at a table]
ANNA: Ice cream and cereal for dinner!
RORY: Yeah, yeah, yeah college rocks.
[Logan enters.]
LOGAN: Ladies.
ANNA: Hi, Logan.
LOGAN: How are we doing this fine evening?
ANNA: Oh, we're doing great. Do you want to join us?
LOGAN: Sure. [Sits down next to Rory] So, dull day, huh?
ANNA: Not for me.
LOGAN: [Looking at Rory] Someone's quiet.
RORY: Got nothing to say.
LOGAN: [to Anna] Do you get the sense that she's mad at me?
ANNA: Yes.
RORY: Hey, Anna, why don't you head on over to the fro-yo social. You remember where it is right?
ANNA: Yeah, but I just had three scoops of ice cream.
RORY: Kid, you're in college now, ok? Now go get yourself some yogurt.
ANNA: Are you going to come Logan?
LOGAN: Uh, I'm not sure how well I'll be walking here in a minute, Anna.
ANNA: Oh, ok. Bye.
[Anna exits]
LOGAN: That's not a good look.
RORY: I have no words.
LOGAN: It was just a joke.
RORY: Oh no, wait. I found some. Jerk, ass, arrogant, inconsiderate, mindless, frat boy, lowlife, buttface miscreant.
LOGAN: Buttface miscreant?
RORY: Why would you do something like that?
LOGAN: I'm sorry, buttface miscreant?
RORY: Here I am, trying to show Anna what college life is really like.
LOGAN: That is what college life is really like.
RORY: Maybe your college life, not mine. That was my class, Logan. That was my professor, who decides my grades and you made me look ridiculous to him.
LOGAN: No, I made me look ridiculous to him.
RORY: Oh, you don't think he thinks I was a part of it?
LOGAN: I'll talk to him. I'll tell him you were an innocent bystander.
RORY: The whole class was in a frenzy the entire time. We never got back to what we were talking about.
LOGAN: There's another class next week.
RORY: Ugh, I know that classes and the paper and Yale in general mean nothing to you, but it means something to me. Professor Bell's course is only six weeks long and you blew one of those weeks for me. I won't get that week back.
LOGAN: Look, you want to pull some personal time with Bell? My dad knows him. He'll arrange --
RORY: Please stop talking.
LOGAN: I'm sorry you're so bent out of shape. I didn't mean to upset you.
RORY: Anna thinks that Yale is just a big joke.
LOGAN: If Anna thinks that Yale is just a big joke after spending five minutes with you, then she was always going to think that Yale was just a big joke. Relax.
RORY: You and me? Very different people. I have to go.
LOGAN: To the fro-yo social?
RORY: Yes, I have to go to the fro-yo social. And yes, I do realize how incredibly stupid that just sounded. Excuse me.
[Rory exits]
CUT TO YALE - RORY'S DORM ROOM
[Paris and Doyle sit on the couch, in front of the phone]
PARIS: All I'm saying is, I just want a little information.Is this a relationship? A one night stand? The beginning of a series of late night bootie calls? I think I have the right to know.
TERRANCE: [on speaker phone] I hear you. Doyle, do you hear her?
DOYLE: I do hear her. I just don't understand why we can't decide this amongst ourselves.
TERRANCE: Because you can't, Doyle. Now, please tell Paris how you feel.
DOYLE: Well, I feel --
TERRANCE: Into the phone, Doyle. I can't hear you.
[Rory enters.]
RORY: Is Anna here?
PARIS: No. Why?
RORY: She didn't show up at the fro-yo social.
DOYLE: Eww. Do you blame her?
RORY: I have to find her.
PARIS: Why? Did you loan her money or something?
RORY: Just go back to what you were doing, please
RORY: [dials phone] Hey, Marty? Um, I lost Anna. I don't know where. Um, just -- Thanks. [to Paris] If she comes back here, call me.
CUT TO YALE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE RORY'S DORM ROOM
[Marty comes down the stairs]
MARTY: Any idea where she'd go?
RORY: No, she was supposed to meet me. I can't believe I let her go off by herself.
MARTY: Well, we'll find her.
RORY: [dialing phone] Mom?
CUT TO GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Scene switches between Yale and Gilmore's.]
LORELAI: Hi.
RORY: Where would a 16 year-old girl go for a good time?
LORELAI: Oh, how sad you had to come to me for this conversation.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: You were 16 a lot more recently than I was.
RORY: I lost Anna.
LORELAI: How did you lose Anna?
RORY: She never showed at the fro-yo social!
LORELAI: Oh, ok. Relax. Sixteen year old girl at college? Uh, you have to check parties. Bars and Chinese restaurants rarely card.
RORY: No Chinese restaurants around.
LORELAI: The pub? Did you check the pub?
RORY: No. [to Marty] The pub. We have to check the pub. Parties and the pub.
LORELAI: Ok, call me when you --
LUKE: [off-screen] Ow!
LORELAI: Uh . . .
LUKE: Ow!
LORELAI: I have to go, hon. Call me when you find her.
RORY: Okay. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye. [hangs up]
CUT TO GILMORE RESIDENCE - FRONT PORCH
[Lorelai exits house. Luke is rubbing his leg.]
LORELAI: Oh my god, are you ok?
LUKE: I smashed my leg on a Thigh Master.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry.
LUKE: Then, I tripped and smashed my other leg on another Thigh Master.
LORELAI: Sorry.
LUKE: Why the hell do you have so many Thigh Masters?
LORELAI: I have a really bad thigh complex. Are you bleeding? Do you want to come in?
LUKE: No, I'm fine. I just -- You left your glasses at my house. I thought you might need them.
LORELAI: [Luke hands her, her glasses] Thank you.
LUKE: I didn't you think would be here. I thought you were going to Patty's.
LORELAI: I am. I was just leaving but I don't have to go if you want to come in.
LUKE: No, its ok. I'm still going through my dark day. I'm gonna go.
LORELAI: Ok, sorry about your foot.
LUKE: [Looking at her garage.] What's going on with your garage?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Your garage door looks all weird.
LORELAI: Oh. No, it's fine. It's just jammed a wee bit.
[Luke limps toward the garage]
LUKE: You can't leave it open like that. You could ruin all your stuff.
LORELAI: [Following Luke.] No, no that's ok. Too much stuff anyhow. If a little bit gets ruined, it serves me right for being so darn materialistic.
LUKE: What are all these trees doing here? [Begins to pull trees away.]
LORELAI: No, just stop. Go back to your dark day. No, no, don't, don't. There's clowns in there. And puppies wearing costumes. And they'll cheer you up and then your dark day will be ruined.
LUKE: [seeing his boat] What is this?
LORELAI: It's your boat.
LUKE: I thought I told her to get rid of this boat.
LORELAI: She did. She sold it to me, along with all of her other crap. She made quite a k*ll actually. I just couldn't stand the idea that you might regret, someday, giving this boat away.
LUKE: Even though I said I wanted it gone?
LORELAI: Yes, I know, but you were upset.
LUKE: No, I was cranky. Now, I'm upset.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, I just thought --
LUKE: You thought about you. You thought about you and how you'd feel. You didn't think about me or the fact that I said I wanted to get rid of this damn boat. I mean I said it, Lorelai. I said it, you heard it and you ignored it.
LORELAI: Because I didn't want you to --
LUKE: You have no respect for what I wanted! This was my dad. This was his boat and this decision was mine. This was not yours!
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: This is who I am. I don't want to hang onto things or stare at things.
LORELAI: Except my horoscope, which is absolutely the wrong thing to bring up right now. I'm sorry.
LUKE: I'm getting out of here.
LORELAI: No, I'm sorry. Please, just stay and yell at me.
LUKE: Why? What's the point? You don't listen to anything I say, anyhow.
[Luke exits.]
CUT TO YALE - OUTSIDE A BAR
[Rory and Marty exit a bar]
RORY: She's nowhere!
MARTY: She not nowhere.
RORY: This is all my fault!
MARTY: Well, there's more bars. We'll find her.
RORY: God, I'm so stupid. If I didn't have to confront Logan like that, I wouldn't have had to send her off on her own and we wouldn't be looking for her right now.
MARTY: We'll find her.
RORY: He's so frustrating, that guy. I mean, I don't know what I did to get on his bad side or why he just has to come after me.
MARTY: Oh, stop it!
RORY: What?
MARTY: He's not coming after you. He likes you.
RORY: He does not.
MARTY: [annoyed] Oh, please, Rory.
RORY: Marty, he does not like me. I mean, look at what he did. Look at that stunt he pulled. He totally humiliated me.
MARTY: Attention like that from people like Logan is like being tapped. You've been anointed. You're in.
RORY: In what?
MARTY: In with him, with his group. He likes you. Stop being so naive. Its annoying.
RORY: Marty. [Rory's phone rings]
RORY: Hello?
CUT TO CHILTON - HEADMASTER CHARLESTON'S OFFICE
[Scene switches between Yale and Chilton]
HDM. CHARLESTON: Ms. Gilmore, Headmaster Charleston here.
RORY: Oh. Hi, Headmaster Charleston. What's going on?
HDM. CHARLESTON: Well, not much. Thank you for asking. I was just wondering how things were going with Ms. Fairchild?
RORY: Oh, fine.
HDM. CHARLESTON: Yes?
RORY: Everythings great.
HDM. CHARLESTON: Wonderful. Then, I can inform Anna's parents that the underage girl the Yale campus police found when they broke up a rather raucous party is, in fact, not their daughter.
RORY: I'm sorry, Headmaster Charleston.
HDM. CHARLESTON: And what a help that is.
RORY: I tried. I just -- I turned around for a moment. Did she tell you about the bench? We spent a lot of time --
HDM. CHARLESTON: I'm sorry, Ms. Gilmore. I have to go. Some angry parents will be here any moment to talk to me. I appreciate the attempt. Good luck at Yale.
RORY: [b*at] Bye, Headmaster Charleston. [hangs up] The campus police got her. She came, she spent one day with me, and she got sent home by police. And I think I'm going to retroactively flunk high school.
MARTY: At least she's safe, right?
RORY: Right. Crappy, crappy day. You want to take a cab? My treat. [They walk to a cab. Marty opens the door] Thanks. [Rory gets in, but Marty stops]
MARTY: I think I'm gonna walk.
RORY: Marty . . .
MARTY: I'll -- I'll see you tomorrow.
[Marty shuts the door and walks away as Rory watches]
CUT TO MISS PATTY'S
[Lots of people are there, dressed up and socializing. Lorelai is sniffing her hand.]
SOOKIE: What are you doing?
LORELAI: I smell like trees.
SOOKIE: You do? [Sniffs Lorelai's hand]
LORELAI: Mm-hmm.
SOOKIE: [sniffs her own hand] Hey, me too!
LORELAI: Now we're the crazy, pine-scented ladies.
SOOKIE: How's your punch?
LORELAI: It's good. [Lorelai looks distant.]
SOOKIE: You ok?
LORELAI: Yeah, fine. Just fine.
[Miss Patty gets on stage as people applaud]
MISS PATTY: Thank you. Thank you, everyone. I'm honored that you came here to help me celebrate 40 wonderful years on the stage. It feels so good to be here in front of an audience and so close to a piano. [Repeats, louder] So close to a piano. Kirk!
KIRK: [looking up from a book] Sorry. [loudly] Hey, Patty, why don't you do a little something for us?
MISS PATTY: Well, if you insist. Hit it!
[Salsa begins on the piano. Miss Patty plays maracas and Kirk plays a glockenspiel]
MISS PATTY: [singing] Way down among Brazilians, coffee beans grow by the million.
So they have to find those extra cups to fill.
They got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.
You can't get cherry soda, cause they have to fill their quota.
And the way things are, I bet they never will.
LORELAI: [seeing Luke standing outside the window] I'll be right back.
MISS PATTY: [singing] They got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil.
CUT TO MISS PATTY'S - STEPS OUTSIDE
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: See there's a reason I stay away from people on this particular day. It's because I suck.
LORELAI: Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry. I should've listened to you. I should've stayed out of it. You were right. I didn't think. I mean I didn't think like you would think. I thought like I would think and my thinking is sometimes very, very wrong if you're not me. And occasionally if you are me --
[Lukes kisses her, interrupting]
LUKE: You keep thinking like you'd think.
LORELAI: I can do that. Do you want to come in? You can get drunk just standing next to the punch bowl.
LUKE: No, I'm still kinda --
LORELAI: I get it.
LUKE: I just didn't want us to --
LORELAI: We're not.
LUKE: Yeah, you go have a good time.
LORELAI: See you tomorrow.
LUKE: Yeah, you'll see me tomorrow.
[They kiss. Luke walks away while Lorelai watches]
CUT TO GILMORE RESIDENCE - LORELAI'S GARAGE
[Luke walks in and looks at the boat. He rubs his hand along side of it, thinking]
CUT TO YALE - OUTSIDE COURTYARD
[Logan is standing with Finn and Colin, drinking coffee.]
RICHARD: Logan
LOGAN: Huh? Richard? Wow, this a pleasant surprise. Finn, Colin, you know Richard don't you?
RICHARD: Well, my boys, nice to see you. Logan, I wanted to talk to you. I just heard about the incident.
LOGAN: The?
RICHARD: I heard that you professed your feelings for Rory.
LOGAN: [confused] What?
RICHARD: Mr. Bell is a very dear friend of mine. As is the Dean of Admissions. Well, you know this place. News travels fast.
LOGAN: Yeah, look . . .
RICHARD: I have to tell you that while I understand what could have driven you to such a public display of affection, there is a proper time and place for that sort of thing. And a classroom in the middle of class is not one of them.
LOGAN: No, I know. I --
RICHARD: However, what's done is done. It's out. So I've dropped by to tell you that I've spoken to your father.
[Colin and Finn look at each other.]
LOGAN: My father?
RICHARD: We pounded out a few things. Property agreements, pre-nups, that sort of thing.
LOGAN: Ok, I think there's been . . .
RICHARD: Oh, we came to a very fair agreement. I'm sure you'll be pleased. Now, we're setting up a dinner for next week to finalize the engagement and start talking about the ceremony. Emily is handling all the newspaper announcements, so not to worry. That's all taken care of.
LOGAN: But --
RICHARD: She is a fine young lady, Logan. I want her to be happy. You'll take care of that, I assume. All right, I'll let you get back to your coffee break. Nice seeing all of you again. And Logan, welcome to the family, son.
[Richard walks away, touching his nose. Rory, hidden, signals back, touching her nose]
CUT TO YALE - INSIDE VESTIBULE
[Rory runs up to Richard, excited.]
RICHARD: I do hope one of his dopey-looking friends knows CPR or he just might not make it.
RORY: You're the best, Grandpa.
RICHARD: All right, who's next? Is Paris giving you any trouble?
RORY: Not any more than usual. However, there is a girl in my Modern Poetry class who keeps kicking my chair.
[They begin walking down the hall]
RICHARD: Ah, I do love this place.
RORY: Right back at you, Grandpa.
[Fade out.]

LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke and Lorelai are asleep. Lorelai wakes up and leans toward Luke.]
LORELAI: Hey. Wake up.
LUKE: Huh?
LORELAI: Wake up.
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Come on, you're missing it.
LUKE: Is "it" sleep? 'Cause you'd be right.
LORELAI: Smell the air. Smell it.
[She pulls the blankets off him.]
LUKE: It smells cold.
LORELAI: Come on.
LUKE: What? No, it's freezing.
LORELAI: Come on!
[She pulls him out of bed.]
LUKE [grunting]: The floor's cold.
LORELAI: Geez, you're so obsessed with the cold.
LUKE: Because it's cold!
LORELAI: I know.
[Luke growls.]
LORELAI [mimicking]: Grumble, grumble.
[She leads him out the door.]
STAR'S HOLLOW STREET - OUTSIDE LUKE'S
[Lorelai walks to the middle of the street and stops. Luke follows grudgingly.]
LUKE: I'm turning numb.
LORELAI: Keep moving.
LUKE: Are my feet still attached to my body or did they snap off coming down the stairs?
LORELAI [looks]: They're still there.
LUKE: Why are we out here?
LORELAI: Take a deep breath.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Do it.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I smell snow.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: It's coming. I always know. I can smell it, and I'm never wrong.
LUKE: It wasn't in the forecast.
LORELAI [sighs happily]: It's just my favorite time of the year. The whole world changes color.
LUKE: I think I'm blacking out.
LORELAI: Flakes, flurries, swirls, crystals, whatever form it comes in. I'll take it. We go back, snow and me. We have a beautiful history.
LUKE: Saw two forecasts, there was no mention of snow. Cold, but no snow.
LORELAI: Sleigh rides, ice skating, snowball fights. I'll even take curling. God, I love curling!
LUKE: Lance Cranston on Channel 6 said it would be dry. Kimmy Liston, Live at 5, same thing. No snow, nothing.
LORELAI: Hot cocoa, hot toddies. Best time of the year!
LUKE: Jimmy Mountain in Accu-Chopper One said it would be weeks before -
[He stops and looks up as the snow starts to fall.]
LUKE: Lance and Kimmy are idiots.
LORELAI: Welcome, friend.
LUKE: I'm going inside now.
LORELAI: But -
LUKE: One more whiff, and then so are you.
LORELAI: Luke -
[Luke pulls away and walks back into the diner. Lorelai smiles as she looks up at the snow falling.]
[Opening credits.]
LUKE'S DINER
[A group of town men are sitting around a table.]
ANDREW: Streetwalker.
TAYLOR: Too urban.
MAN #1: Concubine.
MAN #2: Seems high-falutin.
REVEREND: Anyone seen Farewell My Concubine? Beautiful film. Gorgeous cinematography.
TAYLOR: I'm surprised you see such adult fare, Reverend.
REVEREND: Well, do you picture me watching Sound of Music every night, Taylor? Gag me.
[Luke comes over with a coffee pot.]
MAN #2: Scarlet woman.
TAYLOR: I like it.
ANDREW: Too Nathaniel Hawthorne.
LUKE: Who?
ANDREW: Read a book.
MAN #1: Harlot.
MAN #2: Naw.
REVEREND: Woman of accomadating morals.
MAN #1: Too long
ANDREW: Hot mutton.
TAYLOR: I wouldn't know where to begin.
LUKE: What are you guys doing?
TAYLOR: Well, the first snow has come along, Luke, and with the first snow comes the town's Revolutionary w*r Re-enactment.
LUKE: Always a heel-clicking good time.
TAYLOR: Oh, well, we've got a big surprise for everybody this year.
LUKE: Great, I'll pretend I'm interested.
REVEREND: It's a big deal, Luke.
LUKE: Yeah, it's the same thing every year, Reverend. You guys re-enact the time a bunch of pig-headed morons stood outside all night in the freezing snow waiting for a battle that never happened.
MAN #1: This year is different, crank.
TAYLOR: A local historian uncovered new evidence of Star's Hollow's participation in the Revolution. Apparently, an English battalion was awaiting the return of their commanding general with plans for a big battle. Our soldiers caught wind of this and blocked the high road so that the general had to travel by the lower road, through town, to reach his troops.
LUKE: So, they kidnapped him.
[The men laugh.]
TAYLOR: No, they were much slyer than that. They had a brave lady of the town use her wiles to draw the general to her rooms and keep him occupied. That delayed the general's arrival which allowed Lafayette the opportunity to ambush the waiting British troops.
LUKE: A hooker stopped a battle.
MAN #2: We're not calling her a hooker.
REVEREND: It's too "Baretta".
MAN #1: That's what we're doing now, trying to figure out what the hell to call her.
ANDREW: Bit of stuff.
MAN #1: Too Monty Python.
TAYLOR: This new re-enactment is going to be a huge boost to tourism, Luke. The local press is all excited to cover it.
LUKE: Well then they're very easily amused.
TAYLOR: Got a big casting session soon to pick the lucky townswoman to play our special lady.
MAN #2: She should be thin.
ANDREW: But not too thin.
MAN #1: Know anybody who fits the bill?
LUKE: Not off-hand, but if I run into any moderately-weighted whores in my travels, I'll let you know.
[He returns to the counter as Lorelai comes down the stairs.
TAYLOR: Well, Patty is ready to go...
LORELAI: Morning.
LUKE: Good morning again.
LORELAI: Oh, cool, the re-enactors are meeting. Another wonderful by-product of snow.
LUKE: Oh, yes, they're cooking up something very special. You want coffee?
LORELAI: No. I'm late, so I'll just grab it at the inn. I'm actually looking forward to having my first cup of joe in my new, snow covered inn and - why are the re-enactors staring at me?
LUKE: You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
LORELAI: The Reverend is blushing. Why is he blushing?
LUKE: I'd walk out of here is I was you. And try not to walk too sexy.
LORELAI: Okay. You'll explain that to me later?
LUKE: I'd enjoy that.
LORELAI: Okay. [She walks by the table.] Hi, guys.
REVEREND [To the others]: Pretty lady.
ANDREW: Too thin.
MAN #2: This is not about your taste, Andrew.
ANDREW: I'm going for historical accuracy's side. Women were heavier back then.
MAN #1: How about your wife?
MAN #2: You want a sock in the nose?
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE
{Emily is walking through the house talking on a cordless phone.]
EMILY: No, no, Jean, that works perfectly with my schedule. It's been forever since we've seen each other. [pause] Oh, I'd love that! Mirabelle is still one of my favorite – oh!
[She jumps back, shocked to see a shivering little white dog sitting outside.]
EMILY: Oh my God! Oh my God! No, uh, Jean, hang on a second, will you?
[She pushes a button on the phone. Richard's cell phone rings. He picks it up. Scene cuts between the pool house and the main house.]
RICHARD: Hello?
EMILY: There's a dog on the patio!
RICHARD: What? Emily?
EMILY: Of course it's Emily!
RICHARD: I'm sorry. You sound agitated.
EMILY: Did you get a dog?
RICHARD: Certainly not!
EMILY: Well, there's a dog on the patio.
RICHARD: Well, where are you?
EMILY: Inside! Richard, do something!
RICHARD: I can't see it from here.
EMILY: Well, he's here nonetheless, and he's looking at me! Richard, the dog is looking at me!
RICHARD: Hold on.
EMILY: I'm holding, but what are we going to – Richard? [To the dog] Shoo! Shoo!
[Richard is out on the patio. They continue to talk on the phone.]
EMILY: Now do you believe me?
RICHARD: Well, I wasn't doubting you, Emily, I just couldn't see it.
EMILY [pointing at the fire poker in his hand]: What is that?
RICHARD: Oh, you made it sound like it was a rabid beast, so I came prepared.
EMILY: Don't get too close.
RICHARD: I don't see any froth on his mouth.
EMILY: Well, that's something.
RICHARD: I see a collar but no tags. That isn't very smart.
EMILY: You're getting too close.
RICHARD: Well, what should I do? It's freezing out here. We can't let it roam around.
EMILY: Well it can't come into the house.
RICHARD: Why someone would fail to put a tag on a dog –
EMILY: Take it to the pool house.
RICHARD: What? Why?
EMILY: Well, that's why we have it.
RICHARD: We have a pool house for stray dogs? Love the innuendo, Emily. Fine. I will take him into the pool house.
EMILY: Thank you, Richard. I came out and he was just sitting there.
RICHARD: It's a he?
EMILY: I don't know.
RICHARD: Well, I can't get a visual from this angle.
EMILY: It's not important.
RICHARD: Dog! I want you to come with me. Come along, dog!
[The dog gets up and follows Richard to the pool house.]
EMILY: He's following you.
RICHARD: Seems to be working!
EMILY: Good job, Richard!
INDEPENDENCE INN
[Lorelai comes in the front door.]
LORELAI: Hey! You know who just nipped at my nose? Jack Frost.
MICHEL: Huh. You know who just nipped at my ear? Jack I-Don't-Care.
LORELAI: Look outside, Michel. It's the first time we've seen the Inn blanketed by snow. It's like a postcard.
MICHEL: I know. I haven't been this excited since Madonna just dropped by Total Request Live.
LORELAI: The floor's a little wet, are we getting the mats out?
MICHEL: We are without mats.
LORELAI: That's impossible, we ordered them eight months ago. We got confirmation.
MICHEL: They were back-ordered and due within two weeks. Two weeks turned into eight months, and all we have to show for it is our special yellow back-order receipt. Such cheap paper they use at the mat place. That should have been a clue.
LORELAI: What else can we put down?
MICHEL: Oh, plenty. I saw two movies over the weekend. They were both awful.
LORELAI: No, I meant put down on the floor so our guests don't slip and fall. We have to find something.
MICHEL: The good news is that there will be less people here who could possibly slip.
[They walk over to the reception desk.]
LORELAI: What do you mean, less people?
MICHEL: We've had four cancellations in the last hour.
LORELAI: Why? What happened?
MICHEL: All due to snow.
LORELAI: Snow? Our beautiful snow?
MICHEL: People say it is cold, the streets are bad –
LORELAI: The streets are fine. They're plowing away out there. A graceful, gorgeous plow was pushing the snowy white out of the street right behind me, it was beautiful.
MICHEL: They wanted nice weather.
LORELAI: This is nice weather. It's classic Connecticut inn weather. It's all the more reason to come.
MICHEL: I would advise that you change our cancellation policy. These people cancel and have to pay nothing.
LORELAI: I hate charging people for canceling. It's too corporate. We're doing things differently here.
MICHEL: Oh, yes. Bankruptcy will be fun and different. Be sure to file for it while it's snowing, won't you? We'll go down to bankruptcy court in a horse-drawn sleigh.
LORELAI [sighs]: Try to find mats.
MICHEL: I'll do what I can.
[Lorelai walks into the kitchen.]
LORELAI: Hey, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Good morning.
LORELAI: How are you loving our winter wonderland?
SOOKIE: My car wouldn't start this morning.
LORELAI: Oh, drag.
SOOKIE: And we're almost completely out of coffee.
LORELAI: Oh, well. So, make some more.
SOOKIE: I mean out, out. There's no more on the premises.
LORELAI: You're kidding.
SOOKIE: I wish I was.
LORELAI: But there's mounds of it stacked in the walk-in. Heroin-sniffing dogs get all excited and confused when they go in there.
SOOKIE: Why do they get all excited and confused?
LORELAI: Because you smuggle heroin in coffee.
SOOKIE [gasps]: No, I don't!
LORELAI: It was in Beverly Hills Cop, remember? The heroin in the coffee? Why are you taking everything so literally?
SOOKIE [whining]: My car wouldn't start!
LORELAI: Since when does that make you take things literally?
SOOKIE: Wait, I'm sorry, when were there dogs in the walk-in?
LORELAI: I'm just saying, we had a lot of coffee. Until now, apparently.
SOOKIE: ‘Cause we're switching suppliers. I found that new blend, you remember? You tasted it, you said it tasted great.
LORELAI: I liked it. I remember.
[She pours herself some coffee.]
SOOKIE: So I'm letting the old stuff run out because the new stuff's coming in but the new stuff is back-ordered, so it never came in.
LORELAI: Well, send out for more, immediately.
MICHEL [interrupting]: Not possible.
LORELAI: Why?
MICHEL: Remember those wonderful snowplows you were writing a sonnet to not five minutes ago? Well, one of them dumped a ten-foot mountain of snow in our driveway. There is no getting in or out.
LORELAI: Unbelievable.
MICHEL: Well, it's not so bad, because with the cancellations, no one's coming today anyway.
LORELAI: Yes, but we have to get out, to go home, eventually, and to get coffee now. So start the guys digging.
MICHEL: You mean I should get the one guy who did not call in sick because of the snow and the cold to get digging?
LORELAI: Yes, get him digging! [Michel goes.] It's okay, it's all good. Snow will be dug and mats will be found, coffee will be bought, everything's good.
SOOKIE: By the way.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: There are some people out there eating breakfast, and –
LORELAI: And –
SOOKIE: And they're drinking coffee. [She takes the coffee cup from Lorelai and heads for the dining room.] Customers.
YALE DORMS - RORY'S COMMON ROOM
[Rory comes out of her room. Paris is on the couch.]
RORY: Good morning.
PARIS: Stupid C-span.
RORY: What?
PARIS: Stupid C-span's had me on hold forever and I've got to get going.
RORY: Well, you're not the only one who calls C-span, Paris.
PARIS: Right. There are a lot of us. Like the guy who asked the question about Iran's long-range m*ssile production and nuclear capacity, then shouted Ba Ba Booie! Him they put on. Me they've got twiddling my thumbs.
[Paris goes into her room. Rory opens the door; Christopher is standing there.]
RORY: Dad.
CHRIS: Hey, kiddo.
RORY: What are you doing here?
CHRIS: Aw, I was just in the neighborhood, I thought I'd look you up.
RORY: Did you bring the baby?
CHRIS: Baby's getting spoiled by her grandma. So where are you headed?
RORY: I have class.
CHRIS: Right. College. Classes. I've seen Oxford Blues, I should have put that together. So this is your place, huh?
RORY: Yeah. It's a little messy right now. [Paris walks out of her room.] That's Paris.
CHRIS: We've met. Hi, Paris.
PARIS: Hello. [On the phone] Yeah, I've got a suggestion for getting you guys out of the ratings basement. And putting me on hold is not one of them.
RORY: So, you were just passing through?
CHRIS: Yeah, I was in the area, or the area near the area, so how about breakfast?
RORY: Oh, I don't have time.
CHRIS: It's the most important meal of the day.
RORY: And the most skipped around here. Mornings are busy.
CHRIS: Forget busy. Forget class. Play hooky, have breakfast with me. Come on. We can all go together if you want. Paris?
PARIS: I am kind of hungry. And C-span can kiss my ass.
CHRIS: Okay, then, we're on.
RORY: Dad –
CHRIS: We can walk, we can drive, whatever –
RORY: Dad, no! I have to go. I can't be any clearer, okay?
[She leaves Chris standing at the door and walks down the hall.]
CHRIS: Rory –
INDEPENDENCE INN - LOBBY
[Lorelai is on the phone.]
LORELAI: Well, we can certainly rebook you, because we'd love to have you come anytime. Really. But if you reconsidered your cancellation and came in now you would find nothing less than a magical wonderland. A snowy xanadu of goodness. Really. Bing Crosby's warming up his pipes over by the fireplace. Magical. [Pause] Mm-hm. Yes, driving in the snow is tricky. [Pause] No, I don't think I could get Bing Crosby to come pick you up. [Pause] Okay. Well, just check your calendar and call me back, and I'll be here to rearrange it. Thank you. Bye.
[She walks toward the dining room as Michel enters wearing a furry hat and carrying a shovel. She nearly slips on the wet floor.]
MICHEL [laughing]: That was very graceful.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm desperate for those mats.
MICHEL: I had been working on the mats but you asked me to shovel the snow. And now I have a blister, a muscle spasm and a neck crick and I have a date tonight, and a crick will cramp my kissing move.
[They go into the dining room. Lorelai clears dishes while Michel removes his outerwear.]
LORELAI: Well, I appreciate your effort.
MICHEL: Are you being sarcastic?
LORELAI: Just a tiny bit.
MICHEL: You know that I am light-boned and cannot take physical exertion. I work with my mind.
LORELAI: Well, you're excused from shoveling duty, just focus on the mats.
MICHEL: We have another problem. The Goldfarbs are missing.
LORELAI: The Goldfarbs? Our Goldfarbs?
MICHEL: The ones you recommended to go cross-country skiing this morning.
LORELAI: Right. So they're out skiing.
MICHEL: They said they would be back by noon promptly. Well, it's past noon, and their friends are here to meet them for lunch, but the Goldfarbs are erwol.
LORELAI: They're what?
MICHEL: Erwol! Erwol!
LORELAI: Oh! AWOL.
MICHEL: What do I care. I'm French. The point is, we strapped wooden sticks to the feet of a fat orthodontist and a woman with ugly chunky jewelry, and we lost them.
LORELAI: Oh my God, it's only noon!
MICHEL: Can I call the authorities?
LORELAI: You think we're there already?
[Sookie comes out with a bussing tray to pick up the dishes.]
SOOKIE: What are you doing?
LORELAI: Cleaning up. [To Michel] No, let's wait another twenty minutes, just keep calling their cell phone.
MICHEL: Oh, joy.
[Lorelai pours a bit of coffee from one cup into another.]
SOOKIE: Ugh! Please tell me you're not doing what I think you're doing.
LORELAI: What? I'm just cleaning up. We're short-handed today. Go about your business.
SOOKIE [disgusted]: You were pouring leftover coffee from other people's cups into your own cup and now you're going to drink it!
LORELAI: No, no, no!
SOOKIE [grabbing]: Give me that cup!
LORELAI: No! Get away! Don't you understand if I don't get coffee in me, things are going to get ugly around here!
SOOKIE: Going to get?
MICHEL: Be very careful! She's near a knife!
SOOKIE [obtains the cup]: Give me that. I'm ashamed of you.
LORELAI: I'm ashamed of me too.
SOOKIE: If that wasn't a cry for help, huh.
LORELAI: I'm going out.
MICHEL: The driveway's still blocked.
LORELAI: On foot.
MICHEL: The snow is soft and four feet deep.
LORELAI: I'm cross-country skiing for coffee.
MICHEL: The Goldfarbs have the skis!
LORELAI: I'm going out and I'm bringing back coffee!
MICHEL: Be careful of the floor!
[We hear Lorelai slip and squeal. Another woman cries out.]
LORELAI [OS]: Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. We're getting mats, I swear. Have a nice day.
ELDER GILMORE POOL HOUSE
[Emily knocks on the door. Richard answers.]
RICHARD: Emily. Hello.
EMILY: Hello. I saw your car in the driveway and was just wondering if everything was okay.
RICHARD: Everything's fine. Thank you. I've put off my morning appointments to sort of stabilize the canine situation. She's been fairly calm.
EMILY: Oh, it's a she?
RICHARD: That has been ascertained.
EMILY: And there's no I.D. tag?
RICHARD: A gross oversight of its owners. I found its exact breed, though, which may come in handy.
EMILY: Oh, wonderful!
RICHARD: Let me, uh, bring up the website. [He sits down at the computer.] "Dog Breed 411 dot com".
EMILY: Isn't that clever? It's amazing the information available on the computer these days.
RICHARD: Oh, it's wonderful. There are websites you'd be interested in, too.
EMILY: Oh, I wouldn't know how.
RICHARD: Oh, it's easy. Whatever you're interested in, you just type it in - the DAR, or Louis Vuitton, Franz Schubert - and you're off and running.
EMILY: That easy?
RICHARD: That easy.
EMILY: There she is!
RICHARD: Mmm. A long-haired Jack Russell terrier.
EMILY: I'll start calling the neighbors and tell them we have a long-haired Jack Russell terrier.
RICHARD: A female.
EMILY: What's all that luggage?
RICHARD: Ah, that is the Louis Vuitton website. [He gets up to let her sit.] I thought you might like to peruse it.
EMILY [sitting down]: Isn't that something?
RICHARD: You use that mouse there to move around.
EMILY: A mouse? How fun!
YALE CLASSROOM
[The students are seated at a large round table.]
PROFESSOR: That was David Hume. A personal favorite, and I'm not saying that because Hume was Scottish and my mother's maiden name is McCammon. Okay, more on the principles of morals, and perhaps why Scots rule, next time we're together. Have a good day. [The students begin collecting their things.] And read! Read!
[Rory walks out into the hallway. Christopher is waiting with a cup of coffee.]
RORY: Still here?
[They walk together, Chris following a few steps behind Rory.]
CHRIS: Still here. This is for you. Coffee. It might be a little cold. Teachers sure talk a lot here at Yale. No bells. Don't they have bells?
RORY: Nope. Thanks for this. [gestures to the coffee.]
CHRIS: You're welcome. [Pause] Look, Rory, that manic, desperate guy that came down to your dorm room this morning, he left. He's gone, and I'm not going to bug you anymore, okay?
RORY: Okay.
CHRIS: I didn't think it through, and I feel pretty dumb coming down here like this. I just have to say, though, that I hate our relationship, okay? I hate it. This wall, this stupid wall, it sucks. And I put it there, but I wanted to try and do something about it, but I got a little desperate, and I'm sorry.
RORY: It's okay.
CHRIS: I've been in Hartford a lot. My dad's sick. My mom's with the baby and I've had time to think, and maybe that's not good, but my dad and I, we always had that wall, you know? And, God, for us to be that way, like my dad and me? I – I don't want you visiting me when I'm old and cranky and you feel like you have to. I want you to visit now and I want you to want to. Look, I'm not going to bother you anymore. This wasn't fair for me to do this, surprising you like this. It wasn't fair. Uh –
[He digs in his pocket and hands her some cream and sugar.]
CHRIS: Here. I didn't know how you take your coffee so I got you everything. I'll see you, kid.
[He leaves.]
RORY: Bye.
[She turns the other way.]
MISS PATTY'S STUDIO - EXTERIOR
[A sign is propped up: "Girl" auditions 4:00. The camera cuts inside. Several ladies are sitting in a row wearing large number signs. Taylor walks around them.]
TAYLOR: This is not just an historic re-enactment, ladies. This is an historic moment unto itself. This will be the first time that a member of our fairer sex has participated in Stars Hollow's Revolutionary w*r Re-enactment.
KIRK: Lulu is fully aware of the historical significance of this, Taylor. She's bright and sexy, I'll tell you that now.
TAYLOR: All right. My point is that this will be the first vital role a woman has played in our re-enactment. And you should know that it is of a sensitive nature, so if you're overly sensitive you may want to back out now.
[He goes to sit at a judge's table with Miss Patty. She is hiding her face with her hand.]
KIRK: Lulu's as insensitive as they come, Taylor.
TAYLOR [impatient]: Fine, Kirk. Thank you. Now we've little time and we have to choose the right girl quickly. Stand up, please, all of you.
[The ladies stand up excitedly.]
TAYLOR: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. All right. Based on the visual that we're looking for I must now eliminate numbers two, five, seven and nine. Thank you for coming. [The eliminated ladies leave.] Now, I need to see a demonstration of your acting abilities. Please give me your best "come hither" look.
[The remaining ladies try to look seductive.]
TAYLOR: Your… "come hither" looks, ladies?
LADY #4: That was my "come hither" look.
TAYLOR [frustrated]: Girls, girls! You're supposed to be seducing a man. Now picture, on horseback, a dashing, finely accoutered gentleman, firm of jaw and solid of build –
PATTY: I thought you were doing it, Taylor.
TAYLOR: I am – oh! [laughs] You with your funny jokes.
PATTY [laughing]: Yes. Me and my jokes.
TAYLOR: Four and eight, you may go.
KIRK: Yes!
PATTY: Taylor, isn't eight your sister's kid?
TAYLOR: Mm-hmm. Yes, little Debbie.
PATTY: And you were coaching her to – I mean, you had her – never mind.
TAYLOR: Let's try the look again, girls. You're being seductive.
[Kirk stands behind the judge's table and coaches Lulu.]
PATTY: Oh, Kirk, don't be a pageant mom.
TAYLOR: I can't tell in these outfits. You're all so heavily dressed.
LULU: It's cold outside.
TAYLOR: The young heroine of our story didn't think of the cold when she gave up her greatest treasure for her country.
KIRK: Lulu's got a bunch of hot outfits, Taylor. I can put her in something.
TAYLOR: Not necessary. Number one? Thank you for coming. [He gestures to the door.]
LADY #1 [pouting]: Rats.
[Taylor opens the door to the studio to let her out. Just then Lorelai walks by.]
TAYLOR: Oh! Lorelai!
LORELAI: Hey, Taylor.
TAYLOR: How would you like to play our woman of easy virtue?
LORELAI: What?
TAYLOR: This is a straight offer, no audition necessary.
LORELAI: Oh, well, it's the best offer I've gotten all day, Taylor, but unfortunately I'd have to – ah! Ah!
[She shrieks as she steps in a puddle.]
TAYLOR: Is that a yes or a no?
LORELAI: It's a no, thank you.
TAYLOR: The level of commitment in this town is stunningly low.
[Lorelai limps toward Luke's.]
TAYLOR: All right, girls, let's see your sexy walk.
LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai opens the door. Luke is behind the counter. ]
LORELAI: Warmth!
LUKE: What are you doing?
LORELAI: The icicle foot. It's the latest dance craze, all the hip kids are doing it.
LUKE: Your shoe's all wet.
LORELAI: Oh, this evil puddle was lying in wait. Evil, evil!
LUKE: Let me get you a towel.
LORELAI: Oh, forget the foot. I need caffeine. Whatever form you've got, I haven't had any all day. I'll drink it, sh**t it, eat it, snort it, whatever form it's in, gimme.
LUKE: Should I bother to ask how your day's going?
LORELAI: Oh, terrif! My shoe's an icicle, the Inn's driveway is snowed in and we lost the Goldfarbs.
LUKE: Who are the Goldfarbs?
LORELAI: The two guests who bothered to show up. I sent them skiing and I k*ll them.
LUKE: You k*ll your guests?
LORELAI: Eh, well, you know what happens.
LUKE [handing her a coffee]: Here.
LORELAI: The only bright side of my day is being asked to be a prostitute.
LUKE: That's something to cling to.
LORELAI [sipping, then crying out]: Oh, hot! Warn me!
LUKE: Coffee's hot? Sorry. Coffee's hot.
KIRK [bursting into the diner]: My girlfriend's the whore! My girlfriend's the whore! Woohoo! Yeah!
[He leaves just as suddenly.]
LORELAI [holding her tongue]: Great, now I'm not even the town whore.
LUKE: Well, if you like, I'll leave a little something on the dresser for you tonight.
LORELAI: It couldn't hurt.
LUKE: Here. Ice cube.
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE
[Emily sits at the table, making calls.]
EMILY: Well, it would help to just put the word out there that we have a dog. In case anyone hears of anyone looking for one. [Pause] That's right. A white long-haired Jack Russell terrier. [Richard enters.] Thank you, Margaret. I'll be here all day. Bye.
RICHARD: Margaret. Whitson?
EMILY: I figured a call to the neighborhood busybody was the first order of business. How's it doing?
RICHARD: Well, it seems to be asleep now, but I am lacking a proper bowl for its food.
EMILY: I think I can help you with that, follow me.
[They walk into the kitchen.]
EMILY: What are you feeding it?
RICHARD: I've got some leftover stew. I'm going to pick chunks of meat out of it.
EMILY: Stew? Richard, tell me that that man of yours isn't feeding you stew?
RICHARD: Well, he probably offered. He said it was a recipe passed down by some dead relative.
EMILY: Stew? That may be what k*ll his relative.
RICHARD [laughs]: I didn't think of it.
EMILY: Promise me you'll make him prepare proper food for you. Please. That's what he's paid for.
RICHARD: I promise, Emily.
[Emily pulls a china bowl out of the cupboard.]
EMILY: Here we go.
RICHARD: Ah, looks perfect.
EMILY: And it's chipped, so just toss it when you're done.
RICHARD: Thank you, Emily.
EMILY: You're welcome.
RICHARD: And the stew is history.
EMILY: Good.
[Richard nods, then leaves. Emily smiles after him.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is sewing a costume and talking on the phone.]
LORELAI: From what I can gather, this woman made eyes at a British general, and the British general was feeling a little randy.



[Scene cuts from Rory's dorm to Lorelai's living room.]
RORY: Such a salacious history our town has.
LORELAI: And she led him into her house and kept the fellow occupied.
RORY: Occupied his brains out, huh?
LORELAI: Hey, don't warp the loo.
RORY: Sorry.
LORELAI: But why do you think they didn't just k*ll him?
RORY: I don't know, maybe they knew that we would ultimately make peace with England and they wouldn't want to k*ll a potential great-great-grandfather of a Winston Churchill or a Benny Hill.
LORELAI: Well, that was very forward-thinking of them. [Examining the dress] Boy, do I know how to dress a slut or what? I am very proud.
RORY: So you haven't said anything about our first snow.
LORELAI: That's right, I haven't.
RORY: Why? You don't sound so excited.
LORELAI: Snow and I had a bit of a bumpy ride today.
RORY: Bummer.
LORELAI: I blame myself. I may have been too needy with snow. Too clingy. So it had no choice but to push me away, create a boundary.
RORY: Snow and men have a lot in common.
LORELAI: What about you? Anything exciting happen today? You get in a snowball fight with a Nobel Prize winner or something?
RORY: No, no. Nothing out of the ordinary. But I'm sorry that snow was so mean to you today.
LORELAI: Oh, it's okay. It wasn't snow's fault. We had one bad day. Every relationship has its bad days. It doesn't mean you drop and run, you keep going, right? Peaks and valleys keep a relationship fresh.
RORY: I agree.
LORELAI: Tomorrow is another day.
[She changes the buckets where water is dripping from the ceiling. She looks up at the leak and sighs.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – OUTSIDE – MORNING
[Lorelai comes out of the house and locks the door. She begins to walk toward the Jeep, then stops. The Jeep is buried in a pile of snow.]
LORELAI: No.
[As she watches, a branch from the tree above the Jeep falls onto it, bringing more snow down.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – OUTSIDE – LATER ON
[Luke is helping Lorelai dig out her Jeep. Lorelai is pushing snow off the hood with her hands.]
LUKE: Don't do that.
LORELAI: I want it gone, gone!
LUKE: I'm getting it gone.
LORELAI: But this is personal. I'm physically hurting the snow as I dig at it. I'm chopping into its stupid white face with my razor sharp fingernail claws and I'm delighting in it! I want it to suffer!
LUKE: You look deranged.
LORELAI: Take that. Argh, and that!
LUKE: Why did you park it under a tree?
LORELAI: I have been parking this stupid car under this stupid tree forever!
LUKE: But it's snowing.
LORELAI: Yes! But snow has always protected me before. It's been a white blanket of love! We had a symbiotic thing going on!
LUKE: Snow cannot protect you. Snow is frozen water falling out of the sky. And as for this car and this tree, you can predict it. It's gravity. There's four tons of snow on this tree. You park under it, gravity is going to come into play and take it out! It's basic physics!
LORELAI: I do not need a physics lesson right now, no matter how well it's intentioned!
LUKE: Sorry.
LORELAI: It's over. Oh, yes, it is over! [She takes a violent swipe at the snow on the Jeep.]
LUKE: What is?
LORELAI: Me and snow. We're through!
LUKE: No, you're not!
LORELAI: It was years of bliss, you know? We had some good stuff, and good times. I could show you pictures of the snow angels I made. But I am done. Done!
LUKE: Well, let it down easy, okay?
LORELAI: Oh! And I am changing my cancellation policy at the Inn.
LUKE: Because of snow?
LORELAI: Yes. From now on if anyone cancels for any reason that I don't agree with within two years of the date in question, no, no! Make it three! Then, I am not going to refund their money and I'm going to kick them in the groin!
LUKE: Geez.
LORELAI: But with my left foot. Because my right foot is still throbbing from being frozen in icy cold water which has effectively ended my foot modeling career!
LUKE: Foot modeling is a dying art anyway.
LORELAI: I am with you now, buddy, a hundred percent.
LUKE: With me on what?
LORELAI: Snow is nothing but annoying icy frozen water stuff that falls out of the sky at inconvenient times. It's Mother Nature's icy "Screw you, Lorelai Gilmore". It's just stupid stuff you have to shovel out of the way so customers can get into the Inn. It's the stuff that melts and leaks through your roof! It's the stuff that stalls your car, it's the stuff that buries your car –
[Snow starts to fall from the sky again.]
LORELAI: Oh no! No! Don't even try to make up with me now! You and me are through! [She swats at the snow] You stupid – hate – you!
ELDER GILMORE'S POOL HOUSE
[Rory and Lorelai knock on the door. The valet answers.]
LORELAI: Hello, Robert.
ROBERT: Good evening, ladies.
RICHARD: Hello, girls.
RORY: Hey, grandpa.
LORELAI: Hi, Dad.
RICHARD: Did you come together tonight?
LORELAI: Oh, no, just a lucky coincidence.
[Emily is sitting by the fireplace.]
LORELAI: Well, hello, Mom.
EMILY: Hello, girls.
RORY: Hi, Grandma.
EMILY: Just go about your drinks. I'm just here to sit with the dog.
LORELAI: Dog?
RORY: Oh, he's cute!
LORELAI: When did you get a dog?
EMILY: She's not our dog.
LORELAI: No less confused.
RICHARD: And, it's a he.
EMILY: The dog?
RICHARD: The dog is a boy.
EMILY: I thought you said it was a girl.
RICHARD: I got another peek. It was rolling around on its back and it was painfully obvious.
EMILY: They're so hairy down there.
RICHARD: This one especially.
LORELAI: It's going from weird to weirder.
RICHARD: The usual beverage for everybody?
RORY: So he's not your dog?
EMILY: It just showed up in our yard yesterday morning. We have no idea how it got here or where it came from. It has no tags.
RICHARD: He's a very big mystery, this dog.
EMILY: Oh, now I'm monopolizing things and I'm not even here. Please, go about your drinks.
RICHARD: No, no, I'm having Robert make one up for you as well.
EMILY: Are you sure? Because I'm not officially here.
RICHARD: Absolutely.
[Robert brings in the drinks.]
EMILY: Thank you, Richard.
RORY: So how long are you going to keep him?
RICHARD: As long as it takes to find the owners.
EMILY: Richard had to miss a half day of work yesterday.
RICHARD: But Emily has agreed to write a note excusing my absence, so it should be okay.
EMILY [smiling]: Okay, now pretend I'm not here. You girls and I can chat later.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, um, Rory, oh my God, did I tell you about the horrendous thing that Mom did? She can be such a witch with a ‘B'.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Oh, geez, Mom, I forgot you were there. My pretending is that good.
RORY: We can't really pretend you're not here, Grandma.
RICHARD: That's true, Emily. You have a presence that cannot be ignored.
EMILY: Well, fine. I can leave.
RICHARD: No, no! The dog likes you there. Join in the conversation if you wish.
EMILY: Well, I am curious to know when you girls got the bad news today.
LORELAI: What bad news?
EMILY: Christopher's news.
RORY: What about him?
EMILY: You haven't heard?
RORY: Nothing.
EMILY: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Same here.
RICHARD: Well, that's odd.
EMILY: I would have thought he would have called them right away.
RICHARD: One of them, at least.
LORELAI: Guys, what news? You're making me nervous here.
EMILY: Straub died.
[Rory and Lorelai look horrified.]
LORELAI: Christopher's father died?
EMILY: This morning.
LORELAI: Oh my God, how?
EMILY: Well, he'd been sick.
RICHARD: Very badly. He'd been diagnosed just a month ago, but it already spread.
EMILY: He was the picture of health, so it caught poor Francine completely off guard. That poor woman.
LORELAI: I can't believe Chris didn't tell us.
RICHARD: He may not have been in any shape to think straight.
LORELAI [to Rory]: Did you check all your voicemails?
RORY: Yeah. Yeah, I did.
EMILY: It's terrible having more than one answering service. That's the way you miss things.
LORELAI: Well, I mean, we should send something, right? For the funeral? Does he want us to go?
EMILY: He was very quiet on the phone, he was only good for the headlines.
RICHARD: Well, you can't blame him.
EMILY: He had a very tortured relationship with that man, but none of that matters at the end.
LORELAI: We should send him a card, or flowers.
RORY: We should send flowers.
LORELAI: Everything sounds so lame.
EMILY: Well, whatever it is, send it to Francine. Christopher and the baby are staying with her until all of this is behind them. I'll give you the address before you go.
RICHARD: We'll send something together, Emily?
EMILY: I've already signed your name to some flowers.
[The dog stands up.]
EMILY [surprised]: Oh! He moved! Is it supposed to do that?
RICHARD: Oh, Emily. Let me show you how he likes his blanket arranged. He's a bit picky.
EMILY: I appreciate your help.
LORELAI [to Rory]: Poor Chris. I mean, it's so sudden.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Did you even know his dad was sick?
RORY: Well. Kind of.
LORELAI: You knew?
RORY: Dad told me.
LORELAI: When did he tell you?
RORY: He didn't make it sound like it was a big thing. Like he was that sick.
LORELAI: And with Sherry gone, and the baby – yikes.
RORY: Yeah. Yikes.
[Richard is rolling up a corner of the blanket near the dog's head.]
RICHARD: - this, the bump acts as a kind of pillow.
EMILY: Very clever!
RICHARD: There's a dog hair in your drink. I'll have Robert make you another one.
EMILY: Oh, that's okay.
RICHARD [taking the glass]: No, no, I insist. [He gets up] Robert, we need dog hair removal.
HAYDEN'S HOUSE – OUTSIDE.
[Rory pulls up in her car. She walks up to the door carrying a brown paper bag. She rings the bell; Chris answers.]
RORY: Hi.
CHRIS: Hi.
RORY: I heard about your dad.
CHRIS: Yeah, I figured you would, at your Friday night dinner. God, is tonight Friday?
RORY: I didn't realize how serious it was. I wasn't listening.
CHRIS: Rory, I kind of veiled it.
RORY: I'm sorry. [She looks around uncomfortably, then remembers the bag she is carrying.] I brought cookies. [She holds them out to him.]
CHRIS [looks in the bag and smiles]: And milk. Milk and cookies.
RORY: Is that okay?
[Chris gestures for her to come inside.]
LATER
[Rory leaves the house and gets into her car. She dials a number on her cell phone.]
LORELAI: Hello?
RORY: It's me.
LORELAI: Hey! Where are you?
RORY: I'm just leaving Dad's.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I came to see Dad because he came to school yesterday, wanted to make amends and have breakfast, but I blew him off, even after he told me that his dad was sick.
LORELAI: Aw, hon –
RORY: And, I don't know, maybe he did say how sick he was, between the lines at least, but I just held him off. And he didn't say that he was dying. I just felt so awful the whole time at dinner tonight.
LORELAI: It's okay.
RORY: No, it's not, because, regardless of Dad's faults, he's human and he needs us, but he's so isolated from us that he can't just call or reach out to me, or to you, especially. But he really needed to call you, and you guys go so far back, you knew his dad.
LORELAI: I know, but –
RORY: And now he's in the middle of dealing with all this sad and practical stuff of his dad's death and he could really use more visitors – especially you. So go. Please. I want you to.
LORELAI: Well, I'm glad to hear you say this, babe, because I'm sort of pulling up behind you here.
[Rory looks to see the Jeep pull up behind her car.]
RORY: Go. I'm taking off, so give him another hug for me.
LORELAI: I will.
RORY: And I told him to call if he needs a babysitter. Remind him of that.
LORELAI: I will. Drive safe.
[Rory drives away. Lorelai gets out of her car and walks up to the house, also carrying a paper bag. She rings the bell. Chris opens the door.]
CHRIS: You just missed Rory.
LORELAI: Eh, we're relaying it tonight.
CHRIS: You guys are something else.
LORELAI: We try.
CHRIS: Milk and cookies?
LORELAI [pulls out a bottle of tequila]: Grown-up milk and cookies.
CHRIS: Come on in, friend.
[He steps aside and Lorelai enters the house.]
LUKE'S DINER – NEXT MORNING
[A man wearing a Revolutionary w*r costume enters. Lorelai and Rory are sitting at their table.]
LORELAI: Must you do that?
RORY: Do what?
LORELAI: Sip.
RORY: Sip? You object to sipping?
LORELAI: If it's done at a decibel level rivaling Louis Armstrong blowing a high ‘C' then yes! I object!
RORY: I'll put my mute on.
LORELAI: Thanks, Satchmo.
RORY: Mm! We're just minutes away from the big re-enactment!
LORELAI: Oh, my God, do not talk in that high-pitched girly voice of yours!
RORY: Oh, now, come on.
LORELAI: You come on.
RORY: I'm a girl, my voice is my voice.
LORELAI: Well, I should have had a boy in anticipation of times like this.
RORY: So it's your fault.
LORELAI: Or Christopher's. Whoever supplies that girl or boy part of the chromosomes.
RORY: It's the guy.
LORELAI: I'm sorry I'm not vivacious.
RORY: It was for a good cause.
LORELAI: I never remember to drink water. That is the key.
RORY: Lots of water!
LORELAI: Pancakes!
RORY: What about ‘em?
LORELAI: Surefire thing to make my head feel less awkward for being attached to my neck.
RORY: Then you are getting pancakes.
LORELAI: Have you ever been this hung over? I mean, I don't want to know because I don't want to hear about it, but if you have, I am sorry. And if you haven't, maybe your life has been a little too sheltered. Good night. [She puts her head down on the table.]
[Kirk bursts into the diner half-dressed in a Revolutionary w*r costume.]
KIRK: Has anyone seen Taylor?
[Lorelai covers her ears.]
KIRK: I need to talk to Taylor. Come on, people, time is of the essence.
LORELAI: Throw something sharp at him.
RORY: Haven't seen him, Kirk.
KIRK: Oh, no. Oh, no.
RORY: What's wrong?
KIRK: Ah, nothing. Everything's fine.
LORELAI: Lulu's dress okay, Kirk? And answer quietly.
KIRK: It's perfect. Fits like a glove. Well, see ya.
[He runs away.]
RORY: I think his mother's over-stretching his laundry again.
LORELAI: Where is Luke? I need to order before I puke!
RORY: Was Dad drinking like this last night?
LORELAI: Oh, he was the pusher. He just did not want to stop talking. Talking led to more drinking. Drinking led to more talking. But it was good.
RORY [looking worried]: Yeah.
LORELAI: I wasn't going to stay that long. I don't know if he even has many friends any more. All of his old buddies are scattered all around, you know? And his support group is two and heavily into Sesame Street.
RORY: What time did you finally get home?
LORELAI: Sun high, birds sing, head hurts.
RORY: It was good that you went.
LORELAI: Yeah, I know, he needed to vent, you know? And we alternated between feeling bad about his dad and not liking him so much for pretty much being a jerk his whole life.
RORY: Well, the one time I met Straub, he did seem a little bitter.
LORELAI: The night took a very weird turn when he started coming up with all of his dad's negative traits corresponding to the letters of the alphabet.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: ‘A' he was absent, ‘B' he was a bully, ‘C' he was cold, ‘D' he was dreary –
RORY: What was ‘K'?
LORELAI: He was "Kuwait-y".
RORY: Kuwait-y, like the country?
LORELAI: Yes, as it got later it got sillier.
RORY: Sounds like you're just what he needed. You might be his oldest buddy.
LORELAI: True. But he talked on and on about you and how good it was that you visited.
RORY: I'm glad. We had some stuff to figure out, and we've pretty much figured it out.
LORELAI: Good.
[Luke walks in.]
LORELAI: Hi!
LUKE: Oh, I didn't know you guys were here.
RORY: Hi, Luke.
[Luke and Lorelai kiss.]
LORELAI: Hello, there.
LUKE: I had to run to the store. [Points out the window.] Look at this, this re-enactment lunacy.
LORELAI: Oh, we are so front row for that.
LUKE: Your eyes are red.
LORELAI: I had a bad night's sleep last night.
LUKE: Oh, yeah? What happened?
LORELAI: Well –
RORY: Oh, I kept her up pretty late, you know, girl talk.
LUKE: Oh, okay. So what do you guys want to eat?
RORY: Well, she will have –
LORELAI: More coffee, that's all I want.
LUKE: Okay, how about you Rory?
RORY: Yeah, I guess I'm fine with just coffee, too.
LUKE: Oh, you two are easy.
LORELAI: Spread that around, will you?
LUKE: Will do. [He leaves to get the coffee.]
RORY: What about your pancakes?
LORELAI: Pancakes are hangover food, it would get him suspicious.
RORY: Well, I could have ordered them for you.
LORELAI: Well, I wasn't stopping you.
RORY: I just wasn't fast enough.
LORELAI: I shouldn't have lied about where I was last night. I'm over nineteen and lying to my boyfriend about stuff. That's wrong.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: I could just say his father died and I went over to comfort him. With tequila. Which we drank, all night long, alone.
RORY: He didn't need to know. It's better that he doesn't know.
LORELAI: He didn't need to know.
RORY [shrieks]: Ooh, the re-enactment! It's starting!
LORELAI [cringes]: Voice.
RORY [lower]: The re-enactment. It's starting.
LORELAI: Much better, let's go.
OUTSIDE - BY THE GAZEBO
[A small crowd has gathered to watch.]
REVEREND: Welcome to Stars Hollow's new, historically accurate Revolutionary w*r re-enactment. And to the members of the press I'd like to point out that my best side is my right side. [silence] Left side's fine, too. I was just kidding. People forget that men of the cloth can crack jokes, too. [silence] Anyway, I'd like to introduce three special participants, [he gestures to the children standing next to him] Bobby, Tara and Craig, who were chosen from our own Stars Hollow elementary school to narrate what you see today.
BOBBY: The year –
CHILDREN: Seventeen Seventy-Nine.
BOBBY: The location –
CHILDREN: Stars Hollow.
LORELAI: Children should sh**t us for what we make them do.
RORY: Sh.
BOBBY: - fortune turning point when our brave town militia learned that a powerful British general was riding through the area to rejoin his troops and wage a decisive battle. It inspired an idea.
TARA: First, the militia went off to block the high road.
MAN #2: Come on, men! Let's block the high road!
[The men turn and run away.]
RORY: What about horses? Wouldn't they have had horses?
LORELAI: Or at least some coconuts to bang together for a nice sound effect.
CHILDREN: Brave our soldiers are.
TARA: The British general had no choice but to take the only path or road on this snowy day. The road through Stars Hollow.
CRAIG: Soon a scout arrived to warn of the general's coming.
[A man rides by on a horse.]
MAN [Calling out]: The British general is coming! The British general is coming!
LORELAI: So expositional.
RORY: I guess Tony Kushner wasn't available.
CHILDREN: And then the general arrived.
TAYLOR [riding in on a horse]: It's certainly unfortunate that the high road was blocked this day, forcing me to ride through town.
LORELAI: Seriously. This dialogue is worse than From Justin To Kelly.
CRAIG: Then a brave woman put herself in harm's way and emerged to distract the general.
[The "brave woman" walks slowly out of the courthouse.]
RORY: Is that your dress?
LORELAI: Yeah. I made it to Lulu's specifications. Did she get bonier all of a sudden?
RORY: And taller?
TAYLOR: Good day, fair lady. You intrigue me. What have you to say?
[The woman shakes her hair out of her face. It is Kirk.]
TAYLOR: Kirk!
RORY: Kirk?
LORELAI: No wonder her breasts weren't holding it up.
TAYLOR: What are you doing? Where's Lulu?
KIRK: She's sick. I tried to find you but you weren't around and I didn't know what to do.
TAYLOR: Everyone's looking!
KIRK: I didn't want to let the town down, with the press here and all, so I just did it myself.
TARA: That's the ugliest lady I've ever seen.
TAYLOR: This is far and away the worst thing you have ever done. I am livid with you!
KIRK: We're not supposed to be arguing, Taylor. We're supposed to be making love.
TAYLOR: Dear God. [He gets down off the horse and plays along.]
CRAIG: This simple, common woman whose livelihood defied laws of morality but acting in a fashion which God would forgive her, led the British general to the warmth of her boudoir. She saved Stars Hollow.
[The Reverend snickers.]
BOBBY: Reverend.
REVEREND: Sorry.
CRAIG: The British general was kept occupied long enough for Lafayette's troops to ambush his men – a decisive victory for the colonists.
[The men who went to block the high road return.]
CHILDREN: Thanks to the Stars Hollow militia and the woman whose livelihood
–
[The children trail off, out of synch.]
RORY: Now what? Is it over?
LORELAI: No idea. [they look around] How far are Kirk and Taylor going to take this thing?
RORY [Staring at the door]: I'm not leaving ‘till I find out.
LORELAI: I have to get back to the Inn. Keep me posted.
RORY: I'm riveted.
[Lorelai leaves.]
ELDER GILMORE POOL HOUSE
[Richard is getting ready for work. Emily lets herself in.]
RICHARD: Hello.
EMILY: Hello, Richard. How are you?
RICHARD: Very good. And you?
EMILY: Excellent. I was going to check on the dog. I was thinking of putting up some fliers around the neighborhood. Fliers are tacky, but they work. And I thought you could look up on your computer where the best place to print them is.
RICHARD: The dog is gone.
EMILY: Gone? He's gone?
RICHARD: She's gone.
EMILY: I thought you said it was a boy.
RICHARD: Well, apparently I misread what I saw.
EMILY: She was very hairy down there.
RICHARD: Your calls paid off. Some one you called called someone else, and somehow found the owner and she came and picked the dog up, late last night.
EMILY: I didn't even hear anyone come by.
RICHARD: Well, I would have called to let you know but I didn't see a light on and I didn't want to disturb you.
EMILY: It wouldn't have disturbed me.
RICHARD: Well, now I'll know for next time. Not that we'll ever find a dog in the yard again.
EMILY: Yes. Well. I hope you told them to get an I.D. tag for it. It's irresponsible not to have one.
RICHARD: I told them how much they put us out. I missed a half day's work, and you were inconvenienced even more.
EMILY: Yes. Yes, I was.
RICHARD: Her name was Princess, by the way.
EMILY: Was it? Princess? [They look at each other for a moment.] Well, I should get back to the house. I've got a million things to do.
RICHARD: I have to go to work.
[He closes the door behind her.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY
[Lorelai is pulling into the driveway in the Jeep and talking on her cell phone.]
LORELAI: Believe me, I know the futility of fighting Mother Nature. She's been a real "mother" lately. Almost rivals my mother. [She laughs to herself.] Yeah, but you and your plow do control Mother Nature's droppings, a.k.a. the snow, and all I'm saying is could you try to keep it from blocking the Dragonfly's one and only driveway? You know, it kind of blocks
us in and we get all cranky and claustrophobic, especially when we're out of coffee. Which I'm not anticipating, but I didn't anticipate it before and it happened, and I suffered withdrawal pains. [Pause] Right. Well, I really appreciate it. I actually like plows, you know? They look like fun. [Pause] Right. I'm sure plowing doesn't pay enough, though. That part's not fun. I used to be a maid. I know low wages. [She gets out of the car.] Well, I'm really not comfortable telling you what I made then or what I make now. Just, anything you can do will help. Okay, thank you.
[She hangs up, staring at her front yard, which has been turned into an ice rink. Luke is walking toward her with skates in his hand.]
LORELAI: What is this?
LUKE: It's an ice rink.
LORELAI: An ice rink? How did this happen?
LUKE: Jack Frost brought it.
LORELAI: Does he look like Luke Danes?
LUKE: A little. Not as handsome.
LORELAI: You made me an ice rink?
LUKE: It's just a rink in a box. You set it up, you fill it with water, it's not a big deal.
LORELAI: It is a big deal. It's a very big deal.
[Luke hands her the skates.]
LUKE: Here. Try it out.
[They sit as she puts on the skates.]
LUKE: My dad did this for me once. I was in a hockey phase. ‘Till I broke my nose the first time. Skated right into a tree.
LORELAI: What in the world inspired you to do this?
LUKE: Well, I felt kind of bad about you and snow, the rough time you were having, and I really wasn't helping any by saying all that stuff about snow being a pain and impractical, and it's just icy water falling from the sky, and I thought maybe I'd get you two back together. Make you feel better about snow again.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah?
LUKE: I'm grumpy about stuff but I don't want you to be.
[He helps her to her feet.]
LUKE: Careful.
LORELAI: I'm being careful. Thanks for reconciling us.
LUKE: Any time. [Pause] You were lying this morning.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: You said you were fine but you didn't look it. You get sick or something last night?
LORELAI: No. No, I just had a headache. Still do. Just one of those things.
LUKE: Yeah, I get headaches. I just feel bad.
LORELAI: That's all it was, a headache. I love this ice rink!
LUKE: Try it out.
[She giggles as she starts to skate across the ice.]
LORELAI: Oh, it's great!
LUKE: Keep away from trees.
LORELAI: Ah, I look like a dork but I love it.
LUKE: You look fine.
LORELAI: You want to be Randy to my Tai?
LUKE: Nah, I'll just watch.
[She skates around happily.]

LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Lorelai comes out of the bathroom. Luke is lying in bed.]
LORELAI: Hey. You built me a shelf. That's so nice.
LUKE: It was anything but nice. I kept using your crazy toothpaste.
LORELAI: There's nothing crazy about my toothpaste.
LUKE: It's cinnamon.
LORELAI: So what?
LUKE: I don't like cinnamon. I like normal flavored.
LORELAI: What exactly is this normal flavor?
LUKE: You know, striped.
LORELAI: Striped. That's not a flavor.
LUKE: It is in the toothpaste world.
LORELAI: Ooo, the toothpaste world. Is that anything like Whoville?
[She joins him in bed.]
LUKE: I'm exhausted.
LORELAI [perky]: I'm exhilarated.
LUKE: You know, you don't have to do this.
LORELAI: Hey. Going to bed early every once in a while is good for ya.
LUKE: I have to get up at four. You don't.
LORELAI: Yes, I know, but every night you have early deliveries is a night we spend apart and seriously, where's the good in that?
LUKE: Okay. [He turns off the light.] ‘Night.
[They kiss.]
LORELAI: Night.
[They kiss again. Luke rolls over. Lorelai is sitting up. She looks around, wide awake.]
LORELAI: Man, is it quiet. Do you hear how quiet it is?
LUKE: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: Do you have a pin, 'cause I want to hear it drop.
LUKE: No pins.
LORELAI: Okay. Sorry. So, okay. Good night. [She leans back, then taps Luke on the shoulder.] Hey, Luke. Why don't you have a T.V.?
LUKE: I have a T.V.
LORELAI: No, I mean, in here, in the bedroom so you can watch T.V. in bed.
LUKE [rolls back over]: I don't watch T.V. in bed. Studies show that it's not good for your sleep.
LORELAI: What studies?
LUKE: Watching T.V. in bed screws up your REM sleep.
LORELAI: But Charlie Rose, Jon Stewart, Pink Lady and Jeff?
LUKE: All screw up your REM sleep.
LORELAI: How does Charlie Rose screw up your REM sleep?
LUKE: Because he's always got some guy on pushing a book about how everything's all going to hell, or they're going to pass a law, how everyone with a nose ring is going to get shipped off to China. Suddenly you're depressed, thinking we're all going to die and don't drink the water, there's anthrax in my bagel - and bam, there goes your REM sleep.
LORELAI: Or Mel Brooks is on, and he is so funny, and you think, "What a wonderful world we live in, that there's a Mel Brooks to go to sleep to."
LUKE: Mel Brooks is never on Charlie Rose, and when he is on he's talking about n*zi, and then you go to sleep and you dream about n*zi and they all look like Nathan Lane, and you're creeped out for days.
LORELAI: You know what ruins your REM sleep, is those articles about REM sleep. And you know what could help you forget those articles about REM sleep?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: A television.
[Luke opens his eyes.]
LORELAI: Say goodnight, Gracie.
LUKE: Goodnight, Gracie.
[He rolls back over. Lorelai tries to sleep, then pops her eyes open.]
OPENING CREDITS
YALE NEWSROOM
[Rory walks in and heads for her desk. Doyle is in her chair and Paris is sitting on the desk, fanning him.]
RORY: Move butt, please.
PARIS: In a minute.
RORY: What's wrong with Doyle?
PARIS: Mitchum Huntzberger just left.
RORY: Logan's dad?
DOYLE: My entire body is numb.
RORY: What was he doing here?
DOYLE: What was he doing here? Busting my chops, which are now numb. Oh my God, my chops are completely numb!
PARIS: Don't speak, don't speak.
RORY: So Mitchum Huntzberger stopped by just to make various parts of Doyle's body insensate?
PARIS: He's a deep-pocket alumnus. Every few months Yale reels guys like him in for banquets and luncheons.
DOYLE: And he's going to New York to throw some party for Seymour Hersh on Friday night. [To Paris] A little faster? [She obliges.]
RORY: Seymour Hersh? The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh? Wow.
DOYLE: The man owns thirteen newspapers. He's my best contact in the business and I fell like a house of cards. I made that joke about Abu Grab. God, that was inappropriate.
PARIS: It wasn't supposed to be a ha ha, funny Abu Grab joke. Stop b*at yourself up.
DOYLE: Then he busted me on the fact that Logan hasn't had a by-line all year, wants me to light a fire under him and get him to write. [In a deeper, serious voice:] "I'd like to hand the business over to my son, Doyle, so it'd be nice if he knew something about it."
PARIS: He's going to pass his empire on to that playboy cad while a rising star such as Doyle is standing right before him.
DOYLE: In a pool of my own sweat. See, it's kind of a minus.
RORY: I'm sure it wasn't that bad.
DOYLE [Stands]: Now I'm Logan's journalistic Godfather, and I can't even get the punk to show up, never mind write a story.
RORY: Do you even know if he can write?
DOYLE: Oh, he can write. He's actually an excellent writer. How's that for God giving with both hands, huh? Every now and then, usually when he gets the flu or the clap, and can't party, he'll throw us a bone and write something. It's always good. Damn good. Stupid bastard.
PARIS: Well, you are his editor, Doyle. Talk to him. Assign him something.
DOYLE: I did. He's supposed to cover the student uproar over Assistant Professor Warrick resigning.
RORY: And?
DOYLE: And he said thank you, left the room, and I heard him laughing all the way down the hall. I haven't seen him here since. [He sits.] I don't know what to do. [Paris starts fanning him again.]
RORY: Um, Doyle, I just finished that piece on the dissatisfaction of the faculty with the tenure system, and I bet a lot of my notes would overlap with Logan's story.
DOYLE: Point, Gilmore, point?
RORY: If you want, I could arrange to get together with Logan. Share my notes with him. Maybe it could get him started.
DOYLE: Really? You'd do that?
RORY: Sure. I mean, if it would help you out.
DOYLE: Gilmore, I am loving you at this moment.
PARIS: Moment's over.
DOYLE: Moment's over. Thanks.
RORY: Sure, boss. Anything for the team.
[Paris is glaring at Doyle. He gestures "What could I do?" Paris tosses some files on his desk and stomps away. Doyle sighs, picks up the files and starts fanning himself.]
DRAGONFLY INN - DINING ROOM
[Lorelai is leading a staff meeting. All the employees are sitting facing her.]
LORELAI: Okay, everyone remember your time cards. Punch in, punch out, including lunch and breaks. Okay, now, next on the agenda is something very exciting. The Dragonfly Inn's first official sexual harassment seminar.
MICHEL: Ah, finally. Yes, good, talk to them.
LORELAI: Sexual harassment is bad. So no one touch anyone in any funny places unless specifically asked. Moving on.
MICHEL: That's it? That's the seminar? Where's the speech about people not ogling other people like an object of desire? How about explaining that the way some people walk with a sway or a bounce, it is natural. It is because
we work out, and we take Pilates, and -
LORELAI: No one touch Michel! Moving on. Uh, Billy, Adam, you've got to remember to securely lock the padlock on the stables, not just hook it on. Cletus has figured out how to push it off with his nose, and two days in a row I found him at reception. [She laughs.] Now if you could just check people in, that would be a different story, but - until then, um, lock the stable and check the lock and - Kirk. [She notices Kirk sitting in the back.] What are you doing here?
KIRK: Staff meeting.
LORELAI: You don't work here.
KIRK: I thought I might like to go into hotel management someday, and I figured this was a good place to learn.
LORELAI: Oh, Kirk, you can't just crash a staff meeting.
KIRK [Writing on a clipboard]: "Outsiders cannot crash staff meetings." I'm learning so much.
LORELAI: Okay, anything else to discuss before we wrap it up here?
MICHEL: Yes. [He stands.] We have a problem with some honor bar discrepancies. For the past few weeks after I have checked a room and found the honor bar intact, the next day, Toblerones are missing.
SOOKIE: What?
MICHEL: Only Toblerones, and only in certain rooms. I think we have thieves.
LORELAI: Or guests.
MICHEL: No, these are not the guests. The disappearances are happening in rooms no one is staying in. I think we have thieves and it's obviously an inside job. These people are waiting until I've made my rounds. They're waiting until I've checked my list, ‘till I initial my list, and only then do they steal the Toblerones.
LORELAI: Maybe you counted wrong.
MICHEL: I say we install surveillance cameras, fingerprint the staff, run the prints through the FBI and have mandatory searches before they leave at the end of their shift.
LORELAI: Oh, well, that sounds great. Everybody drop your pants for Michel before you leave. Meeting adjourned.
[They all get up and head back to work.]
KIRK: No food spread? The staff meetings at Connecticut Light and Power always have a lovely food spread. Nice bagels, an assortment of schmear. [The staff ignore him.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Lane is busy waiting on tables. Kyon walks in.]
LANE: Hey, Kyon. I'm busy, so quick, what do you got?
KYON: Many things. These come house, Mrs. Kim throw directly in trash.
LANE: My Sam Ash catalogues! What's that smell?
KYON: They landed in old fish and bok choy.
LANE: Figures, what else you got?
[Kyon pulls something out of her bag.]
LANE: My old Madonna t-shirt!
KYON: Mrs. Kim use as rag. Says little horse-face good to scrub scum.
LANE: I wore this, ironically, by the way. I was never into her. Not my thing.
KYON [suspiciously]: Right.
LANE: Anything else, Kyon?
KYON: Overheard conversation. Mrs. Kim having Lunar New Year at her house this year. She expect you to come.
LANE: Oh, she does?
KYON: She says not coming is same as spitting on ancestors and ancestors no like spit.
LANE: Expects me to come. Unbelievable. After she attacks my boyfriend on the street, damning him to the fires of hell and swimming with carnivorous dogs. And now she expects me to smile and curtsey and just go to Lunar New Year dinner like nothing happened. Nice, huh?
KYON: Whoa, I'm not your sounding board. I deliver scoop, you give me Monte Cristo sandwich.
LANE: Fine. Sit over there.
[Lane goes to the table in the other corner, where Zach and Brian are looking at photos.]
ZACH: There are some good ones here.
BRIAN: Definitely.
LANE: Oh, our band pictures! How are they?
BRIAN: They're all good.
ZACH: Except the one of you bending over and looking through your legs.
BRIAN: I was just seeing what works.
ZACH: I like this one.
BRIAN: A tree's covering my face.
ZACH: Come on, dude, the good of the many.
BRIAN: What do you like, Lane?
LANE: I don't like any of them.
ZACH: What?
LANE: You guys look good, I mean, not the Brian with his face between his legs one, or the profile one where you've got your finger in your mouth and the peek-a-boo look –
ZACH: Right, peek-a-boo! That's what it is.
BRIAN: I was experimenting.
LANE: But I don't look good.
ZACH: What are you talking about? [He grabs the photo.] You look totally cool, like a real chick.
LANE: I look like the Korean Buddy Holly.
BRIAN: Buddy Holly was cool.
LANE: May he rest in peace, but Buddy Holly was not an attractive man.
BRIAN: I find him attractive.
ZACH: Dude, don't say every thought out loud.
LANE: Can we re-take them?
ZACH: Like thirty-seven dollars just grows on trees?
BRIAN: You're being too hard on yourself.
ZACH: Totally. Lame. We're not Maroon 5 or the Gee Whiz Slicky Boys. We don't want to look all fake.
LANE: No, but halfway decent would be nice.
ZACH: Lighten up. They work.
CUSTOMER: Miss, some more coffee, please?
LANE: At least she didn't say mister.
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE - DINING ROOM
[Richard and Emily are sitting opposite from each other, going through paperwork.]
EMILY: The lease on my Mercedes is up next month.
RICHARD: Do you want to buy it?
EMILY: I finally have the seat setting where I like it.
RICHARD [chuckling]: I'll make the arrangements tomorrow.
EMILY: Thank you, Richard.
RICHARD: Now, uh, we need to schedule work on the water heater. Um, I was wondering if Friday morning would work for you?
EMILY: Let me look.
RICHARD: They estimate the work to be about an hour, which means they'll be done in June.
EMILY: Oh, no, I have a hair appointment Friday morning.
RICHARD: For what?
EMILY [smiling]: What do you mean for what?
RICHARD: Your hair looks perfect to me.
EMILY: Oh, now.
RICHARD: Well, I can arrange for Robert to let the workman in and supervise it if that works for you.
EMILY: Well, that would be fine. Thank you, Richard.
RICHARD: You're welcome, Emily. What's next on the agenda?
EMILY: The Modern Museum gala is coming up.
RICHARD: Oh, yes. Martin Forman is being honored this year.
EMILY: And Sugar Farthington is organizing it.
RICHARD: Well, if Sugar's organizing it, then of course you should go.
EMILY: Well, if Martin's being honored, then you should go.
RICHARD: Sugar is one of your closest friends.
EMILY: Martin is one of your most trusted colleagues.
RICHARD: Well, then, perhaps we should both attend.
EMILY: That does seem to be the sensible thing to do.
RICHARD: All right. Then we'll both attend.
EMILY [smiling]: Fine.
RICHARD: Uh, so, have we discussed the water heater?
EMILY: Yes, we have.
RICHARD: Ah. More water?
[Emily nods. Richard gets up to re-fill her glass.]
YALE CAMPUS PUB
[Rory is drinking coffee, waiting for Logan to arrive. Her table is piled with file folders. Logan pushes his way through a crowd.]
LOGAN: Hey, Ace.
RORY: Hi, Logan. I didn't see you there. Hey. Um, how are you?
LOGAN: I'm good.
RORY: Oh, good. Good. Okay, so good. Um, here they are.
LOGAN: These are the notes for one story?
RORY: Yeah, I'm kind of a note freak.
LOGAN [sitting]: Man, Ace, I'm impressed and partially terrified.
RORY: Okay. Well, I've divided them up into sections, so [pointing] interviews, research, statistics. I wasn't sure what you already had, but I figured there's something here that can help you with your story.
LOGAN: I hope you're getting extra credit for this.
RORY: Oh, it's nothing.
LOGAN: Seems like a lot of work on your part, going through this stuff, organizing it for me.
RORY: Well, I'm kind of an organization freak, too.
LOGAN: Plus, I'm sure it wasn't your idea to give up your evening like this, to come here and meet me. Was it?
RORY: Um, I'm just doing a little public service. That's all.
LOGAN: Public service?
RORY: Yes. Doyle looked like he was about to liquefy after your dad talked to him, so I chose to stop that from happening, for the sake of the janitorial staff.
LOGAN: Yeah. He has a thing for by-lines, my father.
RORY: Apparently he has plans for you.
LOGAN: Yes. Isn't that thrilling. Sorry Doyle took the hit. My dad can be a real bully when he wants to be.
RORY: He's a very interesting man.
LOGAN: You met him?
RORY: No, I've just… read about him. I mean, he's a big guy.
LOGAN: Maybe you'll get to meet him someday.
RORY [nods]: Oh, did I show you how I divided these up? Interviews, research, um –
LOGAN: So how come I never see you around?
RORY: I'm around.
LOGAN: Yeah? Where?
RORY: Class, coffee cart, the student's store when I run out of thumbtacks…
LOGAN: Wow, thrilling life.
RORY: I'm really not that boring.
LOGAN: Oh, I know you're not boring.
RORY: Oh, Doyle told me that your dad is throwing a party for Seymour Hersh?
LOGAN: Ah, you want to talk about boring?
RORY: How can meeting Seymour Hersh be boring? I love him. I read My Lai Four when I was twelve and I've been obsessed with him ever since.
LOGAN: You read a book about the My Lai m*ssacre when you were twelve?
RORY: Well, I polished off Nancy Drew that year too.
LOGAN: Well, I guarantee, these parties always turn into a bunch of drunks discussing stocks, cars and the latest friends to be indicted. It's boring. I just go, take a date so I have somebody to talk to, and bail as soon as my dad's back is turned.
RORY: Oh, so you're going?
LOGAN: Daddy says.
RORY: Wow, lucky.
LOGAN: No.
RORY: To spend the evening with a great writer, and to get to meet him, hear him talk? Very, very lucky.
LOGAN: You think so?
RORY: Definitely.
LOGAN: Well, maybe this time it won't be so bad after all. [A pause; Rory looks uncomfortable.] So, do you want to get something to drink or do you have to go?
RORY: No, I don't have to go. I don't have anywhere to go.
LOGAN: Okay. Be right back.
[He gets up to go to the bar. Rory looks after him, excited.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai enters.]
LORELAI: Hey, Lane.
LANE: Hi, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hmm. You look different.
LANE: I do?
LORELAI: Yeah, you look cute. I mean, you always look cute, but this is just a new facet of your cuteness.
LANE: Thanks. You look cute too.
LORELAI: I have a boyfriend, so maybe this flirting thing we've got going on should just end here.
LANE: Coffee to go?
LORELAI: It's that special time of day.
[We hear Luke getting frustrated in the back.]
LORELAI: What was that?
LANE: It's been like that for an hour. It's the damn oven.
LORELAI: The damn oven?
LUKE [OS]: Damn oven!
LORELAI: What's up with the damn oven?
LUKE: I bought this damn oven and the thermostat doesn't work!
LORELAI: The damn thermostat or just the thermostat?
LUKE: Are you being cute?
LORELAI: Sorry, go on!
LUKE: So I went and I got a new thermostat, and now I can't figure out how to replace the damn thing.
LORELAI: So it is a damn thermostat.
LUKE: I don't have time for this.
LORELAI: Come on! You can do this. [Luke roars at it.] Step at a time here. You pulled the knob off each gas tap on the range, right?
LUKE [OS]: Uh, yeah. So?
LORELAI: Then you remove the four screws securing the face panel, then you remove the panel.
LUKE [OS]: Yeah, I did that.
LORELAI: Hmm. Then you disconnect the oven and gas supply pipe from the outlet of the thermostat?
LUKE [OS]: This is where I got stuck.
LORELAI [nodding]: Did you release the oven sensor retaining clips from the oven lining?
LUKE [OS]: No. No, I didn't. [Pause] Okay! Got it!
LORELAI: Now just pull the sensor out, you should be rolling now.
LUKE [coming out from the kitchen, amazed]: So how, how?
LORELAI: How what?
LUKE: How do you know this?
LORELAI: Well, I couldn't get to sleep the other night, you know, when we went to bed, and so I read your oven manual.
LUKE: You're kidding.
LORELAI: Well, it was either that or the broiler manual, and the oven won, ‘cause it's shiny and pretty.
LUKE: You never cease to amaze me.
LORELAI: And I never will. Bye, Doll. [They kiss] And hey, leave the broiler manual out for me. I'm kind of into this whole kitchen appliance genre now, you know? "Kitch lit".
LUKE: All right.
[She exits as Zach is on his way in.]
LORELAI: Hey there, Zach.
ZACH: Howdy.
LANE: Hi there.
ZACH: Well, aren't we bouncy?
[They kiss]
LANE: I'm in a pretty good mood.
ZACH: Why's that?
LANE: I'm just feeling nice and light.
ZACH [looks closely at her]: What's up with your face?
LANE: Oh, what do you think is up with my face?
ZACH: It looks all nude.
LANE: For a good reason.
ZACH: You're not wearing your glasses.
LANE: That's right.
ZACH: But you're blind without your glasses.
LANE: The wonder of contacts.
ZACH: Contacts?
LANE: Contacts.
ZACH: Why?
LANE: Why? So I don't have to wear glasses.
ZACH: So, like, for all the time?
LANE: Yeah – you okay?
ZACH: I guess. I mean, that's a pretty big thing to just spring on a guy.
LANE: Why?
ZACH: You don't look like you.
LANE: Yes, I do. It's just me, my face, without being impeded by a foreign plastic object.
ZACH: But you're the first smart girl I've ever gone out with, and the glasses are a big part of that.
LANE: Well, my I.Q. is still the same. Contacts don't change that.
ZACH: But you lose that initial impact. Now people will have to talk to you for a few minutes to figure out that you're smart.
LANE: Well, then, that's what they'll have to do.
ZACH: Okay. I'll try to get used to it.
LANE: Yeah. And you will.
CUSTOMER: I'm sorry, am I supposed to eat my soup without a spoon?
ZACH: Of course she doesn't think that, okay? She's really smart, she's just not wearing her glasses! [He hands him a spoon.]
RICHARD'S OFFICE
[Richard is in a business meeting.]
MAN #1: You should have heard him, Richard.
RICHARD: Oh, I can imagine.
MAN #1: They had him on speakerphone, and when Lori heard him screaming she ran in holding her shoe. She thought I was being attacked.
RICHARD [chuckling]: Well, you're in good hands with that Lori.
MAN #2: I wish I had a secretary who'd defend me with her shoe.
RICHARD: Well, he may be mad now, but wait until we go to court.
MAN #1: Well, maybe he'll settle.
MAN #2: Oh, he'll never settle.
RICHARD: Ah, he will, if we send Lori in with her shoe.
MAN #2: Mmm.
MAN #1: He's certainly got his lawyers working on this.
RICHARD: Well, we're going to have to bring in outside counsel. It's going to get a little messy. Who's available?
MAN #2: How about Maurice Newson?
RICHARD: No. He over-colognes.
MAN #1: Briar?
MAN #2: No. Briar's on the Delfini case.
MAN #1: Oh, yeah.
RICHARD: What about Simon McLane?
MAN #2: I don't think you really want Simon on this one, Richard.
RICHARD: Why not? He's always done a top-notch job for us before. He's aggressive, he's not sloppy. He's very creative.
MAN #1: Yes, but Richard –
RICHARD: What?
MAN #2: Well, we just assumed you wouldn't want to work that closely with Simon anymore, you know, since the whole thing with him and Emily?
RICHARD [realization]: Ah. Yes. [He looks pained.] Well, what about Brandt?
MAN #2: Brandt!
MAN #1: Brandt. Mm-hm. Very good.
MAN #2: Terrific.
MAN #1: Brandt it is.
DRAGONFLY INN – KITCHEN
[Lorelai enters.]
LORELAI: Well, apparently the whole padlock discussion was a big dud. I just got a call from Mrs. Berg. Cletus is standing in her wading pool. I need carrots.
SOOKIE: Bottom shelf.
LORELAI: Oh, I love it when I talk and no one listens. Makes me think of home.
[Michel hurries in.]
MICHEL: Okay. I just took the Andersons to room three, I opened the door and when I went inside I found that the bedspread was mussed!
LORELAI: The bedspread was mussed!
SOOKIE [gasps]: Call a cop!
MICHEL: I checked that room personally after it had been cleaned. It was perfect! No muss!
LORELAI: No fuss!
MICHEL: Why are you joking? Why? Do you not care that people are sneaking into our rooms, mussing the beds, eating the food?
LORELAI: Okay. I'm sorry. You're right.
MICHEL: I know I'm right. I do not need you to tell me I'm right.
LORELAI: Okay. So, what do we think is going on here?
MICHEL: I believe that our employees are clandestinely using our rooms for sexual encounters on their coffee breaks.
LORELAI: Come on.
MICHEL: Lars and Celia seem awfully friendly lately. You don't notice them making goo-goo eyes? And Celia has put on weight. Perhaps one too many Toblerones.
LORELAI: I don't think Lars and Celia are having an affair.
SOOKIE: Hey, maybe we got a ghost.
LORELAI: A ghost. That would be cool. People love haunted inns.
SOOKIE: I wonder what kind of ghost we have.
LORELAI: Maybe a Confederate Soldier.
SOOKIE: Or a lonely spinster that never married.
LORELAI: Or Patrick Swayze.
SOOKIE: In search of his lost career.
LORELAI: Maybe we have ghosts having sex and then eating Toblerones.
SOOKIE [giggles]: Ooh, hungry, horny ghosts.
MICHEL: I am done with both of you.
[He leaves.]
LORELAI: I guess I should go up to room three, and see what's – Kirk! What are you doing here?
KIRK: I'm assembling the bouquet garni.
SOOKIE: I thought you hired him.
LORELAI: I did not hire him.
KIRK: I thought I might want to work on a kitchen staff someday, and I figured this was a good place to learn.
LORELAI: Kirk, get out!
KIRK: Can I at least finish my shift?
SOOKIE: No!
[Lorelai's cell phone rings. She walks into the hall to answer it. Scene cuts between Rory's common room and the Inn.]
LORELAI: Hello.
RORY: Hey. What's up?
LORELAI: We have ghosts.
RORY: Well, it's better than rats. Listen, I need a favor.
LORELAI: From me?
RORY: Yes, from you.
LORELAI: Oh, well, let me get out my list. Okay, I'll write this favor down right under the one that says "Gave me life".
RORY: Look. I may have a thing Friday which would mean that I have to get out of Friday night dinner.
LORELAI: A thing?
RORY: I was wondering if you could cover for me?
LORELAI: What kind of a thing? A man thing?
RORY: Possibly a man thing.
LORELAI: Okay, spill. Who is he?
RORY: I don't want to jinx it, okay? It's not a definite. When I know it's a go I promise I'll fill you in. Completely.
LORELAI: I can't believe you're going to leave me alone with my parents just so you can have a social life. What happened to the good old days, with the spinster daughter taking care of the parents and living a lonely, sexless existence?
RORY: So you'll cover for me?
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: Thank you. I'll call you later.
LORELAI: Bye honey. [She hangs up.]
MICHEL: Hey. I just asked Lars if he was seeing anyone special. He misunderstood and he might be filing one of those sexual harassment charges against me. And you, ‘cause I said you made me. [Hey turns and rushes outside.]
LORELAI: Hey, hey. Michel! Come back here!
KIRK: I'll get him.
LANE'S HOUSE
[The band is practicing.]
ZACH: Okay, guys, let's try it again and let's try not to suck.
LANE: We'll get it. We just have to focus.
BRIAN: By the way, your ‘E' string is a little flat.
ZACH: Which, by the way, makes it a little bit more rock and roll. Okay, are we ready?
LANE: I'm down.
ZACH: Eins, zwi, drei, vier…
GIL: Hey, could you not do the countdown in German? It's depressing.
ZACH: Fine. One, two, three, four.
[They start. Lane notices a knocking at the door. They stop]
ZACH: Who the hell is that?
BRIAN: I hope it's not my girlfriend's husband. [giggles]
ZACH: Oh, that's fresh!
[Lane gets up to answer the knocking. She opens the door. Mrs. Kim stands there looking exasperated.]
LANE: Mama.
MRS. KIM: You couldn't even hear me over that noise.
LANE: That noise is my passion, Mama, and you're keeping me from it.
MRS. KIM: ‘E' string was flat, too.
LANE: What can we do for you?
MRS. KIM: This year I am hosting Lunar New Year dinner. You are to come.
LANE: Why?
MRS. KIM: You are my daughter. Not coming is humiliation.
LANE: Have we forgotten the incident at the newsstand?
MRS. KIM: The what?
LANE: You yelled at my boyfriend, in public, Mama! What's that, if it's not humiliation?
MRS. KIM: That is in the past.
LANE: Not for me.
MRS. KIM: You must come to this.
LANE: Oh, yeah? Well, only if I can bring my boyfriend.
MRS. KIM: What?
LANE: It's both of us or neither of us. Take it or leave it.
MRS. KIM: I have only enough chairs for those invited.
LANE: You sell chairs, Mama, you have eight hundred chairs.
MRS. KIM: Fine. Bring boy. But if boy comes, I invite the Parks. They come.
LANE: I hate the Parks.
MRS. KIM: You shouldn't hate the Parks.
LANE: You hate the Parks. They're mean.
MRS. KIM: I get to hate the Parks.
LANE: Fine. If the Parks come, how about if I bring my whole band? The whole noisy lot of us. How about that? Will that work?
MRS. KIM: Yes.
LANE: What?
MRS. KIM: Bring them all!
LANE: The whole band?
MRS. KIM: Yes. See you then.
LANE: Bu -
[Mrs. Kim leaves. Lane goes back in the house.]
LANE: We're all invited to a party.
[They are all glaring at her.]



KIM'S ANTIQUES
[Lane and the band arrive on the porch.]
BRIAN: Are we early? I don't hear anything.
LANE: That's the sound of a couple dozen Christian Koreans partying down.
GIL: Trippy.
BRIAN [sees the ornament hanging on the door]: Oh, cool. Bok jo ri. They're used to separate grains of rice from small stones. They symbolically catch happiness for the New Year.
GIL: How do you know that?
BRIAN: I've done a little internet research on Korean New Year. Surf the ‘Net, there's a lot of information there.
GIL: There's also a lot of pictures of girls with tattoos on motorcycles. You would think it gets old, but it doesn't.
LANE [To Zach]: Sorry about this.
ZACH: I feel like I'm going to the dentist.
LANE: That's not an unusual thing to feel when approaching the Kim house.
ZACH: I just hope I don't throw up in the bok jo ri.
LANE: I've got your back, okay? You're not alone.
GIL: Are you sure they're home? There's not a sound.
LANE: I'm sure. Go ahead and knock. [Gil knocks.] Uh, Gil? The AC/DC ring.
GIL: Right. Sorry.
[Gil takes the ring off as Mrs. Kim opens the door.]
MRS. KIM: Hello.
LANE: Hello, Mama. I said we'd come and we've come.
GIL: I'm Gil.
[He puts out his hand to shake. Mrs. Kim looks at it.]
MRS. KIM: Yes.
LANE: And Mama, you know Brian.
BRIAN: Say hay boke-mahn he pah du say oh. [Korean New Year's blessing]
LANE: He likes the internet.
MRS. KIM: And who's this half-boy hiding behind you?
LANE: That's Zach, Mama. You've met him too.
BRIAN [pouting]: Happy New Year, I guess.
MRS. KIM: Yes. Come in.
[They enter.]
DOOSE'S MARKET – OUTSIDE
[Lorelai is walking down the street when she sees Jackson pushing Davey in a stroller.]
LORELAI: Well, lookie here, the fleet's in town. [She bends down to see Davey.]
JACKSON: Yep. We're having a little Davey-Daddy night tonight. Just the men being manly. Want to punch me in the stomach?
LORELAI: I'll pass on the punch.
JACKSON: Listen, I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
LORELAI: I don't want to pull your finger either.
JACKSON: I know now is an important time for you guys. The inn's just getting off the ground. There's a lot of extra work. But if you could just encourage Sookie to ease up a little – delegate.
LORELAI: Sookie, delegate?
JACKSON: I know. But with the pregnancy and all? And I know her hours are generally pretty good. Most nights she's home by seven. It's just these new late nights that worry me.
LORELAI: Late nights?
JACKSON: I mean not worry me, worry me. I just don't want her to overdo it.
LORELAI: Oh, sure. Sure. But, Jackson, I think Sookie left before me tonight.
JACKSON: Oh, no. She called. She said the new kitchen help's a little slow. Whatever. I know she has to do it. It's just every week now. It's no big deal. Just see if you can say something.
LORELAI: Oh. Okay, I'll see what I can do.
JACKSON [to Davey]: Okay, son. I think it's time to get you laid.
LORELAI: Oh, that's sweet. Bye, boys.
[Jackson walks away with the stroller. Lorelai turns and walks the other way.]
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE - FRONT DOOR
[Emily exits the house, dressed for the party.]
EMILY [Calling back into the house]: Gretchen, I can still smell the fish from here!
[She closes the door. Richard meets her on the driveway.]
EMILY: Well, funny running into you here. You look very nice.
RICHARD [aloof]: Thank you.
EMILY: Do you have the directions? I have an extra copy if you need it.
RICHARD: I'm fine. Thank you.
EMILY [puzzled at his formal manner]: All right. I guess I'll see you there.
RICHARD: Seems inevitable, doesn't it?
[Richard walks to his car. Emily watches him go, then gets into her car. They leave.]
KIM'S ANTIQUES
[Dining room. A large table is surrounded by Koreans eating quietly. A separate table at the end holds Lane and the boys.]
GIL: Good eats. Slimy.
BRIAN: I'm enjoying it.
GIL: I like slimy food, ‘cause it slides down easy, and I get the sense it keeps sliding, right? Which helps your colon and stuff, ‘cause it scrapes as it slides, and since it's not in you long, you don't get fat, you know?
ZACH: Just eat.
LANE: You're not hungry?
GIL: Slimy food doesn't float my boat like it does others. [He sets down his chopsticks and stands up.] I'll be right back. I have to go to the bathroom.
[The small spectacled child sitting near to them pipes up.]
KID: You're not allowed to leave the table.
ZACH: Nature's calling, kid.
KID [yells]: Nature must wait!
[Everyone at the Korean table stares at Zach.]
ZACH: How's about keeping it down, there, scooter?
KID [still yelling]: Sit ‘till we're done!
[Zach sits.]
ZACH [to Lane]: If I b*at the crap out of this little kid, will anyone care?
LANE: Mama locks the bathroom door while we eat, anyway.
ZACH: Super.
[Mrs. Kim stands up and addresses the group.]
MRS. KIM: We are done eating. There will be a thirty minute break till dessert, while Mrs. Shin and her fellow musicians play for you in the other room. Mrs. Shin, better start setting up.
[The musicians get up and start carrying their instruments into the other room.]
GIL: Look at the funky guitar! Awesome!
BRIAN: It's a Gayaguem. And if I'm not mistaken, I believe I spotted a Dahnso and a Janggoo on the way in.
[Kyon looks over from the other table.]
GIL: Man, I gotta check this out. [He starts to get up, then looks at the kid.] Can I get up?
KID: Yes.
[Gil nods and gets up.]
ZACH: Yeah, he can get up?
[The kid glares.]
KYON: You have much knowledge of Korean culture.
BRIAN [surprised]: Thanks.
KYON: That was forward of me. I should retire to my room and sleep.
BRIAN: No, don't do that. It's okay.
[Kyon and Brian both smile shyly. Zach and Lane notice everyone looking at them.]
YALE CAMPUS PUB
[Rory and Logan are sitting together, laughing comfortably.]
RORY: I can't believe you've never seen the Office!
LOGAN: I feel very stupid.
RORY: Well, you should. It's brilliant. Especially the fourth time you see
it.
LOGAN: What happens the fourth time you see it?
RORY: You can actually understand what they're saying. I have them all on DVD. You can borrow them if you want, but only if promise to abide by the fourth time rule.
LOGAN: I'll abide by your fourth time rule. If it's as good as you say, I'll raise you a fifth.
RORY: Deal.
LOGAN: Oh, here, I almost forgot your notes. [He lifts the pile of file folders out of his bag.]
RORY: Oh, I hope they helped.
LOGAN: They did. Some guy tried to mug me earlier and I b*at him to death with them.
RORY: Hey, I like my research.
LOGAN: I like your research too, and thank you.
RORY: It helped?
LOGAN: Story's done, Doyle's safe, all is right with the world.
RORY: You're welcome.
LOGAN: So.
RORY: So.
LOGAN: It's been fun.
RORY: Yeah. It has been.
LOGAN: Okay, so I should get going. I'm headed to New York.
RORY: Right. For your dad's party.
LOGAN: Yep. So, have a good weekend.
RORY: Oh, yeah. You too. Have a good weekend.
LOGAN: And hey, don't be a stranger.
[He pats her on the shoulder and leaves. She looks disappointed.]
DRAGONFLY INN - LOBBY
[Lorelai enters. Kirk is at the reception desk.]
LORELAI: Hey, Kirk.
KIRK: No messages.
LORELAI: Super.
[She heads up the stairs.]
DRAGONFLY INN – UPSTAIRS
[Lorelai comes around the corner. She listens at the door of one of the rooms. We hear the sound of a T.V. She quietly opens the door with her key. Sookie is sitting on the bed eating chocolate.]
LORELAI: Oh, behold our ghost.
SOOKIE: Okay, this isn't what it looks like.
LORELAI: I don't know what it looks like.
SOOKIE: I'm just watching T.V.
LORELAI: Because we have the convenient channel list next to the bed?
SOOKIE: No. Though it is convenient.
LORELAI: Sookie, you want to tell me what's going on? You know, before Kirk changes into his maid's outfit and starts to clean the room?
SOOKIE: A few weeks ago I read in the paper that there was going to be an episode of Dark Shadows on, the one where Barnabas is released from his tomb, and I used to love Dark Shadows, and I just suddenly really wanted to see it.
LORELAI: Sure.
SOOKIE: So, I didn't get off work in time to get home and see it, so I just came up here, and it was just supposed to be that one time, but the room was really nice, and I was really comfortable, and there were Toblerones, and I just had the best time. It was an hour all to myself, and the next week it was another good episode, and I just kinda –
LORELAI: Decided to haunt the place.
SOOKIE: I tried to clean up afterwards, and the bed was not mussed. Michel is too a**l for his own good. I'm horrible.
LORELAI: You're not horrible.
SOOKIE: I am. I'm the most horrible person in the world.
LORELAI: Well, my mother will be sad to know she's been dethroned.
SOOKIE: I'm lying to my husband. I'm eating the inn's candy!
LORELAI: You can't discuss this with Jackson? Tell him you need one night a week to yourself to watch Dark Shadows? He wouldn't understand that?
SOOKIE: Of course he would understand. That's the problem. Jackson would immediately tell me, "Sit down, relax, watch T.V" and he'll take care of Davey.
LORELAI: Huh. Men are pigs.
SOOKIE: And then I would sit there racked with guilt because he works all day too, and I would think about the fact that I'm shirking my motherly duties, and it would ruin everything. But here –
LORELAI: I get it.
SOOKIE: I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
LORELAI: Oh, don't worry about it. I do think you should tell Jackson, though. He thinks I have you chained to the stove. He's worried you're working too hard.
SOOKIE: I know. I'll go home right now and tell him.
LORELAI: Okay.
SOOKIE: Of course, it's the episode where Barnabas kidnaps Maggie.
LORELAI: And imprisons her in a coffin in the mausoleum's secret room in punishment for disobeying him?
SOOKIE: Yeah!
LORELAI: Scoot over.
SOOKIE [excited]: Really?
LORELAI: Yep.
SOOKIE: Ah, cool!
[Lorelai sits on the bed with Sookie. Sookie offers her some chocolate]
SOOKIE: Toblerone?
LORELAI: Mmm. These rooms are nice.
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm.
THE GALA – VALET PARKING STALL
[Emily drives up in her Mercedes. People are milling around the entrance. She calls after the valet, who appears to be busy with something else.]
EMILY: Excuse me, I need a ticket!
SIMON: Emily!
EMILY: Simon! Well, this is a pleasant surprise!
SIMON: Waiting for someone?
EMILY: Yes, a mysterious man with an exotic accent and a red coat to give me a ticket for my car.
SIMON: Ah. Well, I wish you a great deal of luck.
EMILY: So, who are you here with?
SIMON: My daughter and her husband. They're right over there. I'd love for you to meet them. [He waves at them.] Diana, come here for a second!
[A car smashes into the Mercedes' rear.]
EMILY: Oh! What on earth?
[She gets out of the car. Richard gets out of the other car.]
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: Richard! Have you lost your mind?
RICHARD: I misjudged the distance.
EMILY: You misjudged the distance! You hit my car!
RICHARD: I was distracted.
SIMON: Emily, are you okay?
RICHARD: I'm her husband, Simon. I'll ask her if she's okay. [To Emily] Are you okay?
EMILY: I'm fine.
RICHARD: She's fine, Simon. Are you happy? Now, go away.
SIMON: Emily, maybe you should see a doctor.
EMILY: No, I –
RICHARD: We will determine whether she needs to see a doctor. This is a family matter.
SIMON: I'll call you tomorrow and see how you are.
RICHARD: She'll be fine, Simon. She doesn't need your call. [He walks threateningly toward Simon.] Do you hear me, Simon? Don't call.
[Simon leaves. Richard grabs Emily by the arm.]
EMILY: Were you bitten by some kind of rabid animal?
RICHARD: Let's go. [To a valet] You! You! I'm taking her home. I'll come back for this car.
EMILY: You're what?
[He pulls her around to the passenger's side of his car.]
RICHARD: You were just in a car accident, Emily. You can't go to a party after having been in an accident. Let's go.
[He puts her in the car.]
EMILY: What are you doing?
[He gets in the driver's side.]
RICHARD: Maybe we should take you to the hospital.
EMILY: I think it's a toss-up who needs the trip to the hospital more.
RICHARD: When you pull up to a valet stand, you get out of the car. You don't dawdle.
EMILY: I was waiting for someone to take my car!
RICHARD: Well, you wait outside the car! Everybody knows that.
EMILY: It is not my fault that you ran into my car.
RICHARD: I know you dated him.
EMILY: What?
RICHARD: Simon McLane! I know you dated Simon McLane!
EMILY: Richard, I was just in an accident. Now is hardly the time to discuss this.
RICHARD: Fine. I found out about it in a business meeting, which was hardly the time to find out about it, but fine.
EMILY: It was dinner.
RICHARD: Dinner. Of course.
EMILY: Nothing happened.
RICHARD: Of course nothing happened.
EMILY: Stop it, Richard. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true.
RICHARD: Well, I told you that nothing happened between me and Pennilyn Lott. That all we did was have lunch. And I wouldn't have said that if that weren't true!
EMILY: Well, then, there's nothing more to be said about these things.
RICHARD: I agree.
EMILY: People are staring, Richard.
RICHARD: We're going.
[He drives away.]
KIM'S ANTIQUES
[A group of Koreans are sitting on the floor playing traditional Korean music on their Korean instruments. Gil is playing the "funky guitar". The rest of them are standing around listening, nodding appreciatively. Lane and Zach are standing in the corner, bored.]
LANE: Dessert is it. We wolf it down, we've done our duty, we're out of here.
ZACH: I'm counting the seconds.
[Mrs. Kim approaches.]
MRS. KIM: Lane.
LANE: Yes, Mama?
MRS. KIM: I need your help in the kitchen.
LANE: My help?
MRS. KIM: Food got extra stuck to pots tonight. Need you to pound the hammer while Aunt Jun holds the chisel. Come. [Lane doesn't move.] Lane, come now.
LANE: I'm watching the music, Mama. We're watching – my boyfriend and I. Maybe when it's done.
MRS. KIM: Dirty plates don't wait for Gayageum. I ask you, you come.
LANE: I'm here as a guest, and, by the way, I didn't hear you ask. I heard you demand.
ZACH: Lane –
MRS. KIM: Because you don't offer. As I taught you to.
LANE: Here we go.
MRS. KIM: Such insolence!
ZACH: Lane –
LANE: You don't get it, Mama.
MRS. KIM: Oh, I get it. You're modern woman now. Too big to chisel crust off plates. Just standing there, grooving to Gayageum.
LANE: Mama –
MRS. KIM: You have values. Values I did not teach you. Spending time with boys – living with boys! Banging drums and playing noise in a rock band with boys!
LANE: Mama –
MRS. KIM: Paint in your fingernails, gel in your hair. So vain now, you no longer even wear your glasses!
LANE: I've got contacts! I don't need them.
MRS. KIM: You're not you without your glasses.
ZACH: I agree.
MRS. KIM: What?
LANE: What?
ZACH: It's just – your glasses. I liked your glasses. You should wear them. I'm just saying.
MRS. KIM: She should wear them. She should always wear them.
ZACH: I've said it before, but it's true. They made you look smart.
MRS. KIM: Of course they made her look smart. She's a smart girl. Glasses fit her.
ZACH: Totally.
LANE: Zach –
MRS. KIM: You always looked good in them. Glasses suit her face.
ZACH: The black frames, especially with her hair –
MRS. KIM: She wore them in the first grade. She first girl in her class.
ZACH: And I bet she looked great.
MRS. KIM: I have pictures in a photo book. I could show you.
ZACH: I'd love to see them.
LANE: Wait, Zach –
MRS. KIM: Come. We chisel pots later.
[She opens a drawer and pulls out a photo album. She points to a photo.]
ZACH: Aw.
[Camera goes back to the musicians. They finish a song.]
GIL: Aw, yeah! Awesome! You guys rock. Do you know Inna Godda Davida?
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE – FOYER
[Richard and Emily enter.]
RICHARD: I'll make arrangements to get your car to the shop tomorrow.
EMILY: Thank you.
RICHARD: You might want to re-think that lease, though. [Pause] Are you sure you're feeling all right?
EMILY: I'm fine.
[Richard takes a few steps forward, then stops.]
RICHARD: I don't want to go back to the pool house.
EMILY: Come home.
[Richard turns to look at her.]
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE – PATIO
[Rory enters. Lorelai is coming from the pool house.]
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey. What are you doing here?
RORY: Friday night dinner. Is it not Friday night dinner?
LORELAI: No, I mean yes, but I thought you had a thing.
RORY: Oh, well, it wasn't a for sure thing.
LORELAI: You made it sound for sure.
RORY: It was a maybe thing, and now it's a nothing.
LORELAI: Oh, you look disappointed.
RORY: I don't want to talk about it.
LORELAI: Do you want to talk about it?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Okay. Not even to tell me who the guy is?
RORY: He's no one. Forget it.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, the mystery of the Gilmore dinners continues.
RORY: Meaning?
LORELAI: The pool house is empty.
RORY: Grandpa forgot about us again?
LORELAI: Yes! Apparently all the complexes incurred in my childhood were not enough. They need to keep a'coming.
RORY: Did you check on Grandma yet?
LORELAI: I'm on my way there now. [Gasps] Is it Marty?
RORY: Forget it, Mom.
LORELAI: Okay. But is it?
RORY: No!
LORELAI [looking in the window]: Oh – oh!
RORY: What are they doing together?
[We can see Richard and Emily talking animatedly.]
LORELAI: Are they arguing?
RORY: No – well, I don't know, they don't look mad.
LORELAI: Oh, great. I'm so not in referee mode tonight.
RORY: Grandma just laughed.
LORELAI: Eh, it could have been an evil laugh. A "I'm laughing at your pain" kind of laugh.
RORY: Looked like a plain old laugh to me.
LORELAI: Oh, Dad's picking up an ashtray. He's going to throw it at her! Finally.
RORY: No! No, he's just moving it.
LORELAI: I don't get it. What is going on? What are they doing?
RORY: I don't –
[They gasp in unison as Emily and Richard embrace.]
RORY: Holy!
LORELAI: Ah – oh my God. My parents are having an affair.
[Richard and Emily break apart as they notice the girls outside.]
LORELAI: Oh, careful, it might be a trap.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I don't know. I'm freaking out. This does not compute, does not compute.
[Richard opens the patio door.]
RICHARD: Girls! Wonderful to see you.
LORELAI: Hi.
RICHARD: Come in, come in, come in.
EMILY: Hi, you're just in time.
LORELAI: For what?
RICHARD: The celebration. [A maid enters carrying a tray.] Ah! Champagne. Perfect.
RORY: What are we celebrating?
RICHARD: Uh, should we tell them?
EMILY: They're going to find out sooner or later.
RICHARD: All right, then. Lorelai, Rory, your grandmother and I have reconciled. We are officially back together.
RORY: Really? Oh my God! [She hugs them.] That's great! I'm so happy.
LORELAI: When did this reconciliation happen?
EMILY: Yesterday.
RICHARD: And last night. And this morning.
EMILY: Richard.
LORELAI [scolding herself]: Don't ask questions. Don't ask questions. Don't ask questions!
[The telephone rings.]
EMILY: And next week your father and I are going to renew our wedding vows.
RICHARD: A week from tomorrow, on our fortieth wedding anniversary.
RORY: Aw!
LORELAI: Wow. That's great!
EMILY: And you're going to be my maid of honor.
LORELAI: Uh, wha-
[Robert enters.]
ROBERT: Excuse me, Mr. Gilmore. Mr. Jeffries from the Windsor Club for you.
RICHARD: Ah, yes. Thank you, Robert. [Robert exits.] Oh, by the way, I'm firing Robert next week.
EMILY: You won't need him.
RICHARD: No, I won't. [Answering the phone] Richard Gilmore here. [Pause] The Gold Room? Ah, yeah, would you hold on for a moment, please? Uh, Emily, they say they can free up the Gold Room.
EMILY: How are we supposed to fit a twenty piece band in the Gold Room? No, we need the Rose Room.
RICHARD: Right. [On the phone.] I'm afraid the Gold Room won't do. We need the Rose Room. [Pause] Well, perhaps they'd be willing to switch dates. We'd certainly be happy to make it worth their while. Of course, I'll hold.
EMILY: Richard, we just have to get the Rose Room.
RICHARD: Don't you worry, our company insures that building. We don't get that room, suddenly they have a very expensive foundation upgrade to go through.
EMILY: I married a wonderful man, girls.
RORY: Yes, you did.
LORELAI: Hey, Mom, about this whole, um, maid of honor thing?
EMILY: Oh, yes. Richard, can you spare us a moment? I want to take Lorelai upstairs.
LORELAI: Why?
RICHARD: Of course.
LORELAI: Wha- why do you want to take me upstairs?
EMILY: Wonderful, we'll be right back. [She pulls Lorelai up.]
LORELAI: Why doesn't Rory have to go upstairs?
RICHARD: I'll finish this phone call and then Rory and I will discuss the possibility of her being my best man.
RORY: Really? I'm going to be your best man?
LORELAI [afraid]: What's upstairs?
[Emily succeeds in pushing Lorelai up the stairs.]
UPSTAIRS
[Lorelai walks into a room filled with wedding dresses. A voice comes out from behind them, somewhere.]
CELINE [OS]: Ah, Emily. Wonderful timing. Please start with the Oscar de la Renta. Susan Hayworth never wore anything but de la Renta in her final days. Clark Gable never knew what he was missing. [laughs] He was a cad, but the crease in his pants was immaculate. [She emerges from the closet and gasps.] Oh, my God! It's Natalie Wood.
LORELAI: Hello, Miss Celine. You look wonderful.
CELINE: Olive oil on the inside and on the outside. Anna Manana taught me that.
EMILY: I think this has too much lace, Celine.
CELINE: Ah, there can't be too much lace, as long as it's Italian. What do you think, Natalie?
EMILY: What do you think?
LORELAI: Whatever you want, Mom.
EMILY: Lorelai! You're my maid of honor. I need your opinion here.
LORELAI: Well, I kind of like that one, or even the one next to it.
EMILY: I'll try them both. [She takes them into the dressing room.]
CELINE: You'll try them all. I had the worst row with Dietrich once. I told her, "Marlene, until you actually become a man you must try dresses on like a woman." And that means all of them.
[Lorelai laughs politely.]
CELINE: Are you married, Natalie?
LORELAI: Oh, no, not yet.
EMILY [OS]: Actually, Celine, she just opened her own business. She owns an inn now.
CELINE: Hmm, an inn, how charming.
[Lorelai begins perusing the dresses. Celine wanders over to an accessory box and pulls out some silicone bra implants.]
CELINE: Emily, do you need breasts or are yours sufficing for the moment?
EMILY [coming out wearing the lace-covered dress]: I'm fine for the moment, Celine.
CELINE: Oh, my God, you're Mary Martin. Take it off immediately.
EMILY: Oh, dear.
LORELAI: Here, try this one on, Mom.
EMILY [OS]: You know, I'm trying to decide whether to go with a hat or some sort of headpiece, or whether that's too much.
CELINE: When I was dressing Marilyn for her wedding to Arthur Miller, I told her, I said, "Marilyn! Wear a flat hat on your head. It will remind him of a book." She didn't, and we all saw how that turned out.
LORELAI: You wear whatever you want, Mom.
EMILY: Celine, I'm going to need some help with this zipper.
[As Celine helps her, Emily watches as Lorelai holds a dress up to herself and checks herself in the mirror.]
CELINE: Oh, very elegant. Very nice, oh. There you go, Mrs. Oscar Lavant, love that. Here, try the Dior just for giggles, hmm?
EMILY: All right.
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke is lying in bed.]
LUKE: I will never, under any circumstances, no matter how short a dress you put on, go back to Al's Pancake World ever, ever again.
LORELAI [OS]: Aw, you didn't like your manicotti?
LUKE: That was not manicotti, it was square and flat and blue.
LORELAI [OS]: Yeah. Manicotti's rarely blue.
[Lorelai comes out of the bathroom.]
LUKE: You know, I've been thinking, uh, maybe I shouldn't go to this thing of your parents'.
LORELAI: First Al's Pancake World, and now my parents vow renewal?
LUKE: I'm serious. I'm not really their favorite person. They don't really want me there.
LORELAI: Hey, I'm not their favorite person either, and I still have to go.
LUKE: I know, it's just – it's going to be this big fancy thing with all their friends. And, you know, I just –
LORELAI: Listen. My parents are very weird people. They don't hate you. They just don't know you. This is the perfect opportunity. They'll be happy. They'll be smashed. You show up, shake some hands, get in a few family pictures, and before you know it my mother will be trying to convince you you're too good for me. [Luke sighs.] Come on, it'll be fun. Good food. Open bar. I'm wearing a fabulous dress and as maid of honor, if you're not there, I'll have to get drunk and make out with the best man. Who is Rory. So you can see all the creepy ramifications of your absence here.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay? [Luke nods.] Okay. [She gasps, seeing the T.V.] Hey! You got a T.V.!
LUKE: Oh. Yeah.
LORELAI: Since when did you get a T.V.?
LUKE: I just picked it up this morning.
LORELAI: What about your REM sleep?
LUKE: Hey, twice a week you're going to bed at 9:30 like a 72-year-old woman because I have early deliveries, so I figured the least I could do is make sure you don't miss your Charlie Rose or your Patrick Stewart –
LORELAI: Jon Stewart.
LUKE: And plus, I can sleep through anything. Once I'm out, I'm out.
LORELAI: Oh, I know.
LUKE: So, here. [He hands her the remote.] Enjoy.
LORELAI [turning on the T.V.]: You are too good for me.
LUKE: Well, maybe I'll meet a nice girl at your parent's wedding.
[Lorelai glares as he turns off the light, then settles in to watch T.V.]
CHRISTOPHER'S APARTMENT
[Gigi is on the floor watching Teletubbies. Chris is working on a laptop. There is a knock at the door. Chris gets up to answer it.]
CHRIS: Emily. Wow, this is a surprise.
EMILY: May I come in? [She walks in.]
CHRIS: Yes, please come in. I didn't even know you knew where I lived.
EMILY: I know all kinds of things. [She looks around.] Obviously you have a maid.
CHRIS: Yes, I have a maid-nanny combo.
EMILY: Ah. How McDonald's of you.
CHRIS: Uh, can I get you something? A tea, or coffee, or –
EMILY: I'm fine, thank you. [She looks down at Gigi.] So, this is the child.
CHRIS: Yes, this is Georgia. We call her Gigi.
EMILY: And her mother's still gone?
CHRIS: Yes. She's in Paris.
EMILY: All right. I'll come straight to the point, Christopher. Now, I have known you a long time. I watched you grow up. You were a charming boy. A weak, but charming boy. And to be completely honest, I never thought much of you. I still don't.
CHRIS: Wow. That's great of you to come by and share that with me.
EMILY: However, you have good breeding. You come from an impeccable and you love Lorelai. You've always loved Lorelai. You would've married her when she got pregnant. I know that. And you would have married her if that girlfriend of yours hadn't gotten pregnant with this. [She gestures at Gigi.] I know that too. Lorelai's in a relationship now, did you know that?
CHRIS: Yes, I know that.
EMILY: He owns a diner. He's a divorcee. He's uneducated, he's not a proper stepfather for Rory and he's completely unsuitable for Lorelai. My daughter is stubborn, but she's capable of greatness. And watching her settle down with a man who could hold her back from that is unacceptable. You, at least, won't hold her back.
CHRIS: Okay, Emily, I'm very confused by this speech of yours, and Gigi needs to be fed.
EMILY: She's getting serious with this man. I've seen it with my own eyes. If you want a chance with Lorelai you had better do something. And you had better do something now. [She places an envelope on the table.] Timing has never been your strong point, Christopher. You should see if you can change that. Goodbye, Gigi. Enjoy your program.
[She leaves. Chris picks up the envelope and opens it.]

LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is on the phone.]
LUKE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You don't? Well, when are you going to get it in? Fine. Two boxes of annular thread silicon pronged boat pads. [Lorelai enters.] A band saw. A wood rack, and a jack plane. Yeah, I'll hold.
[Lorelai waves. Luke grunts.]
LORELAI: Eh? Apparently now we've been married for forty years?
LUKE: Sorry. This stupid boat supply place does everything but actually supply anything.
LORELAI: Oh, catalogues. I love catalogues.
LUKE: It's boating parts. Yes, yes, I'm here! [Pause.] None of them. Man, you must have a lot of room in that place of yours. Yeah, sure. Backorder it. What the hell.
LORELAI: Oh! Look at these boots!
LUKE: Let's try twenty C-clamps, five inches or larger. A box of quarter inch teak buns, marine caulk.
LORELAI: And the boots. Get the boots.
LUKE: Yeah, go check. I'll hold. [To Lorelai] What are you babbling about?
LORELAI: I want these boots.
LUKE: Those are work boots.
LORELAI: They're yellow and cute. I'll look like the Morton's Salt girl.
LUKE: How the hell did you find something to buy in my boat supply catalogue?
LORELAI: Size nine, please?
LUKE: Yes, I'm here. None of them? Well, at least you're consistent. Okay, backorder all of them. Yes, the C-clamps, the teak buns, the marine caulk - [rolls his eyes at Lorelai, who is kissing the boots in the catalogue.] - and one pair of fisherman's boots, size nine. [Lorelai raises a fist in victory.] Of course, those you have. Okay. Send them right along. Uh-huh. [He hangs up the phone.] They'll be here Tuesday.
LORELAI: Aw, you didn't have to do that.
LUKE: Hey, is it okay if I come over tonight and work on the boat a little?
LORELAI: With what? Sheer masculinity and some imaginary sandpaper?
LUKE: I have plenty to do until the backorder stuff gets here.
LORELAI: All right. I thought you were going to spend the evening trying to figure out how to fling yourself down the stairs just hard enough that you won't have to go to my parents' thing tomorrow, but not so hard that you actually die.
LUKE: No, I thought instead that I'd try to find a wild boar to maul me just enough that I'll need medical attention so I won't be able to go to your parents' thing tomorrow, but after some stitches and a transfusion, I'll still be able to make you coffee.
LORELAI: Oh, much better plan.
LUKE: I've started to run the rigging. I just wanted to get a little further on it.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Rory's spending the night. We're having a Cop Rock marathon.
LUKE: Okay. Here's your donuts.
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: And your coffee.
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: And my final plea to not make me go to this thing tomorrow.
LORELAI: [Pause.] You do not have to go.
LUKE: Fine. I'll go.
LORELAI: I love it when I break you with just the sheer anticipation of a wear-down!
LUKE: Hold on, did you say Cop Rock marathon?
LORELAI: Yeah, I got 'em all on tape. [Pause.] Trying to figure out what you see in me?
LUKE: Yep.
LORELAI: Wait'll you see me in the boots.
[She exits.]
OPENING CREDITS
LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
[Rory and Lorelai are preparing a feast of frozen waffles, pop tarts and similar food. Rory's laptop is set up at the table and she is burning CD's as they "cook".]
LORELAI: Okay, I know I was the one that said I was craving mashed potatoes, but, oh my God, they're a lot of work.
RORY: It's instant mashed potatoes. Key word: instant.
LORELAI: Oh, no, not instant. I have to mix water and butter into it, not to mention the adding of salt and pepper.
RORY: OK The Best of Super Furry Animals complete.
LORELAI: Oh! Plus I have to rip the package open, dump it into a bowl and, oh my God, are they serious? I have to stir the mixture to combine? What is this, the Gulag?
RORY: Hey, do you want the Arcade Fire?
LORELAI: I don't know, do I?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Then yes. So basically once I'm finished with all this manual labor, I still have to clean the bowl.
RORY: And the spoon.
LORELAI: What do I use the spoon for?
RORY: Stir to combine.
LORELAI [Waves her hand around in the bowl.]: Pfft. Right. What do I use the spoon for?
RORY: Oh, my mistake. Carry on.
LORELAI: So let's cut to the chase. How badly do you want these mashed potatoes?
RORY: You wanted the mashed potatoes.
LORELAI: 'Cause with tater tots I can just rip and dump.
RORY: Then stick with your strengths. Brain Master Eno coming up next.
[There is a knock at the back door.]
LORELAI: Who is it?
LUKE [OS]: It's me.
LORELAI: Me who?
LUKE [OS]: Rory, can you just open the door? [She does.] Do you have an extension cord I can use?
RORY: I'll go look.
[Rory exits.]
LORELAI: Hi! Come on in.
LUKE: No, that's all right. I don't want to disturb you guys.
LORELAI: Oh, you're not disturbing us.
LUKE: Well, I'm dirty.
LORELAI: Well, so's the house.
LUKE: And if I come in there I'll see what you guys are planning on eating and I'll want to k*ll myself.
LORELAI: It just so happens I am making a garden spring salad with three bitter lettuces and a breaded French country chicken.
LUKE [Sarcastic]: Really, you are?
LORELAI: No. So how's the boat coming?
LUKE: Slow.
LORELAI: Oh, well, you should've built a motorboat.
RORY [returning]: Extension cord.
LUKE: Thank you. I'll let you get back to taking five years off your life.
LORELAI: Meh. They were the five where I would've been wearing fuschia lipstick way beyond my lip line, so I wouldn't want 'em anyhow.
[They kiss.]
LUKE: See you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Ten-thirty sharp.
[Luke leaves. Lorelai puts the tater tots in the oven.]
LORELAI: Okay. First course ready?
RORY: Ready!
LORELAI: Let's Cop Rock.
[They head for the living room. The phone rings. Lorelai answers it.]
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: I picked up my dress from the dressmaker and it's a disaster.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: I got it home and it's falling apart. I need you to fix it.
LORELAI: Uh, but -
EMILY: I'm coming over.
LORELAI: No, Mom, I -
EMILY: Yes, I need you to fix this.
LORELAI: I'm not the woman who made it. Make her fix it.
EMILY: When a woman gives birth to a crack baby you do not buy her a puppy.
LORELAI: What does that mean?
EMILY: I want this dress to be perfect for tomorrow, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Yes, Mom, but -
EMILY: It's the most important day of my life, Lorelai!
LORELAI: It's not even the most important day of your marriage!
EMILY: I'll be there in half an hour, Lorelai. [She hangs up.]
LORELAI: No. Hello? Mom? But - [She hangs up.] She's coming over.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Because she won't buy her seamstress a puppy.
RORY: Oh, sure.
LORELAI: Something about her dress. Crap, what are we going to do?
RORY: I don't know!
LORELAI: We can't eat all of this before she gets here.
RORY: Most of it.
LORELAI: Sure, most of it.
RORY: But not the tater tots or the pizza tower.
LORELAI: Okay, we'll have to do the evening in two parts. We'll watch one Cop Rock, eat this stuff here, she'll come over, I'll get her dress done as fast as I can, then we'll continue with our evening.
RORY: Maybe we should put it off.
LORELAI: She comes, I fix, she goes, we Rock. Now eat.
RORY: Hmm. [She reaches for a pop-tart.]
LATER - OUTSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Luke is sanding the boat in the garage. Emily drives up. She notices him there, and walks up to Luke. When he notices her behind him, he is surprised and drops the sander, still running, on the ground. He struggles to turn it off.]
LUKE: Oh! Hi, Emily. I just - I didn't see you standing there. I'm just working on my boat.
EMILY: You're building a boat?
LUKE: Yes.
EMILY: Does it float?
LUKE: Not yet.
EMILY: Aren't boats supposed to?
LUKE: Eventually, yes.
EMILY: Well, at least you have a hobby.
LUKE: Yes. Thank God for that, huh?
EMILY: Idle hands, and whatnot.
LUKE: It will float eventually.
EMILY: Oh, I'm sure it will.
LUKE: I just have to do a little more -
EMILY: Well, I should get inside.
LUKE: Yeah, it's nice seeing you again.
EMILY: Yes.
LUKE: Oh! Uh, congratulations.
EMILY: For what?
LUKE: You know, your thing tomorrow, renewing your vows.
EMILY: You congratulate the groom. You offer the bride best wishes.
LUKE: Oh. [Pause.] Uh, best wishes.
EMILY: Why, thank you, Luke. How sweet of you to say. I'll see you tomorrow.
LUKE: Hey, I'm looking forward to it.
[Emily frowns a little, then walks toward the house.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE - INSIDE
[Emily knocks on the door. Lorelai answers it.]
LORELAI: Mom, great. Come on in. Okay, so, is that the dress?
EMILY: Yes, yes -
LORELAI: Okay, well, let me take a look here.
RORY: Hi, Grandma. Big day tomorrow, huh?
EMILY: That wasn't your dinner, was it?
RORY: No, that was just the appetizer.
EMILY: Oh, well that's a relief.
LORELAI: Mom, I don't see anything wrong.
EMILY: Lorelai, are you blind? Look!
LORELAI: Where?
EMILY: Right there. [She points.] That bead and that bead and that bead, all loose.
LORELAI: Okay, I see it now. I don't know how I missed it. Well, this is going to take me no time at all, five minutes tops.
EMILY: Well, don't rush it.
LORELAI: No, no, no rush. It's an easy job. Three and a half minutes and you're on you're way. You don't even need to sit down, because by the time you do, this'll be done. In fact you should have just left the car running 'cause that's how quick this is going to be. [She bolts up the stairs.]
RORY: So how you holding up, Grandma?
EMILY: I'm a wreck, actually.
RORY: Why?
EMILY: Well -
LORELAI [From upstairs]: Two minutes and we're done!
EMILY: I still can't decide exactly what to do with my hair, and I have absolutely zero faith that my wedding planner is going to be able to pull this off -
LORELAI [returning with her sewing things]: Thirty seconds - someone clock me. [To Emily, who is taking off her coat.] What are you doing?
EMILY: Do you have anything to drink?
LORELAI: No, no, Mom, why are you taking off your coat?
EMILY: Some wine, or some chilled vodka, perhaps?
LORELAI: Yeah, but you might want to hold off on having a drink, Mom, 'cause you're going to be driving in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
EMILY: Well, I could use a little something. Calm my nerves about this wedding planner I hired.
LORELAI: I'm sure everything's going to be fine.
EMILY: I don't see how it can be, everything is so last minute, and I didn't even get a decent rehearsal!
LORELAI: Mom, I promise you, I have successfully walked in a straight line at least once before. I can get you the cop's name if you want to talk to him.
EMILY: Oh, well, it's too late to do anything about it now. [She gets up to go into the kitchen.]
LORELAI: No, no, Mom. Wait, I'm almost there, I'm almost there! I'm done, I'm done, I'm done!
[The phone rings.]
LORELAI: Stop her from getting a drink.
RORY: How?
LORELAI: Show her Nick Nolte's mug sh*t. [Answering the phone.] Hello?
[Scene cuts between Lorelai's living room and Richard's study, where there is a group of men smoking cigars and playing cards in the background.]
RICHARD: Lorelai! How are you?
LORELAI: I'm fine, Dad, how are you?
RICHARD: Oh, don't you worry about me. I am in good hands. Isn't that right, boys?
MAN: Right!
LORELAI: Geez, Dad, hanging out at the bath house again?
RICHARD: I am at my bachelor party, Lorelai, and I just thought I'd call and see how your little gathering was going.
LORELAI: My -
RICHARD: Now, I want you to have a wonderful time, and go as crazy as you think is necessary. But make sure your mother doesn't mix her alcohol. Sometimes when she has a little bit too much vodka, she forgets and she goes on to gin. I need her sober and looking beautiful for tomorrow.
MAN: Otherwise you don't have to go through with it. [They laugh.]
LORELAI: So, Dad, Mom told you we were having a party?
RICHARD: Well, she told me she was heading over to your house this evening to spend a little time with "the girls", so I put it all together. I'm a very brilliant man, Lorelai. Anyhow, I won't keep you any longer. Just return your mother in one piece, sans tattoos, please.
LORELAI: Okay. Will do.
RICHARD: Have a scandalous time. I'll see you girls tomorrow.
[They hang up.]
LORELAI: Okay, so here's a fun twist for your viewing pleasure. My father thinks my mother is here for her bachelorette party.
RORY: What? Why does he think that?
LORELAI: I think she told him that.
RORY: Oops.
LORELAI: Ah, were we supposed to throw her a bachelorette party?
RORY: I don't know. You're the maid of honor. Aren't you supposed to plan these things?
LORELAI: I didn't think you had a bachelorette party when you hadn't been a bachelorette for forty years. Oh my God, she is going to hold this against me for the rest of my life.
RORY: So what do we do?
[Lorelai sighs and looks in the direction of the kitchen.]
LATER - INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE
[The doorbell rings. Lorelai answers it. Sookie is standing outside, holding a dish and leaning her head against the doorframe.]
SOOKIE: Davey had just fallen asleep.
LORELAI: I know, I'm sorry. Thank you for coming over at the last minute. Is that -
SOOKIE: Potstickers.
LORELAI: Ah, I love you.
RORY [Walking by, in the hall]: Hi, Sookie!
SOOKIE: Mmhmm.
LORELAI: Go on in the living room.
SOOKIE: Okay. [She starts walking out the door.]
LORELAI [Turning her around]: The other living room.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: You're going to have to open your eyes now.
SOOKIE [entering the living room]: Okay.
[Gypsy arrives at the front door.]
GYPSY: Hey, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hey, Gypsy. Thanks for coming on such short notice.
GYPSY: I'm always up for a good party.
LORELAI: Emily is in the living room with the others.
GYPSY: Great. Who's Emily?
LORELAI: Follow me, I'll point her out.
GYPSY: Okie dokie.
[They enter the living room. Emily is laughing on the couch with Patty and Babette, drinking from plastic cups.]
LORELAI: Look, everyone, it's Gypsy!
EMILY [drunk]: Gypsy! Gypsy's here! Everyone, Gypsy's here!
LORELAI: Gypsy, that's Emily.
EMILY: Come on, Gypsy, come over here and sit by me.
GYPSY: Okay.
[Babette moves. Gypsy sits next to Emily.]
EMILY: I have to say, Lorelai, I am loving this drink. Have you ever had one of these, Gypsy?
GYPSY: I don't know.
EMILY: It's called a rum and coke.
BABETTE: You know, you may look high-brow, Emily, but underneath, you're just a broad.
[Rory walks in with a plate of tater tots.]
EMILY: Did you hear that, Gypsy, I'm a broad.
GYPSY: Yeah, I always suspected.
RORY [To Lane and Kyon, sitting quietly]: How's it going?
LANE: Great.
KYON: What are we doing here?
LANE: I tried to explain it to her, but it's not working.
RORY: We are throwing my grandmother a bachelorette party.
KYON: But she is married.
RORY: Yeah, but they're doing it again.
KYON: But why?
RORY: Because they want to tell each other that they love each other all over again.
KYON: But why?
RORY: Because they do.
KYON: But why?
RORY: Because it's fun.
KYON: But why?
RORY: Because - [She looks at Lane.]
LANE: Hey, you lasted one more 'But why' than I did.
PATTY: So, Emily, tell us about this party of yours tomorrow.
EMILY: It's going to be fabulous. Isn't it, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Ab fab, sweetie darling.
EMILY: Isn't she hilarious? I never have any idea what she's talking about, but she's so entertaining! Like a chimp. Isn't she like a chimp, Gypsy?
GYPSY: Please make your mother stop talking to me.
LORELAI: If only I had that power.
EMILY: The party is going to be very, very big. Flowers everywhere, and my dress is incredible. The woman who made it is a genius.
[Lorelai and Rory exchange a look.]
BABETTE: So where's it going to be?
EMILY: The Windsor Club.
SOOKIE: Ooh, fancy.
BABETTE: Well, that ain't no toilet bowl.
EMILY: No, it certainly is not. It is the perfect place to have my perfect wedding. And what I had to go through to get it, let me tell you. [She goes to take a sip of her drink.] Lorelai, the cup's empty!
[Lorelai gets up immediately to refill her drink.]
EMILY: It was booked up two years in advance, and the Sheldrakes had the Rose Room. They were having a retirement party or something like that, [Lorelai pours extra rum in Emily's cup] and they simply refused to let us have the room. They were stubborn, and selfish, and now, after all the strings I pulled, they are across town at the Bluestone Club, with their piped-in music and their pornographic fountains.
[Emily and Patty laugh.]
PATTY:
EMILY: I must say this is the best bachelorette party I ever had.
SOOKIE: I really feel like we should play games or something, or have naughty gifts like edible underwear or dirty-shaped pasta.
LORELAI: Yeah, too bad - oh, oh! [She gets up.] Just a sec.
EMILY: Where is she going? Gypsy, where is she going?
[Gypsy looks uncomfortable.]
LORELAI: Aha!
SOOKIE: What are you doing?
RORY: No way!
SOOKIE: Where did you get that?
LORELAI: You gave it to me.
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah. [She giggles.]
LORELAI [handing Emily the box of pasta]: Mom, for you on your special night.
EMILY [taking it]: What's this? Oh my God! Oh my God!
[She laughs, along with Patty and Gypsy.]
KYON: What are they laughing at?
LANE [picks up a plate]: Have a tater tot, Kyon.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - MUCH, MUCH LATER
[Rory is cleaning up dishes in the living room. Babette is passed out on the chair. Lorelai tiptoes down the stairs.]
LORELAI: My mother is fast asleep in my bed, clutching my Hello Kitty pillow, and yes, I have pictures!
RORY: I cannot believe how much rum Grandma drank tonight.
LORELAI: How much rum she drank? [She opens up a purse.]
RORY: Hey, that's Grandma's bag. [Lorelai pulls out a book.] What are you doing?
LORELAI: I have no idea, I am drunk. [She skips into the kitchen.]
RORY: Hey! Come back here with that. [She follows her mother into the kitchen, looks in her room where Sookie is asleep. She closes the bedroom door.] What are you doing?
LORELAI: There is no way I'm sitting next to Missy Hollargan.
RORY: Stop that, that's Grandma's seating chart! [She goes to the fridge to get Lorelai some water.]
LORELAI: I know, I'm just fine-tuning it. Oh, the Ramsey's divorce must be legal by now. Time for a little reunion.
RORY: You're evil and I'm going to tell.
LORELAI: Well if you tell, then I'm going to tell cousin Drew, aka the Power Spitter, that you like him.
RORY: You're mean.
LORELAI: Hmm. Man, I'll say one thing for my parents, they certainly command a good turnout.
[Rory sees Logan Huntzberger's name on the seating chart. She smiles.]
RORY: Hey, do you think the Sheldrakes will be unhappy at the Bluestone Club?
LORELAI: Oh, I have no idea. However, I do know that Dinky Shaw is going to be sitting next to her ex-husband's daughter from his second marriage. This is the daughter whose conception caused the second marriage. And everybody should bring an extra roll of film.
RORY: Seems mean. Getting them kicked out like that. Seems mean.
LORELAI: Seems Gilmore.
RORY: Mom -
LORELAI: Rory, this is how it works in my parents' world. Trust me, the Sheldrakes are busy screwing someone at the Bluestone out of something as we speak.
RORY: If you say so.
LORELAI: These people live in a universe where they feel entitled to get what they want, when they want it, and they don't care who's in their way. I hate that world. Vapid. Selfish. It's like that Life and Death Brigade you wrote about.
RORY: What do you mean?
LORELAI: You know, like a bunch of selfish rich kids, the children of entitlement, blowing off school. Drinking for days. Spending thousands on a stupid and potentially dangerous stunt, knowing full well that they're not going to get in trouble, 'cause Daddy is important. They're all the same.
RORY [Defensive]: They're not all the same. You don't even know them. And that's not what I wrote. I didn't say all those things about them. You're just reading whatever you want to into it.
LORELAI [confused]: Okay, sorry.
RORY: Just because you have money, that doesn't automatically make you a jerk.
LORELAI: I know. I didn't mean it like that. [She sighs] So, new subject?
RORY: Yeah, new subject.
LORELAI: Hey, I wonder if my mother would notice if she and Dad were suddenly at different tables. [Rory gives her a look.] Okay.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - MORNING
LORELAI [Calling downstairs]: Hey, have you seen my Sparkly Venom lip gloss?
RORY [OS]: Yes, I have, it's at school.
LORELAI [OS]: Well, as long as it's safe.
RORY [OS]: Hey, what time is it?
LORELAI [OS]: Ten thirty-five. Rats!
[Someone knocks on the door.]
LORELAI [OS]: Rory, can you get that?
RORY [OS]: I'm not dressed yet!
LORELAI [OS]: You're not? It's ten thirty-five!
RORY [OS]: So?
LORELAI [OS]: Finally, that childish punctuality of yours has worn off.
RORY [OS]: Stop.
LORELAI [OS]: My baby's a woman.
[Luke tentatively opens the door.]
LUKE: Hello?
LORELAI [OS]: Luke?
LUKE: Uh, yeah. The front door was open.
LORELAI [OS]: I'll be right there.
RORY [OS]: Hi, Luke!
LUKE: Hey, Rory. You know your front door was open? It wasn't like that all night, was it?
LORELAI [Coming down the stairs.]: Hey! You look nice!
[They kiss]
LUKE: You're not dressed.
LORELAI: No, I'm getting dressed there.
LUKE: I didn't know you could get dressed there.
LORELAI: Rory, let's motor!
[Rory comes out of her room.]
LUKE: I would have gotten dressed there.
RORY: 'Kay, I'm ready. Hey, you look nice.
LUKE: Yeah, I didn't know you could get dressed there.
LORELAI: Don't worry about it.
LUKE: You didn't mention there was a place to get dressed there.
LORELAI: Oh, we're late. Let's go!
LUKE: Wait, aren't you going to lock up?
LORELAI: Babette, lock up when you leave?
[Babette's head pops up from the other side of the couch.]
BABETTE: You got it, honey! [To Luke] Oh, you look nice.
WINDSOR CLUB
LORELAI: Oh, please let them not be here yet.
RORY: They'll be here.
LORELAI: Well, you tell them you were running late.
RORY: You were running late too.
LUKE: My pants are all wrinkled from the ride.
LORELAI: Do you see them?
RORY: No.
LUKE: It looks like I slept in them.
LORELAI: Hey, stop being such a Nancy-boy about the pants. Think Hemingway ever gave a crap what his pants looked like?
LUKE: Hemingway blew his brains out, also. How much of a role model do you want me to make this guy?
[Emily and Richard walk toward them.]
EMILY: Well, there they are.
RICHARD: Hello, girls.
LUKE: Apparently they're going to change here also.
LORELAI: Sorry, um, Rory had a little emergency.
RORY: So did Mom.
EMILY: I hope everything's all right.
LORELAI: Yes. Just fine. How is everything going?
EMILY: Utter disaster. That moronic wedding planner finally fulfilled her potential. I get here and I go through my seating chart, and it's a mess. It looked like a drunken psychopath took a stab at it. I had to re-do the entire thing. It took me two hours and years off my life.
LORELAI: Maybe she just got confused.
EMILY: She did get confused. Confused about what her profession should be. Anyway, I fired her. That should help clarify things for her.
RORY: Third realm of hell, party of one.
LORELAI: Mom, how could you fire her now? Who's going to run the wedding?
EMILY: Well, luckily Marilyn came into town early for the ceremony, and she offered to help out.
RICHARD: You know that Marilyn was a very intimate friend of Cecil b*at. He named an end table after her.
LORELAI: Hmm.
EMILY: And on top of all that, even though we managed to get the Sheldrakes out of the Rose Room, the women's club that owns this place has their still life painting class at four today in the Salon, and they refuse to give it up.
LORELAI: Are you using the Salon?
EMILY: Of course we're not using the Salon. What on earth would we use the Salon for? Oh, Luke. You're here.
LUKE: Uh, have been, actually.
EMILY: Richard, did you see Luke?
RICHARD: No. Why, Luke, there you are.
LUKE: Hey, Mr. Gilmore. Best wish- congrat- nice suit.
RICHARD: Thank you, Luke. I can have my tailor steam out those trousers for you.
EMILY [laughing]: Oh, Richard, that's not what he's wearing to the ceremony. I'm sure he's going to change. All right, girls. Let's go get settled.
LORELAI [to Luke]: Are you okay to hang here for a while?
LUKE: I'm sure. I'm fine. You go.
[A woman walks over to them.]
MARILYN: Emily. The florist is here and everything looks fabulous.
EMILY: Really?
MARILYN: No. But it will. [gushing] Lorelai, you look divine. Oh, and Rory. That skin. Gorgeous, I can't find the words. And who is this?
LORELAI: Oh, Marilyn, this is Luke. Luke, this is my cousin Marilyn.
LUKE: Nice to meet you.
MARILYN: You, too. [Pulls Lorelai aside.] Is he a gardener?
LORELAI: Uh, no, he owns a diner.
MARILYN: Oh, I've always wanted to have an affair with a gardener. Apparently that's very 'in' now.
EMILY: Marilyn, we're going to the bridal room now.
MARILYN: And I have gardenias to deal with.
RICHARD: I'll see you in a little while. I'll be the handsome one holding the ring.
EMILY: My favorite kind of man.
[The women go. Richard calls Lorelai back.]
RICHARD: Psst, Lorelai. I need you to do something.
LORELAI: Oh, spy voice. Cool.
RICHARD: Focus, please?
LORELAI: I am a camera.
RICHARD: I want to give your mother a present. But I don't know what her dress looks like. So, I need you to take these [He pulls out two necklaces], wait till she's not looking, hold them up to the dress, pick the one that looks best, bring it back to me and I will give it to her. Got it?
LORELAI: Got it.
RICHARD: Go.
[She goes. Richard looks at Luke, who is fidgeting with his pants. He walks away.]
BRIDAL ROOM
[Lorelai walks in with her hands behind her back. She pulls out the necklaces.]
LORELAI: Which one do you want?
EMILY [points]: That one, the other for my birthday.
RORY [gasps]: Look at that, it's so fancy.
EMILY: Your grandfather has perfect taste in necklaces and earrings. It's very important to find a man who can pick out your jewelry.
LORELAI [whispers to Rory]: Or steal it.
[Lorelai heads for the door.]
EMILY: Where are you going?
LORELAI: Uh, to give Dad back the necklaces.
EMILY: Hang your dress up first.
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: I'm going to go change.
LORELAI: Great. Come back as Thora Birch.
EMILY [sits down at the vanity]: Oh, Lord, look at that. Pierre has his work cut out for him today.
LORELAI: Stop it, Mom, you look gorgeous.
EMILY: Lorelai, why am I doing this?
[In reply, Lorelai holds up the necklace.]
EMILY: Oh, yes. It is pretty, isn't it?
LORELAI: It's pretty frickin' awesome is what it is.
EMILY: Oh my God, I'm so nervous, I haven't eaten a thing all day.
LORELAI: Do you want me to whip up a little pasta for you, Mom?
EMILY: Stop that. Maybe I should take a Seconal.
LORELAI: Excellent idea, Judy. All right, my dress is hung.
EMILY: Make sure you hurry back. Lisette will be here to do your hair any minute.
LORELAI: My hair is already done.
EMILY: Don't worry. She can fix it.
[Lorelai gives her a look.]
EMILY: I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I'm just so nervous, I can't think.
LORELAI: Why are you nervous?
EMILY: I'm getting married!
LORELAI: For the second time. Mom, it's a pretend wedding. J.Lo has them all the time!
EMILY: Well, it certainly feels like a real wedding. After all, we've been separated for months. I'd almost forgotten what it was like to have a man around the house. Oh, God, I missed him. It's a wonderful thing to have a husband, a partner, somebody who's always there. Oh, Lorelai, don't you think you'll ever want to be married?
LORELAI: Well, um - [smiles] actually, I do.
EMILY [shocked]: Well, that's nice.
RORY [coming out of the dressing room in her 'tux']: Best man in the house!
EMILY: Oh, my goodness, Rory, you absolutely look adorable!
LORELAI: Say, aren't you the culture q*eer Eye guy?
EMILY: Ignore her, you look dashing.
LORELAI: Yeah, now go buy me some earrings.
RORY: I like it.
LORELAI: Hey, it's not fair that she gets to dress like that.
EMILY: Your dress is beautiful.
LORELAI: Yeah, but she gets to wear, like, a costume. Can't I dress like your maid? It'll be whimsical and I can wear flats.
EMILY: Go give the necklaces back to your father.
LORELAI: You so like her better.
[Lorelai leaves.]



MAIN ROOM - CEREMONY
[A string quartet plays as the congregation waits for the ceremony to begin.]
MARILYN: So, tell me, Luke, have you ever considered being a gardener?
LUKE: Uh, I'm not much good at growing things.
MARILYN: Oh, Luke. That's the least important part of being a gardener.
[The judge, Richard and Rory enter from a side door and take their places at the front. The congregation turns around to watch for the women to come from the back. Lorelai walks down the stairs and down the aisle, winking at Luke before she takes her place. Rory notices Logan, and smiles happily. The congregation rises to welcome Emily, who smiles as she takes Richard's hand at the front.]
JUDGE: May you all be seated, please. [They sit. As the judge talks, Rory notices the girl next to Logan lean over and whisper in his ear. Logan laughs. She appears jealous.] I have known Richard and Emily Gilmore for twenty years now. I know them to be two of the most formidable opponents the world has ever seen. They complement each other. They defend each other. They were made for each other. And today, in front of friends and family, Richard and Emily have chosen once again to say to each other, "I choose you". [Luke and Lorelai smile at each other.] How many of us in a lifetime even get chosen once for something we really want? [Christopher enters late and sits down, trying not to draw attention.] Richard and Emily, will you please face each other. Please repeat after me. I, Richard Gilmore.
RICHARD: I, Richard Gilmore…
[Fade to black.]
RECEPTION HALL
[Lorelai and Luke enter with Rory. Joyous music and laughter can be heard.]
LORELAI: And over here we have the Romanov table.
LUKE: Wow. Look at those flower arrangements. This thing must've cost a fortune! They're real orchids.
LORELAI: A little gayer, please.
LUKE: I'm just saying.
MARILYN: Oh, wasn't the ceremony perfect? The candles and that judge. I should have married him. I was such a snob, I wouldn't have a civil servant. [To Luke] You're saving a dance for me. [She leaves.]
LUKE: Oh my God, there's dancing?
LORELAI: Yeah. We're doing the one from Pulp Fiction. Do you want to be Uma, or should I?
RORY: I'll meet you guys at our table later.
LORELAI: Table five, hon.
[Rory goes.]
LORELAI: Aw, man. I've already seen ten people I hate, twenty people I know whose names I can't remember, and forty people I don't know but who will expect me to know them anyhow.
LUKE: A bar. Thank God. [They go over to the bar.]
LORELAI: Hey, I need you to run major introduction interference for me.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Well, you have the advantage. No one knows you here, you can't insult them by forgetting their names. [To the bartender] Vodka tonic.
LUKE: And a beer.
LORELAI: Someone comes up, I'll take a drink. My mouth will be full, I can't talk. How would that look, right? Then you jump in, offer your hand. [In a deep, "man" voice] ‘Hi, Luke Danes. And you are?' ‘I'm Mr. Blockenfeffer.' By then I will have swallowed. ‘Oh hi, Mr. Blockenfeffer, I'm Lorelai, remember me?' ‘The bane of your mother's existence?' ‘Exactly. Nice to see you again.' ‘Nice to see you again. And nice to meet you, Luke.' ‘Nice to meet you, Mr. Blockenfeffer.' ‘You kids have a lovely evening.' ‘No, you have a lovely evening. Our love to Mrs. Blockenfeffer.' Oh, look.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: My Aunt Totsy. Mmm. Lovely woman. She hugs you, you smell like her for a month.
LUKE: Yep. [To the bartender] Keep these coming.
LORELAI: Thanks.
[Rory is standing in the middle of the room, looking around. She sees Logan getting a drink at the bar, and follows him discreetly to his table. She hides behind a man and peeks around him to get a better view of Logan and the blonde girl he is with.]
MAN: Actually, it's not that difficult at all. You just start with the siblings and count down even generations. The children of siblings are first cousins, the grandchildren of siblings are second cousins and so on. That makes you and Ceci third cousins, because Mee-maw and your great-great aunt Mary were sisters. See? Now, if the generations aren't even, that's where you indicate with ‘removed'. For example, you're Trip's second cousin, but Trip's daughter is your second cousin, once removed. So if Ceci ever has grandchildren, you'll be third cousins twice removed, whereas they will be my second cousins thrice removed, and my great-grandchildren's fifth cousins. See, it's not
[Rory wanders away. Lorelai and Luke are talking to a couple.]
BRUCE: I'm Bruce McAllister, and this is my wife, Susan.
LUKE: Well, it's very nice to meet you, Bruce, and Susan.
LORELAI [swallowing]: Hi, Bruce, remember me? Lorelai?
BRUCE: Yes, it's nice to see you again.
SUSAN: Well, we should find our table. We'll talk to you later?
LUKE: Okay. ‘Bye, Bruce. [They shake hands.]
LORELAI: ‘Bye, Susan. [They walk away.] That's what I'm talking about. [They look around.] Mmm. Whoops, Marilyn's getting Totsied. [She forces Luke to turn around to avoid someone.] Oh! How are you doing? You having a good time?
LUKE: It's okay.
LORELAI: Um, I have to tell you something.
LUKE: Are you okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, um, [whispers] Christopher's here.
LUKE: Oh, well, I guess he knows your parents, so ¯
LORELAI: Yeah, but, um, so Christopher's father died a couple weeks ago, and, um, he took it pretty hard. He had a terrible relationship with the man. [She looks over at Chris.] I went over there one night. The night before the re-enactment. Um, I brought tequila and we talked and drank, just two old friends hanging out. That's all.
LUKE: You went over there?
LORELAI: To comfort him. I know I should have told you about it, I just didn't because I didn't want you to read anything into it, or think anything weird, and I'm only telling you now because he's here and it might come up, and I don't want you to feel shanghaied.
LUKE [glaring]: Yeah, that would be bad.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, Luke. Nothing happened. Please believe me.
[Christopher joins them.]
CHRIS: Hey, Lor.
LORELAI: Hi, Chris. You know Luke.
CHRIS: Uh, no, not really. I'm Christopher.
LUKE: Yeah. Heard a lot about you.
CHRIS: You, too. The coffee is legendary.
LORELAI: Luke and I are dating.
CHRIS: That's great.
LORELAI: Have been for, what, four months now? Man, time, it flies when you're having fun, huh? Big fun. Nothing sexual intended, although ¯
LUKE: Sorry about your dad.
CHRIS: Yeah. Thanks.
LORELAI: I told him about your dad, and the tequila.
CHRIS: Oh, yeah. It was rough, Lorelai helped me a lot, just being there.
LUKE: She's a very considerate person.
LORELAI: Hey, who likes my dress? ‘Cause, man, you should have seen the one my mother wanted me to wear.
LUKE: You're cutting off my circulation.
LORELAI [Letting go of his arm]: I'm sorry.
CHRIS: Hey, so where's that kid of ours?
LORELAI: Uh ¯
EMCEE: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to present to you for the first time, this century, Mr. and Mrs. Richard Gilmore.
[Everyone claps.]
LORELAI: Well, we should take our seats, now, see you later, Chris.
CHRIS: We'll have a drink.
LORELAI: Be great.
[Chris watches Lorelai and Luke head to their table and Emily and Richard make their entrance.]
LORELAI: Something wrong?
RORY: Coffee sucks.
[Richard takes the microphone. Emily takes a seat facing him.]
RICHARD: Thank you. [clears his throat.] On behalf of myself and my second wife, Emily, I would like to thank you all for coming here to help us celebrate. You are good friends, and we are very, very lucky. Now, in planning our traditional first dance, I gave a lot of thought to the song that would represent the next phase in our marriage. The best phase in our marriage, I believe. [Emily blows him a kiss.] I went over all the greats ¯ Bennett, Sinatra, Chuck Berry ¯ and a story popped into my head. Now, most of you know my daughter, Lorelai. When Lorelai was three, she went through a period of having chronic ear infections. It was terrible. Screaming all night long, we couldn't keep a nanny longer than a week.
LORELAI [to Luke]: Yeah, that was the terrible part. The searing pain was just a side note.
RICHARD: And so, it fell to Emily to sit with her all night long. She tried everything to calm her down. Finally, she found a song that seemed to soothe her. It was a popular song on the radio and it soon became Emily's favorite. Of course, it drove me crazy ¯ some woman complaining about how she wanted to marry a man named Bill. Not exactly Cole Porter. Emily would tease me, saying, ‘If only your name was Bill, then this could be our song.' Well, Emily, for tonight, and tonight only, my name is Bill, and this is our song. Hit the button, Johnny. [He pulls her to her feet.] Your hand, madam.
EMILY: I cannot believe you remembered this song.
[Richard and Emily dance. Chris stares over at Lorelai and Luke, and orders another drink. Rory stares at Logan and the blonde.]
Bill, I love you so, I always will
I look at you and see the passion eyes of May
Oh, but am I ever gonna see my wedding day? (Wedding day)
I was on your side, Bill, when you were losing
I'd never scheme or lie, Bill, there's been no fooling
But kisses and love won't carry me till you marry me, Bill
EMILY: We should separate more often.
RICHARD: Oh, bite your tongue.
I love you so, I always will.
And in your voice I hear a choir of carousels
EMCEE: At this time, if you're in love, I invite you to join Emily and Richard on the dance floor.
Oh, but am I ever gonna see my wedding day?
LORELAI: You wanna dance?
LUKE: No, thanks.
LORELAI [serious]: Please? I promise I will dance just as spazzy as you will.
LUKE: I do not dance spazzy.
LORELAI: Then I will be the only spaz on the floor. Please?
LUKE: I do not dance spazzy.
LORELAI [smiles]: Thank you.
[They get up. Christopher glares after them.]
But kisses and love won't carry me
Till you marry me, Bill
I love you so, I always will
And though devotion rules my heart I take no bows
But Bill, you know I wanna take those wedding vows
Come on, Bill, Oh, come on, Bill
[Rory sees Christopher get up and leave. She follows him.]
SALON
[The still life painting class is meeting.]
RORY: Want some company?
CHRIS: Hey, kiddo. Have a seat.
RORY: Quite a party, huh?
CHRIS: I would expect nothing less from your grandparents.
RORY: Pretty flowers.
CHRIS: Yes. Not at all fake.
RORY: Like my suit?
CHRIS: I do. It's very Bugsy Malone.
RORY: So how you doing?
CHRIS: Me? Oh, I'm fine. Just ¯ [pause] Did your mother ever tell you about our first kiss?
RORY: No.
CHRIS: We were fourteen. It was after school in the parking lot of the AM/PM. She just walked right up and kissed me.
RORY: Really?
CHRIS: Yep. Said she just wanted to know what it would be like.
RORY: I hope you at least bought her a Moonpie.
CHRIS: You know, it never would've crossed my mind to do something like that. Just walk up and kiss someone, ‘cause you wanted to. But Lorelai ¯ she always knew what she wanted. And she'd go out and get it.
RORY: She never told me that story.
CHRIS: No. Probably wanted to make me seem more manly.
RORY [smiles]: Did you ¯
CHRIS: Did I what?
RORY: Did you like it that she kissed you first?
CHRIS: Who could not like being kissed by a Gilmore girl? It was the greatest day of my life. [Rory looks thoughtful. He finishes his drink.] I'm going to get a refill, can I get you something?
RORY: No. I'm fine.
CHRIS: Okay, well, I'll see you back in the center ring.
RORY: Okay.
[Chris goes. Rory sits for a minute longer.]
RECEPTION HALL
[Lorelai and Luke are dancing.]
LUKE: Okay, there's a touch of spazzy in there. Can we stop dancing now?
LORELAI: We can. Uh, but Marilyn is standing right behind you and if we swap she's going to swoop in, there's nothing I can do to save you.
LUKE: Well, funny how Marilyn's been standing right behind me where I can't see her for the last two songs.
LORELAI: Yeah, I know. That woman is spooky.
LUKE: This wouldn't be some underhanded ploy of yours to keep me dancing, would it?
LORELAI: Why, Luke Danes, I am appalled at the insinuation. I should walk off this dance floor right now and leave you to your fate. But I'm much too sweet a person to do that.
LUKE: Uh-huh.
[The song ends and a slower one starts.]
LUKE: Much better. Lowers the spaz quotient.
[Rory walks purposefully across the dance floor, straight to Logan's table.]
LOGAN: I like the suit, Kashmir.
RORY: I didn't know you were going to be here.
LOGAN: Really? I thought you put my name on the list.
RORY: No.
LOGAN: Oh, well, it must be your grandparents invited me. My parents are around here somewhere.
RORY: Oh, so you came with your parents?
LOGAN: Yup.
RORY: And ¯
LOGAN: And, what?
RORY: Where's the blonde?
LOGAN: She's at the bar.
RORY: Oh, yeah, she's pretty.
LOGAN: Yeah? You want me to hook you up?
RORY: No, I was just saying ¯
LOGAN: What are you just saying?
RORY: That she's pretty. That you brought a pretty girl. She's pretty, and the two of you are pretty together. In case you were wondering.
LOGAN: Jewel's a friend of the family, I've known here forever. She's visiting her parents in town, and she had nothing to do, so she asked to tag along. We're not dating.
RORY: Do you want to dance?
LOGAN [gets up]: After you.
[They walk past Luke and Lorelai.]
LUKE: What's that?
LORELAI: Ugh, Totsy alert! Move, move!
[They rush off the floor. Rory and Logan look at each other while dancing.]
LOGAN: What?
RORY: Why did you come?
LOGAN: Open bar.
RORY: Quite a draw for a guy with an American Express black card.
LOGAN: Live band, salad, butter pats ¯
RORY: Logan ¯
LOGAN: Little knit bags full of those Jordan almonds ¯
RORY: Are you ever going to ask me out? [No answer.] You flirt with me. You act like you like me a little. You show up here, with a friend, not a date. I mean, aren't you? Ever? [Pause.] You do like me, right? [Logan smiles.] Oh. Okay. Uh, no problem. [She tries to pull away; he doesn't let her.] I'll just, um, let you go back to your table, and I'll just start burrowing directly into the ground.
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: I should be in China by midnight.
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: You called me Rory.
LOGAN: I want to be clear.
RORY: Oh, good.
LOGAN: I have thought about asking you out, several times. I just don't think it's such a good idea.
RORY: Why not?
LOGAN: Because you're special.
RORY: Special, like ‘Stop eating the paste', special?
LOGAN: You are beautiful. You are intelligent. You are incredibly interesting. You're definitely girlfriend material. I, however, am definitely not boyfriend material. I can't do commitment, and I don't want to pretend to you that I can. If I were to date you, there would be no dating. It would be something, right away, and I'm not that guy.
RORY: But' I'm not looking for anything something like.
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: I'm not. I've done that. As a matter of fact, I just did that, and that's not what I want.
LOGAN: I'm not saying you want that right now.
RORY: No, I don't want that at all. No, I'm not expecting anything. I'm just I like you, and I want to spend some time with you. No strings attached.
LOGAN: No strings attached, huh.
RORY: Hey, girls just wanna have fun. Stringless fun.
LOGAN: You may feel like that now, but ¯
RORY: I do feel like that now.
LOGAN: Okay, but ¯
[Rory grabs his hand and pulls him off the dance floor.]
LOGAN: Where are we going?
RORY: How should I know? What, do you think I have a plan or something? Geez. [She grabs a bottle of champagne from the bar.] Live in the moment, Huntzberger. [She walks toward the exit, then looks back at him.] Coming?
[Logan looks around, then follows her.]
BRIDAL ROOM
[Rory enters, followed by Logan. She closes the door.]
RORY: Champagne?
[Logan takes a sip and gives the bottle back. Rory drinks.]
LOGAN: Look, are you sure you want to do this?
RORY: I just want to know what it would be like.
[She kisses him. Logan looks her up and down.]
LOGAN: I feel like I'm kissing a guy.
[Rory rolls her eyes and kisses him again.]
LOGAN: And apparently I had no idea what I was missing.
[They kiss again.]
RECEPTION HALL
[Guests are clinking their glasses. Emily laughs, and she and Richard kiss. Lorelai returns to their table with drinks.]
LORELAI: Here you go. Oh, no. You've been Totsied.
LUKE: Well, you left me alone.
LORELAI: I warned you about her.
LUKE: I turn around, she's headed right for me, what am I supposed to do?
LORELAI: Ugh, man.
LUKE: It's not that bad.
LORELAI: Yeah, of course not.
[Christopher joins them.]
CHRIS: Thought I'd come by for that drink. Man, you've been Totsied! [He snickers.] Didn't you warn him?
LORELAI: I tried. Moves slow.
CHRIS: Don't worry about it, man, we've all been there. Lorelai and I went to a funeral, we got Totsied twice! You remember?
LORELAI: Um, no.
CHRIS: No? Come on, it was raining. You were wearing your ‘Hell is for children' t-shirt, your mom flipped because we snuck that flask in?
LORELAI: Huh, sorry, no memory at all. [To Luke] You want to dance?
CHRIS: Dance? Get second-hand Totsied, Lor. You know you should burn that suit when you get home. Hey, how's the Inn? [To Luke] You know, we had lunch at the Inn last month.
LUKE: I know.
LORELAI: The Inn is fine. Everything is fine.
MARILYN: Honey, so sorry to interrupt. Your parents want a picture of just the wedding party in front of the cake before they cut it.
LORELAI: Okay, I'll just, uh, go find Rory.
MARILYN: I think I saw her heading off that way with that darling blonde boy. I've forgiven her for not noticing that I was chatting with him earlier.
LORELAI: Really, well, I'll go get Rory and meet you back at the cake.
LUKE: I'll go with you.
[Chris tosses back the rest of his drink and follows.]
HALLWAY
[Lorelai looks for Rory. Luke is right behind her.]
LUKE: Listen, uh, I think we need to talk.
LORELAI: I know, I know. We will. I just ¯ let me try to find ¯
[She opens the door to the bridal dressing room. Rory and Logan pull apart.]
LORELAI: Hm. Grandma wants a picture.
RORY: Of this?
LORELAI: Rory, what are you doing?
RORY: Mom ¯
LORELAI: You're at your grandparents' wedding! Renewal ¯ vowal ¯ thing. Whatever. They're right out there. God, Rory, I swear!
CHRIS: Rory? Rory's in here?
LORELAI: Okay, don't, Chris, it's all right.
CHRIS: What the hell are you doing in here with my daughter?
LOGAN: I ¯
CHRIS: Get away from her. That is my daughter! I will kick your ass! I will kick your ass, you little weasel!
[Lorelai pushes him out of the room.]
LORELAI: Get out!
LUKE: What the hell is going on?
CHRIS: Who's that guy, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Christopher, calm down! You're drunk!
CHRIS: Calm down? There's a guy in there pawing my daughter!
LUKE: What guy? There's a guy in there with Rory?
[He barges into the room. Logan and Rory are collecting their things.]
LORELAI: Oh, my God, Luke!
LUKE: Hey! Get your hands off her. I mean it. Right now! Hands in the air, I want to see hands in the air!
LORELAI: Out!
[She slams the door and smiles at Logan and Rory.]
LORELAI: I think you guys better use the back way out of here.
RORY: But, Dad ¯ Luke ¯
LORELAI: I will take care of Dad and Luke. Please go, now, go! [Rory goes, Logan hesitates.] So, um, you must be Logan.
LOGAN: Uh, yeah.
LORELAI: I'm Lorelai.
LOGAN: Nice to meet you. Okay, well, I'd better ¯
LORELAI: Yeah.
[He leaves, she opens the door.]
CHRIS: It's none of your business what's going on with Rory.
LUKE: It sure the hell is my business.
LORELAI: Oh, guys, please!
CHRIS: Rory is my daughter. Mine.
LUKE: Oh, really? Well then, where the hell were you when she got the chicken pox and would only eat mashed potatoes for a week, or where were you when she graduated high school, or started college? Huh? Who the hell moved her mattress into her dorm, and out of her dorm and back into her dorm again?
LORELAI: Luke, please. This is not the time.
CHRIS: Where I was doesn't concern you. Rory is my daughter, and Lorelai's daughter, and that's it.
LUKE: Well, I'm with Lorelai!
CHRIS: For now!
LUKE: What does that mean, for now? What is that, a threat?
CHRIS: Lorelai and I belong together. Everyone knows it! I know it, Emily knows it!
LUKE: What?
CHRIS: Look, I blew it, okay? I know that I blew it. [To Lorelai] You waited, and I didn't come through, and now you're with him. But it's not too late!
LORELAI: Chris, don't.
CHRIS: It's not too late. I know it's not too late. Emily told me it wasn't too late! [Luke glares at Lorelai. She looks guilty.] I mean, that's why I'm here, okay? I know you're with him. But it's for now, it's not forever. It's just for now. I know that.
LORELAI: Luke, I don't know what he's talking about!
LUKE: I got to get out of here.
LORELAI: Oh, Luke, wait ¯
CHRIS: Please, just, just ¯
LORELAI: Christopher, get out of my way!
[She chases after Luke.]
RECEPTION HALL
[Lorelai is looking for Luke. Christopher is chasing after her.]
CHRIS: Will you stop?
LORELAI: Get away from me, Christopher.
CHRIS: I just want to talk.
LORELAI: Get some coffee, Christopher!
CHRIS: This wasn't the way I wanted it to go down. I wanted to get you alone and ¯ what are you doing?
LORELAI: I'm going after Luke!
MARILYN: Oh, there you are! [Calling to Emily] I've got her! [She pulls Lorelai toward the cake.] Oh, you cannot keep a room full of Anglo-Saxons waiting for cake this long! They start to form more clubs. [To the photographer] Take her, take her, take her!
PHOTOGRAPHER: All right, wonderful. There we are. [The four of them are lined up ¯ Rory, Richard, Emily and Lorelai.] Okay. Everyone, in just a little closer. That's perfect, hold that.
LORELAI [leaning into to whisper in Emily's ear]: You and me, we're done.
PHOTOGRAPHER: One, two, three.
[Emily is shocked, and turns to look at Lorelai as the camera flashes.]

CHRIS: Will you stop?
LORELAI: Get away from me, Christopher.
CHRIS: I just want to talk.
LORELAI: Get some coffee, Christopher!
CHRIS: This wasn't the way I wanted it to go down. I wanted to get you alone and – what are you doing?

RORY: Are you leaving?
LORELAI: Party's over. It is so over.
RORY: Are you okay?
LORELAI: Yeah. I'm fine. It's just time to go.
RORY: Are we okay? I mean, that wasn't exactly my proudest moment.
LORELAI: Aw, honey. You're the daughter of a woman who has had no end of less than proud moments. Don't worry.
RORY: Luke was so mad.
LORELAI: That's because to Luke you're still ten years old wearing feathered angel's wings going door-to-door inviting people to a caterpillar's funeral.
RORY: Oh, now, I did that once.
LORELAI: Luke is fine.
RORY: I hope so.
LORELAI: Look, go back in. Catch up with Logan. Tell him everything is fine.
RORY: He went right to his car, he split.
LORELAI: I don't blame the boy.
RORY: And what's with you and Grandma?
LORELAI: All these questions!
RORY: Sorry.
LORELAI: Look. Go back in, huh? Make the best of things. Luke is just, um, bringing the car around. I'll talk to you later.
RORY: Are you sure we're good?
LORELAI: Always.
RORY: 'Kay. Bye, Mom.
LORELAI: Bye, mister. [Rory goes back in. To attendant] Oh, excuse me. I'm going to need a cab, please?
ATTENDANT: Yes, ma'am.
PHOTOGRAPHER [rushing forward]: There you are. I'd love to get a few more shots in.
LORELAI: Yeah, so would I. [She leaves.]
OPENING CREDITS
STARS HOLLOW - STREET OUTSIDE LUKE'S
[Lorelai pulls up in a cab. Some funky music is coming from the diner. She walks up to the door and knocks. She can see Caesar eating at the counter. He comes to let her in.]
LORELAI: Hi.
CAESAR: I was just on my break.
LORELAI: Oh, that's no problem. Caesar, listen -
CAESAR: I clocked out too, so it should say so on my time card.
LORELAI: Right.
CAESAR: Although the ink is kinda weak and faded. It's really hard to see.
LORELAI: That's fine. Great. Caesar, is Luke back yet?
CAESAR: Didn't you guys go somewhere tonight?
LORELAI: Yeah.
CAESAR: Did you get separated or something?
LORELAI: Something like that. So have you seen him?
CAESAR: Not unless I fell asleep. And I never fall asleep.
LORELAI: Well, so if you didn't fall asleep you know for a fact he's not back.
CAESAR: Right. So you didn't come back together, huh?
LORELAI: Long story. Getting kinda late, so -
CAESAR: If I see him, should I tell him to call you?
LORELAI: Yes, please.
CAESAR: Okay. And, if you talk to him, could you maybe not mention the radio, or eating the pie? He hates when I eat out of the pie plate.
LORELAI: You were eating out of the pie plate?
CAESAR [hesitates]: No. No.
LORELAI: Well, thanks, Caesar. See ya.
CAESAR: I've got lots of work to do, and I'm hankering to get to it.
LORELAI: Okay. Bye.
[Caesar goes back into the diner. Lorelai turns to head down the street.]
BABETTE: Lorelai! Hey!
LORELAI: Hi! Babette! Hey, Morey.
MOREY: Hey, Lorelai.
BABETTE: Look at you all dolled up and walking the street. I'm not calling you a hooker or nothing.
LORELAI: Well, thank you. Hey, um, did you guys pass Luke, or see his truck any time tonight?
MOREY: Uh-oh.
BABETTE: You're not with Luke?
LORELAI: Not at the moment.
BABETTE: Uh-oh.
LORELAI: What?
BABETTE: Didn't you go to your parents' wedding thing tonight?
LORELAI: Yes.
MOREY: Uh-oh.
LORELAI: What?
BABETTE: You didn't come back together?
LORELAI: Well, of course we did. We're just not together at the moment.
BABETTE and MOREY: Uh-oh.
LORELAI: Would you guys stop doing that?
BABETTE: Everything's all right between the two of you, isn't it?
LORELAI: Of course it is.
BABETTE: I hope so.
MOREY: Otherwise Taylor would go crazy.
BABETTE: He's got all these contingency plans, remember, in case you guys split? He's worried what it would do to the town. Big a**l creep.
LORELAI: Well, there's no splitting happening here. Everything's fine.
MOREY: Good.
BABETTE: Well, we'd better be going. Take care, doll.
LORELAI: Talk to you guys later. Bye. [They walk away. She takes out her cell phone and dials a number.] Luke, it's, uh, me. Again. Uh, well, another very exciting night comes to a close, huh? Um, I don't think you're home, so I'm going home. Um, I'll leave my cell phone on, or call me at home. Anytime you want. 'Kay. Bye. Er - just please, call me, okay? 'Bye. [She hangs up, and looks back into the diner. Caesar is dancing to the radio.]
YALE - RORY'S DORM
[Rory enters and turns on the light. She checks the message board, then flips through some papers by the phone.]
RORY: Paris!
[She opens Paris' bedroom door.]
RORY: Paris. Paris!
PARIS [asleep]: Wha?
RORY: Are you asleep?
PARIS [mumbles]: Don't turn the light on. [Rory turns the light on.] Aah! I said don't turn the light on!
RORY: I didn't hear the ‘don't'.
PARIS: Why do you think I would tell you to turn on the light when I'm dead asleep?
RORY: I didn't know you were dead asleep.
PARIS: The room is dark. I'm under the covers and completely immobile. Deduce, Sherlock.
RORY: Well, you're awake now. Can I ask you a question?
PARIS: Bite me.
RORY: Were there any messages for me?
PARIS: Yes. Four other people called and asked that you bite me.
RORY [sighs]: Look, I'm serious here. Come on, Paris. It is especially important tonight that, if there was a message for me, that that message gets to me.
PARIS: If there was a message, I would have left it on the message board.
RORY: The board is blank. And you are not the most reliable message leaver.
PARIS: No messages.
RORY: Okay. I don't mean to insult you, but are you maybe telling me there's no message because you're mad that I woke you and there really was a message?
PARIS [sits up]: Oh, my God, you're annoying tonight! [She notices Rory's suit.] What's with being all k.d.lang?
RORY: It was for my grandparents' vow renewal. I was the best man.
PARIS: Is that kinky or something?
RORY: It was a cute thing.
PARIS: So, who's the boy?
RORY: What boy?
PARIS: The boy you're dying to get a message from. I assume it's a boy.
RORY: Not necessarily.
PARIS: Well, no one called, left a note, smoke signaled, Morse coded, semaphore flagged or came by. Male, female or hermaphrodite. [She flops back into her bed.]
RORY: Okay, thanks.
PARIS [getting up]: I'm wide awake. It's your fault. You owe me Boggle.
RORY: Paris -
PARIS: Boggle!
RORY: One game and then it's back to bed!
STARS HOLLOW - STREET
[Lorelai walks along. She stops to stare at Kirk playing a dancing game in the video arcade. Kirk finishes his dance and wipes his face with a towel.]
KIRK: Hey, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Kirk, you're dripping wet.
KIRK: Sweat is the curse of the b-boy. Mos Def. So, are you feeling better?
LORELAI: Yeah. I'm feeling fine, why?
KIRK: Luke told me you weren't feeling well.
LORELAI: Luke? You've seen Luke?
KIRK: He came into the movie theater. I'm on my break, so I figured I'd come down and bust a sweet move.
LORELAI: When, when?
KIRK: Oh, about a half hour ago. [He hands her the towel.] I asked about you and he said you weren't feeling well. Then he rejected my 'buy two Junior Mints, get a free hunk of onion beef jerky' offer with a disgusting profanity, then took a seat.
LORELAI: So, he's there now?
KIRK: Probably. Nothing's up with you two, is there? I mean, you seem just fine.
LORELAI: No, nothing. Nothing's wrong at all.
KIRK: Uh-oh.
LORELAI: Kirk, we have not broken up.
KIRK: Well, why are you guys dressed up but not together? Luke's in a suit, which seems awfully formal for a movie theater that recycles its popcorn -
LORELAI: Oh, well, we had a fancy event to go to, um, then I got the sniffles, and so Luke decided to see a movie, but now I'm feeling better, so I came looking for him.
KIRK: I hope that's true, 'cause Taylor would go nuts if you two broke up.
LORELAI: Well, that is not the case, so there's nothing to worry about. Do you think he's still there?
KIRK: The movie just started when I left.
LORELAI: Great. Thanks a lot, Kirk. So I can go in without paying?
KIRK: No!
LORELAI: Thank you. [She hurries away.]
KIRK: My towel!
[He fans his face with his hands, then heads back into the arcade.]
BLACK, WHITE AND READ MOVIE THEATER
[Lorelai sneaks in. The movie is playing. Luke is sitting alone on the 'Big Red' couch. Lorelai joins him. He sighs.]
LORELAI: What are you watching?
LUKE: Something stupid.
[They watch the movie for a minute.]
LORELAI: Man. They sure talked fast in these things.
LUKE: Yep, they, uh, they did. Fast.
LORELAI: I have been frantically trying to call your cell phone.
LUKE: I turned it off.
LORELAI: That's what I figured. [Pause] So do you want to hear my explanations, 'cause I've got 'em. Explanations, perspective, apologies, I've got 'em all, and I'm dying to share them with you.
LUKE: I just need some time.
LORELAI: Time -
LUKE: A little time, to think.
LORELAI: And to process.
LUKE [nodding]: Right.
LORELAI: I get that. I get that. I just have so much I want to say to you.
LUKE: Not right now. I need to clear my head.
LORELAI: You'll call me when you're ready?
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Okay. Good. Okay. So, I should - [She gestures toward the door and gets up. Luke ignores her. She stops to look at him before she leaves.]
DRAGONFLY INN - LOBBY
[Lorelai is showing a guest around.]
LORELAI: - Figure as your little girls arrive, we'll have them here in the living room. We'll have the pocket doors to the dining room closed. Then, when it's time for breakfast, we'll open the doors, and voila, the full, beautiful effect.
WOMAN: Wonderful.
LORELAI: We'll have music with a nice little fanfare. You like Yanni?
WOMAN: Hate him with every fiber of my being.
LORELAI: Oh, good, we're in perfect sync. And then, we'll have small-scale tables set with china, a silver tea service, little plates, little cups, and twelve little chairs for all of them to sit on.
WOMAN: That's so cute.
LORELAI: Yeah.
MICHEL: Wait, twelve? I thought there were six. Six little girls.
LORELAI: Six girls and their six dolls.
MICHEL: I beg your pardon?
LORELAI: This is a pancake breakfast for the girls and their dolls.
MICHEL: Get out of town.
LORELAI: I thought you knew that.
MICHEL: Dolls, as in they don't have stomachs, lungs or spleens? And we are serving them breakfast?
LORELAI: That's right.
MICHEL: Teeth? Throat? Colons? They don't have these things either? Unless they are Brides of Chucky.
LORELAI: I'm not paying attention to you anymore. [To the woman.] All right, well, I'll order everything, and all you have to do is show up.
WOMAN: The girls are looking forward to this. So are the dolls!
LORELAI: Aw, love that.
WOMAN: 'Bye.
LORELAI: Okay, bye.
MICHEL [watching her leave]: Is she psychotic?
LORELAI: Shh.
[They head into the kitchen.]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Lorelai and Michel enter. Sookie is preparing stuffed peppers.]
LORELAI: It's silly fun, Michel, girls love dolls. Chill.
SOOKIE: I'm making little pancakes for the dolls, and I found these little forks they can use.
MICHEL: They do not have opposable thumbs!
SOOKIE: Who, the girls? Oh, this is a handicapped group! Poor things.
MICHEL: No, the dolls.
SOOKIE: The dolls? How can a doll be handicapped?
MICHEL: My point exactly! They are plastic and made in Banglagor!
LORELAI: We're doing this. So hop on board, or hop off.
MICHEL: Okay! You don't need to snap my nose off! [He leaves.]
SOOKIE: He's getting on your nerves, huh?
LORELAI: Completely. I'm starving.
SOOKIE: Didn't you have anything at Luke's today?
LORELAI: Not today. There's no food in this fridge.
SOOKIE: It's stuffed with food.
LORELAI: Food that's edible. Food to consume. Everything in here you have to cook.
SOOKIE: I'm a cook.
LORELAI: Oh, forget it.
SOOKIE: What's wrong?
LORELAI: Nothing. Luke and I had a little disagreement last night.
SOOKIE: At the wedding? What happened?
LORELAI: Christopher showed up.
SOOKIE: Oh, no.
LORELAI: My mother invited him.
SOOKIE: Oh, no!
LORELAI: And I hadn't exactly told Luke about that tequila night with Chris after his dad died, so I told him and there was a big blow-up. Chris went nuts, Luke went nuts, and he got mad, and he left. And now he says he needs time to think.
SOOKIE: How much time?
LORELAI: He just said, 'Time'.
SOOKIE: Ooh, I hate when men do that. It's so vague.
LORELAI: I should have told him when it happened. But I blew it. Now, if he'd just give me ten minutes we could hash it out and be back on our way, and not waste time. What's enough time?
SOOKIE: I don't know.
LORELAI: It's been twelve hours. That enough?
SOOKIE: I'd say no.
LORELAI: I'll be distracted until we fix this.
SOOKIE: Well, don't worry, because when a relationship is right, things work out.
LORELAI: I hope so.
SOOKIE: I heard about this couple on one of those morning show, similar to you guys - all lovey-dovey, perfect for each other, you know, headed for marriage - and something happened, and they broke up in their senior year of college, even though they were madly in love with each other. They moved to different parts of the country. They married different people.
LORELAI: They married different people?
SOOKIE: Oh, had kids, grandkids. Then their spouses died, oh, and they were available again, and they talked and they hooked up, and now they're together and they're happily in love after forty years apart. Uh!
LORELAI [shocked]: That's a horrible story!
SOOKIE: No, it's not!
LORELAI: What morning show was that on? I hate that story!
SOOKIE: But they ended up together!
LORELAI: Was it Katie Couric? She seems very dark to me.
SOOKIE: The point is that even if it takes forty years to figure it out, there's still a chance for a happy ending!
LORELAI: But that's all they had! An ending! I don't want to have just an ending with Luke!
SOOKIE: I know, but -
LORELAI: I don't want to have those stupid kids or those ugly grandkids with that loser other guy!
SOOKIE: You don't know, he could be a nice guy.
LORELAI: Even if he's a nice, guy, he's not the guy I want to be with!
SOOKIE: You're right. It's not fair to him.
LORELAI: It's not fair to him, it's dishonest.
SOOKIE: We should name the other guy. I feel like he'd be a Larry.
LORELAI: We're not naming the other guy.
SOOKIE: Okay. I guess it was a bad example. Sorry.
LORELAI: Oh, it's okay.
SOOKIE: But you know, I read a story about another guy that had a fight with his girlfriend, and he said he needed like a week to think it over, and he only needed a day. And he and the girl were back together and were happy forever. No Larry, or loser kids, or anything.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
SOOKIE: They don't put stuff like that in the newspapers, 'cause it's not as sexy as the forty year story, but it happens all the time, really.
LORELAI: Thanks for making that up.
SOOKIE: You're welcome.
LORELAI: I'm going to go take a walk. I've got some errands to run.
SOOKIE: Good. Clear your head. And it was Katie Couric.
LORELAI: I knew it.
[Lorelai leaves.]
YALE CAFETERIA
[Rory and Paris are collecting bowls of different kinds of cereal.]
PARIS: Don't forget the raisin bran. It's good for you. Keeps you moving.
RORY: Whatever that means. Ew, I just got what that means!
PARIS: Cognitive k*ll are slow today. Grab some Corn Flakes. Nietzsche and Lichtenstein went ape guano over Corn Flakes.
RORY: They make you smart, German and depressed. Why do they have so much Wheat Chex? It doesn't go with anything.
PARIS: Wheat Chex are sort of the pumpernickel bread of the cereal world.
RORY: Well put. So what combo are you thinking today?
PARIS: Cap'n Crunch over a foundation of Rice Krispies, with a perimeter of Shredded Wheat.
RORY: Bold.
PARIS: I like its prospects.
RORY: I love cereal.
PARIS: It rocks.
[Rory takes her phone out of her pocket and sets it on the table as they sit down.]
PARIS: So, you never told me who the guy was.
RORY: Guy?
PARIS: The guy you were dying for a message from? The guy who has you yoked to your cell phone?
RORY: I am not yoked to my cell phone. I can't hear it when it's in my pocket.
PARIS: Oh, God! Tell me it's not Huntzberger.
RORY: What if it is?
PARIS: With the hair, and the chin like he's the fourth Bee Gee?
RORY: You know, I could put the phone away if it's bothering you.
PARIS: Don't. That pathetic boat you're in? I'm first oarsman. [She pulls out her cell phone and puts it on the table.]
RORY: How so?
PARIS: I'm waiting for Doyle to call. I expected a call yesterday to set something up for last night, but it never came. So I ate a family-sized bag of salt and vinegar potato chips and went to bed at seven-thirty.
RORY: That was the smell.
PARIS: We're better than this, you and me. We're the children of Emma Goldman and Hillary Clinton. Strong, independent. We're better than this.
RORY: Apparently not.
PARIS: I blame Chilton. Great education, but horrific socialization. We need guidance.
RORY: I'm not calling Love Line.
PARIS: Rory, come on. We're sitting in a sea of expertise in this field. The college campus. There's no end of knock-headed bimbos with tons of dross to dispense. There's two now.
RORY: Paris, don't.
PARIS: Althea! Janet! Come here!
RORY: You hate Althea and Janet.
PARIS: Granted, they know nothing of Ukrainian politics or the periodic table, but when it comes to boys, they're brighter than the Brontes.
JANET: What, Paris?
RORY: Hey, Janet. Althea.
PARIS: Girls, we have related problems. A little love trouble.
RORY: We?
PARIS: Bend your ears?
ALTHEA: Uh, sure.
RORY: No, Althea, please. Go. Enjoy your Sunday. There's no love trouble here.
ALTHEA: I don't mind.
RORY: I do.
PARIS: Fine, then I'll just lay out my situation.
RORY: Great. Good. 'Cause I'm out of this.
[Janet and Althea sit down.]
PARIS: Okay, so I've got a guy.
JANET: Blind?
PARIS: Can it. Last time I saw him, he strongly implied that he was going to call me. And soon. It's been four days.
ALTHEA: You ever call him to hook up?
PARIS: He's always taken the reins.
ALTHEA: What did he say exactly?
JANET: Call you later, or see you later?
PARIS: Call. Or was it see?
JANET: Very different.
ALTHEA: Call's more descriptive. If he said 'call you later' and he didn't, it's an egregious 'screw you'.
PARIS: I'm pretty sure it was see.
JANET: Then I think you could cut him some slack. You like him, right?
PARIS: Yeah.
JANET: Then call him, but have a reason.
PARIS: We're on the paper together.
JANET: Perfect.
ALTHEA: Call to ask for notes or something. But don't give him anything else. If he's into you, he'll take it from there. If he's not, at least you know, so you can dump him.
PARIS: Direct, simple. A clear path. Thank you.
ALTHEA: You're welcome. [They start to get up.]
RORY: Um, excuse me.
JANET: Yeah?
RORY: If you don't mind, I'm wondering -
ALTHEA: Yeah?
RORY: Okay, I got close to kind of getting together with a guy -
ALTHEA: You mean like 'getting together', getting together?
RORY: Yeah. But, we were interrupted. Shouldn't he be calling me to talk, or maybe set up getting together?
ALTHEA: What was the interruption?
RORY: Mom. Then Dad. Then Mom's boyfriend.
ALTHEA: Whoa.
JANET: Poor guy.
ALTHEA: Okay, you definitely have to call him.
RORY: Really?
ALTHEA: He might be afraid to call.
JANET: Thinks you're too much drama.
RORY: Too much drama.
ALTHEA: You give him a call, but keep it casual.
PARIS: She's love dense. Give her specific language.
JANET: Get together?
ALTHEA: Or hang out?
JANET: That's better.
ALTHEA: Ask him to hang out sometime. It'll give him an easy out. If he says yes, meet up, act casual, but look hot.
PARIS: I've got a pen if you want to write this down.
RORY: No, I think I can remember. Thank you.
ALTHEA: No problem.
JANET: Anytime.
[They get up and leave.]
PARIS: Styrofoam for brains, but they know their stuff.
[Rory nods.]
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lorelai walks along. A chef at Antonioli's is putting a large pink bow on his door, and also is wearing a smaller one. He gives Lorelai a big 'thumbs up'. Gypsy approaches.]
GYPSY: I'm on your side, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Whoa, yo, Gypsy. What are you talking about?
GYPSY: The breakup.
LORELAI: What breakup?
GYPSY: Yours and Luke's.
LORELAI: We're not broken up.
GYPSY: Break up, split up, separated - whatever you want to call it.
LORELAI: I'd like to call it nothing. We're fine. What is with these ribbons?
GYPSY: Pink for you, blue for Luke. Taylor's idea. That way we all know whose side we're on without having to talk to each other. He's a freak, but I like pink.
LORELAI: Oh my God.
GYPSY: Look out, blue incoming. [She pulls her out of the way of a man walking by.]
LORELAI: Oh, Gypsy, please. Take that ribbon off. I don't want anyone encouraging Taylor on this.
GYPSY: Oh, it's way too late. He's passed out hundreds.
LORELAI: Hundreds?
GYPSY: It was no choice for me. Luke fixes his own truck, so I make bumpkins off him. But you, you don't know a piston from a pepperoni. Lots of money in ignorance. I'm with you.
LORELAI [Sees Luke going into Doose's market]: Okay, great. I'll catch up with you later. [She walks away.]
GYPSY: Pink power, baby. We chicks gotta stick together.
DOOSE'S MARKET
[Lorelai enters. Taylor is tying ribbons.]
TAYLOR: Lorelai.
LORELAI: I'll deal with you later. [She heads toward the back of the store.] Luke? Hi. I'm sorry to sneak up on you like this, but please, just give me a minute. We need to talk. I have so much to say. I should have told you about that night with Christopher. I know that now.
LUKE: Yeah, okay. I'm -
LORELAI: But I swear, the visit we had was so innocent. It was about his dad, and nothing happened. Less than nothing happened.
LUKE: But you hid it.
LORELAI: I know, and I shouldn't have. And I am so, so sorry. But all that talk from Christopher, at the wedding. I didn't see that coming. He was drunk. He was stupid. He's never not stupid, but I didn't see it coming.
LUKE: You should have.
LORELAI: I know. Rory warned me and I ignored her, but believe me. I am never seeing him again. Never.
LUKE: What are you talking about? He's Rory's father. He'll always be in your life.
LORELAI: In her life.
LUKE: Her life is your life.
LORELAI: Not when it comes to this.
LUKE: This is going to happen again and again.
LORELAI: No, it won't, Luke. I promise. God, if you care anything for me at all, just please trust me on this.
LUKE: I've got to go. [He pushes past her.]
LORELAI: Luke. No, wait. Wait. [She follows him to the door.] Luke, it was my mother, you know, who did all this. She was the one. She caused all this hateful stuff because Christopher is weak and she knows that and I am never talking to her again.
LUKE: They're always going to be in your life too.
LORELAI: No.
LUKE: Your mother, your father. The Gilmores will always be in your life.
LORELAI: I can cut them off.
LUKE: No, you just can't cut them off. It doesn't work that way, and they'll never feel differently about me, ever.
LORELAI: It doesn't matter, because they're gone. That's it. They are gone. I can do that.
LUKE: I can't have this out right now.
LORELAI: Okay, when? Where?
LUKE: I need more time! I told you that.
LORELAI: I'm afraid of this 'more time' stuff. I'm afraid it'll take forty years and that's not good.
LUKE: Lorelai.
LORELAI: We'll miss our middle. I want a middle. And the town is dividing us up. I need that to stop.
LUKE: Don't.
LORELAI: Luke. I am all in. I'm all in. Please trust me. Let me show you what a great girlfriend I can be. But I can't wait. We can't wait. I need to know what you're thinking right now.
LUKE: Fine. You want to know what I'm thinking right now? That I can't be in this relationship. It's too much.
[He leaves.]
LORELAI [stunned]: No.



YALE DORMS - RORY'S BEDROOM
[Rory dials a number on her cell phone.]
LOGAN: Hello?
RORY: Hi. It's Rory.
LOGAN: Rory Gilmore, as I live and breathe.
RORY: So, how are you?
LOGAN: I'm good, Ace, how are you?
RORY: I'm good.
LOGAN: Hope your life's been less exciting since the last time I saw you.
RORY: Relatively.
LOGAN: Meaning you're steering clear of country club dressing rooms?
RORY: Pretty much.
LOGAN: Good.
RORY: Yeah. So, I was wondering if maybe you -
LOGAN: Yeah?
RORY: If you'd like to hang out, or something.
LOGAN: Hang out?
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: When?
RORY: How about tonight?
LOGAN: Whoa, spontaneity.
RORY: I'm very 'of the moment' these days.
LOGAN: Well, sure, I'd love to hang out with you. Come on over.
RORY: To your place?
LOGAN: Absolutely.
RORY: Cool.
LOGAN: See you in a bit.
RORY: See you in a bit.
[She hangs up, proud of herself.]
YALE DORMS - A HALLWAY
[Rory knocks on a door. A stranger sticks his head out.]
GUY: Yeah.
RORY: Oh, hi. I don't think I'm in the right place.
LOGAN [calling from inside]: Hey, who is it?
GUY: Girl scout.
LOGAN: Hey, Ace. Come on in.
GUY: Come on in.
[She goes in. A poker table is set up in the middle of the room.]
LOGAN: Welcome to my night of humiliating defeat.
ROBERT: One in a series.
COLIN: Don't gloat, Robert. It's not Christian.
ROBERT: Neither am I.
LOGAN: Everybody, this is Rory.
ROBERT: Hi.
COLIN: Hey.
LOGAN: I'd introduce you, but I only know three of them.
COLIN: It's to you, buddy.
LOGAN: Oh, joy. Come on, kiddo, sit here next to me.
RORY: Is that allowed?
ROBERT: I wouldn't object.
LOGAN: Come on, be my good luck charm. Did I raise or check?
COLIN: You been eating out of aluminum pans again, buddy?
ROBERT: Your short term memory is non-existent.
LOGAN: Yeah, it's aluminum pans.
ROBERT: The more you stall, the slower I win.
COLIN: That was almost grammatically correct.
LOGAN: Two.
COLIN: Call.
LOGAN: Hold up. You look very nice tonight.
RORY: Oh, thanks.
LOGAN: What do you know about this game?
RORY: Um, just what I've seen on T.V. The Odd Couple.
LOGAN: What?
RORY: Quincy played it, but he wasn't called Quincy, um, Oscar and Felix. Felix didn't play it. Tony Randall, he cooked for them sometimes.
LOGAN: I am so lost.
RORY: I know a little.
LOGAN: Well, if you know anything, you know I need a jack or a ten.
[Robert lays down his hand.]
COLIN: Pocket jacks.
LOGAN: Un bloody believable.
ROBERT: Do we bother with fifth street?
LOGAN: Let's see it.
[The dealer lays down. The guys cry out in disbelief.]
LOGAN: Oh, now you're just mocking me!
ROBERT: Well, your gal brought someone some luck.
COLIN: Two g's. Ouch.
RORY: That was two thousand dollars?
COLIN: Got to bet it to win it.
LOGAN: It's just money.
ROBERT: He's down nine to me from last time. Should I send an I.O.U. to your Pop, that how you want to work it? Cut out the middle man?
LOGAN: Yeah, and I'll send some to your mother.
ROBERT: Generic, unfocused 'and-so's-your-mother' style comeback. You're off your game, Huntz.
LOGAN: I'll work on a better retort and get back to you.
ROBERT [to Rory]: So are you covering this?
RORY: Pardon me?
ROBERT: You were at the last Life and Death shindig, as I recall.
RORY: Yeah, but I'm not covering this. I'm just hanging out.
LOGAN: Yeah, back off, Robert. She's just hanging out.
[A girl brings Colin a drink.]
COLIN: Thanks, kid.
GIRL: Oh, you're welcome.
COLIN: I love the service here.
GUY: I'm out.
COLIN: Down to the tricks again.
ROBERT: I'm in.
LOGAN: Don't be a jerk, Robert.
ROBERT: What?
LOGAN: You bet without looking at your cards. Look at your cards.
ROBERT: I don't need to, with Rory here.
COLIN: I hate it when he does that.
LOGAN: You want a drink?
RORY: Me?
LOGAN: Yeah.
RORY: Well, actually I don't know how long I'm going to stay here so I think I'm good for now.
LOGAN: All right. Well, the way it's going tonight, I may not last till the next drink either. [He tosses some chips in.]
COLIN: Can we change the music?
GUY: No.
COLIN: Since when did you become Tipper Gore?
GUY: Shut up, Colin.
[Rory looks at the ground.]
DRAGONFLY INN
[A group of little girls are holding their dolls, looking bored and sad.]
SOOKIE: She's on her way, I know she is.
WOMAN: Well, I hope she is. Just hang in there, girls. I know you're hungry. [To Sookie] They're getting ready to rebel.
SOOKIE [dialing her cell phone]: It's just that Lorelai ordered all the tables and the little china and I'm sure it's here somewhere, it's just - excuse me for just a second. [She walks over to Michel] Please, help. You're just standing there. [She hangs up the phone and dials another number.]
MICHEL: I'm staying out of the way. In situations like this, 'do not get in the way' is so valuable.
SOOKIE: Well, get in the way. Entertain the kids.
MICHEL: Like I'm Sponge Boy Big Pants or something? I do not entertain children.
SOOKIE [hanging up again]: I'm getting worried. She left to do an errand yesterday and never came back.
MICHEL: Are you dialing the right number?
SOOKIE: I think after ten years I know Lorelai's number.
MICHEL: Well, where is she?
SOOKIE: I don't know. But she was in charge of everything except the pancakes, and without her all we have are pancakes! They're expecting games and stuff.
MICHEL: Oh, here's a fun game. Poke out all of the doll's eyes, mix them up, and match them to the right dolls.
SOOKIE: It's still voicemail!
MICHEL: Well, leave a message!
SOOKIE: I've left a million messages! I'm going to her house.
MICHEL: Don't leave me here!
SOOKIE: Stall, stall! [She leaves.]
LITTLE GIRL: My dolly fell. Kiss the boo-boo.
MICHEL: What part of the dolly is the boo-boo?
YALE DORMS - LOGAN'S COMMON ROOM - MORNING
[Rory is asleep on the couch. She wakes up to find the guys still playing poker.]
LOGAN: Come on, come on.
ROBERT: I've made my decision.
COLIN: I'm in. Three fifty.
ROBERT: Call.
LOGAN: I'm going to raise.
ROBERT: Ass.
COLIN: Our gentleman's courtesies still prevail, Rob.
ROBERT: Fine. Mr. Ass. Ass Esquire.
[They laugh]
COLIN: He's cracked! We've cracked Robert!
LOGAN: Mornin' there, Ace, how'd you sleep?
ROBERT: For the record you don't snore.
COLIN: We'd be happy to sign an affidavit to that effect for any prospective husband.
[Rory's cell phone rings. She digs in her purse and brings it out.]
RORY: Mom?
SOOKIE: It's me, Rory. It's Sookie.
RORY: Sookie? Are you at the house?
SOOKIE: Look, uh, something happened with your mom and Luke and your mom's in bad shape. I mean, she's down, hon. And I'm here now, but I think you oughta come. She needs you.
RORY: Oh my God. Is she hurt?
SOOKIE: No, not physically. Just come, okay?
RORY: I'm coming.
[She hangs up and gets ready to leave.]
LOGAN: I'm out. [He gets up.] You okay?
RORY: I have to go.
LOGAN: What happened?
RORY: I just have to go, I have to get home.
LOGAN: To your dorm?
RORY: Stars Hollow. Oh, no, I don't have my car.
LOGAN: Well, didn't you walk here, like a hundred yards away?
RORY: No, I mean I took it in for it's six month service. It's at the
dealer.
LOGAN: You take your car to the dealer? They so rip you off there!
RORY: Well it doesn't matter where it is! I don't have it! Which means that I have to take a bus or a train or something.
LOGAN: That'll take hours.
RORY: I know. I have to go.
LOGAN: Take my car.
RORY: I don't want to drive your car.
LOGAN: No, it's a car with a driver. I've got an account with the company.
RORY: No.
LOGAN: Take it. I'll give Frank a call, tell him to meet you out front. He'll take good care of you. It's a done deal.
RORY: Okay. Thanks.
LOGAN: Go!
[He dials a number. Rory leaves.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Sookie is sitting on the couch. Rory rushes in.]
RORY: Where is she?
SOOKIE: Upstairs.
RORY [heading upstairs]: Okay, I've got it from here, Sookie. I love you.
UPSTAIRS
[Lorelai is crying, lying in bed.]
RORY: Mom? What happened?
LORELAI: Luke.
RORY: What Luke?
LORELAI: He's gone! He hates me. I blew it. I blew everything.
RORY: I don't understand. What happened?
LORELAI: I should have told him about Christopher.
RORY: That was innocent.
LORELAI: But I should have told him. I hid it. I shouldn't have hid it.
RORY: Try to sit up.
LORELAI: She got to him.
RORY: To Dad? Who did?
LORELAI: Mom. She pushed him and it ruined everything. And now they're putting up ribbons.
RORY: Ribbons? Who?
LORELAI: Taylor, the town. They hate me. They all hate me. I wrecked everything.
RORY: Mom. This isn't good. Come on. Try to sit up.
LORELAI: He said he needed time to think, but I pushed him.
RORY: He'll come around.
LORELAI: I pushed him, and now he's gone.
RORY: He waited forever for you. He's not just going to walk away.
LORELAI: It's over.
RORY: Mom, this isn't you. Lying in bed like this. You should be up.
LORELAI: You should go to school. Go back to school.
RORY: I'm here. I'm staying.
LORELAI: God, I really screwed up this time.
RORY: Shh.
LORELAI: He could have been the one.
RORY: He'll come around. Shh. Try to sleep.
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai walks down the stairs.]
LORELAI: Rory?
[She looks into the kitchen and sees a video projector. She walks in and sees Luke sitting on Big Red.]
LORELAI: Luke?
[She walks into the Black, White and Read theater. She sits down next to Luke, smiling at him.]
LORELAI: Whatcha watching?
LUKE: Something stupid.
[The film shows Lorelai and Luke sitting in her kitchen drinking glasses of champagne, with candles all around.]
LORELAI: This isn't stupid.
FILM LUKE: Lorelai, this thing we're doing here, me, you. I just want you to know I'm in. I am all in.
[Film Lorelai says nothing.]
LORELAI: Say something.
[Luke on the couch next to her is replaced by a large blue ribbon.]
LORELAI: Say something!
[Lorelai wakes up in her bed. She rolls over and Rory is looking at her.]
RORY: You slept.
LORELAI: I guess.
RORY: Feeling better?
LORELAI: Sure.
RORY: No you're not.
LORELAI: You should get back to Yale.
RORY: Uh-uh.
LORELAI: Rory, you can't just stay here.
RORY: Sorry. I'm here for the duration.
LORELAI: No.
RORY: You need supplies.
LORELAI: I'm fine.
RORY: There's no sign that you've eaten or had anything to drink.
LORELAI: Well, I'm not hungry or thirsty.
RORY: Well, if you're staying up here you need supplies. Sustenance. Entertainment.
LORELAI: Well.
RORY: See, you're a little thirsty, aren't you.
LORELAI: A little.
RORY: What can I get you? Water? Bourbon?
LORELAI: Water is good.
RORY: What do you got food-wise?
LORELAI: Not much.
RORY: What's not much?
LORELAI: Like, nothing. Some moldy bread. I've been eating out mostly.
RORY: Okay, I'm going on a run.
LORELAI: I'm not hungry.
RORY: I'll get you some DVD's, too. Do you want magazines?
LORELAI: No.
RORY: I'll get you some magazines. You sure you don't want bourbon?
LORELAI: Honey, you have stuff to do.
RORY: This is my stuff. I'll be back in a flash.
LORELAI [gasps]: The ribbons.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Ah, the ribbons. They're all over town.
RORY: I'll just ignore them. Stupid Taylor!
LORELAI: People are going to be all over you with questions.
RORY: Then they'll feel the wrath of the Green Destiny.
LORELAI: Oh, you'll get b*mb.
RORY: Well, maybe I'll call in some reinforcements. [She kisses her head.] I've got my cell on.
LORELAI: 'Kay.
RORY: Don't go rollerblading or bowling or anything while I'm gone.
LORELAI: I won't.
[She watches Rory leave, then flops back into bed.]
DOOSE'S MARKET - OUTSIDE
[Lane walks out of the store followed by a bag boy. They are both carrying large bags.]
FRANK: I'll get those, Miss.
[Frank, the driver, put the bags in the trunk of the limo. Lane gets in.]
RORY: Did you get everything?
LANE: Everything on the list. Plus, I threw in a few things of my own. Some Toll House cookie dough. Cooked or uncooked, the ultimate comfort food.
RORY: Nice.
LANE: Chocolate covered matzah.
RORY: Nice and ethnic.
LANE: And a new toothbrush.
RORY: Why a new toothbrush?
LANE: Dentists say you're supposed to change your toothbrush every three months, and I'm assuming your mother's not doing that.
RORY: Well, I'm not sure how that's going to help her depression but you are a good friend. [She knocks on the divider at the front of the limo. The window opens and she hands Frank a sandwich.] You like ham and cheese, Frank?
FRANK: Ah, thank you, Miss.
RORY: We can head home now.
FRANK: Very good. [He closes the window.]
RORY: Was Taylor in there?
LANE: 'Fraid so. And he was holding court.
RORY: What?
LANE: He was talking with a bunch of people about the breakup. Big debate going on.
RORY: What debate?
LANE: Oh, about whether Elm should have gone more pink than blue, and whether Lorelai should have married that Max guy when she had the chance. Oh, and he was passing out ribbons like there was no tomorrow.
RORY: Was he. [Knocks on the divider.] Hold on, Frank.
FRANK: Yes, ma'am.
DOOSE'S MARKET - INSIDE
[Taylor is talking to a customer while bagging her groceries. Rory enters.]
TAYLOR: Luke I've known longer, because of the diner. Lorelai is much later, but she -
RORY: Where are they, Taylor?
TAYLOR: What?
RORY: Don't play dumb. The ribbons.
[Taylor shows her the box. She grabs it.]
RORY: Take piano lessons or something!
[She leaves.]
TAYLOR: She was so sweet when she was little. [Shaking his head.]
IN THE LIMO
[Rory gets in.]
RORY: Got 'em.
LANE: My compliments to your moxie!
RORY: Oh, I've got moxie coming out of my ears today. [They hear a car honking.]
LANE: They honking at us?
RORY: They better not be. Frank, are they honking at us?
FRANK: I believe so.
RORY: Oh, I am in no mood for this. We are depressed! [She stands up, her head out the sunroof of the limo.] We'll move when we move, so stop -
[Luke is honking at them. He stops, shocked.]
LUKE: Oh. Sorry.
RORY: I'm not usually in a limo. [She goes back in.]
LORELAI'S BEDROOM
[Rory has set up her purchases on a table next to the bed. Lorelai is sitting up, eating something out of a bowl. Rory enters.]
RORY: Heads up, man coming in.
LORELAI: Oh! The T.V.!
[Frank enters with the T.V.]
RORY: You won't come downstairs, I'm bringing downstairs up to you. On the table, Frank.
FRANK: Very good. [To Lorelai] Evening, Ma'am.
LORELAI: Evening.
RORY: That's Frank, my driver. So, I put all the things you will definitely need within easiest reach - water, basic foodstuffs - then, the things that you have to reach for or stand up for recede in order of frequency of use. It's not a science, but I did the best I could.
LORELAI: Well, I'm loving the cereal combo.
RORY: Five different kinds, three sweetened, with a mix of non-fat milk and half and half. It's a Paris recipe.
LORELAI: Thank her for me.
FRANK: All done here.
RORY: Excellent.
FRANK: Anything else I can get for you?
RORY: I don't think so. Thanks, Frank.
LORELAI: Yeah, thanks, Frank. [He leaves.] Wait, who's Frank?
RORY: Oh, well, I had to get out here, and my car is at the dealer for it's six month service. So my friend had a car and a driver standing by, so they let me borrow it and Frank, and, well, that explains Frank.
LORELAI: You take your car to the dealer?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: They're such a rip-off there.
RORY: It says in the book to take it to the dealer.
LORELAI: If it said in the book to drive off a cliff, would you drive off a cliff?
RORY: Yes I would.
LORELAI: And 'they' is a 'he'.
RORY: Who?
LORELAI: The 'they' with the limo.
RORY: Yes, he's a 'he'.
LORELAI: Thank Logan for me.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Look, you and Frank should go.
RORY: No!
LORELAI: Yale's going to get mad.
RORY: Yale's not going to get mad.
LORELAI: Rory, I'm glad you came, but look how fine I am. I'm surrounded by everything I could possibly need. I even have raw cookie dough, for God's sake.
RORY: That was Lane's idea.
LORELAI: A whole village has seen to my needs. Go. It's time. Look, I'm sitting up and everything.
RORY: And you're feeling better, I mean, for real this time?
LORELAI: I'm not a hundred percent, but I'm getting there. I swear.
RORY: The downstairs is all set too. I cleaned up. Vacuumed a little, spot dusted. Oh, and I've checked in with Sookie.
LORELAI: Oh, good.
RORY: The party for the little girls and their dolls? Michel apparently really came through and it was a big hit. He sang a medley from Annie.
LORELAI: Oh, the big g*n. Good. Now go!
RORY: Okay. But I am going to call a lot.
LORELAI: I'm good with that.
RORY: And I only have one class tomorrow, so I could stop by again in the afternoon.
LORELAI: Well, there'll be no need.
RORY: You can call me, too, you know.
LORELAI: I know, Mom.
RORY: Okay. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye, honey.
RORY: And I'm going to have Frank honk before we leave.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: I don't know, it just sounds fun.
LORELAI: Okay.
[Rory leaves. Lorelai turns on the T.V. and flips through some channels. She turns it off again. The limo honks outside. Lorelai sighs and slumps back down in bed.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE - LATER
[Lorelai is sitting up in bed, staring. She reaches for the phone, then stops herself. She grabs it and dials a number, sniffling.]
LORELAI: Hey, Luke, it's me. I know I'm not supposed to be calling, but I am not doing really great right now, and - [Pause] I was just wondering, if, do you remember in The Way we Were, how Katie and Hubbell broke up because his friends were joking and laughing, and the president had just died, and she yelled at them and he was mad and he was going out to Hollywood, and, I mean, which she hated, and he broke up with her and she was really upset. And she called him and asked him if he would come over and sit with her because he was her best friend and she needed her best friend, and he did. And they talked all night, and they went out to Hollywood, which was a disaster, but it was good at first. With the boat, and uh, putting the books away. I've seen this movie a lot, so if you don't remember the putting the books away scene, don't feel stupid or anything. I was just sitting here thinking about it, because I, um, I'm in my house, and I was just, uh [Her voice breaks] Could - please come over. I - please. Rea
[She hangs up suddenly, realization on her face.]
LORELAI: Oh, my God.
[She gets out of bed.]
LUKE'S DINER - OUTSIDE
[Lorelai runs down the street. The diner is dark. She grabs the key from on top of the door frame and opens the door.]
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Lorelai sneaks in, looking around to make sure Luke isn't there. She goes to the answering machine and steals the tape and leaves.]
YALE DORMS - LOGAN'S COMMON ROOM
[Logan heads to the door to answer a knock. Rory is standing there.]
LOGAN: Hey, Ace, how you doing?
RORY: Fine.
LOGAN: Come on in.
RORY: Um, Logan, wait. No, I can't stay, I'm just returning Frank.
LOGAN: Returning Frank?
RORY: And the limo. Thanks very much.
LOGAN: Everything okay back home?
RORY: Okay enough. It was good that I went. Thank you very much for your help.
LOGAN: You're very formal tonight.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: Just your tone. It's formal.
RORY: Well, that's how it is. And, I fed Frank a nice sandwich, so he's all good to go.
LOGAN: You know you ended up being extremely lucky for me, Ace.
RORY: Is that so?
LOGAN: I took Robert for everything he had, plus everything I owed him from last time. You should come to all these things.
RORY: Yeah, kiddo, maybe I should.
LOGAN: What?
RORY: Hey, did it ever occur to you when I called to ask you if you wanted to hang out that I meant that it should just be the two of us?
LOGAN: I actually wasn't sure, the whole thing was a little vague.
RORY: It wasn't vague.
LOGAN: No, hanging out's a little vague. It's not a specific boy-girl thing.
RORY: Well, I can tell you that I wasn't expecting to be Fanny Brice to your Nicky Arnstein.
LOGAN: But I already had this game going, and I couldn't just kick everybody out, so my choice is to say no and not see you at all or say yes and do it the way we did it.
RORY: Well, I wasn't expecting a group.
LOGAN: So, I should have said no, meaning I wouldn't see you at all? I wanted to see you.
RORY: Well, that's nice. I wanted to see you too. I just thought it would be a little more intimate.
LOGAN: Intimate?
RORY: You know what I mean.
LOGAN: So the only time we can see each other is to have sex?
RORY: No, Logan, that's not what I'm saying.
LOGAN: That's what I'm taking from this.
RORY: Well, don't take that. That's not what I'm saying.
LOGAN: So, we can see each other under all kinds of conditions. Alone, in a group.
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: Good. Last night happened to be a group thing.
RORY: Right.
LOGAN: So I don't see the problem.
RORY: Yeah. No, I guess there really wasn't a problem.
LOGAN: Glad we cleared that up.
RORY: Yeah, me too.
LOGAN [steps forward]: Now, I'm going out of town for a few days, but I was going to give you a call to set something up for when I get back, but you called me first.
RORY: Right.
LOGAN: I'm back next Saturday. It's the first night I'm back. Want to - I don't know, what are the kids saying these days? Hang out?
RORY: I'm never listening to the breakfast cereal girls again.
LOGAN: What?
RORY: Nothing. I'm free.
LOGAN: No group this time.
RORY: No group this time.
LOGAN: Good, so next Saturday. [They kiss.] Thanks for feeding Frank.
RORY: You're welcome.
LOGAN: And I promise not to call you kiddo again, I kinda picked up on that sarcasm from before.
RORY: There are just so many other things you could call me.
LOGAN: That's an opening. [She kisses him again.]
RORY: Bye.
LOGAN [Looking after her]: Bye, Ace.
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[She walks toward the porch. Luke comes out of the front door.]
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: Are you okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, I -
LUKE: Sure? I got here, there was no answer.
LORELAI [sighs]: You got my message.
LUKE: Yeah, I was home and I couldn't reach the phone, so I ran over here. I knocked, there was no answer, so I tried the loose window, but I fixed that last week, and then I realized I fixed all the stupid ways there were to get in your house, and I broke the back door lock and I ran inside and you weren't there.
LORELAI: Oh, my God.
LUKE: It's okay, I can fix it.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry, Luke. I will never do this to you ever again. I am absolutely humiliated. I was hurting, and I knew if I called you you'd come. I never should have done that.
LUKE: It's okay.
LORELAI: No, it's not okay. It's not okay. I am not that girl. I am not the one who cries and falls apart and calls her ex-boyfriend to come and save her. Thank you so much for coming, and for breaking my door. You're an amazing guy for doing that. [She hands him the tape.]
LUKE: What's that?
LORELAI: It's the tape from your answering machine.
LUKE: From my answering machine?
LORELAI: The last crazy thing you will ever have to endure from me, I promise. [Pause.] I just want you to know that I heard you when you said that you're out. I did. I'm going to respect that from now on.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: You should go. It's cold. I'll be fine.
[Luke looks like he wants to say more, but Lorelai goes inside. He leaves.]

YALE CAMPUS
[Lorelai is walking around. A student hands her a flier.]
LORELAI: Oh, sure. Thanks.
[She continues walking. Busy students are everywhere. She knocks on Rory's dorm room door. A male voice answers.]
VOICE: Come in.
[Lorelai opens the door and sees Doyle on the couch.]
LORELAI: Hi! Hello. I'm sorry, do I have the wrong room?
DOYLE: I wouldn't know.
PARIS [coming out of her room]: How delightful to have all of my towels used and then deposited in my hamper with my dry clothes to create a pungent musty combo. Hey, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Paris, good, I have the right room.
PARIS: This is Rory's mother.
LORELAI [leans over to shake Doyle's hand]: Hi. Lorelai.
DOYLE: I'm Doyle, Rory's editor.
PARIS: And my lover.
LORELAI: Okay, well, super.
DOYLE: I don't think lover is exactly the correct term, Paris.
PARIS: Really? What is the correct term, Doyle?
DOYLE: At a later time, Paris.
PARIS: Doyle and I haven't defined the social aspects of our relationship yet.
LORELAI: Ah.
PARIS: Although we're having sex three or four times a week, so apparently the sexual aspects of our relationship are crystal freaking clear.
DOYLE: Paris, I beg you.
LORELAI: Is Rory here? 'Cause I could wait outside, or -
PARIS: I'm making you uncomfortable.
DOYLE: Yes.
PARIS: Her. Not you.
LORELAI: No, I'm fine. You two should be alone.
PARIS: I'm so sorry. I shouldn't be talking about love, or sex, especially since you -
LORELAI: Since I -
PARIS: Don't have any.
LORELAI: Rory! Are you here?
RORY [OS]: Yeah, I'm just getting my coat!
LORELAI: Ah! Can I watch?
RORY [OS]: Oh, is Paris out there?
LORELAI: She sure is.
RORY [OS]: Come on in.
LORELAI: Nice meeting you, Doyle.
DOYLE: Nice to meet you, too.
[Lorelai enters Rory's room. Doyle and Paris look at each other.]
PARIS: Yes?
DOYLE: You look so hot when you find me annoying.
PARIS: Then I must be Gisele Bündchen to you 24/7.
RORY'S ROOM
[Rory is putting on lipstick. Lorelai waits near the door.]
RORY: Sorry, I thought she and Doyle were indisposed.
LORELAI: No, no, plenty of disposal going on. So I notice you told Paris about my breakup.
RORY: Ah. I'm sorry, I didn't tell her on purpose. It's very difficult to keep anything from Paris. It's very close proximity and I swear she has a dog's ears.
LORELAI: That's fine.
RORY: I didn't mean to blab.
LORELAI: I know. But, hey, don't worry about me. Things are starting to look up. [She holds up the flier she received outside.] They think I'm a student.
RORY [peering at the flier]: And they also think you're Polynesian and potentially sexually undecided.
LORELAI: Yeah. Well, still an improvement.
RORY: Okay. Ready.
LORELAI: This was a good idea, having dinner.
RORY: Well, it is Friday night.
LORELAI: Yeah, but Friday night dinner without Ava and Adolf. Lovely.
RORY [indignant]: It's really not fair calling Grandpa Adolf!
LORELAI: No, no, that was Grandma.
RORY: Oh.
[They enter the common room.]
RORY: We're going.
[Doyle is standing near the fridge eating out of a giant bag of chips.]
DOYLE: Rory, are these your chips?
RORY: Yes, Doyle.
DOYLE [crunching]: Can I have some?
RORY: Knock yourself out, Doyle.
PARIS: Listen, Lorelai? If you decide that your breakup is something that you want to talk about, please let me know.
LORELAI: Okay, Paris.
PARIS: And let me know before Tuesday, because I'm doing a paper for my Emotional Mental Health class about how women of a certain age cope with loneliness, and I think you'd be a great lead-off antidote.
[Lorelai, stunned, looks at Rory meaningfully.]
RORY: You can't take her. She's trained in Krav Maga.
LORELAI: Damn it.
[They leave.]
OPENING CREDITS
YALE CAFETERIA
[Lorelai and Rory are carrying trays of food, looking for a place to sit down.]
LORELAI: Okay, so where do the cool kids sit?
RORY: This is Yale. There are no cool tables.
LORELAI: Oh, come on. Point out the cliques. The geeks. The stoners. The Plastics. Give me the scoop.
RORY: The scoop is that this is Yale. There are no cliques, we are beyond cliques.
LORELAI: So you get to college, and everybody just loves each other?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: It's Haight Ashbury all over again.
RORY: Except the tie-dye is done by Prada.
LORELAI: Okay. [She starts to sit down at a table.]
RORY: Hey, not that one.
LORELAI: See, that was the clique table.
RORY: No, it's under an air vent. [They sit at the next table.]
LORELAI: Seriously, Grandma, buy a shawl.
RORY: Hey, one good cold can set you back a month in studying.
LORELAI: Mmm. See, in my mind, I heard 'partying', but okay.
RORY [Raising her glass]: Here's to our very own special Friday night dinner.
LORELAI: Hear, hear. [They clink their glasses.] This stuff looks pretty good.
RORY: It is. So what's going on at home?
LORELAI [gasps dramatically]: Big grapefruit shortage. The hurricanes wiped them out and Taylor is completely freaking out.
RORY: I'm sure.
LORELAI: And Patty and Babette are organizing Stars Hollow's first botox party.
RORY: Are you invited?
LORELAI: Are you insinuating I should be?
RORY: So the Hollow's low on grapefruits.
LORELAI: Uh-huh. And I'm doing costumes for the Stars Hollow Elementary School production of Fiddler on the Roof.
RORY [meaningfully]: So, how are you doing?
LORELAI: I'm doing fine.
RORY: How are you doing?
LORELAI: I'm doing fine. I swear. I'm getting better.
RORY: No word from Luke?
LORELAI [sighing]: Not waiting on word from Luke.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Anyhow, I'm fine. I mean, not that I'm over it, but little by little it's getting easier to pretend it's easier, which means easier must be right around the corner.
RORY: I'm sure it is.
LORELAI: And I'm working on getting down a new routine. I've settled on Weston's in the morning.
RORY: Decent coffee, excellent strudel.
LORELAI: Yeah. So, that's me. How are you?
RORY: Hmm, well, I study, then study, then after a little study break, I study.
LORELAI: Uh-huh. How's, um, Logan?
RORY: He's been out of town for a while so I haven't seen him.
LORELAI: Hmm. And what else?
RORY: Mm. [Avoiding eye contact]
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I got an e-mail from Dad.
LORELAI [surprised]: Oh, you did? Huh. When?
RORY: Monday.
LORELAI: Only two weeks after the fact. Very speedy.
RORY: I'm sure he was just nervous.
LORELAI: You know, you don't need to hide that from me.
RORY: Well, I wasn't sure if you wanted to hear about it, or hear Dad's name -
LORELAI: Hey, it's part of the whole 'moving on' thing, right? So what did he say?
RORY: He wanted to give me his side of the story.
LORELAI: Oh, well. Unless his side of the story includes having his long-lost evil twin lock him in the closet and come to the wedding in his place, his side of the story doesn't exist.
RORY: He said it was all a misunderstanding.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: He said the only reason he came was to celebrate Grandma and Grandpa's vow renewal.
LORELAI: And 'cause Adolf told him to.
RORY: He says he likes Luke.
LORELAI: Yeah, he's proven that.
RORY: He just wants you to be happy.
LORELAI: So, he got me dumped.
RORY: And, basically that the whole thing was just a misunderstanding.
LORELAI: You know, the more he defends himself, the more he needs to defend himself.
RORY: Hey, do you think Grandpa knew about it?
LORELAI: About Christopher coming?
RORY: Do you think he planned it with Grandma?
LORELAI: Look how panicked you are. No, honey, honestly, the whole thing reeks of Emily. I mean, not that I think he would have discouraged it, but I'm pretty sure she's the one who poisoned the apple and gave it to Dopey to bring to the party.
RORY: Yeah.
[Two girls sit down at their table. They look weak and shaken, and are holding their heads.]
GIRL #1: Oh my God.
GIRL #2: Never again.
GIRL #1: Never, never again.
LORELAI [quiet, to Rory]: See, we are at the cool table. [Rory looks at her.] I'm telling you, if she throws up you're golden.
YALE COURTYARD
[Lorelai and Rory are walking, eating ice cream.]
LORELAI: You are so not starving here at Yale.
RORY: My lips are frozen.
LORELAI: Look, while it might seem a little eccentric to eat ice cream in forty degree weather -
RORY: You'd think!
LORELAI: There are several advantages to the concept. For example, since it's cold out, the ice cream won't melt, therefore it'll last longer.
RORY: So then my lips will stay frozen for double the amount of time.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Okay, I lost the feeling in my tongue!
RORY: I'm throwing the ice cream out now.
LORELAI: Oh, my God, it's frozen. It's like an ice cube. A tongue-shaped ice cube and it'll never thaw.
RORY: Then why don't you shut your mouth? Let the heat stay inside?
LORELAI: That was hostile. [Pause.] And useful. Thank you. [Points across the quad.] Hey, isn't that your naked guy?
RORY: Oh, yeah. Marty, hey! He's not my naked guy.
[Marty sees Rory, and as her attention is turned to Lorelai he runs in the other direction.]
LORELAI: Well, you don't really want a communal naked guy, nowadays, you know, it's too sketchy. [They look over. Marty is gone.] Huh. Well, I guess he didn't hear about you sitting at the cool table.
RORY [distracted]: Yeah.
LORELAI: You guys rumbling?
RORY: No, we're just not as close lately.
LORELAI: Aw, that's too bad. He seems like a nice guy.
RORY: Yeah, he is.
LORELAI: All right, honey. Thank you for dinner.
RORY: You're leaving?
LORELAI: Yeah, I should get back.
RORY: Okay. You can come in and watch T.V. for a while if you want.
LORELAI: It's okay.
RORY: You can even stay over if you don't feel like driving back.
LORELAI: Are there monsters under your bed again?
RORY: I'm just saying.
LORELAI: Look, Miss Nightingale. I appreciate your concern. And the offer to spend the night is much nicer than the suggestion that I shut my mouth, but I'm fine.
RORY: You sure?
LORELAI: Big girl.
RORY: Yeah. It's still new.
LORELAI: Angel, I have been dumped before.
RORY: Not by Luke.
LORELAI: No, not by Luke. But a dump is a dump. The process is still the same. Don't worry, Mom's cool.
RORY: I know Mom's cool.
LORELAI: 'Cause you heard about the table?
RORY: Exactly.
LORELAI: All right, kid, I'll see you later.
RORY: Okay, bye. [They kiss on the cheek and Lorelai goes.]
WESTON BAKERY
[A couple carries their order toward the door.]
LORELAI: Wow, looks good. Hey, I'm Lorelai, I'll be here every morning.
[They leave.] ‘Kay, see you guys tomorrow.
WOMAN: Here we go. Three coffees.
LORELAI: Oh, no, I'm sorry. I only ordered one.
WOMAN: You said "Coffee, coffee, coffee".
LORELAI: Haha, no, see, I said "coffee-coffee-coffee".
WOMAN: Right.
LORELAI: As in I really need coffee-coffee-coffee. You know.
WOMAN: No.
LORELAI: Coffee-coffee-coffee is a saying, like an exaggeration. It's a funny, desperate cry for caffeine. It's just my thing. ‘Cause everybody knows I drink a lot of coffee, so the day can't start until I've had my jolt. It's a bit. My bit. [The woman stares blankly at her.] It's not a particularly funny bit unless you know me, then – you know what, three coffees would be great. What do I owe you?
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lorelai is driving her Jeep. She drives past Luke's and sees his boat parked out front. She looks hurt. She keeps driving.]
YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE
[Doyle is leading a staff meeting.]
DOYLE [upset]: I don't know what other words I should use. Perhaps I should talk slower, or have a woman sit in a circle above my head signing my words to you.
GLENN: That would be fresher than you yelling at us.
DOYLE: Glenn.
GLENN: Sorry. But every time I hear you I hear my mother. See my mother -
DOYLE: Stop comparing me to your mother.
GLENN: Stop acting like her.
DOYLE: Anyhow, as I was saying –
GLENN: Pick up your socks!
PARIS: Hey! Our editor's talking!
GLENN: He's your boyfriend, not mine.
PARIS: That has yet to be determined.
RORY [To Glenn]: You're particularly sassy today.
GLENN: I know. It must be my new glasses prescription.
DOYLE: I need all of you to hand in a hard copy of your stories in addition to filing them electronically. Last week our mail server was down and we very nearly missed our deadline. Now how would that have looked?
GLENN: Blank.
DOYLE: Glenn!
GLENN: Sorry. Mom. [He and Rory snicker.]
DOYLE: New system starts today. [Rory sees Marty through the window and gets up to go talk to him.] I want all articles in hard copy on my desk – where are you going?
RORY: I'll be right back.
DOYLE: I'm talking!
RORY: And very well, might I add.
DOYLE: Gilmore!
RORY: Doyle, I could be back by now!
YALE CAMPUS – OUTSIDE THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE
[Marty is buying a coffee. Rory comes outside.]
RORY: Now that's a manly sized cup of coffee.
MARTY: Uh, yeah. I, uh, I worked late, and I had a paper and I didn't get a lot of sleep –
RORY: Marty, you never have to apologize for a huge cup of coffee to me.
MARTY: Right. I know. [He turns and starts walking away. Rory stays with him.]
RORY: So you've been pretty busy lately, huh?
MARTY: Uh, yes.
RORY: Working a lot?
MARTY: Yes.
RORY: Studying a lot?
MARTY: Yes.
RORY: So that's probably why I haven't seen you very much.
MARTY: Yes. Probably.
RORY: I missed you. A lot.
MARTY: Well, I'm sure you've been a little busy yourself.
RORY: I guess. Hey listen, are you working this weekend?
MARTY: Uh, no.
RORY: Great, because I was thinking. It's been ages since we've had a good hangout night.
MARTY: Oh, well –
RORY: We could watch DVD's, order food. Oh, I just got the new Marx Brothers box set. You love the Marx Brothers, Duck Soup!
MARTY: I don't know if I can –
RORY: Did you hear me? I just said Duck Soup.
MARTY: Rory –
RORY: We could watch them all. You know, start early. Make a major marathon thing out of it. Just us. We haven't done this in a long time. Please?
MARTY: Okay. Sounds good.
RORY: Really? Oh, great! [She gives him a hug.] Okay, so on Saturday? Three-ish?
MARTY: Three-ish it is.
RORY: Excellent. Really. Okay, I have to get back, and you have a lot of coffee to drink. So I'll see you Saturday.
MARTY: See you Saturday.
RORY [heading back inside]: Okay!
[Marty smiles and keeps walking.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke serves Andrew his meal.]
ANDREW: Hey Luke, great boat you got out there.
LUKE: Oh, yeah. Thanks.
ANDREW: Are you selling it, or [he covers one eye with his hand and talks in a pirate voice] is it some kind of seafood promotion?
LUKE: I don't want to talk about it!
ANDREW [mumbling]: Good thing you parked it right outside the diner, then.
LUKE: What?
ANDREW [coughs]: Nothing. Nothing.
[Lulu enters with a little boy. Luke is wiping a table.]
LULU: Go on. He's right over there.
[The boy stands very near to Luke but says nothing. Luke finishes wiping the table and suddenly notices him.]
LUKE: Geez, kid! Don't just stand there, you'll give me a heart attack.
[He takes a plate behind the counter, and when he turns around, the boy is standing at the counter looking at him.]
LUKE: Hey.
BRADLEY: Mr. Danes.
LUKE: Yeah, speak up, there, kid. We've got a bit of a height difference here.
BRADLEY: I need to ask you something.
LUKE: Bathrooms are in the back. They're for customers only, so you have to order something. You want to order something? [Bradley shakes his head.] You want to use the bathroom? [Bradley shakes his head again.] Well then what do you want? [Bradley starts sucking on his inhaler.] What are you doing? What's he doing?
LULU: Don't worry. This always happens when he's terrified.
LUKE: What the hell is he terrified of?
LULU: Bradley, would you like me to tell him for you? [Bradley nods.] Okay. Luke.
LUKE: Why's he doing that?
LULU: Oh, he's fine.
LUKE: He doesn't look fine.
LULU: Luke. Luke! [She snaps her fingers] Eyes on me! Eyes on me. Thank you. Now, as you know, I teach third grade over at the elementary school. And our production of Fiddler on the Roof is on Saturday. And Bradley here is in charge of set design. Right, Bradley? [Bradley nods.] So, he just wanted to come here and tell you that he will need you at the school tomorrow at three o'clock. And please bring your own tools. Okay? You did that very well, Bradley!
LUKE: What are you talking about?
LULU: I thought Bradley was very clear.
LUKE: What do you mean, he needs me at the school tomorrow? He needs me at the school to do what?
LULU: To help build the sets.
LUKE: I'm not going to help build any sets.
LULU: But –
LUKE: I have a diner to run. I don't have time to build any sets.
LULU: But Lorelai signed you up weeks ago.
LUKE: She did?
LULU: Yes, she did. She signed you up to build the sets and she signed herself up to make the costumes.
LUKE: Oh, I must have forgot about that.
LULU: Yeah. I know you two are having a little trouble, I mean, I saw the boat. But I figured since it was for the kids you'd still be willing to help.
LUKE: Lorelai's still making the costumes?
LULU: Oh, of course she is. A lot of the parents are helping out, with costumes, make-up, lighting, programs –
LUKE: But you've spoken to her recently, and she's going to be there, making the costumes?
LULU: Look, Luke. If it's going to be too hard for you to be in the same space as Lorelai, I totally –
LUKE: No, it's fine. I'll be there.
LULU: You sure?
LUKE: Yeah, I mean, if other people are going to be helping out, I might as well, you know. It's for the kids – I'll see you tomorrow at three, right?
BRADLEY: With your tools.
LUKE: With my tools.
LULU: That's great. Thank you, Luke. The kids'll be thrilled.
LUKE: Well, that's what matters, right?
LULU: Let's go, Bradley.
BRADLEY: I hope he's not late.
LULU: Oh, I hope so too.
[They exit.]
DRAGONFLY INN – KITCHEN
[Lorelai enters, carrying a large bag. Sookie is sitting at the table.]
SOOKIE: No more pork!
LORELAI: Finally, something to put on our business card.
SOOKIE: I'm tired of it. I am out of interesting ways to serve it and I'm not buying it anymore.
LORELAI: Hmm.
SOOKIE: I want another other white meat.
LORELAI: Mugsy raised the price on you again, huh?
SOOKIE: That pig-hoarding bastard.
LORELAI: Well, cut it out for a month. I bet he comes around.
SOOKIE: I guess. Ooo, what's in the bag? [Lorelai opens the bag and displays its contents.] And that is –
LORELAI: A bag of Santa beards.
SOOKIE: Naturally.
LORELAI: I need twenty-five dark beards for Fiddler on the Roof. I drove to four different towns and six different costume shops and this is all I could find. Apparently Lieberman's the only Jew in Connecticut. [Sookie giggles] Hey, can I borrow some tea?
SOOKIE: Why?
LORELAI: I thought I'd use it to dye them.
SOOKIE: Oh, very clever. Up on the shelf.
LORELAI: Thanks.
SOOKIE: So, other than the great beard search, how was your morning?
LORELAI: Fine.
SOOKIE: Yeah? Good! So, what route did you take to work today?
LORELAI: Oh, the usual. You know, Main Street to Oak and then a sharp starboard turn at the marina and four nautical miles to the Inn.
SOOKIE: You saw it.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah.
SOOKIE: Rats.
LORELAI: I saw the back of the boat driving from Weston's, I saw the front of the boat from the bank and then I went upstairs to the post office and I got a nice aerial sh*t of the boat. Basically I took the White House tour of the boat.
SOOKIE: I can't believe Luke did this. I mean, what was he thinking?
LORELAI: I don't know.
SOOKIE: When did he come get it?
LORELAI: b*at me. I didn't notice it gone when I left this morning, so –
SOOKIE: Did he tell you he was going to take it?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Well, I think that stinks. He's a jerk for pulling something like that.
LORELAI: It's his boat. He can do what he wants with it.
SOOKIE: Not if it's something mean. He can't.
LORELAI: Well, I caused the situation in the first place. I bought the boat. I put it in my garage.
SOOKIE: I know, but he broke your heart and now he's rubbing your face in it.
LORELAI: Geez, I sound pathetic.
SOOKIE: I know!
LORELAI: Look, Sookie, please. You don't have to be mad at Luke. Okay? You don't have to hate him.
SOOKIE: Oh, I don't mind hating him.
LORELAI: I appreciate that, but I don't really want to talk about it anymore. [She picks up the bag of beards.]
SOOKIE: Where are you going? Did I drive you out? I'm sorry! I'll stop talking about it.
LORELAI: No, it's fine. I'm fine, I just have stuff to do. I have costumes to make and beards to convert, so I'll see you later.
SOOKIE: Okay.
[Lorelai leaves.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – NIGHT
[She pulls the Jeep into the driveway. She walks over to the empty garage. She shakes her head and heads into the house.]
STARS HOLLOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
[Lulu is talking to two boys on the stage. Luke walks uncertainly around the curtain.]
LULU: Hey, Luke! We are so glad you to see you.
BRADLEY: You're ten minutes late.
LUKE: Yeah, uh, sorry about that. Hey, I brought my tools.
LULU: Great. Well, this is Damon.
LUKE: Hey there Damon.
DAMON: My mother's a lesbian.
LUKE: Oh. [Pause] I brought my tools.
LULU: And you remember your supervisor, Bradley.
LUKE: Yeah, Bradley. Nice to see you again, Bradley.
LULU: Well, you boys should get started. I'll be right over here if you need my help. Have fun!
LUKE: So, where do we get started, men?
BRADLEY: First we have to build Tevye's house.
LUKE: Okay, we can do that.
BRADLEY: There's plans for the house over here.
LUKE: Uh, yeah. Show me the plans.
[Bradley runs off to get the plans.]
DAMON: Do you know any lesbians?
LUKE: Uh, uh, sure, I do.
DAMON: How many?
LUKE: Three, maybe four.
DAMON: Maybe four?
LUKE: Well, waiting on confirmation.
DAMON: I like lesbians.
LUKE: Yeah, they're, they're swell.
BRADLEY: Here are the plans.
LUKE: Okay, let's see what we got. [Luke looks at the plans.] All right. Looks pretty simple. Looks like the boards are already cut. Okay, let's get started. Uh, everyone grab a Philips-head screwdriver. [The boys dig around in a box.] Okay, once you have your screwdriver – what are you holding? Bradley, that's a hammer.
BRADLEY: It is?
LUKE: Damon, that's tape.
DAMON: Oh.
LUKE: I can't believe this. No one ever taught you what a Philips-head screwdriver is?
DAMON: My mother's a lesbian.
LUKE: Uh-huh, okay. Come here. See, this is a Philips-head screwdriver. And this is a flathead screwdriver. See, ‘cause it's got a –
DAMON and BRADLEY: Flat head!
LUKE: Yes, exactly. Now, we need a Philips-head screwdriver, so go ahead and find that, and we'll get started. Okay? Hurry up, we get done by five, beers are on me.
[Damon and Bradley go back to digging through the box. A woman enters the backstage area.]
CARRIE: Well, well, well, look who Santa stuffed in my stocking.
LUKE: Yeah, Carrie. What a surprise.
CARRIE: Isn't life a scream? My God, you look fantastic. Breakups agree with Luke Danes. Give me a hug. [She throws herself on him, he looks
uncomfortable.]
LUKE: Yeah, easy there, kids are here.
CARRIE [breathy]: So, how are you? I heard all about it. I tell you, that Lorelai is out of her mind. I mean, that's apparent from the outfits alone, but to let one of the last real He-Men go free, she should up that dosage, baby.
LUKE: Carrie, what are you doing here?
CARRIE: Oh, I'm the director, isn't that fabulous? Jenny got me into it.
LUKE: Jenny is your –
CARRIE: My youngest, she's seven. [Hushed] God help her, the spitting image of her father.
LUKE: Yeah, where is she?
CARRIE: Oh, she's hiding under a chair somewhere. She's so odd, that girl. She's always hiding from me.
LUKE: Yeah, crazy. Anyway, I gotta build Tevye's house, here.
CARRIE: Oh, I have to get rehearsals started anyway. It's good to see you Luke, we'll have to catch up later.
LUKE: Yeah, sure, we sure will, Carr. [She goes out onto the stage. Bradley and Damon rejoin Luke.] Don't you ever leave me alone with her again! [They nod.]
CARRIE: Okay, kids. I need my cast right here in the middle of the stage.
Everybody, let's gather right here.
KIRK: Hey, Luke. You're helping out here?
LUKE: Oh, yeah. Sets. How about you?
KIRK: I'm playing Tevye.
LUKE: You're –
CARRIE: Come on, kids. Chop, chop.
KIRK: Excuse me, my director's calling.
CARRIE: Okay, now, before we start rehearsal, I just want to ask, has anybody seen Jenny?
[They all shake their heads.]
CARRIE: Okay, never mind. Now, I need to remind you that I need to know whose mommies and daddies are going to be coming to the show. [Damon waves his hand.] Yes, Damon, I know your mommy's a lesbian, but is she coming to the show? [Damon nods.] Okay, great. And everyone else, I need to know so I can issue your tickets. [Kirk puts up his hand.] Yes, Kirk.
KIRK: My mother's going to be in Florida.
CARRIE: Okay, fine. Everybody else, tell me or Miss Kuschner by the end of the day. Now before we start, does anybody have to go potty? [Several kids, and Kirk, put up their hands.] Well, go now and go fast, we have a lot of work to do.
KIRK: I'll just be two minutes and then it's L'Chaim to Life.
[The kids, and Kirk, run off.]
LUKE: Hey, Lulu?
LULU: Yes?
LUKE: I was just wondering, where are all the other tall people?
LULU: Excuse me?
LUKE: You know, other people to help out with the lighting, the makeup, the costumes.
LULU: Oh, they'll be here. They all come in at different times.
LUKE: Okay, I was just asking. No biggie.
[Kirk and the kids come running back from the bathrooms.]
KIRK: I'm here! I'm done, I flushed.
CARRIE: Good boy, Kirk! Okay, everyone take your places for the top of the show!
LUKE [To Lulu]: What is Kirk doing in the play?
LULU: Oh, we couldn't find a boy who could handle the part.
LUKE: But it's an elementary school play. How hard could the part be?
LULU: Tevye is a very demanding role.
LUKE: But –
LULU: We looked and looked. We even opened up auditions to the scary extension school kids, but nothing. And you know, we had a terrible experience last year when we did Jesus Christ Superstar.
LUKE: Oh, yeah.
LULU: Jesus was allergic to peanuts and stuffed one up his nose and broke out in terrible hives during intermission. The second act was all Judas and Pontius Pilate – pure disaster. We had to refund money, it was a nightmare. So this year, we went with a ringer. [She looks lovingly at Kirk, who has started rehearsing.]
KIRK: A fiddler on the roof? Sounds crazy, no?
LUKE: Oh, boy, does it.
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Sookie gets out of her car.]
SOOKIE: I got ‘em! I'm here!
LORELAI [from the garage]: Oh, great. Get in here.
SOOKIE: I got all the glue and glitter they had.
LORELAI [reading a design magazine]: Perfect.
SOOKIE: So, what are you thinking here?
LORELAI: I don't know. Something colorful, or something peaceful. You know, it could be a Zen sort of space, or a yoga studio. Drew Barrymore has one.
SOOKIE: Oh, and she looks very calm.
LORELAI: Yeah. I just want it to be a special all-me alone place. Here, look in this for ideas.
SOOKIE: Ooo, classic Hollywood homes.
LORELAI: Oh, and look what I found.
SOOKIE: A disco ball! Where'd you find a disco ball?
LORELAI: In my closet.
SOOKIE: Wow. [Her cell phone rings.]
LORELAI: I should have done this years ago.
SOOKIE [answering her phone]: Hello?



[The scene cuts between Lorelai's garage and the front desk at the Dragonfly, where Michel is cleaning his pants with a lint roller.]
MICHEL: I heard a noise in the kitchen.
SOOKIE: What kind of noise?
MICHEL: A ‘bam', or a ‘clang'. Possibly a ‘crash'. It might have a ‘wham' or a ‘kapow'.
SOOKIE: Well, did you go check it out?
MICHEL [Running the lint roller over the top of the computer monitor]: Excuse me, I'm extremely busy. Someone here has to work, I mean, the two of you just run off to do your little decorating project and you leave me here alone.
SOOKIE: Michel! Did you actually hear a noise?
MICHEL: Of course I heard a noise. It was a ‘thwap' or a ‘vroom'.
SOOKIE: Gotta go, Michel. [She hangs up.] Oy.
LORELAI: What's a matter?
SOOKIE: Apparently Batman's attacking the inn.
LORELAI: Hmm. [She holds up a shimmering gold fabric.] Hey, Moulin Rouge, what do you think? Jeweled elephant in one corner, Ewan McGregor in the other.
SOOKIE: Ooo, sounds yummy. [Her phone rings again. She answers it.] What, Michel?
MICHEL: I'm smelling something very funny coming from the kitchen. Could be a pungent cheese, could be arson. Should I call the firemen to come, or should I just fetch some crackers?
[Lorelai and Sookie roll their eyes at each other.]
YALE DORMS – RORY'S COMMON ROOM
[Rory is setting up bowls on the table. Doyle enters.]
DOYLE: Ah, Rory. Good. I'm glad you're here. I wanted to talk to you about something. [He tosses his keys and jacket on the chair.] I think we need to discuss the incident at the Daily News the other day. [He grabs a soda out of the fridge.]
RORY: What incident, Doyle?
DOYLE: We were in the middle of a meeting. I, your editor, was talking, and suddenly, without warning, you flew out of the room.
RORY: I was gone for five minutes, Doyle.
DOYLE: Yes, but the very fact that you felt comfortable enough to leave signals a big problem.
RORY: I had to talk to a friend.
[Doyle sits down on the couch and takes off his shoes.]
DOYLE: This is a matter of respect, Rory. Respect for the paper, respect for me. Frankly, respect for yourself. [He takes off his sock.]
RORY: Doyle –
DOYLE: I have a pebble in my shoe. Damn thing's been driving me crazy all day long. [He pulls the pebble from the sock and places it on the table. Rory looks disgusted.] Anyhow, where was I?
RORY: My lack of respect for you.
DOYLE: Yes, good, thank you. You have to remember that this is college. You're dealing with real life here. You have to start developing boundaries between your work and your personal life.
RORY: Doyle!
DOYLE: What?
RORY: Your sock is on my coffee table!
DOYLE: Just for a second.
RORY: You want to talk about boundaries? You are here every day. You eat my food. You drink my soda. You have a key and you don't even live here.
DOYLE: Paris said ‘mi casa su casa'.
RORY: Great. Well, Paris' casa is right in there, so go in or get lost, because I have company coming, and I don't want the first thing he sees when he walks in to be your feet or your face.
DOYLE: But – but I'm your editor.
RORY: Out! And take your pebble with you!
DOYLE [grumbling while collecting his things]: Bet Woodward and Bernstein never tossed Ben Bradley out of their room.
RORY: Ben Bradley kept his shoes on! [She slams the door.]
LORELAI'S GARAGE
[Michel is up on a ladder, painting. Lorelai and Sookie are sitting and watching.]
MICHEL: I don't know if anyone's noticed, but suddenly I am the only one working.
SOOKIE: You're right, no one noticed.
MICHEL: My arm is cramping up.
LORELAI: We offered to take over, Michel.
MICHEL: These stencils are antiques. They've been handed down from generation to generation of Girards. No one touches these stencils but me.
SOOKIE: Okay.
MICHEL: The fumes are making me sick.
LORELAI: Oh, my God, you had a fit to be included, and you've done nothing but complain since you got here.
MICHEL: I did not have a fit to be included. I have a life. I have plenty of friends. And I dare you to find anyone who has a larger collection of techno and world music than I do. Feel that I need nothing from either one of you.
LORELAI [To Sookie]: Poor Michel.
MICHEL: No, do not ‘poor Michel' me. No.
SOOKIE: Well, I have to say, for only a few hours' work, this place looks pretty snazzy.
MICHEL [climbs down from the ladder]: Ah, I have finished with this wall.
SOOKIE: Super, three more to go.
MICHEL: Well, yes. Sometimes doing one wall makes it the focal point, the place of interest.
LORELAI: All four walls, Michel.
MICHEL: You tricked me into this.
LORELAI: Just like Tom Sawyer.
SOOKIE: So, what do you think? Is it turning into exactly what you had in mind? Your special, all-you, alone place?
LORELAI [sadly]: Yeah. It sure is.
YALE DORMS – HALLWAY
[Marty, carrying trays of hors d'oeuvres, knocks on Rory's door. She opens the door wearing a white curly wig and a top hat.]
RORY: What's up, Doc?
MARTY: What's up Doc?
RORY: Well, Harpo doesn't talk, so there's no catch phrase.
MARTY: Well, then, do Groucho.
RORY: Everybody does Groucho. Come in!
MARTY [looking around] I like what you've done with the place.
[Rory has set up Marx brothers posters on easels around the common room.]
RORY: Well, it's all about the vibe. What'd you bring?
MARTY: Just some leftovers from the Cartina engagement party.
RORY: I told you I would take car of the food.
MARTY: And I see you did.
RORY: Pretzels of the world. San Francisco sourdough, German pumpernickel, chocolate covered Swiss, and the wasabi bites are very intriguing. I also ordered a pizza before you got here.
MARTY: Okay, well, at least we got the food part covered.
RORY: Yes, we do. Sit, sit, sit.
[They sit. There is an awkward silence for a moment.]
MARTY: You going to stay like that all night?
RORY: Oh, no. Sorry. [She takes off the wig and hat.]
MARTY: I mean, you can.
RORY: No, it's okay.
MARTY: I mean, it works for you.
RORY: No, I'm good. [Another awkward pause.] I guess we should start the movie.
MARTY: Okay.
[She turns it on. They sit uncomfortably watching the movie.]
RORY: Wasabi nugget?
MARTY: Thanks. [He grabs a handful, without looking, and shoves them in his mouth. A horrified look crosses his face.]
RORY [concerned]: You in a little bit of pain there?
MARTY [mouth full]: Uh-huh. Much, much more than a little!
RORY: Well, don't worry! Your mouth will get numb in about a minute.
MARTY [mouth full]: I'm really looking forward to that.
RORY: How about a soda?
MARTY [mouth full]: That would be terrific, thanks.
[Rory rushes over to the fridge, as Paris enters the dorm, hurrying to pack a bag.]
PARIS: Oh, thank you very much for kicking my undefined sexual male partner out of the room that we share.
RORY: I had company coming, Paris.
PARIS: You insulted him, you demeaned him. You mad him feel unwelcome.
RORY: He was unwelcome.
PARIS: And now, thanks to you, he refuses to come back here which means I have to spend the night over at his place with his three roommates! The place is a health violation. Things grow on the windowsill without the help of pots or soil and there is the faint aroma of sweat socks and starter cologne lingering in the air at all times, and yes! I have to bring my own toilet paper over there because it is a third world country. Thank you! Very, very much!
[Paris storms out of the dorm. Rory heads back to the couch with a soda for Marty.]
MARTY: God, I missed this place.
[They lean back on the couch.]
STARS HOLLOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
[Luke is backstage. The construction is well underway.]
LUKE: Now that is a counter-sunk screw, Damon. Good man. Your lesbian mother will be proud.
[The boys run off. Luke grabs Lulu as she walks by.]
LUKE: Oh, hey. Lulu. It's a big day, you know?
LULU: I know. It's so exciting.
LUKE: Yeah. But, uh, I'm still wondering where the other adults are.
LULU: They'll be here.
LUKE: Yeah, you've been saying that for days and I'm still the only person in here that doesn't have to hang his sheets out the window in the morning.
LULU: I don't understand.
LUKE: They wet their beds, Lulu.
LULU: Oh, right. Well, I promise you, Luke. By tonight, there'll be lots of grownups here for you to talk to.
LUKE: It's not about having someone to talk to, it's –
KIRK: Luke, we've got a problem.
LUKE: Yeah, what is it, Kirk?
KIRK: Well, this dairy cart you made me –
LUKE: What's wrong with it?
KIRK [lifting the handles]: It pulls too easily and the wheel doesn't wobble.
LUKE: So what?
KIRK: Well, it's too good. You built me a twenty-first century dairy cart.
LUKE: There's no such thing as a twenty-first century dairy cart.
KIRK: Exactly. Look, Tevye's a poor man. You've heard the song.
LUKE: Yes, I've heard the song, Kirk.
KIRK: Okay, so he's poor. He's tired. He's suffering, and his horse is lame. His life is hard, so pulling this cart should be hard.
LUKE: You're an actor. Pretend it's hard.
KIRK: I'm not that kind of actor. For my type of work, it has to be
legitimately hard.
[Luke kicks the cart and breaks the wheel.]
LUKE: There you go. Remember to thank me in your acceptance speech. [Luke leaves.]
KIRK: Thank you, Luke. [He tries to push the cart. He seems impressed.] Hey, this is impossible!
CARRIE: All right, kids, break's over! Kirk, let's take it from the last part of your first monologue. All right, places, everyone! [The kids run to their places in the wings.] And – music.
[The music starts.]
KIRK: Because of our traditions, we've kept our balance for many, many years. Here, in Anatevka, we have traditions for everything. How to eat, how to sleep, how to wear clothes. For instance, we always keep our heads covered, and always wear a little prayer shawl. This shows our constant devotion to God. You may ask, how did this tradition start? I'll tell you. I don't know. But it's a tradition.
[The kids start dancing onto the stage.]
KIRK: Because of our traditions, everyone knows who he is and what God expects him to do.
[They start singing.]
EVERYONE: Who, day and night, must scramble for a living? Feed his wife and children? Say his daily prayers? And who has the right, as master of the house, to have the final word at home. The papa, the papa! Tradition! The papa, the papa! Tradition!
[They start dancing around again. A girl stumbles a little.]
LUKE [rushing onto the stage]: Hey, she tripped! Yente tripped!
KIRK: Damn it! I was feeling it, people! I was feeling it!
LULU: Anna, honey, are you okay?
LUKE: No, she's not okay! She tripped!
CARRIE: She's fine, Luke.
LUKE: How would you know if she's fine? Your kid's under a chair somewhere.
LULU: Luke –
LUKE: Her costume doesn't fit.
LULU: We'll fix it before the show!
LUKE: It should've been fixed by now! I mean, this shouldn't have happened! There were supposed to be other adults here! This is ridiculous! This is completely unacceptable! [He storms off the stage.]
KIRK: He takes his work very seriously. I mean it. Just try and pull this cart.
LORELAI'S GARAGE
[Luke's truck pulls into the driveway. He slams the door of his truck as he gets out. Lorelai is putting appliqué flowers on the wall. Luke approaches her.]
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey. Luke, what are you –
LUKE: Yente tripped!
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: She tripped, just as she was heading out to tell Avram about Ruchel.
LORELAI: The shoemaker's daughter?
LUKE: Yeah, she's trying to fix him up with Avram's son.
LORELAI: She's almost blind, she can hardly see.
LUKE: Hey, I am not doing a bit with you here. The kid tripped, because her dress was too long!
LORELAI: Okay, is she hurt?
LUKE: Of course she's not hurt, but she completely blew her entrance. All the people of Anatevka are standing around with their goats, she tripped and they have to reset the goats!
LORELAI: Luke –
LUKE: And if you were there where you were supposed to be, her costume would've fit, and Yente wouldn't have tripped.
LORELAI [getting mad]: What do you mean, where I was supposed to be?
LUKE: You're making the costumes. At least that's the rumor. I'm making the sets, and I'm there.
LORELAI: Yeah. I am making the costumes. I'm making the costumes here and then I'm bringing them there when they are done.
LUKE: Oh, sure. A likely story.
LORELAI: Hey, what is your problem?
LUKE: My problem is that I'm spending the day teaching a bunch of kids to use tools which won't properly fit in their hands for another eight to ten years, because you signed me up to do it, and then you're not even there when you're supposed to be!
LORELAI: Well, you could've said no.
LUKE: I could've said no. Have you tried saying no to Bradley when he's got a giant inhaler shoved in his mouth?
LORELAI: No.
LUKE: Well you can't! [He notices the decorated garage.] What the hell am I looking at?
LORELAI: It's my new special alone space.
LUKE: Oh, yeah? Well, you got a whole house of special alone space.
LORELAI [hurt]: Not like this.
LUKE: So, what, are you going to hang out in your garage, now?
LORELAI: I don't know, maybe! I mean, why not? It's not like I have a boat that needs storage, or anything!
LUKE: You could park your car in here.
LORELAI: I never park my car in here! I have never, ever parked my car in here, Luke! And you know that! But I come home to this big, huge, suddenly empty space, and I thought I would try to do something nice, so it wasn't just a giant hole of depression sitting out here!
LUKE: I thought I was doing you a favor.
LORELAI: Oh, please.
LUKE: I did!
LORELAI: Well, gee, thanks a lot.
LUKE: It's your garage!
LORELAI: Whatever.
LUKE: I mean, what was I supposed to do, leave the thing in here forever?
LORELAI: Oh, no. Absolutely not. Much better to sneak it out of here and park it in front of the diner like a giant "they broke up" billboard for the whole town to see.
LUKE: I didn't mean it like that.
LORELAI: Well, how did you mean it, Luke?
LUKE: I can't believe you're mad at me for getting my boat out of your garage!
LORELAI: I'm not mad at you for getting your boat out of my garage. I'm mad at you for the way you got the boat out of my garage.
LUKE: What, did I ruin the lawn?
LORELAI: You didn't even call me, Luke. You didn't leave a message or a note or anything. You just snuck in and took it, and I got to come home and find it gone. Although, I didn't come home and find it gone! I drove by the diner and assumed it was gone! You know what, it doesn't matter. ‘Cause it's done. We're done. It's fine. I'm not mad.
LUKE: I can tell.
LORELAI: Well, I have dresses to make, so I'll see you at the theater. [She walks to the house.]
[Luke shakes his head.]
YALE DORMS - RORY'S COMMON ROOM
[Rory and Marty are watching a movie. They appear much more comfortable than they were. Rory's legs are in Marty's lap.]
MARTY: I am going to say something that will upset possibly everyone in the entire world.
RORY: Wow.
MARTY: I thought the I Love Lucy episode with Harpo Marx was lame.
RORY [gasps]: Get out.
MARTY: There's no way Harpo even for a second would have believed he was looking in a mirror. And the last time they made that ‘popping up from behind the partition' move, Lucy was totally slower than him.
RORY: You've carried this with you for a very long time.
MARTY: I mean, we had to believe a lot during those Hollywood shows. Dori Shary just happened to be hanging out in their pool. And I'm sorry, I was totally with Lucy when Ricky took those women to the premiere of his movie. What an ass.
RORY: You've got to stop watching I Love Lucy.
[They hear someone knock on the door.]
MARTY: Oh, man, I hope that's Paris. Maybe she and Doyle had a fight. That would be great.
RORY [getting up]: There's so much darkness under this bosom buddies exterior of yours. [She opens the door.]
LOGAN: Hello stranger.
RORY: Hi. You're back.
LOGAN: Just rolled in.
RORY: So, how was it? Was it fun?
LOGAN: No, very dull. Let's not talk about it. We're all going to China
Palace for food. Grab your coat, let's go.
RORY: Oh, um. I can't.
LOGAN: What? Sure you can. Come on. I missed you, let me buy you a fortune cookie.
RORY: I kind of have company.
LOGAN: Really, anyone I know? [He looks in over Rory's shoulder. Marty stands up.] Hey, Marty, good to see you.
MARTY: Uh, yeah. You too.
LOGAN: Well, you come too. The more the merrier.
RORY: Oh, well –
LOGAN: Come on, Marty. If you're going to be hanging with Ace like this, it's time I get to know you without a waiter's uniform on. Let's go. Car's waiting outside. [He leaves.]
RORY: We do not have to go.
MARTY: But you want to.
RORY: No. Well, I mean, if you do. But you don't, so forget it.
MARTY: Uh, it's cool. Let's go.
RORY: Really? Are you sure? Because you don't look sure.
MARTY: Sure. I'm sure. Car's waiting outside.
RORY: Okay. But if we get bored, or if Dori Shary happens to be there then we bail.
MARTY: Deal.
RORY: Okay, I'll get my coat.
[Marty takes a deep breath.]
CHINA PALACE
[The group is laughing and talking.]
LOGAN: I swear, I thought he was never going to wake up.
COLIN: If I knew the hangover was going to last that long I wouldn't have.
ROSEMARY: There's nothing like a ‘you wouldn't believe how drunk I was' story to get the girls all hot.
COLIN: It always worked before.
JULIET: Oh, God, the smell of this food is making me ill.
RORY: Mmm, I think it's delicious.
JULIET: How can you eat like that?
ROSEMARY: Juliet hasn't eaten a meal since 1994.
JULIET: My metabolism simply doesn't accept food.
LOGAN: Yes, that must be it. A modern medical miracle. May I? [He pours some of his beer into Rory's glass.]
RORY: Sure. Hey, Marty, do you want some beer?
LOGAN: Here you go, man. I got you. [He pours.]
MARTY: Thanks.
FINN: Rosemary's going home with me tonight. I just thought everyone at this table should know.
ROSEMARY: Oh, Finn, you do hallucinate.
JULIET: Are you going to eat that fried shrimp?
RORY: I think I am.
JULIET: Oh, God, can I watch?
LOGAN: Juliet, just eat something!
JULIET: No! I am not eating until I get married to some gorgeous but very poor man who will sign an iron-clad pre-nup and get very, very fat, but he won't ever leave me because he would be cut off without a penny and die in a trailer park.
FINN: My God, that is brilliant.
ROSEMARY: That is sick.
FINN: I agree with anything Rosemary says tonight.
ROSEMARY: Not going home with you, Finn.
[Logan starts twirling Rory's hair.]
COLIN: You know where they had the best Chinese food in the world? This tiny little place outside of Zugerberg.
LOGAN: Aw, Zugerberg.
FINN: The golden days of Zugerberg.
MARTY: What's Zugerberg?
COLIN: Zugerberg is the boarding school I went to in Switzerland.
RORY: Really?
COLIN: Yep. Grade seven through twelve.
RORY: Wow. Living in Switzerland? That sounds exciting.
MARTY: Boarding school. Man, that must've sucked.
COLIN: Sucked? Are you kidding? Those are the greatest days of my life. Oh my God, the partying that went on there. Insane.
LOGAN: I did a year at Andover. Not bad.
MARTY: So you didn't miss your home, your family?
COLIN: My family? Did I miss my family? [chuckling] Logan, did I miss my family?
LOGAN: Huh, let's see. Which mom were you on then?
COLIN: I believe it was the blonde.
LOGAN: Ah, yes.
FINN: She was hot.
COLIN: You didn't know her, Finn.
FINN: All your mothers have been hot, Colin.
COLIN: No, Marty, I didn't miss my family.
[They all laugh.]
STARS HOLLOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
[The play is going on.]
BOY: Tevye. I suppose you know why I've come to see you.
KIRK: Yes, I do, Rabbi Lazar, but there's no use talking about it.
BOY: Why not?
KIRK: Why yes? Why should I get rid of her?
BOY: Well, you have a few more without her.
KIRK: I see. Today you want one, tomorrow you may want two.
[BACKSTAGE, Lorelai is fixing a costume.]
LORELAI [hushed]: Hold still, hold still. Looks good. There you go. Now, no more bottle butting till the show's over.
[Luke brings out a chair and gives it to a child.]
LUKE: Here you go, Paulie. Sneak that out there when they start dancing.
[ONSTAGE]
KIRK: Why is it so important to you?
BOY: Frankly, because I'm lonesome.
KIRK: Lonesome? What are you talking about?
BOY: You don't know?
KIRK: We're talking about my new cow! The one you want to buy from me.
[BACKSTAGE, Carrie has approached Luke. She stands next to him and pinches his butt.]
LUKE [threatening]: I've got a hammer.
CARRIE: Oh, I know you do.
[ONSTAGE]
BOY: A milk cow? So I won't get lonesome? [laughs]
KIRK: What's so funny?
BOY: I was talking about your daughter.
[BACKSTAGE, Luke and Lorelai look at each other. They each seem about to say something. Lulu hurries over.]
LULU: I need that schwanza.
LORELAI: Oh, I got it. I got it.
LULU: Sarah – where'd Sarah go?
LORELAI: Relax, we'll find her.
[Lorelai goes with Lulu.]
CHINA PALACE
[They are finished eating.]
LOGAN: Okay, the night's young. Where are we going next?
RORY: I don't think I can move.
JULIET: You're full?
RORY: I'm full.
JULIET: Is it fabulous?
RORY: You know, Juliet, it doesn't suck.
FINN: Let's go to the Alligator Lounge.
LOGAN: Yes. Perfect. Zydeco music. You'll love this place.
RORY: Well, I –
LOGAN: What do you say, Marty? You up for a little Cajun craziness?
MARTY: Uh, I –
COLIN: Okay. I got it. Everybody owes seventy-five bucks. Pony up, please, so we can get the hell out of here.
MARTY: Seventy-five?
LOGAN [to Rory]: I got you.
RORY: Okay. [to Marty] Are you okay? Do you have enough?
MARTY: Uh, I don't –
LOGAN: Hey, don't sweat it, man. I can cover you, too.
MARTY: No thanks.
LOGAN: It's no big deal. I invited you. My treat.
MARTY: It's okay. [He gets up.] I just need to find an ATM. I'll be right back. [He leaves.]
RORY: Marty –
COLIN: An ATM. My, how quaint.
RORY: I'll be right back.
LOGAN: You okay?
RORY: Oh, yeah. No, I'm fine. I just – I think I remember seeing a bank across the street, so I'll go catch Marty.
[She leaves. Logan glares at Colin.]
CHINA PALACE – OUTSIDE
[Rory comes outside. She sees Marty standing with his hands in his pockets, looking at the sidewalk.]
RORY: You couldn't find an ATM?
MARTY: Oh, no, there's at least six ATM's within a two block radius. And every single one of them is going to tell me that I only have eighteen dollars in my account. And then I believe they will flip me off.
RORY: Well, I think some of the more reputable banks have suspended their
flipping off policies.
MARTY: I can't go back in there. I can't leave. So here I stand, frozen on the sidewalk.
RORY: Here. I have some money.
MARTY: No.
RORY: Marty, just take it.
MARTY: I'm not going to take your money.
RORY: Well, you're not going to just stand out here for the rest of the night.
MARTY: Well, why not?
RORY: Because. At the very least, when all those guys come out of the restaurant, they'll see you. Come on. Please, Marty. Look, just say you found an ATM, take the money, we'll go inside, you'll hand it to the guys, and then we'll leave. You and me.
MARTY: What about the Zydeco club?
RORY: Well, I've never felt the need for Zydeco before in my life. No need to change that now. Come on, please?
[Marty accepts the money that Rory is holding out.]
MARTY: Yeah. And I thought getting pantsed at the prom was going to be the low point in my life.
[Rory comforts him as they walk back inside.]
STARS HOLLOW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
[The play is still going on. Kirk is onstage with his "wife". They are singing.]
KIRK: Do you love me?
GOLDE: Do I what?
KIRK: Do you love me?
GOLDE: Do I love you? With our daughters getting married, and the trouble in the town, you're upset, you're worn out, go inside, go lie down! Maybe it's indigestion.
KIRK: Golde, I'm asking you a question.
[Backstage, Luke is putting the finishing touches on a cart. Lorelai has just finished repairing a costume.]
LUKE [to kid]: Okay, go.
[They both take a moment to watch the duet.]
KIRK: Do you love me?
GOLDE: I'm your wife!
KIRK: I know! But do you love me?
GOLDE: Do I love him? For twenty-five years I've lived with him, fought with him, starved with him. Twenty-five years my bed is his. If that's not love, what is?
[Backstage, Lorelai looks close to tears. She nearly glances at Luke.]
KIRK: Then you love me?
GOLDE: I suppose I do.
KIRK: And I suppose I love you too.
KIRK and GOLDE: It doesn't change a thing, but even so, after twenty-five years, it's nice to know.
[Applause. Backstage, Lorelai applauds and she and Luke look at each other. They turn toward each other, as if to begin a conversation. Just then, the children rush toward the stage for the next scene, right between Luke and Lorelai. A child pulls Luke over to Kirk's dairy cart. The moment is over.]
YALE CAMPUS
[Marty is walking Rory home.]
MARTY: I'll pay you back next weekend.
RORY: Marty, please forget about it.
MARTY: I work a party Saturday night. I'll pay you on Sunday. There's a possibility it may all be in ones, but –
RORY [grabs his arm]: I'm really sorry about tonight.
MARTY: No need to apologize.
[They arrive at her door.]
RORY: You want to come in? We still have a few movies left to watch.
MARTY: Rory, I feel like I really need to tell you something.
RORY: Okay.
MARTY: Um, I know we're friends. [He smiles.] And I'm glad we're friends. But I don't want to be just friends anymore. I like you.
RORY: I like – Logan.
MARTY: Yeah. I figured.
RORY: I don't know why.
MARTY: Really? ‘Cause I've got a few guesses.
RORY: I'm sorry. Um, I don't know what to say.
MARTY: It's okay. You don't have to say anything.
RORY: Are we still friends? Please say that we're still friends.
MARTY: Sure. We're still friends.
RORY: Please come back in. We can watch Duck Soup again. Please?
MARTY: I don't really want to watch Duck Soup right now, Rory. I really like Duck Soup, so I really don't want to associate it with this particular night.
RORY: I understand.
MARTY: Yeah. [He sighs and heads up the stairs. He stops halfway.] I'll pay you back next weekend.
RORY: Okay.
[Rory watches him continue up the stairs.]
YALE DORMS – RORY'S BEDROOM – LATER
[Rory is lying in bed. She hears a knocking on the window. She puts her book away, gets up and opens the blinds. It is Logan. She opens the window.]
LOGAN: Hey.
RORY: Hey.
LOGAN: Can I? [He gestures inside.]
RORY: Yeah, sure.
[Logan climbs in the window and closes it.]
LOGAN: Huh. That move always seems cooler in the movies.
RORY: No, I think you maneuver your way through a window quite gracefully.
LOGAN: Thank you.
RORY: I assume you've had practice.
LOGAN: No, first time.
RORY: I'm sure. [He strokes her arm.] So, how was the Zydeco music?
LOGAN: Ah, I left when Finn jumped in on vocals.
RORY: Excellent self-preservational instinct.
LOGAN: I just wanted to make sure you got home okay.
RORY: Oh, yeah, I got home okay.
LOGAN: So I see.
RORY: Thanks for the concern, I appreciate it.
LOGAN: It wasn't all concern.
RORY: Oh, really?
LOGAN: No. I don't believe I said a proper goodnight to you this evening.
RORY: No, you didn't.
LOGAN: Good night, Ace.
[They kiss.]
RORY: I thought you said a proper goodnight.
[She takes off his jacket as they kiss again.]
LOGAN: You want to get changed into something more comfortable?
RORY: More comfortable than this?
LOGAN: I actually was hoping for some feetsie pajamas.
RORY: Oh, now you know I'm not that kind of girl.
[They kiss again, more passionately.]
LOGAN: Do you want me to go?
[She kisses him.]
LOGAN: Rory, do you want me to go?
RORY: No.
LOGAN: Okay, ‘cause if you think climbing in that window was hard –
RORY: Shh.
[She pulls him down onto the bed.]

LORELAI'S HOUSE
[At the front door, Lorelai is receiving her mail from the mailman.]
LORELAI: Thanks, Skip! Love that you're back in shorts. Missed those stems of yours, baby. [She closes the door and sorts through her mail.] Now, come on.
[She picks up the phone and dials. Rory answers.]
RORY: Hello?
LORELAI: Yeah, we've got to talk mail.
RORY: Not again.
LORELAI: It's all for you. Every piece. How can that be? You only half live
here.
[Scene cuts between Rory's dorm and Lorelai's living room.]
RORY: This mail envy of yours is not pretty.
LORELAI: Catalogues, business solicitations, credit card offers, oh! And for me, some more stupid Greenpeace return address labels.
RORY: Well, you are the environmental philanthropist in the family.
LORELAI: Well, I feel very badly for the planet right now.
RORY: Hey, you called my cell.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Well, I told you to call my land line. My cell phone bill is astronomical.
LORELAI: But a conversation with me, priceless. [She continues sorting the mail, then holds up a postcard.] Oh, joy.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Well, I did get a piece of mail. The temple of Apollo.
RORY: Grandma still hitting you with the postcards, huh?
LORELAI: As if nothing even remotely unpleasant happened between us. How does she do that? Compartmentalize like that? It's weird. She's the serial k*ll who goes to work and talks about a funny Seinfeld he saw and then goes home and cooks himself a man-flesh sandwich.
RORY: Ew.
LORELAI: Let's see how her trip has been since the last card. [Pretends to read] Dear Lorelai, kicked a dog then punched a gypsy in the groin. Oh, that's nice.
RORY: Mom –
LORELAI [continuing her bit]: Complained about the foie gras to a waiter whose yearly pay is less than I spend monthly on silver polish, then kicked another dog.
RORY: Come on.
LORELAI: Tripped a nun, then b*rned down an orphanage.
RORY: Sounds like a busy itinerary.
LORELAI: And the sun sets on Apollo. [She rips the postcard in half.]
RORY: At least you don't get the nothing said all about it reminders about Friday night dinner.
LORELAI: She's putting her hooks in you, huh?
RORY: Yeah, three cards in a row, reminding me in no uncertain terms that they'll see me soon.
LORELAI: Well, she's smart enough not to do that to me.
RORY: Well, I'm mad at her too, you know. Just for the record.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Anything else?
LORELAI: Whoa. One minute of talk, and then I get the bum's rush?
RORY: I'm right in the middle of studying.
LORELAI: I gotta pop out of an envelope for you to have an interest in me?
RORY: I'll be home Friday. We'll eat, we'll talk, we'll laugh. What a time we'll have.
LORELAI: Skip's back in shorts.
RORY: I am not wasting cell phone minutes on Skip's shorts!
LORELAI: It's the Reno 911 short shorts. Ooh, disturbing.
RORY: I'm hanging up now.
LORELAI: Fine. So Friday?
RORY: Friday. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye-bye.
OPENING CREDITS
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke bangs the coffee pot down on the coffeemaker. He picks up a plate of food, carries it to a table, bashing into a waiter on his way, and clatters it down in front of a customer. Lane walks over to Zach, who is sitting, reading a magazine, with his feet up on another chair.]
LANE: Sit up.
ZACH: Huh?
LANE: Sit up and feet off the chair.
ZACH: What's with being a Chilean dictator dude?
LANE: Luke is on a tear, so this is for your own protection.
ZACH: He's always on a tear.
LANE: This is different! And you have to pay today.
ZACH: For the ice-cold, undercooked fries? I don't think so.
LANE: Zach, please! [She kicks his feet off the chair.]
ZACH: Ow!
LANE: I do this because I care for you. You know I care for you, right?
ZACH: Yeah. Gosh.
CUSTOMER: Excuse me, miss?
LANE: Can I help you?
CUSTOMER: Sorry to be a pest, but I asked for my omelette soft. This is way overdone.
LANE: Shh. Not so loud.
[Luke storms over and opens the door.]
CUSTOMER: You should probably make me another –
[He is cut off as Luke grabs him under the arms and throws him into the street. He proceeds to slam the door.]
LUKE: How's everyone else's eggs, huh?
REMAINING CUSTOMERS: Great.
[Luke stares at Zach. Zach un-crumples some bills and places them on the table.]
ZACH: That's all I've got, man.
[Luke glares and heads back to the counter.]
ZACH [to Lane]: His eyes. Red, like the fires of Mordor.
LANE: Go, go. I'll see you later, and keep low! [Zach leaves.] How are you doing, Kirk?
KIRK: Great. I'm loving this blackened Cajun bread Luke made for me. I didn't even ask for it.
LANE: That's burnt toast, Kirk. You don't have to eat it.
KIRK: But I'm loving it! And look. [He scrapes some toast crumbs onto his food.] I've been mixing blackened ash with the runny eggs. Goes great with the fishy tasting bacon.
LANE: Glad you like it.
LUKE: Order's up!
LANE [picking up the plate]: Uh, Luke?
LUKE: What?
LANE: Um, I know you're really busy back there – Is that the door to the oven?
LUKE: It fell off when I kicked it. Something wrong?
LANE: Well, I needed a side of hash browns for table three, and I'm really, really sorry, but this is hash. I think. I mean, it's hash-like.
LUKE: They'll eat it.
LANE: They might, or they might go have breakfast at Weston's like the lady with the walker you threw out about an hour ago.
LUKE: So, let ‘em go to Weston's. [Shouting] Huh? All of you! If you can eat ceramic cow creamers and kitty cat salt and pepper shakers and stupid little flowers drawn in powdered sugar on your plate, then that's where you belong anyway! [Some customers get up and leave.]
LANE [to Kirk]: Unidentified breakfast food, on the house?
KIRK: Terriff. [He takes the plate from her.]
DRAGONFLY INN – FRONT DESK
[Lorelai is on the phone. As she is talking, Sookie comes in.]
LORELAI: No, I don't understand. Well, yes, of course I'll hold. I thought you'd never ask.
SOOKIE: How's your reservation book looking?
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Are we booked up, half full, kinda light?
LORELAI: For when?
SOOKIE: Next two to three months.
LORELAI: Um, we're fairly booked. I'd say eighty, ninety percent.
SOOKIE: Eighty, ninety percent! Now, did they seem hungry?
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Oh, and where are they from? Any from Jersey? People from Jersey love my Chinese chicken salad. Any Texans? Oh, any from France?
LORELAI [on the phone]: Yes, I'm still here. Yes, great. [On hold again] What's the panic, Sookie?
SOOKIE: What's the panic? I'm giving birth!
LORELAI: Right now?
SOOKIE: No, not right now, but eventually. And when I do, I'll have to have all the menus made out, and a food order put in, and a backup plan, in case there's a bad tomato crop, or if Oprah decides to get mad at beef again.
LORELAI: Hello, Blaine! Yes, you were about to explain to me the reason you once again raised our premium here. [Pause] Uh-huh. Those were all very small claims due to the snow, and – right. Well, who else would we come to, but our trusty insurance agent. Guy. Stud. Pick the appropriate term and insert here. Now. Eh – yes, well, of course. Holding's one of my great pleasures.
SOOKIE: Problem?
LORELAI: The charmers at our insurance agency get mad when you try to claim something.
SOOKIE: The stable roof.
LORELAI: Yes, and – and now I've been disconnected. Coincidence? I think not.
SOOKIE [Pointing at the computer]: Have people made dinner reservations?
LORELAI: Be my guest.
SOOKIE: Okay.
[The phone rings.]
LORELAI: Dragonfly Inn, Lorelai speaking.
EMILY: Lorelai, it's your mother, I –
[She is cut off as Lorelai hangs up the phone.]
SOOKIE: Hey, we've got vegetarians in April! What, were you hiding them?
LORELAI: Yes, I'm evil that way.
[The phone rings again.]
LORELAI: Dragonfly Inn, Lorelai speaking.
EMILY: Lorelai, you just hung up –
[Lorelai hangs up again.]
LORELAI: Hey, so who do you think will take over while you're gone?
SOOKIE: I was thinking about Chantelle.
LORELAI: The one who got her face caught in the mixer?
SOOKIE: She's better now. She just got her new nostril last week.
LORELAI: That's good.
[The phone rings.]
LORELAI: Dragonfly Inn.
RICHARD: Ah, yes. Lorelai. It's your father.
LORELAI: Oh, Dad! How was your trip?
RICHARD: Fine, Lorelai. Thank you very much.
LORELAI: And the flight back?
RICHARD: Very smooth.
LORELAI: Smooth is good.
RICHARD: Actually, your mother wanted to talk to you for a moment. [He hands the phone to Emily.]
EMILY: Hello, Lorelai, I –
[Lorelai hangs up the phone.]
LORELAI: Hey, do you have any of that really great braised lamb risotto thing leftover from last night?
SOOKIE: I think so, why?
LORELAI: Well, since I'm not going to Friday night dinner tonight or ever again, and I'm not in the mood for pizza, I thought I'd have a little fancy food with my movie.
SOOKIE: You're going to a movie!
LORELAI: I Netflixed all three ‘A Star is Born's.
SOOKIE: Janet, Judy and Babs.
LORELAI: The holy trinity. I thought I'd hunker down with some fabulous food and watch all the men that got away.
SOOKIE: What? No, you can't do that!
LORELAI: Why not?
SOOKIE: Because! Look, I'm worried about you.
LORELAI: Why?
SOOKIE: Just because you don't have someone in your life right now –
LORELAI: Meaning Luke.
SOOKIE: And your parents, and your Friday night dinners, and Rory's off at college –
LORELAI: I do, however, have my original nostril.
SOOKIE: You can't use that as an excuse to become couch potato girl.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
SOOKIE: Sitting at home. Ordering take-out. Watching television night after night.
LORELAI: That's what I've always done. I was couch potato girl even when I had a guy. And Friday night dinner. And, by the way, the entire time Rory was growing up.
SOOKIE: Yes, but now it's pathetic.
LORELAI: Well, just a little.
SOOKIE: You are not sitting home tonight! We are going out!
LORELAI: We are?
SOOKIE: Girl's night out, just you and me. Oh, it'll be fun. Big excitement, big hair! We'll get all dolled up and paint the town!
LORELAI: But –
SOOKIE: I am coming to your house tonight, at seven o'clock sharp, and I am taking you out, and you better look hot! You hear me?
LORELAI: Yes I do.
SOOKIE [giggles]: Good.
LORELAI: But remember, I don't put out unless I get dinner.
SOOKIE [heading back to the kitchen]: I know. I saw your bumper sticker.
[She leaves.]
YALE CAMPUS
[Rory is placing her order at a coffee cart.]
RORY: Hi. I'd like a large caramel macchiato with an extra sh*t and whip cream, please.
COFFEE BOY: Coming up.
RORY: Wait, hold on. How much is that?
COFFEE BOY: Four eighty-five.
RORY: Okay, better drop the extra sh*t. What does that make it?
COFFEE BOY: Four twenty.
RORY: Better make it a small. What does that make it?
COFFEE BOY: Three thirty.
RORY: Better drop the whip cream. What does that make it?
COFFEE BOY: Less calories.
RORY: Just a plain old small coffee, please. [She turns around and drops her change all over the ground.] D'oh.
[She crouches down. Logan stops to help her pick up the coins.]
LOGAN: This would definitely qualify as a cute meet if we hadn't already met.
RORY: Logan. Hey. This is nice and embarassing.
LOGAN: Are we going after the rollers? A couple of them are headed into the bushes.
RORY: No, I think I've supplied people with a sufficient amount of silly images of me for one day.
LOGAN: Small coffee for me, and put the lady's on my tab too.
RORY: No, Logan, you don't have to do that.
LOGAN: Ace, I can't take a chance of you pulling out that purse again. Someone might get hurt. [He pays for the coffee.]
RORY: Okay, well, thank you.
LOGAN: So I stopped by the paper the other day to see you.
RORY: Really?
LOGAN: And then I tried to sneak out when I realized you weren't there. But our omnipresent editor cornered me. Does Doyle ever leave that place?
RORY: Unfortunately yes, otherwise I would be denied the regular pleasure of seeing him in Property of Alcatraz pajama pants.
LOGAN: Thanks for the image. Hey, come here. [He pulls her into a corner.]
RORY: What are you doing?
[They kiss.]
RORY: So that's what you're doing.
LOGAN: What'd you think I was doing?
[They kiss again. Rory turns away.]
RORY: People will see.
LOGAN: I don't care if people see.
RORY: A professor will see you, and he'll take advantage of the fact that you're distracted and pull you in, make you take a midterm.
LOGAN: I'm done with them.
RORY: With your midterms?
LOGAN: I already took the ones I couldn't get out of.
RORY: Then why are you here? You're going off skiing, aren't you?
LOGAN: I just have to drop off a paper for my ethics class by eleven thirty and then I'm off.
RORY: It's eleven twenty-five.
LOGAN: So we're swimming in time.
[He pulls her in to kiss her again. Rory breaks away.]
LOGAN: What are you doing?
RORY [reaching into his bookbag]: I want to see your paper.
LOGAN: Your mind is a mysterious thing.
RORY: Come on. I'm dying to know what your take on ethics is. For instance, are you for it or against it?
LOGAN: No way. It's too dangerous.
RORY: Dangerous?
LOGAN: I actually worked on this thing. It goes from my hand to the professor's.
RORY: Like I'm going to lose it.
LOGAN: I saw you with your coins, plus let's remember Hemingway.
RORY: What about him?
LOGAN: Trusted that wife of his with the only copy he had of the novel he was working on. The silly woman lost it.
RORY: Not so. I know the story. Hemingway left it on a plane. His wife had nothing to do with it.
LOGAN: That's not the way I heard it.
RORY: Well, you heard it wrong.
LOGAN: How much you want to bet?
RORY: All the money in my purse, plus a million dollars.
LOGAN: Well, my spelling stinks. Take my word for it.
[He kisses her again.]
RORY: You'll call me from the cabin?
LOGAN: Absolutely.
RORY: Thanks for the coffee.
LOGAN: Anytime. Better have that million bucks ready when I get back, and I don't accept coins.
RORY: No promises.
[They head off in different directions.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is in the kitchen, making coffee. We hear Rory come in the front door.]
RORY [OS]: Hello!
LORELAI: Kitchen!
RORY [OS]: Ow! Rat bastard!
LORELAI: Are you okay?
RORY [OS]: Give me a hand!
[Lorelai starts clapping as Rory enters the kitchen pulling several large laundry bags.]
RORY: Okay, Bob Hope's laughing in heaven, but I'm not.
LORELAI: Bob Hope got into heaven?
RORY: Please grab a bag.
LORELAI: This cannot all be laundry.
RORY: It's all laundry. The machine's fixed, right?
LORELAI: Yes, humming like new. Which one's the rat bastard?
RORY [pointing]: That one.
LORELAI [kicks the laundry bag]: Take that! And that!
RORY: Okay, he's had enough! I want to get a load going before I go to Grandma's.
LORELAI: Good idea.
[Rory exits out the back door, then comes back in.]
RORY: Hey, you're using it!
LORELAI: Yes, I know.
RORY: Well, but I had dibs.
LORELAI: No, you didn't call dibs.
RORY: I'm a college student coming home on Spring Break. That implies dibs on the washer and drier.
LORELAI: There's no implied dibs in dibs. If you don't call it, you don't get it.
[Rory goes back outside.]
RORY [OS]: Well, this is just wrong!
LORELAI: What?
[Rory comes back in.]
RORY: You're washing two socks!
LORELAI: Well, they were dirty.
RORY: That's wasteful.
LORELAI: I really wanted to wear them tonight.
RORY: They are your dancing Santa Claus socks. You're not going to wear those for another ten months.
LORELAI: No, I can wear them eccentrically any time I want!
RORY: Well, then you're going to have to put one of my loads I while I'm gone.
LORELAI: And risk a hernia?
RORY: I'll never finish otherwise!
LORELAI: I'll do two loads. How's that?
RORY: Thank you. All right, I've got to take off.
LORELAI: Okay. Drive safe, and you've got gas, right?
RORY: Yeah, I've got gas.
LORELAI: Okay. Enough gas to get to Hartford?
RORY: I think so. Why?
LORELAI: Oh, well, because I've got a twenty – ah! A twenty! On the fridge, here! Look! Oh, here it is. I'm not going to use it. You should use it for gas.
RORY: Is it that obvious I'm broke?
LORELAI: Well, you mentioned the minutes on your cell phone, a hint of panic in your voice, and now the months of saved up laundry.
RORY: Well, there are just no good jobs at Yale right now, and I'd take anything. Trust me.
LORELAI: Well, I took the liberty of asking around town for you. Made you sound all pathetic and ragged. And there are a few temporary things you could take. You are very in demand in Stars Hollow.
RORY: Like what?
LORELAI: Well, the radio station needs someone to drive up the hill a couple of times a day and shoo the cows away from the transmitter.
RORY: I'm not good with livestock.
LORELAI: Well, the road crew needs a part-time ‘Slow Down' sign holder-upper. You get to wear a helmet.
RORY: I don't think so.
LORELAI: I saved the best for last. Andrew needs help doing inventory at the bookstore. I think that's probably your best bet.
RORY: That sounds great, actually.
LORELAI: Cool, just give him a ring.
RORY: Thanks. [She kisses Lorelai's cheek.] Now I just need to borrow some clothes to wear to Grandma's.
LORELAI: You're in clothes.
RORY: Well, she'll insist I take my jacket off and I'm down to my ‘Give Bush a Wedgie' t-shirt.
LORELAI [gasps]: Please wear that to Grandma's!
RORY: I'm going to borrow some clothes.
LORELAI: There's another twenty in it for you!
RORY: Start one of my loads.
LORELAI: Forty if you snap a picture of her seeing it!
RORY: Finish your socks!
[She heads upstairs.]
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE – FOYER
[The doorbell rings. Emily answers it.]
EMILY: Rory, hello! Come in!
RORY: Hi, Grandma.
[Emily hugs Rory. Rory does not hug her back.]
EMILY: Oh, we missed you.
RORY: It's only been a few weeks, Grandma.
EMILY: Give your coat to Eliza. [Rory takes off her coat.] That's an interesting outfit you have on.
RORY: Laundry day.
EMILY: Laundry day. Everything young people do sounds like fun to me.
RORY: No, it's pretty dreary.
EMILY: Well, come in. Come in. [She calls up the stairs as they enter the living room.] Richard, Rory's here. Hurry down, and don't forget to bring the you-know-what! [To Rory] Forget you heard that.
RORY: Consider it forgotten.
EMILY: Our trip was wonderful. We have so much to tell you.
RORY: Good.
[They sit down.]
EMILY: We'll have to wait ‘till next week to show you pictures. Richard bought this new digital camera that's supposed to be so simple a child can use it. So now we need to find a child who'll show us how. [She laughs. Rory barely smiles.] Are you feeling okay?
RORY: I'm feeling fine.
EMILY: So, did you go to Athens on that first big European trip of yours?
RORY: Um, yeah.
EMILY: I hope you saw the National Archaeological museum. I thought of you there the whole time. The room with the Mask of Agamemnon?
RORY: Yep, we hit that.
EMILY: Interesting, huh?
RORY: Yep.
[Richard makes his way down the stairs.]
RICHARD: Rory!
RORY [stands up]: Grandpa! Welcome home! [They hug.]
RICHARD: Well, thank you! Look at this outfit! I like the colors.
RORY: Thanks! It's borrowed.
RICHARD: So, we have quite a bit to catch up on!
RORY: I know, I want to hear all about it!
RICHARD: Well, I'm sure your grandmother has caught you up somewhat.
EMILY: I started to.
RICHARD: And with the dozens of postcards she sent, you probably remember the trip better than I do.
RORY: I still want to hear your account.
EMILY: Have her open the gift, Richard.
RICHARD: Oh, yes. Please. Open it!
[Rory pulls out an antique book.]
RORY: Oh, my God, it's amazing!
RICHARD: Leaves of Grass in Greek. A hundred years old, some beautiful engravings.
RORY: Now I have to learn Greek.
EMILY: Feel the leather.
RORY: Grandpa, thank you so much.
RICHARD: Well, you can thank your grandmother. She helped pick it out.
RORY [not looking up]: Thank you, Grandma.
ELIZA: Dinner is served, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Thank you Eliza. [To Rory] You can flip through that a little later.
RORY: Okay. [She puts the book away and she and Richard head for the dining room.] So, Grandpa, is it true that every restaurant in the Placa has a view of the Acropolis?
RICHARD: Well, they like to think so. But we found this charming little taverna – Dionysus. The view was spectacular, and the Ouzo certainly lived up to its name.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Lorelai exits the front door and joins Sookie, waiting in her car.]
LORELAI: Oh, I am so hot. I'm going to hit on myself tonight.
SOOKIE: You look nice.
LORELAI: So do you, your hair is so fancy.
SOOKIE: And I'm ready to let it down!
LORELAI: So, what town are we painting first?
SOOKIE: Oh, well, it's your big night out, so anywhere you want!
LORELAI: Okay. How about dancing?
SOOKIE: Dancing! Yes! [sings and starts the car] I'm a brick – da-da-da-da house. Now, of course I can't really dance ‘cause my ankles are completely swollen, and, uh, my stomach's a bit of a hindrance on the dance floor. But I can watch you dance.
LORELAI: No, that's okay. Let's do something else!
SOOKIE: But you want to go dancing!
LORELAI: No, we'll do whatever.
SOOKIE: Like what?
LORELAI: We can go to a bar, hang out and talk.
SOOKIE: Sounds perfect! Of course, I tend to get a little depressed when I'm in a room full of people drinking and I can't have a cocktail! You know, did I tell you I'm having a recurring dream lately, about a magic pina colada? With whip cream, and a ton of rum, and a talking little paper umbrella!
LORELAI: If you're having dreams like that, you don't need a cocktail! How
about a movie?
SOOKIE: I have to get up to pee every five minutes. But, we can sit on an aisle near the back and you can fill me in on what I missed!
LORELAI: Sookie – [she turns off the car] – Why don't we just stay home?
SOOKIE: No! We're hitting the town!
LORELAI: Not tonight.
SOOKIE: We have to. I can't let you become this spinster on the couch.
LORELAI: We can go inside and order in pizza.
SOOKIE: You need to go out, and see things, and do things!
LORELAI: I have ‘A Star is Born'. All three versions. We can compare and contrast performances and dosages!
SOOKIE: It is my responsibility as your best friend to make sure you go do exciting things even when you don't want to.
LORELAI: Hanging out with you is exciting!
SOOKIE: It is?
LORELAI: And with pepperoni and some extra cheese – look out.
SOOKIE: I am getting kind of hungry!
LORELAI: Well, sure, all this partying will do that to you.
SOOKIE: Can we watch the Streisand ‘A Star is Born' first? I really love that scene where she chews on Kris Kristofferson's lip!
LORELAI: Yeah!
[Sookie giggles as they get out of the car and go back in the house.]
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE – DINING ROOM
[Rory, Richard and Emily are having dinner.]
EMILY: So, where are all of your Yale friends for Spring Break?
RORY: Oh, here and there.
EMILY: Did your friend Paris make interesting plans?
RORY: Not really.
EMILY: And how's the shortcake?
RORY: It's fine, thanks.
EMILY: I know this seems a bit basic, but Eliza found the first decent strawberries of the year. I'm so mad at California.
RICHARD: Well, you'd think that rain would be good for crops. It's counterintuitive.
EMILY: Anyway, these strawberries are wonderful. Could you pass them to me, Rory?
[Rory passes the dish without looking up. Emily mouths to Richard "Do something!" and points at Rory. Richard looks troubled.]
RICHARD: So, Rory. Is everything all right with you this evening?
RORY: I'm fine, Grandpa.
[He looks helplessly at Emily. She gestures as though to say "Go on!"]
RICHARD: You'd tell us if anything was bothering you.
RORY: Really, it's nothing.
RICHARD: Seems as though there might be something on your mind.
RORY: Not really.
RICHARD: All right.
RORY: So, Grandpa, you hardly told me anything about your trip? How was the
Archaeological museum?
EMILY: Oh, now, that's it.
RICHARD: Emily –
EMILY: What is wrong with you?
RORY: Nothing.
EMILY: I asked you about that museum earlier and all you did was mumble something about hitting it!
RORY: I should have been more expansive. I'm sorry.
EMILY: You've been pushing me away all evening!
RICHARD: Emily, please.
EMILY: You asked your grandfather question after question and make polite chit-chat about the duck with the maid, what's her name, tell her it's wonderful –
RORY: Because she made it! And her name is Eliza!
EMILY: I told her to make it! You're enjoying duck because I requested duck!
RORY: Well, it was a great duck, Grandma! Kudos on the duck!
EMILY: This isn't you, this attitude of yours. This is your mother.
RORY: Don't bring up Mom.
RICHARD: Look, both of you. Let's try to calm down.
EMILY: Why are you acting this way?
RORY: Your memory can't be that short, Grandma!
EMILY: What does that mean?
RORY: Do we really have to get into this?
EMILY: You should walk out that door and come in again. Start all over.
RICHARD: She doesn't need to do that, Emily.
EMILY: We have a contract!
RORY [Sarcastic]: A contract!
EMILY: We pay for Yale. You come to dinner every Friday night and you act pleasantly and decently.
RORY: You're right, Grandma. We do have a contract. But it's to come to dinner. Period. There's no agreement on how vivacious or bubbly I have to be.
EMILY: You need to act like you!
RORY: I am!
EMILY: This isn't you!
RORY [getting up]: Look, Grandma, you know what you did.
RICHARD: Rory, please sit down.
RORY: I mean, what did you expect? Ten Acropolis postcards and I forget the fact that you broke up Mom and Luke? Now, I respect our contract. And I will continue to come every Friday night and eat dinner with you. But I won't guarantee an attitude that will please you. Excuse me.
EMILY: You are certainly not excused, we're not through.
RORY: We have had dessert, I'll skip the port. Good night.
RICHARD: Rory.
RORY: Good night, Grandpa. I'll see you in a week.
[She leaves. Emily and Richard look at one another, shocked.]
WESTON'S BAKERY
[Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at a table.]
LORELAI: See, now, this is perfect.
SOOKIE: It's not a nightclub, but it's a place she never goes. Different and exciting.
LORELAI: And chocolaty.
SOOKIE: Are you having fun?
LORELAI: Oh, not missing the couch a bit.
WAITER: Hi, Lorelai. Wow, twice in one day, huh?
LORELAI [chuckles]: Hi, Frankie. Yeah, well, gotta have some pie, you know. [Sees Sookie looking at her.] Well, I haven't memorized the menu yet.
SOOKIE: You come here?
LORELAI: You know, just once a – day.
SOOKIE: Unbelievable.
LORELAI: Well, I have to go somewhere in the mornings.
SOOKIE: I didn't want to take you somewhere you always go!
LORELAI: I had a great time tonight, and I appreciate your concern. And I promise, I am not going to become a couch potato spinster woman.
SOOKIE [gesturing at her belly]: Okay, the minute this comes out, you and I are going away for a weekend. Just the two of us.
LORELAI: Absolutely, except for the fact that you'll have a newborn baby at home, that's a perfect plan.
[Rory enters.]
RORY: Hello, ladies!
LORELAI: Hi, kid. How'd you know we'd be here?
RORY: What do you mean? You're always here. Hey, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Hey, egghead. Do you want some pie?
RORY: Oh, I never say no to pie.
LORELAI: So how was dinner?
RORY: Loud.
LORELAI: Meaning?
RORY: There was yelling.
LORELAI: Why, what happened?
RORY: I just got so mad. She was acting like nothing was wrong. Like it was totally normal that you weren't there. And I couldn't take it.
LORELAI: I understand.
SOOKIE [leaning on her hand]: I understand too.
LORELAI: Are you getting sleepy, there, Sookie?
SOOKIE: No, I'm fine. Just a little past my bedtime is all. Keep talking.
RORY: I left during shortcake.
LORELAI: I'm sorry to hear that.
RORY: Hey, Grandma did this. You didn't.
LORELAI: I know. I just hate that you're fighting with them.
RORY: Don't worry about it. [Looks at Sookie] She's sleeping.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, we partied pretty hard tonight.
RORY: Should we wake her up?
LORELAI: Nah, we'll wait a minute.
RORY: Mom. [She gestures to the empty table next to theirs.] Can you -
LORELAI: What?
[They move to the other table.]
LORELAI: Something wrong? [Pause.] Is it about Grandma? [Pause.] Do I have to ask eighteen more of these?
RORY: You know how, with Dean, things didn't exactly go the way I planned?
LORELAI: You mean with you and him getting together?
RORY: No, I mean, yes, that too. But I promised you that I would come to you and talk to you when I thought I was ready to - but I didn't, um, because it all happened so fast and I didn't get a chance and then everything got so messed up, and then after, it was weird. The situation was weird, and I didn't feel comfortable coming to talk to you about anything concerning us at all -
LORELAI: You can always talk to me. Even when it's weird.
RORY: I know. I want to. I want to go back to talking about everything. Just like before Dean.
LORELAI: I second that motion.
RORY: So I thought I would come talk to you now about Logan.
LORELAI [surprised]: Oh. Okay.
RORY: I want to tell you now, so you hear it from me, right when it's… starting.
LORELAI: Right when it's starting? Oh. Got it. So, the two of you are starting something, huh?
RORY [smiling]: Yes. We have definitely started something.
LORELAI: Started! Oh, you have already started something. Wow. Okay, fast.
RORY: I know, but he's so great. I mean, you've seen him. He's beautiful, and really smart. Smarter than me, I swear. And he's – great.
LORELAI: Yes, he seems great.
RORY: And we have a lot in common, which is good.
LORELAI: Very good.
RORY: The paper, and Yale of course, and he's extremely well-read. And I know Logan's rich, and I know you don't really -
LORELAI: No, no. Rory, I don't care if he's rich. If you like him -
RORY: I do. I really like him.
LORELAI: And he's treating you well.
RORY: He is. I'm having fun. A lot of fun.
LORELAI: Okay, well. If he's that important to you, I should probably, you know, meet him again, under different circumstances.
RORY: Right.
LORELAI: Everything all buttoned and zipped.
RORY: You will, I promise.
LORELAI: Good, that's good.
RORY: Anyhow, I just wanted you to know.
LORELAI: Okay, so. Good talk.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Absolutely. [She sighs.] Man, I feel like I should buy you a sh*t
RORY: How about a rum ball?
LORELAI: Two rum balls, coming up.
[Rory smiles as Lorelai gets up.]
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lorelai is walking. Her cell phone rings.]
LORELAI: Hello?
RICHARD: Lorelai, it's your father.
LORELAI: Well, hello there, my father. What can I do for you?
[Scene cuts between Lorelai walking and Richard in his study.]
RICHARD: Well, you can take a more serious tone, for starters.
LORELAI [in a deep, British voice]: Oh. Hello, my father.
RICHARD: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Oh, sorry. I thought the British thing made it pretty serious.
RICHARD: I assume you heard what happened at dinner last night?
LORELAI: Did it involve a fork?
RICHARD: No, it did not. It involved your daughter being incredibly rude and insensitive to her grandmother.
LORELAI: I heard there was a bit of a flare-up there, yes.
RICHARD: It was more than a flare-up. I've never seen Rory behave like that.
LORELAI: Well, she was upset, Dad.
RICHARD: Well, that is no excuse!
LORELAI: Well, I don't know what to tell you.
RICHARD: You can tell me what you intend to do about it.
LORELAI: Uh, nothing?
RICHARD: You have to talk to her!
LORELAI: No, I do not.
RICHARD: Lorelai, you are her mother. It is up to you to set an example for your daughter.
LORELAI: I did set an example for her, Dad. I didn't go to dinner. She went anyhow, damn kids, you can't teach them anything.
RICHARD: She yelled at her grandmother, Lorelai! At the dinner table, right in front of me!
LORELAI: Well, this is none of my business.
RICHARD: Of course it's your business! It's your battle she's fighting.
LORELAI: I do not have a battle.
RICHARD: You need to talk to her and tell her that this behavior is not –
LORELAI: Dad, listen to me. This is Rory's thing, okay? She was mad. She was upset.
RICHARD: Well, what does Rory have to be upset about?
LORELAI: Rory loves Luke, Dad. She does not want to see him hurt and humiliated like he was. She cares about me.
RICHARD: Your mother did what she thought –
LORELAI: Whoa, just stop right there. I'm not interested in why Mom did what she did.
RICHARD: Well, I was just –
LORELAI: Luke and I have broken up, Dad. Okay? We are no longer together. And it is a direct result of what Mom did. And I know that you could care less, and I know that Mom will be thrilled, but I am not thrilled. I am not thrilled. And Rory is not thrilled. We're both hurt and extremely upset. Now, I can stay away and not come to dinner and not see Mom, but Rory made a deal with you guys, and Rory never goes back on anything she says, so she went. She was there, and if she was rude or cold, then I'm sorry, but I personally feel she has every right to be, and you and Mom will just have to work that out with her yourselves.
RICHARD: So then this is it? You'll never visit our home again?
LORELAI: I don't know.
RICHARD: You'll send Rory, but you'll avoid us at Thanksgiving? On
Christmas?
LORELAI: Probably.
RICHARD: So we're just supposed to accept the fact that we'll never see you again?
LORELAI: You can see me anytime you want, Dad. I have no beef with you.
RICHARD [thoughtfully]: I see. Well.
LORELAI: Uh, Dad?
RICHARD: Yes?
LORELAI: While you're all calm and quiet there, can I ask you a question?
RICHARD: Go ahead.
LORELAI: Well, the premium on my insurance policy at the inn is going up fifteen percent because of some small damage claims –
RICHARD: I'm sorry, you're asking me a question about insurance?
LORELAI: Yeah.
RICHARD: Carry on.
LORELAI: So these guys came by the Inn last week, and –
[She sees a traffic cop writing a ticket for the boat in front of Luke's.]
LORELAI: Oh. Dad, I gotta call you back in a sec, okay? Thanks. Bye. [She
hangs up and hurries over to her.] Excuse me! Hello! Hi, hi.
COP: Is this your boat?
LORELAI: Ah, technically. It is. Yeah. And I'm sorry that it's parked out here like this, but, see, it's supposed to be auctioned off for charity for the National Boating for Peace and, uh, low blood sugar organization for tiny children, and so they delivered it early and not finished, and so it was dropped off here, so, to be picked up by the boat finishing guys. I'm supposed to move it. But there was this kitten. In a tree. He had a cold, and I had to bring him a Kleenex, and –
COP: Just move it on street-cleaning days.
LORELAI: Yes, ma'am.
[The cop leaves. Lorelai sighs and looks at the boat, then walks away.]
LUKE'S DINER – INTERIOR
[Lane comes over to Kirk's table.]
LANE: You want some ketchup, Kirk?
KIRK: No, thanks. The distinct charred flavor of this meat is like a delicacy. I wouldn't dream of obscuring it with condiments.
LANE: I think that's a pancake.
KIRK: Fascinating.
[Lane heads back to the counter.]
LANE: Luke, my cheeseburger and fries up yet?
LUKE: How would I know? What am I, a food psychic? What, do you want to know
how the grapefruit crop's gonna be this year? Hold on, I'm getting a message from a kumquat from beyond the grave.
LANE: Okay, I'll go see for myself.
KIRK: Hey, Luke, can I get a napkin?
[Luke tosses a towel, which lands on Kirk's head.]
KIRK: A cloth napkin and a moist towlette, all in one!
LANE: I've got a delivery, I'll be right back!
[She heads toward the door. A man enters.]
MAN: Sit anywhere?
LANE [hushed]: Ah, listen. I will be back in fifteen minutes. Why don't you wait, and let me seat you then?
MAN: What?
LANE: Just trust me –
MAN: Forget it! I'm hungry now.
LANE: Okay. Anywhere's fine.
[She leaves the diner. As she walks down the street, behind her we can see the man being tossed out, landing on his knees on the sidewalk.]



STARS HOLLOW BOOKS
[Rory is sitting, surrounded by piles of books. Lane enters.]
LANE: Soup's on!
RORY: Oh, thank God. I am starving. I have been dreaming about Luke's cheeseburgers for a month.
LANE: How's the inventory coming?
RORY: Perfect. I have a great system going. [Pointing] This is my ‘to be written down' pile, my ‘already written down' pile, and this is my pile of books that I have seen and now have to buy.
LANE: That's a big pile.
RORY [Opening the bag of food]: Yep.
LANE: Bigger than the other two piles.
RORY: Yep.
LANE: This job must be costing you a fortune.
RORY: Yep. [She takes a bite of the burger and makes a face.] Oh, my God. What is that thing?
LANE: Sorry. I should have warned you.
RORY: This is disgusting! This is from Luke's?
LANE: Yeah, he's been a little off his game lately.
RORY: Off his game? It's like Tiger Woods made this thing.
LANE: Luke's been in a mood.
RORY: And he's taking it out on the cheeseburgers?
LANE: It's been awful. Everything's either been burnt or dropped. He's absolutely miserable. He just mopes and growls and stomps around. He throws customers out the door.
RORY: Geez.
LANE: I'm assuming his mood might have something to do with a certain someone who's been spending a lot of her time at Weston's lately.
RORY: Oh, poor, sad Luke.
LANE: Poor, sad tips.
RORY: Listen, I have to get something to eat. You want to run over to Al's with me?
LANE: Can't. If Luke's left alone too long, he might burn the place down.
RORY: Well, how about tonight? You want to do something?
LANE: I would love to, but Zach is cooking me dinner.
RORY: Really? Oh, it's so sweet.
LANE: It is, isn't it?
RORY: It's so nice that you have Zach.
LANE: I know, it's like having a perfect haircut every single day.
RORY: My God, that is beautiful.
LANE: I'll call you later?
RORY: Okay. Thanks for the concept of lunch.
LANE: Anytime.
[Lane leaves. Rory gets up and spots another book and adds it to her ‘to buy' pile.]
RORY: This job was a great idea.
[She heads across the street.]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Lorelai enters the kitchen.]
LORELAI: Hey, Sookie? Has my dad –
SOOKIE [jumping out at her]: August fourteenth!
LORELAI: Oh, geez!
SOOKIE: What are you doing August fourteenth?
LORELAI: Uh, recovering from the grand jete you just did there?
SOOKIE: Last night I called Jackson's sister – Colleen, not the drunk one and I asked her to take the kids on the weekend of August fourteenth because by then there will be kids, and I will be free to girlfriend the weekend away. What do you think?
LORELAI: Oh, sh**t.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: Well, If you had just gotten to me sooner.
SOOKIE: Sooner than six months ahead of time?
LORELAI: Well, August is my bathing month.
SOOKIE [disappointed]: Oh, well, September will probably work, and [noticing the small smile on Lorelai's face] you're joking.
LORELAI: August fourteenth would be perfect.
SOOKIE [clapping]: Oh, yay!
[Richard enters the kitchen with a business associate.]
LORELAI: Hey, Dad, how's it look?
RICHARD: Why don't you go and check that landing again, Phil? I'll be up in a moment. [He turns to Lorelai.]
LORELAI: Well, is it bad, is it good, am I screwed? What do you think?
RICHARD: Philip and I have thoroughly toured the property, and with the exception of one too many garden gnomes, we have found it to be in top shape.
LORELAI [pleased]: Really?
RICHARD: Yes. I've also reviewed your policy, and while I tip my hat to the criminal genius who convinced you to sign it, I find it appalling.
LORELAI: I knew the name Sheisty McSheisterson should have tipped me off.
RICHARD: You can do better. And I can help.
LORELAI: Don't you tease me, Gilmore.
RICHARD: Oh, no, I wouldn't dare.
LORELAI: So what do we do?
RICHARD: Well, Philip will go over the property again, he'll take some pictures, and tomorrow I will put a new policy together for you.
LORELAI: Oh my God, you're my lifesaver.
SOOKIE: Hey, can I make you guys some lunch?
RICHARD: No, thank you, Sookie.
LORELAI: Come on, Dad. Not even a sandwich?
RICHARD: I'll tell you what. I'll have some coffee, if you're offering.
LORELAI: We're offering.
SOOKIE: I'll heat up some scones to go with it.
RICHARD [calling after her]: Oh, no, I don't – uh, I don't want the –
LORELAI: Forget it, Dad. You're getting scones.
RICHARD: My God, this is a bossy place.
[They go into the dining room.]
RICHARD: You know, I have to say, Lorelai. You've done a wonderful job here.
LORELAI [surprised]: Thank you, Dad.
RICHARD: Well, the restoration. The rooms. The homey feel. And the stables – very smart.
LORELAI: Yes.
RICHARD: People love horses.
LORELAI: They turned out to be quite a draw.
RICHARD: Hmm. You know, small inns like this are very fashionable right now. The larger hotel chains are constantly searching to acquire charming places like this. They keep them just as they are, usually retain the management. I could, uh, do a little sniffing around for you if you like.
LORELAI: Are you talking about selling my inn?
RICHARD: Well, you would still run it. But you'd make a lot of money.
LORELAI: I'm good, Dad.
RICHARD: Well, you should really think about it.
LORELAI: I don't think I'm going to be selling this place, but thank you for the suggestion.
RICHARD: Yes, well, if you change your mind.
LORELAI: Yes, I know where to find you.
[A waiter brings the coffee and scones.]
RICHARD: Oh, my, what is that heavenly smell?
LORELAI: Scones.
RICHARD: I have never smelled anything as heavenly as this.
LORELAI: Wait till you taste them.
LANE'S HOUSE
[Lane and Zach are having a candlelit picnic on the floor.]
ZACH: More bubbly, my dear? [He offers her some Pepsi.]
LANE: Please.
ZACH: I opened the bottle this afternoon, so it's just the way you like it. Nice and flat.
LANE: You're very sweet. This whole thing was so sweet, Zach. Cooking me dinner?
ZACH: It was fun.
LANE: The sauce was amazing.
ZACH: My own creation. Ragu with garlic salt, cayenne pepper and a dash of wasabi.
LANE: It made my ears pop.
ZACH: One of the benefits.
LANE: Spaghetti was just right, too.
ZACH: I threw some up against the wall to tell if it was done. Made a shape like Peter Gabriel's big bloated head. It's still there if you want to see it.
LANE [getting up]: Yeah? Cool.
ZACH: But not now, okay? [He pulls her down beside him.] Later.
LANE: Oh, sure.
ZACH [kissing up her arm]: You're the best, you know. The coolest, the cutest.
LANE: Aw, thanks. Back at you.
ZACH: I liked you the day I met you. I even remember what you were wearing.
LANE: Oh, God. I probably looked like a pig. I need more clothes.
ZACH: I want this to be right, you know?
LANE: Yeah. Absolutely.
ZACH: Music's good for you?
LANE: Sure.
[They kiss.]
LANE: That was nice.
ZACH: Yeah, it was.
[They kiss again.]
LANE: We should probably clear the plates, right?
ZACH: What?
LANE: Just to get them soaking.
ZACH: No. Uh, later. After.
LANE: Okay. After what?
ZACH [leans in]: After.
LANE: Right. [They kiss] After.
[More kissing. Lane suddenly pushes away.]
LANE: Oh, my God!
ZACH: What?
LANE: You want to have sex.
ZACH: Kind of.
LANE: Oh, my God! [She gets up and crosses the room.]
ZACH: You didn't know where this was heading?
LANE: How could I have known, Zach?
ZACH: I thought it was clear.
LANE: How, how?
ZACH: I cooked. I never cook.
LANE: I don't know that you've never cooked. I've known you, what, two years? This could be a dormant hobby.
ZACH: I lit candles.
LANE: I thought you were trying to save on electricity. Very prudent.
ZACH: I told you I wanted to have a special evening with you.
LANE: That's a clue?
ZACH [yelling]: I don't say crap like ‘special evening', Lane! I play guitar!
LANE: Okay! But –
ZACH: I lined the path to the bedroom door with rose petals? You had to have seen that.
LANE: I thought you tracked them in. You're always stepping in things, Zach.
ZACH: I don't know what else I could have done.
LANE: Yeah, well, neither do I.
ZACH: What?
LANE: You're right. You gave me, like, eighty-three clues, and I missed them all. I'm stupid.
ZACH: You're not. I was just trying to be subtle and that's not my thing. I'm bad, I'm a bad man.
LANE: You're not bad. You're good. I'm stupid.
ZACH: I pushed you. I should be arrested.
LANE: No, Zach. I should have known. We've been dating for what, four months? And we live together, and I'm twenty. You're a guy, and I'm a girl. Birds do it, bees do it.
ZACH: So, what do you think?
LANE: Oh, well, I have to wait until I get married.
ZACH: What?
LANE: I have to wait till I get married?
ZACH: I didn't know that.
LANE: Neither did I.
ZACH: Whoa.
LANE: Yeah, whoa.
ZACH: I don't know if I'm okay with that.
LANE: I'm not sure if I'm okay with that either.
[They look away. Lane gets up.]
ZACH: What are you doing?
LANE: Cleaning up.
ZACH: I'll do it.
LANE: No, Zach. You're not getting any tonight, the least I can do is clean up.
[Zach sits back down, confused.]
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE – KITCHEN
[Emily stomps into the kitchen, where she is making flower arrangements. Richard is calling after her.]
RICHARD: Emily, I don't believe we've finished talking about this. [He enters.] I think once you take a step back and think about this you will see that there is nothing to be upset about.
EMILY: I'm not upset, Richard. [She throws a flower into the vase.]
RICHARD: You're not.
EMILY: No, I'm not.
RICHARD: Oh, that flower just had it coming, I assume.
EMILY: You're loving this, aren't you?
RICHARD: Loving what?
EMILY: Rory won't even look at me, but it's ‘Grandpa, how was Greece?' and ‘Grandpa, I just love my gift'!
RICHARD: Oh, now, Emily.
EMILY: Lorelai won't take my calls, but runs to Daddy with her insurance problems.
RICHARD: Well, her insurance company's been robbing her blind!
EMILY: Please.
RICHARD: Well, would you like to see her policy? The deductible alone –
EMILY: You're the favorite and you're loving every single minute of it.
RICHARD: This is not a popularity contest.
EMILY: No, not a contest. You've already won.
RICHARD: Emily, you are acting incredibly immature!
EMILY: You couldn't wait to run over to that inn of hers for your secret clandestine meeting!
RICHARD: Well, how clandestine could it be? I just told you about it.
EMILY: I do not understand why you refuse to stand by me on this.
RICHARD: Why haven't we gotten stools in here?
EMILY: I did what I did for her own good!
RICHARD: Of course you did!
EMILY: I only want the best for her, and since she is incapable of judging what is right and what is wrong, I had to step in! I had to act!
RICHARD: Yes, you did. You acted and it backfired.
EMILY: Richard!
RICHARD: Well, you did! It was a noble effort, but it failed. And now we have to deal with the reality in front of us. However misguided Lorelai's feelings are right now, the fact is, she is not willing to deal with you. She will, however, deal with me. And at least this way we still have contact with her.
EMILY: Contact, please.
RICHARD: And hopefully, with time, we will be able to convince her to come back and things will return to normal. However, if we simply cut her off, no contact whatsoever, then the odds of being able to get things back to the status quo are not very good at all. Don't you agree? [Emily looks petulant.] I thought so. All right, now don't worry. [He kisses her forehead.] I have everything under control.
EMILY [as he is leaving]: Of course you do. Because you're the favorite.
STARS HOLLOW BOOKSTORE
[Rory is working. Lane is lying on the floor.]
LANE: I can't believe it. I just cannot believe it!
RORY: It's okay.
LANE: How did this happen? I started listening to rock music when I was seven years old. I snuck makeup on at school. I managed to join a band without anyone knowing. I had a boyfriend who my mother thought was a Christian guitarist. And I ate spicy condiments like they were going out of style.
RORY: Lane.
LANE: I drank soda, ate hamburgers, wore jewelry, I danced.
RORY: Not very well.
LANE: Hey, any k*ll level's a sin. And then I moved out and I lived with two guys. I mean, nothing else stuck. Nothing. So why this?
RORY: It's a mystery.
LANE: Why couldn't the gluten-free thing stick? I could've lived with that. Or the not dancing thing. Oh, you should have seen Zach's face, it was like
-
RORY: Like he realized he wasn't going to have sex with you until the wedding night.
LANE: Yes! Exactly. God, this blows!
RORY: A lot of people wait until they're married to have sex.
LANE: Yes. Jessica Simpson and Donna from 90210.
RORY: And a couple of others.
LANE: Oh, my God, what if I never get married?
RORY: You'll get married.
LANE: If I never get married then I'll never have sex.
RORY: You'll get married, you'll have sex.
LANE: That's easy for you to say. You've already had sex with two different guys. All within a one year period.
RORY: Okay, you're making me sound a little slutty.
LANE: Well, why shouldn't you be slutty? You have absolutely no mother-taught morals standing in the way of you and your sluttiness.
RORY: Oh. Well, when you put it that way.
LANE: Is it great?
RORY: Is what great?
LANE: Sex! Is it great?
RORY: Not in front of the books, Lane.
LANE: What am I saying? It's great. And I will never experience it because by the time I'm ready to get married all the men will have been taken by women who didn't grow up in my household!
[Lane puts on her coat.]
RORY: Going out to find a husband?
LANE: I have to get extra trash bags for the diner.
RORY: All right. Call me later.
[Lane exits the bookstore and starts walking down the street. She notices her mother up ahead, handing out flyers. She begins walking faster.]
LANE: You're in my head! Are you happy? You are in my head!
MRS. KIM: What?
[Bewildered, she watches Lane hurry away.]
STARS HOLLOW BOOKSTORE
[Rory is reading a book about Ernest Hemingway. She pulls her cell phone out of her pocket and dials. Scene cuts from Rory in the store to Logan, sitting in front of some trees.]
LOGAN: Hello?
RORY: We were both wrong.
LOGAN: About?
RORY: Hemingway's manuscripts were stolen in Hadley's suitcase at the Gare de Lyon.
LOGAN: Huh.
RORY: Yep. Just thought you should know. We're both dumb.
LOGAN: Guess we found each other.
RORY: Guess we did. So how's the outing in the woods going?
LOGAN: It was going fine until Finn decided to go through one of his naked phases.
RORY: Yikes.
LOGAN: Yeah. Suddenly the cabin seemed very small.
RORY: I bet.
LOGAN: Plus it got boring, and there's too many people there I know, so I decided to cut my skiing trip short.
RORY: Yeah? Where are you now?
LOGAN: Yale.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: Yep. Seems like I got the whole place to myself, too.
RORY: I bet. Everybody's gone for spring break.
LOGAN: You know it's nice like this. Very quiet. Lots of privacy. It's too bad you're not here.
RORY: And why is that?
LOGAN: I just think you'd like it.
RORY: Well, take me a picture.
LOGAN: You know if, by chance, you decided to cut your spring break short, you could be here with me to see it yourself.
RORY: Oh, really?
LOGAN: Just a suggestion, Ace.
RORY: Well, I'll think about it.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai picks a container of Chinese take-out from the coffee table.]
RORY [pulling her laundry bags]: So you're sure you're okay with this?
LORELAI: Oh, my God, for the fiftieth time, yes.
RORY: But I know you had the whole week planned out. I saw the DVD's.
LORELAI: Oh, hon.
RORY: Woman Under the Influence?
LORELAI: A.k.a. the story of me.
RORY: Soap marathon.
LORELAI: All can be done at a later time.
RORY: Okay. How about next weekend?
LORELAI: Mm, let me check my spinster catalogue. No, I'm going to be knitting toilet paper cozies till three. But after that I'm good.
RORY: Great, and we can do the Friday night Weston's dessert thing again next week.
LORELAI: Yeah, whatever you want.
RORY: Okay. You're sure you're not mad?
LORELAI: Oh, well, you'll never truly know until you read my memoir.
RORY: Oh, well.
LORELAI: Wait. [She gets up and opens a drawer.] So you'll always have clean underwear. [She hands her two rolls of quarters.]
RORY: Mom –
LORELAI: Take them.
RORY: Ah. Clean underwear, priceless.
LORELAI: And I'm going to cover the books you bought from Andrew.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: You're an enabler.
LORELAI: I know. You're my only daughter. That I know of.
RORY: Mom, thanks.
LORELAI: You're welcome. So, he came back early, huh?
RORY: Oh, yeah. Um, he said there just wasn't much to do up at the cabin, and it just got kind of cramped and gross with all those guys, so –
LORELAI: So, he came back early, huh?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI [giggles a little]: Bye.
RORY: Bye.
[Rory leaves. Lorelai turns on her movie, looking a little sad.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Kirk is the only customer. Luke is behind the counter.]
KIRK: Oh, my God, I love this stuff I think is meatloaf.
[Luke turns around and glares at him.]
KIRK: Sorry.
[Emily enters the diner. She stand by the door.[
EMILY: Hello, Luke.
[Luke stiffens, his back to Emily.]
EMILY: When you get a moment, I'd like to have a word with you.
LUKE: I'm busy right now.
EMILY: That's fine. I'll just wait here until things die down. [She pulls up a stool at the counter. Luke ignores her and makes some coffee. She opens the menu.] You have a wide selection here. [Pause.] What is mud pie?
KIRK: Oh, that's awesome. It's chocolate pie with Oreo cookie crust, and sometimes you can get Luke to put gummy worms in it, like worms in the mud, so, you can imagine.
EMILY [disgusted]: Well, you've painted a wonderful picture. [To Luke] Your coffeemaker seems to be full now.
LUKE [slamming the filter into the machine]: Coffee, Kirk?
KIRK: Oh, no. I can't drink coffee. It makes my lungs hurt. [Luke pours him a cup.] Thanks.
EMILY [to Kirk]: Would you mind excusing us?
KIRK: Oh, um, okay. [He gets up and takes his plate outside.]
EMILY: My daughter and I aren't speaking. She won't take my calls, she won't come to dinner. She apparently wants nothing to do with me. [Pause.] I'm sure you know that Lorelai and I have had many battles. Most of them have been because I feel that I know what's best for her. But Lorelai has her own ideas about what she thinks will make her happy. She wants you, Luke. She's made her choice, God help her, but there it is. It doesn't matter if I agree with it, I can't fight it. You've won. Go back to her. I promise I will stay out of it. [She gets up and heads toward the door. Kirk is pressed up against the glass.] You're going to have to clean that window. [She leaves. Luke stares at the door.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is watching a movie. Judy Garland is singing on the screen.]
JUDY: The night is bitter, the stars have lost their glitter. The winds grow colder, suddenly you're older, and all because of the man that got away.
[She hears someone knocking on the door. She opens the door and Luke walks in, wraps his arms around her and kisses her. Lorelai closes the door.]
JUDY: No more his eager call, the writing's on the wall, the dreams you've dreamed have all gone astray.

LUKE'S DINER
[Kirk is sitting at a table in the center, yelling loudly. There is a bin half filled with pink and blue ribbons in front of him.]
KIRK: Ribbons here! Return your ribbons here! That's right, folks! [A couple enters the diner and deposits their blue ribbons into the bin.] Thank you, sir. In the box, ma'am. Ribbons here, return your ribbons here!
LUKE: Kirk, stop that.
KIRK: Can't stop yet, Luke. Haven't got them all yet.
LUKE: I mean it, put the box away.
KIRK: Luke, you and Lorelai have reconciled.
LUKE: I know, Kirk. I was there.
KIRK: And since you two have reconciled, it's only appropriate that the citizens of Stars Hollow take off their pins and start to heal. In my case, literally. I caught about an inch of chest-flesh with this sharp little sucker.
LUKE: Kirk -
[Lulu walks past the diner. Kirk jumps out of his seat and yells at her through the window.]
KIRK: Lulu! Hey!
LULU: No, Kirk! I like my ribbon! It's pink! I like pink!
KIRK: This is bigger than your love of pink!
LULU [screams dramatically]: No!
[Lulu takes off down the street.]
KIRK: Lulu! Lulu, get back here! Lulu! [He leaves the diner to run after her. Lorelai enters.]
LORELAI: Wow, did you see that?
LUKE: You know, if someone opened a store in this town selling giant butterfly nets, they'd make a fortune.
LORELAI: Come on, the crazy need love too.
LUKE: Speaking of which - [they kiss] Welcome back.
LORELAI: Nice to be here.
LUKE: Want some coffee?
LORELAI: Oh, say that again, slower and with your pants off.
LUKE: What's that? [He gestures at the counter.]
LORELAI: My pretty, pretty face?
LUKE: That's a Weston's coffee cup.
LORELAI: Is it?
LUKE: You bring an enemy coffee cup in here on the day of our reconciliation.
LORELAI [with a mobster accent]: At least I didn't ask you for a favor on this, the day of our daughter's wedding.
LUKE: Get that coffee out of here.
LORELAI: This is not coffee. This is a mocha chocolate caramel swirl-a-chino with extra whip cream.
LUKE: That sounds disgusting.
LORELAI: It is. And if it was physically possible to make love to a hot beverage, this would be the one.
LUKE: So apparently I've got competition.
LORELAI: No, no, no. It's just a fling. I'll finally spend the night with it, but then when I see it in the morning with the caramel un-swirled and the whip cream un-whipped, huh! Buh-bye.
[Kirk opens the door, panting. He is holding Lulu's sweater, complete with its pink ribbon.]
KIRK: Man, that was hard. [Pause.] She must have stretched first. [He tosses the sweater into the bin.]
OPENING CREDITS
YALE CAMPUS
[Evening. Rory and Logan are walking together. Logan has his arm around Rory's waist.]
RORY: So, judging from the snoring I'm guessing you love the theater.
LOGAN: That was not a snore. That was a groan.
RORY: It was not a painful play.
LOGAN: Any play is a painful play for me.
RORY: Well, that's too bad, because you're going to miss out on some wonderful things.
LOGAN: Yeah, like what?
RORY [smiling]: My mom took me to see Caroline, or Change in New York, Tony Kushner's musical, and it was the most amazing thing we ever saw. Tony Kushner wrote Angels in America.
LOGAN: I know who Tony Kushner is.
RORY: So you've seen his plays?
LOGAN: No, my mom plays Canasta with him every month he's in town.
RORY: Tony Kushner plays Canasta with your mother?
LOGAN: Badly, but yes.
RORY: You have a magical life, Huntzberger! And you don't even know it.
LOGAN: So, where to next?
RORY: Oh, I don't know. Mah Jongg with Mamet?
LOGAN: How does ice cream sound?
RORY: Ice cream sounds great.
LOGAN: Then ice cream it is. [He takes her hand and pulls her toward one of the buildings.]
RORY: Whoa, Logan! Where are we going? Slow down.
LOGAN: Slow down and you die, Ace.
RORY: Yeah, you go too fast in heels and you kind of die also.
[He pulls her into a dark doorway, which he opens with a key.]
YALE CAMPUS - DINING HALL
[It is dark. Rory and Logan enter.]
RORY: What are we doing?
LOGAN: We're getting ice cream.
RORY: But the dining hall's closed. We're breaking in.
LOGAN: That's a very negative way of looking at it.
RORY: How do you have a key to the dining hall?
LOGAN: I know a lot of very powerful locksmiths.
RORY: Well, what happens if we get caught? Could we get suspended? They can't kick you out of school for this, can they?
LOGAN: Hey, relax. Look around. For tonight this is all yours.
RORY: It is kind of cool.
LOGAN: Wait till you see the kitchen.
RORY: Whoa! Oh, I've never seen the cereal completely full before. I'm never here early enough! I knew they had Cocoa Puffs.
LOGAN: Go crazy, Ace.
RORY: No, we're getting ice cream.
LOGAN: There's no rule that says you can't have ice cream and cereal. Go on, get your Cocoa Puffs.
RORY [reaches for a bowl]: First Cocoa Puffs of the day. This is a historic moment.
LOGAN: Okay. Next stop, ice cream.
RORY: Mm.
LOGAN: What are you doing?
RORY: I'm looking for the swipe machine so I can deduct points from my meal plan.
LOGAN: You're kidding, right?
RORY: Well, the school pays for the food.
LOGAN: Trust me. With all the money my family has donated to this school, they can afford to be out of a few Cocoa Puffs. Let's go.
RORY: This is fun.
LOGAN: You're an easy girl to please. [They kiss.] Let's hit the kitchen.
RORY: 'Kay.
[They walk toward the kitchen. Almost at the door, Rory turns back and leaves a dollar at the cereal station.]
LOGAN: Ace, come on!
RORY: I'm coming!
[They exit.]
DRAGONFLY INN
[Lorelai is walking around, giving orders.]
LORELAI [to a maid dusting]: Oh, okay, thanks. That's enough there. Just make sure you get the stairs now. [To two men carrying flowers] Oh, no, those go outside. Anacencia will take care of you.
[She enters the living room and sees Sookie.]
LORELAI: Oh, what a surprise! A plate of cookies on the coffee table to match the basket of cupcakes on the reception desk.
SOOKIE: What? I always do this.
LORELAI: Oh, you always do this when a photographer from American Travel magazine is coming to photograph us for -
SOOKIE and LORELAI [in unison]: One of the Top Ten Inns in Connecticut!
SOOKIE [squeals]: I have no idea what you're talking about.
LORELAI: You know, I moved the furniture in the bedrooms around four times last night.
SOOKIE: And you ended up?
LORELAI: With everything in exactly the same place I started with.
[Sookie giggles.]
LORELAI: Oh, the dining room looks beautiful.
SOOKIE: Thank you.
LORELAI: And, what a surprise, a cake on every table.
SOOKIE: So no one has to share.
[They walk into the library.]
LORELAI: Okay, floor looks good, table looks good. Hey, what happened to our books?
SOOKIE: What do you mean?
LORELAI: All our beautiful, leather-bound books. Jonathon Swift, Edith Wharton, Charles Dickens. A lot of them are gone.
SOOKIE: The guests must have swiped 'em.
LORELAI: They swiped Jonathon Swift and left me with Clifford, the Big Red Dog and five copies of He's Just Not That Into You.
SOOKIE: We've been airplane booked.
LORELAI: Oh, we've got to get them out of here. Hey Eddie? [Eddie comes in.]
Will you get these out of here? [He takes them from her and leaves.] I'll raid Rory's leftovers tonight.
[Michel enters, wearing sunglasses, a t-shirt featuring a palm tree, and carrying two paper bags.]
MICHEL: Well, there everybody is. Who missed Michel?
LORELAI: Huh. Trick question?
SOOKIE: How was California?
MICHEL: Ah, you know, it is insanity. What is different about me?
SOOKIE: You're wearing sunglasses inside?
MICHEL: They're not sunglasses. They are eyewear. Everyone in Los Angeles wears pairs and pairs of eyewear.
LORELAI: Well, you look great.
MICHEL: Oh, I tell you, I belong out there. Everybody is thin and gorgeous. Oh, there is this place on Sunset Boulevard, a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, and everybody there talks exactly like me.
LORELAI: Wow.
MICHEL: I got Botox.
SOOKIE: Ow.
MICHEL: Dr. Wu, oh, she's a genius. Everyone goes there. And look. [He shows them his teeth.] I got them done by the same guy who does Nick Lachey. Okay, gather around. I brought gifts. [He holds up his bags.]
LORELAI: Gifts, great!
MICHEL: Oh, the shopping out there, unbelievable. Rodeo Drive, dig a hole and drop me in, even if I'm not dead yet. Okay, for you and for you. [He hands them their bags.]
LORELAI [pulling out her gift]: Huh.
MICHEL: It's a smog globe. [Laughs] They are so funny in California.
SOOKIE [opening her gift]: Well, what do you know. [giggles a little] He's Just Not That Into You.
MICHEL: I heard it's a fabulous book, and so true. Oh, I haven't told you the most amazing part yet.
LORELAI: You got your boobs done by the same guy who did Pamela Anderson?
MICHEL: No, though I did meet him at the Coffee Bean. I was at this place called the Farmer's Market, and I was just sitting there, minding anybody's business, and a man came up to me and asked if I would like to be a contestant on the Price is Right!
LORELAI: You're kidding!
MICHEL: I was so stunned! I mean, I never considered being on a game show, but I was finished with my Bubble Tea, so I figured, why not?
SOOKIE: They just asked you to be on.
MICHEL: Yes.
SOOKIE: Boy, that's weird. Jackson's cousin Monty did the Price is Right, and he told us that the contestants had to get up at the crack of dawn, sit in line for hours, with hundreds of tourists, and then show how enthusiastic of a contestant they would be. You know, jumping up and down, screaming and yelling.
MICHEL: You don't say.
SOOKIE: Yeah. And they had to wear embarrassing t-shirts that said things like 'Pick Me, Bob! I neutered my dog!' And they spent weeks studying the price of Turtle wax and Hamburger Helper.
MICHEL: Okay, fine! I may have jumped a little, but I did not wear a t-shirt.
LORELAI: Michel. What would Nick Lachey's teeth guy say?
MICHEL: Make fun if you want, but I walked away the winner of over a hundred thousand dollar of cash and prizes!
LORELAI: Then what's with the cheap gifts?
SOOKIE: That's not even that smoggy.
MICHEL [getting up, muttering to himself]: Why do I talk to you? Why?
LORELAI: All right. I'm going to go run over to Luke's and grab some dinner, and then I will be back to finish the setup.
SOOKIE: Got it.
LUKE'S DINER
[A woman rushes out of the bathroom. Kirk follows her.]
KIRK: Well, if you'd just put it in the box like I told you to, I wouldn't have had to follow you in. [He sets a pink ribbon into the box.]
LUKE [to Lorelai]: Here's your fries.
LORELAI: Mm, good.
LUKE: Where's your burger?
LORELAI: I ate it.
LUKE: I was gone two seconds.
LORELAI: Ketchup, please?
LUKE: By the time I get the ketchup, the fries'll be gone.
LORELAI: You're right, forget the ketchup.
LUKE: Slow down!
LORELAI: I can't slow down. I only have fifteen minutes before I have to get back to the inn.
LUKE: You're going to make yourself sick.
LORELAI: Yes, but my sickness will remind me of you, so it'll be romantic.
LUKE: Romantic nausea.
KIRK: I get that all the time.
LORELAI: Hit me with the pie.
LUKE: What pie?
LORELAI: The boysenberry pie.
LUKE: We're out of boysenberry pie.
LORELAI: How can you be out of boysenberry pie?
LUKE: Because someone ordered the last piece.
LORELAI: But I specifically asked you to save me a piece of boysenberry pie.
LUKE: Uh, no you didn't.
LORELAI: Uh, yes I did.
LUKE: When?
LORELAI: I left you a message.
LUKE: I never got a message.
LORELAI: I left it on your cell phone.
LUKE: Oh, is that what that annoying beeping sound was?
LORELAI: Yes. It was telling you that your girlfriend called and asked you to save her some pie.
LUKE: Well, I don't know how to use the voicemail.
LORELAI [laughs]: You don't?
LUKE: Or anything else on this stupid thing. I know how to make a call and answer a call and then I'm out.
LORELAI: Give me that. You have got to learn how to use this thing because it is very powerful and wonderful, and it will change your life.
LUKE: What are you doing?
LORELAI: I am putting my number on speed-dial, so all you have to do is press one, see, like 'I'm number one' [she raises one hand in the air like a cheerleader] and then - [her cell phone rings in her purse] - oh, I wonder who that could be? [She pulls it out and answers it.] Hello?
LUKE: Give me. [He takes his phone back from Lorelai and talks to her on it.] No cell phones in the diner.
[They hang up their cell phones.]
LORELAI: Oh, see, wasn't that fun?
LUKE: Totally.
LORELAI: Want me to put it on vibrate for you?
LUKE: Fifteen minutes are up.
LORELAI: Oh, crap, I got to go.
LUKE: Take a donut.
LORELAI: So then Sunday?
LUKE: Pick you up at eight.
LORELAI: I'll leave you a message letting you know your chances of getting lucky.
[Luke rolls his eyes.]
LORELAI: Hey, Kirk, how's the ribbon collecting coming?
LUKE: Oh, why do you get him started?
KIRK: I think we're near the finish line.
LORELAI: Who's winning?
LUKE: Hey, this isn't a contest.
LORELAI: I just want to know.
LUKE: I don't care who's winning.
LORELAI: Well, then you won't care if it's me.
LUKE [coming around the counter]: Well, of course it's you. You're the one who makes the costumes for the Christmas pageant. You make the ornaments for the Firelight Festival. You go to the town meetings. You say hello to people. You have a daughter that looks like she belongs on top of a Christmas tree. Everybody knows that gets you tons of points.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: There's no way to compete with that.
LORELAI: Kirk?
KIRK: You're kicking his ass.
LORELAI: Yes!
LUKE: This isn't a contest.
LORELAI: No, not now, it isn't. Kirk, I want a final tally, because the ribbon loser is buying the ribbon winner dinner Sunday night.
LUKE: Loser pays? When did we agree on that?
LORELAI: Oh, gee, I must have left that on your voicemail too.
[She leaves. Luke looks at Kirk.]
RORY'S CAR
[Evening. Rory is driving. Her cell phone rings, she answers it.]
RORY: Hey Mom.
[Scene cuts to Star's Hollow street where Lorelai is walking, carrying a bag from Luke's.]
LORELAI: Hey. How would you feel about doing a little shopping tomorrow?
RORY: Hurt. Confused. A little dirty.
LORELAI: I need to get a new getting-back-together-with-Luke dress for my back-together-with-Luke date.
RORY: Oh, where do you want to go?
LORELAI: How about the new place where you got the scarf with the bows on it?
RORY: Oh, yes, cute place.
LORELAI: I want to go to the cute place.
RORY: Ten o'clock?
LORELAI: I'll be the one holding coffee. So, uh, what are you doing tonight?
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: What? Are you driving? Sounds like you're driving.
RORY: I am driving.
LORELAI: You are? Where are you going?
RORY: You know where I'm going, Mom.
LORELAI: Disneyland?
RORY: Nope.
LORELAI: Puppy world?
RORY: You're so immature. You're going to make me say it?
LORELAI: Say what?
RORY [sighs]: I am on my way to Friday night dinner.
LORELAI: Ah-ha-ha! That's right. You're on the road to Hellville.
RORY: Do not gloat.
LORELAI: I'm not gloating. I'm gloating with hand gestures.
RORY: Bye.
LORELAI: And a little soft shoe.
RORY: Got to go.
LORELAI: Listen, enjoy your glazed woodcock with a side of truffled goose head.
RORY: Oh, what a shame, I'm here.
LORELAI: You are not.
RORY: See you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Oh, Rory, wait. I'm gloating with jazz hands.
RORY: Bye, Mom.
[She hangs up.]
LUKE'S DINER
[The diner is nearly dark. Kirk is the last customer.]
LUKE: Finish up, Kirk. I'm closing up early.
KIRK: You're going to see Lorelai tonight, aren't you?
LUKE: Actually no, she's working. I'm going to see her Sunday night.
KIRK: That sounds nice. You guys probably spend a lot of time together.
LUKE: Yes, we do.
KIRK: And you probably sleep over at each other's houses, too.
LUKE [coming over to his table]: Cookies are on the house, Kirk. Just go, okay?
KIRK: You know, Lulu's my first real girlfriend. I had an imaginary girlfriend for a while when I was young, but she left me.
LUKE: Well, that happens.
[Luke picks up the chair opposite Kirk to put it up on the table.]
KIRK: I wish Lulu and I could have what you and Lorelai have.
LUKE: Oh, you can have that, Kirk. You will have that. In fact, why don't you leave, and go have it right now?
KIRK: You know, I live with my mother.
LUKE [muttering to himself]: Apparently I'm officially in this conversation, don't know how it happened, but -
[Luke puts the chair back on the floor and sits on it.]
KIRK: My mother is allergic to Lulu. The minute Lulu comes in the room, my mother will cough and choke and turn red. Her throat closes up, everything gets puffy. Lulu's tried everything. She changed her soap, her perfume, shampoo, cream rinse, deodorant. She's actually kind of a mess right now. But nothing seems to work.
LUKE: Kirk -
KIRK: Obviously I can't have Mother choking three times a week, so I considered constructing a separate entrance to my room, so that Lulu won't actually have to walk through the house, but that's going to cost about forty thousand dollars, 'cause I'd have to break through a bearing wall, and
-
LUKE: Kirk, stop! This is ridiculous. You're a grown man. You have got to change your living situation.
KIRK: My mother won't move out. I've asked.
LUKE: I'm not talking about your mother. I'm talking about you.
KIRK: Me?
LUKE: Yes, you. Get a life. Get some independence. Get out of there.
KIRK: But -
LUKE: You want to have a real relationship with Lulu?
KIRK: Yes.
LUKE: Then grow up. Be a man.
KIRK: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying to me.
LUKE [getting up]: Well, Kirk, I have given you the Lincoln logs, and you have to build the cabin. [He shuts off the light.] Lock the door behind you.
[Luke heads upstairs.]
KIRK: You're not talking about a real cabin, are you? 'Cause if a new entrance is going to cost forty grand, then a cabin has got to be more.
LUKE [from upstairs]: Good night, Kirk!
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE
[The doorbell rings. Richard rushes toward the door.]
RICHARD: Emily! They're here! Hurry, please!
[He opens the door. Rory is holding a large duffel bag full of papers.]
RICHARD: My goodness! The bag is bigger than you are.
RORY: I brought you some recent issues of the Yale Daily News. We've been doing some really good articles lately.
RICHARD: And some with a by-line I might be familiar with, I hope?
RORY: I believe that, yes, you'll find some highlighted sections in your hymnals.
RICHARD: Then hand the bag over, my dear.
RORY: 'Kay.
[She kisses his cheek.]
EMILY: Sorry to keep everybody waiting.
RICHARD: Uh, luckily we had plenty to read. [He shows her the bag.]
EMILY: Hello, Rory.
RORY: Hello, Grandma.
EMILY: Let's go in the living room, shall we?
RICHARD: Excellent idea.
OLYMPIA: Pardon me, Mrs. Gilmore. Shall I put the salads out now, ma'am?
EMILY: We haven't had drinks yet, Olympia.
OLYMPIA: Yes, ma'am.
EMILY: I wrote it all down on the refrigerator pad for you, Olympia.
RORY: Is someone else coming for dinner?
RICHARD: Someone else? No. It's just going to be us.
RORY: Us, meaning just the three of us here, right? I mean, you know Mom's not coming.
[Richard and Emily exchange a look.]
RICHARD: Oh. Well, actually -
EMILY: Of course we knew your mother's not coming. The maid made a mistake. Olympia, it was three for dinner, not four. Well, she's fired. Clear that place at once, please. Richard, take Rory in the living room. I'll just do it myself.
RICHARD: All right.
[Rory and Richard go into the living room. Emily shoo's the maid away from the dining table. She reaches for the plate, then stops, clearly hurt. She braces herself against the chair.]
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE
[Later.]
EMILY: Now, I had Olympia write out the reheating instructions for the goose. And they work. I had her test it during dessert.
RORY: Thank you, Grandma.
EMILY: I also put some Perry and David fruit in there.
RICHARD: Oh, you can eat the pears with a spoon.
RORY: I'll remember that. Bye, Grandpa. Bye, Grandma.
RICHARD: Bye, bye.
EMILY: Bye, Rory.
[She closes the door.]
RICHARD: Well, that was a pleasant evening.
EMILY: Really? What dinner were you at?
RICHARD: Well, we weren't exactly sure she was coming, Emily.
EMILY: I was sure. I don't understand it. Why wasn't she here?
[Emily begins to pour herself a drink.]
RICHARD: Well, I'm guessing she had something to do.
EMILY: Something to do? What does that mean, something to do?
[Richard takes over making drinks, while Emily sits down.]
RICHARD: It means she had a previous engagement or meeting. A dinner, perhaps.
EMILY: I know what something to do means, Richard.
RICHARD: My apologies, Emily.
EMILY: It doesn't make any sense at all. I went down there. I arranged the whole thing. She got her filthy diner owner back. What is the problem?
RICHARD: I don't know! Lorelai is as much of a mystery to me as she is to you.
EMILY: I made a whole goose for three people. Wasteful.
RICHARD [thoughtfully]: Do you think it's possible that they didn't get back together?
EMILY: What?
RICHARD: Perhaps it didn't happen. Maybe he didn't understand what you were telling him to do.
EMILY: How could he not understand? I spelled it out for him, step by step. I spoke clearly and slowly. There is no way he didn't understand what I was telling him to do.
RICHARD: All right. Then perhaps he understood, but he simply didn't do it? He's not the most take-charge sort of fellow, you know. He never did follow through on my advice to franchise his diner.
EMILY: Oh, my God, you're right. He didn't do it. He didn't go to her like I specifically told him to.
RICHARD: So it would seem.
EMILY: What an imbecile that man is!
RICHARD: Well, you gave it your best effort. No one can say you didn't.
EMILY: I just don't believe it.
RICHARD: Don't worry, Emily. I'm sure she'll come around eventually. And then, at least, we won't have to deal with them as a couple. [Emily looks sadly into her empty glass.] Here, let me freshen up your drink.
CLOTHING SHOP
[Rory and Lorelai exit and begin walking down the street.]
RORY: If I still want that sweater in twenty minutes I'm coming back to get it.
LORELAI: Okay, wait. What is wrong with this picture?
RORY: Huh?
LORELAI: You - look at you. An armful of bags and a potential twenty-minute sweater on the way, and look at me. Completely bagless.
RORY: Relax, the day's still young.
LORELAI: There are no more clothes out there for me. The Lorelai look is over. I wish someone had told me.
RORY: That would've helped.
[A lady walks by.]
LORELAI: Oh, see? That's what I want. Hey, come on. Let's follow her.
RORY: I'm not following that girl.
LORELAI: But she knows where my stores are and she looks about my size, so if she happens to have an aneurysm between now and tomorrow night - what?
[Rory is looking across the street. Lorelai looks and sees Logan sitting at an outdoor cafe with another girl. They look very cozy.]
LORELAI: My God. Is that Logan? It is Logan. I can't believe it. What a jerk.
RORY: Mom, it's okay.
LORELAI: No, it's not okay! He's sitting over there with a girl and - oh, no you don't. Get me a rock.
RORY: Mom -
LORELAI: I am beaning him with a rock!
RORY: Mom! Stop, it's fine!
LORELAI: How is it fine? I'm sorry, aren't you still seeing him?
RORY: Well, yeah.
LORELAI: Okay, so if you're still seeing him and he's over there seeing her, how is that okay?
RORY: Because. We're keeping things casual.
LORELAI: Casual?
RORY: We see each other, we see other people, and that's him over there, seeing other people. So it's fine.
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: We both agreed.
LORELAI: Okay. You both agreed, then, okay. But, aren't you guys sleeping together?
RORY: Mom. It's college.
LORELAI [frowning]: Oh, right. It's college.
RORY: We're both busy. We have class, we have friends. You know, it's good to just keep things cas, have fun. That's it.
LORELAI: Fun. Sure. I get it. Friends with benefits. No problem, I watch Oprah. [She sighs.] Okay, so. Are you sure you're cool with this?
RORY: I'm completely cool with this.
LORELAI: 'Kay. 'Cause it just really bothers -
RORY [cutting her off]: Mom, look over there! I think the Lorelai look is back, and it's in velvet!
[Rory keeps walking down the street. Lorelai follows, staring at Logan.]
DRAGONFLY INN
[Lorelai is showing the photographer around.]
LORELAI: So, Hal, what do you think? Living room, reception area might be a nice place to start.
HAL: I really need to sh**t the exteriors first. We're about to lose the light.
LORELAI: Oh, great idea. Well, let me tell you, we are very proud of our exteriors. Why don't I get Michel to show you outside and help you set up?
HAL: Okay.
[Lorelai leaves Hal at the door and walks to the reception desk.]
MICHEL [On the phone]: No, no. This is unacceptable. Put your supervisor on the phone. Now, now, right now!
LORELAI: Hey, everything okay, Michel?
MICHEL: Yes, everything is fine. Lots of sunshine. I'll be right with you. [On the phone.] I insist you do something about this before I go out and find a stick and make it pointy and come and find your cubicle and poke you very hard!
LORELAI [walking back to the door]: Hey, tell you what. Why don't I just show you outside myself?
HAL: Okay.
MICHEL: Sure, I'll hold.
[They go outside.]
YALE NEWSPAPER OFFICE
[Rory is typing at her desk. Logan comes in.]
LOGAN: Now, that's a look of great determination.
RORY: Yes, I'm determined to finish this piece before my caffeine buzz wears off and I have about thirty seconds left.
[Logan sits down on the corner of the desk.]
LOGAN: So.
RORY: So.
LOGAN: Did I see you on State Street with...
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: Right. So you saw me on State Street with...
RORY: Yep.
LOGAN: So.
RORY: So.
LOGAN: Are we still good?
RORY: Absolutely.
LOGAN: Really?
RORY: Logan, we both agreed. No strings attached. Remember?
LOGAN: I remember. I was just checking to see how well you remember.
RORY: I remember perfectly.
LOGAN: Okay, that's good to hear. So -
RORY: Oh, we're not going to do the 'so' thing again, are we?
LOGAN: No, promise. No more so's. Would you take an 'um'?
RORY: Depends. Where's it leading?
LOGAN: Um, are you busy, or do you feel like grabbing a cup of coffee?
RORY: Why, do you have a master key to a Starbuck's or something?
LOGAN: Nah, just thought we'd walk in and pay.
RORY: Wow. Old school. Sure, let's go.
LOGAN: Okay, let's go.
[Logan walks out. Rory gets up and follows.]
DRAGONFLY INN
[Outside. They are getting ready for the photo sh**t.]
LORELAI: Yeah, there. Right there. How's it looking, Hal?
HAL: I think we're good with the flowers. Let's start clearing everyone out of there.
[Lorelai walks toward the porch. Sookie comes out and places a platter of food on the porch railing.]
SOOKIE: How's it going?
LORELAI: I think we're getting ready to sh**t. What are you doing?
SOOKIE: Well, just in case he doesn't have time to do the sh*t of the kitchen, people will get to see the food.
LORELAI: You're insane. [Calling to Hal] Okay, we're ready!
[Michel rushes out the front door, yelling into his cell phone.]
MICHEL: Okay, try something else! I don't care, just stop it! Block it with your body! Tien an Men Square! Be a hero!
LORELAI: Uh, Michel, what's wrong?
MICHEL: I will tell you what's wrong. Ned the bellman is wrong. He's useless! I gave him specific instructions and he ignored them!
LORELAI: What the hell is that?
[A gigantic motor home drives around the corner.]
MICHEL: No, no, no! Do not drive that here! It was not supposed to arrive for two more days.
LORELAI: Seriously, what is that?
MICHEL: My ‘over one hundred thousand dollar in cash and prizes'.
LORELAI: That's what you won?
MICHEL: That, and many boxes of some sort of instant rice dish that I have yet to feel the need to sample.
[The motor home parks directly in front of the front door. A man gets out.]
MAN: Are you Michel Girard?
MICHEL: Yes.
MAN: Well, Michel Gerard, I am pleased to present you with your motor home. Step on inside and I'll show you how everything works.
MICHEL: I don't want to know how it works. I don't want it here at all.
LORELAI: Michel, I don't understand.
MICHEL: After I won this monstrosity, I told them I did not want it. I wanted the cash. But they said they would only give me half of what it was worth!
SOOKIE: Yeah! Jackson's cousin won a washer and dryer on the twenty five thousand dollar Pyramid, but he decided to take half the cash value ‘cause he likes to go to the Laundromat to pick up women.
MICHEL: Well, I am not Jackson's cousin. I have all of my chromosomes, and I don't want half of the cash value. I want the entire hundred thousand dollars that was flashing under my face.
MAN: Excuse me. Do you want to know how to use it or not? ‘Cause the leveling can be a little tricky.
MICHEL: No, I do not want to know how to use it!
MAN: Okay. [He hands him the key.] Enjoy your day.
MICHEL: Drop dead and we'll discuss it. They told me I had a week before they were delivering it. I put an ad online and I was going to sell it. And then I get a call that it is coming and it has not been a week!
LORELAI: Oh, wait, sir? Could I, uh, pay you to just take this away for an hour? You know, drive it around, show it the sights?
MAN: Sorry. Once we deliver the keys, it's out of our hands.
HAL: Uh, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Taking care of it, Hal.
HAL: By the time all this dust clears, I'm afraid we'll have lost the light anyway.
LORELAI: No, no, we're not losing the light. We'll keep the light, lose the dust. Sookie, get the dust busters? Michel, move this thing.
SOOKIE: Squawk at the roast?
LORELAI: Michel!
MICHEL: I don't know how it works!
LORELAI: Figure it out!
MICHEL: You figure it out! It's like the space shuttle in here.
HAL: Okay. We're done here.
LORELAI: What? No!
HAL: It's too late. I can take some interior shots just for the hell of it.
LORELAI: Oh, sure. Sookie, why don't you show him the kitchen?
SOOKIE: Really? Great. Follow me.
[Sookie and Hal go inside.]
LORELAI: You know, I can't believe it. I can't believe you had your motor home delivered here, to the inn, today!
MICHEL: I was supposed to have a week!
LORELAI: You know, Michel, I know the world revolves around you and we all have to understand that, but this was important.
MICHEL: I didn't think it was coming today.
LORELAI: You didn't think, period. You know, I don't always expect you to be a great help around here, but how about not being a super colossal hindrance to us all, okay!
[She stomps into the inn, leaving Michel with nothing but hurt feelings and his motor home.]
YALE DINING HALL
[Rory is sitting in a big couch, reading. Robert approaches her.]
ROBERT: Business or pleasure?
[Rory looks up, smiles, and show him the book she is reading.]
ROBERT: Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and peasant and the making of the modern world. Oh. Pleasure.
RORY: Have you read it?
ROBERT: I'm waiting for the film to come out.
RORY: Yeah, I heard Renee Zellweger is gaining a ton of weight to play the peasant.
ROBERT: Listen, I was wondering if you're doing anything tomorrow night.
RORY: Oh. Um, I don't know. Why?
ROBERT: Well, it's Finn's birthday. He's having a party. Lots of booze, no food whatsoever.
RORY: Ah, that Finn.
ROBERT: I was wondering if you'd like to go.
RORY: With you?
ROBERT: Well, that was the plan, yes.
RORY: Oh. [Thinks for a moment] Well, um, sure.
ROBERT: Yes?
RORY: Yes. I'd love to. Um, let's celebrate another year of Finn.
ROBERT: Excellent. Now, it's themed. Anything Quentin Tarantino is acceptable, and I'll pick you up at your room around nine.
RORY: Sounds good.
ROBERT: Does it? Well, how about that.
[He leaves. Rory has a smug look on her face, proud of her ‘casual dating'.]
DRAGONFLY INN – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai walks in.]
LORELAI: Hey, Sookie, have you seen Michel? He was arranging a car to take the Martins to Foxwoods.
SOOKIE: I think he's showing some people the motor home.
LORELAI: Now?
SOOKIE: He asked me if it was okay. I told him it was okay. Is it okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, it's okay, but why didn't he just ask me?
SOOKIE: I think he's a little afraid of you.
LORELAI: Afraid of me? Of kitten? Was I really that mean?
SOOKIE: You were upset.
LORELAI: I was mean.
SOOKIE: You know Michel. He likes to dish it out, but he's extremely sensitive if you give it back.
LORELAI: Yeah. I guess.
SOOKIE: You can't even tease him. He never wore those red cowboy boots again.
LORELAI [cringes]: I remember.
SOOKIE: I'm sure he'll get over it. You know Michel.
LORELAI: Yeah. Hey, could you ask Eddie to get the Martins a car?
SOOKIE [nods]: You got it.
[Lorelai heads outside.]
DRAGONFLY INN – OUTSIDE
[Michel is walking around the motor home, followed by five or six people.]
MAN: What's the gas mileage like?
MICHEL: Hmm?
MAN: The gas mileage?
MICHEL: It's five thousand pounds of metal on wheels. I'm sure the mileage is fabulous.
MAN: Would you take twenty for it?
MICHEL: Twenty? But it's brand new, and – oh, whatever. Twenty, sure. You got a cheque?
LORELAI: Oh, whoa, whoa! [Sales voice.] Hi. What Michel means to say is that he would happily entertain all offers for this top-of-the-line streamlined beautiful motor home. I mean, look at it! I just may buy it myself.
MICHEL: What are you talking about?
WOMAN [to her husband]: Offer thirty.
LORELAI: Hey, has everyone seen inside this baby? ‘Cause if you haven't, you need to. Seriously. [She lures them inside the motor home.] And while you're taking a look, please note the plush soil and stain resistant wall-to-wall wallpaper, that acts as the beautiful maple-ish paneling. Huh? Yeah.
[The last viewer steps inside.]
LORELAI [to Michel]: Twenty grand? You're just giving this thing away.
MICHEL: That's what I was told to do. I didn't know about the maple-ish paneling.
LORELAI: Michel, you can't sell this thing for twenty thousand dollars. What are you thinking?
MICHEL: Apparently I'm not. Apparently I never think. [He turns away.]
LORELAI: Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
MICHEL: Whatever.
LORELAI: Michel, I was just tense about the photo sh**t and I said things I shouldn't have said. You know I didn't mean them, right?
MICHEL: I do not know that at all.
LORELAI: I think you do. I think you know this inn could not run without you. And I think you know I know this inn could not run without you.
MICHEL: What about your photo sh**t? I ruined it for you, no?
LORELAI: We rescheduled the photo sh**t. Everything's fine.
MICHEL: I could have told you they'd reschedule. Everything with you is so dramatic.
LORELAI [smiles]: So what are we going to do here?
MICHEL: Oh, well, I just want the thing gone.
LORELAI: Michel, you had one hundred thousand dollars flash in front of your face and the entire world saw it. Now come on, go get your money.
MICHEL: Well –
LORELAI: Seriously, Michel, the, uh, rube with the crossed eyes and the bolo tie, I say that's your man.
MICHEL: He does look stupid, doesn't he?
LORELAI: Yeah. And familiar with the, uh, ways of hooking up things to local sewer lines. Huh? Go get ‘em!
MICHEL: Yes, I'll zero in on him. Worse comes to worst, the woman with the elastic waist jeans should be a nice backup.
LORELAI: Attaboy.
MICHEL: You know, if I hold out, maybe I can get a hundred and twenty thousand instead of –
LORELAI: Just sell the thing!
MICHEL: Right.



LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai stands in front of the mirror, wearing a slinky dress and looking rather unhappy. She picks up the phone. Scene cuts between here and Rory's dorm, where she is also getting ready for the evening.]
RORY: Well?
LORELAI: It's too sparkly.
RORY: It's not too sparkly.
LORELAI: I look like a chandelier.
RORY: What shoes are you wearing?
LORELAI: The pink pumps.
RORY: I like those.
LORELAI: Are they a little too ‘Come and get it'?
RORY: Don't you want him to come and get it?
LORELAI: Uh, yes, but I want it to be his idea to come and get it. It's not the same if the shoes tell him to ‘Come and get it'.
RORY: I really, really want to stop saying ‘Come and get it'.
LORELAI: Fine.
RORY: I have to get ready.
LORELAI: Going out?
RORY: As a matter of fact, I have a date tonight.
LORELAI: Logan?
RORY: No, Robert.
LORELAI: Who's Robert?
RORY: He's a friend.
LORELAI: Have I met this Robert?
RORY: No, you have not met this Robert.
LORELAI: What's his last name?
RORY: Why? Do you think I'm making him up?
LORELAI: I just wondered if I ever heard you mention him before.
RORY: Um, he's just a guy I know at Yale, and there's a party tonight for another guy I know at Yale, and Robert [Pause] Grimmaldi asked me to go, so I am going to go.
LORELAI: So, does this mean it's over with Logan?
RORY: Nope. It just means that tonight I'm going out with Robert.
LORELAI [confused]: And you like this Robert, right?
RORY: Right. You know. The party's a Quentin Tarantino themed party, and you have to wear a costume, so I'm going as Gogo.
LORELAI: ‘Cause you have the skirt.
RORY: And no other ideas.
LORELAI: Cluelessness is the mother of invention. Call me after.
RORY: I will do that.
LORELAI: Oh, this dress is too slutty.
RORY: The dress is fine. The person in it, however –
LORELAI [gasps]: You're breaking up, the, the house is going through a tunnel. You're breaking up, I – [She makes a crinkling sound with her throat, then hangs up.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LATER
[Luke gets out of his truck. He walks half way up the sidewalk, but Lorelai exits the house and meets him there.]
LUKE: Oh, I was just gonna –
LORELAI: I just heard the car, so I –
LUKE [points at the house]: No, but I always –
LORELAI: I know. Yeah, I know.
LUKE: No, I should've.
[There is an awkward pause. They are smiling at each other.]
LORELAI: ‘Kay, this is stupid.
LUKE: Yes, it is.
LORELAI: It's not like we've never done this before.
LUKE: We have.
LORELAI: And successfully.
LUKE: I've made it to the door.
LORELAI: I've made it to the car.
[They both take a deep breath, still smiling.]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
[He puts his arm around her and they walk to the truck. Lorelai gets in, Luke closes her car door and walks around.]
LUKE: So I thought we'd go to Marino's. You like Marino's, right?
LORELAI: Mmm. [Her attention is on the C.D. in her hand. She looks baffled as she holds it up.] What is this?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Reggae Fever?
LUKE: So?
LORELAI: When did you buy this? Where did you buy this? Why did you buy this?
LUKE: I was at the gas station last week. It was at the register. What's the big deal?
LORELAI: The big deal is it's Reggae Fever.
LUKE: I know!
LORELAI: When you look in the mirror, do you see Reggae Fever?
LUKE: It was cheap.
LORELAI: ‘Ja Glory' by Toots Bambada. ‘Lively up Yourself' by the Family Zigzag, ‘Let your Ya be Ya' by Ranking Roy. What else am I going to find in here? Ganja and a yellow, green and red knit cap?
LUKE: I bought a C.D. I didn't adopt the entire Rastafarian culture.
LORELAI: This is so weird. I mean, to think that there was this whole chunk of time when we weren't together. We were living totally separate lives. I was just working like crazy and you were running around, buying reggae C.D.'s.
LUKE: One C.D. One.
LORELAI [sighs]: I just hate that we were apart.
LUKE: Yeah, wasn't too fond of it myself.
LORELAI: Well, all I can say is, you're lucky I'm back in your life, because clearly you were lost without me. I mean, it's a miracle you're even still alive. Right?
LUKE: You bet.
[They smile. Luke starts the truck.]
Q.T. PARTY
[Rory and Robert walk in. Robert is wearing a white t-shirt covered in blood, and Rory is back in the Chilton uniform, dressed as Gogo Yubari. A girl walks by with a tray of shots. Robert grabs two.]
ROBERT: Not a moment too soon. [He offers one to Rory.]
RORY: Oh, no thanks. I think I'm going to try to get through the doorway first.
ROBERT: Huh, novel approach. You're going to be an interesting date.
[Finn joins them, dressed as Vincent Vega.]
FINN: Robert! What are you?
ROBERT: Dead extra number two.
FINN: Brilliant, my friend.
ROBERT: Happy birthday, Finn. You owe me forty dollars.
FINN: Well, maybe for my birthday you'll forgive me that. [Robert gives him a serious look. Finn pulls out his wallet.] Does your father have any idea what a toll his cross-dressing took on your psyche?
ROBERT: That was your father, Finn.
FINN: Ah, you're right. [He holds up his hands to display the painted fingernails.] My God, that explains a lot. Do I know you?
ROBERT: Rory Gilmore, Finn.
FINN: Pleasure to meet you. [Rory smiles awkwardly.] All right, children, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we will all be in a great deal of pain. [He takes the tray of shots from the girl who is walking past again.] Thank you, darling. Your name and phone number would also be appreciated. [She walks away. Finn winks and dances after her.]
RORY: Finn's quite an original.
ROBERT: Yes, he is. Have I told you I like your costume?
RORY: No, you didn't.
[She sees Logan on a couch with the Bride. His costume is Butch Coolidge. He smiles at Rory.]
ROBERT: All right. Did that count, or are you expecting me to say it again?
RORY: I think we're good.
[Cut over to Logan on the couch.]
LOGAN: Let's get a drink.
[They get up. Cut back to Rory and Robert. Colin, wearing a blond wig as Bill, joins them.]
RORY: Oh, hey, Colin. Where's your date?
COLIN: I went to go pick her up. She's dressed like Mira Sorvino.
ROBERT: How do you dress like Mira Sorvino?
COLIN: You have blonde hair and a name tag that says ‘Mira Sorvino'. I just turned around and left.
LOGAN [joining the group]: Well, well, well. The gang's all here. Robert, good to see you.
ROBERT: Hello, Logan.
LOGAN: Rory, like the costume.
RORY: I like yours too.
LOGAN: This is Whitney. Whitney, Robert, Rory. You know Colin.
WHITNEY: Hi.
COLIN: Whitney, is your friend Josie here?
WHITNEY: Yeah, she's over there with the guy dressed like Harvey Weinstein.
COLIN: Perfect. I'll see you later.
WHITNEY: Leave her alone, Colin.
COLIN: Yes, yes. Of course. [He goes.]
LOGAN: So. Good party, huh?
ROBERT: Seems like it.
RORY: Music's cool.
LOGAN: Very cool. Well, we're just heading over to the bar, can we get you two anything?
ROBERT: No, we're just going to take a look around.
LOGAN: Okay, well, catch you later.
RORY: Sounds good. [They head in different directions.] Hey, Robert.
ROBERT: Yes.
RORY: What's your last name?
LUKE'S TRUCK
[Lorelai is playing with the swan-shaped leftovers. Reggae Fever is playing.]
LUKE: My God, turn that off!
LORELAI: Getting to you, huh?
LUKE: You keep playing the same song over and over and over.
[They get out of the truck.]
LORELAI: I've got news for you. That was not the same song.
LUKE: Oh my God, you're kidding.
[They hear a noise from inside Lorelai's garage.]
LUKE: What was that?
LORELAI: I don't know.
LUKE: Sounds like it came from the garage.
LORELAI: There's someone in my garage?
[They head over to find out what it is. Luke picks up a shovel.]
LORELAI: Huh. Weird time for gardening, isn't it?
LUKE: It could be like a raccoon.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, don't shovel the raccoon.
LUKE: Just stay back, will you?
LORELAI: No, Luke! You can't hurt a raccoon. They're cute. They have face masks like little furry burglars.
LUKE: And sharp teeth that chew through your wiring, and rabies –
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: I'm not going to hit it, I'm going to scare it.
LORELAI: Hey! Why don't you play it your Reggae Fever.
[Luke pushes around her and into the garage. Lorelai follows him.]
LORELAI [whispering]: Do you see it?
LUKE: Sh! [He listens for a moment.] That's one hell of a raccoon.
LORELAI: Shovel him. Shovel him! Shovel him!
[Luke turns on the light. Kirk is asleep in the boat. He has a blanket barely covering his body.]
LORELAI: I probably should be more surprised than I am, right?
[Luke bangs on the side of the boat with the shovel.]
LUKE: Kirk! Wake up.
[Kirk stretches and sits up.]
LORELAI: And he's naked. [She holds up her hand, Luke turns away.]
LUKE: Oh, Kirk! Geez!
KIRK: Where am I?
LORELAI: You're in my house, Kirk.
LUKE: You're in my boat, Kirk.
KIRK: I'm exposed.
LORELAI: We know, Kirk.
LUKE: Yeah, let's do something about that, huh, Kirk?
KIRK [wrapping himself in the blanket]: I'm good now.
[Luke and Lorelai turn to face him. Lorelai leans on the edge of the boat.]
LORELAI [calmly]: Kirk. Whatcha doin' here?
KIRK: I left Mother's.
LORELAI: No, did you have a fight? Did she take away your Beach Boys album again?
KIRK: No, I just got so excited about the thought of a new life, you know? Of striking out on my own and being my own man. Right, Luke?
LORELAI: Right, Luke?
KIRK: So I did it. I packed my clothes and I gave my mother my key and I said good bye and I left.
LORELAI: Aw, Kirk. That's a big deal, you leaving like that.
KIRK: I know it is. But Luke explained to me that if I really want to move to the next level with Lulu and have a real, grownup relationship, with sleepovers and everything, then I had to get out.
LUKE: I don't think that's exactly what I said.
KIRK: Oh, yes, it was. And I felt really good about it, until I realized that I had no place to go. I probably should have found an apartment first.
LUKE: Probably.
LORELAI: You can stay in Rory's room.
KIRK: Really?
LUKE: Really?
LORELAI: Just for tonight. We'll find you some place tomorrow.
KIRK: Okay.
[He gets up to go inside.]
KIRK: You know, I think you've got a raccoon in here.
LORELAI: Just go on in the house, Kirk. [He goes. She turns to Luke.] What were you thinking?
LUKE: Kirk was at the diner talking about how he wished how he and Lulu had what we have, and I just mentioned –
LORELAI: Are you insane? Everybody knows you can't mention anything to Kirk.
LUKE: I was cornered. I was tired. I wanted to go to sleep.
LORELAI: Well, now we have to go in there and take care of him. He is now our responsibility.
LUKE: But –
LORELAI: Uh, uh! Pottery Barn, baby. You break it, you buy it.
LUKE: Ah, geez.
[Lorelai goes inside.]
Q.T. PARTY
[The party is in full swing. Rory and Robert are standing at a table.]
ROBERT: My entire goal in life is to outlive my brother, inherit the family fortune, put all my sisters out on the street and live as frivolously as possible, have numerous wives, thousands of illegitimate children and die completely alone and leave every cent to a parrot named Polly.
RORY: That's your entire goal in life.
ROBERT: Except for the name of the parrot, I stick to everything I just said.
RORY: You're a fascinating specimen, Robert.
COLIN [joining them]: Well, Josie's a lesbian.
RORY: You struck out, Colin?
COLIN: Whatever. Is Lydia here?
ROBERT: Yeah, she's here with Patrick, her fiancé.
COLIN: God, I hate these stupid incestuous parties! It's the same people over and over.
[Finn comes up from behind and puts his arm around Colin.]
FINN: Who's as drunk as I am?
COLIN: No one since Spencer Tracy died. Finn, are there any interesting women here at all?
FINN: Have you tried Josie?
COLIN: I'm getting a drink.
FINN: All righty. I have to go make the rounds. [To Rory] Have I met you yet?
RORY: Several times.
FINN: All right then. [He leaves.]
ROBERT: So, how about that drink?
RORY: Nothing too strong?
ROBERT: I'll see what I can do. [He leaves her alone at the table. Logan approaches her.]
LOGAN: Hey, Ace. Having a good time?
RORY: I am, thanks.
LOGAN: Good. That's good. Me, too. I'm having a good time too.
RORY: Good.
LOGAN: Yes, it is good. [He takes a drink.] So I didn't know you knew Robert.
RORY: I met him at the Life and Death Brigade gathering. And the poker game.
LOGAN: Oh. Right, right. Well, he must have made quite an impression.
RORY: He just asked me out, is all.
LOGAN: Sure. [Takes another drink.] He's kind of a jerk.
RORY: Excuse me?
LOGAN: Robert. He's kind of a jerk. Haven't you noticed he's kind of a jerk?
RORY: Nope.
LOGAN: Huh. [Drinks.] Night's young. Okay, come on.
RORY: Where are we going? Logan!
[He grabs her wrist and pulls her into a corner.]
LOGAN: You look great.
RORY: Thank you.
[He kisses her forcefully. After a moment, she pushes him away.]
RORY: Logan, stop.
LOGAN: Right, so, how you been?
RORY: I've been fine.
LOGAN: Good. School's good?
RORY: School's hard.
LOGAN: Well, it's supposed to be hard. It's grounding you for life.
[They kiss.]
LOGAN: Making you an upstanding citizen.
[They kiss.
RORY: God-fearing Christian.
LOGAN: Habitual recycler.
[They kiss. Rory stops him.]
RORY: We can't do this here, Logan.
LOGAN: You're right. Let's go.
RORY: Go where?
LOGAN: Your place. My place. Let's take a train to New York, spend the night in the Plaza.
RORY: We can't just leave. We have dates.
LOGAN: I don't like this.
RORY: Like what?
LOGAN: You here with Robert.
RORY: You're here with Whitney.
LOGAN: I know!
RORY: So, what's the problem?
LOGAN: The problem is you're here with Robert and it's bothering me, and I don't like that it's bothering me.
RORY: Sorry. Do you want us to leave?
LOGAN: No, I want us to leave. You and me.
RORY: I can't do that.
LOGAN: Oh, you want to spend the rest of the night with Robert instead of me?
RORY: I came here with Robert.
LOGAN: So dump Robert! I hate Robert!
RORY: He's your friend!
LOGAN: So what? I still hate him.
RORY: Logan, you're the one who said –
LOGAN: I know what I said.
RORY: Okay, then. I have to go. I have a date. Enjoy the rest of the party.
[She crosses the room. Finn's Vincent has found his Mia and they are dancing up a storm in the middle of the dance floor.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Luke and Lorelai are hanging out in the kitchen.]
LUKE: There's nothing in here but ice cream, candy bars, cookie dough, canned frosting. Why are you not four hundred and fifty pounds? [He puts a liter of ice cream on the table.]
LORELAI: I know. Scientists call it the Lorelai Paradox.
LUKE: Who are you calling?
LORELAI: No one. Just seeing if Rory left a message.
[Luke sets two bowls on the table.]
LORELAI: Who's washing those?
[Luke puts the bowls away.]
LUKE: Why, was she supposed to leave a message?
LORELAI: No, I was just hoping.
[He puts two spoons on the table.]
LORELAI: Are we out of plastic?
[Luke goes back to the drawer.]
LUKE: Why were you hoping? Everything okay with her?
LORELAI: Yeah, she just had a date tonight. Get four, those tend to break.
[Luke gets up again.]
LUKE: Okay. Uh, she out with that Logan kid?
LORELAI: No. Robert.
LUKE: Who's Robert?
LORELAI: I know nothing about him except his last name is Grimmaldi.
LUKE: When did she break up with Logan?
LORELAI: She didn't.
LUKE: I don't understand.
LORELAI: It's college.
LUKE: What does that mean?
LORELAI: It means, butt out, back off, none of your business.
LUKE: Oh.
LORELAI: Rory suddenly decided she's dating girl.
LUKE: Well, that's okay, right? Isn't that what kids are supposed to do?
LORELAI: It's just, it's not Rory. I don't think it's what is going to make her happy. It seems wrong for her.
LUKE: You say something to her?
LORELAI: No. I mean, she's been so chatty lately, wanting to be able to talk about Logan and her life, so now I just don't know what to do.
LUKE: You talk back.
LORELAI: I am, but I just feel like I need to be really careful what I say.
LUKE: Oh, come on. That's ridiculous.
LORELAI: Well, she's not at home anymore. She' s on her own.
LUKE: Doesn't matter.
LORELAI: It matters a little. You know, there have been very few times in our relationship when I ever played the ‘mom card'. But I always had it there in my back pocket. And when I used it she had to hear it and take it, ‘cause she lived here. And even if she didn't like it or even if she got mad, the worst that would happen is she would run into her room and slam the door and blast the Jam. But then in the morning, I controlled the bathroom, and the, and the Pop-tarts, and she had to deal with me. And eventually we'd make up and it was over. But now –
LUKE: Nothing's different.
LORELAI: Of course it is. It's different. She's on her own. She's making her own decisions. My ‘mom card' is looking a little flimsier, and I don't know how much to say to her. If she doesn't want to hear it, she doesn't have to take it. She doesn't have to call, or come home.
LUKE: She'll call. She'll come home.
[Kirk, wrapped in his Superman blanket, comes out of Rory's bedroom, presumably looking for the bathroom.]
LORELAI: Yeah. I hope so. I don't know. [They hear a door open.] Did we lock the front door?
LUKE: I'll be right back. [He gets up.] Kirk! Get back here, Kirk!
LUKE'S DINER
[Emily enters, furious.]
EMILY: What on earth is wrong with you, besides the obvious lack of fashion sense?
LUKE: What are you –
EMILY: I told you to get back together with Lorelai! I told you exactly what to do and exactly what to say. What do you need, a cheat sheet?
LUKE: Emily –
EMILY: Some flash cards, some Sesame Street characters to sing a song about it?
LUKE: Look!
EMILY: Do you think that it was easy for me to come to you like that? Do you think I enjoyed it? Like I was just sitting around my house thinking, hmm, what shall I do tonight? I know. I can drive to Stars Hollow and humiliate myself at the local greasy spoon!
LUKE: Okay, I am in the middle of –
EMILY: I don't care what you're in the middle of! My family is being torn apart because for some reason you are incapable of taking simple instructions and putting your relationship back together! [As she is talking, Luke takes his cell phone out of his pocket, presses a button and sets it on the counter.]
STARS HOLLOW
[Down the street, Lorelai's phone rings.]
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: Just because you run a diner and have mastered the art of the blank stare does not mean it's going to work with me!
[Lorelai looks around, confused, then gets it.]
LORELAI: Ah –
[She runs to the diner.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai rushes in. Emily is still screeching at Luke]
EMILY: And Richard went through a great deal of trouble to set the whole thing up, and you never even called Herb Smith! Apparently, you can't follow through with anything! Not even a razor!
LORELAI: Mom, what are you doing here?
EMILY: I am having what I'm sure will turn out to be yet another fruitless conversation with this man.
LORELAI [to Luke]: I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.
LUKE: It's okay.
LORELAI: Mom, go home. You have no right to barge in here and cause a scene.
EMILY: I have something I want to say.
LORELAI: No! We don't want to hear what you have to say! We just want you to please butt out of our lives!
EMILY: Our lives? [She looks at Luke] So there's an ‘our lives'? Are you two back together?
LORELAI: Yes, we are.
EMILY [smiles at Luke]: So you did go to her. Just like I told you to.
LUKE: We got back together because we wanted to get back together.
EMILY [turns back to Lorelai[: Then I simply don't understand. If you're together, then what's the problem?
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
EMILY: Why won't you come to Friday dinner? Whatever happened between the two of you, I obviously fixed it, so –
LORELAI: You fixed it? You broke it! Just because Luke and I found a way to repair the damage doesn't erase the fact that it happened!
EMILY: What I did I did out of concern.
LORELAI: Oh, please!
EMILY: As your mother, I have the right to be concerned. Especially when it looks like you're taking your life down a completely disastrous path. I had to jump in, and –
LORELAI [growling]: Mom!
EMILY [shocked]: Lorelai!
LORELAI: Please hear me. If I want your input in my life in any way, shape or form, I will ask for it. Until then, do us all a favor and shut up!
[Emily, stunned, looks at her daughter for a moment, then turns and walks out the door.]
LUKE: Well, I gotta say, suddenly a big fan of speed-dial.
[Lorelai, drained and obviously shocked at what just happened, sits on the stool. Luke squeezes her hand and leaves her alone.]
DRAGONFLY INN
[Lorelai's cell phone rings. Scene cuts between the inn and Rory's dorm.]
LORELAI: Hey, kid, what's going on?
RORY: I just got a call from Kirk. He wanted to know if he could crash at my dorm.
LORELAI: Ho, boy.
RORY: How did he get my number?
LORELAI: Oh, he probably got it off the fridge.
RORY: Okay. And what was Kirk doing near our fridge?
LORELAI: It's a long story.
RORY: Okay, well, tell me later. I want to hear how the back-together date went.
LORELAI: It was very successful.
RORY: Did he like the dress?
LORELAI: The dress was a hit.
RORY: I told you.
LORELAI: And, um, how was your, uh, date with Robert?
RORY: Completely insane. You won't believe the evening I had.
LORELAI: Oh, tell me.
RORY: So Robert and I get to the party, and Logan was there, and at first everything was completely cas, and then as the evening went on, he got more and more jealous.
LORELAI: Huh, really?
RORY: Oh yeah. He wanted me to leave with him, blow off Robert.
LORELAI [shocked]: And did you?
RORY: No, of course not. I told him that I came with Robert and I was leaving with Robert, and I walked away, and it was great.
LORELAI: Sounds great.
RORY: And since then, by the way, Logan has called twice today, we're going out tonight, and we've already made plans for this week. Complete and total turn-around.
LORELAI: Wow. Well, sounds like all the balls are in your court. Or, well, you know what I mean.
RORY: You okay? You sound down.
LORELAI: No, no, no. I'm fine. So what are you going to wear tonight?
RORY: Oh, I thought I'd go with the twenty-minute sweater.
LORELAI: Oh, cute. Cute.
[Michel walks by, talking on the inn's cordless.]
MICHEL: The answer is no. Look, Jerry. I sold you the motor home. It is now yours. I'm a very busy man. I do not have time for this. [Pause.] All right. For twenty dollars I will measure the shower for you. [He goes outside.] No, that is on top of the forty for the cupboard space and the pull-out table. Well, I'm sorry if you're feeling ripped off. I can call Elastic Pants Lady and see if she'd like to take the motor home off your hands. [Pause.] I thought so. Hold on.
[He opens the door on the side of the motor home. He gets in and pulls a measuring tape out of his pocket. He walks toward the back end. Kirk is asleep, naked, in the bed. Michel sighs, glares, and leaves.]

STARS HOLLOW
[Town residents are standing in a long line going into a large brick house with massive white columns. Lorelai and Sookie are near the back of the line, with Davey asleep in his stroller.]
LORELAI: Ugh, raisins. What are the pruney red things?
SOOKIE: Dried cranberries.
LORELAI: Gone. What's this?
SOOKIE: Carob.
LORELAI: Adios.
SOOKIE: Okay, why do we buy trail mix if you're going to pick everything out?
LORELAI: Well, they've ruined trail mix. Used to be simple. Now they put too much stuff in it. Your mouth doesn't know what to expect with any given bite. Will it be fruity? Will it be granola-y? Will it be chocolate substitute-y? What's this?
SOOKIE: Soybean.
LORELAI: Bah, squirrel food! [She throws the soybean on the ground.]
[Taylor, ahead of them, turns around.]
TAYLOR: Ladies, please. We're saying good-bye to Mr. Twickham.
SOOKIE: So?
TAYLOR: The man's on his deathbed. Show a little respect.
LORELAI: Taylor, Old Man Twickham's been dying for twenty years.
MISS PATTY: This is my seventeenth time saying adios.
LORELAI: Yeah, I think you have the record, Patty.
SOOKIE: I forget, when was the last time we thought he was dying?
MISS PATTY: It's been a good two years.
LORELAI: I remember now. The last time - the rain?
SOOKIE: We got drenched.
LORELAI: Made the whole "he's dying" thing a total bummer.
TAYLOR: Ladies, please! You may not be respecting this moment but all the rest of us are.
[Kirk walks by carrying an assortment of flags, beach balls, hats, and other souvenirs.]
KIRK: Get your Twickham souvenirs here! Twickham souvenirs! I've got your bats! I've got your balls! I've got your foam fingers! Get 'em before he's gone!
[Andrew walks by.]
LORELAI: Oh, how's Mr. Twickham looking, Andrew?
ANDREW: A little tired.
LORELAI: Well, dying is exhausting.
ANDREW: Yeah, he's thinking of taking a break and picking up again tomorrow.
SOOKIE: Ugh, no.
LORELAI: We've been waiting for an hour.
ANDREW: He's kind of distracted anyway. The whole time I was there he was Tivo-ing through a fresh Summerland.
[Andrew leaves. Sookie turns to Lorelai.]
SOOKIE: Do we have time to come back tomorrow?
LORELAI: Uh, no. Not really. [She calls out.] Hey, everybody? Um, keep it quick in there, okay? "Good morning, Mr. Twickham. Good-bye Mr. Twickham." And then vamoose.
SOOKIE: He should really start dying earlier in the day.
LORELAI: Yeah. [Digging in the bag of trail mix.] Ugh, green stuff? Come on! [She throws it.] What's green?
OPENING CREDITS
YALE DORMS - RORY'S BEDROOM
[The score from a Star Wars movie is playing loudly from the common room. Rory's cell phone rings.]
RORY: Hello?
[Scene cuts between Lorelai's kitchen and Rory's room.]
LORELAI: He's dead.
RORY: Who?
LORELAI: Old Man Twickham.
RORY [disbelief]: No!
LORELAI: Yes!
RORY: It's got to be a mistake.
LORELAI: It's not. The man is gone.
RORY: I don't believe it. I mean, are you sure?
LORELAI: There's no breath left in him. The light's gone out of his eyes. He smelled the burnt almonds. He's feeding the worms. He's chatting up his grandpa. He is the old man formerly known as Twickham.
RORY: Wow. I can't believe he's gone. I mean, he's been dying my whole life.
LORELAI: And I just got my good-bye in. He was about to close shop for the day but we got in, told him good-bye and that we'd miss him, we left and then apparently he just closed his eyes. Muttered something about Lori Loughlin and that was that.
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: He's never died before.
LORELAI: I guess there's a first time for everything. Kirk's happy, though. His dying caused a run on souvenirs. [She looks at the beach ball, hats and flags on her counter.]
RORY [disapproving]: Tacky.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. Tacky. So, are you coming home this weekend?
RORY: Probably not. Maybe next week.
LORELAI: Okay. I just always like to check.
RORY: So, I should go. Sorry about Old Man Twickham.
LORELAI: Got to move on. I hear Old Man Ketchum has a nasty cough. Could turn into something.
RORY: That's the spirit. Bye.
[She hangs up the phone and goes out into the common room. Paris is slumped on a chair, wearing pajamas, remote in hand.]
RORY [shouting over the movie]: Pathetic!
PARIS: What?
RORY: Nothing important, I just wanted to inform you that you're pathetic!
PARIS: Back at you, sister.
RORY: I am not pathetic.
PARIS: Oh, come on. We're in the same situation, except you're in denial.
RORY: I'm not in denial!
PARIS: I haven't seen Logan lately.
RORY: Well, why don't you call him up, then? Bet he misses you.
PARIS: Is he missing you?
RORY: Good-bye.
PARIS: Have fun pretending the sky is green.
RORY: Yeah, have fun re-enacting the Maxell tape ad.
[Rory slams the door behind her. Paris furiously turns up the already-too-loud volume.]
STARS HOLLOW - SOPHIE'S MUSIC SHOP
[Lane and Zach enter. Sophie is behind the counter.]
ZACH: Hey Soph.
SOPHIE: You wash your hands?
ZACH: Front and back.
SOPHIE: Let's see 'em.
ZACH: So we're never going to forget the peanut butter on the sitar? [He holds up his hands.]
SOPHIE: Good God, man, have you heard of hand cream?
ZACH: Okay if we walk around?
SOPHIE: Carefully. Hi, Lane.
LANE: Hi, Sophie.
[Zach and Lane take a few steps. Zach starts whispering to Lane.]
ZACH: Show her the thing.
LANE: Something like that's very self-conscious.
ZACH: It's why you brought it.
LANE: I know.
ZACH: So, show her.
[Lane walks back over to the counter.]
LANE: So, Sophie Bloom. Your last name's Bloom.
SOPHIE: Thanks for the info.
LANE: I was looking through some old vinyl I have. I don't have much, because I was born right on the cusp of the CD revolution. But I originally had a record player. A Snoopy record player. Boy, I love this record player. And shutting my door and listening to music on it -
SOPHIE: Oh, my God, Garrison Keillor, what is your point?
LANE: I saw the name "Sophie Bloom" on this album - the one non-Christian one my mother allowed me to have. It just popped out at me and I was wondering - [She hands the record to Sophie.]
SOPHIE [a little repulsed]: Oh, this thing.
LANE: So, it's you. You wrote these songs.
SOPHIE: Long time ago.
LANE [gushing]: I think this is amazing! Because I want to do more than just drum. I would like to write and compose and I was wondering if we could sit down sometime and just talk about music, because I think you have so much you can pass on to me. Woman to woman. Really, just coffee sometime. My treat.
SOPHIE: Well, I suppose sometime when I'm not working or out of town, if my boyfriend's busy and my laundry's done, and I'm not sick and there's nothing on TV, we could maybe meet up for a couple of minutes.
LANE: It's a date.
[Smiling, she re-joins Zach as he browses.]
LUKE'S DINER - NIGHT
[Luke is cleaning up when Lorelai enters.]
LUKE: Hey, there she is, the woman of the hour!
LORELAI: Apparently that's me. [They hug.]
LUKE: I am blown away by this!
LORELAI: Yeah, well, my hugs are that powerful.
LUKE: Well, well, I'm talking about the article. You're going to be on the cover of a magazine! That's a big deal!
LORELAI: Well, it's the inn, it's not me, but yes, it is a big deal!
LUKE: So, how'd they tell you? They phone you, or they, you know, they e-mail you?
LORELAI: They just said they were so impressed by the inn, they were so impressed by my story-
LUKE: It's a great story.
LORELAI: Well, it's a little thin, when you compare it to w*r and Peace, but
-
LUKE: What? You started with nothing. It's a great story. The magazine's pretty good, too. I did some research.
LORELAI: Oh. Research?
[He pulls out a few magazines from under the counter.]
LUKE: Yeah, I got a bunch of back issues and I read them. I tried to figure out who should interview you. Okay. Alicia Kensington. Staff writer, too green and way too stiff. Too many adverbs. Frederick Fairmount. Pff, he talks more about himself than the person he's interviewing. Something boozy about him, too.
LORELAI: I don't think they let you pick who's going to interview you.
LUKE: Well, just in case they offer. But this is big. [He touches her arm.]
LORELAI [smiles]: Yeah, I guess it is.
[She sees the window between the Diner and the ice cream shop, taped up with newspaper.]
LORELAI: Oh! What happened there?
LUKE: Eh, what do you think? Taylor.
LORELAI: How did Taylor break the window?
LUKE: How do you think? By being Taylor.
LORELAI: Taylor's Taylor-ness can now break glass?
LUKE: You know what I mean. He's doing something, and crash, bang, there you go. Hey, is it, uh, six yet?
LORELAI: Uh, a little past.
LUKE: Ah, sh**t. Town meeting's started.
LORELAI: So?
LUKE: So I thought we'd go. I mean, you like those things, right?
LORELAI: Uh, yeah, but you don't.
LUKE: Yes, but, this is your big night, you know, with the article and everything. Look, why don't we hit the town meeting and then we'll go get something to eat, like a little celebration?
LORELAI: Oh, sounds good!
LUKE: Yeah, great! Let's go, we got to, we got to hurry.
LORELAI: Okay.
[He hurries her out the door.]
STARS HOLLOW TOWN MEETING
[Taylor is addressing the town with Kirk standing next to him.]
TAYLOR: Come on, people! It's not that complicated.
KIRK: I don't want to be a burden.
TAYLOR: Patty? What about that couch you have at the back or your studio?
[Patty opens her mouth to respond, but is cut off by Kirk.]
KIRK: In her freezing cold studio with no insulation and no heat. Sounds great.
[Taylor continues as Luke and Lorelai sneak in the back and sit next to Sookie.]
SOOKIE [whispers]: Hi.
LORELAI: Hi, what's happening?
SOOKIE: Problems with Kirk's schedule.
LORELAI: Ah. Can't Sheriff Taylor just let him share a cell with Otis for the night?
MISS PATTY: Well, maybe the Morris' will take him again.
KIRK: Their kids stuck things in my nose.
MISS PATTY: Well, then, lock the door when you sleep!
KIRK: It wasn't while I was asleep.
SOOKIE [whispering to Lorelai]: Hey. How'd you drag Luke here?
LORELAI: He wanted to come.
KIRK: I'll just sleep outside in the gazebo. I would ask, though, that if I die from exposure, don't just dump me in the landfill.
MISS PATTY: No one's dumping you in a landfill, Kirk.
TAYLOR [regretfully]: It's against regulations. Let's pigeonhole this matter for now, people. Get on to our next order of business. It's the matter of the estate of the late Joshua Twickham. As you know -
LORELAI [whispers to Sookie]: You bring food?
SOOKIE: After the trail mix fiasco, I wouldn't dare.
[Luke shushes her.]
SOOKIE: Sorry.
[Lorelai and Sookie exchange an amused look.]
TAYLOR: I am happy to say that this beloved elder was generous even on his deathbed. Mr. Twickham has left his beautiful home to the town.
[The townspeople murmur.]
KIRK: Is his deathbed still there? I'm not picky.
LUKE: What does that mean, to the town?
TALYOR: Luke! What are you doing here?
LUKE: Just keep going, Taylor.
TAYLOR: He left the house to the Historical Society along with his ample collection of valuable memorabilia. His will stipulates that the house is to be converted into a museum.
LUKE: A museum?
TAYLOR: Are you going to interrupt me the whole meeting?
LUKE: I'm just asking.
TAYLOR: A Stars Hollow museum. We will display his personal historical artifacts for a period of two months. After two months, the house is to be disposed of at the discretion of the head of the Historical Society, he meaning me.
LUKE: Oh, goody.
TAYLOR: So now you're going to talk under your breath.
LUKE: I'm sorry.
TAYLOR: Funny, I didn't hear those words come out of your mouth this morning after you tried to k*ll me.
LORELAI [looks at Luke]: What?
TAYLOR: So, we're going to need strong volunteers to make this dream a reality. Now, anyone with appropriate k*ll, let's see a show of hands.
[Several men, including Luke, raise their hands.]
LORELAI: Uh, you're really going to have to fill me in on the gag, here.
TAYLOR: Luke, don't come to these things just to mock our business.
LUKE: I'm not mocking anything, I'm volunteering.
TAYLOR: After you threw a frying pan at my head.
LORELAI: You threw a frying pan at Taylor's head?
TAYLOR: Just for playing my Muzak too loud. I mean, who doesn't love Muzak?
SOOKIE [raises her hand]: Oh! Music lovers?
LUKE: The thing slipped out of my hand.
TAYLOR: Right after you said, quote, um, "you better duck, Taylor, because I'm going to throw this frying pan at your head"?
LORELAI: You threw a frying pan at Taylor's head without me there? I hate you.
LUKE: I'm volunteering. Take it or leave it.
TAYLOR: Patty, take down the names of the legitimate volunteers, please. Now, whoever's actually going to show up, our day starts at seven sharp. To the rest, shame on you. Now, onto item number three. The budgetary concerns about the new snowplow.
LORELAI [to Luke]: I'm sorry, does Taylor have compromising pictures of you or something?
LUKE: It's no joke.
LORELAI: Why on earth are you volunteering for Taylor?
LUKE: Well, um –
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: How well did you know Old Man Twickham?
LORELAI: Somewhat.
LUKE: Well, I knew him all my life. He was like another dad, in a way.
LORELAI: Oh. Nice.
LUKE: And I didn't show up to say good-bye, and I'm feeling a little guilty about it, you know. He's a good guy. I just want to do right by him.
LORELAI: Well. You are a terrific fellow, Luke Danes.
TAYLOR: No, Kirk. If you build an igloo to sleep in, and the town plow runs over it, it k*ll you, we are not going to just leave your corpse in the snow.
KIRK: Okay, but I don't want to be a burden.
STARS HOLLOW – TWICKHAM HOUSE
[Taylor walks down the front step talking to a man who is writing on a clipboard.]
TAYLOR: Let's store all the boxes inside. Sort through them in there, then store what we don't need in the garage.
[The man nods. Luke gets out of his truck.]
LUKE: Morning, Taylor.
TAYLOR: What are you doing here?
LUKE: I volunteered.
TAYLOR: I don't get the joke.
LUKE: There's no joke! I'm at your disposal.
[Taylor frowns and turns back to the man with the clipboard.]
TAYLOR: Now, we're going to need a nice flat staging area, perhaps over there, [he points] because there's no space here out front.
LUKE: What about right here? [He points at a space right next to where they are standing.]
TAYLOR: My office is going here.
LUKE: Your office? Why do you need an office?
TAYLOR: So you came to complain?
LUKE: No, I was just –
TAYLOR: I'm organizing! I'm working! I need an office!
LUKE: Okay, fine. Sorry. Carry on.
TAYLOR [calling out]: Come on, everybody! [To the clipboard man] Let's hook up with people inside and I'll start handing out assignments.
[They start walking into the house. Luke follows. Taylor turns around.]
TAYLOR: Eh, where are you going?
LUKE: Inside.
TAYLOR: Why?
LUKE: I'm a volunteer!
[Taylor rolls his eyes and they all go inside.]
KYLE: Hey, Luke.
LUKE: Hey, Kyle.
KYLE: Just thought I'd lend a hand.
LUKE: Uh-huh, good one.
[Kyle has a hook instead of his right hand.]
TAYLOR: Is this everybody, people?
KIRK: I believe so, Taylor.
GYPSY [to Luke]: What the hell are you doing here?
LUKE: I can't keep answering this question.
TAYLOR: Come in, good folk. We are embarking on a wonderful adventure. Right here in this room, we will display Mr. Twickham's impressive collection of memorabilia. Upstairs, we'll house the multimedia dioramas depicting the history of the town.
LUKE: Sounds good.
TAYLOR: Now, I took the liberty of doing up some fun shirts that we all can wear. Everyone, please. Put one on.
[Kirk starts handing out the bright orange t-shirts. The volunteers mumble as they put on the shirts.]
TAYLOR: Isn't that nice. Now, they all take a cold water wash and tumble dry. Low. Now, before we begin, I'd like us all to join hands.
LUKE: What?
GYPSY: He's a twisted little perv if you ask me.
TAYLOR: Come on, everybody, take hands.
[Luke rolls his eyes, but takes Taylor's hand on the right, and "hooks" up with Kyle on the left.]
TAYLOR: Let's close our eyes and visualize our goal. Picture a freckle-faced boy, eyes wide with curiosity, drinking in the history of the town as he wanders the room. He's by the door, he's going by the stairs, he's delighting –
KIRK: Luke's peeking.
LUKE: That means you're peeking too, snitch.
TAYLOR: Quiet! Please!
GYPSY: Hey, I've lost track. Where's the freckle-faced kid walking?
TAYLOR: Okay, I think that's enough visualizing, everybody. How about we start organizing all these boxes, okay?
[The circle breaks apart. Luke tries to pull away, but Taylor holds on.]
TAYLOR: I'd like a moment with you, Luke.
LUKE: Yeah, time to let go, there, Taylor!
TAYLOR: I want the straight skinny from you.
LUKE: Really, let go of my hand.
TAYLOR: Not until you tell me what you're doing.
LUKE: I'm really just trying to get my hand away from you.
TAYLOR: Why are you here? Why did you volunteer?
LUKE: Because I wanted to!
TAYLOR: Luke, you hated Old Man Twickham. I know that for a fact. You said despicable things about him your whole life!
LUKE: Well, okay. If you must know, Lorelai asked me.
TAYLOR: Lorelai?
LUKE: That's right. You know, we've been through a bit of a rough patch –
TAYLOR: Yes.
LUKE: Well, I want to make things right with her. Get off to a good new start. She really wants me to get involved with community things, so she asked me to get involved. So, I'm doing it for her.
TAYLOR: Well, I think that's very nice.
LUKE: So I'm here for you, Taylor. One hundred percent.
TAYLOR: Good. Because you're not untalented.
LUKE [trying unsuccessfully to take his hand back]: Thank you.
TAYLOR: How about I make you my right-hand man? Stick by me! Be me when I'm
not here! What do you say?
LUKE: Well, I'll need my right hand back for that, I think.
TAYLOR: Of course. [He lets go of Luke's hand.] Okay. Good. This is a new side of you, Luke, and I like it. All right, let's get started, everybody! [He turns away.] Kirk, grab Kyle and come on over and help me start in this corner.
[Luke examines his hand.]
DRAGONFLY INN – LIBRARY
[Lorelai is being interviewed for the travel magazine. The reporter, Sandra, is writing as she talks.]
SANDRA: So, which is your favorite room?
LORELAI: Oh, that changes daily. Today it's the library.
SANDRA: What do you love about it?
LORELAI: It – hugs you. You know – does that sound silly?
SANDRA: Not at all.
LORELAI: Um, the kitchen turned out so wonderfully. So the kitchen and the library are duking it out right now.
SANDRA: I should definitely get the name of your designer.
LORELAI: Numerous. We went through quite a few.
SANDRA: Really? The design's so cohesive.
LORELAI: What you see is a lot of me. [Gestures at the notepad she is writing on.] Uh, she said that so humbly.
SANDRA: Hey, credit where credit is due.
LORELAI: I put my soul into this place. My heart. My liver, a couple of kidneys. I had a great partner in Sookie, and, uh, we had a great community rooting for us –
SANDRA: That's what you feel here. Support, family, homeyness, warmth. It must reflect your upbringing.
[Lorelai snorts with laughter.]
SANDRA: No?
LORELAI: I am just happy I wasn't sipping coffee when you said that, it would have come out my nose.
SANDRA: Oh. Childhood wasn't so warm and fuzzy?
LORELAI: You know Superman's fortress of solitude? A Jamaican beach, compared to my mother's house.
SANDRA: So I'll cross your mother off your list of inspirations.
LORELAI: No, I actually did pick up some valuable lessons on running a staff from my mother.
SANDRA: How so?
LORELAI: Well, I consider what my mother would do in a given situation, then I dial it back, and I have what Mussolini would do, then I dial it back, and I have what Stalin would do, and then I dial that back and then it starts approaching what a sane person would do.
SANDRA: Ouch.
LORELAI: You're right. Let's find a topic happier than my relationship with my mother. Basically that would be anything short of famine. [Sandra laughs.] Okay. I will tell you one story about my mother on a family vacation. Jimmy Carter was there. And he had a bigger room.
TWICKHAM HOUSE – INSIDE
[Taylor is walking down the stairs, followed closely by Luke. Both are looking at clipboards.]
TAYLOR: All righty. Upstairs floors and walls cleaned, check. Blackout curtains delivered and ready to be installed, check. Uh, Luke?
LUKE: Yeah.
TAYLOR: It would really help to hear you say ‘check'.
LUKE: Oh, I'm getting it, Taylor. [He points to his clipboard.]
TAYLOR: But how do I know that unless you say ‘check' after I say ‘check'?
LUKE: Fine.
TAYLOR: And audio equipment delivered, awaiting mounting brackets, check?
[He looks at Luke expectantly. Luke rolls his eyes.]
LUKE: Check.
TAYLOR: Excellent.
[There is a commotion involving Kirk by the front door. Taylor goes to check it out. Kirk and Kyle are carrying a naked mannequin into the house.]
TAYLOR: Boys, boys, what's so funny?
KIRK: I took the mannequin by the arms and I said –
KYLE: Wait, wait, I'll tell him. He goes ‘grab the other end' –
KIRK: No, no, I said, ‘grab her end' –
KYLE: Right, so I grabbed her here. Right under her rear end –
KIRK: Her rear end!
KYLE: And I was walking with it like that!
TAYLOR: Really, do I have to separate you two? Now set that down and bring in the others. Modestly.
[Kirk and Kyle walk past him with the mannequin, and burst into laughter again. Kirk looks after them disapprovingly. He then joins Gypsy at a table, where she is sorting through antiques.]
TAYLOR: So, Gypsy. Find some interesting stuff?
GYPSY: How does a George Washington letter sound?
TAYLOR: Fantastic.
LUKE [joining them, and taking the letter]: Wow, that's great!
GYPSY: Mint condition, too.
TAYLOR: Let's frame it, and hang it in a place of honor.
LUKE: Eh, I'm not sure this is what you think it is.
GYPSY: What do you mean? It's a letter to the editor, signed ‘George Washington'.
LUKE: It's dated ‘1944'.
TAYLOR: That's a little smudged, that could be 1744.
LUKE: It mentions Jack Benny.
GYPSY: Well, we could cross out the Jack Benny part.
TAYLOR: Let's put it on the ‘to be displayed' pile and we'll authenticate it at a later date.
LUKE: Actually, why don't we put it in the ‘maybe' pile, Taylor? There's got to be better than this.
TAYLOR: You're right! Let's keep our standards high. Good thinking, Luke. Now, Gypsy, as soon as we have everything catalogued, my man Luke here will liaise with you to co-ordinate your needs.
LUKE: Right, we'll liaise.
GYPSY: Fine. But I'm not doing nothing dirty.
TAYLOR: Carry on. [He walks out.]
LUKE: Hey, so we should start moving this stuff in the other room so we can clean here next –
KYLE [entering with Kirk and another mannequin]: Luke.
LUKE: Yeah?
KYLE: Taylor would like to see you in his office.
LUKE: What? He was just here.
KIRK: That's what he said.
LUKE [to Gypsy]: I'll be right back.
TWICKHAM HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Luke leaves the front door of the house, walks down the steps and up into a large trailer which has been set up for Taylor's office. He knocks on the door.]
TAYLOR [OS]: Come in.
TAYLOR'S TRAILER
[Luke enters. Taylor is pretending to examine his clipboard.]
LUKE: You wanted to see me?
TAYLOR: Ah, Luke. Yes. Sit down, won't you? We need to talk. [Luke sits.] Now, if you're going to disagree with me, which you have every right to, please don't do it in front of the rest of the crew.
LUKE: What are you talking about?
TAYLOR: That George Washington letter. I was humiliated.
LUKE: No you weren't.
TAYLOR: Luke, we're a team. Don't forget that.
LUKE: Fine, okay. I won't disagree with you in front of the crew.
TAYLOR: Good. Although, it's probably safest for you not to disagree with me at all, don't you think?
LUKE: Ah, sure. I agree.
TAYLOR: Good. [His walkie-talkie beeps.]
KIRK [over walkie-talkie]: Taylor!
TAYLOR: This is Taylor Doose.
KIRK: The carpenter is here, Taylor.
TAYLOR: Copy that. [To Luke] Uh, liaise with him, would you?
LUKE: Mm-hm. You took the words right out of my mouth.
[He gets up and leaves.]
TWICKHAM HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Luke leaves the trailer and breaks up a fight between Kirk and Kyle, who are attacking each other with the top halves of two mannequins.]
LUKE: Where's the guy, Kirk?
KIRK: Right over there.
[Luke sees that it is Dean. He waves. Dean glares. Luke looks confused.]
YALE DORMS – RORY'S COMMON ROOM
[Paris is watching a 60's era beach dance party movie. Rory comes out of her room, rolls her eyes and drops a duffel bag.]
PARIS: Every one of these people is dead. That makes me sad.
RORY: That movie is from the sixties. They're not all dead.
PARIS: Well, they're old. Osteoporosistic. These days if they shake it, they break it. That makes me sad.
RORY: Switch back to Moller.
PARIS: Hey, it was your idea for me to watch a movie.
RORY: It was my idea for you to do whatever it took to get your mind off Doyle.
PARIS: So, you're going away, huh? No Huntzberger this weekend?
RORY: Obviously not.
PARIS: You guys were hot and heavy for a couple weeks. What happened?
RORY: Nothing.
PARIS: Feast turned into famine, huh?
RORY: Fine. If you must know, yes. See, Paris, I am not in denial. Logan and I were hot and heavy, had a good two weeks, then it became about voicemails, then crickets. So, yes, he pulled back and I'm going crazy, but I'm not going to stay here and wallow and watch you be all depressed.
PARIS [sitting up suddenly]: You're right.
RORY: About what?
PARIS: About staying here. You should get out, I should get out. This place is poison.
RORY: It is!
PARIS: I don't want to be like this. I want to live my life so that I'll be able to read an in-depth biography about myself in later years, and not puke.
RORY: Good.
PARIS: I'm going to get up and pack, and I am going to have some fun this weekend.
RORY: Good.
[She heads for the door. Paris points at the TV.]
PARIS: How does this end?
RORY: They dance again.
PARIS: Okay.
[Rory leaves. Paris goes into her room.]
LANE'S APARTMENT
[Zach is reading a magazine on the couch. Lane rushes in.]
LANE: Hey, Zach? Grandy's closes at eight tonight, a little early because it's one of his kid's birthdays, but I checked with Luke and he's letting me off at seven, so we've got plenty of time.
ZACH: For what?
LANE: To shop at Grandy's. We set it up last week.
ZACH: We did?
LANE: Yes.
ZACH: Huh. Well, can we go next week?
LANE: Zach, we haven't hit Grandy's in four months. We're completely out of cleaning supplies.
ZACH: Well, I can't go tonight, so just go without me.
LANE: But you love shopping for cleaning supplies.
ZACH: I know, but tonight I've got something to do.
LANE: What?
ZACH: I'm just going to go chill with some friends.
LANE: Who?
ZACH: Well, okay, Officer, I confess. Body's in the trunk.
LANE: Zach.
ZACH: I'm just going to see some old friends. God, what do you want, names and addresses?
LANE: No. Fine. I'll go by myself.
ZACH: Good.
LANE: Good.
ZACH: And don't forget. Get a dishwashing liquid that's gentle on my hands.
LANE: I will.
[Zach pats her hand. She walks away.]



LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory enters the front door.]
RORY: Hello!
LORELAI: Hi! Honey!
RORY: This is okay, right? Springing a surprise visit on you.
LORELAI: This is your definition of surprise? [Laughs.] This is not a surprise. Come on in, I'll show you a surprise.
[They walk into the living room.]
RORY: Paris!
PARIS: I packed my bags and was on the road before I remembered that parents don't own property in the United States anymore.
RORY: Since when?
PARIS: Since the IRS red-foxed my father. The place in Asylum Hill, the Nantucket cottage – even the crack-house in Harlem that we converted into a co-op was sold to one of the q*eer Eye guys.
RORY: Where'd they go?
PARIS: They're going to wire me when they're safe. Anyway, I'm here. Should I leave?
RORY: No, stay. Uh, if it's okay with Mom.
LORELAI: It's okay with me.
RORY: So I guess you can have the couch.
LORELAI: Ah, sorry. That's spoken for.
RORY: What?
[Kirk comes down the stairs behind them.]
KIRK: Hey, Rory. This is a nice surprise.
LORELAI: The Maddis' were supposed to have him tonight. They have goldfish. Kirk's afraid of goldfish.
KIRK: They're always staring at you. All gold and unblinking.
PARIS: I like sleeping on the floor anyway. It's good for my back.
RORY: Okay. Enjoy. Can I, um – [She gestures for Lorelai to follow her.]
LORELAI: Mm-hm.
[They go into Rory's room.]
KIRK [OS]: How do you feel about goldfish?
LORELAI: So, what inspired your visit?
RORY: Just nothing else to do.
LORELAI: Ah, well, don't I feel special.
RORY: Sorry. You know what I mean.
LORELAI: You mean, I love you mommy, I miss you mommy.
RORY: That's what I meant.
LORELAI: So, no parties or anything? No dates?
RORY: No. Just a nice quiet weekend. It's perfect. Oh, wait, you didn't have anything planned with Luke tonight? Don't cancel it on my account.
LORELAI: No, it's okay. He's busy. Taylor's making him drive out to fetch an historical cannonball that Old Man Twickham had lent to his sister in Mystic.
RORY: What would you borrow a cannonball for?
LORELAI: It's been bugging me too.
RORY: Hm. So, how'd your magazine interview go?
LORELAI: Good, I think. I mean, I've never done one before. She didn't stab me with her pencil or anything.
RORY: Good thing.
LORELAI: My interviewer was really cool. Sandra. It was more like friends chatting than being interviewed. She loved the inn, and she asked some good questions, and she loved, loved my Emily stuff.
RORY: Your Emily stuff?
LORELAI: Yeah, she asked me questions about my background. I gave it to her, unplugged.
RORY: You didn't.
LORELAI: She asked.
RORY: But you couched it, right?
LORELAI: What do you mean?
RORY: I mean, you described it in so many words, colorful but unemotional?
LORELAI: I called her the female Pol Pot.
RORY: Mom, you didn't.
LORELAI: She laughed, for like, a minute.
RORY: That's so harsh.
LORELAI: Harsh, but true.
[Kirk stands at the door with his hand over his eyes.]
KIRK: Can I get some water?
LORELAI: Why are you covering your eyes, Kirk?
KIRK: In case you're naked.
LORELAI: You thought I'd walk into my daughter's room and get naked?
KIRK: I don't know your domestic routine.
LORELAI: Glasses are above the sink.
[He leaves the doorway.]
RORY: So you attribute any w*r crimes to Grandma? Any environmental disasters?
LORELAI: What? We were just talking. She won't print any of it.
RORY: Why? Was it off the record?
LORELAI: Yeah. Technically. It wasn't about the inn.
RORY: But did you say ‘it's off the record'?
LORELAI: No.
RORY: Then it's fair game, so she can print all of it.
LORELAI: Including the limerick?
RORY: You did your limerick?
LORELAI: I am very proud of it. I found two dirty words that rhyme with Emily.
RORY: Oh, boy.
LORELAI: Well, can't I call the reporter and tell her it was off the record?
RORY: You can't take things off the record once they're on.
LORELAI: Well, so what? The chances that my mother reads American Travel are extremely slim.
RORY: Yeah. Except for the fact that I told her about it tonight. [She clears her throat.] I needed some small talk.
LORELAI: What, and ‘how are the girls at the club' and ‘ooh, that's gorgeous, is it new' doesn't work anymore? Those are tried and true standbys.
RORY: Well, I told her about it and she jotted down the title. She's going to read it.
LORELAI: Okay, well, you know what? Fine. Let her. It's all true. I'm tired of protecting people. Of being polite, of worrying about other people's feelings. Let her get all Condoleezza Rice to my Barbara Boxer if she wants.
KIRK [OS]: Ow!
LORELAI: Kirk, you can open your eyes!
KIRK [OS]: I'm fine. Ow, my head!
LORELAI: Kirk.
KIRK [OS]: I'm fine! Ow, my toe!
LORELAI [goes into the kitchen]: Kirk!
[We hear a loud crash.]
KIRK [OS]: Oh! My knee!
LORELAI [OS]: Kirk!
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Luke's truck is driving down the street. He brakes for a pedestrian. There is a rolling sound, and then a bang. He pulls up in front of the Twickham house with Taylor in the passenger seat. As he stops, there is another rolling sound and another bang.]
TAYLOR: You were right. We should have tied the cannonball down.
LUKE: Taylor, you don't like to drive after dark, so we didn't have time to tie the cannonball down.
TAYLOR: You didn't have the proper tools to secure it with anyway. Netting, twine –
LUKE: Yes, well, drat my luck. I took all my cannonball securing tools out of my truck just yesterday.
[They get out of the truck and walk around to the back.]
TAYLOR: Must weigh about a hundred pounds.
LUKE: Something like that.
[Taylor notices Dean on the front step of the house.]
TAYLOR: Oh, good. We're in luck. Hey, Dean!
LUKE: No, Taylor, I'll move it myself.
TAYLOR: Luke, don't be headstrong. Once I strained my pecs lifting a birdbath and they were no good to me ever again.
DEAN: What do you need, Taylor?
TAYLOR: Got a big heavy ball here. How are your pecs?
DEAN [pause]: They're fine.
TAYLOR: Help us to the house?
[Luke rolls the ball to the edge of the tailgate, and he and Dean carry it toward the house. Luke notices the look he is getting from Dean.]
LUKE: Look, buddy –
DEAN: Where do you want it, Taylor?
TAYLOR: Uh, on the lawn is fine. We'll put it in place tomorrow morning.
[They set the cannonball down.]
TAYLOR: Lucky you were here.
DEAN: Yeah. Lucky.
[He glares at Luke again, then walks away. Luke rolls his eyes.]
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lane is walking home in the rain carrying bags of cleaning supplies. She sees Zach talking to Sophie outside of the music store. She looks hurt.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – KITCHEN
[She reaches up above the fridge for a box of cereal.]
LORELAI [Calling]: Breakfast!
[Paris comes in from the living room.]
PARIS: Morning.
LORELAI: Morning! Hey, Rory, are you up?
PARIS: She's probably on the phone.
RORY: I'm not on the phone. I'm just getting dressed.
LORELAI: Coffee?
RORY and PARIS: Definitely. Yes.
LORELAI: So, did you get any rest?
PARIS: Kirk talks in his sleep.
LORELAI: Anything juicy?
PARIS: He deals blackjack.
LORELAI: Hm. Kirk?
KIRK [OS]: Yeah?
LORELAI: Turn off the TV, come have your breakfast.
KIRK [OS]: In a minute.
LORELAI: Now.
PARIS: How old is he?
RORY: You'd have to cut him open and count the rings.
KIRK [entering]: Morning.
LORELAI: Morning.
RORY: Morning.
PARIS: You really should see a sleep therapist.
KIRK: Roulette?
PARIS: Blackjack.
KIRK: Sorry. [He sits down.]
LORELAI: Kirk, is the TV still on?
KIRK: Oh, I forgot! [He starts to get up.]
LORELAI: No, no. I'll get it. You'd forget your head if it wasn't screwed on. [She goes into the living room.]
PARIS: Don't deny that you were on the phone.
RORY: Phone's in the living room.
PARIS: Oh, that's your phone? It rang about an hour ago.
RORY [hopeful]: It was ringing?
PARIS: No.
RORY: Knock it off.
KIRK: What are you guys talking about?
[Rory and Paris look at each other, but don't answer.]
KIRK: Fine. [He boxes himself in with the cereal.]
LORELAI: No forts. Now, I don't know what all your plans are, but the grand opening of the Stars Hollow Museum is this morning. Any takers?
PARIS: It's always amusing when provincials grasp for legitimacy. I'm in.
RORY: I wouldn't miss it.
KIRK: I helped build it.
PARIS: Bully.
LORELAI: All right, well, finish up here, grab your jackets and we'll go.
KIRK: I don't need a jacket.
LORELAI: Well, it's chilly, Kirk.
KIRK [whining]: I don't want to wear a jacket.
LORELAI: Well, then, maybe you won't go to the grand opening of the Stars Hollow museum.
KIRK: I'll put on my jacket. [He stomps out of the kitchen.]
LORELAI: Finish your breakfast first. Kirk. Do not turn that TV on.
[We hear cartoons from the living room. Lorelai goes in.]
LORELAI: Kirk! I mean it, Kirk!
TWICKHAM HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Miss Patty is welcoming visitors.]
MISS PATTY: Please enjoy the museum, and come back for some punch. [Rory, Lorelai and Paris are next in line.] Good morning, ladies!
LORELAI: Hi, Patty.
RORY: Hi, Patty.
MISS PATTY [to Paris]: Oh, I remember you! You poor thing.
PARIS: Thanks.
MISS PATTY: It's three dollars each. That includes the punch. Would you like yours now?
LORELAI: Oh, how about later? After I eat a loaf of bread, a pound of crackers and chase it with a quart of olive oil.
MISS PATTY [laughs]: Well, it's not my punch if it's not strong.
LORELAI: Hey, are you guys coming? [She sees Luke and Sookie waiting on the porch.] Oh, looks like we're the first group in.
RORY: I'll catch up. I told Lane I'd meet up with her.
LORELAI: ‘Kay, see you.
RORY: Bye.
[Lorelai joins Luke and Sookie.]
PARIS [to Rory]: How are you doing?
RORY: I'm fine.
PARIS: Doyle's probably called me at the dorm, and my not calling him back means he may never call me again. There you go. There you have it.
RORY: Paris, you've come this far. Don't buckle.
PARIS: I don't want to buckle. I really don't want to buckle. [She pulls her cell phone out of her pocket and hands it to Rory.] Here. Keep it for me.
RORY: Your cell phone? Are you sure?
PARIS: Remove the temptation.
RORY: You got it. There's Lane.
LANE: Hello.
RORY: What's wrong with you?
LANE: I don't want to talk about it.
RORY: Well, we're a fun group.
[Paris passes out cups of Patty's punch.]
RORY: Paris –
PARIS: We paid our three dollars.
RORY: Miss Patty's leftover punch is used to remove tar from construction sites.
PARIS: Then let it remove the tar from our souls.
[They drink.]
TWICKHAM HOUSE – INSIDE
LUKE: Here it is.
LORELAI: Oh, it's nice! You really turned this around fast, huh?
LUKE: Well, it was a team effort.
SOOKIE: Hey look, old letters!
LORELAI: Oh, I love those! [Reading] Letter from Olivia Taft. Reported grand-niece by marriage to president William Taft. Written to Chester Hobart, assumed distant relative to Garret Hobart, vice-president to William McKinley. Wow.
SOOKIE: Oh, I love history. Ooh! Possibly rare 48 star American flag!
LORELAI: Ah, look at that.
LUKE: Oh, someone was supposed to take the Sears tag off of that.
SOOKIE: What's this?
LORELAI [reading]: Civil w*r era cannonball! Ah, where's the cannonball?
[They peer into a roped-off hole in the hardwood.]
LUKE: Flashlights! [He hands them flashlights from a nearby table.]
SOOKIE: I don't see it!
LORELAI: Oh, wait, right there! Right there!
SOOKIE: Ooh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool!
TAYLOR [on overhead speakers]: Ladies and gentlemen. Our audio-visual presentation will commence in five minutes. Five minutes, everybody.
LORELAI: Hey, check out that painting!
LUKE: Oh, yeah, actually that's pretty cool. It's a possible circa nineteenth century portrait of what we think may have been the founder of a school that possibly educated Ben Franklin's cousin.
[Lorelai and Sookie make appreciative noises.]
TWICKHAM HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Rory, Lane and Paris have found a table and chairs and are surrounded by several empty punch glasses. They slur.]
LANE: He just flat out looked out of his face right into my face and said to my face that he was lying.
RORY: Zach said that he was lying?
LANE: No. He lied from his face into my face about where he was going. That's what hurts the most, the lie! Except for seeing him with that woman! That hurts most, more than the lie.
PARIS: You'd think they'd stumble onto the truth. Just accidentally. Say something like two plus two equals four. Just because they say so many things just accidentally, that's like – man!
LANE: I know!
PARIS: They just have to repopulate the species. You know? Just spread it around.
RORY: Oh, they like to spread it around, all right.
PARIS: I bet you Doyle's spreading it right now.
RORY: You don't know that he's spreading it.
PARIS [pointing at her cup]: This – is tasty.
LANE [jumps up suddenly]: I've had it!
RORY: Had what?
LANE: I'm getting to the bottom of this.
PARIS: Spank his bottom!
LANE: He can't do this! We're friends too, as well as lovers if we ever get married! [She storms off.]
PARIS: She walks funny.
RORY: I'm thirsty. This punch makes you thirsty.
PARIS [sighs]: Where is the nearest bathroom?
RORY: No. Paris, no. Stay.
PARIS: I need to go to the bathroom.
RORY: You're going to call Doyle.
PARIS: What? You've got my cell phone.
RORY: We're low-tech here in the Hollow, but we do have payphones.
PARIS: I'm not going to call Doyle.
RORY: Yes you are.
PARIS: I don't even have money on me.
RORY: Uh-huh.
PARIS: Fine. [She takes her shoes and socks off.] Take my shoes, okay? How far can I get without my shoes? Now, bathroom?
RORY [pointing]: Over there.
PARIS: I'll be right back.
RORY: Good.
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Paris walks barefoot to a payphone. A man walks by her.]
PARIS: Excuse me? Could I trouble you for some change? [He keeps walking. To a girl] Excuse me, I just need some change to make a call. Could you – [She ignores Paris.] I just need to make a call!
[She looks around hopelessly.]
TWICKHAM HOUSE – UPSTAIRS
[Luke, Lorelai and Sookie enter a dark room, followed by the rest of the tour group.]
SOOKIE: Where are we going?
LUKE: You'll see.
LORELAI: What is this?
LUKE: You wouldn't want me to spoil it.
TAYLOR'S VOICE [on the intercom]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Stars Hollow dioramic history room presentation. Please stand toward the center of the room, and remember, no talking, no smoking, and please, no lewd behavior of any kind during our presentation.
[Lorelai pinches Luke's butt. He jumps.
LUKE Hey!
LORELAI: I'm just getting the lewd behavior out of the way before the presentation.
TAYLOR'S VOICE: It's the dawn of time. And whether you believe that a Supreme Being created the earth, or in the more and more discredited theory of evolution, one thing's for certain. Early man walked the land we are now on. And while no printed record survived, there's no proof that the first tools weren't invented right here in Stars Hollow.
[Behind them, a mannequin of a caveman is lit up by a spotlight. The caveman is grunting.]
LORELAI: Huh. That wrench is really getting him hot.
[The light goes off on the caveman. She pinches Luke's butt again.]
LUKE: Hey, there's people!
LORELAI: That's half the fun.
TAYLOR'S VOICE: Zooming forward in time to the founding of Stars Hollow. The very first people to live on this land, besides the Indians, was the Jebediah family.
[A light shines on a man, woman, boy, girl, and horse.]
TAYLOR'S VOICE: Good puritans, they were led by the humble Reverend Ezekiel. With him was wife Louisa, daughter Harriet, and young son Joseph, born without speech. I wonder what that first conversation was when they rode up to their new home?
[Lights shine on each member of the family individually as they speak.]
EZEKIEL: Whoa, boy. Good girl. You smell that air, mother?
LOUISA: It smells like home, Ezekiel.
EZEKIEL: Ho, ho, ho, ho. And look at this fertile soil. Just a-wantin' to yield crops.
LOUISA: It smells like home, Ezekiel.
EZEKIEL: But what of the young'uns? What have they to say of their new home?
HARRIET: We can run in the woods, play games, and be schooled at home!
[The light shines on Joseph, in silence for a moment.]
EZEKIEL: Hey! My divining rod is twitching! That means there's water a-plenty.
LOUISA: Better get inside, children, it's time for supper.
HARRIET: Okay, mother. I'm hungry. You hungry, too, Joseph?
[The light shines on Joseph again.]
EZEKIEL: Those stars. So bright. This forest, hollow. What name should I give this place? Hollow. Stars. Hollow. Stars.
[The light goes out on the Jebediah family. After a pause -]
LORELAI: No. Really? They're going to leave us on a cliffhanger?
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lane is walking quickly. She enters Sophie's music store. She walks over to Sophie.]
LANE: Sophie!
SOPHIE: Geez, Lane, I don't have time for coffee right now.
LANE: You owe me an explanation! You – woman!
SOPHIE: What are you talking about?
LANE: You know what I'm talking about. I look to you as a role model. Well, not anymore, except as a role model for heartbreak! I know what you can offer him. You're bohemian, and experienced, familiar with the world of sensual pleasure, champagne, Times Square. I bet you've even smoked a cigarette or two!
SOPHIE: Oh my God, your breath would stop an elephant!
LANE: You've not only been to New York, but you've lived there. You know where the best bagels are and you've been with men. But you don't know him like I know him. It's cheap thrills for you, sister! But I know what cleaning products he likes. Do you?
SOPHIE: I'm not sure how to answer that.
LANE: It had to have been a moment of weakness, because he doesn't like you! He likes me!
SOPHIE: Who?
LANE: Zach!
SOPHIE: Zach?
LANE: Zach!
SOPHIE: Come here.
[Sophie pushes Lane toward the back of the store, where Zach is playing the banjo with a couple of other guys.]
LANE: Zach?
ZACH: Lane!
SOPHIE: Talk! [She leaves them alone.]
LANE: Why are you playing a banjo?
ZACH: It's a bluegrass band, okay? I like bluegrass. I like jamming with these guys, and yes, I like the banjo.
LANE [not making eye contact]: But why didn't you tell me?
ZACH [apologetic]: Because we're rock and roll, Lane. You and me. I was embarrassed. So the guys and I have been jamming on the sly here. Sophie let us. I like the banjo.
LANE: Well, I like the banjo too, when you're playing it.
ZACH: Really?
LANE: Yeah. It's kind of hot.
ZACH: The guys are watching.
LANE: Well, go back to your playing.
ZACH: Cool.
LANE: Oh! And I got three things of Pine-Sol. I've been dying to tell you! But there's been this weird thing between us.
ZACH: Lemon?
LANE: Yeah. Because I know that's what you like.
[They kiss. Zach sits down.]
ZACH: Let's hit it, boys.
[They start to play. Lane turns away, makes a weird face, and walks out.]
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Paris is begging everyone who walks by for change for the phone.]
PARIS: Hey, I need some change here. Come on, damn it! Yeah, keep walking. Keep walking! [She kicks in their direction and blows a raspberry. She runs out into the street after a car.] Hey! Hey, I need fifty cents! Come on! Just fifty cents! Watch it! [She almost gets hit by a car, then runs back onto the sidewalk.] Hey! Give me fifty cents! [The people keep walking.] Fall in a hole! [She blows another raspberry.]
TWICKHAM HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Rory is sitting at the table alone, finishing a cup of punch. She takes her phone out of her pocket and hits a speed-dial number.]
LOGAN'S VOICEMAIL: Hey, it's Logan. Leave whatever message you want. And if this is Finn? Buddy, your voicemail is full! Again! We're meeting at the Starwood, nine-thirty, then just club-hopping from there. There's eleven of us, so bring the Hummer. Don't be more than a half hour late, and erase those stupid messages. [Beep.]
[Rory hangs up suddenly. She starts chugging another glass of punch.]
TWICKHAM HOUSE – UPSTAIRS
[The diorama presentation continues.]
TAYLOR'S VOICE: Sanitation in wartime. No one likes to think about it, but in Stars Hollow that's all we thought about. A local manufacturer, Buff-Rite, was the sole supplier of all things pertaining to sanitation and hygiene for our boys in World w*r two. Remember their snappy theme song?
[The light shines on two deliverymen carrying cardboard boxes labeled ‘Buff-Rite'.]
WOMAN'S VOICE [singing]: Walk light, smell right, head held high with Buff-Rite!
TAYLOR'S VOICE: Closed due to a dramatic drop in demand for its chief products, urinal cakes, the Buff-Rite factory nevertheless afforded hundreds of Stars Hollow residents healthy livelihoods. [Lorelai's cell phone rings.] The Buff-Rite diorama is dedicated –
LORELAI: Sorry, that's me. [She looks at the caller.] Oh, I've got to take this.
LUKE: I'll meet you outside. I've seen enough.
SOOKIE: I can't get enough. [Luke and Lorelai leave. Sookie sings to herself.] Walk light, smell right –
[Multicolored lights flash on two hippies.]
TAYLOR'S VOICE: Remember the sixties? The town of Stars Hollow does! What a headache! A veritable dark age, culminating in a sit-in that gathered over a thousand freaks from the Tri-county area.
[Lorelai stands in a corner by the caveman and answers her phone.]
LORELAI: Hello?
SANDRA: Uh, hi, Lorelai! It's Sandra from American Travel.
LORELAI: Sandra, hi. Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.
SANDRA: No problem, what's up?
LORELAI: Well, I was just thinking about –
SANDRA: Oh, it was great, by the way. Everyone just flipped for it here.
LORELAI: Oh, wonderful. Thank you. But I just wanted to let you know, I think I may have crossed a line with the stuff about my mother?
SANDRA: What? No! It was the best part!
LORELAI: Oh, so it's in the article?
SANDRA: It's not the dominant thing, but it's in. It's great color.
LORELAI: Right. Well, I was wondering if maybe you could lose some of that color. Would that screw things up too much?
SANDRA: Oh, but the stuff about your mother is great! My editor flipped.
LORELAI: Wow. So it's already gone to an editor?
SANDRA: We turn things around pretty quickly.
LORELAI: I guess so. You know, Sandra, I would really like you to cut all the stuff about my mother. Um, it would be a big favour.
SANDRA: I would really rather not. It was a lot of work.
LORELAI: Okay, couldn't you just do a quick re-write, for a friend?
SANDRA: We're not friends.
LORELAI: Oh, right.
SANDRA: Look. It's too late to change it. The only other option we have is pulling it altogether.
LORELAI: Pulling it?
SANDRA: Yeah, and just subbing in something else.
LORELAI: The whole article? The cover and everything?
SANDRA: The whole thing.
LORELAI: Oh.
SANDRA: Look, don't worry about it. It's great. It flies by. The readers are going to love it, okay?
LORELAI: Okay, sure. Thanks for calling me back. Bye.
MAN'S VOICE: I'm sure looking forward to work today!
WOMAN'S VOICE: Haley, put your Etch-a-Sketch away and come sit down.
[Lorelai joins Sookie.]
LORELAI: What's this?
SOOKIE: Modern life in Stars Hollow.
[The light is shining on a family around a breakfast table. The mother is standing at the stove.]
MAN: Great breakfast, mother.
BOY: Yeah, you've done it again, mom!
WOMAN: I just love serving breakfast to my family.
GIRL: And I love Jesus!
TWICKHAM HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Taylor hurries down the steps, looking thrilled. He finds Luke on the sidewalk.]
TAYLOR: Look at these clamouring crowds, partner!
LUKE: Yeah, people seem to be having a good time.
TAYLOR: It was a rush job, but spectacular. It's more than I thought it would be.
LUKE: Oh, way more.
TAYLOR: I'm seriously considering going permanent with this.
LUKE: What?
TAYLOR: Well, I think we've got something here. Something big. A two-month run isn't enough! We've at least got to hold it over through the summer!
LUKE: Taylor –
TAYLOR: I'm thinking we should keep it open for at least a year. Even if it doesn't make money. At that point, we've got the publicity. We've made the guidebooks. My God! We'll have a Cooperstown-type attraction on our hands!
LUKE: Taylor, no!
TAYLOR: What?
LUKE: Are you blind? This place is a piece of crap!
TAYLOR: What? A piece of –
LUKE: Look at it! The old man's stuff – it's not even historical! It's all a bunch of stuff that may have belonged to people who may have distantly related to people who may have been historically meaningful! And the diorama
–
TAYLOR: Well, I'll admit, it's a little rough –
LUKE: It's a joke.
TAYLOR: Luke, I don't get it. You helped build this! You were so co-operative! Why are you turning on it like this? Turning on me?
LUKE: I want the house.
TAYLOR: What?
LUKE: I want this house, Taylor. All my life I've loved this house. They don't build them like this anymore. I mean, you saw the banisters, right?
TAYLOR: Well, yeah, but –
LUKE: No. I've always said to myself if you're going to have a family and buy a house, then it's got to be this house.
TAYLOR: Oh –
LUKE: It's why I volunteered, okay? I got involved with this whole thing to stay close to the house and keep on your good side. You had the control.
TAYLOR: I should have known that you were doing this for selfish reasons.
LUKE: Taylor, look. I know you don't like me, I can't change that. But I've got to be honest here. This museum is not going to make it. This property, these expenses, the taxes, the upkeep. I mean, the floor broke through from just the cannonball. It's going to take money. Do you want to keep a money loser on the books? Do you want that to be your legacy in Stars Hollow? Because that's what this is, Taylor. It's a money pit.
TAYLOR: Well, I don't want a money pit on the books.
LUKE: Just keep it open for the two months, then sell it to me. I'll give you the best price, I swear.
TAYLOR: A family. You mean, you and Lorelai –
LUKE: Me and – whoever. Yeah.
TAYLOR: Huh. Well, I'll think about it.
[Luke nods and smiles as Taylor returns inside.]
TWICKHAM HOUSE – BACK DOOR
[Lorelai and Sookie exit.]
LORELAI: We have got to bring everyone we know to this thing immediately, before the Nederlanders swoop in and whisk it away to Broadway.
SOOKIE: And at three bucks a pop. That crappy Epis show costs a hundred bucks.
LORELAI: I've got to make a quick call, maybe we'll go through again.
SOOKIE [gasps]: Once is not enough!
[Sookie goes ahead. Lorelai sighs and dials a number on her cell phone.]
LORELAI: Sandra, hi. It's Lorelai Gilmore, again. Listen, I was thinking, I think you should just pull the article. Yeah, I'm sure. But thanks. Okay. Bye.
[She hangs up. Luke joins her on the sidewalk.]
LUKE: So, was it all I said it would be?
LORELAI: Oh, and more! I've got to go through with Rory, have you seen her anywhere?
LUKE: Haven't seen her, no.
LORELAI: Wow.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: I just never really looked at this place before. Those columns, and that brick.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: It's beautiful.
LUKE: Yeah. It's a great house.
[Rory comes up behind them.]
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Aw, Rory, honey, what's wrong?
RORY: I don't feel good. I really don't feel good.
LORELAI: I think I can, uh, guess why. Come on, let's get you home.
LUKE: You need help? Want me to drive?
LORELAI: It's okay, it's just five minutes. Come on.
[Rory and Lorelai leave. Luke walks toward a table on the side of the house, and packs up his toolbox. Dean walks by, giving him attitude.]
LUKE: Okay, Dean. Come on. Give me that attitude. What's up? What is this, still about the Pippi night? The Bop-it? Fine. You hate me, whatever. You want to punch me? Go ahead, I'm a terrible guy, I deserve it. Go ahead, take a sh*t. I won't even fight back. Make you feel better, huh, buddy?
DEAN: Just go back to your girlfriend.
LUKE: Fine. Whatever.
DEAN [mumbles]: While you've got one.
LUKE: What's that supposed to mean?
DEAN: What do you think it means?
LUKE: I'm not playing games here!
DEAN: Your situation is no different from mine. Buddy.
LUKE: I've got work to do.
DEAN: Then go. They want more than this. Don't you see that? And all you are is this.
LUKE: Rory was a kid, Dean. She grew up. She moved on. Accept it.
DEAN: You accept it. This town, it's all you are, and it's not enough. She's going to get bored, and you can't take her anywhere. You're here forever.
LUKE: It's different.
DEAN: It's not different. You and me. Same thing.
[Luke stares after him as he walks away.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – BATHROOM
[Rory is lying on Lorelai's lap on the floor. She is crying.]
RORY: Why doesn't he like me? Why doesn't he call me? What did I do?
LORELAI: Sh, honey, it's okay. It's okay.
RORY: Logan – [she breaks off into a sob.]
LORELAI: Sh, it's okay.

LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory wakes up on the bathroom floor. Downstairs, Paris sit at the table with her head in her hands, and Kirk limps in and joins her, sighing.]
PARIS: Founder's Day punch?
KIRK: Abba Zabbas.
[Lorelai comes in the side door, extremely perky. She is carrying several paper bags.]
LORELAI: Good morning Vietnam! How's everyone feeling today?
[Kirk and Paris groan.]
LORELAI: Terrific! Okay, I got tacos, hard tacos, I got soft tacos, I got fries, curly, straight, and spicy -
PARIS: Are you serious?
LORELAI: Trust me. It's the best hangover food on the east coast.
KIRK: You get a Mars bar? You know, hare to the dog?
LORELAI: Ah, there's pop tarts in the cabinet, Kirk. Coffee'll be up in a minute, grab some water and start hydrating!
[Rory wanders in.]
PARIS: The smell of these tacos is making me nauseous.
LORELAI: No, no, no. That's the quart of Patty's non-FDA-approved Founder's Day punch you drank last night. Eat a taco.
RORY: Oh, thank God, hangover food.
LORELAI: That's my little college girl.
RORY: Tito's was open this early?
LORELAI: Well, it was for me.
RORY: The power you have over fast food owners is astonishing.
PARIS [mouth full of taco]: Oh, God. I think I'm going to throw up. [Pause] No. I'm good.
RORY: By the way, thanks for leaving me on the bathroom floor all night.
LORELAI: Uh, hey, I tried to get you up. You actually used your foot to stop me.
RORY: I did?
LORELAI: Yes. It was very House of Flying Daggers, but with vomiting.
RORY: Sorry. I don't remember that. The foot part. The vomiting part, however -
PARIS: Stop saying the word 'vomiting'. Unless you want a Mr. Creosote situation on your hands here.
[Rory makes a disgusted face and walks into the living room. Lorelai follows her with a bag of tacos.]
KIRK: Oh, man. I think I got a cavity. I got to stop partying like this.
LIVING ROOM
[Rory stands in the middle of the room, looking around, confused.]
LORELAI: What are you looking for?
RORY: My book bag.
LORELAI: I believe it's in your room.
RORY: Room?
LORELAI: That way.
RORY: Right.
LORELAI: Hey. [She directs Rory to the couch.] I got you a beef burrito. I thought it might be too hardcore for the amateurs in the kitchen, but I figured you'd appreciate it.
RORY: Thanks. [They sit.]
LORELAI: So, how are you feeling?
RORY: I've been better.
LORELAI: Yeah. You take aspirin?
RORY: Aspirin?
LORELAI: White pill, big 'A' on it.
RORY: Right, yep.
LORELAI: Oh, here, before I forget. Um, this fell out of your pocket last night while you were pulling an Exorcist.
RORY [takes the cell phone]: Mm. Paris gave it to me to hold so she wouldn't call Doyle.
LORELAI: She was the talk of the town this morning. Attacked the pretzel cart, police backup had to be called for the first time ever.
RORY: She was quite a mess.
LORELAI: Huh. So apparently it was a theme.
RORY: I am sorry. It won't happen again, believe me.
LORELAI: You, of all people, should know the dangers of the Founder's Day punch. Did you learn nothing from Mommy's Coyote Ugly bar dance at last year's Salute to the Quakers festival?
RORY: Oh, now, you can't blame that all on the punch.
LORELAI: Well, don't get me wrong, I'm always up for a little mother-daughter bonding, but seriously. When did facials go out of style?
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: I just don't like seeing you like that.
RORY: That makes two of us.
LORELAI: So, what was all that stuff you were babbling on about last night?
RORY: What stuff?
LORELAI: About Logan. Things aren't going so well with the two of you, huh?
RORY: I'm going to get some coffee.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: I know. Kitchen, that way.
[She gets up and leaves Lorelai on the couch. Lorelai looks hurt.]
OPENING CREDITS
YALE DORMS - LOGAN'S COMMON ROOM
[Logan is sitting, reading the paper. There is a knock on his door. He gets up. It's Rory.]
LOGAN: Well, this is a surprise.
RORY: Can I come in?
LOGAN: Sure. You want to sit down?
RORY: Nope. Got to stay vertical.
[Logan stares at her.]
RORY: What?
LOGAN: You have, like, an octagon imprinted on your face.
RORY: I can't do this anymore Logan.
LOGAN: Do what?
RORY: This casual dating thing. I don't like it. It's not who I am and I don't want to make it who I am.
LOGAN: Whoa, hold on here. Where's this coming from?
RORY: It's coming from me. The ravishing creature standing in front of you.
LOGAN: We talked about this.
RORY: I know.
LOGAN: I didn't make you do this.
RORY: I know. I'm not accusing you of anything. This isn't your fault.
LOGAN: I don't understand. I thought everything was going so well.
RORY: What are you talking about? I haven't heard from you in a week.
LOGAN: I was busy. I had some friends in town, and -
RORY: You know what? It doesn't matter. You're not my boyfriend, you don't owe me any explanations. I just don't want to be one of the many anymore.
LOGAN: Oh, Rory, come on!
[Logan's roommate comes out.]
LANNY: Hey, Logan, Cassandra's on the phone.
LOGAN: Take a message.
LANNY: She's got a great accent. Where's she from?
LOGAN: Lanny! Message!
LANNY: Fine. Relax, man. Geez.
[He goes back into his room.]
RORY: Go call Cassandra back. We're done here.
LOGAN: How are we done here?
RORY: I said everything I have to say.
LOGAN: Which is what?
RORY: I'm a girlfriend girl, Logan. I have boyfriends, not escorts.
LOGAN: Ah. [He starts pacing.]
RORY: I thought I could be different, but I can't. I'm sorry. Maybe we can just go back to being friends again.
LOGAN [mad]: Or maybe we can become boyfriend and girlfriend, right?
RORY: What?
LOGAN: I get it. I get what you're doing.
RORY: I'm not doing anything.
LOGAN: Hey, if that's what you want then just come out and say it. But you coming in here and issuing an ultimatum -
RORY: I am not issuing an ultimatum!
LOGAN: That's not what I heard.
RORY: I said let's be friends!
LOGAN: That's not what you meant!
RORY [moans]: I need a taco!
LOGAN [crosses over to her]: All right, fine. I'll do it.
RORY: Do what?
LOGAN: I'll be your boyfriend.
RORY: You can't be my boyfriend.
LOGAN: Why not?
RORY: Because you told me that you can't be my boyfriend.
LOGAN: If I say I can, then I can.
RORY: You have a hundred girls on speed dial. You keep a second bathrobe in your closet for overnight guests.
LOGAN: That's all beside the point. You came in here to say you were unhappy with the situation, right?
RORY: Right.
LOGAN: Fine. I've rectified the situation. Problem solved.
RORY: No. Problem not solved.
LOGAN: Hey. If I say I can do this, I can do this!
[There is a knock at the door. Logan opens it.]
GIRL: Hey Logan. Thought maybe I could get you to buy me some lunch.
LOGAN: Oh, geez -
RORY: I'm sorry. Could you excuse us for just a second? We're almost done here.
GIRL: Sure. I'll just wait out here.
[Logan closes the door.]
RORY: So the Swedish flight attendants should be here any minute.
LOGAN: I swear this situation has never happened to me before in my life.
RORY: Logan -
LOGAN: Rory. Do you really want to stop seeing me?
RORY: No, but I can't -
LOGAN: 'Cause I don't want to stop seeing you.
RORY: Okay, but -
LOGAN: So then just accept what I'm saying. I like trying new things. It's new, it's different, but I can do it.
RORY: Are you sure?
[Logan grabs her and kisses her.]
RORY: Well, I know you can do that, but -
[He kisses her again.]
RORY: I really want to believe you.
LOGAN: Then believe me. We're starting fresh right now, new beginning. So you want to go grab some lunch? We'll hammer out the details.
RORY: I should probably change first.
LOGAN: Go home, change. I'll pick you up in half an hour.
RORY [smiles]: Okay.
[They kiss and laugh.]
LOGAN: See how good this is going so far? I think I'm going to be an excellent boyfriend.
RORY: I agree. Now do you want to go tell her, or should I?
LOGAN: Oh, crap. I'll be right back.
[He goes outside. Rory smiles.]
YALE DORMS - RORY AND PARIS' ROOM
[Paris enters, carrying her bags from the weekend. She goes into her room and turns on the light. Doyle is asleep in her bed.]
PARIS: Doyle?
DOYLE: Hey.
PARIS: What are you doing here?
DOYLE: I'm dying.
PARIS: What do you mean, you're dying?
DOYLE: I got sick. And then my very concerned roommates kicked me out because they have exams.
PARIS: Oh my God.
DOYLE: I didn't know where to go, so I came here. I called you first.
PARIS: I was gone this weekend.
DOYLE: So I just came by. I thought I'd wait till you got back, then I fell asleep.
PARIS: You've been here all weekend?
DOYLE: Uh huh.
PARIS: I thought you were avoiding me.
[Doyle coughs pathetically.]
PARIS: I'm sorry you're sick.
DOYLE: It feels like bees are buzzing in my head. Feel it.
PARIS: What?
DOYLE: Feel my head.
PARIS: Why?
DOYLE: I just want you to know how hot I am.
PARIS [backing away]: Well, when you're hot, you're hot and when you're not, you're not. That's how the song goes. Just follow the song.
DOYLE: What?
PARIS: I just don't see what putting my hand on your head is going to get you.
DOYLE: It's just -
PARIS: I'm not a shaman, Doyle. I don't have healing powers.
DOYLE: Where are you going?
PARIS: I'll be right back.
[She closes the door.]
DRAGONFLY INN
[Michel is at the front desk.]
MICHEL: Hold on a second. [Lorelai approaches.] It's for you. It's Sookie. She's done with her doctor's appointment.
LORELAI: Oh, she say how she is?
MICHEL: Mm, to someone who may have asked her, I'm sure she would have.
LORELAI: Mm-hm. [She takes the phone.] Hey, Sookie.
[Scene cuts from the inn to Sookie's house.]
SOOKIE: The bastard put me on bed rest.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Dr. Menck. He told me to lie down immediately and not to get up again until little Cherry or Norric comes out.
LORELAI: Oh. Well, we'll get to the names in a second. So, are you serious about the bed rest? Where are you?
SOOKIE: I'm at home, on the couch!
LORELAI: Are you okay?
SOOKIE: No, I'm not okay! I have a dinner to get out.
LORELAI: Well, honey, I think we're going to have to do that without you.
SOOKIE: But how?
LORELAI: Well, we have a kitchen staff, and you just tell me what still needs to be done, and we will handle it.
SOOKIE: Okay. Get a pencil.
LORELAI: Okay. Pencil in hand.
SOOKIE: You need to grate six carrots and four parsnips, and then take some flour and butter, melt the butter, make a roux.
LORELAI: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: Uh, baby, you lost me at carrots. Which, uh, by the way, was the first draft of 'you had me at hello'.
SOOKIE: You had me at what? What are you talking about?
LORELAI: Oh, sorry. I see we've entered the no humor zone. Look, just relax. I'm going to take care of everything.
SOOKIE: But the ducks.
LORELAI: The ducks will be fine. They're lying in a pan with their heads chopped off, so the worst part is behind them. Now, don't worry. Go rest, and I'll check in with you later.
SOOKIE: But -
LORELAI: Happy hibernating!
[She hangs up.]
MICHEL: No Sookie?
LORELAI: No Sookie. Come on.
[Michel follows her into the kitchen.]
LORELAI: Okay, now tell me who does what, and what we need to keep things running.
MICHEL: Well, we need Sookie here.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, she's not going to be here, so let's go to plan B.
MICHEL: Okay, plan B. That involves Sookie's clone, also named Sookie.
LORELAI: Well, um, who here makes the sauces?
MICHEL: Sookie.
LORELAI: Who here, Michel?
MICHEL: Sookie trusts no one else with the sauces. She makes the sauces.
LORELAI: Well, what does Mark make?
MICHEL: Salads.
LORELAI: Okay, and Donny does desserts. What do our other guys do?
MICHEL: Well, that man over there does the cleaning. That man over there dresses the plates, that man uses tongs, and I have no idea what that man in the corner does. But I would check his trunk before he leaves.
LORELAI: Without Sookie here, we have salads and desserts?
MICHEL: Pretty much.
LORELAI: We can't run a restaurant serving just salads and desserts!
MICHEL: I would not go to eat, no.
LORELAI: Wait, okay. Here we have duck. Um, who here does the duck?
MICHEL: Nobody touches the ducks.
LORELAI: Well, starting now, someone has to touch the ducks!
MICHEL: I do not know what to tell you, except that it will not be me.
LORELAI [sighs]: This is bad, Michel.
MICHEL: I'm getting that, yes.
LORELAI: Well, we'll just figure something out, right?
MICHEL: Absolutely. Ain't no mountain high enough.
LORELAI: We'll just, um, formulate a plan, nail down a strategy. You have any ideas?
MICHEL: We could order some pizza, or Chinese food, or perhaps one of those hoagies that you cut into a million pieces -
LORELAI: No more suggestions necessary, Michel.
MICHEL: Well, I'm here if you need me.
[He walks out.]
LUKE'S DINER
[The phone rings. Luke answers it.]
LUKE: Luke's!
[Scene cuts between the Dragonfly kitchen and Luke's.]
LORELAI: How pretty do you think I am?
LUKE: Are we using a specific day? Have you had a good night's sleep?
LORELAI: Sookie's doctor put her on immediate bed rest, and I thought it would be fine, but no one will touch the ducks, and Michel wants to order a hoagie, and I am starting to hyperventilate and I'm not wearing a stretchy fabric, and -
LUKE: I'll be right there.
[He hangs up.]
YALE CAMPUS
[Rory and Logan walk together.]
LOGAN: How's that headache of yours?
RORY: Subsiding a little. The mashed potato, mac and cheese, biscuit, gravy plate combo really helped a lot.
LOGAN: I have to say, half the fun in being with you is the horrified looks on the waiters' faces.
RORY: Please. I'm an amateur compared to my mother.
LOGAN: So what do you think? You up for a movie?
RORY: Oh, yeah. Something really bad.
LOGAN: Absolutely. Let's check the paper and see if Rob Schneider's still employable.
[They laugh.]
LOGAN'S DORM
[Logan enters, followed by Rory.]
LOGAN: I think I have a paper over -
HONOR: Well! Look how long you make a girl wait for you!
LOGAN: Honor!
[The blond girl is sitting on the couch. Logan is very excited to see her.]
HONOR: Do you really think you're worth it?
LOGAN: What are you doing here?
HONOR: Apparently begging for some affection!
[She gets up and they hug. Rory does not look impressed.]
HONOR: It is so good to see you.
LOGAN: You too!
RORY: Listen, Logan. Maybe I should go.
LOGAN: What? Oh, sorry, God. Rory, this is my sister Honor. Honor, Rory Gilmore.
RORY [relaxes]: Sister? Really? Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you.
HONOR: It's nice to meet you too.
RORY: Hey, your sister's here. Cool.
LOGAN: So, what's the occasion?
HONOR: Well, I had to see you, and since you never check your email I had to drag myself down and beg Lanny to let me in so I could show you this! [She holds up her hand to display a ring.]
LOGAN: Holy! [They hug again.]
HONOR: It happened last night!
LOGAN: Oh, Josh finally gave in, uh?
HONOR: Oh, stop it. He's lucky I ever looked at him in the first place.
LOGAN: Well, congratulations.
HONOR: Listen. I need a favor. I'm going to tell them tomorrow night and I need you there for support.
LOGAN: Come on.
HONOR: Hey. I backed you up when you wanted to take a year off school and sail around the world. I wired you the money when you sunk the yacht. I helped pay off the Indonesian Coast Guard!
LOGAN: Okay, okay! I'll be there.
HONOR: Oh, thank you! I love you, I love you, I love you. Okay. Now I can breathe. And focus on - [she turns to Rory] - you. Hi. [She laughs.]
RORY: Hi.
HONOR: Okay, I'm totally blanking. Your name is?
RORY: Rory. Rory Gilmore.
LOGAN: Yeah, Rory's my [pause] girlfriend.
[Honor turns to look at him, amused.]
RORY: You okay over there? You need a little water, or a time machine?
HONOR: I'm sorry, did you say girlfriend?
LOGAN: Yes.
RORY: It's new.
HONOR [laughs]: Oh, my God! I've never heard him call anyone his girlfriend before. Well, Alyssa Milano, but he was ten and in a weird Who's the Boss phase.
LOGAN: Oh, wow, time flies when you're getting pushed out the door.
HONOR: Okay, I'm sorry. Listen, you must come to dinner too.
RORY: Oh, um -
HONOR: No. Really, come. Please come. It'll make it more festive and distracting.
LOGAN: We'll see.
HONOR: Okay, fine. I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow night. Please don't be late?
LOGAN: I promise.
[They hug.]
HONOR: Bye, Rory.
RORY: Bye!
[Honor leaves.]
LOGAN: And that is my sister.
RORY: I like her!
LOGAN: Yeah, she's cool!
RORY: Listen, you do not have to take me to dinner tomorrow. It's a family thing, I totally understand.
LOGAN: No, you should come.
RORY: Logan.
LOGAN: Hey. Boyfriends bring their girlfriends to their family's houses for dinner. It's natural.
RORY: How would you know?
LOGAN: I saw it on Who's the Boss. Now, let's find that paper.
[Rory hands him the paper.]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Lorelai leads Luke into the kitchen.]
LORELAI: So, there's the fridge, stove's over there, grill's on the side, freezer's in the back. That's salad man, plate guy, tongs guy, check-his-trunk-before-he-leaves guy, and here are the ducks. Are you familiar with ducks?
LUKE: I am familiar with ducks.
LORELAI: But, I mean, not just familiar, like you know what a duck is. I mean, have you cooked a duck before?
LUKE: I can handle the ducks. Relax.
LORELAI: Okay. Ducks handled. Good.
LUKE: Now, does Sookie have a menu notes, or, uh -
[Manny hands Luke a binder.]
LUKE: Oh, thanks, uh -
MANNY: Me llamo Manny.
LUKE: Manny. Gracias, Manny.
LORELAI: I talked to Sookie, she said everything you need is in that folder, it's a little unorganized.
LUKE: Well, it wouldn't be Sookie's fault if it wasn't a little unorganized.
LORELAI: Okay, so what can I do to help?
LUKE: Nothing.
LORELAI: Ah. Perfect answer.
LUKE: Not without a hairnet.
LORELAI: Okay. I'll be out there if you need me.
[Lorelai leaves the kitchen.]
YALE DORMS - PARIS' BEDROOM
[Paris enters, followed by her nanny.]
PARIS: He's right there.
DOYLE: What's going on?
PARIS: I'm taking care of you.
DOYLE: You're - [Nanny forces Doyle to sit up and takes off his shirt.] Hey!
PARIS: This is Nanny. She only speaks Portuguese.
DOYLE: What's Portuguese for 'Ow, you're ripping my chest hair out'?
[Nanny speaks Portuguese very fast.]
PARIS: Clean shirt. Got it.
DOYLE: What's she doing? What's that jar? She's got salve! She's got salve! [He struggles as Nanny rubs the salve on his chest.]
PARIS: Doyle, relax. Nanny took care of me for years.
DOYLE: Oh, God. Do you remember when Han Solo finds Luke Skywalker in the snowstorm and he cuts open their dead Taun-taun to hide inside? That's what I smell like at this moment.
PARIS: She makes that balm herself. I'm telling you, it's magic.
DOYLE: Paris, no offense to Nanny and her magic healing balm, but when I came over here I thought you would take care of me.
PARIS: I am taking care of you. I brought you Nanny.
[Nanny dresses him in a clean t-shirt and forces him back down.]
DOYLE: I don't want Nanny. I'm scared of Nanny. Can't you just take it from here?
PARIS: No.
DOYLE: Why?
PARIS: Sick people freak me out.
DOYLE: You're pre-med!
[Nanny says something.]
DOYLE: Paris -
PARIS: Lie down! You'll feel better soon, I promise!
[Nanny packs her bag and leaves the room. Doyle whimpers.]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Luke and the staff are busy preparing dinner. The phone rings.]
MANNY: Cocina. Sí, aquí esta. Luke, Sookie.
LUKE: Hey, Sookie.
[Scene cuts from the kitchen to Sookie's living room, where she is sitting on the couch.]
SOOKIE: Hi.
LUKE: Hi.
SOOKIE: Whatcha doing?
LUKE: I'm cooking.
SOOKIE: Right, good. Little test. So, I was just checking in, making sure everything was fine.
LUKE: Everything is fine.
SOOKIE: The ducks working out for you?
LUKE: The ducks are selling like hotcakes.
SOOKIE [giggles]: Like hotcakes. God, you are a funny guy! I just, I never realized. So, I just wanted to tell you that I'm really grateful to you for jumping in like this.
LUKE: Happy to jump.
SOOKIE: Are you straining the sauce?
LUKE: Excuse me?
SOOKIE: The duck sauce. Are you straining it?
LUKE: Yes.
SOOKIE: Twice?
LUKE: No.
SOOKIE: Oh, well. It's really best if you strain it twice. It makes it really smooth.
LUKE: People seem to be liking the sauce, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Well, sure, when you don't know what you're missing, then -
LUKE: Okay, tell you what. From now on, I will strain the duck sauce twice. Three times, if it'll make you happy.
SOOKIE: No! Then it'll be too runny!
LUKE: Twice it is.
SOOKIE: Thank you.
LUKE: You're welcome. [Lorelai enters the kitchen. To Lorelai] Hey. I've got Sookie on the phone, do you need to talk to her?
LORELAI: Yes, actually. Great.
LUKE [to Sookie]: I'm handing you over to Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hey.
SOOKIE [upset]: He's not straining the duck sauce three times, is he?
LORELAI: Uh, not to my knowledge. Hey, Sookie, where are the applications?
SOOKIE: I don't know why you'd joke about a thing like that. Three times! That's not funny!
LORELAI: Sookie, the applications, from the culinary institute, for your temporary replacement?
SOOKIE: Are they not there?
LORELAI: Uh, depends on where 'there' is.
SOOKIE: Huh. They're around somewhere. Check the freezer. Sometimes I like to read in there.
LORELAI: That's very Lucy of you. I'll call when I find them. Now rest. Bye.
SOOKIE: Bye.
[They hang up.]
LORELAI: You know, I love watching you cook. It's hot.
LUKE: That's because you're standing right next to the broiler.
LORELAI: Oh, is that what we're calling it now?
LUKE: Not in front of the guys, please.
LORELAI: Fine. I'll save my dirty cooking jokes for later.
[Lorelai leaves the kitchen.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai enters, talking on her cell phone.]
LORELAI: Yeah, I was just wondering if I could get you to re-submit those applications. [Pause] Well, we seem to have misplaced them. As soon as possible would be great. [She hears a noise from the kitchen. She looks concerned.] Uh-huh. You can just fax them over, that'd be great. Thanks. Bye.
[She hangs up, and looks around for something to defend herself with. She grabs a cushion from the couch.]
LORELAI: Hello, is somebody there?
RORY [walking from her room into the kitchen]: Hey, Mom!
LORELAI [sighs]: Hey, Mom? That's it? You just gave me a heart attack and all you have to say is 'hey, Mom'? I thought you were a vicious serial k*ll.
RORY [getting a soda from the fridge]: Who you were going to challenge to a pillow fight?
LORELAI: What are you doing here, Sassy McSassterson?
RORY: I needed some stuff.
LORELAI: What stuff?
RORY: My blue dress.
LORELAI: What do you need your blue dress for?
RORY: Okay. I am going to tell you something. But when I do, you cannot say a word.
LORELAI: Why not?
RORY: Because I don't want to hear it.
LORELAI: Hear what?
RORY: What you're going to say.
LORELAI: But how do you know what I'm going to say?
RORY: Trust me. I know.
LORELAI: Hey, I have been known to say some very surprising things. 'Hugh, I know you're with Elizabeth Hurley, but how about picking up a hooker tonight?' That was me.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Okay, fine.
RORY: Logan and I are now boyfriend and girlfriend. And I am here because I need my blue dress. To wear to his parents' house tonight.
[She nods, picks up her soda and walks into her bedroom. Lorelai follows her, looking like she desperately wants to say something.]
RORY: I went over to Logan's apartment yesterday. I told him that I didn't want to do the casual dating thing anymore. That it wasn't me, and we should just go back to being friends. Instead, he decided to commit.
LORELAI: A -
RORY: Not a word. Now I know that things may have started off a little rocky - [Lorelai starts to say something else] Ah, ah, ah. But I am very happy with the way things are going and I think that, in time, you will be too.
[Lorelai holds the cushion up to her mouth. Rory picks up the garment bag containing her dress.]
RORY: Okay, I have everything I need. I have to get going. Logan's picking me up at six. It was nice talking to you. Don't forget to breathe.
[She kisses Lorelai's head and leaves.]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Luke and the staff are cooking.]
LUKE [tasting]: Good, add the parsley and get it out there. [The phone rings. He answers. ] Kitchen!
SOOKIE: Do you put walnuts in your béchamel?
LUKE: Sookie?
SOOKIE [forceful]: Do you put walnuts in your béchamel?
LUKE: No.
SOOKIE: You don't put walnuts in your béchamel.
LUKE: Sookie, I have things burning, so –
SOOKIE: I thought I tasted walnuts. What things are you burning?
LUKE: What do you mean, you tasted walnuts?
SOOKIE: You want to get fancy, you can do that at your own diner. My béchamel sauce is classic.
LUKE: How are you tasting the béchamel?
SOOKIE: And I don't remember including goat cheese in the fennel salad!
LUKE: How do you know what's in the fennel salad?
SOOKIE: So you admit it. You put goat cheese in the fennel salad.
LUKE: Yeah, I put goat cheese in the fennel salad. It goes good in the fennel salad and you had it sitting there.
SOOKIE: And I also have some Brill-o pads sitting there. You want to toss a couple of those into the fennel salad as well? Hm?
LUKE: How do you know all this?
SOOKIE: I just assumed.
LUKE: You just assumed I put goat cheese in the fennel salad.
SOOKIE: And walnuts in the béchamel.
LUKE: I did not put walnuts in the béchamel. Sookie, are you having people bring you my food? [Sookie doesn't respond.] You are! You're calling here and having people sneak food out from behind my back so that you can taste
it.
SOOKIE: Wow. You paranoid or what? Geez, man, time for a vacation.
[One of the kitchen staff enters the kitchen with an empty take-out container.]
LUKE: Hold on. [To the whole kitchen] Okay, here's the deal. Announcement, please. From this moment on there will be no more food leaving the premises. The food goes from here to the dining room, or upstairs, and that is it. No more food will leave the premises. No quiero que g*n comida salga de esta local. ¿Comprende?
[The staff agrees.]
LUKE [to Sookie]: What about you, you comprende?
SOOKIE: That's my kitchen, Luke!
LUKE: And it will be here waiting for you when you get back. Until then, sit back, relax, and watch Ellen dance around a little. I got work to do.
SOOKIE: Luke!
LUKE: Bye-bye.
[Sookie hangs up, frustrated.]
YALE DORMS – RORY'S COMMON ROOM
[Rory enters carrying her dress. Paris is in the kitchen.]
RORY: Hey, Paris.
PARIS: Hey, Rory.
[Rory walks into her room and is surprised to see Nanny making her bed.]
RORY: Oh!
NANNY: Oh, I scare?
RORY: No. Yes! Excuse me.
[She walks back into the common room.]
RORY: There's a woman in my room?
PARIS: That's Nanny. You know Nanny. That makes me sad, that you don't remember Nanny. She always liked you.
RORY: She's stripping my bed. Why is she doing that?
PARIS: Well, she finally got Doyle to sleep, and she has to do something. The woman doesn't tire. She's a machine.
RORY: What do you mean, she finally got Doyle to sleep?
PARIS: He's here. He's sick, so Nanny's taking care of him.
RORY: Why aren't you doing it?
PARIS: Sick people freak me out.
RORY: You're pre-med!
PARIS: I'm really tired of having that constantly thrown in my face.
RORY: Paris, could you please just get Nanny out of my room, ‘cause I have dinner with Logan tonight and I have to get ready.
PARIS: Logan? I thought you guys were –
RORY: We were.
PARIS: What happened?
RORY: Well, I told him that I didn't think things were working and that we should just be friends, but he didn't want to be just –
PARIS: Friends?
RORY: No. It seemed to wake him up. So now he wants to give commitment a try.
PARIS: A commitment? With Logan?
RORY: Yep.
PARIS: I don't believe it! You did it, you landed the whale. You're Annette Bening.
RORY: I'm not Annette Bening. It was just a matter of getting him to focus on the situation.
PARIS: Focus. Huh.
[Nanny walks out of Rory's room carrying an armload of shoes. She speaks in Portuguese to Paris.]
PARIS: She's going to buff your shoes.
RORY: I need these. [She grabs a pair from the top of the pile and heads back into her room with the dress.]
RORY [OS]: My God, my room is clean!
[Paris smirks and stirs her coffee.]
HUNTZBERGER MANSION
[Rory and Logan get out of his car in front of a massive house.]
RORY: Wow!
LOGAN: Uh, where are my keys? What did I do with my keys?
RORY: Just your parents live here?
LOGAN: Ah, got ‘em. [He pulls the keys from the ignition.]
RORY: Well, I certainly hope the drainage is good.
LOGAN: Excuse me?
RORY: Because if it's not good and you have pooling somewhere, you may not know it for months.
LOGAN: I'll be sure to mention that to them.
RORY: You look nervous.
LOGAN: Do I? Huh. I'm just not so sure what I got you into.
RORY: What do you mean?
LOGAN: Well, my family's not going to take my sister's engagement too well. They can be a little vicious when annoyed.
RORY: Hey. Relax. You do not have to worry about me at all. Five years of Friday night dinners have prepared me for exactly this moment.
LOGAN: Really?
RORY: Remind me to tell you about the time my mom climbed out a second story window to get away from my grandmother.
LOGAN: Ah, I will.
[They climb the steps to the front door.]
LOGAN: Okay, ready?
RORY: Ready.
[Logan rings the bell. Honor rushes out.]
HONOR: You are late!
LOGAN: Fifteen minutes.
HONOR: Well, it's awful! A morgue! It's like they already know what I'm going to tell them.
LOGAN: Well, you have been with Josh for three years now.
HONOR: I don't understand it. I called and told them that you were coming because that usually makes Mom happy. And I told her that you were bringing Rory so they'd be on their company behavior, but from the minute Josh and I walked in that door it's been iceberg city! Josh has completely panicked. Shaking.
LOGAN: Wow. Sorry.
HONOR: Don't be sorry. Just get in here and stop it.
[Honor marches inside. Logan sighs.]
RORY: Hm. Remind me to tell you about the time my mother wore a shirt with a rhinestone penis on it and my grandma had her car towed.
[Logan looks perplexed. They enter the foyer.]
RORY: Look at the ceiling!
LOGAN: Come on.
[He grabs her hand and pulls her through the house.]
RORY: Have you seen this ceiling?
HONOR: Hurry!
SHIRA: Well, look what the cat dragged in.
LOGAN: Sorry we're late, everyone.
SHIRA: It's all right, Logan, we're still waiting for your father. [Logan kisses her.]
LOGAN: Hey Grandpa, nice to see you. [They shake hands.]
ELIAS: Did you get those books I sent you?
LOGAN: I did, thank you. Hey, Josh, it's been a while, you're looking well.
JOSH: You too.
LOGAN: Everyone, I'd like you to meet Rory Gilmore.
RORY: Hi. It's really nice to meet you all. This house is amazing. Seriously, there should be a docent at the door.
SHIRA: Well, thank you, Rory.
LOGAN: You know Rory's grandparents, Mom. Richard and Emily.
SHIRA: Yes, of course. How are Richard and Emily doing?
RORY: They're doing very well.
SHIRA: Oh, that's wonderful.
[There is a moment of awkward silence. The only sound is Elias swishing an ice cube around his glass.]
RORY: So, um, you were at the wedding, right?
SHIRA: Oh. Why, yes. We were. Oh, it was lovely. Emily certainly knows how to plan an event.
RORY: That she does.
SHIRA: I should send her a note.
RORY [nodding]: Hm.
[Rory glances over at Honor, who points to Josh and mouths "Josh". Rory waves. Josh waves back. Elias continues swishing his ice around.]
LOGAN [getting up]: Hey, Grandpa, can I freshen your drink for you?
[Elias grunts. Logan takes his glass.]
SHIRA: Oh, I'm sorry. Can we get you something, Rory?
[Rory begins to shake her head.]
LOGAN: I got it, Mom.
[More awkward silence. Logan hands Rory a glass.]
RORY: Oh, Logan, I don't think I should –
LOGAN: It's club soda, Ace.
RORY: Oh, good.
[The maid brings in a message on a tray. Shira reads it.]
SHIRA: Apparently Mitchum is still at the office. We might as well start dinner. [She stands.] So. [She gestures for everyone to follow her.]
HONOR [to Josh]: Come on. You'll feel better when you've had some food.
JOSH: I'll feel better when we're leaving.
HONOR [to Rory]: So sorry. We owe you one.
RORY: No. [They head for the dining room. Rory points at a painting.] Is that a Velazquez?
LOGAN: Come on.
RORY: It is! That's a Velazquez! This house is so cool!
DRAGONFLY INN – KITCHEN
[Lorelai enters.]
LORELAI: So, I am holding in my hand one of our comment cards on which a particular person has written, and I quote, "best meal I've ever had. The duck was exceptional, the lamb chops were amazing. Ask the chef if he'll marry me." What do you think?
LUKE: I don't know, what does she look like?
LORELAI: I didn't say it was a she.
LUKE: I'll stick with what I have.
LORELAI: Aw, sweet. I didn't know you were making lamb chops.
LUKE: Last minute addition. You know, your cooking crew here is great!
LORELAI: Really?
LUKE: Yeah, Mark the salad guy? Top-notch. Javier is one hell of a grill man, and Manny, your sous-chef? I'd kick Caesar out on his ass if I could steal Manny.
LORELAI: Oh, you covet my kitchen staff. Feeling superior and I like it!
[She leaves. A waiter brings in an order slip.]
LUKE: Okay, guys, we need two sea basses, one chicken, one pepper steak without the pepper, go figure – where's Pedro going?
[Pedro is leaving the kitchen with a ladle. Luke follows him up the stairs and into one of the rooms.]
LUKE: I knew it! Are you insane?
SOOKIE: Well, you wouldn't take my calls!
LUKE: How long have you been up here?
SOOKIE: Since you made me promise that no food would leave the premises. Well, here I am, keeping my promises. Pedro, give me the ladle.
LUKE: Pedro, do not give her that ladle.
SOOKIE: Give me the ladle, Pedro.
LUKE: Vente uno con migo, Pedro!
SOOKIE: Hueso su jefe, Pedro!
LUKE: You're scaring Pedro.
SOOKIE: You're scaring Pedro.
LUKE: All day long things are disappearing. Salads are suddenly gone. Lamb chops don't make it to the table.
SOOKIE: I had to make sure you were doing it right.
LUKE: You're supposed to be home!
SOOKIE: No! I'm supposed to be in bed! And I'm in bed! And you said that you would double-strain the duck sauce and you, my friend, are not double straining!
LUKE: There will be no more of this. No more calls. No more questions. No more ladles that leave that kitchen. I don't care what bed you're in. That is between you and your husband and God, I hope a qualified therapist. But you will not interfere with me anymore. Period.
[He turns to go.]
SOOKIE [to Pedro]: Give me that.
[Luke grabs the ladle and runs.]
HUNTZBERGER MANSION – DINING ROOM
[The family is sitting at the table, being served dinner.]
LOGAN: So, Grandpa, how's the new boat?
ELIAS: It's a boat. It floats.
LOGAN: I hear it's beautiful. When are you going to let me take her out?
SHIRA: Now, Logan, you don't have the best track record when it comes to boats.
LOGAN: Only other people's boats. Our boats are very safe.
HONOR: We should do a summer trip. Maybe hit the Amalfi Coast again? All of us. Rory, Josh, you, me.
[Elias slams his fork down on the table.]
SHIRA: Dad!
ELIAS: Maria!
MARIA: Yes, sir?
ELIAS: It's too hot. Bring me a salad.
SHIRA: I'll be right back. [She gets up.]
[Honor mimes smoking a cigarette to Rory.]
RORY [to Logan]: What?
LOGAN: Mom's a stress smoker.
RORY: Oh. I don't understand why everyone's so upset. Josh seems fine.
LOGAN: The Huntzbergers aren't interested in fine.
ELIAS: Shira!
SHIRA [OS]: Yes, Dad?
ELIAS: What time did Mitchum say he'd be here?
[Shira re-enters the room, coughing a bit and waving the smoke away.]
SHIRA: I don't know. He didn't say.
ELIAS: Well, this is ridiculous!
SHIRA: Please, Dad.
ELIAS: We're all just going to sit around this table and pretend there's nothing going on?
SHIRA: Let's just wait for Mitchum!
ELIAS: There are serious matters to be discussed here. This is an important family. Marrying into it is important business. But no, we can't discuss this until Mitchum gets here! [Maria brings him his salad.] What is this? Go away!
LOGAN: Okay, I'm sorry. I have to jump in here. Grandpa, we all respect you and Mom and Dad, but the bottom line here is, Honor has to be happy. Now, if she loves Josh, then –
HONOR: Logan, I appreciate you defending me but I can take it from here. Mom, Grandpa, I had hoped that you would be happy for me, but obviously that's not going to happen. You didn't even let me announce it to you before you formed your opinion, and I'm sorry you feel the way you do, but Josh and I made it official last week. We are engaged now and no matter what you say, we are going to get married. In June.
SHIRA: Well, of course you're going to get married! You've been dating for three years, and I already put a hold on the Japanese Tea Garden for next spring.
HONOR: Oh. Well, that sounds great, thank you!
LOGAN: So we should celebrate then!
ELIAS: We'll celebrate when we have finished our discussion!
HONOR: Which discussion?
ELIAS: The discussion about unsuitable people marrying into this family.
HONOR: What?
SHIRA [panicked]: I'll be right back! [She rushes out.]
ELIAS: You should know better than this, Logan! I know you like to joke around, and tease us, but I always thought at the end of the day, you understood what your responsibilities to this family were!
LOGAN: Mom, I suggest you come back in here, right now!
SHIRA [hovering near the doorway]: Logan, you just haven't thought about this. I mean, I'm sure Rory understands. She wants to work. Isn't that right, Rory? Emily's always talking about you wanting to be a reporter and travel around doing this and that. A girl like Rory has no idea what it takes to be in this family, Logan.
LOGAN: Oh my God.
SHIRA: She wasn't raised that way. She wasn't bred for it. And this isn't at all about her mother, it's just, you come from two totally different worlds.
ELIAS: It would never work. Not for you, and certainly not for us.
LOGAN: Okay, this conversation is going to end right now. I am not going to sit here –
ELIAS: You are going to be taking over this company! That's what you are going to be doing! And when you do, you are going to need the right kind of person at your side. This isn't college, Logan!
SHIRA: And whatever happened to that Fallon girl? I loved her. Do you talk
anymore?
LOGAN: No, we don't talk! We never talked, you talked.
SHIRA: Oh, what a shame. I just loved her.
LOGAN [gets up]: Okay. Let's go.
SHIRA [calling after them as they leave]: Logan. You have to understand. You bring this girl home without any warning at all, and Honor tells us you're calling her your girlfriend! We have to take that seriously. Logan, come back here!
RORY: I don't understand!
LOGAN: They're psychotic. What more is there to understand?
RORY: But why don't they think I'm good enough?
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: I mean, I'm a Gilmore! Do they know that? My ancestors came over on the Mayflower!
LOGAN: Don't try to analyze it, there's no rhyme or reason!
RORY: I had a coming out party! I went to Chilton, and Yale, and why are they okay with Josh? I mean, he doesn't even say anything! At least I noticed the Velazquez!
LOGAN: Josh isn't marrying the heir to the Huntzberger fortune, you are. [The door opens.] I've got to get out of here.
[Mitchum enters.]
MITCHUM: Logan! Perfect. Did they start dinner? Is it some sort of precious fish dish? ‘Cause I'm dying for a steak. You're Rory, I assume. Heard a lot about you. [They shake hands.]
LOGAN: We're leaving.
MITCHUM: What? Why?
LOGAN: You know why.
MITCHUM: Had a long day, Logan. Don't want to play games. Is dinner over?
LOGAN: No. The Huntzberger family Shanghai is over. Dinner, however is still going on.
MITCHUM: Oh, okay. Okay. What happened? [He walks toward the dining room.] Oh, no. Why is your mother smoking?
LOGAN: We have to go. I'm sure they'll fill you in on everything.
RORY: It was nice to meet you.
[Logan and Rory leave.]
YALE DORMS – PARIS' BEDROOM
[Doyle and Nanny are laughing. Paris opens the door. Doyle rubs salve on his chest.]
DOYLE: Paris, come on in, we're just chatting.
PARIS: I see that.
DOYLE: I got to tell you, Paris, you were right. This stuff is magic. Esa e majica. [Nanny laughs.] She just taught me that.
[Nanny speaks Portuguese and gets up to go.]
DOYLE: Uh-huh.
[She leaves, smiling and nodding at Paris.]
DOYLE: She's great!
PARIS: Yeah, she is. So, you seem better!
DOYLE: I am so much better. Nanny's got me salving every four hours, I've steamed, I've had soup. All I need now is one more good Nyquil knockout sleep, and I'll be as good as new. [He points to the Nyquil.] Hey, could you?
PARIS [grabs it]: Oh, sure.
DOYLE: I've got to tell you, Paris. You're a lifesaver. Really. [Paris stares at the Nyquil in her hand.] Paris? [She looks up.] Paris, the Nyquil!
PARIS: Doyle, it's time we have a talk about our relationship.
DOYLE: But –
PARIS: Doyle, focus!
DRAGONFLY INN – KITCHEN
[Jackson bursts through the door.]
JACKSON: Hey. You in the hat.
LUKE: Jackson, what are you –
JACKSON: How dare you take a ladle from a pregnant woman!
LUKE: What?
JACKSON: Dr. Menck very specifically said that she needs to relax and she cannot relax thinking you're in here screwing up her sauce!
LUKE: I'm not!
JACKSON: Now, while there's a very good chance that you could k*ll me in a fight, I do not care. That woman is my wife, and she is carrying my baby. So from now on, if she wants to talk, you will talk! If she wants to taste your food, you will let her taste your food! If she wants you to double-strain that sauce, you will double-strain that sauce, my friend! Because I have to live with her and if she is upset because of anything that you have done, I will come over here and I will soundly kick your ass! That is if you haven't k*ll me yet! [He marches out of the kitchen.]
LUKE: Hey!
[Luke also marches out of the kitchen.]
DRAGONFLY INN – LIVING ROOM
[Luke walks up to Lorelai.]
LUKE: Hey. That's it. I've had it.
LORELAI: You've had what?
LUKE: She's a crazy woman, and now she's upstairs and ladles are mysteriously flying out of the kitchen.
LORELAI: Who's upstairs?
LUKE: Sookie's upstairs!
LORELAI: No, Sookie's at home.
LUKE: No, Sookie's supposed to be at home. And then I didn't strain the sauce twice, so she came here to drive me crazy and she brought her loony husband with her!
LORELAI: Jackson's here? How am I missing all of this?
LUKE: I don't know, and I don't care! I'm through! I'm not taking this anymore!
LORELAI: What do you mean, you're not taking it anymore? What are you going to do?
LUKE: You want to know what I'm going to do? Nothing! Because I am in a relationship with you and you know very well I can't leave. All I can do is come out here and say I'm through and pretend I have a leg to stand on and then march back into that kitchen and keep doing the job, but, oh, boy. I'm going to be thinking about what I would have done if we weren't in a relationship, even though that would mean I wouldn't be in this position in the first place. [He nods.] Excuse me.
[Lorelai watches him go, then heads upstairs to the room Sookie was in. There are samples of food on the bed, but she is gone. Lorelai goes outside to chase after her.]
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lorelai catches up to Jackson and Sookie, making their getaway in a golf cart. She walks alongside them.]
LORELAI: Ah, if this is the eccentric couple version of the Amazing Race, I think you guys are winning.
JACKSON: Are we talking to her? I don't think we're talking to her.
SOOKIE: Hey, it's Lorelai!
JACKSON: Girlfriend of Luke, and we're not talking to Luke.
SOOKIE: Well, I'm talking to Lorelai. How you doing?
LORELAI: Sookie, this is not bed rest.
SOOKIE: My feet are up.
JACKSON: I told you not to talk to her.
LORELAI: What is with the ‘tude, cranky pants?
SOOKIE: He's very mad at Luke.
LORELAI: Well, I'm not Luke!
JACKSON: By extension, you are Luke.
LORELAI: Sookie, what were you doing at the Inn?
SOOKIE: Checking in on the restaurant. That's my job.
LORELAI: Not anymore. Your job is bed rest.
SOOKIE: Ooh, honey, easy on the bumps. Baby doesn't like the bumps.
LORELAI: Jackson, stop.
JACKSON: She and that boyfriend of hers. Bossiest couple in town.
LORELAI: Stop! At least let me ride!
[Jackson slows down to let Lorelai jump on.]
SOOKIE: Oh!
LORELAI: Okay. Go. [They go.] Sookie, you knew the day was coming when you wouldn't be able to come in!
SOOKIE: I had three weeks.
LORELAI: You never had any applications, did you?
SOOKIE: I meant to. No one was good enough.
LORELAI: Well, no one's as good as you, but plenty of people are good enough! We just need one of them, just till you're back on your feet.
SOOKIE: I know!
LORELAI: You know, Luke's not as good as you either. That kind of cooking's a little fancy for him, but he tried.
SOOKIE: Yeah, he's not bad. He's pretty good, in fact. What does he put in these? [She pulls out a plate covered in foil.]
LORELAI: What is that?
SOOKIE: His lamb chops. They're amazing, I'm taking them home to study.
LORELAI: Well, you could have just asked him.
SOOKIE: Hm, he's mad at me.
JACKSON: We're mad at him!
LORELAI: We're all going to stop being mad at each other. Now, pull over.
JACKSON: Why?
LORELAI: Because, uh, you live here.
JACKSON: Oh, yeah. [He stops the cart.]
LORELAI: You know, Luke said that Manny was doing pretty well.
SOOKIE: I know, I trained him. You know, when I first met him he didn't know a cafette from a chiffonade.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, he's from New Jersey.
SOOKIE: And he picked it up quick.
LORELAI: Maybe he can take over while you're out. Keep it in the family. He knows all your secrets.
SOOKIE: Okay. We'll go with Manny. He's a good guy.
LORELAI: I think that's a good idea.
SOOKIE: Thank Luke for me.
LORELAI: I will.
SOOKIE: And find out what's in these lamb chops, because they're driving me crazy!
LORELAI: I promise. Jackson, get her inside. Don't let her move.
SOOKIE: Hey, how are you going to get back?
LORELAI: Oh, I thought I'd take the cart you guys stole.
SOOKIE: Perfect!
JACKSON: This all turned out pretty good.
[He helps Sookie inside.]
YALE CAMPUS
[Logan is walking Rory home in silence. He looks troubled. They reach the door of her building.]
LOGAN: So. Okay if I just drop you here?
RORY: Drop me here?
LOGAN: Yeah, lights are on. Paris is home. I've had about all the crazy I can for one evening.
RORY: Okay. Sure. You know we don't have to go in, we can go get something to eat.
LOGAN: I'm not hungry.
RORY: Okay.
LOGAN: I just want to walk a little, clear my head.
RORY: Okay.
[They kiss.]
LOGAN: I'll call you later.
RORY: Tomorrow?
LOGAN [walking away]: Uh, yeah. Tomorrow.
[Rory goes inside.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Luke and Lorelai relax on the couch. Luke is nearly asleep. Lorelai flips through channels on the T.V.]
LORELAI: Does it seem like Frodo is on every fricking channel to you, or is it just me?
LUKE: God, I have never been this tired.
LORELAI: Aw. You were one hell of a white knight today, baby.
LUKE: Yes, I'm a regular Lancelot.
LORELAI: You're starting to snooze.
LUKE: Uh-huh.
LORELAI [softly]: Do you want to go upstairs, or are you okay right here?
LUKE: Uh-huh.
LORELAI [whispers]: Luke.
[Luke groans.]
LORELAI [whispers]: What did you put in the lamb chops?
LUKE: Forget it.
LORELAI: Come on!
[The phone rings.]
LUKE: Saved by the bell.
LORELAI: I'll be right back. [She answers the phone.] Hello?



[Scene cuts from Lorelai's house to Rory's bedroom.]
RORY: You busy?
LORELAI: What's wrong?
RORY: Dinner was awful.
LORELAI [whispers]: Hold on. [She gets up and goes into the kitchen, careful not to disturb Luke.] Okay, hit it.
RORY: Well, to make a long story short, Logan's family hates me.
LORELAI: That's impossible. It's like hating Thumper. No one hates Thumper.
RORY: They think I'm trash. They think I'm not good enough to marry into their family.
LORELAI: What are they talking about? Don't they know you're a Gilmore?
RORY: I don't think they care.
LORELAI: Ah, pfft. And who said anything about marrying into their family?
RORY: Apparently, Logan bringing me over for dinner said that I was going to marry into their family.
LORELAI: Uh, that's crazy.
RORY: I know! But then they got all panicked and they started saying all these things –
LORELAI: To your face?
RORY: Right there at the dinner table!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: They went on and on about how I'm going to be a career woman and Logan, you don't want that, she won't understand our lifestyle or the demands, or, or the family responsibilities!
LORELAI: What family responsibilities? Who are they, the Gambino's?
RORY: Then his mother starts in on that lovely Fallon girl, and doesn't Logan see her anymore? Because she would make a perfect choice!
LORELAI: And what did you say?
RORY: Nothing. I just sat there. I just sat there and let them say that I wasn't good enough, and that Logan was making a mistake, and just wait till his father came home!
LORELAI: I hate these people!
RORY: It was awful.
LORELAI: Well, Logan didn't just sit there and let them attack you all night, did he?
RORY: No. He got really mad and he told them they were all crazy and then we left.
LORELAI: Well, good for him.
RORY: But we didn't say a word to each other all the way home. And then walking back to my dorm, he just looked so freaked. I could tell that he was just, I don't know, rethinking everything. The whole relationship. I'm just afraid he's going to bolt. Mom?
[Lorelai has been shaking her head in disapproval, not saying anything.]
LORELAI: Can I say something? Something you may not want to hear?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: If he is going to bolt, maybe you should let him bolt. He told you, Rory, he told you he was not a commitment kind of guy, just like you're not a non-commitment kind of girl. And you tried to be something you weren't and it was bad. It didn't work for you. Don't try and force him to be something he's not.
RORY: I didn't force him!
LORELAI: I know, but he was looking at losing you, and he didn't want to and I give him credit for that, but maybe in the end this is not the guy or the relationship for you.
RORY: I don't care what his family thinks.
LORELAI: This has nothing to do with his family.
RORY: We're good together, Mom. I'm good for him.
LORELAI: But maybe he isn't good for you.
RORY: People can change!
LORELAI: Do you really want to be in the business of changing someone?
RORY: Maybe he wants to change!
LORELAI: Rory, two days ago you were on the bathroom floor crying about why he won't call you. Why doesn't he like you, what did you do?
RORY: I was drunk. I was sick!
LORELAI: You, my beautiful, brainy, fabulous daughter, were lying on the floor of the bathroom, wondering what you had done wrong! Which is disturbing to me on several levels, including the fact that I can't remember the last time I cleaned the floor of the bathroom! Is that really the kind of relationship you want to be in?
[Rory is frowning. There is a knock on the door of her common room.]
RORY: Hold on.
[She goes to answer the door, still holding the phone. Logan is standing in the door.]
RORY: Hey. Everything okay?
LOGAN: I'm sorry.
RORY: For what?
LOGAN: For just taking off like that. I just, this was a very intense evening for me.
RORY: I'm sure.
LOGAN: But taking off like that, I was overreacting, that's just stupid. So, forgive me?
RORY: There's nothing to forgive.
LOGAN: Come on, grab your coat. I'll take you to get something to eat.
RORY: Okay. I'll be right back.
[She goes back into her bedroom and closes the door.]
RORY [on the phone]: Did you hear that?
LORELAI: Yeah. I sure did.
RORY: Everything's fine. I just got upset about nothing.
LORELAI: Okay, but –
RORY: Thanks for the talk, Mom, and I heard you, but I have to go.
LORELAI: Okay. Call me tomorrow.
RORY: I will.
[She hangs up, gets her coat, and leaves. Lorelai hangs up and stares at the floor, helpless.]
YALE NEWSROOM
[Paris is talking to Rory at her desk.]
PARIS: He got dumped two years ago. Apparently, it was a vicious Julia Roberts to Kiefer Sutherland kind of dump. She broke his heart, slept with his best friend, and took the dog. He swore off women completely until he met me.
RORY: Wow. That was a lot of ground you guys covered last night.
PARIS: He finally admitted, once his cough started coming back, that what we have he no longer views as casual. He said we are officially in a committed
–
RORY: Hey, I know that word!
PARIS: - Relationship, and I would not be remotely out of line if I called myself his girlfriend. And then I handed him the Nyquil, and then he passed out.
RORY: Very romantic.
PARIS: I know.
[Mitchum enters the newsroom.]
RORY: I'm happy for you.
PARIS: I'm happy for me too. Mr. Huntzberger! [She stands suddenly.]
MITCHUM: Hello, there. Hello, Rory.
RORY: Hi.
PARIS: Paris Gellar. We met a couple of months ago. [She shakes his hand.]
MITCHUM: I remember the handshake. Reminded me of Jimmy Breslin's.
PARIS: High compliment.
MITCHUM: Would you excuse us?
PARIS: Oh, sure. [She leaves.]
RORY: Are you looking for Logan?
MITCHUM: No, I know better than to look for my son in the newsroom. I came to talk to you.
RORY: About what?
MITCHUM: I'm very sorry about what happened the other night.
RORY: It's okay.
MITCHUM: My family behaved atrociously, and, though Logan was a little naïve to walk into the lion's den without a chair like that, they were wrong and you deserve an apology.
RORY: Okay. Thank you.
MITCHUM: So, I hear you have some rather lofty journalistic aspirations.
RORY [nods]: I have plans.
MITCHUM: You know, my company just acquired a small newspaper. The Stamford Eagle Gazette. Decent circulation, pretty sorry writing, but definite potential. When we buy a new paper, I like to spend some time there. Take a couple of months, help turn it around, make sure we're getting our money's worth. Stamford isn't a bad train ride from here, is it?
RORY: Um, no.
MITCHUM: I have an internship available, if you're interested.
RORY: An internship?
MITCHUM: Be a good chance for you to get your feet wet. Experience how the real thing works.
RORY: No. Thank you.
MITCHUM [confused]: No, thank you?
RORY: I appreciate the offer. But no.
MITCHUM [stands up as if to leave, then turns back to Rory]: May I be so bold as to inquire, why the hell not?
RORY: Because I have a feeling that the only reason you're doing this is because you feel guilty about what happened the other night at dinner, and it's very nice, but very unnecessary.
MITCHUM: So what?
RORY: Excuse me?
MITCHUM: Say the only reason I offered this to you is because my family behaved badly and I wanted to make up for it. Say I have no interest in furthering your career. This is still an opportunity. Who cares why you got the opportunity? It's here, and life is about making the most of everything you're handed. Well, this is being handed to you. Now, what are you going to do about it?
[Rory looks thoughtful. Mitchum smiles in victory.]
MITCHUM: Monday. Ten o'clock. Call my office for the details. [He begins walking away.] And bring a pencil! You never know when you're going to need a pencil!
[He leaves.]

LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai sits quietly at the kitchen table, feet up, cordless phone to her ear. Her eyes move back and forth over the floor. Switch to Rory's dorm. She is doing the same thing. Camera pans out back at Lorelai's to show that she is watching an a*t*matic vacuum roll around. So is Rory.]
LORELAI: So is this more or less fun than watching the same T.V. show at the same time?
RORY: I think it's more.
LORELAI: You know, if we died right now, and decomposed, it would vacuum us up and no one would ever know.
RORY: Freaky.
OPENING CREDITS
YALE DORMS - RORY'S COMMON ROOM
[Paris enters from outside, wearing a pink bathrobe and toweling her hair.]
PARIS [singing]: I'm walking on sunshine! Whoa! I'm walking on sunshine, whoa! I'm walking on sunshine, whoa! And don't it feel good! Hey, all right!
[Rory emerges from her bedroom.]
RORY: Hey!
PARIS: What?
RORY: Learn a new song, or I am tying you to a chair and putting Hotel Rwanda on again.
PARIS: It's love, baby. Deal. [She brushes her hair.]
RORY: You're not going to use that as a microphone, are you?
PARIS: Oh, no, Reverend has the town band dancing and singing? [Paris grins.] I'm really happy.
RORY: Doyle, I assume?
PARIS: You know, he calls me his girlfriend now with no visible shaking.
RORY: I'm happy you're happy.
PARIS: So, how are things with Logan?
RORY [smiling]: You want to hand me that hairbrush?
PARIS: Look at us. We're happy, we have boyfriends! This is infinitely better than any mood stabilizer I have ever been on.
[Someone knocks on the door.]
RORY: Oh, sh**t, what time is it?
PARIS: It's Hammer time.
RORY: It's Logan. Hairbrushes down.
PARIS: You got it.
[Rory walks over and opens the door.]
LOGAN: Evening, Ace.
RORY: Hi.
[They kiss.]
PARIS: Nice. Very nice.
RORY: Hey, you want to see my room? It's far away from here.
LOGAN: Super idea.
[They go into her room and close the door. They kiss some more.]
RORY: Hello.
LOGAN: Hello.
RORY: What are you thinking about?
LOGAN: Whether or not you've ever woken up with Paris standing over you with a knife.
RORY: Not recently. She's been in a good mood.
LOGAN: Why is that?
RORY: Because she's in love.
LOGAN: With Doyle?
RORY: Yes, with Doyle. And do not mock or make fun, because when Paris is happy, the whole world is happy. But when she's not happy, the whole world is Deadwood.
LOGAN: Got it. You hungry?
RORY: Yes, I'm starving. Just let me get my sweater. [She opens her closet.] Hey, what do you think of this dress? Does it look newspaper-y enough?
LOGAN: What?
RORY: I'm trying to figure out what to wear on my first day at the paper.
LOGAN: Ah, the internship rears its ugly head again.
RORY: I want to look professional but not too Lois Lane-y, and I don't want to look like a college kid.
LOGAN: You are a college kid.
RORY: Not on Monday. On Monday, I am a newspaper woman. And I have to look like a newspaper woman.
LOGAN: Whatever you wear will be fine.
RORY: I'm so excited. [She hangs up the dress.]
LOGAN: I can tell.
RORY: Oh. Last night, I couldn't sleep, so I Googled your father.
LOGAN: Excuse me?
RORY: Twelve thousand fifty three items came up. I could only pull up a couple thousand, but it really helped. [She holds up the stack of papers, flipping through them. Logan looks amused and a little disturbed.] He was born in 1953, Episcopalian, second of four children, oldest boy, Yale undergrad, star of the track team. No grad school. Interesting. Then he had a couple of lost years. Kind of a blank period, a little Jesus thing going on there. Worked as a reporter and editor for two of the Huntzberger papers before taking over as CEO of the company!
LOGAN: Uh –
RORY: I mean, when you look at all these accomplishments, the man must never sleep!
LOGAN: Well –
RORY: Ah. Mm-hm, four hours a night. Just like Clinton.
LOGAN: You don't have a wall in a secret room with pictures of my father pasted all over it, do you?
RORY: Logan, I'm going to be interning for him. I need to know everything about him. Is he an egghead? Because he seems very roll-up-the-sleeves-y. But he's written about everything, from foreign affairs, domestic policies. He had a wine column, for God's sake. I should learn more about wine.
LOGAN: Look, Rory –
RORY: What are his politics? He's unbelievably neutral in his writing! Right wing, left wing, middle wing. Oh, the man was short-listed for the Pulitzer for covering the Iranian hostage crisis when he was twenty-five!
LOGAN: Yeah, I heard something about that.
RORY: Twenty-five! How did he do that? Especially considering his lost years? He's a born journalist. I mean, what does he read? What papers, what journals? Come on, tell me something.
LOGAN: He hates peas.
RORY: Logan, I need your help here.
LOGAN: Rory, my dad and I basically have two conversations. ‘Logan, you're not living up to your potential' and ‘Logan, when you're sailing close-hauled, wait until you gain that last bit of boat speed before you pull in the jib sheet.' That's it.
RORY: But –
LOGAN: Ace! You've learned more about my father in one night than I've learned in my whole life! Don't worry. You're going to be fine! Now, I thought we've established that we're both starving.
RORY: Yes, we have. Let's go.
[She puts down her notes on Mitchum, grabs her sweater and turns to leave. She remembers something else, and turns around to write it down.]
RORY: Oh! Wait! Your dad covered Haiti in 1985. Must learn more about Haiti. Got it. Okay, let's go. Hey, have you ever discussed Pinochet with him? Because one time he wrote –
LOGAN: Peas, Ace. Peas.
RORY: Right. Sorry.
[He directs her out the door.]
YALE CLASSROOM
[Rory and classmates sit around a large round table. The professor lectures.]
PROFESSOR: As we move on from the empiricist to the rationalist, it would be good to start thinking about the differences between the A posteriori truths, and the Apriority truths of the rationalist, which exists independent of experience. So for Wednesday if you would all take a crack at the first five chapters of Spinoza's Ethics. That is, those of you who's entire weekend won't be consumed by books on wine and Haiti.
[He gestures at the stack of reference books piled in front of Rory.]
RORY: Yes. My interests are teasingly diverse.
PROFESSOR: Whatever. See you all on Wednesday.
[The students pack up their things. Rory's cell phone rings.]
RORY: Hello?
[Scene cuts from the classroom to Stars Hollow Street, where Lorelai is walking.]
LORELAI: Ah, thank God. Did you return the blue sweater?
RORY: Oh, no.
LORELAI: Answer, please.
RORY: Two days ago.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Why? Because two days ago you asked me to take it back. Demanded me, in fact.
LORELAI: And suddenly you're just so freakin' reliable, you just hop to it and do whatever I say?
RORY: I've always been freakin' reliable. It's how I was raised.
LORELAI: Oh, so blame me.
RORY: I am not returning the blue sweater again, so don't think about asking.
LORELAI: But I want it, I need it.
RORY: I've already returned the Capri pants twice. I've tried to return a couple of your other items that were all sales final, which makes me look retail simple. And this is not the first, but the second time I will have returned the blue sweater.
LORELAI: Ooh, the Capri pants. Have you taken those back yet?
RORY: I can't show my face in any stores in New Haven. They think I'm Paper Mooning them.
LORELAI [proud]: Oh, she was very cute in Paper Moon. You're very cute, too.
RORY: Calling me cute is not going to persuade me. And I have classes. A life.
LORELAI: Monday afternoon. That's your free time, right? I remember some bragging to that effect. Go back on Monday.
RORY: Oh. Well, Monday used to be free.
LORELAI: Used to be? It's not free anymore?
RORY: I guess we haven't talked in a couple of days. Um, I actually got an internship.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Kind of an important high-profile one.
LORELAI: Wow! That's great!
RORY: It's for a newspaper in Stamford that Logan's dad acquired. He offered me the spot himself.
LORELAI: Logan's dad.
RORY: Yeah. It was kind of out of the blue.
LORELAI: So when did you hear?
RORY: Just a few days ago. I forgot I hadn't told you, I start on Monday.
LORELAI: Wow, congratulations!
RORY: It's a pretty amazing opportunity.
LORELAI: Yeah, sounds like it. You'll be having lunch with the off-bet editors from the Times. Hanging out with Peter Jennings. Dan Rather will be valet parking your car.
RORY: Yeah, it's more likely that I'll be pulling wire reports off the AP machine, but sure.
LORELAI: Good, good. So, no worries on the blue sweater front.
RORY: It's off my radar screen.
LORELAI: Really? So you're really not going to make the effort?
RORY: I'll see if I can swing by on Tuesday.
LORELAI: Just send your assistant. You're getting an assistant, right?
RORY: Oh, I'm sure. I'll see you Friday night.
LORELAI: Bye, hon.
RORY: Bye.
STARS HOLLOW – TWICKHAM HOUSE
[Luke walks into the diorama room.]
LUKE: Taylor?
TAYLOR [OS]: Hello, is someone out there?
LUKE: Where are you, Taylor?
TAYLOR [OS]: Over here! I can't move!
[Luke wanders through the room, notices the horse mannequin with the Jebediah family on top of it. Taylor's hand waves from underneath the pile.]
LUKE: Oh, I have got to get a camera.
[He walks over to look at Taylor.]
LUKE: How in the hell did you do this?
TAYLOR: I was doing a little light dusting, and was toying with the idea of repositioning the horse's hindquarters, and the whole thing came tumbling down.
LUKE: You can't leave anything alone, can you?
TAYLOR: Are you going to help me, or not? I feel like I've been lying here for days.
LUKE: You have not been lying here for days. Kirk came into the diner two hours ago.
TAYLOR: You waited two hours to come and get me?
LUKE: I have a business. I can't come running every time a family of mannequins decides to attack you.
[He starts to lift the horse off of Taylor.]
TAYLOR: Ow!
LUKE: Just lie still.
TAYLOR: Oh, this is so humiliating.
LUKE: Taylor, don't you think it's time?
TAYLOR: Time for what?
LUKE: You've been trapped under the Jebediahs for two hours and no one has come in here.
TAYLOR: What's your point, Luke?
LUKE: My point is the museum's a bust.
TAYLOR: Well, I'll admit. Attendance is low.
LUKE: No one is coming!
TAYLOR: I was reading an article about the power of bus bench ads for getting the word out. Very big in the music industry. Apparently the rapper, Fitty Cent, swears by them.
LUKE: Taylor, come on. Isn't it time to sell? Let somebody who really wants this place have it!
TAYLOR: I guess it is. I had such dreams.
LUKE: There'll be other dreams.
TAYLOR: I guess. You can resume your attempts to get me out of here.
LUKE: You're definitely ready to sell the house?
TAYLOR: Yes.
LUKE: Then let's get you out of here.
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE
[Emily, Richard and Rory are eating dinner.]
RORY: Tennis lessons? That sounds great, Grandma.
EMILY: I've always liked tennis. And I have to say, I'm excited by the prospect of getting some good, healthy exercise.
RICHARD: I'm excited by the prospect of those fetching tennis costumes.
EMILY: Richard, not in front of Rory.
RORY: Oh, I'm fairly worldly now, Grandma.
RICHARD: She was a heck of a tennis player in her day. And very competitive.
EMILY: I wasn't that competitive.
RICHARD: This woman was kicked off the field hockey team in Smith for elbowing Ceci Everetts in the neck.
EMILY: She got in my way.
RICHARD: And this happened in the parking lot after the game.
EMILY: Now, now. Rory, tell us a little more about this internship. It sounds very exciting.
RORY: Well, all I really know is that I'm going to be shadowing Mitchum Huntzberger, just to sort of learn and observe, plus pitching in here and there.
RICHARD: You are going to learn a hell of a lot.
EMILY: It was very sweet of Logan to arrange this for you.
RORY: Well, actually, Mitchum Huntzberger offered it to me himself.
EMILY [impressed]: Really?
RICHARD: Now, how about that? He just called you up? Your reputation for excellence preceded you?
RORY: Well, he came by Yale, actually. I had met him when I had dinner at his house, and then –
EMILY: Dinner? What dinner?
RORY: Um, just a dinner that Logan took me to.
RICHARD: At the Huntzbergers' house?
RORY: Well, yes.
EMILY: When? When?
RORY: About a week ago, I guess.
RICHARD: Good Lord.
EMILY: Richard, it's already been a week!
RICHARD: We need to invite him right away!
RORY: Who?
EMILY: Logan! The ball's been dropped!
RICHARD: I'll put an invite in the mail first thing tomorrow.
EMILY: We really should have had him over first. We probably should call him as well.
RICHARD: We could messenger it in by tonight, it isn't even eight.
RORY: Well, it's really nice of you to want to have him over, really, but you don't need to.
EMILY: Rory, if you could mention it to him yourself, preferably tonight, I'll get a note over to him tomorrow.
RICHARD: He'll need a choice of dates.
EMILY: I'll get my book.
RICHARD: I'll get mine, too.
[They get up and rush off.]
EMILY: Rory!
RORY: Mm! Oh, call him now!
RICHARD: Right now, right now, right now.
RORY: Oh, okay!
[She gets up and goes to the phone. Scene cuts between the Gilmore's living room and Logan's dorm, where he is reading on the couch.]
LOGAN: Hello?
RORY: Listen. You're going to be getting a note from the Gilmores sometime soon. Maybe in the mail, maybe hand delivered tonight. For all I know, a carrier pigeon is heading for your room as we speak. You might want to open your window.
LOGAN: Why is a carrier pigeon heading here?
RORY: They want to have you over for dinner.
LOGAN: Oh.
RORY: They're flipping out about it. She's sending an apology for being so remiss as to wait one whole week since I had dinner at your house to extend an invitation. I mean, they're losing it. So I'm calling to warn you, and, I want you to know, I didn't suggest us having dinner with them or encourage it in any way. And I definitely did not refer to you as my b-word in front of them or even imply it in any way. Because, you know, I'm really happy with the way things have been going and I don't want any pressure put on us, and I'm sorry, and I think I already said that, and that's it.
LOGAN: What are the odds of getting out of this?
RORY: Pretty much zero.
LOGAN: Then let's do it.
RORY: Really?
LOGAN: Yeah, it won't be so bad.
RORY: Well, you are a true gentleman. [She hears a bang from Logan's end of the phone.] Oh, my God, what was that?
LOGAN: Carrier pigeon. Should have opened the window.
RORY: Not funny.
LOGAN: Kinda funny.
RORY [smiling]: Bye.
LOGAN: Bye.
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke serves Lorelai dinner.]
LUKE : Burger rare, cheddar cheese, barbecue sauce on the side.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, save Rory some lemon pie.
LUKE: Rory's coming in tonight?
LORELAI: Yeah, she's going to see Lane's band play at Positively Four Street tonight. They have the coveted three in the morning slot.
LUKE: I hear that's how Zeppelin started.
LORELAI: Yeah, her genius plan is to come home, go to bed early, set the clock for two, get up and go rock.
LUKE: Solid plan.
LORELAI: Yes, except that when the clock goes off at two, she will be dead asleep and won't hear it. I, however, will. I will then proceed to get up, drag myself downstairs, recreating a classic Zucker Brothers moment and then I'll shake her awake. She'll get up, throw on some jeans, a t-shirt, and no make-up and look like a Neutrogena ad, whereas once she leaves, I'll pass out on the couch, too exhausted to make it all the way upstairs, and in the morning I will have bags under my eyes that should have Tumi stamped on them. I love being a mom. [They see some men carrying a mannequin down the street.] Aw. Are the guys in town unusually lonely these days?
LUKE: No, they're from the museum. I think they're getting ready to close it.
LORELAI: Close it? No! Why?
LUKE: Oh, well, you know, no one was going.
LORELAI: I was going.
LUKE: Oh, well, you went once.
LORELAI: No, I was going to go again! Just as soon as the nightmares about the ‘I love Jesus' mannequin subsided.
LUKE: Well, you saw it once.
LORELAI [sighs]: I guess.
[Rory enters.]
RORY: Here's your sweater, and I hope you're happy, because the saleswoman called me a name. Where's my pie?
LORELAI: Luke! Pie!
[She pulls the sweater out of the bag and wrinkles her nose.]
LORELAI: What do we think?
RORY: It's great.
LORELAI: Huh.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: I thought it was light blue.
RORY: No, it was dark blue.
LORELAI: Oh. Did they have one that was light blue?
RORY: You are officially banned from ever shopping in New Haven again.
LORELAI: Well, thank God I have you to do it for me.
[Luke brings over Rory's pie.]
RORY: Hey, Luke. You're the only one I like around here at the moment.
LUKE: Right back at you.
LORELAI: Okay, so, other than your stylist duties, what else is going on in the life of the young and hopeful?
RORY: I'm considering taking Russian.
LORELAI: Oh, very practical. How's Logan?
RORY: He's fine. Grandma and Grandpa invited him to dinner.
LORELAI: You're kidding.
RORY: It was actually less of an invite and more of a freak-out. They heard about the dinner I went to.
LORELAI: Heard how much?
RORY: The Reader's Digest version.
LORELAI: Got it.
RORY: Apparently they've already exceeded the polite reciprocal invite window, and if he doesn't come to dinner soon, Grandma has to give back her pearls.
LORELAI: Wow. So, um, when is this dinner happening?
RORY: Three dates were proposed. Logan's picking one of them.
LORELAI: Huh. So it should be an interesting evening.
RORY: Yep. I'll take notes and pictures.
LORELAI: Cool, okay. You do that.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S BEDROOM
[The digital clock says it is 12:30. Lorelai suddenly pounces on sleeping Rory. Rory whines.]
LORELAI: I want to go to dinner.
RORY: Where's the clock?
LORELAI: I mean, you said that I could meet Logan properly, and you know how good I am when there's food involved!
RORY: Twelve thirty!
LORELAI: I mean, is there a reason I wasn't invited?
RORY: Ah. Can't we talk about this tomorrow?
LORELAI: It is tomorrow. I just don't think it's right that they get first dibs on him. I mean, I am your mom, and we are very close, in case you haven't heard, and I should get to know him first!
RORY: Grandma and Grandpa already know him!
LORELAI: Huh! Okay, so they have a head start! Fine. But I bet they won't know him, know him like I will know him if you let me go to dinner.
RORY: I didn't think you'd want to come to dinner.
LORELAI: Why not?
RORY: Well, it's at their house, first of all, and I don't know how you feel about the Logan situation.
LORELAI: Hey, this guy is in your life and I want to know him. Don't you want me to know him?
RORY: Of course I want you to know him.
LORELAI: Okay, so –
RORY: I'd love for you to come to dinner.
LORELAI: Great! Good. You call Grandma for me. [She gets up and heads out the door.]
RORY: No way!
LORELAI [startled, turns around]: Why not?
RORY: You want to come to dinner, you call Grandma!
LORELAI: But I'm not talking to Grandma.
RORY: Well, you're going to have to talk to her if you come to dinner!
LORELAI: No, I won't.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: No. I am there to talk to Logan. To get to know him. I mean, other than the fact that he's blond, rich and straight, I'm out.
RORY: You're not going to come to dinner and ignore Grandma.
LORELAI: I will not be ignoring her. I just don't think I'll get to her.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Well, I've heard through the grapevine that Logan is so chatty that once you get him started there's no shutting him up.
RORY: Mom, forget it. If you want to go, then you are going to have to call Grandma and tell her that you're going!
LORELAI: But –
RORY: Now, I have to get up in two hours! So, if you don't mind, b*at it!
LORELAI: But –
RORY: Hey! Sleeping!
[Rory shoos Lorelai out of her room. Lorelai turns on the light as she leaves.]
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI [flips it back off]: Sorry!
STAMFORD EAGLE GAZETTE
[Rory gets off the elevator. She looks lost.]
RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you?
RORY: I was just trying to figure out if I'm in the right place.
RECEPTIONIST: Were you hoping to be in some sort of newspaper office?
RORY: Yes, I was. I'm Rory Gilmore, I'm an intern. Mitchum, uh, Mr. Huntzberger, hired me. For nothing, of course, because an intern makes nothing and they're happy to do it. I'm new.
RECEPTIONIST: Here's a temporary I.D. Sometime today, stop by and see Al Carson. He'll take a picture and give you a permanent one.
RORY: I've never had a picture I.D. before! I'll take very good care of it. Is there a fine if you lose it?
RECEPTIONIST: No fine.
RORY: Well, I still won't lose it. I promise.
RECEPTIONIST: Okay, you need to go see Harry, he deals with interns. [She presses a button on her switchboard.] Good morning, Eagle Gazette. Please hold. [She presses a button again.] Good morning, Eagle Gazette.
RORY: Uh, where do I find Harry?
RECEPTIONIST [waves her hand toward some cubicles]: I'm sorry, Mr. Wallace won't be in until this afternoon. Uh-huh.
[Rory wanders toward the cubicles, still looking very lost.]
RORY: Harry? [She waits and then, a little louder] Harry!
[A man stands up.]
HARRY: Who called Harry?
RORY [waving]: I did! I called Harry! Hi! I'm Rory Gilmore. Um, I'm an intern, I have I.D., and –
HARRY: Okay. This is basically the newsroom. Reporters, support staff over there, the composing room where we do paste-up. It's called paste-up because it used to be done with –
RORY: Scissors and paste!
HARRY: Right, but now we do it on a Mac. In that cabinet are all our back-issues. '95 to present are on CD-ROM, earlier on microfiche. If you use the microreader, make sure you turn it off, because the bulb is too hot and melts the stuff.
RORY [digging in her pockets]: Boy, I sure wish I had a pencil.
HARRY: This is Tom Firth's desk. He writes Firth Things First on the op-ed. That's Ed Rose, circulation, advertising. In case of fire, stairs are that way. This is the kitchen. Coffee, stale donuts. If you finish a pot, you make a new one.
MAN [calls from OS]: Harry!
HARRY: Be right back.
[Rory is impressed by the coffee room. She pours herself a cup, takes out her camera phone and poses by the water cooler to take a photo of herself. She hears a commotion outside the door.]
WOMAN: Is he here yet?
MAN: Huntzberger's here.
[The staff huddle around nervously.]
HARRY: Huntzberger's here.
RORY: Where?
HARRY: He's one of those guys there.
RORY: Yeah, in the middle. Striped tie.
HARRY: You know Huntzberger?
RORY: Yes.
HARRY: Really? What's he like?
RORY: Um, Episcopalian. Second of four children, oldest boy. And um, hates peas.
[A man, assumed to be the previous manager of the newspaper, is giving Mitchum a tour.]
MANAGER: This is Stan Mercer, circulation. Les Cavanaugh, city b*at. Stephanie Fitz-Simmons, photo editor. And this is Patel [pause] Kandrasaskar. He's our resident computer whiz.
MITCHUM: Okay. Lot of people, lot of names, and I promise I'll learn some of them. [The staff laughs politely.] We'll talk more about this at the general meeting, but I want you people to understand that the Huntzberger Publishing Group isn't going to change what you do. We're going to help you do what you do better. All right, I want to get all the department heads gathered in the conference room in ten minutes. Someone make some coffee. Rory?
RORY: Yes sir?
MITCHUM: You ready to shadow me?
RORY: Yes, sir!
MITCHUM: Let's go.
[They start walking down the hall. Rory stops to set down her coffee, turns around and they are gone. She turns to Harry.]
RORY: Did you see where they went?
[Harry shrugs. Rory looks upset and takes off down one of the halls.]
DRAGONFLY INN – FRONT DESK
[Lorelai is glaring at the phone. She finally picks it up and dials a number. After one ring, Emily picks up.]
EMILY: Hello?
[Lorelai opens her mouth, but no sound comes out.]
EMILY: Hello? Who are you looking for? Did you dial the wrong number? You know, it's very rude to dial someone and then just sit there on the phone without so much as a grunt or a moan.
[Lorelai opens her mouth to speak again.]
EMILY: I mean, as far as perverted phone calls go, this is a very poor one.
LORELAI [sighs]: Mom, hello.
EMILY: Lorelai? Is Rory okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, Rory's fine.
EMILY: Did somebody die? Who died?
LORELAI: Nobody died, Mom. Everyone we know is fine.
EMILY: Then why are you calling?
LORELAI: Well, I was wondering –
EMILY: Yes.
LORELAI: I just wanted to give you a heads up that I was thinking I might come to Friday night dinner. [Pause.] Mom, hello?
EMILY: When?
LORELAI: Um, Friday night?
EMILY: This Friday night?
LORELAI: Yes.
EMILY: The night that Logan Huntzberger is coming to dinner.
LORELAI: I guess. Sure.
EMILY: Well, that's quite a coincidence, isn't it? That Logan's coming to dinner the night that you're suddenly free.
LORELAI: Well, I guess so.
EMILY: Do you really think that it's going to work this way?
LORELAI: What way?
EMILY: That you just check the itinerary and pick which Friday night dinners you'll deign to come to, and which ones you won't?
LORELAI: I am not picking. It just happened that this Friday I –
EMILY: Did you wait ‘till we have a guest like the Pope for dinner and then say, oh, yes, well, now it's worth my while to have dinner with my family, I get to meet the Pope.
LORELAI: You're Protestant, Mom.
EMILY: You do not get to cherry-pick which Friday night dinners you attend. It does not work that way. It's never worked that way.
LORELAI: I wasn't cherry-picking.
EMILY: If you come to this dinner, you come to them all. That's the deal.
LORELAI: Well, I'm really not sure that I'm free every Friday night from now through eternity.
EMILY: If you come to this dinner then you come to them all. That's the deal.
LORELAI: As I said before, I'm just not sure about my schedule –
EMILY: Well, I'll tell you what. You go check that schedule of yours. If you show up on Friday night, the night that Logan Huntzberger happens to be here, then I'll assume that you've discovered that your Fridays, at least for the foreseeable future, are free. Good-bye.
[She hangs up the phone.]
STAMFORD EAGLE GAZETTE
[Mitchum and his colleagues are walking through the building, talking business. Rory is struggling to keep up.]
MITCHUM: I'm saying it's these little costs that's having you drop your hard correspondents. How much are you paying for syndicated features? You run Dear Abby, and Ann Landers, and Ask Vicky. How many different ways do the people in this community need to hear ‘honey, he ain't going to change, dump his ass.'?
[Rory, several paces behind the group, takes off her heeled shoes and jogs a little bit to catch up.]
MANAGER: I'd like to get that physical plant tour in before five.
MITCHUM: Well, if we're in a holding pattern, why don't you start getting into those circulation issues?
[The other men leave Mitchum alone with Rory. He is reading a file.]
RORY: Wow. The ability to run a four minute mile would come in pretty handy right about now, huh?
MITCHUM: Sorry?
RORY: A four minute mile?
MITCHUM [looks up, confused]: I don't follow.
RORY: At Yale. Uh, track and field. You ran a four minute mile.
MITCHUM: Oh. Right.
RORY: That's fast. Four minute mile, whoosh!
MANAGER [emerging from the conference room]: Dan's going to need another ten. Why don't I take you into Ron Stone's, we'll talk some advertising.
MITCHUM: Let's do it.
[They walk into a nearby office. Rory sighs and starts to follow. The door is shut in her face. She is unsure of whether to open the door or not. Harry walks by.]
HARRY: If you're looking for Huntzberger, he went in there.
[He points at the door.]
RORY [sarcastic]: Oh, thanks.
[She hesitates on opening the door again, but decides not to. She walks into a nearby cubicle and picks up the phone. Scene cuts to Logan, working on his laptop.]
LOGAN: Hello?
RORY: Help, help, help!
LOGAN: What's the matter, Ace?
RORY: Nothing! I've just won the Spaz of the Year award. I believe it'll be on the front page of the Gazette tomorrow.
LOGAN: Oh, I'm sure it's not that bad.
RORY: I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't know where anybody is. I can't walk in these shoes. I got a run in my pantyhose. I ran into a file cabinet.
LOGAN: Slow down!
RORY: I didn't even know if I was supposed to go to lunch when everybody went to lunch, so I just stood in the break room for, like, forty-five minutes! And then I ate an Altoid.
LOGAN: It's the first day. It'll get better.
RORY: Your father must think I'm an idiot.
LOGAN: I'm sure he doesn't.
RORY: I need some help. I need something to say to him other than, ‘yes, the bleeding stopped, thanks'.
LOGAN: Hey, I think that's pretty good.
RORY: Logan, please. Give me something. Something I can use to connect with him.
LOGAN: I don't know!
RORY: You do know. This is important to me, Logan. Please?
LOGAN [sighs]: He likes jazz, but not when it gets too experimental, and he hates when they quote My Favorite Things.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: My Favorite Things, from the Sound of Music.
RORY [writing on a notepad]: Okay. Good. Go on.
LOGAN: Uh, he lets people go at seven, but he keeps going ‘till eight thirty or nine, and he notices the people who stay. He hates double talk, but he's really good at it. And, uh, he has high blood pressure so he switches to decaf after four.
RORY: That's good. That's almost something.
LOGAN: Don't worry, Ace, I'm sure you're doing fine.
RORY: I just don't want your father to be disappointed in me.
LOGAN: Rory, in order for my dad to be truly disappointed in you, your name would have to be Logan.
RORY: I'm sure that's not true.
LOGAN: Uh-huh.
RORY: Thanks, Logan.
LOGAN: Go get ‘em, Ace.
[She hangs up and adds to her notes.]
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke serves Lorelai a plate of food.]
LORELAI: Oh my God, this smells good. What is this?
LUKE: It's nothing. Just some soft-shelled crab amandine on a bed of wild rice.
LORELAI: Okay. There is no sentence in the English language that begins with ‘it's nothing' and contains the word amandine. Happy. [Her cell phone rings.] Oh, my God, your girlfriend is so important. [She answers it.] Hello?
RICHARD: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hey, Dad.
RICHARD: Something very remarkable happened today. I got a call from someone wanting to know if I was Lorelai Gilmore's father.
LORELAI: Really?
RICHARD: Outside the context of trouble at school, that's the first time anyone's ever asked me that.
LORELAI: And why did someone ask you that?
RICHARD: Well, one of our clients is the Durham Group. Do you know them?
LORELAI: They, um, own hotels?
RICHARD: They own boutique inns. The CEO, Mike Armstrong, is good friends with Twee Silverman, who is the publisher of American Travel. It seems there's quite an article coming out about you and Sookie and your success at the Dragonfly. According to Twee, it's the cover story of the May issue.
LORELAI [troubled, to Luke]: The article's coming out! Uh, Dad, did your guy happen to talk about what's in the article?
RICHARD: I don't think he read it. Twee clued him in because she knows he's always looking for up-and-comers. Apparently, you are an up-and-comer.
LORELAI [to Luke]: I'm an up-and-comer!
RICHARD: Long story short, Lorelai, Mike Armstrong would like to take a meeting with you.
LORELAI: Why?
RICHARD: Well, he's in the inn business. I assume he wants to offer you some sort of job.
LORELAI: Dad, I have a job. Apparently you can read all about it in May.
RICHARD: He asked if you traveled much.
LORELAI: He wants to know where I go on vacation?
RICHARD: Well, he was referring to business travel. Perhaps the position involves travel. Do you travel? I wasn't really sure.
LORELAI: Well, the liquor store is a little further out than I'd like, but –
RICHARD: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Yeah, Dad. I travel. Sometimes.
RICHARD: Well, good! I'll have my secretary fax the contact information to your home fax tonight and you can call him in the morning.
LORELAI: Dad, I don't have a home fax.
RICHARD: I don't see how you can do business on this level and not have a home fax.
LORELAI: Yeah, we're all confounded by that, yes.
RICHARD: Call my office in the morning. I'm quite proud of you, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Thanks, Dad.
[She flips her phone shut.]
LORELAI: They're running the article!
LUKE: Good, I'm glad that they're running the article. I never liked that you pulled it.
LORELAI: Yes, well, if you recall, I pulled it only after I suggested my mother might have been personally responsible for global warming!
LUKE: Are you seriously worried that things might get worse between you and your mother?
LORELAI: Good point.
LUKE: So what's all this stuff about you traveling?
LORELAI: Oh, some guy my dad knows wants to offer me a job and apparently there's travel involved.
LUKE: You have a job.
LORELAI: I know, but companies like this would probably want to buy the inn and, I don't know, keep me on to manage it, or send me out as a consultant.
LUKE: Buy the inn, you just opened the inn!
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: You don't want to sell the inn!
LORELAI: I know!
LUKE: I mean, who are these people, coming in from out of the blue with this stuff?
LORELAI: I don't know. It's just some guy who called my dad and wants to meet me.
LUKE: Well, this is crazy. You don't want to meet with this guy.
LORELAI: Luke, I'm not interested, so it doesn't matter. I have no intention of meeting with this guy. I'm happy with what I've got.
LUKE: Good.
[There is silence for a moment. Luke appears to be thinking.]
LUKE: You know what? You should meet with this guy.
LORELAI: My daughter, my sister, my daughter, my sister, my daughter –
LUKE: I'm serious. Even if you're not interested, I mean, it's good people are talking about you and your business. I mean, just take the meeting. It's – it's contacts. It's networking. Right? That's the right word, networking?
LORELAI: I think.
LUKE: Well, then you should network.
LORELAI: All right. Well, I'll think about it.
LUKE: Good, good.
LORELAI [pointing at the food]: Good.
[Luke smiles.]
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE
[The maid, b*at, is setting the table. Emily enters.]
EMILY: b*at.
b*at: Yes, ma'am.
EMILY: Do you know what these are?
b*at: Lilies.
EMILY: Fragrant lilies. Would you like to eat dinner with fragrant lilies in the room?
b*at: Yes.
EMILY: Well, then you're insane! I don't know how you think my guests are supposed to enjoy their dinner with this floral reek wafting up their noses! Move them to the living room and bring the peonies in here.
b*at: Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.
[She carries the flowers away. Richard enters.]
RICHARD: Everything looks lovely.
EMILY: Does it?
RICHARD: Yes, and so do you. What's on the dinner menu tonight?
EMILY [straightening his bow tie]: Roast beef. Oh, I hope Logan's not some kind of vegetarian.
RICHARD: Well, his grandfather owned ten thousand head of cattle. I sincerely doubt it. You know, I've just been thinking. The Huntzbergers will all be transferring down to Martha's Vineyard soon.
EMILY: Mid-June, every year. I'm sure Logan's there for some of that.
RICHARD: They have six acres there. It's quite a spread.
EMILY: They've held their share of functions down there, too. Graduations, parties, weddings.
RICHARD: Maybe it's time for us, Emily.
EMILY: Time for what?
RICHARD: Time to acquire an acreage. A compound for the extended family.
EMILY: A place on Cape Cod!
RICHARD: Our own Kennebunkport. Get it all ready for the next generation.
EMILY: The Cape's as good as the Vineyard for a wedding.
RICHARD: Or some would say better.
EMILY: Sandier beaches, too. Children love sandy beaches. Just love running and playing on them.
[The doorbell rings.]
RICHARD: Oh, damn. I forgot to fill the ice bucket.
EMILY: Go get, it. I'll get the door.
[They turn to go. Emily turns back.]
EMILY: Richard! Picture his blond hair and her blue eyes on a little baby!
RICHARD: Incomparable!
[Emily answers the door. It is Lorelai. Emily is visibly disappointed.]
LORELAI: Hi, Mom.
EMILY: Oh. Come in.
LORELAI: Thanks.
[She takes off her coat.]
EMILY [walking away, she calls out]: b*at, take my daughter's coat!
[b*at does.]
LORELAI [awkwardly]: Thank you.
[She follows Emily into the dining room.]
EMILY: What are you doing here?
LORELAI: I don't know, I just followed you.
EMILY: Richard, come out here and sit with Lorelai.
RICHARD [OS]: Coming!
LORELAI: Mom, it's okay. I can sit by myself.
RICHARD [enters with the ice bucket]: You need me to sit with Lorelai?
LORELAI: I'm fine. I swear. I have been sitting without any help since I was two and a half.
RICHARD: No, that's all right. I don't mind. Come along.
[They enter the living room.]
RICHARD: Please, sit. Sit.
LORELAI: There's a lot of pressure to do it right now.
RICHARD: So, did you ring Mike Armstrong?
LORELAI: I did. We have a meeting set up for tomorrow.
RICHARD: Oh, good. Good, I'm glad. Mike is very big in that business. I think you'll find him a valuable –
EMILY [OS]: Richard! I need help in here!
RICHARD: I'm sitting with Lorelai, Emily!
LORELAI: Dad, really. It's okay. I promise not to stick my finger in any sockets.
RICHARD: Well, all right. [To Emily] Here I come. What sort of help do you need, my dear?
[Lorelai sighs, alone in the living room.]
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Logan and Rory get out of his car. Logan rushes around to open her car door, but she b*at him to it.]
RORY: You know, you're not obligated to be polite until we're actually inside my grandparents' house.
LOGAN: Good. Allow me to use these brief moments of time to make disgusting noises with my armpits.
RORY: Oh, would you? So, this is going to be quick and painless. Believe me, my grandparents like you better than they liked Ronald Reagan.
LOGAN: Wow. High praise.
[He takes two gift wrapped boxes out of the back seat.]
RORY: What are those?
LOGAN: Hostess gifts. Never a bad idea to bring hostess gifts.
RORY: Well played, Huntzberger!
LOGAN: So what about your mom? She going to be cool?
RORY: Of course she'll be cool. She's the essence of cool. Cool's her street name. She's got it monogrammed on her towels and everything.
LOGAN: Well, if she's got it monogrammed on her towels, there's nothing to worry about.
[Rory rings the doorbell.]
RORY: What'd you bring, anyway?
LOGAN: Cigars for Richard, chocolates for Emily, and Mrs. Eleanor Shubick's silver lighter.
RORY: Huh? What's that for?
[Emily and Richard answer the door.]
EMILY: Rory! Logan, welcome!
RICHARD: Come in, come in!
RORY: Hi, Grandma!
EMILY: Hello! And our guest of honor.
RICHARD: L'invité d'honneur.
LOGAN: How are you, Richard? Emily?
EMILY: Wonderful, now.
RICHARD: Yes, wonderful.
EMILY: Oh, look at you two, you're just perfect. Aren't they perfect, Richard?
RICHARD: Perfect.
RORY: We're not perfect.
EMILY: Nonsense, you're perfect!
LOGAN: No, she's right. I've got split ends like you wouldn't believe.
[Emily and Richard laugh.]
RICHARD: And a sense of humor.
LOGAN: Emily, these are for you. A small token of my gratitude.
EMILY: Vunderschen chocolates, I absolutely adore these!
LOGAN: I picked them up last time I was in Switzerland.
EMILY: Well, aren't you clever.
LOGAN: And here's a little something for you, sir.
RICHARD: Oh, Romeo y Julietas. You are a good man, Logan Huntzberger!
EMILY: Come on, let's all go in the living room, shall we?
[Emily takes Logan's arm, and Richard takes Rory's. They enter the living room.]
EMILY: I just adore this jacket you're wearing. Isn't this a fine jacket, Richard?
RICHARD: Oh, I like how the lapels are cut. Aren't those nice lapels, Rory?
RORY: Uh, sure, Grandpa. His lapels look great.
RICHARD: Most modern tailors cut lapels too low. It's so sloppy, having one's lapels hang down around the chest like a basset hound's ears or something.
EMILY: But those are excellent.
RICHARD: Oh, they really are.
RORY [notices Lorelai]: Hi, Mom.
LORELAI: Hey, how am I sitting?
RORY: Great. Mom, you remember –
EMILY: Logan, this is Rory's mother, Lorelai. Lorelai, this is Logan Huntzberger.
LORELAI: Yes, we've met, actually. Nice to see you again, Logan.
LOGAN: Nice to see you.
EMILY: Come on, sit, sit, sit. Let's get drink orders.
RICHARD: Mm.
EMILY: Logan, what will you have?
LOGAN: McKellen neat, if you have it.
EMILY: Oh, I adore a man who drinks his scotch neat.
RICHARD: That is a fine drink indeed.
EMILY: Rory?
RORY: Just club soda.
EMILY: So demure. Isn't she demure?
LOGAN: The demurest.
RICHARD: One club soda.
EMILY: And your usual, Lorelai? A sidecar?
LORELAI: Sidecar? No.
EMILY: Isn't that your drink?
LORELAI: No, my drink is a martini. It's always been a martini.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: Yes. Pretty much every one of the other eight thousand times I've had a drink here it's been a martini.
EMILY: I would've sworn you were a sidecar girl.
LORELAI: Not even sure what's in a sidecar, Mom.
EMILY: Well, Richard, apparently Lorelai would like a martini.
RICHARD: Can do.
EMILY: I just can't get over those lapels.
RORY: Grandma and Grandpa are very taken with Logan's lapels.
LORELAI: They look fine to me.
EMILY: You'll have to excuse Lorelai, Logan. It takes a certain eye to be aware of this kind of thing.
RICHARD: One scotch neat, and a club soda.
LOGAN: Thank you.
RORY: Thanks, Grandpa.
RICHARD: And one martini. [He returns to the bar to make it.]
EMILY: That's with a twist, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Nope. An olive.
EMILY: In a vodka martini?
LORELAI: Not vodka, Mom. Gin. It's always been gin. Gin martini.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: Yes! Always!
EMILY: I don't remember that at all.
LORELAI: Uh, so. Logan. Where exactly do you live at Yale? Are you in Rory's building?
LOGAN: No, I'm at Berkeley.
LORELAI: Is that far from Rory?
LOGAN: No, I'd say it's about ninety Kropogs or so.
RICHARD: Kropogs! Did somebody say Kropogs?
EMILY [laughing]: Kropogs. Now that is clever.
[Everyone laughs.]
LORELAI: Uh, fill me in here. What's a Kropog?
LOGAN: Years ago, someone at Yale started measuring things based on the height of a kid named Kropog.
RICHARD [sitting down]: I can't believe that today's Elis are still using Kropogs. Now that is really something. Maxwell T. Kropog was his name, class of forty-four. Oh, Lorelai, I'm sorry. I forgot your drink. I made it and everything.
LORELAI: Well, you remembered now.
[Richard starts to get up.]
EMILY: No, Richard, stay, I'll get it.
RICHARD: I'm glad to hear that Kropog is still part of the Yale vernacular. Tradition is so important.
RORY: Why don't we talk about something other than Yale?
EMILY: Nonsense, there's nothing better to talk about than Yale. Because Yale men are the greatest. I dated a few Princeton men and a Harvard man back in my day, and they had nothing on Yale men.
RICHARD: They'd better not.
EMILY [handing Lorelai her drink]: Here you go, Lorelai.
[Lorelai takes the martini, looks at it, and looks back at Emily.]
LORELAI: Mom, there's an onion in here.
EMILY: Is that not what you wanted?
LORELAI: Olive. I said olive.
EMILY: Well, I heard onion.
LORELAI: Well, I said olive.
EMILY [glances at Logan and gets up]: Let me get you an olive.
LATER
[Lorelai sadly holds her empty martini glass.]
EMILY: And the racquets have changed too. Honestly, the people at the club must have thought I was there to play badminton when I showed up with my old wooden thing.
LOGAN: Oh, you have to get a new racquet, Emily. The materials available today make all the difference.
RICHARD: I told her the same thing.
LOGAN: I know this guy, he's one of the top manufacturers of ceramic racquets. Pete Sampras loves them. I could totally set you up.
EMILY: Did you hear that, Richard? Logan can set me up!
RICHARD: Well, how about that!
b*at [entering]: Dinner is ready, Mrs. Gilmore.
RICHARD: Well, shall we?
EMILY: I'm just going to pop into the kitchen to check on a thing or two. Richard, will you come carve the roast?
RICHARD: Certainly.
LORELAI: Is there going to be alcohol with dinner, Mom?
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: You know, booze? ‘Cause I haven't been able to get even a Kropog of gin since that first drink.
RICHARD: A Kropog is a unit of distance, Lorelai. Not volume.
EMILY: And there'll be wine with the meal. There's always wine with the meal, Lorelai! Honestly! You're acting as if you've never been here.
[Emily and Richard walk out.]
LORELAI: Sorry. Just wasn't sure.
[Rory, Logan and Lorelai stare awkwardly at the table.]
LOGAN: Roast. Sounds good.
RORY: It does.
LORELAI: Yeah. Who doesn't like a good roast?
[They get up to go into the dining room. Lorelai goes ahead, but is still within earshot. Logan holds Rory back.]
RORY: What are you doing?
LOGAN: A little Life and Death Brigade business. Every time we're in a rich person's house we take a knick-knack. Then I leave the knick-knack I took from the last rich person's house. I've been doing this up and down the eastern seaboard for years.
[He picks up a small box from a table, replaces it with the lighter from his pocket, and takes the box. Lorelai sees this, and disapproves, but goes into the living room without saying anything.]
RORY: Logan, no.
LOGAN: Trust me. They never notice.
RORY [smiling]: You're crazy!
LOGAN: It's fun to be crazy.
[They join Lorelai in the dining room.]
RORY [referring to the chairs on the side of the table]: Grandma probably wants us here.
EMILY [entering]: All right, the salads will be out in just a moment. Everybody, sit.
[Emily walks around the table, then stops, staring at the living room.]
EMILY: Wait a minute.
RICHARD: What's wrong, Emily?
EMILY [walking into the living room]: Well, I don't know. Wait. My antique sewing box! It's missing!
RICHARD: Well, that can't be.
EMILY: It is! It's gone! Was it here during drinks?
RICHARD: Well, I can't say that I noticed.
[b*at approaches.]
EMILY: You, hovering there! What do you know about this?
b*at: Ma'am?
EMILY: My antique sewing box. Did you move it somewhere?
b*at: No.
EMILY: And yet it's not here. Do you have any explanation as to why it's not here, b*at?
LORELAI [from the table]: I'm sure it's just a mix-up, Mom.
EMILY: And – what's this? What's this lighter? Richard, is this from the pool house?
[Lorelai glares across the table at Logan.]
RICHARD: Well, I don't recognize it, but, well, you never know. One of the guys might have left it after a poker game.
EMILY: Well, b*at. I don't know what to say. I almost feel like I should go through the whole house and make sure nothing else has been misplaced.
LORELAI: Mom, I found it.
EMILY [not hearing her]: However, we have company and I don't want to be rude.
[Lorelai holds out her hand to Logan. He hesitates, and then gives her the box.]
EMILY: Let's just leave it for later and then you and I will have a very serious discussion.
LORELAI: Mom, I found it!
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: Yeah, here it is.
EMILY: Really? Where was it?
LORELAI: Behind the centerpiece. I guess the flowers kind of hid it.
EMILY: Behind the centerpiece?
[b*at sees the box, and smiles.]
EMILY: What on earth are you smiling about?
b*at: I'm just glad you found it.
EMILY: Would you please go into the kitchen and bring out the salad course? [b*at leaves. Emily sits down.] Rory, Logan, I'm so sorry.
RICHARD: Well, never a dull moment, as we say.
EMILY: Ah, here we are. Avocado salad with beet dressing.
[b*at serves the salad.]
RICHARD: Oh, wonderful. I'm starving.
[Lorelai, Logan and Rory exchange looks. Rory looks ashamed, Lorelai looks angry and Logan looks defiant.]



LATER
[Dessert and coffee time.]
LOGAN: Believe me, Rory's the real star at the Yale Daily News. People hate her.
EMILY: They hate you?
RORY: I'm not hated. Am I hated?
LOGAN: She's had more pieces printed above the fold this year than anyone.
RICHARD: Well, you are both enormously talented. Because if you have one tenth of your father's ability, young man, you are going to go straight to the top.
EMILY: A power couple. That's what you are.
RICHARD: We were thrilled to hear that Rory is going to be working with your father, Logan.
RORY: I'm not really working with him. Just near him, more like.
LOGAN: She's knocking them dead over there. Now if I can just get her to relax.
RORY: I relax.
EMILY: Speaking of relaxation, does your family still have their place on Martha's Vineyard?
LOGAN: I think they bought it from Martha. They're not giving that up. It's not going anywhere.
EMILY: It's lovely in the vineyard. A few years ago, Richard and I attended a wedding there. I thought there could be no more gorgeous a spot for a wedding.
LOGAN: It's beautiful.
EMILY: But then we went to one on Cape Cod and it was wonderful too. Either place would be good for a wedding, don't you think?
[Lorelai glares.]
LOGAN: Sure, I've been to weddings at the Cape myself.
EMILY: So you like Cape Cod?
LOGAN: Yes.
EMILY: We like Cape Cod.
RICHARD [nodding]: Mm.
LOGAN: Great.
EMILY: And I know Rory would like Cape Cod.
RORY: I like what I've seen in pictures.
EMILY: You two would look awfully cute in Cape Cod.
[Logan grins.]
LORELAI: Mom, did you get a job at the Cape Cod chamber of commerce?
EMILY: No. [To Logan] There are a lot of kids in your family, aren't there?
LOGAN: Yeah. The extended family's been pretty busy procreating lately.
RICHARD: They have, have they?
EMILY: Do you like kids?
LOGAN: Sure.
EMILY: Kids love Cape Cod.
LORELAI: I think internships are a Communist plot.
RICHARD: What?
LORELAI: Forcing someone to work without pay? It's a little Pinko, isn't it? I mean, where's Roy Cohn when you need him?
EMILY: Have you lost your mind?
LORELAI [shaking her head around]: No, no. It's still sloshing around up there.
EMILY: Would you like another apple, Rory?
RORY: Oh, no thanks. They were really good, though.
EMILY: How about you, Logan? Apple?
LOGAN: Thank you, but I don't think I could eat another thing, and unfortunately we should be going. I have an early day tomorrow.
EMILY: Oh, Logan, an early day. I'm so sorry we kept you.
LOGAN: I wish I could stay longer.
EMILY: An early day is an early day. b*at, get their coats.
[Everyone gets up.]
LOGAN: I had a wonderful time. Thank you so much.
RORY: Yes, thank you, Grandma and Grandpa. It was great.
EMILY: Of course. We had a wonderful time too.
RORY [hugs Lorelai]: Bye, Mom.
LORELAI: Bye, hon. Goodnight, Logan. [They shake hands.]
LOGAN: Nice to see you again.
LORELAI: Nice seeing you again, too. I hope we can all do this –
EMILY: Lorelai, don't keep them. Logan has an early day tomorrow.
LORELAI: Sorry.
[Emily and Richard walk Rory and Logan to the door. Lorelai stays in the dining room. She sits at the table and leans her head in her hands.]
EMILY [OS]: Now, I'm going to hold you to your promise about that tennis racquet.
LOGAN [OS]: Oh, absolutely. I'll call you this week, or maybe I'll just sh**t you an e-mail.
EMILY [OS]: sh**t me an e-mail. That is so clever.
RICHARD [OS]: That's good business sense, too. You have to utilize the latest technology or you'll fall behind.
[The door opens.]
EMILY [OS]: Now, would you look at that! What a cunning little car! I adore sports coupes.
RICHARD [OS]: Fine parking job, too.
[Lorelai rolls her eyes.]
RORY [OS]: Well, good bye, Grandma and Grandpa.
LOGAN [OS]: Thanks again.
EMILY [OS]: Good night, you two. Drive safe!
[They return to the dining room.]
EMILY: More coffee, Lorelai?
LORELAI: No. Thank you.
[Emily and Richard sit down. Lorelai looks at Emily.]
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: Um, nothing. Just on those National Geographic shows, people are so sweaty after a mating ritual. But you two are powder dry.
EMILY: What on earth are you talking about?
LORELAI: They're just kids, and they're still figuring things out, and they don't need you two dropping all these heavy-handed hints about weddings and babies and Cape Cod.
EMILY: You should be thrilled by this match, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Well, who says I'm not thrilled?
RICHARD: Well, you're not acting very thrilled.
LORELAI: I'm annoyed at you. That's why. Putting all this pressure on them? They are in their early twenties, for God's sake.
EMILY: You are letting your own personal tastes cloud your judgment of this boy. He is perfect for Rory, and you don't see it!
LORELAI: This is not about my personal taste!
EMILY: You're uncomfortable around people like Logan. He's not your type. That's well documented.
LORELAI: Oh, that was a nice not-so-subtle dig at Luke.
EMILY: Luke?
RICHARD: Who said anything about Luke?
EMILY: You're very sensitive tonight.
LORELAI: I'm not sensitive. It's just you're busy marrying Rory off into a family that wasn't even nice to her!
RICHARD: Who wasn't nice to her?
LORELAI: The Huntzbergers. She went over there for dinner and they treated her like trash.
RICHARD: I highly doubt that.
LORELAI: Well, they did!
RICHARD: If the Huntzbergers were so horrible to Rory, why on earth did Mitchum give her a very valuable internship?
LORELAI: He was buying her off.
RICHARD: So, the internship was like hush money?
LORELAI: Yes!
RICHARD: There's no money! It's an unpaid position!
LORELAI: It's a figure of speech.
RICHARD: Rory got this internship by making a contact. In a way, similar to me setting you up with Mike Armstrong. Is there something wrong with that?
LORELAI: No.
RICHARD: I concur.
LORELAI: There is still something wrong with this internship.
EMILY: My God, you're paranoid.
LORELAI: I am not paranoid! And Logan did not have an early day!
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: What twenty-two year old has an early day on a Saturday?
EMILY: Why are you so hell-bent on derailing this match?
RICHARD: They're perfect for each other!
LORELAI: Okay, that word, perfect, he is not. I mean, no one is, okay, but especially him! I mean, at your wedding, I caught him and Rory in the back room [she hesitates] uh, kissing.
[Emily and Richard do not look concerned.]
LORELAI [with emphasis]: Kissing.
RICHARD: You have something against kissing?
EMILY: I never thought of you as a prude.
RICHARD: Paranoid, not a prude.
LORELAI: He stole your sewing box.
EMILY: The sewing box is sitting on the table in the living room, Lorelai.
LORELAI: No, no. He's just a –
RICHARD: Are we done here?
LORELAI: No!
RICHARD: Good. I have a call to make. You might want that cup of coffee. Clear your head a bit before you drive home. [He leaves the table.]
EMILY: Or maybe you've just had one too many sidecars. [She leaves.]
STAMFORD EAGLE GAZETTE
[Rory waits by the elevator. It opens. Rory walks confidently along with Mitchum and the manager
MANAGER: So it's not necessarily a diminishment of personnel.
MITCHUM: No, that's the advantage of using crewed reporting through the whole syndicate. By sharing the resources, you're going to have more options. With more options, you're going to be less reliant on the wire services. People will only read so many flatly written wire stories before they catch on and start reading something else, or worse, turn on the T.V.
RORY [holds out a cup]: Coffee?
MITCHUM [glances at his watch]: Uh –
RORY: It's decaf.
MITCHUM: Oh. Well, thank you. [He takes a sip.] It's good. All right, let's take a look at that editorial budget.
[The group walks into a meeting room. Rory stands outside.]
MITCHUM [OS]: What are you waiting for, Gilmore, an engraved invitation?
[Rory smiles and enters the meeting.]
SOOKIE'S HOUSE
[Lorelai and Sookie are sampling Manny's cooking. They each take a bite.]
SOOKIE: Good!
LORELAI: Very good!
SOOKIE: I'd say it's a nine.
LORELAI: Nine plus.
SOOKIE: What would make it a ten?
LORELAI: Another half a point.
SOOKIE [giggles]: Lemon juice and a handful of parsley.
LORELAI: Yes. A tart fresh taste.
SOOKIE [calls into the kitchen]: Manny, try a little lemon juice and parsley!
MANNY: Okay!
LORELAI: How long are you going to have him working here?
SOOKIE: Well, with that fancy pants article coming out about us, I want to make sure that the food stays top-notch.
LORELAI: You know, Mike Armstrong called again.
SOOKIE: Really? That's the second time since the meeting, isn't it?
LORELAI: Yeah. He's, like, open to any option. Buying the inn, or just investing in the inn –
SOOKIE: We'd have money again. Remember what it was like to have money?
LORELAI: He'd be keeping us on to run it. We could consult. We could travelaround the world telling other people how to run their inns –
SOOKIE: We could be bossy. Oh, we could travel and be bossy!
LORELAI: He mentioned the south of France. Apparently they're making a huge investment there and they have a need for people like us.
SOOKIE: I can picture us in the south of France, oh, topless!
LORELAI: At work?
SOOKIE: No. We're on the beach.
LORELAI: Much more appropriate.
SOOKIE: And the casinos, oh, and the cheese!
LORELAI: You know, my dad traveled all over the world for work, which drove my mom crazy, which was a little perk. But he would always say things like ‘I'll be back from Düsseldorf on Friday'. And when I was a kid, I always wanted to say ‘I'll be back from Düsseldorf on Friday'!
SOOKIE: Oh, that would be great. To get into all those famous kitchens I've always read about.
LORELAI: We'd have expense accounts and travel luggage. It'd be exciting, huh?
SOOKIE: Yeah, it would!
[They smile at each other.]
SOOKIE: But, I can't do that. I have Davey and little No-name here, and Jackson. Jackson wouldn't want to go topless in France.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: My life is here.
LORELAI: Yeah, sure.
SOOKIE: But you could go.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Your kid's in college. You're young. You love to travel. You look amazing topless. [She giggles.] You could go. I mean, what's stopping you?
LORELAI: Well –
SOOKIE: Oh! Snap peas! Snap peas would be good in this! [She squeals.] Manny, snap peas!
MANNY [OS]: Snap peas.
SOOKIE: Snap peas. Yeah.
[Lorelai smiles.]

ELDER GILMORE'S DINING ROOM
[Lorelai, Rory and Emily are eating chocolate fondue.]
EMILY: This feels so decadent. Isn't this decadent?
RORY: Very decadent.
LORELAI: Are there more marshmallows?
EMILY: All you two have been dipping is the marshmallows! You haven't touched the kiwi, or the pineapple, or the tangelo slices.
RORY: But it's fruit.
EMILY: Fruit is good for you.
RORY: We're fondue purists, Grandma.
LORELAI: Yeah, we dip old school.
EMILY: The government says you should have nine servings of fruit and vegetables per day.
LORELAI: Imperialist propaganda.
RORY: I think Noam Chomsky would agree.
LORELAI: I bet Noam doesn't dip fruit.
RORY: Or laugh. Ever seen that punim on him?
LORELAI: Easter Island.
EMILY: Luminista, please bring more marshmallows.
LORELAI: Bless you.
EMILY: So, I'd love to get your opinion on something.
RORY: Sure.
EMILY: The City Ballet is in trouble. We've given so much over the years, but it's never enough to cover everything they need.
RORY: I hate that.
EMILY: So, we're trying something new. Select patrons, such as myself, are sponsoring individual dancers. Help me pick one.
[Emily opens up a blue folder next to her and hands Rory and Lorelai cards out of it.]
LORELAI: Pick what?
EMILY: My dancer! I get to take one home. Bios are on the back.
LORELAI: And this is legal?
EMILY: Of course it's legal.
RORY [shrugs]: Do you want a boy or a girl, Grandma?
EMILY: I'm thinking a little girl. Cute and petite.
RORY: They're all petite.
LORELAI: But not all cute. This one should fouetter over to the dermatologist.
EMILY: Oh, yes, I'd rather not look at that.
LORELAI: Really, Mom, this is a little bit creepy.
EMILY: It's not creepy! We're endowing dancers so that they don't have to worry about money. It's nice.
LORELAI: Well, Gregorio here looks pretty well-endowed already. [She passes his card to Rory.]
RORY: Here's a little cutie patootie. [She passes the card to Emily.]
EMILY: Oh, she's darling! Look at those little feet!
RORY [to Lorelai]: Whoa, you were right! This Gregorio guy, what's up with that?
EMILY: Rory!
LORELAI: Just a little girl talk, Mom. Who are we offending?
EMILY: Let's make two piles. One for the maybes, one for the nos.
LORELAI: Sandpaper face is a no?
EMILY: Definitely.
RORY: What about Endowment Boy?
EMILY [pause]: The maybes.
RORY: You go, Grandma.
LORELAI: I bet Gregorio would be good dipped in chocolate.
[Rory laughs. Emily looks on, disapprovingly.]
LORELAI: Sorry.
OPENING CREDITS
ELDER GILMORE'S MANSION – DRIVEWAY
[Rory and Lorelai are transferring boxes from Rory's trunk to the back of Lorelai's Jeep.]
LORELAI: I don't know. Adopting a ballet dancer? The whole thing sounds very shady.
RORY: It's good to support the arts any way we can, even the shady-sounding ways. Hey, you took my book bag! I need that!
LORELAI: Oops, sorry. [She pulls the book bag out of her Jeep.] So you really think that transferring your stuff bit by bit like this is the way to go, huh? Easier than renting something, doing it all at once?
RORY: Oh, you really want to re-live the U-haul incident of May 2004?
LORELAI [indignant]: Ah! You make one iffy u-turn.
RORY: We were in a tunnel!
LORELAI: A wide tunnel.
RORY: Going the wrong way down a one-way street.
LORELAI: They don't let you forget.
RORY: Yeah, I've got that elephant's memory when it comes to nearly dying. Hey, you took my book bag again!
LORELAI: Ah!
RORY: So, hey. Let's finalize our plans for Thursday.
LORELAI: Right. So Jackson says that Sookie has been napping between eleven and twelve-thirty every day. We can count on it.
RORY: Must be nice to nap without feeling guilty.
LORELAI: Get pregnant and you'll have an excuse.
RORY: No thanks.
LORELAI: So, meet me at their house at noon. Bring decorations and she'll wake up to a nice, fun, surprise baby shower.
RORY: You got it.
LORELAI: I think it's cool we waited this long to throw it. She's totally not going to expect it.
RORY: Plus we forgot.
LORELAI: But only we know that.
RORY: And I'm not telling.
LORELAI: Good. Bye, hon.
[They kiss on the cheek. Rory closes her trunk.]
RORY: Mom, my purse!
LORELAI: Oh, sorry.
[She gestures hopelessly at the packed-full Jeep.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Kirk is sitting at one of the tables.]
KIRK: Luke, can I have a word with you?
LUKE: Yes.
KIRK: You overcharged me for the toast. It's only supposed to be a dollar.
LUKE: I didn't overcharge you, Kirk. I raised the price of wheat toast. It's a dollar ten.
KIRK: You're kidding.
LUKE: I don't do toast humor.
KIRK: A dollar ten from a dollar? That's a ten percent bump.
LUKE: It's a dime, Kirk.
KIRK: I could refuse to pay.
LUKE: Then I'll steal your bike.
KIRK: That's never worked before.
LUKE: I haven't raised the price of my toast in seven years, Kirk. It's still a bargain.
KIRK: I'll give you a dollar four.
LUKE: No.
KIRK: A dollar five. That's my last offer.
LUKE: Do I look like E-bay?
KIRK: I take my toast dry. Isn't there a butter and jam discount?
LUKE: No.
KIRK: What about your chairs? I'm light, and I tend to plop my butt directly on the chair without sliding, so there's practically no wear and tear.
LUKE: There's no discount for direct butt-plopping.
KIRK: What about –
LUKE: Fine. A dollar five. It's a dollar five. You got it.
KIRK: Thanks. That's very nice of you.
[Lorelai enters.]
LORELAI: Hey!
[They kiss.]
LUKE: You raise something from a dollar to a dollar ten, is that such a big deal?
LORELAI: Well, that's ten percent, so percentage-wise it's not so tiny –
[Luke and Kirk gesture at each other.]
LORELAI: Did I step into something here?
LUKE: You know, I shouldn't have gotten into a business that involves dealing with people. [He points at Kirk above his head.]
LORELAI: Hey. [She holds up a magazine.]
LUKE: Hey! Your cover!
LORELAI: I got an advance copy!
LUKE: Oh, look at the inn! It looks beautiful.
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: I've got to get a new pair of pants.
LORELAI: Okay. That didn't exactly follow.
LUKE: You know, for the party they're going to throw you.
LORELAI: You don't need new pants. You just need pants. And the party's in New York, so you may not even need pants.
LUKE: I've got to get a copy.
LORELAI [hands him a copy]: You've got a connection.
LUKE: I want to get a bunch, though. Frame one or two of them. How's the article? What's it say?
LORELAI: It was then, sadly, that I discovered Luke could not read.
LUKE: You know what I mean.
LORELAI: People are going to think I wrote it. I mean, it's big. I nearly cried when I read it.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: And the fact that when Emily Gilmore reads it, she's going to hire men to attack me with tire irons, well, that's something else altogether.
LUKE: What'd they put in?
LORELAI: Not every heinous thing I said about her, but enough. I mean, it's good stuff, it's funny. Maybe if I just told them not the face.
LUKE: Who?
LORELAI: The guys, with the tire irons.
LUKE: I think you should just show it to her and get it over with.
LORELAI: Mm, maybe. Yeah. You're probably right.
[The phone rings. Caesar picks it up.]
CAESAR: Hello. [Pause] Hold on. [He presses the phone to his chest.] Hey, Luke, it's for you. It's Taylor.
LORELAI: Caesar! You just broke Luke's standing ‘when Taylor calls I'm out even if he can see me through the stupid connecting window' rule.
[Taylor gestures excitedly through the window.]
CAESAR: I can tell him you're out, and that Duke, your evil identical twin is in town.
LUKE: No, no. I'll take it. I actually have to discuss something with him. [He takes the phone.] Hello.
TAYLOR: Luke! Hey, buddy!
LUKE: Hey. Buddy.
TAYLOR: So the powers that be have signed off on you purchasing the Twickham house! All that's left is dotting the i's and crossing the t's.
LUKE [calmly]: Okay. Fine.
TAYLOR: Ooh, sorry. Lorelai's there, can't talk now, right?
LUKE: Pretty much.
TAYLOR: You know I'm a bit of a romantic, Luke. The thought of you buying this house for your burgeoning family is quite touching. I almost tear up. Heh. Adds to the tax base, too.
LUKE: Well, good. Talk to you later.
TAYLOR: Goodbye!
[They hang up.]
LORELAI: Wow. You and Taylor seem to be getting on very well these days.
LUKE: Yeah, well. He's been cooperating with me on certain matters.
KIRK [at a table]: Luke! I think the sales tax is off by a penny! In fact, I'm sure of it. I'm ready to go to the mat on this one.
LUKE [to Lorelai]: Those guys with the tire irons. Where did your mother get them?
LORELAI: The D.A.R. And they don't work for outsiders.
LUKE [sighs]: Show me the penny, Kirk.
STAMFORD EAGLE GAZETTE
[Rory gets off the elevator with her arms full of files. She smiles at some men that walk by, and begins hurrying around, busily.]
RORY: Hey, Al. Hey, Pete. Hey, Lance. [Hands a file to a woman.] This goes to metro, a.s.a.p.
WOMAN: Okay.
CHARLIE: Rory, if you see Patel, tell him I'm looking for him.
RORY: Got it.
[She delivers some files to an office full of reporters.]
RORY: Need ‘em back by five, gentlemen.
MAN: Thanks, beautiful.
RORY: Manners, boys.
HARRY: Rory, you got those obituaries?
RORY: Yeah, just give me five minutes.
HARRY: Lot of dying today.
RORY: I hear that.
[She hands off her last file to a man rushing down the hall.]
MAN: Thank you!
RORY: Oh, Patel. Charlie wants to see you.
PATEL: You remember Audrey?
RORY: I can.
PATEL: Give her this.
RORY: Okay, will do.
[Logan steps off the elevator.]
LOGAN: Hey, Ace!
RORY: Hey! You're early.
LOGAN: Well, there's a first for everything. Where's the fire?
RORY: Oh, just south of the ninety-five. It's a four-alarm. We've got Kessler on it. [She delivers the file to Audrey.] This is from Patel.
AUDREY: I'm not talking to him.
RORY: I'll tell him. [To Logan] How did you know about the fire?
LOGAN [laughing]: I didn't. I meant where are you going in such a hurry?
RORY: Oh. I'm at half-speed compared to this morning. [They arrive back at her workstation.] Oh, no.
LOGAN: What?
RORY: I'm gone for five minutes and this place becomes a dumping ground.
LOGAN: I'm loving the totally non-generic feel of your space, here.
RORY: I have customized it somewhat. [She points to a picture on the wall.]
LOGAN: Eccentric uncle?
RORY: Brian Eno.
LOGAN: I was close. So let's go.
RORY: It's four-thirty.
LOGAN: So cut out early. There's nothing going on here.
RORY: We're doing our rough front page. We're picking our leads, our photos. It's our busiest part of the day.
LOGAN: So the people of Stamford don't get their paper tomorrow, they'll turn on the radio.
RORY: I can't go.
LOGAN: I know the boss.
RORY: So do I.
LOGAN: But I know how to work the boss. At least a little. I know he's somewhere in the vicinity.
RORY: Who, your dad?
LOGAN: Can't you sense it? The flurry, the shuffle of sycophants –
MITCHUM: Hey! Someone new. Have we been introduced?
[They shake hands over the partition.]
LOGAN: Jose Canseco, post-steroids. Should be a warning to people.
MITCHUM: Are you keeping Rory from her work?
RORY: I was just about to call security.
MITCHUM: Does everyone know about the –
RORY: Noon on Friday, main conference room, come with your game.
MITCHUM: Good. [To Logan] You call your mother about the Vineyard?
LOGAN: She's on my list.
MITCHUM: Push him on that, won't you? [Rory nods.] I'm going to four if you want to catch up.
RORY: Okay.
MITCHUM: See you.
[Mitchum walks down the hall.]
LOGAN: Enjoy four. [To Rory] What's four?
RORY: Fourth floor.
LOGAN: You news people and your jargon.
RORY: We have our own language.
LOGAN: So he treating you all right?
RORY: Who, your dad? They've been great.
LOGAN: You sure?
RORY: Yeah?
LOGAN: Just checking. So what do you think about Friday.
RORY: An excellent alternative to Thursday.
LOGAN: My sister's engagement party?
RORY: Oh, right. I'm going to try. I'm dying to see the yacht.
LOGAN: Well, it's going to be full of Honor's ditzy friends, but the harbor's cool. Try and leave your grandparent's dinner early. They get you every Friday night, why not let me have one?
RORY: You're very one-note today.
LOGAN: Well, I miss you, Ace.
RORY: Well, I'll have more free time once finals are over and summer's here, unless I get that summer job here.
LOGAN: Well, you're probably a shoo-in. My father seems to like you.
RORY: Oh, I hope so! I love it here.
LOGAN: Okay. So, I'll just go hang somewhere till you're done?
RORY: I'll be done six-thirty, seven at the latest.
LOGAN [whining]: Ace!
RORY: Six forty-five.
[They kiss.]
LOGAN: So, maybe I'll be hanging on two, or five. Is that the right
terminology?
RORY: You're getting it!
[He leaves.]
NEW YORK STREET
[Luke and Lorelai are riding around in a limo.]
LORELAI: Come on! Please.
LUKE: I'm done.
LORELAI: No, you can't be done.
LUKE: I'm done!
LORELAI: There's more, I know it! It's germinating.
LUKE: I'm done, I'm at peace. There is no more. [Pause.] Just the smell of Manhattan!
LORELAI: I knew it. There was more.
LUKE: I mean, forget about the smells you can't identify. The ones you can identify are putrid! I mean, if it's not that rank smell of hot dog gushing out of those dirty sidewalk carts, it's the stench of the subway pouring out of the dirty grates! I mean, the manhole-cover steam? God knows what that steam is. You can't get a breath of fresh air!
LORELAI: Go, Luke! Rant, Luke!
LUKE: The whole city is a decaying heap. It's too many people crammed into too many buildings on too small a piece of land. It's an experiment that's failed. They should just give the whole island a push and float it over to Europe.
LORELAI: But after we see Spamalot! Right? I paid a lot for those tickets.
LUKE: I'm fine with an urban environment. But you need land around your space. Air to breathe. [He takes a deep breath.] I'm done again.
LORELAI: I love ranting Luke.
LUKE: Why does this song keep playing?
LORELAI: Because I put the CD player on repeat with my fancy remote in my fancy limo. Hey, do a limo rant. I bet that's a good one.
LUKE: No, that's right they sent you a limo. You deserve it.
LORELAI: And it enabled us to drink and not drive.
LUKE: That's good too.
LORELAI: Hey, I heard there was good food at this party.
LUKE: I heard that too.
LORELAI: Huh. Never made it to the food, did we?
LUKE: I had three peppermints I took from the bowl in the men's room, gave the attendant a five, ‘cause it's all I had.
LORELAI: Made it to the bar, though.
LUKE: Yeah. We should've eaten something before we went.
LORELAI: Who knew we'd keep missing the trays?
LUKE: But I'm not hungry. But I'm something, what am I?
LORELAI: You're drunk.
LUKE [laughs]: Right. I haven't been drunk in years.
LORELAI: Hey, have I thanked you enough for escorting me, and being such a good sport and shaking hands with all the big city folk you don't like, and putting extra cherries in my Manhattan?
LUKE: Yeah. You did.
LORELAI: There'll be more thanking. Later on tonight.
[They make out.]
LORELAI: Tastes like peppermint.
LUKE'S APARTMENT – NEXT MORNING
[Lorelai wakes up with Luke's arm over her. She gets up, wrapped in a sheet, and looks around. She finds her dress on the floor near the open door. She looks alarmed.]
SOOKIE'S HOUSE – OUTSIDE
[Lorelai walks around the front of Rory's car.]
LORELAI: Hi, you're late.
RORY [getting out of the car]: Sorry. Oh, it's only a little after noon. I'm not that late.
LORELAI: Well, we have very limited time during Sookie's nap, here. I just don't want to blow it. Hold on. [She notices the bags Rory is carrying.] You went to Doose's for baby shower decorations?
RORY: Well, I didn't know where else to go.
LORELAI: A decoration store.
RORY: Is there such a thing?
LORELAI: Yes. What did you get?
RORY: Um, poppers. Taylor had nine left.
LORELAI: Okay, well, there's ten of us, so someone doesn't get to pop.
RORY: Well, I'll pass on the pop. And there's plates, and cups, and –
LORELAI [grabbing the cups]: Chicks being hatched? That's Easter.
RORY: No, I know, but I figured hatching is birth, so we're right on topic there. Seventy percent off, too.
LORELAI: What else?
RORY: Uh, New Year's Eve balloons with Father Time and the New Year's baby on them. We'll blow them up and cheat the old man side to the wall so we can't see it, and then change the word ‘year' so it says ‘happy new baby'.
LORELAI: Oh, that's just sad.
RORY: Hey, what's with the attitude?
LORELAI: No attitude.
RORY: You've been Anne Sexton since I pulled up.
LORELAI: Sorry. Think I just slept a little funny. All right. Come on, let's get up in there while we still have the chance.
RORY: Okay.
[They begin to go into the house, but Sookie and Jackson burst through the door. Rory and Lorelai scream as they get pushed out of the way.]
JACKSON: Look out! Coming through!
SOOKIE: It's happening! It's happening!
LORELAI: Oh my God, it's happening?
RORY: You mean it's happening, happening?
SOOKIE: It's coming round the mountain.
RORY: Oh, I can't watch this!
JACKSON: Go get her suitcase! It's by the front door.
RORY: I'll grab her suitcase! [She runs into the house.]
SOOKIE: Oh, I'm freaking out Rory!
LORELAI: It's okay. She's a traditionalist. When she has a baby, she's going to be out in the waiting room, pacing and smoking.
RORY [returning with the suitcase]: We should have thrown her the baby shower earlier! Then I wouldn't have had to watch this.
SOOKIE [getting into the van]: Oh, you guys were going to throw me a baby shower?
LORELAI: We were going to set it up during your nap.
JACKSON: Want a boost?
SOOKIE: I can make it.
RORY [eyes closed tight]: Oh, God.
LORELAI: Watch it.
RORY: Sorry, I just really don't want to see what's coming round the mountain.
JACKSON [getting into the driver's seat]: See you guys at the hospital?
LORELAI: Yeah, you'll see me.
RORY: Yeah, I have to go back to Yale.
LORELAI: Plus she's thoroughly sickened by what's happening to you right now.
RORY: I'm not sickened, it's finals time. I'm stressed.
SOOKIE: Ooh! Contraction!
RORY: Oh, that's pretty sickening.
JACKSON: Hang on.
LORELAI: Sorry you didn't get your party.
SOOKIE: One little no-name to come.
JACKSON: We'll see you there.
LORELAI: See you there.
RORY: Mm-hm.
[Jackson and Sookie drive away. Lorelai looks at Rory, who still has her eyes squeezed shut.]
LORELAI: You are going to open your eyes when you drive back to Yale, right?
RORY: Yes. I'm just giving them a five minute head start. We're taking the same road.
LORELAI: Good thinking, honey. [She kisses her head.] Bye.
RORY: Bye.
[Lorelai leaves. Rory opens one eye and peeks down the street.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke serves coffee. Kirk is reading the paper and laughing.]
KIRK: I know he wants the bone. I know there's going to be a complication getting the bone, but Marmaduke still cracks me up every time.
[Luke fills Kirk's coffee cup.]
KIRK: Refills are still free, right?
LUKE: Yep. They're still free.
[The phone rings. Luke picks it up.]
LUKE: Luke's.
TAYLOR: Luke, it's Taylor.
LUKE: Oh, hey, Taylor, how's it going?
TAYLOR: Not so well. I mean, for you. It's going very well for me. I just had a group of German tourists come in and they've been shoveling it in since they sat down.
LUKE: What do you mean, it's not going well for me?
TAYLOR: It's the Twickham house. Someone has put in a competing offer.
LUKE: A competing – Taylor! You promised that house to me!
TAYLOR: And I did all that I could! But this other offer includes a substantial down payment in cash! The powers that be are seriously considering selling the house to this fellow townsman of yours!
LUKE: I'll up my offer.
TAYLOR: This guy'll just up his, then! He's got vast resources!
LUKE: How many resources can he have? He's living in Stars Hollow!
TAYLOR: Luke, he's willing to put down a quarter of a million dollars!
LUKE: What? That can't be right!
TAYLOR: That's what it is.
LUKE: I know everyone in this stinking town. What fellow townsman has a quarter of a million dollars in cash?
TAYLOR: I'm not sure I'm at liberty to say.
LUKE: Tell me, Taylor.
TAYLOR: Okay.
[Camera shows Luke's shocked expression.]
LUKE: Say that name again? [Pause. Blank stare.] I'll talk to you later.
[He walks over to Kirk's table.]
KIRK: Sally Forth is on fire today. On fire!
LUKE: Where did you get a quarter of a million dollars!
KIRK: What? I don't have a quarter of a million dollars.
LUKE: You don't?
KIRK: No. Just shy. It's $247, 868. Sixty-seven, if I get a couple of donuts to go. Those chocolate raised are calling my name.
LUKE: Where the hell did you get that much money?
KIRK: I've been working for eleven years, Luke. I've had fifteen thousand jobs. I've saved every dollar I've ever made. That and the miracle of compound interest has created a bounty of a quarter of a million dollars. Again, just under. I don't want to brag.
LUKE: You put a competing offer on the Twickham house.
KIRK: That's right. It's the perfect place for me and Lulu.
LUKE: You know I have an offer on that house.
KIRK [shrugs]: I've heard talk to that effect.
LUKE: Take it back. Take back the offer.
KIRK: No. You take yours back.
LUKE: I had a deal with Taylor before you even knew that house was available!
KIRK: You get it in writing?
LUKE: No! But –
KIRK: Mm. An oral agreement's only as good as the paper it's written on. Hey, that would be a good line for Dennis the Menace after he fails to mow Mr. Wilson's lawn. I should send that in.
LUKE: This is not going to go down this way. You are not getting that house.
KIRK: Au contraire, my friend. I happen to know that your credit's not exactly stellar.
LUKE: My credit?
KIRK: Granted, you've got some real estate holdings, but your cash flow's been flat for three years, and unless you're willing to sell off assets, you may be able to swing no more than a five percent down payment, which makes you a real estate risk.
LUKE: How do you know the state of my assets?
KIRK: That's the power of deep pockets, Luke. Put a solid buck in the right hands and they babble like parrots.
LUKE: Well, I am one of Stars Hollow Bank's oldest customers. I'm not anticipating any problems.
KIRK: Well, I'm Stars Hollow Bank's biggest customer. I think that means more.
LUKE: I don't believe this! You're swimming in cash and you fought me over a ten cent raise on toast!
KIRK: And you folded like a road map. That might explain the discrepancy in our net worths. So, I think I will have those donuts to go. You've got change for a hundred, right?
[Luke stares at him, then marches out, slamming the door.]
TAYLOR'S ICE CREAM SHOP
[Taylor is still serving the Germans.]
TAYLOR: Das ist gut, ya?
[Luke storms in.]
LUKE: I want to talk to the town elders!
TAYLOR: The town elders?
LUKE: You keep talking about the powers that be. That's the town elders, right?
TAYLOR: Yes.
LUKE: Well, they oversee the town assets, the real estate, I want to see them.
TAYLOR: They won't go for that, Luke.
LUKE: Why?
TAYLOR: It isn't how it's done! They don't deal with the public. They're the final arbiters. What they say goes.
LUKE: I'm seeing them.
TAYLOR: But –
LUKE: Arrange it.
[Luke glares, and then leaves.]
HOSPITAL – MATERNITY WARD
[Jackson is walking alongside Sookie, who is being pushed in a wheelchair by a nurse. Lorelai follows behind. They arrive at Sookie's room.]
JACKSON: Are you breathing, honey?
SOOKIE: I'm breathing. Hey, was that Andy Dick out in the hallway?
JACKSON: No, honey. This happened last time. You go into labor, you start thinking you see famous people.
SOOKIE: Right. Suddenly my midwife was Wolf Blitzer.
LORELAI: Hey, you need me to unpack you?
NURSE: You probably don't have to. We have everything she needs all set up. [She leaves the room.]
JACKSON: You know, we guys always pack a suitcase. Useless. So, have you been thinking about names? I'm leaning toward Ethan for a boy. Or Glenda if it's a girl. Although I like Martha, too. And Rupert for a boy.
SOOKIE: They're all good, sweetie.
JACKSON: Hey, whatever we don't use, we just save for the next one, right?
SOOKIE: Right, right. The next one.
JACKSON [to Lorelai]: Hey, will you stay with her? I've got to go call my most delivery guys and let them know what's happening.
LORELAI: Yep. I'll be here. [Jackson leaves.] Comfortable?
SOOKIE: I am, Penelope Cruz.
[They laugh. Lorelai pulls an apple out of her purse.]
SOOKIE: Really?
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: You're eating an apple?
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll put it away.
SOOKIE: No, eat! I'm just surprised, it's not your thing.
LORELAI: I know! But we were by a vending machine checking you in. It was there, and it looked good. [She takes a bite.]
SOOKIE: It does look good. Oh, it looks like Ben Stiller.
LORELAI: Hm. [She examines the apple.] Um, hey, Sookie, um, when did you know for sure?
SOOKIE: About what?
LORELAI: That you were pregnant. How could you tell?
SOOKIE: Don't you remember? ‘Norman Mailer!'
LORELAI: Mm. Right, right. Norman Mailer.
SOOKIE: I wonder how Norman is. I had a dream about him the other night, and he was yelling at someone to shut up and read Joyce.
LORELAI: How long was the Norman Mailer moment after you and Jackson, uh, conceived?
SOOKIE: Wow. Uh, well, I don't know, a few weeks?
LORELAI: It was weeks?
SOOKIE: I think.
LORELAI: And you didn't know before? Not a feeling, or anything?
SOOKIE: I don't know. You've had one before, don't you remember?
LORELAI: Yeah. It's been a while.
SOOKIE: Why are you asking?
LORELAI: Oh, I don't know. Just being in a maternity ward makes me wonder about these things.
NURSE [arriving]: I'm going to see how far along she is. We'll be a couple of minutes.
LORELAI: Oh, sure. [She whispers to Sookie] She looks like Marlo Thomas.
SOOKIE: See? It's not just me.
LORELAI: I'll be outside.
[Lorelai walks out into the waiting area. She interrupts a doctor who is walking by.]
LORELAI: Oh, excuse me, uh, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes.
LORELAI: Hi. You're not off to save a life, are you?
DOCTOR: Not at the moment.
LORELAI: Okay. Just, quick question. Um, pregnancy tests. What's the deal with them now? I haven't taken one in a couple of decades, and I was just wondering if they work any differently.
DOCTOR: No, they're more accurate now, but the process is similar.
LORELAI: Okay, so let's say you do it. Have sex. You know. How soon after can a test tell you anything?
DOCTOR: At least two weeks.
LORELAI: Not two days?
DOCTOR: It won't be definitive after just two days.
LORELAI: Boy. Sword of Damocles is really hovering over you for a couple weeks, there, huh?
DOCTOR: Pretty much.
LORELAI: Home tests can be pretty tricky, too. Can't buy one where I live, because people would see, and talk – it's a small town. And even afterwards, the garbage man could see the box in the trash, and blab, and you know, I like my garbage man, but again, it's a small town. It's not your problem. So, there's no machine?
DOCTOR: Machine?
LORELAI: Yeah, a machine you could stick me in. You know, putting pig vessels in people. Isn't there a machine that could tell me right away, away from the prying eyes of the garbage man?
DOCTOR: You really need to wait and take the test at the proper time.
LORELAI: Okay, see, I'm eating an apple. Now, normally, this would not be a sign of anything except hunger. Except I don't eat much fruit. I know I should, but I don't have a hankering for it. Had it when I was pregnant with my first kid, though. Kept craving those apples. And this morning, boy, was I craving an apple.
DOCTOR: Well, that could be a sign.
LORELAI: It could?
DOCTOR: Or not.
LORELAI: Okay. You're nice. You're sweet. I've taken up too much of your time. Thank you.
DOCTOR: No problem.
LORELAI: Okay.
[The doctor leaves her. Her cell phone rings.]
LORELAI: Hello?



[Scene cuts from Lorelai in the waiting room to Emily in her living room.]
EMILY: Lorelai, it's your mother. I just have a quick question.
LORELAI: Okay.
EMILY: Well, I got my ballerina.
LORELAI: Oh, which one? Sachenka?
EMILY: No, I waited too long, and Mitzi Hertford sure scooped her up. It's okay, because Sachenka tore a ligament last year and is probably washed up. I got Paola.
LORELAI: Oh, Paola.
EMILY: Blond hair, b*llet body. So petite, but thighs that could break concrete.
LORELAI: Sounds good.
EMILY: They delivered her this morning and I have to tell you, it's been so much fun! She speaks this charming broken English, and everything is so new and fresh to her.
LORELAI: I'm glad. So what's up?
EMILY: Well, Paola wandered into your room looking for the bathroom, she really doesn't know left from right, and she found that old toy of yours, the magic eight ball.
LORELAI: I can't believe that's still there.
EMILY: And she is mesmerized by it. She's been playing with it ever since, asking it questions. She won't put it down. And I was just wondering if I can let her keep it?
LORELAI: Oh, sure.
EMILY: It's practically glued to her hand.
LORELAI: Hmm. Whatever Paola wants, Paola gets.
EMILY: Good. Thank you!
PAOLA [from behind Emily]: It is yes! Yes! I'm going to be rich!
EMILY: I just want to hug the stuffing out of her! You'll meet her tomorrow night at dinner.
LORELAI: I'm looking forward to it.
EMILY: Bye, and thanks again!
LORELAI: Bye, Mom.
[She hangs up, and dials another number. Scene cuts to Rory in the dining hall at Yale.]
RORY: Hey, how's it going?
LORELAI: Oh, fine. She's all checked in, breathing normally, contracting painfully. The cursing should start any time now, everything's as it should be.
RORY: Good. I mean, that was weird, wasn't it? She was like, what, a week and a half early?
LORELAI: Yeah, those little buggers tend to come when they want to come.
RORY: I still can't get ‘coming round the mountain' out of my mind. It's like one of those phrases, like ‘drop it like it's hot' that I really wish I'd never heard.
LORELAI: Hey, um. [She glances at the guy sitting to her right, and gets up.] You're doing everything you need to do in that area, right?
RORY: What area?
LORELAI: Um, protection, to prevent something from coming round the mountain.
RORY: I hope so!
LORELAI: Hope? This is not an area where hope is good enough.
RORY: I think I have it covered, and that wasn't meant to be a euphemism.
LORELAI: Okay, ‘think' is not good enough either. What kind of birth control do you use?
RORY: Um. [She glances around her.] I'm in the dining hall!
LORELAI: That was not my question.
RORY: People are, like, three feet away from me.
LORELAI: Listen, all I'm saying is you cannot leave it up to the guy, okay? They are not reliable.
RORY: I don't leave it up to the guy!
LORELAI: They get into this state, you know? Primordial. It's all very exciting, but so is eating a gallon of pudding, and believe me, you are going to regret that later. I use that as an example because I know you like pudding.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: You have got to figure, if he sh**t, he scores. I mean, look around you. [She looks around.] There are babies popping out all over the place.
RORY: You are in a maternity ward! You've got a skewed sample there.
LORELAI: So you're caught up on the subject?
RORY: You've caught me up. Society has caught me up. The health channel on cable has caught me up. Miss Driscoll, the sad spinster gym teacher at Stars Hollow High has caught me up –
LORELAI: Miss Driscoll. Right, like she would ever need birth control.
RORY: I'm caught up. Honest.
LORELAI: Okay. Good.
RORY: Mom. What's going on with you?
LORELAI: Nothing.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI [sighs]: I might be pregnant.
RORY: Oh. [Pause] So, that's where this is coming from.
LORELAI: I blame Mom. She never sat me down for the talk. And Miss Driscoll. She had her chance too, all those PTA meetings, and all she ever talked about was golf.
RORY: How did this happen? I mean, if it's true?
LORELAI: Luke and I came home from the magazine party the other night. We were a little loopy and it got - primordial. All roadblocks down. I mean, I was always beyond careful. The last time I had my roadblocks down was, I don't know, count how old you are to the day and add nine months.
RORY: But, that doesn't mean –
LORELAI: I just ate an apple.
RORY: Uh oh.
LORELAI: Yeah, and I liked it.
RORY: Whoa.
LORELAI: My body is telling me something.
RORY: Maybe it's not telling you what you think it is. Maybe it's just telling you to better comply with the government's recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake. That's not just propaganda, you know.
LORELAI: Maybe.
RORY: And –
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Well, would it be so horrible? I mean, it's Luke. [Pause.] It is Luke?
LORELAI: Yes, it's Luke!
RORY: Well, you guys are so close, it could be headed somewhere.
LORELAI: I know, but not right now, hon. It's early for us. You know? I mean, my life is going really good, just the inn and this new potential opportunity, and, you know. I just got rid of you. It's the first time in my life I've gotten to feel like a single, grownup woman. Now is just not the right time.
RORY: Okay. Well, maybe it's not true.
LORELAI: Yeah. Maybe.
RORY: But what are you going to do if it is?
LORELAI: I could really use my magic eight ball about now. I'm going to let you go, hon.
RORY: Keep me posted.
LORELAI: Okay. Bye.
[They hang up. Lorelai watches a pregnant woman get pushed by in a wheelchair.]
STAMFORD EAGLE GAZETTE – CONFERENCE ROOM
[Rory is setting out notepads and pencils around the empty table. Mitchum enters.]
MITCHUM: I'm early?
RORY: A little.
MITCHUM: It's not ten after twelve?
RORY: Oh, your watch must be fast.
MITCHUM: My wife probably set it ahead to get me home earlier. Never works.
RORY: It's eleven forty-nine.
MITCHUM [re-sets his watch, looks around]: Charmless, isn't it?
RORY: The room?
MITCHUM: Needs plants.
RORY: I can get plants.
MITCHUM: Ever been to the Tribunals? Chicago?
RORY: No.
MITCHUM: Cathedrals. Go if you ever get the chance.
RORY: I will.
[Her cell phone rings. She ignores it.]
MITCHUM: Going to get that?
RORY: Um, I'm not done here.
MITCHUM: You've got ten minutes. [He sits.] I'm going to stay here, catch up on e-mails and make everyone really uncomfortable that I b*at them here.
RORY: Sounds good. [She answers her phone and stands outside the door.] Hey you!
LORELAI: It's a girl.
RORY: A girl? Oh good, we need a girl!
LORELAI: Why do we need a girl?
RORY: I don't know. Aren't there enough guys walking around out there?
LORELAI: Well, it's a beautiful girl, name to come, and Sookie's fine, Jackson's fine, everyone's fine.
RORY: Good.
LORELAI: Fourteen hours of labor was the downside, but Sookie has the rest of her little girl's life to get back at her for that.
RORY: I love the circle of life.
LORELAI: And there's more good news.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: It was a false alarm. I'm not pregnant. The crisis has passed.
RORY: Oh, Mom. Good. I'm glad.
LORELAI: You're glad? Huh. As the sight of babies isn't freaking me out anymore, I can enjoy the maternity ward again.
RORY: So what was with the apple?
LORELAI: I don't know. But I just had a Moonpie and a Ding-Dong and washed it down with an Orange Crush in the cafeteria, so no desire for anything nutritional.
RORY: Oh, thank God. I'm glad, Mom.
LORELAI: Yeah. So, listen. How about we reschedule Sookie's baby shower?
RORY: How? It's too late.
LORELAI: No. We'll throw a ‘Welcome to the Earth, Baby Girl Belleville' party. Did you save the decorations?
RORY: Still in my car.
LORELAI: How about Saturday morning? That's when she gets home. Just come back with me tonight after dinner, we'll set it up at her house.
RORY: Sounds good. Hey, um, did you ever mention this pregnancy scare to Luke?
LORELAI: My God, no. Can you imagine? ‘Uh, Luke, you're going to be a daddy.' Suddenly there's nothing left but a puff of smoke and a baseball cap spinning on the floor.
RORY: Yeah. He never seemed much like a family guy. This is for the best. Listen, um, I've got to get back. We have a big staff meeting in a few minutes and I want to get back and make sure everything's set up and ready.
LORELAI: I'll see you tonight, my one and only offspring.
RORY: Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
[They hang up. Lorelai watches another woman in a wheelchair being pushed along. She smiles and calls out to her husband.]
LORELAI: Congratulations!
MAN: Thanks.
HOSPITAL –SOOKIE'S ROOM
[Jackson picks up the baby and walks over to Sookie in the bed.]
JACKSON: She's sound asleep.
SOOKIE: I'm not so bright-eyed myself.
JACKSON: Hey, before you go to sleep, we should probably decide on a name.
SOOKIE: I know. Names are so hard.
JACKSON: But the good thing, whatever names we don't use now, we just use on the next one.
SOOKIE: Yeah. You know, we need to talk about that.
JACKSON: Sure.
SOOKIE: I probably should have brought it up sooner, sorry.
JACKSON: No problem. What?
SOOKIE: You're getting a vasectomy.
JACKSON: What?
SOOKIE: You're getting a vasectomy.
JACKSON [laughs]: You got me. You got me. You're funny. Dark, but funny.
SOOKIE: I'm not joking, sweetie. We're cutting that tube. If it is a tube. I'm not really up on the procedure. The doctor doing it will be, though, so I'm sure he'll know.
JACKSON [stunned]: You're not kidding.
SOOKIE: I'm not kidding.
JACKSON: Sookie, come on!
SOOKIE: Jackson, we have one of each. We've kept the species going.
JACKSON: But I wanted four!
SOOKIE: And I wanted three. This is a good compromise.
JACKSON: I'm sorry. Two is not a compromise between three and four.
[A tall male nurse enters behind Jackson.]
SOOKIE: This is Reggie, he's going to take you down and have it done.
JACKSON: I'm having it done today?
SOOKIE: Yep.
JACKSON [looks at Reggie]: They sent the big nurse.
SOOKIE: Just in case.
[Another nurse takes the baby away from Jackson.]
JACKSON: Hey!
SOOKIE: You'll get her back afterwards. Now, it's just a quick outpatient procedure! You go in, lie down, close your eyes, snip snip, and you're sh**ting blanks.
JACKSON: Is this all I'm having done today, or do I need to get some glute
implants or something?
SOOKIE: It's everything, I promise. Kiss before you go. [They kiss.] Hey, I just thought of the perfect name. First name Martha, middle name Janice-Lori-Ethan-Rupert-Glenda-Carson-Daisy-Danny.
JACKSON [smiles]: You got them all in.
SOOKIE: Now go get cut.
[Jackson goes. The nurse brings Sookie the baby.]
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE – FRONT DOOR
[The doorbell rings. Emily answers it. Lorelai is holding a bag.]
LORELAI: Hi, Mom.
EMILY: Lorelai, come in, come in. I want you to meet my special guest.
LORELAI: I'm curious to meet her.
[Emily smirks and lets her in. A young man is standing in the foyer.]
LORELAI: Oh, boy. She sure looked different in her picture.
EMILY: This is Mikhail. Mikhail, my daughter Lorelai.
LORELAI [waves]: Hi.
MIKHAIL: Hello.
LORELAI: What happened to Paola?
EMILY: Oh, that annoying little stick? She drove me crazy.
LORELAI: Hm. You loved her.
EMILY: There was something wrong with her. So flighty, so skinny. She made no noise when she walked, so you couldn't hear her coming. I felt like I was being stalked by an elf.
[The maid quietly walks up beside Lorelai and takes her coat.]
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: She had the mentality of a preschooler. If she was sitting when she laughed, she would clap her feet together. Smoked like a fiend, too.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
EMILY: And she kept playing with that obnoxious magic eight ball of yours. She'd ask it the same question over and over until she got the answer she wanted. I told her that's not how it works. You're supposed to accept the first answer it gives you and that's that, but no. She kept going. I wanted to stick the little twig in the garbage disposal. So I exchanged her for Mikhail.
LORELAI: Really? You can do that, just trade her in for another human being?
EMILY: I paid for her, Lorelai, and she wasn't what I wanted.
LORELAI: All right.
EMILY: Isn't he stunning?
LORELAI: He's easy on the eyes, yes.
EMILY: You should see him stretch. Do you want Luminista to take your bag?
LORELAI: No, I'm going to keep it with me. There's something I want to show you.
EMILY: Oh, good. Shall we go in the living room? He's learning English, so keep your words short. [Slowly] Living room!
MIKHAIL [gestures for them to lead the way into the room]: Yes, please.
EMILY: What a value.
STAMFORD EAGLE GAZETTE
[The staff meeting is going on. Mitchum has his feet up on the table and Rory is watching attentively from the corner.]
SAM: How interested are Stamford residents in a city forty miles away?
LUCILLE: They're interested.
SAM: That just takes resources away from covering local events.
LUCILLE: That are less interesting than events taking place in New York City.
SAM: If they're that interesting, we should take a couple of our own calendar staffers. Freelancers are a pain in the butt.
LUCILLE: So, Franz Ferdinand comes to New York, forget freelancers, you'll go cover it?
SAM: I didn't say that. Who's he?
[The other staff laugh at him.]
HARRY: He's a band.
SAM: Watch it, Pisher.
MITCHUM: Even I knew that, Sam.
SAM: Mitchum, please. Arbitrate.
MITCHUM: And spoil the fun? No way.
SAM: It's your money.
LUCILLE: Money well spent.
LLOYD: It's not your money, Lucille.
MITCHUM: Look, keep the system as is. We don't even have office space for extra people, let alone the budget. Go to Universities. [He glances at Rory. She nods back.] Yale, wherever. Get volunteers to pick up what our staff can't cover. Those kids jump at the chance.
HARRY: I'll pick up some slack.
SAM: After you pick up my dry cleaning, right?
HARRY: I'll pick that up too.
MITCHUM: Good, Harry, don't let him push you around.
CHARLIE: Are we going to end this marathon before we get to subscriptions? Please say no.
SAM: Charlie's feeling neglected again.
MITCHUM: Where are we with our sales department, Charlie?
CHARLIE: Abundant turnover. We have to start paying more.
MITCHUM: Oh!
LUCILLE: That got the boss where it hurts.
MITCHUM: Minimum wage plus twenty percent commission?
CHARLIE: And all the stale pastry they can eat.
MITCHUM: Up it to thirty.
LLOYD: Okay, now I'm in pain.
MITCHUM: Crunch the numbers, Lloyd, and get them to me. You never go behind the back of Captain Crunch!
LLOYD [to Charlie]: We should get together Monday.
MITCHUM: Let's all resume this Monday. Go home! [They get up to leave.] Meet your kids, feed your dogs! Have a good one.
[The room empties.]
RORY: That was fun.
MITCHUM: Yeah. Yeah, that's the way those things should go. Give and take. The less I say, the better.
RORY: Can I get you anything?
MITCHUM: No, I'm about to take off, here.
RORY: Okay.
MITCHUM: So, I'm going to be pulling back here soon.
RORY: From the paper?
MITCHUM: I've done my damage. It's time for them to take it and make something of it.
RORY: Oh. Okay.
MITCHUM: I'll probably be in Monday, maybe Tuesday, then not so much, after that.
RORY: Well, I'm happy to keep going. Even without you here.
MITCHUM: You know, you and I haven't really sat down and talked about the situation, about how you're doing here, and all.
RORY: Well, you've been busy.
MITCHUM: I've meant to. Offered you the job, took you under my wing. It's part of the deal.
RORY: Great! I'd love your feedback.
MITCHUM: Go on and sit.
[They sit down, Rory with a notepad.]
MITCHUM: I've worked with a lot of young people over the years. Interns, new hires. I've got a pretty good gut sense for people's strengths and weaknesses. Whether they have that certain something to make it in journalism. It's a tough business. Lot of stress.
RORY [smiling]: Definitely.
MITCHUM: And I have to tell you. You don't got it.
[Rory is stunned.]
MITCHUM: Now, guts can be wrong. Mine's been wrong before. But not often.
RORY: I thought I was doing okay.
MITCHUM: I just don't really think that you have the drive to put yourself out there, to be honest. To get a story. To dig. I mean, just now in this meeting, I encouraged everyone to say whatever they wanted. You said nothing.
RORY: I wasn't sure if I should.
MITCHUM: Exactly. I mean, you saw Harry. He jumped right into the fire. You didn't.
RORY: But Harry's not an intern!
MITCHUM: Doesn't matter.
RORY [near tears]: I've always done what's asked of me.
MITCHUM: See, the thing is, in the real world, it's not always good enough to do just what's asked of you.
RORY: But I thought I was in a really good rhythm with everyone here.
MITCHUM: I'm not saying you're not competent. You're smart. You're terrific at anticipating needs. Actually, you'd make a great assistant.
RORY: Oh.
MITCHUM: I'm sorry. It's not my pleasure to disappoint someone like you. Especially you. What with the extenuating circumstances. But it's healthy. I don't know any other way. I don't B.S.
RORY: I should get back.
[She gets up and heads for the door. Mitchum stands up.]
MITCHUM: Hey, listen. I know this is rough, but, uh, I may have just done you a big favor.
RORY: Oh. Okay. Thanks.
[She walks out and back to her workstation. She looks extremely troubled.]
STEAM ROOM
[Kirk and Luke are standing before the town elders. Kirk is in a towel. Luke is fully dressed.]
KIRK: He had no contract. He had nothing in writing. Granted, his offer matched the fair market value of the property but it was a rigged bid situation. The house wasn't even officially listed for sale.
TAYLOR: It wasn't a rigged bid, Kirk!
ELDER #1: That's for the courts to decide.
ELDER #2: Get to the point, Kirk.
KIRK: The house should be re-listed. You should take the best offer from the person with the best chance of securing financing. That person is me.
ELDER #2: All right. Luke, what do you have to say to that?
LUKE: What the hell are we doing in a steam room?
TAYLOR: Luke, I explained to you that if you wanted to see the town elders you had to do it on their terms.
LUKE: This is ridiculous. I can't think in here.
ELDER #1: You should strip and get in a towel!
LUKE: I'm not getting in a towel.
KIRK: I think he's got body issues.
LUKE: I don't have body issues. I just don't agree with what's going on. How it's going on.
KIRK: Town elders, I don't think it's appropriate for the defendant to address you in this tone, is it?
LUKE: I'm not the defending, Kirk. This isn't a court. It's not even a room. It's a box full of hot air.
KIRK: Now he's insulting you.
LUKE: Listen. Old guys. I should get the house.
ELDER #2: Watch your manners, young man!
LUKE: I can get a loan –
KIRK: But I have deep pockets! Not now, I mean, right now I'm naked, but my pants have pockets.
LUKE: Who are you guys, anyway? What gives you the authority to make town decisions?
TAYLOR: Luke, this isn't helping.
KIRK: He's a hothead with body issues and shallow pockets.
LUKE: This isn't right. Taylor and I had an agreement.
KIRK: He needs therapy and probably pills.
[The elder in the back corner, who has kept his face hidden, speaks up.]
SUPREME ELDER: Luke should get the house.
LUKE: What?
KIRK: What?
SUPREME ELDER: It's the right thing to do. Kirk may have a better claim technically, but Luke wants it more.
KIRK: But –
SUPREME ELDER: I knew Luke's father. His grandfather. We all did. He'll care for the house because he cares so much about it. He wants it for him and Lorelai.
LUKE: For me and - [He points accusingly at Taylor] Did you –
SUPREME ELDER: We all watched Luke pine for Lorelai for nine long years. He waited for her while she went through her many relationships. He won her. Now he wants this for her. And for the others.
LUKE: Others? What others?
SUPREME ELDER: You'll bring children into the house.
KIRK: I'll bring children into the house, too! Maybe not my own.
SUPREME ELDER: It's right for Luke to have it. Kirk is young. There'll be other places for him to go. That's what I think.
ELDER #2: Well I agree.
ELDER #1: Me too. Luke should get the house.
KIRK: Rip!
LUKE: Thank you. Thank you, sir.
KIRK: Hey, Luke, it's a big yard you'll have there. A lot of lawn. I was wondering if we could talk about my rendering garden services? I have tools.
[Luke walks out of the steam room, followed by Kirk.]
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE
[Lorelai, Emily and Mikhail are in the living room.]
MIKHAIL: Sarrusta.
EMILY: Sarrusta.
MIKHAIL: Fantastic.
EMILY: And where is your town, Sarrusta?
MIKHAIL: Just outside Moscow.
EMILY: It sounds wonderful.
MIKHAIL: Our people die very young there.
EMILY: Oh. Well, that doesn't sound so good. [To Lorelai] What's in the bag?
LORELAI: Hm?
EMILY: You've been clutching that bag all night. What's in it?
MIKHAIL: She's got mystery bag.
EMILY: A mystery bag! Yes! What's in the mystery bag?
LORELAI: Oh. Well, um, this is my cover story.
EMILY: Your cover story? I thought it wasn't coming out for two weeks. Let me see that.
[She reaches out for it.]
LORELAI: Okay.
[She smiles nervously and pulls a magazine out of the bag. She passes it across to Emily.]
EMILY: Lorelai owns an inn, uh, what would you call it, maybe a dacha?
MIKHAIL: Dacha? Yes.
EMILY: This is it. [She shows him the photo on the cover.]
MIKHAIL: Ah, fantastic!
LORELAI: Thank you.
MIKHAIL: Great dacha, this dacha!
EMILY: Are there other pictures with the article?
LORELAI: Uh-huh. Go ahead and read it. We have time before dinner, right?
EMILY: We can't start dinner till Rory gets here. [To Mikhail] You're going to love my granddaughter. You'll just want to pick her up and throw her in the air. Give one to Mikhail, it's how he's learning English.
LORELAI: Got plenty to go around.
[She passes him a magazine. Emily flips hers open.]
EMILY: Oh, gorgeous!
LORELAI: Yes.
EMILY [smiles up at Lorelai]: It's a rave.
LORELAI: We got lucky.
[Lorelai watches Emily read. Emily's expression gets more serious. Lorelai jumps up.]
LORELAI: I'll be right back.
[Mikhail stands politely.]
EMILY: Where are you going?
LORELAI: Uh, I'll just, I'll be right back. Sit, Mikhail. I mean, I didn't mean that as a command. But please, have a seat. I'll just, I'm going to –
[She leaves the room. Emily and Mikhail keep reading.]
RICHARD'S STUDY
[Lorelai enters and closes the door behind her. We hear Emily's reaction to the article.]
EMILY [OS]: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Lorelai!
[Her brisk footsteps approach the door. Lorelai locks it.]
EMILY [OS]: Lorelai! Are you in there?
LORELAI: No!
[Emily jiggles the door.]
EMILY [OS]: Come out of there.
LORELAI: No.
EMILY [OS]: This is pathetic!
LORELAI: I know.
EMILY [OS]: The things you say in this!
LORELAI: I, I know.
EMILY [OS]: Calling me Pol Pot!
LORELAI: Mom, it was meant as a joke! The Pol Pot, the walking anthrax. I was just being edgy, like Chris Rock!
EMILY [OS]: Walking anthrax!
LORELAI: You haven't gotten to that part yet?
EMILY [OS]: No!
LORELAI: Well, something to look forward to!
EMILY [OS]: I'm not going to continue talking about this through the door.
LORELAI: Look, Mom, I was mad at you when I did the interview, okay? And I said things, but I didn't mean them, it just happened! And I'm not used to talking to reporters. I didn't know about the whole ‘off the record, on the record' thing. But I know now. And I'm really sorry it happened.
EMILY [OS]: I did not force Jimmy Carter out of his room at that hotel.
LORELAI: See, now that I thought was just an amusing anecdote.
EMILY [OS]: I did not get into a, quote, bitch-fight with him. He's an ex-president! It was with that insufferable Rosalyn.
LORELAI: Again, Mom, I am really, really sorry, and unless you forgive me, I, I am going to camp out in here possibly forever. Mom, I'm just – don't tell your friends about the article, so they won't read it, and the ones who do, just tell them I was misquoted and I would recommend that you stop reading the article right now, and just look at the pictures. The pictures are really pretty. [Pause, Lorelai waits for a response.] If you are applying expl*sives to the door, please tell me, so I can step away.
[Pause.]
EMILY [OS]: I'll stop reading.
LORELAI: And we won't talk about it again, ever?
EMILY [OS]: Fine. Come out.
[Lorelai cautiously opens the door.]
EMILY: Let's go back to the living room.
LORELAI: Okay, Mom.
[Mikhail puts his jacket on and walks angrily toward the front door.]
MIKHAIL: Goodbye, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Mikhail, where are you going?
MIKHAIL: I must leave!
EMILY: Leave? Why? Mikhail!
[She runs after him.]
EMILY: Mikhail!
YACHT CLUB
[Night. Rory walks down the dock. We can hear laughter from the party on the yacht. She sees Logan talking to a girl at the edge of the boat. He is happy to see Rory.]
LOGAN: Hey! You're here early!
RORY: I guess.
LOGAN: Way early. Did you skip your dinner?
RORY: Come down here, so I don't have to yell.
[Logan comes down.]
LOGAN: So there she is.
RORY: Who?
LOGAN: The boat. Calling them ‘she' is one of the most fun nautical traditions.
RORY: Right. Something sexist in that, I'm sure.
LOGAN: I'm sure. [He kisses her.] So how'd you get away?
RORY: I don't know, I just got away.
LOGAN: I'm glad.
RORY: So, who is she?
LOGAN: Who?
RORY: The girl on the boat.
LOGAN: Okay, I'm sorry, we were just calling the boat a she. I'm a little bit behind but I'm catching up. She's a friend of my sister's.
RORY: Well, I didn't mean to interrupt anything.
LOGAN: You weren't interrupting anything.
RORY: Looked like I was.
LOGAN: I've known her forever.
RORY: Well, I didn't mean to pull you away.
LOGAN: We were just talking. Me, her, and her husband. If you want, I can have them pull out pictures of their two-year-old. Ben has them in his jacket pocket.
RORY: Do you even want me here?
LOGAN: Ace, I invited you here.
RORY: Right. On Friday night, when you knew I couldn't come.
LOGAN: It's my sister's party. I didn't pick the night.
RORY: Traffic sucked getting here.
LOGAN: Sorry, but I can't do anything about the traffic either. Can we just, um –
[He points down the dock, where they can talk without anyone overhearing. They go there.]
LOGAN: What the hell is wrong with you?
RORY: Nothing. I'm just in a weird mood.
LOGAN: I'll say.
RORY: I'm sorry, I just – can we go somewhere else?
LOGAN: What?
RORY: Let's go somewhere else. I don't really feel like being around people.
LOGAN: Okay, name it.
RORY: Will your sister mind?
LOGAN: I've been here for an hour and a half, I've talked to everybody. My duty is done. Where do you want to go?
RORY: I don't know. Somewhere. Far. Out there.
LOGAN: Where?
RORY: Out to sea.
LOGAN: Out to sea.
RORY: Yeah. Let's take that fancy-pants yacht of yours for a spin.
LOGAN: Tricky, since it's about to head out with all of my sister's friends on it.
RORY: Oh. Well, don't you have another one?
LOGAN: Not here.
RORY: Well, where's the other one?
LOGAN: Far away. Let's just drive somewhere. Let's go to New York.
RORY: I don't want to drive. I want to be out there, just the two of us. Alone.
LOGAN: Well –
RORY: You know the beginning of Moby Dick, when the narrator says that when he finds himself growing grim about the mouth and wanted to knock people's hats off, he takes to the sea?
LOGAN: Yeah.
RORY: Well I feel like knocking people's hats off.
LOGAN: So I guess we got to take to the sea.
RORY [nodding, looks around]: That one looks good.
LOGAN: Yeah.
RORY: Nice and seaworthy.
LOGAN: Not ours to take.
RORY [shrugs]: That ever stopped you before?
LOGAN [smiles]: I think I've been a bad influence on you, Ace.
RORY: Let's go, Huntzberger.
LOGAN: Let's go.
[Rory grabs his hand as they run down the dock.]
ELDER GILMORE'S LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai explains to Mikhail, who is sitting, arms folded across his chest, glaring at her.]
LORELAI: See, I was mad at Mom – Mrs. Gilmore, here, at the time, and I ended up saying things I shouldn't have said, because, you see, normally, I don't make jokes about Joseph Stalin. They're inappropriate. I just said it, and just to this writer, and she printed it. I mean, she's not Joseph Stalin. And, not that there's any excuse, but there is no way I could have known that a Russian man whose entire family and their village was k*ll by Stalin would be reading this in front of me, I mean, there's just no way.
EMILY: She has this off-putting sense of humor, Mikhail. You'd know that if you spent time with her.
LORELAI: Yes, you would. You would know that.
MIKHAIL: Yes.
LORELAI: I mean, Joseph Stalin was a monster. So, please, stay. You just caught us on a bad day.
MIKHAIL: All right.
[Lorelai's cell phone rings.]
LORELAI: Um, this must be Rory. [She pulls the phone out of her bag.] Excuse me. [She gets up.] Hello?
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Hey, um, when are you getting here? I really, really want you here.
RORY: You need to come and get me.
LORELAI: Where are you?

POLICE STATION
[Lorelai walks up to the counter.]
LORELAI: Hi. Hello. Yes, I'm here to pick up my daughter.
OFFICER: Your daughter's name?
LORELAI: Rory Gilmore. Lorelai Gilmore. She goes by Rory. I don't know what you have her under.
OFFICER: Rory Gilmore.
LORELAI: Oh, that's good, because she only answers to that. Not that she won't to the other, but -
OFFICER: She'll be out in a minute.
LORELAI: Okay. Thanks. [Pause.] Sorry, when you say she'll be out, do you mean out of a cell?
OFFICER: Yep.
LORELAI: So she was in a cell.
OFFICER: That's where we usually put people when they're arrested.
LORELAI: Was she in the cell alone?
OFFICER: It was a slow night. She had the place to herself.
LORELAI [relieved]: Oh, that's good. I mean, not that she's a snob. She can get along with anyone, it's just, it was her first time in a cell, so I didn't want her to be attacked, you know, like in Caged Heat? Or was it Switchblade Sisters? Anyway. I mean, my daughter never gets into trouble. Except, you know, now. But on the whole, the kid is an angel. She goes to Yale.
OFFICER: She'll be out in a minute.
LORELAI: Right. [She looks around.] I'm sorry. Are you, like, solving something?
OFFICER: What can I do for you?
LORELAI: I was just wondering. Is Rory in the system now? Because I just remember when Sipowicz's son accidentally got arrested because he looked like a drug dealer. Sipowicz was freaked out that the son was going to wind up in the system. And I just wonder, you know, should I be freaked out? And also, what exactly is the system?
OFFICER: She's got to go to court. They'll figure out what's going to happen.
LORELAI: And am I going to have to pay anything? I mean, bail? Does she need bail?
OFFICER: They're releasing her on a P.T.A. A promise to appear.
LORELAI: Oh, she will. She will appear. She might be there before you will.
OFFICER [losing patience]: I won't be there.
LORELAI: Right. But she will, 'cause she promised. I'll be over there.
[She walks over to sit on the other side of the room. Finn and Colin enter the station, chatting with each other.]
FINN: Well. This is much nicer than the last place we picked him up from.
COLIN: Yes, we definitely need to keep this one in mind for future infractions. Excuse me, Officer, we were wondering if one Logan Huntzberger has been released from your fine custody yet?
OFFICER: Nope. Have a seat.
COLIN: We'll be over here.
FINN: And if you have a moment we'd like to order some appetizers.
[The officer stares at him. He turns around. He and Colin sit near Lorelai, who listens to their conversation with a worried look on her face.]
FINN: So typical. Logan would have to get busted during the one time I almost got Rosemary to agree to go home with me.
COLIN: It's vintage Huntzberger, my friend. Friday nights end in jail.
FINN: The boy knows how to party.
COLIN: Stealing Richardson's boat. Genius.
FINN: Let's not forget the lovely Rory.
COLIN: Yes. Maxwell Smart finally found his Ninety-Nine.
OFFICER: Rory Gilmore is coming out now.
LORELAI: Oh, thank you.
COLIN: You're here for Rory?
LORELAI: Yeah.
FINN: Oh, well, we would have taken her home.
COLIN: Just so you know she was covered.
LORELAI [sarcastic]: Wow. The relief.
COLIN: I'm Colin. This is Finn. And you are?
LORELAI: Her mother.
FINN: My God, those are good genes.
[The door buzzes and Rory comes out. Lorelai gets up. They look at each other for a minute.]
LORELAI: You've got everything?
[Rory holds up her envelope of personal effects.]
LORELAI: Let's go.
[Rory follows her to the door. She glances at Colin and Finn in the corner. They kneel and worship her. She shakes her head at them. Once Lorelai and Rory are gone, they burst out laughing.]
OPENING CREDITS
STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE
[Volunteers are setting up flags and outhouses in the Square. Lorelai's Jeep pulls up in front of Doose's market. Lorelai and Rory sit awkwardly for a moment.]
LORELAI: What's on your hands?
RORY: Fingerprints.
LORELAI: Right. [Pause.] Do you want to go in and eat, or take it home?
RORY: Home.
LORELAI: Okay. [Pause.] We're having a bike race. Bike race through town, first one ever. Taylor's really excited. Maybe Sheryl Crow will come.
RORY: Maybe.
LORELAI: Probably not. [Pause.] I'm running out of small talk, kid. Got to get around to the main event here soon.
RORY [sighs]: I know.
LORELAI: Rory, what happened?
[Rory's cell phone rings. She takes it out.]
LORELAI: No, don't answer it.
RORY: It's Logan.
LORELAI: Rory, don't answer it.
RORY: I have to.
LORELAI: Well, I don't want you talking to him right now.
RORY: Why not?
LORELAI: Why not? He just got you arrested.
RORY: He did not.
LORELAI: Don't protect him.
RORY: It was my idea!
LORELAI: Oh, come on.
RORY: Logan was at his sister's engagement party having a perfectly lovely time when I showed up and dragged him off. He spent the night in jail because of me. I have to take this call. [She flips open the phone.] Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. I was just worried about you.
[Lorelai, angry, gets out of the car and slams the door. Rory looks after her. Lorelai walks down the street towards Luke's. Taylor jogs up behind her.]
TAYLOR: Lorelai. Yoo-hoo! Behind you! Back here! Turn around! Turn around, turn around!
[Lorelai, frustrated, turns around.]
LORELAI: Yes, Taylor.
TAYLOR [gasping for breath]: You know we have a race coming through here tomorrow.
LORELAI: Uh, yeah, it says it on the banners.
TAYLOR: The fifth annual Connecticut Bike Race. It's a very prestigious race.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure.
TAYLOR: Now, I don't know if you've noticed the no parking signs I've been putting out.
LORELAI: I didn't, Taylor.
TAYLOR: I swear, if something doesn't have a Marc Jacobs label on it, you girls just don't notice it. Well, I have just put no parking signs all up and down the street here, in hopes of clearing a safe and unobstructed path through Stars Hollow.
LORELAI: Well, what a super goal, Taylor.
TAYLOR: Thank you. Now, if you notice, your Jeep is currently parked in what is about to become a no parking zone.
LORELAI: Really.
TAYLOR: As of ten o'clock tonight. At 10:01, we will be towing. [He points to Kirk in a tow truck.]
KIRK: I'm coming for you!
LORELAI: Okay, Taylor, it's nine fifty-five. I still have six minutes.
TAYLOR: Yes, but it would be easier if you would just move the car now.
LORELAI: If it's easy then anyone could do it, and I'm a maverick.
[She turns and keeps walking. Taylor looks to heaven.]
TAYLOR: Look what Jane Fonda hath wrought.
[He checks his watch.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is wiping counters. Lorelai enters.]
LORELAI: Rory stole a yacht. How's your night been?
LUKE [turns around]: What? What do you mean, Rory stole a yacht?
[They sit down.]
LORELAI: I, uh, just got back from picking Rory up from the Bridgeport police department where she was brought following her arrest for grand theft boating.
LUKE: Tell me what happened.
LORELAI: I don't know what happened. I haven't gotten the details yet. I did get a piece of paper with a court date on it, though. June third. Sounds like a good day to go to court, don't you think?
LUKE: Was she with that Logan kid?
LORELAI: Yes, he was arrested too.
LUKE: Well, there you go. He got her into this.
LORELAI: That's what I said. I need hand soap.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Oh, she got ink all over her hands from the fingerprinting and I'm out of soap.
LUKE: I have soap.
LORELAI: Maybe she needs special soap. Is there special soap? Is it special ink? It must be special ink, right?
LUKE: I don't –
LORELAI: I mean, of course. [She gets up and walks behind the counter.] They're not going to use normal ink for fingerprinting, it's supposed to brand you and humiliate you. Normal ink wouldn't humiliate you, unless you're Rory and your mother has no soap.
LUKE: What are you doing?
LORELAI: I should make a list. I'm going to forget things. I just need a pen. [She grabs a notepad from beside the register.]
LUKE: Here.
LORELAI: Okay, so, okay. Buy soap. Let's see, what else? Buy soap, buy soap, uh, get lawyer –
LUKE: I can help you with a lawyer.
LORELAI: Oh, crap, Rory's car! It must still be at the marina. She's going to have to pick it up. If it hasn't been impounded! How do I find out if it's been impounded?
LUKE: I'm sure you can call down there, and –
LORELAI: God, every ten seconds something else pops into my head. I'm just not prepared for this. I mean, Rory never even shoplifted. Not a candy bar, not a lipstick. She forgot to return a library book once. And she was so guilty about it that she grounded herself. I mean, can you imagine? She's just sitting there in her bedroom yelling at me, "Now no one else got to read the Iliad this week because of me!"
LUKE: What can I do?
LORELAI: Rory hasn't eaten.
LUKE: I can make you some burgers.
LORELAI: No, no, no. Just donuts. We need to get home and get to the bottom of this. [She takes a deep breath as Luke gets the donuts ready.] Okay. This is not the end of the world, right? I mean, Rory's young. Young people do stupid things. I got pregnant. This is better, it's not so permanent. Unless it's on her permanent record, and then, oh, God, does that mean she can't vote?
LUKE: Oh, I don't think –
LORELAI: I thought I read that if you commit a felony you can't vote.
LUKE: I think that's –
LORELAI: Rory loves to vote! She switched her ‘I voted' sticker from outfit to outfit this year, and then she scotch taped it to her purse! She has to be able to vote!
LUKE: You want me to come with you when you talk to her?
LORELAI [distant]: No. Thanks, she's in the car. I should go. Thanks for the donuts.
[She grabs the bag and walks out.]
LUKE: Yeah. Sure.
LORELAI'S JEEP
[Lorelai gets back in. Rory is off the phone.]
RORY: Kirk just came by and gave us a two minute warning. Any idea what he's talking about?
LORELAI: Who ever has any idea what Kirk's talking about? Here. [She hands her the bag of donuts.]
RORY: Thanks.
LORELAI [sighs]: Rory, what happened tonight?
RORY [after a pause]: I stole a yacht.
LORELAI: Yes, I know. The nice men with the g*n told me. Why?
RORY: I just – I was really upset and I felt like I had to do something.
LORELAI: Okay, sure, I get that. But when I'm upset and I need to do something I eat a lot of pound cake. They don't have pound cake at Yale?
RORY: No, they have pound cake at Yale. [She sighs. Lorelai looks at her expectantly.] Mitchum Huntzberger talked to me today. About my performance.
LORELAI: And?
RORY: And he said that I was very smart and competent and would someday make someone a great assistant.
LORELAI [scornful]: Uh-huh.
RORY: But as a journalist, he just doesn't think I have it.
LORELAI: It? Who is he, Louis B. Mayer?
RORY: No, he says he has like a sense for this kind of thing. I just – I don't know, it was a surprise. I mean, I thought I was doing really well. I thought I was impressing him. I thought he was going to offer me a summer job at the paper, I thought –
LORELAI: Oh, God, I hate this guy.
RORY: It's not his fault. I mean, if he doesn't think I could be a journalist, it's probably best that he tells me before –
LORELAI: Before what?
RORY: Before I go out there and fall on my face.
LORELAI: But, Rory, he is wrong He doesn't know what he's talking about.
RORY: He does this for a living.
LORELAI: Not after I k*ll him, he doesn't. Big, fancy, arrogant creep. Handing down these all-knowing proclamations. I mean, how the hell does he know if you have ‘it' or not? Has he seen your writing? Has he talked to you, I mean really talked to you? Has he talked to any of your teachers? Has he talked to anyone who knows how much ‘it' you have? No. He's spent exactly two weeks with you, ordering you around, sending you on coffee runs, playing the big sh*t!
RORY: He is the publisher!
LORELAI: I know what it says on his business card. I'm going to kick his ass.
RORY: Should we be at all concerned that Kirk's trying to tow us away right now?
LORELAI: No. He is not God! This is one man's opinion. He did not invent journalism. He's just a guy with a really good parking space.
RORY: I'm so, so sorry.
LORELAI: I know you are.
RORY: I was so stupid. I'll never be that stupid again.
LORELAI: Aw. Sure you will.
RORY: Oh my God. I got arrested. I have to go to court! I have to go get my car. No – do you have soap at home? Because I have all this ink all over my hands, and –
LORELAI: Honey. Relax. We will figure it out.
[She smiles reassuringly and squeezes Rory's wrist. Rory looks ahead nervously as they drive away, just as Kirk is about to attach the chains from the tow truck. He drops them, defeated.]
STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE
[The troubadour is singing on a corner.]
TROUBADOR [singing]: I turned twenty-one in prison, doing life without parole. No-one could steer me right, but Mama tried, Mama tried. Mama tried to raise me better but her pleading I denied, that leaves only me to blame, ‘cause Mama tried. Leaves only me to blame, ‘cause Mama tried.
LANE'S HOUSE
[Lane knocks on the bathroom door.]
LANE: Brian! I need to get in there!
BRIAN [opens the door, wearing a suit]: I was only in there fifteen minutes. I clocked it.
[Brian walks over to the bunk beds, where Zach is laying in bed.]
ZACH: Time, dude?
BRIAN: Seven thirty.
ZACH: Crap. I overslept.
BRIAN: You're saying that like it's my fault.
ZACH [getting up]: Shut up. It is your fault.
BRIAN: I told you to get a clock you don't have to wind.
ZACH: I told you to shut up.
BRIAN: You never wind it, then you yell at me.
ZACH: Dude, you keep nagging me, I'm going to have to buy you a ring.
[He turns on some music. Lane comes out of the bathroom.]
LANE: I get off work at six.
ZACH: I'll alert the media.
LANE: I mean, that's early enough to have band practice. Are we having band practice tonight?
[Zach turns on the T.V. and starts playing a video game.]
ZACH: Maybe.
BRIAN: I may have to work late.
LANE: Brian.
BRIAN: I have my temp review, Lane. I think they might be ready to offer me the full-time receptionist job.
LANE: It's been a while since we've practiced.
ZACH: We've been busy.
LANE: Tomorrow, then?
ZACH: Definitely a conversation to have.
LANE: Fine, we'll talk tonight. Have you seen my jeans jacket?
ZACH [at the T.V.]: Oh, come on! I threw the troll!
[Lane sees her jacket behind her drum set. She walks over and realizes that her drums are covered by drying clothes and empty beer bottles. She looks at Brian, reading the paper in the kitchen, and then at Zach, absorbed by his video game. She looks dejected.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – KITCHEN
[Rory comes out of her room.]
LORELAI: Morning!
RORY: God, I feel like I could sleep through the entire day.
LORELAI: Coffee will be ready soon.
RORY: What are you doing?
LORELAI: Well, I'm updating the refrigerator.
[She steps back from the fridge to display Rory's mug sh*t attached to the door.]
RORY: Where did you get that?
LORELAI: Oh, the nice lady at the police station e-mailed it to me. I thought it would look really nice next to your kindergarten handprint collage. I got you a copy if you're thinking Christmas cards.
RORY: Very thoughtful.
LORELAI: You hungry?
RORY: I'm starving. I've had nothing but donuts for two days. [Lorelai brings her some bread and water.] Funny.
LORELAI: Hold on.
[She turns on some music.]
RORY: I'm really glad you're enjoying this.
LORELAI: Rory, the penal system is not something we enjoy, It's something with a name that makes us giggle.
RORY: I assume there's pop-tarts? [She gets up.]
LORELAI: Now, what's on the agenda for today? I hear there's a shipment of plutonium coming in at the docks, and I thought we could dress up as nuns and I could distract them with a fake stigmata, you could shove the plutonium under your habit, and –
RORY: I have to got back to school. I have one last final, plus –
LORELAI: Oh, wait.
[She grabs two telephones and sets them on the table, as if they are separated by glass. She picks up one of the phones and looks up at Rory. Rory decides to play along.]
RORY: Plus I have one last load of stuff that I need to pick up and transport back here. And now I have to hang up. Visiting hours are over. [They hang up the phones.] Thanks for letting me borrow the Jeep.
LORELAI: Figured if I didn't give it to you voluntarily you'd just heist it anyway.
RORY: This bit's going to last for a while, huh?
LORELAI: Mm. Twenty to life. Time off for a well-placed Tom Sizemore Whizzenator joke.
RORY: Don't let the movies fool you, kiddies. Crime doesn't pay.
[She walks toward the door. Lorelai follows her.]
LORELAI: Listen, uh, later today I'm going to try and track us down a lawyer. I thought I'd call that guy who got Robert Blake off, what was his name, Houdini? [Rory stares at her.] What?
RORY: Where are you really going to get this lawyer?
LORELAI: The emergency room. Ambulance dispatch center?
RORY: You're not going to tell –
LORELAI: No. I'm not going to go through Mom and Dad. There's no reason they need to know about this.
RORY: Did I say I'm sorry in the last five minutes?
LORELAI: Hm. I think not slugging me when I pulled out the telephones said it for you.
RORY: I love you, mom.
LORELAI: I love you, kid.
[Rory kisses her cheek and leaves as the phone rings. Lorelai answers it.]
LORELAI: Hello.
LOGAN: Uh, hi. Is Rory there?
LORELAI: She just left, who's calling?
[Scene cuts to Logan at the Yale campus.]
LOGAN: It's Logan.
LORELAI [hesitates]: Oh. She's not here.
LOGAN: I've been trying to get her, her phone must be off or dead or something.
LORELAI: Well, she's heading back to school. You can just catch up with her there.
LOGAN: Yes, I'll do that.
LORELAI: Okay. Bye.
LOGAN: Oh, listen, I'm sorry to call your house. I just had this number and I wanted to talk to Rory.
LORELAI: It's okay, Logan.
LOGAN: And listen, I know you must be really upset by this whole thing, but I want you to know my father's lawyers are all over the situation, and –
LORELAI: Hey, you know what? I think your father has done just about enough here, okay?
LOGAN: Done enough?
LORELAI: Yes. So, thank your father for this. And I do mean all of this. But I think I can handle it from here.
LOGAN: But –
LORELAI: His help isn't needed, Logan. I've got it.
LOGAN: Okay. You got it. Sorry, I was just –
LORELAI: Rory should be back at school soon.
LOGAN: Right. Sorry to bother you.
LORELAI: No problem. Bye.
[She hangs up.]
YALE CAMPUS
[Rory walks around the corner to her dorm. Logan is sitting on the bench by her door.]
RORY: Hey.
LOGAN: What'd he do?
RORY: What?
LOGAN: My father. What'd he do?
RORY: Who told you that he did anything?
LOGAN: I called your house. I talked to your mom.
RORY: Great.
[She unlocks the door and they go inside.]
LOGAN: I should have known something happened, the way you showed up at Honor's party like that. I should have known.
RORY: My mother shouldn't have said anything.
LOGAN: She didn't say anything specific.
RORY: Then what'd she say?
LOGAN: Rory, just tell me what happened.
RORY: It's stupid. I feel stupid.
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: I overreacted. You'll think I'm three.
LOGAN: Tell me.
RORY: He just doesn't think that I've got what it takes to be a journalist. He says he knows when someone has it, and I apparently do not have it.
LOGAN: He said that to you?
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: Just like that.
RORY: Pretty much.
LOGAN: I knew it. I knew this was going to happen. I didn't want you to take that internship.
RORY: I had to take the internship. Your father's the top guy in the business.
LOGAN: My father is a jackass! He's a bully! He has zero interest in people's feelings. It's always just say what you feel, right or wrong, who the hell cares who you hurt. Whatever. I'm going over there right now.
RORY: Logan, no.
LOGAN: You're my girlfriend, Rory, he should have treated you better than that.
RORY: I don't want you to say anything!
LOGAN: I have to!
RORY: Logan, no! Please! I just want to forget this. I just want it to go away! And please don't make a big thing between you and your dad, I don't want that!
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: Don't put me in that position, please.
LOGAN [sighs]: I'm sure he'll give me a crappy present for my birthday. Maybe I can pick a fight with him over that.
RORY: Thank you.
LOGAN: You should have told me.
RORY: I didn't want to tell you.
LOGAN: Hey. If this relationship thing is going to work, then it goes both ways. You have to tell me why were committing a felony before we do it. Not that that's going to stop us, but at least I'll have all the facts, okay?
RORY: Okay. I'm sorry.
LOGAN: Come here. [He pulls her into a big hug.] You need some help packing?
RORY: No. I've got my last final today. I should go over my notes.
LOGAN: Okay. Call me after.
RORY: I will.
LOGAN: You're good?
RORY: I'm good.
LOGAN: Okay. Oh, and try and talk to your mother. My father's lawyers should really handle this thing. They've had a lot of practice, believe me.
RORY: Okay. I'll talk to her.
[He leaves.]
LUKE'S DINER
[The bikers cycle past, calling out to their followers as they round the corner.]
BIKERS: Big hole! Big hole! Big hole!
[Inside, spandex-clad bikers are everywhere. Taylor and Luke sit together at a table with a pile of papers.]
TAYLOR: You, uh, signed on the wrong line.
LUKE: Oh, sorry.
TAYLOR: Cross it out, initial it, and sign again.
BIKER [outside]: Big hole!
LUKE: What the hell is wrong with them? Why can't they just let the bozo in back of them figure out for himself there's a big hole there!
TAYLOR: You're awfully crabby for a man whose business is booming because of this race.
LUKE: I don't want this kind of business. It's too shiny.
TAYLOR: I myself am finding the whole thing rather intoxicating. Our little town, the site of an international sports event like this? You have no idea how much wrangling it took to get them here.
BIKER [outside]: Big hole!
LUKE: Ah, geez. I smudged! He made me smudge!
TAYLOR [patiently]: Cross it out, initial the smudge, then start again. [Luke sighs.] I lobbied the race coordinators for weeks. It was a lot of ouzo and karaoke, but I bagged our town the coveted first stop, last stop slot.
LUKE: Wait, first stop, last stop meaning –
TAYLOR: They start here today, circle the state, then end here later this week. Every one of them will be coming back.
BIKERS [outside]: Big hole! Big hole!
LUKE: Unbelievable.
TAYLOR: Uh, don't press too hard, there, buddy, I don't want to start all over again.
LUKE: That's the last one.
TAYLOR: Excellent. [He gathers up the papers.] Well, I guess congratulations are in order, Luke. You've just bought yourself the Twickham house.
LUKE: Thank you, Taylor.
[They get up and Taylor heads for the door.]
TAYLOR: Now, remember, there's a three day cooling-off period, meaning you have three days from today to change your mind.
LUKE: I'm not going to change my mind.
TAYLOR: Well, it's been a pleasure doing business with you, Luke! I certainly hope it works out for you and your future plans.
[He leaves.]
BIKER [outside]: Big hole!
LANE: I'm taking my break! [She sits down with the band and a plate of fries.] I have fifteen minutes.
ZACH: No chili?
LANE: Where's Gil?
ZACH: It totally needs some chili.
BRIAN: Gill called. His delivery boy didn't show so he has to make some stops on the way. He said he may not be able to make it.
LANE: Of course he can't make it. Why should he make it? I mean, it's only a band meeting, right? Nothing important.
ZACH [eating the fries]: Oh, my God, I can taste the potato!
BRIAN: So?
ZACH: So I hate the potato. The chili hides the potato.
LANE: Zach!
ZACH: Nice screech.
LANE: This right here, this attitude! It's exactly what I'm talking about.
ZACH: What do you mean, what you're talking about? You haven't said anything yet.
[Gil enters the diner, wearing his work uniform.]
LANE: I think we have a problem.
BRIAN: We do?
GIL: I just got totally boned by this sixteen year old Three Doors Down fan. My week sucks.
LANE: I started the meeting already, Gil.
GIL: Gee, sorry Lane. I dropped off the hoagies as quickly as I could. Next time I won't wait for the money, and my kid can just paint himself silver and do the robot on the street corner for tuition fees.
LANE: What's going on here? Are we breaking up?
ZACH: What? Oh, you mean the band. Okay, cool. Wow. Go on.
BRIAN: We're not breaking up. Are we breaking up?
LANE: Well, I don't know. It just seems to me that lately the band doesn't seem to be as important to everyone as it used to be.
ZACH: I don't agree.
LANE: We hardly practice anymore. Everyone else has all these other things to do. There were clothes on my drums this morning.
BRIAN: Sorry. After I Woolite that sweater I have to lay it out flat or else it loses its shape.
GIL: Lane, relax. Things have just been a little crazy lately.
BRIAN: Oh, that reminds me. I got offered that full-time receptionist job today.
ZACH [pleased]: Really?
GIL: Welcome to the grind, my friend.
BRIAN: They're giving me a raise and I get to keep the blazer.
GIL: Awesome blazer!
LANE: I'm sorry, does anyone else see what's going on here? Brian's talking about talking a full-time job.
BRIAN: So?
LANE: The band's supposed to be your full-time job!
ZACH: Lane.
LANE: No, no Lane! [To Zach] You have your Americana banjo band, [to Brian] and you have Century 21, [to Gil] and you have a really stupid hat on. And what do I have, huh? According to my mother I am going to hell for this. That's commitment, my friends! Eternal damnation is what I'm risking for my rock and roll!
ZACH: Lane, calm down. We all care about the band.
LANE: So I'm just imagining all of this?
[They all look at each other guiltily.]
LANE: I think we need to play more.
BRIAN: We've played every club around here a hundred times.
LANE: Well, then maybe we need to tour!
GIL: Tours are rough, Lane. They have to be planned. Venues must be booked, you need publicity. Transportation. Money.
LANE: Well, we have to do something.
BIKER [outside]: Big hole!
LUKE: That's it!
[Luke heads out the door with a baseball bat.]
BIKERS [outside]: Big bat! Big bat! Big bat!
DRAGONFLY INN - LOBBY
[The place is overrun by bikers. Michel walks through a crowd of them carrying a large gift basket. He looks objectionably at two bikers. One is poking the other's butt muscle.]
BIKER #1: Six hundred lunges every night.
BIKER #2: Impressive.
LORELAI [getting off the phone]: Thank you! [To Michel] We are booked, booked, booked. I now love bike riders so much, that from now on when driving I will no longer consider how many points I'd get if I took them out. What's this? [Michel sets down the gift basket.]
MICHEL: This is for you, apparently.
LORELAI: A present? I love presents! I wonder who it could be from? [She reads the card.] Lorelai, a little something to make the trip over to the Durham Group a bit more fun. Mike Armstrong. Thank you, Mike Armstrong!
MICHEL: That is the man who wants to buy the inn, no?
LORELAI: Oh, my God! Look at all this stuff! Travel soap, travel candles, a travel blanket, cashmere travel pillow, cashmere socks, oh my God. This is La Mer youth serum. Apparently you put this on before you get on a plane, and by the time you get off you're Dakota Fanning. Michel, take something! What do you want?
MICHEL: The memory of those bikers poking each other in the buttocks
‘Eternal Sunshine'd out of my mind.
LORELAI: Come on, Michel, take something. You love products.
MICHEL: You're going to do it, aren't you?
LORELAI [sniffing a candle]: Do what?
MICHEL: You're going to sell the inn to Mike Armstrong.
LORELAI: Ooh, Euros. Cool.
MICHEL: You're going to sell the inn to Mike Armstrong, and then you're going to go off and have a wonderful life and I'm going to be unemployed. A very attractive asset on the dating scene. You know, we have our own little section at Match.com.
LORELAI: Michel, stop it. I'm probably not going to take the deal.
MICHEL: You're not?
LORELAI: This is my inn. I love it here. It's just fun being wooed, you know? Having someone want you enough to send you Prescriptives misting lotion.
MICHEL: Fine. If you say so.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, did the handyman get here yet? That loose banister's making me nervous.
MICHEL: He has not come. Should I call him again?
LORELAI: No. Forget it. I'll call Luke. He'll come fix it, and all it'll cost me is my honor.
MICHEL: Hm. What a lovely arrangement you two have. [He picks a bottle out of the basket and leaves.]
YALE CLASSROOM
[Students, sitting in rows of desks, are busily writing an exam. The professor sits at the front of the class reading a book. He checks his watch.]
PROFESSOR: And the countdown continues. Twenty-five more minutes, people. Can you stand the excitement? I know I can't.
[The camera moves down the aisle to Rory, who is leaning her head in her hand and gazing out the window. Her paper is blank.]
DRAGONFLY INN – LIVING ROOM
[Luke enters with his toolbox.]
LUKE: I've only got ten minutes. What do you need?
LORELAI: Oh! The banister's loose upstairs.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: The window in room three is stuck. The barn door's off its tracks again, and ooh, hey, did you bring your jackhammer?
LUKE: Did you hear the part about I've only got ten minutes?
LORELAI: Window in room three is stuck.
LUKE: Let's go.
[They walk over to the front desk to get the key to room three.]
LORELAI: But, if you fix it really quickly, the banister is right on your way back down, so really you might as well take a look at that, too.
LUKE [referring to the gift basket]: What's all this stuff?
LORELAI: That is my big, fancy present.
LUKE: From who?
LORELAI: From Mike Armstrong.
LUKE: Who the hell is Mike Armstrong?
LORELAI: He's my other lover. He owns a diner in Woodbury. I didn't want you to find out this way, but –
LUKE [reading the card]: The Durham Group.
LORELAI: Yeah, they're the hotel chain who wants to buy the inn.
LUKE: What are they sending you gifts for?
LORELAI: Well, either they're disproportionately worried about my cuticles, or they can't live without me and they are begging me to accept their offer.
LUKE: To buy the inn.
LORELAI: Yeah. They've been after me ever since that meeting.
LUKE: What meeting?
LORELAI: The meeting with Mike Armstrong.
LUKE: I didn't know you had a meeting with Mike Armstrong.
LORELAI: Yes, you did.
LUKE: No I didn't.
LORELAI: Yes you did. You told me to have a meeting with Mike Armstrong.
LUKE: I know, but you never said anything, so I figured it went away.
LORELAI: Oh. Well, I had a meeting with Mike Armstrong.
[She heads over to the stairs. Luke follows her, mystified.]
LUKE: And?
LORELAI: And what?
LUKE: And what happened?
LORELAI: Nothing. He talked, I listened. I told him I'd think about it.
LUKE: Think about it.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: About selling the inn. And then, after you sell the inn, then what?
LORELAI: I'd be like a consultant for their company.
LUKE: Is that what you want?
LORELAI: I don't know.
LUKE: Are you going to take this job?
LORELAI: Probably not. I'm still mulling.
LUKE: Mulling! You're still mulling? She's still mulling!
LORELAI: Why are you so upset?
LUKE: I'm not upset! I just can't believe you're still mulling!
LORELAI: Luke!
LUKE: I mean, you're seriously considering selling the inn and taking this job. I mean, where's their office, anyway?
LORELAI: They've got a bunch of them. I don't know where exactly I'd be.
LUKE: Well, shouldn't you ask?
LORELAI: Hello, mulling.
LUKE: I mean, they could send you anywhere!
LORELAI: Luke!
LUKE: And then there's all that travel. There's travel, right?
LORELAI: Yes. No, I don't know. What are you freaking out about?
LUKE [hysterical]: Well, what about the kids?
LORELAI: What kids?
LUKE: Uh, nothing. Never mind, forget it. I'm going to – [He points up the stairs.] Fix the window.
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: Room three. Got it.
[Lorelai looks after him, stunned.]
KIM'S ANTIQUES
[Lane enters.]
LANE: Mama! It's me, Lane!
MRS. KIM: Over here, in the twenty percent off section.
LANE: Am I disturbing you?
MRS. KIM: No. But it is past their bedtime. [She holds up two dolls, which she is putting away in a dollhouse.] That was a joke.
LANE: You're in a good mood.
MRS. KIM: I had a good day.
LANE: Sell a lot of things?
MRS. KIM: You would like to see my receipts?
LANE: No.
MRS. KIM: My inventory reports?
LANE: No, Mama, I was just making small talk.
MRS. KIM: You would like some tea?
LANE: No, I just want to tell you something.
MRS. KIM: All right. [They sit.] Tell me something.
LANE: It looks like the band may be breaking up. We've hit a rut. We can't get enough gigs to get any momentum, and, I don't know. It's just not working.
MRS. KIM: I see.
LANE: I think I may need to move back home. I realize that if you allow me to do that, then I will have to abide by any rules you feel necessary. I also anticipate the words ‘Seventh Day Adventist college' will come up, so I'll go shopping for some Peter Pan collared shirts tomorrow.
MRS. KIM: No more band?
LANE: No more band.
MRS. KIM: You are not the daughter I raised!
LANE: What?
MRS. KIM [standing]: Kims don't give up!
[She marches away. Lane watches her.]
WESTON'S BAKERY – OUTSIDE
[Rory is waiting for Lorelai at a table. Lorelai walks up.]
LORELAI: Sorry, sorry, sorry. The inn was swamped. These bikers are like rabbits who don't eat carrots, too much sugar. [She sits down.]
RORY: Mm, sugar!
LORELAI: The fitness craze is completely lost on us.
RORY: I'm starving.
LORELAI: Me too. [She picks up a menu.] Hey, so how'd your final go?
RORY: It went well.
LORELAI: Yeah? And you finished packing?
RORY: All packed, all boxed. I just have one more trip to school and home and then I'm done.
LORELAI: Ah. It's going to be nice to have you home for a while.
RORY: I'm glad you feel that way.
LORELAI: Yeah. The place hasn't had a decent dusting since you left. [Rory rolls her eyes.] Hey, do you think today is the day we're finally going to go through all twelve layers of the twelve-layer German chocolate cake? The bikers have demonstrated the importance of challenging oneself.
[Rory is fidgeting nervously.]
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: I have to tell you something.
LORELAI: Okay. Wow, there's something about Weston's, it's always the place where we ‘talk'.
RORY: We could go somewhere else.
LORELAI: No, no, no. Tell me.
RORY [pauses, breathes deeply]: I have decided that I'm not going back to Yale next year.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, I don't think I heard you correctly
RORY: I'm not going back to Yale next year.
LORELAI: But why?
RORY: Because I'm not sure that it's the right place for me. And I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do with my life, and –
LORELAI: Since when are you not sure what you're going to do with your life?
RORY: Mom –
LORELAI: You've known what you wanted to do with your life since you were three. Be a journalist.
RORY: Maybe not.
LORELAI: Oh. This is about Mitchum Huntzberger.
RORY: No, it's not.
LORELAI: Rory, honey, I know that what he said hurt you, and that shook you up and you lost your confidence, but that was just one man's opinion.
RORY: It has nothing to do with what he said. And Mitchum Huntzberger happens to be the top newspaper guy in the country.
LORELAI: So what?
RORY: So if you're going to get one man's opinion, he's the one man you get.
LORELAI: You're not thinking. This is the man who doesn't want you to marry Logan.
RORY: That wasn't him. It was Logan's mother and his grandfather.
LORELAI: And you really think he's okay with it? I mean, his while family looks at you and sees Anna Nicole Smith, and they tell you that to your face, but he thinks you're swell and wants to pay for the honeymoon.
RORY: That's not why he said what he said.
LORELAI: He's messing with your mind. He has so many motives that have nothing to do with your abilities!
RORY: That's not true! He said I can't do it, so I can't do it!
LORELAI: Why are you so willing to believe this guy?
RORY: Logan agrees with him.
LORELAI: He said that? He told you he agrees with has father? Because if that's so, he's a fantastic boyfriend. Really, quite a catch.
RORY: No, he didn't say it. I could just tell.
LORELAI: How?
RORY: I could tell. He ranted about his father being a jerk, and speaking his mind, but he never said that he was wrong.
LORELAI: Rory, come on. What kind of logic is that?
RORY: It doesn't matter. This isn't about that. I told you. I just need some time.
LORELAI: You're making a mistake.
RORY: No, I'm not! This is normal! College kids take breaks like this all the time. You didn't go to college, so you don't understand.
LORELAI: No, I didn't go to college. I wasn't lucky enough to go to college.
RORY: Trust me, this is very normal.
LORELAI: No. You are not quitting Yale.
RORY: Yes I am!
LORELAI: You're acting incredibly immature. And I know it's because you're hurt, but you have got to get a grip! This is too important! You've been working towards Yale your whole life!
RORY: No. I was working toward Harvard my whole life.
LORELAI: Okay, fine. Then go to Harvard. That's cool.
RORY: I don't want to go to Harvard!
LORELAI: Then go to Princeton or Stamford or Columbia!
RORY: I want time off!
LORELAI: If you leave Yale now, you'll never go back. You'll lose momentum.
RORY: Momentum toward what? All I've been doing is working toward being a journalist! I'm not going to be a journalist, so what momentum am I losing exactly?
LORELAI: You don't want to be a journalist, fine! I don't care about that! But you stay in school, you take some classes, you figure out what you do want to be!
RORY: That's not what Yale is for!
LORELAI: That's what college is for!
RORY: Yale's expensive!
LORELAI: Are you paying?
RORY: I don't want to do that! I don't want to wander around a school where everyone else is focused and working toward something and I'm just floating!
LORELAI: So what's the great master plan, then, huh? You're going to move back home, live in your room, work part-time at the bookstore? Forget it. Not an option.
RORY: I'll figure it out.
LORELAI [grabs her purse]: I'm not hungry.
RORY: Look, I'm not going back. I just wanted you to know.
LORELAI: Message sent.
[She walks away. Rory leans back in her chair, miserable.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Caesar looks out the window.]
CAESAR: Luke, you were looking for Taylor?
LUKE: Yeah.
CAESAR: He's right outside.



[Taylor is standing in front of Luke's window, cheering on the bikers.]
TAYLOR: Go, Connecticut!
LUKE: I'll be back in a minute.
[He goes outside and follows Taylor across the street, not looking. Bikers fall all over the road trying to avoid him. Oblivious, he reaches Taylor on the other side.]
LUKE: Hey, Taylor?
TAYLOR: Uh, hello, Luke.
LUKE: You said I had three days, right?
TAYLOR: Three?
LUKE: For the house. Three days to back out.
TAYLOR: Well, I didn't say that, the law did.
LUKE: Fine, whoever said it, I want out.
TAYLOR: What?
LUKE: Forget the house! Forget the whole damn thing! I don't need it anymore.
TAYLOR: Why, Luke!
[Luke walks back to the diner, stepping over the fallen bikers.]
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE
[Richard and Emily have a quiet breakfast. They read the paper. Emily looks up.]
EMILY: I have a lunch with Sunny Kingsman today. And then I have to stop by the club at four. Some of the girls are having an impromptu birthday cocktail with Melly Rutkers. Though the last thing Melly needs is another excuse for a midday cocktail. [Richard continues to read silently.] I can stop by the cleaners on my way home if you want to have something pressed for your trip this weekend.
RICHARD: Uh-huh.
EMILY [realizing he's not listening]: And then after the cleaners I thought I'd run off with Marshall, the golf instructor at the club. Do you think you could manage to get your own dinner tonight?
RICHARD: That'll be fine, Emily.
[Emily rolls her eyes. The doorbell rings.]
EMILY: I wonder who that could be, first thing in the morning?
RICHARD: Perhaps it's Marshall, the golf instructor, unable to wait until after Melly's party to have you. I know I couldn't.
EMILY: You do surprise me, Richard Gilmore.
[Lorelai enters the dining room.]
LORELAI: Hey, um, I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast.
EMILY: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Uh, I need to talk to you guys about something.
RICHARD: Is everything all right?
LORELAI: Well –
EMILY: Sit down, Lorelai. Davita, bring a coffee cup for my daughter!
RICHARD: I have to call the office if this is going to take long.
LORELAI: No, Dad, it won't, I just, um. I need your help.
EMILY: Call the office, Richard.
LORELAI: No, Dad. I promise, it'll be quick. Rory's quitting Yale.
RICHARD: What? What are you talking about?
[The maid brings Lorelai a cup of coffee.]
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: What do you mean, Rory's quitting Yale? Why would you joke about something like that?
LORELAI: What makes you think I'm joking?
EMILY: Because Rory would never quit Yale! This must be one of your bits. You scare us with something horrible, like Rory's quitting college, and then after we have a heart attack, you tell us you were just kidding. You're having a sex change operation.
LORELAI: Mom. Dad. I'm not having a sex change operation.
RICHARD: I don't understand this. Rory's doing beautifully at school. Why would she want to leave?
LORELAI: Okay, look. I know you love Logan and the Huntzbergers, and you already have the wedding invitations printed and ready to go, but I have to tell you these are not good people.
RICHARD: Meaning what?
LORELAI: Logan's mother and grandfather attacked Rory at that dinner they invited her to. They told her she wasn't good enough to marry into the Huntzberger family, and she wasn't who they wanted for Logan.
EMILY: Not good enough?
LORELAI: Then Mitchum Huntzberger gave Rory that internship, theoretically to make up for that evening. He let her work for a while, he built her up, and then he clobbered her. He told her she doesn't have what it takes to be a journalist, and she needs to find something else to do with her life.
RICHARD [shocked]: What?
LORELAI: This happened on Friday night, Mom, that's why Rory wasn't at dinner. She was devastated. Then she went to find Logan at the yacht club, and the two of them stole a yacht!
RICHARD: No, stop it! Stop it, right now!
LORELAI: They were arrested and I had to pick Rory up from the Bridgeport police department.
EMILY: Oh, no.
LORELAI: Ever since she got involved with these people, things have been bad. She's up and she's down and she should be stronger than this, I know, but she's young and she's Rory and she's come so far, she's worked so hard. I just don't want her to lose this.
[Emily and Richard look at each other.]
RICHARD [pulls a notebook out of his pocket]: What do you want us to do?
LORELAI: Well, I've already told her that just coming home and bumming around Stars Hollow is not an option, and I was thinking Friday night at dinner we could triple-team her. I bet between the three of us we could knock some sense into her. But I really need the two of you to back me up on this.
EMILY: Well, of course we'll back you up! This is not happening!
RICHARD: How much trouble is she in with this yacht incident?
LORELAI: She's going to need a lawyer.
RICHARD: I'll call Charlie Newman.
EMILY: Are we sure we want to wait until Friday? Should we confront her now?
LORELAI: No, I think we should give her a chance to cool off a little, maybe some time will make her more receptive.
RICHARD: I agree with Lorelai. Give the girl some time.
EMILY: All right. Friday night it is.
LORELAI: Thank you. Just, thank you. [Richard smiles at her.] I should get going. Dad has to get to work.
EMILY: Would you like something to eat?
LORELAI: No. I just got everything I need.
[She gets up and leaves.]
ELDER GILMORE HOUSE – LATER
[Richard comes down the stairs.]
RICHARD: Davita, could you come here please?
[The maid hurries over to him.]
RICHARD: Look at these shoes and tell me, do these look like the same color to you? They're supposed to be the same color, they were bought at the same time, they've been residing in the same box. However, on closer examination, one of them seems a little faded. What do you think?
[The maid shakes nervously.]
RICHARD: What's the matter? I was just asking your opinion. Davita, stop that shaking right now. This is not a trick question. I just wanted an opinion from – oh, for heaven's sake. Go back to your work.
[She nods and leaves. The doorbell rings.]
RICHARD: So I guess I'll get that.
[He opens the door. It's Rory.]
RICHARD: Rory.
RORY: Can I come in?
RICHARD: Oh. Well, all right. Come in. I didn't expect to see you until dinner tonight.
RORY: I needed to talk to you.
RICHARD: Yes, well, your grandmother is running some errands and I was just doing some work in the house, so –
RORY: Well, I assume you've heard about everything by now.
RICHARD: Yes. Well, I believe I've heard some bits and pieces. You know, I really was in the middle of something Can this possibly wait until tonight? I'll give you my full attention, I promise.
[Rory starts to cry. Richard doesn't know what to do.]
RORY: Everything's falling apart. I messed everything up, I don't know what to do.
RICHARD: Your grandmother should be back any minute. [Rory cries.] I can have a maid make us some tea.
RORY [hugs him]: I'm so sorry, Grandpa! I'm so sorry about everything! I just, I don't know what to do. I don't.
RICHARD [hugs her back]: It's all right. Everything will be all right.
LANE'S HOUSE
[The members of the band are waiting for Lane. Gil is pacing, Brian is reading a book and Zach is playing video games.]
GIL: Where is she, dude?
ZACH: Don't know, man. I'm not a warden.
BRIAN: This is the second emergency band meeting in a week.
GIL: And time is pressing. I have a ten-pound salami sitting out in the van.
[Zach snickers.]
GIL: Do not giggle. [He gestures to his delivery uniform.] This is not nerdy. This is a job.
BRIAN: Hey, can one of you quiz me on the open house procedures?
ZACH: Level twelve, dude.
GIL: I'll do it. [He takes the book from Brian.] True or false. Simmering some apple juice and a couple of cinnamon sticks makes a pleasant aroma indicating ‘home' to prospective buyers.
BRIAN: True.
GIL: I'd add a little potpourri to the johns, too.
[Mrs. Kim bursts into the room, followed by Lane,]
ZACH: Geez!
MRS. KIM: All boys here?
ZACH: Yes.
MRS. KIM: Good.
LANE [smiling]: Guys. Guess what.
ZACH: Your mother just took ten years off my life?
LANE: We are going on tour.
BRIAN: We are?
GIL: What are you talking about?
[Mrs. Kim sits at the table and opens a thick binder.]
MRS. KIM: All of you. Gather round, please. [They look at each other, dumbfounded.] Do not stand there looking stupid! Move! [They obey.] Okay. You start at the First Lady of Our Sacred Heart on the fourth. The Church of the Open Hand on the sixth. Chapel Hill on the tenth. The big auditorium, not the Sunday school room.
ZACH: Are you sensing a pattern here?
GIL: Well, they do have kind of a horseshoe shape. It looks pretty well thought out.
ZACH: No. They're all churches.
LANE: Not churches. Theatres in churches.
MRS. KIM: I have contacts with the entire east coast's Seventh Day Adventist entertainment circuit. Dates back to my days in an all-girl Christian tambourine band.
ZACH: What?
MRS. KIM: I have you booked solid for two months. Families in each town will take you in, feed you, put you up –
GIL: I don't know. This seems a little weird.
MRS. KIM: Weird? What weird? You need to play, here's places to play. Nice places. Clean places. [She points at Gil.] Don't wear that outfit on stage.
GIL: It's my delivery outfit! Lane, tell her I don't dress like this.
MRS. KIM: I need to see your songs.
ZACH: Why?
MRS. KIM: To see if you need to make any adjustments. Lyrics must be clean.
ZACH: Okay, that's where we draw the line. We will not change our lyrics.
MRS. KIM: Oh, please. Prince made fifty-seven million take home last year. He didn't swear, and he mentioned God. Catch up. Okay, last problem. Transportation.
BRIAN: Hey, what about the van?
MRS. KIM: What van?
LANE: Gil's delivery van.
MRS. KIM: You have van?
GIL: Yeah. Right outside. Full of salami.
MRS. KIM: Let's see this van!
[She gets up and goes outside. Everyone follows her.]
ZACH: Lane! We can't go on some crazy Christian crusade tour!
LANE: It's a tour, Zach! It's a chance to play, to keep our band together. Isn't that important? Who cares where we're playing? Our music will be out there.
BRIAN: A tour would be kind of neat.
GIL: Brian, if you do a tour right, it could be way more than neat.
MRS. KIM: Gil, get over here!
GIL: Yes, ma'am!
MRS. KIM: This is your van?
[She opens the side door of the Volkswagen van.]
GIL: Yes. But it's not really big enough for a tour van.
MRS. KIM: What are you talking about? All twenty-seven girls and their tambourines would fit very nicely in here. Legs crossed, of course.
GIL: But –
MRS. KIM: Drums go there, bass goes there, guitars go there, Lane rides up front, and we get rid of the big salami. Pop the hood, I need to check the engine!
[She goes around to the back of the van.]
LANE: Okay, okay! I know. It's not perfect. It's not the Festival Express, but it could be really great. What do you say?
GIL: I think it's freaking crazy. Which also happens to be completely rock and roll. Let's do it!
LANE: Seriously?
GIL: Totally!
BRIAN: Century 21's been around for over thirty years. I'm sure they'll be here when I get back.
LANE: Zach?
ZACH: Well, geez, Dorothy, if Tinman and Lion are going to go, I guess I have to go too. [He pulls himself up like the Scarecrow.]
LANE: Yay!
GIL: Yeah!
[They group hug.]
MRS. KIM: Gil, get over here and pop the hood, now!
GIL: Yes, ma'am.
MRS. KIM: I haven't got all day.
GIL: I'm sorry.
MRS. KIM: You'll need new hoses, spark plugs, oil change.
GIL: Wait, let me write this down.
[Lane smiles. She is clearly thrilled.]
ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE – FRONT DOOR
[The maid opens the door for Lorelai. Lorelai smiles at her.]
LORELAI: Hi.
DAVITA: Can I take your coat?
LORELAI: Thank you.
[She takes the coat and scurries off.]
EMILY [OS]: Lorelai, we're in here.
LORELAI: Oh, hey! I thought I'd come a little early so we could strategize.
[She walks into the living room.]
RICHARD: Sit down, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Okay. Uh, Rory should be here pretty soon, so –
RICHARD: Your mother and I have been talking about the situation. We have discussed the matter thoroughly, and we have come to a decision. [He pauses.] Rory will be taking some time off from Yale. She will be moving into the pool house here with us. We will find her some sort of suitable job through one of our friends, and then after a suitable amount of time has passed, we will revisit the subject of her returning to school.
[Lorelai looks blankly at her parents, then gets up and walks into the dining room.]
EMILY: Where are you going?
[They get up and follow her. Lorelai stares at the table.]
LORELAI: I was sitting right here. I came in, I sat right here, and we had the conversation, right? I mean, I'm not imagining it, right?
EMILY: Lorelai –
LORELAI: I had coffee, you had grapefruit –
RICHARD: Lorelai –
LORELAI: Dad was reading the paper, he had to go, so I said I'd make it quick, and we sat here, and we talked about how we were going to stick together and convince Rory to go back to school! That did happen, right? I mean, I'm not completely whacko.
RICHARD: Yes, it did happen.
LORELAI: I mean, obviously I'm a little whacko, because I came here for help in the first place, but I'm not totally delusional!
RICHARD: There were other things to consider.
LORELAI: You said you would back me on this! You said you weren't going to let this happen!
RICHARD: Rory is young. And I'm sure, once she's had some time and some space she will change her mind. But for now, this is what she wants to do. And we need to respect that.
LORELAI: Have you talked to Rory about this? Your great plan, does she even know about it?
RICHARD: Yes! She's fine with the arrangement.
LORELAI: So you went to her. Behind my back.
RICHARD: She came to me, Lorelai. She told me what she wanted in her own words!
LORELAI: Wow, so that does work occasionally with you, huh?
EMILY: This makes sense. We don't want her to move in with Logan, do we? And since you don't want Rory to move back home to Stars Hollow it just makes sense that she move in here with us!
LORELAI: I don't under -
RICHARD: To watch her. Keep her from getting into trouble. We can get her back on track! [Lorelai walks out.] You'll understand that once you calm down and think about it rationally!
[The front door closes.]
RORY'S POOL HOUSE
[Through the window, Lorelai sadly watches Rory unpacking boxes. Rory looks up and sees her. They look at each other for a moment. Rory breaks away and goes back to unpacking. Lorelai, hurt, walks away slowly.]
STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE
[The town is still decorated for the bike race. It is night time and Taylor is waiting at the finish line.]
TAYLOR: This is unacceptable! Completely unacceptable! What time is it?
KIRK: Ten o'clock.
TAYLOR: It's not! It is not ten o'clock! Is it ten o'clock?
KIRK [hesitates]: No.
TAYLOR: They were supposed to finish the race at twelve. That's twelve noon! When the sun is out and the press are here and the people are interested in buying t-shirts. Nobody buys t-shirts at ten o'clock at night!
KIRK: Sweatshirts, maybe.
TAYLOR: Well, we're not selling sweatshirts, are we? All that planning. I finally had to send the marching band home. It was past their bedtimes! I have never met such soft, whiney six-year-olds in my entire life. If this was Dickens' day, they all would have been sold to a cobbler by now.
KIRK: I think I see someone coming.
TAYLOR: Oh, really? At ten-ten they come rolling in, huh? [Yelling at the bikers] You're late! You're late! You're all late! You, and you, and you!
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke wipes the counter. Lorelai enters.]
LORELAI [quietly]: Rory dropped out of Yale.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: She dropped out of Yale and she moved in with my parents, who I went to for help, and they stabbed me in the back. Everything we worked for. All these years. Her whole future. She was supposed to have more than me. She was supposed to have everything. That was the plan. We had a plan.
LUKE: Okay, I'm sorry. I have to jump in here. Uh, I know you think you have this thing handled, but I can help. First off, we call Yale and we tell them something like, uh, Rory had a chemical imbalance and she was mentally out of her mind when she told them she was dropping out. And then we get her out of your parents house whatever way we can. We lock her up in her room with you, because you can talk anybody into anything. And if worse comes to worst, we will drive her to school every day and we will follow her to class and camp out there to make sure she goes. I'll take morning classes, you take afternoon classes, or the other way around, if it works out better for your schedule. And I know there's a few kinks to work out, the kidnapping thing might be a little problematic but either way, she is not quitting school. This was her dream. I am not going to let this happen.
[He takes a deep breath. Lorelai is gazing at him.]
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Luke, will you marry me?
LUKE: What?
