"(OPEN in Luke's Diner)"
"LORELAI: Luke, will you marry me?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Luke will you..."
"LUKE: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Well, you don't have to answer so..."
"LUKE: Yes!"
"LORELAI: We can take a minute to..."
"LUKE: No!"
"(they look at each other happy & surprised)"
"LORELAI: So..what now?"
"LUKE: I don't know. This is new for me."
"LORELAI: We should do something official."
"LUKE: Official.."
"LORELAI: Yeah! Something to commemorate the moment. I mean we're getting married (Lorelai rises from her chair), Luke. Married..You and me...Luke-table-for-one-Danes and Lorelai-I'm-sorry-can-I-get-an-industrial-forklift-for-my-emotional-baggage-Gilmore are getting (deep breath) married. Uh?"
"(They look at each other awkwardly. After a b*at)"
"LUKE: (after a b*at) We could toast."
"LORELAI: Toast! Yes! Toast, good. What do we toast with? (Luke looks around) I mean I know you won't have champagne (Luke goes in the kitchen) but maybe some wine or bear or something?"
"LUKE: Nothing. I got nothing!"
"(Lorelai goes behind the counter and starts looking)"
"LORELAI: No, you must have something."
"LUKE: Grapefruit juice or Worcestershire sauce"
"LORELAI: Neither sounds very festive."
"LUKE: We can cut it with some festive ketchup"
"LORELAI: No, we need something sparkly! (after a b*at) Come on (she grabs his arm and starts dragging him to the door)"
"LUKE: Where are we going?"
"LORELAI: To Funkytown"
"LUKE: Hey! Wait! (they stop in front of the door)"
"LORELAI: What? Did you change your mind? Oh! How did I screw up so fast! Was the Funkytown thing too quippy, cause I thought you liked that about me but..."
"LUKE: No, the Funkytown thing was fine! I just...Are you sure you wan to celebrate now? I mean a minute ago when you came in here..."
"LORELAI: I just want to be happy right now. Okay?"
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Good! Come on!"
"LUKE: where are we going? (they exit the diner)"
"(CUT outside in front of the gazebo. Taylor is standing in front of the trophy table and Kirk is giving one of the bikers a massage)"
"KIRK: (to biker) Hey, am I doing this right?"
"BIKER1: What?"
"KIRK: Never mind."
"TAYLOR: That?s great grandpa! Take your time, I have no home life! (Taylor looks at his watch) Six hours I've been standing here waiting for this ridiculous race to end! OK! That?s it! Race is OVER! (to woman standing behind the trophy table) Maggie I want you to start breaking all this stuff down. If I don't get these tables back by midnight I pay for another day."
"MAGGIE: But we haven't given out the trophies to the winners yet!"
"TAYLOR: Who cares about giving out the trophies? There's noone here to see the winners get them except the losers, who I'm sure could give a rat's toushy if the winners get a trophy or not."
"MAGGIE: OK. So do I put them back in the bubble rap..?"
"TAYLOR: (takes trophy out of Maggie?s hand) Just give it to me! Hey who was first?"
"BIKER2: (rises hand) Here."
"TAYLOR: Congratulations (throws the trophy at him)! Who's second?"
"BIKER3: (gets up from a bench) Right here."
"TAYLOR: (throws the trophy at him also) Here! Third? (throws the trophy to a random biker)"
"RANDOM BIKER: I wasn't third?"
"TAYLOR: Rat's toushy, party of one. OK, everybody listen up. I want this square packer up and cleared out in 10 minutes! (looks over at Dosee's Market. Luke & Lorelai are standing in front of the door. Taylor yells at them) Hey we're closed! The market is closed! What is wrong with people tonight?"
"(In front of the market door)"
"LUKE: It's closed!"
"LORELAI: Huh! These small town hours! I hate small town hours! As soon as we get married we have to move."
"(Taylor walks up to them)"
"TAYLOR: Hey you two, what are you doing there?"
"LORELAI: Taylor, great! We need to get in."
"TAYLOR: We open at six tomorrow."
"LORELAI: OK, Taylor listen. You're going to be the first one to hear the big news."
"TAYLOR: Do I have to hear it now? I have so many things to do..."
"LORELAI: Luke and I are engaged. (Luke puts his arm over Lorelai's shoulder and starts rubbing her back gently)"
"TAYLOR: You are?"
"LORELAI: As of just a few minutes ago."
"TAYLOR: Well what do you know! I thought there was a better chance of all four of the b*at getting back together than you two ever coming down enough to get engaged."
"LORELAI: Oh well...Wonder of wonder, Miracle of miracles. Right? (Lorelai starts pointing to the door anxiously)"
"LUKE: Can you just open this door Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: What do you need in the store?"
"LORELAI: We need something to toast this moment with."
"TAYLOR: Something alcoholic?"
"LORELAI: Yes!"
"(Taylor starts pulling Lorelai aside)"
"TAYLOR: You know, Lorelai, if you feel you have to be drunk to be with him maybe..."
"LUKE: (frustrated) Taylor will you just open the door?"
"TAYLOR: Oh, all right. (Taylor gets his keys out unlocks the door and lets them in)"
"(CUT in the market)"
"LORELAI: Where do you keep the champagne?"
"TAYLOR: (points at an aisle) Over there. Top shelf."
"LORELAI: Where? (moves where he's pointed)"
"TAYLOR: Top shelf, top shelf!"
"LORELAI: Here?"
"TAYLOR: Well I'm out of ways of saying top shelf Lorelai."
"(they reach the shelf. Lorelai grabs a bottle of champagne)"
"LORELAI: Taylor, its 5.99!"
"TAYLOR: It's inexpensive, yes, but you'll still get a buzz!"
"LORELAI: Luke did you find anything yet?"
"LUKE: Nothing! No wine, no beer, no cooking sherry! It's like Dylan Thomas just blew through town."
"TAYLOR: I'm sorry. These bikers just wiped me out. They may look like health nuts, but they knock it back."
"LORELAI: Oh, Taylor, you have to have something!"
"TAYLOR: Lorelai I'm sorry but...ooooohhh wait a minute! I think I have a case of Zima in the back (goes to the storage room)"
"LORELAI: (very excited starts jumping up and down) Really? Luke! He's got Zima in the back! He's got Zima in the back! (Luke puts a calming had on her arm)"
"TAYLOR: Yup! (Taylor comes out from the storage room holding up a case) Babette had me stocking it for a while. I was using it for a step stool, but I'm sure it's OK."
"LORELAI: We'll take it!"
"LUKE: Let's just drive to Woodbridge. They have a liquor barn there."
"LORELAI: NO! I don't want to drive to Woodbridge. I want to celebrate now."
"LUKE: But men aren't supposed to drink Zima."
"LORELAI: Pay the man."
"TAYLOR: You can forget the tax. Consider it an engagement present. (Luke drops some cash on the case of Zima)"
"LORELAI: Thank you Taylor. (to Luke) Come on, get the Zima! (Lorelai stats to leave, Luke takes the case from Taylor, Taylor takes the cash of the box. They start moving to the door)"
"(CUT outside)"
"TAYLOR: Get those cables on the truck. Hustle, people! Hustle!"
"(Luke and Lorelai keep walking to the gazebo)"
"LUKE: where are you going?"
"LORELAI: I know the perfect toasting place."
"LUKE: Is it far?"
"LORELAI: Which one of us is not getting into the romantic spirit?"
"LUKE: The one with the case full of chick beer under his arm."
"(Some bikers are sitting around at the gazebo. Lorelai shoos them away)"
"LORELAI: Shoo! Shoo! Come on, Shoo!"
"(they are now standing on the nicely lit gazebo)"
"LORELAI: Here!"
"LUKE: Right here?"
"LORELAI: Right here!"
"LUKE: Oookay! (he puts the case down, and gets two bottles of Zima out. Hands one to Lorelai)"
"LORELAI: OK! So, Here's to us."
"LUKE: To us!"
"(they are about to cling their bottles when the lights go out, and the town square is completely dark)"
"LORELAI: TAYLOR!"
"TAYLOR: The light guys go on golden time in five minutes!"
"LUKE: Taylor turn the light back on!"
"TAYLOR: Well fine! Apparently there's an oil well in the middle of Stars Hollow that no one told me about. Turn them back on Bugsy!"
"(lights come back on)"
"LORELAI: OK! I believe we were right about...(they cling their bottles) there. (they drink. Luke puts his hand on Lorelai's waist and starts to pull her in) Really? You're gonna kiss me now? You're so incredibly predictable."
"(they kiss as the camera starts to pull back for a greater view of the gazebo)"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"(CUT to Luke's apartment, same night. Lorelai & Luke are lying in bed. Lorelai is about ready to fall asleep. Luke is sitting up, looking a bit anxious)"
"LORELAI: Was this mattress always this comfortable?"
"LUKE: I think so."
"LORELAI: It feels so much more comfortable. We should drink Zima and have sex every single night."
"LUKE: OK."
"LORELAI: OK. Goodnight."
"LUKE: Night. (Luke waits a b*at and starts in full rant mode) So I said ""What about the kids?"", I didn't mean ""What about our kids?"". I mean yes obviously ""What about *OUR* kids?"". But I didn't mean we had to have any kids, cause we don't, but we can, I just didn't want you to think that I was laying down some kind of a mandate, I mean kids it's plural so it sounds like a lot, but we can just have one kid, one's fine, or more if you want more, or we don't have to have any kids. We could just get a plant."
"LORELAI: (sleepy) What?"
"LUKE: Nothing."
"LORELAI: OK."
"LUKE: I bought a house, Twickham House. I bought it for us, I don't have it any more, I could probably get it back, but I just thought you should know that I bought it. For the kids that we don't have to have. It's a big house and we don't have to fill it up with kids, we could get furniture, you know, go shopping for a couch or get some end tables. I hate shopping for furniture. For me kids are easier."
"LORELAI: (still sleepy) I love shopping."
"LUKE: Go to sleep."
"LORELAI: OK."
"LUKE: Is this really happening?"
"LORELAI: Yes it's really happening. (Luke starts to lie down. Lorelai suddenly is awake) You bought a house without telling me?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: A house? I mean a house is huge!"
"LUKE: Yeah, I know that's why I told you."
"LORELAI: A house full of kids?"
"LUKE: And a plant! Don't forget the plant."
"LORELAI: Please don't do that, OK? I mean any other address or life changing decisions, please include me in."
"LUKE: I will! I am! I'm sorry! I won't! I will."
"LORELAI: OK."
"(they settle back in bed not facing each other)"
"LUKE: Sorry."
"LORELAI: Kids would be good."
"(they both smile)"
"(CUT to Luke's Diner, morning. Luke is serving customers. He's really pleasant)"
"LUKE: All right. Blueberry pancakes scrambled eggs"
"CUSTOMER WITH THE PANCAKES: I didn't ask for blueberry."
"LUKE: Any oxidants are on the house today. Who wants coffee? Aahh! (Luke approaches a table) Here you go Trudy (pours her coffee). Hey, top that off for you Mac? HEy what do you say? Cup'o joe Jo?"
"(Patty & Babette enter the diner)"
"BABETTE: Where the hell is he?"
"PATTY: There! He's right there!"
"BARBETTE: Get over here you!"
"PATTY: I can't believe it! (both ladies are very excited they hug Luke and he hugs them back)"
"BABETTE: You finally did it you dumb son of a bitch! You finally got in there and closed the deal!"
"PATTY: Took you long enough!"
"LUKE: All right easy you two (Luke guides them to an empty table and they sit)"
"PATTY: You know we should be very mad at you."
"LUKE: Why?"
"BABETTE: Because we had to find out from someone else that you and Lorelai are engaged."
"PATTY: East Side Tillie (patty does a spitting sound)"
"BABETTE: She was spreading it around town like she was gonna be a bride's maid or something."
"LUKE: Tillie is not going to be a bride's maid."
"BABETTE: But it's true. You are engaged, right?"
"LUKE: Right."
"BABETTE: So we want to hear the whole thing!"
"PATTY: The whole play by play."
"BARBETTE: How did't happen?"
"PATTY: How'd you do it?"
"LUKE: Do what?"
"BARBETTE: How'd you propose to Lorelai?"
"LUKE: Oh...I..well..."
"BABETTE: Did you get down on one knee?"
"PATTY: Did you take her somewhere special?"
"BABETTE: Did you hide the ring in anything?"
"PATTY: Oh! like a glass of champagne or a canoli."
"LUKE: Actually, I'm still working on the ring."
"BABETTE: OH! so the proposal was spontaneous, huh?"
"PATTY: Oh the spontaneous proposals are the best, you know."
"BABETTE: Yeah! Morey proposed to me spontaneously. (to Luke) Did I ever tell you the story?"
"LUKE: Um..No!"
"BABETTE: It was a brisk fall night, and Morey was on top (Luke reacts), no...wait, I was on top"
"LUKE: (wierded out) What?"
"BABETTE: Hold on! Stony Morrison was on top"
"LUKE: Babette!"
"BABETTE: We were playing Twister! Did I not mention that?"
"LUKE: No!"
"BABETTE: I probably should have"
"PATTY: Well enough about us, honey. Come on Luke, tell us how'd you do it?"
"LUKE: Well actually I didn't. Lorelai proposed to me."
"BARBETTE & PATTY: (clearly disappointed) Oh...!?"
"PATTY: You went modern."
"BABETTE: Well that's still OK sugar (puts a hand on his arm and starts rubbing it in comforting way). The important thing is you're getting married!"
"PATTY: (sounding very sorry for him) We're very happy for you Luke."
"BABETTE: Yes we are."
"PATTY: Yeah!"
"LUKE: Well thanks (looks a bit uncomfortable), I've got some work to do. I'll talk to you guys later."
"(Luke gets up, and Patty & Babette watch him leave)"
"PATTY: She proposed..."
"BABETTE: Yeah. Well thank God he's got a good ass."
"(CUT to outside, in front of the gazebo. Town Troubadour is singing. Lorelai walk past him and the camera follows her. She Stops and looks towards the TH)"
"(CUT to in front of the TH. A realtor is putting up an ""For Sale"" sign)"
"LORELAI: (to realtor) Hi"
"REALTOR: Oh! Hello there!"
"LORELAI: For sale again, huh?"
"REALTOR: Yes. We had an offer but the buyer backed out. (whispering) Toxic bachelor type. (back to normal volume) But we think it will move fast. It has all the original fixtures, great lighting, a ton of terrific potential."
"LORELAI: Yeah it does."
"REALTOR: You interested?"
"LORELAI: Oh..well, maybe."
"REALTOR: (gives Lorelai an advertising flier. Lorelai takes it) It would be a great house for kids."
"LORELAI: Oh..Please! Not you too."
"REALTOR: I'm sorry, What?"
"(Lorelai's phone rings)"
"LORELAI: Oh, nothing. Sorry. Thanks!"
"(the realtor waves pleasantly and Lorelai walks away to answer the phone. She checks her caller ID, picks up the phone and keeps on walking. Scene cuts between Lorelai walking in the street and Richard at the mansion)"
"LORELAI: Hello."
"RICHARD: Lorelai! Wonderful! How lucky that I caught you! Now a few things to go over. As you know Rory's court appearance is Tuesday at three. I've retained the services of Charlie Davenport as her attorney. Well you remember Charlie, Lorelai. He bought you a doll for your birthday once. Well he's coming over here tomorrow morning to discuss Rory's case. About eight thirty?"
"LORELAI: (soundind distant and stand offish) Sounds super."
"RICHARD: You know Charlie doesn't usually take small case like this. He's doing the family a great favour."
"LORELAI: (same attitude) Charlie sounds like a swell guy."
"RICHARD: (starting to get upset) He is a swell guy and a top lawyer. You must remember him?"
"LORELAI: Sure he bought me a doll for my birthday once."
"RICHARD: Well, do you have any questions?"
"LORELAI: Nope!"
"RICHARD: I have to say I thought you would have had more interest in this subject than you seem to."
"LORELAI: Really? Huh? So is there anything else?"
"RICHARD: No, there isn't anything else! I just wanted to fill you in! Will we see you tomorrow morning?"
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RICHARD: (in the verge of yelling) For the meeting with Charlie Davenport!"
"LORELAI: (a bit sarcastic) Oh!? No! It sounds like you have everything under control."
"RICHARD: (now obviously mad with her) Fine! I'll talk to you later!"
"LORELAI: Tell Charlie thanks for the doll for me!"
"(Lorelai hangs up. Richard puts the phone down clearly upset with how the conversation went)."
"(CUT to pool house. Rory is sleeping. Emily and a maid come in the room)"
"EMILY: (very brightly) Good morning! You're still sleeping? My goodness, you're young! These are the good days (Emily opens the curtains)! There is plenty of time to sleep when you've gone up a couple of dress sizes. (Rory rubs her eyes) Is it stuffy in here? (Emily opens up more curtains. Rory is about to lay back down but the maid pulls the pillows from under her head) So, let's talk about this room. (Emily picks up some painting samples)Now that you're staying here I thought we could spruce the place up. Individualize it to your taste."
"RORY: You don't have to do any..."
"EMILY: I've been dying to get my hands on this dump for ages. And now I finally have an excuse (pins up a paint sample on a door and looks at it). Huh? Well that?s insane (rips the paper off the door and throws it down. To Rory) You want Hosanna to draw you a bath?"
"RORY: No."
"EMILY: Hosanna, draw Rory a bath please. Hosanna has a pot of coffee for you in the other room. Interested?"
"(Rory nods. They walk to the main room of the pool house. The kitchen counter is filled with breakfast goodies)"
"RORY: Wow!"
"EMILY: I brought some fabric samples to flip through."
"RORY: The coffee smells amazing!"
"EMILY: There's cream in the fridge."
"RORY: When did you have time to do all this?"
"EMILY: Oh! It's amazing what you can get done before eight thirty in the morning. Now I've got some things for you. (Emily opens up a small envelope with keys and notes) Key to the pool house, key to the main house, key to the garage (holds up some keys). The security alarm code, the security alarm password, the number of the security company (Emily points the numbers on a small piece of paper). Now the code to the panic room is: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Don't write it down. And whatever you do, don't tell the maid. They tell their children and then their children grow up and rob you. Now is this all your things or is there more still at school?"
"RORY: Uh...No. I have a lot more...at mum's."
"EMILY: Oh! Well don't you worry, I'll take care of that. Did you try the danish? I bought it at an organic bakery. (Rory picks at a danish)"
"RORY: So...How'd it go last night?"
"EMILY: Hum?"
"RORY: With mum? Was she mad? I mean of course she was mad. But was it a bad mad?"
"EMILY: Well you know your mother, Rory. Everything is the end of the world. So dramatic. Ladies and Gentlemen Lorelai Barrymore. But don't you worry. She'll calm down, just give it some time."
"RICHARD (through the intercom): Hello? Is anyone there? (Rory looks surprised, Emily looks very happy) Come in please?"
"RORY: What's that?"
"EMILY: It's just the intercom. (to Richard through the intercom) Yes Richard we're here and we read you!"
"RICHARD (through the intercom): Copy that Emily. Is Rory up yet? Charlie Davenport is here for our meeting."
"EMILY: Well of course she's up, Richard. Please! Do you think she'd still be asleep at eight thirty in the morning? I have her here looking at fabric samples. We'll be done in a minute and I'll send her right in. (to Rory) We better get you in that bath."
"(they start walking back to the bedroom)"
"RORY: I didn't know there was an intercom."
"EMILY: Isn't that wonderful? We're just a push button away. Like Star Treck. (yells at the maid) Hosanna! We're coming in."
"(CUT to Richard's study they are all drinking coffee. Richard & Charlie are telling old stories laughing. Rory looks bored)"
"RICHARD: I don't think that duck stopped flying until it hit Paraguay"
"CHARLIE: If then..."
"RICHARD: And then of course we came home completely empty handed. Nothing but our whistles in our hands."
"CHARLIE: You came home empty handed. I came home with the Mittland case."
"RICHARD: Yes, that's right! On this trip we met Argus Mittland, CEO of Windermier Technologies. Paid for his 32 million dollar main estate and his wife's new lower half, with the companies pension funds."
"CHARLIE: 94 million dollars in accounting fraud."
"RICHARD: They had him red-handed. On tape, e-mails. The man was guilty as sin. Where is he now Charlie?"
"CHARLIE: Los Angeles. He just bought Ellen DeGeneres's house."
"RORY: So, you got him off?"
"RICHARD: And successfully sued for deformation of character. If you knew the number of truly guilty criminals put back on the street by this man here, you'd never believe in the criminal justice system again."
"CHARLIE: Now Richard, I just realised we've spent so much time talking about ourselves we haven't discussed Rory's case at all. She must have a million questions. Go on Rory. What would you like to know."
"RORY: Well, I guess I would just like to know, what's going to happen?"
"CHARLIE: (approvingly) Good question. Richard, that is a good question!"
"RICHARD: She's a Gilmore."
"CHARLIE: Well, Rory, the first that's going to happen is, I'm going to have a little face to face with the prosecutor that's handling your case. We'll go over things, I'll take him out for a cup of coffee.."
"RICHARD: Just don't take him duck hunting!"
"CHARLIE: (he laughs a bit) And then we will agree on a plea bargain."
"RORY: Really? No trial?"
"CHARLIE: Hell, no! Considering you're first time offender with demonstrably excellent character. Not to mention your family is standing in the community. The most you'll get is a little Community Service, ten hours give or take. Sound good?"
"RORY: Yeah, sounds very good."
"RICHARD: Embezzle a pension fund and you'll really see what he can do."
"CHARLIE: Now Richard, I'm afraid I must be going. (they all start to get up)"
"RICHARD: We appreciate you coming over like this."
"CHARLIE: Of course. It's a pleasure meeting you Rory."
"RORY: You too."
"RICHARD: I'll walk you out Charlie."
"CHARLIE: And I'll see you on Tuesday young lady."
"RORY: Thank you Mr Davenport. I swear I will never need your help again."
"CHARLIE: I'm sure you won't."
"(Rory exits)"
"CHARLIE: Charming girl"
"RICHARD: She certainly is.(they start walking out of the study)"
"(CUT to pool house same day. Rory enters it and she looks around surprised. It is now empty, but a few arm chairs with some fabric samples and notes saying ""Sit On Me"" pined on them. Rory sits on one of the chairs and looks around)"
"(CUT to pool house bedroom, night. Rory walks in. We hear a door opening)"
"PARIS: Rory?"
"RORY: In here!"
"(Rory puts on her jacket, Paris walks in)"
"PARIS: You live here?"
"RORY: Home, sweet home."
"PARIS: Aren't you worried that one night you're gonna sleepwalk right into that pool and drown?"
"RORY: I am now."
"PARIS: Stuff's in here (points at the closet)?"
"RORY: Go to town."
"PARIS: I'm meeting more of Doyle's family tonight. I've been meeting people for months. (she goes through Rory's clothes) He's got like five hundred cousins, and you know what? He's the tallest one in the family."
"RORY: Really?"
"PARIS: Yup. Family get-together is like a Lollipop guilt convention. I have to stop myself from asking how it's going at the chocolate factory."
"RORY: Good, good. Get it all out now."
"PARIS: (picks out a dress) This isn't half bad."
"RORY: There's a belt in there somewhere that matches."
"PARIS: So I have a matter to discuss with you. Doyle and I have decided to move in together."
"RORY: Hey! Congratulations!"
"PARIS: Thanks. We found a great duplex right near campus. Lots of room, separate bathrooms and it's a two bedroom. So I was thinking maybe, you'd like to move in with us?"
"RORY: Very Bob, Carol, Ted and Alice. Minus Bob."
"PARIS: Now, it wouldn't be till school started, cause it's rented till then, but I think it could be a perfect situation."
"RORY: It's a nice offer Paris, but I can't. I'm not going back to school."
"PARIS: You're pregnant."
"RORY: NO!"
"PARIS: Sick? You look pasty."
"RORY: I'm not sick."
"PARIS: Well I know your National Guard unit didn't get called up, so what's the story."
"RORY: I'm just taking some time off."
"PARIS: No! You don't take time off."
"RORY: Did you find what you need, cause I have to finish getting ready. (Rory leaves, Paris follows her)"
"(CUT to pool house main room, continuous)"
"PARIS: What happened? Something must have happened!"
"RORY: Nothing happened. People take time off. Einstein took a year off."
"PARIS: Yeah. After he discovered three laws of physics."
"RORY: (pours herself a cup of coffee) I do not have to defend my life to you. I'm a grown up! I'm independent! I'm on my own!"
"PARIS: You have no furniture."
"RORY: Well I'm redecorating. I want to individualize it, to my taste."
"PARIS: Oh! I get it. I know what this is all about."
"RORY: No you don't!"
"PARIS: Sure I do."
"RORY: Paris just take what you need and go, ok?"
"(Logan walks in the pool house)"
"LOGAN: Hey! Sorry I'm late (kisses her cheek)"
"RORY: It's ok."
"LOGAN: Paris."
"PARIS: (looks at him in a funny way, and starts to walk out. As she's passing by him) YOU! (exits)"
"LOGAN: (looks at Paris confused. To Rory) I think vacations are coming at just the right time for her."
"RORY: I'm ready. Lets go."
"LOGAN: (looking around at the pool house) Did you get robbed? (Rory makes a dismissive gesture and they exit)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner. Luke is wrestling with the cash register, Joe is sitting on a stool at the counter)"
"LUKE: Come On!"
"JOE: You should get a real cash register, Luke."
"LUKE: It's called character, Joe. It?s items like this that give a place character."
"(Kirk comes in the diner with a suitcase in hand)"
"KIRK: Good evening Luke!"
"LUKE: Sit down Kirk. I'll be right with ya."
"KIRK: I am not interested in food Luke. I'm here on business. I hear you might be in the market for a ring. Or should I be talking to Lorelai?"
"LUKE: Go away Kirk."
"KIRK: Well then it's your lucky day. (Kirk opens up the suitcase) Because I happen to be in posetion of the finest estate ring collection in Connecticut. And since you are a friend, I'm prepared to make you a great deal. Or will Lorelai be the one paying for it?"
"LUKE: No, she will not be paying for it Kirk."
"KIRK: Aaahhh! East Side Tillie called it wrong this time."
"LUKE: Look! I'll take care of finding the ring, OK? (Luke approaches Kirk's table)"
"KIRK: You sure you don't want to take a look before you toss me out?"
"LUKE: No I don't! (Luke takes a glance at the suitcase filled with rings, and starts staring)"
"KIRK: Nice, heh?"
"LUKE: (takes a closer look at the rings) Well...Yeah. They are nice (sits down). Really nice! Wow! Look at this one (picks up a ring). This is perfect! It looks like Lorelai."
"KIRK: It sure does."
"LUKE: And these are real?"
"KIRK: Yes they are."
"LUKE: I mean real diamonds, not ""They exist"" real?"
"KIRK: Diamond and platinum. I have a certificate of authenticity for every one of these babies."
"LUKE: Kirk, where did you get all these rings?"
"KIRK: I befriend really old women."
"LUKE: Excuse me?"
"KIRK: Really old women need companionship, Luke. They are really old. Most people they know are dead. So when someone comes along, and they are not dead and they'll listen to their stories and care about their dosage, they are grateful."
"LUKE: Are you serious?"
"KIRK: Serious as a heart attack. Which is how I got that ring you're holding right now. So what do you think?"
"LUKE: I think you've got some great choices here."
"KIRK: Good. Actually I have a lot of sympathy for what you're going through."
"LUKE: What are you talking about, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Well, Lorelai proposing to you like that. Stealing your thunder. It's gotta be embarrassing and a little upsetting. Now you'll never have that moment. You don't get to be the romantic one, the one to sweep her off her feet. That's gotta hurt."
"LUKE: I'm fine Kirk."
"KIRK: Well, sure! What else are you going to say? You know I've been getting pretty close to proposing to Lulu myself. And when I heard what happened to you, it really freaked me out. I mean if Lorelai can just spring it on you like that, what's to stop Lulu from springing it on me?"
"LUKE: Your creepy friendships with really old women might do the trick."
"KIRK: Well I've been avoiding her for two days. Hanging up on her really quickly when she calls. She may be mad, but there?s no way she's going to rob me of my moment."
"LUKE: Well, don't you feel sorry for me, Kirk. I'm going to have my moment."
"KIRK: But it's gone."
"LUKE: Trust me, I'll have it. Case closed. Now here (hands him the ring he was holding), I'll take this one."
"KIRK: Ah! Old widow Mason. Thought she was Frida Chalo toward the end."

"(CUT to alley. We see a sign that says ""Rich Man's Shoe Bar & Grill"". Rory and Logan are walking down the alley towards the bar)"
"RORY: So drink, dinner, movie? That's really what we're doing tonight?"
"LOGAN: I don't understand why you just won't believe me? I'm tired. I just want a mellow evening with my girlfriend."
"RORY: Last time you were mellow you had a 104 fever. And even then we went bar hoping for an hour before you fainted."
"LOGAN: Men do not faint. Men pass out. Drink, dinner, movie. That?s it."
"RORY: Fine"
"(Logan kisses her and leads her to the bar door. The door opens and the bar is filed with people dressed like the Daltons when in prison. They start singing ""For she's a jolly good felon"". Logan conducts them a bit. Gives Rory a hug and a kiss. Rory seems happy with the surprise)"
"LOGAN: After the party that is"
"(Juliet puts one of the felon caps on Rory and Finn gives her a hug and a kiss)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, living room, same night. Luke is sitting on an armchair looking bored and flipping through a magazine)"
"LUKE: (exasperated) How much longer?"
"LORELAI (OS from upstairs): Oh..Sorry! There is a purse-shoe incident that threatened the entire outcome of the ensemble. It's technical. You wouldn't understand."
"LUKE: I don't want to understand. I want to leave. I'm starving."
"LORELAI (OS from upstairs): Watch TV."
"LUKE: How is that a response to I'm starving?"
"(someone knocks on the door)"
"LORELAI (OS from upstairs): Heeeyy! Why don?t you answer the door? That will be fun for ya!"
"LUKE: I'm not bored because I'm six. I'm bored because you told me to pick you up at seven and it's eight thirty!"
"(Luke walks to the door and opens it. Paris is there)"
"PARIS: Who are you?"
"LUKE: Well, I..."
"(Paris cuts him off and barges in)"
"PARIS: I need to talk to Lorelai. Where is she?"
"LUKE: Well she's..."
"PARIS: Lorelai? Where are you?"
"LORELAI (OS from upstairs): Who's that?"
"PARIS: It's Paris, and I need to talk you right now! (to Luke) Who are you?"
"LUKE: Well I tried to tell you..."
"(Lorelai comes down the stairs)"
"LORELAI: Paris! Hey, what are you doing here?"
"PARIS: Are you busy? Is this a bad time?"
"LORELAI: No we're just getting ready to go out. It's fine. Have you met Luke?"
"PARIS: No."
"LUKE: I'm Luke."
"PARIS: Paris."
"LUKE: Nice to..."
"(Paris diverts her attention from Luke and turns to Lorelai)"
"PARIS: Rory's quitting Yale! I just went to see her and she told me she's quitting Yale. Did you know about this?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I did."
"PARIS: It's Logan. That Christopher Atkins wannabe is the reason that she's suddenly Blue Laggooning it right out of school."
"LORELAI: Paris..."
"PARIS: I don't understand? Why are you letting her do it?"
"LORELAI: I have no choice."
"PARIS: Yes, you do. You can stop her. You can pull some of that Super Mum crap that you always do and get her to change her mind."
"LUKE: Yup!"
"PARIS: Rory can't quit Yale! We have to do something."
"LUKE: I agree."
"PARIS: I mean we should kidnap her. Drag her back here and tie her up, and not let her loose until she oblistens to reason."
"LUKE: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Luke!"
"LUKE: Hey, my suggestion first."
"PARIS: I need her to be at Yale. (Paris & Lorelai sit on the couch) Rory has been my only real competition since she showed up at Chilton. She's the only one who?s ever challenged me. She's my pace car. She's my Bjorn Borg. Without her I'll get lazy. I'll fall apart. I'll have frosted hair and dragon lady nails, I'll achieve nothing. I'll become my mother."
"LORELAI: Paris, listen to me. You are a very smart, driven young lady. You can be anything you want. Except a diplomat. You don't need Rory to push you."
"PARIS: Rory is my only friend. She stays in the room until I'm completely done saying something. I need that."
"LORELAI: Listen. I know I'm not Rory, but if you need to talk to someone you can always call me."
"PARIS: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah! I mean I'll give you my cell phone number. It's basically my lifeline. You take it and you use it."
"PARIS: I can really call you?"
"LORELAI: Anytime, anywhere! (writes the number down and give it to Paris)"
"PARIS: I'm going to hold you to that."
"LORELAI: It's not a threat sweetie. It?s somebody who makes the offer willingly."
"PARIS: OK! Thanks! Sorry to bother you. (walks to the door) Bye Luke. (exits)"
"LUKE: Nice to...(Paris is already gone)"
"LORELAI: And that concludes the floorshow portion of the evening. I'll get my purse and we'll go."
"(CUT to kitchen. Lorelai walks in Luke follows)"
"LUKE: So what are you gonna do?"
"LORELAI: About what?"
"LUKE: You know about what."
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"LUKE: Come on!"
"LORELAI: Come on, let?s just go!"
"LUKE: no, we haven't talked about this."
"LORELAI: Because there's nothing to talk about."
"LUKE: Yes there is."
"LORELAI: Luke, this is Rory's decision, OK. She knew exactly how I felt about the situation and she chose to ignore me, she chose to move in with my parents, she chose not to tell me about it..."
"LUKE: She's a kid."
"LORELAI: She's not a kid. She's twenty. She's going to be twenty-one in October. She's been living on her own for two years now. She?s not a kid."
"LUKE: OK fine. But she's young."
"LORELAI: And young people have to be allowed to make mistakes. I much a bigger mistake than this when I was much younger."
"LUKE: Oh, so what!? Just because you made it on your own Rory has to also?"
"LORELAI: That's not my point."
"LUKE: Then what is your point?"
"LORELAI: My point is, that I wouldn't have listened to anyone in that situation, even if there was someone to listen to. I had to go through that. And Rory has to go through this. Now she's smart and she's strong and hopefully she'll figure it out but I'm not going to force my way in. She wants to be on her own? Fine she's on her own."
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Tough love baby."
"LUKE: So, that's it?"
"LORELAI: That's it."
"LUKE: And you are OK with this?"
"LORELAI: I'm totally OK with this. Come on let's go. I thought you were starving."
"(they walk towards the door)"
"LUKE: Did you give Paris your really cell number?"
"(CUT to the bar. Rory, Logan, Finn, Colin, Rosemary & Juliet are sitting at the bar drinking beer. They're sharing stories. Logan doesn't look very amused)"
"FINN: My best sloth year I believe was sophomore year. I went to Spain for a week to immerse myself in Cervantes, wound up staying for two months and almost join the French foreign legion."
"RORY: But you were in Spain!"
"FINN: Yes! But Sinatra didn't sing about the Spanish foreign legion."
"JULIET: Could you pass me three peanuts (Rory gives her the peanuts)?"
"COLIN: Two months is nothing!"
"FINN: OH! So you think you can outdo me?"
"COLIN: Freshman year, four and a half months cross country road trip. This was pre-navigational systems people."
"FINN: Junior year. I dropped my things off at my dorm room, jumped on a plane to Australia and surfed until Christmas."
"COLIN: You did not!"
"FINN: I did!"
"COLIN: Where was I?"
"FINN: In class like a good little boy."
"ROSEMARY: Amazing! They're actually having a loser off!"
"COLIN: Oh, look how she mocks! The girls stayed home for a month after she had a tragic haircut."
"ROSEMARY: It wasn't a tragic haircut! It was apocalyptic highlights. I looked like a Tim Burton character!"
"JULIET: Two more peanuts. Little ones."
"COLIN: Hey, Logan! Do you remember that time that you left the classroom to make an entrance for that mock debate, and you ended up in Atlantic City?"
"LOGAN: Vaguely!"
"FINN: Now this man here, my darling, is long raining King Of the Sloths!"
"COLIN: That's right. Noone can waste time like this man here."
"RORY: Really?"
"LOGAN: No! Now who wants to drink?"
"COLIN: Oh! He's just being modest! Logan has the talent for doing nothing, yet to be matched by man or actual sloth."
"JULIET: OK! I feel a lipstick crisis coming on. (Gets off her stool) I'll be right back!"
"ROSEMARY: I'll go with you."
"RORY: (to Logan) King Of the Sloths, huh? I don't know? This year I might give you a run for your money."
"COLIN: Oh, really?"
"RORY: Yes! All kings must be dethroned eventually. And this year that crown will be mine."
"COLIN: All hail Rory Gilmore future Queen Of the Sloths!"
"FINN: All hail! All right, time to make the rounds. See which one of these lovely females is soused enough to find my arrogance charming."
"RORY: Finn. Have you ever thought about just wooing a woman? Flowers, chocolates a little slow jam in the backround?"
"FINN: Slow jams are for the subtle Rory. One too many has a delightful immediacy. You coming Colin?"
"COLIN: Absolutely!"
"(the boys leave)"
"RORY: I wonder how beer tastes with ice cream in it."
"LOGAN: I give you one month."
"RORY: To do what?"
"LOGAN: Before you are back in school. One month."
"RORY: You are wrong!"
"LOGAN: Nope!"
"RORY: (mock disappointment) I cannot believe how little faith you have in me! I mean what kind of match would I be for you, if I just went running right back to a life of respectability, without even attempting to join the French foreign legion."
"LOGAN: You love school."
"RORY: Not anymore!"
"LOGAN: NO! You love school! I saw it! That doesn't just go away!"
"RORY: Well I have reformed! All right? From now on no more scheduling, no more planning I am just going to spend my days making ice cream-beer floats and just taking life as it come. You'll see! New me."
"LOGAN: If you say so."
"RORY: I do say so!"
"(she kisses him. Rosemary & Juliet are back)"
"JULIET: (to Rory) Come on, come on! I love this song!"
"ROSEMARY: We need to dance the booze off and sober up a little or else one of us (points to her chest) is going home with Finn."
"RORY: (to Logan) This is for a good cause."
"LOGAN: Take her!"
"RORY: OK! Save my seat. And order me a scoop of vanilla"
"(the girls go to the dance floor and start dancing and leave Logan at the bar)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn, morning. Michel is sitting behind the from desk and looks irated. A biker is flipping through a magazine, leaning on the front desk. He appears to be very sweaty and very cheery)"
"BIKER: (to Michel) You have a really nice place here. Really! I slept incredible last night. I woke up to birds singing. Seriously! This town is so great. I just had to take one last early morning ride around the town before I checked out. I can't wait to tell people about this place!"
"MICHEL: Could you move your arm please?"
"BIKER: Huh?"
"MICHEL: Your arm. That one."
"BIKER: OK!"
"(the biker removes his arm. Michel get a spray and a cloth out and starts to clean the desk, in front of the biker. Lorelai approaches)"
"LORELAI: (to biker) Hi! (starts to drag him away from the desk area by taking his bill out of his hands) So how is your bill looking? Everything OK?"
"BIKER: Yeah, my bill's fine."
"LORELAI: OK, well I'll put this in an envelope for you and I'll be right back. It's been a pleasure having you stay with us. (the biker leans against the wall and Lorelai walks back to Michel) Hand me an envelope and don't do that again."
"MICHEL: He's sweating all over the desk."
"LORELAI: Plus he's paying a six hundred dollar hotel bill."
"MICHEL: I don't care! He smells. They all smell. The whole Inn smells like sweat socks and damped nylon shorts. It's making me sick. I have to work at that desk. And I have no intention of catching jock itch on my forearm because Mr Breaking Away over there can't shower before he invades my den space."
"LORELAI: Michel, just chill out with the spray. OK?"
"MICHEL: Fine!"
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"MICHEL: By the way your mother called a few minutes ago. She says she wants to pick up the rest of Rory's things and she will be at your house at eleven."
"LORELAI: Fine. (the biker is about to sit on the little sofa on the den area. Lorelai stoops him just in time) Hey! Oh! There's your bill there (hands him the envelope)! So everything all set with your bags?"
"BIKER: Yeah!"
"LORELAI: Good! Well thank you for staying at the Dragonfly we hope to see you soon and the carts outside to take you to your car."
"BIKER: OK, Thanks! (Puts the magazine down at a table in the den area)"
"LORELAI: Thank you! (the biker leaves. Lorelai looks at the magazine he put down, gets a trash can from near by and throws the magazine in the garbage with her foot). Michel!"
"MICHEL: I'm all over it! (Michel approaches the wall the biker was leaning on with the spray and the cloth and starts cleaning)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house. Emily is walking up the stairs to the door. She knocks. Michel opens the door)"
"MICHEL: Hello. Won?t you come in."
"EMILY: (a bit shocked) All right. Thank you. (they walk to the living room) What are you doing here?"
"MICHEL: I was sent to open the door like a servant. (he sits on the couch and starts reading a magazine)"
"EMILY: What? Where is Lorelai?"
"MICHEL: I don't know. She doesn't keep the help informed."
"EMILY: She's not here?"
"MICHEL: Nope. I am here. I am here and not at the Dragonfly Inn, which I theoretically run, when I'm not busy answering doors like Benson."
"EMILY: I don't understand. You gave her my message?"
"MICHEL: I gave her your message and she told me to come over here and let you in. Like I'm a puppy fetching slippers and giving my puff for a liver treat."
"EMILY: But...I don't...Did she leave anything for me?"
"MICHEL: She left me."
"EMILY: (confused) But...I just...I can't...Well this is absolutely incredible! Does she think this is a funny thing to do? (starts walking to Rory's room) I drive all the way from Hartford. (CUT to Rory's room. Emily walks in, the place is a mess) She did nothing! Nothing is packed! Nothing is ready to go! (Emily exits the room. CUT back to living room) Where are Rory's good clothes?"
"MICHEL: I don't know. But I will continue to search for them franticly."
"EMILY: Are you just going to sit there?"
"MICHEL: I was instructed to stay until you leave."
"EMILY: Like a need to be watched. Like I'm a meth-head stealing a television set to support my habit. Well this is completely unacceptable. RORY NEEDS SOMETHING TO WEAR TO COURT!"
"MICHEL: I'm sorry if you're talking to me you have to do it in woofs."
"EMILY: You've been working with my daughter way to long."
"MICHEL: Dooon't I know it!"
"(CUT to courtroom. Emily is fussing over Rory's outfit. Richard & Charlie are chatting)"
"CHARLIE: Well, I have to say this is a charming little courtroom. Reminds me of my early days practising law."
"RICHARD: It is quaint. (the men laugh a bit)"
"EMILY: I hope we picked out the right outfit here. It's coming off a little more Mennonite than I had hoped."
"RICHARD: The girl looks fine Emily. Leave her alone."
"CHARLIE: (to Rory) Are you nervous."
"RORY: NO."
"CHARLIE: And you shouldn't be. Everything will be fine. It will be over before you know it."
"POLICE OFFICER: Court calls the state versus Lorelai Gilmore."
"(Richard & Emily leave and sit it the back Rory and Charlie sit on the defendant?s table)"
"CHARLIE: (to Rory) Who is Lorelai Gilmore?"
"RORY: I am. That's my real name."
"CHARLIE: Good thing I found out about that now. It could have been a little embarrassing latter."
"EMILY: (whispering) Rory! Rory! Unbutton the sweater a little."
"RICHARD: Emily, stop it."
"EMILY: I don't want it to look like she's trying to hard."
"JUDGE: I understand that a plea agreement has been reached."
"PROSECUTOR: That's correct your honour."
"JUDGE: Miss Gilmore please stand. (Rory and Charlie stand up) You understand that you're pleading guilty to criminal mischief in the 3rd degree in violation of section 117A of the penal code? (Rory looks around in the courtroom in search of someone)"
"CHARLIE: Yes your honour."
"JUDGE: You further understand that by so doing you wave your right to a trial via jury of your piers?"
"RORY: I do."
"JUDGE: I see that Community Service is recommended."
"PROSECUTOR: Miss Gilmore has no prior record, your honour. No history of getting into trouble."
"JUDGE: (with disbelief) Twenty hours of Community Service?"
"CHARLIE: this was a youthful indiscretion your honour. A one time childish lark. My client is duly remorseful, and I can assure you it will never happen again. (Richard & Charlie looked pleased with each other)"
"JUDGE: (to Rory) I see you're a student at Yale."
"RORY: Yes your honour."
"JUDGE: That's a very nice school. Prestigious."
"RORY: Yes your honour."
"JUDGE: I understand that the defence is portraying this as a childish lark. A youthful indiscretion. Well I take the law very seriously. And if there is one thing I have very little tolerance for, it's rich, privileged children viewing the world as their private playground. I don't care who you are. I don't care who your family is (Richard & Emily don't look pleased). When you commit a crime Miss Gilmore, there must be consequences. Period. Twenty hours of Community Service won't do it! I'm ordering three hundred hours of Community Service, to be completed in no more than six months (Richard & Emily react), and one year?s probation."
"RORY: But, I can't do three hundred hours. I have to get a job."
"JUDGE: Well add that to your list of things you should have thought about before you decided to joy ride on someone else's boat."
"RICHARD: Three hundred hours? This is outrageous. Charlie? (Charlie gestures to Richard to calm down)"
"JUDGE: Now, assuming this is indeed a one-time occurrence, at the end of five years time Miss Gilmore can petition the court to have this expunged from her record."
"EMILY: Record? She's going to have a record? Oh my God!"
"RICHARD: (stands up and approaches Charlie) You never said anything about a record?"
"CHARLIE: Richard, please!"
"RICHARD: Oh, don't Richard please me you two-bit double-talker!"
"JUDGE: (to Richard) Who are you? Sit down!"
"RICHARD: I am her grandfather, Richard Gilmore. This is outrageous. (starts pacing in the courtroom)"
"EMILY: I never should have let her go with the ponytail."
"JUDGE: You are going to have to restrain yourself, sir."
"RICHARD: I will not restrain myself. I will not stand by, and let this girl walk around with a record for five years."
"EMILY: Richard! You're standing on my foot!"
"RICHARD: (to Charlie) I should have never listened to you. Making deals with a twenty-year-old child in a cheap suit."
"PROSECUTOR: Hey!"
"JUDGE: I'm not duty bound to do so, but I'm happy to give Miss Gilmore the opportunity to withdraw her plea and go to trial. If she does so she'll face additional felony charges. Given the undisputed facts, I'd think very hard about that course of action"
"RICHARD: Well I think it's something to consider."
"RORY: Grandpa, NO! I don't want to go to trial. I'll do the Community Service. Please, just sit down."
"EMILY: Richard, sit down."
"RORY: I do not want to withdraw my plea your honour."
"JUDGE: All right. I will consider this matter settled. Court will recess for twenty minutes. (exits)"
"POLICE OFFICER: All rise."
"CHARLIE: This is not that big a deal. We got a little more Community Service than we wanted."
"RICHARD: (approaches Charlie & Rory. To Charlie) You're a lousy duck hunter Charlie. It wasn't the weather and it wasn't the duck call, it was you."
"CHARLIE: I was doing you a favour Richard."
"RICHARD: Well do me some more favours, Charlie. Let's see if we can get the girl twenty to life at Sing-Sing."
"CHARLIE: That is it."
"RORY: (drags Richard away) Grandpa."
"RICHARD: I'm hiring a lawyer to sue that man."
"RORY: Grandpa, did you tell mum about the court date?"
"RICHARD: Of course I did."
"RORY: You did? You told her the time, and where it was and everything?"
"RICHARD: She knew all about it Rory. She simply showed no interest in the matter. (Rory reacts) Abe Rosenstein!"
"RORY: Who?"
"RICHARD: That's who I'm going to get to sue Charlie."
"CHARLIE: (picks up his briefcase) Goodbye Emily. Go to hell Richard. (exits)"
"RICHARD: I'm not through with you yet! (follows Charlie)"
"EMILY: Richard, you can't k*ll him here! We're in a courthouse! (follows Richard)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, night. Lorelai reaches the door there is note stuck on the door, she tears it and throw the pieces down. She gets in the house and finds another note. She throws that one away without reading it also. She reaches the answering machine, a note is stuck on that too. She throws it down again. Plays her messages and goes to the kitchen)"
"EMILY (on answering machine): Lorelai it's your mother. I want to thank you for the lovely little surprise you gave me this morning (Lorelai keeps on ripping away notes, without reading them as she moves around the kitchen, and the fridge, without reading them). I can't wait to tell the girls at the club all about it. I mean they're always bragging about their daughters did this, and their daughters did that. Well finally I get to go in there and say ""Oh really? Well today my daughter invited me over and then didn't show up. And then she had me watched by a surly, barking Frenchman so that I didn't steal anything""."
"LORELAI: I didn't invite you over mother!"
"EMILY (on answering machine): Top that, ladies! This was unforgivable Lorelai. Disgraceful behaviour even by your standards. And since I assume you've torn up all of my notes, I will read them to you. I made copies. (Lorelai enters Rory's room and angrily starts packing her stuff) ""Dear Lorelai, I was shocked and saddened by your decision not to be at home when I came by for Rory's things."
"(CUT to Richard & Emily's bedroom. It's dark and they are sleeping. The door opens forcefully Lorelai comes in holding a laundry basket and a big duffel bag. They wake up startled)"
"EMILY: My God!"
"LORELAI: There that?s all of her stuff. (drops the basket) You happy?"
"(Richard turns on the light. Emily sits up in bed)"
"EMILY: Lorelai, you scared me half to death."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well follow through, has always been my problem. Oh well! (drops the duffel bag) So! We've got clothes, books, stuffed animals. I even checked the laundry to make sure nothing was waiting to be washed. OK? We good?"
"RICHARD: What do you mean? Barging in here in the middle of the night. Are you crazy?"
"LORELAI: Mum just seemed extremely concerned, about getting the rest of Rory's things."
"EMILY: She needed something to wear to court."
"LORELAI: Yeah, so I figured I better bring them right over here. Now I did, so I'm done!"
"EMILY: Lorelai, stop this! I know you're upset. I know you hate us..."
"LORELAI: I don't hate you. Why would I hate you?"
"EMILY: Well...because we...because you thought we..."
"LORELAI: You were just being you. You couldn't help it."
"EMILY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: The scorpion and the frog. It's an old story. The scorpion says to the frog ""Hey frog give a lift to the other side of the pond"". Frog says ""No way! You'll sting me and I'll die"". Scorpion says ""Will not! Cause then we'll both drown"". Frog says ""Cool"". So the scorpion gets on the frogs back, and frog makes it to the middle of the pond and the scorpion stings him. As the frog is going down he says ""Why would you do that? Now we'll both die"". Scorpion says ""Sorry. It's just my nature"". Frog (points to herself), scorpion (points to her parents)."
"EMILY: I always thought it was a turtle."
"LORELAI: Whatever it was. You guys couldn't help it."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, why don't you sit and calm down."
"LORELAI: I am calm. I'm fine. You guys must be pretty jazzed though, huh? I mean you finally did it. You finally got a sh*t at getting the daughter you've always wanted."
"RICHARD: I'm too tired to have this conversation."
"LORELAI: Rory! Here! Right under your roof. Excellent!"
"EMILY: You're being ridiculous."
"LORELAI: Now you get your do over. A new and improved Lorelai. Congrats. Very well played."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, listen to me. I know that you think some sort of con has been perpetrated on you..."
"LORELAI: Hey, it's only a paper moon dad."
"RICHARD: That fact of the matter is, your mother and I were just trying to do the right thing. We're all striving for the same goal. We want Rory happy and healthy. Now she's taken a bit of a stumble. But we can get her back on the right track. All of us. Together. And we're going to need your input and your involvement to achieve that."
"LORELAI: My involvement ends here. With the laundry basket."
"EMILY: What is that flipper mark supposed to mean."
"LORELAI: It's supposed to mean that I'm out. You've won. She's all yours. Of course the laundry basket I'm going to want back. (exits)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, same night. Luke & Kirk are in the diner. Kirk is following Luke around. They are heading to the diner door)"
"KIRK: Please Luke, please! Please, please, please, please, please!"
"LUKE: Move (Kirk moves away from he door, outside and Luke locks)"
"KIRK: Luke, I have to have the ring back."
"LUKE: I've paid you for the ring. In fact I've overpaid you for the ring. You gave me a certificate of authenticity and a promise that none of the heirs were gonna sue me for possetion and then our business was done."
"KIRK: Luke, you don't understand. I think that that was the ring that Lulu had her eye on. I totally forgot this until...Where are you going?"
"LUKE: I'm leaving Kirk! The diner is closed!"
"KIRK: You can't leave until I get that ring back. If I propose I'm gonna need that ring."
"LUKE: You have a suitcase full of rings!"
"KIRK: But that's the one I sort of remember her liking."
"LUKE: Pick another ring."
"KIRK: But my backup ring pulled through. Plus now there's talk of her wanting to buried with it."
"LUKE: Goodnight Kirk."
"BABETTE: (from across the square) LUUUUUKE! WAIT!"
"LUKE: Oh boy!"
"BABETTE: I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU!"
"LUKE: OK Babette! Slow down I'm not going anywhere."
"(Babette is running across town, occasionally holding her breasts)"
"BABETTE: It's very serious!"
"LUKE: I'm right here! You just, You can walk Babette. Just walk Babette, please, walk. Slow down, just...(she reaches him)"
"BABETTE: (out of breath) Geez! Oh my God! I smell toast. I smell toast. And almonds. I smell almond toast."
"LUKE: What do you need Babette?"
"BABETTE: I need confirmation on a rumour. That there is a rumour that there's been a rift between Lorelai and Rory."
"KIRK: A rift?"
"BABETTE: A big rift. Very serious, that's right! Rory ain't home for the summer?"
"KIRK: Wow!"
"LUKE: Who told you this?"
"BABETTE: Well who else? East Side Tillie. That damn woman keeps tromping me. So come on? Is she right? Is it true? (Luke doesn't answer and looks uncomfortable) It is true! Oh my God! Well what happened? And how's Lorelai taking it? She must be a basket case? Is she a basket case?"
"LUKE: OK! Stop! Look! There's been a little incident, but all going to be fine. Lorelai has it completely under control."
"BABETTE: She's OK?"
"LUKE: Trust me, she's just fine! OK"
"(Luke pats Babette on the shoulder and walks away. Babette tries to catch her breath. Kirk approaches her)"
"KIRK: Nice ring. (Babette looks strangely at Kirk and walk away)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, same night. Lorelai walks in the house. Puts down her purse and keys, goes to the kitchen and gets a bottle of water out of the fridge. She turns the light of in Rory's now empty room and sits at the truck at the foot of the bed. She looks around a bit, and after a while throws the bottle out of frustration. She covers her face with her hands and starts to cry. Front door opens. Lorelai is startled)"
"LUKE (OS): Full moon! Moment's here! Let's go!"
"(Lorelai wipes her eyes, gets up tries to put on a happy face and walks out of the room)."

"(OPEN in front of the Twickham House, night. Lorelai & Sookie are standing there, looking up at it)"
"LORELAI: It's big"
"SOOKIE: That's what she said."
"LORELAI: Good one"
"SOOKIE: Hey, I'm still twelve."
"LORELAI: I meant the house. It's very big."
"SOOKIE: Very sweet of Luke to have that dream of his. You two living in this house!"
"LORELAI: What do you think there are? Twelve rooms?"
"SOOKIE: At least! I mean you can really go to town in this place. You could have a dedicated sewing room. I mean, that's a no-brainer."
"LORELAI: Are you kidding? I could put a whole loom in one of those rooms. Indulge my long harboured desire to make tapestries"
"SOOKIE: You've been long harbouring that one?"
"LORELAI: I just thought of it, but yeah!"
"SOOKIE: So it's all feeling good, huh?"
"LORELAI: Well it's a little on the Versailles side. I mean I have to keep an eye out for peasants with pitchforks."
"SOOKIE: I meant the relationship. You're engaged for Gosh sakes!"
"LORELAI: Yes! I'm aware!"
"SOOKIE: And sticking?"
"LORELAI: Yes, Sookie, it's sticking!"
"SOOKIE: Good, good!... How 'bout now?"
"LORELAI: I'm totally re-evaluating the whole thing."
"SOOKIE: Really?"
"LORELAI: (exasperated) NO!"
"SOOKIE: Well...You've got priors!"
"LORELAI: Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: You say one thing, but your heart says another."
"LORELAI: Please! Don't give me the whole litany. Especially one that sounds so much like a Kenny Chesney song."
"SOOKIE: I'm just being honest."
"LORELAI: (determined) I'm not going to bolt. I'm staying put."
"SOOKIE: Good. (knowingly) Because the eyes will give you away."
"LORELAI: What do you mean?"
"SOOKIE: If you're thinking of bolting they'll pop out on you, like that runway bride. It's like the eyes are trying to run away first."
"LORELAI: Sookie look at my eyes."
"(Sookie looks into Lorelai's eyes)"
"SOOKIE: OK..."
"LORELAI: How do they look?"
"SOOKIE: Pretty socked in there."
"LORELAI: And there they will remain. Everything's good. Promise"
"SOOKIE: Good. Pretty eyes too."
"LORELAI: I'm taken."
"SOOKIE: Sorry!"
"LORELAI: (turns to look back at the house) WOW!"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Is it me or..."
"SOOKIE: (looks up at the house too) Nope! I think it just got bigger."
"LORELAI: That's what she said."
"SOOKIE: Good grief."
"LORELAI: What!? You can be twelve, but I can't be twelve?"
"SOOKIE: No...You can be twelve."
"LORELAI: Thank you."
"(OPENING CREDITS)"
"(CUT to Community Service orientation. A supervisor is walking around the room, explaining the rules. All the ""felons"" are sitting on desks))"
"SUPERVISOR: Remember to sign in at the get-go. If you do not sign in your work that day will not count against your community service hours, so do it! Same thing at the end. Sign out. Don't forget! Each shift is three and a half hours. Double shifts will include a half hour lunch break and it's bring your own. (picks up a stack of papers and hands them to a person sitting at one of the front desks). Take one down and pass it around. (camera pans to the ""felons"" sitting and follows as the papers get passed around the room). These are your guidelines. They outline safety procedures, behaviour requirements etc. If you cause any trouble you will come back here to see me, something I do not want to happen. Now lets talk about what you will not bring. First on the list w*apon of any kind. I'll state the obvious first. You will not bring a g*n. You will not bring chains. You will not bring knives of any kind, including penknives, nail files, razor blades, carpet cutters. (camera pans to Rory, she looks out of place with all the other people in the orientation) You will not bring rope, you will not bring brass knuckles or anything that can be used as a truncheon."
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Luke & Lorelai come down from the apartment talking)"
"LUKE: And they have those flash light thingies"
"LORELAI: Yeah! That's the right name for those. Flash Light Thingies."
"LUKE: And Jedi powers of mind control, and they can move things, so they're telekinetic. And they hover on their jet saucers over molten lava, and they can jump and fly around like they're in Cirque Du Soleil..."
"LORELAI: Ah! Coffee, please. (Luke goes behind the counter to get the coffee, Lorelai sits on a stool)"
"LUKE:...But what gives one Jedi knight the edge over the other, huh? The ultimate advantage? They stand on a mound of dirt and declare, ""you can't win. I've got the high ground."""
"LORELAI: Dude, if he said it that's the way it is. It's a fictional world."
"LUKE: He's four feet up a little sloap, and that wipes out all the other guys powers to fly, jump around, move things with his brain, use his flashlight thingy?"
"LORELAI: You've got to learn the right term for that flashlight thingy!"
"LUKE: This has been bugging me!"
"LORELAI: For months! We saw that movie months ago. You've got to let it go."
"LUKE: I can't!"
"LORELAI: George Lucas owns San Fransisco now. That's a city! You can't argue with a man who owns a city."
"LUKE: All the other guy has to do is scurry onto land, run up a hill a bit, and then he has the high ground. I mean, they can fly jetpods, but they can't scurry?"
"LORELAI: Go on a website or something, OK? Cause there are thousands...no, millions of your kind out there debating all the minutiae of, not just this Star Wars movie, but every Star Wars movie!"
"LUKE: You drag me to see these movies."
"LORELAI: No, you wanted to see that movie."
"LUKE: So I can't critique it because I wanted to see it?"
"LORELAI: That's how it works."
"LUKE: What about ""Bewitched""?"
"LORELAI: (closes her eyes and breathes deep in restrain) Okay, I'm sorry. They screwed up ""Bewitched"". Nicole Kidman, good choice. But that concept?"
"LUKE: You should go on a website"
"LORELAI: No! but ""Bewitched"" is iconic!...Dr. b*mb, Larry Tate. There was no Larry Tate."
"LUKE: (a bit condescending) Hey! Let it go! We saw this months ago!"
"LORELAI: This is different. You can't have ""Bewitched"" without Larry Tate."
"LUKE: Here's your coffee."
"LORELAI: (sighs and takes the to go cup) So should we stop going to movies?"
"LUKE: We should stop caring."
"LORELAI: OK! Bye doll!"
"LUKE: Bye"
"(They kiss and Lorelai exits the diner. Camera follows as Luke walks behind the counter and as he reaches to clean a table we see TJ cleaning up some shelves. He starts to stroke them lovingly)"
"TJ: You see these?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I saw them before TJ. Stop doing that. It's creepy."
"TJ: (stands up straight by the shelves proudly) Some of my best work these shelves."
"LUKE: They seem very shelfy."
"TJ: You're not excited."
"LUKE: I tend not to get to excited about things like shelves."
"TJ: I hate that you've lost the little boy in you."
"LUKE: Don't cry for me"
"(They walk away from the table. Luke goes behind the counter. TJ follows from the other side of the counter)"
"TJ: By the way, I'm throwing in my top shelf as an engagement gift for you, brother-in-law."
"LUKE: Great! Thanks."
"TJ: Of course, my per-shelf rate's gone up since we last talked. So it all comes out to the same money."
"LUKE: Yeah...well, funny how that works."
"TJ: It's very exciting that Lorelai's gonna be my sister-in-law. Having another hot girl in the family is gonna be tres cool."
"LUKE: Uh-huh."
"TJ: People are really gonna stare when the two of us are squiring our delectable wives around."
"LUKE: I don't know just how much mutual squiring you and I are going to be doing."
"TJ: You got to admit our wives are hot. (draws in the air with his hands a woman's body) Va-va to the voom."
"LUKE: (disturbed) T.J... Your wife is my sister."
"TJ: That don't make you blind, does it? Va-va...(starts to do the air drawing thing again)"
"LUKE: Don't go to the voom again!"
"TJ: Mr. Sensitive."
"LUKE: You're done here, right? Don't you have somewhere to go?"
"TJ: I'm pretty free. I was gonna go home and watch ""Bewitched"" on dvd, but your woman spoiled that for me."
"LUKE: Yeah...I got to check something out in the storeroom. (starts walking towards the storeroom. TJ follows him and stops him before he leaves)"
"TJ: Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait. Wait. Wait. I need your okay on something."
"LUKE: As long as it doesn't involve my sister."
"TJ: It pays to advertise, right? I want to put a sign up on the shelves to let people know who did them. ""Shelves by AJ"""
"LUKE: AJ? Why AJ? Why not TJ?"
"TJ: 'Cause I'm going in the yellow pages, and I want to be up at the top. ""T"" puts me after everything except ""u,"" ""v,"" ""w,"" ""x,"" ""y,"" and ""z"" and I think a few others. Smart, huh?"
"LUKE: Yeah, well I just don't want you advertising here, T.J."
"TJ: Well, is it okay if I give out my card to any inquiring party? (gets out a card from his toolbelt and gives it to Luke)"
"LUKE: Sure, if they inquire, give them a card. (reads the card) You crossed out ""Ralph's Shoe Repair"" and wrote in ""AJ Construction."" That's your card?"
"TJ: I don't technically have cards. So I take them from other businesses and write my own stuff in it."
"LUKE: You wanna...You might want to cross out the picture of the guy shining the boot. It might confuse things."
"TJ: Thanks. (Luke exits to the storeroom) What a team, huh? What a team? (TJ approaches two customers sitting on the counter) How about those shelves, huh? You plus your fat cousins could sit on them. They wouldn't break. They're that strong. Here, take a card. (gives them a card)"
"(CUT outside to Stars Hollow pet fair, same day. Lorelai is walking around looking at the animals)"
"LORELAI: Hello, porky! Hello. O-h-h-H! Well, I'm feeling a little guilty because of the you-L.T I had yesterday. That's right, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Hi, fellas. What's up? You both look like k*ll. (sees a cage with a cute furry mutt) Hey. Hey, you! Oh, someone seems very happy."
"FAIR SALES PERSON: He likes you, and he's picky."
"LORELAI: He's cute. You're cute. You're shaggy cute. Oh, we got a love thing going on, don't we? (Miss Patty approaches Lorelai)"
"MISS PATTY: (accusingly) What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: I'm just enjoying the animals, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: (to fair sales person) Honey, this is not right. She can't have a love thing with a dog."
"FAIR SALES PERSON: She can't?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I can. Go about your business there, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: You must have her name on some blacklist back there, don't you?"
"FAIR SALES PERSON: We don't have a blacklist."
"MISS PATTY: But this is Lorelai Gilmore."
"LORELAI: Ignore her. (to Patty) This dog loves me. And the pig...the pig loved me."
"MISS PATTY: It looks dead."
"LORELAI: It's sleeping. (to fair sales person) They sleep, right?"
"FAIR SALES PERSON: Actually, that's very unusual for her to be sleeping. (to anohter fair member) Meg, make sure the pig's okay."
"LORELAI: Yeah, the pig's fine."
"MISS PATTY: (accusingly) You didn't touch it, did you?"
"LORELAI: I did not k*ll the pig, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: You got a bad record. You got to admit it."
"LORELAI: That thing with the hamster was a long time ago. It was a long time ago! And..and it was only a hamster. I mean it's not really in the same category as dog or pig, now, is it?"
"MISS PATTY: What about the rabbit?"
"LORELAI: Okay, the rabbit was sick when I got it. It was sick when I got it! It was actually very humanitarian of me to take it in the first place."
"MISS PATTY: And that poor turtle. It was supposed to outlive you."
"LORELAI: Kay! You're really kind of bringing down the pet fair here, Patty."
"MISS PATTY: Honey, go see ""March Of The Penguins."" That's really as close to the animals as you should get. (walks away)"
"LORELAI: (to fair sales person) She's a comedienne, that one. She just gets a bit, and then she keeps on going, you know, even with one that's not funny. It's a (far sales person walks away)...(to the dog) Hi. See you later, kiddo."
"LIZ: (running towards Lorelai) Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Liz, hi. (they hug)"
"LIZ: You and Luke engaged!"
"LORELAI: Yes, we are!"
"LIZ: I want to eat your face."
"LORELAI: Is that good?"
"LIZ: You're my sister-in-law. Mrs. Danes, not that you're changing your name. You don't got to. Go modern."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do."
"LIZ: (takes Lorelai's hand in hers and inspects the ring) This ring. My brother has good taste."
"LORELAI: Yes, he does."
"LIZ: You ever see my ring?(hold out her ring finger) It's a beaut, huh?"
"LORELAI: Definitely."
"LIZ: Had a problem with it for a while. It turned my finger green."
"LORELAI: Well, that's common with metal."
"LIZ: No, it's worse than that. The finger turned green, then it turned blue, then purple. So, I went to this doctor, and he's talking amputation."
"LORELAI: Oh, my god!"
"LIZ: But TJ picked it out for me, so I love it, I really do."
"LORELAI: It's the thought that counts."
"LIZ: Well, I got to get going. I actually have a finger-therapy session I have to go to. Sister-in-laaaws! (hold up her ring, and Lorelai reluctantly joins her)"
"LORELAI: Sister-in-laws!"
"LIZ: Oh, I'm a jerk."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LIZ: I forgot to ask you about Rory."
"LORELAI: Right."
"LIZ: So, is she staying here with you during the summer break?"
"LORELAI: (uncomfortable) Oh, well, actually...Luke didn't tell you about all this?"
"LIZ: All what?"
"LORELAI: She's staying with her grandparents for the summer."
"LIZ: Really?"
"LORELAI: For a change of pace. And she'll be working and...yeah."
"LIZ: Ah! Your whole extended family. You, your parents, so close. It's nice."
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"LIZ: Ow."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LIZ: My finger. Gotta run. Bye. (walks away)"
"LORELAI: Uh...Bye, Liz. (sighs) Looks back at the furry mutt. To fair sales pesron) I'll take him."
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion dinning room. Emily and Richard are having a rather rich breakfast and are working on their schedules)"
"EMILY: So the 14th works?"
"RICHARD: Yeah, works for me. My god, we're busier than that Anne Coulter."
"EMILY: Who?"
"RICHARD: That blond bean pole on TV. If she walked over a subway grate, she'd fall right through."
"EMILY: We need to talk to the gardener."
"RICHARD: Try! I've given up."
"EMILY: I told him to take that mp3 device off his head while he worked, and he did. Then I hid behind the curtains, and he put his mp3 device right back in his ears. (Rory walks in the dinning room and stand around awkwardly)"
"RICHARD: We're paying him too much if he's able to afford an mp3 device."
"EMILY: Well he's got to focus on the lawn. Morning, Rory."
"RORY: Hi."
"RICHARD: The patches of brown. Good morning, Rory."
"RORY: Morning."
"EMILY: OH, speaking of which, we have a cocktail gathering on Wednesday."
"RICHARD: How was ""patches of brown"" speaking of which?"
"EMILY: It's the Sterling-Olivers."
"RICHARD: The age spots."
"EMILY: You worship the sun, you pay the price."
"RICHARD: (chuckles) So, Wednesday with the Oliv...wait a minute. We already have cocktails with the Bransons on Wednesday."
"EMILY: We'll do a drink at each."
"RICHARD: Huh, we've done it before."
"EMILY: Rory, sit, sit!"
"RORY: OK. (sits at her usual place)"
"RICHARD: We're staying on top of your car, by the way."
"RORY: My car?"
"RICHARD: Mmmm. It's still in the shop. What is with our government? Impounding a car and damaging it in the process."
"EMILY: Then refusing to pay for the damage."
"RICHARD: I should tell Scooter Libby about this. I keep forgetting I know a man on the inside. I'll give him a call."
"EMILY: Before an indictment comes down."
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"EMILY: For what?"
"RORY: Well my car is impounded because of the thing with the yacht."
"EMILY: (dismissive) That's forgotten."
"RICHARD: (equally dismissive) Totally forgotten."
"EMILY: (continuing to be dismissive) It didn't happen."
"RICHARD: We'll get you through this community service. Then we'll be through with the matter."
"EMILY: Was the orientation horrible?"
"RORY: No, it went fine. I start my first hours in a couple days."
"EMILY: You're bearing this angelically."
"RICHARD: (looks at his watch) Oh, I've got to run!"
"EMILY: (looks at her watch) Oh, look at that. Me too. (Richard & Emily stand up)"
"RICHARD: Goodbye, Rory. Have a nice day."
"EMILY: Eat the rest of this."
"RORY: (Richard kisses the top of her head) I'll try."
"EMILY: And give the fabric samples in the pool house a good look. The longer we wait, the longer it takes."
"RORY: I'll give them a good look"
"(as Richard and Emily start to exit music starts to play)"
"EMILY: What's that?"
"RICHARD: That's my new ring tone."
"EMILY: I love it."
"RICHARD: I'll have Katie come up with some appropriate suggestions for yours. Maybe some Burt Bacharach."
"EMILY: Wonderful. (the grand parents leave. Rory is left alone in the huge dinning room)"
"(CUT to pool house. Rory is sitting on one of the armchairs with the fabic samples on them watching the pool scene from ""The Graduate"" wearing a bathing suit and a skirt)"
"(CUT to main house. We hear the vacuum. Rory enters walking around bored. The vacuum stops working and the maid walks by. Rory waves at her the maid smiles and walks away. After a b*at Rory follows her)"
"(CUT to the mansion's kitchen. The maid is doing some work as Rory walks in)"
"RORY: (pointing at the coffee maker) May I?"
"ESPERANZA: Si."
"RORY: (pours some coffee) Esperanza, right?"
"ESPERANZA: Si, Esperanza."
"RORY: Tu nombre es muy bonito."
"ESPERANZA: Hablas espaÑol?"
"RORY: Um, no hablo bien, y no hablo mucho."
"ESPERANZA: Lo hablas muy bien."
"RORY: De dónde eres?"
"ESPERANZA: De Guatemala."
"RORY: Guatemala. Tienes familia alli?"
"ESPERANZA: Oh, sí, tengo mucha familia, y quiero traer a mi mama aqui."
"RORY: Oh, si. Y cuantos anos tiene tu mama?"
"ESPERANZA: 72 anos."
"RORY: Oh! (they chuckle)"
"(CUT to kitchen later on. Rory & Esperanza are in deep conversation polishing silver together. Emily walks in)"
"RORY: Le gusta ver footbol en la televisión o le gusta jugar?"
"EMILY: Rory!"
"RORY: Oh! Grandma, you scared me."
"ESPERANZA: Hello, Mrs. Gilmore."
"EMILY: What is going on in here?"
"RORY: Um, we were just...well, we were polishing silver."
"EMILY: Esperanza, the vacuum is still sitting in the foyer. (at the maids blanc stare) The vacuum! THE VACUUM!"
"ESPERANZA: Oh, si! Si. (exits in a rush)"
"EMILY: (to Rory) Tell me she didn't ask you to help."
"RORY: Oh, no, no. She didn't. I just...I don't know. I just thought, I would pitch in."
"EMILY: Well, you shouldn't. This is her job, she's paid to do this."
"RORY: I know."
"EMILY: And what was that language?"
"RORY: Spanish."
"EMILY: Spanish? They don't like it when you talk to them, Rory. It throws them off their axis."
"RORY: She seemed fine."
"EMILY: (inspects Rory's outfit) Is that a bathing suit?"
"RORY: Yeah. Yeah, I was gonna go swimming earlier. (seeing Emily's stern face) In fact, I think I'll go do that now."
"EMILY: Yes, a swim would be good."
"RORY: OK. Well, see you later. (Rory exits. Emily looks around at the silverware Rory was polishing and sighs)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, night. There is a knock on the door. Lorelai answers. Luke comes in)"
"LUKE: Hey! You ready to go?"
"LORELAI: Come in, come in, come in! I want to show you something."
"LUKE: OK."
"LORELAI: (giggles) Or...more accurately, I want to show you someone. (they walk in the living room, which is filled with doggie stuff) Ta-da! Where'd he go?"
"LUKE: Where'd who go? What's all this crap?"
"LORELAI: (disappointed) Aaaww! Yoo-hoo! Come on, dude. We had it all rehearsed and everything. A! Aha! Ha ha. Yeah. Okay. (produces the dog from behind an armchair) Ta-da!"
"LUKE: (surprised and weirded out) It's a dog."
"LORELAI: Yeah! Very good. (to the dog in a funny voice) He's smart, too. Not as smart as you.(carries him to the coffee table and sets him there, sits next to him and starts to pet him)"
"LUKE: What are you doing with a dog?"
"LORELAI: I bought him. Doesn't he look happy?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I guess. (disbelievingly) You bought a dog!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, and he loves me. And he doesn't give his love easily. The only drawback is the name. Cocoa. It's too cutesy. But he's a rescue, so I don't want to freak him out by giving him a new name right away, so, I'm gonna get to the name I want to givr him in baby steps. For the first week, I'll call him Cocoa to get him acclimated."
"LUKE: Acclimated."
"LORELAI: Second week, I'm gonna call him Cokey. Third week ""Kooky"". Fourth week ""Tooky""."
"LUKE: So, you're gonna name him Tooky?"
"LORELAI: No. I'm gonna name him Paul Anka, but it's gonna take a while to get to Paul Anka."
"LUKE: Yeah, I'd say so."
"LORELAI: (gets up from the table) And, you know, this little guy has already taught me something I didn't know! Just because they make it for a dog doesn't mean a dog is gonna like it. Toys, including squeakies (picks up a toy and squeezes it, makes a sound) and the ""whazzup"" variety (picks up another toy that looks like a monkey, squeezes it and it says ""whazzup?""): No interest. Rawhide bones: no interest. Popcorn: scared of it."
"LUKE: Scared of popcorn?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, and also of tissue holders, paperbacks, cds, framed pictures, and lint. Oh! And when I drink something, he gets freaked out like I'm gonna die, and I have to pick him up and rock him like a baby until he calms down. It's been quite a first day for us."
"LUKE: Look, should I ask the question"
"that immediately came to mind"
"when I first saw the thing,"
"or should I just shut up?"
"LORELAI: No. sh**t."
"LUKE: Is it okay for you to..."
"LORELAI: (cuts Luke off)...That hamster was defective. Period. Plus, they only live like three years, I looked it up. And...and...and he would have been dead by now anyway. So, world, stop with the hamster already."
"LUKE: But the turtle..."
"LORELAI: (cuts him off again) The same thing with the turtle."
"LUKE: Yeah, but they live to be 90."
"LORELAI: I will take care of this dog. I promise. Now, would you like a beer?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: OK. Just distract him while I'm drinking. And don't let him see the (whispers) bottle opener. (they walk to the kitchen. PA is left in the living room)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, continuous. Luke and Lorelai enter. Lorelai goes to the fridge)"
"LUKE: How much did you spend on all this?"
"LORELAI: Tons. (gets two beers out of the fridge and gives one to Luke)"
"LUKE: For a stupid dog."
"LORELAI: You're acting like you don't like dogs."
"LUKE: I don't like dogs."
"LORELAI: (PA enters the kitchen) Shh! He heard you."
"LUKE: He speaks English?"
"LORELAI: Since when do you not like dogs?"
"LUKE: Since all the times I made that really, really clear, which is every time I've ever been around a dog."
"LORELAI: What is there not to like about dogs?"
"LUKE: (sits at the table. Lorelai puts some food for PA) They're dirty, they're a pain to train, they're a pain to wash, they bark when they shouldn't, they jump on you when you don't want them to, they chew things, they shed, they lick themselves, they make your house smell, they make your car smell, and they make you smell."
"LORELAI: (sighs and joins him at the table) You know I think it's very sad that you've lost the little boy in you."
"LUKE: The little boy didn't like dogs, either."
"LORELAI: Oh! You know. I just realized what this is. This is our thing."
"LUKE: What thing?"
"LORELAI: This tradition of ours. You claim to hate everything at first, but it's just your initial stance in a negotiation. And then we talk, and our opinions merge, and we find a happy middle."
"LUKE: No. A lot of times, it's just how I feel, and my mind doesn't change.(PA goes over to his food bowl)"
"LORELAI: OK, oh! he's eating. Come on, let's go! (she gets up and gestures Luke to follow) But don't make any sudden movements, and don't drink and don't look at him. He's very self-conscious about his eating. I'm the same way. That's how I know this is gonna work! Go! Go, go, go! (they exit the kitchen and stare at PA while he's eating through the kitchen door window)"
"LUKE: You do realize your dog has just driven us out of the house?"
"LORELAI: Don't worry. He's a quick eater. Come on. (they start walking)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's porch, continuous. Lorelai and Luke are walking on the porch)"
"LORELAI: Shh."
"LUKE: This is silly."
"LORELAI: What? We can hang out here."
"It's a nice night. (they sit on the couch on the porch) Okay. Now, fill me in. How was your day?"
"LUKE: Well, I talked to some contractors about the Twickham House."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah?"
"LUKE: As soon as we make the offer, they'll let us in. We can start planning stuff. Remodelling, whatever."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: And as soon as we're out of escrow, we can start work."
"LORELAI: Cool. Excellent."
"LUKE: I was thinking we could even pull the crew over here. Do some quick touch-ups before selling."
"LORELAI: Wait. Touch-ups? Where? Here?"
"LUKE: Yeah. It hasn't been painted in a while. Fixing it up will help it sell."
"LORELAI: Right. You know, I've been thinking?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Maybe...we should...hang on to this house."
"LUKE: To rent?"
"LORELAI: No! Not to rent. To use...in some other way."
"LUKE: What other way?"
"LORELAI: Uh...I don't know. we...It could be, like, a paint studio."
"LUKE: We don't paint."
"LORELAI: Well, maybe we'll start. Maybe it's the lack of a studio that's kept us from realizing our love of watercolours."
"LUKE: I don't have a love of watercolours."
"LORELAI: Or I could use it as my recording studio. That would be cool, huh? And when I'm not laying down tracks, I could rent it out to Korn or Iggy Pop or someone. Right? You and me just hanging with Iggy Pop, rocking out, telling stories. Ig's got stories!"
"LUKE: (understanding drawing on him) Uh-huh."
"LORELAI: Or we could use it as a safe house, in case we decide to take up a life of crime. (through the window PA walks up on the staircase and lies down)"
"LUKE: I doubt we're going to do that."
"LORELAI: Well, we could be wrongly accused of a crime we did not commit. And then we'd have to hide out until society realized the mistake, and then we'd be like, ""Hey, no hard feelings. It happens. This is a great country, and thank god we had the safe house."""
"LUKE: If you want, we can just hang on to it and rent it out."
"LORELAI: I don't want anyone else living in it."
"LUKE: They can't live in it, but they can record songs in it?"
"LORELAI: I just think we could use this place. Think about it, OK?"
"LUKE: Yeah, sure. We'll think about it."
"LORELAI: OK. (looks around into the living room and gasps) Oh, look, he's done. And he's in there fast asleep."
"LUKE: Great! Let's go back in."
"LORELAI: OK. Just be careful because he gets scared when you wake him up."
"LUKE: Of course."
"LORELAI: OK. (they start walking back to the house) Oh, and try not to say any words that begin with the letter ""Q""."
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, night. Rory walks in and enters the living room. Richard & Emily seem to be waiting for her)"
"RORY: Hi. I got your note."
"EMILY: Come in, dear."
"RICHARD: We just wanted to speak to you for a minute."
"EMILY: Sit, sit. (Rory sits on one of the couches)"
"RICHARD: We have a club soda all ready for you here."
"EMILY: Is that all right? We can make you something else."
"RORY: No, that's fine. My drink of choice, thank you. (Rory drinks, Emily & Richard stare at her. He hear a grandfather clock ticking in the backround. Rory seems a bit uncomfortable) Refreshing!"
"RICHARD: Now, you said something before about wanting a job."
"RORY: Yes!"
"RICHARD: You're low on money, and I know you'd prefer to earn it rather than be given it...You're a Gilmore."
"RORY: Mmhuh."
"RICHARD: Your grandmother and I are ready to help you with that."
"RORY: With a job?"
"RICHARD: That's right."
"RORY: Well, um, the job thing was before my court thing. 300 hours of community service in 6 months...it's a full-time job in itself, which kind of limits my options as far as work."
"EMILY: That's where we come in. We can swing a couple of options for you that it'll give you the flexibility you need."
"RORY: Really?"
"RICHARD: There are all sorts of things out there for a bright girl such as yourself. They'll bend their schedules for you."
"EMILY: I'll make some appointments and let you know what they are."
"RORY: All right. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. (a new maid enters with a tray)"
"EMILY: Have you met Draguta? She's from Romania."
"RORY: Hi. (the maid looks at Rory in a stern manner and walks away, Rory is taken aback)"

"(CUT to Lorelai's front porch, morning. Lorelai and PA exit the house. PA waits at the top of the few steps, while Lorelai goes down. She turns around as she realises the dog is not following her. She goes back up the steps and pics PA up)"
"LORELAI: That's right. I forgot. You don't like the stairs. Come on, Paul Anka. That's right. I'm skipping the fancy in-between thing and going straight for the gold. I'm calling you Paul Anka. Paul Anka the dog. (Lorelai walks off the screen with the dog in her arms. PA barks aggressively) You don't like mail boxes, got it!"
"(CUT to Gilmore Mansion patio, morning. Rory walks in and there are a bunch of ladies sitting with Emily, having drinks, tea, etc. They are chatting)"
"RORY: Oh, excuse me."
"EMILY: Rory, what a coincidence. We were just talking about you earlier."
"RORY: You were?"
"EMILY: Come in. Sit with us for a minute."
"DAR LADY1: This is Rory?"
"NORA: She's made of porcelain."
"RORY: Uh...I didn't mean to interrupt."
"DAR LADY2: Beautiful skin. (Rory walks towards the ladies and sits on chair next to Emily)"
"DAR LADY3: Like one of your lladros."
"NORA: I want to miniaturize her and set her on my mantel."
"EMILY: You've interrupted nothing."
"DAR LADY3: Nora was just defending her choice."
"RORY: Her choice?"
"EMILY: Cover your ears, Rory."
"NORA: It's Alexander Hamilton, no debate."
"DAR LADY3: Over Washington."
"DAR LADY!: And Jefferson."
"NORA: Direct, proud. That chin and those blazing eyes."
"EMILY: They're discussing the forefathers."
"DAR LADY1: Choosing, to be more accurate."
"RORY: Which was the greatest?"
"NORA: Lover."
"RORY: Oh, dear."
"EMILY: Girls, please. She's just a child."
"DAR LADY3: Most of us picked Washington or Jefferson. There was one vote for James Madison."
"EMILY: Two abstentions."
"NORA: And I chose the stud on the 10."
"EMILY: It's the drinks. I have to start watering them down."
"DAR LADY1: So, we finally meet the famous Rory."
"RORY: I'm famous?"
"EMILY: You're wanted."
"DAR LADY3: She's perfect for us."
"RORY: For what?"
"EMILY: A job's opened up at our DAR Office downtown."
"NORA: We need someone smart, sharp-looking."
"DAR LADY1: And the hours are extremely flexible."
"EMILY: It just fell out of the sky into our laps. Isn't that something?"
"RORY: Yes."
"EMILY: You can even work from home occasionally. It's mostly phone work."
"NORA: You'd be perfect for us."
"RORY: Well, thank you all for thinking of me. And, yes, it does sound perfect."
"EMILY: Good."
"DAR LADY3: When did you join, Rory?"
"RORY: Join?"
"DAR LADY3: The DAR."
"RORY: Oh, um...well, I haven't."
"EMILY: Yet."
"DAR LADY1: She'd have to join to work in the office."
"RORY: Oh."
"NORA: Don't worry. The term ""shoo-in"" was coined for a figurine like you."
"EMILY: Don't worry. The paperwork's all filled out and ready. It's a formality."
"NORA: Do you not eat? Do you not drink? The Irish coffee is astounding."
"EMILY: Oh, yes. Rory, our meeting's done. We're just gabbing. Go change and join us."
"NORA: And be thinking of the forefather you fancy."
"RORY: Well, um, I...I can't."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"RORY: Uh, because I have my, um..."
"EMILY: Your...?"
"RORY: (gestures with her head) My thing."
"EMILY: Your thing."
"RORY: Um...(leans towards Emily and whispers in her ear) my community service. You were supposed to drive me."
"EMILY: Oh, yes. Ladies, I'm sorry. Rory and I have a little outing, and we were having so much filthy fun I forgot the time. (the ladies get up and start to leave)"
"DAR LADY1: Doing a little shopping, Emily?"
"EMILY: Something like that."
"DAR LADY1: Well, have fun."
"DAR LADY3: Lovely gathering, Emily."
"EMILY: Thank you, girls."
"NORA: (to Rory) Oh, you're going to match the drapes in our office perfectly. (she exits)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's driveway, morning. Lorelai parks the Jeep in the driveway and gets out of the car)"
"LORELAI: Come on, boy. Jump out. (PA jumps out of the car) Good boy. Not afraid of jumping. That's something. (as she starts walking towards the house she notices a man standing outside her bedroom window on the roof) Uh, excuse me."
"GEAORGE: Hello."
"LORELAI: Hello. I'm Lorelai, the owner of the house you're standing on."
"GEARGE: I'm George."
"LORELAI: Hi, George. I'm just trying to think of how to ask this in a polite way. Um, are you committing some sort of crime?"
"GEORGE: No."
"LORELAI: But if you were, would you tell me? (another man walks out to the porch from inside the house) Hello."
"SAUL: Howdy."
"LORELAI: (to herself) Fight or flight? Fight or flight?"
"LUKE: Hey!"
"LORELAI: (Luke joins George up on the roof) Luke!"
"LUKE: This is George."
"LORELAI: Oh, we've met."
"SAUL: And I'm Saul."
"LORELAI: Hi, Saul."
"LUKE: (to George) Get what you need?"
"GEORGE: Just about. Saul, you get what you need?"
"SAUL: Just about."
"LORELAI: Wow. I was this close to screaming and siccing the dog on you. (turns to point at PA, who is now in the car with the door closed) How did you get the door closed?"
"LUKE: We're just about done."
"LORELAI: Wha...Done with what?"
"LUKE: Sizing the situation."
"LORELAI: What situation?"
"LUKE: About how many silent joists we need to carry out."
"LORELAI: What's a joist?"
"LUKE: The things that support the load."
"LORELAI: What load?"
"LUKE: The load from the extension."
"LORELAI: Okay, this has officially become the worst first draft of ""Who's on first?"" in history."
"LUKE: It's about enlarging the bedroom. To live here."
"LORELAI: Here? You wanna live here?"
"LUKE: Sure. I don't have a lot of stuff. We just need a little more closet space. A bigger bathroom, bigger bedroom."
"LORELAI: I always wanted a bigger bedroom."
"LUKE: Well, looks like we can do it."
"LORELAI: But what about the Twickham House?"
"LUKE: Too damn big. We can get along fine here for a while. Maybe forever. It's a great house. You love this house."
"LORELAI: I do love this house."
"LUKE: I know. I figured that out from your sudden interest in laying down tracks and becoming a painter."
"LORELAI: Come down here so I can kiss you. All of you."
"LUKE: We'll just be a minute."
"LORELAI: (walks back to the car to get PA. As she reaches to open the door) You locked the door? Dude, come on! I mean, I've got the key, but I'm really curious how you did this."
"(CUT to outside, morning. Emily's car drives up to the community service's get-go. Rory and Emily are having a conversation as Emily parks the car. Emily is reading some things from a sheet of paper)"
"EMILY: Let's see what else. ""When you're eating in the mess hall, never reach across the prisoner next to you"". It's a provocation. It'll get you a fork in your hand."
"RORY: I don't think there's going to be a mess hall."
"EMILY: Well, wherever you're eating, that would apply. What else? ""Don't be arrogant"". But you're not arrogant. ""Don't let anyone give you anything or lend you anything, period. It can get you injured, or k*ll or turned out"". I'm not sure what ""turned out"" means, but they're very careful to warn you off it."
"RORY: Got it."
"EMILY: Now, ""if somebody approaches you with a shiv..."""
"RORY: Do you know what a shiv is, grandma?"
"EMILY: No, what is it?"
"RORY: It's like a crude knife, carved from a soda can."
"EMILY: Oh!...that must be why they advise you to ""yell for a hack to come help you."" What's a hack?"
"RORY: Where did you get this, grandma?"
"EMILY: I had your grandfather's secretary find me info on interacting with fellow prisoners."
"RORY: But we're not prisoners. We're just doing community service."
"EMILY: (eyeing the rest of the people of the Community Service) They look like prisoners."
"RORY: Well, you know, sitting here in the jag staring at them is probably not going to help my popularity."
"EMILY: Oh, you're right. That's on the list, too. Staring: it's bad. You shouldn't do it for more than one or two seconds."
"RORY: I won't."
"EMILY: And they really emphasize that you should ""keep your fight face at home"". I'm guessing that's any sort of aggressive expression, whether you're staring at the person or not. Fight face...remember that."
"RORY: Okay. I'll be fine, Grandma. Thanks for driving me."
"EMILY: Wait. (gives Rory a fancy paper bag, probably with Ror's lunch) Here. That's better than a paper bag."
"RORY: (looking at it in a weird way) Yes, it is."
"EMILY: Oh, and here. (gives Rory a pack of cigarettes)"
"RORY: Cigarettes?"
"EMILY: To barter. It's currency to these people."
"RORY: Thank you, Grandma. I'll call you when I'm done."
"EMILY: Bye, now. And remember, don't stare."
"(Rory nods and gets out of the car. She walks towards the rest of the group. They eye her in a funny way)"
"RORY: (uncomfortable offers the pack of cigarettes) Anyone want a smoke?"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Luke and George are sitting at a table discussing the remodel. Liz is sitting at a table near by)"
"GEORGE: Then you've got to decide on your extras. We can slap up some molding."
"LUKE: Yeah, molding's good. Lorelai'll like that."
"LIZ: She will. She will like that."
"LUKE: (stares at Liz for a b*at) Let's figure on molding of some kind."
"GEORGE: Good."
"LIZ: Good."
"GEORGE: We can add a wainscot, too. And we could do a lugged architrave on the overdoor."
"LUKE: Great!"
"LIZ: Oh! I love a lugged architrave."
"LUKE: (frustrated) Liz."
"LIZ: (turns to Luke & George's table) Oh, hi. (extends a greeting hand to George) I'm Liz."
"LUKE: My sister."
"GEORGE: Hi, Liz."
"LIZ: You're an architect, huh?"
"GEORGE: Yep."
"LIZ: How long have you been an architect?"
"LUKE: This is not your interview, Liz."
"LIZ: Oh, I'm buttoning it now. I'm sorry."
"GEORGE: I need to go anyway, Luke. (Luke and George stand up. George starts gathering his things)"
"LUKE: What's your time frame here, George?"
"LUKE: It's going to take me at least two weeks to draw up a plan. I'll keep you posted."
"LUKE: Good deal. (the men shake hands)"
"LIZ: (pats George on the back as he's exiting the diner) Good deal, George."
"LUKE: (to George as he's leaving) I'll talk to you later. (to Liz) What is wrong with you?"
"LIZ: Whaaa...I'm just excited about all this. A new adventure!"
"LUKE: (walks behind the counter, Liz follows him) But it's not your adventure. It's my adventure. You're in the employee section."
"LIZ: I want to talk to you about something, Luke."
"LUKE: You've done nothing but talk since you got here. Why announce it now?"
"LIZ: You're going to need a contractor for your remodel, right?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LIZ: And you know who I'm married to."
"LUKE: Yes."
"LIZ: He'd be perfect for this!"
"LUKE: TJ? He's not a contractor."
"LIZ: Oh, but he is."
"LUKE: Since when?"
"LIZ: Since he almost passed the test for his contractor's license last month. I mean, he was so close. If he hadn't used all those curse words during the written exam, he'd have had it."
"LUKE: He used curse words?"
"LIZ: When he's enthusiastic about something, he gets very foul. But I blame his mother. She has got a mouth on her. Garbage mouth!"
"LUKE: I don't think he can do the job, Liz. (he walks to a table to clean it up. Liz follows him around)"
"LIZ: Oh, but, my brother, he's working so hard for his license. You should see him! It is so cute. He sits up in bed at night poring through his books and his manuals. He's got this system where he reads a chapter then rewards himself with a junior mint. It's been working great for him."
"LUKE: There is no way in the world that he is getting this job, Liz."
"LIZ: But what about the shelves he made you? I thought you liked them."
"LUKE: They're just shelves."
"LIZ: Oh, what happened to the little boy in you?"
"LUKE: Look, the shelves are nice, but this is a big job. Lorelai loves this house. This is a great house. (he walks back behind the counter, Liz follows him yet again)"
"LIZ: Luke, his life depends on it."
"LIZ: How?"
"LUKE: Because if he doesn't get his ass out of the house and work more...I'm gonna k*ll him."
"LUKE: There's a housing boom out there. There's plenty of work for a good carpenter like TJ."
"LIZ: But every time he interviews for jobs, he starts cursing. He can't help it. People mistake it for him being weird or something."
"LUKE: Imagine that."
"LIZ: Please, big brother! For your little sister."
"LUKE: Liz!"
"LIZ: Just don't say ""No"", OK? Just think about it."
"LUKE: I don't need to think about it."
"LIZ: For me! Think about it."
"LUKE: OK! Fine! I won't say ""No"" for the time being."
"LIZ: Yes! Thank you. That's all I needed was a big fat ""Not a 'No'""."
"LUKE: Whatever. (Liz sits on a stool at the counter and stares at Luke. Luke looks at her and walks away)"
"(CUT to Community Service, morning. Rory is cleaning up trash at the side of the road with the rest of the group. She stabs a piece of garbage another person was aiming for)"
"RORY: Sorry! (Takes the piece of paper she just stabed and trows it back down. The guy picks it up. Rory backs up and bumps onto another girl from the Community Service) OH!"
"LIZA: (to Rory) Watch it. (walks away)"
"RORY: (to Liza) Sorry! (continues to pick up trash)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's bedroom, morning. Lorelai enters with a laundry basket filled with clothes. She puts in on the bed and starts going through the clothes. She notices something on the wall. She starts walking towards it in shock. The camera pans out and we see Lorelai standing in front of a big hole on her bedroom wall)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, continuous. Luke is serving a customer while Lorelai walk towards the diner in shock)"
"LUKE: (taking order) So, it's an omelette, side of bacon..."
"CUSTOMER: What kind of cheese do you have?"
"LUKE: I've got your basics: swiss, cheddar, jack...(Lorelai enters, and grabs Luke's hand and starts dragging him out of the diner)Hey, what? What? Hey. Lorelai, what are you doing?"
"(CUT in front of Lorelai's house, continuous. Lorelai is still dragging Luke)"
"LUKE: Lorelai? This is weird, okay? I...Come on, what's wrong? Lorelai, say something. (they reach the front of the house)"
"LORELAI: (pointing at the hole) Hole!"
"LUKE: How...?"
"LORELAI: Hole!"
"LUKE: ...it..."
"LORELAI: Hole!"
"LUKE: I know it's a hole. How did it happen?"
"LORELAI: Dirt!"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Dirt, bed! Dirt, hole!"
"LUKE: OK, speak in sentences, come on. You...you found this when you got home."
"LORELAI: Yes, a big hole!"
"LUKE: It was sledgehammered."
"LORELAI: With a very big sledgehammer."
"LUKE: God, who would...(realisation drawing on him) Oh, my god."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: (mad) Him."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"LUKE: Him."
"LORELAI: What him?"
"LUKE: (deathly whisper) k*ll."
"LORELAI: k*ll who?"
"LUKE: TJ!"
"LORELAI: TJ did this?"
"LUKE: Who else?!"
"LORELAI: What do you mean, ""Who else""? Why would TJ come over to my house and sledgehammer my bedroom?"
"LUKE: Damn it, Liz!"
"LORELAI: What did Liz do?"
"LUKE: Ah, she worked me over. She begged me to hire TJ as the contractor on the remodel."
"LORELAI: TJ's a contractor?"
"LUKE: No, and I said ""No""! But she made me promise to think about it. And then she sat in the diner staring at me, and then she started to cry, so I kicked her out. And then she went outside and cried and so I could see it through the window. And I couldn't take it anymore, so I said, ""OK"", knowing we had weeks to figure out how to get out of it. And no work could be done 'cause George hadn't made up the plans. And, in the meantime, TJ could've changed occupations or injured himself bouncing up and down on his trampoline and backed out of the job."
"LORELAI: But how could you risk saying ""oK"" to anything with TJ?"
"LUKE: Did I mention the crying? Liz is a walking tear duct. Oh, TJ's good! You never see what's coming. Like a big, dumb tsunami. He's that good!"
"LORELAI: So, what do we do?"
"LUKE: I'm gonna talk to TJ, but I'm gonna be smart about it, I'm not gonna spook him. I'm gonna be like Michael Corleone dealing with that slimy brother-in-law of his. Get a couple of tickets to a ball game, invite him along. And we'll talk about the beer and the hot dogs we're gonna eat. And then I'm gonna get him to admit that he did this. And then when we get in the car on the way to the ball park, I'm gonna put a rope around his neck and pull it till he's (pulls an imaginary rope) Dead!"
"LORELAI: Wait, Wait! You're in the backseat?"
"LUKE: Yeah! That's the best for garroting. Yes!"
"LORELAI: No, he's gonna smell something fishy if you hop in the backseat especially if you're driving."
"LUKE: No, he's not that bright. It'll work!"
"LORELAI: Why are you even buying the tickets? You could just sneak up on him and garrote him on the street. Save you the money."
"LUKE: I can still go to the game the other way! I'll take my friend Ed. He hasn't been to a game in ages."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you're in no state to deal with TJ right now."
"LUKE: Maybe not."
"LORELAI: And we need to do something about the fact that my bedroom is on display for all to see."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: So, let's figure out what we need to deal with the hole. First things first."
"LUKE: (they start walking towards the house) You're right. We need tarp."
"LORELAI: Tarp."
"LUKE: And some plywood."
"LORELAI: Plywood."
"LUKE: Staple g*n."
"LORELAI: Staple g*n."
"LUKE: And rope."
"LORELAI: You're not garroting TJ."
"LUKE: Skip the rope."
"LORELAI: No rope."
"LUKE: I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: It's not your fault."
"LUKE: Eh...I'm dumb."
"LORELAI: No, you're not."
"LUKE: I'm gonna k*ll him!"
"LORELAI: No, you're not!"
"(CUT to pool house, morning. Rory enters. She seems to be back from her Community Service. She looks filthy and tired. She walk over to the pool house kitchen counter where there is a DAR folder waiting for her. She opens it up and looks around miserably)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, night. Luke is escorting a customer to the door. It seems to be near closing time)"
"LUKE: Goodnight, see you again. (he walks over to the counter and starts working on the bills. The diner door opens) Sorry. Kitchen's closed. (turns around and sees Rory at the door) Rory!"
"RORY: Hi, Luke."
"LUKE: Hi."
"RORY: So, kitchen's closed."
"LUKE: No, no, no! It's not closed. Come on in. (he goes behind the counter to get the coffee pot and a cup, Rory sits on a stool at the counter)"
"RORY: (Luke starts pouring coffee) Oh!"
"LUKE: Oh, no. I...I just...I figured."
"RORY: No! Yes! You figured right, thank you! (Luke fills up the cup) So, it looks like the town's been doing a little painting."
"LUKE: Yeah, Taylor wanted to spiff it up. Those are his words. Put these obnoxious signs up. ""Pardon our spiff, it'll just take a jiff"". It's dumb."
"RORY: Yeah! Dumb."
"LUKE: But it...it needed a...spiff."
"RORY: Yeah, it looks good. So, I started my community service."
"LUKE: Right!"
"RORY: A little roadwork. Vest and all. 5 hours down, 295 to go."
"LUKE: It's good you're chipping away at it."
"RORY: Yeah."
"LUKE: Yeah..."
"RORY: So...how are people? Are people good?"
"LUKE: Yeah, people are good. People are, uh...(Looks uncomfortable and sighs) Your mom and I are engaged."
"RORY: Engaged?"
"LUKE: (nods) Yeah."
"RORY: Wow. (holding back tears) Congratulations!"
"LUKE: Thanks."
"RORY: So, I guess I'm gonna go. (gets up from the stool) Um...thank you, for the coffee. (exits the diner. Luke looks miserable)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, early in the morning. Some sort of construction is going on and a ladder is standing up against the porch. Lorelai comes out of the house, she was obviously just woken up by the noise)"
"LORELAI: TJ."
"TJ: Lorelai, hey. Am I glad to see you."
"LORELAI: It's like seven a.m., TJ."
"TJ: I know the sun ain't even warm yet, and here we are toting that barge. Mr. Taskmaster."
"LORELAI: Who? Who has got you toting a barge?"
"TJ: Look. I need to explain my side in the whole hole thing here. It wasn't my fault."
"LORELAI: It wasn't?"
"TJ: A guy says ""OK"", that means something to me. You know what it means? It's not so complicated, not like the TV guide or nothing. It means ""OK""."
"LORELAI: It's really early, TJ."
"LORELAI: Anyway. I just don't want you to be mad at me. We're gonna be related, you and me."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm not mad at you, TJ."
"LUKE FROM OS: Hey, get away from her."
"TJ: We're just talking."
"LUKE: (from on the roof) TJ, stop bothering her, and get up here."
"TJ: You want me to bring up a couple more trash bags? I'm figuring we need some."
"LUKE: OK. Fine."
"TJ: Now, is that OK in the sense that I know that word, Or is that a ""Luke OK"" that can mean whatever you want it to mean?"
"LUKE: Just get up here."
"TJ: He knew I was a self-starter. OK to a self-starter is like glue to a horse. What else can you do but start galloping? (climbs the ladder to the top of the roof)"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Are you aware of the time?"
"LUKE: I'm just trying to make it so you don't have to sleep on the couch for the next three months. If you want us to stop, we'll stop."
"LORELAI: No, it's just...the sun ain't even warm yet."
"TJ: Seven a.m. was Luke's idea. I'd have started at nine so as not to bother people. That's just one guy who thinks that OK means OK's opinion."
"LUKE: Would you just keep working?"
"LORELAI: So, maybe tomorrow, if you're still doing this, it could be eight...ish. I mean, I love that you're doing it, but..."
"LUKE: Yeah, I needed to start early so I could get this done. Man!"
"LORELAI: Hey! What's with the 'tude?"
"LUKE: Nothing. It's just...You know you got a frisbee up here?"
"LORELAI: A what?"
"LUKE: A frisbee. Just sitting up here! I mean what are you thinking with that?!"
"LORELA: It's not my frisbee."
"LUKE: So it just walked up here on its own?"
"LORELAI: Luke, there is a lost frisbee on the roof of every suburban home in America. No less a luminary than Garrison Keillor said that. It's not that big a deal."
"LUKE: Every roof, huh? Well, that's a great use of plastic."
"LORELAI: It's not my frisbee. I've never played frisbee. What the hell has gotten into you?"
"LUKE: I told Rory we were engaged."
"LORELAI: What?! How? Where?"
"LUKE: She came into the diner last night. It was awkward and stupid. I ended up telling her we were engaged."
"LORELAI: Why?! Why would you do that?"
"LUKE: Why? Because she had the face."
"LORELAI: What face?"
"LUKE: The Rory face. You know the face."
"LORELAI: Yes, but, Luke, you have to ignore the Rory face."
"LUKE: That's easy for you to say."
"LORELAI: You shouldn't have told her."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you should've told her!"
"LORELAI: NO! She shouldn't have been told anything. So neither of us should've told her."
"LUKE: But if one of us isn't gonna tell her more, then I'm the one that shouldn't."
"LORELAI: Right. Meaning not you. I should've told her."
"LUKE: Then we're in full agreement. You should've told her."
"LORELAI: No! That's not what I'm saying."
"LUKE: Well you said it, and I agreed, so I win."
"LORELAI: How do you win?"
"LUKE: Because I have the high ground. That gives me the upper hand on anything you got."
"LORELAI: Luke."
"TJ: (holding up a drill) Something's wrong with this thing."
"LUKE: There's nothing wrong with that thing! (picks up the frizbee)"
"LORELAI: Luke! Rory started this. And right now we're not talking. Remember, tough love? I'm on a path here."
"LUKE: She would've seen it in the paper eventually."
"LORELAI: Seen what?"
"LORELAI: Our engagement."
"LORELAI: How would it have ended up in the paper?"
"LUKE: I don't know. She'd open up the paper to the back to one of these stupid pictures of a guy and a girl. Bill's a chiropractor. Nancy's a teacher. They met square dancing. They're on their honeymoon in Florida. And they got these smiles on their faces like their lives are gonna work out the way they dreamt or something...suckers! Those things."
"LORELAI: You played right into her hands. You can't do that. She can't just play on our emotions. She has to undo what she's done. Get out of my parents' house. Go back to school."
"LUKE: Fine! Maybe I shouldn't have told her anything. Maybe I should've kicked her out, ignored her, whatever! But you got to understand something: I'm in the middle! Yeah, she's your daughter, but I'm in the middle!"
"LORELAI: (apologetic) I know. You are in the middle."
"LUKE: Good! Because you've been acting like you don't know, like you're alone in this or something."
"LORELAI: I know."
"LUKE: And I know you don't want my opinion on this, but you're both being dumb, and you should be talking. There. I won't say anything more about any of this again ever. (TJ seems to be having a hard time with the drill, Luke approaches him) TJ. the screw's not going in right 'cause you got the drill on counterclockwise. It's righty-tighty, lefty-loosey."
"TJ: I've got to remember that."
"LUKE: Ugh. (to Lorelai) Right! I got to get back to work. We're gonna be done with what we're doing here today. We won't be here tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: We're okay."
"LORELAI: Good. (Luke throws the frisbee at her. Lorelai catches it)"
"LUKE: Nice catch. (Lorelai looks pleased)"
"TJ: Yes! That's what I'm talking about. Righty-tighty! (Luke takes the drill from TJ)"
"(CUT to Community Service, morning)."
"ROAD SUPERVISOR: OK guys ten minutes for lunch."
"(Liza bumps into Rory provocatively as she's fiddling with a garbage bag. Rory bumps into Liza in the same manner. Liza pushes Rory. Rory pushes her back. The girls start fighting. Other people from the Community Service and the road Supervisor break them up)"
"ROAD SUPERVISOR: Whoa, whoa! Break it up! Come on! Break it up!"
"(CUT to the Community Service orientation classroom. The first supervisor is talking to Rory)"
"SUPERVISOR: You're on the side of the road. Cars rushing by, trucks, tractor trailers. You see my point? That's not a playground out there. It's a work environment with inherent dangers. Obvious dangers. And there you are pushing someone around. That's unacceptable. Now, I cannot have you out there with your fight face on. Do you understand me?"
"RORY: Yes, sir."
"(CUT to Lorelai's Jeep, morning. Lorelai is driving listening to some music. She drives by the Community Service spot and she sees Rory. She stops the car and gets out. Rory is talking to the Road Supervisor)"
"ROAD SUPERVISOR: What's the problem?"
"RORY: We're gonna need another thing of bags for this next stretch."
"COMMUNITY SERVICE ROAD SUPERVISOR: Well, then, you're gonna have to check back on the bus. (walks away)"
"RORY: Thanks for nothing."
"LORELAI: (to Rory) Repaying your debt to society, I assume."
"RORY: That's what this is."
"LORELAI: System already hardened you?"
"RORY: So, I guess congratulations are in order."
"LORELAI: So, how are things at the new digs?"
"RORY: You guys set a date yet?"
"LORELAI: Grandma redecorate the pool house yet?"
"RORY: Be sure to send me a picture."
"LORELAI: Be sure to send me a change-of-address card. Grandma can print them out for you, with a little fleur-de-lis."
"RORY: I'm not supposed to be talking to outsiders."
"LORELAI: Fine. (turns around and walks away)"
"RORY: You and Luke getting engaged and not telling me about it. You hurt me."
"LORELAI: Back at you"

"(OPEN in Lorelai's living room, morning. Lorelai is sleeping and PA is lying on the floor near by. Lorelai wakes up and get's out of bed)"
"LORELAI: (to PA) Hi! Lets get us a little breakfast. Come on. Come, Paul Anka."
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, continuous. PA enters the kitchen and sits on a chair. Lorelai follows him and proceeds to prep up what seems to be a breakfast bouffe)"
"(CUT to outside of Lorelai's house, continuous. The construction crew is working on the house while Lorelai walks out on the porch)"
"LORELAI: (to workers) Breakfast! Get it while it's room temperature and nutrient-free!"
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, continuous. The crew is crammed in the kitchen helping themselves to breakfast)"
"LORELAI: Milk, cream, and sugar's on the table. Flo's got coffee. Who needs a jolt?"
"WORKER1: I do."
"LORELAI: OK. (pours him coffee) Inspect the bagels closely, because the expiration date was in Braille, apparently, and either they're new or from my baby shower. I'm also sorry to report that we are currently out of the brown sugar cinnamon pop-tarts..(hold up the pop-tart bag)"
"WORKERS: (disappointed) Ohh!"
"LORELAI: Huh! Don't ""ohh!"" me. You guys've been playing favourites all week and now it's time to pay the piper. So someone be a man, suck it up and start eating the shredded wheat. (puts the new box of pop tarts on the table)"
"WORKERS: (they groan) Ah...come on..."
"LORELAI: Cowards. (a worker extends his watch hand to pet PA who's still sitting on the chair, Lorelai stops him) Oh, hey, ooh! Remember, people, only pet the dog with your non-watch hand. In case you don't remember: Watches cause him to freak out, jump up on the counter, and kick my once-working toaster across the room."
"LUKE: (entering the kitchen holding a big box from Luke's) Your muffins."
"LORELAI: My...what?"
"LUKE: You left me an urgent message about needing muffins."
"LORELAI: Oh, Right! (to workers) Muffins, boys!"
"LUKE: These were for them?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no. They were for me. I thought I'd try to eat my weight in muffins today."
"LUKE: Does the dog have to sit in the chair like that?"
"LORELAI: Like what? His posture's perfect."
"LUKE: Chairs are for people."
"LORELAI: Not that chair. That's Paul Anka's chair."
"LUKE: Dogs are filthy. They have fleas and malaria on them. You shouldn't have fleas and malaria in the room that you're gonna eat in."
"LORELAI: I don't eat in here, (pointing to the workers) they do."
"LUKE: (to workers) Enjoying your free breakfast there, fellas? Nice free coffee there, Craig. Nice free muffin there, Benny."
"LORELAI: Gee, Luke. I don't think they know what you're getting at."
"LUKE: OK. That?s good. You done here? Cause Tom wants to talk to us."
"(CUT to outside of Lorelai's house, continuous. Luke and Lorelai walk on the porch. TJ is walking amongst the workers bossing them around. Tom is also around)"
"TJ: All right, Norman. I'm gonna need you to find me some cripple studs for that bearing wall we're putting in."
"Cause once that sucker's vertical, we got to be ready to nail in those joists."
"TOM: Just keep doing what you're doing there, and then bring those tools up to Chick."
"TJ: So, Steve, later today we're gonna need to dig a footing drain all around the perimeter about 5 feet deep."
"That ought to keep the basement dry. Hey Jim...(walks away)"
"STEVE: (to Tom) This house doesn't have a basement."
"TOM: No, it certainly does not.(Tom approaches Luke and Lorelai who are standing on the porch)"
"LUKE: OK! This is ridiculous. How long are you gonna let TJ think that he's the contractor?"
"LORELAI: To the very end, my friend."
"LUKE: This is stupid. We have to tell him the truth."
"LORELAI: No, look how happy he is strutting around in his tool belt and shiny silver helmet. You know he polishes that thing every night after work?"
"LUKE: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yes, really! With real silver polish. That's what he thinks silver polish is for: to polish anything that's silver. I think that's adorable."
"TOM: And the good news is, he's got terrible instincts. But he combines that with absolutely zero follow-through, so it all works out in the end."
"LORELAI: (to Luke) Huh? Terrible instincts, zero follow-through... all the qualities you want in a good pretend contractor."
"LUKE: But we're paying TJ a contractor's salary to do a job that he's not actually doing. And you're paying Tom an extra 10% to pretend he's not doing a job that TJ thinks he's doing but Tom is actually doing. You should hire Blake Edwards as your contractor."
"TOM: Oh, no! TJ'S playing with the circular saw. (runs towards TJ)"
"LUKE: (mumbling) Oh, man..."
"LORELAI: What!...Tom will get to him before he even finds the ""on"" switch."
"LUKE: We're going to tell him."
"LORELAI: Luke, he is your brother-in-law."
"LUKE: Just because Liz married him."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but this makes him happy. Which makes Liz happy, which will make you happy, which will make me happy."
"LUKE: Well, just so you know, I'm gonna oversee this entire thing. OK? I'm gonna make sure TJ doesn't blow the house up."
"LORELAI: And I appreciate that. Now will you please go make the guys an extra pot of coffee? I'm gonna go to Babette's and take a shower."
"LUKE: Why? Your shower's working."
"LORELAI: oh..well..yeah...we just had a little incident in here yesterday."
"LUKE: What kind of an incident?"
"LORELAI: Nothing big. Some of the guys saw me naked."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: It's no big thing."
"LUKE: How in hell did a couple of guys see you naked?"
"LORELAI: Well I was getting out of the shower, and Joe..."
"LUKE: Joe? Joe saw you naked?"
"LORELAI: And Pete."
"LUKE: Pete!"
"LORELAI: Well Pete was with Joe, and then Slim..."
"LUKE: Slim saw you naked?!"
"LORELAI: Well I could see him, so I assume he could see me. Billy had the best view, just a straight sh*t right down main street."
"LUKE: So four guys saw you naked?"
"LORELAI: Well if you don't count Teddy, then"
"yes!"
"LUKE: What in the hell were those guys doing up there in the first place?"
"LORELAI: TJ accidentally sent them up."
"LUKE: I'm gonna k*ll him."
"LORELAI: Luke, it was no big deal. Please! We all laughed about it. Look, from now on, I'm showering at Babette's, so show's over. No one sees the goods but you. OK?"
"(Lorelai kisses Luke and exits. She walk past Norman who then approaches Luke, pats him on the back and gives him an approving nod. Luke does not look pleased)"
"(OPENING CREDITS)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion dining room, morning. Rory and Emily are sitting at the table, having breakfast. A maid serves them)"
"RORY: They're good."
"EMILY: They're stale. And the blueberries aren't even blue. They're red. My God! These blueberries are red!"
"RORY: They're raspberries."
"EMILY: Well the box said they were blueberry. It was printed right on the side."
"RORY: Actually, I was in the kitchen, and the box said..."
"EMILY: (cuts Rory off) She just k*ll me, that woman."
"RORY: It really wasn't as provocative as you think, Grandma."
"EMILY: (picks up a piece of paper and starts reading from it) ""On my last visit to the office, I noticed the foliage on the right side of the entrance looked a little peaked. We might want to let the gardener know. Ta, ladies."""
"RORY: Again. It's not exactly Martin Luther nailing the 95 theses to a door."
"EMILY: It's implying that I have no control over my hirelings at the DAR. I'm the president. The foliage on the right side of the door, which looks fine, by the way, is my responsibility. This is a direct frontal as*ault on my leadership. The woman's plotting a coup."
"RORY: This is Constance, right?"
"EMILY: Constance Betterton. Ever since the Mastersons' Christmas party, when I mentioned that Constance's husband sells used cars for a living, which he does - he calls them ""pre-owned"", but they are used - she's had it in for me. She's gonna run against me in the next election. You don't try to oust a president of the DAR, after one term. It's an insult!"
"RORY: I think you will b*at her handily."
"EMILY: Did I tell you she tried to push me down the stairs once?"
"RORY: Look, Grandma. Don't worry. You have someone on the inside now."
"RORY: I do? Who?"
"RORY: Me."
"EMILY: Oh. Yes!"
"RORY: I'll keep an eye on Constance, from now on. Let you know when she comes in, when she uses the computer, when she's inspecting the landscaping..."
"EMILY: Well, that's wonderful! But stay out of the stairwell."
"RORY: Will do."
"EMILY: (starts eating her breakfast) Mmm! Raspberry. I like raspberry!"
"(CUT to Community Service, morning. Rory is walking around doing her Community service with great ease and determination. She seems to have taken up a leading role in the whole garbage picking thing)"
"COMMUNITY WORKER1: Twist ties?"
"RORY: Twist ties over there. Is that bag half full or half empty, Jules? Oh, you're making me an optimist, my friend."
"LIZA: (walks up to Rory) Rory?"
"RORY: Liza?"
"LIZA: (needy) Rory?"
"RORY: No! We agreed. Not until the end of your shift."
"LIZA: But, I don't think the patch works on me. (she lifts her shirt a bit to reveal her stomach, and we see she's wearing several nicotine patches)"
"RORY: That is like a billion milligrams of nicotine."
"LIZA: Is that bad?"
"RORY: Just, go sit by the cooler, have some water, and take those off. (Liza walks away)"
"ROAD SUPERVISOR: (approaches Rory) Problem?"
"RORY: No. I just told her to get water. She seems really dehydrated."
"ROAD SUPERVISOR: Looks pretty good."
"RORY: Yeah! I think we've hit a really good rhythm here. I've paired up Rinaldi and Spiro, which worked out very efficiently. Sanderson got a little grumpy toward the end of the day, but it's 'cause he wants to be noticed, and he is by far our best spearman. Also we need to remember to pack a couple of extra trash spears tomorrow. The McFarland brothers are using the trash pickup to get out some of that pent-up aggression, which is psychologically healthy but hard on the equipment."
"ROAD SUPERVISOR: Got it. So, what's it looking like?"
"RORY: Well, our quota's up. The kids are tired. I think it's time to call it a day."
"ROAD SUPERVISOR: Do it!"
"RORY: All right, everybody. Let's bring it in! (the community workers start gathering their stuff)"
"LIZA: Hey! A bunch of the girls are going out for pizza, if you want to come."
"COMMUNITY WORKER2: I'll come."
"LIZA: Are you a girl?"
"COMMUNITY WORKER2: No."
"RORY: I would, but I can't. I've got a 3-hour shift at the nursing home."
"LIZA: I can't believe how much community service they stuck you with. What the hell'd you do?"
"RORY: I sh*t a man in Reno. (Liza starts laughing and after bit it turns into coughing) Give it! (Liza gives Rory a pack of cigarettes, and the girls start to walk off, while Liza is still coughing)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn, morning. Lorelai and Paris are having some sort of lunch date at the Inn dining room. They are sitting at a table, Paris is talking and Lorelai looks bored)"
"PARIS: The truth is, this is the first time in my life that I've consistently spent the night with a man."
"LORELAI: Uh huh..."
"PARIS: I don't know the rules. Obviously, the clothes have to come off for the actual sex part of the evening, but, afterward, what are you supposed to do? I mean nightgowns are obviously out, but wearing nothing seems extreme. And, in case of fire, completely impractical."
"LORELAI: I'm sure."
"PARIS: I wore a camisole one night. It almost strangled me. And I'm definitely not a teddy girl, so what does that leave?"
"LORELAI: Um...t-shirts."
"PARIS: But what does a t-shirt say about me?"
"LORELAI: Well..."
"PARIS: More importantly: what does it say to Doyle about me?"
"LORELAI: Sweetie, it's just a t-shirt. They don't tend to be that chatty."
"PARIS: I don't know. Maybe I should reconsider the ""completely naked"" option. After all, I'm 21. If not now, when? I mean, right now, my ass is probably as good as it's ever going to get. I should exploit that, right?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely! Buy a video camera and go to town."
"PARIS: You know what? I'm starting to fade here."
"LORELAI: Oh, me too. Listen, it's been a terrific lunch..."
"PARIS: I think I'll get another espresso."
"LORELAI: Actually, we're out of espresso."
"PARIS: You are?"
"LORELAI: Yes! Uh...We shut the machine down at three o'clock to give it a rest. 'Cause it's Italian, so it's a little temperamental."
"PARIS: Oh. Okay. Well, then, I guess I should..."
"LORELAI: (cuts Paris off)...Go? Really? Okay. Well, hmm. (she gets up and Paris follows her lead, then Lorelai starts kinda pushing Paris towards the Inn's main entrance) Sweetie, it's been a blast, again."
"PARIS: OK. So, I guess I'll see you Tuesday."
"LORELAI: Yeah, Tuesday. Perfect. Can't wait. Mmmmmkay. (Paris exits the Inn and Lorelai walks away)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, continuous. Michel is standing there doing...well nothing, as Sookie is working and Lorelai walks in)"
"MICHEL: Is she gone?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she's gone."
"MICHEL: Thank God!"
"LORELAI: I can't believe you're in here hiding from a little girl. (walks over to the coffee pot and starts pouring some in a cup)"
"MICHEL: Oh, yes, you can."
"LORELAI: She has a tough exterior, but on the inside Paris is..."
"MICHEL: Tokyo Rose!"
"LORELAI: She's lonely. She does not have a lot of friends."
"SOOKIE: No! Shocker!"
"LORELAI: Sookieeee..."
"SOOKIE: No! No ""Sookie"". She's horrible. I mean, she sends everything back twice, and she makes the waiters write down exactly what she wants me to know is wrong with the food."
"MICHEL: At least you're hidden in here. I'm out there, behind a desk, exposed to all of her elements."
"LORELAI: Michel!"
"MICHEL: She mocked my accent. She called me ""Canadian""."
"SOOKIE: It's enough already. I won't cook for her anymore."
"MICHEL: (distasteful) Lunches."
"SOOKIE: Twice a week for three weeks?"
"MICHEL: They are creepy. The next thing you know, you'll be carrying Emmanuel Lewis around on your shoulders."
"SOOKIE: We don't have time for this, Lorelai. We have a wedding this week. I've got a menu to plan and a cake to design. I don't have time to map out the fish patterns for my wild salmon."
"LORELAI: OK, OK! I'm sorry if she's bothering you guys. I... What can I do? I gave her my cell phone number. I told her to call, I just didn't think she'd use it sooo often."
"SOOKIE: Well, cut it off."
"LORELAI: I feel sorry for her."
"MICHEL: No one likes to be pitied."
"LORELAI: Fine. I have to cut it off. I know. I will."
"MICHEL: Do you promise?"
"LORELAI: I promise."
"SOOKIE: Good! Because I've got a lot of work to do. And we've got a ton of planning to do for this wedding next week, and the menu's a mess, and the cake... (gasps) I was thinking about doing a red velvet cake, but I don't know. And I'm using this wedding as a trial run, so it has to be perfect."
"LORELAI: A trial run for what?"
"SOOKIE: For your wedding."
"LORELAI: oh."
"SOOKIE: Yeah...Which will be when?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: When?"
"LORELAI: When what?"
"SOOKIE: When will you be getting married? I'm gonna need a date."
"LORELAI: we...We haven't set one yet."
"SOOKIE: well...I had Michel black out all of July for next year."
"LORELAI: You what!"
"SOOKIE: I figured you and Luke for an outdoorsy summer wedding."
"LORELAI: Who and Luke?"
"SOOKIE: July 23rd is my pick, but I am flexible."
"LORLAI: Michel, unblack it out."
"MICHEL: I told you."
"LORELAI: ""I told you"" what?"
"MICHEL: I told her that you were not getting married."
"LORELAI: I am getting married."
"SOOKEI: (disappointed and a bit shocked) You were right. You called it."
"MICHEL: The woman can't commit to a purse, much less a man."
"LORELAI: I am getting married."
"SOOKIE: I am so naive. I believed."
"MICHEL: Live and learn."
"LORELAI: Hey! I am getting married. I am. We will set a date. And we will get married on that date. And I've had the same purse for almost a year, thank you very much."
"MICHEL: Of course. My mistake. Now let me go cancel your wedding plans. (exits)"
"LORELAI: (calls after Michel) Those are not my wedding plans. They are Sookie's wedding plans."
"SOOKIE: Well! Fine, then! What are your wedding plans?"
"LORELAI: They haven't been formalized, yet."
"SOOKIE: What does that mean?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, come on! I got men running around my house, a completely destroyed bedroom. Things are crazy right now. When they calm down, and Luke and I get a chance to breathe, we will talk and set the date. Until then, can we drop it, please?"
"SOOKIE: Fine. It's dropped."
"MICHEL: (runs in the kitchen) She's back! She's coming back!"
"SOOKIE: No!"
"LORELAI: Why?!"
"MICHEL: I don't know why. Maybe she left her phone or her spell book. All I knw is she's heading back toward the Inn, and I'm not going out until she leaves."
"LORELAI: Michel, you're being ridiculous. You're a grown man and you have a job to do."
"MICHEL: So do you. And I don't see you rushing out."
"LORELAI: Well, I can't, 'cause I'm not done with my coffee yet. (holds up her cup) Mmm! Good to the last drop."
"(CUT to DAR office, morning. Rory is sitting at her desk typing something oh her PC. The phone rings. Rory picks it up)"
"RORY: Daughters Of The American Revolution. Mrs. Tarkington, yes. I've got your application right here. Sandra Tarkington. Um...I guess we just need to make 100% sure that you're related to a verifiable patriot, because we couldn't substantiate it on our end. Well, see, that's the thing. The fact that you found a musket in your great-uncle's attic doesn't necessarily mean you're related to a revolutionary w*r patriot. Yeah. (Emily comes in the office) Unfortunately. Even if your great-uncle Nate swore on your aunt Kissy's grave that it was so. It's documented genealogy, preferably notarised. Could you hold on for a moment? (Puts the call on hold. To Emily) Psst. Where's Julia?"
"EMILY: Slinked to the back after I tore down Constance's letter."
"RORY: Good, 'cause I've got some gossip."
"EMILY: (sits on a chair. Excited and in a co spiriting manor) My own little Valerie Plame. What's the news?"
"RORY: OK. So, I was at lunch with some of the girls, and I started sniffing around. Just casually asking if anyone had any funny stories about Constance."
"EMILY: You sly fox!"
"RORY: So, one of the girls tells me that about three months ago, she was in the office with Constance, and as Constance was heading out for lunch, she stumbled and dropped her purse, and her altoids box popped open, spilling out enough funny-looking pills to fill a pharmacy. Constance claimed that they were all vitamins. Julia didn't buy it. Because he minute the pills spilled out, Constance threw herself on top of them to cover them up."
"EMILY: A cover-up! That's good! That's what took Nixon down. Oh, this is so exciting! I love having a mole. We should go buy you a trench coat and fedora."
"RORY: I suggested to the girls that next week we invite Constance to lunch. Get a couple drinks in her and see what comes up."
"EMILY: Who knew that behind such a sweet face lurked the soul of a spy?"
"RORY: I prefer the term ""woman of mystery and intrigue"". (cell phone rings) Excuse me. (answers the phone) Hello?"
"PARIS: (on the phone) Rory?"
"RORY: Oh, hey, Paris. (Emily gets up)"
"PARIS: (on the phone) Hey. We need to talk. Is this a bad time? (Emily excuses herself)"
"RORY: (whispering to Emily) Okay. (to Paris on the phone) No, no, now's a fine time. What's up?"
"PARIS: (at the Yale coffee stand. Scene cuts between Paris at Yale, and Rory at the office) Good. This hard-to-reach thing was getting old."
"RORY: I'm all yours, Paris."
"PARIS: I have to put down a security deposit"
"today, by five o'clock, or we lose the place."
"RORY: What place?"
"PARIS: Our place."
"RORY: Our place where?"
"PARIS: Our off-campus place. You're hard to reach in a myriad of ways."
"RORY: Paris, we don't have a place. I'm not moving off campus with you."
"PARIS: Why?"
"RORY: Because I no longer go to campus."
"PARIS: So you're sticking with this ""not going to Yale"" thing of yours?"
"RORY: Yes, I am."
"PARIS: Is this about the boat?"
"RORY: How do you know about the boat?"
"PARIS: Oh, come on. It's out there."
"RORY: Out there? Why is it out there? How is it out there?"
"PARIS: I read about it on Rebecca Thurston's blog."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"PARIS: Dead serious."
"RORY: I thought Rebecca Thurston's blog was just about all the guys she has sex with and how much she hates her mother."
"PARIS: That's true. But the boat you guys stole belongs to Dr. Daniel Zimmerman, whose son is Jason Zimmerman, who Rebecca Thurston had sex with on her father's boat last semester."
"RORY: I can't believe I'm in the blogosphere."
"PARIS: Hey, see for yourself. Just Google ""Rory Gilmore sex boat""."
"RORY: Oh, my god."
"PARIS: Is it true you and Logan tried to outrace the Connecticut coast guard?"
"RORY: Rent the apartment, Paris. I'm not coming back to Yale."
"PARIS: You know, you've put me in a very difficult position. Now what if I end up renting the room to a r*pist or serial k*ll?"
"RORY: I told you over two months ago that I was not coming back. And besides, i think Yale is pretty good about screening for rapists and serial k*ll."
"PARIS: There was no sense of finality in our last conversation."
"RORY: There was a total sense of finality."
"PARIS: Well, you can believe that if you want to, but if I end up on the front page of the Hartford Courier btk'd to death, you'll know why."
"RORY: Goodbye, Paris. (hangs up and sits on her desk. She sighs in frustration)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, night. At the door we see Luke's shape behind the class window, knocking. From inside the house you can hear the laughter of a few men and Lorelai. Nobody is getting the door so Luke helps himself in)"
"LORELAI (OS) : OK guys, let me just get in character here. (the men laugh)"
"LUKE: (while coming in the house) Hello?"
"(CUT to Lorelai's living room, continuous. Luke walks in. Lorelai is apparently entertaining the workers)"
"LORELAI: (in a fake male voice) I will find you, no matter how long, no matter how far! I will find you!"
"LUKE: What the hell's going on here?"
"LORELAI: Hey, Luke. I'm just doing my Daniel Day Lewis retrospective for the guys."
"NORMAN: You should see her rendition of ""My Left Foot"""
"LUKE: Yeah. I've seen it. Thanks."
"LORELAI: No, no! This time, I did it with my right foot. Totally different. Here, I'll show you. (to a worker) Pete hand me the paintbrush."
"LUKE: That's okay. I'm good. Uh, you know, there's a bunch of open paint cans sitting out on the porch."
"LORELAI: Yeah...They'll get to it. We didn't want the pizza to get cold. Hey! Check out this new trick we just taught Paul Anka. Hey, Paul Anka, pizza! (PA barks) Pizza, pizza! (PA barks twice) Salad. (PA doesn't bark. Lorelai and the men laugh. Luke doesn't look impressed) Good boy. Good boy. Oh, sh**t, I'm out of treats. Be right back. (she starts walking to the kitchen. Luke follows her)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, continuous. Tom is sitting at the table looking over some plans and paper work. Luke and Lorelai walk in)"
"LUKE: You know those guys are here to work. You don't have to put a USO show on for them."
"LORELAI: I know. I just want them to have a good time."
"LUKE: Half of them have seen you naked. How much better a time can they have?"
"LORELAI: He's jealous of my popularity, Tom.(gets her purse)"
"TOM: Sure. I get that."
"LUKE: Tom, do other clients feed their construction crews breakfast and lunch and buy them pizza and beer?"
"TOM: Nope."
"LUKE: See."
"TOM: Of course, the naked thing's been done to death."
"LORELAI: All right, Tom. We're outie. Anything we need to discuss before we go?"
"TOM: Nope. We talked about everything but the kitchen."
"LORELAI: What about the kitchen?"
"TOM: Well, do we want to make it bigger?"
"LORELAI: Why would we want to make it bigger?"
"TOM: Well, you might want a nice double oven or a sub-zero freezer. (Lorelai looks unmoved) There's room enough for an island and a cooking station with some stools around it for entertaining.(Lorelai looks a bit scared) You know, for dinner parties. Or maybe you want to cook a big holiday dinner. Thanksgiving or Christmas."
"LORELAI: (to Luke) The strange man is scaring me."
"LUKE: I think the kitchen's fine, Tom. (door opens)"
"TJ: (coming in the house) Okay. Everybody can relax because your trusty contractor has returned. Boy, what a trip. Traffic was terrible. It took me an entire day. Here you go, Tom. (produces a hammer from a paper bag he's holding) The mystic hammer."
"TOM: Thank you, TJ."
"TJ: I gotta tell ya. I don't see what's so special about it. It looks an awful lot like every other hammer we got lying around here.(hands the hammer over to Tom)"
"TOM: (takes the hammer) Well, that's the beauty of the mystic hammer, TJ. It looks the same, but it's completely different."
"LUKE: Tom, make sure those cans are cleaned up out there, OK?"
"LORELAI: Oh, my god with the paint cans already."
"LUKE: I almost tripped over the cans."
"TOM: Don't worry, Luke. I'll take care of it."
"TJ: (as he's inspecting the room, he first notices the door to Rory's room) Hey! (knocks on the door) Did you guys know there was a room back here? (opens the door) Oh, yeah, look at this, a whole room! What a find, huh?"
"LUKE: (closes the door quickly. Lorelai looks uncomfortable) TJ!"
"TJ: Boy, if you knocked out this wall here, opened up this room, you would have a huge kitchen."
"LUKE: Yeah, we don't want a huge kitchen, TJ."
"TJ: Oh, then you could turn it into a weight room, or a workshop...Or, hey, a pork-smoker room. My uncle had a pork-smoker room. Big sides of pork hanging all over the place. We called it the dead-pig room."
"LUKE: TJ, why don't you go out there and tell the guys they can go home."
"TJ: It's not that big a job. I could have it up and running for you in a week. (Luke looks over at Lorelai a bit concerned, Lorelai is still uncomfortable and upset) All I got to do is drive over to Boston for one of those special sledgehammers Tom was telling me about, get a pig, and in about 10 minutes I..."
"LORELAI: (clearly upset) Just leave the room alone, OK! Just...it's fine. Leave it alone. (to Luke) Let's go. (Lorelai and Luke exit from the kitchen door)"
"TJ: (to Tom) Is she Jewish or something?"
"(CUT to a kind of gym or reception hall of some kind, night. Lane's band, Hep Alien, are in towards the end of one of their concerts. They crowd seems to be very into the band's performance. They are dancing and seem to be having a good time. The song the band was playing ends. The audience cheers and applauds)"
"ZACH: Whoo!"
"GIL: YEAH!"
"ZACH: Massachusetts, we love you!"
"GIL: We love you, man!"
"ZACH: We'd like to give some shout-outs before we go. First and foremost, to Pastor Tim. (indicates Pastor Tim who's standing at the side of the hall. Pastor Tim gestures in what he would consider a cool way)"
"GIL: Yeah! Pastor Tim! (Gil plays an honorary riff)"
"ZACH: Thanks for letting us rock the gym here at Whitfield Seventh Day Adventist Church."
"GIL: Got into some very heavy talk with the Pastor about my soul and Ecclesiastes, and stuff, after sound check. And I got to say, if Christ comes back in fulfilment of prophecy, he's gonna be hooking up with you first, dude, 'cause you are awesome.(the crowd cheers and applauds. Pastor Tim looks a bit embarrassed but pleased)"
"ZACH: We would like to also thank the decoration committee, for making the AV Room look so cool. (as Lane gets up from her stool and comes to the front of the stage the crowd cheers and applauds)"
"GIL: Yeah! I've played the Whiskey before, man, and it's got a similar vibe. It does!"
"ZACH: But most important, we'd like to thank all of you for coming out to see us, letting us into your homes, and making us feel so welcome.(the crows cheers again) We got to go!"
"GIL: We are going home, people!"
"ZACH: There are some t-shirts and stuff for sale on the table over there. We are zach, Gil, Brian, and Lane, and we are Hep Alien, and we are out of here! (they give the audience a bow, and they get one last cheer and a round of applause. The crowd starts scattering as Zach turns to Lane) We were so on, man."
"LANE: We were beyond on. We were...ohh!(gives Zach a kiss)"
"ZACH: Cool."
"GIL: Watch it, Lane. The Pastor's still hanging."
"BRIAN: We were as tight as the Foo Fighters."
"GIL: Tighter. Listen, if that pretentious little snot in Coldplay can walk around comparing himself to Bono, we can compare ourselves to the Foo Fighters."
"LANE: I'm exhausted but exhilarated, you know. I'm not gonna sleep for months."
"ZACH: (excited) Oh, cool! There's people buying t-shirts. We can get some food tonight."
"GIL: Just leave money for gas."
"LANE: We'll have money for gas, guys. Don't worry. Let's just drink this in. The last night of our first tour."
"BRIAN: I can't believe it's over."
"ZACH: I can't believe we survived. (Pastor Tim approaches the stage and calls Gil. he whispers something in his ear)"
"GIL: You got it, Pastor Tim. (to the rest of the band) We got to break it down, guys. They want to start setting up for bible study, tomorrow, and they need the stage for their big crucifix.(the band starts gathering their stuff. Lane looks very happy)"

"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, morning. Sookie is hiding something tall from Lorelai with some steel trays)"
"SOOKIE: Okay, here we go. (excited) Aah! (reaveals a very nice chocolate wedding cake)"
"LORELAI: Oooh! What is that? And where can I get one?"
"SOOKIE: That is my dark chocolate s'mores wedding cake."
"LORELAI: You've been reading my diary."
"SOOKIE: I got the idea in a dream. I was back in cooking school and late for my final, and I run over to an oven, and I open it, and sitting there is the s'mores wedding cake. And I present it to my teacher, he starts weeping, and the whole class is applauding and cheering."
"LORELAI: That's so nice."
"SOOKIE: Yeah! And then of course Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise come leaping out of the cake, screaming about how amazing it is. So that made the whole thing a little creepy, but up until then..."
"LORELAI: Look, you've got a marshmallow bride and groom on the top!"
"SOOKIE: You think they'll like it?"
"LORELAI: I do."
"SOOKIE: You think you'll like it?"
"LORELAI: Look, captain Ahab..."
"SOOKIE: Come on, set the date."
"LORELAI: I will!"
"SOOKIE: Is there something you're not telling me? Because agreeing to marry somebody is just as big a commitment as actually marrying them. So don't think it's not."
"LORELAI: I am committed. And you should be. So..."
"SOOKIE: This isn't a joking matter, missy. I want your wedding to be perfect, or I want nothing to do with it."
"LORELAI: (mock disappointment) Oh, really? Wow. That might be a problem. Cause I was really hoping for one of those disastrous weddings where we lose both rings minutes before the ceremony and I get a nosebleed as I'm walking down the aisle. And then, later, at the reception, Luke is found in the coat-check room Jude Law-ing it with one of the bridesmaids."
"MICHEL: (walks in the kitchen) Hey. I just received a call that the wedding party will not be getting in until midnight, and someone will need to be here to greet them. I would do it, but I don't want to."
"LORELAI: All right, I'll do it."
"MICHEL: Very well. I'll leave the...wait. Do you feel that?"
"LORELAI: Feel what?"
"MICHEL: An icy chill as if something sinister is approaching."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"MICHEL: (hums the witch's theme from ""The Wizard Of Oz"") Ta-ta-ra-ta-ra-ra-Taraaaaaa"
"LORELAI: Gee, Michel, is Paris here?"
"MICHEL: Maybe she was coming up the walk when I fled. (starts walking away)"
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"MICHEL: In the opposite direction.(exits trough the kitchen door)"
"SOOKIE: Paris? Paris is here? (at Michel who has already left) Oh! I get the humming now!(chuckles. Puts on a serious face and turns to Lorelai) What is she doing here?"
"LORELAI: We're having lunch."
"SOOKIE: Really? Ordering pizza are ya?"
"LORELAI: No, Sookie. I'm breaking up with her today, all right? I'm ending it, like I promised, so back off."
"SOOKIE: Grilled chicken and fries. That is all I'm making.(walks over to the fridge)"
"LORELAI: Thank you. (the kitchen staff walk in quickly telling each other to hurry up and move along in hushed voices) Apparently, the eagle has landed.(exits)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly's dining hall, continuous. Lorelai walks in and approaches Paris who is waiting for her)"
"LORELAI: Paris, hi. Good to see you. You look good. Something different? (they hug)"
"PARIS: I accidentally sprayed gasoline on myself at the service station."
"LORELAI: Well that must be it. Come on, let's sit. (they sit at a table)"
"PARIS: Sorry I'm late, I was interviewing roommates. And all I can say is build an ark, 'cause it is seriously time for a flood."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, you want some iced tea?(gestures to a waiter)"
"PARIS: I mean, forget the concept of intelligence or even the simple act of carrying on a conversation. (waiter comes over and starts filling glasses of iced tea for them) These people can't type a reference sheet. I mean they all have questionable morals, a complete distrust of soap products...(to waiter who's pouring her ice tea) in the glass, out of the glass. It's all semantics to you, right?"
"LORELAI: (excuses the waiter) Oh...well, I'm sure you'll find someone. You just have to keep looking."
"PARIS: I guess. It's just, classes start next week, and things are already getting crazy."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Boy. You sound really busy, Paris."
"PARIS: I am."
"LORELAI: You know, I feel a little bad, dragging you all the way out here when you have so much on your plate. I mean, talk about self-centred, huh? Think about someone else for a change, Lorelai."
"PARIS: Oh, that's okay."
"LORELAI: You know, I'll be totally fine if you need to cut back on our lunches."
"PARIS: Cut back?"
"LORELAI: Cut back, cut out. Whatever you need, is fine with me."
"PARIS: You know, this all sucks. I wouldn't be in this position if it weren't for Rory. She was supposed to room with me. It was all planned out. I even called her yesterday and gave her one more chance to change her mind, but no."
"LORELAI: You talked to Rory yesterday?"
"PARIS: Yeah, I called her at the office."
"LORELAI: (surprised) Office? What office?"
"PARIS: Her office."
"LORELAI: She has an office. What is she doing?"
"PARIS: I don't know...Her job."
"LORELAI: What job?"
"PARIS: Some job in an office with her grandmother."
"LORELAI: Well, her grandmother does not have an office."
"PARIS: Well, that's where I called her."
"LORELAI: This makes no sense to me at all. What did it sound like?"
"PARIS: An office."
"LORELAI: Yes, I know an office, but were there specific office sounds?"
"PARIS: I think I heard a fax machine."
"LORELAI: A fax machine? Are you sure it was a fax machine?"
"PARIS: Pretty sure."
"LORELAI: Well, were there people talking or traffic? Did you hear traffic, cause that could give us a location. (Paris looks at Lorelai suspiciously) City, the county or...what?"
"PARIS: So that's what this is all about. You're just using me to get to Rory?"
"LORELAI: Aw, Paris."
"PARIS: You're pumping me full of espresso and pumping me for information."
"LORELAI: No, that is not true. I'm not pumping. No pumping. We're completely pump-free."
"PARIS: I'm so stupid. I mean why else would you want to have biweekly lunches with me?"
"LORELAI: There are many, many reasons. And they will come to me just in a second."
"PARIS: I'm blind. I walk blindly through life."
"LORELAI: No. Now, you're not blind."
"PARIS: I'll leave. I'll go right now. (gets up)"
"LORELAI: Oh, Paris, please. (stops her from leaving) I'm sorry. You mentioned Rory, and a thing went off in my brain. It's just a mother thing. But I love our lunches. I really do. Please stay."
"PARIS: Are you sure? Because I could just..."
"LORELAI: Yes. I'm completely positive. Everything's good. Now, won't you sit down? (Paris sits back on her chair) How does chicken sound, OK?"
"PARIS: OK. Just not too dry."
"LORELAI: OK.(sighs)"
"PARIS: (looks around as no waiter is approaching them) The service here sucks."
"(CUT to nursing home, afternoon. A few people from the nursing home are dancing around to some jazz playing from a vinyl record. Rory is supervising, apparently doing some of her Community Service)"
"RORY: (to a couple dancing) Very smooth, Mr. Hollister."
"Mr HOLLISTER: That was the Susy-Q right into the Shorty George."
"RORY: I thought it looked familiar."
"Mr HOLLISTER: And after this song, I'll take you for a twirl."
"RORY: Oh, I hope I can keep up. (to another couple) Watch those hands, Mr. Fink. (the record starts skipping) I'm on it. (fixes the problem. To couples dancing) You know, I can get this for you guys on CD. (the elders laugh) Oh, now, come on. It wasn't that funny. (notices someone at the door. It's Logan) Oh, my god. Hey, stranger! (walks over to him)"
"LOGAN: And hello to you. (they kiss)"
"Mr FINK: Watch those hands, Miss Gilmore."
"RORY: Touche, Mr. Fink. (to Logan) What are you doing here?"
"LOGAN: Well, I was in Copenhagen this morning, and then I remembered I've a four o'clock Mambo class."
"RORY: I'm so glad you're back. How was Europe?"
"LOGAN: Same as it was last year."
"RORY: (noticing a bandage on Logan's finger) What did you do?"
"LOGAN: Long, embarrassing story. I'll tell you later."
"RORY: OK. Oh, wait. Hold on. (stops the record player and addresses the elders) Okay, everyone. It is time for cake and punch. (a nursing home worker comes in with a trolley. The elders groan a bit) It's only a 15-minute break, and then it's back to the dance floor."
"LOGAN: So you're Arthur Murray now?"
"RORY: No, I don't have that much training. Their dance teacher has an inner-ear infection. I'm just filling in. My job is to make sure nobody falls down."
"LOGAN: Aaand, what if somebody does?"
"RORY: That's what the panic button is for. (indicating a red button on the wall)"
"LOGAN: (laughing) So, when does this crazy rock 'n' roll party wrap up?"
"RORY: Another 45 minutes. But if you get yourself some cake and punch, it'll only seem like 40. (they kiss) I missed you."
"LOGAN: That was my plan.(Rory chuckles as Logan walks away, and then changes a record on the player)"
"(CUT to pool house, night. Rory walks to the couch, from the kitchen bringing Logan a glass of...something wearing Logan's shirt. Logan is sitting on the couch covered up in a comforter. She gives him the glass)"
"LOGAN: Thank you. (takes the glass from her)"
"RORY: You're welcome.(settles down on the couch and covers herself with another comforter) I missed this."
"LOGAN: Me too."
"RORY: Oh, so you, Colin, and Finn didn't do a lot of cuddling in Europe?"
"LOGAN: Nah, mostly just hand-holding."
"RORY: So is there any official record of this trip, or was all evidence confiscated at the airport?"
"LOGAN: I got pictures."
"RORY: Yeah? Can I see?"
"LOGAN: (point to his bag) Hand me that. (puts the glass down as Rory reaches for the bag and gives it to him)"
"Now, you realize if I show you mine, you have to show me yours.(gets his cell phone out of the bag)"
"RORY: You saw mine about five minutes ago, mister."
"LOGAN: Oh, I hate it when you work blue. (fiddling with his phone) Okay. Here's Colin sleeping on the train."
"RORY: Uh huh..."
"LOGAN: And here's Finn shoving carrot sticks up Colin's nose as Colin sleeps on the train."
"RORY: Very mature."
"LOGAN: We try. This is Gloucestershire, England..."
"RORY: It's pretty."
"LOGAN: ...where we attended the famous Gloucestershire Cheese-Rolling festival, a time-honoured tradition where brave men, such as myself, climb to the top of a hill with a large wheel of cheese, then proceed push it and run after it as it rolls all the way down."
"RORY: Shut up. Why would you commit that to film? (takes the phone from Logan)"
"LOGAN: That's me, that's Colin, that's Finn, and that is the cheese."
"RORY: So if you b*at your cheese to the bottom of the hill, are you disqualified, or do you win?"
"LOGAN: There are no winners or losers in the Gloucestershire Cheese-Rolling festival."
"RORY: Well there certainly aren't any winners."
"LOGAN: Tell me about it. (indicating his bandaged finger)"
"RORY: Who's that?"
"LOGAN: Ah! Now that's the love of Colin's life."
"RORY: Colin fell in love?"
"LOGAN: Yeah. He met her in Holland and she doesn't speak a word of English, so she has no idea how incredibly annoying she finds him."
"RORY: What's with the outfit?"
"LOGAN: She's a milkmaid."
"RORY: Stop!"
"LOGAN: She has cows. She has pails."
"RORY: (amused) Colin fell in love with a milkmaid?"
"LOGAN: It's pretty serious, too. He ditched us and followed her to Amsterdam, where they've been hold up ever since. We haven't heard a word from him. I mean we assume he's gonna be back by the time...(sighs)"
"RORY: By the time what? By the time the cows come home? What? By the time school starts? (Logan sighs again) What? What's the matter?"
"LOGAN: Nothing."
"RORY: Logan, you can mention school to me."
"LOGAN: I don't want to bum you out."
"RORY: Logan! That is ridiculous! I'm fine. I mean...Look. Yale was a wonderful chapter in my life, but I've moved on. I have my work. I have my new pad. I'm just really happy with where I am right now."
"LOGAN: (disbelief) Really?"
"RORY: Logan, you don't have to feel weird about this. You go to Yale. Your friends go to Yale. How can we not talk about Yale?"
"LOGAN: I don't know."
"RORY: Exactly. So, we both agree that the topic of Yale can never be off-limits."
"LOGAN: OK, fine. Well if you're so cool with it, then why don't you come meet me at Yale tomorrow and I can show you my new apartment and maybe take you to lunch?"
"RORY: I can't tomorrow because I have my DAR induction luncheon."
"LOGAN: Well, then, how about breakfast?"
"RORY: Breakfast sounds good."
"LOGAN: I have to say, Ace, I like the new digs."
"RORY: Yeah, it's really nice, huh? You haven't even seen the bedroom yet."
"LOGAN: Wow!"
"RORY: What?"
"LOGAN: OK, fine! but don't think that this is gonna work a second time. (get's up from the couch and starts moving towards the bedroom)"
"RORY: (comprehension dawning on her) Oh, no, Logan, I didn't mean...No, I seriously meant that you hadn't seen the bedroom yet."
"LOGAN: You're making me feel cheap, Ace. (keeps walking to the bedroom)"
"RORY: Logan! I swear, I wasn't working blue. (gets up and follows Logan)"
"(CUT to gas station, night. Gil is pumping the van with gas. The rest of the band seem uncomfortable squashed in the small cabin, the boys are sitting in the back with all the equipment and lane is g*n)"
"BRIAN: Come on, let's go!"
"GIL: Martha's thirsty, guys."
"ZACH: I hate that he named the van."
"LANE: I think it's cute."
"ZACH: Hey! You're not pumping premium, right?"
"GIL: It's the cheap stuff, bro. Don't worry."
"ZACH: Yeah, well you said that before, and you pumped premium, and it meant no snack stop in Philadelphia."
"GIL: Whoa ho ho!"
"LANE: What, Gil?"
"GIL: Well I was just watching the numbers spin by on the gas pump dial thingy here getting bigger and bigger. And I was thinking...what if that was counting all the people who were, like, dying, you know, so it's all these dead dudes spinning by?"
"ZACH: Every day with him is like being on ""meet the press."""
"BRIAN: I can't feel my legs."
"ZACH: Move around a little."
"BRIAN: Your amp's on my foot."
"ZACH: Look, I'm no better off than you are, Brian. My guitar case is jammed against my thigh."
"BRIAN: I got a cymbal stand sticking in my pancreas."
"LANE: Guys, we are an hour out of Stars Hollow. Hang in there."
"ZACH: God, the smell of that gas is making me hungry."
"LANE: Gil, hurry!"
"GIL: I'm coming. (closes the vans door and starts walking to the drivers seat) All right. It's the last of the gas money, so this better get us home. (gets in and starts up the van) Everybody: Lean Forward. (they all lean forward and the van drives off)"
"(CUT to van, continuous. They are driving on the highway)"
"LANE: Gil, where'd you put the map?"
"GIL: It's...(does a dismissive gesture) Ugh."
"LANE: You're okay to drive, right?"
"GIL: Yeah, sure. I'm just..."
"ZACH: Dude, don't do that thing where you don't finish your sentences. It freaks me out."
"GIL: I'll try. I'm just...ugh."
"ZACH: (shoves Gil) Come on."
"GIL: I guess I'm just weak from hunger. The guy I got gas from, I was talking to him, and he suddenly turned into a giant turkey leg."
"BRIAN: Please don't mention food."
"LANE: Let's think good thoughts here, guys. Picture yourself at home, okay? Home at last. What's the first thing you're gonna do?"
"ZACH: Eat."
"GIL: Wash my hair. Hug the kids, set them up in front of a ""Harry Potter"" movie, and then do my wife for, like, an hour."
"LANE: Uh, look, guys, I've got an announcement. Kind of in my capacity as band manager, and I think it's gonna cheer you up, a lot."
"ZACH: What?"
"LANE: Well, as you know, each gig paid us a little something, and we stayed free at people's houses along the way, and we sold a decent amount of t-shirts, so, besides food, which we consumed in moderation, there were days that we spent practically nothing."
"ZACH: Yeah?"
"LANE: Well...I wanted us to come out of this tour with something. So I figured the best way to motivate us, to save, would be to fib a little on how much we had."
"GIL: You fibbed a little?"
"LANE: Actually, a lot. But it paid off big, guys, because we're going home with over $9,000. (they guys look up at Lane in disbelief and a bit pissed) Huh? $9,000, American dollars. Why aren't you guys jumping up and down?"
"BRIAN: Besides the fact that my spinal cord severed somewhere back on the 95?"
"ZACH: And that we haven't eaten a full meal in over two months?"
"GIL: I thought we were broke."
"LANE: See? See how it worked? And now we're reaping the rewards."
"ZACH: Lane, we were starving."
"BRIAN: We scrimped on everything. I stopped brushing my teeth because I couldn't buy toothpaste."
"GIL: I've been washing my hair with bar soap."
"LANE: But think about what we can do with the money. We can record. Make a CD. Nirvana made ""Bleach"" for $600. Even factoring in inflation, if we're on our game, we could make ""Bleach"", 10 times over."
"BRIAN: Our own ""Bleach""."
"ZACH: It would be very cool to record."
"BRIAN: Very cool."
"GIL: I think..."
"ZACH: Dude, come on. (shoves Gil again) You gotta finish that sentence."
"GIL: I can't talk and drive."
"LANE: Then just drive, Gil. 30 miles. 30 miles to home. (they high five)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's driveway, night. The crew is still working. Lorelai gets out of her car and starts walking towards Luke and Tom)"
"LORELAI: Talking about how pretty I am again? Oh, get a new subject, boys."
"LUKE: What are you doing home?"
"LORELAI: Well, I have to be at the Inn late tonight. So I thought I'd come and feed Paul Anka, take him for a little walk, work out our crosswalk issues."
"LUKE: Well, Tom here was just tel..."
"TOM: (cuts Luke off)...it's not my fault."
"LUKE: I wasn't gonna say it was your fault."
"TOM: You've got ""it's Tom's fault"" tone in your voice."
"LUKE: He's got to shut your water off for a couple of days."
"TOM: We hit a pipe that shouldn?t have been hit."
"LORELAI: (accusingly) Tom!"
"TOM: See how fast the ""it's Tom's fault"" tone has spread?"
"LUKE: You can stay with me."
"LORELAI: OK. Well, I got to get back to work. That wedding party's coming in tonight."
"LUKE: Oh, I'll gather up some of your stuff."
"LORELAI: Last time you gathered up some of my stuff, you accidentally brought me four bras and no pants."
"LUKE: That could have been intentional."
"LORELAI: I will get my own stuff, thank you. (starts walking to the house, but backtracks) Wooo, now I just have to figure out what to do with Paul Anka. You know, I've never left him alone so late before, and he might start doing that howling thing the neighbours are so fond of. But...well, that's okay. So...Oh! You know, I guess I could just leave him here and I can come back and get him after work, which will be, oh! two, three, four in the morning. Boy. Late. (looks for a reaction from Luke. He seems to not be getting the hint) Or I could drop him off at a kennel for a few hours. I know there's a good one in Woodbridge, 20 miles away. Of course, I'd have to leave now and pick up some dilithium crystals on the way to fix the warp drive in my jeep so that I could drive there and back in time to meet the wedding party back at the Inn, but that's doable. (looking at Luke for yet another reaction. He still looks unmoved) Yeah...and then, of course, by the time I get off work and drive all the way back ther"
"LUKE: (amused) I just wanted to see how long you'd go on."
"LORELAI: Well, you know my babbling capabilities are infinite."
"LUKE: I'll take the dog home with me. And points for the dilithium-crystal reference."
"LORELAI: Well, when you sleep with geeks...(TJ approaches them with a bunch of paper lunch bags)"
"TJ: Hey. I just talked to my buddy, Tony Benzino, who's a contractor over in Hartford, and he says contractors don't fetch lunches for the crew. They do, however, get to answer the phone, and they do get to sign for things and order things, and Tom, there is no such thing as a mystic hammer. And after this very enlightening conversation, you know what I'm starting to think?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"TJ: I'm starting to think that I'm not really the contractor on this job."
"LUKE: Look, TJ..."
"TOM: It's okay, Luke. I got this. TJ, we did this for your own good. We got you out of the house. You got paid. You didn't get hurt. Look at it that way."
"TJ: Oh, yeah? Is that the way I'm supposed to look at it? Well, fine! (starts handing out the bags) You can keep your stupid phony contracting job. I'm through playing your patsy. I'm through running your errands. Hold on. That's no mayo. (trades some bags he's already handed out) Here, Ed. I'm done! I quit! You can all kiss any part of me that reaches your general vicinity first. You have seen the last of me. So arrivederci, Roma! (starts walking away but walks back up to them) And to repay you all for this lousy trick that you played on me, you can all reach in here and grab your own damn condiments. (drops the last bag and walks away)"
"TOM: That's dinner!"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, night. TJ is sitting on a stool at the counter, he has an empty milkshake glass in front of him)"
"TJ: (pushes the glass across the counter) Hit me."
"LUKE: (walks up to TJ) That's your fourth milkshake, TJ."
"TJ: Doesn't matter, Luke. It's not like I got anywhere to go tomorrow."
"LUKE: So, you're not a contractor. Who cares? Neither am I. You don't see me crying about it."
"TJ: I'm not crying about it...anymore."
"LUKE: It's not your thing."
"TJ: Yeah. Not my thing. I don't have a thing. I have nothing."
"LUKE: You've got Liz. You've got your health."
"TJ: I've got no dream. I've got no future."
"LUKE: What are you talking about, you got no future? (walks over and point to the shelves TJ put up for him) Did you or did you not build these shelves?"
"TJ: I did."
"LUKE: Those are great shelves, TJ."
"TJ: Stop it."
"LUKE: They are! There's some real craftsmanship that went into those shelves. Well made, you got some nice carved detail. That's a quality piece of merchandise, and you made it."
"TJ: Yeah...So?"
"LUKE: So you should be proud of that. Not everybody can do that. So you're not a contractor. You're a craftsman!"
"TJ: Wow. I'm a craftsman...Like Jesus. He built stuff for a while."
"LUKE: Yeah! You're exactly like Jesus. That was my point."
"TJ: Yeah. What am I getting so mopey about? I mean,I build shelves. I'm a craftsman who builds shelves, like Jesus. (get up from his stool and Luke starts walking him to the diner door) And plus my day rate has just gone way up."
"LUKE: Yeah, but TJ that was a contractor's rate you were being paid, not a shelfmaker's rate."
"TJ: Yeah, but I wasn't really the contractor."
"LUKE: I know, but that was...Have a good night, TJ.(opens the diner door and TJ exits)"
"(CUT to Luke's apartment, night. PA is lying on the floor. Luke walks in)"
"LUKE: Hey! Just lying there. What a surprise! Make sure you grind that smelly butt of yours into the rug real good. Get that aroma really locked in those fibbers there. (sees that PA has gone through the garbage) Oh, man. Wow, you are fun to have around. (he notices some chocolate wrapping paper) Oh, no. Oh, crap. Oh, god. (takes his watch off) Tell me you didn't. Tell me you didn't. There we go.(sniffs PA's breath) Oh, jeez! (picks PA up and starts running out of the apartment)"
"(CUT to Stars Hollow streets, continuous. Luke is running, with PA in his arms, up a street and enters a house. He starts to knock on the door franticly)"
"LUKE: Come on! Hey! Wake up! I got a dog out here! (the light in the house come on)"
"VET: (opens the door) Can I help you?"
"LUKE: The dog ate chocolate. And I don't know a lot about dogs, but I do know they shouldn't eat chocolate, and I went to the animal hospital, and they were closed, and I called Babette and she told me where you lived, and you got to do something. Because this is not my dog. This is my fiance's dog. She loves him. She named him ""Paul Anka"", which may, on the surface, not seem like a sign of love, but if you knew her, you'd get it, and believe me there's a lot of ways I could screw up, but I cannot lose her over the fact I k*ll her dog."
"VET: I'll get the ipecac. Come on in. (they walk in the house)"
"(CUT to restaurant, morning. Rory and Logan are having breakfast)"
"RORY: So, I tell the guy, ""Hey! There is no way all these potatoes could have been peeled if I had waltzed in here at twelve"". He simply refused to believe me or credit me with the hours, so finally I just said, ""You know what? There is another soup kitchen down on Hadley, and they serve more vegetables than you do, so I would rather work there anyhow"", and I turned in my apron, and I walked out."
"LOGAN: Wow. Rough world, the world of Community Service."
"RORY: Oh, you don't know the half of it. I've done 125 hours, so I've got 175 to go, which is a little off my goal, but not by much, so I can deal. I've got the candy-striper thing starting next week. I didn't really want that, but I had to take it, because I was supposed to get on the zoo b*at, which would have been gross but great cause they'll let you do a double shift. (Logan looks at his watch) But they're always full. Weird, huh?"
"LOGAN: Very weird."
"RORY: I'm boring you."
"LOGAN: Far from it. I just have to go. I have to meet with my faculty adviser and convince her that this is the year I'm finally gonna make something of myself."
"RORY: Well, don't tell her about that cheese-rolling incident. She'll never believe you."
"LOGAN: You want me to walk you back to your car?"
"RORY: No, I think I can make it by myself."
"LOGAN: (gets up to leave) OK."
"RORY: OK. (Logan kisses her cheek)"
"LOGAN: I'll call you later?"
"RORY: OK. (Logan leaves)"
"(CUT to Luke's apartment, morning. Camera pans from PA, who's lying next to the bed, to Lorelai and Luke who are sleeping. Luke wakes up, gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen. Lorelai wakes up too and notices Luke in the kitchen drinking water)"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. Go back to sleep. (starts walking back towards the bed)"
"LORELAI: No, it's okay. I like to watch you hydrate."
"LUKE: Oh, man. When did you get home? I didn't hear you come in."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you were conked out pretty good."
"LUKE: Oh yeah!"
"LORELAI: Both of you. (sits up bit better in bed as Luke comes closer)"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: How did it go with Paul Anka last night?"
"LUKE: Well, first off, he ate three pounds of unsweetened baking chocolate, so I had to rush him to the vet, to his house because the animal hospital was closed, and he forced some sort of vomit-inducing medicine down Paul Anka's throat, and then Paul Anka proceeded to throw up for the next hour and a half. (Lorelai looks concerned) After that I sat with him for another three hours, holding a bowl of water under his nose to make sure that he was re-hydrating properly, and then I chocolate-proofed the apartment and the diner to make sure that never happens again. (Lorelai looks at Luke lovingly) And now I'm gonna go downstairs and make Paul Anka some scrambled eggs because the vet said that the kibble is gonna be a little hard on his stomach for a couple of days. Does he have any particular fear of cheddar? Cause I thought I'd throw that in to make it taste better."
"LORELAI: Luke?"
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: I don't want to set a wedding date until things are right with Rory."
"LUKE: OK. (Lorelai looks relieved) So, the cheddar is...?"
"LORELAI: OK. (Luke walks away and Lorelai settles back in bed)"
"(CUT to Yale, morning. It's the freshmen orientation)"
"FRESHMAN COUNSELLOR: The dining-hall hours are cast in stone. You snooze, you lose. And your school-issued IDs are your new best friends. Become inseparable. You'll be asked for it constantly, so give it a nickname and learn to commit. It operates the laundry room. It is your meal card. Every new student at Yale will learn the value of the ID."
"(Camera pans to Rory as the new students walk by. She looks around longingly. The scene starts to fade on Rory's face and we see a new Rory in a tweed suit at her DAR induction luncheon. Emily is giving a welcome speech for the new members)"
"EMILY: Every new member of the DAR Will feel instantly the sense of camaraderie that has become synonymous with the DAR. As certified members of the Hartford chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, you will hold a very special and esteemed place in this community. But with that great esteem comes great responsibility: to your chapter, to your town, and to your nation. This is a proud moment for me as I, your president, welcome the new members of the Daughters of the American Revolution."

"(OPEN in Lorelai's house, night. Lorelai is going through some boxes filled with tapes and clearing them out)"
"LUKE: (OS) Oh, now come on. Come on! You have got to be kidding me."
"LORELAI: Luke, come down here."
"LUKE: (OS) This baseboard's not level. I can tell just by looking at it."
"LORELAI: Tom told you. It's a work in progress."
"LUKE: It's a disaster in progress. This baseboard belongs in a fun house."
"LORELAI: Luke, going up there is like busting into an operating room in the middle of a heart transplant. You know, and getting mad at the surgeon because the guy's heart is on the outside. And you're like, ""Hey, his heart should be in his chest"", and the surgeon's like, ""Dude, I'm not done yet, get out of the operating room""."
"LUKE: I've got to check the bathroom fixtures."
"LORELAI: Hey...uh, help. Fire, fire. We're on fire down here. Help. Flames crackling, marshmallows toasting. Save us."
"LUKE: (comes down from upstairs) What are you doing yelling ""fire""? You can't do that."
"LORELAI: No, that only pertains to movie theatres. Crowded ones. If you're watching a Wednesday matinee of ""Deuce Bigalow,"" you can yell ""fire"" all you want. Hell, you can start a fire, and no one will complain."
"LUKE: So, how is your project going?"
"LORELAI: Like gangbusters."
"LUKE: Looks like it. You're getting rid of a ton. (picks up a box full of tapes)"
"LORELAI: (stops him from picking up the box) Oh! No, no. Whoa, whoa, there, mister. Huh! Those are the keepers. These are the ones I'm tossing. (picks up another box that looks very light)"
"LUKE: There's two videotapes in there."
"LORELAI: Every journey begins with a single step."
"LUKE: This was your idea, remember. Use the remodel to purge yourself of useless stuff."
"LORELAI: Yeah, useless. I'm keeping what I need."
"LUKE: (picks up a tape) You need an episode of ""Magnum PI"", from 1986?"
"LORELAI: Of course not. That tape is mislabelled. That's ""A Knots Landing"" from 1981. All the women are held hostage at g*n during Ginger's baby shower, classic."
"LUKE: (pick up a bunch of tapes tied together) ""21 Jump Street"", season one. You do not need this."
"LORELAI: I need my ""Jump Street."""
"LUKE: So buy the DVDs. It'll save you a ton of space."
"LORELAI: No. The DVDs won't have the commercials on them. The original commercials, which is half the fun. Spuds Mackenzie, Clara Peller, ""nothing comes between me and my calvins"". I mean, they don't make them like that anymore. (walks over to another box)"
"LUKE: You're gonna be one of those weird old people who hoards empty film canisters and laundry measuring scoops."
"LORELAI: Uh, gonna be. (picks up a tape) Hey, I've been looking for this. Check it out."
"LUKE: (reading the label on the tape) ""Riding The Bus With My Sister."""
"LORELAI: Rosie O'Donnell plays a retarded woman who's obsessed with riding the bus, and Andie McDowell is her uptight, big-city sister."
"LUKE: Sister?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, and it gets better. In the ads I saw, the Rosie character was calling herself the sheriff, and she was bragging about her sex life and buying toilet seats. And Angelica Huston directed it. Maerose directed it."
"LUKE: OK, fine. Watch it tonight after I leave. Then you can dump it tomorrow."
"LORELAI: You kidding? You don't just sit down and watch a movie like this. This is a Friday-night special. I'd have to have takeout, pizza, red vines, mallomars, the works. Plus, there's no way I would watch this by myself. This is exactly the kind of movie I would watch with someone. Someone else, you know? (looks at the tape she's still holding)"
"LUKE: Yeah, right. (changes the subject) Well, at least try to pare this box down a little, please?"
"LORELAI: I'll try. I will. I promise."
"LUKE: Good. (starts walking towards the staircase)"
"LORELAI: If you promise not to go upstairs again."
"LUKE: I just got to check on one thing. (stops at the bottom of the staircase)"
"LORELAI: (picks up a tape) Oh, look at that! ""America's Castles"", the special Florida edition. Seen it five times, keeping it. (puts the tape in the keepers box)"
"LUKE: One thing."
"LORELAI: (picks up another tape) Oh, ""The History Of Paper"", a documentary by Ted Burns, distant relative of Ken Burns. Oh, seven hours. Dull, dull, dull. Keeping it! (puts it in the keepers box)"
"LUKE: I'm not going up. (retreats from the staircase)"
"LORELAI: Good. Oh! ""Please Don't Eat The Daisies,"" seasons two and four. I've been looking for this."
"(OPENING CREDITS)"
"(CUT to pool house bedroom, morning. Rory is getting ready. There is a knock on the door and Rory answers it)"
"RORY: Come in."
"MAID: (enters with a clothes rack and head for the closet) Good morning, Miss Gilmore."
"RORY: Good morning. (surprised) Oh, wow, need help?"
"MAID: No, thank you."
"RORY: What's that for?"
"MAID: Mrs. Gilmore instructed me to help you with your summer things."
"RORY: My summer things?"
"MAID: Mrs Gilmore says that autumn is the time for sweaters and wool, not for sundresses and flipper-floppers."
"RORY: Oh. Well, I don't really dress seasonally. I just sort of go with the flow."
"MAID: That is what Mrs Gilmore would like to correct."
"RORY: Oh, well... (cell phone starts ringing and Rory answers it) Hello?"
"EMILY: (on the phone) Hello, Rory, it's your Grandmother."
"RORY: Grandma, we were just talking about you. (that maid starts filling up the rack, and Rory looks shocked) How are you? How's Helsinki?"
"EMILY: Cold, unaccommodating, a population of walking dead."
"RORY: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. (puts the speaker on, walks towards the rack and starts going through the clothes that maid has already hung)"
"EMILY: The cab driver from the airport was a thief, and the cuisine isn't fit for a stray cat. Kippers and cabbage rolls. And the weather! It snowed 6 feet last night, and apparently they can't fly under those conditions. Can't or won't, it's hard to say. I defy you to read a Finn."
"RORY: (picking up a few hangers from the rack) Yeah, they can be pretty stoic in those northern climes. (to maid as Emily keeps talking) Excuse me, but I actually use a lot of this in autumn. You know, light layers. (the maid smiles politely and continues to do her job)"
"Emily: ...Anyway, your Grandfather and I are going to be delayed a couple of days."
"RORY: (a bit distracted) I'm sorry. That stinks."
"EMILY: I'm in a real bind. I've got that mixer with the girls I'm hosting tomorrow. With the curators of the Gilbert Stuart Exhibit?"
"RORY: (distracted) Oh right. (Rory picks out a dress and addresses the maid again as Emily keeps talking) I wear it with tights."
"EMILY: I've planning it for weeks. Everybody's counting on me. But here I am thousands of miles away, stuck in a land of reindeer stew. And I'm loathe to cancel because there's nothing Constance Betterton would like more than for me to slip up so she can destroy my reputation, run me out of the DAR, Then jump in the air like a cheerleader and land doing the splits."
"RORY: (obviously not paying any real attention) Uh, wow. That's...the splits, huh? Um, whatever I can do to help, Grandma. (to maid) I wear white after Labor Day."
"EMILY: Rory?"
"RORY: (to maid) I'm a rebel. Just go with it."
"EMILY: Are you still there?"
"RORY: Yeah! still here, Grandma."
"EMILY: I was wondering if you could possibly fill in for me. I would be so grateful."
"RORY: (disbelievingly) Me? At the mixer? (picks up the phone and takes it off speaker)"
"EMILY: It's all ready to go. The menu is set, and these new caterers I found are fabulous. All you have to do is smile and make sure everyone's cocktails are replenished."
"RORY: Well..."
"EMILY: Just picture that snake doing the splits."
"RORY: Um, okay, Grandma. I'll help you out."
"EMILY: Oh, bless you. I'll check in a little later and give you a briefing about some of the canapes."
"RORY: Good, 'cause I'm rusty on canapes."
"EMILY: Call you later."
"RORY: Okay, bye, Grandma. Stay warm. (hangs up and looks over to her closet in shock. It is now almost empty) Maid? N...This is not going to work. Maid?! (exits to look for the maid)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, morning. Sookie and Jackson are arguing)"
"SOOKIE: A bath?! A baptism is nothing like taking a bath!"
"JACKSON: I'm not saying it's a bath! I'm just saying if you don't believe in the religious aspect of it, then it's like a bath. As simple and as brief as a bath."
"LORELAI: (walks in with a mug in hand) Coffee."
"SOOKIE: It is so not like taking a bath! When you take a bath, there are candles and water-warped entertainment weeklies to read, and soap. There are not people standing around praying over you, at least not when I take a bath."
"LORELAI: Who's getting baptized?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, our kids are. Because apparently we're suddenly super-religious."
"LORELAI: No kidding? Hey, would you guys mind moving over just a little bit? Thanks (squeezes herself between Sookie and Jackson to get to the coffee pot)"
"JACKSON: Sookie, look at the baptism as a bargaining chip. If we give my mother this, then it'll soften the blow when she finds out that we're not having any more children because of the vasectomy."
"SOOKIE: They'll want to stay at the house, if we have this baptism. Your whole family."
"JACKSON: We'll just have to make room."
"SOOKIE: How? The house is barely big enough for us and the kids. And we'll end up sleeping on a leaky air mattress in the kids' room and getting horrible creaks in our neck while your mother blasts her ""Flatt And Scruggs"" CD. And your cousins are gonna be picking their teeth with my Reida paring knives."
"JACKSON: Oh, like your family is so easy! What about the time we had to see your stuttering cousin Odell in the worst production of ""Nicholas Nickleby"" known to man?! That was like nine hours of pure hell! And did I get to fake a heart attack during intermission? No!"
"SOOKIE: I'm sorry. There is a difference between nine hours and three full days. There's 48 hours plus 24, whatever that is, minus 9 hours. What does that equal? 48 and 24, so that's, uh... eight and four... and that's two...(puts her hands on her forehead, seems like he's getting a headache) and 10 over."
"LORELAI: Whoa! Whoa! Sookie, don't do math. You know that hurts your head."
"SOOKIE: (still holding her head) Ow."
"LORELAI: Hey, I have an idea. If you're gonna have the baptism and you've got three days of family in town, how about if they all stay here?"
"SOOKIE: At the inn?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Just give me the dates. We'll work it out."
"SOOKIE: And that would be okay?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, you're part owner of the place."
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah."
"JACKSON: That would really help."
"LORELAI: So, cool. I'll take care of the arrangements. Sookie, you just deal with the post-baptism party."
"SOOKIE: Oh. I didn't know anything about a post-baptism party. (to Jackson) You didn't tell me anything about a post-baptism party."
"JACKSON: I didn't know myself."
"SOOKIE: (excited) I've got some late-summer salad recipes I've been wanting to try out."
"LORELAI: Oh, perfect. Okay, well, just let Michel know how many rooms you need, and I'll see you guys later."
"JACKSON: Thanks, Lorelai."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, thanks, hon. (Lorelai starts to exit)"
"JACKSON: I just need the invoice signed for the zucchini and I'm off."
"SOOKIE: (picks up a zucchini) Oh, you think I'm taking this zucchini? (Lorelai turns around and approaches the couple again)"
"JACKSON: You ordered them."
"SOOKIE: You stressed them out."
"JACKSON: Don't point that thing at me."
"LORELAI: Guys."
"SOOKIE: I can tell. Get them out of here."
"JACKSON: No! You give me the invoice. (Lorelai turns around and leaves)"
"SOOKIE: I'll just have one of my guys get them out of here."
"JACKSON: This isn't about the zucchini. This is about the baptism."
"SOOKIE: Well, I christen these vegetables sucky!"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, afternoon. Rory is hosting the DAR mixer. The waiters circulate the room with trays full of canapes and the DAR ladies seem to be enjoying themselves)"
"RORY: (to one of the ladies) Oh, hello, Sarah. Thank you so much for coming. (to a waiter with a half empty tray) Excuse me. Hold on a sec. This tray is half empty. Should we fill it up to make it look less sad?"
"WAITER: Uh, this is the last tray."
"RORY: (shocked) What? Oh, no. (checks a small note book) Oh, boy, there are only eight trays of salmon puffs allotted for the whole night? (waiter nods) This is not good. This is really not good. Do you think I should have staggered their release? I should have. I should have staggered their release. Okay, well, just spread them out, and then push the shrimp. Okay, you can circulate now. Circulate. (waiter walks off and Rory approaches another waiter) Uh, excuse me. There's garnish on this tray. There shouldn't be. My grandmother hates garnish. Here, I'll just, uh...(takes the garnish from the trey and puts it in her pocket) there you go. Okay, go, circulate. (the waiter walks away and Rory approaches a group of women) Circulate. (to one of the DAR ladies in the group) Hello, Lana."
"LANA: Hello."
"RORY: Nice to see you. Carole, hello. Great dress."
"CAROLE: Thank you."
"RORY: Darla, does the pearls council know about you? Fabulous. (walks away and approaches two other women) Everything all right over here, ladies?"
"DAR LADY1: Everything's perfect, Rory. This is a lovely party. And those salmon puffs? Insane."
"RORY: Aren't they, though? Eight trays, and they're almost gone. I might have to go grab a pole and do some fishing. (the ladies giggle) Let me know if you need anything. (walk over to the paintings where Nora, the curator and another DAR member are discussing)"
"NORA: I like the way he paints Washington's hair. It looks so luminous. If Gilbert Stuart were alive today, I would absolutely commission him to paint a portrait of my Henry."
"CURATOR: Well, Martha Washington had the same impulse. In 1796, she commissioned Stuart to do a portrait of her husband along with the one of herself to hang at Mount Vernon."
"DAR LADY2: Henry's not Nora's husband. He's her Springer spaniel."
"CURATOR: Oh."
"RORY: May I freshen your drink, Nora?"
"NORA: Well, thank you, Rory. That's awfully sweet of you. (hands Rory her glass) Vodka tonic. (whispering) No ice and light on the tonic."
"RORY: I'll be right back. (walks off)"
"NORA: Isn't she just darling? (as soon as Rory's out off site she starts running towards one of the waitresses)"
"RORY: (hands Nora's glass to the waitress) Excuse me? Hi. The woman with the red hair over by the paintings, could you get her a vodka tonic, please, ASAP? (waitress nods and walks away) Thanks. (calling after her) No ice and light on the tonic."
"(CUT to patio, continuous. Rory walks outside. Two women ask for her attention)"
"NANCY: Oh, Rory, perfect. Maybe you could help us with something."
"RORY: Absolutely."
"NANCY: We're admiring this plant here, this one with the waxy leaves, and yet the name for it has gone right spot out of our heads."
"RORY: I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what it's called. But I promise to ask my Grandmother and let you know. (reaches in her pocket for the little notepad) Let me just get your phone number here. (the garnish from before falls out also) Oops! (they giggle as we see Logan in the back coming out on the patio) Garnish. You just can't get away from it, huh? Um, (notices Logan) excuse me for a minute. (walks towards him. He doesn't seem to be in a good mood) Hey, I didn't know you were coming. (they share an awkward hug)"
"LOGAN: Yeah. I forgot you had a thing today. (looks around miserably)"
"RORY: Oh, it's okay, 'cause now I get to show you off. (drags him over to the ladies she was talking to before) Nancy, Lucy, I'd like to introduce Logan Huntzberger. Logan, this is Nancy Osgood and Lucy Faxton-Field."
"LUCY: How do you do, Logan? It's such a pleasure to meet the young Huntzberger."
"LOGAN: Hey."
"RORY: (surprised by his behaviour, tries conversationally) Uh, Logan, I think I've told you about Nancy. She's the one who insists I look like Clara Barton, which I'm still not sure is a compliment."
"NANCY: Oh, it's a compliment, of the highest order. (the ladies chuckle while Logan is still unmoved)"
"RORY: Um, well, if you'll excuse us, I think I promised Logan one of the coveted salmon puffs."
"LUCY: So nice to meet you, Logan. (Logan nods and then he and Rory walk away)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion kitchen, continuous. Rory and Logan walk in. Rory walks to the coffee pot and Logan spots a bottle of scotch he helps himself with)"
"RORY: (reaches for a mug) Want some coffee? (sees Logan pouring scotch) With your scotch?"
"LOGAN: Sorry. I'm just not in the mood to deal with this type of thing right now, these type of people."
"RORY: Why? Did something happen?"
"LOGAN: So how long do you think this thing's gonna last?"
"RORY: Um...an hour, hour and a half tops. And then 15 minutes for me to pay the caterers, and make sure the cleaning staff knows what to do. Hey, I have an idea. Why don't you go hang out in the pool house, and then I'll come out as soon as I finish up here? We could talk. (walks over to him)"
"LOGAN: Yeah, okay. (kisses he cheek)"
"RORY: (goes over to the coffee pot and tries to pour coffee. The pot is empty) We need coffee! There's no more coffee. (a bit hysterical) Someone make me some coffee!(exits the kitchen)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, night. PA is sitting waiting for dinner. Lorelai approaches him with a bowl)"
"LORELAI: Okay, Paul Anka, dinner time. You need to eat tonight, okay? Now, this is the kibble you like, in the nice, new, yellow bowl that you picked. (puts the bowl down) I will now...(picks up a plate from the counter with her dinner) I will now back out of the room so you can eat...(turns the light off) in the dark, like you like. (walks out of the now dark kitchen)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's living room, continuous. Lorelai puts the plate on the bed and turns on the TV. She notices the tape with the movie ""Riding The Bus With My Sister"" - the one she was talking about with Luke. She sits in the bed, picks up the phone and starts dialing. It rings once, then beeps and an operator picks up)"
"OPERATOR: We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in serv..."
"(Lorelai hangs up and dials again. Same drill - ring, beep, operator)"
"OPERATOR: We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you've reached this number in...(Lorelai hungs up and looks sad)"
"(CUT to pool house, night. We hear music and noises. Rory looks through the glass door and is a bit surprised. Rory enters the pool house holding a napkin and sees that apparently Finn and Colin have now joined Logan, who's sitting on the couch. Finn is talking on the phone and walking around, while Colin pours himself I drink)"
"FINN: (on the phone) So, cancel with him, darling, is that so difficult? (notices Rory and waves. She waves back) I find the fact that you love him completely irrelevant."
"RORY: (to Logan) What's going on?"
"LOGAN: (a bit tipsy) Hey, is that my salmon puff?"
"RORY: (presents him with the napkin) Yeah."
"LOGAN: (taking the salmon puff) Anything is good in a puff. Hi. (reaches out to kiss her)"
"RORY: Hi. (they kiss)"
"COLIN: Hey, Rory."
"RORY: Hey, Colin. I didn't know you guys were coming over."
"LOGAN: I invited them over. I hope that's cool."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, of course it's cool. I just...I would have brought more puffs."
"LOGAN: You need a drink. (gets up from the couch to prep Rory a drink)"
"RORY: Ah"
"no, I..."
"FINN: Somebody give me a sonnet. Melissa's a poetry major."
"COLIN: There once was a gal from Nantucket."
"FINN: Stop it, Colin. I'm not trying to propose. (seductively) Melissa...do you miss me, darling? (a blond girl approaches the group)"
"RORY: (notices the girl and greats her) Hi. (the girl seems unmoved) Uh, Logan?"
"LOGAN: Yeah, Ace? (gives Rory a drink)"
"RORY: (taking the drink) Who's the skirt?"
"LOGAN: Ah. That is Colin's milkmaid."
"RORY: He brought her back from Holland?"
"COLIN: Yes, he did."
"RORY: Oh. (walk over to the milkmaid) Hi. I'm Rory. I've heard a lot about you."
"COLIN: She doesn't understand English."
"RORY: Oh. (to milkmaid) Sorry."
"COLIN: Yes, aren't we all."
"RORY: Colin, rude!"
"COLIN: Everywhere I go, everything I do, surprise!, there she is."
"RORY: Well, you brought her here. What did you expect?"
"COLIN: I don't know what happened. When we were in the Netherlands, she seemed so amazing, you know? (Rory and Logan sit back on the couch) But the minute we left, she began to lose her appeal."
"RORY: Well everything looks appealing when you're stumbling out of an Amsterdam coffee bar."
"FINN: Tell me about it. One night I spent half an hour hitting on a bike. (on the phone) Maria! You're the only one that can save me."
"COLIN: Rory, you have to understand. Milkmaids are, like, iconic over there. They're practically Dutch superheroes. Dating Katrinka was like dating Wonder Woman."
"RORY: Katrinka."
"LOGAN: Yeah. He's gonna be hearing about that one for a long time."
"FINN: (on the phone) Oh...I see. Well, just so you know, I think you're an awfully sweet girl to date a guy with such an unfortunate skin condition. (hangs up and turns to Rory) Rory?"
"RORY: hmm?"
"FINN: Any chance you're breaking up with Logan in the next 20 minutes?"
"RORY: Sorry."
"FINN: Damn. (starts dialling. On the phone) Veronica! (Kartika hugs Colin lovingly) Finn. Still engaged, darling? Well, I am, too, but I'm not going to say in what."
"RORY: (to Logan) So, this is a surprise. The guys being here and everything."
"LOGAN: Well, Colin just got back. I hadn't seen him. Is that okay?"
"RORY: Oh! Yeah, it's fine. I just...well you seemed like you were kind off in a bad mood earlier."
"LOGAN: Well, this is how you get out of a bad mood, Ace. (to the group) Hey, let's get something to eat. I'm starving."
"COLIN: Yes. (gets up quickly to get away from Katrika. She looks sad) Chinese food. No dairy in Chinese food."
"FINN: Perfect. General Lee's has that adorable waitress with a very tiny intellect. Let's go."
"LOGAN: (to Rory) General Lee's?"
"RORY: General Lee's. Just give me a minute, and I'll go change."
"LOGAN: No way! You've got that hot librarian thing going on. I like it. Grab a book. Let's go."
"RORY: (giggling) Kay...(they get up from the couch and the whole group, minus Katrika starts to exit)"
"FINN: I've got g*n."
"COLIN: No, you don't. You're driving. (Rory turns the music off and sees that Katrika is not following)"
"FINN: I can reach over to steer. (the boys leave as Rory stays behind with Katrika)"
"RORY: (calling after the boys) Uh, Colin?! You forgot your milkmaid! (the girls sit and stare at each other. Katrika looks sad, and Rory gives her a faint smile)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn, morning. Lorelai and Michel are at the front desk arranging Jackson's family rooms. Lorelai is corresponding rooms to people and Michel is putting the keys in envelopes)"
"LORELAI: Okay, room five just checked out, so let's give that to Jackson's sister Adele. Put cousin Rachel in room three and aunt Pat and uncle Rusty in room six. (Michel puts a key in the last envelope) Okay, that's two people in room six. Aunt Pat and uncle Rusty. They're gonna need two keys."
"MICHEL: I gave them one. They can share. It's the least the freeloading hicks can do."
"LORELAI: They're not freeloading hicks. They're our guests."
"MICHEL: They are moochers. They go supermarket-hopping to gorge themselves on free samples and get their perfume from magazine inserts. You can recognize them from the paper cuts on their wrists."
"SOOKIE: (running up to the front desk) Jackson not here yet?"
"MICHEL: No. But his family's arrival is imminent, so I'm off to nail the furniture to the floor. (walk way)"
"SOOKIE: (upset) I don't believe it. The whole clan will be here any minute."
"LORELAI: (walks over to Sookie) Sookie, relax."
"SOOKIE: I can't relax, it's Jackson's family. I try to say nice things to them, but they misinterpret it and they think I'm insulting them. So I've tried being really quiet, and then they get all like, ""Why are you so quiet?"". So I overcompensate and start cracking jokes like I'm carrot top, and I start doing funny things with props and I hate prop comedy."
"LORELAI: We all do, honey. (Jackson storms in breathless, like he's been running)"
"JACKSON: They're right behind me."
"SOOKIE: Jackson, you almost left me buffer-less. What happened?"
"JACKSON: Aphids happened. All over my tomatoes. And I was squirting them, and they're multiplying, and I lost track of time. So I start racing over here on foot, and I saw Bo's minivan just in front of me, so I cut through the thicket, and you know how I hate the thicket, just so I could get here first. Oh, my god, my breath. I can't catch my breath. I'm breathing out, but I can't breathe in."
"LORELAI: Okay, Jackson, calm down. You're here, right? (to Sookie) He's here. Your buffer's here. (walks back to the front desk)"
"SOOKIE: I got my buffer. It'll be okay."
"JACKSON: (to Sookie) Okay, so, did you tell hmm-hmm about hmm-hmm? (gesturing towards Lorelai who's now behind the front desk)"
"SOOKIE: No, he's your family. You tell hmm-hmm about hmm-hmm. (gesturing the same way as Jackson. Lorelai looks up at them)"
"LORELAI: Why do I get the feeling I'm at least one of the ""hmm-hmm""s? (Sookie and Jackson start walking up to the front desk)"
"JACKSON: Lorelai, we need to tell you something. Remember my brother Bo?"
"LORELAI: Uh, dark hair, coarse stubble, Jefferson Davis tattoo?"
"JACKSON: He thinks you're a nympho."
"LORELAI: A what?"
"SOOKIE: It's short for nymphomaniac. It means you really dig the fellas."
"LORELAI: I know what it means, but how? I didn't say two words to the guy when I met him. I said one: ""Hi"". And that was not in response to, ""What's your sex drive like?""."
"LORELAI: Apparently, cousin Rune told him."
"LORELAI: Rune! Short guy, light hair, thought marijuana gave your salad zest?"
"JACKSON: That's the one. Bo said Rune said you're a horn dog."
"LORELAI: A horn dog?"
"JACKSON: His word, not mine."
"SOOKIE: His family, not mine. (Jackson's family start entering the Inn. Lorelai, Sookie and Jackson notice)"
"SOOKIE: Mom! (quietly to Jackson) Buffer. (to her mother in-law) Welcome to the Dragonfly! (they hug, as the rest of the family walk in and Jackson walks over to them)"
"JACKSON: Hi, everybody. (to a relative who has trouble holding up all his luggage, and it's quite a lot) Oh, my, that's quite a bit of luggage for three days. You are just staying three days, aren't you? (Bo walks up to the door)"
"BEAU: That's right, little brother. Three days! Why don't you all relax. I'll take care of checking us in. (walks over to the front desk where Lorelai is waiting to check them in) Well, hello, LG."
"LORELAI: (uncomfortable) Welcome to the Dragonfly Inn."
"BEAU: Welcome to Bo."
"LORELAI: (trying to sound casual) Nice sunglasses. Very ""Risky Business."""
"BEAU: Risky business, huh? (what would be a seductive tone) Are you into risky business?"
"LORELAI: No. All of a sudden I hate it. Tom Cruise in his underwear makes me want to barf. Would you like to register?"
"BEAU: I would love to. (takes a pen and sings, without taking his eyes off Lorelai)"
"LORELAI: You just signed the blotter."
"BEAU: Oh, whoops. Sorry. I was distracted."
"LORELAI: Well, um, you're in room 7. So just take a right at the top of the stairs and enjoy your stay."
"BEAU: Well, aren't you accommodating. Guess I'll just go get my duffel bag out of the minivan. (walks away, as Jackson approaches the front desk)"
"LORELAI: (to Jackson) That's the first time I ever heard the word ""duffel"" sound dirty."
"JACKSON: I am so, so sorry."
"LORELAI: All right, here are their keys. Names are on the envelopes. They can go up any time. (gives the envelopes to Jackson)"
"JACKSON: (takes the envelopes) I am so, so sorry. (Sookie walks up to the front desk area)"
"SOOKIE: (a bit disgusted) Ooh, uncle Artie hugged me too long."
"JACKSON: Lorelai checked Bo in."
"SOOKIE: (to Lorelai) We are so, so sorry."
"JACKSON: Keys!"
"SOOKIE: Let's get them upstairs."
"JACKSON: I got your keys, everybody. (walks over to his family to give away the keys) Come and get them. Come and get them.(as Jackson is passing out the keys Bo walks back in, and stops at the front desk area before he goes up the stairs. He knocks on the doorframe to get Lorelai's attention)"
"BEAU: Just thought I'd give you my room number, princess."
"LORELAI: I have it. Remember, I checked you in about a minute ago?"
"BEAU: All right, then. See you soon. (licks his key in what he would think a suctive way. Lorelai shakes her head in disgust as she exhales sharply)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Zach and Brian are sitting at a table as Lane works. Zach looks deep in thought as Brian is eating. Lane approaches them)"
"LANE: (to Brian) He asleep?"
"BRIAN: He's waiting for his muse."
"ZACH: Don't say it like that."
"BRIAN: Like what?"
"ZACH: All condescending. It's not cool."
"BRIAN: I wasn't condescending."
"ZACH: Songwriting is about making yourself open and vulnerable so that the lyrics come out true. If I'm being sensitive, that's a by-product of my craft."
"BRIAN: I hear you."
"ZACH: Okay, now you just patronized me."
"BRIAN: I wasn't patronizing you."
"LANE: Carry on. (walks away)"
"ZACH: What's with her being all dismissive?"
"BRIAN: Hey, you want to get more fries?"
"ZACH: Oh! Yes! Yes! Dude, you said ""fries,"" and it hit me."
"BRIAN: Really?"
"ZACH: Quick, get this down."
"BRIAN: (rapidly cleans his hands gets ready to take notes) Go."
"ZACH: (in melodical voice) Ah ah ah ah-ah oh-oh-oooh"
"BRIAN: (confused) Wait! What?"
"ZACH: Just get it down before I forget it. (sings the melody again) Ah ah ah ah-ah oh-oh-oooh"
"BRIAN: It's not lyrics."
"ZACH: Duh! It's a melody. Come on. (melody) Ah ah ah ah-ah oh-oh-oooh"
"BRIAN: OK, OK."
"ZACH: Get it?"
"BRIAN: I think so. (trying to imitate the melody) Up, down, further down, little higher up, down a smidge."
"ZACH: (frustrated) Brian!"
"BRIAN: I don't read music."
"ZACH: Great! Lane, come here. Ah ah ah ah-ah oh-oh-oooh. (Lane comes over)"
"LANE: What?"
"ZACH: I need your cell phone so I can call home and leave a tune on our machine."
"LANE: I don't bring my cell phone to work."
"ZACH: (frustrated) Ugh! Ah ah ah ah-ah oh-oh-oooh"
"LANE: Um, you're starting to freak out some of the customers. (pats Zach on the back and walks away)"
"BRIAN: I just want you to know I feel really helpless right now. (Sookie storms in the diner)"
"SOOKIE: (walking quickly towards the counter, behind which Luke is standing) Luke, Luke, Luke! look, look, look! Oh! Luke, Luke, Luke, look, look, look. Ha! That was kind of funny. It just came out."
"LUKE: Sookie, I'm working."
"SOOKIE: I know. I just came by to show you this. (holds up a wedding cake-topper)"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"SOOKIE: This is a vintage cake-topper. Porcelain bisque, hand-painted, I think the 1940s. Shoulder pads on the shoulders. A, ha! I found it at a flea market this morning. It's perfect."
"LUKE: Perfect for what?"
"SOOKIE: For your and Lorelai's wedding cake."
"LUKE: Oh, well, that's nice."
"SOOKIE: Nice? Nice? It's not nice, it's fate. Look. (hold the cake-topper so the bride and grooms rear ends are facing Luke) Perhaps this looks familiar. His butt. It's your butt. (points to the porcelain butt) It's your butt, Luke. It's your butt."
"LUKE: Sookie, stop screaming, ""It's your butt"". People are eating."
"SOOKIE: What are the odds of me finding a cake-topper with exactly your butt? (bends over the counter to check out Luke)"
"LUKE: (serving an order) Turkey burger with Swiss."
"SOOKIE: Oh, when I found this topper, your whole cake came to me, like in a vision. White and sparkly with beautiful daisies made of fondant on the top."
"LUKE: (serving another order) Cow burger with cheddar."
"SOOKIE: So, now that I know the cake, all you have to do is set the date. When is the date?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"SOOKIE: What do you mean, you don't know?"
"LUKE: I mean I don't know. (walks around the counter to clear a table and Sookie follows him)"
"SOOKIE: Luke, Miss Manners said you're not really engaged until you have a ring and a date."
"LUKE: Yeah, and it's tacky to drink from a can, but there you go."
"SOOKIE: Luke, please."
"LUKE: Look, you know the drill here, Sookie. We're not setting a date until things are settled between Lorelai and Rory."
"SOOKIE: And when exactly is that going to be?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"SOOKIE: Well, what do you plan to do about it?"
"LUKE: Nothing."
"SOOKIE: Nothing? What kind of an answer is that?"
"LUKE: Sookie, it's between them. (walks over behind the counter again, as Sookie sits from the other side of it) Me and my butt are staying out of it."
"SOOKIE: Oh, come on. You know this whole non-talking thing between Lorelai and Rory is ridiculous, and you know it."
"LUKE: I do know it. (serves an order at the far end of the counter) Grilled cheese, double order fries."
"SOOKIE: Well, all I can say is that those two better make up before your butt falls and this gorgeous antique cake-topper is nothing more than a kitschy piece of junk from the 1940s. (a car starts honking and it catches her attention) Crap. I got to go. I left Jackson's mother in the car. Maybe I should have cracked the window. (exits the diner. Luke walks to the other end of the counter. Zach is on the diner phone singing his tune)"
"ZACH: Ah Ah Ah oh oh ohohoh (Luke takes the phone from him and hungs up)"

"(CUT to outside of band's apartment, night. Lane walks up the drive way. She greats someone on her way to the door)"
"LANE: Hi, Mrs. Lamkin."
"Mrs.LAMKIN: Hi Lane (enters the apartment)"
"(CUT to inside apartment, continuous. As Lane enters she stumbles on some boxes and electronical equipment. Zach and Brian are occupying themselves with said equipment)"
"LANE: What is going on? What is that?"
"ZACH: Hey! This is the G5 dual 2.3 with a one-Gig RAM upgrade."
"BRIAN: And this 3 1/2-inch aluminum casing houses a 300-Gig hard drive."
"ZACH: And we got pro tools, too. We're gonna be able to record like a million tracks every song. We can burn, mix, and edit our own CDs. It's gonna be nuts."
"BRIAN: Yeah, just as soon as we figure out how to turn it on."
"LANE: But how? When did...? (looks over to the boys and at their looks it hits her) Oh, my God! The tour money! (rushes over to her room. Yelling OS) You went into my underwear drawer?! (walk back in the living room) I cannot believe that you went into my underwear drawer."
"ZACH: But that's where the tour money was."
"LANE: But that was my underwear drawer."
"ZACH: It was business, not pleasure, Lane."
"BRIAN: I had my eyes closed the entire time. It was all by feel."
"LANE: That was my room. My private inner sanctum, and you ransacked it."
"ZACH: Hey! We could be mad too you know! Frankly the fact that you felt you had to hide the tour money from us is pretty insulting."
"BRIAN: Yeah, and that money was for recording equipment, anyway. So what's the big deal?"
"LANE: But did you at least shop around? I mean, did you go through the stack of research I have on recording equipment, cost comparisons, audio magazine articles? Did you happen to look at any of that?"
"BRIAN: Jeez, we didn't go through all your stuff, Lane."
"LANE: I can't believe you just went out and spent nine grand without talking to me."
"ZACH: It wasn't the plan. I mean we just cruised by the store to get a microcassette recorder so I could preserve my tunes. And there was this sales guy..."
"BRIAN: (interrupts) a great guy."
"ZACH: A really great guy. And we ended up talking to him about music."
"BRIAN: And Zach sang him his tune."
"ZACH: Which he totally dug. Reminded him of early Smiths."
"BRIAN: Great guy."
"ZACH: He was! And he was like, ""You should get this"". And he was like, ""this is the last day of our once-a-year sale, and everything's 30% off"", and he showed us this whole system."
"BRIAN: He spent like an hour with us."
"ZACH: Totally great guy."
"BRIAN: He thinks we're gonna be huge."
"LANE: Was there change?"
"ZACH: Huh?"
"LANE: Did the totally great guy give you any change? (the boys look at each other confused and then back at Lane you yells frustrated) Uuuugghh! (exits to her room a tad pissed and bangs the door)"
"ZACH: She totally would have liked him."
"BRIAN: 'Cause he was a great guy."
"(CUT to Drangonfly Inn, night. Lorelai walking the library with some board game sot put away. Michel is there)"
"MICHEL: I believe Jackson's aunt Pat is borrowing DVDs from our collection, and secretly burning copies for her own DVD library."
"LORELAI: What makes you think she's not watching the DVDs?"
"MICHEL: The Belleville's are freeloaders. The whole lot of them. They are as cheap as tan panty hose with white sandals. Plus, I believe they have emptied all the booze from the minibars upstairs into their own flask and then refilled the bottles with water."
"LORELAI: Can I interest you in a sick day?"
"MICHEL: Pssh! I would not give them the satisfaction. (starts exiting the library, Lorelai follows, and Sookie is walking towards them) Oh, how proud a family reunion must be for you. (walks away)"
"LORELAI: He's snarky."
"SOOKIE: And sarcastic."
"LORELAI: He's snarcastic."
"SOOKIE: Hey, do you have a minute? I want to ask you something kind of important."
"LORELAI: Sure, I've got nothing but minutes. (they walk over to a couch and sit)"
"SOOKIE: Well, I was wondering if you would honour me and Jackson by being Martha's godmother."
"LORELAI: (gasps) Oh, wow."
"SOOKIE: Oh! is that a good ""oh, wow"" or a bad ""oh, wow""?"
"LORELAI: It's just ""oh, wow!"". The whole idea of me being a godmother. I never thought of myself as the godmother type. Would I need a wand?"
"SOOKIE: I think you can pull it off without it."
"LORELAI: Aw, jeez, Sookie, I'm touched. I would love to be Martha's godmother."
"SOOKIE: Great. Oh, I'm so happy you said yes. It's going to be great. And we're gonna baptize both kids at once, so Davey's gonna need a godmother, too, and I thought, ""How about Rory?""."
"LORELAI: (a bit uncomfortable) Rory, huh?"
"SOOKIE: Yeah! I thought it would be fun. And I know it's weird with you two now, but there's really no one else I'm close to to ask."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah? Um, what about your friend Kat from the Culinary Institute? You guys roomed together in college."
"SOOKIE: She's been institutionalised."
"LORELAI: What? Really?"
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah. She shaved her head. She thinks she's Susan Powter. Sad."
"LORELAI: Well, how about Theresa? She lived next door to you growing up. Aren't her husband and Jackson best friends?"
"SOOKIE: She moved."
"LORELAI: She moved?"
"SOOKIE: To Peru."
"LORELAI: When?"
"SOOKIE: Yesterday, actually."
"LORELAI: Tall, skinny Margo?"
"SOOKIE: Has an inner-ear problem. Frankly, I'm a little worried that she'll lose her balance holding the baby and fall in the water. And she's taaall, so that's a long way to fall. But, hey, look, if you don't want to do it or you don't want me to ask Rory, then I'll totally understand. I'm sure Jackson will understand, too, and Martha. (looks away in mock disappointment and sounds that way too) Hey, you got to do what you got to do."
"LORELAI: No, no, it's okay. Um, I'll do it."
"SOOKIE: You will?"
"LORELAI: Of course I will."
"SOOKIE: Oh, thank you. (pats Lorelai?s knee gets off the couch and exits the room) It's gonna be a perfect day. (Lorelai doesn't look very pleased, or happy)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's living room, morning. The bed is still there, and Lorelai is lying in bed, wide awake, with Luke as the alarm goes off. She quickly turns it off, gets out of bed and picks out two dresses from a clothes rack as Luke is starting to wake up. She walks over to the bed and holds them up for Luke to see)"
"LORELAI: Which one goes better with a baby?"
"LUKE: (sleepy) I like the green one."
"LORELAI: It's not too sheer? Because I'm gonna be in a church."
"LUKE: Looks good from here."
"LORELAI: Yeah, maybe. Man, she's good. She's really good."
"LUKE: Who?"
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"LUKE: Ah!"
"LORELAI: This whole baptism thing is just a ruse to get me and Rory together. She's played me! She's played me like a Stradivarius."
"LUKE: So, don't go, then."
"LORELAI: No! I got to go."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because she asked me to be a godmother. You don't say no to that."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Look! I know what she's doing. And she knows what she's doing. But no one else knows what she's doing, so on the slight chance that she's not doing what I think she's doing, which is actually just doing what she wants to do, then I will be the jerk who wouldn't be the godmother to her best friend's baby 'cause she thought something was happening that wasn't. And that will be the story everyone remembers, understand?"
"LUKE: I like the green dress. (Lorelai is frustrated)"
"(CUT to pool house bedroom, morning. Rory is lying in bed, wide awake, with Logan as the alarm goes off. She quickly turns it off)"
"LOGAN: (sleepy) Go back to sleep."
"RORY: I have to go to the baptism."
"LOGAN: Blow it off."
"RORY: I can't."
"LOGAN: You can do anything. You just have to believe in yourself. Did we learn nothing from ""Mad Hot Ballroom""?"
"RORY: I have to go to Stars Hollow. (whiney) I have to see my mom. (covers her head with a pillow)"
"LOGAN: One, two, cha cha cha."
"RORY: Uuugh, okay. (puts the pillow away) Nothing left to do but get up and face the music. (gets out of bed and walks over to her closet, picks out two dresses and holds them up for Logan to see) Which goes better with a baby?"
"(CUT to Stars Hollow, morning. Rory drives up in her Prius. She parks the car get out and looks over the town wistfully. She looks at her watch and starts walking)"
"(CUT to band's apartment, continuous. Zach is watching TV, Brian is reading something and Lane is reading the manual of the equipment the guys bought)"
"ZACH: You're wasting your time, Lane."
"BRIAN: That manual's just a bunch of gobbledygook."
"ZACH: Got to be R2-D2 to understand that thing."
"LANE: No, you just have to spend more than six minutes trying to figure it out before giving up."
"ZACH: I can't believe there's a second C-span. (there is a knock on the door and Rory enters)"
"RORY: Hi."
"LANE: (surprised) Rory!"
"RORY: Hi. Am I interrupting anything?"
"ZACH: Nah, there's nothing on."
"LANE: No, you're interrupting nothing. Come on in."
"RORY: (noticing the equipment) Wow, this looks very fancy."
"LANE: Yeah, it's pretty fancy, all right. Apparently is does everything except turn on. You look pretty fancy, too."
"RORY: Oh, I'm on my way over to Sookie's kids' baptism. I'm gonna be Davey's godmother."
"LANE: Very religious. My mother would be impressed."
"ZACH: Hey! Is it true you get to keep the baby if the parents die?"
"RORY: I'm just doing it as a favour for Sookie."
"BRIAN: Godmother, huh? (imitating Marlon Brando) Did you make her an offer she couldn't refuse?"
"ZACH: (impressed) Dude! You nailed that!"
"BRIAN: Thanks."
"LANE: (to Rory) Come on. I need a break from the ADD boys. (nudges Zach on the head as they walk towards Lane's room)"
"ZACH: Whoa! There's a third C-span!"
"(CUT to Lane's bedroom, continuous. The girls walk in)"
"RORY: Room looks the same."
"LANE: Yeah."
"RORY: How come there's a padlock on your dresser drawer?"
"LANE: Uh, wild story. Here, sit. (they walk over to the bed and sit)"
"RORY: So, you look great. Did you get a haircut?"
"LANE: Yeah. Well, maybe a month ago."
"RORY: I like it."
"LANE: Thanks! You look good, too. I like the bangs. Very Marianne Faithfull."
"RORY: Thanks. I'm hoping Mick Jagger notices. (they giggle. They seem a bit uncomfortable) So, you went on tour!?"
"LANE: Yeah, we did."
"RORY: And how was it?"
"LANE: Great."
"RORY: Great. (after an uncomfortable b*at) And, um...how are things in the Zach department? I mean, you two are still together, right?"
"LANE: We are, and it's good. He's good. We're good. How many times can I use the word ""good""?"
"RORY: Have you guys...?"
"LANE: No, no, no, we're still not having sex. But I did tell Zach he could tell the guys we're doing it. It's a little more rock 'n' roll."
"RORY: You are a good girlfriend."
"LANE: So, how's Logan?"
"RORY: Logan is... a constant surprise. I have trouble keeping up with him. He moves a mile a minute, gets bored in two seconds flat. He started flying those scary little planes that seem like they're made of papier-mache, which is thrilling, by the way. And, Logan's good."
"LANE: Wow! Is this serious?"
"RORY: Seriously exciting."
"LANE: I love that. Is it hard with him still at Yale and you living with your grandparents?"
"RORY: No, not really. It's been fine, actually. Taking time off has been great. It was absolutely the right decision for me."
"LANE: That's good. That's really good."
"RORY: Yeah, yeah... I just wish, that my mom could understand that. She's so... I doubt that she will talk to me again until I am back in a dorm room with a course catalogue on my lap, if then. I don't know. Maybe we'll never talk again."
"LANE: You two? Oh, please."
"RORY: We haven't talked in weeks."
"LANE: It'll blow over."
"RORY: She didn't tell me when she and Luke got engaged."
"LANE: Rory, look at me. You and your mom will talk again. This rift is just nature's attempt to find some equilibrium. You and Lorelai have gone too many years without fighting. So you had to have one big fight to make up for it. Now you've had it, and soon you'll make up and then this will all be just your lost weekend."
"RORY: I've missed you."
"LANE: I've missed you, too. (they hug)"
"RORY: We can never go this long without talking again."
"LANE: Deal."
"RORY: I'll do anything."
"LANE: I'll raise carrier pigeons."
"RORY: I'll learn Morse code."
"LANE: I'll send you pigeons, and you can send me code."
"RORY: Okay. (looks at her watch) Oh, it's 10:30. I have fifteen minutes before I have to go. Now, I want to hear all about that tour."
"LANE: OK. Well let's start with the whole ""three boys and no shower"" thing."
"RORY: Oh, Lord!"
"(CUT to outside of church, morning. The Church bells are ringing and we see the announcement for the baptism. Rory is walking towards the church and bumps into Kirk on her way in)"
"RORY: You look nice today, Kirk."
"KIRK: Thanks! This is the suit they buried my dad in."
"RORY: ( a bit stunned) Oh, well...I think I'm gonna let that one go."
"KIRK: So, do you know which is the Davey side of church and which is the Martha?"
"RORY: Oh, I don't think there are sides, Kirk. It's not like a wedding. I think we're all on both kids' sides."
"KIRK: I just didn't want to offend by taking a side if there are sides. I've had some contact with Davey, in passing. Couple of high-fives, one or two peekaboo sessions, but I haven't had much contact with Martha. She seems more reserved. Elusive. There's a bit of Garbo in her. (Kirk walks away, leaving Rory to look up at the Church door)"
"(CUT to front of church doors, continuous. Lorelai and Sookie are chatting and chuckling. Jackson walks up to them clearly upset about something)"
"JACKSON: (to Sookie) I just talked to my former mother, and, oh, you are going to love this. Guess who's getting baptized today?"
"SOOKIE: Who?"
"JACKSON: Me."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: No!"
"SOOKIE: (very happy) Is it Christmas already?"
"JACKSON: This isn't funny."
"SOOKIE: Uh Huh!"
"LORELAI: You've never been baptized?"
"JACKSON: Apparently on the day I was supposed to be baptized, I stuck a quarter up my nose and had to be taken to the hospital. And they never rescheduled."
"SOOKIE: Well, organizational k*ll were never your family's strong point."
"JACKSON: You know what? I have had it with my family! (Lorelai notices Rory walking towards them) I want you to march right over there and tell my mother you're divorcing me if I get baptized."
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah, that will go over very well."
"JACKSON: Okay, fine. Then just say we're getting separated. I guess I better go find out what it means exactly for a grown man to get baptized."
"SOOKIE: (very excited) Oh, my God! Are you gonna wear a giant christening gown?"
"JACKSON: You're really enjoying this, aren't you?"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, you have no idea. (Jackson walks away, and Sookie notices Rory walking towards the church doors) Oh, Rory's here!"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I see that."
"SOOKIE: Boy, that's a pretty dress she's wearing, don't you think?"
"LORELAI: Sure. It'll go good with a baby."
"SOOKIE: Well, I better go check on the kids. (very rushed) Say ""hi"" to Rory for me if you see her first. (runs inside and away from Lorelai. Lorelai and Rory look a bit shocked and uncomfortable)"
"REV.SKINNER: (to the girls) Oh, there you two are. Good. Do you have a minute? I was hoping we could have a quick chat in my office before the ceremony."
"RORY: Oh, well..."
"LORELAI: Um, sure."
"REV.SKINNER: Wonderful. Right this way. (leads them inside)"
"(CUT to Rev.Skinner's office, continuous. He is sitting behind his desk, while Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the other side)"
"REV.SKINNER: So, I always like to take a few minutes before my baptisms to get to know the godparents a little bit. Of course I already know you two, but I just want to touch base and make sure you understand the obligations of what you're getting into here today. Now, basically, godparents are responsible for the spiritual upbringing of their godchildren. I certainly hope the parents throw their two cents in, but the godparents are vitally important figures in a child's life. So, tell me, what are your religious affiliations?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, Reverend, you've known us forever."
"REV.SKINNER: Well, yes, I have, and I still have no idea what your religious affiliations are."
"LORELAI: Oh..."
"RORY: Well..."
"LORELAI: We're a bit lapsed."
"REV.SKINNER: Yes. From...?"
"LORELAI: Well, um...religion. But, you know, I can't speak for Rory, but I have a strong belief in good...you know...over evil. I mean, if I was asked to choose a side..."
"RORY: I read ""The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe""."
"LORELAI: I have a bible. Although I may or may not have accidentally given it to goodwill, because I'm remodelling. But goodwill is a religious organization... I think. But even if it's not, good will. It's in the ballpark."
"RORY: I buy tons of girl-scout cookies."
"LORELAI: I have two ""Mary is my homegirl"" T-shirts."
"REV.SKINNER: Well, these are all very positive if somewhat irrelevant things. And it seems like your hearts are in the right place."
"RORY: Absolutely."
"LORELAI: Definitely."
"REV.SKINNER: And it says something good about you both that when a friend calls you up and asks a favour, you come through like this."
"LORELAI: (obviously having figured something out) Right, right."
"REV.SKINNER: Shall we?"
"RORY: We shall. (Rory and Rev.Skinner get up and start exiting the office. Lorelai remains seated)"
"(CUT to church main hall, continuous. Kirk enters the church and approaches a woman)"
"KIRK: (to woman) So, are you a Davey or a Martha? Davey, I bet, right? He's much more accessible. He's the Dandy Warhols to Martha's Brian Jonestown m*ssacre. (in the back Bo enters the church. He walks a bit and some coins start dropping all over the place)"
"BEAU: Oh. Dang it. (starts picking up the coins. Lorelai, Rory and Rev.Skinner exit the office. Lorelai and Rory take the babies in their arms as Rev Skinner walk up to the podium)"
"SOOKIE: Hey, Rory. You look so pretty."
"RORY: Hey, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Oh, I want a picture of this. (Bo rushes to the front row and sits)"
"REV.SKINNER: (speaking from the podium) Welcome, everybody. Jesus tells Nicodemus in the fourth gospel, ""Unless one is born of water and spirit, one cannot enter the Kingdom of God"". (Lorelai at Rory) Today we gather to honor three individuals as they dedicate themselves in the first sacrament of the faith and become members of the body of the church and the Kingdom of God. Here to bear witness and offer spiritual support are Lorelai Gilmore, godparent to Martha, Rory Gilmore, godparent to Davey, and, uh...Jackson?"
"JACKSON: (to Rev.Skinner) Yo."
"REV.SKINNER: Acting as your godparent will be...?"
"JACKSON: Oh, uh... my brother Bo, I guess."
"REV.SKINNER: And, uh, Bo Belleville will serve as sponsor and witness for Jackson. Will you come up here, please, Bo? (Bo gets up to join everyone else, and more coins drop)"
"BEAU: Oh! Oh, bananas."
"REV.SKINNER: The candidates for baptism will now be presented. (walk way from the podium and approaches the group. Lorelai looks at Sookie suspiciously) We are honoured with the privilege of being here today to witness and support in faith the baptism of David Edward Belleville, Martha Janice-Lori-Ethan-Rupert-Glenda-Carson-Daisy-Danny Belleville, and Jackson Matthew Belleville. I hereby charge Lorelai Gilmore, Rory Gilmore, and Bo Belleville with the responsibility of seeing to the spiritual welfare of these children and this believer. (Lorelai looks from Sookie to Rory and seems a bit peeved) We will now begin a series of ceremonial questions. Lorelai Gilmore, do you renounce Satan and all the spiritual forces that rebel against God? (Lorelai is distracted, looking at Sookie and doesn't answer. Rev.Skinner raised an eyebrow is shock and the audience starts murmuring)"
"SOOKIE: (whispering) Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Why aren't you renouncing Satan?"
"LORELAI: (confused) Huh?"
"SOOKIE: He said, ""Do you renounce Satan?"", and you paused. That's not something you pause about."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, yes, I renounce Satan."
"REV.SKINNER: OK. Rory Gilmore, do you renounce Satan and all the spiritual forces that rebel against God?"
"LORELAI: (whispering to Sookie) Did you call Rory?"
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: Did you call Rory on her cell phone and ask her to be a godmother?"
"RORY: I renounce him."
"REV.SKINNER: Bo Belleville, do you renounce Satan and all the spiritual forces that rebel against God?"
"RORY: (whispering to Lorelai and Sookie, overlapping Rev.Skinner) What are you whispering about?"
"LORELAI: I'm just trying to get some information."
"RORY: What information?"
"BEAU: Satan can kiss my ass."
"LORELAI: (whispering to Rory) How come Sookie had your phone number?"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: She called you to ask you to be here, which means she must have had your phone number."
"REV.SKINNER: Excuse me. Ladies?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, Reverend. Can you just give us a moment, please? (gestures to Rory to go outside. They walk towards the exit)"
"(CUT to outside, continuous. Rory and Lorelai exit the church through the side door)"
"RORY: What is wrong with you?"
"LORELAI: Look, it's not like I really care, okay? It's not like I was gonna call you up to chitchat or make a date to go shoe shopping, or something. But, shouldn't a mother have a way to contact her daughter, at least in case of an emergency? I mean what if I was in an accident and I had to have a blood transfusion? You're the only person in the world with the same blood type. It would really help to have your phone number."
"RORY: We are holding up the service."
"LORELAI: I just think it's weird you would give Sookie your number and not me."
"RORY: I didn't give Sookie my new number. Sookie called Grandma, Grandma left me a note, and then I called Sookie back. And I didn't get a new number. I lost my phone."
"LORELAI: If you lose your phone, you should suspend your service until you get a new one. That way, you get to keep the same number. Ever hear of that? It's ridiculous to get an entirely new number. No one gets an entirely new number."
"RORY: Well, next time, I will suspend my service. (the door opens and Sookie appears)"
"SOOKIE: Um...Hi, guys. We kind of need the kids back."
"LORELAI: OK. (Sookie takes Davey from Rory and goes back inside. Lorelai and Rory follow her)"
"(CUT to outside, after baptism party, morning. There are tables filled with food. Jackson is holding up Martha and Davey and talking Rev.Skinner, while Sookie walks over to Lorelai)"
"SOOKIE: Hey, godmother."
"LORELAI: Hi. So sorry, again, for the drama."
"SOOKIE: You always give me a good story to tell."
"LORELAI: Well, I aim to please."
"SOOKIE: You know, I have a little confession to make."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah?"
"SOOKIE: I kind of asked you and Rory to both be godmothers because I thought it might kind of bring you back together, patch things up."
"LORELAI: (mockingly) Well, blow me down."
"SOOKIE: Didn't fool you, huh?"
"LORELAI: No, but the salads are excellent."
"SOOKIE: The salads are excellent! (Lorelai notices Bo who's calling her over in what he would think a suggestive manner)"
"LORELAI: OK, that's it. (to Sookie) I'll be right back. (walks over to Bo) Hi, Bo."
"BEAU: Hey, darlin'. (licks his thumb and rubs in on Lorelai's sweater, then repeats licking his thumb and rubs it on his sleeve) What do you say we get out of these wet clothes?"
"LORELAI: (disgusted) Listen, Bo. Uh, there's been a misunderstanding here. What Rune told you about me, it's not true."
"BEAU: Really?"
"LORELAI: None of it."
"BEAU: Oh."
"LORELAI: Yeah!"
"BEAU: So you don't have a kid?"
"LORELAI: Uh, Well, no, I do have a kid."
"BEAU: But you didn't get knocked up when you were 16?"
"LORELAI: Well, that part technically is true."
"BEAU: And he said you've never been married. That your single and dating around..."
"LORELAI: Well, I've never been married exactly, but I'm engaged now. That's pretty steady. Very permanent."
"BEAU: He said you were engaged before."
"LORELAI: You know what? It's all true. OK, I'm a horn dog. So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna get some potato salad."
"BEAU: (in that falsely suggestive tone) Potato salad. I get it."
"LORELAI: OK. (walks away from Bo, as Rory comes up to her)"
"RORY: So, I'm leaving."
"LORELAI: OK. Drive safe."
"RORY: Look, I know this is lame at this point, but you can have my new number if you want it."
"LORELAI: That's okay. I can call mom, and she can leave you a note."
"RORY: OK."
"LORELAI: OK. (they walk in opposite directions)"
"(CUT to Rory's car, morning. As she's driving she picks up her phone and makes a call. Phone rings and we CUT to Yale classroom where Logan picks the phone up. The scene switches between Logan in class and Rory in the car)"
"LOGAN: Hello?"
"RORY: Hey."
"LOGAN: Hey! How was the baptism?"
"RORY: Fine. I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I'm not handling things particularly well these days."
"LOGAN: Yeah, I know what you mean."
"RORY: Logan, are you okay?"
"LOGAN: I had a talk with my father the other day, and apparently I'm going to graduate this year. I'm going to get my act together and I'm gonna become a Huntzberger."
"RORY: What does that mean?"
"LOGAN: I'm going to start attending shareholder meetings, letting the boys see my face around. It means my preordained life is kicking in."
"RORY: Oh, I'm sorry."
"LOGAN: Hey, always read the fine print on the family crest."
"RORY: You know, maybe you can talk to your dad and tell him how you feel."
"LOGAN: Hey, how far away are you from the airport?"
"RORY: Why?"
"LOGAN: Let's go to New York."
"RORY: What?"
"LOGAN: New York, you and me, right now, by helicopter."
"RORY: A helicopter? You're kidding."
"LOGAN: We will spend the weekend at the Pierre. You don't have your community service till Monday, right?"
"RORY: Yeah, but..."
"LOGAN: Don't pack. We'll shop. Much more irresponsible."
"RORY: Um...Logan..."
"LOGAN: I'll see you at the airport in 20 minutes, Ace."
"RORY: OK, I'll see you in 20 minutes. (she hangs up and continues driving)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's living room, night. Lorelai is sitting on her bed with PA, a pizza and a bunch of junk food watching the Rosie O'Donnell movie. Lorelai looks very sad)"
"ROSIE O'DONNELL (On TV): I think he's gonna take me for a ride in it."
"MAN (On TV): What about your boyfriend? What about Jesse?"
"ROSIE O'DONNELL (On TV): Jesse's delicious. He's gonna take me today to get a new toilet seat because mine got broken and was sliding. I would fall off of it. I go, ""whoa!"""
"LORELAI: (very sad and disappointed) It's not the same. (takes a red vine and starts to eat it as she pets PA)"
"ROSIE O?DONNELL (On TV): What, am I scaring you? Want me to scare you? Boo boo boo!"
"MAN (On TV): Beth..."

"(OPEN in Luke's diner, morning. Lorelai and Luke walk in carrying a bunch of shopping bags each)"
"LORELAI: Oh! Winded! Too many steps."
"LUKE: I said I'd carry them."
"LORELAI: Need water. g*n din!"
"LUKE: They're not that heavy."
"LORELAI: Yeah! You should take those steps out. They get in the way."
"LUKE: First thing tomorrow. Man, you bought a lot of stuff. (they set the bags on the counter, Luke goes behind it and Lorelai starts looking though them)"
"LORELAI: All stuff I need or want, or think I might someday need or want. (excited) OK now let's find your new wallet!"
"LUKE: We can get it later."
"LORELAI: (looking through some bags) No, it's buried in here somewhere. Have I looked in this bag already?"
"LUKE: You didn't have to buy me a new wallet. My old wallet was fine."
"LORELAI: Your old wallet has Velcro."
"LUKE: It works."
"LORELAI: It's disgusting. Now come on, let's find it. (notices something in one of the bags) Wait a second. What is this?"
"LUKE: (approaching Lorelai) Your underwear. (Lorelai picks out of the bag a huge pink satin pair of panties)"
"LORELAI: (stunned) Uh! Thanks a lot!"
"LUKE: (suppressing a laugh) I didn't see how big they were. What are they doing in there?"
"LORELAI: Well, I'm guessing probably hiding from their real owners, 'cause I would hate to be wrapped around the woman who fit those."
"LUKE: Maybe you just grabbed the wrong bag."
"LORELAI: (takes out a huge pair of bunny slippers and sets them on the counter) Oh, poor thing, she's single. (her cell phone rings and she reaches for it. Luke clears his throat and points at the ""No Cell Phones"" sign)"
"LUKE: It still applies. (Lorelai answers the phone anyway)"
"LORELAI: Hello? Sookie? Sookie, slow down, I can't understand a word you're saying."
"LUKE: (amused looking at the slippers) She's got huge feet."
"LORELAI: The Inn's on fire?!"
"LUKE: (concerned) What?"
"LORELAI: The stove is on fire? Well, put it out. It's out? So you're saying, there was a fire, but now it's out. Good, what's the damage?"
"LUKE: You had a fire?"
"LORELAI: Okay, okay, good. I'll be right there. (hangs up. To Luke) The wall behind the stove caught fire. There's damage, but nothing major. Thank God."
"LUKE: (quickly walks over to Lorelai) Come on. I'll take you."
"LORELAI: Oh, my God! Another fire at the Inn, like the Independence Inn. Oh, no! Am I a fire starter? I'm a fire starter, aren't I?"
"LUKE: You are not a fire starter. (calls to the kitchen) Caesar, we'll be right back."
"LORELAI: What about the bags?"
"LUKE: Caesar will put the bags away. Let's go."
"LORELAI: Go first, in case things burst into flames behind me as I walk."
"LUKE: Will do. (the start to exit the diner)"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, morning. Luke and Jackson are working over at the stove. Lorelai, Sookie and Michel are further away talking)"
"SOOKIE: I saw my whole life pass before my eyes. That's how traumatic it was!"
"MICHEL: She's been Scarlett O'Hara for two hours. It's sickening."
"SOOKIE: My whole life. Flash! I mean, that's upsetting! You know, not that it's been a bad life, although I could have skipped seeing ""Mummenschanz."""
"LUKE: Do you want to hand me the screwdriver?"
"JACKSON: I would kind of need a third hand to do that."
"LORELAI: Why are the boys bickering?"
"SOOKIE: There's something in the air today."
"JACKSON: (Luke holds up a flashlight in Jackson's direction) Could you not shine that in my face?"
"LUKE: Just move your face."
"JACKSON: You mean off of my head?"
"LORELAI: So, Mutt and Jeff, what's the prognosis there?"
"LUKE: When's the last time you checked your ductwork?"
"SOOKIE: Never. Oh, boy, I shouldn't be allowed in a kitchen!"
"LUKE: (walking away from the stove) My guess is that the grease built up in the back, and the ventilation's not great, and the wall heated up, and it b*rned."
"LORELAI: So what do we do?"
"SOOKIE: Don't tell me we're shut down!"
"LUKE: You'll have to repair the wall before you put the stove back, and you're gonna have to clean your ductwork."
"JACKSON: (walks away from the stove) Which means closing the kitchen till you do."
"SOOKIE: Well, then, fix it now."
"JACKSON: You need a pro to do this."
"LUKE: And if an insurance guy doesn't see it before you fix it, he won't pay."
"MICHEL: Well, I've already talked to the insurance company. They've never heard of us."
"LORELAI: That's impossible. We're customers. We send them a check every month."
"MICHEL: The people I talked to, all very rude, by the way, said they don't even cover businesses such as ours."
"LORELAI: Again, a mistake. I'll get the policy out. I'll call them myself. (to Luke and Jackson) Thank you."
"LUKE: You really should get a second screwdriver."
"JACKSON: Nag, nag, nag. (Luke and Jackson exit the Inn kitchen)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion patio, morning. The DAR ladies, Emily and Rory are having drinks and talking)"
"NORA: We should be flayed."
"NANCY: Don't overreact, Nora."
"NORA: We should never have let it get to this point. We're all at fault here."
"VIVIAN: It's a humiliation."
"EMILY: Ladies, we know this. No one is more embarrassed than myself, but what are we going to do?"
"NANCY: How many tables are still unsold?"
"EMILY: Over half."
"DAR LADIES: (upset) Oh! Unbelievable!"
"VIVIAN: This is a function for our troops."
"NORA: We'll be the laughingstock of the DAR. We'll lose our national accreditation, and this is a very weak drink."
"EMILY: It's just punch, Nora."
"NORA: My point, dear."
"EMILY: I simply don't understand people."
"DAR LADY2: This money was designated for additional armor for the boys at Fort Drum."
"VIVIAN: We've insulted the organization, insulted our troops..."
"NORA: We might as well all march to Mount Vernon, drop our drawers, and do something foul on George Washington's grave."
"EMILY: (disapprovingly) Nora!"
"NORA: I'm sorry, but I'm really upset about this, and I'm far too sober to put it in any sort of perspective."
"RORY: But the function is still a week away. There's time to fix this. (the ladies make cutesy ""Oh"" sounds)"
"VIVIAN: Rory, you're darling."
"EMILY: She's new, ladies."
"VIVIAN: A week is nothing."
"EMILY: Again, what do we do?"
"NANCY: We should cancel the event."
"EMILY: This is a nightmare."
"VIVIAN: Is Constance not showing her face on purpose?"
"EMILY: Would you?"
"RORY: Why would Constance...?"
"EMILY: She's running the event...into the ground. I blame myself. I let her talk me into it."
"NANCY: She's never slipped up like this before."
"RORY: Is it definitely too late to do something?"
"EMILY: To do what?"
"RORY: I don't know. To publicize the event more, get those tables sold?"
"EMILY: We spent our budget for publicity. We're wiped out."
"RORY: But a budget is just an estimation. It's guesswork, fake numbers. In any business endeavour, sometimes it makes sense to run a deficit in order to achieve a bigger payoff later."
"NORA: We're lunching with Grover Norquist."
"RORY: Well, have we tried getting the word out online? A lot can be done that way. (the ladies listen carefully and seem impressed and interested) And maybe we can add some entertainment or a theme. Send out some e-mails. E-mailing doesn't cost a thing."
"EMILY: We hadn't thought about e-mail."
"RORY: I think there's a way to correct this. A week is plenty of time."
"NORA: Well, well, well, we have a star amongst us."
"RORY: (chuckles) Who?"
"NORA: You!"
"RORY: (taken aback) Me?"
"NORA: (defiant) Take it over."
"RORY: What?"
"VIVIAN: I think that's a wonderful idea!"
"EMILY: I don't know. We have a mountain here, ladies."
"NORA: We're screwing the pooch, Emily, and we've got to go balls out. I, for one, will not have those priggish twigs from the New York chapters lording this over us. We need to take a swing here, and Babe Ruth sits before us."
"EMILY: (to Rory) You shouldn't feel pressured."
"RORY: I know."
"NORA: My essence is, that if Rory doesn't think she can do it, she'll turn us down."
"EMILY: I suppose that's true."
"NORA: What do you say, you slugger?"
"RORY: I'll do it. (the ladies make triumphant noises and gestures)"
"NORA: Yes! Let's ring Constance."
"NANCY: We'll put you in touch with the people at the venue immediately."
"NORA: And you'll have an assistant. Lacey. You'll love her."
"DAR LADY2: I'd look at the menu."
"NORA: And we'll set up a discretionary fund. This publicity idea you were thinking of may be the key. (the ladies and Rory start talking about planning the function while Emily looks concerned)"
"(CUT to Sookie and Jackson's house, night. Davey is watching TV, while the Lorelai, Luke and Jackson are eating dinner. Sookie is in the kitchen and starts walking towards the dinning table)"
"SOOKIE: Dig in, everybody."
"LORELAI: I'm past digging, I'm burrowing. This is delicious."
"SOOKIE: Tri-tip on the barbecue, you can't b*at it. Oh! (to Jackson) Hey, you turn the barbecue off?"
"JACKSON: The barbecue is off."
"LORELAI: Good stuff, huh?"
"LUKE: Really good."
"JACKSON: Thanks. Excuse me. (yelling) Davey, turn the volume down!"
"LUKE: The vegetables are good, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Thanks, Luke. (yelling) Davey, you heard your father. Turn it down!"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'll turn it down."
"SOOKIE: No, we want Davey to do it."
"JACKSON: That's how he learns. (to Davey) You heard me, son. Turn it down."
"SOOKIE: (screeching) Turn it down!"
"JACKSON: Right now."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, I need a lemon slice. (picks up her glass and gets up and walks to the kitchen)"
"JACKSON: So did anybody see that new show on TV last night?"
"LORELAI: The one where they were solving crimes by cutting bodies open and poking their organs?"
"JACKSON: No."
"SOOKIE: The one where they're solving crimes from 30 years ago by going to graveyards and cutting open bodies and poking their organs?"
"JACKSON: No."
"LORELAI: OH! The one where people are missing, and they find their bodies, and cut them open, and poke their organs, and that's how they solve crimes?"
"JACKSON: No."
"LORELAI: What else is on?"
"JACKSON: (shouting) You gotta turn the TV down, son!"
"LORELAI: Are you sure you don't want me to..."
"JACKSON: He's got to learn. (shouting) You heard me, son! Volume down!"
"SOOKIE: (from kitchen screeching) Volume down!"
"JACKSON: Listen to your mother! (voice back to normal volume) What's that show I'm thinking of?"
"SOOKIE: (walking back toward the table) I'm back. (sits down) You like the squash, Luke?"
"JACKSON: Oh, this is gonna bug me."
"LUKE: I'm not a big fan of the squash."
"SOOKIE: OH! I forgot the pepper flakes. (gets up again)"
"LORELAI: Sookie, your food's getting cold."
"JACKSON: (to Luke) I thought you liked squash."
"LUKE: Nope."
"JACKSON: What's that vegetable I thought you liked? (Luke looks at him unfazed)"
"LORELAI: Hey Sookie, do you have a fork for Paul Anka? He likes his own fork. Uh, plastic preferred."
"SOOKIE: Got one here."
"JACKSON: Oh, now this is gonna bug me! What is that vegetable?"
"SOOKIE: The plastic's too high for me to reach. It's up there."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'll get it. You have to eat. (gets up and takes Sookie's plate with her to the kitchen)"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, what's that smell?"
"JACKSON: Oh, man, I left the barbecue on."
"SOOKIE: We cannot set this place on fire, too. I have had enough fires this week."
"JACKSON: I'll get it. (get up from the table and as he walks past the TV) Turn the volume down, Davey. I'm not gonna tell you twice."
"LORELAI: Here you go. It's nice and lean, the way you like it. (gives PA a treat)"
"SOOKIE: Dog who doesn't like fat. That's just weird."
"LORELAI: He's not weird. He's trying to maintain his bathing-suit figure."
"SOOKIE: So, speaking of my least favourite word in the world, fire. Where are we with the insurance company?"
"LORELAI: Uh, nowhere. I got the same run-around they gave Michel."
"SOOKIE: Then let's just do the work. Forget the insurance. Give me back my kitchen."
"LORELAI: Tom's all ready to jump in, but we can't afford to do it without the insurance money. That's why we have insurance."
"SOOKIE: We have stupid insurance. I mean, this policy, wasn't it set up by your..."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: So if we're getting the run-around does it mean that you have to...?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: Sorry."
"LORELAI: I know. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I'll call him tomorrow."
"JACKSON: (as he walk back in a baby starts crying) Barbecue's off."
"SOOKIE: Martha's up."
"JACKSON: (walks out of the room again) I'm on it. Turn the TV down, Davey."
"SOOKIE: Turn it down. You heard us. Turn it down. I'm gonna count to 10, Davey. Then the TV is going off for the rest of the week.10...9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...(as Sookie is counting down Lorelai notices Luke sitting alone at the table eating his food)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, night. Emily and Richard are sitting in the living room each respectively reading a book. While Richard looks completely absorbed in what he's reading, Emily seems to have other things on her mind)"
"EMILY: She threw out the menu."
"RICHARD: (distracted) Hmm?"
"EMILY: Rory. She's changed the entire menu."
"RICHARD: What menu?"
"EMILY: Richard, listen when I talk to you."
"RICHARD: I'm sorry, Emily. It takes a second to emerge from Samuel Beckett. He's a strange man. (takes off his glasses and closes his book) Go on."
"EMILY: Rory threw out the entire menu for the Fort Drum event. I mean, granted, Constance was going with Cornish game hen, been there, done that. And her fetish for Brussels sprouts is upsetting. But to throw out the entire menu? So close to the event?"
"RICHARD: I can't say that I'm a big fan of DAR cuisine. So I may not be of much help."
"EMILY: I'm trying not to butt in, but how can I not worry?"
"RICHARD: (puts on his glasses and re-opens his book) By not thinking about it."
"EMILY: Is there still a USO?"
"RICHARD: I think so. Why?"
"EMILY: That's the theme, the USO. Or that's where it's being held. Oh, my god, she didn't change the menu and the location? Is that possible?"
"RICHARD: You should ask her."
"EMILY: I'm trying to keep out of it."
"RICHARD: You're doing a terrific job."
"EMILY: She's not serving salmon puffs."
"RICHARD: (shuts his book a bit irritated) Good night, Mr.Beckett. (turns his attention to Emily)"
"EMILY: We've never not served salmon puffs. Not in 25 years have we staged an event without salmon puffs."
"RICHARD: Emily, please. It's Rory. What she tackles, she conquers. This girl could name the state capitals at three. Recite the periodic table at four. Discuss Schopenhauer's influence on Nietzsche when she was ten. She's read every book by every author with a Russian surname and had a 4.2 grade-point average at one of the toughest schools on the east coast. If she's excluding salmon puffs, she has a good reason to exclude salmon puffs. And I, for one, have complete confidence in her ability to tackle this job, and so should you."
"EMILY: Fine, go back to your Beckett."
"RICHARD: (goes back to reading his book) Thank you."
"EMILY: (wistful) Salmon puffs."
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, morning. Sookie is instructing her crew. Lorelai looks on)"
"SOOKIE: We'll show 'em. Huh, guys!? (pats one of the assistant chefs on the chest) We'll show 'em, you don't need fancy stuff like stoves in order to make a delicious meal. We've got salads. Lots and lots of salads, caprese and endive and arugula and...Ooh! Cold sandwiches. And beef carpaccio and tuna carpaccio and vegetable carpaccio and...(to Lorelai) Oh, my God. I need my frigging stove back. I'm dying here!"
"LORELAI: Okay, hang in there, hon. (to kitchen crew) Thanks. (as the crew starts to exit Richard walks in the kitchen with another man)"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, I hope it's all right walking in like this. I knew where the kitchen was, so I just figured I'd come back. Sookie."
"SOOKIE: You're our knight in shining armor, Mr.Gilmore."
"RICHARD: (indicating the man he brought along) This is Harris. He'll do the inspection, get the lay of the land. Shouldn't take long. (to Harris) Go ahead and start. (Harris walks over to the stove. To Lorelai and Sookie) I should apologize for the red tape and the delay. As a rule, we don't take on small accounts like this, except under extraordinary circumstances. Until the news reached my desk, no one was sure of what to do."
"LORELAI: Uh huh."
"RICHARD: I can write you a check today. I figured that would please you."
"LORELAI: Terrific."
"SOOKIE: I'm going to go call Tom and see if he can race right over here and start the work. (to Richard) Bless you, sir. You're my golden god. (Sookie leaves. Lorelai and Richard seem uncomfortable as Harris goes on with the inspection)"
"LORELAI: So, um, how's your big plan working out?"
"RICHARD: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Oh, your big plan for Rory. How's that going, Dad?"
"RICHARD: Let me know if you need anything, Harris."
"LORELAI: Is she back at Yale?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai..."
"LORELAI: oh, I take it she's not."
"RICHARD: No, she's not."
"LORELAI: Huh. But it's in the works?"
"RICHARD: We'll be here ten minutes."
"LORELAI: No, wait! Let me guess. You're gonna trick her into going back, right? Like you'll drive up and drop her off at Yale, then you'll drive away really quickly before she catches on. Is that one of the plans?"
"RICHARD: (staring to get mad) Is there anything I can do to expedite this, Harris?"
"LORELAI: You see that family of Logan's recently. The...Hamburgers?"
"RICHARD: Huntzbergers."
"LORELAI: Right, right. How are the old Huntzbergers? They behaving any better than that night they humiliated your granddaughter?"
"RICHARD: They did not humiliate her."
"LORELAI: Rory said they did."
"RICHARD: I know the Huntzbergers. They're fine people. What happened that night was a misunderstanding, because they have nothing against Rory."
"LORELAI: No?"
"RICHARD: Why would they?"
"LORELAI: Ask them!"
"RICHARD: It's not true!"
"LORELAI: Well, then that granddaughter of yours, what a liar."
"RICHARD: Harris, take a couple of pictures and we'll go. (to Lorelai) We just need the quote from your contractor in writing. Send all his bills directly to me."
"LORELAI: Will do."
"RICHARD: Goodbye. (he exits. Harris takes one last picture and follows him)"
"LORELAI: (to the, now, empty kitchen) It's been lovely."
"(CUT to pool house, morning. Rory is planning the event with the assistance of three more people)"
"RORY: What about silverware?"
"GLENDA: I can get you 1940s, the real thing. It's plates though. Plates are a toughie."
"LACEY: Plates break."
"GLENDA: I can get you a couple of dozen, hand-painted, not 100."
"RORY: So, what's our best bet? An off-white, new, but made to look vintage?"
"LANCE: Off-white would be super."
"RORY: They should be heavy, right? Solid?"
"GLENDA: Oh, my servers are gonna love that."
"RORY: Then not too heavy. Lacey, get me samples of all this?"
"LACEY: Will do."
"RORY: Now, there must be a colour photo of the Hollywood Canteen. I mean, we've checked the Internet. The library?"
"LACEY: The Getty in California has one in their collection, but they're very flaky on the phone."
"RORY: Ugh, California."
"LANCE: I'm so over the west coast."
"RORY: A bunch of granola heads. (a cell phone rings. Lacey answers)"
"LACEY: Rory Gilmore's phone...Who's calling?...One moment, please. (to Rory) It's Logan Huntzberger."
"RORY: I'll take that. (takes the phone from Lacey) Hello?"
"LOGAN: (he's at Yale. The scene switches between Rory at the pool house and Logan at school) Oh, my God. Who was that?"
"RORY: My assistant. I forwarded my phone to hers."
"LOGAN: You have an assistant?"
"RORY: Just for this DAR thing. I get a million calls."
"LOGAN: well I consider myself lucky to be patched through."
"RORY: You have priority clearance."
"LOGAN: So, good news. I got the PA system you wanted at the price you wanted."
"RORY: Really? Oh, cool. Lacey, PA system: Done."
"LACEY: Excellent."
"RORY: (to Logan on phone) That's great."
"LOGAN: This guy's done the sound at every party I've ever thrown. He's the best in the business."
"RORY: (there is a knock at the door. It's Paris) And, oh, goody. Paris is here. And she looks upset."
"LOGAN: That and a bulldozer would knock me over."
"PARIS: Excuse me? The door is locked."
"LACEY: (to Rory) Do you know her?"
"RORY: Let her in, then hide. (to Logan on phone) I'll call you later."
"LOGAN: Bye. (hangs up)"
"PARIS: (as Lacey opens the door for her, in mock Lacey voice) ""Do you know her?"". (back to normal voice) I'm only her best friend. Who the hell are you?"
"RORY: Paris, come here. Calm down. (Paris walks over to her) What's wrong?"
"PARIS: I'm broke."
"RORY: Broke? How?"
"PARIS: My parents flipped the bird at the IRS one too many times. They've frozen everything. All I've got is my trust fund, which doesn't kick in till I'm twenty-five. Unless you can whip out a magic wand and age me four years, I'm a goner."
"RORY: Just, sit down. Calm down. (lead her to the couch where they sit)"
"PARIS: My ATM refused me. I thought it was just that particular one. So I went to another, and it refused me, too. So I went to the bank and used a few choice expletives, and a bunch of guys in suits started closing in on me. So I started pacing and yelling, ""Attica! Attica!"", and then the manager hit a little red button under his desk, so I ran out of there and came right over here. I'm a pauper. I'll be playing a hurdy gurdy on street corners and selling pencils out of a tin cup."
"RORY: Slow down."
"PARIS: Yale's paid for, through the end of the year, thank God. But...what'll I do about everything else I need? What'll I do?"
"RORY: You'll just have to do what everyone else who needs money has to do."
"PARIS: What's that?"
"RORY: What people do."
"PARIS: What am I, a mind reader?"
"RORY: Get a job."
"PARIS: A job? I've never had a job. I don't know the first thing about having a job. All I've got on my resume is academic achievements, which will mean doodly-squat when I'm in line with 11,000 people vying for an opening in the garden department at Wal-Mart."
"RORY: Paris, wait. As you said, Yale's paid for. That's the bright side. From now on, you'll just have to keep your expenses low. And I could get you some work. Right away. How would that be?"
"PARIS: Really?"
"RORY: Yes. I know you'll be a hard worker. That's a given."
"PARIS: I definitely would be. And, you know I speak Chinese and Farsi, if that'll help."
"RORY: Well, I need servers for the food. You could do that, right?"
"PARIS: I think so."
"RORY: See? You're on the road to recovery."
"PARIS: Oh, thanks. (they get up and Paris approaches Glenda, Lacey and the guy) And I'll work my butt off, too, Glenda. Oh, and I know a smattering of ancient Aramaic, if that helps."
"GLENDA: It could."
"LANCE: If Christ shows up."
"PARIS: And who are you?"
"RORY: Go home, Paris. You've had a rough day."
"PARIS: I guess."
"RORY: I'll call you with the details."
"PARIS: Thanks. (walks over to Rory and whispers) Hey, uh, can you spot me a 20..."
"RORY: Sure."
"PARIS: (whispering) ...5, 25?"
"RORY: (grabs some cash and gives it to Paris) Um, here you go."
"PARIS: Thanks. (she leaves)"
"RORY: (approaching the three assistants) I owe you more than you currently realize. Okay, where were we?"
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, night. Luke is cooking as Lorelai walks in)"
"LORELAI: Mmm."
"LUKE: Pasta's almost done, sauce is close, too."
"LORELAI: Luke, you could have just used the store-bought sauce I have. (starts to lay the table)"
"LUKE: Ugh, that stuff is junk."
"LORELAI: (insulted) It's delicious Italian sauce."
"LUKE: OK, first off, it's not. Second, all you had was four already-opened jars, two of which I couldn't get the lids off of."
"LORELAI: Somebody needs some gym time,"
"LUKE: And one of them had a layer of white fuzz on it."
"LORELAI: That was a little gross."
"LUKE: And the last one, green fuzz."
"LORELAI: Also gross."
"LUKE: I make better, just like mama taught me."
"LORELAI: I know you do. How's Paul Anka's dinner coming?"
"LUKE: His hamburger's close, too."
"LORELAI: You're not overcooking it, (Luke walks over to the fridge) 'cause, you know, he likes it rare plus, you know, not too rare, but not medium rare."
"LUKE: (picks up a flier from the fridge) I'm cooking it to his exacting specifications. (read the flier) Miss Patty's having a recital?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. It's her big annual show. All her kids in all her classes get to perform. It's be there or be square. Best show in town."
"LUKE: It's a Thursday, right? That's a good night. I can have Caesar close for me."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: So I can go with you."
"LORELAI: Oh, no. Luke, you're not going to this recital."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because it's a night of kids dancing, singing, twirling batons. You'll hate it."
"LUKE: No, I won't."
"LORELAI: Yes, you will."
"LUKE: Not my first choice in entertainment, but I'll go."
"LORELAI: Luke, no. You have been sacrificing too much of yourself these past few months. You go with me to my movies, you tag along when I go shopping. And that dinner at Sookie and Jackson's...how you kept from k*ll us all, I'll never know."
"LUKE: I haven't been complaining about any of this."
"LORELAI: I know, and that has filled me with no end of guilt. You've been a saint, but you've got to do your Luke stuff, too. When was the last time you went camping or fishing?"
"LUKE: You don't like camping or fishing."
"LORELAI: That shouldn't stop you from camping or fishing."
"LUKE: I'd go if I felt like it."
"LORELAI: Well, then go Thursday while I'm at the recital. I'll go with Sookie. It'll be fun with her."
"LUKE: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Yeah! Go. You haven't been camping in forever. Be Grizzly Adams."
"LUKE: Okay, sure, I'll go camping."
"LORELAI: (approaches Luke at the stove) Good. (notices something in a pan, PA's dinner) Oh, it's officially..."
"LUKE: Oh, medium rare, not rare plus. I'll get him another. (Luke takes the hamburger out of the pan and prepares another)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion dining room, night. Richard, Emily and Rory are having dinner. Richard attempts to engage the women in some conversation but Rory seems distracted)"
"RICHARD: Well, I don't know why I bother. The great books take practically a lifetime to read as it is. But if you heed the word of Mortimer Adler, one needs to read a classic three times to fully comprehend its meaning."
"RORY: (distracted) Yeah."
"RICHARD: I wonder if Mortimer ever read ""Euclid's geometry"" three times. That's a fun read. Have you read ""Euclid's geometry""?"
"RORY: (not any less distracted) Me? No."
"RICHARD: It doesn't get any drier. What have you been reading lately? I keep forgetting to ask. (makes a gesture to answer but instead starts texting someone with her cell phone)"
"EMILY: Rory?"
"RORY: Sorry, guys. The event's right around the corner, and I just keep thinking of things I have to do. I'm just texting Lacey."
"EMILY: So how's that going?"
"RORY: Good, really good."
"EMILY: Good. Did Lacey mention the partitions?"
"RORY: (still texting) Partitions?"
"EMILY: At Wafford Hall. It's so big, and these partitions can cut the room wherever you like so it won't look so empty. They're not very decorative, but they work."
"RORY: Hold on just a second. (end texting and puts the phone down) Partitions?"
"EMILY: For the room."
"RORY: But we won't have any room. We're sold out."
"EMILY: Sold out? That's not possible."
"RORY: Oh, it's a fact. The theme got people's attention. Plus, the online campaign went like gangbusters. We're having to turn people away. That's what I was texting Lacey about. I'm trying to squeeze in a few more, but we're fighting the fire department over it."
"EMILY: (disbelieving and impressed) You're turning people away?"
"RORY: But still encouraging them to give a sizable donation to our boys."
"RICHARD: Brilliant."
"EMILY: (brightly) Sold out!"
"RICHARD: (to Rory) I knew you could do it!"
"EMILY: Good job!"
"RORY: Thank you."
"EMILY: Continue texting."
"RORY: Oh, thank you. (picks up her phone again as Richard and Emily continue eating)"
""

"(CUT to Wafford Hall-venue for the DAR event, morning. Workers are setting up tables and decorations while Rory is walking through the hall thinking she's talking to someone when in reality she's talking to thin air)"
"RORY: Oh, when the band gets here, grab Gerry and get them to do a sound check. Make sure they're happy with the sound. Not just cheery, because...(turns around and sees nobody there) Lacey? Where's my Lacey?"
"LACEY: (runs towards Rory) Here."
"RORY: Come on, honey, keep up."
"LACEY: I spotted the security guard, so I filled him in."
"RORY: Excellent. Cross that off the list. Servers are here?"
"LACEY: Got them all waiting in the back."
"RORY: Excellent! (as they start walking to the kitchen Rory addresses two guys putting up a poster) Wow! Treat her gently there, boys. Betty's life was tough enough."
"(CUT to Wafford Hall's kitchen, continuous. There is a bunch of people waiting. Rory walks in and sees Paris)"
"RORY: Hey, Paris."
"PARIS: Rory, I clocked in."
"RORY: Cool!"
"PARIS: They gave me this card, and it had my name on it. And I shoved it in the clock thing, and it made the punchy sound, and I'm officially on the job."
"RORY: Great!"
"PARIS: And I'm prepared too. I was a little nervous last night about making small talk with co-workers. So I went to the video store and rented ""Working Girl"" and the first season of ""Just sh**t Me"". Got a couple of Wendie Malick bon mots that have already come in handy."
"RORY: Very good. Welcome."
"PARIS: Thanks, boss."
"RORY: I'm gonna welcome the whole group here."
"PARIS: No problem. (Rory walks past Paris and addresses the rest of the crowd. Paris stands behind Rory)"
"RORY: Hello. You must be my servers. I'm Rory Gilmore. I'm running this little shindig. How are all of you today?"
"SERVERS: Good. Great."
"RORY: You all come highly recommended by Glenda, our catering manager, so I know you're all top notch..."
"PARIS: (cuts Rory off and walks up front) Yeah, super. Looks like a good group. Good group."
"RORY: (whispering to Paris) Um, you know, you should probably be standing over with the others."
"PARIS: Oh, right. I'm one of them. Got it. Sorry. (walks over to the rest of the group)"
"RORY: (to the whole group) So it's going to be hard work tonight. We have 100 people dining with us. But I want you to have fun, too. We have your outfits on a rack over here. Your name should be on them. It's a good cause, so let's get changed and go do. (walks away)"
"PARIS: (to one of the other servers) So, working hard or hardly working? (the girl giggles) Oh, my, oh, my. I love it! (the whole group approaches the rack to get their outfits)"
"(CUT to Miss Patty's, night. The studio is filled with people. Sookie and Lorelai walk in and approach the lady passing out the programs. They each take one)"
"SOOKIE: (as she takes a program) Hey, thanks."
"LORELAI: (as she takes a program) Thank you."
"SOOKIE: So where's Luke tonight?"
"LORELAI: As we speak, he's off communing with nature."
"SOOKIE: Oh, good for him. (they sit)"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: (reading from the program) Ooh, the ballerinas are doing ""Swan Lake"". That always makes me cry."
"LORELAI: (opens the program) Oh, Patty's packed it all in. Baton twirling, a modelling exhibition. She's added a couple new features, too."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, what's krumping?"
"LORELAI: Um, like hip-hop dance, I think, more herky-jerky."
"SOOKIE: And what is pubic speaking?"
"LORELAI: I'm hoping it's a misprint."
"SOOKIE: I hope so, too."
"PATTY: (declaring the start of the show. Everyone is now seated) Welcome, everybody, to the 28th Annual Miss Patty's School Grand Recital. (the audience applauds) Thank you. We have a lot on the program tonight. So, without further ado, please welcome my intermediate pupils as they welcome you. Hit it, boys. (a young boy in a blue outfit and a hat comes on stage as the piano starts to play)"
"LORELAI: She always does a fun opening number."
"(the boy starts singing the song ""We've Got Magic To Do"")"
"LORELAI: Isn't he cute?"
"SOOKIE: Darling."
"(as he keeps up with the song a bunch of kids join him. They are taking the show off the stage and in the audience. All the kids are dancing and singing)"
"SOOKIE: Uh-oh, they're in the audience."
"LORELAI: Oh! I...I hate it when they come into the audience. Okay. Yeah... (the kids start gesturing vividly in front of Lorelai and Sookie's faces) This is...this is not good."
"(the kids continue their act and start throwing glitter out to the audience. They hit Sookie and Lorelai with a great amount of it. The women react)"
"LORELAI: AAH!"
"SOOKIE: OH!"
"LORELAI: Blowing stuff on us! (the kids continue on with their show, into the audience)"
"(CUT to Wafford Hall, night. The event is just staring up. Some guests have arrived. There is a band that are impersonating the Andrews Sisters, who are singing on stage. Rory and Lacey walk around the hall doing last minute inspections)"
"RORY: People seem hungry tonight. Tell..."
"LACEY: ...Glenda to speed the trays up a bit."
"RORY: Yeah, and let the sound guy know..."
"LACEY: ...that the drums are a little loud."
"RORY: And it's a tad warm."
"LACEY: Already had them adjust the AC."
"RORY: Any incoming choppers, radar?"
"LACE: Choppers? No. What do you mean?"
"RORY: That was a joke, Lacey."
"LACEY: Oh. Sorry."
"RORY: You're a doll. Remember to have a little fun tonight, too."
"LACEY: Will do...Radar. I get it now. That was funny. I'll be back. (Lacey walks briskly away, Rory follows. Paris approaches a guest with a tray of appetizers)"
"PARIS: (offering the tray) Appetizers?"
"GUEST: Oh, thank you. (takes an appetizer and eats it)"
"PARIS: You're welcome. So how was that?"
"GUEST: It was fine, very good."
"PARIS: I meant the transaction. I'd love a performance review. Come on, be my Dave Navarro."
"GUEST: (a bit uncomfortable) Um, you were fine."
"PARIS: I'm gonna need more. It was T.S. Eliot who said criticism is as inevitable as breathing and said that we should be none the worse for articulating what passes in our mind when we read a book, see a play or, now I'm elaborating, pass a cheddar and olive ball. I need some feedback."
"GUEST: Really, you offered it to me well, and all seemed great, and I don't want to talk about this anymore."
"PARIS: Good. Thank you, this has been a help. (walks away from the guest. Emily and Richard have now arrived at the event. The hostess welcomes them at the door)"
"HOSTESS: Welcome to the Hollywood Canteen."
"RICHARD: Thank you. We're the Gilmores."
"EMILY: (impressed) Richard, look at this place!"
"RICHARD: It's wonderful."
"HOSTESS: Here is your table number. And take a pin, both of you."
"RICHARD: Oh, thank you."
"EMILY: Yeah, thank you. (they enter the hall properly now) Oh, I love this song. And look at the band. It's the Andrews Sisters."
"RICHARD: They've kept in pretty good shape. (Rory walks up to the G-parents)"
"RORY: Hi, guys."
"RICHARD: Aw! Looks like you've got a hit on your hands."
"RORY: So far, so good. No one's dancing, though."
"EMILY: Oh, it's early. You'll see plenty of dancing after dinner."
"RICHARD: You'll see some dancing right now."
"EMILY: Richard, it's before dinner. There's no dancing during appetizers."
"RICHARD: Come on, let's show these fuddy-duddies how it's done. (leads Emily to the dance floor and they start dancing, as Rory looks at them smiling)"
"(CUT to woods, night. Luke is sitting alone at the campsite in front of a fire. He looks sad, upset and miserable)"
"(CUT to Wafford Hall, night. It's now dinnertime. Richard, Emily and Nancy are at the same table deep in conversation)"
"RICHARD: My father was a huge Benny Goodman fan. Hated Glenn Miller, hated him. Always claimed it wasn't the enemy who sh*t down that plane of his, but music lovers."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard, that's a horrible thing to say."
"RICHARD: It was my father who said it."
"EMILY: But you just repeated it. (Rory approaches their table) Here's the woman of the hour."
"RICHARD: Ah!"
"RORY: How's the food, everybody?"
"NANCY: The macaroni and cheese, what an inspiration!"
"RICHARD: Rory, please accept my profound thanks for serving food at a DAR event which is remarkably edible."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard. We always have good food."
"RICHARD: You have fancy good food. If I never look at another duck's liver for the rest of my life, I will be a happy man. (Lacey, come up to Rory a bit upset)"
"LACEY: Rory, could I pull you away for just a second?"
"RORY: Sure. Excuse me, everybody. (the girls walk away)"
"NANCY: She's so poised...like you, Emily."
"LACEY: A party's arrived. I'm looking, looking. They did not RSVP, but they're expecting a table."
"RORY: Oh, great. Where are they?"
"LACEY: By the w*r bonds table. It's Shira Huntzberger. She waltzed in with a group of ladies in tow and made it clear she expected to be accommodated."
"RORY: (starting to get worked up) Did she?"
"LACEY: And not very nicely either."
"RORY: (sarcastically) Oh, what a shock."
"LACEY: But you know her, right? That's your boyfriend's mother."
"RORY: Yeah, yeah, I know her."
"LACEY: I didn't mean to insult her before. She was just very abrupt."
"RORY: It's OK. I'll take care of it."
"LACEY: (passes Rory a piece of paper) Here's the seating chart."
"RORY: Thanks. (takes the seating chart and exits to the kitchen)"
"(CUT to Wafford Hall's kitchen, continuous. Rory enters and Paris is there working)"
"PARIS: Hey, boss. It's interesting, you know. Karl Marx has come alive for me today. I never understood what he was yammering about before, and now it just seems so obviously wrong that those who control capital should make their fortunes off the labour of the working class. What's wrong with you?"
"RORY: Shira Huntzberger is here."
"PARIS: Logan's mom?"
"RORY: And she showed up with no warning. No RSVP, no donation to the cause that I know of. Just sashayed in, expecting everyone to fall at her feet."
"PARIS: I hate that."
"RORY: I hate her. Hate! Strong, unadulterated, blind...Uurrghh!"
"PARIS: Wow. You're always so Desmond Tutu-ey. This is refreshing."
"RORY: I should tell her to leave. I should march up to her and tell her to grab those arrogance-dripping, petulance-oozing, surgically cosmeticized bims she brought along and hit the bricks."
"PARIS: I bet they all have money, too. Every one of those commodity fetishists."
"RORY: How can she expect a table? The tables are for the people who are polite enough to respond to an invitation in the proper manner."
"PARIS: I bet you the Romanovs never RSVP'd either. They got theirs. Capitalist scum."
"RORY: I hate her!"
"PARIS: I hate the rich. A hard rain is gonna fall, you know what I'm saying?"
"RORY: I really hate her!"
"PARIS: They should die."
"RORY: I should probably give her a table."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Well, we have a spare table. We kept it open in case of something like this. I should give it to her."
"PARIS: But she doesn't deserve it."
"RORY: I know, but this is business. It's not personal. I should give her that table."
"PARIS: Fine. Whatever you think. You're the boss. Hey, boss, how much are you being paid in this job of yours? (Rory looks at Paris for a b*at and then walks way)"
"(CUT to main Hall, continuous. Rory walks out of the kitchen, takes a second to calm down and approaches Shira and her party. The whole conversation seems to be held in forced politeness)"
"RORY: Mrs. Huntzberger."
"SHIRA: Rory, hi! What are you doing here?"
"RORY: I'm running this event."
"SHIRA: I didn't know."
"RORY: Well, now you do."
"SHIRA: I think I've been bad."
"RORY: Oh, really? Why?"
"SHIRA: I just showed up without any warning. I didn't think I could come, so I didn't call. Then I could, and the group and I just came down."
"RORY: It happens."
"SHIRA: That's what I told that other girl. She was a bit rude."
"RORY: Lacey? I'll talk to her."
"SHIRA: Could you get us a table?"
"RORY: Of course. Come."
"SHIRA: It's not a problem?"
"RORY: Oh! Not at all. (leads Shira and the ladies that accompany her to a table) Come with me. It's all set up."
"SHIRA: Oh, you are the best."
"RORY: It's just my job."
"SHIRA: So no Logan?"
"RORY: Not tonight."
"SHIRA: Not his thing?"
"RORY: Oh, you know Logan. Here we are."
"SHIRA: Thank you so much. (as she sits down) And you look so pretty."
"RORY: So do you. Have a good time."
"SHIRA: I'm sure we will. (Rory walks away upset)"
"(CUT to Wafford Hall's bar. Richard, Emily and Vivian are having drinks and talking)"
"VIVIAN: You've created a superstar here tonight, Emily. I hope you know that."
"EMILY: Well, yes, I do."
"VIVIAN: There's already talk of giving her the A.A."
"RICHARD: An A.A?"
"VIVIAN: An Abigail Adams, for distinguished service above and beyond."
"EMILY: She deserves it."
"VIVIAN: She's made this a must-be-at event. I'm guessing that's what brought Shira here."
"EMILY: (excited) Shira? Shira Huntzberger's here?"
"VIVIAN: Rumsfeld, himself, would probably call her and thank her for the donation she made on the way in. Hillbilly armor will be a thing of the past."
"EMILY: Where is she sitting?"
"VIVIAN: Up front. The table by the band."
"EMILY: (shocked) Oh, my God!"
"RICHARD: (confused) What?"
"EMILY: Oh, my god. Excuse me. (Emily rushes off over to Rory at the other end of the bar) Rory, where's the seating chart?"
"RORY: What? Why?"
"EMILY: There's been a terrible mistake."
"RORY: What mistake?"
"EMILY: You sat Shira Huntzberger at the slush table."
"RORY: It was all that was available."
"EMILY: The slush table is a loser table."
"RORY: But why would we have a loser table?"
"EMILY: It's for people who show up unannounced."
"RORY: (pissy) She was unannounced."
"EMILY: There's people, then there's the Huntzbergers. They cannot sit at that table. This needs to be rectified."
"RORY: I don't know what I can do. Every table is taken."
"EMILY: I'll take care of it. Give me the seating chart. I'll find someone to bump. There's always someone to bump."
"RORY: (opening up the seating chart and passing it to Emily) Grandma, it doesn't seem fair to bump someone."
"EMILY: It's not. But if we don't find better seating for the Huntzbergers, it'll be a major faux pas, and it may be the only thing people remember from this otherwise wonderful event."
"RORY: Wow."
"EMILY: Yes."
"RORY: Well, thank you for helping. And it's not the Huntzbergers."
"EMILY: (distracted by the seating chart) What?"
"RORY: You keep saying ""the Huntzbergers."" It's only Shira and some friends."
"EMILY: And Mitchum."
"RORY: No."
"EMILY: Yes. He's right over there. (points to Mitchum's direction. Rory looks around, notices Mitchum and starts to panic. Emily gasps gleefully) The Bettertons. Perfect! We'll bump Constance Betterton. It's a win/win. (walks away and leaves a scared looking Rory alone. Rory quickly gathers her things and walks away)"
"(CUT to Wafford Hall's kitchen, continuous. Rory walks in quickly and drops her notes on the counter. Paris seems to be taking a break)"
"RORY: (upset) Paris?!"
"PARIS: I'm just on my break. You're white as a sheet."
"RORY: I'm having trouble...breathing."
"PARIS: (walks over to Rory) You're having a panic attack."
"RORY: I think so."
"PARIS: Don't worry. I have these all the time."
"RORY: What do I do?"
"PARIS: Well, it depends. There are different kinds. Does it feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest?"
"RORY: No."
"PARIS: Does your chest feel like an overinflated balloon with a slow leak?"
"RORY: Uum...Not really."
"PARIS: Sharp needles, intermittently poking into your left ventricle?"
"RORY: I don't know from ventricles, but there is a needle thing."
"PARIS: You need Diazepam. 50...no, 100 milligrams. I'll get my purse. (starts to leave)"
"RORY: No, wait. I don't want any Diazepam. (Paris stops and walks back up at Rory)"
"PARIS: Well, what do you want? Fluoxetine, Protriptyline? I have others floating around the bottom of my purse. I have no idea what they are, but just popping a few can't hurt. Pretty hot grab bag"
"RORY: These people...Those people, they didn't even RSVP. That's not right. This is for our boys. They need to make a donation."
"PARIS: (walks closer to Rory) Tough night for you, huh?"
"RORY: Shira's one thing. I can deal with her. But Mitchum? I can't see him. I can't face him. It's too much. After what he did, what he said to me. (voice breaks)"
"PARIS: What did he say to you?"
"RORY: If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have..."
"PARIS: you wouldn't have what? Rory?"
"RORY: Nothing, nothing. He's just...They're just not the nicest people."
"PARIS: Well, the rich never are, because they don't have to be. When you control the means of production, it reduces the incentive to humanize workers. The capitalist system..."
"RORY (cuts Paris off) You know, I haven't eaten all day. I...I think I should eat. That's my problem. (walks away)"
"PARIS: Sure, boss, go eat. There's probably somewhere else where you eat, right? Special room."
"(CUT to Miss Patty's, night. Some girls are on stage dancing ""Swan Lake"". Lorelai and Sookie are watching the show. Sookie is tear eyed)"
"SOOKIE: It's just so damn beautiful."
"LORELAI: (sympathetically) I know, honey. (the dance is over and the audience starts to applaud)"
"PATTY: The Miss Patty Ballerinas, everybody. Now I would like to introduce a special new segment of my annual recital entitled ""It Was 20 Years Ago Today."" One of our local townsmen is going to re-create an act that he performed on this very stage 20 years ago. This young man was a talented pupil of my wonderful dancing k*ll and a genius tumbler. He once did ninety-eight somersaults in a row without throwing up. But that's nothing compared with his talent for mime. Here to present a piece of his own creation, entitled ""The Journey Of Man"", exactly as he performed it 20 years ago is...Kirk! (The audience applauds, Lorelai whistles. The lights go down and creepy, dramatical, mystical music starts to play. Kirk walks on stage and lies down. A spotlight on him is the only thing illuminating the stage)"
"LORELAI: (whispering to Sookie) Oh, it's moments like these that make life worth living. (Kirk starts up with his number. He pretends to be a sperm swimming then an embryo. All this is done in a very Kirk like disturbing manner)"
"LORELAI: Ew."
"SOOKIE: Ew. (the same dramatic music keeps playing, now accompanied by chanting. Kirk is now re-enacting birth)"
"LORELAI: (disgusted) Ew!"
"SOOKIE: (disgusted) Ew! (Kirk does some funny - well not meant to be funny, but they come off that way - faces and gestures as he does that thing where doctors hit the baby's back in order to make it cry)"
"LORELAI: So it's the birth of Lucille Ball? (Kirk is now an infant, walking like he's holding someone?s hand. Slowly he starts to stand up straight and then pretends to hold a bundle. Lorelai gasps!) He's a parent now, I get that."
"SOOKIE: He's moving along at a nice clip. (Lorelai notices Luke's truck at the diner and sees Luke getting out and going back in)"
"LORELAI: I'll be right back."
"SOOKIE: I'll catch you up when you return. (Lorelai gets up and exits the studio)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, continuous. Luke is unpacking his camping stuff. Lorelai knocks on the diner door. Luke walks over, unlocks it for her and walks back to the counter. Lorelai comes in)"
"LORELAI: Hey, Grizzly Adams. Why are you back? The woods closed or something?"
"LUKE: No, they weren't closed. I was...I don't know. It's...what it is. Nature."
"LORELAI: Nature? Nature is..."
"LUKE: You know, it's there, I saw it. Trees, leaves, whatever."
"LORELAI: OK, that's your second answer in the form of a haiku. Let's get beyond that. Why are you back?"
"LUKE: Because I felt like coming back. I can't do what I want to do?"
"LORELAI: Of course you can."
"LUKE: Good."
"LORELAI: But camping is something you want to do."
"LUKE: No, it's what you wanted me to do."
"LORELAI: When did you turn against camping?"
"LUKE: I didn't turn against camping. I'm just trying to understand, why you were trying to get rid of me tonight."
"LORELAI: I wasn't doing that."
"LUKE: Well, you sent me off to the woods. What if I don't want to go off to the woods?"
"LORELAI: But you always want to go to the woods."
"LUKE: Well, I don't like going to the woods when I'm being banished to them."
"LORELAI: No one is banishing you."
"LUKE: It felt like it."
"LORELAI: Well, then, that's my fault. (sits on a nearby stool)"
"LUKE: (sighs) Look... I like doing things with you. Surprised I have to tell you that."
"LORELAI: You don't have to tell me that."
"LUKE: I like going shopping with you, I like having dinner with Sookie and Jackson. The actual shopping seems a little pointless, and Sookie's kids drive me up a wall, but you're there, and I like hanging with you."
"LORELAI: I know that."
"LUKE: And, I could have been fun at this recital. I mean, you're probably sitting there mocking most of it. I can mock stuff."
"LORELAI: Oh, you're a great mocker. I was only thinking of you when I mentioned the camping. You haven't been camping since we got together, and I was feeling weird about that. You should do the things you like."
"LUKE: I do do the things I like."
"LORELAI: Well, I wasn't getting rid of you. I want you to do whatever you want to do with me. I know that sounded dirty, and dirty things count, but I didn't mean the dirty things. You and me can hang whenever, wherever."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, maybe I'm being sensitive."
"LORELAI: I really wasn't getting rid of you."
"LUKE: I mean, I'm not dying to see baton twirling."
"LORELAI: I'm happy to be with a man who isn't."
"LUKE: Was there baton twirling?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, and it was no fun. She didn't drop it once. You want to come back to the recital with me? Kirk is doing something strange and disturbing."
"LUKE: Nah, I think I might go back out camping. Wouldn't mind doing some fishing."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: Yeah. Good."
"LORELAI: OK. (Lorelai leaves and Luke turns back his focus to his camping equipment)"
"(CUT to Miss Patty's Studio, continuous. Kirk is now lying on the stage and he seems to be in some sort of fit. Lorelai enters and makes her way to her seat)"
"LORELAI: Excuse me. Thank you. Hey."
"SOOKIE: Kirk's dying."
"LORELAI: Oh. Well, it's gonna happen to all of us one day. (notices Kirk twitching all over the place) Just not so spazzy. (Kirk finally seems to have *died* and the music stops. The audience starts applauding and cheering)"
"PATTY: And that's our show, everybody, and I think it was the best one ever! From all of us at the Miss Patty School, we thank you. (everyone starts to get up as music starts playing again. It's ""We Got Magic To Do"" now performed by all the pupils. The show is taken in the audience so everyone sits back down)"
"SOOKIE: (disappointed) OOooohh..."
"LORELAI: They're back. (as one of the kids starts singing and gesturing in front of her face) OK. (they throw glitter at them again) Oh, wow! You'd think they would have run out of glitter by now."
"SOOKIE: This is so stressful! (the show seems to go on until the song is over)"
"(CUT to Wafford Hall's men?s room, night. Richard is washing his hands. Apparently the DAR event is still going on. Mitchum walks in the men?s room and greats Richard)"
"MITCHUM: Richard."
"RICHARD: Oh, Mitchum, old boy. I didn't know you were out there."
"MITCHUM: Just got here. It's quite the affair we got going here."
"RICHARD: And for a wonderful cause."
"MITCHUM: Not stuffy like the others. No smell of mothballs."
"RICHARD: Well you know my granddaughter is responsible for it."
"MITCHUM: Oh, yeah?"
"RICHARD: Mmm. Planned the whole thing."
"MITCHUM: Well, that's nice. I didn't know that. She's a sweet kid."
"RICHARD: The sweetest."
"MITCHUM: Yeah. I wish Rory nothing but the best. (walks over to the mirror and starts fixing his hair a bit and straightening his tie) I came straight from work without looking in a mirror. Wish I had."
"RICHARD: (chuckles) Mitchum, just out of curiosity, what happened with all of that?"
"MITCHUM: All of what?"
"RICHARD: Uh, that paper of yours in Stanford. Something apparently got blown out of proportion. There was some misunderstanding."
"MITCHUM: Oh, it was nothing much. She's a great kid."
"RICHARD: She is. And a great journalist. I've read things she's written. She's a talent."
"MITCHUM: Maybe."
"RICHARD: What do you mean ""maybe""?"
"MITCHUM: well, I worked with her, Richard. I read her stuff, too."
"RICHARD: Meaning?"
"MITCHUM: I've read great. I know what great is."
"RICHARD: Well, when I said great, I didn't mean she was Ben Bradley yet, but she could be."
"MITCHUM: (looks over at Richard for a b*at) Anything's possible. (starts to walk away)"
"RICHARD: What exactly happened at that paper, Mitchum? (walks over to Mitchum)"
"MITCHUM: It didn't work out, Richard. It was just one of those things. She's better off for what I did."
"RICHARD: And what exactly did you do?"
"MITCHUM: Nothing you wouldn't have done."
"RICHARD: Oh? And what was that?"
"MITCHUM: You're in the business world. You have employees, yes?"
"RICHARD: Of course."
"MITCHUM: Say you got a guy working in your office. You brought him in. Nice guy, everybody loves him, but he just doesn't have it. He's a drain on the company. What are you gonna do?"
"RICHARD: My granddaughter was not a drain on your company."
"MITCHUM: My point is that I wasn't going to put her in a position to become a drain. Now, Richard, really, we should get back out there."
"RICHARD: What did you say to her?"
"MITCHUM: Richard...!"
"RICHARD: (persistent) what did you say to her, Mitchum?"
"MITCHUM: I did what I do with everyone. I called it like I saw it. I was honest with her. I don't pussyfoot. You know that."
"RICHARD: You crushed her."
"MITCHUM: And if she's got what it takes, she'll bounce back. No one's every criticized you, reprimanded you, critiqued you? I find that hard to believe."
"RICHARD: (staring to raise his voice) This is not about me."
"MITCHUM: She was in over her head. She lacked maturity."
"RICHARD: She's not even 21!"
"MITCHUM: Look, just blame me, OK? I felt bad that she had to sit through that disastrous dinner with Shira and Pop, going on about marriage and how she can't become a Huntzberger. I don't care about any of that, so I gave her a sh*t, and she wasn't up to it."
"RICHARD: (clearly upset) You crushed that girl!"
"MITCHUM: I did what I do. We should have done this on the phone. (Richard walks out of the room angrily)"
"(CUT to main Hall, continuous. The band is still singing. Richard walks up to Emily upset)"
"EMILY: Richard, there you are. This is one of your favourites, and you're missing it."
"RICHARD: It's all true, all of it."
"EMILY: What's true?"
"RICHARD: Everything she told us. Everything!"
"EMILY: ?Everything? who told us?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai. About what Mitchum did to Rory. How he said things to her, crushed her. About Logan's whole family!"
"EMILY: (disbelievingly) That can't be."
"RICHARD: (frustrated) Mitchum just confirmed everything. He told that girl she wasn't good enough. I ought to punch him!"
"EMILY: Richard, calm down. People will hear."
"RICHARD: They don't want her marrying into their precious family. They don't think she's good enough. He told her that she didn't have it. And you know she does! I know she does!"
"EMILY: Of course she does."
"RICHARD: I can't stay in this room with these people."
"EMILY: Richard, go outside, get some air."
"RICHARD: We should go home."
"EMILY: I'll catch up with you. Go outside."
"RICHARD: (mad) Yeah, yeah. (Richard walks away. Emily turns slowly and menacingly and looks over at Shira's table. She walks over to her)"
"SHIRA: (greets Emily warmly) Emily!"
"EMILY: Hello, Shira. (they kiss hello) I'm here to rescue you. I've got a table for you and Mitchum right in the center."
"SHIRA: Oh, bless you, Emily. I'm undeserving."
"EMILY: Nonsense. It was a terrible mistake, and it must be rectified."
"SHIRA: (referring to the band) Aren't they amazing?"
"EMILY: The whole combo is amazing. Follow me."
"SHIRA: Me, I love the b*at. Mitchum took me to see Paul McCartney last year, and I almost died. (Emily chuckles politely as Shira and her party get up. Emily holds Shira by the arm as she directs them to their new table)"
"EMILY: So Richard tells me we have a little problem."
"SHIRA: Really? With what?"
"EMILY: With the kids. Logan, Rory. I understand you're not exactly thrilled with the match, that you let that be known to Rory at the dinner she had at your house. (they reach the table)"
"SHIRA: Oh, well, I wouldn't say ""not thrilled""."
"EMILY: Then what would you say?"
"SHIRA: Oh, Emily, this is a party."
"EMILY: I'm just curious."
"SHIRA: This may not be the time and place, Emily. (she sits)"
"EMILY: (to two guests walking by) Hello, you two, drop by our table later. (back to Shira) Let's make it the time and place."
"SHIRA: Consider the discrepancies, Emily."
"EMILY: Well, that's what's confusing me. They both come from good families, both have good values. Money doesn't seem to be an issue. We all have money."
"SHIRA: Frankly, Emily, there's your money, then there's our money."
"EMILY: Oh?"
"SHIRA: And our family has a lot of responsibilities that come with that. An image to maintain."
"EMILY: Ah, yes! Well let me tell you this, Shira. We are just as good as you are. You don't think Rory is good enough for your son, as if we don't know Logan's reputation. We do. But he is welcome in our home anytime, and you should extend the same courtesy to Rory."
"SHIRA: Emily..."
"EMILY: Now let's talk about your money. (she bends over Shira?s chair) You were a two-bit gold digger, fresh off the bus from Hicksville when you met Mitchum at whatever bar you happened to stumble into. And what made Mitchum decide to choose you to marry amongst the pack of women he was bedding at the time, I'll never know. But hats off to you for bagging him. He's still a playboy, you know? Well, of course you know. That would explain why your weight goes up and down 30 pounds every other month. (Shira laughs uncomfortably) But that's your cross to bear. But these are ugly realities. No one needs to talk about them. Those kids are staying together for as long as they like. You won't stop them. Now, enjoy the event. (Emily walls away and Shira looks uncomfortable. Waving at another guest) Diane, hello! (Emily walks over to her table and sits down. The band Stops playing. The guests start to applaud as Rory walks on stage)"
"RORY: The Swing Dolls, everybody. (Richard walks back into the main Hall, as the people applaud) I'm Rory Gilmore, the architect of this event. (everyone starts to applaud again. Emily looks radiant) Thank you. And I'd like to take this moment to thank some others for the outstanding success this evening. To Lacey Boscombe, my right hand, my girl Friday, I could not have done it without you. To Glenda, Lance, the entire serving crew, thank you. To the kind people at KBC Audio who generously donated this amazing...(as Rory delivers her ""Thank You"" speech Richard looks at her with great sadness)"

"[Before the teaser there is a montage of scenes from previous episodes.]"
"MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO"
"[Lorelai enters and sits next to Sookie. The town meeting is about to start.]"
"LORELAI: Hi!"
"SOOKIE: Hey! Haven't started yet."
"LORELAI: Oh, good. Sorry I'm late. I found Paul Anka hiding underneath the kitchen sink, chewing on one of my favorite pairs of shoes."
"SOOKIE: Boy, that guy's career has really hit the skids. [She giggles and Lorelai rolls her eyes.] Okay, that is officially my last 'Paul Anka the person is living in your house' joke."
"[Lorelai nods. Taylor bangs the gavel to start the meeting.]"
"TAYLOR: Hello, everybody. Thank you all for coming. We have a packed agenda tonight so why don't we get started? First off, a little update on the improvements to the post office building -"
"[Kirk and Andrew burst in the side door and interrupt the meeting, they are dressed in re-enactors outfits.]"
"ANDREW: What be this?"
"KIRK: A gathering of some kind."
"ANDREW: Be it safe, or shall I raise my musket?"
"KIRK: Patience, brother! Despite the disturbing sight of women in pantaloons -"
"LORELAI: Oh, I hope this isn't an audience participation thing."
"TAYLOR: Excuse me, but we're in the middle of something here! Who are you?"
"GYPSY: It's Kirk!"
"KIRK: I am Phineas and this is my brother, Zebediah. We have come a long way. Through space and time."
"ANDREW: We hail from Stars Hollow. I, a silversmith and he, a simple cobbler."
"KIRK: With good rates. I will cobble you a... cobbled thing for a haypenny."
"SOOKIE: Does Kirk know what a cobbler is?"
"LORELAI: I'm guessing no."
"TAYLOR: But I know all the denizens of Stars Hollow. I don't recognize you!"
"GYPSY: It's Kirk and Andrew!"
"TAYLOR [Speaking strongly]: Gypsy."
"GYPSY: It is!"
"KIRK: And we do not recognize you. As residents of the year 1779, all looks foreign to us."
"LORELAI: Who's going to tell him those outfits are so 1778?"
"TAYLOR: Why, you have sojourned from the very year of Stars Hollow's founding! I pray, good sirs, do you still find our town pleasing?"
"KIRK: Yes, but much has changed. Samuel Munson's apothecary is gone, and with it, his leeches."
"ANDREW: And Old Clay's gambling hall, where we did frolic with wenches."
"KIRK: We are without leeches and wenches."
"ANDREW: And most disorienting, the street names. They're all so different!"
"KIRK: We were looking for Blacksmith's Road and found Peach Street."
"ANDREW: And for Longman's Leap and found Second Avenue."
"TAYLOR: That must be very confusing. Pray, tell me, how may we ease your passage?"
"KIRK: If the town were to return to it's old street names, we would more easily find our way."
"TAYLOR [theatrically]: The old street names, you say! Gentlemen, do take seats while I confer with my contemporaries."
"[They sit next too Gypsy, in the front row with.]"
"GYPSY: Who are you fooling?"
"KIRK: Shh!"
"GYPSY: You're wearing tube socks."
"TAYLOR: Ladies and gentlemen, our tourism revenue is off twenty-six percent from the previous fiscal year. In that same time, Woodbury and Cogsville's revenue has jumped. That's because they are highlighting their heritage, thus increasing their charm. The more charm a town has, the greater its tourism revenue."
"MISS PATTY: We've got charm."
"BABETTE: Yeah! You wouldn't believe the bikini waxes Lisa's doing at the beauty parlor! Any shape you can imagine. So clever. And charming."
"TAYLOR: But not historically charming. Which is why I'm proposing changing our street names back to what they were at Stars Hollow's founding."
"MISS PATTY: Isn't that going to cost a lot of money?"
"BABETTE: Yeah, Taylor, you hate spending money."
"TAYLOR: This is an investment in our future."
"GYPSY: I'll have to buy new business cards."
"LORELAI: I think it would be kinda cool."
"MISS PATTY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I like old-timey stuff, and the Dragonfly's on Third Street, which is kind of boring."
"TAYLOR: Well, thank you, Lorelai, for your sound opinion. I think it's one of my better ideas."
"LORELAI: I agree. It's not like the time you guaranteed the tourists a mosquito-free summer and then released hundreds of bats all over town."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, that was a stinker."
"SOOKIE: Or how about when he was trying to attract families to visit the town by driving his van around other towns and beckoning kids with candy!"
"[Giggling and laughing from the crowd.]"
"GYPSY: That was dumb."
"BABETTE: Really dumb!"
"TAYLOR: So... we're saying this is a good idea?"
"LORELAI: That is what we're saying."
"TAYLOR: Let's put it to a vote, then, shall we? All those in favour raise hands."
"[Most of the people raise their hands.]"
"TAYLOR: Excellent, then the motion is passed and we shall change our street names! [He bangs the gavel.] Now, our next order of business -"
"BABETTE: Oh, wait! What about when he had us re-enact the Boston Tea Party in the lake!"
"TAYLOR [warning]: Babette."
"GYPSY: What a disaster."
"MISS PATTY: We're still paying off the EPA fines!"
"TAYLOR: Folks, please."
"LORELAI: What about the museum of rocks that looked like famous people?"
"SOOKIE: Ooh, that's my favorite!"
"[Jackson rolls his eyes and everyone laughs.]"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai is reading the newspaper at the counter, when Lane brings her breakfast.]"
"LANE: Here you go, scooped bagel, cream cheese, jam."
"LORELAI: Thank you! Did you save the scoopings? [Lane brings up an extra plate.] I love you."
"LANE: So, what's going on in the world?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"LANE: Nothing."
"LORELAI: - good. There's nothing good. There's absolutely nothing even remotely positive going on anywhere in the world. How can that be?"
"LANE: That's why I don't read the paper anymore."
"LORELAI: You will mine. I'm starting my own. The Good News Daily. Nothing but good news, every day."
"LANE: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: ""No civil w*r in Canada."" Big article. ""Cars drive down road without incident."" Front-page news. ""Puppies, how cute are they?"" In-depth expose and the subscription is free. How happy is that?"
"LANE: I may end up in a better mood."
"LUKE [Going behind the counter]: So what are you hanging out here for?"
"LORELAI: Oh, ouch, what happened to the love?"
"LUKE: You know what I mean. You're usually at the inn by now."
"LORELAI: Well, new street names are being posted today. I'm waiting for Sookie and Michel, we're going to go see what name the Dragonfly got. Want to come with, see what name you got?"
"LUKE: I'll wait to read about it in the Good News Daily."
"LORELAI: All right. It's another dumb Taylor thing, sorry. You may now lower your blood pressure."
"LUKE: That's not why I'm not going, I just don't have the time. I think changing the street names' a fine idea."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"LUKE: No, change 'em all. Name 'em after cartoon characters. I'll be on Scooby Doo Lane. It's all the same to me."
"LORELAI: Where's this coming from?"
"LUKE: It's taken me a ridiculous amount of years, but when it comes to all things Taylor I've adopted a Zen attitude."
"LORELAI [surprised]: Zen."
"LUKE: Go with the flow, let the River Taylor take you where it may. Don't fight it, just let it happen."
"LORELAI: But what if he wants to paint the diner pink for Easter like he did last year."
"LUKE: Then let the building be pink."
"LORELAI: But what if he decides we should all dress up as our favorite tree again for Arbor Day?"
"LUKE: Wrap me in bark, fill me with sap, tell me where to stand."
"LORELAI: Well, what if he wants to Photoshop a picture of you with your arm around him and slap it on a billboard that overlooks the whole town?"
"LUKE: The river's end -"
"LORELAI: You're sitting on his lap."
"LUKE: - will keep on flowing."
"LORELAI: Holding a baby rattle."
"LUKE: Let me keep my Zen."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna miss Nuclear Luke."
"[Michel and Sookie enter.]"
"SOOKIE [lively]: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hi!"
"SOOKIE: We just passed Esther Wilkins. She got Constabulary Road. Constabulary Road! How cool is that?"
"LORELAI: Very! I'll be done here in a minute."
"MICHEL: Do you have coffee?"
"LUKE: You mean, here, at my coffee shop? Uh, let me think. Yeah."
"MICHEL: Give it."
"LORELAI: You're going to need a little Zen for him too."
"MICHEL: This is very early for me to get up."
"SOOKIE: You'll survive, big guy!"
"MICHEL: I'm not at my best if I don't get my model's twelve."
"SOOKIE: Well, you hide beautifully."
"MICHEL: It's the keels. Absinthe serum with ginkgo extract. Like you're washing your face in a bowl of diamonds."
"SOOKIE: A bowl of diamonds? Doesn't that just cut up your face?"
"MICHEL: Huh. I need my coffee."
"[Lorelai looks in the paper again and is taken aback seeing a photo of Rory from the DAR part from last week.]"
"ELDER GILMORE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM"
"[Richard is also reading the same newspaper and looking at the same photo.]"
"EMILY: Does your grapefruit taste strange to you?"
"RICHARD: What?"
"EMILY: The grapefruit. Is it unnaturally sweet?"
"RICHARD: It tastes like grapefruit, Emily."
"EMILY: There's sugar on it. I can taste it. Consuela put sugar on it."
"RICHARD: If you say."
"EMILY: That girl puts sugar on everything! Like yesterday's salmon. Fish is not supposed to be caramelised."
"RICHARD: I didn't notice."
"EMILY: Don't defend her, Richard."
"RICHARD: I'm not defending her, Emily."
"EMILY [stands up]: It starts with the grapefruit, next it'll be the berries, the melons. Pretty soon everything in this house will be candied."
"[Walking to the intercom.] Rory, breakfast is ready!"
"[Rory, stunted sits up in bed, still half asleep she walks over to the intercom.]"
"EMILY: Rory, are you there? Rory!"
"RORY [mumbling into the intercom]: Good morning, Grandma."
"EMILY: You're not still sleeping, are you?"
"RORY [yawns]: No."
"EMILY: You're missing Katie Couric."
"RORY: I don't watch Katie Couric."
"EMILY: Oh. I thought you watch Katie Couric. I heard you mention her once."
"RORY: Grandma, did you find someone to fix the intercom yet? It's stuck at this one volume. Loud."
"EMILY: I've been looking and looking, but the company that made it went out of business in 1973. The Binsor Corp. Arthur Godfried was their spokesman."
"RORY: Who?"
"EMILY: Oh, he was sort of a Katie Couric of his day. We'll get the intercom fixed, I promise."
"RORY: Good."
"EMILY: So I'll go ahead and pour you some coffee?"
"RORY: I'll be right in."
"EMILY: I'm signing off! Ten-four!"
"RORY [sleepily]: Ten-four."
"[Emily goes back to her seat, as she passes Richard she see the photo in the paper.]"
"EMILY: Isn't that a pretty picture?"
"RICHARD: The prettiest."
"EMILY: That outfit matched her face. You'll get extra copies for us, right?"
"RICHARD: I'll have my secretary get them."
"EMILY [sitting]: So have you seen Logan around lately?"
"RICHARD: I don't know if it was lately."
"EMILY: That makes me nervous."
"RICHARD: Well, he's busy too."
"EMILY: I hope that's it, and not something else."
"RICHARD: What else would it be?"
"EMILY: Oh, that talk I had with Shira. I hoped our understanding was clear about those two. That we were going to let them be. Maybe I was just being naive. [Richard turns the page.] Richard, are you listening to me?"
"RICHARD: Yes, Emily. And just because you haven't seen the boy doesn't mean anything. Our hours are different from theirs."
"[The doorbell rings and Emily looks around.]"
"EMILY: Consuela! Consuela! [She throws her napkin down and gets up.] She's probably in the backyard harvesting sugar cane. [She walks to the front door.]"
"RICHARD [under his breath]: Maybe Consuela and Logan have run off together."
"EMILY [OS]: Not funny! [She receives a package for Mr. Gilmore.] Thanks."
"RICHARD: Logan's probably out of town. Or busy with school."
"EMILY [OS]: All I know is I haven't seen him and Rory is lying in bed 'till eight-thirty every morning. [She walks back in.] That could be some sort of young woman's melancholy. Something from your office. [Giving an envelope to Richard.] Though why I had to fetch it I don't know. I'll remind Consuela it's part of her job. Assuming she hasn't left us to go work full-time for that giant sugar consortium that sent her here. What's that?"
"RICHARD: Just an insurance claim from the Dragonfly."
"EMILY: A claim? What sort of claim?"
"RICHARD: Oh, they had a small fire there last week."
"EMILY: They had a fire?"
"RICHARD: Oh, don't get excited."
"EMILY: Is Lorelai okay?"
"RICHARD: She's fine."
"EMILY: Did you talk to her?"
"RICHARD: I talked to her."
"EMILY: You talked to her."
"RICHARD: Yes, Emily. She had a small fire."
"EMILY: Well, how did she sound?"
"RICHARD: Just like she'd had a small fire. It was a very quick face-to-face, and then I left."
"EMILY: Face-to-face? You saw her face-to-face?"
"RICHARD: Well, I had to go over there."
"EMILY: Why did you have to go over there?"
"RICHARD: Because, Emily! She'd just had a small fire!"
"EMILY: How did she look?"
"RICHARD: Fine."
"EMILY: Was she thin, heavy, did she look tired? What was she wearing? And is she still in that netherworld of 'I don't know what my hair is supposed to be'?"
"RICHARD: She looked just like Lorelai."
"[Giving up she goes back to her seat.]"
"RICHARD: It was a very brief conversation! Unlike the one you and I are having."
"EMILY: You should have told me, Richard. [She takes a bite of her grapefruit and grimaces.] And this grapefruit is definitely sugared!"
"STARS HOLLOW STREET"
"[Lorelai, Sookie and Michel are walking.]"
"LORELAI: I hope it's something like Calla Lily Lane. You know, like a flower, something pretty."
"SOOKIE: Or Charing Cross Road, or Abbey Road, something classic."
"MICHEL: Can we walk a little faster, please?"
"SOOKIE: Michel's still pouting?"
"MICHEL: I'm not pouting."
"LORELAI: Oh, so your botox has worn off?"
"MICHEL: It has not, and I'm not pouting."
"LORELAI: Well, then, get with the spirit. This is a workout, and you're getting paid for this."
"MICHEL: So it takes the three of us to stare at a stupid piece of cardboard. Maybe later we can all gang up on that light bulb."
"[They stop at the town map of Stars Hollow.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, let's see here."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, I'm so excited. It's like Spanish class where everyone gets a Spanish name."
"LORELAI: What were you?"
"SOOKIE: Sookia. I don't think it's a real Spanish name, I think they just added an 'A' on the end."
"[They look at the map.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, see, where are we?"
"SOOKIE: There! Right there!"
"MICHEL: That is the lake, Sookie. If we were there, we would all have drowned. We are at the bottom."
"LORELAI: No, no, no, I think we're off to the right. Or, off to the left. Wait, where's north?"
"SOOKIE: Everything's rotated ninety degrees. This map's completely whack-a-doodle. I can't find - oh."
"MICHEL: Oh, no."
"LORELAI [gasps]: Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no."
"DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Sookie and Michel enter, in a bad mood, followed by Lorelai on her cell phone.]"
"LORELAI: Yeah. No, I understand, Taylor's a very busy man, but it's just a quick question. Lorelai Gilmore. You know me, Joey. You cleaned out my rain gutters last year. Yes, I paid you! I most definitely paid you!"
"SOOKIE: Got to be a mistake. Got to be a mistake!"
"MICHEL: Sores and Boils Alley."
"SOOKIE: Stop saying that!"
"MICHEL: We are on Sores and Boils Alley!"
"SOOKIE: What kind of menu could you serve on Sores and Boils Alley, huh? Huh?"
"MICHEL: Anything in a crust."
"SOOKIE: Eugh."
"LORELAI: Try in the storage room, Joey! Yes, I know it's creepy in there, but I really need to speak to him."
"SOOKIE: Why couldn't it be something that didn't ooze or run? Like a wart! Or a bunion! Bunions are okay. They're sort of onions mixed with buns, and that's sort of appetizing if you don't think too hard."
"MICHEL: You know what this means, don't you?"
"LORELAI: It means nothing."
"SOOKIE: It means my next review will be in the New England Journal of Medicine!"
"LORELAI: I want you to both chill out. I will fix this just as soon as I get Taylor on the phone."
"SOOKIE: Okay. Maybe if we come up with a catchy phrase. You know, something funny, so it seems like we're in on the joke, you know? Like, we're aware. Ironic and hip."
"[A deliveryman comes in the room and goes to Lorelai.]"
"MICHEL: Like what? What catchy phrase using the words Sores and Boils will make us seem like we're in on the joke?"
"DELIVERYMAN: Delivery."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I'll sign for it."
"[She signs for a package, the deliveryman leaves.]"
"SOOKIE: Michel, don't get hostile with me!"
"MICHEL: You are a silly woman."
"SOOKIE: I am not silly! You're silly!"
"LORELAI [opening up the box]: Hey, I want you both to cut it out. Now, I am going to fix this. I mean, the whole idea behind this street name thing was to improve tourism. You know? Not destroy it. So - huh. [She pulls out an old cuckoo clock.] Sookie, did you order this?"
"SOOKIE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Michel?"
"MICHEL: Yeah, right. Like I'm going to buy an analog clock. Do I look two hundred and five?"
"LORELAI: Well, apparently it's for me, but I didn't order a clock. [On the phone.] Uh, yes, I'm still here. No, okay, just tell him I called. [She hangs up the phone.]"
"SOOKIE: You couldn't find Taylor?"
"LORELAI: Don't worry, I will!"
"MICHEL: I'm going to go add a few select fibs to my resume."
"LORELAI: Michel! [He leaves.] I will find him, Sookie, don't cry!"
"SOOKIE [almost crying]: White sauce looks like pus!"
"LORELAI: Go in the kitchen, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Salsa Verde looks like infection!"
"LORELAI: Kitchen, go!"
"[On her way to the kitchen, Sookie whimpers. Lorelai checks out the new clock.]"
"RORY'S POOL HOUSE"
"[Logan knocks on the door of the pool house, Rory waves him in. He is carrying a very big shopping bag.]"
"RORY: Wow, you made good time."
"LOGAN: Silly rabbit, speed limits are for kids. [They kiss.]"
"RORY: Hey, you went shopping?"
"LOGAN: Actually, I did."
"RORY: For me?"
"LOGAN: For you."
"RORY: Wow, what's the occasion?"
"LOGAN: Where is it written you need an occasion?"
"RORY [pulls a large box out of the bag]: Wow, you did it. You brought me the head of Alfredo Garcia."
"LOGAN [laughing]: Open it, Ace."
"[She takes a large cloth bag out of the box.]"
"RORY: Wow, cool, a bag!"
"LOGAN: Look inside!"
"[She pulls a pink leather purse out of the cloth bag.]"
"RORY: Wow, cool! A bag!"
"LOGAN: You like it?"
"RORY: Hello, I'm a girl. It's a purse."
"LOGAN: Not just a purse, it's a Birkin bag."
"RORY: I went to school with a guy named Birkin."
"LOGAN: I don't think this is the same Birkin."
"RORY: Oh. Well, it's beautiful. I mean, it's snazzy and classy, and oh, smell it. It's got that great new car smell, except it's not a car. Oh, I love it Logan. I love it. Thank you so much. [She looks in the pockets.]"
"LOGAN: You're welcome. Sorry, there's not another bag inside the bag inside the bag inside the box inside the bag."
"RORY: It's great. You know, I think my computer cords would fit in this perfectly."
"LOGAN: Uh, this is not a computer cord kind of purse, Ace. You know what, why don't you just call my sister, she'll fill you in. It's like a 'thing', you know?"
"RORY [smiling]: Huh. It's a thing. A beautiful leather grown-up thing."
"LOGAN: So you ready to go?"
"RORY: Uh, yeah. [She picks up her old purse, starts moving the contents it into the new bag, she gives up and puts the whole thing inside.] Let's go!"
"[They leave together.]"
"LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Paul Anka is on the bed and Lorelai sits next to him, she is waiting on the phone.]"
"LORELAI: Come on, Taylor, answer!"
"TAYLOR: Taylor's Ye Olde Soda Shoppe! How can I help ye?"
"LORELAI: Taylor! It's Lorelai! I've been trying to reach you all day."
"TAYLOR: Lorelai! Oh, well, Joey mentioned that. He also mentioned something about not being paid for some rain gutters he cleaned? That's not cool."
"LORELAI: Look, Taylor, um, do you by any chance know what street name the Dragonfly got?"
"TAYLOR: Of course! Sores and Boils Alley!"
"LORELAI: So you knew about it."
"TAYLOR: Absolutely."
"LORELAI: Sores and Boils?"
"TAYLOR: That's right."
"LORELAI: Sores and Boils?"
"TAYLOR: Yes, indeed. I'd k*ll to have that name, quite frankly. You're a lucky woman."
"LORELAI: How?"
"TAYLOR: Sores and Boils Alley is one of the most historical places in all Stars Hollow! In the eighteenth century, if you had a sore or a boil, you came to Stars Hollow to have it lanced -"
"LORELAI: Yeah, but -"
"TAYLOR: - to the very site of your establishment! Word is they also had a leper colony in your garage! I'm trying to verify that. If we do, you get a plaque."
"LORELAI: Okay, Taylor. Look. [The doorbell rings goes and answers it.]"
"TAYLOR: Truth is, this town wouldn't be here without your street! Sores and boils may seem minor to us now, as we sit here with our Sea Breeze astringent and our Pond's cold cream, but time was they were the scourge with no cure. And where was that noble work done? Where were the sick cured and the suffering put at ease? I'll tell you where, on Sores and Boils Alley! In fact, I even have a valuable collection of antique lances. Yours for the asking. As a loaner, of course. The Dragonfly can display them in the lobby. Assuming you're bonded. [Lorelai opens the door to another deliveryman. He brings in a huge box and sets it down, she signs for it and he leaves.]"
"LORELAI: Look, the historical thing, it's swell. The boils and sores and lepers and lances. Great stuff. If you're running a hospice in the eighteenth century. But I'm running an inn in the twenty-first!"
"TAYLOR: And?"
"LORELAI: People come here for a beautiful nice romantic time. And part of what I slightly overcharge them for is the ambiance."
"TAYLOR: Is there a point here?"
"LORELAI: The point is that I don't want to have to go around advertising, 'Come to historic Stars Hollow! It's not as gross as it sounds!'"
"TAYLOR: I must say, I'm very surprised at this negativity! You were so supportive at the meeting. What happened, a fight with Luke?"
"LORELAI: Look, Taylor, I'm trying to be very Zen about this, but this name is just not going to work for me!"
"TAYLOR: Well, I'm not really sure what to do about this."
"LORELAI: We could just keep our old street name. No harm, no foul, no Lorelai pulling her hair out."
"TAYLOR: No. The whole town's changing, that won't work at all. But I will think about your situation and try to come up with alternatives."
"LORELAI: Great. And I'll think about it too, and together I'm sure we'll figure something out. Huh? We can fix this!"
"TAYLOR: All right."
"LORELAI: Great. Thank you, Taylor."
"[She hangs up the phone, pulling a very big antique birdcage out of the box. She looks at Paul Anka.]"
"LORELAI: You order a birdcage?"
"GILMORE HOUSE - OUTSIDE"
"[Walking past the main house.]"
"RORY: I've never had so many compliments about anything."
"LOGAN: It's not the bag, Ace, it's the arm it's on."
"RORY: And, I, like, swear that I'm not going to let ballpoint pens explode in the bottom of it."
"LOGAN: Crap, I left my cell back in the car."
"RORY: Are you expecting a call?"
"LOGAN: From my dad. He's dragging me to a corporate retreat at his editor's. Three days of absolutely, Mitchum. Great idea, Mitchum. Can I pre-chew that food for you, Mitchum?"
"RORY: You can suffer through three days."
"LOGAN: I'll meet you back at the pool house, okay?"
"RORY: Don't get lost."
"[Logan watches Rory walking towards the pool house as Richard opens the side door of the main house.]"
"RICHARD: Oh, Logan! I thought I heard a noise."
"LOGAN: Richard. Yes, I was just dropping Rory off."
"RICHARD: Oh! [He checks his watch.] Ten o'clock on the button, well done!"
"LOGAN: Well, I didn't want to keep her out too late, sir."
"RICHARD: Well, you're a responsible young man, Logan. Say, how about a nightcap? I have a new single malt I'm dying to break in."
"LOGAN [shrugging]: Sounds great."
"[Richard closes the door behind him.]"
"RICHARD [to Emily]: Look who I found!"
"EMILY: Logan! You found Logan. How are you?"
"LOGAN: How are you, Emily?"
"RICHARD: Logan was just dropping Rory off."
"EMILY: Ten o'clock on the button!"
"RICHARD: A gentleman, this one."
"EMILY: Logan, would you like some coffee? Perhaps some dessert?"
"LOGAN: Thanks, Emily, but I've eaten."
"RICHARD: I thought the two of us would, uh, grab a little nightcap."
"EMILY: Well, I'll leave you men to your drinks."
"LOGAN: Good seeing you, Emily."
"[Emily leaves.]"
"RICHARD [offering Logan a seat]: Please."
"[He sits and Richard starts making the drinks.]"
"RICHARD: So, how are things, Logan?"
"LOGAN: Fine."
"RICHARD: Good. Back at school, are you?"
"LOGAN: For a few weeks now."
"RICHARD: Good, good. Good that you're back. Got any classes that you're interested in this year?"
"LOGAN: Semester's shaping up okay. [Richard hands Logan his drink.] Thank you."
"RICHARD: Oh. Cheers. [Richard sits down as they each take a sip.] You working at the Yale paper again?"
"LOGAN: Yes, sir."
"RICHARD: Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?"
"LOGAN: Not if the tree has anything to say about it."
"RICHARD: Yes, well. It's good to see you. We don't get many sightings of you young people nowadays, the two of you, ensconced back there at the pool house. Rory's so busy. Her life's a total mystery to us. She could be in the CIA for all we know."
"LOGAN: Well, I don't think she's joined the CIA, sir, but I'll check her purse for secret documents."
"RICHARD [chuckles]: So, tell me, Logan, what is going on with Rory? Uh, yours and Rory's life?"
"LOGAN: Uh, nothing special."
"RICHARD: No? Oh, well. Does she have any big plans?"
"LOGAN: Plans?"
"RICHARD: Yes, well, the way that girl keeps to herself, we wouldn't know if she was moving to Peru. Are you two planning on moving to Peru?"
"LOGAN: No, we're not."
"RICHARD: Well, if not Peru, then what is on the horizon for Rory? And for you. Anything different going to happen?"
"LOGAN: I don't, uh, well, we're thinking of going to the Vineyard in a few weeks, that's about it."
"RICHARD: A trip to the Vineyard?"
"LOGAN: Yes, sir."
"RICHARD: Nothing else coming down the pike?"
"LOGAN: No, sir."
"[Logan sees Rory through the window behind Richard.]"
"RICHARD: Hm. Well, the Vineyard is always nice. Very brisk this time of year."
"RORY [entering]: Hey, Logan. What are you doing here? I thought you'd left."
"LOGAN: I ran into Richard on the way out."
"EMILY [coming back down the stairs]: Rory, is that you?"
"RORY: Um, yeah, Grandma, it's me."
"EMILY: What are you doing here?"
"RORY: Well, I was just looking for some sugar. For my morning coffee."
"EMILY: Oh, please, don't get me started on sugar."
"LOGAN: Richard and I were just catching up."
"RICHARD: Having a little ‘digestif'."
"LOGAN: Yes, and, Richard, the scotch was great, but I should probably get going given the hour."
"RICHARD: Oh, of course."
"RORY: I'll walk you out."
"LOGAN: Richard, Emily."
"RICHARD: Good to see you, Logan."
"EMILY: Drive safe!"
"[Rory and Logan both leave.]"
"EMILY [smiles up at Richard]: So what were you two chatting about?"
"RICHARD: Oh, this and that."
"EMILY: Did it seem like everything was fine between the two of them?"
"RICHARD: Far as I could tell. We're missing Charlie Rose."
"[They head upstairs. Rory and Logan tiptoe past the window.]"
"RORY'S POOLHOUSE"
"[Rory and Logan enter.]"
"RORY: What was that all about?"
"LOGAN: What was that about? Your grandfather was asking me about my intentions."
"RORY: Your intentions? Toward what?"
"LOGAN: Uh, toward you. Us. Marriage."
"RORY: What? Why?"
"LOGAN: I don't know. Suddenly I was in there and he was asking me all kinds of questions about our plans and the future and the CIA and Peru."
"RORY: I don't understand! Why would he do this?"
"LOGAN: I don't know."
"RORY: I'm only twenty. We're young. We just started going out. Why would we even be thinking about marriage?"
"LOGAN: I don't know, Ace. These are all really good questions. Listen, maybe we should hang out at my place for a while so as not to give your grandparents a visual to latch onto."
"RORY: No. Look, I'll take care of this. I promise. Don't worry about it."
"LOGAN: Ace, it's okay. You don't have to do anything."
"RORY: No, this is not okay. This is not cool. I don't want them thinking this, I don't want you feeling like you can't come over here. I promise you, I will take care of this, okay?"
"LOGAN: Okay. Oh!"
"RORY: What?"
"LOGAN: My cell phone's still in my car."
"RORY: Oh, sorry."
"LOGAN: Hey, if I'm not back in five minutes it means I'm in the main house picking out china patterns with Emily."
"[Logan leaves.]"
"DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Michel at the front desk. Lorelai walks up to him]"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm starved."
"MICHEL: You're always starved."
"LORELAI: Yes, but now I'm crash landed in the Andes, eat my team mates starved. I'll be back in an hour. [She sees a small pile of packages on the counter.] No."
"MICHEL: Mm-hm. Three more packages, all for you."
"LORELAI [opening the boxes]: Where is all this stupid stuff coming from?"
"[She pulls out a china figurine.]"
"MICHEL: Looks like classic home shopping channel merchandise to me."
"LORELAI: I haven't bought anything off the home shopping channel."
"MICHEL: That you remember."
"LORELAI: How could I not remember?"
"MICHEL: You could be deluding yourself. Suppressing a shameful, costly, and yes, extremely tacky shopping addiction from your memory."
"LORELAI: I do not have a home shopping channel addiction. [She removes a matching figurine from the second box.] This does look familiar. Like I've seen it before."
"MICHEL: Mm-hm. And was Joan Rivers or Suzanne Somers holding it up?"
"LORELAI: I'm not buying these things."
"MICHEL: Keep telling yourself that. By the way, Kirk is in the dining room wanting to speak to you."
"LORELAI: Must be about the street name."
"MICHEL: Can you contain your personal demons long enough to face him, or shall I send him away?"
"LORELAI: Enough, Michel."
"MICHEL: It's never enough. That is the problem."
""
""
""
"[Lorelai walks into the dining room, shakes hands with Kirk.]"
"KIRK: Lorelai, hello."
"LORELAI: Hello, Kirk."
"KIRK: Have a seat."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[They sit down.]"
"KIRK: I'm pleased to inform you that the Stars Hollow board of tourism has graciously decided to offer you a proposal."
"LORELAI [relieved]: Great. I appreciate it. What do you have for me?"
"KIRK: Well, you can choose any of three historically anchored street names that pre-dated Sores and Boils Alley. It's a generous proposal."
"LORELAI: Let's hear 'em."
"KIRK: The first one is Constabulary Road."
"LORELAI: Constabulary Road."
"KIRK: It's a very nice name. Classic. Very evocative of old-time Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: Yes, it's very nice, but Kirk, that's the exact same name of Esther Wilkins' street. I mean, the exact name. It's taken."
"KIRK: I know. Apparently at one time there were several streets named Constabulary Road in Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that would be incredibly confusing."
"KIRK: Oh, it would be a disaster. It was back then, too. Mail was mis-delivered, soldiers lost their way. It completely disoriented senior citizens. There was rioting, chaos, death. Everyone hated it."
"LORELAI: What's number two?"
"KIRK: Number two. Chergogagog Manchogagog Cherbonagongamog."
"LORELAI: Chergona-what?"
"KIRK: An old Nimblook Indian name. It means: you fish on your side of the lake, I'll fish on my side, no one fishes in the middle. Or maybe it means Buffalo."
"LORELAI: It's unpronouncable. Next?"
"KIRK: From 1768, something flavorful. Crusty Bulge."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on!"
"KIRK: Is that a no?"
"LORELAI: Yes, that's a no! Kirk, these are not legitimate choices!"
"KIRK: Taylor thinks they are."
"LORELAI: Well, Taylor is wrong. The Dragonfly is a business! We need a credible street name! So I'll tell you what we're going to do, we're keeping Third Street."
"KIRK: Taylor is not going to like that."
"LORELAI: Well, too bad. 'Cause that's what we're doing. Decision made. 'Cause it's not going to be Crusty Bulge! And it's not going to be an Indian name that no one can pronounce, and it's not going to be a name that fifty thousand other people had that caused mass chaos and death in 1492 and oh my God, I just realized where all that stuff is from!"
"KIRK: What? What stuff?"
"LORELAI [stands]: Never mind, just tell Taylor what I said."
"KIRK: So we're done here?"
"LORELAI: Definitely."
"KIRK [loosening off his tie]: Thank God. Mom tied this way too tight."
"[Lorelai leaves.]"
"RORY'S POOL HOUSE"
"[Rory's pours herself some coffee. Hearing a knock at the door, she answers it. Emily enter with a very old man.]"
"EMILY: Am I disturbing?"
"RORY: No, come on in."
"EMILY: Rory, this is Edgar Pullings. He installed the intercom forty-six years ago."
"RORY: Nice to meet you."
"[Pause.]"
"EMILY [shouting]: She said 'nice to meet you'!"
"EDGAR: Oh. Nice to meet you, young lady."
"EMILY: He calls me that, too. [Loudly] It's right in there, Edgar!"
"EDGAR: Okay, I'll have a look-see."
"EMILY [loudly]: You just holler when you're situated and I'll bring in your toolbox. And if you're feeling faint or need a glass of water, don't be shy!"
"[Emily leads the old man to the bedroom and turns back to Rory.] I'm sorry for the short notice, but once I found him I thought I'd better get him over here before he - retires."
"RORY: No, it's great. Thank you."
"EMILY: Everything else around here up to snuff? Are the sheets being over-ironed?"
"RORY: No. They're perfect."
"EMILY: Because that's not an urban legend. If sheets have a high thread count, they can be over-ironed."
"RORY [Nods]: Grandma, can I ask a favour?"
"EMILY: Of course."
"RORY: I was just wondering if you would speak with Grandpa for me."
"EMILY: About what?"
"[They both sit on the lounge.]"
"RORY: Well, when he had the nightcap with Logan, he said some things that made Logan a little uncomfortable."
"EMILY: Oh, no, what kind of things?"
"RORY: Just things about our future – Logan's and mine. I think Grandpa wanted to find out if we were getting married."
"EMILY [surprised]: What?"
"RORY: And the thing is, we're young. And we haven't been going out for that long. It's way too soon for us to be thinking about getting serious."
"EMILY: Of course it is! Your grandfather should know better. Don't you worry, I'll clear this up with him."
"RORY: Thank you, Grandma."
"EMILY: My pleasure. So, now that that's taken care of, tell me. Just between us girls. How are things going between you two?"
"RORY [blushing]: Well, they're great. Logan's very nice. He bought me this terrific gift, just completely out of the blue."
"EMILY: Is that so?"
"RORY: Totally unexpected. It's called a Birkin bag?"
"EMILY [floored]: A Birkin bag. Oh, my God. A Birkin bag?"
"RORY: You've heard of it?"
"EMILY: Of course! That's a very nice purse!"
"RORY: Oh. Maybe I shouldn't use it?"
"EMILY: Oh, no. A Birkin bag is meant to be used. And seen."
"RORY: I had no idea."
"EMILY [pleased]: Well, well, well. A Birkin bag! A Birkin bag. A Birkin bag for Rory."
"RORY: Grandma."
"EMILY: I'm just saying, I mean, Richard never bought me a Birkin bag. Oh, this is exciting!"
"RORY: I guess it is!"
"EMILY: A Birkin bag! I'm going to remember this day. [Day dreaming.]"
"RORY: Um, it's been very quiet in there."
"EMILY: Huh? Oh, dear! [She gets up and hurries to the bedroom.] Edgar! Edgar! Edgar!"
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai enters.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, my God, I made it! Food. Me. Give."
"LUKE: Emergency B.L.T."
"LORELAI: Yeah! Emergency chilli fries and black and white shake. It's a three-alarm emergency."
"LUKE: Something came for you early this morning, good old Caesar signed for it."
"[He gestures to a giant urn next to the window to the Taylor's ""Soda Shoppee"".]"
"LORELAI [gasps]: Oh my God!"
"LUKE: Now, normally I have a blanket policy against the diner accepting humungous five-foot urns addressed to other people, but I was at the market and Caesar, he apparently didn't know about the policy."
"LORELAI: Oh, she is good. Covering all the bases."
"LUKE: Who?"
"LORELAI: And sending it here. Brilliant! Picking away at the people closest to me."
"LUKE: Who? Who is this?"
"LORELAI: Emily Gilmore!"
"LUKE: You're kidding!"
"LORELAI: For days she's been emptying her house, sending me everything she doesn't need anymore, trying to smoke me out of my foxhole."
"LUKE: Well, call her and tell her to knock it off!"
"LORELAI: Oh, no! That's exactly what she wants! I poke my head out of the foxhole, it gets blown off! Then I have no head, Luke!"
"LUKE: There's a giant urn in my diner."
"LORELAI: It started small, you know? A clock, a birdcage, some Victorian figurines, an old telescope. That was just the ground w*r. She was softening me up. Now comes the aerial campaign. The carpet b*mb. And I bet she'll b*mb me with actual carpets!"
"LUKE: Call her."
"LORELAI: You mean surrender? Never!"
"LUKE: If you don't call her, she's just going to keep sending you stuff. Sending me stuff."
"LORELAI: She'll run out of stuff."
"LUKE: She'll buy more stuff."
"LORELAI: She'll run out of money."
"LUKE: She's got endless money."
"LORELAI: Luke, my mom has a tenth-degree black belt in passive aggression. There is no counter to this move! Which means I am not going to counter."
"LUKE: But I can't have a giant urn sitting in my restaurant."
"LORELAI: Actually it's more of a vase."
"LUKE: I don't care what it is! The thing weighs three hundred pounds. Caesar said it took four guys to bring it in."
"LORELAI: You've got to admit, it does kind of spruce up the place."
"LUKE: It goes today."
"LORELAI: Okay, okay. I'll work on figuring out how to get it out of here."
"[She sighs.] You know, I think it's actually one of a matching pair."
"RICHARD'S STUDY"
"[Emily knocking on the open door.]"
"EMILY: You busy?"
"RICHARD: Not too."
"EMILY: I wanted to let you know Rory had a little talk with me today I thought I'd share with you."
"RICHARD: Eh? What about?"
"EMILY: About Logan. About something you said. It's been handled."
"RICHARD: Something I said? When?"
"EMILY: Don't worry. He's fine, she's fine, they're fine. Very fine. Logan bought her the most beautiful and prestigious handbag in the world."
"RICHARD: A handbag?"
"EMILY: A Birkin bag! I've shown you pictures before, remember? Around my birthday. So sophisticated. Now we know our worries about Shira messing with things were unfounded. They are doing very well."
"RICHARD: Yes, yes, that's fine, Emily, but what did I say that caused a problem?"
"EMILY: Well, you scared the poor boy half to death during that nightcap of yours."
"RICHARD: How?"
"EMILY: Your intentions speech? It was so out of the blue!"
"RICHARD: My intentions speech? I'm not following. Intentions about what?"
"EMILY: Really, Richard, you're always a half-step behind."
"RICHARD: That's because you tell me things in drips and drabs. What does she think I said?"
"EMILY: That you basically asked when he was going to propose to her."
"RICHARD: I asked him nothing of the sort! We were just chatting. sh**ting the breeze!"
"EMILY: Well, Logan viewed it as an interrogation about his and Rory's future."
"RICHARD: The boy misunderstood! I wasn't talking about their future. I was talking – it was scotch talk. I would never dream of interrogating a man like that. I'll apologize to him the next time I see him! And to Rory."
"EMILY: Good."
"RICHARD: I mean, that's ridiculous. Those two are way too young to be thinking about marriage. They just met each other."
"EMILY: It's been over a year."
"RICHARD: It hasn't been a year! They're babies!"
"EMILY: Babies! Richard, your granddaughter is about to turn twenty-one! If they did get engaged, the ceremony would be next year at the earliest, or the year after. That makes her twenty-three."
"RICHARD: And too young!"
"EMILY: It's the same age I was when we got married. I wasn't too young."
"RICHARD: Well, we were different."
"EMILY: How?"
"RICHARD: Because we're us, and Rory's Rory. She has things to do."
"EMILY: I don't know why you're so worked up about this. They aren't engaged."
"RICHARD: Good."
"EMILY: What was your talk with Logan about?"
"RICHARD: I was just curious about what was going on with Rory. She can be extremely taciturn."
"EMILY: What are you so curious about?"
"RICHARD: The girl spends all her time in that pool house. She's so secretive. Aren't you curious?"
"EMILY: Richard, if you want to find out what's going on in a girl's life, you most certainly do not talk to her boyfriend. Follow me."
"RICHARD: Why? Where are you going?"
"EMILY: Follow me!"
"[He gets up and follows her to the pool house.]"
"RICHARD: Emily! Is she home?"
"EMILY: No, she's out! I wouldn't burst in here like this if she were home."
"RICHARD: We should not be here, this is prowling."
"EMILY: We're not prowling, Richard! You can't prowl in your own house. This is called showing concern. [Emily begins to look through drawers.] Now, tell me what we're looking for."
"RICHARD: I don't feel good about this. It's usually this point in the John Le Carré novels where things start to go horribly wrong."
"EMILY [methodically searching the room]: Oh, don't worry. I used to do this all the time with Lorelai and the things I found. Once I opened the bottom drawer to her dresser and it was chalk full of Tootsie Rolls. Hundreds and hundreds. Practically spilling out. What could a girl possibly want with a drawer full of Tootsie Rolls?"
"RICHARD: Perhaps it was what was under the Tootsie Rolls, Emily."
"EMILY [stops suddenly]: Under the Tootsie Rolls! Oh, my God, I should have looked under the Tootsie Rolls! Oh, that's going to bother me. God knows what she had in there. [Richard peeks in the garbage can.] Let's split up. I'll hit the bedroom, you finish up in here."
"RICHARD: Well, what am I supposed to do?"
"EMILY: Check the bookcase. They love hiding things behind books."
"[Richard shrugs and begins glancing around the books."
"EMILY [OS from the bedroom]: My! This room has really come together. But we definitely should have gone with the plantation shutters. Oh, my God! Richard!"
"RICHARD: What? What's wrong?"
"EMILY [emerges from the bedroom, reverently holding Rory's purse]: The Birkin bag. All hand-made, and look at those tiny stitches! Oh, does that Logan have taste?"
"RICHARD: Okay, this is ridiculous! Let's get out of here!"
"EMILY [sniffing the bag]: Oh, and that smell!"
"RICHARD [opening the door]: Let's just go."
"EMILY: Can't you at least tell me what you were looking to find?"
"RICHARD: I don't know! It wasn't my idea to break in!"
"EMILY: Snooping without knowing what you were snooping for? Honestly, Richard."
"RICHARD: Let's just go, Emily. Now. And leave that purse!"
"EMILY: I was going to leave the purse, Richard! [He leaves. She gazes at the purse.] Twenty-one year old girl has a Birkin bag and a grown woman doesn't."
"[She goes back into the bedroom, sniffing the purse and sighs longingly.]"
"STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE"
"[Kirk is selling town souvenirs from a miniature gazebo with a sign ""Stars Hollow Visitors Centre"", he is talking to a family.]"
"KIRK: I highly recommend the miniature golf, where, coincidentally, I hold the single-round record. The property's got closed circuit, so you can forget about Mulligans."
"MAN: Thank you. [They leave.]"
"KIRK: And don't forget the giant urn at Luke's. The kids will love it. [Lorelai walks up.] Lorelai! Look. I'm sitting in a little gazebo!"
"LORELAI: I can see that, Kirk."
"KIRK: If you look real quick you might think it's the regular sized gazebo and that I'm a giant."
"LORELAI: That would be frightening."
"KIRK: Have you gotten your free map of historic Stars Hollow yet? Hot off the presses, everyone's enjoying them. [He gives her a town map.]"
"LORELAI: Maps, huh? I didn't know there were maps."
"KIRK: And can I interest you in an historic poncho or Stars Hollow kazoo?"
"LORELAI: Um, no, you really couldn't. Kirk, the Dragonfly is not on this!"
"KIRK: Right. As billed, the map only represents historic Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: But the Dragonfly is part of historic Stars Hollow!"
"KIRK: Correction. Used to be. Before you rejected your historic street name."
"LORELAI [angry]: You took me off the map!"
"KIRK: All cartographical decisions are strictly the province of the director of tourism."
"LORELAI: But you and I talked about the street names only this morning! How could the Dragonfly already be off the map?"
"KIRK: You know the old saying, cross the Don in the morning, sleep with the fishes in the afternoon. Plus Taylor has one of those really fast laser printers."
"LORELAI: This is not fair! The Dragonfly is a business in Stars Hollow! This is not right."
"KIRK: I wish there was something I could do, but I'm just a messenger. Assistant to the messenger, actually. Taylor's been clear on that. [Lorelai throws up her hands in frustration.] Okay, okay, I shouldn't do this. I'm going to look the other way. [He turns.] Take a button. One only, please."
"[Lorelai drops the map back down on the counter and leaves.]"
"LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai pulls up in the Jeep and walks to the house, there are boxes and other stuff on her front lawn. She hurry's inside to answers the phone.]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"EMILY I'm turning your bedroom into a gift-wrapping room and I have to get rid of your dollhouse. Do you want it?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Your dollhouse. It's quite cumbersome and I have absolutely no place to put it."
"LORELAI: Um, well, uh, have you checked the basement? Because I'm betting there's oodles of space down there right about now."
"EMILY: I'm doing some house cleaning, and I've only sent you things I was going to give you eventually anyway. Now, do you want the dollhouse or not?"
"LORELAI: Of course I want it!"
"EMILY: Fine. When will you come pick it up?"
"LORELAI: Well, when I can."
"EMILY: I need you to give me a time, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: I don't know! As soon as possible, okay? I'm very busy."
"EMILY: Fine. But I can't store it forever. Call me the moment you work out your schedule."
"LORELAI: Oh, I will. The very moment. [She hangs up the phone.]"
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Some kids are playing around the giant urn and one is inside it.]"
"LUKE [shouting]: Hey, you! Get away from the urn."
"[He goes back to behind the counter, Lorelai enters and sits down at the counter.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Hi."
"LORELAI: Kiss?"
"LUKE: I'm too mad."
"LORELAI: Okay. Wait, why? 'Cause you're lips would be all fiery and it would hurt?"
"LUKE [annoyed]: Did you know they changed my street name?"
"LORELAI: Uh, hello, yes, where have you been?"
"LUKE: I figured I don't have business cards, who cares? But every piece of mail I get I've got to write, change the address. Every piece of mail, because I live upstairs."
"LORELAI: I'm aware of that."
"LUKE: It's a huge hassle!"
"LORELAI: I know!"
"LUKE [holds up a letter]: And, I am in violation of ordinance twenty-two B."
"LORELAI: What is ordinance twenty-two B?"
"LUKE: Kids playing on the urn requires a jungle gym license! As stated in ordinance twenty-two B, a fine has already been levied."
"LORELAI: Ah, Taylor?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: So, wait, are you mad at Taylor again?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Yay!"
"LUKE: A jungle gym license. If I want kids playing on my urn, no one's going to tell me I need a license! [To the kids now sitting at a table] Hey, you. Go ahead! Play on the urn! [He waves the letter at Lorelai.] This stinks!"
"LORELAI: Oh my God, I'm so glad you ditched this Zen thing, because tonight at the town meeting, I'm taking it to the people and the people are going to take it to Taylor."
"LUKE: Good! Take it to him!"
"LORELAI: I've got a speech all planned, listing the years of Taylor wrongs. The abuses, the manipulations. And I'm going to get in there and make people understand that they don't have to blindly follow Taylor Doose anymore!"
"LUKE: Good, do it. They'll follow you, they like you."
"LORELAI: They do like me. I'm going to use that."
"LUKE: I'd go too, but I'd just end up throwing a bench at him."
"LORELAI: There's no need. I'll handle him."
"LUKE: You want some coffee?"
"LORELAI [tilts her head]: I'm beyond coffee."
"LUKE: Beyond coffee. This is big."
"LORELAI: I'm fuelled by my righteous indignation. I'll fill you in later."
"LUKE: I'll be here."
"LORELAI: Bye!"
"[Luke kisses Lorelai on the cheek.]"
"DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN"
"[Sookie and Michel are sitting and waiting. Lorelai enters, they both stand.]"
"SOOKIE: Hey!"
"MICHEL: How did it go?"
"LORELAI: It went great! [She gets some coffee.]"
"SOOKIE: So, come on, tell us, what happened?"
"LORELAI: Well. Before the town meeting, I stopped by Luke's, right? And he was furious! Taylor slapped him with a jungle gym fine. Smoke was pouring out of his ears. And I told him, don't worry, I am on my way to take Taylor down."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, goody."
"LORELAI: So, I go to the town meeting, it's already started, right? And I come in the back door with the squeaky track, so everybody knows Lorelai's in the house."
"MICHEL: Mm! It's very exciting!"
"LORELAI: Taylor's up there yammering about septic t*nk, and Patty made her raisin cake, and, you know, everything's just going along, when suddenly Taylor says it's time to break. And I stand up, on the bench, totally Norma Rae, and I write 'Strike' on my town meeting flier, and I hold it up, all defiant!"
"SOOKIE: Wow!"
"LORELAI: Of course the Norma Rae reference was only in my head, and everyone was very confused."
"MICHEL: Yes, it happens a lot with you."
"LORELAI: So I marched up to the front of the room and I looked this town in the eye, and I said: ""We, your Dragonfly Inn, are not on the map! We have been tossed off by Taylor jungle-gym-monitoring Doose, and it is not right, and he must be stopped!"" And since no one had heard my conversation with Luke, I lost them again for a minute, but I got them back real quickly."
"MICHEL: You really need to work on that."
"SOOKIE: Let her talk!"
"LORELAI: Anyhow, I told the town about how I had given them the best years of my life, and we've turned the Dragonfly into a class A, top notch destination inn, and that leaving us off the map was petty and mean-spirited, and just plain bad business!"
"SOOKIE: Amen! Kiss the ground, the South will rise again!"
"MICHEL: What happened then?"
"LORELAI: Then I turned to Taylor, and I said: ""Taylor Doose, if you don't put us back on the map, it will be Molly Ringwald giving her underwear to Anthony Michael Hall and he shows it to a roomful of boys who've all paid a dollar to see it."""
"MICHEL: Oh, come on!"
"LORELAI: No, that one he got! So he thought for a minute, then he stood up and he said to me: ""Lorelai, donate a hundred dollars to the Stars Hollow historical society, and I will let you back on the map and you can keep Third Street."""
"SOOKIE [eagerly]: One hundred dollars!"
"MICHEL: That's nothing! What did you say?"
"LORELAI: I said you've got a deal!"
"SOOKIE: Oh, my God! [Michel cheerfully laughs.]"
"LORELAI: And then, he said: ""Good girl"". And patted me on the head."
"SOOKIE: Oh no."
"MICHEL: Don't tell me -"
"LORELAI: We are on Sores and Boils Alley."
"MICHEL: We cannot be on Sores and Boils Alley!"
"LORELAI: Patted me on the head, Michel, like a dog."
"MICHEL: It's only a hundred dollars."
"SOOKIE: I'll pay the hundred dollars!"
"LORELAI: You're not paying the hundred dollars!"
"MICHEL: I'll pay seventy-five dollars!"
"LORELAI: Nope. No one is paying anything. We are not being extorted. We are the Inn on Sores and Boils Alley. Historical. Proud. [Her cell phone rings.]"
"MICHEL: Oozing. Festering."
"SOOKIE: Draining!"
"LORELAI: Too many words for the brochure. [Answering the phone as she walks into the dining room.] Hello?"
"EMILY: Why haven't you come to get the dollhouse yet?"
"LORELAI: Because I've been working?"
"EMILY: Well, Goodwill's picking it up at noon tomorrow so if you want it come and get it!"
"LORELAI: Well, I can't come tomorrow!"
"EMILY: Well, then, come tonight! We're up until eleven."
"LORELAI: No, mom, I'm thirty miles away and I'm busy!"
"EMILY: Then it's being donated!"
"LORELAI: You can hold onto it a little while longer!"
"EMILY: Out of the question. It's taking up space and I can't have it here."
"LORELAI: Why does Goodwill have to come at noon?"
"EMILY: Because that's the appointment I got! It's Goodwill, Lorelai, not Sotheby's!"
"LORELAI: You know, I can't believe you. You know this dollhouse means a lot to me, and I know it means a lot to you! If you want to be this mean and vindictive, then fine. Give it to Goodwill. Give it away. Light it on fire. I don't care! [She hangs up the phone.]"
"RORY'S POOL HOUSE"
"[Logan knocks on the kitchen window as Rory is makes a sandwich.]"
"RORY: Logan?"
"LOGAN: I don't think they saw me. Can you get this open?"
"RORY [opening the window]: Logan, it's okay. You can use the front door."
"LOGAN: No, this is cool. I've got a tree stump I can use as a boost out here. Or you can let down your hair."
"RORY: I talked to them."
"LOGAN: You did?"
"RORY: Yeah. It's fine. Come around to the front."
"LOGAN: Okay."
"RORY: Okay. [Closes the window goes to the door to let Logan in.] You do know that I will be mocking you for a year for trying to climb in my kitchen window."
"LOGAN: I just can't face another sit-down."
"RORY: No, it was a misunderstanding. I talked to my grandmother and my grandfather. He was not trying to pressure you. He gets that we're young and just started dating, and he's not interested in our being serious."
"LOGAN: Really?"
"RORY: Yeah. He's very sorry about the confusion."
"LOGAN: He is."
"RORY: He wants to apologize to you himself."
"LOGAN: And you're sure about this?"
"RORY: I double-super swear on my Birkin bag."
"LOGAN: Okay, that's good. This cloak and dagger stuff is getting a little tricky if you don't own a dagger and you look funny in a cloak."
"RORY: I'm sure you look great in a cloak. So everything's cool?"
"LOGAN: Everything's cool."
"RORY: Good. Logan -"
"LOGAN: Yeah?"
"RORY: I love you."
"LOGAN: Wow. [Pause.] The lady who sold that purse to me said this was going to happen."
"RORY [laughs]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spring that on you, I just - I wanted to say it, so I said it. But I don't expect anything. Believe me. I was in the position once where someone said that to me, completely out of the blue, and I was completely thrown. So, don't worry. You don't have to respond immediately. I mean, in fact, you don't have to say anything at all."
"LOGAN: Look, I've told a lot of girls that I love them before and I didn't mean it. So, I'm not going to do that to you. [Rory frowns.] Boy, that didn't come out right. It was supposed to sound a lot more -"
"RORY [smiling]: Hey, you don't have to say anything at all."
"[Logan kisses Rory.]"
"LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is sitting on the bed, Luke is helping sort through the gifts from Emily.]"
"LUKE: One antique bellows."
"LORELAI: Salvation Army."
"LUKE: Worn leather, brass studs. Wow, this thing's a real beaut."
"LORELAI: Well, either buy it a ring or move on. Next?"
"LUKE: Dough b*at, early sixties. Wow, they don't make 'em like this anymore."
"LORELAI: Salvation Army."
"LUKE: Mint condition, industrial grade, five quart capacity?"
"LORELAI: Salvation Army. [The doorbell rings and she gets up.] Oh, my pizza!"
"LUKE: Oh, there's some sort of card in here. [Reading from the card] Emily and Richard, congratulations on your wedding. Love Aunt Celeste."
"LORELAI: Thank you, Aunt Celeste. Love, the Salvation Army."
"[Lorelai answers the door.]"
"RICHARD: Hello, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hey, Dad."
"RICHARD: I thought you'd want this. [He moves aside to reveal her dollhouse sitting on the porch.]"
"LORELAI [taken aback]: Thanks. I do."
"RICHARD: And - we need to talk about Rory."
"[Lorelai takes a deep breath.]"

"(OPEN on Lorelai front porch, night right after the last scene in the previous episode. Richard is standing outside with Lorelai's dollhouse and Lorelai walks out on the porch)"
"LORELAI: What about Rory?"
"RICHARD: I don't like what I see in that girl."
"LORELAI: My eyes?"
"RICHARD: She's lost focus. She's drifting, aimless. You know she's joined the DAR?"
"LORELAI: I saw the picture in the paper."
"RICHARD: She's running around, planning tea parties like she's the mad hatter. All she talks about are seating charts and canapes and fund-raisers and that boy."
"LORELAI: You mean Logan?"
"RICHARD: She's heading in the wrong direction, and I don't like it. Now, I've thought long and hard about this, and I've come to a decision. We need a plan."
"LORELAI: But...(takes a deep breath) We...I had a plan. You changed the plan. Plan's gone, baby."
"RICHARD: I don't appreciate your tone."
"LORELAI: Apparently the proper tone went out with the plan."
"RICHARD: Do you understand what I'm saying? Rory's not headed back to school."
"LORELAI: Not yet, anyhow."
"RICHARD: Not yet? Not now, not ever. Listen to me for just a moment. We can fix this. First of all, I can change the terms of Rory's trust fund. Currently, she's set to receive it when she turns twenty-five, but I say we tell her it's contingent on her returning to Yale."
"LORELAI: Dad..."
"RICHARD: Or we can use the opposite approach, if you think it's better. Maybe we offer her a car or the down payment on a town house. Or I'll buy her the town house. Don't you see? If there's something in it for her, maybe we can get her to change her mind."
"LORELAI: Thank you for the dollhouse, dad. It's greatly appreciated."
"RICHARD: I don't believe this. Aren't you listening to me?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, Rory is turning twenty-one years old in ten days. Do you realize that?"
"LORELAI: Yes, dad, I realize it."
"RICHARD: She's twenty-one. That's not a child. Twenty-one-year-olds need to be working towards something."
"LORELAI: Rory will figure it out."
"RICHARD: Oh, please, she's twenty-one. I couldn't tie my shoe at twenty-one."
"LORELAI: Well, Rory's advanced. She had the shoe thing down at three."
"RICHARD: I'm getting a little tired..."
"LORELAI: No, I'm getting a little tired of this conversation. I'm not interested in your plan. I'm not going to bribe my daughter with cars and money, mainly because it wouldn't work, and if you'd ever met Rory, you would know it wouldn't work. Rory can't be bought, and I'm not gonna try and buy her. I want Rory to want to go back to school. She used to love to learn and read and study. And that was freakish, but it was her. And she's got to get herself back there."
"RICHARD: But..."
"LORELAI: No, when Rory wants help, she will ask for it. And the minute she does, I will fly in faster than the gulfstream I'm sure you're gonna offer to buy her next. But until then, I'm sorry, you're on your own."
"RICHARD: Impossible girl."
"LORELAI: My native American name, I believe. (Richard leaves frustrated)"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"(CUT on Lorelai's front porch, same night. Luke is trying to lift the dollhouse as Lorelai stands near by)"
"LORELAI: Unbelievable. He's unbelievable."
"LUKE: He sure is. How did he lift this thing?"
"LORELAI: Pretending like it's an accident that Rory's still floundering. Nothing's an accident. He caused this. He made this happen."
"LUKE: It must weigh a thousand pounds."
"LORELAI: That was a low blow, bringing up Rory's birthday like that. ""She's turning twenty-one, Lorelai. Did you know that?"". (she scoffs) Of course I know that. I was there when she was turning nothing. I know she's turning twenty-one."
"LUKE: Does this thing have, like, a real foundation or something?"
"LORELAI: It's just like my parents, you know, to double-cross me then get mad when I won't help them undo the double cross."
"LUKE: Did he have guys with him?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Guys, to help him lift this thing."
"LORELAI: No, no guys."
"LUKE: No guys? Your dad is Hercules."
"LORELAI: We had plans."
"LUKE: (grunts as he tries to pick the dollhouse up) What? (Lorelai sits on the porch rail)"
"LORELAI: We were gonna go to Atlantic City. We were gonna sit at a blackjack table at 11:59, we were gonna order martinis, and we were gonna be playing 21 when she turned twenty-one. (Luke walks over to her) And then hopefully we'd win, and we'd take our winnings and we'd buy 21 things. And then there was a thing about 21 guys that wouldn't really be appropriate anymore since the engagement, but it was a good plan. (Luke starts to play with Lorelai's hair in a comforting way) She probably doesn't even remember the plan."
"LUKE: She remembers the plan."
"LORELAI: It wasn't like we talked about it every day. It was just something we thought of."
"LUKE: She remembers the plan."
"LORELAI: I'm hungry. I'm ordering pizza. (they hug and Luke kisses the top of her head) The top comes off. (Lorelai goes in the house)"
"LUKE: Of course it does."
"(CUT to Rory's room, night. Rory is lying in bed sleeping and the clock says the time is 4:03 in the morning. Madeleine Albright walks over and kisses the top of her head. Rory wakes up and Madeleine Albright lies in bed with Rory)"
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Happy birthday, little girl."
"RORY: Hey."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I can't believe how fast you're growing up."
"RORY: Really? Feels slow."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Trust me, it's fast. So, what do you think of your life so far?"
"RORY: I think it's pretty good."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Any complaints?"
"RORY: I'd like that whole humidity thing to go away."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I'll work on that."
"RORY: So, do I look older?"
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Oh, yeah. Walk into Denny's before five, you got yourself a discount."
"RORY: Good deal."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: So, you know what I think?"
"RORY: What?"
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think you're a great, cool kid and the best friend a girl could have."
"RORY: Back at ya."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: And it's so hard to believe that, at exactly this time many moons ago, I was lying in exactly the same position."
"RORY: Oh, boy, here we go."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Only I had a fat stomach and huge ankles and I was swearing like a sailor..."
"RORY: ...on leave."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: On leave, right. And there I was..."
"RORY: ...in labour..."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: ...and while there's some who call it the most meaningful experience of their life..."
"RORY: ...you compare it to something more akin to doing the splits on a crate of dynamite."
"MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: Right."
"RORY: I wonder if the Waltons ever did this."
"(CUT to Rory and Logan in bed, continuous. Rory wakes up - so obviously she was dreaming. Logan wakes up a bit too)"
"LOGAN: What?"
"RORY: I just had a dream that Madeleine Albright was my mother."
"LOGAN: Hmm. (Logan falls back to sleep. Rory sighs and follows his lead, looking a bit preoccupied)"
"(CUT to Stars Hollow outside, morning. Lorelai is walking down the street and sees Morey and Babette coming out of the market each of them holding quite a few bags)"
"LORELAI: Hey, there."
"BABETTE: Oh, hi, sugar. Couldn't see you over the bags."
"LORELAI: Wow, you got a lot of stuff there. You hunkering down for winter?"
"BABETTE: Nah, we're getting our supplies for our gallows."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, you're gonna hang Morey again?"
"MOREY: Do it every year."
"LORELAI: You're always the hit of the neighbourhood."
"BABETTE: So, what about you, honey? What are you gonna do?"
"LORELAI: Oh, you know, the same thing I always do."
"BABETTE: (disappointed) Oh. Gonna hang caramel apples from the tree again?"
"LORELAI: The kids love 'em."
"BABETTE: Yeah. They're not that scary."
"LORELAI: Well, to a diabetic, they're downright terrifying."
"BABETTE: Huh? Okay. Caramel apples."
"LORELAI: And I will be handing out candy, which, you know, is the entire point of Halloween."
"BABETTE: Sure. Sure, honey. Well, we got a lot to do. We got to go."
"MOREY: No rest for the doomed."
"BABETTE: See you later. (Babette and Morey start to walk off as Lorelai calls after them)"
"LORELAI: You know, I-I-I bought a haunted house CD to play in the background. (Babette politely laughs a bit and she and Morey walk away, as Lorelai leaves looking a bit pissed)"
"(CUT to pool house, evening. Rory and Logan are making out on the couch. Rory breaks the kiss for a bit)"
"RORY: What time is our reservation?"
"LOGAN: Now."
"RORY: Oh. It's amazing what happens when you can't find your keys."
"LOGAN: I think we should order in tonight."
"RORY: And the purse is down."
"(Rory throws the Birking bag on the floor and the continue smooching. After a bit there is a knock on the door)"
"RORY: Who is it?"
"EMILY (OS): Emily Gilmore. (the kids get off the couch and Rory gets the door and lets Emily in)"
"EMILY: I'm so sorry to bother you, Rory. Hello, Logan."
"LOGAN: Hello, Emily."
"EMILY: Rory, could you check your closets? The maid hung up your dry cleaning today and I am missing a blouse, and I want to know whether or not to add this to the list of reasons I'm firing her."
"RORY: Of course. I'll be right back. (she walks off to the bedroom)"
"EMILY: Thank you, Rory. I'm so exhausted with incompetent people, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like every person I hire immediately gets hit in the head with a mallet on their way out of the employment office. (quickly and quietly to Logan) Logan, do you have anything special planned for Rory's birthday next week?"
"LOGAN: Uh...no, no plans."
"EMILY: Oh, good. Because I would love to throw her a party here. A 21st birthday is so special. But I didn't want to order twelve pounds of crab legs if you had plans to whisk her off to Santorini."
"LOGAN: No whisking plans in the works."
"RORY: (walking back out form the bedroom) Sorry, grandma, your blouse isn't in there."
"EMILY: Say, Rory, how would you like a birthday party next week?"
"RORY: Oh, well..."
"EMILY: It doesn't have to be a big, formal affair. Just something fun with your friends and a few of the DAR ladies, whoever you want."
"RORY: Sure, grandma, a party sounds fine."
"EMILY: I'll go right in and call the caterers. 21 years old...time flies, doesn't it? All right, you two, back to what you were doing. (Emily walks out and Rory starts to lead Logan back to the couch)"
"RORY: Hey, grandma says."
"LOGAN: So, a 21st birthday. Big event."
"RORY: I guess."
"LOGAN: Would've been nice if I had known about it."
"RORY: Oh, I didn't tell you?"
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: Oh. I'm just not into birthdays."
"LOGAN: You're not into birthdays? You, who wore green head to toe on St.Patrick's day and bunny ears on Easter?"
"RORY: I have stock in hallmark."
"LOGAN: What's up, Ace?"
"RORY: We should probably call the restaurant if we still want to try and eat there."
"LOGAN: Ace."
"RORY: I'm just not excited about this particular birthday."
"LOGAN: Why not?"
"RORY: Because I'm turning 21."
"LOGAN: Yes...?"
"RORY: My mom and I have been planning for my 21st birthday since, well, my first memory is kindergarten, but I have a feeling she was talking about it before then. We had this whole big thing planned."
"LOGAN: Yeah...?"
"RORY: We were gonna go to Atlantic City and sit at a blackjack table at 11:59, and we'd be playing 21 when I turned 21. We were gonna drink martinis and win money and go buy 21 things, and there was this thing including 21 guys that would be totally inappropriate now that I'm with you. But it was a pretty big thing, and...and now we're not talking, so it's not gonna happen. I'm just a little bummed. That's all."
"LOGAN: I know you miss your mom. The concept's a little hard for me to grasp, but I know you do. (he sits)"
"RORY: Well, you never got to know her. She can be pretty cool."
"LOGAN: Hey, I know. I'll take you to Atlantic City."
"RORY: What?"
"LOGAN: We can still play 21 when you turn 21. We can buy the 21 things. I'd still vote to put the kibosh on that thing with the 21 guys. But other than that, I'm good to go."
"RORY: You're sweet, but it's OK. (she sits next to him)"
"LOGAN: Come on. We'll get a car. 21 cars, if you like."
"RORY: No. No, I appreciate the offer a lot, but I'll just have the party and let this birthday pass."
"LOGAN: You sure?"
"RORY: Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. And I'm hungry. You ready to go? (she picks the Birkin bag from the floor and stands up. Logan doesn't follow) Where did I put my keys?"
"LOGAN: Oh, I think I saw them on the couch."
"RORY: Here we go again. (she sits next to him again and they start making out again)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion dinning room, morning. Emily and Rory are sitting at the table, with all sorts of pieces of birthday cake, which Rory's trying, flowers, napkins and invitation cards. The seem to be planning the party)"
"EMILY: (talks as Rory eats on of the cake samples distracted) You know, when I was turning 21, I somehow got it into my head that I simply had to have my invitations trimmed with real pearls. I could not be convinced that it was at all tacky or impractical. I was right, and that was the way it had to be. My mother was beside herself. I never heard so much sighing in my whole life. But in the end, she found me invitations lined with real pearls, and I felt like the most important girl in the world. So, come on, tell me, which ones are your pearl-trimmed invitations? Rory!"
"RORY: Hmm?"
"EMILY: You're supposed to try them all."
"RORY: What?"
"EMILY: The cake. Alfonso made us those samples. The least we can do is try them all."
"RORY: Oh, OK, sure. (takes a forkful from another cake)"
"EMILY: Well, I like the lace. Do you like the lace?"
"RORY: Sure."
"EMILY: All right. The lace it is. Now, the food. I think we should go buffet. Much more youthful. And what do you think of sushi? Sushi feels young, doesn't it?"
"RORY: I certainly hope so. You don't want any old sushi hanging around."
"EMILY: Now, we'll have a bar, heaters on the patio to stem the crowd. Oh, do you want a special tray-passed drink, like a sidecar maybe or a gin fizz? I used to love a nice gin fizz. (noticing Rory isn't paying attention) Am I boring you?"
"RORY: No, the lace is fine."
"EMILY: Rory, where is your head today?"
"RORY: I don't know. I'm sorry."
"EMILY: There are a million other little details I need to go over here. Would you like me to just do it myself?"
"RORY: Um, sure. You've got great taste. I trust you completely."
"EMILY: All right. Then the only thing I need from you is a little guidance on the guest list. Now, I have the information for the DAR ladies, of course, and Logan. I have Logan's information. I believe I have the address of your Asian friend."
"RORY: Lane."
"EMILY: She hasn't moved?"
"RORY: Not that I know of."
"EMILY: All right"
"RORY: She'll want to bring her boyfriend."
"EMILY: Her boyfriend? How wonderful. Rory's Asian friend..."
"RORY: Lane!"
"EMILY: ...has a boyfriend. All right. Now, what about Paris? Are you two friends? I never really can tell."
"RORY: Paris should be on the list."
"EMILY: Then Paris is on the list."
"RORY: She'll want to bring her boyfriend, too."
"EMILY: My goodness. I guess there's something in the air. All right. I have the Cheevers, your cousins from Bridgeport. Now, do you want me to put your mother on this list?"
"RORY: Mom?"
"EMILY: It's completely up to you. I just thought I should ask."
"RORY: Yes, put mom on the list."
"EMILY: All right. She's on the list."
"RORY: And the chocolate praline crunch is the cake."
"EMILY: A chocolate praline crunch cake. (wistful) A chocolate praline crunch cake completely covered with pearls. Ah, to be 21 again."
"(CUT to outside Lorelai's house, night. Lorelai drives up and gets out of the car. Morey and Babette are prepping for Halloween)"
"LORELAI: Wow! Looks great, guys."
"BABETTE: Yeah, we made it bigger this year. And we added a great new light effect to help Morey's face look more distorted when he drops because, you know, when you really get hanged, your eyeballs sometimes explode and your tongue splits down the middle. It's disgusting. Wanna see?"
"LORELAI: Uh..."
"BABETTE: Morey, shake a leg."
"MOREY: Okay. (takes his spot and puts his head in the rope) All set."
"BABETTE: Okay! b*mb away! (pulls a lever and Morey falls)"
"LORELAI: OH!"
"BABETTE: Now, remember, you got to twitch around a lot, make the kids think you're dying real slow and painful."
"MOREY: Okay"
"BABETTE: Now, obviously there'll be some blood sh**ting out and some screams, but you get the picture."
"LORELAI: I-I-I do."
"MOREY: (twitching around a bit, obviously uncomfortable) Babette? Tight, babe."
"LORELAI: Do you need help, Babette?"
"BABETTE: Oh, no. As soon as he passes out, his muscles relax and I can slide him right out. We'll be good."
"LORELAI: Okay. See you guys later. (walks off to the house)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house inside, continuous. Lorelai comes in and makes her way to the kitchen, where Luke is cooking)"
"LORELAI: Luke, are you here?"
"LUKE: In the kitchen."
"LORELAI: Where's Paul Anka? He didn't meet me at the door."
"LUKE: Peas scare him."
"LORELAI: Really? Huh. Peas? (puts down her purse, takes off her coat and looks at a list on the fridge) Cooked or raw?"
"LUKE: Doesn't seem pleased with either form."
"LORELAI: Okay, peas are out. (writes something - peas - on the list) What smells so good?"
"LUKE: Fried chicken."
"LORELAI: Luke, will you marry me?"
"LUKE: Set the table?"
"LORELAI: Okay, first, I have some very exciting news to tell you."
"LUKE: sh**t! (Lorelai starts to take things out to lay the table)"
"LORELAI: This year, I have decided do a whole new thing for Halloween."
"LUKE: You're not gonna hang the caramel apples again?"
"LORELAI: Caramel apples aren't scary."
"LUKE: Well, what's scary is you opening your house up to a mob of insane, sugar-laced kids wearing masks that conviently hide any identifying features."
"LORELAI: I have decided to do something totally different, and I'm gonna need your help."
"LUKE: Sure."
"LORELAI: Okay. I want to do a skit."
"LUKE: Skit?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I want to be a mad scientist. I'm gonna come out in a blood-stained white lab coat and freaky makeup and big, giant, Don King kind of hairdo, and I'm going to turn the whole front yard into my laboratory."
"LUKE: Wow."
"LORELAI: Yes, I'm gonna have a huge electric chair and an operating table and test tubes and wires."
"LUKE: Sounds elaborate."
"LORELAI: But you haven't heard the half of it, okay? And so I come out and I do mad scientist ""banter"", like, ""Hey, who here is from Bellevue?"" and ""'Girl Interrupted'? Now that's my idea of a feel-good movie"". I'll work on it. But anyway, after that, I'm gonna drag you out."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: You're strapped in an electric chair, and I'm gonna throw the switch and totally electrocute you. And you're flailing around. We'll rig something where smoke and sparks sh**t out of your nose. And then once you're dead, I'll throw you onto the operating table and I'll cut you open, and I pull link sausages out of you and throw them into the crowd."
"LUKE: That's it?"
"LORELAI: Well, I mean, we can take a bow or something, but, yeah, that's it."
"LUKE: Okay. Uh, just a couple of questions here. Once you've electrocuted me, and I'm dead, um, how exactly do I get to the operating table?"
"LORELAI: huh. Good question. Maybe I can position the operating table like right near the electric chair so I can just flop you over onto it after you die."
"LUKE: Okay, let's say we work that out. Now I'm on the table. You're gonna cut me open with what?"
"LORELAI: A big, rusty saw."
"LUKE: And then you're gonna pull link sausages out of me."
"LORELAI: Real slow and creepy like."
"LUKE: Okay, great. Last question. Uh, what are the odds of you getting me to do a skit where you electrocute me, cut me open, and pull link sausages out of me? 'Cause I'm thinking they're right up there with Pia Zadora making a big comeback."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on. This will be fun."
"LUKE: No way, not happening."
"LORELAI: But this is our first Halloween together as a full-blown, committed, soon-to-be-married couple. We need to start our own traditions."
"LUKE: Tell you what. I'll build you the chair, help with the test tubes, and then I'm done."
"LORELAI: But you would be so scary with smoke coming out of your nose. I really want to see that."
"LUKE: Well, we're gonna be together the rest of our lives, so odds are you will."
"LORELAI: Luke!"
"LUKE: Chicken's burning. I got to concentrate. Why don't you go find your psychotic dog, and I'll set the table?"
"LORELAI: Okay, but this discussion is not over. (walks over to the fridge and takes out some raw broccoli) Here, Paul Anka. Mommy's got your broccoli. (walks out of the kitchen to find PA)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion driveway, night. Logan's car pulls up. We CUT in the car. Logan is dropping Rory off)"
"LOGAN: Out."
"RORY: Oh, come on."
"LOGAN: b*at it!"
"RORY: I can't believe you're not gonna come in."
"LOGAN: I told you I'm meeting my father at 7:30 in the morning in New York."
"RORY: I loved the dinner tonight."
"LOGAN: I'm glad."
"RORY: I've never had Sri Lankan food before."
"LOGAN: I thought you'd like it."
"RORY: And I appreciate you lying to me and answering ""chicken"" every time I asked you what I was eating."
"LOGAN: Well, fifteen courses. One of them was bound to be chicken."
"RORY: And that dessert."
"LOGAN: Do you really think you can keep talking long enough that I forget I can't come in?"
"RORY: Well, I've seen my mom do it before. I thought maybe it was a family trait. (Logan leans over her and they kiss) Just for an hour."
"LOGAN: No. (Rory leans in a gain and kisses him)"
"RORY: Half an hour?"
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: Fifteen minutes?"
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: Okay, an hour."
"LOGAN: You're getting better at this. (they start making out and then someone - Richard knocks on Logan's window. They break the kiss quickly and pull away from each other)"
"RORY: Ow, you bit my lip. (Logan lowers his window)"
"RICHARD: I didn't mean to startle you two. I heard a noise out here and just came to check it out. Everything all right?"
"LOGAN: Everything is fine Richard, I was just dropping Rory off."
"RORY: Hi, Grandpa."
"RICHARD: Hello, Rory. Well, I'll just say good night, then."
"RORY: Good night, Grandpa."
"LOGAN: Good night, Richard. (Richard smiles and leaves)"
"(CUT to inside Gilmore mansion, continuous. Emily is looking at a catalogue as Richard comes in)"
"EMILY: Was it the Mortigans' Dalmatian trying to mate with our lion statues again?"
"RICHARD: No, it was not the Mortigans' Dalmatian. It was Rory and Logan. (he sots opposite her)"
"EMILY: How natural selection hasn't wiped out dogs like that, I'll never know. Rory and Logan?"
"RICHARD: It was Rory and Logan. They just came home. Logan was dropping Rory off."
"EMILY: Well, that's nice. Oh, look at this bedroom set. Richard, you would love these pillows."
"RICHARD: Seems I interrupted their goodbyes."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard, now they're going to think we were spying on them. This settee is lovely, also."
"RICHARD: They were engaged in a round of serious necking."
"EMILY: What do you mean?"
"RICHARD: You know exactly what I mean."
"EMILY: You know, Richard, Rory's growing up."
"RICHARD: Mm-hmm."
"EMILY: She's turning 21 next week."
"RICHARD: Oh. Is that what the flotilla of party planners outside our door was about?"
"EMILY: Logan is certainly a very experienced young man."
"RICHARD: Man of the world, Emily, man of the world."
"EMILY: You know, Richard, it might be that time."
"RICHARD: What time?"
"EMILY: She might be getting ready to have relations with that boy."
"RICHARD: Oh, Emily, please. Have you seen the size of that sports car of his? There's no room to cross your legs, much less anything else."
"EMILY: The car is not the only place they're getting affectionate, Richard. I walked in on them the other day in the pool house. They were very cozy on the couch, and they certainly weren't looking for her keys."
"RICHARD: Do you really think?"
"EMILY: I really think."
"RICHARD: Oh, we have to do something. If she's getting ready to take that step, we have to do something."
"EMILY: I couldn't agree more."
"RICHARD: Tomorrow."
"EMILY: Tomorrow. I am in love with this bedroom set."
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, morning. Sookie and Lorelai are looking at sausages)"
"SOOKIE: Okay! So...what kind of link sausage would you like to pull out of Luke?"
"LORELAI: I'm not sure. Nothing too wimpy. Luke's a big guy, so he needs big-guy sausage."
"SOOKIE: Don't we all."
"LORELAI: Don't make my man's sausage dirty."
"SOOKIE: Well, you could go kielbasa. That's a big-guy sausage."
"LORELAI: I guess. Technically, Luke hasn't agreed to let me pull anything out of him."
"SOOKIE: Small detail."
"LORELAI: Minuscule roadblock."
"SOOKIE: Well, personally, I love the Louisiana sweet sausage 'cause it has the nicest flavour. A little bite, but not too overwhelming."
"LORELAI: But, I'm not gonna eat the sausage. I'm going to pull it out of Luke. (an Dragonfly employee comes in the kitchen holding an envelope)"
"RON: Mail just came."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks, Ron."
"SOOKIE: Well, if you're just going by looks, I'd go Cajun because it's red. (they both chuckle as Lorelai opens the envelope - Rory's party invitation) What's the matter?"
"LORELAI: Nothing."
"SOOKIE: It's not nothing."
"LORELAI: It's an invitation to Rory Gilmore's 21st birthday party."
"SOOKIE: Wow, look at all that lace. Man, that's a pretty invitation."
"LORELAI: Sure is."
"SOOKIE: Are you going to go?"
"LORELAI: This isn't from Rory. This is from my Dad via my Mom."
"SOOKIE: It is?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes. It's just my Dad trying to manipulate me and get me involved in a plan to manipulate Rory."
"SOOKIE: But you had a plan."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: Boy, they are determined."
"LORELAI: Determined, demented, de-lovely."
"SOOKIE: I can't believe Rory's turning 21. It seems like just yesterday she was crying because you told her Charlotte Bronte couldn't come to her sleepover because she's dead."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna go check the reservation book."
"SOOKIE: Too much Rory talk."
"LORELAI: Oh, just a tad. It's making me bummed, so..."
"SOOKIE: We could go back to our sausage talk."
"LORELAI: Maybe later. (Lorelai exits the kitchen)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, night. Emily is serving drinks as Rory comes in from the patio and walk up to Emily)"
"RORY: Oh, my god, it smells good in here."
"EMILY; Well, I see someone got our dinner invitation."
"RORY: Yes, I did, and thank you. It's been weeks since I've had anything that hasn't been supersized for dinner."
"EMILY: Well, you've been so busy lately, I had to resort to pot roast and mashed potatoes to get you here."
"RORY: Pot roast and mashed potatoes?"
"EMILY: With baby carrots, parker house rolls, and ice cream sundaes for dessert."
"RORY: Wow. Am I dying?"
"EMILY: Would you grab that bottle of wine? (walks off with two drinks in her hand)"
"RORY: Sure. (grabs the wine and follows Emily)"
""
""
""
"(CUT to dinning room, continuous. Emily and Rory enter. Richard is seated at the table, but he's not alone. A man - Rev.Boatwright - is with him)"
"RICHARD: Rory, how lovely that you could join us. Do you know the Reverend Boatwright?"
"RORY: Uh, no."
"EMILY: Oh, I can't believe that. Reverend Boatwright has been our minister for years. By now he's more of a friend than a minister."
"RORY: Well, it's nice to meet you, Reverend Boatwright."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Well, it's nice to meet you, too, Rory. I hear pot roast is your favourite, too."
"RORY: Yes, it is."
"EMILY: (as she takes her seat) Rory, sit, sit. (Rory sits) It's amazing. All the wonderful foods in this world, the greatest chefs with the most exotic ingredients, and yet this girl still wants pot roast. Roll, reverend?"
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Well, thank you. Don't mind if I do."
"EMILY: Hmm. I wonder where that salad is. Will you excuse me? I'll be right back. (gets up and exits the dinning room)"
"RICHARD: You know, Emily ordered some of that wonderful Irish butter. You haven't tasted rolls until you've had them with Irish butter. I'll be right back. (gets up and exits the dinning room)"
"RORY: And then there were two."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Your grandparents have told me a lot about you, Rory."
"RORY: Oh, yeah?"
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: They're very proud of you, you know."
"RORY: Well, then it's a mutual admiration society."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: You have a birthday coming up next week?"
"RORY: Twenty first."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Must be wonderful being a young woman, just turning 21. The world is out there, just waiting to be conquered."
"RORY: I guess so."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: I hear you have a boyfriend."
"RORY: Yes."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Ah, young love. It can be so exhilarating, so intense. All those feelings rushing around inside of you. I remember being young and having all those crazy feelings."
"RORY: Oh, yeah?"
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Oh, yes. You know, Rory, being a young lady comes with many gifts. Your virtue, for example, is a gift, a precious gift. Possibly the most precious gift you possess."
"RORY: (looking the way Emily and Richard went off) Uh-huh."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: You want to give this gift very carefully. It is a gift you can give to only one man. Once you give it, it's gone. You can't re-gift it. If you give it away too soon to the wrong man, then when the right one does come along, you have no gift to give. You'll have to buy him a sweater. Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"RORY: No."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Think long and hard about when and to whom you want to give the ultimate gift you have to give away."
"RORY: Oh."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Yes."
"RORY: Oh, dear."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Oh, dear, indeed."
"RORY: Um...well, (chuckles a bit uncomfortably) listen, Reverend. I really appreciate you taking the time out of what I assume is a busy day to come here and talk to me about...all of this, but, um, I'm afraid the ultimate-gift ship has sailed."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: What?"
"RORY: A while ago. It's probably in Fiji by now."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Oh."
"RORY: Yeah."
"Rev.BOATWRIGHT: Well..."
"RORY: So, have you seen ""The 40-year-old Virgin""? 'Cause you might like it."
"(CUT to outside of the pool house, morning. Rory is walking up to the pool house after her community service, takes out her keys and unlocks the door, but has trouble opening it. When she manages, she sees that inside the place id full of stuff. She looks around stunned and then runs off)"
"(CUT to inside mansion continuous. People are prepping up the house for the party. Emily talking to the planner - Claire - as Rory comes in)"
"EMILY: Well, it can't go next to the sushi, so I guess the cake will have to go in there. Maybe in the corner?"
"CLAIRE: Sounds good"
"RORY: Grandma."
"EMILY: Oh, Rory, good. Do you think we should have a carving station in case some people find sushi unappealing, or will the passed hors d'oeuvres be enough?"
"RORY: Either way."
"EMILY: ""Either way"" is not an opinion Rory, just for future reference. (at Claire) Let's have a carving station. Just beef, no turkey."
"RORY: What happened to the pool house?"
"EMILY: What do you mean?"
"RORY: It's full of stuff."
"EMILY: Oh, yes, the rentals. I had absolutely nowhere to put them. They said it might rain tonight, and we couldn't leave them outside, so I just put them in the pool house."
"RORY: But I live in the pool house. What am I supposed to do?"
"EMILY: Oh, I packed up your things and put them in your old room upstairs."
"RORY: Upstairs?"
"EMILY: Uh-huh. The room right next to ours. We can knock secret-code messages to each other at night, like we're in camp. (notices something in the other room and yells at someone) No, I didn't tell you to put that there. You're fired."
"RORY: Grandma, has mom RSVP'ed?"
"EMILY: I don't know, Rory. Check the list. (as Rory checks the list Emily talk to the worker she was previously fired) Yes, out now, please. Thank you."
"RORY: The list says no."
"EMILY: Then I guess the answer's ""no""."
"RORY: Well, that's just wrong. When an invitations says ""RSVP"", you RSVP. That's what you do. It's not rocket science."
"EMILY: Maybe she's still coming."
"RORY: But how do we know? If she doesn't call, how will we know whether or not to make an extra chocolate box, huh? If she doesn't call, she won't have a chocolate box."
"EMILY: We can make an extra chocolate box, Rory."
"RORY: No. Why should we make an extra chocolate box? I mean, we're paying for these things. Chocolate boxes do not just grow on trees. They are made. They're made by these hardworking people right here, and it is not right to make these people spend hours making extra chocolate boxes because people are too lazy to make a stupid phone call! (exits very upset)"
"EMILY: Rory!"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Lorelai is sitting at the counter, putting LOTS of whipped cream on a pancake. Luke is behind the counter watching her)"
"LUKE: You're gonna be sick."
"LORELAI: No."
"LUKE: It's already loaded with chocolate chips. That's candy, and you're adding whipped cream. That's more candy."
"LORELAI: Got any jelly beans?"
"LUKE: I'm gonna be sick. (the telephone rings)"
"LORELAI: Oh, and a cherry. (Luke answers the phone)"
"LUKE: Luke's."
"RORY (on the phone): Luke, is my mother there?"
"LUKE: Rory?"
"LORELAI: Rory?"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion patio. Rory is on the phone. The scene cuts between Luke and Lorelai in the dinner and Rory at the patio)"
"RORY: Yes, it's Rory. Is my mother there?"
"LORELAI: That's Rory?"
"LUKE: I'll give her to you."
"LORELAI: To me? That's Rory for me?"
"RORY: No! I just want to know if she's coming to my birthday party."
"LUKE: She wants to know if you're coming to her birthday party."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: We're making the chocolate boxes right now, and I need to know if she's coming so I know whether or not to make her one."
"LUKE: They're making the chocolate boxes right now, and she needs to know if you're coming so they can make you one."
"LORELAI: I didn't know I was invited."
"RORY: I sent her an invitation! Where the hell did she think it came from?! The invitation fairy!?"
"LUKE: She said she sent you an invitation."
"LORELAI: I didn't know it was from her. (a bit louder and closer to the phone, Luke holds the phone up for her) I didn't know it was from you!"
"RORY: Well, it was. Is she coming or not?"
"LUKE: Are you coming or not?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I-I'm coming. I want a chocolate box."
"LUKE: She'll be there."
"RORY: Fine. Bye. (hangs up)"
"LORELAI: Rory called."
"LUKE: I know. She called and yelled at me."
"LORELAI: No, she called and yelled at me."
"LUKE: Yeah, but I'm the one who had to hear it, and she was loud. And she said ""hell"". I never heard her say ""hell"". I didn't even know she knew how to say ""hell"". She was mad and she yelled and she said ""hell""."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but she called."
"(CUT to Rory's bedroom, night. It's 4:03 am on Rory's birthday, and Rory is awake looking sadly at her clock)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's bed, night. It's 4:03 am on Rory's birthday, and Lorelai is awake looking sadly at her clock)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, night of the party. Waiters are prepping up the house for the party, there are a few guests. Emily is walking around inspecting things)"
"EMILY: Keep those fans going. I don't want the whole house to smell of raw fish. Disgusting food. (welcoming two guests) Shelby, Martin, how wonderful that you've come."
"SHELBY: We're a bit early, I'm afraid."
"EMILY: Nonsense. Have a ""rory"". We'll chat later. (as she walks away from them) Tacky, horrid people. Why not just show up the night before with a sleeping bag? (as the doorbell rings Emily gives some instructions to the maid) May-May, you've got to get it down to a 1-bell answer. Bell rings once, door opens. Please help me on this. Mr. Gilmore is not here yet, and therefore I have no one to help me with the guests or the party. So, just make sure you get the door after one bell. (the doorbell rings) That's two bells. (as it rings again, Emily starts getting mad) That's three bells! (the maid quickly opens the door) Well, hello, Glory. Come in, come in. (the gusts come in and Emily notices as Rory comes down from upstairs and walks up to her) Rory, you look wonderful. That dress is to die for."
"RORY: Well, it's the one you laid out on the bed, so I assumed I was supposed to put it on."
"EMILY: Well, it's perfect. So, how does it look?"
"RORY: Fine."
"EMILY: I'll never forgive myself for being talked into votives, but that's what you get for taking calls at cocktail hour. Have you tried your drink?"
"RORY: My what? (Emily snaps her fingers and waiter comes up with a tray)"
"EMILY: Your signature drink. (takes a martini glass filled with a pink drink from the tray and offers it to Rory) I had the bartender concoct it for you. It's called ""rory"". It's got champagne, vodka, pineapple juice, and grenadine. Have one. You're old enough now."
"RORY: Maybe later. Empty stomach."
"EMILY: Well, there's plenty to eat, so that can be remedied."
"RORY: Where's Grandpa?"
"EMILY: He'll be here soon. (Logan walks up to them)"
"LOGAN: Well, there they are. The two most lovely ladies in the room."
"EMILY: (rather coldly) Hello, Logan. I have to check on your cake. (walks away)"
"LOGAN: Huh. Is it me or could the penguins march through here?"
"RORY: She's probably mad because she found out we're having sex."
"LOGAN: She what?"
"RORY: She found out we're having sex."
"LOGAN: How the hell did she find that out?"
"RORY: I told her minister."
"LOGAN: But-but why would you do that?"
"RORY: Because he was going on and on about my virtue being a gift. And now you have it, so I'm gonna have to buy the next guy a sweater. I just wanted him to stop."
"LOGAN: And all this without a drink in my hand."
"RORY: Come on. Let's get you a ""rory"". (they start walking towards the bar)"
"LOGAN: Ohh, dealing with this family is stressful."
"RORY: Oh! (chuckles) Tell me about it. And once you've had that drink, I can tell you how I've been moved out of the pool house and into a room right next to my grandparents. So from now on, we'll have to have sex in our invisible suits. (at the bartender) Two rories, please."
"LOGAN: Does your grandfather know, also?"
"RORY: Oh, yeah."
"LOGAN: (at bartender) Make it four."
"LANE: (comes in dragging Zack behind her) Rory!"
"RORY: You came!"
"LANE: Of course I came. I wouldn't miss your 21st birthday. (they hug)"
"RORY: Oh, I'm glad. Hey, Zack, thanks for coming."
"ZACK: Sure, no problem. There's food, right?"
"RORY: Oh, plenty of food. Lane, I want you to meet Logan. Logan, this is my best friend, Lane."
"LOGAN: Hey, nice to finally meet you. (they shake hands)"
"LANE: Nice to finally meet you, too. (Lane mouths to Rory ""He's cute"" and Rory responds ""I know"") And this is my boyfriend, Zack."
"LOGAN: (offers Zack a handshake) How you doing?"
"ZACK: What? (sees his hand and they shake) Oh, I'm hanging in there."
"LOGAN: You guys want a drink?"
"ZACK: Well, I'm not sharing, so make it two drinks. (Logan turns over to the bar to order)"
"LANE: Wow, this house is amazing. I've never been here before."
"RORY: I'll give you a tour."
"BARTENDER: Two rories. Extra cherries for the lady."
"LANE: Oh, my god, you have your own drink. (Rory give Lane a rory)"
"RORY: Wait till you see the bathroom. The guest soap has my face on it. (the girls walk off ahead as Logan gives Zack a rory)"
"ZACK: So, you're, like, rich, huh?"
"LOGAN: Uh... (the boys follow the girls)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion driveway, night of the party. Luke and Lorelai are walking up to the house. Lorelai is holding a present)"
"LUKE: This might be my least favourite door in the world to knock on."
"LORELAI: What about death's door?"
"LUKE: The reception on the other side might be warmer. (Lorelai nods a bit. As Luke is about to knock on the door it opens)"
"LORELAI: Well, at least you didn't have to knock."
"LUKE: Ready?"
"LORELAI: I was born ready."
"(they enter the house)"
"LUKE: Ah, nice, low-key affair."
"LORELAI: Okay, we're in and the gift's on the gift pile (puts the present on the gift pile) and, um, oh (looks around), yes. (takes two rories from a passing tray and gives one to Luke) Cheers. Okay, there. Checking things off the list. We should probably move deeper into the house now."
"LUKE: What is this?"
"LORELAI: Do you see Rory?"
"LUKE: Not yet."
"LORELAI: Boy, big turnout."
"LUKE: Yeah. Maybe if we're lucky and we keep moving around, we can avoid..."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you came. You're here. There's a chocolate box for you in the hallway."
"LORELAI: Thank you, mom."
"EMILY: Hello, Luke. I didn't know you were coming. I don't have a chocolate box for you. You'll have to share with Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Fat chance. Mom buys really good chocolate."
"EMILY: I see you have a rory."
"LORELAI: Excuse me?"
"EMILY: Your drink. It's called a rory. What's the matter, Luke, you don't like your rory?"
"LUKE: Oh, no, It's-it's great. It's a little pink, you know."
"EMILY: Well, Rory's a girl. Girls like pink."
"LUKE: I know. I was just saying."
"EMILY: No one's asking you to wear it. It's not a skirt."
"LUKE: I know. I just..."
"LORELAI: Drink the drink. (Luke drinks)"
"EMILY: Well, nice of you two to come. I have some things to check on. We'll catch up later. Excuse me. (walks away)"
"LUKE: (disgusted) Ohh, it tasted pink."
"LORELAI: She's gone. (they start walking through the house)"
"LUKE: I mean, like, really tasted really pink, like pink pink. Yech!"
"LORELAI: Come on, let's get something to eat."
"LUKE: God, that's terrible. It's like drinking a ""My Little Pony"". (they walk off)"
"(CUT to Rory greeting some people. She spots Paris and Doyle and walks over to say ""hi"")"
"RORY: Hey, I'm glad you guys came."
"PARIS: We had to stop and eat first in case the food here sucked."
"DOYLE: Happy birthday, Rory."
"PARIS: Yeah, listen, we have really big news."
"RORY: Thanks Doyle. What Paris?"
"PARIS: You tell her."
"DOYLE: Okay."
"PARIS: But do it fast and don't embellish."
"DOYLE: As you know, I'm a senior, and my reign as editor of the Yale Daily News is officially up at the end of the year and I'm stepping down. I'm going back to writing full-time."
"RORY: Wow."
"DOYLE: I'm gonna be writing a column in the Daily News called ""The World According to Doyle""."
"RORY: I can't imagine The Daily News without you as editor."
"PARIS: Yeah. It's going to be weird. Ask who the new editor is."
"RORY: Oh! Who's the new editor going to be?"
"PARIS: Me."
"RORY: You? (a bit taken aback)"
"PARIS: That's right. Paris Geller is the new editor of the Yale Daily News. I was worried about the intimidation factor, 'cause people tend to be afraid of me, but I campaigned hard and really worked the ""my parents left me broke"" angle, got a little sympathy vote, and the next thing I know, I am the man."
"DOYLE: My woman is the man. (Rory looks around a bit uncomfortable)"
"PARIS: I mean, it's so incredible. Last year, I was sleeping with the editor."
"DOYLE: And this year, I am."
"PARIS: I can't wait. The changes I'm going to make."
"DOYLE: Hold on to your hats, people. (Rory notices as Lorelai and Luke walk up to the kids)"
"PARIS: I'm going to crack that whip, raise that bar. The last person that ran the shop was too busy ironing his petticoat to put out a decent paper."
"DOYLE: That's about to change."
"PARIS: You know it is."
"LORELAI: Hey, everyone. Hey, Paris."
"PARIS: Hey, Lorelai. You remember my boyfriend, Doyle?"
"LORELAI: Good to see you. This is Luke."
"PARIS: Nice to meet you, Luke."
"LUKE: We actually met about two or three weeks ago..."
"PARIS: This is my boyfriend, Doyle."
"DOYLE: It's nice to meet you."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too."
"LORELAI: Hey, birthday girl."
"RORY: Hey."
"PARIS: We were just talking about the big news."
"LORELAI: (excited) What's the big news?"
"PARIS: I'm the new editor of the Yale Daily News."
"LORELAI: (glances at Rory with a concerned look) Wow. Congratulations, Paris."
"PARIS: Yeah. Last year I was sleeping with the editor."
"DOYLE: And this year, I am."
"RORY: (still a bit uncomfortable) Um...I have to go say hello to some people, so I'll catch up with you guys later. Have some food. There's tons of food."
"PARIS: That doesn't mean I'm not gonna crack that whip on you too Doyle. (Rory leaves and Lorelai looks after her a bit worried)"
"(CUT to patio, later during the party. Luke and Lorelai are having some food)"
"LUKE: What's this?"
"LORELAI: You know they shouldn't be allowed to put just anything into a martini glass. Martinis should go into a martini glass. Gin martinis, vodka martinis, period. That's it."
"LUKE: Do you know what this is?"
"LORELAI: It's raw fish, Luke. Dip it in soy sauce and swallow it real quick. We were gonna drink martinis. The Rat Pack drank martinis. James Bond drank martinis. You know, it's the sweet drinks that really k*ll you. It's the sugar that give you the hangover and makes you throw up."
"LUKE: Yeah, 'cause no one's ever thrown up from a martini before. (puts the sushi in his mouth)"
"LORELAI: You seen my father?"
"LUKE: (chewing) Nope."
"LORELAI: Wonder where he's hiding."
"LUKE: Okay, I got the red piece down."
"LORELAI: ""Hello, 'page six'? Have I got a scoop for you"". (two DAR ladies walk up to them)"
"VIVIAN: Excuse me, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah?"
"VIVIAN: Hi, I'm Vivian Lewis, and this is Catherine Thurston Moore. We're friends of Rory's from the DAR."
"LORELAI: Oh, friends of Rory's. Wow. I didn't realize she ran with the bad girls. (the ladies laugh)"
"VIVIAN: We just wanted to tell you we love Rory."
"CATHERINE: She introduced us to buffalo wings and jalapeno poppers, and for that we will be eternally grateful."
"LUKE: What's the DAR? (the ladies laugh again, Luke looks at Lorelai quizzically, and she smiles) I'm gonna get a beer. Anyone want anything?"
"LORELAI: I'm good."
"LUKE: Okay, I'll be back. (as he walks off inside the camera pans on Paris and Doyle saying their story...again)"
"PARIS: Last year I was sleeping with the editor."
"DOYLE: (after a long pause) Now I am. (their companions laugh)"
"PARIS: Come in a little quicker next time."
"(CUT to inside. Rory is with a group of ladies, but notices Luke and walks up to him)"
"RORY: (at ladies) Oh, excuse me. (at Luke) Hey, little tip: We have beer here."
"LUKE: Oh, the magic words. I was just heading over to the bar."
"RORY: Have you tried a rory yet?"
"LUKE: Yes, I have. Not my kind of drink."
"RORY: Yeah, mine, either."
"LUKE: Lorelai will be glad to hear it. So, you two haven't talked yet."
"RORY: Nope, not yet."
"LUKE: Well, it was nice of you to invite her here. It means a lot."
"RORY: I'm glad she came. I'm glad you both came."
"LUKE: Oh, uh, here. I've got something for you. (looks in his pockets, takes out a jewellery gift box and hands it over to her) Birthday present."
"RORY: Really?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I brought it just in case your mother didn't bring one, but she did. It's the one on top of your present mountain over there. But since I already had it in my pocket, I just figured...(Rory opens it and looks at it touched)"
"RORY: Luke."
"LUKE: It was my mother's. Liz can't wear it 'cause her neck's too fat, but your neck looks, you know, not fat. It was sitting around in my drawer, so I thought, ""hey, give it to Rory"". You know you're lucky 'cause Caesar's birthday is next month and I know he likes pearls, so..."
"RORY: (chuckles a bit) Thank you."
"LUKE: You're welcome. (they hug. A lady - Tweeny - from the group Rory was previously talking to walks over to them)"
"TWEENY: I saw a jewellery box and I couldn't help myself. What did you get? (Rory shows off her gift) Oh, it's fantastic."
"RORY: It's from Luke, my stepfather-to-be. (Luke is pleasantly taken aback)"
"TWEENY: Well, you have exquisite taste, Luke. I'm Tweeny Halpern."
"RORY: Tweeny works with me at the DAR."
"LUKE: What's the DAR? (Tweeny laughs) I'm k*ll with that line tonight."
"(CUT to patio outside. Emily walks up to Lorelai)"
"EMILY: Well, how's the party going so far?"
"LORELAI: Seems to be a big hit."
"EMILY: Where's Luke? I hope he didn't get lost somewhere."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I'm sure he's just sizing up how much silver he can stuff into his pockets without it making too much of a bulge."
"EMILY: I was not insinuating that he was a thief."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"EMILY: I was just making small, polite talk. That's what you do at parties. My commenting on his getting lost was in no way a swipe."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, I forgot. Luke went to get a beer. Take it. (Emily notices Lorelai's ring) Come on, Mom, it's all about timing. You know that. What are you...(realises what Emily is looking at)"
"EMILY: well, it seems congratulations are in order."
"LORELAI: Well, that wasn't exactly congratulations, but, sure, close enough. (Claire comes to Emily)"
"CLAIRE: Excuse me, Mrs.Gilmore, but we really should cut the cake now."
"EMILY: Have you seen Mr.Gilmore yet?"
"CLAIRE: No, I haven't."
"EMILY: Of course not. He's going to sit all night long in that office of his, moping and sulking, missing his granddaughter's birthday party, and he's going to leave me out here all alone to host it. Fine. Come on, Claire. (Emily and Claire walk off, and Lorelai looks with concern towards the house and starts to make her way inside)"
"(CUT to Richard's study. There is a knock on the door and Lorelai enters. Richard is sitting in one of the armchairs drinking scotch and sulking)"
"LORELAI: Hello? Dad? You're missing a crazy party out there. You know someone forgot to cook the fish? Boy, is Mom gonna be mad."
"RICHARD: Go away, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What's wrong, Dad?"
"RICHARD: You know what's wrong. Rory's wrong. It's all wrong. She's not going back to Yale. It's my fault. (Lorelai sits opposite him)"
"LORELAI: Rory made a choice, Dad."
"RICHARD: I could've stopped her, and I didn't. I cleared the path for her to walk away from her goal, her life."
"LORELAI: Dad..."
"RICHARD: She's having sex, Lorelai. She's having sex under my roof. I paid 40,000 dollars to redecorate her sex house. I bought her her sex mattress, her sex box springs. I provided everything she needs to waste her life."
"LORELAI: Dad, Rory having sex is not your fault, really. She was having sex way before the big renovation."
"RICHARD: I feel so much better now."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. I-I wasn't trying to..."
"RICHARD: I made a terrible, terrible mistake."
"LORELAI: No, Dad, listen...(Emily walks in rather upset)"
"EMILY: Richard, you come out of here right now and make an appearance at this party."
"RICHARD: I don't give a damn about the party, Emily."
"EMILY: What is going on with you? You've been holed up in here for two days. Is it work?"
"LORELAI: It's Rory."
"EMILY: What about Rory?"
"RICHARD: What do you mean, ""What about Rory""? We've lost her."
"EMILY: What are you talking about? I got her out of the pool house."
"RICHARD: For a day. For two days, and then those rentals go back."
"EMILY: Fine, then I'll have the place fumigated. That'll take a week. Then I'll have the place checked for mold. That'll be two weeks. Then I'll find rats. Then there will be carbon monoxide leaks, and pluming issues and if I have to, I'll tear the damn place down. In the meantime, she's here where we can watch her."
"RICHARD: That doesn't matter, Emily. We have lost her."
"EMILY: No!"
"RICHARD: We've failed."
"EMILY: No! We have not failed. We have not failed until that girl comes home pregnant. Then we've failed!"
"LORELAI: And on that note...(Lorelai gets up and walks out of the study)"
"EMILY: Richard, I don't understand what's happening. Everything's been fine except the sex issue."
"RICHARD: Everything hasn't been fine. (frustrated gets up and starts pacing) The minute we went against Lorelai, we lost."
"EMILY: You're acting like this is my fault. Going against Lorelai was your idea. I was perfectly ready to go ahead with the plan that the three of us devised."
"RICHARD: Running around with Logan, joining the DAR, planning parties."
"EMILY: What's wrong with joining the DAR? We both agreed she needed a job."
"RICHARD: Fund-raisers and tea parties? It's frivolous and meaningless. She has more to do, more to be. I don't want that life for her."
"EMILY: (with an upset and a insulted look) You mean my life. You don't want her to be me."
"RICHARD: Emily, no. That's not what I meant."
"EMILY: We're cutting the cake now. Can't wait anymore. (Emily walks out clearly upset, and Richard is left alone also upset)"
"(CUT to living room. Lorelai walks around and spots Rory. They wave at each other and meet up half way across the room)"
"LORELAI: So."
"RORY: So."
"LORELAI: Your drink is disgusting."
"RORY: Tell me about it."
"LORELAI: Nice party, though."
"RORY: Yeah, it's very nice."
"LORELAI: You look great."
"RORY: You look skinny."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it's the construction diet."
"RORY: Construction?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, we're making the bedroom bigger."
"RORY: You and Luke?"
"LORELAI: No, me and John O'Hurley. Luke doesn't know yet. I hope he takes it okay."
"RORY: You guys are gonna live at our house?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Wow. That's nice."
"So, what's new with you?"
"RORY: Oh, well, not much. I got my community service hours down from 300 to 104, so..."
"LORELAI: God, community should be well-served by now. They should build a statue of you when you're done."
"RORY: Well, it's not just one community."
"LORELAI: Right, yeah. That makes more sense, I guess. I got a dog."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Stop. He's fine."
"RORY: He's alive?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he's alive, and I'm not discussing that hamster again."
"RORY: But you asked Babette to double-check that you feed it in the morning?"
"LORELAI: That is so not necessary...and yes."
"RORY: Wow, a dog. A lot has changed."
"LORELAI: A lot, and then not so much, also."
"RORY: Did you get your chocolate box? They're by the door."
"LORELAI: No, I didn't. I'll get one on the way out."
"RORY: They're good. I ate two."
"LORELAI: It's a really pretty party. I actually like all the votives and the...(Lorelai is cut off by the ""happy birthday song"". Lane and Logan come to take Rory closer to the cake. Lorelai is left behind. As everyone is singing Happy Birthday Lorelai watches on sadly. As the song ends Luke walks up to her at looks ate her with concern)"
"LORELAI: Ready to go?"
"LUKE: Sure. (they starts to leave)"
"(CUT to Luke's car, night. Luke and Lorelai are driving back in silence)"
"LUKE: Hey. You can pull link sausages out of me if you want. (Lorelai turns to look at him and smiles)"

"(OPEN in Lorelai's house, night. The house looks like it's prepped to be painted. Lorelai is sitting on an armchair looking at some paint samples with Paul Anka near by, and Luke pacing around)"
"LORELAI: Your impatience is very distracting."
"LUKE: I said nothing."
"LORELAI: I'm getting a vibe."
"LUKE: I can't control my vibe."
"LORELAI: Maybe I should do this alone."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: But I need to collect my thoughts."
"LUKE: The last time I left you alone with your thoughts, I came back and you were in the reds again."
"LORELAI: So?"
"LUKE: We've ruled out red."
"LORELAI: Why did we rule out red?"
"LUKE: Because you don't like red."
"LORELAI: Right. And when I'm right, I'm right. Red would be way too much in here. Now, just give me a minute to concentrate. Cone of silence, please."
"LUKE: You got it. (notices Lorelai's shoes lined on the floor) Hey, what are all your shoes doing down here?"
"LORELAI: You broke the cone."
"LUKE: Yeah. They're gonna get ruined. (he starts picking them up)"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, talk to Paul Anka. He's one by one marched every pair of my shoes downstairs, and I have no idea why. Lined them up perfectly, too. Left, right, left, right. He's very a**l when he misbehaves."
"LUKE: Yeah. I'll clear them out."
"LORELAI: No, no, no. Don't. I want him to march them back up himself. How else will he learn?"
"LUKE: Fine. (drops the shoes) Whatever. (pointing at Paul Anka) Weirdo. (sits on the bed opposite Lorelai)"
"LORELAI: Why did I say I don't like red?"
"LUKE: I think your exact words were, ""better dead than red""."
"LORELAI: 'Cause I'm liking red now."
"LUKE: What happened to the white you picked? That was such a nice white, and you were so sure about it."
"LORELAI: It didn't go with Paul Anka."
"LUKE: Unbelievable."
"LORELAI: Look. (holds up the paint sample to Paul Anka)"
"LUKE: Oh, yeah. You're right. That does not work, not at all."
"LORELAI: See?"
"LUKE: I was kidding."
"LORELAI: You know, your kidding is really slowing down the process here, big-time. Hey, uh, what about a...blue?"
"LUKE: We're painting the outside blue."
"LORELAI: Or maybe a yellow."
"LUKE: Oh, come on now. Yellow really doesn't go with Paul Anka."
"LORELAI: You know, if nothing goes with him, we may have to move."
"LUKE: Do you want to know the problem here?"
"LORELAI: Actually, no. I don't like problems. I avoid them when I can, and I don't like people pointing them out to me."
"LUKE: The guys are almost done prepping the walls, and then they're gonna want to paint. If we don't have a colour for them, they're gonna have nothing to do, and then they're gonna bolt, and we won't see them again for weeks."
"LORELAI: That is so cold."
"LUKE: Well they go where the money is. If they're not painting, they're not earning."
"LORELAI: Oh, wait. Paul Anka. Maybe he has an opinion on all this."
"LUKE: Oh, I'm sure he does."
"LORELAI: Okay, dude. Check them out. Don't overthink it. What looks good to you? (holds up the paint samples for him and he licks a one) Ooh! He licked the dark magenta."
"LUKE: You know dogs are colour-blind."
"LORELAI: Okay, technicality. What about the baseboards? Baseboards. (he licks again) Ooh! Dark magenta baseboards. Interesting choice."
"LUKE: I need a beer. (gets up and makes his way to the kitchen)"
"LORELAI: Oh. Oh, get one for me, too, please. (at Paul Anka) How about the ceiling? (the dog licks again and Lorelai gasps) Dark magenta! You've got the q*eer eye, my friend. (pets Paul Anka) Oh yeah!"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"(CUT to Rory's bedroom at the mansion, morning. Rory is asleep. There is a knock on the door and Rory wakes up startled)"
"EMILY (from outside the door): Rise and shine!"
"RORY: No, no, no, no, no."
"EMILY (from outside the door): It's a beautiful morning."
"RORY: No rising. No shining."
"EMILY (from outside the door): Don't let it go to waste. I'll be back in five if I don't see you."
"RORY: (angry and frustrated) No, no more ""back in five""! (lies back down)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Lorelai and Luke walk in the diner coming from upstairs in mid-conversation)"
"LORELAI: It's perfect. A light, slightly washed-out green like you see in renaissance wall paintings, with the baseboards painted an aquamarine blue, but dulled so it's got a little Latin touch. And you paint the ceilings off-white with a hint of yellow to go great with the floors and just give the whole space a nice glow. (Lorelai sits on a stool at the counter as Luke stays behind the counter) What do you think?"
"LUKE: We're not painting my apartment."
"LORELAI: (chuckles) Why not?"
"LUKE: Because we're painting your house. That's why you have the colour samples."
"LORELAI: Mm-hm, and there's not enough paint to paint your place and the other place?"
"LUKE: There's not enough time. As you work on the perfect colours for my house and Babette's house and Mr.Lanahan's house and Sookie's house..."
"LORELAI: Oh, I showed Sookie that blanched almond. She flipped."
"LUKE: ...And the post office and the church and the odd fellows hall, the painters are getting closer and closer to being ready to paint your house. You gotta focus or..."
"LORELAI: Or what?"
"LUKE: I'm gonna take that away. (indicating at the paint-sample thingy)"
"LORELAI: Oh, no! You would not take my paint-sample thingy away from me."
"LUKE: I most certainly would."
"LORELAI: Well, that would seriously slow down the process. And I don't know if you know this, but if the painters have nothing to do, they'll move on to another job. (a townie - Maggie - and two little girls - Tilly and Megan - walk up to Luke and Lorelai)"
"LUKE: It's ""the twilight zone"". I do not know what to do here. (Lorelai notices they have company)"
"LORELAI: Hey. I think the lullaby league is looking for you."
"LUKE: (at the girls) Oh. Yeah?"
"MEGAN: Mr.Danes, I'm Megan, and this is Tilly."
"TILLY: Hi."
"MEGAN: Um, we go to Stars Hollow Middle School. You went there. (Luke stares at the girls)"
"LORELAI: I think they're looking for confirmation."
"LUKE: Yeah, I went."
"MAGGIE: He's busy, girls. Don't keep him long."
"MEGAN: Well, we're on a soccer team, and we lost our sponsor."
"LORELAI: Aw, who was your sponsor?"
"MEGAN: Luger's bait and tackle."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's right. They're shutting down. (at Luke) Luger's wife caught him at that motel with the transv...(remembers that there are kids around) sistor radio, and, uh, he retired honourably."
"LUKE: So, what are you here for?"
"MEGAN: We were wondering if you would sponsor our team."
"LUKE: Well, I don't know..."
"TILLY: You just have to buy our jerseys."
"MEGAN: It'll say ""Luke's Diner"" on the back."
"TILLY: Plus our name: ""The bobcats"". And you pitch in for trophies if we win."
"MEGAN: But you don't even have to go to the games if you don't want."
"TILLY: Yeah. You don't have to come."
"LUKE: Girls, no offence, but I don't think so. It's not my thing."
"MAGGIE: No problem. Thank him for his time, girls. (the girls look a bit sad)"
"MEGAN: Thank you."
"TILLY: Thank you, Mr.Danes."
"LUKE: You're welcome."
"LORELAI: Bye. (the girls and Maggie go back to their table) Wow, Oliver Twist just kindly asked for a little more gruel, and you kicked him right in the junk."
"LUKE: Who?"
"LORELAI: You broke those darling little girls' hearts."
"LUKE: They'll find someone else."
"LORELAI: How is this not your thing?"
"LUKE: I don't want to coach a soccer team."
"LORELAI: They don't need a coach. How closely were you listening?"
"LUKE: Well, not that closely. Kids usually talk, but they don't say anything. You know, they just kind of yammer, so if you don't find them cute, they're just boring."
"LORELAI: God, you should really have your own children's show, you know, as an alternative to the nice ones."
"LUKE: You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: It's just a sponsorship, and they're from your alma mater, which, by the way, is looking drab and could use a touch-up. I'd recommend the light salmon. Doesn't that mean something?"
"LUKE: I guess a little."
"LORELAI: You don't even have to go to the games, and you'd get to have your name on the back of the jerseys. Free advertising, how cool is that?"
"LUKE: Well, yeah, that might be all right."
"LORELAI: Hey, and you'll get that photo that sponsors get of the whole team sitting on the field, and you can display it like Al's Pancake World does. Ooh, Al...that sea-green with burnt-sienna trim."
"LUKE: (grabs the sample thingy away from her) I warned you."
"LORELAI: OH! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Come on. Give it back, please. I'm jonesing. I need my colours. Please. (he gives it back)"
"LUKE: Think they're any good?"
"LORELAI: I don't know if that matters."
"(Luke walks up to the girls and Maggie's table)"
"LUKE: Hey, uh, if you still want a sponsor, we can give it a sh*t."
"MEGAN: Really?!"
"TILLY: Yay! (the girls get up and hug Luke)"
"MAGGIE: Oh, that's wonderful, Luke. Thank you."
"LUKE: (a bit uncomfortable) I guess this is you being grateful."
"LORELAI: (pointing at a blue shade from the sample thingy) For the jerseys."
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, morning. Rory is coming down the stairs talking on her cell phone at Logan. The scene CUTS between Rory at the mansion and Logan at Yale)"
"RORY: You really get, like, no notice on these things, do you?"
"LOGAN: None. It's a ""grab your bag and meet me at the tarmac, son, over and out"", and it's always at an ungodly hour."
"RORY: 6:00 am?"
"LOGAN: That's my bedtime, for God's sake."
"RORY: So. where's he dragging you this time?"
"LOGAN: A paper in Omaha. What state is that in again?"
"RORY: Nebraska."
"LOGAN: Ah. Corn, farm animals, football."
"RORY: Oh, and they love condescension in Nebraska, too, so hit them with that as soon as you disembark."
"LOGAN: Well, you have got to be free tonight, my dear, 'cause I'm getting the group together for a blow-out. Do not tell me you're working."
"RORY: I can make some time for you. (notices Emily sitting in the room she was about to enter, turns the other way and start almost whispering) Oops. Evasive manoeuvre."
"LOGAN: What?"
"RORY: My grandmother."
"LOGAN: Is she coming at you with a knife or something?"
"RORY: It's one thing to be forced to move into the big house, but now the big house is feeling Tom thumb tiny. My grandmother's everywhere."
"LOGAN: The older generation...They have their methods of ubiquity."
"RORY: I'm positive that there are at least five of her wandering the property like she's a Cylon."
"LOGAN: (whispering) So, can you meet me out here tonight?"
"RORY: Why are you whispering?"
"LOGAN: Because you're whispering."
"RORY: That's cute. I'll see you at your place? eight o'clock?"
"LOGAN: Perfect."
"RORY: See you then. (hangs up the phone and is about to exit the house, but Emily comes in the room just in time and startles her)"
"EMILY: Rory!"
"RORY: Oh, hi, Grandma. I was just heading out, in kind of a hurry. (does not"
"turn around to look at Emily)"
"EMILY: Heading out where?"
"RORY: Errands. Just errands."
"EMILY: You know, Shandinka would be willing to do your errands for you. She has a used SUV."
"RORY: I can do them myself."
"EMILY: Is something wrong with your face?"
"RORY: No."
"EMILY: Why are you hiding it? (Rory turns around to face Emily) It looks fine."
"RORY: It is fine."
"EMILY: So, are you staying overnight at Paris' again this week?"
"RORY: Maybe."
"EMILY: That's so fun. Having a girlfriend for sleepovers. You know, Paris can sleep over here sometime if you want."
"RORY: Great. Thanks."
"EMILY: Your Grandfather's out of town for a few days, so it's just us girls. Got a preference for dinner tonight?"
"RORY: I may not make it for dinner tonight, Grandma."
"EMILY: Oh. I was looking forward to it."
"RORY: Sorry."
"EMILY: It's always good to give 24-hours notice on these things."
"RORY: Again, sorry."
"EMILY: You're looking skinnier, and you're skipping dinner."
"RORY: I'm not skipping dinner. I'm having dinner out."
"EMILY: You're not bulimic?"
"RORY: I really have to go, Grandma."
"EMILY: One last thing. The Russian tea for the DAR...That's going well?"
"RORY: Yeah. It's like clockwork. It's an easy one. Teas are easy."
"EMILY: Oh! That reminds me. (goes off to the other room)"
"RORY: I really have to go, Grandma (quietly to herself) she said for the umpteenth time. (Emily comes back in, holding a dress)"
"EMILY: What do you think?"
"RORY: It's nice. Whose is it?"
"EMILY: It's for you, for the Russian tea. Want to try it on?"
"RORY: Later. Please. I really, really have to go."
"EMILY: Well, that's something to look forward to."
"RORY: Definitely."
"EMILY: See you later."
"RORY: See you later. (Rory exits. Outside of the house now, she takes a calming breath and walks off)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, night. Babette and Lorelai are in the living room. Babette is sitting on the armchair, looking through the sample thingy and Lorelai is hovering over her)"
"BABETTE: Oh, this is hard. This is so hard."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know."
"BABETTE: I can be so indecisive. Put me in front of a bin of cantaloupe, it'll take me an hour to pick one. An hour! And this is harder than cantaloupe."
"LORELAI: Come on. Focus, Babette. A green, an off-white. what do you think?"
"BABETTE: They all seem fine."
"LORELAI: See, I don't know if you're aware of this, but if painters are ready to paint, and you don't have your colours ready, they'll leave, and you'll never see them again, so the clock is ticking here."
"LUKE (OS): Don't let her bully you, Babette."
"BABETTE: But I gotta pick a colour!"
"LUKE (OS): Lorelai's gotta pick a colour!"
"LORELAI: Just leave us alone out here! Go about your business! (sits on the bed close to Babette)"
"LUKE (OS): You're being cruel to Babette, and you're going to rot in hell for this."
"LORELAI: I'm just getting her opinion."
"BABETTE: I've caused an argument. I'm horrible."
"LUKE (OS): You've got till close of day tomorrow, and that's it."
"BABETTE: Good! That'll give me enough time!"
"LUKE (OS): Not you, Babette, Lorelai!"
"BABETTE: Oh, he's mad at me."
"LORELAI: He's not mad at you. And he's right. It's my thing. I should do it."
"BABETTE: Thank God. Well, here's the information you wanted for Paul Anka. You got your training schools. Training's always good for them."
"LORELAI: Yeah, uh, I took him to a few sessions. He fell in love with a poodle and got very distracted."
"BABETTE: And doggy day care. Let him run around with other dogs. Good for socializing him."
"LORELAI: Well, the other dogs we've come across on walks, he'll bark at them, and then when they turn and look at him, he'll play dead. It's kind of sad."
"BABETTE: Well, he's the cutest basket case I've ever seen. That's for sure. Gotta go. (they stand up)"
"LORELAI: Okay. Thanks for coming, Babette. This will help. So... (talking very quietly) hey, if you were gonna pick between the papaya whip I showed you and the medium spring green..."
"LUKE (OS): STOP IT!"
"LORELAI: God, he's got good ears."
"BABETTE: See you, doll. Good luck!"
"LORELAI: Thanks. Bye."
"BABETTE: Bye! (they walk towards the door)"
"(CUT to kitchen, continuous. Luke is sitting at the table talking on the phone, and looking at a catalogue. Lorelai comes in and sits with him)"
"LUKE: Yeah, I want the two-colour team name on the front in script and the ""Luke's Diner"" in a vertical arch above the number on the back."
"LORELAI: ""L"" for Lorelai."
"LUKE: ""L"" for Luke's."
"LORELAI: Hey, our names have the same first letter."
"LUKE: You like the style?"
"LORELAI: Classy."
"LUKE: (on the phone) But I want really nice stitching, even if it costs extra. I don't care that it's double. Just do it. I want my girls to look good."
"LORELAI: Listen to Daddy Warbucks."
"LUKE: Yeah. 12 for the team plus three spares will do it. 15 in all. (Lorelai get his attention and point at herself - she wants a jersey) Uh, plus another medium, 16, (Lorelai points at Luke) and an extra-large men's, so 17. (Paul Anka comes on the kitchen, starts to scratch Rory's bedroom door and is whimpering. Lorelai points at him too) And one for a medium dog. Yeah. Dog. And this is a rush order. I want them for the next game. Okay, thanks, Ollie. Bye. (hangs up)"
"LORELAI: Those girls are gonna be styling."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, they're gonna have the best uniforms in the league. I've seen pictures of the other teams. Little bag ladies."
"LORELAI: Look how you've embraced this."
"LUKE: Well, the more I thought about it, the more fun it seemed, you know. And my friend Ed told me the team is actually pretty good. They got a chance to go all the way."
"LORELAI: Cool. Wow. They could make a movie about this someday. You know...The reluctant, handsome diner owner sponsoring a team that goes all the way to the national finals, and you know who would play you?"
"LUKE: Who?"
"LORELAI: Tobey Maguire!"
"LUKE: He's way younger than me."
"LORELAI: But his career is hot. Go with Tobey."
"LUKE: What about that Vito Morgenstern?"
"LORELAI: Sure. Or Viggo Mortensen."
"LUKE: Oh."
"LORELAI: Or Donald Sutherland."
"LUKE: Too old."
"LORELAI: We'll dye his hair."
"LUKE: He's got jowls."
"LORELAI: You're picky. (Paul Anka whimpers again and keeps on scraching Rory's door)"
"LUKE: What's he doing?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. He's been doing that a lot lately. Hey, hey, buddy, there's nothing for you there. (he lies down) He need geritol? He's been lethargic lately. He's depressed or something. (Luke takes the phone again and starts dialling) Who are you calling?"
"LUKE: Just saw something in this thing. (on phone) Hey, Ollie, it's Luke Danes again. Listen, I was looking through your brochure again. You can make caps, too, right?"
"LORELAI: Soccer players wear caps?"
"LUKE: (at Lorelai) No, I just think they'll look cute in them. (on phone) Yeah, what's your highest quality cap you got there? Yeah, I don't want plastic in the sizing. It's cheapo. You got that kind that you kind of pull on the cloth thingy to size it, right? (Lorelai gets up and bends over Paul Anka to pet him) Great. Well, give me 20 of those."
"(CUT to Rich Man's Shoe, night. A folk singer is on the stage singing. Rory, Logan, Finn, Colin, Rosemary and Juliet are sitting at a table. The boys seem rather drunk. Finn and Colin perk up when the folk singer, who is a girl, sings ""met her"")"
"FINN: ""Met her""."
"COLIN: Cool. A girl-on-girl thing. (the song goes ""there I took her life"") It's a snuff film."
"FINN: A lesbian snuff film. (she repeats the last couple of verses)"
"COLIN: A redundant lesbian snuff film. How INXS missed her, I don't know."
"LOGAN: Raise a glass to INXS."
"FINN: My countrymen, I'm less than proud to say."
"COLIN: I cannot, cannot believe they've reinstated folk night at my beloved pub."
"FINN: It's a travesty!"
"JULIET: Is there any alcohol left in the state of Connecticut that's not inside them?"
"ROSEMARY: I doubt it."
"LOGAN: So, boys, another round?"
"COLIN: Posthaste. Barkeep!"
"RORY: You've hardly touched the drink in front of you."
"LOGAN: Ah, but I'm anticipating. You don't wait till the drink's done to order another. That's for amateurs."
"RORY: Right. I forgot you went pro."
"LOGAN: So, boys, boys, when is the Life & Death Brigade going out again? We have been remiss."
"COLIN: I have ideas. Big ideas. Potentially harmful ideas. (another customer from a near by table turns at them)"
"CUSTOMER: Hey, you mind?"
"COLIN: Boyfriend?"
"FINN: Brother."
"COLIN: Or both. He could be southern."
"LOGAN: Hey. New drinking game. Every time the folk singer sounds sincere, we have to take a drink."
"JULIET: Buckle up. It's gonna be a long night."
"FINN: Come on. Start folding your own, gents. (he folds up a piece of napkin and throws it towards the stage) Whoever hits the folk singer first wins. (Colin follows his lead)"
"(CUT to outside Rich Man's Shoe, night much later on. The gang comes out of the bar. The boys are totally wasted. Rory is supporting Logan because he's too drunk and tries to lead him and get Colin and Finn in her car. The girls stay back)"
"FINN: Good morning, New Haven! My, my, you look fresh and appealing tonight!"
"MAN (OS): Shut up!"
"FINN: God has spoken to me... rather rudely."
"MAN (OS): Shut up!"
"RORY: Finn, keep it down."
"COLIN: (climbs on car and hold on to a street light pole) Finn, watch. Tostingo! (throws a glass he was holding in the air, Finn pretends to be sh**ting at it and it shatters)"
"MAN (OS): Hey...Shut up!"
"LOGAN: Why are we leaving, Ace?"
"RORY: Because they're closing."
"LOGAN: That's no excuse."
"RORY: We've overstayed our welcome."
"LOGAN: That makes me sad."
"RORY: You've gotta get your plane in the morning."
"JULIET: Have I gained weight?"
"ROSEMARY: Why?"
"JULIET: Finn didn't make a pass at me."
"FINN: No, love, my brain is cloudy. Here I am making a pass at you. Pass, pass!"
"COLIN: That is so expositional."
"RORY: Guys, just get in the car. (the boys look in through the open car door but don't move)"
"COLIN: I've forgotten how to get into a car."
"FINN: Me too. Rory, did you have your owner's manual with you, love?"
"RORY: Oh, my god. Just get in! (starts pushing them in)"
"JULIET: Bon voyage."
"ROSEMARY: Good luck with your ringling. (the girls walk off)"
"LOGAN: One more drink. (he stalks off back to the bar. One of the workers is closing the gate)"
"COLIN: Oh, we've got a runner!"
"LOGAN: Come on (Rory runs after Logan)"
"RORY: Logan!"
"LOGAN: Hey, come on. Let me in. (steadying himself on the pub's gate)"
"RORY: Oh, Logan, they're closed."
"LOGAN: I have to apologize to that folk singer."
"RORY: She's not here. Everyone's gone."
"LOGAN: I hurt her feelings."
"RORY: She's a folk singer. She's used to it. Come on. (she grabs him and starts walking him back to the car)"
"LOGAN: I don't want to go to Omaha tomorrow."
"RORY: I know."
"LOGAN: It's boring."
"RORY: I know."
"LOGAN: And it's not here."
"RORY: Come on. Yeah."
"LOGAN: I don't like steaks or insurance or football or anything else that they have there."
"RORY: You like steaks."
"LOGAN: Do they even have electricity there?"
"RORY: Yeah. Yeah. They just got it last year."
"LOGAN: Don't make me go."
"RORY: I'm not making you go. I'm just trying to get you home."
"LOGAN: But getting me home means that I have to go to sleep, and when I wake up, I have to go on a plane to Omaha. (they finally reach the car and Rory tries to help Logan in) Where's Omaha? Where's Omaha?"
"RORY: Oh. Just get in, please."
"LOGAN: (as he sits gets in) Aah! Ahh! (Rory looks around for Colin and Finn. They are gone)"
"RORY: Colin? Finn?"
"MAN (OS): Shut up!"
"RORY: Guys!"
"MAN (OS): Shut up!"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion driveway, night. Rory drives up and gets out of her car. Someone walks up to the gate and Rory turns to see who it is)"
"RORY: Jess. (he opens the gate and help himself in)"
"JESS: Hey."
"RORY: Hey."
"(they stare at each other)"
"RORY: I...sorry. That wasn't a sentence."
"JESS: I got the gist. (he walks up to her)"
"RORY: What are you doing here?"
"JESS: I got a job. Professional driveway stalker."
"RORY: Pays good?"
"JESS: Yeah, but the hours suck."
"RORY: Jess...?"
"JESS: I'm in town on a little business. All nice and aboveboard."
"RORY: How'd you know where to find me?"
"JESS: Luke. I shook it out of him. He wasn't sure if it was okay."
"RORY: It's okay. You look good. The years don't seem to have hardened you."
"JESS: Yeah, you look good, too. I know this is kind of weird, but there's actually something I wanted to tell you. Show you, actually. (Rory looks up at the house, Jess notices) I can come back another time."
"RORY: No, it's just, uh, we're kind of exposed here. My...her window's, like, right there."
"JESS: Whose?"
"RORY: Uh, my Grandma's. You want to come in?"
"JESS: You sure?"
"RORY: Yeah. Come on. But just be careful. She's a very light sleeper. (they start walking towards the house)"
"(CUT to Rory's room, continuous. They enter)"
"RORY: So, here we are."
"JESS: Casa Rory. (Rory closes the door, takes a pillow from the bed and puts it on the foot of the door. Jess looks on)"
"RORY: So our voices don't carry."
"JESS: Very prudent."
"RORY: This is not really my taste."
"JESS: Yeah, not unless you've aged about 90 years."
"RORY: I haven't."
"JESS: Is that for Halloween? (pointing at the dress Emily was showing Rory earlier)"
"RORY: No, no. This is just for a function I have to go to."
"JESS: Function?"
"RORY: It's just a job. The DAR. Daughters of the American Revolution. It's not a career or anything."
"JESS: I hope not."
"RORY: No. See, don't get the wrong idea. I'm just here temporarily. My mom and I..."
"JESS: Luke alluded to something."
"RORY: It's a long story. I was crashing in the pool house, and that was just temporary, but the pool house became storage, so then I had to move into the main house. All temporary."
"JESS: Isn't school in session?"
"RORY: Mm-hmm."
"JESS: Why aren't you living on campus?"
"RORY: Because I'm not going."
"JESS: You graduate already, Doogie?"
"RORY: No. I'm just taking a little time off."
"JESS: Time off."
"RORY: So, where are you living, Jess? I want to know about you, mystery man."
"(they sit)"
"JESS: I'm in Philly."
"RORY: Really?"
"JESS: Don't laugh."
"RORY: No, I'm not. Philadelphia's gotten cool."
"JESS: And New York's gotten expensive. Anyway, it's a pretty cool scene in Philly now. Lot of younger people there...pretty big art scene."
"RORY: I know. I read that in the New York Times. They had a picture of a bunch of young people standing on a roof, kind of eclectic and all. It looked fun. I mean, it was clearly one of those pictures that wasn't candid. It was looking a little stiff, but they looked happy."
"JESS: Are you nervous?"
"RORY: A little. It's been a long time."
"JESS: I'm a little nervous, too."
"RORY: Good. I'm not alone."
"JESS: So, I didn't just come here to chat. I wanted to show you something. (takes hios bag and starts looking for something)"
"RORY: Right. You said that."
"JESS: Yeah, and I didn't think you'd believe it if I didn't show it to you in person. (takes out a book and give it to her)"
"RORY: Well, colour me curious. A book. (reading the cover) ""'The Subsect'...written by Jess Mariano."""
"JESS: It's no misprint."
"RORY: You wrote a book?"
"JESS: A short novel."
"RORY: You wrote a book?!"
"JESS: And through a fluke, I got it to these guys that have a small press, and they read it. I don't know if they were high or something, but they decided to publish it."
"RORY: You wrote a book."
"JESS: There's no money in it. They only printed like 500 of them. Believe me, I'm not quitting my day job."
"RORY: But you wrote it. You wrote a book. (gets up and starts pacing around flipping the pages a bit)"
"JESS: Yeah, I know. It's hard to believe."
"RORY: You sat down and wrote a novel."
"JESS: Author-distributed, too. That's what I'm doing here. I'm going around begging independent bookstores to put it in stock. Got it in a few."
"RORY: Cool! Where?"
"JESS: Around."
"RORY: I want to see it in a store."
"JESS: I can give you the addresses."
"RORY: You know what I'm gonna do when I see it in the store?"
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: You know that section toward the front, the staff recommendations? I'm gonna grab a copy of your book and put it in that section, and then I'm going to write my own little recommendation on a card and attach it so people see it and buy it."
"JESS: Read it first. That way you can discourage people from buying it."
"RORY: No way! I know it's good. (she sits again) Jess, you've got such a great brain. I knew that if you could just sit down and stop shaking it around, you could do something like this. I knew it. I knew it."
"JESS: I know you did. I work at that press now. Five smelly guys in a cramped room on Locust Street putting out about three books a month. But it's fun."
"RORY: What about a sequel? Are you writing a sequel?"
"JESS: You should read it before you get too jazzed about it, okay?"
"RORY: Shh! (they are quiet for a few seconds and Rory looks alert. After a bit she sighs) Sorry. I thought I heard footsteps. I think we're okay."
"JESS: It's kind of late. I should go."
"RORY: It is kind of late. (they both get up and start moving to the door)"
"JESS: So, I just basically wanted to show you that. Uh, tell you... tell you that I couldn't have done it without you."
"RORY: Thanks."
"JESS: I'm gonna be around for a couple days. Can we talk again? Preferably above a whisper."
"RORY: Yeah. I'd like that. How about tomorrow night?"
"JESS: Eight okay?"
"RORY: Yep."
"JESS: Good. I'll sneak out on my own."
"RORY: Cool. (they get to the door. Jess picks up the pillow and gives it to Rory. She sees the book in her hand) Oh, hey. The book."
"JESS: Oh, it's yours. (he leaves and closes the door. Rory sits on her bed and starts going through the book a bit)"

"(CUT to soccer field, morning. Two teams - one of them is The Bobcats - are warming up. There are a bunch of soccer parents on the side lines. Luke and Lorelai make their way through, wearing their matching Bobcat jerseys)"
"LORELAI: So, where are the bleachers?"
"LUKE: Oh, they don't have bleachers at soccer games. They just stand on the sidelines."
"LORELAI: But, where do we go if we feel like making out in the middle of the game?"
"LUKE: I don't think they'd mind if we did it right here in front of them."
"LORELAI: Cool. Got a nice crowd here, Mr.Sponsor."
"LUKE: Not bad. Not bad."
"LORELAI: So, these are soccer moms, huh?"
"LUKE: They're just really bored spinsters."
"LORELAI: They seem very concerned with education and national security. (Luke chuckles. Maggie sees the tow of them walking around and runs up to the)"
"MAGGIE: Luke! Hi! You came!"
"LUKE: Oh, yeah. I thought I'd come down, see the girls in action."
"MAGGIE: Oh, they give it their all. You'll be proud."
"LUKE: I'm sure I will."
"LORELAI: Look at those girls. Look how cute they are in those uniforms."
"LUKE: Check out the other team's. Cheap fabric, cheap stitching."
"LORELAI: Look at the sponsor. Fred's dry cleaning. Ruined a favorite sweater years ago. Today he pays. (Tilly and Megan run up to Luke and Lorelai)"
"MEGAN: Luke!"
"TILLY: You came!"
"LUKE: Hey, girls. You ready to play?"
"MEGAN: We hope so."
"LUKE: The other team? I think you're gonna wipe the floor with them."
"MEGAN: I think we've got a sh*t."
"LUKE: No, I know you've got a sh*t. Don't forget. We're having a little celebration at the diner afterwards, win or lose."
"MEGAN: Cool."
"TILLY: We better get back."
"LUKE: All right. Have a good game."
"MEGAN: See ya!"
"LORELAI: Bend it like Beckham! (the girls run off) Oh, so, I dropped Paul Anka off at doggy day care. It was a little scary."
"LUKE: No, that'll be good for him."
"LORELAI: He seemed okay. He was a little standoffish at first, but then he got very friendly with the cash register. And then a dog ran up to him, and he played dead for a couple seconds, and when that didn't work, he ran off playing with the other dogs. I think it's gonna do him some good."
"LUKE: I think so, too. (the game begins) Oh, here we go."
"LORELAI: Oh, who got the ball?"
"LUKE: Well, The Bobcats lost the toss, so the other team got the ball."
"LORELAI: So, we've lost already?"
"LUKE: Just the toss. It means nothing."
"LORELAI: How many points are we behind 'cause we screwed up the tossing?"
"LUKE: Nothing, it just started. 0-0."
"LORELAI: Were we talking during the toss? How did we miss the toss?"
"LUKE: Just watch the game."
"LORELAI: Okay. Look at that Megan run."
"LUKE: Ooh, she's making her move."
"LORELAI: She's fast."
"LUKE: Yeah, see her coming up behind that girl? She's gonna try to steal and then move the ball forward and get it to the..."
"LORELAI: OH!"
"LUKE: OH! What was that?"
"SOCCER DAD: Good hustle, girls! Good hustle!"
"LORELAI: Is that girl unconscious?"
"LUKE: No, no, no. She's getting up. She's a little-little wobbly though."
"LORELAI: Is it okay for Megan to slam her elbow in that girl's neck like that?"
"LUKE: I don't think...(Tilly attacks girl who falls down) Oh, my God!"
"LORELAI: Oh! That was poor little Tilly."
"LUKE: There's blood. I see blood."
"LORELAI: Who is their coach? Sam Peckinpah?"
"MAGGIE: Way to go, Tilly. Dominate. Dominate."
"LORELAI: Shouldn't that be a foul or something?"
"MAGGIE: Oh, don't worry. Tilly is an expert at knowing when the ref is watching and when he isn't. Agression! Agression! Agression!"
"LORELAI: I cannot watch this. (hides her eyes. Luke keeps on watching the game which, from all the noises one can tell, is quite violent. We hear bunch and a groan, and Luke kinda steps back) Ah! I heard that. It was just as bad as seeing it."
"LUKE: Now I think that girl's unconscious."
"(CUT to soccer field parking, morning, later on. Everyone is making their way to their cars. Luke and Lorelai run to the truck, get in and look stunned)"
"LORELAI: It was...it was..."
"LUKE: Violent."
"LORELAI: ""Scarface"" on a soccer field."
"LUKE: Those little girls. Megan, Tilly."
"LORELAI: Animals! Animals!"
"LUKE: Did you see the blood on their jerseys?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I did! I did see that. And the refs, they look like they're afraid to call penalties."
"LUKE: Can you blame them?"
"LORELAI: It's Alicia. Duck. (they duck)"
"LUKE: Ohh...she's not coming after us. Although she is walking right toward us. Oh! She turned."
"LORELAI: Oh, thank God. (they sit up straight again)"
"LUKE: She turned away."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: Oh, those sweet, little 11-year-old girls."
"LORELAI: k*ll! k*ll all!"
"LUKE: They won. They won that game."
"LORELAI: Bobcats 37, humanity nothing. I don't want to go to another game."
"LUKE: Me neither."
"LORELAI: Good. (they look around a bit)"
"LUKE: Seems like a good time to get away."
"LORELAI: Yeah, they're all distracted. g*n it! g*n it! (Luke starts the car and they drive off)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion driveway, night. Jess is outside and starts throwing pebles at a window. Rory comes out and he gets startled. He sees it's her and relaxes as she walks up to him, chuckling)"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"JESS: (whispering) I didn't know if it was okay to ring or not."
"RORY: She's not here."
"JESS: (normal volume) She's not?"
"RORY: She's playing bridge tonight."
"JESS: Oh, good. I parked on the street so she wouldn't see."
"RORY: You're very good at covert ops."
"JESS: Years of practice. So, where do you want to go?"
"RORY: I don't know. I don't know the area that well."
"JESS: You live here."
"RORY: I know, but Hartford's still a mystery. Even when I went to Chilton, I got right on the bus and headed home. So I don't even have any old high school hangouts to revisit. And these days, I've just been eating here."
"JESS: Well, I just prefer not going someplace that has food in the title."
"RORY: Meaning..."
"JESS: Olive, chilli, soup. No gardens. No plantations."
"RORY: Got it. Something funkier."
"JESS: Steer me to the college district. I'll find us something funky."
"RORY: Sounds good. (a car drives up. It's Logan. Jess looks at Rory, she looks at Logan as he exits the car smiling) Logan."
"LOGAN: Am I interrupting something? (he walks up to them)"
"RORY: No. Hey. When did you get back?"
"LOGAN: Couple hours ago."
"RORY: Oh, I...I thought you were getting back tomorrow."
"LOGAN: I thought I'd surprise you, Ace."
"RORY: Well, I'm glad you did 'cause you get to meet my old friend, Jess. This is Logan, my boyfriend. Logan, this is Jess. He's in from out of town. (uncomfortable silence) Wow. That sounded so grown-up. We're at the age now where we say things like ""in from out of town"" and ""old friend"", 'cause when you're young, all your friends are new, and you have to get old to have old friends. (uncomfortable chuckling from Rory. Logan extends his hand to Jess)"
"LOGAN: How you doing? (they shake)"
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: We were just gonna go grab a bite to eat."
"LOGAN: Great. Well, how about if we all go together. Is that okay?"
"JESS: Okay by me."
"LOGAN: Good"
"RORY: All right. Good. We were actually at a loss for where to go, so you actually saved us."
"LOGAN: Call me superman. (at Jess) Why don't you follow us."
"JESS: Sure. (Logan puts his arm around Rory's shoulders and stears her to the passenger side of his car. Rory is a bit uncomfortable with the gesture)"
"LOGAN: Great. Come on."
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, evening. Lorelai enters and notices all her shoes lined up leading to Rory's room. Paul Anka is laying in front of Rory' bedroom door. Lorelai leans over him concerned and starts petting him)"
"LORELAI: Baby. (feeling his nose) Ohh."
"(CUT to Luke's diner, evening. Luke is sitting with the team. They are occupying a few tables. The girls are eating burgers and Luke is trying to talk to them)"
"LUKE: Look. I'm not saying take a dive or let them win..."
"TILLY: Good burger."
"LUKE: Thanks, I'm not even saying let them score a goal, which the other team did not. (Megan and Tilly high-five)"
"MEGAN: Yeah! Shutout!"
"TILLY: Donut!"
"SOCCER GIRL: They ate some dirt."
"LUKE: They did. They did. They ate some dirt. You fed it to them, but all I'm saying is do you have to hit them so hard?"
"MEGAN: It's part of the game."
"TILLY: Yeah, you have to be aggressive, or they'll roll over you."
"MEGAN: You're not being competitive if your jersey doesn't have a little O negative on it."
"LUKE: I know. Absolutely. But, uh, for example, Megan, that bicycle kick you did."
"MEGAN: Bicycle kicks are allowed."
"LUKE: Not on another girl's head."
"MEGAN: She was all up in my grill!"
"LUKE: I know, and I don't like it when people are all up in my grill, but there are other ways to deal with it."
"TILLY: We play the way the boys play."
"SOCCER GIRL: Watch them. You'll see."
"LUKE: But boys are boys, and girls are girls. (the girls react and Luke is a bit shocked)"
"MEGAN: I cannot believe I'm hearing this."
"TILLY: So we're just supposed to play like cute little girls like we're at some tea party?"
"LUKE: I'm not saying that."
"TILLY: We want to win. Which means we gotta kick some butt!"
"THE WHOLE TEAM: Yeah!"
"LUKE: (looking at Tilly stunned) You were so shy when I met you. (the telephone rings) I'll be right back. (Luke walks over to the counter to get the phone and listens to girls, resigned, for a bit talking about how they ""creamed those guys"". On the phone) Luke's."
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, continuous. Lorelai is in the living room on the phone. The scene CUTS between Luke at the diner and Lorelai at home)"
"LORELAI: Hey. It's me."
"LUKE: Hey, what's wrong?"
"LORELAI: It's Paul Anka. He's sick."
"LUKE: He's sick?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. He doesn't want to walk or eat or anything. He's never been sick in his whole life. I mean, I haven't had him his whole life, so it's possible that he's been sick in his life. I'll never know for sure, but to me it's as if it's the first time he's ever been sick."
"LUKE: He got sick when he ate that chocolate. Did he eat more chocolate?"
"LORELAI: He hasn't eaten chocolate. He hasn't eaten anything in two days."
"LUKE: Get him to the vet."
"LORELAI: I did. The vet just said that he has some sort of bug and to let him be until it passes. I feel so helpless."
"LUKE: Well, I've got the team here, so as soon as they're gone, I'll come over. I mean, they wolf it down like pigs, so it's not gonna be that long unless they want a third helping."
"LORELAI: Maybe I should take him back to the vet."
"LUKE: Just let Paul Anka be. Dogs are dogs. They know how to heal."
"LORELAI: Paul Anka isn't a dog. He's some sort of hybrid. Maybe that vet doesn't specialize in hybrids."
"LUKE: Sit tight. I'll be over soon."
"LORELAI: Okay. Bye."
"LUKE: Bye. (they hang up. Luke turns around just in time to hear the girls laughing and Megan say)"
"MEGAN: She went one way and her knee went the other. (the girls cheer as Luke sighs and walks back over to them)"
"(CUT to Rich Man's Shoe, evening. Rory, Logan and Jess are sitting at a table twith their drinks talking)"
"LOGAN: I live pretty close. I'd have had you over to check it out, but it's a bit of a mess."
"RORY: And you don't serve food, so we would have been starving at your place."
"LOGAN: I've got appetizers, half-full bag of chips. Just check the expiration date before you dive in."
"JESS: I'm good with this place."
"LOGAN: Little pointer. Don't come on folk night."
"JESS: Yeah, I'm not a big fan of folk music."
"LOGAN: Something we have in common."
"JESS: Great. (looks at Rory who looks back at him a bit uncomfortable)"
"LOGAN: Where's a waitress? (at a waitress) Yo, yo. Right here. Uh, another McKellen's neat, and, Jess, another brew?"
"JESS: I'm still working on this one."
"LOGAN: Another one, just in case. (the waitress walks off)"
"RORY: Well, we should probably order. It's a big menu, so if you need guidance..."
"JESS: I'm not hungry."
"LOGAN: You're not hungry?"
"JESS: Nope."
"LOGAN: I thought the whole point was you two were going to get something to eat?"
"RORY: And talk."
"LOGAN: Well, yes, it's a given that you're gonna talk while you eat. You know, chef de cuisine will gladly make anything you want if nothing there appeals."
"RORY: The burgers are good here."
"JESS: Maybe a burger."
"LOGAN: Get one of those fancy ones, too, and it's on me, so don't let the price stop you."
"JESS: I'll pay for my own. (looking through his menu)"
"LOGAN: Good man. (reading his menu) So, how long have you two known each other?"
"JESS: (closes the menu) A while."
"LOGAN: You date?"
"RORY: Yes. We used to date."
"LOGAN: Ah! No hemming. No hawing. Good course of action. (closes his menu) So, were you two high school sweethearts? Rock around the clock, two straws in the milkshake?"
"RORY: Logan."
"LOGAN: Hey, did we cheers? I don't think we cheered. That's bad luck. Let's cheers."
"JESS: I think we did already, twice."
"LOGAN: Well, let's do it again. Cheers."
"RORY and JESS: Cheers. (they cling their glasses and drink)"
"LOGAN: So...what do you do, Jess?"
"JESS: Oh, this and that."
"LOGAN: Describe the ""this"". Describe the ""that""."
"RORY: He writes."
"LOGAN: You write? Impressive. What do you write?"
"JESS: Nothing important."
"RORY: He wrote a book."
"LOGAN: Oh, you penned the great American novel, Jess?"
"JESS: Wasn't quite that ambitious."
"LOGAN: So, what are we talking here? Short novel? Kafka length or longer? Dos Passos, Tolstoy? Or longer? Robert Musil? Proust? I'm not throwing you with these names, am I?"
"JESS: You seem very obsessed with length."
"LOGAN: I'm just trying to get a picture in my head, that's all."
"RORY: It's a short novel."
"LOGAN: (at Rory) Any good?"
"RORY: I haven't read it yet."
"LOGAN: Yet? Well, at least you'll have one reader. That's something."
"JESS: Yeah."
"LOGAN: You know, I should just write down all my random thoughts and stuff that happens to me and conversations I have and just add a bunch of ""he said, she said""-'s, and get it published. You got a copy on you?"
"JESS: No."
"LOGAN: You should send me a copy."
"JESS: Sure. And where do I send it? The blond dick at Yale?"
"RORY: Jess. (Jess picks up his coat and get up)"
"LOGAN: Whoa, whoa. We're just trying to keep it friendly here, buddy. (Logan gets up and blocks his way)"
"JESS: Get out of my way. (Jess by-passes him and walks out. Rory gets up and follows Jess)"
"LOGAN: Forget him, Rory."
"RORY: Don't follow me."
"(CUT to outside Rich Mans' Shoe, continuous. Jess is leaving and Rory runs up to him)"
"RORY: Jess, wait. (he stops and turns to look at her) Jess, I'm sorry."
"JESS: We shouldn't have done this."
"RORY: He's just in a bad way lately."
"JESS: He's a jerk."
"RORY: He was. In there, definitely. I'm so sorry."
"JESS: I read that guy the second I saw him. I should have begged off."
"RORY: Well, I didn't want you to."
"JESS: He better not come out here."
"RORY: Please, Jess. He had a lot to drink. He's tired from travelling. This isn't him. I swear."
"JESS: What the hell is going on?"
"RORY: I told you. He's tired, and his family's bugging him right now."
"JESS: No, no. I mean with you. What's going on with you?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"JESS: You know what I mean. I know you better than anyone. This isn't you."
"RORY: I don't know."
"JESS: What are you doing? Living at your grandparents' place, being in the DAR, no Yale...why did you drop out of Yale?!"
"RORY: It's complicated."
"JESS: It's not! It's not complicated."
"RORY: You don't know."
"JESS: This isn't you. This, you going out with this jerk, with the Porsche. We made fun of guys like this."
"RORY: You caught him on a bad night."
"JESS: This isn't about him. Okay, screw him. What's going on with you? This isn't you, Rory. You know it isn't. What's going on?"
"RORY: I don't know. I don't know."
"JESS: Hey, uh... may-may-maybe we'll catch up at a better time. (he starts to leave, but stops and turns) Happy birthday, by the way. Wasn't that a couple weeks ago, your birthday? (Rory nods. Jess nods back, smiles and leaves. Rory watches him go for a bit and re-enters the pub angry and determined)"
"(CUT to inside Rich Man's Shoe, continuous. Rory comes in and walks up to the table and Logan, who is sitting drinking from his glass. She does not sit but hoover's over him)"
"LOGAN: You're not gonna believe this. Over the music, the crowd, I hear one girl's voice cutting through it all, the folk singer. She's in the corner with her boyfriend. I sent them over a round of drinks. What the hell? He gone?"
"RORY: Yes, he's gone."
"LOGAN: Writers are so sensitive."
"RORY: You were a jerk, Logan."
"LOGAN: I was just challenging him. Jeez. Hey, if Hemingway can take it, so can he. Hey, if he wanted to, he could have taken a pop at me. Pugnacity! It's a vital component of literary life. Again, consult your Hemingway. Come on. Do not let this guy get to you."
"RORY: You're getting to me."
"LOGAN: Me?"
"RORY: Yes. You were an ass."
"LOGAN: Look, I'm sorry I came back early. I really messed things up here."
"RORY: Jess wrote a book. He wrote a book, and you mocked him."
"LOGAN: I did not mock him."
"RORY: He's doing something."
"LOGAN: Good. Fine. He's doing something. Everybody in the world's doing something. More power to him."
"RORY: I'm not. I mean, what am I doing? I'm living with my grandparents."
"LOGAN: That's temporary. Have a drink."
"RORY: Temporary can turn into forever."
"LOGAN: You're not living with the Gilmore's forever."
"RORY: I'm palling with my grandmother and being waited on by a maid. I come home, and my shoes are magically shined. My clothes are magically clean, ironed, and laid out. My bed is magically turned down. I'm in the DAR? I'm going to meetings and teas and cocktail parties?"
"LOGAN: Again, temporary. Have a drink."
"RORY: And wasting my time partying and drinking, just hanging out doing nothing."
"LOGAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa. (he gets up) Don't pull me into this."
"RORY: I didn't say anything about you."
"LOGAN: Yes, you did. Don't make me feel guilty for your drinking and partying. That's your choice. I'm not forcing you. When I ask you out, you can say no."
"RORY: It's all we do."
"LOGAN: It's not all we do."
"RORY: It's all you do."
"LOGAN: Well, it's my prerogative, you know. You're damn straight. I'm gonna party. I'm gonna do it while I have the chance because come June, my life is over."
"RORY: Oh, yes, your horrible life. Let's hear about it."
"LOGAN: Got a week?"
"RORY: You have every door open to you. You have opportunities that anyone would k*ll for, including me."
"LOGAN: No one's stopping you from making whatever you want happen. Go into journalism. Go into politics. Be a doctor. Be a clown. Do whatever you want."
"RORY: It's not as easy when it's not handed to you."
"LOGAN: Really? It's all so easy for me? (getting upset) I don't want that life. It's forced on me. You talk about all these doors being open? All I see is one door, and I'm being pushed through it. I have no choice. You try living without options."
"RORY: How hard are you fighting it?"
"LOGAN: I didn't tell you to quit Yale. You did that. I gave you one month, you went beyond that month, and it had nothing to do with me. It was all you. Now, you want to change? Change it, but don't blame me. Don't you dare blame me. You know what? Why don't you go off with John, Jack, whatever his name is?"
"RORY: Oh, I'm not going off with Jess. (Logan sighs tired form the fight)"
"LOGAN: Come on."
"RORY: Where?"
"LOGAN: Let's go. I want to go. I don't want to be here."
"RORY: I don't want to go."
"LOGAN: Well, I drove you here, and I want to go!"
"RORY: (determined) I don't want to go."
"LOGAN: Fine. (takes some money and throws it on the table) That'll cover the bill, cab. Do whatever you want. It's your choice. (Logan leaves and Rory is left alone watching him go)"
"(CUT to, Gilmore Mansion, morning. Emily walks up to Rory's room and knocks on the door)"
"EMILY: Rory, it's 7:30. (no answer so she knocks again) Rory? (she opens the door and enters)"
"(CUT to inside Rory's room continuous. Emily walks in and looks around, worried, in the empty room and made bed)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, morning. Luke is sleeping in Lorelai's bed in the living room. He reaches out to Lorelai and doesn't feel her in the bed so he wakes up and sits up in bed)"
"LUKE: Lorelai? (no answer so he gets out of bed, and starts making his way to Rory's room looking around for Lorelai. He reaches Rory's bedroom door, looks in and enters)"
"(CUT to inside Rory's room, continuous. Luke makes his way to the armchair Lorelai is sleeping in. Paul Anka in on Rory's bed also resting, wearing his ""Bobcats"" jersey. Luke sits on the floor next to Lorelai who wakes up abruptly after he nudges her. She looks tired and is in verge of tears)"
"LORELAI: Is he okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah. He looks the same."
"LORELAI: Is he breathing?"
"LUKE: He's breathing."
"LORELAI: Nice and steady?"
"LUKE: He's fast asleep."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: You been here all night?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I kept thinking I heard him."
"LUKE: Yeah, he does snore occasionally."
"LORELAI: And then he was cold, so I put his jersey on him."
"LUKE: Yeah, I think he likes it."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Every time I'd go back up to bed, you know, after checking on him, I just was convinced that he needed me, so I came back, and finally I just ended up here."
"LUKE: Ah, it's as good a place as any."
"LORELAI: Yeah. He doesn't want to eat anything. I had all these milk-bones ready for him, but he doesn't want anything."
"LUKE: What's the baster for?"
"LORELAI: In case he's thirsty, but he can't lift his head, so I can just sh**t water in his mouth."
"LUKE: Got it."
"LORELAI: (sighs) Doesn't seem to want anything."
"LUKE: He's gonna be okay. He's strong."
"LORELAI: He's so helpless. It must be so awful to be sick when you're a dog... 'cause you can't run or play and you don't watch TV or do anything to pass the time. Watching a lot of TV is the only good part about being sick."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: And the thing with the shoes. He was trying to tell me something."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: He was trying to tell me to put my shoes on and take him to the vet because he felt something coming on, and he was trying to ward it off, and I didn't take him."
"LUKE: I don't think that's why he was playing with your shoes."
"LORELAI: I tried so hard. I have a list of things that he's afraid of on the fridge, and I tried to do the right thing. I should not have so socialized him at Kirk's doggy day care the other day. I should have taken him to the best doggy day care in the country, even if it was in Seattle. That's where I should have taken him."
"LUKE: He's fine hanging with Kirk."
"LORELAI: I did this wrong. I did this all wrong. How could I have let this happen? How did I not see it coming? How didn't I step in and do something, and...why can't I fix these things?"
"LUKE: Hey. (he starts playing with her hair trying to comfort her)"
"LORELAI: (really starting to loose it now) I'm a bad mother!"
"LUKE: You're not a bad mother. Oh. Did you sleep at all?"
"LORELAI: A little."
"LUKE: You stay home this morning. I'll call Sookie and tell her you'll be late. He's gonna be okay."
"LORELAI: I hope so. (Luke reaches up to her and kisses her head)"
"LUKE: Everything's gonna be okay. (they sit and watch Paul Anka)"
"(CUT to Lane's apartment, morning. Rory walks in the kitchen from Lane's bedroom and walks up to Lane)"
"LANE: Good morning, friend."
"RORY: Back at you, friend. Where are the guys?"
"LANE: Uh, they go to work early. I made you coffee."
"RORY: Oh, I've got time for a sip. (Lane bring the pot and a mug and starts pouring) Thanks for letting me crash here."
"LANE: Anytime you want."
"RORY: I might take you up on that."
"LANE: I can't wait to hear the whole story."
"RORY: (after a long sip) Still living it."
"LANE: So, I got a message on my cell phone, from your grandmother."
"RORY: On your cell phone?"
"LANE: How did she get the number?"
"RORY: Ugh. She's Emily Gilmore. I gotta run. Bye. (starts gathering her things)"
"LANE: Drive carefully. (Rory exits)"
"(CUT to the Russian tea party. Waiters are serving tea and a traditional Russian band is playing music. Emily enters the hall looking around with an angry determined look. She spots Rory and walks up to her. Rory is giving instructions to one of the waiters)"
"RORY: A fresh platter is all we need. Thanks."
"EMILY: I need to go somewhere and have a little talk with you."
"RORY: Later, Grandma. I'm needed out here."
"EMILY: Young lady, I insist that we go somewhere and talk right now."
"RORY: Grandma, I am sorry. I can't."
"EMILY: There's a kitchen here. We'll go there."
"RORY: No. I'm not going to the kitchen with you. We'll talk later."
"EMILY: Must they play those damn guitars?"
"RORY: They're balalaikas."
"EMILY: They're too loud."
"RORY: They're Russian, and they're not mic'ed. That's their volume."
"EMILY: I'm not liking this tone of yours."
"RORY: Well, you're forcing the tone, Grandma. I said I'll talk to you later, but right now, I'm not leaving this room. (walks off, making her way through the hall and Emily follows her)"
"EMILY: Where were you last night? Why didn't you call?"
"RORY: You're overreacting."
"EMILY: You're not wearing your dress."
"RORY: I didn't have time to go home."
"EMILY: You almost missed the event."
"RORY: No. I was early for the event. What I missed was your inspection of me back at the house. That's what you're upset about."
"EMILY: My inspections, missy, are for your own good. You're new to the DAR. You don't know the proper procedure for things, the proper dress."
"RORY: I do okay."
"EMILY: This is not just about me. Everyone was worried about you."
"RORY: You mean everyone you called when you took my private address book and tried to find me?"
"EMILY: Yes, I did call people."
"RORY: Well, you shouldn't have."
"EMILY: A lot of good it did. You should update that ridiculous address book of yours. Half the numbers were disconnected."
"RORY: Oh, I'll do that."
"EMILY: You have people in there you haven't spoken to for years. You should remove them."
"RORY: Uh-huh."
"EMILY: I'm throwing that book out."
"RORY: Do not throw that book out."
"EMILY: Do not use that tone with me."
"RORY: I want to be very clear."
"EMILY: You are becoming more like your mother with every passing day."
"RORY: And you are becoming more like my mother's mother with every passing day."
"EMILY: That's it! That's it!"
"RORY: What's it?"
"EMILY: You're grounded."
"RORY: Grounded?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"RORY: I'm 21. You can't ground me."
"EMILY: And no more sleepovers at Paris' house."
"RORY: Grandma, I go wherever I want, whenever I want. And I haven't been sleeping at Paris' house three nights a week. I've been at Logan's."
"EMILY: When your father gets home, we're going to talk about the house rules and be on the same page once and for all."
"RORY: You mean my grandfather."
"EMILY: You know what I meant."
"RORY: Well, I'd have to be living at the house to have house rules."
"EMILY: What does that mean?"
"RORY: Excuse me. (turns around and walks away in a huff)"
"EMILY: (calling after her) Young lady, do not walk away from me. (Emily seeing as the conversation is over starts to leave, obviously upset, as the band keeps on playing)"

"(OPEN in Lorelai?s house. Lorelai opens the front door, which is chained and tries to get in the house)"
"LORELAI: Luke, hello? Luuuke! My door is chained! Which is especially funny, since I don't have a chain on my door. Luke!"
"LUKE (OS): Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: No. Land shark. Candygram. Here's Johnny. (frustrated) Uh! Luke, open the door!"
"LUKE (OS): Stay there."
"LORELAI: Oh, oh, okay. (tries to put her hand through the door and open it) God. (her hand gets stuck) Ow. Ow, I have a cramp. Luke, I have a cramp."
"LUKE (OS): Sorry."
"LORELAI: Huh... (Luke comes up to the door) I'm permanently stuck like this. (starts to wave her arm franticly)"
"LUKE: All right, get your arm out of the way so I can unchain the door."
"LORELAI: Sure. Just yell, ""stand up already!"" to the guy in the wheelchair. (Luke unchains and opens the door)"
"LUKE: I chained the door earlier to test it. Here. (hands her a glass of wine)"
"LORELAI: (taking the wine and coming into the house) Oh, what an odd reward system you have."
"LUKE: Come with me. (leads her to the living room)"
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"LUKE: We...are celebrating."
"LORELAI: Celebrating! What?"
"LUKE: Listen."
"LORELAI: ...Are you cooking?"
"LUKE: Is that listening?"
"LORELAI: Well, I'm hungry."
"LUKE: Focus."
"LORELAI: I'm hungry."
"LUKE: Ssshhhh."
"LORELAI: Fine. (they listen for a b*at) I don't hear anything."
"LUKE: Exactly."
"LORELAI: OooK...Simon, Garfunkel."
"LUKE: It's done."
"LORELAI: What's done?"
"LUKE: The house. It's done."
"LORELAI: No, it was supposed to take another week."
"LUKE: I know. I paid Tom a bonus to get the guys out of here early."
"LORELAI: And he finished everything?"
"LUKE: Yep! No more banging or sawing, no more paint cans lying around, cigarette butts in the potted plants."
"LORELAI: Well, they didn't put the light-socket covers back on. They'll have to come back to put the light-socket cov...(Luke start pointing at the light socket covers)"
"LUKE: Light-socket covers are on."
"LORELAI: What about the skinny, tiny, molding in the closet? They have to fix the skinny, tiny molding in the closet."
"LUKE: Skinny, tiny molding is done."
"LORELAI: Mmmm...Well, I'm sure they did not pick up all their tools. They'll have to come back and pick up their tools..."
"LUKE: You're not happy they're gone."
"LORELAI: No, I am. I just...I wanted to say ""goodbye""."
"LUKE: Goodbye?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I wanted to have a, you know, ""we're done"" party. Buy 'em some pizza."
"LUKE: More pizza."
"LORELAI: And I had going-away presents for them."
"LUKE: I gave them a going away present. A $2000 going-away present. That's got to bring some smiles."
"LORELAI: But I bought paper hats and noisemakers."
"LUKE: The place was covered with dust. You were getting woken up at six am every morning by the hammering. I thought you'd be happy."
"LORELAI: I am. I'm just sad at the same time. You've never been with a woman before?"
"LUKE: OK, fine. I've got another surprise for ya."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Upstairs."
"LORELAI: Where?"
"LUKE: Bedroom."
"LORELAI: (gasps) Upstairs in the bedroom? Whatever could it be? (they walk toward the staircase)"
"(CUT to upstairs hallway, continuous. Luke and Lorelai are walking towards the bedroom)"
"LUKE: Close your eyes."
"LORELAI: I'm not scared of it anymore, Luke."
"LUKE: Would you please just close your eyes?"
"LORELAI: OK. (she closes her eyes)"
"(CUT to inside bedroom, continuous. Luke opens the doors and they enter. Lorelai still has her eyes closed)"
"LUKE: (stops her as she keeps on moving in the room) Ah, nuh uh. You ready?"
"LORELAI: Ready."
"LUKE: Take a look. (Lorelai opens her eyes and looks around surprised, not in a good way)"
"LORELAI: Wow! What is this? (we see inside the bedroom, which is filled with old creepy looking furniture)"
"LUKE: This is my grandmother's bedroom set. It's in perfect shape. Can you imagine?"
"LORELAI: (forced interest and delight) Wow! (noticing the carving on the bed) Look at all the cherubs."
"LUKE: People have been trying to buy it off me for years, but I always felt that I would eventually find the perfect place to put it, you know?"
"LORELAI: (walking around the room) Uh-huh."
"LUKE: And then the room was done and just sitting there, and I remembered the day you came down to that storage unit, and you saw the furniture, and you said you liked it."
"LORELAI: I did?"
"LUKE: Yeah! And since you liked it and I've been looking for a place to put it, I figured..."
"LORELAI: When did I come to your storage unit?"
"LUKE: Five years ago. You needed to borrow that space heater."
"LORELAI: Oh, right."
"LUKE: And look. (picks up and old painting of a boat - assuming there are a few more of those) I haven't had a chance to put these up. Aren't they great?"
"LORELAI: (same forced tone) Yes. Yes, they are."
"LUKE: Yeah, I was tempted to get them reframed, but it just didn't seem right. (Lorelai notices the mirror of the dresser. It looks like it belongs to a fun House)"
"LORELAI: Oh. I've got one big eye. That's fun."
"LUKE: Yeah, that's the original glass. You can't find that anymore. So, you sure you like it?"
"LORELAI: I love it."
"LUKE: Great. OK. Well...let's get downstairs, 'cause I am making risotto. (they chuckle and Luke exits the room)"
"LORELAI: (a bit disappointed walk out after him) I just love it."
"(OPENING CREDITS)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion dining room, morning. Emily is sitting at the table reading her newspaper. Rory walks in and heads towards the kitchen. They don't exchange a word. The maid -Sumatra- starts pouring Emily some coffee as Rory walks out of the kitchen with a muffin in hand. She starts to exit the dinning room as Emily starts to talk to the maid)"
"EMILY: Sumatra, please get my granddaughter a plate."
"RORY: That's all right, Sumatra. I'm just going up to my room."
"EMILY: Sumatra, please tell my granddaughter that all food is to be consumed in the dining room."
"RORY: Sumatra, please tell my Grandmother ""What?!"""
"EMILY: That's the rule in this house, Rory."
"RORY: I'm late for community service."
"EMILY: Food in this house is meant to be consumed in the dining room or not at all."
"RORY: What about when you take your tea outside on the patio?"
"EMILY: That is in the afternoon. This is morning, and in the morning you eat your food at the table, in the dining room..."
"RORY: (cuts Emily off by leaving the muffin on the table with a tude) Fine. I'll be back this afternoon. (exits the dinning room while Emily stares at the muffin. She turns to look t the maid and the maid looks back)"
"EMILY: (to Sumatra) Well, if you expect that muffin to fly back to the kitchen, you better go get it a cape. (Sumatra takes the muffin and exits to the kitchen. Emily goes back to reading her newspaper, looking upset)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, morning. Sookie is cooking when Lorelai walks in holding a stack of papers and envelopes)"
"LORELAI: Hey!"
"SOOKIE: I have to go to China."
"LORELAI: Enjoy your flight."
"SOOKIE: I need inspiration. I need ideas. I'm tapped-out. Boring. You know what's on the menu tonight?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Goose with oyster stuffing."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I know. But that's all I could come up with. And then the only reason I thought of that was because Davey just learned ""duck duck goose,"" and the ducks looked puny, so there you go."
"LORELAI: Well say ""Hi"" to Yao Ming for me."
"SOOKIE: Will do. (takes an envelope that Lorelai has brought in and starts to open it) What is this?"
"LORELAI: This is a formal invitation, written by me, on the dragonfly notepad, about five minutes ago, inviting you and Jackson to a housewarming dinner at my newly completed pad."
"SOOKIE: (Gasps) It's done."
"LORELAI: Done!"
"SOOKIE: Saturday night."
"LORELAI: I've heard it's all right for fighting. Get a little action in."
"SOOKIE: Wow. Your house is done. This is so exciting! How does it look?"
"LORELAI: It, uh, looks great."
"SOOKIE: It, uh, does?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: Why do you hate it?"
"LORELAI: I don't hate it. It's beautiful. It's just...What if Jackson brought home a set of his grandmother's pots and pans? Now, obviously, you need some pots and pans, and these are free and all, but they're really old. And you don't want to hurt Jackson's feelings 'cause he feels very sentimental about the pans, but they've got fat cherubs carved all over them, and you just don't want them."
"SOOKIE: Do the cherubs interfere with the actual cooking function, or are they just decorative?"
"LORELAI: Well, decorative is a wildly generous description, but function's fine."
"SOOKIE: What happened to my old pots and pans?"
"LORELAI: Uuh...Gone. Thrown out."
"SOOKIE: Can I get them back?"
"LORELAI: Babette's nephew, Gary, is sleeping on them."
"SOOKIE: Sleeping on them?"
"LORELAI: I'm not really talking about pans, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Well, what are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: I'm talking about Luke's grandmother's bedroom furniture that he set up in my brand-new bedroom."
"SOOKIE: Oh."
"LORELAI: And he loves this furniture."
"SOOKIE: And you don't?"
"LORELAI: No, I don't. But it shouldn't matter, right?"
"SOOKIE: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Look at everything Luke has done for me. I mean he bought and then he un-bought the Twickham House, and then he almost bought it again, and then he decided to live at my house because I wanted to live at my house."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, he did."
"LORELAI: He has turned his whole life upside down for me. He does everything in his power to make me happy and give me what I want, so can't I just give him this one little thing?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, you can."
"LORELAI: No, I can't. The bed is small and really low, perfect for tiny, shrunken limbs that can't be too far off the ground. And then he has this ancient dresser with the original fun-house mirror in it so that when I wake up every morning, and I am at my most visually vulnerable, I'll look in there and think I'm that kid from ""Mask."""
"SOOKIE: You can replace the mirror."
"LORELAI: Oh, no. He loves the mirror. And the bed, and the dresser, oh, and the paintings! Did I say about the paintings?"
"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: Of sailboats?"
"SOOKIE: Ohh."
"LORELAI: There's six of them. Six sailboats waiting to sail me away to an old-folks home. And then, when the wind's right, drop me off at the pearly gates. I'm hateful and selfish."
"SOOKIE: No, you're not."
"LORELAI: I just want my new house to be perfect. Half that crap in there was hand-me-downs to begin with. You know I had that old bed that Mia let me snag from the Independence Inn. I just wanted something new."
"SOOKIE: You have to tell him."
"LORELAI: I can't tell him."
"SOOKIE: Maybe it's not so bad."
"LORELAI: Well, you'll see for yourself"
"on Saturday night. 7:30?"
"SOOKIE: Aye, aye, captain."
"LORELAI: Huh...(exits the kitchen and Sookie goes back to her cooking)"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, morning. Richard walks in the house and starts walking around and looking through mail while talking loudly in what seems to be an empty house)"
"RICHARD: Emily! Sorry to be so late. Jenson wouldn't stop talking. The car will be here in 20 minutes to take me to the airport. Remember, I'm not going to be back until Tuesday, so you're going to have to deal with Alejandro yourself. (walks into the sitting room area and sits on a small desk to write a check) I will leave you the check. All you have to do is hand it to him and tell him that if there are any problems I will be back to talk to him on Wednesday. I hope you told the maid to pack my raincoat. Forecasts are predicting Armageddon, apparently. Now, I have a stopover in Las Vegas. Is there anything that you want me to bring you back? (Finn and Colin start walking down the staircase holding boxes full of stuff)"
"FINN: Your safe return, darling, is all I need.(Richard looks around at the boys with a surprised and confused look)"
"RICHARD: Who the hell are you?"
"FINN: Well, if I knew that, I could dismiss my therapist, couldn't I? Though she's very hot."
"COLIN: I'm Colin McCrea."
"RICHARD: How wonderful for you. (get up from the desk and approaches the boys) What are you doing in my house? Put that box down. Both of you. (the boys put the boxes down) Explain yourselves."
"COLIN: Mr. Gilmore, I'm Colin McCrea. You know my father, Andrew McCrea."
"RICHARD: Yes, I know Andrew McCrea. What are you doing in my house? Where's Mrs. Gilmore?"
"FINN: Don't know, mate. Rory let us in."
"COLIN: We came over to help her move her stuff."
"RICHARD: Move her stuff where?"
"FINN: To her new place of residence."
"RICHARD: What do you mean ""new place of residence""? Rory's moving out?"
"FINN: I hope so. Otherwise, she'll have nothing to wear tomorrow."
"RICHARD: That's preposterous! A person doesn't just move out without a word. Where is she? Rory!"
"FINN: She already left."
"RICHARD: Well I want an explanation."
"COLIN: We'll have her call you. (starts to pick up his box)"
"RICHARD: You! You'll ha...What are you doing with that? (pointing at the box) That's my tennis racket."
"FINN: I told you she didn't point to the closet on the right."
"COLIN: Well then I have no idea what closet she was pointing to."
"FINN: I suppose these humidors aren't hers, either. Pity. (to Richard who looks very confused) Any chance you're sick of them? I promise to give them a nice home and show them a picture of you every year at Christmas.(Richard points upstairs and walks away. The boys look at him go) Very tall man, that one. (Colin picks up his box and starts going back upstairs)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Lorelai is sitting on a table examining the nachos that she has on plate in front of her. Luke comes by her table)"
"LUKE: They're gonna to get cold."
"LORELAI: Are they different?"
"LUKE: Different than what?"
"LORELAI: They seem different."
"LUKE: They're nachos. Now eat them."
"LORELAI: You used baked chips."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: You did, didn't you? You used baked chips and low-fat cheese."
"LUKE: I did not... use low-fat cheese."
"LORELAI: Ha!"
"LUKE: How can you tell?"
"LORELAI: How could you lie?"
"LUKE: They taste the same!"
"LORELAI: Oh, the trust, Luke. How are we gonna to make it if you're constantly trying to keep me healthy?"
"LUKE: Fine. Forget it. Die at 60. (takes the plate and walk away)"
"LORELAI: Bring me a doughnut while I wait. (Lane notices Lorelai and tries to avoid and ignore her) Hey, Lane. Yoo-hoo! Lane! Whoo! (wildly gesturing) Lane, seriously. Landing planes over here. (Lane gives up and goes over to her table)"
"LANE: Lorelai. Hey."
"LORELAI; Hey. Fill me up here. (Lane fills up Lorelai cup with coffee while avoiding eye contact) Sooo, how's it going?"
"LANE: Good."
"LORELAI: Good. I haven't seen you the last couple days."
"LANE: I've been working the lunch shift."
"LORELAI: Oh. Something wrong?"
"LANE: Wrong?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, you're giving me a Valerie Cherish, you know, and ""I don't wanna see that!"". (Lane doesn't get it and seems uncomfortable) It's a great show. You should watch it."
"LANE: I will."
"LORELAI: It's cancelled."
"LANE: Oh, sorry."
"LORELAI: Well, it's your fault, so...Wow, what's going on here? Usually when I come in, you say ""hi"", and then I say ""hi"", and you tell me what's going on in your life, and I tell you what's going on in my life. It's not curing the bird flu or anything, but it's been a nice tradition."
"LANE: Rory moved in with me."
"LORELAI: She...But why? What happened?"
"LANE: I don't really know. We haven't had the in-depth conversation yet. She just said she moved out of her grandparents' house and needed a place to crash."
"LORELAI: Wow, that's pretty big."
"LANE: Yeah. And she didn't tell me if I could say anything to you, so I just assumed I shouldn't."
"LORELAI: Right, I get it. I heard nothing. So, it's nice of you to let her crash."
"LANE: Hey, she's small. How much room can she take up, right?"
"LORELAI: Did she bring her books?"
"LANE: Good point. Are you okay?"
"LORELAI: Me? Sure. I'm fine. A little curious, but I'm fine."
"LANE: Well, when I know more..."
"LORELAI: Right."
"LANE: OK."
"LORELAI: OK."
"LANE: OK."
"LORELAI: OK (Lane walks away and Lorelai is left alone at the table)"
"(CUT to Lane's apartment, morning. Rory is sitting on the kitchen counter working on her computer. Lane is fussing with prepping a sandwich, which she serves Rory)"
"LANE: Lunch is served."
"RORY: Such service."
"LANE: I'm just in it for the tips."
"RORY: Underwear first, then pants."
"LANE: What a shame I'm away from my snare drum. Want a soda?"
"RORY: Please. Soda me. (Lane goes over to the fridge to get that soda as Zach walks in)"
"ZACH: Shampoo's looking low."
"LANE: I'll get more tomorrow."
"ZACH: (to Rory) Four people in the house sure makes the shampoo go away faster, huh?"
"RORY: I brought my own shampoo, Zach."
"ZACH: Hey, not a judgment, just an observation. (looking at Rory's sandwich on the counter) Two paper towels, huh?"
"LANE: Relax, Zach. (gives Rory the soda and starts fussing with making her own sandwich)"
"ZACH: Hey, it's cool. Just paper towels don't grow on trees. They cost money. Use two a day for a month, that's like 60 paper towels. You're looking at 24 rolls per year."
"RORY: I'm not staying that long, Zach."
"ZACH: Hey, Lane's casa es su casa, apparently. (picks up a box of serial) Oh, cool! Don't have to strain myself by lifting a full box. Excellent."
"RORY: I'm not staying that long, Zach."
"LANE: She's not staying that long, Zach."
"RORY: A couple of days, tops."
"ZACH: Yeah? (to Lane) Remember Don? He came for a couple days, tops, once. Six weeks later, he's still here. Ate all my cheese nips. But when I confronted him with the box, he said they were just settling. Dude had cheese-nip breath as he told me they were just settling."
"RORY: (her phone starts ringing) Oh my God, Zach, I am not staying that long. (picks up her cell and walks away from the kitchen counter) Hello."
"STUART: (on phone) Rory Gilmore, please."
"RORY: This is Rory Gilmore. (scene cuts between Lane's apartment and Stuart's office)"
"STUART: Rory, this is Stuart Woltz, of the Stamford Eagle Gazette."
"RORY: Mr. Woltz, yes. Thank you so much for calling me back."
"STUART: No problem. Listen I got your message and of course I'll be happy to give you a reference. I'll even make it a great one."
"RORY: Really?"
"STUART: Look, I don't really know what happened with you and Mitchum, but from me to you, you're a sharp kid, and you got a lot going for you. Anybody'd be lucky to have you working for them."
"RORY: Thank you so much."
"STUART: I know this'll shock you, but you're not the first person who couldn't get along with Herr Huntzberger. It's a pretty big club, actually. Ignore him."
"RORY: I plan on doing just that."
"STUART: Good. OK, so, just have whoever you want call me, and I'll sing your praises. Sorry I can't hire you at the Gazette, but we don't have any openings right now anyhow, so..."
"RORY: That's okay. The reference will be plenty."
"STUART: Good luck, Rory. I expect to hear great things about you someday."
"RORY: I promise not to let you down. Goodbye, Mr. Woltz. (they hang up. Rory starts walking back to the kitchen) Yes!"
"LANE: Good news?"
"RORY: References are now officially in order, which is a relief because I've already sent out 125,000 resumes."
"LANE: Oh, listen. I forgot to tell you. I may have done something stupid."
"RORY: What?"
"LANE: Well...I kind of told Lorelai that you've moved in here."
"ZACH: I'm sorry? ""Moved in here""?"
"LANE: Zach! There must be something else you can do."
"RORY: When did you see my mom?"
"LANE: This morning at Luke's. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know if you wanted her to know or didn't want her to know."
"RORY: It's OK. It's fine that she knows."
"LANE: Oh, good."
"RORY: OK! It's time to get dressed and hit the pavement. (starts to walk away. Lane stops her)"
"LANE: Wait. Your sandwich. (passes her the sandwich and Rory takes it)"
"RORY: Thank you. (exits)"
"ZACH: Sure, just leave your computer plugged in, sucking up all our energy."
"LANE: Zach!"
"ZACH: What? I'm just writing a song."
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, night. Lorelai and Sookie are setting the table for dinner)"
"SOOKIE: I can't believe you didn't do anything to the kitchen."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? Look at the brand-new napkin holder. It used to be a cow. Now it's a much bigger cow."
"SOOKIE: Fine. Forget it. (putting a platter in the oven) Chicken and dumplings going in."
"LORELAI: You do know the pile of burgers sitting in the refrigerator is intended for human consumption."
"SOOKIE: I never go anywhere without a casserole."
"LORELAI: Must make dining out rather awkward."
"SOOKIE: Look, if by some chance Luke happens to burn the chicken or overcook the burgers, then we won't starve. If everything turns out perfect, then you can freeze the casserole and eat it for the rest of your life."
"LORELAI: Perfect plan. (we hear some arguing from outside and a then Luke and Jackson enter through the kitchen door)"
"LUKE: Forget it."
"JACKSON: There is no shame in using a charcoal chimney."
"LUKE: (taking the uncooked burgers out of the fridge and passes one plate to Jackson) It's a gadget. I don't do gadgets."
"JACKSON: It takes twice as long."
"LUKE: You got someplace to be? (takes out another plate)"
"JACKSON: No, you just go right ahead and rub those sticks together. I'll just go learn a language or something."
"LORELAI: (to Luke) Bernardo."
"SOOKIE: (to Jackson) Riff."
"LUKE: And a real man doesn't use a charcoal chimney."
"JACKSON: Oh, so now I'm not a real man?"
"SOOKIE: He is too. I have pictures to prove it."
"JACKSON: Do you have a spray bottle?"
"LUKE: For what?"
"JACKSON: To spray the flames down if they get too high. Or do you just use a hose?"
"LORELAI: No, he blows them out with his man-breath."
"SOOKIE: And then he challenges them to an arm-wrestling contest."
"LORELAI: And then he insults the flame's mother and sleeps with its girlfriend. (the men exit the kitchen through the kitchen door) And the next time you come back, you better be carrying food!"
"SOOKIE: OK. Boys are busy. The chicken's in the oven. Show me the bedroom set."
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: I want to see the creepy granny bed."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm trying to rise above it."
"SOOKIE: Rise above it later. Let's go. (they start walking towards upstairs)"
"(CUT to bedroom, continuous. Sookie and Lorelai enter)"
"LORELAI: Here it is."
"SOOKIE: Huh."
"LORELAI: It's terrible, right?"
"SOOKIE: Well, it's..."
"LORELAI: Terrible?"
"SOOKIE: Reeeeally terrible."
"LORELAI: I told you."
"SOOKIE: (sits on the bed) Ow. Oh, my god. (she lies back starts trying to roll around a bit to test it) You can't sleep in this."
"LORELAI: Don't worry, I won't. I'm convinced it's haunted, and one night Luke will come back from the bathroom and find nothing but a bloody hook hanging from the cherubs."
"SOOKIE: Oh, my God. I just saw the cherubs. (gasps, gets up quickly and stands next to Lorelai) OK, let's think. Maybe if you stripped the wood."
"LORELAI: And lit a match?"
"SOOKIE: Throw on a little gasoline."
"LORELAI: I can't tell him I hate it."
"SOOKIE: Yeah, you have to. It's horrible."
"LORELAI: Yes, but Luke loves this furniture."
"SOOKIE: Right. Luke loves this furniture. Luke loves this furniture. Luke loves this furniture?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"SOOKIE: Has he seen it? (pointing at the dresser) Has he seen this? And that (pointing at one of the paintings) has he seen that? (from downstairs the phone starts to ring)"
"LORELAI: (chuckles) Come on. (they start to exit)"
"SOOKIE: (while walking towards the door points at the bedside table with a lamp on it) Oh, now, I know he hasn't seen that."
"(CUT to living room, continuous. PA is sitting on the stairs as Lorelai and Sookie walk down. The phone keeps ringing)"
"SOOKIE: I'm going to check on the chicken. (as they reach the living room the machine beeps)"
"CHRIS (On answering machine): Hey, Lor (Sookie and Lorelai look a bit surprised), haven't said that in a while."
"SOOKIE: Is that... (Lorelai nods)"
"CHRIS (On answering machine): Anyway, hope you're good. Hope Rory is good. I wanted to talk to you. Nothing terrifying. I think I have good news. (Luke starts to walk in from the kitchen and as he hears the message he stops) In fact, I know I have good news. (Lorelai notices Luke and quickly goes to turn off the machine) Anyhow I'm hoping you'll call me back and..."
"LORELAI: Hey. How's the food coming? I'm starving."
"LUKE: Who was that?"
"LORELAI: Uuuhh..."
"LUKE: It sounded like Christopher."
"SOOKIE: Bye-bye. (walks away into the kitchen quickly, as Luke moves closer to Lorelai)"
"LORELAI: Well, if you knew who it was, why'd you ask?"
"LUKE: Were you going to tell me he called?"
"LORELAI: Luke, yes."
"LUKE: Then why'd you turn the machine off when I walked in?"
"LORELAI: It was a reflex."
"LUKE: Reflex?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I panicked. I didn't think. I looked up, and you were standing there."
"LUKE: How long has this been going on?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You talking to Christopher. I assume it's just talking, right?"
"LORELAI: Yes. No, no. No talking, no anything. There's nothing going on."
"LUKE: Fine. (turns to walk away)"
"LORELAI: Are you leaving?"
"LUKE: Burgers are done."
"LORELAI: Let's talk about this."
"LUKE: I don't want to argue in front of guests."
"LORELAI: Last time we were over, Sookie breast-fed Martha during appetizers. We owe them."
"LUKE: I won't discuss this with people in the house. It's rude."
"LORELAI: No, it's rude to silently sulk through dinner and make them feel uncomfortable because they know we're fighting and we're pretending we're not fighting."
"LUKE: We're not fighting...Yet. (Luke walks back into the kitchen)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's kitchen, night. Lorelai, Luke, Sookie and Jackson are having dinner. Jackson is narrating a story, Sookie is quiet and Lorelai and Luke don't really seem to be into the mood)"
"JACKSON: So, we're standing in a giant pile of manure, and I am screaming, ""I asked for extra fish heads!"". And he's like, ""No, you did not ask for extra fish heads"". Oh, I tell you. It was hilarious! (an awkward pause) And of course all the celery guys are staring, and then ""tomato"" George - we call him ""tomato"" George. He's got extra time on his hands right now 'cause tomatoes are out of season - anyhow, he steps in and says, ""I don't want to hear another thing about the fish heads"". (Jackson chuckles as he expects a reaction from his punch line. He gets none) He's from Kansas."
"SOOKIE: The burgers are delicious, Luke."
"JACKSON: Oh, yeah, I like them burnt. You can't get anyone to really burn a burger anymore."
"LORELAI: The chicken and dumplings are good, too. (Luke looks t Lorelai accusingly) What? (he snorts) Nice snort."
"LUKE: I didn't snort."
"SOOKIE: (nervously) People in Kansas talk funny. (chuckles to relieve the tension. It doesn't work)"
"JACKSON: Did I miss something?"
"SOOKIE: Always, honey."
"LORELAI: It's nothing, Jackson."
"JACKSON: Oh. I bet I know what's going on."
"LUKE: Nothing's going on, Jackson."
"JACKSON: Oh, yes, it is. It is not lost on me that the burgers with my world-famous rub are almost gone, while your butter burgers are still sitting there on the plate. You a little humbled now?"
"SOOKIE: Jackson."
"JACKSON: My burgers are better! (to Luke) Admit it! I demand satisfaction."
"SOOKIE: Sorry. He's just so excited to be around grown-ups."
"JACKSON: Hey."
"LUKE: No. That's fine. He's right. His burgers are better."
"JACKSON: Thank you. I crown thee burger king."
"LUKE: I can admit it. I have no trouble telling someone something no matter how uncomfortable it might make them."
"LORELAI: Wow. They'll be debating the subtle complexities of that comment for years."
"JACKSON: Okay, I did miss something."
"SOOKIE: Lorelai and Luke are fighting."
"LUKE: We're not fighting."
"LORELAI: No, we don't fight in front of company."
"LUKE: It's rude."
"LORELAI: Yeah, and we wouldn't want to be rude."
"LUKE: It's fine. Just eat. What's that?"
"LORELAI: Chicken and dumplings?"
"LUKE: Who the hell made chicken and dumplings?"
"LORELAI: Sookie, our guest, who we don't want to be rude to."
"LUKE: I'm not the one who started this."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. Are we talking about this now?"
"LUKE: You knew how I'd feel about it..."
"LORELAI: And you have absolutely no reason to be upset."
"LUKE: I don't? You were hiding..."
"LORELAI: I wasn't hiding anything."
"LUKE: You hung up the phone just as I came..."
"LORELAI: You didn't let me explain. I was about to tell you what happened"
"LUKE: At that moment, it was not appropriate to talk about it..."
"LORELAI: So you'd rather just sit and stew and be mad for no reason?"
"LUKE: So, it was just a weird coincidence that I walk in and Christopher happens to be leaving a message, and it happens to be the first time you've had contact with him in a month?"
"LORELAI: In a year, Luke! The last time I saw him was the last time you saw him!"
"LUKE: Well, I don't believe in coincidences."
"LORELAI: This is not fair!"
"LUKE: I have a right to expect honesty from my fiance!"
"LORELAI: OK! You want honesty? I'll give you honesty. I hate that bedroom set. It's old and creepy, and I hate it."
"LUKE: You told me you loved it."
"LORELAI: I have absolutely no memory of coming to your storage unit five years ago and telling you I love that furniture. (Sookie and Jackson loon on the argument quiet and uncomfortable)"
"LUKE: Well thank you very much for your honesty about my grandmother's furniture. Too bad you're not a little more forthcoming about the other men in your life."
"LORELAI: Oh, my god. Enjoy Wisteria Lane, you major drama queen."
"LUKE: I'm done. (gets up off the table and walks out of the house)"
"LORELAI: (yelling after him) Wrap yourself in a towel and trip over a hedge on your way out!"
"SOOKIE: Are you okay?"
"LORELAI: I'm fine. I'm sorry, you guys. I'll give Paul Anka the burger. (gets up, takes her plate and walks out of the kitchen)"
"JACKSON: Was it because I brought up my meat rub?"
"SOOKIE: Yes, it was."

"(CUT to Luke's apartment, same night. Luke is sitting on his armchair drinking a beer, and we hear a knock on the door)"
"LUKE: Come in. (Lorelai enters holding a plate and approaches him)"
"LORELAI: OK, see...Once we're married, you're not going to be able to run away to your clubhouse anymore. You're going to have to join a rotisserie baseball league with the rest of the men."
"LUKE: When we're married, huh? Gee, when's that going to be?"
"LORELAI: I brought you something to eat. You're going to need sustenance if we're going to go another 10 rounds."
"LUKE: I'm never going to be okay with Christopher being in your life."
"LORELAI: I'm always going to have Christopher in my life."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: (sits on the coffee table opposite Luke and puts the plate down) He is... Rory's father. I can't change that. Today was the first day I heard Christopher's voice in a year, and I would have told you."
"LUKE: We can't hide things from each other."
"LORELAI: I know."
"LUKE: I'm not going to like it when Christopher calls, but we have to tell each other everything."
"LORELAI: Agreed."
"LUKE: That's the only way this is going to work."
"LORELAI: I know."
"LUKE: You really hate the bedroom set?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I really hate the bedroom set. But I'm sorry I told you like that."
"LUKE: Yeah, well... (takes a deep breath) So, how are Sookie and Jackson doing?"
"LORELAI: I think they enjoyed watching a show for once that didn't have la-la playing the guitar."
"LUKE: Come here."
"LORELAI: (sliding over to sit on Luke's lap) I want a barbie and a pony and roller skates and roller skates for the barbie and for the pony. (they kiss)"
"LUKE: No secrets?"
"LORELAI: Cross my heart and hope to die."
"LUKE: Oh, I hate that saying."
"LORELAI: No secrets. (they kiss again) Luke."
"LUKE: (gives her peck on the lips) Yeah?"
"LORELAI: When I was in fifth grade, I told everybody Erik Estrada was my boyfriend and that we used to make out on his motorcycle."
"LUKE: Shh. (they kiss again)"
"(CUT to Stamford Eagle Gazette reception desk, morning. Audrey, the receptionist, is answering several calls, the office looks busy. Rory is sitting by the desk waiting. Stuart Woltz walks quickly to the reception desk and when Rory notices him perks up)"
"AUDREY: (on phone head set) Stamford Eagle Gazette... I'll transfer you. Stamford Eagle Gazette... I'll transfer you. Stamford Eagle Gazette... I'll transfer you. Stamford Eagle Gazette...I'll transfer you."
"STUART: (to Audrey) Did Bergman call?"
"AUDREY: Stamford Eagle Gazette. (passes a note to Stuart, and then point over at Rory) Try the New York Times."
"STUART: What?"
"AUDREY: Trust me. You want the (points again at Rory) Times."
"STUART: (confused) What!? What are you pointing to?"
"RORY: She's pointing at me. (Rory gets up from her seat as Stuart turns around to see her)"
"AUDREY: Stamford Eagle Gazette."
"STUART: Rory Gilmore."
"RORY: As you live and breathe."
"STUART: (walks up to her) Uh...I'm sorry. Did we, uh...?"
"RORY: No, we didn't have an appointment. I thought I would come down and talk to you about a job."
"STUART: A job?"
"RORY: A beginning staff writer job, to be exact."
"STUART: OK, I think maybe we got our signals crossed earlier. I thought I was clear. I don't have any jobs available."
"RORY: No, you were very clear. You said you didn't have any jobs available, and I heard you. I have excellent hearing, among my many other qualifications, which I have listed here on my resume (gives him a big brown envelope)"
"STUART: (taking the envelope) Your...?"
"RORY: And my portfolio. (turns and picks up two huge files) Samples of all my writing. All my work from the Yale Daily News, plus a couple spec pieces that I've just recently finished. Ideas, potential pitches, theatre reviews...(Gives him the files)"
"STUART: Well, I'm sure this is all..."
"RORY: Look, I know this is very spur-of-the-moment, but I thought maybe we could find a minute to sit and talk with me."
"STUART: About what?"
"RORY: About a job."
"STUART: But I don't have any job openings."
"RORY: I know, but see earlier, when we were on the phone, you were so positive and optimistic. You said so many complimentary things. I mean, frankly, you made me sound great, so great that I thought, ""Hey, you should hire that girl""."
"STUART: But..."
"RORY: I already know most of the staff. The rhythm of this place, how it runs. I know where you keep the pens. I have personally fixed the copier in that coffee room on more than 10 occasions. But the bottom line is... Mitchum was wrong. I am a very good writer, and I have great organizational k*ll, yes, but I know how to come at an article. I have a point of view. A voice. And - huh, big selling point - I am a huge bargain."
"STUART: Rory, these are wonderful points, but I have nothing at this moment."
"RORY: If you could sit down and talk with me, I bet we could work that out."
"STUART: I have no time to sit and talk with you today. I'm sorry."
"RORY: Look, I have sent my resume to several other papers. I'm not worried about finding a position. I'm worried about finding the right position. The right place for me. I think this is the right place for me."
"STUART: Well it's not the right place for you, because there is no place for you. I have no job openings."
"RORY: Give me ten minutes of your time, and I bet I can change your mind."
"STUART: I don't have ten minutes. (gives back her portfolio)"
"RORY: I would be invaluable to you here."
"STUART: If I gave you a job, I'd have to fire Harry. (sets the brown envelope with her resume on top of her portfolio that he?s just handed back to her)"
"RORY: Five minutes."
"STUART: Sorry."
"RORY: That's okay. I can wait. (sits back down. Stuart looks at her frustrated for a bit and then walks away)"
"AUDREY: Stamford Eagle Gazette...Yes, how may I help you?"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. It seems to be the lunch rush. Luke is running around taking orders and serving customers)"
"LUKE: (setting two plates on an occupied table) Steaks and eggs, tuna melt."
"CUSTOMER1: I ordered onions on this."
"LUKE: Yes, you did. I'll be right back. (walks over to the counter and yells into the kitchen) Caesar, I got onions coming."
"CUSTOMER2: This is not rare/medium-rare. It's more like just rare."
"LUKE: Caesar, onions. Gimme. (takes the plate with the ""more like rare"" order and passes the plate to Caeser) Add a little medium to this rare."
"CAESAR: The stove is going blinky."
"LUKE: No excuses. Let's go, go, go. (walks over to another table and prepares to take an order)"
"CUSTOMER3: Cobb salad, no avocado, no bacon, no blue cheese, Italian dressing on the side."
"(outside we see through the window a girl on a bike and a very weird bike helmet on riding up to the diner and parking her bike)"
"LUKE: Something to drink?"
"CUSTOMER3: Iced tea, two lemons."
"LUKE: Got it. (walks back to the counter to pass the order) Caesar, cobb salad, no cobb, just turkey. Where's that burger? (the girl with the helmet still o her head walks in the diner and goes up to the counter)"
"CAESER: The stove is going..."
"LUKE: ...blinky, I know. Use the broiler."
"APRIL: (to Luke) Luke Danes? Excuse me. Are you Luke Danes?"
"LUKE: Yeah, grab a seat. (pouring iced tea in a class) I'll be with you in a moment. (passing the glass to a customer sitting on the counter) Iced tea, two lemons."
"CUSTOMER4: But I didn't..."
"APRIL: You're Luke Danes."
"LUKE: (starts to write something on his order pad) Yes, kid, I'm Luke Danes. (notices the funny helmet) What the hell are you wearing?"
"APRIL: A bike helmet."
"LUKE: For what kind of bike?"
"APRIL: A Schwinn."
"LUKE: OK."
"APRIL: When you fall off your bike, you fall on your face."
"LUKE: Fine."
"APRIL: You could lose your teeth or hurt your neck."
"LUKE: Whatever. What do you want to eat?"
"APRIL: Nothing."
"LUKE: Then I need the stool space."
"APRIL: You told me to sit here."
"LUKE: Well, I thought you were going to order something."
"CAESER: Burger, rare!"
"LUKE: Yeah! (runs back up at Caeser, April follows) Where's my onions?"
"CAESER: I forgot the onions."
"LUKE: Get my onions! (passes back the plate and notices April smiling at him. He walks to her on the other side of the counter) Look, kid, whatever you're selling..."
"APRIL: I'm not selling anything."
"LUKE: I know, but I'm working, I'm bus...Will you take that thing off?"
"APRIL: OK...(starts to take off the helmet. It seems to not be so easy) it takes a minute. (Luke sighs as he waits for her to take the thing off. Finally she does and sets it on the counter) OK...it's off. Can I talk to you now?"
"LUKE: Talk fast."
"APRIL: I need your hair."
"LUKE: Excuse me?"
"APRIL: With the roots."
"LUKE: For what?"
"APRIL: I go to Martin Van Buren Middle School over on Woodbridge. Do you know it?"
"LUKE: No."
"APRIL: Well, every year Samuel Polotsky wins the science fair. Now, it's very important that I b*at him this year because I hate him. This year I have the perfect project. I'm going to take hair samples from three men, run DNA tests on them, and figure out which one's my father."
"LUKE: What?"
"APRIL: My uncle works for a lab in Hartford, so he's going to oversee me. But I'll be doing all the actual work myself."
"LUKE: I'm sorry. Did you say your father?"
"APRIL: Yeah, see, science fairs have gotten so political lately. It's no longer the simple act of science being appreciated. There's got to be a twist, a gimmick. Something flashy. I figure this is perfect. Real science, DNA testing, with a flash of human drama. ""Who's my daddy?"". Huh? Catchy, right?"
"LUKE: I don't understand. I'm not..."
"APRIL: I already have the other two samples. This is my last stop. I go to the lab tomorrow, and the fair's on the 16th. And, if I win, there's going to be a banquet on the 18th, and you get to choose any two kinds of spaghetti that you want. There's going to be at least ten options, though I know what I'm getting. Split order, half mushroom, half mizeethra cheese."
"LUKE: No!"
"APRIL: Yes, that's what I'm getting."
"LUKE: No. I mean, no. I'm (April reaches out and grabs some hair off Luke)...Ow! (she takes out a camera and takes a picture of him)"
"APRIL: Thanks. (picks up her helmet and leaves) Wish me luck! (Luke is left looking after her very confused)"
"(CUT to Stamford Eagle Gazette reception desk, morning. Rory is sitting at the reception desk area reading a paper. Stuart and Harry pass by her and are talking about something work related)"
"STUART: We can't print the letters, Harry."
"HARRY: But if they're true? What if Gonzalez really is taking these payoffs? It would finally make the city-council elections interesting."
"STUART: We have no idea who's making these accusations. It could be a hoax. Kids with too much time on their hands, no dates for the prom."
"HARRY: Or it could be a rival candidate. Now wouldn't that be fun?"
"STUART: Yes, that would be fun."
"HARRY: Then let's have some fun. (notices Rory) Hey, Rory."
"RORY: Hi, Harry. (Stuart notices Rory sitting in the reception area and looks at her surprised. She gets up from her seat and starts to follow them around)"
"HARRY: OK, so, we don't print the letters, but if we can track down the person who's sending them."
"STUART: How?"
"HARRY: I don't know. We do a paper analysis, rummage through trash cans."
"STUART: Very dignified."
"HARRY: Or maybe we can just call the guy up. Tell him we know he's sending the letters, lie, see if we can smoke him out."
"RORY: You know, you can use language-analysis software to ID an author by comparing his writing style to known writing samples."
"HARRY: What?"
"RORY: Yeah. That's how Joe Klein was unmasked as the author of ""Primary Colours."""
"STUART: Hell, it's worth a try."
"HARRY: Great. (Harry walks away looking pleased)"
"STUART: Good idea, Rory."
"RORY: Thanks, boss."
"STUART: I'm not your boss."
"RORY: Not yet, boss, but give me five minutes of your time..."
"STUART: I don't have five minutes. (starts to walk away from her)"
"RORY: OK, I can wait."
"STUART: Oh, boy."
"RORY: (calls after him) You know where to find me. (watches Stuart walk away for a bit and then turns around to leave)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn, morning. Michel is organising the bookshelves. Lorelai walks in with more books in her hand)"
"LORELAI: More books."
"MICHEL: Urgh. What is wrong with people? Don't they know the written word is dead?"
"LORELAI: Uh, books are back. Oprah says. Did we order the new box slips yet?"
"MICHEL: Yes, and the envelopes. And the linen-delivery service has been replaced by one that actually has trucks that turn on. And I hired a horse whisperer because Cletus has been acting very needy lately, and I get enough of that from you."
"LORELAI: Well, you're just perfect."
"MICHEL: Oh. And I got a call from someone who wanted a job reference for Rory."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MICHEL: Don't worry. I said nice things. I did not mention how she used to steal stamps and sit in my chair. I said she was very responsible and a hard worker, and now you owe me the weekend off."
"LORELAI: A job reference?"
"MICHEL: Yes."
"LORELAI: From who?"
"MICHEL: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Who was calling? Who was inquiring? Who was asking?"
"MICHEL: Someone who needed to hire someone."
"LORELAI: What kind of job was it?"
"MICHEL: I don't know."
"LORELAI: What was the name of the company?"
"MICHEL: he told me but I do not remember."
"LORELAI: Michel."
"MICHEL: What? I'm not an answering machine. I do not have ""Sony"" stamped on my forehead."
"LORELAI: Miche... (her cellphone starts ringing) Forget it. Hello?"
"(CUT to Gilmore mansion, continuous. Richard is on the phone. The scene cuts between Lorelai at the Dragonfly and Richard back at the mansion)"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, your mother's missing."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RICHARD: I came home from Seattle, and she wasn't here. The bed doesn't look like it's been slept in."
"LORELAI: You have maids, dad. They probably made the bed."
"RICHARD: Your mother fired the maid. As far as I know, a new one hasn't been hired yet. Plus, I haven't heard from her in two days. I had a couple of phone calls yesterday, but they were fuzzy. I couldn't hear the other person, and then they hung up."
"LORELAI: Well, that could have been mom."
"RICHARD: Rory's moved out. Did you know this?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I heard. What happened?"
"RICHARD: Oh, I don't know what happened. I came home the other day and two strange boys were in my house moving Rory's things. She didn't even tell me she was going."
"LORELAI: Did she and mom fight?"
"RICHARD: How would I know? I don't know where your mother is."
"LORELAI: Did you call her cell?"
"RICHARD: No, I did not call her cell. In addition to losing my wife, I lost all control of my faculties. Of course I called her cell!"
"LORELAI: Well I don't know what to tell you dad. I haven't heard from mom or Rory."
"RICHARD: I'm calling the club. If you hear anything, you must call me immediately."
"LORELAI: I will."
"RICHARD: Don't be smart."
"LORELAI: I'm not being smart. If I hear anything, I'll call."
"RICHARD: Fine. (they hang up, and Lorelai goes to the Inn's kitchen)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn kitchen, continuous. Sookie is cooking as Lorelai walks in heading for the coffee maker clearly distracted)"
"SOOKIE: Hey. What's wrong? Is something wrong? (walks up to Lorelai) Are you upset? Did Luke bring home his great-aunt's living room set?"
"LORELAI: I don't want coffee."
"SOOKIE: OK, well, that's your choice."
"LORELAI: Something's going on, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Rory moved out, and my mother is awol. So they must have had a fight or something. Something happened there, something big. And of course I don't have Rory's cellphone number because I had to give her space like a big, stupid idiot. (takes her cellphone out and dials someone) I should have my head examined. Remind me to have my head examined."
"SOOKIE: Wait...Rory moved out?"
"LORELAI: And my mother is missing, and my father's a basket case, and I don't know what to think. (on phone) Hi, mom, it's Lorelai. You have got to call me when you get this message. OK. Dad is frantic, and we don't know where you are, so just call my cellphone as soon as possible. We just want to know that everything's all right. OK, bye."
"SOOKIE: What do you think all that's about?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, but I'm going to go find out. (exits the kitchen through the back door and Sookie returns to her cooking)"
"(CUT to outside, morning. Lorelai is walking up to Lane's apartment. We hear music coming from inside. Lorelai knocks the music stops and Brian answers the door. Zach is also in the house)"
"BRIAN: Hey, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hey. Brian, I'm looking for Rory."
"BRIAN: Oh, she's not here."
"LORELAI: She is staying here?"
"BRIAN: Right."
"ZACH: And if you see her, you might want to mention that we're mysteriously out of dish soap."
"BRIAN: We're also out of sponges."
"ZACH: We are? You didn't tell me we were out of sponges. Lorelai, come on."
"LORELAI: Come on what, Zach?"
"ZACH: I'm just saying. She's your daughter. Maybe you should chip in a little rent."
"LORELAI: Zach, didn't you guys use my garage as rehearsal space, rent free, for about two years?"
"BRIAN: Three, actually."
"LORELAI: Three years. Thank you, Brian. Yeah, so, I'll tell you what, Zach. Why don't I give you $40 for Rory, and you can give me $1,200 for the garage? What do you think? We got a deal?"
"ZACH: Hey, whoa, relax. I was just joking. We're cool. (Lorelai cell starts ringing)"
"BRIAN: You wanna to come in and wait for her?"
"LORELAI: I'm good. Thanks for the offer. (gets her phone out and answers it) Hello?... Mom, thank God. Have you called dad?... Where are you?...What? What are you... OK, just stay there, mom...Now, what was the hangar number again?"
"(CUT to inside plane, morning. Lorelai comes on the plane seeking Emily)"
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"EMILY (OS) : I'm in the cockpit!"
"LORELAI: Oh. Add that to the list of things I never thought I'd hear my mother say."
"EMILY: (comes out from the cockpit and starts to examine the plane) Well, hello, Lorelai. What are you doing here?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I was just in the neighbourhood, you know. How about you? What are you doing here?"
"EMILY: I'm looking at a plane."
"LORELAI: Because?"
"EMILY: Because you don't do something like buy a plane without looking at it first. I'm not Elvis."
"LORELAI: Ah. My mistake. I thought you were. I apologize for sending those policemen badges for Christmas. Mom, dad is pretty worried about you."
"EMILY: He is?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he said you didn't come home last night."
"EMILY: I didn't?"
"LORELAI: Well, he said the bed looked like hadn't been slept in, and you're between maids."
"EMILY: Oh, for heaven's sake! I did that. People don't even think I can make a bed? I can make a bed. I usually wind up remaking the bed after the maid makes it because she made it wrong the first place. I wonder if these seats could be moved around."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Yes?"
"LORELAI: You're not going to buy a plane."
"EMILY: Tell your father I'm fine and I'll be home in an hour."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: If you're not going to leave, then help. (takes a measuring tape and gives one end to Lorelai) Hold this up to the window. This plane is a time-share. We'll share it with three other people. The pilot is always on call, which means we can go anywhere we want at the drop of a hat."
"LORELAI: Where would you want to go at the drop of a hat?"
"EMILY: Anywhere, everywhere. I could travel with your father when he works."
"LORELAI: You can do that now."
"EMILY: Well, I can join him later if I don't want to leave when he leaves."
"LORELAI: You can do that now."
"EMILY: Well, you and Luke can borrow it. You can take it up to Maine for lobster rolls or down to Florida for some sun. This fabric is just horrible. It has to go. It all has to go."
"LORELAI: Mom, you can't replace the fabric."
"EMILY: (mocking tone) ""Mom, you can't replace the fabric! Mom you can't buy a plane""."
"LORELAI: It's a time-share. You have to share it with three other people."
"EMILY: Then I'll buy the whole damn plane myself!"
"LORELAI: OK, sorry."
"EMILY: You know what? I am tired of all this. I am tired of your attitude toward me. You look at me as a thing of amusement..."
"LORELAI: I don't."
"EMILY: ...Something to be pitied. To feel sorry for. ""Poor, out-of-touch Emily. She has nothing. She lives to organize parties and frivolous affairs. Who would want to do that? To be that?""."
"LORELAI: Mom, I've never thought that."
"EMILY: If I want a plane, I'll buy a plane!"
"LORELAI: OK! Good! Go for it."
"EMILY: It's my fault that Rory dropped out of Yale. It's my fault that she didn't go back. It's my fault that she's with Logan. It's my fault that she's not happy. It's my fault. It's all my fault."
"LORELAI: It's not your fault."
"EMILY: That's right, it's not my fault! I did nothing but take care of her. I bought her clothes. I got her a job. I guided her. I threw parties for her and introduced her to new people, new things, and she just... The way she talked to me, you would have been very proud."
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: Oh, yes. She looked at me just like you used to. With that defiant, ""who are you to be telling me what to do?"" sort of look. Then she left. Packed her things and moved out when I wasn't even there to see her go. No ""thank you"", no ""goodbye"". You would have been very, very proud."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"EMILY: Just let me buy my plane, Lorelai. Let me be frivolous and shallow, won't you, please?"
"LORELAI: OK. (starts to exit, but turns around) It's not the same, mom, what happened with Rory. It's not the same."
"EMILY: I lost her like I lost you. Feels remarkably similar to me."
"LORELAI: You didn't lose her like you lost me. She was never supposed to be there in the first place, she was always supposed to be at school. She just went back where she belonged. (turns) And you didn't lose me. (exits. Emily sits on one of the chairs and starts to cry)"
"(CUT to Stamford Eagle Gazette reception desk, morning. Rory comes out from the coffee room holding two paper cups. She gives one to Audrey who's on the phone)"
"AUDREY: (on phone) You're going to have to take that up with Mr.Abrams. Hold, please."
"RORY: Three sugars, non-fat milk."
"AUDREY: Thank you, sweetheart. (they both sip) God, you make good coffee."
"RORY: I've had years of training. You got someone on hold. (leaves to sit down)"
"AUDREY: Right. (on phone) Thank you for calling. How may I help you? (Stuart walks up to Rory not looking too pleased)"
"STUART: Rory Gilmore."
"RORY: (perking up) Yes, boss?"
"STUART: (holding up one of the huge files) Is this your portfolio?"
"RORY: Part of it. I've got more here if you need it. (picks up a seemingly heavy book bag) Clippings and pitches..."
"STUART: You do not go into other people's offices and leave things on their desks."
"RORY: I know. I'm sorry."
"STUART: I'm the editor of this paper. For God's sake, my office is private!"
"RORY: And very tidy."
"STUART: Stay out of my office. (gives her the file and starts to walk away. Rory looks a bit upset. He turns around) Five minutes."
"RORY: You read it?"
"STUART: I don't see you moving."
"RORY: Did you like it?"
"STUART: I remember something about you being a bargain? (walks back to his office)"
"RORY: (following him) Oh, thank you, boss. You won't be sorry, boss. Hey, you're not going to have to fire Harry, are you?"
"(CUT to science fair, morning. Luke walks in and starts looking around the booths. He spots April at her booth reading a book. He walks up to her and notices his picture on the top of the booth is circled while there are two other pictures of two other men who's faces are crossed out. She looks up from her book and notices him)"
"APRIL: Hi?"
"LUKE: Hi."
"APRIL: What are you doing here?"
"LUKE: Oh, I just came down to see the potato clock."
"APRIL: Hmm."
"LUKE: It's amazing a potato can do that."
"APRIL: Potatoes are extraordinary."
"LUKE: So, I guess, uh..."
"APRIL: Yeah. It's you."
"LUKE: And you're sure?"
"APRIL: Absolutely. You want to see my report? (gives him the report)"
"LUKE: Uh, yeah. (he takes it and starts going through it a bit) Oh. It's big. (chuckles a bit) Wow, you...sure wrote a lot of...things here. Hey, wait. There's a word in here I know. (chuckles again a little more nervously) So, you're, uh...smart, huh?"
"APRIL: I've never been tested."
"LUKE: But you...you did all this, so you must be smart. (looks at the cover of the report) April Nardini? So, your last name is Nardini?"
"APRIL: Yes."
"LUKE: So, your mom is... (putting two and two together) Anna."
"APRIL: Yes."
"LUKE: Oh, Anna. Wow. I haven't seen Anna in..."
"APRIL: ...about 12 years?"
"LUKE: Yeah. So, uh...how is she? Is she good?"
"APRIL: Yes."
"LUKE: Well, you know, that's...Anna Nardini. Oh, boy. Uh, I think I...I have to sit down."
"APRIL: You want my stool."
"LUKE: Yeah, thanks. (April gets up, Luke sits) Thanks...I'm just, uh, a little overwhelmed here."
"APRIL: You want a capri sun?"
"LUKE: No, that's OK. So, I'm your father."
"APRIL: Yes."
"LUKE: I didn't know about you."
"APRIL: I know."
"LUKE: If I did, I would have, uh...(some people pass by and notice Luke under his picture. Luke to them) Yeah, it's...it's me. Hi. I...I think I'm better now. (get up from the stool)"
"APRIL: Are you sure?"
"LUKE: Yeah. That's fine."
"APRIL: OK. (sits back)"
"LUKE: So, sorry you didn't win."
"APRIL: It's okay."
"LUKE: I feel a little responsible."
"APRIL: The solar pizza oven took first. Environmentalism is very in right now."
"LUKE: Right, well...Oh. Here. (hand her the report)"
"APRIL: Oh, you can keep it. I've got copies."
"LUKE: OK, thanks. (exhales uncomfortably) So, you want to get some ice cream or something?"
"APRIL: I can't. The winners have to give a presentation at six."
"LUKE: Right. (with a ""not so sure"" expression on his face) Should I stay?"
"APRIL: Why?"
"LUKE: Right. OK. So, I guess...I'll go."
"APRIL: OK. Thanks for coming by."
"LUKE: Yeah. Thanks for the report. I'll pick up a scientific dictionary on the way home, see if I can figure out what it says."
"APRIL: Norton makes a good one."
"LUKE: Norton! Got it. OK. OK. (clears his throat) OK. (walks away)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, night. Paul Anka is sitting on the staircase doing noting. Lorelai aimlessly walks around the house and sits on the couch. She turns on the TV and then after a bit turns it off. Picks up a magazine and goes through it for a bit but closes it not long after. She picks up one of PA's balls and calls him)"
"LORELAI: Hey. Paul Anka. Huh? Fetch! (throws the ball. PA does nothing) Ah, that's it. Let it get a head start. (the telephone starts to ring and Lorelai quickly picks it up) Yes, hello?"
"RORY: (on the phone) Mom?"
"LORELAI: Rory!?"
"RORY: (on the phone) I got a job!"
"LORELAI: What? Where?"
"(CUT to Rory in her car, continuous. Scene changes between Rory in her car and Lorelai at home)"
"RORY: At the Stamford Gazette. It pays less than I'll spend on gas to get there, but it's a job! A writing job."
"LORELAI: Yes!"
"RORY: And I'm going back to Yale. I already called them and talked to my Dean, and it's all arranged. I just have to find someplace to live, but, who cares. I'll figure it out."
"LORELAI: And this is what you want?"
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Aw, Rory!"
"RORY: I moved out of grandma's house."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know. I heard."
"RORY: Are you home?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I'm not."
"RORY: OK, I know you're home, but can I come over?"
"LORELAI: Yes! Yes! Come over!"
"RORY: 'Cause I'm staying at Lane's, and I don't know if you want me to, but..."
"LORELAI: Tell Lane you're moving out and get your butt over here right now."
"RORY: Well, okay, if you insist. (takes a turn)"
"LORELAI: Oh... (hears a car approaching from outside and goes over to the window. She sees Rory's car pulling in the driveway) Oh, my God."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You look just so much more silver than I remembered. (camera follows Lorelai as she walk to the door to go outside and great Rory)"
"RORY: Now, come on. Is it too much to expect after a lengthy separation to get some sort of heartfelt greeting? (Lorelai comes out from the house, Rory gets out of the car and they run to each other arms -Lorelai throws the phone on the lawn- and fall into a warm and tight hug) I'm sorry."
"LORELAI: You're sorry? I'm sorry."
"RORY: I was so mixed-up."
"LORELAI: I should have pulled you out of there."
"RORY: I was stupid."
"LORELAI: No, I was stupid."
"RORY: I was more stupid."
"LORELAI: Oh, boy. Time to get you back to Yale."
"RORY: Love you, mom."
"LORELAI: Oh...kid, you have no idea. (they hug tighter)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, night. Luke seems distracted as he's wiping one of the tables. Lorelai comes rushing in all excited)"
"LORELAI: Rory's back."
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: She's back. She's back at home, she's back at school, she got a job, and she did it all on her own. (goes behind the counter and starts putting some donats in a take-out container) She's at Lane's picking up her things, and then we're going to pull a major all-nighter. We need burgers, fries, onions rings, and anything else you can think of. Oh! I'm going to go next door and pick up some ice cream at Taylor's. (walks out from behind the counter and up to Luke) She's back. (she kisses him) We can set the date. We can get married now because Rory's back. (goes over to the diner door) Don't skimp on the fries. We don't want to lose her again. (she exits and Luke is left alone and looking miserable)"

"[Before we have the usual previously on collection of scenes.]"
"LORELAI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai dressed and sitting on the new bed, not the furniture Luke had in storage. She is putting her boots. She is tilting her head to listening for something or someone.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"RORY [OS from the bathroom]: What?"
"LORELAI: Make an occasional noise so I know you didn't pull an Elvis."
"RORY [OS]: Just putting the finishing touches on the face."
"LORELAI [snorts]: You're an infant. Hit yourself with a giant powder puff and get out here."
"RORY [OS]: I love this bathroom."
"LORELAI: Uh, too much! I need the sink."
"RORY [OS]: You need my sink? What about the other sink?"
"LORELAI [gets up and walks to the bathroom door]: Oh! I forgot I had two sinks!"
"RORY: Well, you do."
"LORELAI: Look at this. Two sinks. I'm so decadent. I could brush my teeth over this one and spit into that one."
"RORY: This is now my official favourite room in the whole world. Besides the Reading Room at the British Museum. But add a dome ceiling and ten million books and you've got yourself a horse race."
"LORELAI: Paul Anka loves this room too."
"RORY [laughs]: You ever hear that tape of him chewing out his band after a show? 'When I move, I slice like a hammer! The guys get shirts!'"
"LORELAI: That's the human Paul Anka."
"RORY: I don't believe the canine version exists."
"LORELAI: He is just laying low until he figures out you're not going to break his heart or eat his pig's ears or something."
"RORY: Well, the chicken's got to show his face so I can prove myself."
"LORELAI: So, what all do you have going on today? Oh, she's already got a list going."
"RORY [reading]: Follow up calls to Yale to make sure I'm all set up for spring semester, four hours of community service - I'm going to try to stretch it to five because I am tantalizingly close to being done - my engine light was on, but I already took care of that -"
"LORELAI: This morning?"
"RORY [noding]: Got to Gypsy's shop before it opened. There was only one other annoying early bird ahead of me, but I bribed Gypsy with a pack of Rolo's and she took me first."
"LORELAI: She is such a Rolo whore."
"RORY: I've got tons of e-mails to return, and, oh, I've got to get the Eagle-Gazette a bunch of stuff I've written."
"LORELAI: Okay. Don't forget to sleep, daughter of mine."
"RORY: Eh. And, uh, I've got to unpack and organize everything and that's it, for now."
"LORELAI: Okay, but you will have to leave the bathroom to do all that."
"RORY: Mm, reluctantly. See you downstairs.[She goes out the room.]"
"LORELAI [calling after her as she goes down stairs]: Okay. Hey, you have time to eat and hang out with me, don't you? Is that on your microscopic little list there?"
"RORY [OS]: I've timed out the rest of the morning for you."
"LORELAI: Good girl!"
"RORY [OS, shocked]: Oh! Oh, my God!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY [OS]: Come down here!"
"LORELAI: I'm coming!"
"LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai comes down to meet Rory on the stairs, she is stunned to see Paul Anka sitting on the coffee table.]"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: He has emerged. I'm assuming that's Paul Anka."
"LORELAI: Well, it ain't Louis Prima."
"RORY: Shoo! Shoo!"
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"RORY: He shouldn't be on the table."
"LORELAI: That's his favorite spot. What are you going to do next, tell him he can't drink out of my water glass?"
"RORY: Sorry. How should I approach him?"
"LORELAI: Follow me."
"RORY: 'Kay.[They slowly go down the stairs.]"
"LORELAI: Okay, stop. Now go in the kitchen and put sugar on your toes."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: And quickly! Because first impressions are crucial and you're blowing it big time."
"RORY: Sugar on my toes?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he loves sugar, so the first time you come close to him, if you've got sugar on your toes that he can lick and enjoy, you're in."
"RORY: He's going to lick it?"
"LORELAI: Go, quick!"
"RORY: Okay. [Running to the kitchen, stops at the sink and takes off her shoes.]"
"LORELAI [OS]: Wet your toes first so it sticks!"
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI [OS]: Dry sugar on a dry toe isn't going to work!"
"RORY: Oh, jeez. [Turns on the tap and moistens a paper towel to wet her foot, then tips sugar on it, spilling some on the floor.] I'm making a mess."
"LORELAI [OS]: Don't worry about the mess!"
"RORY: We're going to have ants!"
"LORELAI [OS]: Hurry!"
"RORY: I'm coming!"
"[Quickly walking back to the living room. Lorelai is now sitting on the coffee table next to Paul Anka.]"
"RORY: Okay, my toes are all sugared."
"LORELAI: Okay, good! Now do the hokey-pokey and turn yourself around."
"RORY [wary]: What?"
"LORELAI: All you have to do is pet him and you're in!"
"RORY: You're evil."
"LORELAI: Yes, I am."
"[Paul Anka hops of the coffee table and licks Rory's toes.]"
"RORY [petting him]: Hey, there, boy! Oh, that tickles!"
"LORELAI: Well, he's glad you're here! Wait a minute, you're here!"
"RORY: I know!"
"LORELAI: Wait right there."
"[Lorelai goes into the hall closet.]"
"RORY: Is this another trick?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm just getting something. [The ""Bop-it"" toy makes a noise.]"
"RORY: You're pulling out the Bop-it? You're already that bored of me?"
"LORELAI [returns with a hat box]: No. I just accidentally hit the Bop-it while I was getting this."
"RORY: You bought me a hat?"
"LORELAI: No, it's a hat box, filled with these. [Opening it she and gets out some bits of paper.] These are notes, written on whatever I had on hand at the time. Any time I had a topic I wanted to share with you or a random thought during that crappy time apart of ours, I jotted it down and threw it in the hat box so I wouldn't forget."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: I missed you, kid."
"RORY: Missed you too. [Smiling at each other.] So, hit me with 'em!"
"LORELAI: While we walk to Luke's. Come on. Some of these are pretty cryptic. [Reading]: Um, Lenny Kravitz - where did Lenny Kravitz -"
"RORY and LORELAI [together]: Get all his money?"
"LORELAI: Yes! One hit and he's buying a Fifth Avenue mansion."
"RORY: Maybe he went through Nicole Kidman's wallet when she wasn't looking."
"LORELAI: That's got to be it. [Reading another bit of paper] Computer MP down - oh. I want to download music. There's so much out there. Can you help me figure that out? MP3 players?"
"RORY: I can do that. Next?"
"LORELAI: Eh, Kirk skeet sh**ting."
"RORY: That's a bad combination."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's the first time the town church has taken g*n since the eighteenth century."
"RORY: I missed so much so quickly!"
"[They leave.]"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"TOWN SQUARE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking through town, across a street, heading to Luke's, reading more the notes.]"
"LORELAI: Okay. Babette - cats."
"RORY: Death?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Adopted another one?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Recorded their meows, did some editing and cut a record of them singing Ring of Fire."
"RORY: Well, that goes straight to the top of my charts."
"LORELAI: Oh, I started reading Beowulf, that new translation you recommended."
"RORY: The Seamus Heaney? Good for you."
"LORELAI: Yeah. And stopped reading Beowulf, jotted on the same slip three minutes later."
"RORY: Well, you gave it the old college try."
"LORELAI: Oh, this is a new one! Kirk's got a new hobby. He's doing -"
"RORY [together]: Doing Tai Chi?"
"LORELAI: How'd you know that?"
"RORY: Because he's doing it right there."
"[Rory points to Kirk, doing Tai Chi on the lawn.]"
"LORELAI: Is it possible for him to do something without looking a little silly?"
"RORY: He wouldn't be Kirk then."
"LORELAI [reading]: Bendleshnitz? [She shrugs.]"
"RORY: That's not English."
"LORELAI: I know. I'll add it to the ones that I can't make out. And - [reading another] - brazzlefrat."
"RORY: Another unreadable one."
"LORELAI: They're stacking up! [As they reach Luke's, Lorelai takes Rory's hand.] Okay. Now wait out here."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: It's a thing. A moment thing. Just wait here."
"RORY: Okay."
"[Lorelai enters.]"
"LUKE: Hey!"
"LORELAI: You ready?"
"LUKE: For what?"
"LORELAI: For this! The moment you've all been waiting for! [She vibrates her tongue.] Brrrr!"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: It's a drum roll."
"LUKE: It sounded more like a helicopter."
"LORELAI: Well, it's a drum roll, go with it, okay? [Luke murmurs his agreement.] Ladies and gentlemen, Rory Gilmore! [She opens the door.]"
"RORY [entering]: Hi Luke!"
"LUKE: Hey, Rory, you're back! [They hug, awkwardly.]"
"RORY: I'm back!"
"LUKE: Good! You look good. You look healthy, happy. Huh, here with your mom, both of you here. Yeah, it's great, you know! Yay! [Awkward pause.] I don't think I've ever said 'yay' before. Sounded weird."
"LORELAI: A little."
"LUKE: Come, sit, sit."
"[They sit down.]"
"RORY: What was that sound you were making?"
"LORELAI: A drum roll!"
"RORY: It sounded like a helicopter or something."
"LUKE: That's what I said."
"LORELAI: Has no one heard a drum roll before?"
"LUKE: Hey, I saved you the best table in case you showed up."
"RORY: In case? It was mandatory."
"LUKE: What can I get you? Ah, never mind. I'm going to bring you everything you like. I know what you like."
"RORY: Sounds good."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey! You were with me when I wrote this. [Holding up a notes.] Uh, what does it say?"
"LUKE [takes the note]: Oh, this is from that stupid Mexican restaurant we went to."
"LORELAI: Right. I wrote something on the other side."
"LUKE: Man, this place stunk!"
"LORELAI: I know, but read the back, there. I've got to know what it says."
"LUKE: Look what we paid! Unbelievable."
"LORELAI: Downright usurious! Now look at the other side, there. The brazzelfrat?"
"LUKE: They did charge me for that second beer! I never got it."
"LORELAI: Scandalous. But the other side."
"LUKE: Six bucks for guacamole."
"LORELAI [takes the paper back]: Oh, just bring me what she's having."
"LUKE: Coming right up. [He turns to leave.]"
"RORY: So, Luke, wait! You haven't told me anything about yourself. What's new with you?"
"LUKE: With me? Uh, nothing. We're engaged, your mom and me."
"RORY: I know that, but anything else?"
"LUKE: No. No, why?"
"RORY: Just wondering."
"LUKE: What have you heard?"
"RORY: Nothing. That's why I'm asking."
"LUKE: Well, there's your answer. Nothing. Nothing's new. [Nods.] I'm going to go put in your order, okay?"
"RORY: Sure."
"[He leaves.]"
"LORELAI: We'll be waiting hungrily!"
"RORY: Did I inadvertently step into something there?"
"LORELAI: No idea."
"[Lane comes to the table.]"
"LANE: Mother and daughter, together again, and all is right with the world. Hi, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi, Lane."
"LANE [to Rory]: So. Next Wednesday night, I need you. Tell me you're not busy."
"RORY: I'm not sure, why?"
"LANE: We're doing a showcase. Me and the band. Not a gig, a showcase. And a label's going to be there. [Lorelai eagerly gasps.] I'm shaking! I shouldn't shake, I'm a drummer! It'll mess up the b*at. But, my God, we're playing for a label."
"RORY: Wow! Lane, I'm absolutely there. This is big!"
"LANE: Very big. Unless it's a 'Waiting for Guffman' thing and the label guys don't show up. Did I just jinx it?"
"RORY: I don't know. Let's do that un-jinxing thing we used to do, just in case."
"LANE: Good."
"[They link pinkie fingers.]"
"RORY and LANE [solemnly, together]: Jinx back, double pinkie, round the side, double pinkie, jinx back. [Clapping their hands twice together.]"
"LORELAI: Hey, I want to do that!"
"RORY: It's a serious thing, Mom! You don't just do it."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"RORY: Well, Lane, you guys are so prepared for this. That tape you gave me of your new stuff was awesome!"
"LORELAI: Hey, what if I jinx it! Do I get to do the un-jinxing thing then?"
"LANE: If we jinx-back a second time within the hour, it cancels out the first jinx-back."
"LORELAI: Sorry."
"LANE: So, what were your favorites on the tape?"
"RORY: Well, 'Melissa' was catchy, and 'Colleen Francine'. But that other one - 'Rebecca in the morning'? That was my favorite."
"LANE: Mine too!"
"RORY: Zach's into songs with girl's names, huh?"
"LANE: He thinks that's our best sh*t at radio play. Worked for the Police, the Knack, Franz Ferdinand."
"RORY: Good thinking."
"LANE: Hey. Do you want to be our DA Pennebaker? We're borrowing a video camera, and we need someone sober to do the photography."
"RORY: I could set my crack pipe aside for the night and do that."
"LANE: Thanks! [Taking out her notepad.] You plus one, right?"
"RORY: Plus one?"
"LANE: You plus Logan?"
"RORY: No. Just me."
"[Lorelai looks concerned.]"
"LANE: Oh, okay. How about you, Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Working that night, sweetie, but break a leg. Does that get me a hand thingy?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Rats."
"LANE: See you guys."
"[She leaves.]"
"LORELAI: So, just you, huh?"
"RORY: Just me."
"LORELAI: Okay!"
"RORY: As long as you're prying -"
"LORELAI: I wasn't."
"RORY: Briefly, succinctly, Logan and I are not talking right now."
"LORELAI: Ah."
"RORY: We had a fight. A big one, in public."
"LORELAI: Oops."
"RORY: I think we just needed a little break, a least I did. It's more like a hiatus."
"LORELAI: Well, sometimes a break is good."
"RORY: Sometimes."
"[Luke brings them their food.]"
"LUKE: Food. First wave only. Second wave, five minutes."
"RORY: Let's dig in."
"LORELAI [eagerly]: I hope it's not cold. Oops, I think I jinxed it!"
"[She holds up her hand and Rory plays along.]"
"RORY and LORELAI [together]: Jinx back, double pinkie, round the side, double pinkie, jinx back."
"LORELAI: Woo!"
"DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN"
"[The kitchen is busy with staff and Sookie cooking.]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, where's the onions for my sauce? Who's my onion man?"
"CARL: Right here, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Okay, right here, Carl. I need them right there. Okay? Get the shallots in it. It's time. It's time! [She tastes a sauce.] Okay. Needs more garlic. Come on. Godfather it up for me. [To the woman chopping herbs] Good! Good, good, good. Good, good. Okay. If you can travel back in time and make me not make the veal and ham pate, I'd appreciate it. Talk me out of these things in the future, guys."
"LORELAI [comes up behind her]: Hello!"
"SOOKIE: Hello!"
"LORELAI: Could you step away from the pan, please?"
"SOOKIE: Honey, do you see a joystick? This is not a game. Okay? It's a heche sauce and it's for keeps!"
"LORELAI: Put it down!"
"SOOKIE [turns to Lorelai]: Okay! What?"
"LORELAI [calling]: Okay!"
"[Rory comes in, Sookie shrieks in excitement throwing her hands in the air. They hit Carl in the face, knocking him over, a bowl of food is knocked to the floor.]"
"SOOKIE [hugs Rory]: Oh, my God!"
"RORY: Hi Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: You're here! You're with us! Oh, look, I missed you!"
"RORY: I missed you!"
"SOOKIE [gasps, to Lorelai]: This means you can set a wedding date. No impediments!"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I already told Luke."
"SOOKIE [breathless]: Hyperventilating! [She gives a thumbs-up signal to Rory and Lorelai how look worried.] Hyperventilating! I was just working on my list of what to make for Thanksgiving and I was wishing you were going to be here and now you are! [Still gasping] Oh my God! What if what I'm wishing for is actually coming true?"
"LORELAI: Quick! Wish for a Sephora to be built within walking distance."
"RORY: Do you need a paper bag?"
"SOOKIE: I'm good, I'm good. Just happy. [She sighs. Michel enters.]"
"MICHEL [smiles cheerfully]: Rory!"
"RORY [amazed]: Oh, hi! Wow, Michel."
"MICHEL [back to serious voice]: Hi."
"LORELAI: Boy, that was weird."
"MICHEL: She just surprised me, that's all. [To Rory] It's kind of okay that you are here."
"RORY: It's kind of okay with me too."
"SOOKIE [shouting suddenly]: Lunch!"
"RORY: What?"
"SOOKIE [points at Rory forcefully]: Lunch! I'm making you lunch!"
"RORY: But we just -"
"LORELAI: Don't fight it."
"SOOKIE: It just came to me. Kebabs. Okay, drop everything, boys! We're making kebabs for Rory, and pot stickers! Okay, throw everything out. This is a celebration! Woo!"
"LORELAI: Let's get to higher ground."
"[Rory and Lorelai turn to leave the kitchen.]"
"LANE'S HOUSE"
"[Band meeting.]"
"ZACH: Okay, we're opening with Melissa, closing with Dear Maureen. Those are great bookends, it's the middle part that's screwing us up."
"GIL: Aw, man, I wish we had one more ballad."
"ZACH: I'm half finished with one, but it's not going to be ready in time. [Singing] I saw her, in the mist she came walking by, Stella. Now a blur, made a list of what I like about her, Stella."
"BRIAN: Cool!"
"GIL: Yeah! It's got a nice Fountains of Wayne meets the Shins crossed with Odyssey-era Zombies, and a mix of early Who and mid-to-late-era Replacements vibe to it."
"ZACH: Well, that's what I was going for. Still hunting for that middle eight, you know?"
"LANE: So, um, it's called Stella?"
"ZACH: Yeah, I guess. Didn't you like it?"
"LANE: No, it's good. It's just - it's another girl's name."
"ZACH: So?"
"GIL: If he were singing about dudes, I'd be out the door before you could say 'See ya'!"
"ZACH: Look, Lane, you know how I write. I think about people that I've known and I draw inspiration from that."
"LANE: I know, it's just, no big deal or anything, but have you ever thought to write one about, I don't know, a girl named Lane?"
"ZACH: Well, Lane just isn't that great of a name for a song."
"LANE: But you've already got one called Lorraine. Lorraine is pretty much Lane with an extra syllable thrown in."
"ZACH: True, but nothing rhymes with Lane."
"LANE: I'm sorry, but a million things rhyme with Lane."
"ZACH: Yeah, rain. Pain. All cliché stuff. You're not a writer."
"BRIAN: I think you could come up with non-cliché stuff to rhyme with Lane."
"ZACH: Wait, maybe I could write one about your Korean name. What was that again?"
"LANE: Hyung-hyung?"
"Zach [cringes]: O for two. Look, it's not your fault. You didn't pick your name, your mom did."
"LANE: Right. I didn't pick it."
"ZACH: Okay, so. Where were we? Oh. Lorraine. Where should Lorraine go?"
"GIL: Try it after Rebecca."
"BRIAN: It's not as good a transition as going from Rebecca to Linda Marie."
"ZACH: True is true."
"GIL: Man. I wish Stella was ready."
"[Lane looks unhappily at Zach.]"
"DRAGONFLY INN - DINING ROOM"
"[Rory and Lorelai are sitting at a table piled with food, Lorelai is reading more notes.]"
"RORY: Three days."
"LORELAI: Three days he had the hiccups."
"RORY: Poor Paul Anka."
"LORELAI: And by sneaking up on him to scare them out of him, he jumped so high, his head split my lip. See the red? My blood."
"RORY: Yuck."
"LORELAI: Oh. Um, here's a non-fun one. Just to mix it up a little."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Your dad called."
"RORY: Wow. It's been, like a year, hasn't it? When did he call?"
"LORELAI: The very worst possible time."
"RORY [rolls eyes]: He's got a knack for that."
"LORELAI: I didn't talk to him. He left a message, some of which Luke overheard and it freaked him out."
"RORY: That's understandable."
"LORELAI: And we argued, see? Arguing's not just for the younger demographic."
"RORY: Nice to know."
"LORELAI: But then we made up and we had a good talk and then I listened to the rest of Christopher's message and he wants to see me."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: He didn't say. He sounded very chipper. He said he had something very important to discuss with me, and that it wasn't a trick, and that it was an absolute one hundred percent positive thing for me and for you."
"RORY: For both of us."
"LORELAI: Mm-hm."
"RORY: Meaning there's a ninety-nine and ninety-nine one hundredths percent chance that it won't be."
"LORELAI: I guess so. So what should I do?"
"RORY: You could ignore him."
"LORELAI: That's dangerous, too."
"RORY: It's a slippery slope with Dad."
"LORELAI: What could it be about? I mean, he wouldn't dare be in cahoots with Emily and Richard on something, would he?"
"RORY: He's not that dumb."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but he's vulnerable. They prey on the weak."
"RORY: But he said it's something positive. It couldn't involve them."
"LORELAI: Maybe he's getting back together with his wife."
"RORY: Well, that's not technically good news for us, it's just news."
"LORELAI: Maybe it's about Gigi. Maybe he's discovered she's a prodigy. Maybe he's calling to invite us to her premiere at Carnegie Hall."
"RORY: Playing what instrument?"
"LORELAI: The flugle horn."
"RORY: She's three. We would have read about it in the paper by now. 'Freakishly talented three-year-old flugle horn prodigy discovered'."
"LORELAI: It would be very positive news."
"RORY: Hm. Well, I'm out."
"LORELAI: Me too. '"
"RORY: I guess there's only one way to find out."
"LORELAI: Guess so. [groaning] Brazzlefrat."
"RORY: Bendleschnitz."
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Liz buttering a baking pan standing behind the counter.]"
"LIZ: Thank you so much, big brother. What a godsend you are."
"LUKE: Yeah. God sent me to help you and now he must pay."
"LIZ [to a customer]: You know, I've never made dinner for twelve people before. Actually I've never made dinner before. See, I'm making rolls for my thanksgiving dinner tomorrow, and I just don't have the oven space. Or the oven."
"LUKE: Just hurry, Liz."
"LIZ [to the same customer]: See, I've got a convection oven and a microwave, and that's going to take care of everything else. See, I'm a student of Martha. You know Martha Stewart? She's a genius."
"LUKE: Don't bother the customers, Liz."
"LIZ: You know, they're all Renaissance Faire people coming to this thing, Luke. You know some of them."
"LUKE: Goody."
"LIZ: Larry with the 'k*ll 'em all' tattoo on his face, and Freddy, the guy who doesn't have thumbs."
"LUKE: Don't tell me, he's hitch hiking in."
"LIZ [laughing]: You're funny. Really, Luke, I'm calling you Yakov from now on!"
"LUKE: Just try not to be too intrusive, please, Liz?"
"LIZ: Yes, sir! [She hits the package on the counter over and over again.] Hey, that's fun!"
"LUKE: Okay. This is not what I call not being intrusive."
"LIZ: Okay, I know this. Two 'not's is a double negative which makes it a positive, and - you know what, this is where I always lose my train of thought."
"LUKE: You're intruding."
"[Liz peels back the paper on the tube and it open up. Laughing, she looks at the dough inside.]"
"LIZ: Is this one roll? It's crazy!"
"LUKE: You separate 'em."
"LIZ: Oh, boy. My carpal tunnel. That's going to make doing this impossible. [To the customer] Hey, do you mind giving me a hand? [Luke takes the package from Liz.] No, you don't have to do that!"
"LUKE: Yes, I do."
"LIZ: If you insist. [Luke begins to separate the dough and places it on the tray.] I'll, uh, grab me a cup of coffee."
"SOPHIE'S MUSIC SHOP"
"[The band is looking around the shop.]"
"LANE: So, Sophie, you've done, like, big show gigs before playing the piano. Any advice?"
"SOPHIE: Don't wear a clown suit."
"LANE: Thanks."
"Zach [touching a guitar]: Still got my eye on this beauty."
"SOPHIE: Just don't put your hand on it."
"ZACH: Maybe I'll splurge and get it. You take MasterCard?"
"SOPHIE: Why, you got one?"
"ZACH: Just waiting to hear back on the application."
"SOPHIE: Keep moving."
"Zach [sees a wireless headset microphones]: Oh! Cool! We should all get these."
"LANE: Wireless mikes?"
"BRIAN: Isn't that too Gwen Stefani?"
"ZACH: Not if we wear 'em. It'll be totally Peter Gabriel."
"[Brian plays a tune on a piano.]"
"ZACH: Hey, dude. That doesn't sound too bad. What is it?"
"BRIAN: Oh, just a song I've been working on. I don't know if it's any good or not."
"ZACH: Chords are good. Any lyrics?"
"BRIAN: Some. It's called Lane."
"[Lane looks up.]"
"ZACH: It's called Lane?"
"LANE [pleased]: Who, me, Lane?"
"BRIAN: Yeah. We were talking about songs and Lane yesterday and I just got inspired."
"Zach [not pleased]: Inspired, huh?"
"LANE [happy]: That's nice! Thanks, Brian!"
"SOPHIE: Doesn't make me want to be violently ill."
"LANE: High praise."
"BRIAN: Yeah! Thanks, Sophie!"
"LANE [to Zach]: We can learn it next week."
"Zach [getting bothered]: Look, we came to get picks. Let's get picks, okay?"
"[Zach walks away. Lane and Sophie look at each other.]"
"MYSTERY COFFEE SHOP"
"[Christopher is at a table, waiting. As Lorelai enters he stands up.]"
"CHRIS: Lorelai. Over here. I snagged the best table in the house."
"LORELAI: You slip the guy a buck?"
"CHRIS: I had to get my fifty cents change. Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey, Chris. [They hug.]"
"CHRIS [looking at Lorelai]: I don't know how you do it, I mean, you always look -"
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, I get the girls from the Wash & Brush Up company from the Wizard of Oz working for me now."
"CHRIS [chuckles]: Good deal. [They sit down.] So, uh, how's our Rory?"
"LORELAI: Oh, she's good. She's, um, you know. Great. Very busy."
"CHRIS: As per usual."
"LORELAI: She took a little time off Yale."
"CHRIS [pauses]: And the Apocalypse is this week? Next week?"
"LORELAI: She's back there and she's thriving. She'll be running the world one day."
"CHRIS [worried]: You sure?"
"LORELAI: She's doing great. Trust me."
"CHRIS: I do."
"LORELAI: So?"
"CHRIS: So."
"LORELAI: What's going on?"
"CHRIS: Wouldn't you like to know?"
"LORELAI: Christopher."
"CHRIS: This is the funniest thing I've got to do in years. Years! All right? Let me, let me savour it."
"LORELAI: Come on! Tell me. What?"
"CHRIS: My grandfather died."
"LORELAI [puzzled]: Um, that's fun how?"
"CHRIS: Well, that's not the fun part. The old man was ninety eight, long life, great life. His last words were an inappropriate pass at the nurse tending to him. Pretty good one, too. I made a mental note of it."
"LORELAI: So your grandfather died."
"CHRIS: Well, the old guy was actually pretty cool, and for some reason he always liked me. And he was the Hayden with the purse strings. Long story short, I'm rich."
"LORELAI: You're rich!"
"CHRIS: Ridiculously. I mean, I'm not Bill Gates by a long sh*t, but I've got money! Can you stand it?"
"LORELAI [bemused]: Good, Chris. That's good."
"CHRIS: And I want to share it. I've set Gigi up with funds for private nursery school and prep school and college and grad school and post-grad school and Ph.D. school and a wedding and a divorce if she wants it, and another wedding or she can buy a bunch of cats and a lifetime supply of Twizzlers and popcorn if that's her choice. But she's all set, and now I want to take care of you. You and Rory."
"LORELAI [shakes her head]: Oh. Oh, Chris, I don't know what to say."
"CHRIS: What do you want? A car? How about a Bentley? They're pretty sweet. Or a new house? Or a tract of land to build a new house? I can do that. I can buy you a tract."
"LORELAI: Christopher -"
"CHRIS: Or is there someone you hate that you'd like to say 'I can buy and sell you' to? Because you can have the funds to make that happen. You can crush people with money. You want some people-crushing money?"
"LORELAI: Oh, Chris, slow down, here."
"CHRIS: Come on, everybody needs something!"
"LORELAI: Including you. Don't forget yourself."
"CHRIS: Ah, I bought a new bike, I bought a giant audio system. I'm done. What else do I want? Nothing."
"LORELAI: Buy yourself a tract of land."
"CHRIS: Come on. Let me give you something. A castle in Ireland? A Civil w*r cannon. A brewery. Yeah! Buy a brewery! That would be cool! You could brew your own beer!"
"LORELAI: You know, I had a brewery for a while, but I couldn't stand the smell of hops."
"CHRIS: Pay off something. Your house. Outstanding bills. Your bookie. Something. Pay off Yale. Pay off your back taxes."
"LORELAI: I don't owe any back taxes."
"CHRIS: Oh, right, that's me."
"LORELAI: Look, Chris, you're very nice to offer, and I love that you're so excited about it. It's great to see you like this. But I'm fine."
"CHRIS: You're too un-materialistic. You know, I've always thought that."
"LORELAI: If it makes you feel any better, I'll talk to Rory. See if she wants a brewery or a Bentley."
"CHRIS: Or a castle! Don't forget the castle."
"LORELAI [smiles]: I'll mention the castle."
"CHRIS: And it doesn't have to be in Ireland. It can be in Germany, Czech Republic, Scotland, Narnia."
"LORELAI: I'll leave nothing out."
"CHRIS: Okay. So, you hungry?"
"LORELAI: A little."
"CHRIS: Eh, let's eat. [He chuckles.] I'm paying for lunch!"
"SHOWCASE GIG"
"[The band is setting up the equipment, ready for a sound check. Zach is not there yet.]"
"BRIAN: This is the first club I ever went to. I was underage and snuck in and saw Granddaddy in one of their first concerts."
"LANE: Cool."
"GIL: I remember once throwing up in that corner, and some dude slipped in and had to go to the hospital, and I stole the chick he was with and shacked up with her for like a week and a half."
"LANE: Another fun memory."
"GARY [off stage]: How about it, guys? You about ready to do this?"
"LANE: Just a few more minutes, Gary."
"BRIAN: Where's Zach?"
"LANE: I don't know. He's coming separately."
"GIL: Here he is. [Zach comes on stage.] Where you been, man?"
"ZACH: What? Are we punching time cards now?"
"BRIAN: You almost missed sound check!"
"ZACH: Well, almost means I didn't miss it. Just set up your amp, okay?"
"BRIAN: Whatever."
"ZACH: But not there. I'm not liking the setup here."
"GIL: This is how we always set up."
"ZACH: That's why it looks stale. Do you want it to look stale?"
"LANE: No, we don't want that!"
"ZACH: We're going to need room for the new guy, too."
"BRIAN: New guy?"
"LANE: What new guy?"
"ZACH: Hey, Joel! Come over here, buddy. [Joel enters.] This is Joel. He's going to sit in on tambourine."
"JOEL: How you doing?"
"LANE: Good, Joel. Um, we added a new guy?"
"GIL: On tambourine?"
"ZACH: He's going to fill out our sound."
"GIL: But the only reason to have a tambourine is if it's being played by a hot chick. No offense, Joel, but you're not a hot chick."
"ZACH: Yo! Gary! [Holding up the wireless mike.] See this? Remember it. It's mine. I don't want it sucked into the club's gear when I'm not looking."
"GARY: What, the Gwen Stefani mike?"
"ZACH: It's not a Gwen Stefani mike. And don't take it."
"LANE: You bought that mike?"
"ZACH: It means I can crowd surf. The audience loves that."
"JOEL: They do. They love crowd surfing. Dig."
"ZACH: Figure I'll stage side right after our guitar solo."
"LANE: Hey, can I talk to you for a second? [Pulling him to one side.] What is wrong with you?"
"ZACH: Nothing. Why?"
"LANE: You added a band member without telling us?"
"ZACH: Well, it's my band, right?"
"LANE: Uh, no, actually, we're supposed to be a democracy."
"ZACH: Is this coming from Brian?"
"LANE: No, it's coming from me! I'm just - concerned."
"ZACH: Well don't be. And don't be a huge mega bummer before our big show. That's not cool."
"LANE: Okay, I'm sorry."
"[Joel waves the tambourine around, everyone stares at him and Gil turns away.]"

"LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN"
"[Rory is at the table in the kitchen using her laptop, her cell phone rings.]"
"RORY: Hello?"
"PARIS [in the newspaper room at Yale Daily]: Hey, it's me."
"RORY: Who's me?"
"PARIS: Oh my God. You don't recognize your best friend's voice."
"RORY: Sorry, Paris. There's noise here."
"PARIS: So, I'm returning your call."
"RORY: Thanks! I just wanted to tell you something. [Rolling her tongue.] Brrrr! I'm coming back to Yale!"
"PARIS: What was that sound?"
"RORY: That was a drum roll."
"PARIS: You really had to drum roll that? Of course you're coming back. What are you going to do without a college degree? Drive a forklift?"
"RORY: Well, I was calling to ask you if you could keep your eyes and ears open for a place for me to live."
"PARIS: Mid-year like this, it's going to be tough."
"RORY: I'm not picky. Plus I want to come back to the Yale Daily News. That's a given. Where are you right now, by the way?"
"PARIS: I'm here. At the Daily News."
"RORY: By yourself?"
"PARIS: No, everyone's here. I just like a super-quiet atmosphere. No extraneous talking, and I've even had the computer keyboards deadened."
"RORY: So they're getting no break for Thanksgiving?"
"PARIS: I put up a fold-out paper turkey and I laid out some Oscar Meyer."
"[Lorelai enters the kitchen.]"
"RORY: Nice. Well, keep an eye out for a place for me, okay?"
"PARIS: Will do. See you."
"RORY: Thanks. Bye. [To Lorelai] So? No sign of crying or hair being pulled out. The thing with Dad went okay?"
"LORELAI: It was fine. He was telling the truth. There was nothing too horrible. Except for the frings."
"RORY: The what?"
"LORELAI: Oh, the combo basket of fries and onion rings. Good in theory, but -"
"RORY: So what did he want to talk to you about?"
"LORELAI: Well, his grandfather died."
"RORY [understanding]: Oh."
"LORELAI: Apparently it was one of those un-sad deaths. Like Buddy Hackett."
"RORY: No-one was sad about Buddy Hackett?"
"LORELAI: No one I saw on the news. Anyway, he left Chris money. A lot of money. And now he's offering to shower us with it. You want a Bentley?"
"RORY: I don't think so."
"LORELAI: How about a castle?"
"RORY: What would I do with a castle?"
"LORELAI: I'm simply relaying the offer."
"RORY: Dad should keep the money for himself."
"LORELAI: Are you sure there's nothing you want? A brewery, a Faberge egg, or let's see, what else did he mention? Um, paying for Yale through a Ph.D., uh, vacations, a cannon from the Civil w*r - functioning, by the way, so it's not just show. It seemed like the sky was the limit, although he didn't mention the Hoover Dam, so maybe there is a cap of some sort."
"RORY: Actually, I think maybe there is something I'd want."
"LORELAI: Really? Okay, what?"
"RORY: I would maybe let him pay for Yale."
"LORELAI: Seriously?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"RORY: Unless it's too much."
"LORELAI: I think it was the cheapest of all the things he mentioned."
"RORY: It's just that there would be residual benefits. It would get me out from under Grandma and Grandpa's thumb, which sounds really good to me right now."
"LORELAI: Well. I can't say I don't relate."
"RORY: I don't want them to be holding anything over my head. I don't want to owe them anything. There's too much pressure. Too much expected. There are too many strings with these people."
"LORELAI [holds up her hands to stop her]: Okay. I'm getting very uncomfortable with the Freaky Friday moment we've got going on here, 'cause it means I have to go to Yale, you have to run the inn, and oh, God, I don't even like thinking about what it would mean for Luke."
"RORY: It's feeling better by the second, this idea."
"LORELAI: You do understand, you'd basically be cutting Mom and Dad off."
"RORY: You don't know what it was like to be living there."
"LORELAI [insulted]: Hello, oppressed one, class of eighty-five!"
"RORY: But you got out."
"LORELAI: No, no. You were only there for three months. You're not in my league. We can't swap w*r stories yet."
"RORY: They had their Reverend come over to talk me out of having sex. They never did that to you."
"LORELAI: Five times they did that to me! The last time they triple-teamed me with a priest, a rabbi and a Mormon missionary. I made so many jokes that night, I should have had a microphone and a brick wall behind me. And I never got a forty thousand dollar sex house."
"RORY [frowns]: A what?"
"LORELAI: You don't want to know."
"RORY: Look. I know it's a slippery slope. Dad is Dad."
"LORELAI: Yes, he is."
"RORY: But I'm pretty sure I want to do this."
"LORELAI: Well, if you're sure, you're sure. We'll call him."
"RORY: We'll call him."
"LORELAI: He's going to be happy!"
"RORY: Not as happy as me."
"LORELAI: Good."
"[Lorelai get up and pats her head.]"
"SHOWCASE GIG"
"[Rory is at a table, people are gathering for the show. Lane comes up to Rory's table.]"
"LANE: Hey. Hey!"
"RORY [standing up]: Wow! You look almost intimidatingly cool."
"LANE: Thanks."
"RORY: Everyone ready?"
"LANE: Pretty much, although sound check was a little weird."
"RORY: Well, you know what they say. Weird sound check, good gig."
"LANE [nodding]: Who says that?"
"RORY: Well, just me. But I'm hoping it'll catch on."
"LANE: See those two guys? Those are the label guys."
"RORY: Oh. I'll be careful not to hurt them when I start violently slam-dancing. You're going to be great."
"LANE: Thanks. I should get back there. We have this pre-show thing we always do."
"RORY: Good luck! [She sits down and Lane goes backstage.]"
"BACKSTAGE"
"[The band is doing it final tuning for the show which is about to start. Zach is checking his wireless microphone.]"
"ZACH: Test. Test. Test. [angry.] Monitor check! Monitor check! Test! Test! Test! Test! Where'd they get these monitors, the Kremlin? Test! Test!"
"GIL: It's your wireless mic, dude. It's not working."
"ZACH: Well, did somebody touch it? Because it was working before."
"LANE [entering]: One minute, guys."
"ZACH: Who says one minute? We go on when we go on! No-one tells Axl Rose when he goes on, he goes on when he feels like it."
"BRIAN: You're comparing yourself to Axl Rose?"
"ZACH: Don't get in my face, Brian."
"BRIAN: I'm not."
"ZACH: Go write some more songs if you've got a problem."
"ANNOUNCER [OS]: All right! Welcome to the New Deck!"
"Zach [balling up a piece of paper and it throwing away]: Listen, we're throwing out the set list."
"LANE: What?"
"ZACH: Keep up. I'm going to be calling out tunes like Jack White."
"BRIAN: But we rehearsed in this order. We've got transitions."
"ZACH: Yeah! REO Speedwagon had transitions, too! You want to be REO Speedwagon? We should have brought the smoke machine!"
"ANNOUNCER: We've got a special showcase for you tonight. Give it up for Connecticut's own Hep Alien!"
"LANE: Wait, wait, we didn't do our lucky pre-show thing!"
"[The stage curtain opens up.]"
"GIL: Lane, count it down!"
"BRIAN: What are we playing?"
"LANE: Yeah, what are we playing?"
"ZACH: Check, one, two, check, check!"
"GIL: Dude, what are we playing?"
"ZACH: I need to be hotter in the monitor, Gary! Wake up, dude!"
"BRIAN: Come on, let's start!"
"JOEL: Hey, I know that guy."
"ZACH: We'll start when I'm ready. This is my stage."
"GIL: Come on, let's do Rebecca."
"Zach [into the mic]: Just hang on, it's worth waiting around to see the band that's going to get the biggest record deal in history."
"[The audience begins calling out 'Play!' and booing.]"
"GIL: This is pathetic."
"MAN IM AUDIENCE: You guys suck!"
"WOMAN IN AUDIENCE: Freebird!"
"[Brian takes a step toward Zach.]"
"ZACH: Hey! Knock it off."
"BRIAN: Knock what off?"
"ZACH: You know what you're doing! Get back to your mike. [He kicks toward Brian.] Get back!"
"LANE [disgusted]: Zach!"
"GIL: Don't kick him."
"ZACH: Get off my stage if you've got a problem! Nobody's going to tell me what to do on my stage with my band!"
"GIL [to Joel]: Dude, you need to find another place to stand. I'm not going to tell you again."
"BRIAN: If he moves, he's going to block Lane."
"ZACH: Oh, yeah, you don't want Lane blocked, do you?"
"MAN IN AUDIENCE: Come on!"
"ZACH: This is a song called Stella."
"LANE: We haven't learned that song!"
"BRIAN: Let's go back to the set list!"
"Zach [takes off his guitar]: No, we're not going to do that. I'm here to destroy the system so stay out of my way! [He kicks toward Brian again.]"
"GIL: Hey!"
"ZACH: And you don't need to -"
"[A fight breaks out, Gil jumps on Zach. Brian and Lane try to break up the fight. The crown starts throwing things and booing. Rory is still filming them and jumps back. The crowd cheers as the curtain closes.]"
"OUTSIDE THE CLUB - BACK DOOR"
"[Zach is sitting on the step outside the club, pouting when Lane comes outside, she looks mad.]"
"ZACH: Dude broke my wireless mike."
"LANE: Zach. What is wrong with you?"
"ZACH: Nothing."
"LANE: Nothing! This was a disaster. The guys from the label were there! They showed up! It was our sh*t! We worked so hard to get to this point, and we blew our big sh*t! [Almost crying] What the hell is wrong with you? [Zach shrugs.] You let me down tonight. You let down Gil, you let down Brian -"
"ZACH: I don't want to hear about Brian!"
"LANE [pleading]: Zach!"
"ZACH: This is what it is, okay? Maybe this is why people in bands shouldn't date."
"LANE [shocked]: Yeah. [She starts crying and nods.] I guess so."
"[Lane goes back inside leaving Zach who hangs his head.]"
"MYSTERY COFFEE SHOP"
"[Lorelai and Rory enter as Chris gets up.]"
"CHRIS: Hey, guys!"
"LORELAI: Happy Thanksgiving!"
"RORY: Hey, Dad!"
"[Chris kisses Rory on the cheek as they hug.]"
"CHRIS: God, I've missed you! Have you grown? She's grown!"
"LORELAI: Only in my estimation."
"CHRIS: I, I cannot tell you how jazzed I am to see you on Thanksgiving! You know, we've never seen each other on Thanksgiving."
"LORELAI: Oh, God, is that true?"
"RORY: I think so."
"CHRIS: I know so. So, uh, what's this about?"
"LORELAI: I filled Rory in. I mentioned the brewery, and the castle."
"CHRIS: The Oompa Loompas?"
"LORELAI: Those too. And, um - well, you want to take it?"
"RORY: Dad, I - I thought about it, and Mom and I talked about it, and I think it would be really great if you could pay for Yale."
"CHRIS [happy]: Absolutely, absolutely! Nothing would make me happier."
"RORY: Good. Thank you."
"CHRIS: I am there, I am so there."
"LORELAI: That's great."
"CHRIS: Let me pay for Chilton too."
"LORELAI: Well, that's already taken care of."
"RORY: You know, Yale's kind of expensive."
"CHRIS: But I'm loaded - didn't you tell her? I'm loaded!"
"LORELAI: I told her."
"CHRIS: So, how do I do this? Do I give you the cash, or do I pay Yale? Do they take checks or does it have to be a money order? What is a money order anyway? I mean, how is it different from a check? Isn't a check a piece of paper forwarding money? What's the difference?"
"LORELAI: Whoa, Chris, slow down."
"CHRIS: This makes me so happy, I can't tell you, Rory."
"RORY: It means a lot to me, Dad. This was excellent timing, believe me."
"CHRIS: Well, it means more to me."
"[Rory's cell phone rings, she looks at the Caller ID.]"
"RORY: This is the paper in Stamford. Excuse me."
"CHRIS: Hey, try to steal a pie on the way out."
"RORY: Okay. [She goes outside to answer the call.]"
"CHRIS: Thanks for making this happen, Lor."
"LORELAI: Hey, it wasn't me. It's what she wanted."
"CHRIS: Well, thanks for giving her the choice."
"LORELAI: My pleasure."
"CHRIS: So can I ask you something?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"CHRIS: It involves the E word and the R word."
"LORELAI: Please, let's not discuss evolution or recycling. They're just too hot-button."
"CHRIS: Weren't Emily and Richard paying for Yale?"
"LORELAI: Yes, they were."
"CHRIS: Something going on there?"
"LORELAI: Everything's fine."
"CHRIS: Why'd she take time off? What happened there?"
"LORELAI: It's - it's a long story. Listen, Chris, just so we're clear -"
"CHRIS: We're clear. I'm providing. That's it. I'm just doing what I should have done years ago."
"LORELAI: Good."
"CHRIS: And it will remain good. Honest."
"LORELAI [satisfied]: Okay."
"CHRIS [reluctantly]: So how long have you been engaged?"
"LORELAI [sighs]: Who told you?"
"CHRIS [laughing]: Your finger."
"LORELAI: Oh. [She looks down at the ring.] Blabbermouth."
"CHRIS: It's a good thing. I want you happy, I always have."
"LORELAI: I know, thank you."
"CHRIS: But, this isn't going to be a weird thing with you and him, is it? My paying for Yale."
"LORELAI: No, it's not going to be."
"CHRIS: Well, cool. You're getting a Rolls for a wedding present, you know."
"LORELAI: Cool, I should register for a driver to go with it."
"CHRIS: Well, yeah, they're too big to drive by yourself."
"LORELAI: No, God, you've got to have somebody drive you."
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Luke show some customers out.]"
"LUKE: Bye, now. Have a nice - [Hearing a crash in the kitchen.] - Thanksgiving. Huh? [He goes to the kitchen see what happened. Liz comes out with a tray of burnt food.]"
"LIZ: My rolls exploded!"
"LUKE: What do you mean, they exploded?"
"LIZ: They turned black and they exploded!"
"LUKE: Well, clean them up. I'm not going to -"
"LIZ: My turkey! [She puts the tray down to run upstairs.]"
"LUKE: Liz? [Luke follows after her.]"
"LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Liz enters the apartment with Luke right behind.]"
"LIZ: Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
"LUKE [looking at the mess]: It's like Motley Crue's been here."
"LIZ [looks in to the oven]: Good, that red button thingy hasn't popped up yet."
"LUKE: Look, you're way over-cooking your stuffing, here. [He turns down the burner.]"
"LIZ: Hey, how do you turn on your oven light? Never mind, I'll check my Martha."
"LUKE: How to turn on my oven light is not going to be in your Martha Stewart book."
"LIZ [sits down and opens her cook book]: Hey, that red pop-up thingy. Are turkeys born with that or is that something they put in?"
"LUKE: I don't know, why don't you ask Martha?"
"LIZ: Oh, she knows. She knows everything."
"LUKE [looks into a pot]: Hey, you're going to have to get some canned cranberry sauce. Your homemade - well, it's not red. It should be red."
"LIZ: I know, I don't know how that happened."
"LUKE: Well, everything seems kind of under control here."
"LIZ: Thanks, Luke. I'm so sorry, TJ thought the microwave was working but I guess not."
"LUKE [nodding]: It's okay. [He stares at the floor for a minute, then takes a deep breath and looks at Liz.] Liz -"
"LIZ: Look at Martha's hands! They're so white!"
"LUKE [seriously]: Liz, you got a minute?"
"LIZ: Yeah, big brother, I got a minute."
"[She closes the book as he sits down at the table.]"
"LUKE [sighs as he presses his hands to his mouth]: Um, this is hard, I - I feel like this giant weight's been sitting on me, I just - I just need someone to talk to."
"LIZ [frowns, then shrugs]: Well, then talk."
"LUKE: I've got a kid."
"LIZ [shocked, but happy]: A kid? You've got a kid?"
"LUKE: A girl. A little girl. She's twelve. I am her father."
"LIZ: Oh, boy, oh boy!"
"LUKE: She came to the diner out of the blue and she was testing to see who her father was. Not for money or anything, it was for this science fair she was in. She's smart."
"LIZ [cheerfully]: Oh, boy, oh, boy!"
"LUKE: So I went down to the fair and there she was. You know, and there I was. My picture, the DNA test. [laughing nervously.] She's mine."
"LIZ: Twelve, huh?"
"LUKE: Twelve."
"LIZ: That's Anna Nardini, isn't it?"
"LUKE [stunned]: How'd you know?"
"LIZ: Luke, you're not Warren b*at. I mean, you could have been, girls like you, but you're a serial monogamist. That's why you're you. I remember Anna, I liked her!"
"LUKE: I don't know what to do. I'm just so confused."
"LIZ: Well, what did Lorelai say? [Luke looks down.] You haven't told her."
"LUKE: We're engaged, we're on track here, her and me. And Rory's back, so that's settled now. We're in a good place! You know, this could wreck it."
"LIZ: It won't wreck it. Not unless you let it."
"LUKE: She's been out there twelve years, this little girl!"
"LIZ: What does Anna want from you?"
"LUKE: That's the thing. Nothing. She hasn't contacted me. I mean, why hasn't she? She could have called me. What? Does she think I'd be a b*at?"
"LIZ: Oh! No one would think that."
"LUKE: April doesn't want anything either. That's her name. April. You know, it's all just very scientific with her. I couldn't even get her to go for ice cream with me."
"LIZ: Whoa. [thinking] Did you offer cake?"
"LUKE [puzzled]: No."
"LIZ: Maybe she wanted cake. Or pie. You offer pie?"
"LUKE: No."
"LIZ: Maybe she wanted pie. Or fudge."
"LUKE: It's not about what I offered her, Liz. She didn't have any interest. You know, that's the thing. Why should I feel burdened? I mean, they're not reaching out. Neither one of them. So why should I?"
"LIZ [shaks her head]: I don't know -"
"LUKE: I mean, the girl's got her life. She seems very adjusted, a little weird, but thriving. Anna's got her life, I've got my life, you know. I shouldn't worry about this. I mean, why should I? There's no reason to."
"LIZ: I guess not."
"LUKE: Good. Good. [He sighs and is relieved.] I'm not going to worry. I'm going to let it go. [smiles.] Yeah, this has been good. Thanks for listening, Liz. I feel better. [Liz nods.] Well, you should get back to your food, there. This is settled."
"LIZ: Okay."
"LUKE: All right. There's your Martha. [He pushes the cook book to her.]"
"LIZ: Thanks."
"[Luke gets up and leaves, pats Liz on the head as he goes by. Liz watches Luke leave the room.]"
"DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN"
"[Sookie is happy as she gets a third turkey out of the oven and puts in on the counter with other two.]"
"LORELAI [entering]: Everyone's here, everyone's hungry!"
"SOOKIE: Perfect timing, 'cause Tree, Chuck and Bob here are ready to be consumed."
"LORELAI: Please, don't name the food we eat."
"SOOKIE: Sorry."
"LORELAI: So are you ready to carve? [She picks up a fork and pokes 'Chuck'.]"
"SOOKIE: We're ready to carve. I could use some help, though. Maybe send Luke in. [She slaps Lorelai's on the hand.]"
"LORELAI: He loves to carve."
"SOOKIE: There's enough food, right? Did I make enough food?"
"LORELAI: There's plenty, even considering the extra guests."
"SOOKIE: Good. Go tell them it'll be five minutes."
"LORELAI: Will do."
"DINING ROOM"
"[Luke and Rory are at the table next to one another. Stu from the Renaissance Faire is next to Luke and is playing a stabling game with a knife and his fingers, There is a cheer at the table when he finishes]"
"LIZ: Huzzah! You're so good at that, Stu! Really. Too bad you didn't put all that effort into something you can make money at."
"STU: Thanks, Liz. [To Luke] So, when are you coming back out on the Renaissance Faire circuit with us, Luke?"
"LUKE: I think sometime after I'm drugged and lobotomized."
"[Everyone laughs.]"
"STU: You're the funniest, smartest guy I know, Luke."
"LIZ: I'm calling him Yakov from now on."
"LUKE [to Rory]: Please don't judge me by this."
"RORY: I won't. Yakov."
"LORELAI [entering]: We're just minutes away from eating, everybody!"
"LIZ: Oh, I can't wait to see this meal! My dinner didn't turn out like Martha's picture. Who knew a turkey could melt like that? I didn't."
"LORELAI [to Rory and Luke]: Hey, guys, when'd you sneak in?"
"LUKE: Oh, just a couple minutes ago."
"LORELAI: How'd you like to carve for us?"
"LUKE: I'll carve if you want."
"LORELAI: Bless you. Um, let me talk to you over here for a second first."
"LUKE: Oh, okay."
"[They go in to the next room.]"
"LORELAI: So."
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"LORELAI: Um. That Christopher call from before, the famous one?"
"LUKE: The infamous one."
"LORELAI: Oh, you remember that?"
"LUKE: I remember it."
"LORELAI: Well, I never filled you in on the content. He said he wanted to talk and he said it was important, so I met up with him."
"LUKE: Oh, yeah?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. He's come into a lot of money, family money. And he offered Rory and me lots of things we didn't want or need, but Rory took him up on his offer to pay for Yale. It was her idea and I support it. That's it. So he's going to be financing her tuition this year and next year and, um, we got together today at a diner to finalize it, and that's it."
"LUKE [shrugs]: I think that's great."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Yes. I think that's absolutely great."
"LORELAI: You heard the part about how I got together with Christopher?"
"LUKE: Absolutely. You had to, to talk about this. He's her dad. He's her dad. If he's got something, he should be sharing it, good for him. He's been gone most of the time, so he owes you. I'm glad he's doing it. He's doing what a dad is supposed to do. He's taking care of his kid. Good. Good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, good. So you're good with this."
"LUKE: I am."
"LORELAI: And so we're good."
"LUKE: We're great."
"LORELAI: Thank you for understanding."
"[They kiss.]"
"LUKE: I'm going to go carve."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"DINING ROOM"
"[Liz walks by the table and see Rory.]"
"LIZ: Oh, Rory, have you met Freddy? He has no thumbs."
"RORY: No, I haven't. Hi, Freddy. [She goes to shake his.]"
"FREDDY: Hi! [As he extends his hand Rory's phone rings. She looks at his hand with no thumb.]"
"RORY: Excuse me. [She goes into the library and answers her phone.] Hello?"
"HONOR: Rory, hi! It's Honor Huntzberger."
"RORY: Oh, hi, Honor. How are you doing?"
"[The scene cuts between Rory and Honor who is outdoors and pacing back and forth, smoking and with a drink in her hand.]"
"HONOR: I've been exiled. My parent's house is eleven thousand square feet and smoking is banned from every nook and cranny of it. Only because Mom stopped smoking again. So, here I am, freezing my ass off."
"RORY: Bummer."
"HONOR: So, I thought I'd call and tell you what a drag it is, this thing with you and Logan."
"RORY: Oh, yeah?"
"HONOR: When Logan said you two broke up, I almost threw a lamp at him."
"RORY [shocked]: Oh."
"HONOR [unaware]: Moron. He's his own worst enemy."
"RORY: He told you that we broke up?"
"HONOR: Well, I was wondering where you were for Thanksgiving, and at first young Seacrest hemmed and hawed, which wasn't sufficient, so he finally told me. Idiot. Him, not you."
"RORY: Right."
"HONOR: I'm so sorry. But you and I can still go shopping, you know. Bergdorf's is calling."
"RORY: Yeah. Sure."
"HONOR: Good. Well, I have to get back inside before I turn into an ice cube. Are you at least having a nice Thanksgiving?"
"RORY: Yeah. It's really nice."
"HONOR: I'll be in touch."
"RORY: Sure. Thanks, Honor."
"HONOR: Bye."
"RORY: Bye. [She hangs up the cell phone.]"
"KITCHEN"
"[Sookie's is watching Luke closely as he tries to carve one of the turkeys.]"
"SOOKIE: Okay, that's too thin, too thin!"
"LUKE: I'm just getting started, give me some room."
"SOOKIE: Okay, that's too thick, too thick, too thick!"
"LUKE: Hang on, Sookie. [Taping the knife on the turkey.]"

"MACHINE'S VOICE: Press one to be connected to area code -"
"[Luke presses one and the phone start to ring, an answering machine picks up.]"
"APRIL'S VOICE [on the machine]: Hello. You've reached the Nardini residence. We're not home, or else we're too distracted to answer right now, so -"
"[Luke hangs up in a rush, he sighs and looks at the phone for a minute. He leaves and goes back to the dining table and sits down between Liz and Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: She kick you out?"
"LUKE: What? Who?"
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"LUKE: Oh, yeah."
"LORELAI: Predictable."
"LUKE: Yeah, predictable."
"[Rory comes from her phone call, not too happy either.]"
"LORELAI: Hey! You okay?"
"RORY [quietly]: Kind of."
"LORELAI: You sure?"
"RORY [half-smiles at her]: I'm just hungry."
"SOOKIE [entering]: Dinner is served!"
"[The food starts to come out. Both Rory and Luke looking sad, sit quietly as everyone starts to chatter and eat. Paul Anka's song ""Eye of the Tiger"" starts to play at the screen fades to black.]"

"(OPEN in Luke's diner, morning. The place is busy but not too much. Kirk is sitting at a table. Suddenly he gets up, goes behind the counter, gets the coffee pot goes back to his table fills up his cup and then goes behind the counter again to put the coffee pot in it's place. Luke watches him.)"
"LUKE: What in the hell do you think you're doing?"
"KIRK: I was just getting some coffee."
"LUKE: You came behind my counter."
"KIRK: I saw Lorelai do it the other day."
"LUKE: Lorelai is my fiance."
"KIRK: So only people you're sleeping with are allowed to go behind the counter?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"KIRK: Well...I don't really know you that well, Luke. I mean, I know what you do for a living, and I know you're a Scorpio, and you smell OK, but we've never really connected on a deeper level..."
"LUKE: Get out from behind my counter, Kirk."
"KIRK: Well, now it's a definite ""no"". (goes back to his table as Lorelai and Rory enter the diner holding some bags)"
"LORELAI: Oh, my God. Look who's back."
"RORY: Well, I believe it's those adorable Gilmore Girls."
"LORELAI: My, how we have missed them."
"RORY: I hear they're different now. (Luke comes up to them) A little sad."
"LORELAI: A little broke."
"LUKE: Don't you two believe in jet lag?"
"LORELAI: No way. We're still flying on the Atlantic City buzz. Hey, (they kiss) handsome. Were you bad while I was gone?"
"LUKE: I was. I went to bed every night at 10:15."
"LORELAI: Grandpa! what am I gonna do with you?"
"RORY: Hey, Luke. (they hug)"
"LUKE: Hey, Rory. (they all start walking over to a table to sit)"
"LORELAI: We, on the other hand, have not been to bed at all since we left."
"RORY: We did fall over once, though."
"LUKE: Did you have a good trip?"
"RORY: I believe it was the best belated 21st-birthday party on record. (they sit, and Lorelai sips some coffee, that the Asian looking waiter who's always in the background brought over)"
"LORELAI: What's different?"
"RORY: No kalua."
"LORELAI: Oh, right. Which reminds me. (to Luke) Sorry about all the drunken late-night phone calls."
"LUKE: What drunken late-night phone calls?"
"LORELAI: Uh, so, um, do you want to hear about all the things we can tell you about our trip?"
"LUKE: I'm not sure."
"LORELAI: OK, well first of all, video poker is my calling. (Luke goes over to sit on one of the chairs at the girls? table) I think I'm totally gonna dedicate my life to it. Especially the third machine in the second row of machines as you hit the entrance of Trump Taj Mahal."
"RORY: I'm more of a roulette girl myself."
"LORELAI: And we did the whole thing up right, you know. We did the martinis at the blackjack table."
"RORY: And we pretended I was turning 21 while we were playing 21."
"LORELAI: And we actually won and bought our 21 items."
"RORY: sh*t glasses, glow-in-the-dark coasters, salt and pepper shakers, pasties."
"LORELAI: Oh, and look. (gets out a piece of paper and hands it over to Luke)"
"LUKE: What's that?"
"RORY: 21 guys' phone numbers."
"LORELAI: I must say I'm pretty proud of how quickly we got them and also of the fact that no one questioned us when we said our names were Wendy and Lisa."
"LUKE: Uh, huh. So, tell me, how was Paul Anka, the person, not the dog?"
"LORELAI: We didn't get to see him."
"LUKE: Why not? It's all you talked about."
"RORY: The billboard was old and his show had actually closed a week before we got there."
"LUKE: So, who'd you end up seeing?"
"LORELAI: Well, it came down to Journey without their original lead singer, INXS without their original lead singer, Queen without their original lead singer, the Supremes without Diana, and, weirdly, the James Brown band without James Brown."
"RORY: But we wound up seeing Tony Danza, who was sublime."
"LORELAI: Oh, the tap dancing."
"RORY: Why ""Taxi"" never utilized his musical-comedy k*ll is astonishing."
"LUKE: Sounds great."
"LORELAI: Oh, and we snagged you a Paul Anka T-shirt. (gets the T-shirt out to show Luke)"
"RORY: Had some left over."
"LORELAI: (in a fake seductive tone) Wear it tonight."
"LUKE: (takes the T-shirt) OK. I'm making you burgers. (about to get up)"
"LORELAI: Wait, wait. You haven't seen the best part yet."
"LUKE: What?"
"RORY: Oh! We were walking..."
"LORELAI: Well, sort of walking, sort of drunk girls in high heels stumbling."
"RORY: ...down the street, and we see this guy."
"LORELAI: And, Luke, my hand to God, it's you. (Luke seems surprised)"
"RORY: It's totally you. Luke 2.0."
"LORELAI: We came face-to-face with your doppelganger, my friend."
"RORY: So we followed him."
"LORELAI: Yeah, 'cause we had to. And he went into this nightclub, so we followed him."
"RORY: 'Cause we're now stalkers obsessed with getting his picture."
"LORELAI: So we follow him through this kinda grungy place. And he goes backstage."
"RORY: 'Cause he's in the biz."
"LORELAI: Yeah. So we sneak behind the curtain, and we track him down. And we told him all about you, and then I showed him your picture, and he totally freaked out."
"RORY: Wait I got it. (takes a picture out of a bag and hands it to Luke. He takes it and looks at it)"
"LORELAI: Luke, I want you to meet Derek McKinney, your twin separated at birth."
"LUKE: (shows them the picture) This is a man dressed like Dolly Parton."
"RORY: You should hear him do ""Jolene"". Amazing."
"LUKE: You think I look like a guy dressed as Dolly Parton?"
"LORELAI: No, I mean a little less with the makeup, but check out the chins. (start pointing from Luke to the picture)"
"LUKE: I'm gonna get your burgers. (gets up and goes to the kitchen)"
"LORELAI: He missed us."
"RORY: Definitely."
"(OPENING CREDITS)"
"(CUT to outside Lorelai's house, morning. Rory is waiting in front of her car, which is full of her stuff)"
"RORY: Mom, I got to go!"
"LORELAI: (comes out of the house and runs over to Rory holding a paper bag) Hold on. Wait. I'm coming. Here's sustenance for the road."
"RORY: For the very long thirty-minute drive back to school? (takes the bag and walks over to the car) Thank god. I don't think I would have made it. (opens the car door to put the bag in)"
"LORELAI: Do you have everything?"
"RORY: I think so. (gasps) Oh, no! (starts to throe out of the car a bunch of boxes)"
"LORELAI: What? What are you doing? Why do you hate the boxes?"
"RORY: Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! (takes out her Community Service vest) I accidentally forgot to turn in my community-service vest."
"LORELAI: So?"
"RORY: So? This vest belongs to the state. I have now stolen state property. They're gonna give me community service for stealing my community-service vest."
"LORELAI: OK freaky link. Hand me the vest. I will personally deliver it to the state. OK? What's next on your agenda?"
"RORY: I'm just gonna head straight over to Paris' apartment."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you're gonna live with Paris again...again."
"RORY: Hey, she's got an empty room, and the price is right. And all the housing on campus is taken, so it's that or a cardboard box."
"LORELAI: OK, but how big a cardboard box?"
"RORY: After I dump my stuff at Paris's, I have to hit campus. I still have some class begging to do. I have to add two courses to my schedule if I'm gonna make up all the work I've missed this year."
"LORELAI: You don't have to make up everything right away."
"RORY: I do if I want to graduate the same time I would have before the detour. Anyway, I have tons of books to buy. I have a meeting with the Dean. Oh, and, of course, I have a meeting with the school psychologist."
"LORELAI: Oh, uh. Back up. I'm sorry. You... A meeting with who?"
"RORY: I told you about this."
"LORELAI: No, you did not."
"RORY: Every student who unexpectedly takes time off and wants to come back has to have a one-time meeting with the school psychologist."
"LORELAI: You did not tell me this."
"RORY: I did too."
"LORELAI: No you did not, because I would have remembered if you told me you had to have your head shrunk."
"RORY: It's just a formality. They just want to make sure I'm stable and that everything's cool."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you're going to a therapist. You know they're totally gonna ask you about me."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: They always want to ask about your mother. It's OK. Say whatever you want. But make sure you start with, ""My mother's very hot""..."
"RORY: Yes, that won't seem at all disturbing to the doctor. I have to get going. (picks up the boxes she threw out and puts them back in the car)"
"LORELAI: I don't want you to go."
"RORY: Mum!"
"LORELAI: No! You just got here."
"RORY: But you're gonna come see me in three days."
"LORELAI: I know, but with our stupid fight, I got cheated this year. (they start walking over to the drivers door)"
"RORY: I know. Me too."
"LORELAI: OK. (they hug) All right. That's enough affection for you. Paul Anka, come say goodbye."
"RORY: I haven't seen him all morning."
"LORELAI: Paul Anka! Oh, well, I guess he doesn't like you better than me."
"RORY: A fickle pooch, that one."
"LORELAI: Well, he knows who pours the kibble. (points to herself)"
"RORY: Well say goodbye to him for me, and I'll call you tonight."
"LORELAI: OK. Bye. (they kiss goodbye and Lorelai notices something in the car) Hey!"
"RORY: What? (turns around to look. It's PA) He does like me better!"
"LORELAI: Oh, you put bacon in your laundry."
"RORY: Paul Anka likes me better. Paul Anka likes me better."
"LORELAI: First Tony Danza tosses you the corsage, and now this. (Rory opens the car door, and PA comes out) Get out here, you. Yeah. That's right. Avoid my glance there, buddy."
"RORY: It's the sugar-on-the-toe thing. A dog never forgets his first sugar toe."
"LORELAI: I thought you had a million things to do today."
"RORY: Hmm. Suddenly not so sad to see me go, huh?"
"LORELAI: What? No. Don't be a stranger. Bye-bye. (start to sorta push her in the car)"
"RORY: Bye, Paul Anka. If you squint really hard, she kind of looks like me."
"LORELAI: Take off, lady. (Rory gets in the car and starts to drive away. Lorelai waves and PA gets up starts barking and following the car as Rory drives off) Hey, Judas, get back here right now! (runs after PA)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Lane is walking around serving coffee. Lorelai and Sookie are sitting at a table and have some paper, magazines and brochures in front of them)"
"SOOKIE: So, what are your initial thoughts about your wedding?"
"LORELAI: Well...it should be legal."
"SOOKIE: Good. OK. And after that?"
"LORELAI: After that, I'm out."
"SOOKIE: Oh! How about a hometown wedding? Town square, ceremony in the gazebo."
"LORELAI: Gaze-blah."
"SOOKIE: OK. Boring. I got it. How about a church wedding?"
"LORELAI: Maybe."
"SOOKIE: Ooh, a beach wedding, huh? No shoes, Luke can wear shorts."
"LORELAI: No. But I want to be with you when you pitch the shorts idea to Luke."
"SOOKIE: OK, no consensus on the locale. Let's move on to the dress."
"LORELAI: OK"
"SOOKIE: Any thoughts?"
"LORELAI: There should be one."
"SOOKIE: OK. Doing great here. (Luke comes up to their table)"
"LUKE: Um, are you gonna eat that cake?"
"LORELAI: Why, you want it?"
"LUKE: Well, it's just sitting there. It doesn't look like you're gonna eat it."
"LORELAI: Oh, my god. You want our table don't you?"
"LUKE: Yeah, we're swamped."
"LORELAI: Luke, I'm your fiance. That doesn't buy me a little extra table time?"
"LUKE: You've been sitting there for two hours."
"LORELAI: We're planning our wedding."
"LUKE: Well, plan it at the counter."
"LORELAI: You want a counter-planned wedding, seriously?"
"LUKE: (calling back at the kitchen) Coming right up. (back at Lorelai) Forget I said anything."
"LORELAI: Yeah. (Luke walks away)"
"SOOKIE: (looking at a magazine) Hey, that's a pretty dress."
"LORELAI: Hum...Maybe. It's very white."
"SOOKIE: You don't want to wear white?"
"LORELAI: Uh, maybe. I'm not sure. (Luke comes back up to the table)"
"LUKE: Of course you're gonna wear white. Brides wear white. That's the rule."
"LORELAI: Says who?"
"LUKE: Well, uh, you have to wear white. My mother wore white. Her mother wore white."
"SOOKIE: Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke! Do you know who I am?"
"LUKE: Of course I know who you are."
"SOOKIE: Who am I, Luke?"
"LUKE: You're Sookie."
"SOOKIE: No, Luke. I'm not ""Sookie."" I'm ""Sookie B-F-O-T-B""."
"LUKE: What?"
"SOOKIE: Best Friend Of The Bride. It is my responsibility to help plan this event. To talk through all the details, to taste the cake and pick the invitations, and to keep you, the fiance of the bride, from having to pretend to be interested in things that he has no interest in."
"LUKE: I have an int...!"
"SOOKIE: No you don't!"
"LUKE: I have an interest!"
"SOOKIE: B-F-O-T-B."
"LUKE: But I'm not...!"
"SOOKIE: AaaHhh!"
"LANE: Luke, your turkey melt is up."
"SOOKIE: Oh! Luke, your turkey melt's up."
"LUKE: Fine. (walks away)"
"LANE: Refills?"
"LORELAI: Yes. See, I can make decisions. (Lane starts to our coffee)"
"LANE: What's all this?"
"SOOKIE: We are planning a wedding."
"LANE: Oh, super. Well, at least there'll be cake. (walks away)"
"LORELAI: Well, it's nice that my outlook on life is sunnier than a 21-year-old'S."
"SOOKIE: OK, let's start with something simple. A date for the wedding."
"LORELAI: OK, that does sound simple."
"SOOKIE: Now, some people have mentioned some conflicts, and I think we should take those into consideration."
"LORELAI: OK"
"SOOKIE: Miss Patty is going to be in Baja the first two weeks in April. And Babette said the last two weeks in April are bad because her cat's expecting kittens."
"LORELAI: That little tramp."
"SOOKIE: Michel's bad every Saturday from now until February, because he signed up for his booty boot camp again. Kirk has no conflicts, but Lulu is going to Florida sometime between May 15th and June 1st. (Luke overhearing comes back up to their table)"
"LUKE: Yes...who's Lulu?"
"LORELAI: Kirk's girlfriend."
"LUKE: Yeah, we're not moving wedding plans around for people whose last names I don't even know."
"SOOKIE: Luke!"
"LUKE: WHAT!?"
"SOOKIE: Who am I?"
"LUKE: Aw, geez. (walks away)"
"(CUT to outside Paris and Doyle's apartment. Paris and Rory, who is carrying some bags, come up the staircase as Paris is giving her a tour)"
"PARIS: Apartment 5 is Mrs.Holiday. She steals mail. Apartment 6 is the chilli cheese boys. Take the description at face value. I don't know who's in apartment 7 because meeting 5 and 6 was enough ""it takes a village"" for me. Here we are, apartment 8. (walks to the apartment door)"
"RORY: 8 is great. (follows Paris)"
"PARIS: OK, now, you have to unlock the middle bolt first...the bottom bolt second...the top lock third...the bottom lock fourth. You got to kick the door twice. And that's it. (explains while demonstrating)"
"RORY: Wow, you really have to earn it, huh?"
"PARIS: It's just a precaution. It isn't really necessary. This neighborhood is only as scary as you make it. Those guys downstairs, they just look deadly. Believe me, they don't bother you if you don't bother them. When you have guests over, just tell them they're a Doo-Wop group."
"(CUT to inside apartment, continuous. The girls enter)"
"PARIS: We keep the door fully locked, (starts locking the door) even when we're home. We actually added the chains after there were a couple of break-ins on the street, but we've never had any trouble. We've actually got a very sophisticated crime-prevention system set up here. When we leave, we always keep the radio on, rush Limbaugh of course, so they know we have g*n in the house. The lights are all on a timer, so don't touch the switches, and there's a motion detector in the hallway, so don't freak out when it goes on at night. Now, over here is our trusty dog, Bloodhound. (presses play on a tape recorder and we hear barking) Excellent for magazine pushers and pamphlet bearers of all types."
"RORY: You've got it all covered."
"PARIS: Pretty much. That's our room. That's your room. They're both the same size, but we have an extra window 'cause Doyle has dreams about walls collapsing in on him, so he needs to sleep near glass. (a loud noise startles Rory)"
"RORY: Oh, my god! Were those g*n?"
"PARIS: No, that was just a car backfiring. The real g*n actually sounds fake. You'll pick it up eventually. They call it ""ghetto ear."""
"RORY: Something to look forward to."
"PARIS: Now, Doyle sleeps very deeply, so don't worry about the hours. I, as you know, haven't slept through the night since the first time I saw ""The Wizard Of Oz"", thank you Mum, so I tend to do my crafts in the middle of the night, but the walls are very thick. You won't hear a thing. Oh, now, the hot water in the bathroom...(Doyle comes out of their room and starts to attack Paris throwing her on the floor)"
"DOYLE: AAAAAHHHH! (they wrestle a bit rolling around on the floor as Rory observes a bit stunned. Doyle eventually pins Paris down) Aha! You let your guard down, Geller, and I did it. I got the best of you."
"PARIS: I was giving a tour!"
"DOYLE: Admit your defeat!"
"PARIS: Never. Rematch."
"DOYLE: Challenge accepted. (releases her and they both get up)"
"PARIS: Helmets on."
"RORY: What are you doing? What's going on? (Paris and Doyle start getting some protection wear out of a trunk and start to put them on)"
"PARIS: When we moved into the neighbourhood, we thought it would be good to take some self-defence classes."
"DOYLE: Krav Maga, official self-defence, hand-to-hand combat style of Israel."
"RORY: Oh."
"DOYLE: Krav Maga is not about being a tough guy or fighting in a ring. It's about going home alive, no matter what."
"PARIS: And it's the rush. (now both in full gear)"
"DOYLE: Pads on."
"PARIS: Attack on 3. 1...2... (they start to fight)"
"RORY: OK, I'm gonna go get the rest of my stuff, so I'm just gonna...(as they fight Paris gets Doyle in a headlock)"
"DOYLE: Ugh! Steinbeck! Steinbeck!"
"PARIS: That's not your safety word."
"DOYLE: (with a manoeuvre pins Paris down again) I know. It's ""Saroyan""."
"PARIS: You've been practicing behind my back. I love you. (Rory exits)"
"(CUT to outside, morning. Lorelai and Sookie are walking down a street and they seem to be looking for something. Sookie is holding apiece of paper with an address written on it and Lorelai has a cup of take out coffee)"
"SOOKIE: 3418. 3418. Did we pass 3418?"
"LORELAI: Boy, this is some weak coffee."
"SOOKIE: Maybe I wrote it down wrong. ""Across the street from a butcher"". Or a ""barber"". Or a ""Barbara"". ""Across the street from a Barbara"". Ooh, I wonder if it's a famous Barbara, like Streisand or Mandrell."
"LORELAI: OK, I give. (throws the coffee away)"
"SOOKIE: Oh, I think we passed it. This was supposed to be the best place to find wedding invitations, and now we've passed it!"
"LORELAI: And since we passed it, it's just vanished from the face of the earth, never to be seen again. Here. Let me see the paper. (takes the paper from Sookie and reads) Oh, yeah, we passed it."
"SOOKIE: Of course we have."
"LORELAI: And we're on the wrong side of the street."
"SOOKIE: Of course we are. (notices something - a bridal store) Ooh! Look, look."
"LORELAI: What? Aw geez!"
"SOOKIE: Let's go in. (they walk up to the store window)"
"LORELAI: Why?"
"SOOKIE: To look at dresses!"
"LORELAI: Oh, Sookie, I don't even know what kind of dress I want. I may even make my own dress."
"SOOKIE: So what? We can just go in and look around."
"LORELAI: They're gonna look at us funny."
"SOOKIE: What are you talking about? (sing songy voice) You have the golden ticket (points at the ring)"
"LORELAI: (holding up her left hand) I do, don't I?"
"SOOKIE: (sing songy voice and bouncing up and down) You have the golden ticket on your hand"
"LORELAI: Alright, alright. You're gonna stop singing when we go inside, right? Otherwise, they really will look at us funny. (they enter the store)"
"(CUT to inside store, continuous. The women enter)"
"LORELAI: Wow. There's a lot of white."
"SOOKIE: (picks up a ugly dress from a rank) Ooh! Try this on. I dare you."
"LORELAI: I think this is the one Divine turned down for being too over-the-top. (Sookie puts the dress back) Are we allowed to touch these?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know. Do you see anyone here?"
"LORELAI: No (looks around the store and notices something)"
"SOOKIE: Maybe they're in back. Maybe they've been taken hostage by the tulle. (Lorelai start walking towards a dummy dressed in a wedding dress) Where are you going? (Sookie follows) What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Look."
"SOOKIE: Pretty."
"LORELAI: Not pretty. It's perfect. It's the perfect dress."
"SOOKIE: Really? You think?"
"LORELAI: I don't believe it. I just turned around, and there it is, the perfect dress."
"SOOKIE: It's your size."
"LORELAI: The perfect dress is my size. That is weird. (looking around, while Sookie examines the dress) Does anyone work here? (calling out) Hello! Does anyone work here?!"
"SOOKIE: Oh, my God."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: It's on sale. (the girls looks excited and gasp a bit)"
"LORELAI: It's the perfect dress. That's it. I'm trying it on. (Sookie squeals, and they both giggle) Oh my God, look at this. (at the dress) Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not looking for anything serious."
"(CUT to Kim's antiques, evening. Mrs.Kim is fussing with some merchandise as Lane comes in)"
"Mrs.KIM: Look. Woman come in here. Tell me this is full set of 1950s milk glass. Does she think my mother dropped me on my head when I'm a baby? I know Nigella Lawson when I see it."
"LANE: I'm going upstairs. (starts to move towards the staircase)"
"Mrs.KIM: Wait. Talk. How was work?"
"LANE: I handed people food for six and a half hours. It's every little girl's dream."
"Mrs.KIM: I'm making kimchi dumplings tonight."
"LANE: I smell like burgers and fries, so I'll have to shower."
"Mrs.KIM: OK"
"LANE: which means I won't be ready for dinner for at least 45 minutes."
"Mrs.KIM: Fine. I need to make the dumplings. Dumpling don't make themselves."
"LANE: And you might want to put on your Korean television show. Because I'm gonna listen to music, and it's going to be music that you don't approve of. But I'm 21 now, so I'll listen to the music I like when I like, and that's just the way it's gonna be. (Lane goes upstairs as Mrs.Kim breathes deeply and looks concerned)"
"(CUT to Yale, evening. A professor comes out of her office. Rory tries to catch up with her)"
"RORY: Professor Jolene! Professor Jolene!"
"Prof.JOLENE: Sorry. I'm in a bit of a hurry."
"RORY: That's OK. Don't slow down. I'll catch up. (runs up to her) Hi. Rory Gilmore. (they talk as they walk)"
"Prof.JOLENE: Nice to meet you, Rory."
"RORY: And you. Really! I'm actually hoping to get a spot in your class. It was full by the time I got my name in, not that my delay in registering should be taken as lack of enthusiasm."
"Prof.JOLENE: Apparently not."
"RORY: So, anyhow, I'm really hoping to score a spot in your class."
"Prof.JOLENE: Well, add/drop begins tomorrow."
"RORY: I'm aware of that. I just thought I would start putting in a good word for myself right now. So here's the good word: I'm dying to be in your class. I even bought your book, see (show the books she's holding), the one you wrote for the class. I bought it new, not used, so you get full royalty payment on it."
"Prof.JOLENE: Well, thank you."
"RORY: I want to be in your class."
"Prof.JOLENE: I can't make you any promises, but I appreciate your enthusiasm. And, by the way, I get full royalties whether you buy me book new or used."
"RORY: See how much I've learned already?"
"Prof.JOLENE: Goodbye, Rory."
"RORY: I will see you tomorrow. (Prof.Jolene walks away and Rory makes her way to the coffee cart. She comes closer and sees that Logan is sitting, waiting next to the coffee cart. She stops, he gets up)"
"LOGAN: I knew you'd have to hit the coffee cart eventually. (she turns and walks away. Logan looks disappointed)"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, night. Luke is closing up as Lorelai knocks on the diner door holding a box. He opens the door, she enters)"
"LORELAI: Well, we're done."
"LUKE: We're done with what?"
"LORELAI: With the wedding preparations. We're all done. (Lorelai walks over to the counter and leaves the box)"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: I just dropped off a deposit check to the caterer, and I brought you some duck-sausage rolls, by the way. (gives him a small take out box)"
"LUKE: Duck-Sausage rolls. (he takes the take out container and moves behind the counter)"
"LORELAI: I know. They sounded weird to me, too, but they're incredible."
"LUKE: I don't understand. How did this happen? This morning, you didn't know whether you were gonna wear a white dress or not."
"LORELAI: I know. But then Sookie and I went to check out these invitations, you know, and right next door, there was this little bridal shop, and we thought, ""Oh, we'll just go in, look around, you know no big deal"", you know, just girl fun, right? And I went in, and I turned around, and there it was. The perfect dress."
"LUKE: The..."
"LORELAI: The bodice is this blush-coloured silk tulle, and it has all these little crystal beads on it, and the skirt is a blush silk tulle with a blush silk/satin lining, and the back goes into a train. And, oh, it has a cream, satin sash, so you get a little white in there, which I know is very important to you. I tried it on, and it fit me perfectly, and it was on sale, and so I bought it. And from the minute I bought the dress, everything else fell into place."
"LUKE: What does that mean?"
"LORELAI: Well, the dress is strapless, so, hello, summer wedding. And summer means daisies, so flower choice done. And we went into the stationery store, and there was the perfect daisy invitations, which I know sounds a little girly, but, seriously, there are no macho wedding invitations, so please just give me this one, OK?"
"LUKE: OK."
"LORELAI: OK, so I bought the invitations, the place is running a special. They print the invites and mail them for you and handle the RSVP list, so that's done. Then we go to get some coffee, and in the window of the coffee shop, there is a picture of a beautiful rose-covered church. And I thought, ""gee, that's pretty. I wonder where that is"". And do you know where it is?"
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Right around the corner from the coffee shop. So we went in and talked to Pastor Todd."
"LUKE: Pastor Todd?"
"LORELAI: And the church is perfect. And out back, there's a separate function hall with these floor-to-ceiling windows and doors that open out. And behind the hall is this old carrousel."
"LUKE: A carrousel?"
"LORELAI: From 1850. And it should be fully restored and working by June 3rd, which, by the way, is the date of our wedding."
"LUKE: June 3rd?"
"LORELAI: Yes. Which is also miraculously a date that absolutely no one in Stars Hollow has a conflict with, and the Pastor was running a special."
"LUKE: A special?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. I rented the church. And he gave me the hall for half price, and he threw in the use of the carrousel for nothing. And his sister runs a catering company, and Sookie blessed it, and so basically that's it, we're done!"
"LUKE: Huh!"
"LORELAI: It was so weird how this happened, you know. It's like the dress was a sign or something."
"LUKE: There are no signs."
"LORELAI: (notices that is started snowing) Oh, my god!"
"LUKE: What!?"
"LORELAI: Oh, my god! It started snowing. (Luke starts to walk back to her side of the counter) It started snowing right as I started talking about signs. That, my friend, is a sign."
"LUKE: (now on her side of the counter) That is not a sign. That is weather."
"LORELAI: No, this is more than weather. This is fate."
"LUKE: June 3rd, huh?"
"LORELAI: June 3rd."
"LUKE: That's soon."
"LORELAI: I know."
"LUKE: It's less than five months away."
"LORELAI: I know. (they kiss) OK, I better get this back home before the snow gets any worse. (picks up the box and walk towards the door) Oh, and I picked out your tuxedo. You can stop by the place anytime you want, and they were running a special, so the alterations are free."
"(Lorelai exits the diner, and Luke is left alone he sits on chair looking a bit concerned)"
"(CUT to Yale Daily News, morning. The staff, including Rory and Doyle, are sitting around as Paris is handing out the b*at)"
"PARIS: City b*at, Martha Billings. Editorials, Peter Brooke. Sports, Russ Tamblen. Religion b*at, Heather Torrance. Religion b*at, my former b*at. Good luck, Heather. And features, Arlen Sather, Nick Scott, and the returning Rory Gilmore. Also joining our ranks this year, our former editor Doyle McMaster and his new column ""the world according to Doyle"". It's going to be a great term, people, an important term, a term to change the history of the Yale Daily News. The work will be hard. It has to be hard. Nothing less than perfect will be tolerated. Please remember that I am your editor. I am not your mother or your hugger. If you need some love, get a hooker. If you're having a bad day, find a ledge or a way to deal. My door is not open to you ever. You have five minutes to enjoy your cookies. Welcome to the Yale Daily News. (the meeting breaks up, the staffers go back to their desks as Rory goes up to Paris)"
"RORY: Thanks for the features b*at, Paris."
"PARIS: You deserve it. You're a good writer."
"RORY: Thank you. And, I know, you're gonna be a great editor."
"PARIS: I plan on it."
"RORY: Yeah. But, you know, you might want to ease up just a tad."
"PARIS: What do you mean?"
"RORY: You know, the ""five minutes for the cookies"", the ""no talking"" signs posted everywhere, the ""no decorating your desk"" rule, the new demerit system, the locks on the bathroom doors. It's just all a little, um, harsh and restrictive. This is a newsroom. People should be able to talk, yell, joke around..."
"PARIS: I don't agree."
"RORY: ...Go to the bathroom."
"PARIS: Journalism is an art form, and the best art is created under repression, like Stalin's gulag. You think Solzhenitsyn could have written ""One Day In The Life Of Ivan Denisovich"" on a yoga retreat?"
"RORY: Paris, I don't really think..."
"PARIS: Oh, great. (Rory looks around and we see Logan just entered the news room and greats another staffer) I got a call saying your boyfriend was coming back."
"RORY: He's not my boyfriend anymore, Paris. We broke up."
"PARIS: Hey, keep your personal stuff at home, OK? I can't be seen caring about this. (calling out to Logan) My door is not open! (gets Logan's attention) Huntzberger! My office, now! (Paris goes to her office and Logan follows her, he tries to great Rory who avoids him. She goes over to her desk and starts collecting her stuff)"
"(CUT to Paris's office, continuous. Paris is standing as Logan walks in)"
"PARIS: Sit down, Logan. Let's have a little talk about your future."
"LOGAN: Sure, Paris. (Paris goes behind her desk and sits. Logan sits on a chair opposite her)"
"PARIS: Now, I know you think your sugar daddy runs the world, and that includes this paper, and possibly in the past that was true, but not anymore. You don't scare me. (Logan leans back on his chair to get a clear view of Rory's desk, which he sees is empty) Your daddy doesn't scare me. Your mommy doesn't scare me. If you have a brother, a sister, or a really angry cat, they don't scare me, either. Hey, either spin a plate on your nose while you do that or cut it out, 'cause I am speaking."
"LOGAN: Sorry."
"PARIS: Oh, you will be. Now let's talk about deadlines, emphasis on ""dead""."

"(CUT to outside Rory, Paris and Doyle's apartment, morning. Rory is giving Lorelai a tour. They come up the stairs)"
"RORY: So, the elevator's getting fixed on Monday, but I'm thinking I may not even use it 'cause the stairs are excellent exercise. And I love having a hallway. I've never had a hallway before. And I am really lucky that Paris and Doyle hadn't rented out that other room yet. I mean, this location is really in demand."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: (starts to unlock the door) Oh, yeah. I mean, it is literally 10 minutes from campus. You know how hard I'm gonna have to work to be late for class?"
"LORELAI: Those guys down there, are they your neighbours?"
"RORY: Um, no. They're a Doo-Wop group."
"LORELAI: Um. (seeing all the locks on the door) You have some plutonium back there or something?"
"RORY: Uh, no, just Paris, you know. She's quirky. (kicks the door, and opens) OK, welcome to my place."
"(CUT to inside apartment, continuous. The girls enter)"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Mom, give it a chance."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Look, we have a really big living room."
"LORELAI: Uh, No."
"RORY: I know it just looks rundown, but everything works fine."
"LORELAI: (looking at the kitchen) No!"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: (Lorelai starts to walk around the house) OK, tour's over. Time for lunch."
"LORELAI: (pointing at stuff around the house) No."
"RORY: Let's go."
"LORELAI: (keeps on pointing)No. No. (opens Paris and Doyle's bedroom door. They are fighting, well actually Paris is kicking Doyle?s ass. Lorelai covers Rory's eyes)"
"DOYLE: Saroyan! Saroyan!"
"LORELAI: Aah!"
"LORELAI: No, no, no."
"RORY: OK, OK. (they start to exit)"
"(CUT to Kim's antiques, morning. Lane is trying to make a sale)"
"CUSTOMER: It's very nice."
"LANE: It's one of a kind."
"CUSTOMER: Will you take two fifty?"
"LANE: For that chair?"
"CUSTOMER: Well, it does have some nicks."
"LANE: That chair is two hundred years old. It's gonna have some nicks. It sat in James Madison's bedroom. This chair is a piece of history. We shouldn't even be allowed to sell it to you."
"CUSTOMER: Well, I didn't mean to insult you."
"LANE: You didn't insult me. You insulted the chair and the United States of America."
"CUSTOMER: All right. Three hundred's fine."
"LANE: Forget it."
"CUSTOMER: That's what the price tag says."
"LANE: The price just went up flag burner. If you want the chair, it's three fifty. If you don't, please leave, because I have a lot of work to do."
"CUSTOMER: Well..."
"LANE: Bye."
"CUSTOMER: Three fifty. Here. (starts to get money out of her purse) Do you take cash?"
"LANE: Exact change only."
"CUSTOMER: I don't suppose you have a delivery service. (Lane sternly looks at her) Oh, that's okay. I'll...I'll take it with me right now. (takes the chair and starts to leave. Lane goes off to put the money away. Mrs.Kim come up to her)"
"Mrs.KIM: You forgot to kick her in the pants as she walked out."
"LANE: I made the sale, didn't I?"
"Mrs.KIM: Yes, but with a little less bite. A customer might come back."
"LANE: You always drive a hard bargain."
"Mrs.KIM: Yes, I do."
"LANE: OK, then!"
"Mrs.KIM: We do have a delivery service."
"LANE: Yeah, me in a minivan. Not in the mood, no matter how exciting the prospect of a $2 tip is."
"Mrs.KIM: Too bad it's not Christmas. That smiley face of yours would cheer up children for miles around. (Zach comes in the store)"
"LANE: Oh, Zach (walk up to him)...Zach! You have a lot of nerve just to walk into my place like this."
"ZACH: What are you talking about? This is like a place of business. Maybe I want to buy some antiques."
"LANE: Oh, right!"
"ZACH: You're not wearing your glasses anymore."
"LANE: What do you want, Zach?"
"ZACH: I think you have a CD of mine."
"LANE: What CD?"
"ZACH: You know, the one with like a crazy-looking chick on it."
"LANE: I don't have any of your CDs, Zach."
"ZACH: I think you do. I can go up to your room and check it out. (start to walk upstairs)"
"LANE: (stops him) No! Zach, you can't go up to my room and check. I'll look and if I find a CD with a crazy-looking chick on it, I'll mail it to you."
"ZACH: Seriously? Let's go upstairs and look now."
"LANE: I'm working, Zach."
"ZACH: Yeah, I can tell there's a major rush on ancient crap going on her... (Mrs.Kim walks up to assist a customer and notices the scene going on)"
"LANE: (pushes him towards the door) Bye, Zach!"
"ZACH: Five minutes, Lane."
"LANE: Out, Zach!"
"ZACH: It's my favourite CD."
"LANE: Out!"
"ZACH: Fine! (he leaves)"
"Mrs.KIM: (to customer) I'm sorry"
"LANE: (at the customer) Hey, you break it, you buy it!"
"(CUT to Rich Man's Shoe pub, morning. Lorelai and Rory are having lunch)"
"LORELAI: Oh, Rory."
"RORY: Come on. It's not so bad."
"LORELAI: It's ""Angela's Ashes""."
"RORY: It's basic."
"LORELAI: It's ""Sanford and Son""."
"RORY: Mom, the neighbourhood is safe. A ton of kids from school live there. And they have a safety van that goes to and from campus, so I don't have to walk home at night."
"LORELAI: That wasn't a Doo-Wop group, was it?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Let's call daddy. Make him pay for an apartment with one lock."
"RORY: No. Look, this is the way it's supposed to be. I am in college. Don't you see? I'm supposed to live in a crappy apartment. I'm supposed to eat ramen noodles and mac and cheese for months. I've been living in a pool house with maids and fresh-cut flowers and mints on my pillow every night."
"LORELAI: You got to love my mother sometimes."
"RORY: This is good and right, and I'm happy, and I have roommates who are learning to k*ll people, so where is the bad? Now let's talk about you. How are the wedding plans going?"
"LORELAI: Done."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: All done."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: The dress, the cake, the place, the invitations. June 3rd, by the way."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Yeah. I also bought your dress and shoes."
"RORY: How did all this happen?"
"LORELAI: Well, I found this dress, which, at the time, seemed like the perfect dress, and from the dress, all the other details fell into place. By the end of the day I was done."
"RORY: That's great."
"LORELAI: Is it?"
"RORY: Isn't it?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Yes, sure, I thought it was. I mean I thought it was a sign or something, you know, finding the dress. And then when, oohh when it started to snow, I was like, ""somebody's telling me something""."
"RORY: So it would seem."
"LORELAI: But then I started thinking..."
"RORY: Uh-oh."
"LORELAI: It was all too easy. Planning a wedding shouldn't be easy because marriage isn't easy."
"RORY: How do you know? You've never been married."
"LORELAI: Exactly."
"RORY: ""Exactly"" what?"
"LORELAI: I have never been married because it's not easy, and I usually freak out and screw everything up. I freaked out and screwed everything up with Max, remember?"
"RORY: Yeah, but..."
"LORELAI: But I haven't freaked out about Luke yet. Why haven't I freaked out about Luke yet? It's my pattern. It's what I do, and then I started freaking out about the fact that I hadn't freaked out."
"RORY: Oh, dear! You got caught in the circle of freak out."
"LORELAI: What if this dress is really a bad sign, not a good sign? What if the dress is telling me that it's so right, it's wrong?"
"RORY: Mom!"
"LORELAI: What if I'm about to bail out and I don't even know it?"
"RORY: You are driving yourself crazy."
"LORELAI: What if all the signs are saying things shouldn't be this easy, that I shouldn't get the guy I want? What if it's like that ""Twilight Zone"" where the woman on a horse is being chased by another woman on a horse who turns out is older her chasing younger her, trying to tell her that she should not run off with the guy she's going to run off with because it will be a terrible, terrible mistake."
"RORY: OK, King George, take a breath, eat a fry, and listen to me. The dress is a good sign. Everything fell into place because it should. It's all right. The dress is right, the date is right, Luke is right. And the snow. Remember the snow? The snow never lies."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"RORY: Be happy. This is all good."
"LORELAI: Thanks. I'm gonna miss you when you're m*rder and stuffed into a dumpster by the Doo-Wop group."
"RORY: So tell me about my dress."
"LORELAI: Two words ""hoop skirt"""
"RORY: Nice."
"LORELAI: In a lovely shade of tangerine."
"RORY: Excellent."
"LORELAI: And the minute I saw it, I thought, ""this would totally be Rory if only it had a few more ruffles""."
"RORY: A fry with your evilness?"
"LORELAI: Why, thank you."
"(CUT to Nardini house, morning. Luke knocks on the door. Anna opens)"
"ANNA: Hello, stranger."
"LUKE: Hey. Uh, can...can I come in?"
"ANNA: Why not?"
"(CUT to inside house, continuous)"
"LUKE: Sorry about barging in on you like that."
"ANNA: Hey, it's fine. I'm making tea. You want some tea?"
"LUKE: Uh, sure. Tea sounds like tea. (Anna goes off to the kitchen to prep the tea)"
"ANNA: April's not here right now. She's tracking a grub migration. All inquiries stopped after the word ""grub""."
"LUKE: That's okay. I came by to see you, actually."
"ANNA: Oh, yeah?"
"LUKE: Yeah. (looking around the house) You got a lot of stuff here. You sell clothes?"
"ANNA: Clothes, pillows, candles, fabrics. It's one of those everything kind of boutiques that used to send you in a ""what do people need with all this crap?"" kind of rant."
"LUKE: Oh, yeah. Well, that's nice."
"ANNA: (walk up to him and hands him a cup) Thanks. Here."
"LUKE: Thanks. (sips) It tastes like tea."
"ANNA: Uh, this is weird."
"LUKE: I know."
"ANNA: It's been a very long time."
"LUKE: I know."
"ANNA: I actually saw you once about five years ago in the parking lot of some lumberyard."
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"ANNA: Yeah, I waved, but you either didn't see me or didn't want to see me."
"LUKE: I didn't see you. I would have waved back, unless I was holding stuff, and then I would have nodded or something."
"ANNA: Sure. I'm sure. I thought about you when the Red Sox won."
"LUKE: Really?"
"ANNA: I knew it would be a big day for you."
"LUKE: It was.(after a b*at) How come you didn't tell me, Anna?"
"ANNA: Luke..."
"LUKE: It was a phone call."
"ANNA: We should sit down. (they sit)"
"LUKE: I've been in the same place forever. Haven't moved. You certainly knew how to find me."
"ANNA: Luke, come on. We'd already broken up by the time I found out, and I knew how you felt about kids."
"LUKE: What do you mean, ""how I felt about kids""?"
"ANNA: You hate kids."
"LUKE: I don't hate kids."
"ANNA: What are you talking about?"
"LUKE: I don't!"
"ANNA: We couldn't go the movies before ten o'clock at night in case there were kids in the theatre."
"LUKE: Well, kids talk during a movie, and they throw crap around. They run up and down the aisles. They're animals."
"ANNA: We would move tables in a restaurant if they seated us near a family."
"LUKE: Only if there was something crying or spitting up."
"ANNA: You would flip out if you saw a woman breast-feeding in public, you couldn't stand to watch diaper commercials and you had an unnatural hatred of Macaulay Culkin."
"LUKE: OK, fine. I hated kids, but I'm not that guy anymore."
"ANNA: Thirteen years ago, you were that guy."
"LUKE: It doesn't mean I would have been like that with my kid. I mean even if I would have been like that with my kid, I still had a right to know."
"ANNA: I'm sorry."
"LUKE: Yeah. Well, you know, I could have helped. I could have helped pay for stuff and take care of things."
"ANNA: I didn't need you to pay for stuff or take care of things."
"LUKE: This is my responsibility, too. And now that I know, I have to do something."
"ANNA: What does that mean? It means I want to offer you whatever assistance I can."
"ANNA: I don't..."
"LUKE: Monetary, of course, and compensation for the past 12 years."
"ANNA: But we really don't need anything. It was not my idea for April to call you. It was all her thing. She got obsessed with winning that science contest, and she's really a smart, driven kid. She's already written a short novel, and she's got her own website. So she went through my old letters and put the whole thing together and, frankly, didn't tell me anything about it till way after the fact. I did not send her to you."
"LUKE: I know you didn't, but she came to me, and now I know, and I want to help. I'm not talking about contact here. I know you've got your life, here. I don't want to mess things up. I just want to live up to my end of the bargain."
"ANNA: You don't owe us anything, Luke. We want for nothing and always have. But if you want to chip in, then, sure, chip in."
"LUKE: Really? Great. That's great. That's really...Thank you."
"ANNA: Thank you."
"LUKE: Yeah. OK, well, that's all I came to say, so...so I guess I'll get going. (they put the cups down and get up)"
"ANNA: Hey Luke, it was really great seeing you."
"LUKE: You too. Tell April ""hi"" for me. (they start walking to the door)"
"ANNA: I will do that. Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Yeah?"
"ANNA: You happy?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"ANNA: Me too. This is pretty cool, isn't it?"
"LUKE: Yeah, it is. (he exits)"
"(CUT to outside Rory, Paris and Doyle's apartment, morning. Rory is coming up the stairs, and notices something. It's Logan waiting outside of the apartment with coffee. She tries to ignore him)"
"LOGAN: I brought coffee, but it's cold. (she puts down her stuff without answering him and starts to open the door) It's a nice place you got here. I've been discussing the ""baking soda to actual crack"" ratio you can get away with your neighbours downstairs. 2 to 1 during the daylight, 3 to 1 at night."
"RORY: I have ten minutes to change. Then I have someplace I have to be."
"LOGAN: It's gonna take you twenty to unlock your door."
"RORY: Bye, Logan."
"LOGAN: This place is a dump, Rory. You can't live here."
"RORY: (turns around to face him) You don't get to care about where I live anymore, Logan. You broke up with me...through your sister."
"LOGAN: I didn't mean for that to happen."
"RORY: You're a coward. Mr.""Life and Death Brigade"" can't even break up with his girlfriend."
"LOGAN: Honor was bugging me, and I just told her we broke up to shut her up. I needed some time."
"RORY: So you didn't mean it?"
"LOGAN: No, I did. I just...it was too much for me, OK?"
"RORY: It was a fight. People fight."
"LOGAN: Yeah, well I don't fight, I don't want to be screaming at you at a bar. I can't take that. It's too much drama."
"RORY: Well, if you can't take the drama, then you shouldn't even be in a relationship, which, by the way, you're not, so everything's good."
"LOGAN: It's not that easy."
"RORY: Sure, it is."
"LOGAN: You want some help?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LOGAN: I bet one of those guys downstairs could help you out getting into a locked apartment."
"RORY: Ugh! (does the kicking the door part of opening the door) Just go be somewhere else, Logan."
"LOGAN: (she starts to pick up her stuff) I thought that I wanted to break up. I thought that it was a stupid experiment, me trying to be a boyfriend, that it didn't work, and I'd just move on. And I didn't. Couldn't, actually. (as she's about to go in) Rory...I love you."
"RORY: (stares at him for a b*at) I have an appointment. I have to go. (she goes in the apartment and leaves Logan outside who's looking a bit upset)"
"(CUT to Dr.Shapiro's office - the shrink -, morning. The Doctor opens the door and Rory enters)"
"RORY: Sorry I'm late."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: Well, considering how many times you rescheduled, I'm just happy you're here at all."
"RORY: I was just spending some time with my mother, you know. We were apart for a while, so..."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: You were?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: Falling-out?"
"RORY: Nothing major. Just mother/daughter stuff. (the Doc nods, Rory trying to get out of an uncomfortable situation) I don't have to lie down, do I?"
"Dr.SHAPIRO: No. That's not a ""lying down"" couch. (they walk over to sit down)"
"RORY: Good. (they sit and the doc take out his notes)"
"Dr.SHAPIRO: So, did this falling-out have anything to do with your dropping out of school?"
"RORY: Boy, we just jumped into this, didn't we?"
"Dr.SHAPIRO: You want to talk about something else first?"
"RORY: No."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: I mean, we're here to talk about you leaving school, so I figured, ""let's just start there"". What happened?"
"RORY: Nothing. We fought. I'm fine. We're fine."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: I hear you had some legal problems. (as he talks he takes notes)"
"RORY: My, those are some big ears you have there, grandma."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: Stealing a boat is a pretty big deal."
"RORY: I was upset."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: About what?"
"RORY: About life and things and stuff."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: You spent a night in jail?"
"RORY: Yes, I did."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: How did that feel?"
"RORY: Great."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: You don't want to talk about this, either?"
"RORY: I'm just...I'm sick of talking about it, that's all."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: You seem very agitated."
"RORY: I'm not agitated. I... So, I spent a night in jail. Big deal. So did Martin Luther King."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: Are you comparing yourself with Martin Luther King?"
"RORY: No, I'm not. I just, I'm saying that he spent a night in jail, too."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: You were arrested with your boyfriend?"
"RORY: Yes, I was."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: Tell me about that."
"RORY: About what? He was my boyfriend then, and now he's not."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: He's not?"
"RORY: No, he's not. We broke up. No. Oh, no. I'm sorry. He broke up. I thought that we were just taking some time, but apparently I'm a moron."
"Dr.SHAPIRO: (consulting his notes) Uh, this is Logan?"
"RORY: What, you have his name, too? Super. Do you also have the picture of him hijacking me in my hallway earlier today?"
"Dr.SHAPIRO: I'm sorry. What?"
"RORY: I mean how fair is that? He's gone, and then he shows up out of the blue. (mimicking Logan's voice) ""You can't live here. This place is a dump. And, by the way, I love you"". (normal voice) ""I love you""?! Is he serious?!"
"Dr.SHAPIRO: I don't know."
"RORY: (getting all worked up and in the verge of tears) Nothing for weeks, and then he just decides that he loves me. So, what happens now? I get another Birkin bag? And how long until he doesn't love me again, huh? (the doc passes her a box of tissues, because she's started to cry. Rory takes the box and takes a tissue) I stole a boat with him! I never stole a boat with Dean!"
"Dr.SHAPIRO: Who's Dean?"
"RORY: My married ex-boyfriend who I lost my virginity to!"
"Dr.SHAPIRO: Wow. (takes some notes)"
"RORY: Yeah. I'm a treat. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I-I don't think I can take running into him every day in the halls and the paper and the coffee cart. Oh, my god. I'm gonna have to quit drinking coffee, and I love coffee! (breaking down in tears and gabbing as many tissues as she can, as the doctor looks very concerned) I really love coffee."
"(CUT to outside Stars Hollow, morning. Kirk and Luke are walking around town. Kirk is holding a laptop trying to find a wireless less internet, Luke is following him)"
"LUKE: I feel like an idiot."
"KIRK: Just relax, Luke. It should only take a couple more minutes."
"LUKE: I've been following you around the town square for half an hour."
"KIRK: I know there's a wireless internet hub around here somewhere. Ah! (moves back and forth a bit) No. Encrypted. I used to use the bank's access, but I had to stand right in front of the versa teller machine, and they got very snippy about that. Then Doose's had it for a while, but Taylor but a block on it. It's sad what this world is coming to."
"LUKE: You know what, why don't I just find someone who actually has the internet?"
"KIRK: Hold on. Hold on. We have achieved contact."
"LUKE: We have?"
"KIRK: Yes, courtesy of Stars Hollow Books. (they sit at the edge of the sidewalk) OK. Now, tell me what you need."
"LUKE: Uh, I just, uh, need to look up a website."
"KIRK: OK. Give me the name, and I'll type it in for you."
"LUKE: Well I..."
"KIRK: Hold on. Is this one of those websites? 'Cause if they'll come after Pete Townsend, no one is safe."
"LUKE: Kirk, just tell me what to do,"
"and I'll do it myself."
"KIRK: Are you sure?"
"LUKE: Yes. Just, (takes the laptop) here."
"KIRK: OK, give me your hand, (reaches to grab Luke's hand) and I'll guide..."
"LUKE: (slaps Kirk's hand away) Stop it."
"KIRK: Oouii! Alright. Just click here, then type in the name of the website here, then press here."
"LUKE: OK."
"KIRK: This makes the page go up and down..."
"LUKE: Yeah, I can figure out the rest, Kirk."
"KIRK: Alright. I'll be over here if you need me. (gets up)"
"LUKE: I've never felt safer in my life. (Luke opens Aprils' site and snoops around a bit. Sees pictures of her -birthdays, with friends, with her uncle in a back brace- and looks very proud, happy and a bit sad)"
"(CUT to Kim's antiques, night. It's closing time. Mrs.Kim is saying goodbye to the last customer as Lane comes up to her)"
"Mrs.KIM: Thank you for coming. We appreciate your business. (locks the door)"
"LANE: Everything's dusted. The receipts are organized. I'm not hungry. I'm going upstairs. (starts to walk up the staircase)"
"Mrs.KIM: Lane Kim! Come down now! (Lane come back down. Mrs.Kim turns around the closed sign and closes the door window shutter) Follow me. (they start walking around the store for Mrs.Kim to close the curtains Help me. (they move a dresser to cover a window without curtains) Good. Come."
"(they go to the kitchen. Mrs.Kim uses a chair to reach up to a high kitchen cupboard. Lane looks surprised as her mother gets out a hidden bottle of vodka and two sh**t glasses. Mrs.Kim motions Lane to sit, they both do, and she serves the drink)"
"LANE: (picks up the glass and smells the content) Whoa."
"Mrs.KIM: Lane, it's been six weeks since you come home. You have grieved, and now we move on. (they drink) Ahh. One more. (she pours some more)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's bedroom, night. Lorelai is looking at the dress, which is hanging on the closet door, as PA come up and starts barking)"
"LORELAI: Hey, buddy. Yeah, there is something weird about it, right? What? What is it? (Lorelai opens the closet door and PA enters, picks up a shoe and leaves. Lorelai looks resigned with the concept of PA stealing shoes. The phone starts to ring and she picks it up) Hello?"
"RORY: (on phone) Guess who's crazy."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"RORY: (on phone) Me."
"LORELAI: You? Since when?"
"(CUT to Yale, continuous. Rory is at the dining room hall. The scene switches between Rory at Yale and Lorelai at home)"
"RORY: Since I went all Frances Farmer in my psychologists evaluation today."
"LORELAI: Alright, I'm on the bed and comfortable. Should I get popcorn, or is it a shorter story than that?"
"RORY: I went home from class to get ready for the appointment, and Logan was there."
"LORELAI: At your apartment?"
"RORY: In the hallway. And, of course, I couldn't get my door open fast enough, so he started talking."
"LORELAI: What did he say?"
"RORY: He said he loved me."
"LORELAI: No way."
"RORY: And it completely threw me. And I got out of there as fast as I could. But then I got to Dr.Shapiro's office, and he started peppering me with all these questions, and I just got more and more upset. Then I exploded all over the place. I went through two boxes of kleenex, I started hyperventilating, and I had to breathe into a paper bag."
"LORELAI: Do you believe him?"
"RORY: Believe who?"
"LORELAI: Logan. Do you believe he loves you?"
"RORY: I don't know. I guess I can figure that out next week in therapy."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: After my little meltdown, Dr.Shapiro thinks I should come see him once a week for the next two months."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"RORY: There are no jokes in the mental-health field, only hand puppets, inkblots, and inflatable anger bats."
"LORELAI: I'm so sorry you're a nut."
"RORY: That's OK. I'm sure Dr.Shapiro has a nice padded room for me."
"LORELAI: Well don't let them put you on any of those pills. Tom Cruise will be very upset."
"RORY: Alright. I should go. I have a massive amount of reading to do. I just wanted to call and say ""hi""."
"LORELAI: OK. Remember. Blame it all on Grandma."
"RORY: Will do."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"RORY: Bye. (they hang up)"
"(Lorelai looks over at the dress)"
"(CUT to Luke's apartment, night. Luke is looking at him phone like he's trying to make a decision. Finally he starts looking through his pockets and takes out piece of paper and dials, breathing ""OK"". He calls Anna, who is fussing with some pillows. The scene switches between Luke's apartment and Anna's house)"
"ANNA: (picks up the phone) Hold on. (throws it on the floor)"
"LUKE: Hello?"
"ANNA: Just a sec. Major pillow emergency happening here."
"LUKE: What? Anna?"
"ANNA: (picks the phone from the floor) Sorry. Hi. Who's this?"
"LUKE: It's, uh, Luke."
"ANNA: Luke? Wow, when it rains, it..."
"LUKE: I saw her website."
"ANNA: Her...?"
"LUKE: I saw her pictures. The one in the lab and the one with the Christmas tree, and you never told me she wore a back brace. Why was she wearing a back brace?"
"ANNA: Oh, she had just read ""Deenie"". It was a phase."
"LUKE: Well, still, I should have known."
"ANNA: That she had just read ""Deenie""?"
"LUKE: Yes, and that she was going through a phase and was a science wiz and wear crazy bike helmets and glasses and looked like me."
"ANNA: Just the nose."
"LUKE: The nose is something. I mean, there's no one else running around with my nose."
"ANNA: That you know of."
"LUKE: Is this funny to you?"
"ANNA: No. I'm sorry."
"LUKE: You should've told me."
"ANNA: Luke, we went through all this already. I..."
"LUKE: I want contact."
"ANNA: What?"
"LUKE: I want a relationship. I want to talk to her and see her on a regular basis."
"ANNA: But you said..."
"LUKE: I don't care what I said. This is what I want. I want to know my own daughter, and I want her to know me."
"ANNA: OK."
"LUKE: Really?"
"ANNA: Well, it's really up to April, but if she's cool, then I'm cool."
"LUKE: Oh. So, uh, is, uh, April there now?"
"ANNA: No. But she'll be home pretty soon. Can I have her call you?"
"LUKE: Yes. No."
"ANNA: No?"
"LUKE: I should call her."
"ANNA: She'll definitely be home by eight."
"LUKE: Then I will call back at eight."
"ANNA: OK."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"ANNA: You're welcome."
"LUKE: Hey, Anna?"
"ANNA: Mmm?"
"LUKE: What the hell is ""Deenie""?"
"ANNA: The gospel according to Judy Blume."
"LUKE: What?"
"ANNA: It's a book, Luke. And now would probably be a good time for you to read it. Bye."
"LUKE: Bye. (they hang up)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house, night. Luke comes in looking for Lorelai)"
"LUKE: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI (OS): Uuuhh, Luke, I'm upstairs!"
"LUKE: Yeah, uh, can you come down? I have to talk to you about something."
"LORELAI (OS): OK. Yes, I will come down, but I'm coming down in my wedding dress."
"LUKE: What? No!"
"LORELAI (OS): Yes!"
"LUKE: It's bad luck for me to see the wedding dress."
"LORELAI (OS): I know, but I need you to see this dress. There's something not right up here. It was too easy. I can't be objective anymore."
"LUKE: But..."
"LORELAI (OS): Coming down."
"LUKE: But I don't... (stops talking as he sees Lorelai coming down in the dress. She walks up to him)"
"LORELAI: Well?"
"LUKE: It's...you're perfect."
"LORELAI: Really? Have you seen the back? I think the train's a little weird, and I can take it back if you don't think..."
"LUKE: It's perfect."
"LORELAI: Are you sure? (he reaches out to kiss her and they do) OK. It's not bad luck if it's under five minutes. (she runs up the stairs and Luke is left alone looking upset with himself)"

"(OPEN in Lorelai and Luke's bedroom, night. PA is sleeping at the foot of the bed and Luke and Lorelai are sleeping in it. Suddenly bells start ringing, and the couple wakes up startled)"
"LORELAI: Oh, my god!"
"LUKE: What is that?"
"LORELAI: What is...Is it in the house?"
"LUKE: It's church bells."
"LORELAI: Whe...How'd the church bells get in the house?"
"LUKE: They're outside."
"LORELAI: Whe...In the yard?"
"LUKE: No, at the church. What time is it?"
"LORELAI: It's three twelve. Why are the church bells ringing at three twelve?"
"LUKE: I don't know. I was having a dream, too. I was shopping for a car and I wanted to see the trunk space, and... 'cause I have a truck and it's convenient to haul things. So I wanted to see what the deal with the car was, and the salesman opened it. I asked him how many cubic feet it was and he looked it up in the manual and I was satisfied. So when he closed the hood, the bells rang."
"LORELAI: You have very mundane dreams."
"KIRK (mumbled from outside): Town meeting."
"LORELAI: Huh!"
"MAN (mumbled from outside): Town meeting."
"LORELAI: What was that?"
"LUKE: Some dead guy yelling something."
"LORELAI: Ghosts are yelling something outside the house?"
"LUKE: No, guys I'm gonna k*ll yelling stuff outside the house."
"KIRK (mumbled from outside): Town meeting."
"LORELAI: What are they saying?"
"LUKE: There was a clown b*at?"
"LORELAI: Huh! Not again."
"MAN (mumbled from outside): Town meeting,"
"KIRK (clearly from outside): Town meeting."
"LUKE: Now, they're saying, ""town meeting""."
"LORELAI: Town meeting? At this hour?"
"LUKE: What the hell is Taylor up to?"
"(At the same time)"
"LUKE: Lets get back to sleep."
"LORELAI: All right. Guess we better go."
"LUKE: What? I'm going back to bed."
"LORELAI: What? You can't go back to sleep."
"LORELAI: Come on, it's a town meeting."
"LUKE: It's the middle of the night."
"LORELAI: Uh, sorry, we might miss something. (Lorelai gets out of bed and starts pulling Luke's arm, he groans)"
"(CUT to Patty's studio during the town meeting, same night. People in pj's are taking their seats around the hall as Lorelai and Luke enter)"
"LUKE: Oh, good, full house. Just goes to show how easily manipulated we all are. You ring a bell, we drool like dogs. (they walk towards a couple of seats and sit in front of Babette)"
"LORELAI: Just don't drool where we sit. It'll be messy."
"BABETTE: Hey, you guys hear the bells?"
"LUKE: No, we were just on one of our spontaneous three-in-the-morning strolls, saw everybody in here, and wondered, ""hey, what's up?""."
"BABETTE: Really?"
"LUKE: No."
"BABETTE: (to Lorelai) He's cranky at three in the morning."
"LORELAI: Any idea what this is about?"
"BABETTE: No, Taylor's not even here yet, and Kirk's up there, futzing with something, but he won't tell us what's going on."
"KIRK: (from the stage, fussing with a screen) We're just about ready here, folks."
"LUKE: Ready for what? What is this?"
"KIRK: Here we go. (presses a button on the screen. Taylor appears on the screen)"
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Greetings, everyone."
"LORELAI: Taylor?"
"BABETTE: He's in a little box."
"LUKE: The nightmare continues."
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Is it looking okay, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Yeah, you could use a little pancake."
"PATTY: Weird. I can still smell his cologne."
"TAYLOR (From Screen): People, we have a tremendous problem that needs our immediate attention. That's why I chose the extraordinary step of broadcasting to you tonight from this remote location. (a ping-pong ball hits him on the head) Ow!"
"LUKE: What was that?"
"LORELAI: Looked like a ping-pong ball."
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Now, as we all know, the Annual Stars Hollow Winter Carnival is this weekend. (another ping-pong ball hits him) Ow! (turns to someone we can't see on he screen) Timmy, do not throw ping-pong balls at me."
"TIMMY (OS): You're a Doo-doo head."
"TAYLOR (From Screen): And do not call me a Doo-doo head. I'm in the middle of something important."
"LUKE: Where the hell are you, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR (From Screen): I'm at my sister's in Maine. Anyway, we have never not had a Stars Hollow Winter Carnival. It's a hundred and twenty-five year tradition."
"LORELAI: Is he getting to the point soon?"
"BABETTE: Yeah, come on, Doo-doo head."
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Fine, let's cut to the chase. I run the winter carnival, it's this weekend, and I am snowed in, unable to get back into town. (gets no reaction from the town)"
"PATTY: So, what's this about, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Maybe it's the lateness of the hour or the computer connection isn't clear. (another ping-pong ball)"
"TIMMY (OS): Doo-doo head!"
"TAYLOR (From Screen): We have never had to cancel a carnival, and it's absolutely impossible for me to get back into town to run it. (Luke yawns)"
"BABETTE: I must be tired. I'm not getting this."
"PATTY: It's like a riddle or something."
"TAYLOR (From Screen): People, are you not hearing me? I won't be there to run the carnival. Draw the obvious conclusion."
"PATTY: Oh, OK, I got it now."
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Thank you, patty."
"PATTY: Kirk, could you take it over?"
"KIRK: Sure."
"PATTY: Great. Anything else, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Oh, well, good for you, people. I guess we don't have to cancel it after all."
"LORELAI: Thanks, Taylor. (to Luke. Pats his knee) Come on, let's get you to bed. (everyone starts to get up from their seats)"
"LUKE: (as they start to exit the studio) I'm gonna fall back to sleep and dream about running Taylor over in that car I was looking at."
"LORELAI: Oh. Is there enough room to put his body in the trunk? (Luke nods as they exit)"
"TAYLOR (From Screen): Now, then, I would recommend that we immediately start discussing some details. The sooner, the better is always best. Now, then, food. We'll obviously have the carnival staples. (people are no longer paying attention to Taylor and are slowly exiting the hall. It's almost empty) French dip sandwiches, corn on the cob, apple cider, et cetera. Now, we almost ran out of hot chocolate last year, so I would recommend upping the supply by 11%. Timmy! Put down that Rubik?s cube. Timmy, do not throw that Rubik?s cube at me."
"OPENING CREDITS"
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Luke seems very tired as he's pouring coffee to some customers)"
"LUKE: Here...here...here."
"CUSTOMER 1: This was tea."
"LUKE: Now you got a hybrid. That's very in right now. (walks over to Lorelai's table who's drinking coffee and is going over some papers and stuff)"
"LORELAI: I've gotten so much done this morning, it's scary."
"LUKE: Coffee? (walks over to a nearby table to get an empty cup)"
"LORELAI: I already got some. I saw the sunrise. I paid all my bills. (Luke brings the cup over and starts to pour coffee) I already got some, hon. And, this is a first, I saw the beginning of Katie Couric. I don't think I've seen the first five minutes of her in my life. You know, she and Matt Lauer are much more serious in the first half-hour than they are later on. I guess that makes sense. You know, you can afford to make people sad and angry about w*r and the economy and stuff when they first wake up. But then, just as they're heading to the office, you leave them with a dose of Matthew McConaughey, ""people's sexiest man"", and whoosh! they're rarin' to go."
"LUKE: (yawing) Yeah, Matthew McConaughey always gets me rarin'. (Kirk outside is busy with the fair stuff)"
"LORELAI: And I'm even volunteering to, um, man a booth at the carnival this year. I got a great concept, too. What about you? You got anything special planned today?"
"LUKE: (startled and very nervous) Today? No, not today. It's a bunch of the same old, same old errands. The usual."
"CUSTOMER 1: Not liking my ""hybrid""."
"LUKE: Coming. (they peck on the lips) I'll call you later."
"LORELAI: (pointing at the two cups of coffee) See what you did here?"
"LUKE: Sorry. (takes both cups and walks away)"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, wait, I want the one I had already. Oh, well, OK."
"(CUT to hallway of Paris, Doyle and Rory's apartment, morning. Rory come up the stairs and stops as she notices something in front of their door. She goes over to pick it up as she nods her head disapprovingly. It's a vase of flowers. She unlocks the door)"
"(CUT to inside apartment, continuous. Paris is working on something in flower filled apartment as Rory enters. Paris notices the flowers)"
"PARIS: Oh, terrific. Bring 'em on in, Algernon. The more, the merrier."
"RORY: It's Logan's doing. What can I do? (starts to chain the door)"
"PARIS: Tell him to stop."
"RORY: We're not speaking, remember?"
"PARIS: Well, they're putting our lives in jeopardy."
"RORY: Oh, stop it. (walks in the apartment)"
"PARIS: They scream bling, draw eyes to the apartment. Bad guys see roses, then they come for our diamonds."
"RORY: We don't have diamonds."
"PARIS: The Doo-Wop group doesn't know that. (as Rory is about to put the vase near the window) Yeah, by the window is good, next to the neon sign that says ""come p*stol us""."
"RORY: Fine, I'll hide them. (puts the flowers on the floor)"
"PARIS: You know, I see Logan at the paper a few times a week. I can lean on him, make him stop."
"RORY: He's going to get the message eventually."
"PARIS: Well, he better get it quick. Between the paper and classes, I'm only home a few hours a day, and I'd rather not spend them in mortal fear. (there is a knock on the door and Paris instinctively takes cover)"
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: (to the person outside) Yeah?"
"MAN (OS outside the door): UPS. Got a package for Rory Gilmore."
"PARIS: From?"
"MAN (OS outside the door): Harry and David."
"PARIS: Great. Fancy fruit."
"RORY: I'm sorry. (Paris walks over to the door)"
"PARIS: Step back from the door and keep your hands where I can see them. (starts to unchain the door)"
"(CUT to outside park, morning. The place is covered with snow. There are few people there. Two guys are throwing a frisbee around, as Luke walks up to April who's sitting on a bench her bike and bike helmet nearby)"
"LUKE: Surprise."
"APRIL: Was this not a planned thing?"
"LUKE: Why?"
"APRIL: You said, ""surprise""."
"LUKE: No, it was just...just a...how you doing? (extends his hand for a shake)"
"APRIL: Good. (she takes it and they shake hands) This is how the avian flu spreads, by the way."
"LUKE: Oh, sorry! (quickly takes his hand away)"
"APRIL: I was just saying."
"LUKE: No, I heard that, too. Heard a guy on CNN say it."
"APRIL: Right. They fired my favourite, Aaron Brown. He was comforting."
"LUKE: Yes, he was. Mind if I sit?"
"APRIL: No, go ahead. (Luke sits next to her. There is an awkward silence) So...do you like to hang out here?"
"LUKE: The park? No."
"APRIL: Then why are we meeting here?"
"LUKE: I thought kids liked parks."
"APRIL: It's 41 degrees out. Not exactly peak park-going season."
"LUKE: But there's still stuff to do, right? I mean, we could have a snowball fight, or something."
"APRIL: My friend Remi got into a snowball fight with a guy once, and she got a retina detached."
"LUKE: Well, we'll skip that, then. Uh...sorry. I'll think of something better to do next time, OK? I don't really know what kids are into."
"APRIL: Hey, whatever."
"LUKE: Oh, and I said ""next time"". I don't know if you caught that."
"APRIL: I did."
"LUKE: Did your mom explain that this isn't necessarily a one-time thing? I was thinking maybe we could make it semi-regular or even just, you know, regular."
"APRIL: Uh, OK."
"LUKE: Good. So, what's your free time like?"
"APRIL: I've got no school this whole week. It's year-round, so we get weird times off."
"LUKE: Well, then maybe we can do something tomorrow, too, something less cold."
"APRIL: OK."
"LUKE: So, what kind of things do you like to do?"
"APRIL: I like Morse code. I'm learning that. My mom gave me a putter, so I putt some. And I like talking to my Indian friend Shamilah in Bangalore over the internet."
"LUKE: I wouldn't be much help with any of that. We could bowl, or go to a movie, or maybe there's a zoo around somewhere."
"APRIL: How about I just come and hang out at the diner?"
"LUKE: (shocked and nervous) What diner? My diner?"
"APRIL: Yeah."
"LUKE: Won't it be boring?"
"APRIL: No way. (Luke does not look pleased) Diners fascinate me. The hustle, the bustle, the monte cristos."
"LUKE: The diner?"
"APRIL: Yeah, that'd be fun."
"LUKE: Can't think of anything else, huh?"
"APRIL: I think it'd be great."
"LUKE: Well, OK, sure. The diner. Tomorrow you will come to the diner. (he chuckles nervously and clears his throat) So, uh, what do you want to do right now?"
"APRIL: I've been counting how many times those frisbee guys over there have dropped it."
"LUKE: Uuh, OK. Let's keep watching."
"APRIL: The one with the hat's a big, fat butterfingers. (they watch the guys playing frisbee)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn, morning. Lorelai is signing some papers and having a conversation with Kirk)"
"LORELAI: Kirk, you needed carnival-game volunteers and I volunteered. What's with the hassle?"
"KIRK: We do things like ring toss and rope ladder climbing. Your choice is unorthodox."
"LORELAI: That's because I'm not orthodox. I'm liberal with a touch of reform and a smidgen of zippity-pow."
"KIRK: You're aware that this is the first time I'm running the winter carnival?"
"LORELAI: I am aware. (they start walking to the reception desk)"
"KIRK: I can't afford to have anything go wrong."
"LORELAI: Kirk, I promise! This booth will be a big hit. It will not embarrass you, OK? I promise."
"KIRK: Your promise means nothing to me. You break them all the time."
"LORELAI: (gasps) I do not."
"KIRK: 1997, you promised to bring me back a souvenir pen and ink set from your trip to Colonial Williamsburg."
"LORELAI: I...I did?"
"KIRK: 1999, you promised to put in a good word for me at Al's Pancake World when Al had that batter boy opening."
"LORELAI: He calls them ""batter boys""?"
"KIRK: Year 2000, you promised to teach me to swim. I still don't know how to swim. What if there's a tsunami?"
"LORELAI: Well..."
"KIRK: 2001, you promised to come to my birthday party, and I waited and waited and..."
"LORELAI: Kirk! Kirk, scout's honour, this booth will make you proud, OK? (as they enter the reception desk area Lorelai notices someone waiting) Now...excuse me, hi. Are you Liam Driessen by any chance?"
"LIAM: I am."
"LORELAI: Hi, Lorelai Gilmore. I'm here to make your stay and the rest of the New England Maple Syrup Council's stay as comfortable as possible."
"LIAM: So far, so good. Love the local colour here."
"LORELAI: (noticing Kirk who's followed her and is standing close to them) Uh, Kirk, it's really not appropriate to be standing right next to me like this."
"KIRK: But we work together."
"LORELAI: But not here."
"KIRK: Liam, can I ask you a question?"
"LORELAI: NO that's inappropriate too to ask a quest..."
"KIRK: Would you pay a dollar to have your fortune told by a dog?"
"LIAM: A dog?"
"LORELAI: It's for a carnival. It's very cute."
"KIRK: A dog that has no previous experience telling people's fortunes?"
"LIAM: I don't know."
"KIRK: Well, you're no help. (walks away)"
"LORELAI: Well, just part of our local colour. He's purple. (nervously laughs a bit) Get it? 'Cause local colour and he's a colour. And how about a tour?"
"LIAM: Sure. (they exit)"
"(CUT to Yale Daily News room, morning. The staffers are working, while Paris walks around inspecting)"
"PARIS: That's what we got?"
"JOHNIE: Yup."
"PARIS: It's posed, staged. Get another and make it candid."
"JOHNIE: Candid?"
"PARIS: Don't question me. (walks away and moves over to another desk)"
"JOHNIE: But it's a team photo."
"PARIS: Bill, how's it hangin'?"
"BILL: It's hanging OK."
"PARIS: Good, good. You like the Washington Post, do you?"
"BILL: Yes."
"PARIS: Because they like to split their infinitives, at the Washington Post, especially their metro writers, but I don't."
"BILL: I'm not seeing..."
"PARIS: (reading from his computer screen) ""The council member chose to forcefully waive her right of veto""."
"BILL: (deleting the sentence) Consider it unsplit."
"(Paris walks over to another desk, where a staffer is typing something. Paris pushes her aside and types something of her own, then turns to Rory who's getting ready to leave)"
"PARIS: Hey. You check in?"
"RORY: Check in?"
"PARIS: The board. The new system? This is the best way for me to know where anyone is at any given time. (they walk over to a board near the door) All the names are on the left. Each coloured magnet represents an activity. If you're out on assignment, it's a red magnet. If you're in the john, it's a blue magnet. If you're at home, a purple magnet. If you're at your desk, it's a green magnet."
"RORY: But if they're at their desk, you can just glance over and see that they're at their desks."
"PARIS: But I'd have to glance all around. This saves extraneous glancing. Look, it's not really for people like you. I know you're dedicated. I trust you, but I can't appear to be playing favourites."
"RORY: I have a class."
"PARIS: Orange magnet. (Rory takes the magnet and puts in on the board next to her name. Paris looks pleased and Rory exits)"
"(CUT to Yale hallway, continuous. Rory has just exited the newsroom. Her way is blocked by a coffee cart)"
"RORY: (to coffee cart vender, Ben) Excuse me."
"BEN: You're Rory Gilmore?"
"RORY: Yes."
"BEN: Someone pointed you out to me. This is for you. (pointing at the coffee cart)"
"RORY: What is?"
"BEN: The coffee cart."
"RORY: For me?"
"BEN: Courtesy of Logan Huntzberger."
"RORY: Oh, I see. Well, I don't want any coffee right now. (bypasses the coffee cart) Thanks anyway, and sorry you wasted your time, Ben. (starts to walk away)"
"BEN: No problem. (Ben follows her, with the coffee cart. Rory notices)"
"RORY: What are you doing?"
"BEN: I'm hired for the day."
"RORY: What?"
"BEN: Yep, all day. Any time you want some coffee, biscotti, I will be here."
"RORY: That's not necessary."
"BEN: I've already been paid...a lot!"
"RORY: (sighs) Fine. (starts to walk and Ben follows her with the coffee cart)"
"(CUT to Nardini house, night. Anna is sorting some stuff, probably for her store as we hear a TV in the backround)"
"ANNA: Kiddo, is that the TV?"
"APRIL (OS): Yes."
"ANNA: You watching something stupid?"
"APRIL (OS): Yes."
"ANNA: You promise?"
"APRIL (OS): Yes."
"ANNA: OK. (the telephone rings and Anna picks it up) Hello?"
"LUKE (on phone): Hi, Anna. It's Luke."
"ANNA: Hey there. So, she came back with all her fingers and toes. Very successful first outing."
"LUKE (on phone): Yeah, it was nice. It was...it was real nice."
"ANNA: She had a good time, too. And that's impressive 'cause she's picky."
"LUKE (on phone): Good. Well, so did I."
"ANNA: So, she's coming by your work tomorrow?"
"(CUT to Luke's apartment, continuous. The scene cuts between Luke's apartment and Anna at her house)"
"LUKE: Oh, she told you that, huh? Uh...Well, listen, here's the thing. I don't know if...it's gonna work out for her to come to the diner."
"ANNA: Why not?"
"LUKE: Well, it's gonna be really hectic, lots of people swooshing around and all."
"ANNA: She'll like that. She likes people swooshing around her."
"LUKE: Pans of hot grease."
"ANNA: There'll be pans of hot grease swooshing around her?"
"LUKE: If she's in the kitchen, yeah."
"ANNA: Well, keep her out of the kitchen if there's any grease swooshing. I mean, that doesn't sound safe for you, either."
"LUKE: I don't even know how much time I can give her."
"ANNA: No problem. She's very low-maintenance. Just set her up at a table and she'll be fine."
"LUKE: If there's a table, because some of the tables are reserved. I've got my regulars, you know? They want their tables, so there may not be room."
"ANNA: She's little. You'll find room."
"LUKE: You know, Anna, actually, I don't...I don't know if, uh, tomorrow is gonna be good at all for anything. I didn't realize how busy I was. Factor in all the people swooshing and the grease swooshing."
"ANNA: Luke, no."
"LUKE: ""No"" what?"
"ANNA: It doesn't work that way."
"LUKE: What do you mean?"
"ANNA: Look, I don't know what the problem is here."
"LUKE: What are you talking about?"
"ANNA: You say you're available one minute, and the next minute you're not?"
"LUKE: I told you, I was just..."
"ANNA: It's not cool, Luke. It's not happening this way."
"LUKE: What way? It's just a bad time."
"ANNA: There's no great time to be a parent, Luke, you just are one. And if you're gonna make plans with my kid and get her hopes up and then cancel, then our deal is cancelled."
"LUKE: Anna, no."
"ANNA: Yes, that's it. That's how it works. You're either all-in or you're all-out. We didn't ask for this. You did. You wanted contact, a relationship, and now..."
"LUKE: OK, OK, I hear ya. Have her come to the diner tomorrow."
"ANNA: You're sure?"
"LUKE: I'm sure. I was just over thinking all of this. I'll see her tomorrow."
"ANNA: OK, she will be there."
"LUKE: Good. Thanks. It'll be good."
"ANNA: It better be. Bye, Luke. (hangs up)"
"LUKE: Bye. (hangs up too)"
"(CUT to Rich Man's Shoe, evening. The Daily News staffers are sitting at table talking as Rory enters the pub, notices them and approaches)"
"AK: She's starting to go through trash cans. It's creepy."
"BILL: That's a privacy violation, for God's sake."
"SHEILA: What's she looking for?"
"AK: (notices Rory) Uh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh."
"RORY: (coming up to their table) Hi, guys."
"AK: Hey, Rory."
"RORY: Did I interrupt something? (the staffers look uncomfortable)"
"AK: No, no, nothing much. Just hangin'."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"AK: Nothing. Just enjoying a tipple."
"RORY: So all the senior staffers from the Yale Daily News are simultaneously enjoying a tipple?"
"JOHNIE: Tell her."
"AK: No."
"JOHNIE: Tell her!"
"RORY: Tell me what?"
"AK: This is a w*r council."
"RORY: About what?"
"BILL: About Kaiser Geller and her reign of terror."
"SHEILA: The paper is going to crap."
"JOHNIE: It's unreadable."
"BILL: She rewrites our stuff, then rewrites her rewrites."
"JOHNIE: And to add insult to injury, the copy gets worse every time."
"SHEILA: She used to be good, right? Wasn't Paris good at one point?"
"AK: Before she was editor."
"BILL: Now she's Augusto Pinochet in a pantsuit."
"SHEILA: Yeah, what's up with those pantsuits?"
"JOHNIE: We're seriously considering Howell-Raines-ing her."
"RORY: You want to force her out?"
"AK: She's out of control."
"RORY: And you have the authority?"
"SHEILA: We're the board."
"BILL: And the board has the authority."
"RORY: I'm a senior staffer, too. Why wasn't I asked to be here tonight?"
"BILL: You're in Paris's pocket."
"RORY: I am not in Paris's pocket."
"JOHNIE: You're friends."
"SHEILA: Best friends, right? That's what Paris is always saying."
"JOHNIE: And you guys live together. It didn't seem appropriate."
"RORY: OK, let me set the record straight. I'm devoted to the paper, OK? Personal feelings cannot get in the way of things. Paris and I are not best friends. We're friends, for the most part, and I'm not immune to being driven crazy by her, believe me."
"JOHNIE: Oh, we believe you."
"SHEILA: I'm getting crow's-feet. I'm sorry, Paris Geller is not going to give me crow's-feet."
"AK: So you do acknowledge a problem here?"
"RORY: I just did, AK. Where's the trust, dude?"
"AK: We just want to do this right."
"RORY: Well, then, let's talk and maybe set the Howell-Raines-ing aside for now. Let's see if we can fix things before we blow them up."
"AK: Fine. Sit."
"BILL: But allow us our cathartic purging."
"RORY: Purge away. (Ben approaches the table and clears his throat) Oh, but first would anyone like a refreshing coffee beverage? I have Ben till nine."
"STAFFER GUY 1: Well I'll have a decaf latte."
"BILL: Same here."
"JOHNIE: Can he do mocha latte?"
"RORY: He does a great mocha latte."
"JOHNIE: Oh, I'll have a mocha latte."
"TALLIE: I will too."
"(CUT to Stars Hollow outside, morning. Lorelai is walking down the street, looking through some mail-envelopes as she bumps into someone dressed in a sweat suit, with the hood on and wearing sunglasses...Taylor)"
"LORELAI: Uhh! Sorry. Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Shh!"
"LORELAI: What are you doing back? I thought you were stranded at your sister's."
"TAYLOR: Lorelai, please. (starts to push her back in an alley)"
"LORELAI: Weird time for line dancing."
"TAYLOR: Fine. OK, I'm back. I got lucky last night and caught a plane out of Maine."
"LORELAI: Even with the rain in Spain?"
"TAYLOR: Will you be serious for second?"
"LORELAI: What's with the sweats?"
"TAYLOR: I'm incognito. Don't you see? With the carnival coming up, this is my Huckleberry-Finn opportunity to observe things invisibly. You know, I'm not gonna be around forever, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, Taylor, are you sick?"
"TAYLOR: No, just mortal. And eventually someone, maybe Kirk, is going to have to take over the many delicate tasks I perform for this town. The streetlamp illumination monitoring, the lawn-height measuring."
"LORELAI: Now I'm just getting sad."
"TAYLOR: Please keep my secret."
"LORELAI: Mum's the word."
"TAYLOR: Well, I should go."
"LORELAI: Back to 8 mile?"
"TAYLOR: What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. Ooh, behind you. (as she notices some passers-by, Taylor covers up a bit more. They kinda wave each other goodbye and Taylor walks way. Lorelai looks on a bit amused and then starts to leave to)"
"(CUT to Town Square, continuous. Workers are fixing up the square for the carnival. Zach, as one of the workers, carries a box with stuff and sets it down as Lorelai greats him. He's in a mood)"
"LORELAI: Hey, Zach. You helping out?"
"ZACH: Got to keep body and soul together."
"LORELAI: Well, this is space 18 and that's my booth, so we're a team."
"ZACH: We should get uniforms."
"LORELAI: You OK?"
"ZACH: Yeah, I'm great. I lost my girlfriend, my band's broken up, my best friend won't speak to me, and I'm reduced to working as a five-dollar-an-hour carny. Bob Dylan should write a song about me."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry about you and Lane."
"ZACH: Yeah, well..."
"LORELAI: But you'll get through this rough patch and life will move on. Trust me. It's human nature to move on."
"ZACH: What?!"
"LORELAI: What ""what""?"
"ZACH: Are you saying Lane's moved on?"
"LORELAI: No!"
"ZACH: Have you seen her with someone else?"
"LORELAI: No, no, no! I'm just saying people have the ability to move on."
"ZACH: Oh, my God, God, God. (hold his head in his hands in frustration) I got to go take a break. (walks away)"
"LORELAI: OK. (calling after him) Hope I cheered you up some. (turns and looks at the booth next to hers. She gasps as she sees it's the fortune-tellers booth) Kirk? Kirk!"
"KIRK: Yes, Lorelai? (walks up to her holding his clipboard)"
"LORELAI: Why are you putting the exact same booth right next to my booth?"
"KIRK: Well, frankly, I have my doubts about your dog's ability to predict the future."
"LORELAI: You have your doubts?"
"KIRK: Yes, and in order to satisfy our guests, I'm hedging our bets by putting the real thing next door so that no one walks away bamboozled."
"LORELAI: Kirk, there is no real thing. It's all fake. Those tarot cards are not real. My dog cannot predict the future."
"KIRK: So you admit it?"
"LORELAI: I was never hiding it."
"KIRK: That's fraud."
"LORELAI: It's a Doggy Swami."
"KIRK: My girlfriend says tarot cards are real."
"LORELAI: Well, I like your girlfriend, but the cards are no more real than my dog. (her cell phone starts to ring and she reaches to her purse to get it) I got to take this, but I would like it if you would move the...(Kirk walks away from her as she answers the phone) Kirk? Kirk?!"
"LUKE (on phone): No, it's me."
"LORELAI: No, I know it's you. I just was getting frustrated with Kirk."
"(CUT to Luke's diner, continuous. Scene cuts between Lorelai outside and Luke at the diner)"
"LUKE: What else is new? So, um... I was wondering what your time was like today."
"LORELAI: My time?"
"LUKE: Because there's something I need to run past you."
"LORELAI: Oh, I have a minute now."
"LUKE: I'd like to discuss it in person."
"LORELAI: Oh, could it wait till tonight? 'Cause I have the syrup council in town and they've got a conference and a meal and Josh is out sick and Jamie's out sick and I just barely got away to come here and get in an argument with Kirk about what's more legitimate. Tarot cards or a fortune-telling dog."
"LUKE: So you're not coming by the diner?"
"LORELAI: Not today, but I'm totally yours tonight. Is that OK?"
"LUKE: Uh, sure. So you definitely won't be coming by the diner today?"
"LORELAI: Not today, sorry."
"LUKE: No, it's OK. Just if you were coming by, I wanted to know. And now I know you're not."
"LORELAI: Right."
"LUKE: OK, so give Kirk hell and I guess I'll see you tonight."
"LORELAI: OK, see you tonight. (She hangs up, as Zach comes up to her holding some stuff) Hey, Zach, did you see where Kirk went?"
"ZACH: (pointing) Thataway. (Lorelai walks off, to the direction that he pointed, and Zach notices something. It's Mrs.Kim talking pleasantly to a relatively young, charming Korean man, Joe)"
"Mrs.KIM: Lane will be right here for the carnival. Six o'clock sharp."
"JOE: Wonderful. Well, keep warm and tell Lane I'll see her later."
"Mrs.KIM: All right. Bye now. (Joe walks away and leaves Mrs.Kim with a smile on her face, as Zach looks on quite sad)"

"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Luke is clearing up a table, as April rides her bike up to the diner and starts to talk to the postman. Luke notices her from inside, walks over to the door and goes outside)"
"LUKE: April."
"APRIL: Hi, Luke."
"LUKE: Get in here."
"APRIL: Bye, now. (waves the postman goodbye and she starts walking to the diner)"
"LUKE: What are you doing talking to him? (as they enter the diner)"
"APRIL: He asked about my bike."
"LUKE: You don't talk to him, you don't know him. He could be a strangler."
"APRIL: He seemed to know you."
"LUKE: Yeah, of course. That's Jake. I've known him fifteen years."
"APRIL: You've known a strangler for fifteen years?"
"LUKE: He's not a strangler."
"APRIL: Then why can't I talk to him?"
"LUKE: Because you didn't know that. Don't trust anyone, OK? Anyone."
"APRIL: OK (puts her bike helmet on the counter), then I should go lock my bike. (starts to exit but Luke stops her)"
"LUKE: No, you don't have to lock it."
"APRIL: You just said I can't trust anyone."
"LUKE: You don't have to lock your bike. This is a safe town."
"APRIL: Well, I'm confused."
"LUKE: (exhales uncomfortably) So...here it is."
"APRIL: I know. We met here."
"LUKE: Right, right. So, what do you want to do? Sit and color?"
"APRIL: Color? (chuckles a bit) Wow. I haven't colored in six or seven years. But that takes me back. Coloring. Wow."
"LUKE: OK, so you don't color. Did you bring a book?"
"APRIL: I don't really feel like reading."
"LUKE: Well, I don't really have any toys or anything."
"APRIL: (looks around a bit) Your salt and pepper shakers look a little low."
"LUKE: Yes, they are. People salt stuff too much."
"APRIL: Can I refill them?"
"LUKE; You want to refill the salt shakers?"
"APRIL: And the pepper. And possibly the sugar...we'll see how the salt and pepper goes."
"LUKE: Oh, well, OK. Refill the salt and pepper? Whatever. I'll get the boxes."
"APRIL: Great."
"LUKE: Great. (Luke starts to walk to the kitchen as April sits on a stool at the counter. They both chuckle, and Luke exits to the back)"
"APRIL: (wistfully) Coloring."
"(CUT to Dragonfly Inn dinning room, morning. The New England Maple Syrup Council are having their meeting. Liam is in charge as Lorelai and Sookie look on. The council seem to be tasting straight syrup)"
"LIAM: Well, it may surprise some of you, but that's a syrup derived from a black maple. Yes, it's sweeter than the first two, but it's a natural sweetness with a hint of orange. Very unusual and very good. Let's move on to number four, shall we? And number four is another little surprise."
"LORELAI: Ugh, gives my skin that weird, tingly feel like something's bubbling underneath it."
"SOOKIE: It makes the root of my tongue feel like it's retracting back into my throat."
"LORELAI: What don't they pour it on something. A waffle, a pancake?"
"LIAM: So, let's go ahead and taste number four, shall we? Then we'll talk. (they sip)"
"LORELAI: Ew!"
"SOOKIE: Ew, drinking straight syrup!"
"LORELAI: We don't have to watch this."
"SOOKIE: It's hard not to."
"LIAM: A bit of a tobacco taste to it and a bit of marshmallow."
"SOOKIE: Oh, good. Now I can't smoke a cigar or eat a marshmallow again."
"LORELAI: How does one discover a talent for this?"
"LIAM: Remember, for anyone who wants one, we have spit buckets. (takwes the buckets out an starts to pass them around)"
"SOOKIE: That's it."
"LORELAI: See ya. (they walk away)"
"(CUT to Dragonfly in sitting-room area, continuous. Lorelai passes by and notices Logan sitting and waiting for her. HE sighs as he sees her)"
"LOGAN: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hello."
"LOGAN: I was gonna call you, but then I figured you wouldn't take the call."
"LORELAI: (walks up to him) Yeah, you figured right."
"LOGAN: I just need a minute."
"LORELAI: I can't fathom what a minute of my time is gonna do for you."
"LOGAN: Just a minute, please, then I am gone."
"LORELAI: OK. (they sit)"
"LOGAN: Look, I know I'm not your favorite person in the world."
"LORELAI: No, you're definitely low on the list, right above the guy who thought up smallpox blankets."
"LOGAN: Well, in my defense, I think I'm a notch or two higher than that."
"LORELAI: You're not exactly in a position to comment on that, are you?"
"LOGAN: No."
"LORELAI: No. In fact, let's take inventory of all the delightful things that have happened since you waltzed into my daughter's life. She was arrested, convicted, she's on probation, she'll have a criminal record unless we can get it expunged, she dropped out of school, moved out of my house, she didn't speak to me for five months, three weeks, and sixteen days. No, wait a minute. Come to think of it, you are my favorite person."
"LOGAN: OK, I can defend myself on one or two of those points as well."
"LORELAI: No, you can't. Why are you here?"
"LOGAN: I miss her, OK? I made a mistake and I'm trying to rectify it, but nothing is working. She won't talk to me."
"LORELAI: Can you blame her?"
"LOGAN: No. I'm doing everything I can. Flowers, gifts."
"LORELAI: All your old standbys, huh?"
"LOGAN: Books, coffee cart. I'm trying to show her how I feel."
"LORELAI: And it sounds like she's trying to show you how she feels."
"LOGAN: Look, I figured this was a su1c1de mission, OK? It's probably something you and Rory will laugh about for years to come. But I'm not giving up until I exhaust all my options, and asking for your help is one of them."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LOGAN: Yes."
"LORELAI: You're seriously here to ask for my help with Rory? This is not a joke?"
"LOGAN: I'm going for broke here."
"LORELAI: Well...you got moxie, my friend, I'll give you that."
"LOGAN: I think I get it from my dad."
"LORELAI: I hate your dad."
"LOGAN: Me too. See? We have things in common, you and me. Maybe this isn't so crazy."
"(CUT to Luke's diner, morning. Lorelai enters the diner and notices April filling up the salt shakers. She approaches her)"
"LORELAI: Oh, hi."
"APRIL: Hello there."
"LORELAI: Oh, what are...what are you doing?"
"APRIL: Chores."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I see."
"APRIL: Are you a strangler?"
"LORELAI: No, no."
"APRIL: Just checking. (Lorelai laughs a bit and April takes in her hands a bow of rice) Rice. That's the key. Prevents clumping."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I hate clumpy salt."
"APRIL: That's universal."
"LORELAI: So, who do you belong to. Caesar?"
"APRIL: Who?"
"LORELAI: You're not Caesar's?"
"APRIL: Not according to the lab results."
"LORELAI: Well, how'd you land the gig?"
"APRIL: My father owns the place. The diner, at least. Not sure about the land."
"LORELAI: Your father?"
"APRIL: My biological father. (Luke comes out from the kitchen and notices the scene taking place) Not really sure what to call him, it's kind of new. (Lorelai sees him too and they look at each other. Lorelai looks upset. Luke looks uncomfortable) Not the biological part, that was years ago. I wonder if brown rice would work, too. Brown might be more decorative or it might backfire. People might think there are bugs in the salt. I should put some brown rice in one of the shakers and use it as a control group against the other ones."
"LUKE: I thought you couldn't get away."
"LORELAI: I got away."
"APRIL: She said she wasn't a strangler."
"LUKE: Uh, you want to go outside and uh...?"
"LORELAI: Uh-huh. (walks outside)"
"LUKE: April, I'll be right back, OK?"
"APRIL: OK. (Luke follows Lorelai outside)"
"(CUT to Stars Hollow outside Luke's, continuous. Lorelai is standing there waiting as Luke exits and walks up to her)"
"LORELAI: So she's..."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Wow."
"LUKE: I know."
"LORELAI: That's..."
"LUKE: My daughter."
"LORELAI: I don't believe it."
"LUKE: I still have trouble believing it."
"LORELAI: You have a..."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Right. And what is she, twelve?"
"LUKE: Yeah, twelve."
"LORELAI: Twelve years. Twelve years! This is for sure?"
"LUKE: It's for sure."
"LORELAI: When did you find out?"
"LUKE: I just found out."
"LORELAI: Just? When just? She's in there filling salt shakers. It doesn't feel that new to me."
"LUKE: Two months ago."
"LORELAI: Two months?! That's a hell of a long time to go without telling me."
"LUKE: I know. I should've told you."
"LORELAI: She's cute."
"LUKE: Lorelai, I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry. It's all just a blur of stuff happening. I mean, she just came into the diner two months ago, no warning, talking about a science fair and how I may be her father, and she pulled my hair out and DNA-tested it, and then I wanted to forget the whole thing, but I went to the fair and found out the truth. And we were at the park, and she wanted to come here. And I called you today, wanting a moment to talk about it, but you were busy, and...so I put it off again. And here we are."
"LORELAI: Here we are."
"LUKE: It's stupid. I'm stupid."
"LORELAI: Look...I need to digest this and you have to get back inside. So, uh, I'm just gonna go someplace where I can digest this and we'll just talk more later, OK?"
"LUKE: Sure. Whenever you want."
"LORELAI: OK."
"LUKE: I'm sorry. (Lorelai sadly nods and walks away. Luke doesn't seem to pleased with himself)"
"(CUT to Yale Daily News, morning. All staffers are wearing caps with numbers on them while doing their work. Rory enters notices and approaches Johnie?s office)"
"RORY: ""What's up with the caps"", she asked, knowing it's probably not good."
"JOHNIE: It's Paris. She's having trouble remembering everyone's names, or as she puts it, she has more important things to do with her brain."
"RORY: Oh, geez"
"JOHNIE: Plus some of us have confused the issue by having the same first name. The three Johns?, the two Marthas?. So she's issued numbers."
"RORY: Oh, geez"
"BILL: Martinet at three o'clock."
"PARIS: (coming out form her cubicle and approaching a staffer) Nice job on Bienecki map theft article, number seventeen."
"NUMBER 17: Thanks, Paris."
"PARIS: Twenty-three and eighty, I need your stuff by five. (notices Rory) Ah, Rory! New system. Here's your number. (passes her a cap)"
"RORY: Paris, you know me. I don't need a number and I'm the only Rory."
"PARIS: But you don't want me to play favorites, do you? we talked about this."
"RORY: So we all have numbers?"
"PARIS: Including me. I'm number one. Don't need a cap for that. If they can't remember the number one, they shouldn't be here."
"RORY: Hey, can we talk in a little more private place?"
"PARIS: Sure. (they start to walk outside) If you're looking for 1 and 2, we'll be in the hallway."
"(CUT to outside hallway, continuous)"
"RORY: Paris, the atmosphere here, it's getting a little toxic."
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Everyone here is very stressed. The greaseboard, the hats."
"PARIS: I haven't heard any complaints."
"RORY: That's because people are afraid to approach you. You rewrite everything they do. You don't delegate."
"PARIS: That's not true."
"RORY: Look, the staff and I had a little talk yesterday. It was very impromptu. I won't get into the hairy details, but it would really help if you could relieve some of the pressure here."
"PARIS: They think it's that bad?"
"RORY: You've taken away the magnets that indicate people are in the bathroom, so now they're afraid to go."
"PARIS: Well, they were going too much."
"RORY: People are getting very nervous here."
"PARIS: Yeah, I see. I'll go talk to them. Thanks for bringing it to my attention."
"RORY: You're welcome. (they walk back in the office)"
"(CUT to Yale Daily News, continuous. Paris claps to get the staff's attention)"
"PARIS: Where's seventy-three and thirty-two? (the staffers gather around) People, Rory Gilmore has just informed me of the meeting held behind my back concerning my stewardship of the paper."
"RORY: Oh, Paris."
"PARIS: Am I tough? You're damn right I'm tough. You think it's going to be any easier entering the work force with every newspaper in the country cutting back on staff? Also, any chance that you'd attempt the same sort of flaccid coup if I were a man? I think not. You're trying to Howell Raines me? Well, forget it. Suck it up and get to work! Otherwise, there's the door. (Paris walks off. Rory resigned puts her cap on as a few of the staffers don't look that pleased with her)"
"(CUT to hallway of Paris, Doyle and Rory's apartment. Rory comes up the stairs and notices Logan waiting for her outside the apartment holding a take out box)"
"LOGAN: I come bearing gifts."
"RORY: I have to unlock the door."
"LOGAN: You can't say no to these. I know you. It's biologically impossible. (opens the box - doughnuts - for Rory to see)"
"RORY: Oh, yeah? (looks at the content of the box) No."
"LOGAN: (as he closes the box and point to the locks) That seems very cumbersome."
"RORY: You get used to it."
"LOGAN: You get the coffee cart?"
"RORY: You really think we're gonna chitchat?"
"LOGAN: I just wanted to know."
"RORY: Yeah, I got it. And the flowers and the books and the candles and the fruit. What's next on the list? A marching band? A parrot who says ""I'm sorry""? You have to go."
"LOGAN: Wait. (takes out an envelope and holds it up for Rory to see)"
"RORY: What's that, a subpoena?"
"LOGAN: It's a note from your mother."
"RORY: You're kidding."
"LOGAN: Check out the handwriting, Dragonfly stationery. Can we get out of the hallway? (Rory kicks door the door and opens it)"
"(CUT to inside apartment, continuous. They enter)"
"LOGAN: I went to see her at her inn. We talked a little. It was a tad humiliating. She told me to wait and she came back with this. She said to give it to you."
"RORY: What's it say?"
"LOGAN: I was instructed not to read it. She even signed the seal on the envelope to make sure."
"RORY: You have no idea what this says?"
"LOGAN: None. (Rory opens the envelope and starts to read) What's it say?"
"RORY: Shh. (she smiles)"
"LOGAN: What's it say?"
"RORY: Shh! (chuckles)"
"LOGAN: What does it say?"
"RORY: Shh!"
"LOGAN: Come on, Ace, you're laughing. Is that good or bad?"
"RORY: Hmm. Yep. Yep. (laughs)"
"LOGAN: Just give me some indication whether it's good or bad. Something, anything. (Rory stops reading and laughing and is silent) OK, fine. Just tell me. Is there anything in there about giving me a second chance?"
"RORY: I'd have to reread it."
"LOGAN: Please don't do that, Ace, come on. Come out with me. Let me make it up to you."
"RORY: Maybe dinner."
"LOGAN: When?"
"RORY: I'll have to check my schedule."
"LOGAN: Check it."
"RORY: I can't do it right now."
"LOGAN: So?"
"RORY: I'll call you."
"LOGAN: Good enough. Good enough. You promise you'll call?"
"RORY: Leave the doughnuts. (takes the box form him and Logan exits,. She sits on a chair opens the box takes a doughnut and starts to re-read a letter. She chuckles a bit as she reads)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's house night. Lorelai is in the kitchen taking take-out food out of a brown paper bag looking sad. We hear the door. It's Rory)"
"RORY (OS): Margaret, I'm home."
"LORELAI: Kitchen."
"RORY: And I come bearing gifts. Laundry galore. Oh, and I've got some candles and some fancy fruit, too. (she comes in the kitchen loaded with stuff) I don't know who Harry and David are, but they sure do know how to grow a pear. (groans a bit as she carries her stuff in her room) So, your letter? Oh, my God. It was brilliant. It has got to be anthologized. I'm telling you. And he definitely did not read it because he looked flummoxed. (Lorelai sits on a chair and hold her face in her hands) Flummoxed! The whole time I was reading it, and I didn't tell him a thing about it. That's what he gets. So, come on. I want to hear all about his visit with you. (Rory comes back out to the kitchen and notices Lorelai) Mom?"
"LORELAI: Luke has a daughter."
"RORY: And we'll talk about the letter later. What!? (walks over to the table and sits next to Lorelai)"
"LORELAI: He has a twelve-year-old daughter. I met her today, well I didn't formally meet her, but I saw and I talked to her."
"RORY: What?!"
"LORELAI: He has a daughter with some woman. We didn't get to that, the big who, but he's known for two months."
"RORY: Two months?"
"LORELAI: A daughter."
"RORY: A daughter."
"LORELAI: What does this say about our relationship?"
"RORY: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: He waited two months to tell me."
"RORY: Did he say why he waited?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he said he was confused, and I get that. I mean, I'm confused, but what does it mean that he kept a secret like this? What does it say about him? What does it say about me? Doesn't he trust me? Why doesn't he trust me?"
"RORY: He trusts you, Mom. He's a guy. Sometimes guys are really dumb."
"LORELAI: She's cute."
"RORY: She is?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she seems smart like you. What is it with the next generation? You're all smarter than the rest of us."
"RORY: Not necessarily."
"LORELAI: I'm freaking out."
"RORY: I don't blame you."
"LORELAI: What else is he hiding? I mean, how can you really know that you know somebody?"
"RORY: I don't think you can. Every relationship is just a big, honkin' leap of faith."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I guess."
"RORY: You didn't ask about the mother?"
"LORELAI: I just kinda ran off. I couldn't wrap my mind around it."
"RORY: Well, Luke must be freaked out double what you're freaked out, you know? Mr.Responsibility? He must've put his baseball cap on backwards."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: I'm sure he panicked. I'm sure his not telling you says nothing about your relationship. Maybe this is a cheesy perspective to offer you, but Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale went through the same sort of situation. He found out he had a kid that he didn't know about, but they made it work...as far as I know."
"LORELAI: Meaning?"
"RORY: If they can, you can."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"RORY: They're people. You're people. I mean, you don't sing and neither does Luke, but really, neither do Gwen or Gavin, but they're still together...I think. I haven't read anything to the contrary."
"LORELAI: I guess."
"RORY: You and Luke just need to talk some more."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Maybe I'll tell Luke about Gwen and Gavin. I mean, if there's any people whose lives Luke would relate to, it's Gwen and Gavin. (they start to pass out their take out food as Lorelai sighs)"
"(CUT to Winter Carnival, night. The camera pans all the way through the carnival to end up at Kirk checking some tickets of Megan and Tillie)"
"MEGAN: They only cost fifty cents?"
"TILLIE: Yeah, how lame would it be to go to the trouble of counterfeiting?"
"KIRK: No mind games. They're legit. (he lets the girls pass)"
"TILLIE: Another crime thwarted."
"MEGAN: Good job, Colombo. (As the girls walk away we see Taylor still in disguise inspecting the carnival. He approaches a vender)"
"TAYLOR (in German accent): Guten tag, there. I would like, uh, what you call them?...A hot dog?"
"VENDER: Coming up. (Taylor inspects the cart and stops quickly as the vendor comes back with the hot dog)"
"TAYLOR (in German accent): Ja. Oh, und we are having cold weather this year, nein? (he walks away and the vender looks after him a bit confused)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's booth. Lorelai and Rory are manning their booth)"
"RORY: It's a smashing concept."
"LORELAI: And Kirk was doubtful."
"RORY: We've already raked in eighteen dollars."
"LORELAI: And the night is young."
"RORY: Come on, Doggy Swami, break's over. (Paul Anka climbs up the booth)"
"LORELAI: He is liking his hat."
"RORY: Well, it's very flattering. You know, I can man this myself if you don't feel like being here."
"LORELAI: No, it's good for me. Nothing is a better distraction than a dog in a turban, telling fortunes."
"RORY: It's a cliche for a reason."
"LORELAI: (starts yelling to advertise the booth) Come see the Amazing Doggy Swami. Discover your future..."
"RORY: If you dare."
"LORELAI: It's silly."
"RORY: And fun."
"LORELAI: And real. Very, very real. (stares pointedly at the tarot cards reader on the next booth)"
"(CUT to Mrs.Kim's booth. Lane in manning it)"
"LANE: Congratulations! Nice job! (at new visitor) Want to play? It's only a dollar."
"MAN1: Sure. (he pays and then throws something that Lane gave him in a ?pit? that has cardboard flames on it's edges)"
"LANE: Winner! We have a winner!"
"MAN1: Really? That's it?"
"LANE: That's it. Here's your prize. (hands him a piece of paper as Joe, the Korean young man from before approaches Lane)"
"MAN1: (reads the paper) ""Hell is waiting for you, sinner""."
"LANE: Enjoy. (the Man walks away)"
"LANE: Alright! Who wants to win? Don't be afraid of playing! (we see that Zach is spying on Lane and Joe) Step up and play ""toss the sybarite into the hellfire"". Everybody's a winner!"
"JOE: I'm gonna go take a little walk, check out the competition."
"LANE: Just don't let my mother see you play anything too decadent."
"JOE: I'll be back in a bit. (as Joe leaves, Zach follows him and Lane keeps advertising her booth)"
"LANE: Come on people! Step right up! You can't lose. I'm guaranteeing you a good..."
"(camera pans on Taylor who is inspecting another booth and stops quickly when the vendor notices him and he sees Patty walking towards him)"
"TAYLOR (in French accent): Ahh! Oui! Look at ze games. It is so marvelous that I am 'ere to see it. What a great country. J'adore. (he walks away quickly as Patty and another visitor walk by)"
"PATTY: Taylor finally flipped his lid."
"(CUT to Babette's booth)"
"BABETTE: (at visitor) Yeah, poor Morey couldn't make it. I made him drink thirty bottles of coke last night for the game here, so he's still throwing up. And then I ended up not using 'em. Shame, huh? But I'll tell him you said ""hi"". (The visitor leaves as Babette yells at Joe who's walking by) Hey, want to throw some balls?"
"JOE: (walks up to the booth and pays) Just don't laugh too hard at me."
"BABETTE: Never, never. (gives him the balls) Come on up here. (Zach walks over to the booth all determined)"
"ZACH: Give me some balls."
"BABETTE: Fresh balls coming up."
"(Joe throws once and hits a bottle. Babette applauds, Zach mockingly laughs, throws harder and hits quite a few bottles)"
"ZACH: Yeah!"
"BABETTE: Watch it, honey. It could bounce off the back and hit the girls manning the dime toss. (after Joe's second toss) There you go. You're getting the hang of it."
"ZACH: Yeah, cute little throw."
"JOE: Excuse me?"
"ZACH: Pretty boy says what?"
"JOE: What?"
"(Zach throws the second one much harder)"
"BABETTE: Jeez, Zach, what's with being all goose gossage? (Zach starts to hit Joe's bottles and gets them all) Zach, those aren't your bottles!"
"ZACH: Yeah! Yeah! (in Joe's face) Welcome to the S.H., bitch!"
"JOE: What's your problem?"
"ZACH: I don't got a problem, friend. My problem is I got no more bottles to knock down."
"BABETTE: Who do I give the prize to?"
"ZACH: Give it to Asian George Clooney over here. I'm outtie. (walks away)"
"BABETTE: So, I...I...I got smurfs and dirty pasta."
"(CUT to Taylor checking the cider booth. He has a thermometer to see the cider's temperature. Maggie who's manning the booth notices this)"
"MAGGIE: What'd you just put in there?"
"TAYLOR (in British accent): Nothing, lady."
"MAGGIE: You stuck something in the cider."
"TAYLOR: (in British accent) I did not. (in normal voice) Although if I did, it would be a thermometer and it might indicate that you are on the border of under-heating your cider."
"MAGGIE: Get away from me."
"TAYLOR: Gladly!"
"MAGGIE: Now. Right now."
"(Taylor walks away as the camera pans over at Mrs.Kim's booth. Jo, from the pizza place and the arcade, is tossing the thingy in the ""pit"" and misses)"
"Mrs.KIM: Winner!"
"JO: But I missed."
"Mrs.KIM: Everybody's a winner. (give Jo his price and as he walks away as Zach comes up to the booth)"
"ZACH: Mrs.Kim, I need a word with you."
"Mrs.KIM: I'm busy."
"ZACH: You just couldn't wait to put her on the market again, could you?"
"Mrs.KIM: What are you talking about?"
"ZACH: Who else? Lane! We only broke up a few weeks ago. What? You got her engaged already?"
"Mrs.KIM: Engaged to who?"
"ZACH: To who? (points at Lane and Joe who are talking and laughing) The Korean Brad Pitt guy there with the Italian loafers and super white teeth. He's hanging all over her."
"Mrs.KIM: You mean her uncle?"
"ZACH: What?"
"Mrs.KIM: Joe. He's her uncle."
"ZACH: That can't be her uncle. Uncles are old."
"Mrs.KIM: My mother had me, waited long time, then had him. Joe is my brother."
"ZACH: Whoa, OK. Oops."
"Mrs.KIM: Yes, ""oops""."
"ZACH: But just to be clear here, she's not hot on her uncle? (at Mrs.Kim's stern look) She's not. Got it. Well...sorry. (starts to leave)"
"Mrs.KIM: Wait! You accuse me of something? We settle this now. (walks out for behind the booth and up to Zach)"
"ZACH: All right."
"Mrs.KIM: I am not going to get in your way."
"ZACH: OK. (Mrs.Kim nods and walks away from him. He looks after her a bit stunned and then walks away too)"
"(CUT to Lorelai's booth. It's Lane's turn)"
"LORELAI: Ready?"
"LANE: Ready."
"LORELAI: Spin the wheel. (she spins the wheel, and Paul Anka at some point stops it."
"RORY: The Swami has chosen! (Lorelai takes the note that the swami has chosen)"
"LORELAI: Ready?"
"LANE: This is exciting."
"LORELAI: (reads) ""You will sing songs of gemstones""."
"LANE: Of gemstones!"
"RORY: How do you sing songs of gemstones?"
"LORELAI: Ah, I was a little tired when I wrote this one. Sorry. You want to pick another one? Swami do-overs are allowed."
"LANE: (takes her fortune) No, I'll stick with this one. It's got an air of mystery. (Rory notices Luke walking up to them)"
"RORY: Hey, Luke, want Swami Doggy to read your fortune?"
"LUKE: Uh, maybe some other time. (at Lorelai) Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: Can we walk a little bit?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. (they walk off)"
"(CUT to Luke and Lorelai walking through the fair)"
"LUKE: I've got to apologize again. I should've told you immediately. I was just so confused. It's no excuse, but that's the excuse."
"LORELAI: I know. I get it. Nothing can prepare you for this one."
"LUKE: Yeah. I just didn't know how to tell you. I'm bad with things."
"LORELAI: No, Luke. Listen, it's weird, you know, but we can make it work. I mean, she's there. April is there. Luckily you're with a woman who's raised a daughter and knows some of the ins and outs. I can help."
"LUKE: I know you can. I guess it's just...Uh, it's just all so much right now. I've been dizzy for weeks."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's..."
"LORELAI: I felt like something was up."
"LUKE: All too much, you know?"
"LORELAI: Well, what all? Everything or...?"
"LUKE: Well, I've got a kid. She's here. You know, June 3rd."
"LORELAI: What about June 3rd?"
"LUKE: It's just so soon."
"LORELAI: It's still months away."
"LUKE: Well, it feels close. It's everything, you know? It's all piling up. It's all happening so fast."
"LORELAI: Well, if it's all happening too fast, you know, we can just postpone."
"LUKE: Postpone the wedding?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I mean, it's not set in stone. It just happened to work out for a date that soon. I don't want you going into this all jumbled up, you know?"
"LUKE: And that would be okay with you?"
"LORELAI: Sure."
"LUKE: Well, that'll help. Yeah, that'll really help. That'll give me time to resolve this other thing, and everything will be better later on."
"LORELAI: Well...great, then it's a done deal. (they kiss) Think it might be a health-code violation, kissing this close to the cotton candy booth."
"LUKE: Meet me back at my place later?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, see you there. (they peck on the lips and Luke walks away. Lorelai looks on sadly after him)"

"LORELAI AND LUKE'S BEDROOM"
"[Luke is asleep, Lorelai comes out of the bathroom trying to be quite, the room is only partly lit]"
"LUKE: [half asleep] Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey… did I wake you? 'Cause I brushed my teeth in the shower so you wouldn't hear the sink run."
"LUKE: No, you didn't wake me up."
"LORELAI: But then it occurred to me, while I was in the shower that you could probably hear the shower run, and that defeated the purpose of the whole shower-toothbrush combo."
"LUKE: Why are you up so early?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, you know me."
"LUKE: I do, so why are you up so early?"
"LORELAI: I have chores."
"LUKE: It's six o'clock in the morning."
"LORELAI: Well, it's early morning chores."
"LUKE: What's early morning chores?"
"LORELAI: You know, just milking cows, feeding chickens, slopping pigs."
"LUKE: You have to slop pigs?"
"LORELAI: They're certainly not gonna slop themselves."
"LUKE: You're being evasive."
"LORELAI: I'm not being evasive. I'm trying to remain mysterious so you still find me interesting 100 years from now."
"LUKE: Why won't you tell me where you're going?"
"LORELAI: Well...I'm going to the flower mart."
"LUKE: Why?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm meeting Sookie there because we were going to get ideas for flowers for the wedding..."
"LUKE: oh."
"LORELAI: ...That is now postponed."
"LUKE: Right."
"LORELAI: But I forgot to call her last night because I did, and, uh, she's there now, waiting for me to pick out flowers."
"LUKE: Sorry."
"LORELAI: No. Hey. It's my bad. I should have called her last night."
"LUKE: No, I meant I was sorry about the... [Sighs] You need a ride?"
"LORELAI: No… So, I should go. She's probably already there, and --"
"LUKE: Right. Go."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: I'll see you later."
"LORELAI: Yes. Yes, you will."
"LUKE: Uh, can I help?"
"LORELAI: Help what?"
"LUKE: Help you."
"LORELAI: Help me what?"
"LUKE: Cancel stuff."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: I mean you shouldn't have to do this all by yourself."
"LORELAI: No, it's fine. I'm a great canceller. I'm so smooth, people think I'm still gonna show up. I'm good."
"LUKE: But –"
"LORELAI: But I should really get going, I'll see you later?"
"LUKE: Tonight."
"LORELAI: Yeah...unless I cancel. [they both laugh] Just kidding. I'm not going to... oops [remembers to get something from the dresser] Go back to sleep."
"LUKE: [Luke gets out of bed and goes to Lorelai] Hold on…"
"LORELAI: Ow! [They bump into each other]"
"LUKE: God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to – [Luke laughs again]"
"LORELAI: It's fine. It's okay."
"LUKE: Uw –"
"LORELAI: It hurts so good, as Mr. Mellencamp said. Is it bleeding?"
"LUKE: No, no."
"LORELAI: Okay. [Luke sighs] That's okay. I'll see you."
"OPENING CREDITS"
"FLOWER MARKET"
"[Sookie is looking at the flowers]"
"SOOKIE: And what are those called?"
"FLOWER VENDOR: Bluebells."
"SOOKIE: Ooh Bluebells, that sounds fancy. And what are those?"
"FLOWER VENDOR: Fairy wings."
"SOOKIE: Fairy wings, so romantic. Do they smell good? Ohh. Terrible. Fairy wings smell like a very different part of the fairy, if you know what I mean."
"LORELAI: Sookie!"
"SOOKIE: Hi! Don't smell the fairy wings."
"LORELAI: Don't what?"
"SOOKIE: [Giggles] Never mind."
"LORELAI: Sorry I'm so late."
"SOOKIE: That is okay it gave me a chance to scope out the place. Sharon over there has great stuff, but she is completely anti-haggle. ""This is my price, and you will pay it."" You know what Sharon this is me walking away from you over to Miguel's, who's very haggle-friendly, but his roses suck. Do you want roses?"
"LORELAI: Sookie…[Trying to get her attention]"
"SOOKIE: Because if you don't, I saw some bluebells over at Tim's that I know are not your normal-bouquet kind of choice, but we can make something interesting out of them."
"LORELAI: Sookie..."
"SOOKIE: Yes?"
"LORELAI: The wedding has been postponed."
"SOOKIE: What did you do?"
"LORELAI: What did I do?"
"SOOKIE: Did you get cold feet? You can't get cold feet. We need to put some nice wool socks on those feet, because Luke is perfect for you."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: He waited for you to get over Christopher. He waited for you to get over Max."
"LORELAI: Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Why do you do this? Why do you want to make yourself miserable?"
"LORELAI: He has a kid."
"SOOKIE: Who has a kid?"
"LORELAI: Luke has a kid."
"SOOKIE: Luke has a kid?"
"LORELAI: Luke has a kid."
"SOOKIE: A kid, like a goat?"
"LORELAI: A kid, like a daughter. She's 12 years old. He found out a few months ago, and he just told me about it yesterday."
"SOOKIE: Holy Moly."
"LORELAI: He's completely in shock, and he's trying to handle it the best way he can."
"SOOKIE: Drinking?"
"LORELAI: No."
"SOOKIE: Xanax?"
"LORELAI: No. He's trying to be a father, and I applaud that."
"SOOKIE: So for 12 years Luke's had a daughter out there just walking around?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: That is crazy! Oh, my god."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I wonder if Jackson has a love child."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: I saw this kid wandering around town the other day. He looked exactly like Jackson and his voice was exactly like Jackson's, plus he was holding a banana, so I think he likes fruit."
"LORELAI: Jackson doesn't have a son he doesn't know about."
"SOOKIE: Why not? Luke had a daughter he didn't know anything about."
"LORELAI: I know."
"SOOKIE: You think Luke's the only one with a past? You think Jackson was a monk when I met him? He had seed, and he passed it around."
"LORELAI: Sookie..."
"SOOKIE: Sorry. Right. Sorry. So, how is Luke?"
"LORELAI: He's just trying to deal. I mean, he wants to do the right thing by April. That's her name… April."
"SOOKIE: Pretty name."
"LORELAI: Yeah, he's just trying to figure everything out and the wedding was coming up so fast, we decided to postpone it for a while."
"SOOKIE: That sucks."
"LORELAI: No, it's okay. It fine, it's just I have calls to make you know, all the plans were made."
"SOOKIE: I'm a great dialer. What do you need?"
"LORELAI: I have to call the printer and the caterer and the photographer and the and the… church the perfect church that only had one date available. I knew it was all too easy. I knew there had to be a catch."
"SOOKIE: No, there was not a catch. Luke will get over the shock of this, and he'll figure things out, and everything will be back to a big ""go, go, go"" again."
"LORELAI: Yeah know, Luke will figure it out. Everything will calm down."
"SOOKIE: That's right."
"LORELAI: I mean, it's all so fresh right now. No one's thinking straight."
"SOOKIE: No, they're not."
"LORELAI: I mean he could wake up tomorrow and feel completely differently or you know next week, maybe."
"SOOKIE: Maybe."
"LORELAI: You know maybe I shouldn't cancel everything right away. I mean I still have some time before I lose my deposit on the hall. Maybe I should just chill out and and see what happens. Is that crazy?"
"SOOKIE: No, it's not crazy at all."
"LORELAI: Okay. Then...I'll wait?"
"SOOKIE: Once more with feeling?"
"LORELAI: Okay, then, I'll wait."
"SOOKIE: Okay."
"LORELAI: It's early. Let's get some coffee. [They start walking] Are you talking about that Arnaz kid?"
"SOOKIE: Yes! That's the one!"
"LORELAI: Well, he does talk like Jackson."
"SOOKIE: I know, and he even gets louder at the end of his sentences!"
"LORELAI: That's weird."
"SOOKIE: I told you so."
"YALE COURTYARD"
"[Rory is working while walking and people are getting out of her way]"
"LOGAN: Stop. [Rory stops walking] Look. [Rory looks down]"
"RORY: I don't remember that being there yesterday."
"LOGAN: Yesterday you came from the other way, so you missed the trash can but you almost took out the bike rack."
"RORY: Thank god I have a guardian angel hanging out by the coffee kiosk."
"LOGAN: Well, it's the only place it's safe to stand with a maniac like you walking around. Plus, here, I'm guaranteed to run into you at least three times a day. [hands Rory a coffee] Your usual."
"RORY: You've been hanging out at this coffee cart every day."
"LOGAN: Yes, it's sad. I'm officially a wuss. If I saw me doing this, I'd b*at the crap out of myself."
"RORY: You have nothing better to do with your time?"
"LOGAN: Nothing better than to try and get you back, no."
"RORY: You're too slick for your own good, Huntzberger."
"LOGAN: Excuse me but this is not slick. This is a Nora Ephron movie. Louis Armstrong should be warbling as we talk. So come on please, put me out of my misery. You promised you'd let me take you to dinner."
"RORY: How 'bout Thursday night?"
"LOGAN: Really?"
"RORY: Yeah, I'll have turned in my article for the daily news and my Friday morning history class was canceled this week."
"LOGAN: Okay, great. Thursday it is 7:30. And do not think of backing out, because I will cry and eat a pint of rocky road while watching ""An Affair to Remember."" With Rita Wilson"
"RORY: Of course."
"LOGAN: 7:30?"
"RORY: Can't wait."
"LOGAN: Eyes on the road. [Rory stops reading and looks up]"
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai comes in the from door, dragging a bag of dog food]"
"LORELAI: [hi pitch voice] Paul Anka, mommy's home! She comes bearing kibble! [puts down the bag] Hey, where are you?! [Closes the front door] Oh, no. [Starts looking for him] What have you done? You're hiding. That means you've done something weird. [Sees a pile of book in front of the book shelves] Oh, seriously? You know some dogs dig! It might be a nice change of pace!"
"[Checks messages on answering machine, it beeps]"
"BABETTE: Hey, sugar. I heard some terrible crashing sounds coming from your living room today. I tried to get in, but Luke fixed the back door, so you can't jiggle it off the hinge anymore. [Lorelai starts to clean up the books] You should really talk to him about that, sweetie. Anyhow I hope everything's okay. Call me later if it's not. Bye-bye, toots! [Answering machine beeps]"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, it's your father. I'm calling to tell you there's been a little mistake with Rory's tuition at Yale. It Seems our check was returned to us. For whatever reason, they did not cash it. Now, don't worry. I'm sure it's just some sort of clerical mix-up. I've been on the phone with the bursar's office all morning. I'm currently waiting for a call from a Mrs. Linwood, and then I'm sure I will get this all cleared up. Tell Rory not to worry. [Lorelai picks up the phone and starts dialing a number] If anyone gives her any trouble, tell them to call me. I will call you later. Goodbye."
"THE PUB"
"[Rory is at a table working her cell phone rings, she looks for it.]"
"RORY: Hey, mom."
"LORELAI: Oh, you got your study voice."
"RORY: Yep, It goes with my pop-quiz walk and my term-paper face."
"LORELAI: Five minutes?"
"RORY: Go."
"LORELAI: I just got a call from your grandfather."
"RORY: [looking a little mad] Oh yeah."
"LORELAI: He called to tell me Yale returned his check. He thinks it's a clerical error."
"RORY: Huh…"
"LORELAI: Not a clerical error."
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: They're gonna find out, kid."
"RORY: Yep."
"LORELAI: Getting charged by the word on you calling plan?"
"RORY: What do you want me to say?"
"LORELAI: How about ""what do you think we should do?"""
"RORY: Nothing."
"LORELAI: Rory they're going to find out that Christopher is paying for Yale."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: And they're not gonna like it. It's gonna go over badly. It's gonna be the opening night of ""taboo"" all over again."
"RORY: They had to find out eventually, mom."
"LORELAI: Yes, but shouldn't they find out from you, not some office clerk at Yale?"
"RORY: What's the worst that can happen? We won't be speaking anymore? Gee, that would suck."
"LORELAI: Wow. Ice, ice, baby."
"RORY: Sorry, not trying to be cold, but I don't think I should feel guilty because I want my father to pay for college."
"LORELAI: No, you shouldn't, but my parents do have feelings. You saw my mom when the gardener butchered her box hedges."
"RORY: Okay, fine. I'll send them an e-mail."
"LORELAI: Okay, fine, but you could also call and tell them yourself. It'll probably only cost you 75, maybe 80 words."
"RORY: [Rory looks at the newspaper in front of her] Oh, no."
"LORELAI: What oh, no you saw a rat ""oh, no"" or you cut off your thumb ""oh, no""?"
"RORY: Paris."
"LORELAI: Oh, no."
"RORY: I have to call you back. [Rory starts packing up her stuff]"
"YALE DAILY NEW ROOM"
"[Paris is in a bad mood]"
"PARIS: The point is vague."
"A.K.: The point is not vague."
"PARIS: The point is vague! The conclusions are insane."
"[Rory come in the background]"
"A.K.: The conclusions are Johns Hopkins', not mine."
"PARIS: The research is sloppy, the sources are unreliable, the font is wrong, the paper feels thin, and the by-line should read ""story by a petulant 2-year-old ""who had one too many black and tans last night and so this is what you people get to read."" Fix it!"
"[Walks toward the water cooler]"
"PARIS: [To Rory] I can't get anyone to write their names on their cups and use them again. It doesn't seem that hard. Open sharpie, write name."
"RORY: Maybe people don't want to reuse a paper cup."
"PARIS: Well then, hopefully people who don't want to reuse a paper cup won't mind buying SPF 5000 for their grandkids when the rainforest is gone and the ozone layer is a doily and the human race is bursting into flames."
"RORY: Maybe we could just tell everyone to bring a mug for their water."
"PARIS: We could, but they won't bring a mug, just like they won't properly proof their articles or double-check their sources."
"RORY: Paris, did something happen? You seem upset."
"PARIS: I'm just dealing with the usual incompetence around here, that's all."
"RORY: [Shows Paris the newspaper] What happened here?"
"PARIS: Our pictures have sucked eggs lately, and so I sent out two photographers to cover the same story. They each came back with about 40 of the crappiest pictures ever to have been committed to film, completely unusable."
"RORY: It was supposed to be a picture of a football game."
"PARIS: I know."
"RORY: Well, was there one with a guy in a helmet holding a football? Because that's really all you need."
"PARIS: They were predictable and standard."
"RORY: Guy in helmet holding ball."
"PARIS: Cover of the Harvard crimson, after the big game, guy with helmet holding ball. Stanford game, guy in helmet holding ball. I wanted something more okay, something that really said something about the game."
"RORY: Like ""we forgot to go""?"
"PARIS: And then, of course, when the temperamental artistes found out I had double-booked the gig, they threw Naomi Campbell-level hissy fits and quit."
"RORY: So you just left it blank? Why, to make them look bad? Because it doesn't make them look bad. It makes you look bad."
"PARIS: It was up to the sports editor to inform me that no picture was approved."
"RORY: You needed someone to remind you, you didn't approve a picture?"
"PARIS: Hey, I have a million different things I am doing here!"
"RORY: Paris, we cannot be publishing papers that have blank spots in them, and we cannot have all our photographers quit because there's not an endless supply of them."
"PARIS: Oh please, how hard is it to look through a hole and push a button? I can do it myself. How are you doing on your story?"
"RORY: Fine. You'll have it first thing tomorrow morning."
"PARIS: Finally, one person I can count on. [Putting papers one someone's desk] These need more work."
"BILL: These are locked."
"PARIS: Well, unlock them."
"You've got entire paragraphs cut out. This is hours of work. The paper comes out tomorrow. I'd have to track down every writer, get them in her to re-write…"
"PARIS: Then track them down, because those stories are not going in the paper like that. [Walks away and into a ""bunker"" she has made out of cubical partitions and sheets of iron on top]"
"BILL: She's out of control. She's a mad dictator. She's the kind of dictator they don't just like to k*ll. She's the kind I'd like to drag through the streets and then hang from a lamppost for a month and a half."
"RORY: Let's just get this paper out. Where's Sheila?"
"BILL: Sick."
"RORY: What about Joni?"
"BILL: Sick."
"RORY: There's an awful lot of sickness going on around here lately."
"BILL: Yes, there certainly is and there's probably going to be a lot more very soon. [On the phone] Michelle? Bill. Well, I just talked to Paris and you know what that means. Easy, just the messenger."
"[Paris speeds out of the ""bunker"" to a desk and tears up the papers she was holding, then goes back to the ""bunker""]"
"LORELAI AND LUKE‘S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is at the Kitchen table with a plate of dessert in front of her, she is dialing a number on the phone. The phone rings in Richards office]"
"RICHARD: Hello?"
"LORELAI: Hi, dad. It's Lorelai."
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Mom?"
"RICHARD: Emily?"
"EMILY: Richard?"
"LORELAI: Rowan? Martin?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai called me, Emily."
"EMILY: She did, what for?"
"RICHARD: I don't know, she hasn't told me yet."
"EMILY: Lorelai, why did you call your father?"
"LORELAI: Well I just wanted to know how he was doing."
"RICHARD: I'm doing fine."
"LORELAI: Very glad to hear that."
"RICHARD: All right. It's good of you to check in."
"EMILY: Goodbye, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Whoa, guys, wait."
"RICHARD: Is there more?"
"LORELAI: More than the nothing there just was? Yes, there's more."
"EMILY: Hurry up, please. I'm meeting Bill Chandler at the club, and I'm late."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, I just wanted to tell you that there was no mistake with your Yale check."
"RICHARD: There wasn't?"
"LORELAI: No um, they sent you back your check because Yale has already been paid for."
"EMILY: By whom?"
"LORELAI: By Christopher."
"EMILY: Christopher who?"
"LORELAI: Christopher Isherwood. That ""cabaret"" money was burning a hole in his pocket. You know what Christopher, mom…His grandfather passed away recently and left him some money and he just wanted to do something for Rory. He's trying to be a dad for once. I thought it seemed like a good idea. [Emily slams down the phone]"
"LORELAI: Hello? Guys, are you there?"
"RICHARD: I'm here, Lorelai. Your mother had to go."
"LORELAI: Oh, dad, please don't read too much into this. I mean, when was the last time Christopher wanted to do anything for Rory? He wants to contribute. This is a good thing… This is not a snub, dad, I swear. Rory and I are so grateful for everything you and mom have done, all the help you've given her. She would not be in Yale right now if it weren't for you and she would never have gone to Chilton. She would have graduated Stars Hollow high and then gone to community college and then beauty school."
"RICHARD: I have to go, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Dad!"
"RICHARD: I appreciate the phone call. I simply wish it had come before I called every person in the bursar's office a moron."
"LORELAI: Well...if it will make you feel any better, odds are, at least two of them truly deserved it. [Richard chuckles]"
"YALE CAFETERIA"
"[Lorelai and Rory and walking]"
"LORELAI: I can't believe you didn't dress crazy like we agreed."
"RORY: We never agreed to dress crazy."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? We did so, on the phone last night when we made our lunch plans."
"RORY: You saying, ""hey, let's dress crazy,"" does not equate to us agreeing to dress crazy."
"LORELAI: For years, it did."
"RORY: Well, for years, you bought my clothes for me, so I had very little choice."
"LORELAI: Oh, so typical, kid grows up, goes to a fancy school, becomes a snob, and is suddenly ashamed of her mother. You totally Mildred Pierced me."
"RORY: I did not Mildred Pierce you."
"LORELAI: Oh, you'll miss me when I'm gone."
"RORY: Oh, my god."
"LORELAI: Just an observation. The food here has gotten worse. Ooh, coffee!"
"RORY: You have coffee in your hand."
"LORELAI: By the time she makes a new one, the old one will be gone."
"RORY: Okay, two, please."
"LORELAI: Two double cappuccinos, please. [Rory hands over some money]"
"RORY: Thanks for having lunch with me."
"LORELAI: Well, you paid."
"RORY: So, guess what."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I'm having dinner with Logan tonight."
"LORELAI: So, he finally wormed his way back in, huh?"
"RORY: He did, at that."
"LORELAI: Is he taking you someplace fabulous?"
"RORY: Odds are."
"LORELAI: Want to borrow my scarf?"
"RORY: Wait for the wedding night?"
"LORELAI: [giggles] You got it. [Takes coffee from vendor] Ooh, thank you, ma'am. Well, I talked to your grandparents last night."
"RORY: Oh, so now they're my grandparents."
"LORELAI: I told them about Yale."
"RORY: Good."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: I'm glad."
"LORELAI: You're glad I told them or you're glad they know?"
"RORY: Both."
"LORELAI: You want to know how they took it?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: They took it great. Mom practically broke the phone, she hung up so hard, and dad, well, dad was solemn, quiet, sad. It was a huge success. Okay here's how I see it, you and your grandparents are at a huge crossroads. A press-avis if you will. They are the bridges of Madison county, and you are Meryl Streep."
"RORY: As the paper pages go flying off the calendar."
"LORELAI: Hey, listen to me. I'm serious here. I know you and your grandparents are playing the ""who can freeze out who the longest?"" Which I know can be fun, but if you ever hope to have a relationship with them again, then someone needs to make the first move. I remember the first Christmas after we left Hartford. We were at The Independence Inn, and I got an invitation to their annual Christmas party, and I didn't go, and that one move defined our entire future relationship. I mean, if I had gone, it would have been awful, but it would have broken the ice, and maybe and I know this is a big ""maybe"" but maybe we would have been a tad closer than we are now or could ever hope to be."
"RORY: Maybe, maybe not."
"LORELAI: I just know how much you love your grandparents and how important to you it was to have a relationship with them, and I don't want the fact that you inherited my stubbornness to screw all that up."
"RORY: Okay, I hear you."
"LORELAI: Do you? Because my scarf is screaming as loud as it can."
"RORY: I will think about it."
"LORELAI: Alright…You have till 6:45 Friday night, then we're having dinner with them."
"RORY: What?!"
"LORELAI: I made the plans last night."
"RORY: But --"
"LORELAI: Come on, Rory. Friday night dinners, cocktails, Mozart, mind games, good times."
"RORY: Yeah, but I'm not so sure about this."
"LORELAI: Rory mom already said she's really into this, you can't back out now."
"RORY: She is?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Grandma said she was ""into this""?"
"LORELAI: Well, you know, she didn't say it like that, but she said, [English accent] ""oh! Dinner with Rory! ""How delightful! Well, spit-spot. Alert the corgis."""
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Yes, yes, she's into it. Now, what do you say?"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay? Do you want to wear my scarf to dinner? I know you do."
"YALE PAPER NEWS ROOM"
"[It is abnormally quite, not many people]"
"RORY: Bill."
"BILL: Well, look who's all dressed up for the ball."
"RORY: I sent in my story this morning and never got a confirmation call, did you get it?"
"BILL: Yep."
"RORY: Well, no one called me in for a final edit and I need to finish this up now. I have a date tonight. So, who is the copy editor on my piece?"
"BILL: That would be Michael."
"RORY: Well, where is Michael and everyone else?"
"BILL: Well, let's see. The sports department, city department, entertainment department, and feature department, other than you, have quit. Michael quit. Sylvia quit. Joni quit. Sheila's sick tonight, but as soon as she's better, she's going to quit."
"RORY: Great."
"BILL: Oh, not done. The senior editor quit. The entire copy department quit. The little fellow who brought around sandwiches in the basket quit."
"RORY: Okay, fine, I get it. Everyone quit."
"BILL: Not everyone, but close. It was quite an exodus, very biblical. All that was missing were the Cabala bracelets and the Matzo."
"RORY: Whatever. We'll figure that out later. Right now I just need to finish my article, so I guess you and I can do it together."
"BILL: We could, but I quit, too."
"RORY: What?"
"BILL: Right after Joni. I bowed out. I actually bowed, physically bowed."
"RORY: Then what are you doing here?"
"BILL: Are you kidding, I'm going to have a ringside seat for the event of the century. Tonight will be the first time ever in the history of the Yale daily news that the paper does not come out."
"RORY: Very nice."
"BILL: D-day, the paper came out. Kennedy gets sh*t, the paper comes out. But three months of the Geller reign of terror, and the whole damn institution comes tumbling down."
"RORY: You suck, Bill."
"[Rory goes to the ""bunker""]"
"RORY: Paris? [She goes inside] Holy crap."
"PARIS: [she is busy working] I can't talk now."
"RORY: What happened to this place? There's no air in here or light. Where are your fire exits? You love fire exits."
"PARIS: No one can write a lead, no one."
"RORY: [sighs] Paris, do you have any idea what's going on out there?"
"PARIS: I can't think about that now."
"RORY: Half the staff has quit, no more than half the staff has quit and there's no one out there working."
"PARIS: There's no one out there working when there's people out there working. Ship of fools."
"RORY: Paris, the paper's not gonna come out."
"PARIS: Of course it is."
"RORY: How? Nothing's done."
"PARIS: I'm working on it."
"RORY: Alone?"
"PARIS: I can do it alone. I've been doing it alone for months. No man is an island, but this woman is."
"RORY: But, Paris."
"PARIS: I've got it all scheduled out. As long as I stick to the schedule, everything's going to be fine. I'm finishing up a review of the drama club's production of ""Sweeney Todd"" now. Then 9:30 to 10:00, I'm gonna finalize the layout. 10:00 to 11:00 copy editing. 11:00 to 12:30…"
"RORY: Let me see that…Paris, there's like 100 hours of work on this and 5 hours till the paper comes out."
"PARIS: I'll get it done."
"RORY: You better get bitten by that radioactive spider pretty damn fast here."
"PARIS: I'll get it done, I just have to focus and just have to stop allowing myself to be distracted."
"RORY: Paris!"
"PARIS: [Yells] Don't distract me! [Puts on ear muffs, Rory leaves the ""bunker""]"
"RORY: Okay, everyone, listen up. We have work to do. You, t-shirt, you're doing layout. And, you, saggy pants, get all the heelers' numbers, call them and tell them to get in here, they've just been promoted. And Tally I need Sheila and Joni's numbers A.S.A.P. Come on, people! Move! We've got a paper to get out! [Everyone starts to get busy]"
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Sookie and Lorelai enter the front door]"
"SOOKIE: I just think that if Michel had somebody to come home to, he might go home."
"LORELAI: Oh, he's been driving me crazy about turning the stable into a spa."
"SOOKIE: What would we do with the horses?"
"LORELAI: Well, we'd work them in. We'd have the first hot-hoof massage on the east coast."
"SOOKIE: 'Cause they've already got them in California."
"LORELAI: Yeah [giggling] Hi, Paul Anka. You haven't done anything weird yet today, I see. Do you remember Sookie?"
"SOOKIE: Hi, Paul Anka. You're gonna come spend the night with me. Are you sure this is okay?"
"LORELAI: Yeah It's fine."
"SOOKIE: We think a dog would be good for Davey, he love him. I just want to make sure that Jackson and I are dog people first."
"LORELAI: Aw, you are."
"SOOKIE: Hmm, I mean, I know babies, but dogs..."
"LORELAI: Are just furry babies. Here keep him occupied for a second."
"SOOKIE: Ooo, Hi, Paul Anka. You want to come have a sleepover at my house, huh? [to Lorelai] What are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Uh, he freaks out if he sees his leash. You have to make sure you hide it from him, make sure he doesn't see you putting it on him."
"SOOKIE: How is he once he's on the leash?"
"LORELAI: Oh he's totally fine having his freedom slowly stripped away as long as he's completely unaware that it's happening, just like a true American. It's all yours. [Hands Sookie the leash]"
"SOOKIE: Thanks Come on, Paul Anka. Come on we're gonna have fun tonight. Yes we are. [they both giggle]"
"[Lorelai checks the answering machine for messages]"
"LUKE: I hope you had a good day with Rory. I would have called you earlier, but I didn't want to interrupt the fun, so I thought I'd try you at home, but you're not at home. Anyhow, April is coming to the diner tonight from 5:00 to 8:00, so I'll see you here after 8:00. Okay, bye."
"LORELAI: [snorts] Hum…"
"SOOKIE: After 8:00?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, that's what he said."
"SOOKIE: I guess you two decided that you're not gonna see the kid."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I guess we did. [sounding a little annoyed]"
"SOOKIE: Hey, if we get a dog, we're gonna name it Chef. Get it? 'Cause I'm a cook."
"LORELAI: Oh, cool."
"SOOKIE: You want me to leave Paul Anka?"
"LORELAI: No, take him. I'm great."
"SOOKIE: You are?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I think that's what we decided. [rolls her eyes]"
"SOOKIE: [to Paul Anka] Come on. Come on."
"LORELAI: Bye, hon."
"OUTSIDE THE SODA SHOPPE"
"[A line of people are waiting, Lorelai walks past and into the shop]"
"KIRK: One sample per person, people, one sample only. Don't make me use the candy thermometer on you."
"[Lorelai enters and sees April through the window sitting at the counter in the dinner]"
"RUTHIE: [To Lorelai] Hey. There's a line."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. I was just…"
"RUTHIE: I know what you were doing."
"LORELAI: I wasn't to do anything…"
"MAN: You're trying to shove in for the free chocolate."
"LORELAI: I wasn't trying, [surprised] free chocolate, really?"
"KIRK: European hot chocolate. It's like mud but chocolaty."
"RUTHIE: And you were trying to shove in the line…"
"BABETTE: Oh, can it, Ruthie. When your foot's not in your mouth, you don't know what to do with yourself. Come on sugar. [guides Lorelai to the counter]"
"LORELAI: Oh but there's a…"
"BABETTE: Two, Kirk."
"KIRK: You'll have to wait in line…"
"BABETTE: [takes two from Kirk] Here, doll. Cheers."
"LORELAI: Cheers."
"BABETTE: Oh, patty, did I tell you about Tilly's new face-lift? Scotch tape. [Patty laughs]"
"[Lorelai goes over to a table near the window and sits down, to look at April and Luke, In the background Kirk can be heard]"
"KIRK: Next…here you go…one for you…piping hot chocolate get it's hot."
"BABETTE: What are we looking at?"
"LORELAI: Oh I don't…"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, I know what we're looking at. We're looking at Luke and his daughter."
"LORELAI: How did you know that?"
"BABETTE: That was page-one news around here for a week. So, what's the scoop?"
"LORELAI: Oh well, I don't know."
"MISS PATTY: All we know is that she's 12 years old and that she's seeking him out."
"BABETTE: I heard her mother was that Nardini girl. Remember her,"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, yeah. She was beautiful."
"BABETTE: What's she look like now?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"MISS PATTY: You don't?"
"LORELAI: Well I haven't really meet…"
"BABETTE: Luke was pretty serious about her. He tell you about them?"
"LORELAI: No, but I don't tell him about my boyfriends either."
"MISS PATTY: Well, no, because he's met all of them already."
"LORELAI: He hasn't met all of them, some."
"BABETTE: Most."
"MISS PATTY: Well, what's the kid like?"
"BABETTE: Yeah. You get along?"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, we will."
"MISS PATTY: You mean you don't know?"
"BABETTE: [too Miss Patty] That's to be expected."
"MISS PATTY: She looks like a reader. Is she a reader?"
"BABETTE: Can you imagine Luke with a reader?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, I can't imagine Luke with a daughter."
"BABETTE: Can you imagine Luke with a kid?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, my god, I can't believe that. Luke has a kid. Can you believe Luke has a kid?"
"LORELAI: He's not a 100-year-old eunuch or anything."
"RUTHIE: There's other people here who would like a table."
"BABETTE: We're busy. Go lick the empties."
"RUTHIE: Busy doing what?"
"LORELAI: Nothing, nothing."
"MISS PATTY: We're looking at Luke's kid."
"LORELAI: Patty!"
"MISS PATTY: Well, honey, everyone knows."
"RUTHIE: That's her?"
"LADY: Luke's kid?"
"MISS PATTY: Up at the counter."
"BABETTE: Lorelai was just about to give us the inside scoop."
"[A crowd starts to form around the table]"
"LORELAI: I was not about to give you the…"
"MISS PATTY: So, do they want money?"
"LORELAI: I don't think so…"
"MISS PATTY: Do you think that Luke's gonna get a lawyer, does he want custody?"
"LORELAI: I don't know he could…"
"RUTHIE: Are you sure that's his kid? She's reading."
"KIRK: You're clogging up the flow here."
"MISS PATTY: We're looking at Luke's kid."
"KIRK: So that's Luke's kid. Well, well, well, what is she reading, a book?"
"[Babette laughs, Crowd murmuring, Lorelai gets up]"
"LORELAI: Would you excuse me, I just have to, pardon me. Yeah."
"[Luke sees the crowd at the table and is annoyed, he didn't see Lorelai leave]"

"YALE NEWSROOM"
"[It's busy and Rory is leading still giving orders]"
"RORY: Okay. No, yes, done, go. And triple-check the changes. Make sure it makes sense. [To Joni] How are we doing?"
"JONI: I have a very strong opinion that I have no opinion on the opinion piece."
"RORY: And the subject is?"
"JONI: Hand blowers in the bathrooms."
"RORY: And the Pulitzer prize goes to? Just make sure it's done in 20 minutes."
"SHEILA: Printer's on the phone. We're losing our spot."
"RORY: Hello? Who am I speaking to? Hello, Russell. This is Rory Gilmore. What's this I hear about us losing our spot? …Yes…Well, we had an epidemic hit our staff this week, and, unfortunately, it has put us a bit behind. However, we are quickly getting back on track, and maybe, considering the circumstances, you could cut us a little slack, give us a bit of an extension… I know, but we've never asked for it before, and we will never ask for it again…By the way, you sound like a very handsome man, Russell… Yes, I'm using my wiles and everything else I can to get you to… one hour. I'll take it. Thank you, Russell. You have a slightly inappropriate Christmas card coming your way this year. [To the news room] We have a one-hour extension! [Sighs] That one and use them both if we need to fill space."
"BILL: Hey, I was cat's-cradling!"
"RORY: Bill, get your ass out of that chair and work or get your ass out of that chair and leave. Either way, get your ass out of that chair."
"BILL: I am not interested in helping Paris do anything."
"RORY: You wouldn't be helping Paris. You would be helping me."
"BILL: Fine, but if Punxsutawney Phil sticks her head out of her hole, I am out of here."
"RORY: Interested in some desking?"
"BILL: I'm on it."
"MAN: Computer crashed again."
"RORY: Unplug it and plug it back in. If that doesn't work, call I.T. And get someone over here now. [To Logan] Oh, my god. Our date. I'm so sorry. Paris melted down and everyone quit and the paper wasn't gonna come out, and I only found out about it because no one called me to confirm they got my story, so I called in all the heelers, and I got Sheila and Joni to come in, and I called Pete, who said he was sick, but I threatened his job, so he came in, but he was really sick, so I just sent him home so he did get everyone else sick. Plus, the printers are trying to give our time away, the computers keep crashing, and then there's the tiny little detail of nothing's done. And d-day, the paper came out, and I forgot. I'm sorry."
"LOGAN: I can't believe you didn't call me."
"RORY: I know, but it's just paper stuff."
"LOGAN: I know. I'm on the paper."
"RORY: You hate it here."
"LOGAN: I know this crap backwards and forwards. I can't believe you didn't even think to call me."
"RORY: Well, I'm sorry. I just didn't think you were interested."
"LOGAN: Well then I guess you don't know everything, now, do you? So come on what have you got here?"
"RORY: Well, this is an article on Greenspan. He gave an interview with all this technical economic jargon."
"LOGAN: I know the jargon. [Looking at other papers] Are these proofed?"
"RORY: Yeah, but they're not typed in yet."
"LOGAN: I'll do that I'll be faster I type 90 words a minute."
"RORY: You do?"
"LOGAN: You really did only like me for my looks, huh? How you doing on content?"
"RORY: Uh, still a little short."
"LOGAN: Okay, I got a couple stories banked that I didn't give Paris. There in pretty decent shape you can take a look at them."
"RORY: Okay."
"LOGAN: And just remember, if you still need material, cannibalize everything you have ready for Friday's issue."
"RORY: Robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"LOGAN: Peter's asking for it. Okay so, who do you have desking?"
"RORY: Bill."
"LOGAN: I'd throw Sheila on there with him. It will hurt his ego and make him work faster. Okay I'll be over here if you need me and [Too Bill] get that yo-yo off the floor. Somebody's gonna break their neck. [Logan walks away and Rory looks pleased]"
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Their bedroom, they are getting ready for bed]"
"LUKE: I mean, can you believe she reads? I have a kid who reads. Crazy! She sat there for hours doing her homework, geometry. That's some crazy stuff. I actually bought a book, ""geometry for dummies."" I stash it in the kitchen and run back there every time she asks me a question, thinking I can keep up with her but I can't figure out what the hell it says. I mean, it's just this mess of weird symbols and shapes and, I wonder if there's another book I could get."
"LORELAI: Um, ""'geometry for dummies' for dummies""?"
"LUKE: Yes, exactly."
"LORELAI: Luke, she has teachers. And all you have to do is nod and smile. That's what I did with Rory."
"LUKE: I just want her to, you know, [sighs] not be embarrassed I'm her dad."
"LORELAI: Impossible."
"LUKE: Well, step by step you know, first step, making sure she's comfortable around me."
"LORELAI: She sure seems to be, I mean, you know, 'cause she's coming here and hanging out at the diner. She wouldn't do that if she was uncomfortable."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, she's gonna be with this village of idiots I live in. Do you know tonight, she comes to the diner, right? She's sitting at the counter, doing her homework there. I look over at the Soda Shoppe, and the whole damn town is staring through the window at us."
"LORELAI: No!"
"LUKE: Oh yeah like we're monkeys in a zoo. I could have k*ll them all."
"LORELAI: That's terrible what happened?"
"LUKE: Nothing she didn't notice anything. She was too busy studying. I just couldn't believe those people. I mean can't they get that this is a private thing, I'm trying to get to know my kid? I mean you understand, you're not all over me about this. You get that we need some alone time."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I do. I totally do."
"LUKE: Thank you. [they kiss]"
"LORELAI: Sure. Any time."
"YALE NEWSROOM"

"LOGAN: Twice. How are we doing on time?"
"BILL: Uh, bad."
"LOGAN: More specifically?"
"JONI: 10 minutes."
"RORY: We'll make it."
"LOGAN: We will make it. Spelling on name, it's Cheevers' name?"
"JONI: c-h-e-e-v-e-r-s."
"LOGAN: You're sure about the double e's?"
"JONI: Not at all."
"LOGAN: Two e's it is. Okay. And I'm done."
"RORY: Close out. I'll cut and paste it to the final copy."
"LOGAN: Closing out. Wow! So, that's what hard work feels like. Apparently I've been avoiding it for a reason. You in Ace."
"RORY: I'm in. Proceeding with the cut and paste now."
"BILL: [Telephone rings, Bill rushed for it] The daily news."
"LOGAN: Aw, man."
"RORY: Why are you smiling?"
"LOGAN: I'm thinking about the hundreds of different ways you owe me for this."
"RORY: I owe you nothing. You did this for the greater good. For the glory of the paper."
"LOGAN: For a foot massage."
"A.K.: Are we close?"
"RORY: Very, very close."
"BILL: Well, kids, hold on to your hats. We are losing our printing time."
"RORY: No! Remind Russell about the Christmas card."
"BILL: I don't think he cares. He's giving it to the Cart."
"RORY: No, he can't!"
"BILL: He did."
"RORY: Ohh! So, that's it? We just lose? After all this work, we just lose?"
"LOGAN: Keep typing, ace."
"RORY: Why? What's the point?"
"LOGAN: Type!"
"BILL: Well, I guess you'll be talking on the phone now."
"LOGAN: Go away, Bill. Hey… Hay, who am I speaking with? Russell, I'm Logan Huntzberger… Yes, those Huntzbergers…It's great to speak with you, too. I hear there's a problem with our printing time? Uh-huh. No, I completely understand. The first thing I learned from my father is that there's no paper unless it gets to the printer on time. Yes he is quite a legend, my father. I'd love to introduce you to him sometime. Anyway, Russell, the thing is we actually sent the issue to you already… Oh…Yes, at least 15 minutes ago. Now, if you're having a problem with your server, we shouldn't be penalized for that, right? Yeah, it should be in the system right now. Sure. Go check… But before you do, if you could spell your name for me, I want to have the correct pronunciation when I speak with my father. Uh-huh, Russell. Damn! My pen broke. Hold on. [people start looking for a pen, but Logan doesn't really want one] I'm looking for a pen. I'm looking for a pen. Looking for a pen."
"RORY: Almost there."
"LOGAN: Okay. I found a pen. Here we go. What's your name? ""Russell Smith."" Okay I didn't really need a pen for that one, now, did I? Okay, Russell Smith, if you go to your computer, [speaking slowly] I am definitely, absolutely sure that you will turn it on and you will see that we, The Yale Daily News, have successfully completed our mission and sent to you our e-mail containing the latest issue of the [back to normal speed] it's all there, man. [Sighs]"
"RORY: What, what's happening?"
"LOGAN: You got it? All right, great. It's been great speaking with you, too. I'll tell my father, bye. [hangs up the phone] And that's how we do it at the day news. [Cheers]"
"PARIS: [coming out of hiding] All right! We got the paper out! That's what I'm talking about, people! Good hustle! Really good hustle! And they said we couldn't do it, huh? Boy, what a rush, right?!"
"RORY: So, I'm just saying that when that giant asteroid heads toward earth, I want you in that fighter jet."
"LOGAN: Thanks for the vote of confidence."
"RORY: You saved my ass."
"LOGAN: Infinitely worth saving."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LOGAN: You're welcome. [They kiss]"
"RORY: I'm sorry we didn't get our dinner."
"LOGAN: We didn't…Huh. [pulls a paper bag from his desk] I thought that we did. [sets up some drinks and candle, helps Rory sit and hands her some food.]"
"RORY: Boy, when you're on..."
"GILMORE MANSION – OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR"
"[Lorelai and Rory are looking at the front door]"
"LORELAI: [Telling a story] Once upon a time, there was a big house with thick glass windows and heavy stone walls and a slightly pornographic fountain in the driveway. And all the animals in the forest were scared of the house 'cause they thought that the house was haunted, and so did all the villagers in the small hamlet of Hartfordshireville. ""Maids go in, but they never come out,"" they would whisper on the street. [To Rory] How are we doing?"
"RORY: Keep going."
"LORELAI: One day, a beautiful, young Cowherderess walked by the house."
"RORY: Cowherderess?"
"LORELAI: Hey, we could just go in, you know?"
"RORY: Cowherderess is walking by."
"LORELAI: And suddenly she felt the unbearable need for a strand of pearls and a snifter of 100-year-old scotch. So, abandoning her cows, she climbed over the high walls and dropped onto the just-redone tiled walkway and rushed toward the enchanted French doors that the queen had never been happy with because the hardware was not what she had picked, and she refused to pay that idiot designer that she hired off of a recommendation, and [To Rory again] okay, seriously, this didn't work when you were 4. I am not sure why you thought it would do any good now. [Sighs] It's gonna be fine."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: Come on, my little Cowherderess. Do you want to press the bell,"
"or should I? [Rory presses the door bell.]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"MAID: Hello. Come in."
"LORELAI: Oh, thank you. See? We've been invited in. Such a great start, don't you think?"
"RORY: [quietly] Huh."
"MAID: May I take your coats?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yes, thank you."
"MAID: Mr. Gilmore is in the living room."
"[They move into the living room, Richard is reading a book.]"
"LORELAI: Hi. [Chuckles] Hey, dad."
"RORY: Hi, grandpa."
"RICHARD: Hello, Lorelai. Rory, how nice to see you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you too."
"RICHARD: Would you like a drink?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, that would be great. [Richard goes back to reading]"
"LORELAI: [A pause] …I can get it."
"RICHARD: Just wanted to finish the sentence. Excellent book, shame to put it down. I hope martinis will be fine."
"LORELAI: Ooh, better than fine."
"RICHARD: Will Rory be having a martini?"
"LORELAI: Yes, she will."
"RORY: A really small one."
"LORELAI: Oh, something smells really good, doesn't it, Rory?"
"RORY: It does. It smells really good."
"EMILY: [Enters from ratio] Oh. You're here."
"LORELAI: Oh, mom. Where'd you come from?"
"RORY: Hi, grandma."
"EMILY: Hello, Rory. Are you getting them a drink, Richard?"
"RICHARD: Yes, I am, Emily."
"LORELAI: Something smells really good, mom."
"EMILY: Oh, good. Well, enjoy your drinks. They're doing a showing for my art class at the D.A.R., And I'm doing a moonscape. I'm just finishing it up out on the patio."
"LORELAI: You're painting?"
"EMILY: I am."
"LORELAI: Right now?"
"EMILY: Well, you never know when inspiration's going to hit. You know, I'm actually getting pretty good. I think I have a sh*t at a medal. Excuse me."
"RICHARD: Two martinis."
"LORELAI: Oh, thank you, dad."
"RORY: Boy, that's a serious martini."
"RICHARD: Drink what you like. Leave the rest… So, what's new?"
"LORELAI: Oh, um, well, not too much. Um, things at the inn are going well. Business, you know. Um, we're booked up through…"
"RICHARD: My martini's not cold enough. How's yours?"
"LORELAI: Mine's fine."
"RICHARD: I'm gonna get new ice. I'll make another batch. [Leaves the room]"
"RORY: Grandma's outside painting moonscapes."
"LORELAI: Well, she thinks she can get a medal."
"RORY: I thought you said she wanted me to come."
"LORELAI: She did."
"RORY: Mom, she is sitting outside in the 40-degree weather painting moonscapes so she doesn't have to be inside with me."
"LORELAI: That is not the reason."
"RORY: Did she or did she not say she wanted us to come over for dinner?"
"LORELAI: She did not say it, but I know deep down she does."
"RORY: But you lied to me."
"RICHARD: [returning] New ice. I can re-shake yours if you like."
"LORELAI: Hey, dad, is something wrong?"
"RICHARD: Wrong?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, you're very picky about your ice, and mom's painting."
"RICHARD: There's nothing wrong, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Is mom still mad?"
"RICHARD: Mad at whom?"
"RORY: Mad at me?"
"RICHARD: Anger is a useless emotion Rory, It's a waste of time. Your mother has a sh*t at a medal. That's all that's going on around here."
"LORELAI: Okay, right. [Goes to the patio door] Mom, could you come in here just for a sec? I'd like to ask you something."
"EMILY: Well...all right."
"LORELAI: Can you sit down for a minute?"
"EMILY: Let me go change first."
"LORELAI: Sit down first."
"EMILY: I can't sit down in my painting clothes."
"LORELAI: Why are they painted on?"
"EMILY: I'll go upstairs and shower and change."
"LORELAI: [Angry] Mom!"
"RICHARD: This ice has a funny taste to it, I'm gonna get some more."
"LORELAI: Now, come on, you two. Can we please just talk about this?"
"EMILY: Talk about what."
"LORELAI: You're obviously upset about Christopher paying for Yale and I get it. We should have told you earlier, but let me just explain how it happened."
"RORY: No. It's my responsibility. Let me explain."
"EMILY: I don't think anyone needs to explain anything except why I'm not being allowed to clean myself."
"RORY: He came to me, and he asked if he could do anything and…"
"RICHARD: this really isn't necessary."
"RORY: I let him pay for Yale. He's my father."
"EMILY: [Laughs]"
"LORELAI: You know something I don't, mom?"
"EMILY: How convenient that he's her father now."
"RICHARD: Perhaps your father can reimburse me for the five cases of scotch I had to send the men in the bursar's office."
"RORY: I sure he would be happy to."
"EMILY: You know what else I find amusing?"
"LORELAI: ""Reno 911!""?"
"EMILY: I find it very amusing that Christopher is suddenly such a wonderful person."
"LORELAI: Mom!"
"EMILY: It seams to me when I was in cahoots with him, everyone thought that I was a villain, and now suddenly you're in cahoots with him, and that's perfectly fine."
"LORELAI: Please don't say ""cahoots"" anymore. It's disturbing."
"EMILY: You're being hypocritical, don't you think?"
"LORELAI: No I don't, you were trying to break Luke and me up, and I'm trying to put Rory through college."
"RICHARD: Rory was already being put through college by us."
"EMILY: That's right."
"RORY: I didn't want you to pay for it anymore."
"EMILY: There, there it is."
"RICHARD: So you went to Christopher."
"RORY: He came to me."
"EMILY: Oh, please. You just wanted to hurt us."
"RORY: By taking money from my father?"
"RICHARD: Yes, exactly!"
"EMILY: I've had enough of this. I'm going back out to touch up my moonscape."
"RICHARD: I have some work to do."
"RORY: Fine I have to go anyhow."
"[They all start waling away]"
"LORELAI: Hey!… This is not gonna happen. You're not going back out to your moonscape, you're not going back to work, and you're not going home. Now, we all agreed to have Friday night dinner, and we're here, and I smell dinner, and, yes, apparently there are some issues to be worked out, but no one, and I mean no one, is leaving here until we do!"
"[Cut to the dining room and diner has started]"
"RORY: Things were out of control."
"EMILY: Not the point, simply not the…"
"RORY: It is completely the…"
"RICHARD: Rory, do not cut your grandmother off."
"RORY: I'm just saying…"
"EMILY: You come running to us, begging us to take you in because you can't possibly deal with your mother."
"RORY: That's not what happened."
"EMILY: We take you in we pay to redecorate the pool house so you can have a place all your own."
"RORY: I did not ask you to do that."
"EMILY: You accepted it you did not turn it down. I didn't hear you saying, ""grandma, stop."" I didn't see you throw yourself at the decorators while they were putting up your very expensive wallpaper! And then when you don't like how things are going, you leave!"
"RICHARD: With no notice, by the way, and you leave two strange boys in our house unsupervised."
"EMILY: We're missing two picture frames, by the way."
"RORY: Colin and Finn did not steal your pictures!"
"RICHARD: [yelling] Do not raise your voice to your grandmother!"
"EMILY: I never realized how spoiled you were, Rory, but I guess that's to be expected. Only children are always spoiled."
"RORY: I'm sorry I didn't leave a note."
"EMILY: My, that sounds heartfelt. Doesn't that sound heartfelt, Richard?"
"RICHARD: Well I've never been more touched in all my life."
"RORY: I apologize. You don't believe it. I try to defend myself, and you don't want to hear it. So, apparently, there's nothing I can do here."
"EMILY: Oh, there's plenty you can do."
"RORY: What? What can I do?"
"EMILY: Well first of all you can admit what you've done. You can apologize!"
"RORY: I was just trying to apologize!"
"LORELAI: Cut her some slack, mom! Rory was going through something terrible!"
"EMILY: Life is full of terrible things, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: She was emotional when you're emotional, you don't think clearly. I remember a woman who tried to buy a plane when her granddaughter moved out."
"EMILY: I tried to time-share a plane. It is in no way even close to the same thing."
"LORELAI: [The maid comes in] I've never been so happy to see a salad in my entire life."
"[Cut to later in the meal]"
"LORELAI: Ugh! I can't believe what I'm hearing!"
"EMILY: If we'd known the extent of the issue, we might not have taken Rory in."
"LORELAI: I tried to tell you!"
"EMILY: You did not!"
"LORELAI: I came here and I told you exactly what happened with Mitchum, and you didn't want to hear it."
"RICHARD: I don't remember that!"
"EMILY: I don't either!"
"[change of seating]"
"LORELAI: [reenacting the scene, Lorelai is quite worked up] ""The Huntzbergers told her she wasn't good enough, and Mitchum told her she didn't have it."" ""He what?!"" ""Yes, and now she's dropped out of Yale, but the three of us can knock some sense into her."" ""Of course we'll help you. This is not happening."" ""I'll call Charlie Davenport tomorrow."" ""Thank you, guys, so much. Just thank you."" End scene! [Hits the table]"
"[Cut to desert, every]"
"LORELAI: This is really good sorbet."
"EMILY: I know isn't it? Theresa made it herself."
"RORY: Mango?"
"EMILY: Passion fruit."
"LORELAI: Delicious."
"RICHARD: It certainly is."
"[cut to Lorelai and Rory in the dining room drinking coffee, Emily and Richard can be heard shouting off screen]"
"RICHARD: What are you thinking, buying an airplane?!"
"EMILY: I didn't buy it. I looked at it!"
"RICHARD: Well, what were you doing looking at a plane?!"
"EMILY: I can look at a plane if I want to look at a plane!"
"[cut to the living room, everyone is laughing]"
"EMILY: So I lead her over to the good table, smiling like we are the best friends in the world, and I tell her, ""Shira, you don't think Rory ""is good enough to be in your family? ""She is. We are just as good as you are. ""After all, you are nothing but a two-bit gold digger, and how you managed to bag Mitchum I will never know."""
"LORELAI: You did not."
"RICHARD: Oh, yes, she did."
"EMILY: I told her Mitchum still plays around."
"LORELAI: [gasps]"
"RICHARD: Oh, no no no. Tell her exactly what you said."
"EMILY: What did I say?"
"RICHARD: About her weight going...[jesters up and down]"
"EMILY: oh, yes, yes. I got it. I told her, ""Mitchum still plays around, you know."" Well, of course you know. ""That's why your weight goes up and down 30 pounds every 3 months."""
"LORELAI: [excited] Oh my…"
"RICHARD: Ruthless woman! [Laughs]"
"LORELAI: I bow to the foot of the master."
"EMILY: I only wished I'd remembered to call her a cocktail waitress."
"LORELAI: Ooow. That's my mother's version of the ""c"" word."
"[The all laugh again]"
"[cut to the dining room again, Rory and Emily are leaving the kitchen going to the living room.]"
"RORY: I don't want to quit the D.A.R."
"EMILY: Well, too late."
"RORY: I was accepted and certified grandma. You can't just kick me out."
"EMILY: I can to."
"RORY: I know the rules backwards and forward, and I have done nothing to lose my status except argue with you, plus I'm in contact with more members than you are."
"EMILY: That is not true."
"[They reach the living room, Lorelai and Richard and sitting on the couch]"
"RORY: And I like more of the members than you do."
"EMILY: That is not true."
"RORY: I talk to Tweenie Halpern all the time."
"EMILY: What are you doing talking to Tweenie Halpern?"
"RORY: I'm friends with Tweenie Halpern, I'm helping her daughter look at colleges. I'm gonna give her a tour of Yale."
"EMILY: You have no right to talk to Tweenie Halpern or anyone else in the D.A.R. That is my organization. [she walks off]"
"RORY: I'm not quitting!"
"EMILY: Oh, yes, you are!"
"[Rory follows, leaving Lorelai and Richard on the couch.]"
"RICHARD: So, how's Luke?"
"LORELAI: He has a kid."
"[Cut to Lorelai and Emily yelling off screen, Rory and Richard are sitting in the living room.]"
"LORELAI: We were 16! We didn't want to get married!"
"EMILY: When you get pregnant, you get married! A child needs a mother"
"and a father!"
"LORELAI: Oh, my god!"
"[Cut to the later, everyone is sitting in the living room and they all look whipped out, cut to front door exterior. Lorelai and Rory come out, very tired.]"
"LORELAI: Well...I think we've officially reinstated Friday night dinner."
"[They walk off in opposite directions to their own cars]"

"GILMORE MANSION"
"[Lorelai, Rory, Emily and Richard are seated and having dinner. Every one is a little on edge]"
"LORELAI: The roses are amazing, mom."
"EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai."
"RORY: I like them, too, grandma."
"EMILY: Thank you, Rory."
"RICHARD: You are an expert flower arranger, Emily. Perhaps you missed your calling."
"EMILY: Thank you, Richard."
"LORELAI: Well done, everyone. Well done."
"EMILY: Oh, stop it, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: What, I'm just commenting on how nice and civil that moment was. Never mind. Go on, go on. [Smiling] That was so cute."
"RORY: [After a moment] The roses are nice, grandma."
"LORELAI: [A little annoyed] Already covered that. Move on."
"RICHARD: So, Rory, how are things going at Yale?"
"RORY: They're fine."
"EMILY: I didn't know we were allowed to talk about Yale."
"LORELAI: Mom"
"RICHARD: Oh No. We're allowed to talk about it. We're just not allowed to pay for it."
"LORELAI: Dad"
"EMILY: I wonder if we're allowed to visit it."
"LORELAI: Okay, hold on."
"RICHARD: Perhaps if we dress in disguise."
"LORELAI: Guys!"
"EMILY: Plastic nose with glasses attached."
"LORELAI: Hey, come on. We were doing so well there for a while. Then you had to start with the Yale."
"EMILY: So we can't talk about Yale."
"RICHARD: I should make a list. What else am I not allowed to discuss in my house?"
"LORELAI: No, of course you can talk about Yale. Yale is dad's alma mater, and Rory goes there, so we have to talk about it, okay? But maybe not now."
"EMILY: Fine."
"RICHARD: Fine with me."
"LORELAI: Now, I know a lot of stuff has happened, but we all agreed we were gonna put all that behind us and just move on, okay? So let's take a step back and, uh, start again. And 5, 4, 3, 2... these roses are amazing, mom."
"EMILY: Thank you, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: That-a-girl."
"RICHARD: Your mother has a way with flowers. Perhaps she missed her calling."
"LORELAI: Okay Dad, we don't have to have exactly the same conversation we just had."
"RICHARD: How am I supposed to know? You said the same thing you said."
"LORELAI: I was getting the ball rolling."
"RICHARD: Lorelai, this is my house. I should have some control over what goes on here [Raising his voice] at some point!"
"EMILY: You're raising your voice again, Richard."
"RICHARD: I am not!"
"EMILY: You are, and you're raising your voice to me."
"RICHARD: I'm not allowed to [Looking at Rory] raise it to the people who deserve it."
"LORELAI: 5, 4, 3, 2..."
"RICHARD: I love shrimp! Who else loves shrimp?!"
"RORY: Me!"
"LORELAI: I'm a fan!"
"RICHARD: This is ridiculous."
"EMILY: Lorelai, how's Luke?"
"LORELAI: Hey, nice one, mom."
"EMILY: Thank you. [Moment] Well?"
"LORELAI: What? Oh. Oh, he's fine."
"EMILY: So you're still engaged."
"LORELAI: Yes, we're still engaged."
"EMILY: I was just asking. After all, I haven't gotten a ""save the date"" card yet. If you're engaged, I assume you're planning a wedding at some point, not that I've heard anything."
"LORELAI: I will send you a ""save the date"" card, mom."
"EMILY: For?"
"LORELAI: For?"
"EMILY: What date am I saving?"
"LORELAI: Dur, well if I tell you that now, then what fun will the card be?"
"EMILY: I mean, I assume I'm invited. I haven't heard. I haven't heard if I'm invited, if I'm in the wedding, if I need a dress. And now you won't tell me the date of this wedding that I may or may not be invited to."
"LORELAI: June 3rd!"
"EMILY: June 3rd?"
"LORELAI: Yes, June 3rd, okay?"
"EMILY: Are we here June 3rd?"
"RICHARD: I believe we are."
"EMILY: All right. June 3rd. That's very soon."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"EMILY: Is there any specific reason so soon?"
"LORELAI: Oh, boy."
"EMILY: June 3rd. June 3rd? Richard, June 3rd."
"RICHARD: Yes, June 3rd."
"EMILY: Well, it's just so soon. I mean, we haven't even seen Luke since... Richard, when was the last time we saw Luke?"
"RICHARD: It's been a while."
"EMILY: A long while. Well, you must bring him to dinner Friday."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: The next time we see him certainly cannot be as you're walking down the aisle."
"LORELAI: Well, there's time before…"
"EMILY: No, there's not. Your father goes out of town every other week from now until the end of may, I have functions every weekend, two charity balls, the zoo auction, the Hartford beautification project. Your father and I bought a stretch of the highway."
"RICHARD: Exit 36 through 38."
"EMILY: So there's literally no time left. It has to be Friday."
"RICHARD: Friday it is."
"LORELAI: I don't know if Luke is available Friday."
"EMILY: Well tell him he has to be. This is family."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but…"
"EMILY: He would say no to having dinner with his future mother and father-in-law? Is this really the kind of man you want in your life? Is this really the kind of man you want to be Rory's stepfather?"
"RORY: Yeah, think of the kids."
"LORELAI: Luke is not saying no."
"EMILY: You are?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm not saying no, either."
"EMILY: So no one's saying no."
"LORELAI: Right."
"EMILY: So you're saying yes."
"LORELAI: Yes."
"EMILY: Good. I'll pick up some ""save the date"" cards tomorrow. Do you want a color? Because I think white is the best choice."
"RORY: 5, 4, 3, 2..."
"OPENING CREDITS"
"KITCHEN OF LOREAI (AND LUKE'S) HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is putting frozen food on trays]"
"LORELAI: Hey, have you noticed that anything in a red-wine reduction sauce leaves you hungry 20 minutes later?"
"RORY: [OS] Especially if you don't eat it."
"LORELAI: Did my parents eat exceptionally slowly tonight?"
"RORY: [OS] Yes."
"LORELAI: They did. My mother started on the white-meat portion of her game hen at 8:15 and did not hit the drumstick till 10 O' nine."
"RORY: [OS] Actually 9:15."
"LORELAI: You've been in there an hour. What are you doing?"
"RORY: [OS] Facial exercises. The younger I look, the younger you look."
"LORELAI: Oh, good point. Hey, do we want the apple turnovers or the cherry?"
"RORY: [OS] Yes. [Moment] Hey, question, where did June 3rd come from?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: [OS] I thought there was no June 3rd."
"LORELAI: No, there's a June 3rd. Just because we don't get married on a date doesn't make it cease to exist."
"RORY: [OS] You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: I was on the spot. I just didn't want to go through the whole ""the wedding was postponed"" explanation."
"RORY: [OS] Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because that would lead to the ""what happened?"" Conversation, which would lead to the ""I told you so"" conversation and the ""what is wrong with you that you can't close the deal?"" Conversation, which would lead to the ""why is Lorelai slamming her head against the wall?"" Conversation. So I just said June 3rd. It could still happen, and if it doesn't, I'll blow up that bridge when we come to it."
"[Rory comes out of her room]"
"RORY: I get it."
"LORELAI: Thank you. Those new sweats?"
"RORY: Yep, just came out."
"LORELAI: Did you get some for mommy?"
"RORY: You want some Yale sweats?"
"LORELAI: No, no, not me, your other mommy, the one who raised you and fed you and stayed up with you when you had the measles."
"RORY: I already put them in your room."
"LORELAI: Excellent! [Handing Rory a pop-tart] To cleanse your palate."
"RORY: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Let's go."
"[They go into the living room and sit on the couch and turn on the TV]"
"LORELAI: Hey, you know who also might like a sweatshirt?"
"RORY: They don't make them for dogs. I already asked."
"LORELAI: I did not mean Paul Anka. He's a Princeton man, anyhow."
"RORY: Nice loyalty."
"LORELAI: I think Christopher might like one."
"RORY: Dad? Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, he's paying your tuition now. It might be a nice gesture."
"RORY: Yeah, sure, I could do that."
"LORELAI: Cool. ""Solaris""?"
"RORY: No, not again."
"LORELAI: I'm telling you, there's a story in there somewhere."
"RORY: Yeah, the story is you calling yourself Mrs. Clooney for 2 1/2 hours."
"LORELAI: Have you heard from him lately?"
"RORY: George? Yes, last night. The Oscar buzz is really getting to him."
"LORELAI: I'm talking about your dad."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: Nothing. He's just been very quiet lately."
"RORY: So?"
"LORELAI: So it's weird. Pops up and then disappears again, that's never good."
"RORY: Unless he's a groundhog. Maybe dad's a groundhog."
"LORELAI: I wonder what he's up to."
"RORY: Maybe he's just busy with work."
"LORELAI: No, I don't buy it."
"RORY: Well maybe he's just doing what he promised he would do."
"LORELAI: What's that?"
"RORY: He's putting up the money and staying out of everything else."
"LORELAI: Hmm. Well, that was the agreement, wasn't it?"
"RORY: Yes, it was."
"LORELAI: Huh. Maybe he is just doing what we agreed to. So un-Christopher of him."
"RORY: People change, and then they get a nice sweatshirt as a treat."
"LORELAI: Good for him."
"RORY: Yep. Hey, ""b*ll*ts over Broadway."""
"LORELAI: ""Don't speak."""
"RORY: If only."
"LORELAI: [Gasps] Hey, you like me. Remember that."
"RORY: Hmm."
"LORELAI: Why don't you invite him to Yale for lunch, show him around the campus, make him feel daddy-ish?"
"RORY: You think he'd like that?"
"LORELAI: I think he'd love that."
"RORY: Okay. I'll call him tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Just don't take him to the library."
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Don't show him all your classes. Don't make him touch the toe."
"RORY: This is my tour."
"LORELAI: I'm just saying, if he passes out from boredom, he's gonna be a lot harder to drag around campus than I was."
"RORY: Seriously, don't speak."
"YALE NEWSPAPER ROOM"
"[The staff are gathered around]"
"SHEILA: This is getting ridiculous."
"BILL: Well I'm completely out of ideas."
"SHEILA: How about we call her cell phone and make up some kind of emergency? Would that work?"
"[Rory enter the room]"
"RORY: Okay, hit me with it."
"AK: Big shock, it's about Paris."
"RORY: What did she do now?"
"BILL: Nothing, it's what's been done to her."
"JONI: The Howell Raines-ing is complete."
"RORY: She's out?"
"BILL: The board has spoken."
"JONI: More like screamed."
"RORY: Oh, boy. How did she take it?"
"SHEILA: She hasn't."
"JONI: She won't come out of her bunker."
"AK: She's been in there for hours."
"BILL: Even h*tler came out every once in a while to walk his dog."
"JONI: I interrupted her highness while she was on the phone and got a 5,000-word lecture on Robert's rules of order."
"RORY: Well, she's got to be told."
"AK: Then she's got to come out."
"JONI: Tear gas! Where can we find tear gas?"
"SHEILA: Or we could set off the fire alarm."
"RORY: Stand down, everyone. I'll tell her."
"BILL: Really?"
"RORY: It's probably better that the person delivering the news doesn't chuckle with glee while doing it, Bill."
"BILL: [Chuckling] I would not chuckle while doing it. Oh, my god, that was completely inadvertent."
"RORY: All right, I'm going in."
"[Inside Paris's bunker, Paris sitting with her feet on the chair and her legs tucked up to her chest, she is on the phone.]"
"PARIS: I know, Mr. Weisner. It was a complete screw-up. Here's what happened, your ad ran with the phone number of the beauty-supply-store ad from the next page. That's why you're getting calls about hair gel and moisturizers. Anyway, I really want you to rest easy, and I hope this does not interfere with any financial contributions that you've been generous enough to promise. All right? Thank you. Bye. [Hangs up phone] This job is 24/7."
"RORY: Yeah."
"PARIS: It's not enough to put out a daily paper with outstanding quality, without having to dodge complaints from uppity alumni calling over every little mistake. Weisner threatened to withhold money he had already pledged for the new computers because his ad was messed up. I mean can he even do that?"
"RORY: I don't know."
"PARIS: [Moving to a hot plate] Do you want some soup? I was just heating up some soup."
"RORY: There's no ventilation in here."
"PARIS: I'm careful."
"RORY: Right. Uh, well, no, thank you. I just came in here to... I was just thinking..."
"PARIS: yeah?"
"RORY: [Sighs] Five-plus years?"
"PARIS: Hmm."
"RORY: That we've known each other, that we've been friends. Five-plus."
"PARIS: That long? Wow."
"RORY: Feels like forever ago to me, Chilton, the day we met, just a couple of rosy-cheeked kids."
"PARIS: My face inflamed easily back then, too many tomatoes and red peppers."
"RORY: Got off to kind of a rocky start. We were competitors."
"PARIS: I get that from my mother. She's part Viking."
"RORY: But eventually we became pals, good pals, because we respected each other and supported each other in good times and bad."
"PARIS: Did I open this can today or yesterday?"
"RORY: This is a not-so-good time, Paris."
"PARIS: I know. If the hurricanes don't k*ll us, the bird flu will."
"RORY: I mean for you, here, at the paper. [Paris looks at Rory] The board voted you out."
"PARIS: Oh…I see. [Moves away from the hotplate and soup] So it's over."
"RORY: I'm sorry. I just found out. I'm so sorry."
"PARIS: Well, it's not like I didn't have a clue that that was a possibility."
"RORY: It has been pretty tense around here."
"PARIS: So, are they all out there excitedly awaiting my perp walk?"
"RORY: Oh, who cares? Who cares about them? You don't perp walk. You're Paris Geller. You walk tall. You're better than all of them."
"PARIS: Really?"
"RORY: Definitely. And this job, Paris, being editor, you don't need this, this hassle. You're gonna be a doctor."
"PARIS: Surgeon."
"RORY: And a lawyer."
"PARIS: Judge."
"RORY: That's a hell of a workload. And the workload here, the indignities, smoothing the ruffled feathers of advertisers, covering sports as if they matter, you're exhausted, Paris, stretched thin, eating soup out of a can."
"PARIS: Soup I don't even like."
"RORY: This might not be such a bad thing, leaving this job, huh?"
"PARIS: I am pretty tired."
"RORY: You even look a little relieved."
"PARIS: And I'll be damned if I'm gonna give those people a perp walk."
"RORY: Good. Good attitude."
"PARIS: Let's get out of this spider hole and take care of this right now."
"RORY: I am with you, friend. You better shut off the hot plate."
"PARIS: Right."
"[Back in the newsroom]"
"PARIS: Everyone, I have a little announcement, so if you could gather around, please. We have an issue. You see, it has become increasingly apparent that I have become the story here at the Yale daily news and that I have overshadowed our journalistic efforts. Well, I don't want to be the story at my own newspaper, because then I'd be Judith Miller, and I'd have to wear my bangs too long and overdo my lipstick, and I don't want that. I want to remain me. So I am tendering my resignation as editor in chief effective immediately. In closing, I'd like to state that the Yale daily news has overcome numerous obstacles in its august history and that it will easily overcome this. My resignation will be a loss, but it will be a loss the daily news can survive, and it is a loss it must survive. Good night and good luck."
"[Paris leaves the newsroom. Bill moves the Paris name of the location board Paris set up. Cheers and applause, as Rory looks on with concern]"
"DRAGON FLY INN – RESEPTION AREA"
"[Luke is working on the ""key rack"" behind the desk. Lorelai is also there, sorting mail.]"
"LUKE: [Sighs] I don't want to go."
"LORELAI: Of course you don't."
"LUKE: Your parents are not warm people."
"LORELAI: They were extras in ""March of the penguins."""
"LUKE: Maybe we could skip the drinks, have the dinner, and be done."
"LORELAI: Skip the drinks! Luke, you don't skip the one activity that makes the rest of the evening miraculously tolerable. The drinks fortify us. The drinks give us strength. The drinks get us drunk."
"LUKE: But they take forever, and then I got to sit there and talk to your dad about stocks and literature and watch it dawn on him for the umpteenth time that I don't know anything about stocks or literature. How many times can two people have the same awful conversation?"
"LORELAI: Just repeat after me, ""this is really great scotch, Richard."""
"LUKE: And then, of course, there's your mother, who hates me."
"LORELAI: All the more reason to get a little soused."
"LUKE: We can drink in the car."
"LORELAI: One of us has to drive."
"LUKE: Fine, you drink in the car, I'll take five quick shots in their driveway."
"LORELAI: Look, I want to get out of there as quickly as you do, but we have to think a little more pragmatically. So when the dessert comes, I will fake an attack of food poisoning, and then you rush me to the car."
"LUKE: That's your solution?"
"LORELAI: Uh-huh, yes. Fake stomach pain is my specialty, that and getting my fiancé to agree to horrible things he hates."
"LUKE: 6 O'clock?"
"LORELAI: Wear something fetching."
"[Lorelai walks toward the dinning room]"
"MICHEL: What is Luke doing here?"
"LORELAI: Oh, he's making a few minor repairs around the inn."
"MICHEL: What about the handyman?"
"LORELAI: Parker?"
"MICHEL: Yes. I thought we liked him."
"LORELAI: We do, but Luke offered, and he has his own tool belt, and the price was right."
"MICHEL: Oh, really? No charge?"
"LORELAI: No, well, I did have to give him a coupon for 100 free snuggles."
"MICHEL: How adorable."
"LORELAI: Yeah, and to tell the truth, parker always kind of turned up his nose at my snuggle bucks."
"MICHEL: So I guess this is how we're operating now."
"LORELAI: How's that?"
"MICHEL: We've dispensed with hiring professionals around here. Maybe from now on, my cousin Gert can do our accounting. She's got her own calculator."
"LORELAI: He's not performing open-heart surgery, Michel. He's just fixing a few things, for free, saving me a little money so I can do crazy things like pay people's salary and heat the place."
"MICHEL: Well, he's not doing a very good job. That key rack is protruding way too far out. It's going to wreak havoc on my French cuffs every time I reach for a key."
"LORELAI: Tell him how you like the hooks."
"MICHEL: Oh, I'm supposed to just follow him around all day, correcting his every mistake? Absurd. We will sit down and make a detailed list of everything we need done, and he can consult that."
"LORELAI: Luke does not need a list."
"MICHEL: What do you mean? We always gave parker a list."
"LORELAI: Luke's got a sixth sense about these things. He can spot a loose screw from across the room. He can sense when something needs to be fixed before it's even broken, it's spooky."
"MICHEL: Well, I will do a quick walk-through with him, just to make sure his magical powers are working."
"LORELAI: Michel, there's no need for that. You've got plenty to handle with all the guests, and Luke's got it covered."
"LUKE: [Walking past] Left my sandpaper in the library."
"MICHEL: It must be nice to have a man who isn't ashamed of his own natural body odor."
"[Lorelai give Michel a dirty look and walks away]"
"YALE NEWSROOM"
"[Lots of staff around to vote for the new editor]"
"MAN 1: Come on."
"BILL: I'm trying to be accurate."
"JONI: There are no ""hanging chads"", Bill. Give us the count."
"BILL: Okay, we've got 16 votes for Casey, 18 for Andrew, and 9 for Cathy."
"[The newsroom sighs in disbelief.]"
"AK: I can't do this anymore!"
"MAN1: We're never going to get a majority!"
"SHEILA: Let's just not have an editor. We can run the paper by committee."
"BILL: No one said this was going to be easy."
"JONI: It's been three days of voting. That's not an election, that's a sentence."
"RORY: Maybe we should take a break."
"BILL: No. No breaks."
"AK: This isn't est. We get to leave."
"RORY: Well then maybe we should send out for coffee. Who wants coffee?"
"JONI: No way! I'm so wired, I'm jumping out of my skin!"
"SHEILA: We have three candidates and no consensus. We're never getting out of here."
"MAN1: We need a new name."
"RORY: I agree. We're not getting anywhere."
"BILLY: How about Gilmore?"
"JONI: I like that name."
"AK: I like that name."
"RORY: Whoa, hey, I didn't mean my name."
"SHELIA: I'd vote for Rory before I'd switch to Andrew. Sorry, Andrew."
"BILL: And I'd vote for Rory before I'd switch to Cathy. Sorry, Cathy."
"AK: And I'd vote for anybody over Casey because Casey's an idiot and he didn't even show up."
"BILL: He's in the back."
"AK: Sorry, Casey."
"BILL: Got a statement, Gilmore?"
"RORY: No, um...I'd just like to say I'm flattered, and you're very kind. Um, I did miss that semester, so seniority's a question."
"JONI: We're past taking seniority into account."
"SHEILA: You totally bailed us out that night."
"AK: The paper wouldn't have gone out if it weren't for you."
"RORY: But…"
"BILL: What's your hesitation? Is it Paris?"
"RORY: No, I'm not hesitating because of Paris."
"BILL: Then why are you hesitating?"
"RORY: I'm not. I accept the nomination."
"SHEILA: Please tell me we don't have to debate this."
"JONI: What's the debate? She's feeling pretty consensus-y to me."
"BILL: All right. All those in favor of Rory Gilmore as editor, say aye."
"[The raise there hands together and say Aye!]"
"BILL: Sounds consensus-y to me. Congratulations."
"RORY: Thank you, everyone. I won't let you down."
"[Everyone starts to move away]"
"BILL: This is part two of the financial-aid feature. We need your okay before going to layout."
"RORY: Good. I loved part one, by the way."
"BILL: Thanks."
"SHELIA: A.P. Pieces. We may need more filler than usual today."
"RORY: Good. Thanks, Sheila."
"JONI: These should probably come first, photo approvals."
"RORY: Thanks, Joni. And let Derek know that I'm gonna need some space"
"in editorial. I want to write a little note from me to the readers."
"JONI: [Salutes in fun] Will do."
"HALLWAY TO THE PARIS, DOYLE AND RORY APARTMENT"
"[Rory gasps as she sees all her stuff in the hall]"
"RORY: [Starts to climb over stuff to get to the apartment door] Ow. [Starts to unlock the door but the keys don't work] Paris! Doyle! Someone!"
"PARIS: [The door opens] You dare show your face?"
"RORY: What is my stuff doing out here?"
"PARIS: I'll prorate the utilities from the time of eviction, 3:47 P.M., The third day of February."
"RORY: Eviction? Paris, why are you doing this?"
"PARIS: Don't you play dumb with me!"
"RORY: Unchain the door."
"PARIS: This chain is here for your protection. Krav Maga, baby. When my enemies approach, I'm trained to pounce, it's reflex."
"RORY: Paris, I'm not your enemy."
"PARIS: Oh, really? Enemies move in silence and strike when their prey is weakest. Pretty much sums you up, doesn't it, editor Gilmore?"
"RORY: That was not my doing. That was the board's."
"PARIS: As if you didn't lobby for it."
"RORY: I didn't!"
"PARIS: That secret meeting weeks ago at the pub where you set the putsch in motion, what happened? There wasn't a beer hall available?"
"RORY: I did not set the poochin motion. I can't even spell ""pooch."""
"PARIS: Nice spin. Take it to ""k"" street. [Shuts the door] I made you my number two, and it went to your head!"
"RORY: You can't just kick me out like this!"
"PARIS: There's a hallway full of crap that says otherwise!"
"RORY: But we're friends."
"PARIS: [Opens the door, still chained] We're not friends."
"RORY: I understand why you're upset, but just let me in so I can explain."
"PARIS: [Mocking voice] ""Gee, Paris, what a horrible job being editor is. ""Who needs the headache? Remember Chilton, Paris? All those good times."" Well, the good times are over! [Closes the door, Rory is still in shock, door re opens] Here, this is yours, too. [Throws a scarf at Rory through the chained door.]"
"DRAGON FLY INN – DINNING ROOM"
"[Luke is fixing a chair]"
"MICHEL: [Upset] Luke, can we talk for a minute?"
"LUKE: [Calm] Yeah, what's up?"
"MICHEL: I noticed your truck,"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"MICHEL: Your filthy green truck."
"LUKE: Uh-huh"
"MICHEL: It's parked in guest parking."
"LUKE: So?"
"MICHEL: So guest parking is for guests. Filthy-green-truck parking is around the back, on the dirt road, behind the shed."
"LUKE: I'll be done in two minutes."
"MICHEL: Wonderful. Now, about your hat."
"LUKE: My hat?"
"MICHEL: I'd like you to remove it."
"LUKE: What for?"
"MICHEL: You're indoors. Gentlemen don't wear hats indoors."
"LUKE: It's okay. I'm not much of a gentleman."
"MICHEL: Not if you persist in dressing like a ""peanuts"" character."
"LUKE: I'm not taking off my hat."
"MICHEL: Did you talk to a guest this morning?"
"LUKE: Huh?"
"MICHEL: I thought I saw you talking to a guest."
"LUKE: I may have given someone directions."
"MICHEL: Well, don't do it again. You're not qualified."
"LUKE: I'm not qualified to tell somebody how to get to the post office?"
"MICHEL: No. You are a diner owner and an amateur substitute handyman, and that in no way qualifies you to give directions to our guests."
"LUKE: Why not?"
"MICHEL: [Getting mad] Because that is my job, and you lack my people k*ll!"
"LUKE: [Getting a little annoyed but still calm] Go away, Michel."
"MICHEL: [Still mad] Keep your voice down. The guests can hear."
"LUKE: There isn't anyone down here."
"MICHEL: But they are upstairs, and your voice carries!"
"LUKE: Hey, you're the one doing the yelling."
"MICHEL: I'm yelling because you are flouting the rules of this establishment, parking where you want, talking when you want, wearing what you want. And 20 minutes ago, I saw you eating a sandwich."
"LUKE: So what?"
"MICHEL: We don't let the help eat in front of the guests! The next time you eat, you do so in the kitchen... or the barn!"
"LUKE: I'm not gonna eat in the barn!"
"MICHEL: Parker ate in the barn."
"LUKE: Who's parker?"
"MICHEL: A wonderful, wonderful man. [Storms off]"
"OUTSIDE PARIS & DOYLE'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory is mad, looking through a news paper and dials her cell phone]"
"LOGAN: Hello?"
"RORY: There are no singles left."
"LOGAN: What do you mean ""no singles""?"
"RORY: I just talked to campus housing, and there are no singles left at Branford or anywhere on campus, and the decent off-campus apartments are long gone. The ones left make Paris and Doyle's place look like Versailles."
"LOGAN: What are you talking about. Why do you need a place?"
"RORY: I got elected editor of the daily news."
"LOGAN: What?… You did?"
"RORY: Yes."
"LOGAN: Wow! Finally someone good running that place! Someone great! You're gonna be great!"
"RORY: Well, hot-plate Harriet took it very badly."
"LOGAN: Who's that?"
"RORY: Paris. She threw all my stuff out into the hallway, so I'm sitting here guarding it all until the movers get here."
"LOGAN: Oh, man. Paris, idiot."
"RORY: My books look sad. Can books look sad?"
"LOGAN: Look, we'll figure this out. You said you got movers?"
"RORY: Starving students. How starving can they be if they can't come for five hours after you call? Plus, I heard the guy crunching on something during our call. Sounded like baked lay's."
"LOGAN: And you've got nowhere to go, right?"
"RORY: Right-a-mundo."
"LOGAN: Well...you can move in with me."
"RORY: What?"
"LOGAN: Move in with me. Paris' place is a hole anyway. I never liked that you lived there. And that doo-wop group downstairs, I don't think they're an honest-to-goodness singing group."
"RORY: Logan, that's really sweet, but I can't move in with you."
"LOGAN: Why not? You're here half the time anyway. You've already got two dresser drawers, and right now, for a limited time, I'll throw in three more drawers and a set of Ginsu knives."
"RORY: Really?"
"LOGAN: No. I have no idea where to get Ginsu knives."
"RORY: It's kind of a big step, isn't it?"
"LOGAN: You need a place, I got the space. Don't you think it'll be fun?"
"RORY: Fun?"
"LOGAN: Come on, ace. You know what I mean. What do you say?"
"RORY: Well... I might need just one more drawer. I can put my socks in a shoebox under the bed."
"LOGAN: Is that a yes?"
"RORY: I guess that's a yes."
"LOGAN: Good. I'm calling Colin and Finn. They'll be right over."
"RORY: Okay."
"LOGAN: And no shoeboxes. You're getting those drawers."
"RORY: I'll take them. [A lady comes out of apartment 8, to the lady] Wait, wait! [To Logan] Hold on, I've got to take this. [Back to the lady] Okay, get past the hamper, veer left at the mirror. Grab the large pipe on the wall to get yourself to the desk, which you can then go over or under. I'll guide you from there."
"DRAGON FLY INN – KITCHEN"
"[Michel is getting some food and Lorelai walks in, Michel is still in a bad mood]"
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Got a little snack there, Michel?"
"These are not a snack. They are my 12 daily free walnuts."
"LORELAI: I hate to see you bingeing like this."
"And now I've lost count."
"LORELAI: Let's talk about your little spat with Luke today."
"What did he tell you?"
"LORELAI: He said you yelled at him."
"Oh! [Scoffs] What a crybaby."
"LORELAI: He's not a crybaby. He just doesn't like being screamed at by people he's doing favors for."
"Did you check his diaper? Maybe he's just upset because you forgot to change him today."
"LORELAI: Now who's a crybaby?"
"I used to yell at parker all the time, and he never once came running to you."
"LORELAI: What is this thing with you and parker? Did he save your life in Nam?"
"Parker is a professional."
"LORELAI: Parker is a clumsy, forgetful, 65-year-old, semi-lucid, not-that-handy handyman."
"Luke wears a hat indoors."
"LORELAI: So did parker."
"That was a wool-knit cap. It's completely different."
"LORELAI: So this is a hat thing?"
"I just don't like Luke's system. He misses many things that needs to be fixed, many things."
"LORELAI: Well, so jot them down."
"That's not how we make the list."
"LORELAI: So type them up."
"No! We make the list at Weston's over coffee. That's what we do when we make the list. We go once a month to Weston's together, and we sit, and we decide on the work for the handyman. That's our thing. We get very large coffees, and we split a slice of red-velvet cake, and we gossip, and I eat the whole cake, and you never tell anyone."
"LORELAI: Oh, Michel. I liked our trips to Weston's."
"Oh, yes, that is what I do when I like something, I cut it out of my life completely."
"LORELAI: I didn't cut coffee with you out of my life."
"Oh, then you just forgot? How special those times must have been for you."
"LORELAI: They were special. It's just been crazy around here, and, well, it was nice to save a little money with Luke."
"Money isn't everything, you know. People come to work for more than just the money. Although my direct deposit was late again. Maybe that's something you can finally get around to looking into."
"LORELAI: I will."
"I guess you don't have to write that down, either? No one needs a list anymore?"
"LORELAI: [picks up a walnuts] These are candied."
"Well...the real ones taste like cardboard, and the health benefits are the same, except for the skin."
"LORELAI: What are you doing this afternoon?"
"I'm going to yell at Doreen about the soap spots on room 3's bathroom floor tiles."
"LORELAI: Well, instead, how about if you and I take a trip to Weston's? We can make Luke a list over cake and coffee, and we can throw around ideas about improvements at the inn."
"I do not need your pity cake."
"LORELAI: It's not pity cake, it's red-velvet cake, and it's delicious, and I think we ought to eat it. Although this time, you're getting your own 'cause I am not sharing."
"Well, I guess I could yell at Doreen tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Tomorrow seems like a fine day to yell at Doreen. So Weston's?"
"Weston's… I was thinking maybe you could have Luke wear a jumpsuit when he's working around the inn, you know, the kind gas-station attendant's wear."
"LORELAI: Yeah, why don't we put a pin in that?"

"YALE"
"[Rory is showing Christopher around the campus, they are in a hall way]"
"CHRISTOPHER: So far, I have seen no one here smarter than you."
"RORY: You can tell that?"
"CHRISTOPHER: And I'm keeping track, 566 people, all inferior to you."
"RORY: I don't believe it."
"CHRISTOPHER: What?"
"RORY: Did you not see those two girls?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No. What?"
"RORY: They totally checked you out."
"CHRISTOPHER: They did? [Chuckles] Cool."
"RORY: It's the same way with mom. I swear, I hate having hot parents."
"CHRISTOPHER: Sorry."
"RORY: Check it out. [The look in to a class room from a doorway] I had him for microeconomics last year."
"PROFESSOR COPPEDGE: The currency must be more than fungible, but also scarce. Take our seashells example. While fungible, they exist in infinite supply and so fail the scarcity test."
"CHRISTOPHER: [Snoring]"
"RORY: Dad!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Huh? What? Uh, uh, fungible?"
"RORY: Dad, that's a Nobel-prize winner."
"CHRISTOPHER: The dull dude?"
"RORY: Shh!"
"CHRISTOPHER: He doesn't even own an iron."
"RORY: I can't take you anywhere."
"CHRISTOPHER: No, you can't, can you?"
"YALE – DINNING HALL"
"CHRISTOPHER: This where we're eating?"
"RORY: We don't have to. I just wanted you to see it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I'll eat wherever you want to eat."
"RORY: Okay. I know a cool spot. And we've pretty much covered every square inch of campus. So let's go."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, what about your place?"
"RORY: My place?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I want to see it."
"RORY: Why?"
"CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles] Because I'm curious. I want to see where my kid lives."
"RORY: Well, it's pretty messy right now."
"CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles] The lady who cleans my house has to use a bulldozer. Messy does not frighten me."
"RORY: Okay. But you've been warned."
"CHRISTOPHER: Lead the way."
"LAGAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING"
"[The elevator doors open, Rory and Chris get out and walk down a hall way]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Man, did you see that lobby?"
"RORY: Um, yeah. Once or twice."
"CHRISTOPHER: That was a lobby. And a doorman? I'm slipping that guy a little something extra to keep an eye on you, by the way."
"RORY: You don't have to do that."
"CHRISTOPHER: Are you kidding? I love slipping people money to do things. We're here?"
"RORY: Yep."
"CHRISTOPHER: You got a key or is it scanning your retina for access?"
"RORY: Dad, I have to be straight with you about something."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oops."
"RORY: No, it's just... today was a weird day. It started really great, with me getting voted editor in chief of my school paper."
"CHRISTOPHER: What? You did? Oh, boy, Rory, that's amazing."
"RORY: Thank you, it is. It's just, Paris, my roommate Paris, she was the editor, Um, but when she found out that I was made the new editor, she threw me out."
"CHRISTOPHER: What? You want me to talk to her?"
"RORY: No, it's fine. It's just that I had no place to go, so I moved in with my boyfriend."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh."
"RORY: In there."
"CHRISTOPHER: Your boyfriend."
"RORY: You actually met him once."
"CHRISTOPHER: I did?"
"RORY: At grandma's vow renewal. He was the guy…"
"CHRISTOPHER: Right."
"RORY: Yes."
"CHRISTOPHER: When I walked in, and you two…"
"RORY: Exactly."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, well, uh, why don't we open the door so I can see what my daughter living with her boyfriend looks like?"
"RORY: Okay."
"[Rory opens the door, they enter, Logan has headphones on and is reading on the couch. Rory gets his attention.]"
"LOGAN: Hey."
"RORY: Hi. I tried to call you to let you know we were coming over, but you didn't answer."
"LOGAN: Right. Headphones."
"RORY: They work."
"LOGAN: Sure do."
"RORY: So, uh, Logan, this is my father, Christopher."
"LOGAN: Hi, good to meet you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Actually, we've met."
"LOGAN: I know."
"CHRISTOPHER: Don't worry about it…Wow, this is, uh, some spread."
"LOGAN: Aw, thanks. [Quietly to Rory] You brought your dad here."
"RORY: He wanted to see where I lived. What was I supposed to do?"
"LOGAN: But I need a little bit of a warning."
"RORY: I tried to call you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Should I put the headphones on? 'Cause I'm right here."
"RORY: No. Sorry."
"LOGAN: Yeah, sorry."
"CHRISTOPHER: Look, I didn't mean to barge in on you like this. I just want to make sure my kid's got a decent place to live, that's all. Hey, so, how do you like the plasma?"
"LOGAN: Love it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm thinking about getting a 60-inch for the bedroom."
"LOGAN: Well, I've got a great home-theater guy if you need some help."
"CHRISTOPHER: I may take you up on that."
"RORY: You want something to drink, dad?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sure, I'll take a soda, if you got one."
"RORY: Coming right up."
"CHRISTOPHER: [Looks out the window] Wow. That's a great view."
"LOGAN: Yeah, that's the old campus over there."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, me and the old campus go way back. [Looks at a photo] Is that...it is. That's Endicott Peabody. [Chuckles] Why do you have that? Are you a Groton man?"
"LOGAN: Was, briefly. I actually swiped that from the headmaster's office on my way out the door."
"CHRISTOPHER: I was kicked out of Groton."
"LOGAN: You're kidding."
"CHRISTOPHER: Nope, did a semester at St. Sebastian's after that."
"LOGAN: I know several people who got kicked out of St. Sebastian's. My good friend Colin was actually banned from coming anywhere within a 10-mile radius."
"CHRISTOPHER: Impressive."
"RORY: Here you go."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. After St. Sebastian's, I went on to St. Cybil's."
"LOGAN: I almost went there myself, but I wound up at St. Mark's instead."
"CHRISTOPHER: How long you last there?"
"LOGAN: About a week."
"CHRISTOPHER: They got quite the trigger finger at St. Mark's. Did you ever do Deerfield?"
"LOGAN: Please, Deerfield's for amateurs. I got kicked out of rivers."
"CHRISTOPHER: I didn't think rivers kicked anybody out."
"LOGAN: Neither did we, but dean Eldon's Miata in the bottom of lake Rutherford proved just the ticket."
"CHRISTOPHER: Rory, you got a good man here."
"RORY: Interesting yardstick you're using."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, listen, Logan, we were just about to go out and grab some dinner. You want to come with?"
"LOGAN: Oh, I don't want to intrude."
"RORY: No, come. That would be great."
"LOGAN: Okay, sure. Just let me grab my wallet. I'll be right with you."
"RORY: You're being nice to him."
"CHRISTOPHER: He's a cool guy."
"RORY: Listen, I haven't had a chance to tell mom about this yet. It's not a big deal, it just happened so fast so…"
"CHRISTOPHER: I get it."
"RORY: I'm gonna tell her about it today, so just..."
"CHRISTOPHER: You tell her. I'm going TV shopping."
"LOGAN: Okay, Rich Man's Shoe."
"RORY: Where else?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Rich man's shoe?"
"RORY: Best burgers within walking distance."

"LORELAI: Actually, that last page we did front and back."
"LUKE: Wow."
"LORELAI: I thought we'd make it an even 100."
"LUKE: [Reading from list] ""Regrout the tiles behind the sink basin."""
"LORELAI: Long overdue."
"LUKE: How can you tell?"
"LORELAI: Well, if you slide on your back under the sink and shine a flashlight up into the area where the basin meets the wall, it's really obvious."
"LUKE: What does ""O.D.D."" Mean?"
"LORELAI: ""Only during the day."" Those are tasks we deemed too noisy for you to do when guests are sleeping."
"LUKE: How considerate. ""Replace chocolate-brown contact paper in kitchen drawers with cocoa brown."""
"LORELAI: Huh, okay, that one I blame on the second piece of cake. There was a major sugar rush involved."
"LUKE: I hate this list."
"LORELAI: I know, but Michel and I made that list together, and we bonded, and that makes him happy."
"LUKE: I don't want to make him happy."
"LORELAI: If Michel's happy, then I'm happy, and then I take all that happiness and I give it right back to you, tonight, in bed, after you spend four hours with my parents. What do you say?"

"LORELAI: No."

"EMILY: Thank you. [The maid brings Lorelai a martini] Number three?"
"LORELAI: Hmm?"
"EMILY: The martini."
"LORELAI: It helps settle my stomach."
"EMILY: Gin?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely. Helps counteract the oh-so-regrettable shrimp I had for lunch today."
"LUKE: Yeah, you mentioned that before. The shrimp did not agree with you."
"LORELAI: Might have to turn in early. Damn, that Al!"
"EMILY: Al?"
"LORELAI: Al's pancake world, where I had the shrimp."
"EMILY: You ate shrimp at a pancake house? Well, of course your stomach's unsettled."
"RICHARD: You should drink club soda."
"LUKE: I think we have some at the house."
"LORELAI: Yeah might have to cut the night a little short."
"EMILY: So you're living at Lorelai's house, Luke?"
"LORELAI: Mother!"
"EMILY: Is that so private?"
"LUKE: No, we're in the process of consolidating things."
"RICHARD: Consolidating your assets?"
"LUKE: Right."
"RICHARD: Tricky business."
"EMILY: Is that house big enough for the two of you?"
"LORELAI: I've remodeled a little, added some space."
"RICHARD: Smart."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, we're smart today."
"LUKE: Except when you ate that shrimp."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that was dumb."
"RICHARD: You've updated your coverage, I assume, let your insurance company know about the improvements?"
"LORELAI: You're my insurance company, dad."
"RICHARD: For the inn, not your house."

"RICHARD: You should do it soon."
"LORELAI: I'll do it tomorrow."
"LUKE: If you're feeling okay."
"LORELAI: Right"
"RICHARD: Better not wait. Small gaps in your insurance coverage can lead to big mistakes. Oh, I could tell you horror stories."
"EMILY: Brian hunter."
"RICHARD: Yes. He owned a home for 40 years, huge mansion, never updated his coverage. One night, his trophy bimbo wife got into a drunken snit, lit a curtain on fire with her marijuana cigarette, and b*rned the place to the ground. He couldn't afford to rebuild. Lost his fortune, lost the bimbo."
"EMILY: Now he sells sunglasses out of the back of a van in California, cheap ones."
"RICHARD: Because he didn't update his coverage. [Turns to Luke[ What about your diner?"
"LORELAI: What about it, dad?"
"RICHARD: I'm just wondering if Luke's insurance is up to date."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, did you invite us over to sell us insurance? Because if you did, I'm going to insist on seeing the complimentary desk calendar first."
"RICHARD: I'm simply inquiring."
"LUKE: I think I'm all up to date."
"RICHARD: What company are you with?"
"LUKE: North trust insurance. I've known the guy a long time."
"RICHARD: Never heard of it. You sure he's legit?"
"LORELAI: Of course it's legit. Come on, dad."
"RICHARD: Don't be naive. There are schemers about preying on the naive."
"EMILY: John Kendall."
"RICHARD: John was drinking at a party, met a fellow, switched all of his coverage to the guy, wrote him a huge check on the spot. Then he suffered earthquake damage, and there was no record of the insurance transaction. It was a scam. Now he's working at the gift shop at the Grand Ole Opry."
"EMILY: Horrid music."
"RICHARD: Sells cowboy shirts and toy banjos."
"LUKE: I've known my guy for a while."
"RICHARD: You been to his office, checked out his operation?"
"LUKE: I just deal with him over the phone."
"RICHARD: Ah."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Hubert Lansing."
"RICHARD: Fell prey to a telephone scam running out of Estonia. Took his life with a track-and-field starter's p*stol."
"LORELAI: On your mark, get set, die awkwardly."
"RICHARD: It's not funny, Lorelai. The fact is, both of you have significant assets, and both of you are targets."
"LUKE: Targets?"
"LORELAI: How are we targets?"
"EMILY: You own your home."
"LORELAI: So every homeowner is a target?"
"EMILY: And an inn with a 26 Zagat rating."
"LORELAI: Okay, so that's two things."
"RICHARD: Two very valuable things."
"LUKE: The dragonfly is one of the highest-rated places in the area."
"EMILY: And Luke owns his diner and the building it's in and the building next door with the soda shop. That's another significant holding."
"LORELAI: Wait, did you put a P.I. On our tail or something? How do you know about Luke's real-estate holdings?"
"RICHARD: Because he told me all about them when we played golf last year."
"LORELAI: You did?"
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Who in the world would target us?"
"RICHARD; Grifters, con men. They know all the tricks."
"EMILY: Joe Collins."
"LORELAI: Oh, my god, the two of you have more stories than Somerset Maugham."
"EMILY: Well, your father has seen it all."
"RICHARD: And I must say, your daughter coming out of left field raised a red flag."
"LUKE: My daughter?"
"LORELAI: You think she's a Grifter?"
"RICHARD: Of course not."
"EMILY: But the people around her could be."
"RICHARD: It's just that the timing is a little suspicious."
"EMILY: Right when Luke's about to marry a woman of means."
"LORELAI: I'm not a woman of means!"
"RICHARD: Stars hollow real estate is skyrocketing. It's gone up 43% in the last 4 years."
"LUKE: It has. I heard that, too. 43%."
"LORELAI: That much?"
"EMILY: This daughter of yours, you saw substantiation?"
"LUKE: Well, there was a DNA test."
"RICHARD: That she performed herself, as I understand it."
"EMILY: Isn't that what you said?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, but…"
"LUKE: But her uncle helped her."
"RICHARD: And he's authorized to perform such a procedure?"
"LUKE: I think so."
"EMILY: You never confirmed it?"
"LUKE: I saw a picture of him, and he was standing right next to a microscope."
"RICHARD: Under the circumstances, I think it's best to take every possible precaution."
"EMILY: For our protection, as well."
"LORELAI: Your protection?"
"RICHARD: We're all connected now."
"EMILY: You're our daughter, and come June 3rd, Luke will be our son-in-law. They could come after your assets, then Luke's assets, then our assets."
"RICHARD: We could be wiped out."
"LORELAI: So this is about protecting you."
"RICHARD: It's about protecting all of us."
"EMILY: We're all in this together."
"RICHARD: All four of us."
"EMILY: Get dessert ready, Leticia. Who wants coffee?"
"RICHARD: Hmm."

"LUKE: I don't know if I can drive."
"LORELAI: Well, walk to the car."
"LUKE: Did you know real estate's gone up that much?"
"LORELAI: Not that much."
"LUKE: My shirt is soaking wet."
"LORELAI: I got to start reading the business section."
"LUKE: I never knew there were so many horrible ways you could lose everything you own."
"LORELAI: Or con men. Con men! Are there really con men?! I thought they went the way of"
"Vaudevillians and Trotskyites."
"LUKE: You've got to double, triple insure everything you own."
"LORELAI: I've got to learn more about umbrella policies."
"LUKE: Does Sookie know how much the inn has appreciated?"
"LORELAI: I don't think so."
"LUKE: Because if they can come after her, they can go after you 'cause you're her partner."
"LORELAI: Or, when we get married, they can come after you because we're married."
"LUKE: And Sookie's married to Jackson, so they could go after his farm and all of his equipment."
"LORELAI: Maybe I should sit down with Sookie."
"LUKE: And I'll talk to Jackson."
"LORELAI: Or maybe we could do it at the same time because that way, [Gets mad] no, this is ridiculous. This is what Gilmore's do. They get in your freaking head, and they mess with it."
"LUKE: Oh, they're good at that."
"LORELAI: Forget Sookie and Jackson. They're responsible people. Dad does the inn. We're covered there. I just need to talk to my homeowner-policy guy."
"LUKE: And I'll talk to my guy."
"LORELAI: But in person, right? You should see his office. That's what the Hubert Lansing story taught us."
"LUKE: Or was it John Kendall?"
"LORELAI: No, he's selling banjos in Nashville."
"LUKE: It was Hubert Lansing."
"LORELAI: So, in person."
"LUKE: Right. And I shouldn't worry about April."
"LORELAI: No."
"LUKE: Because if I was a guy hearing a story about what happened to me, the timing would sound suspicious."
"LORELAI: April's 12. She's not a con man. Though I know nothing about her mother."
"LUKE: Anna's cool."
"LORELAI: You know that for a fact?"
"LUKE: Absolutely. The timing was weird, but this woman is very down to earth, very un-materialistic. I trust my gut, and my gut says there's nothing bad there."
"LORELAI: Okay, good. I trust your gut, too. [Sighs] I feel like I should run in there and yell at them about something."
"LUKE: About what?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. That's what's stopping me."
"LUKE: What is this feeling, this tightness in the chest, this anger mixed with paralyzing weakness?"
"LORELAI: You've been Gilmored. But you know what the weird thing is? They referred to us as family, you, me."
"LUKE: Yeah, what was that about?"
"LORELAI: Well, I think in some twisted way, that may have been them actually validating us as a couple."
"LUKE: Wow, that is twisted and weird."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: [Sighs] Well, I think I can walk now. Can you walk?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: All right. Why did she say June 3rd?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it's old information. They're always a step behind."

"LORELAI: How come you have ""I've got the government's secret microchip in my briefcase, and they're on to me"" voice?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Do I? Sorry."
"LORELAI: What's wrong?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Nothing. I just finished having dinner with Rory."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. How did the tour go? Did she take you to stare at the old books? 'Cause that girl loves staring at the old books."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, we stared at the old books. The tour was great. I just...I have to tell you something."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"CHRISTOPHER: Now, I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to do this or not. Normally I wouldn't because it feels like a fink-out thing, but I think this falls under the parent thing, so that overrules the fink-out thing."
"LORELAI: Catch a wave, bud. You're drifting."
"CHRISTOPHER: Rory moved in with her boyfriend."
"LORELAI: What?!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Rory moved in with her boyfriend, and she said she was gonna tell you, but I thought, in case she didn't, then I should tell you, so I did, and I feel like a fink."
"LORELAI: You're not a fink. When did this happen?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Today. It was all very spur-of-the-moment. Hey, tell me about this guy. Do we hate him?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Logan, do we hate him, am I supposed to hate him?"
"LORELAI: No, you can feel however you want about him."
"CHRISTOPHER: Good, 'cause I think I like him. He's a cool guy. Great apartment. Funny."
"LORELAI: He's taken, Chris."
"CHRISTOPHER: I just wanted to make sure you didn't hate him before I committed to an opinion."
"LORELAI: You're entitled to your own take on him."
"CHRISTOPHER: What's yours?"
"LORELAI: Hey, for me, the jury's out on all you guys. You can thank Brad Pitt for that one."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so, anyhow, I told you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you told me. Wow. Our little girl is living with her boyfriend."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I had that moment, too. It was during the onion brick, so I had a little distraction, but I had it."
"LORELAI: Yeah. [Call waiting beeps] Um, hey, hold on. Hello?"
"RORY: Mom, it's me."
"LORELAI: Hey, you. Hold on a sec. [Changes line back] Chris, it's Rory."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, now, I did not tell you. Do not rat me out. When she tells you the news, you have to act surprised okay."
"LORELAI: Yes, I promise. It'll be like the time you told me you got Pat Benatar tickets for my birthday, but I knew because I went through your jeans looking for the clove cigarettes."
"CHRISTOPHER: You knew?"
"LORELAI: Bye, Chris. [Switches call back] Hey, kid, what's going on?"
"RORY: Not much. Having a bad reaction to an onion brick."
"LORELAI: What part of onion brick do you not understand?"
"RORY: I gave dad his tour today."
"LORELAI: Yeah!"
"RORY: It was nice. He saw the campus, we had dinner."
"LORELAI: Oh, how very ""7th heaven"" of you."
"RORY: Listen, I have some news, two pieces of news, actually. One is good, and one is, let's say, interesting."
"LORELAI: Oh, intrigue."
"RORY: Well, first, I was made the new editor of the Yale daily news."
"LORELAI: No, really? Rory, that's awesome."
"RORY: It is awesome."
"LORELAI: My god, I didn't even know you were up for the job."
"RORY: I wasn't, actually. It all kind of happened at the last minute."
"LORELAI: Hey, wasn't Paris the editor of the daily news?"
"RORY: Yes, she was, which brings me to my next piece of news."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"RORY: Paris was ousted, and when she found out that I had taken her place, she kind of kicked me out of the apartment."
"LORELAI: Well, sure."
"RORY: So I had no place to live, and there were absolutely no apartments for rent anywhere near campus, so...I moved in with Logan."
"LORELAI: Wow, big news!"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Well, jeez, tell me about his place. Is it nice?"
"RORY: Uh, yeah, it's really nice."
"LORELAI: Where is it?"
"RORY: The Taft building, right off campus, top floor."
"LORELAI: Top floor? Cool. Good view?"
"RORY: Great view."
"LORELAI: Awesome. How many rooms?"
"RORY: Dad told you, didn't he?"
"LORELAI: Oh, come on, I was doing so well."
"RORY: Please."
"LORELAI: How did you know?"
"RORY: Are you kidding me? ""How's the view? Is his place nice?"" You didn't call me Hester Prynne once."
"LORELAI: Don't be mad at him. He was just trying to do the dad thing. He hated it, by the way."
"RORY: I'm not mad."
"LORELAI: Good."
"RORY: [Sighs] So?"
"LORELAI: So, what?"
"RORY: So, what do you think of me moving in with Logan?"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, do you remember what happened the last time I piped in with my opinions on your life choices?"
"RORY: Mom, come on."
"LORELAI: You don't want to make sure the pool house is clean first?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: Okay, well, moving in, that's pretty big."
"RORY: I know."
"LORELAI: I mean, I don't know. I've never lived with a guy. There's that whole thing about the cow and the milk's free. I guess I would hate to think that you really moved in with him because there was a housing shortage, because it's a big step."
"RORY: I love him."
"LORELAI: Well, I want you to be happy."
"RORY: I am happy, really happy."
"LORELAI: Okay, then. Congratulations. Big day."
"RORY: Thanks."
"LORELAI: You're gonna have to tell me how it is living with a guy before I let Luke move in. If it's too creepy, he may have to stay with Babette. [Paul Anka jumps up on the couch]"
"RORY: I will."
"LORELAI: I've heard some horror stories about toilet seats you would not believe."
"RORY: Really? Do tell. Oh, but, wait, let me dim the lights and start the fire."
"LORELAI: You have a fireplace?"
"RORY: Wood-burning."

"SOOKIE: I'm experimenting for the prefix menu for Valentine's Day next week, trying to come up with something new, but there's nothing new under the sun. I mean who else would think to serve oysters on Valentine's Day? Hmm, I don't know, maybe 12,000 other establishments within spitting distance!"
"LORELAI: Well, lovers love oysters. I don't. I love burritos, people don't want burritos on Valentine's Day."
"SOOKIE: How do we know unless we give them the option, huh? That's it! I'll serve burritos!"
"LORELAI: Sookie, no."
"SOOKIE: No one else will have burritos."
"LORELAI: Sookie, you can't serve Valentine's Day burritos, that's flirting with disaster. We could be talking the octopus-ice-cream disaster of '98."
"SOOKIE: God, you're right. I'll figure it out. I'm just hitting an oyster wall here. Okay, take a break, guys. We'll resume in a bit."
"LORELAI: So um, what are you and Jackson doing for Valentine's Day, huh any plans?"
"SOOKIE: Well, after I finish up here, I'll go home, and Jackson, wonderful man that he is, will have made a lovely meal and opened up a bottle of Syrah and lit a candle. And then he and the kids and I will have a nice, romantic meal together. [Giggles] What about you?"
"LORELAI: Oh, I'll be here."
"SOOKIE: What? No, you'll be with Luke."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but we'll probably just hang out. We don't have a reservation anyplace for dinner. I'm sure everything's booked."
"SOOKIE: Uh, hello. I'm a chef. I know other chefs. I can get you into places."
"LORELAI: Maybe, Luke says Valentine's Day is just another one of those fake things, like mother's day, created by greeting-card companies, and it is."
"SOOKIE: Actually, it's not."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"SOOKIE: I'm printing a history Valentine's Day to go on the tables. It goes back like 2,000 years."

"LORELAI: Well, I'm not coming without Boozoo and the boys."
"RORY: The more the merrier."
"LORELAI: Cool! Bye, hon."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: [Hangs up the phone, Boozoo is still singing ""here comes the bride"" Lorelai stands up and moves towards the dinning room] Boozoo, I'm going to need my dining room back. Boozoo!"
"LORELAI'S (AND LUKE'S) HOUSE - LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai is following Luke down the stairs, he is carrying some travel bags, Lorelai is reading from a sheet of paper.]"
"LORELAI: Well there is all manner of outdoor activities to do in Martha's Vineyard, canoeing, snorkeling, sailing…"
"LUKE: That's mostly summer stuff. It's the dead of winter."
"LORELAI: Hiking and walking, that's doable."
"LUKE: Yeah, I guess. Is this all just for this weekend?"
"LORELAI: Plus these."
"LUKE: Isn't that way too much stuff?"
"LORELAI: It is the dead of winter. The question is do you have enough?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I brought enough. [Pointing to Lamp for Lorelai to turn on.] Burglar lamp."
"LORELAI: Ooh, and here, of course, is the big-time Martha's Vineyard thing, whaling."
"LUKE: They have whaling?"
"LORELAI: Not anymore. It's just a fun fact. [Continues reading sheet] Martha's vineyard was one of the world's largest whaling ports. Says here people used every part of the whale back then, the most important being spermaceti, used in candle production. Yuck, couldn't think up a less gross substance to use for candles?"
"LUKE: You know, it's a good thing I don't drive a compact."
"LORELAI: Herman Melville once shipped out of Martha's Vineyard. Here's a quote from ""Moby Dick."" ""Oars, oars, grip your oars, and clutch your souls now. My god, pull, men!"" Wait a second that isn't the pulling they had to do to get the spermaceti, is it?"
"LUKE: I don't think so. Let's go. We're already late."
"LORELAI: Coming. [As they make their way out side] Now what else, what else ""The first people on the island of Martha's Vineyard were Indians of the Wampanoag tribe. This tribe still makes up a large part of the town originally called gay head."" Hmm, figures, the Indians survive poverty, disease, then get stuck living in a place called ""gay head."""
"LUKE: I guess."
"LORELAI: You think there's any connection between gay head and spermaceti? [Laughs]"
"LUKE: [Staring to load his truck] I have no idea. Wait, it's an island?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, apparently."
"LUKE: That means there's a ferry."
"LORELAI: Oh, there is a ferry to gay head? That is just too easy. Let's see what else is interesting about the island we now know as Martha's Vineyard."
"LUKE: You don't have to do this."
"LORELAI: Do what?"
"LUKE: I'm fine with the weekend. You don't have to keep talking the place up."
"LORELAI: I just want you to have fun. You know I want you to relax."
"LUKE: I'll try, okay? I just have my concerns."
"LORELAI: What concerns?"
"LUKE: What concerns? Lorelai, where do we even stand with this guy?"
"LORELAI: What guy?"
"LUKE: Logan. Their relationship changes daily. I mean one day we like him, next day we hate him, next day we like him."
"LORELAI: Well, we have a sort of truce."
"LUKE: A truce, what does that mean, a truce?"
"LORELAI: It's a truce, everything's okay. None of us should invade each other or fire g*n across our borders or anything. We're in a truce."
"LUKE: But what if they break up while we're there?"
"LORELAI: They're not going to breakup."
"LUKE: Our bedroom isn't sharing a wall with theirs, is it?"
"LORELAI: I have no idea."
"LUKE: You don't know the layout of the house?"
"LORELAI: I thought spermaceti was a pasta until three minutes ago."
"LUKE: It's weird staying at people's houses, tiptoeing around, using their sheets, drinking their weird tap water."
"LORELAI: We'll stick to small beer. That's what they drank on the whaling boats. If it's good enough for the spermaceti boys... Come on, I don't want this to be work for you."
"LUKE: It's not work. Flipping burgers is work. This weekend's going to be fine."
"LORELAI: Maybe even fun?"
"LUKE: Yes, fun. Oh, hey, arr, I left April's bike in the garage."
"LORELAI: Oh, why?"
"LUKE: I was going to fix the wheel, and I forgot it was in the back. Is it okay I parked it there?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah. It should be safe."
"LUKE: All right, good. Let's go. We have a ferry to catch. Please, don't add anything to that."
"LORELAI: Party pooper… Ooh, there are a bunch of historical lighthouses. We should definitely see them. Huh. I wonder if there's a connection between the shape of lighthouses, ferries, spermaceti, and gay head. [Laughing]"
"INT HUNTZBERGER MATHA'S VINEYARD"
"[Rory opens the door]"
"[At the same time]"
"RORY: You made it!"
"LORELAI: We made it!"
"RORY: Hi, Luke!"
"LUKE: Sorry we're late."
"RORY: Your not late."
"LORELAI: It took longer than we thought, the ferry and all. Did you know Martha's Vineyard is an island?"
"RORY: Well I've been here before."
"LOGAN: Hey, there's our intrepid travelers."
"LORELAI: Hi, Logan."
"LOGAN: Welcome, and this must be Luke."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I dumped Luke. This is Clem. I picked him up at a truck stop on 95. We were at the register, paying for our blue plates, and our hands reached for the same Dixie Chicks cassette."
"LUKE: Luke Danes."
"LOGAN: Logan Huntzberger, good to have you, anything else to unload?"
"LUKE: Uh no, there's a few things, but I've got it."
"LOGAN: Great."
"RORY: So this is the place."
"LORELAI: Aww"
"RORY: [Walks in with Lorelai] This is the den, and the dining room, which seats 20, the wet bar."
"LORELAI: Just keeps getting better."
"RORY: And that's the living room, the kitchen's up there, and the ocean's out there, but you can't see it."
"LORELAI: Ahh, rip-off."
"LOGAN: So you guys hungry?"
"LUKE: We're fine. We ate on the road."
"RORY: Cool. Just a couple peculiarities about the house."
"LOGAN: It's a grandma, so it's got its kinks."
"RORY: Some of the hardwood floors have buckled, so watch your step."
"LOGAN: The French doors are warped from the winter, so you have to give them a yank when you open them."
"RORY: And that noise you may hear outside your window in the morning..."
"LOGAN: That would be stan."
"LORELAI: Gardener?"
"RORY: Raccoon."
"LOGAN: He's been living on the property longer than my family has. So we give him free reign."
"RORY: And the showers there are three of them. Run any two at the same time, and they turn to ice, so give everybody heads-up before you take a dive."
"LORELAI: Oh, good to know."
"RORY: Oh in the morning we'll have stuff here to eat, or you can go up the street to Joe's café for breakfast. They open at 8:00."
"LOGAN: 7:00, actually."
"RORY: Right, 7:00. We never go before 8:00. But that's all. Want to see your room?"
"LUKE AND LORELAI'S BED ROOM"
"[Door opens]"
"RORY: Here we are, we call it the king and queen's suite."
"LORELAI: Neat. Why?"
"RORY: Because you're our honored guests, and I just named it that"
"a second ago."
"LORELAI: We'll take it."
"RORY: So the controller for the heater is by the nightstand. All of the windows open, except for the second one on the left, so don't try to open it because you'll hurt your back. And don't forget about the showers."
"LORELAI: Got it."
"RORY: I guess we'll see you guys later."
"LORELAI: I'd really like to tip you, but I've only got a $20."
"RORY: Just add it to the bill, ma'am."
"LORELAI: Will do."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"LOGAN: Good to have you here. [Rory and Logan close the door a they leave]"
"LORELAI: So, nice digs, huh?"
"LUKE: Kind of dark to see."
"LORELAI: Well, I saw the weather forecast. They're predicting light in the morning."
"LUKE: So, how does this work?"
"LORELAI: How does what work?"
"LUKE: Are we supposed to stay in this room tonight?"
"LORELAI: Um, what's wrong with the room?"
"LUKE: Nothing, it's just that it's only 9:30."
"LORELAI: It's that early?"
"LUKE: What do you think they're gonna to do out there?"
"LORELAI: I don't know you think there going to do something?"
"LUKE: She's your daughter and your daughter's snotty boyfriend."
"LORELAI: Snotty? I thought he was very nice."
"LUKE: You call that nice? How he embarrassed Rory?"
"LORELAI: How did he embarrass her?"
"LUKE: Correcting her like that with the whole ""it's open at 7:00"" thing? She was humiliated."
"LORELAI: She wasn't humiliated."
"LUKE: Well, we just need them to hold on for three days."
"LORELAI: Hold on how?"
"LUKE: Hold on and not break up."
"LORELAI: They're not going to break up in the next three days."
"LUKE: Lot a tension here."
"LORELAI: Okay are we in the room for the night or you want to venture out?"
"LUKE: I don't know."
"LORELAI: Okay well I'll go see what's what, get the lay of the land here."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"HALLWAY LEADING TO THE LIVING ROOM"
"[Lorelai is tiptoeing down the hall to the living room, Rory is on the couch reading Joan Didion]"
"LORELAI: Psst!"
"RORY: Hey, you."
"LORELAI: [whispering] Are we supposed to stay in our rooms?"
"RORY: [also whispering] What? No. Why?"
"LORELAI: Just checking."
"RORY: You can stay in there or come out here."
"LORELAI: Okay, cool."
"RORY: Then why are you whispering?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. We're in somebody else's house."
"RORY: I know, it's a little weird, being a foursome."
"LORELAI: A little. We'll adjust."
"RORY: Yeah, we'll adjust... So, in or out?"
"LORELAI: I think we'll stay in."
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: All right."
"RORY: Good night."
"LORELAI: Night. [Giggles as she gets up to leave, Rory goes back to her book]"
"MORNING - LUKE AND LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"LORELAI: We've got ourselves a beautiful day."
"LUKE: Mm-hm."
"LORELAI: The ocean is so blue. I love the beach in the winter. The summer's too hot, too congested, you know?"
"LUKE: Yep, congested."
"LORELAI: What are you doing?"
"LUKE: Nothing."
"LORELAI: Are you eating?"
"LUKE: Just a Powerbar."
"LORELAI: Powerbar?"
"LUKE: You want one?"
"LORELAI: No. Luke, why are you eating?"
"LUKE: Well, I wasn't sure what the deal was."
"LORELAI: The deal as to what?"
"LUKE: I didn't know whether they served food or not"
"LORELAI: What else do you have in here?"
"LUKE: Just stuff."
"LORELAI: First-aid kit?"
"LUKE: In case we got hurt."
"LORELAI: Baggie full of batteries for..."
"LUKE: The flashlight, illuminates up to 50 yards."
"LORELAI: Bug spray, radio, granola bars...freeze-dried spaghetti?"
"LUKE: Just add hot water, eat it out of the bag."
"LORELAI: Am I going to find hot water in there?"
"LUKE: [Pulls some water from the bag] You got to heat it up on the stove."
"LORELAI: Oh...my god."
"LUKE: It's a bowie knife to cut fish, cut tree limbs..."
"LORELAI: Amputate a leg?"
"LUKE: Not a leg. It could do a foot."
"LORELAI: Luke, this is your backcountry bag. Why did you bring your backcountry bag?"
"LUKE: I didn't know what this weekend was."
"LORELAI: You didn't know we wouldn't be performing surgery on each other?"
"LUKE: I wanted to be prepared."
"LORELAI: I thought this bag was full of clothes."
"LUKE: My other bag's full of clothes."
"LORELAI: You're going to freeze."
"LUKE: It's plenty for me. I'm warm-blooded…"
"LORELAI: I know, I know you're warm-blooded. Check it and see. All right let's see what else they have to eat out there, okay? The freeze-dried spaghetti's not going to do it for me."
"LUKE: I didn't mean to bring the spaghetti."
"LORELAI: Come on and leave the knife."
"LUKE: Okay. [Puts the knife back in the bag]"
"KITCHEN"
"[Lorelai walks into the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Morning."
"LOGAN: Good morning."
"RORY: Hi, we've got coffee and pastries over there."
"LOGAN: The best pastries on the island."
"RORY: Yeah, you goto get them early or they run out."
"LOGAN: Even the prune is good."
"RORY: She will not like the prune."
"LOGAN: She'll like this prune."
"LORELAI: They look great."
"RORY: Where's Luke?"
"LOGAN: He is waiting for my signal."
"RORY: Your signal?"
"LUKE: To come out. He wants a signal it's okay."
"LOGAN: Got a flare g*n in the garage."
"RORY: Luke, it's okay! Come out."
"LUKE: Morning."
"LOGAN: Hi Luke."
"RORY: Luke, you know, you don't have to hide."
"LUKE: [To Rory] I wasn't hiding. [To Lorelai] Did you say I was hiding?"
"LORELAI: I did not say that."
"LOGAN: Help yourself to whatever."
"RORY: You've got to read faster."
"LOGAN: I read at my own pace, regardless of peer pressure."
"RORY: But my article is continued in the section you've been reading since before john wrote his gospel."
"LOGAN: I keep telling her we need to buy two papers."
"RORY: That's wasteful we don't need two papers."
"LOGAN: We need it for the health of the relationship. [Rory snatches the paper from Logan] There's your proof… We got eggs and stuff, too, Luke."
"LORELAI: You still hungry?"
"RORY: Still? You guys eat?"
"LUKE: No, we just ate a big dinner last night."
"LORELAI: Right… Hey, why don't we take a little walk first, huh? The beach is deserted. We'll have the whole thing to ourselves."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LOGAN: You might want a coat."
"LUKE: I'm fine."
"LOGAN: Cool."
"LORELAI: We won't be long."
"RORY: [Logan snatches the paper back] Drat."
"LOGAN: U snooze, you lose."
"BEACH."
"[Luke and Lorelai are walking along the sand]"
"LORELAI: Smell that air, sea."
"LUKE: Yeah, there's sewage somewhere, too."
"LORELAI: I'm loving this. It's been forever since I've been to the beach. Can you imagine living here?"
"LUKE: Wonder what real-estate prices are like."
"LORELAI: Probably pretty high."
"LUKE: Bet you the average joe can't afford it, that's for sure. Meaning if you work here, you can't live here, so you have to commute hours every day."
"LORELAI: Pretty place to work, though."
"LUKE: Waves keep you up last night?"
"LORELAI: No, I knew you were awake, though."
"LUKE: Sorry, it's just it's so loud…"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"LUKE: And just when I got back to sleep, Dan shows up."
"LORELAI: Who?"
"LUKE: The raccoon."
"LORELAI: Oh, Stan."
"LUKE: Yeah right. He decided to play a ""Sousa March"" with the trash-can lids. That's what a bowie knife's for."
"RORY: [OS] Hey!"
"[They walk over the Rory]"
"RORY: Nice out here, huh?"
"LORELAI: Beautiful."
"RORY: You look like you're freezing."
"LUKE: I'm fine."
"RORY: I forgot to give you these. [Tosses Lorelai some keys]"
"LORELAI: Oh, we finally earned your trust, huh?"
"RORY: We decided we'd risk it. We're heading out, we'll be back in a couple hours."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"RORY: The gym."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. Ocean's awfully loud down here. Where did you say you were going?"
"RORY: The gym."
"LORELAI: Sorry, the ocean is so loud…"
"RORY: Stop it. We like to hit the gym when we're here."
"LORELAI: I cannot picture this."
"RORY: Well stop mocking, because it's a good thing."
"LORELAI: I want to go just to see you at a gym. [Turning to Luke] You want to go?"
"LUKE: Sure, I'll go."
"RORY: Cool, let's go."
"LORELAI: Great, let's all go to the gym. That will never stop being funny."

"INT GYM"
"[Rory and Lorelai are getting a drink]"
"RORY: Hit me again, there, friend."
"LORELAI: Ah I needed that, especially after that jog we took."
"RORY: From the dressing room?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, it was at least 20 yards."
"RORY: Hmm."
"LORELAI: Plus the three steps we walked up to get in the building."
"RORY: That was some gnarly cardio."
"LORELAI: What is it about cucumber water that makes it so much more refreshing than non-cucumber water?"
"RORY: I think it's the cucumbers."
"LORELAI: Ha. So, shall we resume our workout?"
"RORY: Let's do it."
"LORELAI: You know, this is a nice facility."
"RORY: I know, I like that you can get day passes. You don't have to pay for a whole…"
"WORKOUT GUY: ahh!"
"LORELAI: That was loud."
"RORY: I think a little warning was order."
"LORELAI: No one remembers gym etiquette. Hey, any idea what part of the body this exercises?"
"RORY: I don't know. Do you lift it or pull it?"
"LORELAI: Or push it or climb it? So, the walk from the cucumber water to here, that was, what, another 20 calories?"
"RORY: Let's call it 40… Hey, is Luke okay? He seems a little distracted."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, he's fine. He's just not much of a traveler, so it's all kind of foreign to him."
"RORY: Coz I want him to have a good time."
"LORELAI: He will. [Lorelai notices the workout guy from earlier] Yeah?"
"WORKOUT GUY: Okay if I work in?"
"LORELAI: Okay work in what? Oh, you want to work in. Yeah, I guess I'm done. Boy, I'm going to be sore in the morning."
"RORY: Yeah, good reps there, mom."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"LORELAI AND RORY: [Watching the guy] Oh."
"LORELAI: You push with your arms."
"RORY: I was going to say that."
"LORELAI: Hum."
"RORY: More cucumber water?"
"LORELAI: I'm always up for more cucumber water. [More loud noises, the girls both jump] Ah! God, I'll never get used to that."
"BASKETBALL COURT"
"[Luke and Logan are playing a game]"
"LOGAN: It's probably your shoes."
"LUKE: Shoes are fine."
"LOGAN: Yeah but they're a size too small and they're low-tops."
"LUKE: I bought what they had. The shoes are fine."
"LOGAN: It's a drag you didn't bring your own gear."
"LUKE: Yeah drag, let's get going here, all right? I'm playing all out, so you play all out."
"LOGAN: You're overestimating my k*ll if you think I not playing all out. So it's what, 5-1?"
"LUKE: 6, you got 6, 6-1."
"LOGAN: Right, 6-1. [Logan scores another point] Sorry."
"LUKE: Don't apologize."
"LOGAN: That was a foul, too. I charged."
"LUKE: You barely touched me."
"LOGAN: I traveled."
"LUKE: No, you didn't foul me, and you didn't travel. Okay."
"LOGAN: Did you try loosening the laces?"
"LUKE: Just check the ball. 6-1?"
"LOGAN: 7, actually."
"LUKE: Right, right. 7."
"LOGAN: Sorry."
"LUKE: Don't apologize."
"INT GYM"
"[Luke and Logan are coming down the stairs and see Rory and Lorelai seated having a massage]"
"LOGAN: Hey, guys. What's going on?"
"LORELAI: Oh, wow. I was, like, in a Zen trance. I was totally somewhere else."
"RORY: Me too. I was in Greece. Where were you?"
"LORELAI: Bergdorf Goodman."
"RORY: When you reach a Zen trance, you go to Bergdorf Goodman?"
"LORELAI: To each his own. Thanks, Ron, Jerry."
"RORY: Yeah, thanks, guys."
"LOGAN: I didn't know the gym had masseurs."
"RORY: They don't."
"LORELAI: No, Ron and Jerry work for the laundry service, but they missed their calling."
"LUKE: You got laundry guys to give you a massage?"
"RORY: Never underestimate the persuasive powers of Lorelai Gilmore. So, you guys have fun throwing the old hoop around?"
"LOGAN: Or something to that effect."
"LORELAI: Look at you, you look like a billboard for the Martha's Vineyard chamber of commerce."
"LUKE: It's all they had."
"RORY: So, who won the game?"
"LUKE: These shoes stink."
"LORELAI: So you b*at the shoes."
"LOGAN: Nobody won. We just had fun. Do you girls need to clean up at all?"
"LORELAI: From...?"
"LOGAN: Right, well, I guess we'll see you out here."
"LUKE: We'll be about 10 minutes."
"RORY: Okay, see you in 10. So what do we do?"
"LORELAI: Ron, Jerry, you got 10 minutes? [Giggling, they sit back down] I love working out."
"LUKE AND LORELAI'S BEDROOM"
"LUKE: So what is this like, a fancy meal?"
"LORELAI: Ha, I don't think it's fancy. It's just a meal, they wanted to make us a meal."
"LUKE: But is it lunch or dinner? I mean it's at a weird time."
"LORELAI: Well I just think they just want us to eat in the daylight, you know, so we could enjoy the view."
"LUKE: It's getting kind of foggy out."
"LORELAI: It's still nice."
"LUKE: I had no idea it would be this cold."
"LORELAI: I told you like a million times."
"LUKE: But not this cold, and it doesn't help that the heat in this place doesn't work very well."
"LORELAI: Your full line of vineyard swag should keep you toasty."
"LUKE: This stuff is cheap as hell. The sweatpants I bought in the gym ripped already. Logan..."
"LORELAI: Logan? What about him?"
"LUKE: Well he's the reason they ripped, the way he was playing out there."
"LORELAI: How was he playing?"
"LUKE: I don't know. Annoying."
"LORELAI: What was he doing, specifically, to annoy you?"
"LUKE: What wasn't he doing? He was mocking me, traveling, fouling me without calling it, cheating on the score."
"LORELAI: And that spontaneously caused your pants to rip?"
"LUKE: You know what I mean."
"LORELAI: He seemed nice when you guys came back from the court. He said you were just playing for fun."
"LUKE: It wasn't fun, believe me."
"LORELAI: [Getting annoyed] Maybe you shouldn't have come with us to the gym. Nobody forced you to go."
"LUKE: [Caught off guard] I know."
"LORELAI: It's Valentine's weekend, you know? How about we stop talking about the gym and the stupid basketball game?"
"LUKE: Sure, okay, fine."
"LORELAI: Look, they're probably waiting for us. I'll just see you out there."
"LUKE: You got it."
"KITCHEN"
"LORELAI: I'm sorry, but this picture just does not compute."
"RORY: Stop."
"LORELAI: You're wielding a knife. That's verboten in Gilmore world."
"RORY: You forget that I'm a rebel."
"LORELAI: And you're wearing an apron."
"RORY: It's so my clothes don't get wrecked."
"LORELAI: You've not worn an apron since you saw ""the sound of music"" and you put one on so you'd look like sister Maria, and you made a big crucifix out of Popsicle sticks."
"[Rory gets something from a draw]"
"LORELAI: Wow."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: You just went to that drawer and got that thingamabob out of there like that's what you intended all along."
"RORY: It was."
"LORELAI: You know where things are."
"RORY: I've cooked here before."
"LORELAI: I may need to be resuscitated."
"RORY: Okay do you want to help or keep on the riff?"
"LORELAI: I wanna Help."
"RORY: Logan is taking care of the lobsters for us outside, and I am making a salad, mashed potatoes, and Bruschetta."
"LORELAI: [Picking something up] Hmm. What's this?"
"RORY: It's a Garlic press."
"LORELAI: [Picks up a large knife] This would do a foot."
"RORY: Step away from the knife."
"LORELAI: [Picks up something else] What's this?"
"RORY: That's a lemon Zester."
"LORELAI: Let me zest a lemon."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: I get to do something."
"RORY: Well, you can't just grab things. [Luke walks in] Hi, Luke."
"LUKE: Hey."
"RORY: Wash your hands, and I will give you a task."
"LORELAI: Exultant."
"LUKE: Food looks good."
"LORELAI: Rory's going to let me chop something."
"LUKE: Is that wise?"
"RORY: I did not say chop."
"LORELAI: All right I'm ready."
"RORY: Okay. [Handing Lorelai a small knife] Chop the celery."
"LORELAI: Yay! [Sees the knife] Oh, that's a dinner knife."
"RORY: [Handing her the big knife] Well, be very careful, please."
"LORELAI: I am Mario Batali and Ina Garten's love child."
"RORY: [Too Luke] Logan's outside dealing with the lobsters, if you want to join him, [Too Lorelai] he was very nice, by the way. He kept them well hidden from me when they were, let's say, not dead."
"LORELAI: Not dead? I don't like behind-the-scenes foodstuff."
"LUKE: I'll see what's going on out there."
"RORY: What did you mean, ""it would do a foot""?"
"OUTSIDE ON THE PATIO"
"[Logan is cooking]"
"LOGAN: Hey, they kick you out of the house?"
"LUKE: Kind of."
"LOGAN: You like lobster?"
"LUKE: I never had lobster."
"LOGAN: I think you'll like it if I don't screw it up. Making lobster is time-honored Huntzberger family tradition. It's in our blood."
"LUKE: Great."
"LOGAN: So FYI, I'm probably going to do the present thing at dinner."
"LUKE: [Slowly] The present thing."
"LOGAN: Just to give you a heads-up. Don't want to complicate your life."
"LUKE: You got Rory a present."
"LOGAN: For Valentine's Day. Forget?"
"LUKE: No."
"LOGAN: Okay"
"LUKE: I just didn't get her anything."
"LOGAN: Ah"
"LUKE: I mean, Valentine's Day isn't technically till Tuesday."
"LOGAN: Sure"
"LUKE: I have a couple of extra days."
"LOGAN: Right."
"LUKE: Is there anything open nearby?"
"LOGAN: Only if you want a windbreaker or some boating equipment."
"LUKE: Oh."
"LOGAN: Look, I went a little nuts and got two things for Rory. Let me give you one to give to Lorelai."
"LUKE: No, no, no, no."
"LOGAN: Yes, I got a necklace and a tennis bracelet. She doesn't need both. Take one, whichever one."
"LUKE: I can't do that."
"LOGAN: Dude it's Valentine's Day. You've got to give your girl a gift."
"LUKE: Well...maybe I will take one."
"LOGAN: Which one?"
"LUKE: How about the necklace?"
"LOGAN: Perfect."
"LUKE: Mainly because I have no idea what a tennis bracelet is."
"LOGAN: Let me finish up getting these things on. I'll take you in and show it to you. I left them in the car so Rory would not find them."
"LUKE: You really don't have to do this."
"LOGAN: I'm happy to. We men got to stick together."
"LUKE: Okay."
"KITCHEN"
"LORELAI: This is fun."
"RORY: You have got to stop doing that."
"LORELAI: I love the squishy feeling."
"RORY: You're going to over mash them."
"LORELAI: Is there such a thing as over mashing potatoes?"
"RORY: Yes, it's called potato soup."
"LORELAI: You know, you can put on the apron and shout out things like ""dice the carrots,"" but implying that you can over mash potatoes proves you're a phony."
"RORY: You're the one who thought the potato masher was a waffle shaper before I corrected you."
"LORELAI: Ha… Ow, I think I'm giving myself mashed-potato elbow. Would you like more chef's juice?"
"RORY: More wine would be great. So have I told you what we're thinking for the end of the school year?"
"LORELAI: What who was thinking?"
"RORY: Logan and I. Get this, Asia."
"LORELAI: Asia, wow."
"RORY: Well, some of Asia, China, Thailand, Vietnam. We're thinking six weeks."
"LORELAI: Sounds exciting, hon."
"RORY: We haven't finalized anything yet, but I bought the books, I'm doing the research."
"LORELAI: It's official. You've become too fabulous to hang out with me."
"LOGAN: How's it going in here?"
"RORY: It's good, I hope you like re-mashed potatoes."
"LORELAI: You can eat them with a straw."
"RORY: Where are you two headed?"
"LOGAN: I need the other tongs, they're buried in the garage and Luke was going to help me find them."
"LUKE: Right, we'll be right back."
"LOGAN: The clawed things out there, they went peacefully. [They kiss and Lorelai looks awkwardly away]"
"RORY: Thank you. [Logan and Luke leave] It's weird, you know?"
"LORELAI: What's weird?"
"RORY: I don't know, it just hit me. These could be the ones."
"LORELAI: The ones?"
"RORY: The ones, you know?"
"LORELAI: [Thinking] Yeah. Yeah."
"ON THE PATIO"
"RORY: Luke, weren't you a lobster neophyte? Looks like you liked it."
"LUKE: It's good. I can't believe I've never had it before. You cooked them perfect."
"LORELAI: Here, here. [Luke, Lorelai and Rory start clapping]"
"LOGAN: Thanks very much. You're too kind."
"LORELAI: Not that I'm hunting for my own compliment, but that celery I cut, huh?"
"RORY: Let's hear it for the celery chopper."
"LORELAI: Oh, this is so spontaneous and unexpected. Not quite loud enough. Thank you, thank you."
"RORY: So, should we clear?"
"LOGAN: Hey it's so pretty out here, sun will be down soon, so before it gets dark, happy Valentine's Day."
"RORY: Oh My God, you humanely k*ll lobsters and you got me a present? [Lorelai looking a little sad, then smiles]"
"LOGAN: I'm a multitasker."
"RORY: Mmm… Hah, It's a bracelet."
"LUKE: It's a tennis bracelet."
"LORELAI: You know what a tennis bracelet is?"
"LUKE: Well, my sister makes jewelry, so I've picked up some terms."
"RORY: Wow, I love it. Happy Valentine's Day."
"LOGAN: Back at you, ace. [They kiss]"
"LUKE: Well, I guess it's my turn. [Lorelai looking surprised] Happy Valentine's Day."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: Really."
"LORELAI: [Gasps] Oh, my god. Luke, it's beautiful."
"LUKE: Good, good. It's gonna to look great on you."
"LORELAI: Look at this."
"RORY: It's you. And it goes well with mine."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, they're almost matching."
"LOGAN: Luke and I actually sneaked out when you two were playing around in the kitchen. We found those in the same place."
"LUKE: Yep. Same shop."
"LORELAI: I can't believe you got me a Valentine's Day gift."
"RORY: Is it getting kind of cold?"
"LOGAN: Yeah, let's go in, we'll clear all this later. Let's just build a fire and get warm."
"RORY: Excellent."
"LUKE: You like it?"
"LORELAI: I love it."
"LUKE: Good."
"LUKE AND LORELAI'S BED ROOM"
"[Lorelai is sitting up in bed, looking at the necklace]"
"LUKE: [OS] I really cannot believe I've never had lobster before. It's my favorite thing out of the sea now. Kicks tuna's ass, kicks salmon's ass."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's good stuff."
"LUKE: [OS] Logan did a good job with it, too. We've got to find a good lobster place near stars hollow. [Comes out off the bathroom] Probably have to go to Litchfield. I'm not even going to attempt the lobster-house pancake world. Do you know a good lobster place? [Sees Lorelai with the necklace] What's wrong? I thought you liked it."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, I do. It's beautiful."
"LUKE: So what is it?"
"LORELAI: I don't know…. Lately, I've been feeling like it's just not going to happen."
"LUKE: That what's not going to happen?"
"LORELAI: Our wedding."
"LUKE: No, Lorelai, that's crazy. Of course it's going to happen."
"LORELAI: But do you really want it to?"
"LUKE: Yes. We're engaged. That hasn't changed. The wedding's just been postponed. That's all."
"LORELAI: It's not feeling like it's postponed."
"LUKE: What happened? I thought this would make you happy. It's making you sad."
"LORELAI: No, it's not, it's just... I had to cancel a lot of stuff this week, a lot of June 3rd stuff."
"LUKE: June 3rd? But I…"
"LORELAI: Well, I was holding out hope that maybe, if things calmed down with you a little bit, it would still happen. It was just stupid."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: I lost all our deposits."
"LUKE: That doesn't matter. We'll just put down new deposits."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"LUKE: We're getting married."
"LORELAI: I really want to believe that."
"LUKE: Look, I know I've been preoccupied. I don't like that about myself. It's just who I am. I get in my own head, and I forget about the people around me."
"LORELAI: I know, that's why I thought this trip would be good for you, get you thinking about something else, but it's been cold here and Logan's been bugging you and the raccoon is noisy and the waves were keeping you up. The trip was a dumb idea."
"LUKE: Lorelai, no. It was a good idea. [short pause] Hey..."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You know I love you, right?"
"LORELAI: I really need to hear that once in a while."
"LUKE: I love you, and I'm going to marry you, and at our wedding, we are having lobster."
"LORELAI: Okay. [They kiss. Lorelai looks at the necklace] I really love this necklace."
"LUKE AND LORELAI'S BED ROOM – NEXT MORNING"
"[Luke and Lorelai are just waking up]"
"LUKE: [Kisses Lorelai's shoulder] Morning. [Rubs her arm]"
"LORELAI: Good morning. How'd you sleep?"
"LUKE: I slept great, better than I have in months. How about you?"
"LORELAI: Wonderfully, actually. It's so quiet out there."
"LUKE: Just the waves."
"LORELAI: They didn't keep you up?"
"LUKE: No, I slept like a rock."
"LORELAI: I wonder if Rory and Logan hit the gym again. I'm going to go check. [Starts putting on a robe]"
"LUKE: I wouldn't put it past them."
"LORELAI: Or maybe they went hang gliding, went to climb a mountain, pearl diving, or skeet sh**ting. [Opens the door, Gasps] Wow!"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Breakfast Santa's been here."
"LUKE: Breakfast Santa? [Lorelai carries in the tray] Wow."
"LORELAI: The kids must have left it for us."
"LUKE: Well, I don't think there's really a breakfast Santa."
"LORELAI: So, how do we do this?"
"LUKE: Legs."
"LORELAI: Service here is so excellent."
"[Cut to a short while later Luke and Lorelai are sitting on the bed having finished breakfast]"
"LUKE: That must have been Harvey's beach. Last time I was at the beach, I was like 18."
"LORELAI: I was there, when I was a kid, I used to go with my friend Trish and her family. It had that snack stand where the cute boy worked. Remember? He looked like Emilio Estevez."
"LUKE: Well, I remember the snack stand, not Emilio."
"LORELAI: We used to do cartwheels to get his attention."
"LUKE: I remember my sister picking up someone's cigarette butt behind that stand and smoking it."
"LORELAI: Ew!.."
"LUKE: We could have been there at the same time on the same day. Isn't that weird?"
"LORELAI: Nah, we never were."
"LUKE: How do you know?"
"LORELAI: You would have distracted me from the snack-stand guy. And no guy ever did."
"LUKE: What about eloping?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: Eloping, we can do that, right? Instead of planning this whole big thing?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. Maybe. I guess we could. But Rory has to come. Is it still eloping if Rory comes?"
"LUKE: Sure, why not? Let's start planning it."
"LORELAI: You don't plan an elopement. You just do it."
"LUKE: Oh, right. That makes sense. We could even come back do it here when the weather's better. We could rent a place for a couple weeks in the summer."
"LORELAI: That sounds nice."
"[OS Door slams]"
"LORELAI: Whoa, loud."
"LUKE: Must be Rory and Logan."
"LORELAI: In some kind of hurry."
"LUKE: Hm."
"LORELAI: You guys, we're up here! In the interest of full disclosure, we're fairly casual."
"MITCHUM: [Mitchum comes into the room] Who are you?"
"LUKE: Who are you?"
"MITCHUM: Mitchum Huntzberger. Who are you?"
"LORELAI: Um, I'm Lorelai. I'm Rory's mother."
"MITCHUM: I'm looking for my son."
"[OS Door closes]"
"LOGAN: Dad! [Mitchum leaves the room]"
"[Luke and Lorelai get out of bed]"
"LIVING ROOM"
"MITCHUM: Where the hell have you been?"
"LOGAN: What are you doing here?"
"MITCHUM: You turn off your cell, your pager. I told you never turn off your pager."
"LOGAN: I got your pages."
"MITCHUM: So you're ignoring them? That's great."
"LOGAN: We're going to have it out in public?"
"[Rory is watching from another room]"
"MITCHUM: We're not in public, Logan. We're in my house. Yeah, we're going to have it out here."
"LOGAN: You didn't need me this weekend."
"MITCHUM: You don't get to decide whether you're needed or not. I decide that do you hear me?"
"LOGAN: They heard you in Nantucket."
"[Luke and Lorelai enter the room]"
"MITCHUM: You were not to be here. You were supposed to be on a red-eye to London last night. I was in a room full of colleagues!"
"[They start talking over one another]"
"LOGAN: How many time do I have to go to London, I've met all of them. I've met them all for God's sake!"
"MITCHUM: Some of them actually come from other bureaus to meet you, and you blow it off to be with your little girlfriend! You embarrassed me!"
"LOGAN: You want to talk time about embarrassment?"
"MITCHUM: You embarrassed me, you embarrassed yourself! You listen to me. You're getting on a plane to London. You're getting on a plane to London today."
"LOGAN: Dad!"
"MITCHUM: And you're going to explain to my colleagues why you wasted their Saturday and robbed them of their Sunday. And let me tell you this you better start acclimating yourself, because you're in London for at least a year starting the day after you graduate, as we discussed."
"LOGAN: You discussed it."
"MITCHUM: You're doing this, Logan, and I'm driving you to the airport myself right now. Get packed. You've got 10 minutes."
"LOGAN: I have guests."
"MITCHUM: Your guests can stay. [Mitchum walks out] You're leaving!"
"LOGAN: [Looks at Rory] Excuse me."
"[Lorelai looks at Rory]"
"INT HOUSE FRONT DOORS"
"[The doors are open and Logan is waiting]"
"LORELAI: I guess we can just pick something up on the way."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Hey. Still here?"
"LOGAN: Yeah, just waiting for Rory to get her things."
"LUKE: You ah, you need any help there?"
"LOGAN: No, thanks, Luke."
"LUKE: No problem. I just have to get that last bag."
"LORELAI: Hmm."
"LOGAN: I'm really, really sorry about this."
"LORELAI: Oh, hey, it's okay. It was fun while it lasted. [pause] No one understands letting family down better than I do."
"RORY: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi."
"RORY: Walk you out?"
"EXT – DRIVEWAY"
"[A car and driver is waiting]"
"RORY: Intimidating…. So, a full year in London."
"LOGAN: Yeah."
"RORY: So, when do you move, exactly? The Asia thing... I guess that's on the back burner?"
"LOGAN: [SIS ]"
"RORY: Do you have to leave the very day after you graduate or is there a cushion or…"
"LOGAN: Stop. It's not happening. Okay? Not yet. It's February. We don't have to think about this right now. Right now, it doesn't even exist, okay? I'm not going to think about it. Let's not think about it."
"RORY: Okay."
"LOGAN: Take the Porsche home and keep planning Asia."
"RORY: I've got all my books with me."
"LOGAN: Good. [Walks to the car, gets in and leaves.]"
"[Lorelai comes up]"
"LORELAI: So that's Mitchum, huh? It's just like I imagined him."
"[The car pulls away]"
"LUKE'S DINER - NIGHT"
"[Luke and Lorelai come in the front door]"
"LUKE: Hey, Caesar."
"CAESER: Luke, you're back early. How was it?"
"LUKE: Great."
"LORELAI: Ended dramatically, but, yeah."
"CAESER: Well, welcome back. There was something I was supposed to tell you."
"LUKE: Was it important?"
"CAESER: Must not have been."
"LUKE: Well, I'll take care of out here. Why don't you close out the back?"
"CAESER: Sure. Coffee's fresh. Maybe that was it."
"LUKE: Was that it?"
"CAESER: No. [Returns to kitchen]"
"LORELAI: Well, I'd love some coffee."
"LUKE: Coming up. Okay. What am I going to do with all that stuff?"
"LORELAI: Keep it. It looked good on you, especially the sweatpants. You got nice mass ass."
"LUKE: A what?"
"LORELAI: Massachusetts ass."
"LUKE: Well, maybe I'll keep those then."
"CAESER: I remember. Your daughter. I'm an idiot."
"What?"
"CAESER: That's what I had to tell you, April kept calling to confirm the time she's coming over tomorrow. [Lorelai looks sad]"
"LUKE: Oh she did."
"CAESER: Three o'clock, she kept calling to remind me like I wouldn't remember to tell you, which I almost didn't. She's pretty smart."
"LUKE: Yeah, thanks, Caesar. [pause, lost for words] Uh... so, three o'clock tomorrow. I guess her mother will pick her up around seven, so..."
"LORELAI: Right. So, I'll pop up sometime after that."
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI: Oh, and her bike, it's at my place."
"LUKE: Right, right, I guess I'll...pick it up tomorrow before three."
"LORELAI: Sure, anytime. You know, um, I'm just kind of tired. I don't need to wire myself up again. I think I'm just going to go home."
"LUKE: Oh, okay. I'll just tell Caesar I'm taking you."
"LORELAI: No, that's okay. That's okay. I think I'm going to walk."
"LUKE: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, stay here. I'll get my bags tomorrow or you can bring them when you come get April's bike."
"LUKE: Sure, whatever you want. It's cold out there, you know?"
"LORELAI: I know. Cold can be nice sometimes."
"LUKE: All right."
"LORELAI: See you tomorrow. [They kiss]"
"LUKE: Okay."
"LORELAI'S (AND LUKE'S) HOUSE"
"[Lorelai comes in and turns on the light, she has some mail with her, she checks her messages]"
"ANSWERING MACHINE: Lorelai, it's your aunt Alice. Jim and I saw the beautiful picture of you in the paper announcing your engagement. [Looks through the paper] How wonderful, and what a wonderful picture. I told Emily that you looked so young. We marked our calendar for June 3rd, [Gasps] and we look forward to it. And we're really looking forward to meeting this man of yours, as well. A restaurateur it says. Say hello to Rory for us, and we'll see you soon. Bye."
"[Answering machine beeps]"
"[Gasps as she find the announcement, the paper have 4 couples with Lorelai in the middle and a larger picture.]"
"SECOND MESSAGE FOR ANOTHER WOMAN: Hello this is Emelda Landers, I'm in the DAR with your mother and of course you went to school for a period with my daughter Carol. Well I told Carol I would pass her congratulations to you about the announcement. So that's it. Picture's beautiful. Goodbye."
"[Answering machine beeps]"
"THIRD MESSAGE: Hello, Lorelai, this is uncle James. Emily called to tell us to save the date, June 3rd. We saw the picture of you in the paper. It's very nice. [fade out]"

"[It's busy and Luke is serving customs there meals, Lane is doing something at the counter]"
"LUKE: Lane, we're getting backed up here."
"LANE: Done in a sec."
"[Lorelai comes in the front door]"
"LUKE: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: No bacon today. I had to fire my meat guy."
"LORELAI: How could you fire pepper pot? He's so cute, and his mother has that skin condition they can't diagnose."
"LUKE: He never brings what I order. I have 16 pounds of corned beef and no turkey."
"[Lorelai goes to the counter and sits, Luke continues to work]"
"LORELAI: He's so sweet, and his father has that foot-grafting operation coming up next month."
"LUKE: I can't keep a guy on because his parents are falling apart."
"LORELAI: I know, but he tells those funny little limericks, and his sisters were surgically separated two weeks ago. [Kirk is sitting next to Lorelai and start is sniff Lorelai] What are you doing, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Did you just eat a 3 musketeers?"
"LORELAI: No."
"KIRK: You really smell like nougat."
"LUKE: Stop sniffing my fiancée."
"KIRK: I can't help it my senses are more finely tuned these days."
"LORELAI: What is the scary man talking about?"
"LUKE: He's on a juice fast."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"KIRK: Wanted to clean out the pipes, refocus the arteries. I want to get the healthy glow of someone who consistently goes to the gym...without having to go to the gym of course."
"LORELAI: Of course. You look positively radiant."
"LUKE: You want eggs?"
"KIRK: [Slowly like he is hungry] Eggs..."
"LORELAI: Err, scrambled and a couple pancakes, please."
"KIRK: [Quietly to Lorelai] Blueberry pancakes, blueberry pancakes."
"LORELAI: Kirk, eat something."
"KIRK: What? Oh, no, I'm doing fine."
"LORELAI: Yeah, okay. [To Luke] Hold on there, speed racer."
"LUKE: I have to get these orders [To Lane] since I'm the only one serving here."
"LANE: Almost done, Luke."
"LORELAI: I just want to remind you about Rory's panel…"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: Ah the panel I'm going to today, the young voices of journalism panel."
"LUKE: Rory's thing?"
"LORELAI: Well, it looks like Christopher is going to be there, also, and I just thought you should know."
"LUKE: He's been showing up a lot lately."
"LORELAI: He's trying to make good… for Rory, so..."
"LUKE: I'm good. I'll get you those pancakes."
"KIRK: Blueberry pancakes. Blueberry pancakes!"
"LANE: Okay, what do you think?"
"LORELAI: [Gasps] Oh, nice. Very ""white rabbit."""
"LANE: Well, I want it to stand out."
"LORELAI: It does. It's great."
"LANE: What do you think of the picture?"
"LORELAI: The picture's great. What's wrong with the picture?"
"LANE: I photograph so Asian."
"LORELAI: Yeah, well, I think Ming-Na has that same problem."
"LANE: I have to get back in a band. I'm going crazy not playing."
"LORELAI: I can imagine."
"LANE: You go from having band practice every day and seeing [Choking up a little] certain people every day, and then suddenly you're not."
"LORELAI: You mean Zach?"
"LANE: And Brian and Gil."
"LORELAI: Yeah. You guys still aren't talking? [Lane shakes her head] Well, the flyer is great."
"LANE: Thanks."
"LORELAI: I like the shiny, fancy pens you used."
"LANE: They're Luke's daughters, actually. She left them here last week, and I snagged them."
"LORELAI: Good score. [Chuckles] So she's been coming around a lot lately, huh?"
"LANE: Yeah, she comes in here and studies or draws. We even play some games when things get slow. She kicks my ass at scrabble."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah?"
"LANE: When we play Monopoly, I rule, because she's a kid and hasn't gotten the monopoly concept. She still thinks park place is a good buy."
"LORELAI: Sweet."
"LANE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Huh…I used to play board games with Rory a lot. She'd get very upset when I'd cheat. Huh, so cute."
"LANE: It's hard to cheat with April. She spends the first 20 minutes reading the rules manual right in front of you."
"LORELAI: Rory was obsessed with battleship. I always thought she was gonna join the navy when she grew up."
"LANE: Well, there's still time."
"LORELAI: Yes, fingers crossed."
"LUKE: [Walking up to them] Hey, Lane, how about a raise?"
"LANE: Sorry, Luke. [To Lorelai] I got to go."

"JONI: You hate it."
"RORY: Joni I don't, and I promise I'm gonna run it. I just need you to cut about 400 words. Don't give me that look. Simplify your prose. You'll still get your point across, and I won't have to publish a newspaper the size of a David Foster Wallace novel. [Comes to Paris's desk] Paris?"
"PARIS: Yes?"
"RORY: I wanted to give you some notes on your campus safety piece."
"PARIS: Fine."
"RORY: Um, well, I think it's good. It's really good, actually, um, but the lead's a little flabby. Getting into an example might give it more punch up top."
"PARIS: If you say so. Anything else?"
"RORY: Uh, some of the quotes read too long. I'd cut two or three and trim, Paris, what are you doing?"
"PARIS: I don't know. What am I doing?"
"RORY: You're not making eye contact with me."
"PARIS: I'm looking right at you."
"RORY: No, you're not."
"PARIS: Want to test me? Brown hair, blue eyes."
"RORY: Here's your hard copy. I think those notes will help."
"PARIS: Of course you do. They're your notes."
"RORY: Not because they're my notes, because they're good notes."
"PARIS: Says the note giver. It'll take half an hour."
"RORY: Fine. [walks away from Paris] That was unpleasant."
"DOYLE: Try sleeping with her."
"RORY: I'll take your word for it."
"DOYLE: No, it's impossible because she doesn't sleep anymore. She makes damn sure I don't, either. Last night she decided it would be fun to watch ""Saw II"" at 3:00 in the morning. Then when I woke up and asked her if she could turn it down, she berated me for being a film snob."
"RORY: How are you handling it?"
"DOYLE: I believe the term for it is ""keeping my mouth shut."""
"RORY: I don't know what to do with her. She's one of the best reporters we have, but she has gone way beyond her normal level of nuts."
"DOYLE: She's on the warpath right now. She'll calm down. She just needs some time."
"RORY: You know, maybe I could give her more to do. That piece she just wrote would make a great series. Giving her something like that might help her rebound faster, make her the normal Paris again. What do you think."
"DOYLE: Um, sure."
"RORY: That wasn't very convincing."
"DOYLE: It's your call."
"RORY: Doyle come on former editor to current editor. What do you think?"
"DOYLE: [Sighs] Would you do that for any other staffer who was treating you the way she is?"
"RORY: No."
"DOYLE: Look I have more interest in Paris snapping out of this than anyone. I think it's something she's gonna get to on her own."
"RORY: Yeah… Yeah, you're probably right."
"DOYLE: I got to go. I'm gonna sneak back to the apartment, see if I can get a few hours of sleep before Paris comes home and spends the rest of the night wanting to play the jazz trumpet. Yeah, she bought a trumpet."

"ZACH: [Singing] Click-clack, open up the door, girls click-clack, open up the door, boys front door, back door, clickety-clack. [He notices Land leaving. Music stops] Joel, take it."

"But as of today, josh is simply the guy who holds my sister's purse when she goes shopping, and because of that, I have to spend the next six hours practicing to walk in a straight line."
"RORY: You have yet to accomplish that, so practice wouldn't hurt."
"LOGAN: [Sighs] I'm not there, and I'm bored already."
"RORY: You can always talk to your good friend ""flasky""."
"LOGAN: Right. Thanks for the reminder. I just don't understand wedding rehearsals. The bachelor party, I get."
"RORY: I bet you do."
"LOGAN: The actual ceremony, I get. But the rehearsal, I don't get."
"RORY: Wallet."
"LOGAN: And after we finish rehearsing, I have to sit through a 5-course dinner surrounded by my new family and honor's brigade of moronic bridesmaids."
"RORY: Oh, come on, you love honor. Her friends can't be that bad."
"LOGAN: Oh, no. Blondie, dipsy, bubbles, four nose jobs, charm McGee, all great gals."
"RORY: Meow."
"LOGAN: Can't you just do the panel, blow off the mixer, and meet me for the dinner?"
"RORY: Logan, come on. By the time I get out of there and get back here to change, drive all the way to New York, dinner would be over."
"LOGAN: No, it wouldn't. Dinner's never gonna be over. It's gonna last forever."
"RORY: I will be here waiting for you when you get back, and I will have aspirin."
"LOGAN: Fine. I'll be back by 11:00 ten to 11:00, possibly 10:30."
"RORY: Go."
"LOGAN: Fine."
"RORY: Did you forget something? [They share a long kiss]"
"LOGAN: You look incredible. Knock 'em dead. [They kiss again]"
"[Door closes, Rory goes to the remote and turns the volume up.]"
"AUDIENCE FOR THE EDITORS PANEL"
"[Lorelai walks in]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey. [He kisses her on the cheek]"
"LORELAI: Nice seats."
"CHRISTOPHER: I got here early and scouted out the best ones. [They sit down] We were more towards the middle, but then two people, I'm pretty sure it was Brigitte Nielsen and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, sat right in front of me."
"LORELAI: Brigitte and Kareem showed up, huh?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I swear, any place with free cheese and crackers, they are there."
"CHRISTOPHER: You look nice."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"CHRISTOPHER: I think this haircut cost more than all the haircuts I've had in my life combined."
"LORELAI: Hmm. Well, it was worth it. It looks very, very short."
"RORY: Mom, dad."
"LORELAI: The woman of the hour."
"RORY: You made it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Of course we did."
"RORY: [Lorelai and Rory huge] Careful! The hair, it's pinned perfectly."
"CHRISTOPHER: Whoa."
"LORELAI: Yeah. Sorry… So, are you excited?"
"RORY: Yeah, and nervous. I've got a lot of talking points. I feel like I'm gonna get up there and forget everything."
"CHRISTOPHER: You're gonna do great, hon."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you are. You're a natural at this kind of thing. And just remember if things don't go well, we will stop loving you."
"RORY: I better get up there. I'll see you guys afterwards."
"LORELAI: Yeah. We'll be rooting for you."
"RORY: It's not really a root-for-me kinda thing, but thank you."
"LORELAI: Well, we brought foam fingers."
"CHRISTOPHER: We're doing the wave if things get dull."
"LORELAI: Yeah. [They take there seats, Lorelai offers a Dud to Chris] Dud?"
"GORDON: Welcome, everybody, to the young voices of journalism panel. I'm Arthur Gordon, a professor of English here at Yale, and I shall be moderating today's panel. We're joined today by the editors of the country's most prestigious collegiate newspapers."
"CHRISTOPHER: [To Lorelai] Whoo-hoo! [Lorelai taps Chris on the arm]"
"GORDON: We have before us editors from the Harvard Crimson, the Daily Princetonian, the Cornell Daily Sun, the Daily Pennsylvanian, and the Yale Daily News all here today to tell us what's on their minds, to hear where they think ivy-league journalism is heading, and more broadly, to share their views on the future of the free press in America."
"LORELAI: [To Chris] Whoa. Heavy."
"GORDON: I will begin by posing a series of questions to our panel. Now let's begin. I was wondering how the panelists would describe the state of journalistic ethics on a collegiate level in the post-Judy Miller era, and…"
"QUENTIN: Wonderful question. Quentin Walsh, Daily Princetonian. The ramifications of the scandal to which you obliquely alluded ought not to be underestimated."
"CHRISTOPHER: [To Lorelai] I hate this guy already."
"LORELAI: Rory told me about him. That's ""pompous Princeton guy."""
"CHRISTOPHER: Well if your parents name you that, what chance do you have? [Lorelai giggles]"
"QUENTIN: The struggle to preserve the fundamental principles and rights upon which our free press depends was made far more difficult by the choice of certain reporters who shall remain unnamed [Laughs] To capitulate to governmental pressure and divulge their sources."
"LORELAI: He's unbelievable."
"CHRISTOPHER: He's wearing a bow tie."
"LORELAI: Should I dud him?"
"QUENTIN: I myself have, on occasion, felt tremendous pressure to divulge unnamed sources, but I've stood my ground, knowing that while I may suffer for my principled stand, there was a much greater issue at stake."
"RORY: If I may? Rory Gilmore, Yale Daily News. While I agree there is no greater or more important tool for a free press than confidential sources, I also think it unwise for us to presume from our limited experiences editing college newspapers that we really have any true understanding of what it must feel like when the Federal Government of the United States puts the screws to you. I just think it would be the height of hubris for us to claim that we know what we would do when faced with that kind of pressure. But that's just one reporter's opinion."
"LORELAI: We created her."
"CHRISTOPHER: Out of thin air."
"[Later at the Panel discussion.]"
"RORY: I just don't care how funny the picture is. If it's not newsworthy and I can't see how it would be, I would not publish a picture of the university president stuffing his face with key lime pie at the drama club bake sale."
"GORDON: I'm sure president Levin will be pleased to hear that."
"[Laughter from the audience.]"
"RORY: If someone pushed key lime pie in the president's face as a statement, that I would print."
"QUENTIN: Me, too, front page."
"RORY: Quentin, you agreed with me. I didn't think you were capable."
"[Laughter from the audience.]"
"GORDON: On that note calendula, we have to end our discussion. I'd like to thank all our panelists for a terrific discussion and thank you all for coming."
"LORELAI: Our girl's got k*ll."
"CHRISTOPHER: She even had her archrival laughing with her by the end."
"LORELAI: She's keeping her enemies close and giggling."
"CHRISTOPHER: Very devious."
"RORY: So?"
"LORELAI: If I had a cooler of Gatorade, I'd pour it over your head."
"RORY: Sounds refreshing. So, I was pretty good, wasn't I?"
"LORELAI: You dazzled."
"CHRISTOPHER: You totally wiped the floor with ""pompous Princeton guy""."
"RORY: Well, the floor looked a little dirty."
"LORELAI: So, can we take you out for an ice-cream soda?"
"RORY: Sorry. I gotta go we have this editors' mixer thing now. Rain check?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, go. Mix well."
"CHRISTOPHER: Bye, hon."
"RORY: Bye."
"LORELAI: We were just rain-checked."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yep."
"LORELAI: I don't know how I feel about that."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, so I kept track, wrote 'em down. I got 16 words that she used that I have never heard before."
"LORELAI: Perspicacious?"
"CHRISTOPHER: 17 words that I have never heard before. My god, she's smart."
"LORELAI: She is smart. She's Anthony Michael hall in ""breakfast club"" smart."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm very proud and mystified. [Pager beeps]"
"LORELAI: Well, me, baby, all me."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, it's my new nanny."
"LORELAI: Oh, does sienna know about this?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Actually, this is the fourth new nanny in six months. I'm telling you, pickings are slim out there for someone decent to look after your kid."
"LORELAI: I think that's why they invented parents."
"CHRISTOPHER: Ah, crap, she can't work Sunday."
"LORELAI: What's going on Sunday?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I promised my mother I'd take her to the cemetery to visit my dad's grave. I'm thinking it might not be the thrill for G.G. That it's gonna be for the rest of us."
"LORELAI: Not without noisemakers, it won't."
"CHRISTOPHER: This s single parent stuff."
"LORELAI: Fun, huh?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I tell you, I can't wait till G.G. Starts school."
"LORELAI: G.G.'s starting school? You're so old. Where is she gonna go?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Not sure yet. These snotty private schools are impossible. There are waiting lists and psychological tests and blood samples and sworn oaths and dark back-room promises, and every single headmistress looks like Dick Cheney."
"LORELAI: You can always send her to public school."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, I could, if I wanted to k*ll my mother."
"LORELAI: Well, you will be at the cemetery tomorrow."
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor."
"LORELAI: [Chuckles] You know um, If you're ever stuck and you need somebody to watch her, I'd be happy to fill in."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'm fun. I like Teletubbies."
"CHRISTOPHER: Sober?"
"LORELAI: [Scoffs] I have got plenty of Rory's old books and games, and I'm totally at your service."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, well, I just may take you up on that."
"LORELAI: Good."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, what does ""perspicacious"" mean?"
"LORELAI: I don't know. ""Persp"", to perspire? Am I close?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Close enough for me."
"BAT MITZVAH"
"[Band plays introduction to ""Hollaback Girl"", Zach walks in and listens as they play.]"
"GIL: [Singing] So, that's right, dude meet me at the bleachers no principals, no student teachers both of us want to be the winner but there can only be one so, I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you that's right, I'm the last one standing another one bites the dust a few times I've been around that track so it's not just gonna happen like that"
"I ain't no hollaback girl"
"I ain't no hollaback girl"
"A few times I've been around that track so it's not just gonna happen like that 'cause I ain't no hollaback girl"
"I ain't no hollaback girl"
"ooh, ooh, that's my shh that's my shh"
"ooh, ooh, that's my shh that's my shh"
"ooh, ooh, that's my shh that's my shh"
"ooh, ooh, that's my shh that's my shh"
"ooh, ooh"
"[Cheers and applause]"
"GIL: Thank you, everyone. That's our Bat Mitzvah girl Julia Lowman's favorite song in the world, and I can see why, because it's full of strong female attitude, which I dig. Let me tell you, Julia, guys are turned on by that. Don't think they aren't. They like girls with legs and brains, like smart biker chicks, you know? So keep on the path you're on, keep up with school, and, baby, you're going places. [Applause] I see the cake coming out of the kitchen, everybody, so we're gonna break for a couple minutes to sugar up. Back in a few."
"ZACH: Hey, guys."
"BRIAN: [To Gil] I think you used too much whammy bar during ""my humps."""
"GIL: I was out of control."
"ZACH: So, you guys aren't gonna talk to me?"
"BRIAN: What's there to talk about?"
"GIL: Yeah, man. You're way deep in my bogus bag, and it's zip locked shut."
"ZACH: Well, you guys sounded great."
"GIL: Yeah, I get what you're saying. It's a West Hartford Bat Mitzvah, not the Albert Hall. Well, a gig's a gig."
"ZACH: Totally. A gig's a gig. This crowd is lucky. I'm telling you, it was tight. You could've played that at the Albert Hall… [To Brian] So, uh, I reached a new level on Soulcalibur 3."
"BRIAN: Uh-huh."
"ZACH: Level 50 assassin."
"BRIAN: Really?"
"ZACH: Yeah I just low-kicked my way through and chalked up a mess of perfects."
"BRIAN: You're gonna take the sword master mantel soon."
"ZACH: But you're, like, the original sword master."
"BRIAN: I b*at the last boss. Hit him middle, high, middle, low, middle, high. Took forever to figure out all his specials."
"ZACH: I know. I was sitting next to you when you did it. It was awesome… Listen, this thing with us, I want to fix it."
"GIL: It's too late."
"ZACH: It's not. Look, I know I was an idiot. If I could turn back time, I would."
"BRIAN: Oh, hey, ""turn back time."" We should add that to the set. Cher is always a slam dunk."
"ZACH: I want to get the band back together. We were going somewhere, you know? About to play for a label, and, well, I miss you guys. I don't mean to get all ""Brokeback Mountain"" on you, but we're buds, you know, and I miss you, and you're not gonna believe it, but that kid over there is about to down a whole cup of maraschino cherries."
"GIL: That's Aton, the Feldman's boy."
"BRIAN: He's gonna do it, man. He's gonna do it."
"KIDS: [Chanting] Go, go, go! Yay!"
"GIL: He did it!"
"ZACH: I didn't think he had it in him."
"BRIAN: He is gonna be puking."
"ZACH: So, what do you say, guys? You want to re-form Hep Alien?"
"GIL: Maybe, if you can get lane."
"BRIAN: She'll never come back."
"ZACH: Leave lane to me. I'm gonna reason with her."
"BRIAN: Well, if lane's in, I'm in."
"GIL: Me, too. Hep Alien has got to rock again."
"ZACH: Cool. [The 3 of them shake hands together]"
"MAN: Excuse me, Gilbert. [Talks in Gil's ear]"
"GIL: Oh it's time for the big one."
"BRIAN: Let's do it."
"ZACH: Kick ass, guys."
"GIL: All right. Let's bring this whole mishpachah down to the dance floor, 'cause it's time to rock-a-dila!"
"Hava naGila, hava naGila, hava naGila, venis'mecha, hava naGila, hava naGila, hava naGila, venis'mecha"
"[Zach, dances in the crowd]"
"HONOR'S WEDDING"
"[Logan and Rory enter]"
"RORY: This place is like a labyrinth."
"LOGAN: Well if you get lost, keep your hand on the wall and keep walking. You'll find your way out or get eaten by a Minotaur."
"RORY: Thanks, chum."
"LOGAN: Josh, my man, what's going on?"
"JOSHONOR: My cuff links have been stolen."
"LOGAN: Don't worry. I'm good at finding things. At Easter-egg hunts, they used to make me wear an eye patch to keep things fair."
"JOSHONOR: Okay, but I suspect thievery."
"LOGAN: You sure you'll be okay hanging out by yourself for a while?"
"RORY: For at least a fortnight. I'm good. Go, put on your eye patch, and find some cuff links. [They Kiss]"
"LOGAN: I'll see you later. Come on, josh. Dead man walking!"
"RORY: Excuse me. I'm trying to find the library."
"MAN: Oh, sure, it's in the east wing."
"HONOR: Rory!"
"RORY: Oh, hey, bride. You look beautiful."
"HONOR: You like my wedding sweats? [They giggle] I'm beginning think town & country might not approve."
"RORY: How are you doing?"
"HONOR: Okay. You have to come back and hang out with me and the bridesmaids."
"RORY: Oh, that's sweet, but I can't. I have all this work."
"SOFIA: Ladies, come on. Makeup time. And whoever took Josh's cuff links, hand them over."
"HONOR: Look, the girls have cracked open a case of champagne. I need you to be my designated dresser. I'm the bride, you can't say no to a bride. It's bad luck."
"RORY: I guess I can do my work tomorrow."
"HONOR: That's always been my motto. Come on. All day, if anyone does something I don't want them to, I'm saying it's bad luck. I swear, getting married is so fabulous!"
"[They go into the dressing room]"
"HONOR: Everybody, so, this is my lovely friend Rory. Rory is gonna hang out with us while we get ready. Some of you might have met at the shower, but this is Alexandra, Walker, Megan, and Claude."
"[They all say Hi.]"
"WALKER: Welcome to the final hours of honor's maidenhood."
"ALEXANDRA: Yeah right, Honor's maidenhood didn't make it to upper school at Brearley."
"HONOR: Not true. Turks and Caicos -- 1996."
"MEGAN: Anyway, we're here to celebrate these last precious hours before we lose Honor to the dark side."
"WALKER: And to celebrate, we drink booze."
"[Together, Whoo!]"
"HONOR: Not me. I'm having one glass right before the ceremony."
"ALEXANDRA: Whatever you need to tell yourself."
"CLAUDE: Ooh, I love that dress, Rory."
"RORY: Oh, thanks."
"MEGAN: Is that Carolina's?"
"RORY: Um, no, it's mine."
"HONOR: Oh, Rory, this is Italo. Italo's a total genius. If they gave Macarthur grants for hair, he'd get one."
"WOMAN: Okay, girls, I need to get you in these chairs pronto."
"WALKER: Bridezilla?"
"HONOR: [Laughs] Okay, but just one now and one right before the ceremony."
"ALEXANDRA: Whatever you need to tell yourself."
"HONOR: I need it to make a toast. [Clears throat] To friends, old and new, borrowed and blue. You guys are awesome."
"[Together, Yay!]"
"WALKER: To honor and to honor's honor. The missing maidenhood. [Cheering and laughing]"

"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Doorbell rings]"
"LORELAI: Hi."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey."
"LORELAI: What's all this?"
"CHRISTOPHER: G.G.'S pillow. Here's her blanket and duvet cover."
"LORELAI: Err, what no mattress and box spring?"
"CHRISTOPHER: She never goes anywhere without her duvet cover. She calls it her scrunchy-bunchy because she likes to scrunch it..."
"LORELAI: and bunch it. Hey I get it. Um, did you forget the kid?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, uh, G.G. come on, honey."
"LORELAI: What's she chasing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, that's a cat."
"LORELAI: Err, just so you know, that cat bites, scratches, and sprays, and I'm pretty sure it's in heat."
"CHRISTOPHER: G.G.? Come on, sweetie. Right now. [G.G. Comes to the door]"
"LORELAI: Hey, kiddo. I'm so excited to hang out with you today."
"CHRISTOPHER: G.G., You want to give Lorelai a hug?"
"G.G.: [Yelling] No! [She drops her jacket, takes the scrunchy-bunchy and runs into the living room]"
"CHRISTOPHER: G.G., Please come back here and pick up your jacket. G.G.?"
"LORELAI: I'll get it for you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thanks again for doing this. I really appreciate it."
"LORELAI: Please. I'm looking forward to it. I managed to find UNO and checkers and parts of battleship and most of the pieces of candy land, which I figure we can mix together to create a fabulous new game, candy ship battle land. w*r never tasted so good."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, then. Well, I'm off. [Chris kisses Lorelai on the cheek]"
"LORELAI: Go. Get out of here. [Chuckles, closes the door and goes to find G.G. , Gasps] You already figured how to turn on the TV on? You smarty. [Sits on the couch next to her] So, what are we watching?"
"G.G.: Shh! [Which makes Lorelai back off]"
"LORELAI: ""Shhhhh-indler's list""? [Chuckles] Oh, ""Full House."" You know, I think the Olsen twins weigh less now than they did on that show. [G.G. looks at Lorelai] Right. I get it. I don't like it when people talk to me when I'm watching TV either."
"HONOR'S WEDDING – DRESSING ROOM"
"[The bridesmaids are dressed and standing around, drinking]"
"HONOR: Okay, so I don't look obese?"
"MEGAN: You look like a skeleton."
"WALKER: A beautiful, blushing skeleton."
"HONOR: Whoa."
"RORY: What?"
"HONOR: All of a sudden the idea of marriage seems totally archaic and insane. Legally binding one woman with one man until they die? It's perverse. Why on earth do people do this?! Why am I doing this?!"
"WALKER: Uh-oh. Freak-out."
"CLAUDE: You love Josh, remember?"
"HONOR: Oh, yeah, josh. Okay. Okay, freak-out over. [Laughs] I wonder if josh is freaking out."
"MEGAN: We saw him before we took a smoke break. He looked nervous."
"HONOR: Oh, adorable. Hey, can someone check my sling-back? It feels messed up, and I can't reach my own feet."
"WALKER: Certainly. [Gets down on the floor, half drunk] Oh, yes, the sling-back is not slung back properly. I think I can remedy this if I just sling this back. [She knock the bottle of Champaign over she is holding and everyone gasps] Oops!"
"HONOR: Did that get on my dress? Someone tell me if I need to freak out."
"MEGAN: It's fine."
"[They all laugh]"
"HONOR: Get away from me, you lousy drunk."
"WALKER: Hey, that's offensive. I'm a terrific drunk."
"HONOR: I need my designated dresser."
"RORY: At your service."
"HONOR: Make sure it's secure because I plan on dancing tonight."
"CLAUDE: Speaking of dancing, has anyone warned Rory about the quote-unquote dignitaries coming to the shindig? It's always the same culprits."
"RORY: I need warning?"
"ALEXANDRA: The ambassador from Luxembourg is very handsy."
"MEGAN: No, you have to watch out for that poet. What's his name?"
"WALKER: The dude with the red face?"
"MEGAN: He just did a translation of the ""Bhagavad Gita."" Anyway, he acts like he's gay, but it's such a ruse. Total perv."
"RORY: Poet, red face, not gay, ""Bhagavad Gita,"" perv. Got it."
"SOFIA: I'm going to steal the bride to take a couple quick pictures. Honor, honey, grab your veil. The rest of you, 3-minute warning."
"RORY: You are dance-floor ready."
"HONOR: Thank you, my dear. See you soon, everybody."
"SOFIA: Head that way, toward the sitting room. We don't want Josh to see you in your dress. It's bad luck."
"HONOR: Please. Like I care about things like that."
"[Door closes]"
"MEGAN: I look like a drag queen."
"WALKER: My hair is insane."
"ALEXANDRA: I want your hair. My hair looks like Linda Kers. Italo was punishing me."
"WALKER: I'll tell you what I want, to hook up with someone tonight."
"ALEXANDRA: Just remember that pinning guys in the corner and shoving your tongue down their throats can sometimes come off as desperate."
"WALKER: But I am desperate, I swear. I might go home with the ambassador from Luxembourg."
"CLAUDE: Come on. There'll be plenty of eligible bachelors tonight."
"WALKER: Like who?"
"CLAUDE: The groomsmen, for starters."
"ALEXANDRA: Tripp Wallison is looking good."
"MEGAN: You always think he's looking good."
"ALEXANDRA: 'Cause he always is. Anyway, so do you."
"CLAUDE: Alexandra and Megan have both slept with Tripp."
"RORY: Small world."
"ALEXANDRA: I'm with Liam. You can have Tripp."
"WALKER: Tripp's too short. I'm over the whole Mia Farrow, Woody Allen thing."
"CLAUDE: How about Josh's brother?"
"WALKER: Poor man's josh? Really poor man's? He's the josh they give away at the soup kitchens."
"ALEXANDRA: Oh, there's always Logan."
"WALKER: Been there, done that."
"CLAUDE: Shush!"
"WALKER: What ""shush""? You should talk."
"CLAUDE: Rory is Logan's girlfriend."
"WALKER: Oops. Oh, my god, you're Rory-Rory. I'm so retarded. Don't worry. This was way before you guys started dating. This was back around Thanksgiving."
"RORY: [Confused] Last Thanksgiving?"
"WALKER: It meant nothing. Believe me, meaningless."
"MEGAN: Walker will have sex with anyone."
"WALKER: I will."
"CLAUDE: I'm sure you know Logan and I dated, but that was ages ago, eons, back when he drove a Z3. And then we had a stupid one-night stand this December, but there's nothing between us, I swear. We're just friends who drank too much spiked eggnog. Now he's met you, and you guys are so great together, really."
"RORY: [Still in shock] Thanks."
"ALEXANDRA: I didn't know you slept with Logan. I thought you two messed around."
"WALKER: No, you said you just messed around with him. I said that he and I hooked up. I meant hooked up-hooked up."
"ALEXANDRA: [To Walker] I thought you just meant messed around."
"MEGAN: [To Alexandra] How come you never told me you messed around with Logan. Why am I not in the loop?"
"ALEXANDRA: I'm with Liam. Officially, nothing happened. These shoes are k*ll my feet."
"WALKER: Just scrunch up your toes a little bit. That's what I'm doing. It feels good."
"RORY: Did you hook up with Logan around Thanksgiving?"
"MEGAN: No way. I was in Biarritz."
"SOFIA: Okay, ladies, time to line up. The processional is about to start. Rory, you better go find your seat."
"MEGAN: I look like Rupaul."
"WALKER: Where's my flowers? Does Sofia have the flowers?"
"CLAUDE: See you at the party, Rory."
"[Rory still in shock goes and sits down]"
"ALEXANDRA: Oh, just F.Y.I. Before I got together with Liam, he slept with half the upper east side, and now he's loyal as a dog."
"WALKER: I need my flowers. [Alexandra points to the bunch Walker is holding] Oh, I already have my flowers. Oops!"
"[All together the bridal part says ""Bye, Rory"" as she sits wondering what just happened]"
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is cleaning up]"
"LORELAI: I don't know how you did it, kid, but every single thing I own is now broken or missing. Oh, G.G., Hon, you're coloring on the floor there. The, the it's not enough the paper's near the marker. It has to actually be under it. [small laugh] G.G., Give me, oh, that's a permanent marker, honey. Give me that."
"G.G.: No!"
"LORELAI: Yes. Permanent marker causes permanent damage, which makes auntie Lorelai permanently bitter, now…"
"G.G.: No!"
"LORELAI: G.G. [Gasps as G.G. deliberately draws a line on the floor] Oh, my god! God, give me that. [Takes the marker from G.G.]"
"G.G.: [Screaming]"
"LORELAI: If that's your Donald Sutherland ""invasion of the body snatchers"" impression, it's a really good one. [Screaming continues] ""I'm sorry, ma'am, those tonsils are gonna have to come out."" [Screaming continues] G.G., Please, if you stop, I'll give you one of those caramel apples that I showed you, okay? They're delicious, but to get one you have to stop making the world's most annoying noise in 5, 4, 3, 2... [Screaming stops…Lorelai sighs] Thank you. Nothing a little eardrum replacement surgery won't fix. Come on, let's go in the kitchen. [she runs past Lorelai] G.G.? Hey, don't you go into Rory's room. You know you're not allowed in there. G.G.? Hey, you. [Door slams] I know this is a cliché, but just wait till your father gets home!"
"HONOR'S WEDDING – DRESSING ROOM"
"[Rory is still sitting on the same chair]"
"LOGAN: Here you are."
"RORY: Here I am."
"LOGAN: I was looking all over for you. I didn't see you when I was walking down the aisle. Looked for you during the ceremony. Where were you?"
"RORY: Here."
"LOGAN: Here? You missed the wedding?"
"RORY: I'll apologize to honor later."
"LOGAN: Forget Honor. What's going on? Rory."
"RORY: You didn't say a word. You just let me walk into a room full of girls you'd had sex with. Oh, no, wait. I'm sorry. You only had sex with two of them. One you just ""fooled around with,"" whatever that means. She spared me the parameters of the fooling around. You want to fill me in?"
"LOGAN: Rory."
"RORY: You know what? Never mind. I've got a good imagination. I can figure it out."
"LOGAN: Okay, look."
"RORY: I can't believe it, you didn't just cheat on me, you really cheated on me."
"LOGAN: I didn't cheat on you."
"RORY: Oh, so you didn't sleep with…"
"LOGAN: No, I did, but we were broken up."
"RORY: No, you were broken up, not me. I thought we were just taking some time."
"LOGAN: Apart, not seeing each other."
"RORY: Yes, taking some time, not seeing each other for a while. That doesn't mean ""broken up."""
"LOGAN: Oh, come on."
"RORY: No! When… To break up, you have to tell the other person. You can't just decide that you're broken off and then just go off and...god, I can't believe I fell for all your stupid tricks, the coffee cart and going to my mother. You went to my mother. Why would you bother going through that? You had plenty of backup. What do you need me for?"
"LOGAN: Because I love you."
"RORY: No. Don't."
"LOGAN: Rory, I didn't cheat on you. I didn't lie to you."
"RORY: You didn't tell me."
"LOGAN: Of course not. Why would I want you to be hurt and upset and angry?"
"RORY: ""Blondie, dizzy"", I love the cover, pretending all those girls were worthless idiots."
"LOGAN: They are worthless idiots, sh**ting their mouths off in front of you like that."
"RORY: It's not their fault."
"LOGAN: It is their fault. They love doing crap like this, causing trouble."
"RORY: We were only apart for like two seconds, and you managed to sleep with every one of your sister's friends. How did you even do that? I mean, did you work them in shifts? Were there charts, signals, b-12 shots?"
"LOGAN: I was depressed. I was lonely. I was upset. I've known these girls forever. It was just companionship, okay? It meant nothing."
"RORY: Don't be at the apartment between 10:00 and 1:00 tomorrow so I can get my stuff."
"[Rory leaves]"
"LUKE'S DINER – NIGHT"
"[It's busy]"
"CAESAR: Coffee on it's way."
"[A customer leaves and Kirk snatches some toast off his plate]"
"KIRK: What?"
"LANE: You're disgusting, and you're cheating on your juice diet."
"KIRK: I didn't cheat. I expanded the definition of ""juice""... I feel dirty."
"ZACH: Hey."
"LANE: We're out of food."
"KIRK: What?!"
"ZACH: I have to talk to you a sec. I went to a Bat Mitzvah last night."
"LANE: [To Zach] Mazel tov. [To Babette] You want some more coffee?"
"BABETTE: What the hell."
"ZACH: I talked to the guys."
"LANE: I know you ripped my flyer down."
"ZACH: What?"
"LANE: My ""drummer wanted"" flyer at Sophie's. It was ripped down, and Lou said he saw you do it. I just want you to know that I think that sucks."
"ZACH: Well, ""a,"" Lou's a fathead, and, two, I had my reasons. Come on, Lane, stop. I have to talk to you."
"LANE: About what? What do you have to talk to me about, Zach?"
"ZACH: I have to talk to you about how it's all feeling wrong. I tried to write a song about it, and I was gonna bring my amp and axe and play it for you. But it was coming out way too Emo, so I decided to just say it. [takes a deep breath] I get up in the morning and I don't feel good. I go to work and I don't feel good. I come home and I don't feel good. I brush my teeth and I don't feel good. Then I go to bed and I don't feel good. Then I wake up and I don't feel good. And then I go to work and I don't feel good."
"BABETTE: You don't feel good! We get it! Go on!"
"LUKE: Hey, is something burning down here?"
"LANE: Luke, shh!"
"LUKE: Okay, sorry."
"LANE: Go on."
"ZACH: Right. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Lane, will you marry me?"
"[People in the diner gasp.]"
"LANE: What?"
"ZACH: [Softly] Will you marry me?"
"LANE: But...do you even know what you're saying? I mean, have you even thought about this? [Zach pulls a ring from his pocket] Oh, my god, you have thought about this."
"ZACH: I got it at the pawn shop. It belonged to like an Elk or a Moose or something. But it looked cool, and I could afford it, so I got it. [Hands the ring to Lane] You're smiling."
"LANE: I know."
"ZACH: Does this mean yes?"
"LANE: Yes. It means yes."
"ZACH: Really? Cool."
"BABETTE: For god's sakes, kiss him, sugar!"
"KIRK: [Eating] Yeah, kiss him, sugar! [Cheers and applause as they kiss.]"
"LANE: So...I should get back to work."
"ZACH: It's okay. I wasn't thinking the ceremony should be today or anything."
"LANE: I'm off at 8:00."
"ZACH: I'll swing by."
"LANE: [Walks behind the counter, to Luke] I'm getting married."
"LUKE: I heard."
"LANE: [Giggles, and starts handing food and a toaster to customers, she's in a daze. Luke puts the toaster back and plates to customer who are meant to get them.]"
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Doorbell rings, Lorelai answers it.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hi, Mary Poppins."
"LORELAI: [Chuckles] Sorry, the place is a mess."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's okay. I left my white gloves at home."
"LORELAI: So, how'd it go with you today?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Great. I got everything done. It was actually nice spending some time with my mom."
"LORELAI: Good."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, what, you lose my kid? Should I call the milk carton people?"
"LORELAI: Oh, she's asleep in Rory's room."
"CHRISTOPHER: She's all tuckered out, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, either that or she knocked herself out. She was throwing books around Rory's room."
"CHRISTOPHER: What do you mean?"
"LORELAI: Well, when she was done drawing on the floor and pouring chocolate milk on Paul Anka, then she took to throwing books around for a while. This was before the spitting and the furniture kicking and the grand finale where she pulled all the sheets off the bed and tried to flush them down the toilet."
"CHRISTOPHER: You're kidding."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm really not."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, she's a spirited kid."
"LORELAI: Spirited, possessed. Potato, po-tah-to."
"CHRISTOPHER: 3-year-olds can be a lot to handle. If you're not used it, I'm sure it can be overwhelming."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, no, this wasn't 3-year-old hard-to-handle. This was feral hyena hard-to-handle."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, you guys didn't click."
"LORELAI: Chris, this is not about clicking. This is about spoiled."
"CHRISTOPHER: Spoiled?"
"LORELAI: Yes, G.G. Has clearly never heard the word ""no"" in her entire life."
"CHRISTOPHER: She's heard the word ""no."""
"LORELAI: Well, at no time did me saying ""no"" elicit anything other than a scream. I said, ""no coloring on the floor"", she screamed. I said, ""no pulling Paul Anka's tail"", she screamed. I tried discussing Japanese Noh theater with her. She screamed."
"CHRISTOPHER: So what?"
"LORELAI: I'm not saying it's her fault. I'm saying I think you could apply a little more discipline."
"CHRISTOPHER: She's a kid. Kids are hard."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know kids. I raised one, okay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Kids are different today. It's a different world. They need more nurturing, more space."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. Uh, yes, that was Dr. Spock turning over in his grave."
"CHRISTOPHER: We're going."
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Come on, Chris. It isn't just me. Those preschool interviews?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Those people don't know what they're talking about."
"LORELAI: And the nanny?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Is a flake."
"LORELAI: [Sighs] You know giving G.G. Whatever she wants isn't gonna make up for Sherry being a crappy mom and bailing."
"CHRISTOPHER: You know what? I've had enough of your advice and your help. [Chris carries G.G. out]"
"RICH MAN'S SHOE"
"[Rory is drunk]"
"RORY: Hit me, barkeep."
"BARTENDER: That's your third one."
"RORY: What are you, my mother?"
"BARTENDER: No."
"RORY: No, you're not. I'm not driving, and I live right over... there, or somewhere near there. Or there. But it's close, and I'm walking, and I want another drink."
"BARTENDER: Okay."
"RORY: [Sighs] Hey! These are mine."
"WAITRESS: I was just gonna get them out of your way."
"RORY: Don't take what's mine. These came with my drinks. He put them down in front of me. I did not ask you to move them, did I?"
"WAITRESS: Whatever."
"RORY: Snappy comeback. Dorothy Parker know about you? Sick of people touching my stuff."
"BARTENDER: [Hands Rory the drink] Here you go. [Puts a bowl of nuts on the bar] Eat something."
"RORY: You eat something. [pays for the drink]"
"DOYLE: Well, hello, Rory. Fancy meeting you here."
"RORY: Hi, Doyle."
"DOYLE: I didn't see you sitting here, or I would've come over sooner. I've been here a while. I've been mixing beer and wine and Malibu rum."
"RORY: That sounds bad."
"DOYLE: Yep, it is bad. It's been a long, bad night. How about you? How's your night been?"
"RORY: [Sarcastically] Really excellent."
"DOYLE: Okay, well, then, let's drink to really excellent evenings."
"[They toast]"
"RORY: To really excellent evenings."
"DOYLE: Paris threw me out."
"RORY: What? No. Why?"
"DOYLE: I told her you were thinking of making her ""Campus Safety"" piece a series and that I told you not to."
"RORY: Why would you do that?"
"DOYLE: I don't know. It just came out. We were fighting. She was miserable and not sleeping and just sitting at that craft table, hot-gluing bead after bead after bead. And then when I tried to take the glue g*n out of her hand, all hell broke loose."
"RORY: Oh, boy."
"DOYLE: She kicked me out, told me to leave. I came here."
"RORY: That sucks."
"DOYLE: I drank a lot."
"RORY: Love sucks."
"DOYLE: Went and bought a car for that woman."
"RORY: Me too."
"DOYLE: Now I have to move out."
"RORY: Me too."
"DOYLE: You too, what?"
"RORY: I have to move out of Logan's apartment."
"DOYLE: Why?"
"RORY: Because Logan had many, many blondes for thanksgiving."
"DOYLE: Sounds terrible. Did you love him?"
"RORY: Yep."
"DOYLE: It's terrible when you love 'em."
"RORY: I don't know where I'm gonna go."
"DOYLE: I'm staying with two guys who have black-light posters on every single wall. It's depressing."
"RORY: You guys will get back together. You and Paris are perfect for each other."
"DOYLE: I mean, there's socks hanging everywhere. I don't even know if they're clean socks. They're just hanging. I wonder what Paris is doing now."
"RORY: I wonder how long till Logan sleeps with somebody else… Bet he already has. [Takes a last drink] Ohh, empty. Sad."
"BARTENDER: How we doing?"
"RORY: Fine. We're fine."
"DOYLE: I want to die."
"RORY: I want more. You want more?"
"DOYLE: Uh-huh."
"RORY: Oh, rats. I'm out of money. I had to take a cab back from New York, so of course I have no drinking money."
"DOYLE: I've got money. It's in something in my pants, somewhere down here in this general area. I'll hold still while you look."
"RORY: No, that's okay. I'm gonna go."
"DOYLE: Yeah? Okay. I'll go, too. [Gets off the stool too quick.] Oh, bad move. Bad, bad move."
"RORY: Come on. I got you."
"[They exit the pub]"
"RORY: Doyle, use your feet."
"DOYLE: It's cold. I'm cold."
"RORY: You want my coat?"
"DOYLE: Okay. [Rory taes it off and Doyle puts it on] This is lovely."
"RORY: Thank you."
"DOYLE: Okay, well, thanks for the company."
"RORY: Yeah, you too."
"DOYLE: Bye, Rory."
"RORY: Bye, Doyle. [They hug and Doyle starts to kiss Rory on the neck] Uh, Doyle? Doyle, what are you doing?"
"DOYLE: Uh..."
"RORY: You were kissing my neck."
"DOYLE: Oh, god, I was. I was kissing your neck. And I was nuzzling, too."
"RORY: There was definitely nuzzling."
"DOYLE: I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me."
"RORY: And you used your tongue."
"DOYLE: I just miss her so much."
"RORY: Doyle, go home."
"DOYLE: I don't have a home."
"RORY: Yes, you do. You have a home with black-light posters and dirty socks. I don't have a home."
"DOYLE: Oh, right."
"RORY: Night, Doyle. [Starts to walk away] Oh, my god, could this day get any worse?"
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai is cleaning the floor, the telephone rings]"
"LORELAI: [Growns then answers] Yeah?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Lor?"
"LORELAI: Ah, well, if it isn't Da Vinci's daddy."
"CHRISTOPHER: How's the floor?"
"LORELAI: Very festive."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry about that. I'll have a floor guy come fix it."
"LORELAI: Well, don't worry about it. The house was too perfect. Now it's lived-in."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well..."
"LORELAI: You're awfully quiet. G.G. Got a g*n on you or something?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry, Lor."
"LORELAI: Oh, Chris."
"CHRISTOPHER: I was so far out of line."
"LORELAI: Don't worry about it."
"CHRISTOPHER: Everything you said, you were… so right."
"LORELAI: I hate when that happens."
"CHRISTOPHER: G.G. Is completely out of control. I can't say no to her. I'm just -- I'm just so... I don't know. I'm so mad at Sherry for taking off like that. I mean, who leaves a kid?"
"LORELAI: Well..."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, I know. I left a kid. I tell you, Lor, I don't think I really got how you felt about me until now because I want to k*ll Sherry."
"LORELAI: I never wanted to k*ll you. I wanted to key your car, which I did once, by the way."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's not right that G.G. Doesn't get a mom. It's not right that all she has is me. What a super bargain that is."
"LORELAI: Oh, Chris, come on."
"CHRISTOPHER: I don't want her to feel like she's missing anything. I want her to be happy."
"LORELAI: I know."
"CHRISTOPHER: I can't get her into a school. No one will take her. They say she's uncontrollable and aggressive and all sorts of other horrible-sounding terms."
"LORELAI: Well, school is overrated. Ask Abraham Lincoln."
"CHRISTOPHER: I suck as a dad."
"LORELAI: No, you don't. Look, I get the single-parent guilt, but in the end, G.G. Needs you to say no."
"CHRISTOPHER: I know. I've ruined her."
"LORELAI: You haven't ruined her. It's not too late."
"CHRISTOPHER: You sure?"
"LORELAI: I'm positive. You can turn this around. I know you can. You're a great guy with a great heart. You just need to be a little tougher."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah."
"LORELAI: I'll help you in any way I can. I promise. We'll fix this."
"CHRISTOPHER: You're amazing, Lor."
"LORELAI: Only in the true sense of the word."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thanks for being around."
"LORELAI: Any time."
"CHRISTOPHER: [Glass shatters, G.G. Screams. Sighs ] I got to..."
"LORELAI: I know. Go. [Ends the phone call]"
"HALLWAY TO PARIS'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory sighs and knocks on the door]"
"PARIS: Get the bowls and chopsticks out, guys. Somebody pick a movie already. [The door opens] I thought you were Hing Yee's."
"RORY: Sorry."
"PARIS: What do you want?"
"RORY: Can I talk to you for a sec?"
"PARIS: Fine. [Unchains the door and lets her in.]"
"RORY: Where is everybody?"
"PARIS: I ordered food for 10, and I didn't want the delivery guy to look at me like I was a hog. I don't need to display my pathetic ness to the world."
"RORY: You're not pathetic, Paris."
"PARIS: Doyle and I broke up."
"RORY: I know. I sort of ran into Doyle earlier."
"PARIS: Oh, yeah?"
"RORY: Yeah, he looked pretty upset."
"PARIS: I don't care."
"RORY: Okay."
"PARIS: So, is that why you came over here, 'cause you heard that we broke up?"
"RORY: Well...yes."
"PARIS: You're a really good friend."
"RORY: Oh, not really."
"PARIS: I throw you out, I treat you like dirt, no one else can stand me, but you come over to make sure I'm all right."
"RORY: Well, Paris?"
"PARIS: Yeah?"
"RORY: In the name of full disclosure, I should tell you, Logan and I broke up, too, today. I'm moving out."
"PARIS: How come?"
"RORY: He cheated on me...with an entire wedding party."
"PARIS: Oh… Nice."
"RORY: Yeah."
"PARIS: Men suck."
"RORY: They do suck."
"PARIS: Can't count on them. They never have your back."
"RORY: No, they don't."
"PARIS: They make you love them, and then they let you down, and you're walking around with a stomachache for the next six months."
"RORY: Is that how long it lasts?"
"PARIS: I don't know. I hope it's only six months."
"RORY: Yeah, me too."
"PARIS: You can stay here, you know, if you want."
"RORY: Really?"
"PARIS: Sure. Take my room if you want. I've been sleeping at my crafts table lately."
"RORY: Thanks, Paris."
"PARIS: Sure… Hungry? I got food coming."
"RORY: Starving."
"PARIS: Hey, I just realized, when the food arrives, now I really can ask someone to get the bowls. Silver lining, huh?"
"RORY: Sure is."
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM"
"[Lorelai is in bed, telephone rings]"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"RORY: Hey, it's me."
"LORELAI: Hey, you! How was the wedding?"
"RORY: Sucko. I've got a new address for you."
"LORELAI: Uh-oh."

"PARIS'S APARTMENT"
"[Paris and Rory are on the couch eating talk out food, it is the same night as the last episodes.]"
"PARIS: I say we repaint."
"RORY: Did you ever paint?"
"PARIS: No, Doyle doesn't believe in improving someone else's property."
"RORY: Men!"
"PARIS: Yeah, men."
"RORY: Well, we will repaint."
"PARIS: A new color scheme for a new era."
"RORY: I'll eat to that."
"[They toast by knocking chopsticks together]"
"PARIS: Hey this is gonna be great. You and me and a freshly painted apartment, no men -- just lots and lots of Chinese food."
"RORY: We are going to get huge."
"PARIS: That's okay. We'll get a treadmill."
"RORY: Yeah, you always wanted a treadmill."
"PARIS: I did. Doyle thought, ""why get a treadmill when you can walk outside?"""
"RORY: With all the m*rder and rapists."
"PARIS: Exactly what I would say. I'm glad you're back."
"RORY: Me too… You know, Paris, I'm really sorry about the whole editorship thing."
"PARIS: It's okay."
"RORY: I didn't lobby for the job. I mean, I swear I had no idea."
"PARIS: Forget it. I mean, who are we kidding? I am not cut out to deal with people. I was made to be in a lab or an operating room or a bunker somewhere with a well-behaved monkey by my side. I'm sorry, too, you know, for throwing you out."
"RORY: Consider it even."
"[Knock on door]"
"PARIS: Did we actually order that pizza?"
"RORY: I thought it was just discussed."
"PARIS: [shouting] Who is it?"
"LOGAN: It's Logan."
"RORY: I don't want to talk to him."
"PARIS: I got it. [Paris gets up and opens the door] Well, well, if it isn't new haven's favorite whore hound."
"LOGAN: Is Rory here?"
"PARIS: Yes."
"LOGAN: Can I talk to her?"
"PARIS: No. You can talk to me. [She shuts the door to unchain it] What do you want to talk about -- life, love, common symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases?"
"LOGAN: Rory."
"PARIS: Rashes, sores, insanity."
"LOGAN: Five minutes, please!"
"PARIS: You know, there's a few things I've always wanted to say to you, but out of respect for my friend Rory here, I've refrained. However, the circumstances seem to have changed."
"LOGAN: You don't know what you're talking about Paris..."
"PARIS: I know you cheated on Rory."
"LOGAN: I did not cheat on Rory."
"PARIS: Are you going to deny it? Are you serious?"
"LOGAN: We were apart."
"PARIS: Oh, please!"
"LOGAN: We were! We weren't together! And why the hell am I arguing with you? I don't want you back."
"PARIS: You, Logan Huntzberger, are nothing but a two-bit, [he tries to push past Paris] spoiled waste of a trust fund. You offer nothing to women or the world in general. If you were to disappear from the face of the earth tomorrow, the only person that would miss you is your Porsche dealer."
"LOGAN: Want to chime in here?"
"RORY: No, I think Paris has got it covered."
"LOGAN: [Pushing his way past Paris] Okay, that's it."
"PARIS: Wait! Hey!"
"LOGAN: Rory, I just need 60 seconds."
"RORY: Go away, Logan."
"PARIS: No one invited you in. Get out right now before I go Bonaduce on your ass."
"LOGAN: I'm not going anywhere. I', not going anywhere. We're gonna talk."
"DOYLE: What the hell is this door doing unlocked?"
"PARIS: What are you doing here?"
"DOYLE: [shuts the door] I want to talk to you."
"PARIS: I told you to go."
"DOYLE: You did, and I did. I left, and I got drunk, and I thought about why I left and got drunk, and I realized that you are wrong."
"PARIS: I am not! And what are you wearing?"
"DOYLE: Don't change the subject!"
"LOGAN: [to Rory] Can we go in the other room?"
"DOYLE: We're supposed to be together, Paris. You know it, I know it, your life coach knows it."
"PARIS: Terrence has been wrong before. When I wanted to get the pageboy haircut, remember?"
"DOYLE: Paris, listen to me. I'm the best thing that ever happened to you."
"PARIS: Well, if that's true, then it's all uphill from here."
"DOYLE: I didn't have to come back here begging you to talk to me. I have options."
"PARIS: Right."
"DOYLE: I do! In fact, I almost hooked up with a really hot chick tonight."
"RORY: I don't see how that's gonna help your case, Doyle, at all. [to Logan] Know what Fine. Let's take this out into the hall."
"PARIS: You could have hooked up with a hot chick?"
"DOYLE: Yes."
"PARIS: In rhinestone buttons? Who was it -- Sheila E.?"
"[in the hall]"
"RORY: Two minutes. Go."
"LOGAN: Look, I understand that you're upset, and I really wish you hadn't found out like that, but I love you. You know that I love you. When I said that I was your boyfriend, I agreed to be faithful to you, which was a first for me. And I thought it was gonna be hard, but it wasn't. Then I asked you to move in with me, I asked you to move in with me, and I thought that was gonna be hard, but it wasn't. I have been completely faithful to you, Rory. I have not been with another girl."
"RORY: Ha!"
"LOGAN: I've not even thought about another girl."
"RORY: Except for Walker, Alexandra..."
"LOGAN: We were broken up, Rory."
"RORY: No, you were."
"LOGAN: I thought we were broken up. I thought that's what the fight was. I thought that's what the separation was. Do you believe me? Do you believe that I honestly thought we weren't together?"
"RORY: I guess."
"LOGAN: So then, if you believe that, that I thought we weren't together, then do you believe that, in my mind, I was not cheating on you?"
"RORY: I guess."
"LOGAN: So then if you believe that, in my mind, I was not cheating on you, do you think you can forget what those vipers said today, put it behind you, and just come home with me? Come on, Rory. Just come home with me. Let's forget this crappy day ever happened, just go home. [pause] You want to make a pro/con list?"
"RORY: Do not mock my pro/con list."
"LOGAN: I am not mocking your pro/con list. I actually think the list will come out in my favor."
"RORY: [Sighs] Well, I'd have to tell Paris I'm going."
"LOGAN: Absolutely, tell Paris you're going."
"RORY: [opens the apartment door] Whoa! Oh!"
"LOGAN: What?"
"RORY: They made up. Either that or Krav Maga is way kinkier than I thought it was."
"LOGAN: Well, you can tell her tomorrow. After all, it is tomorrow."
"RORY: Yeah, yeah, I can just call her from home."
"LOGAN: Hey. We okay?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"[Logan puts is arm around Rory and they walk out]"

"LUKE'S APARTMENT"
"[Luke is on the Phone, Lorelai comes out of the bathroom]"
"LUKE: Yeah sure, we'll see."
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: [puts his hand up] Okay. [Lorelai look amusingly at his hand] Call you later. [hangs up the phone."
"LORELAI: Did you not hear me screaming?"
"LUKE: You were screaming?"
"LORELAI: Yes like Janet Leigh in ""psycho."""
"LUKE: I was one the phone, why were you screaming?"
"LORELAI: There was a spider in the shower. I trapped him under a soap dish. I need you to go in and get him and take him outside."
"LUKE: Right."
"LORELAI: Scoop him up gently. You do not want to break his little legs. Spiders are all about their legs. [takes a breath] I was shampooing. Everything was fine. I looked up, and there he was!"
"LUKE: Holy mackerel."
"LORELAI: Yeah, he's a big boy. Don't hurt him."
"LUKE: I won't."
"LORELAI: I was talking to the spider. [Sighs…something crashes in the bath room] What happened? Are you okay?"
"LUKE: Yeah, he's got a posse."
"LORELAI: You're kidding."
"LUKE: Arr, I am not kidding."
"LORELAI: What are you gonna do?"
"LUKE: There isn't a soap dish in town big enough for these guys."
"LORELAI: Be careful."
"LUKE: I just got to trap them, move them out of the shower, and then sell the building."
"LORELAI: Ha."
"LUKE: So, that was April on the phone."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: April called. Seems their math team made it into some national contest."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, good for her."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's pretty big. They're all going to Philadelphia next week. Bunch of the parents are supposed to chaperone. Anna was gonna go, but now she can't, so April called me."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: Yeah, it's weird, 'cause usually it's me calling her to do things. This is the first time that she's called me."
"LORELAI: Well, good. That's progress, right?"
"LUKE: I think so, but I can't take a week off from the diner. Plus, you and I probably have all sorts of plans next week."
"LORELAI: Not that we I of, oh, wait was next week the week we were gonna start our lives as outlaws?"
"LUKE: Well, I just assumed we had stuff to do next week."
"LORELAI: No."
"LUKE: Oh."
"LORELAI: You should go."
"LUKE: You think?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she asked you. She called you and I know that traveling across country in a bus full of little man Tates has been a lifelong dream of yours."
"LUKE: Well, okay. I think I will go."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: Yeah you know I looked up the route last night. Sounds like a great trip. They'll be visiting constitution hall and stopping in Gettysburg. Do you know I have never seen the liberty bell?"
"LORELAI: Communist."
"LUKE: Okay I'm gonna take these guys outside. Any particular place you want them?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, someplace shady, shelter from the elements and, ideally, near a talking pig."
"LUKE: I asked. I have no one to blame but myself."
"THE BANDS APARTMENT"
"[Zach and Brian are playing a video came, Lane is unpacking]"
"ZACH: There's still a glare, right?"
"BRIAN: Huge glare, I can't make out all the details of castle siege."
"ZACH: And those trolls, you've got to squint to see them."
"LANE: The TV's fine, guys. It's in exactly the same place it used to be."
"ZACH: Dude, wait till you hear how I soundproofed Lane's old room. Pier 1 cushions wall-to-wall, perfect acoustics."
"LANE: Band practice officially starts back up tomorrow."
"ZACH: Dude, you want this bottom drawer, too?"
"BRIAN: Sure, a sock drawer."
"ZACH: Nothing is gayer than a sock drawer."
"BRIAN: Really, there's got to be something gayer than a sock drawer."
"LANE: Okay, before you guys get too deeply entrenched in the ""what's gayer than a sock drawer"" conversation, I'm gonna say goodbye. [kisses Zach] Goodbye."
"ZACH: Goodbye."
"LANE: Bye, Brian."
"BRIAN: Bye, Lane. Thanks for the help."
"LANE: Hey, make sure you behave yourself out there. You're almost a married woman."
"BRIAN: Hey, what happens when you guys get married?"
"ZACH: Well, we finally get to have sex."
"LANE: [embarrassed and quietly] Zack."
"BRIAN: No, I mean, I just moved in here. But when you guys get married, do I move out again?"
"[Lane and Zach look at each other]"
"LANE: We haven't really discussed that yet."
"ZACH: Yeah, well, we can move the band equipment back out here, me and Lane will take the room. You can have the bunk beds all to yourself."
"BRIAN: Cool!"
"LANE: Ah Zach, don't you think we should get our own apartment when we get married?"
"ZACH: But this is a great apartment."
"LANE: I know this is a great apartment."
"BRIAN: I thought you liked Brian."
"LANE: I do. I just think maybe we'd want our own place."
"ZACH: Our own place? Okay. Wow. I tell you, this marriage thing major. Every day, something huge to think about."
"LANE: Speaking of huge, you need to talk to my mom."
"BRIAN: You haven't told Mrs. Kim yet?"
"ZACH: Don't worry I'm heading over there today."
"LANE: You are? Are you ready? You have a clean shirt? You sewed up your pants?"
"ZACH: Everything's under control, hunter and gatherer and all that crap. Go to work. Okay. Call me the minute you talk to her. [they kiss again, then Lane leaves]"
"BRIAN: You got yourself a good woman there."
"ZACH: Yep, I do. You are officially moved back in."
"BRIAN: Cool. [they look at the TV] Hey wasn't the TV facing the other way?"
"ZACH: Yes that's it. It's good to have you home man. It's good to have you home. [They more the TV and agree it's right now ""Oh, yeah"".]"
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Lorelai enters]"
"LORELAI: Hey, when you come over later tonight, I have a cricket cornered under a paper cup in the living room. I poked holes in the top, so he could breath and then I taped it to the floor 'cause he kept jumping out. And I put books on top of the tape, incase it wasn't sticky enough so don't move the books until you're ready for transport. What are you doing?"
"LUKE: I'm sewing my duffel bag."
"LORELAI: That's crazy."
"LUKE: That's crazy?"
"LORELAI: Yeah that thing's 100 years old. Just throw it away."
"LUKE: The bag is fine."
"LORELAI: That is not a bag. That is a collection of molecules tethered together by dirt."
"LUKE: I'll get you your coffee in a minute."
"LORELAI: Luke, come on. You're going on a major trip next week. Spring for some real luggage."
"LUKE: I don't need any luggage."
"LORELAI: I'll go shopping with you. We can hit the mall later."
"LUKE: I don't want to go shopping. I don't want to hit the mall. I will fix this bag, and it will be fine."
"LORELAI: All right I'll so shopping alone I can pick something out for you."
"LUKE: I appreciate the offer, but I'm fine. Ow! [he pricks him self with the needle."
"LANE: Ooh, that's the third time he's stabbed himself this morning."
"LORELAI: Maybe we should put him on su1c1de watch."
"LANE: Couldn't hurt."
"LUKE: Hey, there's customers to talk to if you're lonely. Ow!"
"LORELAI: I can't believe you think shopping is more painful than this!"
"LANE: Oh, I'll be right back."
"[Lane goes out side]"
"LANE: Rory, I can't believe you're here!"
"RORY: Oh, I just thought I'd, whoa! Wow, these small towns are mighty friendly."
"LANE: I have some really, really big news."
"RORY: What? [Lane shows Rory the ring[ You've become a Shriner."
"LORELAI: Bleeding stop yet?"
"LUKE: It's fine."
"LORELAI: You sure you don't want me to call an ambulance, or a Tumi store? [Lorelai here's the girls shrieking outside] Rory's here!"
"LUKE: She is?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, she's outside bouncing around with Lane."
"LUKE: How come she came home?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, bouncing lessons?"
"RORY: Did you hear?"
"LORELAI: Did I hear what?"
"RORY: Show her, show her, show her!"
"LORELAI: You won the super bowl?"
"LANE: I'm engaged."
"LORELAI: No!"
"RORY: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Let me see the ring again."
"LANE: It's all Zach could afford, but I think it's rock 'n' roll. It's the rocking and the rolling-est. I'm so excited for you, Lane. That's awesome!"
"LANE: Thanks I would have told you earlier, but I thought you knew."
"LORELAI: Why would I know?"
"LANE: Well Luke was standing right there when it happened."
"LORELAI: You knew?"
"LUKE: Um, yeah."
"LORELAI: Did you forget to tell me?"
"LUKE: No, I just thought that Lane would want to tell you herself."
"LORELAI: You forgot to tell me."
"LUKE: Fine, sure. I forgot to tell you. So what? I remember being engaged to you. Isn't that enough?"
"CUSTOMER: Can I get some more coffee?"
"LANE: I'll be right back."
"RORY: Oh, I am so hungry. Do you think Luke would be willing to make us S'mores today?"
"LORELAI: Hey, for you, anything. So, nice surprise."
"RORY: What Lane?"
"LORELAI: No, you showing up. I didn't expect it, you being such a modern, busy woman and all."
"RORY: Well, I can bring home the bacon and fry it up in a pan."
"LORELAI: So, any special occasion I should know about?"
"RORY: No, I just thought I could use a good Stars Hollow fix for a couple days. How crazy are things at the inn?"
"LORELAI: Absolutely insane. However, for you, I can play a little hooky."
"RORY: What a role model."
"LORELAI: Well, I try. So, what's new? You okay?"
"RORY: Yeah, why?"
"LORELAI: Well, Logan and moving out."
"RORY: Oh, right. About that. Remember the new address?"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Cross it out. I'm back to the old one."
"LORELAI: What? Back at Logan's?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: How did this happen?"
"RORY: He came over to Paris' last night, and we talked. He explained everything."
"LORELAI: So there's an explanation?"
"RORY: Yeah, and we're fine now."
"LORELAI: You're fine. But what about the bridesmaids?"
"RORY: Misunderstanding. Everything's good."
"LUKE: Here, start on these. I'm making you some S'mores."
"RORY: He's the most beautiful man in the world."
"LORELAI: Yeah, you should see him carry a spider outside."
"DRAGONFLY INN – FRONT DESK"
"[Rory is on her cell phone and Michel is behind the desk]"
"RORY: A.K., It's a lacrosse piece. It's fine. Well I'm sorry I can't give you more feedback, but until five minutes ago, I didn't even know Yale had a Lacrosse team. So when I criticize a piece, you think I hate it. When I don't criticize a piece, you think I hate it. Do you want me to hate you, A.K.? Because it's becoming a possibility. Wonderful, in that case, I will continue to be a fan of you and your work. Goodbye."
"MICHEL: You're quite the busy bee."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, well, writers can be temperamental."
"MICHEL: I'm sure… You like neon?"
"RORY: Sorry?"
"MICHEL: I see you're making liberal use of my pink neon post-it notes."
"RORY: I'm sorry. Would you like me to reimburse you for the seven pink neon post-it notes that I have used? 'Cause I'd be happy to if you can break a penny."
"MICHEL: No, little Lorelai, it's not the cost that is the problem. It's the disruption."
"RORY: Disruption?"
"MICHEL: Of the system."
"RORY: I see."
"MICHEL: Do you?"
"RORY: No."
"MICHEL: The pink neon post-it notes are used for guests who are checking in. The green neon post-it notes are for guests checking out. And the watermelon post-it notes are for guests who have altered or cancelled their reservations. As you can see, the pink neon stack is now woefully out of balance with the green neon stack, creating the illusion that more guests have been checking in than checking out, which, of course, is a physical impossibility unless we have g*n m*rder them."
"LORELAI: [They are stare at each other as Lorelai enters the room,] Are you guys having a staring contest? 'Cause I think for it to be official, you have to be seated."
"MICHEL: I was just filling your daughter in on the inner workings of the dragonfly."
"LORELAI: Oh, what did she do?"
"RORY: I took some post-its."
"LORELAI: But the system!"
"RORY: It will never happen again."
"LORELAI: Michel, you have my deep and sincere apology. She was raised better than that. [slaps Rory on the wrist]"
"RORY: Oh, actually, I did it with the other hand. [Lorelai slaps the other wrist]"
"MICHEL: I'm going on my break."
"RORY: He seems good."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's the yoga. [cell phone rings] So, you ready for the movie?"
"RORY: Yeah. Let me get my stuff."
"LORELAI: [answering the phone] Hello."
"EMILY: Lorelai, it's your mother! I'm calling you from the car!"
"LORELAI: You're not calling to me from a car, so stop yelling."
"EMILY: But you're on speakerphone!"
"LORELAI: I stand by my earlier position."
"EMILY: Fine. How far is it from Preston to New London? [the car navigation system, woman speaking German]"
"LORELAI: What's going on? Where are you?"
"EMILY: In Preston, apparently, though we're supposed to be at an estate sale in new London."
"RICHARD: This bag of bolts."
"EMILY: And this GPS contraption your father insisted on buying is speaking German."
"LORELAI: Well, New London's right near Stars Hollow, and Preston's not."
"EMILY: I knew it!"
"LORELAI: Still yelling."
"EMILY: Richard, what are you doing? Why are you stopping?"
"RICHARD: Because this contraption, as you call it, can only be used when the car is stopped."
"EMILY: So every time we want to ask the machine for directions, we have to pull over to the side of the road?"
"RICHARD: It would appear so. I thought the point of the machine was to avoid pulling over to ask directions."
"LORELAI: If I told people, they wouldn't believe it."
"RORY: What's going on?"
"LORELAI: Apparently, there's a fight to the death between Richard and Emily and an evil German supercomputer."
"RORY: I want to hear."
"LORELAI: Oh. [Lorelai puts the cell on speaker phone]"
"EMILY: I thought we paid $4,000 for a computer to give us directions, not to babysit us and make decisions for us about how to live our lives. I mean what's next, the radio won't turn on if it doesn't like the song? The engine won't start if the cup of coffee I'm holding is too hot? Maybe the car won't go in reverse if it doesn't like my perfume?"
"RICHARD: At the moments Emily, I would be happy if I could just get the damn thing to stop barking at me in German."
"LORELAI: Hi! Hi! Remember me? Yeah, you called me like 45 minutes ago."
"EMILY: Yes, Lorelai, I'm still here."
"LORELAI: Right, in Preston, about 20 miles off course."
"EMILY: 20 miles! I told you, Richard!"
"RICHARD: What you said, Emily, was to turn south when I wanted to turn north."
"LORELAI: Next time, you guys should call before you head out. You could have stopped by. [Lorelai starts laughing]"
"GPS SYSTEM: At the next light, turn right."
"RICHARD: Ha! There we are, English at last."
"EMILY: [to Lorelai] Well, we still could. We were only staying at the estate sale for a little while."
"LORELAI: [panicked] What? No, no. You guys have already gone way past Stars Hollow."
"EMILY: It's not problem we don't mind going a little out of our way, do we, Richard?"
"RICHARD: Certainly not."
"EMILY: When should she expect us?"
"RICHARD: Oh, about 4:30. Wait, wait! I don't want you guys to have to make a special trip. That really, really wouldn't make any sense. That's crazy! That's like asylum crazy. Besides, Rory and I were just about to head out for a movie."
"EMILY: Rory's there?"
"LORELAI: Damn!"
"EMILY: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: Damn straight."
"EMILY: Wonderful! We'll see you both around 4:30."
"LORELAI: [hangs up the phone] Damn it."
"KIM'S ANTIQUES"
"[Mrs Kim is dusting and Zach comes in]"
"MRS KIM: What are you doing here?"
"ZACH: Oh, uh..."
"MRS KIM: Lane is not here right now and anyway there are laws against stalking. You could go to jail."
"ZACH: No, I'm not stalking. I'm just looking for A...doorknob."
"MRS KIM: $75."
"ZACH: Wow. Could you throw in a door?"
"MRS KIM: Cash or credit?"
"ZACH: Actually, could I talk to you first?"
"MRS KIM: About what?"
"ZACH: I want to marry Lane."
"MRS KIM: I see."
"ZACH: I know Lane's your only daughter and I know how important she is to you, but I really love her. I mean, really love her. She's smart and hot [Mrs Kim looks at Zack] well, not hot. I don't mean hot, like, in a slutty way. She's beautiful and cool and an awesome drummer. Now I know you may have questions, and I totally get that, so I brought some stuff to answer them. First thing, I'm a good worker. That's a letter of recommendation from my manager at Quest Copying. Notice the part where he wrote, ""Zach's a good worker."" I didn't tell him to say that. He doesn't dig me that much personally, so you know he means it. I'm also in line for a promotion, assistant manager, which comes with medical benefits, so I can buy cheap medicine and get my teeth cleaned and stuff. That's my latest bank statement. It's not a lot, I know, but it grows a little every month well, except for maybe this month. The doorknob's gonna set me back a bit."
"MRS KIM: I thought you were a musician."
"ZACH: Well, yeah, I am."
"MRS KIM: And that is your true calling?"
"ZACH: Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm into drugs or looking to do the whole baby shambles thing. I just like to play."
"MRS KIM: You have a demo?"
"ZACH: Sure. But, I swear, the music never interferes with my day job, you can call my manager."
"MRS KIM: Bring it to me."
"ZACH: What?"
"MRS KIM: I need to know whether you can provide for Lane."
"ZACH: But I can. I showed you. I can."
"MRS KIM: As a musician! This is what you want to do with your life, yes?"
"ZACH: Yeah."
"MRS KIM: Then you will bring me your demo."
"ZACH: But what are you gonna do review it? Because rock it's very subjective."
"MRS KIM: I will evaluate it."
"ZACH: Evaluate it? And you haven't mentioned anything about marriage to Lane yet, right?"
"ZACH: Oh...no. I came to you first."
"MRS KIM: Good. Don't tell her. No need to get her hopes up in case this doesn't work out."
"ZACH: You don't think it's gonna work out?"
"MRS KIM: We take one step at a time."
"ZACH: [Sighs]"
"MRS KIM: You still want the doorknob?"
"ZACH: Not really."
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are cleaning]"
"RORY: Are you sure this whole thing isn't just an elaborate scheme to get me to help you clean your house?"
"LORELAI: Just throw away or hide anything that might be incriminating."
"RORY: Incriminating?"
"LORELAI: Yes anything that can, could, or might lead to a conversation about anything."
"RORY: How about this? Are you kidding me? A freckled, half-naked Lindsay Lohan on the cover of vanity fair? Uh, skin cancer, drug abuse, anorexia, bra shopping just dump it."
"RORY: You're hiding your flowers?"
"LORELAI: Yes, 'cause when people see flowers, they feel happy and welcome. It's important that my parents have as few positive associations about being here as possible."
"RORY: We could hit them over the head with mallets when they walk in the door."
"LORELAI: No, but I do have this incredibly bad-smelling perfume that Luke gave me for Christmas last year that I could spray around the house. It's like a cross between love's baby soft and curious by Britney Spears, with just a hint of Lysol thrown in."
"RORY: Delightful."
"LORELAI: Well, god bless him. He tries. [Doorbell rings, Lorelai goes and answers it]"
"SOOKIE: Food!"
"LORELAI: No, I'm Lorelai."
"SOOKIE: Heavy."
"LORELAI: That's just mean."
"SOOKIE: Falling."
"LORELAI: Right. [Takes some items] Follow me."
""
""
""
"[cut to the kitchen]"
"LORELAI: You are a lifesaver, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: I try. Okay, we've got mac and cheese. We've got Taquitos. We've got little biddy hot dogs…"
"LORELAI: Wait, Sookie, what is all this stuff?"
"SOOKIE: What? I made your favorites."
"LORELAI: But my parents aren't gonna eat any of this."
"SOOKIE: Your parents? I thought this was for you."
"LORELAI: You thought I wanted to sit by myself and eat an entire buffet of the world's most fattening food?"
"SOOKIE: I don't know I just figured it was just one of your cravings or maybe just a fun way to announce that you're pregnant."
"LORELAI: What?"
"SOOKIE: Well, you were saying something about being a sudden parent or expecting or being due soon. It's impossible to hear anything over that damn Cuisinart and all those gossiping busboys. So you're not pregnant?"
"LORELAI: No, I'm just expecting my parents over any minute."
"SOOKIE: Oh, yeah, that makes sense, too."
"LORELAI: That's okay. We'll make do. [Sookie looks at Lorelai funny] I'm not pregnant!"
"SOOKIE: Okay! Okay!"
"LORELAI: Now, the food..."
"SOOKIE: Right. Okay, the mini hot dogs can be bratwurst. The mac and cheese can be pasta La Sookie. And, presto, the Taquitos are Blinis."
"LORELAI: And the chili fries?"
"SOOKIE: Are chili fries."
"LORELAI: Right."
"RORY: Hey, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Hi, Rory. Blini?"
"RORY: Yes, please. [Sookie giggles] So, I cleared out all the magazines, newspapers, and most of the books and I hid away all the throw pillows and blankets and I lowered the heat to 55 to ensure minimal post-meal lingering."
"LORELAI: Yale-educated. I'll go do one final walk-through."
"SOOKIE: Last chance before I stash them."
"LORELAI: I'm not!"
"SOOKIE: Okay, okay."
"RORY: Grandma and grandpa's jag is here."
"LORELAI: What? [In a panic] I didn't hear them drive up. Did you?"
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Well, where the hell are they?"
"RORY: I don't know!"
"SOOKIE: Maybe they've been taken."
"LORELAI: Don't tease me."
"SOOKIE: Go! I'll finish setting up."
"[cut to outside]"
"RORY: The engine's cold."
"LORELAI: [Gasps] Maybe they have been taken!"
"EMILY: Hello, Lorelai, Rory."
"RORY: Hi, grandma."
"LORELAI: When did you get here?"
"EMILY: Oh, just a few minutes ago. You didn't tell me you were painting."
"LORELAI: I know. It's part of the remodel."
"EMILY: And is that the final color?"
"LORELAI: Yep."
"EMILY: Hum must be so nice not having to worry about a homeowner's association."
"RICHARD: There's a boat here."
"LORELAI: Dad!"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, Rory."
"RORY: Hi grandpa."
"RICHARD: When did you get a boat, Lorelai?"
"EMILY: Oh Richard, I've seen that boat. It's Luke's."
"RICHARD: Well, it doesn't look very seaworthy."
"LORELAI: It's a work in progress. It was his father's."
"RICHARD: Arr."
"EMILY: Luke keeps his dead father's boat locked away in your garage?"
"LORELAI: Mother."
"EMILY: What? I'm just saying, isn't that kind of morbid?"
"LORELAI: It's not like he's using it to hold his bones."
"RORY: You guys must be hungry. Let's head inside."
"EMILY: Well, well. I had no idea you'd had so much work done."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's nothing extensive, a nip here, a tuck there."
"EMILY: This room's been completely redone."
"LORELAI: A nip, nip, nip, tuck, tuck, tuck."
"EMILY: Apparently you haven't installed the heat yet. [Paul Anka runs in and jumps on a chair to get a snack] What's this?"
"RORY: That's Paul Anka."
"EMILY: You have a dog?"
"LORELAI: I just got him."
"EMILY: When?"
"LORELAI: Yesterday. Oh, well, fast learner, that one."
"EMILY: You should open an obedience school. You'd make a fortune."
"LORELAI: Oh, mom, dad, you remember Sookie."
"EMILY: Of course, hello, Sookie."
"RICHARD: Will you be joining us for dinner?"
"SOOKIE: Oh no, I'm just helping. The wainscoting here is substandard. If you had called me I could have recommended a real professional."
"LORELAI: Well since mine was a fake professional, I got to pay him in monopoly money."
"EMILY: Is that veneer? Tell me that's not veneer."
"LORELAI: So, Sookie, Tapas in the kitchen?"
"SOOKIE: Right this way."
"EMILY: You're still eating in the kitchen?"
"LORELAI: Yes we always eat in the kitchen. That's where the food is."
"RORY: Grandpa, could I offer you something to drink?"
"RICHARD: I suppose it's not too early for a scotch."
"RORY: And what about you, grandma? Grandma?"
"EMILY: Up here. Richard, come have a look."
"RICHARD: Where are you?"
"EMILY: In the bedroom."
"LORELAI: Three minutes gone, they're already in my bedroom."
"RORY: Impressive, by the way, with all the throw pillows, blankets, magazines, and books."
"LORELAI: Piled up on the bed?"
"RORY: Bathtub."
"LORELAI: That's gonna take some explaining."
"KIM HOUSE"
"[Zach comes in, Mrs Kim is listening to his demo tape.]"
"ZACH: Hey, Mrs. Kim. Still on the first song, huh?"
"MRS KIM: No, I've listened to the whole thing many times."
"ZACH: Yeah? And?"
"MRS KIM: Nothing catchy."
"ZACH: Nothing out of those songs?"
"MRS KIM: There are good bits here and there, and Lane can really pound the skins, but you need a hit."
"ZACH: But tons of great bands don't have hits."
"MRS KIM: I don't care about other bands. I care about your band, Lane's band. Don't you care about your band?"
"ZACH: I care a butt load."
"MRS KIM: Then write a hit."
"ZACH: Okay, not a problem. McCartney hasn't written a hit in 20 years, but I'll just sit down and crank one out."
"MRS KIM: You will if you want to marry Lane."
"ZACH: That's just not how it works."
"MRS KIM: I'll tell you how it works. You write a hit. You get a record contract. You write a hit. You get representation. You write a hit. You become husband. Can you do it? Can you write a hit?"
"ZACH: I don't know, maybe. I can try."
"MRS KIM: Don't try, do. 3 1/2 minutes, tops, and radio-friendly. [Zach leaves]"
"LORELAI AND LUKE'S HOUSE"
"[Kitchen Lorelai, Rory Emily and Richard are eating at the kitchen table]"
"RICHARD: This pasta La Sookie is very good, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: It's a big hit around the inn."
"RICHARD: There's something very familiar about it. I can't quite place it."
"EMILY: It's similar to the pasta La Fromage at De L'étoile'S."
"LORELAI: Ah, yes, De L'étoile'S sounds like my kind of guy."
"EMILY: [cell phone rings] What's that noise that keeps happening?"
"RORY: That's my cell phone, grandma. I'll turn it off."
"LORELAI: Or you can just take it in the other room, if you want."
"RORY: Nope, it's off. Pass the Blinis."
"EMILY: So, Lorelai, a new dog, a new bedroom, a new bathroom. It's like a whole new house."
"LORELAI: Except that it's the same house."
"EMILY: It doesn't look the same. It's lucky we had your address. We would have driven right by."
"LORELAI: Well, I was waiting till it was all done to show you."
"EMILY: All done? There's more that you're doing?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, the mailbox is crooked, and I was gonna plant a bush in the yard."
"EMILY: Forgive me. I had no idea such a stunning makeover was ahead of me. I feel terribly involved. [Knock on door, Lorelai get up to answer it.] Mom, come on. You were gonna be invited over. I just wanted to make sure everything was done and ready and that I could have you over when I could spend the maximum amount of time showing you around. [It's Luke, he starts to come in, turns and leaves, quietly to Luke] My parents are here. [To Emily] I was hoping to have a nice, little catered affair, you know, with guys in black coats carrying trays, 'cause I know how much you love guys in black coats carrying trays."
"EMILY: Who was at the door?"
"LORELAI: Oh, it was Ed McMahon. He's always showing up with these big cardboard checks. They are impossible to endorse, by the way."
"EMILY: I am never not sorry that I ask these questions. So I'm guessing all this means that you and Luke will be staying?"
"LORELAI: Staying?"
"EMILY: In Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: Mom, I've lived in Stars Hollow for 21 years."
"RICHARD: You can live somewhere your entire life and never truly feel at home, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Well, I do. I feel at home here, mostly 'cause it is my home and has been for 21 years."
"RICHARD: Yes, well..."
"EMILY: This house does have charm. It feels very homey. I can see you and Luke here."
"LORELAI: Wow. Thank you, mom."
"RORY: How about I make some coffee?"
"RICHARD: Thank you, Rory, but we'll have to take a rain check. Look at the time Emily."
"EMILY: Oh, goodness! I had no idea it was so late."
"LORELAI: Yes, who knew that 3 hours and 14 minutes could go by so fast? [Rory gives here a look] Well, I certainly didn't."
"[cut to the front door, Emily and Richard are already in there car.]"
"RORY: Drive safe."
"LORELAI: Bye-bye, now. [shuts the door]"
"RORY: Your parents are exhausting."
"LORELAI: Not as exhausting as your grandparents. [Sighs]"
"RORY: That was Luke at the door, wasn't it?"
"LORELAI: Yeah. Okay, second wind. Now, the early-bird dinner made immediate eating unnecessary, so I say we go straight to the movie and pick up a pizza on the way home."
"RORY: Perfect."
"LORELAI: Or perhaps we could get pizza on the way there and sneak it in, just in case."
"RORY: You in the market for some luggage?"
"LORELAI: What? Oh. That's for Luke. He's going on a trip, and his stupid duffel bag is in shreds."
"RORY: What trip?"
"LORELAI: He is going to chaperone April's field trip to Philadelphia."
"RORY: Really?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, he's really excited about it. But that excitement might end when he gets there and discovers that his underwear fell out somewhere around Amish country. The Amish however would be psyched, All right, what do we want a comedy, a tragedy, or a tragedy that makes us laugh?"
"RORY: Have you met her yet?"
"LORELAI: Met who?"
"RORY: April."
"LORELAI: Hum, not officially."
"RORY: What about her mom, what do you know about her?"
"LORELAI: Not much. Err Apparently, she's incredibly beautiful, she grew up here, she owns a store in Woodbridge, and Miss Patty thinks she was Mata Hari in a former life."
"RORY: What kind of store?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"RORY: Hmm, hey I have an idea, a really good idea."
"LORELAI: Ew, you have evil face."
"RORY: No, we should go to Woodbridge and go to her store."
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: Yeah. She won't know who we are. We could just go in there and see what she looks like."
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because I'm not spying on Luke's old girlfriend."
"RORY: You mean the mother of your fiancé's daughter."
"LORELAI: Whatever, it's weird and creepy."
"RORY: You're telling me you're not at all curious about the other woman?"
"LORELAI: She's not the other woman. She's another woman."
"RORY: Come on. Where's your adventurous spirit?"
"LORELAI: Hey, this is Luke's thing okay. He wants me to keep out of it for now, so I'm staying out of it, for now. Come on, troublemaker, put that evil mind to better use here."
"RORY: Fine. [looks at the paper] Last half of ""Nanny McPhee,"" first half of ""final destination 3."""
"LORELAI: Brilliant. Now, that is what a mind is for, my friend."
"STARS HOLLOW TOWN SQUARE"
"[Lorelai and Rory are walking through the town square]"
"LORELAI: I am sorry, but after you almost get k*ll on a plane and on the freeway, why would you choose to go on a crazy, terrifying roller coaster?"
"RORY: Oh boy."
"LORELAI: I mean, at that point, just stay home, right?"
"RORY: It's a horror movie."
"LORELAI: Yes but it doesn't make any sense."
"RORY: It's not supposed to. It's supposed to make you sick."
"LORELAI: Fine whatever. I'm heading to the inn. Do you want to come over and hang?"
"RORY: No, I got to run some errands. I'll meet you there later."
"LORELAI: All right, but watch out that a streetlight doesn't accidentally break off, swing down, and decapitate you."
"RORY: Will do."
"LORELAI: [sighs and starts to walk away, then returns] I mean, why even bother calling it ""final destination 3""? At that point, just call it ""now you're really, really, really dead."""
"RORY: [holds her hand up like a phone] Hello, Hollywood? Boy, have I got a picture for you."
"[They both walk away, Zach is writing his song strumming a Guitar on the steps of the gazebo. But is not doing very well.]"
"ANNA'S STORE"
"[Rory enters]"
"WOMAN: T-shirt or top?"
"ANNA: What do you need most?"
"WOMAN: Both."
"ANNA: Then go for broke, not literally, of course. We like our customers solvent. Keeps them coming back."
"WOMAN: [reading a t-shirt] ""Your boyfriend wants me""?"
"ANNA: What can I say? It's our biggest seller."
"WOMAN: Okay, I guess I'll try these on."
"ANNA: Dressing room's right through there, sweetie. Call if you need sizes."
"[Rory is looking at a few things]"
"ANNA: 1960s PAN AM stewardess bag."
"RORY: Oh. Really? A stewardess bag? Huh."
"ANNA: Yeah, I have the stewardess that goes with it, too, but it'll cost you."
"RORY: It's really cute, all of your stuff is really cute."
"ANNA: Thank you. I try to stock mostly one-of-a-kind things. I'm really into the whole ""this is mine, you can't have it"" scene. Must be only-child syndrome."
"RORY: Ah, yes, I know it well."
"ANNA: Okay, well, take your time."
"RORY: Okay."
"ANNA: Everything in that corner of the store smells like vanilla, freaky and unplanned. [Rory looks toward the corner with a weird face, then continues looking through the story]"
"ANNA: [To other customer while Rory looks on.] No."
"WOMAN: What?"
"ANNA: No."
"WOMAN: But…"
"ANNA: Trust me, at this moment, I am your best friend in the world."
"WOMAN: Should I just look…"
"ANNA: No."
"WOMAN: Okay, well…"
"ANNA: Not that, either. [Hands her so other clothes to try on]"
"DRAGONFLY INN – SITTING ROOM"
"KIRK: Look, Mrs. Kingston, Kirk will not rest until you are satisfied. Your demands are Kirk's demands. Your needs are Kirk's needs. Kirk is here for you."
"LORELAI: Um, Kirk?"
"KIRK: [Points to the wireless ear piece] Kirk appreciates that, Mrs. Kingston. We'll talk soon. [Ends the call]"
"LORELAI: What are you doing here?"
"KIRK: Trying to bag a whale. Kirk's in the real-estate game now."
"LORELAI: Stop doing that."
"KIRK: What?"
"LORELAI: Referring to yourself as ""Kirk."""
"KIRK: That's Kirk's thing. Every realtor needs a thing. This is Kirk's thing."
"LORELAI: You're a realtor?"
"KIRK: Trainee, technically."
"LORELAI: Well, Um, take your training somewhere else, okay? Your scaring away all my customers and my staff."
"KIRK: Unfortunately, there is nowhere else. Trainees don't get offices or salaries or jackets, actually. I'm supposed to be having this dry-cleaned for one of the senior brokers. It smells a little funky but fits like a dream. [Takes another phone call] You've got Kirk. Yes, Mrs. Zelnor. Right, the Dragonfly Inn. See you this afternoon."
"LORELAI: Wait, you're meeting clients here?"
"KIRK: Only a few."
"LORELAI: No."
"KIRK: I promise I'll be out of your hair as soon as I make my bones. I just need a temporary place to conduct my business and potentially have sex with prospective clients."
"LORELAI: What?"
"KIRK: That's Kirk's other thing, the young, virile eye candy angle for lonely widows and aging divorcées. Works like a charm. I plan on running it by Lulu, of course."
"LORELAI: Kirk, get out of here. Take your jacket and your dippy ""Star Trek"" device and your creepy new career and scram."
"KIRK: Fine, but I would have expected a little more cooperation from you, considering what I'm doing for your parents."
"LORELAI: What are you doing for my parents?"
"KIRK: sh**t, I should not have said that."
"LORELAI: Said what?"
"KIRK: Nothing. I can neither confirm nor deny that your parents are looking for a place in Stars Hollow."
"LORELAI: My parents are looking for a place in Stars Hollow?!"
"KIRK: I can't say. The realtor-trainee/client privilege is sacrosanct. The manual's very clear on that."
"LORELAI: How long have they been looking?"
"KIRK: I've already said too much. It isn't even my account. The entire firm is working on it."
"LORELAI: How long, Kirk?"
"KIRK: All I know is they're looking, they're pricing, they've seen three gracious single-family Tudors this week, and they have a 2:00 P.M. Showing tomorrow at 546 Oak Ridge Lane. But I cannot and will not violate their confidence."
"LORELAI: This cannot be happening."
"KIRK: Kirk here. Well, hello, Miss Wyatt. Lovely to hear your voice. Have I got a duplex for you. [Kirk leaves]"
"DRAGONFLY INN – LIBRARY"
"[Rory enters with coffee]"
"RORY: I am getting three hot dogs tonight, and I'll tell you why. I have ""Bugsy Malone"" running through my head, especially the scene where Scott Baio buys Florrie Dugger a hot dog and he offers her mustard with onions or ketchup without. So I started thinking, ""what would I like -- mustard with onions or ketchup without?"" And then, suddenly, they both started to sound really good. But I usually get my hot dogs with ketchup and relish. And you don't just walk out on something that has served you so well for so long. So three hot dogs it is. So what do you think happened to Florrie Dugger, anyway?"
"LORELAI: Oh, she moved to Stars Hollow, and her mother harped on her hairstyle so much, she jumped off a bridge."
"RORY: What?"
"LORELAI: The Gilmore's are moving in."
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: Kirk was in here today."
"KIRK: Nothing good starts with, ""Kirk was in here today."""
"LORELAI: And he's trying to be a realtor and he told me that he's been taking my parents around to look at houses."
"RORY: Around here?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"RORY: But why?"
"LORELAI: Why?! Because Luke and I are getting married, and I guess they figure we'll be having kids, and they want to be near me when that happens, really near, like in the room wearing Bill Blass scrubs."
"RORY: Oh, boy."
"LORELAI: I don't know what to do. I moved 30 miles away from my parents for a reason. Those 30 miles act as buffer so that when my mother says something that makes me want to k*ll her, I have to drive 30 miles to do it. 10 miles in, I usually calm down or I get hungry or I pass a mall, something prevents me from actually k*ll her. That buffer is my mother's best friend. Take the buffer away and you got Nancy Grace camping out on miss patty's lawn for a month."
"RORY: Okay, you need to get a grip. Maybe Kirk is wrong."
"LORELAI: Maybe."
"RORY: Well, don't think about it. Here, let me distract you with a present."
"LORELAI: For me?"
"RORY: For you."
"LORELAI: Well, the world stops for a present."
"RORY: Mm-hmm."
"LORELAI: Oh, it's so cute. I love it!"
"RORY: Good. You want to know where I got it?"
"LORELAI: Where did you get it?"
"RORY: At Anna Nardini's store."
"LORELAI: What? It was great. I just strolled right in, looked very casual. I didn't have to pretend like I needed help or anything. She just came right up to me."
"LORELAI: I told you I didn't want to go there."
"RORY: Well, you didn't. I did."
"LORELAI: I didn't want you to go there, either."
"RORY: What's the big deal? She didn't know who I was."
"LORELAI: The big deal is Luke asked me to stay out of this. He told me that he would deal with it."
"RORY: But you're his fiancée."
"LORELAI: Yeah and you should be able to trust your fiancée."
"RORY: Oh, right, the way he trusted you when he found out about April?"
"LORELAI: Hey!"
"RORY: Okay, I'm sorry. I just think it's crazy that you don't want to know anything about this woman."
"LORELAI: Rory, this conversation is over."
"RORY: So you're not at all curious about her?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: So you don't want to know what she looks like?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RORY: I'm sorry, you seriously don't care whether she's pretty or not?"
"LORELAI: No!"
"RORY: So you have no interest in the fact that she has good taste in clothes or music or…"
"LORELAI: Rory, stop! Drop it! I mean it!"
"RORY: Fine. I guess you don't want the purse then."
"MRS KIM'S GARAGE"
"ZACH: [Zack is singing]"
"What's the big commotion?"
"What's the big commotion?"
"Got ahead of distortion tell me before the kettle blows you know we got another commotion [Stops singing] so?"
"MRS KIM: Close."
"ZACH: [growns]"
"MRS KIM: Last part needs work."
"ZACH: Well, I don't know what else to do."
"MRS KIM: What you do is try again. I've been working on this song for 20 hours. My fingers are cramping. I'm totally fried."
"MRS KIM: Run in place for a minute. Gets the blood moving."
"ZACH: Forget it. This is hopeless."
"MRS KIM: What?"
"ZACH: I can't write a hit, okay?"
"MRS KIM: Not with that attitude you can't. Now, pick up your guitar. [He does.] Let me hear the last line of the chorus again."
"ZACH: [Singing] Tell me before the kettle blows you know we got another commotion"
"MRS KIM: stinks."
"ZACH: Great."
"MRS KIM: Try going out on a minor chord."
"ZACH: A minor chord, like this one."
"MRS KIM: Different minor chord. [plays it] Not quite."
"ZACH: How's this one?"
"MRS KIM: Better."
"ZACH: Yeah. That is better. Very Ray Davies."
"MRS KIM: I was thinking Dave Clark Five. Now try it again, the whole chorus."
"ZACH: [Singing]"
"What's the big commotion?"
"What's the big commotion?"
"Got ahead of distortion tell me before the kettle blows you know we got another commotion."
"[Finishes Singing] whoa."
"MRS KIM: Now, that is a hit song."
"ZACH: It is. We wrote a hit song. Mrs. Kim, we wrote a hit song!"
"MRS KIM: Excellent. Now we go inside."
"ZACH: You know, I try to write with Brian all the time, but it doesn't work out 'cause he gives in way too easy, you know? He just doesn't push me. I got a couple more songs I'd love for you to listen to. Maybe I can bring them by later?"
"MRS KIM: Lane, come down here now. Zach has something important to say to you."
"LANE: Yes, Zach?"
"ZACH: Your mom and I just wrote a hit song."
"LANE: What?"
"ZACH: It was incredible. We were in the garage. It was awesome. It goes out on a minor chord."
"MRS KIM: Zach!"
"ZACH: Yeah?"
"MRS KIM: Don't you have something else to say to Lane? [Puts down a small step between them] Maybe something to ask her?"
"ZACH: Oh, right. Sorry, uh... Lane? Lane, will you marry me?"
"LANE: Yes, Zach, I will."
"MRS KIM: Hold on. [Gets something from her pocket] This ring belonged to my grandmother. Now it belongs to you."
"LANE: Thanks, mama."
"MRS KIM: That one you keep in drawer so it doesn't scare the children. All right, you two are now officially engaged. There is much for you to discuss, so I will leave you two alone. You have 15 minutes."
"ZACH: I can't believe it. We did it."
"LANE: I know. We're getting married. [They kiss.] Now tell me about this song."
"ZACH: Lane, you're not gonna believe it. Think early Kinks meets the Jam meets the Futureheads. Here, I'll play it. [singing] What's the big commotion?"
"THE DINER – NIGHT TIME"
"[Lorelai and Rory enter]"
"LORELAI: Okay, but, see, I'm sorry. They did not even come up with a villain. No Freddy, no Jason. The villain is death? How lame is that? Who is seeing this movie?"
"RORY: Apparently we are, many, many times."
"LORELAI: But how can they make money off of that? I mean, where's the Halloween mask? Where's the costume? How can they keep making the same stupid movie over and over and over?"
"RORY: Ah, Caesar, thank god. We desperately need something to put in her mouth."
"LORELAI: Hi, two cheeseburgers and a copy of Sid Fields' book, please. We are missing the boat. Where's Luke?"
"CAESAR: He just ran upstairs. He's got this new policy of not yelling at the vendors in front of customers."
"[Rory's cell phone rings, Lorelai and Rory look at each other.]"
"RORY: So, what should we do after dinner?"
"LORELAI: Do you want to rent ""Final Destination"" 1 and 2?"
"RORY: So many things wrong with you."
"CAESAR: Here, freshly made."
"RORY: Excellent."
"LORELAI: Hey, what kind of donuts do you have left over?"
"CAESAR: I think we have chocolate, one jelly, and a crumb."
"LORELAI: Mmm, jelly, please."
"CAESAR: Okay."
"LORELAI: Hey, fancy new bag you got there."
"CAESAR: Huh? Oh, that's Luke's. I Think he just got it today. [Hands Lorelai the donut] I'll go check on your burgers."
"LORELAI: So, I finally wore him down, huh? [Rory looks at Lorelai} What?"
"RORY: Well, I don't know if you want to know this, but I saw that bag earlier at Anna's store."
"LORELAI: Huh, that bag?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"LORELAI: How do you know it was the same exact bag? There must be millions of places who sell it."
"RORY: I guess. I mean Anna did say that she likes to stock one-of-a-kind things. It's possible."
"LORELAI: Hmm. Excuse me."
"[cut to the apartment]"
"LUKE: I ordered Swiss, Monty. Swiss has holes. It's a terrific way to identify it. Okay, Thursday's good, but tomorrow would be even better. Okay, let me put it to you like this. If it comes on Thursday, it's half price, right? I will see you tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Hey. Am I interrupting?"
"LUKE: No, I was straightening something out. How was the movie?"
"LORELAI: Ugh, do not get me started. Rory's downstairs."
"LUKE: Great. I'll be right down."
"LORELAI: Cool. That's cool."
"LUKE: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Sure. Great. So, I see papa's got a brand-new bag."
"LUKE: Huh?"
"LORELAI: I saw your snazzy, new luggage downstairs."
"LUKE: Oh, right. Anna sent that over."
"LORELAI: Oh, wow, Coinkidink, huh?"
"LUKE: Well, we were talking about April's trip itinerary, and I guess I mentioned that my duffel bag's falling apart. And next thing I know, she sent the thing over."
"LORELAI: Oh, that's nice."
"LUKE: Sure, it's fine."
"LORELAI: You know, I was serious when I said I would go out and buy you new luggage. I'm nothing if not a gifted shopper."
"LUKE: Oh, I know that. But it's here, so..."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's here."
"LUKE: So this doesn't bother you, does it?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: That Anna sent me the bag? Because I can send it back."
"LORELAI: Oh, no, no. It's cool."
"LUKE: You sure?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'm fine. So, I should get back down."
"LUKE: Okay, I'll be by in a minute."
"LORELAI: Cool."
"[Cut back to the diner]"
"RORY: Well?"
"LORELAI: ""Well"" what?"
"RORY: Is the bag from Anna?"
"LORELAI: Yes, it is."
"RORY: It is?"
"LORELAI: It is. He mentioned his duffel bag was sh*t, and she sent a bag over. He didn't ask for it. He explained the whole thing to me. We discussed it, and we're fine."
"RORY: You're fine."
"LORELAI: Yep, I'm fine."
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory enters]"
"LOGAN: Where the hell you been?"
"RORY: Oh, I went to Stars Hollow to visit my mom for a couple days."
"LOGAN: You went to Stars Hollow?"
"RORY: Yep."
"LOGAN: Well, you could have told me, ace. Left a note, called, something."
"RORY: Yeah, I know, I should have."
"LOGAN: I mean, I wake up, and you're gone."
"RORY: I didn't mean to freak you out."
"LOGAN: I kept calling your cell. I must have called it a hundred times."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, well, my cell died, and my charger was here, of course. I have to buy an extra one. You keep telling me that."
"LOGAN: Finally, I checked in with the paper. They told me you've been e-mailing stuff. So at least I knew you were alive."
"RORY: I'm so sorry. It just became this whole thing. My grandparents stopped by unexpectedly, which took forever. And, anyhow, it's a long story. But I promise it'll never happen again. I have to take a shower."
"LOGAN: Rory."
"RORY: Yeah?"
"LOGAN: You sure everything's okay?"
"RORY: Yeah, it's fine."

"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory answers her cell phone]"
"RORY: Hey, you."
"[Lorelai is on the bed in the house]"
"LORELAI: Okay, so weird dream. Weird, weird dream."
"RORY: Weirder than the one where you step into a boxing ring and your hands are suddenly giant cream puffs?"
"LORELAI: Weirder, scarier."
"RORY: Let's hear it."
"LORELAI: Well I was home, and I was finishing up my usual morning routine you know, coffee, shower. And then - picture this, very weird - I take Paul Anka for a walk."
"RORY: You walk Paul Anka every day. What's weird about that?"
"LORELAI: Not the dog Paul Anka. The real Paul Anka."
"RORY: Whoa."
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"RORY: Was he nice?"
"LORELAI: Very pleasant, natty dresser. Then suddenly, he sees something, a cat or something, and darts right into the middle of the street."
"RORY: The real Paul Anka?"
"LORELAI: The dog Paul Anka. So I call him and call him, but he completely ignores me and runs right into Doose's Market."
"RORY: You didn't train him well enough. Too much affection, not enough discipline."
"LORELAI: I go after him into Doose's, and apparently he's got a job there."
"RORY: The dog Paul Anka?"
"LORELAI: The real Paul Anka."
"PAUL ANKA: You picked yourself some beautiful cucumbers, Mrs. Clancey. You have the cucumber eye."
"LORELAI: So I run out of Doose's, and I'm approaching Luke's apartment, I guess to get help or something, and I'm walking to the door, and I open it, and there's Paul Anka in front of a microphone giving a little concert."
"RORY: The real Paul Anka."
"LORELAI: The dog Paul Anka."
"RORY: Couldn't have been happy, you interrupting his show like that."
"LORELAI: He didn't notice, so I go down to the diner, and there, lo and behold, is Paul Anka sitting on Babette's lap."
"RORY: Please don't tell me it was…"
"LORELAI: The real Paul Anka."
"BABETTE: [stroking Paul Anka] Good boy. Who's a good boy?"
"RORY: This is crazy."
"LORELAI: Coming to the end. So the real Paul Anka looks outside, and there, sitting in the middle of the street staring at him is dog Paul Anka."
"RORY: Uh Oh! So real Paul Anka gets up and runs out of Luke's. They're both in the street now, real Paul Anka walking toward dog Paul Anka, dog Paul Anka toward real Paul Anka. You can sense that something very bad is about to happen, when suddenly they meet in the middle of the street, and bam! An otherworldly white light engulfs the whole town, and there's a loud expl*si*n and two barks, and everything goes dark."
"RORY: And?"
"LORELAI: And then I woke up."
"RORY: Wow."
"LORELAI: Yeah"
"RORY: Okay."
"LORELAI: So I guess I was wondering if you'd heard anything about a small Connecticut town being sucked up into an evil demon vortex or cast into the fourth dimension or anything."
"RORY: Nope."
"LORELAI: Real Paul Anka still kicking?"
"RORY: Haven't heard otherwise. Check your hands"
"LORELAI: No cream puffs."
"RORY: I think you're good to start your day."
"LORELAI: Thanks, hon."
"RORY: Anytime."
"LORELAI: Bye. [Hangs up and looks at the dog Paul Anka]"
"OPENING CREDITS"
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Morning, busy, Luke and Caesar enter]"
"LUKE: You're gonna do fine."
"CAESAR: Says you."
"LUKE: And everybody else. You know the place backwards and forwards, Caesar."
"CAESAR: You've never been gone this long."
"LUKE: You're gonna do fine."
"CAESAR: Stop saying that. It's bad luck."
"LUKE: Well then you're gonna stink. You're gonna blow up the stove and give everybody salmonella."
"CAESAR: Why do you say that?"
"LUKE: Because if it's bad luck to say good things, it's good luck to say bad things."
"CAESAR: You're rooting for me to fail."
"LUKE: I am not rooting for me to fail, Lorelai, tell him he's gonna do great."
"LORELAI: And jinx it for him? No way."
"CAESAR: Thank you."
"LUKE: You're both nuts."
"KIRK: I could run the place if you want, Luke."
"LUKE: Hmm, let me search down to the very depth of my being to see if there's the slightest inclination I would want that. Nope."
"KIRK: Just checking."
"LUKE: What's that?"
"LORELAI: Oh I bought it over last night I figured you'd need it for hanging stuff."
"LUKE: I'm not bringing hanging stuff."
"LORELAI: Well, you should bring some nice clothes just in case. I threw in some slacks and your black jacket."
"LUKE: It's a field trip with a bunch of 12-year-olds. I'm not gonna need nicer stuff."
"LORELAI: Just in case."
"LUKE: It's 10 days of diners and fast food, nothing requiring slacks or jackets."
"LORELAI: See, that's what the phrase ""just in case"" covers, the times you think you've anticipated every possible need."
"LUKE: Alright, I'll bring it."
"CAESAR: You know, there was a flash flood in El Salvador last night."
"LUKE: No, my Salvadoran paper didn't come today."
"CAESAR: They didn't see it coming."
"LUKE: That's the flash part of flash flood."
"CAESAR: So what do I do if I see a flash flood coming strait at the diner?"
"LUKE: Make sure all the customers have settled up."
"CAESAR: It's all a big joke to you."
"LORELAI: So you're taking this, huh? [Pointing at the Anna bag]"
"LUKE: The old one's a mess."
"LORELAI: Hmm."
"LUKE: You don't think I should?"
"LORELAI: No, it's just you think it's sturdy enough?"
"LUKE: Yeah, I think it should be."
"LORELAI: Well, it's always best to take something that a gorilla could jump up and down on and not wreck."
"LUKE: I don't think a gorilla has tested it, but if it busts, I'll just pick up something on the road."
"LORELAI: That will work."
"LUKE: All right, I should get going. Anna's stuck at the house until I pick up April."
"LORELAI: Well, let's get you on the road."
"LUKE: It's good timing, too. Caesar's in the back."
"KIRK: Sure you don't want to reconsider my offer? I've got a hairnet on me, so I can start immediately."
"LUKE: Offer declined."
"LORELAI: You take that. I'll take this. [Pointing at the Anna bag]"
"LUKE: Perfect. [Luke picks up the hanging bag]"
"LORELAI: [Lorelai is swinging the bad] Oh. Oops. [It hits the edge of the door.]"
"CAESAR: Woo hold up, wait! Wait!"
"LUKE: He's unstoppable."
"LORELAI: It's cute."
"CAESAR: We need to confirm the itinerary."
"LUKE: As we've done 1,000 times? Sure, let's confirm it."
"CAESAR: Today's the kids' math contest in Newark. In my day, you learned two plus two and you stayed home. Today they go on the road like they're Metallica."
"LUKE: And then tomorrow night's Philadelphia. [Turning to Lorelai] Did I tell you we're dropping in on Jess?"
"LORELAI: Jess? No."
"LUKE: Yeah, this place he works. They put out this Zine and books and whatever else. They're having an open house. I'm taking April. It'll give jess a chance to meet his little cousin."
"LORELAI: [Sounding taken back] Oh, sounds great. So anywhere in the back?"
"LUKE: Anywhere's fine. [Lorelai throws the bag in the truck, Luke gives a weird look.]"
"CAESAR: Hey, day six, if your cell dies, is there a phone in Gettysburg I could reach you at?"
"LUKE: Yeah the one grant used to call Lincoln -- number's in the book."
"CAESAR: Oh, good. He's a funnyman today. He's Jerry Lewis."
"LORELAI: Caesar, calm down. You're gonna do great. You're the best cook Luke's ever had. You so make better pancakes than he does."
"CAESAR: True."
"LUKE: No he doesn't"
"LORELAI: You just have to be confident."
"CAESAR: It just when I'm working the grill, sometimes I get a locked elbow. And Luke's the only one who knows how to rub it to get it working."
"LORELAI: He rubs your elbow?"
"LUKE: It's like a sports injury. It's okay if it's sports. You want to step back about 3 feet so I can say goodbye to my girl?"
"CAESAR: Fine."
"LUKE: You gonna miss me?"
"LORELAI: Especially if my elbow hurts."
"LUKE: I'm gonna call you a lot."
"LORELAI: Same here."
"LUKE: You know, I was happy when she asked me, but now it just struck me I'm gonna spend 10 days with a bus full of teenagers."
"LORELAI: I think you're ready. [They kiss]"
"LUKE: Thanks for seeing me off."
"LORELAI: Your pancakes are better, by the way."
"LUKE: Thanks."
"CAESAR: Don't worry, Luke. Just a momentary panic. I'm gonna be fine, I promise."
"LUKE: Good. Now go back in there and reclaim your turf."
"CAESAR: Reclaim my turf?"
"KIRK: [Kirk is serving coffee and wearing the hair net.] My name is Kirk, I run the place."
"CAESAR: Kirk! [Caesar runs inside, Luke and Lorelai share a final wave Luke gets in the truck.] What are you doing Kirk, you don't work here. [The struggle, Lorelai watches on.]"
"KIRK: That's my favorite hair net! [Kirk chases Caesar through the diner.]"
"CAR PARK"
"[People are getting ready to leave on the bus]"
"LUKE: I'm bad with names, so help me with the names."
"APRIL: You ever use mnemonic devices?"
"LUKE: Uh, maybe."
"APRIL: They help you remember things. Uh, like Curtis Shuran. He's from Kurdistan."
"LUKE: Really?"
"APRIL: No, he's from Detroit. That's a mnemonic device."
"LUKE: Curtis Shuran from Kurdistan. Got it."
"APRIL: Jamie Alvarado likes to try avocados. Meg Shatsworth, Haywood's Fatsworth."
"LUKE: Shatsworth, Fatworth. Alvarado, avocado."
"APRIL: And those are your fellow Grups."
"LUKE: The what?"
"APRIL: Grown-ups. You never saw the original ""star trek""?"
"LUKE: Oh, yes, Grups. Yes, I did."
"APRIL: The one in the cords is our math teacher, Mr. Munster. Good guy, he's a little nerdy, likes to wow us with his Chris Rock impersonation. It's borderline r*cist."
"LUKE: Well, let's leave the bags here, get the lay of the land first."
"APRIL: Well, this is pretty much the land."
"LUKE: There must be some kind of check-in point and protocol to follow, so just stick with me. Or you just run on the bus. That's really good."
"EARL: Hello, there. You our pilot?"
"LUKE: Your what?"
"KELLY: Are you the driver?"
"LUKE: Me? No. I'm Luke Danes."
"EARL: Oh, you're Luke Danes. Sorry. We thought you were our driver."
"LUKE: No, no, sorry. I, uh, you know, I have nicer clothes than this. I won't always be wearing these."
"EARL: That's okay. I'm Earl Stepton. This is Kelly Turlington. You probably know Roy Munster, your daughter's teacher."
"LUKE: Actually, no. I'm April's new father, I mean, not new, but new to her. So, hey."
"ROY: She's a bright one."
"LUKE: Go figure. [They all laugh]"
"APRIL: [From the Bus window] Hey, Luke! Some people in here are wondering who you are."
"LUKE: Oh, well, go ahead and tell them."
"APRIL: That's Luke."
"KELLY: So here's the detailed itinerary."
"EARL: Lunch stops, snack stops."
"ROY: Wander time, exploring time."
"KELLY: TV time."
"EARL: p*rn will be preblocked at all our lodgings."
"LUKE: Okay so no p*rn."
"ROY: Study breaks, check-in with parents."
"KELLY: Bedtime hours."
"LUKE: So we go to bed at 9:00?"
"EARL: The kids do. You don't have to."
"LUKE: Right, but I can?"
"EARL: Sure."
"LUKE: Okay great."
"ROY: Shall we get on board so they don't leave without us?"
"LUKE: Well, I still have my bags."
"KELLY: Okay, see you on the bus."
"LUKE: Kelly Turlington from Burlington. Arr Roy Munster's a punster."
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"LORELAI: Hey, you."
"RORY: Hey."
"LOGAN: You get in late last night?"
"RORY: I was studying."
"LOGAN: Hmm. Missed my class this morning."
"RORY: Bummer."
"LOGAN: Clock didn't go off. I thought I set it right."
"RORY: Oh, I reset it. I had to catch up on some sleep. I didn't know you set it for early."
"LOGAN: Honest mistake."
"RORY: Maybe we should get a second clock."
"LOGAN: Might be wise. You gonna be available to grab a bite later?"
"RORY: Maybe."
"LOGAN: You can't see that far into the future?"
"RORY: It's crazy right now."
"LOGAN: I'll check in with you later."
"RORY: We'll see how it goes. [Logan grabs Rory's arm to pull her in close for a kiss]"
"LOGAN: Have a good day."
"RORY: You too. [Rory leaves]"
"SCHOOL BUS"
"[The kids are singing the elements song, Luke is looking out-of-place]"
"KIDS: There's holmium and helium and hafnium and erbium and phosphorous and francium and fluorine and terbium and manganese and mercury, molybdenum, magnesium dysprosium and scandium and cerium and cesium and lead, praseodymium, platinum, plutonium palladium, promethium, potassium, polonium and tantalum, technetium, titanium, tellurium [Inhale deeply] And cadmium and calcium and chromium and curium there's sulfur, californium and fermium, berkelium and also mendelevium, einsteinium, nobelium and argon, krypton, neon radon, xenon, zinc, and rhodium and chlorine, carbon, cobalt copper, tungsten, tin, and sodium these are the only ones of which the news has come to Harvard and there may be many others but they haven't been discovered. [the applaud them selves]"
"LUKE: What was all that?"
"APRIL: It's all the chemical elements. At least the ones that have come to Harvard."
"BOY: [OS] 1468..."
"LUKE: Any idea what's going on here?"
"BOY:...14201995611..."
"APRIL: That's frank."
"MARCIA: Huge show-off."
"APRIL: Always rubbing our faces in the fact that he knows the first 300 digits of pi."
"LUKE: Of course"
"APRIL: [To Marcia] Hey, did you bring my sweater?"
"MARCIA: I think so."
"APRIL: It's important. I need that sweater."
"FREDDIE: What is it, your lucky sweater?"
"APRIL: No, Freddie."
"MARCIA: Is Munster gonna wear that creepy lucky tie of his at competition?"
"SUE: Oh, god, I hope not."
"MARCIA: Supposedly, there's lucky underwear to match."
"APRIL: Mental image, be gone."
"MARCIA: I heard he lives with his mother."
"SUE: I heard he plays the trombone for fun."
"FREDDIE: He's a liar, too, he says he was a red sox fan, but he didn't even know they traded Damon."
"LUKE: Really? He didn't know Damon was with the Yankees now?"
"FREDDIE: No."
"LUKE: You see Steinbrenner made him cut his hair?"
"FREDDIE: Yeah, he looks way less scary."
"LUKE: Yeah, less intimidating to pitchers. It's gonna shave 20 points off his batting average. Hey, what's that kid's name?"
"APRIL: Freddie. His name is Freddie."
"LUKE: Freddie, Freddie, apple-brown betty, nice kid."
"APRIL: Yeah, well, I should study."
"LUKE: You got it."
"DRAGONFLY INN"
"LORELAI: Mr. And Mrs. Moore, your horses are saddled and ready. Now, Cletus is very gentle, but they're both sweethearts. Rob is outside to help you get started."
"MRS MOORE: Thank you."
"LORELAI: Okay, have fun. Mrs. Kim, hi."
"MRS KIM: You let women ride horses?"
"LORELAI: Yes."
"MRS KIM: [Sighs] I have a request."
"LORELAI: Alright"
"MRS KIM: This is a wedding dress. It's the dress I wore when I married Mr. Kim 28 years ago."
"LORELAI: Hmm, khaki with a big zipper down the middle. Fashion is a fluctuating thing, huh? Oh, oh, the dress is inside."
"MRS KIM: Right. I would like Lane to wear it at her wedding."
"LORELAI: Well how nice."
"MRS KIM: But it's a tad big. Lane is smaller than me. It might need a hem, and the sleeves should be shortened."
"LORELAI: Makes sense."
"MRS KIM: I would like you to alter it for Lane."
"LORELAI: Well, of course. I would love to."
"MRS KIM: Lane would like that, too."
"LORELAI: Anything for her."
"MRS KIM: Alterations should be minor. Take it in a little here and there, and that should do it."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll give lane a call and bring her in for a fitting."
"MRS KIM: Not necessary, here's her height and arm length -- that's all you need."
"LORELAI: I'll get right on it."
"MRS KIM: Thank you. Do they at least ride sidesaddle, the women?"
"LORELAI: Yes, every single one of them."
"MRS KIM: Good. [she leaves, Lorelai looks at the dress and gasps]"
"YALE NEWS ROOM"
"RORY: Uh, Paris, what's going on here? [Looking at a jar on the desk]"
"PARIS: I just need 10 more minutes. I took a delete-boring-answers pass on my interview with professor Whittington and ended up with a tidy 16-word piece. His wife must want to suck a tail pipe every night. I'm putting stuff back in now."
"RORY: I meant with the big jar of disgusting insects. Oh. They're fruit flies. I'm finishing an important paper on population genetics, and I have to monitor how often Drosophila Melanogaster do the nasty."
"RORY: Gross."
"PARIS: Complain to god, not me."
"RORY: Well did you have to bring them into the newsroom?"
"PARIS: I can't just leave them home. They could escape and infest my apartment."
"RORY: Meaning they could escape and infest the newsroom."
"PARIS: At least no one sleeps in the newsroom, and if they bring food and flies get in the food, they'll learn to follow the ""no food in the newsroom"" rule."
"RORY: We don't have that rule."
"PARIS: We should."
"RORY: Get them out of here."
"PARIS: I need 9 minutes."
"RORY: Paris."
"PARIS: 8 1/2. Come on you want the interview, I got to keep typing."
"RORY: Okay, 9 minutes."
"PARIS: Thanks."
"LOGAN: Hey, chief, got a minute?"
"RORY: Um, a minute."
"LOGAN: I'm a little confused about something."
"RORY: How can I help."
"LOGAN: I was working on the piece about textbook prices. You assigned it to me a couple of weeks ago."
"RORY: Ua-hu"
"LOGAN: It wasn't gonna earn me my Pulitzer, but I already put a lot of work into it, and I just checked the server and noticed that a piece on the same topic's been written."
"RORY: Yes, it has been."
"LOGAN: Our wires get crossed?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LOGAN: Who wrote it?"
"RORY: I did."
"LOGAN: Why?"
"RORY: It's topical. It affects every student. It's an important story I wanted to be sure that it would get done."
"LOGAN: It wasn't due for two more days."
"RORY: I didn't think you'd meet the deadline."
"LOGAN: Based on what?"
"RORY: Based on past performance."
"LOGAN: Past performance is no indication of future performance."
"RORY: Wise men call that a sucker's maxim."
"LOGAN: I did a lot of research on this thing, I interviewed textbook publishers, I interviewed authors. I was gonna get more quotes from students."
"RORY: I know. I used your research. A lot of it came in handy."
"LOGAN: Really."
"RORY: The stuff that I could make sense out of."
"LOGAN: Good."
"RORY: Look, you'll get your by-line, if that's what this is about."
"LOGAN: You know that's not what this is about."
"RORY: I thought I was doing you a favor."
"LOGAN: Everyone knew I was assigned that piece, and now they know it's been taken away from me."
"RORY: Logan, I'm sorry. It's as you said. Our wires got crossed. It happens. Let's move on."
"LOGAN: Okay, we'll move on. [Picks up Paris's jar] And what's with this?"
"PARIS: Keep walking, whitey."
"LOGAN: You let fruit flies in the newsroom?"
"PARIS: It's not hurting anybody."
"LOGAN: It's disgusting."
"PARIS: I just need five more minutes."
"RORY: Don't rush, Paris. [To Logan] The fruit flies are not hurting anybody, and Paris is working on something that I'm waiting on. I would prefer it if she weren't interrupted."
"LOGAN: [Looking at Rory and sounding a little mad] Sorry, Paris."
"SNACK AND SODA – DINNER"
"LUKE: Alright guys, just remind me, who's allergic to dairy? [He answer] There you go. No mayo. Who's allergic to wheat? [She answer] There you go, Tori, bound for glory. And who's low sodium? [He answer] There you go, apple-brown betty Freddie, no salt."
"[Luke goes and sits at a table with April, Sue and Marcia]"
"APRIL: Uh, hey."
"LUKE: Hey. You know, I'm still mad about that math competition."
"APRIL: Arr, you win some you loose some."
"LUKE: Those buzzers in the countdown round were rigged. I know they were. The judges were on the take."
"APRIL: He's called a moderator, actually."
"LUKE: Yeah, well, whatever they are. I'm lodging a protest."
"APRIL: Luke, could we talk for a sec?"
"LUKE: Sure."
"[They get up and move]"
"LUKE: What's up?"
"APRIL: You know Freddie, right?"
"LUKE: Yeah, good kid."
"APRIL: Well, I-I like him."
"LUKE: Oh, well, I like him, too. He seems less insane than the others."
"APRIL: I don't mean like him the way you like him, I hope."
"LUKE: You've known him longer."
"APRIL: And I'm a girl."
"LUKE: I know that."
"APRIL: And he's a boy."
"LUKE: I know that, too. [April looks at Luke] Oh! You like him."
"APRIL: Shh!"
"LUKE: Sorry"
"APRIL: I'm not quite ready to proclaim it to the world yet."
"LUKE: Are you old enough to like a boy?"
"APRIL: I'm not sure."
"LUKE: I'll have to look it up in a book to see whether you're supposed to like boys yet or not."
"APRIL: It's a fact either which way."
"LUKE: Okay, so what do you want me to do?"
"APRIL: For starters, it would help if you stopped calling him Betty."
"LUKE: [Laughing a little] Right."
"APRIL: And you sitting next to me all the time is kind of getting in the way."
"LUKE: Oh, jeez, I didn't realize."
"APRIL: I know you're pretty oblivious."
"LUKE: It seems like Freddie is…"
"APRIL: Don't look at him!"
"LUKE: Sorry. It just seems like you pay less attention to Freddie than any of the other boys."
"APRIL: That's because I like him."
"LUKE: You like him, so you ignore him?"
"APRIL: That's the way it works."
"LUKE: But you're always palling around with Kevin."
"APRIL: Kevin makes me sick."
"LUKE: I'm confused."
"APRIL: You're over thinking this."
"LUKE: I must be."
"APRIL: Don't look at him!"
"LUKE: I'm sorry. [Sighs] I-I, shouldn't be sitting next to you, then, huh?"
"APRIL: Maybe not."
"LUKE: Guess I'll go sit with the parents."
"APRIL: I think that's a good idea."
"LUKE: Okay. Well, you want to go back together, or should we stagger it a little?"
"APRIL: Give me a four-second head start."
"LUKE: You got it. [April leaves, Luke sighs a short while later]"
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory comes home]"
"LOGAN: [OS] The bottle is dry."
"COLIN: [OS] You cannot be out of wild turkey."
"LOGAN: [OS] I've got everything else under the sun. Pick one and stop your nagging."
"COLIN: You cannot be out of wild turkey."
"LOGAN: No matter how many times you tell me I'm not out doesn't change the fact that I'm out."
"FINN: Hands."
"ROBERT: Jerk."
"RORY: Hi, everyone."
"Hey, Rory. Get yourself a drink. Anything but wild turkey."
"RORY: I'm okay."
"LOGAN: Yeah forget it. She doesn't drink on school nights."
"RORY: I sometimes do."
"COLIN: I'm getting a sense that the woman of the house had no idea we were going to be here."
"FINN: Okay that we're here, love?"
"LOGAN: Of course it's okay."
"FINN: Logan I haven't called you love since that sultry night in Bimini."
"RORY: It's fine that you're here. What's with the maps?"
"COLIN: Graduation is imminent, Rory. So we are planning the ultimate life and death brigade event."
"FINN: Not only the ultimate, but the penultimate."
"COLIN: Penultimate means next to last, Finn. This is the last one."
"FINN: I thought it meant super-ultimate."
"ROBERT: How did you get into Yale?"
"FINN: Slept with the recruiter."
"RORY: What's the stunt?"
"COLIN: We're flown on a twin-engine plane to a remote spot in Costa Rica. We don parachutes, base-jump off a cliff whose height is..."
"ROBERT: Exactly 3,624 feet, unless that's a 2."
"COLIN: We land on the banks of the San Juan river."
"FINN: Hopefully not in the river."
"ROBERT: Or on the Nicaraguan side of the river."
"LORELAI: Or in Panama"
"COLIN: We inflate a raft, white-water three miles down to a meeting point, where a blowout party will take place."
"ROBERT: It's a 2, gents. I'm pretty sure it's a 2...or an 8."
"RORY: Where do you get the inflatable raft?"
"LOGAN: One of us will parachute with it in our packs."
"FINN: Not me I've got the DVD player."
"COLIN: Not me I've got the champagne and the bong."
"ROBERT: If I take it, it'll crush the cigars."
"LOGAN: Stand down, boys. I'll jump with the raft."
"RORY: You're planning this all very carefully, right?"
"COLIN: Luckily we have a topographical-map expert in our midst."
"ROBERT: It's a 3. I'm 90% sure."
"RORY: Why don't you make extra sure you have the right number there Robert?"
"LOGAN: Hey, let the man do his thing."
"RORY: Well, I would if the man doing his thing weren't drunk and hadn't forgotten to put on his reading glasses."
"ROBERT: Oh, my god. I'm not wearing my glasses."
"COLIN: They flew off when you did that impression of the old guy getting sh*t by Dick Cheney."
"RORY: Who's flying this twin-engine airplane, and who's supplying the parachutes? I mean, there must be a weight limit to make that jump, right? Do you guys know what the weight limit is?"
"LOGAN: So you came home just to piss on the fun?"
"RORY: No, I came home because I live here."
"COLIN: You know, guys, maybe we should resume our planning another time."
"LOGAN: Yeah, I guess maybe we should."
"ROBERT: I'll never be able to refold these."
"COLIN: Just grab them and let's go, Robert."
"FINN: [Holding up his class] Okay if I return this another time?"
"LOGAN: Sure."
"RORY: Go with them if you want."
"LOGAN: Is it your life mission to embarrass me at every opportunity you get?"
"RORY: It's Robert, Colin, and Finn, Logan. I've seen them all dance naked with underwear on their heads. There's no embarrassing you in front of them."
"LOGAN: Well, you embarrassed me tonight."
"RORY: How, by pointing out that the stunt you're planning doesn't exactly sound safe?"
"LOGAN: It's called the Life and Death Brigade, Rory"
"RORY: Yeah, and you're supposed to try to avoid the death part."
"LOGAN: This is not your business, and why aren't you at the paper? You're always at the paper at this time of night."
"RORY: Finished early."
"LOGAN: How? You delegate a little let people actually write their own articles?"
"RORY: That's old news."
"LOGAN: It's not old news you knew that would embarrass me, and you didn't care."
"RORY: Please."
"LOGAN: Even when we're together, you're someplace else. You leave, and you don't kiss me goodbye. Were at dinner, you're on your cell phone the whole time. You never leave notes anymore about where you're gonna be. So I have no idea where you are. You haven't forgiven me"
"RORY: What are you talking about?"
"LORELAI: For the girls I was with when we were separated."
"RORY: I said I forgive you. Yeah, you said it, but you haven't, though. You haven't. I'll be at the pub. [Logan leaves]"
"OUTSIDE LUKE'S"
"[Lorelai is walking down the street]"
"LANE: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Hi, Lane."
"LANE: You're in possession."
"LORELAI: Of what?"
"LANE: Of the wedding dress."
"LORELAI: Oh, um, yeah. It's safe and sound. I was just starting to dig into it."
"LANE: Don't dig. Slice, k*ll, maim, destroy."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LANE: Sic a mad pack of wolves on it. Douse it with lighter fluid and turn it in to ash. I cannot wear that dress."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I know. It's a little old-world."
"LANE: Have you looked at it?"
"LORELAI: Parts of it."
"LANE: Exactly you can't take it in at once. The eyeball is not capable."
"LORELAI: Aw, It's not that bad."
"LANE: It's got pants."
"LORELAI: [Gasps] No!"
"LANE: You didn't look at it very carefully."
"LORELAI: Well, I will remove the pants."
"LANE: Oh, it's every girl's dream to hear the woman altering her wedding dress say, ""I'll remove the pants."""
"LORELAI: I'm sure once I alter it a little…"
"LANE: No, don't alter it. Have an accident. Leave a warm iron on it. Spill a vat of acid on it. Run your car over it."
"LORELAI: Lane, Lane, I haven't even put it on the mannequin yet. Now, let me start work on it, and I will keep you fully posted every step of the way and…[Lorelai see something in the reflection of the window] Oh my God!"
"LANE: What? My mom?"
"LORELAI: No, my mom and dad. I thought I saw something."
"LANE: Well, focus, focus. Important topic we're discussing here."
"LORELAI: All right, I got to run. I'll call you later."
"LANE: Lorelai! [Lorelai goes of to look for her parents]"
""
""
""
"[cut to a little bit up the street, Lorelai see Emily and Richard going about the corner.]"
"LANE: I'm not above bribing."
"LORELAI: Don't sneak up on me like that."
"LANE: [Waving some $10 notes] It's all about the Hamilton's, baby."
"LORELAI: You can't pay me to ruin your dress."
"LANE: Look forget about your parents and concentrate on this."
"LORELAI: Wait, so you saw them, too? I'm not insane?"
"LANE: They've been walking around town all morning."
"LORELAI: All morning. Any guess as to why?"
"LANE: Shred the dress, and I'll tell you."
"LORELAI: Do you really know why?"
"LANE: No."
"LORELAI: Well, then I'm not gonna ruin the dress."
"LANE: Well, I did see them talking to Kirk earlier."
"LORELAI: Kirk?"
"LANE: Yeah, and he was wearing his maroon jacket."
"LORELAI: His real-estate jacket. This is not good! This is not good!"
"LANE: My life is in your hands. I don't think you're fully comprehending that fact."
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"[Logan's is packing]"
"LORELAI: I guess I'm going."
"RORY: Okay."
"LOGAN: I'll be out of cell phone range for a couple days."
"RORY: I know."
"LOGAN: I'll see you. [He leaves]"
"OLD HOUSE"
"[Lorelai busts her way in though the damaged door, the house is a mess]"
"LORELAI: Kirk! Kirk!"
"KIRK: Mask!"
"LORELAI: What?"
"KIRK: Mask."
"LORELAI: What is this?"
"KIRK: I've done it, Lorelai. I finally landed my first listing."
"LORELAI: Where are my parents?"
"KIRK: This is the beginning of my rise to the top of the real-estate industry."
"LORELAI: Where are my parents?"
"KIRK: Do you happen to be in the market for a house? 'Cause this baby's a honey."
"LORELAI: Something in the corner just moved."
"KIRK: Just a rat. I'd have told you about them before you bought the place. The law also requires me to inform you that the house has toxic mold, asbestos, methane gas, buckling floors, a crumbling foundation, visible fungus, a collapsed fireplace, [a piece of the ceiling falls and just misses them] ceiling damage, water damage, and it was the recent site of a Wicca convention and a particularly grisly m*rder/su1c1de. nothing we can't work with."
"LORELAI: I'm not in the market. Now, listen, I know my parents are shopping for houses. Lane saw you with them and I need to know where they are right now."
"KIRK: I'm sorry. That's confidential information. In fact, the fact that I was with them was confidential. So I'm gonna have to ask you to pretend that I haven't already confirmed that I was with them, which I wasn't."
"LORELAI: [Fluttering] Oh, god, what was that?"
"KIRK: Bat. Don't worry. When you spray for cockroaches, the bats die, too, usually. At the very least, it knocks the wind out of them so they wind up wobbling on the floor, so you can just whack them with a hammer, nothing we can't work with."
"LORELAI: Kirk, I am your friend, but they are my parents, and I need to find them right now. It's important."
"KIRK: Well, I shouldn't tell you this, but I know they were looking at two properties on maple drive. They're probably around there right now. Too bad I couldn't get them interested in this property. It has great bones. Literally. There's an Indian burial ground underneath it."
"LORELAI: Thanks. See ya. [Lorelai leaves in a hurry]"
"KIRK: Don't run. It scares the bat."

"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: … what are you doing here? Hey, did we have something set up?"
"RICHARD: Uh, no."
"EMILY: No."
"RICHARD: No."
"LORELAI: No? Then what's up?"
"RICHARD: Oh Well, we're here to, um..."
"EMILY: Do a little antiquing."
"LORELAI: Antiquing"
"RICHARD: Right, antiquing."
"EMILY: We're hitting Litchfield, Woodbridge, Washington depot."
"LORELAI: Well, we have some great antique stores right here in little old stars hollow."
"RICHARD: That's what brings us."
"LORELAI: So you've been to Madison house?"
"EMILY: Where?"
"LORELAI: Madison house, Oh, amazing stuff, lots of colonial. It's not in my price range, but I love to browse around. I'll take you there right now."
"RICHARD: Oh, uh, I don't know if now is a good time."
"EMILY: Err we have an appointment to keep."
"LORELAI: An appointment huh, I thought you were just walking around shopping."
"EMILY: We are. We made an appointment at an appointments-only antique shop."
"LORELAI: We have those here?"
"RICHARD: Well obviously we do because we have an appointment at 1:00."
"LORELAI: Well, I'll go with you."
"RICHARD: They're only expecting two of us."
"LORELAI: Wee they can squeeze in one more. Huh, promise I won't break anything. Come on, take me there."
"EMILY: It's actually not for a while, so we can't take you there now."
"LORELAI: Perfect, then we'll hit Madison house first. It's just a 10-minute walk. Come on."
"RICHARD: All right. Lead the way."
"LORELAI: Cool you know I'd say let's drive, but our streets, forget about it."
"EMILY: What about the streets?"
"LORELAI: Oh, they're clogged night and day. Yep, total gridlock. It's not gonna help when they build that big box store."
"EMILY: They're building a box store?"
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, right in the center of town."
"RICHARD: Those things are hideous."
"LORELAI: Yeah, it's gonna wipe out all our local businesses. This place will be a ghost town. Ooh, hold your breath. Oh, god, sorry. Sewer problems."
"RICHARD: Your public-works department needs to be notified."
"LORELAI: No, they're on strike. Well, they're always on strike. [Coughs] Excuse me."
"EMILY: Allergies?"
"LORELAI: Meth lab."

"MATTHEW: We need our own bar."
"JESS: You say it like I'm fighting. I'm not fighting you."
"CHRIS: Same here."
"MATTHEW: We need a public place where the next De Kooning can run into the next Franz Kline and dis the next Jackson Pollock while the next Charlie Parker sh**t up in the corner."
"JESS: So a nice family place."
"MATTHEW: I'm not kidding. We'll call it ""Cedar Bar Redux."""
"JESS: I would kick my own ass if we called it that."
"CHRIS: Why don't we call it ""Devoid of Original Ideas Poseur Bar""?"
"JESS: [Laughs]"
"MATTHEW: Go to hell, both of you."
"JESS: Hey, come back for a hug, man."
"CHRIS: Hey, there's Alicia Matheson from the weekly."
"JESS: Whoa. Grab Matthew. Get him off the bar thing. Have him show her around. That's what he does best."
"CHRIS: Cedar bar redux."
"JESS: Yeah. [Chris walks off, then see someone] So my eyes don't deceive me."
"LUKE: First thing's first. What the hell is that?"
"JESS: It's an abstract painting."
"LUKE: But what is it supposed to be?"
"JESS: Check the title."
"LUKE: I did. It's called ""untitled."""
"JESS: There you go."
"LUKE: I give up."
"JESS: So you got the invite."
"LUKE: I got the invite."
"JESS: I guess I didn't think you'd come."
"LUKE: You guessed wrong, nephew."
"JESS: Cool. So you want the tour?"
"LUKE: Give me a tour."
"JESS: All right, well, this is where we work, truncheon books. There's usually desks and crap piled up everywhere, but we cleaned up for today. Those are the books that we put out. We publish our Zine once a month, except last august, when my partner forgot to pay the printer. We let local artists hang their stuff up without ripping them off on commissions. We do performances over there, and a few of us live upstairs. That you don't want to see. It's a disaster zone."
"LUKE: This is yours, right?"
"JESS: Yeah."
"LUKE: I wanted to get it, but I couldn't find it."
"JESS: Yeah, it's not exactly ""the Da Vinci code."""
"LUKE: Well, I will definitely get it today. By the way, that is your cousin."
"JESS: Right, Liz filled me in on all that, daddy."
"LUKE: She just calls me Luke. Total brain."
"JESS: You confirm paternity?"
"LUKE: Don't be a wiseass. Hey, April. I want you to meet somebody. Meet your cousin Jess. He's my sister's kid."
"APRIL: Hi."
"JESS: Hey."
"APRIL: Men in this family aren't chatty."
"JESS: Sorry."
"APRIL: I'm gonna go explore a little more."
"LUKE: Cool."
"JESS: How are you adjusting to all that?"
"LUKE: Okay, I guess. I like her, and she just sort of tolerates me."
"JESS: Seems like it."
"LUKE: Thanks for the perspective."
"JESS: That's why I'm here. Hey, come on. I got some sculpture over here you're really gonna hate."
"STARS HOLLOW"
"[Lorelai followed by Emily and Richard are walking down the street.]"
"LORELAI: Ooh, that garbage smell."
"EMILY: What garbage smell?"
"RICHARD: I don't smell garbage."
"LORELAI: Yeah, the wind shifted right after I said it. Allowing a landfill within a mile of city limits, crazy."
"RICHARD: It's within a mile?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, destroying everyone's land values. Oh, well. Where did you park?"
"RICHARD: Over on Peach Street."
"LORELAI: Oh, you mean carjack lane."
"EMILY: Carjack lane?"
"LORELAI: Better than chop shop alley. Here, follow me. Oh, god, watch out for the pothole. [jumps over very small hole in the street] Ooh, I tell you. The roads are just the things in between potholes, huh?"
"EMILY: Oh, dear."
"RICHARD: You should talk to your mayor about all these issues, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: You mean Gropey McGee? I cannot, will not ever put myself in that position again! Mind if we stop by the store? [Emily and Richard look worried]"
"[Cur to inside the Doose's Market]"
"LORELAI: Well, I'm running low on a lot of basics, and I just want to see if they got them in."
"EMILY: This is a cute little store."
"LORELAI: Well, if you can be cute and unclean at the same time. All right, let's see. No. No. No. Nope, and this is the only store in town."
"EMILY: What are you looking for?"
"LORELAI: What am I looking for? Everything. They have nothing. The little they have is off-brands, which wouldn't be so galling, except everything's so far past its expiration date. Hey, help yourself to some little George's chips. Yum, yum. Little George -- pass. Oh, and look. Here we have some Aunt Molly's ice cream. You'll notice there's no picture of Aunt Molly on the carton. I Googled her and got a mug sh*t, and all I could think was, ""I hope she hasn't been selling that stuff to kids."""
"TAYLOR: Excuse me. Lorelai, what are you doing?"
"LORELAI: Shopping, Taylor. Why?"
"TAYLOR: You're walking around disparaging my store, and not only is that insulting, it's against the law."
"LORELAI: Against the law?"
"TAYLOR: Code 14/b/14 triple backslash x-8 state that a citizen of stars hollow cannot denigrate stars hollow while standing on stars hollow soil. It was established in 1792. The original penalty was death by 40 muskets."
"LORELAI: Really, Taylor, you misheard me."
"TAYLOR: You made a crude joke about Aunt Molly."
"LORELAI: Well, you got to admit, Aunt Molly had it coming."
"TAYLOR: I don't joke about Aunt Molly."
"LORELAI: [To Emily and Richard] Can you say BTK?"
"TAYLOR: As town mayor, I could cite you on the spot."
"RICHARD: This is Gropey McGee?"
"LORELAI: Sh-sh… [Tries to stop Richard]"
"TAYLOR: I beg your pardon."
"EMILY: Oh, look at the time. Excuse me all, will you?"
"LORELAI: Mom, where you going?"
"EMILY: I'm just going to get something out of the car."
"LORELAI: No, mom. Mom, you don't know the safe streets. You walk down the wrong one, you die. [Looks at Taylor] Commence writing me up, Taylor."

"LUKE: Is this any good?"
"APRIL: Mmm."
"MATTHEW: I don't know what she's gonna write."
"JESS: We're not supposed to know what she's gonna write. She's a member of the independent press."
"MATTHEW: She played it close to the vest. You know, I hate that."
"JESS: Go get a beer. Stop obsessing. [see someone walk in] Well, isn't this a day of surprises?"
"RORY: I didn't RSVP. Sorry."
"JESS: Ah, this isn't an RSVP type thing. Showing up's cool."
"RORY: Good thing. So this is Tuncheon Books?"
"JESS: Yeah. This is Truncheon."
"RORY: I like it. It makes me feel like I instantly want to create something. Give me a pen. Give me a brush. [surprised] Luke."
"JESS: Yeah, there's a definite ""Jess Mariano, this is your life"" vibe here today."
"JESS: Hey, Luke."
"LUKE: Bicycle?"
"JESS: No."
"LUKE: Rory, hi. What are you doing here?"
"RORY: Same thing your doing here."
"APRIL: Your books are really easy to skim."
"JESS: That'll make a nice blurb."
"LUKE: I was gonna take off, actually."
"JESS: Uh, I got to get something. Don't leave till I get back. I'll just be a minute."
"LUKE: Okay."
"APRIL: [To Rory] You have a great face."
"RORY: Thanks. So do you."
"LUKE: Yeah, uh, Rory, this is April."
"RORY: Oh, April. Hello there, April."
"APRIL: Hi."
"RORY: [To Luke] The famous April."
"APRIL: I'm famous?"
"RORY: Kind of."
"LUKE: Uh, April, Rory's an old friend."
"APRIL: She doesn't look old."
"LUKE: I mean, I've known her well since she was your age. She's from stars hollow. She's actually the daughter of the woman I'm with, my fiancée, Lorelai. You met her that one time. It's kind of complicated."
"APRIL: I'll say."
"LUKE: You probably want to get back to that boyfriend of yours."
"APRIL: He's not my boyfriend. Jeez. [Rolls her eyes["
"JESS: [To Luke Quietly] Hay come here. Here. [Hands Luke a copy of his book]"
"LUKE: Oh, let me, let me buy this. That way, you would get the money."
"JESS: Ah, it's okay."
"LUKE: What's this?"
"JESS: It's what's owed."
"LUKE: You owe me nothing."
"JESS: I owe you. Take it. If you rip it up, I'm just gonna send another."
"LUKE: [Sighs] I'm very proud of you, of this, of what you're going for here. I don't get all of it, but I'm me."
"JESS: Thanks. [They hug]"
"APRIL: [To Rory] All I said was that I liked him. I realized it was a mistake as soon as I said it."
"LUKE: We should get going."
"APRIL: Nice meeting you."
"RORY: Nice meeting you, too. Good luck with everything."
"LUKE: [To Jess] Good Luke with this, congratulations."
"JESS: Okay thanks. [To April] See ya."
"APRIL: Bye."

"RORY: I guess."
"JESS: Cool…Come on."
"LUKE'S DINER"
"LORELAI: Oh, well, we'll be lucky to get a table. Huh, there's absolutely nowhere else to eat in town, and even being Luke's fiancée doesn't guarantee me a meal when I want one."
"CAESAR: Oh, great, more customers."
"RICHARD: Well, there seem to be a few tables available."
"LORELAI: None of the good ones, unfortunately. All right, you phoned mom, you told her to meet us here. What, is she late?"
"RICHARD: No, she's right there."
"LORELAI: Oh, all right. What is wrong with this picture? [Emily is at a table with at little girl]"
"RICHARD: They're playing cards."
"LORELAI: I can see that be who is that she's playing with?"
"RICHARD: I have no idea. Do they have ham here?"
"LORELAI: Ham? Sure."
"RICHARD: Get me a ham and Swiss on rye, dry, nothing on it."
"LORELAI: Where are you going?"
"RICHARD: I'll be back in a bit."
"LORELAI: Dad, wa-- dad."
"EMILY: Do you have any 8s?"
"GIRL: Go fish."
"EMILY: Oh, you. I was sure you had 8s. Hi, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Hi, mom. What you doing?"
"EMILY: Oh, Sissy and I are playing go fish. She's good, too. It's your turn."
"SISSY: Do you have any jacks?"
"EMILY: Unbelievable. She's won three games in a row. She's a little champ."
"SISSY: I keep getting lucky."
"EMILY: It's not luck. You said she was smart, but this is something else. You get to go again."
"LORELAI: Oh my God, Mom."
"SISSY: Do you have any 3s?"
"EMILY: Nope. Go fish."
"LORELAI: Mom, who do you think this is?"
"EMILY: Luke's daughter. [Lorelai sighs] Isn't it?"
"LORELAI: No."
"EMILY: You're not Luke's daughter?"
"SISSY: Unh-unh."
"EMILY: I don't believe this. This isn't Luke's daughter?"
"LORELAI: It's definitely not Luke's daughter."
"EMILY: And here I was bonding with it. Who is this? Who are you?"
"SISSY: Umm…"
"LORELAI: Never mind, honey. Do you live close by?"
"SISSY: Two blocks."
"LORELAI: Okay, why don't you go home where it's safe?"
"SISSY: Okay."
"EMILY: You're telling me I played this insipid game for a half an hour and it's not even Luke's daughter?"
"LORELAI: What made you think it was Luke's daughter?"
"EMILY: Well, it told me it was someone's daughter here."
"LORELAI: Well, she must have meant someone in town."
"EMILY: Then she's a moron. Why would I play cards if there wasn't a family connection?"
"LORELAI: I guess she just thought you were being nice."
"EMILY: The little idiot kept tipping her cards so I could see them. So I pretended I didn't and specifically asked for what I knew she didn't have. The kid's a moron."
"LORELAI: Okay, mom. She's gone now."
"EMILY: Is it so stupid to think that she's Luke's daughter? She looks like Luke."
"LORELAI: Mom, you can trust me that there will be no contact between you and Luke's daughter anytime soon."
"EMILY: What does that mean?"
"LORELAI: It means that I don't even see her. Luke and I have an arrangement."
"EMILY: What kind of arrangement?"
"LORELAI: Well, he, I mean, you know, we mutually decided that I probably shouldn't have any contact with her."
"EMILY: What? That's ridiculous."
"LORELAI: No, it is what it is. It's what we want."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you and Luke are in a relationship. You're going to be husband and wife, and sissy's his daughter."
"LORELAI: No, no. That was sissy. April is his daughter."
"EMILY: You know what I mean. You have to have a relationship with this girl. It's imperative."
"LORELAI: Mom, you don't know the whole story."
"EMILY: But I know your handiwork when I see it, playing cautious when you should be diving in. That girl is his blood relation, and you need to get to know her. You'll be in her life for the rest of your life."
"LORELAI: Mom, it isn't just me."
"EMILY: I can't believe Luke is letting you get away with this. The sooner you embrace your role in this girl's life, the better off you'll be, mark my words. Where's your father?"
"LORELAI: He ran off to something."
"EMILY: That's right we had another appointment. I'll find him. Then we have to leave. He needs to get back to work."
"LORELAI: All right, goodbye, mom."
"EMILY: Goodbye. [To Caesar] You. You could have told me that wasn't Luke's daughter."
"CAESAR: I hate customers."

"JESS: He changed up on us. He wasn't supposed to premiere new material tonight."
"MATTHEW: It wasn't bad."

"MATTHEW: It was a little rambling."
"CHRIS: And what was that whole part about desiring Golda Meir?"
"JESS: Please tell me that was symbolic."
"MATTHEW: I'll talk to my poet."
"CHRIS: Hey, we're hitting that bar that we're not going to call ""Cedar Bar Redux."" You coming?"
"JESS: Yeah, maybe. You know, go on ahead. I'll catch up. [Goes over to Rory.] You know, you don't have to read it again."
"RORY: I know I don't."
"JESS: God, there are so many things I would change in it."
"RORY: Like what?"
"JESS: I'd keep the back cover. Everything else goes."
"RORY: You know why I love your book?"
"JESS: Why?"
"RORY: It doesn't remind me of anything. It's not a rip-off. It's just you."
"JESS: High praise, miss Yale editor."
"RORY: Yeah, well, I don't get to write as much as I would like, I, mostly assigning and motivating, hand-holding, and rewriting."
"JESS: Yeah, and you love it, every minute of it. Come on, tell me you don't."
"RORY: I do. I do love it. It's exciting."
"JESS: Yeah, you look happier than when I saw you last."
"RORY: I am."
"JESS: So you fixed everything?"
"RORY: Yeah, everything's fixed."
"JESS: I'm glad you're here."
"RORY: Yeah, me too. {Jess leans in and they kiss, Rory pulls away]"
"JESS: What?"
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"JESS: About what?"
"RORY: Uh, about coming here like this. I just got the flier, and I don't know. I just wanted to see your place, but then this... it's not fair to you. I'm such a jerk."
"JESS: I don't know what you're talking about."
"RORY: And I couldn't even cheat on him the way he cheated on me."
"JESS: Who? Who cheated on y…that guy? [Sighs] You're still with him."
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: I thought everything was fixed."
"RORY: Everything but him."
"JESS: I hate this."
"RORY: You should. I'm sorry."
"JESS: You came here alone, to Philadelphia."
"RORY: He was out of town."
"JESS: I don't deserve this, Rory."
"RORY: No, you don't. You don't deserve it. I just... I'm in love with him. Despite all the bad he's done, I can't help it. I'm in love with him."
"JESS: Love, huh?"
"RORY: Yeah."
"JESS: I guess I'll call Matthew's poet and have him explain love to me. Poets know all about it, right?"
"RORY: They're supposed to."
"RORY: Well, I, I guess I better go."
"JESS: Okay."
"RORY: I'm so sorry that I came here."
"JESS: I'm not. It's what it is, you, me. Where did you park?"
"RORY: Um, I'm right outside."
"JESS: Hey, if, uh, if it makes you feel better, you can always tell him that we did something."

"KELLY: So I have pamphlets for the kids to read about Amish country. Should we hand them out now?"
"ROY: I think that's a good idea."
"LUKE: Oh I'll do it, I've got something for April here, so I was about to sneak back there anyway."
"KELLY: Thank you, Luke."
"LUKE: [Luke goes to the kids] Hey, everybody. Sorry to interrupt. I got some pamphlets here, a little info on Amish country. It's got some pictures, but we're gonna see it, so you don't have to look at the pictures. It's got stuff to read, too. So go ahead and pass the rest around there.

"At 4:00, we move on to dumplings. I'm going to open another window."
"LANE: Boy, there's a lot of activity down here."
"MRS KIM: It's going very well. Your aunt Jun is a wizard with the Kimchi."
"LANE: Well, is there anything I can do to help?"

"LANE: But mama"
"MRS KIM: You come down, cooking stops. [pointing upstairs] Up."
"LANE: But it's hot up there mama, and you know what rises with the hot air? The smell of 10 pounds of Kimchi. I'm getting woozy."
"MRS KIM: Well, pull your sweater over your face. Just get back upstairs. [Goes to answer knock on the door]"

"LORELAI: It is indeed."
"MRS KIM: Wonderful Lane, the dress. Well, come on, let's see it."
"LORELAI: Okay"
"MRS KIM: [Telephone ringing] Hold that thought. [Goes to answer phone]"
"LANE: You couldn't have set it on fire?"
"LORELAI: Dude, there's not enough lighter fluid in the world."
"LANE: I hope you made a matching blindfold so Zach doesn't have to actually see me in it."
"LORELAI: Now, come on. You're gonna look beautiful. You have a very pretty face, and you have hands and feet. For some guys, the stuff in between is just annoying."

"MRS KIM: Right. Go ahead."
"LORELAI: Um, now, there were a couple of stains on it, just probably from age, so I had to make a few minor adjustments, but I think you'll see, all in all, that the integrity of the dress has remained intact. [Lane is very please, Mrs Kim doesn't seen to care]"
"MRS KIM: Fine. How much do I owe you?"
"LORELAI: Uh, nothing. Um, consider it a wedding gift."
"MRS KIM: Okay, I have to go back to work. I will see you and Luke at the wedding."
"LORELAI: Yes, you will. I mean, you'll see me. Luke is out of town, but I'm gonna take pictures and make him feel really bad he missed it. It's a thing we do."
"MRS KIM: Whatever. Goodbye."
"LANE: Did she see it?"
"LORELAI: I held it up right in front of her face."

"LORELAI: Okay."

"LORELAI: Uh, well, I mean, Luke's left town. He's gone far away from town. Town's there, and Luke's over here."

"RORY: No"
"PARIS: When I first started writing, I believed passionately that tenure was a reward for excellent service and a way for a school to attract the very best teachers from all over the country."
"RORY: So let's go with that."
"PARIS: But once I finished writing I started thinking about the other side of the argument, I mean money and employment for the rest of your life? No matter what. Where is the incentive to keep the standards high? I mean Remember professor Leavers? He got tenured and lost all interest. Just sat there dowie and sleepy It was like being taught by Jimmy Kimmel."

"RORY: Well, thanks for the invite, but I can't."
"ROSEMARY: What, why?"
"JULIET: Don't you want to see Logan after six days without a shower?"
"ROSEMARY: Or styling gel."
"RORY: I have a wedding to go to, and I'm leaving in a minute to head home."
"ROSEMARY: Rats."
"JULIET: Logan will be very disappointed."
"RORY: Well I'll hide the soap and the Kiehl's, and we can re-enact it when he gets back."
"JULIET: Hmm, I'm feeling a chill from the north."
"ROSEMARY: Okay, well, if you change your mind and please change your mind, call my cell, we leave at Ten."
"RORY: Have a safe flight."
"JULIET: [Too so guys] Woodward, Bernstein."
"RORY: Okay and that's it, layout's done. A.K.?"
"A.K.: 3:20."
"RORY: I'm audi. Jill, approve Paris' piece when it's in."
"PARIS: I can't pick a side. Either way I look at it, I'm right."
"RORY: I'll see you Monday, Paris."
"DRAGONFLY INN"
"[Front desk, Lorelai is getting things ready for the bachelorette party]"
"MICHEL: You know I hear the weather's supposed to be beautiful tomorrow."
"LORELAI: Hum."
"MICHEL: How big a wedding do you think it will be?"
"LORELAI: I don't know."
"MICHEL: I hope it's a big wedding. I love big weddings. What time are you picking me up tomorrow?"
"LORELAI: Noon."
"MICHEL: Ah non is fine that will give me plenty of time to get ready. You know, I hope you don't stay out too late tonight. You'll be tired for tomorrow."
"LORELAI: I will not be tired."
"MICHEL: I wouldn't drink too much, either, you'll be puffy."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll keep it to half a box of wine, max."
"MICHEL: I'm just saying, tomorrow is a very special day. You need to be perfect."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'm not getting married, Michel."
"MICHEL: [A little laughing] I know that, but you are going to be with me, and I'm going to look fantastic, and you know that who you are with is always a reflection of yourself, and I don't want my reflection to look like Judy Garland, the mark Herron years."
"LORELAI: Michel stop. Now, I'm going to be wearing my blue pinstripes, so if you wear something in an ice blue or [Gasps] Oh, yes, silver, that would look amazing. No one would take their eyes off of us."
"LORELAI: And how delighted the bride will be."
"MICHEL: Now let's discuss dancing. As you know, I'm a fabulous dancer, Deney Terrio level and I intend to dance a lot. It's what I do at parties to compensate for the elevated calorie intake. I just shake it all off."
"LORELAI: Well, I promise to duck."
"MICHEL: I don't understand your attitude. After all, these are your friends. I don't even know them."
"SOOKIE: [OS] Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Yeah."
"SOOKIE: [OS] Lorelai! Help Lorelai, oh my God...problem. [Sookie comes running out with a covered tray] Something went very, very wrong."
"LORELAI: Wrong with what?"
"SOOKIE: Remember the dirty cookies I was baking for the bachelorette gift baskets?"
"LORELAI: Ha?"
"SOOKIE: Well, they expanded in the oven."
"LORELAI: Expanded? What do you mean? [Sookie uncovers the tray] Oh, dear!"
"SOOKIE: I know."
"LORELAI: Hello, Tommy Lee."
"SOOKIE: I don't know what happened. Too much yeast."
"LORELAI: Well, I cannot put those in the bags with the shiny tiaras and the bubble wands."
"SOOKIE: I know, I know. I know. I'll go try and figure something out."
"LORELAI: [Cell phone rings, Lorelai answers] Hello?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lore, you got a minute?"
"LORELAI: Um…"
"[Dance music plays]"
"MICHEL: [To Lorelai] You see? This is what you're up against."
"LORELAI: [Looks at Michel, then to Chris] Yes, I have a minute."
"CHRISTOPHER: I just got Rory one of those Sidekicks. Actually I got it for her a couple of days ago, so she already has it. Then I realize that It's one of those things I should have run past you. So I'm running it past you now. Is that okay? 'Cause if it's not, I can take it back. I'll just say I read something in consumer reports about radiation levels."
"LORELAI: Chris, honey, we're way past the point where you have to get my permission to buy your own daughter a gift."
"CHRISTOPHER: We are."
"LORELAI: Yes didn't you get the memo?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, you know what a mess my desk is."
"LORELAI: I think it's nice that you bought Rory a gift."
"CHRISTOPHER: Good."
"LORELAI: So, how are you?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm great."
"LORELAI: Yeah? How's G.G.?"
"CHRISTOPHER: She's, well, hold on a sec. [Holds the phone up] You hear that?"
"LORELAI: No."
"CHRISTOPHER: Exactly."
"LORELAI: Oh, come on. It's naptime."
"CHRISTOPHER: Not until 4:00, my friend."
"LORELAI: Then she's holding her breath until you buy her a Porsche."
"CHRISTOPHER: She is in her room playing with her toys, shining her halo as we speak."
"LORELAI: Well, well, well, look who's cracking the whip."
"CHRISTOPHER: I got to tell you, that ""no"" word is pretty awesome. I can't wait to try out the ""you're grounded."""
"LORELAI: So...[Sees Michel dancing, turns away.] Anyway..."
"MRS KIM'S HOUSE"
"RORY: Lane, I'm here, and I…"
"MRS KIM: Move!"
"RORY: Lane, hi, I…"
"LANE: Coming through!"
"RORY: Am I here early?"
"LANE: Sorry. Hi, glad you're here."
"RORY: What's going on? And where's all your stuff?"
"LANE: My grandma's coming."
"RORY: Well Jeez, how big is she?"
"LANE: She hasn't been out of Korea in 45 years because she refuses to travel, so we figured there's no way she'd come, but she called today, and she's coming."
"RORY: So that's nice right?"
"MRS KIM: [OS] Help me!"
"LANE: Coming!"
"RORY: Whoa, big Buddha!"
"MRS KIM: Save the commentary. Grab the feet."
"RORY: Okay."
"MRS KIM: Be careful. Don't let it drop."
"RORY: What happens if it drops?"
"MRS KIM: It breaks."
"RORY: Oh, you ask a stupid question..."
"MRS KIM: Down, here. [Grunts] I'll have the boys next door bring the other one in. [To Lane] Did you get the crucifixes out of the kitchen?"
"LANE: No"
"MRS KIM: Go, both of you! Go! Go!"
"RORY: Going."
"MRS KIM: And don't forget the Christ's-feet tea towel!"
"[Cut to the kitchen]"
"RORY: Okay, seriously, you have got to fill me in or I've gotta call my life line. What is with the Buddha?"
"LANE: Apparently my grandmother's a Buddhist."
"MRS KIM: Go hide these in your room."
"LANE: Closet?"
"MRS KIM: Uh, floorboards!"
"[Cut to Lane's old bed room]"
"RORY: I don't understand. So your grandma's Buddhist. Why are we [puts it together] oh, my god. She doesn't know."
"LANE: No."
"RORY: Your mother's mother does not know she's a seventh-day Adventist."
"LANE: And it would be a very big deal if she found out."
"RORY: That is so weird."
"LANE: Tell be about it I just discovered today that I am simply the latest link in a chain of Kim women who hide their real lives under floorboards away from their mothers."
"MRS KIM: [OS] Lane, she's here! I want all boys!"
"RORY: Praise Buddha!"
"[Cut to the top of the stairs looking down]"
"RORY: That's your mom's mom?"
"LANE: Yep."
"MRS KIM'S MOTHER: [To Lane, Korean] Hyun kyung! Jum e-ri nae ryeo wa bara!"
"RORY: I see the resemblance."
"MRS KIM'S MOTHER: [Korean] Ah, ipudda. Euhsuh o seyo, ha-l-money."
"LANE: [Korean] Wa jew shyeo suh nuh moo gibuh yo."
"MRS KIM'S MOTHER: [Korean] Yeo gi o ni, nuh moo jokkuna. [To Mrs Kim] Yeya, jugee wae bulss-awngul ba-ng anae noonguhya?"
"MRS KIM: [Korean] Chew udun jewngi uhso yo, uhmoney."
"MRS KIM'S MOTHER: [Korean] Ahyo! Irrokea duropku, dap dap hada. [Sniffs] Moon jom yeoreo ra! Majja, jom chiwo ya getda. Yanuh, wae gonghang ehsuh ahn nawanni. Uh? Na oji malla go -- ahoh, jungmal kiunni napuh. Bakkwoyachi. Beckpalbae julul olija. [Sighs]"
"RORY: What was that all about?"
"LANE: Three complaints, two insults, and a hefty dose of religious guilt."
"RORY: What are they doing now?"
"LANE: Their ritual of 108 bows."
"LORELAI: Should be called 108 ""ows."" [Chuckles] Oh, my mother would have liked that one. It's kind of hypnotizing if you stare at it long enough."
"LANE: Oh, sh**t, we have to go. Uh, mama? Mama, we have to go, the bachelorette party. We're meeting the others at Doose's."
"MRS KIM: 80 to go."
"LANE: Okay, so, I'll see you later. Bye."
"DOOSE'S MARKET - NIGHT"
"[The girls come out with supplies. They are laughing.]"
"LORELAI: Ladies, ladies, please, I need your attention. This is a very serious subject here. Now, I need to do a quick check to make sure we have got all of our supplies. Rory Read off the list."
"RORY: Beer."
"LANE: Check."
"RORY: More beer,"
"SOOKIE: Check."
"RORY: Pretzels, and beer."
"GIRL1: Check."
"RORY: Alternative alcohol for those who don't like beer, and beer."
"GIRL2: Check."
"RORY: List complete, Sarge."
"LORELAI: Excellent now we are about to commence the first leg of our evening. Our dear friend Lane is about to get married, and it is our job to make sure we give her one night and one headache she will never forget."
"LANE: Hear, hear!"
"LORELAI: Now our first stop is the black, white, and read bookstore, where we will sneak in our booze, our treats, proceeded to get drunk and watch tonight's feature, ""American Gigolo."""
"SOOKIE: Featuring a little full-frontal from Mr. Gere himself."
"LORELAI: All right, let's go to the movies! [Cheering]"
"KYON: [Running up] Wait for me! Sorry I'm late. I had to wait for the two Mrs. Kims to sleep before I can climb down tree to meet you. Luckily all that bowing makes them sleep like dogs."
"RORY: It's okay, Kyon. We were just leaving."
"KYON: [Starts stripping] I had to get out of house. Stinks of Kimchi and incense. You can't breath. There's Buddha's everywhere staring at you. [Notices Lane and Rory starring at her] What?"
"LANE: When did you start double dressing and Avril Lavigne?!"
"KYON: Avril lavigne rocks. You are such a snob. If it's not Joy Division, you no like it. Well, you can't dance to Joy Division."
"[Rory's cell Sidekick rings]"
"LANE: [To Kyon] She's crazy! My whole family's crazy."
"RORY: Well, welcome to the club. We'll get sweatshirts."
"LORELAI: Hmm, secret admirer?"
"RORY: It's dad. He gave me this thing as a gift, you know. However, he also got himself one, and since then, he has been texting me every five minutes. It's insane you should have told him no when he ran this past you."
"LORELAI: I think it's nice you have a real daddy/daughter thing going on."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, he's shopping for celery at the supermarket. They're running a special."
"LORELAI: He's just excited."
"RORY: Yeah, well, now he's in the canned-peas aisle. Apparently he doesn't like peas, but he does like pea soup. Interesting, no? No!"
"LORELAI: All right, give me that. Um, okay. [texting] ""Your daughter is about to see Richard Gere's penis."" That should shut him up for a while. [they notice one of the girls vomiting] That's got to be some sort of record."
"RORY: Hmm."
"[Later that night near the gazebo]"
"SOOKIE: I don't understand. I checked the time of the movie twice."
"LORELAI: Well, the paper probably printed it wrong again."
"RORY: We could've just gone in."
"LORELAI: No, too risky. No way to know if we'd missed the money sh*t."
"SOOKIE: And ""American Gigolo"" without the ""gigo-down-low"" is pointless."
"LANE: So, what should we do now?"
"LORELAI: Uh, well, we could k*ll some time till the next showing."
"SOOKIE: Sure that's only 45 minutes."
"RORY: So where should we go."
"LORELAI: We could get some coffee."
"KYON: ""Partay."""
"SOOKIE: Well maybe we could play a game. I do that with the kids and time flies."
"LORELAI: I don't really think peek-a-boo's gonna fly, Sookie."
"SOOKIE: Well, we could make it more adult, you know? Peek-a-boo, take a sh*t. That could be fun."
"ZACH: Hey!"
"GIRLS: Hey!"
"ZACH: Didn't expect to see you guys here."
"LANE: We were gonna see ""American Gigolo,"" but we missed it."
"SOOKIE: I swear, I checked the time twice."
"RORY: We believe you Sookie."
"LANE: What are you guys doing here?"
"GIL: We just came from Dell's bar."
"BRIAN: It closed early 'cause it's Dell's wedding anniversary."
"LORELAI: Dell's is closed? sh**t. We were gonna go there after the movie."
"RORY: Well, we could go to the chimney sweep."
"SOOKIE: No it burnt down last week."
"RORY: That's ironic."
"GIL: We could drive over to beacon falls, anything open there?"
"LORELAI: No"
"BRIAN: We could go to my aunt's house. She's got a rec room with a record player."
"ZACH: No way that's completely lame. Which one's ""American Gigolo""? Is that the one where you see Richard Gere's Johnson? 'Cause that seems a little weird for a bachelor party."
"LANE: No, we are not doing this."
"ZACH: Doing What?"
"LANE: We are supposed to be getting wild at separate bachelor and Bachelorette parties! We cannot be bumping into each other all night long."
"LANE: Lady's right. Come on, men. Let's go find something wild to do."
"GUYS: Yeah!"
"LORELAI: [To the girls] You guys, we are looking pathetic now, all right? We are young, temporarily single girls on the prowl. There's plenty to do that we can be mortified about."
"RORY: Well, the t-shirts and tiaras are a start."
"LORELAI: Exactly, all right, ladies, come on. Let's go find us some fun."
"GIRLS: Yeah!"
"[Later outside Brian's Aunts house]"
"LORELAI: Five more seconds….That's it. Anyone?"
"RORY: Nope."
"LANE: Nope."
"LORELAI: Let's do it."
"[They knock on the door]"
"LANE: Hi. Are you Brian's aunt?"
"BRIAN'S AUNT: Oh, you must be Lane. The boys are downstairs in the rec room."
"LORELAI: Sounds like they have foosball."
"RORY: Foosball's fun."
"ZACH: Bachelorettes in the house!"
"LORELAI: Hey, boys!"
"BOY: Whoo!"
"KYON: Hey, look, there's a moose head."
"LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[They are getting ready for the wedding]"
"RORY: Dad's feet are two different sizes."
"LORELAI: Oh, for the love of, hey, [holding up two small bags] which one says, ""hi, I'm not a whore. Enjoy your day""?"
"RORY: The pink one."
"[phone rings]"
"RORY: Do not talk. We're going to be late."
"LORELAI: I talk fast. It's my gift. Hello?"
"MICHEL: I just got tickets to Céline Dion."
"LORELAI: What?"
"MICHEL: My friend Tessa just called and told me she has front-row tickets to Céline Dion, and I'm going with her."
"LORELAI: Well, that's great."
"MICHEL: I have been waiting forever to get this close to Céline. Oh, my god, I'm shaking like a leaf. What should I wear? What would Céline like me in?"
"LORELAI: I don't know, Michel, but I'm on my way to pick you up, so…"
"MICHEL: Oh, no. Don't bother. I'm not going to the wedding."
"LORELAI: What? Why not?"
"MICHEL: Because I'm going to Céline Dion, hello! What have I been saying to you?"
"LORELAI: No, Michel, you have to go to the wedding."
"MICHEL: Ah sorry I cannot."
"LORELAI: Well, you've already seen Céline Dion."
"MICHEL: Only five times, and never in the front row. I was in the balcony with the riffraff and the people who sneak in pot."
"LORELAI: Michel, you have to go. I need an escort. Find someone there, that's why single women go to weddings."
"LORELAI: I am not single. I'm engaged."
"MICHEL: Lorelai, I'm sorry. In the future, I owe you some kind of a favor, but tonight you're on your own."
"LORELAI: Michel…"
"MICHEL: I'll bring you a mouse pad. Bye-bye."
"LORELAI: [Hangs up the phone, groans] Michel is going to the Céline Dion concert."
"RORY: Bummer."
"LORELAI: What am I supposed to do now? Mrs. Kim made it very clear not to show up without a guy. This is ridiculous. Even when I have a man, I'm still the girl who doesn't have a man. This sucks! I've known Lane since she was a little kid. She's spent more time at our house than at her own, and now I'm gonna miss her wedding? Fracking Céline Dion!"
"RORY: You want me to see if dad can go with you?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"RORY: I've got him right here he's turning left on main, and he found a buffalo-head nickel in his glove compartment."
"LORELAI: No, I don't know it's Saturday. I'm sure he's busy."
"RORY: He just left the hardware store, and now he's parked on the side of the road trying to decide how many tacos he wants. I vote three, 'cause two just never seems enough."
"LORELAI: Okay, so he's not busy, but the wedding is starting in 45 minutes."
"RORY: He can be here in 20."
"LORELAI: Seriously?"
"RORY: Wow, four tacos. Quite a man, my father. So, what do you think? Should I pull the trigger?"
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Tell him to bring me a taco."
"RORY: Will do. T.P.T.D.I…"
"LORELAI: What does that mean?"
"RORY: ""totally psyched to do it."""
"LORELAI: He's making up his own acronyms?"
"RORY: Yeah, and he just learned how to make the happy face."
"LORELAI: Sorry, kid, what can I say, he was really hot in high school."
"KIM'S ANTIQUES - OUTSIDE"
"[Lorelai is waiting, some relatives of Lane's are watching and talking about Lorelai, Lorelai covers up some more]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey."
"LORELAI: Hi! [They kiss on the cheek]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sorry I'm late."
"LORELAI: Forget it, I can't believe you're doing this."
"CHRISTOPHER: My pleasure, wow you look great, do I this is the jacket I had with me in the car."
"LORELAI: Yeah yeah, you look fine."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey, check it out, buffalo-head nickel."
"LORELAI: Oh, great. Let's go. [They start going inside]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Go where."
"LORELAI: Uh, excuse me. Hi, Mrs. Kim. I'd like you to meet Christopher Hayden. He's Rory's father and a man."
"CHRISTOPHER: Did that really need clarification?"
"[Cut to inside]"
"LORELAI: She instructed me to bring a man today. I just wanted to show her that I can take direction well. You never know who knows Spielberg."
"CHRISTOPHER: Why did you have to bring a man?"
"LORELAI: Because an unmarried woman, alone, of a certain age, dressed the way I dress apparently is Korean for Jenna Jameson."
"CHRISTOPHER: Where's Luke?"
"LORELAI: Ah, out of town with his kid."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, well, then, lucky me. I always wanted to meet Jenna Jameson."
"RORY: There they are."
"LORELAI: Yes all nice and proper."
"CHRISTOPHER: Hey. [kisses Rory] This is very impressive."
"RORY: It's a Buddhist wedding."
"CHRISTOPHER: Is the Dalai Lama coming?"
"LORELAI: Yes, he's having the chicken."
"RORY: Oh it must be starting, you guys should stand over there."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay we'll wait for you."
"LORELAI: You don't get it ""He's having the chicken."" Dalai lama's a vegetarian. So obviously he's not having the chicken. Huh, sorry, should I have texted it to you instead?"
"[Korean music playing as the wedding party comes into the room]"
"*Note I tried my best with the following, anyone who could help it would be great."
"[The Minister starts the ceremony, then the two Mrs Kim's get into an argument]"
"KOREAN MINISTER: [Korean] g*n gokwihan sunmool ipmeda. Choshim duryo hapneda. Chongkyung baddya hapneda."

"CHRISTOPHER: Whoa!"
"LORELAI: Hey!"
"CHRISTOPHER: What the hell is happening?!"
"LORELAI: Are there bulls coming out of there?"
"CHRISTOPHER: We would've heard the china breaking."
"LORELAI: My God."
"RORY: Why aren't you running?"
"LORELAI: Why should we be running?"
"RORY: To get to the church for the wedding."
"LORELAI: For what?"
"RORY: For the wedding."
"CHRISTOPHER: I thought this was the wedding."
"RORY: The grandmother's wedding. Now we do the mother's wedding."
"LORELAI: Why do we have to run?"
"RORY: Because there's 58 seats and 62 Koreans."
"LORELAI: [Taking Chris's arm] Oh, boy! Go!"

"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, nice to see you again."

"LORELAI: Beautiful."
"JACKSON: Perfect weather."

"LORELAI: 58 seats, 62 Koreans."

"JACKSON: I'm on it."
"[Cut to inside the church]"
"LORELAI: What do you see? Do you see anything open?"
"SOOKIE: We'll take two and two! Two and two is fine."
"LORELAI: We can find four together."
"SOOKIE: I don't think we can."
"LORELAI: I see something. Patty, Patty!"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, hi, honey. What a pretty dress. Oh, the things you can pull off with that body."
"JACKSON: These all taken?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, no, I just thought I'd save some in case. Here, come sit."
"LORELAI: It's a mad house in here, how did you get all these seats together?"
"MISS PATTY: Honey, I've been here all night."
"SOOKIE: You're kidding. Why?"
"MISS PATTY: 58 seats and 62 Koreans? Please. [holding a bag] Carrot sticks?"
"CHURCH – BRIDAL ROOM"
"LANE: God, look at me. I look like a bride."
"RORY: [giggling] You are a bride."
"LANE: I feel so weird."
"RORY: I want a picture."
"LANE: Of me feeling weird?"
"RORY: No, of me standing next to you while you're feeling weird. [sets up the camera on a bench on auto.]"
"[The door opens]"
"MRS KIM: Everything all right?"
"RORY: Uh, yeah, Mrs. Kim. Everything's fine."
"MRS KIM: Hmm. The dress looks different."
"LANE: Really? Does it? Everything looks different through the eyes of a bride."
"MRS KIM: Rory, can you excuse us a moment?"
"RORY: Sure. I'll be right outside."
"LANE: Mama, is something wrong? 'Cause the dress…"
"MRS KIM: Forget the dress. Sit down, please. [They sit] Uh...Lane, I have something very upsetting to talk to you about."
"LANE: Oh, what?"
"MRS KIM: It concerns the wedding night."
"LANE: Oh, boy."
"MRS KIM: Yes, ""oh, boy."" Marriage is a job, Lane. There are rewards that come with this job, but there are also sacrifices. There are things you're going to have to do."
"LANE: Things?"
"MRS KIM: Terrible things."
"LANE: Mama, you don't have to…"
"MRS KIM: You need to hear this, you need to know what to expect. It will start early."
"LANE: What will?"
"MRS KIM: The man's expectations. It starts early, at the wedding, actually. At the wedding, you're going to have to kiss him."
"LANE: Mama."
"MRS KIM: You will then be expected to share a bed tonight and when you're in that bed you're expected to…"
"LANE: Mama, please."
"MRS KIM: You're going to have to do it with this boy, Lane. You're just going to have to do it. Hopefully if you're lucky like me, you'll only have to do it once."
"LANE: [Groans]"
"CHURCH"
"[Piano plays Mendelssohn's ""wedding march"", people start coming down the aisle Mrs Kim, Rory and Lane]"
"LORELAI: You know, I remember the day I met Lane. It was Rory's first day of kindergarten, and she insisted on wearing my ""Chico and the Man"" t-shirt, which I thought would either elicit confused shrugs or label her as a weird '70s-sitcom kid. And we walked in the classroom, and Lane came running up to her and offered to share her crayons with her. And I was so grateful, 'cause I thought even if Lane turned out to be a psycho, bad-seed, k*ll kid, at least Rory had a friend. Who knew it would turn out to be a lifelong friendship?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Well there you are there's plenty of time for them to have a stupid fight and them to screw it up."
"[Everyone sits]"
"KOREAN MINISTER 2: Sanrang hanun yoroboon, onul ooriga I-jarieyea moinkusun..."

"SOOKIE: I thought it was beautiful. What an elegant dress."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, the dress did look nice, didn't it?"
"JACKSON: I'm gonna go call the babysitter."
"SOOKIE: I'll go with you, [to Lorelai] we have this new babysitter. She's 17, sweet as can be, perfect student, references up the wazoo. She seems absolutely perfect in every way."
"LORELAI: Well, she's probably a crackhead."
"JACKSON: Thank you. I'm calling right now."
"SOOKIE: I'll go with you."
"LORELAI: Let's go find the bar."
"CHRISTOPHER: Right behind you."
"ZACH: It was awesome, man. Just flowed right down to the ground. Major league comfortable There's a reason Buddhists are so peaceful. You have to see it."
"GIL: Yeah, I'm just happy to have another married guy around."
"ZACH: Hey just 'cause I'm married now doesn't mean we're gonna have any Dr. Phil moments."
"[Kyon walks past and Brian watches.]"
"GIL: Just wait, my friend, just wait till the first time you don't bring home the dry cleaning."
"ZACH: Dude, this is my day. Can we not talk about dry cleaning?"
"GIL: Absolutely"
"ZACH: Thank you…This robe, it must be made of silk, 'cause it is so soft."
"GIL: Silk, huh? Bet it's hand-wash only."
"[Cut to Lorelai and Chris]"
"LORELAI: That definitely was not the bar."
"CHRISTOPHER: Maybe it's over there."
"LORELAI: No, that's the gift table."
"CHRISTOPHER: Did we try behind the church?"
"LORELAI: Twice. There has to be a bar."
"[Sookie and Jackson walk up]"
"JACKSON: We called Darla, if that is her real name and apparently everything's fine. Hey, where's the bar?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Just wondering that our selves."
"RORY: There you guys are. I was very proud of the lack of heckling coming from your section."
"LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, we were real good now, where's the bar?"
"RORY: Shh, don't say that so loud."
"LORELAI: What, no! No way, no bar? Are you kidding?"
"RORY: Mom."
"LORELAI: What they don't have to drink it."
"[They hear a noise and see something happening at the tables.]"
"LORELAI: If we can't drink, might as well go get something to eat."
"RORY: That food is not for you."
"LORELAI: What, hold on, is this the ""not married"" thing again? Did you tell them I'm engaged? Engaged has got to be worth a sparerib."
"JACKSON: What the hell are they doing?"
"[People line up to get food and give checks to Lane who is at the end of the table, the people then leave in their cars.]"
"LORELAI: Well, there's something you don't see every day."
"LANE: [Korean] Gomawoeyo."
"MRS KIM: [Korean] Wa jew shyeo suh gomawoeyo."
"LANE: Wow, we just made it."
"MRS KIM: Ah, yes. They really cleaned us out. Let's see the bag. [They look inside] Nice haul."
"LANE: I can't believe your friends gave me all this money."
"MRS KIM: They're good people. They know you're a good girl. Lester Chin probably stiffed you."
"LANE: That's okay."
"MRS KIM: I can take those checks back home, put them in the safe for you."
"LANE: Sure, that'd be great."
"MRS KIM: It was a very nice ceremony."
"LANE: It was."
"MRS KIM: The second one."
"LANE: I know."
"MRS KIM: Thank you for doing two ceremonies. It was very important to your grandmother."
"LANE: It was fun, made my wedding seem a little more special."
"MRS KIM: Well, it's good you see it that way…Alright well, all my guests are gone. I'm going home."
"LANE: Are you sure?"
"MRS KIM: Yes, I'm very tired, I'm going to go home and go straight to bed."
"LANE: Well okay."
"MRS KIM: I'm going to wear earplugs tonight, the good ones that expand in your ears, so I won't be able to hear anything that might be going on out in the street at all hours of the night."
"LANE: Thank you, mama, for everything. And look at it this way. You're not losing a daughter. You're gaining a son...[looks over to Zach] who likes to wear a dress."
"MRS KIM: He had better make you happy."
"LANE: He will."
"MRS KIM: Don't let him take pictures in that thing."
"[Mrs Kim walks home, Lane signals to Kirk]"
"KIRK: We're on, boys! [To Zach] Excuse me, where do you want it, sir?"
"ZACH: Close, dude, really, really close."
"KIRK: Roger, wilco. Drop it and stack it, boys."
"LORELAI: Excuse me. Hold on a second. There's something wrong with your dress here. Let me just, got it."

"RORY: Yeah, Kirk?"
"KIRK: I have to ask you something. Do you think he's yummy enough?"
"RORY: Who?"
"KIRK: Troy."
"RORY: The bartender?"
"KIRK: Yes. See, I put this company together for the sole purpose of bringing truly yummy bartenders to the lonely women of stars hollow, but they really have to be yummy. I'm talking mouth-watering, tasty morsels of manhood, which, by the way, was the original name of the business, but it was already taken by a firm in Woodbridge."
"RORY: Really"
"KIRK: Yeah, now, when I first met troy, I thought he was the epitome of yummy, you know? But now I see him in the moonlight, I'm not so sure."
"RORY: Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Kirk. I think Troy's plenty yummy."
"KIRK: You do?"
"RORY: Yeah, I really do… Can I go now?"
"KIRK: Yes, thank you. Enjoy your evening."
"[Cut to Lorelai sitting at a table on a cell phone]"
"LORELAI: Yes, hi. Is Sookie or Jackson there? No. All right. Well, just tell them Lorelai called. Thank you."
"JACKSON: Well."
"LORELAI: She didn't sound drunk at all."
"JACKSON: But she sounded like there was a guy there, right?"
"LORELAI: No."
"JACKSON: What about a pimp did you hear a pimp?"
"LORELAI: Yes I heard a pimp, but he sounded like he had a heart of gold. I don't understand. She's too perfect."
"RORY: Who's too perfect?"
"LORELAI: You are. Ooh extra cherries, cheers."
"RORY: Cheers."
"LORELAI: Rory, your father has something he wants to tell you."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, I just want to apologize for my Sidekick stalking. I realize now that I have a problem."
"LORELAI: Which is the first step to recovery. The second step is that he's now given the Sidekick to me."
"RORY: No."
"LORELAI: Yes!"
"RORY: That's worse."
"LORELAI: [pretending to use one] ""Hi, Rory. What are you doing? What are you wearing? What are you thinking? What about now? Do you miss me? Do you think I'm pretty? Where do babies come from?"""
"CHRISTOPHER: Thanks a lot, mister."
"[Zach and Lane come up]"
"LANE: Hi."
"[Everyone says hello]"
"SOOKIE: Hello there."
"JACKSON: Kudos on the hot dogs, by the way."
"LANE: Zach's idea."
"ZACH: Lane came up with the fries though."
"LORELAI: You are so perfect together."
"SOOKIE: You having fun?"
"LANE: Yes, a little too much fun."
"ZACH: We actually thought we should make the rounds before we're too toasted to remember who you are. [pointing to Chris] Who are you?"
"RORY: Zach, this is my dad, Christopher, this is Zach."
"CHRISTOPHER: Congratulations, man. Nice weddings."
"ZACH: Thank dude."
"RORY: Hey I want to take a picture of everyone with Lane and Zach."
"LORELAI: Oh, god, I hate the paparazzi."
"RORY: Come on get in the picture, say ""cheese."""
"EVERYONE: Cheese!"
"RORY: Thanks you."
"LANE: Okay. We should go. We have six more tables to hit. If we forget to say it later, we are really glad you came."
"ZACH: Later."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm out."
"LORELAI: Let me see the picture."
"RORY: No, you'll delete it."
"LORELAI: Not if is it's good."
"RORY: You erase every picture I take of you."
"LORELAI: No, only the ones where I look like Rhoda."
"RORY: You never look like Rhoda."
"LORELAI: Occasional I look like Rhoda."
"RORY: Fine, here."
"LORELAI: Wow, you have a lot of pictures."
"RORY: I like proof, okay?"
"LORELAI: Wait, go back."
"RORY: What."
"LORELAI: Flip back. Who's that?"
"RORY: That's me with April."
"LORELAI: [Surprised] Oh. When did you meet April?"
"RORY: Um, when I went to Philadelphia for Jess' open house."
"LORELAI: Jess? Philadelphia? What am I missing here?"
"RORY: Nothing. Jess' work had an open house, I was invited, and I went and Luke showed up there with April. It was a total fluke."
"LORELAI: God, I didn't know you were seeing jess."
"RORY: Well, I'm not seeing him. We're just friends."
"LORELAI: Does Logan know you went to see Jess?"
"RORY: No, Logan was in Costa Rica."
"LORELAI: Huh."
"RORY: I swear, nothing happened there."
"LORELAI: Okay. Met April, took a picture together like you're pals."
"RORY: I swear, mom, it was a crazy coincidence. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I just...I felt so weird about it."
"LORELAI: Oh, sure, I get it."
"RORY: Look it's not like Luke was trying to introduce her to me. I walked in, they were there."
"LORELAI: Yeah, right. Okay, fluke."
"RORY: Are you okay?"
"LORELAI: I'm fine. I'm gonna get another drink. Do you want anything? [She shakes her head] Okay, I'll be right back. [Rory looks sad]"
"[Cut to Zach on stage]"
"ZACH: What's up, stars hollow? Who likes my robe? [Cheers and applause] Thanks. I'm liking it myself. Okay, tonight is not only the night I married the coolest girl on the planet. It is also the world premiere of the newly reunited Hep Alien. [Cheers and applause] It feels great to be back. [Cheers and applause continue as he goes to Lane and they kiss.] Zach starts to sing ""I'm a believer""."

"LULU: Kirk, I swear, nothing happened!"
"KIRK: I know what I saw! He put fruit in your drink, lots of fruit!"
"LULU: I asked him for the fruit. I was hungry."
"KIRK: Attention, partygoers and revelers, as I have just recently fired all of the yummy bartenders, from now on, the bar is serve-yourself."
"LULU: Kirk!"
"KIRK: Too yummy! Way too yummy!"
"LULU: Kirk this is crazy."
"[Kyon and Brian are making out, cut to Chris and Rory.]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Boy, I tell you, if you have to get married, this is the way to do it."
"RORY: ""Have to get married""? Oh, my, so cynical and jaded."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, we can't all be cool like Zach."
"RORY: I think they're really happy."
"CHRISTOPHER: Good that's the way it's supposed to be. I'm glad I came to this thing tonight."
"RORY: Me to."
"CHRISTOPHER: So, where's Logan?"
"RORY: Oh, uh, he's in Costa Rica."
"CHRISTOPHER: Costa Rica? Work, play?"
"RORY: Play, always play."
"CHRISTOPHER: Really what's he doing?"
"RORY: Oh, he's gonna jump off something and raft down somewhere, climb up a thing, swing around on a vine, stuff like that."
"CHRISTOPHER: Listen, I want you to know that I like him. I like him, and I like you, and I like you and him together."
"RORY: Well, good."
"CHRISTOPHER: I just want you to know that I approve."
"RORY: Dad, it's not like we're getting married."
"CHRISTOPHER: But if that changes, I just want you to know..."
"RORY: That you approve."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes. [Both chuckle] You know, it's been a while since I partied like this, I used to be much better at it."
"RORY: Well, maybe Logan can give you some tips when he gets back."
"[Cheers and applause as Brian gets on stage.]"
"BRIAN: Hi. I'm Brian Fuller, bass player for Hep Alien and best man. All right, I want to say a few words about Zach. I've known Zach for most of my life. I've been his roommate and friend, and I just have to say, I think Lane has something very, very wrong with her."
"ZACH: Boo!"
"RORY: Time for the toast. Excuse me a minute."
"CHRISTOPHER: Absolutely."
"LORELAI: [Walks up with a tray] We are doing shots."
"CHRISTOPHER: For 20, apparently."
"LORELAI: Pass the salt."
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, you know, I'm a respectable man, Lorelai, an upstanding citizen, I'm a father."
"LORELAI: I know. This is how you became one."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, you got me there."
"BRIAN: In closing, Lane, if you ever want to see a picture of Zach trying to shove 14 ping-pong balls in his mouth, I have it. To Lane and Zach, may they stay together forever... otherwise, Hep Alien is screwed."
"CROWD: To Lane and Zach!"
"LORELAI: To Lane and Zach!"
"CHRISTOPHER: To Lane and Zach!"
"[As they take shots]"
"LANE: Great toast, Bri."
"ZACH: Yes, excellent. Seriously, dude, I need those pictures back."
"RORY: Hi, everyone, I'm Rory Gilmore. I'm the maid of honor."
"LORELAI: To Rory!"
"CHRISTOPHER: To Rory!"
"[More shots]"
"RORY: I'm not one for speeches, and I don't have any incriminating pictures of Lane, but I do have this letter."
"CROWD: Ooh!"
"RORY: This letter was written in 1995 by one Lane Kim. It was slipped into my hands during a spelling test in Miss Mellon's class. I was so shocked by its contents that I missed the word automobile -- o-t-t-o-mobile. [Zach is thinking about the spelling] That's right, Lane. I remember. I will now share with you the contents of this letter. ""Dear Rory, how was your lunch? ""Mine was bad. Did you have ham again? ""If you did, I am sorry, but mine was worse. ""I thought you should know that today at recess ""I decided that I'm going to marry Alex Backus. ""He has a very nice head, ""and his ears don't stick out like Ronnie Winston's do. ""I will love him forever, no matter what. See you at brownies. Love, Lane."" I'm sorry Lane I just thought that Zach should know that in your heart, he will always be second place to Alex Backus and his well-proportioned ears."
"LANE: It's true."
"LORELAI: Come on, you're behind. [Still Drinking]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, I'm gonna sit this one out."
"LORELAI: Well that's fun."
"RORY: But the bottom line is, I love you, Lane. Congratulations. To the bride and groom."
"LORELAI: To the bride and groom!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Bride and groom! [They take another sh*t] Where you going?"
"LORELAI: I want to give a toast."
"RORY: [Hugging Lane] Congratulations."
"[On stage, Lorelai bumps into the bands stuff]"
"LORELAI: [Sounding drunk] Hello. Everybody, hello. Some of you know me as Lorelai Gilmore, and some of you know me as Cher. But either way, I wanted to say a few words about our girl. I have known Lane forever, and I'm just so incredibly happy that she has gotten married. I mean, I am just so happy that this adorable 22-year-old girl has gotten married, because it's amazing, you know? It's really hard to get married. Believe me, I should know. [Rory looks on worried and looks to Chris, who is also worried.] I mean, seriously, because Lane is married, and next thing, it'll be my daughter, and then my granddaughter, but not me. I'm not getting married. No, it ain't for me. It's not in the cards. But, hey, do you know what date I'm not getting married? June 3rd. [Rory getting more worried] Do not save the date. Do you hear me? Do whatever you want on June 3rd, because there's nothing at all happening on that day. If there's anything you need to book or anything, it's totally safe to book it on June 3rd. [Chris gets up and goes to Rory] So, congratulations, Lane and Zach. Who else here had eight shots of Tequila? Anybody? Hands...no? Oh, my gosh, who misses the yummy bartenders? I know, me too. They were so great. I was gonna ask them to not work on June 3rd on my not wedding. I just thought that would be so fun. [Chris and Rory come on stage] Hi, Chris. Hi, Rory."
"RORY: How about some coffee?"
"LORELAI: What? Okay. Well, I guess we're going over here."
"ZACH: Totally perfect wedding. [Lane and Zach kiss]"
"LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"RORY: Get her over to the couch."
"CHRISTOPHER: Man, I must say, when your mom does something, she commits."
"RORY: Just prop her up. I'm gonna make some coffee."
"CHRISTOPHER: You know hon, if the two gallons we poured down her throat at the wedding didn't do anything, I'm not sure what two more cups will."
"RORY: Hey no one knows how to wrangle the powers of coffee like a Gilmore. Just prop her up. She hates to get pillow face."
"CHRISTOPHER: Pillow face. Got it."
"RORY: [cell phone rings] Hello?"
"[Rory comes in the living room]"
"RORY: Logan's hurt."
"CHRISTOPHER: What, what do you mean? Is he all right?"
"RORY: I don't know. That was Colin and the line was bad. Something happened on their trip. They're airlifting him to a hospital in New York."
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh boy!"
"RORY: I got to go. I want to be there when he arrives."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes, go. I can take care of your mom."
"RORY: Leave her a note that I'll call her from the hospital."
"CHRISTOPHER: I will. Go. [Sighs] All right, Calamity Jane, let's get you to bed."
"LORELAI: [Groans] No."
"CHRISTOPHER: Yes."
"[Cut to later that night in the bed room, Lorelai is asleep in her clothes and Chris is asleep in a chair, the phone rings]"
"LORELAI: [Half asleep] Hello?… Hi. What time is it? [Sighs] Yeah. I, uh...um...[Sees Chris] no, Luke, it's fine. I'm glad you called. [Sighs] Uh-huh. [Sighs and waves to Chris as he leaves.] Yep, the wedding was great. She looked beautiful."

"SOOKIE: No."
"LORELAI: I want there to be. There's an effect. I need a cause."
"SOOKIE: The cause was 10 giant shots of Tequila, sweetie."
"LORELAI: It makes me woozy just hearing that."
"SOOKIE: That's the price you pay for being the hit of Lane's wedding."
"LORELAI: Hit? I was a raving lunatic. And that toast…[A pan bangs on the counter] Oh, my god! Loudest sound ever."
"FRED: Sorry."
"SOOKIE: Don't worry about the toast. And you weren't a lunatic. You were a character. What is Stars Hollow if not a haven for colorful characters? I mean you're not up there with Stevie the pantsless Santa Claus or Jojo the cow whisperer, but you made some strides."
"LORELAI: Is this supposed to be a consolation? [More pan bangs] That's twice in 20 seconds, Fred."
"FRED: Sorry."
"SOOKIE: I've seen you wasted before but never like this. I mean we had you guzzling coffee, but coffee was making you energetically wasted."
"LORELAI: I should borrow the reception video to see what a fool I made out of myself."
"SOOKIE: And check out your audition."
"LORELAI: My what? [Bangs the pans again] You want a piece of me, omelet boy?"
"SOOKIE: Fred why don't you let the vegetables simmer for a while? I'll look after them."
"FRED: Sure, Sookie."
"LORELAI: Sorry, Fred. I'm not myself this morning. [Small Laugh] So, now, what did I do in front of the camera?"
"SOOKIE: Well when you spotted the videographer, you got suddenly very excited to film your audition tape for ""America's Next Top Model."""
"LORELAI: Oh, my god!"
"SOOKIE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: I thought that was a dream."
"SOOKIE: It wasn't."
"LORELAI: The posing, the strutting, the inappropriate gyrating?"
"SOOKIE: All caught on video and several of Zach's buddies' camera phones."
"LORELAI: Why didn't you stop me?"
"SOOKIE: I tried, we all tried, but you were on a mission. You kept saying, ""I'm not here to make friends. I want to win."" And then after that…"
"LORELAI: There's an ""after that""?"
"SOOKIE: You tried to start a limbo contest, a poker game, and a secret club for ""supercool party people"" only. None of those really you know took off, especially the limbo, considering your choice of limbo stick was Zach's …"
"LORELAI AND SOOKIE: [Together] Great-uncle's cane."
"LORELAI: Oh, yeah, is he okay?"
"SOOKIE: He stumbled, but we caught him. He's fine."
"LORELAI: So, is that all? Anything else I need to know about?"
"SOOKIE: Nope, after you crowned yourself Arm-Wrestling Champion of the world, Christopher and Rory scooped you up and got you home. He got you in bed okay?"
"LORELAI: Christopher? Yeah. Well he and Rory."
"SOOKIE: He's very ""knight in shining armor,"" very chivalrous."
"LORELAI: That's him…So um, is there anything else I did that I need to know about? I want to be fully informed."
"SOOKIE: I told you everything."
"LORELAI: Good! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go and be nauseous out front for a while."
"SOOKIE: Excellent. [Chant] Supercool party people bid you supercool adieu! [Lorelai looks at Sookie] That's how you were saying goodbye to people."
"LORELAI: Super."

"NURSE 2: He was just transferred out of the I.C.U., Room 713."
"RORY: How is he?"
"NURSE 2: Are you family?"
"RORY: I'm his girlfriend."
"NURSE 2: All I can tell you is that he's not conscious right now and that he's in serious but stable condition."
"RORY: What does that mean, ""serious but stable""?"
"NURSE 2: Just what it says."
"RORY: But is it more serious or stable? Which way is it leaning?"
"NURSE 2: I'm sorry I can only release more information to family members."

"COLIN: Had to deduct .3 for all the screaming and bleeding."
"RORY: What about his family, did you talk to them?"
"COLIN: Honor is on her honeymoon in Mykonos, trying to get back, and Logan's mom checked herself into some sort of spa in Arizona the moment she heard."
"FINN: When the going gets tough, the tough get hot-rock massages."
"RORY: What about Mitchum?"
"FINN: The ""Dark Lord"" we left word but haven't heard anything."
"COLIN: But we've come up with a plan to get around the whole ""family only gets information"" thing. We're adopting him."
"RORY: What?"
"FINN: [Joking] Logan will make a fine son."
"COLIN: Of course, first we must be married."
"FINN: Naturally, darling. I'm very old-fashioned."
"COLIN: And even then, adopting as a gay couple is never easy."
"FINN: We just want to give love."
"COLIN: Oh, Finn."
"FINN: Oh, buttercup."
"RORY: What the hell is wrong with you two? Your best friend is lying unconscious in a hospital, and you don't even care."
"FINN: [Taken back] Rory…"
"RORY: Why the hell aren't you two lying unconscious in there, huh?"
"COLIN: [Quite] Come on…"
"RORY: You don't care, because if you did, you wouldn't be like this. You couldn't. You're supposed have his back you're supposed to watch out for each other on these stupid trips of yours.

"RORY: But, well, he's out of the I.C.U., So that's good, right? They wouldn't have moved him up here unless he was recovering."
"DR SCHULTZ: Sorry, really."
"RORY: But he's had surgery, right? Does he need more surgery? Does he have broken bones, because I can donate blood if you want."
"DR SCHULTZ: Miss."
"RORY: You really, you can't tell me anything about what he has or what you've done or what's wrong, anything?"

"CAESAR: Hmm."
"LUKE: What?"
"CAESAR: It's just that while I was running the place, that was one of my innovations, cold bananas. People really love them."
"LUKE: I highly doubt that. [pointing] And get rid of those scones."
"CAESAR: You know that's something else I wanted to talk to you about, Luke."
"LUKE: What?"
"CAESAR: See your attitude. While I was running the place, people really responded to my sunny demeanor. Customers find you cold and distant. Service with a smile, it's a cliché for a reason."
"LUKE: Yeah, look, Caesar, I don't want to improve things, and I don't want to stop being cold to customers. I want you to keep my damn bananas out of the damn fridge, and I want to keep my damn doughnuts in the damn doughnut case. Can you do that for me!"

"LORELAI: Oh, it's adorable. Look, Patty, an Amish voodoo doll."
"MISS PATTY: I love it. Hey, Luke, I'm still waiting on my cold banana."
"LUKE: We don't serve cold bananas. [To Lorelai] It's not a voodoo doll. It's just a doll the Amish don't put faces on their dolls or pins in them."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, it's my doll now. What the Amish don't know won't hurt them. Unless, of course, I want to hurt them."
"LUKE: It's yours to do with what you will."
"LORELAI: You seem surprisingly rested after all you've been through."
"LUKE: Yeah the kids were okay. They seemed to like me, unless they were all lying."
"LORELAI: Kids never lie."
"LUKE: And April and I finally got into a good rhythm. She was tolerating me pretty good at the end."
"LORELAI: Good."
"LUKE: And guess what it's her birthday tomorrow, and I'm throwing her a party."
"LORELAI: You're kidding. How did that happen?"
"LUKE: Well I was dropping her off this morning, and her mom mentioned to me that she was taking her to her grandmother's to celebrate, and she couldn't swing a party here with her friends, so I figured I know her friends now. I got a great place to hold a party."
"LORELAI: Yeah, where?"
"LUKE: Here."
"LORELAI: Oh."
"LUKE: So, anyhow, there you go."
"LORELAI: Look at you, diving into fatherhood."
"LUKE: I'm doing my best."
"LORELAI: So, tomorrow, huh? You prepared for all that?"
"LUKE: Sure. Why?"
"LORELAI: Well if you need a consultant, I have thrown some rockin' preteen parties in my time. Of course, I didn't have a deep fryer but…"
"LUKE: I think I can handle it. I'll put up some decorations. I've ordered some balloons. I got a great cake place. There'll be presents."
"LORELAI: All good. I'm just saying that Rory's birthday scavenger hunt of 1998 is still talked about in hushed, reverent tones."
"LUKE: Is that the one where all the kids ended up at Taylor's at 11:00 at night stealing stuff out of his fridge?"
"LORELAI: Shh! Hushed, reverent tones."
"LUKE: I've got it all under control. Excuse me. What can I get you, Kirk?"
"KIRK: How about a steaming cup of chicory coffee?"
"LUKE: It's not on the menu, Kirk."
"KIRK: I know. It's on the sign."
"LUKE: [Takes the sign down] That's a mistake."
"KIRK: Well, now all I can think about is chicory coffee. I'm very susceptible to signage."
"LUKE: Well, come back when you're susceptible to ordering off the menu.[Too Lorelai] You want anything?"
"LORELAI: How about a nice plate of chicken fingers?"
"LUKE: Oh. [Takes down the sign] Why don't I start you off with some coffee, hmm?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no, thanks. I'm kind of coffee'd out."
"LUKE: Oh, right. Battling the hangover."
"LORELAI: [A little surprised] Oh. Did I mention my hangover?"
"LUKE: No, patty filled me in, you know. The tequila shots, you taking the mike."
"LORELAI: Taking the mike. Uh, yeah. I, um, I really didn't know what I was saying, just empty, meaningless words you know tumbling out of my mouth."
"LUKE: I hear you really belted it out."
"LORELAI: Belted it out?"
"LUKE: ""Endless love."""
"MISS PATTY: The song, honey. Ohh...yeah. [Laughing] Oh, yes. I really belted it out. Is there any other way to sing ""endless love""? You know if you're not gonna really belt it out, you might as well stay in your seat."
"MISS PATTY: She sang it beautifully."
"LUKE: Yeah everybody does embarrassing stuff at weddings."
"LORELAI: Yeah, right, true."
"LUKE: Be right back."
"MISS PATTY: Okay, I've already gotten to the whole town, and they're all telling the ""endless love"" story. He'll never know."
"LORELAI: Oh, thanks. I owe you, patty."
"MISS PATTY: Oh honey, please. I've given more drunken toasts than Colin Farrell. You owe me nothing."
"LORELAI: Thanks, patty. [Playing with the engagement ring]"
"MISS PATTY: That Luke… It may take a mule team, but you're getting him to the altar someday."
"LORELAI: Yeah, someday. [Sighs]"
"HOSPITAL"
"[Rory gets her phone out to make a call]"
"WOMAN ON P.A.: Dr. Valentino to the O.R., Please."
"[Cut to Paris's apartment]"
"PARIS: What?"
"RORY: Paris?"
"PARIS: Larry summers is right, Rory. Our university system is crumbling. Did you know that."
"RORY: Paris. I just found out my microbiology final is an open-book exam. Can you believe that? I mean why not just have our professors take it for us? Or better yet, they can just hand us our diplomas the moment we step on campus freshman year, along with some government cheese, a bong, and a t-shirt that says ""hard work is for suckers."""
"RORY: Paris, I'm at the hospital with Logan."
"PARIS: Why what happened?"
"RORY: He and his buddies went on some life and death brigade trip, and they parachuted off a cliff in Costa Rica, and he had a really bad fall."
"PARIS: Is he okay?"
"RORY: I don't know. He's out of the I.C.U., So I guess that's a good thing. They said he's in serious but stable condition, but they won't tell me anything else because I'm not family."
"PARIS: Is he breathing on his own?"
"RORY: Yeah, I mean, I think so."
"PARIS: Well what's his pallor? Is he peaked? Was there internal bleeding?"
"RORY: I have no idea. I quickly scribbled down some things off his chart. Um, you're pre-med can I read it to you, maybe you can make some sense of it."
"PARIS: Forget it I don't know how to read charts yet. I can tell you everything you wanna know about the difference between recessive and dominant eye-color genes in fruit flies, but god forbid I learn how to read a chart before I'm a fourth-year surgical resident."
"RORY: Great."
"PARIS: What hospital is he in?"
"RORY: Columbia-Presbyterian, Manhattan."
"PARIS: Who's the attending?"
"RORY: Paris it doesn't matter they're not gonna release information to non-family."
"PARIS: Just give me the name."
"RORY: Dr. Schultz."
"PARIS: I'll call you right back."
"RORY: Paris."
"[Paris hangs up, Rory watches as a nurse takes a phone call, we can just make out the conversation]"
"NURSE: Miss please! [getting mad] That language is certainly not necessary! Hold on. {handing the phone over] Dr. Schultz It's about Logan Huntzberger."
"DR SCHULTZ: This is Dr. Schuzltz. No, that's not possible. Well, you wouldn't do that. Listen, miss… fine. Paging dr. Bender. Paging dr. Bender, please. [After a few seconds he hangs up and looks b*at.]"
"RORY: [Rory's cell phone rings] Hello?"
"PARIS: Here the deal, he was bleeding internally when they brought him in, and they were worried about the oxygen levels in his blood, but he's stabilized now, and they're back up to normal, so that's no longer a concern. He was also running a high fever, so they put him on mondo doses of intravenous antibiotics. He has a partially collapsed lung..."
"RORY: oh, my god!"
"PARIS: ...Six broken ribs, a broken ankle, torn cartilage in both knees, and a severe concussion. He had surgery for the lung, and that went well. They did a Thoracoscopy, which is a couple of small incisions in the chest. [Rory looks worried] Then they put a tube into the lung to drain the fluid from the pleural space so the lung can re-expand. That's way less invasive than a Thoracotomy. Which is a similar operation but for that one, they have to butterfly you like a shrimp. And that's it."
"RORY: So, what does this mean?"
"PARIS: It means he's out of immediate danger. He's young and healthy and they expect him to make a full recovery."
"RORY: Really? Like a full recovery, like he's going to recover fully?"
"PARIS: That's what the doctor told me. He's need some rehab he won't be running, dancing, or jumping off a cliff anytime soon, but, yeah, he should be fine. He's a very lucky guy. Those guys are idiots."
"RORY: Wow"
"PARIS: Yeah"
"RORY: Thank you so much for this. Really, Paris, thank you."
"PARIS: It was fun. Anything else?"
"RORY: No, I feel a lot better."
"PARIS: Call me if you need anything else."
"RORY: I will."
"STREET – UNKNOWN LOCATION"
"[Luke and Lorelai are walking on the side walk]"
"LORELAI: So, you all shopped out?"
"LUKE: I got a couple more stores in me."
"LORELAI: You know you would make the best Sherpa and the hottest. You could move to Nepal, open your own hot-Sherpa shop, and make a fortune."
"LUKE: Well this is fun for me. Besides I'd like to think I have some influence on what you buy."
"LORELAI: You do?"
"LUKE: I don't?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"LUKE: Yes, I do."
"LORELAI: No, you don't."
"LUKE: I do."
"LORELAI: You don't."
"LUKE: But you're always asking my opinion."
"LORELAI: Yeah, but it's the way I ask. ""Isn't this adorable?"" Or ""this isn't right, right?"" You know I put your answer right there in the question."
"LUKE: Oh."
"LORELAI: I will say, I do always like to buy one thing that you like that I don't 'cause I know it makes you happy, like that blouse."
"LUKE: You don't like that, I thought you liked that."
"LORELAI: Not really, but I liked how much you liked it, so I bought it."
"LUKE: Huh."
"LORELAI: And I will wear it because I know that every time I do, you'll notice and appreciate it, and that will make me feel so good. And then because I feel so good, I'll start wearing it more and more, and I'll eventually really grow to like it, and I'll forget that I didn't like it in the first place. And holy crap, you've picked out all my favorite clothes."
"LUKE: I knew it. [pointing to a window display] Hey what do you think of that?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: The toiletry kit."
"LORELAI: What? And throw away the 5-year-old Dixie cup you use to hold your toothbrush? It's historical."
"LUKE: I mean as a birthday present for April."
"LORELAI: April who?"
"LUKE: Come on, it's cute."
"LORELAI: Um, yeah. I don't think it's quite right."
"LUKE: It's girly. It's got cats on it."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, if it's got cats on it…"
"LUKE: April likes cats."
"LORELAI: [small laugh] Yeah, but it's a toiletry kit. It's so hygienic."
"LUKE: I saw her use soap on the trip."
"LORELAI: Yeah did you see her tie her shoelaces? 'Cause you could get her shoelaces."
"LUKE: I think she'll like it."
"LORELAI: Luke, it's weird. It says, ""happy birthday, now go clean yourself up."""
"LUKE: If she doesn't like it, I'll get her a follow-up gift."
"LORELAI: Why not just get her the perfect gift right up front?"
"LUKE: Why couldn't that be the perfect gift? You don't know."
"LORELAI: I know girls. It's not the right gift. Hey, you know there's a store, a few blocks down that has great stuff. I could take you there and show you 50 things I know she'd like. Some of them may even have cats on them."
"LUKE: I think I'm gonna get that."
"LORELAI: Come on Luke I can really help you here."
"LUKE: I'm not saying you can't, I know you're an expert, but I need to do this."
"LORELAI: Then do it. I'm just saying, let me be part of it."
"LUKE: No."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"LUKE: Because it's too soon."
"LORELAI: Why is it too soon?"
"LUKE: Because the minute you get involved in her life, it'll be all over for me."
"LORELAI: What that's ridiculous."
"LUKE: No, it's not ridiculous. You're colorful and funny. You're practically a cartoon character. Kids love you. I wouldn't hang out with me either after meeting you."
"LORELAI: Luke!"
"LUKE: She'll like you better. That is just a fact."
"LORELAI: No, you're her dad."
"LUKE: Yes, I am her dad, and this is the way I want it to be."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"LUKE: I'll be a couple of minutes."
"LORELAI: [Looking a little mad] I'll be right here."
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[April's birthday party, the diner is full of girls April's age.]"
"ANNA: So you have my cell phone if there's any problems?"
"LUKE: I've got your cell number, your store number, your store fax number, your home numbers. You are 100% reachable."
"ANNA: Good."
"LUKE: And, hey, thanks again for letting me do this."
"ANNA: Oh, please. She's excited about this. Plus, your chaperoning got rave reviews."
"LUKE: Really?"
"ANNA: April said you were the least-embarrassing parent on the trip."
"LUKE: Good, that's good, right?"
"ANNA: It's a rave. Her friends call you Hagrid."
"LUKE: Really? Hagrid. Wow. [Clears his throat] I don't know what that means."
"ANNA: He's a character from ""Harry Potter"", very big, very hairy, very lovable. It's a huge compliment."
"LUKE: Oh I will take your word for it."
"ANNA: So, I'm gonna go now. Have fun, and I'll talk to you later tonight."
"LUKE: Will do."
"ANNA: I'm going, April."
"APRIL: [Busy with her friends] Yeah, yeah, bye, mom."
"ANNA: That was from the heart."
"LUKE: Totally. [They both laugh]"
"ANNA: Bye again. And the diner looks really great. I was here when you opened it, remember?"
"LUKE: I remember."
"ANNA: Bye."
"[Closes the door for Anna]"
"LUKE: Okay, can I get everyone's attention for a moment here? Just go ahead and pull your chairs around so everyone can see me."
"GIRL 1: Is this a game?"
"LUKE: No, no games right now. Just gather. All right, I'm Luke. Some of you know me. I'm April's dad. [Cheers and applause form the girls.] So, um, before we get the party started, I just wanted to lay down some ground rules, some simple dos and don'ts. so that everybody has a good time and goes home in one piece. Okay. [Clears throat ] So, this is the party area. You are to remain in the party area at all times. The kitchen is strictly off limits. Under no circumstances are you to enter the kitchen. It's incredibly dangerous back there. [The girls look a little worried] One turn of the wrong dial, you could burn your face off. And I've got so many knives back there, you so much as trip, you could lose an arm. You could chop off a bunch off fingers. You could poke out an eye. And do not go upstairs. That is not part of the party area. Everyone must remain in the party area at all times. And finally, do not go outside. I will not give anybody permission to go outside, okay? Are we clear?"
"GIRLS: All right. Yes, sir."
"LUKE: Then that's all I've got. So have fun."
"APRIL: Uh-huh."
"GIRLS: [Asking April] Is he serious?"
"DRAGONFLY INN – RECEPTION AREA"
"LORELAI: Is that our website?"
"MICHEL: It is."
"LORELAI: What happened to it?"
"MICHEL: I made some modifications."
"LORELAI: It's just a big picture of you."
"MICHEL: Well I figured since I'm the one who put the website together and I'm the one continuously updating the website, then I should be featured prominently on the website."
"LORELAI: Featured? Sure. But where's the inn? All I see is your face."
"MICHEL: Aha! But if you want to hear about the inn, you click on my mouth. And if you want pictures of the inn, you click on my eyes. And if you want to post something about the inn, you click on my ears. Clever, no?"
"LORELAI: You want to argue about this now or later?"
"MICHEL: Later. I'm having too much fun."
"LORELAI: [cell phone rings] Hello."
"RORY: It's me."
"LORELAI: Hey, how is he?"
"RORY: Well, I'm told he's going to be fine, but he looks awful, and he's been unconscious the whole time I've been here. It's really scary."
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"RORY: He basically jumped off a cliff, and his parachute barely opened."
"LORELAI: Oh my God!"
"RORY: Yeah, he has six broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a broken ankle, contusions over 1/3 of his body, and a concussion."
"LORELAI: Wow, who else is there? What other family?"
"RORY: Well Colin and Finn were here, but none of his family's here."
"LORELAI: How did you get all that information? I thought they only allowed family members to…"
"RORY: Paris."
"LORELAI: God love her."
"RORY: I'm sorry I didn't call sooner. I got you messages I've just been so overwhelmed."
"LORELAI: I'm just glad to hear from you. Is there anything I can do, anything you need? It's been a while since I've sent out a care package. You could be up to your eyeballs in mad libs, silly string, malted milk balls."
"RORY: No, I'm good. Colin and Finn went back to new haven to get some stuff for me. And I think I'm just gonna hang out here for a while."
"NURSE: Logan is awake if you want to see him."
"RORY: Oh mom, Logan's awake."
"LORELAI: Okay call me if there's anything you need."
"RORY: Thanks bye."
"LORELAI: Bye."
"HOSPITAL"
"[Rory walks into Logan's room]"
"WOMAN ON P.A.: Dr. Morris, dial 102, please."
"RORY: Hey."
"LOGAN: Hey."
"RORY: You're awake."
"LOGAN: Or hallucinating, pretty good hallucination."
"RORY: Oh, you're awake."
"LOGAN: I must look like crap."
"RORY: Now I know why you never let me see you without makeup."
"LOGAN: I guess maybe base jumping with very little preparation wasn't the hottest idea."
"RORY: You're gonna be fine, you're gonna make a full recovery."
"LOGAN: Hey Robocop made a full recovery. Look where that led him."
"RORY: This is the best hospital in the city, and the best hospital in New York city is basically the best hospital in the country, and that's basically the best hospital in the world, so all in all, you're in the best place you could be, all things considered."
"LOGAN: [Groans]"
"RORY: Hey, what do you think you're doing? Lay down."
"LOGAN: [Sighs] I'm really sorry about this."
"RORY: It's okay."
"LOGAN: No, it's not okay. I was showing off. I knew it wasn't safe from that cliff. I was so drunk, I was lucky I pulled my chute at all."
"RORY: But you're going to be fine, and I will be here as long as you want me to be. I've located the gift shop and the good cafeteria, ""good"" being a relative term, and the maternity ward, in case I want to play a little practical joke, swap the newborns around."
"LOGAN: What about the paper, school?"
"RORY: I have my laptop. I can stay on top of my schoolwork. And Bill can run the paper for a while."
"LOGAN: I don't want you to fall behind, miss too many classes. You already have more than enough to do without having to see me…"
"RORY: Shh. Logan, just relax. Get some rest. I'll be here."
"LOGAN: I'm glad."
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[It's very quite, the girls are playing in groups]"
"LUKE: So, how we doing? We having fun?"
"GIRL: [very quite] Yeah."
"APRIL: Marcia, you have to discard."
"MARCIA: I know, but you only need one card, and I don't want to give it to you."
"APRIL: What makes you think I only need one card?"
"MARCIA: Oh please you pick up a card and discard like every half-second. It's so obvious."
"APRIL: Well, it's my birthday. Why don't you just give me the stupid card I want?"
"LUKE: Hey, how do you think the temperature is?"
"APRIL: It's fine, I guess."
"LUKE: Are you cold? Maybe it's too cold in here. How many people are cold, huh? Anyone too warm? Okay, well, good to know."
"LAURA: Luke."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LAURA: can I go to the bathroom?"
"LUKE: Of course. You don't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom."
"LAURA: But it's in the restricted area. I could lose a finger."
"LUKE: Oh well, the bathroom is not part of the restricted area. I didn't mean to include that. Does anyone else have to go to the bathroom? [They all raise there hands] Ah, well, all right. Well, let's line up, okay? You can use the bathroom one at a time. Laura, you first."
"LAURA: Thank you."
"LUKE: Uh, I'll be right out. I just have to check on something in the back."
"DRAGONFLY INN – RECEPTION AREA"
"[Lorelai is working on the computer.]"
"LORELAI: [Phone rings] Mmrr [She answers the phone] Dragonfly inn."
"LUKE: It's a disaster."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: The party, it's a total disaster."
"LORELAI: [sounding excited almost pleased] A disaster, why?"
"LUKE: Nothing is happening it's like a funeral hall in there. I didn't know 13-year-old girls could be so unhappy."
"LORELAI: Where are you? I don't hear anything."
"LUKE: I'm in the storage room. I come in here and hide a lot."
"LORELAI: And leaving them unsupervised?"
"LUKE: Well, there's a peephole here I can see out of."
"LORELAI: You're peeping at the girls from the storage room?"
"LUKE: I do not have time for any weird jokes."
"LORELAI: Okay what are they doing?"
"LUKE: [Goes back to the peep hole] Well, April was playing cards. Some of the others were reading and playing video games. At the moment, they're all just waiting to go to the bathroom."
"LORELAI: You didn't plan any activities?"
"LUKE: It's a birthday party. I thought that was the activity."
"LORELAI: Oh, Luke."
"LUKE: Is it normal for kids to fall asleep at a birthday party?"
"LORELAI: Luke listen are you listening?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"LORELAI: Go upstairs and get your clock radio."
"LUKE: Why, so we can watch the minutes of the world's worst birthday party tick off one by one?"
"LORELAI: No, go get it, bring it downstairs and put on some music, KC101. I'll be right over."
"LUKE: [sounding a little panicked] You're coming here?"
"LORELAI: Just stall for time, I have some things to finish up, and then I'll come over, if it's okay?"
"LUKE: What!"
"LORELAI: Is it okay that I come over?"
"LUKE: Yes, Lorelai, come! Hurry!"
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll hurry."
"LUKE: Hurry faster or they might start leaving."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye."
"LUKE'S DINER - EXTERIOR"
"[Luke goes out to meet Lorelai.]"
"LORELAI: Hey."
"LUKE: So, it got worse after we hung up."
"LORELAI: You get the radio?"
"LUKE: No I forgot the radio part was broken, and the buzzer alarm went off at one point. There was a slight up tick in the mood but that didn't last long. I think it's too late."
"LORELAI: It's not too late."
"LUKE: I swear I heard the word ""mutiny"" bandied around in their."
"LORELAI: It's not too late. Let's get in there."
"LUKE: But where's the stuff?"
"LORELAI: What stuff?"
"LUKE: The party stuff."
"LORELAI: Oh, my god, I left the circus elephants in my car, and I didn't crack a window."
"LUKE: But seriously where's the party stuff?"
"LORELAI: Come on follow my lead."
""
""
""
"[cut to inside the diner]"
"LORELAI: Hey, everybody. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. Thank you so much for your patience. I'm really glad you guys waited to start the party until I got here."
"LUKE: Oh, um, that's okay, Lorelai. We didn't mind, right, girls?"
"LORELAI: Great. Okay, let's get this party started. Where's the birthday girl?"
"APRIL: Here."
"LORELAI: April Nardini, front and center. You know, I met you briefly. You were filling salt and pepper shakers."
"APRIL: I remember you were dressed in all black, and you had really blue eyes. They aren't quite as blue today. But I think that's just the light thing."
"LORELAI: These irises are all natural, baby. All right, everybody, line up single file behind us."
"APRIL: We already went to the bathroom."
"LORELAI: Oh I know this is going to be so much better, now take the hand of the person in front of you and the person in back of you. Luke, you pull up the rear. I'll take the lead."
"LUKE: Sure, what is this?"
"LORELAI: Just follow me, everybody. No matter what, do not let go of either hand."
"GIRL 1: We're not allowed to go outside."
"GIRL 2: Or in the kitchen."
"GIRL 3: Or anywhere else."
"LORELAI: What?"
"LUKE: You are now, girls. We got new rules."
"APRIL: Should we bring our stuff?"
"LORELAI: No, leave it. We'll be back."
"LUKE: Alright everybody try to walk at the same pace. You step on somebody's heels, you could break an ankle. And watch out for the traffic, not just cars, but bikes. People in this town ride their bikes like maniacs."
"LORELAI: Luke!"
"LUKE: Sorry."
"[cut to outside as they make there way up the side walk.]"
"LORELAI: Oh, check for traffic. Always check. And go!"
"GIRL 1: Where are we going?"
"GIRL 2: No idea!"
"LORELAI: Serpentine, girls, serpentine."
"LUKE: Is this wise to serpentine?"
"LORELAI: No!"
"[They enter the beauty shop]"
"GIRLS: [Giggling ]"
"LESLIE: Hi, Lorelai."
"ALISON: Hi."
"LORELAI: Hi"
"Hey, girls."
"LORELAI: Ah, alright, I'd like you to meet the birthday girl."
"ALISON: Hi, April."
"LESLIE: Happy birthday."
"APRIL: Hello."
"LESLIE: You are adorable."
"LORELAI: Alright girls I want you each to take a basket and fill it up. I want you to pick anything you want because today we're getting makeovers."
"GIRLS: [Screaming]"
"LORELAI: These two ladies are here to help you in any way you need. That's Alison and Leslie."
"GIRLS: [Wave and say ""Hi""]"
"LORELAI: On your mark, get set, and shop!"
"GIRLS: [Giggling as the girls start to fill there baskets.]"
"LUKE: You're a genius."
"LORELAI: Well 13-year-old girls and makeup, it's like betting on secretariat."
"LUKE: Never in a million years would I have thought of something like this."
"LORELAI: That's why I'm the Yin to your Yang, the Emack to your Bolio. [Too the girls] Hey, who wants hot-pink highlights?"
"GIRLS: Oh, me!"
"HOSPITAL"
"[Rory Is talking on he cell phone]"
"RORY: I hate that you're cutting your honeymoon short."
"HONOR: It okay, with mom flaking out, I don't want to be here anymore. We've got seats on a flight tonight, but it's got a 5-hour layover, in Ankara so we're trying to find something more direct. Either way we should be there sometime tomorrow night."
"RORY: Okay. So, have you heard anything more from your dad?"
"HONOR: Yeah, I just talked to him."
"RORY: Is he coming down here?"
"HONOR: Nope."
"RORY: He's out of town, too?"
"HONOR: No, he's home. He's just not coming."
"RORY: What?"
"HONOR: It's the life and death brigade thing. He's very against it."
"RORY: But he was in the life and death brigade."
"HONOR: Yes, but he feels that he knew when to grow up and accept responsibility and that Logan doesn't. He wanted his precious boy done with that by now, so he's boycotting."
"RORY: He's boycotting his injured son? Logan had emergency surgery."
"HONOR: Hypocrisy runs very deep in the Huntzberger family. Anyhow, forget it. I'm sure Logan isn't expecting him. Okay so, I'll call later when I have more flight information."
"RORY: Okay, bye."
"WOMAN ON P.A.: Dr. Davis, telephone, please. Dr. Davis, telephone, please."
"[Rory gets out a 2nd cell phone, Logan's]"
"RORY: Mitchum Huntzberger? Yes, it's Rory Gilmore. I just thought I'd call and remind you that Logan is lying in a hospital bed with a partially collapsed lung and a whole host of other potentially life-threatening injuries. And I'm figuring a guy like you, surrounded by nothing but a bunch of terrified sycophants might not have someone in his life with the guts to tell him what an incredibly selfish, narcissistic ass he's being, so I thought I'd jump on in. Swallow your pride, get in your car, and come down here and see your son, now!"
"LUKE'S DINER – NIGHT TIME"
"[The party is much better]"
"LORELAI: That looks excellent. [Gasps] Marcia, fabulous. You look like Sophia Loren."
"MARCIA: I was going for Vanessa Minnillo on MTV."
"LORELAI: Ah, I love her music."
"MARCIA: She's a V.J."
"LORELAI: No well you didn't let me finish I love her music-video introductions. You know She's so smooth and classy. Luke, more chips here."
"LUKE: Coming."
"GIRL: Lorelai, check this out."
"LORELAI: Ooh, cool. Your eyes have eyes."
"GIRL: Freaky right."
"LORELAI: Yes you could fall asleep in class, and no one would know."
"APRIL: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Oh, April, you look beautiful."
"APRIL: Leslie says I have excellent bone structure."
"LORELAI: Yes well, I agree with her."
"APRIL: So it's not weird when someone compliments your skull?"
"LORELAI: A woman takes any compliment that comes her way."
"APRIL: Got it, hey did you do that glitter heart on your cheek?"
"LORELAI: Happens to be my handiwork yeah you want one?"
"APRIL: Yes."
"LORELAI: All right, sit, sit. Ah what color would you like, pink, blue, purple, florescent green?"
"APRIL: Purple I'm obsessed with purple, probably because I'm obsessed with ""Harold and the Purple Crayon."""
"LORELAI: Hum."
"APRIL: I know I'm too old, but it's still one of my all-time-favorite books."
"LORELAI: That's okay I'm too old for us weekly. It never stopped me."
"APRIL: So, you have a daughter, right?"
"LORELAI: Yes, Rory."
"APRIL: That's good. You'd be wasted on a son."
"LORELAI: I'm gonna take that as a compliment."
"APRIL: It is. You know you remind me of my mom."
"LORELAI: Is she handy with the glitter?"
"APRIL: She painted a mural on my wall in nail polish one night."
"LORELAI: That's cool."
"APRIL: I think you'd like her."
"LORELAI: All right, you're all done."
"APRIL: Thanks."
"[Cut to a little later]"
"APRIL: Oh my God that is so cool, I love it. Thanks, Marcia."
"MARCIA: Your welcome."
"LORELAI: She's loving her presents."
"LUKE: I know."
"APRIL: Okay, how about this one?"
"GIRL 1: It's from your dad."
"GIRL 2: Yeah, open it."
"LUKE: [Sounding a little panicked] You know, you don't have to open up all your presents right away. You could maybe save a few and open them tomorrow, sort of extend the experience."
"GIRL 3: Bad idea, Hagrid."
"APRIL: I don't want to extend the experience."
"LUKE: Wait, is that my gift?"
"LORELAI: It says it's from Luke."
"APRIL: The new ""way things work."" I was gonna get this. And a gift certificate to the discovery store. Thanks, Luke! I love it! [She gets up and hugs Luke] Thank you so much!"
"LUKE: You're welcome. [Too Lorelai] Thank you."
"LORELAI: My pleasure. You know what would really push this party over the top?"
"LUKE: What?"
"LORELAI: If we made it into a sleepover."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"LORELAI: Yeah you've got sleeping bags and blankets."
"LUKE: Plus, I still got Jess' bed. We could stick a couple of them on that."
"LORELAI: Why don't you ask the birthday girl if she wants to do that?"
"LUKE: April, come here a sec."
"APRIL: What's up?"
"LUKE: How would you feel about making this a slumber party?"
"APRIL: Really?"
"LUKE: Really."
"APRIL: [Turns to the girls] Do you guys want to sleep over?"
"GIRLS: That would be really cool."
"LUKE: Great, ah first off, we got to call all your parents to see if it's okay with them. Okay, so with that in mind, why don't we form a single-file line behind here to the phone? [Looks up to see all the girls on their cell phones] Or you could use your own, I guess. [Sighs]"
"LORELAI: Hey So, um, I think I'm gonna take off."
"LUKE: What, no stay. You got to stay."
"LORELAI: Are you sure."
"LUKE: It's a slumber party. You're the slumber-party expert. What does Hagrid know about slumber parties?"
"LORELAI: Would it be weird, the two of us sleeping together?"
"LUKE: You and the girls can sleep upstairs. I'll figure something out."
"LORELAI: Are you sure?"
"LUKE: Yeah absolutely. You have to stay. April would want that."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll stay."
"KIRK: The movie's all ready to go."
"LORELAI: Okay thanks Kirk."
"KIRK: I just need it back for the Weinstein retirement party. Mel Weinstein's a nut for John Hughes movies."
"LORELAI: All right, girls, um, you're about to meet someone very special to me. Her name is Molly Ringwald. Now, I know you don't know who that is, but suffice it to say, she is my generation's Audrey Hepburn. And I know you don't know who that is, either, but trust me, you're gonna love her. And yes, that is the guy from ""Two and a Half Men."" All right, enjoy."
"[The projector starts and The Psychedelic Furs' ""Pretty in Pink"" plays]"
"[Cut to later, Luke is trying to get to sleep, you can here the girls laughing off screen]"
"LUKE: [Sighs]"
"GIRLS: Light as a feather,"
"stiff as a board."
"Light as a feather,"
"stiff as a board."
"Light as a feather,"
"stiff as a board."
"DRAGONFLY INN"
"LORELAI: I forgot how much fun it could be just to put makeup on. You know it's become so pragmatic, such drudgery. It's like all we use it for now is to look better."
"SOOKIE: And why would the two of us ever need to look better?"
"LORELAI: Exactly, whatever happened to the questionably attractive glories of wet 'n' wild blue eye shadow or crimping irons?"
"SOOKIE: Remember sun-in and aqua net and Bonne bell lip smackers? I used to love Bonne bell lip smackers."
"LORELAI: Well who doesn't love a lip gloss that doubles as a necklace? And they smelled so great."
"SOOKIE: Except once, I had the chocolate-fudge-flavored one, and in study hall, Trevor fink ate the whole thing, and then he threw it up all over my copy of ""the red badge of courage."""
"LORELAI: We all had a Trevor fink in our lives."
"SOOKIE: So, it sounds like the party was great."
"LORELAI: It was a great party and a major breakthrough. April's awesome. I think she liked me."
"SOOKIE: I bet she loved you."
"LORELAI: We bonded. And hopefully, things will change and I won't have to hide."
"SOOKIE: Good."
"LORELAI: Yeah Luke just needed that time and space. You know and in hindsight, I think it was good for him, and I'm really glad I let him have it."
"SOOKIE: You were incredibly patient."
"LORELAI: I was, incredibly patient, while at the same time incredibly impatient."
"SOOKIE: You're a complicated woman."
"LORELAI: I am, yes. I try to deny it, but there it is."
"SOOKIE: I'm kind of sad I wasn't at the party. I feel like I missed out."
"LORELAI: I thought you might, so I brought you some leftovers. Bonne bell lip smackers, anyone?"
"SOOKIE: No!"
"LORELAI: Yes! I've got original, glitter gloss, grape crush, and dr. Pepper."
"SOOKIE: I feel like I'm 15 again. [Talking like they are 15] Jackson's so getting under my bra tonight."
"LORELAI: Oh, my god!"
"LUKE'S DINER"
"CUSTOMER: Luke, there's some glitter on my pancakes."
"LUKE: Sorry about that. Let me fix that up for you."
"CAESAR: Wasn't any glitter in the food when I was running the place."
"CUSTOMER: And cut up one of those cold bananas, will you?"
"ANNA: [Too Caesar] Excuse me, is Luke around?"
"CAESAR: Yeah, he's here. He's always here."
"LUKE: Oh hey, Anna, how are you?"
"ANNA: Can we talk in private?"
"LUKE: Uh, sure. This way. Caesar, I'm gonna take a couple minutes."
"CAESAR: Whatever."
"[Cut to the apartment]"
"LUKE: So, what's up?"
"ANNA: I can't believe you did this."
"LUKE: Did what?"
"ANNA: You said you wanted to throw her a party, Luke, you."
"LUKE: I know, I did."
"ANNA: No, you had your girlfriend throw her a party, a girlfriend I don't even know a girlfriend I've never even met. This is not our agreement."
"LUKE: Wow wait a minute I did throw the party. Lorelai was just helping out."
"ANNA: Helping out?"
"LUKE: Yes."
"ANNA: April said you spent the night downstairs."
"LUKE: Yeah well, I spent the night in the storage room. I though it would be a little weird…"
"ANNA: So when you were in the storage room, your girlfriend was upstairs with the girls."
"LUKE: Well yeah."
"ANNA: How am I supposed to explain that to the other girls' parents? How am I supposed to tell them that I left their kids all alone with a woman I've never even met? Who does that!"
"LUKE: I'm sorry. I didn't think that it was gonna cause…"
"ANNA: If I can't trust you, Luke, this arrangement is not gonna work. April is not a sweater that you're borrowing. She's my kid. I have to know where she is and who she's with always."
"LUKE: I know, I'm sorry. You can trust me, I swear."
"ANNA: You know what? I am too mad. I can't even look at you."
"LUKE: Anna."
"HOSPITAL"
"[Rory gets a snack from vending machine, she see Logan's father come in. They exchange looks, Rory points to Logan's room and Mitchum goes in.]"
"Woman on P.A.: Dr. Blair, dr. Blair. Dr. Jay Hamilton, Dr. Jay Hamilton."
"LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Paul Anka (the dog) is sitting on a chair in the kitchen]"
"LUKE: Hello!"
"LORELAI: Ah, Kitchen! Thank god. I am so nutrition-deprived. All I've eaten in the last two days is cake, candy, cookies, and about 10 pounds of flavored lip gloss. [They kiss]"
"LUKE: Well, then, let's eat."
"LORELAI: Good now do you want to be civilized and eat off plates or just right out of the containers? I know you don't approve, but I think there is some sort of origami thing happening with these containers that makes the food taste better in them. It's like Feng Shui for noodles. And I'm not just saying that because I'm lazy and I don't want any cleanup. That's only part of it."
"LUKE: Out of the containers is fine."
"LORELAI: Righteous."
"LUKE: [Sighs]"
"LORELAI: You okay?"
"LUKE: Anna came by the diner."
"LORELAI: Um why? What's up?"
"LUKE: She's mad. She's really mad."
"LORELAI: What about?"
"LUKE: The party."
"LORELAI: Well, the party was a smash."
"LUKE: About you being at the party, she says she feels betrayed because I let you throw April a birthday party even though she's never met you."
"LORELAI: But you were there the whole time. We both threw the party."
"LUKE: I told her that, but I left you alone with them all night and didn't clear it with her first. She's really mad about that. It's not your fault. I should have seen this coming. I was stupid. I didn't think it through."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry."
"LUKE: Yeah, me too. I brought some beer, but I left it in the truck. Be right back."
"HOSPITAL"
"[Logan's room]"
"RORY: Hey."
"LOGAN: So, my dad just left."
"RORY: I saw."
"LOGAN: I still can't believe it. He actually visited. He was only moderately hostile, slightly condescending, and no more self-centered than usual."
"RORY: Well it's good that he came. Good for him. Are you feeling any better?"
"LOGAN: I am. Ofcourse It could have something to do with the 27 medications they have me jacked up on."
"RORY: I checked with the doctor. It's mostly cough syrup and baby aspirin."
"LOGAN: What's wrong? I'm feeling better. [Rory shakes her head] What?"
"RORY: I'm sorry."
"LOGAN: About what?"
"RORY: About letting you go on this trip. I should have stopped you. I was just so busy being mad at you. I didn't think I was trying to punish you, but I was trying to punish you."
"LOGAN: No, Rory."
"RORY: I should have stopped you."
"LOGAN: Hey, you couldn't have stopped me. A team of psychiatrists with tranquilizer g*n couldn't have stopped me. I was going no matter what. It's my fault. Do not feel guilty about this."
"RORY: I just sent you out that door. I didn't even care. I was so cold. I just, I could have lost you."
"LOGAN: You didn't lose me."
"RORY: But I could have, though."
"LOGAN: Look I'm the one screwing things up with us here, not you. I'm sorry you're in the hospital right now. I'm sorry about all of this. I don't what's going on with me, but I'll get better, okay? Things will calm down. I just need you to bear with me, okay? Okay?"
"RORY: Okay."
"ANNA'S STORE"
"[Lorelai enters]"
"ANNA: Oh."
"LORELAI: You okay there?"
"ANNA: Sorry. Spreadsheets, the bane of my existence. Combines my hatred of math with my fear of little, tiny boxes."
"LORELAI: Well little, tiny boxes can be scary. Unless, of course, they contain big diamond earrings."
"ANNA: [Laughs] I hear you. Feel free to look around."
"LORELAI: Thanks."
"ANNA: Have you been in here before?"
"LORELAI: No, first time. It's lovely, great stuff."
"ANNA: Thank you. All the hanging clothes over there are 20% off, some of my favorite stuff, but come march 1st, I can't sell a sweater to save my life."
"LORELAI: Okay, I'll check it out."
"ANNA: You looking for anything in particular?"
"LORELAI: Uh, yeah, you, actually. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. I'm Luke's fiancée."
"ANNA: Oh."
"LORELAI: I wanted to apologize for the party. It was my fault."
"ANNA: It just wasn't exactly what I was expecting."
"LORELAI: I know, and I'm to blame for that, not Luke. It wasn't his idea. He was having a little trouble getting the party going, and I may have thrown myself into it a little too much. I just thought that we should meet so you could see you really have nothing to worry about."
"ANNA: She's a 13-year-old girl. I always have something to worry about."
"LORELAI: Well, yeah, of course, but I meant in regards to me."
"ANNA: Look, I'm sure you're a great person."
"LORELAI: I am. I have references."
"ANNA: But I'm a single mom here. I can't play fast and loose with the people in my kid's life."
"LORELAI: I completely understand. I'm a single mom myself."
"ANNA: Okay then you get it. What if April decided she likes you? What if she becomes attached to you? What if you become her best friend in the entire world, and then one day, you just disappear?"
"LORELAI: Well, that's not gonna happen."
"ANNA: You don't know that. You can't guarantee that, and I can't take that chance. When it comes to my daughter, I have to have rules, hard and fast rules."
"LORELAI: I would never dream of violating any of those rules. Believe me."
"ANNA: April never meets any man I date unless I've dated him for years."
"LORELAI: I totally get that."
"ANNA: So basically, until I'm ready to get married again, she doesn't meet any of the men I date."
"LORELAI: Right."
"ANNA: For all she knows, I'm a nun."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I went through a sister Wendy phase myself once."
"ANNA: I want her to have stability."
"LORELAI: Right. But Luke and I, we are engaged. We are stable."
"ANNA: Engaged isn't married. People get engaged all the time."
"LORELAI: Look, this is not something casual, Luke and me. This is not something we're rushing into, by any means. This has been a long time coming, a long time. This is real."
"ANNA: That's wonderful, I'm really happy for you, but that doesn't change anything. Luke just came into April's life. I'm still nervous about that. He's not a kid guy, never has been, and she's getting very attached. I need to know he's sticking around first. And then, when you're married, we'll deal with that then. I'm not trying to be a hardass here. April's my world. I don't know if my way is the right way. I just have to go with my gut. This is how I want to do it…You said you're a single mom."
"LORELAI: I have a daughter, just like you."
"ANNA: You get where I'm coming from at all?"
"LORELAI: I really do. Anyway, thank you for hearing me out."
"ANNA: Sure. It's no problem."
"LORELAI: Okay. [Lorelai turns to leave]"
"ANNA: Hey. If it makes you feel better, she had a really great time at that party."
"LORELAI: I'm glad. [Lorelai waves goodbye]"

"GILMORE MANSION"
"[Friday Night Dinner, Rory and Lorelai are in a heated discussion, Emily is watching, a little worried]"
"LORELAI: How can you possibly say she looked better with the dark hair?"
"RORY: She did the blonde just seemed like she was trying to be her sister."
"LORELAI: The dark hair makes it look like she's trying not to look like her, plus she does not have the nose for dark hair."
"RORY: What does that mean?"
"LORELAI: Dark hair is like a giant light-up arrow pointing to what is wrong with you. Blond hair, it all sort of blends in in a haze of beige."
"RORY: Nuts, you're nuts."
"LORELAI: You're double nuts!"
"EMILY: All right, that's it. No more spaghetti and meatballs. Musepa, come get these plates."
"LORELAI: Mom!"
"EMILY: Every time we have spaghetti and meatballs, you fight."
"LORELAI: No, no, we're not fighting. We're just, uh, bonding."
"RORY: [Trying to eat] Mmm! Grandma, I'm starving!"
"EMILY: Take these away, Mr. Gilmore's also."
"LORELAI: Mom, come on."
"RORY: I won't fight anymore."
"EMILY: No. Spaghetti and meatballs is just too much excitement."
"RICHARD: [Entering the room] I'm sorry about that. I left work early today, and apparently, that caused everyone's I.Q.S to drop 60 points. My food is gone."
"EMILY: The girls were fighting."
"RICHARD: I told you not to serve spaghetti and meatballs. They always fight when we have spaghetti and meatballs."
"LORELAI: That's not true."
"RORY: We fight just as much when we have Chinese food."
"EMILY: Can we please talk about something besides food?"
"LORELAI: Starvation, scurvy, the Donner party."
"EMILY: I'm having Lasik surgery on my eyes."
"RICHARD: Excellent topic."
"LORELAI: Lasik surgery? Why?"
"EMILY: Well I hate wearing glasses, so I found the best doctor on the east coast, made an appointment, and I'm going in tomorrow."
"RICHARD: Personally, I like you with glasses."
"LORELAI: It's that whole ""dirty librarian"" thing, right, dad?"
"RICHARD: I beg your pardon."
"EMILY: Three of the girls in my D.A.R. Group had it done already. I'm actually very excited about it. I got Dr. Morris..."
"RICHARD: The Lasik man."
"EMILY: ...From Dr. Sugarman, who's my ear, nose, and throat man. And he said Dr. Morris is brilliant and very, very handsome."
"RICHARD: You never told me this."
"EMILY: He just threw it in at the end of the visit."
"RICHARD: I think that's incredibly unprofessional."
"EMILY: Oh, Richard, he just was saying the man is handsome."
"RICHARD: Yes, as if it's a selling point."
"LORELAI: It can be."
"RICHARD: Hardly. Everyone knows ugly men make the best doctors."
"EMILY: That's absurd."
"RICHARD: It's a fact."
"EMILY: Marcus Welby was handsome and George Clooney."
"LORELAI: Fake doctors, mom."
"EMILY: I'm sure they were modeled after real doctors."
"RICHARD: I don't want to talk about this anymore."
"LORELAI: He's jealous of Dr. Handsome."
"RICHARD: I'm not jealous of Dr. Handsome."
"EMILY: I should go shopping for something new to wear."
"RICHARD: You are not going shopping to get something new to wear to Dr. Handsome."
"LORELAI: Everyone is a little testy tonight."
"RORY: Maybe she was right about the spaghetti and meatballs."
"EMILY: Well, let's just talk about something else. We had lunch with Christopher yesterday."
"LORELAI: You…"
"RORY: [Thinking of food] Lunch."
"RICHARD: We took him to the club."
"LORELAI: [Panicked] Okay, but why?"
"RICHARD: Because there'd been a lot of tension between us about the tuition incident, and your mother and I thought it was time for a sit-down."
"LORELAI: A sit down what, did you get Clemenza to hide a g*n in the bathroom first?"
"RICHARD: We thought it was time to clear the air. After all, Christopher is Rory's father, and we wanted him to know there were no hard feelings."
"LORELAI: Really?"
"EMILY: Don't get me wrong. We're still not happy about the situation, but since he's going to be involved in our lives now…"
"LORELAI: Whoa, whoa. Involved in your lives? How is he involved in your lives?"
"EMILY: Well, he's paying for Rory's college."
"LORELAI: [defensive] Yeah but is he using your pen to write the check?"
"RICHARD: Of course not."
"LORELAI: Then I don't see how he's involved in your lives. [Gesturing to Rory] He's involved in her life…"
"EMILY: Lorelai, will you relax? The lunch went fine. It was very pleasant, and Christopher enjoyed it."
"RICHARD: That's right. He apologized for everything."
"EMILY: He knows that we're no longer angry with him, and we are all friends again."
"LORELAI: Well, with friends like these..."
"RICHARD: And after lunch, your mother and I began discussing what we were going to do with all the money that had been allotted for Rory's tuition."
"EMILY: And we came up with a brilliant idea."
"RORY: Oh, yeah? What?"
"RICHARD: We're going to add some funds from our foundation and donate the total amount to Yale university in your name."
"RORY: What?"
"EMILY: That's right, and we'll make sure it goes for something important, like a medical building."
"LORELAI: For really handsome doctors."
"EMILY: Whatever it is, I want her name big and prominent."
"RORY: My name?"
"RICHARD: The Rory Gilmore political science building."
"EMILY: The Rory Gilmore anthropology building."
"RORY: Uh, guys?"
"RICHARD: The Rory Gilmore cultural center."
"EMILY: The Rory Gilmore auditorium."
"RORY: Um can I interject for just a second?"
"LORELAI: Go ahead. I dare you."
"While I think it's very generous of both of you to want to do this for me..."
"EMILY: The Rory Gilmore observatory."
"RORY: ...I still go to Yale, so having something with my name on it might be kind of…"
"RICHARD: The Rory Gilmore center for international affairs."
"EMILY: Oh, wait, the Rory Gilmore library."
"RICHARD: And art gallery."
"EMILY: And ancient-history museum."
"LORELAI: Forget it, kid, grandma and grandpa have gone bye-bye."
"RICHARD: The Rory Gilmore medical research laboratory."
"EMILY: No that sounds like monkey tests, people will picket."

"[Rory is pushing Logan in a wheelchair.]"
"RORY: So, any one of the physical therapists on the list will do? Right doctor they're all at the same level?"
"DR SCHULTZ: They're all top-notch."
"LOGAN: That's if I need a physical therapist."
"RORY: [To Logan] Hush you [To doctor] And you said lots of rest, but is complete bed rest safest?"
"LOGAN: You cannot confine me to a bed. That's a violation of my rights."
"RORY: Hush you."
"DR SCHULTZ: You need to monitor his progress. Everyone recovers at different speeds."
"RORY: And when you say, ""plenty of fluids,"" does hot tea count, or just water? He likes hot tea."
"LOGAN: You gotta stop talking about me as if I'm not here."
"RORY: Logan..."
"LOGAN: Mom..."
"DR SCHULTZ: Tea's fine. Water and juice are better."
"LOGAN: And this wheelchair's absolutely necessary?"
"RORY: Hospital policy sir."
"DR SCHULTZ: Just till you get out of the building."
"LOGAN: Can we at least go faster?"
"RORY: No, you'll get g-forces."
"LOGAN: Doctor, can I go home to your house? I think I'd have much more fun there."
"DR SCHULTZ: Your in good hand, just call if you have any more questions."
"RORY: I will. Thank you, Dr. Schultz."
"RORY: Okay, so, I cut off an old lady with a handicap sticker, so we got a primo spot right out front. Colin is meeting us at the apartment to help me get you upstairs and in bed, and it's a little cold outside, so you might need a scarf. I should have brought you a scarf. Maybe they have some in the gift shop. I'll go check."
"LOGAN: Actually, there's something going on here."
"RORY: What, your throat? Is it sore? Should I go get Dr. Schultz? I mean, we're here. We might as well…"
"[They Rory leans in to see the problem and they kiss]"
"LOGAN: Thank you for being who I want to get out of the hospital for."
"RORY: You're welcome."
"LOGAN: And I'm not cold. I'm fine."

"LOGAN: I promise."

"[Michel is on the phone]"
"MICHEL: This is a lawsuit! You do not fool with people' heads and bodies like this! No! You listen! You…"
"LORELAI: Sookie, emergency, I'm crashing."
"SOOKIE: Fresh pot over there."
"MICHEL: You know you wouldn't treat Nicole Kidman like this. Nicole Kidman, red hair, tall. Okay, then, Julia Roberts, you wouldn't treat Julia Roberts like this. Red hair, tall. Okay, then, Scarlett Johansson. What are you, a shut-in?"
"LORELAI: Why is he prancing?"
"SOOKIE: Hum?"
"MICHEL: I will call my lawyer, and you'll hear from him when I do. Kiss my tush! Mmm! Damn it! You can trust nothing and no one ever!"
"LORELAI: Please stop that, Michel."
"MICHEL: Oh, I cannot. I cannot stop this for a very, very long time. I buy milk from the organic dairy down the way. The nonfat milk has a blue top, blue. Today I find out that they have accidentally been putting red tops on the nonfat milk and blue on the 2%, 2%! For the last two weeks, I have been drinking 2% milk in my coffee every single day."
"LORELAI: Insert gasp here."
"MICHEL: That's two full weeks of two cups of coffee a day. It used to be one cup, but then, suddenly, the coffee started tasting so good, I added an afternoon jolt, and now I find out I've been consuming an extra billion calories a week."
"LORELAI: At least it hasn't affected your ability to do math. [To Sookie] Isn't this bouncing bothering you?"
"SOOKIE: It was, but now it's kind of like having a Beyoncé video on."
"MICHEL: Now I have to burn off all these calories and I have to deal with 2%-fat-milk withdrawal…"
"LORELAI: Michel, why didn't you just look on the bottle?"
"MICHEL: Oh, oh, oh, oh, you just know everything, don't you, you little miss I-know-everything?"
"LORELAI: [Cell phone rings] Hello?"
"LUKE: [in his apartment, putting stuff in the fridge] Hey, gotcha."
"LORELAI: [Sounding nervous] Yes, you did."
"LUKE: We've been missing each other lately."
"LORELAI: Oh, well, things are crazy. You know, we're totally booked up here, and Um Rory has her finals."
"LUKE: You're helping Rory with her finals?"
"LORELAI: Moral support, late-night phone calls -- that kind of thing. And, of course, Michel got the wrong milk today, so..."
"LUKE: oh, well, I didn't know about Michel's milk."
"LORELAI: Okay, so, uh, you heading by the diner today?"
"LORELAI: No, can't. There's just too much to do here."
"LUKE: Okay, well, then, we'll hook up tonight."
"LORELAI: Ah, tonight's a staff meeting, and attendance is mandatory. It would look pretty weird if the person who called the meeting didn't show."
"SOOKIE: [worried] There's a staff meeting tonight? [To Michel] Did you know about a staff meeting?"
"MICHEL: No, I didn't."
"SOOKIE: I don't have a sitter tonight."
"MICHEL: I set up a three-hour session with my trainer tonight. I'll have to pay full price if I cancel this late. It's like $2 zillion."
"LUKE: Staff meeting, I didn't know you had a staff meeting tonight. Did it just come up?"
"LORELAI: Pretty much."
"LUKE: Well, I'm sorry I'm not gonna see you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, me too."
"LUKE: So, tomorrow?"
"LORELAI: Sure, maybe. We'll talk in the morning."
"LUKE: Okay. We'll talk in the morning."
"LORELAI: Okay. Well...bye."
"SOOKIE: I have to get a babysitter if there's gonna be a staff meeting tonight, and Becky, the good one, is at her grandmother's, so I'll have to use her crazy Goth sister who wears the snake around her neck and eats all my Eggos."
"LORELAI: There's no staff meeting tonight."
"MICHEL: [Groans] Thank god!"
"SOOKIE: If there's no staff meeting tonight, why did you tell Luke there was?"
"LORELAI: I don't want to get into it."
"SOOKIE: But if…"
"JACKSON: Sookie! Just the person I was hoping to see... alone."
"SOOKIE: Oh. So, we'll be right back. [The make there way through the Inn] Jackson, wait. What is it?"
"JACKSON: We need complete privacy for this."
"SOOKIE: For what?"
"JACKSON: Smell me."
"SOOKIE: What?"
"JACKSON: Smell me. What do I smell like?"
"SOOKIE: [Sighs] You smell like Jackson and something else. What is that? It's not zucchini. It's not sprouts."
"JACKSON: It's marijuana."
"SOOKIE: [Gasps, happy] Yes! [Shocked] Oh, my god! Jackson, why do you smell like marijuana?"
"JACKSON: You know that back half-acre that I haven't planted for a few years, up on the slope, out of sight, out of mind? Well, I went back there this morning, and it's a giant field of pot!"
"SOOKIE: [Gasps]"
"JACKSON: Every square inch, hundreds of plantings. It looks like Harrison Ford's backyard."
"SOOKIE: How did this happen?"
"JACKSON: The Templeton brothers."
"SOOKIE: The Templeton brothers."
"JACKSON: They must have planted it right before I fired 'em. I told them to weed the back half-acre. They're not the smartest of fellows."
"SOOKIE: They were always listening to the Allman Brothers. We should never hire guys that listen to the Allman Brothers."
"JACKSON: What are we gonna do? It's a full half-acre of marijuana!"
"SOOKIE: Jackson, Shh! We can't keep saying the ""m"" word. Someone will overhear."
"JACKSON: Right, sorry."
"SOOKIE: We need a code word."
"JACKSON: How about ""evil crop""?"
"SOOKIE: Something more normal. Hey, how 'bout ""pickles""?"
"JACKSON: Good. We'll say, ""pickles."" Do you realize that at this moment we are both felons?"
"SOOKIE: Why? We didn't grow the stuff. [Louder] The pickles! We didn't grow the pickles! Ha!"
"JACKSON: But we're in possession. If the cops came to my field today, we'd go to jail. We'd lose everything we own. We'd lose the kids."
"SOOKIE: All because of pickles."
"JACKSON: I'm gonna send my guys home right now. I'm gonna single-handedly pull every last pickle out of there."
"SOOKIE: Good. Yes, good and do it quick."
"JACKSON: I'll try."
"SOOKIE: You're sweating."
"JACKSON: I'm sorry. I can't help it."
"SOOKIE: It makes you look guilty."
"JACKSON: I'll try to stop."
"SOOKIE: We've got to walk out of this room cool and calm, just like it's any other day."
"JACKSON: Cool and calm. Got it. The bump into one another then a table, knocking stuff off] Sorry. [Jackson runs out]"
"SOOKIE: I'll get you coffee."

"LUKE: What can I get you, Kirk?"
"KIRK: What do you think?"
"LUKE: About what?"
"KIRK: Letting the beard grow."
"LUKE: Nice. What can I get you?"
"KIRK: First couple of days, it was itching like crazy, but now I'm used to it, although I find myself doing this a lot. [Puts his hand on his chin like he's thinking]"
"LUKE: What do you want to eat, Kirk?"
"KIRK: Last weekend, I accidentally wrote all over my face with a sharpie, and lulu thought it looked kind of sexy. That's where I got the idea."
"LUKE: It looks really good, Kirk. Now, can I take your order?"
"KIRK: Hmm."
"LUKE: I'll come back."
"LIZ: [Coming into the diner] Big brother!"
"LUKE: Hey, you're back, huh?"
"LIZ: I'm back."
"LUKE: How was the fair?"
"LIZ: Oh, amazing. My jewelry's bigger than ever. I make it, it sells. I got all this money now, but I got no idea what to do with it, not a clue."
"LUKE: How 'bout putting it in a bank?"
"LIZ: There's a thought."
"LUKE: Hmm-hmm."
"LIZ: Hey, let me tell you my big, exciting news!"
"LUKE: Uh-oh."
"LIZ: It's not an uh-oh. It's good, unless you don't like babies, in which case it's not so good."
"LUKE: You're pregnant?!"
"LIZ: Oh, it was supposed to be a surprise. Who told you?"
"LUKE: You just did."
"LIZ: Wow, I blew my own surprise."
"LUKE: That's great, Liz. It's great, right?"
"LIZ: Amazing. I am over the moon."
"LUKE: Well, sit, sit. You're in a delicate state."
"LIZ: I am gonna take care of myself this time, big brother. I'm gonna do all the healthy things for me I did not do last time I was pregnant, like not binge drink."
"LUKE: Good plan. So, where's T.J.? I mean, he must be thrilled about this."
"LIZ: Ah, he's gone."
"LUKE: Gone? You mean gone out of town?"
"LIZ: He's gone, the big ""gone out of my life."" Do you have Matzo Brie?"
"LUKE: What? Liz, no."
"LIZ: Okay. How 'bout a Denver omelet?"
"LUKE: I mean, ""no, T.J. Can't be gone."" He's your husband."
"LIZ: Since when does that keep guys from leaving?"
"LUKE: He's left you?"
"LIZ: He's left."
"LUKE: How can you be so calm about this? Your so calm about this."
"LIZ: Because I got my new come-what-may philosophy."
"LUKE: Your what?"
"LIZ: My philosophy. It's about accepting what comes your way, whatever it is. If a bus is heading right at you, let it come. If a piece of space junk comes hurtling down at you, let it come."
"LUKE: Or you step out of the way."
"LIZ: You know, that's probably better, and when I said what I said now, it felt wrong."
"LUKE: Did he know you were pregnant?"
"LIZ: I'd just told him."
"LUKE: So he ran out on his wife and child?!"
"LIZ: Luke you're getting mad over nothing."
"LUKE: It's not nothing."
"LIZ: Well, I need you to stay calm, because right now it's all about the baby, and it's all good… Really… Come what may."
"LUKE: All right, fine. Whatever. It's all good."
"LIZ: Now, baby and I would like that omelet."
"LUKE: Coming up."

"[Logan is in bed, Paris is talking]"
"LOGAN: Paris?"
"PARIS: Male reproductive tract."
"LOGAN: What?"
"PARIS: Seven up, Seminiferous Tubules, Epididymis, Vas Deferens, Ejaculatory duct, nothing, Urethra, Penis."
"LOGAN: What are you doing?"
"PARIS: Boning up. Pardon the pun. Got my MCATS coming up, medical school."
"LOGAN: I meant, ""what are you doing here?"""
"PARIS: Looking after you."
"LOGAN: Oh, goody."
"PARIS: It's necessary you seem like the kind of lunkhead that would get up too soon and inadvertently push a broken rib bone into his spleen."
"DOYLE: Well, hey, there, sleepyhead."
"LOGAN: Oh, goody, a matching set."
"DOYLE: You sleep well?"
"LOGAN: He's watching me, too?"
"PARIS: Rory said it would be okay."
"DOYLE: Hey now that your awake you mind if I switch the TV to the speakers? They're just about to reunite with their husbands, and I'd love to get the full surround experience."
"LOGAN: Who?"
"DOYLE: Penguins. You haven't seen the penguin movie?"
"PARIS: The penguin movie rocks."
"DOYLE: They'll move you, my friend. So, is it okay?"
"LOGAN: Hey, Mi Casa Es Su Casa."
"DOYLE: Great."
"PARIS: Whoa, whoa, whoa, where do you think you're going cowboy?"
"LOGAN: Nature calls."
"PARIS: You can't get you, Rory said you need complete bed rest. She trusted me with your well-being. I cannot betray that trust."
"LOGAN: Then what's your suggestion for my current predicament?"
"PARIS: I'll get the bedpan. Where's your bedpan?"
"LOGAN: I don't have a bedpan."
"PARIS: You got Tupperware?"
"LOGAN: Paris..."
"PARIS: Doyle, watch him."
"DOYLE: Pausing."
"LOGAN: [Sighs]"
"[Cut to Rory at the Yale newsroom]"
"RORY: [Cell phone rings] Hey, why aren't you asleep?"
"LOGAN: Because I woke up."
"RORY: You're supposed to be asleep."
"LOGAN: I've been asleep for a week. My body's bored of sleep. It wants to do something."
"RORY: Well good thing your body has no say in the matter."
"BILL: Hey, boss, you're gonna want to see this."
"RORY: [Too Bill] Hold on a second."
"LORELAI: You've got to call off your sentries."
"RORY: They're there for a reason."
"LOGAN: To re-enact their favorite scenes from ""Misery""?"
"PARIS: Your kitchen needs organizing!"
"LOGAN: Yeah, I'll get right on that!"
"DOYLE: You shouldn't talk loudly. You'll strain something."
"LOGAN: I've got Dina and Moshe Abramowicz on top of me."
"RORY: Why is Paris in the kitchen?"
"LOGAN: She's looking for a bedpan substitute."
"RORY: Oh dear."
"BILL: You're really gonna want to see this."
"RORY: Just leave it, Bill."
"BILL: But I want to see the look on your face when you read it, provided you still have a face after your head explodes."
"RORY: In a sec."
"LOGAN: Rory, look, I love your concern for me. I love that you're so invested in my well-being, but even the doctor said that if I feel strong enough to move around, then I should do it. It's good for me."
"RORY: I don't know that that doctor knows what he's talking about."
"LOGAN: You mean the Johns Hopkins graduate knows less than you?"
"PARIS: I'd k*ll to get into Johns Hopkins. Here [showing Logan some ""bedpans""] patient's choice."
"DOYLE: Oh, okay if I unpause?"
"PARIS: Unpause."
"DOYLE: Here come the penguins."
"RORY: Look, maybe the doctor knows a little bit of what he's talking about."
"LOGAN: You think?"
"RORY: So I guess get up, but superslow. It should look like a Monty Python routine, you're moving so slow."
"LOGAN: I'll make John Cleese proud."
"RORY: And let Doyle help you, at least the first time, you could get dizzy."
"LOGAN: I'll let him help me to the bathroom door, but I take it from there Ace."
"RORY: Fine."
"DOYLE: I cannot look at the sh*t of the dead baby penguin."
"PARIS: Me neither. Dead people, yes, not penguins."
"LOGAN: You'll deal with Paris?"
"RORY: Put her on."
"LOGAN: Thank you. Paris?"
"PARIS: Can I look?"
"DOYLE: We're clear."
"LOGAN: Please talk to Rory."
"RORY: [Too Bill] What is so important about the Wall Street Journal?"
"BILL: Oh, you'll see."
"PARIS: Hey"
"RORY: [Too Paris] Stand down."
"PARIS: What."
"RORY: Thank you for sitting with him, but I think he needs a little less hovering right now."
"PARIS: Warren b*at jr. Smooth-talk you?"
"RORY: No. Even the doctor said he should be moving around some. I think I've been a little overprotective."
"PARIS: Your call."
"RORY: Have Doyle lend him a shoulder right now, okay?"
"PARIS: Fine. Doyle, give Logan your shoulder."
"DOYLE: You got it."
"LOGAN: See you soonish?"
"RORY: Just finishing up here."
"DOYLE: Mi shoulder Es Su shoulder. [Helps him to the bathroom] Hey, this is very life-affirming, very penguinesque. With the soundtrack music playing like that -- ohh."
"LOGAN: Hurry your soonish."
"RORY: I will. [Ends the call] What is it?"
"BILL: I highlighted the appropriate section. [Rory reads the paper] Oh, it's going to be a quiet, slow-burning seethe. Disappointment."
"DRAGONFLY INN - ENTRY"
"MICHEL: Right this way, you two. Having beautiful weather today, no? [He start to exercise, with out the guest knowing, stopping when they look at him] Let's leave your bags here with the ever-trustworthy William and take a little tour of the inn. Okay, right this way. We have one of the finest restaurants in the area."
"LORELAI: [Cell phone rings] Hello?"
"EMILY: How soon can you get here?"
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: How soon can you get here?"
"LORELAI: Mom, where are you?"
"EMILY: Home, of course. Where else would I be after what happened?"
"LORELAI: What happened?"
"EMILY: ""What happened?""!"
"LORELAI: Yes, what happened?"
"EMILY: The thing with my eye. What else would I be talking about?"
"LORELAI: You're talking about the laser?"
"EMILY: The bad Lasik."
"LORELAI: The Lasik went bad?"
"EMILY: Your father called you. Tell me he called you."
"LORELAI: [Cell phone beeps] Hold on a sec, mom."
"EMILY: Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Hello?"
"[Cut to Richard in a hotel room]"
"RICHARD: Lorelai, it's your father. I'm unconscionably late with this call. Blame South Dakota."
"LORELAI: Dad, what is going on here?"
"RICHARD: Your mother's eye surgery went badly. She's all right, but she can't see a thing."
"LORELAI: Well, that doesn't sound all right to me."
"RICHARD: It's only temporary. She's on k*ll. I would have been there myself, but I was called out of town. Have you ever been to South Dakota? It's the most boring state in the nation. As I was flying in, I swear I saw one of the heads on Mount Rushmore yawn."
"LORELAI: She's asking how soon I can be there."
"RICHARD: Well, that's why I'm calling. I left her with a battery of help, but in case it didn't work out, she wanted me to give you a heads-up that she might need you."
"LORELAI: Well, I don't know if I can get away."
"RICHARD: It's her eyes. She can't do anything or go anywhere."
"LORELAI: I understand the importance of eyes, dad."
"RICHARD: I got caught up in meetings, or I would have called sooner. You wouldn't believe where I'm sitting right now, one of South Dakota's finest hotels. Smells like a foot."
"LORELAI: Let me get back to her, dad. She's on the other line."
"RICHARD: If you could cover for me, I'd appreciate it. If she found out I didn't call you, it would make everything worse."
"LORELAI: Okay you got it."
"RICHARD: Check in with me later."
"LORELAI: Yeah [Switched lines] Mom?"
"EMILY: Was that your father? Did he not call you?"
"LORELAI: No, dad called. I was just distracted before. So, you need me to pop over?"
"EMILY: I'm all alone here, and I desperately need to run a couple of errands."
"LORELAI: And there's no one else?"
"EMILY: I don't remember being in labor for 14 hours with anyone else, so, no, there's no one else."
"LORELAI: Okay. I'll be over."
"EMILY: I'll be waiting, blind and waiting."
"LORELAI: Okay, bye. [Sighs]"
"SOOKIE AND JACKSON'S HOUSE"
"SOOKIE: I don't believe it, I don't believe it!"
"JACKSON: Who knew that clearing it would be the easy part? I had it all down in three hours, no problem."
"SOOKIE: I don't believe it!"
"JACKSON: What was I to do? If I put in the garbage, the garbage man could see it."
"SOOKIE: I know. He looks like a big, fat fink."
"JACKSON: And if I put it down the garbage disposal, it could clog. We'd have to call a plumber, and then he could fink on us."
"SOOKIE: And he would, too. That guy seems like a big, fat fatty fink."
"JACKSON: We can't flush it for the same reason, and burning it seemed like a tremendously dumb idea."
"SOOKIE: You'd get the whole town high."
"JACKSON: So what was I to do?"
"SOOKIE: Anything but bring it home!"
"JACKSON: Then come up with your own idea."
"SOOKIE: Well I could bake it into brownies."
"JACKSON: Then what would we do with the brownies?"
"SOOKIE: I have no idea."
"JACKSON: I think that makes it a bad plan."
"SOOKIE: Is it a better plan than the plan you couldn't even think of? At least it's a plan."
"JACKSON: Hey, we can't turn on each other here. We're all we've got."
"SOOKIE: You're right. You're right."
"JACKSON: Hey, it's starting to smell up the place."
"SOOKIE: We've just got to get it out of the house."
"JACKSON: Definitely out of the house. We'll get it out of the house. [He sits] But we wait for dark."
"SOOKIE: [She sits] Wait for dark."
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"RORY: I could k*ll him!"
"LOGAN: You'd have to get in a very long line."
"RORY: The man should be drawn and quartered."
"LOGAN: There's no fast pass, either. You just got to wait."
"RORY: Quartering's too good for him. He should be eighthed, sixteenthed."
"LOGAN: I don't know you quarter a guy, he's in four pieces. That's tough to recover from."
"RORY: He should be stretched on a rack, iron maiden, strappadoed."
"LOGAN: Oh, my god. What is strappadoed?"
"RORY: When you suspend him in the air with a rope tied to his hands that are tied behind his back."
"LOGAN: You're scaring me with your knowledge of torture."
"RORY: I did a paper on the attorney general. It comes with the territory."
"LOGAN: Life in modern America?"
"RORY: Why would the wall street journal print this? Why?"
"LOGAN: It was an interview with my father. If he said it, they get to print it."
"RORY: Even if it's a flat-out lie?"
"LOGAN: They don't know that."
"RORY: [Reading the paper] ""I looked for the best and the brightest, even at the intern level."""
"LOGAN: Reading it again, you're just torturing yourself."
"RORY: ""Ben Cochran at Harvard, he helped me out with my Boston paper, as did Frank Williams. And Rory Gilmore, I gave her her first internship at my Stamford paper, and now she's the editor of the Yale Daily News."" Arc!"
"LOGAN: It's classic Mitchum."
"RORY: How dare he? ""I gave her her first internship""?"
"LOGAN: This is one of dad's things, Rory, grabbing credit wherever he can, whether it's earned or not."
"RORY: Everyone in America has read this."
"LOGAN: The Wall Street Journal's readership is high, but it's not quite 300 million."
"RORY: Well, enough people have read it."
"LOGAN: Look the beauty of a daily paper, it's in everybody's recycling bin the next morning. This will be forgotten."
"RORY: It won't."
"LOGAN: It will."
"RORY: I remember everything I read, front page, op-ed, concert reviews, it never leaves. My eyes accidentally flit over an obituary, as I'm hunting for the metro section and I can remember the deceased's first wife's name a full month afterward. I mean, and that's just a flit, not even a perusal. If I perused it, I could give you his grandkids in alphabetical order five years later."
"LOGAN: Ace, ace, you drinking this in?"
"RORY: What?"
"LOGAN: Helen Keller just signed water, Annie."
"RORY: You walked!"
"LOGAN: All by my lonesome. You proud of your boy?"
"RORY: I'm very proud. Oh, and your color's coming back. You've gone from white to off-white."
"LOGAN: Hey, can we get to the bottom line on this article here?"
"RORY: Give it to me."
"LOGAN: It's all good. It's very positive what he seed to you. A powerful man is citing you as one of his accomplishments. It is no way a dis."
"RORY: I know."
"LOGAN: It's actually a good thing, so you should let it go."

"LORELAI: Hello? Mom?"
"EMILY: In here."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry. Mrs. Onassis, I was looking for my mother."
"EMILY: Will you at least promise to keep your comedy set at my funeral to under five minutes?"
"LORELAI: Sorry, mom. How are you feeling?"
"EMILY: Horrible. That quack eye surgeon blinded me for life."
"LORELAI: I don't think he blinded you for life."
"EMILY: Well, he blinded me for the next two days, at least. The procedure was a disaster. He did one eye and then announced that the new procedure didn't comport to the anatomy of my eye, so he had to resort to the old procedure, which I absolutely did not want."
"LORELAI: 'Cause it's so last year."
"EMILY: And, of course, he wouldn't go near the other eye until he saw how this one healed."
"LORELAI: Well, that makes sense."
"EMILY: And then Dr. Mengele told me to rest and is having me put eyedrops in every hour, further impeding my vision. And to top it off, the man looked nothing like Marcus Welby."
"LORELAI: Okay, mom, where are all the people?"
"EMILY: What people?"
"LORELAI: Well Dad made it seem like you were surrounded by a small army you know, enough people to care for you, then go topple Saddam's statue."
"EMILY: They're all gone."
"LORELAI: Gone where?"
"EMILY: To hell, I hope, one person more incompetent than the rest."
"LORELAI: But all of them? The nurse?"
"EMILY: They'll do a ""60 minutes"" on that woman one day. Mark my words!"
"LORELAI: Uh, housekeepers?"
"EMILY: Ate everything that wasn't nailed down."
"LORELAI: The errand boys?"
"EMILY: Their pants hung down below their underwear, and no one was worse than the driver he got me. Have you ever met the cab drivers in Prague?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no."
"EMILY: Well, they would hide their wallets from this man. Plus I think he had a g*n in his pocket."
"LORELAI: Maybe he was just happy to see you."
"EMILY: Lorelai, up. [Lorelai moves to sit next to Emily] It doesn't matter anyhow. I'm fine getting my own food, and I don't need people underfoot. I called the agency, and a new maid will be here tomorrow morning, but I need to run some errands today, and, obviously, I can't drive. You'll have to do that."
"LORELAI: Do what?"
"EMILY: Drive me."
"LORELAI: Oh mom why don't you just give me the list of errands and I'll do them for you?"
"EMILY: No it would take too much explanation. Grab my bag, please."
"LORELAI: Mom, seriously, um what kind of errands are they? Shopping, banking, hardware store?"
"EMILY: I need to get my coat first."
"LORELAI: Mom, is it dealing in human trafficking? 'Cause I'm an excellent people person."

"LORELAI: Mom, mom, you've got to look up."
"EMILY: I can't look up. The sun causes searing pain."
"LORELAI: Mom, the sun can't even find you under that hat. If we put that hat on frosty the snowman, he'd be living in Miami right now."
"EMILY: You're a very insensitive person, you know that?"
"LORELAI: Yes, I do. Here we go."
"EMILY: What is this?"
"LORELAI: This is my car."
"EMILY: We have to take the other car."
"LORELAI: What other car? [Points to a big SUV] That's not a car. That's a rap-video set."
"EMILY: I ordered it specially. It has the darkest windows available. They say it's the car jay-z uses when he's in town. I assume that's an entertainer of some sort. The windows are bulletproof. They kept saying that as if it's a selling point. I told them I was not paying extra for bulletproof windows. I haven't been strafed in years."
"LORELAI: Mom, I don't understand, what do you mean, we'll take this car? I thought the driver left."
"EMILY: He did."
"LORELAI: Is there another one coming?"
"EMILY: No."
"LORELAI: Well, who's gonna drive?"
"EMILY: You are."
"LORELAI: I can't drive that."
"EMILY: Why not?"
"LORELAI: Because, look at it. I'm sure you need a special license or something."
"EMILY: Lorelai, I cannot ride in your jeep. It's completely exposed to the elements. You do remember I'm recovering from surgery, don't you?"
"LORELAI: No really, I thought you were just doing your best Mia Farrow in ""Broadway Danny Rose"" impersonation."
"EMILY: Lorelai, I need my prescriptions. If I don't get my prescriptions, infection will set in, and I will lose my eyesight completely, and you will be doing this more than just today. Now, what's it going to be? [Lorelai opens the door]"

"T.J.: What?"
"LUKE: Get up!"
"T.J.: Okay."
"LUKE: Now, I am not here to listen to you explain your side or rationalize things or justify your actions. I am here for one reason only, to punch you out."
"T.J.: Hey, cool. You see that? That was like in an old western where everyone cleared the bar. I never seen that in person."
"LUKE: Don't be cute. Just get ready to be hurt."
"T.J.: Damn."
"LUKE: What?"
"T.J.: I just wish I was drinking faster. Cause If I was more drunk, getting punched out wouldn't hurt so much."
"LUKE: Just shut up and let's do this."
"T.J.: Go ahead."
"LUKE: Well, get ready."
"T.J.: I'm ready."
"LUKE: Raise your arms or something."
"T.J.: No."
"LUKE: I'm not gonna punch you like this."

"T.J.: I'm not hitting you, Luke. I got nothing against you. Plus there's no fighting inside. It's Lanny's top rule, along with no burning down the place. That actually comes first."
"LUKE: Well, then, let's take it outside."
"T.J.: Luke let me ask you one question, really quick and then you can take me outside and clobber me."
"LUKE: Okay, what?"
"T.J.: What the hell is this about?"
"LUKE: You're unbelievable! It's about Liz!"
"T.J.: What about her? Is she all right?"
"LUKE: All right? You walked out on her!"
"T.J.: No, I didn't."
"LUKE: Yeah, you did. That's why you're here drinking in the afternoon."
"T.J.: That's not why I'm here drinking. I'm drinking because I'm upset."
"LUKE: You're upset?! You abandoned Liz and your baby!"
"T.J.: Hey, I would never do that. I love your sister, Luke. She threw me out."
"LUKE: That's not what she said."
"T.J.: We came home from the fair. It was great. We were both happy. We made money. Then Liz goes to the doctor, and she comes home and tells me she's pregnant. I hug her. I kiss her. I'm crying, I'm so happy. Then I turn to grab the phone to tell the family, and an ashtray hits me in the back of the head, then a phone book and a stapler and our statue of a happy clown playing the saxophone."
"LUKE: I'm not getting this."
"T.J.: She's yelling at me saying things like, ""this ain't gonna work. You're gonna mess this kid up. You can't raise a kid."" She's saying, ""this kid will grow up with no discipline. ""It'll get out of control. Then we'll end up having to send it away."" I tell her she's wrong. I'll do whatever's needed. I'll read every book on the subject, even though I hate reading worse than I hate public television. But Liz won't hear it. She tells me to go."
"LUKE: She told you to go?"
"T.J.: So I packed a bag and left. I didn't want to, but Liz is always right about everything, and if my staying around is gonna screw up the kid like that, I'm gone, no questions asked."
"LUKE: Oh, jeez, Liz. [Sighs]"
"T.J.: What?"
"LUKE: Have a seat, T.J. Give me a beer. Listen, T.J... Liz wasn't talking to you when she was saying all that stuff. She was talking to herself."
"T.J.: I'm pretty sure she was talking to me. She kept saying my name."
"LUKE: No, when she said you were gonna mess up the baby, she was saying something else. Just take out the ""you."" Make it an ""I."""
"T.J.: She meant you're gonna screw up the baby?"
"LUKE: No, she meant she was."
"T.J.: And I was."
"LUKE: No, just her."
"T.J.: Then why didn't she throw the ashtray at herself?"
"LUKE: Because she was taking it out on you."
"T.J.: Oh. This is complicated."
"LUKE: That's because people are. Sometimes they just don't say what they mean."
"T.J.: Yeah I hate that it's hard enough following them when they're talking about what they're talking about."
"LUKE: That's the trick with relationships, believe me. Look, you have to try to tune in what your partner means as opposed to what she's actually saying. They sometimes won't tell you how they're feeling, but your job is to try to figure out what she's saying from what she actually says."
"T.J.: Wow."
"LUKE: Yeah."
"T.J.: I got none of that."
"LUKE: It's okay. It's all gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay."

"[Lorelai is driving the SUV, a car honks it's horn as it passes them.]"
"LORELAI: Ah, sorry."
"EMILY: Lorelai, be careful."
"LORELAI: I'm not used to driving a m*ssile silo down the street."
"EMILY: Oh, stop being so dramatic."
"LORELAI: Yeah, wouldn't want to be dramatic."
"EMILY: All right, get over here. You're going to turn right."
"LORELAI: [car horn honks] Aaah! Sorry!"
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: Well, it's a big freakin' car, mom."
"EMILY: You're gonna give me a heart attack."
"LORELAI: Mom, please, how long is this gonna go on? You won't tell me where we're going. You give me block-by-block instructions."
"EMILY: My goodness Lorelai you've been complaining since we got started."
"LORELAI: No, I haven't."
"EMILY: When we had to go to three different drugstores?"
"LORELAI: Well, come on."
"EMILY: I don't trust generic."
"LORELAI: Mom, it's the same thing."
"EMILY: If I'm willing to pay full price, then I deserve to have my drug bottle say ""valium"" on it."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"EMILY: I don't see why that's insane."
"LORELAI: Fine."
"EMILY: So, have you talked to Christopher lately?"
"LORELAI: Uh, no, not lately lately."
"EMILY: I have."
"LORELAI: Well, bully for you."
"EMILY: You know, your father and I enjoyed our little sit-down with him very much."
"LORELAI: Oh, I'm glad."
"EMILY: You know, I'd forgotten what a handsome man Christopher is. He was wearing a very nice blue tie. And his hair is very short. Normally, I don't like a man's hair that short. It makes him look like a convict or a masseuse, but I think it works on him."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I'm sure it does."
"EMILY: He seemed lonely, though."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: He's not dating anyone. I asked."
"LORELAI: Well, he's got G.G."
"EMILY: Who's G.G.?"
"LORELAI: His daughter, mom."
"EMILY: Oh well, we didn't discuss that. But I could tell he was lonely."
"LORELAI: I'm sure he's fine."
"EMILY: You know, I've been racking my brain, trying to think of a nice girl to set him up with. Cezanne Moriarty just got divorced, and she looks wonderful. She'd go perfectly with his hair and tie. Cezanne Moriarty is 10 years older than Christopher."
"EMILY: Lorelai, you were in the same class together."
"LORELAI: I know. It's 'cause she was stupid. We used to call her ""moroniarty."""
"EMILY: Well, Loretta singer's husband just died. She'll be back from Bali soon."
"LORELAI: She's got a horse face."
"EMILY: Not anymore."
"LORELAI: She's not his type, mom."
"EMILY: What about Brandi Covington? She's a lovely girl with a wonderful sense of humor."
"LORELAI: ""A wonderful sense of humor""?"
"EMILY: Yes."
"LORELAI: What joke has Brandi Covington ever told?"
"EMILY: Well, I don't know."
"LORELAI: She has a wonderful sense of humor. Tell me one of her jokes."
"EMILY: I don't know any."
"LORELAI: An amusing anecdote she's told?"
"EMILY: I don't know, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: A giggle-inducing pun."
"EMILY: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Dirty limericks, song parody."
"EMILY: Well, she has a lovely laugh."
"LORELAI: Oh, so she does not have a wonderful sense of humor, she can appreciate a wonderful sense of humor."
"EMILY: I guess that's right."
"LORELAI: Fine, tell me a joke she's laughed at."
"EMILY: You're being impossible."
"LORELAI: Mother, Christopher can get his own girls. Now, he's busy with G.G., But when the time is right, he'll date. Just sit back and let me drive."
"EMILY: Rory thinks he's lonely, too."
"LORELAI: [A car honk it's horn, Lorelai honks back.] I'm in a t*nk, pal! Come and get me!"
"YALE DAILY NEWSROOM"
"RORY: Sheila's out today, so warn Mark that there's going to be an unexpected, enormous pile of annoyance on his desk and just to deal with it."
"KIMBERLY: [Speaker phone] Hello?"
"RORY: [Rory picks up the hand set] Yes, hello. Is this Kimberly wells?"
"KIMBERLY: Yes, it is."
"RORY: Thank you for taking my call, Ms. Wells."
"KIMBERLY: Call me ""Kimberly."""
"RORY: Okay, Kimberly, the reason I'm calling is..."
"KIMBERLY: Something to do with my interview with Huntzberger right?"
"RORY: Yes, it has to do with that."
"BILL: Give 'em hell, Harry."
"KIMBERLY: So, what's this about?"
"RORY: I'm calling to request a correction."
"KIMBERLY: Oh, to what?"
"RORY: To everything that Mitchum said about me."
"KIMBERLY: I'm looking at the piece now. He didn't say much about you."
"RORY: Hmm. Well, that's the thing, he didn't use many words, but he said a lot."
"KIMBERLY: ""And Rory Gilmore, ""I gave her her first internship at my Stamford paper, and now she's editor of the Yale Daily News."" What part of that is wrong?"
"RORY: None of it, technically, but essentially, it's all a lie."
"KIMBERLY: Did he give you an internship at the Stamford eagle-gazette?"
"RORY: Yes, he did, but…"
"KIMBERLY: And are you not editor of the Yale Daily News?"
"RORY: Well, I am, actually, but it's the impression he left that he gave me my start. He did not give me my start."
"BILL: Tell her if a correction's not appropriate, maybe a clarification is."
"RORY: That's dumb."
"BILL: Doesn't hurt to ask."
"KIMBERLY: Hello?"
"RORY: Sorry. I got distracted. Um, here's the thing, Mitchum is depicting me as one of the feathers in his cap. I am not one of his feathers."
"KIMBERLY: Yes, but here's our thing, we can't print corrections to impressions. That would be chaos."
"RORY: Even if the impression is wildly misleading?"
"KIMBERLY: Again, that's an impression. We don't correct impressions."
"RORY: I see. What about a clarification?"
"BILL: Good girl."
"KIMBERLY: We don't do those either."
"RORY: I see."
"KIMBERLY: I really need to run."
"RORY: You know it's just gonna bug me forever that he put this out there."
"KIMBERLY: That's showbiz."
"RORY: Okay, you're right. I mean, I guess it's gonna be in people's recycling bins by tonight and totally forgotten by tomorrow, right?"
"KIMBERLY: Actually, I always hope that the stuff I work so hard on isn't just totally forgotten the next day."
"RORY: Oh, yeah, well, me too. I mean, back at you, sister. Um, thank you for your time."
"BILL: Wait, wait."
"RORY: Could you hold on a second, please? [To Bill] What?"
"BILL: Ask her if there are any internships available, it could fax her my…"
"RORY: Ugh! Thank you for your time."
"LUKE'S DINER"
"[Liz is at a table with 4 other women]"
"WOMAN: I tell him to clear the plates, and he's like, ""I'm tired. I've been on my feet all day."" And I'm like, ""I don't care if you've been on your feet all day ""at that crappy job that doesn't pay enough that we can even go to Dollywood once in a while."""
"LIZ: Yeah, that's not good, not going to dollywood. It's rude."
"WOMAN: He could have taken one of his city tests, and maybe he could have been a cop or something, not that he could fire a g*n straight. I kick his ass at the sh**ting range every time."
"LIZ: Yeah, the yin of it, the yang of it totally..."
"LUKE: Liz?"
"LIZ: Oh, hey, big brother. Excuse me, girls."
"LUKE: Um, who are they?"
"LIZ: They're the support group of single moms I hooked up with. They're horrible! All they do is bitch, bitch, bitch. I'd have left every one of them, too."
"LUKE: So, Liz... look at me. Now, listen."
"LIZ: I'm listening."
"LUKE: You are gonna be a great mother to this kid."
"LIZ: What?"
"LUKE: You heard me. You're in the best shape you've ever been. You've got money. Jess turned out fine. Your son turned out fine. He's doing great."
"LIZ: Yeah, but…"
"LUKE: Put your fears aside. I know you can do this."
"LIZ: I'm scared."
"LUKE: But you've got help. You've got a good man. He loves you. He's gonna be a great dad, if you let him."
"LIZ: If he'll forgive me. [Luke points outside, Liz looks] T.J."
"LUKE: He was too afraid to come inside."
"LIZ: He's not wearing a jacket."
"LUKE: I told him to bring a jacket."
"LIZ: He's always forgetting his jacket."
"LUKE: All right, he needs you, you need him, now go to him. Make up, go home, okay? Go home with T.J."
"LIZ: Thanks, Luke."
"WOMAN: Where are you going, Liz?"
"LIZ: My man's here."
"WOMAN: Oh, yeah. Looks like a real winner."
"LUKE: So, can I get you ladies anything, compassion, perspective?"
"[Luke looks out to see Liz and T.J. kissing and making up]"
"SUV PULLING UP"
"LORELAI: [Sighs] Okay, mom, what's next?"
"EMILY: You don't have to say it like that."
"LORELAI: I just spent the last hour and a half watching you get a manicure."
"EMILY: It's my standing appointment, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Yes, except I was the one standing 'cause there weren't enough seats."
"EMILY: Well if I'd missed that appointment, it would be week before I could get another and I'd be walking around with hobo hands. Now, stop being so surly. This is the last stop."
"EMILY: Great. You realize we're in Beacon Falls?"
"EMILY: So what?"
"LORELAI: So we've driven almost as far as Stars Hollow. Now I'll have to drive you all the way back to Hartford."
"EMILY: Well, I'm sorry, Lorelai. Next time I have some sort of illness, you can put me on an iceberg and float me out to sea. Lets go."
"LORELAI: This is a real-estate office. What errand do you have to run at a real-estate office?"
"EMILY: Are you coming?"
"LORELAI: Am I coming with you to the real-estate office?"
"EMILY: Don't forget to lock the door. I'm leaving my bananas here."
"LORELAI: Mom, why are we going to a real-estate office? Mom! Ugh!"
"[Cut to inside the real-estate office ]"
"EMILY: Excuse me. I'm…"
"LORENE: Emily?"
"EMILY: Lorene, hi. I'm sorry if we're late. I had this awful surgery yesterday, and today has been a nightmare."
"LORENE: Oh, I hope you're feeling all right."
"LORELAI: Oh, she's fine. Dragging that cross around made her a little tired."
"EMILY: Lorene, this is my daughter, Lorelai. She has headaches, and that tends to make her babble."
"LORENE: Oh, I'm sorry. Can I get you some aspirin?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, thanks. I'm okay. I've had the headache for 38 years."
"EMILY: We are anxious to see those pictures."
"LORELAI: What pictures?"
"LORENE: All right. Well, follow me. I have the whole presentation ready for you."
"LORELAI: What presentation?"
"EMILY: Lorene, how are your twins?"
"LORENE: They are going to be seniors next fall."
"EMILY: They grow up so fast, don't they?"
"LORELAI: Like weeds. What presentation are we looking at?"
"LORENE: Here we are."
"LORELAI: Mom."
"LORENE: So, I talked to the owner, and he said that they would be willing to throw in any of the furniture or appliances that we might like, completely up to you."
"EMILY: Well, that's wonderful."
"LORELAI: Why is that wonderful, why is throwing in furniture and appliances wonderful, mom?"
"EMILY: Go on, Lorene."
"LORENE: Anyhow, the pictures are pretty complete, but I can get us in this weekend if you would like to take a closer look yourself."
"LORELAI: Do you, mom? Do you want to take a closer look?"
"LORENE: This is only the second time that this house has been on the market in 100 years. It's got 5 bedrooms, 4 1/2 baths with a library, a sun porch. It's on 3 acres with a very small what they call a fishing hole, which is really a little pond, but it's very charming, and it has stables for horses."
"EMILY: I thought so."
"LORENE: The roof is in good shape, but I think that the plumbing will need some updating. But the sellers are motivated, and I think it's a pretty special property."
"EMILY: I do, too. [To Lorelai] Don't you? Lorelai? Are you breathing?"
"LORELAI: Why are you looking at this house, mom?"
"EMILY: [To Lorene] Would you give us a minute?"
"LORENE: Of course. I'll be right over here if you need me."
"EMILY: Well, what do you think?"
"LORELAI: Mom, please, tell me what is going on."
"EMILY: I will tell you what's going on as soon as you tell me honestly what you think of this house."
"LORELAI: I think it's fine."
"EMILY: ""Fine""?!"
"LORELAI: Mom, it doesn't look like your type of house at all."
"EMILY: I did not ask if you thought it was my type of house. I asked what you thought of the house."
"LORELAI: Well, I think it's a beautiful house."
"EMILY: So do I."
"LORELAI: You already have a beautiful house, mom."
"EMILY: Oh I know, this house is not for me. It's for you."
"LORELAI: [surprised] Me?"
"EMILY: You and Luke. Now, before you get your nose out of joint and accuse me of interfering, hear me out. I think your house is very nice. I know you've put a lot of work into it. But, Lorelai, it's too small for the two of you, especially when you have children, if you have children, I mean. A man needs his own space and room, and Luke does not have that at your house. Also, I know you've always wanted horses, so I thought something with a little property might be nice. Now, I know it's not actually in Stars Hollow, but it's right on the border. It's only an extra 10 minutes to the inn and an extra 5 minutes to the diner. Plus I did a little nosing around, and I heard that if you grease the palm of the stars hollow zoning commissioner, a man named Taylor Doose, you can get him to change property lines, so we can give you a stars hollow address if it's really important to you."
"LORELAI: You want to buy us a house? [she get up to look at the pictures]"
"EMILY: Well, I know you're not going to let me give you a wedding, so I thought a house would do."
"LORELAI: All that running around Stars Hollow, you and dad were looking for a house for me?"
"EMILY: Well of course, you didn't think we wanted to live there, did you? Small-town charm is good for a weekend, Lorelai, but I have no interest in having a next-door neighbor walk in with a pie, wanting to chat. I would k*ll myself and my neighbors. [Lorelai starting to look sad] Now, I'm sure Luke will need some convincing. He doesn't look like the kind of man who willingly takes extravagant gifts from people, so I've concocted a few good lies we can tell him. It's for his own good, and once the two of you in the house…"
"LORELAI: it's not gonna happen. [Starting to cry]"
"EMILY: What? Well, of course it will. If we have to pay more than the asking price, your father and I are totally prepared…"
"LORELAI: Luke and I, the wedding, it's not gonna happen."
"EMILY: What?"
"LORELAI: [Sniffles]"

"SOOKIE: I'm toting heavy bags here."
"JACKSON: Don't say that out loud."
"SOOKIE: I didn't say what was in the bag."

"SOOKIE: Does Neil toke? We could give all of this to the town troubadour to give to him."

"LUKE‘S DINER"
"[Taylor enters]"
"TAYLOR: Is everyone seeing what's going on out here? Lucas, have you eyeballed the chicanery that's taking place outside?"
"LUKE: What? Eyed what?"
"TAYLOR: Balled, eyeballed these hooligans!"
"LUKE: How interested do I look in talking to you, Taylor?"
"TAYLOR: Not very."
"LUKE: And this is the very peak of my interest."
"TAYLOR: My god, there's another one!"
"KIRK: I have a theory, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Let's hear it."
"KIRK: Our usual town troubadour, he was discovered last week on these very streets."
"TAYLOR: Discovered?"
"KIRK: Some big-time music manager was limo-ing through town, and he caught one of the troubadour's songs, gave him an opening slot on Neil Young's tour."
"TAYLOR: Who's Neil Young?"
"KIRK: One of the Monkees. Anyway I'm guessing when word hit the east coast troubadour community, every one of them thought to come to stars hollow for their sh*t at the big time."
"TAYLOR: There's an east coast troubadour community?"
"KIRK: Oh, yes, our wandering musical storytellers. It's an honored American tradition going back to the puritans. Gierke Schoonhoven delighted his fellow pilgrims with his timely songs. His most popular was ""a beaver ate my thumb."" It was quite catchy. I wonder if Neil still does ""Last Train to Clarksville."" I love that song."
"TAYLOR: [Exhales sharply]"
"[Cut to out side Luke's, Mary Lynn Rajskub is singing]"
"TROUBADOUR3: [singing] I drive an '89 volvo"
"have you seen it anywhere?"
"'Cause I can't seem to find it"
"and no one seems to care"
"I don't know how it happened"
"I've never lost a car"
"I might have to retrace"
"my steps back to the bar"
"I stepped into a puddle"
"I'm bleeding from the lip"
"my shirt mysteriously opens…"
"TAYLOR: Excuse me, uh, bohemian people! May I have your attention, please?"
"TROUBADOUR3: I'm kind of doing a song here."
"TAYLOR: It won't take long. Please, people, your attention! I would just like to say that there is no bigger fan of music than the man standing before you. No memory is more precious to me than the one of my father taking me to the Hartford civic auditorium to see the great Pat Boone. But you, my friends, do not have the talent of Pat Boone. And if you insist on loitering and playing your hippie doo-wop music to the obvious detriment of the mercantile interests of this town, our authorities will forcibly remove you… with water hoses and canine units if necessary! Thank you for your time, and, uh... goodbye."
"TROUBADOUR3: [She Picks up her stuff and moves on] Can you say ""BTK""?"
"LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR"
"[Lorelai drives up in the Jeep]"
"LORELAI: [Looking at her cell phone] Oh, sh**t. [she dials]"
"RORY: You're grounded. Ha. Sorry, mom. Kimmy saw this guy at the mall who was a total Chachi, and he bought us a slurpee, and we totally lost track of time."
"RORY: I called you twice. I left messages. I called the national guard, who didn't answer because they're all in Baghdad."
"LORELAI: Well I just checked my messages."
"RORY: I won't be ignored, Dan."
"LORELAI: I know. I'm hiding my rabbit as we speak."
"RORY: So what's the deal?"
"LORELAI: No deal. I, um, spent the night at Sookie's last night."
"RORY: Why?"
"LORELAI: No reason, we were talking and it got late, so I crashed on her couch and woke up covered in jam."
"RORY: Is everything all right?"
"LORELAI: Everything's fine. How's it going with you?"
"RORY: Well, Logan graduated."
"LORELAI: Ah that's right, the graduation. Wow. How was it?"
"RORY: I'm here now. It was nice. Logan looked great, very dignified. He didn't trip. He remembered to wear pants."
"LORELAI: He's quite a catch, that guy."
"RORY: I was very proud of him. I'm just waiting for him to extricate himself from those people."
"LORELAI: Oh his parents are there, hu?"
"RORY: Yep, they are with Logan, and I am standing a good 50 feet away."
"LORELAI: As per the restraining order."
"RORY: They're dragging him out for drinks, 30 minutes tops we're meeting back at the apartment, and then he'll be all mine. I've got the afternoon planned out."
"LORELAI: Ah you're such a girlfriend. You should take him to the mall."
"RORY: I'll think about it."
"LORELAI: So, you take pictures?"
"RORY: Only about a thousand. I'll bring my camera tonight. Oh, listen, just a heads-up, I might have to duck out after drinks."
"LORELAI: No! Why?"
"RORY: I made reservations at this crappy Italian restaurant with Chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling, and the husband and wife that own the place wind up screaming at each other after 8:00, we love it."
"LORELAI: Sounds great."
"RORY: Well it's our last night together for a while. I want it to be really special."
"LORELAI: Sounds perfect."
"RORY: I better get back. I'll see you tonight?"
"LORELAI: Okay, hon. See you tonight."
"LORELAI'S HOUSE"
"[Lorelai comes in the front door]"
"LORELAI: Hello! Babette! [Paul Anka comes up] Hi, buddy. Where's Babette?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, she had to go, honey. I told her I'd take the morning shift. She told me to tell you that everything went fine. Paul Anka ate all his food, and then he did something weird with your nightgown."
"LORELAI: Oh, are you cross-dressing again? I got here at 7:30. I gave him a little kibble and a new hoof, and he ran around the house a few times and then passed out in the corner. He's been quiet ever since."
"LORELAI: Thank you guys for doing this, Patty. Paul Anka's never spent the whole night alone before."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, it's our pleasure, sweetheart. So, you're staying out all night, huh? Anything illegal?"
"LORELAI: Oh, no, no. Just a little girls' night out. Or in, I should say. Sookie and I had a slumber party."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, that sounds fun."
"LORELAI: Do you want some coffee, Patty?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, no, sweetheart. I need to get going. I'm teaching a cardio striptease class at 10:00. I have to make sure those poles are screwed in tight."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"[Front door opens]"
"LUKE: Lorelai, you here?"
"LORELAI: Tell him I'm not here."
"MISS PATTY: What?"
"LORELAI: Patty, please. Tell him I'm not here. [Hides on Rory's room]"
"MISS PATTY: No, no, but I… Luke, hi."
"LUKE: What the hell are you doing here?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that."
"LUKE: [sounding worried] I'm looking for Lorelai."
"MISS PATTY: Well, she's not here."
"LUKE: Her Jeep's right out front."
"MISS PATTY: Well all I know is she called to have me come and feed Paul Anka."
"LUKE: Called from where?"
"MISS PATTY: I don't know. The inn, maybe."
"LUKE: No, she's not at the Inn I tried the Inn."
"MISS PATTY: Well, uh, I-I don't know. You know, half the time people speak to me, I'm thinking about Baryshnikov. Did you see ""turning point""?"
"LUKE: No."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, that man was so beautiful."
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm sure."
"MISS PATTY: Pure sex walking. Flying, actually. That man could fly. Have you ever thought of taking dance?"
"LUKE: Me? No."
"MISS PATTY: Well, maybe you might want to think about it. There's nothing sexier than a man in tights."
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm sure that's true. Look, can you just tell Lorelai I came by?"
"MISS PATTY: Oh, of course I will, honey."
"LUKE: Stop imagining me in tights, patty."
"MISS PATTY: It's a free country, honey. [Luke leaves] He is so easy."
"LORELAI: Thank you, patty."
"MISS PATTY: Something going on with you and Luke?"
"LORELAI: It's nothing. We had a little fight, nothing big. I'm just..."
"MISS PATTY: Punishing him. Good for you. The longer the freeze-out, the better the makeup."
"LORELAI: Yes, exactly. Listen thank you for doing this."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, sure, any time. If you need anything else, just give me a call."
"LORELAI: I will."
"MISS PATTY: Oh, and, honey, don't freeze him out too long. Luke is a much better man than my first husband... or second husband. But he's neck and neck with the third one, though."
"LORELAI: Okay."
"MISS PATTY: Bye, Paul Anka! Thank you for letting me scratch your butt for an hour! Just like husband number four."
"LORELAI: [Chuckles] Bye."
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"[Rory is waiting, she hears the elevator dings]"
"MITCHUM: Pete Michaels will be there for at least the first two months. You meet him in Omaha."
"LOGAN: I know."
"MITCHUM: He runs the department, so he's the one to see. He's a good guy. [cell phone rings] I got to go."
"LOGAN: Yeah, I'll talk to you later."
"MITCHUM: [On the phone] Yeah?"
"[Logan makes his way into the apartment]"
"LOGAN: Hey."
"RORY: What happened?"
"LOGAN: It took longer than I thought."
"RORY: Way longer and I've got to leave for my grandparents' like right now."
"LOGAN: To top it off, just as the family thing is winding down, a bunch of dad's business automatons came by and he made me stay to talk shop."
"RORY: To talk shop."
"LOGAN: Synergy and new media ventures in increasing shareholder value. I could hear my soul dying."
"RORY: He's doing this on purpose."
"LOGAN: I wouldn't put it past him."
"RORY: Why is he doing this?"
"LOGAN: Look don't think about him. Just go, go to your thing. Get it over with. I'll wait for you here, go."
"RORY: Okay."
"LOGAN: No more thoughts about Mitchum."
"RORY: Your right, no more thoughts."
"LOGAN: Go."
"[Cut to Rory entering the hall way outside the apartment,]"
"MITCHUM: Yeah. At this number. Here, call me back. Bye. [Rory runs to the elevator, stops the doors and enters.] Oh. Hello, Rory… Were you at the ceremony? We didn't see you."
"RORY: Yeah, I was there."
"MITCHUM: Ah."
"MITCHUM: We didn't see you."
"RORY: Well, I was there… Did you know that Logan and I had plans to go out after the ceremony? I mean were you aware of that?"
"MITCHUM: No, I was not."
"RORY: Yeah. 'Cause why would your son want to go out with his girlfriend the last day before he leaves, right?"
"MITCHUM: Rory…"
"RORY: And this gathering of yours, it turns into a business meeting on his graduation day? As if Logan's not gonna have enough time for that during the year you're forcing him to do in London."
"MITCHUM: It wasn't exactly a business meeting."
"RORY: Why are you doing this?"
"MITCHUM: Doing what?"
"RORY: Why are you taking him away from me. Why? Do you hate me that much?"
"MITCHUM: I don't hate you."
"RORY: Yeah, right."
"MITCHUM: Why would I hate you?"
"RORY: Because I'm dating your son."
"MITCHUM: Logan's love life is his business. I don't get involved."
"RORY: Oh, please. You have done nothing but get involved."
"MITCHUM: How?"
"RORY: You're sending him away, 5,000 miles away. What other reason is there but to separate us?"
"MITCHUM: Well you flatter yourself if you think I put that much energy into thinking about your relationship."
"RORY: Here's the lobby."
"MITCHUM: Wait let's get this clear right now. I'm sending Logan away for one reason, because it is time, it is time for him to stop jumping out of planes in a gorilla mask and crashing boats and getting plastered every night and ending up in the hospital. It's time for him to stop being a child and to start being a man. It's time for him to start focusing on his future, and the only way he is gonna do that is to get him out of his environment and away from those dopes, Colin and Finn, and ""The Life and Death Brigade"" and get him on a path. Logan is talented he's talented. He's my son. I want him to achieve something. And he needs a push. It's what my father did with me. He pushed me, I grew up, and now Logan is gonna grow up. Anything here you're not agreeing with? [Rory is quite] I didn't think so."
"STARS HOLLOW – NEAR THE MUSIC SHOP"

"we tore the playhouse down"
"we ran headlong in our way"
"yeah, we tried so hard"
"we stared at the sun too long…"
"CLIFF: got your mail here, Taylor."
"TAYLOR: Thanks, cliff. I guess the last group of miscreants didn't get word that troubadours are ""persona non grata"" in STARS HOLLOW. Just one more rat I have to exterminate. See ya, cliff. [Taylor look out to the town square to see dozens of troubadours playing.]"
"GILMORE MANSION"
"EMILY: Gerta, you're half my age. Why do I always b*at you to the door?"
"LORELAI: Hi, mom."
"EMILY: Hello, Lorelai. So, just you tonight?"
"LORELAI: Well, I know how mad you get when I bring the insane clown posse with me."
"EMILY: So no Luke?"
"LORELAI: Luke's working."
"EMILY: All right. So, how are we?"
"LORELAI: We're good. We're Fine. We're starving. We'd love a drink."
"EMILY: Your father's making martinis in the living room. [To the maid] Oh, now your legs work. Here, hang these up. And eat something with sugar!"
"RORY: [OS] That's it. [Emily make there way to the living room] I'll take care of the rest. Just say whatever it takes and get him out of there about 9:30. I trust you, Finn… No, it's not a surprise you've never heard anyone say that before. Just get Colin and get him out of there. Bye. [Hangs up the phone] Sorry, everyone. I'm off it for good now."
"RICHARD: Hello, Lorelai."
"LORELAI: Thanks, dad. Hello. What's this?"
"RICHARD: Don't touch that!"
"RORY: He slapped my hand earlier."
"EMILY: It is top secret."
"LORELAI: Oh, my god. It's the w*apon of mass destruction. Quick, get the president on the phone."
"RICHARD: Lorelai."
"LORELAI: If he's not in the oval office, try the ice-cream room."
"EMILY: Just tell them what it is, Richard."
"RICHARD: Well, it looks like we're going to receive a tidy little settlement from the charlatan that botched your mother's eye surgery."
"EMILY: A very tidy settlement."
"RICHARD: And we've decided to add it to the money we're donating to Yale."
"LORELAI: Thank god. Finally a hot meal for the lacrosse team."
"EMILY: We're adding it to the money we're donating in Rory's name."
"RORY: Oh, goody. They didn't forget."
"EMILY: And with that extra money, we can now afford what is on the table right in front of you. Richard, do the honors."
"RICHARD: All right. Miss Rory Gilmore, may I present... your building."
"RORY: What?!"
"EMILY: Your science building."
"[Lorelai starts laughing]"
"RICHARD: On the Q.T., A friend of mine who knows the architect snagged the model for me. It's a beaut, isn't it? Built perfectly to scale."
"EMILY: Very sleek. And there's plenty of wall space inside for a portrait."
"RORY: Of who?"
"EMILY: Of you."
"RICHARD: And look right here. My friend attached a placard to the front of the building."
"LORELAI: [Reading the placard] The Rory Gilmore Astronomy Building."
"RORY: Um, grandpa…"
"EMILY: They're going to start construction this summer, so it should be up and running by Christmas."
"RORY: Is this the actual lettering? I mean, is this the scale?"
"RICHARD: I don't know. Although the style is very dignified."
"EMILY: I'm sure we can request this lettering if you like."
"RICHARD: It's your building, so why not?"
"RORY: Because the lettering would be 30 feet high."
"LORELAI: Well honey it's the astronomy building. You have to be able to see it from space."
"RICHARD: I don't know whether it's to scale."
"RORY: Well is there someone we can call to check?"
"EMILY: Relax, Rory. She's so modest."
"LORELAI: Relax, Rory. Remember when you wanted a personalized license plate? So much better."
"EMILY: We're going to try to get them to add another floor so that it's taller than everything around it."
"RICHARD: Make it stand out a bit more."
"RORY: More than this?!"
"LORELAI: I love the portrait idea."
"RORY: Who's not helping?"
"LORELAI: Hmm?"
"GERTA: Excuse me, everyone. Christopher Hayden has arrived."
"[The girls look surprised]"
"EMILY: Christopher, how wonderful. Come in. Come in."
"LORELAI: W-what are you doing here?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I was invited. [Leans down to kiss Lorelai on the cheek, then Rory]"
"LORELAI: [Sounding like she's 16] Shut up! Me too!"
"EMILY: We promised Christopher a home cooked meal last time we saw him, and since we're leaving for Europe, for the next 2 months, [kisses Emily] this was the last chance we had to make good on that promise."
"RICHARD: You can call a Gilmore many things, but you can't call him a welsher."
"LORELAI: What are the things you can call him, just for future reference?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm very grateful for the invitation, Emily."
"RICHARD: Martini, Christopher?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Sounds good. What's this?"
"LORELAI: Oh it's Rory's building."
"RORY: It's not my building."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's got your name on it. Wow are those letters to scale?"
"RORY: Oh, boy."
"CHRISTOPHER: 'Cause it's gonna be huge."
"RORY: Yeah. Okay dad, you can take my seat because I have to go legally change my name and transfer to brown."
"LORELAI: Honey, now come on. We have teased you way worse than this before. Remember when you were 10 and thought you discovered U2?"
"RORY: I should get going. Logan's leaving in the morning."
"EMILY: Oh, that's right. Tell him to have a safe trip."
"RORY: I will."
"EMILY: [Doorbell rings] My goodness. It's grand central station here tonight. Come on, Rory. I'll walk you out."
"LORELAI: Bye, honey."
"RORY: Bye."
"RICHARD: Christopher. [hands him a drink]"
"CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. So, he's leaving, huh?"
"LORELAI: Yeah he's going to London to work for his dad."
"RICHARD: She should be very proud of that boy."
"LORELAI: She should buy him an observatory."
"EMILY: [Coming back in to the room] Well, look who I found outside."
"RICHARD: Oh. Carolyn."
"CAROLYN: Hello, Richard. How wonderful to see you, especially standing so close to a martini."
"RICHARD: [Chuckling] Oh, Carolyn, that sense of humor of yours. One martini coming right up."
"EMILY: Carolyn, this is my daughter, Lorelai. Lorelai, this is Carolyn Bates…""Lynnie"" to those in the know."
"LORELAI: Oh, am I in the know?"
"CAROLYN: You are now. Nice to meet you."
"LORELAI: You too."
"EMILY: And, Lynnie, this is Christopher Hayden."
"CHRISTOPHER: Nice to meet you."
"RORY: Lynnie, olives or a twist?"
"CAROLYN: Olives, please."
"EMILY: Lynnie's mother and I go so far back, I'm embarrassed to talk about it. Lorelai, you remember my talking about Marie Randle. We were roommates in college."
"LORELAI: ar-hu"
"EMILY: Well, Lynnie is her daughter, and she just moved to Hartford, so, of course, we promised her a dinner. And since we're going to be out of town for the next couple of months, tonight seemed like the perfect opportunity."
"LORELAI: Tonight she's settling up all old debts, huh?"
"RICHARD: Lynnie, I've got your two olives."
"CAROLYN: Thank you very much, Richard."
"EMILY: [Too Lorelai] Move."
"LORELAI: What?"
"EMILY: Move [grabbing Lorelai's arm]"
"LORELAI: Ow! The arm is supposed to be connected to the body!"
"EMILY: Lynnie, sit down next to Christopher. Lorelai's gonna sit with me."
"CAROLYN: Okay."
"EMILY: You know Lynnie is a psychologist. Isn't that fascinating?"
"CAROLYN: I do a lot of work with family counseling, runaways and drug recovery."
"LORELAI: Arm-yanking rehab. [Emily pinches her] Ow!"
"EMILY: Lynnie just moved here from Maine. Isn't that interesting? I've never been to Maine. Christopher: Have you ever been to Maine?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, no, but I like lobster."
"CAROLYN: Well, then, you're in."
"[Laughter]"
"EMILY: I tell you, Lynnie, you're a card, just like your mother. Christopher you should meet her mother. [Lorelai and Chris share a look] She's a stitch. Isn't Lynnie's mother a stitch, Richard?"
"RICHARD: She's an entire seam, Emily."
"EMILY: It's so important to find someone who can make you laugh. I was always so envious of Johnny Carson's wives. I just thought these women must do nothing but laugh all the time. How's your drink, Lynnie?"
"CAROLYN: Very potent. Thank you, Emily."
"EMILY: Well, potent is good because tonight is a party. Which reminds me, Christopher Lynnie once threw her mother the most wonderful birthday party. I think she made the cake herself, didn't you, Lynnie? [She nods] Oh, these days a woman who can bake is a rare treasure, isn't she? And Lynnie is a Leo."

"OFFICER RUSKIN: Well, I'm here now, Taylor. What do you need?"
"TAYLOR: Handcuff these ruffians and take them away."
"OFFICER RUSKIN: In what?"
"TAYLOR: In your car."
"OFFICER RUSKIN: Well, I came on my bike."
"TAYLOR: Why?"
"OFFICER RUSKIN: Fred took the car. Plus my handcuffs are broken."
"TAYLOR: Well, then, find an appropriate vehicle to haul them away."
"OFFICER RUSKIN: My sister has an S.U.V. But she's out of town, though."
"TAYLOR: Well, then, line them up and have them follow you to jail."
"OFFICER RUSKIN: I could do that, but it's a single cell, though. It holds two, maybe three if they're not fat. And we don't have any food."
"TAYLOR: Oh, forget it...Barney Fife."

"TAYLOR: How did I let this happen? This is your fault. You had to go off and make it in the big time, and now they're all copying you."
"TROUBADOUR: The big time? I made 700 bucks and got booed. And I never even met Neil Young. Heart of gold, my ass."
"TAYLOR: I suddenly feel very tired."
"MISS PATTY: Would you like a tiramisu?"

"CHRISTOPHER: That's good advice, doc, thanks."
"LORELAI: Excuse me. I'm just gonna go to the restroom."
"EMILY: Well, hurry back. Dinner's almost on."
"LORELAI: Yes, ma'am."
"CAROLYN: My sister just had twins last week."
"CHRISTOPHER: Twins? Wow, that sounds…"
"CAROLYN: loud?"
"CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckling] Exactly."
"EMILY: I'm sorry, I know I'm being very forward, but the picture of the two of you sitting there so young, so beautiful, it's almost like looking at a shampoo ad."

"[Cut to the restroom, Lorelai entering]"
"LORELAI: Oh, my god. What are you doing?"
"CHRISTOPHER: [Closes the door] What do you mean what am I doing? I thought ""restroom"" was code for ""follow me, and we'll talk about how to get you out of this."""
"LORELAI: What the hell kind of spy school did you go to?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, I'm here now, so let's figure out how to get me out of this."
"LORELAI: Out of what?"
"CHRISTOPHER: What do you mean, ""out of what""? This is a setup."
"LORELAI: So it seems."
"CHRISTOPHER: I can't believe Emily would do this."
"LORELAI: You're talking about Emily Dickinson, right? 'Cause Emily Gilmore was made to do this."
"CHRISTOPHER: I thought I was having dinner with you and Rory. I didn't realize I was going on a date."
"LORELAI: Well luckily you didn't get ugly overnight."
"CHRISTOPHER: Thanks a lot, by the way."
"LORELAI: What did I do?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Nothing! You're just sitting there, not saying anything."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about? When mom said, ""doesn't he look like Cary Grant?"" I said, ""yes."""
"CHRISTOPHER: You're just letting this happen."
"LORELAI: I'm not just letting this happen."
"CHRISTOPHER: You can't see that I'm miserable out there?"
"LORELAI: No, I can't. You seem fine. You're talking to her."
"CHRISTOPHER: She's talking to me what am I supposed to do, slap her in the mouth?"
"LORELAI: That would be a conversation stopper."
"CHRISTOPHER: I assumed at some point you'd jump in and try and save me."
"LORELAI: By doing what?"
"CHRISTOPHER: I don't know, deflect, detract, get the conversation off her and me and us."
"LORELAI: I'm sorry. I didn't know you needed saving."
"CHRISTOPHER: [Laughing] Oh, come on."
"LORELAI: ""Oh, come on""? How do I know you don't want to date her? You're single. She's single. You're pretty. She's pretty. It's how all great divorces start."
"CHRISTOPHER: How did I used to get out of here?"
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"CHRISTOPHER: In high school, I'd be in your room. I had several ways of sneaking out of here."
"LORELAI: Chris!"
"CHRISTOPHER: Which drainpipe was it that I used to crawl down?"
"LORELAI: Christopher!"
"CHRISTOPHER: I think I used to get to it from the attic window, does the attic window still access the drainpipe that drops you off by the garage?"
"LORELAI: You do know you're grown up now. You can just walk out the front door."
"CHRISTOPHER: If I just leave, I'll insult your parents."
"LORELAI: But vanishing into thin air, way more polite."
"CHRISTOPHER: It's only 8:00! This night's gonna last forever. We haven't even had dinner yet."
"LORELAI: [Laughs] Relax. Now that I know you're not interested in her…"
"CHRISTOPHER: I'm not!"
"LORELAI: Okay. Now that I know, I can help you out."
"CHRISTOPHER: You will?"
"LORELAI: Yeah, I got your back."
"CHRISTOPHER: Okay, thank you."
"LORELAI: You're welcome. I know you always got mine."
"CHRISTOPHER: Always."

"LORELAI: Yeah."

"EMILY: It's paella. I got the recipe from Hilde Macintosh , whose son married a Spanish girl. God knows how long it's going to last, but the food at their wedding was wonderful. Do you like it, Lynnie?"
"CAROLYN: I do."
"EMILY: Not too spicy?"
"CAROLYN: I like spicy food."
"EMILY: Do you? Well, Christopher, did you hear that? Lynnie likes spicy food, and so do you. Isn't that something?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Uh, yes. Small world."
"LORELAI: Hey, Lynnie, I have a recurring dream where a walrus waddles up, lies down on me, falls asleep, and I can't breathe. What do you think it means?"
"RICHARD: Lorelai..."
"LORELAI: What dad Lynnie is a psychologist. She should know."
"CAROLYN: It's okay. Umm It could mean a myriad of things, too much stress at work, something in your life is strangling you, you've read ""Alice in Wonderland"" too many times."
"EMILY: Touché, Lynnie."
"RICHARD: She's got wit and wisdom, this one."
"EMILY: You know, Christopher does the Sunday New York times puzzle every single week."
"LORELAI: Hey, what's it called when you're afraid of spiders?"
"CAROLYN: Arachnophobia."
"EMILY: You have arachnophobia?"
"LORELAI: No."
"RICHARD: Thank goodness."
"LORELAI: What's it called when you're afraid of people who are afraid of spiders? ‘Cause that one I've got."
"EMILY: Oh, lord."
"CAROLYN: I don't think there's a technical term for that yet."
"LORELAI: How about arachnophobiaphobia? 'Cause that makes sense."
"EMILY: You know, Christopher, Lynnie…"
"LORELAI: voices in your head, totally normal right?"
"CAROLYN: Excuse me?"
"LORELAI: There's only two... that speak English."
"EMILY: Lorelai, eat your Paella."
"RORY: So, Christopher, how's business going?"
"CHRISTOPHER: It's really been picking up lately."
"CAROLYN: What do you do?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Oh, I'm in computer software."
"CAROLYN: That sounds exciting."
"CHRISTOPHER: Can be, it's a lot of traveling, actually…"
"CAROLYN: I love traveling. It's one thing I miss about my job."
"LORELAI: You know what I think is even better than traveling? Time-traveling. Do you think that's possible?"
"CAROLYN: I would have no idea."
"EMILY: Lorelai, are you having some kind of breakdown?"
"RICHARD: You're very quiet, Christopher."
"CHRISTOPHER: Well, I, uh –"
"LORELAI: Lynnie, as a psychologist, tell me what do you think of ""The Sopranos""?"
"CAROLYN: Actually, I miss Adriana."
"LORELAI: Oh, so do I."
"EMILY: Lorelai!"
"LORELAI: What? I was serious about that one."
"EMILY: That's it. No more talk until dessert."
"ELEVATOR TO LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"[Doors open]"
"COLIN: Come on! One more stop!"
"LOGAN: I can't."
"FINN: But tomorrow you'll fly away to London and we will forget all about you."
"LOGAN: I'm touched, but Rory will be back in a minute."
"COLIN: You know I'm starting to get the feeling you'd rather be with her, than us."
"FINN: Impossible."
"LOGAN: I appreciate the drinks and the diversion. Your friendship is worth a couple pages in my memoir. But as of now, it's goodbye. I'm spending the rest of the night alone with my girl."
"[The apartment door opens]"
"RORY: [British accent] Hello, governor. Chips?"
"LOGAN: I'm sorry. I was looking for my girlfriend."
"RORY: Oh, I'm sorry, mate. No girlfriends here. Just us birds and blokes taking the piss out of each other."
"They make there way in]"
"LOGAN: Your accent is terrible, by the way."
"RORY: Just go with it, you geezer. Now we've heard that you're about to fly away to old blighty, and word 'round the pub has it you're not happy about it."
"LOGAN: Well, I'm leaving a couple people I'm pretty fond of... and some people I'm a little afraid of, but all in all..."
"RORY: Well, we're just going to have to change your mind, because London, you see, is a place of fun and musical excitement, the queen, hello! Magazine."
"LOGAN: You're gonna break into a chorus of ""Imim Chimney"" any minute."
"RORY: Shush, now. None of that talk. Because tomorrow, brilliant things will happen, a new life, a new adventure. You like adventure, don't you, mate? Well, London is certainly the place for that, and we, frankly, would not be the fine chaps we claim to be if we did not send you off in a proper way, [Raises her voice] with the bash of a lifetime! [cheering from the party goers] Come on. Someone get this chap a pint. See if you can't be happy, at least you can be drunk."
"LOGAN: Kiss me, Mary Poppins."
"RORY: [Normal voice] Really I thought it was more Gwyneth Paltrow, ""Shakespeare in love."""
"LOGAN: Kiss me."
"MAN: To the queen!"
"EVERYONE: To the queen! [Cheers]"
"GILMORE MANSION – INTERIOR"
"[Front door]"
"EMILY: Well, that was a complete waste of time."
"LORELAI: What are you talking about?"
"EMILY: I'm talking about Christopher and Carolyn leaving separately."
"LORELAI: Well, come on, mom. What did you think? They were gonna throw down and consummate it right here in the foyer?"
"EMILY: No, I didn't think they were gonna throw down and consummate it in the foyer. I just thought they could go out for coffee."
"LORELAI: You served them coffee."
"EMILY: So what?"
"LORELAI: You can't be shocked when you serve people three cups of coffee, and they don't feel like going out for coffee. Not everyone is me."
"EMILY: I just thought they would have hit it off better, than that."
"LORELAI: Well you never know with these things."
"EMILY: I was just so sure. Oh, well. Maybe next time."
"LORELAI: Absolutely."
"EMILY: Christopher's probably too immature for Lynnie, anyway."
"LORELAI: I'm sure he is."
"EMILY: The way he was going on and on about that motorcycle of his. I half expected him to start talking about his Tonka truck and announcing to the room he wanted to be a fireman or a cowboy someday."
"LORELAI: Sure is nice when it's not me. All right, bye, mom. Have a nice trip."
"EMILY: Goodbye, Lorelai. [Shuts the door] Gerta, did I fire you?"
"GERTA: No."
"EMILY: Really? Everything's off tonight."
"[Cut to exterior, Lorelai making her way to the Jeep.]"
"CAROLYN: You also know that it is one meal, and one meal does not a lifestyle make. That's okay, Sandra. All right. Okay. Call anytime. I'll talk to you on Monday. [Too Lorelai] Sorry. I'm blocking you in."
"LORELAI: No, no, that's okay. So, you do sessions over the phone?"
"CAROLYN: I do sessions whenever people need them."
"LORELAI: Wow. That's quite a commitment."
"CAROLYN: Well, I've always been a good listener. Excellent note-taker. I have fantastic penmanship. Good head-nodding abilities."
"LORELAI: You found your calling."
"CAROLYN: [Chuckles] I think I did."
"LORELAI: So, it was nice meeting you."
"CAROLYN: Oh, you too. You too. This was, this was really very sweet of your mom."
"LORELAI: Well, you keep thinking that."
"CAROLYN: Hey, it's been a long time since I've been invited to such a blatant setup. It made me miss my own mom. [Cell phone rings] Oh, I'll just let it go to voice mail."
"LORELAI: Your work sure follows you around, huh?"
"CAROLYN: When you're going through something, you never know when you're gonna need to talk. Sometimes it sneaks up on you."
"LORELAI: Yeah, I suppose so."
"CAROLYN: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Me? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. It was really nice meeting you. Sorry if I talked too much during dinner. Every now and then, I just feel the need to re-enact certain key scenes from ""Purple Rain,"" you know, for a captive audience. The lake Minnetonka scene really bugs my mom, so..."
"CAROLYN: I could analyze that one for you if you want."
"LORELAI: That one, I've got a handle on. Other things are more fuzzy, but that one, I got."
"CAROLYN: Okay. [awkward pause] Lorelai?"
"LORELAI: Yeah?"
"CAROLYN: Do you... do you want to talk about something?"
"LORELAI: Me? No, no, I'm good. It was nice meeting you. Bye. I got to go."
"[Cut to inside Carolyn's car, Lorelai in sitting in the back, Carolyn in the drivers seat]"
"LORELAI: My parents have been married for 40 years, and that's, like, mind-blowing for me because there is no one worse at communication than my mother, except my father and most of my relatives. It is not a chatty group, basically. Everything in the Gilmore house was ""don't talk about it. Shove it aside."" Of course, I talked about it and shoved it right in your face, but still, I don't know. I never saw myself getting married."
"CAROLYN: Never?"
"LORELAI: Not until max asked me... I think. I mean I guess I thought about marrying Christopher when everyone was freaking out because I was pregnant, but I never thought about it in a longingly, good way."
"CAROLYN: That could be why."
"LORELAI: Why?"
"CAROLYN: Well, marriage was just a solution to a problem, not anything romantic or because you were in love. Plus it came from your parents."
"LORELAI: I love that I've got one more thing to blame my mother for."
"CAROLYN: What about max? Did you love him?"
"LORELAI: No, I didn't. I wanted to, but...I didn't. I don't think I never really loved anyone, until Luke. Did I tell you I proposed?"
"CAROLYN: No. You didn't."
"LORELAI: I did. I saw this guy in front of me who was a real...man. He was solid, and he was strong. He would protect me, but he, he got me. I knew all that when we started dating. But that moment, when I realized how much he cared for Rory, that was it. Suddenly I knew I was ready."
"CAROLYN: Did he accept right away?"
"LORELAI: Pretty much…Hey, where's the weirdest place you ever had a session?"
"CAROLYN: Skull mountain at six flags."
"LORELAI: So, not this."
"CAROLYN: Nope, not this."
"LORELAI: Well, not only have I screwed up your night, but it's not even a good story."
"CAROLYN: It's still a pretty good story."
"LORELAI: Yeah, that's good, 'cause I like to entertain. You know. I should have been a monkey in Washington square park with, like, a snappy hat. I feel so stupid. I really had myself believing it was gonna happen. I bought that stupid dress, and now it's just hanging there, mocking me. And the crazy thing is, I am ready to get married. I am ready to start the next phase of my life. I want another kid, and I, I don't want to wait anymore. I don't want to be patient. I've been patient long enough. I'm not happy, and I feel crappy all the time. And I just think I've had it."
"CAROLYN: So...what are you gonna do? Only you can make you wait. Nobody else can. You need to decide what you want and what you're willing to give up to get it, and then you got to be okay with that, or you got to be okay with waiting."
"LORELAI: I could lose him if I push too hard."
"CAROLYN: You don't really seem to have him now, at least not the way you want to have him. You won't get anything unless you ask for it. And if you ask for it and you don't get it, maybe it wasn't worth having in the first place. Some things are just never meant to be, no matter how much we wish they were."
"LORELAI: I can only imagine what you could do if you had a couch."
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT"
"[Party is still going on]"
"RORY: Want to put money on who nails the queen?"
"LOGAN: I think her highness is pretty safe tonight."
"RORY: Why? I thought Jenny and Paul broke up."
"LOGAN: They got back together this morning."
"RORY: Do the boys know?"
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: Are you gonna tell them?"
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: Well, watching your best friends waste precious scoring moments, you can get kicked out of the club for that."
"LOGAN: Yeah, well... you know, I have given a lot of great parties in my lifetime."
"RORY: Oh, I know."
"LOGAN: But I do believe that this one has topped them all."
"RORY: Hey, it's not over. We have hours to go. There's plenty of beer left, and no one's slugged Finn yet, so..."
"LOGAN: Thank you."
"RORY: My pleasure… You want more beer?"
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: More Twiglets, Cadburys?"
"LOGAN: I'm good."
"RORY: Do you want try the Frug again? ‘Cause I think my cramp has gone away."
"LOGAN: Tell me not to go."
"RORY: What?"
"LOGAN: Tell me not to get on that plane. Tell me to blow off my father, the paper, the whole Huntzberger destiny. Just tell me I can figure something else out. Just tell me not to go."
"RORY: Well, I can't do that."
"LOGAN: Hey, you afraid the teacher's gonna see or something?"
"[Music playing by Petula Clark]"
"PETULA CLARK: Don't stand in the pouring rain, don't sleep in the subway..."
"LUKE'S DINER"
"LUKE: No, I can't just charge you for half a cup of coffee."
"TROUBADOUR: But I'm not gonna drink the whole cup. Seems like a gyp."
"LUKE: Well."
"[Lorelai enters]"
"LORELAI: Hey. I need to talk to you."
"LUKE: Where have you been?"
"LORELAI: It doesn't matter."
"LUKE: What are you talking about it doesn't matter, I've been looking everywhere for you. I tried your cell. I went by the inn. Patty was at your house."
"LORELAI: Let's elope."
"LUKE: [Stunned] What?"
"LORELAI: Come on, Luke. Grab your keys. Let's go."
"LUKE: Elope?"
"LORELAI: You said that would be fine at Martha's Vineyard. Didn't you say that would be fine at Martha's Vineyard?"
"LUKE: Yes, I did. I'm just…"
"LORELAI: Come on, then! Let's go! We can drive to Maryland. What the hell, right? I mean, you have to see Maryland eventually. We can drive there, get married, and then come back here. And you'll get your stuff, and you'll move in."
"LUKE: Okay, hold on."
"LORELAI: I mean we have the plan already, right? We just have to put the plan in motion."
"LUKE: Let's calm down. We don't have to figure all this out now, do we?"
"LORELAI: Yes, we do, because we've been waiting and putting it off, and I don't want to put it off anymore."
"LUKE: But right now?"
"LORELAI: Yes, now is the right time. It's the best time because it's now!"
"LUKE: Come on. [Opens the door]"
"LORELAI: Your car or mine?"
"LUKE: Lorelai, let's just talk this through."
"LORELAI: No I don't wanna talk, all we've done for months is talk. I want to do. I want to go."
"LUKE: We can't just take off and get married."
"LORELAI: Why not, Luke? Don't you love me?"
"LUKE: You know I do."
"LORELAI: But I love you, Luke. I love you. But I have waited, and I have stayed away, and I have let you run this thing, and no more. I asked you to marry me, and you said yes."
"LUKE: Yeah, I'm just trying to think here."
"LORELAI: We fixed up the house, right? We have a bigger closet, and I didn't get the purple wallpaper because you didn't want the purple wallpaper. And if it's between you and the purple wallpaper, I pick you!"
"LUKE: I didn't tell you not to get the purple wallpaper."
"LORELAI: Oh my God you didn't like it."
"LUKE: I don't care about wallpaper!"
"LORELAI: Do you care about me?"
"LUKE: Yes!"
"LORELAI: Because I'm going crazy here. I made a commitment to you, and I need to make it happen."
"LUKE: It will, it will happen, okay? I just have April to consider."
"LORELAI: But once we're married, everything with April will be fine. Anna said so."
"LUKE: Anna said so, what does that mean?"
"LORELAI: When I talked to Anna…"
"LUKE: When did you talk to Anna?"
"LORELAI: After the party…"
"LUKE: I didn't know you talked to Anna, you weren't supposed to talk to Anna."
"LORELAI: I know. I'm sor… God, no! I'm not gonna defend myself! For months now, I've been skulking around not saying anything, not having an opinion, like I'm Clarence Thomas or something, and I… I'm done with that. I-I've been waiting for a long time, and I don't want to wait anymore."
"LUKE: I have to think this through."
"LORELAI: No!"
"LUKE: I have April!"
"LORELAI: You're gonna have to figure out how April fits into our lives, not the other way around."
"LUKE: I'm trying."
"LORELAI: Well, try married!"
"LUKE: Just wait!"
"LORELAI: No! I'm not waiting! It's now or never!"
"LUKE: I don't like ultimatums!"
"LORELAI: I don't like Mondays, but unfortunately they come around eventually."
"LUKE: I can't just jump like this."
"LORELAI: Well, I'm sorry to hear that. [Sniffles] And I have to go."
"[Luke looks stunned as Lorelai walks away]"
"[Sam Phillips playing ""Taking Pictures""]"
"SAM PHILLIPS: [Singing] When I take a picture of the city it disappears"
"it's only a photograph the city is gone"
"places I go are never there"
"the places I go are never the-e-e-e-re"
"and nostalgia isn't what it used to be"
"I can only picture the disappearing world"

"CHRISTOPHER: Hey."
"LORELAI: [Almost crying] Hey."
"CHRISTOPHER: You okay?"
"LORELAI: Uh, I'm having a really bad night, and, um... I just don't want to be alone. Okay?"
"CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Uh, come on in."
"LOGAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING"
"[Rory is asleep]"
"LOGAN: Rory."
"RORY: Logan?"
"LOGAN: Don't get up."
"RORY: You're dressed. Why are you dressed?"
"LOGAN: My bags are already in the car."
"RORY: The car?"
"LOGAN: It's downstairs. I just wanted to tell you…"
"RORY: [Jumps up out of bed] I'll be five minutes. I just have to find the closet."
"LOGAN: Relax."
"RORY: I'll just grab shoes and a coat."
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: No shoes. Just a coat."
"LOGAN: You don't have to come."
"RORY: Your leaving, I have to go with you to the airport."
"LOGAN: No."
"RORY: I have to go to say goodbye."
"LOGAN: Rory, no."
"RORY: Yes. I have to wave to you at the gate."
"LOGAN: They won't let you. They'll stop you at security."
"RORY: Okay, well, I'll wave to you at the metal detectors."
"LOGAN: Rory..."
"RORY: I have to go with you."
"LOGAN: No!"
"RORY: Yes. You are leaving for London. Who knows when we'll see each other again?"
"LOGAN: I thought that was all set."
"RORY: What was all set?"
"LOGAN: Christmas, thanksgiving, Guy Fawkes day."
"RORY: That's so far away. I…"
"LOGAN: Rory, if you come with me, I won't get on the plane…I've paid for the apartment for the next year, so you don't have to worry about that. There's still a few weeks left on the car service, so use it whenever you want. I know that you won't, but just in case you need to. I'll call you when I get in, okay?"
"RORY: [Sniffles]"
"[They kiss]"
"LOGAN: What?"
"RORY: [Sniffles] I keep trying to think of fabulous things to say, but all I can think is, ""say hi to William and Harry for me."" [Sniffles]"
"LOGAN: I love you, ace."
"RORY: [Chuckles] That's so much better than ""say hi to William and Harry for me."""
"[They kiss again]"
"LOGAN: I have to go."
"[Rory is trying nor to cry as Logan gathers his stuff, Rory goes to the door to watch him get in the lift]"

"CHRISTOPHER: [OS] Miriam, where's the pink coat?"
"MIRIAM: [OS] She doesn't have a pink coat."
"CHRISTOPHER: [OS] G.G.! Come back here!"

"G.G. : Is she sick?"
"CHRISTOPHER: No. [Picking up G.G. and handing her to the maid] Miriam..."
"MIRIAM: Sorry, Mr. Hayden."
"G.G. : I don't like to wear my nightgown to bed when I'm sick, either."
"CHRISTOPHER: I'll explain later. Have fun at school. Bye-bye hon."
