LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Rory wakes up, walks past some of the mess from the previous nights party and see a gift on the counter. She opens it and is surprised, she pulls or a 2 foot high rocket and stands it on the counter and wonders what it means]
CHRISTOPHER'S APARTMENT – BEDROOM
[Lorelai and Chris are in bed with Chris' arm resting over Lorelai]
CHRISTOPHER: [Grunts] Hey.
LORELAI: Hey.
CHRISTOPHER: What are you doing?
LORELAI: Um...go back to sleep. [Lorelai get up]
CHRISTOPHER: Come back to bed.
LORELAI: Oh, I can't I got to go.
CHRISTOPHER: Stay.
LORELAI: No um I can't -- Paul Anka.
CHRISTOPHER: No way he's performing this early. Check your tickets.
LORELAI: No, I got to go home and feed him.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, let me make you breakfast first.
LORELAI: No.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on you're no good if you collapse from hunger before you feed him. It's like how, when you're on an airplane, you put on your own oxygen mask before your kids. It seems selfish, but…
LORELAI: [snaps back] No… [Sighs] Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: Lore.
LORELAI: Really. You sleep. I got to get going.
CHRISTOPHER: You sure?
LORELAI: Yeah. Okay. Bye. [Lorelai leaves quickly and looks discussed with here self]
[opening credits]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai enters and walks into the living room]
BABETTE: [almost shouting] You're back!
LORELAI: Ohh! God, Babette, you scared me. [Paul Anka comes in] Hi
BABETTE: It's my voice. It frightens the hell out of people. I don't know what to do about it.
LORELAI: Oh well, you could start by not hiding out in people's houses and leaping at them when they come home.
BABETTE: It's the nodules.
LORELAI: Who?
BABETTE: It's the nodules on my vocal chords. The more I strain my voice, the more they grow. It's nature's way of trying to get me to talk softer.
LORELAI: Babette, one. Nature, nada.
BABETTE: I bet you're wondering why I'm here.
LORELAI: Yeah. Not that I'm not happy to see you. It's just that I have to get going…
BABETTE: I'm not a sleepwalker…
LORELAI: No.
BABETTE: …in case that's what you were thinking.
LORELAI: No no…
BABETTE: Cause a lot of people figure me for one. God knows why, I guess I got the look
LORELAI: Well, you didn't sleepwalk, though.
BABETTE: Hunh-unh. But this morning I came over here wide awake 'cause I heard Paul Anka doing that weird yodeling noise that you said he does when he's hungry, so I fed him.
LORELAI: Oh good thank you. I gave him a half a cup of that kibble that you said he likes, but then he looked at me like I stole something from him, so I gave him a whole cup.
LORELAI: I know that look. It can be intimidating.
BABETTE: And since our washing machine is broken -- Morey put his boots in it and broke it again -- I thought I'd do a load of my intimates.
LORELAI: Good for you.
BABETTE: You ain't got any messages.
LORELAI: What?
BABETTE: He didn't call.
LORELAI: Who?
BABETTE: I heard about the fight between you and Luke.
LORELAI: [Sighs] You did?
BABETTE: You know Adrian Bittenberg's daughter, Becky? She got a huge mouth.
LORELAI: Becky is not a gossip.
BABETTE: But she has a huge mouth. And she and Eileen Whitewin were behind Doose's market seeing how many devil dogs Becky could stuff in there, and when she got up to four, completely cut off her oxygen. So Eileen went running over to Luke's to see if she could get some help, and then she saw the two of you screaming at each other.
LORELAI: I'm glad she had the presence of mind to listen in on our argument while her friend was choking to death.
BABETTE: Well don't you worry about a thing. Everything will be fine. Every couple needs a good blowout once in awhile. It keeps you on your toes.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, well...
BABETTE: Yeah. So, did you spend the night at Sookie's again?
LORELAI: Sookie's?
BABETTE: Yeah, I figured you were there, but Morey and I did a power walk this morning, and we went by her and Jackson's place, and I didn't see your jeep there.
LORELAI: Babette, I really got to get going.
BABETTE: Oh, I'm just waiting for my panties to dry. [a moments silence] I'll pick them up later. But could you do me a favor and put them in a delicate-spin situation, 30 minutes with a bounce dryer sheet? Oh, and don't worry, sweetheart. He'll call. They always do.
YALE DAILY NEWS ROOM - HALLWAY
[Rory at Yale comes to the news offices and see a number of people waiting outside, there is a sign "SAT Prep" and Paris is running it. Rory enters the news room]
YALE DAILY NEWS ROOM
PARIS: Do you want your kid to spend her life behind the counter at Dunkin' Donuts? Do you?
MARILYN: No.
PARIS: Because that's where she's headed, selling chocolate donuts and glazed fritters for the next 40 years to people in business suits who actually gave a crap about their academic future.
MARILYN: I just want her to get into a good school. She has such potential.
PARIS: Well so did Charles Manson.
MARILYN: What?
PARIS: Look at her. Frankly, it may already be too late. I don't like to take on such meek, diffident cases. Do you even know what "diffident" means? [the mother and daughter look confused] That's okay. That knowledge isn't really required in the retail doughnut-distribution industry.
MARILYN: Please, just give her a chance.
PARIS: Why should I?
MARILYN: Because she needs this.
CAITLYN: Mom.
MARILYN: Caitlyn. What do you think?
PARIS: She's got a "c" average, which means she's either lazy or stupid. I can work with either. Frankly, sometimes stupid is easier. I can scare the stupid out of you, but the lazy runs deep.
MARILYN: So you'll take her on?
PARIS: I will.
MARILYN: Wonderful.
CAITLYN: Mom!
MARILYN: Caitlyn.
MARILYN: Thank you, Paris. You won't be sorry.
PARIS: Okay. Now, if I can get you both to take these aptitude tests, then we can get to work.
MARILYN: Why do I need to take a test?
PARIS: I need to get a realistic sense of Caitlyn's true potential, and genetics is by far the most reliable indicator.
MARILYN: I'm sorry?
PARIS: Basically I need to know how much of this is her fault and how much is yours. [puts a clock on the table] Ticktock.
MARILYN: Oh!
RORY: What is this?
PARIS: Pretty great, huh?
RORY: Not for Caitlyn.
PARIS: I was gonna spend the summer tutoring for the Princeton review, but then I found they charge these little morons $60 an hour and only pay their tutors $20. So I figured, "who needs the Princeton review?" I can open up my own shop. I've already subcontracted out to three other student tutors, and I've got more prospects lined up. I'm gonna make a fortune. Hey, are you interested? The pay's $15 an hour.
RORY: No, thanks.
PARIS: Wait. Are you looking to use the offices over the summer? Just because you're the editor, that doesn't entitle you to use the offices during the summer. There's not paper to put out. [raises her voice] These were up for grabs, and I grabbed them.
RORY: Paris, I don't want the offices.
PARIS: Oh. Then, what are you doing here?
RORY: I just came in to back up my files.
PARIS: You already backed up your files. I saw you do it. Oh. I get it. Logan's gone, huh?
RORY: He left this morning, early.
PARIS: Breakups are tough.
RORY: What?
PARIS: Eyes on your own paper! Marilyn
RORY: We didn't break up.
PARIS: You didn't?
RORY: No. Why would you say that?
PARIS: I don't know, wealthy, good-looking, hedonistic heir to billion-dollar, multinational media conglomerate moves to London and spends nights pining away for his college girlfriend? Who's watching that movie?
RORY: Paris, it's not like that. We're together.
PARIS: So you guys talked about it?
RORY: Yes. Well, no… I mean, I'm gonna go visit him, though. We talked about that.
PARIS: When?
RORY: I don't know exactly.
PARIS: So what, specifically, did you agree to?
RORY: Well, nothing, really, but it was kind of understood.
PARIS: Yeah. Because that worked out so well the last time.
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: Has history taught you nothing? You're in limbo, sister, no man's land, quite literally. Logan is not that bright. You need to spell it out. He's got to know where the red lines are, or he's gonna leap right over them and into bed with multiple British floozies.
RORY: Paris, it's okay. Logan and I are fine.
PARIS: He moved to London, Rory… the most romantic city in the world.
RORY: Paris is the most romantic city in the world.
PARIS: Oh, right. London is just the most sex-obsessed.
[Alarm rings]
PARIS: Pencil's down!
LORELAI'S HOUSE - OUTSIDE
[Lorelai comes out and sees Luke]
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: I can't. I'm late for work.
LUKE: Can we talk first?
LORELAI: Please I really don't want to.
LUKE: Lorelai, come on.
LORELAI: No, Luke, we did talk. We talked last night. There's nothing left to say.
LUKE: Look I'm sorry about yesterday, but you kinda ambushed me out of no where, and then you didn't give me a chance.
LORELAI: I gave you every chance.
LUKE: You were going so fast.
LORELAI: Yeah, that's me. I'm fast. I'm the perfect storm of caffeine and genetics. Ha-ha.
LUKE: Now I've had a chance to catch up, and I want to discuss it.
LORELAI: Discuss what? There's nothing left to discuss.
LOGAN: Us, you and me.
LORELAI: There is no us. There's you, and there's me. It's over. It was over last night, and it's over now. It's over.
LUKE: Lorelai…
LORELAI: No, I'm sorry. I have to go. [she gets in to the Jeep and leaves]
DRAGONFLY INN – KITCHEN
[Sookie and Michel are arm-wrestling]
MICHEL: [grunting] You're going down.
SOOKIE: No.
MICHEL: You think you're so great. You think you're miss la-di-da.
SOOKIE: Ow.
MICHEL: But look at you now, all weak and pitiful.
SOOKIE: Ugh!
MICHEL: That's it. Give in to the pain.
SOOKIE: So, how's my acting?
MICHEL: What do you mean?
SOOKIE: Well, is it believable, or do you find it a little over-the-top?! [Sookie slams her hand down to win]
MICHEL: Aah! My fingers! My fingers are smashed!
SOOKIE: Ha! How do you like them apples, Michel?
MICHEL: I do not like these apples. You cheated. You hustled me. You played possum.
SOOKIE: Oh, no, I played arm-wrestling. Or did you think we were playing some other game? Is that why you lost so bad?
MICHEL: Your gloating is very distasteful. Ouch! [Lorelai enters] Lorelai, I may need to take some time off to have my wrist x-rayed. Excuse me.
SOOKIE: [singing] I am the champion, my friend and I'll keep on fighting till the end no time for losers. Oh! I am a fantastic arm-wrestler. You know what I think did it? The whisking, all those years of whiskin has given me incredible forearm strength. People are always like, "why take the time to hand-whip fresh cream? Why not use a machine?" And I've always been like, "I don't know why I do it. It's just something that I do." But now I know -- because I've been training for this very day. I mean, wow! I am strong. And the omelet flipping definitely is part of it. You know when you use one of those really heavy cast-iron k*ll, and you flip, flip? That's all in the wrist, you know? And that's what they say. That's what people say about arm-wrestling, too - that it's all in the wrist, and, man, I have super-bionic, superpowered, super wrists. I mean, who knew I possessed such, honey? Something's wrong, huh?
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: It's not spiders on the ceiling. You know I hate spiders. I was kind of hoping it was spiders.
LORELAI: It's not spiders.
SOOKIE: No?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: Luke and I are over.
SOOKIE: Over?
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: No.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Have you guys had a fight?
LORELAI: We had the fight.
SOOKIE: People have fights. It's okay. It's good, actually. You know, it's healthy. If you don't have fights, all these bad chemicals build up, and you get ulcers and bad skin. You got such pretty skin, so you have to have some fights for the sake of your skin.
LORELAI: This was different. This was bad.
SOOKIE: People have bad fights. Every bad fight can seem like "the fight."
LORELAI: It wasn't just a fight, Sookie. It was him not fighting for me. I gave him an ultimatum,
SOOKIE: And?
LORELAI: And he let me walk away.
SOOKIE: No. He'll come back. He'll be back. He'll come back. Luke wants to marry you. I know he does. I mean, he'll come around. He'll get it together.
LORELAI: I'm done. I don't want to see him anymore. It's over.
SOOKIE: I get that you're mad. You deserve to be mad. Luke's been a real jerk. Frankly, being mad at him makes all the sense in the world. And if you're so mad that you need to believe you guys are over, I get that.
LORELAI: Sookie, I spent the night with Christopher last night.
SOOKIE: You spent the night with Christopher?
LORELAI: Spent the night.
SOOKIE: With Christopher?
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Okay so, does Luke know?
LORELAI: No. I don't want him to ever know.
SOOKIE: That's good. That's good. Uh, okay. Uh, look - things happen. People...people do things. It's not pretty. It's not Disney, but it's the real world. And you don't have to tell him. Luke doesn't have to know, and things don't have to be over.
LORELAI: No, you don't get it. I need it to be over. I need it to be over because I can't take this anymore. Yes, I love Luke, and, yes, I wanted to marry Luke. But I didn't want a life separate from Luke, and that's all he could give me. I don't want that. If I'm gonna be with Luke, I want to be with Luke, and he didn't get it, and I waited. I mean, god, I waited. It's like Luke is driving a car, okay, and I just want to be in the passenger's seat. But he's locked the door, and and so I have to hold onto the bumper, you know? I'm not even asking him to open the door for me. Just leave it unlocked and say, "come in." But no, he didn't do that, so I'm hanging onto the bumper, and life goes on, and the car goes on, and I get really badly bruised and hitting potholes. And it hurts. I mean, it hurts. So yesterday I had to let go of the bumper because it hurts too much. It hurts too much.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LUKE'S DINNER
LUKE: Caesar where the hell is lane?
CAESAR: She's on her honeymoon.
LUKE: Jeez how long is that gonna last?
CAESAR: It's only been a week.
LUKE: Only? Seven days seems like plenty of time to sit in some mountain cabin together and realize you've just chained yourself to another human being for all eternity.
CAESAR: They went to Mexico, so they're probably doing that on a beach. Maybe it takes a little longer to realize with the hot sun and all.
LUKE: Caesar are you being funny?
CAESAR: You tell me.
LUKE: No, you tell me.
CAESAR: It would appear not.
LUKE: Bus those tables.
CUSTOMER: Luke, I asked for these eggs scrambled, and they're sunny-side up.
LUKE: [Luke takes a fork and starts scrambling the eggs] There you go. [Luke hears a truck beep and looks out side] Oh, now what? Caesar, I'll be right back.
CAESAR: Don't hurry.
OUTSIDE THE DINER
TAYLOR: Now, carefully. That's rental equipment. I'm responsible for that.
LUKE: Taylor, what the hell are you doing?
TAYLOR: Good morning, Lucas. You look in fine fettle today.
LUKE: Okay whatever you're doing, stop it.
TAYLOR: That's rather cynical. Now, who's to say I'm not doing something that will surprise and delight you?
LUKE: Are you?
TAYLOR: I highly doubt it.
LUKE: Then stop it.
TAYLOR: Can't do it, Luke. The safety of the citizens of stars hollow is at stake, and that has to be my top priority, regardless of how you feel about a red-light camera.
LUKE: A what?
TAYLOR: To catch scofflaws. Apparently, people are viewing our traffic light here as more a series of colorful driving suggestions rather than the rules of the road. Therefore, I decided to install a red-light camera to discourage drivers who would test our laws and photograph and punish those who do.
LUKE: A camera?
TAYLOR: You run a red light, it's time for your close-up, Mr. Demille. These little wonders are taking over the globe -- New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Singapore.
LUKE: That's ridiculous.
KIRK: They're in position and ready for the installation. At you say so.
LUKE: No you can't do this. It's an invasion of privacy.
KIRK: Something to fear, Luke?
LUKE: You can't take pictures of people for driving by the diner. It's probably not even legal.
KIRK: Spoken like a man with something to hide.
TAYLOR: Luke I can assure you that I am well within my rights as town selectman to install that camera, and you, of all people, should be grateful. After all, it'll make the street in front of your diner that much safer.
KIRK: Or unsafer is you know what I mean…
LUKE: There hasn't been an accident on that corner in 15 years.
TAYLOR: And now we've made it safe for the next 15. Hooray!
LUKE: I'm gonna fight you on this.
TAYLOR: We will be having the official unveiling ceremony later this afternoon. You're welcome to attend.
LUKE: Well I don't see how I can avoid it. Considering it's right in front of my damn diner!
KIRK: I'll put you down for plus one.
TAYLOR: Oh and we're going to have to cross up some electrical lines during the installation process, so you might lose power for a few hours.
[Luke looks mad, turns and walks away]
DRAGONFLY INN
RORY: Hi.
LORELAI: [Gasps] What?! The prodigal daughter returns. What are you doing here?
RORY: I couldn't stay away. I just missed you too much.
LORELAI: Aren't you the sweetest? Isn't she the sweetest, Michel?
MICHEL: Beyond all human understanding.
RORY: Hi, Michel.
MICHEL: Yes, it hurts very much.
LORELAI: Yay! So you're back.
RORY: Yeah. I just had to get out of there.
LORELAI: Aw. How was the goodbye?
RORY: Awful. There's nothing good about a goodbye. It's a very poorly named ritual. It was a bad bye, a very bad bye. Then I went to the newsroom to talk to Paris about it…
LORELAI: You what?
RORY: Well I didn't mean to. She was just there, and she spent like 10 minutes kicking me while I was down.
LORELAI: Paris is always there for you in the most unfortunate ways.
RORY: I just miss him so much.
LORELAI: I know you do.
RORY: And it's only been seven hours. Can you imagine when it's been - you know what? I don't want to talk about it. I need coffee.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: You sure, though, you don't want to talk? You can always vent to me. I'm the perfect vent-erizer - vent-erator.
RORY: Mom, I don't need a vent-erator. I just don't want to talk about it. What's going on with you?
LORELAI: Oh. With me? Oh, well, things with me - things with me are good.
RORY: Convincing.
LORELAI: Things with me friends are good. Things with me inn are good. Things with me, not so good.
RORY: What's up?
LORELAI: Look I don't want to talk about this, but I want to tell you. I have to tell, but I'm barely holding it together as it is. So if I tell, will you promise not to make me discuss it?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: [Sighs] Luke and I split up.
RORY: What do you mean, like you got into a fight?
LORELAI: No, we had a breakup, a real-life parting of the hearts.
RORY: Why? What happened?
LORELAI: Rory, you promised.
RORY: No, I didn't.
LORELAI: Well, it was implied. Please.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: I don't want to talk about it.
RORY: But you have to explain.
LORELAI: No, not right now, okay? Look - you got to not talk about your thing. So I didn't vent-erator you. You don't vent-erator me.
RORY: But…
LORELAI: Rory, please.
RORY: Well, you know, I guess we don't have to talk about stuff.
LORELAI: Yeah. Who says we always have to be talking? We can not talk.
RORY: Of course we can.
LORELAI: Okay…We should probably talk about how we're not gonna talk, 'cause I don't think we should just go right into it.
RORY: Let's do something that doesn't require talking. Like we could go to the movies.
LORELAI: You want to try not talking at a movie?
RORY: Okay, shopping.
LORELAI: Are you mad?
RORY: We could drink. We could go to a bar and just throw back a few.
LORELAI: Yeah, drunk people never feel like talking. Oh! We could go to a club.
RORY: Yeah, 'cause all the hot spots get rolling about lunchtime.
LORELAI: See? This is why men play sports.
RORY: Sports we can play sports.
LORELAI: We hate sports.
RORY: We haven't tried every sport.
LORELAI: How about running?
RORY: We could easily talk while we're running. Not if we were hurdling. Hurdles require more focus and, thus, less talking. Or we could do that running that's like you leap around a tree and up a hill…
RORY: You want to run cross-country.
LORELAI: Not across the whole country, maybe just Michigan.
RORY: Michel, what sports do you play?
MICHEL: Well, since I'm maimed potentially for life, I may never play sports again.
LORELAI: But think back to before this tragic, life-altering injury, when life was still worth living What sports did you play then?
MICHEL: Well, Pilates, of course.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: It's like yoga with cables and wires.
LORELAI: Sounds very dangerous.
MICHEL: Oh, racquetball is also a fantastic workout.
LORELAI: Racquetball?
RORY: Intriguing.
LORELAI: I always liked the sound of racquetball.
RORY: Tell us more about this racquetball.
MICHEL: Well, it's very simple - a 4-walled room, a racquet, and a rubber ball.
LORELAI: Get to the good part, what are the clothes like?
RORY: Can we wear cute outfits?
MICHEL: I do.
LORELAI: I think racquetball sounds great.
RORY: Mmm, I'm in.
LORELAI: Okay, good. Well go home. And I need to finish up a few things around here. I'll see you there in about an hour.
RORY: Deal. Yeah, fun.
LORELAI: Okay. And no talking.
RORY: Except for smack talking because I am so gonna kick your butt in racquetball. NO no I mean, my balls - they're gonna bounce way further than your balls.
LORELAI: Okay, well, you haven't seen my great top... flick wrist…
RORY: We'll learn the terms.
LORELAI: Go home and study.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S ROOM
[Rory is unpacking finds the rocket and stands it on the desk, Cell phone ringing]
RORY: Hello?
LOGAN: Miss me?
RORY: Logan, where are you?
LORELAI: Heathrow. I just landed.
RORY: I miss you so much.
LOGAN: I miss you, too. I've been here 2 1/2 minutes, and I can already tell it sucks.
RORY: It does suck. I've heard that about London. You should just get on a plane and come home. You gave it a chance.
LOGAN: Are you on campus, I tried you at the apartment, but I didn't get an answer.
RORY: No, I'm back at stars hollow. That apartment suddenly felt very big and empty.
LOGAN: So, what are you gonna do?
RORY: Oh, going to play racquetball with my mom.
LOGAN: This is a bad connection. It sounded like you were gonna play racquetball with your mom.
RORY: Hey, I could have a hidden talent for it, you never know.
LOGAN: Did you open my gift?
RORY: Of course.
LOGAN: What did you think?
RORY: I thought...wow.
LOGAN: Yeah, pretty cool, right?
RORY: So cool.
LOGAN: Oh, I'm glad you like it.
RORY: Like it? [Chuckles] I love it.
LOGAN: I'm so glad you got it.
RORY: Oh, yeah, totally.
LOGAN: When I left, I suddenly got worried you wouldn't get it.
RORY: Yeah of course. Of course, I got it. I loved it.
LOGAN: I knew you would. Alright Ace, I got to go. I just wanted to tell you I touched down. I'll call later.
RORY: Okay, bye. And thank you.
LOGAN: Of course.
[Rory looks at the rocket]
RACQUETBALL COURT
[Rory and Lorelai are sitting on the floor talking]
LORELAI: Like a remote-control rocket?
RORY: No, like a model rocket.
LORELAI: How big? [Rory raises here hand about 2 foot off the floor] Is it filled with anything? Gum or candy or anything?
RORY: Gum.
LORELAI: What? Rocket gum. It could be a thing.
RORY: There was no gum in it.
LORELAI: It doesn't have a button you can push?
RORY: No, nothing like that. It's just a model rocket. I mean, what could that mean? Who gives someone a rocket?
LORELAI: I don't know. I don't know. We'll figure it out, though. Rocket, rocket, rocket. Rocket man -- "rocket man." Hee "Crocodile rock" was good. "Bennie and the jets," "candle in the wind."
RORY: Are you just naming Elton John songs?
LORELAI: He is just so talented.
RORY: Ugh. What about space?
LORELAI: It's the final frontier?
RORY: Oh, no.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: What if he was trying to say that he wanted space away from me?
LORELAI: No. [Two guys come into the court] Oh, hi, we're not done racquetballing. We've got it for like an hour. Thanks, though.
RORY: Hey, maybe it's code. Like I'm his rocket, right? Like I'm his rock, E.T. I'm his rock in the eastern time zone.
LORELAI: That's dumb.
RORY: Yeah, like rocket gum is sweeping the nation.
LORELAI: When I have made $1 zillion from my rocket-gum invention, you will eat those words. Or more likely, chew those words and blow a bubble with them, 'cause did I mention that rocket gum is bubble gum? But instead of blowing bubbles, it releases helium that sh**t the chewer up into space.
RORY: I don't think this is helping me understand the state of my relationship with Logan. And we're not even supposed to be talking.
LORELAI: You started it.
RORY: I did start it. So maybe now you would like to talk about Luke?
LORELAI: You know what, I'd rather racquetball.
RORY: Seriously?
LORELAI: Come on. [She puts on a head band and they get up] What do you think? Against the wall?
RORY: Yeah, why not.
LORELAI: Okay. Ready?
RORY: Ready.
LORELAI: [hits the ball which bounces back and hits her in the eye] Ow!
RORY: You okay?
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: We're done.



LORELAI'S HOUSE - BATHROOM
RORY: See, it's starting to swell.
LORELAI: It is starting to swell. Either that or the rest of my face is shrinking.
RORY: I think we should put something on it.
LORELAI: Uh, concealer and loose powder?
RORY: Ice mum, I think we should put ice on it.
LORELAI: So boring. Neosporin and an eye patch? Bactine, bacitracin, hydrogen peroxide. Winnie the pooh band-aids?
RORY: I'm getting you some ice.
LORELAI: Good lord. Where'd I get all this stuff?
LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
RORY: How can you not have ice?
LORELAI: You know I don't cook.
RORY: That is not cooking. That is the opposite of cooking. That's freezing. All you have in here are like batteries and film and something I think used to be an ice cream sandwich.
RORY: How old is that film?
LORELAI: Ugh, 1999. Bad hair year for me, skirts were the wrong length, cut me right at the calf. I can't bring myself to develop it.
RORY: You're not putting shaving cream on your eye.
LORELAI: No, just getting rid of some of Luke's things…Steak.
RORY: Huh?
LORELAI: Steak is supposed to be good for a black eye.
RORY: Frozen peas.
LORELAI: Why would I put peas in my eye?
RORY: No, like a bag of frozen peas. It molds to the contour of your face.
LORELAI: But steak has actual healing properties. Something about the juices or the fats is good for the skin.
RORY: I'm going to Doose's to get you some ice.
LORELAI: And steak. And peas. And ice cream! That would feel good on my eye. And then when I'm done using it, we can eat it. It's black-eye dinner.
RORY: Says the woman who can't cook ice.
LORELAI: Please. I'm not gonna cook. I'm too injured. You cook. And get some Bacitracin. Whatever we use it for, we're almost out.
RORY: Be right back.
[Rory hands Lorelai a bettery.]
LORELAI: Thanks…See if he has eye patches.
RED LIGHT CAMERA – OUTSIDE THE DINER
TAYLOR: Okay, everyone, gather 'round. Witness the miracle of modern...
LUKE'S DINER
LUKE: Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
CUSTOMER: What.
LUKE: Does this look like a soup kitchen?
CUSTOMER: It's a little depressing, but no…
LUKE: Pay your bill.
CUSTOMER: Oh, oh, right, sorry. I wasn't trying to skip out or anything. [hands Luke the money.
LUKE: Get lost. [Sighs, Caesar comes in to stand by Luke, they look at each other few seconds of silence] Well there's nobody left to serve, and I certainly don't want your company.
CAESAR: Thanks, Luke.
OUTSIDE AGAIN
RORY: Hi, Miss Patty. Hey, Gypsy. Hi, Lulu.
MISS PATTY: Rory!
LULU: Hi, Rory.
GYPSY: Look at the college girl. You home for the summer?
RORY: I am
MISS PATTY: You look wonderful. If I had known that college was so good for the complexion, I might have cracked a book open when I was younger.
RORY: Oh, thanks.
LULU: Your mom said you might be traveling in Asia.
GYPSY: She's not in Asia.
MISS PATTY: I didn't know you were going to Asia.
RORY: Well I was talking about it, but that's not gonna happen.
GYPSY: Well your mom must be happy to have you home.
RORY: Yeah, she is. What's going on here?
LULU: Taylor's putting a camera on the traffic light.
GYPSY: Big brother is watching.
TAYLOR: Okay, everyone. Thanks for coming. Now, as you know, small-town law enforcement presents many challenges. Chief among them, how to police our streets without an actual police force. Fortunately for the citizens of stars hollow, the fine people [Rory looks over to Luke's and Luke looks back, they wave to each other.] at Ingram traffic systems have provided an answer. I would now like to present the latest and greatest w*apon in unmanned high-tech law enforcement. Ladies and gentlemen, the Auto Patrol P.R. 100. [Applause] How it works is very simple. When someone drives through the red light, the camera will take three successive pictures of the offending party at closer and closer range.
GYPSY: Seems kind of intrusive to me.
TAYLOR: Law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about. Now, we are going to have our ceremonial first lawbreaker played by Kirk. [Car horn honks] Kirk will drive my classic 1964 Ford Thunderbird down the street, through the red light, and the Auto Patrol P.R. 100 will capture him in all his law-breaking glory. Miss patty?
MISS PATTY: I'm on it.
[Miss Patty gets up and signals Kirk to drive by dropping a hanky, He's off the camera starts flashing, Kirk can't see, the crowd panics as he goes out of control and into the diner, Luke watches in disbelief as he crashes through the wall and ducks behind the counter. Rory and the crowd looks on in shock. Luke gets up from behind the counter. Kirk gets out of the car.]
KIRK: I'm okay! I'm okay!
[the crowd rushes over to take a closer look.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
RORY: Okay, do you remember when you begged me to go see "the fast and the furious" with you, and I said no? And then you begged me to go see "the fast and the furious 2" with you, and I said no? Then "the fast and the furious 3: Tokyo drift" came out...
LORELAI: Cars, they drift.
RORY: And I was like, "I said no to 1 and I said no to 2 - "what do you think happened here, I got a brain transplant or something?"
LORELAI: I remember. You were very rude.
RORY: Well, I was wrong, because I have finally understood the awesomeness of cars crashing into things, which is a long-winded way of saying that Taylor installed this red-light camera in front of Luke's, and Kirk was supposed to demonstrate how it worked, but he got totally blinded by the camera, and he ended up crashing Taylor's fancy blue t-bird -- which, by the way, who knew? -- Into the side of Luke's. And nobody was hurt. Everything was fine. But the smash-up was unbelievable. And it went right into Luke's and then Kirk gets up, he gets out of the car, and he's all like, Evel Knievel style, like, "I'm okay, I'm okay." And...um... why is everything you own in piles all over the floor?
LORELAI: No no wait. Into the diner and nobody was hurt?
RORY: Yeah, everything's fine. But what is this?
LORELAI: There must've been a lot of damage. Are you sure everybody's okay?
RORY: It was a mess, but everything's fine, I swear. What is this?
LORELAI: Umm I'm just getting some of Luke's stuff together.
RORY: This is Luke's?
LORELAI: No, this is mine. But I wore it with Luke when we went to see "jarhead." I was trying to look kind of army, and something about the combination of the movie and the hot dogs at the Waterbury Cineplex made me sick in the parking lot, and Luke held my hair, and it was nice, and now I got to get rid of it.
RORY: Oh.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Yeah, this pile is Luke's stuff. This pile is stuff that reminds me of Luke.
RORY: What's that pile?
LORELAI: Those are Babette's intimates.
RORY: Of course. So, all these books remind you of Luke?
LORELAI: Yeah, those are books I gave him to read, but he never did.
RORY: Cormac McCarthy - good call. "In cold blood" - he would have loved that. Well, he'll never know now. You wanted him to read "hammerhead sharks - demons of the deep"? He recommended that one for me. Pom-pom socks. Al's pancake world takeout menus. Hey, you're getting rid of bop it? And a spatula? Why? Oh, oh. 'Cause Luke used to make you breakfast.
LUKE: Well he did, but that's not why I'm getting rid of it. Although now that you mention it, the waffle iron has got to be dumped.
RORY: We have a waffle iron?
LORELAI: Don't get attached. It's got to go.
RORY: Spatula?
LORELAI: We were having an argument in the kitchen. And he said it was a fight, and I said it wasn't really a fight, it was a spat. He said there was no difference between a fight and a spat, and I said there was a huge difference because a fight cannot be diffused in the moment, but a spat can easily be diffused with the use of a spatula. And I took the spatula out of the drawer, and I whacked him with it a little bit, and he started laughing, and I started laughing, and now I got to get rid of it.
RORY: Sad.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Okay, what happened between you two? You have got to give me something here, because you cannot just say that you don't want to talk about it, because I saw Luke today, and I waved at him, and I did not know how to act. Was it an "I hate you" wave, or an "I'm sorry" wave, or "I can't believe you wanted my mother to shave her head and become a Moonie" wave.
LORELAI: He doesn't want me to shave my head. You shouldn't hate him. There's nothing to be angry about. You knew we were having problems, right? The whole April thing and postponing the wedding. Finally, I got tired of waiting for him, so I gave him an ultimatum. And he said no. So, that's it. It's over. Here I am, making piles. The third stage of grief is making piles.
RORY: Steak or peas?
LUKE'S DINER - EXTERIOR
[Luke and Taylor are looking over the crash]
TAYLOR: No, no, no - this is not my fault!
LUKE: This is all your fault, all of it!
TAYLOR: Lucas I understand why you're perturbed.
LUKE: Perturbed? Do I seem perturbed? I am so far past perturbed that I couldn't look behind me and see perturbed with a telescope. You never listen to anybody, Taylor. You just barrel along and decide what's best for everybody, consequences be damned.
TAYLOR: Now, I grant you the ceremony today did not go according to plan.
LUKE: According to plan? There's a car in my diner - a freaking car, Taylor. A two-door 1965 Ford Thunderbird in my diner.
TAYLOR: Actually, it's a '64.
TOW TRUCK DRIVE: So, you want me to move it out or not?
TAYLOR: I would advise waiting until our insurance agents arrived.
TOW TRUCK DRIVE: It's up to you, pal. It's on your property.
LUKE: I don't know yet!
TAYLOR: You could have some sympathy. After all it's my car that crashed, my most prized possession. I mean, the paint job alone is gonna cost me a fortune, and who knows what other damage has been done or what my insurance will or won't cover?
LUKE: Well maybe I'll come back with a sledgehammer, and you can tell them you totaled the thing.
TAYLOR: Now Luke I would strongly advise against any rash action that could lead to undue and costly litigation.
THEY MOVE INSIDE
LULU: How about now?
KIRK: Giant red spots. Nothing but giant red spots.
TAYLOR: How's it look under there, Gypsy?
GYPSY: Well, the car is fine. It definitely wasn't faulty brakes that caused the accident. Kirk is just an idiot.
KIRK: Hey, I resent that. Who was that? Damn giant red spots.
TOW TRUCK DRIVE: What do you want to do here, buddy? You want to pull the car out or wait for the insurance guy?
LUKE: I don't know I'm not sure what I want to do yet.
TOW TRUCK DRIVE: Well I need to know now. I can't spend all day here. Either we move the car right now, or I take off, you leave it in here, and wait for the insurance guys. You got to decide.
LUKE: Look, do not pressure me, okay? I do not like being pressured. It's not one or the other. I need to think. Will you people just give me some time to think?
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[The room is almost empty, Crickets chirping, they are sitting on the couch.]
LORELAI: Soothing.
RORY: Very.
LORELAI: Zen.
RORY: Thoreau, Walden pond… Oh, I have an idea. [Rory gets up]
LORELAI: Huh? Maybe I should just go to Ikea. [Rory comes back with the rocket, Lorelai gasps] I like it.
RORY: Yeah. Maybe you can use it as the basis for your redecorating. Use it as a jumping-off point. Make everything kind of gray and shiny.
LORELAI: Well, it doesn't remind me of Luke at all.
RORY: That's my problem. It doesn't remind me of Logan either. It's so frustrating.
LORELAI: Why don't you call him?
RORY: Well I can't do that until I know what this is, what it means. See, this long-distance thing isn't working already.
LORELAI: Rory, he just left.
RORY: Exactly, and I'm already completely confused. I mean, I think we're still together, but that's what I thought last time we spent time apart. I was 100% sure that we were still together, and he was 100% sure that we had broken up, and then he ended up sleeping with those bridesmaids.
LORELAI: What is it you guys agreed to?
RORY: Well that's just it. Nothing, really. I mean, it was early in the morning, and we hadn't had a chance to decide on anything, and we hadn't had the talk. Now it's too late. He's thousands of miles away, and we talk on the phone, but we don't really say anything. And he's leaving me rockets.
LORELAI: Well It's not too late. He's been gone a day - less than a day. You guys will figure it out.
RORY: But it's hard on the phone, you know. I can't see him. I can't read his expression. How am I ever supposed to know what he's thinking or feeling? I mean his eyes always give him away. Logan has very expressive eyes.
LORELAI: I've noticed. It's one of the things he and Bette Davis have in common.
RORY: And sometimes he'll smile at me, and I can tell exactly how he's feeling, and now I can't.
LORELAI: So go to London.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Go to London. Go be with him this summer. The two of you were supposed to go traveling in Asia together anyway. You don't have any plans for the summer, so go.
RORY: I can't just go to London… Can I?
LORELAI: Why not? You two could have an amazing summer together in London. Pick up the phone. Call him.
RORY: I need to do some more Googling.
LORELAI: I'm going to bed. [gets up] So, Taylor's car is...
RORY: in Luke's diner.
LUKE‘S DINER
[Luke is sitting alone in the wrecked diner]
LORELAI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM
[Lorelai is on the bed read when she gets up and strips the bed the phone rings]
LORELAI: [Sighs] Hello.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, how you doing?
LORELAI: Fine.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm just checking in. Had a really great time last night. Don't worry. This is not a booty call.
LORELAI: It can't be, 'cause you're not 18, and it's not 1997.
CHRISTOPHER: Are you doing anything tomorrow night? 'Cause I was thinking maybe you could come over, and I could cook us some dinner.
LORELAI: Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Let's not make more out of it than it was.
CHRISTOPHER: So, you're saying last night was a booty call.
LORELAI: I'm just saying, I don't think it should happen again.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here for you if you need anything. You know that, right?
LORELAI: I - yeah, no - I appreciate...that.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay. I guess I'll say good night.
LORELAI: Yeah - night.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM
[Late night, the room is dark.]
RORY: I got it, I got it he loved her so much he was willing to wait 40 years alone in space for her. [turns on a light]
LORELAI: Hmm?
RORY: I got it. The rocket, I get it.
LORELAI: You do?
RORY: Yes. I have been Googling rockets, you know. Rocket ships, rocket love, rocket London, Logan rocket, and let me tell you, it has not always been a pleasant journey. People are freaks. But then I found this blog, rocket boy.
LORELAI: Rocket boy.
RORY: Rocket boy. Knows a ton about rockets. And as it turns out, he's got over 200 classic L.E.V.S.
LORELAI: L.E.V.S?
RORY: Lunar excursion vehicles. So then he tells me that he hosts this chat room, and this is where I get really lucky, because rocketchamp465 was just logging off, and I caught him, and I described the rocket to him, and he recognized it from one of these episodes of "the twilight zone."
LORELAI: [Whispering] "The twilight zone."
RORY: So I clicked on "the twilight zone" website, and I found the episode, and I got it!
LORELAI: I still have no idea what you're talking about.
RORY: Uh, when Logan and I were first going out, we were in the pool house one night really late, and we were falling asleep on the couch.
LORELAI: Wa wa wa.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Sorry.
RORY: Chachi, right?
LORELAI: Proud.
RORY: So, we were on the couch.
LORELAI: Wa wa wa.
RORY: And this episode of "the twilight zone" came on -- "the long morrow."
LORELAI: That's a bad title.
RORY: That's not the point.
LORELAI: I'm just saying.
RORY: So, there's this astronaut who was supposed to go into space for 40 years, but right before he left, he met this beautiful woman. But for those 40 years that he was going to be in space, he was going to be in suspended animation. So when he came back to earth, he was going to be really young, but she would be really old. So he goes into space, and when he does come back, the woman is still young and beautiful because she put herself in suspended animation to wait for him, but he's really, really old because he took himself out of suspended animation so he could be old with her.
LORELAI: How depressing.
RORY: He spent 40 years alone in space just waiting to see her, and he was willing to come back as an 80-year-old man, giving up almost his entire life just to spend those last few years with her.
LORELAI: Now, are you aware when you're in suspended animation, or is it just like a really long nap?
RORY: The point is, that this is Logan's favorite episode of "the twilight zone." And when we watched it together, he said, "that's true love." That's true love! This is the most romantic gift I've ever been given. I mean, I have to call him. I'm going to London. I am going to London.
LORELAI: Yay!
RORY: But -- wait, are you gonna be okay while I'm gone?
LORELAI: Yes, I'll be fine.
RORY: Okay, but we're going shopping for linens before I go.
RORY'S ROOM
LOGAN: Hello?
RORY: Hey!
LOGAN: Hey!
RORY: I'm sorry for calling so early. Did I wake you?
LOGAN: I'm actually at the office.
RORY: On a dare?
LOGAN: It's my first day, so I'm trying to make a good impression.
RORY: So you're, like, dressed and everything?
LOGAN: New suit, new shoes, even brushed my hair.
RORY: How's the office? Fabulous? Do you have a window?
LOGAN: I wouldn't say it's fabulous, but I do have a window.
RORY: Can you see the queen?
LOGAN: Actually, my window looks out on Piccadilly circus.
RORY: So, you can just see Elephants and clowns walking past your building all day long? That must be nice.
LOGAN: It's brilliant.
RORY: Brilliant? Oh, my god. You're turning British. Do you have a secretary named Moneypenny?
LOGAN: My secretary's name is Steven.
RORY: Steven Moneypenny?
LOGAN: [Laughs] Yes.
RORY: So...I just wanted to thank you for the rocket.
LORELAI: You already thanked me.
RORY: I know I did, but I wanted to do it again, because I'm not sure I conveyed how much I loved it in our last conversation. I really, really loved it.
LOGAN: I'm glad.
RORY: I can't wait to come see you, Logan. I can't wait.
LORELAI: I already got you a ticket.
RORY: You're kidding.
LOGAN: I got it right here. I was gonna Fedex it to you. You'll have it tomorrow.
RORY: Oh, my god!
LORELAI: So tell your mom you're not gonna be home for Christmas.
RORY: Christmas?
LOGAN: Two weeks, just you and me. I already cleared it with my dad. I'm still playing with the itinerary, but how do you feel about London, Paris, and Rome?
RORY: Wow.
LOGAN: I figured we'd do a week in London, then a quick train ride, and we do three days in Paris, and we finish our trip with a four-day sojourn in Rome. We still have enough time for one last night in London before you fly back home.
RORY: Logan, that sounds amazing.
LOGAN: Oh, hey, I should take off. My first staff meeting. They're waving me in.
RORY: Oh, okay, good luck.
LOGAN: Thanks, cheers.
RORY: Cheers.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - BEDROOM
[Lorelai wakes up to a car horn, she gets up and looks out the window]
LORELAI'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR
[Lorelai comes out side to see Luke with his truck full of stuff.]
LUKE: Uh...a car crashed into my diner yesterday. There's a giant hole where my wall used to be. It's gonna take a couple of weeks to fix. [Chuckles] It's a disaster, but I don't care. I mean, I care, but... you know what, no. I really -- I don't care. It's like it's not even real to me. It's like my life isn't even real to me unless you're there, and you're in it, and I'm sharing it with you. And, uh, I don't know what I was waiting for, and I don't know what I was scared of, but I'm not. I'm not scared, and I'm not waiting. I'm here.
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: No, don't say anything. I've got a t*nk full of gas, and Maryland is only 200 miles away, and I've made us some reservations at a couple of bed-and-breakfasts. I mean if you don't want to do the Maryland thing, we don't have to. I heard you say "Maryland" the other day. I don't know whether you were serious. I'm just trying to cover my bases here.
LORELAI: Luke…
LUKE: I also packed some camping equipment so we can head to Vermont or Maine and, you know, check into a cabin for a week, you know, like a little honeymoon thing. But maybe that's a little too rustic for your taste. Or we could drive to Atlantic city or even Las Vegas if you want to make a real road trip out of it.
LORELAI: Luke, stop.
LUKE: I also did some research, and we can we can also apparently use a sea captain, if you want. I'm not sure how big the boat has to be for it to be legal, but we can head to the coast, and we can knock on some doors, you know, boat doors. Yeah, that's probably not the most sensible way.
LORELAI: Just stop.
LUKE: But, no no, you were right. I need to be faster. I need to move faster, I need to think faster. And, well, here I am.
LORELAI: It's over.
LUKE: No, you can't say that. You can't just say that it's over. It's not over. You can't just decide that it's over. I'm in this, too. You know I'm not gonna let it be over. You said, "be ready now or never." I'm ready now.
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: Let's go. Let's do this. Let's get married right now. Let's go.
LORELAI: I slept with Christopher.
[Luke looks at Lorelai for a few seconds then gets into the truck slamming the door and drives off]

LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
[Lorelai is sitting at the table drinking coffee, she hears something gets up, sets some waffles cooking and pours a cut of coffee, then waits at Rory's bedroom door.]
LORELAI: Morning, Rory.
RORY: Please tell me you haven't been standing there all night.
LORELAI: [speaking quitly] I love you Rory.
RORY: Creepy. [hands her the coffee] Ooh, waffles?
LORELAI: I got up early this morning. I thought, "what better way to pass time than make some of my famous homemade waffles?"
RORY: I can't believe I forgot about your homemade waffles, seeing how famous they are.
LORELAI: Infamous, really.
RORY: So why'd you get up so early?
LORELAI: Mm, well, couldn't sleep. And, initially, I was at a loss. How would I pass the time until my one and only offspring, the fruit of my loins…
RORY: Too early.
LORELAI: ...Loin fruit that she is, straggled out of bed to grace me with her presence? But then I asked myself, "W.W.T.B.F.C.D.?" And it came to me in a flash. "I'm gonna make waffles."
RORY: "What would the barefoot Contessa do?"
LORELAI: Exactly
RORY: Barefoot's one word.
LORELAI: Shut up, loin fruit. So, what? Are you just sleepy or has last night's "my boyfriend gave me a love rocket" elation worn off?
RORY: It may have worn off a little bit.
LORELAI: Why? What happened? The love rocket was making you swoon for Logan last night.
RORY: I'm still plenty swoony. I just realized that the rocket doesn't mean I should be packing my bags for London.
LORELAI: Why? What happened?
RORY: Nothing happened, I just called Logan and I was like, "yeah, yeah. "Oh, I love the love rocket, you know? And I can't wait to come see you." And he was like, "oh, yeah, me too. Um, I'm gonna buy you a ticket for December."
LORELAI: Oh, no. Did you tell him you want to visit him now?
RORY: There wasn't really a point you know because I get it. He is starting his first real job. I mean, he needs time to adjust and focus and learn the lay of the land. I mean It's good that he's trying to be a grown-up. You no so now I'm trying to be a grown-up. So why am I gonna get all pouty because I don't get to do it?
LORELAI: Hmm. [Toaster pops] Well, that sounds like a real grown-up talking.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You know the one thing that grown-ups don't call themselves?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Grown-ups. Huh they say "adults," and they pronounce it "ah-dults."
RORY: It stinks!
LORELAI: Oh, it really stinks.
RORY: Stupid London! If he weren't in London right now, we would be on our Asia trip. I mean, I knew that it might not happen, but I hoped it would, and I just kept planning and planning and planning. [she gets up and goes to her room and bring back a pile of paper].
LORELAI: Wow. Were you planning on visiting Asia or invading it?
RORY: Look at all this wasted effort. All this highlighter ink? Wasted. All of these sticky notes? Wasted. We were going to see the terra-cotta soldiers in Xian. And we were going to go to Peking for the opera and the duck. I want to see Tibet. I want to snorkel off the an Thoi islands in Vietnam. I want to see the crazy teenage fashions in the Harajuku district of Tokyo.
LORELAI: Oh, wow.
RORY: Stupid london!
LORELAI: So, no Asia?
RORY: No Asia.
LORELAI: Well, I guess I got to go to stupid work. Here's one good piece of news. Lane called - she's back from her honeymoon.
RORY: Oh, yay!
LORELAI: She sounded kind of tired, which is good, I think. Tired after a honeymoon bodes well.
RORY: My married friend Lane and her married husband Zach. Nutso.
LORELAI: Hmm. Spoken like a true grown-up. Say "hey" to her for me. It's nice to have you home.
RORY: Bye.
LUKE'S DINER - EXTERIOR
[Luke pulls up in his truck, it now has building supplies and tools in it, Luke starts unpacking things.]
T.J.: Morning, Luke. You need a hand with this?
LUKE: Thanks.
T.J.: Sure thing. Just give me one second to savor this coffee. Ahh! So, how are you this lovely morning?
LUKE: Just fine.
T.J.: Hey, I got a coffee for you, too.
LUKE: Thanks.
T.J.: But then, as it became clear that you were most likely gonna be late, I didn't want it to get cold, so I drank it myself.
LUKE: I wasn't late.
T.J.: Who said you were late?
LUKE: You did, one second ago.
T.J.: Oh, no, I said you were mostly likely gonna be late, but it turns out you weren't. Who knew? Sounds like you need a little caffeine. What say you and I go over to the diner across the street and pick us up a nice cup of coffee?
LUKE: Forget it. I'm fine. [Luke stop] What diner across the street?
T.J.: This place - Kirk's. Great place. The owner's a real character and the coffee's fantastic. Come on, let me get you a cup, though maybe you ought to pay, seeing as I did pick us up the last round.
KIRK'S DINER - EXTERIOR?
[Kirk's is set up in the lawn across the street from Luke's with tables and a cooking area, Kirk is dress in flannel and a red backward baseball cap.]
KIRK: Eggs sunny side up with a side of bacon. And who's got the scrambled with hashbrowns? Here we go.
LUKE: What the hell is going on here?
KIRK: Welcome to Kirk's. I'll be right with you.
LUKE: What is this?
KIRK: It's a diner, Luke.
LUKE: A diner called Kirk's?
KIRK: It's the name my mother gave me. Top you off there, Jake?
LUKE: Why are you doing this?
LUKE: I just saw a need, and I filled it. Seamed to me Stars hollow was in want of a real neighborhood joint, a watering hole where the townsfolk could mingle, a place where a fella could come and get a piece of pie, a cup of Arbuckles', and a soupcon of small-town charm.
LUKE: Yeah, well, stars hollow has already got that place. It's right across the street. It's called Luke's. Luke's, ring any bells? Sounds a little like Kirk's doesn't it.
KIRK: If you are suggesting that you were the very first person to think of naming a restaurant after yourself, I think that Denny, Arby, and Tony Roma might have something to say about that, not to mention Mr. Chuck E. Cheese.
LUKE: Chuck E. Cheese is not a person.
KIRK: Luke do you think a giant mouse opened a restaurant franchise by himself?
LUKE: Look at this – French toast, pancakes, buttermilk pancakes. You stole my menu.
KIRK: You did not invent pancakes, Luke. Anyway, I heard Luke's went out of business.
LUKE: Luke's did not go out of business, Luke's is closed for repairs. And you want to know why it's closed? Because some nincompoop yesterday drove his car through my diner!
KIRK: Would you care to step outside for a moment, Luke?
LUKE: Outside? Outside what? [they walk "outside" and past a "no cell phone's" sign]
KIRK: I think it would behoove you not to use slanderous language like nincompoop in my place of business, Luke, because, let me tell you, it is only out of the kindness of my heart that I am not suing the pants off of you.
LUKE: Uh-hu you're gonna sue me after you crash a car into my diner and bust a giant hole in my wall?
KIRK: For all you know I could have brain damage.
LUKE: Oh, I'm pretty sure you do. You know what, Kirk? Go ahead. Sue me. Crash into my diner, make me lose a week's business, make me pay for the repairs, and then sue me for damages - for brain damages! That sounds fair!
KIRK: Luke, calm down. I get where you're coming from. I think we can work something out.
[He hands Luke a piece of paper]
LUKE: What is this?
KIRK: A job application. The way business is picking up, I'm totally gonna need a fry guy. What it sounded like your finances were kind of tight. If you came expecting a handout, you came to the wrong guy. I'm of the "teach a man to fish" school, Luke. [Luke crushes the paper into a ball and drops it on the ground.]U do not throw trash on the floor of a restaurant Luke. Not cool.
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Sookie is teaching Lorelai to cook]
SOOKIE: Okay, this is easy. Put in your snow crab. Put in your avocado. You put in your cucumber. You mash it together And then you just roll it up. Slice it up like this, and voil. Or whatever they say in Japan. Arigato.
LORELAI: Karate. It's those little coin shapes, just like in a Japanese restaurant. Arigato karate, babe.
SOOKIE: Yep. Okay. I'm gonna make one more California roll, and then we can make your meat-loaf sushi.
LORELAI: Yay, do you want to put suntan lotion in there?
SOOKIE: Did you just say sun - oh! Of course. Calfo, California roll would have some suntan lotion in it.
LORELAI: You're such a pity laugher. [tastes the food] Mmm! Good.
SOOKIE: Good!
LORELAI: So good! It's the best non-meat-loaf sushi I've ever had.
SOOKIE: Ooh! What about fried-chicken sushi?
LORELAI: With some slaw in it. That would be so good. Or chinese-food sushi. Or P.B.-And-J. Sushi.
SOOKIE: Or, hey, dessert sushi.
LORELAI: Oh, my god, that's genius. That is why you are the chef. That and because you're the one who can cook. So, um... hey, um... so I-I told him.
SOOKIE: Told who what? Telling him that?
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Are you saying told Luke about Christopher?
LORELAI: Yes. What did you think I was talking about?
SOOKIE: I don't know. I'm hoping there's something that I forgot, like maybe you were debating on whether or not to tell Kirk the difference between antiperspirant and deodorant. You told Luke about Christopher?
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: I thought you weren't going to.
LORELAI: I wasn't.
SOOKIE: Oh, honey, why?
LORELAI: Because Luke showed up at my house this morning with the truck fully packed, ready to elope.
SOOKIE: Oh, god, he did?
LORELAI: And he wouldn't take no for an answer, and so I had to tell him. That's the only way he was gonna believe me because it had to be no.
SOOKIE: Did it have to be? I mean, did the answer have to be no?
LORELAI: No. I mean, I guess I could be married right now to someone who doesn't want to be married to me and doesn't know that I slept with someone two nights before we got married.
SOOKIE: Well, when you put it that way... must have been horrible.
LORELAI: It was one of the most horrible moments of my whole life.
SOOKIE: Are you okay?
LORELAI: No. [Chuckles] I mean, no, not at all. I'm so very not fine, but what am I gonna do, you know? I have to be fine.
SOOKIE: Oh, honey.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT - EXTERIOR
[Zach comes out]
RORY: Hey, Zach. So, the honeymoon's over. Is the honeymoon over?
ZACH: What?
RORY: How was Mexico?
ZACH: Full of parasites.
RORY: Oh, gee, that's no good.
ZACH: The whole trip was a total fiasco. It was the Stones at Altamont times a billion.
RORY: But you and Lane were so excited about it. From the way you talked, I was half worried you'd start a mariachi band.
ZACH: Mexico sucks. And we were psyched. That's part of why it sucked so bad. I thought I found this amazing deal online. Right. Pedro's paradise. It all sounded good. The website said it had ocean views, its own kitchen, and a Jacuzzi. And nobody loves Jacuzzis more than me. Nobody. And then we get there, and it turns out Pedro's paradise is just this room in this dude Pedro's crappy apartment.
RORY: No. His apartment?
ZACH: 23 miles from the ocean, with a view of a billboard for Mexican nasal spray.
RORY: So the website lied.
ZACH: The kitchen we were promised - it smelled like Rice-a-Roni and was always full of Pedro's jerky friends listening to the devil's music, playing cards, and making snide remarks about us in code.
RORY: Pedro's friends talked in code?
ZACH: Well, Spanish, technically. Same difference. They knew I couldn't understand them. Pedro was evil, man.
RORY: Man.
ZACH: Anyway on the second day, I got some parasite, and I've been barfing Linda Blair style ever since. I'm getting better, but now it looks like Lane's got it.
RORY: Oh no.
ZACH: I'm heading over to Doose's right now to get some ginger ale and saltines, which by the way was all we ate in the way of Mexican food.
RORY: Oh, I'm sorry your trip was so sucky.
ZACH: Yeah, well, live and learn. Like, now I know not to drink the water in Mexico, which, by the way, somebody should really tell you. And I learned that I'm not morally against m*rder. I just wish I had the guts to do it.
RORY: Well, I'm glad you didn't k*ll Pedro. I mean, he's not worth it.
ZACH: Yeah, whatever.
[Zach leaves]
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR
[Brian is playing a video game, Rory comes in.]
RORY: Hello.
BRIAN: Hola, Rory.
RORY: Hola.
LANE'S ROOM
[Rory knock's on the door and enters]
RORY: Hey, sicko. Oh, welcome home. I heard Pedro's paradise wasn't so paradisey.
LANE: Mexico sucked.
RORY: Oh. But guess who I heard it from - your husband. Can we not squeal about that?
LANE: I don't really want to squeal. If you feel like squealing, go right ahead.
RORY: Of course you don't feel like squealing. You're sick.
LANE: I actually feel okay right now. My aversion to squealing is more emotional than physical.
RORY: I'm sorry your honeymoon was such a bummer.
LANE: On, like, the fourth day, Zach got so paranoid that Pedro and his friends were talking lasciviously about me in code that he lunged at Pedro - leapt at him from behind the door. Luckily, Zach was so weak from parasites that he missed - just flopped to the kitchen floor like he was a pancake someone threw across the room.
RORY: People throw pancakes?
LANE: I just stared at him lying on the floor and thought, "I just married that man."
RORY: And you didn't squeal for joy.
LANE: Nope. I went into the other room and stared at Pedro's poster of Spuds McKenzie hanging 20 and ate my 20th saltine of the day.
RORY: The whole trip sounds kind of rough.
LANE: Oh, you have no idea. What I just told you are the highlights compared to the real stuff.
RORY: No. What?
LANE: We can't talk here. The walls have ears.
RORY: And giant sombreros.
LANE: And big mouths. Let's go for a walk.
RORY: No your not feeling well, you should take care of yourself.
LANE: I'm feeling all right right now, actually. Um besides I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow, and if I start to barf in public, you could just pretend we were partying too hard.
RORY: Which would do wonders for my rep. All right, Mrs. Van Gerbig, let's blow this popsicle stand.
LUKE'S DINER - EXTERIOR
[Luke and T.J. are working on the damage]
T.J.: Okay. So tell me, what are we thinking about here?
LUKE: Well, the basic idea is to fix the giant hole.
T.J.: Yeah, but how? I've been thinking about it. I know I got a couple ideas about a log-cabin thing. I think what might really be nice is a giant stained-glass window.
LUKE: Yeah, I don't think so.
T.J.: Don't rule it out so quick. I can picture what you're picturing, like with all scary religious pictures. But it wouldn't have to be a bloody crucifixion. Or nothing it could just be an image of a happy animal. I don't know, a smiling penguin or... or perhaps a peaceful-looking giraffe.
LUKE: You think I should put up a stained-glass window of a peaceful-looking giraffe on the side of my diner?
T.J.: I'm just spitballing. Nothing's written in stone.
LUKE: Oh, well, that's good.
T.J.: How about diamond shapes?
LUKE: You know what, T.J.? Why don't we get to work?
T.J.: You're in a bit of a mood.
LUKE: I'm not in a mood, damn it.
T.J.: Okay! I'm sorry I said anything. I won't say anything else.
LUKE: You know what, T.J., Forget it. I'm sorry. I really appreciate the help you're giving me. I know it was last-minute. Okay?
T.J.: No problem, buddy. What are brother-in-laws for? Actually... I'm glad for an excuse to be out of the house. Because being pregnant makes liz incredibly horny.
LUKE: [getting mad and annoyed] T.J.
T.J.: Yeah, Luke?
LUKE: Can we not talk about my sister's sexuality?
T.J.: Oh, yeah. Well, sure. I guess it's something about all those hormones racing around in there. You should totally knock Lorelai up, though.
LUKE: T.J.
T.J.: What I'm not talking about your sister. I'm talking about your fiancée. I got a feeling pregnancy would make Lorelai particularly randy.
LUKE: T.J.!
T.J.: Just think how cool it would be if we raised our families together. You should get started now, though.
LUKE: Right.
T.J.: So how many kids you guys want?
LUKE: You know what I think I'm gonna go get the primer.
T.J.: Now?
LUKE: Yeah I'm just a.. worried about the hardware store running out ‘cause you know, it's the priming season.
T.J.: Good thinking.
LUKE: Yeah be right back.
T.J.: See you in a bit.
TOWN SQUARE - GAZEBO
LANE: So, now I know.
RORY: Know what?
LANE: That it's bad. It's terrible… Sex.
RORY: Oh. No. Sex was bad?
LANE: You can drop the act, Rory. It's okay. I've known the real deal about Santa Claus for years. Now I know about sex.
RORY: Lane…
LANE: You know what's funny? I really thought my mother was being an insane prude when she said that sex was horrible for women. But now I can see that, in fact, my mother was the only woman who wasn't willing to maintain this ridiculous, pervasive, media-supported charade.
RORY: What ridiculous, pervasive, media-supported charade?
LANE: That sex is normal. That sex is a wonderful part of life. That sex is sexy. I mean, can we just not admit it? Sex is not sexy. Sex is horrible.
RORY: Sex doesn't have to be horrible.
LANE: In a way, I'm impressed with the depth of the conspiracy. If you think about it, it says something about the potential power of women that the entire gender could collude in creating the "sex is sexy" myth.
RORY: So sex with Zach was bad?
LANE: Unbelievably bad.
RORY: Every time?
LANE: [Chuckling] Yeah, right. Every time.
RORY: You only did it once.
LANE: That's right, and I'm out.
RORY: Well, the first time can be weird. My first time definitely had its weird aspects, but it gets better. It gets good.
LANE: Um, sorry. I just don't believe you.
RORY: Um...okay. You have to walk me through what happened. I mean, not graphically, but help me out here.
LANE: Okay. So we decided that, for our first time, since it was such a big deal and everything, since we've been waiting and waiting and god, if I'd known what it was going to be like, I would have gladly kept waiting. But anyway we decided to re-create the scene in "From Here To Eternity."
RORY: Wow. Ambitious. Sex on the beach.
LANE: Anyway, the whole thing was a disaster. Because you know what movies don't tell you? That sand is basically dirt. It was dirty. It was cold. My hands were shaking. I'm trying to remember stuff about condoms and bananas. And then suddenly I realize, we got crabs, live ones that are scuttling all over us. Zach starts freaking out because, apparently, he's afraid of shellfish. And it's getting colder and dirtier. And at some point, this pervert with a snorkel mask appears out of nowhere. And I'm thinking, "we took three buses from Pedro's apartment for this."
RORY: Oh, Lane.
LANE: Yeah, just talking about it makes me feel sick and queasy.
RORY: Well, you are sick and queasy. You have a parasite. But, okay. Once you feel better, you should try sex again indoors in a bed.
LANE: I'm open to the idea of a sexless marriage. I mean it happens for some people, eventually. Why wait?
RORY: Try a bed first. Seriously. You would not believe what a comforter can do in this kind of situation.
LANE: Hey, aren't you supposed to be in Asia right now? How come you're not traipsing around Thailand with Logan?
RORY: Um, Logan's job started. He's far, far away in London.
LANE: You're lucky.
RORY: Yeah.
STARS HOLLOW - STREET
[Luke and Lorelai see each other across the street near the newsstand, Luke has pain cans and Lorelai has some shopping, that walk to each other, and as they pass each other]
LORELAI: [Sighs] Sorry.
LUKE: Oh. Don't worry about me. I'm fine.
LORELAI: Are you fine, really? Because, I mean, you don't have to be fine. Because this is really weird and really hard and... [Chuckles] I'm not exactly fine.
LUKE: You're not?
LORELAI: Of course not.
LUKE: Well, that's too bad because I am. I'm fine.
LORELAI: Well...okay.
LUKE: You know maybe you should punch Christopher's lights out. That seemed to do it for me.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Oh, so your boyfriend didn't tell you. Hu.
LORELAI: You punched Christopher?
LUKE: You two need to work on your communication k*ll.
LORELAI: Oh, stop it.
LUKE: What.
LORELAI: Christopher is not my boyfriend.
LUKE: I don't care if he is. I mean, you know you can date whoever or whatever you want. I couldn't care less. I'm fine.
LORELAI: Okay, fine. Well, if you're so fine, the next time you get a hankering to punch someone, don't, okay? If you need to take your anger out, on someone take it out on me. I'm the one you're mad at. I'm the one who deserves it.
LUKE: Look, you're the one who's still hung up here. I'm telling you, I'm over it. I guess it's just not as big a deal to me as it is to you.
LORELAI: Oh, it's not as big a deal?
LUKE: Yeah, so we're not getting married. It's okay by me. I mean you're the one who proposed in the first place.
[Lorelai has a shocked look on her face]
LUKE'S DINER
[They are painting]
LUKE: It looks good.
T.J.: If you say so. It's no Sistine chapel.
LUKE: Well, that's true.
T.J.: It's no Taj Mahal.
LUKE: No it is not the Taj Mahal. So, look, the window guy's coming by tomorrow, and he and I are gonna put it in, so... after this coat, you're free to go, okay? And thanks for the help. It really looks good.
T.J.: You sure you don't want any?
LUKE: No, I'm sure.
T.J.: You stop drinking beer?
LUKE: No.
T.J.: It makes you bloated, but to me, it's worth it. I'm psyched Kirk's got a liquor license.
LUKE: Uh-huh.
T.J.: How come you quit drinking beer?
LUKE: Whoever said I quit drinking beer?
T.J.: You know what I like? Drinking beer outside. I don't know maybe it's 'cause I grew up watching my dad drink out behind the tool shed, and it's got this romantic image for me. But that's my thing.
LUKE: Your thing is drinking beer outside?
T.J.: Beer outside is the greatest. Oh, except for at ice-skating rinks, of course.
LUKE: Of course.
T.J.: Yeah, there's something about the way the Zamboni exhaust mixes with the beer that's really just out of this world. Speaking of which, guess what I just got - tickets to the Hockettes. You know the Hockettes, the ice-skating girls? They're amazing. They do everything the Rockettes do, only they do it with ice skates on.
LUKE: Oh, that's great, T.J.
T.J.: And guess how many tickets I got. Four. And who did I think might like to go with me and Liz? President and Mrs. Bush. [Luke laughs] Just kidding. You and Lorelai.
LUKE: Oh, I, gee. I don't... think we can make that.
T.J.: Come on! When's the last time we all had a wild night out?
LUKE: Yeah, you know, I think I'm doing something that week.
T.J.: Man, that sucks.
LUKE: [grumbles] Yeah.
T.J.: Wait, which week?
LUKE: Uh, the week of the Rockettes.
T.J.: Which is which week?
LUKE: The week they're here.
T.J.: They're in town a whole month! And I'm fully willing to switch my tickets for whichever night is best for you guys.
LUKE: Yeah, I don't - I don't think so.
T.J.: Come on.
LUKE: I... Lorelai and I... broke up.
T.J.: Oh… Oh!
[He rushes in and gives Luke a big bear hug]
LUKE: Gee, T.J., Okay!
T.J.: It's okay, buddy. It's okay. Let it out. There is no shame in experiencing pain.
LUKE: I'm having trouble breathing.
T.J.: You are coming over to dinner tonight with me and Liz.



LORELAI'S HOUSE – FRONT DOOR
[Rory enters carrying shopping, she see the living room decorated in and Asia theme, Japanese rock music plays]
LORELAI: Hello, honorable Rory-san.
RORY: You've made Asia for me?
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Here's your kimono, honorable Rory-san.
RORY: Thank you. You made crazy Asia.
LORELAI: Well, actually, believe it or not, but this is an exact replica of Japan, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Korea, and any other Asian countries that might have slipped my mind. This is exactly what you would see in the other Asia.
RORY: The one that's not in our living room.
LORELAI: Yeah, the old Asia. The first attempt, I like to call it. The prototype.
RORY: Asia's a lot smaller than I thought, more intimate. And more fragrant.
LORELAI: Yes well, Miss Patty donated a bottle of her opium perfume, and I spritzed it around a little.
RORY: A little.
LORELAI: Well, little at first, and then I tripped on my flip-flop and broke the bottle.
RORY: Asia's so pretty. I love all the lanterns and the poster of Mao. Very nice. And one of Sandra Oh. Oddly, you have a poster of Sandra Oh.
LORELAI: Well, she's a goddess. And those aren't posters. They're billboards. You've lost perspective.
RORY: Ah. I see you Feng Shuied the furniture.
LORELAI: Because it was so Unfeng Shuied before. It was ridiculous. Here [hands Rory a camers] to document our journey.
RORY: Xie xie.
LORELAI: Oh, god bless you.
RORY: That's "thank you" in mandarin.
LORELAI: I knew that. Just testing you. Perhaps I shall outline our itinerary.
RORY: Perhaps we shall.
[Rory takes a photo of Lorelai]
LORELAI: Oh…All right, well, first stop is Japan, land of the rising sun, ruled by hello kitty, where we are gonna make our own sushi.
RORY: You, me, and raw fish? Is that safe?
LORELAI: Well, I took a lesson, and if you're really nervous, then we can skip the Fugu. After we're stuffed with sushi, we will take an invisible Rikshaw to the rice paddies, I.E. Your room, where we will spend hours Origamiing.
RORY: [Gasps] Paper cranes!
LORELAI: Yeah, and paper bulldozers and paper dump trucks and whatever else your little heart desires. Then, we'll take a b*llet train straight back to Tokyo where we'll relax with some tai chi in preparation for the kabuki play I wrote.
RORY: Tai chi's actually chinese.
LORELAI: Duh. I know that. We're gonna teach it to the Japanese.
RORY: That's nice of us.
LORELAI: We're very nice that way, alright so, finally, we will conclude our journey with some fortune cookies and dessert sushi.
RORY: Dessert sushi - I do love Asia.
LORELAI: Hmm, and that will be followed by an educational video, which includes, but is not limited to, "Bridge On The River Kwai,"
RORY: Aw…
LORELAI: "The Joy Luck Club," "Karate Kid," "Shanghai Surprise," The Bruce Lee classic "Enter the Dragon," the Tom Selleck classic "Mr. Baseball," and or "Breakfast at Tiffany's."
RORY: "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
LORELAI: Starring Mickey Rooney in his tour-de-force r*cist performance as Holly Golightly's Japanese landlord.
RORY: Oh, yeah, he's so bad.
LORELAI: All right, let's make some Sushi. But I'm scared. Oh, I'll let you in on a secret. The fish is really fried chicken.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
[The girls are watching a movie]
LORELAI: You are honestly asserting that you like the "Tootsie-roll marshmallow Twizzler" roll better than the "butterfinger junior mint chocolate-chip jujube" roll?
RORY: Hey call me crazy. I don't think butterfingers go with jujubes.
LORELAI: Crazy. The limitations of your palate astound me.
RORY: Hey, I liked the "Oreo red hot" sashimi.
LORELAI: Me too.
RORY: See, I'm not a hater.
LORELAI: Did you notice how the red hots acted as a dessert-Sushi Wasabi?
RORY: I did, which is something we should remember when we go to mass-market these.
LORELAI: I am telling the invention of dessert Sushi is gonna make us our first million.
RORY: And our second.
LORELAI: I'd like our third to be go-go dancing.
RORY: Sounds like a plan. Hmm, I'm not following this plot.
LORELAI: Okay, um... in the last scene, there was a sign that said, "no shirt, no shoes, no service." And this guy, shirtless guy, is angry about that - angry. And he's like, "no, I'm not gonna wear a shirt! I hate shirts!" and that pissed those other guys off. Hey, you know what would be amazing and really Asian? Fried ice cream.
RORY: Oh, cows must envy your stomach.
LORELAI: They do. I'm so full, I can't move. I feel like one of those cats that's bred to have no legs.
LORELAI: Oh don't get me wrong - my stomach's ready to explode. This is not a physical hunger. It's more of a spiritual hunger.
RORY: For fried ice cream.
LORELAI: Yeah, it's an eastern-philosophy thing. You wouldn't understand. [get up and goes to the kitchen, Rory is on the couch still.] So, how do you think one actually goes about frying ice cream?
RORY: Probably in a frying pan.
LORELAI: Uh-oh.h. Bit of a situation here.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: We are out of ice cream.
[The phone rings]
RORY: I'm a cat with no legs.
LORELAI: We can't answer it. We're out of the country. No ice cream. Unbelievable. One time I feel like cooking there's not ice cream to fry...
[Answering machine beeps]
CHRISTOPHER: [On the phone] Lor, hey, it's me. Just still trying to reach you. Arr sorry I missed your call before. I wasn't calling about that whole "Luke hitting me" thing. I don't care about that. I just want to talk to you. I want to talk to you about the other night. You said it was just a one-night thing, but I want to talk about it, and about you and me, so... call me so we can talk. Okay. Bye. [call ends]
LORELAI: So...
RORY: You slept with dad.
LORELAI: Yeah. I did.
RORY: You slept with dad. Um, that's just... I can't believe you slept with dad. Is that why you and Luke broke up, because you slept with dad?
LORELAI: No, honey. No, I... believe me, no. Um, Luke and I had broken up before.
RORY: For how long? I mean it couldn't have been long. You and Luke have only been broken up for three days.
LORELAI: Yeah, it was that night.
RORY: The night you and Luke broke up. Wow. So you just rushed right over there the minute you were free, huh?
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: Sounds like you were in quite a hurry did you put a dummy in the passenger seat so you could use the car-pool Lane?
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: What you didn't think of it? In too much of a rush I guess. I hope you buckled your seat belt. You're supposed to buckle your seat belt even if you're in a rush.
LORELAI: Hey, Rory…
RORY: no, don't "Rory" me. You don't get to "Rory" me. You slept with dad.
LORELAI: Yeah. I-I-I...I know.
RORY: Are you and dad an item now?
LORELAI: No, it was nothing. I mean, it... it had nothing to do with me and Luke. What happened between me and your dad was nothing. It was nothing.
RORY: Mom, you slept with dad.
LORELAI: For the love of god, will you stop saying that?
RORY: No I can't stop saying it because it happened. And you're trying to pretend like it didn't.
LORELAI: I'm not perfect, okay? People make mistakes. I mean, Gwyneth Paltrow dyed her hair that dark brown. It was very unflattering. If she's not perfect, how do you expect me to be?
RORY: Yeah, because what you did is equivalent to dying your hair. That's great. Things were finally good between you two and between me and dad. Did you not care that things were really good between me and dad? I mean do you not want us to be close? Did you mean to ruin that?
LORELAI: No! God, no! I love that dad's been good and that things with you and dad have been good. I...I was hurting. I was heartbroken. And...it happened. I slept with your dad. It's over now, and it was a mistake.
RORY: I can't believe you didn't tell me this. I mean, first of all, you say you don't want to talk. So I figure you're going through some hard emotional time and you need some space. That's fine but what you didn't tell me is that you slept with dad. No, instead you're going around joking about, you know, origami and marshmallow sushi, like I'm some idiot 5-year-old.
LORELAI: Rory, I was gonna tell you. I just wanted…
RORY: You know what, mom? If you're heartbroken, rent "An Affair to Remember," have a good cry, and drown your sorrows in a pint of ice cream. You get a hideously unflattering breakup haircut. You don't sleep with dad.
[Rory leaves]
LIZ AND T.J.'S HOME
T.J.: Honey, we're home.
LIZ: Hi.
T.J.: [kisses Liz and her belly] Keep your hands off me, you sex maniac.
LIZ: Oh, big brother, I'm so, so sorry.
LUKE: Aw, thanks.
LIZ: Come in, come in. Make yourself at home. Dinner's still in the oven, so we have time to have a cocktail here and talk.
T.J.: Cocktail hour. Pretty swanky stuff, huh?
LUKE: Very.
LIZ: Sit, sit.
LUKE: You should be the one that's sitting.
LIZ: I'm fine.
T.J.: She's fine, plus, it's good for her to move around. Keeps all those hormones circulating so they don't settle in one place, if you know what I mean.
LIZ: [hands Luke a drink] White Russian. [then T.J.] T.J.
T.J.: She's trying to liquor me up. I can see where this is going.
LUKE: It better not.
LIZ: We're really into White Russians recently.
T.J.: It's our thing.
LUKE: Yeah.
LIZ: Of course, mine's a virgin.
T.J.: Ironically.
LIZ: Just cream. So... I'm ready to talk.
LUKE: Oh, you know, it's really okay. I don't need to talk. It's just nice to be here.
LIZ: So was it Anna?
LUKE: What? No. It wasn't Anna.
LIZ: You sure?
LUKE: Look it wasn't Anna, okay? Lorelai and I just broke up, and I'd really rather not talk about it, so... if you don't want to talk about something else, let's sit here and drink our White Russians.
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT
[Rory comes in]
RORY: Lane? Lane?
LANE: I'm in here.
RORY: Is Zach or Brian here?
LANE: No.
RORY: Sorry I didn't call first. I don't know the protocol for married friends. I just had to get out of my house. If I were there for one more second, I think I would have had to karate-chop my mom. I swear, just chopped her in half. I guess I...[she sees Lane sitting on the floor] Lane, are you okay? Did the doctor say you have a parasite?
LANE: In a manner of speaking. [Sighs] I'm pregnant.
RORY: Shut up.
LANE: I'm pregnant.
RORY: You're not.
LANE: I am.
RORY: No.
LANE: Yes. I went to the doctor and he told me. I'm pregnant with a baby.
RORY: No.
LANE: Yes.
RORY: Wow.
LANE: Yeah, wow.
RORY: Oh, my god. Wow. Wow. How did Zach take it?
LANE: He didn't. I haven't told him yet. I haven't told anyone. I just came back here and sat here, pregnant.
RORY: You're not.
LANE: I am.
RORY: Really?
LANE: Really, I guess the combination of salt water and seaweed and discount Mexican condoms and terrible, terrible sex leads to a baby.
RORY: A baby.
LANE: A baby. Sex sucks so bad. Sex sucks worse than I thought.
RORY: You only did it one time, and - wow, a baby.
LANE: That's what you get, folks, for making whoopee.
RORY: You're going to be a mother.
LANE: When the doctor told me, I started throwing up.
RORY: Well you had morning sickness.
LANE: This was a different kind of throwing up. This was the kind of throwing up that you do when you have to do something that you can't do.
RORY: You're going to be a great mother.
LANE: Maybe someday, but not now. I have a picture in my head of me as a mother. You know, I can imagine it, and in that picture, I'm wearing a skirt and heels, and my hair is up in a bun. I'm pushing one of those fancy British baby carriages that are called silver surfers or something.
RORY: Very Madonna in her British-mommy phase.
LANE: When I'm a mom, I'll be calm and wise and have my act together. I am not calm and not wise, and I really, really don't have my act together.
RORY: You don't have to wear heels and push a pram to be a mother.
LANE: A pram! See? I didn't even remember the word pram. Mothers know the word pram.
RORY: Mothers don't have to know the word pram.
LANE: Yes, they do! They have to know all sorts of things. They have to know what to do when your baby is crying and how to change a diaper and how to use your wrist to test if the bottle is too hot. Why the wrist? I don't know. I have no idea.
RORY: Um, I think because it's handy, no pun intended, and um it's sensitive. Wrists are sensitive.
LANE: It's just one false move, one misstep, and I'll ruin it. I'm still making mistakes, Rory. Example "a" - I'm pregnant. I can't be making mistakes when I'm a mother. I'm not the person I need to be to be able to do this. I'm not perfect yet. I'm so not perfect.
RORY: You don't have to be perfect. I mean, even Gwyneth Paltrow makes mistakes, like "Shallow Hal" and that other movie that nobody saw where she played a stewardess. So who's perfect? Nobody. Not even mothers.
LANE: Yeah…I'm scared.
RORY: I know you are, but you can do this. First of all, you are great. And second of all, you have nine long months to study about bottles and wrists.
LANE: That's true.
RORY: And, already, you are way ahead of a lot of people as far as parenting k*ll go, like Britney. Britney Spears does not know which end of a baby goes up. And Courtney Love? She's no June Cleaver.
LANE: Yeah I bet I could be a better mother than Courtney Love.
RORY: My sock drawer could be a better mother. But, yes, of course you would be. And Michael Jackson - you know not to name a child "blanket."
LANE: I do know that. Do not name your baby after an inanimate object.
RORY: See? Way ahead of the pack.
LANE: Yeah. Hey... I wonder if um blanket ever met Tom and Katie's baby, Pillow.
RORY: Yeah, that would be a perfect play date.
LANE: Yeah, when it's nap time, they would be totally set.
RORY: And then they could invite Gwyneth's Apple over afterward for a little snack.
LANE: Banjo, Rachel Griffiths' baby, could play for them.
RORY: And then they could all jump in Mia Farrow's Satchel and make fun of, uh... what's his face?
LANE: Oh, Pilot Inspektor Lee.
RORY: Yeah.
[They giggle]
LIZ AND T.J.'S HOUSE
LIZ: Little more time, looks like.
T.J.: Can I set you up with another White Russian there, Luke?
LUKE: One was plenty, thank you.
LIZ: I can't believe it's not ready. I thought for sure it'd be ready by now. I'm so sorry, Luke. You must be starving.
LUKE: Don't worry about it.
LIZ: Uh maybe we should start with a little first course. Let me see what I have in here.
LUKE: So what exactly are you making that cooks for this long?
LIZ: Tuna loaf.
LUKE: Tuna loaf.
T.J.: That sounds amazing.
LUKE: Well, it's very thoughtful of you.
LIZ: Jello cups!
T.J.: Score.
LIZ: Well, anyway, invention is the mother of necessity. Eat your jello course. So it's not surprising, you know?
LUKE: What's not?
LIZ: You and Lorelai breaking up. I mean, that's not much of a surprise.
LUKE: Yeah. I don't know.
LIZ: I mean, I love Lorelai, but the two of you were...
LUKE: Were what?
LIZ: You were never in sync. I don't mean that in a bad way.
LUKE: What do you mean, we were never in sync?
LIZ: Okay, for one thing, you never really moved in together. You wanted to, but you never did. You were in two different places.
LUKE: Well, there was a logistical thing.
LIZ: And then, when you found out you had a daughter, you never told her. That's not normal, Luke. That's not how people in a healthy relationship act. It's like that space-time-continuum thing. You're on a plane over here, and she's on this plane over there, and you were both never here nor there at the same time.
T.J.: It's like string theory.
LUKE: String Theory, what do you know about string theory?
T.J.: Don't underestimate me, Luke. I read. And I watch "Battlestar Galactica."
LUKE: Look, Lorelai and I just did not work out.
LIZ: You were on different planes. It could have worked out if there was a wormhole between your plane and her plane.
LUKE: We didn't need a wormhole.
LIZ: It was like that movie with, um, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.
T.J.: Exactly!
LIZ: Yeah.
T.J.: Oh, yes! Exactly, exactly!
LIZ: You're living in the same house, man, but you are a couple years apart in the space-time continuum.
T.J.: What house? It was a bus. Oh! I thought you were talking about "Speed." "Speed" applies, too.
LUKE: Lorelai and I didn't break up because we weren't on the same place in a space-time continuum or because there weren't any wormholes. We broke up because we weren't right for each other. Okay, it wasn't space. It wasn't time. It was us, okay? We didn't belong together. [Luke sounds like he is trying to convince himself] We never really... belonged together. We wanted to, but... we never did. That's it.
[The timer for the over rings, Liz gets up to get the food]
LIZ: I am so excited. [She pulls the food out f the oven] It's cold. The oven's cold. The oven's broken.
T.J.: Oh, man, still?
LIZ: We forgot to fix the oven. Oh, Luke, I am so sorry. I really wanted to make you a home-cooked meal.
LUKE: I'll go the store and get something to make for us.
LIZ: Oh, Luke.
LUKE: That's okay, really. I don't mind. Aw, I'll get us some stuff and make us a home-cooked meal. Your burners work?
LIZ: Yeah, they work.
LUKE: Okay, good. Great.
LIZ: At least you'll have a home-cooked meal.
LUKE: Okay, I'll be back in a bit.
LIZ: Okay.
SUPERMARKET
[Luke gets some food out of the freezer and turns to see Lorelai.]
LUKE: [Sighs] Hey.
LORELAI: Well, I guess both of us avoiding Doose's didn't work out that well, huh?
LUKE: Well, I wasn't avoiding Doose's. Just the closest market to Liz and T.J.'s house.
LORELAI: Right. Because you're not affected by this. You're not mad. I forgot.
LUKE: No, I...I was mad. I was really mad.
LORELAI: Yeah, I kind of figured.
LUKE: [Sighs] I know I was a jerk. I was just...mad.
LORELAI: I was the jerk. I was such a jerk.
LUKE: I'm not mad anymore. Well... [Sighs] That's not true, but... I won't be, you know, eventually. Really.
LORELAI: Yeah?
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Okay.
LUKE: It's not your fault. It's not my fault. It's just, we're not right together, you know? You're you, I'm me. I just… want to stop pretending we're something else. You don't belong with me. You belong with someone like Christopher. and I just... let's just stop fighting it, okay? And you go back to being Lorelai Gilmore. I'll go back to being the guy in the diner who pours your coffee.
[Lorelai looks like she is about the break down, but holds on.]
LORELAI: My hand's getting cold. [holds up some ice cream]
LUKE: [nods] Okay.
LORELAI: Okay.
[Lorelai walks past Luke and away from him]
LORELAI'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

GILMORE MANSION
[Lorelai and Rory have just arrived in the jeep, it's night time.]
LORELAI: Hey, punch me in the stomach.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Real quick -- jab, jab. Not too hard. Just enough to cause internal bleeding.
RORY: That sounds pretty hard.
LORELAI: Yeah, true, plus, internal bleeding is internal, which means it can't be proven. And unless my mother sees blood, there's no way she's gonna let you take me to the hospital. You're right you're gonna have to punch me in the face. Real quick -- jab, jab.
RORY: I am not going to punch you in the fAce.
LORELAI: Why? I'll heal. I'd much rather spend the night in the emergency room getting 8 to 10 stitches than go in there for dinner. Plus, it'll give me a groovy scar. I've always wanted a groovy scar.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: It'd be such a great conversation piece. "Where did you get that groovy scar?" "Oh, my daughter dropkicked me for no apparent reason." She's totally psycho.
RORY: Oh, so now I'm dropkicking you?
LORELAI: Give me and few options you didn't like the whole jab, jab thing.
RORY: We haven't had dinner with them in three weeks. Suck it up. We're going in.
LORELAI: Hey you didn't make it through the last dinner, which means technically you've had four weeks, which means you owe me one.
RORY: I stayed for cocktail hour.
LORELAI: That's the best part.
RORY: I can't help that it's at the beginning.
LORELAI: Okay, fine, then you stay through dessert, and I'll leave early to go spend time with Logan.
RORY: Oh, I miss Logan.
LORELAI: Yeah, me too. Let's talk about him for four or five hours.
RORY: We're going inside. [goes to knock on the door]
LORELAI: No! Gonna be horrible.
RORY: They're always horrible.
LORELAI: No, it's gonna be horribler because of the whole Luke thing.
RORY: Well doesn't grandma already know because of the house debacle?
LORELAI: No she suspects, but she doesn't know know. I'm gonna have to tell them.
RORY: Well, just tell them real quick, like ripping a band-aid off.
LORELAI: Ripping a band-aid off that's been superglued, stapled, and surgically embedded in my arm.
RORY: Just tell them, and then we can move on, we can talk about more pleasant things, like the middle east.
LORELAI: I don't know how they're gonna come at me. I mean I know they're gonna come at me, but I don't know how. I mean It could be guilt, pity, anger, contempt. They have so many options.
RORY: Well in all likelihood, it will be a combination of all of those.
LORELAI: I don't want the whole night to be about Luke.
RORY: It won't be. Don't worry. Just put it out there, and then when they attack you, whatever angle they're coming from, I will deflect.
LORELAI: How will you deflect?
RORY: Well I don't know. Maybe I will talk about Bangalore.
LORELAI: You know a lot about Bangalore?
RORY: Don't you? Bangalore? Outsourcing? When you call customer service, you're talking to some nice dude in India who speaks perfect English. Don't you read time magazine?
LORELAI: It doesn't seem like a rich subject area.
RORY: Yeah. [knocks on the door]
LORELAI: No! Uhh! Ah I know you tell them you're converting to Judaism, and that will throw the friday-night-dinner thing in jeopardy.
RORY: There you go.
[the door opens and a girls or about 10 years old answers]
CHARLOTTE: Hello.
LORELAI: Hi.
RORY: Hello.
CHARLOTTE: Come in. May I take your coats?
LORELAI: Uh, well, okay. Here you go. [Chuckles] That's a pretty dress.
CHARLOTTE: Thank you.
LORELAI: Oh. You okay there?
CHARLOTTE: I'm fine. Right this way.
LORELAI: Weird.
RORY: So weird.
LORELAI: It's a child, right?
RORY: Pretty sure.
LORELAI: Maybe mom has run out of adults who will work for her. [they walk in to the living room] Hi, mom. Hi, dad.
RICHARD: Good evening, Rory. Lorelai.
RORY: Hi, grandma. Hi, grandpa.
EMILY: Well done, Charlotte. C.C. Guest couldn't have done it better herself.
CHARLOTTE: Thank you, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Lorelai, Rory, allow me to introduce charlotte Courtwright. Charlotte, this is Lorelai Gilmore and Rory Gilmore, my granddaughter and her mother.
CHARLOTTE: It's a pleasure to meet you.
LORELAI: Oh, a pleasure.
RORY: Hi again. [waves]
EMILY: Charlotte's grandparents, Arthur and Beverly, are dear friends of ours. In fact, it was the Courtwrights who put us up for membership at Blackledge. Isn't that right, Richard?
RICHARD: Indeed it is, although I have a feeling Arthur did that just so he could humiliate me on the links every Sunday. [to Charlotte] Hell of a golfer, your grandfather.
CHARLOTTE: Yes, he used to be scratch, but now he's a 3.
RORY: You know "Charlotte's web" is one of my favorite books.
LORELAI: Spiders talking to pigs. What could be better?
CHARLOTTE: Can I offer anyone a cocktail?
LORELAI: Uh...okay. Sure. Is that legal?
EMILY: She'll have a martini with a twist. Scotch on the rocks for Richard. "G" and "T" for me. Rory?
RORY: Just a club soda, please.
CHARLOTTE: Would Lorelai you like that straight up or on the rocks?
LORELAI: Um, Straight up. Thanks.
EMILY: You're never too young to learn to make a Martini.
LORELAI: Who is that?
EMILY: I told you. It's the Courtwrights' granddaughter, charlotte.
LORELAI: Why is she taking our coats and pouring us drinks? Did you win her in a poker game?
RICHARD: Your mother has been dragooned by her colleagues at the D.A.R. To lend her expertise to this year's summer cotillion.
LORELAI: It's been quite a responsibility. But Eliza Appleton insisted that there was no one she knew who was better suited to preparing these girls for society living. I could hardly say no.
CHARLOTTE: Here we are.
RICHARD: Oh. Thank you, charlotte.
CHARLOTTE: Martini straight up.
LORELAI: Oh. Thanks.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: So, nothing for you? You driving tonight?
CHARLOTTE: Oh, Lorelai, I'm only 10.
EMILY: In any case Charlotte missed last week's session on table manners, so we've decided to make tonight's dinner a makeup class.
CHARLOTTE: I'm awfully sorry about that, Mrs. Gilmore. My grandparents took me to a count basie tribute at Tanglewood.
EMILY: [changing here tone] Charlotte, you might have noticed the ice cubes in my glass have already melted. There's a whole ice bucket up there. There's no need to be so stingy.
CHARLOTTE: [sounding scared] I'm sorry.
EMILY: For future reference. It's obviously too late now.
LORELAI: This is your chance. Get out while you still can. I can show you all the good escape routes.
CHARLOTTE: [happy again] Mrs. Gilmore warned me you'd be full of smart remarks.
[Lorelai is surprised and taken back]
[Opening Credits]
GILMORE MANSION
[They are moving to the dining room]
EMILY: Now, tonight we'll be dining with service La Russe, which has nothing to do with Russians -- thank god -- because in my experience, their table manners are nothing to emulate. All it means is that the servers will be passing each course in turn instead of plopping all the food on the table at once, like some mukluk picnic. Now, it is the duty of the gentleman to help a lady to her seat. Richard.
RICHARD: It is my pleasure.
RORY: We can seat ourselves.
LORELAI: Yeah, seating us is more of a privilege, not a duty.
EMILY: Now, immediately upon sitting, one should plAce one's napkin in one's lap. And, mind you, no need for a flourish. The ability to use a napkin is nothing to brag about.
[Lorelai makes a flourish when placing her napkin]
RORY: The table looks beautiful, grandma.
EMILY: Why, thank you, Rory.
LORELAI: What's with all the forks?
EMILY: Every piece of silverware has a purpose. You simply work from the outermost utensil in towards your plate. Can you name each of these forks?
[In the background we hear Charlotte start to name the forks]
LORELAI: Each one of these forks is gonna take 20 minutes.
CHARLOTTE: And then the fish fork, and then the entrée fork, and then -- is this the dessert? Oh, wait -- it's for the roast course, isn't it?
EMILY: Exactly. Very good, charlotte.
RORY: Hey you're gonna wow them at your cotillion.
CHARLOTTE: Did you ever attend a cotillion?
RORY: No, I haven't, actually, but I had a coming-out party.
LORELAI: And I totally supported her decision. She shouldn't have to hide her love for women.
EMILY: Lorelai, there's nothing funny about being a lesbian.
RORY: I'm sure you'll have fun at your cotillion.
CHARLOTTE: I'm very much looking forward to it.
LORELAI: Oh, don't get too excited. Cotillions are not fun parties. They're boring rituals to train a whole new generation of snobs.
EMILY: And how exactly would you know? Lorelai never actually attended a cotillion.
LORELAI: You don't have to jump off the empire state building to know it's gonna hurt.
[A disappointing look from Richard]
CHARLOTTE: Um, this looks delicious, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: It's just a simple Potage Au Cresson. [continues talking to Charlotte in the back ground]
RORY: [to Lorelai] I thought you were gonna rip off the band-aid.
LORELAI: Well I, the kid threw me off. I'm looking for an opening, I'll find it.
EMILY: ...To ladle the broth away from our bodies.
RICHARD: Rory, how has the summer been treating you so far?
RORY: It's treating me very well so far, thank you.
EMILY: Are you relaxing in preparation for your senior year?
RORY: Well, I've been doing some part-time work. Paris opened this business, a tutoring business, and it prepares people for the S.A.T.S. It's kind of like the Princeton review but meaner.
RICHARD: Sounds very enterprising.
EMILY: And what about your social calendar? Do you have anything exciting planned?
RORY: Not really. Logan's in London, so...
EMILY: Logan is Rory's boyfriend. He's a Huntzberger.
CHARLOTTE: Ah.
RICHARD: How is Logan enjoying London?
RORY: I think he likes it. He's working a lot and meeting different department heads, getting situated, learning to talk British, you know.
RICHARD: Lorelai, how's summer with you? Anything new?
LORELAI: Um...we planted some pansies at the Dragonfly, in the back there. They look good. And, um, I finally bought a new DVD player. And... Luke and I broke up.
EMILY: Did you? That's too bad.
RICHARD: Hmm.
[several seconds of silence]
EMILY: Now, charlotte, when the conversation lags, a good guest ought to be prepared to introduce a new topic. Keep it light -- no politics, no religion. My little trick? Think of things in the middle three sections of the Sunday New York Times -- travel, arts & leisure, Sunday styles -- and forget the rest of the paper exists.
[Lorelai is looking confused]
LORELAI: Look, it's all right.
EMILY: What is?
LORELAI: We can talk about the breakup. I'm sure you have thoughts on the subject, and why don't we get it all out in the open now so we can move on with our lives?
EMILY: I've moved on. Richard, anything you'd like to add?
RICHARD: I can't think of a thing.
EMILY: All right, then. Isn't it interesting how they're renovating so many of the old Paradores in Spain? Funny you should mention that because last week at the club, Chick Walsh told me that he and Mary stayed at this extraordinary old castle near Madrid. Where was it? Um, uh, Lerma.
EMILY: Lerma? How nice.
LORELAI: Excuse me. Uh, what's going on? Why are we talking about Lerma? It's a town in Spain.
LORELAI: Yes, I understand geography, but why are you avoiding the subject of my breakup?
EMILY: Honestly, Lorelai, I see no point in continuing this conversation. We couldn't possibly say anything right, so why say anything at all?
LORELAI: Well that's not true.
EMILY: It absolutely is.
LORELAI: You could say something. You could try. You could say, "I'm sorry, Lorelai. This must be a very hard time for you."
EMILY: Well, i am sorry, Lorelai, I'm sure this is a very hard time for you.
LORELAI: That's it? That's all?
EMILY: I just said what you said to say.
LORELAI: I mean you don't have anything of your own to add?
EMILY: I'm sure whatever Luke did…
LORELAI: See? It's so interesting you blame it on him, and you don't even know the whole story.
RORY: Mum
EMILY: I knew we couldn't talk about this. I should have claimed I had laryngitis.
RICHARD: Lorelai, your mother is simply expressing our regrets that you've ended your relationship with Luke. I hardly see how that's offensive.
LORELAI: Fine… Only that's not true. You never liked Luke. You never showed him anything but total contempt.
RICHARD: That's not true. I played golf with Luke.
LORELAI: Once.
EMILY: We were buying the two of you a house. Doesn't the fact that we were willing to spend an enormous amount of money on a wedding present count for anything?
LORELAI: So, that's what you're mad about? Your mad about the enormous amount of money you might have wasted?
RORY: Mum.
EMILY: That's not what I was saying.
LORELAI: Well, you implied it.
EMILY : Lorelai that's…
RICHARD: Bangalore! Bangalore!… Bangalore.
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory's bedroom early morning, her cell phone rings, she turns on a light and answers it.]
RORY: Hi.
LOGAN: Morning, Ace. [to someone handing Logan some food] Thanks.
RORY: How's your day going?
LOGAN: My day hasn't started yet. How was your yesterday?
RORY: [Yawns] I'm still sleepy.
LOGAN: I can let you go back to sleep.
RORY: No, no, I'm up. I'm up. What happened yesterday?
LOGAN: My yesterday or your yesterday?
RORY: Either one.
LOGAN: Let's see, I had a scone for breakfast -- not as dry as Monday's, but I still think there's room for improvement. And then I went into a meeting with about 18 different department heads, all of whom I believe are named Nigel, and that meeting lasted for about nine hours.
RORY: Was it a cranberry scone?
LOGAN: Blueberry.
RORY: Those are my favorite kind.
LOGAN: Your turn.
RORY: Well, I'm tutoring this new kid, Benji. And, oh, it was really funny because he kept misusing this word. I don't remember what word it was. But it will come to me. Anyway, he kept misusing it, and I didn't want to correct him 'cause I didn't want him to feel embarrassed. But then he messed up on the work sheet, and then he realized all by himself that he had misused the word. [Chuckles] I guess it wasn't funny "ha ha." It was more funny "you had to be there."
LOGAN: That's okay.
RORY: Are you working?
LOGAN: Just I.M.'ing.
RORY: If you have to go…
LOGAN: No I just have to let my assistant know I'm on the phone with you, so I'll be 2 minutes late to the meeting.
RORY: I don't want you to be late.
LOGAN: It's no problem. I don't mind.
RORY: Well now I feel like I have to come up with something great to talk about.
LOGAN: No pressure. [looking at the computer screen] Ohh.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: Nothing.
RORY: Now you really do have to go.
LOGAN: Well, yeah.
RORY: "Philanthropic."
LOGAN: What?
RORY: Philanthropic, that was the word that Benji kept misusing. He kept saying "Philantropic." He thought it meant "tropical." It was funny.
LOGAN: I'll call you tonight.
RORY: My tonight or your tonight?
LOGAN: Got to go, Ace.
RORY: Okay. Bye. [Hangs up, Inhales, exhales deeply]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – KITCHEN
[Morning, Lorelai is sitting at the kitchen table "playing" with her food, Rory comes in.]
RORY: Are you enjoying your breakfast?
LORELAI: I don't know if I like pop-tarts.
RORY: Did you fall on your head while you were sleeping?
LORELAI: I don't know. Do I like this? Is this something I like?
RORY: So, you fell on your head, and now you have some kind of very specific amnesia, is that it?
LORELAI: Last night I was dreading mom and dad's reaction to the breakup, right?
RORY: Right. Dread, dread. I remember.
LORELAI: And then they didn't react -- not one bit. It's almost like the absence of their reaction was worse than any freak-out they could have had.
RORY: Okay. Sure.
LORELAI: Then I thought, "why? Why do I care if they freak out? What do I get out of it?"
RORY: Uh ha.
LORELAI: And then I thought, "maybe their freak-outs" are like some kind of compass for me, you know "like, I know I'm doing what I want to do if it freaks them out." And then I thought, "what if I don't want to do "what I want to do because I want to do it, but because they don't want me to?"
RORY: Huh?
LORELAI: I mean what if I don't like what I like because I like it, but because my mother doesn't like it and doesn't want me to like it? What if I don't actually like the music that I like or the movies or the clothes or the men? What if I don't like what I seem to like?
RORY: Ah, hence the pop-tart.
LORELAI: Yes. Hence. I can remember the first time I had a pop-tart. It was at my friend Erica Catcha's house, and she said, "do you want a pop-tart?" And I knew my mother would recoil at the very idea of me having a pop-tart. I could just picture her. [Emily voice] "A pop-tart?!" [normal voice] And so, I had one. And I opened the little silver wrapper, and I took a bite, and I thought nothing had ever tasted so good. I thought it tasted like freedom. It tasted like I was my own person. The pop-tart tasted like freedom and rebellion and independence.
RORY: Wow. That's some pop-tart. What flavor was that?
LORELAI: But now I think I don't know if I like pop-tarts. What if I don't like pop-tarts? Would I like pop-tarts if Richard and Emily had served me pop-tarts on a silver platter and demanded I eat every bite? I don't know.
RORY: Hey, where are all the pop-tarts?
LORELAI: I've been experimenting.
RORY: You ate all the pop-tarts?
LORELAI: If it makes you feel any better I don't know if I like them!
RORY: Well, I hope you didn't eat all the Froot Loops.
LORELAI: Hey, how was last night's conversation?
RORY: Eh.
LORELAI: Eh-eh?
RORY: It's just these transatlantic phone calls. I don't know if it's the "trans" or the "Atlantic" or the fact that it's 2:00 in the morning, but Helen Keller and Stephen Hawking could have a more connected conversation.
LORELAI: Helen Keller's dead.
RORY: Yeah, well, even dead, she could do better. It's just so awkward and pausy. And I feel like the more I try to connect, the more disconnected I feel. And I just feel like I'm working so hard, but maybe I shouldn't be having to work so hard. And then I feel self-conscious, but I shouldn't feel self-conscious, so then I feel self-conscious about that. I don't know maybe it's just the salt in the ocean. It corrodes conversations or something.
LORELAI: Yeah. It sounds like the salt.
RORY: [Picks up a pop-tart off Lorelai plate] Um.
LORELAI: Hey!
RORY: I like pop-tarts.
LUKE'S DINER - EXTERIOR
[Sign on window "Luke's Grand Re-opening", Moving inside Luke brings Babette and Miss Patty their orders]
LUKE: Here you go, ladies.
MISS PATTY: It's the ceilings. They're vaulted now, aren't they?
LUKE: The ceilings aren't vaulted.
BABETTE: I got it, it's the curly fries. You never used to have curly
fries here before, did you Luke.
LUKE: Always had curly fries.
BABETTE: I'm telling you, something's different about the plAce.
LUKE: Nothing, nothing has changed. It's exactly the same.
MISS PATTY: He must have done something to the windows 'cause the light is much better now.
BABETTE: Yeah it's a lot less gloomy than it used to be.
LUKE: An identical level of gloom, people.
BABETTE: I got it. You got new chairs. I knew my butt felt more comfortable.
LUKE: Your butt feels exactly the same, Babette. Now, would you two can it? I didn't change a damn thing.
[Rory enters and comes to the counter]
LUKE: Hey, Rory.
RORY: Hi, Luke.
LUKE: How's it going?
RORY: Good. I'm good. And you?
LUKE: Doing good.
RORY: Glad to hear that. Congratulations on the reopening.
LUKE: Oh, yeah, thanks. Back to normal, I guess.
RORY: New hat?
LUKE: Yeah. So, I didn't think you were gonna make it back this summer.
RORY: Oh, I wasn't, but then I did.
LUKE: Things change.
RORY: Yeah.
LUKE: So, you want a table?
RORY: No, I think I'll just take some coffee and a muffin to go, if you have it.
LUKE: I have it.
BABETTE: It's the curtains!
LUKE: Yeah those curtains have always been here.
BABETTE: I know. I'm just saying you used to have more curtains.
LUKE: No, I never had more curtains.
LANE: Hi.
RORY: Lane, hey come over here.
LANE: [handing some food to a customer] Here you go.
[They sit at a table]
RORY: Hey. So? How did it go? Was it hard? Did he freak out?
LANE: What are you talking about?
RORY: Zach...and the pregnancy.
LANE: Oh. That. I haven't told him yet.
RORY: Really?
LANE: Yeah, I was, but now I'm thinking I'm gonna wait.
RORY: Okay. For how long?
LANE: I don't know. A couple years?
RORY: Lane!
LANE: I'm gonna tell him eventually, just not yet. Besides, a lot of people wait a full 12 weeks before they tell anyone they're pregnant.
RORY: Not the husband.
LANE: I just need a little more time to adjust, you know? I kind of want to process this by myself a little longer.
RORY: You can wait as long as you want. You can wait until the baby comes out and have her tell him.
LANE: Her?
RORY: Or him.
LANE: It could be a him! Oh, god, I'm not ready for a him!
RORY: Maybe it'll be a her.
LANE: Who's ready for a her?!
RORY: You are. And Zach is. You guys can do this.
LANE: Hey, you want to tell him?
LUKE: One coffee. One muffin. One employee sitting at a table.
LANE: Sorry, Luke. [Gets up]
RORY: Thanks, Luke. See you later. [leaves]
LUKE: See you later.
BABETTE: [Yelling at Luke] New mugs!
LUKE: Hey! Same mugs. [Sighs]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Lorelai enters]
SOOKIE: Wow. Somebody's all fancy-pants. I've never seen your hair up like that.
LORELAI: I'm just trying out a new look, seeing if I like it, serving no master but myself.
SOOKIE: Are you gonna try pigtails, too? Because that's kind of my thing.
LORELAI: It's freeing, really. I never realized how my mother influenced my every decision, even decisions that don't seem like decisions, like tying my shoes. I mean I've always been a fan of the bunny ears, you know? And this morning I decided not to bunny-ear, and you know what happened?
SOOKIE: No.
LORELAI: Turns out Bunny ears take a lot longer than the regular way. I saved three seconds this morning.
SOOKIE: What does your mother have to do with bunny ears?
LORELAI: My mother is everywhere…[Michel enters] in my shoes, in my clothes, in my food.
MICHEL: Your mother is here.
LORELAI: In my inn. What do you mean, what are you talking about? Why is my mother here?
SOOKIE: She's here to taste the menu for the tea. [Turns to Michel] Why doesn't she know what I'm talking about?
LORELAI: What tea?
SOOKIE: I thought you were going to tell her.
LORELAI: What tea?
MICHEL: I was going to tell her. Then I considered what it would be like if I did not tell her, and I thought it might be more fun. I was right.
LORELAI: What tea?
EMILY: Lorelai, do you normally keep your guests waiting like that? It's very rude. Hello, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Hi, Mrs. Gilmore. Welcome.
LORELAI: What tea?
EMILY: There's no need to shout, Lorelai. I'm bringing the girls here Friday for afternoon tea as part of their etiquette training.
LORELAI: Here, why bringing them here?
EMILY: Actually I was going to take them into the city for high tea at the Pierre. But the Matre d' at the Pierre apparently believes that proper high tea includes club sandwiches and a juice bar, and I simply couldn't subject these impressionable young girls to such tasteless effrontery.
LORELAI: Do they even have tea at a cotillion?
EMILY: Don't be absurd. As long as I have them under my wing, I feel that it is my duty to offer them as much of my expertise as possible. Last week we went to the symphony and the hopper exhibit at the met. This week it's high tea and "Rigoletto" at Lincoln center.
LORELAI: Have you done that thing where they walk around with books on their heads? That's always a good one.
EMILY: Sookie, these are simply divine.
SOOKIE: It's the lemon zest. It makes all the difference.
EMILY: Although, we definitely shouldn't serve the spinach quiche. Some of the girls have brAces, and their mothers would never forgive me if they spent the evening with hideous green smiles. Perhaps a Shrimp salad a or more traditional cream cheese and cucumber would be more appropriate?
LORELAI: Yum. Cucumber.
EMILY: Is that peanut butter and jelly?
SOOKIE: Yes. I just thought since the girls were only 10 that they'd enjoy it more than the smoked-salmon sandwiches.
EMILY: [snapping] They're 10. They're not animals. This is a proper tea, Sookie. I'm not interested in circus food.
LORELAI: [to Sookie] Stings, don't it?
EMILY: [to Michel] I'd like to see the room we'll be using. If the lighting isn't right, we may have to make some adjustments.
MICHEL: Right this way.
EMILY: I like your hair like that, Lorelai.
YALE NEWS ROOM
[Paris' S.A.T.s class is studying]
TUTOR: It's a good sentence, but you want to make sure never to end with a preposition.
PARIS: If she ended the sentence with a preposition, how could it have been a good sentence? Sounds like a terrible sentence.
TUTOR: Well I was…
PARIS: You were just coddling her. You want to prop her up on your knee and burp her, maybe buy her a pony? I'm not paying you to make her feel better about her incompetence. If she can't construct a proper sentence, how is she gonna pass the essay section of the S.A.T.?
TUTOR: Well…
PARIS: That was rhetorical! Carry on.
[moves on to another tutor]
PARIS: Why don't you go slower, Dalton? 'Cause you haven't been on the same page for the last 20 minutes or anything.
[Moves on to Rory and a student.]
RORY: Okay, "doctor is to hospital as, "'a,' sports fan is to stadium, 'b,' ice is to freezer, 'c' professor is to college, or, 'd,' criminal is to jail?"
ERIC: Um, "a," sports fan is to stadium?
RORY: It's actually "c," professor is to college. When you're doing this kind of analogy, you have to be a little more specific than just filling in the blank with "is found in." A doctor works in a hospital, just as a professor works in a college. Make sense?
ERIC: [smiling at Rory] You're really smart.
RORY: Thanks that's very sweet, Eric. And you're just as smart. I promise.
PARIS: Are you kidding? [buzzer goes off] That's it! Pencils down. [to Eric] That means you, Casanova. Time is up! Everyone out, unless your parents want to start paying for overtime, which for many of you might be a good idea. Not so fast, employees. Today's work was shoddy at best. Between the overt coddling and the inappropriate flirting, I feel like I'm running a bordello. Gilmore, do you see any of my students falling in love with me? No, and do you know why? because you don't fall in love with people that make you want to crap your pants. I want to see terror in their eyes! Fear is a great motivator, people. Use it. What are you standing around here for? Go! Dismissed. [to Rory] Okay, I'm not your boss anymore. We can do five minutes of friend time.
RORY: I appreciate the offer, but I have to make a phone call.
PARIS: Logan?
RORY: Yep.
PARIS: How's that going?
RORY: It's good, you know? It's fine.
PARIS: So, it's awful?
RORY: No.
PARIS: Because you downgraded from good to fine in under two seconds, so I figured I'd cut to the chase.
RORY: Not awful. It's just hard because of the distance.
PARIS: Uh-huh. How's the sex?
RORY: Um, well, seeing as he's in London and I'm here, the sex is pretty much nonexistent.
PARIS: You've got a phone. Use it.
RORY: What? You mean... [Chuckles] I can't do that. I talk to my mother on that phone.
PARIS: Okay, what about texting?
RORY: No. No, thank you.
PARIS: Why not? You say stuff when you're together, don't you?
RORY: Yeah. I guess. Sometimes.
PARIS: So, text it. Texting is great. And you can do it while you're doing other things. Doyle and I are doing it right now.
RORY: What? [Looks at Paris' phone] Oh, my god!
PARIS: Don't worry. This is advanced. Right now all you are looking to do is create some intimacy. Stick to the basics.
RORY: I don't have any basics.
PARIS: Write what you know.
RORY: Thanks, Paris. I'll figure something out.
PARIS: Doyle thinks it's a great idea.
RORY: Can you not talk about me on that thing when you're doing that with him?
PARIS: Sorry.
RORY: Jeez.



LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT – MAIN ROOM
[Zach is playing the guitar]
ZACH: I'm telling you, man, she's totally avoiding me. She won't even talk to me. She'll barely even look at me. It's over. She's divorcing me.
BRIAN: I'll admit it's not the best marriage I've seen, although I only have my parents to compare it to, and they're unusually happy.
ZACH: We were happy once, and then that stupid honeymoon happened. And ever since we came home, it's like she's a different person.
BRIAN: Maybe it was the parasite.
ZACH: What do you mean?
BRIAN: You know maybe the parasite like got into her brain and ate away the part that was in love with you.
ZACH: I can't believe it's over. I mean we haven't even written our thank-you notes.
BRIAN: I was gonna say.
ZACH: Hey man I already told you we like the bowl.
BRIAN: Doesn't mean I don't deserve a note. [Zach starts playing again] It's all gonna be okay, Zach. I'm here for you, man. I got your back. Hey, that's nice.
ZACH: Yeah, the pain is totally helping my music.
[Lane comes home]
LANE: We need to talk.
ZACH: Okay. Let's talk.
LANE: Alone?
ZACH: Anything you have to say to me, you can say in front of Brian.
LANE: I'm pregnant.
[Brian gets up and leaves]
ZACH: [stunned] With a baby?
LANE: Yes, pregnant with a baby.
ZACH: But how? When?
LANE: On a beach in Mexico, about three weeks ago. I'm pretty sure you were there.
ZACH: But we only did it once.
LANE: Once is really all it takes. [Zack leaves] Where are you going?
ZACH: Brian must be freaking out!
DRAGONFLY INN – ENTRY AND RECEPTION AREA
[Emily enters with the cotillion girls in tow, Lorelai is working on the computer]
EMILY: Good afternoon, Lorelai.
MICHEL: Oh, my goodness.
EMILY: Is the library ready for us?
LORELAI: Yes, the tables are set, and the tea is brewed, and I've hired some extra poor people for the girls to look down on.
[The girls giggle]
CHARLOTTE: She's the one I told you about -- a regular Imogene Coca.
MICHEL: Oh, my god, I love them. They are like Madame Alexander dolls come to life.
EMILY: All right, ladies, chins up, tummies in, and glide.
[Light laughter, one of the girls (Caroline) does the "chicken walk" but stops when Emily sees, Lorelai is amused.]
DRAGONFLY INN – LIBRARY
[Lorelai and Michel watch from the next room]
EMILY: Now, remember, ladies, the dress you'll be wearing at the cotillion on Saturday will have much fuller skirts. Several of you may be working with a crinoline, so sitting will be an entirely different experience. What is the rule of thumb we can always apply? Tiffany?
TIFFANY: Bottoms out.
EMILY: That's right. Bottoms, sit. Very good.
MICHEL: Such elegance, such a sense of decorum, manners, grAce, charm -- everything my childhood could have been but wasn't. Oh, to go back and do it right.
EMILY: Caroline, we do not grab or grope our dinner partners.
CAROLINE: Sorry, Mrs. Gilmore.
EMILY: Always maintain proper spacing and distance.
LORELAI: [to Michel] Err, it's all coming back to me. Proper spacing and distance. Other kids were hugged and kissed. I was taught to maintain proper spacing and distance.
EMILY: ...In which case, the utensil rule still applies. No utensil, once used, may ever touch the table again. Imagine leaving a ring of raspberry preserves on a set of fine linens. Granted, these linens aren't the best. But at the cotillion on Saturday, everything will be of the highest quality. All right, ladies, choose your first sandwich.
MICHEL: Take me.
LORELAI: Oh, Michel!
MICHEL: Take me to the cotillion.
LORELAI: Oh.
MICHEL: I have to be there. I want to go back and do it right.
LORELAI: No, forget it.
MICHEL: I insist. You must take me. You have no choice.
LORELAI: I have no choice? Do you know me? I'm not going to my mother's cotillion.
MICHEL: You owe me.
LORELAI: What? I do not.
MICHEL: Oh, yes, you do. Last November, when you were going out of town and nervous about boarding Paul Anka for the first time, you forced me, against my better judgment, to have Paul Anka over to my home for the day so he could acclimate to other dogs. Well, not only did he traumatize my poor chows, but somehow he managed to get into my closet, the door of which was firmly closed...
LORELAI: I know. I don't know how he does that.
MICHEL: ...And proceeded to poop in my Prada loafers.
LORELAI: Well, he knows good quality.
MICHEL: When I returned your foul creature and told you about what happened, you apologized profusely and then wrote an I.O.U. On several little post-its, thinking it was all so clever.
LORELAI: Gosh, I don't remember that.
MICHEL: I thought as much. [he leaves]
EMILY: ...On the seat of your chair. Do not leave it carelessly strewn about the table. Caroline? Caroline! [she has stuffed food into her mouth, the othe girls laugh]
MICHEL: [returns to Lorelai and sticks post-it's on her] "I"... "o"... "u"... "one"... "big"... "favor."
LORELAI: Can't prove I wrote that.
MICHEL: [Chuckles and puts one last post-it in her hand] "Lorelai Gilmore."
LORELAI: Ohh! I'll buy you a car.
MICHEL: No.
LORELAI: A house.
MICHEL: Pick me up at 7:00.
LORELAI: Michel!
MICHEL: And wear your hair like you had it the other day.
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT – MAIN ROOM
[Zach is watching TV]
ZACH: Good nap, babe?
LANE: Yeah, I was really out of it. I'm so tired all the time. It's weird.
ZACH: Huh, must be the heat.
LANE: Yeah, right, I guess that could have something to do with it.
ZACH: Beer?
LANE: No, I don't think I'll be drinking beer for a while.
ZACH: Oh, that's cool. Going a little straightedge.
LANE: But we probably should be drinking more calcium, so maybe I should keep an extra gallon of milk around the house.
ZACH: No problemo.
LANE: And I may start having cravings soon…
ZACH: Oh man you know what I'm craving right now? Pizza bagels. Those are definitely going on the grocery list want some of those?
LANE: Sure.
ZACH: Do you like that, mountain ninja? Do you like the taste of my broadsword?
LANE: Well, I'm off to see Rory.
ZACH: Have fun.
ANDREWS BOOKS STORE
[Both girls are sitting on the floor, Rory is reading "Henry Miller Sexus", Lane and book on pregnancy]
RORY: Yikes.
LANE: Oh, no.
RORY: Whoa!
LANE: That's disgusting.
RORY: Wow.
LANE: No way! No way!
RORY: I can't write this stuff to Logan. I can barely read it to myself. I'm bright red.
LANE: Did you notice no one ever gives details when they tell you about childbirth? It's because the details are gross and scary and unacceptable.
RORY: Like what?
LANE: Well, apparently in about three months, I can look forward to dark spots on my fAce because it's not enough to just get fat.
RORY: It's not fat. It's a baby.
LANE: A baby that will sh**t out of my body despite the fact that it's obviously much too large. I didn't think this through when we were dating. I was all into the fact that Zach was big and manly, which means I'm gonna have a big, manly baby, and I'm a small woman.
RORY: I never thought of Zach as big and manly.
LANE: Compared to Henry Lee, remember when my mom wanted me to date Henry Lee? He was like yea high. I would have had tiny, little, yea-high babies.
RORY: Yeah, but he was your second cousin. I think you would have had other problems with those babies.
LANE: What every, I'm not doing it, this baby is just gonna have to find another way out or stay in there forever. I really don't care.
RORY: Don't worry about that part, just keep taking things one step at a time. You're doing great.
LANE: How? How am I doing great?
RORY: You told Zach. That was a very significant step.
LANE: Yeah I told him, but I'm pretty sure he forgot.
RORY: What do you mean he forgot? I don't know how things get lost in the recesses of Zach's brain, but I think he forgot.
RORY: Well maybe he's just taking time to process this. You needed some time.
LANE: I am growing a human being inside my body. I deserve time. [she lies down on the floor] Ugh!
RORY: Okay well, what about this? [reading from her book] "Where is the chair you sit in? "Where is your favorite comb, toothbrush, nail file? Trot them out, that I may devour them at one gulp."
LANE: You want to eat his toothbrush?
RORY: No, I'm trying to convey that I miss him very much.
LANE: Sounds like you just miss his toiletry kit.
RORY: Well it's supposed to be metaphorical and evocative. It's Henry Miller.
LANE: Henry miller has better stuff than that. Believe me that is not why they banned his books.
RORY: Well, I'm not gonna write, "our hands groped frantically for the burning flesh."
LANE: Oh, that's better. That's way hotter than the eating-his-comb thing.
RORY: Really?
LANE: Why not go for it why are you making such a big deal out of this?
RORY: I'm just worried, you know? I mean we talk to each other on the phone every day, but I just don't think that that's enough to keep this relationship going. I guess I never realized how important the other stuff was.
LANE: The sex stuff?
RORY: And the holding-hands and the falling-asleep- next-to-each-other stuff. I mean that's where the intimacy comes from, and without those options, when they're just taken away from you 'cause someone moves to London...[Sighs] Desperate measures. [starts texting Logan]
LANE: Burn that flesh, sister.
RORY: Okay. Here it goes. I think I'm gonna puke.
LANE: Join me. That's all I'll be doing for the next two months. Oh, and did I mention the extra hair that may start to grow on my chin? Can't wait for that magic. [Rory's phone rings] Ooh, wow, quick response. I think you did good.
RORY: It's not him. Hi, dad.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, kiddo. What are you up to?
RORY: Um, just reading. Reading the books. What are you doing?
CHRISTOPHER: Just drinking the coffee, thinking I haven't seen you in a while.
RORY: I know. I miss you.
CHRISTOPHER: Me too. So, maybe we could have dinner tomorrow night, if you're free.
RORY: Tomorrow night?
CHRISTOPHER: Only if you're free.
RORY: I'm free. Yeah, that sounds like fun.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?
RORY: Sure.
CHRISTOPHER: Great. That's great. I'll pick you up about 7:00.
RORY: Cool. I'll see you tomorrow.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye, Rory.
LANE: Maybe I'll look good with a beard.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LORELAI'S BED ROOM
RORY: [Gasps] Whoa! Can I keep this?
LORELAI: First help me find something to wear tonight. Then you can steal whatever you want, except that -- I'm getting buried in that.
RORY: I don't understand why you're going to this cotillion. Does Michel have compromising photographs of you, that I don't know about, like some snapshots from your perm year?
LORELAI: No, but he does have post-its. Word to the wise, don't ever put anything in writing, 'cause even when it's on florescent sticky paper, it's still binding.
RORY: You are so wise and awesome and generous.
LORELAI: Yeah, you can steal anything you want if you go to the cotillion for me.
RORY: Can't.
LORELAI: Why? You don't have any work. You don't have a boyfriend to play with. You barely have anyone to hang out with at all.
RORY: Keep going you're really making me want to do you a favor here. I can't tonight because I have plans with dad.
LORELAI: Your dad?
RORY: Well I'm not in the habit of calling other people's dads "dad." Yeah, my dad. He called and asked me if I wanted to have dinner with him. Is that a problem?
LORELAI: No, of course not. I just didn't realize you were talking.
RORY: I haven't talked to him at all, which is why I was happy he called, because we were talking all the time before.
LORELAI: Yeah I know.
RORY: I mean, just because you guys aren't talking, it doesn't mean I'm not allowed to talk to him.
LORELAI: We are not not talking. We're just not talking right now.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Listen I think it's great that you're having dinner with your dad.
RORY: Good.
LORELAI: Good [talking about Rory's phone] What is with that thing?
RORY: I sent Logan a text message yesterday, and he still hasn't written me back. Plus, we missed our last two phone calls 'cause he keeps getting dragged into these boring meetings.
LORELAI: If he hasn't sent you anything back, it's probably he just hasn't had time yet.
RORY: Yeah, that's probably it.
LORELAI: Can I wear this to the cotillion? [wearing a very short dress over her other clothes]
RORY: [shaking her head] Mnh-mnh.
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT – MAIN ROOM
[dinner time]
ZACH: Something wrong with your dinner, babe? If your bagel's a little frozen, I can microwave that bad boy for you.
LANE: It's not that. I'm just feeling a little queasy.
ZACH: Yeah, I've been feeling queasy, too. I'm telling you, it's got to be the heat. Do you want to go to a movie or something? Cool down with some free A.C.?
LANE: I have a better idea. Why don't we talk?
ZACH: Sure. What do you want to talk about?
LANE: The baby.
ZACH: I'm cool with the whole baby thing.
LANE: You are?
ZACH: Yeah.
LANE: So, you're not worried at all?
ZACH: Nope, no worries on this end.
LANE: I see.
ZACH: I think Brian might be freaking out a little bit, but that's his problem.
LANE: Really? I didn't know Brian was concerned.
ZACH: Well, sure. I mean, he was just getting used to the idea of us getting married, and I don't think he was expecting a baby yet. But it's a lot for the guy to take in.
LANE: Absolutely. You know maybe I should talk to Brian about this because it sounds like he and I are on the same page.
ZACH: What do you mean?
LANE: Well, I'm glad you're fine, with the whole baby thing but I'm kind of freaking out.
ZACH: You are?
LANE: Totally. Zach this is not how I expected our life to go -- be married for like a day and then suddenly having to take on this new responsibility. Bringing a child into this world, it's so...
ZACH: It's major, right?
LANE: It's very major.
ZACH: So, you're not all psyched about being knocked up?
LANE: Are you kidding? This baby sucks!
ZACH: Yeah! This baby totally sucks!
LANE: It does.
ZACH: It so does.
LANE: Do you know what afterbirth is?
ZACH: No. [Lane shows him a picture] Dude.
LANE: I know.
ZACH: You know how the baby is connected to you by that hose and I'm supposed to cut that hose? No way I'm cutting that hose.
LANE: No way I'm letting you in the room when that thing comes out of me.
ZACH: Oh, man, you are so awesome. I love you so much.
LANE: I love you, too.
[They hug and kiss]
THE COTILLION
[Michel and Lorelai walking down a hall towards the cotillion room.]
MICHEL: It's like you don't even care.
LORELAI: I care about you, just not this.
MICHEL: After all the trouble I went through picking out the perfect flower for you.
LORELAI: It's kinda big don't you think, it's like wearing a tree on my arm.
MICHEL: It is an orchid.
LORELAI: It's scratchy.
MICHEL: Could have got me something, a simple boutonniere. But no. I'm so humiliated.
LORELAI: Hey I have an idea, why don't we go back to the flower store, and I'll get you something? It will take two seconds.
MICHEL: Forget it. We're late enough as it is. [Michel gasps as he sees the room] Yes, I can die now.
LORELAI: Me too. Look at that girl. Poor thing. [looking at Caroline]
MICHEL: Oh, why did someone force her to wear those exercise shoes?
LORELAI: She'd probably rather be home, in jeans, climbing a tree.
MICHEL: She looks perfectly happy to me. You know what I see when I look at this room?
LORELAI: A bunch of kids whose outfits cost more than my car?
MICHEL: No, these are not kids. They are perfect, tiny adults. We are standing amongst the next generation of movers and shakers. The future president of the united states may be in this room with us tonight.
LORELAI: You're very odd.
EMILY: Lorelai, you're here.
LORELAI: I am.
MICHEL: Hello, Emily. Oh, Emily, may I just say that what you have created here tonight is nothing short of perfection? This, this is a kind of nirvana on earth.
EMILY: Thank you, Michel. It's very kind of you to say. I'm sorry. What on earth are those musicians playing?
MICHEL: It sounds lovely.
EMILY: Are those violinists on speed? Excuse me.
LORELAI: Hey, I'm gonna get some punch. You want some?
MICHEL: Oh, no, thank you very much. I'm much too excited for punch. My throat closes off when I'm excited, so swallowing punch would be very difficult right now.
LORELAI: [Laughs] Okay.
CHARLOTTE: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Oh, Charlotte, hi.
CHARLOTTE: I'm having the most wonderful time.
LORELAI: Ah.
CHARLOTTE: Grandmother, grandfather, it's my pleasure to introduce you to Lorelai Gilmore. Lorelai, these are my grandparents -- Beverly and Arthur Courtwright.
ARTHUR: Ah, the famous Lorelai.
LORELAI: Famous? I have to catch up on my us weeklies.
ARTHUR: Charlotte told us you were a card.
BEVERLY: She also told us that you were a delightful dining companion, like Noel Coward and Slim Keith rolled into one.
LORELAI: Oh, well, she's delightful, too, like Shirley Temple and mother Teresa and someone with very good table manners rolled into one.
CHARLOTTE: It's starting. The dancing is starting.
ARTHUR: We should get the camera.
BEVERLY: Will you excuse us?
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHARLOTTE: Lorelai, did I tell you? Margot, Caroline, and I are doing a hip-hop dance, and it's gonna be so funny. We rehearsed it in the bathroom. The whole thing ends up with us somersaulting towards the band.
LORELAI: Wow! That's really great.
CHARLOTTE: Are you gonna come dance?
LORELAI: Oh, no. It's just for the kids.
CHARLOTTE: Oh, come on. Everybody is dancing.
TOBY: Pardon me. Would you like to dance, Charlotte?
CHARLOTTE: I would be delighted, Toby.
[Lorelai watches Caroline and a boy dance, they wave at each other]
MICHEL: People seem to be enjoying themselves.
LORELAI: Yeah. They really do, don't they?
MICHEL: Want to dance?
LORELAI: Me? No. Are you serious?
MICHEL: I never joke about dancing.
LORELAI: No, I'll pass.
MICHEL: You cannot pass. This is still my night, and I'd like to dance with you. Besides, charlotte insisted that I get you out on the dance floor, so that it's two against one -- you lose. Now, let's go.
LORELAI: Oh! Well... we're really [they start dancing and Lorelai looks like she is having a good time] uh-oh, uh-oh. Oh! Whoa!
EMILY: I see you're having a terrible time.
LORELAI: The worst.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
CHRISTOPHER: So, do you want the rest of this key lime pie or should I take it with me?
RORY: I don't know how you ordered key lime pie when there was chocolate brownie on the menu.
CHRISTOPHER: Because you'd already ordered a chocolate brownie.
RORY: But just the one.
CHRISTOPHER: Maybe we should give it to Paul Anka. After all, the doggie bag was invented with him in mind. Seems only fair he should benefit.
RORY: There is not way he's gonna eat that. [They laugh] I told you.
[Lorelai comes in]
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: Hi, mom.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, we were just splitting up the food. I'm...on my way out.
LORELAI: Oh. Take your time. Is that key lime pie on the floor?
CHRISTOPHER: Is that a corsage on your arm?
LORELAI: Oh, this? Yeah. Subtle, isn't it?
CHRISTOPHER: If by "subtle," you mean "weird and giant," then, yeah, super subtle.
LORELAI: Ha.
RORY: Okay, I think I'm gonna take Paul Anka for his walk. Ah, thanks for dinner, dad.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, thanks, kiddo.
RORY: Come on. Go on.
[Chris picks up the key lime pie off the floor]
LORELAI: Oh thanks.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles]
LORELAI: Did you guys have fun?
CHRISTOPHER: It was good, really good. First time I ever saw her order a drink.
LORELAI: Strange, right?
CHRISTOPHER: Very strange… Anyway, I should be going.
LORELAI: I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
CHRISTOPHER: It's okay.
LORELAI: I was going to. I just...
CHRISTOPHER: I understand. Don't worry about it.
LORELAI: Do you want some coffee or anything?
CHRISTOPHER: Sure.
LORELAI: Okay. [starts getting the coffee]
CHRISTOPHER: Actually, you know what? I can't.
LORELAI: Oh. Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: I can't just sit here and have coffee with you.
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: I love you. I know the other night didn't mean for you what it did for me, but I don't regret it and I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened -- not just because it was great, which it was... but because it was right. It was so right, lore, and you may not see that right now, but I do. And if I have to wait until we're both 80 years old for you to see it, then I'll wait. I'm not going anywhere. This is it for me. You're it for me, and I can't pretend to feel any less than I do. I'm sorry. I-I -- I just can't.
[Chris leaves]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S ROOM
RORY: [Sighs, then dials the phone]
LOGAN: Ace.
RORY: Hey, how's it going?
LOGAN: It's 4:45 in the morning. Are you okay? Did something happen?
RORY: Not really. Um, I just -- I sent you a text the other day.
LOGAN: [Chuckles] Yeah, I know. I texted you back.
RORY: No, you didn't.
LOGAN: Yes, I did. Check your phone.
RORY: I don't have any missed calls. Oh, wait, there's a little envelope thingy in the bottom corner.
LOGAN: Get out of town.
RORY: It went directly to my saved messages. Why would it do that?
LOGAN: I couldn't tell you.
RORY: [reading the message] Ooh, wow. Whoa, yours is really good. Okay, well, sorry to wake you. I'll talk to you in a few hours.
LOGAN: Whoa, wait a minute where do you think you're going?
RORY: Um, to sleep?
LOGAN: No, I don't think so. You woke me up. I'm up. Text me back.
RORY: You want me to text you back now?
LOGAN: You started this.
RORY: I know, but I don't have my books with me.
LOGAN: You don't need your books, Ace.
RORY: Logan…
LOGAN: I miss you, Rory.
RORY: You do?
LOGAN: Yeah.
RORY: I miss you, too. I can't text you with you on the phone.
LOGAN: Okay, so hang up.
RORY: I'm gonna hang up now.
LOGAN: Okay.
RORY: Okay. Bye.
LOGAN: Bye.
[they hang up and Rory starts texting]]

LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
[Night time – Chris and Lorelai get out of the Volvo]
LORELAI: [Car door closes] Let me bottom-line it for you. Snakes are gross. Snakes are scary and slithery, and do you know where snakes do not belong?
CHRISTOPHER: On a plane?
LORELAI: They do not belong on a plane.
CHRISTOPHER: It's not an ideal situation.
LORELAI: They do not belong anywhere except in cages stuck in safes buried deep, deep underground. I hate snakes!
CHRISTOPHER: So I'm gathering. With their gross, no-legged bodies, and their scaly, scaly skin, and their wiggling, and their hissing.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay Lor I respect your very valid feelings about snakes.
LORELAI: Thank you.
CHRISTOPHER: But I have to say we were fairly warned.
LORELAI: No! No! A movie should not just be its title. "Driving Miss Daisy" didn't all take place in the car, "Dances With Wolves" wasn't one long wolf dance. But this was nothing but snakes, snakes, relentless snakes, snakes on a plane. Snakes, snakes, snakes on a plane!
CHRISTOPHER: This was our fifth bad movie in a row. It's got to be some kind of a record.
LORELAI: We got to face facts - movies have gotten bad.
CHRISTOPHER: Unless it's our fault.
LORELAI: What? No, we didn't make the bad movies.
CHRISTOPHER: No, we made the movies bad. Think about it we are the common factor.
LORELAI: Ohh.
CHRISTOPHER: All the movies -- very different. Different genres -- different languages, even. We saw them in different theaters at different times. What do they all have in common?
LORELAI: They were all seen by us. Wow!
CHRISTOPHER: Huh?
LORELAI: We can never see "Casablanca" together. I mean I'm very sorry. I don't care how much I love it, but I will not be responsible for ruining "Casablanca."
[Both chuckling]
CHRISTOPHER: So...
LORELAI: So... we should divvy up the candy.
CHRISTOPHER: Divvy...
LORELAI: The candy.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
LORELAI: [Inhales, exhales sharply] Got half the milk duds. Sour patch kids -- hmm, a third. Twizzlers -- you got about 5 -- 4 3/4 -- you pick.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'll take the Twizzlers.
LORELAI: No, I meant besides the Twizzlers.
CHRISTOPHER: I tell you what -- you can have it all.
LORELAI: Such a gentleman.
[They Kiss]
LORELAI: We should...
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I should, uh...
LORELAI: I should...
CHRISTOPHER: Okay.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: Good night, Lor.
LORELAI: Good night, Chris.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – INTERIOR
[Lorelai comes inside]
LORELAI: Hi.
RORY: Well, well, someone is cutting it pretty close to curfew. Did you guys have a good time?
LORELAI: Yeah, really good. Ooh, is it weird that he didn't come in?
RORY: Weird for me?
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: Oh, I saw the guy two days ago. I'm sick of him. [giggles] Is it weird for you?
LORELAI: No. No.
RORY: He could come in if you wanted him to. I could make myself scarce.
LORELAI: Oh, you wouldn't have to make yourself scarce.
RORY: Oh then I could be un-scarce. I could be here in all my plentiful gLory. That's more normal. God I forget what the protocol is when your mom is dating your dad.
LORELAI: Yeah, me too. We'll have to consult Emily Post again.
RORY: Yeah. But I really don't think it would be weird.
LORELAI: It wouldn't?
RORY: No. I mean, if it was, it wouldn't be weird in a bad way. If that's what you want.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: Is that what you want?
LORELAI: I don't know. No. Not now. Maybe...I want it. I don't know. Twizzler?
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay.
[They both sit on the couch, facing each other.]
LORELAI: [Sighs] It's good, though. You know? He and I, between us -- it's -- it's going good.
RORY: Well, good.
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: When I had lunch with him the other day, he said things were really go.
LORELAI: He did?
RORY: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: What'd he say?
RORY: Um, nice things.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Like what?
RORY: Nice things.
LORELAI: Did he talk about my sparkling eyes and my glossy, raven hair?
RORY: Look I'm not gonna pass notes between you guys.
LORELAI: What if Emily Post says that's part of the appropriate protocol?
RORY: If you can get it in writing from the ghost of Emily Post, then I will pass as many notes as you want. But, mom...
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: I'm really glad things are good between you.
LORELAI: Me too.
RORY: I'm just...
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: I just want you to be careful.
LORELAI: Is this the safe-sex talk? Because even if the ghost of Emily Post says it's okay, it is just plain weird.
RORY: No. Mom, I want you to be careful with you, with him. I just don't want to see you get hurt again.
LORELAI: I am. I am being careful.
RORY: Okay. Good.
LORELAI: Oh, my gosh. Am I coming with you to college?
RORY: Excuse me?
LORELAI: You totally want me to come to Yale with you, don't you?
RORY: What? No.
LORELAI: Then why are you packing all of my clothes -- my pink t-shirt?!
RORY: Where'd that come from?
[Lorelai starts pulling cloths out of a bag]
LORELAI: Oh, my goodness. That is so nice of you to think of me in school -- my sweet skirt! I hope you brought a toothbrush 'cause, boy, oh, boy, are we gonna have fun! My cozy sweater...
OPENING CREDITS
LUKE'S DINER
LUKE: Okay, two eggs over-easy, hash browns cooked well, whole-wheat toast buttered, and with a side of marmalade.
KIRK: [Sighs loudly]
CUSTOMER: Thank you.
LUKE: You're welcome. [To Kirk] All right, what can I get you?
KIRK: [Sighs loudly]
LUKE: Kirk, you're scaring away the customers.
KIRK: [Sighs loudly]
LUKE: I am not gonna ask you what's wrong. Either eat or go.
KIRK: Women troubles, Luke. Haven't slept in days. See the bags under my eyes? See the glazed look? Women.
LUKE: See this glazed look? Don't care.
KIRK: Mom's been incredibly possessive lately, as has Lulu, and it's very tense. I noticed they were beginning to snipe at each other, but I figured it was a friendly competition I could work to my advantage, you know? When you've got two women making you cherry cobbler, you're likely to end up with some pretty good cobbler.
LUKE: Basic capitalism.
KIRK: That's not how they see it. Oh, no. Apparently, it's mom's cobbler or Lulu's cobbler. I've got to choose.
LUKE: Are you gonna order something?
KIRK: I'd love to order something. I'm starving. But what should I get? Lulu would want me to get something hip, like a bagel.
LUKE: Hip?
KIRK: But mom would say a growing boy needs something more substantial, like pancakes.
LUKE: Well, neither of them are here, so what do you want?
KIRK: I don't know! Bagel, pancakes, bagel, pancakes... it's like their voices are blocking out my voice, and I don't know what I think anymore. I'll have a bagel and pancakes, I guess.
LUKE: Yeah, what kind of bagel?
KIRK: Lulu would k*ll me if I got the onion, you know, 'cause of all the kissing…
LUKE: [Looking discussed]
KIRK: And mom would freak over the poppy seed 'cause she thinks poppies are a gateway drug.
LUKE: What about... [Asian Caesar hands Luke a plate] egg? Egg, it is.
[Anna comes into the diner]
ANNA: Hey.
LUKE: Hey. I didn't expect you till later.
ANNA: I know, but I wanted to go over April's schedule before I brought her by.
LUKE: Okay.
ANNA: Is this a good time?
LUKE: Sure, let's sit.
ANNA: Great. [Sighs] So, this is her schedule. I think I erred on the side of too many details.
LUKE: I like details.
ANNA: These are some of the phone numbers you might need -- pediatrician, dentist, orthodontist -- if her retainer breaks -- optometrist...
LUKE: If her glasses break.
ANNA: So, my mom has her back surgery on Monday, but, apparently, the recovery process is really slow, so I'm gonna be in New Mexico for at least two weeks.
LUKE: It's fine. April can stay with me as long as you need her to.
ANNA: Thanks. I really appreciate this.
[Luke smiles back]
LUKE: All right, so what's this packet?
ANNA: Registration forms, some waivers -- April will need to have this when she goes to school tomorrow. And she will tell you she needs to be there at 7:30, but she really doesn't need to be there until 8:00. Anyway, it's all in the notes.
LUKE: Don't worry.
ANNA: I'm not worried. [Chuckling] Okay, maybe a little. It'll be fine?
LUKE: It will be fine. I promise.
DRAGONFLY INN – KITCHEN
LORELAI: Wow! Today's secret ingredient is gourds!
SOOKIE: Aren't they beautiful?
LORELAI: I guess that depends on the beholder's eye.
SOOKIE: Jackson's whole squash crop went crazy this year. We had such a hot summer, and these babies love the sun. You've got to try this soup.
LORELAI: Wait, is that gourd soup?
SOOKIE: It's so good. It's sweet and rich. It's like pie, only it's soup. It's like pie soup!
LORELAI: Na, I don't eat orange food, except for candy corn.
SOOKIE: You eat Cheetos.
LORELAI: I don't eat food that's naturally orange.
SOOKIE: You eat oranges.
LORELAI: Okay I eat food that's naturally orange, but I don't eat gourds.
SOOKIE: Fine.
LORELAI: What else is going on at home?
SOOKIE: Ooh! [Gasps] Martha is so close to walking. She's right on the verge. Why don't you come over tomorrow night for dinner? Maybe you'll see the inaugural steps.
LORELAI: Um, I'd love to, but...
SOOKIE: But you want to wait to see if Christopher calls and asks you out first, and then if he doesn't, you'll come over.
LORELAI: Something like that, yes.
SOOKIE: You two have been seeing quite a bit of each other lately.
LORELAI: Yeah, we're just dating.
SOOKIE: Right, 'cause you can just date the father of your child.
LORELAI: Turns out you can. It's been a fun six weeks. We're taking things slowly and just getting to know each other again.
SOOKIE: Except for the fact that you've known each other for more than 30 years.
LORELAI: [Imitating Sookie] Okay, I get it. Please get off my back, and stop talking like this.
SOOKIE: Okay, it's just that you and Luke haven't been broken up all that long.
LORELAI: I know. I remember. I was there.
SOOKIE: Okay. It's -- you know, after breaking up out of a big relationship it's normal to have a rebound thing. You know, a big, bouncy, rubber ball of a rebound thing. It's...good.
LORELAI: But?
SOOKIE: But a rubber ball is a 28-year-old surfer or a jazz saxophonist who drives a V.W. Bus or a really cute guy that can't even spell his last name. It's not the father of your only child. Christopher is not your rubber ball.
LORELAI: Okay.
SOOKIE: He's a big, heavy bowling ball.
LORELAI: I'm gonna tell him you said that.
SOOKIE: I just want you to be careful.
LORELAI: Okay god, I feel like I should set up traffic cones around me for all the people worrying about my safety. I am being careful, okay? [Cell phone rings]
SOOKIE: That's all I want.
LORELAI: All right.
SOOKIE: Great.
LORELAI: Fine.
SOOKIE: Good.
LORELAI: Good.
SOOKIE: Better.
LORELAI: [Answering the phone] Hi, Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: Lore what's your life looking like tomorrow night? You available?
LORELAI: Well I don't know, is there some particular reason you're checking my availability?
SOOKIE: [Bangs pot lid] Sorry.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, I have an idea for a really fun date, and if, in fact, you are available, I will put thought into action.
LORELAI: I thought our last date was pretty fun.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, this will be even more fun.
LORELAI: "Snakes on a boat"?!
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles] I'll pick you up at 6:00.
LORELAI: Okay, I'll be there at 6:00 to be picked up.
SOOKIE: [Bangs knife] Sorry. These gourd rinds are really thick.
LORELAI: [to Chris] What is the, uh, fun date?
CHRISTOPHER: No hints.
LORELAI: I hate not knowing things.
CHRISTOPHER: I know. I'll see you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Okay. Bye.
SOOKIE: [Singsong voice] Sounds like somebody's got a date.
LORELAI: [Imitating Sookie] Sookie.
SOOKIE: [Normal voice] Sorry. [Deep voice] Sounds like somebody's got a date.
LORELAI: Nice.
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Rory is unpacking, and gets the Rocket out and places it on a table, Looks at a clock, gets out her phone and calls Logan.]
LOGAN: [answering service] Hey, this is Logan Huntzberger. Leave a message.
RORY: Hey, it's me. I just got back to Yale. I thought I would try you and see if you're there, but you're not. [Chuckles] I thought you would be, but you're not. Fascinating, my thought process, isn't it? Okay, I'll talk to you later. Bye.
[Hangs up then the cell phone rings]
RORY: Hey!
RICHARD: Well, hello, Rory. You sound chipper.
RORY: Oh, hi, grandpa.
RICHARD: You're back at Yale?
RORY: Yep. Back at Yale.
EMILY: [In the back ground] Tell her the good news, Richard!
RICHARD: I'm coming to that.
EMILY: [Yelling] It's very exciting!
RORY: What's exciting?
RICHARD: Well, when I was at my Yale class reunion, I had a chance to meet one of my former classmates, Harold Laken. You know him as the dean of undergraduate education. Harold was also a fellow Whiffenpoof.
EMILY: The news, Richard!
RICHARD: Yes, right well I-it seems there was a sudden vacancy in the economics department, and they need someone to teach a course this semester, and Harold immediately thought of me.
EMILY: Can you believe it? Your grandfather, a professor!
RICHARD: I'm just a visiting lecturer.
EMILY: [Looking at a jacket] Too starchy. Too starchy?
RICHARD: No, I like -- I like --
EMILY: Too starchy.
RICHARD: What I want to know is whether you'd be okay with this. I'm gonna be on the campus at the same time you are, and there's a chance we might run into one another.
RORY: I promise, you will not cramp my style.
RICHARD: Well, that's wonderful, because I have to admit, I'm really quite excited about it.
RORY: That's great, grandpa. Congratulations. Well, why don't we meet up after your first class and grab dinner and celebrate?
RICHARD: Oh, I would love that, but I've already scheduled dinner with Harold.
EMILY: But, Richard, we have dinner with the Sudburys on Thursday. Remember? We're going to the hill house.
RICHARD: Well, I'm sorry, Emily, but I have dinner with the dean, and you can't expect me to include the Sudburys in that. They are insufferable bores.
EMILY: No, of course not. I'll just have to have dinner with the sudburys alone. Oh, the life of a faculty widow!
RICHARD: Did you hear that, Rory? She's already turned on me.
RORY: I heard it, grandpa.
LUKE'S DINER
LUKE: [Reading] Razor blades? They've expressly forbidden razor blades?
KIRK: That's sound policy.
LUKE: Are kids at this school showing up with razor blades? I mean listen to this list of stuff they've had to ban. Drug use, bullying, graffiti, theft, spitting, fighting – including but not limited to punching, kicking, gouging, and biting. Seems to me like they're just giving the kids ideas. "Gee, I can't think of any other bad things to do today. Let me look at the manual. Hey, gouging sounds fun!"
MISS PATTY: No one at that school is gouging anyone.
LUKE: Well, sure. Why bother with that when they've got access to g*n, Tasers, knives, and Nunchakus?
KIRK: Nunchakus are cool -- and deadly.
CAESAR: That's ridiculous. Nobody's bringing Nunchakus to April's school.
MISS PATTY: Of course not.
CAESAR: They're way too bulky to fit in your sock. Now, mace, on the other hand…
LUKE: Mace! kids are walking around with mace?
MISS PATTY: Oh, honey, calm down. Nothing's gonna happen to April. They just spell out that stuff for their legal protection. Whenever you're taking care of kids, that's a lotta liability. It's the same with my dance school.
LUKE: And nothing bad ever happens?
MISS PATTY: Nothing ever happens. Oh, except for that one time.
LUKE: What one time?
MISS PATTY: Well, I took my senior ballerinas to try out for a performance of "The Nutcracker," and one of the girls pulled a Tonya Harding and knocked the front-runner for Clara out of the competition. Broke her leg in three places.
LUKE: That is not nothing. That is the opposite of nothing.
MISS PATTY: It's totally different. That was a much rougher crowd.
LUKE: Rougher crowd? They're ballerinas.
MISS PATTY: Oh, yeah. I know. Everyone thinks, "ballerinas -- so sweet, so fragile." Trust me, they're dancing on stress fractures and ingrown toenails, and they haven't eaten in weeks.
[The door bell rings]
APRIL: Hey.
ANNA: Sorry we're late. We were half way here and April remembered the avocado pit was still in the kitchen, so we had to go back.
APRIL: We had to make to make a pit stop.
LUKE: [Laughs]
MISS PATTY: Hey, honey.
APRIL: Hi!
LUKE: You remember Miss Patty.
APRIL: Sure!
LUKE: And Kirk.
KIRK: Yo.
LUKE: And Caesar.
CAESAR: Hey April.
ANNA: Look I hate to have to rush, but I actually have to rush.
LUKE: That's fine. You go.
[Anna and April hug]
APRIL: Bye, mom.
ANNA: Ooh, I love you, sweetie.
APRIL: Say hi to grandma.
ANNA: I will. I'll call you when I get there. [Too Luke] Take care of her.
LUKE: I will.
ANNA: Okay, then. Bye.
APRIL: So, is there somewhere I can put the pit down?
LUKE: Oh, you know what? Go on upstairs, and I'll bring the bags.
MISS PATTY: Look at that turnout. And the hips of Anna Pavlova. [In Russian accent] You must bring her to my ballet class.
LUKE: Where ballerinas are maiming each other to be in "The Nutcracker"? Fat chance of that.
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke and April enter the apartment]
LUKE: Okay, here we are. You remember the place. All right. Here's your bed, and a here's the desk. I thought you could do your homework on it. A little chair for reading. I know how you like reading. And this is your dresser. Now, if you have a hanging bag for, like, dresses, you can just hang it in my closet, but I don't seem to remember you wearing a lot of dresses.
APRIL: Not big on dresses.
LUKE: All right, what else? Here's your kitchen, my bed, bathroom's back there, and the TV. I had a remote but I lost it, so you're gonna have to change the channel by hand by turning this knob here. And here's the telephone. If you're on it and you hear a beeping sound, that's call-waiting, so you've got to hit the flash button to switch over to the other call.
APRIL: Maybe I should write all this down.
LUKE: Oh, sure! Sure!
APRIL: I was just kidding. I know how call-waiting works.
LUKE: [Chuckling] Of course you do. You probably also know how to open up a refrigerator and turn on a sink. Okay, well, uh, I'll get out of your way, and you let me know if you need anything.
APRIL: Actually, my avocado pit needs light, and it's kind of dark in here.
LUKE: Well, there will be a little more light in the morning.
APRIL: Will there be less brown in the morning?
LUKE: You know, this place is kind of depressing, isn't it?
APRIL: [Laughs] I'd say. Sorry if that hurt your feelings. Mom says bluntness isn't my most attractive quality.
LUKE: Well, maybe we can pick up a few things. I don't know, some pillows, a rug. You know, lamps -- lamps brighten.
APRIL: Hey, we could go to "Targét."
LUKE: Oh, sounds kind of fancy.
APRIL: No. No, that's just how we say "Target."
LUKE: Oh, never been.
APRIL: [Laughs] Wow. Um... I don't think I've ever met a person who hasn't been to target.
LUKE: Well, now you have, so if you say that's the place to go, so that's where we'll go.
APRIL: It's the place to go.
LUKE: Okay, so how about tomorrow, after I close up?
APRIL: Cool.
LUKE: Cool! Alright I'll let you get settled in.
APRIL: Okay.
LUKE: All right.
[April puts the avocado pit experiment near a window, as Luke leaves, looking very proud.]
YALE NEWS ROOM
RORY: Everyone, congratulations. The first issue of the year is officially locked down. [Light cheering] And special kudos to bill for landing the front page with his campus housing exposé, "dormitory or death trap?"
SHEILA: Nice alliteration.
BILL: Slugline's half the battle.
PARIS: Dormitory renovations -- that's quaint. I recently had the opportunity to be a fly on the wall at the Hartford Courant as the editor selected their lead story. It was down to the wire, and I was on the edge of my seat when right at the last second, a local-corruption story broke. It was thrilling. It made this place look like a joke.
RORY: Your point, Paris?
PARIS: Oh, I thought I was clear. Compared to the courant, this place is a joke.
RORY: Okay. Assignments. Bill, you'll go with part two of the campus-housing series.
BILL: Got it.
RORY: We need someone to cover the board of trustees meeting.
JONI: I'm on that.
RORY: Thanks, Joni. And I want to do the traditional freshman class composition article, but I think we need to go deeper than just ethnicities and hometowns. I mean, what is the class of 2010 really about? Maybe take a different look.
PARIS: At the courant, they use Indesign to integrate the words into the photos.
Gee, do you happen to have an "in" at the courant?
JONI: Like, maybe your boyfriend, Doyle? What is he, a fact-checker?
PARIS: The most requested fact-checker at the paper. He works seven days a week just to keep up with the demand for his fact-checking.
SHEILA: Maybe he's looking to get away from a certain lunatic.
PARIS: Jealous much, Sheila?
SHEILA: Yeah. You got me.
A.K.: So, the art-show piece. I've got a problem.
RORY: Animal, vegetable, or mineral?
A.K.: I kind of had a thing with one of the artists in the show.
RORY: Okay. Animal.
A.K.: I just can't do it.
RORY: That's fine. I can do it. That's it. Class dismissed. So, you want to go to this art-show thing with me tonight?
PARIS: Sorry can't, Doyle's celebrating his one-month anniversary with the paper. Having drinks with the staff bigwigs over at Duffy's.
RORY: Cool.
PARIS: Yeah. He's pretty loved. Actually, we both are. We're like the Ephron and Bernstein of the group. I think it's going to be quite a fete. Doyle says the editor of the metro section might even show.
RORY: That's cool. Well, I can just go by myself.
PARIS: You know if you're desperate, you could force one of these staffers to go. I used to do that all the time when I was editor. I dragged Bill everywhere. That is, until the time I picked him up to go to the groundbreaking for the new chemistry research building, and he was wearing a cable-knit sweater that had "date" written all over it. As if.
RORY: I'm not desperate.
PARIS: Look don't give me those Rory Gilmore puppy-dog eyes. Even if I am your best friend, I have to look out for my career first, then Doyle's, then you.
RORY: Go to your party, Paris. Be the couple whose divorce was so painful that it was memorialized in both literature and film. I'll be fine.
PARIS: Oh, yeah. Now it's just sad.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai comes down the stairs as the doorbell rings]
LORELAI: Huh! Um... kind of, uh, casual, seemingly routine dating clothes.
CHRISTOPHER: Was that intended as a compliment? 'Cause it didn't come out like one.
[They kiss]
LORELAI: No, you look good. But how hard is it to look good when you know where you're going? Not that hard.
CHRISTOPHER: I could get some points.
LORELAI: I, on the other hand, had to come up with an outfit that could easily convert from totally formal to totally casual with just a few moves. Look, here I am, all ready for an elegant, New York night on the town, carriage ride through the park, dinner at Pastis, drinks at the Aalgonquin, but if I change my shoes and throw on a cardigan and add necklace number two, then I am ready for a concert at the new haven green, or I could use my cardigan to cover up the security camera in case the date turns into some sort of heist.
CHRISTOPHER: I'd prefer the sexy shoes to the sandals, but you should be comfortable.
LORELAI: Comfortable? "Comfortable" like we're gonna eat Moroccan and sit on the floor, or "comfortable" like we're gonna go up steps? [starts jumping] Steps? Steps? Steps? Are we going to the met?
[they kiss again]
CHRISTOPHER: No hints.
[leaving the house they go outside]
LORELAI: So, tell me now. Now! Tell me! [Gasps, as she see a classic old red Mustang convertible] Oh, hello, "b*llet." Are you taking me on a car chase through the streets of San Francisco?
CHRISTOPHER: It's cool, right?
LORELAI: It's really cool.
CHRISTOPHER: You like it?
LORELAI: I love it. So is this the thing?
CHRISTOPHER: It's a thing.
LORELAI: But is this the special thing you planned? 'Cause if it is, I want to give it its due. If it's not, I want to have the proper level of enjoyment while still reserving myself for the actual special thing.
CHRISTOPHER: The car is part of the thing. It's not the whole thing.
LORELAI: Alright I don't want to peek too soon.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah that's never good.
LORELAI: Ooh, You're being a gentleman. Is that the special thing?
CHRISTOPHER: I always open your door.
LORELAI: Bucket seats -- is that the special thing? No? Take a good, long look at my hair now 'cause it's not gonna look like this for the rest of the night. [Chris gets in and starts the car.] Rumbly engine -- is that the special thing?
CHRISTOPHER: Buckle your seatbelt.
LORELAI: Buckling my seatbelt -- is that the special thing?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, that's it. You're all buckled up. Date's over.
LORELAI: Oh.
LUKE'S APARTMENT
LUKE: Look at this -- 12-pack of socks for $6. 24 socks for 6 bucks. That's only 25 cents a sock.
APRIL: I knew you'd like it.
LUKE: Oh, this looks good.
APRIL: You picked it out.
LUKE: Well, you said tablecloth.
APRIL: That's true.
LUKE: What's the name of that blue again?
APRIL: Uh, cerulean. I'm really into cerulean.
LUKE: Yeah, I can see why.
APRIL: I used to be really into olive. Everything was olive, you know? It was my backpack, my pants, my sneakers. It was all olive. And then one day, I just -- I woke up, and I was like, "olive? I don't like olive. Not to wear, not to eat. Olive -- bleh."
LUKE: [Laughs] Well, you know what? I'm really glad we did it. We had fun, and the place looks great.
APRIL: And, you know, now, anytime you want, you can have a nice dinner on this table.
LUKE: That's true.
APRIL: You could put flowers in this vase and use it like a centerpiece.
LUKE: Uh-huh.
APRIL: You could dim the lights, light these candles.
LUKE: We can do it tonight if you want.
APRIL: Yeah. Or, you know, you could do it when you have a lady over.
LUKE: Oh?
APRIL: It'd be really nice. And she would be totally comfortable in here now.
LUKE: Right. Uh, you know what? Why don't we, uh, set up the desk lamp so you can get at your homework?
APRIL: Actually, they don't give homework on the first day of school. One teacher said he was gonna give us homework. He even wrote it on the board, but the homework was just, "cover your books." How lame is that?
LUKE: Very lame.
APRIL: I know.
LUKE: So I'll set it up so you can get to it tomorrow.
APRIL: Cool. Um, I'm gonna start covering my books. Can I grab some grocery bags?
LUKE: Yeah, go for it. It's under the sink.



UNKNOWN ROAD – NIGHT
[Chris and Lorelai and driving]
LORELAI: You know, you can admit it if you're lost. I will not lose any respect for you.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm not lost. Well, then, are you planning to m*rder me? Because people will notice I'm gone. They'll look for me. Paul Anka saw me leave with you. He'll bark. He will bark, and he'll sell you down the river. [Barking] Chris! Chris!
[They pull up at an old barn and Chris honks to horn]
LORELAI: Good, finally asking for directions.
CHRISTOPHER: We're here.
LORELAI: Here, where? Are we at Woodstock? I think we're late.
CHRISTOPHER: Shh! Just give it a minute.
LORELAI: [Gasps] Oh, are we meditating? I think you need a word to repeat. I don't have a word.
CHRISTOPHER: Stop talking.
LORELAI: That's two words.
CHRISTOPHER: Shh.
LORELAI: Oh. "Shh." I like it. Shh... [a projector starts up] Ooh! What the -- [Thematic music plays, Lorelai is surprised. "Funny Face" starts playing] I love this movie.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckling] Check the glove compartment.
LORELAI: Oh, my god.
CHRISTOPHER: Hold this.
[you can here the movie playing "...Your funny face"]
CHRISTOPHER: And... popcorn.
LORELAI: Oh, my god. You're unbelievable!
CHRISTOPHER: I thought it was time we saw a movie we wouldn't complain about.
[Military march plays]
LORELAI: I...
[Military march continues]
MOVIE: [woman speaking] Good morning, Mr. Ascot.
YALE – RICHARD'S OFFICE
RICHARD: [on the phone] mm-hmm. But I have to tell you, Emily, it's a whole new world from the one we remember.
EMILY: But the jacket was still appropriate?
RICHARD: Oh, the jacket was fine. Although I must say, I felt wildly overdressed. Boys in undershirts and filthy baseball caps -- the girls wearing pajamas and flip-flops.
EMILY: Well, it's the style, Richard.
RICHARD: Well, it's most peculiar.
EMILY: And you were firm with them? That's one thing that never changes. Young people respond to discipline. After all, you don't want your course to be known as a "gut." That's an easy class. I learned that term at dinner with the Sudburys, who learned it from their grandson, Paul.
RICHARD: And how are the Sudburys? I hope you gave them my regards.
EMILY: Of course. And they sent you theirs and then proceeded to bore me with the details of every stunning vista they witnessed on their recent cruise to Alaska. If you ask me, they saw more of the baked Alaska than anything else.
RICHARD: [Chuckles] You poor thing. You have a disappointing evening, and I have to give you the bum's rush to make my dinner with Harold at the faculty club.
EMILY: That's all right. You enjoy yourself. I probably won't wait up, so I'll say good night now.
RICHARD: Good night, dear.
[Police Siren chirps]
EMILY: Oh, for Pete's sake! What now?
[Emily pulls over]
POLICE OFFICER: License and registration, please?
EMILY: Why do you need to see my license? I wasn't speeding.
POLICE OFFICER: You were on a cell phone, ma'am.
EMILY: I don't see how that's your concern. Do my bills go to your office?
POLICE OFFICER: It is illegal in Connecticut to talk on a cell phone while operating a vehicle.
EMILY: Well, that is absurd. I can't talk on my own phone in my own car?
POLICE OFFICER: License and registration, ma'am.
EMILY: If I can manage to drink a cup of hot coffee and drive, I can talk on a cell phone. Or is coffee illegal, too? Can I listen to the radio? Can I open the glove compartment? Perhaps you should outlaw scratching your nose. That would certainly cut down on accidents.
POLICE OFFICER: Ma'am, have you been drinking?
EMILY: What? No! This is outrageous. You know, right now, someone is robbing a Kwiki mart, and you're standing there harassing me.
POLICE OFFICER: I'm going to need you to blow into this breathalyzer for me.
EMILY: Young man, I don't know where that's been, but I can say with absolute certainty it won't be going anywhere near my mouth.
ART SHOW
[Rory is waling through looking at the art displays and making notes]
RORY: Excuse me. Do you know what the light bulbs are all about?
[the lights come on and go out after a few seconds]
ELIJAH: Shock in your system.
RORY: Effective.
[Rory moves on and comes to a water cooler]
LUCY: What are you doing?
RORY: Um, me?
LUCY: She's touching your art.
OLIVIA: What are you doing? Are you actually drinking that water?
RORY: Oh, um, I didn't know it was art, I thought it was just a water cooler. There's no sign or anything.
OLIVIA: "Just a water cooler."
LUCY: That's her self-portrait. [Rory looks worried] I'm kidding! It's just a water cooler. [both girls start giggling]
RORY: Oh. Okay.
LUCY: We were messing with you. She is an artist, though.
OLIVIA: I made the horse.
RORY: Oh, I really like that one.
OLIVIA: Well, thanks.
RORY: It looks really big. It looks bigger than the doorway.
OLIVIA: Yeah well, it turns out it is, as I found out like four hours before the show was gonna start. I had to detach the head, then reattach it when I got here. Does it look crooked?
RORY: Um, not to me.
OLIVIA: No, it does.
LUCY: Oh if it does look crooked, which it doesn't, I think it looks better than it did before -- more jaunty.
RORY: What's it made out of?
OLIVIA: Cans mostly. Tinfoil. A couple hubcaps. I do stuff with found objects. I mean if you could call it trash, but that'd be kind of negative.
LUCY: She once made this sculpture of an old lady out of plastic sandwich bags and milk cartons, which was so cool. She's awesome.
OLIVIA: Oh, shut up!
RORY: So you're Olivia Marquont?
OLIVIA: Impressive.
LUCY: What are you, a spy?
RORY: Actually, I'm here for the paper. I'm Rory.
OLIVIA: Oh, the press. So what do you think?
RORY: Honestly, I don't know. I like your piece, and I think I like the robot in the underpants.
OLIVIA: The robot is genius.
LUCY: Olivia thinks everything is genius.
OLIVIA: Only genius stuff.
LUCY: Okay so, you're on the paper? Oh, my god, we used to be totally obsessed with this girl who was on the paper -- Paris Geller.
RORY: Sure.
LUCY: You know Paris?
RORY: I know Paris.
LUCY: Okay, freshman year, we were in this moral-reasoning class with Paris, and she was the most intense person we'd ever met.
RORY: Um, she's pretty much like that all the time. I actually went to high school with Paris.
OLIVIA: Paris Geller is a genius, and I will go to the mat on that one.
LUCY: Okay you've got to let us show you around the rest of the show.
RORY: That's cool.
LUCY: Come on we'll help you with your article, give you the skinny on everyone.
OLIVIA: Did you see the light bulb thing?
RORY: Um, my retinas are still ringing.
LUCY: Our friend Joel did that. He just transferred from M.I.T. Dude's wicked smart. His work is always about technology.
OLIVIA: I think Joel's a genius, but I'll admit, I could be biased by the fact that he's a total fox.
RORY: Is that the guy in the '70s prom tuxedo?
LUCY: No, that's Elijah. He's doing a performance piece. He's been doing it since we were juniors. Who knows if it'll ever end? Okay, you've got to see our friend kasha's piece. It's called "girl without clothes," and it's far out.
BARN MOVIE
[Movie is playing and there is music]
MOVIE: "You can't blame me for feeling avarice oh, S'Wonderful S'Marvelous that you should care for me [Music swells and ends]
LORELAI: Ooh, it's so good! It's so chock-full of...words like "chock-full." And even if Audrey Hepburn was 20 and Fred Astaire was, like, 80…
CHRISTOPHER: He's still Fred Astaire.
LORELAI: I mean, he could really tap-dance. That was so nice, Chris. That was so romantic and fun and wonderful.
CHRISTOPHER: S'wonderful?
LORELAI: S'Marvelous.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm glad you liked it.
LORELAI: I did. I really liked it.
CHRISTOPHER: You know, the evening doesn't have to end here. Gigi's staying with my mom. We could go back to my place.
LORELAI: Oh. That's nice.
CHRISTOPHER: N-nice?
LORELAI: No, that's not what I meant. Um...
CHRISTOPHER: We don't have to.
LORELAI: No, I want to.
CHRISTOPHER: You do?
LORELAI: I do, but I don't know if...
CHRISTOPHER: ...you want to.
LORELAI: ...If I should.
CHRISTOPHER: Ok.
LORELAI: I mean, everything's good, you know? It's going really good.
CHRISTOPHER: It's really good.
LORELAI: Yeah, and I'm feeling good.
CHRISTOPHER: But?
LORELAI: I don't, uh... know if I trust you.
CHRISTOPHER: Really?
LORELAI: Not just you. Me too. I'm not sure if I trust us yet with this.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh.
LORELAI: It's scary.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm scared, too.
LORELAI: I just hoped maybe... we could stay here in this place for a little while longer.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, it's gonna snow eventually.
LORELAI: Right.
CHRISTOPHER: It's fine. We should wait. I can wait.
LORELAI: Are you sure?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
LORELAI: Thank you. All this is perfect.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles] Okay. [Sighs]
LORELAI: [Lorelai's cell phone rings] Hello? This is she.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: Oh. Yes!
CHRISTOPHER: What is it? Who are you talking to?
LORELAI: Is she okay? What did she… okay. Where are you? Uh-huh. I know where that is. Oh… I'll be right there. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: We have to go. We have to pick up my mother… from jail.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles] Your mother's in jail?
LORELAI: Ooh, this night keeps getting better and better. Let's go.
LUKE'S APARTMENT
LUKE: [Sighs] You brush your teeth?
APRIL: They're brushed.
LUKE: So, there's a clear path to the bathroom. Can I get you a night-light?
APRIL: [Chuckling] I'm 13.
LUKE: I'll take that as a "no." I thought you didn't have any homework.
APRIL: I don't. This is more for pleasure.
LUKE: Sure. Sure, a little light reading before bed.
APRIL: I love my biology teacher. She is so smart, and she's really pretty. She has this long, brown hair that she kind of just whooshes up into a clip. She has all these piercings, but it's just on one ear, and she likes to fish.
LUKE: No kidding? A pretty fisher/scientist woman.
APRIL: And I know she's single because last year her name was Mrs. Johnson, and this year it's Ms. Kaplan, so I was thinking, one day, I could conveniently forget my biology book, and you could bring it by for me, and then maybe you could...
LUKE: Have dinner at the candlestick table with Ms. Kaplan?
APRIL: Exactly.
LUKE: [Sits on the end of April's bed and sighs] Look, April... [Sighs] I guess you know Lorelai and I broke up.
APRIL: Yeah, my mom sort of told me.
LUKE: Okay, well, sometimes that happens, you know? Sometimes it doesn't work out between people, and it's nobody's fault.
APRIL: It's all about pheromones.
LUKE: Right. [Chuckles] But I want you to know I'm okay, and you don't have to take care of me. I'm here to take care of you. Okay?
APRIL: Okay.
LUKE: Good night.
APRIL: Good night. Is it okay if I read a little more before I turn out the light?
LUKE: Real page-turner, huh?
APRIL: Oh, yeah. Mitosis is insane.
LUKE: Knock yourself out.
POLICE STATION
[Lorelai is really happy and taking photos on here cell phone of the officers]
LORELAI: Oh...got it! Thank you! Am I smiling too much?
CHRISTOPHER: You're smiling a lot.
LORELAI: All right, I'll try to bring it down a notch.
EMILY: Well, it's about time. Oh, good. I get to walk this filthy floor again. I don't need any help walking. Thank you! [an officer hands Emily her stuff, and puts on her shoes] Oh, thank you for giving me things that already belong to me. Well, you can all be very proud of yourselves. You're doing a crack job. You finally got menace-to-society Emily Gilmore off the streets. You'll be hearing from my lawyer. Come on. [pointing to Lorelai's phone] Put that thing away.
LORELAI: [takes a final photo] One, two, three! Ah! [Laughs] Smile! Cheese! Oh, I got you already. I'll get [Chris drags her away] okay, later. Bye!
DRIVING IN THE MUSTANG
[The top is still down, Chris and Lorelai are smiling and Emily is in the back not looking happy.]
LORELAI: Do you mind if I turn on the music, mom?
EMILY: That's fine.
LORELAI: Whatcha in the mood for? "Jailhouse rock"? "Folsom prison blues"?
EMILY: [sarcastically] You're very funny, Lorelai.
LORELAI: No, no, no. I know, I know. "Working on the chain gang."
EMILY: Yes, it's all quite amusing, isn't it? My being arrested, held behind bars, manhandled, and patted down? Hardee-har.
LORELAI: Aw. I just have one question for you, mom. Why on earth did you call me? I mean, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart for that incredible gift. You don't need to get me anything for the next five Christmases. But why did you call me, not dad?
EMILY: It was his first night teaching at Yale. He was having dinner with the dean. I'm not about to call him so he can excuse himself to come bail his wife out of jail. I can't begin to tell you how incompetent our police department is. That officer Peters who pulled me over -- he's going to be receiving a big, fat subpoena, and I'm not stopping there. [just noticing the car she is in] Wait. What is this? What's this car? What's going on here? Are you two on a date?
LORELAI: No way. You are not changing the subject. We're not talking about anything else except you in the clink. Now, come on. Spill. What was it like on the inside, huh? Did you try to tunnel your way out with a spoon? You know. Did they try to make you join a gang? And, mom, now that you're on the outside and they're still on the inside, are they gonna try to use you as some kind of prison mule? I just… so much I need to know! [Sighs]
HALLWAY TO LOGAN'S APARTMENT
LUCY: So, after my third callback, he says to me, "a girl can't play Oscar Wilde. I want people to take this production seriously," like he's Peter Brook
OLIVIA: or something and not some goateed sophomore from Arkansas.
LUCY: So I give him my most foppish stare and say, "life is too important to be taken seriously."
RORY: Nice.
LUCY: But on the way out, as I'm making my dramatic exit, I walk right into the glass door.
RORY: No. Ouch!
[they go into the apartment]
LUCY: So the next semester, he keeps hounding me about how I'd be perfect for his production of "California suite" because I have such a gift for physical comedy.
RORY: [Chuckles]
LUCY: [looking around] Holy crap! Your boyfriend is rich.
OLIVIA: And he's got some wild stuff. I mean, what's this about? [looking at the knight suit]
LUCY: Well, I must eat. I'm positively famished.
OLIVIA: Nice sound system [starts a CD]
LUCY: Do you have popcorn?
RORY: Um, yeah, there should be some in there.
LUCY: You have a hell of a lot of rice in here, Rory. White rice, brown rice, long-stem rice. You are simply crazy for rice.
RORY: Who doesn't like rice?
LUCY: Look who found an air popper!
OLIVIA: Genius.
LUCY: Now we just need some popcorn. Or something else that could be cooked in here. Rice. Who's up for a late-night snack of air-popped rice?
RORY: [Cell phone rings] Oh, wow, that must be my Logan call. I didn't realize it was so late already.
LUCY: Time flies when you're partying with artist.
RORY: Hey!
[Logan in his office]
LOGAN: Hey.
RORY: Hi.
LOGAN: What's going on? You having a party, Ace? Oh, no, I'm just hanging out with a few friends.
LOGAN: Just friends, huh?
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: Anybody I know or..?
RORY: No. Just some girls I met.
OLIVIA: Hi, Logan!
LUCY: Hi, Logan!
LOGAN: Just girls, huh? Your new boyfriend's not over.
RORY: Nope. Just us girls hanging out in our underwear, throwing pillows at each other – you know girl stuff.
LOGAN: Sounds very wholesome and loud.
RORY: Yeah, we're…
LUCY: Hey, Rory!
RORY: [to Logan] Um, hold on just a sec. [to Lucy] Yeah?
LUCY: This says it's popcorn, but it looks so fancy. Can I open it, or are you saving it for a special occasion or something?
RORY: Go ahead. [back to Logan] Hey, uh, sorry. Is it okay if I call you back later?
LOGAN: Sure, no problem. Have fun.
RORY: I will. Love you. Bye.
LUCY: Is that too much popcorn?
RORY: Uh, yeah.
LUCY: I'm really hungry. [continues filling the air popper and spilling it on the counter.]
OLIVIA: Okay. Someone's got some explaining to do. [holding up something that looks like you use to walk on snow.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
LORELAI: I mean they escorted her out in her stocking feet.
CHRISTOPHER: Her shoes in a bag.
LORELAI: Somewhere in my youth or childhood...
CHRISTOPHER: ...you must have done something good.
LORELAI: The universe owed me this one.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm glad you had fun.
LORELAI: I did. Didn't you have fun?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I did. It was great.
LORELAI: It was one of the "great" greats. What?
CHRISTOPHER: Nothing. I feel I may have gotten overshadowed a bit. I mean how's my little barn movie supposed to compare with your mom in jail?
LORELAI: Chris, no! It was just the cherry on top, the mint on the pillow of what was already a perfect night. No, I loved our date. It was amazing. I loved the movie. I'll never forget the movie I saw the night I picked my mother up from jail.
CHRISTOPHER: You're never gonna get tired of saying that, are you?
LORELAI: "Picked up my mom from jail"? No, I don't think I ever will. I'm just so glad you were with me tonight. I mean, anybody else who would have seen me laughing as I bailed my mother out of jail would have just thought I was completely deranged.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, I know you're deranged but for completely different reasons.
LORELAI: I mean, you just get it, and you make everything fun, and it's so nice to be with someone who understands you and makes you...
[they kiss]
CHRISTOPHER: I'll call you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Gigi's with her grandmother?
CHRISTOPHER: She is.
LORELAI: You want to come in?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah.
[they kiss as music from the movie plays again, "S'Wonderful S'Marvelous, That you should care for me"]

LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai is packing a bag, Chris and Paul Anka are sitting on the couch, Chris looks bored]
LORELAI: Okay. Toothbrush, hairbrush, hypoallergenic pillow, chenille blanket… ooh, comfort shoes. Got them.
CHRISTOPHER: Those are your comfort shoes?
LORELAI: Not mine -- Paul Anka's.
CHRISTOPHER: We're staying in tonight. You can probably get away with flats.
LORELAI: He loves, loves, loves chewing on these. They remind him of a squirrel carcass.
CHRISTOPHER: Yummy.
LORELAI: Don't judge. You eat jerky like it's going out of style.
CHRISTOPHER: So, all this stuff is for Paul Anka?
LORELAI: No, not all. The toothbrush is mine.
CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai.
LORELAI: What? It's his first night staying at your house. I want him to have all the stuff that makes him comfortable. Ooh -- tennis balls!
CHRISTOPHER: I actually have tennis balls.
LORELAI: Penn or Wilson?
CHRISTOPHER: You're joking.
LORELAI: Paul Anka's must be Penn. They must be new, they must be green -- not orange and green, just green. And FYI, you might want to watch that sarcastic tone of yours because dogs are very attuned to tone. It's kind of like Chinese, in that respect, dog language. It's very tone based. And you are stressing him out right now with your tone.
CHRISTOPHER: The dog is stressed?
LORELAI: Look at him. And when he gets like this, you need to talk to him in sweet and dulcet tones. [High-pitched voice] Hi, Paul Anka. Ooh, hi, boy! Hi! [Normal voice] Get it?
CHRISTOPHER: Got it.
LORELAI: Good. Sunglasses. [goes to get them]
CHRISTOPHER: [To Paul Anka] This is not normal. I want you to know that. [To Lorelai] The dog wears Ferragamos?
LORELAI: Oh, please. Don't give him any ideas. These are mine. All right, let's go. You take this, this, and this. Come on. What are you waiting for?
[They go out and close the door, Paul Anka whimpers a little, then Lorelai comes back]
LORELAI: Oops. Here, Paul Anka. [Claps]
OPENING CREDITS
HALLWAY TO LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Rory's phone rings]
RORY: [answers cell phone] Hey.
LOGAN: Hey, you watching it?
RORY: What?
LOGAN: The meteor shower.
RORY: What meteor shower?
LOGAN: It's on the news the BBC said there's some huge meteor shower tonight. I thought we could watch it together.
RORY: Uh, Logan, I have been in the library for the past nine hours. I don't know anything about any meteor showers. But I could use a regular shower, though.
LOGAN: Go up on the roof and check it out.
RORY: Now?
LOGAN: Yes, now! It's supposed to start in like two minutes.
RORY: But…
LOGAN: Ace! This is once-in-a-lifetime celestial event. Get going.
RORY: Okay, okay. I'm getting. I'm going.
LOGAN: Are you running?
RORY: I'm running! I'm running! Who knew you were such an astronomy buff?
LOGAN: Hurry!
RORY: What has gotten into you?
[Rory makes it to the roof]
LOGAN: Nice night.
RORY: Oh, my god! You're here! What are you doing here?
LOGAN: [Chuckles] Happy to see me?
RORY: Beyond happy! [They hug] Ecstatic! I can't believe you're here! And look at me -- I'm covered in highlighter ink and I smell like Fritos and ginger ale.
LOGAN: It's an aphrodisiac.
RORY: You're here and you did all this?
LOGAN: You like?
RORY: I love, but you didn't have to do this. I mean, you're here. It's enough. It's more than enough.
LOGAN: Could you shut up now so I can kiss you?
[They Kiss]
RORY: So there is no meteor shower?
LOGAN: No meteor shower.
RORY: So you used the entire cosmos to trick me?
LOGAN: I like to think big.
RORY: So, what is going on? What, Why are you here?
LOGAN: I'm kissing my girlfriend on the roof. Mmm.
RORY: But why?
LOGAN: The Fritos and Ginger Ale thing. I told you, huge turn-on.
RORY: [Sighs] Explain yourself.
LOGAN: I'm just here for a quick business trip.
RORY: How quick?
LOGAN: Too quick.
RORY: How quick is "too quick"?
LOGAN: I have 10:00 flight back to London tomorrow night.
RORY: Oh, that is too quick.
LOGAN: That website my team has been trying to buy -- the owners finally agreed to sit down, talk to us tomorrow over breakfast.
RORY: Logan! That's great, right? I mean, three weeks ago, they weren't even taking your calls.
LOGAN: It is great. However, not as exciting as kissing my girlfriend on the roof.
RORY: Um, so, what's that amazing smell?
LOGAN: Food from Ibiza.
RORY: The island?
LOGAN: The Tapas plAce downtown.
RORY: Ooh, did you get the duck?
LOGAN: I did.
RORY: And the short ribs?
LOGAN: Yes. And...
RORY: [Gasps] Ooh! A 2003 red something. Oh I bet it's very oaky and corky and full of fruity legs.
LOGAN: Know a lot about wine, do you?
RORY: Not so much, but the label's pretty.
LOGAN: There's also gazpacho, that cheese-pie thing you love, plus flan.
RORY: Ooh, flan! You got me flan?
LOGAN: Doesn't take much to make you happy, does it?
RORY: Not when you're on this continent.
LOG: Okay, why don't you open this wine? I want to taste those fruity legs, and I'll make you a plate with extra flan.
RORY: Okay. [starts to open the bottle but then runs to Logan] Ooh, I'm so glad you're here!
LOGAN: [Sighs]
CHRIS' APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai is on the couch, playing with the Tivo remote, Chris walks in]
CHRISTOPHER: Ha-ha! You're k*ll my Tivo.
LORELAI: I'm not k*ll it. I'm composing on it, I'm composing a symphony. Finally, an instrument I can play.
CHRISTOPHER: Give me that.
LORELAI: No, no, no!
CHRISTOPHER: Give me!
LORELAI: Not until you explain your choices.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: "The View"? "Girlfriends"? "S*Bado Gigante"? Who controls this thing, you or Pedro Almodóvar?
CHRISTOPHER: It's the nanny.
LORELAI: Sure, it's a likely story.
CHRISTOPHER: Give me, give me, give me.
LORELAI: Did Gigi Get to sleep okay?
CHRISTOPHER: She did. I tried to skip to the end of "Cinderella," but she wouldn't let me. It's my own fault. My wicked stepsister voice k*ll.
LORELAI: She's amazing, you know?
CHRISTOPHER: That reminds me.
LORELAI: Oh, no! You're not gonna show me some of her art, are you? I never know what to say in those situations. I mean, even when it was Rory's art, you know? Three blue finger smudges and some construction paper. It's not precocious. It's just messy.
CHRISTOPHER: Here. This came a couple of days ago. It's from Sherry.
LORELAI: From Sherry?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, it's the first I've heard from her since the divorce was final. Go ahead and read it.
LORELAI: Wow, how "Dangerous Liaisons" of her. She doesn't call. She doesn't e-mail. Then she sends you a letter with a wax seal that weighs roughly the same as a porterhouse.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, she had a lot to say.
LORELAI: Gosh. It's a lot of sorry.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, 15 pages worth. Believe me, I was not expecting this. Humility is not a side of Sherry I've ever seen before. I don't know if it's the yoga or the yoga instructor or…
LORELAI: Yoga instructor?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, she's dating her yoga instructor, Jean-Claude or Jean-Pierre -- one of those names that always sounds fake. Anyway, it sounds like she's really changed. She feels awful about what happened, run away like that and she wants to find a way to be part of Gigi's life again.
LORELAI: Honey, that's great.
CHRISTOPHER: Right?
LORELAI: Yeah… So, you got this two days ago and you're showing it to me now.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I was gonna show it to you, a couple of days ago but I figured you were coming over so...
LORELAI: No, I'm not criticizing.
CHRISTOPHER: You're not?
LORELAI: No, I'm complimenting -- badly, obviously. But I'm complimenting. You shared it with me.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I kind of thought that was how the whole adult-relationship thing worked. You know, openness, honesty.
LORELAI: Interesting. And you're sure you don't want to stash it away somewhere and then I find it -- accidentally, of course -- months from now, and I get all weird and insecure about why you didn't show it to me sooner?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm good with the sharing.
LORELAI: All right. It's another way to go.
[They sit back to watch TV]
CHRISTOPHER: [Evil voice] That glass slipper will fit my foot. [Normal voice] That was my wicked stepsister voice.
LORELAI: Yeah, I figured.
[Lorelai looks happy]
ROOF TOP
[Rory and Logan are laying on the floor]
RORY: I'm so happy.
LOGAN: Me too. [Kisses Rory on the head] You know you can't do this in London? The city lights are so bright, you almost never see the stars.
RORY: Yeah, but it's London.
LOGAN: Ah.
RORY: Wait, are you tired of London?
LOGAN: I'm tired of not being around you.
RORY: Yeah, but you can't be tired of London. Samuel Johnson said, "when you're tired of London, you're tired of life."
LOGAN: Obviously, the man was never in a long-distance relationship.
RORY: That's true. Boswell did keep quite close.
LOGAN: [Smooches] What are you doing?
RORY: Nothing.
LOGAN: You're trying to sneak a peek at my watch.
RORY: Well, I just can't believe it. I can't believe you're here. And I-I can't believe that you're leaving in only 26 hours and 45 minutes.
LOGAN: Come on think positive -- that's an entire lifetime to a fruit fly.
RORY: Actual you're thinking of a mayfly. Fruit flies can live for up to a month. So what do you think, can you stay for a month? I mean what if your meeting tomorrow goes really, really well?
LOGAN: I hope it does.
RORY: It will. It's a great idea.
LOGAN: It's basically MyspAce.
RORY: But by invitation only. And it'll be like an online version of the Algonquin group, like throwing a party in your head where everyone you've ever wanted to talk to is there -- Ira Glass, Sofia Coppola, Flaubert, Danger Mouse.
LOGAN: The deal's not done yet. Far from it. These guys aren't just gonna hand over their website because we buy them breakfast.
RORY: They might. Tell them that they can order pancakes and eggs. Don't make them choose. Sausage, bacon, fruit, potatoes -- let them get the whole combo. ‘Cause Then they will have to sell it to you. It'd be rude not to.
LOGAN: You are a business genius, Ace.
RORY: Well, I'm taking econ with my grandpa.
LOGAN: Whatever happens, we'll be ready. We've been working our asses off on this one -- Nick, Bobby, Phillip.
RORY: Oh, yes -- Phillip, Nick, Bobby. The team. Starting lineup.
LOGAN: It is a classic win-win. They give us a foothold in new media. We give them a huge influx of capital, which they need. Believe me when it comes to debt versus equity, they're screwed. They have no liquidity, huge expenses, zero revenue. I mean, the target advertising potential alone -- what? What are you staring at?
RORY: You, "Mr. Debt versus equity."
LOGAN: Are you mocking me?
RORY: Yeah, but I like it. Tell me more about this um, targeted advertising potential.
LOGAN: What do you want to know? There's pay-per-click, pay-per-lead, banner ads, pixel tagging.
RORY: Oh, stop. I'm getting weak at the knees.
[They kiss]
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Next morning, Rory is still in bed]
RORY: [reaching for Logan] Logan?
LOGAN: Shh. Go back to sleep. It's only 6:00.
RORY: In the morning?
LOGAN: Yes, in the morning. Go back to sleep. I'm sorry I woke you.
RORY: Hey, where you going? Come back here.
LOGAN: I can't I promised Nick, Bobby, and Phillip I'd meet up with them for breakfast before the pitch.
RORY: I thought the pitch was at breakfast.
LOGAN: It is, but we can't walk in there unprepared. We got to go over our notes, talk strategy. It's a pre-breakfast breakfast.
RORY: Work dork.
LOGAN: Did you just call me a work dork?
RORY: Admit it, just admit that you're a work dork.
LOGAN: I'll admit that I'm a work dork, if you admit that you love I'm a work dork.
RORY: Done. [they kiss]
LOGAN: Now I really have to go.
RORY: Hey, I have ways of making you stay, you know.
LOGAN: I know, I know, but take pity on me, please. After work, I promise I'm all yours. Dinner?
RORY: Is it a pre-dinner dinner or a real dinner?
LOGAN: As many dinners as you want.
RORY: Aw, man, I can't believe we've wasted 4 1/2 hours on sleep. What are we down to now, like 15 hours?
LOGAN: Rory, I'm actually gonna need both arms for this pitch.
RORY: Okay, I'll let go. Just one more kiss.
LOGAN: I don't believe you.
RORY: Try me.
[Logan moves in to kiss, then doesn't and walks off.]
RORY: [Gasps] Hey! No fair!
LOGAN: I'll call you later.
RORY: Work dork!
LOGAN: Work dork lover.
DRAGONFLY INN – RECEPTION AREA
MICHEL: [Sniffs] Gah. [Sniffs]
LORELAI: You need a tissue? Oh, god, what is that?
MICHEL: I don't know, but it's horrible.
LORELAI: Oh, it is. It's foul. It's like rotten cabbage.
MICHEL: Or with dense but subtle undertones of olives.
LORELAI: There's nothing subtle about it. It's like a sledgehammer to the nose.
SOOKIE: Oh, my god! What is that?
LORELAI: It's not coming from the kitchen?
SOOKIE: Bite your tongue. Are we having heart attacks right now? Isn't smelling something strange the first sign of a heart attack?
LORELAI: I don't think we're having a communal massive heart attack.
MICHEL: Carcasses.
LORELAI: What?
MICHEL: Those strange, angry-looking guests -- I'm sure they are traveling with decaying animal flesh.
LORELAI: Yeah, 'cause that's the most logical explanation. Gonna open a window, see if we can air it out a little bit. [opens the window] Gah! No, no, no!
SOOKIE: Close it! Close it! Close it!
LORELAI: Ugh!
MICHEL: So glad we tried that.
LORELAI: All right, I'm going out there to see what's causing this.
SOOKIE: Out there?!
MICHEL: Are you crazy?!
LORELAI: Maybe, but the sooner we can find out what's causing this, the sooner we can run like hell to less stinky ground.
SOOKIE: Well I'm coming with you!
MICHEL: Me too! Let's hang for a minute. If she makes it to the end of the block, we'll join her.
SOOKIE: Michel!
MICHEL: What? Fine. Ugh! [Coughs]
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
[They whole town is out covering there noses]
LORELAI: Kirk, where's everybody going?
KIRK: Taylor called an emergency town meeting. Not sure why.
SOOKIE: The smell, Kirk. The horrible, horrible smell.
KIRK: Really? [Sniffs] I just don't think it's that bad.
SOOKIE: Ugh. Well, come on, let's go.
LORELAI: No. You know what? On second thought, I'd rather smell this smell for the rest of my life than see Luke at a town meeting.
SOOKIE: Oh, honey.
LORELAI: It's okay. I'll go back to the inn. I'll be fine. Just call me when you want me to pick you up.
MISS PATTYS – TOWN MEETING
GYPSY: Finally!
MISS PATTY: It's about time, Taylor! We're dying here.
TAYLOR: I assure you, no one is dying. The substance causing this odor is not toxic in any way, shape, or form. It's pickles.
[The crowd begins to groan and continues to for most of the meeting]
SOOKIE: That's no pickle!
KIRK: Pickle? Like one giant pickle?
TAYLOR: Order! As those of you who take an interest in civic events may recall, three days ago a train derailed just east of town -- luckily, no one was injured. However, 3 1/2 tons of pickles and pickle brine were scattered along the tracks. And due to some inevitable delays in cleanup, those pickles have been baking in the sun for three days.
[The crowd groans]
MISS PATTY: And you knew about this?
GYPSY: It's a cover-up.
BABETTE: We got picklegate!
MISS PATTY: Ha ha ha!
TAYLOR: I did know about it, but it wasn't a problem until this morning when the wind shifted. And instead of wafting easterly toward our neighbors in Woodbridge, the smell seems to have settled on stars hollow. Now, there's no telling how long it will last.
[The crowd groans again]
GYPSY: What?! People are suffering here.
SOOKIE: How long does it take to pick up a few measly pickles?
TAYLOR: Picking up the pickles is not my main concern at the moment. Now, this is a matter of pride, people. A huge principle is at stake. There's absolutely no reason why we here in stars hollow should take responsibility for this mess. The pickles themselves hail from Ohio.
LUKE: Ohio?
TAYLOR: The railroad company is incorporated in the state of Delaware. And since all the pickles are on the Woodbridge side of the tracks…
LUKE: Just pick up the damn pickles, Taylor!
[Indistinct shouting]
TAYLOR: Easier said than done. Even if we wanted to do the wrong thing and assume fiscal responsibility for this fiasco, the cost is astronomical. $2,500 for…
LUKE: Sold!
GYPSY: Done!
BABETTE: Pay, you big cheapskate!
[The crowd starts yelling "yeah!"]
TAYLOR: Fine! All those in favor of stars hollow taking a swift kick to the tush and shouldering the entire cost…
[The crowd raise the hands and say "aye!aye!"]
TAYLOR: Very well. Motion carried. Pickle smell gone in 48 hours... along with everything good about stars hollow.
[They crowd leaves]
PARK
[Children playing on different play ground equipment]
LORELAI: Breathe that in. Isn't that fantastic? Forgot what fresh, pickleless air smells like.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, so, you coming over to my neck of the woods for lunch is really no reflection on how desperately you needed to see me?
LORELAI: Hmm...10% desperate need to see you, 90% pickles.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles]
LORELAI: You know, I'm actually looking forward to Friday night dinner. Because, as you well know, the Gilmore house, like very expensive vodka, is completely odorless.
CHRISTOPHER: And you still want me to come with?
LORELAI: Yes, you, me, Rory, numbers, babe.
CHRISTOPHER: Gigi, No. Skirt down! Gigi!
LORELAI: You may want to look into the whole skort concept.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, so, I spoke with Sherry this morning.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. What's the deal with her?
CHRISTOPHER: Well, first she and Gigi Spoke for almost half an hour.
LORELAI: That's as long as you can do anything when you're 4.
CHRISTOPHER: And then she and I talked. I thanked her for the letter. She said everything in it was true. She's totally serious about this new life thing. No more workaholic ways. She's gardening and meditating, all kinds of stuff. She's very self-actualized -- her words, not mine.
LORELAI: Good for her.
CHRISTOPHER: And the big news is, she wants me to send Gigi To Paris to stay with her for a couple of months.
LORELAI: Wow.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah wow, I mean, I know it seems kind of sudden, but Sherry's taken this huge leave of absence from work, and Gigi Got so excited. Why not, right? She's not in school, yet, just preschool, and she needs to get to know her mother sometime. [To Gigi] No, hey! Gigi, That's too high! Careful!
LORELAI: So, what -- would you go to Paris with her?
CHRISTOPHER: No, I was thinking the nanny could take her. She's dying to go. I mean, it's Paris, right? She's 25 years old. It's a chance of a lifetime.
LORELAI: Yeah, sure.
CHRISTOPHER: No, hey! Gigi, No, don't pick that up! I'll be right back.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
YALE NEWS ROOM
BILL: You can't put Paris in charge.
PARIS: She can and she should.
RORY: Guy's I just need someone to get the paper out tonight. Doesn't matter who. I want the chain of command to be clear.
BILL: When the editor in chief isn't here, the managing editor's in charge. That's standard operating procedure at every newspaper in the country.
PARIS: Yes, but I've done this 1,000 times, and you've never done it, bill. Experience.
BILL: Experience that led to a mutiny. It's not like anyone ever gave Captain Bligh another ship after the Bounty.
PARIS: Of course they did, multiple ships, and by the time he died, they promoted the guy to rear admiral. Do you think the British royal navy ruled the world in the 19th century by letting that much natural talent and leadership capability go to waste just because a few whiny complainers wanted more breadfruit and less scurvy?
BILL: [To Rory] Tell me you're not seriously considering this. The bunker. Do you not remember the bunker?
PARIS: I hardly see how my choice of workplace is relevant.
BILL: There was an insurrection, a revolt, an uprising. She was deposed.
PARIS: See how wordy he is? He overwrites. Plus, he's always been weak with gerunds.
RORY: [Sighs and then her cell phone rings] Sorry. Look, could you guys take this somewhere else?
BILL: Fine. Let's go to my desk.
PARIS: Your desk? Right, like I'm actually going to cede home-court advantage.
RORY: Oh, for god's sake.
RORY: [Answering the phone] Hey!
LOGAN: We did it, Ace! We bought the company!
RORY: What?
LOGAN: It's crazy we were just supposed to have breakfast. Next thing I know, we're sitting there with lawyers going over contracts.
RORY: Logan, that's amazing.
LOGAN: I know!
RORY: Was it all because of my breakfast-combo idea?
LOGAN: I'm pretty sure that's what sealed it. So will you come celebrate with me tonight?
RORY: I already cleared my schedule.
LOGAN: Great! I'll send a car. Tonight, you'll be dining with a captain of industry.
RORY: Wow, do you get to wear a uniform?
LOGAN: I'll have to check the fine print. Go home, get dressed. I'll see you soon.
RORY: Aye-aye, captain.
DRAGONFLY INN - RECEPTION
[Michel is on the phone]
MICHEL: Cancel? Well, I would say that depends. What exactly is your feeling about pickles? Uh-huh, yes, pickles -- gherkins, dills. For instance, if all the air around you smelled like pickles and there was no place to run, no place to hide, would you find that bothersome?
LORELAI: Michel, help. Let me in. [The door is chained to keep the smell out]
MICHEL: [On the phone] No, that is not a metaphor. Yes perhaps it would be better if you checked in tomorrow night. Uh-huh. Goodbye.
LORELAI: Michel, it's getting in my pores! My pores are pickling!
MICHEL: [Coughs, as he lets her in, he has put on a mask]
LORELAI: Sorry, I didn't mean to get you out of surgery.
MICHEL: Oh, mock the mask if you wish.
LORELAI: Oh, I will.
MICHEL: [Coughs, closes the door and sprays around it.] One is never too careful with toxic pollutants in the air.
LORELAI: Michel, it's just pickles.
MICHEL: Oh, so they say! Has anyone ever seen these pickles? Who's to say this is not some sort of chemical w*apon the government is testing on us behind our backs?
LORELAI: That's a cheery thought.
MICHEL: I have much scarier scenarios if you want to hear them.
LORELAI: Yeah, maybe later.
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
LORELAI: Hey. Wow, the smell is amazingly not terrible in here. What'd you do?
SOOKIE: Well, after the town meeting, I decided to make some baked apples with cinnamon and nutmeg.
LORELAI: This is apples and cinnamon?
SOOKIE: Mnh-mnh. The apples failed me. I mean, a terrifically famous smell, right? A powerful tool in the hands of a real-estate agent. Against the pickles -- powerless.
LORELAI: What is it? It makes me happy.
SOOKIE: The apples failed. I tried cheeses and breads and chocolates. But nothing could mask the power of the pickles.
LORELAI: You know I think my sense of smell is ruined. The insides of my nose are b*rned out.
SOOKIE: Then, I decided if you can't b*at them, join them. Embrace the pickle!
LORELAI: Milton Berle it smells like?
SOOKIE: Milton Berle, are you saying my kitchen smells like Milton Berle?
LORELAI: Milton Berle, "Broadway Danny Rose," Carnegie deli.
SOOKIE: Pastrami.
LORELAI: Pastrami!
SOOKIE: You want a sandwich? I'll make you a sandwich.
LORELAI: No, thanks.
SOOKIE: You sure? I've got pumpernickel. I've got rye. I've got this really nice mustard. I've even got dr. Brown's cel-ray soda in the fridge.
LORELAI: Nah, I filled up on lunchables in the park with Chris and Gigi
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Lunchables, huh?
LORELAI: Don't judge what you do not understand.
SOOKIE: So, Friday afternoon in the park with Christopher, huh?
LORELAI: Yeah, you know I will have one. Soda that tastes like vegetables -- who would have thunk it? Hey, uh, this kind of weird thing happened today.
SOOKIE: Oh yeah.
LORELAI: So, apparently Sherry is trying to get back in touch with Christopher.
SOOKIE: Sherry "ex-wife" Sherry?
LORELAI: Mm-hmm.
SOOKIE: Sherry "abandoned her baby to go live the life of a bon vivant" Sherry?
LORELAI: The very one. She wrote him a letter -- "mea culpa, mea culpa." She's learned the error of her ways. She wants to get back in touch with Gigi.
SOOKIE: Translation -- she wants to get back with Christopher.
LORELAI: No, I don't think so. She's dating someone. She's doing downward dog with some French yoga instructor.
SOOKIE: Sherry "mani/pedi twice a week" Sherry is doing yoga?
LORELAI: Allegedly. Who knows? But then Chris went on about sending Gigi To Paris with this 20-year-old nanny so that Gigi Can reconnect with her mom.
SOOKIE: And you told him that's insane.
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: What? Why not?
LORELAI: I don't know. Not saying what I think is not what I'm known for. If you know what I mean.
SOOKIE: No, no, I don't it's not what you're known for. It's what you're not known for. I mean, it's not what your not… you're usually quite frank.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: It sounds like you're not quite comfortable talking to Christopher.
LORELAI: That's the thing. I am.
SOOKIE: Well, then why didn't you?
LORELAI: Because in my head, I wasn't talking to Christopher. I mean in the park I was talking to Christopher but in my head, I was talking to Luke.
SOOKIE: Oh, honey, of course you were.
LORELAI: No, I-I don't mean it like I missed him. I mean it like Luke is the one who didn't want me getting involved in his kid's life, not Chris. Chris is open to what I think. Chris is open to me. [Scoffs] Christopher is not Luke.
SOOKIE: Nope, Christopher is not Luke.
LORELAI: Why aren't all nutritious things in soda form?
SOOKIE: That's a good question.
LORELAI: I swear I would eat my vegetables if only they were fizzy. [cell phone rings] Yay, Rory! Hello?
RORY: Hey, what's going on?
LORELAI: Uh, well Stars Hollow smells like pickles.
RORY: Pickles?
LORELAI: Pickles.
RORY: Pickles pickles?
LORELAI: Pickles.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Because a pickle train crashed.
RORY: Is this a joke, is this a long, boring joke that I'm not going to get?
LORELAI: No it's no joke the town smells like pickles because a pickle train was derailed.
RORY: A train full of pickles? Who knew there was such a thing?
LORELAI: Well, pickle-train conductors, for one. Sounds so fun. I would've been the greatest pickle-train conductor. Can you see me -- "all aboard, you pickles!"
RORY: Hmm. Clearly you missed your calling.
LORELAI: Well, luckily there's you. You're young, you're clever, you're our great pickle-train conducting hope.
RORY: I can't believe I'm missing this.
LORELAI: Well you can celebrate next year on the anniversary. Now what's going on with you?
RORY: Well, I can't make it to Friday night dinner tonight, but I have a very good excuse.
LORELAI: Pickle-train conducting seminar?
RORY: Logan's in town.
LORELAI: [Gasps] No way!
RORY: Yeah, he showed up last night. It was a total surprise.
LORELAI: I can't believe you let me go on about pickle-train conducting when you had actual news.
RORY: You had news. Stars hollow smells like pickles. I can completely see that scrolling along the CNN crawl.
LORELAI: Logan in town is totally pre-pickle news. How long is he here for?
RORY: 6 1/2 more hours. He flew in yesterday, bought a company, and he's flying back out tonight.
LORELAI: Oh my God, what are you guys gonna do with your precious remaining hours? Or don't I want to know?
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Well, because you might be farming rutabagas or something, and I wouldn't want to know 'cause -- boring.
RORY: Well, tonight I'm meeting him in Manhattan to celebrate.
LORELAI: Fancy restaurant?
RORY: Rutabaga farm, actually. Oh, but I'm sorry about dinner. I did not mean to abandon you in your time of need.
LORELAI: No worries I'm not gonna be defenseless. I'm bringing your dad.
RORY: Really? Wow!
LORELAI: Yeah, thought it was time he meet the parents.
RORY: Okay, that is pre-pickle news, my friend.
LORELAI: Oh, this conversation's been a disaster, hasn't it?
RORY: Yes, it has.
LORELAI: All right. Bring-bring. Hi, Rory. How are you?
RORY: Hi, mom. Logan's in town.
LORELAI: Oh, my goodness. That's wonderful.
RORY: We're farming rutabagas.
LORELAI: Oh, you're a filthy child. I will disown you. Bringing your father to dinner. Pickles, pickles, pickles, smell, pickle-train conducting.
RORY: Alas, alack.
LORELAI: Good talk.
RORY: The best.
LORELAI: Bye.



MANHATTAN RESTAURANT
[Rory enters]
MAITRE D': Good evening, I'll take that.
RORY: [handing over a wrap] Thank you. Um, I'm just meeting someone. Ahoy, my captain of industry!
LOGAN: Ace!
RORY: Hey, where is your uniform? I was expecting the whole works -- a spiffy hat, shiny shoes, epaulets with scrambled eggs on them.
LOGAN: Scrambled eggs on my clothes? What you must think of me. You look gorgeous.
RORY: Thanks.
[they kiss]
LOGAN: Though I was hoping you'd wear a nice little saiLor's middy. You look so cute in a middy.
RORY: Oh, I'd love to wear a middy. And a little sailor hat, like the stay puft marshmallow man.
LOGAN: Because who doesn't want to date a giant humanoid marshmallow?
RORY: I'm so proud of you.
LORELAI: Mmm. Come on. Our table's over here.
RORY: Okay.
LOGAN: Everybody, I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Rory.
NICK: Such a pleasure, Rory. I'm Nick.
RORY: Hi
LOGAN: And this is Phillip.
PHILLIP: Nice to meet you.
RORY: You too.
BOBBI: And I'm Bobbi. So, so glad you could join us.
RORY: [taken back by the beautiful blond] Bobbi, um...yeah, me too. I'm so glad I could make it. How are you?
BOBBI: I'm brilliant, actually. We had quite a day. Shall we order another bottle of champers, boys?
LOGAN: Absolutely.
BOBBI: Good. I'm parched. [to Rory] Do you drink?
RORY: What? Um, yeah, sure.
LOGAN: Here. Sit, sit.
PHILLIP: Food let's please get food. I haven't eaten since the waffles.
NICK: Good god did you eat those?
PHILLIP: It would have been rude not to.
NICK: You eat anything. You astound me.
LOGAN: You're like a human garbage disposal.
BOBBI: It's appalling, Phillip. Really it is. You now what you should do, you should go on one of those, um, American reality TV series and showcase your talents.
LOGAN: There are these huge waffles at the breakfast this morning.
RORY: And Phillip ate them. I'm catching on.
NICK: Logan I know we're celebrating, but I'm concerned about our budget for this project. From a strictly economical perspective do we really want to blow everything on feeding Phillip tonight?
LOGAN: Somebody's got to crunch the numbers.
PHILLIP: It's true. The numbers do not crunch themselves. Ergo, the number cruncher must be fed.
[Laughs all round]
BOBBI: So, Rory, I've heard so much about you!
RORY: [flustered] Oh, yeah?
BOBBI: Logan has talked my ear off about you.
RORY: Oh, yeah, yeah. Me too. He's talked my ear off about you and all of you. All of you, I mean, I'm practically Van Gogh from my earlessness.
BOBBI: Did we order champagne? Logan, your girlfriend must be parched.
LOGAN: Oh, excuse me, miss. I think we'd like another bottle, over here please.
PHILLIP: Oh, and bring another bread plate.
BOBBI: [Gasps, scoffs] You're amazing.
NICK: Ridiculous.
PHILLIP: I'm hungry.
CHRIS' CAR – NIGHT TIME
[Music plays]
LORELAI: oh, no. You know my rule about hair bands.
CHRISTOPHER: My car, my tunes.
LORELAI: Really? You're gonna say, "tunes"?
CHRISTOPHER: You got a lot of rules, lady.
LORELAI: Not a lot. It's just no saying "k*ll," no saying "whack," no saying "rockin'" or "pimping" or "slamming," capisce?
CHRISTOPHER: Fo' shizzle.
LORELAI: There's got to be an eject button here somewhere.
CHRISTOPHER: How's this for an idea -- weekend away, the two of us?
LORELAI: [Gasps] That's great for an idea. Ooh! Ooh! I know the perfect place.
CHRISTOPHER: Don't say "Dollywood." Please don't, don't say "Dollywood."
LORELAI: The ice hotel.
CHRISTOPHER: The what?
LORELAI: The ice hotel. It's amazing. I read about it in the travel section. It's a hotel totally made of ice. The roof is ice. The floors are ice. The chairs are ice. Chandeliers are ice.
CHRISTOPHER: I think I'm beginning to get the picture. Wouldn't it be amazing if you went down the hall and the ice machine was empty?
LORELAI: It is amazing.
CHRISTOPHER: Amazingly cold.
LORELAI: No. You get to wear parkas and fur hats.
CHRISTOPHER: "Get to"?
LORELAI: And you sleep under reindeer skins. You eat reindeer meat.
CHRISTOPHER: Again, "get to"?
LORELAI: You drink Vodka. That's a good "get to."
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, how's this for an idea? We can drink vodka in Bermuda.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] The ice hotel in Bermuda would totally melt.
CHRISTOPHER: We'll do two weekends away. First the ice hotel. Then once we've been treated for frostbite and had our stomachs pumped of reindeer meat, we'll go defrost on a beach somewhere. I mean, we've got the time. Gigi's gonna be in Paris for a couple of months.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: What? You're not down with the whole beach thing?
LORELAI: No, it's...more the whole Paris thing.
CHRISTOPHER: Yes?
LORELAI: I-I'm just... I'm not sure it's such a good idea that Gigi Goes to Paris.
CHRISTOPHER: Meaning?
LORELAI: Well, she's only 4 years old. She barely even knows Sherry.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, but Sherry's her mother.
LORELAI: A mother she hasn't seen in two years.
CHRISTOPHER: Look, Sherry's doing really well. You read her letter. And I think I've been doing a really good job with Gigi
LORELAI: Oh, honey. Amazing.
CHRISTOPHER: But it's hard, you know? I-it's -- it's really hard, and Gigi needs her mom. And if I can help bring them both back together, I-I-I want to do that. I have to do that.
LORELAI: I know, I get that. I just -- I think maybe you should put a little more thought into it, you know, before you send a toddler on an airplane with an 18-year-old nanny who's totally psyched to go to France.
CHRISTOPHER: The nanny's 25.
LORELAI: Oh, oh, okay, then.
CHRISTOPHER: Like the nanny's really your problem here.
LORELAI: Well, I mean, it's not an un-problem, you know? I think you should just consider it more carefully or maybe go yourself.
CHRISTOPHER: Look, I read her letter --
LORELAI: oh, my god! Enough! Enough with the letter already.
GILMORE MANSION
[They pull up at the Gilmore mansion and get out of the car.]
CHRISTOPHER: I get it.
LORELAI: What do you get?
CHRISTOPHER: This is about you being threatened by Sherry.
LORELAI: Oh, no. Give me a break.
CHRISTOPHER: You never liked her.
LORELAI: No, I didn't, but I don't like the new mailman either. Doesn't mean I'm threatened by him. This is about me thinking I could speak openly and honestly about my concerns without getting freaked out on.
CHRISTOPHER: Nice. Real nice.
LORELAI: Honey, what is going on with you?
CHRISTOPHER: What's going on with you, Lor?
LORELAI: Look, can we drop this, please, and try and have a nice evening?
CHRISTOPHER: It's dropped.
[They door opens]
EMILY: Well, hello, hello! Richard, they're here. Don't you two look marvelous? Well, don't just stand there. Come in, come in.
MANHATTAN – RESTAURANT
LOGAN: It was the way he kept saying "intellectual property." Each time he said it I could feel the whole deal just slipping through our fingers.
PHILLIP: He was like, "intellectual property, intellectual property."
LOGAN: "Which is like my property, my property, my property."
BOBBI: "I invented it, I invented it."
NICK: "We won't sell, We won't sell."
LOGAN: "And it's slipping, slipping."
PHILLIP: I'm looking at Nick trying to convey through subtle dilations of my pupils that we simply cannot offer any more money.
NICK: And I'm looking at Phillip who's looking at me like, like he's hopped up on some sort of methamphetamine.
LOGAN: Slipping, slipping, and it looks like we lost him, and then Bobbi.
PHILLIP: Bobbi makes a bold choice.
NICK: What does she do?
LOGAN: She just stands up.
NICK: She does.
PHILLIP: She just stands up!
RORY: Wow.
LOGAN: She stands up like she can't take it anymore, and she says, "meeting's over, boys."
RORY: That must have been crazy.
NICK: It was amazing. I'm sitting here, and she's here, and she stands up. And I look over, and all I see is legs, legs, legs and this look on her face like "ohh, no." It was brilliant Do it, Bobbi. Stand up.
BOBBI: Knock it off.
LOGAN: Come on, Bobbi. [to Rory] You got to see this.
PHILLIP: But we insist.
NICK: Please?
BOBBI: Fine. But just to shut you lot up. I suppose it was something like, um... [gets up] ...meeting's over, boys.
NICK: Whoo!
LOGAN: Whoo! Well done! Amazing Hu!
NICK: We need another bottle!
PHILLIP: And dessert. Don't we need a little sweet or something?
BOBBI: So, Rory, we've barely had the opportunity to speak all night.
RORY: I know.
BOBBI: How's school? What's your major?
RORY: English.
BOBBI: Oh, god, how fantastic. I swear when I was at oxford, I did nothing but read literature. It was such a luxury.
RORY: That's one way to look at it.
BOBBI: Oh, I long for those days. Just reading books, thinking.
RORY: I do like thinking.
BOBBI: Enjoy it while it lasts. Before you know it, you'll be out in the real world, with the rest of us poor sods.
RORY: Seems like you manage to have some fun.
BOBBI: Well Logan is a big part of that. He is such a laugh.
RORY: He's actually a lot more serious than you might think. It probably takes a long time to get to know that side of him, the serious side.
BOBBI: Oh, you two are so adorable.
RORY: Thanks.
PHILLIP: Hey, not so fast! We're still working on getting the next round. Another sloe gin fizz, please. Oh, and don't get too excited, fellas. I'm just going to the loo.
LOGAN: Yes! That's it!
NICK: Amazing! Magnificent!
PHILLIP: We fold, we fold. Thank you, thank you very much. And feel free to say all sorts of cheeky things about me while I'm gone.
LOGAN: Isn't she a riot?
RORY: Hilarious.
GILMORE MANSION – DINNING ROOM
[Dinner is under way, Chris and Lorelai do not look pleased with each other.]
RICHARD: Well, naturally I thought they were referring to the archduke. So I jumped in, as who wouldn't? With some thoughts about the various conspiracy theories surrounding his infamous assassination in Sarajevo. Imagine my surprise when I learned that Franz Ferdinand was the name of a very popular rock-'n'-roll band.
EMILY: [Laughs] That's what he gets for trying to fraternize after class with his students.
RICHARD: One of them even offered to burn a CD for me. [Chuckles]
EMILY: So, tell me. How are the salads?
LORELAI: Good, mom.
CHRISTOPHER: I like the pear.
EMILY: Do you?
CHRISTOPHER: Umm.
EMILY: I'm so glad.
RICHARD: Tastes very fresh.
EMILY: Well, pears this time of year can dress up any salad. Oh, Richard, did you tell them about midterms? Lorelei, did your father mention midterms?
LORELAI: No, he didn't. How were midterms, dad?
RICHARD: Well as you know, midterms separate the wheat from the chaff. Although I don't actually have to grade any of their papers or tests. They have these marvelous teaching assistants that handle all that sort of things for you.
EMILY: Thank you, Hildegard. Christopher, I hope you like lamb. When I found out you were coming I decided we had to serve something special. And to me, special means lamb. Oh, it just makes me so happy to see the two of you sitting here together. It's so much fun.
CHRISTOPHER: It's very nice to be here.
EMILY: Tennis!
RICHARD: Emily?
EMILY: That's one of the things we can do together as a foursome, now that Lorelei and Christopher are an item.
RICHARD: That's right. We do need new people for doubles.
EMILY: We've been playing with that awful Bunny Ferguson and her husband, whatever his name is.
RICHARD: They are dreadful.
EMILY: The way Bunny Ferguson grunts -- oh! I mean, it's one thing if you're Maria Sharapova and you're 120 pounds and a 7-foot blond teenager. But if you're 5'3"...
RICHARD: And 53...
EMILY: and wearing plaid -- did you see that skirt she wore the last time we played them?
RICHARD: I can only think that it was designed to cause some sort of optic misfunction.
EMILY: So then you'll play with us? Lorelei?
LORELAI: Hmm? Yes, fine, great.
EMILY: It's a date. How does the Saturday after next work for everyone?
LORELAI: Sure.
EMILY: Ah, here's the lamb. You do like lamb Christopher? I'm afraid I never let you answer.
CHRISTOPHER: I do, the funny thing is, I never did when I was a kid, but I do now. I guess I've changed. People do that sometimes.
LORELAI: [Scoffs]
EMILY: That's so true. What a clever observation. It's like you and radishes.
RICHARD: Exactly.
EMILY: Your father used to hate radishes, thought they were discussing.
RICHARD: Well, they are roots. It's a little unappealing.
EMILY: And then one summer in aspen, he fell off a horse, and suddenly he loved radishes. That whole summer, he was radish-crazy.
RICHARD: It's true. I do like radishes to this day.
LORELAI: That's funny.
EMILY: Isn't it?
LORELAI: Yes. I don't like radishes. I guess it's because I find them threatening.
EMILY: What a peculiar thing to say.
LORELAI: Well radishes are a peculiar topic.
RICHARD: All right. Since this is a special occasion of sorts, I should like to propose a toast. To many more nights like this, and to Lorelei and Christopher. Who knew 20-some-odd years ago that we would be making dates to play doubles tennis?
EMILY: And bridge. You absolutely have to join us for bridge.
RICHARD: You two have come a long way since your days of rebellious youth, shall we say?
EMILY: Derelicts. The word is derelicts.
RICHARD: Emily! To Lorelei and Christopher.
[They toast and drink]
EMILY: They were derelicts. It's true. Remember when they stole that bottle of wine you'd been saving for 15 years?
RICHARD: Well, 10 years. It was a '75 Margot.
EMILY: And they had no idea how to use a corkscrew, so they just cracked the top off with a brick and slurped what they could off the patio.
RICHARD: And look at them now. All grown up and drinking very nicely out of glasses.
LORELAI: [To Chris] I need to see you in the bathroom.
CHRISTOPHER: Fine. Excuse me.
BATHROOM
CHRISTOPHER: [Sighs] Uh, would you mind telling me what the hell…
LORELAI: you're not Sherry.
CHRISTOPHER: Excuse me?
LORELAI: You've changed, Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: Maybe we were derelicts back then. But we were 16. We were just kids. You were just a kid.
CHRISTOPHER: So?
LORELAI: So, you leaving Rory when you were 16 is not at all the same as Sherry, a grown woman, packing up and living Gigi So I get why you we upset with me. Because when I'm criticizing Sherry, you feel like I'm criticizing you. But I'm -- I wasn't. I'm not. You've changed. You're not 16. You're not a kid. You're not Sherry. I get it.
CHRISTOPHER: Wow, you get it. That's great, Lor. Thanks for telling me how I feel.
[Chris leaves]
MANHATTAN STREET
LOGAN: You tired?
RORY: I'm good.
LOGAN: I could always have the car come pick us up at the corner.
RORY: I'm fine.
LOGAN: Hey, I know. I could carry you.
RORY: Carry me?
LOGAN: Yeah, piggyback, fireman's carry, in both arms -- your choice.
RORY: No. [Chuckles] I'm really fine.
LOGAN: Wow, okay. So, I guess something's really wrong.
RORY: Just because I don't want to be fireman carried doesn't mean that something is wrong.
LOGAN: But something is wrong.
RORY: No, it's just…
LOGAN: Just?
RORY: This isn't exactly what I expected tonight. I was just a little confused, I guess. You called. You were so excited. You said, "celebrate." I thought it was gonna be just us.
LOGAN: Last night was just us.
RORY: I know, and it was also perfect and romantic. And the more I talk about it, the more I feel stupid for even bringing this up.
LOGAN: Look, I'm sorry I wasn't clear on the phone. I'm sorry that you didn't have a good time tonight.
RORY: Well, no, it's not that. I mean, I get it. The guys are great. Okay. But, technically Bobbi, well, she's not exactly a guy.
LOGAN: Yeah, you got me there.
RORY: And until about three hours ago, I thought that she was a guy. You know why? Because you never use personal pronouns -- "she," "her." I mean, would that have been so unbelievably difficult to fit into a conversation? I don't know about you, but most of the Bobby's I know are guys -- Bobby Kennedy, Bobby Brady, Bobby Knight, Bobby Brown. You're smiling at me. Why are smiling at me?
LOGAN: Because you are very cute when you're jealous.
RORY: I'm not jealous.
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: Oh, and it's not just that. I mean, it was everything. It was not feeling like I was included. I mean, no one all night asked me anything about me.
LOGAN: Bobbi asked you about you.
RORY: Yeah, and how condescending was she? [Imitating Bobbi] "It's such a luxury to read literature." And did you hear what she called us? "Adorable." She called us an adorable couple.
LOGAN: Wait, she said that out loud?
RORY: Yes, adorable.
LOGAN: Wow, you want me to go back there and kick her ass?
RORY: "Adorable" is what you say about a "full house" rerun. It's not what you say about something that lasts. The great wall of china, the pyramids -- no one ever called them "adorable." And excuse me, but how many times does a girl need to stand up at dinner? Yes, you have legs. We get it. "Oh, no, I'm not leaving. I'm just going to the loo." Here's a tip. You're in America now. Speak English.
LOGAN: Okay so just to clarify, in the future, you would prefer I work only with girls who have no legs.
RORY: You're not taking me seriously.
LOGAN: Because you're not being serious. Bobbi is my colleague. She's great at what she does. She's smart. She's talented. Nick has great legs, too. Maybe before you rush to judgment, you should check his out.
RORY: Great so now I'm not just an idiot, I'm an anti-feminist idiot, an anti-feminist who's standing here in the street arguing about things I don't really want to be arguing about.
LOGAN: You don't?
RORY: No. Do you think I like feeling this way? I mean, I haven't seen you for months and months, and now you're in town for what? 26 hours? And in that time, I can't just get happy and act like a fruit fly?
LOGAN: Mayfly.
RORY: I can't just live in the moment and enjoy the 26 great hours ahead of me? I have to be sulky and miserable while all the other fruit flies share private jokes with my boyfriend? You think I like this about myself? Wrong. I hate myself for being this way. I hate Bobbi for her professionally tweezed eyebrows and her oh-so-incredible ability to stand up at a moment's notice. And most of all, I hate the fact that in a few seconds you'll be in that car leaving me again.
LOGAN: That is a hell of a long way to go just to say, "I miss you."
RORY: Any thoughts in response?
LOGAN: I miss you, too, Ace.
RORY: Five words. You only used five words.
LOGAN: Yeah, well, I'm not done yet.
[they start to kiss]
GILMORE HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Chris and Lorelai look bored]
EMILY: Of course, this time of year, so many people start playing that awful winter tennis with the chicken-wire cages and the heated courts.
RICHARD: Platform tennis can be very enjoyable, Emily.
EMILY: Yes, but it looks ridiculous, like glorified ping-pong. If I wanted to play ping-pong, I would -- well, if I wanted to play ping-pong, I would k*ll myself.
RICHARD: Well, I hope you're still good with a racket, Christopher. Lorelei was always hopeless. As a child, we took her to an ophthalmologist to test her depth perception. He could find no rational reason for it.
CHRISTOPHER: [Ignoring Richard and speaking to Lorelai.] I know I'm not Sherry.
EMILY: I'm sorry. Did he serve you Sherry? Richard there has been some mistake, Christopher's drink was supposed to be port.
CHRISTOPHER: [To Lorelai] Come to Paris with me.
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: You were right. I should take Gigi myself, check everything out.
EMILY: Check what out?
RICHARD: Paris. I think they want to check out Paris.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on. You can't say "no." I mean, you can, but don't, and maybe there's even a Parisian ice hotel we can stay in.
LORELAI: Yes. I mean, no, there is no ice hotel. But I'll stay in one made of stone or bricks or whatever Paris hotels are made of.
CHRISTOPHER: We can blast the air-conditioning and drink all the vodka you want.
EMILY: What on earth…
LORELAI: Tat sounds great.
EMILY: What happened when you went to the powder room? One minute, we're sitting here having dessert. And the next, you're talking about Paris.
LORELAI: Well, Chris and I are going to Paris.
CHRISTOPHER: In just a couple of weeks, actually. I'm so sorry Emily we're gonna have to take a rain check on that tennis date.
LORELAI: Yeah, till the 12th of never 'cause we wouldn't play tennis or golf or bridge or any game that could be played in a foursome -- except hangman and sometimes Pictionary.
EMILY: What has gotten into you? You were being so pleasant.
LORELAI: Mmm, what is this? This looks good.
EMILY: "What is it"? I told you 20 minutes ago. It's Rhubarb pie.
LORELAI: Hmm. Is it still Rhubarb pie?
EMILY: I swear I was having the most wonderful time.
LORELAI: Is Rhubarb a root, dad?
RICHARD: No.
[Rory enters the room]
RORY: Hi, everyone.
LORELAI: Honey!
RORY: Hello.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey.
RORY: Am I late?
EMILY: Of course not, Rory.
LORELAI: You're just in time for Rooty Rhubarb pie, and for the viewing of mom's mug sh*t.
EMILY: Rory, stop her.
RORY: I'm sure you look very nice, grandma.
CHRISTOPHER: You are very photogenic, Emily.
LORELAI: Ooh! What am I saying? I have pictures on my phone. Gather 'round the phone, everybody.
[Richard gets up]
EMILY: Richard, what are you doing? Oh, nothing. Nothing. Oh! [Chuckles] These new phones are amazing.
RORY: Are those handcuffs? Grandma, are you wearing handcuffs?
EMILY: I certainly was not.
CHRISTOPHER: No they gave her one of those ankle things with like a chain and cannonball on the end.
EMILY: Christopher!
LORELAI: Oh and the stripy outfit, tell Rory how they made you wear the stripy outfit, mom.
[Laughs]
RICHARD: Oh!
CHRISTOPHER'S CAR
[Chris finds some music, Jewel "Who Will Save Your Soul"]
LORELAI: No.
[Changes the music, Slade "Come On feel The Noize"]
RORY: No.
[Changes it again.]
LORELAI & RORY: No!
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles]
[Changes it again, Jay and the Americans "Come a Little Bit Closer"]
LORELAI & RORY: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
LORELAI: Stop there!
[Lorelai looks happy, as does Chris and Rory, As the enter Stars Hollow they all smell the pickles again "Ugh. [Coughs]"]

LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai is sitting on the couch, she has called Emily, who is at home]
EMILY: Hello? Gilmore residence.
LORELAI: Hey, mom, it's me. I just wanted to leave you a message letting you know that unfortunately I will not be able to come by tonight to take a look at your new curtains.
EMILY: Lorelai, it's me.
LORELAI: So, sorry I missed you, but…
EMILY: You didn't miss me. For heaven's sakes, I'm right here.
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: Hello? Lorelai?
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: Hello?
LORELAI: Huh. That's weird. I don't know if your machine just cut me off.
EMILY: [Shaking the cordless phone] Is something wrong with this phone?
LORELAI: Anyway, uh, something came up, and I just have to take a rain check on the curtain check. I'm sure they're beautiful. No one knows how to pick out curtains like you. You're the curtain queen.
[Meanwhile Emily was also talking "Rain check, Lorelai I'm right here, I'm on the phone, Lorelai"]
EMILY: Hello? Lorelai, can you hear me?
LORELAI: Anyway, have a good night, curtain queen. Give my best to dad. Bye.
EMILY: Lorelai? Hello? Hello?
LORELAI: [Too Chris as he puts his arm around her] See? I told you it would work.
CHRISTOPHER: Wow. How did you even think to…
LORELAI: Well, it's natural instincts honed by years of experience.
CHRISTOPHER: Wow.
LORELAI: Yeah. Fight or flight, you know. Fight or flight and I just did my nails, so...
CHRISTOPHER & LORELAI: Flight.
[They Kiss]
CHRISTOPHER: Wow.
[The phone ring and Lorelai tosses it aside on the couch.]
OPENING CREDITS
LORELAI'S HOUSE – KITCHEN
[Lorelai is at the table listening to a French lesions on audio tape]
MAN ON TAPE: Ou est la station de métro le plus proche? [French accent] "Where is the nearest subway station?"
LORELAI: Yeah.
MAN ON TAPE: Ou est-ce que je peux acheter un billet? [French accent] "Where can I buy a ticket?"
[Lorelai turns off the tape quickly as Chris enters]
CHRISTOPHER: The hunter and gatherer has returned.
LORELAI: Hey. Listen to how good I've gotten.
MAN ON TAPE: Pouvez-vous me donner un plan de métro, s'il vous plat? [French accent] "Could I have a map of the subway, please?"
LORELAI: [French accent] Could I have a map of the subway, please?
CHRISTOPHER: Impressive.
LORELAI: [Normal voice] Right? I'm practically fluent. [French accent] Thank you for the coffee and croissant.
CHRISTOPHER: De rien. "You're welcome."
LORELAI: [Chuckles] Duh.
CHRISTOPHER: I thought our stomachs should start adjusting to French cuisine, so I got croissants and café au lait.
LORELAI: I thought café au lait was Spanish.
CHRISTOPHER: No, it's French for "coffee and milk." "Lait" is "milk."
LORELAI: Really, I thought it was "café olé," like, "coffee! All right!"
CHRISTOPHER: You're kidding. You're not kidding. You are. You're kidding. I can't tell whether you're kidding.
LORELAI: I'm a woman of mystery.
CHRISTOPHER: You might want to try repeating those words in French.
LORELAI: No…
CHRISTOPHER: We leave for Paris in two weeks.
LORELAI: Yes but I don't have to actually speak French. I just have to sound French. That way if the Parisians find me just another uncouth American, I can tell them my sad story. [French accent] "I was born in Marseille, "and my parents were k*ll in a trs tragique accident. "And so I was sent to the states "and adopted by the evil Gilmore's, "who refused to let me speak French, but I never forgot the accent of my mother country."
CHRISTOPHER: That's a complicated back story.
LORELAI: [Normal voice] I've led a complicated life.
CHRISTOPHER: Somebody gets a lot of mail.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, I'm a popular gal. Also, my system is, I only open my mail once a month.
CHRISTOPHER: Your system is to open your mail once a month?
LORELAI: 12 times a year, you know, because if you open your mail more than that, you get a lot of mattress fliers and bills and another bill. This way, I open it once a month, and I get letters from people who still write letters and shampoo samples and fun stuff. It's fun.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, what's this?
LORELAI: Um, something from Yale?
CHRISTOPHER: About the parents' weekend. We should go.
LORELAI: Nah.
CHRISTOPHER: Why no?
LORELAI: I'm sure it already happened.
CHRISTOPHER: No, it's happening this weekend. Come on. Could be fun.
LORELAI: I got to wash my hair. [Holds up the free shampoo sample]
CHRISTOPHER: Why don't you want to go?
LORELAI: Because, my hair.
CHRISTOPHER: Looks great when it's dirty. The oil gives it a kind of sheen a gloss.
LORELAI: Parents' weekend is for lame-o parents whose kids hate them, so they need a school-sanctioned event so they all spend time together.
CHRISTOPHER: [Reading the flyer] A professor of geology is giving a tour of the Peabody museum.
LORELAI: My kid likes me. I can go to Yale any time I want. 51 weekends of the year is my parents' weekend.
CHRISTOPHER: "The Gemstones of Yale." How cool does that sound?
LORELAI: On a scale of 1 to 2? Listen, parents' weekend is not an accurate portrait of the school, anyway. They make special food. They gussy the place up. They plant kids under trees reading Tolstoy, so it all looks very collegiate and idyllic.
CHRISTOPHER: There's a brunch at Branford with the provost.
LORELAI: I've always loved the word "provost." Although I have no idea what a provost is, it just sounds so...
CHRISTOPHER: Idyllic and collegiate?
LORELAI: Yes or something from a deli counter. "Extra provost on that, please." Do you really want to go?
CHRISTOPHER: It's parents' weekend, we're Rory's parents, and we're together, and why not? Come on, I'll help you shampoo your hair the night before.
LORELAI: All right. But I have to work on Sunday, so we'll have to go Saturday, and you'll have to give me a nice head massage when you wash my hair. With shampoo samples. And blow it out.
CHRISTOPHER: Done.
LORELAI: And braid it.
CHRISTOPHER: I'll French-braid it.
[Telephone rings]
LORELAI: Ooh la la. Hello?
RORY: Mom?
[Who is walking at Yale]
LORELAI: Bonjour, Rory.
RORY: Well, if it isn't the orphan from Marseille.
LORELAI: C'est moi. What are you doing?
RORY: Heading to class.
LORELAI: Class?
RORY: Yes, class, where they teach you all the college learnin'.
LORELAI: You're a senior. I thought no seniors went to class before noon. Nerd alert! Nerd alert!
RORY: Says the woman saying "nerd alert!"
LORELAI: Hey guess who's coming to parents' weekend.
RORY: Bunch of lame parents whose kids hate 'em.
LORELAI: Yes, and your parents.
RORY: No way.
LORELAI: I got to keep you on your toes. When you think I'll zig, I'll zag. Then when you think I'm gonna zag, I do zag, just to mess you up for the next time, when I might zig.
RORY: Dad's making you zag?
LORELAI: He's dying to meet the provost.
RORY: Well, who isn't?
CHRISTOPHER: [Taking the phone] It's your mom who's all about the provost. I just wanted to see you and check it out. And I wouldn't mind seeing the gemstones of Yale.
[Lorelai makes a funny face]
RORY: The huh?
CHRISTOPHER: The gemstones, the Yale gemstones.
RORY: Oh, right.
CHRISTOPHER: So is it cool if we come? It's only for Saturday.
RORY: Yeah it would be great, I mean Saturday's gonna be pretty busy for me 'cause we have to put out a parents' weekend edition of the paper, but I could definitely do lunch.
CHRISTOPHER: She can do lunch.
LORELAI: All right then we'll do lunch. I'll have extra provost with mine. [Takes the phone back] Hey after lunch, can we walk hunky Dan?
RORY: Handsome Dan?
LORELAI: That's his official mascot name. "Hunky Dan" is what I call him when we're alone.
RORY: Mom, I got to go.
LORELAI: You know who'd make a great mascot? Paul Anka.
RORY: Mum.
LORELAI: I'm not sure he's the ivy league type, though. He might need more of a hacky-sacking, poetry-reading, tie-dyeing kind of place…
RORY: Mum.
LORELAI: Like reed or Oberlin, where the air is sweet with the scent of patchouli.
RORY: Mum. I'm not missing the beginning of this lecture.
LORELAI: Nerd alert! Nerd alert! Nerd alert! [Hangs up the phone and smiles at Chris]
LUKE'S DINER
KIRK: What kind of sandwich is that, Luke?
LUKE: Ham and cheese.
KIRK: Is it stinky cheese?
LUKE: Cheddar.
KIRK: Because you really don't want to pack April a lunch with stinky cheese. By lunchtime, the whole bag will smell, and people won't believe it's just the cheese. They'll think it's her. They'll think she's stinky.
LUKE: Eat your breakfast, Kirk.
LULU: Muffin?
KIRK: Yes, muffin?
LULU: No, I'm offering.
KIRK: Is it bran?
LULU: It's banana.
KIRK: It could be banana-bran.
LULU: It's just banana.
KIRK: Okay.
LULU: Butter?
KIRK: Not too much.
LULU: 1 1/2 pats.
KIRK: Two pats is too much.
LULU: 1 1/2.
LUKE: April, your ride's here.
APRIL: I'm coming! [Comes down from the apartment]
LUKE: Got everything?
APRIL: Yeah.
LUKE: Protractor?
APRIL: I got it.
LUKE: Biology homework?
APRIL: Yep.
LUKE: Extra sweater?
APRIL: I still got the green cardigan in my locker.
LUKE: Good, good.
APRIL: Bye, dad.
LUKE: Wait what about your swimsuit?
APRIL: I got it.
LUKE: You sure you don't need a ride to swim practice?
APRIL: Megan's mom is taking me. I told you.
[The ride starts honking the horn]
LUKE: She's coming! All right, so, look -- I'll pick you up at 5:00, and I'll be there right after work.
[Horn honks]
APRIL: Okay
LUKE: All right, already! She's standing right here! Go.
APRIL: All right. Bye.
LUKE: Yeesh!
LULU: I should go, too. Have a good day, baby.
KIRK: You too.
LULU: Bye, Luke.
LUKE: Bye, Lulu.
KIRK: [He watches as Lulu leaves, and then sighs] Could someone crack a window? Because I am suffocating.
LUKE: What?
KIRK: Tell me you didn't see that.
LUKE: See what, Kirk?
KIRK: Lulu! She's smothering me!
LUKE: Smothering you?
KIRK: Everywhere I go, there she is. I'm sitting at the movies. Who's sitting next to me? Lulu. I go out to dinner. Who's sitting across from me? Lulu. I'm hanging out on the couch, watching TV. Who's right there next to me?
LUKE: Your mother.
KIRK: And Lulu. And at least mother respects my personal space. Sometimes when you're watching "Antiques Roadshow," you just don't want somebody tickling your arm.
[Out side the ride for April quickly backs up, April gets out and runs into the diner to get the packet lunch she forgot on the counter]
APRIL: [Chuckles] Bye again.
[Luke smiles as he watched April leave again]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Michel and Sookie enter the kitchen, Lorelai is getting some coffee]
MICHEL: You're pitiful.
SOOKIE: I'm just telling you how it is.
MICHEL: You don't tell me how it is. I tell you how it is.
SOOKIE: No, you don't.
MICHEL: Yes, I do.
SOOKIE: You think you do. But you don't that's what I'm trying to tell you.
MICHEL: [Chuckles] You're telling me that you tell me how it is?
SOOKIE: That's what I'm telling you.
MICHEL: We'll just see about that. Lorelai?
LORELAI: Busy.
MICHEL: We have a question.
LORELAI: Busy, busy bee.
MICHEL: Sookie's under the mistaken impression that she will be in charge of the front desk while you are in Paris. I informed her that that job falls to me. Could you please clear this up for her?
LORELAI: Did I not mention how busy I am? Busy, like a bee. Bzzz!
MICHEL: Lorelai!
LORELAI: [Sighs] Michel, while I am away, you're in charge of the front desk.
MICHEL: Ha!
LORELAI: However, Sookie is a co-owner of the inn, so she is in charge in charge.
SOOKIE: Ha ha!
MICHEL: That is preposterous. She does not know the first thing about running the front desk.
SOOKIE: All I have to know is how to tell your sorry behind to stand at the front desk and be courteous and to check those nice people in and out. [Imitates whip crack]
LORELAI: Sorry.
MICHEL: Absurd. [Then leaves[
SOOKIE: That's right, back to your station! [Imitates whip crack again]
LORELAI: Really was that really necessary?
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: To provoke him like that. You know how sensitive he is.
SOOKIE: Well, I'm sorry. He's been driving me crazy. He keeps referring to himself as my supervisor and insisting that I call him "captain."
LORELAI: Well now I have to deal all day with sulky, pouty Michel.
SOOKIE: He's a big baby. He should come to work wearing a diaper and caring a rattle.
LORELAI: Maybe while I'm gone, you can get him to do that. [Imitates whip crack and then leaves]
[Knock on kitchen outside door]
HARVEY: Hello?
SOOKIE: Hi.
HARVEY: Are you Sookie St. James?
SOOKIE: That's me.
HARVEY: I'm Harvey Tuttle. I just took over the Tillman farm.
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah. Congratulations. Beautiful property.
HARVEY: Thank you. I still can't quite believe it's all mine. [they laugh] Anyhow, this is my first crop, and I'm just offering free samples to all the local restaurants. Got some eggplant, zucchini, some tomatoes here.
SOOKIE: Oh, thank you, but I already have a vegetable supplier.
HARVEY: Well, you know, technically, tomatoes are a fruit.
SOOKIE: Ah. Fair point. Well, I have a vegetable and fruit supplier.
HARVEY: How about legumes?
SOOKIE: And legumes.
HARVEY: That's okay why don't you go ahead and take this batch anyway?
SOOKIE: Oh, no, no, no.
HARVEY: On the house on the house. And If you like it and feel like passing my name along, I'd greatly appreciate it.
SOOKIE: Okay. I will do that.
HARVEY: Thank you. It was nice meeting you, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Nice to meet you, too. [Smells a some of the vegetables] Ooh.
SWIMMING POOL
[Luke arrives to pick up April]
SUSAN: Come on! Everybody should be in the locker room! Allison, Haley, no running.
LAURA: My towel's all wet.
SUSAN: That's what happens when you throw it in the pool, Laura. It's a terrific lesson in cause and effect. Now, squeeze it out and go get changed. [Taking some equipment from a girl] Thank you. [Turns around to see Luke] Hi, there.
LUKE: Hi. I'm Luke Danes.
SUSAN: April's dad. She talks a lot about you.
LUKE: Yeah, you must be coach Bennett.
SUSAN: Susan.
LUKE: Yeah.
SUSAN: Nice to meet you.
LUKE: Yeah. You too.
SUSAN: April's in the locker room. She should be right out.
LUKE: Okay.
SUSAN: She's doing really great, definitely one of our most enthusiastic swimmers.
LUKE: Yeah, she really seems to love it.
SUSAN: Good natural technique. Does she get that from you?
LUKE: Oh, no, not me. No I don't really know how to swim.
SUSAN: Seriously?
LUKE: Yeah. I mean, I could doggy-paddle to shore in a pinch, but I never really learned formally.
SUSAN: Luke, that's not good.
LUKE: I'm pretty good on land.
SUSAN: You need to be certified. You take April to pools, lakes, the ocean.
LUKE: I never really thought about that.
SUSAN: No worries, I teach an adult swim class Saturday mornings for an hour and half. It's an 8-week course. In fact I just started new round of classes last week, so if you came this Saturday, you'll really not have missed much at all.
LUKE: Oh, I-I don't know.
SUSAN: Luke, this is not something I would wait on.
LUKE: Well, I -- yeah, okay. I guess I could do that.
SUSAN: Great.
APRIL: Oh. Hey, dad.
LUKE: Hey.
APRIL: Oh, this is coach Bennett.
LUKE: Yeah, we were just meeting.
APRIL: Well did she tell you I'm gonna swim the 100-meter butterfly and the 4x100-meter freestyle at our meet next week?
LUKE: No, but that's great!
APRIL: I mean I'm not anchor or anything, but I'm still pretty fast.
SUSAN: And getting faster all the time. And hey your dad's gonna take a swim class with me.
APRIL: [Laughs] Really? You are?
LUKE: Well, yeah.
APRIL: Do you even own a bathing suit?
LUKE: Yeah, I do. It's not a Speedo or anything.
APRIL: [Laughter] That is the funniest thing I have ever, can we call mom and tell her from the car?
LUKE: Yeah.
YALE - EXTERIOR
LORELAI: Grass is just not this green -- not outside of "Pleasantville," it isn't.
CHRISTOPHER: So, what exactly are you saying?
LORELAI: I'm suggesting they brought in sod.
CHRISTOPHER: You suspect sod.
LORELAI: Yes yes, or spray paint. Maybe they spray-painted the grass when they spray-painted these trees 'cause I mean there's autumnal foliage and then there's autumnal foliage. It's over the top, people.
CHRISTOPHER: You're onto them. Hey, you think Yale piped in this crisp fall smell?
LORELAI: Uh, yeah, because Yale is crafty, Yale is smart. Yale is Yale, after all.
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: Have fun, you two! Go, bulldogs!
CHRISTOPHER: Hello.
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: Hi.
LORELAI: Let me ask you something. Do you really go here, or are you an actress hired by Yale?
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: [Very perky] What? I go here. I go here.
LORELAI: You're good. I almost believe you.
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: I'm sorry?
CHRISTOPHER: Hi. We're Rory Gilmore's parents.
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: Well, Rory Gilmore's parents, welcome to parents' weekend. Here's a parents' packet.
LORELAI: Fabulous.
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: Inside, you should find a map of the campus. You are here.
LORELAI: So we are.
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: A schedule of the weekend's events and a nametag.
LORELAI: Thanks. Great. Go, bulldogs.
SMILEY STUDENT VOLUNTEER: I was just gonna say that. Have fun, you two.
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.
LORELAI: Hey, let's be Laverne and Shirley.
CHRISTOPHER: What? No.
LORELAI: Antony and Cleopatra? F. Scott and Zelda? Zinf and Del?
CHRISTOPHER: I think I'll stick with my own name.
LORELAI: Senior boring pants? Mr stick in the mud? [Reading the schedule] "A cappella," "a cappella." Hmm-hmm. There's a terrifying number of a-cappella jams this weekend.
CHRISTOPHER: What exactly is an a-cappella jam?
LORELAI: [Cell phone rings] I don't know, but it sure sounds painful. [Answering the phone] Hey. We're here.
RORY: Hey [To A.K.] See if you can get that editorial to fit on one page. [Back to Lorelai] So, you're here.
LORELAI: With bells on, and nothing else, except leg warmers, roller skates, and Groucho Marx glasses.
RORY: How classy.
CHRISTOPHER: [To the phone] Hi, Rory!
LORELAI: Well, we're your parents. We're supposed to embarrass you. Are you at the paper?
RORY: Yes, I am, indeed. Where are you guys?
LORELAI: We are near a big brick building and a big tree. Are you near there?
RORY: Possibly, we have a lot of brick buildings and old trees here at Yale.
CHRISTOPHER: Tell her we're by the L-shaped building that from the top looks like a Polaroid camera.
RORY: Believe it or not, I don't know what Yale's buildings look like from the sky.
LORELAI: How ignorant of you, honey. [To Chris] Rory says she doesn't give two figs about Yale architecture.
CHRISTOPHER: [Taking the phone] Not two figs?
RORY: 1 1/2 figs is all I'll give.
CHRISTOPHER: How are things at the paper?
RORY: Busy but good. I should be done by lunch.
CHRISTOPHER: Cool, so we got this schedule of events. Any recommendations?
LORELAI: [Shouting to the phone] Brunch with the provost!
CHRISTOPHER: I might like to tour the Peabody or maybe catch one of the faculty lectures, there's one called "plagues and pleasures" with professor summers.
RORY: Summers is good. He's a bigwig in the world of molecular biophysics.
CHRISTOPHER: Sounds hard.
RORY: Will I doubt there'll be an exam.
CHRISTOPHER: How about "the extravagant universe" with professor Quincy?
LORELAI: Aw God [takes the phone from Chris] Hey, what is with all the a cappella? There's a cappella, a cappella, morning, noon, and night. I'm not sure I can take that much a cappella.
RORY: Then you should avoid arches. A-cappella groups tend to hang out under arches, arches and any other places with good acoustics.
LORELAI: Thanks for the tip.
RORY: And if you hear a pitch pipe, run. I got to get back to work.
LORELAI: Okay, we're gonna have brunch with the provost... or on the provost -- it's still unclear.
RORY: Bye, mom.
LORELAI: Bye. [To Chris] Hey. What is with your nametag?
CHRISTOPHER: What do you mean?
LORELAI: It's in the middle of your chest.
CHRISTOPHER: So.
LORELAI: So you're supposed to wear it off to the side. Who wears a nametag in the middle of their chest?
CHRISTOPHER: Superman.
LORELAI: Superman's "S" that was not a nametag. That was an emblem.
CHRISTOPHER: So, this is my emblem.
LORELAI: "Hello, I'm Rory Gilmore's dad, Christopher" is your emblem?
CHRISTOPHER: Yes, it is.
LORELAI: I'm gonna have to ask you to walk 15 feet in front of me.
SWIMMING POOL
[Luke and 6 other adults are in the pool with Susan.]
SUSAN: And breathe in. And blow. And breathe in. And blow. Good, Luke. But try not to take such shallow breaths. [Touching him on the chest] Try to take slower, deeper breaths from your diaphragm. Feel that?
LUKE: Yeah.
RONALD: I'm having a little trouble getting deep breaths over here.
SUSAN: You're doing fine, Ronald. [To Luke] Now you stopped breathing altogether.
LUKE: [Coughs]
SUSAN: Just try and relax.
LUKE: Okay. [Still getting his breath]
SUSAN: It's okay. You'll get the hang of it.
LUKE: [Breathless] yeah.
SUSAN: Okay, everybody. That's it. Good work. [To Luke] You did good today.
LUKE: Yeah? Thanks.
SUSAN: Yeah. You caught right up. I'll have you swimming like a fish in no time.
LUKE: Oh, good. Thank you.
SUSAN: So...you eat?
LUKE: Eat?
SUSAN: Food. I was thinking you could call me, and we could get a bite to eat.
LUKE: Uh, yeah, sure, sure.
SUSAN: Here. Here's the young dolphins' contact sheet. My number's right at the top.
LUKE: Okay. Great. Thanks.
SUSAN: See you soon.
LUKE: Bye.
YALE - CAFETERIA
LORELAI: Look at this propaganda. Belgian waffles, cloth napkins. I've had breakfast here before, and it was paper napkins and American cereal all the way. Yeah -- lox, capers, itty-bitty bagels? Pack of lies.
LOU: Coffee?
LORELAI: Uh, coffee.
CHRISTOPHER: Coffee.
LOU: I'm Lou, Ethan Morton's dad.
LORELAI: Cheers.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm Christopher. This is Lorelai. We're Rory Gilmore's parents.
LOU: Rory Gilmore? Sure she's a senior, right?
LORELAI: Wow. Did you memorize the student face book?
LOU: [Chuckles] The masthead of the Yale daily news. Ethan's an aspiring journalist and a big fan of your daughter's.
LORELAI: I love that Rory has fans.
LOU: Maybe we should set up a lunch so Rory could meet Ethan.
DAISY: Lou, honestly. I apologize on behalf of my husband, who can't seem to remember that Ethan already got into Yale. The pressure's off. He doesn't need his booster club anymore. Daisy.
LORELAI: Hi. Lorelai and Christopher. We're Rory Gilmore's parents.
DAISY: Oh, Rory Gilmore's parents. [To Lou] Oh! Where did you get the darling little bagels?
LORELAI: Oh, they're right over here. I'll show you.
DAISY: Oh…[Follows Lorelai] You know Ethan really is an incredible journalist. He wrote this editorial for his high-school paper arguing that it should be legal to burn the American flag. Insightful as hell. I'd be glad to e-mail you a copy, if you want.
LORELAI: [Sounding like she's not interested] Where is the provost? Aren't you dying to meet the provost?
LOU: Sorry if I was being a bit pushy.
CHRISTOPHER: No. Please. You're a proud dad.
LOU: Yeah and we should be proud, right? Our kids done good.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckling] Yeah.
LOU: It's just hard to let go, you know, after all those years of looking over their homework and reading their papers, practicing lines with them for the school play, taking them to karate lessons, violin lessons, S.A.T.-Prep courses.
[Chris looks on agreeing but feeling like he missed out.]
JAKE: What about 5:00 A.M. Hockey practice?
LOU: Science projects.
JAKE: I helped owen build a wave generator one year. $3,200. That's what it cost me to replace the kitchen tiles when the thing exploded in the middle of the night.
CHRISTOPHER: It exploded?
JAKE: I sell ladies' shoes. What do I know about wave generators? Jake -- Owen Huber's dad.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm Christopher. I'm...
JAKE: Rory Gilmore's dad. I was just talking to your wife.
LORELAI: Um, actually, I'm not his wife.
JAKE: I didn't say you were I was talking about his wife -- Mrs. Gilmore. She's over there by the Mimosas.
[Looks over to see Emily laughter with some other ladies]
LORELAI: Unbelievable. I'm sorry. Will you excuse me? I'm gonna go talk to Mrs. Gilmore.
LOU: Which lectures are you guys gonna hit?
[Lorelai comes up to Emily]
EMILY: And I said to him, "they've tenured Bill Sunderland? Who's next -- Carmen Electra?" [Laughter]
LORELAI: Good one, mom.
EMILY: Lorelai. If you'll excuse us? Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hi.
EMILY: Well. My goodness. What on earth are you doing here?
LORELAI: What am I doing here? Well I think the question is, what are you doing here?
EMILY: It's Yale parents' weekend.
LORELAI: Yes, but you are not a parent.
EMILY: I still can't believe you're here.
LORELAI: Mother, it's parents' weekend. I'm a parent that's why I'm here. I'm a parent.
EMILY: And I'm a grandparent.
LORELAI: Right a grandparent, not a parent.
EMILY: A grandparent is a type of parent.
LORELAI: No, it's not.
EMILY: A grand piano is a type of piano, is it not?
LORELAI: Well you got me there, Riddler, but I hope that logic works when I crash grandparents' weekend.
EMILY: Oh, please, Lorelai. Your father and I have been attending Rory's parents' weekends here at Yale since her freshman year. It's one of our little traditions. Hello, Rachel. I'll see you at the field-hockey game?
LORELAI: It's one of your little traditions to pretend to be Rory's parents?
RICHARD: Lorelai. [As he comes up] What a surprise.
LORELAI: Yes it is a surprise. You know why you guys aren't parents. Why are you here?
RICHARD: I'm an alumnus, Lorelai. Also a visiting faculty member.
EMILY: And you'll remember, until recently, your father and I were the ones taking responsibility for Rory's tuition.
LORELAI: Yes, I remember.
EMILY: We felt someone ought to attend, for Rory's sake. It's obviously not your kind of thing.
LORELAI: What is that supposed to mean?
RICHARD: Well, I'm glad you're here.
LORELAI: Thank you, me too. What's that supposed to mean?
EMILY: You don't like these kinds of things -- things with schedules and nametags. You mock these kinds of things.
LORELAI: Well I'm here I'm not mocking. I'm brunching.
RICHARD: I think you'll find parents' weekend great fun.
LORELAI: Thank you. It is. I am -- finding it great fun.
RICHARD: We always tour the campus, check in here at Branford, maybe take in a faculty lecture or two, and then take Rory out to dinner.
LORELAI: You're taking Rory to dinner?
EMILY: We're going to Chez Zinjustin this year, a fabulous French restaurant. They have a Crme Brlée that is to die for.
LORELAI: Well, that sounds like fun. Too bad you're gonna miss the tour of the gemstones of Yale.
RICHARD: The tour at Peabody? I thought that was much earlier.
LORELAI: Yes, well, it is -- for the general public. We signed up for a special evening one. Chris and I signed up weeks ago.
EMILY: Christopher's here?
LORELAI: Yes ‘cause he's a parent. It's his weekend, too. So, we'll go to the tour and then probably hit a few panels, go to the, em…
EMILY: What is this you have on your nametag -- "Zinf"? What is "Zinf"? Some kind of joke?
LORELAI: Oh, it's an old, traditional Yale word...thingy.
RICHARD: What is that word -- "Zinf"? Is it Hebrew?
EMILY: Why is it on your nametag?
LORELAI: You guys don't know? I thought you were all into Yale.
CHRISTOPHER: Hello, Emily. Richard.
RICHARD: [Shacks hands] Christopher. Nice to see you.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey Lor, professor Quincy's talk is about to start, and I know you probably don't…
LORELAI: don't want to miss a word. Yes, that's true. Well, we've got to go. You enjoy your evening. Astrophysics waits for no man.



LECTURE HALL
[The lecture is underway]
PROFESSOR QUINCY: When supernovae explode, they emit an energy that is 4 billion times greater than the sun. So powerful are these explosions that even though they're occurring halfway across the observable universe, some 7 billion light-years away...
[Chris is trying to listen]
LORELAI: My parents have got a lot of nerve, you know? That's one thing they've got, is nerve. They should put it to good use -- start a knife-throwing contest or something.
CHRISTOPHER: Lor...
LORELAI: [Sighs] I mean, lunch? Please. They get dinner, and we get lunch? Lunch is such a booby prize.
PROFESSOR QUINCY: ...We would be able to see that the expansion of the universe was slowing down.
LORELAI: I just can't believe Rory didn't tell us that they were coming. You know. Berate her. [Texting on her phone] "Rory... you...little...rat."
PROFESSOR QUINCY: But we've learned that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down -- it's speeding up.
LORELAI: She says that she assumed that we knew they were coming. [Texting again] "When you assume, you make an…"
CHRISTOPHER: shh!
PROFESSOR QUINCY: Something else is happening in the universe that is counteracting the powerful force of gravity, and that's what we call "dark energy."
LORELAI: Hey, you know what? We should have lunch at Chez Zinjustin. I hear they have a Crme Brlée to die for.
CHRISTOPHER: Sure. Sounds good.
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: You can't make a phone call in here.
LORELAI: I want to make sure we get a reservation.
PROFESSOR QUINCY:...Back in the 1930s. So, it may be that Einstein was right all along. Turns out the guy was pretty smart. [Laughter and applause] All right, are there any questions? Yes?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, how can we tell whether dark energy is the same thing as the cosmological constant?
[Looking proud]
PROFESSOR QUINCY: Excellent question. More thorough measurement from observatories on the ground, from the Hubble space telescope...
DRAGONFLY INN – KITCHEN
SOOKIE: I was making Ratatouille anyway.
MICHEL: Excuse me?
SOOKIE: Perfectly good vegetables, and I was making Ratatouille anyway, and no sense in wasting them.
MICHEL: Did I miss something?
SOOKIE: Not like there's anything to feel guilty about. Jackson sells his vegetables all over town. I'm not just gonna throw these away.
MICHEL: Just because Lorelai is away does not mean that I'm obligated to listen to your incessant prattling.
SOOKIE: I mean, it would be wrong to waste vegetables. Wasting vegetables is wrong.
MICHEL: I will listen to you on one condition. Call me "captain."
SOOKIE: No.
MICHEL: Fine. [Starts to leave]
SOOKIE: Okay...captain.
MICHEL: Yes?
SOOKIE: The point is that Jackson's vegetables are top-of-the-line, first-rate. But they're his vegetables, you know, and these aren't. These have something different to offer, and I shouldn't feel guilty about…
MICHEL: You know what? It's not worth it. [Leaves]
SOOKIE: [Too other kitchen staff] It's just Ratatouille, okay? Nothing to get all riled up about.
LUKE'S DINER
LUKE: Caesar, I'm back.
KIRK: Hey, Luke, you want to grab a cold one tonight, bird-dog some Chicas?
LUKE: What?
KIRK: As of 0700 this evening, I'm going to be a free man.
LUKE: You are?
KIRK: I am. Giving Lulu the old heave-ho, hitting the eject button.
LUKE: Kirk?
KIRK: I owe it all to you, buddy.
LUKE: Me?
KIRK: You inspired me. I look at you, and I think, "this guy's doing it right. Slave to no master." You come home at 3:00 in the morning -- no one cares. You want to eat dessert for dinner -- no one cares. You walk around in tube socks and tighty whities -- no one cares. No one cares what you do or where you go. [Luke is not looking happy] So, what do you say, Luke? You want to be my wingman, goose to my maverick? [Singing into a ladle] You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips and there's no tenderness…
LUKE: [Putting his arm around kirks neck] Listen, you pinhead, you should be kissing the ground that Lulu walks on. Why that sweet girl lets you within a hundred miles of her is beyond me, but she does. You are the luckiest man on the planet to have a girl like that looking out for you and caring about you. And if you say so much as one unkind word to her, I will personally break every bone in your body. You got me?
[Kirk is speechless, Luke takes the flyer out of his bag that Susan gave him and goes to the apartment.]
YALE NEWS ROOM
PARIS: What did you end up putting on the front page?
SHEILA: Don't play dumb, Paris.
PARIS: My early-admission/early-actions piece. No kidding.
RORY: It was a good article.
PARIS: [To Sheila] Huh, I'm hardly ever here anymore, I'm putting in minimal effort when I am here, and yet my article is still the front-page lead. It's almost too easy.
[Lorelai and Chris quietly enter and stay back to listen.]
RORY: It's not locked yet, Paris. Okay A.K., You're gonna take care of that Lacrosse caption?
A.K.: What was wrong with what I had?
RORY: Well you might want to save the metaphors and alliterations for poetry class and give me something short and snappy. And you might want to mention Lacrosse.
A.K.: You got it.
LORELAI: [Quietly to Chris] I love how bossy she is.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, she is their boss. Yeah, I love that. She's like a dictator, only cute and nonviolent. And instead of a country, she has a newspaper.
A.K.: "Yale Lacrosse team sticks it to Ivy League rivals"?
RORY: Done. Okay, so, A.K. Will take care of that. And good job, everybody. Layout is locked.
PARIS: [To Sheila] It's funny it's almost like I'd have to work harder not to get the front page.
RORY: Oh, hi, parents.
LORELAI: You are the cutest fascist ever.
RORY: Hi, so, how was the morning?
LORELAI: Brunch was lovely, except of course for my parents skulking around, which no one warned me about. Hey I forgot I'm still mad at you.
RORY: Don't be mad at me.
LORELAI: Okay fine but only 'cause you're the cutest despot ever.
RORY: What else?
CHRISTOPHER: We had a few close brushes with a cappella.
LORELAI: Aw, that was a narrow escape. We were taking a shortcut on the way to the lecture hall, and we almost shortcutted our way into a group of guys singing "Zombie Jamboree."
RORY: You guys went to a lecture?
LORELAI: Yes, where I learned that the universe is expanding and that your dad is a big question-asking geek. Hey, we have come to take you to lunch at Chez Zinjustin.
RORY: Wow. Fancy.
CHRISTOPHER: Apparently, the Crme Brlée is to die for.
RORY: Since when do you say "to die for"?
LORELAI: Since he got addicted to "project runway."
CHRISTOPHER: Make it work.
RORY: So you guys should meet everybody. Mom and dad, this is Sheila, Bill, A.K., Raj, and Joni. [They say Hi as a group] This is Christopher and Lorelai. And you know Paris, of course.
PARIS: Lorelai. It's been too long. [Kisses her on both cheeks]
LORELAI: Hi. Oh. Wow. Okay. And you know Christopher.
PARIS: I believe we've met in passing. Good to see you, Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: Good to see you.
RORY: We're just going to Chez Zinjustin for lunch.
BILL: You mean "chez fancy pants."
SHEILA: My dad took me, and my roommates there for dinner freshman year -- back when he still loved me. It's supernice.
RAJ: I hear they match your napkin to what you're wearing.
JONI: I hear they fold your napkin into an origami swan every time you leave the table.
RORY: I don't know about the napkins but I hear the Crme Brlée is to die for.
A.K.: I heard that to.
CHRISTOPHER: You know what? You should all come along.
BILL: Who, us?
CHRISTOPHER: Sure. Hey, let's bring the whole gang.
RORY: Oh, dad, you don't have to…
CHRISTOPHER: I want to it'll give me a chance to get to know all your friends.
RORY: People might have plans.
BILL: None.
PARIS: There's a shocker.
SHEILA: I'm starving.
LORELAI: Well, all right, then. Come on. Lunch on Rory's dad.
JONI: Thank you.
RAJ: All right.
BILL: Sweet. Cool.
CHEZ ZINJUSTIN
[Slow music plays, the "gang" is sitting at their table, Rory, Lorelai and Chris are together.]
LORELAI: [French accent] Ah, thank you. The wine is wonderful.
WAITER: [British accent] I'm so glad you're enjoying it.
LORELAI: [Normal voice] Hey, this is a French restaurant. Shouldn't all the servers be French?
WAITER: Je ne suis pas français, mais je peux parler français, si vous préférez. [I am not French, but I can speak French, if you prefer]
LORELAI: [French accent] Uh, where is the nearest subway station? Ha. [Chuckles]
WAITER: Another bottle, sir?
CHRISTOPHER: Absolutely. Anyway, the chalet in k*ll had this open floor plan, sort of the way Rory's apartment's laid out.
RAJ: I've never exactly seen Rory's apartment.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh yeah.
RAJ: We mostly just hang at the paper and -- mostly at the paper.
CHRISTOPHER: Anyway, I really want to rent a place at a ski resort this winter, maybe k*ll or sugarloaf.
RAJ: That sounds great.
CHRISTOPHER: You know you should come -- totally. We'll get all of Rory's friends together for a long weekend, ski, hang out. It will be a blast.
RAJ: A ski trip sounds awesome.
SHEILA: Who's going skiing?
CHRISTOPHER: You are -- this winter. Everyone's invited.
SHEILA: Right on!
LORELAI: [To Rory] You don't hang out with any of these people outside the paper, do you?
RORY: Not so much.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay. Who wants dessert?
BILL: I'd love a Crme Brlée. I've never had Crme Brlée.
RAJ: I could do with a cognac.
PARIS: I wouldn't say no to a Digestif.
JONI: Crme Brlée for me. And a cognac.
CHRISTOPHER: You know I think we'd like to get Crme Brlée and cognac all around.
LORELAI: [To Rory] Sorry.
RORY: Why sorry?
LORELAI: Sorry if this lunch is weird.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Rory...
RORY: Okay, this lunch is weird.
LORELAI: I feel like we're those lame-o parents of yore.
RORY: Dad is trying kind of hard.
LORELAI: Yeah, I think any minute, he's gonna start juggling plates.
RORY: And hanging spoons off his nose. Yeah, but it's sweet.
CHRISTOPHER: But seriously you guys whenever you guys get a 3-day weekend, you should totally come up.
RAJ: Can we rent skis there?
CHRISTOPHER: Sure, or I can lend you a pair. We'll have you jumping moguls down a black diamond, Raj.
RORY: I guess It's good that I experience a little bit of lame-o parenting. I mean after all It's part of the quintessential college experience, isn't it?
LORELAI: I guess.
RORY: And it's great that you got to meet the whole gang before our big ski vacation together. [Cell phones start ringing.] Uh-oh.
LORELAI: "Uh-oh" good or "uh-oh" bad? I guess there isn't really an "uh-oh" good, is there?
RORY: :Um listen up, guys. A bunch of students that were protesting the w*r took over president Stewart's office. It looks like we're gonna have to rework the whole edition.
RAJ: Why can't the news stop while we're eating?
SHEILA: I know it's so impolite.
JONI: I just got a text with a photo. Looks like they're wearing George Bush masks and...[turns the phone upside down] are those Condoleezza Rice masks?
PARIS: They make Condoleezza masks?
RORY: We've got to get on this everybody. Um so you guys, I'm sorry it looks like we have to…
LORELAI: It's okay go.
CHRISTOPHER: Duty calls.
RORY: Okay, Sheila, get Keith on the phone and see if you can get him down there. Actually get Samantha down there, too. I want so many photos of this thing I can make a flip book. Bill and A.K., Get back to the office so you can proof the stories. We're emailing it in. Everyone else, you're with me.
BILL: What about the Crme Brlée?
RAJ: And our cognac?
BILL: I have yet to taste the sweet nectar of Crme Blée.
RORY: This is going to be our front page.
PARIS: Front page? Really? I think the front page is fine as it is.
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: Come on we all know these rabble-rousers are just looking for attention, why indulge them?
RORY: Let's go.
BILL: I want to go. I want to report this story. I just want to do it after I eat my Crme Brlée. I mean, what if tonight I get hit by lightning and die a Crme-Brlée virgin?
SHEILA: A Crme-Brlée virgin?
RORY: [Getting mad] You know what this is enough. This is a major political protest. It's a big story, and it's going to go on our front page. Now get your drunk, Crme-Brlée-craving asses out of these chairs, and let's get to work, okay? Besides the lead, I'm going to need some color -- what's going on behind the masks that kind a thing. Joni, you want to take a crack at that?
JONI: I'm a little tipsy.
RORY: Is there anyone who's not a little tipsy? Thanks for lunch, dad.
JONI: Thank you.
RAJ: Lunch was great.
SHEILA: Great meeting you.
CHRISTOPHER: See you later.
[The waiters come up with 2 large trays]
LORELAI: Well, I hope you're hungry for some Crme Brlée.
LUKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
APRIL: Are you sure you want to Fianchetto that bishop so early?
LANE: I don't know it depends on what "Fianchetto" means.
APRIL: It means I'm gonna kick your butt if you make that move.
LANE: Well you're kicking my butt anyway, so I don't see how one Fianchetto is gonna make much of a difference. Besides, it sounds fancy you make it like I know what I'm doing.
APRIL: You're not very good.
LUKE: April.
APRIL: Sorry. I can be blunt.
LANE: Tell it like it is, sister. Besides, later tonight, when we boggle, which is what I was told we'd be playing tonight, it is your butt that is going to be kicked, because I've been studying my 7-letter words that sound made-up but aren't. "Palfrey" -- p-a-l-f-r-e-y. It's a saddle horse for a woman.
APRIL: Impressive.
LUKE: Okay, so, coach Bennett and I are gonna go out and have some dinner together and talk, and then I'll be home. Shouldn't be more than a couple hours. Just a dinner and some talking.
APRIL: It would be weird if it was a dinner with no talking.
LUKE: Sure.
APRIL: And you should probably call her "Susan" tonight, instead of "coach Bennett" -- I think she'd prefer that.
LUKE: Good tip.
LANE: We'll hang out until you get back.
LUKE: Okay so you got the number of the restaurant. I'm gonna have my cell phone on me, so if there are any problems, anything…
LANE: Thank you, Luke. Bye.
APRIL: Bye, dad.
LUKE: See you later.
APRIL: You okay?
LANE: I'm fine. Okay, now, it's your move, darlin', unless you'd rather discuss zymurgy -- z-y-m-u-r-g-y -- the branch of applied chemistry dealing with fermentation.
APRIL: All right, all right. We can play boggle.
LANE: Yes!
RESTAURANT
[Luke and Susan enter]
HOSTESS: Hello. Two? Okay, right this way. There you go. Your waitress will be right with you.
SUSAN: Thank you. [To Luke] Oh, no. Come sit with me.
LUKE: There?
SUSAN: Yeah. It's cozier.
LUKE: Oh. Okay.
SUSAN: I hate being so far away.
LUKE: [Chuckles, then clears his throat. Looks at the menu] Wow!
SUSAN: I know, right? It's my favorite restaurant. And you said you liked to eat healthy, so..
LUKE: Yeah. Huh. I've never eaten this healthy. So, "vegan" doesn't just mean "vegetarian."
SUSAN: No -- no animal products of any kind. No eggs, no milk, no cheese.
LUKE: Just soy everything.
SUSAN: Soy steak is scrumptious. I swear you totally can't tell the difference.
LUKE: Oh, I bet I can.
SUSAN: So, Luke, let me ask you a question.
LUKE: Okay.
SUSAN: Who would play you in the Luke Danes movie?
LUKE: Huh?
SUSAN: Alive or dead.
LUKE: Uh...I never really thought about that.
SUSAN: Take your time. Do you want to know mine?
LUKE: Sure.
SUSAN: [Laughs] Marlene Dietrich.
LUKE: Oh.
SUSAN: Right!
LUKE: I don't know who that is.
SUSAN: Sure you do.
LUKE: No, I don't.
SUSAN: Yes, you do. Think.
LUKE: I don't.
SUSAN: "Touch of Evil," um "The Lady is Willing," "Destry Rides Again." "Your husband would rather be cheated by me than married to you."
LUKE: Oh, yeah, sure.
SUSAN: My last boyfriend -- "the ex" -- he was always calling me [shouting] "Marlene!" Oh, you know what? I think you might know him. Bob McCullough, Laura's father?
LUKE: No, I don't think I do.
SUSAN: We lived together for four months, and then he just went totally psycho. [shouting] Psycho! [Luke looks shocked and a little scared] I swore I wasn't gonna date any more single dads after that, but here I am.
LUKE: [Chuckles nervously]
SUSAN: You hooked me.
LUKE: Hmm.
SUSAN: Well, you know what they say -- third time's a charm.
WAITRESS: Can I get anybody a drink?
LUKE: Yes, please.
YALE – NIGHT – EXTERIOR
[Lorelai and Chris are walking]
LORELAI: I heard a bone crack, several bones cracking. Crack, crack, crack -- it was like fireworks.
CHRISTOPHER: Rugby is a violent sport.
LORELAI: I guess the fact that an ambulance was parked by the side of the field before the game even started should've been my first clue.
CHRISTOPHER: They don't park ambulances next to tetherball matches.
[Cell phone rings]
LORELAI: I can't believe we lost. It was so violent. I guess they were just violenter. [Looking at text message] Uh, it's Rory. They're at the paper. They're still working.
CHRISTOPHER: Man!
LORELAI: Half of them are drunk or hung over. Joni passed out.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, jeez.
LORELAI: Looks like she's gonna be there all night.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, that's not good news.
LORELAI: Well, silver lining -- that means she won't get to have dinner with my parents. We got the only meal. We won parents' weekend, and we didn't even break any bones.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Some meal.
LORELAI: What's wrong?
CHRISTOPHER: Nothing. I just -- I...I screwed up.
LORELAI: What do you mean, you screwed up?
CHRISTOPHER: It's my fault that Rory's got to work all night.
LORELAI: What do you mean? You staged the student protest? You wore a Condi mask and manacled yourself to the president's door?
CHRISTOPHER: The big meal, ordering all that wine. Her staff's a mess. It's my fault.
LORELAI: Honey, if those kids are gonna be journalists, they have to learn to write drunk.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm trying to be Superdad or something.
LORELAI: Why?
CHRISTOPHER: I don't know.
LORELAI: Does it have to do with the nametag-in-the-middle- of-the-chest thing?
CHRISTOPHER: At the brunch, all the other dads were talking about how they took their kids to hockey practice and violin lessons and helped them study for the S.A.T.S, and I just stood there like a jerk, nodding my head like I'd done all those things.
LORELAI: Oh, honey.
CHRISTOPHER: I didn't do any of those things.
LORELAI: Well first of all, Rory didn't need someone to check her homework. She was a self-starter. Second of all, she wasn't interested in hockey. And third of all, you don't have to try to be Superdad.
CHRISTOPHER: I feel like I should be.
LORELAI: No. You can just relax, you know? Be yourself. Be the dad that you are -- Clark Kent dad, Christopher Hayden dad.
CHRISTOPHER: I guess.
LORELAI: Totally.
CHRISTOPHER: It's just -- it's too late. I mean, I've g Gigi., And that's great, but Rory -- Rory's grown up. I missed it.
LORELAI: You didn't miss it.
CHRISTOPHER: She's a senior in college, Lor.
LORELAI: We have years of hard parenting ahead. She is due for a quarter-life crisis. All those years of stability do not bode well. We're gonna have plenty to do.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah. And the best part is... we get to deal with it together.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Quarter-life crisis, huh?
LORELAI: [Giggles] I'm pretty sure she's gonna spin wildly out of control. We're gonna have to do an intervention, put her through rehab, give her a place to stay while she's divorcing the hell's angel…
[A Cappella group sings "It don't make a difference if we make it or not we've both got one another, and that's a lot for love, let's give it a sh*t wh-o-o-o-oa we're halfway there ohhh, ohhh we're livin' on a prayer"]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
FRED: Divine. The tomatoes are so fresh and meaty.
CARL: The eggplant is what puts it over the top. Perfect sweetness, your best ever.
SOOKIE: Well, I wouldn't say my best.
FRED: It is, a whole new level of flavor, like a vegetable symphony. What do you think, captain?
MICHEL: It's true. It even surpasses my mother's, and that woman made Ratatouille for a living. Well done, Sookie.
FRED: Brava, Maestra.
SOOKIE: It's just Ratatouille, okay? Now, go get back to work. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
JACKSON: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey!
JACKSON: You ready to go?
SOOKIE: Ready, Freddy!
JACKSON: Just dropped the kids off at the Bostics'. They made me take my shoes off again.
SOOKIE: They make everybody take off their shoes. I can't remember the last time I saw the Bostics in anything but socks.
JACKSON: But then they had the audacity to complain that my feet smell.
SOOKIE: They really complained?
JACKSON: Well they made sour faces when I wasn't looking and rolled their eyes.
SOOKIE: Oh, Jackson.
JACKSON: What do they expect? Of course my feet smell. I work in the fields all day. That's why I wear big thick boots -- to contain the smell. I swear, the next time they come over to the house, I'm gonna ask them to take off their pants or something. It's outrageous!
SOOKIE: I'm sorry, honey.
JACKSON: Yeah, well...
SOOKIE: I know the Bostic's are a little nutso.
JACKSON: Very nutso. Who irons their couch?
SOOKIE: But Martha and Davy love going over there and playing with Kayla and Ryan, and when they come back, they're so polite and cordial for like an hour, which is nice.
JACKSON: That is a bonus, but still.
SOOKIE: I know. I'll get my purse. [Jackson goes over to the stove and tastes the Ratatouille] No!
JACKSON: What?
SOOKIE: Ooh! Bad batch! [Grabs the food he was about to eat and throws it in the sink] Saving it for the horses.
JACKSON: But you never mess up your Ratatouille.
SOOKIE: Well everyone's allowed a mistake or two here and there. You know what? I'm just gonna -- just junk it.
JACKSON: Are you sure? It smells fantastic.
SOOKIE: I'm sure. Trust me -- it's awful. Hey, you know what I was thinking?
What do you think about
a nice romantic dinner, huh?
How about Cicero's?
JACKSON: Wow. Cicero's.
SOOKIE: Yeah.
JACKSON: They have good Ratatouille.
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm.
JACKSON: Okay, so long as I can keep my shoes on.
SOOKIE: Unless Cicero's has suddenly gone Japanese, I think we're good.
LUKE'S DINER – NIGHT – EXTERIOR
[Luke pulls up in his truck and gets out, he spots Kirk with Lulu across the town square, they exchange looks. Luke is pleased.]
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke enters, Lane is asleep and April is watching TV]
TYRA BANKS: [on the TV] The first name that I'm going to call is... A.J.
APRIL: She was very well-behaved.
LUKE: Glad to hear it. Lane?
LANE: [Sleepy] Oh. Hey, Luke.
LUKE: I'm home.
APRIL: You zonked out about 20 minutes ago.
LANE: Well, I should probably do the rest of my zonking in my own apartment. Thank you for hanging out with me tonight, April.
APRIL: My pleasure.
LANE: See you tomorrow, Luke.
LUKE: See you tomorrow, Lane. [To April] So, you guys had fun?
APRIL: Totally. Lane's awesome. How about you?
LUKE: It was nice, you know? We had vegan food.
APRIL: Ooh. You couldn't have liked that.
LUKE: I did not, but coach Bennett really seemed to enjoy it.
APRIL: So, you're still calling her "coach Bennett"?
LUKE: Oh I think she'll just remain "coach Bennett" to me.
APRIL: That's cool.
LUKE: Mmm. Hey, is that pizza still up for grabs?
APRIL: Go crazy.
LUKE: Oh. I'm starving. Real cheese.
APRIL: We also ordered sticky buns.
LUKE: Bring it on.
[April sits next to Luke on the couch]
LUKE: Mmm-mmm-mmm. Mmm! [Chuckles, Luke looks happy.]
YALE NEWS ROOM
RORY: No quote from president Stewart yet?
BILL: Nothing.
RORY: Have we picked the photo?
RAJ: Sheila's got some options for you.
A.K.: Layout's coming along.
RORY: Good. Okay. Keep it moving. We have a deadline here.
[Telephone rings]
BILL: Ow! Who made this phone so loud? [Answers the phone] Yale daily news. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Will do. [Hangs up] We got ourselves a quote. Steve's e-mailing it in now.
RORY: Great. Okay, would you mind inputting these corrections?
BILL: Anything to get away from that phone.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, gang.
RORY: Hey.
CHRISTOPHER: We come bearing doughnuts and coffee.
LORELAI: Gather 'round. The chocolate Eclairs are to die for.
RORY: Thanks, guys.
LORELAI: We figured you'd need some all-nighter supplies.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey. So, um, I'm sorry about getting your staff drunk.
RORY: Oh, don't worry about it.
CHRISTOPHER: You seemed pretty upset at the restaurant.
RORY: I was just stressed out. It's no big deal.
CHRISTOPHER: So, you're not mad?
RORY: No. But Dad, I think I would've liked it better if on parents' weekend, I could've just had lunch with my parents.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, that would've been better. Next year -- grad-school parents' weekend.
RORY: Um.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, if it's okay with you, do you mind if we hang out and watch you in action?
RORY: Oh I don't think you can hang out, 'cause you're gonna be late.
LORELAI: Late for…
RORY: For your dinner reservations at Chez Zinjustin. I mean I told grandma and grandpa that I couldn't make it, but I think I accidentally told them you guys were free.
LORELAI: You're evil.
CHRISTOPHER: You were mad.
RORY: Isn't that a coincidence that they had a reservation, too? Oh, don't eat that doughnut 'cause I hear they have a Crme Brlée that is…
LORELAI: Don't.
RORY: Come on get your lame-o-parent selves out the door. You don't want to be late. That'll tick them off.
LORELAI: Bye.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye.
RORY: Bye-bye.

LORELAI'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR
LORELAI: Okay sweetie what do we say to mommy when we see her at the airport.
GIGI: Bonjour!
LORELAI: "Bonjour, mama! What's the haps?" I don't know the French word for "haps." [too Chris] Passports?
CHRISTOPHER: Got 'em. [too Gigi] Sweetie even after we meet up with mommy, we're gonna stay whit you all day, okay?
LORELAI: All day you will not be able to shake us. [too Chris] Cash?
CHRISTOPHER: Check.
LORELAI: Confusing shorthand.
CHRISTOPHER: Check -- I've got cash.
LORELAI: Thank you.
GIGI: Will there be food on the plane?
LORELAI: There will be food, but airplane food is one of life's cruel jokes, so, just in case, we have snacks up the whazoo. [too Chris] Are you sure the departure's 3:30? Why did I think it was later?
CHRISTOPHER: 3:30-ish.
LORELAI: That's what it says on the ticket? "Departure 3:30-ish"?
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, it doesn't matter. Traffic this time of day's impossible.
LORELAI: All right, honey. Let's go.
[Chris comes out with the last suitcase]
CHRISTOPHER: You choose a trip to France to start using free weights?
LORELAI: Those are my shoes -- of course it's heavy. You teach them and teach them, but they never learn, do they, Gigi? Why do I feel like the departure was 6:15?
CHRISTOPHER: Let's go.
LORELAI: Now, Gigi, You are gonna love Paris. You know, they call it "the city of love."
GIGI: Why?
LORELAI: Why? Well, because it's romantic, and there's just love everywhere. Of course, there's also pigeons everywhere, but nobody would want to visit the city of pigeons, now would they?
CHRISTOPHER: I think we're ready.
LORELAI: Are you gonna tell me what time this flight actually leaves?
CHRISTOPHER: Soon.
LORELAI: Your daddy is very vague, Gigi
CHRISTOPHER: How cool is it that we're going to France? You're going to have such a good time staying in Paris.
LORELAI: I am green with envy. Am I green?
CHRISTOPHER: It's more of a teal.
LORELAI: Well it goes great with my eyes. Driver, take us to France! Au revoir, house!
GIGI: Au revoir, house!
CHRISTOPHER: We're pretty low on gas. Gonna have to stop and get some.
LORELAI: Honey how do we have time to stop for gas?
CHRISTOPHER: Our flight's not for 3 1/2 hours.
LORELAI: Oh!
CHRISTOPHER: [Laugh]
LORELAI: We knew it, Gigi, Didn't we? Gigi And I knew it.
YALE NEWS ROOM
[Laughter]
BILL: So, as your newly elected editor in chief, it is my great honor to... honor...
SHEILA: okay.
BILL: ...The stepping down...
RAJ: "stepping down."
A.K.: Eloquent.
BILL: ...Of our former leader.
SHEILA: Anyone else thinking "recall"?
[Laughter, Paris looks on]
RORY: That's okay, bill. Keep going.
BILL: As I was saying, in recognition of Rory's hard work and devotion to the daily news, we have a few tokens of our appreciation. A.K.?
A.K.: This is just something to hang on your wall when you become editor of the New York Times.
RORY: Oh, thank you.
BILL: It's the front page of the last edition you edited.
A.K.: Yeah, she needed that explained.
RAJ: Rory... this is to commemorate all those articles of ours that you carefully, thoughtfully ripped to shreds.
[Laughter]
RORY: Thank you, Raj. Now I think I have to go out and buy a freakishly large pencil sharpener.
[Laughter]
JONI: I have a confession to make. I only joined the Yale Daily News as a way to meet cute guys, but after watching you handle the job of editor with intelligence and... and grace... I became inspired to become a journalist.
SHEILA: Aw!
JONI: Thank you. [Hugs Rory]
RORY: Oh! Whoa, Joni, I'm touched and a little damp.
[Laughter, Joni spilt her drink on Rory]
RORY: It's okay.
PARIS: I have a Rory story. [Others look worried] When I was running the paper, I was dying to do an article about everybody's asinine obsession with Boho Chic, but Rory had the guts to tell me that the idea for my article was trite and passé, because that's who Rory is -- honest, direct, and to the point. Like, when you all turned on me and decided you didn't want me in charge anymore, and you all chewed me up and spit me out, Rory was the one who broke the news to me. Thank you, Rory, for being the one person with integrity among a collection of cowardly backstabbers.
[Everyone is quite for a few seconds]
RORY: These are all such great stories.
BILL: To Rory.
EVERYONE: To Rory!
RORY: Thank you very much. I didn't write a speech or anything, although I could recite "The Charge of the Light Brigade," or the lyrics to "Rebel Rebel"...
A.K.: Let's hear it.
RORY: ...Neither of which I think are appropriate, but, um... look, I've really enjoyed being editor. It's been great. But it's time for a change, right? So sayeth the Yale Daily News bylaws. Um, so... [Sighs] Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your new editor in chief -- what's your name again?
BILL: Ha ha. Anyway, my first editorial move is to take everyone to Rich Man's Shoe. Drinks on me.
A.K.: All right, that's what I'm talking about!
OTHER TOGETHER: All right!
[Paris looks on with a "big deal" look on her face]
RAJ: Coming?
RORY: Huh?
RAJ: For drinks?
RORY: Uh, no. I think I'm gonna pass.
RAJ: How come?
RORY: Um, well, new editor, new regime -- I don't want it to seem like I'm still trying to be your boss.
RAJ: Yeah, no one likes someone hanging around, telling us how to get drunk.
RORY: You know what I mean.
RAJ: Yeah. See you around.
RORY: You too.
PARIS: Well, now we're both ousted leaders. Welcome to club Nixon.
RORY: [Sighs]
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT
[Lane and Zach are looking at a sonogram]
LANE: Twins, Zach.
ZACH: Right
LANE: We're having twins.
ZACH: Yeah, it's heavy, but we can handle it.
LANE: Twice as many mouths to feed, twice as much to clean up after...
ZACH: Yeah, all that -- plus, there's gonna be prejudice, but we can fight that.
LANE: What?
ZACH: And they have surgeries now, babe. This does not have to be permanent.
LANE: What doesn't?
ZACH: As long as the babies don't have some vital organ attached, they can be separated -- easy-breezy.
LANE: What are you talking about?
ZACH: Until the operation, we'll just get specially made clothes.
LANE: Zach…
ZACH: Unless they're attached at the head. Then they can wear just about anything. We just slip it on from the feet up --
LANE: Zach, we're having twins, not Siamese twins.
ZACH: [Looks at the sonogram] Oh! Dude, that is such a load off my mind! So why were you freaking out at the doctor's office?
LANE: Because we're having twins!
ZACH: Yeah but they're separate. It's, like, way easier.
LANE: Easier than what? Triplets? Siamese triplets? Yeah, Zach, twins is way easier than Siamese triplets.
ZACH: I think we have to tell your mother you're pregnant now.
LANE: Ugh... she is so going to k*ll me!
ZACH: I mean you're starting to show.
LANE: Of course I'm starting to show! My body's filling up with two growing people! She is so gonna think we had sex before the wedding, and she'll convince me we did.
ZACH: But we didn't. Believe me. I'd remember.
LANE: You don't understand. This is what she does to me. She gives me this look, and I get all panicky and start sweating. Once, at a church picnic, someone had taken a bite out of six deviled eggs and put them back on the platter. My mother accused me of doing it, and I almost confessed!
ZACH: But you hate deviled eggs.
LANE: That's the point! After she gave me that look, I wasn't sure. Maybe I had taken those bites. She gets in my head. It's like Korean voodoo.
ZACH: It's gonna be okay. It is. [Looking at the sonogram again] Whoa... you know what this picture is? Our first album cover.
LANE: Zach...
ZACH: Yeah, it's like a prenatal "Nevermind." [He kisses her on the cheek]
FRANCE – DIFFERENT SCENE OF PARIS
[Woman singing in French]
HOTEL ROOM
LORELAI: Merci... monsieur...bellhop. Jeesh.
CHRISTOPHER: Did you see that? He literally sniffed at my tip and sauntered off.
LORELAI: Yeah, he sniffed and sauntered. He did not hop.
CHRISTOPHER: The bellhop was a gem compared to the concierge. I mean isn't it his job to be polite?
LORELAI: You would think the concierge would be polite.
CHRISTOPHER: It's not like we're being obnoxious and asking someone to take a picture of us in front of Jim Morrison's grave.
LORELAI: Which, by the way, I promised Rory we would do.
CHRISTOPHER: I hope Gigi Picks up the language and the customs, but none of the rudeness.
LORELAI: Oh, no, Gigi's too sweet. She's got an impenetrable coat of sweetness around her. You shouldn't have called her Gigi, You should've called her M&M's.
CHRISTOPHER: You were great with her the whole flight. You were also great with Sherry today. Thank you.
LORELAI: She was great with me.
CHRISTOPHER: So, it's not just me, right? She does see to have it together?
LORELAI: Yeah, she seems grounded and sincere. She was nice. I couldn't believe how prepared for Gigi She was.
CHRISTOPHER: She was. She had her favorite "Madeline" book. She knew where the nearest park was. And did you see? She already had a booster seat.
LORELAI: Very impressive, by the time I got Rory one of those, she was 60 pounds. It got stuck on her butt. [Sighs] Oh, my god.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: We're in Paris!
CHRISTOPHER: You were thinking it was phoenix?
LORELAI: I just wasn't thinking anything. I mean, I was focused on getting Gigi All settled in. It slipped my mind that we're in the most beautiful city in the world!
CHRISTOPHER: The Phoenix of Europe.
LORELAI: Alright first we have to go to Harry's bar and smoke Gauloises cigarettes and get in a fight about cubism and gesticulate wildly.
CHRISTOPHER: I am going to call our friend the concierge and make a reservation at the most romantic restaurant in Paris.
LORELAI: Ask him why these beds are so insanely comfortable.
CHRISTOPHER: [On the phone] Yes, can I… [Too Lorelai] no, no, no, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! No sleeping. We are in Paris now. We are on Paris time.
LORELAI: Yes.
CHRISTOPHER: Fight the jet lag.
LORELAI: Fighting the jet lag. Jet lag strong.
CHRISTOPHER: [On the phone] Yes, I'm sorry, sir. Could I make a 8:30 reservation at L'Arpge? Yes... uh-huh, I-I understand. Thank you.
LORELAI: Did he book it?
CHRISTOPHER: He did. He also reminded us to wear shoes. I sense he has a very low opinion of Americans.
LORELAI: Well, the French might be rude, but they know how to make a very cozy bed.
CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai?
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: I know you're tired.
LORELAI: A tad.
CHRISTOPHER: I know you've been awake for something like 30 hours...
LORELAI: 32 1/2.
CHRISTOPHER: ...Just to help me make the transition easier for Gigi, And I really appreciate it.
LORELAI: Aww, don't mention it.
CHRISTOPHER: And I just want to show you the best possible time that you can have in Paris because you deserve it.
LORELAI: Aww, you're sweet.
CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai...
LORELAI: hmm?
CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai!
LORELAI: Okay, all right. Yes, we're gonna get up, 'cause we're in Paris, and we're gonna have a great Parisian time.
CHRISTOPHER: We are!
LORELAI: Yes! Hey, is the tour de France still going on? 'Cause we could stand on a little Paris street and yell "whoo-hoo" when the guys go by, or I could pour a cup of water on one of them. As he goes whipping by.
CHRISTOPHER: Actually, the tour de France was a couple of months ago.
LORELAI: Aw…
CHRISTOPHER: But we are going to a beautiful, intimate restaurant, and after we finish our meal, you can throw water on me.
LORELAI: Whoo-hoo!
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles, kisses her cheek.]
YALE - HALLWAY
[Rory and Paris are walking]
PARIS: What are you doing right now?
RORY: Not much.
PARIS: Would you mind swinging by the library to drop these off? I'd do it, but I just got cornered by professor Edwards. She wants to meet for coffee in five minutes to discuss me being her T.A. Second semester. I got to start thinking about life after graduation. Cozying up to professor Edwards could be a fast pass to a fellowship.
RORY: I guess that's true.
PARIS: What about you?
RORY: What about me?
PARIS: You looking into fellowships? Scholarships? Grad schools?
RORY: Not really. I mean, not yet. I will, probably.
PARIS: Time's running out. They only give the LSAT one more time before spring. Anyway thanks for dropping off the books. I don't mean to make you run out of your way I just thought you have a lot of free time since you don't work at the paper anymore.
RORY: That is true.
PARIS: What are you taking, by the way?
RORY: Taking?
PARIS: Just remember, Tricyclic antidepressants are better than your Monoamine Oxidase inhibitors, since those are for panic attacks. It doesn't look like you're there yet.
RORY: I have no plans of going there.
PARIS: You will. I know when I was finished as editor, I went into a major tailspin, couldn't you tell?
RORY: Well you masked it so well with your generally gloomy disposition.
PARIS: The first day is hard. Then it just gets worse.
RORY: As it happens, I am totally relieved that my job at the paper is over.
PARIS: Yeah I did the denial thing, too. I even tried smiling a lot. That got old, and I think it made this line.
RORY: That'll teach you to smile.
PARIS: You really shouldn't be alone at a time like this. Why don't you call your "girls gone wild" friends? They seem delightful in a "get crazy-drunk in Cancun and flash your breasts" kind of way.
RORY: Your take on Lucy and Olivia is so not them.
PARIS: Whatever. Later. Oh, and Lexapro is fast-acting, but side effects are weight gain and noticeable drop in sexual appetite. Of course, with Logan gone, that's moot.
RORY: Always a pleasure, Paris.
MRS KIMS ANTIQUES – KITCHEN
[Lane, Zach and Mrs Kim are having dinner, they are very quite, no one is talking.]
MRS KIM: How's the Maeun-Tang?
LANE: Good!
ZACH: Yeah! Really good Maeun-Tang.
MRS KIM: How was work?
ZACH: Oh, yeah, my work is good.
LANE: My work is good.
MRS KIM: That's good.
LANE: [Sighs] This is great dinner, mama.
MRS KIM: I'm glad you like it. It's been too long since we had dinner together.
ZACH: Way too long.
MRS KIM: I think you've been avoiding me, and I know why.
LANE: We haven't been avoiding…
MRS KIM: Do not try to fool me. I know what's going on. [Lane and Zach look at each other concerned] You have no new music to show me, and you are ashamed.
ZACH: Music?
MRS KIM: Yes, music -- the thing you say you want to do for a living.
ZACH: Oh, no, I do! Yeah I've been working on some stuff.
MRS KIM: What kind of stuff?
ZACH: Actually I've been experimenting with different instruments. Like I've been playing the electric mandolin, which sounds really far out…
LANE: Mom, I'm pregnant! [Mrs Kim is surprised] We waited until after we were married! If you don't believe us, we have a note from our doctor, which doesn't prove anything, but it does!
[Lane and Zach talking over each other]
ZACH: Hit me! Hit me!…
LANE: Firmly established…
ZACH: It's my fault!…
LANE: It happened during the…
MRS KIM: a new child is a great blessing.
LANE: Really?
MRS KIM: Chuka hamnida, Lane and Zach.
LANE: She says, "congratulations."
ZACH: Really? Then you should say "chuka hamnida hamnida" because we're having twins.
MRS KIM: Twins?
LANE: Twins.
MRS KIM: Oh, that's wonderful. So, Monday, you move in with me.
ZACH: Cool.
MRS KIM: I must go e-mail this good news to our relatives in Pusan. They just got wi-fi.
LANE: "Cool"?!
PARIS – HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
[Siren wailing]
LORELAI: [Gasps] No! Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no!
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: Honey, get up! Get up!
CHRISTOPHER: I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! What? We got to go, right? I-I got to shave?
LORELAI: No, not unless you're a werewolf!
CHRISTOPHER: What? It's the middle of the night!
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: It's 4:00!
CHRISTOPHER: What's 4:00?
LORELAI: That. It.
CHRISTOPHER: It's 4:00?
LORELAI: Yes! It's 4:00! We fell asleep! Damn the French and their comfortable beds!
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, we must've dozed off around 7:00. We just had ourselves a 9-hour nap.
LORELAI: Nine hours?! That's not a nap -- that's a coma.
CHRISTOPHER: Wow, the city looks really beautiful... and dead.
LORELAI: Ugh, okay -- this place is very tastefully decorated and everything, but would it k*ll them to put a minibar in here? I'm starving.
CHRISTOPHER: Me too.
LORELAI: [Sighs] You don't think they're still holding our table at L'Arpge, do you?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm guessing our table at L'Arpge smells of disinfectant and has two chairs on top of it.
LORELAI: Ohhh!
CHRISTOPHER: It's okay, it's okay! I can fix this! Um room service! What are you in the mood for?
LORELAI: Um... I would like a cheeseburger with a side of cheeseburger, and see if they can make me a cheeseburger smoothie.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, if they can make goose innards into a tasty spread, I'm sure they can make a cheeseburger smoothie.
LORELAI: Ha-ha
CHRISTOPHER: [On the phone] Yes, sir, hi. I would like to order some room service.
LORELAI: What'd he say?
CHRISTOPHER: He didn't say, so much as chortle.
LORELAI: No room service? And no minibar? But two toilets. Where are their priorities?
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, let me float another plan.
LORELAI: Don't say "float" unless "root beer" is attached to it.
CHRISTOPHER: It's after 4:00. Why don't we get a few more hours' sleep, we wake up early, feast on a delicious French breakfast, and then we hit Paris totally refreshed
LORELAI: Oh, fine... crummy Europe. Crummy time change. We switched to the metric system -- why don't they switch to our time zone?
CHRISTOPHER: We didn't actually switch…
LORELAI: I know!
CHRISTOPHER: [Groans]
LATER…
LORELAI: Never been so wide awake.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm more wide awake.
LORELAI: So wide awake I could watch the Ken Burns documentary of "sod" and not drift off.
CHRISTOPHER: There are 104 fleur-de-lis stencid on the ceiling -- that's how wide awake I am.
LORELAI: I tried Humming Brahms' "Lullaby" in my head, but it kept morphing into "Purple Rain," and "Purple Rain" made me think of grapes, which made me think of grape jam, which made me think of English muffins slathered in grape jam.
CHRISTOPHER: Hold it -- this is the greatest city in the world. There is a restaurant out there, still open, with candles and soft lighting and great food, and I'm gonna find it for you.
LORELAI: My hero.
CHRISTOPHER: Besides, just being out on the Paris streets late at night -- what could be more romantic?
[They kiss]
LORELAI: Being out on the Paris streets late at night eating a big, fat cheeseburger.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles]
LOGAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
[Rory is alone in the apartment, it's very quite]
RORY: [Sighs]
[She dials a number on her Sidekick]
OLIVIA: Hello?
[Music is playing in the background]
RORY: Hey, it's Rory.
OLIVIA: Hey, what's going on?
RORY: Not a lot. What's up with you?
OLIVIA: I'm sitting here making a mobile for my sister's baby. But it's turning out really good, so I might just keep it for myself and give the baby socks.
RORY: Or make her a mobile out of socks.
OLIVIA: Oh, that's genius.
RORY: What's Lucy doing?
OLIVIA: Watching "Real World: Denver." Lucy's eating it up with a fork and spoon 'cause boyfriend's working, and you know how much he hates reality TV.
RORY: Does he?
OLIVIA: I keep forgetting -- you still haven't met boyfriend.
RORY: Yeah, I'm beginning to wonder if he really exists, or if he's just Lucy's Snuffleupagus.
OLIVIA: Lucy, it's Rory!
LUCY: [Gasps] Hey! What's up, girl?
RORY: Hey, Lucy!
OLIVIA: Rory says "hey." [She puts the phone on speaker]
RORY: You guys feel like doing something?
LUCY: We should go somewhere!
RORY: Cool, where do you want to go?
LUCY: I want to go to the country, get off campus. It's the weekend. Let's get out of here.
OLIVIA: I'd so love to go to, like, a cabin in the woods.
LUCY: Or just a house.
RORY: We could...go to my house.
LUCY: Yeah?
RORY: I mean, it's in Stars Hollow. It's this really small town, and there's not a lot to do...
LUCY: Oh, my god. Does your house have a yard?
OLIVIA: And a porch?
RORY: The house has a yard and a porch with a swing, and the swing makes this little creaking sound.
LUCY: That sounds so perfect.
OLIVIA: When we get there, I'm definitely mixing up a batch of lemonade and flirting with slim, the hired hand.
RORY: Slim the hired hand is a hottie, but he's missing a hand. Ironic, huh? Pick you up in a little bit?
LUCY: We'll be here.
RORY: Bye.
PARIS – NIGHT
[Woman singing in French plays as they show shots of Paris, Lorelai and Chris are walking the streets looking for food.]
CHRISTOPHER: So, class, the word for "closed" is...
LORELAI: You know after seeing this sign in seven different restaurants, it's no longer informative -- it's just mocking.
CHRISTOPHER: This place looks good.
LORELAI: Even the sound of it -- Fermé.
CHRISTOPHER: Let's try around the corner.
LORELAI: It has a mocking tone. "Ha ha, fermé." Do you hear that?
CHRISTOPHER: I hear a woman who's delusional with hunger. Come on.
LORELAI: See, this is why French people are so skinny -- they have no late-night snacks.
CHRISTOPHER: How do you explain Gérard Depardieu?
LORELAI: Oh, that's obvious. Gérard Depardieu has hogged all the food.
[They spot some one eating]
LORELAI: Ooh, ooh!
CHRISTOPHER: Did you see that?
LORELAI: Yeah. Oh, I saw that.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on.
LORELAI: What do you say? You hit him high, I hit him low.
CHRISTOPHER: Monsieur?!
LORELAI: Hello.
CHRISTOPHER: Wait -- attendez! We just want to know where you got the sandwich!
LORELAI: Oh, look what you did!
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: You charged him. Everyone knows you don't charge a bear or a man with a sandwich.
CHRISTOPHER: [Sniffs]
LORELAI: [gasps]
CHRISTOPHER: That's a lot of bread.
LORELAI: What are the chances there's a butter truck nearby?
CHRISTOPHER: Uh, pardonne-moi. Bonsoir. Nous avons, hungry, hungry, hungry...
LORELAI: I got it. I got it. Mmmm! Mmm! Ahhh!
BREAD GUY: [French accent] Funny Americans, huh? [Chuckles]
LORELAI: Yeah, funny. Hungry Americans, huh?
BREAD GUY: [French accent] "Everybody loves Raymond." [Chuckles]
CHRISTOPHER: No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
BREAD GUY: [Laughs, gets in the truck and drives off]
CHRISTOPHER: Happy people, the French. [Looks at Lorelai and giggles] What?
LORELAI: Nothing. It's weird... it's just being this hungry makes me think of this time when we were in 10th grade, and, for some reason, I had to make up this chemistry exam during lunch, and it went on and on and on forever, and then finally, when I was done, I came out.. and there you were, waiting for me. And you took this slice of pizza from the cafeteria out of your coat pocket, and you gave it to me.
CHRISTOPHER: Pepperoni -- I remember.
LORELAI: Even then, you were so sweet.
CHRISTOPHER: Head back to the hotel?
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. You don't still have that pizza anywhere, do you?
CHRISTOPHER: Different coat. Darn!
LUKE'S DINER - NIGHT
ZACH: Babe, could you check on my order?
LANE: Oh, I did. I asked Luke where it was, and Luke said, "from now on, if Zach wants to eat here, "he has to stand on his head in the middle of the diner and eat out of a rusty bucket." So I said, "cool!"
ZACH: I couldn't help it, Lane! I was so relieved that your mother wasn't pissed off about the pregnancy. "Cool" just came out, like a happy vocal burp.
LANE: Next time, cover your mouth! Jeez! [She walks away from the table, Kirk puts his hand on her stomach.] Kirk, what are you doing?
KIRK: Trying to feel a kick.
LANE: You're gonna feel a kick if you don't get your hand off my stomach.
KIRK: So, I don't know if you've decided where you're gonna drop this little load, but I highly recommend Woodbury memorial, where I was born.
LANE: Good to know.
KIRK: The maternity suites there are primo, and they let the mother hold the baby post-delivery as long as she wants. Explains a lot about the relationship between me and my mother.
LANE: Yes, it does.
LUKE: Kirk, go away and stop harassing my employees. [Too Lane] You should sit awhile.
LANE: No, I'm fine! Standing's no problem.
LUKE: All right, but from now on, no more serving heavy food -- your meat loaves, your bowls of stew. Somebody who orders that -- let Caesar carry it. He needs the workout.
LANE: Well, that's not really…
LUKE: And if you have any questions or are worried about anything having to do with... you know, what's going on there, call my sister, Liz -- she's a veteran.
LANE: Thanks, Luke.
LUKE: Anyway, uh... you two are gonna be great. You'll be great parents.
LANE: Zach... we're gonna be parents.
ZACH: Yeah, it's like... we're not just kids anymore. We're one of them now.
LANE: Parents don't have to be told what to do. Parents do the telling.
ZACH: That's right. Besides, if we say no, what's the worst your mother could do? [Lane give Zach a worrying look and walks away] Seriously, b-babe, w-what is the worst she could do?
WARNING – the following scene may contain disturbing dialogue.
PARIS – HOTEL – NIGHT
LORELAI: [Lorelai sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
LORELAI: What, "yeah"?
CHRISTOPHER: That's at I'm talking about.
LORELAI: Yeah?
CHRISTOPHER: I'll say.
LORELAI: I can barely talk.
CHRISTOPHER: Uh-huh, which is, uh...
LORELAI: Saying something?
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles] I could just live in this room forever.
LORELAI: Let's.
CHRISTOPHER: Except…
LORELAI: No "except." It's decided. Call the guy. Come seal the doors.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm too hungry!
LORELAI: Me too.
CHRISTOPHER: My stomach is a pit.
LORELAI: I know. If I don't eat something, my stomach's gonna eat me.
CHRISTOPHER: We need to food food! [Gets out of bed]
LORELAI: We do! [Sighs, sits up in bed] Look at that view. It's so beautiful, I could eat it.
CHRISTOPHER: [Sighs] Oh, my god.
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: I could totally fix this!
LORELAI: How?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm not gonna tell you. [they kiss] Let's shower.
LORELAI: Tell me.
CHRISTOPHER: It's a surprise.
LORELAI: Tell me.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm not gonna tell you.
LORELAI: Come on!
CHRISTOPHER: Not telling.
LORELAI: Is this your fix? To get me to think about what your fix is instead of thinking about food, huh?!
CHRISTOPHER: Is it working?
LORELAI: A little.
CHRISTOPHER: All I can tell you is it's bigger than a breadbox.
LORELAI: Mmm, bread.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on!
LORELAI: Okay!



LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR – NIGHT
[the girls are sitting on the swing, they have foil in there hair.]
RORY: There's Dean.
LUCY: Ooh, Dean is smokin'.
OLIVIA: Oh, yeah. Dean's a fox.
LUCY: He looks tall.
RORY: He is. How can you tell from a picture of his face?
LUCY: Oh it's a talent I have.
RORY: Spooky.
LUCY: Yeah right I figure I'll be recruit by the FBI any day now.
RORY: It's a very specific specialty.
OLIVIA: Oh wait, there you are.
RORY: That was my first year at the Chilton paper.
OLIVIA: Look at you and your big Rory smile.
LUCY: Um what are you there -- 5'2"?
RORY: More like 5'7".
LUCY: Are you sure, you don't look 5'7"?
RORY: I'm sure. Hey is this dye supposed to smell all vinegary?
LUCY: Mm-hmm.
OLIVIA: It means it's working.
RORY: I feel like an easter egg.
LUCY: Boyfriend is gonna totally freak when he sees this color.
RORY: Freak, like, be mad?
LUCY: No. First, he'll be like, "whoa," then like, "I like it," and I'll be like, "thanks," and he'll be all, "I thought you looked pretty good before, too," and I'll be like, "better?" And he'll be like, "I think you look good no matter what you do," and I'll be like, "what if I got a Mohawk?" And he'll be like, "even if you had a Mohawk," and then we'll look at each other all goony-eyed, and we'll kiss, and he'll say, "don't get a Mohawk."
OLIVIA: And too bad if he doesn't like it. Serves him right for working all the time.
LUCY: Boyfriend's got great hair.
OLIVIA: Oh, the best. It's, like, beyond human.
RORY: Like, Conan O'Brien's?
LUCY: No, it's, like, really full. It's more like a cartoon character.
OLIVIA: Yeah, it's like snap's hair from snap, crackle, and pop. Wait, am I thinking of crackle?
RORY: Is crackle the one who wears a hat?
LUCY: They all wear hats. It's like part of their uniform.
RORY: Yeah, but one of them wears it all the way on his head, and one wears it further back so his bangs swoop out.
OLIVIA: That's pop. The blond one's definitely pop.
LUCY: Okay so boyfriend's got the color of crackle and the style of pop.
RORY: Ooh! We should make Rice Krispy Treats.
LUCY: Oh, my gosh!
OLIVIA: Yes!
[They go inside]
RORY: I think there is a cake pan in that broom closet.
OLIVIA: Broom closet?
RORY: Yeah, my mom's not really into baking or booms. Okay, so the butter's in the fridge, and I will get the marshmallows and the Rice Krispies.
OLIVIA: Oh, my god! Come here, you guys! It's Rory through the ages.
RORY: Oh, I totally forgot that was there.
LUCY: How cool is this? Can you believe you were this short in 1991?
RORY: No.
OLIVIA: Check out the next year, you sh*t up like a weed.
RORY: That's when I finally quit smoking.
LUCY: This is awesome you have a record of you literally growing up, and here you are when you're, like, 7, and then here you are when you're ready to graduate college.
RORY: Yeah. It's freaky. Oh! There's the cake pan. Let's get cookin'!
PARIS - NIGHT
[Lorelai and Chris come to an empty restaurant]
LORELAI: Well, well, what do you know? Fermé. [Chris knocks] Listen, honey, if they weren't open at 11:00, I don't think they're gonna be open at 5:00 in the morning.
CHRISTOPHER: Trust me.
LORELAI: Trust is not the point. The point is food and finding some, not standing in front of closed restaurants feel…
MAITRE D': Monsieur Hayden...Mademoiselle Gilmore.
CHRISTOPHER: That's us.
MAITRE D': Welcome to L'Arpge. Please come in. Your table is ready.
LORELAI: [Gasps]
CHRISTOPHER: After you, mademoiselle.
LORELAI: Oh.
[They are seated]
LORELAI: Thank you.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thanks. [too Chris] What is this?
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles]
WAITER: I'll give you a moment to peruse the wine list. Please let me know if you have any question.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. We will.
LORELAI: Merci.
[The waiter opens the curtains to reveal the Eiffel Tower in the view]
LORELAI: [Inhales deeply]
CHRISTOPHER: Pretty cool, huh?
LORELAI: How did you…
CHRISTOPHER: I'm thinking the '78 Latour. Sounds like a classic car.
LORELAI: Honey, how did you do this?
CHRISTOPHER: I have my ways.
LORELAI: Tell me!
CHRISTOPHER: You really want to know?
LORELAI: Yeah!
CHRISTOPHER: It might take away some of the magic.
LORELAI: I'll risk it.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I was lying in bed and I was just thinking about us and how, when we were 16, we planned our trip to Paris, but it kind of got derailed.
LORELAI: [Laughs] I'll say.
CHRISTOPHER: And then I was thinking about how amazing it is that after everything -- the years, the distance, the screw-ups, everything -- we finally managed to make it here and how, in some ways, it feels like nothing has changed and no time has passed.
LORELAI: I know.
CHRISTOPHER: But then I started thinking about all the things that have changed.
LORELAI: When did you do all this thinking?
CHRISTOPHER: And I realized the one big thing that has changed is that now... I'm totally loaded.
LORELAI: [Chuckling] Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: And I guess, in some ways, I'm not quite used to it because I didn't even think, earlier, that I might be able to use that.
LORELAI: You totally bribed them to open.
CHRISTOPHER: Not bribed -- gave financial incentive.
LORELAI: Oh, my god!
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles] I know.
LORELAI: You totally bribed them to open!
CHRISTOPHER: You don't have to whisper. Everybody here knows.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] I just can't believe that people really...do this.
CHRISTOPHER: Apparently.
LORELAI: Cool!
CHRISTOPHER: Right? And I was prepared to do other things to get you fed. I had backup plans that included theft and chicanery.
LORELAI: Ooh. Chicanery? For me?
CHRISTOPHER: Anything for you. Anything. So, you happy?
LORELAI: Really happy. This is wonderful. You didn't have to do it, you know?
CHRISTOPHER: I wanted to.
LORELAI: I would've been happy with a croissant.
CHRISTOPHER: Or a park bench. I know.
LORELAI: Why a park bench?
CHRISTOPHER: Remember when we were 16 and planning to go to Paris? We always said we'd sleep on a park bench.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah! Well, because we didn't have any money, so we couldn't afford a hotel we'd have to sleep on a park bench. I can't believe you remember that.
CHRISTOPHER: I'd still sleep on a park bench with you.
LORELAI: Name the bench.
MAITRE D': Compliments of the chef... Langoustine on a bed of mush and candied carrot cannelle. Have you decided on the wine?
CHRISTOPHER: Yes. We're gonna go with the '78 Latour.
MAITRE D': Excellent choice, monsieur.
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles]
LORELAI: I love you.
CHRISTOPHER: I love you, too.
LORELAI: So, this fix? Not only bigger than a breadbox, also a lot better.
CHRISTOPHER: Told you.
LORELAI: Hey, when we're done, can we go back to that beautiful bed?
CHRISTOPHER: You don't want to sleep on a park bench?
LORELAI: Mmm... no park bench.
[They Kiss]
CHRISTOPHER: Thank god.
MRS KIMS ANTIQUES
MRS KIM: Oh this is very nice.
LANE: So, mama, the reason we wanted to talk to you is 'cause…
MRS KIM: If you're wondering about your room, it isn't ready yet.
LANE: We weren't wondering -- mama!
MRS KIM: You want two separate beds, correct?
LANE: Well, that's not really the issue.
MRS KIM: Better for Zach to have his own bed. Soon, you will be giant. Who can sleep with that?
LANE: Mama, could you stop for a minute? We really need to talk.
MARTY: I have to unload this shipment. I may be old, but I can multitask.
ZACH: The thing is, Mrs. Kim, when you said that we should move in with you and I said, "cool," what I meant was, "that's cool... "that you're offering to have us move in, but... no."
MRS KIM: What do you mean, "no"?
LANE: We really appreciate the offer, mama, but Zach and are going to be parents soon, and we're adults...
ZACH: You know, young adults. Not like I'm gonna be smoking a pipe, and she's gonna be all, "hey, let's watch '60 minutes.'"
LANE: ...And we're gonna be starting our own family, and it's important to us that we do that in our own home. We can do this, mama. We're ready.
MRS KIM: Very well. I respect your decision.
[Lane and Zach look at each other]
LANE: Cool!
LORELAI'S HOUSE - BATHROOM
OLIVIA: How much do you love this hair?
RORY: So much!
LUCY: Okay now we're gonna have to start a girl band.
OLIVIA: We so have to.
LUCY: We'll pretend we're a Norwegian girl band, and we can purposely lip-synch just slightly off.
OLIVIA: Oh, we'll be famous!
LUCY: We'll be huge! You can write articles about us in the Yale Daily News.
RORY: Yeah.
LUCY: You can say things like, we're the hottest thing to come out of Norway since... what came out of Norway?
OLIVIA: We got the Vikings, Edvard Munch, and that's all I got.
LUCY: I mean, you still have an in at the newspaper, right?
OLIVIA: Sure she does. It's like once you're president, you're president forever, unless you get assassinated.
LUCY: Actually, it's good Rory's not editor anymore. More time to be in "The Forbidden Fjords."
OLIVIA: Okay yeah.
LUCY: Wait. We need to discuss the name. Rory, where are you on "The Forbidden Fjords"?
[Rory starts to cry]
LUCY: Oh, my god. Rory, are you okay?
RORY: I'm fine.
OLIVIA: Do you hate your hair?
LUCY: 'Cause you can change it.
OLIVIA: So easy.
RORY: No, no, no, I love my hair. It's -- it's nothing. It's stupid.
LUCY: It's not nothing.
OLIVIA: What is it?
RORY: [Crying] Everything is just...ending. I just feel like everything is gonna be over. I'm done at the paper. Soon I'm gonna be done at Yale, and it's just like I'm standing on this cliff, looking out into this huge, foggy...
LUCY: Abyss?
RORY: [They starts to sit on the bathroom floor]...Like, a huge, foggy abyss, and, in my whole life, there's never been an abyss. It's been abyssless. I've always known exactly what is in front of me, and I've always known exactly where I'm going, and now...I don't know what's out there.
OLIVIA: Besides fog.
RORY: A ton of fog, and I hate not knowing what is out there. I mean, what's going to happen to my career and my relationship with Logan and the rest of my life?
LUCY: Rory...
RORY: I'm so sorry, I don't mean to... drag everything down.
LUCY: I so know what you're talking about.
OLIVIA: Totally!
RORY: Really?
LUCY: Are you kidding? Once I move that tassel to the other side, I have no idea what the hell I'm gonna do. I mean, besides that FBI gig.
OLIVIA: I'm an art major -- not like that's an obvious road sign to the rest of my life.
RORY: I can't believe you guys worry about this. I mean, you're so carpe diem-ish.
LUCY: But how could you not be worried about it?
OLIVIA: Everywhere you turn, someone's talking about their brilliant plans for next year.
LUCY: I mean even our friends that were laid-back -- English majors, philosophy majors -- they're talking about coming investment bankers. When did that happen?
OLIVIA: Traitors.
LUCY: The other day, somebody used the phrase "negative amortization." What the hell is that?!
RORY: [Sighs] I have no idea what I'm doing. Maybe I should be applying to grad schools. I mean... journalism school or law school. Maybe I should go to law school.
LUCY: Dude, you don't want to go to law school.
RORY: I so don't want to go to law school.
PARIS – RESTAURANT
[Music plays]
LORELAI: You're amazing.
CHRISTOPHER: No, you are.
LORELAI: Don't start a fight with me. I'm trying to say thank you.
CHRISTOPHER: You're welcome.
LORELAI: I mean, this is ridiculous. This is incredible. Here we are just finishing dinner, and the sun is coming up and people are just going to work. I mean, it's just all so unreal. I feel like any minute the waiters could break into song.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, if you want...what?
LORELAI: I'm just so happy.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah. I don't ever want to leave Paris.
CHRISTOPHER: I know.
LORELAI: I don't want it to be over, I don't want it to end.
CHRISTOPHER: Well it doesn't have to end. When we get back to Stars Hollow, we can sleep all day and wander the town in the night, and... that stuff we did back in the hotel room -- we can definitely do that back in stars hollow.
LORELAI: Are you saying we'll always have Paris?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm saying I love you, Lorelai.
LORELAI: I love you, too.
CHRISTOPHER: And, Lor?
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: Remember when I told you that I would wait till we were both 80 for you to figure out us?
LORELAI: U-us?
CHRISTOPHER: You and me?
LORELAI: Right.
CHRISTOPHER: I don't want to wait.
LORELAI: Chris...
CHRISTOPHER: I mean it.
LORELAI: But don't you think it's -- it's too soon?
CHRISTOPHER: No.
LORELAI: We've only been dating a few months.
CHRISTOPHER: Try 25 years.
LORELAI: I know, but you know what I mean.
CHRISTOPHER: So it's taken us this long to work it out, to figure it out, but we're here now. We're ready. We're finally ready. Let's do it, let's do it right here in Paris.
LORELAI: No, n-not here.
CHRISTOPHER: Why not?
LORELAI: Well, Rory...
CHRISTOPHER: Rory? Rory will be thrilled.
LORELAI: Honey, I love you, I really do, but... I think we should wait.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Lor. We love each other. We belong together. What do you say? Marry me.
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT - EXTERIOR
[Lane and Zach are coming home]
LANE: No
ZACH: But those are cool names, and whenever we call for "Marco," polo would answer with his name, so we'd always know where he was.
LANE: No.
[They enter the apartment]
LANE: We don't even know if they're going to be boys. [Stops] Mama!
MRS KIM: This place is a death trap!
LANE: What are you doing.
MRS KIM: We must think like a baby. Anything that can be grabbed with little baby hands must be put up high or locked away in cupboards.
ZACH: How'd she get in?
MRS KIM: Who couldn't get in? Hiding a key under the mat is like hosting a burglars-only open house.
LANE: Mama we're gonna baby-proof the apartment, but we've still got like months.
MRS KIM: Of course, the drum kit has to go into storage, and you must throw away all of these.
ZACH: My guitar picks?
MRS KIM: To you, they are guitar picks. To a baby, they are candy waiting to be choked on.
ZACH: That's true. One time, I was tuning to an open "e" and holding a pick between my teeth, and Brian made this really funny sound, and I snorted a laugh, so the pick went sh**ting to the back of my throat.
LANE: Mama, did you shop for us?
MRS KIM: Yes, and I will cook dinner as soon as I am finished unpacking.
LANE: Unpacking?
MRS KIM: My things. [They turn to see some suitcases] You are adults now. You should raise your children in your own home. It would be wrong for you to move in with me, so I will move in with you… Cool?
ZACH: Um...
LANE: [Worried] Mama? Where's Brian?
MRS KIM: Don't worry about Brian. Brian is fine.
[Cut to a scene of Brian having dinner with his new "Korean family"]
BRIAN: Um, could you please pass the Bulgogi?
YALE - HALLWAY
[The girls are walking]
LUCY: French fries.
RORY: Yep.
LUCY: Definitely French fries.
OLIVIA: Even if I haven't even gone within a mile of one...
RORY: Always smell like French fries after a road trip.
LUCY: Smell like? Feel like. A thin layer of vegetable grease all over me. [She unlocks the door and enters.] Boyfriend!
MARTY: Hey!
OLIVIA: I think boyfriend's here.
RORY: No way.
MARTY: Mmm!
LUCY: So once we saw the hair, it was like obvious -- girl band. Rory has the most awesome house. You have to meet Rory. Rory... this is boyfriend.
RORY: Oh! I…
MARTY: Actually, it's Marty. Nice to meet you.
RORY: [Confused] You too.
OLIVIA: Okay... I got to show you the dresses for our Norwegian band. So perfect.
LUCY: Go get yours. [Too Rory] You're going to be, like, "we have to wear these dresses."
[They go off to change]
RORY: What's going on?
MARTY: What do you mean?
RORY: Um...why did you just pretend like you didn't know me?
MARTY: Oh... I just thought it would be weird.
RORY: Weird? That we were friends? Why would that be weird?
MARTY: Well, what's the difference? I mean, it's not important.
RORY: But... yeah, but we used to hang out all the time you know…
LUCY: Ta-da!
OLIVIA: Give it up for The Forbidden Fjords!
LUCY: Aren't these perfect?
RORY: They are. They're perfect.
OLIVIA: Two Halloweens ago, Lucy and I went to a party as "and Dawn," without Tony Orlando.
LUCY: [Too Marty, now sitting on the couch together] Do you like me in this dress?
MARTY: Yeah, you look nice and shiny. Goes great with your hair.
LUCY: Thank you. [Too Rory] Was I right? Doesn't boyfriend have unreal hair?
RORY: [Smiling] He does.
LUCY: So, the road trip…
OLIVIA: It was so far out.
LUCY: The town where Rory grew up is, like, your perfect small town.
[Rory looks hurt but puts on a fake smile]
OLIVIA: You expect professor Harold hill to move there and sucker everyone into buying band instruments.
LUCY: It's, like, ideal, but not scary, "a serial k*ll lives next door" ideal. 4-h club ideal.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Night time, Lorelai and Chris enter, Lorelai puts the keys down and looks around]
LORELAI: Bonsoir, house.
CHRISTOPHER: Feels good to be home, huh?
LORELAI: So good. [sits on the couch] It's funny when you go away, even on a short trip... everything looks a little different when you get back. [Chris sits next to Lorelai]
CHRISTOPHER: Yep.
LORELAI: Of course, now I'm seeing it with a French perspective.
CHRISTOPHER: How's it look in French?
LORELAI: American and dusty.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm gonna go get the rest of our stuff.
[They kiss]
CHRISTOPHER: Welcome home, Mrs. Hayden.
[Lorelai has an uncomfortable look on her face as she looks at the ring on her finger, Chris goes to get the bags.]

LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai on the phone]
LORELAI: It's me and you father, we're home. I don't know if you forgot, but we've been in Paris, and we flew across oceans and oceans just to see you again. And, so, we would really like to see you again -- today, tonight, A.S.A.P., Okay? So please call me, call me back. S.T.A.S.A.P -- sooner than as soon as possible. Okay, honey, call me. Call me. Call me. Call. Okay. Bye.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, that was your last one. I'm cutting you off. She will call you when she wakes up.
LORELAI: [groans]
CHRISTOPHER: Now sit.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: I need an open mind. Are you giving me an open mind?
LORELAI: Okay, it's open.
CHRISTOPHER: Wide open?
LORELAI: Yeah, blue skies, green grass, vistas as far as the eye can see.
CHRISTOPHER: Good, because I want you to picture, on this wall, a waterfall.
LORELAI: Huh?
CHRISTOPHER: You know like one of those wall waterfalls -- they're really soothing.
LORELAI: Slam.
CHRISTOPHER: What.
LORELAI: The sound of my mind closing.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on we could get a Barcalounger right here and just lean back and listen – it would be like living in Hawaii.
LORELAI: Are you serious -- a Barcalounger?
CHRISTOPHER: Soft leather, adjustable footrest. You know what else would be awesome?
LORELAI: Not having a Barcalounger?
CHRISTOPHER: Flat-screen TV here -- high def, day and night. And you know what else might work? One of those electronic fish -- what do they call it? -- The Big-mouth Billy Bass fish. You know what they are right. When somebody walks by, they flap their mouths and sing songs like "don't worry, be happy" and "take me to the river."
LORELAI: You're kidding.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm totally kidding, except for the flat-screen. We need a flat screen.
LORELAI: No! I'd rather have the Big-mouth Billy Bass fish.
CHRISTOPHER: What's wrong?
LORELAI: It's so "meet George Jetson, his boy, Elroy" -- Leroy?
CHRISTOPHER: Elroy -- and it's not. Look, I'm all for small-town charm. I'm happy to move here, sit out on the front porch, and give the mailman a real chipper "howdy-do."
LORELAI: Don't you dare.
CHRISTOPHER: But there's a line. I'm not gonna cobble my own shoes, churn butter, or watch a TV from 1976.
LORELAI: What? This baby has a remote that has 19 buttons on it.
CHRISTOPHER: You do have running water, don't you?
LORELAI: Hardy har har.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, you can say "hardy har har," but I can't say "howdy-do"?
LORELAI: Life's not fair.
CHRISTOPHER: What's your problem with a giant flat-screen? I mean you love TV.
LORELAI: Yeah but just because I love something doesn't mean I want it to be giant. I love grapes, you know, but I don't want to sit down and eat one humongous gr-- no, that would be fun. [Phone rings] Hello?
RORY: Hey. Welcome home.
LORELAI: Finally! I have been calling and calling.
RORY: Yes, I know, since 5:00 A.M.
LORELAI: Well, that's noon Parisian time.
RORY: Well then you should call your Parisian daughter because your American one was asleep.
CHRISTOPHER: Hi, honey.
LORELAI: Your dad says hi.
RORY: High dad how was the trip?
LORELAI: Um tonight, I'll tell you everything when you come for dinner tonight.
RORY: I can't come tonight.
LORELAI: What you have to.
RORY: I have a study group. My major English quotes professor's trying to k*ll me.
LORELAI: Well, all the more reason to stay away from him. Seriously, he sounds dangerous.
RORY: I'll come over the weekend.
LORELAI: No, Rory, it has to be tonight.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Uh...s-snails.
RORY: Snails?
LORELAI: W-we -- your dad and I brought back snails.
RORY: Like for eating?
LORELAI: Yes, and if we don't cook them tonight, they'll go bad.
[Chris looks on amused]
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Well, it's true. It has to be tonight. Please.
RORY: Fine. I'll be there.
LORELAI: Good!
RORY: I'm going back to bed.
LORELAI: Oh what at 1:00 in the afternoon? Lazy girl. My Parisian daughter's such a go-getter. She's been up and around for hours.
RORY: See you tonight.
LORELAI: All right, she's coming.
CHRISTOPHER: Snails?
LORELAI: Well, I just -- as long as she's coming.
CHRISTOPHER: So you said snails?
LORELAI: Well I had to say something.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, at least we have a plan now. We'll sit her down in the kitchen, feed her snails, and tell her we got married. [Chuckles]
LORELAI: Oh, my god. [Sighs] I just hate that she doesn't know.
CHRISTOPHER: Well she's gonna know tonight when we tell her.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Lor?
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: She's gonna be happy…
LORELAI: [Chuckles]
CHRISTOPHER: Her parents just got married. It's the dream.
LORELAI: Yeah. Maybe I should tell her by myself.
CHRISTOPHER: Together -- we agreed. We're gonna tell her together.
LORELAI: Yeah No, you're right, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm just so used to it just being me and her. I'll feel better when she knows.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, she'll know tonight when we tell her...
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: With snails.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] Now we have to get snails.
CHRISTOPHER: We'll find snails.
LORELAI: Where do you get snails.
CHRISTOPHER: Maybe Doose's has snails.
LORELAI: Doose's doesn't have snails.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, then, we'll go to a snail store -- emporium. We'll find snails.
LORELAI: And a recipe.
CHRISTOPHER: They will have a recipe at the snail emporium.
LORELAI: Really?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
LORELAI: All right.
OPENING CREDITS
LOGAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - ELEVATOR
[The doors opens, Rory is on the phone, she gets out and walks along the hall to the apartment.]
LOGAN: So you really liked the chamber music?
RORY: The part I was awake for, anyway. And then, after that, we went to see a basketball game.
LOGAN: Slightly less obscure.
RORY: Yeah right, a lot of people seem to be into the sports thing. And I can see why -- the fast pace, the school spirit.
LOGAN: You liked it?
RORY: Again, the part I was awake for.
LOGAN: Wow, a real basketball fan, huh?
[Enters the apartment]
RORY: Ah! Oh, my god!
LOGAN: [Chuckles]
RORY: What is wrong with you!
LOGAN: You're not happy to see me.
RORY: Well, of course I am, but why do you insist on scaring me half to death every time you're in town?
LOGAN: Well besides the fact that it's really fun -- well, actually, that's it. It's just really fun.
RORY: Oh man just once, you could call me and tell me you're coming home, like a normal person. Normal's boring. Normal's overrated. Normal's not why you love me.
[They kiss]
RORY: So, what's going on? Why are you here?
LOGAN: You know that space we've been trying to book for our launch party?
RORY: The orchid room.
LOGAN: Yeah, the problem is, it's booked till like 2008, or it was until Nadine Maybrooke broke up with Jamie Erman, thus canceling their engagement party and freeing the space up tonight.
RORY: Poor Nadine and Jamie.
LOGAN: Hey, I invited them. The more the merrier, it's gonna be hugh.
RORY: So, you're having your launch party tonight.
LOGAN: Well, actually, it's our prelaunch launch party. Our launch party will take more than 48 hours to plan. It starts at 9:00. You can be there, right?
RORY: Oh yeah I'm having dinner with my parents, but I can stop by right after.
LORELAI: When did they get back from France?
RORY: Last night. I would just skip it, but my mom really wants to see me and, apparently, make me snails.
LOGAN: Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you post-snails. It should be a pretty good time. We've got a huge guest list. Bobbi's pulled out all the stops. She's she's contracted five of the hottest P.R. Agents in the city and has them hunkered in a w*r room. I'd be surprised if she lets them take bathroom breaks.
RORY: hum you can't stop Bobbi.
LOGAN: Ace.
RORY: What, no, I like Bobbi. I do. I don't like the fact that she's not a big, swarthy dude. But I recognize that my issues with Bobbi have nothing to do with her. She's lovely, she's you colleague It doesn't matter that her legs come up to my nose.
LOGAN: "A big, swarthy dude"?
RORY: With a cheesy goatee.
LOGAN: Well, maybe she'll agree to the goatee. And, hey, you want to come with me tomorrow and check out apartments?
RORY: Apartment, like, to live in?
LOGAN: I know it is cliché, but, yes, I intend to live in my apartment.
RORY: In Manhattan?
LOGAN: Unless I strike you as a Staten island kind of guy.
RORY: You're moving to New York…
LORELAI: Pretty much.
RORY: Which is an hour away?
LOGAN: Actually an hour and 20 minutes.
RORY: That's so much closer than London!
LOGAN: You've been brushing up on your geography hu?
RORY: No I just can't believe it. I mean, it's huge. It's amazing. I…
LOGAN: Are you happy?
RORY: I'm so happy!
[They hug]
LOGAN: Come on. Let's get something to drink.
RORY: But why do you have to get your own apartment, why can't you just live here with me?
LOGAN: I'd love to, ace, but I think I'd end up seeing more of the I-95 than I would of you. I mean my hours are gonna be crazy. If I live near the office, I can crawl home at 3:00 in the morning and crawl back to work at 7:00.
RORY: That's a lot of crawling.
LOGAN: It just doesn't make sense logistically.
RORY: So it's just gonna be me here?
LOGAN: Well you were gonna live here by yourself anyway.
RORY: I know, but if you're gonna have your whole new apartment, then you're gonna need all your stuff.
LOGAN: Don't worry I'm not gonna clean you out, ace.
RORY: I'll be fine. Take your stuff.
LOGAN: It's not gonna happen, new apartment, new stuff.
RORY: Really?
LOGAN: Yeah. I-I want a fresh start.
RORY: Hey well I mean, you should take some of your stuff, like your favorite stuff.
LOGAN: Like what?
RORY: Like, you know, you can't live without your suit of armor, can you? I mean you really want to take that.
LOGAN: You don't like Henry?
RORY: Well it's not that I don't like Henry it's just that he creeps me out.
LOGAN: Oh man now you just hurt Henry's feelings.
RORY: Well he's gonna have to grow a little tougher chain mail then if he's gonna make it on the mean streets of New York.
LOGAN: You're heartless, Gilmore.
LUKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
LUKE: You hungry?
APRIL: Uh-huh.
LUKE: You want some juice?
APRIL: Uh-huh.
LUKE: Notice my hair is green?
APRIL: Uh-huh. Uh, hey?
LUKE: Dinners ready.
APRIL: Five more minutes?
LUKE: After dinner -- wash your hands. So what's so interesting, anyway?
APRIL: Hyperphagia.
LUKE: Oh, right. Cool.
APRIL: That's just a fancy term for overeating. It's what bears do in preparation for hibernation.
LUKE: Oh hey did I tell you about the time I saw a grizzly bear on a camping trip?
APRIL: Are you serious?
LUKE: 500 pounds, easy. [putting dinner on the table] Turkey burgers, sweet potato fries, broccoli.
APRIL: Thanks. So, what did you do?
LUKE: Just backed away real slow, avoided eye contact -- that's how you show you're submissive.
APRIL: Really?
LUKE: Yeah it's all about body language. And you've got to try to stay calm.
APRIL: Hm. Were you?
LUKE: No.
APRIL: I forgot to tell you what happened with Rachel today.
LUKE: Did she apologize to Melissa? Are they talking again?
APRIL: Yeah, but they won't be as soon as Melissa finds out that Rachel asked Joanna to come with her to Florida to visit her grandparents.
LUKE: [Nods to agree]
APRIL: Did you remember to wash my jean skirt?
LUKE: It's hanging in the bathroom.
APRIL: Cool I want to wear it to Sabrina's party. I was going to wear that purple dress, but last time I wore it, Adam called me "Purple Nardini" all day.
LUKE: [Nods to agree]
APRIL: Yeah, it's a pretty uninspired insult, but the way he said it was so annoying. And now, since he knows it bugs me, he's probably just gonna keep saying it all night.
LUKE: "All night"?
APRIL: At Sabrina's party.
LUKE: Why would Adam be at her party?
APRIL: Because he was invited.
LUKE: To Sabrina's birthday?
APRIL: Well, yeah.
LUKE: Wait Sabrina's a girl, right?
APRIL: Yeah.
LUKE: And Adam's a boy?
APRIL: Yeah.
LUKE: And he'll be at her party?
APRIL: Yeah, it's a boy-girl party.
LUKE: What's that mean?
APRIL: [moving the salt and pepper as she talks] Well it means there will both be boys... and girls at the party.
LUKE: Yeah. All right. I just didn't know you were going to boy-girl parties, that's all.
APRIL: Well It's my first one. I only got invited 'cause Sabrina's parents made her invite the whole class. But I'm not about to look a gift horse in the mouth.
LUKE: So, you're mom's okay with you going to a boy-girl party?
APRIL: Of course. I'm 13.
LUKE: So, um, listen. This is probably a stupid question, but... is there gonna be kissing at this party?
APRIL: Okay! Ew, dad!
LUKE: What?
APRIL: Oh, gross!
LUKE: What's gross -- kissing?
APRIL: No, you talking about kissing.
LUKE: What? All right, all right, I won't say "kissing."
APRIL: Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew! Stop! Stop!
LUKE: All right! I-I'm not saying it at all. Done -- new topic. I promise.
APRIL: The fries are really good.
LUKE: Good, good. Then eat your broccoli, too.
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory comes in the front door and if greeted buy Lorelai]
RORY: Hello?!
LORELAI: [Gasps] Honey! Oh, hi! [She kiss Rory in both cheeks] That's how we do it on the continent.
RORY: But of course. Hey, dad.
CHRISTOPHER: Hi, honey. [They hug]
LORELAI: Come on. Come in! Come in!
RORY: What are you wearing?
LORELAI: I hear it's called an apron.
RORY: Interesting why are you wearing that?
LORELAI: Well because I've been cooking snails…
RORY: You're kidding me.
LORELAI: Been cooking snails and dealing with snail spatter.
RORY: [Too Chris] She really cook those?
CHRISTOPHER: She really did.
LORELAI: What do you mean I told you I was gonna cook them.
RORY: Yeah but I thought it was just like a euphemism.
LORELAI: A euphemism for what?
RORY: A euphemism for "I'm ordering a pizza."
CHRISTOPHER: Come sit, sit.
RORY: So, how was your trip?
LORELAI: Oh, no. First, a glass of wine -- we went to the Chateau Du Nozet in the Loire valley, and this is Pouilly Fumé. It's supposed to be one of the best in the land, and after trying 10 varietals -- note the use of "varietal"...
RORY: Noted.
LORELAI: ...Believe me, you tend to believe them.
CHRISTOPHER: We were drunk by the end of the tour, we bought a case.
RORY: Cool so you went to a winery? What else, what else did you do?
LORELAI: Um, here. Try a snail.
RORY: Uh, no.
LORELAI: Please? Come on. I made them.
RORY: You try one.
LORELAI: I'm full i've been snacking on them all day.
RORY: Well see and I had a lunch of bugs and lizards, so I'm good, too.
CHRISTOPHER: All right you know what, I'll try one.
RORY: You sure you don't want a lime and some salt so you can do it like a tequila sh*t?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm good. All right, you ready? One, two...
RORY: Well, how's it taste?
LORELAI: Well.
CHRISTOPHER: Sort of like a buttered gummi bear.
RORY: Pass. So, what else? Tell me -- France.
LORELAI: Okay, here it is. Um... while we were in France, your dad and I -- we got married.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: We got married.
RORY: You got married married?
LORELAI: Married married.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: [Nods]
RORY: Um... wow. Wow. Um... hey, congratulations. T-that's -- that's so great.
CHRISTOPHER: Thanks. We're so excited.
RORY: Um, how? When?
LORELAI: UM…
CHRISTOPHER: Two days ago, in Giverny. It's about an hour outside Paris. It's where Monet had his studio, where he painted the water lilies.
RORY: Oh, so y-you guys just went there to get married?
LORELAI: Oh, no, we just went there to walk around, to see the lilies. And, um, then it started raining, and there was this little church, and, uh...
CHRISTOPHER: It was so beautiful, and we were so happy, and we got married.
RORY: Wow.
CHRISTOPHER: The ceremony was in French, so there's only a 90% chance that we're actually married. There's a 10% chance we were issued a very expensive dog license.
RORY: Wow. Wow. Um... oh, I'm -- I'm so happy for you guys.
LORELAI: Really?
CHRISTOPHER: You know, we need champagne.
LORELAI: Yes.
CHRISTOPHER: Do we have champagne?
LORELAI: Uh, in the c-cooler in the garage, maybe.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: I'll be right back.
LORELAI: Okay! [Sighs as the door closes] Well?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: What do you think?
RORY: Um, what do you mean?
LORELAI: I mean, what do you think?
RORY: I don't know, mom. I can't believe that you did this.
LORELAI: You're mad?
RORY: Yes, I'm mad.
LORELAI: Rory...
RORY: Just stop, okay? Don't.
LORELAI: Okay, but…
RORY: I can't do this right now. Because Dad is about to come back in here, and I just can't.
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: Unfortunately, we went all the way to France and didn't come back with a bottle of champagne, so we're gonna have to make do with California's finest.
RORY: It's okay.
[Lorelai looks at Rory as the cork pops]
PRE-LAUNCH PARTY
[Rory enters]
FEMALE GUEST: [talking to another guest] And she showed me her ring, this huge canary diamond. Looked like something Paris Hilton would wear.
LOGAN: Hey, you made it.
RORY: I made it.
LOGAN: You look beautiful. [They kiss] How was dinner did your mom really make snails?
RORY: Well not only did she make snails, she got married.
LOGAN: What?
RORY: In France -- to my dad.
LOGAN: Wow.
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: Wow!
RORY: I know.
LOGAN: How do you feel about it?
RORY: Ah you mean besides really bad?
LOGAN: Well do you want a drink?
RORY: No, I'm good for now.
LOGAN: Let's go outside and talk about it.
RORY: Um no, I'm okay. I mean I will want to talk about it, but right now I'm still processing.
LOGAN: Well it's a lot to process, don't feel like you have to stay if you don't want to.
RORY: Oh, no. I want to be here.
LOGAN: Are you sure?
RORY: Yeah, little-known fact -- I am quite the compartmentalizer. In fact, I have a blister on my heel. I've been ignoring it all evening.
LOGAN: Alright well if you change your mind, you want to talk about it...
RORY: I'm fine, this is your night. So how can I help?
LOGAN: Just be your charming, blister-ignoring self.
RORY: I can do that. So, who's here? Or, rather, who's not here?
LOGAN: Yeah we got a pretty good turnout, huh?
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: Alright see that guy right there? He's a Rockefeller. He doesn't like you to talk about the fact, that he's a Rockefeller but we wants you to know he's a Rockefeller. So if you talk to him make sure he knows you know, but don't say you know.
RORY: I'm gonna try to work in the phrase "standard oil."
LOGAN: Behind us – Boykin and his fiancée, Celery. And, no, I'm not kidding. Those are their real names.
RORY: Un here "Meet my boyfriend, Boykin." Try saying that five times fast.
PHILLIP: Rory, you made it!
[They kiss on both cheeks.]
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: Hey.
NICK: Hey, Rory.
RORY: Hi.
PHILLIP: You look beautiful, absolutely beautiful.
NICK: Careful man you're drooling.
PHILLIP: How are things at Yale? Only six months until you're sprung free, right?
RORY: Yeah. Don't remind me. I'm so not ready to be sprung.
PHILLIP: Oh stop you'll be brilliant. Can I get you a drink?
RORY: Oh, thanks.
PHILLIP: I'll be back.
BOBBI: Hello, Rory, darling.
RORY: Hi.
[They kiss on both cheeks.]
BOBBI: I'm so happy you made it. That dress is so cute.
RORY: Oh, thanks. Um, your dress is cute, too.
BOBBI: [Chuckles] Thank you, sweetheart. So, bit of exciting news -- "page six" is here.
LOGAN: Really?
RORY: Wow. Congratulations.
NICK: It's all Bobbi.
BOBBI: Oh, rubbish. Oh before I forget, you sent a case of champagne to Joe McMillan. His website's trash, but we need him to write something smashing about us.
LOGAN: Sounds good.
NICK: Damn, Oscar Schroeder's limo didn't show. I've got to find him another one, the gentleman can't be expected to walk three whole blocks.
BOBBI: Ooh, Tripp Cavanaugh?
LOGAN: Tripp! Hey, man, glad you could make it. [they shake hands] Bobbi, you know Tripp.
TRIPP: Hey sweetheart. [They kiss on both cheeks.]
LOGAN: And this is my girlfriend, Rory Gilmore.
TRIPP: Nice to meet you.
RORY: Nice to meet you to.
[He leans in to kiss Rory on the cheek]
RORY: Oh.
[Then the other]
RORY: Oh.
BOBBI: Tripp's just back from Tortola. He's building an incredible house there.
LOGAN: Wow congratulations.
TRIPP: Well we'll see construction on the island is such a joke. I mean try getting anyone to meet a schedule.
LOGAN: I've heard that.
TRIPP: Plus, my property's totally isolated, which will be great once the house is built, but it's a construction nightmare. [Logan and Rory look on like they are only half interested in what Tripp has to say] Turns out, the bridge that accesses my land can't take the weight of the truck carrying the supplies. So we had to off-load the supplies onto a smaller vehicle. That necessitated 2 forklifts, none of this is covered in the estimate, of course.
BOBBI: It never is.
TRIPP: Anyway, so we finally got the materials -- finally.
RORY: Oh, great.
TRIPP: Yeah unfortunately, that's when the real trouble began. Without consulting me they decided to move the pool over 10 feet 'cause the excavation crew needed more room for their equipment. Well of course, I flip. I mean who ever heard of a pool right in the middle of the backyard?
RORY: Well, not me.
TRIPP: Right I told them that was unacceptable and they have to move.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Can I get a picture of you guys?
BOBBI: Oh sure.
LOGAN: Absolutely.
[They move in close together, the photo is take.]
BOBBI: I've got correct names and spellings. [Goes of with the photographer.]
TRIPP: Where was I?
RORY: Um, your pool.
TRIPP: So we shifted the thing back 10 feet, thank God, but when they started digging in the right place, we found out that the soil in Tortola is far more porous than we initially thought.
LOGAN: Oh, god.
RORY: Bummer.
TRIPP: Yeah bummer is right, so we had to lay down a drainage system, or at least that was the plan. But it turns out in Tortola they have these building codes that specifically…
BOBBI: Tripp, have you met Natasha Wolfe?
TRIPP: No I don't think so.
BOBBI: Oh god you have to meet her. She has a house in Tortola, as well. Come come.
TRIPP: Will you excuse me?
LOGAN: Absolutely.
RORY: Nice meeting you.
RORY: Um, can we please never go to Tortola?
LOGAN: I don't even want to meet John Turturro.
RORY: Or eat tortellini.
LOGAN: Hey, you'll actually like this guy. Hugo.
HUGO: Logan. Hey. How you doing, man?
LOGAN: Not to bad, this is my girlfriend, Rory Gilmore.
HUGO: Hey Hugo Grace, nice to meet you.
RORY: You to.
LOGAN: Hugo spent two years working at the New York Times, another couple at Slate, and then the Paris Review under George Plimpton.
RORY: Wow did you just worship at his feet?
HUGO: I tried, but he kept telling me to get off the ground.
LOGAN: Hugo's starting a new online magazine -- lots of buzz.
HUGO: It could mean nothing.
LOGAN: Could mean something.
HUGO: See why I like this guy?
RORY: You don't have to convince me.
LOGAN: Rory's the editor of the Yale Daily News.
RORY: I was the editor I just abdicated my throne -- or, rather, my swivel chair.
HUGO: That's impressive.
PHILLIP: Your drink -- sorry it got waylaid. [Too Logan] Need you help buddy, Dan Cryer's about one drink away from hitting on Jerrickson's wife.
LOGAN: That would be bad. [The group laughs] Excuse me.
HUGO: Hey I'm gonna monopolize you a little bit longer. If you don't mind, once you find somebody that can talk about something other than stock quotes at one of these things, you kinda hold on for dear life.
RORY: Oh God I know what you mean.
HUGO: It's pretty different from parties at Yale?
RORY: Fewer drunken musings on Roland Barthes. Although, on the plus side, I am learning a great deal about the tackiness of the canary diamond.
HUGO: They're not teaching that these days? Tell me they at least have a course in piloting the family jet.
RORY: Sadly, no.
HUGO: Man, no wonder we're falling behind the Japanese. Is it the Chinese now? I know we're definitely falling behind someone. So ah, what kind of pieces you write at Yale?
RORY: Um a little bit of everything, that's the great thing about being editor -- you can pretty much give yourself the best pieces. I got to interview Barack Obama a couple weeks ago. He came to speak at campus
HUGO: Really? Did you ask you buddy Barack if he's gonna run in 2008?
RORY: Well what kind of journalist would I be if I didn't?
HUGO: And?
RORY: Standard answer -- "no current plans." But I saw a twinkle in his eye.
HUGO: Well, you can't quote a twinkle.
RORY: But you can describe it.
HUGO: Good point. Hey, listen. If you want to submit something to my site, I'd be happy to take a look at it.
RORY: Really? Wow that would be great, what kind of pieces are you looking for?
HUGO: Ah ,cultural and social observations. We're sort of Slate meets New York Times' "lifestyle" section, before they sold out.
RORY: Ha-ha cool.
HUGO: You can definitely write about a party like this.
RORY: Really.
LOGAN: [Coming back] I got Cryer talking golf -- disaster averted.
RORY: Good job.
HUGO: Oh listen I've got to take off, man. I got an early morning.
LOGAN: All right, man. Thanks a lot for coming out. I really appreciate it.
HUGO: No thank you. It was nice to meet you, Rory.
RORY: You to.
HUGO: And here's my card. There you go.
RORY: Thanks.
HUGO: We'll see you guys around
RORY: Bye.
LOGAN: Thanks. Look at you, getting a card.
RORY: I know, he said I should submit a piece for him, like something about this party.
LOGAN: Seriously you have to do it.
RORY: I know. I am.
TRIPP: Logan, Rory I am so sorry I got pulled away. Natasha Wolfe actually has a house on another one of the beef islands. No Tortola. Still, she had an interesting experience when she was building.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR
[Lorelai is in her cell phone]
LORELAI: Okay, I'm just gonna leave you one more message, and then I'm gonna start sending telegrams. [Sighs] Honey, I-I know you think this marriage was a big step, and... and it seems impulsive to you, and we talked about going slow, and this seems like the opposite of slow. And, in some ways, it is. And, in some ways, it really isn't. And I really want to talk to you about it. So, please, call me back... or respond to any of my forthcoming telegrams. Okay. Bye-bye.



LOGAN'S APARTMENT
RORY: I don't know I think the piece is good. I was just on a roll. You know I mean, I was hopped up. I couldn't sleep. I was just way too excited, and I drank way too much coffee -- way too much coffee. Oh, I should, I should really stop talking and let you finish reading.
[Rory's cell phone beeps. "one new message"]
LORELAI: Okay, I'm just gonna leave you one more message…
[Rory ends the message and puts the phone down]
RORY: So... what do you think?
LOGAN: I don't know what to say.
RORY: Oh, yeah I know the ending is a little convoluted, but I…
LOGAN: It's not convoluted. You made your feelings perfectly clear.
RORY: What do you mean.
LOGAN: Just that it must have been really hard for you at my party, surrounded by all those people with -- how do you put it? "Who can no more imagine a world without trust funds than a world without water -- imported and bubbly, of course."
RORY: Oh no that was meant to be funny…
LOGAN: It sounds like it was torturous, being stuck there with "these overprivileged sons and daughters of somebodies "who fail to grasp how out of touch they seem "to those of us who don't have an errant domestic employee or a construction problem on beef island."
RORY: You're mad?
LOGAN: You're damn right I'm mad.
RORY: But you were making fun of these people all night.
LOGAN: I joking I wasn't standing there judging everyone.
RORY: I didn't judge everyone.
LOGAN: The title is "Let Them Drink Cosmos." I was joking with my girlfriend. I wasn't comparing a whole class of people to Marie Antoinette.
RORY: I'm so I really didn't think that this would upset you.
LOGAN: You didn't think it would upset me?
RORY: No, no. I was just writing. I mean I was worked up. I was mad at my mom. Maybe that kind of got into the piece somehow. But, no, this was meant to be funny. I didn't think you would take it personally. I mean you're totally different from these people.
LOGAN: No, I'm not, and you know what I don't want to be.
RORY: Logan…
LOGAN: What I'm a rich trust-fund kid. I'm not ashamed of it.
RORY: No and you shouldn't be. That's not what I meant. I mean, the point or the point I was trying to make was that people use connections to get ahead.
LOGAN: Oh give me a break, you act like making connections is something nefarious. It's just people meeting people.
RORY: Well, it's certain people meeting certain people. It's not like anyone's meeting Joe bus driver.
LOGAN: And you're Joe bus driver.
RORY: Well, no, but…
LOGAN: Exactly, I mean where do you get off acting all morally superior?
RORY: That is not what I intended to say at all.
LOGAN: You clearly think you are. Why? Because you read "Ironweed"? 'Cause you saw "Norma Rae"?
RORY: Logan…
LOGAN: Wake up Rory whether you like it or not, you're one of us. You went to prep school. You go to Yale. Your grandparents are building a whole damn astronomy building in your name.
RORY: That is different, okay? It's not like I live off a $5-million trust fund my parents set up for me.
LOGAN: Yeah well, you're not exactly paying rent, either.
RORY: [Scoffs] Screw you, Logan.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke is washing dishes]
LUKE: So you're getting ready for the party, huh?
APRIL: Yep.
LUKE: I can get you some real wrapping paper.
APRIL: Did you not see "An Inconvenient Truth"?
LUKE: Are you okay?
APRIL: Yeah, I just have a little stomachache that's all.
LUKE: [Sounding a little worried] Yeah.
APRIL: Okay what do you think. I put this article on Darfur on the front, you know to put things in perspective in case Sabrina doesn't like the CD that I picked out for her.
LUKE: Oh that's looks pretty good. So, I wanted to talk to you about tonight. [April holds her side] Hey, are you sure you're okay? Maybe you should get something to eat.
APRIL: I'm not hungry. Hand me the tape, please.
LUKE: Sweetie, you don't look so good.
APRIL: Well that's not a nice thing to say to someone who's on her way to her first boy-girl party.
LUKE: Oh yeah, sorry.
APRIL: Tape please…
LUKE: So, look, about the party.
APRIL: Yeah? [reaches for the tape]
LUKE: I want to talk to you about that thing we were talking about the other night. I'm not gonna use the "k" word, okay? Instead, I'll just use "juggiling," okay?
APRIL: "Juggiling"?
LUKE: "Juggiling"
APRIL: Okay.
LUKE: Okay, so here's the thing. Even if all the other kids are juggiling and you might feel like you want to juggile, too, I don't think you should juggile before you're ready.
APRIL: I know.
LUKE: And I don't think you're ready.
APRIL: How do you know?
LUKE: Well let's put it this way. I'm not ready.
APRIL: Well that seems arbitrary, since you're not the one doing it.
LUKE: Yeah, it may be, but, still, if I let you go to this party, you have to promise me that you won't juggile with boys.
APRIL: Fine.
LUKE: "Fine"?
APRIL: Yes. Fine.
LUKE: Okay.
APRIL: [Sighs] sh**t, where'd I put Sabrina's card?
LUKE: Oh I…
APRIL: Oh, there it is. [Sighs]
LUKE: Hey, are you sure you're okay?
APRIL: I feel fine.
LUKE: Here let me feel your forehead.
APRIL: I feel fine.
LUKE: Y-- April, you have a fever.
APRIL: I swear, dad, I feel fine.
LUKE: You can't go to the party if you're sick.
APRIL: I'm not sick!
LUKE: Yeah, you are, sweetie.
APRIL: You just don't want me to go!
LUKE: That's not true.
APRIL: It is! You don't trust me!
LUKE: Of course I do. Look there will be other parties.
APRIL: NO!
LUKE: I'm sorry, April. You're sick.
APRIL: I'm not!
LUKE: Yeah, you are, sweetie.
APRIL: I can go!
LUKE: No, you can't. [goes off to her bed]
APRIL: You suck as a dad!
LUKE: [Sits down a sighs]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai at the answering machine]
ANSWERING MACHINE: You have no messages.
CHRISTOPHER: I think this is the last of the clothes.
LORELAI: Oh yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Uh-um.
LORELAI: Aah! Come here. What is that?
CHRISTOPHER: What? It's a shirt. What's wrong with a shirt?
LORELAI: Let's start with the color. It's peach.
CHRISTOPHER: I look good in peach.
LORELAI: Exactly. Men who buy peach shirts buy it ‘cause think they look good in peach, which means they really thought about it, which means they're obsessed with their looks!
CHRISTOPHER: I'm not obsessed with my looks!
LORELAI: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you a peach shirt.
CHRISTOPHER: Alright just leave my stuff alone.
LORELAI: Oh, my god, you dirty thief.
CHRISTOPHER: Excuse me?
LORELAI: You stinking, lying, stinking, ratty, dirty thief!
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: This is my Police "Synchronicity" t-shirt. I have been missing this for 22 years! I asked you if you had it! I looked you right in the face, and you denied it!
CHRISTOPHER: I lied.
LORELAI: Oh, you lied! You lied! [Chris laughs] Do you know how long I looked for this?! Days and days and then I accused my mother of throwing it out, and she said she didn't, and, oh, my god, I hated her. Oh my god I could have had the best relationship with my mother if only you hadn't stolen my shirt. Well, keep laughing, buddy, because, I'll tell you, the laugh's on you now! You better get used to seeing this shirt, because I have to make up for 22 years of not wearing it. Where do you think you're going?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm dropping this stuff off in Rory's room. Actual I guess it's Gigi's room now. Wow, that's weird, huh?
LORELAI: Really weird.
CHRISTOPHER: A big selling point -- the proximity of this room to the kitchen. I don't know why but Gigi was incredibly psyched about that.
LORELAI: Why? You feed her, don't you, Hmm?
CHRISTOPHER: I knew there was something I was forgetting. [Chris moves a lap off the desk]
LORELAI: Wow what are you doing?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm just seeing how heavy it is, Thought maybe we could move it in the garage, get Gigi's coloring table in here.
LORELAI: Yes, or we could just leave it right here.
CHRISTOPHER: Nah, Gigi's not gonna need it for a couple years. Oh you know what I was thinking, trundle beds.
LORELAI: Trundle beds?
CHRISTOPHER: For when Rory comes to visit.
LORELAI: Uh, okay. Wait. I'm sorry. Slow down.
CHRISTOPHER: Why?
LORELAI: Um... I just -- I don't want to change Rory's room all around without consulting her.
CHRISTOPHER: She's not gonna care. She's graduating in the spring.
LORELAI: Right and lots of college graduates end up back home, where they need their desks.
CHRISTOPHER: Lor.
LORELAI: What I'm just being realistic. Okay it's not like she's gonna be an investment banker. You know she's gonna be a journalist, and journalists get paid crap.
CHRISTOPHER: So if she needs money, we'll help her out.
LORELAI: Right. Okay. That's fine. But, still, why not just leave Rory's room as it is? Give Gigi something to aspire to. Things worked out pretty well for Rory. I mean, she went to Yale.
CHRISTOPHER: Lor...
LORELAI: Chris?
CHRISTOPHER: I know it's difficult, but things around here are gonna change.
LORELAI: You think I don't know that? I just, uh... I don't want Rory to feel like the rug's being pulled out from under her, you know, like she's being kicked out.
CHRISTOPHER: Rory's gonna be fine.
LORELAI: You don't know that. She's already upset.
CHRISTOPHER: About what?
LORELAI: About you and me, about the marriage.
CHRISTOPHER: She seemed fine when we told her.
LORELAI: In front of you, and then you left, and... [Sighs] ...She told me she was really upset.
CHRISTOPHER: What? H-how could you not tell me that?
LORELAI: Well, honey, I…
CHRISTOPHER: No, I'm her father, Lorelai. We're married now.
LORELAI: Okay, well, I'm telling you now. [Sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: Let's call her. We should talk about it.
LORELAI: I did.
CHRISTOPHER: And?
LORELAI: And she's not answering right now. But it'll be okay, you know? It'll be fine. It's just -- it's a sensitive thing, and, uh... and I-I just feel like we should give it time, you know, before we spring trundle beds on her.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, okay.
LORELAI: I mean she just needs time to adjust.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay?
CHRISTOPHER: There's a few more things I got to bring in from the car.
[Lorelai places the lamp back on the desk how it was]
OLIVIA AND LUCY'S APARTMENT
RORY: He's the one who insisted I move in with him, begged me practically and now he throws it back in my face, like I'm some kind of leech.
LUCY: That's such a low blow.
RORY: So low. Uh I hate everyone today.
OLIVIA: Including us?
RORY: Well no, not you guys, but don't cross me, sister.
LUCY: Keep reading, Liv.
RORY: I'm practically homeless. Obviously, I can't live there.
LUCY: You can move in with us.
RORY: Is that allowed?
LUCY: Well not technically.
OLIVIA: But we have a hot plate, and we're not allowed to have that either.
LUCY: Will you finish reading that article so I can read it?
OLIVIA: Okay, okay.
LUCY: Seriously Rory, you should just move in here with us. We'll make a smaller common room. We'll put up a temporary wall.
RORY: You know how to do that?
LUCY: I don't, but boyfriend's super handy.
RORY: Oh, right.
LUCY: He put up those bookshelves, and they're fine for, you know, paperbacks.
RORY: You know what don't worry about me you guys are taking enough of a risk with that hot plate. I will figure something out.
LUCY: Well, if you need to...
RORY: Yeah. Thanks.
OLIVIA: Here. [Hand Lucy the article.]
RORY: So, what did you think?
OLIVIA: It's a really great piece.
RORY: You think.
OLIVIA: Yeah you're an awesome writer.
RORY: Thanks.
OLIVIA: It was sharp and funny, and I could totally see everything and imagine everyone.
RORY: Thanks. And it's not mean, right?
OLIVIA: No, no, it's mean.
LUCY: Yeah, it is mean, and I'm only on the first paragraph.
OLIVIA: Keep reading it gets meaner.
RORY: It's mean?
OLIVIA: Sort of Lynn Hirshberg meets -- I don't know, someone really mean.
RORY: What? No! No, I'm Fran Lebowitz. It's supposed to be fun, frothy, lighthearted satire, social anthropology. I'm Tama Janowitz.
OLIVIA: A mean Tama Janowitz.
RORY: Oh, god. I'm mean? I'm mean and judgmental, and I didn't even mean to be. I was just trying to sell an article. Well no wonder he's upset.
OLIVIA: Come on! He knows you. It wasn't intentional.
RORY: That's worse! I didn't even mean to be mean, and I was mean, mean and judgmental and insensitive. I really do hate everyone today, including myself. Great. The circle's complete.
LUKE'S APARTMENT
LUKE: You sure you don't want some ginger ale? It'll settle your stomach.
APRIL: I feel fine.
LUKE: Okay. How about a movie? I could rent us a movie. Come on, April. Look I know you're a little upset. But, I promise you, there will be other parties.
APRIL: [Groans]
LUKE: Come on, talk to me. [Sighs, feels Aprils forehead] Wow! Okay, you're really hot, sweetie. Hang on a minute.
[Goes to the phone and dials a number]
LORELAI: Hello?
LUKE: Yeah April's really sick, and I don't know what to do. She's got a fever, and it's her stomach. And she's really pale so I don't…
LORELAI: Okay. Slow down. Did she throw up?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Did she eat something bad?
LUKE: No she hasn't eaten all day.
LORELAI: Aw, where does it hurt?
LUKE: She's holding her side.
LORELAI: Which side?
LUKE: Her right side. It seems to be getting worse.
LORELAI: Oh wow it could be appendicitis.
LUKE: Appendicitis -- really?
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah it's gonna be okay, but you should take her right to the hospital. Take her to St. Joseph's.
LUKE: Okay. Okay.
ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL – WAITING ROOM
[A man and woman sitting behind look are talking]
WOMAN: We have five minutes left.
MAN: No, we don't.
WOMAN: I checked my watch before I fed the meter.
MAN: So did I.
WOMAN: You couldn't have because we've got five minutes left.
NAM: No we don't.
LUKE: [Sounding annoyed] Five minutes have passed since you started this inane conversation. So if I were you I'd put another quarter in and call it a day!
WOMAN: You need to check your watch battery.
MAN: Check my watch? This is a Quartz Timex. You wind it.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Hey.
LUKE: Oh, hey. Hi.
LORELAI: How is she?
LUKE: Okay. It was appendicitis, like you said. But she's okay. I mean the operation went really great. They got it out, no problem. And she's gonna be fine. And I'm gonna be able to see her pretty soon.
LORELAI: Good, good.
LUKE: Yeah you didn't -- you know you didn't have to come, but thanks for coming.
LORELAI: There's nothing worse than taking your kid to the emergency room. You know I remember Rory had food poisoning, and they had to hook her up to an I.V. And she just looked so little and scared. It made me feel like they were gonna have to hook me up to an I.V.
LUKE: I was almost out of my mind, I was so scared. I mean at one point, I got so panicked, I was thinking maybe I'd give her my appendix, you know if they could do some kind of a transplant or something. But I was a little out of my mind.
LORELAI: Well, I'm glad she's gonna be okay.
LUKE: She's gonna be alright…
DOCTOR: Mr. And Mrs. Nardini?
LUKE: Oh, no. Hi, I'm Luke Danes. I'm April's dad.
DOCTOR: Well, she's a little out of it right now, but you and your wife can go in and see her.
LUKE: No, she's not my...
LORELAI: No, I'm not, uh...
[Luke see the wedding ring on Lorelai's finger]
DOCTOR: Oh. Sorry. I just assumed. [pause] So, would both of you like to go in and...
LUKE: I'll just...
LORELAI: You go.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay.
LUKE: All right.
[Lorelai looks at her wedding ring and leaves]
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Logan is on his cell phone]
LOGAN: Trust me. Don't call him today. He's going to put his money down. He just doesn't like the aggressive stuff. We have to sit back, relax, let him come to us. If we don't hear from him in a week, then we panic. [Rory comes home] Yeah. Nick, I got to call you back. All right. Bye. [Hangs up] Sorry. [Sighs] I hope it's okay that I'm here.
RORY: Hey, it's your apartment.
LOGAN: Rory [Sighs] I'm so sorry I said that.
RORY: Yeah, well...
LOGAN: I was way out of line. I just…I love it that you're here. You know that I love it that you're here.
RORY: Yeah. No, I know.
LOGAN: I was just upset.
RORY: Well, you had every right to be. That article was awful.
LOGAN: It wasn't awful.
RORY: It was awful and mean and judgmental, as you said. I just, I don't even know why I didn't see that or what I was thinking, except that maybe I wasn't thinking.
LOGAN: Look it's okay.
RORY: No, it's not okay. I was just trying to write a clever article, and I didn't mean to upset you, but I should have thought about it. I should have know.
LOGAN: But if that's the way you feel...
RORY: But that's just it. It's not the way I feel.
LOGAN: You don't have to approve of everything I do.
RORY: I know that, but I actually do. I mean I have total respect for everything that you're doing. I'm so proud of you.
LOGAN: I know you are.
RORY: Do you? Because I really need you to know that.
LOGAN: I really know.
RORY: Because I really am.
LOGAN: I know.
RORY: Promise?
LOGAN: I promise, and look the truth is, I wouldn't be so upset if you weren't such a good writer. I mean, talk about the pen being mightier than the sword. It's true that pen of yours is a howitzer.
RORY: You don't have to say that.
LOGAN: I wouldn't if it wasn't true.
RORY: Can we talk about something besides the article?
LOGAN: Hey you got to compliment me. Let me compliment you.
RORY: We're complimenting each other now?
LOGAN: If you'll let me.
RORY: I guess that's okay.
LOGAN: [Chuckles] You're a really great writer, ace.
RORY: You have great hair.
LOGAN: You've got awesome teeth. I've always admired your teeth.
RORY: Really? I never knew.
LOGAN: Yep, particularly the bottom ones.
RORY: I love you so much.
LOGAN: I love you, too.
[They kiss]
RORY: Um, but here's the thing. I have to move out of this apartment.
LOGAN: No, you don't.
RORY: Yes, I do. I always thought that you would come back and live here. But now that you're getting your own place nearby, it's just different.
LOGAN: No, it's not.
RORY: Yes, it is. It's just something I have to do for me. But you should know that I plan on taking Henry with me.
[Knock on door]
LOGAN: You'll have to take that up with him. You did insult him earlier.
RORY: Did I? Hmm.
[Logan answers the door]
LOGAN: Hey.
LORELAI: Hi. I'm sorry. I would have buzzed up, but Um, I saw a delivery guy coming in, so I slipped in with him. Boy, they sure do eat well over in 4-F. Can I come in?
LOGAN: Oh, yeah. Sure. Come on in.
RORY: What are you doing here?
LORELAI: [Sighs] Well, I just -- I wanted to see you.
LOGAN: Look, I got to run out and take care of a few things. Good to see you, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Thanks. Good to see you. [Logan leaves] I'm guessing your cell phone's not broken, huh?
RORY: I just didn't feel much like talking.
LORELAI: I know. Look I know you're upset. I know this seems sudden and like we didn't think it through. And in a way, it was impulsive. But in other ways, it's been 20 years in the making.
RORY: That's not why I'm upset. I'm glad you're married.
LORELAI: You're glad?
RORY: Yes, I'm -- I'm happy for you. It's wonderful.
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: Yeah. You're great together. You love each other. I mean It's every kid's dream, right? Parents get back together. But I wasn't there.
LORELAI: You weren't there.
RORY: I should have been there when you got married.
LORELAI: Yes, you should have been there.
RORY: I mean how would you feel if I got married and you weren't there?
LORELAI: Awful, I would feel awful.
RORY: I feel awful.
LORELAI: Look I'm sorry. You know, I -- of course I wanted you to be there.
RORY: I could have been there. All you had to do was make one phone call. You could have picked up the phone and said, "come to Paris," and I would have come to Paris.
LORELAI: I know that and I did I wanted to call you. But then I thought, if I called you, then you'd want to talk about it, and I'd have to explain. And then maybe I would talk myself out of it. I mean after everything that happened with the engagement, I didn't want a debate. I just wanted to do it, because I am so certain, Rory. I'm so certain that this is right. I really wanted to be married to your dad, and I didn't want to talk my way out of it. I just wanted to do it.
RORY: Well I wouldn't have tried to stop you. I wouldn't have tried to talk you out of it.
LORELAI: No?
RORY: No. I mean the only thing I might have said is maybe you guys would want to come back to the states to get married, so you could have some close friends there, like Sookie and Jackson, maybe grandma and grandpa, Gigi. Or maybe you would have wanted to live together for a while, like six months, just to try it out and…Yeah, I totally would have talked you out of it.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry.
RORY: No, don't be sorry. I mean, I'm really happy for you and dad. It's amazing.
LORELAI: It is amazing.
RORY: You're married.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: It's big.
LORELAI: It's big. It's a big change. But nothing's gonna change between you and me. I don't want you to feel weird.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Of course, your dad is gonna put flat-screen TVs in every room in the house, but your house is still your house. Your room is still your room, though we did talk about putting a trundle bed in there for Gigi, So it'd kind of be your room and Gigi's room, but we don't have to do that.
RORY: No I'm down with a trundle bed.
LORELAI: You are?
RORY: Yeah, I love a good trundle. I'll trundle it up with Gigi.
LORELAI: Aw
RORY: Hey, you didn't take dad's name, did you?
LORELAI: No. No. "Hayden"? No. I don't want to be Mrs. Hayden planetarium for the rest of my life. I'm Lorelai Gilmore, okay? Lorelai Gilmore without the "Gilmore" is like... Gil, you know, less. Okay.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - RORY'S/GIGI'S ROOM
[Lorelai is moving the desk]
LORELAI: [Grunts]
CHRISTOPHER: What ya doin'?
LORELAI: Hey. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up.
CHRISTOPHER: You probably shouldn't be moving furniture around at midnight, then.
LORELAI: I'm sorry. [They kiss]
CHRISTOPHER: When did you get back?
LORELAI: About half an hour ago.
CHRISTOPHER: How's April?
LORELAI: She's appendix-less, but she's gonna be okay.
CHRISTOPHER: Good.
LORELAI: I saw Luke.
CHRISTOPHER: Was it okay?
LORELAI: It was fine.
CHRISTOPHER: Good. It's good you went over.
LORELAI: But then I went to see Rory.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: How is she?
LORELAI: She's good, we talked, and she's good.
CHRISTOPHER: Good.
LORELAI: And she's really happy that we're married.
CHRISTOPHER: I knew she would be.
[They kiss again]
LORELAI: Hey, I was thinking about the room.
CHRISTOPHER: Hum-um.
LORELAI: And I was thinking we should paint it…
CHRISTOPHER: Yes.
LORELAI: And we should let Gigi pick the color.
CHRISTOPHER: She's gonna pick pink.
LORELAI: Pink would be great in here. Come on, help me move this out.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay.
LORELAI: [Grunts]
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, so I was upstairs. I got an idea.
LORELAI: Oh.
CHRISTOPHER: How about a flat-screen in the bedroom?
LORELAI: The bedroom?
CHRISTOPHER: Come on.
LORELAI: No!
CHRISTOPHER: Think about it!

CARY GRANT: Just a loan.
KATHARINE HEPBURN: And then I did you out of it by eloping to Maryland...
CARY GRANT: "which was very bad manners."
KATHARINE HEPBURN:...Which was very bad manners.
CARY GRANT: "But I hope to make it up to you by going through with it now as originally planned."

GILMORE MANSION – LIVING ROOM
RICHARD: Lorelai couldn't have been more than, what, 8 or 10years old? But she was very definite about the whole thing. She looked me directly in the eye, and she said, "when I grow up, I'm going to marry Tip O'Neill."
CHRISTOPHER: [Laughing]
RICHARD: I swear to you, I nearly had a heart attack.
LORELAI: I liked the name "tip." I thought it was cute, like a puppy or a bunny.
RICHARD: Anyway, I'm happy that you two got married, and quite relieved not to have had Tip O'Neill as a son-in-law. Here's to your marriage -- our heartfelt congratulations. We also got you a little gift.
LORELAI: Oh, yes, which is crying out to be opened.
RICHARD: It's just a little token to commemorate the occasion.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you. I love the look of this wrapping paper.
RICHARD: To the happy couple...
LORELAI: Oh, well, not the time.
RICHARD: ...To Lorelai and Christopher.
RORY: Hear, hear!
EMILY: To Lorelai and Christopher.
LORELAI: Long may they live. Okay, time to open?
EMILY: Yes, you may open your present. For heavens sakes you're like a dolphin at feeding time.
LORELAI: [in shock at the gift which is a picture] Wow. I mean, d-- I -- it's -- it's like, "wow."
EMILY: It's an etching by Kiki Smith.
LORELAI: Oh it's extraordinary, this item.
CHRISTOPHER: Wow.
LORELAI: Wow, right?
EMILY: It's called "Wolf Girl."
RICHARD: Baldwin, our dealer, is a big fan of Kiki Smith. Apparently she's all the rage in New York.
CHRISTOPHER: That was very generous of you.
RICHARD: Oh it's our pleasure. All young couples should cultivate an art collection.
LORELAI: Well, this is gonna start our collection off... with a bang. [Showing the picture]
RORY: [Gasps]
EMILY: I'm so happy you love it. We were flying blind without a gift registry.
LORELAI: Well, you flew great, mom.
EMILY: Of course I imagine it's difficult to have the forethought to register when you decide to suddenly elope. Everything changes when a couple elopes, doesn't it? Nothing is done in quite the traditional manner -- for instance, informing your parents of your marriage by leaving them a message on their answering machine.
CHRISTOPHER: What? You told me you told them.
LORELAI: I didn't say they were home when I told them.
RORY: Mom, you're such a chicken.
LORELAI: You left a message on their machine?
RICHARD: She certainly did.
EMILY: I come home, and I push "play" on the machine, and what do I hear between a message from Lily Margulies about her fund-raiser for Tanzanian children and one from my tennis pro, but my very own daughter telling me, guess what -- she's married.
LORELAI: Mom, I'm sorry. I just…
EMILY: Well why just talk about it? Why not share it?
LORELAI: No, no! Hey, hey!
[Emily presses play on the answering machine, Lorelai voice "Hey, just wanted you guys to know, Christopher and I are back from Paris. Gigi's all set. And, uh, we just ended up, uh...getting married. So, anyway, see you Friday. Bye!"]
EMILY: Isn't that lovely?
LORELAI: Mom, erase that, please.
EMILY: I most certainly will not. Your father and I plan to treasure it forever. We're going to have it as a keepsake or a memento. "Remember when Lorelai told us she was married?"
RICHARD: "Ah, yes, and what was it exactly that she said?" "I think it was something like this."
[Playing the message again "Hey, just wanted you guys to know, Christopher and I are back from paris. Gigi's all set. And, uh, we just ended up, uh...getting married…"]
OPENING CREDITS
GILMORE MANSION – DINING ROOM
CHRISTOPHER: The lamb is delicious, Emily.
LORELAI: Look who's being Mr. "Favorite son-in-law happy smile face"?
EMILY: I'm glad you're enjoying it Christopher. My butcher had it flown in from New Zealand.
LORELAI: First class I hope.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, the dinner is very nice.
RORY: It is.
RICHARD: It ought to be. We have cause to celebrate.
EMILY: Yes we do speaking of which, we have decided that we would like to throw you two a wedding party.
LORELAI: Oh, that's very sweet.
CHRISTOPHER: Very sweet.
LORELAI: Very sweet mum, but you know what -- it's totally unnecessary. Look you already gave us "wolf girl," which, I mean, ah? How do you top that?
RICHARD: We insist.
LORELAI: Dad we're already married. Isn't it too late?
EMILY: No but soon it will be. We need to get on this right away.
RICHARD: We don't want it to look as if there's anything to be ashamed of here, if we don't through a party who knows what people will think?
LORELAI: Why don't you give us an anniversary party? Ha like a 10th? Wouldn't that be nice, honey? I mean, what is 10 -- bronze, sandstone, particleboard?
RORY: Actually, it's tin.
EMILY: But that's not for 10 years.
LORELAI: Giving you plenty of time to plan. [Too Rory] Tin?
RORY: Things just stick in my brain.
EMILY: Lorelai, you ought to celebrate your marriage.
LORELAI: Mum we did, we did celebrate -- right after we got married, we had a beautiful meal, didn't we?
CHRISTOPHER: We had a beautiful meal.
LORELAI: Yeah we had chocolate mousse and Para liqueur and a cheese plate.
EMILY: A cheese plate? Since when is a hunk of fermented milk a suitable means for celebrating a marriage?
LORELAI: Look mum we're good. Honestly we're celebrated out.
EMILY: But what about us?
LORELAI: Hey if you and dad want a party, it's fine by me. Buy some 40s, rent an inflatable bounce house. That's great knock yourselves out.
EMILY: Well what about Rory?
LORELAI: What about Rory?
EMILY: Rory tell me don't you think this marriage should be officially celebrated?
RORY: Well... yes, actually. I think it would be nice.
RICHARD: Christopher?
CHRISTOPHER: Well I think it would be fun. And I'm not one to turn down a free cocktail.
EMILY: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Okay, then, let's celebrate. Let's have a party.
EMILY: Wonderful. Now if we book the harbor club, we can't have more than 400. So Lorelai, I'll need a list of your people as soon as is Earthly possible -- you too, Christopher.
LORELAI: well I can give you my list right now. It's me, Chris, Rory, Logan -- if Rory wants him there -- Sookie, Jackson, and Michel.
RICHARD: That's it?
EMILY: You can invite more people than that, it's your day.
LORELAI: That's my list.
EMILY: Why don't you invite some of your charming Stars Hollow friends?
LORELAI: That's okay, mom.
MEGAN: We can make it black-tie optional, if that will help.
LORELAI: It's not because they don't have black ties.
EMILY: Suit yourself now, what do you think -- a string quartet, or something more fun, like a swing band?
[Lorelai looks amused]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[They are moving Rory in]
LOGAN: My god, woman, is there a book you don't own?
RORY: I'm so sorry.
DOYLE: I think I may have re-activated my scoliosis.
PARIS: Suck it up, people. That was the last of it.
LOGAN: So much for one trip, huh?
RORY: Well who knew I had nine trips' worth of stuff? Your place is so big, it made my stuff look small and inconsequential. Did I mention I'm so sorry?
LOGAN: Two copies of "The Norton Anthology"?
RORY: They were gifts. I can't get rid of gifts.
PARIS: Okay, looks like all that's left to do now is the paperwork.
RORY: Paperwork?
PARIS: The lease.
RORY: You want me to sign a lease?
PARIS: We you are subletting from me and the last time you lived here, you just up and left in the middle of the year.
RORY: Um, you kicked me out, you moved all my stuff out in the hallway and locked the door.
PARIS: Well now you'll have a legally binding contract that will negate my ability to do that in the future.
RORY: All right. What does it say? Standard boiler-plate stuff -- just sign here and here.
RORY: Mm-hmm.
PARIS: And initial here and here.
RORY: Okay. What is this? "Rights and privileges of Logan Huntzberger or any other paramours"?
PARIS: If Logan is going to be spending an in audient amount of time here, it's fair to assess a daily tariff for water and power use.
RORY: Ah, Paris!
PARIS: It's a very simple formula, based on the number of nights he spends per month in the apartment times the approximate minutes per day he spends showering, brushing his teeth, and/or surfing the internet. And Sundays no charge.
LOGAN: It's okay. I'll kick in, Paris.
PARIS: Thataboy, Rockefeller.
RORY: All right.
PARIS: Okay. Welcome back to the hood.
RORY: Thanks.
DOYLE: It's good to have you back, Rory.
RORY: Aw, thanks, Doyle.
LOGAN: Alright I better take off.
RORY: Oh, no. You just got here, and we spent the whole time moving.
LOGAN: Why don't you come in on Thursday? I've got to wine-and-dine some clients. You should join us it should be fun. We'll rack up an obscene bill at Nobu and charge it all to my dad.
RORY: Oh I can't. It's Lucy's 21st birthday. We're throwing her a big party. I was hoping you might be able to come.
LOGAN: I can't -- Nobu.
RORY: Nobu, schmobu. It's a college party. Don't you miss college parties? Our theme's 2002.
LOGAN: Why?
RORY: Just because. Why what's your theme?
LOGAN: Contracts.
RORY: Boring. 2002's so much better. Just bring your clients, and we'll let them tap the keg.
LOGAN: Rory.
RORY: Come on. It's a 2002 party, right? In 2002, you were a college freshman. You would have been bored by businessmen and thrilled to go to a party thrown by hot senior girls.
LOGAN: It's all very tempting, but I have to go.
RORY: I know.
LOGAN: I love you.
RORY: Love you, too.
[They kiss, Logan leaves and Doyle comes in with the giant pencil Rory got whe she left the Yale paper.]
PARIS: I'll put you down for half a day, Logan.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai is knitting on the couch]
LORELAI: Good morning.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, good morning, Madame Defarge.
LORELAI: Good morning, Mr. "I remember stuff from English class in high school."
CHRISTOPHER: Can I ask how long this Mr. "Long sentence of words strung together" thing is gonna last?
LORELAI: I'm not sure, Mr. "Doesn't understand "the more annoying you tell me a bit is, the more I want to do it."
CHRISTOPHER: Look at you, knitting away, just like a proper married lady the picture of domesticity.
LORELAI: Ha ha ha.
CHRISTOPHER: So what's for breakfast, Martha Stewart? Poached eggs, blue berry muffin, oh is there gonna be fresh-squeezed orange juice? "Cause I'd really appreciate it if you could strain the pulp.
LORELAI: Yeah I got your strained pulp right here, buddy.
CHRISTOPHER: So what exactly are you knitting?
LORELAI: It doesn't matter what I'm knitting. I'm knitting just to knit.
CHRISTOPHER: Someone's philosophical.
LORELAI: No, someone is in training for the Knit-a-thon. And we get pledged by the skein, so I'm just working on my speed.
CHRISTOPHER: "Knit-a-thon"?
LORELAI: Yeah, you didn't hear about the Knit-a-thon?
CHRISTOPHER: I did not hear about the Knit-a-thon. Do you want something?
LORELAI: Yeah. Poached eggs and some orange-juice pulp.
CHRISTOPHER: How about coffee?
LORELAI: Sold. So, we are holding a Knit-a-thon the day after tomorrow to raise money to rebuild the old muddy river bridge.
CHRISTOPHER: What's wrong with the bridge?
LORELAI: Well we rebuilt it a couple years ago, but now it's started to rot.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh yeah.
LORELAI: Yeah, it's too bad, too, 'cause it was gorgeous. We all loved, loved, loved it. It was sturdy and strong, made out of this beautiful Japanese maple – which it turns out is exactly the kind of wood that attracts beetles, and I'm not talking British-invasion kinda b*at. I'm talking the kind of beetles that like to eat wood. So now we're gonna make it out of a less-delicious wood.
CHRISTOPHER: Ah. So, how goes the training? Are your fingers getting strong and muscly?
LORELAI: My fingers are fine. It's these needles. I keep dropping stitches 'cause they're slippery. I need non-slip needles.
CHRISTOPHER: Do they make non-slip needles?
LORELAI: I don't know but you know what I'm gonna go into town and see if anyone's selling them.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah I'll come with.
LORELAI: No that's okay.
CHRISTOPHER: No, no. I could use some air.
LORELAI: Yeah, but I have errands to run. And ah plus I got to go to the dry cleaner's.
CHRISTOPHER: So.
LORELAI: So I don't want to subject you to Lizzie the crazy dry cleaner. It's very intense. You know she starts complaining about…
CHRISTOPHER: Why don't you want me to come into town with you?
LORELAI: Oh. Well, you know... I just want to give people... time to adjust.
CHRISTOPHER: To?
LORELAI: To you and me. I mean, I just want to be sensitive, you know? You're not who they expected, and I-I just don't want the marriage to seem sudden. You know I-I want to kind of ease them into it.
CHRISTOPHER: Is that why you didn't want to invite any of your friends to your mother's party?
LORELAI: No. Well, I mean yeah, but 90% of it was I didn't want them to have to deal with salsa dancing and the Peabody's and the Sandborn's. You know but I guess 10% is I didn't want to feel like I'm shoving our marriage down their throats.
CHRISTOPHER: By inviting them to a party?
LORELAI: So soon. I don't want it to seem like we're flaunting. You know, I want to give them time to adjust.
CHRISTOPHER: They're not gonna adjust if they never see me.
LORELAI: Yeah. You're right.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on let's go for a stroll.
LORELAI: Okay, but a stroll. Not a strut.
CHRISTOPHER: Yes I promise I will keep my chicken-walking to an absolute minimum.
LORELAI: Al right.
LUKE'S DINER
[The place is packed with people knitting.]
LUKE: How long is this gonna go on?
CAESAR: Couple more days.
LUKE: It's ridiculous already. Somebody's gonna poke an eye out.
CAESAR: You're just bumming 'cause April's gone.
LUKE: First, get your hand off my shoulder. Second, I'm not bumming, and April is not gone. She just went back to living with her mother.
CAESAR: I'm just saying, I'm feeling you, Luke.
T.J.: Luke.
LUKE: T.J.
T.J.: I need a drink.
LUKE: We don't serve alcohol.
T.J.: Well, then, anything that's carbonated. If I drink fast enough, bubbles tend to have the same effect.
LUKE: Boy what are you doing here? Is Liz okay? She's gonna have a baby at any moment.
T.J.: It's not good, Luke.
LUKE: What?
T.J.: We're having a baby at our house.
LUKE: No we talked about this. You're gonna be a great dad T.J.
T.J.: No. You don't understand. We're having a baby at our house any minute now. Liz wants to have our baby in our living room!
LUKE: What? Why? What about a hospital?
T.J.: She won't go! She's got it in her head that this should be done at home.
LUKE: My sister is gonna have her baby at home?
T.J.: [Takes a drink] She got the idea from -- phew! -- Marcy hedges, who plays the midwife at the renaissance festivals. Only Marcy has five kids -- all born in hospitals -- and now she's telling Liz how amazing and natural it is for her to do it at home.
LUKE: This is crazy.
T.J.: Liz said she had Jess at a hospital, and she wants to have this one at home. She has this a, birth coach, called a Doula. That's not her real name. Don't call her that. She's very touchy. Her real name is Sandy.
LUKE: Okay. Sandy the doula.
T.J.: Anyway, Sandy's done about 200 of these home births, and she says statistically, they're every bit as safe as hospital births.
LUKE: I can't believe she's having her baby at home.
T.J.: Anyway, she wants you to be there at the birth. She wants the baby to be born around family. So I promised I'd get you to come.
LUKE: Of course. Sure I'll be there. Just call me whenever, and I'll come right by.
T.J.: Great. [Thumbs up sign from T.J.] Thanks, Luke. [Takes a swig of the drink again] Whoo! That feels good.
LUKE: Yean alright I'll see you later, T.J. Just let me know when the water breaks. Go take care of her, all right?
T.J.: All right.
LUKE: See you, man. [Looking across the street he see Chris and Lorelai, he slams the door shut, tangled in some yarn.] That's it! All right, this diner is now a knit-free zone! Stop knitting or get the hell out!
[People murmuring]
TOWN SQUARE
[People are setting up for the Knit-a-thon, there are large fake balls of yarn banners and stuff]
BABETTE: Needle in, yarn around, new loop through, old loop up. Needle in, yarn around, new loop through, old loop up. Keep a gentle tension on the strand!
KIRK: Humongous needle!
TAYLOR: Careful! Just because it's decorative doesn't mean it's not sharp!
LORELAI: I don't like root beer…
CHRISTOPHER: No.
LORELAI: Not without carbonation. You want it?
CHRISTOPHER: Your used dum dum?
LORELAI: It's not used. It's vintage.
CHRISTOPHER: It was nice of Lizzie, though.
LORELAI: Yes dude, 15 minutes of perchloroethylene talk? We earned those dum dums fair and square.
BABETTE: All right, knit and purl, like brick and mortar!
LORELAI: Hey, Babette!
BABETTE: Oh, hey! [Too the ladies knitting] Keep going with the rib stitch there. [back to Lorelai] How are you, sweetheart? Hey, Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: How you doing, Babette?
BABETTE: Congratulations on the getting-married thing. I'd give you a hug, but my hands are kind of full here. So, you eloped.
LORELAI: Yeah we were in Paris and we eloped.
BABETTE: Well that's smart, eloping. Smart. Who needs the hassle of a real wedding, you know?
LORELAI: Yeah.
BABETTE: All the planning and the fuss, so much stress.
CHRISTOPHER: Exactly.
BABETTE: Plus the dress. I mean, why would anyone want to buy a big, expensive wedding dress you could only wear once? Except for me. I got to wear mine twice. But once was for Halloween. I was the bride of chucky.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yeah? Did Morey go as chucky?
BABETTE: Huh?! No, he was a futuristic pirate! So, welcome to Stars Hollow!
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you. It's good to be here.
BABETTE: Uh-huh. [Back to the ladies knitting] Knit and purl!
[Chris and Lorelai walk off.]
MISS PATTY: Lorelai, Christopher, there you are.
LORELAI: Hey, patty.
MISS PATTY: I'm sorry I didn't get this to you sooner. Part of my job as town social chair is greeting all newlyweds with the Stars Hollow welcome wagon.
CHRISTOPHER: Look at all this. Thank you so much.
MISS PATTY: Just a few odds and ends from our town merchants to say "welcome."
CHRISTOPHER: This is so cool I didn't know the welcome wagon came in a real wagon.
MISS PATTY: Yeah. Well... so there you go.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, terrific. Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you, Patty.
MISS PATTY: So, how are you adjusting to Stars Hollow, Christopher?
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, it's terrific.
MISS PATTY: I'd bet you're bored senseless here.
CHRISTOPHER: [Laughing] No, no. Not at all.
MISS PATTY: Well there's hardly any nightlife. I mean a worldly guy like you must feel like he's out in the sticks.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, my discothequing days are mostly behind me.
MISS PATTY: Anyway, I probably should run. Enjoy the wagon.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.
LORELAI: Bye, Patty.
CHRISTOPHER: You want a ride?
LORELAI: No. That's okay. [Chuckles]
CHRISTOPHER: [Chuckles]
LUCKY AND OLIVIA'S CAMPUS ROOM
[Marty is hanging a poster, Rory comes in the open door, she looks nerves, Marty is not.]
RORY: Hey.
MARTY: Hi.
RORY: Um, I have some 2002 paraphernalia here.
MARTY: Okay.
RORY: Are Lucy and Olivia home?
MARTY: No.
RORY: 'Cause they said to bring this stuff by. Do you know when they'll be back?
MARTY: No.
RORY: Do you know where they went?
MARTY: Just down the hall.
LUCY: Rory!
OLIVIA: Yay! Rory's here!
RORY: Oh, hey, guys.
LUCY: You brought stuff.
RORY: As promised.
OLIVIA: Let's see.
LUCY: Boyfriend. [They kiss] Nice poster work.
MARTY: I went with double-sided tape rather than thumbtacks. I think it gives it a cleaner look.
LUCY: I think you're right. Plus, double-sided tape is so 2002. You're a genius.
MARTY: You're my inspiration.
OLIVIA: [Looking at CD's] You brought J.Lo?
RORY: Of course. And I have boots.
LUCY: Oh, my god, so did we!
[Giggling]
OLIVIA: We are gonna ugg-up!
RORY: My feet were so much more comfortable in 2002.
LUCY: What do you think, boyfriend?
MARTY: Very Clydesdale.
LUCY: Hey, compliments only from boyfriends on birthdays.
MARTY: You're beautiful.
LUCY: Thank you.
[Rory looks uncomfortable again.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Anna enters]
ANNA: Hey, Luke.
LUKE: Hey, Anna. How's April doing?
ANNA: Oh she's doing great. I'm pretty sure as of Friday, she had shown her appendix scar to every one of her teachers and classmates. She's quite proud of it.
LUKE: [chuckles] I'm just glad she's doing good.
ANNA: Yeah me too. Um, can we talk in private?
LUKE: Sure. Come on up. Caesar, I'll be back!
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke and Anna enter]
ANNA: Oh, the place looks nice.
LUKE: April's handiwork.
ANNA: Right. She told me -- cerulean. [They sit at the table] So, um...my mom…
LUKE: Yeah. How's she doing?
ANNA: Still recovering.
LUKE: Oh.
ANNA: I think I have her care all worked out, but it is an ongoing Rubik's cube of day, night, and weekend nurses.
LUKE: Yeah that's tough.
ANNA: Especially being on the other side of the country. She's really lonely. I thought about moving her up here. But she's been living in that house for 42 years, and I just feel like it would be cruel.
LUKE: Yeah say, April can stay with me any time. Whatever you need.
ANNA: Luke... I've decided that April and I are gonna move to New Mexico.
LUKE: Oh. Really? Wow.
ANNA: I-I'm sorry, but my mother is all alone.
LUKE: Yeah. Yeah. Uh, it's, uh... wow.
ANNA: But you know it's where I grew up, so I know the area. They have a lot of really good schools.
LUKE: Yeah does, does April know?
ANNA: I told her last night.
LUKE: How's -- I mean... is she okay with it?
ANNA: Well, she's not thrilled. It'll take some getting used to, but...
LUKE: So, when? How soon?
ANNA: As soon as possible.
LUKE: Mm-hmm.
ANNA: Tina, my assistant manager, is gonna run the business for me and I've already been looking online at houses, found a nice little neighborhood.
LUKE: Huh.
ANNA: And I just to – I wanted to, you know, let you know.
LUKE: Yeah. Hey, uh, I guess you got to do what you got to do. You know I mean, when my dad was sick...
ANNA: Yeah.
LUKE: Yeah.
ANNA: Mm-hmm.
LUKE: Mm-hmm.
ANNA: I should go. [Luke nods] I have some things.
LUKE: Sure. Sure. Yeah.
[Luke looks stunned]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Sookie is cooking, Lorelai enters]
SOOKIE: Drat you, you dratted spaghetti, you slippery, slithery, uncooperative…
LORELAI: am I interrupting something?
SOOKIE: No.
LORELAI: Seriously if you and spaghetti need privacy, I can come back later.
SOOKIE: In the middle of the night last night, I woke up with an idea.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: For days, I've been trying to figure out what to serve at my Knit-a-thon booth, right? So, it's 2:00 A.M. Flash! I have a vision. Balls of yarn made out of spaghetti, with breadsticks stuck in the middle, like knitting needles. It's brilliant! Brilliant! Horrible!
LORELAI: Not that appetizing. Why don't you just make regular spaghetti?
SOOKIE: 'Cause that's not theme-y.
LORELAI: Oh.
SOOKIE: Why are you in early? I thought you were not coming in till late.
LORELAI: Well, I was, but I had some paperwork and...
SOOKIE: And, um...
LORELAI: Christopher and I just walked through town.
SOOKIE: And?
LORELAI: Everyone was very cordial.
SOOKIE: Ooh. Cordial?
LORELAI: Yes. They said hello. They shook his hand. They welcomed him to Stars Hollow.
SOOKIE: Jeez, really? Cordial?
LORELAI: Yes. Creepy, right? I saw miss patty and Babette. Neither one of them pinched his butt.
SOOKIE: Well honey, you married an outsider.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: We just -- we all thought you and Luke...
LORELAI: I knew people thought me and Luke. I thought me and Luke. But it's not me and Luke. It's me and Christopher.
SOOKIE: I know. It's just – people really loved you and Luke.
LORELAI: Right but it's not their life. It's my life. And frankly I don't see why I should have to go around feeling bad that my life didn't turn out the way everybody wanted it to.
SOOKIE: I know…
LORELAI: I'm sick of it. I really am. And, look, I understand that you liked Luke and you're not so sure about Christopher, but, Sookie, you're my best friend. I really need your support here. I - I mean, Christopher is my husband, and it would be great if you would just get on board.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay?
SOOKIE: Yeah I'm on board. I mean what do you need? I'll swab the deck, I'll hoist the sail -- anything nautical.
LORELAI: Okay I need you to help me get the rest of the town on board.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay what do we do?
SOOKIE: We need a campaign.
LORELAI: Right. A campaign.
SOOKIE: Oh, he could walk Paul Anka around town. Cute guy, cute dog -- very appealing.
LORELAI: Paul Anka's not good with sidewalks -- sensitive paws. He could pull him in the welcome wagon -- or Jackson.
SOOKIE: You want him to pull Jackson around on a wagon?
LORELAI: No maybe he and Jackson could do something together. You know Jackson's got a lot of clout. If people see that Jackson likes Christopher, then maybe they'll like Christopher.
SOOKIE: You think Jackson's got a lot of clout?
LORELAI: Jackson has tons of clout. He's lousy with clout.
SOOKIE: Okay. What should they do?
LORELAI: Something where they'll be seen.
SOOKIE: Ooh, how about a movie?
LORELAI: Too dark.
SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah.
LORELAI: Pancakes at Al's?
SOOKIE: Jackson is off of wheat. But, ooh, how about country night at miss patty's?
LORELAI: Chris and Jackson?
SOOKIE: Well I mean, Jackson is a fiendish two-stepper, but he's handsy.
LORELAI: What do regular guys do?
SOOKIE: Grunt?
LORELAI: Scratch?
SOOKIE: Leave the toilet seat up?
LORELAI: Talk about sports?
SOOKIE: Talk about cars?
LORELAI: Burp?
SOOKIE: Beer!
LORELAI: Drink beer.
SOOKIE: At Casey's!
LORELAI: Perfect.
SOOKIE: Oh, like manly.
LORELAI: Simple.
SOOKIE: Ooh! And while they're scratching and grunting, we can actual go do something fun.
LORELAI: Country night at miss Patty's.
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm. Hee-haw.
LUKE'S DINER
[April is reading at the counter]
LUKE: So, what are you up for tonight? I was thinking we could rent "A Brief History of Time" again. Maybe I'll understand something more than the credits.
APRIL: Sure.
LUKE: Look...your mom told me you were moving.
APRIL: To New Mexico.
LUKE: Yeah it's not so bad. You've been there visiting your grandma before, right?
APRIL: I don't want to move to the desert! It's just, there aren't even any seasons! It's just it's hot, and it's a miserable place, that and I hate it!
LUKE: April let's take a walk. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[They go out side]
LUKE: Look I know you're a little upset, but this could be a really good thing – I mean the new people you'll meet, the teachers you'll impress.
APRIL: I'll never see my friends again.
LUKE: Oh of course you will – breaks from school over the summer.
APRIL: No, Janie Freedman moved to Virginia at the end of last year 'cause her dad got some teaching job. And she said she'd stay in touch with everybody, and she did for like a week. And the after that nobody ever heard from her again.
LUKE: It doesn't have to be like that.
APRIL: We're moving 2,000 miles away! That's how it's gonna work! Mom is ruining my life!
LUKE: April.
APRIL: You know I'm finally happy. I finally have friends. It took me forever, and now I'm just gonna be that weird, dorky loser girl all over again!
LUKE: I know. Come on. It's gonna be fine.



PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Rory is making her bed]
PARIS: I don't get it.
RORY: What?
PARIS: 2002 party.
RORY: It's a theme.
PARIS: How is that a theme?
RORY: It's just supposed to be funny.
PARIS: I'm not laughing.
RORY: Well you don't have to go.
PARIS: Why not 2001?
RORY: It could be 2001, I guess.
PARIS: "Space Odyssey" -- that's a theme. People dress up like astronauts or apes.
RORY: I don't know what to tell you, Paris.
PARIS: Will there be dancing?
RORY: Yes there will be dancing.
PARIS: What kind of dancing?
RORY: I don't know. 2002 dancing?
PARIS: So we're talking mostly hip-hop.
RORY: Paris you don't have to hip-hop-dance at this party.
PARIS: I can hip-hop-dance. Don't you worry. Doyle and I will be scorching the floorboards.
[Cell phone rings]
RORY: Looking forward to that. [Answering phone] Hi, mom.
[Lorelai at home]
LORELAI: So what are you gonna pledge me?
RORY: Um, in the Knit-a-thon?
LORELAI: Yeah what do you say -- 10 bucks a skein?
RORY: How about $5?
LORELAI: So, $15?
RORY: Make it $3.
LORELAI: $20 a skein?
RORY: A buck 50.
LORELAI: 25 smackeroos?
RORY: 75 cents.
LORELAI: We have no idea how to haggle, do we.
[Nelly's "Hot in Herre" plays starts at Rory's place]
RORY: No idea. Why don't you just put me down for $30 even?
LORELAI: I will not take less than $30, and then you got a done deal.
RORY: The best I can do is $30.
LORELAI: Alright you give me $30, and it's a deal.
RORY: Do I have to pledge dad, too?
LORELAI: No, no he's just a spectator. You know what he's doing? He's going on a man-date with Jackson.
RORY: Cute. A mandated man-date?
LORELAI: Yes, it was suggested enthusiastically. What is that you're listening to?
RORY: [Laughing] That's Paris. She and Doyle are threatening to scorch the floorboards at Lucy's party.
LORELAI: Aw. Poor floorboards. He ah, how did the party prep go?
RORY: Good. We're just about ready to party like it's 2002. There's just one thing -- this whole Marty debacle. It's just so annoying to be around him.
LORELAI: Is he still acting all cold and weird?
RORY: Beyond cold and beyond weird.
LORELAI: Well you're a hard one to get over kid you know. He probably just feels bad. When guys feel rejected, they act all cold and weird.
RORY: Yeah but I rejected him, if that's even what happened, years ago. I mean isn't there a statute of limitations for being a jerk?
LORELAI: Well Marty just probably feels awkward. Maybe you should try to be nice.
RORY: He's not exactly being nice to me.
LORELAI: Well, you have to be the bigger person.
RORY: Why doesn't he be the bigger person?
LORELAI: Because you're 11 feet tall and he's a mere mortal.
RORY: I hate being 11 feet tall.
LORELAI: I know. It's hell finding jeans that fit, huh? [Chris comes down stairs] Uh I got to go. I got a man-date fashion disaster.
RORY: Alright I'll talk to you later.
LORELAI: So, uh, $30 a skein?
RORY: Total -- $30 total.
LORELAI: Yeah. [Hangs up, talking to Chris] Hey.
CHRISTOPHER: W-what?
LORELAI: Is that what you're wearing?
CHRISTOPHER: What, what's wrong with what I'm wearing?
LORELAI: Nothing. It's just that it's, um...
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: ...Black.
CHRISTOPHER: It's a black shirt.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, then.
LORELAI: It's very Joaquin phoenix at the Oscars.
CHRISTOPHER: I have no clue what that means.
LORELAI: It's very fitted.
CHRISTOPHER: I should wear a shirt that doesn't fit?
LORELAI: No.
CHRISTOPHER: Should I tuck it in?
LORELAI: No!
CHRISTOPHER: Why are you grimacing at this shirt?!
LORELAI: Um...I don't know. Maybe it's not the best thing to wear on your man-date with Jackson.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay first of all, if you say "man-date" one more time, there is no way in hell I am leaving this house. And second, last I knew, I was about to go have a beer with a farmer. I don't think it really matters what I'm wearing.
LORELAI: um it is very important that you make a good impression.
CHRISTOPHER: Lore come on how great did our walk through town go? You were worried about that, and everybody was nice.
LORELAI: They were nice.
CHRISTOPHER: It went great.
LORELAI: Eh.
CHRISTOPHER: Didn't it?
LORELAI: Nah.
CHRISTOPHER: What are you saying?
LORELAI: I'm saying it didn't go so great. They were cordial, they were polite.
CHRISTOPHER: But the wagon...
LORELAI: Was full of cleaning supplies and shoe trees. When Claude and Michael Davies got married, they got handmade clothing and homemade baked goods, and ah the pizza guy whittled them bookends in the shape of Senegalese tigers. That's a welcome wagon. We got a "we're tolerating that you're here" wagon. Sorry.
CHRISTOPHER: So, going out with Jackson is important because...?
LORELAI: Jackson is loved. Jackson is respected. If you're in with Jackson, if you're in with Stars Hollow.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, maybe I could wear the gray polo shirt.
LORELAI: [Gasps] I love that idea!
CHRISTOPHER: What about the jeans?
LORELAI: They're fine. They're just a little tight.
CHRISTOPHER: All right, I'll change the jeans.
LORELAI: Oh.
CHRISTOPHER: The shoes?
LORELAI: Ugh.
CHRISTOPHER: All right, I'll change the shoes. I hate to say this out loud, but all of a sudden, I'm very nervous about my man-date with a farmer.
LORELAI: You're gonna be great. Not too much stuff in the hair!
CASEY'S BAR - NIGHT
[Jackson and Chris are sitting at the bar]
JACKSON: So, what do you think?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm down with any place where you can throw your peanut shells on the floor.
JACKSON: Not exactly a Manhattan hot spot.
CHRISTOPHER: A beer in Stars Hollow tastes just as good as a beer in Soho, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper.
JACKSON: It's a microbrew. They brew it right here on the premises.
CHRISTOPHER: Ah. Wow.
[The TV can be heard in the back ground, "Dahntay Jones brings it into the front court."]
CHRISTOPHER: So, what's your best crop? Do you have a favorite?
JACKSON: Ah, don't get me started. I love them all. But it has been a standout eggplant year. Do you like eggplant?
CHRISTOPHER: Yep.
JACKSON: Don't say another word. I am your eggplant connection.
CHRISTOPHER: Guess I'm gonna have to get rid of my other guy, then. [Chuckling] It's just -- it's just a joke. [Chuckles nervously]
JACKSON: Oh. Yeah. [Chuckles]
[TV "They're just not playing aggressively. Here's Jones. That's Brian Williams. His sh*t rims out. He's sh**ting only 35% from the floor.]
JACKSON: So, you and Lorelai, huh?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
JACKSON: That's quite an achievement. I mean, many have tried, many have failed.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I feel pretty lucky.
[TV "And scott padgett, working inside, has it batted away.]
JACKSON: You know what I love about farming? The commitment. [Chris nods in agreement] No shortcuts, no quitting. You have got to be there for your crops morning, noon, and night. I mean you can have the greatest soil and perfect seeds, but if you are not 100% committed, you might as well pave over those 32 acres and build yourself a strip mall. You know what I mean.
CHRISTOPHER: It's a lot of responsibility.
JACKSON: It sure is.
CHRISTOPHER: It sounds like you really love farming.
JACKSON: I do. Sookie and I, we both do.
CHRISTOPHER: Me too.
CAFÉ'
[Luke is sitting at a table, Anna comes in and is on her cell phone]
ANNA: Yeah. If you want to come by, I'll be in all afternoon. Great. I'll see you then. Bye. [Hangs up, too Luke] Hey.
LUKE: Thanks for coming.
ANNA: Sure. What's up?
LUKE: Well, April -- she's pretty upset.
ANNA: Yeah, I know.
LUKE: I just wanted to make sure we were doing everything we could to make it as easy as you know it could be for her.
ANNA: So what have you got in mind?
LUKE: Okay well, I was thinking. Instead of pulling her out in the middle of the school year, maybe you could wait to move till the end of the school year?
ANNA: And you don't think I thought about that.
LUKE: No you could go back and forth, and still be there for you mum and I could help covering for April here.
ANNA: No, I have to be out there full time as soon as possible, Luke.
LUKE: Oh well, she could stay with me to finish the year. She's already been with me for two months, you know? I'd love it. It would be great, actually.
ANNA: Luke, I know you mean well, but that's not gonna happen okay. I'm not splitting apart from April for six months.
LUKE: No, I understand. Okay, so, maybe you know we could buy her some plane tickets so, so she'll know she's going back and forth and when?
ANNA: We can't make that plan now.
LUKE: No it doesn't have to include everything. But, like, I already told her she could stay with me for spring break and part of the summer, so if…
ANNA: Whoa. You told her that? You actually said that?
LUKE: Yeah.
ANNA: I have no idea what we'll be doing then.
LUKE: I just assumed that…
ANNA: You have no right making promises to my daughter.
LUKE: I just wanted her…
ANNA: I don't want you talking to her about this again. Are we clear?
LUKE: Anna.
ANNA: No, Luke. Listen, these are my decisions. I'm not gonna have you going behind my back, making promises to April that I can't keep.
LUKE: So, are you saying she's not coming back?
ANNA: I am saying I'm not ready to make decisions. And they are my decisions to make, not yours, Luke. Now I'm gonna go.
[Luke is left stunned, then his cell phone rings]
LUKE: Hello?
[At Liz and T.J. house Liz is screaming]
T.J.: It's showtime, Luke!
LUKE: What the hell's going on over there? Is Liz okay?
T.J.: She's amazing! We're having a baby, baby! It's beautiful! You got to get over here.
LUKE: I'm on my way!
TOWN SQUARE – KNIT-A-THON
["Old Fashion Show Business" music plays]
KIRK: Free needles. Free for everyone. Free needles! Free needles!
LORELAI: See? Who says Stars Hollow's not progressive? Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey, you guys.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, Jackson. What's up? [They shake hands]
JACKSON: Hey. How's it going? Wednesday night -- we still on to watch the game?
CHRISTOPHER: Sounds good.
LORELAI: Alright we're gonna stake out some prime knitting real estate.
JACKSON: See you later.
SOOKIE: Save us a spot!
LORELAI: We will. You're seeing Jackson Wednesday, huh?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, we were thinking maybe.
LORELAI: I guess that could work.
CHRISTOPHER: What do you mean?
LORELAI: I have some other plans for you.
CHRISTOPHER: Plans?
LORELAI: Yeah you got bird-watching with Morey, darts with Andrew. Ooh, and Glenn Belkin wanted to have coffee with you. He is the head coach of the peewee little league teams.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yeah?
LORELAI: Yes. He thinks he might have a plum assistant-coaching job for you.
CHRISTOPHER: Assistant coach, huh?
LORELAI: Um-mm, all right, I'm feeling the knitting vibes right here.
CHRISTOPHER: Well okay.
MISS PATTY: Hello, hello!
BABETTE: Hiya, kids. Boy, it's a chilly one, huh?
TAYLOR: [At a podium] Welcome, fair citizens of Stars Hollow. We come together on this glorious autumnal day to rescue our beloved muddy river bridge. And the knitting will commence at precisely 10:00 A.M., And we will knit unceasingly until our long day's journey ends at the stroke of 10:00 P.M.
KIRK: Taylor, 10:00 A.M. Is 40 seconds away.
TAYLOR: What? No. I've got 3 1/2 more minutes. I've timed this speech to last exactly 3 1/2 minutes. Um, a bridge is not merely a feat of engineering and architecture. A bridge is also a metaphor.
KIRK: Taylor, I'm sorry. Your watch is wrong. I have precise atomic clock time. 28 seconds.
BABETTE: I'm with Kirk! 26 seconds!
TAYLOR: But I just got this watch.
KIRK: Make that 22, 21.
MAN: 20.
TAYLOR: As I was saying, [Speaking very fast] a bridge is a metaphor, a meeting place between here and there, between the past and the future. The Golden Gate, the Brooklyn... to raise funds... our duty as citizens!
KIRK: Nine seconds!
TAYLOR: Real-time accounting of the funds approved.
KIRK: Seven seconds!
TAYLOR: As we strive toward…
KIRK: 6…
THE WHOLE CROWED: [Chanting over Taylor as he continues to speak] 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
TAYLOR: Oh, fine! Go ahead and knit!
[Music starts and crowd starts knitting and laughing]
LUCY'S PARTY
[The room is packed]
LUCY: [too some guests] Thank you! Thanks so much.
RORY: Hey.
LUCY: Hi.
RORY: How are you enjoying your first legal drink?
LUCY: Third, actually. I like it, although I kind of miss being a lawbreaker.
RORY: [Chuckles]
LUCY: Oh, my god. It's Paris Geller.
RORY: I told you.
LUCY: You totally delivered. Who's the dude?
RORY: That's her boyfriend, Doyle.
LUCY: I'm fascinated.
RORY: Well go talk to her.
LUCY: Really?
RORY: It's your party.
LUCY: How do I look?
RORY: You look tiara'ed, 21, and fabulous.
LUCY: [Too Paris and Doyle] Hi! Thank you for coming to my party.
PARIS: Nice party…
[Rory spots Marty and the bar and goes over.]
RORY: Barkeep, I'll have an upside-down tequila slammer with a twist.
MARTY: I don't know how to make that.
RORY: Yeah, I just made it up.
MARTY: Oh.
RORY: Really? Is this the way it's gonna be? I say something, and you grunt and make me feel like an idiot, really that's it?
MARTY: What do you want me to say?
RORY: Well, what I would like you to say is that you've put me in a really difficult position, and the least you can do is not be a jerk about it.
MARTY: I'm sorry.
RORY: Yeah?
MARTY: Yeah.
RORY: So you're done being a jerk?
MARTY: Y-yeah, I-I'm done.
RORY: Good.
MARTY: So you still want that upside-down tequila slammer?
RORY: With a twist.
MARTY: [Chuckles] Right. Probably has tequila in it.
RORY: Yeah.
[Both laugh]
MARTY: Um, the upside-down part, I'll have to improvise. But the slammer and the twist are pretty straightforward. You might want to stand back.
RORY: Oh, okay.
[Pink's "get the party started" plays and Paris and Doyle dance.]
CROWD: Go, Paris! Go, Paris! Go, Paris! Go, Paris! Go, Paris! [Cheering]
LIZ AND T.J.'S HOUSE
[Liz, T.J. and Luke are looking at the new baby]
T.J.: Shh! It's okay, sweet girl.
LUKE: Y-you sure about the name "Doula"?
T.J.: She's such a Doula. Isn't that right, gorgeous?
LIZ: It's cute, right?
LUKE: Yeah no, no.
T.J.: What's that, Doula? [High-pitched] I want my uncle Luke to hold me.
LUKE: [Chuckles]
T.J.: You heard her.
LUKE: Oh, no, no, no. You keep her.
T.J.: [High-pitched] Please! Uncle Lukey!
LUKE: No, really, really, really, I don't have...
LIZ: Come on Luke.
T.J.: Come on
LUKE: I-I don't have to.
T.J.: [Imitating crying] I want my uncle Lukey to hold me!
LUKE: Okay. Okay.
T.J.: [Normal voice] Here you go, Doula.
LUKE: Hey, Doula.
T.J.: Isn't she beautiful? Look at her eyes. She's got Liz's eyes.
LIZ: It's true.
T.J.: Ah and -- and aunt Sissy's chin, right? That's totally sissy's chin.
LIZ: No, Sissy was adopted.
T.J.: So?
LIZ: So.
T.J.: Ohh! Well, I-I don't know how she does it, but she's got her chin.
LIZ: [Chuckles] What do you think, Luke?
LUKE: [Smiling] She's great.
T.J.: That's your uncle Luke. And Luke's daughter is your cousin April. Now, I bet April is gonna be your number-one babysitter. Am I right, Luke?
[Luke is now thinking of April]
LUKE: Yeah. Sure.
TOWN SQUARE – KNIT-A-THON
[The knit-a-thon continues]
TAYLOR: $2,200! Not bad, people! Not good, exactly, but not bad. And we have seven more hours to make up the rest, so keep on knitting! And as you do, think of the bridge!
CHRISTOPHER: Who wants coffee?
LORELAI: Is that a rhetorical question?
MISS PATTY: Thank you, Christopher. We're not gonna make it, are we?
BABETTE: Not without doping.
LORELAI: You guys don't talk like that! Think of the bridge. We'll never be able to look it in the I-bar again if we let it down.
JACKSON: How's it going?
[Chris walks to the podium]
SOOKIE: Well I can't tell if my hands are cramping or numb, but they just keep knitting. So I guess I'm trying not to think about it, although I guess, right now, I am thinking about it.
MISS PATTY: Maybe scheduling an outdoor event in November wasn't such a great move.
LORELAI: It was a great move -- a Fred-and-Ginger-type move, it's just a brisk fall day.
[Taylor is seen thanking Chris]
BABETTE: Nah, it's a bad move, but it's part of a great tradition of bad moves by Taylor.
TAYLOR: Could I have everyone's attention, please? I just received a donation of $7,800! Thanks very much to Stars Hollow's newest resident, Christopher Hayden, for bringing us up to our goal of $10,000!
LORELAI: Honey?
BABETTE: Christopher, you did that?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
MISS PATTY: Well, yeah, I… well, tha-- thank you. Uh, I-it was really...
SOOKIE: Generous. It's generous, right?
BABETTE: Yeah, generous.
SOOKIE: Thanks, Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: You're welcome. I just figured…
MISS PATTY: So what do we stop knitting now?
TAYLOR: Okay pack it up, people.
MISS PATTY: I guess we stop knitting now.
TAYLOR: We've reached our goal. Our work is done here. If we get that llama back in the next half-hour, we're gonna save a bundle.
LORELAI: Wait, wait you guy, what are you doing? W-why are you leaving?
MISS PATTY: You heard Taylor.
LORELAI: Yeah but nobody ever listens to Taylor. Come on we got to keep knitting, there's seven more hours.
BABETTE: What's the point?!
LORELAI: The point is, it's fun. It's a festival. We haven't even gotten rowdy, we haven't even wrapped Taylor in yarn yet.
SOOKIE: Like a big Taylor cozy.
LORELAI: Yeah.
BABETTE: We already got all the money. Thanks very much, Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: You're welcome.
LORELAI: Gypsy?
GYPSY: 7,800 buckaroos. Wow. You must really love bridges, Christopher.
LORELAI: What are you doing?
GYPSY: I'm gonna go catch a movie.
LORELAI: Wait a minute. Where is your Stars Hollow spirit, huh? Where's the love of knitting just for knitting's sake?
GYPSY: At the movies?
LORELAI: [Exhales]
SOOKIE: Sorry, honey.
LORELAI: Yeah.
MISS PATTY: I wonder what's playing.
BABETTE: I don't know but I'll bet it's nice and toasty in there. Thanks again, Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: Sure. Happy to help.
TAYLOR: Okay, let's get those needles down! And careful, there, fellas! Just because they're decorative doesn't mean they're not sharp.
[Every one is now packing up]
LUCY'S PARTY
[Rory and Olivia are sitting on the couch]
RORY: How is she still dancing?
OLIVIA: Paris?
RORY: No -- Lucy. Paris I understand, 'cause Paris has been training for this like it's an Olympic event.
OLIVIA: [Chuckles]
RORY: But Lucy, Lucy weighs 11 pounds, and I'm pretty sure most of that is tequila by now.
OLIVIA: The girl loves to move.
RORY: uh-mm. Oh, buzz-cut boys going through.
OLIVIA: Mmm! I'm going in. I've got time for one or two more awkward interactions before the night is through.
[India Arie's "video" plays]
MARTY: [Sitting on the couch] The bar is closed!
RORY: You finally quit.
MARTY: Nope, just ran out of booze.
RORY: I think I drank most of it. That upside twisted slammer was living up to its name, man. I don't know if I'm more twisted or slammed.
MARTY: I'm both. I think I had three of them. Or was it four?
RORY: You know, the last time I saw you drunk, you were passed out and naked outside my dorm room.
MARTY: So, the truth comes out after all these years. You checked me out.
RORY: I did not. No it was uncomfortable and weird.
MARTY: Well, it's for the best. I was quite the scrawny freshman. I think I actually weighed 98 pounds.
RORY: [Laughs]
MARTY: But, you know, now...
RORY: Oh you've been working out.
MARTY: Can't you tell? I'm huge. I'm massive. I'm Marty Schwarzenegger.
RORY: I can tell. You're looking good.
MARTY: And you are more beautiful than ever.
[uncomfortable silence]
RORY: Um, you should be out there with Lucy.
[Marty gets up and goes to Lucy]
LUCY: Hi!
[They kiss and an annoyed or confused Rory looks on.]
STARS HOLLOW – STREET
[Night time]
CHRISTOPHER: Why should I feel bad that I donated $7,000 to help save the bridge?
LORELAI: You shouldn't.
CHRISTOPHER: I don't. I thought the point was to save the bridge.
LORELAI: Well, the point was to save it with knitting.
CHRISTOPHER: That doesn't make any…
LORELAI: I know it doesn't make any sense. That's Stars Hollow. That's just how it is. It's hard for outsiders to understand.
HONOR: So I'm an outsider?
LORELAI: For now.
CHRISTOPHER: I thought I was doing a good thing.
LORELAI: I know you just don't have to drop all that money like that.
CHRISTOPHER: I know I don't have to.
LORELAI: I mean you don't have to try so hard to get people to like you.
CHRISTOPHER: [Laughing]
LORELAI: What.
CHRISTOPHER: That's funny.
LORELAI: Why?
CHRISTOPHER: 'Cause you're the one who's making me try so hard. [Lorelai gasps] Bird-watching, backgammon, darts, assistant-managing a peewee baseball team?
LORELAI: Oh I just want…
CHRISTOPHER: I know. You want people to like me. You know what? I'm a likable guy. I always have been. I may not be the smartest guy or the toughest guy, but I'm the guy that people like.
LORELAI: You are.
CHRISTOPHER: And you know why people in Stars Hollow are gonna like me?
LORELAI: Why?
CHRISTOPHER: Because I love you. And I'm gonna be here, loving you.
LORELAI: You are?
CHRISTOPHER: You bet. You know, when you're a farmer, you got to be there for your crops. It's not about the seeds or the soil. It's about being there, being committed, all day, every day, forever.
LORELAI: Farmer, huh?
CHRISTOPHER: Why not?
LORELAI: You know what, Mr. "Doesn't seem like he knows what he's talking about but is actually pretty wise"?
CHRISTOPHER: What's that, Mrs. "Goes through 500 emotions every hour of the day"?
LORELAI: I love you a lot.
[They kiss]
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, you're okay, too.
ANNA'S HOUSE
[Luke arrives, gets out of his truck and knocks on the door.]
ANNA: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
ANNA: April's not here.
LUKE: I know. She's sleeping at Gabrielle Wilder's tonight.
ANNA: So, what's up?
LUKE: I also know that Gabrielle has a peanut allergy, and before I drop her off, I check that April isn't packing a snickers bar. I also know that she likes Gabby's coin collection, so I thought I might take her over to a coin shop in Stamford, 'cause she'd like it.
ANNA: What are you doing here, Luke?
LUKE: You're always telling me I can't do this with your daughter and that I can't do that with your daughter. Well, she's not just your daughter, Anna. She's my daughter, too.
ANNA: Luke…
LUKE: No. No. I know I wasn't around for all those years. But, you know, that was your decision. That was your choice, Anna. And, frankly, it was a damn lousy one. Okay I didn't get to see her born or take her first steps or take her to her first day of school -- none of it. And I can never get any of that back. It's gone! That's not gonna happen anymore. That, I can guarantee you.
ANNA: What are you saying?
LUKE: That she's my kid, all right? She's our kid. She's not just yours. And I'm not gonna let you treat me this way. I'm her father. God, why do I even have to say that? I mean, April and I, we have this relationship, okay? A-and you can't just decide things. That's not how this works, okay? I mean we have to make decisions together, decisions about April. And I will fight you. I will fight you for that, Anna, if I have to. I have rights. I'm her father, and I have rights.

KITCHEN – UNKNOWN HOUSE
[Lorelai and Chris are looking at a new house, they are acting]
CHRISTOPHER: I got a meeting in half an hour, so I better run.
LORELAI: Okay, well, have a great day.
CHRISTOPHER: Thanks again for breakfast.
LORELAI: My pleasure.
CHRISTOPHER: You make a hell of a Frittata.
LORELAI: Well it is my specialty what time?
CHRISTOPHER: Around sixish.
LORELAI: Alright I might make a Frittata for dinner.
CHRISTOPHER: Ooh, sounds good.
LORELAI: Have a great day, honey.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye, hon. [Chris walks off, then returns] So what'd you think?
LORELAI: Frittata?
CHRISTOPHER: Felt pretty good, huh?
LORELAI: No, it did. It's homey. Home-ish. Home-like. Margaret, what did you think?
MARGARET: Oh, you seemed like real people in a real house.
LORELAI: Wow. What about the lighting?
MARGARET: Well as you can see there's lots of windows, lots of natural sunlight.
LORELAI: But how do we look?
MARGARET: Excuse me?
LORELAI: In the lighting, how do we look?
MARGARET: Oh, right. At least 10 years younger.
LORELAI: Than...
MARGARET: Hmm?
LORELAI: Well, if you think we're 60 and the lighting makes us look 50, then this room is aging us, and that's not good.
MARGARET: You look 20.
LORELAI: Very good!
MARGARET: This house was originally built in 1790 but obviously has been completely remodeled. All new appliances. Three fireplaces. Proximity to an excellent school district. The large backyard. Great tree-house-building trees.
LORELAI: Ooh, fun.
MARGARET: So I'm gonna make a quick call. Take your time. Look around. Make yourselves at home. Well, I don't have to tell you two that. I'll be right outside so just holler if you have any questions.
LORELAI: Thank you. We will.
CHRISTOPHER: So...
LORELAI: So?
CHRISTOPHER: I told you it was a really cool house.
LORELAI: It is.
CHRISTOPHER: And that yard?
LORELAI: Oh, love the yard.
CHRISTOPHER: And I know it's not Stars Hollow, but it's a really cool town and bigger. Lots of places to eat and shop.
LORELAI: Three bookstores? I mean this is a well-read community. We might be the dumbest people in town.
CHRISTOPHER: Yep we could be the town dunces. We'll buy caps.
LORELAI: We'll put "the dunces" on our mailbox.
CHRISTOPHER: That mailbox!
LORELAI: What is that, a hollowed-out Birch tree or something?
CHRISTOPHER: And the second-floor bedroom -- that's perfect for Gigi And the third-floor room – with the really cool windows that could be Rory's room.
LORELAI: Honey, I can't imagine a better house.
UNKNOWN HOUSE – EXTERIOR
[Lorelai and Chris exit the house]
LORELAI: Big front yard.
CHRISTOPHER: Could be our front yard.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. [Chris looks at Lorelai] What's with the face?
LORELAI: Face? What face? My face, you don't like my face?
CHRISTOPHER: Lor.
LORELAI: Hmm?
CHRISTOPHER: You want to stay in Stars Hollow.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: You want to stay in your house. You don't want to move at all.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay.
LORELAI: Yeah?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah…It's a hell of a mailbox, though.
LORELAI: Sure is.
OPENING CREDITS
GILMORE MANSION
[The front door rings and Emily opens it]
EMILY: You're here.
LORELAI: I'm here!
EMILY: You're 37 minutes late, but you're here.
LORELAI: Uh, traffic.
EMILY: It's Sunday morning Lorelai. The roads are empty.
LORELAI: Well let me finish, mom. Traffic cones everywhere. I mean you wouldn't believe it's like a crazy obstacle course out there. It's a miracle I survived. Maybe we should do this another day when I'm less stressed from the traffic-cone dodging.
EMILY: I have the most exciting news.
LORELAI: You're canceling my wedding party?
EMILY: I got Randall Farber as your party planner.
LORELAI: And he's canceling my wedding party?
EMILY: He spent the last 15 years as designer-in-residence at the Connecticut opera house.
LORELAI: Boss.
EMILY: This is a real coup, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Well…
EMILY: Your father and I have been fans of his work for years, and he's only just g*n designing parties. Two months ago we went to Abigail Hirschfeld's granddaughter's bat mitzvah,
LORELAI: Mm-hmm
EMILY: And it was the most spectacular event. The whole decor was inspired by Britten's "a midsummer night's dream." I swear I felt like I was in an enchanted forest the entire night, except for the children running around with braces. Randall, this is my daughter, Lorelai. Lorelai, Randall Farber.
LORELAI: Hello.
RANDALL: Ah, the star of our show.
LORELAI: Oh, well...
EMILY: I apologize for her tardiness. It's rather habitual.
RANDALL: Oh, stop. You're talking to an opera man. I've worked with Renée Fleming. The personality of a pit bull, that one, but all is forgiven when she sings, am I right.
LORELAI: Well, heads-up, I'm not much of an outside-the-shower singer.
EMILY: I hope you realize how lucky you are to have Randall, Lorelai. He's a genius.
RANDALL: Oh, stop. [Leading them into the dining room] Shall we?
LORELAI: Please.
[Now in the dinning room]
RANDALL: Well the first order of business is deciding on a theme around which I can design the evening.
LORELAI: How about "man's inhumanity to man"? It always worked well for my term papers in high school.
EMILY: Why don't you show us what you're thinking?
RANDALL: Well I've done a few mock-up tables. Just tell me which one jumps out at you.
LORELAI: Um, they all jump out at me. Kind of aggressively.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Well I just don't want it to be a big production, mom. It's just a party.
RANDALL: My dear, every party's a production. If it's a lousy production, it's a lousy party and everyone leaves by 8:30.
LORELAI: What about that as a theme? "Everyone leaves by 8:30."
EMILY: Tell me about this one.
LUKE'S DINER
KIRK: You've got you stocking plaid, your festive ornament collage your snowman trio, your Peekaboo Santa.
MISS PATTY: Well it's lovely, Kirk, but I already bought my wrapping paper from the kids from the Stars Hollow middle school.
KIRK: Well, then, you got ripped off.
MISS PATTY: What?
KIRK: Those kids are gouging you. I'm selling the same wrapping paper for 20% less.
LUKE: Aren't the kids selling the wrapping paper to help raise money for a new gymnasium?
KIRK: Yeah.
LUKE: Well, why are you?
KIRK: To raise money for myself. I'm not a school, Luke. No one's raising money for me. I saw the opportunity to enter the market at a lower price point and I took it.
MISS PATTY: Ho, ho, ho.
KIRK: What schoolchildren are the only ones allowed to sell wrapping paper? It's a free country. [A kid comes into the diner] Hey, Jacob! b*at it. This is my territory.
JACOB: Fathead.
KIRK: Yeah, keep walking.
LIZ: Look who's here.
MISS PATTY: Oh, my god!
LIZ: She's precious.
MISS PATTY: Oh, those eyes, that skin -- she's gorgeous.
LIZ: That's what everyone says.
LUKE: Hey, Liz.
LIZ: Hi, Luke.
LUKE: Oh, she's bigger.
LIZ: 11 pounds, 4 ounces.
LUKE: Oh she looks great.
LIZ: I know. She's really strong, too. She can practically hold her head up. Most kids don't do that until they're two months.
LUKE: Really
LIZ: Yeah.
LUKE: Come on over and sit down.
LIZ: Oh, sure. [They move to the counter] Oh he's really strong to she takes after T.J., he's really strong you know. We've been watching "Survivor" sometimes, you know, and he does the challenges, you know like standing on one leg or dragging the sandbags around, and he lasts longer than the guys on the show.
LUKE: Wow.
KIRK: You know, baby's first Christmas is approaching. Have you given thought to what baby's first Christmas gift will be wrapped in?
LIZ: No.
KIRK: I have baby Santa, cuddly reindeers, Frosty's world…
LUKE: Kirk.
KIRK: Yeah, okay. [He leaves]
LIZ: So is April excited about being a cousin?
LUKE: Yeah. I showed her the pictures you sent. She's gonna frame the one of her in the orange jumper.
LIZ: Oh, that is such a good one! [Laughter] She looks like a little creamsicle.
LUKE: [Laughs]
LIZ: She's very photogenic, huh?
LUKE: Yeah.
LIZ: And how are things with Anna?
LUKE: Yeah we're trading calls. It'll work out. I mean, I've calmed down a little since the fight. It'll all work itself out.
LIZ: I'm sure.
LUKE: Actually, I made a list. Okay I think it's pretty reasonable. Alright I was thinking I could have April either Thanksgiving or Christmas -- Anna can choose. One month of the summer. And I think I would like April to come to Stars Hollow one weekend every other month. In between, I can travel to New Mexico. I mean that sounds fair, right?
LIZ: Very reasonable. But I definitely think you need to get a lawyer.
LUKE: No lawyers. Anna and I are gonna work this out on our own.
LIZ: That's what you think now, big brother, but trust me -- custody issues are tough.
LUKE: Well, I don't like lawyers.
LIZ: Well, nobody does. Wait. She's staring at you. She is! She's staring at you, and she's falling asleep. Great. I'm gonna leave her with you, and I'll be back in an hour.
LUKE: What?
LIZ: Oh, I'm going crazy. I just need a minute to myself.
LUKE: Liz...
LIZ: She's been attached to my boob for two weeks, and T.J.'s decided to finally get a "work ethic."
LUKE: You can't just leave her here. I can't watch her.
LIZ: I fed her. She'll be fine. She'll sleep the whole time.
LUKE: [now panicking a little] Wait, Liz…
LIZ: I'll be back in an hour, maybe an hour and a half.
[Luke looks a little worried as the door closes.]
GILMORE MANSION – DINNING ROOM
[They are still looking at tables]
RANDALL: So why don't we take our inspiration from the world of "la bohme," fin de sicle Paris? A little birdie told me you had quite the romantic Parisian adventure.
EMILY: Tweet, tweet.
RANDALL: I must confess -- this is my personal favorite. I must admit I have a soft spot, for it was while I was doing "la bohme" at the staatsoper in Vienna that I met the incomparable Franco Zeffirelli, whose meticulous attention to detail has been a yardstick for which I measure all my work.
EMILY: Your details are simply astounding, Randall.
LORELAI: What about instead of "la bohme," we took our inspiration from "rent" -- east village, 1985, rickety tables, chipped glassware... [Cell phone rings]
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Excuse me. [Answers her cell phone] Hello?
RORY: How goes the party planning?
LORELAI: What? What happened?
RORY: That good, huh?
LORELAI: Is he okay?
RORY: I'm not participating in this.
LORELAI: Oh, my god. What can I do? What do you need?
RORY: You're not using this call to get out of party-planning hell.
LORELAI: Oh, I'll be right there.
RORY: Mom!
EMILY: I can hear Rory
on the other end, Lorelai.
You're not as clever
as you think you are.
LORELAI: [Too Rory] You rat. [Holds up the phone]
RORY: Hi, grandma.
EMILY: Hello, Rory. [too Randall] That's my granddaughter, Rory. Delightful girl. She's a senior at Yale.
RANDALL: Fantastic theater program -- Meryl, Jodie.
LORELAI: [Back on the phone] Uh, I thought we had a deal.
RORY: We had no deal.
LORELAI: No, a deal for life. You've got my back. I've got yours.
RORY: I plan on having a good time at your wedding party. More importantly, I plan on making sure you have a good time at your wedding party. Therefore, it's important you be involved in the planning, of you wedding party so in the big picture, I do very much have your back.
LORELAI: Yeah, whatever.
RORY: Okay. Bad news. I'm afraid I have to bail on you and dad for dinner tonight.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Logan?
RORY: Yeah, he's coming to stay with me for a couple days. He's been so busy with the start up, I've hardly gotten to see him lately.
LORELAI: Okay can't see you through the phone, but I'm pouting.
RORY: I'll make it up to you.
LORELAI: Hey is he coming to the party? I'm trying to pad the guest list if he's coming, I'm in the double digits.
RORY: He'll be there.
LORELAI: Awesome.
RORY: So okay, I'll call you later, okay?
LORELAI: The stairs are rickety, and you think you might fall down them?
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: The pool is empty, and you've hit your head?
RORY: Goodbye.
LORELAI: Okay, bye.
EMILY: Lorelai, come look at these invitations.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Can we just send an Evite?... No? Okay.
DOOSE'S MARKET
[Lorelai and Chris are shopping]
LORELAI: Two hours we spent picking out invitations. Two hours.
CHRISTOPHER: Wow.
LORELAI: Not counting the one hour we spent picking out the calligraphy -- for a party.
[Lorelai puts pop tarts into the cart]
CHRISTOPHER: This is gonna be some shindig.
[Chris puts the pop tarts back on the shelf without Lorelai seeing]
LORELAI: "Would you like the brown card with the cream-colored detail and the parchment insert, or would you like the cream-colored card with the silk lining and the clear paper insert?" How about I'd like some cyanide and a 30-story building to jump off of?
CHRISTOPHER: Ah no, we said one sugar cereal.
LORELAI: You're gonna deny me the captain?
CHRISTOPHER: We've got a whole box of Froot Loops at home.
LORELAI: [pouting] In my fragile state you're gonna deny me peanut butter Cap'n crunch?
CHRISTOPHER: It rips your gums...
LORELAI: In a delightful, sugary way. Look it's got 5% real peanut-butter- flavored chemicals.
CHRISTOPHER: No.
LORELAI: Oh, fine. Corn flakes.
CHRISTOPHER: Which one do we get again?
LORELAI: Avoid the words "made with real vegetables." I cannot take another day of Emily and Randall, and I have nine more days of it. That's nine more days than I can take.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, you're doing great.
LORELAI: I'm not doing great. I'm going nuts. Tomorrow we have the food-and-wine tasting at the Mildred Manor ballroom.
CHRISTOPHER: At least you get to drink your way through it.
LORELAI: No. Fancy people make you spit out the wine. That's what fancy people do. But not me. I'm gonna drink them under the ballroom.
CHRISTOPHER: What time's the tasting?
LORELAI: 3:30 till the end of never.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I've got a meeting in Hartford at 2:00, but I can meet you there afterward.
LORELAI: Really?
CHRISTOPHER: Yes.
LORELAI: Honey, that would be so great. I will never eat peanut butter Cap'n crunch again. Yes, I will. That's a lie. But together, we can defeat them.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey this is serious I don't want to get the wrong-colored deck mint parchment insert. The guys at the gym would never let me live it down.
LORELAI: No.
CHRISTOPHER: Well we got everything?
LORELAI: Yeah, we're good. Oh, no.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: Bonnie.
CHRISTOPHER: Who?
LORELAI: Taylor's niece, Bonnie, working the register. She couldn't be slower or care less about her job.
CHRISTOPHER: I thought life in a small town was supposed to be leisurely.
LORELAI: There's leisurely, and then there's Bonnie. [Sighs] We're never gonna get out of here.
CHRISTOPHER: Go wait outside.
LORELAI: Really?
CHRISTOPHER: Go.
LORELAI: [Clicks tongue] Honey, buy me Tic Tacs. Hi, bonnie.
BONNIE: What's up, Lorelai?
LORELAI: That's cabbage, hon.
BONNIE: Um... I'm gonna need a void here.
DOOSE'S MARKET – EXTERIOR
[Lorelai comes out just as Luke is walking Doula in her stroller past the store]
LORELAI: [Noticing Luke] Hi.
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: Who's -- who's this?
LUKE: That's Liz's baby.
LORELAI: Oh, wow. Congratulations. You're an uncle again, huh?
LUKE: Yeah, thanks.
LORELAI: Oh. Well, she's cute. She looks just like T.J.
LUKE: Hopefully she will grow out of that.
LORELAI: She's adorable. She's sweet. So what's her name?
LUKE: Doula.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Doula.
LORELAI: Oh, is that...
LUKE: A weird name.
LORELAI: Weird name. A little bit. But, no, it's special. It's one-of-a-kind, distinctive. Can I?
LUKE: Oh, sure, of course.
LORELAI: [Leans in and pick up Doula] Hi. Hi, bubby. Hi. Oh, precious. How old is she? Two weeks?
LUKE: 11 days.
LORELAI: Oh, wow. And how's Liz?
LUKE: Oh, they're great. They're both doing great. They're gonna make very strange parents but you know good ones, I know.
LORELAI: Nothing wrong with a strange but loving household.
LUKE: Yeah, I guess.
LORELAI: Look at her long fingers.
LUKE: Yeah, I noticed that, too.
LORELAI: What are you gonna be -- a pianist when you grow up? Is that what you're gonna be, pretty girl? Or a pickpocket. Well, yes, you might. You might be a pickpocketing pianist.
LUKE: Oh, look what she did.
[Chris comes out of Doose's and looks at them for a few seconds]
LUKE: [Laughs]
LORELAI: Pretty.
LUKE: She's trying to take my finger.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey. Look. It's Liz's new baby.
CHRISTOPHER: Cute.
LORELAI: Yeah. Well, thanks, um, for letting me..
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Hold her. And tell Liz congratulations for me, okay?
LUKE: Will do.
LORELAI: Alright see you.
LUKE: See you.
LORELAI: Want me to…
CHRISTOPHER: I got it.
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: [Too lorelai] Looks good on you...
YALE – CAFETERIA
[Rory and Logan are waiting in line]
LORELAI: We don't have to eat here.
RORY: Oh, yes, we do. You're on my turf now.
LOGAN: Your turf?
RORY: My turf.
LOGAN: You know, I did go to school here.
RORY: Yeah, you graduated from Yale. You can eat from their cafeteria at least once.
LOGAN: I stopped by for the occasional bowl of cereal.
RORY: Yeah cereal does not count. Okay you need to get something hot, mushy, and meaty.
LOGAN: You're not making it sound too appetizing.
RORY: Oh, it's not. I have an extra family pass from parents' weekend.
LOGAN: Oh, so when your parents came, they got to eat real food?
RORY: Mm-hmm I'm gonna tell them that you're my brother and that you're gonna get your meal comped.
LOGAN: I don't mind paying for my mushy meat.
RORY: No, that's not the issue. I mean I know how to work the system.
LOGAN: Oh, you do.
RORY: Yeah, you know me -- I can be crafty.
LOGAN: You can make a necklace out of macaroni, but this is high-stakes deception.
RORY: What's my middle name? Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.
DENNIS: Card.
RORY: There you go. And this is my family pass for my brother here.
BRANDON: Logan! What's up, brother? What they hell are you doing here, I thought you moved to London to run the world or something.
LOGAN: Just back for a visit.
RORY: My brother went here, too.
BRANDON: Is this your girlfriend, Rory?
LOGAN: I don't know. Is it?
RORY: [Too Dennis] Um I'm a terrible liar.
DENNIS: Ah-ha
LOGAN: Apparently so.
RORY: So hi. I'm Rory.
BRANDON: Brandon. Nice to meet you.
RORY: You too. So, Dennis, how much is a lunch pass?
DENNIS: $9.75.
LOGAN: So you're still with Nicole?
BRANDON: Yeah, till I die or she k*ll me.
LOGAN: Well, give her my best.
BRANDON: Will do, buddy. Good to see you, Logan.
LOGAN: You too.
BRANDON: Nice to meet you, Rory.
RORY: You too. Bye.
LOGAN: [Too Rory] Smooth.
RORY: Shut up.
LOGAN: Way to work the system.
RORY: You totally left me hanging there.
LOGAN: What could I do? You were working the system. In fact, you were working the system so well, I think the system needs a day off.
RORY: I'll have the chicken, and he'll have the meat loaf with extra gravy.
LOGAN: Nice.
RORY: Mm-hmm. Oh, hey, there's Lucy. Lucy!
LUCY: Hi! You must be Rory's imaginary boyfriend, Logan.
LOGAN: Hi, Lucy.
LUCY: Hi. I would give you a proper hug, but my pockets are full of apple jacks. I have art history in a few minutes, and my professor sounds like Garrison Keillor on Quaaludes, so I need a constant intake of sugar just to stay awake.
LOGAN: I was just treating Logan to his first Branford dining hall meat loaf.
LUCY: Oh, you're in for a treat and a stomachache.
LOGAN: I can tell.
LUCY: So congratulations on buying the Internet or something.
LOGAN: Thank you, although al gore and I are still negotiating so it‘s not a done deal yet.
RORY: It's too bad that you have class. You could have eaten with us.
LUCY: Sad. Hey, why don't we have dinner? I have a lecture tonight, but what about tomorrow night?
RORY: Sure.
LOGAN: Sounds good.
LUCY: Fun! We'll have to go to Panchali's. It's this new Indian restaurant right off campus. It's awesome and I swear no matter how much food you order, you cannot spend more than 7 bucks.
LOGAN: Sounds like stomachache number two.
RORY: Huh-huh
MARTY: [Entering the room] Hey, babe. Come on.
LUCY: Boyfriend! [Marty is surprised to see Logan and Rory, Lucy waves him over] Boyfriend, this is Rory's imaginary boyfriend, Logan.
LOGAN: I know Marty. How you doing, man?
MARTY: Hey.
LUCY: How do you two know each other?
MARTY: Oh we met when I was bartending one of Logan's parties.
LUCY: What a coinkydink.
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: More than one, he did a couple blowouts for me, and if I'm not mistaken, at the last one, cops were called.
MARTY: That sounds familiar.
LUCY: You know, you probably met Marty, too, and you just didn't even know it.
MARTY: We should go. I need to stop by the library before class.
LUCY: Right. Okay, bye, guys. We will see you tomorrow for Basmati and Vindaloo.
RORY: Okay. Bye.
LOGAN: Later.
RORY: Okay. Come on. [They go over to a table and sit] Is this okay?
LOGAN: Fine. So what's with the whole "you must have met Marty"?
RORY: Oh, I meant to tell you.
LOGAN: Tell me what?
RORY: It's kind of embarrassing. It's so juvenile and lame. It's like high school -- not even high school. It's junior high.
LOGAN: I'm listening.
RORY: Well, I've been hanging out with Lucy and Olivia and I keep hearing about Lucy's boyfriend, and they never actually said his name. And then when I finally met him, it was Marty. And before I could even say anything, he just pretended like we've never met. And I just didn't know what to do, so I went along with it, but now Lucy still doesn't know that we know each other. It's just kind of weird and awkward. And did I mention juvenile?
LOGAN: Why did you go along with it?
RORY: I don't know. It just happened so fast. I was caught off guard.
LOGAN: So why would he pretend not to know you?
RORY: I don't know. I mean, maybe because he used to like me, and maybe he still does a little. But that's stupid, because he's with Lucy now, and she's amazing. They're great together and it's all so annoying. I mean they don't call people by name. They don't call anyone by name, French-fry guy -- I don't know who that is. That could be you.
LOGAN: So what happened?
RORY: What do you mean?
LOGAN: Well he must have said or done something right to make you think he's still into you.
RORY: I don't know. He said I was beautiful. To me, he said it.
LOGAN: Well can't blame the guy for that. You are beautiful.
RORY: The way he said it.
LOGAN: Right.
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: So what? You guys have been hanging out?
RORY: No. No, I mean, just when he's around with Lucy.
LOGAN: So you have been hanging out.
RORY: Just with Lucy.
LOGAN: So why the secrecy?
RORY: I told you, I was caught off guard.
LOGAN: No, with me. Why did you never mention that you and Marty were hanging out again?
RORY: Oh I just didn't think it mattered.
LOGAN: Well you're not the secret-keeping type. Of course that is before I knew you were Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.
RORY: No, it wasn't a secret. I mean, I didn't tell you. That's it. I swear. I mean I didn't not tell you. I just didn't think there was anything to tell.
LOGAN: Well, you have to tell Lucy.
RORY: I know. I will. Just I need to figure out the right time and way to do it. I just don't want to screw anything up.
LOGAN: A little brotherly advice -- tell her sooner rather than later.
RORY: Yeah, I will. I'll figure something out. We don't have to go to dinner with them though. I can cancel that.
LOGAN: No, it's fine. We can go to dinner. Unless there's something on your end.
RORY: No. Logan, god, no.
LOGAN: Good. Then let's go to dinner.
RORY: Okay.
LOGAN: Really, they charge 10 bucks for this?
RORY: Hum



LORELAI'S HOUSE – BED ROOM
[Lorelai and Chris are in bed in each other arms.]
CHRISTOPHER: Let's make a baby.
LORELAI: What do you mean?
CHRISTOPHER: Seriously.
LORELAI: Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
CHRISTOPHER: Why not?
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: Why not?
LORELAI: Because we haven't talked about it at all -- ever.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, well, let's talk about it.
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: You want another kid, don't you?
LORELAI: Oh, god. Uh, I don't know. I, um... sure, maybe.
CHRISTOPHER: Me too. And, you know, last one turned out pretty good, so...
LORELAI: Last one didn't turn out pretty good. Last one came out and a lot of work went into getting her to pretty good.
CHRISTOPHER: You're right. You're right. I'm -- I'm sorry.
LORELAI: It's okay.
CHRISTOPHER: No, you're right. You're absolutely right. But, um, it's different now. We're adults. We're married. It'd be easier.
LORELAI: Yeah. I guess. I don't know. I think... I want… another… kid.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, well, we're on the same page. Let's go for it.
LORELAI: [Chris starts to kiss Lorelai] Honey... Chris... honey... seriously -- seriously, I don't want to go for it right now.
CHRISTOPHER: Why not?
LORELAI: Why not? We just got married. I mean, Gigi's not even back from France.
CHRISTOPHER: So you don't want to because of Gigi?
LORELAI: No, I mean, it's not because of Gigi
CHRISTOPHER: Because financially, we're good. We're set. We could have a thousand kids, feed them, send them to Harvard undergrad, law school.
LORELAI: No, I know.
CHRISTOPHER: Do you not think we'll work?
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: Because if that's what you're thinking, I mean it's a little late.
LORELAI: Oh, my god, no. That's not what I'm thinking. That's not what I'm thinking at all.
CHRISTOPHER: What are you thinking?
LORELAI: I just -- what is this? What is the rush? Why right now? [Chris exhales like he doesn't believe Lorelai.] Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. No, it's fine.
LORELAI: Honey...
CHRISTOPHER: No, you're right. We should we should wait. We should. You're right.
[Chris turns over with his back to Lorelai and goes to sleep]
LUKE'S DINER - DAYTIME
LUKE: Cesar, what time you got?
CAESAR: 10 after 2:00.
LUKE: As soon as April gets here, we're gonna have to run, 'cause we're gonna miss the movie.
CAESAR: I'm feeling you.
LUKE: Stop feeling me.
KIRK: So business has been going like gangbusters.
LUKE: Congratulations.
KIRK: Yeah, I'm destroying those Stars Hollow middle school kids. Destroying -- outselling them by three or four times. I think it's safe to say they won't be getting their new gym anytime soon.
LUKE: You must be very proud.
KIRK: I am. Sure there's been an increase in prank phone calls, but so what? I can answer the phone all day long.
LUKE: I'm sure.
KIRK: And so they've ordered pizzas to my house day and night. You know what? I love pizza. Bring it on. They think they're intimidating me, but I'm not scared.
LUKE: 12-year-olds don't scare you.
KIRK: Not at all.
JACOB: Kirk!
KIRK: I thought I told you to get lost.
JACOB: We want to talk.
[Short pause]
KIRK: So talk.
JACOB: Not here. Outside.
KIRK: All right. Let's go. [Luke picks up his pack of wrapping paper] But I'm warning you -- if it gets physical, I will show no mercy.
[Luke calls Anna, who is wrapping things fro Christmas.]
ANNA: Hello?
LUKE: Hey, Anna, it's Luke.
ANNA: Yeah.
LUKE: Yeah I was just wondering if April took off. She's not here yet, and she's never late. I'm just getting a little worried.
ANNA: April's fine.
LUKE: Is she on her way?
ANNA: No, she's not coming.
LUKE: What does that mean?
ANNA: Luke, you can't just come to my house, threaten me, and then expect me to send April off to see you.
LUKE: Look, things got a little heated the other night.
ANNA: Yes they certainly did, and I'm not comfortable with April being with you right now.
LUKE: Anna, wait…
ANNA: No, Luke, I won't, because this is my decision. Goodbye.
[Luke looks at the phone and is a little mad]
MILDRED MANOR BALLROOM
[Lorelai, Chris, Emily and Randall are there.]
RANDALL: So we moved away from a literal theme as per our star's request.
LORELAI: Star -- that's me.
CHRISTOPHER: [sounding a little annoyed] Yeah, I got it.
RANDALL: But we did manage to squeeze some favorite colors out of her, didn't we.
LORELAI: Yellow, like my sunny disposition.
RANDALL: Eh, eh, eh. Not yellow. Buttercup and buttercream.
LORELAI: Do you like buttercream and buttermilk, honey or would you like a nondairy color?
RANDALL: Please say you like them.
CHRISTOPHER: It's fine.
RANDALL: So of course this area will be for the tables, as discussed. The orchestra -- excuse me -- band will be over there. And obviously, the dance floor is right here.
LORELAI: Actually, I'm morally opposed to dancing, so that's not gonna work for me.
CHRISTOPHER: She's just kidding.
LORELAI: [Giggles]
RANDALL: Aha.
EMILY: I'm so glad you're here. Maybe you can help keep Lorelai's snarkiness in check.
CHRISTOPHER: Let's see what he's got planned.
RANDALL: So we still have to decide on the score. Have you made a list of your favorite music?
LORELAI: No list necessary. It's going to be Burt Bacharach and nothing but.
RANDALL: Really?
CHRISTOPHER: We'll make a list.
RANDALL: Wonderful.
LORELAI: [Too Chris] Hey, you okay?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. I'm fine.
RANDALL: Now, for the fish course, I believe we have either a Pouilly Fuissé or a Muscat, if you go with the salmon, and I do think you should go with the salmon.
EMILY: Agreed. Now, as far as the vows go…
LORELAI: [Coughs] I'm sorry. The vows?
EMILY: Wedding vows.
LORELAI: Ah what are you talking about?
EMILY: They can be traditional, or you can write your own, which seems to be the style now day, although if you ask me it's rather garish. Cecily Pendelem's daughter actually promised to cook her husband lasagna once a month. Who wants to hear the word "lasagna" at a wedding?
LORELAI: Well you make a good point but this is not a wedding. It's just a party.
EMILY: A party to celebrate a marriage, which is why a simple exchange of vows is entirely appropriate.
LORELAI: Mom, we agreed to a party, okay? Just a party.
EMILY: A wedding is a party.
LORELAI: Yes, but we are already married.
EMILY: Yes, and no one got to witness it. Did it ever occur to you that your father and I might like to see our only child get married?
LORELAI: [Begging voice] Christopher?
CHRISTOPHER: I don't think it's such a bad idea.
LORELAI: What?
[Emily looks on very happy]
CHRISTOPHER: Might be kind of nice.
LORELAI: Wait a minute. Is this an ambush and you guys ambushing me?
EMILY: No one is ambushing you, Lorelai. The idea of your exchanging vows in front of all your family and friends isn't so outrageous.
LORELAI: Mom, the whole reason we eloped is to avoid the wedding thing.
CHRISTOPHER: Ah now that's not the reason we eloped, we eloped because we love each other and we wanted to get married.
LORELAI: Well you know what I mean.
CHRISTOPHER: No, I don't.
LORELAI: Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: What is the big deal?
LORELAI: The big deal is I don't want to do it and we're already married.
CHRISTOPHER: So that's it.
LORELAI: Well...
CHRISTOPHER: I don't even know why I'm here. It's not like my opinion
really matters.
LORELAI: Of course it does.
CHRISTOPHER: You're gonna do what you want to do. House, wedding, kids -- it's all your call, right?
EMILY: Are you talking about having more children?
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: Wait! Are you pregnant?
LORELAI: No.
CHRISTOPHER: That's nice.
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: You don't have to act like it's the most horrible thing in the world.
LORELAI: Can we not talk about this now?
CHRISTOPHER: Why you don't want to be spur-of-the-moment? Lets discuss things.
EMILY: Randall perhaps we should give them some privacy.
RANDALL: Of course.
LORELAI: What is wrong with you?
CHRISTOPHER: What's wrong with you?
LORELAI: You're airing all our business in front of my mother of all people.
CHRISTOPHER: What is your problem with a wedding?
LORELAI: We're already married.
CHRISTOPHER: Exactly, so what's the big deal? You planned a huge wedding with that diner guy.
LORELAI: [mocking voice] "That diner guy"?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry should I be more respectful to the guy who punched me in the face?
LORELAI: Is that what this is about?
CHRISTOPHER: No, this is about us. At least that's what I thought, but apparently it's just about you.
LORELAI: What is that supposed to mean?
CHRISTOPHER: You know what? I'm going back to work.
LORELAI: No, no. Christopher, hey.
LAWYER'S OFFICE
[Luke and the lawyer]
LAWYER: So you want to sue for custody.
LUKE: No, I don't want to sue her. I just want... [gets a note from his pocket] this or something like this.
LAWYER: You want partial custody.
LUKE: Is that what that is?
LAWYER: Yeah.
LUKE: Yeah, fine. Then I want partial custody.
LAWYER: Then you have to sue for it.
LUKE: Really?
LAWYER: Really. But you're not gonna get this.
LUKE: Why not?
LAWYER: From everything you've just told me, this is a best-case scenario, and I'm not really in the best-case-scenario business.
LUKE: What does that mean?
LAWYER: It means you haven't been in April's life for the past 12 years.
LUKE: But that wasn't my fault. I didn't know she existed.
LAWYER: Doesn't matter.
LUKE: How can it not matter?
LAWYER: Because she has a history with her mother. This is not about what you want, Luke. This is not about what Anna wants. The court only cares what's best for April, and in these types of cases, they almost always side with the mother.
LUKE: So what can I do?
LAWYER: You can fight. You can make your case.
LUKE: Okay.
LAWYER: Okay. What about Anna's history?
LUKE: Anna's?
LAWYER: Any police records? Incidents?
LUKE: Uh, no.
LAWYER: Erratic behavior? Drugs? Alcohol?
LUKE: I don't think so.
LAWYER: So you don't know. Well we'll look into it. What about you?
LUKE: Hmm?
LAWYER: Any record?
LUKE: No. Well, yes, actually. I b*at up this guy's car this -- this one time. It was no big deal.
LAWYER: Did you attend anger-management classes?
LUKE: No.
LAWYER: Would you be willing to?
LUKE: I don't need to.
LAWYER: You might.
LUKE: Look... I don't want this to get ugly. I just want what's fair.
LAWYER: Custody battles get ugly, Luke, and they're not about what's fair. The truth is this will be long, it will be expensive, it will be unpleasant, and you'll probably lose. But if you want your daughter, it's the only way. And time is of the essence here, because once Anna moves April out of state, it becomes infinitely more complicated.
[Luke looks worried]
PANCHALI'S RESTAURANT
[Lucy, Marty, Logan and Rory are having dinner]
LUCY: So I beg and plead with him, he says he'll try and come but I'm afraid he won't, and I just can't wait any longer. So I take the ticket, and I go running off. I run all the way back to the theater. When I get there, I burst through the doors. There's sweat pouring off of me and I'm gasping for breath.
LOGAN: And everybody's gone?
LUCY: No, the director is still there.
LOGAN: No!
LUCY: I know, right.
MARTY: [Too Rory] Can you pass the Raita?
RORY: Sure.
LUCY: So I say to him, "you have to let me audition." And he says, "you can't audition, because the auditions are over." And I say, "the auditions can't be over, because I haven't auditioned yet." And he says, "you're two hours too late." And I say, "that's because I was in a traffic accident, and I have the cop to prove it." Just as I'm about to say, "and he'll be here any minute," and, you know, not really believing it, officer Frick comes waltzing through the door.
LOGAN: No!
LUCY: Like Fred Astaire.
LOGAN: Officer Frick came through.
LUCY: Officer Frick came through.
LOGAN: So you got the part?
LUCY: Oh, no. I was totally wrong for it. But officer Frick introduced me to his nephew Drew, and we went out a few times, so that was cool.
LOGAN: Lucy, hands down that is the best "dedicated to my craft" story I've ever heard.
LUCY: Why, thank you.
LOGAN: Hard-working and beautiful -- she's something special. You got yourself a good one here, Marty.
MARTY: Thanks.
LUCY: Oh Rory's got way better stories than I do.
LOGAN: Did she ever tell you about the time she drove out to her English lit professor's house in Albany to replace the last page of her final?
RORY: Well it was in the wrong font, and I got an "A" on that paper.
LOGAN: Wasn't that the professor who had a crush on you?
LUCY: Hey! Are you saying that she didn't deserve the "A"?
LOGAN: I'm just saying the woman is the object of many strange crushes.
RORY: Oh, that's not true.
LOGAN: The oddball who works at Baskin-Robbins? She can't walk within a block of the place without the guy running out with a triple scoop of mint chocolate chip.
RORY: So not true.
LUCY: [Laughs] Hey, she's something special.
RORY: Hey you know I put four pages of endnotes on that final. I deserved that "A."
LOGAN: I'm not saying you're not dedicated to your schoolwork. You're the hardest worker I know, see I was always about doing just enough, or maybe a little less.
LUCY: Well, look at you now, Mr. Slaving away.
LOGAN: It's true. My rep is ruined.
LUCY: Boyfriend works insanely hard.
LOGAN: Is that true, Marty?
MARTY: I just have a couple jobs.
LUCY: Four! The man has four jobs. And a full class load. It's nuts! Right, Rory?
RORY: It does seem a bit excessive.
MARTY: It's not four.
LUCY: Four. Rory?
RORY: I think so.
LUCY: Finnegan's, the bookstore, tutoring, and landscaping.
MARTY: The landscaping is seasonal. I haven't done that for months.
LUCY: But you will, and that will be four.
LOGAN: That's a lot of jobs, my boy.
MARTY: Hey, I'm just waiting for that trust fund to kick in. [Rory's napkin falls on the floor] I got it. There.
RORY: Thanks.
LOGAN: So how did you two meet?
LUCY: Tell him.
MARTY: What?
LUCY: Tell him!
MARTY: Why?
LUCY: He stalked me.
LOGAN: That's charming.
LUCY: I was playing Portia in "The Merchant of Venice" at the rep, and every night, I see this guy in the front row -- same seat, same intense gaze. And after the fifth show, I went up to him and I said, "next time I see you, you better bring flowers or have a knife and stab me." And...
MARTY: The next time I saw her, I had daisies and a butter knife.
LUCY: [Laughs]
LOGAN: Sweet.
LUCY: I can't believe I don't even know this. How did you two meet?
LOGAN: Actually, Marty introduced us.
LUCY: What?
LOGAN: I'm sorry. I can't be a part of this.
LUCY: A part of what?
RORY: Logan.
LOGAN: They've known each other since freshman year.
LUCY: I don't understand.
LOGAN: Rory and Marty, they used to hang out all the time at Branford and watch "Duck Soup."
LUCY: What are you talking about? W-what is he talking about?
MARTY: Lucy…
LUCY: You guys know each other?
RORY: Yes.
MARTY: It was freshman year. It's no big deal.
LUCY: You've been keeping this from me? Why? I-I don't understand. You guys are friends? You know each other?
RORY: I'm sorry, Lucy.
MARTY: We just didn't think…
LUCY: So you both have been lying to me about this? I don't understand. Why? For what?
MARTY: I don't know.
LUCY: Oh, my god. This is so messed up. I have to go.
MARTY: Lucy...[Followers her out]
RORY: What is wrong with you?
LOGAN: I was asked a direct question. I'm not gonna lie. She's a nice girl.
RORY: Yeah, I know she's a nice girl. She's my friend.
LOGAN: You were gonna tell her anyway.
RORY: Not here. Not like this. You totally humiliated her.
LOGAN: Lucy's humiliated because of what you and Marty did to her, not me. I told her the truth, which is something she could use more of from her supposed friend and her boyfriend.
RORY: I can't believe you're trying to justify this. What you did was so obnoxious.
LOGAN: I was just being honest. I'm just gonna head back into the city tonight. I've got a lot of work to do tomorrow.
RORY: Fine.
DRAGONFLY INN – LINEN CLOSET
[Lorelai is counting, her cell phone rings]
LORELAI: [Goes to the phone] Ooh. [Answers the phone] Hi. 143.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I want to talk to you, but I'm gonna lose count, so remember 143.
RORY: 143 what?
LORELAI: Soaps.
RORY: What are you doing?
LORELAI: Inventory.
RORY: At the inn?
LORELAI: No, at the pentagon. I'm tracking soaps and nuclear m*ssile for general Abizaid.
RORY: Isn't it a little late?
LORELAI: The general's a slave driver.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Well it had to get done at some point, so I thought I'd do it at this point. I count better at night.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: So what's going on? I thought it was an all-Logan week.
RORY: It was.
LORELAI: Was?
RORY: Boys suck.
LORELAI: Oh, hon.
RORY: They totally suck.
LORELAI: Sometimes they do.
RORY: Tell me it gets better when they get older.
LORELAI: It gets better when they get older.
RORY: It does?
LORELAI: Well, it gets more confusing, more complicated, and more complex. Does any of that sound better?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: So what happened?
RORY: It was awful. We went to dinner with Lucy and Marty, and I told him everything beforehand -- about how Marty pretended that we didn't know each other and I just had to go with it.
LORELAI: Uh-oh.
RORY: Yeah. So right in the middle of dinner, he decides that he can't lie to Lucy, and he tells her Marty and I have known each other since freshman year.
LORELAI: Yikes!
RORY: I know. Who does that, right? Right in the middle of dinner. He has no reason to be jealous. I mean, he knows that I love him.
LORELAI: Of course he does.
RORY: So why would he do it?
LORELAI: I have no idea. Mars and Venus, you know?
RORY: Yeah, see, I don't think that's right. Because Mars and Venus are both planets, right? So they have something in common. I think it's more like Mars and a bowl of soup.
LORELAI: Venus and a bowl of soup.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Venus is the woman. Venus and a bowl of soup.
RORY: Really, mom?
LORELAI: Well, I'm just saying. So um, how's Lucy?
RORY: I don't know. Not good. She ran out. And I've been trying to call her, but she won't answer her phone. I don't blame her I mean wouldn't want to talk to me right now.
LORELAI: Oh, she'll be fine. She probably just needs time to cool down, you know.
RORY: Yeah, I hope so. I mean, I feel terrible.
LORELAI: Of course you do. You want to come home? I'm about to start counting dust ruffles.
RORY: No. I should actually probably go over there and try, you know? See if she'll talk to me in person.
LORELAI: All right. Let me know what happens.
RORY: Yeah, I will. 143.
LORELAI: Ah, thank you. Sorry boys suck.
RORY: Yeah, stupid bowls of soup.
CASEY'S BAR – NIGHT
[Chris is drinking alone, the bar is empty, "The Joker" is playing. The bar tender comes and give Chris the tab, Chris pays, then leaves]
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE NIGHT
[Chris walks to his car from the bar. Chris sees Luke's truck pulls up outside the diner and he gets out, the guy's lock eyes "Show down in Stars Hollow" style. Chris starts to walk toward Luke, Luke waits a few seconds and starts heading to Chris. Chris rips of his scarf and Luke takes of his leather jacket. Chris swings and misses Luke, Luke hits Chris and he goes down! Luke throws him against a Christmas display, which falls over. Chris tackles Luke and they wrestle on the ground. They get up and wrestle some more before Luke gets in 2 more punches sending Chris to the ground. They are both breathing heavily. Chris gets up and charges Luke "Ungh!", sending them into the Christmas tree. It is knocked over and "We wish you a merry Christmas" starts to play from the display. Chris gets up and jumps Luke and they wrestle some more. They both struggle to get up. "Deck the halls" starts to play. They both circle and eye each other off before walking away]
YALE – HALLWAY
[Rory knocks on Lucy's door]
RORY: Hey. Is Lucy here?
OLIVIA: She's here.
RORY: Can I see her?
OLIVIA: She doesn't want to see you right now, and, to be honest, neither do I.
RORY: Olivia, just let me explain, please.
OLIVIA: No.
[Olivia shuts the door, Rory walks away starting to cry]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
[Night, Lorelai drives up, gets out of her Jeep and goes to the house]
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Oh, my god! Mom, you scared me half to death. What are you doing here?
EMILY: I want to talk to you, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Ugh. Is this about the party? Because I've had a really long day, and I don't want to talk about the party.
EMILY: It's not about the party. I've come to talk to you about your marriage.
LORELAI: My marriage?
EMILY: Yes, I'm concerned. I don't like what I'm seeing, and I've come to offer you some friendly advice.
LORELAI: Mom, I really don't want your advice.
EMILY: Well, then consider it unfriendly advice.
LORELAI: Okay.
EMILY: Christopher is immature, often foolish, and a little lacking in common sense. He doesn't always make the best choices.
LORELAI: Like with me? Are you saying he chose wrongly in choosing me?
EMILY: I'm saying he's your husband, Lorelai, for better or for worse. I like Christopher.
LORELAI: Okay.
EMILY: I think he's good for you. But it's not going to be perfect. He's not perfect, and god knows you're not perfect. But marriage is not about always being happy, and often it's about not being happy at all. It's about compromise, which is not your strong suit. Marriage is about swallowing your pride sometimes, about doing what he wants. It's not about winning an argument, which may make you sad, because that's what you love. But I don't want to see you ruin this. Marriage is serious business, Lorelai, and if you don't take this very seriously, then this whole thing could fall apart faster than you could possibly imagine. And he'll be gone, and you'll be alone again. A ring is no guarantee. [They exchange looks for a second] Sorry for scaring you.
[Emily leaves Lorelai to think about it]

LORELAI'S HOUSE – LORELAI'S BED ROOM
[Lorelai is pacing and looking out the window]
LORELAI: [Gasps] Ooh!
[Sees a car pull up in the drive way. Runs down stairs to the front door shouting]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
LORELAI: The redcoats are coming! The redcoats are coming!
GIGI: The redcoats are coming!
CHRISTOPHER: Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, missy. Got to put on your jacket first, okay?
[Lorelai runs outside]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
LORELAI: Hi!
RORY: Hi!
LORELAI: I'm so mad at you!
RORY: What kind of greeting is that?
LORELAI: What kind of daughter doesn't let her mother pick her up at the airport?
RORY: The kind who parks her car at the airport car park.
LORELAI: But I'm the kind of mother who picks her daughter up at the airport, you know with flowers and coffee and a fake chauffeur's sign. Why would you mess with my sense of self?
ORY: My car was parked at the airport car park.
LORELAI: So what, I could have driven to the airport, picked you up, brought you back. Then we both could have driven to pick up your car and come here.
RORY: Yeah 'cause that wouldn't be a waste of gas or anything.
LORELAI: [picking up a bag] Oh, god. Did you pack Big Ben? I still think it was kind of risky.
RORY: What's risky?
LORELAI: Well you've spent a lot of time across the pond. You might get confused and forget which side of the road to drive on.
RORY: Yeah it was a near escape.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey! Welcome home!
GIGI: The redcoat is here!
RORY: Hi, dad!
CHRISTOPHER: How are you doing?
RORY: Good. [they kiss] Hi, little sister. Oh, hello. Okay. Oh. [Gigi is holding on to her leg] Oh. Well, all right.
[Laughs]
CHRISTOPHER: So, you made it here okay?
RORY: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: I was thinking -- all that time in England, you might forget which side of the road to drive on.
LORELAI: Hey, don't steal my material.
CHRISTOPHER: What do you mean, your material?
LORELAI: I just made that joke.
CHRISTOPHER: They driving on the other side of the road thing, that's my joke. If you just made it, you ripped me off.
LORELAI: I ripped you off?
RORY: Guys.
LORELAI: That's like saying Lenny Bruce rips off carrot top or Woody Allen gets his material from what's his name -- the guy with the watermelons.
CHRISTOPHER: I did not rip you off -- no way, no how, sister. I made that joke this morning at breakfast. When we were sitting there. We were drinking coffee.
RORY: Guys, not that that's not a hilarious joke, but the guy at the car park made the same one. Hey, Gigi, Would you want to take this inside for me? [Handing her a small bag]
GIGI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Geege.
RORY: Ohh!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: You took the Christmas lights down.
LORELAI: I didn't take them down. I haven't put them up yet. I saved Christmas for you.
RORY: You…
LORELAI: Before you left we said we were gonna wait and do Christmas together.
RORY: Okay, yeah, but…
LORELAI: [Noticing the earrings Rory is wearing] What are those?
RORY: What are what?
LORELAI: Are those a Christmas present from Logan?
RORY: No, I mean -- well, yeah, but it's more like a late birthday/new year's present. What stop sniffing me.
LORELAI: I smell Christmas cookies.
RORY: Well there's no way you can smell cookies from six days ago.
LORELAI: So there were Christmas cookies.
RORY: There may have been a little Christmas.
LORELAI: Unbelievable!
RORY: London, as a city, is very Christmas-obsessed. Okay I couldn't help what was going on around me. But inside, I assure you, I was devoid of the Christmas spirit -- a complete scrooge.
LORELAI: I didn't let any Christmas happen. I grinched it up so hard, I didn't even let it snow.
RORY: What it hasn't snowed yet?
LORELAI: Thanks to me thinking of you and our agreement, our pledge, out oath.
RORY: You stopped the snow?
LORELAI: Yes sheer force of will. We said we would have no Christmas, so I had no Christmas.
RORY: You must have had a little Christmas.
LORELAI: None.
RORY: What no presents?
LORELAI: No presents.
RORY: No tree?
LORELAI: No tree.
RORY: No eggnog?
LORELAI: No egg, no nog. I sat in the dark with the lights off and ate gruel.
RORY: Okay, mom.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: I hereby apologize for any accidental Christmas celebrating I may have done. I'm now ready to celebrate Christmas for real.
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Okay!
[Laughter]
RORY: So, you stopped the snow?
LORELAI: Yeah. I did an anti-snow dance. It was humiliating and arguaus, but I had made a promise to my daughter.
RORY: Humiliating?
LORELAI: Two words -- coconut bra.
OPENING CREDITS
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Chris, Rory, Gigi and Lorelai enter]
CHRISTOPHER: Where am I taking this?
LORELAI: Living room.
RORY: I love our trees!
GIGI: Me too!
CHRISTOPHER: You don't think our trees are...
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: Maybe a little homely?
LORELAI: Homely?!
CHRISTOPHER: I'm just saying.
RORY: What!
LORELAI: What are you saying?
CHRISTOPHER: That our trees are not classically good-looking. I mean if you were to look up "tree" in the dictionary, you would not find one of these fellows.
LORELAI: Why would you look up "tree" in the dictionary?
RORY: So we don't have classically good-looking trees.
LORELAI: You don't know what a tree is.
RORY: Come on look at that tree.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm looking.
RORY: That tree has character.
LORELAI: It does.
RORY: That tree has earned character by persevering through freezing winters and forest fires and floods.
LORELAI: This tree's a fighter.
RORY: Woodpeckers, I mean maniacal woodpeckers just pecking at its trunk.
LORELAI: Survivor.
RORY: Peck, peck, peck, day in and day out.
LORELAI: That tree's a champion.
RORY: [changing her tone and smiling] It smells so good in here with all our trees.
LORELAI: It's like a dozen car air fresheners.
RORY: Just imagine how good it's gonna be once all our trees are here.
CHRISTOPHER: This is crazy!
LORELAI: Seven trees.
CHRISTOPHER: Which was crazy.
LORELAI: What? Buck a tree.
RORY: Dad, we have to have at least one tree in the kitchen.
GIGI: Yeah, dad.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm in a forest of crazy.
RORY: Hm-hmm.
LORELAI: Buck a tree.
RORY: Genius.
LORELAI: So genius we better be careful, or word will get out and everyone will start celebrating Christmas after Christmas, which will really drive up the post-Christmas Christmas-tree prices.
RORY: Then we'll have to keep celebrating later and later.
LORELAI: Yeah before we know it, we'll be having Figgy pudding in July. Look! Gigi! You know who made this? Rory. Rory made this when she was right about your age.
GIGI: That's nice.
RORY: Someone's not impressed.
LORELAI: Well she doesn't understand abstract art.
RORY: Philistine.
LORELAI: Hey, look at this. Here's Santa's costume. Wow. That's seen better days.
GIGI: Why do you have Santa's clothes?
LORELAI: Because...I...used to do Santa's dry cleaning.
GIGI: You did?
LORELAI: Yeah.
GIGI: Wow.
LORELAI: I know.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay, everybody can relax. There's now a Christmas tree in the kitchen.
LORELAI: Thank you.
RORY: Oh! My antlers! I love my antlers!
GIGI: Oh, neat! Let me try!
RORY: Wow, okay.
GIGI: [running off to the kitchen] On vixen! On blisters!…
RORY: Kid took my antlers, she took my antlers and galloped away.
LORELAI: Alright now tell me more about London. Did everything work out with Logan after the whole Marty/Lucy/dinner debacle?
RORY: Well I was pretty angry for a while, especially after he blurted out all that stuff the way he did, but he apologized a lot and even admitted that he was a little jealous, so I forgave him.
LORELAI: Well, that's good.
RORY: Yeah well, plus I realized a lot of it was my fault. I was Lucy's friend. I should have been straight with her about knowing Marty. I can't believe I got suckered into that whole thing I mean for so long. I don't blame her for hating me.
LORELAI: Have you talked to her now?
RORY: I've left messages.
LORELAI: Oh, hon.
[Entering room]
CHRISTOPHER: Wow! Look at all this!
LORELAI: Yeah, we have a lot of Christmas stuff.
CHRISTOPHER: Cool. Mistletoe.
LORELAI: Where are you going?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm gonna hang it up in the doorway.
RORY: Oh, that's not where it goes.
CHRISTOPHER: Where does it go?
RORY: We tape it up to one of the blades of the ceiling fan upstairs. That way, the kissing is more like a sport.
LORELAI: One of our traditions.
CHRISTOPHER: That's a tradition?
RORY: Our traditions are important to us.
CHRISTOPHER: What other traditions am I in for?
RORY: On Christmas morning, we put red and green M&M's in our cereal.
CHRISTOPHER: Down with that.
RORY: We string up our stockings on the banister.
LORELAI: Yes we used to string them up in the traditional traditionally place of the fireplace, but there was that fire incident, and they nearly b*rned to bits. So now we put them on little nails on the banister.
RORY: Oh, we always go to Weston's for a cup of holiday candy-cane coffee, which is so delicious.
LORELAI: Delicious. And we bake cookies.
CHRISTOPHER: You bake?
RORY: Well we put on Christmas music, drink eggnog, and pretend to bake the cookies we bought from Weston's.
LORELAI: We do, however, make our own frosting. We use a handheld electric mixer from the dark ages so that Rory can continue the tradition of licking the b*at.
RORY: Yes, a k*ll which I have perfected over the years.
LORELAI: And then on Christmas eve, we leave the cookies out for Santa's reindeer.
RORY: Santa prefers gum.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I am very excited about these traditions, but you know because it's our first Christmas together as a family, I thought maybe it was time to start some new traditions.
LORELAI: Like what?
CHRISTOPHER: Well, for starters... I got us these. [holds up new stocking]
LORELAI: Wow.
RORY: Oh, they're so big and flashy.
CHRISTOPHER: Ha, I got one for each of us.
LORELAI: But we have stockings already.
RORY: [holding up the old stocking] I mean they're a little singed from the fire, but they're still usable.
CHRISTOPHER: But not stockings like these. Ha.
RORY: That's true.
CHRISTOPHER: Alright this will be a new tradition. I'm gonna hang them up.
You know what else we should do? We should go caroling.
LORELAI: No.
RORY: Are you kidding?
CHRISTOPHER: It'll be fun.
LORELAI: Well It wouldn't be fun for strangers to hear us sing.
RORY: It'd be cruel that's what it would be.
LORELAI: And embarrassing.
CHRISTOPHER: Guys, carols are beautiful. [singing badly, the girls look amused] Gl-o-o-o-o-o- o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oria in excelsis deo
DRAGONFLY INN – RECEPTION DESK
[Michel is on the phone as Luke enters]
MICHEL: yes, sir. Thank you. [seeing Luke] Oh. You. I thought we were done with you.
LUKE: Hi, Michel. Is Lorelai here? [on the phone] Hey. Can you tell Lorelai that... someone is here to see her? [hangs up, silence for a few second] Well, this is awfully awkward. We should make some sort of conversation. I see your sense of style has not changed.
LUKE: Nope.
MICHEL: I've often wondered, does someone in your family own a flannel company?
LUKE: Uh, no.
MICHEL: Oh. You know what? I cannot do this. Let us just stand here and let the awkwardness wash over us.
LUKE: Fine by me.
[a few seconds of silence before Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Hi.
MICHEL: Ahh, here she is. It's been a delight chatting with you.
LUKE: I'm sorry to just barge in like this.
LORELAI: That's okay.
LUKE: Can we talk somewhere?
LORELAI: Um, sure.
DRAGONFLY INN – LIBRARY
[Luke and Lorelai sitting on the same couch, face to face]
LUKE: [Sighs] Anna wants to move to New Mexico with April.
LORELAI: New Mexico?
LUKE: Anna's mother had major surgery, and she's not doing so well. And Anna wants to be near her, which I get. It's just I'd like to see April on some weekends and vacations.
LORELAI: Of course.
LUKE: But Anna says no. In fact, right now, she's not letting me see April at all, so I have to fight for custody, and I'm going to court.
LORELAI: Wow.
LUKE: Yeah, it's the whole thing. I got to get a lawyer and wear a tie. It's not fun.
LORELAI: It's good you're doing it, though.
LUKE: Well, I can't not. You know I can't not do it.
LORELAI: Right.
LUKE: So, anyway, um, the court date is coming up. And I need a character reference. And Liz wrote one, but my lawyer read it, and he said it was sweet, but it was filled with all these weird childhood anecdotes that I probably don't want to share with anyone, much less a court of law. And I need another one, and I just don't know who to go to. And I know it's an awful lot to ask. And if it's weird or whatever…
LORELAI: Yes…
[Luke continues talking like he didn't hear Lorelai]
LUKE: I mean, I totally understand.
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: But if you could, uh...
LORELAI: Yes, I'll do it.
LUKE: Yeah? Okay. All right, well, this is my lawyer's address, and you can just mail the letter directly to him.
LORELAI: Okay
LUKE: Yeah, and, look, if you don't mind, if you could do it as soon as possible... [Lorelai nods] the court date's right around the corner.
LORELAI: Definitely.
LUKE: Thanks. Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
LUKE: Yeah. Um, okay, well...I'll just... thanks.
LORELAI: Sure. I'll get right on it.
LUKE: I send it to here. Okay. [They shake hands, Lorelai looks a little weird about it] All right. Thanks. Okay.
DRAGONFLY INN – LIBRARY
[Later, Lorelai is on the couch and is trying to write the letter, with a note pad and pen but can't, she leaves]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Sookie is on the phone]
SOOKIE: No, that should do it. Thanks.
LORELAI: Ugh!
SOOKIE: It's hard, huh?
LORELAI: Yeah, the pressure is a lot, you know?
SOOKIE: Yeah, of course.
LORELAI: I mean I just keep thinking that whatever I write might help save Luke's relationship with his kid, which is huge and important, so the pressure's really getting to me -- that and a lack of sufficient caffeine.
SOOKIE: Of course. Totally. I mean plus I mean, it's Luke, and after all you've been through, it's got to be hard.
LORELAI: Well, yeah.
SOOKIE: You're having to dig up all those feelings for him. That can't be fun. You must be feeling overwhelmed.
LORELAI: I really don't think it's about digging up my feelings for Luke.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: I think it's really about writing an amazing letter. I mean the stakes are really high for him, and I want it to be something amazing and powerful, like Gettysburg address powerful or "I have a dream" powerful. So, I'm thinking I'll look a couple of those up online and just pop the name "Luke" in there and be I'll done with it.
SOOKIE: Sure. I don't think anyone will notice.
LORELAI: All right, back to work.
SOOKIE: Good luck.
DRAGONFLY INN – LIBRARY
[Lorelai enters with here coffee and gets to writing again but can't get started. Cuts to Lorelai returning to the couch with strawberries, she eats one, tries writing again. Then tried to juggle some strawberries. More writing and she rips out the sheet form the pad and screws it up. She plays the "bendy pen" trick with the pen before throwing it away]
LUKE'S DINER
[Lane is serving customers and VERY pregnant]
WOMAN CUSTOMER: Is it twins? It's got to be twins.
LANE: Is what twins?
MAN CUSTOMER: [pointing to Lanes belly] Are you...
LANE: Pregnant? You think I'm pregnant? Oh Yeah, it's not acceptable in this society to be a plus-sized woman who happens to carry her weight in her belly.
WOMAN CUSTOMER: So you're not -- oh, gee. Well, I need new glasses. I'm sorry.
LANE: Of course I'm pregnant. Turkey with Swiss. [Puts plates down hard. Moves on to other customers] Hey! Hey! What's up with this tip?
2ND WOMAN CUSTOMER: Oh, I'M...sorry.
LANE: This is 50%. I don't need your pity tips. Okay I'm pregnant, not homeless.
LUKE: April!
APRIL: [small laugh, they hug]
LUKE: Hey Wow. What are you doing?
APRIL: Well I biked over because… [sees Lane] oh, my gosh. Lane is gigantic.
LUKE: Yeah well I wouldn't mention that to Lane.
APRIL: Hey did you know the gestation period for an elephant is 22 months?
LUKE: Yeah will I wouldn't mention that to Lane, either. So what are you doing here, does your mother know you're here?
APRIL: She doesn't have a clue. See I told her I was gonna spend the whole day at the Boston museum of science with Melissa and her dad. And it's perfect because mom confirmed things with Melissa's dad two days ago. But then yesterday, I told Melissa's dad that I couldn't come because I had gotten the curse,
LUKE: The…
APRIL: Which is perfect, 'cause you know how awkward men get about menstruation.
LUKE: yeah ah look so it's really great to see you, but this isn't gonna work.
APRIL: But there's no way mom will ever figure it out. I even read all about cotton-topped Tamarin monkeys and the Van De Graaff generator, so I'll have plenty to tell her when I get back. Yeah I'm gonna have to take you home.
APRIL: No!
LUKE: I'm sorry.
APRIL: Dad, no. Please, no. I've missed you so much.
LUKE: Yeah well I missed you, too.
APRIL: I haven't seen you in ages and ages. Plus, if you take me home now, mom will know that I lied, and I'll get into so much trouble. Please?
LUKE: I don't know. I…
APRIL: Here. This is for you. Merry belated Christmas. Sorry it looks like this. I couldn't exactly wrap it in wrapping paper without arousing maternal suspicions, if you know what I mean.
LUKE: Thanks. I actually got you something, too.
APRIL: You did?
LUKE: Yeah. [small pause as the look at each other] So, are you hungry or what?
APRIL: Tuna-fish sandwiches?
LUKE: That's what I was thinking, too. [April giggles] Come on. Let's go upstairs.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
[Lorelai, Rory and Gigi are sitting at the table, Gigi wearing Rory's antlers, they are all dressed in Christmas design clothes. They are making cranberry and popcorn Garlands]
LORELAI: Be very careful with your needle.
GIGI: I know.
LORELAI: Okay because it's really, really pointy.
GIGI: I know.
RORY: Okay so, what guidelines did he give you?
LORELAI: None. No guidelines, no guidelines whatsoever. I'm supposed to write a character reference, so I thought I'd reference his character.
RORY: Sounds like you're on the right track.
LORELAI: No, I'm not because it turns out I can't write.
RORY: Oh, sure, you can.
LORELAI: No, I can't. I stare at the blank page, and I keep staring and staring. And eventually I have to get up and lubricate my eyeballs. Otherwise, they would fall out of my head, like raisins.
[Gigi giggles]
RORY: Well, are you using a pen? You can't just stare at the paper. You have to have a writing implement of some kind.
GIGI: [Showing what she's done] Look.
LORELAI: Very pretty, honey.
RORY: Hey what a good job.
LORELAI: You know what I really like? Your cranberry-to-popcorn ratio. Rory's more of a 1-to-1 kinda gal, but I'm like you. I like a lot of cranberry, little popcorn thrown in for flair. [just to Rory] Yours is pretty, too.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: I have a writing implement. The problem is that everything I write sounds so schmucky.
RORY: I'm sure that's not true. We're running low on cranberries.
LORELAI: "Luke Danes is a highly regarded member of this community." [Makes sick sound] "Not an ill word can be spoken of Mr. Danes." It's like I'm some documentary narrator from the history channel. And you know what phrase I keep using? "Stand-up." "Luke Danes is a stand-up guy. "He's an upstanding member of stars hollow, a real stand-up citizen." People are gonna think he's turned into a comedian.
RORY: Sounds like you're over thinking this. Maybe if you just put pen to paper.
LORELAI: I tried that, I thought, "I'll just sit down and write whatever comes -- no judgment, no inner critic." Boy was that a bad idea.
RORY: Really? Why?
LORELAI: Because my brain is a wild jungle full of scary gibberish. "I'm writing a letter. I can't write a letter. "Why can't I write a letter? I'm wearing a green dress. "I wish I was wearing my blue dress. "My blue dress is at the cleaners. "'The Germans wore gray. You wore blue. ''Casablanca'. "'Casablanca' is such a good movie. "'Casablanca.' The white house. Bush. "Why don't I drive a hybrid car? I should drive a hybrid car. "I should really take my bicycle to work. "Bicycle. Unicycle. Unitard. Hockey puck. Rattlesnake. Monkey, monkey, underpants."
[Gigi giggles again]
RORY: "Hockey puck, rattlesnake, monkey, monkey, underpants"?
LORELAI: Exactly, that's what I'm saying. It's a big bag of weird in there. So, I think I need inspiration. You know I need a muse. Perhaps I need "the muse." Maybe it would help if Sharon Stone would appear to me in an alarming caftan and coo inspirational words in my ear.
RORY: Just write what you feel. That's all writing is. Hey do you think there might be some reason why you're having trouble? I mean I would imagine that writing about Luke wouldn't be easy.
LORELAI: I know -- you should write it.
RORY: What? No.
LORELAI: Yes. You are a wonderful writer. Everything you write is so good. Your grocery lists are like shimmering haikus.
RORY: You write a pretty mean grocery list yourself. And it doesn't have to shimmer it just has to be authentic and real. Oh! You know what I'm gonna do?
LORELAI: Write my thing for me.
RORY: No, I'm going to write a letter to Lucy explaining how sorry I am. That way, she doesn't have to see me, and she can just read it and she'll still know.
LORELAI: That's great and after you do that, you can write my letter for me.
RORY: No, this is something you have to write yourself.
GIGI: What letter?
LORELAI: Uh...to Santa.
GIGI: Wow.
LORELAI: You know I bet my problem is? The whole writing-by-hand thing. You know I think what would help is if I got my old electric typewriter out. The soothing sound of that irritating buzzing -- that's what would help me.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm home!
LORELAI: [changing the subject, Rory notices] So, cranberries really stay on the string, and popcorn falls right off. Hi, sweetie.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, everybody.
RORY: Hey, dad.
GIGI: Hi dad.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey. [Chris and Lorelai kiss] Wow. Look at those.
GIGI: They're for the trees.
LORELAI: So what do you have in the bag?
CHRISTOPHER: No snooping. This is Santa's secret stuff.
GIGI: Lorelai knows Santa.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yeah?
GIGI: She does Santa's dry cleaning.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, Lorelai is a remarkable woman.
[Lorelai chuckles]
STARS HOLLOW – OUTSIDE LUKE'S DINNER
[Lane exits and walks (waddles) down the street]
LANE: [to some people on the street] Uh-huh.
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT – EXTERIOR
[Lane is coming home and enters the apartment, Lane is in a bad mood.]
ZACH: The yellow squash?
MRS KIM: Yes, they're a delicacy. We're going to steam them along with the broccoli.
ZACH: Is that adult broccoli? Can you do that with baby squash?
MRS KIM: Yes, it's very high in oxidants.
[at the same time]
ZACH: Welcome home, babe.
MRS KIM: Welcome home, Lane.
ZACH: So we went to the nature mart, and guess what we got you. Turnip greens – turns out they got a sick amount of folic acid. What else did we get? Squash, zucchini, tofu.
MRS KIM: Special calcium-fortified tofu.
ZACH: And the calcium's real important because you're not eating some of your previous calcium sources, like soft cheese. You're not eating soft cheese, are you?
LANE: No, no. I'm not having any soft cheese.
ZACH: And no sushi?
MRS KIM: And no duck. We don't want the babies to have webbed feet.
LANE: So the duck sushi I had for lunch was probably a mistake, huh? [they look shocked] I'm kidding, mama. I am b*at. Today at work, it was absolutely ridiculous. [sits on the couch, Zach joins her] Every other customer was "baby" -- I'm gonna tell Luke tomorrow I quit...
ZACH: You should put your feet up.
LANE: I'm fine.
ZACH: How are your ankles?
LANE: They're fine.
ZACH: Oh you know what I was reading about? Compression pantyhose. A lot of pregnant women wear them to help with circulation.
MRS KIM: How's your bladder, are the babies putting pressure on your bladder?
LANE: What I don't know.
ZACH: Well how many times did you urinate today?
LANE: Oh, my god, Zach! I am so not answering that question!
MRS KIM: Here are some new prenatal vitamins we bought you. I'm going to put them on your bedside table.
LANE: Fine.
MRS KIM: You have to take two every morning the moment you wake up.
LANE: Fine!
MRS KIM: Maybe I need to make you a chart.
LANE: I don't need a chart.
MRS KIM: I happen to know that you forgot to take your calcium tablets for two mornings. That is not right, Lane.
LANE: Mama, you're counting my pills?
MRS KIM: Yes, of course.
LANE: [Sighs, then when Mrs Kim has left the room she sneaks out a candy bar from the pillow on the couch and opens it.]
ZACH: I'm serious about the whole compression-pantyhose thing. I could totally pick you up a pair. I mean do I relish the prospect of being seen skulking around the pantyhose aisle? No. But I'm sure you don't want varicose veins.
LANE: I don't want pantyhose!
ZACH: Oh. Okay.
[hearing her mother come Lane hides the candy bar]
MRS KIM: I have decided I will make a chart. I need a piece of paper, a ruler, and some magic markers.
LANE: I'm serious, mama. I don't need… what is that?
ZACH: Oh, it's the crib we ordered. Isn't it cool. It'll be big enough for both of them.
LANE: Where are my drums?
ZACH: They're good they're safe. We put them in the closet.
LANE: The closet? You put my drum kit in the closet?
ZACH: Yeah, we needed the space, and, Lane, we haven't had band practice for months.
LANE: [waddles over and opens the closet, shouting] We need to have band practice!
ZACH: Sure. And we will.
LANE: Now.
ZACH: Well if you want, we can call Gil and Brian, but I mean can you even play?
LANE: What do you mean, can I play?
ZACH: I mean, in your condition.
LANE: [getting angrier] I can play.
ZACH: Okay. Cool.



WESTON'S
[Rory and Lorelai are sitting at a table]
LORELAI: I melted three entire candy canes into this not-very-large cup of coffee, and still I can barely taste it.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: It's just the vaguest whisper of peppermint.
RORY: Peppermint. [makes hand gesture]
LORELAI: I swear I could get the same effect if I put Vaporub on my chest and drank coffee at the same time.
RORY: Peppermint. [makes hand gesture again]
LORELAI: I mean how arbitrary is it to decide to stop serving candy-cane coffee the day after Christmas? Christmas spirit is not something that can be turned off like a faucet on December 26th.
RORY: Yeah, it stinks.
LORELAI: On the plus side, any chest congestion I had is now totally cleared up.
RORY: So that's good.
LORELAI: Well, let's go Christmas-shopping.
RORY: Write your letter.
LORELAI: I can't. I need a treat.
RORY: This was your treat, coming to Weston's was supposed to buck up your spirits and inspire your writing.
LORELAI: No, candy-cane coffee was supposed to be my treat. This coffee is no treat. Let's face it -- this is un-candy-cane-coffee coffee, and it's totally un-bucking up my spirits. So it's decided -- let's go shopping.
RORY: Write.
LORELAI: Rory, I can't. Ooh. I have an idea. Excuse me. Hi. Merry Christmas.
SUE: Christmas is over.
LORELAI: Okay. Sue -- pretty name. I have a hunch that there's some of the secret candy-cane-coffee mix just sitting in the back there, and I wonder if I could make it worth your while if you and I could come to some sort of arrangement.
SUE: Like I said before we stop selling candy-cane coffee when Christmas is over.
LORELAI: Right I'm not talking about selling it. I'm talking about maybe if you misplaced a canister or two.
SUE: Misplaced?
LORELAI: Misplaced. [winks at her]
SUE: Honey.
LORELAI: Yes?
SUE: Christmas is over.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: Are we gonna talk about this?
LORELAI: About what?
RORY: Why are you lying to dad?
LORELAI: I'm not lying.
RORY: He walked into the kitchen earlier, and you started prattling on about popcorn and cranberries.
LORELAI: I wasn't prattling. Come on, let's blow this popsicle stand. [Sighs]
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
[They girls are walking down the street]
RORY: But you're not telling him about this character-reference thing are you.
LORELAI: Well I haven't yet.
RORY: And you're not planning to.
LORELAI: Well
RORY: You're intentionally not telling him. That's kind of a lie of omission.
LORELAI: A lie of omission Isn't that an Ashley Judd/Morgan Freeman movie?
RORY: Look mum if there's anything to be learned from this whole thing with Lucy, it's that honesty is the best policy.
LORELAI: Err, It's an okay policy.
RORY: But how do you expect to have any kind of relationship if you're not honest with him?
LORELAI: Honey look, I have been around a long time, okay? I wore leggings the last time they were trendy. I knew Tom Hanks when he was a Bosom Buddy. I have lived, and I have learned.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: And I understand that you value honesty, and I applaud that value. But sometimes the truth is a little more complicated.
RORY: More complicated how?
LORELAI: More complicated. Look we don't have to talk about this.
RORY: I know but I want you to tell me what's going on.
LORELAI: Things with dad are great. They're better than great. It's just that...
RORY: What?
LORELAI: He's been a bit on edge about Luke. You know I ran into Luke outside Doose's the other day, and dad saw me holding Liz's baby. And it just wasn't great. It wasn't great timing.
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: And this whole mom having the not-a-wedding-party thing caused tension, and we argued. So I just want to be sensitive and not worry him about something he doesn't need to worry about.
RORY: Well, that makes sense.
LORELAI: But everything is gonna be fine. Better than fine -- it's gonna be great.
RORY: Okay. Well, you know, mom, I've been around for a while, too. I remember tom hanks from his "Joe Versus The Volcano" days.
LORELAI: Yeah, you were like 5.
RORY: Yeah but the point is, I'm not a kid anymore you know. You don't have to create this whole Christmas illusion where everything in the world is magical and fine. It's okay if it's not.
LORELAI: You still believe in Santa, though, right?
RORY: Your best dry-cleaning client? Of course.
LUKE'S DINER – THE APARTMENT
[Luke is adjusting the gift April gave him]
APRIL: A little to the right. Okay. Too far. A little to the left, there.
LUKE: How's that?
APRIL: Good. It really livens up your apartment.
LUKE: It's a very lively mask. Thanks again, April. I love it. I really do.
APRIL: It's based on my real face you know.
LUKE: Oh, yeah?
APRIL: Oh I mean not the outside, but the inside. I made it in art class, and I had to lie still with straws up my nose while a partner put plaster strips on my face.
LUKE: Straws up your nose.
APRIL: I suffer for my art. Anyway, this kid Evan, he got Liz Alderman as a partner, who's a total wild child. And she laid the plaster strips all willy-nilly and ended up pulling off half his eyebrows.
LUKE: Oh, that's not good huh.
APRIL: Actually, Liz Alderman's on my swim team now.
LUKE: Oh yeah.
APRIL: She's got these really huge feet, which coach Bennett finds promising.
LUKE: Like built-in flippers.
APRIL: Exactly, hopefully they kick in -- no pun intended -- before our big swim meet in may.
LUKE: May huh.
APRIL: May 15th. 10 different clubs are sending teams. It's gonna be amazing.
LUKE: You know I hear they have really great swim teams in New Mexico.
APRIL: Yeah, right. New Mexico is a barren, dusty desert, and they probably don't even have water to swim in.
LUKE: You know what in hot climates, they actually have more swimming pools. I bet you a lot of kids there will be really into swimming.
APRIL: Well then they're probably too good for me. I mean the only reason I get to do so many events is 'cause everyone on my team stinks worse than I do.
LUKE: April.
APRIL: It's true.
LUKE: Go on. [putting a large present on the table] All right, go ahead and open up your Christmas present.
APRIL: Are you trying to bribe me out of a bad mood with the offer of material goods? 'Cause I'm amenable to that.
[Luke smiling and small laugh]
APRIL: [Gasps] Wow! A rock polisher! Thanks so much.
LUKE: You like it?
APRIL: It's the perfect present.
LUKE: Well you hinted at it pretty hard, so I figured it might be the right thing.
APRIL: It is. It is. But, dad, I kind already got a rock polisher from grandma.
LUKE: Oh. Well, then it's not the perfect present.
APRIL: No, it is. It is. This one looks more powerful than the one I already have. Plus, I mean who couldn't use two rock polishers?
LUKE: Yeah?
APRIL: Sure. You should see my rock collection right now. It's insane, I've practically got a quarry in my bedroom -- granite, of course, but also feldspar, quartz, mica, limestone.
LUKE: Cool.
APRIL: I know. I've been biking over to Beacon Falls and going rock-hunting around Naugatuck river. It amazing the other day I found an arrowhead in almost perfect condition. It's so sharp, I think I'd get in trouble if I brought it to school.
LUKE: You know, if you're interested in arrowheads, New Mexico has some incredible places…
APRIL: Dad.
LUKE: Okay. Okay. Let's open this thing.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LORELAI'S BED ROOM
[Lorelai is lying on the bed trying to write the letter]
CHRISTOPHER: Hey! I'm done with the lights. Do you want to see them now, or do you want to wait till after dark?
[Lorelai quickly hides the note pad]
LORELAI: Uh, I will wait -- to get the full effect.
CHRISTOPHER: What you got there?
LORELAI: Uh, nothing. Just some of Santa's secret stuff.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, yeah? What did you get me?
LORELAI: A Maserati.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh that's so sweet of you it's amazing how a Maserati can fit behind the bed like that.
LORELAI: Well I haven't put it together yet, which reminds me -- do you have any masking tape?
CHRISTOPHER: You're gonna assemble the Maserati with masking tape?
LORELAI: Don't ask questions! Just get out of here it's Santa's workshop!
CHRISTOPHER: All right!
[Lorelai gets the note pad]
LORELAI: Rory! We have to go shopping, get your dad a Maserati! [Exits room]
LANE, ZACH AND BRIAN'S APARTMENT
[Lane, Zach and Brian (who can't stop looking at Lanes belly]
LANE: So of course I spun the record for a week straight, because who wouldn't want to listen to Art Brut for a week straight? Oh Pass me your lyrics.
BRIAN: Yeah. Here they are.
LANE: As far as I'm concerned, "Formed a Band" could be the new national anthem. I swear I could literally stand and cover my heart if asked. Brian? Brian? [Lane hits a cymbal]
ZACH: Whoa! What's going on here, babe? Everything okay? You got to watch the loud noises.
LANE: Loud noises? We're about to play rock music, Zach.
BRIAN: Oh, check out the mandolin.
ZACH: Yeah, right. She's a beaut, huh?
BRIAN: Yeah cool. So what kind of stuff you been working on?
ZACH: Mostly I've just been messing around. I wrote one song that was kind of White Stripes' "Little Ghost" meets the Decemberists meets Gulag Orkestar meets, like, "Losing my Religion" meets Jethro Burns on that Steve Goodman album meets "Battle of Evermore" meets The Smiths meets... some other stuff.
BRIAN: That's a lot of meeting.
ZACH: Exactly. Whoa. Okay, this is eerie. You see the way I'm holding my mandolin. It's exactly one of the baby holds I've learned. See how I have it in the crook of my arm with its head supported?
BRIAN: That's how you're supposed to hold a baby?
ZACH: One of the ways. Lane, I wish your mom was here. This is so "rock-a-bye, baby."
LANE: [A little sarcastically] Fascinating.
BRIAN: So wait there are different ways to officially hold a baby?
ZACH: Yeah, sure -- you got your "hello, world," where you put the baby's back to your stomach and put your hand under here for support.
BRIAN: Hmm
ZACH: You got your belly hold, where you put the baby's chest down along one of your forearms. This is really great for gassy babies. Then you got your fruit basket, which is…
[Knock on door]
LANE: Finally. [Laughs while she goes and opens the door.]
GIL: Hey, hey, hey! How we doing? Long time no see.
BRIAN: Gil, how's it hangin'?
GIL: It's hangin' great, my friend. So, check it out. This is the youngest of my brood -- Macon. Macon, this is the band.
MACON: [does the peace sign] What up?
GIL: The sitter flaked, and I got Macon the bacon under my wing.
ZACH: That's cool.
GIL: Sorry for the short notice, but I figured you guys would be a little more understanding being that you're in the family way. Speaking of which... whoa! Check you out, Lane. You are some kind of serious fertility goddess.
LANE: Thanks.
GIL: Zach, nice work, man.
[They high 5]
LANE: I thought we should warm up by practicing some of our old songs. Then maybe Zach could show us what he's been doing with the mandolin.
GIL: The mandolin.
[Zach plays the mandolin]
GIL: Na-na-na-na-na-na-na right on. Oh, man! You got the alcmere 3000!
LANE: The what?
GIL: The breast pump. I'm psyched you guys picked this one. It's really gentle. I mean my wife's got sensitive nipples. This one didn't bum her out at all.
[Lane is not impressed]
BRIAN: You use that to pump...
GIL: Milk. Sure. That's if you choose to go the breast-feeding route.
LANE: You guys, I'm sure Brian is not interested in this.
BRIAN: Breast-feeding, huh?
GIL: Yeah I mean, some people go with the formula deal, which is cool, too. Actually, for baby number two, we did use formula.
ZACH: Yeah.
GIL: I mean, if you use formula, the old lady can smoke, drink, eat as many tacos as she wants -- no problemo.
ZACH: You hear that, babe?
LANE: Yeah. Tacos. Thrilling.
MALL
[Lorelai and Rory are shopping]
RORY: Why can't they make books out of something lighter?
LORELAI: Lighter than paper?
RORY: I'm being punished for being generous.
LORELAI: That's what you get for having so many smart friends. So I think we're doing well.
RORY: Yeah I think we're done. Oh wait Babette do we have something for Babette?
LORELAI: The needlepoint pillow with the sassy saying.
RORY: Oh yeah, you know It's kind of impressive when people curse in needlepoint. There's something laborious about it.
LORELAI: And I got cologne for Michel and the same cologne for my mother.
RORY: Weird.
LORELAI: Well, they'll both hate whatever I give them, so I figured, why spend time picking out doomed gifts? Then I have whatever Williams-Sonoma sold me for Sookie -- a butter slicer, a bread warmer/wine maker.
RORY: Well, I'm sure she'll love her butter slicer.
LORELAI: If that's even what it is. I swear they could attach a stone to a piece of string and call it a poultry pounder, and I'd shell out 35 bucks.
RORY: So I guess all we need is dad.
LORELAI: Yeah I really want to get him something great. We have the sweater.
RORY: And the really heavy book.
LORELAI: But I want to get him something that he'll really love.
RORY: Well, we will. I mean we'll find something. We have a whole mall here full of post-Christmas prices. Well find something.
LORELAI: Guys are tricky, but your dad's really tricky. I mean what does he need? What does he want?
RORY: Hmm, perhaps a poultry pounder.
LORELAI: Plus, he is my husband now. I've never bought something for a husband. I wish they had a special store for husband stuff.
RORY: Hey! [pointing to a telescope]
LORELAI: Huh.
RORY: What do you think?
LORELAI: Maybe.
RORY: I think he'd love it. Come on. [they enter the store] Oh, look at this one.
LORELAI: Oh! [looks through the eye piece] Doesn't work so good inside, though.
RORY: Well.
LORELAI: Solar systems, 50% off!
RORY: Oh that's not just a post-Christmas sale. That's a post-Pluto sale.
LORELAI: Poor Pluto.
RORY: Oh, poor Pluto. [spotting Luke] Hey, um, it's Luke.
LORELAI: Hmm? [Lorelai looks up to see Luke, he nods and she waves] Hi. I guess we should...
RORY: Yeah.
[They walk over]
APRIL: Oh! Hey!
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey. Hey, Rory.
RORY: Hey, Luke. Hey, April.
APRIL: Hey. Hey.
LORELAI: Hi. Hi, April.
APRIL: Hi.
LORELAI: So.
LUKE: Yeah April showed up at the diner today out of the blue.
APRIL: You make it sound like Pearl Harbor or something.
LUKE: No, I mean, it was a surprise -- a nice surprise. So, how's it going?
LORELAI: It's -- I'm almost done.
LUKE: [looking serious] Done?
LORELAI: You're not talking about the letter. You're just asking in general.
LUKE: I meant, how's it going?
LORELAI: Good. I'm good. We're good.
APRIL: Hey, I like your sweaters. They're very festive.
RORY: Thank you. It's Christmas for us.
LORELAI: Rory was in London at the end of December, so we waited to do Christmas together.
LUKE: Of course you did.
CASHIER: Sir, do you have a return?
LUKE: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
RORY: So, April, how was your Christmas?
APRIL: Well, I'm 60% atheist and 40% agnostic, so Christmas isn't really a big deal for me.
RORY: Oh, really? 60/40, huh?
LORELAI: More of a winter solstice gal?
APRIL: Exactly. You went to London by yourself over Christmas?
RORY: Oh I wasn't exactly by myself. I met my boyfriend there.
APRIL: Oh. Meeting a lover in a foreign city -- how glamorous. I can't wait to be grown up and glamorous and make my own decisions about where I go and when. Being a kid is the pits sometimes.
LORELAI: It sure is.
APRIL: Oh, thanks.
LORELAI: What'd you get?
APRIL: Well, my dad got me the greatest present ever -- a rock-polishing kit -- but I had already gotten it from my grandma, who's very into Christmas. So we exchanged it for this microscope, which is also the greatest present.
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: Wow. That's great.
APRIL: My dad's always been a great gift giver.
LUKE: I guess I don't know if I was always considered good at picking out presents, right, Rory?
RORY: Oh, no, you've always been great.
LUKE: Towels?
APRIL: What towels?
RORY: You meant well.
APRIL: You gave her towels?
RORY: For my birthday.
LUKE: I had them monogrammed. I thought it was cool.
RORY: Yes you went through quite the monogramming phase.
LUKE: I believe you received monogrammed pencils, a monogrammed mug, a monogrammed backpack, and a monogrammed belt.
RORY: Well no one ever tried to steal that belt. Those were my favorite towels. I still have the washcloth.
APRIL: That's hilarious.
RORY: Hey remember the year you got me the unicorn marionette with the purple horn?
LUKE: You didn't like the unicorn marionette?
RORY: I've never really been that into unicorns.
LUKE: I thought you loved that.
RORY: I know because I was being polite.
APRIL: Being polite can be dangerous.
RORY: Yes, it totally backfired, because for the next five years, I only got unicorn items -- unicorn sweatshirt, unicorn pencil case, bumper sticker -- "I brake for unicorns." No but you were always so nice. You never forgot my birthday. And every holiday, there was a monogrammed unicorn item.
APRIL: Dad for the record I'm not really into unicorns, either.
LUKE: Well, I'm glad to know it. Anyway we should get going. I got to get you home, kiddo.
LORELAI: Well, we have to buy up all the Pluto stuff. It's really gonna be a collector's item.
LUKE: Sure.
APRIL: Bye, you guys.
LORELAI: Bye.
RORY: Have a merry Christmas.
LORELAI: Merry Christmas.
STARS HOLLOW – OUTSIDE DOOSES MARKET
[Lane and Zach exit]
ZACH: Honey, let me carry that.
LANE: No, thank you.
ZACH: Lane come on.
LANE: I'm perfectly capable of carrying a bag of groceries.
ZACH: Nutter butters? I put those Nutter butters back on the shelf.
LANE: Well I took them off of the shelf.
ZACH: You know your mom doesn't think you should be eating too many cookies.
LANE: Enough about my mom, okay? I'm so sick of her.
ZACH: Come on she's been pretty great, Lane. She cooks for us, she cleans for us. She's a total fount of baby information.
LANE: Well you know what maybe you should have married my mom, then, okay?
ZACH: Well, I'm sure when your mom was younger... [Lane looks at Zach] hey, I'm just saying, she's a handsome woman. What I'm just saying that I bet when she was younger, she used to look a little like you -- shorter hair, no glasses, maybe a bit more crabby maybe.
LANE: Well, I'm sick of her.
ZACH: That's kind of harsh.
LANE: I am. I'm sick of her. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of being treated like I'm not a person, like I'm some incubator whose puffy ankles and varicose veins and bathroom habits are up for discussion. On what planet is it appropriate to ask a person how many times a day she urinates?
ZACH: Well you can ask me.
LANE: I don't want to ask you.
ZACH: Six times today so far. I had a lot of coffee.
LANE: I'm sick of being told what to eat and what I shouldn't and what side I should sleep on. I'm a person, Zach. I'm an adult. I don't want to be hiding things under the floorboards and behind cushions again.
ZACH: Yeah that's no good. Plus, we're starting to get ants and mites.
LANE: I don't want everything to change just because we're having these babies.
ZACH: But things are going to change. There's no getting around it. Really, really soon, we're gonna have two babies -- two alive human sons.
LANE: It was such a small window -- a peephole, really. For years, I was this repressed kid, and then there was the briefest of windows. And then -- slam. All of a sudden, I'm this overburdened mother. I barely got to do it, Zach. I barely got the chance to be a person.
ZACH: No, no you can still be a person and you can still be rock 'n' roll. Having babies doesn't mean you can't be rock 'n' roll.
LANE: I don't know.
ZACH: Give me a break, Sonic Youth has a kid, and they're still way cool.
LANE: Yeah.
ZACH: And Mick Jagger -- that cat has like 15 kids, and he still goes out and rocks.
LANE: Yeah, I guess.
ZACH: For sure the man rocks hard, and then he comes home and makes another kid.
LANE: I don't want to make any other kids ever.
ZACH: All I'm saying is, we can still go out and play. I mean that's one of the cool things about having your mother around -- built-in babysitter.
LANE: Yeah. I just don't think I can bear having her around all the time.
ZACH: What about weekends, what if she hung out with us on the weekends and spent the week back at her pad?
LANE: Yeah, I guess that'd be all right.
ZACH: Let me carry that bag for you.
LUKE'S DINER – EXTERIOR
[Luke and April arrive back from the mall]
LUKE: I had such a good time with you today.
APRIL: I was thinking that Tuesdays after school, I could tell mom that I have chess club. And I really only have chess club once a week, but I could pretend it's twice a week. As soon as school's over, I could bike halfway to stars hollow, and you could meet me. I could hide in the bushes and do prearranged bird calls, like a mourning dove or something -- a "coo-roo coo-roo coo-roo" as a signal.
LUKE: Yeah, I don't think so.
APRIL: Or I don't need to do the bird calls.
LUKE: It wouldn't be right, April. It wouldn't we can't lie to your mother.
APRIL: But.
LUKE: Your mother and I are not totally seeing eye to eye on certain things, and so we're sort of in negotiations to figure out how to share our parenting responsibilities.
APRIL: Do you have a good lawyer?
LUKE: A good…
APRIL: You better have a good one, 'cause mom hired a shark.
LUKE: We're gonna figure that out. Don't worry about it, okay? But the court case is the reason that it's really important that we do everything honestly and aboveboard.
APRIL: Yeah. I guess that makes sense.
LUKE: Okay. So...what should we do with the microscope?
APRIL: Keep it. I'll use it the next time I'm over -- soon.
LUKE: Okay.
APRIL: You can set it up if you want. Just make sure that you always remove the slide before you rotate the lenses, or you can grind things up. And always carry it with a hand under the base.
LUKE: I'll be very careful.
[They hug]
APRIL: Bye.
LUKE: Bye. Don't forget to put your helmet on.

MANSION – FRONT ENTRANCE – INTERIOR
[Lorelai, Rory, Richard, Emily and Chris approach the front door.]
RICHARD: So the hunter comes out of the tent, looks around, and says, "ah, very well then. Now, where's that gorilla?"
[Laughter]
LORELAI: Well now you've heard dad's big game-hunter- and-the-gorilla joke. You're officially part of the family.
RORY: It's not too late to back out.
EMILY: Yes, Richard, I beg you -- get some new material.
CHRISTOPHER: I actually like the joke, and the family is not bad, either. Thanks for a great meal, Emily.
RORY: Yes thank you, grandma.
EMILY: You're quite welcome. Did you really like the meal?
LORELAI: It was incredible, mom.
EMILY: On our recent trip to Mexico, your father and I were served Quail Mazatl*n, and I insisted that Bridget find the recipe.
LORELAI: Well, she found it.
RORY: Yeah tell that Bridget that that Quail Mazatl*n was a triumph.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm
EMILY: It's the tequila-cactus sauce that makes it special.
LORELAI: So special.
CHRISTOPHER: Really just great.
RICHARD: Well, young lady, I'll see you around the campus.
RORY: Yes, you will.
EMILY: Oh and Lorelai, it turns out that I have an emergency D.A.R. Board meeting on Tuesday, so I won't be able to get together to finalize the seating chart for the party.
LORELAI: No seating-chart get-together? How will I live?
CHRISTOPHER: I'll help you get through it.
RICHARD: Christopher, are you sure you can't stay for a cigar? Cuban. Montecristo. Perfect complement to a tequila-cactus sauce.
LORELAI: Dad, we really have to get going.
CHRISTOPHER: She's right, but maybe I could get a Montecristo to go.
RICHARD: Oh, nice try, nice try.
CHRISTOPHER: I thought I'd give it a sh*t.
EMILY: Another time for cigars. I'll see you, Rory.
RORY: Bye, grandma.
LORELAI: Bye, mom.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye, bye.
RICHARD: See you in class, Rory.
RORY: See you!
MANSION – EXTERIOR
LORELAI: Oh, my god!
CHRISTOPHER: I thought for sure your mom saw me put mine in here.
LORELAI: How could so tiny a quail have such a big, awful taste?
RORY: I think the sauce b*rned through my napkin.
CHRISTOPHER: And now we just throw it in the bushes?
LORELAI: No, no, no…
RORY: No!
LORELAI: We tried that before.
RORY: The chicken Kiev. The Baklava, too.
LORELAI: Yeah the neighbor's cat found it and dragged it to the back patio.
RORY: So busted.
CHRISTOPHER: Alright so how do we get rid of it?
LORELAI: We take it with us in the car.
RORY: Then we give it the old heave-ho over Tyler's bridge.
LORELAI: Got to make sure we get every piece in the water, though.
RORY: Oh yeah one stray piece of Quail Mazatl*n, and grandma will have the river dragged.
LORELAI: We need something to weigh them down. How attached are you to that watch?
[They get into the car to leave]
OPENING CREDITS
LORELAI'S HOUSE – KITCHEN
[Lorelai is starting to make coffee when she hears knocking on the front door]
SOOKIE: Morning!
LORELAI: Uhh.
SOOKIE: Ow! What was that for?
LORELAI: Thought maybe I was dreaming.
SOOKIE: Then you're supposed to ask me to pinch you. You're not suppose to pinch me.
LORELAI: Well I'm confused. I haven't even had my coffee yet. I have your coffee and muffins hot from the oven.
LORELAI: Okay.
SOOKIE: Well, actually, they're not really muffins. They're muffin tops because the muffin tops are the only parts you like.
LORELAI: You baked me a whole basket of muffin tops?
SOOKIE: Yep. I have got apple-cinnamon-walnut, lemon-poppy seed, apple spice, and double chocolate chip, which is really more cake than muffin. [gets some plates] But if calling them a muffin means you can eat them in the morning, then I am all for it. So, which would you like?
LORELAI: Um, the cake one, please.
SOOKIE: Ooh, good choice. [placing the plate on the table] Ta-da.
LORELAI: Sookie?
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm?
LORELAI: What are you doing here? It's not even 7:00.
SOOKIE: What?! Why can't a girl get up superearly on her day off, make some muffin tops, and bring a hot cup of coffee over to the best friend and business partner a girl could ever have?
LORELAI: I guess.
SOOKIE: I mean, I had to get up early anyway. Jackson and I are going skiing. We're so excited. We haven't done that since before the kids.
LORELAI: [Taking a drink of coffee] Hmm. That's cool.
SOOKIE: Yeah, Jackson loves to ski, and I love to dress up in those cozy clothes, the furry boots, and curl up with a Sue Grafton mystery. I got "'R' is for 'Ricochet'" and "'S' is for 'Silence.'" If the ski conditions are good, I can get a good eight hours of Kinsey Millhone in. Yeah, we were so excited.
LORELAI: "Were"?
SOOKIE: Our, uh, babysitter called last night, and she's got mono.
LORELAI: Ahh.
SOOKIE: Yeah. How is that, uh, muffin top?
LORELAI: It has the faintest aftertaste of bribe.
SOOKIE: I know it's a lot of work to take care of the kids, and I know that it's your day off, too, but I would really, really appreciate it, and I would really, really, really owe you big.
LORELAI: I'd love to take care of Davey and Martha.
SOOKIE: Oh, did I happen to mention that you're the best friend and business partner a girl could ever have?
LORELAI: I believe you led with that.
SOOKIE: Oh, good, because you are. Thank you.
LORELAI: No problem. God, this coffee is good.
SOOKIE: Well, yeah, it should be. I… got it from Luke's. Sorry. Is that weird?
LORELAI: Oh, no, that's not weird.
SOOKIE: Good.
LORELAI: I mean, it shouldn't be weird.
SOOKIE: No, it shouldn't be weird.
LORELAI: It would be weird if I intentionally didn't drink the coffee. You know that would be weird.
SOOKIE: Yeah, that would be weird.
LORELAI: I mean, it's good coffee.
SOOKIE: Yeah, and there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy good coffee.
LORELAI: Exactly.
SOOKIE: Good.
LORELAI: Yeah, so it's not weird. What did you do with the muffin bottoms?
SOOKIE: I made a muffin-bottom pie. It's actually pretty good. I'm thinking about patenting it.
LORELAI: Mmm, muffin-bottom pie -- sounds dirty.
CHRISTOPHER: Mm-mmm! There are baked goods in here. At first I thought I was dreaming.
SOOKIE: Please don't pinch me.
CHRISTOPHER: When I realized I wasn't, I thought, "somebody must've broke in here and started baking."
LORELAI: Baking and entering -- a crime wave sweeping the nation.
CHRISTOPHER: Just not used to that smell.
LORELAI: Well, enjoy. Sookie brought us coffee and freshly baked muffin tops.
CHRISTOPHER: Muffin tops?
SOOKIE: They are the best part.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay.
LORELAI: You got to be careful, though, because they induce a sugar coma where it makes you say, "yes, yes, anything, yes."
SOOKIE: I needed her to babysit today.
CHRISTOPHER: You need anything from me?
SOOKIE: Nope.
CHRISTOPHER: Then we're good to go. Actually, this is gonna work out well. Ship the daughter unit off to her grandmother, get rid of the wife unit. leaving the husband unit free to do some good, old-fashioned manual labor.
LORELAI: He's putting up a flat-screen.
SOOKIE: Oh, flat-screen what?
CHRISTOPHER: Come on. Are you serious?
LORELAI: TV.
SOOKIE: Oh.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: You'll see. You're gonna love it.
SOOKIE: Well, I should get going. I have to get ready for skiing. Oh, hey, do you have any magazines in case I get through both "R" and "S"?
LORELAI: Yeah, on the hall table.
SOOKIE: Okay, great. I'll get them on the way out. [Sighs] Thank you, Lorelai. [Sookie hugs Lorelai] I really, really appreciate it.
LORELAI: It's okay.
SOOKIE: [They hug again, Lorelai is feeling a little weird and looks at Chris] No, I mean, it takes a special person to, you know, on her day off.
LORELAI: No problem.
SOOKIE: Okay. Look what you're making me do. Okay. Bye. [Hugs Chris]
CHRISTOPHER: Okay. [Chuckles]
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: Bye.
SOOKIE: Bye.
CHRISTOPHER: Bye, Sookie. [Laughing] What was that?
LORELAI: I don't know. She's really excited about her skiing/reading trip. [Sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: This is good coffee.
LORELAI: It is good. It's from Luke's.
[awkward moments]
CHRISTOPHER: Oh.
LORELAI: Is that okay?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. [pushes the cup away]
LORELAI: Sookie brought it. Are you sure?
CHRISTOPHER: Of course. Why wouldn't it be?
LORELAI: Because.
CHRISTOPHER: It's fine.
LORELAI: Okay.
CHRISTOPHER: So, what do you do with the muffin bottoms?
LORELAI: Oh, she turned them into a pie, you know? She's like an Indian. They use all the parts of the buffalo.
CHRISTOPHER: I don't fully understand that woman.
LORELAI: She bakes good stuff.
CHRISTOPHER: That I get.
LORELAI: Hmm.
YALE
[Students are returning to school after the holidays, Rory pins her letter to the notice board on Lucy and Olivia's door and leaves.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Chris is unpacking the Plasma TV]
LORELAI: Oh, my god, the eagle has landed.
CHRISTOPHER: Yep, they delivered it while you were in the shower.
LORELAI: Did they deliver it or throw it?
CHRISTOPHER: Comes with a lot of equipment. Isn't it beautiful?
LORELAI: Yeah. And big.
CHRISTOPHER: All the better to watch Reggie Bush score touchdowns on.
LORELAI: I forget. Which one of the bush daughters is Reggie?
CHRISTOPHER: Ah you're gonna love it. Hey, have you seen the level?
LORELAI: The thing with the green bubble that goes back and forth?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
LORELAI: Yeah, Paul Anka and I were playing with it.
CHRISTOPHER: You were playing with it with the dog?
LORELAI: Yes I was trying to hypnotize him with the bubble.
CHRISTOPHER: Ah-ha
LORELAI: See if I could talk him out of the habit of chewing on the corner of the welcome mat, or I was gonna give him a wacky posthypnotic suggestion, like the doorbell rings, and he spins around in circles.
CHRISTOPHER: Were you able to hypnotize him?
LORELAI: No, Chris, he's a dog. All right. I think you've got this under control. I'm gonna go sit on some babies.
CHRISTOPHER: Alright you do that, when you get back, we'll sprawl out on the couch and watch flat-screen plasma TV, and the world as you know it will never be the same.
[They kiss]
LORELAI: You smell good.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah?
[They kiss again]
LORELAI: Familiar. Is that my conditioner?
CHRISTOPHER: Maybe. I don't know.
LORELAI: Are you using my conditioner?
CHRISTOPHER: Sometimes. Why? You don't like to share?
LORELAI: No, I'm married now. I love to share.
CHRISTOPHER: So, why is it so funny?
LORELAI: You don't have that much to condition.
CHRISTOPHER: I know that, but…
LORELAI: it's just been really unruly lately?
CHRISTOPHER: All right. I got work to do here.
LORELAI: All right, listen, I love that you're using my conditioner, and I love that you're putting up this Jumbotron thingy all by yourself, and I can't wait to watch flat sports with you, and I love you -- goodbye.
CHRISTOPHER: I will be here.
LORELAI: Hey, if you feel like shaving, I've got a brand-new Lady Schick in the drawer. Feel free to use it.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh I might just do that.
COURT HOUSE – HALLWAY
[Luke is sitting on a bench alone, a court officer opens a door.]
COURT OFFICER: Danes vs. Nardini?
LUKE: Hmm?
COURT OFFICER: Custody case.
LUKE: Oh, yeah, right. Uh, no, Nardini is not here. Nobody is here. [the officer goes back in the room] I mean, well, nobody from -- okay.
JIM: Luke.
LUKE: Oh, hey, Jim. Hey.
JIM: Been waiting long?
LUKE: No, no, no, I got here early. I wasn't sure where to park, so I got here early.
JIM: Always a good idea.
LUKE: Yeah, listen, uh, I meant to ask you -- will I start with a statement or?
JIM: No, no, you won't start with any statement.
LUKE: Okay.
JIM: Actually, the less you say, the better, which is good because the more you say, the more they can, well, you know.
LUKE: Right, right, um will they make a decision right away? Do they tell us?
JIM: Listen, I got to make a quick call. Give me a sec?
LUKE: Oh, yeah, no. Go. Go right ahead.
[The elevator opens and Anna approaches]
LUKE: Oh, hey.
ANNA: Hello, Luke.
LUKE: They're not -- we're not --
ANNA: Oh, are we early?
LUKE: Yeah, I guess, or they're behind.
[Small nervous laugh, Luke watches Anna sit then joins her on the bench, the following conversation starts out nervous with lots of pauses.]
LUKE: Did you park in the garage?
ANNA: Hmm?
LUKE: Yeah, do I get this thing stamped or what?
ANNA: I don't know. I didn't park in the garage.
LUKE: Oh. Okay. [Put the parking pass in his pocket.] Man, this place, huh?
ANNA: Yeah, what a waste of time.
LUKE: Yeah.
ANNA: Especially since there's no reason for it.
LUKE: Well, I mean...
ANNA: But you have to finish what you started, right?
LUKE: What I started?
ANNA: Yes, when you hired a lawyer.
LUKE: Well, I had to hire a lawyer. It was the only way I could see my kid.
ANNA: [Scoffs] I mean, come on. You really think you have a chance?
LUKE: Yeah, well, that's for a judge to decide.
ANNA: Well, step back. Take a look at it. I mean, look at yourself. You're...you -- a hermit living above a diner in some old, converted hardware store. It doesn't exactly paint a picture of "capable father."
LUKE: It doesn't matter where I live, and I have been nothing but a good father to April.
ANNA: And you know what you're not gonna get any points for your history with women, either.
LUKE: I don't know what you're talking about.
ANNA: Bailed on Lorelai, got divorced in a b*at.
LUKE: I did not bail on Lorelai.
ANNA: You have had no long-term relationships, Luke. Why would a judge trust you to have one with April?
LUKE: April…huh!…Knows…
BARBARA: Hi. Anna, all set?
JIM: Hello, Barbara.
BARBARA: Jim. Can we go in?
COURT OFFICER: The judge is ready for you.
JIM: Perfect timing.
[They all enter lead by Luke, the door is closed by the court officer]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Rory enters, Paris is busy and has a number of large white boards set up.]
RORY: Hey, Paris.
PARIS: Hey Rory, just a second. I'm in the middle of something.
RORY: Did you have a good…
PARIS: No -- I have to set up the Goldman Sachs interview before spring break. My Christmas was fine, thank you. I assume yours was, too?
RORY: It was nice.
PARIS: Good. We've got the pleasantries out of the way. Can we move on?
RORY: I hope so. I am emotionally spent. What's all this?
PARIS: This is the game plan for what I call operation finish line.
RORY: Need more.
PARIS: Okay. We only have five months left before we leave the warm and comforting bosom of this university and face the bitterly cold shoulder of the real world.
RORY: "We"?
PARIS: You and I. You're the green marker. Green was a random choice, not a subtle comment about how inexperienced you are with real-life matters. Then again, maybe it was.
RORY: Hmm. Oh so I'm applying for an oceanography fellowship?
PARIS: And I might point out the application is due by February 28.
RORY: Yes but I know nothing about oceanography. I can't even tell you which direction the ocean is.
PARIS: You apply, you get the fellowship, then you decide if you want it.
RORY: I already know I don't want it.
PARIS: It's a defensive move. It's like monopoly. Your little wheelbarrow lands on St. James place. You think, "I don't want St. James place, "but I don't want some other schmo to get it, so I'll stick a plastic house there." Am I getting through to you?
RORY: You're making me want to play monopoly.
PARIS: Look, come the semester's end, you're gonna thank me for this chart. We cannot graduate unprepared.
RORY: Paris there is no way we're gonna have time to do all this stuff.
PARIS: I'm not saying it's not gonna be time-consuming, but there's two of us, so we'll divide it all up and report back to each other. I think we should have weekly report-back sessions. How about Friday afternoons at 5:00?
RORY: There's something to look forward to at the end of the week.
STARS HOLLOW – SOOKIE'S HOUSE
[Lorelai arrives at Sookie and Jackson's house and knocks]
SOOKIE: Jackson!
JACKSON: One minute.
SOOKIE: Jackson, get the door!
JACKSON: One minute!
LORELAI: That's okay. I'm fine.
SOOKIE: Get the door!
SOOKIE'S HOUSE – INTERIOR LIVING ROOM
JACKSON: Getting it, getting it. [Answering the door, Davey is hiding behind Jackson hold on to hit jumper.] Sorry, Lorelai.
LORELAI: That's okay.
JACKSON: I just put Martha down for a nap, and Sookie is getting dressed.
LORELAI: Okay.
SOOKIE: [From the other room] Ohh!
JACKSON: Ah, she's picking out an outfit now…
LORELAI: Gotta.
JACKSON: Thanks again for doing this.
LORELAI: Sure. So, where is Davey?
JACKSON: I don't know. I haven't seen him all day long.
LORELAI: Well that's too bad I brought over something special for him, but if he's not here, I'll just take it back home.
DAVEY: No!
LORELAI: Oh, there you are. Check out what's in my bag.
JACKSON: So, how's Christopher?
LORELAI: He's putting up a ginormous flat-screen as we speak.
JACKSON: Cool. What's the pixel aspect ratio?
LORELAI: It's got two remotes.
JACKSON: I'll ask him.
LORELAI: Good idea. [Sookie enters] Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey. [Too Jackson] Do you like this sweater on me?
JACKSON: Yeah, honey, it's great.
SOOKIE: I don't like it. I'm gonna change.
JACKSON: So, the four of us should go out sometime soon.
LORELAI: Sounds good.
JACKSON: I mean, I was gonna ask you two to join us next week in Woodbury for couples-bowling night, but you don't really seem like the couples-bowling type.
LORELAI: Why? What's the couples-bowling type?
JACKSON: I don't know, sort of boring married people.
LORELAI: But I am a boring married person now.
JACKSON: Do you even like bowling?
LORELAI: Not when I was single, but maybe now that I'm boring and married, it would be right up my alley.
JACKSON: You have to wear the shoes.
LORELAI: Forget it.
SOOKIE: How about this?
JACKSON: Ooh, that I really like. That's nice, the style and the color.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: No, it's all wrong. I'm gonna change.
LORELAI: Is she okay?
JACKSON: Sookie? Um, yeah, she's fine. So, buddy, what did Lorelai bring?
DAVEY: Her magic socks.
JACKSON: Wow.
LORELAI: I could tell you what they do, but it's kind of private between me and Davey. [Sookie comes back] Oh, yeah.
JACKSON: That's perfect -- perfect, perfect, perfect. Let's go.
SOOKIE: Are you sure?
JACKSON: Absolutely. Kinsey Millhone is waiting for you.
SOOKIE: You don't think it's a little too…
LORELAI: Looks pretty…
JACKSON: No, I love that sweater. Don't you, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Yes, I love, love, love it.
JACKSON: Great. See? Everything is great. See you later, buddy. Thanks again for doing this. Come on. Let's go.
SOOKIE: I can't leave them.
JACKSON: You can.
SOOKIE: No, I can't. They need me.
JACKSON: They're going to be fine. Come on. Let's go.
SOOKIE: Don't you want mommy to stay here and play with you?
Wouldn't that be fun? Wouldn't it Davey?
JACKSON: Come on let's go hit those slopes and crack those books. Thanks again, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Okay. Bye.
[Jackson and Sookie leave in a hurry]
LORELAI: All right. Come here. Let's see your magic socks. Let's see 'em. Come here. Where do you want to go?
DAVEY: The jungle.
LORELAI: The jungle? You better start kicking. Start kicking to get to the jungle. Kick! Kick! You got to kick to get there. Where's your tiger…
YALE – HALLWAY
[Rory is waiting on a bench, Richard comes out of his office]
RICHARD: Don't apologize, Connor. That's precisely why I have office hours. Oh, and I'm supposed to tell you that you can also query me by e-mail, although to be honest, I check it about as often as I do the daily racing form. [Laughs]
CONNOR: [shaking hands with Richard] Thanks.
RICHARD: Yeah. Mm-hmm. [Connor leaves] Miss Gilmore, I believe you're next. The visiting lecturer will see you now.
[They go inside]
RORY: Thank you. Oh, I like your office. It's cozy.
RICHARD: Hmm. That's one way of describing it. So, have you come as a loving granddaughter visiting your grandfather or as an obsequious student trying to butter up her professor?
RORY: Well, I'm not buttering up.
RICHARD: Oh, good.
RORY: Well, actually…
RICHARD: Oh, I thought I smelled butter.
RORY: You know my, uh, roommate, Paris?
RICHARD: Oh, I've met Paris.
RORY: Well, and you don't have to do this, but she wanted me to ask you if you might be able to help her to set up an informal get-together with Dean Kerrigan.
RICHARD: To what end?
RORY: I think she wants some kind of recommendation for after graduation.
RICHARD: I see.
RORY: And I guess it wouldn't hurt for me to meet him, as well. But you don't have to.
RICHARD: No I suppose I could speak to Dean Kerrigan. He's an affable gentleman. He's probably not averse to getting together for wine and cheese and meeting a pair of bright, soon-to-be graduates. I'll look into it.
RORY: Really? Okay. Thanks, grandpa.
RICHARD: So, I'm looking forward to having you in class again.
RORY: Me too.
RICHARD: I think you'll find this class more stimulating than last semester's. I'm expanding on some economic principles here, like pricing strategies under varying economic conditions that can be actually useful to -- sorry. I shouldn't bore you until you're sitting in my class, getting credit for it.
RORY: No, I'm not bored. I'm sorry, grandpa. I just have a lot on my mind.
RICHARD: Is everything all right?
RORY: I just -- it's senior year, you know, last semester. There's charts all over my apartment, and I'm going through something with a friend, so.
RICHARD: Paris?
RORY: No, someone else. I hurt her feelings, and even after writing her a very long letter of apology, she hasn't gotten back to me, and I just feel terrible.
RICHARD: I see. Well, I doubt it's as bad as you think it is. I'm sure the girl will get back to you. Maybe she's just a very slow reader.
RORY: [Sighs]
RICHARD: Oh, honey, anybody who knows you knows you would never do anything to purposely hurt someone's feelings.
RORY: Well that's just it. We don't know each other that well. She's a new friend. We don't have a history.
RICHARD: Hmm. Well, I wouldn't worry about it. Rory, you're a person of great heart and great character. And that combination will always win the day.
RORY: I hope so.
RICHARD: So, can I interest you in a syllabus?
SOOKIE'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai is on the couch watching TV]
MAN ON TV: Did you blow on the dice again?
MAN#2 ON TV: Yeah.
MAN ON TV: That's what I thought.
MAN#2 ON TV: This is my good friend Al Capone from Brooklyn….
[Lorelai gasps as she hears Sookie and Jackson outside]
JACKSON: I was just trying to be helpful.
SOOKIE: Cut it out, you're bugging me.
LORELAI: Hi. Wow, you're home early. I'm sorry it's such a mess. Um, the magic socks took us back in time. We were cavemen. It was really bleak, so we lived like this. I would've cleaned up, but when they woke up, the magic socks were gonna take us to an orphanage in England where they had to tidy up in exchange for one teaspoon of gruel.
JACKSON: Sounds fun. Don't worry about the mess.
LORELAI: So, how was the skiing/reading?
SOOKIE: Oh, uh, terrible.
JACKSON: Oh, come on. You had fun all morning.
SOOKIE: I could've had fun all day. We meet up for lunch. He spills my hot toddy all over the table, and he won't let me order another one.
LORELAI: "Let you"?
SOOKIE: Yeah, let me. He said if I ordered another, he'd do it again.
JACKSON: I just don't think drinking is appropriate at lunch.
SOOKIE: It was one drink.
JACKSON: Sometimes that's all it takes.
SOOKIE: And he wouldn't let me ski.
LORELAI: You mean read?
SOOKIE: No. Ski. "'S' is for 'silent'" sucked, so I thought, "why don't I strap on some skis and try a little downhill?" This one wouldn't let me.
JACKSON: Conditions were terrible. It was really icy.
SOOKIE: Well, apparently you make all the rules, your highness. Could I go check on my children? Could I do that, huh?
JACKSON: No, that's fine. Sounds good. [Sookie leaves and Jackson goes to the kitchen] So, thanks a lot for sitting. We really appreciate it.
LORELAI: Jackson, seriously, what's going on with you two?
JACKSON: Nothing much. You?
LORELAI: Jackson, why wouldn't you let her drink?
JACKSON: It's a bad precedent.
LORELAI: Or ski?
SOOKIE: I didn't want her to get hurt. You know there's all these snowboarders on the hill these days, and they just come tearing down…
LORELAI: Jackson!
JACKSON: Lorelai!
LORELAI: What is going on with you two?
JACKSON: Nothing.
LORELAI: You're acting strange.
JACKSON: No, I'm not.
LORELAI: So is Sookie. She's all over the place she's all weird and moody. The last time she was like that, she was pregnant.
JACKSON: What?
LORELAI: What?
JACKSON: What?
LORELAI: No.
JACKSON: No.
LORELAI: No?
JACKSON: Maybe?
LORELAI: [Gasps] Jackson, I thought you got a vasectomy.
JACKSON: Oh, so she says, "go get a vasectomy," and I'm just supposed to go get a vasectomy?
LORELAI: Well no you shouldn't do it if you didn't want to do it, but if you didn't want to do it, you should've told her you didn't want to do it.
JACKSON: I didn't see the point. Now I see the point.
LORELAI: Jackson.
JACKSON: She said she was staying on the pill. She said it gave her skin a healthy glow.
LORELAI: Yeah, she went off it last month.
JACKSON: I know that now you'd think that's the kind of thing a wife would tell her husband. Not when she thinks the husband had a vasectomy.
JACKSON: I know, I know.
LORELAI: Jackson, you have to tell her she's pregnant.
JACKSON: I was going to today after we had a great time and she was in a great mood, but then she wanted to ski and drink.
LORELAI: Well you wouldn't let her.
JACKSON: [whispering] She's pregnant.
LORELAI: Well I know that and you know that, but don't you think Sookie should be let in on the good news?
JACKSON: All right, all right.
LORELAI: Good luck.
JACKSON: Yeah. Thanks.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
[Jackson leaves the room to tell Sookie]
JACKSON: Honey? Honey?
[Speaking indistinctly]
SOOKIE: No!
[Coming back to the living room]
JACKSON: You can't just order someone to go get a vasectomy...
SOOKIE: You know what? J-just be really quiet right now! [Looking for her coat]
JACKSON: ...Like it's a haircut.
SOOKIE: Don't speak. Don't breathe. Don't even look at me. I'm gonna go for a walk, and while I'm gone, you're gonna have that taken care of.
JACKSON: But…
SOOKIE: No. No talking. Just do it, or when I get home, I will. Lorelai, let's go!



COURT HOUSE – HEARING ROOM
[Luke, Anna, the Judge and Lawyers are seated at a table.]
BARBARA: As we all know, your honor, custody cases must center on what's in the best interest of the child.
JIM: And as we all know, "best interest" is a subjective term.
BARBARA: For Mr. Danes to have as much access to April as he's seeking would certainly not be in her best interest.
JIM: To deny the child access to her father would be psychologically damaging.
BARBARA: Why? The child has only seen Mr. Danes on spur erratic occasions whenever he found time in his schedule to allow her to visit.
JIM: He made himself available to her as often as she liked.
BARBARA: Truth be told, during the past year, April has spent more cumulative hours with the man who drives her school bus than with Luke Danes. Why don't we ask my client to allow the bus driver shared custody of the child?
JUDGE: Bit of a stretch there, Miss Campbell.
BARBARA: My point, your honor, is that April's connection to Mr. Danes is superficial at best. To her, he's a man who works in a diner who only recently revealed himself to be her father.
LUKE: Owns. I own the diner. I don't just work there, and April came to me.
ANNA: Yeah, without my knowing it.
LUKE: Exactly and you hand no intention of letting me know I had a daughter.
JUDGE: Excuse me. I suggest you let your attorneys speak for you. It is why you pay them all your hard-earned money.
ANNA: I apologize, your honor.
LUKE: Yeah. Sorry.
STARS HOLLOW
[Sookie and Lorelai are walking down the street]
SOOKIE: I just -- and he really -- ohh! You know? And he didn't, and then I-I can't believe that he -- ohh! Ooh! You know, 'cause he didn't have -- he didn't, and I can't believe that he could've.
LORELAI: Sookie, you know you can't walk off a pregnancy, right?
SOOKIE: I had just delivered his baby, and then what? I'm supposed to go and hold my husband's hand while he gets a vasectomy to make sure he does? No. It's too much. I mean, I-I-I'm not his mother. I'm already a mother. You know I don't have the time to baby a grown man.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: I mean what am I supposed to do -- start watching him brush his teeth? Does he want me to start cutting his meat?
LORELAI: I don't think he wants his meat cut at all.
SOOKIE: Well, how could he do this?
LORELAI: I guess he didn't really want to have a vasectomy.
SOOKIE: Well, then, tell me.
LORELAI: I agree.
SOOKIE: Uhh!
LORELAI: I know. Uhh!
SOOKIE: I mean I didn't -- there was less than 4,000 left.
LORELAI: 4,000?
SOOKIE: Diapers.
LORELAI: Ah
SOOKIE: Diapers. For the last year and a half, I've been changing 20 diapers a day, I mean and finally -- finally I've got Davey. You know he's potty-trained. It's good. You know Martha has always gone through a little more. I mean, girls -- it's a boy-girl thing. I don't know. Boys seem to be perfectly happy sitting in their own filth.
LORELAI: I didn't know that.
SOOKIE: Yeah, and Martha is 12 diapers a day. And then if you add the -- but that's not the point. The point is that there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and now the light at the end of the tunnel is no more because you can't do that with 23 diapers a day. [Gasps] 26. If it's a girl, that's 26 diapers a day.
LORELAI: Well you could use cloth diapers, you know? You wash them and -- that's not the point. I mean that's not the point. I get it that's a lot of diapers. But, you know, babies are more than diapers, right?
SOOKIE: No, no.
LORELAI: Sookie.
SOOKIE: No, all I remember is eat, sleep, poop, eat, sleep, poop.
LORELAI: Well, there's other stuff.
SOOKIE: Yeah, like oh like diaper rash and colic and potty-training.
LORELAI: No, the good stuff.
SOOKIE: Well, I'm having trouble remembering that.
LORELAI: For one thing, they're pretty cute.
SOOKIE: Well, but cute is not gonna help me sleep through the night.
LORELAI: They smell great -- that newborn smell I mean, you can't b*at that, right?
SOOKIE: The smell is pretty good.
LORELAI: How about, you know, when you give them their first bath? And I remember when I gave Rory her first bath, she looked up at me like, "what the hell is going on?" And I kept saying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
SOOKIE: You know Davey loved his first one. Martha screamed bloody m*rder. Oh, my god, all the screaming.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but how about the first time when they're crying and crying, and you go in to pick them up, and then they stop crying because they recognize you?
SOOKIE: That's pretty cool.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: I'm not gonna sleep, though.
LORELAI: Well, you won't sleep, but you'll get another first smile.
SOOKIE: You know, Davey had his at three weeks. It's really advanced.
LORELAI: Aww, how about when you're lying down, you're holding the baby, and the baby falls asleep on your chest?
SOOKIE: They're all warm and cuddly. Oh, god, I know what you're doing. You're trying to make this sound good.
LORELAI: In the middle of the night, when you're rocking the baby, and everyone is asleep. And then they fall asleep, and you fall asleep.
SOOKIE: I'm hormonal, and you are playing dirty.
LORELAI: It's pretty good stuff, huh?
SOOKIE: I guess.
LORELAI: Really good.
SOOKIE: Are you talking memory, or are you thinking ahead?
LORELAI: Oh, uh, I don't know -- a little of both, I guess.
SOOKIE: Really?
LORELAI: Well, the subject has come up. It might come up again.
SOOKIE: Oh, my god, I'm gonna have another baby.
LORELAI: Yes, and I will be there to help you, no muffin tops required.
SOOKIE: Thank you. I know. Oh, god, I hope I have a girl. Ooh! Or a boy.
LORELAI: Well, chances are pretty good you'll have one or the other.
YALE – CAFETERIA
[Rory and Paris are having lunch, Paris has mini charts on the table]
PARIS: So, we seem to have a block of eight days here in late March that is disturbingly free of résumé-building activity -- might be a good time to commit to some volunteer work.
RORY: Sure.
PARIS: I'm not crazy about wheeling around elderlies in their revelling bathrobes, so I'm leaning towards tree planting.
RORY: Sounds good.
PARIS: I'll check out some local community-service sites online. Now I found out the cut off for the Lawrence Way journalism fellowship application is March 1st, so we have to get on that. And have you written your sample for the Iowa poetry prize?
RORY: Yeah, I think that one's a little farfetched. I mean, I only took one poetry class -- sophomore year.
PARIS: Hannah freeman is applying for a fulbright to study space travel in Luneberg, Germany. Do you think she's ever travelled to space? Besides, the writing sample is a poem -- takes 20 minutes to write, 2 if it's haiku.
RORY: I know but…
PARIS: You could've told me you were going to be so resistant to operation finish line when we agreed to it.
RORY: I'm sorry. When did we agree to it?
PARIS: And this is not about making charts. It's about our careers. It's about life. I'm trying to help you here. Did you talk to your grandfather about hooking me up with Dean Kerrigan?
RORY: [Distracted by seeing Lucy] Hmm? Um, yeah, I did. I did that.
PARIS: And?
RORY: Um, he said he'd look into it.
PARIS: "Look into it"? That's not going to cut it. You have got to put the screws to the guy. I don't care if he's your grandfather. He's part of our game plan, and he's got to play ball.
PARIS: Why do you keep...is that Lucy?
RORY: Yeah.
PARIS: Have you heard from her yet?
RORY: No.
PARIS: Oh, so now she's decided to just ignore you? How very "Heathers" of her.
RORY: I don't think she saw me. [Paris gets up and walks to Lucy.] Paris, no.
PARIS: Okay, look, it's time to put an end to this little junior-high game you're playing.
LUCY: Hey, Paris.
PARIS: Have you read Rory's letter or not?
LUCY: Um, yeah, I just…
PARIS: Well would you please tell her you forgive her and kiss and make up, because it's really messing with her head?
RORY: Um, sorry, Lucy, I didn't…
PARIS: Don't apologize. I've got her on the ropes.
LUCY: Look I just got back an hour ago, so I just read your letter.
PARIS: Yeah? And?
LUCY: Well, it's not really fair, I mean, you being a writer.
PARIS: Yeah, yeah, life's not fair. Can you let her off the hook, for god's sakes? In case you didn't know it, Rory is a great person, and she does not deserve to be treated this way.
RORY: Paris…
RORY: Anyone should feel lucky to call her a friend. I know I do, and you're throwing away one of the best.
RORY: Paris, please. I appreciate where this is coming from, but can we just have a minute?
[Paris leaves]
LUCY: It was a really beautiful letter.
RORY: Thanks.
LUCY: Look, I know that Marty put you in a really crappy position and…
RORY: Yeah, but I -- well, he did.
LUCY: Totally crappy.
RORY: But I could've said, "No, Marty, you're being stupid and immature."
LUCY: Which he was so being.
RORY: But I just -- I handled it wrong. I mean, can I say again how much I screwed up?
LUCY: No, you didn't screw up. Marty asked you to do something really weird and wrong, and you did it 'cause you're a great person. Ask Paris.
RORY: Well, I don't know about --
LUCY: Look I even tried to figure out what I would've done in your shoes, and, I mean, I even tried to act it out with Olivia playing the role of Marty.
RORY: Seriously?
LUCY: I know, right? Any chance to act. But um, it didn't really work because as much as I love Olivia, her Marty was so over-the-top.
RORY: Are things okay with you and Marty?
LUCY: Arr not so much. We broke up.
RORY: Oh, no.
LUCY: Oh, well, right?
RORY: I'm so, so sorry.
LUCY: No, I mean, it wasn't your fault. It wasn't meant to be. Listen, I got to go to my first class.
RORY: Oh, yeah, okay.
LUCY: But I'll call you, okay?
RORY: Okay. Yeah. See you.
[Back at the table]
PARIS: Everything okay now?
RORY: Yep.
PARIS: Good. Did you ask her about actresses she knows at Yale drama? Why have I even bothered to do all this?
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Chris is finishing hanging the Plasma]
CHRISTOPHER: Perfect. Yeah. There we go.
PAUL ANKA: [Barks]
CHRISTOPHER: What? That's straight. It's straight. Fine, you want me to prove it? I'll find a level and prove it. [looks in his tool box] Where's the level, Paul Anka? The level! [Claps at Paul Anka to get up] Find the level, boy! All right. You've been absolutely no help.
[Goes up stairs]
COURT HOUSE – HEARING ROOM
JUDGE: All right, now, Miss Nardini, what kind of provisions have you made for your daughter in New Mexico -- house, schools?
ANNA: Well I've already rented a house in a nice area, um checked out the immediate neighborhood, and there's a lot of kids there that are April's age.
JUDGE: Hmm.
ANNA: I have enrolled her in a local school that is very highly recommended, um, put her up for swim team.
JIM: Your honor, we don't contest that Miss Nardini will make April's transition to the new living situation as seamless as possible. We contest the part where she cuts the child off from her father.
BARBARA: A father she barely knows, who does not have -- let's face it -- the most sterling personal history.
LUKE: Okay. Look. I know what you're talking about, and, yeah, I've made a few mistakes.
JIM: Luke, hang on.
LUKE: It's true. I was married before, and it only lasted a few months, but it ended amicably...pretty much.
JUDGE: Mr. Danes, I need you to refrain…
LUKE: And I may live above a diner, and some people may see me as a hermit.
JIM: Luke.
LUKE: And I'm the first person to admit that you know all of my relationships haven't exactly been long-term.
JUDGE: Mr. Mcnally.
LUKE: Yeah, you know, but this is different. We are talking about my daughter, who I didn't even know I had for the first 12 years of her life. And now that I know her, and I know I'm her dad, I just want to be with her and be her dad 'cause I know I will be a good dad.
JUDGE: Mr. Danes, be quiet.
JIM: I'm sorry, your honor. This won't happen again.
LUKE: [Sighs]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LORELAI'S BEDROOM
[Chris enters still looking for the level]
CHRISTOPHER: Mm-hmm. Nope. [Sighs, opens a draw] Aha! All right. [then sees the note pad and picks it up]
COURT HOUSE – HEARING ROOM
JUDGE: Alright now that I've had the opportunity to hear from both sides in this case, I'm going to read some personal references into the court record. The first letter is written on behalf of Mr. Danes by a miss Lorelai Gilmore. This is dated January 9, 2007.
"To whom it may concern, In the nearly 10 years that I have known Luke Danes, I have come to know him as an honest and decent man. He's also one of the most kind and caring persons I have ever met."
[Cut to Chris reading the letter, we hear Lorelai's voice.]
LORELAI: "I'm a single mother, and I raised my daughter by myself, but once Luke Danes became my friend in this town, I never really felt alone. Luke and I have had our ups and downs over the years, but through it all, his relationship with my daughter, Rory, has never changed. He's always been there for her no matter what. He was there to celebrate her birthdays. He was there cheering her on at her high school graduation. Luke has been a sort of father figure in my daughter's life. With his own daughter, Luke wasn't given the opportunity to be there for her first 12 years, but he should be given that opportunity now. Once Luke Danes is in your life, he is in your life forever."
[Back to the court room, still reading the letter, back to the judge speaking]
JUDGE: "I know from personal experience what an amazing gift that is, and not to allow him access to his daughter" [cut to sh*t of Luke's reaction] "would be to seriously deprive her of all this man has to offer, and he offers so much. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Lorelai Gilmore."
[Closing sh*t of Chris finishing the letter.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
[Night time, Lorelai pulls up in the Jeep and goes inside.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – ENTRY
[Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Hiya! I want to see the TV. [Gasps] Holy cripes, that's big! Oh, my gosh. Does that come with a slushee machine and a gangly teenage usher? Honey, the deal with sookie...[sees the not pad] Chris?
CHRISTOPHER: I read your letter.
LORELAI: Honey, it's not a letter. It's just a character reference that Luke asked me to write for his court case.
CHRISTOPHER: Reads like a letter.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah?
CHRISTOPHER: Almost like a love letter.
LORELAI: No, it's a favor that Luke asked 'cause he needed…
CHRISTOPHER: You know what? Before you go through a whole list of excuses, let me just ask -- is our marriage for you basically just marking time?
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: Come on, Lore.
LORELAI: Of course not.
CHRISTOPHER: I mean obviously you still have very deep feelings for the guy.
LORELAI: No, no, I just have known him a long time, and he's...
CHRISTOPHER: always been there, always will be there.
LORELAI: Luke needed a character reference for court to prove that he deserves partial custody of April, and I know him really well.
CHRISTOPHER: Yes, you do.
LORELAI: And so it just made sense that he would ask me to write that character reference.
CHRISTOPHER: I can't believe I just had coffee from his place.
LORELAI: Coffee? Sweetie, I told you Sookie brought that, okay?
CHRISTOPHER: Do you still talk to him? I mean, do you see him?
LORELAI: This is crazy.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, I got a right. I have a right to know.
LORELAI: Occasionally I see him because we live in the same town.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, and I know you, Lore.
LORELAI: And?
CHRISTOPHER: And I know that you're not done with him.
LORELAI: Okay, this is ridiculous. This is -- hey, this is a ridiculous conversation, okay? I have a history with him, yes. I was engaged to him, yes. But I married you.
CHRISTOPHER: Tell me you're not in love with him.
LORELAI: I'm not in love with him.
CHRISTOPHER: [Sighs] I should've known. I mean, I mean, all the signs were there.
LORELAI: What signs?
CHRISTOPHER: The fact that you didn't want to leave stars hollow, that you were dead set against redoing the wedding, that you didn't want to have a baby with me. I mean, it's all because of him, right?
LORELAI: No. How can I tell… it's over, okay? What I had with him, it's over, Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: Then why did you hide the letter from me?
LORELAI: I wasn't hiding it. I put it in the drawer in case they lost the typed copy or the judge spilled coffee on it, the dog ate it. I don't know why I didn't tell you about it.
CHRISTOPHER: I think that it's because you're still in love with him.
LORELAI: No, I love you. I love you.
CHRISTOPHER: You know what? I-I'm sorry, Lore. I just -- I can't handle this.
LORELAI: Handle what?
CHRISTOPHER: This. You and him. I just -- I can't handle being your second choice. I thought I could, but I can't, all right? I can't be your rebound. I'm sorry.
[Chris leaves]
LORELAI: Christopher?
[The door closes]
LORELAI: Chris?
[Lorelai is left standing there in the kitchen]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Rory and Paris are at work on "Operation Finish Line"
RORY: Okay, I will check out the Poposaurus project at the Peabody, but there is no way I'm signing up for the LSATS.
PARIS: Sure you are. Don't get lazy on me now. The finish line is in sight.
RORY: I'm not being lazy, Paris. It's just I'm not interested in being a lawyer. I'm interested in journalism.
PARIS: Just because you go to law school doesn't mean you have to be a lawyer. Look at Dan Abrams he's a journalist but because of his law degree, he became the face of the Scott Peterson trial.
RORY: Well I don't want to be the face of the Scott Peterson trial, and I hate Dan Abrams. I will also not be taking the MCATS.
PARIS: Sanjay Gupta, senior medical correspondent at CNN, [Rory's phone rings] right now he's got the market cornered.
RORY: Well, good for Sanjay. [Answering the phone] Hello? Oh, hey, Lucy. Now? Um, yeah, yeah. Um no, that sounds great. I'll see you there. Okay. Bye. Grab your coats. We're going tray sledding.
PARIS: What?
RORY: We're gonna meet Lucy over at the dining hall, sneak out a couple of trays, and then go tray sledding down science hill. We can cross it off the list, come on.
PARIS: But tray sledding isn't slated to happen for a few more weeks.
RORY: Well that's okay there might not be as much snow in a couple weeks. And Lucy and Olivia happen to be going today, so let's go.
PARIS: Are you sure you want me to come?
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: Okay, okay.
RORY: Hey, uh, listen. Thanks for saying those things you said about me in the cafeteria.
PARIS: Oh, well, I just didn't want your juvenile hysterics to muck up the whole chart.
RORY: I know.
PARIS: I mean you two were behaving like children. I thought I was gonna have to put you on the naughty step.
RORY: Still, it's just nice to hear sometimes.
PARIS: You're not going to cry, are you?
RORY: No, I don't think so.
PARIS: Good.
RORY: Are you ready?
PARIS: I'm ready!
RORY: Let's go. Oh, wait. If you fall and break your face, as many tray sledders do, don't even worry about it 'cause you can spend the night in the infirmary, which is another typical college experience.
PARIS: Wait. What?
RORY: Come on.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LORELAI'S BEDROOM
[Lorelai is alone in bed and wakes up, she gets up and checks for Chris' car, it's not there, the phone rings]
LORELAI: Hello?
LUKE: [In his apartment] Hey, I didn't wake you, did I?
LORELAI: Uh, no, hi. No, I'm up.
LUKE: I just had to tell you. I won.
LORELAI: [still half asleep] You won?
LUKE: It's incredible. I thought I was screwed. I mean, her lawyer dug up every last bit of dirt she could find on me but.
LORELAI: Oh. Oh, yeah. Luke, that's great.
LUKE: Yeah, the judge waited until this morning to give us her decision. Oh, man, was that the longest night of my life. But I just got off with my lawyer. I get shared custody.
LORELAI: Wow. Congratulations.
LUKE: Yeah, I get to see April at least one weekend a month, every other major holiday, half the summer. We're gonna work it all out. It's so great.
LORELAI: So great.
LUKE: Yeah, I guess the judge just took everything into consideration and realized how much I wanted to be in April's life. And, of course, your letter was a big help.
LORELAI: Well, I just wanted to help you, help April.
LUKE: Well, you did, and I'm really grateful. Anyway, uh, sorry to call so early. Thanks again.
LORELAI: Congratulations.
[Lorelai hangs up then sighs]
YALE – CLASS ROOM
[Richard is teaching, Rory is there and looking on proudly]
RICHARD: Now, when it comes to papers, I'm guessing that some of you, of course, will be asking me for an extension. You will be happy to learn that I have no problem with extensions. [light laughter by the class] Here's what you do. You look at the due date of the paper, and then you mark it on your calendar two weeks prior to that date. And there you have it. I've just granted you a two-week extension. By the way, my office hours are every Tuesday morning, and you're welcome to come to me with any questions or problems, economic or non. My expertise extends beyond Keynesian theory, and I will be happy to lend an ear. So, let's get started. As you know, this course... [Breathless] Will take a specific look at... processes and determinants... of overall economic P...[Gasps softly and groans, falls to the floor as the screen fades to black]
WOMAN: [might be Rory] Someone call 911.

LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
[Lorelai and Babette are moving potted plants, Lorelai's cell phone rings]
BABETTE: Ooh! What is that?
LORELAI: It's just my phone.
BABETTE: Holy smoke! I don't know what I thought that was -- some alarm on your pants or something.
LORELAI: No, the pants alarm, pants alarm sounds more like a siren.
BABETTE: You want to answer that? Should we put this down?
LORELAI: No, no…
BABETTE: We could just…
LORELAI: No that's okay. I'm afraid if we put it down, we won't pick it up again.
BABETTE: Oh, this is gonna be good, what with this one here and the two palms. Oh, boy, Morey's eyes are gonna pop out of his head!
LORELAI: Why? Does he find plants particularly startling?
BABETTE: I'm making a jungle.
LORELAI: A jungle?
BABETTE: For the bedroom.
LORELAI: Ugh! Enough said.
[Telephone rings]
BABETTE: Hey, is that your inside phone?
LORELAI: Yeah I'll call them back.
BABETTE: So, anyway, I got this negligee with sort of a snake pattern.
LORELAI: Oh, boy! Is this heavy!
BABETTE: It is. It is. I'm sorry, doll. I wasn't hoping that you would lug this with me. I was planning on asking Christopher.
LORELAI: Oh yeah.
BABETTE: Yeah I haven't seen him much lately.
LORELAI: Oh well, his work keeps him busy.
BABETTE: Yeah what's he do -- something with computers? Very mysterious.
LORELAI: Yeah, he's a man of mystery.
BABETTE: Ohh, you know who's a man of mystery? Morey. [Lorelai cell phone rings] After decades in the bedroom, who would have thought that the idea of dressing up like a Howler monkey would be such a turn-on?
LORELAI: Right, I'm gonna get this, Babette.
BABETTE: All right.
LORELAI: [On the phone] Hello? Rory? Honey, what's wrong? [pause] Oh, no. On my way. [Ends call] Sorry, Babette!
BABETTE: [Breathing heavily] Morey!
OPENING CREDITS
HOSPITAL – WAITING ROOM
[Rory is sitting and her cell phone is ringing]
WOMAN ON P.A.: Dr. Forrest, dial 182, please.
WOMAN: Excuse me, miss. Is that your phone?
RORY: Oh. Um, sorry. H-hello?
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: I'm here.
RORY: Good.
LORELAI: Where are you?
RORY: I'm here. I'm in the waiting room.
LORELAI: Ah, okay. I must be in the wrong waiting room.
RORY: I'm not in the E.R. anymore, I'm in the cardiac intensive-care unit, the C.I.C.U.
LORELAI: That's where I am, I think. First floor?
RORY: First floor.
LORELAI: There's a red stripe on the floor.
RORY: It's kind of orange here.
LORELAI: Orange?
RORY: Reddish-orange, so maybe.
LORELAI: Well yeah maybe orangey red. Maybe the lights make it look more red. [Lorelai sees Rory] Oh. Hi.
RORY: Hey. [Exhales deeply] Um, they're doing tests, so that's where he is -- blood tests and another E.K.G. They did an E.K.G. In the ambulance, but I guess they're still trying to determine how much damage was actually caused by the heart attack. But that's definitely what it was. It was a myocardial infarction, which is a heart attack. And I guess the E.K.G. Tells them how bad the blockage of his arteries is and what degree of coronary-artery disease he has, or C.A.D., As they're calling it, because, apparently, everything is -- what do you call it? An anagram? What's the thing with the letters? Acronym. The C.A.D., C.I.C.U., The E.K.G.
LORELAI: Come here.
[They hug]
RORY: Ohh. Mom, it was awful. He just fell down.
[Lorelai rubs Rory's back]
LORELAI: [Sighs] It's gonna be okay.
HOSPITAL – WAITING ROOM
[Later Lorelai is on the phone]
WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Forrest, dial 182, please.
LORELAI: Hi, Chris, it's me again. Uh... I'm at the hospital now, and, um, it was a heart attack, but dad's okay. He's just getting some tests. So, um...we're in the C.I.C.U. At John Skinner Medical Center. It's on the first floor, and there's a red stripe running down the hallway. Just please call me when you get this, okay? Thanks. [Lorelai ends the call and sits with Rory, exhales sharply] Wow.
[The table is full off junk food]
RORY: Mm-hmm. Well, my brain wasn't up to choosing between things, so I got one of everything.
LORELAI: You do me proud. So, ah, grandma's on her way. I didn't talk to her, but the girl at the club said she's en route.
RORY: Oh, okay. And what about dad?
LORELAI: Oh, he's probably... en route.
RORY: Hmm. Is everything okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, I don't think he's gotten my messages yet, but he'll be here when he does.
RORY: Okay. Well... what is your pleasure?
LORELAI: Well, let's see. Uh...nothing sweet, I don't think.
RORY: No? A salty thing? A fluorescent-orange ersatz-cheese thing?
LORELAI: I guess I'm not hungry.
RORY: Yeah, me neither. I keep thinking this is all just a nightmare.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: But it's not.
LORELAI: No I mean it's a nightmare but not a nightmare nightmare. I know ‘cause I have shoes on. In my nightmares, I never am wearing shoes.
RORY: I didn't know that.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, It's the worst thing in the dream, too. I could be chased by snakes or in a nuclear expl*si*n, but then I look down, and, "oh, my god! I'm not wearing shoes!"
RORY: I wonder what that means.
LORELAI: Well it probably means I have a fear of you know hurting my bare feet or fear of losing my shoes.
RORY: Hmm. Not so Freudian, huh?
LORELAI: No for me, a snake is just a snake, a slingback is just a slingback.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Gilmore?
LORELAI: Oh.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Hi. I'm Dr. Goldstein. You're Richard Gilmore's family?
LORELAI: Yes. Is he okay?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: He's doing all right. He's conscious, cogent, and not in significant pain now.
RORY: Oh, good.
LORELAI: Good.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: We just sent him to the cath lab to get an angiogram. After that, we should be able to get a better sense of what kind of blockage is around his heart. And then we'll figure out where to go from there.
LORELAI: Like where would we go?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Uh, pardon?
LORELAI: I mean, where -- where would we go?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, if the blockage is more serious, we will have to consider an emergency bypass surgery.
LORELAI: Okay.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: I promise to let you know as soon as we get the results from the cath lab. Try not to worry.
LORELAI: No, no, not worried. Just normal amount of worried you know for someone whose father's had a heart attack, but not excessively worried.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: Okay thank you, doctor.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: I'll see you in a little bit.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Battaglia, extension 198.
[Emily enters the waiting room and see the girls.]
EMILY: Have you seen him?
LORELAI: Oh, hi, mom.
RORY: Oh no, not since he was in the E.R.
EMILY: Where is he?
LORELAI: Ah the doctor came out and said he's in the cath lab, getting an angiogram. He's gonna let us know when he's done.
EMILY: Nonsense.
[walks off the girls follow]
RORY: Oh no It's true. He said he would come back when he had the results.
[They come to the nurses station]
EMILY: I'm Emily Gilmore. And I would like to see my husband.
NURSE: Now lets see what is your husband's name?
EMILY: Gilmore! Richard Gilmore! I'm his wife, and I would like to see him now.
NURSE: I'm sorry he's in the cath lab right now getting an angiogram. But the doctor will come find you as soon as they're done.
EMILY: There's no need to be cheery about it.
NURSE: I didn't mean…
EMILY: Honestly someone with your chipper personality ought to be a weather girl or a preschool teacher.
NURSE: I'm sorry you feel that way.
EMILY: Oh, please. Don't mope.
[Emily walks off and Lorelai mouths "I'm Sorry" to the nurse]
EMILY: What happened to all the competent people? That's what I'd like to know. Was there some giant hole they all fell into or a virus that struck them all down, leaving the morons of the world to sit behind the desks?
LORELAI: Mum wouldn't you like to sit down, have a cup of tea?
EMILY: I don't want a cup of tea, what I want is the most perfunctory level of competence from the people with whom I interact. That apparently is far too much to ask for.
RORY: Grandma we have snacks.
LORELAI: Yes mum, snacks. We have salty snacks and sweet snacks and sweet/salty hybrid snacks.
EMILY: I mean even at the club, I'm tell you the young men and women that work there must have a combined I.Q. Of a grapefruit. You ask them for a towel, and they look at you with the most vacant eyes. I'm telling you I thought the girl at reception was blind the entire first month she worked there – blind but very enthusiastic about the application of eyeliner.
LORELAI: Sounds pretty.
EMILY: My husband has a heart attack, and how long does it take them to find me? 40 minutes. The nitwit probably got lost between the front desk and the tennis courts.
RORY: I'm sorry grandma that sounds terrible.
EMILY: I mean none of this would have been a problem if I'd been allowed to keep my cell phone. But no cell phones have been banned allegedly because of noise pollution. Well if that's the reason, they should ban John Abbott. Because I'm telling you every time that man hits a ball, he grunts like a rutting hog. [The girls look amused] I mean he's twice as loud as my cell phone. And they won't even let you leave your cell phone on vibrate, it preposterous. I mean what do they think we're doing, making drug deals?
LORELAI: I doubt that's it.
EMILY: Which, by the way, are absolutely, 100% taking place. I saw Devorah Inwood handing Cardum Kelly a small, blue pill in the ladies' locker room while they made shady eyes at each other.
LORELAI: Drug deals at the club? Mum I don't think so.
EMILY: Absolutely. The whole place is going to the dogs. Oh, and now apparently they want to start charging us for meals, on top of the king's ransom in dues. It's appalling. I mean the very idea of charging extra for the junk they serve there. Oh, and you know what really irks me?
LORELAI: Hmm?
EMILY: They very rarely serve fish.
LORELAI: That's terrible, especially for people who love fish.
EMILY: In a way it's their fault that Richard's here.
LORELAI: Mum what do you mean?
EMILY: 2 1/2 months ago, I read an article that said fish has been shown to prevent heart attacks and stroke and has innumerable other health benefits.
RORY: [Sees Logan] Hey. [Goes to him and they hug as Emily continues to talk.]
EMILY: It's the omega-3 fatty acids -- that and it's an incredibly lean source of protein. So I had the maid cut out the article so I could show it to Richard. He agreed to eat more fish, but he said not for dinner. My spineless kitchen staff caved.
LOGAN: Emily, Lorelai, I'm so sorry. How are you holding up?
LORELAI: We're holding.
EMILY: Logan, it's so good of you to come.
LOGAN: Is there anything I can do? Could I get you a cup of tea maybe?
LORELAI: Oh I just asked. She doesn't want tea.
EMILY: I would love a cup of tea. That's very kind of you.
LOGAN: I'm on a tea hunt, then. That's a fine young man, Rory -- very sweet, very considerate.
RORY: I like him.
EMILY: He's one of the good ones. Lorelai, where's Christopher?
LORELAI: Oh, he's on his way.
EMILY: From where?
LORELAI: Um, uh...Dr. Goldstein.
EMILY: I'm Emily Gilmore.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Good. I'm glad you're here. The blockage is worse than we'd hoped. I think the best course of action -- really the only course of action -- is to do an emergency bypass surgery.
LORELAI: Open-heart surgery?
EMILY: Let him finish, Lorelai.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: We'd like to go into surgery as soon as possible. So now would be the time if you'd like to visit him.
RORY: Yes, yeah, we'd like to see him.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: If you'll follow me please.
HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Feel free to ask me any questions you might have.
EMILY: Are you the one who will be performing the surgery?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, along with a team. I'll be the chief surgeon.
EMILY: And where did you go to school?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry?
EMILY: You did attend school, didn't you?
LORELAI: Mom.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: No, it's okay. Yes, I got my B.A. At Yale. I went to medical school at Harvard. I did my residency at Columbia Presbyterian before I became chief of cardiothoracic surgery here.
EMILY: See?
LORELAI: See what?
DR. GOLDSTEIN: Now here we are. I'll let you visit. A nurse will be by shortly to begin prepping Richard for surgery.
EMILY: Thank you, doctor.
[Emily and Rory enter, Lorelai pauses for a moment at the door]
EMILY: Richard how are you doing.
RORY: Hi grandpa
EMILY: I meet you doctor now think he's quite competent And I watched his hands closely and they're steady as a statue's. Oh, and, Richard, he's Yale undergrad, Harvard medical school.
RICHARD: You don't say. Well, if he does a good job I'll, I'll forget the Harvard part. I'll write that off as a youthful indiscretion.
[Chuckles]
EMILY: This room is rather intimate.
RICHARD: It's just fine, Emily. I promise you. Now, Rory, I'm sorry I gave you a scare in class today.
RORY: No don't be silly. I'm just glad you're okay. And you're gonna be more okay after the surgery.
RICHARD: Thank you.
LORELAI: Are you okay, dad? I mean how are you feeling, considering everything? You look okay.
RICHARD: Well all in all, I think I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
RORY: [Chuckles] Ronald Reagan.
RICHARD: Quoting W.C. Fields.
RORY: Oh, I didn't know that.
LORELAI: It would be great now. You know winter is a great time to see the Liberty Bell and the cream cheese. That's all I got on Philadelphia.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Well the cheesesteaks -- the Philly cheesesteaks.
EMILY: Lorelai please, Richard, is your neck getting enough support? It looks like you need another pillow.
RICHARD: Ah I don't know I think it's all right.
EMILY: Ah you need another pillow.
LORELAI: I got it, mom.
EMILY: I can take care of it.
LORELAI: I'm just handing you a pillow.
EMILY: I don't want that pillow.
LORELAI: What wrong with this pillow.
EMILY: It doesn't have a pillowcase.
LORELAI: Yes It does. What's this, it's a pillowcase.
EMILY: Yes, it has one pillowcase. It should have two pillowcases one facing each way so the pillow is never exposed. Now I have to ring for a pillow.
LORELAI: Mother we have a pillow right here, why would…
RICHARD: Tucson.
LORELAI: What?
RICHARD: Tucson is extremely hot, and it has a dry climate that doesn't agree with me, and I really don't think much of the way they dress out there. And I have a deep aversion to cacti of all kinds. And yet Tucson is a place where I think I would rather be.
LORELAI: Anywhere but here, right, dad? Although, it's awfully dry.
RORY: And so hot.
EMILY: And you're right about the fashion -- ponchos and all that turquoise. Oh, and men in sandals. Spare me.
[Chuckles]
LUKE'S DINER
[Zach is filling in for Lane]
LUKE: So, how's it going there, Zach?
ZACH: Aces. [To customers] Pastrami on Rye -- mustard, no mayo. Cheeseburger -- Swiss, double pickles, fries. If you need anything else, just holler. My name's Zach, and, uh...I'll be your waiter.
LUKE: So you holding up okay?
ZACH: Oh yeah. I'm tell ya, I was not looking forward to filling in for Lane deal. So I was like oh no! and she's like, "it's either this, or you fill in during the whole childbirth deal."
LUKE: Which would probably be a bit more difficult.
ZACH: Yeah right plus handing out food is cake compared to having a human being come out of you -- no offense.
LUKE: None taken. You're doing a good job.
ZACH: Oh, man, I gotta tell ya it's been great. I mean, it's been enlightening. Like always In the past, I was the one sitting at the table, and now I'm the one with the notepad and the pencil.
LUKE: You're on the inside.
ZACH: It's cool.
LUKE: Don't let the power go to your head.
ZACH: No kidding. You know what was freaking me out before? I'm about to hand people the food they're going to eat, and I could do anything to it, and they would have no idea. I mean they would just eat it. Not that I would, of course, but it's just intense. Plus, everything smells so good. I can see why Lane digs this job.
LUKE: Well, your enthusiasm is appreciated.
ZACH: Right on. Hey, you have another rag? [hands him one] Cool.
BABETTE: Hey, Luke?
LUKE: Hey, Babette. What can I get you? You still stocking the jungle with snacks, whatever that means?
BABETTE: Luke, I got to tell you something. Or, I don't know if I got to, but I want to. Well it's not that I want to like it's a good thing. Lorelai's dad had a heart attack.
LUKE: [Stunned] Oh, my god.
BABETTE: Rory called Lorelai and I was there.
LUKE: Is he okay?
BABETTE: Well, he's not -- he's okay...I think...right now. They're at john skinner, and I don't know, that's all I know.
LUKE: Oh, my god.
BABETTE: Yeah I-I thought you would want to know.
LUKE: Yeah, yeah, thanks.
BABETTE: All right. Well, I'm gonna go.
LUKE: Yeah. Thanks.
ZACH: You know what it's like? Working here is like having a backstage pass at a show. It's all-access, man.
LUKE: [still in shock] Right. Right.
HOSPITAL – HALLWAY
[Lorelai is on the phone]
LORELAI: Hey, it's me again. I don't know if you got my other message. Uh...we're still here at the hospital, and, uh... dad's gonna have surgery. He's having a coronary bypass pretty soon. I just came from his room, and, um...he doesn't look bad, you know? He looks okay, considering. But, uh... he's lying down. He just -- just looks so small. It just made me think of this time. There was a tree in our yard I would always climb, and one day, I climbed up really, really high. Dad came home from work. I watched him go into the house. I thought, "he looks so small." It was so strange to see him look like that. Um...[Sighs, the phone beeps for call waiting] Anyway, I should go, but, uh... call me when you get this, okay? Bye. [switched to the other call] Hello?
SOOKIE: How are you? How is everything? What can I do?
LORELAI: Oh no it's okay. I'm okay. Um dad had a heart attack, and he's gonna have surgery. But I guess it's a pretty common operation, so...
SOOKIE: And how are you?
LORELAI: I'm okay, considering.
SOOKIE: What can I do?
LORELAI: Oh, nothing, hon. I'm fine.
SOOKIE: Well can I send you anything? You know I made lemon bars and, ooh, pecan squares, I packed them up and I'm sending them over with Katie right now.
LORELAI: Oh, that was so sweet.
MICHEL: Is that Lorelai?
SOOKIE: Yes. Her dad's in surgery, but he's fine. [Too Lorelai] How is Rory doing?
LORELAI: Rory's doing fine, thanks.
MICHEL: Tell Lorelai I say hello.
SOOKIE: Michel says hello.
LORELAI: Tell Michel I said hello.
SOOKIE: She says hello.
MICHEL: Tell Lorelai I am thinking of her father and wishing him well.
SOOKIE: He's thinking of your father and wishing him well.
LORELAI: Tell Michel "thank you."
SOOKIE: She says "thank you."
MICHEL: Tell Lorelai the Zimmerman's in room 4 are not a married couple, as we had thought, but a brother and a sister.
SOOKIE: No I'm not telling Lorelai that. She's in a hospital.
MICHEL: Tell her they requested a rollaway bed, and we do not have any rollaway beds left.
SOOKIE: I am not talking to Lorelai about rollaway beds.
MICHEL: Tell her the Zimmerman's are demanding, very big, and they need a bed!
LORELAI: The Murray's are checking out at 3:00. and he can use the bed from their room.
SOOKIE: She said you can take the rollaway bed from the Murray's. They're checking out at 3:00.
MICHEL: Ahh! Very good. Tell her "thank you."
SOOKIE: He says "thank you" and apologizes for being such a pest.
MICHEL: Tell her I miss her here very, very much!
HOSPITAL – NURSES STATION
[Emily is on a phone and the nurse is not looking happy, Lorelai arrives]
EMILY: Well then don't stick us in the back corner next time. Oh you did you absolutely did, Anthony. I was so close to the kitchen, I could have reached in and gotten my own plate without standing up, just stretched out my arm like Rubberman, and... [Chuckles] No, no, I'm just kidding. So, tell me, what's your special tonight? Sea scallops? Oh, you're torturing me, Anthony, torturing me. Well, give my love to your wife. Oh, I will. Oh, just one of those last-minute business trips. [Lorelai doesn't look happy either] All right, then. Bye-bye.
LORELAI: Well somebody's very chipper on the phone. Somebody should consider a career as a weather girl.
EMILY: Oh please I've spent years cultivating my relationship with the maitre d' at Persephone's. I'm hardly about to let it go down the drain in one night. [Marking off a check list] "Call Persephone's" -- done. We're missing the sea scallops. Persephone's does the most wonderful job with seafood. I wish we'd eaten there more often. It's such a shame. They make a cedar-plank salmon that is -- I don't know if you like salmon.
LORELAI: Ah no, but I love a nice, juicy cedar plank.
EMILY: Salmon is one of the best fish in terms of the omega-3s. It's marvelous for you, and it makes your skin positively glow.
LORELAI: Beauty tips are not really big on my list of priorities right now, mom.
HOSPITAL – WAITING ROOM
[Logan's cell phone is vibrating on the table]
RORY: So I tell Paris, "I don't care if it would theoretically increase my chances of getting a grant to study in Russia. I am not willing to pretend to be an accomplished rhythmic gymnast."
LOGAN: How do you pretend to be a rhythmic gymnast, anyway?
RORY: I don't even know. Do you whirl around some ribbons? Balance a ball on your nose? She's taking our impending graduation with a pinch of total insanity. Logan you should answer that.
LOGAN: Nah.
RORY: It's practically buzzing off the table. Really I don't mind.
LOGAN: I'll text them back in a minute.
RORY: But you need to…
LOGAN: I don't need to do anything but be right here with you.
RORY: Well, are you sure? Aren't people gonna be mad you're not answering your phone?
LOGAN: Well that's their problem.
RORY: You know who's gonna be mad at me? Paris. Because right now, I'm missing a G.R.E. Prep course and tea with the Branford librarian.
LOGAN: I imagine she'll understand.
RORY: Um Paris?
LOGAN: Maybe you better start balancing a ball on your nose.
[Emily and Lorelai come around the corner]
EMILY: I need to cancel Richard's tennis match. And I guess I'm not gonna make it to my book club tomorrow. Which is just as well -- I haven't even cracked the cover. Whatever gives Suzanna Shaw the idea that the rest of us share her barbaric interest in Cormac McCarthy is beyond me. Now let's see. I need to return the dean's call, and -- [spotting Luke] oh, no. Not him again. What's he doing here?
LORELAI: I don't know.
LUKE: Hey…
LORELAI: Hi.
LUKE: I was just in the diner. Babette came and told me your dad had a heart attack.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: I swear I didn't even know what I was doing. I just walked right out the diner and drove straight here. Now that I'm here I realize I might be in the way, but if there's anything I can do, I want to do it.
LORELAI: Uh...well…
RORY: Hi, Luke.
LUKE: Hey, Rory, Logan.
LOGAN: Want some coffee?
LUKE: No, I'm okay. Thanks very much. [back to Lorelai] Look, I don't want to cause any kind of weirdness here. I mean, I don't want to make him feel…
LORELAI: Christopher isn't here, but he will be any second, so...
LUKE: Okay I'll just get out of here.
LORELAI: I mean thanks. There's just not much for you to do.
EMILY: Oh, yes, there is, absolutely. There's plenty for you to do Luke. You can drive to the Yale campus and pick up Richard's car.
LORELAI: Mom, he can't do that.
LUKE: No it's no problem.
EMILY: I'm not exactly sure where it's parked, but it shouldn't be too hard to find. Check the faculty lot and wherever they have parking. It's a 2006 jaguar. It's green. Oh, and I think it's a little low on gas. [Lorelai looking upset at Emily] So if you wouldn't mind filling the t*nk on the way back to the house, that would be great.
LUKE: Okay sure.
EMILY: Okay I'll get the key.
LORELAI: Mum is he supposed to drive the car to the house, then what take a cab all the way back to Yale to get his truck?
EMILY: I have no objection to that.
LUKE: Seriously It's no problem.
EMILY: See, now fill it with premium, not whatever sludge they try to pass off as regular.
LUKE: Premium, you got it.
EMILY: You do know how to drive a European car, don't you?
LORELAI: Mom.
LUKE: Absolutely. Don't worry.
EMILY: There's nothing to yank. It's a jaguar, not a lawn mower.
LORELAI: Oh, my god!
EMILY: Now just leave the key with Soledad. And...here. You can keep the change.
LUKE: oh Emily thanks, really, really, it's my pleasure.
EMILY: If you insist. If you don't mind terribly, I need someone to make sure that the path to the front door is shoveled.
LORELAI: Mother, stop.
EMILY: [Answering her cell phone] Hello? Oh, hello. You got my message about the fish.
LORELAI: Sorry. We're all a little... and she read an article about how fish can prevent heart attacks. Now she thinks it's the key to everything.
LUKE: Ah well, fish is good.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: All right, I should get going.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, thanks.
EMILY: Yes! Goodbye! [end phone call] Another incompetent. Lorelai go and get Luke back. I need him to bring a check for the fish man.
LORELAI: Mom I'm not. He's done enough already. Why don't you reschedule the fish man for later in the week.
EMILY: Because this is important.
LORELAI: It's important to have fish at the house right now?
RORY: Well Logan and I can meet the fish man, with the check if you want.
EMILY: Oh that would be marvelous.
RORY: Okay I want to get some of grandpa's stuff so he has it when he wakes up.
LORELAI: Wait a minute I'll do that.
RORY: Do what?
LORELAI: You pay the fish man, and I'll get some of grandpa's stuff.
RORY: Oh mum that's silly. They're in the same place.
LORELAI: Yes but then we'll both have a job. You have a job and I have a job.
RORY: Yeah but going to grandma and grandpa's is one job. Somebody needs to look after grandma.
LORELAI: Fine.
RORY: I mean if you really want…
LORELAI: No fine, she's my mother.
RORY: Well, you're my mother.
LORELAI: Exactly. It's a tangled web.
EMILY: Here you go, Logan. Now have him put the Salmon, Swordfish, King Mackerel, and Tuna in the downstairs freezer and the Trout, Sea Bass, Snapper, and Bluefish in the butler's pantry.
LOGAN: Salmon, Swordfish, King Mackerel, Tuna downstairs. Trout, sea bass, snapper, Bluefish upstairs. If you rode in the ambulance, you and I don't have a car here.
LORELAI: Oh take it before I change my mind. [Hands Rory the Jeeps keys] Level 3.
RORY: Thanks. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye. I'll be here doing my job.
RORY: How come you don't have a car?
LOGAN: Well I came by chopper.
RORY: Chopper motorcycle or chopper helicopter?
LOGAN: Helicopter.
RORY: You came here in a helicopter?
LOGAN: Yep. [voices fade as they walk away]
EMILY: Oh, I do need to call Quentin. I wonder if they have a fax machine here. And I'm hungry. Are you hungry?
LORELAI: I don't know, probably. I should be. Don't feel hungry.
EMILY: Alright then we should get something to eat. But first, I want to see if those addled nurses will allow me to use their fax machine.
LORELAI: [Looks at her phone for any messages, then sighs when she sees none]



LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
[Babette is trying to get Paul Anka of the porch, she is on the phone.]
BABETTE: [Grunts]
LORELAI: Hello?
BABETTE: It's me -- Babette. How you doing, sweetie?
LORELAI: Oh, hey. I'm okay.
BABETTE: What's the news with your dad?
LORELAI: Well he's in surgery right now, but we think he's gonna be okay.
BABETTE: Oh yeah, I'm sure. Don't you worry about a thing. He's a very vital man you dad -- lots of chi, you know?
LORELAI: Oh...really? I didn't know you noticed his chi.
BABETTE: Are you kidding me? Prana, chi, life force -- whatever you call it, your daddy's got it in spades. Sexy men like him often do. That's what makes them so sexy. They're ripe with life.
LORELAI: O-kay.
BABETTE: He's gonna be fine.
LORELAI: Thanks, Babette.
BABETTE: He's like Warren b*at, your dad -- or Sean Connery or -- who's that one I always found so sexy? The evil politician with the glasses -- Henry Kissinger!
LORELAI: Oh yeah I know him.
BABETTE: You might not agree with his politics. You might have lived through Vietnam and thought, "wow that man is the devil," but you can't deny he's sexy. You know why? Chi.
LORELAI: I get it. So, how's Paul Anka?
BABETTE: Oh, yeah, he's great, just great.
LORELAI: What's wrong?
BABETTE: I don't want to bother you.
LORELAI: Go ahead.
BABETTE: Oh, nothing to worry about. It's just... I'm afraid his bladder's gonna explode. I can't get him to come with me. I'm sure he needs to relieve himself, but it's a no-go. He's a no-go.
LORELAI: Oh Babette I should have told you he's probably afraid of the porch steps. You just lay something down for him.
BABETTE: Oh, yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah.
[She takes off her coat and puts it on the steps]
BABETTE: Wow! Yeah, that worked great. Wow. He's got some chi of his own, this one. Ooh. Only problem is...
LORELAI: What?
BABETTE: Nothing, nothing. It's just a little cold without my coat, that's all. Not your concern. So um, sweetie, if you need anything else, you'll call me?
LORELAI: Okay, I'll call you.
BABETTE: Okay. Give my love to your father.
LORELAI: I will, Babette. Hey, thanks for calling.
BABETTE: Oh, sure thing, hon. Bye.
GILMORE MANSION – RICHARDS OFFICE
[Logan and Rory are getting things for Richard, Logan is on the phone.]
LOGAN: Uh-huh, right. No, it's not a problem. It's perfectly understandable. So from there you want to take a right on Sycamore, left onto old Sawbrook, and then... that's right. No, I mean a left into the driveway. I mean that's correct -- making a left. I mean, a left is the correct choice. Right. That's correct, I mean. Okay, great. Great. Alright we'll be here. See you soon.
RORY: Well sounds like Abbott and Costello got nothing on you and the fish man.
LOGAN: You liked the "right/right" business? It could use polish, but me and the fish man have plans to bring back vaudeville.
RORY: Oh I'm gonna book the Palace theater, "Logan and the fish man".
LOGAN: "The fish man and Logan."
RORY: He gets top billing?
LOGAN: He's the one who can juggle. [Logan's cell phone starts to vibrate] Anyway the snow delayed him, but he should be here in 15 minutes.
RORY: Okay, I think your blackberry is going to explode.
LOGAN: Ah it's business stuff -- nothing that can't keep.
RORY: Business stuff, huh? Business stuff that has to do with the chopper you flew in on?
LOGAN: We don't have to talk about it now.
RORY: Oh come on I'm interested. I want to know. And also, I could really use the distraction. Besides, I want to make sure you haven't stolen a chopper.
LOGAN: I didn't steal it, it was loaned to me by a hedge-fund manager.
RORY: Ohh, well...
LOGAN: I was at his country home in Montauk when you called, and he just...
RORY: Loaned you his chopper, as they say.
LOGAN: Pretty much.
RORY: Well I think loaning someone your chopper is a sign of trust in many cultures. That sounds like a good sign.
LOGAN: Yeah, I think it is a good sign.
RORY: So come on what do you need funding for? Just tell me something. I don't want to be nosy, but I'm really interested. Come on. Come on.
LOGAN: Okay, you asked for it, so here it goes. I want to buy another Internet company.
RORY: I see.
LOGAN: It's a web-based, interactive-media platform. This guy in Austin created it. And it's amazing, and fast, and so easy to use, that even I can use it. The idea is to build on the web presence we have and then turn into ourselves into a user-generated media hub where the members can share videos, articles, ideas anything.
RORY: That sounds like a good idea.
LOGAN: Yeah and it's a deal, too. The guy who created this platform is such a true blue computer geek, that he just wants to get started on his next project, so he's willing to sell for only $5 million.
RORY: Oh, only.
LOGAN: I know. I know. But in this world, that's relatively cheap. I mean Chad Hurley and Steve Chen sold YouTube for $1.65 billion, and who knows how much Mark Zuckerberg will get for Facebook?
RORY: Well yeah, comparatively.
LOGAN: Anyway so I'm planning on putting up $3 million of my own money. And I'm just trying to line up a hedge fund to kick in the other $2 million.
RORY: You have $3 million?
LOGAN: Yeah, in my trust fund.
RORY: Yeah but I thought this was a business thing, I mean haven't you asked your dad? I thought you were working for him.
LOGAN: I went to him I pitched him the idea, and he rejected it. I have to move fast I have to take this deal off the market before one of the big-dog companies sniff me out and try to outbid me. You still want to take this chess thing?
RORY: Yeah, we should. Well, you sound really excited.
LOGAN: I am. It's exciting. The economies of scale are incredible. I just need to prove out the business model first.
RORY: Yeah and the barriers to switching for your current clientele will probably increase, too.
LOGAN: Yes exactly that's what my father doesn't understand. The opportunity cost of not doing it is that somebody else will, and the barriers to switching -- hey.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: Are actually you using business-speak? Are we speaking businessese?
RORY: I believe we are.
LOGAN: Color me impressed.
RORY: I take economics.
LOGAN: Sure, with professor Gilmore.
RORY: Yeah. We learned about ideal business theory last semester. I'm actually really enjoying his class. I've learned a lot. He's a really good teacher, which isn't always a given, you know. I mean some smart people can't translate their smarts to other people, but he is really good at explaining things, and he makes you want to learn more. Next week, we're gonna split up into 10 groups, and each of us have to create a business plan.
LOGAN: Like "The Apprentice."
RORY: Yeah and he's gonna be like Donald Trump, which is ridiculous. [Logan chuckles] Actually, we don't know what's gonna go on next week, do we?
LOGAN: I guess not. But it's good -- you got him a bunch of stuff to read.
HOSPITAL – CAFETERIA
[Lorelai and Emily in line for food]
EMILY: I hardly know what anything is. That pale misshapen thing, is that a sandwich or a piece of chicken.
LORELAI: Maybe it's a chicken sandwich, oh no it's Quiche.
EMILY: That's a Quiche?
LORELAI: Quiche.
EMILY: That blobby white thing is suppose to be Quiche Lorraine.
LORELAI: Doesn't say it's Quiche Lorraine, maybe it's Quiche blobby white thing.
EMILY: The audacity charging money for this.
LORELAI: Well it's hospital food.
EMILY: What's that suppose to mean?
LORELAI: I'm just saying it's a cliché.
EMILY: What is?
LORELAI: Hospital food being bad.
EMILY: Exactly!
LORELAI: What.
EMILY: It's a cliché for a reason, clichés are just true things people are tired of being true. Like a "penny saved is a penny earned", well it is invested wisely.
LORELAI: I don't think that's a cliché mom.
EMILY: What do you mean, of course it's a cliché.
LORELAI: It's not a cliché its more an over used saying like um "Sweating b*ll*ts" or "It's as cold as ice".
EMILY: Well some over used sayings are true, like "Children should be seen and not heard".
LORELAI: "Mother knows best"
EMILY: "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all"
[Emily's cell phone rings]
EMILY: Hello, oh Quentin hello.
[Emily walks off leaving Lorelai with the food trays, she follows Emily to a table]
EMILY: No I'm not busy at all, you haven't interrupted a thing, thank you for returning my call so promptly. Oh that's very kind Quentin, that's right, yes. Oh I'm fine, thank you. Listen it's been a while since some of the paperwork, yes I was wonder if you could fax some things over here to the hospital, I think I have access to a machine. Well the first thing I'd like you to fax is his will. [Lorelai looks surprised] That's right both the standard Will and the living Will. Well I'm not sure about the DNR provisions he established. Oh that would be wonderful, thank you Quentin, talk to you soon bye.
LORELAI: Mom who was that?
EMILY: Do we like this table or are we too close to that man with the IV. Honestly shouldn't there be a separate dining area for sick people, doesn't seem right.
LORELAI: Mother you're getting dads will faxed here?
EMILY: Yes.
LORELAI: Why you need to read it right now?
EMILY: Well yes.
LORELAI: You want to make sure he left you the Mercedes and Jag?
EMILY: I don't care what you think I'm being pragmatic.
LORELAI: You know what, I'm not hungry any more.
[Lorelai gets up and leaves]
GILMORE MANSION – FRONT DOOR
[Logan is saying good bye to the fish man]
FISH MAN: Yeah, that's a good one.
LOGAN: [Laughing] Yeah, all right.
[Closes the door, Rory coming down the stairs]
RORY: Here's this. I also found a bunch of his albums -- Bobby Short singing Cole Porter, a couple of his favorite Gershwin ones -- "Rhapsody in Blue" and "An American in Paris" -- also a couple of Scott Joplin records, although Scott Joplin might be a little zazzly for the hospital.
LOGAN: Yeah, I don't know what their policy about ragtime is.
RORY: Oh, I also found "Chuck Berry at the Fillmore," which I gave him for his 60th birthday. Also, a little Schubert and Debussy, which should be nice and relaxing. Although I didn't find the Bing Crosby album I wanted. It's with his son Gary. It's this song called "When You and I were Young, Maggie Blues." And when grandpa hears it he sings along and says, "I always wanted to be a crooner."
LOGAN: Maggie Blues, you want me to help you look?
RORY: Well I looked, I looked in two closets and under a couch, and all I found was the sleeve. I mean I could take it just for decoration, but then it might underline the fact that we don't have "Maggie Blues."
LOGAN: Yeah I'd bring it.
RORY: Yeah?
LOGAN: Yeah. So the fish man successfully unloaded all the fish per your grandmother's request.
RORY: Oh good and everything worked out with the check?
LOGAN: Yep, the fish man was happy because I laughed at his C.O.D. Joke.
RORY: Hmm?
LOGAN: C-o-d -- cod.
RORY: Ohh.
LOGAN: Yeah, just like that.
RORY: Hmm. That fish man, he's a funny one.
LOGAN: Believe me, I know. I'm Hardy to his Laurel.
RORY: Okay we have a deck of cards, we have the chessboard. We have what I think is a backgammon set. I grabbed grandma two outfits, grabbed her a pair of pants because I wanted her to be comfortable, but then I thought that might be offensive to her.
LOGAN: Offensive how?
RORY: I have no idea. So then I grabbed a skirt, but then that opened up the whole stockings, pantyhose, "going through my grandma's underwear drawer" can of worms. And each outfit needs a different top and a pair of shoes. Do you want to know who rivals Imelda Marcos?
LOGAN: Emily Gilmore?
RORY: It's unbelievable. No biped needs that many pairs of shoes. Oh do you know what else I wanted to grab? By grandpa's bed, there is a bookmarked copy of "A Monetary History of the United States."
LOGAN: Because who doesn't love Milton Friedman?
RORY: Well I saw Milton Friedman's name on the syllabus, so I though maybe he'd want it.
LOGAN: Hey!
RORY: What, what's that?
LOGAN: Bing Crosby and Gary Crosby.
RORY: Oh, no way!
LOGAN: It was in the wrong sleeve. He can croon with "Maggie Blues."
RORY: Oh, perfect.
LOGAN: Alright I'm gonna start loading this stuff in the car.
RORY: Okay. Logan?
LOGAN: Ace.
RORY: Thank you. Thank you so much for everything.
LOGAN: Of course. But you don't have to thank me. There's nowhere else I'd rather be.
HOSPITAL – GIFT SHOP
[Emily enters]
EMILY: There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Oh, yeah?
EMILY: I just got these faxed, and…
LORELAI: Oh mum please, can we drop this?
EMILY: I need to verify your social-security number.
LORELAI: I don't want to give you my social-security number right now. Why don't you help me pick out a little gift for dad.
EMILY: What do you think I'm trying to do, run a con, steal your identity?
LORELAI: No mum I've just had enough of talking about social securities and wills, okay?
EMILY: Your father's lawyer faxed these over from the bank, and I need your social-security number.
LORELAI: You have got to be kidding me.
EMILY: What would I be kidding about?
LORELAI: You're acting like dad is dead. Dad is not dead.
EMILY: Lorelai, six years ago, when your father was in the hospital, we were completely unprepared, and we agreed to never let that happen again. So we made a plan, and I am simply following through on the plan.
LORELAI: So your plan was to chat up Persephone's to make sure you don't lose your special table and to order tons of swordfish and salmon to keep your skin glowing and to happily discuss with Quentin whether or not dad should be resuscitated?
EMILY: These are things that need to be dealt with.
LORELAI: No what has to be dealt with is that dad could be dying. What you're dealing with is phone calls and a checklist. You're not his secretary. You're his wife.
EMILY: Yes and what do you know about being a wife? You've been married for what -- 40 days? That's nothing. Your father and I have been married for over 40 years. For 2/3 of my life, I have been the wife of Richard Gilmore. I run his household. I plan his meals. I buy his clothes, entertain his business associates. When he loses his reading glasses, I find them. When he wants a nightcap. I make it for him. If he can't remember the name of a colleague's wife, I whisper it in his ear. That's what I do -- I take care of him. That's my job. That's who I am. If I could be performing his surgery right now, I would be, but I can't -- it's out of my hands. [Voice breaking] It's out of my hands, and there's nothing I can do but wait. I could lose him, Lorelai. He's my whole life, and there's nothing I can do!
LORELAI: Mom.
EMILY: I'm sorry. This is inappropriate.
LORELAI: No, it's not. It's fine.
[Lorelai takes some tissues off the shelf and hands some to Emily]
EMILY: [Sniffles] Oh, god, I'm a mess. [Sniffles] Did you just take those?
LORELAI: Don't worry about it. Pay for it later.
EMILY: [Sighs]
HOSPITAL – WAITING ROOM
[Lorelai, Rory, Emily and Logan and sitting.]
EMILY: Just a few more?
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. [handing out some milk duds] They're good, right?
EMILY: They stick in your teeth. [eating one] But, yes, they are good. Are there any more?
LORELAI: Are you kidding? There's a ton.
EMILY: Not too many.
LORELAI: Oh mum there's no such thing.
EMILY: I wonder why they call them "duds."
LORELAI: I don't know. Do you guys know?
LOGAN: Nope.
RORY: I could make something up, but no.
EMILY: Seems a rather counterintuitive name for a type of candy.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: So, he's out of surgery, and it went extremely well. His recovery won't be immediate. He still has several days here at the hospital. But we can go over more of that later. He's groggy now and tired. After he gets some rest, you can all visit with him, but for now, maybe just his wife.
EMILY: Thank you, doctor.
LORELAI: Tell dad "Hi" from us, mom.
EMILY: I will, Lorelai. [hands back the duds]
HOSPITAL – RICHARDS ROOM
EMILY: Everything's in order, you'll be glad to know. I called Harold Larkin and the chairman of the economics department. They both send their best wishes for a speedy recovery. I canceled our dinner reservations for the next couple of weeks. Oh and I sent regrets to Sarah Osgood, who's hosting the D.A.R. Spring fling this year. I left word for the Sudburys that we won't be able to host bridge this week. [Chuckles] Uh, what else? Oh, and I've been in touch with Quentin. He's been kept abreast of the whole situation. And I bought fish, Richard, so much fish -- uh, Tuna and Trout and Snapper and Salmon and…
RICHARD: [Drowsily] Sounds just fine, Emily. That sounds just fine.
HOSPITAL – EXTERIOR
[Lorelai is on the phone]
LORELAI: [Sighs] Hi, it's me -- again. Um, dad's out of surgery, and it went well, and he's doing fine, so... it's good news. I just -- I wanted you to know... because... I don't know why. 'Cause you haven't returned any of my calls. But I just thought I would, uh, tell you what's going on because... I'm your wife and...I think that's what I'm supposed to do. No idea how to be your wife, but I'm trying. You're my husband, you know, and... it seems like you should be here or call me back. I mean, I'm pretty sure that's what married people do, is be there for each other. But I know you're upset, and I know we had a fight, but this is just bigger than that, you know? It's my dad, and he's had a heart attack. And everybody's been here. I mean, I've talked to Sookie and even Michel and Patty and Babette, and they've all been here for me, but... [Exhales sharply] My husband's...not here. That's not okay, Chris, you know? It's not okay.
[Lorelai ends the call and goes back inside]
HOSPITAL – RICHARDS ROOM
RORY: Here we go -- a little "Maggie Blues." ["Maggie blues" plays]
RICHARD: Ahh.
RORY: [Chuckles] That is Bing and Gary Crosby.
LORELAI: Bing, why doesn't anybody name their kid "Bing" anymore?
RORY: You could have named me "Bing."
LORELAI: I thought about it but you didn't look like a Bing.
RORY: I don't even know if I should be insulted.
RICHARD: I wish I were a crooner.
RORY: I also brought you some Gershwin, some Chuck Berry, and the Andrews Sisters. Ooh, and some Milton Friedman.
LORELAI: The guy who sang "Spirit in the Sky"?
RICHARD: No, that was Norman Greenbaum.
RORY: No, Milton Friedman's the economist who won the Nobel prize in the '70s. I figured when you're sick of reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, you can pick up Friedman for a real mystery and deduce the disadvantages of government intervention in economic policy.
LORELAI: So what do you say, dad -- here or Philadelphia? What's the call?
RICHARD: I don't think I'd like to be in Philadelphia. I think I'd rather be in New Haven.
LORELAI: Yeah, it's okay here. We can import cream cheese and cheesesteaks and any other kind of cheese. You look good, dad. This outfit's not really up to your usual J. Press standards, unless it's got some brass buttons I can't see, but...you look good. You look tall.
RICHARD: I think I'm just gonna... close my eyes for... just a little minute.
RORY: Is he asleep?
LORELAI: I think so. Should we draw a mustache on him?
RORY: He's already got a mustache.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. The music's nice.
RORY: Yeah, it is, isn't it?
LORELAI: Hey, Rory?
RORY: Hey, mom?
LORELAI: You know, I'm glad to see you doing so well with Logan. I'm happy that you're happy. Thanks. He's not half bad, that kid. He's almost okay.
RORY: Yeah, he's all right. [Chuckles] Hey, uh, mom?
LORELAI: Hey, uh, Rory?
RORY: Um, do you...know where dad is?
LORELAI: No, hon. For all I know, maybe he's in Philadelphia.
HOSPITAL – WAITING ROOM
[Dr Goldstein, Emily, Lorelai, Rory and Logan are walking to the waiting room]
DR. GOLDSTEIN: So we should be able to move him out of the C.I.C.U. In 24 hours. And if everything goes as planned, he should be home in five or six days.
EMILY: Everything will go as planned. I'm sure of it.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: now if you like I can show you the room where we'll be moving Richard tomorrow.
EMILY: Absolutely, does it have a window? The room he's in has a window so small, it's almost a peephole.
DR. GOLDSTEIN: I believe it does have a window.
LORELAI: [spotting Luke] Go ahead. I'll be right there.
RORY: Okay, mom.
LUKE: Make sure they get it, just be careful of this bag here, 'cause it's leaking a little bit.
LORELAI: Hey, you're back.
LUKE: Oh. Hey. I just I didn't want to bug you. I just wanted to drop off some food for you guys and get going.
LORELAI: Luke you didn't have to do that.
LUKE: No it's all right. Just I wanted to make some stuff anyway, so... all right, I'm gonna get out of here now.
LORELAI: He's okay. The surgery went well.
LUKE: Oh, that's terrific. That is such good news.
LORELAI: He's doing really well they think he'll be able to go home in a couple days.
LUKE: Oh, that's so good. Yeah. So, how's he looking?
LORELAI: Um...he looks good... big...tall.
LUKE: That's good. Yeah, he's tall. He's a big man. He is a big, tall man.
HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, excuse me.
NURSE: Can I help you?
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm looking for Richard Gilmore.
NURSE: And you are?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm his son-in-law.
NURSE: Okay he's in room B-10. It's just down the hall. Take a right at the nurses' station.
CHRISTOPHER: Is he, uh...
NURSE: the surgery went really well. He's resting comfortably, He's gonna be fine.
CHRISTOPHER: Okay good. Alright so down the hall, right?
NURSE: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.
HOSPITAL – WAITING ROOM
LUKE: Okay so look, I got a couple of burgers, assortment of sandwiches. There's some salads in case all of a sudden you want to eat some salad.
LORELAI: Mm hmm.
LUKE: All right, couple pieces of pie, half a dozen chocolate-chip cookies, and, of course, there is the fish bag.
LORELAI: You brought a fish bag?
LUKE: Well I heard somebody talking about fish. There's two fillets, okay, Lobster roll, fish tacos, two Tuna-fish sandwiches, some fried fish, and fish sticks.
LORELAI: [seeing Chris] Hi. You're here.
CHRISTOPHER: I'm here.
LUKE: All right, I'm gonna get going.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, you should.
[Chris and Luke share looks]
LUKE: I'm glad your dad's doing good.
[Luke leaves]
LORELAI: Why didn't you call me? I didn't think you were coming.
CHRISTOPHER: Clearly.
LORELAI: No, he just brought food. I didn't call him.
CHRISTOPHER: I don't want to talk about this here…
LORELAI: What…
CHRISTOPHER: Not now.
RORY: Dad. Hey.
EMILY: Christopher, I'm so glad you're here.
CHRISTOPHER: Of course, of course. I'm so glad to hear that Richard's okay. How you doing, kiddo?
RORY: I'm okay. I think we're gonna go visit grandpa again. Do you want to come? I'm sure he'd be happy to see you.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah that'd be great.
RORY: Okay, come on.
EMILY: It'll be all right. Every cloud has a silver lining.
LORELAI: Thanks, mom.
EMILY: Well, blood is thicker than water.
LORELAI: Hmm.
[Lorelai looks at the bags of food Luke left]

HOSPITAL - HALLWAY
[Richard is walking with Lorelai, Rory and Emily down the hall.]
LORELAI: You're looking good, dad. I'd say you shaved a few minutes off your last lap. If I had to guess, I'd think you're clocking in at about a 45-minute mile, which puts you just behind Mrs. Abalone.
EMILY: Lorelai, really.
RICHARD: I think that's an unfair comParison. Mrs. Abalone had her bypass two whole days before mine.
LORELAI: No, no, no excuses. Your just gonna have to dig a little deeper.
RORY: Come on grandpa, just visualize Mrs. Abalone eating your dust.
EMILY: Rory, honestly.
RICHARD: No, it's all right. [Richard walks faster] How's this?
LORELAI: Wow, I would say we have a new slow-walk leader in the cardiac-recovery wing. Hey, do you hear that? [makes a sound]
RORY: What, the crowd cheering?
LORELAI: Whoo!
RORY: Yeah, grandpa!
EMILY: Would you two stop? You're making a scene.
LORELAI: [using here hand as microphone] Mr. Gilmore, congratulations on your recent victory. Any opinions about the allegations of steroid use among your fellow athletes?
RICHARD: Well I consider myself proof positive that it can be done... and done clean.
EMILY: Richard, must you encourage them?
RORY: Well excuse me, Emily. I'm getting a little stir crazy in this place.
EMILY: Well you'll be getting out of here soon enough. Oh, I forgot to tell you -- Kate and Daniel Urman called to send their regards.
RORY: Oh, hey, Mr. Gavelle.
LORELAI: Looking good, Ira.
EMILY: Well they sent a lovely floral arrangement to the house. Although personally I find white roses a little uninspiring. I think my favorite arrangement is still the one that Christopher sent. It was very tasteful and appropriate and so colorful. I mean, we're not in mourning, for heaven's sake. I'm getting very tired of white flowers. You thanked him for us?
LORELAI: Uh, yeah. Hey, so you know that young guy who's been visiting Miss Santiago in room 236? Not her son. Her boyfriend.
RORY: No!
LORELAI: Yes.
RICHARD: Girls, I don't think that's any of our business.
EMILY: But he's at least 20 years younger than she is. 32 according to the night nurse.
RORY: 32?
EMILY: He's just a boy. What could they possibly have to talk about?
LORELAI: I don't think they're doing a whole lot of talking, if you know what I mean.
EMILY: I most certainly do not know what you mean.
RICHARD: All right, that's enough. Rory, when are you heading back to Yale?
LORELAI: Oh yeah you should hit the road, huh?
RICHARD: Yeah, now remember, you owe me a full report on the T.A. That's taking over my spot. The whole semester should concentrate on microeconomics, so if this Culbertson fellow even mentions Ben Bernanke, give me a call.
RORY: I promise I will. But actually I was thinking maybe I'd hang out here with you guys a little longer and go back next week.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Don't be silly, Rory.
RICHARD: You're going back today.
RORY: I've only missed two days.
LORELAI: Two days? That's plenty.
RORY: But it's just the beginning of school. It doesn't matter. It's not a big deal.
LORELAI: It is a very big deal. Plus, we already decided.
RORY: Well yeah gut haven't you ever decided something and then changed your mind?
[Lorelai and Rory hand back]
LORELAI: [Just to Rory] Honey, listen, everything is gonna be fine. Grandpa's doing great. There's no reason for you to stay.
RORY: Well what if he needs something?
LORELAI: Grandma has got this place wired. She's already slipped the nurses something to keep the ice chips coming. Really, he's fine.
RORY: Okay well what about you?
LORELAI: What about me?
RORY: Well I don't want you to have to go home alone.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm fine.
RORY: Yeah but dad hasn't been home.
LORELAI: Well, he's with Gigi At his mom's.
RORY: Okay, but for how long?
LORELAI: I don't know, honey. He just said he needed some time.
RORY: How much time?
LORELAI: He didn't say. L-look, I've had my hands full here, so I really didn't want to get into it over the phone.
RORY: Well do you want me to call him and just see what's going on?
LORELAI: Absolutely not.
RORY: Well, what is his problem? I mean it was just a character reference.
LORELAI: Hey, don't worry about it. It's between me and your dad. And we're gonna work it out, okay?
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: "Okay" like you're gonna go back to school like our original deal?
RORY: I will go back to school. However, for future reference, the next time we have a conversation where I say, "maybe Friday," that does not mean that we have struck a deal.
LORELAI: See I remember you saying "absolutely, definitely, positively Friday."
RORY: Oh, so it's you know, your word against mine?
LORELAI: It's a classic case of she said, she said.
RORY: Hmm.
LORELAI: Hi, Mrs. Santiago.
RORY: Her boyfriend, really?
LORELAI: She's got a nice butt.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: What? It's the hospital gowns. Believe me. I wish I did not know that.
OPENING CREDITS
DRAGONFLY INN – INTERIOR
[Lorelai enters the front door]
MALE STAFF: You're back.
LORELAI: I'm back, thanks for the call.
CHRISTY: Hey, how's your dad?
LORELAI: Oh he's great, thanks. How was the Wilson wedding?
I can't believe she added
15 people at the last minute.
CHRISTY: I know right it took us an hour to get the extra rooms ready, but we sent welcome baskets up like you said, and everyone seemed fine.
LORELAI: Even the mother-in-law?
CHRISTY: She was awful.
LORELAI: She's a beast.
[Lorelai enters the kitchen]
LORELAI: Hey!
SOOKIE: There she is!
LORELAI: yeah.
SOOKIE: So?
LORELAI: Well, he made his nurse go get him a wall street journal this morning.
SOOKIE: That's good! That's a good sign!
LORELAI: Yeah, he's doing better. And hey thanks for the cookies. They were a big hit.
SOOKIE: Oh, good. [Giggles] With these cravings, all I feel like cooking is chili with cayenne pepper and extra onions, but I didn't think chili with cayenne peppers and extra onions, cookies would go over well with your parents.
LORELAI: Well tell them it's exotic and expensive, and they'll love it.
SOOKIE: The little one has a spicy palate, huh? Yeah, except for the cauliflower thing. He or she has got a huge cauliflower thing.
LORELAI: Also not a good cookie. [Too Michel] Oh, hi.
MICHEL: Hello, Lorelai. Welcome back.
LORELAI: Thanks. What's with the dog?
SOOKIE: Yeah why is that here?
MICHEL: I assume you're talking about Paw-Paw.
SOOKIE: I'm talking about the furry thing that you know you're not supposed to bring to work due to the fact that many of our guests do not enjoy finding dog hairs in their Lobster bisque.
MICHEL: I had no choice but to bring him in today. Paw-Paw could not be left alone. His brother Chin-Chin passed away last night.
LORELAI: Michel, I'm so sorry.
MICHEL: Paw-Paw is beside himself.
SOOKIE: I'm really sorry, Michel.
MICHEL: You didn't even like him.
SOOKIE: Sure, I did. That little guy!
MICHEL: You called him a walking flea circus.
LORELAI: Yeah. Chin-Chin was a wonderful dog, Michel.
MICHEL: Thank you.
SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah. Remember at the labor day picnic, I dropped my sandwich, and I was like, "oh, great, now I've got to clean this all up." And Chin-Chin just came in and scooped it up, and saved me that trip.
MICHEL: That was Paw-Paw.
SOOKIE: What? No!
MICHEL: [getting angry] I was standing right there. That was Paw-Paw who ate your sandwich. Chin-Chin didn't even like barbecue.
SOOKIE: Oh, well, still.
MICHEL: [more angry] Still what?! Are your two stinky little children interchangeable?
SOOKIE: [now angry also] Hey! Excuse me!
LORELAI: What Sookie means to say and what I mean to say is we're very sorry for your loss.
MICHEL: Thank you, Lorelai. He was always such a sweet little dog. What a personality. So warm.
LORELAI: Warm. Yes. And, um, fuzzy and...
MICHEL: I just can't believe he's gone. It doesn't feel real. I miss him so much.
LORELAI: Well, you should have a memorial or something.
SOOKIE: Yeah, that's a good idea.
MICHEL: Oh. I suppose it is.
LORELAI: Yeah it'll give you and Paw-Paw a chance to say goodbye.
MICHEL: That might be nice. Could you do it by tomorrow?
LORELAI: Me? What?
MICHEL: If you're going to put together a memorial, it should be soon.
LORELAI: Uh...yeah, sure. Tomorrow would be fine.
MICHEL: All right, that sounds fine. Well, I guess I should get started on the guest list. There are so many people who will want to pay their respects. Paw-Paw, come on.
[Michel leaves, Lorelai and Sookie go to the front desk]
LORELAI: Any objections to holding a chow funeral, speak now, although it's already too late.
SOOKIE: Oh it's a nice idea, though. He was so upset.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: I could have sworn the sandwich dog was Chin-Chin.
LORELAI: It was hard to tell the difference between them. They were both so…
SOOKIE: Aloof.
LORELAI: I was gonna say obnoxious.
SOOKIE: Well that too.
LORELAI: I think Chin-Chin was the one who was aloof, obnoxious, and a biter.
SOOKIE: That's right.
LORELAI: Yeah.
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Rory comes home, Paris still has the whiteboards everywhere.]
PARIS: Oh, good. You're back.
RORY: Yeah, I'm back.
PARIS: I went to the Sigma Chi party without you. I was going to wait, but I didn't know when you'd be back, so I decided to just go ahead and do it.
RORY: Well, that's fine, Paris.
PARIS: I know it's fine. It was on the schedule. What was I supposed to do, stop my life because you were gone?
RORY: Ah no, but I'm glad that you went. Um, that's great. How was it?
PARIS: Asinine. You didn't miss anything. Here, I wrote a summary. And here's your mail. I flagged your bills.
RORY: Oh, thanks, Paris.
PARIS: So, how are you?
RORY: Oh, I'm okay.
PARIS: And Richard?
RORY: Oh he's really good. They're gonna keep him for another night, then he should be able to go home.
PARIS: It was a myocardial infarction?
RORY: Yeah, a heart attack.
PARIS: Is he going on beta blockers?
RORY: I don't know.
PARIS: If he can tolerate them, he should. They reduce the risk of death following a heart attack by about 25%. Of course he'll have to implement a few lifestyle changes, but you tell him if Bill Clinton can give up cheese fries and pork grits, he can get by without his 5:00 martini.
RORY: I will pass that along.
PARIS: Good. Anyway, I'm glad he's okay.
RORY: Yeah, me too. That was scary.
PARIS: I'll bet. [pause] So, I downloaded your reading lists, and I went to the bookstore and hid copies of your books so you wouldn't get stuck buying used ones with some idiot's comments in the margins. And here, I made you a copy of the notes from our "history of feminism" seminar since you missed the first class.
RORY: Oh, thanks, Paris. What's with the blacked-out section?
PARIS: Well I'm happy to share the things the teacher said to the general public, but I'm not about to share my insights into the material.
RORY: Mmm.
PARIS: Don't give me that look. If there's one thing I learned in that lecture it's there's not room for many women at the top.
RORY: Gloria Steinem would be so proud.
PARIS: Whatever. The facts speak for themselves. Nadine Strossen is the head of the ACLU, not Nadine Strossen and her very best friend. Oh, we're supposed to choose a paper topic by Friday, but I'm sure you can swing an extension if you play the grandfather card.
RORY: I will have a topic picked. I don't need to play the grandfather card because my grandfather is fine.
PARIS: Okay. So, are you ready to trade?
RORY: Trade what?
PARIS: Résumés. It's on the schedule. We're supposed to trade résumés today and get back to each other by tomorrow morning with questions or comments.
RORY: I forgot. I've been at the hospital for two days.
PARIS: So much for not playing the grandfather card.
RORY: No, there's no card. I just mean that I haven't gotten around to it. I will get you my résumé by tomorrow.
PARIS: Fine. By "résumé" you mean "résumés," right?
RORY: How many do we need?
PARIS: I have 21 versions, each one tailored to a particular job in a particular field -- grad school, law school, med school, fellowships, jobs on newspapers, jobs on the business side of newspapers, jobs working for multimedia conglomerations, jobs working for quote unquote "the little guy," jobs in the public sector, I.E. Internships in Washington, for which there are three different versions based on whether or not I'm applying to work for a democrat, a republican, or a Joe Lieberman.
RORY: Wow. [Sees a box on the counter] When did this get here?
PARIS: Yesterday. Anyway, like I was saying it's important to tailor your résumés to your potential employers. You think Harvard law school is looking for the same k*ll set as NASA?
RORY: [Starts opening the box] Probably not. Funnily enough, neither Harvard law school nor NASA are on my list. So, I'll get you my résumés tonight. Oh, look, it's from Logan -- second-semester senior survival kit. There's a datebook and a stress ball, a magnetic poetry kit, bags and bags of coffee beans, something called an inspirational marble keepsake with the words "anything's possible" engraved on it. Don't worry. I'll keep it in my room.
PARIS: Oh! This is a beer funnel. I saw one at the party last night.
[Rory picks up the phone and using speed dial makes a call]
RORY: Logan, thank you.
[Logan's in a coffee shop in New York City]
LOGAN: You got the package?
RORY: Yeah, finally someone gave me an inspirational keepsake.
LOGAN: Are you inspired? Next year, baby, anything's possible.
RORY: Yeah, I know I hear you loud and clear and heavy.
LOGAN: Good, because the world is your oyster, to quote the other inspirational keepsake I was considering. How's it being back? How you doing you doing okay?
RORY: Yeah, I'm fine.
LOGAN: Because if you want me to come up tonight...
RORY: Oh no, I'll see you on Sunday.
LOGAN: Okay, but if you change your mind...
RORY: You'll be here. Logan, I cannot thank you enough. You've just been really great throughout this whole thing.
LOGAN: No way you don't get to thank me for that. It comes with the territory. Hey Rory, my 10:00 coffee just showed.
RORY: Go. I've got a 10:00 cereal waiting for me.
LOGAN: I'll call you later?
RORY: Sounds good.
LOGAN: I love you.
RORY: You, too. [ends the call]
PARIS: What's with the gooney look?
RORY: Hmm?
PARIS: Your face. It's right out of a harlequin romance.
RORY: He's just been so great. I mean he's really been there for me for the past couple days. I had to practically send him away from the hospital yesterday.
PARIS: I know. It's amazing. I never thought you guys were gonna last.
RORY: What?
PARIS: I'm just being honest. I mean Logan Huntzberger? Between the women and the drinking, that kid was on the Colin Farrell freeway about to pull over into the Robert Downey jr. Rest stop.
RORY: I get it, Paris.
PARIS: What I'm trying to say is, he's changed. You changed him. It's amazing. I'm rarely this wrong.
RORY: Well, thanks.
PARIS: Don't get me wrong. Doyle was quite the ladies' man, as well. Now, he's down for the count. The other night, he wanted to play "let's think up baby names" in bed.
RORY: Really?
PARIS: Yeah. I mean, let's face it. We took two wild stallions, and we broke them.
RORY: I don't think I really "broke" Logan.
PARIS: Oh, you broke him. You broke him hard. You can open the gate, and he's not going to bolt. You can kick him with a spur, and he's not going to spook. You own him.
RORY: Paris, stop. That's ridiculous. I think I'm gonna go work on my résumés.
PARIS: Hey, let's make them go out and get tattoos. It'll be like we branded them.
DRAGONFLY INN – FRONT DESK
[Lorelai is helping some customers. Michel is waiting off to the side.]
MR. CANNOLD: It says here "12% sales tax." And that is?
LORELAI: The percentage of sales tax Connecticut mandates. I know. It's outrageous.
MRS. CANNOLD: Harold, I've already paid the bill.
MR. CANNOLD: And this is the room rate.
LORELAI: Times three nights. Yep.
MR. CANNOLD: Okay, and what is this charge for, exactly, under room service?
LORELAI: That's...for the room service that you ordered. Would you like to see an itemized copy?
MRS. CANNOLD: No.
MR. CANNOLD: Yes.
MRS. CANNOLD: That's it. I'm leaving. Thank you for your patience.
LORELAI: No problem.
MRS. CANNOLD: Are you coming?
MR. CANNOLD: Yeah.
LORELAI: Thank you. Bye.
MICHEL: So, are you ready to talk?
LORELAI: Oh, sure.
MICHEL: Let's go to the library.
LORELAI: Okay.
DRAGONFLY INN - LIBRARY
[Sookie is waiting]
MICHEL: Please sit down. [They all sit down, Michel has a large folder.] Okay, I'm ready to hear your ideas for the funeral.
[Lorelai and Sookie clearly have nothing ready]
LORELAI: Okay. Um...gosh, our ideas. Well, we've got so many ideas.
SOOKIE: So, so many. Why don't you start with, uh, the ideas?
LORELAI: Okay. Um, well, first of all, we thought we'd put him in a box.
MICHEL: A box?
LORELAI: A bag?
MICHEL: A bag?
LORELAI: Sorry animal disposal is not my area of expertise.
MICHEL: Chin-Chin has been cremated at the animal hospital. After the memorial, his ashes will be scattered under the poplar tree behind my house where he so often went to think.
LORELAI: Oh, okay. Cool.
SOOKIE: A tree. That's nice.
MICHEL: Why don't you just talk me through the particulars of the event?
LORELAI: Right. Okay. Um, well, we, uh, thought we would have it here.
MICHEL: That sounds good.
LORELAI: Okay. During lunch.
MICHEL: During lunch?
LORELAI: Or before lunch.
SOOKIE: Or after lunch.
LORELAI: Either way. Before or after lunch it doesn't matter.
MICHEL: Why must it relate to lunch at all?
LORELAI: No it doesn't have to. We were just using lunch as a measure of time.
SOOKIE: A way to break up the day.
LORELAI: Yes totally arbitrary.
MICHEL: I was thinking twilight might be nice.
LORELAI: Great. Well, then 5:00 it is. That's a wonderful... idea. Sookie, what else was on our list? Do you have yours with you?
SOOKIE: No I don't. Sorry. I left mine with yours, so...
MICHEL: The flowers.
LORELAI: Oh!
SOOKIE: Oh that was the first thing on our list.
LORELAI: There will definitely be flowers.
MICHEL: I was thinking Gerber Daisies would be nice, maybe in red, yellows, oranges to complement his fur.
LORELAI: Done and done.
MICHEL: Can I trust you to liaise with the florist?
LORELAI: I'll liaise with the florist.
MICHEL: Let's discuss the programs.
LORELAI: The programs.
SOOKIE: You want programs?
MICHEL: Do you think when the Princess of Wales was interred at Althorp the Spencer family was asked whether or not they wanted programs?
LORELAI: Probably not.
MICHEL: I assume there are no stationery selections for me to choose from yet.
LORELAI: Not yet.
MICHEL: You know what who cares? Why don't we just use fax paper? And hey why not print them out on the computer? After all, it's just a dog.
LORELAI: Hey, Michel, don't worry about the programs, okay? We'll make up something really nice for you.
MICHEL: Fine. Here's the picture I'd like to use for the cover.
LORELAI: Aw, well, isn't that cute?
SOOKIE: [Chuckling] Oh, yeah. Cute.
MICHEL: Shall we go over the menus?
LORELAI: Ah, the menus. Well, Sookie, take it away.
[Lorelai gets up to leave but Sookie stops her]
SOOKIE: Oh! Hey. Stay. I'd love your input.
LORELAI: You've always let me know that when it comes to food, you're the boss. Well, you're the boss.
[Lorelai breaks free and leaves in a rush]
DRAGONFLY INN - DINNING ROOM
[Lorelai leaves the library]
CHRISTOPHER: Hi.
LORELAI: Hi.
CHRISTOPHER: I guess we should talk.
LORELAI: I guess we should.
MICHEL: [Heard from the library] Crudités?
LORELAI: Not here. Come on.
MICHEL: [Heard from the library] If your child died, would you serve crudités?
SOOKIE: Hey, can my children not be your go-to?!
DRAGONFLY INN – ROOM 4
[Chris and Lorelai enter]
LORELAI: Okay, go. Talk.
CHRISTOPHER: Well, obviously we have some issues.
LORELAI: Issues? What issues? We got in a fight and you took off.
CHRISTOPHER: I was mad.
LORELAI: Oh you were mad. Then never mind. You should have left.
CHRISTOPHER: Don't be sarcastic.
LORELAI: Don't tell me what to do, not when I wake up after we have a fight and you've disappeared.
CHRISTOPHER: I needed some space.
LORELAI: Oh, you needed space? We're married. You need space, you walk around the block, you go get a beer. You don't take off. My father was in the hospital. You weren't there.
CHRISTOPHER:I turned my phone off after the fight. I was upset. I came as soon as I heard.
LORELAI: You came and then you stayed for an hour and then you left again.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I didn't feel like staying much when I saw who else was there.
LORELAI: I didn't ask Luke to come.
CHRISTOPHER: Well you didn't ask him to leave, either.
LORELAI: No, I didn't. He's my friend. He brought food. You weren't there!
CHRISTOPHER: I was there. I saw your dad. I checked in.
LORELAI: "Checked in." I'm not the 6:40 to buffalo.
CHRISTOPHER: Look I'm sorry. I'm sick of seeing that guy.
LORELAI: Well how do you think I feel? I mean for two days I'm in that hospital 18 hours a day. I didn't even know if you were coming back.
CHRISTOPHER: I needed time.
LORELAI: I needed you.
CHRISTOPHER: Lor.
LORELAI: You know what the worst part of it was? When you weren't there, part of me wasn't surprised.
CHRISTOPHER: That's not fair.
LORELAI: I can't do this now. I have a million things to get done. I just -- I can't.
CHRISTOPHER: So, when?
LORELAI: I don't know. Later.
[Lorelai leaves Chris standing there alone.]
DRAGONFLY INN – FRONT DESK
[Lorelai is on the phone and computers when her cell phone rings]
LORELAI: Okay uh, well, then, you're all set for the 16th. [answers the cell phone] Hang on.
RORY: [At Yale] Hanging.
LORELAI: Yes, sir. Well, that's wonderful. We're looking forward to it. Thank you. Okay, bye. [hangs up phone and continues with Rory] Hi, hon.
RORY: Quick, get me into a microeconomic mood.
LORELAI: Uh, okay. Uh supply and demand, profit margin, pork bellies.
RORY: You had me till pork bellies.
LORELAI: You're going to grandpa's class sans grandpa?
RORY: Yes, and I'm kind of dreading it. I mean I only signed up for this class because grandpa was teaching it. I'm not naturally econ crazy.
LORELAI: Is anyone really econ crazy?
RORY: Oh, yeah. First thing I learned last semester, people find the gross national product endlessly fascinating.
LORELAI: Weird.
RORY: Blew my mind. So, how's your re-immersion going?
LORELAI: Pretty good, loving the non-fluorescent lighting, although I kinda miss eating my meals out of a vending machine. How are you doing?
RORY: Not bad. Logan got me a marble plaque, and Paris hid books. It was sweet.
LORELAI: All right, must be a generational thing.
RORY: Must be, oh, any word from dad? [Too a vendor] Latte, please.
LORELAI: Um...yes, actually. He just came by the inn.
RORY: He did?
LORELAI: A couple hours ago.
RORY: What did he say?
LORELAI: Oh, you know, he said he's been needing some space.
RORY: That's ridiculous. He hasn't been home in two days.
LORELAI: Well he was upset about the letter, then he saw Luke at the hospital, you know?
RORY: Well so what if he saw Luke at the hospital? He should have been there for you.
LORELAI: He was. He came.
RORY: Yeah, but then he left.
LORELAI: Honey, look, don't be mad at your dad, okay? It's a complicated situation.
RORY: Mom, stop it. I'm not Switzerland.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I'm on your side.
LORELAI: I don't want you to take sides.
RORY: Look, I'm not a kid anymore, okay? I get to have an opinion, and I get to pick a side. And I'm on your side, like it or not.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: And it's not just because you're right and he's wrong. I'm on your side, no matter what.
LORELAI: No matter what? I mean, even if I cut off all your hair while you were sleeping, would you still be on my side then?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: What if I signed you up for a camping trip and made you go?
RORY: Even then.
LORELAI: What if I put a secret clause on your birth certificate that says when you turn 23, your name changes to Hildegarde?
RORY: There's no such thing as a birth-certificate clause.
LORELAI: I had a really good lawyer.
RORY: Even then.
LORELAI: Oh, good to know.
RORY: So, talk to me. How are you feeling?
LORELAI: Oh, good. Fine. Medium. You know, rare -- medium rare. Rare. More like sashimi.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: It's scary, you know? Your dad, um... tends to... avoid conflict when things get complicated.
RORY: Did you tell him that? You should tell him that.
LORELAI: I did. I mean, I tried. I was mad. I told him we'd talk later.
RORY: Well, you can call me after you talk to him. I mean I'm sure you guys will work everything out, but you can call me if you need anything.
LORELAI: Yeah. I got you on speed dial.
RORY: Really you programmed your speed dial?
LORELAI: No. It's metaphorically speaking. I can dial really fast, though.
RORY: Got you. I'm gonna run into class.
LORELAI: Okay, hon. Sounds good.
RORY: Okay, peace out, yo.
LORELAI: Bye, Hilde.



YALE – CLASSROOM
[Busy with students getting ready for class]
MALE STUDENT: Hey, Rory.
RORY: Hey.
MALE STUDENT: Good to see you.
TUCKER: Rory Gilmore? Heard your name. Just want to introduce myself. Tucker Culbertson, filling in for your grandfather until he's well enough to come back.
[Rory is flustered]
RORY: Oh. Well, hello, Professor Culbertson.
TUCKER: Thanks for the promotion. I'm not a professor yet. I'm just a T.A.
RORY: Oh. Uh, sorry -- not that you're a T.A., Just that I called you -- um, I'm Rory.
TUCKER: I know.
RORY: Right. [Chuckles]
TUCKER: So, how's he doing?
RORY: Great. Thanks.
TUCKER: I'm glad. I heard he's a terrific lecturer.
RORY: Oh, yeah, the best -- well, in my entirely biased opinion.
TUCKER: I'm with you. I can't believe this is his first year of teaching. He really put together a great syllabus. I'm looking forward to getting into it.
RORY: Me too.
TUCKER: Well, it's nice to meet you, Rory.
RORY: Yeah, well, good luck. Oh, I mean, not that you need it or anything. Okay, bye.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Chris is watching basketball on the new TV as Lorelai comes home.]
ANNOUNCER ON TV: Kentucky's being overconfident against this Alabama team. This is a team that is second in the history of the SCC in wins.
LORELAI: Hey.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey.
LORELAI: Sorry I'm late. It was busy at work.
CHRISTOPHER: That's okay. I hope you don't mind. I saw you were using three of them, so I thought I'd program your universal remote.
LORELAI: Thanks. Want some coffee?
CHRISTOPHER: No, I'm okay... unless you want some. [Turns off the TV]
LORELAI: No, I'm okay.
CHRISTOPHER: So, uh...
LORELAI: So, uh...
CHRISTOPHER: I've been thinking about things, and you're right. I shouldn't have taken off.
LORELAI: No, you shouldn't have. But you got to understand, Lor, that letter --
LORELAI: ugh. "Character reference."
CHRISTOPHER: Whatever.
LORELAI: No, not whatever. There's a big difference between a letter and a character reference. I had to write that stuff for Luke for a judge so he could get custody of his kid.
CHRISTOPHER: Don't do that.
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: Make me think this is all in my head.
LORELAI: It is!
CHRISTOPHER: It's not! I see the way you look at him.
LORELAI: Stop. I chose you. I married you.
CHRISTOPHER: It's not that simple.
LORELAI: What else is there?
CHRISTOPHER: Stuff! There's other stuff.
LORELAI: Like what?
CHRISTOPHER: I got into a fight with the guy, Lor.
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: About a month ago at the gazebo, I just walked up to him. We started whaling on each other.
LORELAI: Why wouldn't you tell me that?
CHRISTOPHER: Well it's not something I'm exactly proud of. I mean this is what it's come to -- I'm fighting the guy in the street.
LORELAI: I don't, Isn't that the kind of thing you would tell a person? I mean, I could help. I could have been more sensitive.
CHRISTOPHER: It's not just about the fight, Lor. I should have given you more time. You asked me to. I said I would. I didn't.
LORELAI: No, Chris.
CHRISTOPHER: You were vulnerable, and I pushed you. And I think it's because we always had this timing issue. You know we were too young, and then Sherry got pregnant. You were with him and -- I don't know. I saw this opportunity, and I thought, "now, we should do this now while we have the chance, while you're free and clear." But you weren't. You're not.
LORELAI: Yes, I am!
CHRISTOPHER: You were engaged to him, Lor. You needed time to -- to disengage.
LORELAI: Stop. That's not what this is. We're together now. Maybe we did rush into it, but we can, we can work this out.
CHRISTOPHER: I don't think we can.
LORELAI: What does that mean? You're giving up?
CHRISTOPHER: I don't know what else to do.
LORELAI: There's lots else to do. We can work on this.
CHRISTOPHER: Work on what, work on you thinking that I'm the man you want to spend the rest of your life with? I've been asking you to marry me for 20 years. We're finally married. I still feel like I'm asking you.
LORELAI: That's terrible. I'm sorry if you feel that way, if I made you feel that way. That's not how I feel. I'm in this.
CHRISTOPHER: I want to believe that.
LORELAI: You should. It's true.
CHRISTOPHER: Look, I should probably get back to my mom's. Gigi's been there all day, so.
LORELAI: Yeah, you should be with her. How is she?
CHRISTOPHER: She's fine. She's good.
LORELAI: So, we'll talk more tomorrow?
CHRISTOPHER: Okay. Yeah.
DRAGONFLY INN
[staring in the dinning room but moving to the front desk, Michel is upset and gets mad as the scene goes on.]
MICHEL: Lorelai, I specifically sent out a memo asking that all pillows featuring cats be removed from this library.
LORELAI: What?
MICHEL: The cat pillows -- they're still there!
LORELAI: Oh yeah I'll take care of it, I promise.
MICHEL: And you have to talk to Sookie.
LORELAI: What about?
MICHEL: I asked her about the final menu. She said she didn't have it yet. I said, "when can I expect it?" She said she wasn't sure. I said, "might I ask what you are planning?" And she said -- and I quote -- "let's see what's left over at the end of the day, and I'll whip up something delicious." Leftovers! Why even bother?
LORELAI: Oh Michel.
MICHEL: Is it too much to ask that the passing of my beloved dog be marked by food that has been prepared specifically with that occasion in mind?
LORELAI: I'm sure the food will be wonderful.
MICHEL: Well have you called about the flowers?
LORELAI: Ah I was just about to.
MICHEL: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Grayson's only needs a 2-hour heads up.
MICHEL: Well at least do you have a program for me to approve?
LORELAI: Uh, not yet, but I will.
MICHEL: The funeral is tonight.
LORELAI: I'm aware of that.
MICHEL: Then why has nothing been done?
LORELAI: Plenty has been done.
MICHEL: No! Nothing has been done. You are putting no effort into…
LORELAI: Michel, back off. I happen to have a few other things on my mind right now, so forgive me if I haven't put all of my energy into focusing on your dog funeral.
MICHEL: [still upset] I apologize that my loss has come at an inopportune time for you. I will try to schedule the next death when it is more convenient.
YALE – BOOK SHOP
PARIS: Let's see -- "Gender Trouble," Judith Butler. It should be here.
RORY: Are you sure this is where you hid it?
PARIS: Of course. I had an aunt Judy who loved to travel, hence the travel section. Then I used my standard covert alphabetizing system using the third letter of the author's last name, "T", followed by the third letter of the author's first name, "D." So it should be right here, after Tabin but before Thoreau. I don't understand why it's not here.
RORY: Okay I'm gonna go check the women's studies section again, see if I can find a used copy, just in case. Wait a minute. This whole shelf is a mess. Why is Congwen Shen before Tony Griffiths? [To a sales person near by] Excuse me. You. Come over here and explain yourself.
[Rory is looking for the book]
TUCKER: Rory.
RORY: Oh. Hey.
TUCKER: How you doing?
RORY: Good, thanks.
TUCKER: I'm glad. Ah I wanted to thank you. Seems you gave me a pretty good evaluation.
RORY: What?
TUCKER: I got a call from your grandfather. I think he was talking about class, unless you happened to see the econ grad students take out the comp. Lit grad students in ultimate Frisbee.
RORY: Oh, right. I'm sorry. I'm a little all over the place. New semester, you know.
TUCKER: Well I just wanted to thank you. It's always nice to get good feedback.
RORY: No problem.
TUCKER: See you around.
RORY: Okay. [short pause as Rory watches Tucker walk away.] That -- that's a good book.
TUCKER: Which one?
RORY: Um, "Eva Luna." Everyone loves "House of the Spirits," but I just think "Eva Luna" is Allende's best work.
TUCKER: Cool, I'm looking forward to reading it.
RORY: Yeah, me too. Oh, for you to read it. I'll see you around.
TUCKER: Bye, Rory.
[Paris comes rushing up]
PARIS: Where were you? The women's studies section is over there.
RORY: Um, yeah, I was on my way.
PARIS: The book's gone. Apparently they redid the travel section and alphabetized it according to destination instead of author. I ripped the salesman a new one, but it was too late. Hey. What's wrong with you?
RORY: What?
PARIS: You're all red and blotchy.
RORY: Oh, am I? It's probably just 'cause I'm a bit warm in here. So you found it?
PARIS: No. Weren't you listening? Here. It's used, but luckily, the previous owner was a dimwit slacker who only made it through chapter one.
RORY: Oh, great. That's good.
DRAGONFLY INN – DINNING ROOM
[People are moving things around]
KIRK: Flower delivery.
LORELAI: Oh. Kirk? Oh, I didn't know you worked for Grayson's.
KIRK: Oh, no, I don't work there. I'm volunteering.
LORELAI: How...noble.
KIRK: Yeah, I just thought it was time to give something back. Here's your bill. It's a little high because we had to do a little airbrushing. Small blemish on the nose. Probably wasn't visible to the naked eye, but when we blew the picture up -- wow.
LORELAI: Sounds great. I got a bunch of stuff to take care of. Bring the rest of the flowers in?
KIRK: Sure thing. [Clears throat] I don't want to embarrass you, but it is customary to tip the deliveryman.
LORELAI: I thought you were volunteering.
KIRK: Not for you.
LORELAI: Ask Rob at the front desk. He's got the petty cash. Ooo Hey, Christy, will we see you tonight at the memorial?
CHRISTY: Actually, I don't think…
LORELAI: Let me rephrase that. We'll see you tonight at the memorial. Attendance is mandatory. Thanks.
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
LORELAI: How's the food coming?
SOOKIE: Hey! I've got a Walnut Arugula Gorgonzola Crostini, a little Caraway Cornbread with apricots, bacon, and a little Jalapeno jam, Beef Tenderloin Chiffonade in little Focaccia rounds, and -- oh! -- Sweet potato biscuits with pork Tenderloin and a little Apple Chutney.
LORELAI: Wow.
SOOKIE: Yeah some of my finest work all wasted on a dog funeral and a petty little man.
LORELAI: Well, he said some things he didn't mean.
SOOKIE: You don't go after someone's children.
LORELAI: He's going through a very rough time, and he really will appreciate all of this.
SOOKIE: I know. I made him some fat-free brownies, too.
LORELAI: Aw.
SOOKIE: I know. I'm a softy.
LORELAI: And the whole kitchen staff's gonna be there, right?
SOOKIE: Those who value their jobs will be. I pulled out my "don't mess with me" face, which I use on the kids all the time. I'll be damned if they don't hop to and brush those teeth.
LORELAI: Good, I want a full house, and if they have minty-fresh breath, that's just a plus.
SOOKIE: They'll be there -- not that Michel will say thank you or modify his behavior in any way to show that he's grateful. But just so you know, you're doing a really nice thing.
LORELAI: Well, thanks. I feel bad about snapping at him.
SOOKIE: You have a lot on your mind. Want a brownie?
LORELAI: Mm, no, thanks. Um, so, I talked to Christopher.
SOOKIE: Wait. [To the kitchen staff] Get out. You're doing a great job, though!
LORELAI: Thanks.
SOOKIE: Keep it up.
LORELAI: Sorry.
SOOKIE: Go.
LORELAI: I talked to Christopher. I was really mad.
SOOKIE: But you were able to work it out.
LORELAI: Well we're working on working it out. He thinks that I don't want to be in it, he thinks that I don't even want to be in this marriage.
SOOKIE: But you do, right?
LORELAI: Of course I do.
SOOKIE: Yeah that's what I thought.
LORELAI: It's this Luke thing. Christopher's jealousy is blinding him, and I've been racking my brain to think of a way to convince him that I want to be in this marriage. And I think the only way is if I cut Luke out of my life entirely.
SOOKIE: No Luke at all.
LORELAI: No, I mean, it wouldn't be that big a difference. It's not like I see him a lot as it is.
SOOKIE: Well, that's true, although just because you don't see him a lot doesn't mean he's not a big part of your life. You know eight months ago, you were engaged to the guy.
LORELAI: I know. I try not to dwell on that because I've moved on. I-I married Christopher.
SOOKIE: Ah it's just that it's Luke. You guys were together a long time.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: You were friends for years even before you were together. And then, when you were together, you were really together.
LORELAI: Yes. We were.
SOOKIE: So all I'm saying is that you broke up with Luke and immediately started dating Christopher. And I know you're over it, and I know you've moved on, but all those feelings for Luke didn't just disappear overnight, right?
LORELAI: No that's what I'm saying. Of course they didn't.
SOOKIE: It's just, you moved really quickly.
LORELAI: Yes, I moved quickly to a man I love who loves me, who wanted to marry me. When Luke and I were together, he was kind and loyal and thoughtful. The guy built me an ice-skating rink, for god's sake.
SOOKIE: God, I forgot about that.
LORELAI: But he was also distant and uncommunicative, and he didn't want to marry me. And I tried everything I could to work it out. Of course I have feelings for him. That's what Christopher's responding to, and that's why, in order to save my marriage, the only thing I can do is cut Luke out, right?
SOOKIE: Right.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
SOOKIE: I'm sorry, it's just, I have a but.
LORELAI: Yes?
SOOKIE: If there were no Luke, I mean no Luke in the past, no Luke in the picture...
LORELAI: Yeah?
SOOKIE: Well, would it be Christopher? Would he be "the one"?
[Lorelai doesn't answer]
SOPHIE'S MUSIC SHOP
[Michel and Lorelai enter]
MICHEL: I don't even know why we are bothering to select music. Why not just turn on the radio and hope for the best? Maybe we'll get lucky and a hip-hop station will be playing Snoop Doggy Dogg.
LORELAI: Michel, come on. I said I'm sorry. We're gonna have a beautiful ceremony. Look, here's Zach. Hi, Zach.
ZACH: Hey. Lorelai. Hello, Michel. I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. It totally blows.
MICHEL: Thank you.
LORELAI: So, Zach's gonna do the music for the ceremony.
ZACH: I'm psyched, dude. At first I was thinking Mandolin, but then I'm like, "whoa, Zach, are you tripping? It's got to be the acoustic guitar." A way more soulful sound.
LORELAI: Um have you thought about the music?
ZACH: Yeah, I did -- vintage Bowie, originally recorded with Herbie Flowers on bass, Aynsley Dunbar on drums. You know where I'm going? "Diamond dogs"? [sings] Whoo-hoo-hoo! They call them the diamond dogs bow-wow, woof woof, whoo-hoo!
LORELAI: That sounds great. Um we didn't need a song that necessarily had dogs in the lyrics, right, Michel?
MICHEL: Whatever. David bowie sounds like a hoot.
LORELAI: More princess Diana, less dog.
ZACH: So you want Elton John?
LORELAI: We were thinking very dignified -- Bach, Mozart.
MICHEL: Céline Dion.
LORELAI: Or Céline Dion.
ZACH: [very serious] Please don't make me do that.
MICHEL: After all, "my heart will go on" was Chin-Chin's favorite song.
LORELAI: Oh, well, then, there you go, huh? We'll just find, uh, [looks through sheet music] "My Heart." "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," "My Heart Belongs to Me," "My Heart Belongs to You." My heart can't make up its mind.
ZACH: How about "Tears in Heaven"? That's a wicked song.
LORELAI: Well, "My Heart is Crying for You," "My Heart is Waiting," "My Heart Stood Still." People very interested in this whole heart thing.
ZACH: "I will always love you" -- it's got the cheese factor, but it's still at least a legitimate…
LORELAI: "My Heart Will Go On."
MICHEL: Oh, good! They have it!
LORELAI: So you get working on that, and, uh, we'll be moving on.
SOPHIE'S MUSIC SHOP - EXTERIOR
[Michel and Lorelai exit]
LORELAI: Okay, so, we're all set with the music, and the rest of the flowers should be delivered in about an hour. You got your suit from the cleaners. All we have to do now is stop by the printer's and approve the layout for the program.
MICHEL: Actually, as long as we're here, I think I'm gonna stop into Luke's.
LORELAI: Really? Why?
MICHEL: Do you remember last year when that troupe of Mimes took over the inn?
LORELAI: Yeah.
MICHEL: It was a very stressful time for me, guessing at what they wanted, watching to see what they were pointing at so I knew what to fetch them. When they finally left, I needed a bit of comfort, so I stopped at Luke's and I bought a hamburger.
LORELAI: [Gasps] You didn't.
MICHEL: I know. It was a moment of insanity. Thank god by the time I got home, I had already calculated that it would take me 55 minutes of medium-intensity interval training on my elliptical machine to work it off. Thought better of the whole thing and dumped the foul thing in the trash.
LORELAI: Well close call.
MICHEL: Yeah, extremely. Unfortunately, Chin-Chin, being the little rascal that he was, fished it out of the garbage.
LORELAI: Aw.
MICHEL: After all the exotic dog food I lavished on him -- homemade biscuits, fresh-ground lamb -- it was this burger that he seemed to enjoy the most. And today, I will eat one in his memory.
LORELAI: Well, what a sacrifice. Uh, go on in. You get your burger. I'll get started at the printer's.
MICHEL: Sounds good. Wish me luck.
LORELAI: Good luck.
[Lorelai stands there a few seconds and sees Luke at the counter, her sees her and wave. She waves back before turning to leave]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Hallway outside, Rory comes home to see Logan waiting]
RORY: What are you doing here?!
[They hug]
LOGAN: Aw, I couldn't wait till Sunday.
RORY: Oh!
LOGAN: What's that look?
RORY: Oh, Paris calls it my harlequin romance face. Come on in!
LOGAN: Where is the infamous Miss Geller?
RORY: [looking at the chart] Now? Let's see. This afternoon, she is belly dancing with the Yale Belly Dance Society at the Payne Whitney gym.
LOGAN: Wow, how'd you get out of it?
RORY: I'm supposed to be at a wrestling match. We're supposed to trade notes later.
LOGAN: Use the term "half nelson."
RORY: I'll use the term "whole nelson." I'm not afraid.
LOGAN: Yeah, don't do that.
[They kiss]
RORY: Logan, um, I have to talk to you.
LOGAN: Sure, what's going on?
RORY: Well, uh, maybe let's sit. Yeah, come on. Sit down.
LOGAN: Okay.
RORY: Okay. Um... this is hard for me to bring up, but, um, because of the whole thing that happened with Marty. I just wanted to tell you about it now so that you don't think this is a big deal. Or, actually, maybe it is a big deal. I don't know that's why I want to talk to you about it.
LOGAN: What's going on?
RORY: Well, maybe it's just human nature. I mean, maybe we don't want to be happy.
LOGAN: You're not happy?
RORY: No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm so happy.
LOGAN: Okay, good, so what's the problem?
RORY: Um, I don't know. See I never thought of myself as a self-destructive person before, but I don't know -- maybe I do have this weird self-sabotaging streak.
LOGAN: What are you talking about?
RORY: Well, the grad student who's filling in for my grandfather -- I guess he's kind of good-looking. And I ran into him at the bookstore, and I told him I liked Isabel Allende, and it was disgusting!
LOGAN: You told him you like Isabel Allende?
RORY: But it was the way I said it. I was all nervous and weird. I mean I Googled him after class. I don't know even know why. I just, you're being so perfect, and I'm turning into this monster.
LOGAN: You're not a monster.
RORY: No, I am. I am. I just I think I got so safe and felt so good with you that I let my guard down, and this beast emerged.
LOGAN: Hey, make up your mind. Are you a beast or a monster?
RORY: Logan.
LOGAN: What it sounds like what you telling we you have a crush on this guy.
RORY: I'm so sorry. What why are you looking at me like that?
LOGAN: It's just a crush.
RORY: You're not upset?
LOGAN: I'd be a hypocrite, because I have on occasion found other girls attractive.
RORY: Yes, I know.
LOGAN: But I would never do anything about it because I love you and want to be with you.
RORY: That's good, I guess.
LOGAN: You guess.
RORY: No, it is good. It's just, did I break you?
LOGAN: What?
RORY: Paris said that I broke you, that if I kicked you with my spurs, you wouldn't spook. Is that true?
LOGAN: No, I'd definitely be a little spooked.
RORY: You know what I mean.
LOGAN: I honestly don't.
RORY: I guess she meant that you belong to me or something.
LOGAN: Well, do you belong to me?
RORY: Yeah, I guess I do.
LOGAN: Well, then I'm cool with that.
RORY: You are?
LOGAN: Yeah. This whole thing is my fault.
RORY: What? Why?
LOGAN: I was a jerk about Marty. I overreacted, and I obviously freaked you out so much I made you think you have to tell me when you recommend a book to a guy, and you don't, okay.
RORY: Yeah, okay.
LOGAN: Because I trust you completely, and I'm not worried about us.
RORY: Yeah, I guess I'm not either. It's weird.
LOGAN: But good weird?
RORY: Great weird.
[They kiss]
LOGAN: Can I ask you a question?
RORY: Yeah. Anything.
LOGAN: Has Paris ever belly danced before?
RORY: No, I think this is her first class.
LOGAN: Another question?
RORY: sh**t.
LOGAN: Why the hell aren't we over there watching her?
RORY: Yeah, we should.
LOGAN: [Chuckles]
DRAGONFLY INN - FUNERAL
[Most people are seated, Lane and Kirk are amount the mourners, Zach is playing "My heart will go on" on his acoustic guitar. Lorelai is standing in the door way, she is in deep thought.]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Night, Chris is waiting, Lorelai comes home]
LORELAI: Hi.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: How was the funeral?
LORELAI: Sad.
[They both sit on the couch]
LORELAI: [Sniffles] It's not just Luke.
CHRISTOPHER: Lor...
LORELAI: I mean, you were right. There are feelings there, because... when that ended, I just jumped.
CHRISTOPHER: I pushed you.
LORELAI: I jumped. But if that's all there was -- if that's all it was, we could fix it, you know... with time.
CHRISTOPHER: But it's not.
LORELAI: You've always been this...possibility for me... ...this wonderful possibility. But it's just not right. And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
CHRISTOPHER: [Nods] Yeah. [pause] I guess I should have known, huh? It took me 20 years to get you to say yes.
LORELAI: [Voice breaking] I need you to know... that you're the man... I want to want.
CHRISTOPHER: I know.
LORELAI: [Sniffles and starting to cry] You have no idea... how badly I wish...
CHRISTOPHER: I do. [pause] I do know.
LORELAI: [Sniffles]
[Chris squeezes Lorelai's hand]
CHRISTOPHER: I do.

PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Hallway outside, Lorelai knocks on the door, New-age music playing]
PARIS: [From inside] Yes?
LORELAI: Um, Paris, it's Lorelai.
PARIS: Come in. The door is open.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry that it's so early. I… oh. Wow. Hey.
PARIS: Sorry. We're in the middle of our yoga practice.
LORELAI: I didn't, uh, really imagine you guys to be the yoga types.
DOYLE: It was a circuitous path that led us here.
PARIS: I only signed up for the class 'cause I thought it'd help me B.S. My way through any med-school interviews when they talk about all that homeopathic, holistic, naturopathic, chiropractic, tcm, unani, ayurveda crap.
DOYLE: Plus, we thought it would be funny to goof on. But now...
PARIS: I guess the great cosmic goof is on us.
LORELAI: Is Rory asleep?
PARIS: You mean spiritually or literally?
LORELAI: Literally.
PARIS: Yeah, I think so.
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT – RORY'S ROOM
[Lorelai knock on Rory's door]
RORY: Hey, mom.
LORELAI: Hey. Sorry I didn't call first. I left my phone at home. And it's 6:00 in the morning. Why are you up?
RORY: Ah Paris and Doyle were chanting. Why are you up?
LORELAI: Oh, I've been up for a while, driving…
RORY: Driving?
LORELAI: Yeah for a few hours.
RORY: Driving?
LORELAI: Yeah driving.
RORY: Mom, what's going on?
LORELAI: Want to go for a drive?
RORY: Um, sure. Let's go for a drive.
JEEP – DRIVING
[Rory and Lorelai road unknown]
RORY: So...we're driving.
LORELAI: Yeah, we're driving. [quite for a few seconds] Honey, your dad and I split up… last night.
RORY: Oh, mom, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
LORELAI: I'm okay -- I'm driving, moving forward.
RORY: You are driving.
LORELAI: Yep. It just wasn't right, you know? And he knew it wasn't right, and I knew it wasn't right. It just wasn't...
RORY: It wasn't right.
LORELAI: It wasn't, and pretending it was, was just gonna hurt him and hurt me, and we didn't want to do that, so we split up, and he's moving out, and... what are you thinking?
RORY: I don't know. I guess, first of all, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. And...secondly... I guess I'm thinking that I'm not totally surprised. I mean, at first, I was so excited that you guys were getting together because it seemed like something that was meant to be.
LORELAI: Yep
RORY: Something that was like destiny. But...then... I guess... to me, it kind of never felt right. I'm so sorry.
LORELAI: I just want you to know, your dad is gonna be in your life -- in our lives.
RORY: I know that.
LORELAI: And Gigi, too. I mean, your dad is still your dad, you know?
RORY: I know that, mom. I do. So, who else knows?
LORELAI: Nobody. That's it. Well, you and the Quickie Mart guy.
RORY: You told the Quickie Mart guy?
LORELAI: I was upset. I was standing by the magazines. I didn't want him to think I was verklempt over Nicole Richie. So...that's it. I wish I could leave it at that. The idea of telling your grandmother -- god.
[Jeep starts making noises and the engine shuts off]
LORELAI: Oh. Oh, wow.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I... we're out of gas?
RORY: We're out of...gas.
[Lorelai tries to start the Jeep.]
RORY: Hmm.
LORELAI: I've never run out of gas before.
RORY: Me neither.
LORELAI: Well, here we are.
RORY: Out of gas.
LORELAI: Well, I guess I should ca-- I don't have my cell phone.
RORY: I left mine in my room. Okay. It's okay. No, it's fine. We'll just have to get gas somehow. We can do this.
LORELAI: There's a gas station up ahead, where route 68 goes through Naugatuck.
RORY: Okay. So...we're walking?
LORELAI: Oh, we're walking.
[They both chuckle and exit the Jeep.]
LORELAI: Well, it's a beautiful day.
RORY: Yes, it is.
LORELAI: It's weird that it can be so beautiful.
RORY: Yeah. How far is Naugatuck from here?
LORELAI: I don't know exactly.
RORY: I guess it's walking distance.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] I hope it's walking distance.

LORELAI: Oh. Okay. [Chuckles] Thank you.
AURORA: Um...I t-- I think she's in the living room. I'm not sure. Uh...

EMILY: Hello, Rory, Lorelai. How are you?
LORELAI: Oh good. How are you? How's dad? Is he up to this, you think?
EMILY: Why wouldn't he be?
LORELAI: Well mum he just got out of the hospital. I just wonder if it's too soon.
EMILY: The doctor said there's no reason he can't go back to his normal routine, as long as he doesn't do anything too strenuous. It's not as though sitting at a table having dinner with one's family requires a great deal of effort.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] Oh well... you're right.
EMILY: He should be down by now. Is Christopher coming?
LORELAI: Um...he's not able to make it tonight. I'm sorry.
EMILY: Well... that's too bad. In the meantime, can I offer you a drink?
LORELAI: Yes. The usual -- Martini up, with a twist.
EMILY: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not serving alcohol tonight.
LORELAI: [Too Rory] I told you there was something wrong with my ears. [too Emily] What?
EMILY: I'm serving nonalcoholic cocktails only.
LORELAI: There's no such thing as a nonalcoholic cocktail.
EMILY: There most certainly is. It's called a Mocktail.
LORELAI: You're serving Mocktails?
EMILY: Yes. I can offer you a Shirley Temple or Roy Rogers.
RORY: I'll have a Roy Rogers.
LORELAI: Why not a howdy doody or a captain kangaroo?
EMILY: Lorelai, stop being so selfish. We're doing this for your father. After you've had open-heart surgery, alcohol is strictly verboten.
LORELAI: [too Rory] No alcohol. No alcohol.
EMILY: Well, there you are. I told you to tell Mr. Gilmore that his daughter and granddaughter were pulling into the driveway15 minutes ago.
FRANCETTE: Mr. Gilmore says he's in the middle of watching golf and he'll be down as soon as he's finished.
EMILY: Golf? He's watching golf? Well, if you tell him we're expecting him downstairs, I would very much appreciate it.
FRANCETTE: I'm not really sure that falls under my job description….Fine. Fine.
EMILY: Fine.
FRANCETTE: Fine.
EMILY: Here you go.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Oh, that's a strong one, mom. You know I'm driving.
RORY: Tastes great.
LORELAI: You know what else tastes great? Rum.
EMILY: For heaven's sake, Lorelai. If you're unable to go for a few hours without alcohol, I can send the maid out to get you a six-pack. [Seeing Richard on the stairs] Richard!
RICHARD: All right. I'm here. You can put away your leash.
RORY: Hey, grandpa.
LORELAI: Hey, dad.
RICHARD: Rory, Lorelai.
LORELAI: How are you feeling?
RICHARD: Well like a man who's been torn away from one of the most pivotal golf matches in history.
LORELAI: If you're not up for it, we can take a rain check.
EMILY: We don't need a rain check. Richard, wouldn't you like to change for dinner?
RICHARD: No, if you're going to treat me like a patient, I'm going to act like a patient. Patients wear robes.
EMILY: All right. Fine. May I offer you a Mocktail?
RICHARD: No. I don't want a Mocktail. In fact, I'd like to skip "Mocktail hour" altogether and go straight to dinner.
EMILY: B-but it isn't time yet to…
RICHARD: [Sighs]
EMILY: All right. We'll eat now. Ah Francette, would you please go tell Aurora to tell Stefan we are ready to have dinner served now?
FRANCETTE: Look, Mrs. Gilmore, I have to reiterate, I am here as a medical professional, not a carrier pigeon.
RICHARD: Well, as a medical professional, you should be concerned with my health. And not eating isn't healthy, is it? Nor is getting agitated. And I have to tell you Francette, I'm getting quite agitated.
FRANCETTE: Don't threaten me, Mr. Gilmore.
EMILY: It's fine, it's fine. I'll go tell her myself.
[They start to move into the dinning room]
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: A six-pack sounds really good right now.
[Now in the dinning room, classical music playing]
AURORA: Here's your plate, sir. I hope it's not too hot -- the plate, not the food. [Whispers indistinctly]
RICHARD: Oh, well. It's fish again.
EMILY: It's sea bass.
RICHARD: And sea bass is a fish -- hence my comment "surprise, surprise -- it's fish again."
RORY: It tastes good.
RICHARD: Tastes like fish.
EMILY: I don't think it tastes fishy. Sea bash is not a fishy fish. Mackerel is a fishy fish. Trout can be a fishy fish. But sea bass is not really a fishy fish.
RICHARD: I didn't say it tasted fishy. I said it tasted like fish.
RORY: I think it tastes good.
LORELAI: You know the green beans are very green-beany, which is so good, especially if you like green beans, which I do.
RORY: Mmm.
LORELAI: Anyone see any good movies lately?
EMILY: No.
RICHARD: This fish is bland.
EMILY: Would you like some more lemon-dill sauce?
RICHARD: No.
EMILY: Okay.
LORELAI: The sauce is good.
EMILY: It's nice, isn't it?
LORELAI: Tart, but not too tart. Stefan, the chef we stole from the Lowells, is doing a marvelous job incorporating the dietary recommendations…
RICHARD: Enough. If forced, I may eat this fish, but I absolutely refuse to waste my time having a conversation about it. So, Lorelai, I take it that Christopher is still out of town?
LORELAI: He...couldn't make it tonight.
RICHARD: That's too bad.
EMILY: That man has been traveling quite a lot lately.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, I guess.
RICHARD: Well I hope he'll be around for the party your mother's planning. I know I'm looking forward to it. It's my only hope for eating a decent meal in the foreseeable future. Your mother was planning to serve Cornish game hens. Is that still the plan, Emily?
EMILY: Yes, I've even spoken to the caterer about preparing a special skinless hen for you.
RICHARD: Oh, for heaven's sakes.
EMILY: Don't get angry, Richard. It's your doctor's orders, not mine.
RICHARD: You know what? I'm full.
RORY: These flowers are pretty.
LORELAI: They really are nice.
RICHARD: If you will excuse me, I have to get back to my golf.
EMILY: Richard!
RICHARD: Please. I know I've missed Jacklin's bogey on the 16th. I'm not missing his putt on the 17th. That's a famous putt, Emily.
EMILY: Wait -- you're watching an old golf game? Well, it's the last singles match of the '69 Ryder cup. Jacklin, Nicklaus -- the concession!
EMILY: I can't believe you're watching an old golf game instead of eating...
RICHARD: Fish?
EMILY: Dinner with your family. You already know how it's going to turn out.
RICHARD: Well, that never stopped people going to see "Hamlet." Lorelai, Rory, good night. Emily.
EMILY: Richard... Richard!
EMILY: The idea that two grown men hitting a tiny ball with metal sticks is the equivalent of "hamlet" -- ridiculous. But can I say anything? No! Because I can't agitate him.
LORELAI: It is ridiculous. Golf is more like "Richard III." You know they're all hunched over.
EMILY: I'm going to go get him.
RORY: It sounds like grandma's going full steam ahead with this whole party-planning thing.
LORELAI: I know!
RORY: She's going to k*ll 400 Cornish game hens – probably with her own bare hands.
LORELAI: Your grandfather just had a heart attack. Your grandmother is not drinking. This isn't exactly the ideal time to tell them their one and only daughter's marriage is over.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: I don't know what she'll do. She's gone bananas. I mean for all I know, she'll throw a Molotov Mocktail at me.
RORY: I know, but only you can save the Cornish game hens. Save the Cornish game hens!
LORELAI: [Sighs]
LOGAN'S NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT
[Morning, Rory is preparing a tray of food]
RORY: Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? Get back in bed.
LOGAN: I just want to check my e-mail real quick.
RORY: Oh, no, no, no.
LOGAN: What's the big deal?
RORY: Well I made you a special birthday breakfast in bed, and if you don't go back to bed, it's gonna be a special birthday breakfast at a desk, which is something I have never heard of. Happy birthday.
[They kiss]
LOGAN: Mmmm, now it is, now that there are cinnamon buns in the picture.
RORY: Are you impressed? It's my specialty. I can cook anything that comes in a tube.
LOGAN: I am impressed and hungry.
RORY: Nuh-unh-unh! Get back in bed! You are the birthday boy. You should not be working. You should be luxuriating, eating peeled grapes and being fanned with palm fronds.
LOGAN: Peeled grapes ha.
RORY: Mm-Hmm.
LOGAN: Well, what if the birthday boy gets back in bed but is allowed to bring his laptop?
RORY: Deal.
LOGAN: So somebody's pretty into this whole birthday thing.
RORY: Well if by "birthday thing," you mean the celebration of the miracle of your birth, the anniversary of the day when this world went from being a world without Logan Huntzberger to a world with Logan Huntzberger, then, yes, I'm pretty into it.
LOGAN: You really love me, don't you?
RORY: Well you're okay.
LOGAN: I'm not used to all this hoopla. Birthdays aren't a very big deal in the Huntzberger family.
RORY: Why not?
LOGAN: Because birthdays aren't something you achieve. Why should you be lauded for something that just happens?
RORY: Well didn't you have birthday parties when you were a kid?
LOGAN: They were parties, sort of, but not with any kids I actually knew.
RORY: That sounds like a blast.
LOGAN: And I never had a regular birthday cake. I always wanted just a good old, plain yellow cake. You know with cake frosting but desserts were some fancy flambé thing with alcohol in them.
RORY: Well, those years of birthday neglect will become a faint memory after the Gilmore treatment.
LOGAN: Plenty of hoopla in a Gilmore birthday, huh?
RORY: Mm-hmm. Hoopla and then some. My mom always went all out.
LOGAN: How's your mom doing?
RORY: She's okay.
LOGAN: And you?
RORY: I feel like celebrating your birthday. Why are you working? It's your birthday. And I thought your deal was already closed.
LOGAN: It is.
RORY: Well then all that's left to do is celebrate -- and to tell your dad, because you said Huntzberger's celebrate achievement right. Isn't closing this deal a pretty big achievement?
LOGAN: Well I don't want to tell my dad -- not yet. He can read about it in the wall street journal, which in fact is what I just had sent to me -- the press release.
RORY: The press release, huh? That's fancy.
LOGAN: [reading] "Huntzberger, a young visionary entrepreneur." Does that sound dorky?
RORY: Nope. Sounds great. It's exciting.
LOGAN: These are good, by the way.
RORY: Good.
LOGAN: But what would be great with them is a nice bowl of peeled grapes.
RORY: Oh yeah.
LOGAN: Would you make peeled grapes?
RORY: If they come in a tube, I do.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Telephone rings, Lorelai answers it.]
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: Lorelai?
[Emily is at her home]
LORELAI: Mum.
EMILY: They won't deliver.
LORELAI: Who won't deliver what.
EMILY: And, apparently, none of their help has driver's licenses. That's a little irresponsible, don't you think?
LORELAI: You got to help me out a little here mum.
EMILY: [Sighs, then to Francette] Why are you leering at me?
LORELAI: I'm not leering at… mother, are you on peyote?
FRANCETTE: Mr. Gilmore's light bulb is bothering him.
EMILY: I'm sorry -- is that some sort of nurse code?
FRANCETTE: The 60-watt bulb on his bedside lamp is apparently casting a harsh glare on the television.
EMILY: Well, then, get him another light bulb.
FRANCETTE: It's just not my job.
EMILY: Then get Francette to do it.
FRANCETTE: I am Francette.
LORELAI: [Heard on the phone] Mom!
FRANCETTE: Aurora is the maid.
EMILY: Then Aurora, ask aurora to find a light bulb.
FRANCETTE: I can't find aurora.
EMILY: You can't find aurora?
FRANCETTE: She's hiding from Mr. Gilmore.
LORELAI: [On the Phone] Hello?
EMILY: She's hiding from -- [Scoffs] Never mind. I'll get it myself. Honestly -- these people!
LORELAI: Mother what is going on over there?
EMILY: Your father is running low on his blood thinners, and the pharmacy can't be bothered to deliver.
LORELAI: Are you calling to ask me if I will pick up dad's prescription?
EMILY: Well, I can't leave the house, or chaos will ensue.
LORELAI: You're calling to imply that you would like to ask me to pick up dad's prescription?
EMILY: It's a pharmacy at the corner of Walden and Hasbrook lane. [Emily hangs up]
LORELAI: Okay… [Hearing dial tone] hello? No, it's no problem at all. I'd be happy to. It's just nice to be appreciated. By the way, Chris and I broke up. Bye.
[Lorelai looks a little sad]
LUKE'S DINER
[Babette and Miss Patty, Kirk is sitting near by, Luke is serving tables.]
BABETTE: Yeah, it's true -- he's definitely moved out. Last time I saw the...beagle's car in the driveway, it was days ago. Then I saw the mover's truck, so only the...hen is living there now.
MISS PATTY: So did the hen break up with the beagle, or the beagle with the hen?
BABETTE: I don't know.
MISS PATTY: Oh the poor hen.
BABETTE: Yeah she's been through so much.
MISS PATTY: You know, just kind of getting used to him -- the beagle.
BABETTE: But he's not right for her. He's a beagle, you know. And beagles, beagles belong with beagles.
MISS PATTY: And the hen belongs with the rooster.
BABETTE: Maybe.
MISS PATTY: Well, does the rooster know about the hen and the beagle?
BABETTE: Oh, yeah, East Side Tillie was in here yesterday, blabbing her big mouth off.
MISS PATTY: How did he take it? Did you see his face?
BABETTE: Yeah, but you know the rooster. It's like looking at Stonehenge. I don't know what he thinks.
MISS PATTY: Oh I hope he gets his act together because I think they're perfect.
BABETTE: Yeah, but maybe sh-- the hen belongs with someone else... like a penguin or an ostrich.
KIRK: I can no longer sit here and listen to this.
MISS PATTY: Oh, good. Go sit over there.
KIRK: I'm sorry, but I can't in good conscience let this perverse conversation continue. Are you insinuating that a hen could mate with an ostrich? Because even ignoring the question of biological feasibility, it's completely morally reprehensible.
BABETTE: Oh, buzz off with your "morally reprehensible."
KIRK: How do you expect her to lay those eggs? Have you thought about that, have you?
[Babette and Miss Patty look at each other confused, the door of the diner opens]
LIZ: Hey, big brother!
[They hug]
LUKE: Hey.
T.J.: Surprise!
LUKE: Yes sure am, Liz, T.J., Jeez, and piles of your belongings.
LIZ: It's so good to see you.
LUKE: Yeah, you, too. Hey, Doula.
T.J.: She's looking good, huh?
LUKE: Yeah.
T.J.: Sturdy, too, like she might be a female wrestler or something.
LUKE: Oh, fingers crossed.
T.J.: Right you know what I'm thinking? Free tickets.
LUKE: Yeah. So you two just decided to swing by the diner with a half a dozen bags and a baby apparatus of some kind?
LIZ: No, we decided to come and keep you company.
LUKE: Company?
LIZ: Yeah now that April's in New Mexico, we figured you might be getting a little lonely.
LUKE: Oh, no, I'm not getting lonely. I mean I miss having April around, sure, but I mean I talk to her every Wednesday after swim practice and every Sunday if she's done all her homework. It's going good.
T.J.: Are you buying this? I'm not buying it.
LUKE: Buying what? There's nothing to buy. Hey, where are you going?
LIZ: Oh, don't do the stiff-upper-lip thing with us. We're family. We're here for you.
LUKE: Look, Liz, it's really sweet of you to come by and visit, but… you're planning on staying here for a while?
LIZ: We don't want you to be lonely.
LUKE: How long exactly are you planning on keeping me company?
LIZ: A few days, a week tops.
LUKE: I don't need to be kept company.
LIZ: Well yeah, but you -- we should just come clean.
T.J.: No.
LUKE: Yes about what?
T.J.: About nothing.
LUKE: T.J.
T.J.: How about them Celtics, huh? They sure can dribble a basketball.
LUKE: Liz!
LIZ: We got moths.
LUKE: I'm sorry?
T.J.: Oh, me too, believe me. Luke, it's horrible. I hate those little floppy, fluttery jerks.
LUKE: Moths, huh?
T.J.: Ah dude, they're everywhere -- flying around, popping out of the flour container, congregating around the light bulbs, all pasty and white. I swear moths are like the loser butterflies that couldn't get laid if they tied a $100 bill to their…
LUKE: T.J., I got it. You got moths.
LIZ: So we figured we could avoid the moths and have a little quality time with you.
LUKE: Yeah, all right, just go ahead upstairs, make yourselves at home.
T.J.: Love it!
[Luke looks happy]
GILMORE MANSION – DINNING ROOM
[Emily and Richard are eating dinner, it's very quite]
EMILY: It's Miso Richard, its good for you.
RICHARD: Soup. [puts down the spoon] Stephan, Stephan [to Emily] Soup is not a meal, nor is a salad. Soup and salad are either precursors to a meal or addenda.
EMILY: Richard please.
[Door bell rings]
RICHARD: Soup and salad is not a meal.
EMILY: We have Salmon if you want Salmon.
RICHARD: I don't want salmon, for heavens sakes I don't want Salmon, what I would like is a proper meal.
[Door bell again rings]
EMILY: Aurora the door.
STEPHAN: I was given certain dietary parameters.
RICHARD: [Angry] I know that, I'm not stupid, I know what the situation is here.
[Door bell again rings]
STEPHAN: I just don't know if I can…
EMILY: [shouting] Francette, Aurora, either of you, both of you will someone answer the door. [quieter] I'm sure Stephan is interested in you input Richard.
RICHARD: Well here is my input, this food is in eatable.
[Door bell again rings]
EMILY: Fine I'll get it myself, not that is my job.
STEPHAN: suggestion, maybe you would prefer some light sandwiches.
RICHARD: Sandwiches!
FRONT DOOR
[Emily opens the door]
LORELAI: Hi come bearing drugs.
EMILY: Please don't bellow that.
LORELAI: Bellow what [louder] "Drugs"?!
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: How's dad doing Mom.
EMILY: He's just fine.
RICHARD: [heard from the other room] I swear you can get better food in an airplane, I haven't been in a submarine but I'd wager the food is better there too.
EMILY: It's an adjustment.
LORELAI: Hmm
DINNING ROOM
[Emily and Lorelai enter]
STEPHAN: Let me offer one more suggestion.
RICHARD: What tacos?!
STEPHAN: No I quit!
RICHARD: Fine.
EMILY: Stephan no.
STEPHAN: I'll tell you something, I have worked in so many four-star restaurants I could have my own constellation. And yet I'm treated like this, I'm sorry but I have too much self respect to work for this terror. [throws his apron on the floor and storms out.]
LORELAI: How things going around here
EMILY AND RICHARD: Fine.
LORELAI: Feeling okay dad?
RICHARD: I'm fine, now if you'll excuse me I thing I'm gonna go watch Bob Tway vanquish Greg Norman in the 86' PGA championship.
EMILY: Oh before you go did you manage to call Rod Mandel's office.
RICHARD: No
EMILY: But Angelique called three times this morning.
RICHARD: Bully for her, I'm sorry I have golf to watch.
EMILY: But Richard you didn't eat a thing. He didn't eat a thing.
LORELAI: Well send something up to him.
EMILY: Send what you just saw yourself Stephan just quite.
LORELAI: Well you could make him something [Emily give Lorelai a look] I mean the maid could, what is her name.
EMILY: Oh I don't know, Aurora I think. I don't know anyway she's hiding apparently, [looking] Aurora? Aurora? Where are you?
LORELAI: The maid is hiding?
EMILY: According to the nurse, but she's useless because she won't do anything that doesn't involve a stethoscope.
LORELAI: I can make something for dad.
EMILY: Oh please!
LORELAI: I can make toast, if the conditions are ideal.
EMILY: He won't eat it, anyway. He'll just snap at me, snapping at everyone in sight. The poor maid quivers every time he comes near her. She just quivers.
LORELAI: Oh that terrible.
EMILY: And his accountant's office keeps calling because he's supposed to be filing an 1120. Who knows what an 1120 is?
LORELAI: I do. It's a federal tax form.
EMILY: [Shouting] Aurora! Well he won't call them back. All he wants to do is watch golf.
LORELAI: What's with all the golf?
EMILY: I have no idea. He just lies there in bed, staring at the TV like a zombie. Everything is falling apart everything is chaotic.
LORELAI: Mom, please, sit down. I'm gonna make you a delicious Mocktail, huh? And then you enjoy that and relax and I'll take care of the chef and I'll make sure that dad takes his medicine so you don't have to worry. Here.
EMILY: Thank you. But I'm going to call Angelique and ask about this 1120.
LORELAI: [Sighs] I'll find aurora. [Shouting comically] Aurora!
GILMORE MANSION – KITCHEN
[Later, Lorelai and Sookie enter]
SOOKIE: To heat most of these up, you just zap them for a couple minutes.
LORELAI: Okay.
SOOKIE: Don't worry, each meal has a note with cooking instructions, taped to it.
LORELAI: Did I already tell you you're a goddess?
SOOKIE: You might have mentioned something to that effect. Could I be the one with the multiarms?
LORELAI: The who?
SOOKIE: The goddess with all the arms, I want to be her.
LORELAI: Sure. Hey, these look good.
SOOKIE: Don't sound so surprised.
LORELAI: Yeah, but they're supposed to be healthy, right. I mean they're all healthy? [Lorelai cell phone rings]
SOOKIE: They're ridiculously healthy.
LORELAI: [Answering her phone] Hey!
RORY: What did we do for my 8th birthday?
[Rory is at Logan's apartment and has a piñata with her.]
LORELAI: I don't know. Is this a quiz? Are you on some sort of radio contest?
RORY: No for Logan's birthday, I'm trying to put together a night of all the birthday highlights that he missed.
LORELAI: And you're looking for the classics?
RORY: Exactly. I remember that we had an outer-space birthday when I turned 6.
LORELAI: Right. We made space suits out of garbage bags. We had tang and freeze-dried ice cream.
RORY: And then when I turned 7, we did a fiesta birthday.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Piñatas and tacos and freeze-dried ice cream.
RORY: Oh freeze-dried ice cream is the best. I remember really enjoying my 8th birthday. I just don't remember what it was.
LORELAI: Teddy-bear tea party.
RORY: Oh that's right. So, how's it going over there?
LORELAI: I'd say weirder. Your grandma's a little on edge.
RORY: [her phone beeps] Oh, hey, mom, it's Logan on the other line, can you hold on a sec.
LORELAI: Yeah tell him "happy birthday" for me.
RORY: Will do. [switches to Logan] Happy birthday.
LOGAN: Thank you.
[Logan is in a coffee shop]
RORY: And happy birthday from my mom.
LOGAN: Thank you. Hey, so my dad just called.
RORY: Oh, he did? Yeah. Apparently, he remembered my birthday, and actually he said he wants to take us out to dinner, you and me.
RORY: Oh. That's...great.
LOGAN: Now I know it's last minute and I know you got your special Gilmore hoopla treatment planned, so we don't have to go if you don't want to go.
RORY: No, no, we should go we can always do the Gilmore hoopla after we have dinner with your dad.
LOGAN: Are you sure, it will probably be lame, for all I know, he's invited us to crash a meeting with Rupert Murdoch.
RORY: Well that's cool. I can hang with mad dog Murdoch.
LOGAN: Okay. Well, cool, cool. Thanks Ace. I'll call him back.
RORY: Happy birthday!
LOGAN: Bye!
RORY: [Switches back to Lorelai] Hey, sorry about that.
LORELAI: How's the birthday boy?
RORY: He's good. He's fine. But I guess his dad called and wants to take us out to a birthday dinner tonight.
LORELAI: That sounds like a load of laughs.
RORY: Yeah, Mitchum -- that man is fundamentally incapable of making me feel anything but small and awful.
LORELAI: Now that's not true, he's made you feel incompetent, too.
RORY: Well I guess Logan was excited that his dad wanted to take us out, so that's sweet. Have you told grandma and grandpa about you and dad yet?
LORELAI: Um, not yet.
RORY: Well I feel obligated to remind you that the lives of 400 Cornish game hens hang in the balance.
LORELAI: Happy Logan's birthday.
RORY: Happy Logan's birthday to you.
LORELAI: Bye. [Hangs up} Mmm, that looks unhealthy.
SOOKIE: Thank you.
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke is getting dinner ready, Liz is making jewelry and TJ is looking after Doula, b*at music starts playing]
T.J.: Oh, I love this song.
LIZ: I don't know why we didn't think of this before.
LUKE: Think of what?
LIZ: Using your fishing line for stringing -- it's really incredible. Durable yet plenty thin and flexible.
LUKE: I'm glade.
LIZ: And some of this doohickeys, man, are really cute. Check it out -- sexy, yeah?
T.J.: Oh, wow, babe, these are gorgeous.
LIZ: Thank you, sweetie.
T.J.: I'm so proud of your sister, Luke. This jewelry stuff has really taken off, you know? And it's great, you know because now I can be the stay-at-home dad I've always dreamed of being while this one goes out and brings home the bacon.
LIZ: We're gonna drive our new van from trade show to trade show, selling the jewelry. Like in a couple weeks, there's this big show in Manhattan.
LUKE: Oh yeah.
LIZ: Yeah at the Javits center.
T.J.: We'll just load up the van, head up 91, and start showing off the family jewels.
LUKE: Oh sounds good but I wouldn't take the 91 through New Haven. There's tons of construction there now. I'd take the Merritt.
LIZ: How do you know?
LUKE: ‘Cause I went there to visit Lorelai's dad when he had the heart attack.
LIZ: You did?
LUKE: Yeah I thought I told you that.
LIZ: No you told me he had a heart attack. You didn't tell me you went to the hospital.
LUKE: What's the big deal?
LIZ: [Laughs] I don't know. I mean, you went there for Lorelai, and what's going on with her and her husband?
LUKE: I don't know. They split up or something.
LIZ: They did?
LUKE: Yeah, well, a week or so ago.
LIZ: Well, well, well.
LUKE: What?
LIZ: The plot thickens.
LUKE: The plot does not thicken, okay? We're friends -- that's all. I just went out when I heard her dad was sick.
T.J.: Phew! That is a relief.
LIZ: T.J.!
T.J.: What it's a load off my mind, that's all I'm saying. ‘Cause I don't think you should get back together with her.
LUKE: Nobody's talking about getting back together with her.
T.J.: Good. ‘Cause that woman is drama. Every time you mention her, it's got something to do with the hospital.
LUKE: What!
LIZ: So how's her dad doing?
LUKE: Well good, I guess.
LIZ: You haven't called Lorelai?
LUKE: No.
T.J.: Don't call her. Don't open that Pandora's box.
LIZ: If he wants to call her, he should -- they're friends.
T.J.: Just lock it up, Luke. Lock it up. Solder that baby shut.
[Luke looks a little mad]



RESTAURANT – NEW YORK CITY
MAITRE D: Would you follow me, please? Mr. Huntzberger is already at the table.
LOGAN: "Mr. Huntzberger is already at the table."
RORY: I told you.
MITCHUM: Hey, hey there they are. Happy birthday, Logan. Rory,
RORY: Hi
MITCHUM: Great to see you.
RORY: You too.
MITCHUM: Sit, sit. I took the liberty of ordering a bottle of champagne for the table.
LOGAN: Oh nice.
MITCHUM: Rory, how does that sound?
RORY: Sounds like music to my ears.
MITCHUM: Good, good, so, you look pretty good. You been hitting the squash courts lately?
LOGAN: Oh man I wish. I haven't had much of a chance. I've been working pretty much nonstop these days.
RORY: He has been.
MITCHUM: Well, good for you. A little hard work never hurt anybody. To my son -- now a quarter of a century old. Not bad. And to his lovely girlfriend -- the beautiful and always witty Rory.
LOGAN: Hear, hear.
WAITER: Here's a little Amuse-Bouche with avocado and crabmeat, compliments of the chef.
MITCHUM: Oh, tell Markham thanks.
RORY: You know the chef here?
MITCHUM: Yeah, I've known him for, uh... wow... almost 15 years now. Interesting story, actually -- he was the Sous chef at Le Bernardin, ah for a bunch of years. [Trying the food] Mmm... that's good. That's good crab. Anyway, one day, he just quit -- said he wanted to start his own restaurant. Everyone thought it was a bad idea at the time. The odds were against him. Opening a successful restaurant in Manhattan is like catching a firefly in your hand, only a hell of a lot more expensive.
LOGAN: Well all I can tell you is this Amuse-Bouche is great.
RORY: Yes, my mouth is very amused.
MITCHUM: [Chuckles] That's funny. But it was a very gutsy move. And it paid off.
LOGAN: He caught that firefly.
MITCHUM: Exactly. So, Rory, tell me -- are you still planning to pursue journalism?
RORY: Yes I am, I have been writing some articles for an online magazine and I've just applied for the James Reston reporting fellowship.
MITCHUM: You know what you should read? Philip Meyer's latest book…
RORY: "The Vanishing Newspaper." I read it. I loved it.
MITCHUM: It's an interesting time in journalism. You know. I'll tell you what our field needs -- an infusion of bright, talented people like you, Rory.
RORY: Thank you.
MITCHUM: I mean it.
GILMORE MANSION – RICHARD'S OFFICE
[Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: So, dad took his medicine. He at half of Sookie's chicken and the entire mango smoothie. I got three recommendations of personal chefs from Sookie, two of them I've spoken to on the phone, [handing the notes] there.
EMILY: Thank you. Why are you doing all this?
LORELAI: I'm just trying to help mum. I don't want you to be stressed.
EMILY: But I am. I'm so stressed out I can't find anything.
LORELAI: What are you looking for?
EMILY: Your father's accountant wants all sorts of information so he can file these taxes, which are apparently due in February.
LORELAI: Maybe I can help.
EMILY: How can you help?
LORELAI: Mom, I have a business. I helped dad set up this business. I went to business school. Here let me see that.
EMILY: What are you doing? Don't touch the computer. You could mess something up.
LORELAI: Don't worry, mom. I know what I'm doing. Okay, so he's using quicken. A profit and loss statement, a balance sheet, a schedule of assets are things I can pull up. We can e-mail them to the accountant for the 1120.
EMILY: How do you know about 1120s?
LORELAI: Well I have to file them for the inn. The inn's a corporation just like dad's company.
EMILY: Why is everything a corporation?
LORELAI: We incorporated so we were protected from personal liability. So if someone was horribly allergic to pillow mints and wanted to sue me for a million dollars, I wouldn't have to pay for it out of my own pocket.
EMILY: Your father and I don't have anyone who wants to sue us.
LORELAI: Well, dad probably did it for tax purposes. It looks like he's got a couple of different investments, some stocks, a rental building.
EMILY: Would you like a drink?
LORELAI: Mmm, I thought the house was dry.
EMILY: Vodka or scotch?
LORELAI: Wow, it's a regular speakeasy.
EMILY: Would you like a drink or not?
LORELAI: Vodka, please.
[Opens it ready to drink]
EMILY: I have glasses.
LORELAI: Oh.
EMILY: Serve yourself. Just because your father can't drink doesn't mean the rest of us should suffer. Cheers. [They drink] Ah! That's better.
LORELAI: Mom, Christopher and I split up.
EMILY: Okay… I hardly know what to say.
LORELAI: Really? That's great. You don't have to say anything at all -- now or ever.
[Silent for a few moments]
EMILY: [Looking at the computer] What's a windmill park?
LORELAI: Uh, it looks like dad owns a couple of windmills in Palm Springs.
EMILY: We own windmills?
LORELAI: Well they're energy generators.
EMILY: I had no idea we owned windmills.
RESTAURANT – NEW YORK CITY
LOGAN: That lamb was terrific, my compliments to the your friend, the chef.
MITCHUM: Well, you're a good orderer. He's always been a good orderer. Even when he was 8 years old, he's always ordered well.
RORY: It's a good k*ll to have.
MITCHUM: It is, it is and you know what I should do? I should just order whatever you're ordering, no matter what it is.
LOGAN: Brains it is, followed by sweetbreads and some rocky mountain oysters. [Laughter from Mitchum, Logan's cell phone rings] Oh, this is a business thing, if you guys don't mind. [On the phone] Huntzberger here. No, I haven't talked to him yet.
MITCHUM: "Huntzberger here."
RORY: Yeah.
MITCHUM: Last year, if he got a call interrupting dinner, it would be an invitation to go drink some bodies expensive liquor and pull some ridiculous prank. He's growing up.
RORY: Yeah, he's doing really great.
MITCHUM: He is, and it's because of you.
RORY: Oh, I don't know about that.
MITCHUM: No, I know you encouraged him to go to London. I know you used your influence in a positive way, and Logan's mother and I really appreciate it.
RORY: Well, I think Logan deserves all the credit for what he's done.
MITCHUM: No, you're too modest, Rory. You've been a real asset to Logan and to our family.
RORY: Oh, well...thanks.
MITCHUM: I know we've had our differences in the past.
RORY: Yeah.
MITCHUM: But I'm glad to know that we're now clearly on the same page.
RORY: Okay, yeah. Good. [Chuckles]
MITCHUM: To being on the same page?
RORY: To being on the same page.
[Glasses clink as they toast]
MITCHUM: I am really glad we got the chance to talk tonight. In part, because we still have more work to do.
RORY: What work?
MITCHUM: Well we have to figure out what his next step should be.
RORY: Uh, well, shouldn't he be figuring that out?
MITCHUM: Well, you're part of the team here. And of course we're gonna take care of you, too.
RORY: What do you mean?
MITCHUM: We have newspapers all around the world. You can take your pick.
RORY: My pick?
MITCHUM: Mm-hmm.
RORY: Um, I seem to remember you saying that I didn't have it.
MITCHUM: Oh, please. Things change. Circumstances change.
[Logan returns]
LOGAN: Sorry that took so long, have you ever noticed that people in Hong Kong are really chatty?
RORY: No I haven't.
MITCHUM: You know what? That's true. I know a guy from Kowloon, and, man, is he a loquacious son of a bitch. Oh, here we go.
WAITER: Apricot and walnut Verenikis drizzled with a raspberry reduction.
[Rory and Logan look at each other]
MITCHUM: I told them to make something special, for your birthday.
LOGAN: Thanks. It looks great.
RORY: Happy birthday.
MITCHUM: Make a wish.
[Blows out the single candle on the cupcake size cake]
MITCHUM: There we go.
[Laughter]
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[They are all in bed, Luke in April's, T.J. and Liz in Luke's. Doula is crying. Everyone is awake.]
LIZ: Hey.
T.J.: Ha?
LIZ: It's your turn.
T.J.: Hey, aren't we supposed to let her just cry to toughen her up and whatnot? Isn't that the latest parenting theory?
LIZ: You only believe in that theory when it's your turn.
T.J.: All right, all right. I just don't want her getting too soft. She's got a wrestling future to think of. Hey, there, little girl. How are you? [Picks Doula up] How are you? Oh.
LIZ: Do you think Luke is lonely? I mean for real.
[Luke is listening]
T.J.: He does look a little lonely around the eyes.
LIZ: I think he's lovesick over Lorelai.
T.J.: Oh, boy.
LIZ: T.J., I'm serious.
T.J.: I just think that he might be better off lonely.
LIZ: I think they belong together.
T.J.: That's not what you said when they broke up. I always thought what you said then made a lot of sense, about them being in two different space-time continuums, something like that.
[Luke moves in bed and looks at the ceiling]
LIZ: It's all about the wormholes.
T.J.: Between the dimensions?
LIZ: Yep, all they've got to do is find the right wormhole.
T.J.: I don't know.
GILMORE MANSION – RICHARDS OFFICE
LORELAI: So, if you want to access your bank and credit-card account information, you...?
EMILY: Click "cash flow center."
LORELAI: Yes, and if you want to see any of these menus, you right-click right, right...yes.
EMILY: And if I want the hidden account bar, I double-click that arrow thing up there on the left.
LORELAI: Mom, exactly.
EMILY: [Sighs] I don't know how I'm gonna do all this.
LORELAI: Mom, what are you talking about you just click, click, click. You got it all down.
EMILY: Now, but I barely understand what you've been telling me. This is your father's job.
LORELAI: Well, he'll be back on the job soon enough.
EMILY: I don't know. Have you seen him? He's wearing a dressing gown.
LORELAI: I know he's watching TV in the bedroom. I know, mom. You've got to give the guy a break. You know he's not gonna watch TV in the bedroom forever.
EMILY: No. No, he's not.
LORELAI: Oh, my god, I don't mean he's gonna die.
EMILY: What are you telling me? That he's going to live forever? That he's immortal? Is that what you're telling me.
LORELAI: No, I'm just saying, with time, you know...
EMILY: It's like a canoe.
LORELAI: What's like a canoe?
EMILY: Life.
LORELAI: Okay.
EMILY: You're just paddling along in a canoe.
LORELAI: Mother, have you ever been in a canoe?
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Well I just can't picture you in a canoe.
EMILY: Your father and I have been paddling a canoe together for years. Only now, he's dropped the paddle.
LORELAI: Ahh!
EMILY: He just dropped it. Not only that, but now the canoe is going in circles.
LORELAI: Ah!
EMILY: Without your father there, I'm paddling on my side and the canoe is spinning in circles, and the harder I paddle, the faster it spins, and it's hard work, and I'm getting tired.
LORELAI: Dizzy, I would think.
EMILY: You are in a kayak. You know how to do all of this.
LORELAI: How does that put me in a kayak?
EMILY: Kayaks have paddles with things on both ends. You steer it by yourself.
LORELAI: Mom, you know how to do things by yourself. You are totally capable.
EMILY: Sure, I went to Smith, and I was a history major, but I never had any plans to be an historian. I was always going to be a wife. I mean, the way I saw it, a woman's job was to run a home, organize the social life of a family, and bolster her husband while he earned a living. It was a good system, and it was working very well all these years. Only when your husband isn't there because he's watching television in a dressing gown, you realize how dependent you are. I didn't even know I owned windmills.
LORELAI: Mom, now you know, and you know how to right-click.
EMILY: But you. You provide for yourself. You're not dependent on anyone.
LORELAI: Hmm.
EMILY: You're independent.
LORELAI: I am kayak, hear me roar.
EMILY: I mean, look at you. For all these years, you've done very well without a husband.
LORELAI: Maybe so, but I still wanted it to work out.
EMILY: You know, the way I was raised, if a married couple split up, it was a disaster, because it meant the system had fallen apart, and it was particularly bad for the woman because she had to go out and find herself another rich husband, only she was older now. But with you, it's not such a disaster, is it?
LORELAI: I guess not.
EMILY: I mean It's really not such a horrible thing that you're going to get a divorce, not really. Oh, you're gonna be fine.
[Lorelai flinches a little as Emily rubs her shoulder]
LORELAI: [very quite] Thanks, mom.
EMILY: You may even marry someone else someday. Who knows?
LORELAI: [Snorts] Who knows? [Sighs]
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Logan and Rory arrive home]
LOGAN: Do you know what I think impressed my dad the most? You eating a 24-ounce steak. Seriously, it was, like, a magic trick to him. It was a pretty fun dinner, though.
RORY: Yeah, it was.
LOGAN: Whoa! Look at all this! Ace! Oh, my god, you got me a piñata!
RORY: Well, you deserve a piñata. I couldn't reach the ceiling, so I just... hey, um, Logan...
LOGAN: Yeah?
RORY: Um...your dad and I had a bit of a weird conversation tonight.
LOGAN: Oh yeah.
RORY: Yeah, he started thanking me for guiding you and steering you, or -- I don't know. And then he said that he and I should start planning your future, like, together.
LOGAN: Well, that's my dad for you.
RORY: Well, it felt really weird. I mean I felt like we were conspiring or something. I didn't even agree with what he was saying. I ended up toasting. I toasted him.
LOGAN: What did you toast?
RORY: "To being on the same page," which I'm not. I'm not even on the same page with him. You know I, I actually think that everything you've accomplished is just because you've worked hard, and I'm proud of you. I don't even know how the conversation ended up where it did.
LOGAN: It's okay you know what just happened? You got Huntzbergered. That's what my dad does to people. He's the mast manipulator. You sit down, and you have your own opinions. But by the time you stand up, you hear yourself agreeing with him, and you stagger away confused and queasy.
RORY: Yes! That's exactly it! I got Huntzbergered!
LOGAN: It happens to the best of us.
RORY: Well, I'm glad you're not upset.
LOGAN: No, not at all, I mean, I don't like the fact that the guy thinks of me as some kind of puppet, but I have a hunch that pretty soon, he's gonna have to rethink that one.
RORY: Hmm.
LOGAN: You got me twister. I never had twister.
RORY: You didn't?
LOGAN: No. It was a childhood of deprivation. Oh, and "pin the tail on the --" what animal is that?
[Rory puts on some music]
RORY: Oh, that was a donkey, but I messed the ears up, put antlers on it. Now it's "pin the tail on the moose."
LOGAN: I never had "pin the tail on the moose" as a boy, either.
RORY: Poor little rich boy. I think that since we're short on time, we should skip strait ahead to the classic 12th birthday -- ice-skating in central park.
LOGAN: Sounds good.
[Logan's cell phone rings]
RORY: Great. I'll go change.
LOGAN: [Answering the cell phone] Hey, Philip, what's up, man?
PHILLIP: I'm afraid I've got some grim news.
LOGAN: What, what's going on?
PHILLIP: I just got off the line with our lawyers. They say they just got a cease-and-desist letter from Prism Active, this tech company in Palo Alto, claming prior art on our media 10 platform. They're reviewing the patent now, but…
LOGAN: What do you mean, "prior art"?
PHILLIP: They're claiming patent infringement.
LOGAN: But that's what we bought. Our patent's pending. We bought that technology. That's the entire value of the company.
PHILLIP: But they are saying it's worthless. It was already owned. They were just waiting for someone with deep pockets to buy in before they sued.
LOGAN: Oh, my god.
PHILLIP: I'm so sorry. Happy birthday, man.
{Logan is stunned as he hangs up the call]
MUSIC PLAYING: "They're out to drive me crazy but not right now, I'm high as a cloud…"
RORY: Okay. Close your eyes.
MUSIC PLAYING: "Smoking out the window…"
RORY: Are they closed?
LOGAN: [Sighs] They're closed.
RORY: Okay. Voil.
LOGAN: [Exhales sharply] Wow. It's a giant, furry -- what the hell?
RORY: It's a Russian Ushanka, which also doubles as a birthday crown.
LOGAN: Wow. I bet I look great.
RORY: Mmm, you have no idea.
[Logan turns off the music as they leave.]
LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Morning, Luke enters.]
T.J.: Hey, Luke.
LUKE: Hey T.J.
T.J.: You know what you could use? A changing table.
LIZ: Yeah, and if you're getting stuff for your apartment, you should get a dryer.
LUKE: Yeah I'm not getting things. Why do I need a dryer?
LIZ: Sopping towels.
LUKE: And why are the towels sopping?
T.J.: My bad. I forgot you said not to use the garbage disposal. Well, not forgot, so much as, I thought you were exaggerating.
LUKE: I wasn't exaggerating.
LIZ: And we have more bad news.
LUKE: Oh, yeah?
T.J.: The exterminator said the moths turned out to be rice moths.
LUKE: And this means you'll be staying how much longer?
T.J.: Which means we're headed home right now. Most of the stuff's already in the car.
LIZ: Rice moths are a snap to get rid of. They're already gone. It's just a bummer to leave, 'cause we've been having such a good time.
LUKE: Yeah, yeah, but Doula should be in her own home.
T.J.: That's what we thought, plus your mattress. Not so comfortable, shall we say.
LUKE: Yeah, well, sorry about that.
T.J.: No worries, no worries, but, uh, put it on the list of things you're gonna fix around here. All right, then.
LUKE: Alright.
T.J.: Thanks again.
LUKE: Okay.
T.J.: Your casa is my casa. For that, I'm grateful.
LIZ: You take care.
LUKE: Alright.
LIZ: And call if you're feeling lonely. We will come and visit. Okay, anytime. Anytime.
LUKE: Sounds great.
LIZ: Anytime I mean it. [quietly] Bye.
LUKE: Bye.
[Liz shuts the door.]
LUKE: [Sighs] Oh.
[Luke sits down at the table and looks at the phone]
GILMORE MANSION – DINNING ROOM
[Emily is reading the paper and Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Good morning.
EMILY: Good morning. Would you like some coffee?
LORELAI: Yes. Oh, I woke up this morning, and I've got to say, for the first time in my life, I got where the teetotalers are coming from. If I had a hatchet and a barrel of booze, forget about it.
EMILY: Hmm.
LORELAI: What are you up to today?
EMILY: Today? I'm going to attend a D.A.R. Lecture on native American art work. Then I have a lunch with Sarah Montgomery Brown and Melissa Seria, [sounding annoyed] and, of course, I'll have my hands full canceling the party. I've already called the florist and the hall. We'll only get 60% of our deposit back, but that's better than nothing.
LORELAI: [Inhales deeply] I should go. I need time to change before I have to go to the inn.
EMILY: Fine. [Lorelai starts to leave] Thank you for your help with the Quicken last night.
LORELAI: [Sighs] You're welcome.

STARS HOLLOW BABY SHOP - EXTERIOR
[Lorelai and Rory exit]
RORY: Are you sure we got enough plain onesies?
LORELAI: Let me see. 40 people have RSVP'ed yes to Lane's shower, and we bought 60 onesies for them to decorate. I don't want to go all "Beautiful Mind" on you, but according to my calculations...
RORY: Yes, Mr. Nash, but you are forgetting about the first-pancake phenomenon.
LORELAI: Eh?
RORY: Yes the first pancake – you know you always throw it out. What if people start decorating their onesies and they hate what they do, so they want to start over and we don't have enough onesies because we only estimated one each?
LORELAI: Why do you throw out the first pancake?
RORY: Well the griddle's too hot. It gets b*rned.
LORELAI: Oh, my god. Next year, no excuses. We are making you that audition tape for "Top Chef."
RORY: This is pretty basic stuff.
LORELAI: Do you do it with hamburgers and waffles, too?
RORY: No, it's pancake-specific.
LORELAI: Oh, my goodness. Well, that's good news, because onesies are the exact opposite of pancakes. They're totally impossible to screw up. You can slap anything on a onesie and it looks cute.
RORY: Anything?
LORELAI: Yeah. Alligator, fried egg, tools -- these are not generally considered cute items.
RORY: "I'll take the adorable Phillips-head --" not something you hear normally.
LORELAI: [In a high pitch voice] But you put that on a little onesie…
RORY: You're right – it's pretty damn cute.
LORELAI: So cute. All right, we got streamers and balloons, and the cake's in the fridge. The chairs are getting delivered later. All we have to do now is go home and decorate.
RORY: But did we agree on one table for presents or two?
LORELAI: One.
RORY: Well, don't you think two would be better?
LORELAI: One is fine.
RORY: Okay. But I'm not going for "fine," you know? Lane's shower cannot be fine. I want it to be great.
LORELAI: It will be.
RORY: Yeah but how do you know? I don't have the best track record. Lane's bachelorette party, we ended up in Brian's Aunt's basement. [Rory's cell phone rings]
LORELAI: Well, it was your first pancake.
RORY: Hmm. Hold on. [Answering the phone] Hello? Yes, this is Rory. Um... [mouthing to Lorelai] New York Times. [Both girls are excited] Hi. Um, thank you for calling me back. Thank you so much. Um. Yes. Uh...a-as a matter of fact, I will be. The corner of 9th and -- great. Um, okay. Uh, I'll see you then. [Ends the call] Oh, my god.
LORELAI: The New York Times?
RORY: The New York Times!
LORELAI: They called you?
RORY: Oh my…
LORELAI: Why did they call you?
RORY: Well…
LORELAI: Don't even answer. I mean if I was the New York Times, I would be like, "get me Rory Gilmore on the phone, stat."
RORY: "Stat"?
LORELAI: Whatever the equivalent of "stat" is in the news.
RORY: "Now"?
LORELAI: No! At the New York Times, the language is very fancy. You say "promptly," "presently," "two shakes of a lamb's tail." Why did they call you?
RORY: Well, okay, remember that guy Hugo Gray that I met at Logan's work party, the guy who edits the online magazine?
LORELAI: Yeah, you're writing pieces for him.
RORY: Exactly. well Hugo has an in at the times -- this guy A.J. Abrams. He's an assistant managing editor -- really big. And he gave me A.J.'s number and said that I should call him and see if he would get together with me for coffee so I could pick his brain.
LORELAI: A.J.'s brain?
RORY: Well, Hugo's brain had been picked clean.
LORELAI: Hmm.
RORY: But, yeah, I called A.J., And I never heard anything back. I didn't think he was gonna call me, but that was him just now on the phone, and he said that if I was gonna be in the city tomorrow around 1:00, he could meet me for coffee. And I said, "oh, well, as a matter of fact, I will be." He said something about a place on 9th, and I said, "okay," and he said, "see you tomorrow," and I said, "see you then."
LORELAI: Oh, my god, if this is any indication of the crackling spitfire dialogue to come at your coffee tomorrow -- ha!
RORY: Well this is the worst possible time, but I just couldn't say no.
LORELAI: No, you couldn't say no. I mean, let's face it. "Top Chef" is a long sh*t. This is the New York Times.
RORY: I know but I have so much to do to get ready for Lane's baby shower.
LORELAI: I'll take care of it.
RORY: Are you sure?
LORELAI: Yes, I'm like a professional party-thrower.
RORY: Well, I know, but…
LORELAI: No buts.
RORY: Okay, I mean -- that would be great. I should probably spend the night at Logan's tonight. My laptop's there. I need to print out my résumé. I should. God, I need to prepare. I mean he's gonna expect me to ask him really intelligent questions.
LORELAI: Honey you've been asking intelligent questions since you were 3.
RORY: Yeah I know, he's probably expecting something a little more sophisticated.
LORELAI: Than "what is a color?" ‘cause that one, like, blew my mind.
RORY: Mm. Something a little more newspaper-related, at the very least.
LORELAI: You're gonna be great.
RORY: I hope so I mean even if they don't have an opening there, he knows people all across the country, you know? If I impress him, he can set me up with some really good leads.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, tell him your mother thinks you're spectacular.
RORY: I will do. Oh, my god. The New York Times called me -- and not the subscriptions department.
OPENING CREDITS
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai is decorating]
LORELAI: How's the sign? Is it straight?
SOOKIE: Oh, it's cute. Oh the S, that's funny.
LORELAI: Thanks.
SOOKIE: Not what you asked.
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Hit me again.
LORELAI: Is the sign straight?
SOOKIE: Uh, perfect.
LORELAI: Great.
SOOKIE: Ooh, Angelina and Brad had their baby... months and months ago!
LORELAI: Yeah, you're a little behind the times.
SOOKIE: This is the problem with having two kids under the age of 4 -- world events just, you know, pass you by.
LORELAI: Are you done with those favors?
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm. I cannot believe Britney is driving with her baby on her lap like that. What is she doing with that guy, by the way?
LORELAI: Well, you'll be glad to know they've since broken up, although it turns out he was kind of a stabilizing influence in her life. Who knew!
SOOKIE: You're kidding.
LORELAI: Um Hmm. I know -- why don't you blow up some more balloons or hang some streamers?
SOOKIE: I would love to, but it seems like the baby really wants me to just keep sitting here and reading "In Touch".
LORELAI: You know that excuse expires the minute you pop that baby out.
SOOKIE: Yep, but I've got 128 lazy days left.
LORELAI: Hey, why don't you go through the stack of pictures? ‘Cause Rory is looking for one of Lane that she wants to blow up.
SOOKIE: Ooh, baby pictures -- fun! What do we got? Oh, god. Ooh! This one is so cute.
LORELAI: That's just of Rory, though.
SOOKIE: I know. She was just an itty-bitty, teeny, little, cutie-patootie, wasn't she?
LORELAI: Yeah, she's cute.
SOOKIE: Oh, she weally, weally was, wasn't she?
LORELAI: Seriously, with the voice...
SOOKIE: Well, sorry. I'm hormonal. [Gasps] I just can't believe this wittle girl might be working at the New York Times.
LORELAI: Yeah she's not so wittle anymore. Hey, less Rory, more Lane.
SOOKIE: Don't blame me. I'm not the one that got camera-happy for this Rory kid.
LORELAI: Alright you know what I'm gonna call Mrs. Kim. She'll have some good ones. Have you seen the phone?
SOOKIE: See, the thing is, when I sat down, I realized it was behind me, kind of right on my lower back, and normally I would have, you know, pulled it out, but it's really kind of hitting just the right spot where I've had a knot for like a week. Did I mention I was pregnant? [Hands Lorelai the phone]
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Logan comes home, it's night and the room is dark. Logan enters and throws his coat which knocks over something , waking up Rory.]
RORY: Logan?
LOGAN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go back to bed. Go back to bed.
RORY: Logan, it's really late.
LOGAN: I know. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go back to bed. [Looking in the fridge] Is this all the cheese that we have? I could have sworn we had more cheese.
RORY: It's 3:00 in the morning.
LOGAN: I know. [chucking something to Rory] Here, keep that closed. We're gonna need that in the sandwich-making process.
RORY: Where were you?
LOGAN: What? I was at work.
RORY: What you were at work till 3:00 in the morning?
LOGAN: I work till 3:00 all the time. I mean, not tonight -- tonight, I worked till about 10:00, and that's when Philip and I. We got something to drink, and then a little something turned into a lot of something.
RORY: Yeah!
LOGAN: Who keeps bread in the refrigerator? I hate cold bread. God, these twist ties are impossible.
RORY: Okay, move.
LOGAN: What?
RORY: I'll make you a sandwich.
LOGAN: You will?
RORY: Yes, I will.
LOGAN: Oh, you're so sweet.
RORY: Well, I'm not being sweet. You're just making a mess.
LOGAN: I should have called you.
RORY: Yes, you should have.
LOGAN: Uh-oh. You're mad.
RORY: Yes, I'm mad. I was worried about you. I called you four times before I went to sleep, okay? You didn't answer, no call back.
LOGAN: I'm sorry.
RORY: You're sorry?
LOGAN: Well, my phone was on "off." Which totally sounds like it's on, but it's not. It's on "off," which is on "off." On "off," got it?
RORY: I get it.
LOGAN: What, I'm not allowed to go out with my friends every once in a while? I work hard, okay? I, Life is hard. I just -- I need to…
RORY: You need to what?
LOGAN: I need to not be doing this right now, okay? You know what, forget the sandwich. I'm just gonna go to bed.
[Logan takes of his jacket and climbs into bed fully dressed]
RORY: [Sighs]
LUKE'S DINER
ZACH: So you're telling me you won't eat this oatmeal?
CUSTOMER: These are rolled oats repeatedly cut, twice steamed, and processed extensively.
ZACH: And the oatmeal you thought you were ordering was...
CUSTOMER: Steel cut, which are whole-grain oats, retaining the more natural, nutty flavor of the original oat kernels.
ZACH: Okay, okay. I think I got it. You're like an analog guy with a CD. You miss the vinyl's cool scratches and pops. I think I can work with that. [Goes to the counter. Too Luke] This dude over here wants to replace this with some sort of steel oatmeal.
LUKE: Tell him we've got it but it takes forever to cook, and then deliver those plates to table 5.
ZACH: I'm on it.
KIRK: Luke, check it out. I've been published.
LUKE: You have?
KIRK: Mother wanted to sell her dinette set, so I put pen to paper, got my creative juices flowing, and voil.
LUKE: You put a want ad in the stars hollow gazette?
KIRK: It's a powerful feeling seeing yourself immortalized in print. Sure, it's only newsprint. It rips easily, it comes off on your fingers, and the next day, people use it to wrap fish, but, hey, it's how Dickens got started.
LUKE: In want ads?
KIRK: Man, this thing really flows -- "Vintage dinette set, Formica, barely chipped, priced to move." It's precise, efficient, Hemingwayesque in its terse simplicity. [Too Zach] Hey, with two buns in the oven, you wouldn't be interested in a dinette set, would you? Seats four.
ZACH: No, thanks, man. Hey, Luke, you still haven't RSVP'ed for the baby shower.
LUKE: Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna go.
ZACH: Oh, really?
LUKE: Yeah, it's not my thing, you know? But there's a gift for you in the back. You should take it before you leave.
KIRK: Wait -- gifts are required?
ZACH: Oh yeah, that's kind of the whole point. I mean at least that's how Lane talked me into the whole thing.
KIRK: Damn. It's my first baby shower. I've been so caught up with the wardrobe question. Just to clarify, people don't actually dress like babies, do they?
[Luke looks up]
ZACH: I think what you're wearing is fine, dude. Luke, you should come.
LUKE: Yeah, thanks.
ZACH: Look, it's not gonna be too much of a rager -- real mellow vibe, and I promise not too much baby stuff. There won't be anything weird or q*eer about it at all.
LUKE: I'll think about it.
KIRK: Listen to this one -- "Does the spray of the open ocean call your name?" Evocative, huh? This guy can write. "Sturdy 15-foot fishing boat. Back-to-back seats, closed bow, meticulously handcrafted." How far out of town is 1211 Elmwood?
LUKE: 1211 Elmwood?
KIRK: That's what it says here.
LUKE: Let me see that. That's my boat!
KIRK: Really? How much are you asking? Because I wasn't looking for a boat, but that ad is so snappy, it makes me think I wouldn't mind owning one.
MRS KIM ANTIQUES
MRS KIM: So what's it going to be, yes or no?
CUSTOMER: Well I really like them. I'm just not sure how they're gonna work in the room.
MRS KIM: They will work they are teak. Teak is a hard working wood.
CUSTOMER: How about I take them out on memo?
MRS KIM: Memo?
CUSTOMER: You know. Bring them home, see how they look, if I like them, then I'll buy them.
MRS KIM: No I do not work with memos, I work with money. You buy them then and you take them home.
[Lorelai enters from the front door.]
CUSTOMER: What if they don't fit next to the bed.
MRS KIM: Then you get a new bed.
LORELAI: Hi Mrs Kim.
MRS KIM: Lorelai.
LORELAI: How's business?
MRS KIM: People die, go bankrupt, there is always furniture to sell.
LORELAI: Sounds good.
MRS KIM: You come for pictures of Lane?
LORELAI: Yeah.
MRS KIM: Here you are.
LORELAI: Thanks.
MRS KIM: [holding off handing them over] I am giving these to you in pristine condition and I expect that is how they will be returned. Do not cut them up or put glue on the back.
LORELAI: I will do my best. [Mrs Kim pulls them away from Lorelai's hand again] I will return them in the condition they were received. [She hand them over] See you at the show.
[Lorelai starts to leave]
MRS KIM: Ah, no you won't.
LORELAI: Why?
MRS KIM: I'm not going.
LORELAI: Not going to you daughters baby shower, why not?
MRS KIM: Lane knows why.
LORELAI: Oh there's a problem between you two?
MRS KIM: Yes.
LORELAI: Maybe you could put it aside for one day?
MRS KIM: No.
LORELAI: It's that bigger deal?
MRS KIM: Yes.
LORELAI: Well is there anything Lane can say or do that can change your mind?
MRS KIM: Yes.
LORELAI: Does Lane know what it is?
MRS KIM: Yes.
LORELAI: What do I have, like 14 questions left?
MRS KIM: I have work to do.
LORELAI: Mrs Kim, I know Lane would really like you to be at the shower.
MRS KIM: Well life is full of disappointments. You can show yourself out. [Too the customer] Too late you cannot buy those tables any more.
LORELAI: Okay then.
[Lorelai looks at the packet of pictures]
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT
[Lane opens the front door]
LORELAI AND LANE: [together] Hi!
LORELAI: Wow. Sorry, but, hoo! Wow.
LANE: I know every day, I think I can't possibly get any bigger, and then I do.
LORELAI: Hmm, It's looking homey in here.
LANE: Thanks. According to my book, I'm nesting. I hope it stops soon. It's sort of creeping me out. So, what's up?
LORELAI: Um, well, I wanted to talk to you about your mom.
LANE: Oh.
LORELAI: What happened with you guys?
LANE: Ask her.
LORELAI: No, no, no. I've already been through that. You tell me what happened.
LANE: We got in a fight. And now she says she's not coming to my baby shower. So, fine. She's not coming. I don't care.
LORELAI: Lane.
LANE: I don't. Why should I? She doesn't.
LORELAI: Of course she does.
LANE: Not more than she cares about fried shrimp.
LORELAI: You lost me there.
LANE: Well, last night, my mom was over. Zach had cut out an ad for the sea food festival Red Lobster. He was trying to figure out, if we went there after we had the babies, could we get the endless shrimp but at the kids' price?
LORELAI: No. You can only get the kids' price when accompanied by an adult paying full price.
LANE: That blows.
LORELAI: I know. So then what happened?
LANE: So then my mom sticks her nosy head in and said, "The children are not gonna be eating fried shrimp." And I said, "Not only are my children gonna be eating fried shrimp, they're gonna listen to whatever music they want and go to school dances, and they're not gonna spend their whole lives in church hearing about how doing all that makes them evil. In fact, they'll probably never set foot in a church at all. My kids are gonna have total freedom. End of story."
LORELAI: Total freedom, huh?
LANE: Yep.
LORELAI: You're just gonna let them follow their passion, no matter what it is?
LANE: Exactly.
LORELAI: What if you get kids who are passionate about religion? I mean you may have kids who want to study the bible.
LANE: Trust me -- my kids are not gonna want to study the bible.
LORELAI: You don't know what your kids are gonna want. You think your mom thought she was gonna get a kid who loved Jane's Addiction?
LANE: Well...
LORELAI: You might get kids who are nuts for Exodus, crazy for Deuteronomy, and then what? You want them hiding their bibles under the floorboards?
LANE: Well, look, if my kids want to go to bible study, they can go to bible study.
LORELAI: Well, see? And then what about church? If they want to go to church, you're not gonna let them, even at Christmas, when they have the manger you know and the petting zoo with the sheep and the donkeys?
LANE: Well, I might take them at Christmas.
LORELAI: Okay so when you say they're never going to church, you don't really mean they're never going to church.
LANE: Okay, not never, never, but mostly never.
LORELAI: Can't you tell your mom that?
LANE: No way.
LORELAI: Can I tell your mom that?
LANE: Okay, if you want, but tell her I am not bending on the shrimp thing.
LORELAI: Well I got you there Fried shrimp is one of the best things on the planet.
LANE: A double whammy -- unclean meat fried in unclean oil.
LORELAI: That doesn't sound as good, but look at it this way. For the first year, your kids probably won't be eating solid food anyway, and I don't think they make mashed fried shrimp.
LANE: So?
LORELAI: So, you could tell your mother that your kids will not eat fried shrimp for at least a year, right?
LANE: Well, technically.
LORELAI: "Technically" is good enough for me. You sit tight. I'll be back.
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Rory is dressed for her meeting, Logan is in bed asleep.]
RORY: [Sighs] It's after 12:00. Is anyone alive in there?
LOGAN: I'm alive, but I think my brain is dead.
RORY: I'll alert the transplant team.
LOGAN: You gave away my organs?
RORY: They're waiting on the roof with a cooler.
LOGAN: Ah-ha.
RORY: Take these.
[Hands Logan some aspirin and water]
LOGAN: I do will I wake up in a bathtub full of ice with no kidneys?
RORY: If you did, would you feel better or worse?
LOGAN: About the same.
RORY: Your dad's secretary called three times this morning.
LOGAN: Okay, now I feel worse.
RORY: Logan, what's going on?
LOGAN: Nothing.
RORY: You're not gonna call your dad back?
LOGAN: My head grew three sizes overnight. I'm in no condition to talk to anybody. Why are you so dressed up?
RORY: Coffee with the New York Times -- the whole reason why I stayed over last night.
LOGAN: Oh, yeah, that's right. That's today.
RORY: Yes, and Lane's baby shower. I'm gonna need you to be ready to leave for Stars Hollow the second I get back. We're gonna be cutting it really close. Lane's shower starts at 4:00. I should be back by 2:00 or 2:30 at the latest. Got it?
LOGAN: Got it.
RORY: Okay, I'll just come home, grab my outfit, and we'll go. I'm gonna need you to drive because I have to change in the backseat, "Dirty Dancing"-style. [Phone rings] Do you want me to get that?
LOGAN: Leave it.
RORY: If you don't want to get up, I can…
LOGAN: I said, "leave it." [small pause] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [Ringing continues]
RORY: I better go. I don't want to be late.
ANSWERING MACHINE: It's Logan. Leave a message. [Beep]
DORIS: [leaving a message] Hi, Logan. It's Doris from your father's office again. If you could just give us a call back here at the office as soon as you get this message.
LOGAN: [Groans]
DORIS: [continuing] I know you have the number, but just in case...
LIZ AND T.J.'S GARAGE
[T.J. opens the door, Liz and Luke are behind him.]
T.J.: ee? Look at it. It's just sitting here gathering dust and taking up space.
LIZ: Yeah if we got rid of the boat, we could turn this place into a workshop for my jewelry, and I really could use the space. Doula's gonna be crawling around soon, getting into everything.
T.J.: And jewelry-making's really a dangerous business, Luke. You got all those tiny beads -- choking hazards galore.
LIZ: Yeah, babies really like to put stuff in their mouth.
T.J.: They can't help it. They get mesmerized. I mean the little suckers look so much like candy or pistachio nuts, you just want to pop them in your mouth.
LIZ: Yeah, so as you can see, we could really use the space.
LUKE: So you were just gonna sell the boat out from under me.
LIZ: Of course not.
T.J.: We just figured we'd take an ad, get an offer, see what you say.
LIZ: Yeah, could be great, huh? I mean you get a little extra cash, we get a little extra space.
T.J.: Plus, we were thinking maybe you could invest some of the profits from the boat in Liz's business.
LIZ: If you felt like it was the right thing to do.
T.J.: But it does kind of make sense since we went through the trouble of selling the boat... and storing it. [Doula fusses on the baby monitor] Whoa. Doula alert. Not up yet -- just a squawk.
LUKE: [Sighs] Look, guys, I appreciate your situation here, but I'm not selling the boat. Dad left it to me. It's my boat. End of discussion.
LIZ: Luke.
LUKE: Hey, look, don't worry, all right? I'll find another place to store it.
LIZ: Like where?
LUKE: I don't know. I'll find a place, another place.
LIZ: What's the point of hanging on to it? You're never gonna use it.
LUKE: I might.
LIZ: You might. Dad might.
LUKE: What are you talking about?
LIZ: The boat. Dad spent like what 20 years working on the thing. You spent another 20.
LUKE: So?
LIZ: How many generations are gonna cart this thing around town? Look, get rid of it for your own sake, before you end up like dad.
LUKE: What does that mean?
LIZ: Oh, okay. Okay, forget it.
LUKE: No, I want to know. What does that mean?
LIZ: He was stuck, Luke.
LUKE: He was happy.
LIZ: He was stuck doing the same thing at the same time the same way every day of his life.
LUKE: So? He did the things that made him happy.
LIZ: Dad didn't do stuff 'cause it made him happy. He did stuff because he was afraid to do anything else.
LUKE: Come on, that's crap.
LIZ: Luke, I loved dad as much as you did.
LUKE: Look, he was good to us.
LIZ: Of course he was. I'm just saying sometimes a little change can be a good thing.
LUKE: My boat, my decision. I'm not selling it. All right?
LIZ: Okay.
LUKE: All right.
LIZ: Okay.
LUKE: I'll have it out of here by tomorrow.
LIZ: [Sighs]
STARS HOLLOW – STREET
[Lorelai walking past Westons, her cell phone rings]
LORELAI: Hello?
RORY: How bald do you have to be to be bald?
LORELAI: Is this a Zen call? You know I hate those.
RORY: Does it mean completely bald, or does it count if there's no hair on top but a little on the sides?
LORELAI: Well, in my experience, if a man describes himself as bald, there is nary a hair.
RORY: Nice use of "nary."
LORELAI: I'm trying to get you in the New York Times mood, use some fancy language.
RORY: Well, I will remember that if I can ever find the guy. Who knew New York was the bald-guy capital of the world?
LORELAI: Well I think that's on their license plate.
RORY: I'm telling you, they're everywhere, and since I don't know which one A.J. Is, every time one walks in the door, I just smile at him.
LORELAI: And let me guess -- they're all smiling back.
RORY: What's wrong with me? What kind of reporter am I going to be if all I got was "bald guy"?
LORELAI: Oh, relax. He knows what you look like, right?
RORY: I just hate this waiting you know. What should I do? Should I go order a coffee without him? Should I wait for him?
LORELAI: Order coffee. He won't mind.
RORY: Well, I can't, really. I'm at a table I don't even know if I should be sitting down already, but I walked in and it was really crowded, and this woman left her table, so I grabbed it, and now I'm scared to get up because maybe I'll lose it.
LORELAI: Keep the table, skip the coffee.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Yeah and when he gets there, go decaf.
RORY: Yeah, I know I'm a little nervous, but it's only because doing well at this meeting could mean the difference between interviewing world leaders and standing on street corners with pictures of celebrities in matching outfits asking passersby who wore it best.
LORELAI: Pretty high stakes.
RORY: I know. Distract me. How's the shower stuff going?
LORELAI: Um...
RORY: Oh, something's wrong!
LORELAI: No, nothing's wrong.
RORY: Oh, I knew it. My second pancake's gonna suck, too.
LORELAI: I've got it all under control. You just focus on finding the right bald guy.
RORY: Oh, another one just walked in.
LORELAI: Oh, head-to-hair ratio?
RORY: Very low. Stand by while I attempt to make eye contact.
LORELAI: Look at it this way -- you're making a lot of bald men feel very good about themselves today.
RORY: I better go.
LORELAI: Knock 'em dead, kid.
RORY: Oh, god.
MRS KIM ANTIQUES
MRS KIM: So, you're giving me a guarantee for Christmas and Easter.
LORELAI: As a minimum.
MRS KIM: And there will be a possibility of bible study and no unclean meats for at least a year. That's a start, at least.
LORELAI: So, do we have a deal?
MRS KIM: No, I never take first offer. This is what I want – attendance at weekly church services, bible study twice a week, Adventist summer camp, no unclean meats or hydrogenated oils, Christmas will be celebrated with no gifts, and there will be no sandboxes or parties with pony rides.
LORELAI: What's wrong with ponies?
MRS KIM: Flies buzzing around, carrying infectious diseases.
LORELAI: Alright no infected ponies, fine. But sandboxes? I mean, come on. Kids play, they go to the park. You have to be reasonable.
MRS KIM: It is not reasonable for Lane to think that she will raise my grandchildren as heathens while I stand by and do nothing.
LORELAI: I understand, Mrs. Kim. It's a really sensitive subject.
MRS KIM: No, you don't. Your daughter doesn't reject everything you stand for.
LORELAI: But Lane is not rejecting you. You guys are just different. God knows my mother and I had differences.
MRS KIM: Yes. God does know.
LORELAI: Look...there are times when you have to put those differences aside. Like, you know Joseph, from the bible, and how his brothers got all mad at him about that dreamcoat. Yes, and so they sold him into slavery.
LORELAI: Yeah. I don't think that was in the musical. The point is there are fights you can recover from and fights you can't, and not going to your daughter's baby shower -- I mean, I know it's hard, but I don't want you to draw a line in the sand now that you can't cross later. My mother missed so much. I don't want that to happen to you.
[They smile at each other]



LUKE'S APARTMENT
[Luke is on the couch and dials the phone]
APRIL: Hello?
LUKE: Hey.
APRIL: Hey, dad.
LUKE: How was swim practice?
APRIL: Drills, drills, drills. Coach Scott made us swim with our fists closed.
LUKE: What does that do?
APRIL: Probably nothing -- just looks funny. Oh I did get to work on my backward racing start.
LUKE: How'd that go?
APRIL: Not so good. I think I ended up with half the pool up my nose.
LUKE: Eh, you'll get better.
APRIL: Can't get much worse.
LUKE: So, how's your mom doing?
APRIL: Good. Little stressed about the new store. She likes the space, but she's not sure about the location. Strip malls bum her out. So what's going on?
LUKE: Nothing. You know, business as usual. I saw your cousin Doula today. She looks good. She's getting bigger.
APRIL: You promised you'd send me new pictures.
LUKE: I will. I will. So, look, I was thinking about this summer when you come to visit.
APRIL: I can't wait.
LUKE: Yeah, me too. So, I was thinking maybe we should take a trip.
APRIL: A trip?
LUKE: Yeah, a big one, you know? I mean you're gonna be here for what like six weeks, right? So maybe we should just take off.
APRIL: And go where?
LUKE: You know, I don't know. I was thinking Florida.
APRIL: Florida?
LUKE: Yeah, you know, go down to [emphasizing] Disneyworld.
APRIL: You want to go to Disneyworld?
LUKE: Yeah. You know you've never been there. I've never been there. We could fly down to Florida and check out Miami Beach and then go to...[emphasizing] Disneyworld.
APRIL: I-I can't imagine you at Disneyworld -- or at the beach, for that matter.
LUKE: W-why not?
APRIL: I don't know -- riding roller coasters, getting your picture taken with Mickey Mouse. I'm just having trouble picturing it.
LUKE: Yeah, well...
APRIL: Look, dad, you don't have to do this. It's okay. I mean I'm looking forward to the summer and all, but it's not like I'm expecting anything.
LUKE: Oh, no, sure.
APRIL: I mean, I'm fine just hanging out at the diner like we always do -- wipe down tables, refill salt and pepper shakers. It's our thing. Really, honestly, it's fine.
LUKE: Uh...oh, okay.
APRIL: Oh, mom wants to talk to you real quick about some travel stuff for my spring break. But don't hang up, 'cause I want to read you something I wrote.
LUKE: Oh, yeah?
APRIL: We had to write a five-page fictional story featuring someone we know as the hero, and I chose Kirk. It's hilarious. I'll give you to mom, and I'll get the story.
LUKE: Okay, great.
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT
[Lane opens the front door, Lorelai and Mrs Kim are standing there.]
LORELAI: Hi. Can we come in?
LANE: Sure. Whatever.
LORELAI: Isn't that nice? So great. Okay. [they sit down] Here we go. So...
MRS KIM: So.
LANE: So, what?
LORELAI: Your mother has something she'd like to say to you.
MRS KIM: You say it.
LORELAI: Me? Um...you'll jump in? Okay. Uh, Lane, um... your mother realizes that the two of you have differences. She might not always agree with all of your decisions.
MRS KIM: No "might." She doesn't agree.
LANE: I know. You've made yourself perfectly clear.
LORELAI: Lane.
LANE: Sorry. Go on.
LORELAI: She doesn't agree with all your decisions. However, she knows how much you love and respect her. Don't you, Lane?
LANE: Of course I do.
LORELAI: And she'd very much like to come to your shower.
LANE: Really?
LORELAI: Really.
LANE: [getting up] Thank you, mom. Oh!
MRS KIM: Lane?
LORELAI: You okay?
LANE: I think so.
MRS KIM: What's wrong? Are you going into labor?
LANE: I don't know. I've never been in labor before.
LORELAI: You might have had a contraction. We'll wait and see if you have another…
MRS KIM: There will be no waiting. You will drive us to the hospital right now. Hurry, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Okay.
MRS KIM: Careful, Lane. Wait. I'll get it. [opens the door]
LORELAI: Uh, well, okay.
MRS KIM: Careful
LORELAI: You got it. All right. Here we go.
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM
[Lane is in bed with Zach next to her, Lorelai and Mrs Kim are tucking her in.]
LANE: I can't believe I'm on bed rest. This sucks.
LORELAI: Oh, come on, haven't you ever had one of those lazy Sundays where you stay in bed all day? Just think of this as one long lazy Sunday.
ZACH: Yeah baby, plus you get to eat all your meals on trays, that's pretty cool. And I'm gonna hang out with you, just like John and Yoko.
LANE: This is your fault.
MRS KIM: Mine? [Too Lorelai] See what I deal with?
LORELAI: Lane.
LANE: We shouldn't have gone to the hospital.
MRS KIM: Better I watch my daughter writhe in pain?
LANE: I wasn't writhing. Lorelai, tell her I wasn't writhing.
LORELAI: You know does it really matter who was or wasn't writhing? I mean your mom was worried about you.
LANE: Yeah, right. She's probably happy.
MRS KIM: Why would I be happy?
LANE: Because now I can't have my party.
MRS KIM: Lane Van Gerbig, what is wrong with you? Parties are not the most important thing in life.
LANE: I know.
MRS KIM: Do you?
LANE: Of course. It's just that this one is my last.
LORELAI: Why is it your last?
LANE: I'm about to be a mother.
LORELAI: Um, mothers can have parties.
LANE: Not for themselves. They only do things for their children. She did everything for me. And...I'm... gonna be the same way.
MRS KIM: You will have the party.
LANE: How?
MRS KIM: Uh...Lorelai will figure something out.
ZACH: Cool!
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
RORY: Hello. I'm home.
LORELAI: Hey. How'd it go?
RORY: Awesome. Logan! You're not dressed! It's 2:30. You were supposed to be dressed and ready.
LOGAN: I'm dressed.
RORY: But not for Lane's shower. Come on, get up. Let's go.
LOGAN: Wait, wait. Sit down. Tell me how it went.
RORY: I'll tell you on the way. Come on.
LOGAN: Wait. Sit down. I have to tell you something.
RORY: Well, that doesn't sound so good.
LOGAN: It's not. Look, I screwed up, okay? Big-time.
RORY: What's going on?
LOGAN: The company I bought, the new business I was trying to start? It's a bust.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: We're going belly-up because of me. I lost everybody's money -- my money, my dad's money, all our investors' money, the parking-lot attendant's money, the hot-dog vendor's money. I lost money I didn't even know I had.
RORY: Logan, be serious.
LOGAN: I am.
RORY: Well...if you are, then back up a step. Explain this to me.
LOGAN: There's nothing to explain. The second we bought this company, all these lawsuits came out of the woodwork.
RORY: So…
LOGAN: So one of them has merit, which means we're screwed -- no money, no jobs, no nothing.
RORY: Um... I don't understand. How long have you known about this?
LOGAN: Weeks.
RORY: Weeks? Why didn't you say something about it to me?
LOGAN: I don't know. I thought maybe I could fix it, you know? I was looking for loopholes.
RORY: Well, you can keep looking. You'll find one.
LOGAN: No, we can't. Look, it's over. Philip and I got the final call last night from our patent lawyers. Their case is solid. There's nothing we can do but settle. I screwed up, okay? I rushed in. I didn't do my research. It's all my fault.
RORY: Well, I'm sure that's not true. I'm sure there's something…
LOGAN: Rory, you're not getting this. This is huge. This isn't something you can fix with a plucky, good attitude and a can-do spirit.
RORY: Well, I'm just trying to help.
LOGAN: I know.
RORY: Well, what about your dad? What's he say about all this?
LOGAN: I haven't talked to him.
RORY: Logan, you're gonna have to talk to him.
LOGAN: Rory, don't give me any grief about this. Any minute now, Mitchum is gonna be busting through that door chomping at the bit to tell me what a gigantic failure I am.
RORY: God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry about all this.
LOGAN: I know you are.
RORY: Well, you'll get through it. We'll get through it. I mean, whatever happens, we'll figure it out together.
LOGAN: Sure. And I'm sorry about today. I just can't deal with a baby shower.
RORY: No, I know. I get it. I mean the minute it's over, I will come back, and I'll bring cake.
LOGAN: You don't have to hurry.
RORY: I want to.
LOGAN: No it's cool, don't worry about it. I'm not gonna be here.
RORY: You're going out?
LOGAN: I'm gonna go to Vegas with Colin and Finn.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: Yeah I just need to blow off steam for a couple days.
RORY: With Colin and Finn.
LOGAN: It's perfect timing. Colin's got his dad's jet all gassed up at Teterboro. I'm gonna meet him in an hour.
RORY: To go to Vegas with Colin and Finn.
LOGAN: Yeah. Finn bought a racehorse with George Maloof. How hilarious is that? I'm gonna go take a shower.
RORY: Um are you kidding me? This is really what you want to do?
LOGAN: I just need a break, okay? [he kisses Rory in the cheek] Tell Lane I said congrats.
LUKE'S DINER
[Kirk enters]
KIRK: Word on the street is you want to sell your boat.
LUKE: I called you Kirk.
KIRK: Yeah but I was on the street what I got that call and to be honest with you, I was a little surprised to hear about this turn of events.
[They start walking out to the boat.]
LUKE: It's not a turn of events Kirk. I just want to sell my boat.
KIRK: But you've always been really attached to this boat. Hell I thought you'd take it to your grave with you, maybe you'd row yourself across the River Styx.
LUKE: Yeah well turns out I'm not using it, you interested?
KIRK: [Kicking the trailer tires] It does suit me and it would be great for water skiing. Lulu loves water skiing. She also loves carriage rides. You're not selling a carriage are you?
LUKE: Just the boat Kirk.
KIRK: Hmmm.
LUKE: You interested or not?
KIRK: How much we talking?
LUKE: $600.
KIRK: I was thinking more around three.
LUKE: Price isn't negotiable.
KIRK: Okay 400.
LUKE: Non negotiable $600 price includes everything Kirk, even the trailer.
KIRK: 590.
LUKE: $600, Kirk.
KIRK: 595 and you throw in a life preserver and a captain's hat?
LUKE: 600 and you buy your own captain's hat.
KIRK: But you'll throw in a life preserver?
LUKE: Deal. Just have it out of here A.S.A.P.
[Luke goes back in the diner]
KIRK: Sucker.
MISS PATTY'S
[They are setting up for the baby shower]
LORELAI: Oh, plates and cups right by the food. Art supplies over at the onesies table. Thanks. Hey, Sookie, I forget -- are these edible or soap?
SOOKIE: Soap.
LORELAI: Hmmm. Oh, this is a party favor -- not near the candy pacifiers.
BABETTE: Sugar, what do you think? Is it straight?
LORELAI: It looks great. Patty, how are you doing?
MISS PATTY: Adorable. There is nothing cuter than a baby in a onesie -- except, of course, Anthony Quinn in a onesie.
LORELAI: I'll take your word for it.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Hey! How'd it go?
RORY: Why did the baby shower get moved to miss patty's?
LORELAI: Oh, it's a long story. Now tell me about the meeting.
RORY: It was great. It was, it was so great. But what's going on here?
LORELAI: Okay "Great's" not gonna do it. I need big, juicy details. All right, Lane had contractions. She went to the hospital, but it was a false alarm. She's okay. She is on bed rest.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I know. But now, tell me, from the moment that the right bald guy smiled at you -- and walk.
RORY: Why are we going?
LORELAI: How are your shoes?
RORY: My shoes?
LORELAI: Good arch support? Good traction? Good.
RORY: What?
STARS HOLLOW STREET
[Lane is in her bed and it is being pushed down the street but Lorelai, Rory, Zach and Mrs Kim. They are going past Luke's.]
MRS KIM: Slow down. [to a car] Hold it! Hold it. Too fast.
LANE: Mom, I'm fine. Hey, this is fun. Don't they push a bed through the streets in the opening credits of "The Monkees"?
ZACH: I'm pretty sure it was a bathtub.
LORELAI: Actually it was both -- Davy's in the bed. Peter's in the bathtub.
ZACH: Are you sure? 'Cause I could have sworn…
RORY: Oh Zach, you don't want to go head-to-head with her about "Monkees" trivia.
MRS KIM: [too a car driver] You did not come to a full stop! And use your blinkers!
ZACH: Okay, we're turning around.
ALL OF THEM: Okay, hold on, Lane!
MRS KIM: Hold on. Are you ready? Here we go. Hold tight. You all right?
[They push the bed backwards up a ramp going over the front steps into Miss Patty's]
LANE: Yep. I'm good.
MISS PATTY'S
[They baby shower is underway, Rachel Sweet's "b-a-b-y" is playing]
MUSIC: Baby oh, baby I love to call you baby baby oh, my baby I love for you to call me baby, when it's sweet…
LORELAI: Looking good. You done there, Patty?
MISS PATTY: I'm done. How you doing, hon?
LORELAI: Oh, doing great.
MISS PATTY: Yeah? I mean about the whole Christopher thing.
[Babette, Lulu and Gypsy look up from the onesies table]
LORELAI: Oh, um...fine, you know, moving forward, moving on.
MISS PATTY: Good.
BABETTE: If you ask me, Gil's the one to b*at.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I saw him do that whole thing freehand.
LULU: [gushing] He's an amazing man. [Seriously] As is Kirk.
LORELAI: Don't worry, Lulu. It's the rock-star thing.
MISS PATTY: Dean martin singing "Mambo Italiano" -- I will never forget it.
GYPSY: Oh, great. I need another one.
LORELAI: Oh, no, no. What are you doing? Well, I was trying to make a little truck, but the flatbed kept running around to the back.
LORELAI: Well, no do-overs, so just turn that into something else.
BABETTE: Yeah I tried to make Snoopy -- figured he's easy to draw, and what kid doesn't like Snoopy, right? Plus, as the added bonus, he's black-and-white, and the onesie's already white, so I only got to add the black. But it's looking more like a chocolate-chip cookie, a big one -- which is okay, 'cause what kid doesn't like a cookie?
GYPSY: What am I supposed to turn this into?
BABETTE: I don't know -- a blob?
LORELAI: Make it a bunch of blobs – you know, a baby's first Rorschach test.
MISS PATTY: Oh, yeah. I see a ballerina about to take flight.
BABETTE: I see cheese.
LORELAI: See? Something for everyone. All right, have fun.
GIL: [looking at a picture] Whoa! This one's homely, man. Look it's got Zach's giant ears and Lane's glasses. I feel for that kid. Gonna have a rough life. But it will probably help to fuel his music. You know, you got to feel pain to create the really good stuff. Yeah, this one's gonna get the chicks, but that one's gonna be the genius.
BRIAN: You know these aren't what Lane and Zach's kids are really gonna look like. It's one of those computer morphing programs.
GIL: Yeah, dude. I have kids. I know how it works.
LANE: Thanks for coming.
GIL: Yo, hello. What's up, guys?
[Rory stands on a chair near the bed.]
RORY: Hi, everyone. Um I don't want to interrupt the fun. I just wanted to say thank you for coming to this somewhat unconventional baby shower, which is actually perfect, because when do Lane and Zach ever do anything that's conventional?
[Cheers and applause]
RORY: I've known Lane now for -- what has it been? 17 years?
LANE: Yeah.
RORY: And...I'm just sick of her already.
[Laughter]
RORY: No, actually, I just love you and Zach so much, and I just can't wait to meet those boys. So thank you so much for coming. Keep having fun. And just eat, drink, and keep decorating those onesies. [Hops of the chair]
[Cheers and applause]
ZACH: Thanks, Rory. This party rocks.
RORY: Ah, it's all due to my mom, though. I planned, she executed.
ZACH: Well, you both rock.
RORY: Well, how often does a girl's best friend have twins?
LANE: Just once, let's hope.
ZACH: Yeah, no kidding. You want a drink, babe?
LANE: Maybe a lemonade.
ZACH: Coming right up.
LANE: Seriously, Zach's right. This party is amazing. Everything you guys did -- truthfully, I didn't think it was actually gonna happen.
RORY: Yes well, that whole bed-rest thing really threw a wrench in.
LANE: Plus the fight.
RORY: What fight?
LANE: You didn't hear about the fight? Me and my mum, classic Kim family grudgefest? If not for your mom, we might have gone the way of Pretty Girls Make Graves. They were so young and had so many k*ll albums left in them.
RORY: So my mom brokered peace?
LANE: Hard-core. Listen... here's the thing. Um...my kids are gonna need that, too -- you know, when they're hiding bibles and they can't stand me. So what I wanted to know is... would you be their Lorelai Gilmore? I guess that's the proper term.
RORY: Real?
LANE: I can't think of anyone who would be better. Plus, you already have the name.
RORY: I'd love to. Yeah. Thanks.
[Lorelai looks on as Lane and Rory hug.]
MRS KIM: Here.
LORELAI: Hi, Mrs. Kim. What's this?
MRS KIM: Open it.
LORELAI: It's a doorknob.
MRS KIM: Not just any doorknob -- John Adams' doorknob. You are familiar with our second president, I assume?
LORELAI: Not personally.
MRS KIM: You're making a joke?
LORELAI: Little one.
MRS KIM: That's what I thought. Anyway, I'm glad to be here, and I wanted you to know that.
LORELAI: Hence the doorknob.
MRS KIM: Yes.
LORELAI: Thank you.
MRS KIM: Don't tarnish it, or its value will decrease.
LORELAI: Okay.
MRS KIM: Do you have my pictures?
LORELAI: I-I-I left them at home. I'll drop them off tomorrow.
MRS KIM: You do that.
[At the present table]
LORELAI: Hey, you guys.
JACKSON: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey, you. Way to go. It's a great party.
LORELAI: It is, right? I could have used another gift table, though.
JACKSON: Yeah, somebody went crazy.
SOOKIE: I wouldn't say "crazy."
JACKSON: Wait -- that's all from us?
SOOKIE: Well, I felt bad. I had already promised them all of our old stuff from Martha and Davey, and then I had to renege.
JACKSON: So they get all new stuff, and we have to keep all the crappy hand-me-downs? How does that make any sense?!
SOOKIE: [Rubbing her belly] Whose fault is this, huh?
LORELAI: Nice talking to you. See you later.
KIRK: Ahoy, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Yeah, Kirk. What's with the hat?
KIRK: Oh, this? No big deal. Just bought myself a boat.
LORELAI: A boat?
KIRK: Yeah, the S.S. Lurk. It's a combination of my name and Luke's since it used to be his boat.
LORELAI: Oh, you bought Luke's boat.
KIRK: Yeah, she needs a little more work before she's seaworthy, but as soon as she is, I'll take you out. You can be Ginger to Lulu's Mary Ann. Let's lock down dates now. When are you free?
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Oh, well, we'll figure it out later. Bye.
[Kirk salutes goodbye]
MISS PATTY'S - EXTERIOR
[Lorelai and Rory put on coats as they exit]
LORELAI: Perfect timing. You save me from a three-hour tour of the S.S. Lurk.
RORY: The what?
LORELAI: Ah Kirk bought Luke's old boat.
RORY: Does he even have a driver's license?
LORELAI: I don't think so.
RORY: Well, I'm staying out of the water.
LORELAI: Good kid.
RORY: [Giggle] Why didn't you tell me about the whole drama with Mrs. Kim?
LORELAI: Honey you had your meeting. You were nervous enough already.
RORY: Yeah, I was, wasn't I? Oh you got the whole brunt of that freak-out. I'm so sorry.
LORELAI: That's okay. So do you think it went well?
RORY: I do I think it went really well. I mean, the Reston fellowship is a long sh*t. They only pick four people out of the whole country, and that's including college seniors and graduate students. So?
LORELAI: So you and three other people.
RORY: Yeah, but can you imagine it? I would be an intern at the New York Times. I would be up for bi-lines.
LORELAI: I can imagine it.
RORY: Well I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just not even gonna think about it.
LORELAI: Can I think about it?
RORY: Yes, but not around me.
LORELAI: Deal. So, when is Logan getting here?
RORY: Oh. He's not.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Um...it's a long story. I guess there was this huge disaster at his work.
LORELAI: Oh, no.
RORY: Yeah, I guess the company he bought is being sued, and he's losing all kinds of money -- not only his own money, his dad's money. It's awful, and he feels awful. At least that explains why he's acting awful.
LORELAI: What do you mean?
RORY: Well, right now, he's on a private jet to Vegas with Colin and Finn.
LORELAI: Ahh, "Got kicked out of Argentina with the Bush twins" Colin and Finn? I'm so sorry. You okay?
RORY: Yeah, I'm fine. I mean I just kinda wish that he'd told me about this earlier, you know that I'd known it was going on. Maybe I could have helped.
LORELAI: Honey I don't think there's anything you could have done.
RORY: Yeah, I know, but maybe I could have tried, you know? And now he just took off, which -- I get it. He needs to blow off some steam, but I just wish he could have come to the party. It would have meant so much. He could have met everyone.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: But I'm sure we'll figure it out. Oh, hey, Lane asked me to be her Lorelai Gilmore to her kids, like you were to her.
LORELAI: Oh!
RORY: Yeah. Big shoes to fill.
LORELAI: Well, luckily, we have similar feet.
RORY: [giggles]
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Oh, it's nothing.
RORY: Come on.
LORELAI: I just think my first pancake turned out pretty darn good.
[They smile and giggle]
ZACH: Hey. Sorry to interrupt.
LORELAI: That's all right.
ZACH: I was just wondering if we should bring the cake out now, because Lane's got that low-blood-sugar look in her eye.
RORY: Oh, yeah, let's do it.
[Zach and Rory go back inside, Lorelai looks at the picture collage near the door.]
LUKE: Seems like yesterday she was taking up three tables at the diner with those giant books of hers.
LORELAI: Hmm.
LUKE: Yep. She was something. Is something.
LORELAI: So, uh, what's this I hear about Kirk buying your boat?
LUKE: Oh, well... I just realized I was never gonna take that thing out. I mean, all that time I spent trying to fix it up... so I bought a new one.
LORELAI: Wha, Ah, When?
LUKE: Today -- got the idea in my head a couple hours ago, went down to the shipyard in Bridgeport, and just did it.
LORELAI: You just bought a boat.
LUKE: Yeah, yeah and it's even bigger and better than the old one. I mean it's got everything. It's got a little kitchen, a bathroom, even a place to sleep.
LORELAI: Wow.
LUKE: I'm just gonna keep it in the marina you know, And then when April comes to visit in the summer, you know I'll take it out on little trips, you know go away for a few weeks.
LORELAI: Luke, that sounds really nice.
LUKE: Right?
LORELAI: God, I can't believe you bought a boat in a day. It used to take you a week to buy a t-shirt.
LUKE: Yeah, well, things change.
[Tey look at each other for a few seconds]
LUKE: I'll see you inside?
LORELAI: Mm-hmm.
[Luke goes in, followed by Lorelai a few seconds later.]
RORY: All right, everyone, here comes cake!
ZACH: Ready, fellas. One, two, three, four...
SINGING: [Gil on guitar] Hush, little baby, don't say a word papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird and if that mockingbird don't sing papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring and if that diamond ring turns brass papa's gonna buy you a looking glass and if that looking glass gets broke papa's gonna buy you a billy goat and if that billy goat won't pull…
[Lorelai smiles as she looks at the singing.]

BOUTIQUE CHANGING ROOM
[Lorelai and Rory shopping for an interview suit for Rory]
LORELAI: Oh, Moonpies.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: It's a wonderful part of a road trip, the stopping for Moonpies.
RORY: Mom, I want to go. I can't.
LORELAI: I know. I know. End of semester -- lots of work.
RORY: Not lots -- tons. I'm sorry.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. It's just…
RORY: What "it's just"?
LORELAI: Well, it's just, you know, a shame to miss the wedding of a woman who meant so much to you.
RORY: Mom, I talked to Mia. I apologized profusely. I told her it was simply impossible for me to drop everything right now and go to North Carolina. [about the outfit] No, right?
LORELAI: No.
RORY: Yeah. She totally understood.
LORELAI: Well, of course, she understood. She understood when I was 17 and I arrived at the inn, holding a little, tiny baby in my arms, and rain was pouring down.
RORY: As long as you're not milking this.
LORELAI: And she understood when you broke that teacup of hers, what was that the Wnglish rose pattern when you were 4.
RORY: Okay, mom.
LORELAI: Yeah, I think that was an antique, wasn't it? But, oh, she understood.
RORY: Hello. Statute of limitations.
LORELAI: You know why? Because she is an understanding, kind, and loving woman who loves you. That's cute.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: I don't know if "cute" is what I'm going for on an interview for a newspaper, but.
LORELAI: Worked for Brenda Starr. Worked for Lois Lane.
RORY: Ah so if I get a job as a journalist in a comic strip, this is the one.
LORELAI: Oh, do you remember when we used to do road trips you know when you were little, and we'd play "I spy"?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: And you'd say, "I spy something with four wheels." And I'd be like, "is it a cow?" Dah, 'Cause that's funny and fun.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Road trips are so fun.
RORY: They are, but I don't feel like I can go, especially with Logan freaking out on me. I mean he's running off to Vegas, coming home drunk, giving me attitude, not calling his dad back.
LORELAI: Still?
RORY: Yes, and while I'm mad at him, because he's acting this way, I just feel like maybe he's really going through something and I should be there for him.
LORELAI: Oh, honey, I get it. I really do. You know, I want to take back the "cute." That's really growing on me. It's very you.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Yeah, it's very grown-up. It reeks of gravitas. It screams New York Times.
RORY: Well, I need it to say more than that. I mean I'm hoping to hear from The San Francisco Chronicle, The Seattle Times, The Detroit Free Press.
LORELAI: Well honey, you can't ask one suit to say so much. You know why don't you just get the suit that says something local?
RORY: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: 'Cause you know those other cities are so far away, so expensive, so tiring.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: And plus you can get a good cup of coffee in New York. I don't know about those other cities. They have crappy crappy coffee.
RORY: You mean like Seattle?
LORELAI: Mm-hmm. Oh! Waffle ranch.
RORY: Missing the connection.
LORELAI: Gosh, I drove through North Carolina once, and they have the most wonderful chain called "Waffle Ranch."
RORY: Mum, it's not so much about the road-trip food.
LORELAI: Waffle ranch kicks IHOP'S butt.
RORY: Hey how come you weren't so desperate to have me come along when we got the invitation, two months ago?
LORELAI: Well because two months ago, I knew you would play the homework card, so I planned to do this with your dad -- just him and me.
RORY: Oh, I'm sorry.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Are you sorry enough to make it up to me by going with me?
RORY: I really wish I could.
LORELAI: Oh. Hey, that's a winner.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Yeah, I really think you could stun them in any newspaper interview.
RORY: It is a stunning suit, isn't it?
LORELAI: Yep, it sure is. You know they might like you so much that they take your picture and put it in the insert for the Macy's one day sale.
RORY: You really like it?
LORELAI: I really do. But you shouldn't take my word for it. You need a group, a consensus. And you know where there would be a great group at Mia's wedding.
RORY: Nice try.
LORELAI: Oh, god.
OPENING CREDITS
LOGAN'S APARTMENT
[Logan is sitting at the computer (a Mac by the way)]
RORY: Hey, you're up.
LOGAN: The shower woke me.
RORY: Sorry. I'm heading to the library. I have a ton of reading to catch up on. So I thought I'd get an early start.
LOGAN: Cool.
RORY: You doing some work?
LOGAN: No, just looking for something on YouTube. [Chuckles] You got to see this. Finn posted a little video he sh*t on his cell phone when we were in Vegas. It's pretty outrageous.
RORY: You going in to the office today?
LOGAN: I doubt it. Colin and Finn are coming over.
RORY: What are you guys gonna do?
LOGAN: Hang, probably.
RORY: You know, Logan, I think after the library, I'm gonna catch a train back to new Haven.
LOGAN: Good enough.
[Knock on door, Rory answers it]
RORY: Oh, hi.
MITCHUM: Rory.
RORY: Um, Logan's...
[Mitchum walks in and picks up the phone.]
MITCHUM: So, it does work. And I can assume you can get cell phone reception wherever the hell you've been.
LOGAN: I was gonna call.
MITCHUM: Uh-huh.
LOGAN: I was just waiting until I figured out my next move.
MITCHUM: Next move. I'm fascinated. What is this next move?
LOGAN: I…
MITCHUM: And where were you figuring it out -- by the pool, the slot machines?
LOGAN: What you've been spying on me?
MITCHUM: After what you pulled, you can pretty much bet I'm gonna be spying on you for the rest of your life.
LOGAN: I need some time.
MITCHUM: You know what you need, Logan? You need to get dressed, get cleaned up, and get your ass down to the office so you can hear what's been figured out for you!
LOGAN: I'm not just another one of your employees.
MITCHUM: Damn right you're not. If you were just another one of my employees, you'd be fired by now. Steven, Barry in legal are gonna sit you down, try and sort out the mess you made. Can you be there in an hour?
[Mitchum leaves]
RORY: [Puts her hands on her head and sighs]
LOGAN: And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen. Mitchum Huntzberger, class-a jerk. Can you believe him?
RORY: No. I mean...
LOGAN: What?
RORY: He was a jerk. He is a jerk.
LOGAN: But?
RORY: Uh, well, Logan, far be it for me to agree with your father, but you have been kind of irresponsible.
LOGAN: Okay, you know what, I can't…This is really weird.
RORY: What -- that I'm being honest?
LOGAN: No, that you're on his side. I kind of expected a little support here.
RORY: Logan, I love you, but I'm not gonna support every stupid thing that you do, okay? If you go rob a bank, what do you expect me to do? Say, "oh, that's okay, honey. I support you darling"?
LOGAN: I screwed up. I admit it. What do you people want -- a friggin pound of flesh?
RORY: What -- "you people"? Logan, for me, it's not that your business deal got messed up. Okay It's what you've done since then.
LOGAN: What have I done?
RORY: Nothing -- that's exactly my point. I mean you've not been facing the problem. You've been running from it.
LOGAN: I was going crazy, Rory. I had to blow off steam. I'm trying to get my bearings here.
RORY: I don't see you trying to get your bearings. I see you hiding out, and people are counting on you, your dad included. And you're not facing your responsibilities. You're -- you are being a jerk.
LOGAN: Well, maybe that's who I am. Maybe I'm a jerk like my dad. You ever think of that?
RORY: I'm starting to.
[Rory leaves and Logan goes back to his computer]
LUKE'S DINER
ZACH: I highly recommend the cream of wheat today, ma'am. I don't know what it's spiked with, but it's like insane. [goes to Luke] We got a truckload of that cream of wheat back there, so I'm pushing it like crazy.
LUKE: You're one sly waiter, Zach.
KIRK: Not so fast. Got a little snafu with my order.
ZACH: I don't see a snafu.
KIRK: And that is why Lane is the pro at this job, and you will always be the amateur.
ZACH: Dude I don't have a problem with that. What's wrong with your order?
KIRK: Grilled-cheese platter comes with French fries and pickles.
ZACH: Which I'm looking at.
KIRK: Look a little closer, my friend, and you'll see that the juice from the pickles has leached over to the grilled cheese, rendering it sodden and inedible.
ZACH: Well --
KIRK: I don't recall ordering grilled cheese "au jus".
ZACH: Pickles have juice, dude. It's like a main law of nature.
KIRK: Ah, but that's where Lane knew how to prevent this culinary catastrophe. Prior to serving the dish, she would use the French fries to build a tiny dam…
ZACH: Dude, I get it.
LUKE: It's all going to the same place inside that dark, strange body of yours, Kirk. Now eat it.
ZACH: Lane's right. You rock as a boss.
LUKE: Yeah. How's she doing?
ZACH: Oh dude she is about ready to burst.
LUKE: Oh, yeah?
ZACH: Yeah she's like a giant piñata, just waiting for some kid to take a mallet to her stomach and free the goodies inside.
LUKE: I'm thinking a doctor might be a better way to go.
ZACH: Oh, hey, I almost forgot. Lane and I would like to have you over for dinner.
LUKE: Oh, yeah, that sounds great. We should do that.
ZACH: Great. So, how's tomorrow, 8:30?
LUKE: Tomorrow? I don't know.
ZACH: Okay here's the thing -- Lane asked me to ask you about tomorrow a long time ago, and I kind of forgot, so she'd be mad if you canceled last minute.
LUKE: I'm not canceling -- I haven't accepted.
ZACH: Well let's not get into semantics. It would just be a bummer if you bailed. ‘Cause she's been cooking for like two days.
LUKE: [looking please] Okay, yeah, tomorrow night -- that sounds fine.
ZACH: Great! And I hope you like curry, 'cause Lane's gone curry crazy.
LUKE: I'm not big on curry.
ZACH: Oh, well, maybe you can pick around it.
GILMORE MANSION – RICHARDS OFFICE
[Lorelai and Emily at the computer]
LORELAI: It's the same program as the one we used for that corporate stuff you know but a different application. ‘Cause it's personal. It's simple.
EMILY: For you, maybe. I couldn't figure it out. And your father was absolutely no help.
LORELAI: Well, all we need to do is -- mom, you're doing it again.
EMILY: I'm looking at the screen.
LORELAI: I know, but you're, like, hovering.
EMILY: I'm not hovering, Lorelai. "Hovering" means you're elevated off the ground. Do I look like I'm elevating?
LORELAI: You seem awful tense, mom.
EMILY: Of course I'm tense. Having your father around the house all the time is extremely difficult. He's just there, wandering about, like a man of leisure.
LORELAI: Did he go through any of this stuff? Did he at least sign the 1040?
EMILY: I don't know.
LORELAI: Oh mum he has to sign some of this stuff before we can send it out you know.
EMILY: He refuses to deal with anything. All he does is watch golf, pad around in his sweatsuit, and annoy me with questions about things he's misplaced. And he's getting to be a serious pain in the you-know-what.
LORELAI: The nose? The ear?
EMILY: Would it give you that much pleasure to hear me say "ass"?
LORELAI: I wasn't sure, but, yes, it did.
RICHARD: Emily! Have you seen my -- oh, hello, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hi, dad. Nice threads. Having lunch with Tony Soprano?
EMILY: Don't encourage him.
RICHARD: You like it? I realized that, since I was housebound, I might as well wear whatever I like. These are so comfy. Have either of you seen my putter?
LORELAI: No, but we have seen this 1040 tax form. Sign it.
RICHARD: Did your mother tell you I've installed a putting green in the back yard? It's great fun.
EMILY: You are not going out to putt. You'll catch your death. And, Richard, would you please sign this form?
RICHARD: Just leave the form. I'll sign it later.
EMILY: What are you doing? The putter's not down there.
LORELAI: No, but your tax form's here. Come on, dad. Sign it. [Sighs] Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
RICHARD: And, yes! There it is.
EMILY: Hallelujah, we found the putter. We have a few more things we need to go over with you.
RICHARD: Later today, dear.
EMILY: You always say that, but you never do. And wear a hat!
RICHARD: Yes, mother.
EMILY: Ugh!
[Lorelai's cell phone rings]
LORELAI: Well, mom, he was watching golf. Now he's playing golf. That's progress. [Answering the phone] Hey, kid.
RORY: I'm in.
LORELAI: You're robbing a bank?
RORY: The road trip -- I'm going with you to Mia's wedding.
LORELAI: Wow, that's great! Are you sure?
RORY: Yes, I so need to get away. I just had a huge fight with Logan.
LORELAI: Oh, sweetie, why?
RORY: Because he's being a complete a jerk. He won't deal with anything. And Mitchum just showed up at the apartment.
LORELAI: Mitchum came?
RORY: I opened the door, and there he was in a really expensive coat and all this cologne. And he yelled at Logan, and Logan yelled back. And, yes, Mitchum is jerk, but I actually agreed with him, and I told Logan that.
LORELAI: You agreed with the boyfriend's dad? That's brave.
RORY: I couldn't help it, mom. Logan is being immature. And I can't focus on my work, and I need to get out of here.
LORELAI: Oh honey it sounds like a trip like this is just what you need.
EMILY: A trip like what?
LORELAI: Nothing, mom.
RORY: Are you with grandma?
LORELAI: Yes, it's our Thursday computer lesson. And it's no "Tuesdays with Morrie."
EMILY: Where are you going?
LORELAI: Mia Halloway's wedding -- Charlotte, North Carolina.
RORY: I have to be back by Monday.
LORELAI: That should be no problem. This is gonna be a blast!
EMILY: Charlotte.
LORELAI: Mia wanted me to do a toast, and I thought I could do a poem, you know like you used to do for her when you were a kid, so you have to help me.
EMILY: Kiki Saltberry just came back from a spa in Charlotte. It's the Valentine Resort, I think she said, and she came back looking radiant.
RORY: What is grandma saying?
LORELAI: [Too Emily] We're staying at a Best Western mum. No spa facilities there. [back to Rory] So, okay, I'll pick you up at the crack of dawn. We'll cram everything in the jeep. No bathroom breaks along the way, okay?
RORY: Does grandma want to come?
LORELAI: No. I mean, yes, but, no.
EMILY: I'd have to rearrange my schedule, but that can be done.
LORELAI: Mom, you really can't leave dad all alone.
EMILY: Alone, yes, completely alone, with two maids, a cook, and a nurse who comes daily.
RORY: Yes, grandma should come, too. It'll be a hoot.
LORELAI: It would be fun, honey, but grandma's real busy.
EMILY: Rory wants me to come?
LORELAI: Well...
EMILY: Well, she'll be graduating soon, and I won't have many more opportunities to spend time with her. This is perfect…
LORELAI: Mum…
EMILY: I'm gonna start packing.
LORELAI: Oh, mom.
EMILY: Oh, and we'll take my car. I have no intention of driving 800 miles in an army vehicle.
RORY: g*n?
LORELAI: [Chuckles]
HIGHWAY – TO CHARLOTTE
[Emily is driving the Jag, there is a line of traffic behind here, honking there horns. Lorelai is in the passengers seat and Rory in the back]
LORELAI: Oh, mom, if you're gonna go this slowly, you should really put your hazards on.
EMILY: Excuse me, but after I almost got that ridiculous DWI, I can ill afford a speeding ticket. And a jaguar is an invitation to be pulled over.
LORELAI: Right, if you're speeding. You're driving like you're in a parade.
EMILY: Oh, hush.
LORELAI: Mom, seriously, by the time we get there, the wedding will be over. The guests will have gone home. North Carolina will be under a sea of water from melting ice caps.
RORY: "See ya."
LORELAI: Huh?
RORY: You could rhyme "Mia" with "see ya."
LORELAI: Oh, that's good. Or "be ya."
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: You were such a peach, dear Mia, when Rory grew up, she wanted to be ya.
RORY: Good. But do you think it owes too much to Yeats?
LORELAI: Well, it needs some work, but you try finding something to rhyme with "Howard" besides "coward."
EMILY: Howard? She's marrying a man named Howard?
LORELAI: What's wrong with Howard?
EMILY: It's just, for me, it would be very difficult if my husband was named Howard.
RORY: Why?
EMILY: It's just not a noble name. I like noble male names, strong -- john, peter.
RORY: Richard.
EMILY: Exactly. Richard the lion-heart.
LORELAI: Well, I guess name nobility wasn't high on Mia's list.
EMILY: Howard the lion-heart. [Laughs] What are you doing?
LORELAI: It's stuffy.
EMILY: It's too cold to have the window open.
LORELAI: Mom, just let me have it down -- oh, my god.
EMILY: Lorelai, stop playing with the window.
LORELAI: I'm not playing. I just want it down. And you're making it go -- are you kidding me? Plea-- mother, I'm putting it -- I'm putting it -- [Gasps] Wha-- uh -- mom!
EMILY: It's called a child lock, appropriately enough.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
EMILY: So, Rory, what do you have lined up postgraduation?
RORY: Oh, I'm setting up interviews at different newspapers -- The Seattle Times, The Detroit Free Press, San Francisco Chronicle.
EMILY: Well, I'm not sure about the Seattle paper, and the Chronicle is dreadful, but the Detroit paper is quite reputable.
LORELAI: You know what else a reputable paper is? The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Hartford Courant.
RORY: Yes, and only a short drive away from stars hollow.
LORELAI: Oh, well, that never occurred to me, but now that you mention it, yeah.
EMILY: So, how does Logan feel about the possibility of your moving far away?
RORY: I'm not sure.
EMILY: You're not sure?
RORY: No. Things with Logan are...
EMILY: Are what?
RORY: Uh, we're kind of going through something.
EMILY: Aw, that's a shame. Such a nice young man. He was so thoughtful when your grandfather was in the hospital.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, the Skirf.
RORY: Oh, the Skirf.
EMILY: What's a Skirf?
LORELAI: Well, when Rory was really little, my first sewing project was trying to make her a skirt.
RORY: It was a disaster.
LORELAI: It was terrible. But Mia made me feel better by putting it on Rory's head and saying I created something new, called a Skirf.
RORY: Yeah.
EMILY: So, do we all like show tunes? I found this marvelous CD when I took the car to be washed.
MUSIC: "All the cattle are standing like statues…"
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT
[Lane, Zach and Luke have diner]
LANE: And I was put on bed rest so the babies wouldn't come out before my due date. And I look at the calendar, and I say to Zach, "Zach, it's my due date."
ZACH: And I'm like, "so?"
LANE: And I say, "so now I want them to come out."
ZACH: And I go, "duh, let's get out of bed."
[Laughter]
LANE: Well I guess they can come out whenever they want, as long as we've finished our meal...
[Laughter]
LUKE: ...Which, by the way, was terrific, Lane. Thanks.
ZACH: Yeah, she had no problem switching to a different meal when I told her about your curry issues.
LUKE: Well, it's -- I just…
ZACH: Whatever.
LUKE: It's not really an issue. Again, look, sorry about the wine. I totally spaced. I should have brought you something sparkling, you know a fruity kind of a thing.
ZACH: No, it's okay. Besides, they say one of the things you can do to help induce labor is have a glass of wine.
ZACH: That or sex.
LUKE: Well, I can only help you with the wine.
[Laughter]
LUKE: I should get going. I got to get up early and open the diner.
ZACH: Are you sure you don't want dessert? Homemade peach pie.
LUKE: You made a peach pie?
ZACH: Well, actually, you made it at the diner, which is technically your home, but I paid for it.
LUKE: I'll have one quick piece.
ZACH: Yes!
LUKE: You know this is really nice of you guys.
ZACH: What do you expect, man? You mean a lot to Lane and me.
LANE: You do.
ZACH: We feel really close to you, and not just, you know, employees.
LUKE: Yeah, uh, me too.
LANE: When it comes to extended family, Zach and I don't have much. I mean I've got my mom, but she's not so much a family member as she is a probation officer.
ZACH: Yeah and my old man ran off when I was like 10 -- no note, no nothing. So I got the feeling, you know, he didn't want me to follow him.
LUKE: Mm-hmm. So, you guys need money or something?
ZACH: Lane and I would like you to be godfather to our twins.
LUKE: Oh, really? Godfather?
LANE: We just want to make sure we have a strong parental person for our boys.
LUKE: Well...
ZACH: There's no paperwork involved.
LUKE: Right. I just…
ZACH: No notary public.
LUKE: No, I know. It's just [Sighs and takes a few seconds to think.] Yeah, okay, sure.
LANE: [Squeals]
ZACH: Oh, man. That is so great. [Too Lane, high 5] Up high. [Then Luke] Come on.
LUKE: All right. Okay. [High 5's both Lane and Zach]
ZACH: There you go.
WINKY'S DINER
[Lorelai, Rory and Emily enter. Emily is on the phone]
EMILY: No, are you listening? I've already booked a Swedish massage for 1:00. I want to know what I can do at 2:30. Good lord, no. A Watsu? Why would I want to re-experience my own birth?
CHARLENE: I'll be back to take your orders.
RORY: Big menus.
LORELAI: Yeah, that's a good sign.
RORY: Oh I love when they show pictures of the food.
LORELAI: I would be upset if I was that fried chicken, though. That picture makes her look fat.
EMILY: Fine. Book me a salt scrub at 2:30. Thank you. [ends call] Where on earth are we?
LORELAI: Well, mom, since you wouldn't let us take you to a drive-through, we've come here to Winky's, a fine eatery just off I-85.
EMILY: Very down home.
CHARLENE: We ready here?
LORELAI: Oh, uh, uh, I'm only halfway through. Don't tell me how it turns out. Um…
EMILY: I smell cigarette smoke. This is one of those places that still allows cigarettes isn't it?
LORELAI: Mom, if you'd prefer to wait in the car, we can bring food to you there.
EMILY: Well that would be foolish, the reason why I refused to go to the drive-through is because I won't allow eating in my car.
RORY: Hey, they have lobster.
LORELAI: Lobster for $12.95. How could you go wrong? I'll have the lobster.
RORY: See, you'll have lobster. I'll have shrimp. We'll make it a seafood night.
EMILY: Seafood in a place like this -- very risky.
LORELAI: And a hot dog. A hot dog for the table. You'll go in on that with us, won't you, mom?
EMILY: I'll have a turkey sandwich on wheat and a glass of chardonnay. That's the clear one.
CHARLENE: My name is Charlene. Holler if you need something.
RORY: Wow, huge case of cakes behind you there.
LORELAI: Ooh, yeah. Winky's got a trophy case full of cakes. Hey, I bet Mia makes her triple-layered German chocolate cake for the wedding, don't you think?
RORY: Probably.
EMILY: Mmm. Aromatherapy -- that's what I want. Are you sure you two won't join me for something at the spa -- facial, Moroccan mud wrap? My treat.
LORELAI: Mother, we came here because we made a commitment to go to a wedding, so that's what we're gonna do.
EMILY: Suit yourself. I need to use the facilities. Wish me luck.
LORELAI: I love it here. And I'm totally gonna score a panda in that crane machine on the way out.
RORY: Mum do you think we should dial back the talk about Mia in front of grandma? I mean I don't think she's thrilled to hear about our surrogate mother/grandmother.
LORELAI: She knew that Mia is the reason for the trip. I think it's okay if we talk about her.
RORY: I know, but it seems to bother her. You know and I thought, during this trip, we could do more mother/daughter, daughter/daughter bonding.
LORELAI: 10 hours in the car not enough bonding for you?
RORY: I'm just worried about you guys. I mean what's gonna happen after I graduate?
LORELAI: After you graduate? That's when the party gets started.
RORY: Yeah, I just -- I want you guys to remain close.
LORELAI: Close?
RORY: Ish.
LORELAI: Honey, your grandma and I have a very complicated relationship, but we'll be fine. I don't want you to worry. You go off and do your own thing. I'm a grown-up. A grown-up who wears a bib. [Charlene hands Lorelai the bib] Thank you.
BEST WESTERN – MOTEL ROOM
LORELAI: All righty. Looks like our choices are "Hitch" or "The Lake House."
RORY: I could use a laugh.
LORELAI: Alright the "The Lake House" it is.
RORY: Oh, my dress got wrinkled.
LORELAI: Honey, just put it in the shower with the steam if mom ever finishes shellacking her face.
EMILY: [Off screen] I heard that, Lorelai. I'm simply washing up.
LORELAI: Mom, the resort is 20 minutes away. Why do you have to wash up here?
EMILY: I can't very well arrive at a luxurious resort smelling of bad shellfish and covered with the grime of the road.
LORELAI: "The road." Who are you -- Willie Nelson? [Telephone rings] Hello. [Gasps] Mia, how is the blushing bride-to-be?
MIA: Surprisingly calm, but then I've had two glasses of wine, so we'll see how I do tomorrow when the buzz wears off.
LORELAI: Ah you'll do great.
[Rory joins Lorelai listening on the same phone]
RORY: Hi, Mia.
MIA: Oh, hi, Rory. I just wanted to see if you got here all right. How's the motel? Not too terrible, I hope.
LORELAI: Oh, no, it's great. We have two beds, sanitized cups, Keanu Reeves in his most touching role to date. What could be better?
[Emily gestures that she is leaving]
RORY: Oh, grandma, hold on.
MIA: Oh, Emily's with you?
LORELAI: Oh, um, yeah, we picked her up hitchhiking on her way to a rock festival.
RORY: She's going to the valentine resort.
MIA: Well, if Emily's here, then she has to come to the wedding.
LORELAI: Oh no, that's okay. She's spending tomorrow getting rubbed, wrapped, and scrubbed.
EMILY: Oh, no, she's asking me to the wedding?
LORELAI: [Quietly to Emily] No, no. It's okay. [Too Mia] Um so the ceremony's at noon. We'll be there around 11:30.
MIA: Oh, please ask Emily to come. We have plenty of food. Howard and I would be thrilled to have her join us. In fact, I insist.
RORY: [Taking the phone] That is so thoughtful of you, Mia, and I am sure she would love to come.
EMILY: Oh great. Now I have to go.
LORELAI: No, you don't.
EMILY: It would be rude not to. Damn!
RORY: She says she's delighted and flattered that you asked.
MIA: Oh, that's wonderful. I look forward to seeing all three of you tomorrow. Sleep well.
RORY: You, too, Mia. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
[Rory hangs up the phone, Lorelai makes a WFT face to Rory.]
EMILY: Well, I hope the resort will let me change my times. I'll pick the two of you up at 11:00 sharp tomorrow. Be out front. Of course, I didn't bring a thing to wear to a wedding. Luckily, they're going bohemian, so it won't really matter.
[Emily leaves]
LORELAI: Ugh!
RORY: We're bonding.
LORELAI: [Sighs]
RORY: Oh, this could be a good thing.
LORELAI: Oh, the only good thing is that mom is gonna get to the resort still smelling like bad lobster, 'cause I left my doggie bag in her car.
[They sit back on the bad and Lorelai starts the movie]



LUKE'S DINER – EARLY MORNING
[Luke comes down and starts getting the diner ready for the day. He hears a knock on the door.]
ZACH: Hey.
LUKE: Everything okay?
ZACH: Great. Everything's -- yeah. Great.
LUKE: You know I don't open for another hour.
ZACH: Oh, no, I know, but last night when you said you had to get up early, I realized it's time, maybe, I come and help crank up the place.
LUKE: Okay.
ZACH: I actually love this time of day, you know, real quiet. [Starts taking the chair off the tables] You know what's, like, amazing? How peaceful Stars Hollow is at this time of day. It's, like, spooky peaceful. You ever notice that?
LUKE: I'm sorry. I-I really don't enjoy talking this early in the morning.
ZACH: Oh, hey, copy that. I'm right there with you.
LUKE: [Sighs]
ZACH: Now, Lane -- she loves to talk in the morning. Lots of morning chin music with that one. Not me. I take not talking over talking any day. [Starts putting source dispensers out on the counter, one falls.] Ooh, awesome catch.
LUKE: Thanks.
ZACH: Pretty obvious you played some ball.
LUKE: A little.
ZACH: I didn't really get into sports much. My dad didn't do sports with me when I was little, and then he, you know, split.
LUKE: Yeah, you said. That's too bad.
ZACH: Yeah. What kind of music you into?
LUKE: I don't really listen to much music.
ZACH: No?
LUKE: I mean if I'm driving around in my truck, I'll, you know, maybe put on an oldies station. I like some Motown.
ZACH: Oh dude I know the perfect band for you. You would so get off on them. They're young, but their sound is way borrowed from those old guys from the '70s.
LUKE: Listen, I got to fire up the stoves.
ZACH: Yeah, go, go. Fire 'em up.
LUKE: You know, I can't pay you any extra 'cause you came in early.
ZACH: Oh, yeah, I know. I just figure it's part of my job, and it's a chance for us to hang out. Plus, you know... [quietly] the quiet.
LUKE: Right.
MIA'S HOUSE
[Lorelai, Rory and Emily enter]
EMILY: Lorelai, you didn't even knock.
LORELAI: Well, that's okay. Mia leaves the door open. She likes people to just come on in.
RORY: She's probably too busy to greet everybody, grandma.
EMILY: Well, of course she is. She should have someone greet people for her.
RORY: Oh, look at all these great pictures.
LORELAI: Not everyone has a maid, you know, mom.
EMILY: How hard is it to hire a maid for the day?
LORELAI: Well, last I checked, they didn't have them at Bed Bath & Beyond.
RORY: Oh, this must be Howard. Look. Here we are.
LORELAI: Oh so cute. That's the rug where you used to spin around at the independence inn. I bet you threw up just seconds after that picture was taken.
RORY: Yep.
EMILY: Are we going in, or are we going to watch from the entryway?
MIA: Oh, you're here! Lorelai!
LORELAI: Hi!
RORY: Hi!
[Emily looks on as they hug]
MIA: Did you find it all right?
LORELAI: Yeah, mom's got the GPS. Apparently, it's great if you know how to use it.
RORY: Yeah, we saw a lot of your neighborhood -- very nice.
MIA: Oh, those damn GPS drive me crazy. Whatever happened to asking the guy at the gas station?
EMILY: Good question. Hello, Mia. Thank you so much for inviting me to this special occasion.
[They hold hands]
MIA: Emily, I'm so glad you could be here. Well, let's go in. Let's not just stand here. I know a wedding wasn't what you had in mind when you came down here.
EMILY: What I had in mind was spending time with my daughter and granddaughter, wherever.
MIA: Oh, will you sign my guest book, please?
EMILY: Oh certainly.
MIA: I just feel so lucky to have all the Gilmore ladies under one roof.
EMILY: Speaking of roofs, you have a charming home.
MIA: Oh, thank you.
EMILY: I'm always amazed at what good taste can do with a small space.
LORELAI: Oh, it is beautiful.
RORY: Yeah, so many personal touches everywhere.
MIA: Thank you. I agree with Emily. It's a small house, and it's made even smaller by Howard's junk. But you know what they say -- you marry a man, you marry his junk. Howard.
HOWARD: Mia…
MIA: Howard, Howard. This is Emily Gilmore, the mother and grandmother of the famous Lorelai and Rory.
RORY AND LORELAI: [Together] Hi.
EMILY: Nice to meet you.
HOWARD: How do you do.
LORELAI: I thought you weren't supposed to see the bride in her gown before you got married.
MIA: Uh-oh! [covers Howard's eyes]
[Laughter]
RORY: Yeah, and if the bride sees a lizard crossing the road, that's bad news, too.
LORELAI: Really!
MIA: Oh, well, haven't seen a lizard, but too late for the dress, 'cause Howard zipped me up.
LORELAI: Oh no, where's the zip-up on the bad-luck-o-meter?
RORY: Not sure, but I'd throw some salt over your shoulders just in case.
LORELAI: I don't have any salt. I might have some Splenda.
HOWARD: You are exactly as Mia described you -- you both are. And believe me, she described you a lot.
LORELAI: Well, I hope she left out the bad stuff.
MIA: There's no bad stuff.
EMILY: Lucky you. [Chuckles]
HOWARD: Well the sooner we get married the sooner we get cake.
MIA: Oh, honey, you're so romantic. Emily, could I just borrow the girls for a quick touch-up in the powder room?
EMILY: They're all yours.
MIA: Oh, thanks. Okay, guys, let's get me beautiful.
EMILY: [Too someone taking her coat] Oh, thank you.
HOWARD: Mia adores them.
EMILY: Yes, I know.
HOWARD: [Sighs] Well, come in. Find a seat.
EMILY: The sofa will be fine.
[A short time later after the ceremony]
LORELAI: And so, a toast to you, dear Mia. It makes us all so glad to see ya... blissfully joined with dear, good Howard. May your love last long, like it's battery-powered. [Laughter] Rory and I wanted to do a poem for you, because when Rory was little, she used to love making up poems, and we would perform them for you, and that was such a fun time. [noticing Emily looking uncomfortable] Um... uh, so, what I've realized now is that you can get away with a lot of bad rhymes when you're cute and 5. But we do want to say...
EMILY: [Too another guest] Excuse me would you mind terribly getting me a glass of water?
LORELAI: ...The best things in life are worth waiting for, even if they take a long time...
EMILY: [Too Rory] she keeps her house very dry.
LORELAI: So, let's... a toast to you. [Rising a champagne glass] We love you so much. Cheers.
EVERYONE: Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Hear, hear! Congratulations.
LORELAI: Oh.
MIA: Thank you. [Laughing] That was wonderful.
[The Man brings back the water for Emily and quietly asks]
MAN: Are you Rory? There's someone here to see you.
[Points to show Logan standing in the next room, Rory gets up while Mia continues to talk.]
MIA:...That you are here today. And thank you for those of you who came from so far away. Thank you again for the toast. I'll thank my sister for all the wonderful help...
LOGAN: [quietly] Hey.
RORY: [quietly] What the hell are you doing here?
LOGAN: I'm sorry I don't mean to crash this. I just need to talk to you.
RORY: How did you know where I was?
LOGAN: I called Paris, she found the invitation. I kept trying your cell, but you didn't pick up.
RORY: Well, that's the advantage of caller I.D.
LOGAN: I get it. You're still mad.
RORY: No kidding.
LOGAN: But now I'm here, so you have to talk to me – that's the advantage of showing up in person.
RORY: Wow, I can't believe you're still doing this. This is so last year's Logan.
LOGAN: What?
RORY: You think you can just fly anywhere I am and overwhelm me by just showing up and -- I'm just not impressed anymore by your grand gestures.
LOGAN: I'm not trying to impress you Rory. I just want to tell you what I've been thinking.
RORY: Well I don't care…
LOGAN: And I wanted to see you.
RORY: I'm in the middle of a wedding of a close friend. I don't have time to stand here and listen to you explain your stupid immature behavior.
LOGAN: If you would just hear me out.
RORY: No, you go blow off steam in Vegas, you gamble away thousands of dollars, you drink all night, and do god knows what else. This is me blowing off steam.
HOWARD: I'm sorry to interrupt, Rory, but Mia wanted me to tell you we're about to cut the cake.
RORY: Okay.
HOWARD: Will your friend join us?
RORY: Um, no, he can't stay.
LOGAN: Yeah, I was just stopping by. Thanks, anyway.
HOWARD: Oh, okay.
[Rory and Howard go to the cake cutting.]
LUKE'S DINER
[The diner is busy with bowlers]
LADY: Hey girls.
LADIES: Hey there.
LUKE: Talk to me, Zach. What do you got?
ZACH: Okay, bowl of chili, two dogs, one BLT, shepherd's pie, and a mushroom soup. And those guys in the corner were asking me if I had a pack of lucky strikes or a burger to spare, what's that about?
LUKE: Bowling humor -- strikes, spares. Never gets old, guys.
ZACH: Oh, I totally missed it. Oh, man!
LUKE: What's wrong?
ZACH: Last night, I made this mix of tunes that I thought would be right up your alley.
LUKE: Okay.
ZACH: Well, you know, new stuff that sounds kind of classic rock-y -- My Morning Jacket, who are like Neil Young reborn, if Neil would have, you know, died.
LUKE: Uh-ha Wolfmother – definitely channeling Zeppelin -- modern, but not so much that it would freak out somebody of your taste.
LUKE: The point.
ZACH: The point is, I totally forgot to bring it.
LUKE: Oh, don't worry about it.
ZACH: Yeah, but I spent, like, all night on it.
LUKE: Ah that's nice.
ZACH: Gave me something to do instead of sitting around, waiting for Lane to pop out the babies.
LUKE: It'll happen.
ZACH: Yeah, don't I know it? [Too customers] Denver omelet, steak sandwich.
LUKE: Two cheeseburgers -- medium and well.
ZACH: Question -- circumcision, yes or no?
LUKE: Pardon?
ZACH: I mean we have to make a decision as soon as the boys are born, and I'm really on the fence about it.
LUKE: Ahh…
ZACH: I thought about having Mrs. Kim weigh in, but her opinion would be kind of hypothetical 'cause she doesn't have the goods, as far as I know.
LUKE: Right.
ZACH: Right, so, you being a guy, I figured I could use your input on this.
LUKE: You know, you saying something like this -- it's kind of personal between you and Lane, so go with your gut.
ZACH: Yeah, okay.
LUKE: Alright.
ZACH: Cool.
LUKE: Bill, refill?
ZACH: Let's say your kid falls out of a tree and majorly gashes his head. Do you run to him right away or just let him kind of shake it off? I mean I don't want to be a wussy dad, but…
LUKE: Probably not the right time to be talking about gashed heads and circumcisions.
ZACH: Right. Right. I totally get that. Maybe we could, uh, go over to Casey's after work and grab a beer and talk about some stuff.
LUKE: Look, I-I can't be…
ZACH: Please.
LUKE: Okay.
[Luke ushers Zach over to the corner]
LUKE: Listen, I know what's going on, okay? You're about to become a father, so you're panicking.
ZACH: I am, dude, big-time.
LUKE: Promise you you'll get through this.
ZACH: I don't know how to throw a damn Frisbee.
LUKE: Don't worry about it, okay?
ZACH: I just -- I really could use your help on all this father stuff that I know nothing about.
LUKE: Zach…
ZACH: What the hell are they supposed to call me -- "dad," "pop," "papa"? Do I look like a papa to you?
LUKE: It'll come to you eventually.
ZACH: Papa is a big, cuddly guy from Italy with all this dark hair. That's so not me.
LUKE: Listen, the first time April turned up in my life, I didn't know squat about being a father, but eventually, it came to me. Okay I found my dad mode, and you will, too.
ZACH: Dude, I hope so.
LUKE: Yeah. Don't sweat it. And go ahead and deliver these to the clowns in the corner over there. You will be fine. [Sighs] I -- okay, all right.
BILL: Guy's a real goofball, huh?
LUKE: Yeah, watch it, bill. [Takes his plate]
BILL: I'm not finished with that pie.
LUKE: Yeah, you are.
MIA'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is talking to someone, country music is playing.]
MAN: And I drove through Connecticut once -- beautiful. In fact, Cathy and I considered moving to New England 'cause we love the foliage.
LORELAI: Well, we got a lot of that. It practically grows on trees.
[She is watching Emily and not interested in the man or what he is saying]
MAN: But the cold -- no thank you. I can barely handle it here in Charlotte when it drops below 40. Cathy says it's a circulation thing. I think it's a matter of not having the fat layer that you women do.
LORELAI: You should be glad you don't have it. If you did, you couldn't wear such an amazing sweater.
RORY: Hey, Mia put out some of her famous mini cream puffs. They're delicious.
MAN: Uh-oh, may have to get me one of those. Scusie.
LORELAI: God bless you.
RORY: Ha. No problem. You looked a little trapped there.
LORELAI: No, no, I was riveted by stories of foliage and fat. Where'd you go off to?
RORY: Logan showed up.
LORELAI: What?!
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Where is he?
RORY: Outside, leaning against a car.
LORELAI: Why? You wouldn't let him come in?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Really? Look at you, all tough love.
RORY: Well I'm still mad at him. I'm not gonna melt just because he flies down here to see me. If we're gonna do this, it's gonna be on my terms.
LORELAI: Wow.
RORY: It doesn't look like grandma's having a good time.
LORELAI: No, grandma's staging a sit-in, as only grandma could do, in the middle of a hoopla. Some people would call it a shindig. I'm here to tell you it's a hoopla.
RORY: I have so much to learn from you still.
HOWARD: Ladies, I'm striking out left and right in my attempts to coax someone to dance. Would either of you salvage my pride?
RORY: Howard, I'll dance with you.
HOWARD: Thank you.
RORY: [Too Lorelai] Talk to grandma.
LORELAI: [Sighs and walks over to sit down with Emily] Hi, mom. How are you doing?
EMILY: Oh, fine. I'm just going through my schedule for the week.
LORELAI: So, did Howard ask you to dance?
EMILY: He did, yes -- very thoughtful.
LORELAI: Why didn't you dance with him?
EMILY: I don't feel like dancing right now. Besides, I have no idea how one dances to cowboy music.
LORELAI: You want to dance with me? We could slap our knees, shout "yee-haw."
EMILY: No thank you I think I'll just wait for the appropriate moment to excuse myself gracefully.
LORELAI: Mom, I didn't think you were gonna want to come.
DONNA: So, Lorelai, gal, we have got to do some catching up. How have you been, sweetie?
LORELAI: Good, Donna. Good.
DONNA: Mia says you have you own inn now. That is so far out.
LORELAI: It is great. Um, mom, this is Donna. This is my mother, Emily Gilmore.
EMILY: How do you do?
DONNA: Really well, thank you.
LORELAI: Donna and I were maids together at the Independence Inn.
DONNA: A few hundred lives ago, huh? Hey, listen, your toast was so great.
LORELAI: Thanks. I didn't know I was gonna be the only one.
DONNA: Oh, but you were the perfect choice. I mean, for god's sake, Mia was like a mother to you.
LORELAI: Um, so, how are you? You look good.
DONNA: I do, don't I?
LORELAI: Yeah,
DONNA: I tell you, six years ago, when I first started the raw-foods thing…
EMILY: Do you know if they put the coffee out yet?
LORELAI: Mother.
EMILY: What? I'm sorry, but you're talking about something between the two of you, and I could really use a cup of coffee.
DONNA: You know what? I am having a serious craving for herbal tea. Let's get something together, Emily.
EMILY: All right.
LORELAI: [Sighs, gets up to get a drink.]
MIA: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey.
MIA: Everything okay?
LORELAI: Yeah. It's fine. I just always seem to forget my mother doesn't play well with others.
MIA: Oh, I think she's doing all right, considering.
LORELAI: Considering...
MIA: I mean, in terms of you and me and Rory and our history.
LORELAI: Yeah, so? We have a history.
MIA: Seeing me with you must bring back very painful memories. Imagine how difficult it must have been for your mother to lose you.
LORELAI: She didn't lose me. I embarrassed her, so I had to leave.
MIA: But Lorelai even in the best of circumstances, you never want to think that your child doesn't need you anymore.
LORELAI: She wanted me out of the house so she didn't have to explain why my school uniform didn't fit any more.
MIA: That's not the impression I got when she came to see me.
LORELAI: What? When did she come to see you?
MIA: Oh, must have been five years ago, when I came back for that visit to stars hollow. She came and found me at the inn.
LORELAI: Why?
MIA: I think she wanted to meet me. And she asked me to send her photos of you and Rory from those years when you were staying with me. She never told you?
LORELAI: No, she definitely never told me.
HOWARD: Well, my dear, my dancing feet are all warmed up. [giggles] Your turn.
MIA: Oh, goody, the dance. Now we find out if we're really meant to be together.
HOWARD: Ooh.
MIA'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR
[Nighttime, Rory goes out to see Logan.]
LOGAN: You didn't have to bring me cake.
RORY: I didn't. [Sits on the front of the car and starts eating] You wanted to talk, so talk.
LOGAN: All I wanted to do was say I'm sorry, so...I'm sorry. You were right. I was being immature.
RORY: Okay.
LOGAN: When the whole deal fell apart... I knew I was in so much trouble, I just -- I totally lost it. I couldn't face anything. I had so much invested in it in every way that, when it all collapsed, it was like I fell into this hole I couldn't pull myself out of. And I also realized that my dad was right. He had every reason to be pissed at me. I mean, I would have fired me for what I did. So, I decided the only way to fix this is to not be my dad's employee anymore.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: I went to him, and I just -- I said -- I was calm, apologetic, no shouting, no threats. I just said I didn't want to be a pawn in whatever game he had in mind for me.
RORY: Really.
LOGAN: I am officially not working for the Huntzberger group anymore.
RORY: Oh, my god.
LOGAN: Yeah, and it feels really good. I mean, it felt great finally standing up to my dad.
RORY: How did he take it?
LOGAN: He tried to put up this cool, detached front, you know but I think I actually saw steam coming out of his ears. Basically, he told me to hit the road.
RORY: And you took him literally.
LOGAN: I just needed to see you. The thing is, even though he was mad, I swear I saw the slightest glimmer of pride in his eyes, you know just for a second. I mean, no one walks out on Mitchum Huntzberger.
RORY: I'm proud of you, too. I almost wish I'd saved you a bite of cake. Hmm.
MIA'S HOUSE
[Inside Emily is watching Logan and Rory]
MIA: Boyfriend?
EMILY: Yes.
MIA: He came with you?
EMILY: No, I guess he flew down to see Rory.
MIA: It's hard for me to think of little Rory with a boyfriend.
EMILY: She's not so little anymore.
MIA: No. I just hope she doesn't get her heart broken.
EMILY: I can assure you, if anyone does any heartbreaking, it will be Rory.
MIA: Probably.
[Lorelai comes up and listens]
EMILY: Definitely. She's such a smart, confident young woman. She's really amazing -- witty, charming, valedictorian in high school, editor of the college paper. Sounds like she'll have her pick of jobs at newspapers all over the country. Rory will be fine.
MIA: Well, you would know.
LORELAI: Hey. [Hands Emily her coat] Here you go. Well, we should probably get going, let Mia and Howard do whatever it is they're gonna do the rest of the night.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: What? That could mean anything.
MIA: Well, she's right. The bride and groom have wild plans to take off all their clothes, jump into their pajamas, and listen to "A Prairie Home Companion."
LORELAI: See? Dirty mind -- you.
MIA: I can't tell you how much it meant for me to have you here. Thank you.
[They hug]
LORELAI: Oh, you kidding? I wouldn't have missed it.
EMILY: Mia, best wishes to you. It was a lovely wedding. Thank you... for everything.
MIA: It was my pleasure.
LUKE'S DINER
ZACH: Listen, bill over there is asking for seconds on his pie -- something about how you owe him from earlier.
LUKE: Sure, give it to him.
ZACH: Look, man, I'm really sorry about the way I've been acting -- leaning on you for all this father stuff.
LUKE: Ah don't worry about it.
ZACH: No I was just all bent out of shape about being a good father -- like there is such a thing. And I was so freaking nervous, I'm like, "hey, maybe Luke can take up the slack."
LUKE: Hey, if I can help out, I will.
ZACH: No, but I dig what you said about the dad mode -- makes perfect sense. I'm really psyched to feel it kick in.
LUKE: Okay.
ZACH: Totally. Oh, I almost forgot. This is the CD.
LUKE: Oh, great.
ZACH: Yeah, I listed the band names on the back. I mean, you don't have to listen to it. [Telephone rings, Zach goes to answer it.]
LUKE: No, I want to hear it.
ZACH: [On the phone] Luke's diner.
LUKE: Who knows maybe I'll really get into Wolfmother.
ZACH: Okay, okay. Do not move. I'll be right there. Don't move. I have to go. Lane's water broke. I need my...coat. I-I don't -- I don't need my coat. My keys are in my coat.
LUKE: Al right that's it. We're closed, folks. I'm driving.
ZACH: No, no, no, man. I can do this.
LUKE: Zach, Zach, Zach, Zach.
ZACH: Okay.
LUKE: Dad mode doesn't have to kick in right now. Lets go. Last one out, lock the door, turn off the lights.
BILL: What about my…
LUKE: Just take the whole damn pie, Bill.
BEST WESTERN – MOTEL ROOM
[The room is dark as they enter]
LORELAI: So, he's really not working for his dad?
RORY: No, he's out of there.
LORELAI: Well, it's probably the best thing for him. How did he feel about you sending him back to New York?
RORY: Um, I think he was okay with it. I told him it was an all-girls road trip.
LORELAI: Exactly, no boys allowed, except for that male stripper we hired.
RORY: [Giggles]
EMILY: [Still at the doorway] Well, good night.
RORY: Oh, grandma, aren't you coming in?
EMILY: No, I just wanted to walk you to your room, seeing as this isn't the safest of neighborhoods.
LORELAI: Mom, now I feel like I should walk you back to the car and then you're gonna feel like walk me back and then we'll be stuck in a terrible loop and neither of us is wearing the shoes for that.
RORY: Oh, grandma, you should stay. We're gonna get junk food from the vending machine, and watch a movie. Come on. Don't you like Dots?
[Rory goes to the vending machine]
LORELAI: Hey, get some Little Debbie.
EMILY: Seriously, Rory, I can't stay.
RORY: Too late grandma. I'm already getting you a Little Debbie.
[Few moments of silence]
LORELAI: Oh, I bought her a suit.
EMILY: Did you?
LORELAI: Yeah. It was so fun. It was weird, you know, but um, we found something really great, and it just felt like a rite of passage.
EMILY: I'm sure.
LORELAI: Made me imagine, you know, what it's gonna be like after she leaves.
EMILY: Of course.
LORELAI: It's gonna be hard to be without her.
EMILY: Well, I'm sure you'll get through it.
LORELAI: What I mean to say is, mom, is I know that it was hard for you.
EMILY: Hmm.
LORELAI: Have you seen "The Pursuit of Happyness"?
EMILY: Is that the one with Will Smith? He's so attractive.
LORELAI: Mmm! Mom has a thing for Will Smith.
EMILY: I don't have a thing for him. Is it on now?
LORELAI: Yeah.
[They sit on the end of the bed]
RORY: Oh, my god! Lane had her babies.
LORELAI: [Gasps] Oh!
RORY: Zach just sent me a photo. Here... See?
LORELAI: Oh, cute!
RORY: Aren't they cute?
EMILY: I'm sure that little camera distorts their faces.
LORELAI: What do you mean, mom? They're cute.
RORY: Here's another one.
LORELAI: Oh, sweet.
EMILY: Why did they misspell "Happyness"?
LORELAI: Well, we'll find out. [Stars the movie] There's your boyfriend, mom.
RORY: Who?
EMILY: He's not my boyfriend.
LORELAI: Will Smith -- mom has a thing for him.
RORY: You like Will Smith?
EMILY: I think that he's very charming.
RORY: That's all right.

DRAGONFLY INN
[Sookie and Michel are filling some baskets.]
MICHEL: What are you doing?
SOOKIE: What?
MICHEL: Oh, fine.
SOOKIE: Michel. Michel.
MICHEL: Michel what?
SOOKIE: You can't put your schedules in the front of the basket. It's blocking everything.
MICHEL: So?
SOOKIE: So it shouldn't block everything. It doesn't look good.
MICHEL: [Laughing] Yes, it does. I am a man of refine and renown. Aesthetic Fabien Baron once publicly admired the way I decorated my locker at crunch.
SOOKIE: What?
MICHEL: I worked extremely hard on these schedules, and it looks good.
SOOKIE: Yes, the schedules look nice, okay. Lovely font choice, lovely use of b*llet points, but give me a break it's not like you made them on an antique printing press or something.
MICHEL: Oh! I'm sorry. Did you make your chocolate-dipped apricots on an antique printing press?
SOOKIE: Ha ha. No, of course not.
MICHEL: Touché. [Moves the schedule]
SOOKIE: Ah no, that's not a touché. [Moves the schedule back]
MICHEL: Touché. [Moves the schedule again]
SOOKIE: Touché. [Moves the schedule back]
MICHEL: Tou—
[They start having a slap fight like kids]
SOOKIE: Leave it! leave it! leave it!
LORELAI: [Entering room] Hi, guys. How are the baskets coming?
SOOKIE: Great.
MICHEL: Yeah, just great.
LORELAI: Oh, wow. Looks like Mr. Crankypants is in his usual spring-fling funk.
MICHEL: I'm not in a funk.
LORELAI: I wasn't talking about you, I was talking about Mr. Crankypants. Hey, the schedule looks good.
SOOKIE: You should see his gym locker. Touché.
MICHEL: Touché yourself.
LORELAI: [Reading the schedule] "Dance of the daffodils, bingo, sack races, pie-eating... bird-watching"? We didn't schedule any bird-watching, did we?
MICHEL: There was a void.
LORELAI: Huh?
MICHEL: On the schedule there was nothing scheduled on Saturday evening. It looks ridiculous so I wrote in bird-watching.
LORELAI: Oh, that's clever. Except for the fact we didn't schedule any bird-watching.
MICHEL: So?
LORELAI: So what if people want to do some bird-watch?
MICHEL: Oh, please. No one will want to go bird-watching.
LORELAI: How do you know?
MICHEL: Who wants to watch birds? Why on earth would you watch a bird?
LORELAI: Oh you know what should be on here is hay-bale maze.
SOOKIE: I can't believe we're actually having a hay-bale maze.
MICHEL: Oh, what is wrong with people? Walking in hay? Don't they have lives? Don't they have televisions and elliptical machines? What kind of weirdo wants to walk around in a maze of hay?
LORELAI: Taylor Doose and no one else.
LORELAI: But don't you vote on these things in your adorable little meetings?
SOOKIE: He hoodwinked us.
LORELAI: yeah. This year he gave an impassioned speech about how his childhood dream was to visit a hay-bale maze. And and he was clutching hay and crying. It was very disconcerting but oddly moving. So we voted yes. It was a pity vote.
SOOKIE: And a hoodwinked vote.
LORELAI: And it turns out he wasn't really crying so much as he was allergic to the hay.
MICHEL: Oh! Whatever.
SOOKIE: Michel, people stopped saying "whatever" like two years ago.
MICHEL: Whatever. I'm outtie 5,000.
OPENING CREDITS
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Logan and Doyle having breakfast.]
PARIS: oh. Great.
DOYLE: What's the matter, babe?
PARIS: Logan, did you just polish off a carton of milk?
LOGAN: Oh, yeah, I guess I did. Sorry. There's plenty more in there, though.
PARIS: Well, actually, no.
LOGAN: Really?
PARIS: Nope. There's no milk in here for my cereal. It's cool. I'll just skip breakfast and suffer the afternoon mood swings.
LOGAN: I'm sorry I could have sworn there were like four or five cartons in there.
PARIS: Each of these milks is here for a reason. I need the 2% for my cereal, whole milk for my tea, half-and-half for my coffee, skim milk for cooking or baking, plus, I like to keep lactaid on hand for Doyle.
DOYLE: Which I don't need. Because I'm not lactose intolerant.
PARIS: You're lactose resistant. You have a bias against lactose. You're sensitive.
DOYLE: I'm not sensitive. I have no problem with lactose.
PARIS: There's nothing wrong with being sensitive. Jake Gyllenhaal is sensitive. Orlando Bloom is sensitive.
DOYLE: Me and lactose are cool. We're down.
LOGAN: I tell you what, I'll replenish the 2% and keep my paws off the lactaid.
DOYLE: I don't need the lactaid.
RORY: Good morning.
DOYLE: Me and lactose are bros.
RORY: Glad to hear it.
PARIS: I wouldn't throw Jake Gyllenhaal out of bed.
RORY: Also good to know.
LOGAN: Good morning, ace. Welcome to the party.
PARIS: FYI, there's no 2% milk.
RORY: Ah oh.
LOGAN: Guilty as charged. Man, you look great. That is one smart-looking suit.
RORY: Well, let's hope that it does most of the talking because I keep thinking of questions that they might ask me, and this lovely little thing keeps happening where my mind goes completely blank. You know it's like "Rory, what journalists do you admire?" ah-um "What journalists do I admire?" And nothing. It's a blank. It's like a snowstorm in here. It's all white and empty.
PARIS: Uh-oh.
LOGAN: You're gonna be great.
DOYLE: Absolutely.
PARIS: Or you'll choke. What? It's your first big interview. You very well may panic. I'm just saying, don't panic if you panic.
RORY: Ah that's so sweet, Paris.
DOYLE: Which paper is it?
RORY: The Providence Journal Bulletin.
DOYLE: The pro jo -- no kidding? It's a good paper. Excellent reputation. Top-notch staff.
RORY: Yeah, it could be a really good job.
DOYLE: Oh on the downside, word on the street is they work their cubs hard. Long hours, lots of working lunches. And they do have a comics section.
LOGAN: What's wrong with a comic section?
DOYLE: Let's just say The New York Times does not have a comic section. Speaking of the biz, I should hit the road here. Where the heck is my attaché case?
LOGAN: You are gonna be great.
RORY: Oh, thanks.
PARIS: I got a credit-card statement addressed to you, Logan. Addressed to you here. No "care of..." just you.
LOGAN: Yeah that stuff used to go to my dad's business manager. I had them forward it here. Hope that's okay.
RORY: That's okay. Isn't it okay?
PARIS: Yes. You're right. Of course it's okay.
RORY: Okay, I need to pick out a coat. A trench coat would be too "All The President's Men," but my blue coat would be too "His Girl Friday."
PARIS: I'm just gonna cut to the chase. Why are you here?
LOGAN: You're not talking metaphysically, are you?
PARIS: Seriously, Huntzberger. You're used to living in places with doormen and Danish furniture and refrigerators so fancy, magnets won't stick to them. This craphole's smaller than the walk-in closet in your last pad. What's the deal?
LOGAN: Well, my last pad was not my pad, technically. My dad's company was picking up the rent, and since I'm no longer working with my dad's company, they weren't so keen on it.
PARIS: Plus, you're broke.
LOGAN: I'm not broke.
RORY: What about this? Is it too "That Girl"?
LOGAN: You can never be too "That Girl."
DOYLE: Man, those corn flakes really did a number on me.
RORY: Okay, I better go catch my train. Have a good day.
LOGAN: Good luck, ace. Knock 'em dead.
RORY: Okay I will.
LOGAN: Call me after.
RORY: Okay, bye.
PARIS: Oh, after you're finished with all your work, it'd be great if you could…
LOGAN: Pick up some 2%. I'm on it.
PARIS: "Do the dishes," I was going to say.
LOGAN: Oh, okay, sure.
PARIS: And, Logan, this probably goes without saying, but no scrubby sponges on the Teflon pans.
LOGAN: Wouldn't dream of it.
LUKE'S APARTMENT
LUKE: Wow. What'd you do, raid the New Mexico state library?
APRIL: I know, I know I just couldn't anticipate what I'd be in the mood for. Would I feel like reading Melville or Mcinerney? Or would I be in more of a Native-American, interconnected short-narratives mood, in which case, I'd go for the Louise Erdrich and some "love medicine."
LUKE: Yeah you know what I love about you?
APRIL: My dazzling wit and generous heart?
LUKE: The fact that you could be in a Native-American's interconnective short-narratives mood.
APRIL: It's fascinating stuff, and you know what's funny? Growing up in New England, it's like you're told over and over that you live in this old place where houses are 300 years old and there's all this history, right?
LUKE: Right,
APRIL: Well, some of these pueblos, like the Aztec ruins national monument, or the Casamero Pueblo ruins -- I mean, people were living there in 1100 A.D. It's like, "suck it, New England."
LUKE: It's like what?
APRIL: And actually, one of my swim-team friends lives on the Jicarilla Apache reservation, which is pretty fabulous.
LUKE: Fabulous, huh?
APRIL: "Fabulous" is the new word in school.
LUKE: I see so New Mexico doesn't seem so terrible after all, huh?
APRIL: Yeah, not so terrible.
LUKE: You know, you look good. Grown-up. Maybe it's the new glasses.
APRIL: Thanks. A girl can only be called Sally Jessy so many times before she has to rethink the red frames. Plus, I think these go better with earrings.
LUKE: With...
[April pulls her hair away from her ear]
LUKE: Oh, look at that. You got pierced ears.
APRIL: I basically had to. Unadorned ears seem like a total waste when all around where I live, all this fabulous jewelry making is going on. Oh, speaking of which...
LUKE: What's this?
APRIL: Open it.
LUKE: Ah. [opens the box] Oh, wow, a bracelet.
APRIL: Navaho tradition says that turquoise is a piece of sky that fell to earth. And the apache used to put little pieces of it on their arrows so that they'd aim more true.
LUKE: Well that is very sweet of you, April. Thank you very much.
APRIL: Well? Put it on. Let's see what it looks like.
LUKE: [Chuckles]
APRIL: Fab-u-lous.
LUKE: Yeah, fabulous.
APRIL: Totally.
LUKE: Yeah.
DRAGONFLY INN – RECEPTION DESK
[Michel serves a customer while Lorelai is working on the computer]
MICHEL: Is that a rhetorical question?
MR SINCLAIR: I beg your pardon?
MICHEL: You said, "who doesn't love the spring fling festival?" And I'm asking…
LORELAI: Because we just can't imagine anyone who doesn't love it. Michel, will you grab their keys? Mr. And Mrs. Sinclair, it's so wonderful to have you back. Welcome.
MRS SINCLAIR: We've been dreaming about the festival since the middle of January.
MR SINCLAIR: Mm-hmm. This winter was a doozy.
KID: I got my tongue stuck to the swing set in our backyard.
LORELAI: Wow. Really?
MRS SINCLAIR: He did. I had to get my hair dryer and an extension cord and melt the poor thing free.
LORELAI: Well, it's just pony rides and funnel cakes from now on. Let me show you all our information. [Goes to answer the phone] Oh, just excuse me one second. [On the phone] Dragonfly inn.
RORY: [On a Train] Hey.
LORELAI: Hi, how did it go?
RORY: It went great!
LORELAI: Wow, that's great. Hold on a second. I'll be right back. Michel, will you talk to Rory? [Back to the Sinclair's] Okay, so here's your map.
MICHEL: Hello.
RORY: Hey, Michel. How's it going?
MICHEL: Middling to poor. Where are you? I hear noise.
RORY: I'm on a train on my way back from Providence.
MICHEL: Oh.
RORY: What?
MICHEL: I do not care for trains.
RORY: Oh, no? I'm sorry.
MICHEL: Trains are dirty.
RORY: Well, this train doesn't look very dirty.
MICHEL: You know what I find particularly disgusting?
RORY: What?
MICHEL: Train tracks. They remind me somehow of trails left behind by slugs. You know there are a lot of slugs in the spring, you know? Oozing all over the place. Uh, I think your mother is done now. It was nice talking to you.
LORELAI: [To the Sinclair's] Thank you. Have a good time. [To Rory] Hey.
RORY: So it's spring fling time again, huh?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, when a young man's fancy turns to being totally rude. So tell me about the interview. I want to hear everything. You walked in the door. What kind of door? You sat in a chair. What kind of chair? Go.
RORY: I met the editor, Kate Hessel, and she invited me in. I sat down, we started talking, and we just had so much to talk about. It was great. It was an amazing interview.
LORELAI: Wow! That's great!
RORY: It was we talked about Seymour Hersh and how he was comparing Iran to Nicaragua and the contra w*r and everything, from Alexander Haig and Watergate to the Oprah phenomenon. And the best part was I was just being myself, you know? I was just talking, and I forgot about impressing her.
LORELAI: But there you were, impressing her.
RORY: Yeah and she said she'd call me by tomorrow to let me know whether or not I got the job.
LORELAI: Wow, tomorrow?
RORY: Yes I feel that everything's happening so fast. I can't believe school's almost over. I can't believe it's spring already.
LORELAI: Well, it is, believe me. We are lousy with spring flingers here.
RORY: How are those spring flingers?
LORELAI: Well you know, as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as ever. So you gonna make it this year?
RORY: Oh I do want to come, but…
LORELAI: Yay! Did I just "yay" over your "but"?
RORY: But I wanted to check with you first because I want to make sure it's cool if I bring Logan, too.
LORELAI: Oh. Y-yes, of course. Gosh, I should have thought of that. I'm sorry.
RORY: Oh, no, it's cool.
LORELAI: You can give him the grand tour of Stars Hollow, and I'll show embarrassing pictures of you picking your nose.
RORY: Oh, no. No baby pictures.
LORELAI: Who said they're baby pictures? So, um, you're bringing a guy home.
RORY: It's not like I picked him up at a truck stop.
LORELAI: No, no, I know. You're bringing a suitor, a gentleman caller, home to stars hollow. I'm gonna have to get out my pipe and dust off my "what are your intentions?" Cue cards.
ANNOUNCER ON TRAIN: Next stop, mystic. Mystic, Connecticut.
LORELAI: Listen to you on the train.
RORY: I know. I'm in my suit. I'm reading the paper.
LORELAI: Coming back from your job interview.
RORY: I know I just went on an interview for a real job in the real world.
LORELAI: Wow, I am impressed.
RORY: Thanks, mom.
LORELAI: Seriously. I'm impressed.
RORY: I'll see you tomorrow.
[They hang up and Rory smiles while reading the paper]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – FRONT DOOR
[Rory and Logan enter and make their way to the living room]
RORY: Okay, here we are! This is the entryway, or the foyer, if you're feeling fancy or French.
LOGAN: Wow.
RORY: You can just leave that stuff here. What do you mean "wow"? When you walk into your parents' foyer, there is a genuine-article Magritte right there and a chandelier the size of a Volkswagen. Now, that is a foyer with a capital "F."
LOGAN: Yeah but this is where Rory Gilmore grew up -- the Rory Gilmore.
RORY: Hello?
LORELAI: Are you here?
RORY: No, we're really far away screaming really loudly.
LORELAI: Ha ha ha. Hi, hi! Welcome, welcome!
LOGAN: How you doing, Lorelai?
LORELAI: Good, good. Apparently I say everything twice now. It's charming. Charming.
LOGAN: Well, these are for you. [Hands Lorelai some flowers]
LORELAI: Oh! Wow. Thank you.
LOGAN: Thank you for having me.
LORELAI: They're beautiful. I'll put them in a vase.
LOGAN: They're Cymbidium orchids. They're native to the foothills of the Himalayas.
LORELAI: Well, that sounds fancy. And they look fancy, too. Wow.
LOGAN: This is a beautiful house.
LORELAI: Thank you. I never know what to say when somebody says that. You don't want to agree, but on the other hand, it feels weird to disagree and say, "no, it's a dump," so thank you.
LOGAN: It's charming. Charming.
RORY: Hey, mom, we still get cell reception in here, right?
LORELAI: Yeah, of course, honey. Why? Ooh, the job.
RORY: Yeah, she said she'd let me know by today.
LOGAN: Today's not over. Today's just starting.
LORELAI: Oh, honey, I'm sure she's just busy at work, you know? Speaking of which, I should get to work because Michel's mental state is very precarious today.
RORY: Yeah, go. We'll be fine.
LORELAI: Okay I circled some stuff in the paper for you, though. So you'd have stuff to do. There's some movies if you feel like going to the movies. And um I noticed that the colonial butter churners are having an exhibition at the antiquarian society. That could be kind of funny. And um then there will be a lot to do tomorrow with the festival and everything. There will be games and face-painting and stuff like that...
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: What? You've lived here before?
RORY: Yeah I think I remember enough to show Logan around. This is the town with the Sistine chapel, right?
LORELAI: Oh yeah and don't forget to show him the Pyramids, Kitty-corner from the Wailing wall.
LOGAN: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thanks. Um so I got you guys set up in Rory's room, and um just make yourselves at home. I made up the bed for you and the trundle bed, so you can do whatever you want. I mean, bed-wise.
RORY: Okay great, that's great.
LORELAI: So I'll see you later for dinner. Unless you want to have dinner alone, which is total cool.
LOGAN: Don't be ridiculous.
RORY: We want to have dinner with you.
LORELAI: Okay, good. Well I have the town meeting, but I'll be home after. I will wow you with my takeout-ordering k*ll.
RORY: She really is amazing.
LORELAI: There's talk of a show on the food network.
LOGAN: Sounds great.
LORELAI: And you have some guest towels there.
RORY: Oh, I didn't know we had guest towels.
LORELAI: Of course. "Guest towels." A fancy way of saying "towels that are clean."
RORY: Oh.
LORELAI: All right, I'll see you later. Have fun.
RORY: Okay, bye. I'll take that, then. [Sighing] Oh.
LOGAN: Come here.
RORY: What?
LOGAN: Why don't you come over here and find out?
RORY: What? Here? Where the Rory Gilmore used to sleep?
LOGAN: Hi.
RORY: Hi.
[They kiss]
STARS HOLLOW – OUTSIDE MISS PATTYS
MISS PATTY: And 4 and 5. Keep those toes pointed. Mary, that means you. Extend and reach out. Roots push into the soil!
[Rory and Logan walking down the street]
RORY: And this right here -- this is the very curb where I fell off my bicycle the second time.
LOGAN: Wait, is that blood?
RORY: Yeah you joke, but it was very traumatic, okay? I scraped up my whole face. There was a big old scab on my nose the first two weeks of fifth grade. Oh, they called me bozo.
LOGAN: Bozo.
RORY: And Rudolph and scab nose.
LOGAN: Oh.
RORY: [Giggles] This is the curb where I fell off my bike the third time.
LOGAN: Oh, poor little scab nose.
RORY: Yes. It's also the place where I decided I would never ride a bicycle again in my entire life, or at least till the end of elementary school.
LOGAN: There should be a plaque.
RORY: There should be. Oh and this is Miss Patty's dance school.
LOGAN: Any injuries incurred here?
RORY: Only psychological ones.
LOGAN: That's cute. Those are some pretty avant-garde costumes there?
RORY: They are. They're bold. It's for the dance of the daffodils. There are three acts, you see. In the first one, the bulbs dance, then they grow stalks, and then they bloom into daffodils by the third.
LOGAN: Oh, that's cute.
RORY: Mm-hmm.
LOGAN: And this hay-bale maze -- this is all Taylor's idea?
RORY: Yep.
LOGAN: This is the same Taylor who is town selectman and owns two businesses.
RORY: Yeah, he's basically the Mayor of Stars Hollow and Don Corleone all wrapped up into one.
LOGAN: That's fascinating.
RORY: That's fascinating?
LOGAN: I find Stars Hollow fascinating.
RORY: You're out of your gourd.
LOGAN: No, I'm very much in my gourd. It's like colonial Williamsburg with fewer knickers and Tricorn hats.
RORY: And more hay? This is Luke's diner.
LOGAN: Oh. When you were younger, were you in the dance of the daffodils?
RORY: Maybe.
LOGAN: You were, weren't you?
RORY: Well, therein lies the psychological injury.
LOGAN: What happened?
RORY: I didn't bloom. My headpiece malfunctioned.
LOGAN: Poor little scab nose.
RORY: Yeah.
[They enter Luke's]
LOGAN: Wow, the famous Luke's.
ZACH: Rory!
RORY: Oh, hey, Zach! You know Logan.
ZACH: Sure, sure. How's it going, man?
LOGAN: Great I'm having a great time.
ZACH: Hey, we just saw Kwan and Steve. Oh, yeah? Wait, Lane was there, too, right?
RORY: Yeah.
LOGAN: She was there. She looks great.
RORY: Yeah and the babies are already growing so big.
ZACH: I know, huh? Especially Kwan. Well, at least in the torso. He's got this superlong torso, but Steve's growing in the arms and legs department.
RORY: I noticed he has long legs.
ZACH: Dude, Steve's an octopus, man, but Kwan's got the torso. When it comes to torso, he's so on it.
[They laugh]
ZACH: Well, I got to get back to work. You guys sit anywhere you like.
RORY: Thanks, Zach.
LOGAN: So, is this your table?
RORY: Oh, I guess they're all kind of mine. They're each my own little kitchen table.
[Rory checks her cell phone]
LOGAN: No call?
RORY: No call.
LOGAN: Don't worry.
LUKE: Rory, hey!
RORY: Hey.
LUKE: Hey, Logan.
LOGAN: How's it going, man?
LUKE: Good, good. So what brings you to this neck of the woods?
RORY: Ah the spring fling, and it's my neck -- of the woods, I mean. I wanted to show Logan around.
LUKE: Well, it's good to see you.
RORY: Yeah you too.
LUKE: You know April's here for the festival, too. She's hanging out with her swim buddies, but I know she'd love to see you.
RORY: Oh, great.
LUKE: You guys know what you want, do you need a minute?
RORY: Do you want to peruse the menu first?
LOGAN: Sure.
RORY: We'll peruse.
LUKE: Peruse away.
RORY: [Sighs and checks the cell phone again]
LOGAN: She'll call you. Now, put it away.
RORY: But...
LOGAN: Put it away.
RORY: Hmm. You know, it's so not a big deal.
LOGAN: What isn't?
RORY: Not getting this job. I mean It's not even my first choice. What I really want is the Reston fellowship. And not getting this job is just so not a big deal.
LOGAN: Okay.
RORY: Yeah, I mean, and Providence? It's no Manhattan.
LOGAN: That's true, because it's Providence.
RORY: Right.
LUKE: [bringing water to the table] What the hell?
RORY: Whoa.
LUKE: Taylor, you cannot... [Luke rushes outside] Taylor, what the hell are you doing?
TAYLOR: Now, take it easy, Luke.
LUKE: I am taking it easy, Taylor.
TAYLOR: No, you're not. The veins in your neck are starting to pop out at me.
LUKE: Why is there a giant wall of hay right in front of my diner?!
TAYLOR: The entire town voted. I'm just executing what the town wants.
LUKE: This is not what the town wants. This is what you want!
[Logan and Rory watching from their table]
LOGAN: Oh, stars hollow is better than Colonial Williamsburg.
RORY: Mm-hmm.
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
[Lorelai and Sookie walking]
SOOKIE: So they're staying in the trundle bed, huh?
LORELAI: Yep.
SOOKIE: So if they're all cozy and trundly, I guess that means Logan's out of the doghouse, huh?
LORELAI: Out of the doghouse. Back to roaming the neighborhood.
SOOKIE: What is that tone?
LORELAI: Oh, no tone. He's lovely. I'm glad that they're doing well and they're back together and that he stopped gallivanting.
SOOKIE: Gallivanting?
LORELAI: You know, gambling in Vegas, jumping off buildings, whatever it was he was doing. Of course, I don't love that he was doing it so recently.
SOOKIE: Sounds like Logan's still in somebody's doghouse.
LORELAI: No, no, no. Logan's a lovely young man. He's nice and polite and funny. He's got that hair, you know? The hair that could sell shampoo to a bald man.
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: Logan is a very charming young man.
SOOKIE: I know that tone.
LORELAI: What tone?
SOOKIE: That. The sound of repressed judgment.
LORELAI: I don't know what you're talking about.
SOOKIE: I am talking about last month at the book-shop bake sale when Winsen brown came up and told us that her daughter Maude was just signed by ford, you know, as a baby model, and you were like, "oh, Winsen, that's wonderful. What a great way for a 9-month-old to see the world." That's the exact same tone.
LORELAI: I don't mean to be judgmental.
SOOKIE: I know that's why you're talking like you've had your jaw wired shut. [laughs]
LORELAI: No, I just... I mean, Rory is an adult now, you know? She's riding trains and wearing suits. Made sense for me to have an opinion when we were talking about Jess or Dean, but with Logan, I don't know. It's just really not my place anymore.
SOOKIE: I see.
LORELAI: I mean sure, I don't love that he just did a business deal behind his father's back and lost millions of dollars. And I don't love that after that, he quit his job and moved in with Rory. These are not things I love. And I'm not crazy about the fact that, apparently, in the name of getting on his feet, he's writing in some sort of idea book, which is, as far as I can tell, is just a notebook in which he writes ideas.
SOOKIE: Wait, what?
LORELAI: Yeah, right. I mean I have a dream journal, but I don't use it as evidence of my responsibility. Look, he's an overcoiffed, overprivileged young man, but it's not my place.
SOOKIE: To judge.
LORELAI: Exactly.
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: Wait a minute. Where are the booths?
SOOKIE: Where are the booths?
LORELAI: I mean, the festival's tomorrow. All I see is hay.
SOOKIE: A ridiculous amount of hay.
MISS PATTYS – TOWN MEETING
[Lorelai and Sookie enter as people start to gather]
LORELAI: Huh!
SOOKIE: Wow! It's crowded.
LORELAI: Yeah full house, huh?
APRIL: Lorelai!
LORELAI: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey I'm gonna go find Jackson. I'll save you a seat.
LORELAI: Okay. April, hi! [They hug as Luke and April come over] How you guys doing?
APRIL: Oh, I'm fabulous.
LORELAI: Fabulous. So how is New Mexico treating you? You had any interesting encounters with UFOs lately?
APRIL: Oh, tons, but you know what they say – "What happens in Roswell stays in Roswell."
LORELAI: Hmm. Do they say that?
LUKE: Well, she does.
LORELAI: Wow, someone got their ears pierced. Glamorous.
APRIL: Thank you.
LUKE: Someone's growing up fast, huh?
LORELAI: NO kidding.
APRIL: I can hear you guys, you know. I'm getting our seat.
LUKE: Alright I'll be right there.
APRIL: See you later, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Bye, hon. Oh. So...
LUKE: So, how's the Inn?
LORELAI: Good. It's, uh, full of spring flingers.
LUKE: Oh, I bet.
LORELAI: How's the diner?
LUKE: Uh, same as ever. You know.
LORELAI: Yeah.
[Gavel bangs]
TAYLOR: If everybody would please take their seats, I'll call this meeting to order.
LORELAI: Well, I guess we better…
LUKE: See you later.
LORELAI: Okay.
TAYLOR: Now, I am aware that a small but vocal minority of you have expressed concern about the progress of this year's spring fling festival. I would like to take this time to assure you that everything is going as planned.
[Crowd murmuring, Taylor continues to talk.]
SOOKIE: So, how was it with Luke?
LORELAI: Um... polite, succinct, fine.
SOOKIE: Good.
LORELAI: Yeah.
TAYLOR: …well it is Babette, I assure you there's nothing to worry about.
BABETTE: But what about our booths? We don't have our booths!
TAYLOR: Everything is under control. Take, for instance, the hay-bale maze. It's coming along wonderfully.
LUKE: It's taking over the whole town.
TAYLOR: What do you mean?
JACKSON: There's hay everywhere. I haven't seen so much hay since... I have never in my life seen so much hay.
[Crowed agrees]
TAYLOR: Would everyone please take a handful of chill pills?
GYPSY: Where the hell is my damn lemonade booth?
TAYLOR: You don't need to worry about your lemonade booth.
GYPSY: Why not? The festival is tomorrow, and I have to start squeezing my lemons, and I don't have my equipment or my booth.
TAYLOR: You don't have to worry about that, gypsy, because you don't need to squeeze lemons because you don't need lemonade. Because there isn't going to be a lemonade booth this year.
[Crowed mumbling again]
GYPSY: What?!
TAYLOR: The budget for the lemonade booth has been reallocated to the hay-bale maze.
BABETTE: What about Morey's salty nuts?! How's he supposed to have his salty nuts booth if we don't have a lemonade booth? If people start eating salty nuts and they don't have easy access to lemonade, their mouths will fall off.
TAYLOR: Well you don't have to worry about that, Babette, because there's not going to be a salty nuts booth because the budget for the salty nuts booth has been reallocated to the hay-bale maze.
BABETTE: What?!
[Crowd murmuring]
LORELAI: He spent the entire budget on the hay-bale maze.
SOOKIE: No.
TAYLOR: I put the entire budget into the hay-bale maze.
SOOKIE: No!
LORELAI: Taylor, you can't do that. I have an inn full of guests who've come here, traveled miles, withstood winter, who blow-dried their tongues off their swing sets so they could get to the spring fling.
TAYLOR: Yes.
LORELAI: They expect certain things, the traditional events -- pie-eating contests, pony rides. They don't want just a hay-bale maze and nothing else.
TAYLOR: Feast your eyes on this bad boy.
MICHEL: Taylor!
LUKE: That goes right up to my diner. It's blocking my entire diner.
BABETTE: I don't get it. Is it a race?
TAYLOR: You people clearly don't understand the long and rich history of mazes. Ladies and gentlemen of stars hollow, perhaps this will help.
[Taylor uncovers someone standing in a costume with a cow's head]
LORELAI: Oh, my god.
GYPSY: What the hell is that?
KIRK: I am the Minotaur!
LORELAI: The weird thing is he's been in that head under that velvet cloth this whole time.
KIRK: Although the word "labyrinth" is used interchangeably with "maze," maze scholars insist upon a distinction.
BABETTE: Hey, Kirk! What's with the cow's head?
TAYLOR: Where are you people going?
KIRK: A labyrinth is a universal maze, a maze without branches, without choices...
LUKE: You ready?
TAYLOR: This is important. The Minotaur is speaking.
KIRK: ...Blind alleys down which to proceed. Now, the first maze in recorded history...
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
BABETTE: People are gonna miss your salty nuts, baby. They are.
MOREY: Yeah.
[Babette, Morey, Lorelai and Sookie, stop to see a crane lifting the gazebo.]
LORELAI: Insane.
SOOKIE: Insane.
LORELAI: Insane.



LORELAI'S HOUSE – FRONT DOOR
LORELAI: Hi, I'm home!
RORY: We're in here!
LORELAI: We got a new Thai menu that looks kind of promising. I don't know where Jessington way is, though… or never mind. I am -- I am shocked. I-I'm shocked to find there's cooking going on in here.
RORY: It is shocking, isn't it?
LOGAN: We're making paella.
LORELAI: Paella? Who can even spell paella, let alone make it? That smells good.
LOGAN: Can I get you wine? We have red and white.
RORY: Yeah and in paella, there's chicken, sausage, and shrimp. So anything goes.
LORELAI: Uh, red, please.
RORY: How was the town meeting?
LOGAN: Oh yeah, how was Taylor?
RORY: Logan's fascinated with Taylor.
LOGAN: He's fascinating.
LORELAI: He's insane. He is ripping out the gazebo with a crane.
RORY: What? What do you mean?
LORELAI: He's ripping out the gazebo with a crane. He thinks that it defeats the purpose of the maze if we can still see a town landmark.
RORY: Wait. I cannot believe that he is doing that. That gazebo has been there since Paul Revere was a baby boy.
LORELAI: I know. So what can I do? How can I help?
LOGAN: You can chop peppers.
LORELAI: Peppers. Those are the -- oh, right. Hey, how do you know how to make paella?
LOGAN: Well, when I was a junior at Exeter or -- no, sorry, Andover -- I did a semester abroad in Spain.
LORELAI: Spain -- wow.
[Cell phone rings]
RORY: Oh! I think that's me. [on the phone from the living room] Hello?…
LORELAI: Um so, I heard you had a really tough business deal. I'm sorry about that.
LOGAN: Oh, yeah, that's the way it goes. You know these things happen. A business is like an ocean. You just got to surf it.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] Right. Um, but Rory said you're working on some new ideas. How's that going?
LOGAN: Great. Really great. It's an exciting time. This is the real dot-com renaissance. Everything's changing from the way media is sourced to the way we buy things to what we buy. All the restrictions of the brick-and-mortar retail mall are gonna be a thing of the past.
LORELAI: Hmm.
LOGAN: Oh, yeah, it's way beyond Amazon and eBay now. It's kind of like what's going on with these simulation games, like "Second Life" or "World of Warcraft." Actual currency is being exchanged for virtual goods.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah?
LOGAN: I mean theoretically, I could make a fortune selling virtual Lightsabers or something on "Everquest 2"
LORELAI: Whatever happened to selling encyclopedias? Not virtual enough, I guess.
LOGAN: Ideas are really my commodity. With the experience I have and the contacts I've gained, I really feel with the right idea, boom, I could be right back on top.
LORELAI: Hmm.
RORY: Oh, my god. I got it! I got the job!
LORELAI: Oh, my god, honey! I can't believe it!
LOGAN: I can.
LORELAI: I knew you were gonna get it.
RORY: It's a real writing job!
LORELAI: A real writing job!
RORY: I mean I'd have a salary and a desk and maybe even an office. Well, not an office, but she did say something about a desk and a salary and a 401k, and I have to tell her yes or no by Monday. Oh my God.
LOGAN: Oh, I'm so proud of you, Ace.
LORELAI: Oh, honey!
RORY: Someone actually wants to pay me to write.
LORELAI: We need to celebrate.
[They each get a drink]
LOGAN: Absolutely.
LORELAI: All right, to you.
RORY: Cheers.
LORELAI: You know what this calls for.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Paella.
LOGAN: [Laughs]
RORY: Yes.
STARS HOLLOW – NIGHT TIME
[Lorelai, Rory and Logan walk past the hay-bale maze]
RORY: It's a good job.
LORELAI: It is.
LOGAN: Absolutely.
RORY: It's a really good job. I can't really imagine living in Providence, Rhode island. I mean I don't think there's a lot going on there.
LOGAN: Well, there's Brown. It's a pretty cool college town.
RORY: Yeah which would be great if I hadn't just spent the last four years in college at a college town. It is a great paper, though. I guess that's the part to focus on.
LOGAN: It's an excellent paper.
RORY: But it's kind of small.
LORELAI: Well you could be the big fish in the small pond.
RORY: Yeah which means I would actually get to write some articles, which would be great. But I don't know. Is it better to be a small fish in a pond where I'm gonna learn more and have career-advancement opportunities?
LORELAI: You don't have to decide until Monday, and between now and then, you can eat a lot of pie.
RORY: Yes, if we ever make it to Weston's.
LORELAI: Seriously.
LOGAN: Yeah, where is this Weston's of yours?
RORY: Normally, it's not far away, but all this hay's blocking all the parking spots. It's too much hay.
LORELAI: Yeah well, we're burning off a lot of calories, so thank goodness you ordered an extra pie.
RORY: Two extra pies, actually.
LORELAI: Nice!
RORY: To be quite honest, this is one of the best jobs I could imagine getting.
LORELAI: That's really great.
RORY: I know, but it's just one of, you know? It's not the best. It's just... [Sighs] I don't know. I mean, if I take this job, I'm giving up the chance at the Reston fellowship.
LOGAN: Which you really, really want.
RORY: I'd be giving up The New York Times, you know? But then, is it idiotic to give up a great job for this chance at another job? Not even a job. The fellowship's only a six-week paid internship.
LOGAN: Yeah but if the fellowship is your dream, I don't know I guess people should go for their dreams.
LORELAI: Yes, honey, I want all your dreams to come true.
LOGAN: You got to go for it sometimes. Screw the 401k.
LORELAI: Oh, well, not everyone can live in that dream world.
LOGAN: It's not in a dream world, necessarily.
LORELAI: Yes, it is, if you're talking about following your whims and neglecting financial security.
LOGAN: I'm not saying to neglect financial security.
LORELAI: Okay.
LOGAN: Not at all. When you're 22, I don't think a 401k needs to be your top priority. That's all I'm saying.
LORELAI: Right, well, all I'm saying is food costs money and rent costs money and a salary gives you money, so that can be a good thing.
LOGAN: I agree. I'm aware of the reality of money.
LORELAI: Okay.
RORY: All right you guys figure out my future. I'm gonna go pick up these pies.
LORELAI: Okay.
LOGAN: I just got my first credit-card statement. I'm very much aware of the reality of money.
LORELAI: You just got your first credit-card statement?
LOGAN: Earning money is great. It's just not everything.
LORELAI: No, I agree.
LOGAN: And I think in this particular situation, Rory should take the gamble.
LORELAI: The gamble? Rory's not a gambler, you know? She's a thoughtful, deliberate decision maker.
LOGAN: I know that.
LORELAI: You're a gambler, but that's not her.
RORY: Okay, cherry pie, banana-cream pie, and strawberry-rhubarb pie.
LORELAI: Great!
RORY: I just figured, if we're gonna do pie, we might as well do pie.
LOGAN: Let's do pie.
LORELAI: Let's do pie.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S BEDROOM
[Late night Logan is wakes up.]
LOGAN: What you doing awake, Ace?
RORY: Oh, I'm sorry.
LOGAN: Oh, a pro/con list. Classic Rory Gilmore pro/con list.
RORY: There's so many factors!
LOGAN: Yeah.
RORY: What about all the other newspapers that have my résumé, you know? Taking this job means rejecting all those other possibilities. I should factor that in.
LOGAN: Yeah.
RORY: Or what about the very real possibility that print journalism is a dying animal? I should factor that in as a pro, because newspaper jobs might become increasingly rare, and I should snap up what I can get, but also as a con, because I should be careful about getting too entrenched in what could become an anachronistic medium.
LOGAN: Mm-hmm. [Reading the list on the laptop.] "Pro -- air quality in Providence as compared to air quality in Manhattan. Con -- Chinese-food quality in Providence as compared to Chinese-food quality in Manhattan." You need to go to sleep. [Closing the laptop]
RORY: Oh, no, but these are pivotal hours. I mean these are the hours when I'm gonna make my decision.
LOGAN: You need sleep, haven't you ever heard of the expression "sleep on it"?
RORY: But…
LOGAN: We can do a pro/con list about you doing a pro/con list, but I say we do it in the morning.
RORY: I guess I am kind of tired.
LOGAN: I bet.
RORY: [Yawns] What are you doing there, babe?
LOGAN: [Grunts] Just trying to get my pants on and get some water.
RORY: Oh, yeah? Some water? With your pants?
LOGAN: Yeah, I don't want to go out there without pants.
RORY: You need to put a shirt on to get water?
LOGAN: Yeah what if your mom's out there? I don't want her thinking I'm David Hasselhoff or something.
RORY: She's not gonna think you're David Hasselhoff. Socks? Logan, she's not gonna think anything weird. I promise.
LOGAN: Socks without shoes looks ridiculous. I'll be right back, sweetie.
RORY: All right, good night, David Hasselhoff.
[Rory turns out the light, Logan gets a glass and makes his way to the sink as Lorelai turns on the light.]
LORELAI: Oh.
LOGAN: Oh, hey.
LORELAI: Hi.
LOGAN: I'm sorry. I didn't wake you, did I?
LORELAI: No, I was... craving some pie, but you know what? I'm not -- I'm not hungry.
LOGAN: I just needed some water.
LORELAI: That's okay. I'll...see you in the morning.
LOGAN: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Yeah?
LOGAN: I want you to know I'm not a gambler.
LORELAI: Okay.
LOGAN: Look, I know that Rory tells you stuff, and you know all these things about me, like I know you know I went to Vegas and all that, and I just I want you to know that's not who I am. I don't want you to be worried.
LORELAI: Well... I am worried. I'm a mom. That's what we do.
LOGAN: Okay well, what exactly are you worried about?
LORELAI: Okay. I'm worried that you're not worried enough. You take things lightly. This whole "you got to surf the waves" attitude. "Cowabunga, dude." I mean, you just lost millions of dollars.
LOGAN: I know. I know I did, believe me. And I don't feel "Cowabunga, dude" inside. Believe me, I know I made a big mistake.
LORELAI: You do?
LOGAN: Yeah. But I don't want to act like that in front of you. I mean, for one thing, the whole self-flagellation thing -- it's kind of embarrassing, and I just I want you to think well of me.
LORELAI: All right, well... it's good for me to know. It's good for me to know that you know you made a mistake.
LOGAN: I made a mistake. I messed up. I really messed up.
LORELAI: Okay. I think 401k's are important. I think responsibility and paying your bills and dealing with reality is important.
LOGAN: Ah well, I'm beginning to learn about reality. I grew up with a lot of privilege.
LORELAI: Right you had that whole silver-spoon-in-the-mouth thing, and that's not how I raised Rory.
LOGAN: I know that.
LORELAI: This was not a silver-spoon household. This was Spork city all the way.
LOGAN: I get that, and I respect that because I just spat out a whole place setting of sterling silver royal Danish. I left my dad's company, I left that world because I have my own values.
LORELAI: I understand that.
LOGAN: I thought you would because that's what you did. You left the world of privilege to do things your way.
LORELAI: I guess I never thought of it that way.
LOGAN: And you did it when you were younger and had a baby to take care of. It was really impressive.
LORELAI: I don't need you to be impressed by me. I just need you to know it wasn't easy.
LOGAN: I know that.
LORELAI: I didn't get anything like "boom," you know? I worked hard for everything I got.
LOGAN: I want to work. I'm ready to work. And I want to work hard.
LORELAI: All right, then.
LOGAN: All right, then.
LORELAI: Since we're up, do you think we should have some pie?
LOGAN: Yeah.
LORELAI: Really?
LOGAN: Yeah.
LORELAI: You think we should have some vanilla ice cream on it?
LOGAN: That's my favorite. I love vanilla ice cream.
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
[Piano playing b*at tune as people run through the hay-bale maze, A group from the Dragonfly Inn get off a bus.]
KID: Are there any people chasing you?
MS SINCLAIR: No, it's just a maze -- a maze made out of hay.
KID: And there's no people jumping out at you with, like, squirt g*n?
MRS SINCLAIR: I don't think so sweetie it's just a maze, but it's made out of hay!
KID: So, wait a minute. There's no lights or fireworks? It's really just a maze made out of hay? What a drag.
MICHEL: You're preaching to the choir.
LOGAN: Well, I can't believe we're finally here at the maze.
RORY: It's all I've dreamed since I could dream.
LOGAN: Oh man there is just something about being in a maze of hay. It's so much fun!
RORY: Totally.
LOGAN: Oh man, am I glad I got out of that waterslide park so I could come to the hay-bale maze!
LORELAI: Take it down, Olivier.
LOGAN: Not buying the waterslide thing?
LORELAI: Well, just keep it real. Well, the hay-bale maze is gonna be really fun, and then afterwards, Sookie has prepared hot dogs and funnel cakes and salty nuts -- all the festival classics.
KID: You like hay-bale mazes?
LOGAN: Oh, yeah, I'm crazy about them.
KID: That's cool.
MRS SINCLAIR: Co o on, let's go!
LORELAI: Hey, thanks.
LOGAN: No problem.
LORELAI: Wow, look at that. You think maybe Taylor was right?
RORY: Bite your tongue.
LOGAN: That man is a genius.
BABETTE: Whoa!
LORELAI: Hi, guys.
BABETTE: That was, "whoa!" Right, babe?
MOREY: Whoa.
LORELAI: Oh, you okay?
MOREY: The maze. Just high on the maze.
BABETTE: [Laughs as they leave.]
[Taylor at the entrance of the maze.]
TAYLOR: Let's go, people. Keep it moving. [Sneezes] Damn allergies. [Sniffles] All right, next 10 can go. [Sniffling] Uh, no gum, no matches, no pushing, no shoving.
KIRK: No running in the maze!
TAYLOR: Oh, and if you get lost in the maze, don't panic, just stand still, wave your hands, and the, uh, maze guard will find you.
LORELAI: Oh I'm gonna say hi to Sookie and Jackson. I'll be right back. [Walks over to them] Hey, kids. Hi, you guys. Did the kids like the maze?
JACKSON: The kids loved the maze.
SOOKIE: We loved the maze.
LORELAI: Really?
SOOKIE: [Laughs] Yeah, it's really fun.
LORELAI: But it has no fireworks, no lights, no guys with squirt g*n. Why is it so fun?
JACKSON: It's just cool!
[Back to Rory and Logan]
LOGAN: You know when you were making that pro/con list?
RORY: Yeah?
LOGAN: I kind of noticed there was something on there about me.
RORY: Oh. Yeah. I didn't know where to put you.
LOGAN: Yeah, I was that, I saw you wrote "Logan," and then there were like three question marks.
RORY: Well, there were just so many factors. And I wasn't sure to what extent I should factor you in.
LOGAN: Well, I want you to know I don't want you to factor me in.
RORY: Oh. Okay.
LOGAN: No. I mean... I'm not sure exactly what I'm gonna be doing next, and I know I want to start putting my ideas out, and I know I want to start working, but I think you should do what you want to do, and then -- and then maybe I'll factor you in.
RORY: Oh. You want to factor me in.
LOGAN: Yeah. I'd like that. If you're in providence, maybe I'll come live in providence.
RORY: That would be great. But just, in general, I'd like to factor you in, too.
LOGAN: Okay. But for this one, you make your decision based on what you want for you. You do what you want.
RORY: Okay. You know what I really want?
LOGAN: What's that?
RORY: I want to go for the fellowship. I'm gonna say no to the pro jo.
LOGAN: Okay.
RORY: Yeah, I'm gonna go for it. Okay.
TAYLOR: Okay, next group! No gum, no matches, no pushing, no shoving. If you get lost in the maze, wave to the man on stilts. You're good to go.
RORY: Mom, you want to come with us?
LORELAI: Uh, no, go ahead.
[In the maze Rory and Logan walk hand in hand, that come to a fork, look at each other, and go right.]
LUKE'S DINER
LUKE: You got the tuna there?
APRIL: Tuna on rye, tuna on wheat, mayo, no mayo respectively.
LUKE: [on the phone] Yeah. No. No, delivery time hasn't changed. Yeah. No, no, no, the maze hasn't changed anything. Okay, all right. Uh, French dip, ham and Swiss, fries, fries, onion rings, roast beef, BLT, BLT no "B," BLT no "T," turkey on rye, burger. Yep. No. No problem. [hangs up phone]
ZACH: Okay.
LUKE: "Okay" what?
ZACH: Okay I've got something to tell you.
LUKE: I don't have time for dramatic pauses Zach.
ZACH: I've mastered the maze. I have. At first, I thought I had to go around the maze to make the deliveries, but, dude, it's easier to go through the maze.
LUKE: Great, Zach.
ZACH: I know. At first, I wrote it down, you know the path, but I don't need it because it's all up here, or in here. Check it out, eyes closed -- it goes left, right, right, left, left, left, right. Wait. Left, left, right…
APRIL: Don't give it away. I am dying to go through the maze. I bet it's fabulous.
ZACH: It so is.
LUKE: Go.
APRIL: Go?
LUKE: GO through the maze.
APRIL: Don't you need help here?
LUKE: No, no, go ahead. I don't need you.
APRIL: Bye, dad.
LUKE: Have a fabulous time.
CAESAR: I got a patty-melt burger well-done, Pastrami on rye, chili dog, and three orders of fries.
ZACH: I'm good to go, man. You know what I'm gonna do?
LUKE: I can't begin to imagine.
ZACH: I'm gonna go through the maze at night, all alone, me, a blindfold. You know how I can do it?
LUKE: How's that?
ZACH: I can smell the hay.
LUKE: We can all smell the hay.
ZACH: No, dude. I can smell the hay.
MAZE
[Lorelai alone finding her way, taking a few wrong turns and back tracking, looking a little lost.]
LORELAI: Oh, god! Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: "Hey." Hay.
[They both laugh]
LORELAI: Oh, you got snacks.
LUKE: Yeah, well, Zach forgot these. The hay's kind of gone to his head. Anyway he gave me these directions here.
LORELAI: [Gasps]
LUKE: So I just go right, left…what?
LORELAI: What is that?
LUKE: Oh! April gave it to me.
LORELAI: You have a bracelet on your wrist.
LUKE: She's into jewelry. It's just a phase. What could I do?
LORELAI: Uh, wow!
LUKE: [Laughs] It's just one of these crazy phases. I was just getting used to the fact I had a daughter. Now all of a sudden, I have a teenager. It's wild. Time just goes by.
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: I'm sorry.
LUKE: Yeah, I'm, uh -- I'm sorry, too.
LORELAI: No, no, let me go first.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: I messed up. That night I went to Christopher -- I'm sorry.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: I mean I never admitted it to you that it was wrong what I did, and it was, and I'm really sorry.
LUKE: Okay. Thanks.
LORELAI: [Sighs] I don't know why I didn't say this before.
LUKE: Ah. You know... I'm sorry, too, 'cause... I don't know, it's just... now that I've had April, it's... I've learned a lot, and I was crazy to think that I had to fix everything in my relationship with April before I could really be with you. And that's just not how you fix things. I mean things just don't stand still. They're always changing.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: I guess I was compartmentalizing? If that's what you call it. I mean I should have opened my compartments. I should have gotten your help.
LORELAI: I wanted to help.
LUKE: I know. And I'm sorry. And I'm sorry, also, because I think I kind of used April to push you away.
LORELAI: You did, huh?
LUKE: Yeah, I think so. I was afraid, and... I'm so sorry.
LORELAI: It's really okay.
LUKE: I'm glad.
LORELAI: Me too.
LUKE: Well, I got some fries that are getting cold.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, well, I got to find my way out of here.
LUKE: By the way, you're really close. Just go left, two rights, and you're out.
LORELAI: Thanks.
TROUBADOUR: [singing] Nothing's gonna break your heart today nothing's gonna steal your light away no even when the skies are turning gray…

LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai waits for a minuter outside before entering, Babette and Miss Patty are surprised to see Lorelai.]
LORELAI: Hey [Chuckles to Kirk as she sits at the counter]
KIRK: Well, well, well I always suspected this day would come.
LORELAI: Hi Kirk.
KIRK: You're not getting this seat back.
LORELAI: Huh?
KIRK: You can't, it's mine now and frankly I can see why you hogged it for so long.
LORELAI: What?
KIRK: It's clearly the best stool in the joint. Close to the cash register and the kitchen, which guarantees plenty of face time with the boss. Climate wise it's positioned between two air-conditioning vents which creates a nice cross ventilation…
LORELAI: Hey Kirk…
KIRK: …never.
LORELAI: You can have the seat. Hey [To Luke]
LUKE: Hey. [Short pause] Coffee?
LORELAI: Yes please.
LUKE: All right, ah to stay or to go?
LORELAI: Um… To stay.
LUKE: Good, okay.
MISS PATTY: Lorelai.
BABETTE: Hi ya doll.
LORELAI: Hey.
MISS PATTY: It's so nice seeing you back in here.
LORELAI: Thanks.
BABETTE: Been a long time.
LORELAI: Yah.
BABETTE: What 9, 10 months.
LORELAI: Something like that.
KIRK: Actually I can tell you exactly when Lorelai was in her last ‘cause I marked it in my calendar. [Looks it up] "May 22, 2006, stool available?" it's important to…
LUKE: Enough Kirk, here you go.
LORELAI: Thank you. [Exhales] So how's it going?
LORELAI: Oh really well. They inn is really busy.
LUKE: Yeah I'll bet.
LORELAI: And so how are you doing.
LUKE: Me? Good, really good.
[Still awkward between them]
LORELAI: Good.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Um, it sure is warm outside.
LUKE: Yeah you know when I opened the diner this morning I remember thinking how warm it was.
LORELAI: Really!
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: You know what maybe I should take this to go. To get back to work and.
LUKE: Yeah okay let me just get you a cup.
LORELAI: It's been really busy at the Inn.
LUKE: Yeah. Yeah you said. There you go.
[Lorelai pours the coffee into the to go cup and Luke puts a lid on it.]
LUKE: Lid on there.
LORELAI: Oh great.
[Lorelai gets money to pay]
LUKE: Nah, I got it.
LORELAI: Thanks.
LUKE: Okay so I'll see you around.
LORELAI: Definitely, I'll see you around. Okay.
[Lorelai starts to leave the diner.]
LORELAI: Bye.
MISS PATTY: Bye.
[Outside Lorelai exhales in relief.]
OPENING CREDITS
UNKNOWN ROAD
[Lorelai is driving the Jeep. Her cell phone rings]
LORELAI: Hi.
SOOKIE: Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
LORELAI: You called me.
SOOKIE: Oh, no, not you. I was talking to Davey. Hey.
LORELAI: Hey.
SOOKIE: I was just calling to let you know I'm not coming into work today. [To Davey] No, no, no, no, no itching. No itching. Just pat, pat. Par, pat.
LORELAI: Is everything okay?
SOOKIE: Oh, everything's fine. I just hate that stupid Rosie Milano.
LORELAI: Ugh, is she the woman at Davey's school with the big, fake boobs who all the dads think are real?
SOOKIE: No, but I hate her, too. Rosie Milano is a little girl in Davey's class.
LORELAI: Oh. Interesting choice for your nemesis.
SOOKIE: She came to school with the chicken pox.
LORELAI: Oh, no, I hate her, too. Davey and Martha?
SOOKIE: Yeah. I mean, not terrible cases. They've both been vaccinated, but I'm up to my ears in oatmeal baths. Plus I've got to find a hotel for Jackson because the inn is completely full -- "go, us," by the way.
LORELAI: Why does Jackson need to stay in a hotel?
SOOKIE: He's never had the chicken pox. I mean I know he's already been exposed, so he may get them anyway, but if there's a chance in hell to avoid him getting them, I'm gonna do it because that man is a huge baby.
LORELAI: Well he doesn't need to stay at a hotel, he can just stay at my place.
SOOKIE: Lorelai, you are my best friend in the entire world. I could not sic Jackson on you.
LORELAI: Oh, please.
SOOKIE: No, the man's a slob. This morning, I could have k*ll him, with the wet towels all over the floor.
LORELAI: It's so not a big deal. Why waste money on a hotel?
SOOKIE: Are you sure?
LORELAI: Yes. Please, end of discussion. He's staying with me.
SOOKIE: Okay, well, thank you, and I want you to remember this moment because you offered.
LORELAI: Okay, well...
SOOKIE: Okay. Well, I'm gonna pick him up and bring him over to you around 6:00.
LORELAI: Yeah, that sounds good. Hey, so I went into Luke's this morning.
SOOKIE: What? Why didn't you cut me off? It's not like the kids have bubonic plague. How did it go?
LORELAI: It was awful.
SOOKIE: Oh!
LORELAI: Yeah everybody was staring at us.
SOOKIE: Oh, I'm sure they weren't.
LORELAI: Sookie.
SOOKIE: Yeah, they were staring.
LORELAI: Yeah it was just awkward, and neither of us knew how to act.
SOOKIE: I'm sure it seemed worse than it really was.
LORELAI: Uh, no. We hit the weather in the first minute.
SOOKIE: Ohh. Well, it has been unseasonably warm, but you know things will get better.
LORELAI: I don't know. Maybe there's just too much history.
SOOKIE: Oh, history, schmistory. Couples have been breaking up and becoming friends. I mean look at Ryan O'neal and Farrah Fawcett, huh?
LORELAI: Really Ryan and Fawcett that's the most well-adjusted relationship you can come up with?
SOOKIE: I mean I'm sorry. He's been in the news lately -- that whole g*n thing.
LORELAI: Hey, s-- oh! God.
[The Jeep starts making unusual sounds]
SOOKIE: What was that?
LORELAI: I don't know.
SOOKIE: Oh!
LORELAI: Oh! It's coming from my car.
SOOKIE: Pull over.
LORELAI: I am.
SOOKIE: Pull over! Pull over! Pull over!
LORELAI: I am. I am. I-I've pulled over. Hold on. I'm turning it off.
SOOKIE: Are you okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, I think so.
SOOKIE: Well, what was that?
LORELAI: You know, the carburetor?
SOOKIE: Oh. Ooh, or maybe the alternator.
LORELAI: I think I better call Gypsy.
SOOKIE: That's probably a good idea.
LORELAI: Okay, bye.
SOOKIE: Bye.
[The brake lights on the Jeep flicker and go out]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT.
[Paris is sitting at the table when the front door opens.]
PARIS: Finally. Doyle, she's here! Where were you? Your "20th century poets" class ended two hours ago.
DOYLE: Hey, Rory.
RORY: Hey, Doyle. I was just dropping Logan off at the airport.
DOYLE: Oh yeah he has that meeting in San Fran. When is it?
RORY: Tomorrow afternoon.
DOYLE: Wish him luck for me.
RORY: I will.
PARIS: Seriously, you're gonna stand here making idle chitchat on the single most important day of my life?
DOYLE: Sorry, sweetie. Paris has some news.
PARIS: Not some news, the news. Responses from Harvard medical school, Johns Hopkins school of medicine, Penn medical, Yale law school, Stanford law school, and Columbia medical. And before you comment on envelope thickness, keep in mind that so much stuff is online these days that thickness is no longer an accurate indicator.
RORY: Mm-hmm
PARIS: I knew you would want to be here, when I opened them.
RORY: Yeah, right. Thanks.
DOYLE: Go on, hon. Do it!
PARIS: [Sighs] Okay. My lucky letter opener. Used it to open the envelope conveying my acceptance to Yale four years ago. And don't look at me like I'm some kind of superstitious freak. It's just a precautionary device. If it works, great. If not, I need it to open letters anyway. I don't know which to open first. Choose one.
RORY: Okay, uh... Yale law school.
PARIS: Yale law school. Okay, wow. That's a great school. I'd be lucky to get in there, you know? You open it.
RORY: Me?
PARIS: You're lucky.
RORY: I am?
PARIS: How else do you explain the fact that you got into Harvard and I didn't?
RORY: Oh, right, luck. Okay.
PARIS: Use the letter opener!
RORY: Oh. Are you sure the letter opener's luck isn't gonna cancel out my luck?
PARIS: I don't know, is that how it works?
RORY: I was kidding. Sorry. Here we go. All right. "Dear Paris Geller, we are pleased to inform you --"
PARIS: I got in! Whoo!
[Paris and Doyle screaming]
RORY: Congratulations! I'm so happy for you.
PARIS: Thank you. Thank you so much for your participation in operation finish line, for your friendship, for everything. You've always been an inspiration to me, Rory Gilmore.
RORY: Aw.
PARIS: I mean, the way you cut your ruthless path to the head of the Yale daily news and never looked back -- I never told you, but I really admired that.
RORY: Thanks?
PARIS: And, Doyle, I know this process didn't exactly bring out my soft and fuzzy side.
DOYLE: Doesn't matter. I love you, baby, and I am so proud of you.
PARIS: I love you, too. I just can't believe I got into the second best law school in the country. It's such an honor! It doesn't matter really if I get into the others. I have a great option right here.
RORY: You do.
PARIS: Yeah! Anyway, go ahead. Might as well open Harvard, even though it doesn't matter. Use the letter opener again.
RORY: Okay. [opens the letter] Okay. "We are pleased to inform…"
PARIS: Whoo! [Very excited again] I got in! I got in!
DOYLE: All right!
RORY: Congratulations!
PARIS: Bite me, Harvard, bite me!
DOYLE: Yeah, chock on it!
PARIS: I'm tempted to reject them the same way they rejected me that dark day four years ago. Who's laughing now?!
RORY: Okay, um, so, next we have, what? The university of Pennsylvania? All right. Let's see what it says. [Chuckles] All right. "We are pleased to inform…"
PARIS: In? I'm in? Yes!
Excited but a little less than before]
DOYLE: Oh!
PARIS: What's that about?
RORY: Hmm?
PARIS: Your noticeable drop-off in enthusiasm. Is that a reflection of the fact that you're less impressed by my admission to the university of Pennsylvania school of medicine than you were by my other acceptances?
RORY: I'd say we're just as impressed. Wouldn't you, Doyle?
DOYLE: Oh, absolutely. Because it's a pre-eminent institution in the interrelated disciplines of patient-care education and research.
RORY: It's a great school.
DOYLE: Mm, top-notch.
PARIS: Fine, you've made your point. Perception should play a role in my decision-making process.
RORY: Well I guess that's what Doyle and I were saying.
PARIS: I mean lets face it, you say "Harvard medical school," and people are automatically impressed, and that counts for something.
RORY: That's true.
PARIS: SO you think I should go there?
RORY: Oh, well, that's not what I'm saying -- or that you shouldn't. I'm just... What I'm saying is that you have all these great options.
DOYLE: Yeah.
PARIS: I know. So, how do I decide?
DOYLE: Oh, you'll figure it out, hon.
PARIS: How? This is a huge decision, the biggest decision I've had to make in my life. Law school or med school? I have two passions, and obviously, I'm vastly talented in both fields. What muse do I follow? Not to mention location-wise, where do I want to live for the next three or up to eight years? Open the others.
RORY: Yeah? Okay. Columbia.
DOYLE: [Chuckles]
RORY: Also a good school.
DOYLE: Mm-hmm.
RORY: "We are pleased…"
PARIS: Oh, god!
RORY: Paris you're just being silly, okay? It's good to have options.
PARIS: Yeah right you can say that because there's only one thing you want. Talk to me if you don't get the New York Times fellowship and you have to choose between six other papers.
[Rory looks hurt]
PARIS: I'm sorry. I just meant it must be nice to know what you want.
RORY: Well, "nice" -- yeah, that's one way to put it, and "scary" is another.
PARIS: You have a great sh*t at the Reston.
DOYLE: You do and with A.J. Abrams writing that rec...
RORY: Well I'm sure all the candidates have great recommendations.
PARIS: New York Times would be lucky to have you.
RORY: Thanks. Well, I'll find out soon enough, but come on. This is your moment. Should we open another one? All right. [Opens letter] Hey, hey. You got into Stanford!
DOYLE: Whoa! Someone's on a roll!
RORY: Yay!
PARIS: Enough with the hysterics. I have a big decision to make, and all this hooting and hollering isn't exactly helping matters.
[Paris buries her head in a pillow on the couch]
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai's on the phone, the doorbell rings, talking on the phone while answering the door]]
LORELAI: What do you mean you can't fix it, gypsy? It's only eight years old. [To Sookie and Jackson] Hi, come on in. Everyone knows you can fix anything. Sit down. Sorry I have guest, make yourselves at home okay.
SOOKIE: Unh-unh-unh-unh.
JACKSON: Wha…
SOOKIE: Ignore Lorelai.
JACKSON: What?
SOOKIE: You are absolutely not to make yourself at home, don't leave your clothes lying all over the house.
JACKSON: I won't.
SOOKIE: Wipe your shoes off if you go outside and come back in.
JACKSON: I will. Don't leave them laying around in the middle of the room or anywhere where they can be smelled.
JACKSON: Sookie.
SOOKIE: Just don't touch anything, and hang up your wet towels.
JACKSON: I have stayed at other people's houses before.
SOOKIE: I know. Why do you think I'm saying all of this? And just try not to annoy Lorelai.
JACKSON: Believe it or not, I don't try to annoy other people.
SOOKIE: Well congratulations, because you have a natural talent.
JACKSON: Sookie!
SOOKIE: What?
JACKSON: Nothing. Is that all?
SOOKIE: No, I packed you a salad. Eat it in the kitchen at the table on a plate. Please do not make a mess. I wanted to stay around and say thank you to Lorelai, but I should get back to the kids.
JACKSON: Yeah, yeah you should get back to the kids. It sounded like that's gonna take a while.
SOOKIE: Really?
JACKSON: Oh, yeah. They're talking about cars. I mean that phone call could take hours. Go, really.
SOOKIE: Well call me if you need anything.
JACKSON: I will.
SOOKIE: And don't use Lorelai's home phone.
JACKSON: Kiss the kids good night for me.
SOOKIE: I will.
LORELAI: Thanks for trying. Okay. Thank you. Bye. [Sookie leaves just as Lorelai returns from the kitchen] Sorry about that.
JACKSON: Oh! No problem. Thanks again for letting me stay.
LORELAI: Oh, sure, my pleasure. Have a seat. [Hesitating to sit] So, where's Sookie?
JACKSON: Oh you know she had to get back to the kids.
LORELAI: Oh. Well, how's she holding up?
JACKSON: O-okay. A little tense. What's going on with the car?
LORELAI: Gypsy says I have to put it down.
JACKSON: What?
LORELAI: Yes. She said it would be cheaper to get a new one. She used the phrase "total internal destruction."
JACKSON: Wow.
LORELAI: I know. I guess that check-engine light is not just a suggestion.
JACKSON: Not so much.
LORELAI: Although I'm proud. Total internal destruction -- that sounds badass.
JACKSON: So what's next?
LORELAI: Uh, I guess I turn my evil power on some new, unsuspecting vehicle.
JACKSON: Do you know what you're gonna get?
LORELAI: No. Any suggestions?
JACKSON: Honestly, I'm not a car guy, but I can steer you toward a good tractor.
LORELAI: Alright if I decide to get a tractor, you're my guy.
JACKSON: Hey, do you need a ride to work tomorrow? Phil Henderson's gonna pick me up. We could drop you off on the way to the farm.
LORELAI: Well that's nice. What time are you going?
JACKSON: About 4:45.
LORELAI: No, no, no. That's too early. I'll take my bike.
JACKSON: You bike?
LORELAI: Well, I don't bike, but I have a bike. There were about two weeks when Rory was 10 that we were really into biking. Then we got over it and moved on to roller skating, but for those two weeks, it was biking all the way.
JACKSON: 12 years ago?
LORELAI: Is that how long ago it was? Oh, well. I'll be fine. They must have the phrase "it's just like riding a bike" for a reason. Okay, so, I'm gonna get a snack. You want to join me?
JACKSON: Uh, actually, no. Sookie made me a salad.
LORELAI: [Scoffs] I'm making chicken nuggets. I won't tell. Come on.
[Jackson follows like a little boy, dropping his bag on the way]
UNKNOWN ROAD
[Lorelai is riding her cell phone rings, she has a hands free ear piece.]
LORELAI: Hello?
RORY: Hi, mom.
LORELAI: Oh, why so blue?
RORY: I'm not blue.
LORELAI: Come on, talk to me.
RORY: All I said was, "hi, mom."
LORELAI: Are you missing Logan? Is he getting back from San Francisco soon?
RORY: On Friday, but that's not why I'm blue. I'm not even blue. Well, I'm not really blue.
LORELAI: Well, why are you not blue?
RORY: Well, Paris got into six schools yesterday, which means she's definitely going to grad school, and I'm happy for her. I mean, I'm happy for Lucy and Olivia, who signed a lease on an apartment in Manhattan -- well, near Manhattan. And I'm happy for this guy in my Shakespeare class who just got recruited for a think t*nk in Washington.
LORELAI: Wow, that's a lot of happy.
RORY: Yeah, that's just it. All of a sudden, everyone seems to know where they're gonna be next year.
LORELAI: Oh, and you're still waiting to hear?
RORY: Yeah. I mean, I really want the Reston.
LORELAI: And I think you're gonna get it, I really do. But you have other places you're waiting to hear from.
RORY: I know, but to live in New York city and work at the times.
LORELAI: Well, if I say it'll work out, does that help?
RORY: Not really.
LORELAI: Consider it unsaid.
RORY: Thanks.
LORELAI: What kind of think t*nk?
RORY: I know, I know I should have asked, but I temporarily forgot your fascination with think t*nk.
LORELAI: Does the guy have a big forehead? I always picture the t*nk guys with big foreheads.
RORY: No, he has a pretty average-sized forehead. Average to small.
LORELAI: Interesting.
RORY: Mm. Hey, why do you sound out of breath?
LORELAI: I don't know.
RORY: Did you have too much coffee this morning?
LORELAI: Haven't had any. I didn't go to Luke's.
RORY: Oh, I thought you were going for a second run.
LORELAI: Well, maybe tomorrow.
RORY: Mom just do it, I know it's hard, but you guys need to get over this hump.
LORELAI: I promise I'll go back. It's just there's been a lot going on with the car and everything.
RORY: Oh, what did gypsy say?
LORELAI: It's bad.
RORY: Uh-oh.
LORELAI: Doorknobs.
RORY: As in "dead as"?
LORELAI: That's right.
RORY: Why? How?
LORELAI: Oh, ours is not to wonder why.
RORY: But it was so young.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: It just seems like yesterday that we went to pick it out.
LORELAI: Yeah.
Oh. So new car, huh? You should get a DeLorean like in "back to the future."
LORELAI: It's on the list right behind the Batmobile. Although I'm enjoying the whole biking thing.
RORY: What biking thing?
LORELAI: I'm biking to work right now.
RORY: What, now? Mom.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Pull over.
LORELAI: No!
RORY: That's dangerous.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm fine. I've been talking to you with a little ear thingy.
RORY: Well, pull over right now.
LORELAI: Okay, I'm pulling over, pulling over. Okay, I pulled over.
RORY: Yeah, I know you're not. I'm hanging up.
LORELAI: Okay, bye!
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Lorelai is reading a car magazine]
SOOKIE: Hey, anything good?
LORELAI: Um, here's one that comes loaded with an entertainment pkg.
SOOKIE: "Package."
LORELAI: Right. Satellite radio, six-cd changer. I'm just not sure if these are cars or really expensive stereos.
SOOKIE: Ooh, you should get a convertible.
LORELAI: I'm not a convertible person.
SOOKIE: What is a convertible person?
LORELAI: You know, too tan, bad hair.
SOOKIE: [Too a kitchen staff] Hey, don't put the tomatoes in until 10 minutes before you serve. [Gasps] Ooh! How about that little sports car?
LORELAI: Yeah, I don't know, I always feel like sports cars have an attitude, you know like they think they're cooler than other cars.
SOOKIE: That's true, although from where I'm sitting in my minivan, they do seem a lot cooler.
LORELAI: [giggles]
SOOKIE: So, thanks again for, you know, having Jackson. I know how difficult he can be.
LORELAI: Oh, he's great.
SOOKIE: Good. You can tell me the truth. I know he's driving you crazy, right?
LORELAI: He's great. We had fun. We watched TV. He went to bed early. It was fun.
SOOKIE: Oh. He's probably on his good behavior. He woke you up when he got up this morning, didn't he?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: He didn't?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Oh, with all that stomp, stomp, stomping around.
LORELAI: Sookie, is everything okay with you two?
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah, yeah. Fine, fine, fine. He's just kind of getting on my nerves a little, you know. I'm just cranky. The little one's keeping me up at night. So, talk to me. What are you thinking?
LORELAI: How about a mini?
MICHEL: [Entering the room] Oh, how about a Rolls-Royce?
LORELAI: [Sarcastically] Yeah, I'll consider that.
MICHEL: Or a Bentley, Aston Martin, Mercedes, a BMW.
LORELAI: What are you doing, just listing expensive cars?
MICHEL: Take out a second mortgage on your home. It will be worth it.
SOOKIE: Michel, be quiet.
MICHEL: People are impressed by fine automobiles. It's how the world works. Don't look at me like that. I didn't make the rules. I just play by them.
LORELAI: Yeah, but you drive a golf.
MICHEL: Would you like to give me a raise?
SOOKIE: Ignore him! Okay, here's what I want you to do. Close your eyes.
LORELAI: Ooh, fun.
SOOKIE: Now, I want you to imagine your dream car. It can be anything you want. You're backing out of the driveway. You're driving through Stars Hollow. "Good morning, townspeople! Top of the morning to you."
LORELAI: Why am I saying "top of the morning"?
SOOKIE: It doesn't matter what you say. It matters what you're in. Can you see what you're in?
LORELAI: I think I can see it!
SOOKIE: Okay, what kind of car is it?
LORELAI: It's not really a car. It's more of a float.
SOOKIE: A float?
LORELAI: In the shape of a swan, and I'm dressed all in white.
SOOKIE: Okay, that's not a very practical car.
LORELAI: Al right. [Too Michel] What are you looking at?
MICHEL: I was trying to decide if you could pull off a Ferrari. Mm, you can't.
LORELAI: Maybe I'll get a really cool vintage car.
MICHEL: A used car? [Laughs] You cannot be serious.
LORELAI: What's wrong with a used car?
MICHEL: Would you buy a used toilet seat?
LORELAI: It's not really the same thing.
MICHEL: You're sitting in someone else's filth.
LORELAI: With pants on.
MICHEL: One can only hope.
LORELAI: Ew, Michel.
MICHEL: You don't know who drove it before.
LORELAI: No but I think I could have it cleaned.
MICHEL: Aw, you're right and I'm sure they got out all the sweat, body odor, and head lice that a previous owner deposited.
LORELAI: Ew! Shouldn't you be somewhere, like the reception desk?
MICHEL: Suit yourself.
LORELAI: Ew, ew.
SOOKIE: I know. And now if you get a cool old vintage car, I don't think I can sit in it.
LORELAI: Listen, don't worry. I'm getting a new car. I have more money now than I did eight years ago, and I can afford something nice, you know, with all the perks.
SOOKIE: Yeah, that makes sense.
LORELAI: I just don't know where to start.
SOOKIE: I wish I could be more helpful.
LORELAI: You know this is something Luke would be good at.
SOOKIE: Yeah.
LORELAI: I mean, in the old days, you know, before everything, when we were just friends, this is something I'd ask for his help with.
SOOKIE: Well, I mean, maybe you could.
LORELAI: Could I? I couldn't. Could I?
SOOKIE: You're talking. You're friends again.
LORELAI: Well, sort of friends. We have a long way to go.
SOOKIE: Well, you will be eventually.
LORELAI: You think something like this would help us get over the hump?
SOOKIE: Yeah, and you've got a built-in safe topic of conversation.
LORELAI: Yeah. Maybe I will.
SOOKIE: Great. I think it's a great idea.
LORELAI: All right, me too. I'll let you know how it goes.
SOOKIE: Okay, I'll be here. [Phone rings] Ooh. Hello? Hey, Jackson. No. Whoa. Wait a -- wait a minute. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. You did what?
[Lorelai goes outside and dials her cell phone, a horse whinnies in distance]
LORELAI: Hey. It's Lorelai. It's me. Hi. [Chuckles] Are you busy? Um, no, no, no. I just had a -- I had a quick question. It's kind of a favor, really. Um, my car is totally sh*t, and I need to buy a new car, and I just don't know anything about it, and I thought maybe sometime -- and if you don't have time, it's really no big deal -- but ma-- today? Oh...yeah. I mean, it doesn't have to -- sure. Yeah, we'll go look. Um, I don't know, like 1:30? Can you pick me up at the inn? Hey, thanks. Bye.
[Lorelai looks surprised about the call]
UNKNOWN STREET
[Luke and Lorelai are in Luke's truck]
LUKE: I was gonna put the radio on, but it's been pretty static-y lately.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm fine. I don't need music.
LUKE: Yeah? Okay.
LORELAI: Thanks again for agreeing to come.
LUKE: No problem.
LORELAI: And again, I mean, it didn't have to be, you know, today.
LUKE: Oh, no, you know, the diner was slow, and you can't keep riding that bike around.
LORELAI: Why does everyone act like I'm a really bad biker?
LUKE: No, hey, I didn't mean it that way.
LORELAI: I'm just kidding.
LUKE: Oh.
LORELAI: It was a joke.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: So, um, April left, right?
LUKE: Yeah, but she'll be back in June.
LORELAI: Oh, for the big boat trip?
LUKE: Right, right.
LORELAI: That's gonna be fun.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Are you excited?
LUKE: Yeah. [Chuckles]
LORELAI: Oh, good.
[Awkward silence]
LORELAI: You know, I don't mind a little static.
LUKE: I was gonna say, it actually doesn't work that bad.
[Luke tries tuning in the radio]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Rory is coming home as the door opens and Doyle comes out]
SOOKIE: Have a nice life!
RORY: Doyle, is everything okay?
DOYLE: Oh, yeah, everything's great. My girlfriend of 2 1/2 years just broke up with me, but other than that...
RORY: She did? Why?
DOYLE: Who knows? [raising his voice] Maybe because she's psycho!
PARIS: [Screaming from inside the apartment] I am not psycho!
DOYLE: Oh, yes, you are!
RORY: What happened?
PARIS: Take that back!
DOYLE: Ask Paris. [screaming at Paris] I will not take it back because you are a certifiable nut job! [back to Rory] And, hey, if you find out why we broke up, let me know.
RORY: Oh, but, Doyle, where are you gonna go?
DOYLE: Crashing on my metro editor's couch for a couple of days, then I'll be back for my stuff. See you around.
RORY: See you around.
[Rory goes inside]
PARIS: Is he gone?
RORY: Yeah. What happened?
PARIS: We broke up.
RORY: But why?
PARIS: I have a really big decision to make, and I'm not about to let him influence it.
RORY: Was he trying to pressure you into staying in Connecticut next year?
PARIS: Well, no, not overtly, but it was in the air. And statistically, taking into account my geographic and socioeconomic background, the chances of me remaining with my college boyfriend are slim. So how am I gonna feel in 20 years when I look back and realize that I based such a huge decision on some college guy who may or may not make the holiday newsletter cutoff?
RORY: But you love him.
PARIS: Yeah, well, I'll deal.
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: Look, I really don't want to talk about it, okay?
RORY: Okay.
PARIS: The good news is I came up with a point system to evaluate each institution based on faculty, earning potential, location, prestige, and perception of prestige, which I've decided is worth two points. I'm not proud of that but like you taught me with your U. Penn reaction, that's how the world works.
RORY: Well, I'm glad to see you're making progress.
PARIS: As if. Three more acceptances. It's crazy. I mean I always thought that I'd be able to decide between medicine and law based on the quality of schools I was offered entrance to, but at this point, it's a toss-up. Everyone wants me.
RORY: Well, I'm sure you'll make the right decision.
PARIS: Of course I will. What do you think the point system's for?
RORY: Right. So, the mail got here. Anything for me?
PARIS: Nothing from the times.
RORY: [Groans]
PARIS: It'll come.
RORY: Yeah, I know. It's just waiting sucks.
PARIS: Yeah, it does.
[Rory checks the answering machine.]
LUCY: Hey, it's Lucy! I just wanted to give you a heads up for tonight, 8:00 P.M., Rich Man's Shoe. Get ready to toast Glenda. That's what we named our new apartment. I'll tell you why later.
PARIS: They named their new apartment?
RORY: I guess so.
PARIS: Weird. So, you're gonna go?
RORY: Yeah, I was going to. Do you want to come?
PARIS: I might as well. I mean Doyle and I were supposed to see a movie but guess that's not gonna happen.
RORY: Paris, are you okay?
PARIS: Yeah, I'm fine. Trust me, it's not like I've been dying to see "Blades of Glory" anyway. I'd better get started on my phone calls for the alumni surveys.



LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Sookie and Jackson are in the living room looking at the remains on the dollhouse]
PAUL ANKA (the dog): [Whimpering]
JACKSON: I was admiring it, you know? And then I got to thinking that I could make Martha one, so I picked it up to see what the support system was like, only it was heavier than I thought, and, well, I dropped it.
SOOKIE: You dropped it.
JACKSON: Yes. And then I fell on it.
SOOKIE: Jackson.
JACKSON: I was trying to catch it!
SOOKIE: You broke the only thing from Lorelai's childhood that she actually liked!
JACKSON: I know. I know!
SOOKIE: How could you?
JACKSON: It was an accident.
SOOKIE: Well why did you have to touch it?
JACKSON: I told you, I was just looking at it.
SOOKIE: Well, you look with your eyes, not with your hands.
JACKSON: Well, maybe we could, you know, find a similar dollhouse.
SOOKIE: Oh, good idea. Let's just sneak it in in the middle of the night like we did with Davey's goldfish.
JACKSON: I'm just trying to think. Maybe I could try and put it back together?
SOOKIE: Yeah, you're so handy.
JACKSON: Okay, you know what? That's enough.
SOOKIE: What's enough?
JACKSON: I know what this is about, and it's not this dollhouse.
SOOKIE: Of course it is.
JACKSON: No, it's not. This is about me lying to you and you getting pregnant.
SOOKIE: What are you talking about?
JACKSON: All this anger you have toward me. That's where this is coming from.
SOOKIE: It's not. I told you I'm excited about the baby.
JACKSON: I know but that's not the same as forgiving me, which you haven't done.
SOOKIE: Yes, I have.
JACKSON: No, you haven't.
SOOKIE: I have.
JACKSON: You haven't.
SOOKIE: I have.
JACKSON: You haven't.
SOOKIE: Fine, I haven't! Are you happy?
JACKSON: No, I'm not.
SOOKIE: Well... I don't want to be mad. I don't. [sits down on the stairs] It's just that every time my feet hurt or my back gets sore or Davey and Martha have a tantrum or get the chicken pox, I get scared about having a third kid. And then I feel bad for feeling like that, and then I get mad at you for making me feel like that.
JACKSON: I understand. I do. Heck, I'm still mad at myself. It's just that at some point, you are gonna forgive me eventually, right?
SOOKIE: It's just sometimes it feels really overwhelming.
JACKSON: I know, but you got to let me back in.
SOOKIE: I want to. I do.
JACKSON: Okay.
SOOKIE: Okay. You were thinking about making a dollhouse for Martha?
JACKSON: She'd really like that, wouldn't she?
SOOKIE: Yeah. She would. Boy, you really plowed into that thing.
JACKSON: Oh, yeah.
SOOKIE: Hm.
CAR SALE YARD
LORELAI: Hmm.
LUKE: No?
LORELAI: No. Sorry it's taking so long.
LUKE: No, not at all. It's a big purchase. You're buying a car. You should take your time. I mean, I'm sorry if you feel like I'm rushing you.
LORELAI: Oh, you're not.
LUKE: No? Good. Because, you know, I've got plenty of time.
LORELAI: Good, me too.
LUKE: So, um, what didn't you like about that one, specifically, so we can kind of narrow things down?
LORELAI: Um, the whole thing. I don't know. It's a feeling. It's hard to explain like with the wrangler, I just got in and I had a feeling. I didn't get the feeling there.
LUKE: [Clearing throat] Yeah, right.
LORELAI: Huh?
LUKE: Huh.
LORELAI: Hmm.
LUKE: No, no. I just was clearing my throat.
LORELAI: Oh.
LUKE: How about a Prius?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, I can't. Rory has one.
LUKE: She doesn't like it?
LORELAI: No, she does. It's just we made a pact -- no matching cars. You know 'cause it's a slippery slope between matching cars and then matching sweatsuits.
LUKE: [under his breath] Of course.
LORELAI: Huh?
LUKE: I just said, "of course."
LORELAI: Oh, okay. Yeah I'm sorry if this is frustrating for you.
LUKE: Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. It's not frustrating at all. It's fun. But, I mean, look, if you want to leave --
LORELAI: Oh, no, no. No, no, I'm having fun.
LUKE: Good. Good, good, good. So, what about a little hatchback?
LORELAI: Oh! Well, let's see here. [Opens the door and looks in.] Hmm. It's got a power thingy in the console. That could be convenient, you know, if I need to use a hair dryer if I'm running late.
LUKE: That's useful.
[Cell phone rings]
LORELAI: Oh. Excuse me.
LUKE: Yeah okay.
LORELAI: Be right back. [On the phone] Yeah, you know how Jack Bauer should torture t*rrorists? Make them go car shopping with their exes.
SOOKIE: [Still at Lorelai's] Still awkward, huh?
LORELAI: Still? I'm gonna buy a car just to get out of here.
SOOKIE: No, don't. Just leave.
LORELAI: I want to, and I can tell that he wants to, but neither of us want to say that we want to.
SOOKIE: Oh.
LORELAI: Yeah, I don't know how Ryan and Farrah do it, 'cause this whole friendship thing is not working out.
SOOKIE: Oh. It'll be possible, eventually.
LORELAI: I guess. I just can't take it anymore. What's going on?
SOOKIE: Hmm?
LORELAI: You called me.
SOOKIE: Oh! [Chuckles nervously] Well, um, I just wanted to see how things were going, and now you told me -- really, really bad.
LORELAI: Yeah, add about 10 reallys to that.
SOOKIE: Wow, 12. That's, um, wow. [Chuckles nervously] Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later.
LORELAI: Yeah, okay, bye. [puts on a smile before turning to Luke.]
LUKE: Everything okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, great.
LUKE: All right, good. Look, I was talking to the salesman. He said there's a bunch of other models that way.
LORELAI: Great.
LUKE: Okay, so...
[Lorelai is sitting in a new Jeep]
LUKE: Well?
LORELAI: Well.
LUKE: You've been talking about your Jeep all day,
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: Comparing other cars to it.
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: Here it is.
LORELAI: I'm sorry.
LUKE: But I don't understand. It's the same car.
LORELAI: It's not the same car.
LUKE: What do you mean?
LORELAI: What do you mean? It's different.
LUKE: It's not different. It's just a newer model.
LORELAI: No, it's different. The steering wheel, the seats are different, the cup holder.
LUKE: Okay there have been improvements.
LORELAI: They made some changes.
LUKE: Improvements.
LORELAI: Says who?
LUKE: What exactly is bugging you?
LORELAI: It's not bugging me per se. It's just it's different. I don't get that feeling.
LUKE: Oh, for god's sake.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: You're being ridiculous.
LORELAI: Why?
LUKE: You don't buy a car based on a feeling.
LORELAI: No. You don't buy a car based on a feeling.
LUKE: It's not just me. It's the whole rest of the population.
LORELAI: Really? You took a poll, and you know how everyone else buys their car?
LUKE: I don't have to. I already know what they're gonna say.
LORELAI: Well, I am the person buying the car, and so the only opinion that matters is mine.
LUKE: Oh, that is so like you. I mean this is bathroom tiles all over again.
LORELAI: I was right about the tile.
LUKE: No, you weren't.
LORELAI: The tile was too big for the bathroom.
LUKE: Tiles are not too big for a bathroom. You buy the amount of tiles based on their size that fit into the room you are tiling!
LORELAI: So narrow-minded.
LUKE: That's not narrow-minded. Okay it's sane, and here's a news flash for you, okay? Sports cars don't think they're better than other cars. Okay. Hatchbacks don't have SUV inferiority complexes.
LORELAI: Now who's ridiculous?
LUKE: And sedans aren't afraid to get dirty.
LORELAI: You know what I think it is? That you're hungry.
LUKE: What? No.
LORELAI: Sometimes you get like this when you're hungry.
LUKE: I'm not.
LORELAI: I think I have some cookies in here, some Oreos.
LUKE: I'm not and besides I wouldn't eat anything that came out of that bag.
LORELAI: They're in a wrapper.
LUKE: I can't believe you still haven't cleaned that thing out.
LORELAI: Please.
LUKE: How much time do you lose a day looking through that thing? 5, 10 minutes? Multiply that by a year. I bet you'd gain a month if you just took an hour and cleaned it out, but no -- what?
LORELAI: Nothing.
LUKE: You're smiling.
LORELAI: What? No. You've got low blood sugar.
LUKE: I do not have… okay, are you gonna buy a car or not?
LORELAI: Not.
LUKE: Okay can we get out of here, then?
LORELAI: Gladly.
LUKE: And we're not listening to any of that crap on the radio.
LORELAI: It's not crap.
LUKE: Yeah, it's crap.
LORELAI: It's Air Supply. You know what you need a milkshake.
LUKE: We're not stopping for a milkshake.
LORELAI: Okay let's rock, paper, scissors.
LUKE: No, no, no.
LORELAI: So you forfeit?
LUKE: No, I…
[Opens the truck door for her]
LORELAI: Well, that's how it goes. If you don't play the game, then you forfeit.
LUKE: Let's get you in the car.
[Guides Lorelai in]
LORELAI: That means a giant milkshake for you, my friend.
LUKE: We're not stopping.
LORELAI: Chocolate. That's gonna set you up.
LUKE: We're not stopping. Not gonna happen.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR
[Sookie and Jackson are sitting on the front steps, Paul Anka is near them]
LORELAI: Hey, guys.
SOOKIE: Hey, Lorelai.
JACKSON: Hiya.
LORELAI: How's it going?
SOOKIE: Oh, we're just enjoying the afternoon. It's such A...nice day out. Come join us.
LORELAI: Okay.
SOOKIE: Hey, how'd it turn out with Luke?
LORELAI: Oh, he got mad at me.
SOOKIE: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: Oh, it was so great. I mean we've been so polite to each other, and I knew he was frustrated with me, and I was definitely frustrated with him, and finally, he snapped, and we started bickering, and it was nice.
SOOKIE: Ah.
LORELAI: More normal, you know?
SOOKIE: The fighting got you over the hump.
LORELAI: Yeah. I cannot find a car, though.
SOOKIE: Did you see anything you like?
LORELAI: No. I mean kind of, but they all have this new-car smell, which apparently people like, but I don't like it. I like the way my old car smelled and the way the zipper got stuck on the window and the little place where Rory signed her name in permanent marker.
SOOKIE: Lots of memories, huh?
LORELAI: It was the first new car I bought and the car I taught Rory to drive in, and I know I have to move on. I know that whatever new car, tractor, float, I get will be great. It's just been a more emotional experience than I thought.
SOOKIE: Makes sense.
JACKSON: Yeah. It does.
LORELAI: What's wrong with you two?
SOOKIE: We have to tell you something, and it's really bad timing because we're talking about memories, and the thing we have to tell you was associated with a lot of memories, but we have to tell you, so I'm just gonna tell you.
LORELAI: What is it?
SOOKIE: Jackson broke your dollhouse.
LORELAI: [Gasps] Oh. How broke?
SOOKIE: In a box in pieces. Trust me, you don't want to look.
LORELAI: Oh.
JACKSON: I am so sorry.
SOOKIE: No, it's my fault. I had you on edge. I had him on edge. We're both so sorry.
LORELAI: Oh, no, that's okay. It was an accident.
SOOKIE: Well, the good news -- not good news. I mean, the not-quite-so-devastating news is that we found someone online that is apparently a wizard with, you know, restoring dollhouses, and we're driving all the pieces over there tomorrow.
LORELAI: Oh, thanks. I'm sure it'll be fine.
SOOKIE: Yeah, everything can be fixed, huh?
LORELAI: Yeah. Is that why you guys are sitting out here?
SOOKIE: Pretty much.
LORELAI: Oh. You want to head on in?
SOOKIE: Sounds good. [Chuckles, Lorelai and Jackson her Sookie up] Yow.
RICH MAN'S SHOE
[Rory, Paris and Lucy are sitting at the table as Olivia comes back with some food]
LUCY: That's a living room, and our bedrooms will be here.
OLIVIA: We're gonna put partitions up. Aesthetically, Japanese screens would be nice.
LUCY: But privacy-wise, we definitely need partitions.
RORY: Well, it looks great.
LUCY: Oh, it's not great.
OLIVIA: Nowhere near great.
LUCY: What it is, is cheap.
OLIVIA: Which is even better than great since the gallery is paying me $21,000 a year, and I'm gonna have to start paying off student loans. How, I don't know.
LUCY: We'll make a budget. You'll swing it.
OLIVIA: I hope so.
RORY: Is it near the subway?
LUCY: That's the best part. It's right near the "W" then you transfer to the 7 or the "N."
OLIVIA: I wouldn't say it's the best part. It's definitely a schlepp.
LUCY: But it's a doable schlepp.
OLIVIA: Totally doable. If you get the Reston, you should look in our area.
RORY: Oh, I definitely will. Um, hey, is there student housing at Columbia?
LUCY: You got into Columbia?
PARIS: Yeah.
LUCY: You should go! How much fun will it be when we're all in the city?
PARIS: Maybe. Are you gonna finish that? [Drinks the last of Rory's beer.
RORY: Uh, no. Go for it.
LUCY: Olivia, darts?
OLIVIA: You're on. Let's play for the bedroom with the window.
[They leave]
RORY: Paris, are you okay?
PARIS: Me? Yeah, sure.
RORY: Come on.
PARIS: I just miss him, you know. It's hard.
RORY: I know. You didn't have to break up with him, though.
PARIS: Yes. I did.
RORY: Well, if you thought that he was pressuring you, couldn't you have just talked to him about it?
PARIS: He wasn't.
RORY: Well, then why?
PARIS: It was me, okay? Doyle said to make my decision. He said not to worry about him. He said wherever I went, we'd work it out. So I tried, you know, not to think about him, to take him out of the equation, but I couldn't. Every time I tried to evaluate a school, I'd immediately think about it in relation to Doyle. "How close is it to him? "Is there a good newspaper nearby? What will the commute be like?"
RORY: Well, those are all valid questions.
PARIS: No, they're not. This decision is the culmination of everything I've ever worked for, everything. I should choose a school based on its merits, not based on its proximity to some guy.
RORY: But Doyle's not just some guy.
PARIS: I know. But I'm only 22. This wasn't supposed to happen yet. I wasn't supposed to meet the guy until I was 30 and clerking for a federal judge or finishing up my residency and when I knew where I'd be when I was ready to settle down.
RORY: Yeah, but you can't plan everything. I mean, you fell in love. That's a good thing.
PARIS: Are you willing to make a decision this big based on Logan?
RORY: Well, actually, we talked about it, and we're gonna factor each other in.
PARIS: What does that mean?
RORY: It just means we're gonna take each other into consideration when we make decisions.
PARIS: Okay. So carry that thought out. Let's say you get The New York Times fellowship and Logan's meetings in San Francisco go incredibly well and he wants to move there. Do you take a job in San Francisco? The chronicle is a perfectly adequate paper. Or do you go to The New York Times?
RORY: The New York Times.
PARIS: Then we're saying the same thing, aren't we?
RORY: No, not at all.
PARIS: You're saying your career is your priority over your relationship.
RORY: They're both priorities.
PARIS: But your career comes first.
RORY: Well, I didn't say it comes first. I -- I'm just not ready to make any sacrifices in that area yet.
PARIS: But you are willing to make sacrifices in your relationship. Hence, your career is more important to you, just like me.
RORY: Well, I wouldn't say "more important." I guess I just thought that if Logan and I have to do long-distance again, we'll make it work.
PARIS: Sure. Maybe. Then again, choosing to be apart might be... choosing to be apart.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR NIGHT
[Luke drives up in his truck and goes to the front door.]
JACKSON: Oh! Hey, Luke.
LUKE: [Surprised] Hey, Jackson.
JACKSON: How you been, man?
LUKE: Uh, not too bad.
JACKSON: You want to come in?
LUKE: Uh, no, that's okay. Is Lorelai here?
JACKSON: Yeah, hang on. [shouting] Lorelai, it's Luke! We thought you were the pizza guy. We're getting pizza tonight, with pepperoni and meatballs and sausage and those extra-crispy, cheesy garlic knots, and we're eating everything on the couch.
LUKE: Well, that sounds...fun.
JACKSON: Yeah, right! [raising a plate of food] Chicken-nugget appetizer?
LUKE: I'm good, I'm good.
LORELAI: Hi.
LUKE: Hi.
JACKSON: Oh, well, good to see you, buddy.
LUKE: Yeah, you too.
LORELAI: What's going on?
LUKE: Okay, here's the deal. I borrowed Kirk's computer, and Zach got me on this craigslist thing, and I found a 1999 Jeep wrangler for sale. The guy actually doesn't live too far from here, so I went to see it. It looks like it's in pretty good shape. So I ran the VIN number. It's got a clean history -- no accidents, no failed emissions. And the guy said he kept it up pretty good, and there's nothing really wrong with it. So I took it for a test drive, and it drove fine. So if you want to keep your old car, for whatever crazy feeling it gives you, okay? Then buy this guy's car, send it to gypsy. She'll take the engine out, put it in the old car, which makes absolutely no sense because you'd basically be paying the same amount of money to fix your old car as you would be paying to get into a new one.
LORELAI: But I'd still have my car.
LUKE: Yeah, gypsy said it'll take about two weeks to finish. Here's the number of the guy, Larry. That's his name. I already negotiated him down 1,500 bucks. Tell him you're Lorelai, Luke's friend. He'll know.
LORELAI: Thanks, I will.
LUKE: It's still a completely ridiculous idea.
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: Al right [Starts walking away.] And, you know, in the meantime, if you're still riding that bike around, come by the diner. I'll put some air in your tires.
LORELAI: I don't need air in my tires.
LUKE: You need air, and you need a light and a bell so people know you're coming.
LORELAI: What if I don't want people to know I'm coming?
LUKE: I'm putting on a bell!
LORELAI: No, you're not!
LUKE: What do you have against bells?
LORELAI: I don't like 'em.
LUKE: Well, you don't have to like them. They're a safety feature.
LORELAI: I want a horn!
LUKE: Fine you want a horn, I'll get you a horn. Are you happy?
[Lorelai smiles and nods]
LUKE: Jeez.
[Luke starts the truck and drives off]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Morning, Rory and Paris having breakfast]
PARIS: So, I don't know where I'll be, but I think I know what I'll be.
RORY: Really?
PARIS: A doctor.
RORY: Oh, Paris, that's great.
PARIS: It's always been my dream, you know? Last night when I was lying in bed watching the ceiling spin…
RORY: I told you that last drink was a mistake.
PARIS: It just became perfectly clear. I've always wanted to be a doctor, for as long as I remember. When I was a kid, I used to cut the heads off my dolls to see what was inside.
RORY: I'm guessing you didn't put that on your applications.
PARIS: I let myself get swayed by the promise of black-card corporate America, but the truth is I want to be a physician -- always have, always will.
RORY: Well, I think it's a very noble profession.
PARIS: Oh, yeah, definitely. It's as close to being god as you can get.
DOYLE: Hey, Paris. Hello, Rory.
RORY: Hey, Doyle.
PARIS: What are you doing here?
DOYLE: I live here.
PARIS: Uh, yeah, but we agreed you'd be the one to move out.
DOYLE: About that -- I changed my mind.
PARIS: It's inappropriate for my best friend to be living alone with my ex-boyfriend.
DOYLE: I don't want to live alone with her. No offense, Rory.
RORY: None taken.
PARIS: We can't all live together. We're broken up.
DOYLE: Actually I changed my mind about that, too.
PARIS: What do you mean? What is he talking about?
RORY: I don't think he wants to break up.
DOYLE: That's right I don't. Oh, and by the way, I think you got into two more med schools -- Washington University and Duke. You know I never saw myself living in St. Louis or North Carolina, but who knows? Maybe I'll end up there.
PARIS: What are you talking about?
DOYLE: I love you, Paris Geller. You are the strongest, most infuriating, most exciting woman I have ever met in my entire life, and there is no way I'm gonna let you go.
PARIS: You don't have a choice.
DOYLE: Sure, I do. Just because you don't want to base your decision on me doesn't mean I can't base my decision on you.
PARIS: That's absurd.
DOYLE: Anywhere you go, I'm going.
PARIS: We're too young to do this!
DOYLE: Maybe you are, but I'm older and a heck of a lot more mature.
PARIS: So... you're saying that if I go to Alaska, you're gonna move there, too?
DOYLE: Well, I've always wanted to go dogsledding.
PARIS: That's ridiculous, with your low threshold for cold.
[Paris and Doyle go into the bedroom as Rory checks the mail, she finds one for her from the James Reston Fellowship]
[Continuing to hear Paris and Doyle from the other room.]
DOYLE: I'll wear warmer clothes.
PARIS: You're not thinking clearly.
DOYLE: I've never been clearer.
PARIS: Keep in mind I'm not going to look for a school with good newspapers nearby.
DOYLE: Keep in mind that the internet is taking off and I can write freelance from anywhere.
PARIS: So that's your plan -- to be a freelance journalist?
DOYLE: No, my plan is to be with you.
PARIS: Why are you doing this?
DOYLE: Because I love you, okay?
PARIS: Well, I love you, too.
DOYLE: That was sweet.
PARIS: Shut up.
[Rory opens the letter, with Paris' lucky letter opener. "We regret to inform you..." She didn't get the fellowship and looks stunned.]

CHILTON CLASSROOM
MRS O'MALLEY: Although getting soviet support for his w*r in the pacific was his top priority, many historians have argued that it was actually Roosevelt's declining health that played the most significant role at Yalta. Had he not been in such failing health, they argue, he would have driven a much harder bargain with Stalin during those fateful negotiations. For Churchill…
CHARLESTON: Excuse me Mrs O'Malley.
MRS O'MALLEY: Excuse me, please.
CHARLESTON: I need you to remove Miss Gilmore from class.
MRS O'MALLEY: Rory Gilmore, there's been a mistake. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
CHARLESTON: And take your things with you. You won't be coming back.
RORY: What?
MRS O'MALLEY: Come on. Quickly.
RORY: But...
[Confused Rory gathers her books, buts on her yellow back pack and leaves, she goes through the classroom door and strait into her house. Still confused she goes inside. Lorelai is coming down the stairs with a suit case.]
RORY: Mom, I had the most awful day.
LORELAI: Hi. I thought I would miss you.
RORY: Where are you going?
LORELAI: Well, I'm going to Hawaii.
RORY: Hawaii?
LORELAI: Yeah. Hawaii.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: 'Cause I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
RORY: I didn't know that.
LORELAI: Yes well.
RORY: Well, when are you coming back?
LORELAI: I don't know. How many ounces can you take on the pLane? Two, Three I forget.
RORY: Mum, I really need to talk.
LORELAI: PLane.
RORY: Well how am I gonna be able to get in touch with you?
LORELAI: You can't. I need a break, kid. Take it easy. Try not to k*ll any plants.
RORY: Well…
[Lorelai leaves. Rory then hears noise in the kitchen, she goes to check it out. Paris, Doyle and tow young kids are having dinner.]
DOYLE: Salman wants to come over for dinner this weekend.
PARIS: Is he bringing that boring wife of his?
DOYLE: Padma is fine.
PARIS: Cookbooks, Doyle. Her husband wrote "The Satanic Verses," and all you'd want to talk about is cookbooks.
DOYLE: I like "Top Chef."
PARIS: Fine, but I'm on call all this weekend, so here's hoping for a heart transplant.
DOYLE: I finally had to fire Broder.
PARIS: Really?
DOYLE: He knew it was coming, but still...
PARIS: Well being Executive Editor of the Washington Post does have its drawbacks. [Stopping Rory] Oh. Hi, Rory.
RORY: Hi.
PARIS: What are you doing here?
RORY: This is my house.
PARIS: Rory, we've been through this. It will always be your house in your heart, but we own it now.
RORY: What are you talking about?
DOYLE: You need money, kid?
RORY: No. At least, I don't think I do.
DOYLE: Here.
RORY: What are you doing?
PARIS: Don't think of it as charity. Think of it as a gift -- a charitable gift.
RORY: [Taking the money] But…
PARIS: You better get going.
DOYLE: Yeah you don't want to be late.
RORY: For what?
PARIS: Uh, work? Oh, and don't forget your poker. That trash isn't gonna pick up itself.
[Doyle opens a large orange plastic bag. Then poker hits a copy of The New York Time, on the floor at Rory's feet. Rory wakes up in a sweat.]
OPENING CREDITS
GILMORE MANSION – LIVING ROOM
[Rory, Lorelai and Emily are listening to Richard]
RICHARD: Not only did he give me a clean bill of health, but Dr. Swinton said he actually thinks I'm in better shape than I was before the heart attack.
LORELAI: Well you do look great, dad. Very Lance Armstrong. What do you think hon.
RORY: You look great, grandpa.
RICHARD: Ah lost 11 pounds.
LORELAI: You can tell. You're super-ripped under that jacket.
RICHARD: Well I've gotten into a good routine with the exercise, and now I can't imagine a day without it.
RORY: Yeah grandma better keep an eye on you over at the club.
EMILY: Rory, I'm so sorry that Logan couldn't join us tonight.
RORY: Oh he was, too, but all his meetings in California have been going so well, he decided to extend his trip.
RICHARD: Good job prospects?
RORY: I think so. He's making a lot of great contacts.
EMILY: Well, next time.
RICHARD: So, when do finals start?
RORY: Uh, tomorrow, actually. Irony from Milton to Byron.
RICHARD: Ha.
EMILY: I hope we're not keeping you from your studies.
RORY: Oh, no. It was so nice to get a break from being in that library all day. Actually It's nice to talk above a whisper.
EMILY: Well, your grandfather and I have a little surprise for you.
LORELAI: Uh-oh.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Did you name another building after her?
EMILY: No.
LORELAI: No I know I know, you bought Yale and named it Rory. From now on, the Ivy League is going to be Harvard, Princeton, and Rory. Has a nice sound, though.
RORY: A nice ring to it.
LORELAI: "Hey, I'll meet you at the Rory/Harvard game."
EMILY: Your grandfather and I have decided to purchase a little Pied-Terre in the city.
RICHARD: Nothing fancy. Just a little two-bedroom on the Upper East Side.
RORY: That's exciting.
EMILY: Now we realize that the Upper East Side is not the most convenient address for an employee of the New York Times, but it's just a 20-minute cab ride to work.
LORELAI: You're giving her an apartment, mom?
EMILY: No. It'll be our apartment but Rory's to live in. Of course we would never drop by unannounced.
RICHARD: Well, that goes without saying.
EMILY: We would just come in on the occasional weekend and maybe stay over some nights when we're going to be in the city late.
LORELAI: Hear that, honey? You and grandma are gonna be roomies.
EMILY: So, what do you think?
RORY: Oh It's a very generous offer.
RICHARD: Oh, we're glad to do it.
RORY: But I don't know if I'm actually gonna be moving to New York after I graduate. I didn't get the internship at the New York Times.
LORELAI: What?
RICHARD: You didn't?
EMILY: That's terrible.
LORELAI: When did you find that out?
RORY: Um, yesterday. It's not a big deal.
EMILY: Well, this is preposterous. Who could be more qualified than you?
RORY: Well the Reston fellowship is very competitive, and they only take a couple of people, so...
RICHARD: This is outrageous. You rose to editor in chief of the Yale Daily News. What else do they want, an exclusive interview with Osama Bin Laden?
[Richard and Emily continue talking amongst themselves]
LORELAI: Why didn't you tell me?
RORY: 'Cause I just found out, and I was so busy studying for finals.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry, sweetie.
RORY: Oh, it's okay. I'm just, as I said, trying to put it behind me.
EMILY: I'm sure it's nepotism. If your name isn't Keller or Sulzberger, you may as well not even apply.
RORY: Oh, grandma, it's okay, I promise. Um actually, I need to get back to Yale soon to keep studying, and I'm kind of hungry -- could we eat?
LORELAI: Yeah, let's get dinner started. Mom? Dad?
EMILY: Well yes, let's eat. I'll have Alexandra serve the salads at once.
STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai is on the phone waling towards Luke's]
LORELAI: Hi, hon, it's me. Just calling to check in and wish you luck this morning. I know it's your first final, and I know you're gonna knock their socks off or their bow ties or whatever it is you knock off professors when you're trying to impress them. Call me when you're done. I love you. Bye.
LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai enters]
BABETTE: "My Funny Valentine" -- it doesn't work. It's April already. What about "Down with Love"?
MISS PATTY: To open? It's too depressing.
BABETTE: It's not depressing. It's ironic.
MISS PATTY: People don't listen to music for irony.
BABETTE: What about weird al?
MISS PATTY: Weird who?
LORELAI: Hi, gals.
MISS PATTY: Lorelai
BABETTE: Hi, hon.
LORELAI: What's with the whispering?
BABETTE: We're saving our voices.
LORELAI: I think that ship has sailed.
MISS PATTY: Oh we're debuting our cabaret act tonight at K.C.'S.
LORELAI: Oh, I thought Saturday was karaoke night at K.C.'S.
BABETTE: It is, so we went over there this morning and signed ourselves up for the first 15 songs.
LORELAI: I'm sure the karaoke regulars will love that.
MISS PATTY: So what do you think, Lorelai, to open the show -- Streisand or Porter?
LORELAI: You cannot go wrong with either one.
MISS PATTY: You're gonna be there?
BABETTE: You got to come, hon. It's gonna be... [louder] fantastic! [quieter] Fantastic.
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
[Lorelai notices Luke is wearing the blue caps she gave him 6 years ago and is confused and a little stunned.]
LUKE: Okay here you go, ladies. More hot water for you, Miss Patty, and for you, Babette, a bowl of shredded wheat.
BABETTE: It's for my throat. Gives it a rougher quality, a husky sound sort of like Debbie Harry meets Ethel Merman!
[Lorelai is still staring at the cap.]
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Nothing.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: I'm just getting some coffee.
LUKE: To go?
LORELAI: Yep.
LUKE: Coming right up.
[They go over to the counter]
LORELAI: Oh, you're preparing for the big boat trip, huh?
LUKE: Yep.
LORELAI: [Sighs as she sits down] Wow. Do you want me to just talk in nautical terms till you go?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Aye, aye, captain.
LUKE: Please don't.
LORELAI: Shiver me timbers.
LUKE: Are you done?
LORELAI: All hands on deck. Now I'm done.
LUKE: Good.
LORELAI: So, where you going?
LUKE: Oh we were thinking of heading up the coast.
LORELAI: Oh, well, up is good.
LUKE: It should be fun.
LORELAI: You're really going on a boat trip, huh? You sure it's a good idea?
LUKE: What's wrong with a boat trip?
LORELAI: Well I mean for starters, you're on a boat.
LUKE: So?
LORELAI: So! Anything could go wrong. You're on a boat in the water in the middle of nowhere. Haven't you seen "Dead Calm," "Open Water," "Das Boot"?
LUKE: Okay, first of all, I did not purchase a u-boat.
LORELAI: "Titanic", surely you've seen "Titanic."
LUKE: April's very excited about this.
LORELAI: Sure she is.
LUKE: Here's your coffee.
LORELAI: Look instead of paying for this, can I just give you some of my sage advice?
LUKE: I'd rather have the dollar.
LORELAI: April says she's very excited?
LUKE: Very excited.
LORELAI: Yeah, she said she's very excited, but if I were you, I would plan a couple nights at a hotel so she can wash her hair and order room service. That's what I would do.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: Okay and if you're heading up the coast, you have to spend as much time as possible on the southern coast of Maine.
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: And you have to go to Barnacle Billy's.
LUKE: Barnacle Billy's?
LORELAI: They have the best lobster you've ever had and you sit on the deck, look at the view -- you never want to leave.
LUKE: I'll check it out.
LORELAI: For all that extra advice, don't I get a doughnut?
[Luke lifts the donut cover]
LORELAI: Thank you very much.
LUKE: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: Bye, Patty. Bye, Babette.
MISS PATTY AND BABETTE: [Singing together] "So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye, goodbye!
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[Rory enters]
RORY: Hey.
PARIS: Hey, Rory. Everybody, this is my roommate, Rory. Rory, this is Elise, Karen, Robin, Tim, and Edwin.
[As a group the welcome Rory with "Howdy" and "Hi"]
PARIS: All fellow Yale seniors and all recently accepted into Harvard Medical school.
RORY: Oh, wow. Congratulations.
THE GROUP: Thank you! Thank you.
PARIS: When word spread around campus about who got in, we decided to get together and celebrate.
RORY: Cool.
PARIS: [Quietly it Rory] A good chance to size up the competition. I know robin, Karen, and Edwin from ORGO, and I'm comfortable that when the time comes, I can crush them. Elise and Tim are new to me, but Elise's hand was shaking a little when she was cutting into the cake, so I've got her pegged for an early exit into podiatry.
RORY: Sounds like quite a party.
PARIS: It really is. Do you want some cake?
RORY: Oh. Definitely not.
PARIS: We tried to get a corpse cake, but we couldn't find a bakery that would make us one, so we had to settle for a naked-guy cake from an erotic bakery in Hartford.
RORY: Yes it's a little early for cake for me.
PARIS: It actually tastes pretty good once you get past the pornographic-dessert issue. Sure I can't interest you in a fibula?
RORY: No, thanks.
PARIS: Here's your mail. You got a letter from the Chicago Sun-Times.
RORY: Oh. Great. [Rory opens the letter right away.] They're not hiring.
PARIS: Bummer. You okay?
RORY: Yeah. I'm fine. It's not a big deal.
PARIS: You want to hang out, have a little champagne? I could use an extra pair of eyes out here.
RORY: I would, but I have a final in one hour, so I'm gonna go shower and close my eyes for a bit.
PARIS: Sure. We'll try to keep it down.
RORY: Okay. Thanks. Nice meeting you, everyone.
GIRL: Bye, Rory.
GUY: Bye!
[Rory goes into her room and reads the letter again, Then gets out her cell phone and makes a call.]
RORY: Hi. Um, I'm calling for Kate Hessel? Rory Gilmore. Okay….Hello, Kate? Um, hi. This is Rory Gilmore. Good. I'm well. How are you? Um, yeah, finals and everything. It's just really crazy right now. But, um, the reason why I was calling is, uh, well, I know that initially I said that I wasn't interested in the job at the providence journal-bulletin, but I was thinking about it, and it's such a great job. It's such a wonderful opportunity that I was wondering if maybe…no. Right. Of course you did. No. It's such a great job. I mean, of course you've already, uh, filled the position. I just thought I would, uh, check…that I would call just in case. Well, thanks. [Rory sighs as she sits n her bed]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Sookie is cooking]
LORELAI: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey! Taste.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Taste.
LORELAI: Oh, it's a meatball.
SOOKIE: So good.
LORELAI: It's 9:00 A.M.
SOOKIE: Look It's amazing. I completely forgot how pregnancy scrambles my taste buds. I swear, it doesn't even taste like a meatball.
LORELAI: Does it taste like a Danish?
SOOKIE: Well okay, then, for lunch. [Chuckles and sighs as she sits on a stool.] So?
LORELAI: So...I went into Luke's diner this morning, and he was wearing the hat I gave him.
SOOKIE: [Gasps] You gave Luke a hat.
LORELAI: No, not recently. Years ago -- for Christmas.
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah, the blue hat.
LORELAI: Yes, the blue hat. And he hasn't worn it since we broke up, I mean not once. I don't blame him. It's totally understandable.
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah, you're right. He wears that black hat now. It gives him a slightly more menacing quality.
LORELAI: But then suddenly today, I walk into the diner, and there it is, atop his head.
SOOKIE: [Gasps] Atop.
LORELAI: Yes, atop his head. What do you think that means?
SOOKIE: It's good.
LORELAI: Good how?
SOOKIE: Well, you know, he's past his pain, you're talking again, you've cleared the air, you're coming into the diner again, and, you know, he's wearing your hat.
LORELAI: Yeah. That's nice, right? I should probably reciprocate.
SOOKIE: Reciprocate?
LORELAI: Yeah, you know he's doing something friendly. I should probably do something friendly back -- wear my own hat, as it were.
SOOKIE: Did he give you a hat?
LORELAI: No, that's the problem.
SOOKIE: Did he give you any friendship thing you can wear?
LORELAI: No, you know, I got rid of all my Luke-related stuff.
SOOKIE: Oh.
LORELAI: We've made such progress lately. You know I don't want to leave his hat gesture unacknowledged.
SOOKIE: Hey, you could always throw on a flannel shirt.
LORELAI: That's a good idea.
SOOKIE: [getting the meat ball] God, are you sure you don't want to try this? What if I scrambled it with some eggs?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Really? [Eats the meat ball] Mmm!
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT
[Lane puts the babies down for their nap, and leaves the bed room, Zach comes home with groceries.]
ZACH: Hey.
LANE: Hi.
ZACH: Are they both down?
LANE: Yes. Three choruses of "Nappy Nappy Time Time" and 20 minutes of Rhythmic Shooshing, and they both conked out. Kwan fought it a little harder than Steve did, but they're both really tired.
ZACH: Good work.
LANE: I don't know what to do first -- sleep or eat. Eat!
ZACH: Hi.
[They kiss]
LANE: Hi!
ZACH: So they didn't have those potato rolls you like, so I got the hamburger rolls which most closely resembled the potato rolls. I checked the ingredients, and potatoes aren't actually listed in there. But are potato rolls made from actual potatoes, or is that just an expression like "finger sandwiches"?
LANE: Um, Zach?
ZACH: Yeah?
LANE: Name-brand diapers and, oh, name-brand chips? Are you crazy?
ZACH: I just thought I'd splurge a little.
LANE: We are on a budget.
ZACH: I know, but I got amazing news in the store. This is the only way I could think to celebrate.
LANE: What news?
ZACH: Okay. You ready? I was in the frozen-foods aisle when I get this call from Graham. You remember graham.
LANE: From vapor rub? Yeah we saw them play last year at the mercury lounge.
ZACH: Yeah well, great news. Their lead guitarist got into this wicked car accident, which isn't the great part, clearly. He's gonna be fine, but the use of his right hand is pretty iffy. Anyway, they need a new guitarist, and they called me.
LANE: Lead guitarist?
ZACH: Lead guitarist.
LANE: For vapor rub?
ZACH: I know.
LANE: Oh my God I want to yell, but I don't want to wake the babies. I'm yelling on the inside.
ZACH: They're going on a 2-month tour this summer, and they want me to join them.
LANE: I can't believe it.
ZACH: Graham talked me through the whole thing, It's the perfect setup. 8 weeks, 25 cities, 40 shows. The whole thing's already practically sold out, and they have this awesome tour bus. And they're cool with you and the boys coming along, 'cause I said, "I can't go if I can't bring the family," and he talked to the band aand they were into it.
LANE: Seriously?
ZACH: Yeah one guy's bringing his girlfriend. The bassist has a puppy. It's totally cool.
LANE: Right now, I am howling at the top of my lungs.
ZACH: Just wait. When we're in Philly and D.C., We're gonna be opening for Tokyo Police Club.
LANE: Foot stomping, so much foot stomping happening here!
ZACH: Yeah the bands are really tight. We're playing at the 930 club, the Black Cat, and the first Unitarian, and we don't even have to bring our own backline.
LANE: Shut up!
ZACH: Graham's always been a big fan of my songwriting, and he said he'd totally give my new stuff a listen.
LANE: So many people are gonna see you play -- I mean, a real tour.
ZACH: And it's a million times better than that Seventh-Day Adventist tour. We get to stay in actual motel rooms, not church basements, and we don't have to run our lyrics past the church elders before every show.
LANE: [Sighs] I am so proud of you, Zach. [They kiss] Now let's pop open the name-brand chips!
ZACH: You want to wake the babies and tell them?
LANE: [Serious look on her face] Do it and die.
LORELAI'S HOUSE – EXTERIOR
[Lorelai drives up in the blue SUV from the Dragonfly Inn, notices Rory's car and goes inside.]
LORELAI: Rory! [Goes to the kitchen] Rory? [Opens the door to Rory's room] Honey?
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Hi.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Whatcha doing?
RORY: Hiding.
LORELAI: From...
RORY: The world.
LORELAI: [Sighs] What's going on? Want to talk about it?
RORY: I t*nk it.
LORELAI: What did you t*nk?
RORY: My final.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sure you didn't t*nk it.
RORY: I'm pretty sure I did.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: 'Cause I didn't even turn in all of it.
LORELAI: Oh, sweetie.
RORY: If I didn't fail it, I didn't do better than a "C"... or a C-minus... or a "D." Oh, what if I got a "d"?
LORELAI: Well, that's okay.
RORY: No, it's not. I mean I knew my stuff you know. The questions were exactly what I anticipated. I could have written about "Paradise Lost" for hours in those blue books, but halfway through the third blue book, I just started thinking, "what is the point? I'm never gonna get a job, anyway."
LORELAI: Not true -- you are gonna get a job.
RORY: I'm not. The New York Times doesn't want me. I got a letter from the Chicago Sun-Times. They're not hiring. I even called the Providence Journal-Bulletin and begged for that job, but they already gave it to someone else, some non-idiot who didn't think they were too good and turn it down.
LORELAI: You're not an idiot.
RORY: I am. Everyone's probably laughing at me. I can probably never show my face in Providence again.
LORELAI: I think you probably can.
RORY: Not without hearing the snickers and the people pointing and laughing at the unemployed, homeless Yale dropout.
LORELAI: Honey, you had a setback, and that is really terrible, but you are so smart and so talented. And there is some paper out there that is gonna hire you as their future superstar. That's just a fact.
RORY: Yeah, right.
LORELAI: Look I think you're having a meltdown, so it's good you came home, because it's sad and disappointing, and everyone needs to have a meltdown once in a while. I speak from experience.
RORY: Ugh.
LORELAI: When is your next final?
RORY: Not for another four days.
LORELAI: Well see? That gives you plenty of time to melt.
RORY: This is all your fault, you know?
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Because you told me I could do anything.
LORELAI: You can.
RORY: Apparently, I can't, and I have two rejection letters and a humiliating phone call to prove it. Do you know what the worst part of this is? I thought I was so in at the Times. I was just saying that I wasn't gonna get it. I was trying to be humble, but I was so not humble. I was so cocky. I was picturing myself working there -- chatting up Bill Keller in the elevator and running down the street for a quick lunch with Maureen Dowd and filing my first story and seeing my first byline. I already had the outfit picked out for my New York Times picture I.D.
LORELAI: The new suit with the red theory shirt.
RORY: Yeah. And now I have to tell everyone that I didn't get it. And I don't want too. Just telling grandma and grandpa made me feel ashamed and humiliated all over again, which is why I didn't tell you. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. It just sucks disappointing everyone.
LORELAI: Honey... you could never disappoint me -- ever.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Ever, ever.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Ever.
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT
[Lane is changing the baby's diapers]
LANE: Have you seen Steve's Paci?
BRIAN: His what?
LANE: His pacifier. It's green. He loses his mind without it. Can you check by the sink? I need to make a list of stuff to take on tour.
BRIAN: Definitely. Zach says they're gonna be playing the Bowery and Roseland.
LANE: Yep.
BRIAN: Insane.
LANE: Insane!
BRIAN: I can't wait to see those shows. And opening for Tokyo Police Club?
LANE: And maybe Grizzly Bear.
BRIAN: Really?
LANE: Yeah I know, he got that call like an hour ago. The whole thing is crazy. Uh-oh.
BRIAN: What?
LANE: Do you smell that?
BRIAN: Well, that's one way to find out.
LANE: Oh, man. I just changed him. Can you put Steve in the stroller? I'll change Kwan.
BRIAN: Got it. You know, their drummer's a bit of a lush.
LANE: Who?
BRIAN: Vapor Rub.
LANE: Oh, right. I know. Zach says he's, like, sober two hours a day.
BRIAN: I'm just saying, one night that guy's not gonna be able to go on. You're gonna be waiting in the wings, and -- boom -- you're their new full-time drummer.
LANE: Wouldn't that be something? [Checking Kwan] Oh, man. You're kidding me.
BRIAN: What?
LANE: False alarm.
BRIAN: Oh.
LANE: What?
BRIAN: Steve is now emitting a very foul odor.
LANE: Oh… Bring him back. [Kwan cries] Oh, no, no. It's okay, Kwan. Just a false alarm. I am sorry. Just getting you dressed again. It's okay. He hates getting naked.
BRIAN: You want his pacifier?
LANE: [Sighs] It's okay. No, that's Steve's. Kwan's is, uh, red.
BRIAN: Got it. Uh-oh.
LANE: [Chuckling] It's okay, Steve. He's coming right back. Maybe you should hold him.
BRIAN: Sure thing.
LANE: Until I'm ready to change him.
BRIAN: Sure thing. I hope the tour bus comes equipped with a nanny.
LANE: Yeah, right. You want to come -- full-time "Manny"?
BRIAN: I wouldn't last a day. I don't know how you do it, Lane.
LANE: Yeah, it's a lot. My mom's actually been a huge help.
BRIAN: Maybe you should take her with you.
LANE: Yeah. Right. [chuckles] I'm sure I'll be fine.
BRIAN: Yeah, definitely. Zach says the bassist's girlfriend is coming along, so, hopefully, she'll be good with kids.
LANE: Yeah, hopefully.



LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory are having lunch]
LORELAI: Alanis Morissette.
RORY: What? No.
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: But she was successful right from the start.
LORELAI: In Canada. She was on "Star Search." She dated Dave Coulier. She struggled a lot before "Jagged Little Pill."
RORY: I don't think that's a good example.
LORELAI: Jackson Pollock.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: He struggled before he succeeded, and I bet if you asked him now, he would tell you he was glad for that.
RORY: Jackson Pollock is dead.
LORELAI: Yes, and from heaven he would tell you he was glad about that, because god rewards those who struggle.
RORY: Okay, mom, I get it. Setbacks make you stronger.
LORELAI: A setback is really just a set-up for future accomplishment. How's your mac and cheese?
RORY: It's not having its usual effect.
LORELAI: I'm sorry.
RORY: It's okay.
LORELAI: You know I'm not just saying this stuff. I really do believe it.
RORY: I know you do mum.
LORELAI: And I think you've had kind of an easy time. I mean most of the things you've gone for you've gotten. This setback might help you have some perspective.
RORY: I guess.
LORELAI: Do you want some French toast? I think Caesar made it today. It has extra brown sugar.
RORY: No, thanks. [short pause in the conversation] Mark Twain.
LORELAI: Hmm?
RORY: Well Mark Twain had to work as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi before he became a successful writer. And if he'd never had that experience, he never would have written "Huckleberry Finn."
LORELAI: Which is one of your favorite books.
RORY: Remember when I made you have my 12th birthday at the mark twain museum in Hartford?
LORELAI: I thought one day I was gonna find you on a raft made out of empty milk cartons, sailing down the Housatonic river.
[Rory's cell phone rings]
RORY: It's Logan.
LORELAI: Go ahead.
RORY: Outside. [Answering it] Hi. I'm okay.
[Luke comes over and sits on a nearby stool]
LUKE: How's she holding up?
LORELAI: Oh, she's okay. Rory's used to getting what Rory wants.
LUKE: Yeah? I know. How you doing?
LORELAI: Me? I'm fine.
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: How's the, uh, trip-planning coming?
LUKE: Great. Great, I actually took your suggestion and booked a couple hotels along the Maine coast -- Kittery, York harbor. You know nothing fancy, just cable TV and a hot shower.
LORELAI: That's great. I think she'll really love that.
LUKE: I even made a reservation at Barnacle Billy's.
LORELAI: Bring me a "to go" box.
LUKE: Will do. You know, I'm getting pretty excited. It's still a couple months away, but the trip is really coming together. You know. It's a lot of time on the water, and we're gonna cover a lot of ground, but it's six weeks, so I think, overall, it probably won't seem like so much.
LORELAI: That sounds great. [Small awkward pause] Hey, Rory and I are gonna go see, Um Patty and Babette's act at K.C.'S tonight. It should be a hoot.
LUKE: You know, not really my thing.
LORELAI: Yeah. No. I'm not saying…
LUKE: No, I know.
[They both laugh]
LORELAI: Just we're going, but, you know.
LUKE: Well, if I have some free time…
LORELAI: No, no, no.
CAESAR: Order up, Luke!
LUKE: I should probably.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: Can I get you anything else?
LORELAI: A doggie bag.
LUKE: I'll take care of it.
LORELAI: Okay.
LUKE'S DINER – EXTERIOR
[Rory is on the phone to Logan.]
RORY: So, when are you coming back?
LOGAN: [In a hotel room in San Francisco] Soon.
RORY: How soon? It's been too long. You have to leave them wanting more.
LOGAN: I'm booked on a red-eye tonight. But we'll see, I have another meeting this afternoon. If these guys want to do dinner, drinks or something I may not have a choice. I'm sorry.
RORY: That's okay. I'm just glad it's going well. Think they're gonna make you an offer?
LOGAN: I don't know it's hard to tell, these guys play things pretty close to the vest.
RORY: Well I'm sure they will. All this time they're keeping you out there -- it can't just be because of your good looks and charm.
LOGAN: I hope not.
RORY: Well, I guess I better let you go.
LOGAN: Okay. I love you.
RORY: I love you, too.
LOGAN: And, hey, don't worry about the Times or the final or any of it. I have a feeling, in the next couple days, you will have moved on and forgotten all about this.
RORY: I don't know.
LOGAN: Things will be looking up, I promise.
RORY: Call me later?
LOGAN: I will.
RORY: Okay. Bye.
[Rory goes back into the diner]
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey. How's the left coast?
RORY: He sounds good, very positive.
LORELAI: Good. You ready to go shopping?
RORY: Yes, there's nothing I love more than shopping after a huge meal.
LORELAI: Lets go.
RORY: Bye, Luke.
LUKE: Take care, Rory.
RORY: Luke changed his hat.
LORELAI: Did he?
[Telephone rings]
LUKE: Luke's.
APRIL: [In her room in New Mexico] Hey, dad.
LUKE: April, hey. What's going on?
APRIL: Not much. How are you?
LUKE: Good. Doing the lunch thing.
APRIL: I tried you on your home phone first. I don't know what I was thinking.
LUKE: Well another 10 minutes, and I'd have been up there. So, what's going on? Just call to say hi?
APRIL: Actually, I've got some news.
LUKE: Good news, I hope.
APRIL: Good and bad, actually.
LUKE: Tell me.
APRIL: Well, in January, I filled out this application for the Metropolitan museum science camp. I wasn't even gonna do it, but Mr. Lazovic, my chemistry teacher -- he wrote me this really nice recommendation. Anyway, I totally forgot about it, 'cause I didn't think I'd ever get in, but I did.
LUKE: Wow, April. Congratulations. That's terrific.
APRIL: Yeah, it is. The only problem is it's six weeks, and it's right during our boat trip.
LUKE: Oh.
APRIL: Yeah and I've been so torn because I really want to take this trip with you, but this camp is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They only take eighth-graders, so this would be the only year I could go, and they would have kids from all over the world there, and they'd have Nobel-winning scientists come and teach classes and stuff.
LUKE: Yeah well, that sounds, uh, pretty incredible.
APRIL: Yeah, but I really want to take this trip with you.
LUKE: Yeah, look, it's too good an opportunity for you to pass up.
APRIL: You think?
LUKE: I do. I mean the boat's not going anywhere. We'll do it next summer.
APRIL: Okay. Are you sure?
LUKE: Absolutely.
APRIL: Okay and It's only six weeks, so I could definitely spend the last two weeks of the summer with you.
LUKE: Well then that's great. We'll take a little trip somewhere.
APRIL: Yeah, definitely.
LUKE: I am so proud of you, kid.
APRIL: Thanks, dad. Um, I'm gonna tell mom that we talked, okay?
LUKE: Okay. I'll call you later.
APRIL: Love you.
LUKE: Love you, too. [Luke hangs up the phone, he sighs as he goes back to work, he looks a little sad, a little lost.]
KC'S BAR
MISS PATTY AND BABETTE: [Singing] When other friendships have been forgot ours will still be hot [Imitates chicken]
[Crowd cheering]
KIRK: Very nice!
BABETTE: You're a terrific crowd!
MISS PATTY: Yeah we have one more song, and then karaoke night will begin.
[Music starts]
BABETTE: I dedicate this next song to my husband, Morey.
[They both start snapping their fingers in time with the music.]
MISS PATTY AND BABETTE: [Singing] Never know how much I love you
never know how much I care
when you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
you give me fever
MISS PATTY: When you kiss me
BABETTE: Fever
MISS PATTY: When you hold me tight
BABETTE: Ooh, fever!
[cut to the girls talking]
RORY: Hey, do you know what would really put me over the top spirit-wise?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: If you sang.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah! On the way home, we'll roll down the windows. I'll belt it out.
RORY: No. Up there.
LORELAI: Oh, no. I'd have to be way more drunk for that.
RORY: Well, we can arrange that. Excuse me. Could we get some shots here?
BABETTE: [singing] You give me fever.
LUKE'S DINER
[Zach is mopping, you can still see the tire mark from the Thunderbird Kirk crashed into the diner.]
ZACH: I've never even been to half the cities we're going to. I mean, Detroit -- how psyched am I?
LUKE: You seem really psyched.
ZACH: I'm totally psyched. Detroit is a major music hub, man, for everybody. It's not just about Eminem and Iggy pop and Motown.
LUKE: Oh no.
ZACH: And we're not just playing anywhere. We're playing The Magic Stick. Everybody's played The Magic Stick -- crooked fingers, The Rose Buds, Bobby Conn, Midlay.
LUKE: Wow.
ZACH: It's gonna be nuts.
LUKE: I'm really happy for you, Zach.
ZACH: And it just works out so perfect time wise. I mean obviously, I'm gonna have to miss a couple weeks' work, but, for the most part, you'll be closed for the summer, anyway, so…
LUKE: Actually, that's not happening now.
ZACH: What?
LUKE: Yeah April and I aren't going away, I mean at least not for most of the summer, so I'm gonna keep the diner open.
ZACH: Oh, man, that totally blows. What happened?
LUKE: Oh she's going to this camp -- this science camp. You know she's super smart -- I mean like, off-the-charts smart -- and she got invited, and it's real prestigious. And she's got to go. She can't not go.
ZACH: Buddy, I'm so sorry.
LUKE: Oh, it's okay.
ZACH: No I know how stoked you were for this trip.
LUKE: No it's all right Zach…
ZACH: All that planning -- you were really into it.
LUKE: It's okay Zach.
ZACH: No! It's not. It sucks.
LUKE: Zach.
ZACH: Okay, I'm sorry. I get it. You're processing.
[Lane comes in]
ZACH: Hey! Hey, babe.
LANE: Hey. [They kiss] Hey, Luke!
LUKE: [As they hug] Lane, hey! It's been a little while.
LANE: Yeah I know I can't believe I'm actually out of the apartment at night and baby-free. I feel like I'm missing a limb -- or two, actually.
LUKE: You look good.
LANE: Thanks. I'm exhausted.
ZACH: But psyched to be out on the town, right?
LANE: So psyched. So are you coming to K.C.'s?
LUKE: Ah I don't think so.
ZACH: Dude, you've got to come. [Quietly to Lane] He just got some totally devastating news.
LUKE: It's actually not that bad.
ZACH: [Quietly to Lane] He's still processing.
LUKE: [Scoffs]
LANE: Luke, you should come.
ZACH: Come on let me buy you a beer.
LUKE: You know you guys, go ahead. Maybe I'll catch up.
ZACH: Okay. That's cool.
LANE: So, maybe we'll see you there.
LUKE: Sure.
[Outside the diner]
LANE: So, what was the news?
ZACH: Oh. April bailed on the boat trip.
LANE: Oh, no.
ZACH: Yeah she's going away to some brainiac science camp for the summer. Who's even heard of science camp? It's a contradiction in terms. It's like a…
LANE: Oxymoron.
ZACH: Oxymoron -- totally. [Short pause] Are you okay there, babe?
LANE: Yeah, I just kind of realized something today.
ZACH: Yeah what's that?
LANE: I realized I can't go on tour. I'd love to -- god, I'd love to -- but it's just not possible -- not with two babies. I mean, you know it's hard enough here at home, where I have a whole support system -- my mom and Brian and Dr. Shaw. I've got my routine, and it's hard, but it's manageable. But it wouldn't be anywhere but here, you know?
ZACH: No, I get it. I do.
LANE: I'm so sorry, Zach.
ZACH: You don't have to be sorry about anything. It makes sense. It's cool. I'll call graham in the morning and tell him we can't go. He'll understand.
LANE: No. Wait. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I can't go. I still want you to go.
ZACH: You do?
LANE: Hell, yeah.
ZACH: No way. Not without you and the boys.
LANE: Zach, this is a really big opportunity.
ZACH: Yeah, but it's two months.
LANE: Exactly. It's not a yearlong world tour. It's two months, it's important, it's a dream come true, and who knows where it could lead?
ZACH: Are you sure?
LANE: I am. We'll talk all the time, and I'll hold the phone up to Steve and Kwan's ears so they can hear your voice. I'll see your shows in New York and Philly and Boston. We'll work this out.
[They kiss]
ZACH: You are the coolest.
LANE: Well, I am married to the lead guitarist of vapor rub.
KC'S BAR
KIRK: [Singing] Do you really want to hurt me?
Do you really want to make me cry?
Precious kisses, words that burn me
lovers never ask you why in my heart...
RORY: How you feeling there, mom?
LORELAI: Ah I must be drunk, 'cause he sounds pretty good.
RORY: Well, get those pipes warmed up, 'cause you're on deck.
LORELAI: I can't follow Kirk. He can really sing!
KIRK: [Singing Off-key] ...People always tell me that's a step, a step too far…
RORY: Come on, mom. If you don't, then you're gonna ruin all this good cheering up you've been doing.
LORELAI: You are relentless!
RORY: I'm thinking something early Madonna.
LANE: Hey!
RORY: Oh, Lane!
LANE: What are you doing here?
RORY: I'm just catching up with my mom.
LORELAI: Hi, Lane. Hey what's up, Zach?
ZACH: Not much, Lorelai. How are you?
LORELAI: Good. A little tipsy.
ZACH: Seems like an appropriate setting for that. [Listening to Kirk] Okay, this is just sinful.
LANE: Be nice.
ZACH: I'm just saying If you're gonna do Boy George, at least commit to the high heels and the makeup.
[They all chuckle]
RORY: Hey, sit. Sit.
LANE: Okay. So, are you done with finals already?
RORY: Ah…
LANE: Wait. Are you actually done with school?
RORY: Um not yet, very soon. I'll be done next week.
LANE: Oh.
LORELAI: Pretzels or peanuts?
RORY: Oh, peanuts, and remember -- if you slip out the back door, I will sink into a deep depression.
LORELAI: Drat!
RORY: So, how are the boys?
LANE: Awesome, exhausting, amazing, infuriating. You name it, I feel it.
ZACH: I'm gonna get a beer. Ginger ale for you, mom?
LANE: Sure.
ZACH: Rory?
RORY: I'm good.
ZACH: Be right back.
LANE: So, really, what's going on with you?
RORY: Oh, I just had a bit of a meltdown, that's all.
LANE: Why? What's going on?
RORY: There's this job that I really wanted, and I didn't get it. I was pretty bummed about it, but my mom talked me down, and everything's fine now. What's going on with you?
LANE: Well, Zach is going on a 2-month tour this summer as the lead guitarist of Vapor Rub, and, yes, I'm serious.
RORY: Vapor Rub? Whatever happened to Hep Alien?
LANE: Well, Hep Alien will live to rock again, but right now, opportunity calls.
RORY: Isn't it gonna be hard for you guys to be apart?
LANE: Definitely, but, you know, it's only two months. And we'll make it work. Life is long.
RORY: When did you get so mature?
LANE: I think the mature gene kicks in once you become a mother.
KIRK: [Singing] Do you really want to make me cry?
MAN: Whoo-hoo! [Cheering]
BABETTE: Wonderful! Wonderful!
MAN: Whoo!
[Cheering as Lorelai takes the stage.]
LORELAI: Honey, it's another embarrassing moment for your diary. [Music starts] Uh-oh. [Puts down her drink, clears throat, chuckles nervously] Happy graduation.
LORELAI: [Singing] If I... should stay [Chuckles nervously] I would only be in your way…
LANE: She's a Whitney fan?
RORY: Oh, I think it's Dolly-inspired.
LORELAI: [Singing] But I know I'll think of you each step of the way,
and I-I-I will always love you…
[Crowd cheers and claps]
MISS PATTY: She's all right!
BABETTE: The kid's stealing our thunder!
LORELAI: I will always love you.
[Luke enters the bar, Lorelai sees him and becomes more serious, now singing to Luke. Luke is smiling]
LORELAI: [Now looking a bit nervous] Bittersweet memories,
that's all I'm taking with me,
so goodbye please don't c-cry,
[Others notice Luke at the bar.]
LORELAI: We both know I'm not what you need,
and I will always love you,
I will always love you.
[Luke is smiling at Lorelai more, he looks happy.]
LORELAI: I hope life treats you kind,
and I hope you have all you dreamed of,
and I wish you joy and happiness,
but above all I wish you love,
and I-I-I will always love you,
I will always love you,
I will always... love you [Chuckles nervously and leaves the stage in a hurry.]
[Cheers, applause and whistling, Rory looks worried as to where Lorelai went. Luke looks happy but a little confused.]
KIRK: Very nice. Check it out.
LORELAI'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
[Rory is cooking as Lorelai comes to the table]
RORY: Morning.
LORELAI: [Groans]
RORY: Coffee?
LORELAI: Yeah. What are you doing up? Why aren't you more hung over?
RORY: Well, I stopped drinking several shots before you did.
LORELAI: Are you going?
RORY: Yeah. I'm gonna stop by Lane's. Then I have to get back to school and start studying for my next final. This time, I intend on turning in all my blue books.
LORELAI: That's too bad. I had a whole second day of pick-me-up plans, including a clown and some pony rides and absolutely no drinking at all.
RORY: Well then you shouldn't have devised such an effective first-day pick-me-up plan.
LORELAI: Well, live and learn.
RORY: I really do feel better, though -- all the wallowing and the eating and the shopping. And I don't know maybe it's because you wished me joy and happiness.
LORELAI: [Chuckles] You liked that, huh?
RORY: It cheered me up.
LORELAI: Well, glad it did.
RORY: I do feel so much better, though. It's like you said -- sometimes you just have to let your feelings out.
LORELAI: [Chuckle with a sigh] Yeah. Sometimes you do. [Shake her head]
LUKE'S DINER
ZACH: Chilaquiles, huh?
LUKE: Chilaquiles.
ZACH: People went nuts for them. Mr. And Mrs. Fiss said they want them every morning now. Who knew? I didn't even think we'd sell one of them.
LUKE: Well it was all Caesar -- his idea, his recipe, his refusal to take no for an answer.
ZACH: Hey, Caesar. Chilaquiles!
CAESAR: Chilaquiles! What'd I tell you, Luke?
LUKE: You told me, Caesar.
CAESAR: I told you.
LUKE: You also told me you told me.
CAESAR: Chilaquiles!
ZACH: Chilaquiles! That dude's a riot. Hey I'm glad you came out last night.
LUKE: Yeah, it was fun.
ZACH: Gypsy does a mean Pat Benatar.
LUKE: That was interesting.
ZACH: How about Lorelai?
LUKE: Huh?
ZACH: What did you think?
LUKE: Oh, uh...
ZACH: I mean the gal can sing, right? Bizarro choice of tune, but she's got some pipes. Nice quality, you know?
LUKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely.
ZACH: So you feeling better? Nah you still bumming about your boat trip, aren't you? Of course you are. Why am I asking?
LUKE: No, no, no, it's okay. I'm actually feeling a little better. And you know hanging around here this summer might not be so bad.
ZACH: That's cool. Maybe we can make karaoke night at K.C.'s kind of a regular thing.
LUKE: Yeah, maybe.
ZACH: Oh, hey, I almost forgot. In the middle of breakfast rush, I found your hat. It was wedged in behind the dishwasher. No worse for the wear, though.
LUKE: Yeah thanks.
ZACH: Yeah I told you it'd turn up.
[Luke looks at the cap, smiles and puts it in his back pocket]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
[Lorelai is watching an old movie "House on Haunted Hill" on the flat screen TV]
ANNABELLE: [Woman on TV] I'm Annabelle Loren. Are you looking for something?
LANCE: [Man on TV] Not exactly.
WANNABELLE: [Woman on TV] Are you the doctor?
LANCE: [Man on TV] No, no I'm Lance Schroeder…
[Knock on door, Paul Anka barks. Lorelai turns the TV off]
LORELAI: Just a minute! [Gets up and goes to the door] Oh, hey.
LOGAN: Hey.
LORELAI: Oh, you just missed Rory. She's on her way back to school.
LOGAN: I know, I'm actually here to see you.
LORELAI: Oh. Okay. Come on in.
LOGAN: Thank you.
LORELAI: Do you want, um, any food or drink? I ordered way too many fries.
LOGAN: No, thanks. I'm all good.
LORELAI: Here, have a seat. Paul Anka! [He jumps of the couch and thy sit down] Um... so, how was your trip?
LOGAN: Oh, it was really great. Actually that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
LORELAI: Oh, god. I know nothing about that world. Apple, IBM, Microsoft…I'm out.
LOGAN: Well, I've been offered a position with an emerging internet company.
LORELAI: Wow, that's great.
LOGAN: Yeah it's pretty similar to what I was doing in New York, but actually they're willing to make me a full partner. I'll be getting in on the ground floor.
LORELAI: That's exciting!
LOGAN: It is. It's gonna be a lot of long hours and an incredible amount of work building the company, but I really feel this venture has a bright future. I mean, these are serious people.
LORELAI: And you're a serious guy. Look, you don't have to convince me. I voiced my concerns, and you told me your plans. We had pie. I'm cool.
LOGAN: Thank you. I appreciate that. That means a lot to me.
LORELAI: Oh. You're welcome.
LOGAN: So, the thing is -- as you can imagine, I'm pretty excited about all this.
LORELAI: Y-yeah.
LOGAN: But it does mean a move to San Francisco -- Palo Alto, actually.
LORELAI: Oh, wow.
LOGAN: Yeah.
LORELAI: That's big. That's funny that Rory didn't mention it.
LOGAN: Well actually, I haven't told her yet.
LORELAI: And you're here 'cause you want me to tell her for you?
LOGAN: No, no. I'm gonna tell her. I just um, I wanted to talk to you first about it.
LORELAI: Okay. That's...thoughtful.
LOGAN: Look... I love Rory. She means the world to me, and I want her to come with me to California.
LORELAI: Oh.
LOGAN: But not just as my girlfriend, which is why I'm here. I'm here to ask your permission -- your permission to ask Rory to marry me.
[Lorelai looks stunned]
LOGAN: Lorelai? Lorelai?

STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai and Sookie are walking through town]
SOOKIE: How did you get roped into bringing the cake to your parents' party?
LORELAI: I made the mistake of telling my mother how much Rory loves the chocolate-raspberry one from Weston's.
SOOKIE: That's my favorite.
LORELAI: I know me too. So now I'm allowed to handle the cake. Drycleaners, help me remember to pick up my dress from the dry cleaners.
SOOKIE: Dry cleaners -- got it.
LORELAI: And heels -- I need to find a pair of heels that will not sink into the grass at Yale. It's all grass at Yale, unless it's cobblestones. Between the grass and the cobblestones, you can't barely walk around there. So in fact don't help me remember heels. Help me remember wedges.
SOOKIE: Dry cleaners and wedges.
LORELAI: Thank you so much for helping me. I have so much on my mind between Rory's graduation and Logan asking me for her hand. Ooh, Champagne and ice -- I need to bring both of those to Yale.
SOOKIE: Dry cleaners, wedges, champagne, and ice.
LORELAI: Although everyone knows it's a rhetorical question…
SOOKIE: Ha?
LORELAI: Logan asking my permission. Have you ever heard of anyone who says no?
SOOKIE: Why did you want to say no?
LORELAI: No, he can ask her anything he wants. I think she's too young to get married but, oh. Plastic champagne flutes -- I can't forget those. I know he asked me out of respect, but I'll tell you what's not respectful is asking for my permission and then making me wait. Every time the phone rings, I think it's gonna be her, telling me that it's happened, but it's not. It's just my mother calling with some boring party detail, like asking me about the ratio of devil to egg.
SOOKIE: Ooh, that's easy. It's one part yolk and two parts mayonnaise. Oh my God you don't care at all, do you?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: No.
[They enter Weston's]
LORELAI: Ooh I have to remember my beaded clutch. Don't let me forget my beaded clutch.
SOOKIE: Got it.
LORELAI: Hey, Sue. I'm here to pick up the cake.
SUE: Oh great. Thanks.
LORELAI: And then, on top of everything, there's this whole Luke thing.
SOOKIE: [Gasps] Oh, thank god. I have been waiting and waiting all morning. I didn't think you were gonna say anything, and then I didn't think I should say anything. So there is a Luke thing?
LORELAI: I don't know Sookie. I can't figure out what happened. I mean clearly something came up when I sang that song.
SOOKIE: Clearly.
LORELAI: But I don't know if it was a new, now feeling or the residue of an old feeling that came up because of the drinks and the lyrics and the hat.
SOOKIE: That was a deadly cocktail.
LORELAI: So that's why I'm going to the diner today -- to see how I feel, sober and without the lyrics of "I will always love you" streaming in front of me.
SOOKIE: Gotcha. But just so you know I think it was a new, now feeling. The way you were singing to him...
LORELAI: Sookie you weren't even there.
SOOKIE: I know but I had enough people describe it to me.
LORELAI: Oh, no!
SOOKIE: No we're just excited for the possibility of you and Luke.
LORELAI: Look I know everyone's heart is in the right place, but I need to figure out what I want.
SOOKIE: Gotcha.
LORELAI: Seriously Sookie I need your help – keeping all these people off my back.
SOOKIE: Understood. But, for the future, the next time you want other people to stay out of your relationship…
LORELAI: Don't serenade your ex in front of the whole town?
SOOKIE: [Gasps] You admit it was a serenade.
LORELAI: Sookie...
LORELAI: Sorry.
SUE: There you go.
LORELAI: Thanks. We can check the cake off our list. What else do I need to remember?
SOOKIE: Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically.
[They leave Weston's]
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically.
LORELAI: Huh?
SOOKIE: It's a mnemonic device. Dress, wedges, champagne, ice, plastic flutes, beaded clutch. "Beaded clutch" is one word.
LORELAI: And panty hose.
SOOKIE: Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically, Polly.
LORELAI: And tissues and my camera.
SOOKIE: "Don't worry, 'cause I prefer footballs, basically," Polly teased Chad.
LORELAI: Why would Polly tease Chad about preferring footballs?
SOOKIE: I don't know. Maybe Polly prefers soccer balls.
LORELAI: That doesn't make any sense.
SOOKIE: Well then stop adding stuff to the list.
[Lorelai giggles]
OPENING CREDITS
LIZ'S SHED
LUKE: Hiya.
LIZ: Wow. It's so great to see you.
LUKE: This place looks totally different.
LIZ: Well T.J. And I fixed it up.
LUKE: You guys did a really great job.
LIZ: Thanks we worked our butts off, but it came out really nice.
LUKE: What's gonna go here?
LIZ: Nothing. T.J. Put those up.
LUKE: Yeah didn't want to tempt fate, huh?
[They laugh]
LIZ: Well, you know, he means well. He also built this coat-rack lamp, and it works.
LUKE: Nice.
LIZ: So, what brings you here?
LUKE: Well you know I want to get Rory a graduation gift, and I just thought earrings might be the right thing you know.
LIZ: Cool. I got a whole lot of them, take a look around. So I heard about Lorelai's karaoke serenade. I wish I had been there.
LUKE: It wasn't a serenade.
LIZ: That's not what I heard. I was at Weston's a couple of days ago, and half the town was talking about it.
LUKE: Well half the town should get a hobby. What do you think about these?
LIZ: Ah, those aren't Rory's taste. They're too trippy. She's not trippy. So, what have you done?
LUKE: What do you mean, what have I done?
LIZ: About the love serenade.
LUKE: It wasn't a serenade, and I haven't done anything. I've worked real hard to try to get that stupid song out of my head.
LIZ: Aren't you gonna respond in some way?
LUKE: Well there's nothing to respond to. She drank a truckload of tequila, and she sang a sappy song.
LIZ: Time. Okay. "I will always love you" is not a sappy song. It's classic Cyndi Lauper.
LUKE: Whitney Houston.
LIZ: It doesn't matter. The point is, she will always love you.
LUKE: I heard the song.
LIZ: She's waiting for you to make a move.
LUKE: Look if it had meant something, she would have come in, you know. What do you think of these?
LIZ: The teardrops -- Rory will love those.
LUKE: Good.
LIZ: Look, all I'm saying is, from everything I've heard and know, Lorelai would like you to respond. I mean Crazy Carrie was there, and she said Lorelai definitely gave you the love look.
LUKE: I wouldn't trust information coming from a woman who wears a cardboard hat. You got a box for those?
LIZ: I certainly do. [Luke looking at something else] You like that?
LUKE: Yeah. Well, it's nice.
LIZ: It is. It would really match Lorelai's eyes. In fact, I was actually thinking of Lorelai when I made that.
LUKE: Well, I wasn't thinking -- it's a nice necklace, is all.
LIZ: [Chuckles] It is. All right. This is on me.
LUKE: Oh, what? No, no. Come on.
LIZ: After everything you've done for me...
LUKE: I'm not gonna not pay.
LIZ: After everything's T.J.'s put you through?
LUKE: That's very nice of you. You know what? Maybe I will get this necklace as a backup for Rory.
LIZ: Right.
LUKE: yeah she has blue eyes, right?
LIZ: Yes, she does.
LUKE: Find a box for that.
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
[They are packing, Doyle is fixing the wall, Paris is on the phone.]
PARIS: Yes, we still have the kitchen table, but the chairs went about a half-hour ago. Yeah let me stop you right there if you want to haggle, go to a flea market, because my other line is ringing. Fine. It's yours. Be here in 20 minutes, or I'll reactivate the listing. [Hangs up the phone] Sold for $15 more than I paid 2 years ago see, the key to haggling is you put your hands around their throat and keep on squeezing.
DOYLE: You've got k*ll, baby.
PARIS: I know. Think of how useful I'll be when we're in India. Oh remind me -- we have to pack Advil. If I get a headache over there, I'm not about to get some Ayurvedic massage.
DOYLE: Sure, just to clarify, you are gonna tame it down a little when we're in India, right? I mean we are tourists.
PARIS: No way. My philosophy is "travel aggressively." Otherwise, you get taken advantage of.
DOYLE: All these textbooks, backpacking? I thought we agreed this is a vacation.
PARIS: I'm not about to drop the ball now that I've gotten into Harvard medical school. This is the time to turn up the intensity.
DOYLE: Paris...
PARIS: It's not gonna be like this forever, I promise, but these next four years are critical. I've got to do well so I can get a great to tier residency. After that, I promise I'll rest. What? Why are you smiling?
DOYLE: Because I love you.
PARIS: Shut up. I love you, too.
[They start kissing, Rory enters]
RORY: Happy last day! Oh. Well, hello, lovebirds.
APRIL: Where were you?
RORY: I went to a theater party with Lucy and Olivia, and I spent the night at their place. Hey, Doyle.
DOYLE: Hey, Rory.
RORY: Ah man, you guys are almost done packing up your stuff?
PARIS: Getting there.
RORY: Can you believe we graduate tomorrow? I can't believe it. I can't wrap my head around it.
PARIS: Oh God. You're not gonna start getting sentimental already, are you?
RORY: That wasn't sentimental. That was incredulous. I'm allowed to be incredulous. I mean can you believe it?
PARIS: Ah yeah, I can, actually. I checked out of this place the second I got into Harvard. God, I never get tired of saying that.
RORY: Well, I can't believe it, and I intend to savor every moment of it.
PARIS: Well, savor while you spackle. I will take you to small-claims court if I don't get back my full deposit. Hey, do you need any boxes? Someone overestimated.
DOYLE: Let it go, Paris.
RORY: Ah no, I'm just taking all my stuff back home, so I'm just gonna throw it all in suitcases. You know what I should take a picture of you packing up the apartment.
PARIS: And that's not sentimental?
RORY: Oh, shush. I'm allowed a little bit of sentiment on my last day of college. Now smile.
PARIS: Are you done?
RORY: No, no. I need a picture of Doyle. He's packing up the toaster. Oh, no toast tomorrow. That's so sad.
PARIS: Rory.
RORY: One more of you with that annoyed face. [Looking annoyed] That's not cute. Make the annoyed face again. Oh, you're so good. You're a natural. I love it.
LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Oh, hey.
MISS PATTY: Hello!
BABETTE: He's upstairs. I'm sure you can go right on up.
LORELAI: Oh no that's okay. I'm just here for coffee.
MISS PATTY: Sure you are.
LORELAI: I am.
BABETTE: Honey, we were there.
MISS PATTY: We heard the song.
BABETTE: It gave me goose bumps.
MISS PATTY: The way you locked eyes with him.
BABETTE: All of that pent-up emotion -- ooh.
LORELAI: No, no, no. It's just karaoke. You know I got swept up in the lyrics and the moment. It didn't mean anything.
LUKE: [Over hearing Lorelai] What can I get for you?
LORELAI: Hi. Um, a coffee.
LUKE: To go, right?
LORELAI: [Unsure and confused] Okay.
BABETTE: Is Rory all excited?
LORELAI: Um yeah. She is.
BABETTE: I can't believe she's done. I still got memories of her as a little girl running around in my head.
LORELAI: Me too. [Too Luke, sounding happy.] Hey, should I have a doughnut or a muffin?
LUKE: [sounding a little annoyed] Whatever you want.
LORELAI: How about a doughnut with a side of muffin?
[Luke nods and leaves, Lorelai is confused still.]
MISS PATTY: So, uh, what time are we supposed to be there, anyway?
LORELAI: Where?
MISS PATTY: Yale.
BABETTE: Oh, yeah, hon, I need directions, 'cause Morey MapQuested it, but the campus is big.
LORELAI: I didn't know you guys all wanted to come.
MISS PATTY: Of course we do.
BABETTE: We wouldn't miss our little girl's graduation.
[Luke drops of the to-go bag for Lorelai, distracting her again.]
LORELAI: Oh well I have to call her and see, make sure there's enough tickets.
BABETTE: Thanks, doll.
MISS PATTY: [Too Babette] How many do you think we need?
BABETTE: Well, let's see. There's Morey and me and you and Lane and Zach and Mrs. Kim -- Lulu and Gypsy, plus one, she said.
LORELAI: That's a lot of people.
BABETTE: Yeah maybe we should charter a van.
LORELAI: [Lorelai's cell phone rings] Ooh, speaking of the graduate.
BABETTE: Say hello to her from us!
LORELAI: I will.
BABETTE: And ask her how long the ceremony is, 'cause I got to plan my snacks.
[Lorelai goes out side and answers the phone.]
LORELAI: Hey!
RORY: Hey. You are not gonna believe it!
LORELAI: Okay. Hold on. [Takes the phone away from her hear and exhales] Believe what?
RORY: Milan Kundera is speaking at our graduation.
LORELAI: [No the news she was expecting] Oh.
RORY: What? You're not a big Kundera fan?
LORELAI: Uh, no. I'm unbearably light on him.
RORY: I see.
LORELAI: Speaking of which, do you think you can get some more graduation tickets? It seems like the whole of stars hollow wants to come.
RORY: Oh, that's sweet, but we only get four, and people have been trying to get extra ones since September.
LORELAI: Oh, no. Anything on the black market?
RORY: No I think we're probably priced out of that.
LORELAI: All right well, you do know the house is gonna get egged.
RORY: I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I'll help you scrub it when I get home.
LORELAI: Wait a minute. Four? There's me, your dad, your grandparents, Logan.
RORY: Logan's sitting with his friends – there're like 20 guys he hasn't seen since last spring.
LORELAI: Mm gotcha.
RORY: So, are you nervous?
LORELAI: About Logan seeing his friends? Not really.
RORY: No. About seeing dad.
LORELAI: Oh, that. No. Ah we talked last night, mostly about our beautiful daughter.
RORY: Oh.
LORELAI: We're both just so proud of you. I think we're gonna be fine.
RORY: Good. What about Luke?
LORELAI: Oh, well, I was just in there, you know. Trying to figure out how I feel.
RORY: And?
LORELAI: And the point is totally moot, because he barely even looked at me.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Yeah I must have completely embarrassed him, in addition to completely embarrassing myself. I've given you the "don't drink to excess" speech, right?
RORY: Well if you haven't, you've certainly taught me by example.
LORELAI: So, anyway, that's that.
RORY: Are you okay?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I mean, I didn't know what I wanted, anyway, so...
RORY: Okay if you need anything...
LORELAI: Yeah. Thanks, hon.
RORY: All right listen I'm gonna go. Logan and I have this romantic afternoon planned.
LORELAI: Oh? Really?
RORY: We're spackling.
LORELAI: Oh. Well, spackle well, or whatever one says to encourage a successful spackle.
RORY: Have a good spackle?
LORELAI: Spackle on.
RORY: Break a spackle?
LORELAI: Knock on spackle if things work out.
RORY: Okay I'll talk to you later.
LORELAI: Tell him I said hi.
RORY: Bye, mom.
LORELAI: Bye. [Sighs after she hangs up.]
TOWN MEETING
TAYLOR: all right, everybody! That's enough! The meeting has come to order. Now before we get down to official business, I would like to unofficially thank all of you for your concerns over my health. I'm doing much better, thank you.
BABETTE: We never heard. What did you do?
LORELAI: Yeah what happened?
MISS PATTY: I heard you slipped in the tub.
TAYLOR: That's right, I did. Let that be a lesson to all of you. Bathroom safety is a serious business. One can never be too careful. Now, onto…
GYPSY: I thought the paramedics found you in your living room.
TAYLOR: Well, yes. The tub was, in fact, a pedi-spa. I have bunions, and I was soaking, but it still was exceedingly slippery. Onto the next order of business. Our esteemed friend and neighbor Kirk would like a permit to do his performance-art piece called "Kirk-in-a-box" in the town square.
KIRK: It isn't a performance-art piece. It is a feat of endurance -- an attempt to stretch the bounds of human possibility.
MISS PATTY: And what exactly is "Kirk-in-a-box"?
KIRK: I will be suspended 20 feet above the street in a clear Lucite box with no food or water.
LORELAI: Like David Blaine.
KIRK: Not at all. My box is smaller.
BABETTE: Why?
KIRK: Because Lucite is very costly.
BABETTE: No. Why are you doing it?
KIRK: To see if I can.
TAYLOR: Let me point out that something like this could draw a crowd.
GYPSY: Hey if Kirk wants to sit in a box, let him sit in a box.
MOREY: Yeah, what do we care?
BABETTE: Yeah you don't have to look. It's a good idea! Let's vote!
TAYLOR: Very well. All those in favor.
[All Aye!]
TAYLOR: All right, all right. But don't complain to me when and if we run into a parking situation…
BABETTE: [Quietly to Lorelai as Taylor continues to talk.] Is there special parking at Yale?
LORELAI: Oh, I meant to tell you. I couldn't get any extra tickets.
BABETTE: What? We don't get to go to Rory's graduation?
LORELAI: I tried.
BABETTE: Isn't there anything you can do?
LORELAI: Well I asked.
TAYLOR: Excuse me, ladies. What is going on over there?
BABETTE: None of us gets to go to Rory's graduation.
[All groan]
LORELAI: I'm sorry. I tried.
TAYLOR: Order! Order! Everyone, quiet down. Clearly, this is an issue of importance to some of you, so let's just add it to tonight's agenda.
LORELAI: No, no, no. Taylor, we don't have to do that.
TAYLOR: Too late. It's already been added. Lorelai, state your case.
LORELAI: I don't have a case.
TAYLOR: Fine. Then just explain how this mishap occurred.
LORELAI: What mishap?
TAYLOR: Clearly, you dropped the ball.
LORELAI: I didn't. They get four per kid. That's how it works. What could I do? I tried.
TAYLOR: Were there no orphans, no children of divorce? Are you telling me that every single student at Yale has at least four people coming to see him or her graduate?
LORELAI: Look, I'm sorry okay, but you'll all get a chance to congratulate her at the graduation party I'm having at my house in a week.
BABETTE: But it's not the same thing. We've all known the kid since she was that high. We want to see that special moment when she gets handed her diploma.
LORELAI: I'm really sorry, guys. I mean maybe I could hand her the diploma again you know, at the party at my house.
BABETTE: You would do that?
LORELAI: Of course.
GYPSY: Well what about the music? You can't have the pomp without the circumstance.
TAYLOR: That's an easy one to solve. The stars hollow high school band will play. It will be a wonderful dress rehearsal for their own ceremony in two weeks.
[All Yeah!]
LORELAI: I don't know if I can fit the whole band inside the house.
TAYLOR: Absolutely not -- your house is not zoned for gatherings larger than 15 people. We'll do it in the town square.
[All exclaim]
LORELAI: Oh, that sounds…
KIRK: Lulu can play Rory. She's a terrific actress.
RORY: What are you, nuts? No way. Rory's gonna play Rory.
BABETTE: Oh, and at the ceremony at Yale, don't forget to take a lot of pictures, 'cause then we can blow them up for the re-enactment!
LORELAI: [Looking worried] Uh, uh, okay.
TAYLOR: I would suggest taking a notebook along. Attention to detail is very important in re-enactments.
LORELAI: [Whimpers]
YALE - RORY'S GRADUATION PARTY
[Several dozen people are celebrating with her, Rory is talking with a few ladies.]
WOMAN 1: We'd love to have you back at the D.A.R.
WOMAN 2: So much, you were a breath of fresh air.
WOMAN 1: We want to start a little outreach program.
WOMAN 2: You wouldn't believe your generation's apathy when it comes to such things as the preservation of this nation's history.
RORY: Oh really yeah that's a shame.
WOMAN 2: We were thinking of renting out a roller rink…
LOGAN: I'm sorry, ladies. Mind if I steal my girlfriend away for a minute? Some rather urgent business.
WOMAN 2: Of course not.
WOMAN 1: We'll talk later.
RORY: Excuse me. [Away from the ladies] Oh you really are my shining, armored knight. You know that.
LOGAN: I saw you dying, and I did want to tell you something rather urgent.
RORY: What's up?
LOGAN: You look beautiful.
RORY: Oh!
[They kiss, Lorelai is watching from a distance]
WOMAN 3::I just can't believe you're old enough to have a daughter in college.
LORELAI: Yeah…
WOMAN 4: Neither can I. What is your skin-care ritual?
LORELAI: Oh, just soap, you know?
WOMAN 3: What kind?
[Lorelai's cell phone rings]
LORELAI: I just get it at the drugstore. Will you excuse me? [Answering the phone] Chris, hi.
EMILY: Where are you going?
LORELAI: I'll be right back.
EMILY: That wasn't the question.
[Lorelai goes outside]
LORELAI: Where are you? Oh. There you are.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey.
CHRISTOPHER: Sorry. I just didn't want to do this in front of everyone.
LORELAI: No, no. I think that's a good thing.
CHRISTOPHER: Hi.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Hi.
CHRISTOPHER: You look good.
LORELAI: You look good.
CHRISTOPHER: So, how is she?
LORELAI: Oh, she's excited. She's good. She's excited.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah? And you?
LORELAI: I'm excited, sad, and nostalgic. Terrified. Logan asked my permission to ask her to marry him.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: Yeah. I know. I mean he hasn't done it yet, you know so maybe he'll back out, but he definitely asked.
CHRISTOPHER: Wow.
LORELAI: Yeah.
CHRISTOPHER: She's so young.
LORELAI: I know.
CHRISTOPHER: So what did you say?
LORELAI: I told him he could ask her.
CHRISTOPHER: Right. Yeah.
LORELAI: What do you think?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm just letting it sink in. You know, you hear about people asking the father. Not that you don't deserve to be asked -- you do. It's just more stuff I've missed.
LORELAI: We're gonna figure out this whole divorced-parenting thing eventually.
CHRISTOPHER: She might be 60.
LORELAI: Well, 60-year-olds are notoriously needy. At least we'll be in sync by then.
CHRISTOPHER: [Sighs]
LORELAI: You want to come see her?
CHRISTOPHER: Let's do it.
LORELAI: Okay.
[They go back inside]
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, kiddo!
RORY: Hi, dad.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey.
[Smooches]
CHRISTOPHER: Hey it's good to see you.
LOGAN: Good to see you, too, sir.
CHRISTOPHER: So, are you getting excited?
RORY: Yeah, I can't believe it's tomorrow.
[Tapping glasses]
RICHARD: Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, first let me thank you for coming to celebrate my granddaughter's graduation. [Emily pinches Richards arm] Ouch! I do beg your pardon. Celebrating our granddaughter's graduation.
[Chuckles from the gathering]
EMILY: I can't let him take all the credit. Have you seen her? Can you blame me?
[More chuckles and laughter]
RICHARD: So, when my wife and I sat down to write our toast, we ran into something of a problem. All of our words sounded too mundane, too insignificant to mark such an auspicious occasion as Rory's graduation from Yale. So instead... maestro...
EMILY: Please excuse us. We're not singers.
[Piano playing]
RICHARD: Never let them see you sweat, dear.
RICHARD: [Singing] You're the top you have graduated.
EMILY: [Singing] You're the top your grandparents are elated.
RICHARD: [Singing] Newspaper editor. Phi Beta Kappa wow!
EMILY: [Singing] You're a revelation. A huge sensation.
RICHARD: [Singing] You should take a bow.
EMILY: [Singing] You are done. No more school for you.
RICHARD: [Singing] There is nothing. Now that you can't do.
EMILY: [Singing] You'll make us proud, we'll sing it loud.
RICHARD: [Singing] It's true!
RICHARD AND EMILY: [Singing] 'Cause now, Rory you're a Bulldog through and through.
[Laughter, applause]
LOGAN: Yeah!
EMILY: Please stop.
RICHARD: Oh, thank you, thank you.
RORY: Wow. Thank you for that.
EMILY: We meant every word of that song.
RICHARD: We certainly did, even the ones we sang off-key. We are so proud of you.
RORY: Oh thank you so much. You know that none of this would be possible without your help so. You should all know that there's no way I could be a Bulldog through and through if it weren't for these two, so thank you so much, grandma and grandpa.
RICHARD: Congratulations, Rory. [They clink glasses] To you.
LORELAI: Cheers.
ALL: Cheers.
CHRISTOPHER: [Cell phone rings, leaving a message] Oh, it's the babysitter, checking to see if Gigi Can watch an hour of television. I don't think she's ready for "The Pussycat Dolls." I'll be right back.
LOGAN: Actually, would you mind waiting?
CHRISTOPHER: Sure.
LOGAN: trust me you'll want to stick around for this.
CHRISTOPHER: [To Lorelai] Okay. Is he gonna...
LORELAI: [To Chris] Not here. Not now.
LOGAN: If I could, I'd also like to say a few words about my girlfriend of the past three years. You amaze me, Rory Gilmore, every day -- everything that you do, everything that you are.
RORY: [giggles]
LOGAN: This past year, I realized that I don't know a lot more than I thought I knew, if that makes sense. I'm a little bit nervous. I didn't think I would be. What I'm trying to say is that... I don't know a lot. But I know that I love you... and I want to be with you... forever.
[All Sighs]
LOGAN: Rory Gilmore... ...will you marry me?
RORY: Um... um, wow. Um, wow. I -- wow.
LOGAN: Is there a "yes" in between those "wows"?
RORY: Um, I'm just… I'm so...surprised. I-I just -- um, would -- um... w-will you come talk to me outside?
LOGAN: Sure.
RORY: Yeah. Okay.
[Guests murmuring]
EMILY: [To the pianist] Play something -- now.
[Piano plays mid-tempo music, Emily watches them go outside, Richard and Lorelai look worried. Outside Logan and Rory talk.]
RORY: Sorry. I-I didn't want to talk in front of everybody.
LOGAN: No. I completely understand.
RORY: [Seeing a white carriage and 2 white horses] Is that…
LOGAN: For us? Yeah.
RORY: [Shocked by it all]
LOGAN: I'm sorry I know you said you were over big gestures, but that's what wedding proposals are. And night with your parents here and your grandparents, I just thought…
RORY: No, it's not the size of the gesture. It's the gesture itself.
LOGAN: Rory, I got the job out in silicon valley.
RORY: What? You did? When?!
LOGAN: They offered me the position about 45 minutes after the meeting, but I wanted to save the news until after I proposed.
RORY: Wow. You've been thinking about this for a while.
LOGAN: Yeah. Back when everything was up in the air business-wise, I realized as long as I had you, I'd be okay. You would love Palo Alto, Rory. We could go hiking in the Dish on weekends, biking at the Baylands.
RORY: Wow. California sounds really athletic.
LOGAN: Or coffee drinking on university avenue.
RORY: That's much easier to imagine.
LOGAN: I went exploring a little, and there is this house that we could rent. It has a backyard with an avocado tree.
RORY: I do like guacamole.
LOGAN: And it's only 35 miles south of San Francisco -- just a straight sh*t up the 101.
RORY: Wow you've done a lot of research.
LOGAN: Yeah you could work at the Chronicle, The San Francisco Bay Guardian.
RORY: Wow. Oh, it sounds amazing. Logan, it sounds wonderful. I just -- I don't know. I mean, you've had time to think about this and research. It's so sweet and wonderful. I just -- I'm hearing about it for the first time.
LOGAN: So you're saying in the past three years, you never thought about marrying me?
RORY: No, of course I have.
LOGAN: And?
RORY: And it's always a really wonderful thought, but it was always hypothetical and…
LOGAN: I know. For me, too. But then it hit me -- why wait? Remember when we were in the life and death brigade and we stood on top of that tower, and we held hands and we jumped? Let's do that again, Rory. Let's jump.
[Rory smiles at Logan, meanwhile back inside.]



EMILY: Well I don't what to do, should I continue to stagger the hors d'oeuvres or just tell the kitchen to send everything out?
LORELAI: I don't know.
EMILY: What didn't she just say "yes"?
LORELAI: I think she's not sure she wants to marry him, mom.
EMILY: That's ridiculous. He's a Huntzberger. An offer like this doesn't come around every day.
LORELAI: It's a marriage proposal, not a sale on linens.
RICHARD: Clearly, Rory was caught off guard. All of us were. [Lorelai cell phone rings] I'm sure she just needs a moment to get her bearings.
LORELAI: Hi, hon.
EMILY: Is that Rory? Did she say yes?
LORELAI: [To Chris] Hey, it's Rory. Do you want to come?
CHRISTOPHER: No. You go.
LORELAI: Okay. [Too Rory] Hi.
HORSE DRAWN CARRIAGE
[The girls are riding along]
RORY: I just couldn't answer him. You know I just kept saying, "I don't know. I'll have to think about it." It was awful. He was obviously disappointed and upset. You know he made all these plans about the house we would live in and the avocado tree in our backyard.
LORELAI: Well, you do like guacamole.
RORY: I just had to explain to him how out of the blue this is. I mean this is seriously out of the blue -- out of the deepest, darkest, naviest blue. And why are you so calm, by the way?
LORELAI: Oh, well, he asked my permission a couple days ago.
RORY: What? You knew?
LORELAI: I was dying to tell you.
RORY: Oh man you are a good secret keeper.
LORELAI: Not really. I told Sookie. I told your dad. Paul Anka and I discussed it at length.
RORY: So what do you think I should do?
LORELAI: Oh, honey, I think it's your decision.
RORY: I know, but tell me what you think I should do.
LORELAI: Well, I think you should take a few days, you know, let the shock wear off.
RORY: You're really not gonna give me your opinion?
LORELAI: Only you know what you want.
RORY: Yeah. [Sighs] I love him. I do. I mean, things have been really amazing lately. But, on the other hand, we are so young. I'm only 22. On the other hand, what does age matter when you're in love? On the other hand, what is the rush?
LORELAI: Well, you're like a circus freak with all the hands.
RORY: Won't you just tell me what to do?
LORELAI: Honey, I'm sorry.
RORY: Oh! Okay. You don't have to say anything. Just blink one eye if you think I should do it.
LORELAI: No.
RORY: 'Cause you don't?
LORELAI: 'Cause I won't.
RORY: This is like the bird-versus-turtle Halloween costume all over again.
LORELAI: Well I didn't crack then, and I'm not gonna crack now. I just think you need to figure it out. And remember -- that flying turtle bird was the most original costume in the third grade.
RORY: Yeah. [Sighs] But this time I have to choose -- turtle or bird?
LORELAI: Well, you're not in third grade anymore.
RORY: Yeah, I guess not.
LORELAI: Hey, how many hours do we have the carriage for?
RORY: Um, a couple more, I'm guessing.
LORELAI: Want to drive through the center of town and do the queen wave?
RORY: Yes.
STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai is walking the darken street towards Luke's, she sees Kirk in the Lucite box. Luke comes out of the diner with some trash.]
LUKE: How's it going?
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: What are you doing out here so late?
LORELAI: I needed to take a walk to clear my head, and I wanted to see if Kirk was still in the box.
LUKE: Yeah apparently he is you know, I wouldn't know. I've decided to ignore him. Gawking only encourages his asinine behavior.
LORELAI: What about you? You're usually long gone by now.
LUKE: The softball team's celebrating their first win. I couldn't get them out the door. Clearing your head about what?
LORELAI: [Sighs] Logan proposed to Rory.
LUKE: No way. Wow. Wow. I guess you would need a walk for that. What did she say?
LORELAI: Well, she said she needed time to mull it over.
LUKE: Good answer.
LORELAI: I thought so.
LUKE: Yeah. So, did she ask for your advice?
LORELAI: She did. Yeah.
LUKE: And?
LORELAI: I told her it was her decision. My mother's picking out china patterns.
LUKE: Oh, I bet she's all over that. So, you're leaning toward "no"?
LORELAI: Oh, uh, no. I'm not really leaning. I'm kind of upright.
LUKE: Oh well I just, I could understand if you were leaning away from "yes."
LORELAI: Why?
LUKE: Well I mean she's really young and it's the most important decision of your life -- you know, her life.
LORELAI: Well, they love each other. He's been great. Maybe they got it together young. Some people do.
LUKE: Right and others need time.
LORELAI: Sure. Or they're never ready.
LUKE: I wouldn't say "never." Just they want to be a little more careful. They're a little slower, you know, just to make sure it's right.
LORELAI: Well you can't always be 100% sure it's right. Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith.
LUKE: You got to know what you're leaping into.
LORELAI: After all this time, how could you not know?
LUKE: How could who not know?
LORELAI: Rory.
LUKE: Right.
LORELAI: Right.
LUKE: Rory.
LORELAI: Well, that was my walk, and, uh, I'm gonna head home.
LUKE: Good enough. Oh, I almost forgot something. Hang on.
[Luke goes into the diner.]
LORELAI: Are you allowed to talk in there?
KIRK: Rules are a little gray on that!
[Inside Luke's, behind the counter he gets the earrings for Rory, the other box for Lorelai is also in the draw, he hesitates and leaves it. And goes outside.]
LUKE: I got this for Rory.
[Lorelai is surprised]
LORELAI: Oh.
LUKE: Yeah. I just thought it would be better if she got it on the day of her actual graduation.
LORELAI: Oh, that's -- that's -- that's nice.
LUKE: Yeah, so...
LORELAI: Thoughtful. So, good night.
LUKE: Good night.
LORELAI: Good night, Kirk.
KIRK: Good night.
[Kirk lies down]
PARIS AND DOYLES APARTMENT
[Rory is finishing the spackle work. Stops to look for food, finds some cereal and gets a bowl and spoon from a box. Checks the fridge for mike, but it has "For! Paris! Only!" on it, so puts it back and has it dry. She tries on the ring and smiles.]
YALE - GROUNDS
[Emily. Richard and Lorelai are walking.]
RICHARD: I'm just saying he's a superb writer.
EMILY: I'm just saying that a superb writer does not a superb speaker make. I could barely stay awake.
RICHARD: I told you to start with coffee. It's a two-ceremony day.
LORELAI: Maybe it's just a cultural thing. Maybe Milan Kundera is the Robin Williams of the Czech republic.
EMILY: With that voice? So soporific it was as if he were trying to perform a mass hypnosis.
LORELAI: We should hurry up if we want to get good seats to watch Rory get her diploma.
EMILY: My point is, with all the potential speakers out there, why choose someone so dull?
LORELAI: You know for a while, Rory said they were considering Henry Winkler. That would have been neat.
EMILY: Who?
RICHARD: You mean Henry Kissinger?
LORELAI: Not unless he played the Fonz.
EMILY: I'm assuming that Logan will join us for the actual commencement at Branford.
LORELAI: Nope.
EMILY: No?
LORELAI: He's sitting with his friends. Plus, I think it would be awkward, you know?
EMILY: I don't know. No one knows. Only Rory.
LORELAI: Well, mom...
EMILY: Well I just can't believe you don't have more information.
LORELAI: She said she's thinking about it so she's thinking.
EMILY: What is she thinking?
LORELAI: I don't know.
EMILY: Why not?
RICHARD: Actually, Kissinger would be duller than Kundera with that foghorn voice and that accent. Of the two, I'd vote for the Fonz.
EMILY: Do you even know who the Fonz is?
LORELAI: Oh, wait, wait. Oh, sh**t.
RICHARD: What's wrong?
LORELAI: I promised Patty and Babette that I would get lots of extra programs for the re-enactment.
EMILY: Oh here. You can have mine.
LORELAI: [Groans]
EMILY: What? It was hot. I needed a fan.
RICHARD: Sweetheart, I'm sure I can use some of my many contacts to procure as many programs as you need.
LORELAI: Really? Could you? That would be great.
EMILY: Can I have my program back, then? As my friend Sylvia Rosenblat is saying, I'm "Shavitzing."
LORELAI: Shvitzing, mom. Shvitzing. Never mind.
YALE - GROUNDS
[Rory, Paris, Lucy and Olivia (who is opening a bottle of champagne.)]
OLIVIA: So, seriously, 90% of the class was at this party…
LUCY: More!
OLIVIA: And everyone's watching. He starts to -- swear to god -- do the robot.
RORY: Professor Watley?
LUCY: Uh-huh.
PARIS: Wait isn't he like 150?
LUCY: I know, right. At first, we thought he was having a seizure, which you know would have been easier to take.
OLIVIA: That was so funny, an awesome party, by the way. I thought you were gonna come after your grandparents' little cocktail bash.
LUCY: Yeah, Gilmore, you're so lame for blowing it off.
PARIS: Yeah at least I had an excuse. My boyfriend and I went to "Star of b*mb" as a little warm-up for our trip to India. It turns out Doyle's stomach and Vindaloo are not bunk buddies. It's gonna be a long trip.
RORY: Well I would have gone to that party if somebody hadn't insisted that I finish spackling all the holes in our apartment, upon pain of death.
PARIS: Hey, each unspackled hole is deposit money that our hygienically challenged, sleazebag of a landlord will use to supply his freaking p*rn habit.
RORY: College has mellowed Paris.
LUCY: How was your grandparents' cocktail party? Were there great huzzahs in your honor?
RORY: Oh it was fine. People walked around, had grown-up drinks, and my grandparents sang me a song. I turned a deep shade of red. It was fine.
OLIVIA: Uh-oh it looks like you guys are lining up.
LUCY: We better get over to Saybrook. [Holding the champagne bottle high] To our future!
TOGETHER: Huzzah!
LUCY: I wonder if I'll actually get my diploma in my envelope.
RORY: Why? Do you have some overdue library books?
OLIVIA: And she has no idea where they are.
LUCY: Please forward my mail to Argentina. I'll be hiding out until the heat blows over. I love you guys!
OLIVIA: Bye!
RORY: Bye!
YALE
[The ceremony is about to get under way. Lorelai, Emily and Richard are finding their seats.]
EMILY: Did she try on the ring?
LORELAI: I have no idea.
EMILY: I can't believe you have no idea what she's going to do. I mean aren't you two "bosom buddies" Isn't the sharing of intimate information your thing?
LORELAI: Mom our thing right now is letting Rory make her own decisions.
EMILY: What did you tell her to do?
LORELAI: Mom I didn't tell her to do anything. I'm letting her make her own decision.
EMILY: But you must have at least…
RICHARD: Emily can we focus on the ceremony?
LORELAI: So, are these seats okay? Can you both see the stage?
RICHARD: Perfectly.
EMILY: Well, I'm sure someone will take a photo of Rory receiving her diploma close-up.
LORELAI: Mom, if you don't like these seats, we can go look for others.
EMILY: No. Then we'll lose these.
LORELAI: Well we can have dad wait here while I try to find better seats…
RICHARD: Lorelai, these seats are fine.
LORELAI: Hey!
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
EMILY: You're not late. The ceremony is starting late, of course, after Lorelai drove us like cattle to get here.
LORELAI: [To Chris] You be the deciding vote. Are these seats okay, or do you think we should look for better ones?
CHRISTOPHER: These seem great.
LORELAI: [Giggles] Really? Because that lady has long hair, and if a breeze blows up, it might…
RICHARD: Lorelai, Lorelai, the seats are perfect.
LORELAI: All righty.
CHRISTOPHER: Any answer from Rory?
LORELAI: Not yet.
EMILY: Apparently Lorelai has decided to invoke the "don't ask, don't tell" rule.
LORELAI: Oh mom.
RICHARD: Bill Clinton -- that's a speaker I would have enjoyed. I can't stand his politics, but he has a commanding presence and a nice voice. I wonder if he records books on tape.
[Lorelai and Chris look at each other, amused at Richard]
YALE
[Paris and Rory line up]
PARIS: So have you thought about what you're going to say?
RORY: What?
PARIS: When he hands you the diploma. I can't decide between "thank you" and "thank you so much."
RORY: Oh.
PARIS: It's a significant moment, and I want to do it right. If I say just plain "thank you," it sounds kind of casual, like he's handing me a slice of pizza. But "thank you so much" sounds weird, like I'm acknowledging applause after singing a love ballad.
RORY: I think I'm just gonna do a polite smile and a "thank you." Okay. This is it.
PARIS: Yeah. We've been drafting off each other since high school, and now it's each woman for herself. Who knows when we'll see each other again, right?
RORY: Paris I haven't been able to shake you off all these years. We're gonna be friends for a very long time.
PARIS: You're gonna do such great things with your life, Rory.
[Paris surprises Rory with a hug.]
RORY: Oh! Wow. Okay.
WOMAN: Okay, G's, you're on the move!
[Rory see Logan in the distance, with his friends, he waves to her]
PARIS: Unto the breach.
YALE - CEREMONY
[The ceremony is underway]
MAN: Phoebe Elizabeth Gabner.
LORELAI: You ready to be parents of a Yale graduate?
CHRISTOPHER: I already got the bumper sticker picked out.
EMILY: Just so you know, I read in the New York Times that people are getting married younger and younger these days.
LORELAI: Well the good news is, if it was in the New York Times, Rory saw it and filed it away. What's wrong?
EMILY: This chair is faulty. Every time I lean from one side to the other, I almost slide off.
LORELAI: Do you want to switch seats?
RICHARD: Now Lorelai, you don't need to switch. Emily, your chair's fine. Just don't lean.
EMILY: I have to lean. This woman keeps rocking back and forth. It's like sitting behind Ray Charles.
MAN: Paris Eustace Geller.
LORELAI: Oh, Paris!
[They clap]
EMILY: I'm just saying you have pull. Use it. That's what parenting is.
LORELAI: Don't know if her family is here, I'm gonna take a picture for Rory.
EMILY: She looks up to you, and when a child looks up to you and has a difficult decision to make, you tell her what to do.
LORELAI: That's not how I do it.
EMILY: So you're just content…
RICHARD: Emily, please. Rory is next.
MAN: Roberta Gelson.
LORELAI: [To Chris] Honey, tell me what time it is. I told everyone I'd notice the exact time so that when we do the re-enactment they would have the…
RICHARD: Lorelai, I will note the time. I will take the photo. You just sit there and enjoy your daughter's graduation from Yale. This is as much your moment as Rory's. Enjoy it.
MAN: Lorelai Leigh Gilmore.
[Rory receves her diploma.]
LORELAI: Yay, Rory! [Lorelai yells out as she stands and claps over come with emotion, Rory looks over to see Lorelai and Chris standing and clapping.]
YALE
[Later, they are taking photo's, Chris is behind the camera.]
RICHARD: All right, everyone. Say "Fromage."
LORELAI: Dad.
EMILY: Must you always do that?
LORELAI: Entertain them with that in the Great w*r?
CHRISTOPHER: [Takes the photo] Got it.
RICHARD: Excellent.
EMILY: All right what other combinations haven't we done?
RORY: Um, duh. Me, mom, and dad.
EMILY: "Duh"? That's our Yale graduate.
LORELAI: She meant "Doy".
RICHARD: All right. Everybody, everybody say...
AS A GROUP: Don't!
RICHARD: ...Whatever you like. [Takes the photo] Got it.
EMILY: Good, make sure you save it. You erased the last one.
RICHARD: I don't trust these things.
RORY: [Seeing Logan] I'll be right back.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh, Richard, Emily, can I get one with you guys?
[Meanwhile Rory approaches Logan, who is talking to someone.]
LOGAN: Thank you. Good to see you. [Too Rory] Hey. Congratulations.
RORY: Thanks.
LOGAN: Yeah you did great -- no tripping, no dropping the diploma.
RORY: No, nothing like that.
LOGAN: I remember when I graduated. I was a little tipsy -- that's a big surprise, huh? -- And I did trip, and I reached out and grabbed the robe of Marcia Hadley, who was so not the person to grab.
RORY: Logan… I'm sorry… I can't. I love you. You know how much I love you. I love the idea of being married to you... but... there are just a lot of things right now in my life that are undecided. And that used to scare me, but now I-I kind of like the idea that...it's just all kind of...wide open. And if I married you, it just wouldn't be.
LOGAN: So, what? I go to San Francisco, you stay on the east, and we see each other occasionally?
RORY: Well, we can try long distance. We've done it before.
LOGAN: You really think that's gonna work?
RORY: I think it would be hard, but...
LOGAN: I don't want to do that, Rory. I don't want to go backwards. If we can't take the next step...
RORY: What?
LOGAN: I mean...
RORY: Does it have to be all or nothing?
LOGAN: Yeah, it does.
RORY: But we could at least try.
LOGAN: What's the point?
RORY: So...
LOGAN: So... [Rory hand the engagement ring back, Logan reluctantly takes it.] goodbye, Rory.
[Logan walks away, Rory looks sad but not crying.]
PARIS AND DOYLE'S APARTMENT
RORY: Okay. Just one more trip.
LORELAI: No! I can't. This is why we don't exercise. It's too exhausting.
RORY: Well it wouldn't be so exhausting if we exercised.
LORELAI: Oh, darn your college-graduate logic. How you doing, honey?
RORY: Uh, okay.
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: Well, I'm not okay. I feel awful. I feel sick. I miss him already.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: And it just sucks, you know, because I graduated today. This was supposed to be a happy day in my life, and now when I look back on it, I'm just gonna think about this horrible thing that happened.
LORELAI: I'm sorry. I think you made the right decision.
RORY: You do?
LORELAI: I do. Someday you'll meet someone, and you'll just know it's right. You won't want to hesitate. You'll just know.
RORY: I hope so.
LORELAI: I really do believe it.
RORY: So I guess no avocado trees.
LORELAI: Well, no avocado tree.
RORY: You know, I think I'll get my own avocado tree.
LORELAI: See? You could get your own cherry tree, get your own peanut tree, just have peanut butter all day long.
RORY: Peanuts don't grown on trees. They grow under the ground.
LORELAI: Whatever. My point is you can have anything you want.
RORY: Oh, yes. It's wide open.
[Rory takes the last box out, looks at the apartment one last time. Rory sighs as she turns out the light and closes the door.]
LORELAI: What do you mean, peanuts don't grow on trees?
RORY: Mom, trust me. I'm a college graduate.

DRAGONFLY INN – EXTERIOR
[The Jeeps pulls up with Lorelai driving]
LORELAI: I'm telling you, it's her.
RORY: Trust me, it's not.
LORELAI: It is.
RORY: Why would Christiane Amanpour be hanging out at the Dragonfly?
LORELAI: I don't know.
RORY: She wouldn't.
LORELAI: She is.
RORY: You went up to her and said hi, and she said, "Hi, I'm Christiane Amanpour, nice to meet you"?
[The Jeep stops and the girls get out]
LORELAI: No, I didn't go up to her at all. I looked at here and saw that it was her, and I went to get you.
RORY: So I could look at a fake Christiane Amanpour?
LORELAI: She's real.
RORY: Yeah. Remember the time when you thought saw Sandra Day O'Connor?
LORELAI: Yeah well this is different and I haven't had any cough syrup.
RORY: I guarantee you it's not her.
[They enter the Inn]
LORELAI: You doubt my ability to recognize a glamorous, international w*r correspondent?
RORY: I guarantee you it's not her. Oh, my god, that's Christiane Amanpour!
LORELAI: That's what I told you.
RORY: I can't meet Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.
LORELAI: I tried to get you to change, you wouldn't change.
RORY: Well how long has she been here?
LORELAI: I don't know I just saw her eating breakfast and I went home and got you. Hey, Michel, Michel, how long has Christiane Amanpour been here?
MICHEL: Ah she checked in late last night, room 7.
LORELAI: She's staying here?
RORY: [gasps]
LORELAI: You didn't tell me?
MICHEL: I wanted to avoid yet another embarrassing incident.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
MICHEL: You always embarrass yourself when celebrities stay at the inn.
LORELAI: I do not.
MICHEL: Jane Pauley, Harry Belafonte, Marisa Tomei.
RORY: He's right, you know?
LORELAI: No, no, Marisa Tomei's mother's best friend is my hairdresser's cousin's roommate. That's just freaky.
MICHEL: I'm just saying you make them uncomfortable.
LORELAI: I run an inn. These are my guests. What am I supposed to do -- ignore them?
MICHEL: I think that might be best.
LORELAI: I'm gonna go over and say hi and see if she'll meet you.
RORY: What? Okay. Wait. Don't be funny.
[Rory goes to "hide" at reception while Lorelai goes to Christiane Amanpour]
LORELAI: Excuse me, Ms. Amanpour?
Christiane Amanpour: Yes.
LORELAI: Hello, I'm Lorelai Gilmore. I run the inn.
Christiane Amanpour: Very nice to meet you. It's a lovely inn.
LORELAI: Thank you so much. Um I'm sorry to bother you, but my daughter is a huge fan of yours, she always has been.
Christiane Amanpour: That's very nice to hear. Thank you.
LORELAI: Yeah she just graduated from Yale, actually, where she was the editor of the Yale Daily News.
Christiane Amanpour: That's great.
LORELAI: Anyway, Um she'd love to meet you, if that's okay.
Christiane Amanpour: I'd love to. Is she here?
LORELAI: Yes, she is. Rory, come here.
[Rory goes out of hiding]
LORELAI: Come on. Okay, here she is. This is Rory Gilmore. Rory, meet Christiane Amanpour.
Christiane Amanpour: Hi, Rory. How are you? Nice to meet you.
RORY: Nice to meet you, too. I'm sorry to meet you in my pajamas. I don't usually walk around town like this.
Christiane Amanpour: That's okay.
RORY: I just think you are so inspiring. Your reporting is so bold and moving and fascinating and I know you've won nine Emmys, but I just don't think that's enough -- not that you care about that kind of thing, but I just want to say thank you.
Christiane Amanpour: Thank you. That's really nice of you. And your mother says that you've graduated Yale, editor of the Yale Daily News -- that's not bad.
RORY: Oh, thank you. I want to pursue a career in journalism.
Christiane Amanpour: That's good, is it print you want? Television? CNN, maybe?
RORY: Oh, I'd love to work for a major daily.
Christiane Amanpour: Do you know which one?
RORY: Any one that will take me.
Christiane Amanpour: That's the spirit. I mean you just get in there, do what you can, show them what you've got, and the rest will take care of itself.
RORY: That's my plan.
Christiane Amanpour: Listen, I don't often do this, but I'm going to give you my card, and if you want to send me some stuff, I'll have a look at it and you know stay in touch.
RORY: Seriously?
Christiane Amanpour: Yes, yeah.
RORY: Thank you.
[Car horn honks]
Christiane Amanpour: That's my cab out there, so I'm gonna go now. It was really nice to meet you. [Shaking Lorelai's hand.]
LORELAI: Nice to meet you.
Christiane Amanpour: Nice to meet you. [Shaking Rory's hand.]
RORY: Nice to meet you.
Christiane Amanpour: Good luck. Take care.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you so much.
LORELAI: [Gasps]
RORY: I can't believe I just met Christiane Amanpour in my pajamas.
LORELAI: Well, I'm sure you made an impression.
OPENING CREDITS
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S ROOM
[Lorelai is on the bed with a Laptop]
LORELAI: All right after "Great Adventure" the next Roller coaster would be here at Lake Compounds, home of the "Boulder Dash".
RORY: Love it.
LORELAI: "The number one choice of wooden roller coasters" according to Mr Arthur Levin of about.com.
RORY: Oh yes the venerable Mr Levin, a legend in coast criticism.
LORELAI: So you've heard of him.
RORY: Well of course what coast connoisseur hasn't?
LORELAI: "Great airtime" he says "smooth ride, relentless speed from start to finish" you can admit it if you're scared.
RORY: What I'm not scared, are you scared?
LORELAI: No I'm not scared, I'm not the one who screams.
RORY: That happened once.
LORELAI: Really busted my eardrums.
RORY: You want to keep talking smack or you want to tell me what comes after the Boulder Dash?
LORELAI: How about the "Cyclone" in Coney Island. And then we can head west to the "Millennium Force" Ohio, this calls it a "Giga Roller coaster"
RORY: You know what I say, no hands, eyes open that's right you heard me.
LORELAI: I'll believe it when I see it.
RORY: Well believe it. Okay I am done, 74 résumé's, addressed and sealed.
LORELAI: Not at all excessive.
RORY: Well I just wanted to make sure I didn't leave a stone unturned.
LORELAI: Yes rocks, pebbles, boulders they've all been turned.
RORY: Well I got it all done before our big trip, can you believe it. OH man I have a lot of books.
LORELAI: Hey there is a cool "State-Fare" coaster in Springfield, 50-mile detour, worth it.
RORY: Hum. Aw [pulls something out of a box].
LORELAI: Aw.
RORY: The rocket.
LORELAI: The rocket... Have you talked to him.
RORY: No. It comes in waves, you know, big ones, really close together.
LORELAI: Well the waves will get smaller, I promise. Just have to give it time you know. Have to feel sad and get through it.
RORY: Believe me I'm letting myself feel plenty sad.
LORELAI: Oh that's good, I mean it's not good you know, under the circumstances, it's good.
RORY: I just can't imagine it feeling better.
LORELAI: But it will someday I promise.
RORY: Yeah, do you feel better about Luke?
LORELAI: [Not sounding convincing] Ah, yeah I feel better because I think we're done.
RORY: What, maybe you guys just need more time.
LORELAI: More time, I‘ve given him all the time in the world. Every time I'm venerable or I say something or do something like the song he doesn't do anything.
RORY: Well he's always been a little slow to respond.
LORELAI: Yeah I don't want to make any more excuses you know.
RORY: I just don't think he's over you.
LORELAI: Well it doesn't matter, I'm over him. I need someone who can feel you know, show me how he feels. He can't do that.
RORY: I guess that make sense.
LORELAI: Anyway we're batter as friends you know, don't you think. Like "Hey Luke can I get some coffee", you know friends like that. Like "Hey Luke can you make all the burgers for Rory's re-enactment graduation party?" you know.
RORY: What re-enactment graduation party?
LORELAI: It's just a graduation re-enactment party we're gonna have for all the people who couldn't go to your actual graduation.
RORY: Re-enactment, how?
LORELAI: All you have to do is throw on that cap and gown again, you know and go up on a little podium again, that someone is gonna build and listen to the high school band play "Pomp and Circumstance".
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: What it's a party, it's gonna be fun!
RORY: Ah, you own me.
LORELAI: Okay I'll get you lots of cotton candy and I won't make fun of you when you scream.
RORY: I'm not gonna scream.
LORELAI: Once a screamer, always a screamer.
RORY: I was seven.
LORELAI: Like that counts.
LUKE'S DINER
LUKE: All right, give me 300 hot dogs, 250 burgers.
CHARLIE: How about brats?
LUKE: No brats. And enough buns, obviously, to go with all that.
CHARLIE: Buns got it, you know brats go over very big at outdoor parties.
LUKE: Yeah well I know the woman throwing the party, and she and her daughter are dogs-and-burgers people. Al right the party's Saturday, so I want delivery on Friday okay.
CHARLIE: No sweat. I'll give you half off brats.
LUKE: Somebody cancel a big order, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I tried to tell her, "Lady, nobody eats Bratwurst at a wedding."
LUKE: [chuckling] Right. I'll see you, man. Thanks.
[Opens the door for Liz]
CHARLIE: Hey Liz
LIZ: Oh, hey, chuck, how you doing?
CHARLIE: I'm good.
LIZ: There's your uncle Lukie! Say, "hi, uncle Lukie!"
LUKE: HI Doula,
LIZ: When she just stares like that, that's her way of saying hi.
LUKE: Works for me. How you doing, Liz?
[Hug and smooch over the counter.]
LIZ: Oh pretty good. How about you?
LUKE: Oh, god, I'm crazed. You want something to eat?
LIZ: No, we just stopped by 'cause Doula misses her uncle Lukie. She really misses him.
LUKE: Yeah look I cannot baby-sit today.
LIZ: [begging] Please! I just need a little break.
LUKE: Come on I'm really swamped today al right. Besides, I'm really trying to lay in the stuff for Rory's party next week.
LIZ: Please I really want to get something special for that party, and every item of clothing that I own is covered in spit-up.
LUKE: Sorry.
LIZ: Okay, if you can't do it, you can't do it. So arr, did you give it to her?
LUKE: What?
LIZ: The necklace -- did you give it to Lorelai yet?
LUKE: That was just a backup gift for Rory.
LIZ: Oh come on that was no backup gift. And what about the song?
LUKE: D..d.. f.. forget about the song. The song meant nothing. We're friends. That's it.
LIZ: Oh and you're good with being just friends.
LUKE: Yeah.
LIZ: I don't buy it.
LUKE: Well then maybe you should give her the necklace then. I'm really busy here.
LIZ: Fine, fine. Hey could you mix a sweet potato and a banana in a blender? It's Doula's favorite.
LUKE: Sure. [Goes to make it] And don't slip out while I make it.
GILMORE MANSION – DINNING ROOM
[Emily, Lorelai and Richard are eating]
EMILY: I don't see why Rory had to take this meeting during our Friday night dinners.
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: Well it's not even an interview. If it was an interview, I would understand, but it's a drink.
LORELAI: It's a contact, mom. She's trying to remind him who she is.
RICHARD: As if anyone could forget.
LORELAI: I know. You know Rory wants to make sure she's got her bases covered before we go out of town so that she can relax and have fun.
EMILY: But I don't think this drink should eat into our time.
LORELAI: Well maybe we'll stay later.
EMILY: For after-dinner drinks?
LORELAI: [Sounding hazer dent] Maybe.
EMILY: So, how long will you two be gone?
LORELAI: Oh, a couple weeks, a month.
EMILY: You're riding roller coasters for a month?
LORELAI: As long as our stomachs can take it.
EMILY: This is what Yale graduates do?
LORELAI: Mother she's tired. She needs a break. Plus, this might be my last sh*t.
EMILY: You last sh*t, what are you talking about?
LORELAI: Well, she's gonna get a job, and who knows where? You know, she's gonna move on. This might be the last time I can really spend time with her like this.
EMILY: Honestly, Lorelai, must you be so maudlin?
LORELAI: I'm not being maudlin. I'm being realistic.
RICHARD: So, how are things at the inn?
LORELAI: Oh, good. Busy, but good.
EMILY: I have an idea for you.
LORELAI: Oh, no.
EMILY: Hmm?
LORELAI: Oh, no, don't stop there. Go on.
EMILY: I think you should add a spa to your inn.
LORELAI: A spa?
EMILY: Yes, spas are exploding.
LORELAI: Sounds dangerous.
EMILY: All of our friends are trading island vacations for spa holidays.
LORELAI: I don't know, mom.
EMILY: When I was the Ballantyne Resort, it got me thinking. This is really something I think you should do. Small country inns are old news, Lorelai. Destination spas are what everyone's talking about.
RICHARD: [Nods in agreement]
LORELAI: Mom, I told you business is good. I don't need to rub people with rocks or wrap them in seaweed.
RICHARD: Well, the travel market is fickle. It wouldn't hurt to stay ahead of the curve.
LORELAI: I don't have the money for expansion. [Doorbell rings] Ooh here she is,
EMILY: Will you at least think about it before you say no?
LORELAI: Yes, I will think about it.
RORY: Hi, sorry I'm late.
RICHARD: Rory.
LORELAI: How were the drinks?
RORY: Good, I got a job.
LORELAI: [Gasps]
EMILY: What tonight?
RICHARD: Tonight?
RORY: I leave in three days. I can't leave in three days.
RICHARD: Whe…Wha…Leave where?
LORELAI: What's the job, honey?
RORY: Well, I was having drinks with Hugo Gray, right?
RICHARD: Who's this Hugo Gray?
LORELAI: He runs an online magazine. Rory's been writing for him.
RORY: So we were just talking about different opportunities that might come up and where I've already applied, and he mentioned that the reporter that was covering the Barack Obama campaign for him dropped out because his fiancée got a job in Dubai, so they're moving.
LORELAI: Wow!
RORY: So Hugo asked me if that was something I'd be interested in and I said "yes I would be interested" and he told me more about it and apparently I would be on the campaign trail with the other reporters -- the planes, the buses, the whole deal. And I mean it's only an online magazine, so I wouldn't be staying where the Wall Street Journal people stay at night but…
LORELAI: Who cares?
RORY: But I would be traveling with them. I'd be filing stories from the road right up until the convention.
RICHARD: So have you talked salary yet?
RORY: Yeah, it's next to nothing, but all my meals and travel and hotels would be covered, so I wouldn't have that many expenses.
RICHARD: Well that's fine. You're just starting out. Plus, it sounds like you'll be making excellent contacts.
RORY: I would be.
EMILY: It could be quite grueling, Rory -- all that constant travel, the seedy motels.
LORELAI: She can handle it.
RORY: I hope so. I said yes.
LORELAI: That's great.
RORY: It is, right?
LORELAI: Ah you're gonna be working on a presidential campaign.
RORY: I know but that also mean in three days I'd be leaving for who knows how long. It could be two months, it could be two years if Barack does well. And what does that mean -- I'm only gonna come home on holidays? That's crazy. And I need some transition time, and the roller coasters -- how am I gonna go on all the roller coasters if I have to leave and have to be in Iowa on Monday at the town hall meeting at the Quality Inn and Suites Ballroom in Sioux City?
LORELAI: You're gonna be fine.
RORY: [Sighs] What about the roller coasters?
LORELAI: We'll do it another time. This is what you've been working for.
RORY: Yeah. I guess it is. [Sighs] I would have credentials -- real press credentials. Isn't that crazy?
LORELAI: It's not crazy.
EMILY: So, this is it. This is the last time we'll see you for who knows how long.
RORY: Oh, yeah, I guess it is.
[A few moments of silence]
LORELAI: After-dinner drinks for sure.
RICHARD: [Raising his glass] Hear, hear.
LUKE'S DINER
[Lorelai and Rory enter]
RORY: But this list they gave me is just ridiculous. Where am I gonna find a laptop car adapter by tomorrow?
LORELAI: 24-hour laptop-car-adapter store.
RORY: Seriously, mom.
LORELAI: Well honey that's our mission today. We'll buy or borrow. Hey, Caesar, is Luke around?
CAESAR: Sure. How are we today, ladies?
LORELAI: Fine.
RORY: We'll be finer with a little coffee.
LORELAI: Two to go, please.
CAESAR: With pleasure. Hey, Luke, you got company. Here, let me take that.
[Caesar grabs hold of some plates Luke is carrying]
LUKE: I got it.
CAESAR: Let me.
LUKE: I'm fine.
CAESAR: It's not a problem.
LUKE: It's becoming one. Take it. All right.
CAESAR: Sorry.
LUKE: Hey. [Tot Lorelai] Hey, Rory!
RORY: Hi.
LORELAI: Hi, what was all that about?
LUKE: Oh he's just trying to show me he can handle things, you know if I leave.
LORELAI: If?
LUKE: Well t he boat trip's been cancelled, but Caesar's got it in his head that I'm gonna leave at some point so he can prove he can -- whatever.
CAESAR: Java one, java two.
LORELAI: Thanks [Too Luke] So, Luke... [Sighs] Remember all the burgers and hot dogs I ordered for Rory's party a week from Saturday?
LUKE: Yeah, sure.
LORELAI: I have to cancel them.
LUKE: Why?
LORELAI: Well the party's cancelled.
KIRK: Wait a second, did you just say Rory's graduation party is cancelled?
LORELAI: Oh ho, it's good news. [Pointing to Rory] Someone got a job.
LULU: What job?
RORY: I'm gonna be a reporter for an online magazine.
LORELAI: Oh it's better than that -- she's going to Iowa, and she's gonna be on the campaign bus with Barack Obama.
[Blank looks and silence from Kirk, Lulu, Babette and Miss Patty sitting at some tables]
BABETTE: No party at all?
LORELAI: Babette.
LUKE: Congratulations. That's great news.
RORY: Thank you. Yeah I'm really excited, but I'm nervous. I have to be a real reporter, yikes.
LUKE: You'll be a great one.
LORELAI: She will, so, sorry, but no Rory, no party.
BABETTE: But you promised us a re-enactment.
KIRK: We can still do the re-enactment. Remember my suggestion -- Lulu plays Rory?
MISS PATTY: It's not the same, Kirk. And I was so looking forward to having a good cry at the re-enactment..
LORELAI: Uh, okay. You want a re-enactment? We can, we can give you one right, right now. Uh come on, Rory. Okay, so watch this. [Sings "pomp and circumstance"] Okay, and, everybody, the graduate, Lorelai Leigh Gilmore. Ooh. Ooh. Here you go. And shake the hand.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you. And you are one of tomorrow's future leaders today.
RORY: I am so happy. I am so glad to have graduated Summa-cum-Luke.
LORELAI: And then the thing. [miming the moving of the tassel on the hat] Okay. Yay!
BABETTE: That's not how I imagined it.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, guys. I wish we could do the party. I really do. We just don't have time. She's leaving in two days.
MISS PATTY: Two days?
RORY: I know. It's really soon.
LORELAI: We just have a lot to do.
BABETTE: So this is goodbye?
RORY: No this isn't goodbye, I'm gonna come by tomorrow and visit everybody. I'm not ready for this to be the real goodbye.
LORELAI: Yeah this is more like a "see you later."
RORY: Yeah, I'll see you guys later.
LORELAI: Okay? So see you later.
[They get their coffees and stuff.]
RORY: Bye
LUKE: See ya.
BABETTE: Bye, dollfaces. [Heavily sighs] No party.
[Luke also looks sad]
DRAGONFLY INN - KITCHEN
[Sookie is cooking, Luke enters]
LUKE: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hey, Luke, how's it going?
LUKE: Good. It's going good. How are you?
SOOKIE: Ooh Good. Hey, I apologize for the smell in here, but I'm making bouillabaisse. It's kind of at the stinkiest part -- a lot of uncooked fish and garlic.
LUKE: It smells good to me.
SOOKIE: Well you're very kind. You looking for Lorelai? 'Cause she's out and about, and I don't know when she's coming back.
LUKE: Yeah, I know. I saw her in town.
SOOKIE: Oh.
LUKE: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Yeah. So, what's up?
LUKE: Well, you know she cancelled Rory's graduation party?
SOOKIE: Yeah. I mean I knew that kid wouldn't last a whole summer at home before landing some kind of amazing job, but, god, it happened so lightning fast.
LUKE: You know I was thinking maybe we should throw it anyway.
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah?
LUKE: Yeah, I mean it's a week sooner than we planned, but there's no reason we can't do it.
SOOKIE: I guess not.
LUKE: And I think we should make it a surprise party.
SOOKIE: Who doesn't love a surprise?
LUKE: Yeah I got all the hot dogs and the hamburgers, and the buns are on their way today anyway.
SOOKIE: You know, that's a very sweet idea Luke.
LUKE: Yeah, I think Rory would really love it.
SOOKIE: I think Lorelai would love it.
LUKE: Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.
SOOKIE: Yeah, Rory and Lorelai.
[Giggles and chuckles]
SOOKIE: I think we should do it!
LUKE: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah.
LUKE: All right. I'll start telling everybody.
SOOKIE: Okay what do you need from me?
LUKE: Desserts.
SOOKIE: Aha! Well, I'm all over it.
LUKE: Okay.
SOOKIE: Give Jackson a call.
LUKE: Okay.
SOOKIE: He'll help you with whatever you need.
LUKE: Al right Okay, thanks, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LUKE: All right, bye.
STARS HOLLOW – NEAR WESTON'S
[Lorelai and Rory are walking]
RORY: I don't know, I think it would have made more sense to get a regular-sized shampoo bottle instead of 20 tiny ones.
LORELAI: With the big bottle you got to lug it off and on the bus.
RORY: Lug! How big do they make them?
LORELAI: Look the little bottles give you as much shampoo without the weight. Perfect for travel -- plus, they're cute.
RORY: Al right. Oh, I want to stop by the post office. I want to get tons of blank postcards. You are gonna get so many postcards.
LORELAI: You could just e-mail me.
RORY: Yeah but postcard-sending is a dying art form. Right, and it's nice to get mail.
LORELAI: Sure.
RORY: Plus, we'll talk all the time.
LORELAI: Yeah. What else do you need?
RORY: Um, a mini book light. Ah man I had a mini book light, but I lent it to Paris. And by "lent," I mean she totally stole it.
LORELAI: I think we have a mini book light in the lost and found at the inn. It's been there like a month.
RORY: Oh poor rejected book light.
LORELAI: Maybe you should adopt it and give it the love it needs.
RORY: All right. Check.
LORELAI: What else do we need? Ooh, hey, I have a great idea. Come here.
RORY: What, where are we going?
[They head towards Miss Pattys.]
LORELAI: Remember last year when Miss Patty hurt her back during rehearsal for spring fling?
RORY: Oh yeah she should have never demonstrated the Jetés for the little daffodils.
LORELAI: She had one of those back-support things that you put on top of chairs. I bet she'd loan that to you.
RORY: Yeah but do I really want to be known as "back-support-thingy girl"?
LORELAI: AH, hello, two-hour speech, metal folding chairs, and now I'll take questions for an hour.
RORY: Just call me "back-support-thingy girl."
[Lorelai knocks on the door, no response]
LORELAI: That's weird. She never locks this.
RORY: Miss Patty?
LORELAI: Miss Patty?
[Lorelai knocks again as the door opens just enough for miss Patty to stick her head out]
MICHEL: Oh, hello, girls.
LORELAI: Hi, is everything okay?
LORELAI: Oh, yes, everything is fine. I'M...consulting with my muse.
RORY: Your muse?
MISS PATTY: Yes! whenever I want to think up a new dance routine, I come in here alone, lie down on the floor in the dark, and I let the muse inspire me. Did you want something?
LORELAI: That's okay, we'll come back when you're not with your muse.
MISS PATTY: Okay, good.
LORELAI: Okay, well, so we'll...
[The door is abruptly slid close]
LORELAI: [To a closed door] See you later.
RORY: Odd.
LORELAI: Very odd.
MISS PATTY‘S
[They whole meeting is lined up against the wall so if Lorelai looked in eh would no see them]
MISS PATTY: Okay, they're gone.
BABETTE: Good. Let's get this meeting going.
[The lights are turned on and they start to take their seats.]
TAYLOR: Once again, this is not a "meeting," per se. We have already broken several Robert's rules of order.
BABETTE: So don't tell Robert.
LANE: Yeah besides, isn't it worth breaking rules over? It is Rory, for god's sake.
BABETTE: So lets start divvying up the duties, who's gonna do the food?
LUKE: I got hot dogs and hamburgers and a couple of big grills in the square, and Sookie's got the rest covered, right Jackson?
JACKSON: She's at home baking right now. You name the fruit, it'll be in one of her pies.
[Murmurs from the crowd]
MOREY: Can she make a sour-cream/peach pie?
JACKSON: I'll put it on the list.
KIRK: I'd like a blackberry.
JACKSON: Oh she makes a wicked blackberry and cranberry.
MISS PATTY: What about cherry? Cherry is a classic.
[The crowd all talking at once]
TAYLOR: Please, could we stay focused? People, this gathering is unofficial, as such I would like to have it over with as soon as possible. Now, Luke, I assume you have obtained permits to use two large grills with open flame on our town square?
LUKE: [Flustered] Uh, no, I don't, I don't have any permits. I just, I just started this whole thing a couple hours ago.
TAYLOR: Outdoor barbecuing sans permit is a violation of town codes. As selectman, I can't approve that.
[The crowd complains.]
BABETTE: Hey Taylor If this meeting is unofficial, then whatever you say is unofficial, so Luke's barbecuing, what else.
LANE: Music. There's got to be music.
LUKE: Yeah, who's got a good sound system?
MOREY: Yo!
KIRK: I believe I can also be of some help in this area. I'd gladly donate my time and expertise as deejay. Did a little deejay work back in college. Went by the moniker "Captain K."
LULU: He's really good at scratching.
BABETTE: Yeah we've all seen that.
LUKE: Okay what about decorations?
LULU: I have a bunch of stuff left from a school birthday party – Mylar balloons, streamers.
TAYLOR: There are not going to be any Mylar balloons. They are infamous for floating up and catching on power lines. It could cause an outage for the whole town.
MOREY: The closest power lines are six miles out of town.
[The crowd complains again.]
TAYLOR: Nonetheless…
LUKE: [Standing up] Nonetheless, Lulu, why don't you bring those balloons and whatever else you got?
TAYLOR: You people are violating town ordinances left and right. This is highly irregular.
ZACH: Dude, you're who's highly irregular.
[Crowd all shouting]
TAYLOR: Excuse me?
LUKE: I don't know what your problem is, but the town wants to throw this party, and you're either gonna join us or you're gonna stay home and comb your beard.
[Crowed all shouting]
LUKE: Okay, all right, we're gonna need chairs and tables and volunteers to set them up around the gazebo. Okay we're all gonna get started in the square tonight after dark, okay?
[All talking at once, as they get up to start work on the party.]
TAYLOR: This will remain an unofficial party, you hear men, unofficial!



STARS HOLLOW - TOWN SQUARE
[Nighttime, Lorelai and Rory walking]
RORY: You should come along. It would be fun.
LORELAI: No you need some alone time with Lane.
RORY: Yeah but it's cutting into our you-and-me time.
LORELAI: There's plenty of time.
RORY: 36 hours is not plenty of time.
LORELAI: That's not true. Imagine if you had a 36-hour flight. That would seem like a long time, right?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: All right plus, I have to go to Sookie and Jackson's to get you that fanny pack.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: What "really"?
RORY: You honestly think I'm gonna wear a fanny pack?
LORELAI: All I know is, it's on the list, and if it's on the list, I'm getting it for you. You think Tom Brokaw's mother sent him off to his first campaign with no fanny pack?
RORY: When, when in my right mind would I…
LORELAI: Perhaps the senator might like a piece of gum, and no one has any, and then they say, "what about that girl with the lime-green fanny pack?"
[oblivious to the girls some townies start moving tables in the back ground, they see the girls, turn and leave before they see them]
RORY: "Lime-green" I would be "Lime-green fanny pack girl."
LORELAI: And they bring you over to him, and he says, [using a mans voice] "Hello young lady, what is your name?" [Pretending to be Rory] "My name's Rory Gilmore. Here's your gum." [Normal voice] And like that, you're gum buddies with the future president of the United States!
RORY: Oh when you put it that way -- gum buddies.
LORELAI: All right look, I'll meet you back at home, okay?
RORY: Okay but take a nap, 'cause we're staying up really late.
LORELAI: I don't need a nap to stay up really late.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Give my love to Lane and the boys.
[They kiss on the cheeks]
RORY: I will. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
[Lorelai looks around to where the townies were with the table but they have long gone.]
LANE AND ZACH'S APARTMENT – EXTERIOR
[Lane and Rory seated on a bench]
LANE: Billy Fink.
RORY: You did not!
LANE: I did.
RORY: But Dave Rogalski.
LANE: Not technically my first kiss.
RORY: How did I not know this?
LANE: I was too ashamed to ever tell you. I mean how would you feel if your first kiss was Billy Fink?
RORY: Well just 'cause he didn't come out of the gates strong doesn't mean he didn't turn into a very handsome, dashing billionaire.
LANE: He didn't, I ran into him a few years ago, and he's living with his mom and sells shoes in Norwich.
RORY: Oh. Well, maybe he'll sell billions of shoes.
LANE: [Chuckles] How weird is this? Yesterday we're sitting on your porch playing jacks and praying to grow boobs, and now look at us. I have a husband and two babies in there, and you're about to go off and conquer the world, or at least write about it.
RORY: We've come a long way, baby.
LANE: I'll say.
ZACH: Babe.
LANE: Yeah.
ZACH: Can I talk to you a sec?
LANE: Sure what's up?
ZACH: In private.
LANE: Oh, well, I'll be right back.
RORY: Okay.
ZACH: Sorry, Rory.
RORY: No problem.
[Lane goes inside]
LANE: The kids okay?
ZACH: Sound asleep.
LANE: They what's going on?
ZACH: I just got a call from Luke, and they want to start setting up the square for tomorrow.
LANE: Yeah so?
ZACH: So the honoree is sitting on our porch looking out onto the square, and they can't set up until she goes home.
LANE: It's my last night with my best friend.
[Lane starts walking outside]
ZACH: Well, could you move it along, because it's getting late and we were just trying…[[Lane stops and turns to look at Zach] Hey, I'm just the messenger. [Lane looking mad] You're done when you're done. I'll let them know.
LANE: U-Hmm.
[Lane goes outside again.]
LANE: Sorry about that. [Seeing Rory sad] What's wrong?
RORY: I don't know. In the past two minutes sitting here, I've managed to completely freak myself out. The call I haven't really had a chance to stop and think about it, but I just stopped and thought, and I am really nervous.
LANE: Totally understandable.
RORY: But I'm, like, panic-attack nervous.
LANE: Rory, you're gonna do an amazing job, okay? You always do.
RORY: See? I hate that.
LANE: What?
RORY: Everyone thinking I'm gonna do an amazing job all the time, like it's a given. It's not a given. What if I'm a terrible reporter?
LANE: Then you'll figure out how to get better. [Sighs] Rory, the reason why everybody knows you're gonna do an amazing job is because everybody knows you. Yeah, you're gonna be nervous. I mean I was nervous before I had the babies. I was throwing up all the time.
RORY: You were pregnant.
LANE: True, but that was 30% pregnancy, 70% fear of being the world's worst mom.
RORY: I don't know. I just don't know about just picking up and leaving until who knows when and leaving my mom -- see? I'm not ready. What reporter freaks out about leaving their mom?
LANE: The lucky kind.
RORY: It's embarrassing.
LANE: How is she holding up?
RORY: She's fine. She's not freaked out at all. She's making lists and buying fanny packs. She's not even a little bit sentimental.
LANE: Your mom?
RORY: Yeah. She's really fine.
LANE: I'm sure she's freaking out on the inside.
RORY: I don't know. Maybe. [short pause] Lane...
LANE: Yeah?
RORY: I just… your friendship means so much to me. It's so...
LANE: Me, too.
RORY: I mean, I don't know what it's like to have a sister, but I feel like I do, you know?
LANE: Yeah.
RORY: Mrs. Van Gerbig.
LANE: Ms. Gilmore.
LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory enters]
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Oh, hey!
RORY: You're ironing?
LORELAI: The flatter the clothes, the more will fit in your suitcase.
RORY: Oh right.
LORELAI: How was Lane's?
RORY: It was sad, saying goodbye.
LORELAI: I'll bet. Oh Sookie wants you to come by tomorrow and say goodbye to her. I made her a promise that you would.
RORY: Sure.
LORELAI: And I got that fanny pack from Jackson. I think you're right. -- you're never gonna wear it unless you want to be relentlessly teased but the other reporters.
RORY: Not so much.
LORELAI: But who knows? Maybe you should take it. You know maybe they're teasing reporters who don't have fanny packs. Who knows what the reporter teasing edict is these days.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: I don't get it.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: How can you be so okay with everything? Ever since I've told you that I'm leaving, you're just all busy with shopping and packing, and you seem fine with it.
LORELAI: [Sighs] It's too soon.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: If I stop to think about you leaving now, I'm gonna fall apart. We still have time left. It's too soon.
[A few moments silence]
RORY: Here. I'll iron. You fold.
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
LUKE: Hey, guys, only six chairs to a table.
ZACH: I think we can go eight if we grab more from the high school.
BRIAN: The door's chained, but I can slip through, I'm skinny like that.
LUKE: Six is fine. Not everybody's gonna be sitting down at once.
MISS PATTY: We found enough tablecloths.
LUKE: Great.
WOMAN: It turns out that East-Side Tillie had a stash down in her basement.
MISS PATTY: Woke her up out of a dead sleep. She couldn't have been more annoyed. It was fantastic.
LUKE: Thanks.
ASIAN CAESAR: Hey Luke, I got the turntable. What's next?
LUKE: Why don't you help Kirk and Lulu with the lights.
ASIAN CAESAR: Okay will do.
LUKE: Kirk, careful stringing those lights, okay? One of those light bulbs blows, and the whole thing's useless.
JACKSON: Luke, what do you think about these?
LUKE: What do I think about what?
JACKSON: The centerpieces.
LUKE: Oh nice.
JACKSON: Sookie's idea, my vegetables.
LUKE: All right, great. Thanks.
BABETTE: Luuuuuke! Luke! [Running up]
LUKE: Yeah, Babette, over here.
BABETTE: Oh, Luke! My ankles! Look at my ankles!
LUKE: Should I ask why?
BABETTE: Bad news, doll, it's gonna rain.
LUKE: What?
BABETTE: Oh, yeah look at these ankles. They haven't been this swollen since hurricane bob. So then I checked the weather channel, and sure enough, Nick Walker confirmed it. There's a storm front moving in over Connecticut.
LUKE: It's gonna rain tomorrow?
BABETTE: First thing in the AM, Nick Walker -- you a Nick Walker fan?
LUKE: No.
BABETTE: Oh, you should be. He's just terrific -- always dead on and so charming. Of course, I've always had a thing for meteorologists. They're kinda like astronauts crossed with fortune tellers, very intriguing Anyway, he says it's definite.
LUKE: Oh.
BABETTE: Yeah, so I thought you'd want to know. Sorry for the bad news, but you know my ankles.
LUKE: No, that's true. They're never wrong.
BABETTE: No, no, My hair's only 50-50, but my ankles -- you could take them to the bank.
MISS PATTY: What we gonna do?
ZACH: We could have it in the diner.
LUKE: How you gonna fit 200 people in a diner?
ZACH: In shifts?
BABETTE: Oh what a shame.
BRIAN: Maybe we can break the party up into people's houses, like little party stations.
LUKE: You gonna wake up the whole town and arrange that?
BRIAN: It sounded dumb while I was saying it.
LUKE: I can't believe it's gonna rain tomorrow.
JACKSON: You don't suppose anybody has any idea where we could get a big wedding tent at one o'clock in the morning?
BABETTE: [Sighs]
ZACH: It was a nice idea, man.
[Luke is deep in thought]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – RORY'S ROOM
[Lorelai comes to the door and looks at Rory sleeping, then sits on her bed, almost crying.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is sewing together lots of tarps and stuff.] He goes to the draw and pulls out the necklace box.]
STARS HOLLOW – TOWN SQUARE
[Lorelai and Rory in the Jeep, it raining heavy]
RORY: Why is no one picking up their phones? I want to say goodbye to everyone.
LORELAI: We'll track them all down, I promise. [Gasps] Rory, look.
[Just about the whole town is under a giant tent cheering, there is a Bon Voyage sign to Rory.]
LORELAI: I think you're gonna get to say goodbye to everybody.
[Cheering continues as Zach and Jackson come out to the Jeep with umbrellas.]
RORY: Did you...
LORELAI: No, I didn't do a thing.
[Cheers and applause as the girls run back to the tent with the guys. They girls look on in amazement.]
LANE: We love you, Rory!
[Indistinct shouting as the camera pans the crowd.]
LORELAI: Whoo!
RORY: Whoo! Yeah!
GYPSY: We love you, Rory!
BABETTE: We're so proud of you.
[Shouting continues]
LORELAI: Wow.
RORY: Wow.
[The cheering dies down]
KIRK: Rory, in my official capacity as town sash presenter, I would like to present you with this sash, which I also happened to make in my official capacity as town sash maker.
RORY: Well, thank you.
KIRK: Kneel before me. [Rory looks concerned] All right, could you at least bow your head a little bit?
LORELAI: Wow. That's quite a sash.
KIRK: I got the material from one of mother's nighties.
RORY: Ew!
MISS PATTY: We wouldn't let you go without a party, sweetheart!
BABETTE: All right, no shoving. Let's make a line. Everybody gets a chance to hug Rory.
LORELAI: I see mom and dad. I'll be right back.
[Emily and Richard are standing alone off to the side.]
LORELAI: Hey.
RICHARD: This is quite a party.
LORELAI: I know. It is, isn't it?
EMILY: We had to cancel a lunch with the Stuttgart's because we only heard about it from Sookie last night.
RICHARD: Emily, that hardly matters.
EMILY: I didn't say it mattered. I was merely relaying the fact.
LORELAI: Well, anyway, I'm glad you're here.
RICHARD: We wouldn't miss it.
EMILY: Of course we wouldn't. We're her grandparents.
LORELAI: I can't believe they did this for her.
RICHARD: I don't think this is all for Rory. I think this party's a testament to you, Lorelai, and the home you've created here. I regret that you needed…
EMILY: Richard.
RICHARD: Now, let me finish, Emily. I regret it, and we've…recent experience have taught me…
EMILY: Oh, please don't become one of those "I had a heart attack, let me express my every thought" types.
RICHARD: Not every thought, dear, just this one. It takes a r-- [Voice breaking] A remarkable person to inspire all of this.
LORELAI: Thanks, dad.
[A few moments silence]
EMILY: Okay, that's enough. It's not as though the two of you are saying goodbye.
TAYLOR: May I have your attention, please? I'd like to welcome you all to this Bon Voyage party in honor of one of Stars Hollow's favorite daughters, Ms. Rory Gilmore!
[Cheers and applause]
RICHARD: Brava! Brava!
TAYLOR: I've known Rory, as have most of you...
EMILY: Have you given any thought to my spa idea?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. I don't think I'm interested, though.
TAYLOR: ...Glorious spring day, pregnant with pride and anticipation, preparing to birth you from our collective womb, fully gestated and nourished. And so we breathe deep, and, with these last, painful contractions, we push you out into the world, spank your bottom, and wipe the amniotic fluid from your eyes as you issue your first independent breath.
EMILY: Is this speech making you a little queasy?
LORELAI: A little bit.
TAYLOR: Rory, would you like to say a few words?
[Cheers and applause]
RORY: Thank you, Taylor, for that very unique tribute. Um... I love this place. I...I just loved growing up here, and I love all of you. And thank you so much for doing all of this. It's amazing. I just -- it's so -- oh, I'm on the verge of gushing, so I'm just gonna stop myself here. I don't want to gush, except one more thing -- to my mom, who is just everything to me and everything I am and who I'm gonna miss so much.
[Lorelai looks on almost crying, she nods]
TAYLOR: [Chuckles] All right, let's get this party started.
[Later, the rain has stopped and it's nighttime, Kool & the Gang's "celebration" plays, people are dancing, we pan to see Luke serving with Lorelai nearby.]
WOMAN: No bratwurst?
LUKE: No bratwurst.
WOMAN: Just corn, then.
LUKE: What can I get you?
LORELAI: Can't decide.
MAN: Hey Luke, I'll have two hamburgers, medium rare.
LUKE: Hold on a sec.
EMILY: Lorelai, we really should be going, but I want to say goodbye to Rory.
LORELAI: I guess I'll eat later.
EMILY: Now, listen, instead of a spa, what about a tennis court? People love tennis. You could put a bubble over it.
LORELAI: Oh, god.
EMILY: Outside the inn you could use it during the summer and winter. There's really no downside.
LORELAI: Um-hmm.
EMILY: Now it's expensive, but your father and I have discussed it, and we are willing to loan you the money.
LORELAI: Oh, mother.
EMILY: Standard terms, no interest.
LORELAI: Mom, why do you want to loan me money?
EMILY: All it would require is the three of us sit down and hash out the details. Obviously we want to get together with you from time to time to see how things are progressing, but we wouldn't become pests about it.
LORELAI: Mom, why don't we just talk about it Friday night at dinner?
EMILY: Oh, so our Friday-night dinners are going to continue, then?
LORELAI: Well, we might as well. I've kind of gotten used to it.
EMILY: All right. That sounds fine. But don't be late and don't wear jeans.
LORELAI: When have I ever worn jeans to dinner?
EMILY: Well I don't know, it could very well be Rory who enforces the dress code. I'm just saying I don't think that jeans are appropriate.
LORELAI: Fine, spandex and a tube top it is.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey.
RICHARD: My dear.
EMILY: Oh, thank you. Now, listen, you keep in touch, and not just postcards -- phone calls as well.
RORY: Of course.
EMILY: It's an honor to be your grandmother, Rory Gilmore.
RORY: Well, thank you, I… thank you for everything.
EMILY: Oh, dear.
RORY: I'll walk you guys to your car.
[Music "Celebrate good times, come on"]
SOOKIE: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey!
SOOKIE: It's beautiful, isn't it?
LORELAI: It's so beautiful. I can't believe you pulled it off.
SOOKIE: No, I just did all the baking. This was all Luke.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: He made me promise not to tell you, but I don't care. This is all Luke. He did all of it. He's the one that came to me and said, "let's do the party," and then he planned the secret town meeting, everything.
LORELAI: Really?
SOOKIE: Yeah. I mean last night when we thought it was gonna rain and we'd have to cancel the party, he went around and collected everybody's tarps and tents and raincoats. I don't know how he did it. He must have stayed up all night doing this. Can you believe that?
LORELAI: Yeah… I'll be back.
SOOKIE: Okay.
LORELAI: Hey, Kirk.
KIRK: [Yelling] I can't hear you! My eardrum popped!
TAYLOR: Lorelai, if you see Luke, tell him that he and he alone is responsible for all party cleanup.
LORELAI: Okay.
BABETTE: Lorelai, you want to make a Morey sandwich?
LORELAI: Maybe later, Babette.
[Music, Jackson 5 "Let me show you what it's all about reading and writing, arithmetic". Luke exits the diner, Lorelai walks up to him. The Mighty Lemon Drops' "Inside Out" plays]
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
[Both sigh]
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: Oh, it's...no big deal.
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: I just... like to see you happy.
[Luke and Lorelai move in at the same time and they kiss. Holding each other tight as the volume of the music playing rises so does the camera to show to party in the background lyrics "You can't stop my heart from turning inside out try and stop my world from turning inside out you can't stop my heart from turning inside out"]
LORELAI'S HOUSE – LIVING ROOM
LORELAI: Okay, you have these. Oh, honey, let me help you with that.
RORY: I got it.
LORELAI: Oh, no, I got it.
RORY: I know how to work a zipper, mom.
LORELAI: Okay. That's it, huh?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Got everything?
RORY: I think so.
LORELAI: Oh, what about this?
RORY: That's for the plane.
LORELAI: Oh, how about these?
RORY: Um, those are old and broken. I have new ones.
LORELAI: I just feel like I need more time.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: I really just feel ambushed, you know? I thought I had so much more...time. I thought I had all summer to impart my wisdom about work and life and your future, and I feel like I had something to tell you. Oh, on the bus, make sure you choose a good seat, you know because people are creatures of habit, and the seat you pick in the beginning could be your seat for the rest of the year. You know. Get a window seat, honey, 'cause there's so much to see. And you might want to sit in the back, because people there tend to be more chatty and friendly and -- I don't know what it is about the front of the bus, you know but people there just tend to be a little more bossy and uptight. It's just been that way since first grade. And, honey, I know what you're gonna say, but just don't wear shorts, okay no matter how hot it is. It's not professional, and all that heat and those sticky vinyl seats -- it'll be like ripping a band-aid off your thigh every time you stand up. Don't be too shy. Don't be too forward, but don't be too shy, 'cause you make a lovely first impression, but you really grow on people, too.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: You need ziplock bags. You should have them all the time, they're so handy.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: And I'm gonna give you that orange sweater. I know you've wanted it, and I'm you know what finally gonna give it to you.
RORY: Mom…You've given me everything I need.
LORELAI: [Sighs] Okay.
RORY: Okay.
LORELAI: Shall we?
RORY: What's the rush? It's, like, 5:00 A.M.
LORELAI: Got a stop to make.
[Lorelai grabs the bags and exits, followed by Rory who takes one quick last look.]
LUKE'S DINER
[Luke is pouring coffee for Lorelai and Rory.]
RORY: Mmm. The coffee smells good.
LORELAI: Hello, old friend.
LUKE: How is it?
RORY: Mmm.
LORELAI: Your first pot is always your best.
LUKE: Good.
RORY: Thanks for opening up the place.
LUKE: I got to take care of my best customers.
RORY: [giggles]
LUKE: So, you guys know what you want?
LORELAI: Oh, hmm, I have no idea.
RORY: Looks like a delightful menu.
LORELAI: Oh, it does look delightful, charming.
RORY: Very charming, adorable fonts.
LORELAI: I wish there were pictures.
LUKE: Hmm.
LORELAI: You know, I'm gonna need a minute. I can't decide.
LUKE: Take all the time you need.
[Rory smiles as Luke walks away from the table.]
LORELAI: But could we get some eggs and bacon and hash browns to tide us over?
LUKE: Coming up.
LORELAI: And pancakes?
RORY: Hey, I like your necklace.
LORELAI: Oh, you do?
[Lorelai looks over her shoulder towards the kitchen]
RORY: It suits you.
LORELAI: Thanks. Hey you got to be careful when you drink coffee on the bus, it's bumpy.
RORY: I can handle it.
LORELAI: I should have gotten you a sippy cup.
RORY: Maybe I should get a flask.
LORELAI: Do they make flasks for hot beverages?
RORY: Yeah they're called thermoses.
LORELAI: Right, I'll get you a thermos that says "World's Greatest Reporter" to match your cap.
RORY: Oh, yeah, I meant to tell you that I left that cap at home.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Well It wasn't very flattering.
LORELAI: Well how will people know you're the world's greatest reporter?
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: I guess they'll just have to read your stuff.
RORY: I guess so.
[The camera pulls back as the girls continue to talk, Luke gets their breakfast ready in the background.]
