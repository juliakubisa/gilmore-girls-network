OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai walks down the sidewalk. She passes a sign that says "Stars Hollow Founded 1779" and crosses the street. She goes into Luke's Diner. Inside, she takes off her coat and picks up an empty mug from a table, then walks up to the counter]
LORELAI: Please, Luke. Please, please, please.
LUKE: How many cups have you had this morning?
LORELAI: None.
LUKE: Plus...
LORELAI: Five, but yours is better.
LUKE: You have a problem.
LORELAI: Yes, I do.
[Luke fills her cup]
LUKE: Junkie.
LORELAI: Angel. You've got wings, baby.
[The phone rings as Lorelai goes back to her table. Luke answers it.]
LUKE: Luke's. [pause] Yeah.
[A young guy seated at the counter turns and watches Lorelai sip her coffee, then gets up and approaches her.]
JOEY: You make that look really good.
LORELAI: Oh, it is really good. It's the best coffee in town.
JOEY: Oh yeah? I'll have to get a cup.
LORELAI: Good plan.
JOEY: Yeah, I've never been here before. Just, uh, passing through on my way to Hartford.
LORELAI: You're a regular Jack Kerouac.
JOEY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Yeah.
JOEY: Hey, you mind if I sit down?
LORELAI: Oh, you know what? Actually, I'm meeting someone so I. . .
[Joey sits down at her table]
JOEY: I'm Joey.
LORELAI: Okay.
JOEY: What, you don't have a name?
LORELAI: No, I do have a name. I just, I'm really meeting someone, so. . .
JOEY: So I guess I should get going.
LORELAI: So soon?
JOEY: What?
LORELAI: I'm just screwing with your mind, Joey. It's nice to meet you. Enjoy Hartford.
JOEY: Enjoy your coffee, mystery woman.
LORELAI: Hm. I like that.
[As Joey goes back to the counter, Rory walks in and sits across from Lorelai.]
RORY: Hey. It's freezing.
LORELAI: Oh, what do you need? Hot tea, coffee?
RORY: Lip gloss.
LORELAI: Aha.
[Lorelai pulls a makeup bag out of her purse.]
LORELAI: I have vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and toasted marshmallow.
RORY: Anything in there not resembling a breakfast cereal?
LORELAI: Yes.
[Lorelai pulls out another bag.]
LORELAI: It has no smell but it changes colors with your mood.
RORY: God, RuPaul doesn't need this much makeup.
LORELAI: Wow, you're crabby.
RORY: I'm sorry. I lost my Macy Gray CD and I need caffeine.
LORELAI: Ooh, I have your CD. [pulls the CD out of her purse]
RORY: Thief.
LORELAI: Sorry, and I will get you some coffee.
[Lorelai picks up another coffee cup and goes back to the counter. Luke gives her a look.]
LORELAI: What? It's not for me. It's for Rory, I swear.
LUKE: You're shameless.
[Behind Lorelai, Joey approaches Rory's table.]
LORELAI: Look, Officer Krupke. She's right at that table, right over there.
[Lorelai turns to point to Rory and sees Joey talking to her. Luke fills the coffee cup.]
LORELAI: Ah. He's got quite a pair, this guy. [Lorelai takes the cup.] Thanks.
[Lorelai goes back to the table.]
JOEY: [to Rory] Yeah, I've never been through here before.
LORELAI: Oh, you have, too.
JOEY: Oh, hi.
LORELAI: Oh, hi. You really like my table, don't you?
JOEY: I was just, uh. . .
LORELAI: Getting to know my daughter.
JOEY: Your. . .
RORY: Are you my new daddy?
JOEY: Wow. You do not look old enough to have a daughter. No, I mean it. And you do not look like a daughter.
LORELAI: That's possibly very sweet of you. Thanks.
JOEY: So. . .daughter. You know, I am traveling with a friend.
LORELAI: She's sixteen.
JOEY: Bye.
LORELAI: Drive safe.
[Joey and his friend exit the diner.]
[opening credits]
CUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN
[Lorelai walks into the lobby and hands a key to a bellboy.]
LORELAI: Oh, here you go.
BELLBOY: Thanks.
[Lorelai walks to the front desk, where Michel is on the phone and sorting mail]
MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. [pause] No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked. [pause] We have a wedding party here. [pause] No, there is really nothing I can do. [pause] Yes, I'm sure. [pause] Positive. [pause] No, I don't have to look ma'am, I -- [pause] Yes, of course I'll look.
[Michel puts the phone down, continues to sort the mail, then picks the phone back up.]
MICHEL: No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked.
[Drella pushes her harp through the crowded lobby.]
DRELLA: Oh, no, don't move. Just ignore the tiny woman pushing the 200-pound instrument around. No, this is good, I like this. After this I'll, uh, bench press a piano, huh? [Drella stops behind a woman bent over tying her shoe.] Oh, that's it, lady, tie your shoe now. Yeah, don't worry, I'll wait.
[Lorelai walks over to her]
LORELAI: Hi, Drella, hi. I was just wondering, um, could you be, uh, nicer to the guests?
DRELLA: I'm sorry. Did you not want a harp player?
LORELAI: Yes, I did.
DRELLA: And did you not want a great harp player?
LORELAI: Yes, I did.
DRELLA: Okay. I am a great harp player, and this is my great harp, okay. So if you're looking for someone to just be nice to the guests, get a harmonica player, or maybe some guy who whistles through his nose. Okay? Capisce?
[Lorelai backs off and walks away. Drella goes back to pushing her harp into its place.]
DRELLA: Oh, that is a great spot for a table. Decorator's a genius.
[Lorelai walks back to the front desk where Michel is still on the phone]
MICHEL: Madame, you have no idea how desperately I'd like to help, but see, I'd have to build a room for you myself, and I am not a man who works with his hands, so the best I can do is suggest that you please, please try for another weekend. Any weekend. [pause] Ah, good, fine, the twenty-first. Hold on, I'll look. [Michel leafs through the reservation book] No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked. [Michel looks at the phone, as apparently the woman has hung up on him]
LORELAI: Has the plumber attended to room four yet?
MICHEL: He was here, he did nothing, it's a hundred dollars.
[Lorelai picks up the phone and dials a number.]
LORELAI: Hi Marco, Lorelai. Talk to me about room four. What was wrong with it?
[Rory comes in. Lorelai kisses her hello.]
LORELAI: [on phone] Uh huh. I thought you replaced that already. [pause] Well, because you told me you did and I never forget anything, so this one's on you, right? [pause] Pleasure doing business with you. [hangs up]
MICHEL: What is your offspring doing?
RORY: I need stamps. Can I have these?
MICHEL: No.
LORELAI: Take them. What's with the muumuu? [gestures to Rory's baggy sweater.]
RORY: Stop.
LORELAI: No, I'm just saying, you couldn't find one made of metal in case anyone has X-ray eyes?
RORY: And now we say goodbye.
LORELAI: Ooh, hey, have Michel look at your French paper before you go.
MICHEL: Excuse me?
RORY: That'd be great.
MICHEL: No.
RORY: Come on, Michel. I'll tell all the ladies what a stud you are.
MICHEL: Hm. I believe that memo has already been sent.
LORELAI: [in a French accent] Oh, please, Michel. Pretty please with sucre on top. I will stop talking like this.
MICHEL: Leave it. I'll look at it if I get a chance.
RORY: It's due tomorrow. And pay special attention to the grammar.
[Rory leaves. Lorelai stares at Michel.]
MICHEL: I despise you.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Rory and Lane are walking to school. Lane puts a Woodstock '99 shirt on over the shirt she left home in.]
RORY: When are you going to let your parents know that you listen to the evil rock music? You're an American teenager, for God's sake.
LANE: Rory, if my parents still get upset over the obscene portion size of American food, I seriously doubt I'm gonna make any inroads with Eminem.
[The girls stop by a sign that says "Teen Hayride" so Lane can put on her jacket.]
LANE: [points to sign] I have to go to that.
RORY: The hayride? You're kidding.
LANE: My parents set me up with the son of a business associate. He's gonna be a doctor.
RORY: How old is he?
LANE: Sixteen.
RORY: So he's gonna be a doctor in a hundred years.
LANE: Well, my parents like to plan ahead.
RORY: God, you have to go to the hayride with him?
LANE: And his older brother.
RORY: Oh, now you're kidding.
LANE: Koreans never joke about future doctors. So, I guess you're not going, huh?
RORY: No, I'm still fuzzy on what's fun about sitting in the cold for two hours with a bundle of sticks up your butt.
LANE: Don't expect me to clear it up for you.
[Lane and Rory have arrived at school. They walk inside as a guy standing on the steps watches them.]
CUT TO CLASSROOM
MRS. TRAISTER: For those of you who have not finished the final chapters of Huckleberry Finn you may use this time to do so. For those of you who have, you can start on your essay now. Whichever task you choose, do it silently.
[The girls around Rory pass a bottle of nail polish back and forth as Rory concentrates on writing in her notebook.]
GIRL #1: Maybe it's a love letter.
GIRL #2: Or her diary.
GIRL #3: Could be a slam book.
[Girl #4 peers over Rory's shoulder.]
GIRL #4: It's the assignment.
[The girls turn away, Rory smiles to herself.]
CUT TO THE INDEPENDENCE INN
[Drella is playing the harp. A woman stands nearby and listens.]
DRELLA: Nice, huh?
WOMAN: Beautiful.
DRELLA: Yeah, well, tell it to the tip jar.
[Lorelai and a bellboy are crossing the lobby.]
LORELAI: Take Mrs. Langworthy's bags up to 314. Make sure the drapes are closed and there's extra soap and she wants her pillow mints now.
[There's a crash from the kitchen. Lorelai rushes in.]
LORELAI: Sookie!
[Sookie is on the floor near the stove.]
SOOKIE: I'm okay, I'm okay.
LORELAI: What did you do now? [to Salvador] Oh, why aren't you watching her? No estabas cuidandola?
SALVADOR: Eh, no, she's this - bad food in the head.
LORELAI: Oh. [to Sookie] I need you to be more careful.
SOOKIE: I know, I'm sorry. Hey, I fixed the peach sauce.
LORELAI: That's blood, you're bleeding. Why are you bleeding?
SOOKIE: Oh, my stitches opened. I was using too much maple syrup. It strangled the fruit.
LORELAI: When did you get stitches?
SOOKIE: Friday night. Radish roses.
LORELAI: Okay, stop moving.
SOOKIE: You gotta taste the sauce. You have to try it while it's still warm.
LORELAI: Okay. Oh, Sookie, I need you to be more careful. I need there to be fewer accidents.
SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Sookie feeds Lorelai a spoonful of the sauce.]
LORELAI: Oh, dear God Almighty. That's incredible!
SOOKIE: I want to put it on the waffles tomorrow morning for breakfast.
LORELAI: I want to take a bath in that sauce!
SOOKIE: I will make more!
LORELAI: Someday when we open our own inn, diabetics will line up to eat this sauce.
SOOKIE: Won't that be great?
LORELAI: Yeah. But the key to someday achieving that dream is for you to stay alive long enough so we can actually open an inn, you understand?
SOOKIE: Yes, I understand.
LORELAI: All right. So, now, let's get you up and to the doctor, on three. One-two-three.
SOOKIE: Ow!
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Stepped on my thumb. I'm fine. On three. Okay.
[Lorelai and Salvador help Sookie up.]
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lane and Rory are walking home from school.]
LANE: Well, was it a good color at least?
RORY: It had sparkles in it.
LANE: Wow.
RORY: And it smelled like bubble gum when it dried.
LANE: Oh, well, there's no way Mark Twain can compete with that.
[Lane and Rory walk into Kim's Antiques.]
LANE: [calls] Mom, we're home. [to Rory] Did you hear something?
RORY: I'm not sure.
LANE: [calls] Mom? Are you here?
MRS. KIM: [from another room] We're open! Everything's half off!
RORY: We have contact.
LANE: [calls] Mom?
MRS. KIM: [calls] Lane?
LANE: Mom?
MRS. KIM: Lane?
[Lane and Mrs. Kim call to each other as Lane and Rory walk around the cluttered store trying to follow the sound of Mrs. Kim's voice.]
LANE: Mom, where are you?
MRS. KIM: Lane, where are you?
LANE: Back here!
MRS. KIM: Over here!
RORY: I think she's that way.
LANE: Are we closer?
MRS. KIM: I'm by the table!
RORY: She's kidding, right?
LANE: Look, we'll meet you in the kitchen!
MRS. KIM: What?
RORY: The kitchen!
MRS. KIM: Who's that?
LANE: It's Rory, Mom.
MRS. KIM: Oh.
RORY: Wow, I can hear the disappointment from here.
LANE: Oh, come on. Stop it.
RORY: You know, it sucks that after all these years your mom still hates me.
LANE: She doesn't hate you.
RORY: She hates my mother.
LANE: She doesn't trust unmarried women.
RORY: You're unmarried.
LANE: I'm hayriding with a future proctologist. I have potential.
[Lane and Rory wind their way through the antique furniture and come out in the kitchen where Mrs. Kim is waiting.]
MRS. KIM: Go upstairs. Tea is ready. I have muffins - no dairy, no sugar, no wheat. You have to soak them in tea to make them soft enough to bite but they're very healthy. So, how was school? None of the girls get pregnant, drop out?
LANE: Not that we know of.
RORY: Though come to think of it, Joanna Posner was glowing a little.
MRS. KIM: What?
LANE: Nothing, Mama. She's just kidding.
MRS. KIM: [very seriously] Boys don't like funny girls.
RORY: Noted.
[A bell rings, signaling that someone has just opened the shop door.]
MAN: [calls] Hello? Anybody here?
MRS. KIM: [calls] We're here! We're coming! [to the girls] Have the muffins. Made from sprouted wheat. Only good 24 hours. [calls] Everything's half off!
MAN: [calls] Where are you?
MRS. KIM: [calls] Over here!
MAN: [calls] Where?
MRS. KIM: [calls] By the chair!
MAN: [calls] What chair?
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[Sookie is chopping vegetables. Salvador pulls Sookie's hand away from the cutting board]
SALVADOR: Careful!
SOOKIE: I'm okay. Peppers, peppers, peppers.
SALVADOR: Mike!
[As Sookie moves around the kitchen the other cooks move things out of her way and prevent disasters.]
SOOKIE: Okay, hello little vegetables, come with me. I got it. Okay, where's my glaze.
SALVADOR: In the counter.
SOOKIE: On the counter. On, not in, not in the counter. Okay, good, all right. My sauce. Whoo, that's pretty good. Hello, a little bit of greens. Okay, okay. Hello, my little babies. You like that? A little bit of juice. Okay. You're very pretty. Okay.
SALVADOR: Mike, Mike!
[Mike helps Sookie reach an iron k*ll; Lorelai rushes into the kitchen]
LORELAI: Sookie!
[Sookie turns around and lifts the hand with the k*ll. She hits Salvador in the face with it and knocks him over. ]
LORELAI: Ooh. It's here! It happened! She did it!
SOOKIE: Okay, I'm gonna need a little bit longer sentence.
LORELAI: The Chilton school. Rory got in.
SOOKIE: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
LORELAI: I know. Look. [reads from a letter] "Dear Ms. Gilmore, We are happy to inform you that we have a vacancy at Chilton Preparatory starting immediately. Due to your daughter's excellent credentials and your enthusiastic pursuit of her enrollment" - I offered to do the principal to get her in - "we would be happy to accept her as soon as the first semester's tuition has been received."
SOOKIE: This is very exciting!
[They both giggle and hug]
LORELAI: Is something burning?
SOOKIE: My bangs, earlier. Go on, go on, go on.
LORELAI: This is it. She can finally go to Harvard like she's always wanted and get the education that I never got and get to do all the things that I never got to do and then I can resent her for it and we can finally have a normal mother-daughter relationship.
SOOKIE: Oh, good.
[They giggle again. Rory walks in]
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: Oh!
RORY: You're happy.
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: Did you do something slutty?
LORELAI: I'm not that happy.
[Lorelai and Sookie giggle.]
LORELAI: Here. [hands Rory a gift bag.]
RORY: What's going on?
LORELAI: Open it.
[Rory pulls out a plaid skirt.]
RORY: I'm gonna be in a Britney Spears video?
SOOKIE: You're going to Chilton! Oh, sorry.
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: You did it, babe. You got in.
RORY: How did this happen? You didn't. . .with the principal, did you?
LORELAI: No, honey, that was a joke. They have an open spot. You're gonna start on Monday.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Really.
RORY: I don't believe this! Oh my God, I'm going to Chilton!
LORELAI: Yeah.
[Lorelai and Rory hug.]
RORY: Sookie, I'm going to Chilton!
[Sookie and Rory hug.]
SOOKIE: I'll make cookies. Protestants love oatmeal.
RORY: I have to call Lane.
[Rory starts to leave then hugs Lorelai again.]
RORY: I love you.
LORELAI: I love you.
[Rory leaves.]
LORELAI: My girl's going to Chilton
SOOKIE: Yeah. Rory's going to Chilton!
[As Lorelai leaves, Sookie starts a little dance and begins to sing.]
SOOKIE: Rory's going to Chilton! Rory's going to Chilton! Rory's going to Chilton!
[Sookie tosses a dish towel over her shoulder. It lands on the stove and catches fire. Salvador covers it with a lid.]
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN LOBBY
[The phone is ringing, Michel is ignoring it.]
LORELAI: Michel, the phone.
MICHEL: Mmhmm. It rings.
LORELAI: Can you answer it?
MICHEL: No. People are particularly stupid today. I can't talk to any more of them.
LORELAI: You know who's really nice to talk to? The people at the unemployment agency.
[Michel answers the phone.]
MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. [pause] No, I'm sorry, we're completely booked.
[Lorelai opens an envelope and pulls out a letter. She reads it and gasps]
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Lorelai is walking around while on the phone.]
LORELAI: I'm holding for Miss Bell. I've been trying to get a hold of her all day. [pause] Lorelai Gilmore. [pause] Hi! Oh, hi, hi. Yeah, uh, my daughter Rory has just been accepted - yay. [pause] Thank you, and, um, I got the invoice for your enrollment fee. Wow, that is a lot of zeros behind that five. [pause] Uh huh. Okay, well, I guess what I'm wondering is if you couldn't take, say, part of it now, just to get her going? [pause] Well, but she's supposed to start Monday. It just doesn't give me a lot of time to pull a bank job. [pause] Well, never mind, I was just kidding. [pause] No, a bank job is robbing a bank but -- [pause] Uh-huh. Oh, no. No, no, no. I don't want you to give up her space. I'll just -- I'll have to figure it out. [pause] Okay. No, thank you. It's been a real treat talking to you. [pause] Yeah. Bye-bye.
CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT PORCH
[It's nighttime. Lorelai and Sookie are talking on the porch.]
LORELAI: What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
SOOKIE: You can have anything I own. My car! Sell my car.
LORELAI: Oh, sweetie, no one wants your car.
SOOKIE: Yeah.
LORELAI: There's something I haven't thought of, I know there is. There's something out there staring me right in the face. I just. . .I haven't seen it.
SOOKIE: You know, you might consider calling your par--
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: But I don't think you have a --
LORELAI: Stop.
SOOKIE: You can at least go and --
LORELAI: Uh.
SOOKIE: Okay, can I say one more thing? I think it's your only option.
LORELAI: Sookie, there are several chapters from a Stephen King novel I'd reenact before I'd resort to that option.
SOOKIE: Okay, dropped. Dropped.
LORELAI: Thank you.
[Rory comes outside in her Chilton skirt, which is too big on her.]
RORY: Mom? So what do you think?
SOOKIE: [enthusiastically] Wow, it makes you look smart!
RORY: Okay, no more wine for you. Mom?
LORELAI: You look like you were swallowed by a kilt.
RORY: Fine, you can hem it. A little.
LORELAI: Ooh.
RORY: Only a little.
LORELAI: Okay. Or I could hem it a lot.
RORY: No, you're not. I don't want it to be too short.
[They all walk inside.]
RORY: I can't believe tomorrow's my last day at Stars Hollow High.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Today I was so excited I dressed for gym.
LORELAI: You're kidding!
RORY: And I played volleyball.
LORELAI: With other people?
RORY: And I learned that all this time I was avoiding group sports?
LORELAI: Yeah?
RORY: Was very smart because I suck at them.
[Lorelai begins to pin up the skirt.]
LORELAI: Well, yeah, you got that from me.
SOOKIE: Where's your paté?
LORELAI: At Zsa Zsa Gabor's house.
SOOKIE: Right. I'm going to the store because you have nothing. You feel like duck?
LORELAI: Ooh, if it's made with chicken, absolutely.
SOOKIE: I'll be back.
LORELAI: Bye.
[Sookie leaves.]
LORELAI: All right. This will give you an idea. Go see how you like it.
RORY: Okay. I love being a private school girl.
[Rory heads to her bedroom to check her skirt. Lorelai stares at pictures on the mantle.]
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai sits on the runner of her Jeep outside a large, imposing house]
[Cut to the door opening from the inside of the house. Lorelai is standing on the porch.]
LORELAI: Hi, Mom.
EMILY: Lorelai, my goodness, this is a surprise. Is it Easter already?
LORELAI: [laughs nervously] No, I just, uh, finished up my business class and I thought I would stop by.
EMILY: To see me?
LORELAI: Yes.
EMILY: Well, isn't that nice. Come in.
LORELAI: Thanks.
[She walks inside and they walk to the living room]
LORELAI: The place looks great.
EMILY: It hasn't changed.
LORELAI: Well, there you go. How are the girls at the bridge club?
EMILY: Old.
LORELAI: Well...good.
[Emily and Lorelai take seats opposite each other.]
EMILY: You said you were taking a business class?
LORELAI: Yeah, mmhmm, yeah. I'm taking a business class at the college twice a week. I'm sure I told you.
EMILY: Well, if you're sure then you must have. [long silence] Would you like some tea?
LORELAI: I would love some coffee.
RICHARD: [calls from another room] Emily? I'm home.
EMILY: We're in here.
[Richard enters the room]
LORELAI: Hi, Dad.
RICHARD: What is it, Christmas already?
EMILY: Lorelai was taking a business class at the college today and decided to drop in to see us.
RICHARD: What business class?
EMILY: Well, she told us about it, dear, remember?
RICHARD: No.
LORELAI: Well, actually, I came here for a reason. Dad, would you mind sitting down for a minute?
RICHARD: You need money.
LORELAI: I have a situation.
RICHARD: You need money.
LORELAI: Dad, will you just please let me get this out, okay? Um, Rory has been accepted to Chilton.
EMILY: Chilton? Oh, that's a wonderful school. It's only five minutes from here.
LORELAI: That's right, it is. She can start as early as Monday. Um, the problem is that they want me to put down an enrollment fee plus the first semester's tuition, and I have to do that immediately or she loses her spot.
RICHARD: So, you need money.
LORELAI: Yeah. But it's not for me, it's for Rory. And I fully intend to pay you back every cent. I don't ask for favors, you know that.
EMILY: Oh, yes, we know.
RICHARD: I'll get the checkbook.
LORELAI: Thank you. You have no idea. Thank you.
EMILY: On one condition.
LORELAI: [mumbles to herself] So close.
EMILY: Since we are now financially involved in your life, I want to be actively involved in your life.
LORELAI: What does that mean, Mother?
EMILY: I want a weekly dinner.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Friday nights, you and Rory will have dinner here.
LORELAI: Mom...
EMILY: And you have to call us once a week to give us an update on her schooling and your life. That's it. That's the condition. If you agree, you'll come to dinner tomorrow night and leave here with a check. Otherwise, I'm sorry, we can't help you.
LORELAI: I don't want her to know that I borrowed money from you. Can that just be between us?
EMILY: Does seven o'clock work for you?
LORELAI: [with a forced smile] Perfect.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW HIGH
[Rory is cleaning out her locker with Lane.]
RORY: And we get to wear uniforms. No more having people check you out to see what jeans you're wearing 'cause everyone's dressed alike in boring clothes and just there to learn.
LANE: Okay, there's academic-minded and then there's Amish.
[They start walking down the hallway. Rory is carrying a box full of books and papers.]
RORY: Funny.
LANE: Thank you! So I told my mom you're changing schools.
RORY: Was she thrilled?
LANE: The party's on Friday. I gotta go. I have to have a pre-hayride cup of tea with a future doctor. How do I look? Korean?
RORY: Spitting image.
LANE: Good. Bye.
RORY: Bye.
[Lane leaves. Rory drops a book and some papers. As she bends down to pick them up, she turns and sees a guy standing right beside her. It's the same guy who watched her and Lane walk into the school a few days earlier.]
RORY: God! You're like Ruth Gordon just standing there with a tannis root. Make a noise.
DEAN: Rosemary's Baby.
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: Well, that's a great movie. You've got good taste. [silence] Are you moving?
RORY: No, just my books are.
DEAN: My family just moved here from Chicago.
RORY: Chicago. Windy. Oprah.
DEAN: Yeah. Yeah, that's the place. I'm Dean.
RORY: Hi. [silence] Oh, Rory. Me. That's -- that's me.
DEAN: Rory.
RORY: Well, Lorelai technically.
DEAN: Lorelai. I like that.
RORY: It's my mother's name, too. She named me after herself. She was lying in the hospital thinking about how men name boys after themselves all the time, you know, so why couldn't women? She says her feminism just kind of took over. Though personally I think a lot of Demerol also went into that decision. I never talk this much.
DEAN: Well, I better go.
RORY: Oh, sure.
DEAN: I have to go look for a job.
RORY: Okay, good.
[Dean starts to leave.]
RORY: You should check with Miss Patty.
DEAN: [turns back] What?
RORY: About the job. You should check with Miss Patty. She teaches dance. She was actually on Broadway once.
DEAN: I. . .I don't really dance much.
RORY: No, no, she just kind of knows everything that's going on in town. She'll know if someone's looking.
DEAN: Oh, great. Uh, thanks. Hey, what are you doing now?
RORY: Nothing...much. I should throw this away at some point.
DEAN: Well, maybe you could show me where this Miss Patty's place is.
RORY: Yeah, I guess so. I really don't have anything important to. . .let's go.
[They walk out of the school and down the street. Dean carries Rory's box of books for her.]
DEAN: So, have you lived here all your life?
RORY: Yes. Well, pretty much. I was actually born in Hartford.
DEAN: Well, that's not far.
RORY: Thirty minutes with no traffic.
DEAN: Really?
RORY: I timed it.
DEAN: Okay, then.
[They walk past the bakery]
RORY: So, do you like cake?
DEAN: What?
RORY: They make really good cakes here. They're very...round.
DEAN: Okay, I'll remember that.
RORY: Good. Make a note. You wouldn't want to forget where the round cakes are.
DEAN: So, how are you liking Moby Dick?
RORY: Oh, it's really good.
DEAN: Yeah?
RORY: Yeah, it's my first Melville.
DEAN: Cool.
RORY: I mean, I know it's kind of cliché to pick Moby Dick as your first Melville but. . .hey, how did you know I was reading Moby Dick?
DEAN: Uh, well, I've been watching you.
RORY: Watching me?
DEAN: I mean, not in a creepy, like, "I'm watching you" sort of way. I just -- I've noticed you.
RORY: Me?
DEAN: Yeah.
RORY: When?
DEAN: Every day. After school you come out and you sit under that tree there and you read. Last week it was Madame Bovary. This week it's Moby Dick.
RORY: But why would you --
DEAN: Because you're nice to look at, and because you've got unbelievable concentration.
RORY: What?
DEAN: Last Friday these two guys were tossing around a ball and one guy nailed the other right in the face. I mean, it was a mess, blood everywhere, the nurse came out, the place was in chaos, his girlfriend was all freaking out, and you just sat there and read. I mean, you never even looked up. I thought, "I have never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life. I have to meet that girl."
RORY: Maybe I just didn't look up because I'm unbelievably self-centered.
DEAN: Maybe, but I doubt it.
[They smile at each other.]
RORY: So, did I ask if you like cake?
DEAN: Yeah, you did.
RORY: Oh. 'Cause they have really good cake back there.



CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
[Rory and Lorelai are sitting quietly at a table.]
LORELAI: So, you were late getting home tonight.
RORY: Yeah, I went to the library.
LORELAI: Oh. Oh, I forgot to tell you, we're having dinner with your grandparents tomorrow night.
RORY: We are?
LORELAI: Mmhmm.
RORY: But it's September.
LORELAI: So?
RORY: So what holiday's in September?
LORELAI: Look, it's not a holiday thing. It's just dinner, okay?
RORY: Fine, sorry.
[Luke brings their main courses to the table.]
LUKE: Red meat can k*ll you. Enjoy. [leaves]
LORELAI: So, I finished hemming your skirt today. [no answer] A grunt of acknowledgment might be nice.
RORY: I don't understand why we're going to dinner tomorrow night. I mean, what if I had plans? You didn't even ask me.
LORELAI: Well, if you had plans I would have known.
RORY: How?
LORELAI: Well, you would have told me.
RORY: I don't tell you everything. I have my own things.
LORELAI: Fine, you have things.
RORY: That's right. I have things.
LORELAI: Hey, I had dibs on being the bitch tonight.
RORY: Just tonight?
LORELAI: What the hell is wrong with you?
RORY: I'm not sure I want to go to Chilton.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: The timing is just really bad.
LORELAI: The timing is bad?
RORY: And the bus ride to and from Hartford, it's like thirty minutes each way.
LORELAI: I can't believe what I'm hearing.
RORY: Plus, I don't think we should be spending that money right now. I mean, I know Chilton's got to be costing you a lot.
LORELAI: Oh, you have no idea.
RORY: All of your money should be going toward buying an inn with Sookie.
LORELAI: What about college? What about Harvard?
RORY: We don't know that I can't get into Harvard if I stay where I am.
LORELAI: Okay, enough. Enough of the crazy talk, okay? I appreciate your concern but I have this covered.
RORY: I still don't want to go.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Because I don't.
LORELAI: I have to get out of here.
[Lorelai stands up and starts to leave.]
RORY: We have to pay first.
[Lorelai drops some money on the table. They walk out of the diner and start walking down the street. The hayride wagon passes by them, with a glum Lane sandwiched between two Korean boys on the back. Miss Patty stands in the doorway of her dance studio watching over a class of little girls.]
MISS PATTY: One-two-three. One-two-three. One-two-three. It's a waltz, ladies. Susie, do you have to tinkle? Then uncross your legs, darling. [sees Rory] Oh, Rory, good. I think I found a job for your male friend.
LORELAI: What male friend?
MISS PATTY: They need a stock boy at the supermarket. I already talked to Taylor Doose about him. You just send him around tomorrow.
RORY: Okay, thanks.
LORELAI: What male friend?
MISS PATTY: Oh ,he's very cute. You have good taste.
[Miss Patty turns back to her dance class.]
MISS PATTY: Hands in the air, not in the nose.
[Rory starts walking quickly down the street, and Lorelai follows her.]
LORELAI: Oh, you're gonna have to walk faster than that. You're gonna have to turn into friggin' Flo Jo to get away from me.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
[Rory enters and slams the front door. Lorelai follows her inside.]
LORELAI: This is about a boy, of course. I can't believe I didn't see it. All this talk about money and bus rides. You got a thing going with a guy and you don't want to leave school.
RORY: I'm going to bed.
LORELAI: God, I'm so dense. That should have been my first thought. After all, you're me.
RORY: I'm not you.
LORELAI: Really? Someone willing to throw important life experiences out the window to be with a guy. It sounds like me to me.
RORY: Whatever.
LORELAI: So who is he?
RORY: There's no guy!
LORELAI: Dark hair, romantic eyes? Looks a little dangerous?
RORY: This conversation is over.
LORELAI: Tattoos are good, too!
RORY: I don't want to change schools because of all the reasons I've already told you a thousand times. If you don't want to believe me, that's fine. Goodnight. [goes to her bedroom]
LORELAI: Does he have a motorcycle? 'Cause if you're gonna throw your life away, he better have a motorcycle!
[Lorelai walks into Rory's bedroom]
LORELAI: Well, I think that went pretty well, don't you?
RORY: Thanks for the knock.
LORELAI: Listen, can we just start all over, okay? You tell me all about the guy and I promise not to let my head explode, huh? Rory, please talk to me. [silence] Okay, I'll talk. Don't get me wrong. Guys are great. I am a huge fan of guys. You don't get knocked up at sixteen being indifferent to guys. But, babe, guys are always going to be there. This school isn't. It's more important. It has to be more important.
RORY: I'm going to sleep.
LORELAI: Rory. You've always been the sensible one in this house, huh? I need you to remember that feeling now. You will kick your own butt later if you blow this.
RORY: Well, it's my butt.
LORELAI: Good comeback.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome. Rory, come on.
RORY: I don't want to talk about this. Could you please, please just leave me alone?
LORELAI: Okay, fine. We always had a democracy in this house. We never did anything unless we both agreed. But now I guess I'm going to have to play the mom card. You are going to Chilton whether you want to or not. Monday morning, you will be there, end of story.
RORY: We'll see.
LORELAI: Yeah, we will.
[Lorelai slams the door on her way out. Rory turns on her CD player. Macy Gray's I Try plays. Lorelai goes to the living room and turns on the same song.]
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
[There is smoke coming out of the broken stove as some workers start to remove it. Sookie sits sadly at the counter.]
SOOKIE: I swear I don't know what happened.
LORELAI: It's not important.
SOOKIE: I made that dish a hundred times. It never exploded.
LORELAI: Please, forget it.
SOOKIE: Oh, God, I k*ll a Viking. Oh, you should fire me, or make me pay the cost of a new stove out of my paycheck.
LORELAI: Well, whatever you want.
SOOKIE: I can't afford a new stove! Those things are expensive.
LORELAI: Sookie, please, I am begging you, pull yourself together, okay? I got no sleep last night and I think I put my contacts in backwards.
SOOKIE: Rory's still mad at you, huh?
LORELAI: Hey, I'm not so crazy about her either.
SOOKIE: It was a fight. Mothers and daughters fight.
LORELAI: No, we don't fight. We never fight.
[Michel walks in]
MICHEL: You told me to tell you when your daughter arrived. Well, she's here and she's sitting in my chair.
LORELAI: [to Sookie] Hold on just a minute.
[Lorelai leaves]
MICHEL: And you are the one left standing. That is a funny, funny thing, no?
[In the lobby, Lorelai walks up to Rory at the front desk]
LORELAI: Hey, no muumuu today. You know what's weird, I kind of miss it.
RORY: You left me a note to meet you here.
LORELAI: Yeah, I thought you might want to work a couple hours, make a little extra cash.
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Aw, you're not gonna give me the "Mommy Dearest" treatment forever, are ya?
RORY: You wanted me here, I'm here. Should I do something or what?
LORELAI: Yeah, go home. Dinner's at seven. Be ready to go.
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Fine.
[Rory leaves. Michel walks over and sits in his chair.]
MICHEL: Ah, my chair.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
[Lorelai and Rory stand on the front porch staring at the door]
RORY: So, do we go in or do we just stand here reenacting The Little Match Girl?
LORELAI: Okay, look, I know you and me are having a thing here and I know you hate me but I need you to be civil, at least through dinner and then on the way home you can pull a Menendez. Deal?
RORY: Fine.
[Lorelai rings the doorbell. Emily opens the door.]
RORY: Hi, Grandma.
EMILY: Well, you're right on time.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah, no traffic at all.
[they walk inside]
EMILY: I can't tell you what a treat it is to have you girls here.
LORELAI: Oh, well, we're excited, too.
EMILY: Is that a collector's cup or can I throw it away for you?
LORELAI: Oh.
[Lorelai starts to toss her empty coffee cup into a nearby wastebasket.]
EMILY: In the kitchen, please. [to Rory] So, I want to hear all about Chilton.
RORY: Well, I haven't actually started yet.
[As Rory and Emily walk away, Lorelai drops the cup into the wastebasket. Cut to the living room, where Richard is reading a newspaper. Rory and Emily walk in]
EMILY: Richard, look who's here.
RICHARD: Rory. You're tall.
RORY: I guess.
RICHARD: Well, what's your height?
RORY: 5'7".
RICHARD: That's tall. She's tall.
[Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Hi, Dad.
RICHARD: Lorelai, your daughter's tall.
LORELAI: Oh, I know. It's freakish. We're thinking of having her studied at M.I.T.
RICHARD: Ah. [he returns to reading his paper.]
EMILY: Champagne, anyone?
LORELAI: Oh, that's fancy.
EMILY: Well, it's not every day that I have my girls here for dinner on a day the banks are open. A toast - to Rory entering Chilton and an exciting new phase in her life.
RICHARD: Here, here.
EMILY: Mmm. Well, let's sit everyone. This is just wonderful. An education is the most important thing in the world, next to family.
LORELAI: And pie. [silence] Joke, joke.
EMILY: Ah.
[There is a long silence. Richard hands Rory a section of the newspaper.]
CUT TO THE DINING ROOM
[Later that night, they're all sitting at the table eating dinner]
EMILY: Rory, how do you like the lamb?
RORY: It's good.
EMILY: Too dry?
RORY: No, it's perfect.
LORELAI: Potatoes could use a little salt, though.
EMILY: Excuse me?
RORY: So, Grandpa, how's the insurance biz?
RICHARD: Oh, people die, we pay. People crash cars, we pay. People lose a foot, we pay.
LORELAI: Well, at least you have your new slogan.
RICHARD: And how are things at the motel?
LORELAI: The inn? They're great.
EMILY: Lorelai's the executive manager now. Isn't that wonderful?
RICHARD: Speaking of which, Christopher called yesterday.
LORELAI: Speaking of which? How is that a speaking of which?
RICHARD: He's doing very well in California. His Internet start-up goes public next month. This could mean big things for him. [to Rory] Very talented man, your father.
LORELAI: She knows.
RICHARD: He always was a smart one, that boy. [to Rory] You must take after him.
LORELAI: Speaking of which, I'm gonna get a Coke. Or a knife.
[Lorelai storms out of the room. She goes into the kitchen and starts scrubbing a dish in the sink. The maid comes in and looks at her.]
LORELAI: Hi, how are you doing?
[Back at the dinner table, Rory starts to get up.]
RORY: I think I'm gonna go talk to her -
EMILY: No, I'll go. You stay and keep your grandfather company.
[Emily enters the kitchen.]
EMILY: Lorelai, come back to the table.
LORELAI: Is this what it's gonna be like every Friday night? I come over and let the two of you attack me?
EMILY: You're being very dramatic.
LORELAI: Dramatic? Were you at that table just now?
EMILY: Yes, I was, and I think you took what your father said the wrong way.
LORELAI: The wrong way? How could I have taken it the wrong way? What was open to interpretation?
[Richard and Rory are able to overhear Lorelai and Emily arguing.]
EMILY: Keep your voice down.
LORELAI: No, Mother. I can't take it anymore. Tonight just seems like a nightmare.
EMILY: You're dripping all over the floor.
LORLEAI: Why do you pounce on every single thing I say?
EMILY: That's absurd. You barely uttered a word all night.
LORELAI: That's not true.
EMILY: You said pie.
LORELAI: Oh, come on.
EMILY: You did. All I heard you say was pie.
LORELAI: Why would he bring up Christopher? Was that really necessary?
EMILY: He likes Christopher.
LORELAI: Isn't that interesting? Because, as I remember, when Christopher got me pregnant, Dad didn't like him so much.
EMILY: Oh, well, please, you were sixteen. What were we supposed to do - throw you a party? We were disappointed. The two of you had such bright futures.
LORELAI: Yes. And by not getting married we got to keep those bright futures.
EMILY: When you get pregnant, you get married. A child needs a mother and a father.
LORELAI: Oh, Mom. Do you think that Christopher would have his own company right now if we'd gotten married? Do you think he would be anything at all?
EMILY: Yes, I do. Your father would have put him in the insurance business and you'd be living a lovely life right now.
LORELAI: He didn't want to be in the insurance business and I am living a lovely life right now.
EMILY: That's right, far away from us.
LORELAI: Oh, here we go.
EMILY: You took that girl and completely shut us out of your life.
LORELAI: You wanted to control me.
EMILY: You were still a child.
LORELAI: I stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink, okay? I had to figure out how to live. I found a good job.
EMILY: As a maid. With all your brains and talent.
LORELAI: I worked my way up. I run the place now. I built a life on my own with no help from anyone.
EMILY: Yes, and think of where you would have been if you'd accepted a little help, hmm? And where Rory would have been. But no, you were always too proud to accept anything from anyone.
LORELAI: Well, I wasn't too proud to come here to you two begging for money for my kid's school, was I?
[Rory overhears this]
EMILY: No, you certainly weren't. But you're too proud to let her know where you got it from, aren't you? Well, fine, you have your precious pride and I have my weekly dinners. Isn't that nice? We both win.
[Back at the table, Richard is asleep in his chair.]
CUT TO OUTSIDE
[Lorelai and Rory walk out of the house. Lorelai sighs and leans against the outside wall.]
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: I'm okay. I just. . .do I look shorter? 'Cause I feel shorter.
RORY: Hey, how 'bout I buy you a cup of coffee?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. You drive, though, okay, 'cause I don't think my feet will reach the pedals.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
[Lorelai and Rory walk toward Luke's Diner]
RORY: So, nice dinner at the grandparents' house.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, her dishes have never been cleaner.
RORY: You and Grandma seemed to have a nice talk.
LORELAI: How much did you hear?
RORY: Not much. You know, snippets.
LORELAI: Snippets?
RORY: Little snippets.
LORELAI: So basically everything?
RORY: Basically, yes.
LORELAI: Well, the best laid plans.
[They walk into the diner and sit at a table]
RORY: I think it was really brave of you to ask them for money.
LORELAI: Oh, I so do not want to talk about it.
RORY: How many meals is it gonna take 'til we're off the hook?
LORELAI: I think the deli spread at my funeral will be the last one. Hey, wait, does that mean
RORY: Can't let a perfectly good plaid skirt go to waste.
LORELAI: Oh, honey, you won't be sorry.
[Luke walks up to the table dressed in a button-down shirt]
LORELAI: Wow, you look nice. Really nice.
LUKE: I had a meeting earlier at the bank. They like collars. You look nice, too.
LORELAI: I had a flagellation to go to.
LUKE: So, what'll you have?
LORELAI: Coffee, in a vat.
RORY: I'll have coffee also. And chili fries.
LUKE: That's quite a refined palate you got there.
[Luke walks away]
LORELAI: Behold the healing powers of a bath. So, tell me about the guy.
RORY: You know what's really special about our relationship? The total understanding about the need for one's privacy. I mean, you really understand boundaries.
LORELAI: So tell me about the guy.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Is he dreamy?
RORY: Oh, that's so Nick at Night.
LORELAI: Well, I'm gonna find out anyway.
RORY: Really? How?
LORELAI: I'll spy.
[Luke returns with their order]
LUKE: Coffee. . .fries. I can't stand it. This is so unhealthy. Rory, please, put down that cup of coffee. You do not want to grow up to be like your mom.
RORY: Sorry, too late.
[Rory and Lorelai smile at each other. Luke walks away.]
LORELAI: So tell me about the guy.
RORY: Check, please.
LORELAI: No, really, are you embarrassed to bring him home?
RORY: I'm not embarrassed.
LORELAI: Does he talk at all?
RORY: No, Mom, he's a mime.

The Lorelai's First Day at Chilton
Transcribed by Jeannette Haworth
(Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the couch on the porch in front of the house. Lorelai is painting Rory's toenails red. Rory squirts whipped cream into her mouth.)
Lorelai : (sarcastically) That's nice.
Rory : Thank you.
L : Don't move, please.
R : So, Why are you insisting on doing this.
L : Well, because you're going to be starting private school tomorrow.
R : Yes, but I'm going to be wearing shoes. Nobody's going to see my feet.
L : Okay, But everybody knows that private school girls are bad. And bad girls always wear red nail polish.
(There is a lull in the conversation.)
L : Are you nervous?
R : About what?
L : About starting Chilton.
R : Well I wasn't until I heard about all those bad girls.
(They both laugh.)
(Lane Kim, Rory's friend runs up.)
Lane : You guys! XTC. Apple Venus Volume 2.
(Lorelai and Lane run into the house.)
R : But you only finished half my toes!
L : Who cares?! You're going to be wearing shoes anyway!
(Rory rolls her eyes and goes into the house.)
(Opening Sequence Starts.)
(Commercials)
(Shows an opening sh*t of the house.)
(Lorelai is sleeping. Rory, dressed in her Chilton clothes, opens the door to her mom's bedroom.)
R : Mom!
L : (gasps) What? God! Hi. (in a whiny tone)
R : What are you doing?
L : Having a heart attack.
R : I thought you were up. It's 7:10!
L : What?
R : It's 7:10.
(Rory grabs her pillow.)
L : Stop it! It's a quarter to six. (grabs back pillow)
R : No it's not!
L : Yes it is! I set the clock for a quarter to six so it's..
(Rory grabs clock and shows her the time.)
L : It's 7:10!
(Lorelai jumps out of bed and stumbles around, disoriented. Rory slams down clock.)
R : I can't be late on my first day of school. Do you know what happens to people when they're late on their first day?
(Lorelai is rummaging franticly through her dresser for clothes.)
L : It's shorter?
R : They're labeled 'The late girl'.
L : Ohh! So dramatic. Where's the bathroom?
(Rory takes her by the shoulders and steers her through the door.)
R : We have to go! What if there's traffic? Mom!
(Lorelai runs into the bathroom and shuts the door.)
L : I had this all planned. I was gonna get up early. I was gonna get coffee. I was gonna take a shower. I was gonna pick up my clothes from the dry cleaners.
(Lorelai opens the door.)
L : (sighs) Oh my god. My clothes.
R : What?!
(Lorelai walks down the hall with Rory trailing after her.)
L : I don't have any clean clothes.
R : It's 7:15.
L : All my nice things were dirty.
R : It's 7:16.
(Lorelai look in her closet, then turns away.)
L : I was gonna wear my blue suit with the flippy skirt. I look so great in the flippy skirt.
R : It's 7:17.
L : You know what, time lady? Why don't you go downstairs and warm up the car? That would be really super. Thank you.
R : Just hurry!
(Rory goes downstairs, Lorelai rummages through a drawer.)
L : This sucks! This sucks!
R : It's 7:18 (Rory calls from below.)
L : Oh, for the love of god! (sighs) She sits on the bed and puts on socks. This is the last time I ever buy anything just because it's furry. (talking about clock)
(scene changes)
(Lorelai is running down the steps in cowboy boots, really short frayed shorts, and a bright pink tye-dyed tight tee-shirt. She's hurriedly putting her hair into a messy ponytail. Rory is standing at the foot of the stairs and looks up.)
R : It's 7--
L : Don't even think of finishing that sentence. (sighs) What?!
R : Nothing. I just didn't know the rodeo was in town.
L : All right, that's it. (grabs a picture frame) I'm bringing the baby pictures.
(Lorelai runs out the door with Rory in pursuit.)
R : No! I'm sorry! I love the rodeo! The rodeo rules!
(scene changes)
(camera pans through town, finally settling on the jeep, and then the Stars Hollow sign.)
L : I am so done with plans. I am never ever making one again. It never works. I spend the day obsessing over why it didn't work and what I could've done differently.
(scene changes)
(inside jeep, Lorelai is driving, Rory sitting in passenger seat.)
L : I'm analyzing all my shortcomings when all I really need to be doing is vowing to never ever make a plan ever again which I'm doing now. Having, once again, been the innocent victim of my own stupid plans.
(they go past her old school and Rory looks out at all the kids having fun.)
L : God, I need some coffee. (sighs)
(screen shows Jeep driving down several different roads, and then a road sign that says Hartford, 14 miles.)
(screen switches to show different gargoyles, and then the outside of Chilton.)
(Rory and Lorelai sit in Jeep, peering out at Chilton.)
R : I remember it being smaller. (she looks worried)
L : Yeah. And less.. (she looks intimidated)
R : Off with their heads.
L : Ah. (tilts her head, peering up.)
R: (glancing at her mom, does the same.) What are you looking at?
L : I'm just trying to see if there's a hunchback up in that bell tower.
R : So, how do I look?
L : (sighs, sits back and beams with motherly pride.) You look great.
R : Really? (skeptical)
L : Really. You are an amazing kid. You have earned this. You just go in there and show them what smart really is. I love you. Call me if you need me. (reaches for gear)
R: (looks worried) You're kidding, right?
L : No! Call me if you need anything. I'm great at making up dirty cheers.
R : You have to go in with me.
L : Rory, come on. (looks at her clothes meaningfully.)
R : You have to meet the headmaster.
L : Well, look at me! I can't meet anyone who does anything in there. I look like that chick from the 'Dukes of Hazzard'.
R : This is my first day. You are not getting out of going in there with me.
(Rory and Lorelai get out of the jeep. Two moms walking by stare at Lorelai, who drops her coat. They scurry away.)
L : Good morning!
L : (to Rory) Oh, well, we're gonna be best friends.
(Lorelai puts her coat on as they walk into the Chilton courtyard.)
L : So, where do we go.
R : (looks at paper in her hand) Uh, the Ambroise building.
L : Which is?
R : The big, scary one.
L : Oh great! Thanks for the input.
(man walking by looks over at them, especially with some interest to Lorelai.)
(they look around, slightly bewildered)
Man : lost?
L : Oh, yeah. We're looking for the headmaster's office in the Ambroise building.
Man : Ah, okay. Well, this is it right here. (he points beside them) Down the stairs, make a left and the headmaster's office is at the end of the hall.
L : Great. Thank you.
Man : You're welcome.
(Rory grabs Lorelai's arm to go, but the man extends a hand.)
Man : Uh, I'm Ian Jack. My daughter Julia goes to school here. (they shake hands)
L : Hi! I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Rory. (Rory looks slightly uncomfortable.)
Ian : Your daughter? Really. (surprised) Wow, that's great. Uh I mean, daughters are a great thing.
L : We're big fans. (they're flirting)
Ian : (laughing) Yeah. So, is your husband here? I'd love to meet him.
L : Um, no. I'm not married. I'd love to meet your wife, though.
Ian : I'm divorced.
L : Shame.
R : Excuse me. I really got to..
L : (grabs Rory's arm) Right! We gotta go meet the big guy, and I gotta get back to work.
(they rush off)
Ian : (calls) Where do you work?
L : (rushes back) At an inn. The Independence Inn. I run it.
Ian : Really?
L : In a different outfit, of course.
Ian : Ha. Well, It was nice to meet you, Lorelai. Good luck in school, Rory. I'll tell Julia to look out for you.
R : Great, thanks.
Ian : See you.
(Lorelai waves a little, smiles, mouths 'bye'.)
L : What a nice, nice man.
R : You're feeling pretty good about yourself right now, aren't you.
L : Yeah (still smiling)
R : Do you want me to get you a mirror?
L : I'm back. Let's go. (smile is gone, they rush off)
(scene changes)
(Lorelai and Rory are walking down the stairs in Chilton. They look around.)
L : Oh, good. More big stuff. (sarcastically)
R : Turn left.
L : Oh
(Rory and Lorelai walk out of the screen. The camera is on three sour looking girls, staring after them. They roll their eyes, look expressively at one another, and continue on their way.)
(screen changes)
(Lorelai and Rory are walking down a hallway, almost to the headmaster's office. They look at their surroundings with apprehension. They get to the door and stand in front of it, just staring.)
L : You ready?
R : No.
L : You ready?
R : Yes.
(They open the doors, and step into a room that contains a desk with a strict looking woman wearing library glasses sitting at it. They stop in front of her.)
L : (clears throat) Um.. Excuse me. (Secretary looks up suddenly. She jumps back slightly.) Oh! How.. Wow. Hi. I.. I'm Lorelai Gilmore. This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore. I named her after me. I was in the hospital all whacked out on Demerol. (glances at Rory, realizes she's rambling.) Never mind. B-B-But we call her 'Rory'. It's short for Lorelai or even 'Hey, you' depending on the.. (Rory nudges her) Is the headmaster here?
Secretary : (gets up, removes her glasses) One moment. (Walks briskly away.)
(The Gilmores watch her until she closes the door.)
L : (whispering) See, that's what happens when you go to bed with your makeup on.
(Rory grins, Lorelai sighs)
(Door opens behind them, Secretary stands there stiffly, as if announcing a guest.)
Secretary : Headmaster Charleston will see you now.
L : (clears throat) Great. Thanks.
(They walk into room, secretary shuts door.)
Headmaster : (extending hand) Ms. Gilmore, I'm headmaster Charleston.
L : Hi. Wow. It's really nice to meet.. (looks around, looks again at corner, sees her mother on couch) Mom. Uh, ex.. What are you doing here?
Grandmother : (sweeps past Lorelai) I came to wish my granddaughter luck on her first day of school. (Lorelai looks exasperated) Rory, you look wonderful in that uniform!
L : You didn't have to come all the way out here, Mom.
Grandmother : This gave me a chance to make sure that Hanlin here takes good care of Rory.
L : (gestures to Headmaster) You're Hanlin.
Headmaster : Hanlin Charleston.
Grandmother : Hanlin's wife and I are on the symphony fundraising committee together.
L : Wow. That's great.
Headmaster : Your father and I are golf rivals. We're still fighting it out to see which one is worse.
Grandmother : Oh, yes. We're all old friends.
L : Well, there's nothing like friends. Especially if they're old.
(Everyone looks a tad oddly around at her remark.)
Headmaster : Would you like to take off your coat and have a seat?
L : (looks frightened) Oh, no. No, I'm fine.
Headmaster : I'm afraid they were a little overzealous with the furnace this morning. It's quite warm in here.
L : I like it warm. (nodding her head like an idiot)
Grandmother : Lorelai, take off your coat and sit down. You don't want Hanlin to think you're rude. (commanding tone of voice)
L : (looking extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed, takes off coat. Everyone stares, grandmother rolls her eyes. Exhales loudly.) Laundry day.
Grandmother : Hanlin, did you know that Rory has a 4.0 grade point average?
L : I'm sure he does, Mom.
Grandmother : This is a very special girl. You take good care of her.
Headmaster : We'll do our best, Emily.
(everyone sits down)
L : Rory's not going to be a problem. She's totally low maintenance. You know, like a Honda. You know, they're just easy, just.. (Rory looks embarrassed) Nice office.
Grandmother : Well, I don't think we should take up anymore of your precious time. It was lovely to see you. Give Bitty our love. (kisses cheeks with headmaster)
Headmaster : Tell Richard I'll see him at the club Sunday.
Grandmother : Have a wonderful day, Rory. I want to hear all about it. Do you need a ride or is your horse parked outside? (to Lorelai) (walks out of room)
L : It's so nice to meet you. (shakes hands with headmaster, kisses Rory's forehead.) Have a great day.
Headmaster : Oh, you don't want to forget your coat.
L : (turns) Oh no, 'cause that would be embarrassing. (laughs, walks out of office.)
(scene changes)
(Lorelai and Grandmother are walking down the hall.)
Grandmother : How do you leave the house looking like that? What kind of an impression did you think you were gonna make?
L : (sighs) What are you doing here, mother?
Grandmother : I told you, I came to put in a good word for Rory.
L : She didn't need a good word.
Grandmother : I'm not allowed here, is that it?
L : I didn't say that.
Grandmother : I'm allowed to pay for it. But I can't actually set foot on the premises. I just want to get the rules straight. How about the street. Can I drive down the street? Maybe I should just avoid the neighborhood altogether. Although my doctor is right down the block. Maybe I can get special permission if I'm bleeding.
L : (looking incredibly annoyed, her patience is wearing thin.) I'm sorry. I was just surprised to see you here.
Grandmother : I thought it was important for this school to know they had a Gilmore amongst them.
L : A very good thought.
Grandmother : And that some of the Gilmores actually own clothing.
L : And on that note, I have to get to work. I'll see you later.
Grandmother : Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please.
(Lorelai walks away, thrusts out her arms in annoyance.)
(Commercials)
(Shows opening sh*t of the outside of Chilton.)
(Headmaster and Rory are sitting in his office.)
Headmaster : You're obviously a bright girl, Miss. Gilmore.
Rory : Thank you.
Headmaster : Good grades. Teachers like you. Not a lot of social activities, though.
Rory : Oh, well, just living at Stars Hollow is kind of a social activity, actually.
Headmaster : Nothing in your school appealed to you?
Rory : I work at my mother's inn after school sometimes. And I was in the German Club for a while. But there were only three of us. Then two left after seeing "Schindler's List".
Headmaster : What are your aspirations?
Rory : I want to go to Harvard to study Journalism and Political Science.
Headmaster : On your way to being
Rory : Christiane Amanpour.
Headmaster : Really?
Rory : Yes.
Headmaster : Not Cokie Roberts?
Rory : No.
Headmaster : Not Oprah, Rosie, or one of the women from 'The View'?
Rory : No.
Headmaster : Why do you wish to be Christiane Amanpour?
Rory : I don't wish to be her, exactly. I just want to do what she does.
Headmaster : Which is?
Rory : Travel, see the world up close, report on what's really going on, and to be part of something big.
Headmaster : And to be a part of something big you have to be on TV? Why not lead the police on a high speed chase, it's a quicker way to achieve this goal.
Rory : Being on TV has nothing to do with it. Maybe I'll be a Journalist and write books or articles about what I see. I just want to be sure that I seesomething. (Headmaster looks at papers.) You'll notice the debating teams also missing from my resume.
Headmaster : (nods and stands up) I've known your Grandparents for quite some time.
Rory : I know.
Headmaster : In fact, I was at a party at their house just last week where I had the most delicious lobster puffs I've ever eaten. I'm very fond of them.
Rory : That's nice.
(Headmaster sits down across from her.)
Headmaster : None of this, however, will be of any benefit to you. Chilton has one of the highest academic standards of any school in America. You may have been the smartest girl at Stars Hollow, but this is a different place. The pressures are greater, the rules are stricter, and the expectations are high. If you make it through, you will have received one of the finest educations one can get. And there should be no reason why you should not achieve all your goals. However, since you are starting late, and are not used to this highly competitive atmosphere, there is a good chance that you will fail. That is fine. Failure is a part of life. But not a part of Chilton. Understand?
R : (looking more and more unsure of herself.) So, you liked the lobster puffs, huh.
Headmaster : Take this to Miss. James in the administration office across the hall.
(he hands her the folder, she takes it and leaves the room, he puts on his glasses.)
(scene changes)
(Rory walks into the administration office, she goes up to the desk and puts down the folder.)
R : Hi, I'm looking for Miss James?
Miss James : Name?
R : Lorelai Gilmore. But I go by Rory.
Miss James : Fill this out, please.
(Miss James takes the folder and gives Rory a sheet and a pencil. Miss James puts down the folder on a desk to the side. The girl at the desk looks around and stealthily takes the folder and gives it to somebody out the window.)
(scene changes)
(It is in the bushes, outside the window. There are three girls there, the same ones that stared at Rory on the stairs.)
Girl 1 : Well?
Girl 2 : Shut up.
Girl 3 : Hurry. Please. Spiders.
Girl 2 : Lorelai Gilmore.
Girl 1 : Nice stripper name.
Girl 2 : Formerly of Stars Hollow High School.
Girl 1 : Where's that?
Girl 2 : Make a left at the haystacks and follow the cows. Perfect attendance, 4.0 grade point average.
Girl 3 : Bugs, dirt, twigs.
Girl 2 : She's a Journalism major.
Girl 1 : That means she's going out for the school paper.
Girl 2 : Not necessarily. She's got a thousand recommendations in here. Popular with the adults.
Girl 1 : And going out for the school paper.
Girl 2 : You don't know she's going out for the paper. She'll never catch up. She's a month behind.
Girl 1 : You can tutor her. Be like a big sister.
Girl 2 : You're funny.
Girl 3 : Okay, lizard, goodbye.
Girl 2 : Why are they letting all these extra people in? They just take up space and screw up the curve. We don't need any new kids here.
Girl 1 : Too late.
(Girl 2 says psst out the window, someone takes the folder.)
(scene changes)
(back in the office, Miss James is giving stuff to Rory.)
Miss James : Here's your locker number, here's your schedule. Here's the rules of the school and the Chilton code of honor. Here are the words to the school song, which must be recited upon demand. This an happen anytime, anyplace. If you do it in Latin you get extra credit. Do you have any questions?
R : Uh, not at the moment.
Miss James : If you do, you can make an appointment with your guidance counselor, Mr. Winters. He handles everything but Bulimia and pregnancy. For that, you have to go to the nurse, or Coach Rubens. Welcome to Chilton.
(scene changes)
(Lorelai is walking down the road by Luke's diner with her dry cleaning. She goes into the door and passes a man on his way out, smiling at him.)
L : (sighs) I already had the longest day of my life and it's only ten o'clock.
Luke : (fixing what looks like a toaster) There's no coffee.
L : That's not funny.
Luke : I can give you herbal tea.
L : This is not an herbal tea morning. This is a coffee morning.
Luke : Every morning for you is a coffee morning.
L : This is a jumbo coffee morning. I need coffee in an IV.
Luke : I can give you tea and a balance bar.
L : Please, please, please tell me you're kidding.
Luke : I'm kidding. (goes back and gets the coffee pot.)
L : You're sick.
Luke : Yep.
L : You're a fiend!
Luke : For here or to go.
L : To go please.
Luke : You want to know what this stuff does to your nervous system?
L : Do you have a chart? Because I love charts.
Luke : Maybe next time. What happened this morning that was so awful.
L : Rory started Chilton.
Luke : Really?
L : Yeah. (sees him looking at her strangely) What?
Luke : That's how you dressed to take Rory to Chilton? That's a fancy school.
L : My clothes were at the cleaners. I had the fuzzy clock and it didn't purr on time.
Luke : It didn't purr?
L : It's fuzzy. It purrs. Never mind. I gotta go. I had a plan, damn it.
Luke : Me too. Next time you're getting tea.
(Lorelai stalks out of the diner. Luke pulls what looks like a chicken bone out of the toaster.)
(scene changes)
(Miss Patty is standing next to the street and lots of little girls in pink outfits are twirling batons.)
Miss Patty : Visualize, Ladies. It's thanksgiving day parade. You're standing on fifth avenue. There's 100 beautiful boys marching in place behind you. And there you are. You are out in front with your fabulous legs and your perfect tush. Your baton is on fire and the crowd goes nuts! Okay, cookie time. (looks around and sees Lorelai walking down the street) Lorelai, hi.
L : Hi, Patty.
Miss Patty : Isn't today Rory's first day at Chilton?
L : Oh, yeah, she's there now. I just got through dropping her off.
Miss Patty : Is that what you wore?
L : Oh, look at the time. See you, Patty.
Miss Patty : Bye.
(Lorelai walks around the jeep and gets in. Miss Patty walks back into the studio.)
Miss Patty : Ladies, what do I see. Naked girls. No, no, keep those leotards on. This is not Brazil.
(scene changes)
(Jeep is pulling up to the Gilmore house. Lorelai gets out of the car somewhat uncoordinated with her coffee and her dry cleaning, dropping clothes everywhere. She staggers up to the house and goes in. The phone is ringing, she struggles to find the cordless. Finally finding it in a heap of junk and falling back down onto the couch.)
L : Hello?
Grandmother : Lorelai?
L : Mom?
Grandmother : I'm going shopping this afternoon and I'd thought I'd pick up a few things for Rory.
L : Like what?
Grandmother : A couple of extra skirts and tops for school.
L : Ok, I already took care of that Mom. I got her two skirts and a bunch of tops.
Grandmother : But there a five days in a school week.
L : Are you sure? My days of the week underwear only go till Thursday. (is struggling to pull cowboy boots off.)
Grandmother : Is that a joke?
L : Two skirts are fine. Don't bother.
Grandmother : What if she gets one dirty?
L : Well, then, she'll wear the other one.
Grandmother : What if she gets them both dirty?
L : We'll use this newfangled thing called a washing machine. The town just chipped in and bought one. My turn's Tuesday.
Grandmother : What about socks? Chilton has these special logo socks. Rory should have them. And what about the school sweater. She might want that. And there's a sweater vest and a bookbag.
L : Are you getting a cut of the merchandise?
Grandmother : Rory should have these things. She'll be the only one who doesn't.
L : She'll have them.
Grandmother : I'm at least getting her the Chilton coat. Is she a size 6?
L : Mom, please.
Grandmother : This is a simple question, Lorelai.
L : She's a six, but I'd get a size eight in case she grows.
Grandmother : If she grows, I'll buy another.
L : Ok, well then, a six is great. I gotta go, Mom. Bye.
(scene changes)
(there is a classroom, with a teacher pacing in front lecturing)
Teacher : And while French culture was the dominant outside cultural influence, especially for Russia's monied class, English culture also had it's impact. Tolstoy's favorite author, for instance, was..
Girl 2 : (raises her hand briefly) Dickens.
Teacher : Yes, and last week we discovered Dostoevski's main authorial influences.
Girl 2 : (raises her hand again) George Sand and Balzac. (Rory looks at her slightly apprehensively.)
Teacher : Good. As Tolstoy commenced writing both "w*r and Peace" and "Anna Karenina", Count Leo would turn to..
Girl 2 : "David Copperfield"
Teacher : Correct. He would turn to "David Copperfield" for inspiration.
(door opens and cute guy walks in)
Teacher : Ah, Mr. Dugray.
Guy : Sir. (hands teacher note)
Teacher : Nice to have you back. I hope your Grandfather's feeling better.
Guy : Much better, sir.
Teacher : Good. Take your seat please.
(guy walks over to his seat, leering openly at Rory, making her uncomfortable)
Teacher : "Great Expectations", "A Tale of Two Cities", "Little Dorrit", all major influences on Leo Tolstoy.
(guy leans forward to talk to his friend in the seat in front of him)
Guy 1 : Who's that?
Guy 2 : New girl.
Teachers : of these two literary masters, Tolstoy and Dickens. (bell rings) Class dismissed.
(Girls 1, 2, and 3 are all looking over at Rory's notes and her with disdain, Rory tries to smile at them)
Guy 1 : Looks like we got ourselves a Mary. (looking at Rory)
Teacher : Miss, uh, Gilmore, could you come up here please? (she goes up to him) This is last week's study material. (he hands her a huge binder crammed full of papers) There'll be a test on them tomorrow. But since you're new, you can take a makeup test on Monday. Will that be sufficient time?
R : Monday? Sure, that's fine. (looking overwhelmed)
Teacher : That's just an overview. You'll find it very helpful to you to borrow one of the other student's personal notes. They tend to be more detailed.
R : More detailed than this?
Teacher : It seems daunting right now, I know.
R : No, no. It's okay. I'll be fine. (moves to leave the room)
Teacher : Remember to get those notes. They'll be a lifesaver.
(scene changes)



(Rory is coming out of the room and almost walks into Girl 2)
Girl 2 : I'm Paris.
R : I didn't see you there. Where'd you come from.
Paris : I know who you are, too. Lorelai Gilmore from Stars Hollow.
R : You can call me Rory.
Paris : Are you going out for the 'Franklin'?
R : The what?
Paris : Nice innocent act. At least I know you're not going out for drama club. The Franklin, the school paper, are you going out for it?
R : I have to find my locker first.
Paris : I'm gonna be editor next year.
R : Well, good for you. (tries to move away, but Paris steps in front of her)
Paris : I'm also the top of the class, and I intend to be valedictorian when I graduate.
R : Okay. I'm going now.
Paris : You'll never catch up. You'll never b*at me. This school is my domain and the Franklin is my domain. And don't you ever forget that. (she walks off)
R : (looks after her strangely) I guess you're not going to let me borrow your notes, huh. (continues down hallway)
(Commercials)
(opening scene of the outside of the Independence Inn. Switches to kitchen where Sookie is smelling peaches with Fruit Man looking on)
Sookie : They're smaller than the last batch.
Fruit Man : No, they're not.
Sookie : Smaller means watery. No good peach taste.
Fruit Man : No, there's plenty of peach taste being as they're, you know, peaches.
Sookie : What about the ones on the bottom.
Fruit Man : Oh, great. Be sure to check them all. (sarcastically) That's it. Give every last one of them a nice good squeeze. You wouldn't actually want to leave me one that I could sell to somebody else. Wait a minute, you missed one. I'm not going to tell you which one it is. I'm just going to let your impeccably good radar (she picks up peach) There it is, you got it. (throws up hands)
(Lorelai walks into kitchen)
L : Okay, I look great, right?
Sookie : Yes.
L : This is how I was supposed to look. Good morning Jackson (Fruit Man).
Sookie : This was Rory's first day.
L : I was supposed to look fabulous, and not like I'd been up all night playing quarters.
Sookie : Nobody cares how you looked.
L : Everybody cared.
Sookie : Who?
L : The other moms, the Headmaster, my mom, Luke, Miss Patty, the new fire chief with the tiny head.
Sookie : (holds out a peach) Taste this.
L : (bites peach) A little watery.
Jackson : Oh! Now, you planned this!
Sookie : Did you say something about your mother?
L : I walked into the headmaster's office, and there she was.
Sookie : Really? Why?
L : Because she knew I'd wake up late and humiliate myself.
Sookie : Wow, she's good.
L : She's the best.
(Sookie takes peach and rolls it along the floor.)
Jackson : Oh, I would love to know what you're doing.
Sookie : They're rolling differently, too. Because of the extra water.
Jackson : Makes perfect sense.
Sookie : I would ignore those women, cause the only thing that matters is that Rory got into that great school.
L : She looked so amazing in her uniform. She was so excited. I just admire her so much jumping into a new school. She's my hero.
Sookie : Mine too!
Jackson : Oh, yeah. Sign me up. Sookie, the peaches, please. (exasperated)
(Michel walks in)
Michel : (French accent) Excuse me. There's a phone call for you. If I'm to fetch you like a dog, I'd like a cookie and a raise.
L : Thanks for the peach. (hands the peach to Jackson, Sookie takes the peach, Lorelai walks out)
(scene changes)
(parlor at Inn, old women are looking at book and walking by, Lorelai walks by them with Michel trailing)
Woman 1 : This would be absolutely wonderful. There are supposed to be darling shops all up and down this street. Oh, excuse me sir (to Michel). Can you tell me where we'd find the best antiques?
Michel : At your house, I'd guess. (walks off, women are dismayed)
L : Mom, did I give you this number? Because I don't remember giving you this number. Yeah, well, I must be losing my mind. What can I, uh, sorry Mom, can you hold on one second? Um, Drella, can you take it down just a notch? (Drella is the harp player, and is playing very loud, she ignores Lorelai) Thanks. Okay, I'm back.
Grandmother : I wanted you to known that I just bought a parking space for Rory at Chilton.
L : You what?
Grandmother : They are very hard to come by. But I pulled a few strings and it's all hers.
L : Mom, Rory doesn't have a car.
Grandmother : No, but she's got a birthday coming up soon.
(Drella is still playing loudly and Lorelai can't hear)
L : Okay, hold on a second. Um, Drella. Drella! A little softer please.
Drella : Hey, do I look like I got Panasonic stamped on my ass?
L : Mom, you are not buying Rory a car.
Grandmother : Why not? She's a smart girl, she's responsible.
L : She doesn't need one.
Grandmother : She has to have a way to get around. To get to school.
L : She'll be taking the bus.
Grandmother : I hate that she's taking the bus. Drug dealers take the bus.
L : You know what, Mom? I gotta go.
Grandmother : Fine. We'll discuss this at a later date.
L : Okay. Bye.
(Drella plays much softer now that Lorelai is off the phone.)
(scene changes)
(Rory is walking down a Chilton hallway and Guy 1 comes up behind her.)
Guy 1 : Hey, Mary.
R : Me?
Guy 1 : Yeah, you.
R : My name is Rory.
Guy 1 : I'm Tristin.
R : Hi.
Tristin : So you new?
R : Yeah, first day.
Tristin : Remmy's class is rough.
R : Yeah, it seemed very intense.
Tristin : I could loan you my notes, if that would help.
R : Really? That's be great.
Tristin : Yeah? How great? (he's walking forward, pushing her up against the wall)
R : I don't know. Mr. Remmy said that getting someone's notes would be..
Tristin : I could even help you study. If you want.
R : Uh, I kind of view studying as a solitary activity. But thanks.
Tristin : Bye Mary. (he walks off)
R : It's Rory.
(scene changes)
(it's the parlor again, with Drella playing harp and people listening to her. Lorelai is talking to a man and a teenage guy)
L : I completely understand.
Man : Oh, do you. Because this is a brand-new car. (the boy tries to say something) He brings the car up and it's scratched!
Boy : I just backed the car up.
Man : I'd know if my car was scratched before I parked it or not.
L : Let's calm down. Sir, why don't I have your car looked at tomorrow. I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this. In the meantime I would love for you to have lunch here, on me. Dessert is a must. Anything with our homemade ice cream is delicious. Life as you know it will never be the same. What do you say?
Man : I think I will. Thank you.
L : Thank you. (man walks off)
Boy : Lorelai, I swear, I didn't scratch his car. If you thought I was unreliable or a bad driver..
L : Derek. It's okay.
Boy : 'Cause I can drive.
L : Oh, sweetie. I am sure you can. We'll just take it over to Musky's tomorrow and have the guys look at it. I'm sure they can buff it out for nothing, okay?
Boy : Okay. That's a real nice outfit you're wearing today.
L : Thank you, Derek.
(Derek walks off, Michel walks up)
Michel : Your faithful pooch is here to say "Someone needs to talk with you".
L : It's not my mother, is it?
Michel : It's possible.
(Lorelai looks around him, standing at the counter is Ian Jack, from Chilton)
L : It's possible?
Michel : There's a resemblance. (walks off)
L : Hi.
Ian : Hi. Is this a bad time?
L : No, not at all. What are you doing here?
Ian : Well, I had to meet an associate for lunch, and he was coming up from New York so I thought, "Why not meet him in a beautiful inn?"
L : Good. Enjoy your lunch.
Ian : Thanks. I will. I was also wondering if maybe I could take you out to dinner sometime.
L : We're a little food-obsessed, aren't we?
Ian : It's the company more than the food that interests me.
L : I'm flattered.
Ian : Is that a yes?
L : That's a You're a dad.
Ian : And you're a mom. Although I'm still finding that really hard to believe.
L : No, I mean, you're a Chilton dad.
Ian : Ooh, that sounds bad.
L : Not bad. Just tricky. You know, Rory just started there, and I think I should let her fall in with the bad crowd before I start hooking up with the P.T.A.
Ian: Well, I'm not on the P.T.A.
L : See? There you go, I can't date anyone not on the P.T.A.
Ian : It's just a casual dinner.
L : Sorry. (she walks around the counter)
Ian : Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going to China for a week on business. When I get back I'm going to try again
L : China. Wow.
Ian : Impressed?
L : No. Rome, I'd be impressed. China I'm just "China, wow"
Ian : (laughs, picks up a card from the desk, puts it in his suit) Lorelai Gilmore, General Manager, I'll talk to you soon.
L : Have a safe trip.
Ian : I will. (walks off)
L : (walking him walk off) He does that so well.
Michel : You are making me sick.
L : Aw, now, honey. You try it, I'll watch you walk away too.
Michel : Stop it.
L : Go on now, walk. It can't be that bad.
Michel : Go away. (he walks off, she follows)
L : No. You have to do it with a little more attitude. Make me think you mean it! (she walks off)
(people are listening to Drella play the harp, she suddenly stops)
Drella : That's lunch. (walks off, people look around surprised)
(scene changes)
(Rory is in Chilton, finds her locker, tries to open it, It's stuck, she pulls really hard and it opens, she stumble backward right into Paris who was holding a really big project of a intricate castle and dropped in when she got bumped into. The project broke into a million pieces)
R : Oh no! I am so sorry. Paris, please. I am so sorry. It was an accident. My locker, it just slipped. I pulled too hard.. I didn't mean to.. Is there water in that moat?
Paris : Get away from me! (she stalks off into a classroom)
(Rory picks up her books and puts them in her locker, and then taps a boy walking by)
R : Excuse me, I need Mrs. Ness, History?
Boy : It's behind you. (points to the classroom Paris walked into and leaves)
R : Of course it is. (slams locker and walks into classroom)
Paris : (sees Rory) Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
(Rory sits down in a seat, Tristin sits right near her.)
Tristin : Hey, Mary.
Teacher : Ok, We left our projects off on Friday with Mr. Gaynor. So today we will pick up with Miss Geller.
Paris : (stands up) I don't have my project.
Teacher : Miss Geller.. Did you have sufficient time to complete your project?
Paris : Yes
Teacher : And yet you don't have it done?
Paris : No
Teacher : You will receive an incomplete on the project.
R : (stands up) It's my fault.
Teacher : Who are you?
R : Rory Gilmore. I wrecked her project.
Paris : Shut up.
Teacher : I don't have a Rory Gilmore. I have a Lorelai Gilmore.
R : That's me.
Teacher : You are Rory and Lorelai Gilmore?
R : Yes. And I wrecked her project. My locked got stuck.
Paris : Just stay out of this.
Teacher : Do you go by Rory or Lorelai.
R : Whatever. It's not her fault.
Teacher : I need you to pick one.
R : One what.
Teacher : One name.
R : Rory.
Teacher : Thank you. Rory, you wrecked Paris' project when?
R : Just before class.
Teacher : Very convenient.
R : No, I did. My locked got stuck
Paris : Stop it!
Teacher : Miss Gilmore, since you say you wrecked Miss Geller's project, then you may help her fix it. You have until tomorrow.
R : Fine.
Paris : No. I don't want your help!
R : But I don't mind doing it.
Paris : Just stay out of this.
R : I'm trying to help you.
Paris : Well don't!
Teacher : Ladies, enough. Miss Geller, if you don't want Miss Gilmore's help you may have until tomorrow. If it's not done, you will receive an incomplete. Is that understood?
Paris : Yes. (sits down)
Teacher : As long as you're standing, Class, we have a new student. Say hello to Rory Gilmore.
Class : Hi, Rory.
Tristin : Hello Mary.
(Rory sits down)
(Commercials)
(opening scene is the Welcome to Stars Hollow sign, Population 9,973. Scene shifts to Miss Patty next to the street and the girls in the studio, walking with books on their heads.)
Miss Patty : Walk smooth. That's the new Harry Potter on your heads. If they should drop, Harry will die, and there won't be anymore books. (sees Lorelai walking by) Now that's how you should've dressed this morning, Missy.
(Lorelai ignores her, scene shifts to Lorelai walking into Luke's diner. Luke is walking near the entrance and he has to squeeze by her to get through.)
Luke : What are you doing here?
L : See, now that's why you were voted Mr. Personality of the New Millennium. Where's your crown?
Luke : I just mean you don't usually come it at this time.
L : I have to pick up Rory from school. (Luke pours her coffee without any argument) Thank you.
Luke : You're welcome.
L : No lectures?
Luke : My blood sugar's low. I'll eat an apple and get back to you.
L : God, this has been one hectic, bizarro day for me.
Luke : Yeah?
L : Yeah. This morning with the being late. And my mother with her existing. Oh, and this father. This father from Chilton. He drove all the way from Hartford just to ask me out.
Luke : Really? Are you going? (trying to appear like he doesn't care)
L : No. He's got a kid in school with Rory. The whole thing just seemed a little weird.
Luke : Good.
L : Good?
Luke : Yeah, I think it's good that you turned him down.
L : Okay.
Luke : I mean, he's probably old, right?
L : Old?
Luke : I mean, he's got a kid in high school.
L : Well, so do I.
Luke : Yeah, but you were young when you had Rory. Most people aren't that young. Most people are..
L : Old.
Luke : Yeah.
L : Like this guy who asked me out.
Luke : But you're not going.
L : No. No, I'm not going.
(she kind of smiles a bit, thinks he likes her, her cell phone rings, he points to the sign that says no cell phones)
L : Oh, that's me. Hi Babette. What? Okay. No. No, I'll be right there. Thanks. (hangs up) Uh, I have to go. (pulls out wallet)
Luke : Keep it. I gave you decaf.
(she frowns and walks out the door)
(scene changes)
(A man and a woman holding a cat are sitting in their yard. They live right next to the Gilmores. Lorelai's jeep pulls up and she gets out)
L : Hey.
Babette : Oh, Lorelai, I'm so sorry I had to call you like this.
L : That's okay, Babette. I appreciate it.
Babette : All of a sudden, they pull up, get out of the truck, and start sniffing around. It's very strange.
L : Let me go talk to them.
(Lorelai pets cat, Man gets up and stands next to Babette)
Man : Tell her about the gnome.
Babette : They kicked a gnome.
L : What?
Babette : Right in the head.
Man : That's just not cool.
L : I'm very sorry. Is the gnome okay?
Babette: He's fine, sugar. But I wouldn't trust these boys. Gnome kicking says a lot about a man's character.
L : Yes, well, I'm gonna go take care of this. Thanks.
(she walks over to her house, men are on the porch, she goes up the steps to talk to them)
L : Hey. Um, what are you doing?
Man 1 : You live here?
L : Yeah.
Man 1 : I'm supposed to install a DSL for a Lorelai Gilmore. Is that you?
L : Yes, but..
Man 1 : I'm Mick.
L : Nice to meet you. Could you get off my porch?
Mick: I was told that you wouldn't be here, but to look for a ceramic frog with a key inside. We can't find the frog.
L : I didn't order a DSL.
Mick : The order was placed by an -- Emily Gilmore (grandmother). We would've been done by now, but the frog search put us way behind.
Man 2 : Hey, Mick, found it.
Mick : You found the frog?
Man 2 : It wasn't a frog, it was a turtle.
Mick : It says here it's a frog.
L : Turtle.
Mick : Really?
L : Trust me. I'm going to have to cancel that DSL order.
Mick : You sure? It's already paid for.
L : Yeah, I know. We don't need a DSL, so thanks for coming, and you guys can just go.
(the guys leave, Lorelai walks over to the jeep)
Babette : Is there a problem?
L : Oh, nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn into a really good play.
(Lorelai gets into jeep)
(scene changes)
(camera is on a piece of paper that says "Paris -- I am so sorry. Please let me help you." In Rory's handwriting )
Teacher : The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three walls around themselves, with which they have hitherto protected themselves so that no one could reform them, whereby Christians has fallen terribly. Who said this?
(Rory gave the note to Paris, who immediately crumpled it up and threw it on the floor)
R : (sees Paris about to give the answer) Martin Luther.
Teacher : Very good, Miss Gilmore. And what year does Martin Luther address the Christian nobility?
R : (again sees Paris lean forward) 1520.
Teacher : Very good, Miss Gilmore. Until next time, class.
(Paris goes up to Rory's desk)
Paris : Stay out of my way. I will make this school a living hell for you. (Rory swallows apprehensively.)
Tristin : See you tomorrow, Mary.
Rory : The name is Rory.
(scene changes)
(camera shows a street corner, then switches to the inside of a salon where Lorelai appears to be searching for somebody.)
Stylist : Can I help you?!
L : (brushes past her) God, I wish. (knocks on her mother's hairdryer)
Grandmother : What on earth..?
L : You're not buying us a DSL.
Grandmother : Lorelai, this is hardly the place.
L : I canceled the order, and it's not happening.
Grandmother : But Rory needs the Internet for her school.
L : We have the Internet.
Grandmother : This is faster.
L : Well, we like our internet slow, okay? We can turn it on, walk around, dance, make a sandwich. With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking, and we'd starve. It'd be all work and no play. Have you not seen "The Shining", Mom?
Grandmother : What on earth are you talking about?
L : Also, there will be no cars, no parking spaces. And all the uniforms will be supplied by me. The mother. That's final. There will be no discussion.
Grandmother : You're being stubborn, as usual.
L : No, Mom, I'm not being stubborn. I'm being me! The same person who always needed to work out her own problems and take care of herself. Because that's the way I was born. That's how I am!
Grandmother : Florence, I'm dripping.
L : I appreciate what you have done for Rory in paying for this school, That will not be forgotten. You won't let it. But she is my daughter. And I decide how we live, not you. Now then, do they validate parking here?
Grandmother : There's a stamp at the desk.
L : Thank you.
(Emily looks embarrassed and dismayed. Lorelai walks out.)
(scene changes)
(It's the outside of Chilton. Lorelai is drinking coffee and waiting for Rory to come out. Rory emerges.)
L : Mm. Hey, you.
R : (drops backpack and hugs Lorelai) So, this whole plaid-skirt thing My idea?
L : My day sucked too.
R : Promise?
L : I swear on my mother's life.
R : Not yet. (doesn't want to stop hugging.)
L : Still hugging, still hugging. (smooch) So, I brought us some coffee.
R : Why, I'm shocked.
L : Triple caps, easy foam. If that doesn't work, we'll stick our fingers in a light socket. (laughs, picks up backpack) Come here. (staggers under weight) What, do they expect you to get smart all in one day?
R : Oh, they expect a lot of things.
L : So tell me.
R : I don't know. It was just one big, long, scary, tweedy, bad eight hours.
L : Add some hair spray, and you got my day.
R : One of the girls already hates me. The guys are weird.
L : Weirder than other guys?
R : Yeah, they kept calling me Mary.
L : You're kidding me. Wow, I can't believe they still say that.
R : Why? What does it mean?
L : It means like, Virgin Mary. It means they think you look like a goody-goody.
R : You're kidding.
L : No.
R : Well what would they have called me if they thought I looked like a slut?
L : Well, they might have added a Magdalene to it.
R : Wow. Biblical insults. This is an advanced school.
(they laugh, Lorelai turns over the engine)
(scene changes)
(it's night, the town is lit up by lights along the streets. Lorelai, Rory, and Lane are all walking with food in hand.)
Lane : It was so weird not having you in school today. I mean, I finally noticed some of the other kids. Let me say, they are a sad lot.
R : Yeah, well add a couple plaid skirts, and you got the Chilton freaks.
Lane : I totally miss you.
R : I miss you.
L : I have an idea. What about, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, when I go into Hartford for my business class, what if Lane comes along and you guys can shop and study, and join a cult and shave your heads.
Lane : Really?
L : All except the shaving your heads part.
Lane : Oh, no. What time is it?
R : 6:30
Lane : Oh, no. I'm late for dinner.
L : Again? Lane, your mother is gonna k*ll me if I keep sending you home fat and happy.
Lane : I'm sorry. But she found a web site that sells Tofu in bulk.
L : Oh, you're kidding, right?
Lane : (shakes her head) Yesterday, she went out and bought a bigger fridge. (takes off her pink jacket, handing it to Rory, and shaking out her hair.)
L : Boy, honey, your life is scary.
Lane : Can I have your crust? (to Rory, pizza crust)
R : It's the least I can do.
Lane : Thanks. Bye.
R : Bye.
L : Bye. (watches her leave) A pizza for your thoughts.
R : I wish I could figure out a way to get Paris off my back.
L : Yeah, angry chicks are the worst. When I was in high school I had a Paris.
R : Yeah?
L : It was horrible.
R : How'd you get rid of her?
L : I got pregnant and dropped out.
R : What if I just learn to french braid her hair.
L : Even better. Sweetie, you can't let those kids get you down. Do you want me to talk to anybody? A parent, a teacher, a big guy named Moose?
R : I'll just figure it out for myself.
L : Okay. (sees Rory laugh) What?
R : I was just thinking about the way Paris' face looked when I b*at her to that Martin Luther question.
L : Good, huh?
R: 14 shades of purple.
L : Cool.
R: Tomorrow I'm sh**ting for 15.
L : (they stop in front of Luke's diner) Hey, what do you think of Luke?
R : What do you mean?
L : I mean, do you think he's cute?
R: Oh, no. No way. You cannot date Luke.
L : I said nothing about dating Luke.
R : If you date him, you'll break up. And we'll never be able to eat there again.
L : I repeat, I said nothing about dating Luke.
R : Date Al from Pancake World, his food stinks.
L : I cannot believe what I'm hearing. Al's food does not stink, Al stinks.
(Luke comes out of the diner and stares after the Gilmores. Then he closes his restaurant and goes back inside.)

k*ll Me Now
(The scene opens at the Gilmores' weekly dinner.)
RICHARD: Dinner was lovely, Emily.
EMILY: Mira does make a perfect cassoulet.
LORELAI: Who's Mira?
EMILY: Our cook.
LORELAI: I thought the cook was Heidi.
EMILY: Oh, no, we let Heidi go months ago. She had a problem closing things -- the door, the refrigerator --
RICHARD: The liquor bottle.
EMILY: Then it was Trina, then Sophia.
RICHARD: Oh, I liked Sophia.
EMILY: You did not.
RICHARD: I didn't?
EMILY: She was the one who sang.
RICHARD: That's right -- terrible woman.
EMILY: And after Sophia we had Anton.
RICHARD: That's right. Anton was the one that I liked.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, Dad, how do you mix up Anton and Sophia?
RICHARD: What do you mean?
LORELAI: Well, one is a man and one is a woman.
RICHARD: And your point being?
LORELAI: That one is a man and one is a woman.
RICHARD: I have a lot to do in a day, Lorelai, I don't have time to keep up with a multitude of people that your mother employs.
LORELAI: But one is a man and one is a woman.
(The cook brings in a cake.)
LORELAI: The dinner was so wonderful, Mira.
SARAH: It's Sarah.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm sorry.
(Sarah leaves.)
LORELAI: Mom! Her name is Sarah!
EMILY: I thought she said Mira.
LORELAI: Ugh!
RORY: Hey, Grandma, these plates are really pretty.
EMILY: Thank you, Rory. They were your great-grandmother's.
RICHARD: Lorelai the first.
RORY: I thought Mom was the first.
EMILY: Not in the name.
LORELAI: No, but in so many other things I was a regular trailblazer. Just finishing your thought, Mom.
RICHARD: Lorelai the first was my mother. She was an extremely accomplished equestrian, a distinguished patron of the arts, and she was also world-famous for her masquerade balls. She was quite a woman, my mother.
EMILY: Yes she was. Mira, come cut the cake please.
LORELAI: Yes, and why don't you bring Sarah out here with you?
EMILY: So, Lorelai, how are things at that charming little inn of yours?
LORELAI: Mm -- they're still charming and little. We're just crossing our fingers it doesn't assert itself and become rude and large.
RORY: Mom's having a huge wedding there this week.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: Yeah, actually there's people coming from all over the country.
EMILY: Well, isn't that nice?
LORELAI: Yeah.
EMILY: Rory, how's Chilton?
LORELAI: OK, done with me now.
EMILY: I'm sorry, was there more to the story?
LORELAI: Uh, Rory has to pick a team sport to play.
RORY: It's a requirement.
RICHARD: Physical fitness is as important as intellectual fitness. So says Plato and so say I.
EMILY: What sport are you going to pick?
RORY: I'm not sure. I'm not really the athletic type.
LORELAI: I told her she should go out for the debating team.
RORY: It's not a sport.
LORELAI: It is the way the Gilmores play.
EMILY: So, what are your choices?
RORY: God, there's like a thousand of them: basketball, lacrosse, swimming, track, golf --
EMILY: Golf?
RORY: Yeah.
EMILY: Well your grandfather is a golf player.
LORELAI: Oops.
EMILY: He plays every week at the club. He could teach you to play like a pro.
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: Why, he could take you there on Sunday. It's perfect.
RICHARD: It's not something you can teach in an afternoon.
LORELAI: That's OK. Rory can pick something else.
EMILY: Why should she pick something else? She needs to learn a sport and Richard can teach her a sport. (to Rory) You can use your mother's old golf clubs. They're upstairs gathering dust along with the rest of her potential.
LORELAI: OK, Mom, can I maybe talk to you for a minute?
EMILY: We're having dessert.
LORELAI: I know but I'd like to talk to you fast before the sugar sets in and makes me crazy.
EMILY: You are the oddest person.
LORELAI: Too easy.
(Lorelai and Emily get up from the table and go into another room to talk.)
EMILY: What is so important it can't wait for cake?
LORELAI: Keep moving.
EMILY: This is as far as I can go unless you'd like me to bore my way through the wall.
LORELAI: Don't do this, Mom.
EMILY: Do what?
LORELAI: Force Rory and Dad to go golfing.
EMILY: I'm not forcing anybody.
LORELAI: Well you're manipulating the situation in a way that gives no one a way out. That's force. Look it up.
EMILY: I'm just trying to help your daughter get an education.
LORELAI: Thank you. She'll find another sport.
EMILY: Why should she?
LORELAI: Because she doesn't want to go and Dad doesn't want to take her.
EMILY: Oh, your father doesn't know what he wants. He'd get his hair cut at the butcher if I let him.
LORELAI: Let it go please.
EMILY: Well, isn't this interesting? You're afraid.
LORELAI: Of what?
EMILY: That Rory will enjoy the club and have a good time without you.
LORELAI: That's crazy.
EMILY: I agree.
LORELAI: I'm not afraid.
EMILY: Then let her go.
LORELAI: She won't enjoy it, Mom.
EMILY: Well why don't you just let Rory decide?
LORELAI: Because Rory is the sweetest kid in the whole world and she won't tell you that she doesn't want to go becasue she's too afraid of hurting your feelings.
EMILY: Oh I'm sure you can give her some coaching to help her get over that.
LORELAI: I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, Mom. Believe it or not, this is not about you.
EMILY: Of course it's about me. If Rory goes and has a good time without you, then I win.
LORELAI: OK, Bob Barker. Listen, Rory knocks herself out all week at Chilton. Weekends are the only time she has to unwind and have fun.
EMILY: With you?
LORELAI: I'm there.
EMILY: So let me get this straight. There's no way that Rory can possibly enjoy a weekend day with her grandfather.
LORELAI: You're just going to twist it all around, aren't you?
EMILY: And you know your daughter so well that you don't even have to ask her opinion on this. She'd be miserable and you know it.
LORELAI: I am so setting myself up here, but yes, she would be miserable.
EMILY: That sounds a little controlling to me.
LORELAI: Yeah I walked right into that.
EMILY: Interesting, isn't it, you being the one who's controlling?
LORELAI: I am not being --
EMILY: According to you I was the only one in the family with that particular gift.
LORELAI: Mom I never said that!
EMILY: I guess you and I are more alike that you thought, aren't we?
LORELAI: You win.
(Later, Lorelai and Rory are leaving for home.)
LORELAI: (sighs) Oh, man, did you get blindsided? I'm so sorry.
RORY: That's OK.
LORELAI: I tried to stop it, I swear.
RORY: I know. Maybe it won't be that bad.
LORELAI: Maybe it won't.
RORY: Maybe I'll like it.
LORELAI: Maybe you will.
RORY: Maybe you could come with me.
LORELAI: Oh, is there a "you're crazy" team? 'Cause I think they'd make you captain.
RORY: Please?
LORELAI: Rory, I love you. I would take a b*llet for you. But I'd rather stick something sharp in my ear than go to the club with you.
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: I'd rather slide down a banister of razor blades and land in a pool of alcohol than go to the club with you.
RORY: I got it.
LORELAI: Don't stop me, I'm on a roll. I'd rather eat my own hand than go to the club with you. Ooh, I'd rather get my face surgically altered to look like that lunatic rich lady with the lion head than go to the club with you.
RORY: Would you like me to drive so you can continue your diatribe?
LORELAI: Would ya? Thanks. I'd rather cut off my head and use it as a punch bowl than go to the club with you.
(Cut to the inn. Lorelai escorts the brides, Jackie and Jessica, and their mother around the grounds.)
LORELAI: You'll walk down here over the bridge with the swans floating by and the music playing --
JACKIE: What are they doing with those purple flowers?
LORELAI: Just decorating the bridge.
JACKIE: I didn't want purple flowers. I wanted pink.
JESSICA: And I wanted blue.
LORELAI: So I thought violet would be a nice compromise.
JACKIE: But we paid for pink flowers.
JESSICA: And blue flowers.
MRS. SHALES: You did not pay for anything. I told her to decorate with violet flowers and while it's very nice of her to try to take the heat for me it's certainly not necessary. If you don't like it, buy your own flowers. (silence) Yes, I thought so. Now go away. My Advil is wearing off.
(The twins walk away.)
MRS. SHALES: Their father spoiled them.
LORELAI: Oh, they're just excited.
MRS. SHALES: They're spoiled. And they won't move away.
MRS. SHALES: Now, disaster list. What if it rains?
LORELAI: We'll put up tents.
MRS. SHALES: What if it's too windy?
LOREAI: Well, then we'll secure everything and put extra hair spray in everybody's hair.
MRS. SHALES: Too hot?
LORELAI: We'll use umbrellas and fans that won't cause any damage because of the things that have been secured and the hair that has been sprayed.
MRS. SHALES: So I have nothing to worry about.
LORELAI: Nope.
MRS. SHALES: Well there must be something.
LORELAI: Listen, I have everything under control. Why don't you go up to your room and have a fabulous bubble bath and I'll send up some wine and a masseuse who bears a remarkable resemblance to Antonio Banderas.
MRS. SHALES: How remarkable?
LORELAI: Get ready to applaud.
MRS. SHALES: This is my favorite place in the whole world.
(Inside the inn Michel is handling gift baskets.)
LORELAI: (to an employee) Could you send Maury up to room twelve in about twenty minutes? Thanks. (to Michel) So, any problems?
MICHEL: With the wedding or my life?
LORELAI: One guess -- and I'll give you a hint: it's not your life.
MICHEL: Do you stage these events to torture me?
LORELAI: Yes.
MICHEL: Job well done.
LORELAI: OK, let's start again. Any problems?
MICHEL: Guests are checked in, baskets are given out, and 200,000 tons of Jordan almonds have been delivered.
LORELAI: OK, good. Did Rory call?
MICHEL: No.
LORELAI: Hmm. She's golfing all day with my father and I'm half expecting this big "save me" call to come in -- you don't care at all do you?
MICHEL: To me you are the teacher in the Charlie Brown cartoon.
LORELAI: OK, forget it. So, have the grooms arrived? Their plane was supposed to get in a 7 so I'm surprised they're not here by now.
MICHEL: Well maybe they made a run for it.
LORELAI: Ooh, somebody got stood up at the prom.
MICHEL: Oh. Dear.
LORELAI: What?
(Male twins have just walked in the front door.)
MICHEL: Are those -- ?
LORELAI: No. It would be too --
(The brides rush into the grooms' arms.)
LORELAI: -- weird.
MICHEL: You kept this from me on purpose.
LORELAI: It's like a really snooty Doublemint commercial.
MICHEL: Just let me know when the midgets and clowns arrive.
(Michel tries to leave.)
LORELAI: Oh, no, no, no. You have to get them all settled in.
MICHEL: I'm not talking to them.
LORELAI: Yes you are.
MICHEL: Well I'm not talking to them nicely.
(Cut to Emily and Richard's house.)
RICHARD: It's after 8:00. She should be here already.
EMILY: She'll be here.
RICHARD: You're supposed to tee off at your designated time.
EMILY: You pay good money to that place. You'll tee off when you tee off. Is that what you're wearing?
RICHARD: Yes.
EMILY: Hmm.
RICHARD: What's wrong with what I'm wearing?
EMILY: Nothing. It's fine.
RICHARD: This whole thing is absurd.
EMILY: She's your granddaughter.
RICHARD: She's a sixteen year old who would rather be at the mall.
EMILY: Make sure you show her all around the club, especially the rose garden.
RICHARD: I am not a guide.
EMILY: And make sure you take her to lunch and have her get dessert.
RICHARD: No one said anything about lunch.
EMILY: I hope Lorelai's clubs are still in good shape.
RICHARD: Emily you are not listening to me. I will teach her to play golf, as promised by you, but lunch is out of the question.
EMILY: You have to eat.
RICHARD: Yes, but --
EMILY: So you'll eat together. Do you ahve sunscreen?
(The doorbell rings.)
RICHARD: Emily.
(The doorbell rings again.)
EMILY: She's here.
RICHARD: Ah, 8:30. We must remember to buy her a watch.
EMILY: Richard, so help me God, you will be sweet to this girl and make this a memorable day for her. This is the first time we've gotten to show our granddaughter off at the club and it means a great deal to my happiness -- and yours -- that this day go well. Are we clear?
(Silence. Emily opens the door.)
EMILY: Rory, hello.
RORY: Sorry I'm late.
EMILY: Nonsense. You're right on time.
RORY: Hi, Grandpa.
RICHARD: Rory, nice to see you.
EMILY: This is a perfect day for golfing, isn't it Richard?
RICHARD: It was cooler at 8.
RORY: Am I dressed OK? I didn't have any of those short pant things.
EMILY: Well, actually there is something missing. Oh, wait a minute...
(She puts a hat on Rory's head.)
EMILY Here you go. Now you look just like Tiger Woods.
RORY: Wow, that's some hat.
EMILY OK, off you go, you two. Have a wonderful time.
RORY: We will.
RICHARD: You bet.
(Cut to Richard and Rory walking along the golf course.)
RORY: Is it hard to become a member here?
RICHARD: Everyone has to go through a thorough screening process.
RORY: Kind of like the FBI?
RICHARD: We're much more thorough than that.
RORY: Wow.
RICHARD: Yes. Did you know the merger of Forscape and D.S.S.
RORY: Really.
RICHARD: International finance will never be the same and all because of a lost golfing bet.
RORY: That's crazy.
RICHARD: Well that's high finance. Well, here we are. Now, what do you know about golf?
RORY: That it's a good walk spoiled?
RICHARD: (sighs) Well, your driver is the most powerful club in your bag, and as such, it can be your most valuable asset or your greatest liability. To wield it properly requires a precise combination of confidence and humility.
RORY: Confidence and humility. Got it.
RICHARD: There you are. That's a pretty good natural grip. Now, line the toe of your left foot up with the ball. That's right. Now, drop this shoulder a little bit. Now, keeping your left arm firm, draw the club back, swing it cleanly through the ball.
(Rory takes a swing and hits the grass.)
RORY: I'm betting that was wrong.
RICHARD: (wearily) There are no rights and wrongs to the learning process. Try that again.
(Rory does the same thing.)
RORY: I'm betting that was wrong.
(Cut to the kitchen at the inn.)
SOOKIE: These are blueberries. I think ordered strawberries.
JACKSON: I know but --
SOOKIE: Yeah, no, I did. I wrote it down. I got a copy. (reading) Yeah, mushrooms, melon, endive, peaches, kiwi.
JACKSON: Excuse me, crazy lady --
SOOKIE: Oh I should make some kiwi ice cream. That would be good sometime.
JACKSON: Sookie!
SOOKIE: What?
JACKSON: Listen. I know you ordered strawberries but they weren't any good so instead of selling you sub-standard strawberries, I brought blueberries.
SOOKIE: I've got to make strawberry shortcake for 200 people. I think I'm gonna need strawberries.
JACKSON: Use the blueberries.
SOOKIE: To make what?
JACKSON: Blueberry shortcake.
SOOKIE: There's no such thing.
JACKSON: Hey, the world was flat until someone took a boat trip.
SOOKIE: Can I see these strawberries?
JACKSON: No.
SOOKIE: Just one?
JACKSON: No.
SOOKIE: How about a Polaroid?
JACKSON: No.
LORELAI: Coffee, coffee, coffee. Ooh, Sookie, can I take some of this cake home to Rory? She's going to need a special treat tonight. She's spending the entire day with my father golfing at the club.
SOOKIE: No.
JACKSON: Take the blueberries!
SOOKIE: No.
JACKSON: Ugh.
LORELAI: Golfing was masterminded by my mother, of course. One minute we're having an excrutiating family dinner and the next she's manipulating my kid into spending her Sunday with my father at the country club. Oh, I can't talk about it anymore. It's making me too upset. Tell me something happy.
(Sookie is about to cry.)
SOOKIE: I can't make the strawberry shortcake.
LORELAI: Wow. You suck at this game.
MICHEL: The battle for soup versus salad is waging in the other room. Come quick and settle it, please, as I'm running out of French curse words that they won't understand.
(Lorelai and Michel go into the lobby where the twin brides are in each others' faces arguing between soup and salad.)
JESSICA: Soup --
JACKIE: Salad...why are you making such a scene, Jessica? Jessica you are making a --
(Mrs. Shales walks over to Lorelai and Michel.)
MRS. SHALES: It's been 45 minutes of soup or salad. Soup or salad -- I can't do it anymore. Get me a cab. I'm going to go far away now and never come back.
LORELAI: How about if the guests get a choice of soup or salad?
MRS. SHALES: That -- that will work.
LORELAI: Choice of soup or salad.
SOOKIE: Got it.
(The grooms join the brides.)
LORELAI: It's so weird.
SOOKIE: Which one is which?
LORELAI: I don't know. I think the one on the right is Matt.
MICHEL: No, the one on the left is Matt. The one on the right is Mark.
LORELAI: That's very impressive.
MICHEL: Yes, well, I'm very good at observing people, you know, learning the tics and traits, sound of their voices. It's a gift.
SOOKIE: That one has a Post-It on its back.
MICHEL: Oh, well, then that's Mark. The one on the right is Matt.
LORELAI: You will go and take that off of him.
MICHE: I will not. We can't all just call everyone 'sweetie' and get away with it.
SOOKIE: Now, go with me, here. Let's say Mark walks into a hotel room and he sees his wife naked, but it's not his wife, it's his naked sister-in-law, and he has sex with her. Would that be cheating?
MICHEL: My head hurts.
LORELAI: (laughing) I think no.
SOOKIE: Really? Lucky.
MICHEL: If you ask me this union belongs on a public access station. It's against the laws of nature and just this short of completely obscene.
LORELAI: Oh, you won't be giving the wedding toast.
(Lorelai is walking Mrs. Shales to the door.)
LORELAI: How did everything work out?
MRS. SHALES: Do you have children?
LORELAI: A daughter.
MRS. SHALES: Do you hate her?
LORELAI: No.
MRS. SHALES: Not ever?
LORELAI: Well I wasn't wildly fond of her during labor.
MRS. SHALES: That was the high point for me.
(Cut to Rory and Richard walking on the golf course.)
RORY: I can't believe I hit the ball!
RICHARD: Well it was quite impressive.
RORY: It landed in the water.
RICHARD: Yes, but the splash was quite impressive.
RORY: This place is so beautiful. I could see just coming here to think or read. But that probably defeats the purpose of the holes with the flag thing.
RICHARD: There is something rather serene about walking around here.
RORY: Do you come here every week?
RICHARD: No. When I can. I'm often working on the weekends.
RORY: Bummer.
RICHARD: Isn't it.
(Men in a golf cart pass by.)
MAN: Hi Richard.
RICHARD: Hello.
RORY: Can I ask you a question?
RICHARD: Go ahead.
RORY: What do you do?
RICHARD: I'm the executive vice-president of the Gehrman-Driscoll Insurance Corporation.
RORY: Wow.
RICHARD: Yes.
RORY: And as executive vice-president, what do you do?
RICHARD: Well, it's a very big company -- one of the largest in the United States as a matter of fact -- I have a myriad of duties which would bore you greatly to hear about.
RORY: Oh, OK.
RICHARD: I oversee our international division.
RORY: That sounds important.
RICHARD: Well, it rates a parking spot.
RORY: Do you get to travel a lot?
RICHARD: Quite a bit.
RORY: Lucky.
RICHARD: I suspect you have a yen for travelling.
RORY: I'm up to my ears in yens.
RICHARD: Any particular place you'd like to go?
RORY: Hundreds of places. Paris, Rome, London, Prague, Istanbul, Fez -- Have you ever been to Fez?
RICHARD: I can't say that I have.
RORY: I want to go to Fez.
RICHARD: I think travelling for a young girl is a very important thing. Your mother never got a chance to travel much.
RORY: I know. She talks about that all the time.
RICHARD: She does?
RORY: We've got a deal. When I graduate from high school we're going to go backpacking through Europe together. You know, do the whole hostel thing. I just hope it really happens.
RICHARD: Well we'll just have to make sure that it does.
(A golf cart pulls up beside them.)
GLORIA: Richard!
RICHARD: Gloria! You look wonderful.
GLORIA: Aren't you sweet? Is Emily here?
RICHARD: No, I'm taking my granddaughter for a round of golf.
GLORIA: Well, we must get together.
RICHARD: Absolutely.
(Gloria pulls away.)
RICHARD: The most odious woman alive.
(Time lapse.)
RICHARD: Now, we'll meet back here in forty minutes?
RORY: OK.
RICHARD: And then, if you like, we can get some lunch.
RORY: That would be great.
RICHARD: Fine.
RORY: Cool.
RICHARD: Yes.
(Cut to the men's steam room.)
MAN #1: And I'm telling him I've been coming here for twenty years my young friend, and for twenty years that cart, number 43, has been my golf cart.
MAN #2: He should have known that.
MAN #1: Everybody knows that.
MAN #3: Did he give you the cart?
MAN #1: Damn right he gave me the cart.
MAN #2: You should have never had to ask because he should have known that.
RICHARD: Hello, gentlemen.
MAN #1: Richard, good to see you.
RICHARD: Heard about your golf cart. Too bad.
MAN #1: Yeah, well, I'm still angry about it.
RICHARD: Well, yes.
MAN #3: Richard, who was that young lady I saw you on the golf course with?
RICHARD: That is my granddaughter.
MAN #2: Really? She's lovely.
MAN: #1: Lorelai's girl.
RICHARD: Mmm-hmm.
MAN #3: You're lucky. My granddaughter looks like she just fell off a potato truck.
MAN #2: My granddaughter would never be caught here. Might get in the way of the time spent at the tattoo parlor or getting something pierced or doing whatever she does while she runs wild through the streets like a rabid dog.
MAN #1: Cut her off! That would get her attention!
MAN #3: I can help you with the litigation.
RICHARD: Actually, Rory just started Chilton.
MAN #2: (impressed) Really?
MAN #1: Damn fine school.
RICHARD: Said she wanted to learn golf. I think she's taken to it quite well.
MAN #1: Yeah, well, just as long as isn't taken with a certain golf cart.
MAN #2: I'm writing a letter to the board.
MAN #1: I wish you would. If they would take --
(The men go back to their golf cart discussion. Cut to the women's steam room. Rory listens to the gossip.)
WOMAN #1: And you know she took the house.
WOMAN #2: She deserved it -- putting up with that tramp all those years.
WOMAN #1: Last year, Christmas, he bough them both the same bracelet.
WOMAN #2: She should have just sh*t him like his first wife did.
WOMAN #1: Oh I love Janie. Is she out yet?
(Gloria enters.)
GLORIA: Nanette, Peg.
WOMAN #1: Gloria, hi. Good game?
GLORIA: Not bad, you?
WOMAN #1: Oh, I just came for the steam. We must get together and play sometime soon.
GLORIA: Next week?
WOMAN #1: I'll call you.
(Gloria moves to a different area.)
WOMAN #1: (whispering) The most odious woman alive.



(Cut to the inn. The staff is still decorating for the wedding.)
LORELAI: OK, I need more tulle here. I need the feeling of a major tutu, OK? Oh, uh, hey, Gary, Gary! The ribbons go on the chairs, OK, not on the trees. Oh, great!
(Lorelai hears swans and goes down to meet the truck.)
LORELAI: Hey!
SWAN GUY: Where do you want the swans?
LORELAI: Well do you know where the pond is?
SWAN GUY: Nope.
LORELAI: You know that little road you came up?
SWAN GUY: Nope.
LORELAI: OK. Do you know how to say 'big help' in Chinese?
SWAN GUY: Nope.
LORELAI: Michel! (to Swan Guy) This is twenty swans?
SWAN GUY: Sure. Why not?
MICHEL: You screeched?
LORELAI: Yeah. I need you to show this guy where to put the swans.
MICHEL: Absolutely not.
LORELAI: Well I can't leave, OK? I've got a major tulle festival going on out here.
MICHEL: I will never go near those filthy birds.
LORELAI: Why?
MICHEL: I hate the swans.
LORELAI: These particular swans?
MICHEL: No, all swans. I was attacked by a band of swans in the Luxembourg Gardens when I was a boy. No one forgets that.
LORELAI: (laughing) Oh no -- not being attacked by a band of swans. Was it an all-boy band? Kind of a scary, feathery 'N Sync kind of fiasco?
MICHEL: This is not funny.
LORELAI: No, I'm sorry, it's not. It's not funny at all.
(The swans honk and Michel jumps.)
LORELAI: (laughing) Oh my God! Come on, you have to admit, that's a little funny.
DRELLA: Hey, Pepe le Pew, you wanna give me a hand with this?
MICHEL: No.
LORELAI: Listen, it's Drella or the swans.
MICHEL: So either one beast of terror or another?
DRELLA: What the hell is he babbling about?
MICHEL: (quietly, to Lorelai) Don't --
LORELAI: He's afraid of the swans.
MICHEL: (quietly) Thank you.
DRELLA: Of course he is. He's French.
LORELAI: Mmm.
MICHEL: (to Swan Guy) OK, I'll take you to the pond.
LORELAI: Thank you.
MICHEL: But stay far away from me.
(Drella watches as Michel leads Swan Guy away.)
DRELLA: Can't stand the talk -- love to watch the walk.
(Cut to the dining room at the country club.)
RORY: She caught him in the pool house with the tennis pro, not the riding instructor.
RICHARD: I had no idea.
RORY: That committee of yours is not looking at people as much as you think.
RICHARD: Why would they? From what you've told me they're all involved in one nefarious activity after another.
RORY: It's a conspiracy.
RICHARD: It's Peyton Place. Is there more?
RORY: Can you handle it?
RICHARD: I'll steel myself.
RORY: OK, Mr. Neville likes all things frilly.
RICHARD: Good God. He's my broker.
RORY: I don't think one will affect the other.
(Man #1 and Man #2 or 3 approach the table.)
MAN #1: Mind if we barge in?
RICHARD: Look who's here. Ah, Rory, this is Julian Johnson (MAN #1) and Edward James (MAN #2 or 3)
EDWARD: Call me "Ed".
JULIAN: You can call me "Ed" too.
(The two men laugh.)
RORY: It's nice to meet you.
RICHARD: Would you like to join us?
EDWARD: If Rory doesn't mind us intruding on her time with her grandfather.
RORY: No, that's fine.
JULIAN: Oh that's good. So, we hear you're attending Chilton.
RORY: I just started.
JULIAN: That's a hard school.
RORY: Yes sir.
RICHARD: Rory is an excellent student.
JULIAN: Really?
RICHARD: 4.0 grade point average.
JULIAN: Whoa! That's got me b*at.
(Edward and Julian laugh.)
RICHARD: She's going to Fez someday.
JULIAN: Fez? What the hell is in Fez?
RICHARD: That's for her to find out.
(Cut to Luke's. Rory is waiting for Luke.)
LUKE: Interesting hat.
RORY: I went golfing with my grandfather today.
LUKE: Did you know that golf courses are an environmental blight because of the chemicals they use to keep the grass green?
RORY: Actually I did. (silence) Bad joke, sorry.
(Luke walks away just before Lorelai comes in the door.)
LORELAI: My God -- this day. The swans, the tulle, my head...Luke, I need the largest cheeseburger in the world. Let's break a record here, mister. (to Rory) So, the wedding is a nightmare. We got these ten boxes of creepy larvae that are supposed to swarm into beautiful butterflies on the wedding day. They swarmed a little early! What's with the hat?
RORY: Grandma gave it to me.
LORELAI: Oh, now, that's just mean.
RORY: It's not that bad.
LORELAI: Do you want a mirror?
(Rory takes off the hat.)
LORELAI: So, Rory's golfing adventure. Tell me!
RORY: It was fine.
LORELAI: Oh, honey, I brought you some of Sookie's chocolate cake to make you feel better.
RORY: It really wasnt't that bad.
LORELAI: You are the sweetest kid in the whole world. Where on earth did you get that from? Luke, am I mistaken or did that sign on the door say "open"? (to Rory) So, where were we?
RORY: Me golfing.
LORELAI: Right -- go.
RORY: OK, well, uh, by the end of the day I could even hit the ball. Sometimes it wasn't my ball but the intentions were good.
LORELAI: Well good intentions and no physical exertion whatsoever is what the game of golf was built on. So, um, did you order?
RORY: I'm not hungry. I had a big lunch at the club.
LUKE: With all the other devastators of our land.
LORELAI: You had a big lunch at the club?
RORY: Yes, it was quite good.
LORELAI: Quite? What's with the quite?
RORY: What do you mean?
LORELAI: You don't ever say quite.
RORY: I've said quite plenty of times.
LORELAI: Whatever. So besides the "quite good" lunch you had, what else happened?
RORY: Nothing. We played, I met his friends, I took a steam.
LORELAI: You took a steam?
RORY: Yeah. I sweated out all my toxins and I stole a towel.
LORELAI: Wow! Sounds like you really had a good time.
RORY: I did.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Really.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Really.
LORELAI: Really.
RORY: OK, new word now.
LORELAI: Sorry -- I just -- I'm surprised. I thought you were gonna be bored.
RORY: I was kind of surprised too. I don't know -- it was pretty there and Grandpa and I talked a lot.
LORELAI: You talked? Really?
RORY: You're doing it again.
LORELAI: Sorry. You talked?
RORY: We talked about Fez.
LORELAI: And he thought it was a hat.
RORY: I told him about our backpacking trip. He thought it was a great idea.
LORELAI: Wow. So you really had fun.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: That's great.
(Luke serves Lorelai's cheeseburger.)
LORELAI: That is really, really great.
LUKE: I thought you were starving.
LORELAI: Things change. Move on.
RORY: Does this hat really look bad on me?
(Rory puts the hat back on.)
LORELAI: No. I think it looks kind of cute.
(Cut to the lawn at the inn. Miss Patty is teaching the twin couples to dance.)
MISS PATTY: It's your wedding day. Feel each other. Use the thumping of your heart as a metronome. Let passion be your coreographer. Be as light on your toes as you are in your hearts. No, no, no, no darling. Let me show you.
(Miss Patty pulls one couple apart and begins dancing with the groom.)
MISS PATTY: You know, in some countries if you dance this close you're cheating on your wife.
MATT (or MARK): You're next.
MARK (or MATT): Take your time.
(Lorelai goes inside the inn to where Rory is working. The phone is ringing.)
LORELAI: Hey. Oh my God, you have good handwriting.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You did not get that from me. You got your fabulous flair from me.
RORY: I also got my deviated septum from you.
LORELAI: Hey, focus on the flair.
MICHEL: It's for you. He says he's your father although why he'd volunteer that freely, I do not know.
LORELAI: My father?
MICHEL: Yes.
LORELAI: Are you sure?
MICHEL: Please just take the phone.
LORELAI: (takes phone) Dad? (pause) Yeah it's Lorelai -- who else calls you "Dad"? (pause) Yeah she's right here. Hold on. (to Rory) It's for you.
RORY: Thanks. (takes phone) Hello? (pause) Hey Grandpa...
(Lorelai watches as Rory moves away.)
RORY: That's great.
(Mrs. Shales and Drella come into the room.)
MRS. SHALES: Jackie wants Samuel Barber, John Cage, and Philip Glass and Jessica wants Shania Twain's "I Feel Like a Woman."
DRELLA: I'm not a jukebox.
MRS. SHALES: Oh please.
DRELLA: Hey, you think I started playing the harp 'cause I thought it would make me cool? You know, finally get me in with the in-crowd? Maybe I'd make for some great happy hour conversation. No, alright. The music drives me, lady. I will play what I feel and you will love it.
MRS. SHALES: I'll give you an extra $100.
DRELLA: You just got yourself a jukebox.
(They walk away. Lorelai is still watching Rory talk on the phone.)
RORY: Yeah, yeah, I'd love to see it. (pause) No, if you want to. (pause) Sure. That sounds good. (pause) Yeah.
(Cut to Lorelai's house. She and Rory are sitting outside. Rory is looking in a handheld mirror while Lorelai reads.)
LORELAI: Should I leave you two alone?
RORY: I think I want to change my hair.
LORELAI: Really? I think it looks quite good.
RORY: You're funny. Do you want something to drink?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, water.
(Rory goes inside.)
LORELAI: So you talk to Grandpa today?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Grandpa -- he called?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Anything wrong?
(Rory returns to the porch.)
RORY: No. He just found this book we were talking about.
LORELAI: Oh. And he just called to tell you?
RORY: Yeah, why?
LORELAI: Nothing. It's just weird. He doesn't call the inn that much. Or ever, actually.
RORY: Well he knew that I was looking for it, so --
LORELAI: Oh, sure. What book was it?
RORY: Mencken's "Chrestomathy"
LORELAI: Oh, that one.
RORY: Yeah.
(Babette comes running up on the porch.)
BABETTE: Hey! Cinnamon is stuck under the front porch again. Can I borrow some vegetable oil and a shoehorn?
RORY: I'll get it. (leaves)
BABETTE: I'm callin' him and I'm callin' him and I go around the porch and this big orange tush is just starin' me in the face.
LORELAI: I hate when that happens.
BABETTE: Yeah. He must've been meowin' for an hour but Morey was playing some Thelonious on the Steinway and when Morey plays I go into this trance where all I can see is blue and moon and stars --
(They hear a loud angry meow.)
MOREY: He's out Babs!
BABETTE: Oh! Never mind, Sugar. (calls to Morey) Play me home, baby!
(Piano music starts. Babette gets up to go home.)
LORELAI: Bye.
BABETTE: Oh God! It's k*ll me!
(Rory comes back out with vegetable oil.)
RORY: Babette didn't take her oil.
LORELAI: Oh, keep it. Christmas is early this year. So you know what I was thinking?
RORY: That Madonna and Sean Penn should get remarried?
LORELAI: Besides that. I was thinking that your golfing expedition should totally count as a dinner.
RORY: What do you mean?
LORELAI: I mean I think I can get us out of dinner at the grandparents' on Friday. Maybe we could grab a movie.
RORY: Oh, well, that's OK.
LORELAI: It's no big deal, really.
RORY: No. It's just gonna get Grandma all freaked out.
LORELAI: Yeah but I can handle those freakouts. I've done that.
RORY: You know, I have to get the book from Grandpa anyway. Let's just go.
LORELAI: Oh. All right. If you really want to.
RORY: I do.
LORELAI: OK, fine. Is that my sweater?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You're wearing my sweater.
RORY: So?
LORELAI: No, it's OK. It's just I thought I asked you to at least ask, you know, before you borrow my stuff.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: It's OK. It's just not too much for a simple "Can I borrow it, Mom?" is it?
RORY: No, it's not. Jeez, lighten up.
LORELAI: It's my favorite sweater too.
RORY: Since when?
LORELAI: Since always.
RORY: This is not your favorite sweater.
LORELAI: Yes it is and now it's going to be all stretched out just like everything else you borrow.
RORY: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: I'm talking about that you take my sweaters and you wear them and you stretch them out.
RORY: I couldn't possibly stretch them out! Your boobs are way bigger than mine.
LORELAI: That is not true.
RORY: Yes it is.
LORELAI: Your boobs are totally bigger than mine!
RORY: You're crazy!
LORELAI: Do you want to measure?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I'm serious. Why don't you get the measuring tape right now?
RORY: I am not going to measure my boobs.
LORELAI: Because you know that you are totally bigger.
RORY: I'm going inside.
LORELAI: Fine, don't measure. We'll just compare bras.
RORY:Stop it!
LORELAI: I'll stop when you quit stealing my stuff.
RORY: You're cracked!
LORELAI: You're...bigger.
(Rory takes her books and slams the door as she goes inside.)
(Cut to Lorelai and Sookie walking down the street.)
LORELAI: "Your boobs are bigger than mine"? I'm a mental case.
SOOKIE: So apologize.
LORELAI: I was too mad and stupid to apologize last night and she was gone before I got up this morning. What is wrong with me?
SOOKIE: You're very possessive of your sweaters.
LORELAI: Sookie.
SOOKIE: No, I understand. I'm the same way. If somebody breathes too hard on my paring knife I'm like a crazy spider monkey.
LORELAI: It's not about the sweater. It's about the golfing thing and the liking it thing. She had fun, Sookie. Just like my mother said she would.
SOOKIE: Yeah, that's got to hurt.
LORELAI: She should have fun. I mean, I want her to have a good relationship with her grandparents. Just because I don't doesn't mean she shouldn't, right?
SOOKIE: Right.
LORELAI: Right. So then why was I trying to get her out of Friday night dinner? I mean, what am I trying to do -- undermine their relationship?
SOOKIE: No you weren't.
LORELAI: Yes I was.
SOOKIE: Yes you were.
LORELAI: Yes! I'm four years old!
SOOKIE: You're jealous.
LORELAI: Oh I'm not jealous.
SOOKIE: Yeah, you are. You're jealous 'cause they like Rory better than you.
LORELAI: Oh thank you for the hug.
SOOKIE: See, I'm bad at advice talks. Could we talk about soup? 'Cause I'm good with soup.
LORELAI: Oh I'm sorry. You're fine. I'm all mixed up. I left that life, you know, the club, my parents. I ran from it as soon as I could. It just -- it never occurred to me that she might want it. It occurred to my mother though. God, I hate that she was right.
SOOKIE: You don't know that she -- ooh! Oh my God!
(Sookie spots something across the street. Without looking to see if any cars are coming she crosses the street, causing a guy to fall off his bike to avoid hitting her.)
BIKE GUY: Hey, watch it!
LORELAI: Oh! Aah! (to Bike Guy) Are you OK? OK.
(Lorelai looks both ways before crossing the street to catch up to Sookie.)
SOOKIE: (to strawberries) Look at you! You're beautiful!
LORELAI: I have to be more adult about this. I mean, if the country club life is what she wants, more power to her, right? You know, little white gloves and coming-out parties. That makes some girls happy, right?
SOOKIE: (while admiring the strawberries) Sure, yeah. If they're on Prozac, absolutely.
LORELAI: I just never thought that I'd raise that kind of kid, you know? I mean, not that there's anything wrong with that kind of kid. I just never thought that was Rory. Maybe it's not. I don't know. Am I obsessing? Sookie? Hello? Do I have to put on my strawberry costume to get your full attention?
SOOKIE: No, I'm sorry. You have a strawberry costume?
(Jackson walks by and sees Sookie)
JACKSON: Unbelievable!
SOOKIE: Jackson!
JACKSON: So this is what we've come to? You sneaking around behind my back buying somebody else's strawberries?
SOOKIE: I was desperate!
JACKSON: You disgust me!
SOOKIE: I needed the strawberries!
JACKSON: Well now you have 'em. I hope you're happy together.
SOOKIE: Jackson -- wait!
JACKSON: No!
(Jackson walks away. Sookie follows him.)
SOOKIE: Come on Jackson.
JACKSON: No.
SOOKIE: Jackson, we can talk about it.
JACKSON: No.
SOOKIE: Jackson, get back here!
JACKSON: Get away from me!
(Sookie chases him down the middle of the street where they almost get hit by a car.)
(Cut to the wedding reception at the inn. Everyone is dancing. Mrs. Shales hugs Lorelai.)
MRS. SHALES: We did it!
LORELAI: We sure did.
MRS. SHALES: God, I feel wonderful.
LORELAI: I'm so glad it turned out the way you wanted it.
MRS. SHALES: Oh, you have no idea. They just told me they're going to share a condo in Tuscon. Arizona! That's hundreds of miles away!
LORELAI: Congratulations.
MRS. SHALES: Oh, thank you. Sister Sledge! Excuse me.
(Mrs. Shales runs off to dance. Lorelai walks over to where Rory is sitting with the guestbook.)
LORELAI: Hey, stranger.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Good turnout?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: Do you want something to drink?
RORY: Are you trying to make up?
LORELAI: No, I'm trying to hydrate you.
RORY: I'm fine, thanks.
LORELAI: I'm sorry.
RORY: It's OK.
LORELAI: A crazy evil spirit obsessed with bra size took over my body.
RORY: It happens.
LORELAI: She's gone now.
RORY: Good to know.
LORELAI: You know, I'm glad you're bonding with your grandparents.
RORY: No you're not.
LORELAI: Yes I am. It's just weird for me is all. I just can't relate to it.
RORY: You could if you tried.
LORELAI: No, we're too -- too much has happened and I'm glad you are anyway.
RORY: OK.
LORELAI: I didn't mean to cut you off from them so completely, you know. It just happened. Not having them in my life just felt so right. I just never thought -- I'm sorry.
IRATE MOTHER: (to her daughter) I did not pay $500 for this dress so you could run around and mess it up. Now you sit and be still. Cross your legs. You're a lady.
LORELAI: God, I must have had a million dresses like that when I was a kid.
RORY: It doesn't really scream "you."
LORELAI: No. I did all the screaming.
RORY: Thank you for not putting me in a dress like that.
LORELAI: You're welcome. Of course wearing those dresses -- not all bad.
RORY: No?
LORELAI: Oh no. They really fly up when you twirl around.
RORY: Huh.
LORELAI: And if you're wearing that ruffled underwear -- big crowd pleaser.
RORY: If it makes you feel better, I think I got a fungus from the steam room.
LORELAI: It does. Thank you.
(Cut to Emily and Richard's house. Rory and Lorelai are just arriving.)
EMILY: Oh, good, you're here.
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: Hi, Grandma.
EMILY: My goodnes, what is that?
LORELAI: We brought dessert.
EMILY: Really? How thoughtful. What is it?
LORELAI: Blueberry shortcake.
EMILY: I've never heard of blueberry shortcake.
LORELAI: Yeah, it's a Stars Hollow specialty.
EMILY: Why is it already cut?
LORELAI: It's left over. From the wedding. At the inn.
EMILY: Yes, I know where the wedding was.
LORELAI: Oh, sorry. You were just doing that staring thing.
EMILY: You brought us used dessert?
LORELAI: It's not used. It's left over.
EMILY: How nice. I'll just put it in the kitchen next to my half-empty box of Cheer.
LORELAI: (whispers to Rory) She's in a good mood tonight.
EMILY: Can I get you a drink?
LORELAI: Uh, white wine would be nice.
RORY: Coke.
EMILY: So, Lorelai, did Rory tell you all about the wonderful time she had at the club?
LORELAI: She sure did.
EMILY: Your father was simply flying all week. She really charmed him.
LORELAI: Ah, well, if anybody could, it would be her.
EMILY: I mean, in this age of MTV and 100 television channels who would've imagined that a young girl coul still get a thrill spending a simple afternoon with her grandfather?
LORELAI: That wine would be real good right now, Mom.
EMILY: I think we should consider getting her a membership at the club, don't you?
LORELAI: If she wants, sure.
EMILY: I mean, to have a place to go where she can socialize, that's very important to a young girl.
LORELAI: Well, now especially that the crack den is closed down on the corner all her really good friends are gone. What do you think, Mom, should I pursue the career in comedy?
EMILY: It's just very interesting the way things turn out, isn't it?
(Richard comes in.)
RICHARD: Oh, you're here. Lorelai.
LORELAI: Dad.
RICHARD: Rory, I have a surprise. Not only did I find that copy of Mencken's "Chrestomathy" we discussed, I also found a first edition of his memoirs as well.
RORY: You're kidding?
RICHARD: It's in my office if you'd like to see them.
RORY: Oh my God, I totally would.
EMIL:Y I'd like to take a look at those myself.
(They leave Lorelai sitting alone in the room.)

CUT TO RORY AND LORELAI WALKING ACROSS THE STREET.
LORELAI: Shopping for school supplies - party.
RORY: Nobody demanded that you come.
LORELAI: Are you kidding? How of ten do you get to do things like this? I was thinking, while we're going crazy, we should get some toilet paper and a plunger next.
RORY: I'll just do this later.
LORELAI: No, I'm teasing. Come on, get that list of your.
RORY: Ok [puts out a list] I need legal pads,
LORELAI: Got it.
RORY: Tons of pens,
LORELAI: Right.
RORY: Some number 2 pencils, three highlighters, an eraser a staple remover and a folder.
LORELAI: You need 3 highlighters?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Three?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: That's a very random number.
RORY: Three is not a random number.
LORELAI: No but I mean how did you get to the number 3?
RORY: One dries up, one gets lost, I have one left.
LORELAI: You have really thought this out.
RORY: Yes, I have.
LORELAI: What came first - the chicken or the egg.
RORY: Can we get back to this list please.
LORELAI: Alright. Ooh, hey, legal pads.
RORY: No. Those are purple.
LORELAI: Yes, purple is festive.
RORY: I can't have purple
LORELAI: Yes you can, they're on sale.
RORY: I'm going to a serious school now, I need serious paper.
LORELAI: Paper's paper.
RORY: Not at Chilton.
LORELAI: Alright, fine. Here is your serious paper.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Ooh and here are you somber highlighters, your maudlin pencils, your manic-depressive pens.
RORY: Mom
LORELAI: Now these erasers are on lithium so they may seem cheerful but we actually caught them trying to shove themselves in the pencil sharpener earlier.
RORY: I'm going home now.
LORELAI: No wait! We're going to stage an intervention with the neon post-its and make them give up their wacky crazy ways.
RORY: You're never coming shopping with me again.
LORELAI: Ooh here's a card tray - [fades into intro]
CUT TO BUS OUTSIDE CHILTON
[Rory gets off the bus with bags, runs back into the bus for two more bags, then runs back into the bus a third time for another two.
CUT TO MR. MEDINA'S CLASSROOM
MAX: Decent effort by most [handing back tests] Good effort by some, exceptional effort by two. Miss Geller, Miss Grant. Ms. Graham. Miss Gilmore [ hands Rory her paper with a D'] Take these home, learn from your mistakes. Look at the large red circles around various parts of your paper as friendly reminders that to err is human. And that here at Chilton we try to b*at that humanity right outta ya! Ok, next up. The test - the dreaded test. Shakespeare! The man we've been droning on about for the last three weeks, finally comes back to haunt us on Friday. This is a big one my friends - multiple choice with an essay section that will count for 20% of your grade for this semester. And don't be fooled by my kind face and charming personality. This test will be hard, and there will be no makeups. [bell rings] Refer to the study materials that I gave you at the beginning of the month and those extensive notes I know you've been taking.
PARIS: Hard paper.
LOUISE: k*ll.
PARIS: How'd you do?
LOUISE: A'
PARIS: Me too.
LOUISE: Oh small world.
PARIS: Isn't it? Madeline what'd you get?
MADELINE: You know I got a B'
PARIS: A B's not bad.
LOUISE: Oh not at all.
PARIS: Respectable even
LOUISE: I'd be proud.
PARIS: A D' however, that would be cause for concern.
LOUISE: A cry for help.
PARIS: A job application at McDonald's.
LOUISE: Would you like fries with that?
PARIS: Hey, you know, not everybody can be smart. As my mother always says, somebody has to answer the phones.
MADELINE: Ok, I have no idea what you two are talking about.
PARIS: No, but Rory does. [as the three go in another direction]
TRISTAN: Hey Mary.
RORY: And it just keeps getting better.
TRISTAN: Oh you look sad.
RORY: I'm fine.
TRISTAN: Bad grade?
RORY: I have to go.
TRISTAN: You know what Mary, [stopping her] see I can't figure out why we're not friends. I think it's because I make you nervous.
RORY: I think it's because you can't learn my name.
TRISTAN: Do you have a boyfriend?
RORY: None of your business.
TRISTAN: Is that a no'?
RORY: Is there no one else at this school you can bother?
TRISTAN: See, I think you like me, you just don't know how to say it.
RORY: Oh boy.
TRISTAN: What are you doing Friday night?
RORY: I'm busy.
TRISTAN: What, you gotta be back at the convent by 5.
RORY: Please leave me alone.
TRISTAN: Well...since you said please [steps aside] Later...Mary.

[Drella runs her harp into Michel.]
MICHEL: Aah! You imbecil!
DRELLA: Back off chevalier.
MICHEL: You're stupid, blind and clumsy.
DRELLA: Well at least I'm not French.
LORELAI: Hey, what's going on?
MICHEL: She ran over my shoe.
DRELLA: He got in the way.
MICHEL: You aimed for me.
DRELLA: Yeah well.
LORELAI: Ok, hold on.
MICHEL: She scratched my shoes.
DRELLA: What a baby.
MICHEL: These are $300 Italian loafers.
DRELLA: Wonder if Versace makes a pacifier.
MICHEL: You're fired.
LORELAI: Excuse me?
DRELLA: You can't fire me.
MICHEL: Then I dock your pay.
LORELAI: Alright.
MICHEL: Can I k*ll her.
LORELAI: Not before high tea.
MICHEL: Fine, then I will curse you constantly and in several languages.
DRELLA: Going for the other foot.
LORELAI: Oh no! Drella, to your corner now [Drella leaves]
MICHEL: I win.
LORELAI: Michel you're a grown man, now go to your desk and act like one.
[Lorelai r*fles through mail]
LORELAI: Oh my God! [goes to kitchen]
LORELAI: Sookie, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Ok, ok, just a minute.
LORELAI: I've got it.
SOOKIE: The review?
LORELAI: It's here.
SOOKIE: Ooh, where it is?
LORELAI: I'm looking.
[Rory enters with tons of bags]
LORELAI: Oh, behold in theaters now, the thing that reads a lot
[Rory drops all the bags at once]
RORY: Chocolate?
SOOKIE: Glass measuring cup. Lorelai look, look.
LORELAI: I'm sorry.
RORY: Jeez, who's naked?
LORELAI: Uh, Lucent Mills - food critic.
RORY: Yeah? How's his butt?
LORELAI: Oh, no. He's supposed to do a review of the restaurant - oh, here it is.
SOOKIE: Is it - its it good? Is he mean, should I cry?
LORELAI: Here we go. The words divine, delectable and delirious don't begin to describe the delicious experience of dining at the Independence Inn.' Oh I'm smelling rave!
SOOKIE: Really?
LORELAI: Only chef Sookie St. James can make a simple salad of hot house tomatoes and assorted fresh herbs seem like a religious experience. Her lobster bisque is worth every sinful cream filled rich sip'
SOOKIE: See I don't use that much cream. I just use a very concentrated lobster stock and it really makes it -
LORELAI: Sookie, he's not here.
SOOKIE: Ok, go on.
LORELAI: The entrees are as heavenly as the starters. Though the much lauded risotto was perfectly fine, it was the simple handkerchief pasta with brown sage in a butter sauce that sent me through the roof' Sookie this is unbelievable! I'm going to have this framed for the dining room!
SOOKIE: Oh, yeah. That'd be swell. Can I see that again?
LORELAI: Yeah. So we should celebrate huh? [doing a little twisty dance step towards Rory] Girls on the town?
RORY: I can't. I have to study.
SOOKIE: You know I should really get started on this shopping list.
LORELAI: What is going on here? We are young and fiery women. Studying? Shopping lists? Where's to hell with it all'? Where's Throwing caution to the wind'? Where's - oh sh**t - the linen delivery [leaves]
RORY: You go girl.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
LORELAI: News is on.
RORY: One sec.
LORELAI: [to herself]For our top story tonight, a grisly horrible thing that happened in a small town where not grisly horrible things ever happen. Everyone's shocked. House slides down hill. Liposuction k*ll, stay fat. [turns off tv] Hey let's get ice cream. I'm bored. [goes into kitchen where Rory is studying] Hello?
RORY: Mom, I'm studying.
LORELAI: Yeah, but I'm talking ice cream. Can't you take a break?
RORY: I can't take a break right now.
LORELAI: Ok, when?
RORY: Are you four?
LORELAI: No, I'm hungry!
RORY: Have some more pizza.
LORELAI: It's cold.
RORY: Heat it up.
LORELAI: It's not the same.
RORY: Lorelai go to your room!
LORELAI: Wow, smart girls are mean.
RORY: If you let me study now, I'll play with you this weekend.
LORELAI: Promise.
RORY: Yes, we can do anything you want.
LORELAI: Will you go to the shoe sale with me.
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Will you let me try on anything I want.
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Will you help me push other people out of the way if they're going for my size?
RORY: I'll even run interference for you.
LORELAI: Alright, you've got a deal. [leaves kitchen]
RORY: Good.
LORELAI: [comes back in] So - I'm sorry - where did we land on the whole ice cream issue?
[Rory gets up and goes to her room]
LORELAI: What?
CUT TO RORY ON HER WAY TO LANE'S
[enters house]
RORY: Lane?!
LANE: Rory?!
RORY: Right or left?!
LANE: Left!
[Rory goes left]
RORY: I thought you said left!
LANE: Sorry - my left, your right!
RORY: Ok. Marco...
LANE: Polo!
RORY: Marco
LANE: Polo!
RORY: Hey Marco.
LANE: Hey Polo, you're late.
RORY: Sorry. What is that?
LANE: 12 calories.
RORY: Here [gives her a snickers]
LANE: Oh my God bless you!
[Rory pulls out a big binder]
LANE: Man, what's that?
RORY: My notes.
LANE: Really?
RORY: I don't think Shakespeare knew himself this well
WOMAN: Ooh, I like, how much?
MRS. KIM: $500
WOMAN: Is that the best you can do?
MRS. KIM: $450
WOMAN: I'm not so sure [turns to leave]
MRS. KIM: $375 and you take it right now.
WOMAN: Sold
MRS. KIM: We appreciate your business. [to girls] Move.
RORY: [as they pack up their books] I really miss Stars Hollow High.
LANE: You're kidding right?
RORY: No. Chilton's just - I don't know, hard.
LANE: What do you care? You were always miss everything-so-easy-at-school. This should be a snap for you.
[They start to put their books down on a table]
MRS. KIM: No, this is sold. Move. What's that? [at snickers]
RORY: Oh, that's mine.
MRS. KIM: That is chocolate covered death.
RORY: With a creamy caramel surprise.
[they move again]
LANE: Um, so this guy asked about you today.
RORY: What guy?
LANE: The new kid - tall, perfect.
RORY: What'd he want to know?
LANE: Where you were.
RORY: Well what'd you say?
LANE: Oh I told him you were just too smart for us and that you had to go to the genius school.
RORY: Oh.
LANE: He really like that. I guess he must be into brainy chicks.
RORY: Well I'll keep my eyes open for one for him. [putting stuff down on another table]
MRS. KIM: No - sold.
LANE: Mom.
MRS. KIM: Move.
LANE: Well where do you want us to go?
MRS. KIM: Library.
LANE: I hate sales!
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Drella is playing the harp]
LORELAI: No Black Sabbath.
DRELLA: No one is listening.
LORELAI: No Black Sabbath, no Steely Dan, no Boston and no Queen.
DRELLA: What happened to make you so cold?
LORELAI: We like that Mozart [heads towards the kitchen.]
DRELLA: I am the Artie Shaw of harpists.
[Lorelai enters kitchen]
LORELAI: Sookie, I need coffee to go.
SOOKIE: [holding her head in her hands] There's fresh over there.
LORELAI: Ooh, good. [picks up an empty pot] Fresh in my first lifetime as Joan of Arc.
SOOKIE: Oh sorry. I thought I made fresh. Here. [pours water]
LORELAI: Bless you. I'm so exhausted and I have to drive into Hartford tonight to go to a parent/teacher meeting.
SOOKIE: [sadly] Sounds great.
LORELAI: Yeah. This school is so different from Stars Hollow you know. They send home like a thousand pages of updates every week. It's a very intense place.
SOOKIE: Uh - huh.
LORELAI: Last week there was a huge debate over whether plaid scrunchies were acceptable head wear. People took sides, things got ugly, the scrunchie motion finally passed and I'd like to think I was the tie breaker.
SOOKIE: That's nice.
LORELAI: Hey, what's the matter sweetie?
SOOKIE: He said it was fine.
LORELAI: Who said it was fine.
SOOKIE: Lucent Mills.
LORELAI: The restaurant critic.
SOOKIE: He said my risotto was fine.
LORELAI: Well isn't it?
SOOKIE: No it's not fine. Fine is a word you use when someone stops you on the street that you sort of know but you don't wanna talk to, so they ask you how you are and you say fine and that's just enough so they don't have to keep talking because they don't want to. And then they can feel good about themselves because they've been considerate enough to ask and then if God forbid something actually is wrong they'll actually sit down and take the time to listen, even though they don't want to.
LORELAI: Sweetie, I don't think he meant fine' as a slam or as a monologue.
SOOKIE: He couldn't have meant it any other way.
LORELAI: Sookie, I hate to see you get so upset over one little review.
SOOKIE: This is pride Lorelai. I mean you know about this risotto. I mean on my mother's deathbed -
LORELAI: You made the risotto and she lived three more years.
SOOKIE: She was supposed to be dead. The doctor said she wouldn't make it through the night.
LORELAI: And she lived because of the risotto - the magic risotto.
SOOKIE: And this guy had the nerve to say it was fine'
LORELAI: I don't think he knew the story.
SOOKIE: Urgh! [Jackson comes in]
JACKSON: Ok, now before you get all goofy on me, I don't have your procini's. I forgot them. I don't have any other excuse other than plain old stupid human error. And I have the morels, which I know you don't want. So come on - let me have it.
SOOKIE: Morels are fine.
JACKSON: [putting box down] Did anyone else feel the shift in the space-time continuum?
LORELAI: A reviewer didn't like the risotto.
JACKSON: The magic risotto? You're kidding.
LORELAI: Well, I gotta go, so try and cheer her up would you?
JACKSON: Uh sure.
LORELAI: [to Sookie] Sweetie please don't worry about it. Everyone knows you're the best.
JACKSON: So, I hear the huckleberry crops are gonna totally suck this year!
[Sookie just looks at him.]
CUT TO CHILTON
MAX: We are gonna be focusing on Elizabethan literature. Shakespeare, Marlowe, Bacon, Ben Jonson, John Webster -
DAD #1: Yeah, is Marlowe really that significant?
MAX: Well we wanna give as complete an overview as possible.
MOM #1: Yes but will he be included on the Advance Placement test?
MAX: Well we can't know exactly what will be on the AP test, but it will definitely be important for future studies when your kids hit their universities.
DAD #1: But to get there, they need to pass the AP test.
MAX: Right, well it's all important and it could all be on the test.
MOM #2: How do we find out?
MAX: Well you can bribe somebody on the AP committee [parents start to discuss amongst themselves]
MAX: I was just kidding. I'm just kidding.
[Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: I'm so sorry. I had this terrible pot hole incident. And - you don't care. Please go on. [walks into globe]
MAX: Whoa, whoa.
LORELAI: What in the world? [attempt at a joke that no one laughs at]
MAX: You ok?
LORELAI: Uh huh. I'll just sit now.
MAX: I don't think we've met.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm Lorelai Gilmore - Rory's mom.
MAX: Glad you could join us. [to parents] Rory is one of our new students.
MOM #1: How nice. Now the AP test -
MAX: Right well, we are preparing them as best we can [Lorelai serving herself some coffee]
MOM: I've hired a tutor for Bethany.
MAX: Always a valid option.
LORELAI: Mmm. Jesus, Mary, Joseph and a camel [whispers] This is really bad coffee. [louder] So this AP test, what are we going to do about it huh?
MAX: Well the next test is scheduled for next month, um, the 25th, Saturday at 7:00 am. [Lorelai raises her hand] Ms. Gilmore?
LORELAI: Uh, where is the test?
MAX: It will be given here.
LORELAI: Here.
MAX: Right.
LORELAI: Great.
MAX: Great, any other questions?
LORELAI: Yeah, um, can parents come?
MOM #1: What?!
LORELAI: Yeah, it's a big exciting test. I just thought - I'm sorry is that stupid?
MAX: No it's not stupid.
LORELAI: I just thought I'd like to see the excitement.
DAD #2: It's a test.
LORELAI: Yeah I know.
DAD #2: What's exciting about a test?
LORELAI: Do you play golf?
DAD #2: Yes I do.
LORELAI: You explain yours, I'll explain mine.
MAX: Ok, why don't we get back to the meeting.
MOM #1 [to Mom #2] That's the one who voted for the scrunchies.
MOM #2: Must be a scholarship student.
LORELAI: Um excuse me -
MAX: You know, I think this would be a good time for a break. There's coffee in the back.
[Lorelai stand up by the black board]
MAX: What were you gonna do - hit her?
LORELAI: No, I just - I had some good verbal comebacks ready.
[sips coffee]
LORELAI: It - it just keeps getting worse.
MAX: Well you know not drinking it is always an option.
LORELAI: Not in my world.
MAX: I'm Max Medina.
LORELAI: Nice to meet you.
MAX: I apologize for the behaviors of some of our guests tonight. It's a tense time for some people.
LORELAI: The SAT season?
MAX: The waking hours. [Lorelai giggles]
LORELAI: Hey, are you this nice to my kid?
MAX: Yeah, it's easy. Rory's a sweet girl.
LORELAI: Yeah she is, she is.
MAX: [pulling her aside] How is she liking Chilton?
LORELAI: Oh, she loves it.
MAX: Really?
LORELAI: Oh yeah. I mean it's an adjustment of course, but she's always wanted to go to Harvard and this is how she'll get there.
MAX: Harvard?
LORELAI: Yeah. Ever since she could crawl, I've really wanted her to go there.
MAX: It's a great school.
LORELAI: I actually bought her a Harvard sweatshirt when she was 4, which of course was way too big for her, so she used it as a blanket for a while and then as a make shift diaper on this really ill-fated shopping trip and now I've told you a story that would so mortify her, she'll k*ll me when she finds out you know.
MAX: Don't tell her then. It'll be our secret.
LORELAI: Well I appreciate that.
MAX: So are you a B-52's girl?
LORELAI: What? [looks at her shirt and giggles] No, I'm a klutz girl who should not drive with a coffee in her hand. I, uh, had it in the car.
MAX: You know I hope Rory adjust to this place. We need her here.
LORELAI: Thank you. That's so nice.
MAX: And I hope she's not too disappointed about her paper. Because it's very hard to catch up on all that reading material. I know a D' seems pretty dismal -
LORELAI: Rory got a D'?
MAX: Yeah, but -
LORELAI: She's never gotten a D'.
MAX: It's the first paper she's had to turn in, she's bound to falter a little.
LORELAI: Oh man, this totally explains the no ice cream' thing. God I'm such and idiot!
MAX: The ice cream thing?
LORELAI: Look, I-I've gotta go.
MAX: Well I'm sorry if I've said something to offend you.
LORELAI: Oh no-no-no-no. It's just that if Rory got a D', she's not feeling too good right now and I'd really like to be there.
MAX: I understand.
LORELAI: So, it was nice meeting you.
MAX: You too.
LORELAI: Um, keep up the good work.
MAX: I will.
LORELAI: Don't ever make coffee ever again.
MAX: I won't I promise. Oh - [Lorelai almost walks into globe again.]
LORELAI: Oh, ha ha ha. Thanks. [grabs purse] Bye.
MAX: Bye.
CUT TO LUKE'S
[Rory's sitting at a table, tries to write but the tip of her pencil breaks. She throws it in frustration.]
LUKE: Here.
RORY: What's that?
LUKE: You look like you need pie.
RORY: I do?
LUKE: Violent pencil tossing usually signals the need for pie.
RORY: What if I'd thrown a pen?
LUKE: I would've brought you a trout.
RORY: What?
LUKE: I don't make the rules, I just carry them out.
[Lorelai comes in]
LORELAI: Hey, Backwards baseball hat - new look for you. [looks at Rory] She's eating pie? Did she even have dinner?
LUKE: You raised her, I just serve.
[Lorelai goes and sits with Rory]
LORELAI: Oh hello, bookworm.
RORY: Finally, where were you?
LORELAI: Well, um, actually I was in Hartford.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: I was there for the... [signals Rory to finish the sentence]
RORY: Parent/teacher meeting. Oh, my God. I forgot.
LORELAI: It went very well. I was extremely charming. I won the whole crowd over. They made me queen.
RORY: So I guess you talked to Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: Mm-hm. Why did you let me whine about ice cream and shoe sales when you had something major going on?
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: I hate when I'm an idiot and I don't even know it. I like to be aware of my idiocy - to really revel in it, take pictures. I feel we missed a prime Christmas card opportunity.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: You should've told me.
RORY: I couldn't.
LORELAI: You couldn't tell me? You tell me everything.
RORY: It was too humiliating.
LORELAI: Oh, honey, you once told me that you loved Saved by the Bell'. What could be more humiliating than that.?
RORY: I couldn't form the words. I couldn't even say it. I couldn't even comprehend it. It wasa D'. I got a D', I've never gotten a D' - ever.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Even when I broke my arm and couldn't write for a month, I still got an A-
LORELAI: That was a different school.
RORY: I know. It was Stars Hollow High. A D' at Stars Hollow is like an F' at Chilton. It's worse, it's like a G' or a W'.
LORELAI: So I'm guessing the spelling test didn't go well either?
RORY: A D'. I suck.
LORELAI: You don't suck.
RORY: I can't do this.
LORELAI: Listen, a D' is bad, ok. But all this talk about I suck' and I can't do this' and self pity - that's worse. That's not you. You didn't feel sorry for yourself when it took you three months to learn how to ride a bike, and you won't now.
RORY: Four months.
LORELAI: Huh?
RORY: It took me four months
LORELAI: Really? Four months?
RORY: Yeah, you wanna belabor the conversation?
LORELAI: Alright, forget about the bike. Listen, a D' is one grade. It's not the end of the world. You'll catch up, you'll do better. You are of hardy stubborn stock, my dear. If there's one thing I gave you, it's my stubbornness.
RORY: I'm not stubborn.
LORELAI: Yes you are.
RORY: No I'm not.
LORELAI: Fine you're not.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome. You can do this Rory and I will help you. I will get you through this, now put that D' behind you. Now what's next?
RORY: I have a test on Friday.
LORELAI: Ooh a test! Great!
RORY: It's on Shakespeare.
LORELAI: Bard with a beard - love it!
RORY: It's worth 20% of my grade.
LORELAI: Just makes life interesting. Now what do we have to do to get you an A' on that test.
RORY: Do you really think I can do this?
LORELAI: I bet you a dollar.
RORY: That's it? That's all my future's worth - one dollar.
LORELAI: Well you did get a D'.
[Rory chuckles]
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory is sitting on a bench reading. Paris comes up behind her]
PARIS: Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments, love is not love which alters when it alterations finds or bends with the remover to remove - oh no! It is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken. It is the star to every wandering bark who worth's unknown although his height be taken' You're going down.
CUT TO INN KITCHEN.
LORELAI: Hey, Sookie, do you know what the menu's gonna be - [ Sookie shoves risotto into her mouth]
SOOKIE: Good?
LORELAI: Hot.
SOOKIE: Wait, I got another one [shoves more into Lorelai's mouth.] Better?
LORELAI: Hotter!
SOOKIE: Wait, I got one more - one more [shoves more into her mouth again]
LORELAI: Sookie! What's with all the risotto? Have we gone theme' now? Ooh, is it gonna be like the scotch tape store?
SOOKIE: Look, I've made 40 recipes, ok, 40. And every single time I come back to the same conclusion.
LORELAI: That you're is better?
SOOKIE: Yes!
LORELAI: It is!
[Waiter, Brian, comes into the kitchen.]
BRIAN: You were looking for me?
SOOKIE: Yes, great! Three weeks ago, guy comes in, Lucent Mills, orders the risotto, doesn't like it.
BRIAN: The magic risotto? You're kidding.
LORELAI: Not helping.
SOOKIE: He's a restaurant critic. He ordered lots of things - probably didn't finish them. Now in his review he said his waiter had a goatee. Now you've got a goatee, and so you waited on him and I need info.
BRIAN: Well what did he look like?
SOOKIE: Like he's unhappy with the risotto! Or maybe he had an annoying table companion with him that wouldn't let him concentrate on what he was eating.
BRIAN: Well I serve a lot of people.
SOOKIE: He had a beard, or false teeth, or wig, or those glasses with a big nose.
BRIAN: [to Lorelai] May I be fired now?
LORELAI: Absolutely. [Brian leaves, Sookie follows]
SOOKIE: What about a guy with an annoying companion and a fake wig who was sitting underneath an air conditioning vent next to a woman with too much perfume on?!?



CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
LORELAI: The Comedy of Errors' - written?
RORY: 1590
LORELAI: Published?
RORY: 1698
LORELAI: Ooh 1623 - close
RORY: How is 1623 close?
LORELAI: You got the 16' part right.
RORY: I was off by 75 years
LORELAI: Well anything under 100 years is close.
RORY: What kind of rule is that?
LORELAI: I'm running the study session here. Ok. Richard III?
RORY: 1591
LORELAI: [Makes buzzer sound]
RORY: '93?
LORELAI: [Makes buzzer sound]
RORY: '96?
LORELAI: [Makes buzzer sound]
RORY: Ok, that's getting really annoying now
LORELAI: [Makes small buzzer sound]
[Pan to later the save evening]
[Lorelai comes into living room with coffee]
LORELAI: Go on, I'm listening.
RORY: The sonnets are 154 poems of 14 lines
LORELAI: Except?
RORY: Except for 126 which is 12 lines.
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: They are written in iambic pentameter.
LORELAI: Except?
RORY: Except 145 which is in tetrameter.
LORELAI: Rock on sister.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Not one mistake.
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: How do you feel?
RORY: Nauseous.
LORELAI: Yeah well, I don't think the fries and the horseradish sauce was the best idea we ever had.
RORY: It was satisfying in the moment though
LORELAI: I think you're going to blow that class away tomorrow.
RORY: You think?
LORELAI: I think. What do you say we call it a night and get some beauty sleep?
RORY: You go, I wanna review my notes one more time.
LORELAI: Oh that's ok, I'll stay up.
RORY: [ as she goes into the kitchen] Mom, go to sleep.
LORELAI: No, I'm not even tired. I was just thinking of you.
[Pan to later that night, Rory goes into the living room and finds Lorelai asleep on the couch. She covers her with a blanket and goes back to the kitchen. Later that night, Lorelai wakes up and goes into the kitchen to find Rory asleep at the table. She sits down and puts the blanket around Rory as well and falls asleep as well.]
[Pan to morning]
RORY: No! Oh no! [Rory runs into her room]
LORELAI: Oh jeez [lifting her head] Such a bad sleeping idea.
RORY: I'm late!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I'm late, I'm late. I woke up late!
LORELAI: Rory calm down.
RORY: I can't calm down! I missed my bus! Get up.
LORELAI: Sweetie, mommy can't get up right now. Mommy's been sleeping at a right angle all night.
RORY: I'm gonna miss the test! [comes out with her uniform over her t-shirt and jogging pants, putting on her shoes]
LORELAI: No you're not [Shoves a binder into Rory's school bag and give it to her] I'll get the keys. We'll go right now. Let's go! Let's go! [grabs her purse] Oh! I can't take you!
RORY: You have to!
LORELAI: I have a meeting at the inn at 8!
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Ok, wait. Ok. Think, listen. Here, you drive.
RORY: What?!
LORELAI: Yeah, you drive. I'll get a ride with Sookie. Take the phone, take the keys, go!
RORY: Are you sure?
LORELAI: Go, go, go, go!
RORY: I'm gone!
LORELAI: Good luck!
CUT TO RORY DRIVING
[She stops at a stop sign and calls Lane who's listening to music]
LANE: Hello?
RORY: Did I leave a set of my notes at your house yesterday?
LANE: Where are you?
RORY: I'm driving to school. I need to check something and I can't find some of my notes.
LANE: Ok, hold on let me check [comes out of her closet and looks around her room] I don't see anything.
RORY: What did I do with them?
LANE: Well, maybe it's downstairs in the store?
RORY: Maybe I just - [loud bang and car moved]
RORY: Oh my God!
LANE: Are you alright?
RORY: I just got hit by a deer.
LANE: You hit a deer?
RORY: No! I got hit by a deer!
LANE: How do you get hit by a deer?
RORY: I was at a stop sign and he just hit me! Oh my God! [Getting out to look for deer]
LANE: Was it a 4-way stop?
RORY: What does that matter?
LANE: I don't know. I don't know what to ask after you've been hit by a deer.
RORY: I don't see him.
LANE: Well put salt down. Deers love salt.
RORY: Where am I gonna get salt from?
LANE: Do you have a lunch?
RORY: Lane?
LANE: Sorry.
RORY: I don't see him any where. [as she tries to take off her jogging pants] What if he's hurt.
LANE: Rory your test
RORY: What time is it?
LANE: It's 7:40
RORY: No! [runs back to the car with one pant leg on, one off.]
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory's running down the hall pulling her socks up, taking out her ponytail ad tucking in her shirt]
[Enters classroom]
RORY: I'm sorry.
MAX: Everyone back to your tests. Miss Gilmore you're gonna have to wait in the library.
RORY: But what about the test?
MAX: I'm afraid you've missed the test.
RORY: No.
MAX: We start class promptly at 8:05
RORY: No.
MAX: That's when I need people to be in their seats.
RORY: Please.
MAX: I'm sorry but it's the rules.
RORY: But you don't understand! I was up all night studying and then I missed my bus so I had to drive--
MAX: Let's discuss this outside.
RORY: So I'm driving down this road and I stop and I get hit by a deer.
MAX: You hit a deer?
RORY: No I got hit by a deer. You don't believe me? I've got antler prints on the side of my mother's car.
MAX: Rory, come on.
RORY: No! You have to let me take this test. I'm ready for this test. I know everything there is to know about Shakespeare.
MAX: Ok, ok, you have to calm down now.
RORY: I know his birthday and his mothers name and that kind of -
PARIS: [whispers to Louise] Loser.
RORY: [turning around to her] And just what is wrong with you huh?! You already have everything! You already have the grades and the status. What the hell is wrong with you that you have this constant need to be the biggest jerk in the entire world?!
MAX: Ok, let's go.
RORY: Huh?! What's ?! What's up quippy?! Why so silent?
MAX: Outside - now
[walks by Tristan who's smiling]
RORY: And for the last time - the name's RORY!
[storms out.]
CUT TO INN
LORELAI: Make sure that carpet is replaced perfectly before they go
MICHEL: Ok.
LORELAI: I mean perfectly. Nailed down and everything.
MICHEL: Oh you mean that perfectly. Oh I thought you meant the other perfectly. You know the one that could be misinterpreted by the other Michel. You know the one who couldn't understand what you meant by perfectly. [Lorelai closes book and leaves]
DRELLA: Hey what do you think about Pat Benatar?
LORELAI: Great idea, can she play the harp?
SOOKIE: Whoo! Whoo-hoo! [Sookie is dancing around in the kitchen] I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! [Lorelai comes in] I found it, I found it!
LORELAI: You found what?
SOOKIE: His bill! I found his bill!
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
SOOKIE: It wasn't the risotto, it was the wine! He ordered the wrong wine!
LORELAI: Oh, well great!
SOOKIE: See in the review, he mentioned something about a summer tomato salad which I've only made once in the last 3 weeks because Jackson of course decides to get into a fist fight with his tomato grower - that's a different story.
LORELAI: Yes - save it for Christmas time.
SOOKIE: So Brian, the goatee waiter, only worked one shift last week because his girlfriend kicked him out and he had to move.
LORELAI: Celia kicked him out?
SOOKIE: Well, he didn't want kids.
LORELAI: But she knew that when they moved in.
SOOKIE: Women always think they can change men.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: So anyhow, I checked the dates, I narrowed the day down and I found a party that had ordered practically everything on the menu including -
LORELAI: The magic risotto!
SOOKIE: Yes, the risotto and a riesling. Ha! A riesling
LORELAI: Why not just drink battery acid.
SOOKIE: Exactly! Changes the entire flavor of the dish. And the fact that Brian even served it makes me think Celia is a little bit better off without him.
LORELAI: I'm so glad hon, oh! [they hug giggling]
[Jackson comes in]
JACKSON: Ok, here are the zucchinis
[Sookie takes one and looks at it]
SOOKIE: Too small, take'em away!
JACKSON: Oh, it's good to have her back huh
LORELAI: Yeah.
JACKSON: Yeah [pause] You're still gonna have to pay for the zucchini
[Lorelai smiles. Turns to go as Michel comes in]
MICHEL: There is a man with a funny accent on the phone asking for you.
LORELAI: Really? Did you guys exchange the secret handshake? [giggles with Jackson] Lorelai here [into the phone]
CUT TO CHILTON
LORELAI: Rory what happened?
RORY: I got hit by a deer.
LORELAI: You got what?
RORY: And then I was late and they wouldn't let me take the test.
LORELAI: [gasps] What?!
RORY: They wouldn't let me take the test so I -
LORELAI: Oh no you're kidding me?
RORY: Mom...
LORELAI: No, it's ok. Just sit right here, I'll handle this.
[Goes into Headmaster Charleston's office. Pan to inside Headmaster's office]
LORELAI: Excuse me. Hello.
CHARLESTON: Ms. Gilmore. Please come in.
LORELAI: Thank you.
CHARLESTON: Have a seat.
LORELAI: Um, I think there's been a terrible mistake. Rory told me that she wasn't allowed to take her test.
CHARLESTON: She was late.
LORELAI: Right, well, see there were circumstances beyond her control. Rory is never late. She's almost annoyingly on time. I think if you checked your records -
CHARLESTON: Past performance has nothing to do with today's situation.
LORELAI: Ok, but see, she was up all night studying, I was there, she has a witness.
CHARLESTON: She's not on trial here.
LORELAI: Well your honor [pause] just a little trial humor, that won't happen again. Um, see, she got up late, she broke her neck to get here. We don't like locally as you know.
CHARLESTON: The dog at my homework -
LORELAI: Excuse me?
CHARLESTON: My computer crashed and I lost my midterm.
LORELAI: I wasn't making excuses.
CHARLESTON: My grandmother and 1st cousin died. My sister took my report to school instead of hers, my religion prohibits studying after sundown. I went blind last night but I'm fine now.
LORELAI: That's not Rory.
CHARLESTON: [getting up] Ms. Gilmore, rules are rules. When you're late, you forfeit the right to take the test.
LORELAI: Where are you going? [to Max] Where is he going?
MAX: Lorelai please, believe me if I could do anything I would.
LORELAI: Yes, you could let her take the test.
MAX: I'm afraid I can't.
LORELAI: Well that's not fair.
CHARLESTON: Ms. Gilmore, we are not here to be fair, we are here to educate.
LORELAI: Yes and I'm asking you to please educate my kid.
CHARLESTON: We will, when she's on time. Have a nice day.
LORELAI: Are you holding that door open for a reason?
CHARLESTON: Our meeting is over.
LORELAI: Like hell it is.
MAX: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Do you have any idea what we have gone through this week? We have been up all night every night studying. We haven't slept. We haven't talked about anything else except this school and this test for seven days. We have stretched ourselves as thin as humanly possible without going completely postal. My God! We're only one person!
CHARLESTON: Why don't we narrow our field conversation down to Rory.
LORELAI: Ok, yeah, why don't we. You sit up here in your snotty little school that's in desperate need of some extra heating vents and you nurture horrible kids who treat each other like mortal enemies. You set impossible standards that make normal people feel less than everyone else. And you take a great kid like Rory and you tear her apart!
MAX: I don't think that's completely fair.
LORELAI: [to Max] And you! You say she's smart and she'll be fine and this rotting stodgy rathole could use somebody like her and then you completely shut her out of a test that she's crammed for, that she's ready for, that she completely deserves to take!
MAX: I didn't call this place a rathole'
LORELAI: Oh no that's true. I added that. Wouldn't want you to get in trouble with Il duce' here. I thought this place was going to be so great! And now I guess this goes on the Boy was I wrong' list, right above gauchos but just below the Flashdance' phase.
CHARLESTON: My goodness you do like to throw fits in your family.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
CHARLESTON: Your daughter threw a similar if not as manic fit of her own this morning.
LORELAI: Please. Rory doesn't throw fits. She's the most even tempered person I know.
CHARLESTON: Well then, she did a lovely impression of you.
LORELAI: Well I don't -
CHARLESTON: Ms. Gilmore, everything you said in your rant was absolutely true - without the colorful embellishments of course. We do set impossible standards, and such standards do foster highly competitive children. However that is life and that is Chilton.
LORELAI: Rules can change, you can change them.
CHARLESTON: I told your daughter when she came here that this place was not for everyone and might not be for her. I will now tell you the same thing. She doesn't have to be here. She doesn't have to go to Harvard, maybe she shouldn't if she can't handle the pressure, she should leave. Now you can take your daughter home now and decide what it is you intend to do. However, another outburst from either of you will not be on the options list. Thank you for coming in. That will be all.
CUT TO HALLWAY
LORELAI: You got hit by a deer?
[Pan to outside]
LORELAI: You did! You got hit by a deer.
RORY: It just came out of nowhere.
LORELAI: You couldn't just run into a wall like other kids.
RORY: Can we just go home please.
LORELAI: Yeah, sure. Jump in.
CUT TO SOOKIE OUTSIDE OF LUCENT MILLS HOUSE
LUCENT: May I help you?
SOOKIE: Yes, hello [with her back to him] My name is Sookie St. James, I'm
the chef at the Independence Inn.
LUCENT: I know who you are.
SOOKIE: You do? Well, I'm flattered, you write about a lot of chefs -
LUCENT: What are you doing here?
SOOKIE: Right. Well I know that this is a terrible intrusion but - are you cooking?
LUCENT: I'm making chicken.
SOOKIE: You used too much salt.
LUCENT: I did not
SOOKIE: Well it smells salty.
LUCENT: I'm closing the door.
SOOKIE: No wait. I found out your address from my network of culinary friends -
LUCENT: Look, this is really inappropriate. I gave you a good review, I suggest you go home.
SOOKIE: I don't care about the review. I just - I want you to try this disk, with this wine [handing them to him still with her back turned] I'll wait.
CUT TO LORELAI AND RORY DRIVING HOME
LORELAI: Quite a day huh?
RORY: I don't wanna talk - please.
LORELAI: You know, I just think that we should talk about it.
RORY: Stop the car.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Here - stop here. [jumps out]
LORELAI: You're just feeling like an impromptu nature walk?
RORY: I wanna see if it's ok.
LORELAI: If what's ok?
RORY: The deer.
LORELAI: Sweetie you're never gonna find the deer.
RORY: Well I'm gonna try.
LORELAI: Well I'm in heels!
RORY: Well stay in the car.
LORELAI: It's dangerous in the car with all the kamikaze deer running around [getting out of car]
RORY: I have to find it.
LORELAI: Alright, wait up! So what does the deer look like? Huh? Does it have any distinguishing marks - besides the word Jeep' imprinted on it's forehead.
RORY: It's just a deer.
LORELAI: I had a nice chat with Headmaster Charleston today. He said you went ballistic in class.
RORY: I was just tired.
LORELAI: You wouldn't have been so tired if you hadn't been k*ll yourself all week.
RORY: I was studying, I didn't have a choice.
LORELAI: Well maybe you shouldn't be studying that hard.
RORY: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: You're 16. You should get some sleep and eat a real meal and come up for air once in a while.
RORY: They kicked me out.
LORELAI: No, of course not. They love you. This is coming from me.
RORY: Are you saying I should quit?
LORELAI: I'm saying, if you wanted to go back to your other school with Lane, that would be fine with me.
RORY: You don't think I can do it.
LORELAI: You know that's not true. I think you can do anything. But you don't lose it in class. That's not part of the Rory personality description and if you're losing it in class because you're tired or stressed or working to hard, I'm worried about that. I have to be.
RORY: I lost it once.
LORELAI: Ok, fine. It's just I can't remember, you know, a time when we weren't talking about you going to Harvard. It was just a given, that what we were working for. Everything went in that direction.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: And I'm forgetting where all that started.
RORY: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: I'm talking about - did it start with me? Or did it start with you? Was it my dream that you go to Harvard.
RORY: Mom. [shaking her head]
LORELAI: Because I never got to do the big fancy college thing? Maybe all this time I'm thinking it's all for Rory, when really it wasn't.
RORY: I'm not doing this because of you.
LORELAI: Because if you are, you don't have to.
RORY: I know that.
LORELAI: I'll still love you. Even if you can't support me in my old age in the fabulous manner to which I plan on growing accustomed.
RORY: I'll remember that generous gesture.
LORELAI: Thank you. I just want you to be happy.
RORY: I am.
LORELAI: No, I want you to be dancing through the woods crazy' happy. And if Chilton and Harvard is not gonna do that for you, then forget about them.
RORY: I was just behind. I never caught up with all the reading. That's why I got a D'. I can catch up. I will catch up and when I do, everything will be fine.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: You know Harvard is my dream. I want it more than anything, I swear
LORELAI: Yeah but -
RORY: I appreciate all that you're saying. I do. But I'm not ready to give up on Chilton yet.
LORELAI: Fair enough.
RORY: I do however reserve the right to change my mind.
LORELAI: That's your prerogative as long as you remain a woman.
RORY: Thanks though.
LORELAI: For what?
RORY: For yelling at the Headmaster the way you did.
LORELAI: Oh, I didn't yell at him.
RORY: You called him il duce'
LORELAI: Which means kind sir' in Cantonese.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome. How much longer are we gonna look for this crazy deer?
RORY: Just a little further. I just hope he didn't hurt himself.
LORELAI: I just hope he has insurance.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
LORELAI: Go get that plaid skirt off and grab your books, we're going to Luke's.
RORY: Don't you have to get back to work?
LORELAI: Ah, they can last a little while longer without me. Plus Michel gets so cute when he feels like he's been overworked. His ears puff out, his nostrils flare, big fun. Go.
RORY: I'm gone.
[Phone rings, lets machine pick up]
LORELAI: [voice on answering machine] It's us, we're not here. We have a life, get over it.
[Lorelai closes books in the living room as she listens to the message, then sits on the couch]
MAX: Hi this is a message for Rory. It's Max Medina calling. I just wanted to say that I talked to Headmaster Charleston or il duce' as he's more affectionately know at the Gilmore household, and he's agreed to let you do some extra credit work to help make up for the missed test today. Now I'm not sure what the extra credit work is yet, but it probably will be time consuming and extremely painful. It will however get you back up to where you rightfully belong Rory, don't lose heart. Make this work. And if you're mother is listening, Lorelai it was a pleasure encountering you. I hope it happens again. Anyways, see you in class. Bye.

Rory's Birthday Parties
(Rory, Lorelai, and Emily are at Friday night dinner.)
EMILY: Tomorrow our lawyer, Joseph Stanford, is coming by.
LORELAI: Ugh. Crazy Sissy's dad.
EMILY: That's terrible. Sissy was a good friend of yours.
LORELAI: Mom, Sissy talked to her stuffed animals and they answered her.
RORY: Let's just start a new topic.
EMILY: Not possible!
LORELAI: She said a new topic, Mom.
EMILY: Everything's a joke. Everyone's a punch line.
LORELAI: OK, I'm sorry.
EMILY: My daughter -- Henny Youngman.
(Richard comes in late.)
RICHARD: Sorry for that. A little trouble with our China office. Well. What did I miss?
LORELAI: I was being impossible and then I turned into a Jewish comedian.
RICHARD: Ah. Well, continue.
EMILY: Thank you. Where was I?
RORY: Uh, Joseph Stanford is coming tomorrow.
EMILY: Yes. So, Rory, your grandfather and I thought it might be nice after dinner for you to go around the house and pick out what you'd like us to leave you in our wills.
RICHARD: Take a look at that desk in my office. It's a really fine Georgian piece.
LORELAI: Why don't I ever bring a tape recorder to these dinners?
RORY: Oh, well, anything you want to leave me is fine.
EMILY: Nonsense. You should have what you like. So look around and when you see something you like stick a post-it on it.
LORELAI: OK, you two have officially hit a new level of weird that even I marvel at.
EMILY: You can pick out things too, you know.
LORELAI: Oh, well now it's way less creepy.
EMILY: Did you hear that Richard? Apparently we're creepy.
RICHARD: Yes, well, live and learn.
(The maid comes in with a tray.)
RORY: Oh cool!
LORELAI: What's that?
EMILY: It's dessert.
LORELAI: It's pudding.
EMILY: Well if you knew what it was why did you ask?
LORELAI: You don't like pudding.
EMILY: Yes, but you like pudding.
LORELAI: Oh, I love pudding. I worship it. I have a bowl up on the mantel at home with the Virgin Mary, a glass of wine, and a dollar bill next to it.
RORY: I've never had pudding from a crystal bowl before.
EMILY You like the bowl?
RORY: Mmm.
EMILY: Put a post-it on it when you're done.
(Lorelai and Rory are putting post-its on on things in the living room.)
LORELAI: So what do we think of this?
RORY: Where would we put it?
LORELAI: I don't know. The Emily and Richard Gilmore Psycho Museum?
RORY: This is the strangest evening I've ever spent here.
EMILY: So, how's it going?
LORELAI: Great, just getting ready for the big day.
EMILY: Very nice.
LORELAI: So, um, it's getting late, Mom. Unless you've got some funeral plots for us to decorate we should really be going.
EMILY: Any special requests for dinner next week?
RORY: Oh, well --
LORELAI: Mom, I want to talk to you for a minute, and Rory, why don't you go say goodbye to Grandpa...
RORY: Very smooth.
(Rory leaves the room.)
EMILY: Should I sit down?
LORELAI: Yeah, but not there, OK? We got a post-it on that. We'd like to keep it nice.
EMILY: It must be very exhausting to be you.
LORELAI: Mom, Rory's birthday is next Friday.
EMILY: I know that.
LORELAI: So we were thinking that maybe we could push our dinner next week to Saturday.
EMILY: What are you going to do on Friday?
LORELAI: Oh I don't know.
EMILY: Well perfect. You'll come here and we'll have a little party.
LORELAI: I was just hoping we could do it another night.
EMILY: Well why come on another night when her birthday falls on the exact night that you do come here.
LORELAI: Saturday's a pretty good night, Mom.
EMILY: Not as good as Friday.
LORELAI: Pretty damn close.
EMILY: Not from where I'm standing.
LORELAI: Well, move then.
EMILY: I'm sorry. Friday nights are my nights. That's what we agreed on when you borrowed money for her school. The rules haven't changed.
LORELAI: Mom, I didn't intend for this loan to become a constant source of blackmail, OK? Now this is my kid's birthday and she will have her party at home on Friday and that's it? End of story.
(Cut to Rory and Lorelai sitting in the car.)
LORELAI: So, how would you like two parties this year?
RORY: You couldn't get her to cave.
LORELAI: No, but she did agree to make the string quartet to learn "Like A Virgin."
RORY: Well, you tried.
LORELAI: Sweetie, I promise, Saturday night we'll do it up right at home. A Stars Hollow extravaganza.
RORY: So, is this party Grandma's having going to be a big deal?
LORELAI: Not really. The government will close that day. Flags will fly at half-mast. Barbra Streisand will give her final concert...again.
RORY: Uh-huh.
LORELAI: Now, the Pope has previous plans, but he's trying to get out of them. However, Elvis and Jim Morrison are coming and they're bringing chips.
RORY: You ask a simple question...
(Cut to the inn. Lorelai is in the kitchen with Sookie.)
SOOKIE: Mini orange biscuits with honey-mustard ham and cheddar cheese.
LORELAI: Yum.
SOOKIE: Angel wings with dipping sauce.
LORELAI: Good, good.
SOOKIE: Oh, did you bring me the picture?
LORELAI: Oh, yes.
SOOKIE: Too bad you couldn't get your mom to relinquish Friday night.
LORELAI: No, she has her Vulcan death grip on that one.
SOOKIE: Not that surprising though.
LORELAI: Emily Gilmore -- you could set your watch by her. Oh, you know what she did do last night?
SOOKIE: Wore jeans?
LORELAI: Served pudding.
SOOKIE: I was close!
LORELAI: I mean, I'm sure it was some expensive form of pudding, but nonetheless, it was pudding!
SOOKIE: That is amazing.
LORELAI: Right. That would mean that she actually made a mental note that we liked pudding, which would mean that she actually listened to something other than the judgmental conga line going on in her head, and got over the fact that, to her, pudding is hospital food, and only acceptable when you've just had vital organ ripped out of your body.
SOOKIE: Wow, that's some journey she had to take there.
(Jackson rushes in.)
JACKSON: Open your mouth and close your eyes.
LORELAI: Who are you talking to?
JACKSON: Right, sorry. (goes to Sookie) Open your mouth and close your eyes.
SOOKIE: OK.
JACKSON: Now get ready for something truly amazing.
SOOKIE: Mmm!
JACKSON: Huh? Huh?
LORELAI: What is it?
SOOKIE: I don't know. It's like, um...
JACKSON: A what?
SOOKIE: It's like a berry, but way more exotic.
JACKSON: Yes! Good.
LORELAI: Jackson, have you been having reactions to your fertilizer fumes again?
JACKSON: For some time now I've been toying with cross-pollination. Finally I've got it. I figured out a way to cross a raspberry with a kumquat.
SOOKIE: Kumquat! That's what I taste! Are you serious? How did you do this?
LORELAI: You didn't build one of those machines like in "The Fly" did you? We're not going to find you wandering the streets wearing a raspberry head crying, "eat me!"
(Michel comes in and Jackson walks over to him.)
JACKSON You! You can make fun of me all you want to today, 'cause tday I am a god. Today, Mother Nature has bowed down to me.
MICHEL: How nice for her.
LORELAI: Michel, Jackson --
MICHEL: No need to fill me in. I'm quite happy being ignorant of whatever it is that is making him raise his arms over his head.
LORELAI: Do you need me?
MICHEL: The landscaper does.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, Rory's birthday party is Saturday night so start thinking up reasons why you can't come.
MICHEL: I'm going to be out of town.
LORELAI: Oh, you used that last year.
MICHEL: I'll work on it and get back to you
LORELAI: 7:00, presents mandatory.
MICHEL: Mm-hmm.
JACKSON: Rasquat?
(Cut to Lorelai's house. Rory is on the phone.)
LORELAI: Lucy, I'm home!
RORY: Kitchen.
LORELAI: 'And Justin is just so dreamy. He can't marry Britney, I'll just cry and cry and cry.'
RORY: (into the phone) OK, thanks. (hangs up phone) Pizza's on its way.
LORELAI: You're such a good provider. Hi.
RORY: I'm going to start my homework. Call me when the pizza guy gets here.
(Rory goes to her room. The phone rings.)
LORELAI: Hello?
EMILY: Lorelai, what is your work schedule?
LORELAI: Why?
EMILY: I want to go shopping.
LORELAI: With me?
EMILY: I think that goes without saying.
LORELAI: Only in your world, Mom.
EMILY: I want to get Rory a birthday present.
LORELAI: Well I'm sure whatever you get her, she'll love.
EMILY: Yes, but I want to get her something special, something she wants, something...that you would get her.
LORELAI: Oh, OK, fine. You can get her the bong then.
EMILY: This isn't funny. I hardly to see the girl and we only get to talk at dinner once a week and then it's all about school and Jane.
LORELAI: Lane, Mom.
EMILY: I thought you might let me into her secret club just this one time and help me buy her something for her birthday.
LORELAI: You're serious?
EMILY: According to you I'm always serious.
LORELAI: OK.
EMILY: OK?
LORELAI: OK.
EMILY: Well, good, I'll meet you at Damion's tomorrow at 3:00
LORELAI: OK.
EMILY: And dress appropriately --
LORELAI: Don't finish that sentence Mom.
EMILY: I'll see you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Thatagirl.
(Cut to Chilton. Rory is opening her locker.)
TRISTIN: Hey.
RORY: What, Tristin?
TRISTIN: I just wanted to say 'happy birthday.'
RORY: It's not my birthday.
TRISTIN: No, but it will be. (reading from a paper) 'On Friday at 4:03 in the morning, Lorelai Leigh --'
RORY: What is that?
(Rory takes the paper. It's an invitation to her birthday party, from Emily and Richard.)
RORY: Who else got these?
TRISTIN: I don't know. Everyone in our class, I think.
RORY I have to go.
TRISTIN: I'll see you Friday, birthday girl.
(Rory walks down the hall.)
LOUISE: That's her.
GIRL #2: My parents are making me go.
LOUISE: Another obligation party.
GIRL #2: My life stinks.
(Cut to a department store. Emily points to a hat.)
EMILY: Oh, isn't this lovely?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. As soon as we have her crowned Queen of England we'll give it to her.
EMILY: You are so combative today.
LORELAI: Hatwear does that to me. Oh, Mom, look. This is good.
EMILY: What is that?
LORELAI: It's a purse shaped like a guitar. This is great.
EMILY: Great for what?
LORELAI: For Rory.
EMILY: What will Rory do with that?
LORELAI: She'll put stuff in it. Carry it around.
EMILY: In public?
LORELAI: Yeah.
EMILY: What will people think?
LORELAI: That she's an ax m*rder, of course.
EMILY: What about pearls?
LORELAI: Pearls?
EMILY A double string of pearls with a cashmere sweater set.
LORELAI: Mom, she's a young girl. Think of something young.
EMILY: A Mont Blanc pen?
LORELAI: To put on her desk at the law firm?
EMILY: She needs to write.
LORELAI: Well not with a $200 pen, she doesn't. Oh, hey, look. These day planners are adorable. You could get her one of those funky erasers with a mermaid on it. She'll love that.
EMILY: Please be serious, we're shopping for Rory.
LORELAI: No, Mom, I'm shopping for Rory. You're shopping for your imaginary granddaughter, Barbara Hutton.
EMILY: I want to get her something nice.
LORELAI: I know you do, but you're not listening to me.
EMILY: You wanted me to get her a Filofax and a mermaid eraser.
LORELAI: It's one suggestion
EMILY: Oh, yes, and there was a T-shirt with a Farrah Fawcett face.
LORELAI: A hero to many who aspire to the perfect feather fluff.
EMILY: Oh I don't know how to do this. Let's just go.
LORELAI: Oh, no, no. Come on, Mom. You do know how to do this. Think pudding.
EMILY: Pudding?
LORELAI: Come on. You asked for my help. You're reaching out. A little -- not a lot -- don't get freaked. But, Mom -- pudding.
EMILY: Why do you keep saying pudding?
LORELAI: Listen, just look around and pick up something she might like.
(Emily picks up a bracelet.)
EMILY: Here.
LORELAI: Oh, now that's really good.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: Absolutely.
EMILY: Doesn't look like something you could buy at a car wash?
LORELAI: Totally. That's half the charm.
EMILY: Oh, no, it's only $12.
LORELAI: Six dollars more than a car wash.
EMILY: Twelve dollars is not a present.
LORELAI: Twelve dollars is a perfect present, Mom. She'll love that.
EMILY: Can I at least get her the pashmina also?
(Lorelai shakes her head no.)
EMILY: Fine, I'll get it.
LORELAI: Good choice.
EMILY Oh! It lights up.
(Cut to Luke's. Lorelai walks in with a garment bag. She looks around the diner and takes a seat at the counter.)
LUKE: She's not here yet.
LORELAI: All right. You'll have to entertain me until she arrives. OK, Burger Boy, dance.
LUKE: Will you marry me?
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Just looking for something to shut you up.
LORELAI: You better be nice to me or I'm not inviting you to Rory Gilmore's birthday celebration this Saturday night.
LUKE: You don't have to ask me, you know.
LORELAI: I know. But I would like you to come.
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: OK, I'll see.
LORELAI: 7:00. Don't be late.
(Rory walks in with her head down.)
LORELAI: Wow. Nice face you got on there.
RORY: Coffee.
LORELAI: Bad day?
RORY: I've now used the word 'sucks' so much that it's lost all meaning to me.
LORELAI: Well maybe this will cheer you up.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You'll see.
(Lorelai unzips the garment bag and pulls out a dress.)
RORY: What is that?
LORELAI: These are our party dresses.
RORY: So it's a Halloween party?
LORELAI: Listen, you. So I'm shopping today with your grandmother and it's a whole three hours of "Who are you buying that for, Mom? Have you met Rory?" and then finally I talked and she listened and she wound up getting you something I think you're really going to like.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Yes, really. And of course she insisted on buying us these dresses but I think I can do something with them to make them better.
RORY: Wow. I've never seen you so cheery after spending time with Grandma.
LORELAI: Well it's been a long time since we got together and didn't end up fighting. It was refreshing. It wasn't exactly fun but I didn't get that sh**ting pain in my eye like I usually do.
RORY: Wow. That's great.
LORELAI :Yeah.
(Luke brings coffee to their table.)
LUKE: So I hear you're having a party Saturday.
RORY: Yeah. Mom's famous for her blowouts.
LORELAI: The best one was her eighth birthday.
RORY: Oh, yeah, that was good.
LORELAI: The cops shut us down.
LUKE: The cops shut down an eight year old's birthday party?
RORY: And arrested the clown.
LUKE: I don't want to hear any more of this.
(Luke walks away.)
LORELAI: So, now tell me, why Miss Lemonhead today?
RORY: Nothing. I-I'm fine. I just got an A- on a French test that I should have gotten an A on.
LORELAI: Oh, honey, an A- is awesome.
RORY: Yeah, it's - it's fine.
LOREAI: Let me see. Maybe we should really embrace the whole tulle thing. Go totally modern Cinderella. What do you think? It's your birthday.
RORY: Yeah. Lucky me.
(Cut to Lorelai tiptoeing into Rory's room. It's the middle of the night.)
LORELAI: Happy birthday. little girl.
(Rory wakes up and moves over. Lorelai gets into bed with her.)
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: I can't believe how fast you're growing up.
RORY: Really? Feels slow.
LORELAI: Trust me, it's fast. What do you think of your life so far?
RORY: I think it's pretty good.
LORELAI: Any complaints?
RORY: I'd like that whole humidity thing to go away.
LORELAI: All right. I'll work on that.
RORY: So do I look older?
LORELA: Oh, yeah. You walk into Denny's before 5, you've got yourself a discount.
RORY: Good deal.
LORELAI: So you know what I think?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I think you're a great, cool kid, and the best friend a girl could have.
RORY: Right back at ya.
LORELAI: And it's so hard to believe that at exactly this time many moons ago, I was lying in exactly the same position --
RORY: Oh, boy. Here we go.
LORELAI: Only I had a huge, fat stomach and big fat ankles and I was swearing like a sailor --
RORY: On leave.
LORELAI: On leave -- right! And there I was --
RORY: In labor.
LORELAI: And while some have called it the most meaningful experience of your life, to me it was something more akin to doing the splits on a crate of dynamite.
RORY: I wonder if the Waltons ever did this.
LORELAI: And I was screaming and swearing and being surrounded as I was by a hundred prominent doctors, I just assumed there was an actual use for the cup of ice chips they gave me.
RORY: There wasn't.
LORELAI: But pelting the nurses sure was fun.
RORY: I love you, Mom.
LORELAI: Shh. I'm getting to the part where he sees your head. So there I was...
(Fade out.)
(Cut to Rory and Lane entering Luke's.)
LANE: You should not have to go to school today.
RORY: Have to. Latin test.
(Rory and Lane go to the counter.)
LANE: Jeez. Every day you have a test. When do you have time to learn anything to be tested on?
LUKE: Hey, wrong table.
RORY: Since when is there a right table?
LUKE: Since the coffee cake I baked for you and the stupid balloons I blew up are at that table, over there.
RORY: You blew up balloons for me?
LUKE: Yep.
RORY: Oh, Luke, you old softie.
LUKE: I count to three, it's gone.
RORY: Thank you.
(Lane and Rory move over to the decorated table.)
LANE: Are you OK?
RORY: Yeah, I'm just...I'm getting old, Lane.
LANE: You seem a little quiet this morning.
RORY: I'm just dreading this whole night. I mean, it's bad enough that I have to see these stupid kids from Chilton every day. But tonight? On my birthday? I've never even talked to most of them. I mean, I've only been going to this school for a couple months. God, they're gonna think I am the biggest freak and I need my grandma to get people to come to my party.
LANE: Well what did Lorelai say when you told her?
RORY: I didn't.
LANE: Why not?
RORY: Because of the pudding.
LANE: Oh, the pudding. Right, I forgot about the pudding.
RORY: My grandmother served us pudding the other night and then she went shopping with my mom and they didn't fight. I don't know, I mean, they never get along, and now suddenly they're getting along, and I knew that if I told Mom about the invites she'd wig out and call Grandma and that would be the end of the pudding.
LANE: You know you can buy pudding.
RORY: It's one night, right?
LANE: Right.
RORY: I can stand it for one night.
(Dean walks into the diner. He looks over at Rory as he shuts the door then goes to the counter.
DEAN: Coffee to go, please.
(Dean looks at Rory while he's waiting for his coffee.)
LUKE: Here you go.
DEAN: Thanks.
(Dean mouths "happy birthday" as he leaves. Rory smiles to herself.)
LANE: Why are you smiling?
RORY: I'm just thinking about pudding.
(Cut to Emily directing the caterers.)
EMILY: No, not there. In the living room. Why are you touching that? Why are you touching that? Well don't. I want those six inches apart! Get a ruler.
(Richard comes in trying to fix his tie.)
RICHARD: Emily!
EMILY: Let me do that.
RICHARD: I hope the Larsons are coming tonight.
EMILY: Richard, no business. This is your granddaughter's party.
RICHARD: Five minutes of shop talk isn't going to spoil the evening.
EMILY: Five minutes, please.
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: If I ever heard you keep your shop talk down to five minutes, I'd drop dead.
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: In fact I could drop dead and you wouldn't stop talking business. You'd just step right over my body to get to the speakerphone.
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: What?
RICHARD: You look very nice tonight.
EMILY: Thank you.
(Doorbell rings. Lorelai and Rory come in.)
LORELAI: Jeez, Mom. Leave some servants for the rest of the neighborhood.
EMILY: There she is -- the birthday girl.
RORY: Hi Grandma.
LORELAI: Wow, you really went all out, huh?
EMILY Well I wanted everything to be perfect. What do you think?
LORELAI: I think Edith Wharton would have been proud, and busy taking notes.
(Lorelai hands a garment bag to Rory.)
LORELAI: Here, babe, go change.
RORY: OK.
EMILY: Hurry!
(Lorelai takes off her coat.)
EMILY: What is that?
LORELAI: Oh, that's my dress.
EMILY: Where's the one I bought you?
LORELAI: This is it.
EMILY: I thought there was more of it.
LORELAI: Gee, Mom, the place looks great.
EMILY: Did you turn Rory's into a hat?
LORELAI: Nice candles. Six inches apart?
(Cut to the party.)
RICHARD: You're drinking white wine tonight? No Scotch?
LORELAI: (to a guest) Excuse me. I'm going to sit over there with my daughter.
GUEST: OK.
(Rory is sitting alone until Lorelai joins her and hands her a drink.)
LORELAI: Here.
RORY: What is it?
LORELAI: Shirley Temple.
RORY: What are you drinking?
LORELAI: A Shirley Temple Black.
(Lorelai lets Rory smell her drink.)
RORY: Wow.
LORELAI: I got your Good Ship Lollipop right here, mister. So do you want something to eat?
RORY: Everything smells funny.
EMILY: There you are. Come, there's some people I want you to meet.
(Rory goes with Emily.)
MITZI: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Yeah. Oh my God! Oh, Mitzie, wow, I haven't seen you since --
MITZI: Your seventh month.
LORELAI: I was going to say high school, but OK.
MITZI: Oh, no, did I say something rude?
LORELAI: No, no.
MITZI: No, I did. I said something rude. I've been trying to work on that.
LORELAI: Well, a noble goal.
MITZI: Ever since my divorce, I've been really trying to work on myself. You know, I just -- I want to grow.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
MITZI: Lorelai Gilmore, the scandal girl! Now, tell me, what ever happened with Christopher?
LORELAI: Christopher is in California.
MITZI: Oh, do you hear from him?
LORELAI: Uh --
MITZI: I'm sorry, is this painful for you to talk about?
LORELAI: Uh, well --
MITZI: When did he last call you?
LORELAI: God, you're making progress with that rude thing, huh, Mitz?
MITZI: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: It's OK. He calls like once a week and we see him at Christmas, sometimes Easter. It's all very civil.
MITZI: So are you married now?
LORELAI: No, it's just me and Rory.
MITZI: Your cat?
LORELAI: My kid! She's right over there.
MITZI: Oh. (turns to look) Wow! You can really see Christopher in her, can't you?
LORELAI: Yes, you can.
MITZI: Does that k*ll you?
LORELAI: You know, what? I see...someone...else...and it's been great.
(Cut to Richard standing with some business associates.)
RICHARD: Oh, no, those aren't the terms we agreed on.
LARS: They most certainly are.
RICHARD: Lars, you were at the same meeting I was. We specifically spelled out a five year extention, not a three year one.
LARS: I heard three.
RORY: Hi Grandpa!
RICHARD: Rory. Gentlemen, this is my granddaughter, Rory.
LARS: Happy birthday, Rory.
(The men all hand envelopes to Rory.)
LARS: I think we should Dennis on the phone right now.
RICHARD: Fine, I've got a phone in my office.
(The men leave.)
EMILY: Rory, there's a whole group of your school friends in the library. Let's go say hello to them.
(Emily and Rory go into the library where kids from Chilton are standing around looking bored.)
RORY: I have to go to the bathroom.
EMILY: Just say hello first. Come on, I'll hold those for you.
KID #3: Who's that?
KID #4: I think it's her party.
KID #3: Oh.
(Rory looks around the room and turns to leave.)
RORY: Paris?
PARIS: My parents made me come.
RORY: Oh God!
PARIS: Otherwise I wouldn't be here. You believe me, don't you?
(Rory walks away from Paris and sees Tristin coming in the front door.
TRISTIN: Oh, coming to greet me?
RORY: Hello, Tristin.
TRISTIN: So where's my birthday kiss?
RORY: It's my birthday.
TRISTIN: So I'll give you a birthday kiss.
RORY: What is wrong with you?
TRISTIN: Ok, I gotta tell you something. I'm madly in love with you.
RORY: Well, good luck with that.
TRISTIN: I can't eat, I can't sleep...I wake up in the middle of the night calling your name. Rory, Rory!
RORY: Would you shut up please?
RICHARD: Rory, who's your friend?
RORY: I don't know but this is Tristin.
RICHARD: Excuse me?
TRISTIN: Tristin Dugray, sir.
RICHARD: Dugray? Are you any relation to Janlen Dugray?
RICHARD: That's my grandfather, sir.
RICHARD: Well I've done business with Janlen for years. He's a fine man.
TRISTIN: That he is.
RICHARD: Rory, you've got very good taste in friends. I approve.
LARS: Richard, I've got Dennis on the phone and he heard the same thing I heard.
RICHARD: Well, one wrong man can always find a friend.
(Richard and Lars leave.)
TRISTIN: He likes me.
RORY: He's drunk.
TRISTIN Let's take a walk.
RORY: This is stuipd. you don't even like me! You just have this weird need to prove that I'll go out with you. That's not liking someone.
TRISTIN: Why are you fighting this? You're gonna give in eventually.
RORY: I'm going to go find my mother.
TRISTIN: Wow, meeting your mom. It's a bit sudden, but OK.
(Paris leans against a door and watches Tristin.)
(Rory walks up to Lorelai and Emily.)
EMILY: Oh there you are! I think it's time that you said a few words to your guests.
RORY: What?
EMILY: Just a little speech to say thank you and tell everyone how it feels to be one year older.
LORELAI: Mom, I don't she wants--
EMILY: She's the hostess, Lorelai. This is her responsibility.
RORY: I am not the hostess! You are!
LORELAI: Hey, honey, hold on...
RORY: This is your party and these are your guests and I don't have anything to say to them, so you give the speech.
EMILY: Rory!
RORY: Excuse me.
LORELAI: What was that all about?
EMILY: Lorelai, your daughter has no manners whatsoever. You should be ashamed of yourself.
(Emily walks away.)
LORELAI: OK, how did this become my fault?



(Cut to Rory lying on the bed in Lorelai's old room.)
LORELAI: Hey. Can I come in?
RORY: It's your room.
LORELAI: How are you doing?
RORY: I'm sorry I snapped at Grandma.
LORELAI: Yeah, hugh? That was a pretty 'Freaky Friday' moment we had back there.
RORY: She just went ahead and invited all these kids from Chilton.
LORELAI: You're kidding. I thought she checked on that with you.
RORY: She didn't ask me or tell me.
LORELAI: Oh, man, I'm so sorry.
RORY: It just -- I don't know but it really made me mad.
LORELAI: Oh, honey, why didn't you tell me?
RORY: Because you were happy. I mean, it's not very often that there's peace between the two of you. I didn't want to screw everything up.
LORELAI: Rory, I appreciate you wanting you wanting Mom and I to get along but you shouldn't keep stuff like that from me.
RORY: I feel terrible. I mean, I've never yelled at her before.
LORELAI: Listen, you'll apologize, all will be forgotten. You'll see. Man. It's like time has stood still in this room.
RORY: It must be weird for you to be in this room now.
LORELAI: Yeah, it was weird for me to be in this room then. (points to a dollhouse) You know, they gave this to me with the glass on.
RORY: I now officially know what it feels like to have grown up here.
LORELAI: It's not official until you're huddled in the corner eating your hair.
RORY: Do you remember your last birthday here?
LORELAI: Yeah. We had just had a fight and I was lying on the bed just like you are now.
RORY: What did you fight about?
LORELAI: Well, I was pregnant.
RORY: Oh, that.
LORELAI: And I said something at the table about the pate smelling like Clorox and one thing led to another and I wound up here. I hadn't told anybody yet about me. And you.
RORY: That must have been really hard on you.
LORELAI: Yeah. I remember when I finally told them, it was the only time they ever looked small to me.
RORY: I guess I'd better go find Grandma.
LORELAI: Mmm. Give her a minute.
EMILY: There you are!
LORELAI: She'll find us.
EMILY You are both being very rude. This isn't my birthday party, you know.
LORELAI: Sorry, Mom.
EMILY: Honestly, the way the two of you act.
RORY: Grandma, I just want to --
EMILY: We'll talk about this later. Now go.
(Cut to Emily saying goodnight to the last of the guests.)
EMILY: Thank you, good to see you. Lovely as always, Leeza. My best to Darren.
LORELAI: Hey, Mom. Great party. One of your best. I even liked those brown mushroom things.
RORY: Grandma, can I talk to you for a sec?
EMILY: Richard, the girls are leaving.
RICHARD: Well, Rory, I hope you had a good time.
RORY: Yes, I did.
RICHARD: Now, I know that your grandmother has already bought you a gift and signed my name to it. That was part of our agreement when we got married. However, I feel this occasion calls for something a little extra. (hands her a check) Put that towards your trip to Fez.
RORY: Oh, Grandpa!
RICHARD: You're a good girl, Rory. Happy birthday.
RORY: I don't deserve this.
LORELAI: Fine, hand it over.
EMILY: You girls should get going. You've got quite a drive ahead of you.
RORY: Grandma, we're having a party tomorrow at our house and -- I mean, it won't be anything like this but it will be fun and maybe you and Grandpa can come?
EMILY: That's very sweet, dear, but I'm afraid we already have plans.
RORY: Oh, Ok.
EMILY: Have a safe trip. Lock the door behind you, OK?
(Emily walks away.)
LORELAI: Hey, um, why don't you go help that guy out there put all the presents in the car.
RORY: OK.
EMILY: (to catering staff) All this can go in the dishwasher.
LORELAI: Mom, come to the party tomorrow.
EMILY: I can't. I'm busy. (to catering staff) Throw those out, we won't need them.
LORELAI: Mom, your granddaughter invited you to her birthday party. Please, come.
EMILY: I've already been to a party for my granddaughter and she humilitated me in front of all of my friends. I have no desire to relive that experience. (to catering staff) The cheeses must be put in individual bags, please.
LORELAI: Oh come on, give her a break. You invited all these Chilton kids without even asking her.
EMILY: They're her schoolmates. I assumed they were her friends
LORELAI: You know what they say when people assume things.
EMILY No, what do they say?
LORELAI: That -- you shouldn't.
EMILY: Very clever.
LORELAI: Mom, she didn't want them here. She doesn't like them.
EMILY: Well I had to invite them. That's just good manners, something that your daughter is sorely lacking.
LORELAI: God, you know, you're doing the same thing to her that you always did to me. You're trying to control her and when that doesn't work you just shut her out.
EMILY: I'm too tired for your accusations right now. Can we do this tomorrow?
LORELAI: I'm just --
EMILY: Here, I'll find you a pen so you can write down all your insults so that you won't forget them.
LORELAI: Mom, this is not funny. I have a crushed kid out in the car.
EMILY: What do you want me to say? Everything's fine, it's forgotten. There, I'll see you next week.
LORELAI: So I guess the whole pudding thing was just a fluke, huh? Trying to get to know us, easing up on the rules, smuding that bottom line of yours. It was just some weird phase. What, you were on cold medicine last week or something?
EMILY: Oh, so I'm a villan now, is that it? I spent a fortune on this party. I spent days planning it, making sure that every little detail was perfect -- the food, the linen, the music. And I did all this for Rory.
LORELAI: Well that's not what she needs. She needs you to accept her apology and come to her party. That's what she needs. You don't care what she needs.
EMILY: How dare you!
LORELAI: You don't even know what she needs because you don't know her. You've never tried to know her just like you never knew me.
EMILY: Oh I know you.
LORELAI: Oh, please. You don't know anything about me.
EMILY: Oh, you'd like to think that, wouldn't you? That you're just some huge mystery to me. 'Why does Lorelai do that?' 'I don't know, she's a mystery to me.' Well you're not so mysterious, Lorelai.
LORELAI: No! No! What am I then?
EMILY: Well right now you're very loud and disruptive to the entire cleaning process. (to catering staff) For God's sake! What do I have to do to get you to put the damn cheese in individual bags?
LORELAI: Fine, I give up
EMILY: Oh, you give up? If I had a dollar for every time you gave up --
LORELAI: Then you could pay for this party, couldn't you?
(Cut to Lorelai's house. Sookie is unpacking groceries when Lorelai walks into the kitchen.)
SOOKIE: I made coffee.
LORELAI: Mmm.
SOOKIE: Hangover?
LORELAI: Emily.
SOOKIE: Oh. Got it. Moving on...
RORY: Good morning.
SOOKIE: Morning, Popcorn. You want some pancakes?
RORY: No, I've gotta get going.
LORELAI: Where?
RORY: The college fair is this morning.
LORELAI: So you're going to get yet another Harvard brochure?
RORY: I just want to see if they've changed the pictures.
LORELAI: Weirdo.
RORY: I'll be back in plenty of time to help you decorate.
LORELAI: No, this is your party. You do not work. You lounge and mock those who are. Have I taught you nothing?
RORY: Sorry. I'll try to be better. Bye.
SOOKIE: OK, bye-bye.
(Cut to the college fair. Rory stops at the Harvard table.)
RORY: New brochure?
HARVARD REP: Yes.
PARIS: What are you doing here?
RORY: There's a college fair going on.
PARIS: No, I mean, what are you doing here?
RORY: I'm getting a new brochure.
PARIS: Why?
RORY: Because they're not selling pizza. (pause) Oh no.
PARIS: You can't.
RORY: You're applying to Harvard?
PARIS: Yes.
RORY: No!
PARIS: Ten generations of Gellers have gone to Harvard. I have to go to Harvard.
RORY: I can't believe this.
PARIS: You can go somewhere else. Go to Brandeis. Brandeis is nice.
RORY: I've only ever wanted to go to Harvard. That's it. Nowhere else. (pause) It's a big school.
PARIS: I guess.
RORY: We'll probably never see each other.
PARIS: You think?
RORY: And if we do, we duck.
PARIS: OK. So...
(Paris starts to walk away then stops.)
PARIS: Hey...Are you dating Tristin?
RORY: What? No. No way.
PARIS: Do you like him?
RORY: Not even a little.
PARIS: Really?
RORY: Really.
PARIS: OK.
(Paris turns away thens stops again.)
PARIS: Hey...Nice party.
RORY: Thanks.
(Cut to Rory's second party.The house is filled with loud music and the people of Stars Hollow.)
MISS PATTY: Happy birthday Rory!
LORELAI: Open it, open it, open it!
(Rory is opening her presents. She gets an iBook from Lorelai.)
RORY: No!
LORELAI: You like it? You can take it back.
RORY: No! I love it! It's perfect.
LORELAI: It's blue and it has a handle.
RORY: It's way too expensive.
LORELAI: I know, that's what I told the guy at the store.
(Sookie brings in a cake with Rory's face on it.)
SOOKIE: OK! On three 'cause I'm gonna drop it. OK, One, two --
(Everyone sings "Happy Birthday.")
LORELAI: Make a wish.
(Rory blows out the candles.)
LORELAI: All right, everybody, I need your attention, your attention please. This is a very serious moment. Two priests, a rabbi and a duck --
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: All right, I'm kidding. Um, I would like to propose a toast to the one thing in my life that is always good, always sweet, and without whom I would have no reason to get up in the morning. My pal Rory. Cheers.
BABETTE: Happy birthday.
LORELAI: And in honor of this very special girl I now invite you all to help me eat her face.
(Doorbell rings. Sookie hands Rory a knife.)
SOOKIE: And you may have the first cut.
RORY: There's something very strange about hacking into my own head.
(Doorbell rings again.)
LORELAI: Jeez, who the hell's ringing the bell? It's a party! Get your ass in here!
(Emily and Richard walk in the door.)
LORELAI: Or asses I guess.
RORY: Grandma! Grandpa! I can't believe you're here. I'm so glad you came. Hey, no tie?
RICHARD: I thought I'd mix it up a little.
RORY: Grandma, look.
(Rory shows Emily that she's wearing the bracelet.)
EMILY: Why, it looks lovely.
RORY: I want you to meet everyone. Everyone, these are my grandparents.
EVERYONE: Hi.
RICHARD: Hello.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Emily, Dad.
RICHARD: Lorelai, you look well.
MISS PATTY: I'm Patricia LaCosta. We just love your daughter and granddaughter.
EMILY: Thank you.
MISS PATTY: My God, you're a tall speciman of a man. Must be all that good air in Hartford.
LORELAI: Mom, Dad, can I get you a drink?
EMILY: No, thank you.
LORELAI: Oh, no, Mom, you're going to need one and I have wine glasses that say "Holiday Inn" on them.
EMILY: Stoli on the rocks with a twist.
LORELAI: Right.
(Lorelai goes into the kitchen.)
LORELAI: Um, OK, uh, my parents are here.
SOOKIE: No!
LORELAI: Yeah. I've cursed in front of them twice and Miss Patty already tried to hit on my dad, and I'm sure my mom is going to call Child Protective Services
SOOKIE: God, when was the last time they were here?
LORELAI: Never.
SOOKIE: Not once?
LORELAI: Not since we moved here. I mean, they'd come down and visit is occasionally when Rory was a baby and we lived at the inn, but they have never been here.
SOOKIE: Wow. That's big stuff. Is Rory thrilled?
LORELAI: Through the roof.
SOOKIE: Oh, that's great.
EMILY: Lorelai, I just tried some of thse hors d'ouevres. They're unbelievable. Who is your caterer?
LORELAI: Sookie.
EMILY: What's a Sookie?
LORELAI: That's a Sookie.
SOOKIE: Hi. Sookie St. James.
LORELAI: Sookie's the chef at the inn, Mom.
EMILY: My dear, you are very talented.
SOOKIE: Thank you.
EMILY: Well, you must cater my next party. When my friends get wind of you you're going to have so much business you won't know what to do with yourself. But remember -- I discovered you.
LORELAI: Mom, Sookie has a job. She's the chef at the inn. The inn where we work -- my inn. Six days a week, Mom. (to Sookie) Just give her your number or we'll never get out of here.
SOOKIE: OK.
(Cut to Richard looking up the fireplace.)
LORELAI: So, how does it look?
RICHARD: Well, it doesn't look structurally sound.
LORELAI: Drink up, Dad.
(Richard walks away and Sookie runs into the living room.)
SOOKIE: OK, don't panic.
LORELAI: Good opening line. What's wrong?
SOOKIE: We're out of ice.
LORELAI: How could we be out of ice? We had a ton of ice. It was like a penguin habitat in there.
SOOKIE: I don't know how it happened, I just know it happened and somehow we have to deal with it.
LORELAI: I will go and get some then.
(Lorelai starts out the door. Luke comes in carrying ice.)
LORELAI: Oh! Oh my God! You're a vision! Sookie, we have ice!
SOOKIE: Hallelujah.
LORELAI: How did you know?
LUKE: Well, a good rule of thumb is you can never have too much ice.
LORELAI: Oh, you're the best.
(Lorelai hugs Luke just as Emily comes out of the kitchen.)
LORELAI: That's -- Oh, hi, Mom. This is my friend Luke
LUKE: How are you doing?
EMILY: Fine, thank you.
LUKE: Well I'd better get these in the freezer before they melts.
LORELAI: Well, not very likely in here.
(Rory finds Richard on the porch.)
RORY: Grandpa?
RICHARD: Rory, what a lovely party.
RORY: I brought you something to read.
RICHARD: Oh.
RORY: It's not the Wall Street Journal, but there's a quiz in there that determines whether you're a summer or a fall.
RICHARD: Well I appreciate this, thank you.
(Back inside, everyone is in the living room.)
BABETTE: Oh, Morey, you remember the time that Rory decided that our old tree stump was a fairy ring?
MOREY: I sure do.
BABETTE: How old was she then, sugar?
LORELAI: I think she was about 10.
RORY: Hey, all I know is that it matched the description .
BABETTE: Oh, God, she was cute. She used to sit out there with a peanut butter sandwich just waiting for the fairy to get hungry.
RORY: OK, new story.
MISS PATTY: I'm still crushed beyond belief that she quit her ballet lessons.
LORELAI: Oh, not me. Miss Perfect Work Ethic would prance around this room 24 hours a day.
RORY: And I still stunk.
LANE: I can vouch for that.
MISS PATTY: That's not true!
MOREY: She was pretty bad.
MISS PATTY: No, don't you listen to them. You had a true gift.
(Everyone laughs.
MISS PATTY: What? She did. She was talented.
(Everyone laughs. Emily gets up and goes up to Lorelai's bedroom. Lorelai follows her. Emily picks up a quilt.)
LORELAI: I made that.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: From Rory's old baby clothes
EMILY: How nice. Hope you washed them first.
LORELAI: Oh, rats. I knew I forgot something.
EMILY: That's quite an assortment of characters you've assembled down there.
LORELAI: They're great people.
EMILY: This Patricia --
LORELAI: Miss Patty.
EMILY: She teaches dance?
LORELAI: Among other things.
EMILY: And this man with the ice.
LORELAI: Luke.
EMILY: How long have you been seeing him?
LORELAI: Luke? I'm not seeing Luke. He's just a friend.
EMILY: Mm-hmm.
LORELAI: Mom, I swear. Luke keeps me in coffee, nothing else.
EMILY: He seems to like you.
LORELAI: And you're judging this by what?
EMILY: By they way he looked at you.
LORELAI: Which is how?
EMILY: Like you were about to give him a lap dance.
LORELAI: Mom, he did not look at me like that.
EMILY: You're pleased.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: You smiled. You're pleased that the ice man looked at you like a Porterhouse steak.
LORELAI: I'm smiling because you're crazy and that's what you do to crazy people to keep them calm.
(Emily picks up a picture of Lorelai on crutches.)
EMILY: What's this?
LORELAI: Well, that's me, Mom.
EMILY: I know that's you. You're wearing a cast.
LORELAI: Yeah, that's when I broke my leg.
EMILY: You broke your leg?
LORELAI: Yeah, three years ago during a yoga class. The headstand portion took a very ugly turn. The good thing was I brought the smug, blonde, pretzel chick down with me. I've since learned that I'm a bit too comptetitive for yoga.
EMILY: I never knew that you broke your leg.
LORELAI: It was no big deal, Mom. If I'd been really sick you would have known.
EMILY: Yeah, well...You know, could get a maid in here once a week to at least tidy the place up.
LORELAI: I like it cluttered.
EMILY: You can't even find the bed.
LORELAI: Yes I can. It's the thing that I crash into on the way to the closet.
EMILY: I should go check on your father.
LORELAI: It was nice that you came tonight, Mom. It meant a lot. To Rory. Really.
EMILY: Well, she is my granddaughter, after all. I should be here.
LORELAI: I totally agree.
(Emily starts to fold up the quilt.)
LORELAI: Leave it.
(Emily walks onto the porch. Richard is reading Rory's magazine.)
EMILY: It's time to go now.
RICHARD: In a minute, please.
EMILY: Rory, we're going to get going now.
RORY: Thank you for coming.
EMILY: Thanks for asking me.
RICHARD: Ah, lovely party. I enjoyed the reading material immensely.
RORY: So what's the verdict?
RICHARD: I am an autumn.
RORY: Interesting.
RICHARD: Isn't it?
LORELAI: Hey, so you guys leaving? The mud wrestling starts in ten minutes.
EMILY: Good night, Lorelai. We had a lovely time.
LORELAI: And with a straight face you said that.
RICHARD: I'd have that chimney inspected if I were you.
LORELAI: I'll get right on that, Dad.
(Richard hands Rory a check.)
RICHARD: For Fez.
RORY: But Grandpa, you already took care of that.
RICHARD: Fez is a very large city.
(Rory and Lorelai watch Emily and Richard walk to their car.)
RORY: So...
LORELAI: Food fight?
RORY: Absolutely.
(They run back inside.)
(Emily is silent in the car.)
RICHARD: Emily?
EMILY: She's right. I don't know my daughter at all. We should go. Traffic.
(Cut to the kitchen. Lorelai and Sookie are cleaning up.)
LORELAI: Next year, we are going to a McDonald's with one of those slides and that's it.
SOOKIE: The party was a hit.
LORELAI: And we'll be eating onion dip for breakfast for a week.
SOOKIE: You know, you mix that dip with some groud turkey and some garlic and it's really not too bad.
LORELAI: Hey, I'm not looking for a recipe.
SOOKIE: Ooh, reflex, sorry. OK, I'm gonna go check the living room.
LORELAI: OK.
(Standing at the sink, Lorelai looks up and sees Rory in the yard with Dean.)
RORY: You didn't have to get me anything.
DEAN: Sorry, that's the rules. You get older, you get a gift.
RORY: I'm sorry about this sort of sneaky thing. I just haven't told my mother yet about you. I mean, not that there's to tell. I just --
DEAN: That's OK. This is better.
(Rory unwraps the gift.)
RORY: Oh my God. It's beautiful.
DEAN: Well, I bought the medallion and I just cut some leather straps and drilled a hole, and well, you like it?
RORY: I -- it's amazing.
DEAN: Good.
RORY: Thank you.
DEAN: Here.
(Dean ties it around Rory's wrist. They smile at each other. Lorelai is still watching from the window.)

Cinnamon's Wake
(Lorelai, Rory, and Emily Gilmore are sitting around the dinner table.)
LORELAI: So where'd you say Dad was?
EMILY: Away on business.
LORELAI: Location's top secret?
EMILY: Oh, Germany.
LORELAI: Germany. Is Dad's firm insuring n*zi now?
EMILY: Your father doesn't know any n*zi.
LORELAI: I know, Mom. I was just --
EMILY: What?
RORY: Joking. She was joking.
EMILY: Oh. Hard to tell.
LORELAI: Yeah, well.
EMILY: Oh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Claudia died.
LORELAI: Who?
EMILY: Claudia. Your cousin Claudia. (Lorelai stares.) Claudia!
LORELAI: I'm hearing the name, Mom. I have no idea who that is.
EMILY: Claudia's your cousin, for all intents and purposes.
LORELAI: Oh, now we're getting to it.
EMILY: She was your father's grandmother's sister's girl. So to you, that would make her --
LORELAI: Nothing?
EMILY: Regardless the funeral's on Thursday. I thought we'd all go together.
LORELAI: Ooh, whoa. Two problems. Impossible to get away from the inn Thursday. Two, I've never met this woman.
EMILY: You most certainly have.
LORELAI: When?
EMILY: Several times.
LORELAI: I'll take one.
EMILY: We went to her house in Groton to see the first moon landing. She'd just gotten a new Philco.
LORELAI: I have no memory of this whatsoever.
EMILY: Rory, correct me if I'm wrong, but men have walked on the moon regardless of whether your mother remembers it or not.
RORY: That's the rumor.
LORELAI: I know men have walked on the moon. I just don't know Claudia.
EMILY: So you're not going?
LORELAI: Not this time.
EMILY: I don't think Claudia's planning to die a second time.
LORELAI: Mom, I couldn't go if I wanted to.
EMILY: Fine. (pauses) Oh wait -- Rudolph Gottfried.
LORELAI: Another cousin?
EMILY: No, a n*zi that we knew. I'd forgotten. We stayed with him once in Munich. Nice old man. Interesting stories.
LORELAI: Mom you socialized with a n*zi? That's despicable! That's heinous!
EMILY: No, dear, that was a joke.
(Rory laughs.)
(Cut to Lorelai's kitchen. It is morning and Lorelai is seated at the table drinking coffee. Rory walks into the kitchen and closes her bedroom door on loud music.)
LORELAI: Hey. I have an idea for a new reality show. How about everyone just looks out their freakin' kitchen window for a change?
RORY: Ooh. She's cranky this morning.
LORELAI: Let's just say the world has a formidable opponent.
RORY: Wait -- shouldn't you be baking?
LORELAI: I don't know. Shouldn't you be knitting?
RORY: Mom! The Chilton bake sale is today!
LORELAI: I know. I got it covered.
RORY: They expect the things to be homemade.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: By someone other than Dolly Madison.
LORELAI: I said I have it covered.
RORY: All of the parents pitch in so this is really really important. You know that, right?
LORELAI: No, I didn't know that. In that case I don't have it covered. I have it covered! Get your stuff and hit the stereo -- we're late.
RORY: (softly) It's not me.
(Rory opens her door and we see Lane dancing in the room.)
LORELAI: (to Lane) Where does your mother think you are?
(Lane turns off the music.)
LANE: Oh, on a park bench contemplating the reunification of the two Koreas.
LORELAI: Not here, skanking to Rancid?
LANE: Wouldn't be included.
LORELAI: School!
(Cut to exterior of the house. Lane, Lorelai, and Rory walk down the front steps and start to cross the yard. Lane waves as she runs off.)
LANE: Bye.
RORY: Bye.
(Babette and Morey walk by. Morey is pulling a wagon with Cinnamon -- their cat --inside. The wagon has a covering like a baby carriage.)
RORY: Wow, Cinnamon, riding in style.
BABETTE: Yeah, Morey made it. Cinnamon's not walking good these days but she still likes her passeggiatas. That's Italian for 'a nice walk.'
MOREY: (with an accent) Passeggiata.
BABETTE: Oh God, he makes it sound so sexy.
MOREY: Come on.
LORELAI: (points to the covered area) What's that?
BABETTE: Oh it's Cinnamon's private area. Sometimes she likes to be alone. She's just like Morey in that sense. (to Morey) Hey, say passaggiata again.
MOREY: I can't do it on command, Babs.
BABETTE: Oh, he's blushin'. God, I love a man that blushes!
(BABETTE and MOREY walk away, pulling the wagon.)
RORY: Okay, our town is just weird.
LORELAI: Thank God.
RORY: Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
RORY: I'll see you later at school.
LORELAI: For what?
RORY: Mom, the bake sale!
LORELAI: Ha! I got the vein in the forehead. Whoo!
RORY: Sadist.
(Cut to a busy street. People are walking by on the sidewalk. Rory is sitting on a bench. A bus pulls around the corner and stops in front of her. Dean is walking down the street and sees Rory get on the bus. He gets on and sits behind her. Rory opens her book and beings to read. She doesn't notice him.)
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Aah! Morning.
DEAN: Good book?
RORY: I don't know yet.
DEAN: I saw you standing in line so I thought I'd say hello. (pause) Hello?
RORY: Hello.
DEAN: Oh, hey, uh, thanks for helping me get the job at the store. I mean it's not a career or anything but it's got me solvent.
RORY: Solvent's good.
DEAN: Yeah, uh, are you always this serious?
RORY: No.
DEAN: So, uh, how long does it take you to get to school?
RORY: Um...forty minutes if the bus driver's focused but longer if he's trying to win something on the radio. Hey, this bus is going to Hartford!
DEAN: Yeah, I know.
RORY: But you go to school here. You have to get off the bus! (calls to driver) Hey, he has to get off the bus!
DEAN: Wait. You're forgetting something.
(Bus stops.)
DEAN: Buses make stops. Good-bye Lorelai Gilmore.
(Dean gets off the bus.)
(Cut to the inn where Michel is on the phone.)
MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking. Yes, you are confirmed. Mm-hmm. Goodbye.
(Michel hangs up the phone as a group of businessmen approach the counter.)
MAN: Bonjour Monsieur. Vous êtes francais? Vous parlez francais?
MICHEL: No, sorry.
MAN: Parlez vous fracais?
MICHEL: Sir, I'm just a simple country boy from Texas. I do not understand this francais business you're babbling about.
LORELAI: Pardon
(Lorelai pulls Michel aside.)
LORELAI: He knows you're not from Texas.
MICHEL: Smile when you say that.
LORELAI: Michel, I told you there was going to be a French group here for a couple of days and it is your job to keep them happy.
MICHEL: Lorelai, I don't know how many French people you've met over the years, but most of them are insufferable.
LORELAI: Really?
MICHEL: Mm-hm. That is why I left France.
LORELAI: Huh. I thought it had something to do with the torches and the villagers. Michel, talk to them.
MICHEL: Never. (pause) You are giving me that look aren't you? Your patented, "Do it or something unspeakable shall befall you" look. (sighs) Fine. I shall be French but I shall not be happy.
LORELAI: Then you will be yourself. Good choice.
(Michel goes back to the French group.)
MICHEL: Bonjour messieurs. Je m'appelle Miche. Ce soir pour vous aider.
MAN: (laughs) Vous avez faîtt un blague. Très drole! Très drole Michel!
MICHEL: (to Lorelai) k*ll me now.
(Cut to the bake sale at Chilton.)
SOOKIE: OK-- we've got our French fantasies, American treats, and our Italian taste sensations. Well, what do you think?
RORY: Amazing.
LORELAI: Incredible.
SOOKIE: It is good, isn't it? Well, final touch.
(Sookie prepares to light a swan-shaped dessert on fire.)
RORY: Oh, can I do that?
SOOKIE: Whoa, honey, this is a more delicate procedure than you might think, OK?
RORY: OK.
SOOKIE: It takes an expert hand.
(SOOKIE lights the tablecloth on fire. Lorelai fills a cup with lemondae from a nearby table and extinguishes the flames. The women at the lemonade table give her dirty looks.
LORELAI: Um -- hi. Oh, well, gee...what is that, a dollar? Let me find you a dollar. You know what? I'll take two -- I'll drink one. (drinks) Mmm...tasty and flame-retardant.
(Mr. Medina walks up to Lorelai.)
MR. MEDINA: Very Henry the Eighth.
LORELAI: Well we're not into subtle.
MR. MEDINA: Good to see you, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Good to see you, Mr. Medina.
MR. MEDINA: Max.
LORELAI: Mr. Medina.
MR. MEDINA: Max.
LORELAI: Mr. Medina. Meet Sookie, the cheft at the inn. Sookie, Mr. Medina.
SOOKIE: What's your name again?
LORELAI: Mr. Medina.
SOOKIE: I know, you've said it like a zillion times. (to Mr. Medina) Hello.
MR. MEDINA: Hello. Lorelai, could I borrow you for a second?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, sure. (to Sookie) Oh! Hey I'll be right back.
(Lorelai and Mr. Medina walk away from the table.)
MR. MEDINA: You know, Lorelai, I would love for the ice to thaw.
LORELAI: There's no ice.
MR. MEDINA: Well you repeated my full name four times. That's ice.
LORELAI: No, that's not ice, it's wintry.
MR. MEDINA: I was doing my job when I didn't let Rory take that test. I didn't like it but I had to do it.
LORELAI: I know.
MR. MEDINA: And I'd do it again.
LORELAI: OK.
MR. MEDINA: I really do think Rory's a great kid and I'm going to do my damnedest to make sure she gets through Chilton in one piece.
LORELAI: I appreciate that.
MR. MEDINA: And I'd like us to be friends.
LORELAI: We are. Me too.
MR. MEDINA: Yeah?
LORELAI: Yeah. Really, truly, I swear. There's no more ice. We're walking in a pool of tepid water.
MR. MEDINA: Good.
LORELAI: Good.
MR. MEDINA: I'm going to propose something here. I'm not sure how you're going to take it.
LORELAI: Oh wow, intrigue.
MR. MEDINA: I'd like to see you sometime. Away from the ivy, away from the gargoyles, away from here.
LORELAI: Are you asking me out on a date.
MR. MEDINA: Yes.
LORELAI: Mm. Well, uh, I don't want to go out on a limb here, but I'm guessing if the headmaster won't let a kid be thirty seconds late for a test he'd probably frown on a teacher dating a mom.
MR. MEDINA: I do my job well, I'm dedicated to my students, and there's nothing in the Chilton book of ethics that prohibits it.
LORELAI: Yeah but I'm guessing it's sort of an unwritten rule.
MR. MEDINA: Do you want to go?
LORELAI: And Rory would probably freak at the thought.
MR. MEDINA: Do you want to go?
LORELAI: And the other parents would have a field day with this kind of thing.
MR. MEDINA: Do you want to go?
LORELAI: Yes.
MR. MEDINA: Good.
LORELAI: Wait.
MR. MEDINA: What?
LORELAI: No.
MR. MEDINA: Why?
LORELAI: I can't. It's wrong. It's weird.
MR. MEDINA: I'll pay.
LORELAI: You're on.
MR. MEDINA: Really?
LORELAI: I'm kidding. I don't know. You're Rory's teacher.
MR. MEDINA: I know.
LORELAI: Could you quit? Right, that's crazy.
MR. MEDINA: OK, OK. Um...how about coffee? You like coffee?
LORELAI: Only with my oxygen.
MR. MEDINA: Can we drink some together? A sort of pre-date. Very casual, no strings, no obligations. We'll just see if it's even worth going down the road of including food in the deal. (whispers) Just coffee. (normal voice) Decaf? There's nothing safer than decaf.
LORELAI: I'm going to be in town tomorrow because I take a class at Hartford State and there's a coffee shop across the street that I sometimes, almost all the time, go to around 4:00 and usually exactly 4:12. I could not stop a person from entering said establishment around that time, nor would I avoid them if I knew them if they did.
MR. MEDINA: You know the wordsmith thing -- that's something we have in common.
LORELAI: See you around, Max.
MR. MEDINA: Indeed. You will.
(Cut to Lane and Rory walking down the street.)
LANE: Philadelphia.
RORY: Philadelphia? If you could live in any city in the world you'd pick Philadelphia?
LANE: M. Night Shymalan lives there.
RORY: Who?
LANE: The guy who directed 'The Sixth Sense.'
RORY: But what would you do there?
LANE: Hang out with M. Night Shymalan.
RORY: OK, cross 'guidance counselor' off your list of potential career choices.
(They meet Babette, Morey, and Cinnamon.)
BABETTE: Lie still, baby doll, we're almost home.
RORY: Hey Babette.
BABETTE: Hey kids.
(Cinnamon meows strangely.)
RORY: Wow, that sounds bad.
BABETTE: Cinnamon's dyspeptic. So's Morey. Too many clams.
MOREY: Bad clams.
(Babette, Morey, and Cinnamon continue walking.)
BABETTE: This doesn't reflect well on Al's establishment.
LANE: You had clams at Al's?
RORY: Al's Pancake World?
BABETTE: Yeah, well we had a coupon.
RORY: Hmmm.
(Rory and Lane resume walking down the street. Rory spots Dean in the grocery store where he is working.)
RORY: Oh wow! The store! Hey, listen, I have to pick up some stuff, so --
LANE: What do you have to pick up?
RORY: Just some...stuff. So I'll talk to you later tonight.
LANE: I'll go in with you.
RORY: Why?
LANE: Because otherwise I'd have to go home.
RORY: Home is good.
LANE: My home?
RORY: Yeah, actually I don't have to go in.
LANE: OK. Then I guess I will go home.
RORY: Great! Go, bye.
LANE: Bye...freak.
(Lane leaves. Rory walks into the store and watches Dean. He looks over and waves when he sees her. Rory ducks into an aisle and walks to the back of the store where Miss Patty is.)
MISS PATTY: Rory! Hello! Try a plum They're better than sex.
RORY: Um, no, thanks.
MISS PATTY: Fresh fruit always has such a sensuality about it. Are you too young for this?
RORY: Definitely.
MISS PATTY: Well what are you here for honey?
RORY: Oh well, I just --
(Rory looks over at Dean.)
MISS PATTY: Oh, I see what you're here for. Well that wouldn't fit in a basket. No no no no no!
RORY: Patty! It's not like that. He's just a person.
MISS PATTY: A person?
RORY: A boy-type person.
MISS PATTY: Oh, my favorite kind.
RORY: I really don't even know him.
MISS PATTY: Oh, right. You don't know him?
RORY: I don't.
MISS PATTY: You said.
RORY: Please don't say anything.
MISS PATTY: I promise I won't tell a single soul that you don't know that young man.
RORY: Thank you.
MISS PATTY: You're welcome.
(Rory walks away from Miss Patty. A store employee confronts Miss Patty, who has been sampling the produce.)
EMPLOYEE: Excuse me, ma'am, what are you doing?
MISS PATTY: Please, honey, don't call me ma'am. It makes me feel older than 25. Here, have a pea pod.
EMPLOYEE: I assume that you're going to pay for the food you've consumed on the premises.
MISS PATTY: Oh, so brusque. And you are?
EMPLOYEE: I'm the new assistant manager here.
MISS PATTY: Well listen here, my fine friend, who if you had a better hairstyle i might consider dating, I do this all the time.
EMPLOYEE: Not from now on, I'm sorry.
MISS PATTY: Oh, now, wait a minute here. I've been sampling food at this establishment for years.
EMPLOYEE: The next time you put something in that mouth that doesn't belong there, I'm going to remove it and then call the police.
(He takes the pea pod out of her hand and walks away. By now Rory is at the check-out counter. Dean walks over to the end of the counter.)
CASHIER: Is this all you want, honey? A head of lettuce and a mouse trap?
RORY: That should do it.
DEAN: That's a couple of must-need items there.
CASHIER: $2.27.
RORY: I only have a dollar.
DEAN: I could loan you the rest.
RORY: Uh, no, I'll just take the lettuce.
DEAN: Perfect. You could use half of it for a salad then use the other half to clobber the mouse with.
(Rory starts to leave.)
DEAN: Paper or plastic?
RORY: I'm fine.
(She leaves the store.)
(Cut to Lorelai entering the coffee shop in Hartford. She sits at the counter near Mr. Medina.)
MR. MEDINA: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Max! Hi!
MR. MEDINA: Small world, huh?
LORELAI: Absolutely! What are you drinking?
MR. MEDINA: Coffee.
LORELAI: Plain coffee?
MR. MEDINA: I wanted some cream but that prompted a very elaborate foam conversation. And the look of disapproval I got when I said I didn't want foam, just cream, rivaled the one I got from my dad when I told him I wanted to be a teacher.
LORELAI: Wow, so it's been a tough outing for you, huh?
MR. MEDINA: Well it's getting better.
WAITRESS: What can I get you?
LORELAI: Coffee, please.
(The waitress goes to get Lorelai's coffee.)
MR. MEDINA: So, here we are.
LORELAI: Here we most certainly are.
MR. MEDINA: Running into each other.
LORELAI: Away from the school.
MR. MEDINA: And its unique strictures.
LORELAI: These things do happen.
MR. MEDINA: Fate can be funny.
LORELAI: Should we cut the cute and just get right to it?
MR. MEDINA: I think we should date.
LORELAI: Why?
MR. MEDINA: Because I think we both want to.
LORELAI: Well I want to be in the Bangles but that doesn't mean I quit my job and get a guitar and ruin my life to be a Bangle, does it?
MR. MEDINA: The Bangles broke up.
LORELAI: Yeah, that's not the point.
MR. MEDINA: Well it's got to be part of the point if there's no band anymore.
LORELAI: I repeat my question: 'why should we date?'
MR. MEDINA: Because we're clearly attracted to each other.
LORELAI: I'm attracted to pie. It doesn't mean I feel the need to date pie.
MR. MEDINA: OK then because we are --
LORELAI: Yes?
MR. MEDINA: -- of similar heights.
LORELAI: Wow! Round one and already tapped.
MR. MEDINA: Look I know that you are concerned about the appearance of us dating.
LORELAI: Yes I am.
MR. MEDINA: Well I can tell you that I am the soul of discretion when it comes to delicate relationships.
LORELAI: Dated a lot of Chilton moms, huh?
MR. MEDINA: No, I meant any relationships -- work, family.
LORELAI: Oh so you have things to hide in all aspects of your life -- very interesting.
MR. MEDINA: (to waitress) Do you have any hemlock back there? Arsenic, something quick?
LORELAI: Do you like rap music?
MR. MEDINA: Yeah.
LORELAI: Me too. Italian food?
MR. MEDINA: Yeah.
LORELAI: Me too. You just telling me what I want to hear?
MR. MEDINA: Yeah.
LORELAI: I knew it!
MR. MEDINA: Doesn't mean it doesn't coincide with how I really feel.
LORELAI: Yeah but if you're telling me what you think I want to hear then I'm not really getting to know you.
MR. MEDINA: And if I know what you want to hear that shows a level of understanding on my part that far exceeds your understanding of me. (Lorelai doesn't say anything). Who's the one laggin?
LORELAI: Uh...
MR. MEDINA: Wow, round one and already tapped!
LORELAI: (seriously) Rory is my life. She's my pal, my everything. And I would never, ever do anything that would hurt her.
MR. MEDINA: I understand. (A man sits down on the stool between them.) But Rory is not a baby anymore.
LORELAI: Don't say that! She's eight! She's eight and her favorite hobby is making necklaces out of gum wrappers.
MR. MEDINA: You could try stunting her growth, keeping her in a box, blowing cigarette smoke on her.
(The man gives Mr. Medina a strange look.)
MR. MEDINA: You are so taking this out of context.
(The man moves to another seat. Mr. Medina moves into the seat next to Lorelai that the man vacated.)
MR. MEDINA: OK, when my uncle was a young man, there was this girl who lived across the street from him and he was completely in love with her -- but he never talked to her. But he knew in his gut that this was the girl he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.
LORELAI: This is gonna be sad isn't it?
MR. MEDINA: Let me finish.
LORELAI: It's gonna be sad.
MR. MEDINA: So anyhow my uncle watches this girl, waiting for the right moment to approach her. Next thing he knows, he gets drafted.
LORELAI: Oh, going for Kleenex.
MR. MEDINA: No. Now he thinks 'this is perfect. I'll come back, I'll have a career, I'll have served my country, I'll be worthy of her love.' When he gets back -- she's gone. Moved away. No one knew where and he never saw that girl again. Now my uncle, he didn't say much to me, but the one thing he did say was that if there's something in your gut that you know you feel is right you gotta go after it, no matter what. What do you say?
(Lorelai sighs. She takes out a business card and writes on it.)
LORELAI: Maybe dinner wouldn't be so bad.
MR. MEDINA: Dinner? You mean we could sit together? Even drive together?
(Lorelai tosses the card at Mr. Medina.)
LORELAI: Just take the card.
MR. MEDINA: I might frame the card.
LORELAI: Just use the card.
MR. MEDINA: I definitely will.
(Mr. Medina gets up to leave.)
LORELAI: Hey, that story about your uncle -- is that true?
MR. MEDINA: (sighs) Goodbye Lorelai Gilmore.
(Cut to Luke's cafe. Luke serves Lorelai and Sookie.)
SOOKIE: Thank you.
LORELAI: Thank you. (to Sookie) Life is a funny funny thing, huh?
SOOKIE: Yeah I love that Jim Carrey.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Jim Carrey. He's just -- he's just -- funny.
LORELAI: He is funny but I didn't mean funny, funny. I'm being philosophical.
SOOKIE: Oh. Very serious face. Jean-Paul Sartre.
LORELAI: I can't talk to you with that face.
LUKE: How do you guys get any work done?
SOOKIE: So why is life such a funy thing?
LORELAI: I met this amazing guy.
SOOKIE: Goody!
LORELAI: Yeah there's goody stuff about it but there's baddy stuff too. He's a teacher at Chilton. Max -- you met him at the bake sale.
SOOKIE: Oh! He looked good.
LORELAI: Yeah. Right. He's so sexy and smart and funny and he likes coffee.
SOOKIE: God, he sounds perfect for you. Did you get onions?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: (calls to Luke in the kitchen) Hey Luke! You forgot the onions.
LORELAI: I'm just so mixed up though. You know this is a real crossroads kind of situation.It's like 'to perm or not to perm.' I'm really confused.
SOOKIE: For Heaven's sake. (Sookie goes around the counter to get the onions. She starts adding things -- onions and spices -- to the other customers' plates.)
SOOKIE: Go ahead, I'm still listening. You were about to perm your hair.
LORELAI: I just want to do the right thing.
SOOKIE: I'm not sure I see what the problem is.
LORELAI: Oh there are many problems. First -- I do not like to involve Rory in my personal life. I don't want her to have to deal with that. You know, I might bring some guy home and he might not be THE guy but then she gets all attached to him and then all of a sudden I decide that I don't like the way he eats or he hums incessantly or --
SOOKIE: Or the way he smacks his lips or how his hair isn't really his.
LORELAI: Yeah. And then I break up with him and then Rory is the one who gets hurt.
SOOKIE: I totally understand.
LORELAI: This guy is her teacher. I mean, there's no way to keep him out of her life. She sees him every day.
SOOKIE: (to a bearded customer) Are you the open-faced turkey?
BEARDED CUSTOMER: Yep.
SOOKIE: OK, I added a little fresh lemon and a little cayanne pepper. You're gonna plotz! (to Lorelai) You od know that Rory's not a baby anymore.
LORELAI: I know, that's what he said. Maybe I'm being too serious, right? Maybe I should loosen the rules a bit. Plus, be great to get...you know.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: You know.
SOOKIE: No I don't.
LORELAI: You know...he knows.
SOOKIE: (to bearded customer) You know?
BEARDED CUSTOMER: Yeah I know.
(Luke sees Sookie behind his counter.)
LUKE: Sookie!
SOOKIE: Hey. I was just looking for your paprika.
LUKE: What have I said about the counter?
SOOKIE: I know.
LUKE: How the counter is a sacred space. MY sacred space. You don't do yoga on the Dalai Lama's mat and you don't come behind my counter, period.
Luke takes Sookie by the shoulders and walks her back to the other side of the counter.)
SOOKIE: I was trying to help.
LUKE: (to Lorelai) You bring her again and I want her on a leash. I mean it.
SOOKIE: He does make a damn find burger though.
LORELAI: He does at that. Alright I'm just going to keep it simple. I'll tell Rory. If there's even an ounce of weirdenss about it I'll cancel.
SOOKIE: You haven't told Rory yet?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Oops.
LORELAI: No, not oops. The timing hasn't been right. This is a very delicate, fragile situation. It's like one of your souffles. If you don't do it right it's a disaster.
SOOKIE: And you have to order it 45 minutes in advance.
LORELAI: Huh?
SOOKIE: My souffle.
LORELAI: Right, I wasn't but speaking directly about your souffle. I was speaking metaphorically.
SOOKIE: Oh so you don't like my souffles?
LORELAI: How DO we work together?
(Rory rushes into the cafe.)
RORY: Mom you better come.
LORELAI: Honey, what's wrong?
RORY: It's Cinnamon.
(Cut to Lorelai and Rory pulling into their driveway. They cross the yard and go to Babette's. There is a Stars Hollow Animal Hospital van in the driveway. Inside Babette's house, Cinnamon's body is lying on the floor covered by a sheet. The vet is just standing up as Lorelai and Rory enter the house.)
LORELAI: Babette? Honey?
BABETTE: Oh, Lorelai. Come in, come in. She's gone. Cinnamon's gone.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry.
(Rory goes over to Morey and sits next to him.)
RORY: Is there anything I can do for you, Morey?
MOREY: This is life, Rory, it breaks your heart.
BABETTE: She looked like she was sleeping. I thought she was asleep so I nudged her and she didn't wake. I gave her a push and she rolled off the couch and since I waxed the floor she went sh**t' across the room and then she knocked over the lamp and she still didn't move. I knew it was over. Oh, God, my baby.
MOREY: Tell me it wasn't the --
BABETTE: Oh, Morey, don't do this to yourself. He thinks it was the clams.
MOREY: She saw me eating them and she gave me that 'hey, man, what's up?' look and --
VET: It wasn't the clams. Morey, in human years this cat was 260 years old.
LORELAI: That's a good, long life.
VET: Listen, why don't you let me take her out to the van and then I'll get out of your way.
BABETTE: Oh, no, stay. All of you, please stay. Cinnamon would want you here.
RORY: We'll stay as long as you want.
MOREY: I'll never eat clams again.
RORY: Me either.
(Rory pats Morey's arm.)
(Time lapse. Babette's house is now full of mourners, with more arriving all the time.)
LANE: They said that they rolled her body into a lamp.
(Rory nods her head 'yes.')
LANE: Did you laugh?
(Rory shakes her head 'no.')
LANE: Did you want to?
(Rory nods her head 'yes.')
RORY: But it's sad.
LANE: Yeah, it's sad.
(The bearded customer from the cafe walks by as Michel comes through the door.)
MICHEL: Hello? Hello? Where is Lorelai? I'm dropping something off. Yoo-hoo, 'Hee-Haw' man, where is Lorelai Gilmore?
LORELAI: Hey, hey, hey. Thank you. I could not get back to the inn.
MICHEL: What, you are having a party and I was not invited?
LORELAI: Sweetie, it's not a party, it's a wake.
MICHEL: Oh, really? Who died?
LORELAI: Their cat.
MICHEL: You are mourning a cat?
LORELAI: Yes.
MICHEL: They lick their privates, these cats.
LORELAI: Not the comforting chitchat we're looking for here. Goodbye. I'll talk to you later. Thank you.
(Lorelai pushes Michel out the door just as Miss Patty is pushing her way in.)
MISS PATTY: Babette, Morey, I came as soon as I heard. Oh, darling, what do you need?
(Miss Patty grabs Babette and hugs her and presses Babette's head into her large chest.)
BABETTE: A little air, honey!
MISS PATTY: Oh -- oh!
(Outside, Sookie and Luke arrive at the same time, both carrying food.)
SOOKIE: Oh, Luke.
LUKE: Sookie.
SOOKIE: What'cha got in the bag?
LUKE: Bricks.
SOOKIE: Yeah, good one.
LORELAI: Oh, bless you both! Everyone's starved, come in.
(Sookie and Luke both try to go through the door at the same time and collide. They back up and Sookie rushes in before Luke.)
LORELAI: OK, how should we do this?
SOOKIE: Well we need a flow for the room so there's no bottlenecks. People coming in, they're gonna want a beverage. Put 'em on the first table then the smaller hors d'oeuvres next to that, leaving one hand free to greet the people. Then, back there, set up plates and cutlery. First the salads, then the meat dishes, then desserts on the piano bench. How does that sound?
Luke dumps his bags of food on a table in the middle of the room.)
LUKE: Dig in!
(People rush for the food.)
(Time lapse. Rory answers a knock at the door. It's Dean with his arms full of drinks. He has to duck to get in under the low door frame.)
DEAN: Oh, hi, wow. I wasn't expecting you.
RORY: Or me you. I mean, you, me. I mean, come in.
(Dean takes the drinks into the other room. Lorelai walks by.)
LORELAI: Do you know him?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: No?
RORY: Well, he goes to my old school, so I see him there sometimes but I go to Chilton now.
LORELAI: Thanks for the update.
RORY: You're welcome.
(Lorelai leaves and Dean comes back.)
DEAN: Do you have a second?
RORY: No. I have gum.
DEAN: No, thanks, uh, look --
RORY; I have to get back.
DEAN: Oh, sure. I'll see you later.
(Dean leaves. While watching him out the window, Rory sees Mr. Medina at her door.)
RORY: Mom? Isn't that --
LORELAI: Oh, no.
RORY: That's Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: Tonight's Thursday!
RORY: Well, am I in trouble? Did the school call or something?
LORELAI: No, no you're great. I -- um -- let me just come back in just one second.
RORY: Wait -- what's going on?
LORELAI: Let me tell you in a minute.
RORY: Tell me now.
LORELAI: Max is here --
RORY: Max?
LORELAI: Max is here to pick me up.
RORY: Pick you up for -- oh.
LORELAI: I'm gonna go talk to him real quick and I'm gonna be right back.
(Rory looks upset. Lorelai runs outside and over to her own porch where Mr. Medina is still knocking.)
LORELAI: Hey!
MR. MEDINA: Oh, hi.
LORELAI: Hi.
MR. MEDINA: I was knocking but no one answered.
LORELAI: I know. I was at the neighbors' house.
MR. MEDINA: You're cancelling.
LORELAI: I know it's totally last minute.
MR. MEDINA: I'm heartbroken.
LORELAI: I just completely forgot about our date.
MR. MEDINA: And forgettable.
LORELAI: No you're memorable. I've been memorabling all week. It's just -- We had a little emergency.
MR. MEDINA: Rory, is Rory OK?
LORELAI: No, Rory's fine. It's the neighbors' cat.
MR. MEDINA: The neighbors' --
LORELAI: -- cat. She died.
MR. MEDINA: She died.
LORELAI: This was a very fat, very beloved cat.
(pause)
MR. MEDINA: Lorelai. I like you but I don't want to force something on you that you don't want so -- (walks away)
(Lorelai runs after him.)
LORELAI: No, no, no. Wait. No, Max, you're not forcing anything on me. I am telling the truth about the cat.
MR. MEDINA: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Please don't read that much into this. Call me and we'll reschedule. I promise that's what I want.
MR. MEDINA: You're sure?
LORELAI: Cross my heart and hope no other neighborhood pets die on that day.
MR. MEDINA: OK, I'll call.
LORELAI: Good.
MR. MEDINA: Sorry about, uh --
LORELAI: Cinnamon.
MR. MEDINA: Cinnamon.
(Mr. Medina gets into his car and drives away.)
LORELAI: Stupid cat! You couldn't have held on one more day?



(Cut to the wake.)
SOOKIE: Is that meatloaf?
LUKE: Uh-huh.
SOOKIE: You use ketchup?
LUKE: You gonna make fun of my mother too?
SOOKIE: Sorry. You know, my real-fruit puffs would compliment that dish quite well.
LUKE: It's fine on its own, thank you.
SOOKIE: Right.
(pause)
LUKE: OK, toss some on the plate.
SOOKIE: Can I make a pretty design, maybe make some layers?
LUKE: Sookie!
SOOKIE: Right. Tossing them on. Got it.
(Lorelai comes back in.)
LORELAI: You guys, have you seen Rory anywhere?
LUKE: Yeah, I think she headed that way. (points)
LORELAI: OK, thanks.
(The grocery store employee from earlier approaches Miss Patty.)
EMPLOYEE: Excuse me, ma'am?
MISS PATTY: Well if it isn't Kirk the jerk.
EMPLOYEE: I want to apologize for what happened at the store yesterday.
MISS PATTY: I'm listening.
EMPLOYEE: I wasn't aware that you were THE Miss Patty. The owner tells me that you're one of our best customers and you can put anything into that mouth that you want to. Those were his words. I could have paraphrased them.
MISS PATTY: Stop sweating. And close your pores, Kirky, I always forgive.
EMPLOYEE: Thank you.
MISS PATTY: Once.
(Lorelai fins Babette in the kitchen cleaning out a cabinet full of pill bottles.)
LORELAI: Hey, Babette.
BABETTE: Oh, hello, sugar. Can I get you something?
LORELAI: No, I'm fine. I'm looking for Rory.
BABETTE: Oh, I think she might be in the bathroom.
LORELAI: Thanks. (starts to leave then stops) Can I help you with something?
BABETTE: Oh, no. I thought I'd just get some of this stuff packed away.
LORELAI: It's like a scene from a kitty version of 'Valley of the Dolls.'
BABETTE: Yeah. You never realize how old they actually are 'til you look in the medicine cabinet.
LORELAI: Yeah.
BABETTE: These were for her heartworms, for her thyroid, her kidneys, for the rash she got from taking these, and these were for the tic she developed from the stuff for the rash. And these -- oh jeez, these are mine. Damn, I'm gonna miss that old broad.
LORELAI: I know.
BABETTE: You know, I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself now. You live to take care of your kids.
LORELAI: I know, sweetie, but you gave her everything that you had.
BABETTE: I know. She was so tiny when I got her. She could sleep in my shoe.
LORELAI: The other day I came across a hat that I made for Rory. It was like a doll hat.
BABETTE: Oh, they grow up so fast.
LORELAI: And then they take your clothes.
BABETTE: I guess eventually you have to move on. Figure out what your life is going to be when you're not busy taking care of somebody else. Jeez, look at this place. Not a clean glass in sight!
LORELAI: Let me help you with that.
(They start to wash the glasses but the sink is too low for Lorelai. Babette gets a stool for her.)
BABETTE: Here, sugar, use this. Morey sits on it when he helps me.
LORELAI: How does Morey get around in here?
BABETTE: Oh, just fine. He had a couple of concussions his first year here but he never complains. He's just the best thing. I don't know what I'd do without him. (voice breaks)
LORELAI: Oh, Babette. What do you mean 'without him'?
BABETTE: I saw on Oprah a few weeks ago. She had on couples who lost a child. Most of the marriages went belly-up for the pain of it all. Even though they loved each other.
LORELAI: Babette, that is not gonna happen to you.
BABETTE: I never thought a man would ever even want me.
LORELAI: I know the feeling.
BABETTE: Oh, please, with that ass? Gimme a break.
LORELAI: I mean want me for more than my ass. Me -- for me, the whole package. Annoying neuroses and all.
BABETTE: You'll find him. It might even be that stud who drove out of here in a Mustang.
LORELAI: Did you see him?
BABETTE: Yeah, what a jaw.
LORELAI: He's got a great jaw.
BABETTE: How is he in the sack?
LORELAI: I haven't even gone out with him yet.
BABETTE: Will you tell me when how he is when you do?
LORELAI: I'll call you during the cigarette.
(They hug. Lorelai hits her head on a low-hanging overhead lamp. They hear [iano music from the other room.)
BABETTE: Oh -- that's Cinnamon's song.
(Cut to the living room. Everyone is seated or standing quietly listening to Morey playing the piano. Miss Patty is b*at on a drum. Babette goes over to sit with Morey. Lorelai finds Sookie in the crowd.)
LORELAI: Oh I can't find Rory anywhere.
SOOKIE: I'm sure she's around.
LORELAI: Max showed up for the date that I forgot about and she saw him.
SOOKIE: And you haven't told her.
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Oops.
LORELAI: Stop with the 'oops.'
SOOKIE: OK, calm down. It's not that big of a deal.
LORELAI: Her teacher showed up on her porch to take out her mother.
SOOKIE: She'll understand. You're crazy. She knows that.
LORELAI: Enough with the comforting, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Sorry.
(Rory is outside in Babette's yard, surrounded by gnomes. Dean walks up to her.)
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Jeez, you scared me.
DEAN: Yeah, uh, look. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
RORY: For what?
DEAN: Well I've been kind of bugging you lately. Uh, I thought -- I don't know -- I thought that maybe you liked me. But it's obvious that you're not interested so I just wanted to say that I get it and I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
(Dean starts to leave. Rory gets up and follows him.)
RORY: Wait! I AM interested.
DEAN: You are?
RORY: Yes. I gotta go.
(Rory leaves and Dean smiles. As Rory reaches the door Lorelai comes out.)
LORELAI: Oh! Finally. I've been looking everywhere for you.
RORY: Well you found me.
LORELAI: Listen, I have some explaining to do. OK. So sit down in that tiny little chair and I'm gonna do it right now. (Rory sits.) That man on the porch was your teacher.
RORY: Mom, I'm a little behind in school but not so far behind that I don't know who the teacher is. So?
LORELAI: So -- um -- he and I were going to sort of hang out together.
RORY: On a date.
LORELAI: No, on a -- something that could appear like a date to the untrained eye.
RORY: To your daughter's eye?
LORELAI: It was a date.
RORY: How long have you been dating him?
LORELAI: I haven't. This was gonna be the first time.
RORY: And when were you planning on telling me about this -- your wedding?
LORELAI: No -- by the rehearsal dinner at least.
RORY: He's my teacher.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: He teaches me things every day in a very small classroom with a lot of other kids who probably won't be high-fiving me when they find this out.
LORELAI: I knw, sweetie, and I told him this was one of the things I was concerned about.
RORY: And?
LORELAI: And he thought we could be discreet.
RORY: Unbelievable!
LORELAI: Are you mad?
RORY: Yes!
LORELAI: Alright. Because I'm dating him?
RORY: Because you lied to me.
LORELAI: I kept information from you.
RORY: Information that I should have had.
LORELAI: Information that would have come out eventually. Like the Iran-Contra scandal.
RORY: So you're Oliver North.
LORELAI: No, I'm Fawn Hall.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Well, she was much prettier.
RORY: I just can't believe that you didn't tell me about this. Why wouldn't you tell me?
LORELAI: 'Cause I thought you were going to take it bad. Thank God I was wrong. (pause) OK, OK. Listen, I'm sorry. I won't date him. I promise.
RORY: I'm not saying that you can't date him. It's just -- this is weird. I mean -- there's a million guys in this world and you end up with Mr. Medina.
LORELAI: You think I don't get the weirdness factor? Believe me, the last thing I intended to do was date your teacher.
RORY: I believe you.
LORELAI: I really like him, Rory. I can't help it. And it's been a really long time since I've felt like this. You can't always control who you're attracted to, you know. I think the whole Angelina Jolie/Billy Bob Thronton thing really proves that. And I know you don't understand this now but you wil someday. You'll meet some great guy and he'll make your head all foggy and you won't know what to do with yourself. (sighs) Oh, sweetie, I won't keep anything from you again. OK? I promise. From now on every aspect of my life is an open book to you.
RORY: That's OK.
LORELAI: Really, I'm not even going to get dressed until I tell you what I'm thinking of wearing.
RORY: Fair enough.
LORELAI: OK, tomorrow I'm thinking the purple tiger top, the black leather skirt, the panda bear underwear.
RORY: Oh, good.
LORELAI: But of course I'm totally open to suggestions.
RORY: Here's one: get some help.
(Lorelai and Rory are leaving Babette's. Babette and Morey walk them out.)
LORELAI: Let us know if we can do anything.
BABETTE: Oh, you've done too much already.
LORELAI: Good-night, Babette.
(Lorelai hugs Babette.)
BABETTE: Good-night, sugar.
RORY: Good-night, Morey.
(Rory hugs Morey.)
MOREY: Stay cool, Rory.
BABETTE: It's getting late.
MOREY: Let's stay outside a while, baby. Look for the Big Dipper.
BABETTE: OK, I'd like that.
(Morey puts his arm around Babette's shoulders and they watch the sky.)
(The phone rings as Rory and Lorelai walk in their front door.)
LORELAI: Hello.
EMILY: I've been trying to get you all afternoon.
LORELAI: Mom?
EMILY: Yes.
LORELAI: Hi.
EMILY: You already said that.
LORELAI: But someone hasn't.
EMILY: Hello.
LORELAI: There we go.
EMILY: You are impossible to reach.
LORELAI: Well there's no messages on the machine, Mom.
EMILY: I don't leave messages. If I wanted to talk to a machine I'd talk to my VCR. Where were you?
LORELAI: At a wake.
EMILY: A what?
LORELAI: A wake...a funeral.
EMILY: A funeral? Whose?
LORELAI: It was for the neighbors' --
(Rory motions Lorelai not to say it.)
LORELAI: -- cat.
(Lorelai mouths 'what?' Emily doesn't say anything.)
LORELAI: Mom?
EMILY: Hold on. I'm looking up anyuresm in our medical dictionary to see if I just had one.
LORELAI: I just wanted to be honest with you, Mom. Silly me.
EMILY: A cat?
LORELAI: Yeah, a cat. It was a cat's funeral.
EMILY: You skipped your own cousin's funeral for a cat's funeral?
LORELAI: Not my cousin, mom. My father's grandmother's sister's girl who I've never --
EMILY: You said you couldn't be away from the inn.
LORELAI: Well I couldn't at the time bt I worked it out.
EMILY: For a cat?
LORELAI: It's late. I have a big day tomorrow, Mom.
EMILY: Oh, what? You're going to a racoon's wedding?
LORELAI: Good-night, Mother.
EMILY: Good-night.
(Lorelai hangs up.)
LORELAI: Aaagh! She's working for a sedative manufacturer. Keeping that demand sky-high.
RORY: You shouldn't have told her.
LORELAI: Well I don't know what to tell and what to hide.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: So we never did quite settle the whole dating-your-teacher issue. I won't go out with him if you don't want me to.
RORY: You can go out with whoever you want.
LORELAI: It's whoever we want.
RORY: Well I'm certainly not going to go out with him 'cause that would be really weird.
LORELAI: But I mean it. I won't see him if you don't want me to.
RORY: Huh.
LORELAI: You know, if there's anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, big or small, then he's out of there.
RORY: Good to know.
LORELAI: Because you know it's not like I'm desperate. I mean, there are plenty of other guys out there.
RORY: Sure are.
LORELAI: And it's not like I have to ask your permission. I mean, this is a courtesy.
RORY: OK.
(Rory goes into her room and closes the door. On the other side of the door, Lorelai raises her voice to be heard.)
LORELAI: OK, so I'm going to be up for a while, if you want to get back to me on this.
RORY: I know where you are.
(Lorelai starts to leave. Rory opens the door and sticks her head out.)
RORY: Hey, do you think you could keep him out really late on Thursday night because I have this oral exam on Friday that I'd really love him to sleep through.
LORELAI: I'll do my best.

Kiss and Tell
(Lorelai and Rory are walking across the town center. The town is decorated for fall.)
LORELAI: One of us has to do laundry tonight.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Because I haven't had any clean underwear for three days.
RORY: So right now under your skirt you're wearing...?
LORELAI: Not underwear.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: It's kinda nice, actually -- breezy.
RORY: My role model, ladies and gentlemen.
LORELAI: How come you haven't run out yet?
RORY: I don't know. I guess I have more underwear than you.
LORELAI: That's not true. You have less. Have you been doing laundry without me?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Rory?
RORY: OK, one load.
LORELAI: And you didn't even ask if I had stuff to throw in?
RORY: It was a big load. There wasn't any room.
LORELAI: I'm crushed. I'm bleeding. Get me a tourniquet. Oh, no, they're dirty 'cause Rory wouldn't wash them with her stuff.
RORY: I'm sorry. I'll do another load tonight, I promise.
LORELAI: Never mind. I'll do my own laundry.
RORY: Fine, even better.
LORELAI: I hate doing laundry. Maybe I'll just buy new underwear.
(They walk by Miss Patty's dance class having a dress rehearsal for a Thanksgiving dance outside.)
MISS PATTY: And flutter, flutter, flutter, flutter, flutter...and leaves. Where are my leaves? I got pumpkins, I got Pilgrims, I got no leaves.
(Rory and Lorelai enter Luke's cafe.)
TAYLOR: Every other store in town has fall decorations.
LUKE: Hoorah for the mob mentality.
TAYLOR: We're talking a few streamers and a paper turkey. How's it gonna hurt to have a paper turkey?
LUKE: No turkey, no squash, no pumpkins. Nothing colored orange.
TAYLOR: OK, you don't like orange. That's fine. Autumn has many varied hues to toy with.
LORELAI: Excuse me, can we get some coffee please?
RORY: And a muffin?
LORELAI: Warmed?
TAYLOR: This is the Autumn Festival. Your show is right across the street from the Horn of Plenty! You're right smack dab in the middle of everything. You have to decorate.
LUKE: I don't have to do anything but serve food.
LORELAI: And coffee!
RORY: And muffins!
LUKE: Taylor, I'm tired of having this conversation with you every year.
LORELAI: Yoo-hoo!
TAYLOR: You have lived in Stars Hollow for a long time, young man. It's time you became one of us.
(Lorelai waves money to get Luke's attention.)
LORELAI: Whoo!
LUKE: Sorry, I guess my pod's defective.
RORY: Hey. My mom's not wearing any underwear.
LORELAI: Oh!
RORY: Well you aren't.
TAYLOR: You're just being selfish, Luke.
LORELAI: Still they don't notice. I can't take it anymore.
TAYLOR: We're talking about the spirit of fall.
(Lorelai gets the coffee herself and lifts the cover off the muffins.
LORELAI: What kind of muffin do you want?
RORY: Blueberry.
LUKE: You know where you can stick the spirit of fall?
(Luke hands Lorelai a utensil to pick up the muffins.)
LUKE: Here, don't use your hands.
TAYLOR: I don't think you're taking me seriously.
LUKE: What gave you that idea? (to Lorelai, who is leaving) No tip?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, here's a tip -- serve your customers.
LUKE: Here's another -- don't sit on any cold benches.
(Lorelai and Rory walk out the door.)
LUKE: Taylore, I swear to God, if you pull those Pilgrims out of your pocket one more time...
TAYLOR: I'm just doing it --
LUKE No.
(Cut to the street. Rory is geting off the bus from Hartford. She walks into the grocery store. Taylor and Dean are looking at a stack of canned goods.)
TAYLOR: I don't know. It doesn't really look like the Mayflower.
DEAN: Well we could put a sign on it or something.
TAYLOR: I don't know.
DEAN: So do you want to go back to the Plymouth Rock idea?
(Taylor sighs. Dean looks around and sees Rory.)
TAYLOR: We'll just live with it that way for a day.
(Dean walks over to Rory, who is pretending to be interested in cornstarch.)
DEAN: You know, you can get two for three bucks.
RORY: Oh really? Excellent deal.
DEAN: You just had a desperate need for some cornstarch?
RORY: Yes. I have very important thickening needs, thank you. Nice apron.
DEAN: Nice uniform.
RORY: Well, you know, I sewed the buttons on with silver thread so that sets me apart from the crowd. (pause) I guess I should get home.
DEAN: Wait a sec. You want a pop or something?
RORY: A pop?
DEAN: Give me a break. In Chicago they call it pop.
RORY: Well in Connecticut we call it free soda. And yes, thank you.
(They walk over to the soda. Dean hides two cans behind his back.)
DEAN: Alright, guess which is in each hand and you get the soda.
RORY: OK, the whole concept a free soda is that it's free, you don't have to work for it.
DEAN: Sorry you gotta sing for your supper.
RORY: Or your soda.
DEAN: Guess.
RORY: OK, in this hand you have --
(As Rory reaches for the soda behind Dean's back, Dean leans down and kisses her. When he pulls back, Rory is stunned.)
RORY: Thank you.
(Rory runs out of the store, down the street, and into Mrs. Kim's antique store.)
RORY: Lane? Lane?
LANE: What's wrong?
RORY: I got kissed! And I shoplifted. (Rory is still holding the box of cornstarch.)
LANE: Are you serious? Who kissed you?
RORY: Dean.
LANE: The new kid?
RORY: Yes.
LANE: You got the new kid? Oh my God!
RORY: It happened so fast. I was just standing there --
LANE: Where?
RORY: Doose's Market.
LANE: He kissed you in the market?
RORY: On aisle three.
LANE: By the pest spray?
RORY: Yes.
LANE: Oh, that's a good aisle.
RORY: What defines a good aisle?
LANE: An aisle where you get kissed by the new kid is a good aisle.
RORY: Oh my God. I can't breathe.
LANE: OK, sit down.
RORY: No I can't sit down. I'm too -- Oh my God, He kissed me!
(Mrs. Kim comes up to the girls.)
MRS. KIM: Who kissed you?
LANE: The Lord, Mama.
MRS. KIM: Oh, OK then.
(Mrs. Kim moves away from the girls.)
LANE: So? Tell me everything.
RORY: So I go into the store and he offers me a soda. And then he puts two behind his back and he asks me to pick one and then he kissed me.
LANE: I'm so jealous! That's it, I've got to get some dumb, ugly friends.
RORY: I have to go tell my mom.
LANE: Call me later.
RORY: OK.
(Rory starts to leave then stops.)
LANE: What's wrong?
RORY: I can't.
LANE: You can't leave? It's sing your favorite hymn night at the Kim house. Make a run for it.
RORY: My mom doesn't know about Dean.
LANE: So tell her.
RORY: The last time the subject of boys came up it got very ugly.
LANE: Well that was different. She thought you were gonna to quit school over a guy.
RORY: Yes, over Dean.
LANE: OK, fine, but she doesn't have to know it was him.
RORY: She'll know.
LANE: How?
RORY: She's Lorelai, she'll know. What do I do?
LANE: Well maybe she'll be more open to the concept now that you're in school and doing so well and everything.
RORY: Maybe.
LANE: Try it.
RORY: OK. I gotta go.
LANE: Hey, was it great?
RORY: It was perfect.
LANE: Wow.
RORY: Yeah.
(Rory leaves.)
(Cut to Lorelai's kitchen. She's lying half on the floor, half in the empty refrigerator, talking on the phone.)
LORELAI: Yeah, can you hear that? (pause) No, no, it's higher, it's like a high-pitched kind of an "EEEEEE!" sound. It started last week but it was lower and it only happened when we opened the door and now it's higher and it's on all the time so I think it's really, uh, growing in confidence. (pause) OK, look, I've already told this to three other people so could you just please tell me what is wrong with this fridge? (pause) I'm not going to make the noise again. (pause) I'm not --- EEEEEE! (pause) Look, Jerry, I don't have a lot of pride but I do have enough that I do not want to make that noise again, so could you please, tell me what is wrong with the fridge or connect me with someone who can? (pause) Thank you. Hello...Rusty, great. Listen, my fridge is making this weird sound. It's like a high-pitched -- you know what -- actually, is Jerry still there? (pause) OK, have him make the sound. He knows it. I'll wait. (pause) I know! It does sound bad. (pause) OK,here is the deal. You will send someone out here, tomorrow, between the hours of eight and nine, because I work and I can't wait four hours for one of you guys to show up. (pause) Great! Good-bye.
(While Lorelai is on the phone, Rory goes into her room and places the box of cornstarch on her dresser where she can see it then returns to the kitchen.)
RORY: So are they coming tomorrow?
LORELAI: Nope. Monday, between three and eight. I am completely useless.
RORY: Sorry.
LORELAI: Oh my God! Look at this place. It's a sty! Now I'm crabby. I'm crabby and useless. Stupid fridge! Stupid fridge guys! I hate my life.
(Cut to the antique store. Lorelai enters.)
LORELAI: Hello! Hello!
(Mrs. Kim stands up from behind the counter.)
MRS. KIM: Yes.
LORELAI: Oh God! Quite an entrance. Jeez, my heart.
MRS. KIM: Rory's not here.
LORELAI: No, I know. I came to pick up that rocker that I bought a couple weeks ago.
MRS. KIM: Six weeks ago.
LORELAI: Oh, well, OK. Well, that's a couple times three. That's six. (no response) Math humor. Not big with a lot of people. Don't feel bad. (Mrs. Kim walks around the store looking for the chair. Lorelai follows.)
MRS. KIM: This is not a storage facility.
LORELAI: I know, I'm sorry.
MRS. KIM: This is a furniture store. Furniture comes in, people buy, then it goes out.
LORELAI: Right.
MRS. KIM: Except when Lorelai Gilmore buys. Then furniture stays here for six weeks.
LORELAI: How about I pay you extra?
MRS. KIM: I don't want you to pay me extra. I want you to pick up the thing you paid for in the first place.
(Mrs. Kim finds the rocker.)
MRS. KIM: Here.
LORELAI: Huh, I remember it smaller.
MRS. KIM: It's been six weeks. Maybe it grew.
LORELAI: Right, well, once again, I'm very sorry. I've just been very busy.
MRS. KIM: Maybe you should be less busy. Then you can remember to pick up chairs.
LORELAI: Right. Absolutely. Smell a rose, got it.
MRS. KIM: And then you could keep your daughter from running around kissing boys.
LORELAI: What?
MRS. KIM: Lane is a young, impressionable girl. She doesn't need to hear about your daughter's kissing.
LORELAI: Are the lids tight on the paint remover -- because you're sounding a little loopy to me.
MRS. KIM: Loopy? What's loopy?
LORELAI: Rory's not kissing anybody.
MRS. KIM: Yes she is. She came in here and told Lane she kissed a boy in the grocery store. The grocery store! Where we buy our food.
LORELAI: This does not make any -- she kissed a boy in the grocery store?
MRS. KIM: Yes, yes, yes. The boy in the grocery store. Kiss, kiss, kiss.
LORELAI: I'm sorry. I didn't know. (sadly) She didn't tell me. (pause) I have to go.
(Lorelai quickly leaves the store.)
MRS. KIM: You left your chair! (sighs)
(Cut to the town center. Rory and Lane are dressed like Pilgrim women and are working at the canned goods drive.)
LANE: OK, just one more time.
RORY: I've been telling you this story for an hour. It doesn't get dirty.
LANE: I can't help it. I'm obsessed. I'm totally living vicariously through you.
RORY: Why? You got kissed last weekend. Remember? You told me. That guy your parents set you up with. The one with the Lincoln Continental. What's his name? Patrick Cho!
LANE: OK, let's do a little compare and contrast here. You get kissed on the mouth by a cute, cool, sexy guy you really like. And I get kissed on the forehead by a theology major in a Members-Only jacket who truly believes that rock music leads to hard drugs.
RORY: Fair enough. You can live through me. But just remember that I have no idea what I'm doing.
LANE: I'm well aware of that. That's why I've been diligently gathering information for us.
RORY: What kind of information?
LANE: Well, let's see. Dean's from Chicago, which you know.
RORY: I do.
LANE: He likes Nick Drake and Liz Phair and the Sugarplastic and he's deathly allergic to walnuts.
RORY: Walnuts -- bad. Got it.
LANE: Now, he had a girlfriend in Chicago.
RORY: A girlfriend?
LANE: Her name's Beth and they went out for about a year but they split amicably before he left and now she's dating his cousin. Which he doesn't feel too weird about because he doesn't think they were really in love.
RORY: Beth.
LANE: I wouldn't worry about it.
RORY: How'd you get all this information?
LANE: Through his best friend, who, by the way, is really cool. So once you get settled with Dean do you think you could ask him about Todd?
RORY: Oh, absolutely. So, Beth, huh? I hate the name Beth. It's so...Beth.
LANE: Now, Todd also said that Dean hasn't been able to talk about anything but you for weeks!
(They giggle and Rory kisses Lane's forehead.)
LANE: Stop it, you're giving me Patrick Cho flashbacks.
(They laugh.)
(Cut to Luke's. Luke is serving Miss Patty and a female customer seated with her.)
MISS PATTY: Oh, Luke, the food here is lovely but you know what would make it even better?
LUKE: Let me guess: some autumn festival decorations?
MISS PATTY: Well food without ambience isn't really food, is it?
LUKE: More iced tea, Patty?
MISS PATTY: Oh, no, thank you. It's much too depressing in here for tea.
LUKE: You realize Taylor's a head case, right?
MISS PATTY: Yes, but at least he's a festive one.
LUKE: Just eat.
(Lorelai is sitting at a table watching Rory and Lane out the window.)
LUKE: Coffee? (no answer) Aw, come on. Are you mad at me too? I mean, a man can't choose whether or not he wants a picture of a fat, stupid bird on his wall? My God, that's the reason the damn Pilgrims came here in the first place.
LORELAI: Luke, I wasn't snubbing you. I didn't hear you and now I'm concerned about you.
LUKE: Sorry, just feeling a little persecuted lately. Coffee?
LORELAI: Please.
LUKE: You OK?
LORELAI: Yes, I'm fine.
LUKE: You don't look fine.
LORELAI: Well thank you.
LUKE: I just meant you look concerned.
LORELAI: I'm preoccupied.
LUKE: You look concerned.
LORELAI: Well I'm not.
LUKE: Fine, you just look it.
LORELAI: Hey, you know some streamers would look so great in here.
LUKE: OK, I'm done.
LORELAI: Thank you.
(Luke walks away. Rory rushes in and sits down.)
RORY: Sorry, sorry, sorry.
LORELAI: Oh, hey. Save your apologies for the Indians, missy.
RORY: People are really in a giving mood today. The horn of plenty is packed.
LORELAI: That's great. Do you want some coffee?
RORY: Oh, no, I'll just have a sip of yours. I have to get right back.
LORELAI: Oh, really? I thought we were having lunch today.
RORY: I can't. We're one Pilgrim short. I only have a couple minutes.
LORELAI: Oh. You've been really busy lately.
RORY: Yeah. I guess it's that end-of-the-year rush
LORELAI: I mean, we haven't even really talked in a couple of days.
RORY: What do you want to talk about?
LORELAI: I don't know. Anything.
RORY: OK. Did you read that article in the newspaper about the polar ice caps melting?
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. Ooh big deal.
RORY: Fine. You pick the subject.
LORELAI: Oh, OK, great. I was watching General Hospital the other day and you know, they have a new Lucky 'cause the old Lucky went to play something where he could have a real name. So the old Lucky had this girlfriend, Liz, who thought that he died in a fire. So then they bring on this new Lucky and you're all like "OK, I know that's not the old Lucky because the new Lucky has way more hair gel issues" but still, Liz was so upset about his supposed death that you could not wait to see them kiss, you know?
RORY: When do you have time to watch General Hospital?
LORELAI: OK, let's get back to the point. What do you think about the whole Liz/Lucky kissing thing?
RORY: I think they're actors being paid to play a part so it's nice that they're living up to their obligations.
LORELAI: Hmm. Rory --
RORY: Look, can we finish this very meaningful conversation later? I promised Lane I'd get right back.
LORELAI: OK, I'll see you later.
RORY: OK. Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
(Rory leaves quickly. Luke comes back to the table.)
LUKE: I'm not gonna say you look concerned.
LORELAI: I'm not gonna talk about how good you'd look dressed like one of the guys from 'The Crucible.'
LUKE: Fair enough.
(Lorelai goes to the market and sees Dean working. She hides in an aisle and watches him bag groceries. Luke comes in, spots Lorelai, and walks up behind her.)
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: (startled) Oh, God! What are you doing?
LUKE: What are you doing?
LORELAI: I asked you first.
LUKE: I ran out of cream.
LORELAI: Yeah me too.
LUKE: What are you starin' at?
LORELAI: Nothing. Don't look, don't look.
LUKE: What is wrong with you today?
LORELAI: Rory got kissed.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Rory had her first kiss and that guy did it.
LUKE: Ah.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: The new kid.
LORELAI: Yep.
(Luke laughs.)
LORELAI: Oh look at him. Look how smug he is.
LUKE: He's bagging groceries. It's hard to be smug bagging groceries.
LORELAI: Oh look how he just handled those lemons.
LUKE: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: He threw them in the bag. Not tossed them or placed them but threw them like they were nothing to him.
LUKE: They're lemons.
LORELAI: They're symbolic.
LUKE: OK. We need to get you out of here.
LORELAI: No. That' Lothario over there has wormed his way into my daughter's heart and mouth and for that he must die!
LUKE: That's it, let's go.
LORELAI: No.
LUKE: You're not going to k*ll the bag boy.
LORELAI: Why not?
LUKE: It's double coupon day. You'll bring down the town.
(Luke drags Lorelai out of the store.)
LORELAI: OK, OK. I'm out. Stop pushing me.
LUKE: What are you thinking spying on that kid like that?
LORELAI: I don't know. I just wanted to see him. I mean I've seen him already but that was before he was --
LUKE: Rory's boyfriend?
LORELAI: Shush, you.
LUKE: She's growing up.
LORELAI: I know.
LUKE: There's nothing you can do about that.
LORELAI: OK, Mr. Reality, break into somebody's else's house.
LUKE: Sorry.
LORELAI: Why didn't she tell me?
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Why didn't Rory tell me about the kiss?
LUKE: Maybe she didn't know you'd take it so well.
LORELAI: Want to hear something crazy?
LUKE: 'Cause all the talk up until now has been so normal.
LORELAI: He kind of looks like Christopher.
LUKE: The grocery kid?
LORELAI: Yeah. He looks like Christopher.
LUKE: And Christopher is Rory's dad?
LORELAI: The hair, the build, something about the eyes. He reminds me of Christopher.
LUKE: Well that's not too surprising.
LORELAI: You're going to quote Freud to me? 'Cause I'll push you in front of a moving car. This talk was going so well.
LUKE: You and Rory are a lot alike. It's not surprising you would have similar tastes in men.
LORELAI: I guess. But why? Why didn't she tell me? We tell each other everything.
LUKE: This is different
LORELAI: But we tell each other everything else. But this she keeps a secret. It's 'cause it's a guy thing.
LUKE: Probably.
LORELAI: Well that's not good. I have to make her understand that I'm OK with the guy thing. 'Cause not talking about guys and our personal lives -- that's me and my mom. That is not me and Rory.
LUKE: Are you OK with the guy thing?
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: Really?
LORELAI: OK...ish.
LUKE: That's not OK.
LORELAI: Well it's OK with an -ish.
LUKE: Whatever you say.
LORELAI: She just -- she thinks I'll disapprove, right? Well I won't. I will show her that I think this is great. Once she sees that I think this is great, everything will be back to normal between us, right? Right -- OK, good.
LUK:E So you passed the need for an actual person to talk to several minutes ago.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. Before the gelato stand.
LUKE: You're an amazing woman.
LOREALI: Thank you for noticing.
(Cut to Lorelai's house. Lorelai is sitting on the couch. She gets up and looks out the window then runs back to the couch when she sees Rory is home.)
RORY: Hey, sorry I'm late.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, no big deal. There's Chinese in the fridge.
RORY: OK.
(Lorelai follows Rory into the kitchen and stands behind her as Rory opens the fridge.)
LORELAI: So...kissed any good boys lately?
RORY: Who...?
LORELAI: Mrs. Kim.
RORY: (mumbling) Of course.
LORELAI: So, he's cute.
RORY: Yeah, he is.
LORELAI: Can he spell?
RORY: He can spell and read. How long have you known?
LORELAI: Since this morning. You didn't think you were gonna be able to keep it a secret did you? You were making out in the market.
RORY: We weren't making out. It was just one kiss.
LORELAI: Yeah, well by the time that gets to Miss Patty's it's a scene from 9 1/2 Weeks.
RORY: You've known all this time? At Luke's? Here?
LORLELAI: Yeah.
RORY: You could have said something.
LORELAI: Now, funny, I was going to say the same thing to you.
RORY: So...
LORELAI: So...
RORY: What now?
LORELAI: Now? Nothing?
RORY: No? No lecture about kissing a boy?
LORELAI: Why? Did you do it wrong?
RORY: No...I don't think.
LORELAI: I didn't love the way I found out, but you're getting older. These things are bound to happen occasionally. Actually I think it's great.
RORY: No you don't.
LORELAI: Yes I do. I'm thrilled.
RORY: Thrilled?
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: You're completely weirded out by this aren't you?
LORELAI: No. You're crazy. I'm perfectly fine with it.
RORY: You don't seem fine. You seem the complete opposite of fine.
LORELAI: Well you're projecting that on me because you don't want to think that I'm fine when I am, as I have said, fine.
RORY: OK.
LORELAI: Never been finer.
RORY: Got it. You want some?
LORELAI: No, thanks. I'm fine.
(Cut to Lorelai and Rory walking down the street.)
LORELAI: OK, we have to be really quick, 'cause the video store's gonna close, so stick to our list. No impulse buying like toothpaste or soap.
(Lorelai starts to go into the market. Rory stops at the door.)
LORELAI: Rory?
RORY: Hey, I think we have enough stuff to eat at home.
LORELAI: Really...where do you live? 'Cause the home I left this morning had nothing.
RORY: Well we're ordering pizza. That's enough.
LORELAI: Are you crazy? You can't watch Willy Wonka without massive amounts of junk food! It's not right. I won't allow it. We're going in.
(Rory hesitates.)
LORELAI: Rory, it's fine.
RORY: It's too weird.
LORELAI: I'm gonna have to meet him eventually.
RORY: OK. How about next year?
LORELAI: I'm going to be so cool in there you will mistake me for Shaft.
RORY: There will be no interrogation.
LORELAI: I swear.
RORY: No kissing noises. No stories from my childhood. No referring to Chicago as Chitown. No James Dean jokes. No father with a g*n stares. No Nancy Walker impressions.
LORELAI: Oh come on!
RORY: Promise me.
LORELAI: I really and truly promise. Now can we please go to the market?
RORY: OK. Let's go.
(They go in.)
RORY: I don't see him.
LORELAI: All right. Well maybe he's on a break.
RORY: Yeah. Yeah, maybe he's on a break.
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: OK, good. So we can shop.
LORELAI: Yep.
RORY: Do we want marshmallows?
LORELAI: Mmm...and jelly beans and chocolate kisses. Cookie dough we have at home. Peanut butter. Ooh, do you think they have that thing that's like a sugar stick on one side but then you dip it in the sugar on the other side then you eat it?
RORY: We are going to be so sick. It's amazing that we still function. There he is.
LORELAI: Boy, he's tall. That must have been some back-bender, that kiss.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Make sure you warm up next time.
RORY: OK, we are leaving now.
LORELAI: Sorry. Done now. He's got great eyes! You got to love a guy with great eyes.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: And a nice smile.
RORY: Very nice.
LORELAI: Think we can get him to turn around?
RORY: It's nice too.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Trust me.
LORELAI: (to cashier) Hey.
CASHIER: Oh, you girls having another movie night?
LORELAI: Yeah...It's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
CASHIER: Oh, that's nice. Isn't that the one with Gene Hackman?
DEAN: Uh, Gene Wilder.
LORELAI: You're a Wonka fan?
DEAN: Yeah.
RORY: Um, Dean, this is my mom, Lorelai. Mom, this is Dean.
LORELAI: Nice to meet you, Dean.
DEAN: Yeah, you too.
LORELAI: Nice apron.
DEAN: Um...thanks.
CASHIER: Forty-one eighty-three.
LORELAI: Oh, wow. It's expensive to slowly rot your insides isn't it? Here you go.
RORY: (taking the bag from Dean) Thank you.
DEAN: You're welcome.
LORELAI: So, Dean, nice meeting you. Hope to see you again.
DEAN: Yeah.
(Another employee calls Dean away.)
LORELAI: See that wasn't so bad.
RORY: You're right.
LORELAI: I said nothing embarrassing, nothing stupid.
RORY: I appreciate that.
LORELAI: So chill out, Supermarket Slut.
RORY: See, even a little information in your hands is dangerous.
(They leave.)
LORELAI: I need coffee.
RORY: Mom, the video store closes in ten minutes.
LORELAI: Well you run to the video store and I'll go get coffe.
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Go, go, go. I'll meet you at Luke's.
(Rory runs off. Dean comes out of the market.)
DEAN: Hey, you forgot your Red Vines.
LORELAI: Oh, wow! You totally saved the night. Thanks.
DEAN: Sure.
LORELAI: Hey, what are you doing tonight?
DEAN: Me? Uh, well, I don't know.
LORELAI: Well, do you want to come over? We're ordering pizza. We've got a movie. The neighborhood's got a pool going to see who falls into a sugar coma first. I'm the favorite. It might be fun.
DEAN:Uh, well, um...uh.
LORELAI: Oh, it's totally casual. I'm sure Rory would love it.
DEAN: OK, sure.
LORELAI: Yeah?
DEAN: Yeah, what time?
LORELAI: Seven sound good?
DEAN: Sounds fine.
LORELAI: Let me give you our address.
DEAN: That's OK. I know where you live.
LORELAI: Of course you do. So see you tonight.
DEAN: Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
(Dean goes back in. Rory walks back to Lorelai.)
LORELAI: So?
RORY: Got it!
LORELAI: Score! You know, on the one hand I'm glad it was in but on the other hand what kind of world do we live in where no one has rented Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?
RORY: Well we rented it.
LORELAI: Well thank God for us. Oh, hey, I invited your friend.
RORY: What friend?
LORELAI: Dean.
RORY: (upset) What?
LORELAI: Yeah, I told him what we were doing tonight and he was totally into it so -- Why are you looking at me like that?
RORY: You invited Dean? To our house?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: Are you crazy?
LORELAI: Why are you mad?
RORY: Because we haven't even been out on a date by ourselves yet. My first date with Dean is going to be with my mother? Are -- What is wrong with you?
LORELAI: I'm sorry. I thought you would be happy about this.
RORY: In what universe would I be happy? This isn't Amish country. Girls and boys usually date alone.
LORELAI: I don't think of it as a date. I thought of it more as a hanging out kind of session.
RORY: Well I don't want our first hanging out session to be with my mother either.
LORELAI: Stop saying mother like that.
RORY: Like what?
LORELAI: Like there's supposed to be another word after it.
RORY: I can't believe you did this. I'm so humiliated.
LORELAI: You're totally overreacting. I invited him to a movie and pizza, not to Niagra Falls.
RORY: He's the boy that I like.
LORELAI: I know. I looked for one that you hated but it was really short notice.
RORY: And now he's forced to come over and sit with me and my mother and eat crap and watch a movie?
LORELAI: Well I just invited a friend of yours to hang out. What's the big deal? I mean what if Lane had done it?
RORY: You're not Lane. You're my mother. You inviting him over is like Grandma inviting a guy you liked over.
LORELAI: You're comparing me to my mother?
RORY: No, I just --
LORELAI: I'm Emily Gilmore? My, how the mighty have fallen.
RORY: I didn't mean that.
LORELAI: I wasn't trying to humiliate you.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: If I was Emily Gilmore I'd be trying to humiliate you.
RORY: I just --
LORELAI: Look, I'm sorry, OK? I screwed up. I was trying to -- Look, I'll go, I'll uninvite him. I'll tell him that it's cancelled on account of I just found out I'm my mother and I have to go into intensive therapy right now.
RORY: No, you can't uninvite him. He'll think I totally wigged out or something.
LORELAI: Well then I'll just disappear and you guys can be alone.
RORY: Oh, and have it look like my mom arranged a date for me? No!
LORELAI: What do we do?
RORY: He has to come.
LORELAI: It won't be so bad, OK? Just pizza and a movie and hanging out. I promise you won't feel like your mother is there.
RORY: OK.
LORELAI: OK. You might, however, feel like my mother is there.
RORY: Oh, boy.
LORELAI: Well...



(Cut to Rory's bedroom. Rory is wearing a bathrobe and has clothes spread out all over the bed. Lorelai comes in.)
LORELAI: Hey. This is good. Add some cold cream and some curlers and let him know what he'll be coming home to every night.
RORY: This was supposed to be a simple night. Watch movie, eat junk, go to bed feeling sick. End of story. Now I'm supposed to look pretty and girly, which is completely impossible because I'm gross and I have nothing to wear.
LORELAI: Do you want some help?
RORY: No...yes.
LORELAI: OK. Uh...let's see. We'll do this and...
(Lorelai looks over the clothes for a minute.)
LORELAI: All right This says 'hello, I'm hip and cute but also relaxed since this is something I just threw on even though it looks fantastic on me.'
RORY: How'd you do that?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I've been staring at that top for twenty minutes. It was just a top. You walked in and in three seconds, it's an outfit.
LORELAI: It comes from years of experiencing fashion brain freeze like the one you just had.
RORY: How do you do it?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: This whole guy thing. I mean I've watched you when you talk to a man. You have a comeback for everything, you make him laugh, you smile right --
LORELAI: I smile right?
RORY: And then you do the little hair flip.
LORELAI: Oh, twirl. It's a hair twirl.
RORY: And then you walk away and he just stands there, amazed, like he can't believe what just happened.
LORELAI: That's because I just stole his wallet.
RORY: I'll never be able to do that. Trig, I can do. But boys and dating? Forget it. I'm a total spaz.
LORELAI: Listen, the talking part, you just get used to. The hair twirl I can teach you. And the leaving him amazed part -- with your brain and k*ll blue eyes I'm not worried. You'll do fine. Just give yourself a little time to get there.
RORY: Is half an hour enough?
LORELAI: Plenty. Come on. Dab on some lip gloss, clear but fruity. Maybe a little mascara. Wear your hair down and your attitude high.
RORY: You're like a crazy Elsa Klensch.
LORELAI: Oh, thank you! Come on now, hustle. We got a man coming over.
(Cut to the living room. The table is full of junk food. Lorelai and Rory are sitting on the couch.)
RORY: What time did you tell him to get here?
LORELAI: Seven.
RORY: Maybe something happened. Maybe he's not coming.
LORELAI: Maybe he's just late, Miss German train.
(Lorelai goes to the window and looks out.)
LORELAI: Oops.
RORY: What?
(Rory joins Lorelai at the window. Dean is standing in the yard next door talking to Babette. Morey is leaning out the window.)
BABETTE: There used be a great club there called -- what was it called baby?
MOREY: Uh...Mr. Kelly's.
BABETTE: Oh, yeah--Mr. Kelly's. You ever go there?
RORY: They've got Dean.
LORELAI: Wait here.
BABETTE: So, Dean, you like jazz?
DEAN: Sure, yeah.
LORELAI: Oh, he sure does. That's all we ever hear about, right?. Jazz, jazz. Jazz, jazz, jazz. Hey.
BABETTE: Hey, sugar. We were just getting to know your young man, here.
LORELAI: Yeah, I see that. So, Dean, um, would you mind going inside and helping Rory out? There's a struggle with a pickle jar lid that I think she's about to lose.
DEAN: Oh, sure, yeah.
BABETTE: Oh it was nice talking to you, Dean.
DEAN: Yeah, you too.
MOREY: Stay cool, kid.
DEAN: I will.
(Dean goes in.)
BABETTE: Oh, he's so cute.
LORELAI: Yeah.
BABETTE: And that Chuck Heston chin of his. Is he Rory's boyfriend?
LORELAI: No, they're just friends.
BABETTE: That's not what I heard. Kissing at the market. Gives a whole new meaning to tasting day.
LORELAI: OK. I got to get back inside and shower. So I'll talk to you guys later.
BABETE: Yeah, have a good evening. And don't forget to invite us to the wedding. Oh won't their kids be gorgeous!
LORELAI: Oh. God I hope not.
(Cut to the living room.)
DEAN: I'm sorry I'm late. I got here like a half hour ago.
RORY: We believe you.
LORELAI: We'd believe you if you said you got here three hours ago.
(They all stand there for a minute.)
LORELAI: So, Dean, how do you like it here in Stars Hollow?
DEAN: I like it. It's quiet, but nice. I like all the trees everywhere.
LORELAI: Yeah, the trees are something. When Rory was little, she found out that one was called a Weeping Willow so she spent hours trying to cheer it up. You know, like telling it jokes and -- No, I'm sorry that was me. (silence) Would you like a tour of the house?
DEAN: OK.
LORELAI: OK. So this is the living room where we do our living and, um, upstairs is my room and the good bathroom. And the...kitchen is right through here. You ever heard a fridge yodel before?
(Dean goes into the kitchen.)
RORY: (whispers) Thank you.
LORELAI: (whispers) You're welcome. (normal voice) Well you have your basics: microwave for popcorn, stove for storing shoes, refrigerator, which is completely worthless.
DEAN: Interesting.
(The doorbell rings.)
LORELAI: Oh, I'll get that. Rory, you take over as tour guide. Make sure and show him the emergency exits.
RORY: That's my mom.
DEAN: She's got energy.
RORY: Yeah well she's 90% water, 10% caffeine.
DEAN: So what's in there?
RORY: Um, that's my room.
DEAN: Really? Can I see it?
(Rory hovers in the doorway while Dean looks around her room. He picks up a CD.)
DEAN: Wow. Very clean. How much does it suck that they use 'Pink Moon' in a Volkswagen commercial?
RORY: Oh, I know.
DEAN: So you gonna come in?
RORY: Oh, no. I've seen it.
DEAN: I mean you look like you're glued to the door there.
RORY: No -- I'm just, uh, observing my room from a new perspective. You know, I hardly ever stand here. It's really making me rethink my throw pillows.
DEAN: Would you like me to get out of here?
RORY: No, I'm fine with you looking around.
(Dean picks up a stuffed chicken and laughs.)
DEAN: Nice chicken
RORY: Or, you know, at least I was.
(Cut to the front door.)
LORELAI: We do not need dessert, Sookie.
SOOKIE: Oh, everybody needs dessert. So, where is Rory?
LORELAI: With Dean.
SOOKIE: Dean? Oh, that's right, yeah, Dean is here.
LORELAI: Yeah, right. OK. You need to go now.
SOOKIE: Please. I just want one little peek.
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: (stalling) OK, fine, so, uh, how are you? How are you doing? How you doing? Are you --
LORELAI: Sookie.
SOOKIE: I'm concerned.
LORELAI: You're stalling.
SOOKIE: Am I?
LORELAI: Sookie.
(Lorelai opens the door to let Sookie out. The pizza delivery guy is standing on the other side.
JOE: Hey, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hey, Joe. What do I owe ya?
JOE: Fifteen even.
LORELAI: OK. How are you doing?
JOE: Awesome.
SOOKIE: What did you get on your pizza? Did you ask for extra sauce? Because I always ask for extra sauce because sometimes --
LORELAI: Sookie, she's already freaked out that I invited him here. If she thinks I'm parading him around in front of all my friends, she'll k*ll me.
SOOKIE: But I just --
LORELAI: Death, bloody and slow, OK?
RORY: (from her room) Mom, is that the pizza?
LORELAI: Yeah. (to Sookie) OK, bye. Now go.
SOOKIE: Bu I just wanted --
LORELAI: No. Bye.
SOOKIE: Bye-bye.
(Lorelai ushers Sookie --with the pizza-- out the door just as Rory and Dean come in.)
LORELAI: So are you hungry?
DEAN: Starving.
RORY: Where's the pizza?
LORELAI: The pizza's, uh --
SOOKIE: Pizza!
(Sookie comes inside.)
SOOKIE: Just bringing in the pizza. Hi, I'm Sookie. I'm a friend of Lorela's.
DEAN: Hi.
SOOKIE: Hi. Nice to meet you, Dean. I mean, not that I knew you were Dean. But you do look like a Dean. Doesn't he look like a Dean?
LORELAI: Yeah. Of all the people in this room he looks most like a Dean. Bye Sookie. Have fun!
SOOKIE: OK.
(Sookie leaves.)
DEAN: Here, um, I'll take that.
LORELAI: Oh, thanks. Great. The coffee table's fine.
(Dean goes into the living room.)
LORELAI: (whispers) I did not invite her here.
RORY: (whispers) Why didn't you just set up a camera and broadcast it over the internet?
LORELAI: (whispers) Because I don't think that big.
DEAN: Thank God there's good pizza here.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah. Now we didn't know what kind you liked so we just got everything.
DEAN: Everything is fine.
LORELAI: Good, well, while it's hot.
(Time lapse. They are all seated on the floor eating popcorn.)
LORELAI: Who needs more?
RORY: I do.
DEAN: Wow. You can eat.
RORY: Yes I can. Oh that's bad isn't it?
DEAN: No, uh, most girls don't eat. It's good you eat.
LORELAI: I'm all for it.
RORY: Let's talk about something besides my eating habits, shall we?
LORELAI: Oooh -- Oompa Loompas!
RORY: My mom has a thing for the Oompa Loompas.
LORELAI: I don't think finding them amusing constitutes a thing.
RORY: No, but having a recurring dream about marrying one does.
LORELAI: Don't even get me started on your Prince Charming crush, OK? At least my obsessions are alive. You have a thing for a cartoon.
DEAN: Ooh, Prince Charming, huh?
RORY: It was a long time ago. And not the Cinderella one, the Sleeping Beauty one.
DEAN: 'Cause he could dance.
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: I've got sisters.
LORELAI: So, come on, Dean, tell us some of your embarrassing secrets.
DEAN: Well, I have no embarrassing secrets.
LORELAI: Oh, please.
RORY: I bet I know one.
DEAN: What?
RORY: The theme from Ice Castles makes you cry.
LORELAI: Oh, that's a good one.
DEAN: That's not true.
LORELAI: Oh I've got one. At the end of The Way We Were, you wanted Robert Redford to dump his wife and kid for Barbra Streisand.
DEAN: I've never seen The Way We Were.
LORELAI: Oh!
RORY: Are you kidding?
LORELAI: What are you waiting for? Heartache, laughter --
RORY: Communism.
LORELAI: All in one neat package.
DEAN: I'll have to experience that sometime.
LORELAI: Next movie night.
RORY: It's a plan.
LORELAI: I'll get the popcorn.
RORY: Bring in the spray cheese.
(Lorelai leaves.)
DEAN: So, uh, at what point does the outsider get to suggest a movie for movie night?
RORY: That depends. What movie are you thinking of?
DEAN: I don't know...Boogie Nights, maybe.
RORY: You'll never get that past Lorelai.
DEAN: Not a Marky Mark fan?
RORY: She had a bad reaction to Magnolia. She sat there screaming for three hours 'I want my life back!' and then we got kicked out of the theater. It was actually a pretty entertaining day.
DEAN: Yeah?
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: I guess I'll have to come up with a different movie then.
RORY: I guess you will.
DEAN: That Oompa Loompa -- right there. You know when he's dancing?
(Lorelai starts coming back to the living room, sees Rory and Dean sitting side by side, and goes back into the kitchen to read a magazine.)
(Time lapse. Rory tries to get more comfortable. Dean places a pillow behind her back.)
RORY: Thank you.
(Rory stares at Dean but turns away when he looks over at her.)
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: I'll be right back.
(Cut to the kitchen.)
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: What are you doing in here?
LORELAI: Trying to find the best bathing suit for my bust size.
RORY: Well get back in there!
LORELAI: Why? What happened? Did the bag boy try something?
RORY: He's sitting in there and he's watching the movie and he's perfect and he smells really good.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: He smells really good and he looks amazing and I am stupid. I said 'thank you.'
LORELAI: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You said 'thank you?'
RORY: When he kissed me.
LORELAI: He kissed you again? What is he just out of prison or something?
RORY: No, not now. Yesterday. At the store.
LORELAI: Oh, all right. Strike the prison comment. He kissed you and you said 'thank you?'
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Well that was very polite.
RORY: No, it was stupid. And I don't know what I'm doing here. You're sitting in the kitchen. What kind of chaperone are you?
LORELAI: Me? I'm not trying to be a chaperone. I'm trying to be a girlfriend.
RORY: Well switch gears, 'cause I'm freaking out here!
LORELAI: You really like him, don't you?
RORY: Yeah.
LOREAI: Well, OK, then. Just calm down.
RORY: I just don't want to do or say anything else that's gonna be remotely moronic.
LORELAI: I'm afraid once your heart is involved it all comes out in Moron.
RORY: Just please come back in.
LORELAI: OK. Let's go then.
RORY: Wait we can't go back in together though because that would be too obvious.
LORELAI: All right. OK. I'll go in first and you go to the bathroom.
RORY: OK. Good. Tell him I had to wash my face.
LORELAI: Yes. 'Cause of all the sugar you ate.
RORY: Yes! Good. Very good.
LORELAI: OK.
(Lorelai sits on the floor beside Dean.)
LORELAI: Hi. I'm back. Rory went to wash her face.
DEAN: Oh, OK.
(They sit in silence for a minute until Lorelai turns the TV off.)
LORELAI: Dean. I don't know exactly how to say this, but, um, this is a very different kind of household you walked into tonight.
DEAN: Yeah, I know.
LORELAI: See...Rory is my daughter.
DEAN: (rolling his eyes) Ah...here comes the talk.
LORELAI: How about I talk, you listen? Rory is a smart kid. She's never been much for guys so the fact that she likes you means a lot. I don't believe she'd waste her time with some loser.
DEAN: But you're watching me.
LORELAI: Sweetheart, the whole town is watching you. That girl in there is beloved around here. You hurt her, there's not a safe place within a hundred miles for you to hide. This is a very small, weird place you've moved to.
DEAN: I've noticed.
LORELAI: So just know all eyes are on you.
DEAN: Anything else?
LORELAI: She's not going on your motorcycle.
DEAN: I don't have a motorcycle.
LORELAI: She's not going on your motorcycle.
DEAN: Fine, she won't go on my motorcycle.
LORELAI: Curfew will be enforced. You will not detract from her schoolwork, and you're going to start handling those lemons better.
DEAN: What?
LORELAI: Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking. I reserve the right to change, alter, tweak, or add to this list of rules at any given time without any written notice. Am I clear?
DEAN: You're clear.
LORELAI: Good.
DEAN: My turn to speak?
LORELAI: Fine, go ahead.
DEAN: You can lay on all the rules you want and you can have the whole town spy on me and stare at me and chase me through the streets --
LORELAI: Oh I like the chase you through the streets idea.
DEAN: But I'm not going anywhere.
LORELAI: Well it's gonna be a short chase then isn't it?
DEAN: I need you not to hate me. If you hate me then I don't have a sh*t in hell with Rory.
LORELAI: Rory has her own mind.
DEAN: Yeah but you're her best friend and what you think means everything to her and you know that.
LORELAI: I wanna like you. 'Cause Rory likes you.
DEAN: But you don't.
LORELAI: I want to and I usually get what I want.
DEAN: Fair enough.
(Lorelai turns the TV back on.)
DEAN: She's taking a long time on her face.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, Rory's a perfectionist.
(Cut to the front porch. Rory and Dean are leaning against the railing.)
DEAN: Tell your mom thanks for inviting me.
RORY: I'm sorry if this was totally weird. I mean with my mom inviting you over and --
DEAN: Hey, no, it was good. Really.
RORY: Really?
DEAN: Yeah.
(They kiss.)
DEAN: Thank you.
(Dean leaves.)
(Cut to Lorelai's bedroom. She's lying on the bed. Rory comes in and lies down next to her.)
LORELAI: So that went well.
RORY: Yeah, not bad.
LORELAI: Did I humiliate you?
RORY: I don't know. What did you say to him when I went to the bathroom?
LORELAI: That you're pretty.
RORY: Liar.
LORELAI: Yeah...well.
RORY: I'm gonna go to bed.
(Rory starts to leave. Lorelai sighs.)
RORY: Mom, what's the matter?
LORELAI: Nothing.
RORY: Yes there is. Come on, tell me.
LORELAI: Nothing. I just really wanted you to tell me about that kiss.
RORY: I'm so sorry. I really wanted to, I swear. I just got scared and --
LORELAI: I know. I'm not mad. I just wanted to hear about it. That's all. It's no big deal. It's OK, I'm fine. It's one too many Caramello bars. I'm sorry. You have school, I have work, so time for bed.
RORY: OK. Night.
LORELAI: OK, night, hon.
RORY: Mom?
LORELAI: Hmm?
RORY: I know this is lame and totally after the fact but --
LORELAI: Start from the beginning and you leave anything out you die! Where were you?
RORY: OK, I was in the aisle where the ant spray is.
LORELAI: That's a good aisle.
RORY: I know, that's what Lane said too. But anyway, so he was working and I go into the store and I sort of walked around and was pretending to shop...

OPEN AT TOWN MEETING
MISS PATTY: This town meeting will come to order.
TAYLOR: No one is listening to me.
MISS PATTY: Oh, Taylor, calm down.
TAYLOR: I can't calm down, I'm being persecuted.
MISS PATTY: I promise that we hear you.
ANDREW: We've been hearing you for 20 minutes.
TAYLOR: Well, excuse me Andrew, but some of us have businesses to run that don't involve peddling drug paraphernalia to kids.
ANDREW: It was a lava lamp, Taylor.
TAYLOR: There is no use for a lava lamp unless you're on drugs.
ANDREW: Oh for crying out loud.
MISS PATTY: Now we've already agreed to look into your accusations, lets just move on. . .
(Lorelai slides into her seat next to Rory, carrying food and drinks.)
Lorelai (whispers to Rory): What did I miss?
RORY: Taylor Doose wants the no parking zone in front of his store removed. He says his customers are being unfairly ticketed.
LORELAI: No, its just because he wants to park there all day.
RORY: Genius.
MAYOR: I have been mayor of this fine town for a long time. I tend to think of all of you as my children. Unfortunately sometimes children have to be disciplined. Now I'm going to say something and I'm only going to say it once. We have leash laws people.
LORELAI (whispers to Rory): Daddy's getting angry.
MAYOR: Rover will not leash himself.
R: Hm, good point.
MAYOR: I would like to now move on tom something of even greater importance. As you all know this coming Friday is the anniversary of the legendary battle of Stars Hollow. (applause)
L (whispers): Where's Luke?
R: Up there.
MAYOR: Penny will be circulating a sign up sheet for those of you who would like to participate in the reenactment of foresaid battle.
R (whispers): He's turning red.
MAYOR: All right. It was a frigid November night, some 224 years ago.
L (whispers): He's shifting in his seat
MAYOR: The brave stars hollow militia stood in wait for the Red Coats.
R (whispers): He's adjusting the cap.
L: Ooh!
MAYOR: Tired and Hungry, twelve proud men took their positions in the Town's Square, braving the elements . . .
L (whispers): He's fighting the urge, he's fighting the urge.
MAYOR: . . .and imminent death in their valiant efforts. . .
LUKE: Oh for God's Sake, do we have to go through this every damn year!
L: Yesssss!
R: And the urge wins by a long sh*t.
LUKE: I thought we were here to discuss town issues.
TAYLOR: This is a town issue.
MAYOR: Excuse me, who's talking?
LUKE: Its me Harry, Luke, you've known me since I was 5 years old.
MAYOR: Oh, Luke, yes. Sit down. Now as I was saying, twelve heroic men assembled with g*n drawn ready to meet their maker.
LUKE: What are you talking about? Twelve guys stood in a row all night.
MAYOR: Waiting for the Red Coats.
LUKE: Who never showed!
MAYOR: Now just a minute!
LUKE: Twelve guys stood in a row all night waiting for an enemy that never showed. They got stood up. They should've been wearing prom dresses.
TAYLOR: I've had just about enough of this.
LUKE: Sit down Taylor.
TAYLOR: Menace.
LUKE: Suck up.
L (whispers to R): Five bucks says somebody ends up in a headlock.
R: You're on!
LUKE: Have any of you ever considered the fact that you're glorifying a w*r we fought so we could keep land that we stole?
MAYOR: If you don't like it here in America, why don't you go stand in line for toilet paper in the USSR.
LUKE: There is no more USSR, Harry.
L (whispers to R): A sense of community is so important isn't it?
R: Its what made our country great.
MAYOR: . . . .that is a known fact, is you're so interested in facts!
(Opening Credits)
(Fade to Lorelai lying in bed in the middle of the night. She gets up, walks downstairs into the LIVING ROOM, opens the window, smells the air, then walks over and pushes play on the answering machine. She brings the answering machine over to the couch as a message plays from Max.)
MAX: Lorelai, it's Max. Medina. Maaaax Medina. And once again we miss each other. It's now 2 o'clock in the afternoon on Thursday and I'm in my office grading a paper entitled "Emily Dickinson: Get a life." Anyhow as I sit hear losing my faith in mankind, I wonder if we're ever gonna actually go on that date we talked about many moons ago. I teach a night class in Stamford twice a week, and when I pass that Stars Hollow sign on the turnpike, I think out there is a beautiful women that I someday hope to spend time with. Anyhow, I'm just thinking about you, and I don't know, maybe next week we can find some time. Goodbye Lorelai. Gilmore. You knew that. Okay, bye. (Lorelai pushes play again) Lorelai, it's Max. Medina. Maaaax Medina. And once again we miss each other. . .
(Rory comes out of her bedroom and walks to the living room)
R: Mom?
L: (turns off the message) Sorry!
R: What are you doing up?
L: I couldn't sleep.
R: Its freezing in here. (Rory walks over to shut the window)
L: Wait, close your eyes and breathe. (Rory closes eyes and breathes) I smell snow.
R: Oh, it's that time of year.
L: Can't you smell it?
R: You know, its like dogs and high pitched noises. I think its something only you can smell.
(Rory sits down next to Lorelai on the couch and pulls a blanket over the both of them)
L: I love snow.
R: Really, I had no idea.
L: Everything's magical when its snows, everything looks pretty. The clothes are great. Coats, scarves, gloves, hats.
R: Thermal underwear, wool socks, ear flaps.
L: Do you know the best things in my life have happened when it snowed?
R: Why yes I do.
R: My best birthday.
L: Your first kiss.
L: Your first steps, they all happened when it snowed.
R: Feet. (pulls blanket over their feet)
L: I feel good. Tingly.
R: That's called frostbite.
L: Tsk. You are mocking your mother, the woman who birthed you.
R: I'm sorry.
L: During a snowstorm, might I add.
R: So how soon is it supposed to hit?
L: Hmm. Tomorrow. Definitely tomorrow.
R: Okay, then tomorrow it is.
L: What?
R: You, me, donuts, coffee, standing out in a snowstorm. . .
L: At midnight?
R: At midnight.
L: You are my favorite daughter!
R: So how many times are you gonna listen to that?
L: 'Til it stops being sexy.
R: Stop! That's my teacher you're talking about! I have to respect him.
L: Okay, well if it makes you feel any better, while he's being sexy, he's also being grammatically correct?
R: Better. Thank you.
L: Sorry I woke you up.
R: That's okay. Its all fodder for the tell all. Goodnight.
L: Goodnight.
(Rory walks back into her bedroom. Lorelai pushes play on answering machine and hides under the covers)
MAX: Lorelai, it's Max. Medina. Maaaax Medina. . .
CUT TO LOBBY OF INDEPENDENCE INN
L: Hey, how is it out there?
MICHEL: It is cold and gray like a fat dead pigeon.
L: Oh, we'll need to pull out the sleds, people might want to sled. Ooh, and the parkas. We'll need the parkas.
MICHEL: For what?
L: In case anyone wants to hike.
MICHEL: You do know that not everyone finds the idea of being pelted with frozen water appealing.
L: I know, and how sad for them.
MICHEL: The thrilling sensation of getting lost in a blizzard, of freezing to death in the woods, and having to eat your friend's buttocks to stay alive, that is lost on many people.
L: I am telling you, five minutes in a snowball fight we could knock that stick right out of your butt.
(Sookie comes out of the kitchen)
SOOKIE: Okay! How does this sound? Maple sugar snowflakes on all the pillows.
L: Oh that's sounds wonderful!
MICHEL: Make them in the shape of a buttock, get people used to them.
SOOKIE: Okay, is that a real suggestion?
L: Sookie, please, who is speaking?
SOOKIE: Michel, right, okay. Snowflakes it is!
(Sookie goes back into the kitchen. Rory and Lanewearing a full band uniform with hat--enter the Inn.)
LANE: I just can't believe it. I mean, I sat next to him at practice for months, and then one day I look over and it's Rich. Rich Bloomingfeld.
RORY: Where is my chemistry book? I had it at your house yesterday, didn't I?
LANE: Rory, focus please.
RORY: I'm sorry. I just can't find my book.
L: Hey babe. Sergeant pepper.
R: Mom, do you know where my. .
L: Big scary chemistry book is? Behind the desk.
R: Oh thank God. (Goes to get the book)
(Lorelai stares at Lane's band outfit.)
L: Wow.
LANE: Yeah.
(Rory returns with the book)
R: So, is Sookie in the kitchen?
L: And there she'll stay.
R: Okay, so where were we?
LANE: I just met my soul mate.
R: Right, Rich Bloomingfeld. Does he still wear the Star Trek Shirt?
CUT TO KITCHEN OF INDEPENDENCE INN
(Sookie is talking to another Chef at the stove about a pot of water.)
SOOKIE: Now remember you do not take your eyes off this for a minute 'cause the second you do it will boil and then it's ruined. So, just stand there and stare at it. Okay?
(Rory and Lane enter the kitchen)
RORY: Hey Sookie!
SOOKIE: Hey kitty cats. Cinnamon buns are over there.
R: Do you have any of those rocky road cookies that you made yesterday?
SOOKIE: I can scrounge some up. Lane, you need a bag?
LANE: No thank you.
SOOKIE: You staring?
CHEF: I'm staring.
SOOKIE: Thank you.
LANE: So anyhow, Rich has this amazing hair.
R: Really?
LANE: Oh my god. It's so perfect. It's thick but it's not too thick. And it's got really good natural wave, so he probably uses way less product than most guys.
R: Always a plus. Hey, what time is it?
LANE: I don't know
R: I have to get to the bus stop. Dean's meeting me there.
LANE: But I'm trying to talk to you about this.
R: I know, we'll talk on the way.
SOOKIE: Here you go. (hands Rory bag of cookies)
R: Thank you Sookie.
(Lorelai enters kitchen)
L: Hey sweets. I have a locksmith coming to the house today like five-ish, and I don't know how long it'll take, so will you tell grandma and grandpa that I'm gonna be late and that I'm having Satan's baby. You pick the order.
R: I'll relay the time message but I'm leaving the rest up to you.
(Lorelai grabs the bag of cookies that Rory was carrying)
L: What is this? You hate rocky road cookies?
R: I do not. (She grabs the bag back.)
L: Oh I'm sorry. That must be my other daughter Schmory.
R: We're leaving now.
L: Wait a minute. I know who likes rocky road cookies.
SOOKIE: Who?
L: Dean. They're for Dean.
SOOKIE: She's bringing baked goods to a boy. Wow. Serious!
L: (in high voice) "Here Dean, these cookies are for you, 'cause you're keen."
R: Stop.
SOOKIE: Rory's in love!
L: Love, love, love, Dean, Dean, Dean!
SOOKIE: (singing) The cookies for the love and the dean and the cookies for the love and the dean and the cookies for the love and the . . .
L: (singing) Dean and the love and the Dean and the love and the Dean and . . . . . okay, we can stop, she's gone now.
SOOKIE: But it's fun.
L: Well, you're on your own.
SOOKIE: (singing) The cookies for the Dean and Rory and the cookies for the love with the Dean. . .
CUT TO LANE AND RORY WALKING OUTSIDE
LANE: I just can't believe it. I mean, I've known him since the sixth grade, but suddenly he's different. He's not gangly anymore. You remember how gangly he was?
RORY: I'm sorry, what?
LANE: You're not listening to me.
R: I am, I'm sorry. I just couldn't find my bookmark. Okay. Go ahead.
LANE: Okay, here are the problems facing the whole Bloomingfeld-Kim situation.
R: One, hyphenation would be a pain.
LANE: Two, he's my band partner. Romance would be completely awkward. Three, he's never even looked at me like I'm a girl or something resembling one. (Lane and Rory sit on a bench) Four, there's no way I could convince my parents he was Korean. But I can't help it. I'm obsessed. Did I tell you about his hair?
R: It's on his head, right?
(Dean, from behind the bench, leans in between the two of them)
DEAN: Hi.
R: Hi!
DEAN: Lane.
LANE: Dean.
DEAN: Nice hat. (Dean sits on the bench and hands Rory a book) Here.
R: Oh, how'd you like it?
DEAN: Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to k*ll you.
R: Aha! You liked it! You liked Jane Austen. I knew you would! Lane, Dean likes Jane Austen.
LANE: Wow, who would've thought.
R: I told him he would. But he was all, forget Jane Austen, you have to read Hunter Thompson.
DEAN: You do have to read Hunter Thompson.
R: Not as much as you needed to read Jane Austen.
DEAN: Yeah, yeah. Hey what's that? (picks up the bag of cookies)
R: Just some cookies.
DEAN: Rocky Road.
R: Yeah.
DEAN: Wow, she brings me cookies. How can I repay her?
R: How about a little Charlotte Bronte?
DEAN: How about something else? (Gives Rory a kiss)
R: That's good too.
LANE: Okay, I gotta go. I am going to be late for homeroom, and I have that perfect attendance certificate in my sights.
RORY: See you later.
LANE: Yeah, see ya.
INDEPENDENCE INN
(Lorelai walks in through the front door towards the front desk)
L: Ladies and Gentlemen, we have flakes. Flakes have been sighted. Flakage, if you will, has g*n. Michel, it's the first snowfall of the season. It's very lucky. Make a wish.
MICHEL: Get away from me.
L: Oh, you're not supposed to say it out loud.
(Michel goes to answer the ringing phone)
L: The world changes when it snows. It gets quiet. Everything softens.
MICHEL: (handing Lorelai phone) It's your mother.
L: And then the rain comes. Hi Mom.
EMILY: Have you seen the news?
L: Ever?
EMILY: A bad storm is heading your way. It's already hitting us here.
L: Well, don't panic. Ill get the ark. You get the animals.
EMILY: I just sent Lance to pick up Rory at school. The roads are terrible, black ice everywhere, it's just a mess out there. I hate this kind of weather. So anyhow, what time will you get here?
L: Well, uh, gee mom, I don't know, let me see. Black ice, treacherous roads. I guess I'll just put on my red, white, and blue leotard, grab my golden lasso and fly the invisible plane on over.
EMILY: You're not coming?
L: Well, if it's as bad as you say it is, I don't see how I'd get there.
EMILY: Well, I guess it'll just be the three of us then.
L: I guess so.
EMILY: And you know, Rory should probably spend the night tonight also.
L: Okay.
EMILY: And if it's still bad tomorrow. .
L: Mom, why do you wait to see what the weather does before you fill out a change of address card for her.
(Rory enters Emily's living room)
R: Hey Grandma.
EMILY: Rory's here.
L: Put her on a sec.
EMILY: (hands phone to Rory) It's your mother.
R: Hey.
L: Hi. Things bad out there, huh?
R: It's crazy. There's snow coming down everywhere. And let me just tell you, saddle shoes are not the best all weather footwear.
L: Aw. You fell.
R: Twice.
L: Yikes. I'm sorry.
R: So what's the deal? Are you coming over tonight?
L: No, I guess I'm pretty much stuck in the Hollow tonight.
R: Bummer. Well, we can take our snow walk tomorrow night?
L: Absolutely. All right, now, honey, tell Grandma that you arrived there not a member of the junior league, I'd like you to leave the same way.
R: Call if you get lonely.
L: I will. Bye.
CUT TO FRONT OF LUKE'S DINER.
(It's nighttime. The reenactors are walking by Luke in front of the diner.)
LUKE: Harry, come on, stop this before somebody drives through town and thinks the local mental institution has bad padlocks.
HARRY: Luke, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Your father was a reenactor.
LUKE: Yes, and I thought he was crazy also.
TAYLOR: Who's stepping on my musket?
KIRK: That would be me.
TAYLOR: Well, stop it.
(The reenactors walk towards their standing area. Lorelai walks over to Luke)
LORELAI: There goes the fire chief, the police chief and the one paramedic with a valid license. I feel safe, don't you?
LUKE: Look at them, all relatively intelligent men, but there they are dressed up in costumes, standing out in a snowstorm and for what?
L: Because it's tradition.
LUKE: Tradition is a trap, it allows people to stick their head in the sand. Everything that passed was so quaint, so charming. Times were simpler. Kids didn't have sex. Neighbors knew each other. It's a freaking fairy tale. Things sucked then too. It just sucked without indoor plumbing.
L: I think some traditions are nice. Birthdays. Holidays. Taking a walk in the first snow of the season.
LUKE: I didn't get the Hallmark card for that one.
L: When I was five, I had a really bad ear infection and I had been home in bed for a week and I was very sad. So I wished really hard that something wonderful would happen to me. And I woke up the next morning and it had snowed. And I was sure that some fairy godmother had done it just for me. It was my little present.
LUKE: Your parents never explained the concept of weather to you?
L: I'm making a point, Mouthy McGee. Of course, many years later, I realized that logically, the snow was not there for me personally. But, still, when it snows, something inside me says, 'hey that's your present.' I don't think it'll ever change.
(Luke watches the reenactors)
LUKE: My father used to be one of those guys.
L: Yeah?
LUKE: Yeah, even had his own musket.
L: Really.
LUKE: Never had to rent it.
L: Where is the musket now?
LUKE: He was buried with it.
L: Wow.
LUKE: Yup. He loved that musket.
L: That's nice. . . in a disturbing sort of way.
LUKE: Come on in, I'll get you some coffee.
L: No thanks. I'm gonna walk around. Enjoy my present a little.
CUT TO THE FRONT OF A SCHOOL
(A group of band students, all in uniform, are standing around)
BAND TEACHER: People, people, please get into formation. Hats on and instruments in place. Do not, I repeat do not, actually put instruments to your mouths until we are inside. Remember what happened to the flautist last year.
(A band student is kneeling on the ground getting out his instrument. His hair falls into his face, so Lane reaches down and runs her finger through his hair. He gives her a funny look and other kid around her start laughing. She grabs her stuff and runs away.)
CUT TO LORELAI
(Lorelai is walking down a sidewalk. She stops when she sees Max Medina in front of the auto repair shop up ahead. They smile at each other.)
LORELAI: I smell snow. (Walks over to Max)
MAX: Well well well.
L: What's up Teach?
MAX: What are you doing here?
L: I live here. What are you doing here?
MAX: I was on my way back from Stamford, and my car decided to stop.
L: Here?
MAX: Yes.
L: In my town?
MAX: Yes.
L: Good car.
MAX: Its nice to see you.
L: You too.
MAX: You know, a minute ago, I was really angry about something and now I just can't remember what it was.
L: Well that's snow for you.
MAX: I guess so.
L: So, this is quite a predicament you're in. Stranded here in a strange town with no one you know. Oh wait. . .
MAX: Where's Rory tonight?
L: She's in Hartford with her grandparents.
MAX: That must be nice.
L: Whatever you say.
MAX: So Rory's in Hartford.
L: Yes.
MAX: And I'm in Stars Hollow.
L: Correct.
MAX: And you are. . . .
L: Trying to figure out where I should take you.
MAX: No, no, no, no, where I should take you.
L: This is my town. You know nothing around here.
MAX: No, but I was the one who asked you out initially, so therefore I am still obligated to do the taking.
L: Yes, but I was the one who did the canceling after you did the asking, therefore you forfeit your taking rights to me, the cancellor.
MAX: So we're actually gonna do this?
L: Yes we are.
MAX: Let me just give this guy my keys and we'll go.
L: Great.
MAX: Great's an understatement.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
EMILY: (on phone) Well, I just don't understand why you waited so late to call. . . Are you sure? . . . .Fine. . .All right, yes, goodbye. (hangs up phone) Well, I don't know what I'm going to do now.
RICHARD: What's the problem Emily?
EMILY: The problem is that apparently Florence cannot get here because of the storm.
RICHARD: Florence?
EMILY: Our cook.
RICHARD: Ah. Well, we'll just have to go out then.
EMILY: Oh, please Richard, pay attention. We can't go out. It's miserable out there.
RICHARD: Well, we'll figure something out then.
EMILY: What? What will we figure out?
RICHARD: Well, I don't know but. . .
EMILY: I hate the damn snow.
RICHARD: Emily, calm down.
EMILY: This is a serious problem. These Friday dinners are the only proper food that child eats all week.
RICHARD: Rory, are you in any way malnourished or in need of some international relief organization to recruit a celebrity to raise money on your account?
R: I'm good.
RICHARD: She's good, Emily.
EMILY: Your sense of humor rears it's ugly head at the oddest of times Richard.
RICHARD: Emily, I am not the mastermind behind some great scheme to spoil your dinner plans and I don't care to be treated as such.
EMILY: So you're fine with having no dinner tonight, is that it?
RICHARD: I certainly am not.
R: Hey, how about I check the fridge? I'm sure there's something in there we could whip up.
EMILY: Whip up?
R: Yeah, come on. It'll be fun, I promise.
EMILY: Well, come on 'Mister We'll Figure it Out'.
CUT TO EMILY'S KITCHEN
(Rory, Emily and Richard are looking in the fridge)
EMILY: Nothing.
RICHARD: Not a blessed thing.
RORY: Hey, there's frozen pizza.
EMILY: How in the world did that get there?
R: Maybe you bought it and forgot about it.
EMILY: I have never bought frozen pizza. It must belong to Anna.
RICHARD: The maid.
EMILY: Yes.
RICHARD: Ah, got one.
(Rory pulls out the pizza)
EMILY: What are you doing?
R: I'm gonna make it.
EMILY: Oh, Rory, you're not serious.
RICHARD: That hardly looks like dinner.
EMILY: I agree. Rory, that's food you eat at a carnival. Or in a Turkish prison.
R: I promise you're gonna love it.
EMILY: But. . .
R: Listen, just leave it up to me. You guys go back into the living room and I'll call you when it's ready. . . . . Hey Grandma?
EMILY: Yes
R: What are the odds of you knowing where a cookie sheet would be?
RICHARD: I'd say very slim.
R: Never mind. I'll find it.
EMILY: Very slim? Thank you for that.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
(Lorelai and Max are at takeout window.)
L: Thank you. Hold that. Thanks.
MAX: Thanks.
(Holding bags and drinks, they start walking down the sidewalk)
L: God, it's a beautiful night, huh?
MAX: Yes it is.
L: So, tell me something about yourself.
MAX: Like what?
L: Uh, have you ever been married?
MAX: Nope.
L: Ever been close.
MAX: Once.
L: And?
MAX: She's in Thailand now.
L: Sex trade?
MAX: Bank of America.
L: Well, it's usually either one or the other.
MAX: She went there on business, she did well, she never came back.
L: Aw, sad.
MAX: Well, it was at the time, but if it was meant to be . . .
L: Ah, he believes in fate.
MAX: Fate, poetry, love. They all go together don't they?
L: Yes, they do.
MAX: How about you?
L: Oh, I've never been married.
MAX: Ever been close?
L: Uh, Rory's dad proposed.
MAX: What happened?
L: The bell rang? I was late for chem lab?
MAX: Ever sorry that you didn't?
L: Oh, no. We were so young, and my life would've been completely different. You know, I wouldn't live here, I wouldn't work here, I wouldn't be walking here with you.
MAX: Where are we going?
L: You'll see.
MAX: Are we gonna get there before we freeze?
L: Now, what kind of fun would it be if I told you the answer.
MAX: You're crazy.
L: Very possible
MAX: And I'm following you.
L: Yes, you are.
MAX: So possibly I'm crazier than you are.
L: Again, very possible.
MAX: A match made in heaven.
L: Or in Bellevue.
MAX: Must be fate.



CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Rory is staring out the window, bored. Emily is on the couch. Richard is walking around talking on the phone)
RICHARD (on phone): Oh, this is getting ridiculous Aaron. . . I will not continue to have these conversations with a child . . . Yes, he is a child. . .Well, when he's worked 30 years at the company that's when he's not a child. Until then I don't care what his opinions are . . . Aaron are you listening to me? Good, because I'm hanging up on you now. And I wanted to make sure that you heard it. (hangs up) What a moron.
(Rory gets up and goes upstairs and starts browsing around in Lorelai's old bedroom. She finds a strip of photos of her mom and dad. She puts them in her pocket. Her pager goes off. She calls her house, where Lane answers the phone.)
RORY: Hello?
LANE: Rory?
R: Lane?
LANE: Where are you?
R: I'm at my grandparents. What are you doing at my house?
LANE: Like you care.
R: What are you talking about?
LANE: You're never around when I need you.
R: Well you know I have to go to my grandparents on Fridays.
LANE: I know. You go to your grandparents. You go to Chilton. You have to meet Dean. He needs his cookies. I can't find my books.
R: What are you talking about?
LANE: What good is it to have a best friend when she's never around and she never listens and she has no interest in the fact that you're in love or that you touched his hair.
R: You touched whose hair?
LANE: Rich. Bloomingfeld.
R: Why would you touch Rich Bloomingfeld's hair?
LANE: Why? That's a good question. I don't know why. Why would a sane person do a thing like that? Maybe I'm not sane. Maybe I'm going through some sort of phase. Maybe I really really needed someone to talk to about this and you weren't there.
R: Lane, come on.
LANE: No, you come on. You're always at school or you're talking about school or you're with Dean. You have everything now and I have nothing except for 2000 Korean bibles and a potential 'F' in jazz band.
R: I'm sorry.
LANE: Don't be sorry. Be here.
RORY: I . . .Lane? Are you there?
LANE: Rory? Rory?
RORY: Lane?
(Emily walks into the bedroom)
EMILY: There you are.
R: I think the phones went dead.
EMILY: It's probably just this horrible storm. You must come downstairs immediately.
R: What's wrong?
EMILY: The stove is buzzing.
R: It's just the timer Grandma.
EMILY: I know it's the timer Rory. What I don't know is where its located or how to turn it off.
RORY: But I really need to call Lane back.
EMILY: There's nothing you can do now. The phones will come back on eventually. Now please come downstairs and help me stop the buzzing.
R: But. . .
RICHARD: (calls from downstairs) Emily, for heaven's sake get down here!
R: Okay, let's go.
CUT TO "BLACK AND WHITE AND READ BOOKSTORE"
(Lorelai and Max are on a couch while a movie is playing.)
L: So, the fiesta burger. .
MAX: Very interesting.
L: Very spicy.
MAX: Oh yeah.
L: How's your tongue?
MAX: Much better, thank you.
L: Are you scared yet?
MAX: Not yet.
L: Are you scared yet?
MAX: Still good.
L: Are you scared yet?
MAX: You know, you're very annoying in a movie.
L: I know. I think it's very important that you know my faults as well as my many attributes.
MAX: Very thoughtful of you.
L: It is, isn't it?
MAX: Because as you know, you can get very carried away by your many attributes, suddenly find yourself thinking, my god, this women is absolutely perfect.
L: We wouldn't want that now, would we?
MAX: No, we wouldn't. (They kiss)
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Emily, Richard, and Rory are at the table, getting ready to eat pizza)
R: You wanna eat it before it gets cold. (Rory watches Emily take a bite) How is it?
EMILY: Not cold!
RICHARD: Mmmm. It's quite tasty. Emily, we should have this more often.
EMILY: What?
RICHARD: Perhaps instead of that horrible salmon that keeps showing up.
EMILY: That salmon is a fine delicacy.
RICHARD: Mm, potato, po-tah-to.
R: Try it again Grandma, it's probably cooler now.
EMILY: No, thank you, I'm fine.
R: You know what? It's really good if you add some extra Parmesan on it. (Rory grates Parmesan cheese on Emily's pizza) This is mom's special trick. Frozen pizza is a staple at our house. Mom's become a major doctoring genius. She'll put anything on it. One time Sookie came and brought us some foie gras, and mom stuck it on a pizza.
EMILY: How was it?
R: Pretty good once we took the foie gras off. Okay, that's good. Try it. Please. If you wanna get really crazy you can pick it up.
EMILY: Well, all right. Here goes nothing. (takes a bite) Mmm! That's wonderful!
R: See?
EMILY: Rory pass me that cheese. (Emily walks over to Richard and starts grating cheese on his pizza) Trust me, it makes all the difference.
R: I'll be right back. (Rory goes upstairs and gets a photo album out of the bedroom. She brings it back to the table.) I found this in mom's room.
EMILY: What's that?
R: Pictures.
EMILY: Oh my goodness, I haven't seen that in years.
RICHARD: Oh my gosh.
EMILY: Ah. Look at this
R: That's one fluffy white dress.
EMILY: Yes. There were 12 petticoats underneath it. We got it in London, remember Richard?
RICHARD: Uh yeah.
R: She looks like a little princess
EMILY: Yes, well, if memory serves about two minutes after that picture was taken her highness dumped a glass of grape juice all over it.
RICHARD: Look Emily, it's Hopey.
R: Hopey?
EMILY: My younger sister.
R: Has she ever been here when I was here? I don't remember her.
RICHARD: Oh, she lives in Paris. Our great ex patriot.
EMILY: Oh my Hopey, look at you. I haven't seen her in such a long time.
RICHARD: Maybe we should take a trip this year.
EMILY: That would be nice.
RICHARD: Maybe Rory could go with us.
R: I'll start packing tomorrow. Oh is that you guys?
RICHARD: Yes it is.
EMILY: That is our wedding picture.
R: It's an amazing dress.
EMILY: It should've been. My mother had three seamstresses working around the clock making it.
R: Do you still have it?
EMILY: Its upstairs packed away somewhere. I'll save it for you if you like.
RICHARD: Oh Emily, Rory's too young to be thinking about things like that.
EMILY: Oh, Richard, please. Every young girl thinks about her wedding. I know I did. I knew from the time I was twelve that I wanted lilies and orchids with a silver bow wrapped around them for my bouquet.
RICHARD: You also knew that you wanted to marry Errol Flynn.
R: Really? Grandma had a thing for the pirate guy?
EMILY: I did not have a thing for the pirate guy.
RICHARD: She was mad about him. She even tried to get me to grow one of those little mustaches.
R: You're kidding.
EMILY: Richard stop.
RICHARD: She wanted me to swing from a chandelier.
EMILY: Now you're just being silly.
RICHARD: Luckily I was on the fencing team in college or I would've married Lucinda Lester by now.
EMILY: Actually Lucinda Lester looked a lot like Errol Flynn. I should've married her; it would've been very modern of me.
R: Wow. Mom looks really beautiful here.
EMILY: Yes she does.
R: What was the occasion?
RICHARD: Who would like some coffee?
EMILY: That was her debutante gown for her coming out party.
R: Mom had a coming out party?
RICHARD: No she didn't.
RORY: Oh.
EMILY: Yes, well, things happen don't they?
RICHARD: Excuse me, I have some business calls to make.
EMILY: I'll go get that coffee.
(Emily and Richard both leave the table. Rory sits down and starts looking at the photo album.)
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
(From his diner, Luke watches the reenactors standing in the snow. He brings out a tray of drinks.)
LUKE: Here.
HARRY: What is this?
LUKE: I brought you coffee.
HARRY: No, thank you.
LUKE: Harry, you're freezing. Take the damn coffee.
HARRY: When our forefathers stood out here many moons ago, they didn't have any coffee.
LUKE: How do you know? Do you have written documentation of about what sort of beverages they did or did not have on that long historic night of standing?
HARRY: This is still a joke to you young man. I don't choose to be a joke. We don't need your coffee.
LUKE: Harry, please, take the coffee. My father would've taken the coffee.
HARRY: Well, all right then, thank you.
LUKE: Andrew?
ANDREW: Thank you Luke.
LUKE: Kirk?
Kirk: You got any herbal tea?
LUKE: Not on me, but I can get some.
KIRK: With a squeeze of lemon?
LUKE: Okay.
GUY 1: I could really go for some cocoa.
GUY 2: Oh that sounds good. Cocoa for me too.
LUKE: Okay, okay, hang on a minute. One herbal tea, and two cocoas.
(Luke hears Max and Lorelai across the street. He watches them.)
MAX: Yeah that part was a little slow.
LORELAI: Slow?
MAX: But it picked up after that, don't you think?
(Luke watches with a sad look as Max and Lorelai kiss.)
CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT PORCH
(Max and Lorelai walk up the steps to the porch)
L: So this is it, my house.
MAX: Its nice
L: Thank you.
MAX: Good porch. Nice windows. Front door. Which opens I assume.
L: Yeah.
MAX: Something wrong?
L: No, nothings wrong.
MAX: Are you sure?
L: Uh, yeah. See, I was so excited about the snow and about seeing you.
MAX: Thank you.
L: You're welcome. That I didn't really think this thing out and I usually think this kind of thing out, so I'm just thinking this thing out.
MAX: What thing?
L: Inviting a man over to my house.
MAX: Okay.
L: See I have really strict rules about dating. I keep my personal life totally separate from my life with Rory. You know, I never want her to feel unsettled or like her life could just shift at any moment.
MAX: I totally understand.
L: And she comes first, and this is her house too and . . .
MAX: I understand. This is something that you don't do often.
L: Ever.
MAX: Ever?
L: Never.
MAX: I see.
L: I mean, I've dated, and you know, dated, but I've just never dated, here in our house.
MAX: What if I promised you that if you let me in, all I'm expecting is a cup of coffee. That's it. Nothing weird or funny. Unless of course you're into weird and funny . .
L: Max!
MAX: 'Cause I can do weird and funny. Lorelai, I've been enjoying the hell out of myself tonight and I think you are too.
L: I am.
MAX: Well, so it's snowing, cold, and your daughter is elsewhere.
L: I know. I know
MAX: I mean this whole night has been a weird chismin of events.
L: Oh it's that fate guy again.
MAX: At some point in your life you're gonna have to decide that some guy is worth opening that door for. I am just volunteering.
(Lorelai opens the door and starts to walk in. She turns around.)
LORELAI: Would you like some coffee?
(Max walks inside)
CUT TO LORELAIS KITCHEN
(Lorelai takes some coffee out of the refrigerator and walks over to the coffee maker. She starts making the coffee while Max stands next to her.)
L: How strong do you like your coffee because I've built up such a tolerance to it I usually make it too intense for most people.
MAX: Yeah, yeah, I've lived through the fiesta burger, don't hold back now.
L: Okay.
MAX: Can I help?
L: Um, yeah, you can fill up the pot.
MAX: Oh, I'm very good at that. Six cups sounds good?
L: Fine, what are you gonna have?
MAX: You do know that was a leading question right?
L: Really how so? (They kiss) How badly do you want that coffee?
MAX: Not that badly.
L: Such a good answer.
(They begin kissing and continue to kiss as they walk from the kitchen to the bottom of the steps. Lane walks out of Rory's room and finds Max and Lorelai kissing on the bottom step. Max sees Lane and stops kissing.)
MAX: How many kids did you say you have?
L: One. Why? (turns around) Lane! Hi, hi. We're just, uh, what are you doing here?
LANE: I'm sorry. I was waiting for Rory. I'll just go back into her room and I won't come back out, I promise.
(Lane runs into Rory's room and puts on loud music.)
L: Oh, that's the Cure. I have to go back in there.
MAX: Its okay, Ill finish up the coffee.
L: I'll be back as fast as humanly possible.
MAX: Good.
CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM
(Lane is lying on the bed in the dark. Lorelai opens the door, turns on the light, and turns off the music.)
L: Hey.
LANE: Sorry I messed up your date.
L: Ah you didn't mess up your date. What's going on?
LANE: I was waiting for Rory to get home.
L: Sweetie, Rory's stuck in Hartford tonight.
LANE: Oh I didn't know. Ill just go
L: Hey, do you wanna talk? I'm not Rory, but we do use the same blow dryer.
LANE: I did something really stupid today
L: Okay, what'd you pierce? (Lorelai sits on the bed)
LANE: Nothing. I touched a boy's hair.
L: Okay.
LANE: A boy I really like.
L: So far missing the stupid part.
LANE: I kind of did it without his permission.
L: Now we're getting somewhere.
LANE: I don't know what happened. I mean, I was just standing there and then he bends over and his hair falls forward and suddenly its like my hand had a life of its own.
L: Sounds like your hand had a little help from your hormones
LANE: God I'm so humiliated. I can't ever go back to school. I'll have to be home schooled. My mother finally gets her way.
L: Look at it from a different perspective. You have so many years of screw-ups ahead of you. View this as a trial run for really grownup humiliation.
LANE: So not helping.
L: Maybe you should be a hairdresser.
LANE: Lorelai!
L: Yes its perfect. Then you can run your hands though anybody's hair you want and they'll pay you for it.
LANE: What am I going to do? Everyone at school's gonna be talking about me. I can't show my face.
L: Everyone does stupid things in high school, it's like a requirement.
LANE: Not like this.
L: No, some people get pregnant. Talk about something really juicy for the gossip mill.
LANE: I forgot about that
L: Yeah, everybody screws up Lane. That's what happens. It's what you do with the screw-ups, it's how you handle the experience, that's what you should judge yourself by. I have a great life and an amazing kid. And I took a detour, I ended up some place good.
LANE: Yeah.
L: Tell me this. How did his hair feel? As good as it looked?
LANE: Better.
L: Oh, you're gonna be fine. I'm positive about that.
LANE: Thank you.
L: You're welcome.
LANE: So who's the guy?
L: Rory's teacher.
LANE: Oh, he has nice hair.
L: Yeah.
CUT TO LORELAI"S LIVING ROOM
(Max is waiting on the couch. Lorelai walks over and sits next to him.)
L: Hey.
MAX: Hey. Everything okay in there?
L: It will be.
MAX: So where did we leave off?
L: Oh, Lane is gonna stay here tonight. She had a really bad teen day and needs to crash someplace sympathetic.
MAX: Okay, I understand.
L: I swear to God, if this wasn't a major Judy Blume moment, I'd kick her cute little butt right out of here.
MAX: Can you recommend a hotel that really really close to here?
L: Why don't you just stay here tonight? Everybody else is.
MAX: Oh, I don't know.
L: Really, the couch is comfortable, there's pillows and blankets, and the bathroom's through there. The kitchen has nothing in it but running water if you get thirsty and. . . . it's an awful night.
MAX: Okay, if it's not a problem.
L: Not at all.
MAX: Can I at least give you a kiss goodnight?
L: Only if you intend to live till morning. (They kiss)
MAX: Goodnight.
L: Goodnight.
(Lorelai stands up, runs her fingers through Max's hair, and then goes upstairs.)
CUT TO OUTSIDE sh*t OF LORELAI'S HOUSE
CUT TO LORELAI'S BEDROOM
(The next morning, Lorelai is in bed. She's hears a car outside, and looks out the window to see Rory being dropped off. She puts on shoes and grabs a coat, and greets Rory at the door.)
CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT PORCH
L: Hi.
R: Hi. What's up?
L: Nothing, what's up with you?
R: You have something to tell me.
L: Boy you're so smart. Right, okay, here we go. I've got a boy in the house.
R: You what?
L: Nothing happened, I swear, he slept the whole night on the couch. And you know him.
R: I do?
L: And you like him. I don't know if that's relevant, I just thought that I would throw that in there.
CUT TO LIVING ROOM
(Rory and Lorelai are standing next to the couch on which Max is sleeping)
R: Its Mr. Medina.
L: I know.
R: My English teacher is on my couch.
L: It was the snow. You know how I get, its like catnip. I was walking, he was there, his car was broken, we had fiesta burgers. It was the snow. . . .Rory, say something. (Rory walks into the kitchen. Lorelai follows her)
CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN
L: Rory talk to me, how do you feel?
R: I don't know.
L: Take a guess. Angry, frustrated, nauseous?
R: Weird. I feel weird. Has he been here all night?
L: Pretty much.
R: Oh my God. Did he go into the bathroom? I have stuff hanging in there!
L: Honey, you knew I was gonna date him, right? This isn't a total surprise.
R: Yes I knew you were gonna date. I just didn't expect him to be here . . at our house . . .in the morning.
L: I know.
R: I don't remember ever there being a man in our house.
L: Yeah, well I kind of broke the rules.
R: God, why is this so weird for me?
L: Because I should've told you first.
R: No.
L: Because I should have talked to you before I did this.
R: No.
L: Because you're afraid he smushed the couch pillows out of shape?
R: Do you love him?
L: I. .We had one date. It was a great date. World Series level. But it was just a date. Honey, I promised myself a long time ago that I was gonna keep all this stuff separate from you and I want you to know that that still stands. Okay, this was a one-time thing. I'm not gonna start just bringing guys home. This is not a trend.
R: You can you know.
L: What?
R: Bring guys home. I mean, if you like someone you should feel comfortable doing that.
L: I appreciate that.
R: I want you to be happy.
L: And I love you for that.
R: Plus I know you're not a cat person so you truly will be alone if you don't find someone.
L: Okay, look, someday I will bring someone home but when I do I just wanna be sure it's THE guy.
R: Mr. Medina's not THE guy?
L: I don't know, he might be. But right now it's just you and me. (Lane comes out of Rory's room) And sometimes Lane.
LANE: Hey
R: Hey
L: I'm gonna go wake the man up. (Lorelai walks out of the kitchen)
LANE: Your mom let me spend the night here.
R: I tried calling you back all night but the phones didn't turn back on until this morning.
LANE: Its okay, I understand.
R: Lane I'm so sorry, I've been the worst friend lately.
LANE: No, I just wigged out a little. I get jealous sometimes. I mean, you seem to have this really great life and I don't really fit in there.
R: That's not true, you totally fit in.
LANE: Yeah?
R: I'm talking Legos.
LANE: I hope so.
R: I will be better from now on, I promise. Twenty-four hours a day at your disposal.
LANE: Dean'll love that.
R: Well, he'll have to, you came first.
LANE: That's right. I got dibs. (They hug) Okay, I have to go home.
R: Coffee at Luke's, 2 o'clock?
LANE: You're on.
R: And I wanna hear all about that hair touching incident.
LANE: Yeah and I wanna hear the rest of the teacher on the couch incident.
R: Deal
(Rory starts to walk into the living room but stops when she sees Lorelai and Max talking and laughing. She walks back into the kitchen and pulls out the strip of photos of her mom and dad and looks at them.)

1.09 - Rory's Dance
written by Amy Sherman-Palladino
directed by Lesli Linka Glatter
(Emily, Rory, and Lorelai are having dinner.)
EMILY: Your grandfather called last night and told me to let you know he's bringing you back something very special from Prague.
RORY: Wow, Prague. How amazing is it that he's going to Prague?
EMILY: It's supposed to be lovely, very dramatic castles everywhere.
RORY: Did you know the cell that Václav Havel was held in is now a hostel? You can stay there for like $50 a night.
(Rory turns to Lorelai, who is playing with her food.)
RORY: Hey, maybe on our big trip to Europe we could go to Prague and stay in his cell.
LORELAI: Absolutely. And then we can go to Turkey and stay in that place from Midnight Express.
EMILY: Lorelai, what are you doing?
LORELAI: Getting rid of the avacado.
EMILY: Since when do you not like avacado?
LORELAI: Since the day I said, "Gross. What is this?" and you said, "Avacado."
EMILY: (to Rory) I'm focusing on you now. Tell me all about the Chilton formal next week.
LORELAI: There's a formal?
RORY: How do you know about the formal?
LORELAI: Yeah, how do you know about the formal?
EMILY: I read my Chilton newsletter.
LORELAI: Since when do you get a Chilton newsletter?
EMILY: Well as a major contributor to Rory's education I figured I had the right to ask for a newsletter to be sent to my house.
(Emily goes to get her copy of the newsletter.)
LORELAI: Are you serious?
EMILY: And it's a good thing, too, since you don't bother to read yours. One of us should be up to date on the goings-on at Rory's school.
LORELAI: Hey, Mom, I read my newsletter.
EMILY: You did?
LORELAI: That's right.
EMILY: What was the picture on the cover?
LORELAI: (uncertainly) It was a picture of a really rich kid in plaid.
EMILY: (shows Lorelai the cover) It was a spotted owl.
LORELAI: In plaid.
(Rory holds back laughter.)
EMILY: The owls are endangered and Chilton is taking donations to help them. (to Rory) You gave a very nice one, in case you're interested.
LORELAI: Mom, don't be giving donations on Rory's behalf. I'll do that.
EMILY: How can you do that when you don't bother to read the newsletter?
LORELAI: I read the newsletter.
EMILY: You didn't know they were taking donations.
LORELAI: It's a private school. They're always taking donations. They teach a class in it. I'll get them next time.
EMILY: Well what about the owls?
LORELAI: They'll live.
EMILY: Well apparently they won't, dear. That's why they need the donations in the first place.
LORELAI: (to Rory) So, you have a formal coming up?
RORY: Yeah, but I don't think I'm going to go.
EMILY: Nonsense. Of course you're going.
LORELAI: Mom, if Rory doesn't want to go she doesn't have to go.
EMILY: Well I don't understand why she wouldn't want to go.
LORELAI: I know you don't.
RORY: I'm gonna go get another Coke.
EMILY: What did you say to her?
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
EMILY: If she doesn't want to go it must be because of something you said.
LORELAI: Mom, I promise. All I ever said to her about dances is that you go, you dance, you have punch, you eat, you take a picture, and then you get auctioned off to a biker gang from Sausalito.
EMILY: Lorelai, this is serious.
LORELAI: Mom, I said nothing, OK? Rory's disdain of formals is totally her own. Let's just drop it, please.
EMILY: Fine.
LORELAI: Fine.
(They both go back to their food.)
EMILY: What's wrong with the tomato?
LORELAI: It was fraternizing with the enemy.
(Cut to the interior of a car. Lorelai and Rory are driving home.)
LORELAI: Why didn't you mention the dance?
RORY: 'Cause I'm not going.
LORELAI: Oh. But why aren't you going?
RORY: 'Cause I hate dances.
LORELAI: Good answer. Except you've never actually been to a dance.
RORY: So?
LORELAI: So you really have nothing to compare it to.
RORY: No, but I can imagine it.
LORELAI: That's true. However, not really, since you've never actually been to one you're basing all your dance opinions on one midnight viewing of Sixteen Candles.
RORY: So?
LORELAI: So you should have a decent reason for hating something before you really decide you hate it.
RORY: Trust me, I'll hate it. It'll be stuffy and boring, the music will suck and since none of the kids at school like me, I'll be stuck in the back listening to 98° watching Tristin and Paris argue over which one of them gets to make me miserable first.
LORELAI: OK. Or it'll be all sparkly and exciting and you'll be standing on the dance floor listening to Tom Waits with some great-looking guy staring at you so hard that you don't even realize that Paris and Tristin have just been eaten by bears.
RORY: What guy?
LORELAI: I don't know -- maybe the guy who hangs out in our trees all day waiting for you to come home?
RORY: Dean does not hang out in trees.
LORELAI: He bashed his head on a branch last week when I came out of the house too quickly.
RORY: Why do you care all of sudden if I go?
LORELAI: I don't care if you go. I just don't want you to miss any experience because you're too afraid.
RORY: I'm afraid? Of what?
LORELAI: Of asking Dean. Of him saying 'no.' Of going to a dance with a bunch of kids who haven't accepted you yet. Of dancing in public. Of finding out you should never be dancing in public.
RORY: OK, OK, I get it.
LORELAI: Listen, I know you are not Miss Party Girl, and I love you for that, but sometimes I wonder -- do you not join in because you really don't want to or because you're too shy? If the reason you don't want to go is because you really don't want to go and not because you are in any way afraid, then this is the last time I'll mention it, I promise.
RORY: (uncertainly) I don't have a dress.
LORELAI: I could make you one.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Oh yeah. We could get some great shoes and some new earrings. You could get your hair done.
RORY: You won't think I'm an idiot?
LORELAI: Depends on what hairstyle you choose. This dance could be great for you.
(Cut to Lane and Rory walking in the snow.)
RORY: He's gonna say no.
LANE: Why would he say no.
RORY: Why would he say yes?
LANE: Rory, listen to me. There's absolutely no point in having a boyfriend if you can't get him to go to the dance with you.
RORY: He's not my boyfriend.
LANE: Really?
RORY: No.
LANE: What is he then?
RORY: He's my...gentleman caller.
LANE: OK, Blanche.
RORY: I don't know what he is. But he's not my boyfriend. Do you think he's my boyfriend.
LANE: I think you guys spend a lot of time not kissing other people if this isn't a girlfriend/boyfriend thing.
RORY: Girlfriend.
LANE: You.
RORY: Boyfriend.
LANE: Him.
RORY: No. It sounds weird.
LANE: Look, have you had the talk yet?
RORY: Yes, Lane, babies come from the stork.
LANE: The other talk.
RORY: What other other talk?
LANE: "We've been dating a few weeks no. Where do we stand? What are we to each other? If another girls asks you out, do you feel free to go?"
RORY: How is it that you know so much about this?
LANE: Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.
(They look in the window of the market and see Dean with a customer.)
LANE: There he is.
RORY: I should do this later.
(Rory starts to leave. Lane stops her.)
LANE: No. No, you have to do this now.
RORY: Why?
LANE: Because I have to go home soon and my mom threw out our TV when she caught me watching V.I.P. So I'm bored and I need some entertainment.
RORY: (takes a deep breath) OK. Here I go.
LANE: Good luck! Oh, and Rory, remember to enunciate. I'm reading lips out here.
(Rory goes into the market, leaving Lane with her face plastered to the window. Rory walks up to Dean.)
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: Oh, hey.
RORY: You're busy.
DEAN: Yeah. I just have to put the new green bean shipment on the shelves. You want to help?
RORY: Yeah, sure. I, uh, I love stocking beans.
DEAN: OK. Uh, follow me.
RORY: So do you work on Saturdays? I forget.
DEAN: Well it depends. Sometimes I come in if I don't have any plans. Why?
RORY: No reason. See, there's this thing at my school on Saturday. Well it's not really at my school, it's kind of given by my school .
DEAN: What is it?
RORY: Well it's this thing where you go and they play music and you're supposed to get all dressed up and do some kind of dance and then there's chicken.
DEAN: Chicken?
RORY: Well I don't know if there's chicken. But at these kinds of things they often serve chicken because it's probably cheaper and people eat it, so the logic behind the chicken choice really isn't that bad.
DEAN: I'm lost
RORY: It's a dance.
DEAN: Ah.
RORY: And it's not like I'm dying to go or anything, but it is a new school and being a part of the social activities is really important at Chilton.
DEAN: So are you asking me to go to the dance with you?
RORY: No. Yes. I mean, if you wanted to go, I would go too.
DEAN: Well that would probably be good since it's your school.
RORY: Right. So do you want to go?
DEAN: Honestly?
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: I've actually never gone to a dance before.
RORY: Because they're lame?
DEAN: Yeah. And it's just not the way I ever wanted to spend my time. I mean, I'm not a big joiner.
RORY: OK, fair enough. More beans please.
(They stack beans in silence.)
DEAN: You want to go, don't you?
RORY: No. I don't. I have no desire to go at all. I was just thinking out loud, that's all.
DEAN: So, uh, what would I have to wear?
RORY: What?
DEAN: To this dance. What would I have to wear?
RORY: Anything you want.
DEAN: Come on.
RORY: No, really whatever you're comfortable in is fine.
DEAN: Rory...
RORY: Some sort of pants would be nice.
DEAN: Rory...
RORY: It's coat and tie.
DEAN: Oh man.
RORY: But you could probably get away with a coat and no tie.
DEAN: OK
RORY: Really?
DEAN: Yeah.
(Rory kisses Dean.)
RORY: Thank you.
DEAN: You're welcome.
(Rory goes back outside where Lane is waiting.)
(Cut to Lorelai making a dress on a dressmaker's dummy. While she's bending down, she falls over, bringing the dummy down on top of her.)
LORELAI: Aaaah!
(The doorbell rings.)
LORELAI: Ow.
(Lorelai gets up and goes to answer the door.)
SOOKIE: Extra thread.
LORELAI: Oh, God bless. I've been working so hard to finish Rory's dress I haven't been to get out.
SOOKIE: Jeez, you are walking funny.
LORELAI: I know. Rory's dress made a pass at me and I think I pulled something getting up.
SOOKIE: Here, sit, sit sit. Hey, you know what, I've got an Ace bandage in my bag. I'm not sure how we can wrap it but maybe we can do something kind of creative and --
LORELAI: Sookie. Ow
SOOKIE: Let's see.
(Sookie pulls bottles of pills out of her purse.)
LORELAI: Wow!
SOOKIE: OK, I've got Percodan, Vicodin, Darvocet, and, uh...Take this one. It's a muscle relaxer. Very mild, I promise.
LORELAI: Thanks. Maybe later.
SOOKIE: OK. I've got to go. You sure you're going to be OK?
LORELAI: I'm sure.
SOOKIE: OK.
LORELAI: Bye.
SOOKIE: Bye.
(The phone rings.)
LORELAI: Yeah.
EMILY: You sound terrible.
LORELAI: I'm fine, Mom, I just stubbed my toe.
EMILY: Maybe you should get rid of some of that clutter in your living room.
LORELAI: Maybe
EMILY: That room is a hazard.
LORELAI: Ah, you know, I've seen the light. Everything goes. What else have you got?
EMILY: I want to talk about Rory's dance. It's just k*ll me that she's not going.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
EMILY: It may seem frivolous and silly to her now but belive me, these are the kind of experiences you regret missing later.
LORELAI: OK.
EMILY: And regret can make you bitter. Do you want Rory to be bitter?
LORELAI: Well, sort of.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: What, Mom? She can make some cash off of it. Become a crazy Oscar Levant kind of celebrity, go on talk shows, heckle Regis.
EMILY: I wish you would take this seriously.
LORELAI: Mom, Rory is going to the dance.
EMILY: She is?
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
EMILY: Oh, that's wonderful. I'm thrilled.
LORELAI: I'm making her dress right now.
EMILY: You're making her dress?
LORELAI: Yep.
EMILY: But why?
LORELAI: Well, so she'll look really ugly and people will point and throw rocks.
EMILY: Why don't you let me buy her a dress?
LORELAI: Mom, you were thrilled five seconds ago, remember?
EMILY: You're not using the curtains are you?
LORELAI: Mom, I gotta go.
EMILY: Just one more thing. Take a picture of Rory for me, will you please?
LORELAI: I will.
EMILY: On the stairs. And one by the front door. And one as she's getting ready, you know, putting her hair up, putting her makeup on?
LORELAI: OK, do you want one when she's shaving her legs? You know, one leg up in the tub, waving the disposable razor in the air?
EMILY: This is a once in a lifetime event. You get to be there and I don't.
(Lorelai lies down on the floor, trying to get comfortable.)
LORELAI: Oh, boy.
EMILY: I figure if I got enough pictures I could at least line them up in chronological order and pretend I was there.
LORELAI: Mom.
EMILY: Maybe bind them together, make a flipbook out of them.
LORELAI: Mom, would you like to come over on Saturday and see Rory go to the dance?
EMILY: Why, what a nice idea, I'd love that, thank you. I'll see you at 7.
(Emily hangs up the phone. Lorelai sighs.)
(Tristin walks up to the table where Paris is selling tickets to the Chilton Winter Formal.)
PARIS: Hi, Tristin.
TRISTIN: Paris.
PARIS: Two, I assume.
TRISTIN: You assume right.
PARIS: So, who are you taking?
TRISTIN: Why, are you free?
PARIS: I'm, uh...
TRISTIN: Nah, what am I thinking? You wouldn't be free this close to the dance.
(He hands her some money and she hands him the tickets.)
PARIS: Here's your change.
TRISTIN: Hey, is your hair shorter?
PARIS: Yeah, a quarter of an inch.
TRISTIN: Really.
PARIS: I got it trimmed.
TRISTIN: Looks good.
PARIS: Thanks.
(Tristin walks down the hall to where Rory is reading while waiting in line to buy tickets.)
TRISTIN: And she's reading again. How novel.
RORY: Good-bye, Tristin.
TRISTIN: Did you get the novel thing? Because...
RORY: I said good-bye.
TRISTIN: What are you doing here?
RORY: I like lines.
TRISTIN: The guy's supposed to buy the tickets.
RORY: Really. Does Susan Faludi know about this?
TRISTIN: Unless of course there is no guy.
RORY: There's a guy.
TRISTIN: A cheap guy.
RORY: Well, what can I say? I like 'em cheap. Sloppy too -- bald spot, beer gut, you know, and the pants that kind of slip down in the back, giving you that good plumber sh*t. That sends me through the roof.
TRISTIN: So who is he?
RORY: How many languages can you say 'none of your business' in.
TRISTIN: Does he go to this school?
RORY: No, he doesn't.
TRISTIN: Uh-huh. Well, look, OK, I'll confess something to you. I don't have a date.
RORY: Well I hear Squeaky Fromme is up for parole soon. You should keep a good thought.
TRISTIN: Well I actually thought you'd like to go with me.
RORY: You did not.
TRISTIN: I did too.
RORY: You did not because you are not stupid.
TRISTIN: Why thank you.
RORY: Slimy and weasely, yes, but stupid, no. You'd have to be stupid to think that, given our history, I would ever, barring a piano or a safe falling on my head, want to go anywhere with you, ever.
TRISTIN: OK, fine. I'll take Cissy.
RORY: I'll send her a condolence card.
TRISTIN: Yeah. Well at least she won't be buying her own ticket.
(Tristin walks down the hall. Rory is next in line.)
RORY: Two, please.
PARIS: Idiot.
RORY: Excuse me?
PARIS: He was totally nice to you and you couldn't be a bigger jerk.
RORY: You like Tristin so much, you go out with him.
PARIS: I don't have enough change.
RORY: Pay me later.
PARIS: What am I, your Versateller? Wait for change. (yells at the boy sitting next to her) I need change! Now! (to Rory) There's no way you're going with someone better than Tristin.
RORY: Whatever.
PARIS: You probably don't even have a date. You're probably going to come down with some very rare form of flu that only hits losers on dance night.
RORY: You know what? I don't want my change. Money makes people shallow.
(Rory walks away from Paris.)
PARIS: I've got your change. Hey! Hey! If you think I'm keepig this dollar, I'm not!
BOY: I'll take it.
PARIS: Shut up!
(Saturday night. Lorelai is sitting on the couch reading a magazine.)
LORELAI: (calls to Rory) Come on already!
RORY: (from her room) I'm primping.
LORELAI: You're 16. You have skin like a baby's ass. There's nothing to primp.
RORY: OK, OK, here I come.
(Rory comes into the room wearing her dress for the dance.)
LORELAI: Wow. Someone hit you with a pretty stick.
RORY: This dress is amazing. You outdid yourself.
LORELAI: It's beautiful, babe, you look beautiful. Come here.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Stray hair.
RORY: Fix, please.
LORELAI: Yes. Hm. I think my favorite part is the shoes.
RORY: The heels hurt.
LORELAI: Well, beauty is pain
RORY: I'll just throw them on on my way out
LORELAI: No, you should put them on now and let your feet get really numb.
RORY: That's sick.
LORELAI: Go get me the hair spray.
RORY: OK.
(Rory runs to get her shoes. The doorbell rings.)
LORELAI: It's open!
SOOKIE: It's me! I got tacos!
LORELAI: Yay!
SOOKIE: I got extra hot sauce and a couple of extra burritos to put in the fridge in case you get hungry later.
LORELAI: You take such good care of me.
RORY: Hey, Sookie. Look.
SOOKIE: (gasps) Oh my God! You're a movie star! I'm serious. Oh my -- At some point tonight, walk down a flight of stairs. Movie stars always walk down staircases.
LORELAI: OK, come on, let me spray while you try to figure out what she just said.
SOOKIE: You, don't move. I got it.
(Sookie points the bottle in the wrong direction and ends up spraying her eyes instead of Rory's hair.)
SOOKIE: Ow!
LORELAI: Sookie.
SOOKIE: Wrong way! I got it.
RORY: Are you OK?
SOOKIE: Yeah, sweetie, hand that to your mother, and my eyelashes are all stuck together.
(Sookie stag
LORELAI: Honey, are you sure you're alright?
SOOKIE: I'm fine.
LORELAI: (to Rory) Shield the tacos. OK, ready?
(Rory puts the tacos under the table and covers her eyes. Lorelai sprays her hair.)
RORY: God!
LORELAI: OK, that will be good for six slow dances, four medium ones, one lambada, but if you plan on doing any moshing I suggest another coat.
RORY: I think I'm good.
SOOKIE: Rory, sweetie, is this soap by the sink in the silver bottle?
RORY: No!
LORELAI: Go in there, quick.
(The doorbell rings.)
LORELAI: We're in here!
EMILY: We're in here? That's how you answer the door?
LORELAI: Well I was all out of Saran Wrap.
EMILY: I don't even want to figure that one out. I just want to see my granddaughter. Where is she?
LORELAI: Kitchen.
EMILY: Oh, perfect. I want to be all ready for the big entrance. How's the light in here? Never mind. I'll just take one with the flash and one without to make sure we got it right.
LORELAI: Wow, Mom, look at you. You'd think Anne Taylor was having a sale or something.
(Emily, armed with a camera, gets into position.)
EMILY: OK, Rory, come in here please.
(Rory comes into the living room wearing a kitchen towel as a bib and eating a taco.)
RORY: Hey, Grandma
EMILY: (to Lorelai) She has lived with you too long.
LORELAI: Honey, lose the bib and the taco, put your shoes on, come back out, and let Grandma take the pretty picture.
RORY: OK.
(Sookie comes in.)
SOOKIE: I'm gonna get going.
LOREAI: You are not driving.
SOOKIE: I walked. (to the staircase) It was nice to see you again, Mrs. Gilmore, or at least make out your shape.
LORELAI: Call in fifteen minutes or I'm sending out a search party.
SOOKIE: (to the wall) And you call me if I can come over and help you up the stairs or something.
LORELAI: No, I'll be fine.
SOOKIE: Bye.
EMILY: Why would you need help up the stairs?
LORELAI: No reason. Rory, let's go, your public awaits!
EMILY: Why aren't you moving?
LORELAI: I'm comfortable, that's all.
EMILY: Are you hurt?
LORELAI: I have a little back spasm, that's it. It's no big deal.
EMILY: What sort of back spasm?
LORELAI: I don't know, Mom, just a normal one.
EMILY: There is nothing normal about a back spasm. The very fact that it has the word spasm in it means it's not normal.
LORELAI: Alright, here she is, Mom, get your camera moving.
EMILY: What? Oh, my, you're gorgeous. Oh! Smile!
(Emily takes several pictures of Rory.)
EMILY: I'm so glad you decided to buy her a dress.
(Lorelai and Rory exchange a look. A car horn sounds outside.)
RORY: That's Dean!
LORELAI: Hey, come here. Have an amazing time.
(Rory kisses Lorelai and Emily and then Rory runs for the door.)
RORY: I'll chronicle the whole evening for you, I promise. Bye, Grandma.
EMILY: Where are you going?
RORY: To the dance.
EMILY: You do not go running out the door when a boy honks.
LORELAI: Mom, it's fine.
EMILY: It certainly is not fine. This is not a drive through. She's not fried chicken.
RORY: But I told him to honk and I'd meet him out there. We agreed.
EMILY: I don't care what you told him. If he wants to take you out, he will walk up to this door, and know, and say 'good evening,' and come inside for a moment like any civilized human being would know to do.
LORELAI: Now, Mom, this is silly, I have met him already.
EMILY: Well I haven't.
LORELAI: Yeah, but--
EMILY: We will wait until he comes to the door.
RORY: He doesn't know he's supposed to.
EMILY: He will figure it out.
(Rory sighs and crosses her arms. They wait in silence. A minute or so later, Dean honks again.)
EMILY: He's not a very bright boy, is he?
LORELAI: Mom, please.
(The doorbell rings. Rory starts to run to the door.)
EMILY: Don't rush. A lady never rushes.
(Rory runs to the door anyway.)
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: Hey, uh, I thought I was supposed to honk.
RORY: I know, I'm sorry.
EMILY: Young man, come in here please.
LORELAI: Hey, Dean, meet my mother, Emily Post.
EMILY: Emily Gilmore
DEAN: Hi.
EMILY: Hello.
LORELAI: Great rap session. Alright, you guys are out of here. Have fun.
EMILY: Be home by eleven
(Lorelai mouths 'twelve.')
RORY: Bye Mom, by Grandma.
(Rory and Dean leave.)
EMILY: What do you know about this boy?
LORELAI: I know that Rory likes him and that his parole officer has high hopes for his rehabilitation.
EMILY: Does he drink?
LORELAI: Like a fish.
EMILY: That's not a crazy question.
LORELAI: It is a crazy question, Mom, because if I had knowledge of him being a drinker, he would not be with Rory now.
EMILY: Yes, but--
LORELAI: Mom, please relax. Dean is a good kid. Rory's gonna have a great time. You got your pictures and tomorrow I will call you and give you all the details.
EMILY: What are you going to do?
LORELAI: What do you mean?
EMILY: Well you certainly can't be left alone.
LORELAI: Yes I can.
EMILY: You can barely move. You've been sitting on that couch since I got here.
LORELAI: That's because this is a right comfy couch.
EMILY: Maybe I should stay.
LORELAI: No, no, Mom, you really don't have to do that.
EMILY: I'm not leaving my daughter stranded on the couch. What if you need to get to the bathroom?
LORELAI: I don't go anymore, Mom. I gave it up cold turkey.
EMILY: I'm staying.
LORELAI: No, Mom...Look -- I can stand, OK?
(Lorelai, obviously in pain, stands slowly.)
LORELAI: See? I'm up. OK, see? I'm fine.
EMILY: Move.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Move. If you're fine, than move.
LORELAI: I can move. This is me moving. (nothing happens) Any second now the moving will begin. (nothing happens) Rats.
(Lorelai flops back on the couch.)
EMILY: I'll go start some tea. Please tell me you have something besides Lipton.
LORELAI: (muttering to herself) Oh, a stroke would be so good right about now.
(Cut to Rory and Dean. They are in the car on the way to the dance.)
RORY: Maybe we should just forget about this
DEAN: OK.
RORY: I mean, it's just a dance. What's the big deal?
DEAN: b*at me.
RORY: And these kids at my school -- awful. Have you seen The Outsiders?
DEAN: Yeah, I have.
RORY: Just call me Ponyboy. I heard this place is beautiful though -- old and historic.
DEAN: Huh.
RORY: Maybe we could just go in for a minute.
DEAN: Fine.
RORY: Or not.
DEAN: Fine too.
RORY: I don't know. Why can't I decide? This is stupid. What do you think?
DEAN: I think that you look amazing.
RORY: Maybe just a couple minutes won't hurt.
(Cut to Lorela and Emily. Emily is on the phone. Lorelai is still on the couch.)
EMILY: Yes, Marta. Just make sure everything's locked up before you leave. (pause) No, I won't be home tonight.
(Lorelai groans.)
EMILY: (to Lorelai) Was that a pain?
LORELAI: Yes. A big one.
EMILY: (to Marta) Alright. That's it. Bye.
LORELAI: So, Mom, you really, really don't have to do this.
EMILY: Don't be silly. I couldn't possibly leave you alone like this.
LORELAI: What are you doing, Mom?
EMILY: I'm trying to find the candlesticks I bought you.
LORELAI: What candlesticks?
EMILY: The Baccarat candlesticks I bought you last year for Christmas. I assumed you stuffed them in the back of the closet somewhere.
(Lorelai sits up and looks worried.)
LORELAI: Uh, well, no, I did not stuff them in the back of the closet.
EMILY: Well then where are they? I don't see them out.
LORELAI: (hesitantly) Well, see, we didn't actually have a...big use for the crystal candlesticks so I kind of...exchanged them.
EMILY: For what?
LORELAI: A monkey lamp.
EMILY: Pardon me?
LORELAI: It's a lamp with a bunch of monkeys on it.
EMILY: Baccarat candlesticks for a moneky lamp?
LORELAI: They're really, really happy monkeys, Mom.
EMILY: Where is this lamp? I want to see it.
LORELAI: It's right there on the desk.
(Emily walks over to the lamp and looks closely at it.)
EMILY: Oh my God! They're holding coconuts and leering!
LORELAI: It's funny.
EMILY: You traded my lovely gift for for a semi-pornographic leering monkey lamp? How could you?
(Lorelai shrugs.)
EMILY: This is not just about the bad breeding of returning a gift. This goes right to the heart of the question of taste. You were given something of substance and you cast it off for a ridiculous, slightly sinister barroom decoration. Explain this to me, Lorelai.
(As her mother rants, Lorelai's smile turns to a frown. She sinks lower on the couch and covers herself with a blanket.)
LORELAI: My back hurts.
(Cut to the Chilton dance. Rory and Dean are standing near the back of the room.)
RORY: Well it's a very good room.
DEAN: Looks historical.
RORY: I commend the person that suggested this very location.
DEAN: So, we could just get our picture taken and leave.
RORY: We could.
DEAN: Or we could dance a little first.
RORY: Yeah?
DEAN: I stress a little.
RORY: Something slow.
DEAN: That sounds good.
(Madeline and Louise are sitting at a table at the dance.)
LOUISE: Can we go yet?
MADELINE: We haven't even eaten dinner.
LOUISE: I'm bored.
MADELINE: We have to wait for Paris anyway.
LOUISE: Fine. Give me your roll.
MADELINE: Wow.
LOUISE: What?
MADELINE: Rory Gilmore. God, she's got good hair.
LOUISE: Who's the dish?
MADELINE: b*at me.
LOUISE: He's not of the manor born, that's for sure. Let's go.
(Madeline and Louise saunter over to Rory and Dean.)
RORY: So, should we dance or should we sit first?
LOUISE: Rory...you came. Oh, great dress. Who's it by?
RORY: Lorelai Gilmore.
MADELINE: You made it yourself?
RORY: No, my mom made it for me.
MADELINE: (impressed) She did? Really?
RORY: Yeah.
LOUISE: So you traveling with a bodyguard now?
RORY: Oh, no. This is my -- this is Dean. Dean, this is Louise and Madeline.
DEAN: Hey.
MADELINE: My mom can't make anything.
LOUISE: (flirting) How tall are you?
DEAN: Uh...
MADELINE: Soup! She can make soup!
LOUISE: You know, my whole family is really tall. The men, mostly. What are you -- 6'1", 6'2"?
RORY: What, does he get like a prize if he guesses?
MADELINE: One kind of soup, actually. It's green, lumpy.
DEAN: I'm 6'2".
MADELINE: Actually, she can't make soup either.
LOUISE: Six-two's a good height.
DEAN: You think?
LOUISE: I think.
DEAN: Huh.
(Dean moves behind Rory and puts his arms around her waist.)
DEAN: What do you think? Too tall?
RORY: Not in heels.
DEAN: Good.
RORY: Although the saddle shoes make it kind of difficult.
DEAN: Well I'll just have to stoop then.
RORY: I guess so.
LOUISE: OK. I'm bored.
(Louise turns and walks away.)
MADELINE: I like your dress.
RORY: Thanks.
(Madeline follows Louise. A slow song starts as Rory turns in Dean's arms.)
RORY: Hey, you're nice.
DEAN: Slow song.
RORY: Let's go.
(Rory and Dean are about to dance when Paris and her date walk up to them.)
PARIS: Rory.
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: I see you came.
RORY: You sold me the ticket.
JACOB: I'm Jacob.
RORY: Hi, I'm Rory. This is Dean.
DEAN: Hi.
JACOB: Hi.
PARIS: Excuse us.
(Paris drags Jacob away.)
PARIS: Those are not friends.
JACOB: I was being polite.
PARIS: Well don't
DEAN: So, that's Paris?
RORY: Yes, it is.
DEAN: She seems fun.
RORY: Oh, yeah, she is.
DEAN: OK, so, this dancing thing is not something I want you to get used to or comment on.
RORY: Now, that goes both ways.
(They start to dance.)
DEAN: Hey, if I kiss you is a nun gonna come out here and boot me out of here
RORY: It's not a Catholic school.
DEAN: So I can kiss you?
RORY: Yeah, you can kiss me.
(Tristin is watching Rory and Dean kissing.)
CISSY: OK, I'm perfect now.
TRISTIN: (without enthusiasm) Great.
CISSY: You wanna dance?
TRISTIN: Nope.
CISSY: You wanna eat?
TRISTIN: Nope.
CISSY: You wanna go make out?
TRISTIN: Yeah, alright, let's go.
DEAN: So, Ponyboy, you happy?
RORY: Yeah, I'm happy.
(Cut to Lorelai and Emily.)
EMILY: There you go.
LORELAI: Mom, I think somebody already ate that.
EMILY: That is a mashed banana on toast.
LORELAI: OK.
EMILY: I used to make this for you all the time when you were a little girl.
LORELAI: You did?
EMILY: Yes, whenever you got sick I made this.
LORELAI: Are you sure it wasn't the other way around?
EMILY: You don't want it.
LORELAI: No, no, I want it.
EMILY: I'll just take it back to the kitchen
LORELAI: No, Mom, I said I want it.
EMILY: Are you sure? Because I can throw it away.
LORELAI: Relinquish the banana, please. Mmm.
EMILY: You can't possibly be comfortable like that.
LORELAI: Mother, please, this is the first position in 24 hours that that has not made me crazy.
EMILY: Alright. (pause) You're not eating.
LORELAI: Mom.
EMILY: Yes?
LORELAI: Please don't make me eat this.
EMILY: You have to eat something.
LORELAI: Well, Sookie left me a burrito in the fridge.
EMILY: I'll go warm it up for you.
LORELAI: I can eat it cold.
EMILY: Oh. Fine. I'll just go get it then.
LORELAI: Hot's better though.
EMILY: I'll be right back.
(Cut to the dance.)
DEAN: OK, uh, I need something to drink. Do you want some punch?
RORY: Sure.
(Jacob approaches Rory when Dean goes to get their punch.)
JACOB: Hi, Rory, right?
RORY: Yes.
JACOB: We met earlier with Paris...
RORY: Yes, I remember.
JACOB: Are you having a good time?
RORY: Actually I am. You?
JACOB: It's OK. So, was that your boyfriend?
RORY: Oh. I don't know. I'm not sure.
JACOB: You're not sure?
RORY: We've only been going out a little while, so...
JACOB: So, there's still a little room to play?
RORY: What?
JACOB: Would you like to dance?
RORY: Oh, no thanks.
JACOB: Maybe I could get your number.
RORY: What for?
JACOB: To call you.
RORY: I'm sorry, aren't you here with Paris?
JACOB: Yeah.
RORY: So maybe you shouldn't be over here asking me for my number then.
JACOB: Why? Paris is my cousin.
RORY: Your cousin?
JACOB: Yeah.
RORY: Paris is your cousin? You're related?
JACOB: Yeah.
RORY: Jacob, it's been very nice to meet you. I hope you have a lovely evening.



(Cut to Lorelai and Emily watching TV.)
EMILY: Oh look -- Barbara Stanwyck. I just love Barbara Stanwyck.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, she's good.
EMILY: She had that wonderful voice -- that husky, deep voice. I just love that voice.
LORELAI: You know Mom, you have kind of a Barbara Stanwycky voice.
EMILY: Oh I do not.
LORELAI: I mean it. You could have gotten Fred McMurray to off Dad if you'd really wanted to.
EMILY: Oh you do enjoy teasing me, don't you?
LORELAI: You know, I really do.
EMILY: You know, Rory looked so lovely tonight.
LORELAI: She did, didn't she?
EMILY: I just can't get over how she's grown up into that little woman who walked out of here.
LORELAI: I know. (pause) You know what, Mom?
EMILY: You did a lovely job.
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: With Rory and the dress.
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: Well, let me get this out of your way. You really don't remember me making this for you when you were sick?
LORELAI: I don't. I'm sorry
EMILY: Well I did and you loved it.
LORELAI: You know what? Let me give it a try.
(Lorelai bites into the toast.)
LORELAI: Hmm.
EMILY: Yes?
LORELAI: It's even more disgusting than I thought it was going to be.
EMILY: Oh it is not.
(Emily takes a bite and makes a face.)
EMILY: Oh my God, it's horrible! What on earth was I thinking?
(Cut to the dance.)
DEAN: So, uh, you want to maybe go?
RORY: You're bored. I'm sorry. Yeah, let's go, right away.
DEAN: I'm not bored. I thought, you know, there's still a little time left, maybe we could get a cup of coffee somewhere, hang out a little, talk a walk. You know, just us.
RORY: That'd be nice.
DEAN: No, you stay. I'll get the coats.
(After Dean leaves, Paris walks up to Rory sitting at the table and leans into her.)
PARIS: So. How many people have you told? Four? Five? Everybody?
RORY: What are you talking about?
PARIS: You know that Jacob is my cousin and now you finally have all the amm*nit*on to pay me back, right?
(The people nearby are starting to stare.)
RORY: I don't want to pay you back. I just want to get awy from you.
PARIS: (voice gets increasingly louder) Now you can just go all over the school and just tell everybody that Paris Geller couldn't get a date to the dance. That she had no one and since she couldn't just not come, she had to get her mother to ask her cousin Jacob to take and then she had to give him gas money to make him do it. Go ahead! Tell them!
RORY: I don't have to. You just did.
(Paris and Rory look around. Everyone has stopped dancing and is listening to them. Paris walks away.)
(Dean is returning with the coats.)
TRISTIN: You know, we haven't met.
DEAN: No, we haven't.
TRISTIN: I'm Tristin.
DEAN: Ah, yes we have.
TRISTIN: What are you talking about?
DEAN: Rory's mentioned you.
TRISTIN: Oh yeah?
DEAN: Yeah. I wouldn't get quite so excited about it.
TRISTIN: Oh, why, did she say something mean?
DEAN: She said you're a jackass.
TRISTIN: Really?
DEAN: Actually, no, Rory doesn't use words like that. I embellished a little.
TRISTIN: Oh so you're the big strong protector? Little princess needs a protector?
DEAN: What's your problem, man?
TRISTIN: Nothing. Just don't like your girlfriend, that's all.
DEAN: Really? Doesn't look that way to me.
TRISTIN: I don't really care how it looks to you.
DEAN: Hey. You got in my path, not the other way around.
(Dean starts to walk away. Tristin steps in his way.)
DEAN: You're kiding right?
TRISTIN: Why, are you going somewhere?
DEAN: Get out of my way Dristan.
TRISTIN: Oh, aren't you clever.
(Rory steps between them.)
RORY: Hey, what's going on?
TRISTIN: Nothing. Just getting to know your boyfriend here.
DEAN: It's going really well, don't you think?
TRISTIN: Oh yeah. We're just about to build a clubhouse.
RORY: OK. Well I hate to break up the party, but we should go.
TRISTIN: Oh, why? Little girl's got to be home?
DEAN: Stop.
TRISTIN: No, I think you two make a very cute couple. Is your horse and buggy parked outside? Got to get home for the barn raising?
DEAN: Let's go.
(Dean and Rory start to walk away. Tristin steps in front of Rory. Dean shoves Tristin. People around them stop dancing and start watching the two guys.)
DEAN: What the hell do you think you're doing?
TRISTIN: OK, you will not push me again.
DEAN: Are you seriously trying to act tough? You're wearing a tie for God's sake.
TRISTIN: Outside! Now!
(The music stops abruptly.)
DEAN: I'm not fighting you. It'd be like fighting an accountant. I'll call you when I need my taxes done.
(Tristin lunges for Dean. It takes a few other boys and a man to separate them.)
DEAN: You don't want to fight me Tristin!
TRISTIN: Why not?
DEAN: 'Cause I'll k*ll you, idiot! Come on, Rory, let's go.
(As Rory and Dean walk away, Tristin breaks free from the people holding him back. Dean turns around and gets in his face.)
DEAN: You will not come near her. Ever again.
(Dean and Rory leave.)
MADELINE: Wow. That was good.
LOUISE: Whatever.
(Paris runs up to Tristin.)
PARIS: Are you OK?
(Tristin keeps walking.)
LOUISE: Did you really bring your cousin?
(Paris walks off.)
(Cut to Lorelai's house. Lorelai is sleeping on the couch. Emily is still watching TV. She reaches over for the remote control.)
LORELAI: (sleepy) What are you doing?
EMILY: Go to sleep.
LORELAI: The movie's not over.
EMILY: I'll tell you how it ends.
(Emily tucks Lorelai's hair behind her ear and covers her with a blanket.)
LORELAI: Thank you, Mommy.
(Emily sits in a chair to read.)
(Cut to Rory and Dean walking outdoors in Stars Hollow.)
DEAN: That was quite a dance.
RORY: I seriously don't know what got into him.
DEAN: I do.
RORY: What?
DEAN: He has a thing for you.
RORY: No he doesn't. It's just a game to him or something.
DEAN: He has a thing for you.
RORY: He does nothing but insult me and make me miserable.
DEAN: He has a thing for you.
RORY: I don't know how I feel about this whole situation.
DEAN: What do you mean?
RORY: I don't know...having my boyfriend defend my honor. It's weird.
DEAN: Uh, boyfriend?
RORY: What?
DEAN: You said 'boyfriend.'
RORY: No! I just meant boyfriend in the sense that the whole defending me thing was very boyfriendy, but only in the broadest sense of the word, which doesn't even apply at all here.
DEAN: You are seriously babbling.
RORY: I didn't mean that you're my boyfriend.
DEAN: OK.
RORY: I don't think you're my boyfriend.
DEAN: OK.
(pause)
RORY: Dean?
DEAN: What?
RORY: Are you my boyfriend?
DEAN: In the broadest sense of the word way?
RORY: No, in the real, 'hi this is Dean, my boyfriend' kind of way.
DEAN: Well I am if you want me to be.
RORY: I do.
DEAN: OK.
RORY: So it's settled.
DEAN: Yes it is.
RORY: You're my boyfriend.
DEAN: That's the consensus.
RORY: I'm feeling pretty good about this decision. (The door to Miss Patty's dance studio is open.)
RORY: I guess Miss Patty forgot to lock up.
DEAN: I've never really seen in here before.
(They're inside, looking at the pictures on the walls.)
DEAN: Are all these women really Miss Patty?
RORY: Yep. She said she's done everything there is to do in show business except set fire to the hoop the dog jumps through.
(Rory drops her purse.)
DEAN: I'll get it. God, this weighs a ton. What do you have in here?
RORY: I don't know. A lipstick, five dollar bill. Gum, hair spray, a book.
DEAN: A book?
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: You brought a book to the dance?
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: You thought there'd be a lot of downtime?
RORY: No. I just take a book with me everywhere. It's just habit.
DEAN: So, uh, what are you reading?
RORY: The Portable Dorothy Parker.
(She shows him the book.)
DEAN: (reading) 'There's little in taking or giving. There's little in water or wine. This living, this living, this living, Was never a project of mine.' Cheery.
(They settle into a comfortable chair together.)
RORY: Funny though. (pause) Hey --
DEAN: What?
RORY: Thank you for tonight. It was perfect.
DEAN: You're welcome.
(They kiss then continue to look at the book.)
(Time lapse. They've fallen asleep.)
(Time lapse. They're still asleep. Miss Patty and a large group of women come into the dance studio.)
MISS PATTY: OK, ladies. Grab your yoga mats.
WOMAN: I don't think I'll ever get warm again.
(The women gather around Rory and Dean.)
WOMAN: (shocked) Oh, my goodness! It's Lorelai's girl!
WOMAN #2: Patty! Rory Gilmore is here!
MISS PATTY: What?
WOMAN: She's over here. Asleep with the bag boy from the market.
WOMAN #2: What are we supposed to do?
MISS PATTY: Rory, honey. It's Miss Patty. Rory? Rory, what are you doing here?
RORY: Miss Patty?
MISS PATTY: Yes. have you been here all night?
RORY: Oh no! Dean wake up.
DEAN: What time is it?
MISS PATTY: It's 5:30 in the morning.
RORY: Oh my God! We fell asleep. How could we have fallen asleep?
DEAN: Calm down, I'll explain it to your mom.
RORY: (hysterical) Where's my purse? Where's my purse?
DEAN: I got it. Relax.
RORY: I have to go.
(Rory runs out.)
DEAN: Rory! (runs after her) Wait up!
RORY: I have to go.
DEAN: I'm going with you. We'll explain. It'll be OK.
RORY: No you can't come with me. You shouldn't be anywhere near my house right now.
DEAN: It's not our fault.
RORY: I know. I just have to get home.
DEAN: Look, please, please let me come with you.
RORY: No!
DEAN: Rory --
RORY: I have to go home.
(Rory runs down the street towards home. Dean lets her go.)
(Cut to Lorelai's house. Emily is shaking Lorelai awake.)
EMILY: Lorelai! Get up. Now. Right now!
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Rory's not home!
LORELAI: Rory's what?
EMILY: I sat in that chair all night and I dozed off for one second and the next thing I know it's 5:30 and she's not here.
LORELAI: Rory?
EMILY: She's not there. Aren't you listening?
LORELAI: (panicked) Rory? Rory?
EMILY: Where's the phone? Call the police.
(Lorelai looks around.)
EMILY: What are you doing? Call the police! Call the police!
LORELAI: Mom, stop it!
EMILY: What are you doing?
LORELAI: I'm looking for the phone. What do you think I'm doing?
EMILY: Why don't you ever clean up around here? This is an emergency and you can't even find the phone. What if there was a fire? What if Rory was choking?
LORELAI: Mom, stop yelling!
EMILY: Rory is missing!
LORELAI: I know that and your yelling is not helping me!
(They continue looking for the phone. It rings)
LORELAI: Rory? (pause) Oh, Patty. (pause) What? (pause) OK. (pause) Thanks. (pause) No, than you so much. (pause) OK Bye-bye. (hangs up) Rory's OK.
EMILY: Where is she? What happened?
LORELAI: She and Dean were at Miss Patty's.
EMILY: What is that, a motel?
LORELAI: Um, it's a dance studio. That was Patty. She said that she found them asleep and woke them up and Rory's on her way home.
EMILY: In what state were they found in?
LORELAI: She didn't say, OK. Let's just try to be calm until we know what happened.
EMILY: What do you mean 'until we know what happened'? We know what happened.
LORELAI: No we don't.
EMILY: They were out all night!
LORELAI: I'm gonna make some coffee.
EMILY: Lorelai Gilmore, I've watched you do a lot of stupid things in your life and I have held my tongue.
LORELAI: (laughs) You've what?
EMILY: But I will not stand by and let you allow that girl to ruin her life.
LORELAI: Mom -- back off.
EMILY: She spent the night out with that boy, the one you let her run off to that dance with.
LORELAI: Mom, so help me God, I will not get into this with you.
EMILY: She's doing the same thing you did.
LORELAI: No she's not.
EMILY: She's going to get pregnant.
LORELAI: No she's not.
EMILY: She's gonna ruin everything just like you did.
LORELAI: No she's not! No she's not! No she's not! Rory is a good kid, Mom! She's not me.
EMILY: What kind of mother are you to allow this to happen to her?
LORELAI: Oh, I don't know, Mom. What kind of mother were you?
EMILY: You're going to lose her. You're going to lose her just like I lost you.
LORELAI: I am not going to lose her. Do you hear me? Even if I hadn't gotten pregnant, you still would have lost me. I had nothing in that house. I had no life. I had no air. You strangled me. I do not strangle Rory.
EMILY: Oh you're so perfect and I was so horrible. I put you in good schools. I gave you the best of everything. I made sure you had the finest opportunities. And I am so tired of hearing about how you were suffocated and I was so controlling. Well if I was so controlling why couldn't I control you running around getting pregnant and throwing your life away.
LORELAI: Get out!
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: You will not come into my house and tell me I threw my life away. Look around, Mom. This is a life. It has a little color in it so it may look a little unfamiliar to you, but it's a life. And if I hadn't gotten pregnant I wouldn't have Rory.
(Rory sneaks in the front door and hides by the stairs.)
EMILY: You know that's not what I meant.
LORELAI: Maybe I was some horrible uncontrollable child like you say, but Rory isn't. She's smart and careful and I trust her and she's gonna be fine and if you can't accept that or believe it, then I don't want you in this house!
(Emily walks out and slams the door. Rory creeps into the kitchen.)
RORY: Mom, thank you for saying all those --
LORELAI: What were you thinking? Staying out all night! Are you insane?
RORY: I'm sorry. It was an accident.
LORELAI: You're talking to the queen of staying out all night. I invented the concept! This is no accident! You can't do this! Period.
RORY: Nothing happened!
LORELAI: Do you have any idea what it's like to wake up with my mother here and find out that you never came home?
RORY: So all this is about Grandma being here.
LORELAI: No, it's about the feeling of complete terror when your kid isn't in her bed in the morning.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LOREAI: And then it's about a whole different kind of terror when you find out that she spent the night with some guy.
RORY: I didn't spend the night with him. We fell asleep.
LORELAI: You are going on the pill.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You're not getting pregnant.
RORY: I'm not sleeping with Dean.
LORELAI: Dammit!
RORY: What happened to all that stuff you said to Grandma What happened to trusting me? Where did all that go?
LORELAI: I think it's back on Patty's yoga mats.
RORY: This is crap! You know I didn't do anything. You know this is an accident. You're just mad because I screwed up and I did it in front of Grandma and she nailed you for it. Well I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I screwed up and I'm sorry that you got yelled at, but I didn't do anything and you know it!
(Rory goes into her room and slams the door. Lorelai sits at the kitchen table and cries.)

CUT TO MISS PATTY'S STUDIO
MISS PATTY: People please pay attention. Now, I want my before Mary over here, and my after Mary over here. Wise men, shepherd line up for the processional. I only have half a donkey? I need the rest of the donkey!
[Kirk standing on stool while Lorelai hemming]
KIRK: Ow!
LORELAI: Hold still Kirk.
KIRK: You stuck me.
LORELAI: I did not stick you.
KIRK: You did to.
LORELAI: Ok, be quiet now. [looks at Rory]
RORY: Um, Taylor, the baby Jesus is missing an arm again.
TAYLOR: What?
RORY: I was just getting it out of the trunk and -
TAYLOR: Let me see that. Oh for Pete's sake! [to everyone] Ok listen up! The arm is missing! I repeat the arm is missing!
RORY: Maybe it's just time to get a new baby Jesus, you know, one that's a boy.
TAYLOR: It's a doll, no one can tell.
RORY: Well it has a bow.
TAYLOR: This has been the baby Jesus in every Christmas pageant since 1965. Were you here in 1965?
RORY: No I wasn't.
TAYLOR: Find the arm [Rory looks at Lorelai]
LORELAI: What are you doing?
KIRK: Nothing.
LORELAI: You're flinching.
KIRK: You stuck me once. There's nothing to say you won't do it again.
LORELAI: Ok you know what? You're done.
TAYLOR: Well?
RORY: I swear, I've looked twice.
TAYLOR: Look again.
MISS PATTY: Taylor come quickly. Our before' Mary is about to become an after'. Who else in town is knocked up?
[Lorelai and Rory look at each other awkwardly then look away. Pan to them leaving]
LORELAI: Find the arm?
RORY: Nope.
LORELAI: [sourly]It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. [pan to dog with doll arm in mouth]
CUT TO RORY STANDING IN A GAZEBO
[Lane runs up to her]
LANE: Hey, I thought we were meeting at Luke's.
RORY: We were? Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I forgot.
LANE: Let me guess. You and Lorelai haven't made up yet?
RORY: Nope. Things are still Miracle Worker at my house. God, how did everything get so screwed up?
LANE: I think you staying out all night with Dean had something to do with it.
RORY: And my grandmother being there to witness it didn't help.
LANE: Never does.
RORY: It sucks. Things were good. School was good, Dean was good. Now my mother and I are barely speaking. Mom and Grandma are barely speaking. Dean's new name is Narcolepsy boy'.
LANE: How's he taking it?
RORY: I don't know. I haven't talked to him since it happened.
LANE: That was four days ago.
RORY: I know.
LANE: Has he called?
RORY: I told him not to.
LANE: And he listened?
RORY: No.
LANE: Good boy.
RORY: Ok, I really need to talk about something else now.
LANE: You went shopping.
RORY: Yes I did. I got a mow-ing cow shaped timer for Sookie, some cardio-salsa tapes for Michel, a book for Dean -
LANE: You got Dean a book?
RORY: Yeah. Metamorphosis'.
LANE: Metamorphosis.'
RORY: It's Kafta.
LANE: Very romantic.
RORY: I think it is romantic.
LANE: I know I've always dreamed that some day a guy would get me a really confusing Czechoslovakian novel.
RORY: I think he'll appreciate it.
LANE: A book sends the wrong message.
RORY: What are you talking about?
LANE: You have to look at what a gift says to the other person, not to you. Remember two years ago, I got my mom that perfume?
RORY: Yeah.
LANE: Ok, to me that said, Hey mom, you work hard, you deserve something fancy'. Now to my mother, it said Hey mom, here's some smelly sex juice, the kind I use to lure boys with' and resulted in me being sent to Bible camp all summer.
RORY: Yeah but -
LANE: Just imaging that you actually gave Dean something really romantic, and he gave you a football. Your hypothetical romantic present is saying that you really, really like him. And his present is saying Hey man, let's just be friends'.
RORY: And you're saying that this book is -
LORELAI: Is a Czechoslovakian football, yes.
RORY: So then what do I get him?
LANE: What you should do is find out what he's getting you and gauge your gift accordingly.
RORY: But doesn't that kinda take the fun out of it?
LANE: Gift giving is serious business. If you don't believe me try spending a month at Korean Bible camp.
CUT TO INN
MICHEL: Yes right there. Now flip the elf and the fairy.
GUY: Which one is the fairy?
MICHEL: The one with the wand [Guy goes for one] What are you doing?
GUY: Isn't this a wand?
MICHEL: No, that is a staff.
GUY: So this isn't a fairy?
MICHEL: That is Little Bo Peep.
GUY: And you don't want to move her.
MICHEL: I would prefer that you didn't.
GUY: Ok, so we're still looking for a fairy.
MICHEL: The search continues.
GUY: No chance you're going to help me.
MICHEL: None whatsoever.
[phone rings]
LORELAI: Independence Inn, Lorelai speaking.
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Mom, hello.
EMILY: I wanted to talk to you about the Christmas dinner this Friday.
LORELAI: Ah, Christmas dinner.
EMILY: You forgot.
LORELAI: Well mom, there's been a lot going on around here lately, your Christmas shindig's not exactly high on my list of things to obsess about.
EMILY: Well I'm sorry if the timing is bad Lorelai, but the world doesn't always revolve around you.
LORELAI: Well thanks for the tip.
EMILY: Cocktails are at 6, dinner's at 8.
LORELAI: I probably won't be there for cocktails.
EMILY: Why not?
LORELAI: Because I have to work.
EMILY: You can't leave work early?
LORELAI: No I can't.
EMILY: Why not?
LORELAI: Because it's not in my job description.
EMILY: Well then don't come.
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Don't come. It's obviously an enormous burden for you.
LORELAI: Yeah but -
EMILY: Just send Rory.
LORELAI: You're telling me not to come to the Christmas party?
EMILY: Well you're obviously too busy.
LORELAI: I had the German measles in the 5th grade, I still had to show up to the Christmas party.
EMILY: Lorelai let's be honest here, I'm not too happy with you right now and I assume you're not too happy with me.
LORELAI: My polka dot dress matched my face and still I had to sit through 12 courses.
EMILY: I am tired of forcing you to do all those terrible things that infringe upon your life and I do not have the energy to pretend that the way you treated my the other day was in any way acceptable.
LORELAI: So you're uninviting me to Christmas dinner?
EMILY: Yes I am.
LORELAI: Fine.
EMILY: Fine.
LORELAI: Ok, anything else?
EMILY: I believe that's all.
LORELAI: Ok well, great mom, it's been swell talking to you.
EMILY: Bye Lorelai.
LORELAI: Bye.
[Pan to Michel and guy]
GUY: This one?
MICHEL: No.
GUY: This one?
MICHEL: No.
GUY: This -
MICHEL: No.
[guy points]
MICHEL: No.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
RORY: I wish you'd change your mind.
LORELAI: It's not my mind that needs to be changed.
RORY: I don't think she meant it.
LORELAI: Oh she meant it.
RORY: Well maybe she thinks she meant it at the time, but I bet she won't mean it later when I show up there without you.
LORELAI: And without a map to follow that reasoning I say, Take a hot it's cold outside'.
RORY: You just wanna hold a grudge.
LORELAI: Yes, it burns more calories.
RORY: That's not true.
LORELAI: Yes it is, how do you think your grandma got those legs of hers? She's not exactly a Stairmaster gal.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Never saw her on the running track.
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: I don't remember the country club organizing a Tae-bo class.
RORY: Fine, forget it. Should I put your name on Grandma's present?
LORELAI: Yes, sign it the inn keeper formally known as her daughter.
RORY: You know what I think?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I think you're acting a little immature.
LORELAI: I'm not acting.
RORY: Well what about the apple tarts? You wait all year for those apple tarts.
LORELAI: I can live without the apple tarts.
RORY: You've made up songs after eating five of them with lyrics that contradict that last statement.
LORELAI: Oh you know what? You have to go, you're late.
RORY: You really won't come?
LORELAI: What, I'm sorry, is somebody speaking? Couldn't be Rory, she's already half way to Hartford.
RORY: Fine, I'm going.
LORELAI: Drive carefully. Watch out for ice. And bring me back one of those [door closes]..tarts!
CUT TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE
[Doorbell]
RORY: Hi Grandma.
EMILY: Rory, come in. You look lovely.
RORY: This is from me and mom.
EMILY: Well aren't you thoughtful? I'll just put it under the tree.
RORY: You know mom actually picked it out.
EMILY: Rory, do you know Holland Prescott?
RORY: I met her last year.
EMILY: Holland, look who's here.
HOLLAND: Hello Rory.
RICHARD: That's not my proposal.
ALAN: Yes, I know. Henry toned it down a little.
RICHARD: Henry did! Henry is a toddler!
ALAN: He thought your take was a little conservative.
RICHARD: And a moron!
ALAN: Richard, be very careful. This man may be our boss one day.
RICHARD: Oh that will never happen.
ALAN: Alright.
RICHARD: Why have you heard something?
EMILY: Richard, Alan, look who's here.
RICHARD: Hello Rory.
RORY: Hi.
ALAN: Where's your mother?
RORY: Oh, well, she...
ALAN: Over by the apple tarts I assume.
EMILY: Lorelai couldn't come tonight.
RICHARD: She couldn't?
EMILY: No, she had to work. [Rory looks at her]
RICHARD: Ah. Speaking of which, I'm going to give that man a call.
ALAN: Richard, you're getting yourself all worked up.
RICHARD: As long as I've been with this company, it has been run by gentleman. Revising a man's work without so much as a phone call would've been unheard of!
ALAN: It's a new world out there Richard.
RICHARD: Oh!
EMILY: Please stop all this shop talk. We are here to celebrate.
RICHARD: I'm going to call him.
ALAN: Richard, it's past midnight in London.
RICHARD: Oh, even better.
RORY: Grandma, could I talk to you alone please.
EMILY: You need something to drink.
RORY: I want to apologize about the other night.
EMILY: Rory please, this is a party.
RORY: I messed up, it's my fault.
EMILY: This is not the time or place to discuss this, your mother should have taught you that.
RORY: Please don't be mad at her.
EMILY: I'm not mad at anyone. Now go back in and join the party.
RORY: But -
EMILY: And take this to Gigi on your way back.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
LORELAI: Yes Joe, I know it's Friday night, but I ordered my pizza an hour ago...Oh no I did not hear about the delivery van...Well I am very, very sorry to hear that. Now was it a fairly new van? Great, ok, well Joe, as with most tragedies in life there come a time when you just need to pick up and move one. So what's the next phase of the delivery saga? Mm-hmm...Well how long until your brother's back with the razor scooter? Ok, uh-huh, alright, just call me when it gets there. Bye Joe.
[Goes into the kitchen, grams a salad bag, pours dressing into it, shakes it and sits down to read a magazine and eat. Hears a knocking at Rory's window. Goes into Rory's room and sees Dean at the window. Opens window]
LORELAI: Well, hi there.
DEAN: Hi.
LORELAI: How you doing?
DEAN: Fine.
LORELAI: Good, good. Shouldn't you have a squeegee with you or something?
DEAN: I was just -
LORELAI: Looking for Rory?
DEAN: Yeah.
LORELAI: She's not here.
DEAN: Ok.
LORELAI: [sighs] I'll tell her you tapped.
DEAN: Thanks.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm [goes to close window but Dean hasn't moved] Something else?
DEAN: I just wanted to say that things got all messed up.
LORELAI: Yes they did.
DEAN: And I'm sorry.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
DEAN: But nothing happened.
LORELAI: Ok, I have to go.
DEAN: We sat down and we were reading this book and then we fell asleep.
LORELAI: Pick a more interesting book next time.
DEAN: So am I like public enemy #1 with you?
LORELAI: #1? I don't know, would you settle for top five? Because I'm still a little hot for that crazy b*mb guy who's been living in a cave for a year.
DEAN: Please just tell me where I stand.
LORELAI: I don't know where you stand ok? All I know is my 16 year old daughter didn't come home one night and you had something to do with that.
DEAN: I told you - nothing happened
LORELAI: [overlaps Dean] Happened, I heard.
DEAN: Look you can hate me but you have to believe me, I would not let anything happen to her.
LORELAI: You happened to her.
DEAN: I won't hurt her.
LORELAI: You know, I was 16 when I had Rory.
DEAN: I know.
LORELAI: That is the same age she is now.
DEAN: I know.
LORELAI: She wants to go to Harvard.
DEAN: She will go to Harvard and if she doesn't it won't be because of me. [sighs and stands to leave]
LORELAI: I don't hate you.
DEAN: No?
LORELAI: No. Though I did imagine 20 different ways to remove your head from your body.
DEAN: Yeah? Well which one looked the best?
LORELAI: Hedge clippers.
DEAN: Huh.
LORELAI: Dull ones.
DEAN: Well, I mean sure you wouldn't want it to go quick.
LORELAI: Exactly.
DEAN: Ok, uh, I'm gonna go.
LORELAI: Dean.
DEAN: Yeah.
LORELAI: You know we have a really nice front door. You might want to use it some times.
DEAN: Got it.
LORELAI: See ya.
CUT TO STREET OUTSIDE LUKE'S
[Lorelai walking to Luke's while people ring bells to the tune of The First Noel]
DIRECTOR: Henry, you ring on 3.
HENRY: I thought I was 2.
DIRECTOR: No, Chuck rings on 2, you ring on 3.
CHUCK: I'm on 1.
DIRECTOR: Are you sure?
CHUCK: Nope. Sorry. You're right. I'm 2.
DIRECTOR: From the top. [they start again] Henry!
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Rory coming?
LORELAI: No.
LUKE: She on a date?
LORELAI: No.
LUKE: Good so you've forbid her to see the bag boy.
LORELAI: I'd really rather not talk about it right now.
LUKE: Just tell me you forbid her to see the bag boy.
LORELAI: I did not forbid her to see the bag boy.
LUKE: Are you crazy?
LORELAI: Well, he looks like he's moving up to produce, so he's suddenly become quite a catch.
LUKE: That kid is trouble.
LORELAI: Can I order please.
LUKE: First time I looked at him, I thought he was trouble.
LORELAI: Excuse me, I'm the one who told you I thought he was trouble and you told me you thought I was crazy.
LUKE: You are crazy and he is trouble.
LORELAI: He is not trouble! He's 6'2...he's beautiful and he's completely in love with my daughter.
LUKE: Trouble.
LORELAI: Big time.
LUKE: I'll get your burger.
LORELAI: Wait. Can I see a menu?
LUKE: You need to see a menu?
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: You come here everyday.
LORELAI: I know, but I usually order the same thing, and tonight I'm in the mood for something a little different.
LUKE: Menu.
LORELAI: Piece of paper, list of food offered.
LUKE: Ok, here. [gives her a menu] It's not in Japanese.
LORELAI: Don't you have any kind of holiday special? Something festive?
LUKE: I just got some Grey Poupon. That's French.
LORELAI: Tonight's my parents big Christmas celebration. There's good food, these amazing apple tarts, big tree. It's the only holiday I actually enjoy going over there for and this year, I'm uninvited.
LUKE: Why the hell would anyone celebrate Christmas two weeks early?
LORELAI: Did you even hear the part about me being uninvited?
LUKE: To your parents' fake Christmas party?
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: I did hear that.
LORELAI: Do you care?
LUKE: Obviously you do.
LORELAI: Yes, I do and I don't know why.
LUKE: You liked going...
LORELAI: I did.
LUKE: Rory's there without you...
LORELAI: She is.
LUKE: You and Rory aren't getting along right now and you feel bad at being separated during a time you usually share together.
LORELAI: Wow.
LUKE: Did I mention you come here every damn day?
LORELAI: I'll have a burger.
LUKE: Coming right up.
CUT TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE
GIGI: Emily, you've out done yourself yet again.
ALAN: Yes, I can't imagine the hours you spent slaving over a hot stove.
EMILY: You're teasing me, Alan.
ALAN: It's delicious Emily.
EMILY: A compliment for my chef is a compliment for me, thank you Alan.
RICHARD: I for one would like to know where Henry is at this hour. Probably gallivanting around London like a bull out to stud.
EMILY: Richard please.
RICHARD: Well how is he supposed to negotiate the contract tomorrow morning if he's been out at all hours with some cheap tramp.
ALAN: Knowing Henry, she wasn't cheap.
EMILY: This is wildly inappropriate dinner conversation especially in front of a young lady.
RICHARD: Is it unbearably hot in here?
EMILY: Richard don't loosen your tie at the table.
HOLLAND: So what are your plans for the Christmas holidays Rory?
RORY: I'll probably just be hanging out with my mom.
GIGI: Oh it's such a shame she couldn't come, she's always such a kick.
EMILY: Lorelai wasn't feeling well so I suggested she stay home.
RICHARD: It is hot in here, I'm going to lower the thermostat [leaves].
HOLLAND: Poor thing, what's wrong with her?
EMILY: She has a touch of the flu. Richard forget the thermostat! [Rory looks at her again]
GIGI: I thought you said she was working?
EMILY: Well she was supposed to work but then she caught the flu so one way or another she couldn't have made it.
GIGI: Tell her we missed her.
RORY: I will.
EMILY: Richard! For heaven sake [getting up to find him]. Richard!
CUT TO LUKE'S
[Slides a Santa face hamburger in front of Lorelai]
LORELAI: What did you do?
LUKE: You wanted something festive.
LORELAI: You made me a Santa burger.
LUKE: It's not big deal.
LORELAI: He has a hat and everything.
LUKE: Yeah, I just cut a piece of wonder bread, you know, poured a little ketchup, piped on a little cream cheese.
LORELAI: No one has ever made me something quite this disgusting before. I thank you.
LUKE: You're welcome.
[Cell phone rings. Luke point at the no cell phone' sign]
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Outside!
LORELAI: Are you kidding? It's like the North Pole out there.
LUKE: Hey, this sign isn't just a decoration.
LORELAI: Honey, nothing in here is a decoration.
LUKE: It's disturbs the other customers.
LORELAI: Oh really? Maybe we should take a vote. [to customers] Who thinks we shouldn't use cell phones in here? [all raise their hands] Well screw democracy. [goes to answer but stops ringing] Perfect, Now I have to check my voice mail.
[Taylor and carolers enter]
ALL: ...the new born king'.
LUKE: Whoa, what's going on?
TAYLOR: Well we were caroling around town and we got a bit chilly and we thought maybe we could trade you a song for some hot chocolate.
LUKE: You want free hot chocolate?
TAYLOR: No no, we'll sing for it, any tune you like.
LUKE: And then I give you free hot chocolate.
TAYLOR: Yes.
LUKE: Tell you want, you can have your hot chocolate, and pay for it, then go next door and sing for the marshmallows.
LORELAI: Oh my God!
TAYLOR: These are your neighbors Luke!
LUKE: Shut up Taylor. What's going on? [to Lorelai]
LORELAI: My father's in the hospital.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Yeah, he collapsed or something. I don't know. I need a cab. I need to call a cab. Where's the phone? I need - can anyone give me - I'm holding a phone.
LUKE: Whoa, calm down.
LORELAI: No I can't calm down. I need a cab. What's the numbers? God, it's something-cabs, cabs-something-something, 1-800-cabs? Can somebody tell me the damn number of the cab guy?!
LUKE: I'll drive you.
LORELAI: But there's food and there's people and there's a burger with a face.
LUKE: Ok, everybody out! We're closed, let's go. Food's on me. [to Lorelai] Put on your coat and get your stuff. [to Taylor] Taylor, have your hot chocolate then lock up. [to Lorelai] Come on, my truck's out back.
LORELAI: Luke, I'm -
LUKE: I know, let's go.
CUT TO INSIDE TRUCK
LORELAI: Look.
LUKE: Relax.
LORELAI: We're being passed by senior citizens.
LUKE: I'm going as fast as I can.
LORELAI: Bye Grandma, bye.
LUKE: There's ice on the road, those people aren't being safe.
LORELAI: Well maybe they're not being safe but at least they're getting somewhere.
LUKE: You checked it five times already, I've listened to it twice, it's not changing.
LORELAI: Grandpa's in the hospital, please come.' No details, no info. Who taught her to leave a message like that?
LUKE: I'm sure she was in a hurry.
LORELAI: A person needs details. Why is he in the hospital? How bad is it? What are the circumstances involving him being in the hospital? These are simple questions.
LUKE: We'll be there very soon and you'll know everything.
LORELAI: What if he's dead?
LUKE: He's not dead.
LORELAI: How do you know?
LUKE: I know.
LORELAI: Oh, you're psychic now? You're suddenly getting visions while you're driving 20 mph in the oldest truck known to man? [pause] I'm sorry, you're k*ll yourself to get me there and I'm yelling at you. I don't mean it.
LUKE: I know.
LORELAI: I feel like this is one of those moments when I should be remembering all the great times I had with my dad, you know. The time he took me shopping for a Barbie or to the circus or fishing and my mind is a complete blank.
LUKE: Well I'm sure it happened.
LORELAI: No it didn't. We never did any of that. He went to work, he came home, he read the paper, he went to bed, I snuck out the window. Simple. He was a very by the numbers guy. I was never very good with numbers.
LUKE: I'm sure he loves you.
LORELAI: You know my dad is not a bad guy.
LUKE: I'm sure he's not.
LORELAI: He lived his life the way he thought he was supposed to. He followed the rules taught to him by his non-fishing-non-Barbie-buying dad. He worked hard. He bought a nice house. He provided for my mom. All he asked in return was for his daughter to wear white dresses and go to cotillion and want the same life that he had. What a disappointment it must have been for him to get me.
LUKE: I can't imagine anyone seeing you as a disappointment.
LORELAI: I bet you'd buy a Barbie for your daughter.
LUKE: Yeah, well, I'd probably give her the cash to buy it herself and meet her by the baseball cards.
LORELAI: Hmm. You'll make a great dad.
LUKE: You make a great mom.
LORELAI: Yeah. It's just the uh, daughter part I don't have down yet.
LUKE: Ok, hold on. That Camaro is dust.



CUT TO HOSPITAL
EMILY: But why can't I see him.?
NURSE: They're running some test.
EMILY: Well I would like to meet this doctor who's testing him.
NURSE: You will.
EMILY: Some strange man is working on my husband, I have a right to meet this person.
NURSE: You will.
EMILY: And I want to see the room you're going to put him in.
NURSE: You will.
EMILY: And stop saying You will'. Put a proper sentence together for God's sake.
NURSE: Ma'am, please wait here.
RORY: Did you find out anything?
EMILY: Please! They run this place like the CIA [Joshua comes up] Joshua, thank God! This place is infuriating.
JOSHUA: It's alright, I'm here, I'm going to check on him right now. Have you filled out the forms yet?
EMILY: I don't care about the forms, I want to see my husband.
JOSHUA: [to Rory] Is she being obstinate?
RORY: Very.
JOSHUA: Let me see what's going on and then we'll take it from there.
EMILY: And there he goes through the doors.
RORY: Maybe I should call mom again.
EMILY: Never mind, I'm sure she's very busy.
RORY: That's not true, I bet she'd -
EMILY: Rory, go get your Grandfather a paper -
RORY: But -
EMILY: The Wall Street Journal or Barron's. Whatever they have, he'll want something to read when he gets back to his room.
RORY: Ok, can I get you something? Maybe a coffee?
EMILY: No dear, I'm fine.
[Grandma goes around the corner and calls Lorelai's house but gets the answering machine and hangs up. Goes back to the waiting area]
NURSE: Ms. Gilmore, uh, I need you to -
EMILY: It's not Ms. Gilmore', it's Mrs. Gilmore! Mrs. Gilmore, I'm not a cosmo woman!
NURSE: I know this is difficult for you, but if you don't fill out these forms -
EMILY: What? You'll do what? I'd like to hear in your most condescending tone what my punishment will be for not filling out these forms in a timely manner. Are there bamboo sh**t involved? Some sort of dark deep hole in the ground? Rats nibbling at my toes?
[Pan to Lorelai and Luke in the hospital]
LUKE: Ok, we're supposed to follow the blue line, around the corner and then we should be -
LORELAI: Where's the scarecrow when you need him?
LUKE: Ok, we have to ask someone else.
LORELAI: No! No! We just have to pick one.
LUKE: Ah, well can't just wander around here aimlessly.
LORELAI: Luke, listen to me, somewhere in this hospital are my mother and my father. Now I know I don't get along with them but there has to be some sort of intuition, some sort of blood bond that will somehow lead me to them.
LUKE: That's crazy.
[overhear]
EMILY: My great uncle founded this hospital -
LORELAI: And that's Emily.
EMILY: You insensitive paper peddler! His portrait is hanging in the lobby, go look. It's right above the sign that says Founder'!
LORELAI: Mom!
EMILY: Lorelai.
LORELAI: What's going on? How is he?
EMILY: You came!
LORELAI: Well of course I came. How's dad?
EMILY: That's what I've been trying to find out but this woman keeps pestering me with idiotic questions like What's the number of my insurance policy and how long have we had it.'
NURSE: I need to get this information.
EMILY: You need to get sensitivity training!
LORELAI: Well, what if I fill out this information and you can go find someone who can tell us how my dad is.
NURSE: I'm not supposed to -
LORELAI: Or, I could go and you can stay here and continue to discuss this with my mother
[Nurse looks at Emily]
NURSE: I'll go.
LORELAI: Thank you.
EMILY: You got rid of her.
LORELAI: Yes, so tell me what happened.
EMILY: That's amazing.
LORELAI: Mom, please.
EMILY: I don't know what happened. He was hot and he went to turn down the thermostat and then - [see Luke] were you on a date?
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: You have an escort?
LORELAI: No, it's Luke, Mom.
LUKE: Which is her way of saying we weren't on a date.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.
EMILY: Well how am I supposed to know you weren't on a date. It's Friday night and you show up here with a man.
LORELAI: With Luke, Mom.
EMILY: It's not insane to assume a date was involved.
LORELAI: You're right, ok, it's entirely possible that I was out on a date.
LUKE: Just not with me.
LORELAI: I was eating at Luke's when I got the message. He gave me a ride, end of story. Is Dr. Reynolds here?
EMILY: Yes, Joshua got her a while ago. He was supposed to come back the minute he knew something but he hasn't been back yet.
LORELAI: Well let's go find him.
EMILY: You can't find him! You can't find anyone! Everyone just keeps disappearing behind those doors!
LORELAI: Well come on, let's go [goes through doors]
EMILY: I didn't know you could do that. [follows Lorelai]
LUKE: I'll wait here.
[Rory come up]
RORY: Luke.
LUKE: I gave your mom a ride. We weren't on a date.
RORY: Oh, ok.
LUKE: She and your grandmother just went back to see if they can find a doctor.
RORY: Did they find out anything else about Grandpa?
LUKE: I don't think so, but give your mom a couple of minutes back there, I bet she finds something out.
RORY: Thanks for bringing her.
LUKE: You're welcome. Hey, you ok?
RORY: I don't want him to die.
LUKE: Well you tell him that when you see him ok? People like to hear that.
[Lorelai comes through doors]
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Hey, you! Hi.
RORY: It was horrible! It happened so fast.
LORELAI: They're about to bring him out of the big test room any minute so just hang in there.
RORY: Where's Grandma?
LORELAI: Kicking some patient out of the room with the good view.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: I hope they get him unhooked fast, otherwise he's going without the life support machine.
RORY: So how long before they bring him back?
LORELAI: Very soon.
RORY: I'd like to do something?
LORELAI: Like rollerblade?
RORY: Like get some coffee or make phone calls or do something that isn't standing here waiting.
LORELAI: Ok, go it. Well as partial as I am to the phone, I'm voting for the get coffee' idea.
RORY: Ok, good. Luke tea?
LUKE: Ah, peppermint preferably.
RORY: I'll be right back.
LORELAI: Hey, he's gonna be fine.
RORY: I was just getting to know him.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: I don't want him to -
LORELAI: He's not. Go get your coffee. [Rory leaves] Oh man! [sits with Luke]
LUKE: You're very brave for her.
LORELAI: Yeah, well it's my turn. God this sucks.
LUKE: Hey come on, you gotta think positive here - bright side, good thoughts. Rainbows, unicorns, clowns, little cute...furry - ok I'm out.
LORELAI: Thank God.
[Grandma comes through doors]
EMILY: Alright, we've secured him the room but the pillows are completely unacceptable. I'm gonna see if I can find him some down ones and some slippers. I'll be right back.
LORELAI: We'll be right here [gurney passes. Luke breathes deeply, head back] Jeez are you ok?
LUKE: Yeah, I'm just not big on hospitals you know the smell, people being wheeled by with tubes sticking out of them, you know, drainage, fluids, gaping holes -
LORELAI: Ok, listen, why don't you go home.
LUKE: You want me to go?
LORELAI: You don't look so good.
LUKE: Thanks.
LORELAI: That's not what I meant. You know you always look good.
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: I mean you always look healthy.
LUKE: Ok.
LORELAI: But you don't look so healthy now. Now you look...
LUKE: Unhealthy.
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: Ok.
LORELAI: Oh what? So I said you look good. We're not in 5th grade. You look good', big deal. Stop staring at me.
[patient passes by]
LUKE: Ah, jeez.
LORELAI: See that's what you get for being cocky.
[Grandpa wheeled out]
LORELAI: Uh, how is he?
ORDERLY: He's a little groggy right now.
LORELAI: What's going on? How are the tests?
ORDERLY: The doctor will have to tell you that, I'm just the transport guy.
LORELAI: When is the doctor coming out?
ORDERLY: I'm not sure but you can go in with your dad until he gets here.
LORELAI: Thanks.
LUKE: Go ahead, I'm good.
LORELAI: That's ok, uh, I'm gonna go find my mom and Rory and tell them he's back up.
LUKE: I can tell them when they get here.
LORELAI: That's ok, uh, I think they'd like to know now [turns around and almost knocks over her mom] Ah!
EMILY: Lorelai, you almost ran me over.
LORELAI: Well, good thing we're in a hospital.
EMILY: Where were you going?
LORELAI: To find you, they just brought dad up.
EMILY: When?
LORELAI: Just now.
EMILY: Well how is he? Did you talk to him?
LORELAI: No not yet, I was coming to find you.
EMILY: Well come on.
LORELAI: You go ahead mom, I'm gonna go find Rory.
EMILY: Fine. [goes into room]
LORELAI: Ok.
LUKE: You know I could look for Rory.
LORELAI: No that's ok, I'll do it.
LUKE: I thought so. Hey look, it's Rory. [Rory comes up to them]
RORY: The coffee machine was jammed so I got us some chicken soup and some Pez.
LORELAI: I was just coming to look for you.
RORY: Why, is everything ok?
LORELAI: They just brought Grandpa back up. He's in room 202.
RORY: Well come on.
LORELAI: You go ahead, I just - I have to make a call.
RORY: Well hurry up.
LORELAI: I'll meet you there.
LUKE: So who are you gonna go find now?
LORELAI: Stop.
LUKE: How about Jimmy Hoffa? That'll keep you busy for a while.
LORELAI: I said stop.
LUKE: You can't avoid going into that room forever.
LORELAI: I'm not avoiding anything. I'm going to find coffee.
LUKE: The machine's jammed.
LORELAI: Well there are other machines.
LUKE: Admit you're afraid.
LORELAI: You have no idea what you're talking about.
LUKE: The truth hurts.
LORELAI: No you know what hurts? Having a screwdriver jammed in the side of your head [pointing behind Luke]
LUKE: What? [turns around] Oh my God!
CUT TO INSIDE HOSPITAL ROOM
RORY: Year end optimism in recent earnings reports, have pushed shares of the telecommunications giant about $65'.
RICHARD: [weakly] Oh, rubbish.
RORY: However, some experts say that the stock is dangerously overvalued.'
RICHARD: Ahh. Hmm.
EMILY: [Comes into room] Well how are we doing?
RORY: We're done the front page of the Financial Times and all of The Wall Street Journal.
EMILY: Very good progress. Rory dear, why don't you save the rest of the paper till later hmm?
RORY: Ok. [to Grandpa] If I hug you, is it gonna hurt?
RICHARD: Pain is part of life. [she hugs him]
EMILY: This little girl likes you.
RICHARD: Well, she has good taste.
[Pan to Rory coming out of room and finds Luke sitting in the chairs beside the room]
RORY: Where's mom?
LUKE: Looking for coffee.
RORY: What are you doing?
LUKE: Staring at my shoes.
RORY: Ok, carry on.
[Pan back inside room]
EMILY: Well I finally found you some decent pillows, they're not down but at least they give a little.
RICHARD: Emily, we need to talk.
EMILY: Can you life your head at all?
RICHARD: This is serious.
EMILY: Just a little.
RICHARD: There is a key in my top desk drawer.
EMILY: Better yes?
RICHARD: It is to the safe.
EMILY: One more time.
RICHARD: All of our stock information is in there, plus all of the insurance information.
EMILY: Now if I could just find you some different sheets.
RICHARD: Our will is in my lower left drawer, Denis has a copy in case there's a problem.
EMILY: Maybe I could get Dava to bring some from home -
RICHARD: Emily, this is serious. We have to be practical.
EMILY: I'm gonna have Dava get those -
RICHARD: Emily listen to me, if I die -
EMILY: No!
RICHARD: Emily.
EMILY: Richard Gilmore, there may be many things happening in this hospital tonight but your dying is not one of them.
RICHARD: But -
EMILY: No! I did not sign on to your dying. And it is not going to happen. Not tonight, not for a very long time. In fact, I demand to go first. Do I make myself clear?
RICHARD: Yes Emily. You may go first.
EMILY: Good. I'm gonna get you those sheets. [picks up the phone as Richard takes her hand and holds it.]
[Pan to Lorelai and Rory by the coffee machine.]
RORY: No luck?
LORELAI: I think I'm wearing it down.
RORY: You're pathetic.
LORELAI: Is the doctor back?
RORY: Not yet.
LORELAI: So, you have a visitor tonight.
RORY: Yeah? Who?
LORELAI: Narcolepsy boy.
RORY: Dean came over?
LORELAI: Oh yeah. He pulled the old tapping on the window' bit.
RORY: Were you mean?
LORELAI: Excuse me, I am never mean.
RORY: You were mean.
LORELAI: He told me nothing happened.
RORY: Nothing did.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: You do? Really?
LORELAI: Rory, there are only two things that I totally trust in this entire world. The fact that I will never be able to understand what Charo is saying no matter how long she lives in this country - and you.
RORY: Hopefully not in that order.
LORELAI: You just have to understand the major panic factor that went on there.
RORY: I do, I really do and I'm so sorry. Nothing like that will ever happen again. I swear.
LORELAI: Don't swear.
RORY: Why not?
LORELAI: Because you are your mother's daughter.
RORY: What does that mean.
LORELAI: It means things can happen, even when you don't really mean for them to happen.
RORY: They will not happen.
LORELAI: Hmm. Ok
RORY: I hated going to that party tonight without you.
LORELAI: I hated you going to that party tonight without me. How were the apple tarts?
RORY: Oh, Grandma didn't make them this year.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Yup.
LORELAI: That's weird.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: Hmm, are you lying?
RORY: Through my teeth.
LORELAI: Good girl.
[pan to outside Grandpa's room]
EMILY: Oh, hello [sees Luke sitting there.]
LUKE: Hi.
EMILY: If you don't mind, I think I need to just -
LUKE: Oh sure. Sit, please. How is he?
EMILY: Oh you know he's - I don't know. [playing with Grandpa's tie]
LUKE: It's a nice tie.
EMILY: It's Brooks Brothers.
LUKE: Ah.
EMILY: It was bothering him tonight. I told him not to loosen it. I wanted him to look nice for our guests, so he didn't. And then well...The paramedics took it off him on the way here. I just haven't been able to put it down yet [sniffles] I must sound crazy.
LUKE: I've kept my father's entire store just the way he left it.
EMILY: Really?
LUKE: Well I turned it into a diner, but I kept all his stuff on the walls, his pictures in the office, even the Hardware' sign.
EMILY: I'm sure he would've appreciated having his life's worked being honored like that.
LUKE: He would've called me a damn fool.
EMILY: Oh, well. I don't know what Lorelai's told you about her father, I can certainly imagine, but he's a very good man. He always did the right thing for his family.
LUKE: That's what she told me.
EMILY: So what exactly is going on between the two of you?
LUKE: Nothing. Really. We're friends, that's it.
EMILY: You're idiots, the both of you.
[Lorelai and Rory come back]
EMILY: There you are, where have you been?
LORELAI: Coffee hunt. So what's going on?
LUKE: Your mother called me an idiot.
LORELAI: Wow, you must have sucked up good.
EMILY: Well I'm going to go wash my face [leaves taking Rory with her.]
[Lorelai stands in front of the door to Grandpa's room.]
LUKE: So whatcha gonna do?
LORELAI: [sighs] Ok, well, I'm just gonna...
LUKE: I'll be here.
[Lorelai looks at Grandpa who opens his eyes. They look at each other for a couple of seconds and are about to say something when the doctor, Rory and Grandma walk into the room.]
EMILY: ...I've heard for such a long time. Richard, how are you darling?
JOSHUA: Well Richard, it looks like we're gonna be stuck with you for a while longer. It was just a touch of angina.
EMILY: But you have to watch your diet.
JOSHUA: Yes, that's going to be very important. No more red meat, heavy desserts and you're going to have to exercise regularly.
EMILY: Golf doesn't count.
RORY: So can he go home?
JOSHUA: We'd like to keep him over night though, just to be sure.
RORY: But he's fine.
JOSHUA: As long as he does what he's told, yes. [Lorelai sneaks out]
[Luke comes around the corner]
LUKE: I heard, everything's ok.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. They're going to keep him over night but - but he's going to be fine. [cries]
LUKE: Hey. [Luke hugs her] Ok, see here's where the guy is supposed to give the girl his handkerchief but I don't have one...and plus I find the practice a little revolting so...
LORELAI: No, I'm ok.
LUKE: You sure?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: Alright. Oh hey, I got this for you.
LORELAI: Ah, where'd you get that?
LUKE: Nurse's lounge.
LORELAI: Uh-huh.
LUKE: What? You're not the only one who can flirt [Lorelai laughs] The door was open.
LORELAI: Thank you.
LUKE: Anything else I can do?
LORELAI: Could you take Rory home?
LUKE: Yeah sure. What about you?
LORELAI: I'm gonna stick around here for a while and make sure everything's are settled you know. You take her and I'll drive the jeep back.
LUKE: Ok. [Rory comes out]
RORY: He's gonna be fine.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah. I think it was those financial papers that really did the trick. [they giggle] So, um, Luke's gonna take you home ok, I'm gonna hang out here for a while.
RORY: I'll stay too.
LUKE: No, go, call Dean. Talk mushy to each other and then spend an hour arguing over who's going to hang up first.
RORY: You are gross.
LORELAI: I'll call you later.
RORY: Ok, well tell him good bye for me. And tell Grandpa I'll come back tomorrow.
LORELAI: Ok, I will, bye.
RORY: Bye.
LUKE: Ok, walk fast and look straight ahead.
[Grandma and Joshua come out, Joshua leaves]
EMILY: He's almost asleep.
LORELAI: Good.
EMILY: Where's Rory?
LORELAI: I sent her home with Luke.
EMILY: What about you?
LORELAI: I thought I'd stick around in case anybody needed anything.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: I mean not you. You obviously don't need anything, but somebody somewhere in this hospital might at some point need something and I'm gonna be the person who gets it for them.
EMILY: Would you like to go down to the cafeteria for something to eat?
LORELAI: Yes. Maybe somebody in the cafeteria will need something.
EMILY: Oh dear.
LORELAI: And won't they feel lucky when they see me. Hey I needed something and there you were', it's going to be a great moment.
CUT TO LUKE'S
LORELAI: Hello.
LUKE: Hey, how's your dad?
LORELAI: Better, though he says that life is not life unless it includes a steak. How come you're not out with everybody?
LUKE: I had some things to do.
LORELAI: Right, anyways, this is for you. [giving him a bag]
LUKE: What's it for?
LORELAI: Just thank you, Christmas, whatever.
LUKE: Christmas isn't for two weeks.
LORELAI: Do we really have to do this again? [he opens the present. It's a baseball hat] I just thought, you know, God forbid something happens to that one, you might need a spare. Here [put it on forwards] Does that look wrong. [puts in on backwards] There! Oh hey turn out the lights [going to the window]
LUKE: For what? It's not the real procession, it's just the rehearsal.
LORELAI: So, it's pretty.
LUKE: And why do they need to rehearse it? It's the same thing every year.
LORELAI: Come on Luke, please. [he turns out the lights and joins her by the window] It's hard to imagine living somewhere else isn't it?
LUKE: Thanks for the hat.
LORELAI: You're welcome. Looks good on you.
LUKE: Good how?
LORELAI: Just watch the procession.

1.11 - Paris is Burning
written by Joan Binder Weiss
directed by David Petrarca
(Lorelai and Rory are walking down the street)
RORY: L?
LORELAI: L-laryngitis. M?
RORY: Mumps. N?
LORELAI: Narcolepsy! O?
RORY: Are we going to have to go through this every time we decide who cleans out the refrigerator?
LORELAI: Do you want to go back to thumb wrestling?
RORY: Osteoporosis. P?
LORELAI: (gasps) Puppies! (runs across the street)
RORY: That's not a disease. Oh boy. (runs after her)
LORELAI: (to all the puppies) Hi! Oh hi! Hi! Oohh! Rory look at the baby! (in front of one)
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Aw, Buttercup was found cold and wet hovering under a hydrangea bush along highway 26. It's a sad highway.
RORY: As compare to all the other happy highways she could've been abandoned by.
LORELAI: Her lineage includes cocker spaniel, golden retriever, bouvier des flandres -
RORY: Gesundheith
LORELAI: Thank you - and rottweiler.
RORY: Buttercup is a special dog. She's extremely skiddish and tends to react badly towards blonde haired females, brunette males, children of either sex, other animals, red clothing, cabbage or anyone in a uniform.
(Luke walks up to them)
LORELAI: (to Luke) Hey, we just found the doggy version of you.
MAN: Can I help you?
LUKE: Do not let these two anywhere near a dog. They can barely feed themselves.
LORELAI: Shut up you! We'd be excellent pet owners, thank you.
RORY: You cannot be serious.
LORELAI: We could get him a pretty bowl...
RORY: It's a her.
LORELAI: ...and a new name...
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: ..cause this 'Buttercup' thing really has got to go.
RORY: Do I need to remind you of Skippy?
LUKE: Skippy?
LORELAI: I can't believe you would bring up Skippy.
RORY: Skippy was our hamster.
LORELAI: He doesn't care.
LUKE: What happened to Skippy?
LORELAI: Nothing happened to Skippy.
RORY: Every time mom would put her hand in his cage, he'd bit her.
LORELAI: And laugh.
LUKE: Hamster's can't laugh.
LORELAI: Oh this one laughed - trust me.
RORY: So finally she got fed up.
LUKE: Of being laughed at by a hamster?
LORELAI: Well yeah.
RORY: So she stopped cleaning it's cage. Instead everyday she would stuff some Kleenex in there.
LUKE: You didn't?
LORELAI: It was the quilted kind (with a small smile)
RORY: So this keeps going on and the cage is just a cage full of Kleenex that moves a little, and the smell? Really good.
LUKE: I can imagine.
LORELAI: Oh no you can't
RORY: So then she takes the cage to the place where we bought him, waits for the sales guy to go behind the desk and dumps it on the counter then bolts.
LUKE: You abandoned your hamster.
LORELAI: Look, I know it was bad, but this was a vicious hamster. This was like a Damien hamster with little beady eyes and a big forked tail and...a cape with a...hood...and bye bye Buttercup. Bye Luke.
RORY: You did the right thing. (both walking away from the puppies with arms around each other)
LORELAI: Oh (in a whiny tone). I want a pet.
RORY: You have me.
LORELAI: You won't bring me my slippers in the morning.
RORY: I might if you had slippers.
LORELAI: Will you wear a collar?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: It'll be pink!
RORY: You're sick.
LORELAI: Hey watch how you talk to me. Remember what happened to Skippy.
(Cut to Max Medina's apartment. He's cleaning while Lorelai sits on the counter eating out of a pot.)
LORELAI: Mmm...God this is good!
MAX: OK. Correct me if I'm wrong.
LORELAI: Salt please.
MAX: Twenty minutes ago we were sitting at the dinner table were we not?
LORELAI: Yes we were.
MAX: There were candles and flowers and plates and knifes and cloth napkins.
LORELAI: I love the little sombrero napkin holders, very ole.
MAX: And the whole time we were at said dinner table, you ate two maybe three bites of this amazing dinner I made for you.
LORELAI: Pass the bread.
MAX: And yet, as soon as that dinner's over and I start cleaning up, suddenly that's when you're starving.
LORELAI: What can I say - watching someone work makes me hungry. If I hadn't stopped watching "This Old House" I'd be 500 lbs right now.
MAX: Hmm.
LORELAI: What are you doing?
MAX: Passing these to you?
LORELAI: In the dish please. Ha ha ha. (as Max puts food into pot.)
LORELAI: So where did you learn to make osso bucco anyway?
MAX: Um, from this very old Italian woman...who used to live upstairs...um, s-she had lost her husband a couple of years before and she kinda looked at me as like a son.
LORELAI: Sweet!
MAX: She was.
LORELAI: So an old girlfriend huh?
MAX: Yep.
LORELAI: Mm hm.
MAX: So would you like some coffee?
LORELAI: Yes please. (Walks by Max and their faces come very close together)
(Lorelai walks over to his desk)
LORELAI: Hey did you read Rory's paper yet?
MAX: Not yet.
LORELAI: It's really good.
MAX: I'm sure it is.
LORELAI: Oh and look! It's right on top.
MAX: Isn't that a coincidence?
LORELAI: (laughs) Wow, there are some really big words in here. I just hope you have a dictionary with you when you read it.
MAX: Oh I will.
LORELAI: You know I could just save you the time and uh, put an 'A' on it for you.
MAX: Well that really wouldn't be fair to the other students who's mothers aren't here tonight would it?
LORELAI: Yes you're right. (pause) Although, life isn't fair and the sooner those kids learn that the better.
MAX: Well I'll take that advise into account.
LORELAI: (giggles). (turns around to look at his books) Wow these are beautiful!. Hm, I never read Proust, I always wanted to. Every now and then, I'm seized with an overwhelming urge to say something like "As Marcel Proust would say.." but of course I have no idea what Marcel Proust would say so I don't even go there. I could do, uh, "As Micheal Crichton would say.." but it's not exactly the same you know.
MAX: Well, take it.
LORELAI: Oh no! It-it looks so valuable
MAX: It's a book. It's meant to be read.
LORELAI: You sure?
MAX: Take it, read it.
LORELAI: Ok, I will.
(She takes the book and sits down and starts to read)
MAX: (laughing) Not now!
LORELAI: What?
MAX: I'd rather you didn't read it now.
LORELAI: But um, what about (Max kisses her) my required reading (stands up, moving towards the bedroom, between kissing..) But I won't make the cheerleading squad! (kissing) Mr. Medina, is this my extra credit work because Missy just had to take a test!?! (laughing through kisses. Door closes.)
(Cut to Lorelai sneaking in with shoes in hand)
(Rory's waiting up on the couch)
RORY: Where do you think you're going?
LORELAI: Hi.
RORY: It's one o'clock in the morning.
LORELAI: I know but my watch stopped during a terrible car wreck and I had to save kittens and small children and four baby chicks.
RORY: Did you have a nice time?
LORELAI: Not bad. (smiling)
RORY: That's a very big smile for a not bad night. (Lorelai sits on the couch)
LORELAI: Yeah well...Hey he loaned me a book.
RORY: What book?
LORELAI: 'Swann's Way'
RORY: Aren't we ambitious.
LORELAI: Yes we are.
RORY: You know what it means when a man loans you a book don't you?
LORELAI: That he's already read it?
RORY: Yep.
LORELAI: (laughs a little) How was your night?
RORY: Homework.
LORELAI: How many times did Dean call.
RORY: Not that many.
LORELAI: How many?
RORY: Three (Lorelai looks at her)...Five.
LORELAI: (laughs) Not an all time high but very respectable. I'm going to bed. You staying here?
RORY: Yeah. I'm comfortable. I've got the pillows in a perfect mushed position.
LORELAI: Ok. Night mom. (kissing Rory)
RORY: Yeah you just go think about what you've done.
LORELAI: (with big smile) I will.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: You look happy.
LORELAI: I am kid.
RORY: Just checking.
(Cut to Chilton - Mr. Medina's class)
MAX: "There's a certain slant of light, winter afternoons that oppresses like the heft of cathedral tunes." That, my friends is the first verse of a poem by Emily Dickenson. Now read some of those tonight, and as you do, consider the fact that Emily Dickenson writes convincingly about passion and about the world in spite of the fact that she lived as a virtual recluse. It'll help you appreciate her mind. (bell rings)
MADELINE: I could listen to him talk about passion all day. Do you think he's dating anyone?
LOUISE: Of course he is.
MADELINE: A teacher?
LOUISE: Please.
MADELINE: Why not?
LOUISE: Have you seen teachers?
MADELINE: He's a teacher.
LOUISE: Male teachers are different. They can still be mysterious.
MADELINE: I bet his girlfriend's pretty.
LOUISE: I bet she's dumb.
MADELINE: Why?
LOUISE: Dumb girls crave smart men. It's that whole Marilyn Monroe - Arthur Miller syndrome.
MADELINE: I still think she's lucky
PARIS: Whoever he's dating is a loser, who doesn't care that he's a teacher in this ridiculous school making a ridiculous teacher's salary. (to Rory) What are you looking at? (walks away)
LOUISE: Guess someone read the paper today.
MADELINE: I know. Paris' parent's divorce is getting very ugly!
LOUISE: Her dad should've just paid her mom everything she wanted and this whole thing would've been over.
MADELINE: That's what my dad did. (to Rory) Hi!
LOUISE: Hi.
RORY: Hey.
MADELINE: Is it true Paris' mom had the entire back of her body surgically reconstructed?
LOUISE: Well it doesn't match the front now does it?
(Cut to Grandma's house)
(Dinner time)
GRANDMA: How's the squab?
RORY: It's good.
GRANDMA: Lorelai?
LORELAI: It's the best tiny, weird bird I have ever eaten.
GRANDMA: I'm glad.
LORELAI: Why are you smiling like that?
GRANDMA: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: You're smiling.
GRANDMA: I'm happy.
LORELAI: That's not your "I'm happy" smile.
GRANDMA: Well what smile is it Loerlai?
LORELAI: That's your "I've got something on Lorelai" smile.
GRANDMA: Rory your mother must be very tired.
RORY: She works a lot.
LORELAI: I grew up with that smile - I know that smile.
GRANDMA: Tell me about school.
RORY: Well, my French final went pretty well.
LORELAI: You can change the subject. I know the smile.
GRANDMA: Whatever you say dear.
LORELAI: I've used it a few times myself.
RORY: Mom.
GRANDMA: So tell me about parent's day?
LORELAI: What?
GRANDMA: Parent's day? Next Wednesday? When all the parents are supposed to go to the classes with their children all day long?
LORELAI: The Chilton newsletter came out today!
RORY: Yup.
LORELAI: Right.
GRANDMA: You didn't read yours?
LORELAI: Not yet.
GRANDMA: Ah.
LORELAI: But you knew that -
GRANDMA: Well -
LORELAI: Hence the smile.
GRANDMA: Lorelai, you're really being silly. There's no evil plan a foot here. I simply brought up a subject I thought we could all talk about.
LORELAI: Oh right.
GRANDMA: I'll try another subject - the colour blue is very pleasant isn't it?
LORELAI: Mom not everybody can wait outside the mailbox for the Chilton newsletter to arrive and then instantly memorize the contents in three seconds.
RORY: I'd like to weigh in on the blue colour subject please.
GRANDMA: You have your priorities far be it from me to question them.
LORELAI: Just because I don't read the newsletter doesn't mean I don't care about my daughter.
GRANDMA: So are you going?
LORELAI: To what?
GRANDMA: To parent's day!
LORELAI: Why don't we talk about it next Friday when I've actually read the newsletter. I guarantee it'll be more fun.
GRANDMA: We could except for the fact that parents day is next Wednesday.
LORELAI: Wednesday?
RORY: Yup.
GRANDMA: If we talked about it on Friday then you would've missed it.
LORELAI: Wednesday huh?
RORY: It's ok mom, you don't have to be there.
GRANDMA: I guess we can talk about how you missed it.
LORELAI: I'm won't miss it.
RORY: Mom it's not a big deal, you're busy.
GRANDMA: You know what - I'll go!
LORELAI: What?
GRANDMA: Why not? You have to work. I, as you have insinuated, have no life, therefore I will go sit with Rory at parent's day.
LORELAI: I'm not busy, I'm going. I will be there - that's it. End of story ok?
GRANDMA: Fine.
LORELAI: Fine.
GRANDMA: So did you read on page two about the mother/daughter talent show?
(Lorelai chokes on her food)
RORY: You ok? (smiling)
(Cut to Gilmore house)
RORY: Mom I have to go! It's almost 8 o'clock!
(Lorelai running around her room getting ready)
LORELAI: Wait! Have you seen my orange suede clip thingy?
RORY: Top right hand drawer.
LORELAI: It's not there.
(Rory huffs and goes upstairs to help)
RORY: Did you check in your purse?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: Under your scarves?
LORELAI: Yes.
(at the bedroom door)
RORY: In your sock drawer?
(Lorelai looks in the sock drawer and finds it.)
LORELAI: (gasps) I love you.
RORY: I'm gone.
LORELAI: Bye (give Rory a kiss)
LORELAI: Hey wait!
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Blue disco sequence bag?
RORY: No!
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Bad.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Bye.
LORELAI: Bye! (pause) Wait-wait-wait!
RORY: Mom come on! Mr. Medina's going to be here any minute!
LORELAI: Ok, just tell me one more thing. Where's the silver dangly bracelet?
RORY: I'm wearing it.
LORELAI: Why are you wearing it?
RORY: Because it's mine.
LORELAI: Oh...right...Hey can I borrow your silver dangly bracelet?
RORY: I'll leave it on the table for you.
LORELAI: Thank you.
(Rory heads for the door and the doorbell rings)
LORELAI: What was that?
RORY: The door bell rang?
LORELAI: Why did the door bell ring?
RORY: Because someone's at the door.
(Lorelai comes down the stairs while Max listens from outside.)
LORELAI: It's 8 o'clock. Who shows up at 8 o'clock for an 8 o'clock date?
RORY: I don't know, maybe a Chilton teacher?
LORELAI: Everybody knows that 8 o'clock means 8:20, 8:15 tops!
RORY: Well obviously he was raised in a barn.
LORELAI: I tell you, he's cute but this punctuality thing has knocked 10 points off the dream guy quotient.
RORY: Mom what do I do? I'm not even supposed to be here.
LORELAI: Ok so go!
(Rory turns to leave)
LORELAI: Oh wa-wa-wait! You have to get the door.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Yeah, because I'm not ready.
RORY: I'm not supposed to get the door remember, we agreed. I don't get the door when you have a date.
LORELAI: I know but...
RORY: I'm not even supposed to be here. That's the first rule of the 'Gilmore Dating Handbook'. (as Lorelai fiddle with her skirt zipper). Daughter shall be nowhere near house when said man materializes. It's a good rule, it 's been working.
LORELAI: Ok, but he's standing out there and it's cold and my slip is now completely stuck in my skirt zipper and they'll have to bury me like this.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: Just this once! (as she runs upstairs)
(Rory opens the door)
RORY: Hi.
MAX: Rory.
RORY: Come on in.
MAX: Thank you (clears his throat)
RORY: Can I get you something, I mean we don't really have anything but if you wanted something and we had it, I'd be happy to get it for you.
MAX: I'm fine.
RORY: We have water.
MAX: That's ok.
RORY: It's not bad water actually. I mean it's not a funny colour or anything.
MAX: I'm good. Really.
RORY: We have bottled water.
MAX: No thanks,
RORY: One bottle actually.
MAX: I-it's quite alright.
RORY: We really need to go to the store.
MAX: So..should we...
RORY: Sit? Right. Yeah let's sit.
(They move into living room)
MAX: So, uh, what are your plans tonight?
RORY: I'm going over to my friend Lane's house.
MAX: Sounds good.
RORY: And you guys are...?
MAX: Dinner, movie - the usual.
RORY: Right.
(Both look upstairs. Max clears his throat.)
MAX: This is a little uncomfortable.
RORY: Yes it is.
MAX: But the thing is, if things go well, the way I hope they're going, then we might be doing this again.
RORY: Sitting uncomfortably?
MAX: (laughs) Seeing each other outside of school.
RORY: That's ok. I am fine with this whole you and my mom thing.
MAX: Well good. I'm glad.
RORY: Well, better go. (gets up to leave)
MAX: It's good to talk to you Rory. (standing up)
RORY: You too Mr. Medina. (She turns to leave)
MAX: why don't you call me Max? Just when we're out of school.
RORY: (turning back) I don't think I can do that.
MAX: Why not?
RORY: It just sounds wrong - disrespectful. I mean, you're my teacher Mr. Medina, and if I start to think of you as a 'Max' - even as a part-time 'Max', it just seems lit it would get too confusing.
MAX: How 'bout then, we'll come up with non-Chilton names for each other. When we're not in school, I'll call you Rebecca.
RORY: Rebecca.
MAX: And you'll call me...
RORY: Norman?
MAX: Norman?
RORY: Well...
MAX: I look like a Norman to you?
RORY: I'm sorry, 'Psycho' was on earlier and it was just the first name that came to mind. I'll think of something else. How about Alfred?
MAX: You know what...Norman's fine.
RORY: Are you sure?
MAX: I'm positive, I love it. I might make a legal change.
RORY: Ok. Well I better go.
MAX: I hope you and Lane have a good time.
RORY: Thanks. Oh, would you give this to my mom for me?
MAX: Absolutely.
RORY: Thanks.
(Rory starts to leave.)
RORY: Oh and Norman - have her home by 10.
(Max waves her off)
(Cut to Luke's)
(Rory's sitting at the counter as Sookie and Jackson enter)
SOOKIE: I can't believe you won't just sell them to me.
JACKSON: And I can't believe you're being so small minded.
SOOKIE: My stuffed fried squash blossoms are extremely popular with the customers.
JACKSON: Yes I know.
SOOKIE: People come from all over and demand the fried stuffed squash blossoms.
JACKSON: That's exactly my point!
SOOKIE: What'll you have sir? Anything that comes with the stuffed fried squash blossoms. That's what I hear day in and day out.
JACKSON: Yes, great, I know, but all I'm asking you is to try stuffing something a little different this time huh? (holds up a zucchini tush)
SOOKIE: A zucchini tush?
JACKSON: Just a temporary name.
SOOKIE: You want me to serve my customers a genetically engineered vegetable that's named after a butt?
JACKSON: Hey this is an all natural vegetable hybrid that's perfectly safe, completely delicious, and yes it looks a little odd but you can put in on the map!
SOOKIE: I want the blossoms.
JACKSON: Fine. You wanna think small, think small. I'm done. (leaves)
(Sookie sighs and sits next to Rory)
RORY: Jackson invented a new vegetable again?
SOOKIE: Yup.
RORY: It's too bad that bowling league didn't work out for him.
SOOKIE: Yeah.
(Lorelai enters with skates over her shoulder)
LORELAI: Hey, look I found them.
RORY: Where?
LORELAI: They were in that drawer with the roasting pans.
RORY: Cool.
SOOKIE: Oooh skates!
LORELAI: Rory and I have a skating date.
RORY: I'm Nancy Kerrigan.
LORELAI: And I'm Tonya Harding. I'm gonna do the whole shoe lace coming untie - nervous break - let me start again act and everything.
LUKE: (laughing) When was the last time you put those things on?
LORELAI: Oh, you are constantly trying to ruin my fun.
LUKE: Do they even fit anymore?
LORELAI: Yes they fit.
LUKE: They look rusted.
LORELAI: Well...can I just have some coffee please?
LUKE: (sighs) Hand them over.
LORELAI: Why?
LUKE: I'm gonna clean them and tighten the blades.
LORELAI: Really!?!
LUKE: Yes.
LORELAI: Can you make them really shiny?
LUKE: The skates please.
LORELAI: Maybe add a couple of pompoms.
LUKE: Just hand them over.
LORELAI: Thank you!
SOOKIE: You get really good service here.
LORELAI: Yeah I do.
(Sookie's pager goes off.)
SOOKIE: Gotta go.
LORELAI: Anything wrong?
SOOKIE: Too much yeast, too little bowl.
LORELAI: Enough said.
LORELAI: (to Rory) So I think I'm just going to go for it and wear the fur-trimmed skating skirt, pride be damned.
RORY: Hey, what if we invite Max to go skating with us?
LORELAI: M-max?
RORY: Yeah, I thought maybe he'd want to go.
LORELAI: When did you start calling him Max?
RORY: Well the other night he said that I should probably call him something other than Mr. Medina when we're outside of school. Which makes sense, so I'm getting used to saying 'Max'.
LORELAI: W- you don't see him that much outside school.
RORY: No, but I probably will since you guys are obsessed with each other.
LORELAI: Yeah, well I wouldn't say 'obsessed'.
RORY: No. It's ok, I mean of all the guys to have hanging around, he seems like a good choice. I like him.
LORELAI: Good, well that's good.
RORY: So what do you think about the skating?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Mr. Medina - I'm sorry, Max? Do you think he'd wanna go?
LORELAI: I don't thin he skates. (to Luke) Thanks.
RORY: Well maybe we could all do something else together.
LORELAI: Yeah, good. Something else is good. I love something else.
(Cut to Gilmore house)
(Kettle whistles.)
SOOKIE: Ok, tea is ready. How are the feet?
LORELAI: I don't know. They stopped talking to me.
SOOKIE: What on earth were you thinking?
LORELAI: That I could still skate.
SOOKIE: It's not like riding a bike you know.
LORELAI: Now you tell me.
SOOKIE: So, (sitting at table) what are you up to tonight.
LORELAI: Well, I'm going to do a little line dancing, then run a 10K, then just jump up and down really hard for about an hour.
SOOKIE: No Max?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Taking a night off?
LORELAI: I don't seem him every night Sookie.
SOOKIE: He seems like a great guy.
LORELAI: He is.
SOOKIE: That didn't sound very convincing.
LORELAI: No, he is. He is a great guy - for someone.
SOOKIE: For someone?
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: Someone else?
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: Someone else who is not you although you're the person spending every waking hour with him.
LORELAI: Right.
SOOKIE: Aha. How long have you been dating?
LORELAI: Why?
SOOKIE: Two months you've been seeing him right?
LORELAI: Point Sookie?
SOOKIE: Mmm. Just right on schedule that's all.
LORELAI: I have no idea what you're talking about.
SOOKIE: This is about the time you start doing you little getaway dance. Two months right on the nose - you're good.
LORELAI: I do not do a dance.
SOOKIE: You're cha-cha-cha-ing right now.
LORELAI: I'm not cha-cha-cha-ing. I'm being practical. Rory is starting to get attached to Max and that's not good.
SOOKIE: Oh Rory's getting attached to Max?
LORELAI: Yes and since I've decided that Max is probably not the guy for me, I think it's better that we break it off before she gets hurt.
SOOKIE: Practical
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: Uh, can I say something here?
LORELAI: Of course you can.
SOOKIE: Cha-cha-cha.
LORELAI: Stop that.
SOOKIE: (singing) Livin' la vida loca.
LORELAI: Sookie.
SOOKIE: Shake your bon-bon, shake your bon-bon.
LORELAI: Hey, you will not stand there singing Ricky Martin songs to me. This is not a pattern ok? I'm not doing what I always do. This is not the same.
SOOKIE: Actually you're right. Usually you don't get so upset and defensive during the cha-cha talk.
LORELAI: (painfully) Ah! (as Sookie pours hot water into foot basin)
SOOKIE: You must really like this guy.
LORELAI: When did you become the relationship expert? You haven't been in a relationship in years. (Sookie looks sad as Lorelai realizes what she said). Wow! Zero to jackass in 3.2 seconds.
SOOKIE: That's alright, your feet hurt.
LORELAI: No it isn't. It's never ever ok for me to talk to you like that. I'm so so sorry. Please honey.
SOOKIE: (sighs) I understand - really. You know it's not like I don't want a relationship.
LORELAI: I know. I didn't mean anything by it.
SOOKIE: (sighs) It's just - it's hard with my hours. I'm always at the inn, or at the market or at the hospital.
LORELAI: Please - forgive me. Do you wanna...sing some more Ricky Martin to me?
SOOKIE: No.
LORELAI: You can you know - I deserver it.
SOOKIE: (quietly) 'She's into superstition, black cats and voodoo dolls. (louder) I've got a premonition, that girl's gonna make me fall.' (imitates guitar tunes)
(Cut to Chilton)
TRISTIN: You know I heard that Paris' dad's actually got a second family in Paris.
GUY: Whoa.
TRISTIN: Yeah.
(Rory rolls her eyes as she walks by.)
MAX: Uh, Rory?
RORY: Hey Mr. Medina.
MAX: I enjoyed your paper on Dickenson.
RORY: I had fun writing it.
MAX: It showed.
RORY: Thanks.
MAX: You're welcome (Rory turns to go) Um, Rory?
(Rory turns back)
RORY: Yeah?
MAX: No, that's it. That's all I wanted to say.
RORY: My name?
MAX: Yes.
RORY: Ok.
MAX: Actually I just wanted to see if Lore- (looks around) if your mom is coming to parent's day.
RORY: Oh well...
MAX: Cause I'm just trying to get an accurate number of parents who are coming - you know for the cookie count.
(Rory smiles at him)
MAX: Forget it. (sighing)
RORY: She's coming.
MAX: (relieved) I hadn't heard from her for a while about it and -
RORY: She'll be here.
MAX: Ok, good. Good.
RORY: But you should put us down for four.
MAX: Four what?
RORY: Four cookies.
MAX: Ok, good. I will.
RORY: Bye.
(Max sighs)



(Cut to Gilmore house)
(Lorelai is cleaning out the fridge.)
LORELAI: Four slices pepperoni pizza.
RORY: From?
LORELAI: Tuesday?
RORY: Last Tuesday?
LORELAI: The Tuesday in the not so distant past.
RORY: Toss it. (sits at table) So you remember Paris Geller.
LORELAI: Your very best friend in the whole world?
RORY: Her parents are getting a major divorce.
LORELAI: Really.
RORY: Her dad's like this big wig at a huge pharmaceutical company and they're printing all the sordid details about it in the paper.
LORELAI: Ooh how sordid?
RORY: Well, it's not the Rich James incident, but Hugh Grant should be feeling pretty good about himself.
LORELAI: If she was anyone else in the entire universe I might feel bad for her.
RORY: Actually I kind of do feel bad for her.
LORELAI: That's because you are the nicest kid ever to walk the earth.
RORY: The whole school's talking about it. And the weird thing is that the whole dynamics there has changed for me.
LORELAI: Really? How so? (gets up to go towards fridge)
RORY: Well, Madeline and Louise, Paris' best friends, they said hello to me the other day.
(Both munching on cold fries)
LORELAI: Really? Like a normal hello? Not like a 'Here's Johnny' kind of hello?
RORY: Normal, friendly, no acts.
LORELAI: Wow, you're the new 'Heather'
RORY: I guess.
(Lorelai pulls out another pizza box)
LORELAI: Oh, hey, this is the pizza from mystery Tuesday. That one's completely fine (pointing to the one in the garbage bin.)
RORY: Don't.
LORELAI: It's in the box!
RORY: Oscar!
LORELAI: Felix!
RORY: Forget it!
LORELAI: Fine.
(Rory goes back to table.)
RORY: So how's 'Swann's Way' coming.
LORELAI: Oh finished.
RORY: You're kidding! It took me forever to read that. I had to renew it 10 times.
LORELAI: The first sentence - I finished the first sentence.
RORY: Aha.
LORELAI: Yeah - it's just - I'm so swamped right now you know, it's the totally wrong time to start reading the longest book known to man. Hey maybe you could give it back to Max for me?
RORY: Just bring it with you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Tomorrow?
RORY: Parent's day?
LORELAI: I know (she didn't) I'm just - I'm not sure I'm going to be able to make it.
RORY: What do you mean?
LORELAI: Well I have that thing at the inn and I thought I could get away and now I can't.
RORY: What thing?
LORELAI: The thing - the inn thing?
RORY: What inn thing?
LORELAI: You know.
RORY: No I don't.
LORELAI: The thing at the inn with the flags and the little men and the peanuts - the thing.
RORY: Little men?
LORELAI: Forget it, it's not important - I just don't think I can go.
RORY: Ok, fine.
LORELAI: So, if you could give this book back to Max tomorrow - that would be great.
RORY: Why don't you just give it back to him the next time you see him.
LORELAI: Because I'm not sure when that would be and he should have his book. (getting a bit upset)
RORY: You see him all the time.
LORELAI: Rory, could you just (drops book on table) give it back to him ok?
RORY: Are you breaking up with him?
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
RORY: Well he hasn't heard from you and now you're asking me to give him the book back.
LORELAI: How do you know he hasn't heard from me?
RORY: He wanted to know if you were going to Parent's day and then he mentioned that you guys hadn't talked lately.
LORELAI: He shouldn't be asking you about me.
RORY: Why are you breaking up with him?
LORELAI: Because it's not working out.
RORY: But you seemed so happy.
LORELAI: It's not right - that's all.
RORY: So that's why you're not going tomorrow?
LORELAI: No, I'm not going tomorrow because of the thing at the inn.
RORY: That's crap and you know it (upset)
LORELAI: Hey -
RORY: There is no thing at the inn, you're avoiding Mr. Medina and you're trying to lie to me and you promised you would go and - hey, do whatever you want. I don't care, just leave me out of it. And give him the book back yourself. (Rory goes to her room and slams the door.)
LORELAI: Fine I will. (takes the pizza out of garbage.)
(Cut to Chilton)
LORELAI: Hey, not so fast.
RORY: The bell's gonna ring.
LORELAI: Before you go one more step - tell me you like me?
RORY: You bug me.
LORELAI: I'll take that as a yes. And I want you to know that I will deal with my issues with Max myself.
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Really.
RORY: I believe you.
LORELAI: So where are we going?
RORY: To my locker to drop off some of this stuff.
LORELAI: Great, let's do it.
(see Paris and her mother by Paris' locker arguing)
PARIS: You can't just leave now.
MOM: Paris please.
PARIS: At least come to my lit class.
MOM: This place is giving me a headache.
PARIS: Mom.
MOM: Is your face breaking out?
PARIS: No.
MOM: You have not being using that cleanser have you? Now Dr. Yanalari prescribed that cleanser for a reason - to cleanse.
PARIS: Just lit class.
MOM: Paris with everything I have going on right now the last thing I need to do is face a bunch of bored people who are gossiping about me. I'll see you later at home. Use that cover stick I got you.
(Paris sighs)
LORELAI: I bet I'm looking pretty good to you right now.
RORY: Yes you are.
LORELAI: Hmm. So what's first? Wait don't tell me.
RORY: English lit with Mr. Max Medina.
LORELAI: Ok see I told you not to tell me.
RORY: Sorry
LORELAI: Mr. Medina's class huh?
RORY: The fancy book owner himself.
LORELAI: How does first annual mother/daughter ditch day sound?
RORY: Not happening.
LORELAI: Yeah yeah, ok - let's go.
(Cut to Mr. Medina's class)
MAX: On Monday we will start a two week of creative writing exercise, but that doesn't mean we stop reading. One of the greatest inspirations of working writers is the writing of other that they admire. Walt Whitman read Homer, Dante, Shakespeare. And the novelist Edna O'Brien has been quoted as saying 'that every writer should read some Proust every day' Now, at this point, normally I would impress the partens by pulling out a copy of Proust's 'Swann's Way' and reading a particularly difficult passage but alas, you're all saved. I have misplaced my copy. (bell rings) Oh that does is - parent's thanks for coming, students - papers on Whitman are due tomorrow and those of you who are just starting tonight - I'll be able to tell.
LORELAI: So you go on ahead ok? I'm going to talk to Max for a second.
RORY: Please be nice.
LORELAI: I will, I will.
LORELAI: (to Max) Hi.
MAX: Hi - it's nice to see you.
LORELAI: Yeah. I've been really busy.
MAX: Oh sure - I assumed.
LORELAI: I wanted to give this back to you.
MAX: Keep it.
LORELAI: I really liked it. I like the first 20 pages anyway, then I got busy and I can see you really need it so - (tries to give him the book)
MAX: What's going on Lorelai?
LORELAI: Nothing. I just don't think a book whose first sentence is 20 pages long is for me.
MAX: Well I left four messages
LORELAI: I know - I've been meaning to call.
MAX: What's been keeping you?
LORELAI: I don't know - things.
MAX: Uh huh.
LORELAI: Sorry.
MAX: Sorry?
LORELAI: That I didn't call.
MAX: Ok.
LORELAI: So - here. (tries to give him book again)
MAX: Why do you keep on trying to give me the book?
LORELAI: Because it's yours.
MAX: Is there something going on here that I don't know about?
LORELAI: Yeah, uh I hate Proust.
MAX: Lorelai?
LORELAI: Look, um Rory's out there waiting for me so... (tries to give him book again)
MAX: Wa-wait a minute...Oh my God! I cannot believe what an idiot I am.
LORELAI: What?
MAX: You're breaking up with me aren't you?
LORELAI: I don't know.
MAX: Not only are you breaking up with me, you're doing it really badly.
LORELAI: Am I being graded?
MAX: No, I'm a little disappointed. I would've expected a better dumping from you.
LORELAI: Nobody's dumping anyone.
MAX: Really? Then what is this?
LORELAI: I just need space.
MAX: Well I don't. In fact I want as little space as possible. 100 clowns crammed into a Volkswagen. That's the kind of non-space I'm talking about.
LORELAI: It's not working.
MAX: It was working pretty good the other night.
LORELAI: Look it is what I've been trying to tell you all along. This is a family. Rory and I, you walked into a family, but you weren't listening and now she's getting attached and I'm afraid she's gonna get hurt.
MAX: So you solution to all of this is not to return my calls
LORELAI: It just took me a while to figure things out and it all came clear when I realized how much we could hurt Rory.
MAX: Don't you mean how much we could hurt Lorelai?
LORELAI: Hey - I can take care of myself.
MAX: I don't understand this. I thought we went through this. W-we decided she could handle it.
LORELAI: Well maybe she can and maybe she can't. I'm not ready to find out.
MAX: I'm not going to let you off that easily.
LORELAI: Well there's nothing you can do about it.
MAX: There has to be.
LORELAI: There isn't.
MAX: There is.
LORELAI: Well no there isn't.
MAX: Yes there is.
LORELAI: What are we in high school? Well I know we are in a high school.
MAX: This is so not you.
LORELAI: Well, you don't know everything about me.
MAX: I guess not, because I would've thought that blaming this all on Rory and giving me these lame apologies was weak, pathetic and beneath you.
LORELAI: Just take you damn book
MAX: You've missed me.
LORELAI: Stop it.
MAX: I know you did, you're missing me right now aren't you?
(Lorelai sighs)
MAX: Answer me.
LORELAI: Look class is over -
MAX: Well we're back in session.
LORELAI: Well I didn't raise my hand so don't call on me! I came here to give you this book back, please take it.
MAX: I swear to God if you try to give me that book one more time...
(They kiss passionately. Outside the class Paris walks by and sees them kiss)
(Cut to cafeteria)
(Gets noisier and noisier as Paris walks from table to table talking to people. Tristin walks by Rory and makes a 'kiss' sound to her. Paris walks up to Rory.)
RORY: What's going on?
PARIS: Oh, everyone's just talking about the mom that Mr. Medina was seen kissing just now.
RORY: What?
PARIS: And the weird thing is - she looks a lot like your mom.
RORY: What are you talking about?
PARIS: Your mom - Mr. Medina, mouths open. I saw them. How's the coleslaw? Good? (walks away)
(Lorelai walks into cafeteria)
LORELAI: Hey, did you save me some jello?
(Rory gets up and leaves)
LORELAI: What? (follows Rory out) Rory?! Hey where are you gong?
RORY: Were you kissing him?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Mr. Medina, just now, were you kissing him?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: What the hell is wrong with you?
LORELAI: I don't know.
RORY: You said you were breaking up with him.
LORELAI: I was.
RORY: I know I told you to be nice to him but this was a little extreme don't you think?
LORELAI: It wasn't supposed to happen.
RORY: Paris saw you! It's all over the school!
LORELAI: Oh God - oh Rory, I'm so sorry. I really am. See this is exactly why I didn't want to date him.
RORY: You didn't want to date him so you wouldn't come to my school and kiss him and humiliate me?
LORELAI: Yes that's exactly it.
RORY: Why would you do this?
LORELAI: Because I'm human, because I screwed up. I'm sorry.
RORY: If you like him so much then why are you breaking up with him?
LORELAI: Look, I broke the rules when I brought him into our lives and I realize now that that was a very bad idea.
RORY: But why?
LORELAI: Why?! Because we are standing in this stairwell yelling at each other that's why! Because it's affecting you, it's seeping into your life and that is the whole reason I made these rules in the first place. Is-is to protect you!
RORY: You know what, maybe it was a good idea that you hid your personal life from me when I was a kid but I'm not a kid anymore.
LORELAI: No, you're right. You're a 40 year old divorcee - my mistake.
RORY: Ugh! I can't believe you're blaming this on me!
LORELAI: I'm not blaming you!
RORY: You made up these stupid rules years ago about the way the Gilmore women would run their lives and now you're sticking to them even though they're crazy!
LORELAI: Oh hey my crazy, stupid rules are the reason we're doing so good in our lives. They're the reason you grew up the way you did, the reason you're even in this school and the reason you're going to go to Harvard so don't you dismiss my rules.
RORY: Fine! Great! Well, maybe it's time for the rules to change!
LORELAI: Yes, well that's for me to figure out, not you!
RORY: Great! Fine! Well could you figure it out before French class because I'd rather you didn't start making out with Mrs. Collins.
LORELAI: Hey no promises until I see what she looks like!
(Cut to front of Grandma's house)
LORELAI: Look, let's just refrain from fighting in front of the grandmother ok?
RORY: Fine with me.
LORELAI: The last thing I need tonight is a confrontation with my mother
(rings doorbell)
LORELAI: Hi mom, boy the roads were a mess out there tonight. (entering)
GRANDMA: Rory go upstairs please.
RORY: Is everything ok?
GRANDMA: I have to talk to your mother, please go upstairs.
RORY: Well -
GRANDMA: Now Rory.
GRANDMA: (walks into living room) Lorelai come here!
LORELAI: Gee mom, did I do something wrong?
GRANDMA: I try to understand you, I truly do. But sometimes your behaviour baffles me beyond belief.
LORELAI: And which behaviour is this?
GRANDMA: Do you have no shame?
LORELAI: Is that intended as a rhetorical question or - ?
GRANDMA: Rory goes to school in that place, she has a reputation to protect. You're her mother.
LORELAI: How did you -
GRANDMA: You're supposed to shield her from shame not cause it.
LORELAI: Oh mom?
GRANDMA: Kissing a teacher...in a classroom...on parent's day!
LORELAI: Well...they wanted us to get more involved with the school.
GRANDMA: Are you insane?
LORELAI: No but you are if you think I'm discussing this with you.
GRANDMA: When I heard I almost fainted.
LORELAI: How did you hear mom?
GRANDMA: I have friends Lorelai. Headmaster Charleston's wife for one.
LORELAI: Oh, that's great.
GRANDMA: The entire school is talking about it. And what do I say, how do I defend this?
LORELAI: It was a mistake.
GRANDMA: A mistake? A mistake? Is that what you call it a mistake?
LORELAI: Well I tried to call it 'Al' but it would only answer to 'mistake'.
GRANDMA: A mistake is when you throw out your credit card bill - a mistake is when you forget to RSVP to a dinner party - a mistake is when the gardeners miss trash day and the barrels are full for a week. This my girl, was not a mistake! Do you even know this man?
LORELAI: Ah, no, this is the first time I'd seen him and I don't know, there was just something about the way he held the chalk and -
GRANDMA: This is not the time for your jokes.
LORELAI: Yes I knew him. I've been dating him.
GRANDMA: Why on earth would you date Rory's teacher?
LORELAI: That's none of your business.
GRANDMA: It most certainly is.
LORELAI: How do you figure that?
GRANDMA: When it affects my granddaughter it becomes my business.
LORELAI: I don't want to talk about this with you!
GRANDMA: I just want to know what you were thinking. What was the reasoning? How on earth did you justify it to yourself?
LORELAI: Max is a great guy. An amazing guy! He's smart, he's sweet (teary) he cooks.
GRANDMA: So you decided to kiss him in your daughter's school.
LORELAI: No, I decided to breakup with him in my daughter's school and the kissing part just happened.
GRANDMA: You always let your emotions get in the way. That's the problem with you Lorelai - you don't think.
LORELAI: Mom - please.
GRANDMA: He's just a man Lorelai.
LORELAI: No he's not.
GRANDMA: Oh so what are you telling me. That this was all worth it because he was the love of you life, that this was the man for you.
LORELAI: I don't know. He might have been. Excuse me (leaves room)
(Cut to Chilton cafeteria)
(Rory sitting at a table. Paris, Louise and Madeline walk up behind her.)
LOUISE: See, I told you he wouldn't date a teacher.
PARIS: I wish my mom would sleep with my teacher, it would make midterms a lot easier.
(Rory slams her book closed, stands up and turns to face them)
RORY: Madeline, Louise, would you excuse us for a minute?
LOUISE: Ooh cat fight.
RORY: Go.
PARIS: You're not going to kiss me are you? (smiling)
RORY: What's wrong with you?
PARIS: Nothing I'm great.
RORY: You've just spent the past two weeks with all of your family's private problems printed in the newspaper for everyone to read and talk about. I saw how you walked around here! I saw how much you hated it. And then you turn around and pull something like this? Doesn't that seem crazy to you? Do you have any idea how many people you've hurt? Forget me and my mom, what about Mr. Medina? He likes you, he encourages you. He hold up your papers and tells the class how great you are. And then you turn around and spread stories about him. (pause). Whatever, forget it. You have no idea what I'm talking about. (grabs her stuff and starts to leave)
PARIS: I do like Mr. Medina.
RORY: Well I'd take some dance lessons cause the way you express yourself needs a little work.
PARIS: I...probably shouldn't have told people what I saw.
RORY: No you shouldn't have.
PARIS: I'm sorry...things have been...well...not good lately.
RORY: I know.
PARIS: I just didn't want them talking about me anymore, that's all.
RORY: Well, it worked.
PARIS: Yeah.
RORY: You know, i-if you want to talk -
PARIS: Hey, we are not friends.
RORY: Oh that I know. But if you ever do...want to talk about -
PARIS: I will, if I want to.
RORY: Ok.
PARIS: But I probably won't.
RORY: That's fine.
PARIS: But if I do -
RORY: I'm around.
PARIS: Ok. I'm going now.
RORY: Bye.
PARIS: Bye. (Paris starts to leave and turns around)
PARIS: I doubt I will.
RORY: I'm not holding my breath. (sighs and leaves)
(Cut to Independence Inn kitchen)
(Jackson drops a box of squash blossoms on the counter)
JACKSON: There - squash blossoms. All large enough for you to stuff and fry up and serve to the desensitize masses who just want what they know. Hurrah! Mediocrity wins again!
SOOKIE: Jackson?
JACKSON: You know what, I'm not even gonna charge you for these. I am not going to profit off the death of creativity. I would rather starve myself than know that my food was paid for by the lowered expectations of the American public. (starts to leave)
SOOKIE: Jackson?
JACKSON: What?!
SOOKIE: Would you like to go to dinner sometimes...with me?
JACKSON: Ok.
SOOKIE: Ok.
(Jackson leaves, Sookie's smiling.)
(Cut to coffee shop in Hartford)
(Max sitting at the counter)
MAX: Thanks (to waiter)
(Lorelai walks in)
LORELAI: Hey Mister, wanna buy a really nice copy of Proust?
MAX: How ya doing?
LORELAI: Hmm. Well you know. You?
MAX: Well you know it also.
(Lorelai sits)
LORELAI: So that parent's day is fun.
MAX: Oh, it was a big hit this year (both laugh a little)
LORELAI: Look, the other day, we were going skating, and Rory said "Why don't we invite Max to come along with us" and that was a little weird for me.
MAX: Me too. I don't skate.
LORELAI: She's never really referred to anyone I've dated by their first name before. I always kept her out of that part of my life, so it was like "the mustache guy", "the earring guy", "the peg leg guy".
MAX: Oh so you have a thing for pirates.
LORELAI: She never called anyone by their name before. She likes you. She likes us. So my mind instantly went to "Oh my God, what if we break up, she'll be crushed" and then my next thought was "Oh my God, what if we break up, I'll be crushed". And then as you know all hell broke loose.
MAX: I understand.
LORELAI: I freaked out. I'm so sorry. I never meant to treat you like that, I'm not very good at this, ask Skippy.
MAX: Skippy?
LORELAI: (shaking her head) I'm so so sorry.
MAX: I was called into headmaster Charleston's office today.
LORELAI: Let me guess. He put his arm around you and said "I don't understand why you crazy kids can't work this out?"
MAX: He said that I was jeopardizing my career and future at Chilton.
LORELAI: Oh!
MAX: At first I was incensed, outraged and "How dare he?!". And then I realized that he was right. What happened the other day was completely unprofessional. I never in my life would've considered pulling off something like this. He should've fired me.
LORELAI: But he didn't.
MAX: Not yet, but the word 'probation' was tossed around quite a bit though.
LORELAI: I'm sorry.
MAX: I'm the one that started the kiss.
LORELAI: And I'm the one that knocked it up to NC-17.
MAX: I honestly did not think that this was going to be so complicated.
LORELAI: I know.
MAX: I mean you told it would be. I didn't listen, I didn't want to.
LORELAI: It's not your fault. If I hadn't acted like a two year old and tried to run away and pretend that you weren't what you are to me, then we wouldn't have fought, we wouldn't have kissed, I wouldn't have humiliated my daughter and the whole thing would've been fine.
MAX: (sighs) I do not know what to do here. I-I've never been in a relationship like this before. I'm not thinking straight.
LORELAI: I know, me either.
MAX: That was a great kiss.
LORELAI: Beyond great.
MAX: Maybe we need to take a little time away from each other.
LORELAI: Ok. (upset)
MAX: You know, just to figure out how to do this so it's not so hard.
LORELAI: Sure...that makes sense.
MAX: I just - I don't have any other answers right now.
LORELAI: No you're right. You're absolutely right. (pause) I really really like you Max Medina
MAX: I really really like you Lorelai Gilmore.
LORELAI: Well, as long as we got that straightened out.
MAX: Goodbye Lorelai (gets up and leaves)
LORELAI: (whispers) Bye.
(Cut to Gilmore house)
(Rory comes home)
RORY: Mom! Mom, I'm home!
(Goes upstairs)
RORY: Mom?
(Finds Lorelai laying on her bed crying. Rory strokes her hair in comfort and lays down with her and hugs her.)

CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
[alarm rings]
RORY: Mom!
[Lorelai comes into the kitchen, takes the coffee pot off the maker while Rory puts her coffee cup in it's place to catch the coffee that's still in the process of being made. Rory puts two pop tarts in the toaster, takes her coffee cup from the coffee maker while Lorelai replaces it with the pot. Lorelai puts the pop tarts on a paper towel while Rory picks up her school bag. Lorelai hands Rory a pop tart and with coffee and pop tart in hand, tries to tie her shirt. Rory hands her her coffee, puts the tart in her mouth and ties it for Lorelai. Lorelai takes the clip out of Rory's hair, gives her a 'what were you thinking' look and tosses it aside. Rory takes her coffee back and they both leave.]
CUT TO GILMORE LIVING ROOM
[Rory and Lane are sitting on the couch]
RORY: Wow, you went new-cd crazy! [dumping a bag full of cd's on the coffee table]
LANE: They just had an amazing selection today.
RORY: The best of Blondie...Kraftwerk...Young Marble Giants...Yoko Ono - really?
LANE: A very misunderstood artist and the b*at would've broken up anyways.
RORY: Have you shared this theory with anyone?
LANE: I know it, Yoko knows it, Sean knows it. Julian's still in denial but what can you do?
RORY: Ok, I must listen to anyone named Claudine Longet [puts cd in player]
LANE: Rory...
RORY: Yes Lane?
LANE: I have a favor to ask you.
RORY: Uh huh?
LANE: Well you know Dean?
RORY: My boyfriend?
LANE: Yes.
RORY: Yes I do.
LANE: Ok...well remember I was telling you about his friend Todd?
RORY: Todd. Yes.
LANE: Have you met him?
RORY: No.
LANE: Well he's cool.
RORY: Good.
LANE: Really cool.
RORY: Good again.
LANE: Really, really cool.
RORY: Good still holds.
LANE: So cool in fact that it brings me to the next question [Lorelai comes into living room]
LORELAI: Hey. I'm studying in there...
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: Yeah. I have like 6,000 pages of case studies to memorize and this whole big test on the Wal-Mart phenomena coming up on Friday and because I have a life and a job and business school's not the only thing I have to concentrate on I'm behind, and I'll probably fail and then that little 18 year old annoying knat who sits behind me will get another A' and make that  I'm smart you're dumb' fact to me for the rest of the week and I'll be very upset and will possibly cry.
RORY: The music's too loud.
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: Got it.
LORELAI: Thank you [Lorelai turns and goes back into the kitchen as Rory turns down the volume.]
LANE: So anyhow, I was wondering if you could talk to Dean about maybe talking to Todd about me.
RORY: I guess.
LANE: And then maybe you could ask Dean to ask him out - for me.
RORY: Good, cause I don't think Dean would want to go out with Todd. Might screw up their friendship.
LANE: And then I was thinking that this date could maybe happen this weekend.
RORY: Huh.
LANE: Sunday preferably.
RORY: Well -
LANE: After church.
RORY: Lane -
LANE: But don't mention church.
RORY: Ok, hold on a sec -
LANE: Unless he's into church.
[Lorelai comes into the living room again]
LORELAI: Hey, uh, now it's too quiet.
RORY: I'll turn it up.
LORELAI: Thank you [starts to leave]
RORY: Ok.
LANE: So what do you think?
LORELAI: [turning back] Who the hell is that anyways?
RORY: Claudine Longet.
LORELAI: The chick who sh*t the skier?
RORY: Uh, sure, why not.
LORELAI: Wow - renaissance woman [turns and leaves]
RORY: [to Lane] You want me to set you up with Todd?
LANE: Yes and I was thinking that you and Dean could come out with us so that it's not that big of a deal.
RORY: Oh.
LANE: You don't want to do it?
RORY: No I -
LANE: That's ok, I understand - no big deal. Hey Grand Daddy new album used - I love a bargain.
RORY: I just really don't know this Todd guy.
LANE: I do.
RORY: You've met him twice
LANE: But the 3rd time's a charm
RORY: How do you know this guy's right for you?
LANE: I know, I'm telling you. We're talking soul mate here.
RORY: The last time you met you soul mate, you ran your fingers through his hair and ended up hiding at my house for the evening.
LANE: Well I still have my key.
RORY: Lane?
LANE: Look, I made a mistake with Rich Bloomenfeld. Everybody's allowed one mistake. But Todd, Todd is different.
RORY: He is?
LANE: First of all his name is Todd - Different name different guy [Lorelai come back into living room]
LORELAI: Ok so, [turning off music] how important is this whole business school thing anyway? I mean, so what if I never run my own inn? I like my job, I like my house, I like my life. And I certainly don't want to be one of those people who's never satisfied with what they have you know? I mean some people don't have legs or arms. I have legs and arms. What more could I possibly want than legs and arms? I mean, I could take all the classes in the world, that's still not going to give me what I already have.
RORY: Legs and arms.
LORELAI: Yes. [pause] Am I sounding completely crazy?
RORY: Yes you are.
LORELAI: Wal-Mart is boring!
RORY: Study!
LORELAI: Aah! [leaves]
LANE: So?
RORY: So?
LANE: Rory?
RORY: Ok.
LANE: Really?
RORY: Yes, Yoko [they hug]
LORELAI: So [she comes and sits between the two and taps their legs] Whatcha doing?
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
[Lorelai is sitting at front desk studying. Michel comes up to her and stares at her]
LORELAI: Yes Michel?
MICHEL: I apologize for any inconvenience I might be causing your future employment but your current one is experiencing a problem.
LORELAI: And once again I say 'Yes Michel?'
MICHEL: Are you sure you wouldn't like me to wait?
LORELAI: No Michel.
MICHEL: Because learning the eating patterns of the average Taco Bell consumer is a vital lesson that -
LORELAI: Michel. What do you want?
MICHEL: We are overbooked.
LORELAI: How are we overbooked?
MICHEL: Well there are more people here than there are rooms to put them in.
LORELAI: I don't understand this.
MICHEL: Well I cannot describe it any simpler than I already have.
LORELAI: Well where did the Rucker's come from?
MICHEL: Well judging from their clothing a town where high rubber fishing boots and spittoons would be considered formal wear.
LORELAI: Ok, put them in the Jefferson suite tonight, move them back to their previously booked room tomorrow and offer them dinner on the house for the inconvenience.
MICHEL: Very well.
LORELAI: I'm gonna get some more coffee if you need me.
MICHEL: I'll try and manage while you're gone, though God knows it won't be easy.
LORELAI: (entering kitchen) Coffee?
SOOKIE: Yes.
LORELAI: Great.
SOOKIE: Necesito las hojas grandes.
LORELAI: Oh! Meringue.
SOOKIE: Yeah, I thought I'd do a variation on a baked Alaska for dessert tonight.
LORELAI: What kind of variation?
SOOKIE: See I hadn't thought of that yet.
LORELAI: Maybe you could do them in the actual shape of Alaska.
SOOKIE: Interesting.
LORELAI: Or you could do little baked Alaskas and Hawaiis
SOOKIE: Because they joined the union last.
LORELAI: Exactly.
[Sookie giggles]
JACKSON: Oh [coming in the door]
SOOKIE: Jackson.
JACKSON: Sookie - hello.
SOOKIE: Hello.
LORELAI: Hey.
JACKSON: I brought you um -
SOOKIE: [stuttering] Yeah, well great. Just put them down there.
[Lorelai watching the exchange]
JACKSON: Right. Oh, yes [puts carrots on the counter] How's that?
SOOKIE: That's great, that's just perfect. I really like them there.
JACKSON: Yeah they - they do look good there don't they?
SOOKIE: Yes they do.
JACKSON: Ok. Well I should - [turns to leave]
SOOKIE: Uh, squash.
JACKSON: What?
SOOKIE: I need some.
JACKSON: Squash.
SOOKIE: Pattypan
JACKSON: Ok, tomorrow?
SOOKIE: Same time?
JACKSON: If that's good for you?
SOOKIE: It is, it's perfect.
JACKSON: Ok then, I-I'll see you tomorrow with the pattypan.
SOOKIE: Great.
JACKSON: Yes. [leaves]
[Sookie rolls her eyes]
LORELAI: Ok so...who walked in on who naked?
SOOKIE: Oh God this is horrible! He comes in and - horrible.
LORELAI: What's going on between you two?
SOOKIE: I asked him if he'd like to have dinner sometime.
LORELAI: I know - weeks ago.
SOOKIE: And he said yes.
LORELAI: Which is good.
SOOKIE: But since there's not definite plan or date attached, now the invitation is just out there floating in the universe.
LORELAI: So make a definite plan.
SOOKIE: I can't.
LORELAI: Why?
SOOKIE: Because what if he says no?
LORELAI: He already said yes.
SOOKIE: Yes to the amorphous, theoretical, 'Let's maybe sometime go out and do something not too specific' proposition. But dinner and a movie - it's concrete. It's real, he might say no.
LORELAI: I doubt he will.
SOOKIE: Well why hasn't he asked me?
LORELAI: I don't know, maybe he thinks you've changed your mind since you asked.
SOOKIE: Well why would he think that?
LORELAI: Because you haven't mentioned it again.
SOOKIE: But I mentioned it once, it's his turn.
LORELAI: Alright, let's say it is his turn, you can spend a lot of time sitting around waiting for him to realize it's his turn, or you can just run with the wolves and make it your turn again.
SOOKIE: I don't want it to be my turn again.
LORELAI: You just wanna let this opportunity pass?
SOOKIE: I wanna be the girl.
LORELAI: You are the girl. That's why we're having this very confusing conversation.
SOOKIE: You think I should ask him out?
LORELAI: On Sunday.
SOOKIE: Why Sunday?
LORELAI: Because that's your day off.
SOOKIE: Ok.
LORELAI: Now.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: I think you should do it now before you lose your nerve.
SOOKIE: Well he's not back to his office yet.
LORELAI: Does he have a cell phone?
SOOKIE: Yes.
LORELAI: You know people buy cell phones for exactly this reason - so you could get a hold of them anytime you want.
SOOKIE: I thought people bought cell phones in case their cars broke down at night and they needed to call someone for help and there's psycho k*ll -
LORELAI: Call him.
SOOKIE: Call him?
LORELAI: Call him Sookie.
SOOKIE: Call him [giggles]
[They go over to the phone]
LORELAI: Mmm, she knows his number by heart.
SOOKIE: He is my produce guy.
LORELAI: Very convenient excuse.
SOOKIE: He - [into the phone] Oh Jackson? It's Sookie. [picks up a wooden spoon and plays with it in her hair] I was wondering if you could call me back when you get a chance, sooner rather than later, it's not an emergency so don't freak out or anything. The carrots still look good. It seems like it's almost a shame to eat them, sort of like you should put them in a vase or -
LORELAI: [whispers] Sookie, hang up. Hang up.
SOOKIE: Call me, bye. [giggles] Got his voice mail.
LORELAI: Ok good. It give you time to prepare what you're going to say. Maybe have a few suggestions ready of places to go.
SOOKIE: Date prep time.
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: Ok good. I'm good at that. I'm good at prep. [picks up a pad of paper]
LORELAI: Sookie...spoon. [takes spoon away.]
SOOKIE: Right.
CUT TO OUTSIDE STARS HOLLOW HIGH
[Rory sitting on a bench reading. Dean come out, sees her and goes and sits with her]
DEAN: Is there anything in there about me?
RORY: I don't know. You name wouldn't be Lithium would it?
DEAN: Aren't you supposed to be in school?
RORY: We had a half day today - teacher conferences. So I thought I'd come by and surprise you.
DEAN: Well you know how much I hate surprises.
RORY: Yes, I'm very sorry.
[Dean kisses her]
DEAN: That's for surprising me.
RORY: I have learned my lesson.
[Dean kisses her again. Rory stops him after a second]
RORY: I have to talk to you about something.
DEAN: Ok, I have to talk to you about something too. Come here [ kisses her again]
RORY: Ok stop.
DEAN: Sorry. [leans in to kiss her again]
RORY: No stay!
DEAN: Why?
RORY: Because I really need to talk to you about something.
DEAN: [sighs] Alright.
RORY: It's about Todd.
DEAN: What about him?
RORY: What do you think of him?
DEAN: He's my friend.
RORY: I know.
DEAN: So that would signify a positive impression.
RORY: Right. Ok. Good.
DEAN: Yes, can I kiss you now?
RORY: I'm not done yet.
DEAN: Fine. Go ahead.
RORY: Well you know Lane.
DEAN: Yeah, I do.
RORY: She likes Todd.
DEAN: Ok.
RORY: And I think that they would really hit it off.
DEAN: You - you don't even know Todd.
RORY: No but you do. And you like him - you said so.
DEAN: I did.
RORY: Ok then. There you go.
DEAN: I would - I would really like to kiss you now.
RORY: Yeah so would I.
DEAN: Ok, good. We agree [leans in for a kiss while she leans back]
RORY: I think we should set them up.
DEAN: Todd and Lane?
RORY: Yeah. We could all go out together - like to a movie or something on Sunday.
DEAN: Rory -
RORY: It would be really casual - no big deal.
DEAN: I just -
RORY: What?
DEAN: I mean, I'm just not sure that I see them together.
RORY: You don't think Todd would like Lane?
DEAN: I'm not sure.
RORY: Lane is great.
DEAN: Yeah, I know.
RORY: She's my best friend.
DEAN: Yeah, I-I know that.
RORY: Todd should be so lucky to get a girl like her.
DEAN: I didn't mean -
RORY: I mean I can't believe that you don't think that she's good enough -
DEAN: [over Rory] No, no, no -
RORY: or I don't know pretty enough.
DEAN: I didn't say anything about her not being pretty enough -
RORY: Well you did -
DEAN: Let me finish. I just don't know if he'll like her because I don't know what kind of girl he likes.
RORY: Well -
DEAN: But if you want to do this, then I'll talk to him.
RORY: You will?
DEAN: Yeah.
RORY: And you'll mention Sunday?
DEAN: I will mention Sunday.
RORY: Thank you.
DEAN: You're welcome. So...was that it?
RORY: Yeah that was it.
DEAN: Then can we...
RORY: Kissing. Right, let's go.
[they kiss]
CUT TO INN
[Lorelai still studying]
LORELAI: [slamming book] I give up.
MICHEL: That's the spirit.
LORELAI: I can't remember any of this crap.
MICHEL: Well, not everyone is cut out to be their own boss. Maybe you are more of a worker bee, a follower, a ticket ripper, or the man at the concert with the orange glow stick directing you were to park.
LORELAI: You're baiting me aren't you?
MICHEL: No, I seriously have no faith in your aptitude.
SOOKIE: [rushing up to desk] He called! He called!
LORELAI: And?
SOOKIE: Well, I did what you said. I had it all worked out and I asked him if he'd like to go to dinner at Chez Fleur on Sunday.
LORELAI: Chez Fleur very nice.
SOOKIE: Hm, thank you. He said he would love to.
LORELAI: Oh great!
SOOKIE: He said he would love to but his cousin's in town and he's staying with him for the week.
LORELAI: Oh, well then just make it next week.
SOOKIE: Yes, see that would've been a good option had I thought of it when I was on the phone, but instead - I came up with another option.
LORELAI: Which is?
SOOKIE: That we double date with his cousin Rune and you.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: Yes, ok, not as good as your option I agree. But it seemed pretty good at the time - though I wasn't standing here watching you make that face.
LORELAI: Sookie no. I hate blind dates.
SOOKIE: I know, but this isn't a blind date. This is you keeping his cousin company while I have a date with Jackson.
LORELAI: Oh God.
SOOKIE: Lorelai please. I'll be your best friend.
LORELAI: You are my best friend.
SOOKIE: And you're mine.
LORELAI: I know I am.
SOOKIE: So what are best friends for?
LORELAI: Ok.
SOOKIE: Yes?
LORELAI: Yes, I'll go.
SOOKIE: [squeals] Thank you, thank you, thank you. You will not regret this.
LORELAI: Pick another phrase.
SOOKIE: You will not have to pay
LORELAI: Much better [sighs] Oh shut up [ to Michel who's smiling. Opens up book again]
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
LORELAI: Rory?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Diva Glam.
RORY: I've got it.
LORELAI: Bring it up. [to Sookie] Hold still.
SOOKIE: Not too much.
LORELAI: No - just enough to say hey sailor'
SOOKIE: My stomach doesn't feel so great. I think I've got the flu.
LORELAI: I think you're nervous.
[Rory comes into room]
RORY: Here.
LORELAI: Thank you.
RORY: I need the sparkly hair clips
LORELAI: Ok, I'll find them in a minute.
RORY: [to Sookie] You look pretty.
LORELAI: I do?
RORY: Uh huh. [leaves]
SOOKIE: Oh thank you. [to Lorelai] I should cancel.
LORELAI: Ok, let's do you lips first.
SOOKIE: What if I'm making an idiot out of myself.
LORELAI: By going out on a date?
SOOKIE: With my produce guy.
LORELAI: You like him.
SOOKIE: But what if tonight is a disaster and them he won't sell to me anymore.
LORELAI: Oh my God, you're right.
SOOKIE: Yes, see!
LORELAI: And since all the produce in the entire world is in his possession and all the produce that will be grown in the future will be in his possession, then we will never again be able to get any produce and all our vegetarian clients will die.
SOOKIE: I'm scared.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: I like him.
LORELAI: He likes you.
SOOKIE: How do you know he's not being polite?
LORELAI: Sookie!
SOOKIE: No I mean it. [gets up and paces] It's like I cornered him and he felt trapped and he had to say yes.
LORELAI: He did not have to say yes.
SOOKIE: Oh my God. Technically I am his employer.
LORELAI: Sookie!
SOOKIE: I am, I buy his wares. His livelihood depends on my.
LORELAI: Sookie!
SOOKIE: Oh! I'm a sexual harasser
LORELAI: Well then you need some false eyelashes.
SOOKIE: This isn't funny. I am now desperate, lonely and a criminal.
LORELAI: Ok, stop talking.
SOOKIE: But -
LORELAI: No you have exhausted all your talking rights by being crazy. Sit down and listen.
[Sookie sits]
LORELAI: Tonight is a good thing. Whether you find out that you're madly in love you or you're not meant for each other, it's still a good thing. And I'll be right there. And have I done a gorgeous job on your face or what? Ooh, I'll be right back [picking up clips]
CUT TO RORY'S ROOM
[Rory and Lane getting ready]
LANE: You're sure you don't mind?
RORY: What's mine is yours.
LANE: I owe you forever.
RORY: Good to know.
LANE: Which one do you think Todd would like better? [holding up two jackets]
RORY: I don't know Todd.
LANE: I think the rhinestones.
RORY: Rhinestones it is. So what did you tell your mom?
LANE: I told her that I was going to spend the evening here with you guys.
RORY: What if she calls?
LANE: Well I mentioned that we might go and rent some videos or go out to eat which could explain any absence during her call.
RORY: Very thorough.
LANE: With my mom, you can leave nothing to chance. Especially when there is a non-korean involved who as far as I know has no medical aspirations.
LORELAI: [coming into room] Hey, sparkly clips.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Ooh, I like the rhinestones. [leaves]
RORY: And for a touch of glamour. [putting them in Lane's hair]
LANE: So what are you going to tell Lorelai?
RORY: I don't know.
LANE: She wouldn't tell my mom would she?
RORY: I don't know if she'd feel good lying to another mother. It's like this weird code thing with her.
LANE: So we don't tell her?
RORY: I'm not liking that option either.
LANE: No. We'll tell her that we're meeting Dean for a movie, and then we go to the movie and then somebody who just happens to be a friend of Dean's, just happens to be there, for the same movie and so we figure that it would be completely rude for us to not ask said person to come sit with us.
RORY: I say to hell with governor, you run directly for president.
LANE: It's not that bad.
RORY: Let's just not think about it, ok?
LANE: I really appreciate this.
RORY: I know.
LANE: How do I look?
RORY: You look too good for him.
LANE: Just what I was going for. [giggles and they leave the room]
RORY: We're going [to Lorelai]
LORELAI: Oh, where?
LANE: We're going to a movie with Dean.
LORELAI: Nothing dirty, violent or French please
RORY: Are you going to be home late?
LORELAI: Well there's a bit of doubt as to whether or not we'll ever actually get out of the house at all tonight. Sookie please!
SOOKIE: Ok! I'm here, I'm down [coming down the stairs]
LORELAI: Wow! Hey, where's your coat?
SOOKIE: It's upstairs.
LORELAI: Aren't you gonna need it?
SOOKIE: Oh well, it got caught around the thing, and then when I twisted around to get loose, and then the choking started. I'm free now.
LORELAI: Ok. I'll get you something to wear.
SOOKIE: I would appreciate that.
RORY: Bye.
LANE: Bye
SOOKIE: Bye kittens [girls leave]
LORELAI: Bye girls.
LORELAI: Huh? [with a blue shawl in hand]
SOOKIE: Oh this is beautiful.
LORELAI: It goes with the theme of the evening.
SOOKIE: This is a really nice thing you're doing for me.
LORELAI: Anytime Sookie.
SOOKIE: Last looks [Does a turn while Lorelai claps]
[knock on the door]
LORELAI: I'll get it.
[Sookie exhales]
LORELAI: Hi,
JACKSON: Hi Lorelai, sorry we're late.
LORELAI: Oh no problem. Just adds a little more primping time for the ladies.
SOOKIE: Hi Jackson
JACKSON: Sookie, hi
SOOKIE: Hi.
JACKSON: Hi.
SOOKIE: Hi.
JACKSON: Hi.
SOOKIE: Hi.
LORELAI: Ok, uh do you guys wanna come in for a minute?
JACKSON: Oh sure. [they enter] Oh, uh Lorelai, this is my cousin Rune, Rune this is Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hi, it's very nice to meet you [extends hand but Rune doesn't take it]
RUNE: Can I talk to you a minute?
JACKSON: What's the matter?
RUNE: I need a minute alone, please?
JACKSON: Excuse us. [Rune takes Jackson outside]
JACKSON: What are you doing?
RUNE: That's Lorelai?
JACKSON: Yes.
RUNE: Did you see how tall she is?
JACKSON: No, I haven't noticed actually.
RUNE: How could you not notice, she's like a basketball player.
JACKSON: Rune, she's a very nice lady!
RUNE: You know I cannot go out with anyone that tall. I mean God! I can't believe you set me up with that. What, was the bearded lady busy tonight or something?
[Sookie and Lorelai, who are listening, exchange a look]
JACKSON: It's just one night, a little dinner.
RUNE: When she came to the door it never crossed my mind that that was who I had to spend the evening with. I thought it was her East German maid or something.
JACKSON: You're being ridiculous, she's not that tall!
RUNE: She's tall enough!
JACKSON: Would you keep it down, she's gonna hear you!
RUNE: With those big ears I bet she can.
JACKSON: Hey Rune, you come into town completely unannounced, you eat all my food, you crash on my couch and I don't say a thing. The least you could do is go out for one night - make some conversation, be pleasant, who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it!
RUNE: But why can't we go out - just to the two of us.
JACKSON: Rune, please.
RUNE: [sighs] Ok.
JACKSON: Thank you [Both go back to the front door.] Ok, I think we should be going.
SOOKIE: Yes that sounds good.
[Lorelai looks at Rune, who turns away. She closes the door behind her.]
CUT TO CHEZ FLEUR
[All sitting in silence looking at the menu. Rune is staring at Lorelai, she forces a smile]
RUNE: What size shoe do you wear?
LORELAI: Uh, size 9.
RUNE: 9? Wow.
SOOKIE: I wonder if the mussels are fresh?
LORELAI: Um, well, it does say fresh mussels' on the menu.
SOOKIE: Yes, but a lot of times they say fresh' and they're not, they're frozen but they're just called fresh' because they were fresh when they were frozen. [Jackson nodding and smiling at her] Plus if they're not stored with the correct drainage they just sit around in their own excretions, with is kind of like sitting around in your own -
LORELAI: Sookie, I beg of you, do not order the fresh mussels.
SOOKIE: But if they're fresh -
LORELAI: Even if they're fresh.
JACKSON: I wonder where they get their carrots from The carrot crop this year has been really mealy.
LORELAI: [sighs] So...Rune...
RUNE: Yes?
LORELAI: What is that - Rune' ?
RUNE: What do you mean?
LORELAI: I mean, where did Rune' come from?
RUNE: I'm from out of town, I thought Jackson told you?
LORELAI: He did tell me, I meant the name Rune'. You just don't meet a lot of Runes', right? [giggles a bit]
RUNE: It was my dad's name.
LORELAI: Oh, where'd he get it?
RUNE: [annoyed] I don't know, from his parents I guess.
LORELAI: Ok, done with that topic [waiter approaches] Oh the waiter, thanks the Lord.
WAITER: What can I get you this evening?
SOOKIE: I'd like to ask about the mussels, are they fresh?
WAITER: Yes they are.
JACKSON: And where exactly are your carrots from?
WAITER: Well -
RUNE: Is there anything on this menu that isn't French?
LORELAI: I'll just have a martini and keep'em coming. [Waiter leaves] Thanks.
[Table goes back to sitting in silence]



CUT TO OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE
[Rory and Dean are in line. She's looking at Lane and Todd in line behind them.]
DEAN: What are you doing?
RORY: Nothing.
DEAN: They're fine.
RORY: I am not looking at them. I'm looking at the world around me.
DEAN: The world is fine too.
RORY: I just want to make sure they're having fun.
DEAN: They're having fun.
RORY: How do you know?
DEAN: They're not in prison or in some sort of medieval torture chamber.
RORY: Well when you measure it that way -
[Pan to Lane and Todd]
LANE: And the amazing thing is, all these girls are screaming and none of them are getting the joke. He's playing the character of a rock star. I mean Beck is a genius and all these stupid girls are screaming at him just because they're buying into the rock star image. I love Beck. I understand Beck. [looks at Todd nervously who doesn't say anything] And the Foo Fighters - Gods. I mean, have you heard the acoustic version of Everlong'? I can't even talk about it you know? Hey, you know who I've really gotten into lately? The velvet underground. Oh and Nico - she's amazing - Depressing scary German chick. I have the cd if you wanna borrow it sometime. Wh-what kind of music do you like?
TODD: I don't know - whatever.
LANE: Fugazi?
TODD: What?
LANE: The band on your shirt.
TODD: Oh. Huh, pretty cool picture.
LANE: You don't know what's on your shirt?
TODD: It's my sister's.
LANE: Oh.
[Rory looks over her shoulder intently. Lane gives her a forced smile. Dean turns Rory's face forward.]
LANE: Well what about books? Do you like books?
TODD: Mmm. [shrugging]
LANE: Magazines? [Todd's silent] What about school? What are you majoring in?
TODD: I was thinking about gym.
LANE: Gym?
TODD: If I major in gym, I only have to take 4 classes my senior year.
LANE: Oh, cool
[Pan to Rory and Dean]
RORY: Gym?
DEAN: We work on our bikes together. He's got the good tools.
CUT TO CHEZ FLEUR
[Rune yawning]
SOOKIE: [giggling] It was so funny. Oh God! Do you remember?
LORELAI: I remember.
SOOKIE: What was Rory, eight?
LORELAI: I believe she was.
SOOKIE: Oh god, that mud pie fiasco haunted me for a year! I mean, hers looked just like mine. Of course I used you know, homemade chocolate cookies, bittersweet ganache and she used well, mud. You know, but they did look damn similar. Oh.
[Rune is cutting the heads off of swans with his knife]
LORELAI: So, uh, Sookie's been experimenting with, um, different forms of baking ever since I've known her.
JACKSON: Oh, well, that's very interesting.
SOOKIE: Yeah. Hey Lorelai, remember when I decided to teach you how to make strawberry tarts [Jackson looks bored] and the entire kitchen was stained red and I had to repaint that one wall red just to make it look normal? Do you remember? Wasn't it?
LORELAI: Mmm, it was. Sookie, let's go powder our noses.
RUNE: You'll need a lot of powder.
LORELAI: We'll be right back. Come on hon.
SOOKIE: Oh, ok.
[They get up and leave. Jackson give Rune a what are you doing?' look]
LORELAI: Honey, no matter how many beers you buy me tonight, I'm not the one going home with you, so I would concentrate on the one who might.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: You haven't said a word to Jackson all night.
SOOKIE: I haven't have I?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: I know. I'm just - Oh, I'm so nervous.
LORELAI: You're nervous? You don't have some guy staring at you like he's Cher and you're the kid from Mask'.
SOOKIE: I can - I can't think of anything to say.
LORELAI: To Jackson?
SOOKIE: Yes, to Jackson.
LORELAI: Yes, cause to me tonight there's been no off' button.
SOOKIE: I-I just - ugh! This place is too fancy, my hair is too tight and this dress is all wrong. And he looks really good doesn't he?
LORELAI: Yes he does.
SOOKIE: I'm being crazy, I know I'm being crazy.
LORELAI: No. You're just putting too much pressure on this whole evening. Look, in five seconds I can take your hair down, we can go some place more casual and personally I think you're wrong about the dress.
SOOKIE: Really?
LORELAI: Yes. Come on. Let's got to Luke's. You know, have burgers, talk, relax - no pressure, no stress, unless I wind up stepping on Rune which might be fun.
SOOKIE: That would be great.
LORELAI: Ok, come on.
SOOKIE: Alright.
CUT TO BOOKSTORE
[Lane and Todd are in a theater-like seating watching the movie]
LANE: Ok, what about movies, you must have a favorite movie.
TODD: Yes I do!
LANE: Great! What is it?
TODD: Beethoven.
LANE: Beethoven? The one with the dog?
TODD: There's this scene where this little dog is running around with a huge cabbage in it's mouth. Oh man, it's classic! I sh*t my Dr. Pepper right outta my nose! I swear!
[Lane forces another smile]
CUT TO LUKE'S
[The four enter]
RUNE: [sniffs] Ew.
LORELAI: Welcome to Luke's.
JACKSON: Well this is much better.
SOOKIE: It is, isn't it?
LORELAI: Grab a seat, I'll get some menus
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey, four menus, a coffee and an anvil please.
LUKE: What's the anvil for?
LORELAI: For Rune?
LUKE: What's a Rune.
LORELAI: Please not that question again.
LUKE: Ok. [gets coffee. Lorelai sighs and looks at them sitting in silence] Here you go.
LORELAI: Mind if I hang out here a sec?
LUKE: Why? What's going on over there?
LORELAI: Sookie and Jackson are on their first date.
LUKE: Seems to be going well.
LORELAI: I think I'd wear blue to the wedding.
LUKE: Who's the other guy?
LORELAI: That's Jackson's cousin. He's my date!
LUKE: Lucky girl!
LORELAI: Yes, I think so. He is, believe it or not, even less thrilled with the match up than I am.
LUKE: You're kidding, why?
LORELAI: I'm too tall.
LUKE: [laughs] Get out.
LORELAI: I'm serious.
LUKE: Doesn't he understand how great that is? You can get all the stuff from the top shelf.
LORELAI: Exactly. That is exactly what I bring to a relationship. Explain that to him will you. [takes a sip of coffee] Mmm. Luke, that is an exceptionally good batch of coffee.
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: Hello!
LUKE: I added a little nutmeg.
LORELAI: Really?
LUKE: Yes.
LORELAI: That's very Richard Simmons of you.
LUKE: Well what can I say. Chicks dig a man with a feminine side.
LORELAI: Oh.
RUNE: Ok [standing up] I'm really bored.
JACKSON: Sit down, we're about ready to order.
RUNE: I don't wanna order, I don't wanna eat here. I wanna go.
JACKSON: Rune.
RUNE: Jackson...Look I came out with you tonight under the impression that I'd have fun. First I get stuck with her, then I get dragged to a French restaurant, then I get dragged out of a French restaurant. God knows where I am now.
LORELAI: Oh, you're at Luke's.
RUNE: I've been very patient Jackson. Sunday night's almost over, I wanna go bowling.
JACKSON: Well I -
RUNE: And I'd like you to go bowling with me.
JACKSON: Oh...well [looking at Sookie who's looking at her hands] I guess we should...[starts to stand]
SOOKIE: Don't go!
JACKSON: Really?!
SOOKIE: Yes. Stay here. We haven't really even started our date yet.
JACKSON: No we haven't. Sorry Rune, you're on your own tonight.
RUNE: Fine, I'll just see you at home then - maybe [leaves]
LORELAI: Bye Loon! [looks over at the two] Finally.
LUKE: I guess you'll only need three menus now.
LORELAI: Hey, why don't you make up three fabulous cheeseburgers and send two over there. I'll have mine here.
LUKE: First I gotta watch a man walk out on you, then I have to watch you eat alone. Nope. Too pathetic.
LORELAI: I'm not eating alone. You're here.
LUKE: I'm working.
LORELAI: Yeah but after three cheeseburgers you're done, unless you're expecting Elijah to stop by.
LUKE: Ok. Fine. [pulls out a deck of cards] 5-card draw.
LORELAI: Oh! You're on.
[Luke deals as Lorelai watches intently]
LORELAI: Mm-hm. Mm-hm [looks at her cards] Uh...huh. Give me four. [looks at them again] Aah, no four more.
LUKE: You can't have four more, those are the four I dealt you.
LORELAI: Well these don't help me and I have vowed to discard anything negative in my life - first Rune and now these four cards.
LUKE: Whatever you say [giving her another 4]
LORELAI: Ooh, much better, thank you.
LUKE: Rune knew when to run away.
LORELAI: Ha.
[Sookie and Jackson are giggling]
LORELAI: God that's nice.
LUKE: Yep.
LORELAI: The whole first date, beginning of the relationship' glow - everything is new and exciting.
LUKE: Every joke is hilarious.
LORELAI: Every little touch is incredible [touching Luke's arm]
LUKE: Mm-hm.
LORELAI: God that's a good feeling.
LUKE: It is at that.
LORELAI: I miss that.
LUKE: You'll have it again.
LORELAI: Mmm...I guess.
[Mrs Kim sees Lorelai through the window]
LUKE: You know, maybe sometime we could...
[Door slams]
MRS. KIM: Where are the girls?
LORELAI: What?
MRS. KIM: Lane said she's with you and Rory.
LORELAI: W - slow down.
MRS. KIM: I call - no answer, I think they are at the video store, I call again - no answer. I call a 3rd time - no answer!
LORELAI: You had a lot of time on your hands tonight.
MRS. KIM: I have to know where girls are.
LORELAI: They said they were going to a movie.
MRS. KIM: With who?
LORELAI: They were going to meet Dean.
MRS. KIM: A boy? [with disgust] You let them go with a boy?
LORELAI: Mrs. Kim, Dean is Rory's boyfriend.
MRS. KIM: Just because you let your daughter run around with boys doesn't mean I let mine.
LORELAI: I thought you knew.
MRS. KIM: I didn't know! They could be anywhere, they could be doing anything. Smoking, or drinking or buying drugs!
LORELAI: They're at the movies. There's no drugs there. They don't even have the real red vines.
MRS. KIM: I need to find them [leaves]
LORELAI: I'm coming with [leaves too]
CUT TO OUTSIDE BOOKSTORE
TODD: Good flick, good flick.
DEAN: Yeah not bad.
RORY: Lane, what'd you think?
LANE: Uh, I think it's really late and I should be getting home.
TODD: Really?
LANE: Yeah but it's been fun.
TODD: Oh come on. Let's go get some ice cream or something - eat it really fast, get that freezy brain thing going. It's cool.
LANE: So tempting and yet -
MRS. KIM: LANE KIM! [shouting in Korean]
LANE: My mom!
RORY: My mom!
TODD: Two moms, that's gotta be bad.
LANE: Mama, I was just about -
MRS. KIM: [shouting in Korean]
RORY: Mom, I can -
LORELAI: So not the time Rory.
MRS. KIM: You lied to me.
LANE: I'm sorry.
MRS. KIM: Get home right now! [leave]
TODD: Whoa, rough family.
DEAN: What's going on?
LORELAI: Oh bits of information were left out of the mom packets tonight.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: Ok. Mother/daughter #2 are leaving now. Say bye Rory.
RORY: [to Dean] Bye.
DEAN: I'll, uh call you later.
LORELAI: Aah.
DEAN: I'll call you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Yeah, bye Dean.
TODD: That's Rory's mom? She's a babe man!
LORELAI: [walking away] And what were you thinking?
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: You lied to me - me! What is that nonsense all about?
RORY: I shouldn't have done it. I know I shouldn't have done it.
LORELAI: Damn right you shouldn't have done it.
RORY: But Lane really wanted to go out with Todd, and of course she could tell her mother so I didn't tell you so you wouldn't have to lie for us.
LORELAI: You lied to me so I wouldn't have to lie to Mrs. Kim?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Oh my God you really are my daughter.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: I have to know where you are at all times, especially when you have my shoes on.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: This whole trust thing only works if it goes both ways kid.
RORY: I hated doing it.
LORELAI: Good.
RORY: Would you have?
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Lied for us?
LORELAI: To Mrs. Kim?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: No.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Because that lady's scary.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: I can't lie to another mother. That's breaking the code.
RORY: So then what were we supposed to do tonight?
LORELAI: Look, I know that Mrs. Kim and Robert Duvall in The Great Santini' share a striking resemblance, but she is Lane's mom. She has the right to tell Lane she can't do something, you have to respect that and I really have to respect that.
RORY: So we were in a no-win situation tonight.
LORELAI: Yep.
RORY: Great.
LORELAI: Sorry. [pause] Hey, you know the one good thing we all learned from this?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: [smiling] That I'm a babe.
CUT TO OUTSIDE LANE'S HOUSE.
[Rory climbed a tree to get to Lane's bedroom window. Knocks.]
LANE: Hey.
RORY: What's up Rapunzel?
LANE: Don't take this the wrong way, but in all my various fantasies about who might appear at this window, you never actually made the list.
RORY: So how are you? I haven't heard from you in days.
LANE: I'm ok, I guess.
RORY: I was afraid to call.
LANE: I think that's best for now.
RORY: Your mom's really mad huh?
LANE: The words convent' and Siberia' were both used several times and at least once as a combo.
RORY: I'm really sorry Lane.
LANE: It's not your fault.
RORY: I shouldn't have arranged it. I should've -
LANE: You arranged it because I asked you to and I'm really glad you did.
RORY: You are?
LANE: If you hadn't set me up with Todd, then I would still be in love with him.
RORY: Not the guy for you huh?
LANE: Not the guy for anybody who can read, write, talk or function on a basic human level.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LANE: I was so bored that night I couldn't see straight. I've been on Korean meditation weekends that have had more laughs.
RORY: He liked you though, Dean told me.
LANE: I know, he called here.
RORY: You're kidding.
LANE: I pretended to be my mother and wouldn't allow me to speak to him. Is that mean?
RORY: [giggles] I think he'll survive. He and Dean went muffler shopping today.
LANE: That's nice.
RORY: So how long before you can get out?
LANE: I don't know. Right now I have to be in the house at all times except for school and church.
RORY: She didn't give you any time frame at all?
LANE: Nope.
RORY: I miss you.
LANE: I miss you too.
RORY: Is there anything I can do?
LANE: Yeah, don't tell anyone I went out with Todd ok?
RORY: [smiling] Promise
[They hear a noise]
LANE: I gotta go.
RORY: Bye.
CUT TO INSIDE KIM HOUSEHOLD
MRS. KIM: [angrily]You break you buy!
MAN: But it was sticking out in the aisle.
MRS. KIM: You break you buy! [Lorelai comes in.]
MAN But I didn't put it in the aisle.
MRS. KIM: You have eyes yes?
MAN: Yes I have eyes?
MRS. KIM: These eyes work?
MAN Yes these eyes work.
MRS. KIM: They can make out shape, sizes and colors?
MAN: Yes they can do all that, but -
MRS. KIM: Eyes work! They see lamp in aisle, send message to brain. Lamp in aisle - move  You move. You don't break lamp.
MAN: I -
MRS. KIM: You have no eyes, not my problem, that is between you and them. You break you buy
[Man give in and give her some money]
MRS. KIM: [all smiles and sweetly] We appreciate your business. [to Lorelai] Oh, hello
LORELAI: Hi. So I was wondering if I could maybe talk to you for a minute.
MRS. KIM: I'm working.
LORELAI: Right, well this is gonna be so quick you'll be amazed.
MRS. KIM: Fine, come. [goes into another room]
LORELAI: Look, I'm really sorry about what happened the other night, uh Rory's never lied to me like that before.
MRS. KIM: That you know of.
LORELAI: Uh, no, I'm pretty sure that was the first time and it definitely was the last.
MRS. KIM: Fine.
LORELAI: Uh, so I just didn't want you to feel that you couldn't send Lane over to our house anymore, um, because you can. Believe me, those girls go nowhere without me knowing about it. In fact I was thinking of having some house arrest ankle bracelets made you know - maybe cute ones with leopard print or zebra stripes, maybe a little glitter design...
MRS. KIM: Lane won't be coming over, she will stay in our house.
LORELAI: Well, right. I was talking about later. I mean, she's not going to be grounded forever is she?
MRS. KIM: Lane lied to me and she must be punished.
LORELAI: I totally agree. But Lane is a really good kid. I don't think I've ever met a kit who respects her parents more than Lane respects you.
MRS. KIM: Lying is not showing respect.
LORELAI: Uh, she's 16. She had a crush on a boy.
MRS. KIM: Lane is not allowed to date boys unless we have approved them. She knows that, she knows our rules and she broke them. That is unacceptable.
LORELAI: Ok, yes, you're right. But teenagers sometimes slip up.
MRS. KIM: I don't care what teenagers do, I care what Lane does.
LORELAI: You know, it doesn't always work to just lock a kid up and throw away the key.
MRS. KIM: I didn't throw away the key, it's in the kitchen.
LORELAI: [taken aback] Ok, well, I was talking symbolically...but alright, I'm with you now. Look when I was a teenager, my parents tried to keep me locked up. They tried to force me to become what they had in mind, and now I'm not talking exactly about Lane here, but in my case, it really didn't work.
MRS. KIM: You blame your parents for getting pregnant.
LORELAI: No, I just think sometimes if I'd had a little more space or someone to listen to me, things might have turned out different. Now I got lucky, because having Rory - totally the best thing that could have happened. But let's be honest, I certainly don't want Rory to turn out like me.
MRS. KIM: I don't want Lane to turn out like you either.
LORELAI: Now I believe that's the first thing that you and I have ever agreed on.
MRS. KIM: I just want Lane to be safe.
LORELAI: I just want Rory to be safe. So, I'm gonna go now. Hey, I think you are doing a great job with Lane. She's a really great kid. I just wanted to put my two cents in because that's what I do, so. Bye.
[walks out of room and breaks a vase on the way out]
LORELAI: I know, you break you buy. I heard earlier. That's $35 right?
CUT TO LUKE'S
[Lorelai and Rory enter]
RORY: An A-' - I'm very impressed.
LORELAI: And annoying boy behind me?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: B+'
RORY: Loser.
LORELAI: I know, it's all very exciting. Ooh, hey did I tell you that Sookie and Jackson have another date tonight.
RORY: What is that the third one this week?
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: That's so great.
LORELAI: I know it is. Of course if she tells me the story of how Jackson cultivates his own mealworms to help fertilize his plants one more time, I'm going to Romeo and Juliet them both.
RORY: It's sweet.
LORELAI: Mealworms.
RORY: Gross, but sweet.
[Rory's pager goes off]
LORELAI: Hey, you know the rules. No pages before french fries.
RORY: Oh my God, it's Lane!
LORELAI: Oh you're kidding.
RORY: Give me your cell phone quick.
LORELAI: Where are you going? I wanna hear.
RORY: Outside.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: Because Luke hates cell phones.
LORELAI: So.
RORY: I do not want to incur the wrath of Luke.
LORELAI: Why not it's fun.
RORY: I'll be back.
LORELAI: Goody-goody. [Rory leaves]
[Outside Rory dials]
LANE: Rory?
RORY: Lane?
LANE: I'm standing in the yard! I'm standing in the yard!
RORY: Oh my God, she let you out!
LANE: I can go as far as the sign.
RORY: That's so great!
[Pan to inside]
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: I haven't seen you since the other night. Everything turn out ok?
LORELAI: Oh yeah, fine. The dating world of 16 year olds - very exciting stuff.
LUKE: I bet. [pause] Oh, uh coffee?
LORELAI: Do you have to ask?
[Luke pours]
LORELAI: You know, I had a good time the other night - with the cards.
LUKE: Oh yeah, yeah - me too.
LORELAI: Good.
LUKE: Yeah, if fact you rushed out of here before I had a chance to -
LORELAI: A chance to?
LUKE: Kick your ass in poker.
LORELAI: [laughs] You wish.
LUKE: Burger?
LORELAI: Two and fries.
LUKE: Maybe we could do it again sometime.
LORELAI: Oh yeah, well, I-I would like that.
[Rory rushes in]
RORY: Here.
LORELAI: Oh where ya going?
RORY: Lane's allowed outside for 15 minutes. I'm gonna go over and stand across the street and yell at her. [ rushes to the door]
LORELAI: Do you still want you burger?
RORY: I'll be back [ closing door]
LORELAI: Yell hi' for me.
[Looks at Luke, then drinks her coffee.]

CUT TO LORELAI'S ROOM
[Lorelai looking through her closet. Rory laying on her bed]
LORELAI: Absolutely nothing.
RORY: Oh come on.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, I'm looking but there is nothing in here.
RORY: Oh, you're kidding right?
LORELAI: No, everything in here I wear.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: I do. There's nothing to give up.
RORY: The red and black halter top?
LORELAI: Oh, no.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Uh, it's a classic.
RORY: It's got rhinestones and zebra stripes on it.
LORELAI: So?
RORY: Tassels.
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: It has tassels mom.
LORELAI: Ok, I've had this since I was 17
RORY: Ok, I'm sorry did I mention the tassels?
LORELAI: You are heartless and unsentimental.
RORY: And you are a hopeless packrat.
LORELAI: I don't understand why I have to up root my happy family of clothing anyway.
RORY: Because it's a charity rummage sale.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: That you helped organize.
LORELAI: Ok.
RORY: And volunteered to run.
LORELAI: It was very, very hot in that room that day, I was dehydrated. They could've talked me into anything.
RORY: It was your idea.
LORELAI: Ok, I am a very sick woman and that should be apparent to anyone.
RORY: Ok, get out of the way.
LORELAI: [Blocking her closet] What are you doing?
RORY: Step away from the closet please. [pushes her aside]
LORELAI: Oh! Oh, this is so unfair! Oh no, no, no. [Rory takes a section out of her closet] Not that whole chunk! Well, just - ok take that, that's ugly. Just that one...no...uh.
RORY: [walking to the dresser] Ok, now all of this goes [pointing to clothes in her arms] I want you to come over here to this dresser, open up the top drawer and take out everything that you'd be embarrassed to be wearing during a car accident. Meet me downstairs. [leaves. Over her shoulder] Move!
CUT GILMORE LIVING ROOM
RORY: Sweater?
LANE: Over here.
RORY: Jeans?
LANE: In back of you.
RORY: A big furry purple thing that could be either a hat, a toilet paper cover or some kind of dirty hand puppet.
LANE: Mystery box on the left.
[Luke enters with two bags]
LUKE: Hey.
RORY: Hey Luke.
LUKE: Where do you want these?
RORY: What do you have?
LUKE: Clothes, rags and some old pots and pans [holding up respective bag at a time]
RORY: Kitchenware can go in the kitchen and the clothes can go right over there.
LUKE: Ok. [heads for the kitchen after putting clothes down]
LORELAI: [comes down the stairs] Here Grinch.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Who wants cheese?
RORY: Are there crackers?
LORELAI: Somewhere in the state of Connecticut, yes there are crackers.
RORY: And the Gilmore house?
LORELAI: Who wants cheese?
LANE: Me please. Um, kittens in the toilet poster? [holds up poster]
RORY: Another one?
LANE: This one's signed.
LORELAI: [from the kitchen] Ah! There a man in my kitchen, somebody call the constable.
LUKE: [coming into the living room. Lorelai following] You're mom's a fruit cake.
LORELAI: Fruit cakes by the door please.
LUKE: Good bye Rory, I wish you luck - [looks at Lorelai] with everything.
RORY: I appreciate that.
LORELAI: Ok, so rummage sale's Sunday, today is Tuesday. At this rate, we are going to be sleeping in the yard by Thursday. We have got to start getting some of this stuff out of the living room.
TAYLOR: Hello?
LORELAI: Go away.
TAYLOR: I have a full set of dishes.
RORY: Come on in Taylor.
LORELAI: Oh, um, dishes in the kitchen please.
TAYLOR: Ok, but I have to explain something first.
LORELAI: Fine go ahead.
TAYLOR: The butter dish has a small chip in it.
LORELAI: Safety tip - got it.
TAYLOR: It's fine. I filed down the chip and if you place it strategically on the table, nobody will ever know.
LORELAI: Uh, Taylor, would you like to write out some sort of instruction manual to go with the dishes?
TAYLOR: Oh, could I?
LORELAI: Notepad's in the kitchen.
[Lorelai looks through bags]
LORELAI: Ooh, that's nice.
RORY: Put that back.
LORELAI: But it has rhinestones on it.
RORY: The point of this is to get crap out of here, not to trade it in for new crap.
LORELAI: Ok, are you seeing this?
RORY: Yes I am.
LORELAI: No, I don't think you are, because if you were seeing this, you would see that this obviously has Lorelai' written all over it.
RORY: Fine, we'll just get rid of it at next year's sale.
LORELAI: Thank you.
[Sookie enters]
SOOKIE: Ok, you guys are gonna love me.
LORELAI: We already love you.
SOOKIE: No, I mean you're really gonna love me.
LORELAI: We do.
SOOKIE: Trust me, you guys are gonna so love me.
LORELAI: Ok, the love is starting to fade now Sookie.
SOOKIE: I have here in my hand, as requested by Ms. Lorelai Gilmore, four fabulous tickets to the Bangles at the Pastorella theater on Saturday!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: No?
SOOKIE: Do you love me?
LORELAI: Oh baby do I!
LANE: Are these good seats? These look like good seats.
SOOKIE: 9th row, aisle.
LORELAI: I can't believe you got me my tickets! Well, how did you score these?
SOOKIE: Remember the Birnbaum wedding?
LORELAI: Fiji fantasy?
SOOKIE: Yes. They were so thrilled with the volcano wedding cake that they wanted to do something nice for me and since Mr. Birnbaum runs a ticket agency and I knew you were dying to so, so I asked him if he could...
LORELAI: Make four girls very happy.
SOOKIE: Yeah and he did!
LORELAI: Huzzah for the Birnbaums!
RORY: Hey Sookie, if you got four tickets and you and mom go, then that means...
SOOKIE: Hmm, one for you and one for Lane! [Lane and Sookie hug] Oh, chickadee!
LORELAI: This is gonna be a very special night. And you know what a very, very special night deserves?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: [pulls out a hot pink dress] A new outfit!
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: What could the problem be?
RORY: This is the tackiest...
CUT TO CHILTON
MS. CALDECOTT: As I mentioned yesterday, we will be holding a debate next week. Your subject Did Charles I receive a fair trial' The pros will represent the parliament who deemed they had sovereignty and the cons will represent the monarch and try and prove that the charge against him was not legal. What is fascinating Mr. Dugray? [catching him looking at Rory]
TRISTIN: Uh, nothing Ms. Caldecott.
MS. CALDECOTT: Nothing Mr. Dugray?
TRISTIN: My notes - my notes are fascinating Ms. Caldecott.
MS. CALDECOTT: Yes they are fascinating Mr. Dugray. As I was saying, the pro and con teams will each have two minutes and 30 seconds for introductions, six minutes to debate, three minutes for conclusions and five minutes for questions from the audience. The winner shall be decided by a hand count from the rest of the class. Does that sound like fun Mr. Dugray? [again, he's looking at Rory]
TRISTIN: What?
MS. CALDECOTT: The debate. Does it sound like fun?
TRISTIN: Yes, it does.
MS. CALDECOTT: It does, doesn't it Mr. Dugray?
TRISTIN: Oh, it absolutely does Ms. Caldecott.
MS. CALDECOTT: More fun than staring at Miss Gilmore's ear?
TRISTIN: Yes Ms. Caldecott.
MS. CALDECOTT: Yeah, I think so too. Ok, any questions? Good, I'll assign your teams. [Pointing] You, you, you, you - con. You, you, you, you, - pro. [in background for next two lines] You, you, you, you - con. You, you, you -
PARIS: [whispers] Who did she point to?
MADELINE: [whispers] Well I think she... [looking at Louise and Rory]
PARIS: [stands up] Excuse me, Ms. Caldecott?
MS. CALDECOTT: Miss Geller?
PARIS: I wasn't sure who you pointed to just now.
MS. CALDECOTT: Oh, uh, let's see. You, Miss Lynn, Miss Grant and Miss Gilmore.
PARIS: Are you sure?
MS. CALDECOTT: Yes I am, but thank you for asking. [Paris sits] Ok, you, you, you and you - pro. You and you - con.
CUT TO HALLWAY
[Paris, Louise, Madeline and Rory standing around]
RORY: So I guess we should make a plan.
MADELINE: To do what?
PARIS: To work out our debate Madeline.
MADELINE: Oh, yeah right.
LOUISE: We need a place to work.
PARIS: My house is out.
LOUISE: Why?
PARIS: Because it is.
LOUISE: You need a reason.
PARIS: My mother is having the entire place redone, she wants all evidence of my father out of there. So unless you want to sit on no furniture, while watching three Harvey Fierstein impersonators rip up the carpet and paint everything a ridiculous shade of white and call it angel's kiss' then we're going to have to find somebody else's house to go to.
MADELINE: My brother has the measels.
LOUISE: My mom's having an affair.
RORY: Well I guess we can go to my house. I mean, we're having a town rummage sale so it's kind of a mess, but it's there.
LOUISE: Isn't your house kind of far?
RORY: It's thirty minutes away by bus.
LOUISE: Bus? I don't do bus'.
RORY: Well if you have a better suggestion -
PARIS: I'll drive.
RORY: Ok, so then tomorrow.
MADELINE: Tomorrow.
LOUISE: Fine.
PARIS: Fine.
TRISTIN: [walks right past Rory] Hey Paris.
PARIS: Tristin, hi.
TRISTIN: You know I was really hoping we'd be in the same group.
PARIS: You were?
TRISTIN: Oh yeah. I mean, it would make the long hours of studying go by a lot faster. Plus, come on - you and me on the same team, we'd wipe the floor with the others. I guess we'll just have to pair up on something else then huh?
PARIS: That would be good.
TRISTIN: Yeah it would. I'll see you later. Bye Madeline, bye Louise.
LOUISE: Tristin suddenly has very big eyes for you grandma.
MADELINE: Lucky.
PARIS: Stop it, he's just being nice.
MADELINE: He should be so nice to me.
LOUISE: And me.
PARIS: We need to get to class [the three of them leave. Paris is smiling.]
CUT TO RORY AND LANE WALKING TO KIM HOUSE
RORY: Tomorrow.
LANE: Wow.
RORY: Yup.
LANE: All three of them huh?
RORY: Double, double toil and trouble.
LANE: Well, it should make for an interesting afternoon.
RORY: With the pricking of my thumb, something wicked this way comes.
LANE: You're doing very well in the Shakespeare class aren't you?
RORY: Not bad.
LANE: Good.
RORY: Thanks. Ok so what's the plan?
LANE: We'll go in and ask her if I can go to a play tomorrow night with you and Lorelai.
RORY: A play?
LANE: I think that's the safest word. Show or concert would be very bad.
RORY: What about saying it's a movie?
LANE: Too far from the truth - almost a lie.
RORY: But a play is not a lie?
LANE: Well it's far away from the truth that it might work but close enough to the truth that I think I can negotiate a purgatory stint if forced to.
RORY: Play it is.
LANE: Ok, we're going in.
[pan to inside Kim household]
MAN: Are you sure it's an original Queen Anne?
MRS. KIM: Yes - original.
MAN: The joints look wrong.
MRS. KIM: Joints are fine.
MAN: They look new.
MRS. KIM: Not new, nothing's new - whole store is old.
MAN: Do you have a certificate or a letter that you write saying that it's old.
MRS. KIM: Yes, I'll write a letter.
MAN: Ok, well I guess if it's really old, I'll take it.
MRS. KIM: We appreciate your business.
LANE: [whispers to Rory] She just made a sale, now is a good time. [louder] Hi mama.
MRS. KIM: What's wrong?
LANE: Nothing.
MRS. KIM: You look flushed.
LANE: I do?
MRS. KIM: You eat candy?
LANE: No.
MRS. KIM: Doughnut?
LANE: No.
MRS. KIM: Hostess fruit-pie?
LANE: No, nothing, I'm fine.
RORY: Hello Mrs. Kim.
MRS. KIM: Rory.
LANE: Mama can I talk to you for a minute?
MRS. KIM: I'm busy.
LANE: I know, I was just wondering if I could go somewhere tomorrow with Rory and her mom.
MRS. KIM: Tomorrow is church.
LANE: This would be after church.
MRS. KIM: After church we think about what we heard in church.
LANE: Well I thought I could think about what I heard in church on the way to the show.
MRS. KIM: Show?
RORY: Play.
LANE: Not show, play - it's a play mama.
MRS. KIM: Tell me about this play. What's it about?
LANE: Ok, well, it's about a group of people who own instruments and stand in front of other people holding them.
MRS. KIM: What?
LANE: I'm not sure what it's about.
RORY: We could find out.
MRS. KIM: You find out, then we talk.
MAN: Excuse me, I'd really like that letter if you don't mind.
MRS. KIM: Yes I'm coming. [leaves]
RORY: How's that purgatory negotiation looking?
LANE: Not good.
RORY: What do we do now?
LANE: I'll ask again later.
RORY: Well call me if you need anything.
LANE: Thanks, I will.
CUT TO LUKE'S WITH A RUMMAGE SALE SIGN IN THE WINDOW
LUKE: If you want coffee, you'll have to wait.
RORY: Hey Luke, someone put a sign for the rummage sale up in your window over there.
LUKE: You can have decaf right now if you're in a hurry.
RORY: You should call the cops about this. I mean we all know how you feel about public displays of town affection.
LUKE: Your mom asked me to put it there ok?
RORY: And you said yes?
LUKE: She's not real good with no'.
RORY: No she's not.
LUKE: For every second you laugh at me, that's one second longer you're waiting for coffee.
RORY: Sorry, no laughing. [he leaves]
[Lorelai walks in with a black and brown polka dot cowboy hat on]
LORELAI: Margaret Atworthy just dropped off three boxes of city council pot holders and begged me to take her grandson. People are getting crazy man. What?
RORY: What are you wearing?
LORELAI: Hey, we have already argued about the sweatshirt.
RORY: Yes but we have not argued about the hat.
LORELAI: What hat?
RORY: The one on your head, Annie Oakley.
LORELAI: It's great isn't it?
RORY: As nice as it is that you're single handedly trying to rebuild the bridge, you have got to stop buying up other people's junk.
LORELAI: The money goes to charity. I look cute. Case closed. Oh finally, the coffee cavalry arrives.
LUKE: What the hell do you think you're wearing?
LORELAI: A hat.
LUKE: Take that off.
LORELAI: What?
LUKE: Now that is not yours, take it off.
LORELAI: But I'll have hat hair.
LUKE: I'm talking about the sweatshirt.
LORELAI: Luke calm down.
LUKE: That is not yours.
LORELAI: No, I found it in the bags of stuff for the sale.
LUKE: Oh so you just find something and then you take it is that it?
LORELAI: No, I paid for it.
LUKE: Oh so that makes it alright.
LORELAI: It makes it legal. What is the matter with you?
LUKE: Nothing. Nothing is the matter.
LORELAI: Luke...
LUKE: Pour your own coffee. [puts coffee pot down on the counter and leaves]
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
[Living room is stuffed with bags/boxes of stuff to the point where you can't see furniture]
LORELAI: [sighs] Ok just a question. Did anyone in town keep anything?
SOOKIE: Doesn't look like it.
LORELAI: I'm never being civic-minded again.
SOOKIE: Honey, you're doing a good thing. [falls] Ow!
LORELAI: Sookie!
SOOKIE: I'm ok.
LORELAI: Wave an arm.
SOOKIE: [Waving her arm] Here.
LORELAI: I gotcha. [takes her hand and starts to pull her up]
SOOKIE: Hold on, something down here likes me.
LORELAI: Oh.
SOOKIE: Yeah, I'm good. Hold on. Up, please.
RORY: Jeez this stuff is like tribbles.
LORELAI: Oh, thank God - just in time. Grab a bag and move it to the side of the room and be very careful, this pile just tried to eat Sookie.
RORY: Maybe I should sic it on Paris when she gets here.
LORELAI: Oh my God, that's right. You're studying here today.
RORY: Any minute actually.
LORELAI: Oh this place is such a pit.
RORY: Mom don't worry about it. They'll come in, they'll make a face, they'll say something snotty, we'll study, they'll leave. I'm just looking forward to this whole day being over, then I can concentrate on the concert.
LORELAI: Yeah.
MISS PATTY: Lorelai, sweetheart would you come outside please? I want to know where you want me to put these.
LORELAI: Coming Patty!
SOOKIE: Ok, two very large porcelain squirrels.
LORELAI: Set them free.
SOOKIE: Will do.
[Pan to outside. Patty's standing in front of big drums.]
LORELAI: Wow, huh. These are great. They'll really come in handy when we finally organize that giant marching band we've been talking about.
MISS PATTY: I danced on these drums at the Copacabana in 1969.
LORELAI: Wow.
MISS PATTY: Yeah, it was a great act. I wore bananas.
LORELAI: Oh please, tell me you have a picture of that.
MISS PATTY: [chuckles] A lot of memories happened on these drums. But I guess it's time to move on.
LORELAI: Yeah, sure. Now you'll finally have room for the enormous tuba you've hand your eyes on. [Miss Patty looks at her] Just leave - leave these here.
[Inside]
RORY: [on the phone] Yeah, you too. Bye. [hangs up] That was Lane [to Lorelai]
LORELAI: Oh and what's the verdict?
RORY: She decided to be stupid and tell her mother the truth - that she wanted to go to a rock concert with us tonight in New York.
LORELAI: Stupid.
RORY: Stupid.
LORELAI: I'm so sorry.
RORY: I'm making coffee.
MISS PATTY: Well this looks really familiar. [picking up Lorelai's sweatshirt]
LORELAI: Oh, that's mine. Er, I saw it first and then I bought it so it's mine now.
MISS PATTY: Really? Who brought it in?
LORELAI: I think Luke did and judging by his very hostile reaction he obviously wasn't done wearing it yet.
MISS PATTY: Oh my, I wonder if -
LORELAI: What?
MISS PATTY: [to Sookie] I bet this was Rachel's.
SOOKIE: Oh my God - Rachel's?
LORELAI: Rachel? Who's Rachel?
SOOKIE: Rachel was Luke's very serious girlfriend. It does look like her.
LORELAI: When did Luke have a girlfriend?
MISS PATTY: Oh this must have been what, five, six years ago? Did she break that man's heart. It was terrible.
LORELAI: How did I not know about this?
SOOKIE: Honey, you had an 11 year old kid and you were just moving into this house. Plus Rachel traveled all the time. She was a photographer.
MISS PATTY: Archeologist.
SOOKIE: Really?
MISS PATTY: Or a flight attendant.
LORELAI: I can't believe I never even heard about it.
MISS PATTY: At least I think so.
SOOKIE: Well Luke never talks about it. No one else likes to talk about it because he could probably k*ll you with that coffee pot if he wanted to.
LORELAI: Wow. I never pictured Luke having a girlfriend, or a broken heart.
MISS PATTY: Well I would keep this hidden if I were you. Well I gotta be going. Trampoline class at two.
SOOKIE: Bye Patty.
MISS PATTY: Bye.
LORELAI: Bye, thanks for the drums.
SOOKIE: Ok, these all need to be mended.
LORELAI: My room.
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm. Ok.
[Lorelai looks out the window and sees Paris, Madeline and Louise getting out of a car]
LORELAI: Rory, I think your friends are here. She must be one great babysitter to earn enough money for that car.
RORY: Let's just get this over with.
LORELAI: Take heart my dear. Suffer today party tonight.
LORELAI: [Opens front door] Hi.
LOUISE: Hi.
MADELINE: Hi.
LORELAI: Come one in.
RORY: So did you guys find it ok?
PARIS: There's no sign on this street.
RORY: I know, that's why I told you to turn right at the big rooster statue.
PARIS: I thought you were kidding.
LORELAI: Oh no, we never kid about Monty.
LOUISE: Monty?
LORELAI: Monty the rooster - Monty.
LOUISE: Oh.
RORY: Everybody this is my mom.
LORELAI: Lorelai.
RORY: This is Louise, Madeline and Paris.
LORELAI: Ah, very good girl-group names. Ok, so, um sorry about the house of horrors here. Some crazy lady volunteered to lead this charity thing and we're trying to get her some help, so make yourselves comfortable. Rory, just yell when you guys want pizza.
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: Ok. [goes upstairs]
RORY: So do you guys want to work in here or in the kitchen?
PARIS: Whatever.
RORY: Ok. [they sit in the livingroom]
PARIS: Ok, so here's how it should go. Madeline will do the introductions, I'll handle the debate, Rory will do the onclusion and Louise will take questions.
RORY: Why do you automatically get to handle the debate?
PARIS: Because I'm the most experienced at it.
MADELINE: Trust me, you want her to handle the debate. She never gives up.
LOUISE: Le pitbull.
RORY: Ok.
LOUISE: So what is all this stuff? [going through some bags]
RORY: Uh, it's for a big town rummage sale.
MADELINE: Like a charity thing?
RORY: Yeah. There's this old bridge that's completely falling apart and the town's trying to save it.
LOUISE: Oh cool hat.
PARIS: Put that down. It's used.
LOUISE: Vintage dear.
PARIS: Filthy darling.
MADELINE: There's this great store under my therapist office who has the best vintage clothes. I found an original Pucci top for practically nothing.
LOUISE: Oh Pucci is very big right now.
MADELINE: Is this a Pucci? [holding up a shirt]
RORY: No, that's a patty.
LOUISE: A patty?
RORY: Miss Patty. She's a dance teacher here. These are some of her old costumes.
LOUISE: Oh here Paris. Tristin might like this [holds up a pink sequence dress]
PARIS: Can we just work please?
LOUISE: Ugh. I would love to have a boyfriend that looked like Tristin.
MADELINE: Your boyfriend's no slouch either.
RORY: No he's not.
LOUISE: Oh yes - 6'2... and fiesty. So how's that going? Are you two still Joanie loves Chachi'?
RORY: God, I hope not.
MADELINE: You are still together aren't you?
RORY: Yeah, we're still together.
LOUISE: How long has it been?
RORY: I don't know.
MADELINE: You do too.
RORY: About a month.
LOUISE: Oh, lifers.
PARIS: Hey!
MADELINE: Jeez.
PARIS: We have a debate to organize here and this conversation is quickly veering towards the subject of french kissing and glitter eye shadow - trashy or trendy? And I for one have no intention of being humiliated in front of the whole class because we were forced to study in the middle of a carnival and you two couldn't keep your eye on the prize! I want to win and I'm going to win.
LOUISE: So how good of a kisser is Paul Bunyan anyway? [Louise, Madeline and Rory giggle.]
[Pan to Lorelai's room]
SOOKIE: Ok, does anyone in town have a peg leg?
LORELAI: Uh...no.
SOOKIE: Hem these.
LORELAI: So tell me more about this Rachel?
SOOKIE: Why are you so curious?
LORELAI: Well because apparently everybody in town knows everything about it and I don't like to be out of the loop.
SOOKIE: It's old news.
LORELAI: Yes but I'm fascinated. I mean, I go to Luke's once a day, sometimes twice - three times if Michel has talked to one of his relatives and his accent has gotten thicker. I feel I should know the whole story. What happened? Where'd she go?
SOOKIE: Well, Rachel liked to move around a lot. She was very adventurous person. She loved to climb things and fling herself off of cliffs and dive into these really tiny lakes and ride big wild horses and fly planes.
LORELAI: So she was wonder woman.
SOOKIE: She was to Luke. I thought they were going to get married.
LORELAI: What happened?
SOOKIE: The rumour is that Starts Hollow was too small for her. She wanted to live somewhere more exciting.
LORELAI: But Luke didn't.
SOOKIE: Mm. You know Luke. He lived here all his life. He wouldn't even go away for college. I think we're going to bury him in that diner.
LORELAI: Wow. It's sad.
SOOKIE: Yeah. Ok, well I am done here. I'm gonna stop by the inn for a while and then I am gonna go home and I'm gonna change for the show tonight.
LORELAI: We leave at 6.
SOOKIE: I will be here, bye
[Pan to living room]
PARIS: We'll need the actual quotes so learn them by heart.
MADELINE: What about using note cards.
PARIS: Note cards look sloppy. We will know our information.
MADELINE: But the other teams will use note cards.
PARIS: And the other team will lose.
SOOKIE: Bye girls, Rory, see you tonight!
RORY: Bye Sookie.
LORELAI: What's tonight?
RORY: We've got tickets to see the Bangles at the Pastorella theatre.
MADELINE: In New York?
RORY: Yeah.
LOUISE: Sounds potentially not boring.
RORY: It's gonna be great actually and the seats are amazing.
MADELINE: Who are you going with?
RORY: My mom and Sookie.
LOUISE: You're kidding?
RORY: What?
LOUISE: You're going to a concert with your mom?
RORY: Yeah.
MADELINE: I cannot imagine doing anything like that with my mom.
RORY: Actually we do stuff like this all the time.
MADELINE: Really?
RORY: Yeah.
MADELINE: Wow.
LOUISE: Hey, how old is your mom anyways?
RORY: 32.
MADELINE: Young.
LOUISE: So that means she had you when she was...
PARIS: 16. She had her when she was 16. We've done the math, can we just ooh' and aah' about this quickly and get back to work?
LOUISE: 16. I'm 16.
MADELINE: So am I.
PARIS: We're all 16 ok. Everybody in this room is 16.
RORY: Paris is right. We should work.
PARIS: Thank you.
LOUISE: I can't imaging having a baby at 16.
PARIS: Well then keep your knees shut.
LOUISE: Very nice.
MADELINE: Do you think your mom is sorry she got pregnant so young?
PARIS: Of course she is.
RORY: Why thank you.
PARIS: I didn't meant that. I just meant that...
RORY: I mean, I don't think she would recommend it but I think she's happy with how things turned out.
LORELAI: I am?
RORY: Yes you are.
LORELAI: Ok, just checking. Hey, I'm starving, is it pizza time yet?
RORY: Are you guys hungry?
MADELINE: I am.
PARIS: I can't eat dairy.
LORELAI: Ok, one with cheese, one without. Cokes?
RORY: Yes please.
MADELINE: Me too.
PARIS: We're never going to finish.
LOUISE: I find your mother completely fascinating.
RORY: Funny - so does she.
LOUISE: It's almost more like having a big sister.
MADELINE: And you like her don't you?
RORY: She's my best friend.
LOUISE: Truly, completely fascinating.
LORELAI: [from the kitchen] Rory come in here a sec!
RORY: I'll be right back.
[Pan to kitchen]
LORELAI: Hey, how's it going in there?
RORY: Truly, completely fascinating.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Well we've basically gotten no work down at all. Paris is having a meltdown, which by the way is always fun.
LORELAI: Sounds it.
RORY: And, I don't know, we've just been talking.
LORELAI: Well, I think you're actually making some friends here.
RORY: Let's not get ahead of ourselves. They've basically just moved off the plan to dump the pig's blood on me at the prom, that's all.
LORELAI: Talking, chatting, no work being done - there's friend potential going on.
RORY: Maybe - with Louise and Madeline at least.
LORELAI: Two out or three formerly psychotic enemies - not bad. There [handing Rory a plate]- pop-tart appetizers to tide you over till the pizza comes.
RORY: Thanks [turns to leave]
LORELAI: Hey, I have kind of a crazy idea.
RORY: Those are never comforting words coming from you.
LORELAI: Just consider this ok?
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: Now, we have four tickets to the show tonight.
RORY: Yes we do.
LORELAI: What if I give them to you? You take them.
RORY: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: Well, it just seems like you guys have kind of a bonding thing going on in there, it might be fun.
RORY: But what about you?
LORELAI: No, no you and I have already bonded. In fact, if we bond any further, we will be permanently fused together.
RORY: You've been talking about this concert since you heard about it.
LORELAI: I can still go.
RORY: How?
LORELAI: Sookie and I can buy cheap seats when we get there.
RORY: These tickets are 9th row aisle - dream seats.
LORELAI: Look, you don't have to do this, but I just think you have three years of Chilton ahead of you and it might be nice to have some friendly type people to talk to there. And I don't know, you guys seem to be getting along, it might be good. And I totally don't mind, I just want to see the show, I don't care from what seat.
RORY: Are you sure?
LORELAI: Completely sure.
RORY: Because I -
LORELAI: Oh ladies! [taking plate and going into the living room] Hey what are you guys doing tonight?
MADELINE: Why?
LORELAI: Well we have these really great tickets to see the Bangles at the Pastorella theater and Rory thought you might like to come along.
MADELINE: Are you serious?
LOUISE: No way.
RORY: Yeah - I mean if you guys want to.
MADELINE: I would love to go.
LOUISE: Count me in.
RORY: Paris, what about you?
PARIS: I can't.
LOUISE: Yes you can.
PARIS: No, I can't.
LOUISE: Because you're busy doing what?
PARIS: I have homework.
MADELINE: She'll be there.
RORY: Good.
LORELAI: Great.



CUT TO NY
[In the theater. Sookie squeals]
RORY: He made it [Louise and Madeline look at bracelet Dean made for her]
MADELINE: Oh he's handy. How great.
LOUISE: And you wear it all the time right?
LORELAI: Just when she's breathing.
SOOKIE: It's a love thing.
RORY: Thanks for the contributions.
LORELAI: Ok here [offers tickets but pulls them back] Ah! With these tickets you are about to enter sacred space, you will be treading on hallowed ground, you will be walking like and Egyptian.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Take'em. Oh you're going to have a great time. The Bangles are the best! They were my favorite band in high school. I almost named you Susanna. The day I found out you had no musical talent at all was the saddest day of my life.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: Well you say that now. Here, ok, these are probably located - Hi! [to usher]
USHER: Hi.
LORELAI: Can you tell me where these seats are?
USHER: Uh, those are right in here.
LORELAI: Oh good, girls...ok, here's the deal. Take the tickets, go to your seats, have the night of a lifetime - Bangle it up. The second the concert is over, meet us outside in front of the theater got it?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Good! Now go!
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome. [to Sookie] Ok, let's go make our noses bleed.
SOOKIE: After you.
PARIS: Which aisle is it?
LOUISE: We're almost there.
MADELINE: I have never sat this close to a stage before. In fact, I've never even really been to a concert before so I could be sitting at the back and say the same thing.
LOUISE: In here.
MADELINE: Oh good.
RORY: Wow, these are amazing seats.
LOUISE: [checking out the cute guys in the row behind them] Yes they are.
RORY: [to Paris] What are they looking at?
PARIS: One guess. [Rory looks behind them at the guys]
GUY: Check it out, we've got fans [seeing Rory]
PARIS: Was I right? [as Rory turns back]
RORY: You were right.
PARIS: And before it's dark, they'll have every picnic basket that's in Jelly Stone park.
[Pan to Sookie and Lorelai climbing stairs]
SOOKIE: Did you ever see Everest?
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: It's a good movie.
LORELAI: We must be getting close, we're running out of rows.
SOOKIE: And 1,000. Ok, we're here.
LORELAI: Great. Ok, this is fine [sitting]
SOOKIE: Not bad at all. [Lorelai starts to laugh] What? What? What is so funny?
LORELAI: [laughing] These are the worst seats in the entire world!
SOOKIE: They are, aren't they?
LORELAI: Oh my God, it's so funny. [to guy next to her] Don't you think this is funny?
GUY: You know, I don't.
LORELAI: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
SOOKIE: Ooh, they're starting. Do you have a lighter?
LORELAI: [laughing] You mean a flame thrower? [to guy] Do you get it? A flame thrower because it's so far.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen - The Bangles!
[Bangles play. Pan to later during the concert, Rory and Paris are watching the concert and Louise and Madeline are flirting with the guys in the row behind them. Pan to Lorelai and Sookie]
LORELAI: Hey, was Rachel pretty?
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: I'm just curious, was she pretty?
SOOKIE: She was pretty.
LORELAI: Like, what kind of pretty?
SOOKIE: What do you mean what kind of pretty'?
LORELAI: I mean, like was she a Catherine Zeta-Jones kind of pretty or a Michelle Pfiffer-y pretty or -
SOOKIE: She was an Elle MacPherson kind of pretty.
LORELAI: Really.
SOOKIE: Yup.
LORELAI: That's an intense kind of pretty.
SOOKIE: You're not kidding.
LORELAI: I never pictured Luke with an Elle MacPherson kind of pretty.
SOOKIE: No? Pictured him more with a Lorelai Gilmore kind of pretty?
LORELAI: Oh, the air up here must be very thin because you're delirious.
SOOKIE: And you're jealous.
LORELAI: What?
SOOKIE: You're jealous of Rachel.
LORELAI: You're accusing me of being jealous of a woman who dumped a man I'm not even interested in five years ago?
SOOKIE: Yes.
LORELAI: And you don't think that's crazy?
SOOKIE: Oh I do think that's crazy?
LORELAI: Right, I'm not jealous.
SOOKIE: Yeah you are.
[Lorelai scoffs. Pan to girls]
LOUISE: Oh my God! He is so gorgeous.
RORY: I guess.
LOUISE: Listen, there's a massive party going on right around the corner.
RORY: So?
LOUISE: So they invited us.
RORY: Who?
LOUISE: Jess and Sean, we've been talking to them this whole time, they're extremely cool.
MADELINE: Are we going?
RORY: Going where?
MADELINE: To the party?
RORY: There's a concert going on.
LOUISE: The band won't miss us.
RORY: We can't just leave Louise.
LOUISE: It's America Rory.
RORY: We have to meet my mom after the show.
LOUISE: Oh come on.
RORY: What do you mean Oh come on'. We have to meet my mother after the concert. The band may not miss us but Lorelai sure will.
MADELINE: These guys are so cute.
RORY: Oh that's great but we're not going anywhere.
LOUISE: What are you afraid?
RORY: Of going out into a strange city with two guys I don't know? Yeah.
MADELINE: Rory please!
RORY: No!
LOUISE: Well we're going.
RORY: No you're not.
LOUISE: Paris, join please?
PARIS: No, thanks.
LOUISE: Fine, come on Madeline.
RORY: And just what am I supposed to tell my mother?
LOUISE: That you're a very good little girl. [gets up and leaves]
RORY: Louise.
MADELINE: The party's in a building on the corner of Waverly and First. Try to get away. [leaves]
RORY: Madeline.
MADELINE: We'll be back by the time the concert's over.
PARIS: You know, I really like this band.
[Pan to later. Rory and Paris waiting]
PARIS: Well?
RORY: I couldn't find Mom or Sookie anywhere.
PARIS: So what do we do now?
RORY: I guess we just wait here for them to find us.
PARIS: Ok.
RORY: I can't believe Louise and Madeline would just leave like that.
PARIS: They've done it before.
RORY: Nice.
PARIS: Yeah, well.
RORY: Can I ask you a question?
PARIS: Maybe.
RORY: What could you possibly see in Tristin?
PARIS: You wouldn't understand.
RORY: Is it just that he's cute?
PARIS: Partly.
RORY: Cause there are a lot of cute guys in the world.
PARIS: Not like Tristin.
RORY: He's just such a jerk.
PARIS: He's not always a jerk.
RORY: No?
PARIS: No.
RORY: Ok. When is not a jerk?
PARIS: I've known Tristin a really long time ok? We've been in the same class since kindergarten.
RORY: Really?
PARIS: Yes...and he has things in his life that are hard. His parents - not so great. We have that in common.
RORY: Ok.
PARIS: He kissed me once.
RORY: He did?
PARIS: In the 6th grade - on a dare.
RORY: How romantic.
PARIS: You just don't know him like I do ok?
RORY: Ok, I believe you. I just - I think maybe you could do better.
PARIS: I know he's flirting with me to get to you, but at least he's flirting with me.
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: There you are.
LORELAI: Think fast [throws them a t-shirt each] T-shirts for all the girls because I'm the good witch of the - hey, aren't you missing a couple of kids?
RORY: They left.
LORELAI: Excuse me?
RORY: Madeline and Louise met these guys and they -
LORELAI: What guys?
RORY: I don't know, they were sitting behind us and they were having a party.
LORELAI: Unbelievable!
SOOKIE: What's going on?
LORELAI: They left.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: Let's go, come on, move.
CUT TO APARTMENT BUILDING
LORELAI: I leave the house with four girls, I'm coming home with four girls. [knocks on a door] Hi, I'm looking for a couple of college boys, who might live here or have friends who live here.
WOMAN: I don't talk to anyone. People annoy me. [closes door]
LORELAI: [coming up to Sookie listening at a door] What?
SOOKIE: She found him with the blonde again.
PARIS: She's gonna knock on every door in the entire building isn't she?
RORY: Yep.
PARIS: Wow.
LORELAI: [knocks] Hello? Is anyone home?
SOOKIE: [knocks] Hello? [dog barks] Aah! Let's go follow your mother.
PARIS: I wonder if I was missing if my mom would come looking for me like that.
RORY: Paris, you know she would.
PARIS: Yeah, or at least she'd send somebody.
[Lorelai knocks on another door. There's music playing]
SOOKIE: Music.
LORELAI: Let's go. [knocks. Guy answers]
RORY: Mom, that's one of the guys.
GUY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Thanks. Hi, could you move please? [enters]
GUY: What?
LORELAI: Hey, did you miss me?
LOUISE: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Ms. Gilmore. Put the cups down, let's move.
GUY: Is there a problem?
LORELAI: Yeah, see those two idiots over there? They're 16 - underage and I bet you're not. I also bet those big fancy party cups aren't holding lemonade. You really want to end any further conversations with me so step aside Skippy. Move your asses outside - now! [they leave apart.] Hey. I am not even going to begin to tell you how completely insane it is to take off with anyone you don't know, or drink things that you don't know what's in them, or act like you have a clue when you don't, but so help me God if you ever pull a stunt like this again, it will not be around my kid! Do you understand me?
LOUISE: Yes.
MADELINE: Yes.
LORELAI: Good, now let's go. I can't wait to meet your parents. We have some catching up to do. I think we'll just talk and talk and talk all night long.
PARIS: You know what? I think this is the best night I've ever had.
CUT TO RUMMAGE SALE
LANE: I cannot believe I missed it.
RORY: The concert was amazing.
LANE: Forget about the concert. I wanted to see Lorelai pull those idiots out of that guy's apartment.
RORY: It definitely was a Kodak moment.
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey, you didn't wake me up.
RORY: I set the clock.
LORELAI: Yes, but see the clock stops ringing once I throw it against the wall giving me ample time to fall back to sleep, you however never stop yapping no matter how hard I throw you, thus ensuring the wake up process.
LANE: I'm gonna get a soda, anybody want anything?
RORY: Gum.
LORELAI: Yes, the night of my 14th birthday back so I can right the green-hot-pant-roller-disco outfit wrong.
LANE: Coming right up.
LORELAI: Bye. So, talked to anybody today?
RORY: You mean Madeline or Louise or Paris?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Right.
RORY: Though I bet school tomorrow will be really interesting.
LORELAI: Oh yes - stories of Rory's Bangle's - obsessed mother ripping open apartment doors, scaring the pointy haired boys.
RORY: Totally uncool, man.
LORELAI: I had to do it Rory, they could've gotten hurt.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: God, I thought inviting those girls out would make things easier for you at school.
RORY: Yeah, well I've always thought easy' is completely overrated.
LORELAI: Oh, that's my twisted girl.
RORY: Plus Paris decided to let me split the debate time with her.
LORELAI: Wow! [pause] Wait, why am I wowing?
RORY: Because splitting debate time with Paris is like doing that whole spitting in your palm and shaking hands' friendship oath thing.
LORELAI: But way less gross?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Oh, good, I'm glad then. Oh, uh, I'll be right back.
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: [coming up to Luke] Hey.
LUKE: Oh, hey.
LORELAI: Find anything good?
LUKE: Oh yeah, I got some refrigerator magnets shaped like sushi for a nickel, so basically I scored.
LORELAI: Oh good.
LUKE: Hey, look, about that thing that happened the other day -
LORELAI: Oh forget it.
LUKE: I was a jerk, I didn't mean it.
LORELAI: I know - really
LUKE: Yeah well, I am sorry.
LORELAI: I wanted to give this back to you [offering Rachel's sweatshirt]
LUKE: Oh no, you bought it.
LORELAI: I know but it's yours and I didn't know.
LUKE: You didn't know?
LORELAI: About the former owner.
LUKE: Oh.
LORELAI: If I had, I wouldn't have flaunted it in front of you like that.
LUKE: Hey, it's not a big deal, I was having a bad day, that's it. Now I got magnetic sushi and all is right with the world.
LORELAI: Ok good. So here. It obvious
ly means something to you.
LUKE: But you have to let things go eventually right?
LORELAI: Yeah, but sometimes you need a little something to remind you. I mean you wouldn't want to forget everything would you?
LUKE: No there was some stuff that I definitely would not want to forget.
LORELAI: Well here, so you don't forget.
LUKE: Thanks, can I pay you for it?
LORELAI: In coffee, absolutely.
LUKE: Alright. I'm not pining you know -
LORELAI: I know
LUKE: Just remembering.
LORELAI: Got it.
LUKE: Remembering is not pining.
LORELAI: You're absolutely right.
LUKE: It's just like a memento, like restaurant matches.
LORELAI: I can see the resemblance.
LUKE: Ok, well good.
LORELAI: Bye Luke.
LUKE: Bye.

1.14 - That Damn Donna Reed
written by Daniel Palladino & Amy Sherman-Palladino
directed by Michael Katleman
(Dean walks into Lorelai's house carrying a pizza.)
DEAN: Hello?
LORELAI: Do you come bearing pizza?
DEAN: I'm not an idiot.
LORELAI: Then get in here.
RORY: Hey.
DEAN: Hey.
LORELAI: Sit -- you're missing it.
DEAN: What are we watching?
LORELAI: The incomparable "Donna Reed Show."
RORY: What's in there?
DEAN: A salad.
RORY: Salad?
DEAN: Yeah, it's a quaint dish sometimes used to precede large quantities of pizza.
(Lorelai and Rory give him strange looks.)
DEAN: It's for me.
RORY: Clearly.
DEAN: So, who's Donna Reed.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You don't know who Donna Reed is? The quintissential 50s mom with the perfect 50s family?
RORY: Never without a smile and high heels?
Hair, that if you hit it with a hammer, would crack?
DEAN: So it's a show?
RORY: It's a lifestyle.
LORELAI: It's a religion.
RORY: My favorite episode --
LORELAI: Mm, mm...tell me, tell me.
RORY: -- is when their son, Jeff, comes home from school and nothing happens.
LORELAI: Oh that's a good one. One of my favorites is when Mary, the daughter, gets a part-time job and nothing happens.
RORY: Another classic.
DEAN: So what's this one about?
LORELAI: This one is actually quite filled with intrigue. The husband, Alex, comes home late for dinner and he didn't call.
RORY: Might as well kick the dog too.
LORELAI: Oh, oh, look, she's making doughnuts.
DONNA REED: ...behind in the sugar department.
JEFF: I guess I was thinking of something else, Mom.
LORELAI: "Not that my sugary attitude wouldn't make anyone an instant diabetic."
RORY: Mother-daughter window washing. We should try that.
LORELAI: Yeah, right after mother-daughter shock treatments. "You know, Daughter, there's nothing more satisfying thatn washing windows -- oh no!"
RORY: "What? Did I miss a spot?"
LORELAI: "No, I just had an impure thought about your father, Alex. Funny -- I don't know why I had it. It isn't the second Saturday of the month."
RORY: (in a deeper voice) "Hey, I heard you had an impure thought."
LORELAI: "I must now sublimate all my impure thoughts by going into the kitchen and making an endless string of perfect casseroles."
DEAN: You're not even listening to the dialogue.
RORY: Ours is better.
DEAN: I don't know -- it all seems kind of nice to me.
RORY: What does?
DEAN: Well, you know, families hanging together. I mean, a wife cooking dinner for her husband. And look -- she seems really happy.
LORELAI: She's medicated.
RORY: And acting from a script.
LORELAI: Written by a man.
RORY: Well said, Sister Suffragette.
DEAN: What if she likes making doughnuts and dinner for her family and keeping things nice for them and --
(Rory and Lorelai stare at him.)
DEAN: OK, I feel very unpopular right now.
DONNA REED: You, know, dear, the first ten years we were married, I was upset when you came home late for dinner.
ALEX: And you're not anymore?
DONNA REED: Nope. You are no longer late for dinner. You're just extremely early for breakfast.
DEAN: Hey, I'm not saying a word.
(Cut to Lorelai and Rory entering Luke's.)
RORY: Can brains hurt?
LORELAI: Yes, it's hypochondria hour.
RORY: No, I'm serious. Last night when I was reading my biology chapters I distinctly heard a ping in the vicinity of my brain.
LORELAI: Your brain pinged?
RORY: Yeah. It just went like "dink."
LORELAI: Well then, honey, your brain dinked. It didn't ping.
RORY: Well I don't think a dinking brain is any less worrisome than a pinging brain.
LORELAI: Well, you got me there.
RORY: So should I go to a tumor doctor?
LORELAI: No, you don't have a tumor. You're reading too much. You're probably just losing your eyesight.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
(Luke comes to take their order.)
LORELAI: Hi, can you take a little constructive criticism?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: OK. This place could use a makeover.
LUKE: Hmm.
LORELAI: Yeah. It just needs a sprucing up. Like a coat of paint.
LUKE: I don't spruce.
LORELAI: What do you mean you don't spruce?
TAYLOR: What he means is he won't spruce, that's what he means.
LUKE: Taylor, do not start.
TAYLOR: Me and the rest of the town beautification committee have been hounding him for years to freshen up the place -- maybe a couple of nice zinnia pots out front, some yellow awnings, a peppy little cardboard pig announcing the specials -- but he's a mule. He won't talk, he won't reason, he won't spruce. You might as well forget it, Lorelai. I'm forgetting it too.
LUKE: Finally a Taylor Doose position I can get behind.
TAYLOR: Faded paint is a bad reflection on the whole town.
LUKE: Whatever happened to giving up?
TAYLOR: When standards slip, families flee and in comes the seedy crowd. You got trouble, my friends.
LORELAI: Right here in River City!
TAYLOR: This is not funny, Lorelai.
LUKE: Does anyone want anything?
LORELAI: Uh, yes, I do. I want to know why you won't paint this place.
LUKE: Painting's a pain. I'd have to close the place for a day -- which I can't afford -- or paint it in the middle of the night -- which I don't want to do because I hate painting.
LORELAI: OK, how about this? I'll help you. I love to paint.
LUKE: You do?
LORELAI: Yes, I do.
LUKE: You love it?
LORELAI: I want to marry it.
LUKE: You have strange passions.
RORY: She likes washing dishes too. She's mult-faceted abnormal.
LORELAI: Ah, come on. We'll drink a couple beers, we'll sing painting songs.
LUKE: Painting songs.
LORELAI: Yeah, painting songs. Like, uh, you know, the song that goes, um...(singing) "Grab your brush and grab your rollers/All you kids and all you...bowlers/We're going paintin' today!" Say yes or there's another verse.
LUKE: Well I guess maybe...if I had help.
TAYLOR: Really? Oh my God! That's wonderful! Hurrah!
LUKE: Taylor, it's not for you. It's for me.
TAYLOR: I can't wait to tell the rest of the committee. They're not going to believe this.
LUKE: I hate that he's pleased.
LORELAI: Ah, you'll drop a gum wrapper on the street in front of his store later.
LUKE: Yeah, good idea.
(Cut to the Gilmores' weekly Friday night dinner.)
LORELAI Mmm. Kick-ass wine.
EMILY: How poetic.
LORELAI: It's got a nice smell: earthy, vibrant. I can taste the Italians' feet.
RICHARD: It's a Bordeaux. It's French.
LORELAI: Ah. What's an Italian foot doing in a French wine?
RORY: So when do you guys leave for Martha's Vineyard?
RICHARD: Ah, we're not going to Martha's Vineyard this year.
RORY: Really? Why not?
RICHARD: Our usual rental wasn't available when we inquired -- late.
EMILY: We should have just bought a place years ago like I wanted.
RICHARD: It wouldn't have been prudent.
EMILY: Now we have no place to go next week.
RORY: Well you could always go somewhere else, couldn't you?
RICHARD: We always go to the Vineyard at this time of year.
LORELAI: Well, you know, you could break the chain, Dad. Go to Paris.
RORY: Yes, Paris!
LORELAI: Impressionism, poodles.
RORY: Creme broule.
LORELAI: Oh, that's great!
RICHARD: Impossible!
LORELAI: Porquoi? (to Rory) French.
EMILY: We only go to Europe in the fall.
LORELAI: You know, Mom, I heard a rumor Europe's still there in the spring.
RORY: I heard that too.
EMILY: We know that it's there in the spring but we never go in the spring because we always go in the fall.
LORELAI: It's getting a little too Lewis Carroll for me.
RICHARD: Well what is so interesting about Europe in the spring?
LORELAI: Spring vegetables.
EMILY: You want us to go to Europe to eat a vegetable?
LORELAI: No, Mom. I don't know. There's all kinds of stuff. There's festivals and, you know, Europe.
EMILY: In the fall.
RICHARD: It costs a fortune to travel first class in Europe. We only do it every two years.
EMILY: In the fall.
RICHARD: It's just not in the budget this year.
LORELAI: You don't have to fly first class.
(Emily and Richard look stunned.)
LORELAI: 'Cause there's always coach.
(Ricahrd looks horrified.)
LORELAI: Or business class is slightly less. There's deals on the internet. (no answer) Hmm. Pass the potatoes.
RORY: You got it.
(Cut to Lorelai's kitchen. She's mending Rory's Chilton sweater while Rory is wearing it. Rory is using index cards to study. Occasionally she reaches across the table for another card.)
RORY: Catherine the Great - 1729 to '96. Empress of Russia - 1762 to '96.
LORELAI: OK, hold still please.
RORY: Originally named Sophie Friedricke Augustine von Anhalt-Zerbst.
LORELAI: But everybody called her "Kitten."
RORY: Married to Grand Duke Peter of Holstein in 1754.
LORELAI: OK, Rory, seriously.
RORY: The marriage was an unhappy one.
LORELAI: Well there were way too many names.
(Rory reaches for another card.)
LORELAI: Ow! Lady with notecards just look at lady with needle and just try to focus for one second so that I can sew the button on your sweater and not on my thumb.
RORY: I'm sorry.
(Knock on the door.)
RORY: I'll get it!
(Rory rushes to the door.)
LORELAI: Oh, you're four years old.
(Rory lets Babette in.)
BABETTE: Oh, hiya, baby doll.
RORY: Hi, Babette.
LORELAI: Hey! Do you want some coffee?
BABETTE: Oh, no thanks. I just came over to ask a great big favor.
LORELAI: Ask away.
BABETTE: Well, see, Morey just got a call to play a gig at the Village Vanguard tonight so we got to go to New York.
LORELAI: Oh wow! Cream?
BABETTE: And sugar. Thanks. Anyway, yesterday Morey and I finally broke down and we got ourselves a new little baby, you know?
LORELAI: Oh, honey, you got a kitten! Good for you.
RORY: What's its name?
BABETTE: Apricot. He's just the cutest thing. But he's so teeny. There's no way he can go with us and I would hate for him to stay all alone in the house so I was thinking maybe Rory could come over and house-sit for the evening.
RORY: I'd love to.
BABETTE: Oh great! We've got a kitchen full of food and Morey just got cable so you can watch those four girls talking dirty if you want to.
RORY: Sounds good.
BABETTE: You're an angel. Both of you -- angels. You have a key, right?
LORELAI: We got it covered.
BABETTE: Oh great. All right. I'll leave ya the number where we're staying. Have a good time. We'll be back tomorrow morning. I love you crazy girls.
LORELAI: Bye!
BABETTE: Bye!
(Babette leaves.)
LORELAI: Wow. I can't believe how fast you jumped at the chance to spend a night away from me.
RORY: You're crazy. I'm doing her a favor.
LORELAI: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Sure you are.
RORY: Mom!
LORELAI: No, no, that's OK. Don't you worry about me. I'll be just fine.
RORY: I'd like to debate you on that last subject but I'm late for the bus.
LORELAI: You know, this is only like the second night we've ever spent apart. Doesn't that make you sad?
RORY: Yeah, but I'll get over it.
LORELAI: Uh-huh. Well, Paul and Linda McCartney only spent eleven nights apart their entire relationship. Did you know that?
RORY: I did not know that.
LORELAI: Well they were truly devoted to each other. Just the being apart was too painful to even talk about.
RORY: I understand.
LORELAI: I don't think that Linda would have even considered cat-sitting without Paul.
RORY: You know, Mom, when I go off to college, I'm gonna be gone every night. What will you do then?
LORELAI: Well, I will go with you. I will sleep on the floor in your dorm, next to your bed.
RORY: Well at least you've got a plan.
LORELAI: Yes. Um, perhaps you'd like to take a picture of me with you tonight, you know, just in case you get lonely, you can talk to it.
RORY: Bye.
(Cut to a man leaning against a streelight while singing. Dean is waiting for Rory's bus.)
DEAN: Carry your bird, Miss?
RORY: Hi! I didn't expect to see you here.
DEAN: Just wanted to say hello.
(He kisses her.)
RORY: Hello.
DEAN: Hello.
(They kiss again.)
RORY: Hello.
DEAN: So...who's your friend?
RORY: Homework.
DEAN: Really?
RORY: We will be cohabitating for the next month so I can examine its every move. Jealous?
DEAN: I'll get over it.
RORY: So -- hey -- I'm house-sitting tonight for Babette and I was thinking maybe if the right offer came along I might be up to some company.
DEAN: Well I'm offering.
RORY: I'm accepting.
DEAN: Good.
RORY: You want to get some coffee?
DEAN: I can't. I have to get to work.
RORY: I thought you go to work at five.
DEAN: No, four on Thursdays. For some reason Thursday is always really busy. Lots of oppressed housewives shopping for their husbands' dinners.
RORY: Wow.
DEAN: What?
RORY: That was a little pointed.
DEAN: What are you talking about?
RORY: That crack about the housewives shopping for their husbands' dinners.
DEAN: Come on -- it was a joke.
RORY: Yeah, well, it was a pretty weird joke to hear coming out of your mouth.
DEAN: You are so sensitive about the whole Donna Reed thing.
RORY: I'm not sensitive about it. I just find it ridiculous.
DEAN: Why?
RORY: What do you mean why?
DEAN: Well, so she cooked a lot.
RORY: A lot? She made homemade doughnuts, chocolate cake, a lamp chop-mashed potato dinner, and enough stew to feed Cambodia all in one episode.
DEAN: So what?
RORY: You really like that concept, don't you?
DEAN: No, I -- well, yeah, sort of.
RORY: Oh my God.
DEAN: I mean, it's a little over the top but the general idea of a wife cooking dinner for her husband and family, that's nice. Why is that not nice?
RORY: It's not just that. It's the having to have the dinner on the table as soon as the husband gets home and having to look perfect to do housework and the whole concept that her one point in life is to serve somebody else.
DEAN: Fine, yes, but maybe there are two points of view here.
RORY: I don't think so.
DEAN: Well you just feel that way becasue your mother feels that way.
RORY: Oh -- what -- so I have no opinions of my own?
DEAN: I didn't mean that.
RORY: Well if I have no opinions of my own then I guess I'd be just the kind of girl you like.
DEAN: Rory, my mom used to make dinner for my dad every day before she started working. And now she even does it on the weekends. So what does that say about her?
RORY: It says that she has a choice and Donna Reed didn't.
DEAN: You do realize that Donna Reed wasn't real, don't you?
RORY: Yes, I know she wasn't real, but she represented millions of women that were real and did have to dress like that and act like that.
DEAN: Please tell me how we got into an argument about The Donna Reed Show.
RORY: I don't know.
(Dean sighs.)
DEAN: OK, look, I got to go to work.
(Dean starts to walk away.)
RORY: Dean.
DEAN: What?
RORY: Bird?
DEAN: Oh.
(Dean gives Rory back her chick.)
(Cut to Lorelai sitting at the kitchen table cutting out pictures from magazines. Rory enters the house.)
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Hey, good. I was just about to leave.
RORY: Where are you going?
LORELAI: To Luke's. We're picking out paint colors tonight so it's going to be hours of "yes," "no," "yes," "no," "yes," "no," until my world-famous perseverence wears him down and he winds up in a ball on the floor crying like a girl. Wanna come watch?
RORY: I'm house-sitting tonight, remember?
LORELAI: Yeah, but you have to eat. Come have a quick burger.
RORY: No thanks.
(Rory sets the bird cage down in front of Lorelai.)
LORELAI: Oh! What is that?
RORY: It's for school.
LORELAI: Oh, he's so cute! What's his name?
RORY: Case Study Number Twelve.
LORELAI: Is it hyphenated? Honey, he's adorable. He should have a name.
RORY: I'm not bonding with my midterm, thank you.
LORELAI: Alright, I'll name him. (to chick) Hi! Your name is Stanley. Hi, Stanley.
RORY: It's a girl.
LORELAI: Oh. (to chick) Sorry about the Stanley thing. Your name is Stella. (to Rory) Stella's nice and Stella was married to Stanley.
RORY: Call it whatever you want.
LORELAI: You're grumpy. What happened?
RORY: Nothing, just a long day.
LORELAI: You know what the remedy for a long day is? A ringside seat while Luke envisions strangling me with his baseball cap.
RORY: I'm gonna leave the chick here for the night so the kitten doesn't get any fancy ideas.
LORELAI: OK.
RORY: She's already been fed and if she gets too loud just put her in my room. I'll call you later.
LORELAI: OK. Hey...are you OK?
RORY: Yeah. Just a bad afternoon. I'll fix it.
LORELAI: OK. Call me if you need a wrench or something.
RORY: I will.
(Rory leaves.)
LORELAI: (to chick) Stella.
(Cut to Luke's.)
LORELAI: Now, this is another way to go. Sort of a French bistro kind of look.
LUKE: This isn't a French bistro
LORELAI: Really? Huh. It's amazing the things you learn when you bother to listen.
LUKE: Which you usually don't.
LORELAI: Yes, but then I don't have a lot of useless information intruding in my brain.
LUKE: Thank God.
LORELAI: Now, if you wanted to do more warm, golden Tuscan countryside --
LUKE: Then I'd go to Italy. (to customer) Here, I'll wrap this up.
LORELAI: We could also go with a pastely English country garden theme. Oh, maybe we could add a little stenciling on the ceiling.
LUKE: No stencling!
LORELAI: Excuse me -- do you even know what stenciling is?
LUKE: Does Martha Stewart do it?
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: (firmly) No stenciling.
(Taylor and Kirk come in.)
TAYLOR: Ask him.
KIRK: I will.
TAYLOR: Well, go on.
KIRK: Don't push. Hello, Luke.
LUKE: What do you want, Kirk?
KIRK: Taylor here tells me that you're thinking of painting this place.
LORELAI: That's right, he is.
TAYLOR: Ha!
KIRK: Excuse me, I'd like to hear it from him. Luke, is--is it true?
LUKE: Yes, Kirk, it is true.
KIRK: Really?
LUKE: Yes.
KIRK: And that's your final decision?
LUKE: I'm afraid it is.
KIRK: Because it's not too late to --
TAYLOR: You heard him! He's painting this place. Pay up.
(Kirk hands Taylor some money and heads for the door.)
TAYLOR: Thank you.
LUKE: Sorry, man.
KIRK: It's a little too late for that, don't you think?
(Taylor follows Kirk out, stopping to look at Lorelai's paint samples.)
TAYLOR: Ooh, I like this.
(Taylor leaves. Luke rolls his eyes.)
LORELAI: OK, I get it.
(Cut to Babette's. Rory is putting Apricot's food into a dish. Apricot meows.)
RORY: Hold on. There you go. Meow if you need anything else.
(Rory leaves Apricot with her food and and tries to study but can't concentrate. She goes the the phone and dials.)
RORY: Hi, is Dean in? This is Rory. (pause) Oh. Well, will you tell him I called? (pause) OK, thanks.
(Cut to Luke's)
LORELAI: You ready to talk paint?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Good. I've got all the choices set up and while any one of them would work, I think this combo is currently my favorite.
LUKE: Huh.
LORELAI: See? Imagine. This will be for the walls and this will be for the trim -- the, like, edging around the doors and the windows.
LUKE: I know what the trim is.
LORELAI: OK. The colors are actually quite similar to what you have here now, but they're just a little richer, a little warmer. What do you think?
LUKE: Well.
LORELAI: Wait, wait, wait.
(Lorelai goes to dim the lights.)
LORELAI: A little ambiance.
LUKE: This is a diner. We don't do ambiance.
LORELAI: All right. One argument at a time. So what do you think?
LUKE: Honestly?
LORELAI: Yep.
LUKE: I have no idea. You like it?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: OK.
LORELAI: Good.
(Andrew bursts in with a camera and starts taking pictures.)
LUKE: What are you doing?
ANDREW: Oh -- um, the town council wanted to do a before and after poster.
LUKE: Out!
ANDREW: Bye.
(Luke flips the sign to "Closed" and locks the door.)
LUKE: That's it. We're closed for the night.
LORELAI: You know, listen -- since you have to take everything off the walls to decide what stuff you're going to keep and what stuff you're to get rid of.
LUKE: Everything stays.
LORELAI: OK, there's a plastic dancing pork chop that says --
LUKE: Everything stays.
LORELAI: "I lost my head over a good chop. You should too."
LUKE: Everything stays.
LORELAI: Ok. Everything stays.
LUKE: You know, this place hasn't been painted since my dad was alive.
LORELAI: No, I didn't know that.
LUKE: He painted it before he opened it and once more when the roof caved in one winter. I think that's probably it.
LORELAI: The paint lasted a long time. He got his money's worth.
LUKE: Yep. He really loved this place, you know. This store was his life. Mine too, I guess. I spent every minute I wasn't in school here. I spent a lot of minutes I was supposed to be in school in here too.
LORELAI: How come you opened a diner? Why didn't you keep it a hardware store?
LUKE: I don't know. I didn't love the hardware business the way my dad did, and, you know, I knew how to cook, so I just thought a diner would be more...fun.
LORELAI: (laughing) That's a hard word for you to say.
LUKE: (laughs) Yeah. I just always wanted to work here. Just where Dad did.
LORELAI: God that's nice. To be so -- I don't know -- connected to your dad. That's -- I would have loved that.
LUKE: Well you've got that with Rory.
LORELAI: Yeah...I guess so.
LUKE: You know, I still think there's a spot on the wall somewhere where my dad took an order one day when he ran out of paper.
LORELAI: Really? Where?
LUKE: I don't know. Behind the counter maybe.
(Lorelai goes behind the counter.)
LUKE: Next to the door. On the right side.
(Lorelai sits on the floor. Luke joins her.)
LORELAI: Oh. Huh. Here it is: "Three hammers, Phillips-head screwdrivers --"
LUKE: "and three boxes of nails in assorted sizes."
LORELAI: Oh.
LUKE: I've seen it from time to time.
(They laugh.)
LUKE: Yeah, well, I guess it is time for a little spruce.
LORELAI: Yeah, it is. But let's not spruce this particular spot.
LUKE: That sounds good.
LORELAI: OK.
(They look at each other then hear voices outside. Luke starts to get up.)
LUKE: Oh, jeez --
LORELAI: No, no, don't get up.
LUKE: But if I don't get up --
LORELAI: They'll go away. They'll go away, trust me. Shh.
(Taylor rattles the doorknow and knocks on the window.)
TAYLOR: What are they doing? They should be in there. Just imagine it all in pastels. The whole thing.
(When they can't see anything, the crowd leaves.)
LUKE: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome: (whispers) I should go.
LUKE: OK.
LORELAI: Ah, so. It's going to be great.
LUKE: Oh, I'm sure it is.
LORELAI: See ya.
LUKE: See ya.
(Lorelai leaves.)
(Cut to Lane's room.)
RORY: Lane?
LANE: Yo.
RORY: Hey how's it going?
LANE: Very well. I have discovered that in addition to my lameness in geometry I also will not become a biologist, French translator, or Civil w*r buff.
RORY: Well I guess that just leaves bass player for the Foo Fighters.
LANE: I also wouldn't rule out keyboardist in the Siouxsie and the Banshees reunion tour.
RORY: I like that you keep an open mind.
LANE: So what's up?
RORY: I need to borrow a CD.
LANE: Which one?
RORY: The weird one.
LANE: I need more information.
RORY: I don't know which one it is but I'd know it if I saw it.
LANE: OK, well let's have a look.
(Lane pulls up various floorboards to reveal hidden CDs.)
LANE: We have classic rock, progressive rock, pretty boy rock --
RORY: Excuse me?
LANE: Bon Jovi, Duran Duran, The Wallflowers, Bush.
RORY: Got it. Next?
LANE: Punk, New Wave, German metal bands. Broadway soundtracks.
RORY: Interesting filing systerm.
LANE: Anything yet?
RORY: Nope, sorry.
LANE: OK, well over there we have jazz, jazz vocals, classical, country, rockabilly, Sinatra -- The Capitol Years. Oh wait! The miscellaneous section.
RORY: Hey, that sounds right. William Shatner. Is this the one where he sings Tambourine Man?
LANE: And Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
RORY: Remind me to get this for my mom for her birthday. Oh wait. Hey, that's it. Can I?
LANE: Take it.
RORY: Thanks.
LANE: So what are you doing?
RORY: Um, I'm not completely sure yet.
LANE: OK. Well I want details.
(Cut to Lorelai getting home. She looks in the chick's cage -- it's empty.)
LORELAI: (yelling) Stella!
(Lorelai starts looking all over the house for Stella.)
LORELAI: Oh, no. No, no. OK. Stella, do something. Show yourself. Molt or chirp or something. Oh this is so not funny. Not funny, not funny. Oh this is so unbelivable. All day long, just chirps like a maniac at the top of her lungs. Now, nothing. Silence. Marcel Marceau chicken. OK, that's OK. I can fix this. We can fix this.
(Lorelai goes to the phone.)
LORELAI: I'm going to make this better. I'm going to fix --
LORELAI: Hello?
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Luke? Stella got out and I don't know -- do I put seed on the floor? Do I make cheeping sounds? Or do I pull a Lucy Ricardo and walk like a chicken so she thinks I'm her mother?
LUKE: Who the hell is this?
LORELAI: What do you mean who is this? It's Lorelai. Who else would call you looking for her baby chick?
LUKE: You're right. I'm the idiot. Go on.
LORELAI: Could you come over here, please, and help me?
LUKE: Uh, yeah, OK. I'll be right over.
LORELAI: OK, hurry!
(Luke knocks.)
LORELAI: Thank God. Get in here.
LUKE: This place is a disaster. What's going on?
LORELAI: OK, the last sighting was here, by the InStyle magazine. But then she burrowed through the Glamour and jumped over the Cosmo and knocked over a brand new bottle of nail polish so all I can tell you is if there was any doubt that this chick was a girl, well, there isn't anymore.
(Stella cheeps.)
LORELAI: OK, there she is!
LUKE: Jeez -- what was that?
LORELAI: Stella! Stella!
LUKE: You really do have a chick loose in here.
LORELAI: Yeah, I told you I had a chick loose in here. There she goes by the kitchen!
(They run after Stella.)
LORELAI: Don't step on her!
LUKE: She cut right in front of me.
LORELAI: OK, well she's being graded so let's not squash her.
LUKE: Well then tell her to watch where she's going.
(Cut to Babette's house. The phone rings.)
RORY: Hello?
DEAN: Um, I wasn't sure if you still wanted me to come over.
RORY: Oh, I do. I do, I absolutely do.
DEAN: Are you sure?
RORY: Yeah, I'm totally and completely -- You're teasing me.
DEAN: Yeah, a little. But I did appreciate the enthusiasm.
RORY: So how long until you get here?
DEAN: Actually, not long at all.
RORY: Why where are you?
DEAN: Right outside.
(Rory goes to the door and opens it. She's wearing a Donna Reed dress.)
DEAN: Uh, what the --
RORY: Honey, you're home.
RORY: Well, say something.
DEAN: Trick or treat?
RORY: What? You don't like it?
DEAN: No, I do. It's -- uh -- it's got a large circumference.
RORY: Thank you. Now come on in. It's cold outside.
(They go inside.)
DEAN: Oh my God.
RORY: Here, let me take your coat.
DEAN: Uh, thank you.
RORY: You're welcome.
DEAN: Interesting music.
RORY: I'm glad you like it.
DEAN: So what's that?
RORY: Oh, just some appetizers before dinner.
DEAN: Before dinner?
RORY: Yeah.
DEAN: Are we going out?
RORY: No.
DEAN: Ordering pizza?
RORY: Nope.
DEAN: So...?
RORY: I made you dinner.
DEAN: Excuse me?
RORY: Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes --
DEAN: Wait, you made me dinner?
RORY: That's right.
DEAN: You made me dinner.
RORY: And dessert.
DEAN: OK, what is going on here?
RORY: I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious. It's Donna Reed night.



(Cut to Lorelai's.)
LORELAI: I swear, she went over there.
LUKE: We looked over there.
LORELAI: Well, she went under that chair and she didn't come out.
LUKE: We moved the chair, we searched the floor, nothing.
LORELAI: Well then she went under the chair and through a hole in the floor.
LUKE: There is no hole in the floor.
LORELAI: Well maybe there was a hole in the floor and she crawled through it and fixed it.
LUKE: So she's s super intelligent chick with great physical and deductive k*ll?
LORELAI: Yes.
LUKE: Oh, this is not a chick I want to find.
LORELAI: Hey, Luke, what did you mean earlier?
LUKE: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: When you got here. You made some comment about me not really having a chick in the house.
LUKE: Hmm.
LORELAI: I mean, if I didn't have a chick here, why did you think I was calling?
LUKE: No, I thought you were calling about the chick.
LORELAI: It didn't seem like it.
LUKE: Well maybe it didn't seem like it but it was.
LORELAI: Was what?
LUKE: Was what I thought -- can we just keep looking?
LORELAI: OK. I just still think that --
LUKE: There she is.
LORELAI: Where?
LUKE: There!
(Crash)
LORELAI: Careful.
(Cut to Babette's. Rory and Dean are eating dinner.)
RORY: Well?
DEAN: What can I say?
RORY: You can say it's perfect.
DEAN: It's perfect.
RORY: Thank you. How is it really?
DEAN: It's perfect.
RORY: Yeah?
DEAN: It's amazing. I mean, I've never had anyone make dinner for me before. Except my mom, and, believe me, it's not the same.
RORY: I'm extremely glad to hear that.
(Dean reaches for another helping.)
RORY: Wait, wait, you want to save room for dessert, right?
DEAN: Oh, that's right. So...what's for dessert?
RORY: Lime Fantasy Supreme.
DEAN: Which is?
(Rory goes to the refrigerator.)
RORY: Green Jell-o and Cool Whip!
DEAN: You are insane.
RORY: Oh, no, I forgot to make the rolls.
DEAN: What?
RORY: I was going to make rolls.
DEAN: Well that's OK.
RORY: I can't belive I forgot them.
(Rory starts to open the rolls.)
DEAN: What are you doing?
RORY: I'll make 'em now.
DEAN: Hold on, it's -- come on, we really don't need rolls.
RORY: Donna Reed would have never forgotten the rolls. They're gonna make me turn in my pearls.
(They kiss.)
DEAN: I promise I'll kick anyone's butt who comes near those pearls.
(They kiss again.)
DEAN: Rory?
RORY: Yes?
DEAN: As amazing as this whole thing was, I mean, the music, the outfit, the dinner, I hope you know that I don't expect you to be Donna Reed. And I don't want you to be Donna Reed. That's not what I meant. This just totally got blown out of proportion. I'm actually pretty happy with you.
RORY: I know and I appreciate that, but aside from this actually being fun, I did a little research on Donna Reed.
DEAN: You did research on Donna Reed.
RORY: Look. See, she did do the whole milk and cookies wholesome big skirt thing, but aside from that, she was an uncredited producer and director on her television show, which made her one of the first women television executives. Which is actually pretty impressive.
DEAN: Well I'm glad this turned out to be such a positive experience for you.
RORY: It has been. And even though I'll probably never get the feeling back in my left little toe, I'd do it again.
DEAN: Yeah?
RORY: Someday. But for now I'd better get these dishes cleaned up.
DEAN: Oh, well, I'll help.
RORY: Sorry, you're a man. You can't help for another fifteen years.
DEAN: OK, well, then, as the man I will do what the man is supposed to do.
RORY: Go bowling?
DEAN: Take out the trash.
(Cut to Lorelai's.)
LORELAI: She's never going anywhere ever again. I'm thinking of slipping some super glue on the bottom of the cage. That would be bad, right? I mean, I know staples are bad but what's the verdict on super glue?
LUKE: Ask Stella.
(Luke is taking out the trash, including a broken lamp.)
LORELAI: Oh, you don't have to do that.
LUKE: This stuff is sharp. I want to get it out of the way.
LORELAI: Well, thanks for helping.
LUKE: No problem. I'm going to throw this stuff outside.
(Luke goes outside just as Dean is stepping out Babette's door. On their way to the trash cans, they meet between the two house.)
DEAN: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
DEAN: What are you doing here?
LUKE: What are you doing here?
DEAN: You first.
LUKE: I'm looking for a chick.
DEAN: Yeah, me too.
LUKE: You are not.
DEAN: Well, neither are you.
LORELAI: Hey, Luke, is there -- Dean.
DEAN: Uh, Lorelai, hi.
LORELAI: Fancy meeting you here.
LUKE: Yeah.
DEAN: Well, uh --
RORY: Hey, the Jell-o is doing this weird melting thing and I -- oh, Mom, Luke.
LUKE: Rory.
RORY: Hi.
LORELAI: Uh, what the hell are you two doing?
DEAN: Nothing. She, uh -- well we ate dinner. You know, steak and beans --
RORY: Canned.
LORELAI: Canned.
RORY: Not fresh.
DEAN: No.
LORELAI: No.
DEAN: And potatoes.
RORY: From a box.
DEAN: But they were still good.
RORY: Thank you.
DEAN: You're welcome.
RORY: So what were you guys doing?
LORELAI: Oh. Uh -- In the house...
LUKE: And then the lamp sorta -- I'm gonna get going.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: I'm sorry about this.
LORELAI: Forget it.
LUKE: OK. Bye.
DEAN: Yeah, I probably better go too. Thanks for dinner.
RORY: You're welcome.
(Luke and Dean leave.)
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Well, OK, you're 16. You have a whole house to yourself for the evening. I expect that you're going to have your boyfriend over. But what is with the apron?
RORY: It's a long story.
LORELAI: Did it involve a sharp blow to the head?
RORY: I gotta go check on Apricot.
LORELAI: Oh my God! I just saw the pearls.
RORY: I'm going in now.
LORELAI: You know what? I'm going inside too. 'Cause I have to write down all the ways I'm gonna torture you about that outfit.
RORY: Good night!
(Rory goes inside.)
LORELAI: Could I just get a picture though? 'Cause visual aids would really help. Oh, oh! Oh the shoes! I am dying. Oh.
(Rory rushes back outside.)
RORY: Mom! I can't find Apricot!
LORELAI: What? No!
RORY: She was on the couch when I came out, and now, nowhere.
LORELAI: That's it! We are not animal people! Period.
(Cut to the kitchen at the inn. Lorelai walks in.)
MICHEL: It was a tiny little favor.
SOOKIE: We have had this discussion before, Michel.
MICHEL: You are being unreasonable.
SOOKIE: I have my standards.
MICHEL: But this is a simple request.
SOOKIE: You are asking me to compromise my artistic and my culinary values.
LORELAI: Michel wanted an egg white omelette.
SOOKIE: Yes.
LORELAI: Crazy man.
MICHEL: Why? Why am I crazy man? I didn't have time for breakfast this morning, so very nicely I asked her to make me an egg white omelette cooked very dry with some tomatoes, mushroom, maybe a little chives, and she gives me this.
LORELAI: What is this?
SOOKIE: A three egg omelette with goat cheese cooked in a sherry olive oil.
MICHEL: I don't eat dairy or meat. You know this.
SOOKIE: I am a chef, Michel. It is my job to make food that tastes good.
LORELAI: (eating the omelette) And you do sister!
MICHEL: But I can't eat like that and look like her. (gestures to Lorelai)
LORELAI: You don't know what you're missing.
MICHEL: That will k*ll you.
LORELAI: You gotta go someday.
MICHEL: But someday all of this will catch up with you. You will become the balloon lady, and with any luck I will be here to enjoy it.
(Michel stomps out.)
LORELAI: But you make a good egg white omelette.
SOOKIE: I know.
LORELAI: Ah. Who wants to hear about my night?
SOOKIE: Oh, me!
LORELAI: Well, it started with Rory's baby chick getting loose in the house and ended with Rory and I up at one in the morning looking for Morey and Babette's new kitten, who we found asleep in the piano.
SOOKIE: Wow, that's very Wild Kingdom of you.
LORELAI: Yeah. I'm like the Marlin Perkins of Stars Hollow.
SOOKIE: You want some coffe?
LORELAI: Please.
SOOKIE: So how's Rory's chick?
LORELAI: Uh, better than my lemon lamp.
SOOKIE: What's the matter with your lemon lamp?
LORELAI: Luke k*ll it.
SOOKI: On purpose?
LORELAI: Well I can't prove it, but I will.
SOOKIE: What was Luke doing there?
LORELAI: Well I called him when I got home and Stella wasn't there.
SOOKIE: Stella is the chick?
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: I like that name.
LORELAI: 'Streetcar Named Desire'.
SOOKIE: Vivian Leigh or Jessica Tandy?
LORELAI: Hello -- Tandy.
SOOKIE: Of course. Continue.
LORELAI: So I evaluated the situation in my usual calm, collected manner --
SOOKIE: Hmm.
LORELAI: And then I called Luke to help me track her down.
SOOKIE: That's when he broke the lamp?
LORELAI: Yeah, he's not very graceful. You know, he said the weirdest thing.
SOOKIE: 'May I break your lamp?'
LORELAI: Well he got there and I was looking for Stella and he said, 'Oh, you really do have a baby chick loose in the house,' like I made that up, or -- I don't know.
SOOKIE: Well.
LORELAI: Well what?
SOOKIE: Well you call someone and you say, 'Can you come over and help me look for my loose chick?' It's a little...
LORELAI: A little what?
SOOKIE: It sounds a little like the code for, 'I'm not wearing any underwear.'
LORELAI: That's not the code for 'I'm not wearing any underwear.'
SOOKIE: OK.
LORELAI: Sookie, you're not serious?
SOOKIE: Look, the first time Jackson and I...you know.
LORELAI: Yeah.
SOOKIE: Yeah. I called him up and I told him I had a bat in my attic.
LORELAI: Well, honey, you do have a bat in your attic.
SOOKIE: So, he came over and went in the attic and he knew there was no bat and I knew there was no bat, but we pretended to look for it, and then when we couldn't find "the bat" we went downstairs and we had a bottle of wine..
LORELAI: So you're saying Luke thought I made up a crazy story about a chick being loose in the house just to get him in bed?
SOOKIE: Not just to get him in bed, but maybe he thought you wanted to see him and you didn't know how to say it.
LORELAI: That's nuts.
SOOKIE A woman asking a man to come over late at night to her house. Come on.
LORELAI: Yeah. But this is Luke we're talking about.
SOOKIE: Uh-huh. Why did you call him?
LORELAI: Because I needed help.
SOOKIE: Yeah. Why didn't you call me?
LORELAI: Because I assumed you would be with Jackson.
SOOKIE: Uh-huh.
LORELAI: Well I did.
SOOKIE: Why didn't you call Rory?
LORELAI: Because she would have been furious to find out that Stella was missing.
SOOKEI: Why didn't you call Patty? She raises chickens.
LORELAI: Sookie.
SOOKIE: Or Andrew? He lives right around the corner, doesn't he?
LORELAI: What is your point?
SOOKIE: My point is that you called Luke. Out of all the people in town that you could have called that would have come over and dropped what they were doing, you called Luke.
LORELAI: Because I had just been with him. We were picking out paint samples. He was on my mind. It was purely a timing thing.
SOOKIE: Picking out samples.
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: For Luke's place.
LORELAI: Yes.
SOOKIE: So you could paint together.
LORELAI: Once again, yes!
SOOKIE: Mm-hmm. Which I believe was your idea.
LORELAI: OK, so now the fact that I suggested painting Luke's diner also means that I wanted to get him in bed. All of a sudden I'm trying to get any poor, unsuspecting person in bed with me. I'm like -- I'm Michael Douglas!
SOOKIE: Lorelai. This --
LORELAI: Just -- thanks for the omelette.
SOOKIE: No, honey, I'm sorry. I don't want you to be mad. Don't be mad at me.
LORELAI: I'm not mad, I'm not mad. I'm tired.
SOOKIE: OK. You know, Luke is a really nice man.
LORELAI: Bye, Sookie.
(Cut to Emily and Richard's. Emily answers the door.)
EMILY: Rory, Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hey, we thought maybe the doorbell wasn't working.
EMILY: Come in.
LORELAI: We were ringing it and ringing it and nobody -- I guess we'll just come in.
(Emily has gone back to the main room, where she and Richard are talking to a man on the speaker phone.)
EMILY: And that would be the same as what we were paying for our old place?
JOHN (on the phone): Exactly the same.
RICHARD: Except for the grounds fees.
JOHN: Well the grounds fees are higher.
EMILY: But the grounds are larger, Richard.
RICHARD: I'm just trying to get all the information, Emily.
EMILY: All the information is that this is our last chance to go to Martha's Vineyard for the season. That's all the information.
JOHN: Emily, Richard.
RICHARD: I realize the position we are in, but this is a business transaction.
EMILY: Oh for heaven's sake.
JOHN: Richard, Emily
RICHARD: As a business transaction, one in which money goes out and we receive certain goods and services --
EMILY: And he's patronizing me, how lovely.
JOHN: Emily, Richard.
RICHARD: I must treat this conversation with the same care and devotion to detail I would any conversation that would be considered a business transaction. Kindly allow me to do so.
JOHN: Richard! Emily! Please!
EMILY: Goodness, you startled me.
JOHN: I'm sorry, I just wanted to say that I'm sure we could negotiate the grounds fee.
RICHARD: Well, that will be fine.
JOHN: Good. I'll get into this right now and I'll get back to you.
EMILY: Thank you, John.
RICHARD: Yes, we'll talk to you later.
JOHN: Bye.
EMILY: Careful, Richard. That canary you ate is going to spoil your dinner.
LORELAI: What's going on?
RICHARD: Oh, your mother and I have just secured a place on Martha's Vineyard.
RORY: Really, that's great!
LORELAI: I thought you lost your old place.
EMILY: We did. But this afternoon we found out that Arthur Roundtree had died.
RICHARD: He'd been drinking.
EMILY: So we got on the phone and snatched that place up.
RICHARD: Oh, it's a fine piece of property.
EMILY: Much better than our usual place.
LORELAI: The both of you are going directly to hell, I hope you know that.
RICHARD: Well, at least we'll be well rested.
LORELAI: Touche.
EMILY: I am so thrilled about this.
RICHARD: I'm glad.
EMILY: The two of you must come up for the weekend. It is so lovely. Rory would just love it.
RORY: Can we go for a weekend?
LORELAI: We'll see how much Valium Auntie Sookie can lend Mommy, OK?
EMILY: The only drawback of course, is that we had to rent the place furnished, and Arthur had dreadful taste. Remember the library, Richard?
RICHARD: Pink and green! Horrible. Just horrible.
LORELAI: Well he's dead now so he got his.
EMILY: Lorelai, you're being morbid.
LORELAI: I'm being morbid?
RORY: New subject please!
LORELAI: Joan and Melissa Rivers here think I'm being morbid.
EMILY: Rory, what's new in your life?
RORY: Nothing. Just school, homework.
LORELAI: Aprons.
RORY: Do not go there.
EMILY: What does she mean, aprons?
LORELAI: Nothing. I was just teasing her.
EMILY: About aprons?
LORELAI: Yeah.
EMILY: I don't understand
LORELAI: It's not important.
EMILY: Then humor me.
LORELAI: Nothing. Rory just dressed up in a cute apron the other day and so I was teasing her about it.
RICHARD: Why did you get dressed up in an apron?
LORELAI: (pause) Well. We've decided to give up on that pesky Harvard dream and focus on something more realistic. Mom, Dad, Rory's decided to become a maid, just like I was.
Is that funny? Did she think that was funny?
RICHARD: What would have posessed you to say such a thing?
EMILY: And in front of Rory?
LORELAI: I was kidding.
EMILY: God. My heart stopped.
LORELAI: Why don't you tell them about your bird? That seems like a safe subject.
RICHARD: Your bird?
RORY: Yeah, it's for school. Each of us have to follow a chick through its entire growth process. Everything has to be logged. Eating habits, sleeping habits.
LORELAI: Houdini habits.
RORY: She got out.
LORELAI: She ran far.
RORY: But she lived.
LORELAI: She's a better bird for it.
RORY: Thank God Luke found her.
EMILY: Luke found her?
LORELAI: What?
EMILY: Rory said that Luke found her.
LORELAI: Paying me back for the apron thing?
RORY: Sorry.
EMILY: Did the bird get loose at Luke's diner?
LORELAI: No.
EMILY: No?
LORELAI: The bird got loose at home.
EMILY: Your home?
LORELAI: Yes.
EMILY: Ah.
RORY: So, Grandpa, when's your next trip?
RICHARD: Ah, Madrid, the twelfth.
RORY: Wow.
RICHARD: I think there's a nice addition of cervantes in it for you.
RORY: Gracias.
EMILY: What was Luke doing at your house?
LORELAI: Oh, look, there's no ice. I'll get some.
EMILY: I asked you a question.
LORELAI: He was helping me find the bird, Mom.
EMILY: Really?
LORELAI: Yes, really.
EMILY: And how did he know that the bird was missing? What, was he strolling by your house and he heard your plaintive cries for help?
LORELAI: Mom.
EMILY: Or the helpless cheep of a chick in trouble?
LORELAI: I called him, Mom. OK? I called him and asked him to come over and help me look for the bird. OK?
EMILY: It seems like this man is always around when you're in trouble.
LORELAI: He's a good friend.
EMILY: Oh, please.
LORELAI: Do we have to discuss this?
EMILY Lorelai, I'm getting a little tired of being lied to.
LORELAI: Apparently we do.
EMILY: This man was at Rory's birthday party, he came to the hospital with you, he's the male lead in every story you tell, you go to the diner every single day. I've seen the way he looks at you, the way you look at him. I'm not a fool.
LORELAI: Mom, please.
EMILY: Why do you treat me like I don't have a clue in the world as to what is going on in your life? Now I'm asking you, as a favor, if you have any respect for me at all as your mother, just tell me. Do you have feelings for this man?
LORELAI: I don't know. Maybe I do. I haven't given it much thought. Maybe I do.
EMILY: Thank you. I'm glad you were finally honest with me. Now we can discuss what on earth you could possibly be thinking. Don't forget the ice.
(Cut to a man playing a guitar and singing as he walks across the street.)
LUKE: So, you're sure we need this many cans?
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, you need enough for two coats and touchups and little spots. No, I'm not sure.
LUKE: Well we got the paint and the brushes and the tarps and all the other stuff the paint guy said we'd need, so I guess we're ready.
LORELAI: Yes we are.
LUKE: The only thing left to do is figure out when.
LORELAI: How about Friday?
LUKE: Friday?
LORELAI: Yeah, I mean, you don't want the stuff sitting around. I don't know if paint goes bad, but judging by the smell of it when it's fresh, rotten paint would be really gross.
LUKE: Don't you have dinner with your folks on Friday?
LORELAI: Well, yeah, but I can get out early for a special occasion.
LUKE: Friday it is.
LORELAI: Good.
(Lorelai leaves Luke and walks down the street. Rory catches her.)
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Oh, hey, you!
RORY: Jeez -- you think you got enough paint?
LORELAI: I know, I tried to tell him. So, dinner, thoughts?
RORY: Let's have some.
LORELAI: How about Chinese?
RORY: Sounds good.
LORELAI: OK. I need to stop at the market and get some fruit.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: I think I'm getting scurvy.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: Yeah. Well that or a cold, but either way, I need some fruit.
(As they get to the market, they hear a motorcycle and turn around to look.)
TAYLOR: Damn motorcycles, they're a scourge.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Yeah.
TAYLOR: They're loud, they're dangerous. We should ban them from town.
LORELAI: Maybe we should set up barricades and ban all unwelcome strangers from crossing the border.
TAYLOR: Well! Well, no we couldn't do that, that would be illegal.
LORELAI: Darn laws.
TAYLOR: Oh, got to get away from that noise.
Taylor goes inside the market.)
LORELAI: k*ll me and bury me with that bike.
RORY: What is it? A Harley?
LORELAI: That is a 2000 Indian, 80 horsepower, 5 speed close ratio Andrews transmission and I want to get one.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Why not?
RORY: You'd die.
LORELAI: Oh, that.
(The bike stops at the market.)
CHRISTOHPER: Hey.
LORELAI: Hi.
CHRISTOPHER: Nice shirt. Take it off.
(He takes off his helmet.)
LORELAI: Christopher.
RORY: Dad!
(Rory runs to hug him.)
CHRISTOPHER: Hey!
RORY: This is great! What are you doing here?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm here to see you. And your mom, who's not saying anything about as loud as a person can.
LORELAI: Hello.
CHRISTOPHER: A word. Maybe there's a phrase in my future. OK, why is that man staring at me?
RORY: That's Taylor Doose. He owns the market. He knows all and sees all.
LORELAI: So, what's with the just showing up, Mr. Spontaneity Guy?
CHRISTOPHER: Well, my folks are back in Connecticut so I'm here to see them, and on the way I thought I'd stop by and surprise the Gilmore girls. Are you surprised?
LORELAI: Oh, the teeniest feather could knock me in the gutter.
CHRISTOPHER: So where would somebody find someplace to stay around here?
RORY: Stay, really? You're staying?
CHRISTOPHER: Thinking about it.
RORY: Stay with us!
LORELAI: Um, sweetie...
CHRISTOPHER: I don't think your mom --
LORELAI: No, it's not that, I'm still surprised.
RORY: Mom, please.
LORELAI: Why don't you stay with us for a couple of days?
CHRISTOPHER: Thanks, Lor. You won't even know I'm there. (to Rory) Hey, hop on.
LORELAI: Hop off.
CHRISTOPHER: Hop on.
LORELAI: Hop off.
CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai...
LORELAI: (sighs) Hop on.
(Rory gets on the back of Christopher's motorcycle and they ride down the street.)
LORELAI: Christopher.

CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
[Rory's putting blankets on the couch for Christopher]
RORY: He looks good don't you think?
LORELAI: He looks good.
RORY: I like his hair shorter.
LORELAI: Short is nice.
RORY: Do you think he'll stay long?
LORELAI: Wouldn't bet a lot of money on it.
RORY: Maybe we can get him to stay for a couple of weeks.
LORELAI: Absolutely - by weighting him down with blankets.
RORY: I just want him to be comfortable.
LORELAI: He's gonna come and go as he pleases babe, you know that.
RORY: Yeah, I know.
LORELAI: And no amount of bedding is gonna change that.
RORY: Yeah, but he's never been to Stars Hollow before.
LORELAI: I know.
RORY: Well that means something's gotta be different right?
LORELAI: Why don't you just enjoy the time you've got ok?
RORY: [pause] Yeah, ok. I still think something is different though.
CHRISTOPHER: [coming down the stairs] That is the worst shower I have ever had. Water pressure keeps changing every two seconds. I'm fixing it tomorrow.
LORELAI: Hey you stay away from my shower.
RORY: We ordered chinese food. It should be here any minute.
CHRISTOPHER: Good, I'm starving.
LORELAI: Here [handing him a cup of coffee]
RORY: Hey, how's Diane?
CHRISTOPHER: Uh, Diane is ancient history.
RORY: When I met her at Easter you said she could be the one.
CHRISTOPHER: The one to be gone by Memorial Day.
RORY: You're worse than mom.
LORELAI: Low blow.
CHRISTOPHER: Can't keep a feller happy?
LORELAI: Oh I keep them happy. I keep them very happy.
RORY: Ok, now. Don't get gross.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah you're upsetting us.
RORY: I'm gonna go study before the food gets here.
CHRISTOPHER: What? Tomorrow's Saturday.
RORY: I know, I like to get my weekend homework done and out of the way by Saturday night so then I can do extra-credit stuff on Sunday [leaves]
LORELAI: Don't look at me.
CHRISTOPHER: She's a great kid Lor. I wish I could say I see more of myself in her other than we have similar left ear lobes, but she's all you - chip off the old...perfect block.
LORELAI: Why the hell are you here?
CHRISTOPHER: Behold the queen of the subtle transition.
LORELAI: Why are you here?
CHRISTOPHER: You're gonna force me to lawyer up officer.
LORELAI: Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: Ok look. I've been making some changes, especially my career and I think I finally have all my ducks lined up in a row.
LORELAI: You're opening a sh**ting gallery.
CHRISTOPHER: I've been tying up loose ends in my life.
LORELAI: Do they make that much string?
CHRISTOPHER: You know you've always had that verbal thing, quick mind - it's annoying.
LORELAI: So you've been tying up loose ends.
CHRISTOPHER: I don't know how much your dad has told you but I'm on the verge of kind of a big success, it's for real this time. I've got a company with an actual cash flow, I've got employees, I've got an accountant for God's sake. He wears a tie and says words like fiduciary' and ironically'. I mean it's for real this time Lor.
LORELAI: I would love to believe it is.
CHRISTOPHER: [sighs] Why does your dad have more faith in my than you.
LORELAI: My father hit his head surfing Rincon a couple of years ago. His judgement's a little off.
CHRISTOPHER: So you have zero faith?
LORELAI: I've known you since I was six Chris. You're the guy that crashed his Porsche two hours after his parents gave it to him for his 16th birthday.
CHRISTOPHER: And you were the girl in the Pinky Tuscadero t-shirt sitting right next to me.
LORELAI: Horrified.
CHRISTOPHER: Think again.
LORELAI: Alright, having a blast then horrified.
CHRISTOPHER: Just listen to me will you?
LORELAI: I'm listening to you. Your life's back on track, I think that's great. And I appreciate you coming all the way out here, for the very first time might I add, to tell us that.
CHRISTOPHER: I didn't come out here just to tell you that.
LORELAI: No?
CHRISTOPHER: [sighs] There's some things I need to do...to take care of.
LORELAI: Like?
CHRISTOPHER: I haven't been enough a part of Rory's life. So I wanna be around more, to be a pal she can depend on. I mean I'm not crazy, I know there's already a life going on here and God knows she doesn't need anyone besides you but...if you give me a chance...
LORELAI: I've always had the door to Rory open for you.
CHRISTOPHER: I know.
LORELAI: You've hardly ever used it.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I wanna use it now. Is that ok?
LORELAI: Of course it is.
CHRISTOPHER: Good.
RORY:[coming into the living room] Hey, I forgot to ask you. Tomorrow morning I'm going to a softball game, do you wanna come?
CHRISTOPHER: You...play softball?
RORY: [laughing] Uh, no.
LORELAI: [laughing] You? Play softball? Good one.
CHRISTOPHER: Well ok, who's game is it?
RORY: It's my friend Dean's.
CHRISTOPHER: Dean?
RORY: Yeah Dean. The game starts at 9:00.
CHRISTOPHER: Uh, sure. It's a date. [Rory leaves. To Lorelai] She has a Dean?
LORELAI: She has a Dean.
CHRISTOPHER: How did this happen?
LORELAI: Well a single-celled organism crawled out of primordial ooze and that pretty much lead to Dean.
CHRISTOPHER: I need a beer.
LORELAI: Hey.
CHRISTOPHER: Yes dear?
LORELAI: [chuckles] There's a lot more than an earlobe resemblance there.
CHRISTOPHER: Good. Hey, thanks for the door thing.
LORELAI: Thanks for wanting it.
CUT TO SOFTBALL FIELD
[Luke's pitching and Dean's in the on deck circle]
DEAN: [to batter] You got it, you got the next one. Don't worry about it. [batter strikes out]
CHRISTOPHER: So which is your Dean?
RORY: That's him over there.
LUKE: Ok, we've got two outs.
RORY: And that's Luke.
CHRISTOPHER: Luke's the diner guy?
RORY: Yes. We eat there practically every day.
LUKE: Looks like we got out number three coming to the plate guys. [as Rory and Chris sit in the bleachers in front of Kirk]
DEAN: I'd send your boys a little farther into the field Luke.
LUKE: Why? Will they have a better view of you whiffing?
DEAN: You know, the only way I'm not hitting it, is if you don't have the strength to get it over the plate.
KIRK: The truth of the matter is that you can't pitch [pointing to Luke] and you can't hit [point to Dean]. So this'll be a terrific match up.
LUKE: Knock it off Kirk.
KIRK: A historic lack of action.
LUKE: Don't you have anything better to do with your Saturdays?
KIRK: What can I say, I'm addicted to comedy. [to Rory and Chris] Half an hour they been playing and it's tied zero - zero. [louder] Hey if you ever take this show on the road I got a name for you, zero and zero. Dean Zero and Luke Zero - get it?
LUKE: Doesn't even resemble clever.
KIRK: I'm dumbing it down for you Alfalfa.
CHRISTOPHER: How long do these games last?
RORY: Till they get tired. And then they say the first team to get a run wins.
KIRK: Yeah, it's real professional down there. Hey Luke, does your husband play softball too?
LUKE: Alright that's it. [starts for the bleachers]
KIRK: Um...I'm getting a page. I've gotta go. [jumps off the bleachers and starts running.]
[Dean comes over to Rory]
DEAN: Hey.
RORY: Hey. Dean this is my dad. Dad, this is Dean.
CHRISTOPHER: Dean.
DEAN: Uh, nice to meet you.
CHRISTOPHER: Same here.
DEAN: So do you live in the area?
CHRISTOPHER: No I had some time so I rode my bike out from Berkley.
DEAN: Really? What do you got?
RORY: [proudly] It's a 2000 Indian.
DEAN: I got an '86 Suzuki.
CHRISTOPHER: Nice!
DEAN: Yeah.
LUKE: Dean come on!
DEAN: I gotta go. [to Rory] I'll see you later. [to Christopher] I was nice meeting you. [runs onto the field]
CHRISTOPHER: So that was a Dean?
RORY: That was a Dean?
DEAN: [to Luke] Hey, uh, next run wins alright?
LUKE: [sighs] Yeah alright.
CUT TO INN KITCHEN
[Michel and Sookie are laughing as Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Wow!
SOOKIE: Wow what?
LORELAI: Wow! I have never seen you two enjoy a pleasant moment together.
SOOKIE: Oh come on.
MICHEL: Oh you have seen us enjoy a pleasant moment!
LORELAI: No, not ever.
MICHEL: Oh you are being absurd.
SOOKIE: You have to admit, they are few and far between.
MICHEL: Through not fault of mine.
LORELAI: I'm just saying, it's refreshing you know? It's not the usual Grr' that's all.
SOOKIE: Through no fault of yours? I'm sorry, but you're the one that's so...I don't know.
MICHEL: Oh I think you do otherwise you wouldn't have started saying it.
SOOKIE: Just yourself - caustic.
MICHEL: You mean obnoxious.
SOOKIE: You're words not mine.
MICHEL: Go to hell [leaves]
LORELAI: Oh no, I'm just saying it's refreshing to see you two just - oh yeah.
SOOKIE: You - get in here and tell me the happenings at home.
LORELAI: I'm assuming you mean did we get our toaster fixed' and no, it's been cold pop-tarts for a week, it's like a damn Dicken's novel.
SOOKIE: I'm not talking about the toaster, I'm talking about the man.
LORELAI: Ah.
SOOKIE: So what's it like having him around the house all the time?
LORELAI: Well it's, um, a little weird. We have fewer clean towels than usual.
SOOKIE: Come on give me something. Tell me how you feel, I'm dying here.
LORELAI: Honestly, I've been trying to figure out how this makes me feel since he asked me to take off my shirt the other day.
SOOKIE: Excuse me?
LORELAI: No, it was a - kind of a hello' kind of thing.
SOOKIE: Wow. He's smooth.
LORELAI: Yeah. I mean I have not seen this man since last Christmas right. We hear from him maybe once a week - maybe. And then all of a sudden he's here in my town and Rory's running around all excited and he's sleeping on the couch and I'm thinking should I be mad, should I send him to a hotel' but then he smiles and it's...Christopher.
SOOKIE: Here. [handing her a biscotti]
LORELAI: I mean not matter how many years go by, no matter how long I don't see him for, whenever I do, it's always...Christopher. What do I do with this? [holding up biscotti]
SOOKIE: Dunk. Go on.
LORELAI: [sighs] This man knows all my secrets. All of my bad girl moments happened with him - my worst fashion choices, my big hair days, the wearing of the Bonnie-Bell lipsmackers around my neck - it was all with Christopher.
SOOKIE: So do you think you two will -
LORELAI: No.
SOOKIE: Oh well that's convincing.
LORELAI: I don't know I - he wants to be involved with Rory. He wants to spend more time with her, be a pal.
SOOKIE: It's about time.
LORELAI: Yeah that's good.
SOOKIE: Yes.
LORELAI: Yeah - if it's true.
SOOKIE: And if it's not?
LORELAI: Then it's [sighs] Christopher.
CUT TO STREET
[Rory's showing Christopher around town]
RORY: This is the town flower shop. Um, over there is a good pizza place. That's the stationary store and that's Al's Pancake world.
CHRISTOPHER: Good pancakes?
RORY: Oh he doesn't serve pancakes.
CHRISTOPHER: Ok.
RORY: He switched to international cuisine a couple of years ago, and dropped the pancakes. He would've changed the name but he had already printed like a million napkins with the original name so he just kept it.
CHRISTOPHER: What kind of international cuisine?
RORY: He kind of hops around. Last month it was his salute to Paraguay.
CHRISTOPHER: Anyone salute back?
RORY: Not really.
MISS PATTY: Rory! Honey! How are you sweetie?
RORY: Great. Miss Patty, this is my dad, Christopher.
MISS PATTY: Your dad.
CHRISTOPHER: Nice to meet you.
MISS PATTY: You're Rory's father, well, well, well. You know Christopher, we're all like Rory's parents around here and I'm one of her mothers. And since you're her father, well that would make us...a couple. [laughing] A couple of what I don't know.
RORY: Ok, well we've got to be going.
MISS PATTY: Yes well, come back and see me.
CHRISTOPHER: I will.
MISS PATTY: [laughing] Bye. [As Rory and Chris cross the street she takes out her cell phone and dials]
[As Rory and Chris pass the market]
TAYLOR: Well you must be Rory's father.
CHRISTOPHER: Uh, yes I am.
TAYLOR: Taylor Doose, grocer to Stars Hollow.
CHRISTOPHER: Very nice to meet you. [they keep walking. To Rory] News travels fast around here.
RORY: Yes it does. [behind them you see Taylor dialing.]
CHRISTOPHER: Bookstore. Good. Come on.[they enter. Jackson and Andrew are there]
JACKSON: Hey, hey Christopher! Jackson Melville.
CHRISTOPHER: Hello.
JACKSON: Boy I gotta tell you, did they get your description wrong.
CHRISTOPHER: Really?
JACKSON: Oh yeah, much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt. Hey Andrew.
ANDREW: Yup.
JACKSON: Don't you thin he's much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt?
ANDREW: I'm going with the Billy Crudup comparison myself.
JACKSON: Really?
ANDREW: Oh yeah.
JACKSON: I don't see it. Well maybe from the side. Hey do you mind?
[Jackson grabs him and turns him from one side profile to the other]
CHRISTOPHER: What? Uh, no, not at all.
JACKSON: Well there's a little Crudup in there. Huh, well it's nice to meet you, whoever you look like.
CHRISTOPHER: Nice to meet you. [tugs at Rory as they go down an aisle] Ok, I'm kidnapping you and getting you out of here.
RORY: They all mean well.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I'm sure all lunatics have the best intentions. Ok, so I hear you like books.
RORY: Why yes I do.
CHRISTOPHER: Well I would like you to pick something out and let my buy it for you.
RORY: Dad you don't have to buy me anything.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on, what's the book of your dreams right now?
RORY: Well that would definitely be the Compact Oxford English Dictionary, but dad -
CHRISTOPHER: Excuse me - one Compact Oxford English Dictionary please.
ANDREW: Ok.
RORY: Dad no, it costs a fortune.
CHRISTOPHER: You need something to remember this visit by.
ANDREW [bringing a very large and heavy book] Here you go.
CHRISTOPHER: Holy mother. This is the monolith from 2001.
RORY: It has every word ever recorded in the English language plus origins and earliest usage.
CHRISTOPHER: You sure you wouldn't rather have a car, they weigh about the same. Here you go. [handing over a credit card]
RORY: This is so nice of you.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well I've got a lot of things to make up for.
RORY: No you don't.
CHRISTOPHER: Yes I do.
ANDREW: [whispering] Uh, I'm sorry Christopher, your credit card has been rejected.
CHRISTOPHER: Rejected? What are you talking about?
ANDREW: I could run it through again if you'd like.
RORY: Yes.
CHRISTOPHER: Uh, no. He doesn't need to run it throug hagain.
RORY: Oh, ok.
CHRISTOPHER: Could you maybe hold that for us? I'll come back tomorrow with another card.
ANDREW: Sure Chris, no problem.
CHRISTOPHER: Thanks. Come on. [they leave the bookstore. Outside] Now you'll really remember me.
RORY: I didn't want it that much anyways.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, listen, don't tell your mom about this ok?
RORY: Ok.
JACKSON: [standing with his back to them talking to a group of people] Yes it is her real dad. He seems very nice. Kind of a folky, poppy, urban, scruffy look to him. And obviously there's some money mixed in there because he's got that you know, money nose. And - [someone clears their throat. Jackson turns around and see Rory and Chris standing there. He touches his touque and runs off. ]
CUT TO LUKE'S
[Lorelai sitting at a table]
LUKE: So Rory was at the game today.
LORELAI: Oh yeah.
LUKE: Yeah she was with some guy.
LORELAI: Dean.
LUKE: No, I know that punk. Some older guy.
LORELAI: Oh, that would've been her dad.
LUKE: Really? So that's uh...
LORELAI: The guy who impregnated me with Rory - yes.
LUKE: Oh, well, he did a good job.
LORELAI: Impregnating me with Rory?
LUKE: Now this has taken a very weird turn.
LORELAI: Yeah.
[Rory and Chris enter]
RORY: Hi.
LORELAI: Oh hi, where were you? [as she kisses Rory]
CHRISTOPHER: Well we saw Al's Paraguayan pancake house, we were stalked by several towns people and apparently I look like Billy Crudup.
LORELAI: You do not.
CHRISTOPHER: Take it up with Jackson. [phone rings]
LORELAI: Ah, ah, ah, ah,. Hey, hey, hey, hey. [points to the no cell phone sign]
CHRISTOPHER: Hello? Emily!
LORELAI: Emily?
CHRISTOPHER: [whispers] It's your mother.
RORY: Hi Grandma!
CHRISTOPHER: Uh-huh [pause] Well actually I'm sitting here with your girls. [pause] Sure. [to Lorelai, handing her the phone] She wants to speak to you.
LORELAI: Mm. Hi mom.
GRANDMA: Lorelai, Christopher's in town!
LORELAI: [gasps] What?! I didn't know! Although coincidently I'm sitting across an amazing Christopher hologram.
GRANDMA: Well I had this wonderful idea. Christopher's parents are in town too. You remember Straub and Francine don't you?
LORELAI: Ah yes - the Schnickelfritzes.
GRANDMA: The who?
LORELAI: The Hayden's.
GRANDMA: Well I called them up and invited them to dinner. They said they are free to join us all on Friday night.
LORELAI: Join us all?
GRANDMA: Yes. You, Rory, Christopher, your father.
LORELAI: That's quite a gathering mom.
GRANDMA: Well I should say so. We haven't all been together since the two of you were children. And Straub and Francine haven't seen Rory since she was a baby.
LORELAI: Yeah I know but -
GRANDMA: It'll be like a wonderful reunion - all of us together again. I never thought it would happen.
LORELAI: Yeah, me either.
CUT TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE
[The three of them standing in front of the door]
LORELAI: [sighs] I've gotta see my parents.
CHRISTOPHER: [sighs] I've gotta see my parents.
RORY: Ladies and gentlemen, the drama king and queen of Connecticut.
[They enter using a key]
LORELAI: Hello? Anybody home?
GRANDMA: Oh my God! You're here. Christopher, look at you!
CHRISTOPHER: Emily, as always perfect.
GRANDMA: I am so glad to see you, I didn't hear the doorbell.
LORELAI: We didn't ring the doorbell.
GRANDMA: You let yourselves in?
LORELAI: It's ok mom, look, not a r*pist among us.
RORY: Hi Grandma.
GRANDMA: You usually knock.
LORELAI: Not since you gave us a key.
GRANDMA: That is for emergencies.
LORELAI: Well mom, I'm starving to death. Is that enough of an emergency for you?
GRANDMA: Well, Richard's in the living room, come on in. He's dying to see you.
LORELAI: [whispers to Chris] It's a setup giving me that key. It's a key, it meant to be used, it's my parents house. Shut up.
CHRISTOPHER: Sorry.
GRANDPA: Well here they are.
RORY: Hi Grandpa.
GRANDPA: Hello Rory. Lorelai. Christopher old boy how are you? My gosh it's good to see you!
CHRISTOPHER: How are you Richard?
GRANDPA: Well I'm better than most, not as good as some.
CHRISTOPHER: And annoyed with all.
GRANDPA: Aha! You speak the truth young man! I have made martini's. So Christopher, tell me about your business.
GRANDMA: Oh Richard, let the poor boy relax.
GRANDPA: Well I simply want to find out how it's going.
CHRISTOPHER: It's uh - it's going great Richard. I'm almost afraid to jinx it by telling you good it's going.
GRANDPA: Oh, that is wonderful. I always knew you had it in you. You have a splash of greatness as my mother would say. You've always had that splash of greatness.
LORELAI: Mm. I'd like another splash of greatness if you don't mind.[getting another martini]
GRANDMA: Oh Richard. Isn't Rory the spitting image of Christopher?
GRANDPA: I just hope you inherit your father's business sense also my dear.
GRANDMA: I know one thing for sure- you certainly have your father's musical talent.
LORELAI: Oh, wait just a minute.
GRANDMA: What?
LORELAI: Mom, neither of these two have any musical talent.
CHRISTOPHER: Hey, I play guitar.
LORELAI: You know the opening lick to Smoke on the Water'.
CHRISTOPHER: And I've since mastered the opening like to Jumping Jack Flash'.
GRANDPA: I'm a...Chuck Berry man myself. [Lorelai laughs almost spitting out her drink] Something wrong?
LORELAI: I would never have guessed that that last sentence would ever come out of your mouth.
GRANDPA: And why not?
LORELAI: Chuck Berry?
GRANDPA: Yes, Chuck Berry. He was all the rage when I was in school.
LORELAI: So we're talking pre-My-ding-aling'?
GRANDPA: I believe I am.
GRANDMA: Do you remember when you two were what - ten and you put on that adorable show for us.
LORELAI: What show mom?
CHRISTOPHER: Lucy, Schroeder, you laying on the coffee table.
LORELAI: You pretending it was a piano. God, why is that remembered?
GRANDMA: Because it was such a wonderful production.
LORELAI: I don't know if it was a production mom. It was just one song.
CHRISTOPHER: Suppertime'.
GRANDMA: Did you write that? That was really very good.
LORELAI: Dad, that's from You're a good man Charlie Brown' It's a famous musical.
GRANDPA: Well I thought Christopher might have written it, he's a very talented man.
[Doorbell]
GRANDMA: That would be Straub and Francine. [leaves to answer the door]
LORELAI: [whispers to Rory] Ha, ha your turn.
GRANDPA: I haven't seen your parents in quite a number of years. We were practically inseparable for a while. [leaves]
CHRISTOPHER: I remember that.
RORY: This is weird. These are my other grandparents. I don't even know them. What do I call them?
CHRISTOPHER: Call'em what I call'em - ass-
LORELAI: Chris...
CHRISTOPHER: Sorry, my tie's too tight.
LORELAI: Just, uh, call them Straub and Francine. Call them Mr and Mrs Hayden. Sir and Ma'am? Why don't you just avoid calling them anything.
GRANDPA: Look who's herre.
CHRISTOPHER: Hello mother, pop.
STRAUB: Christopher.
FRANCINE: Christopher, hello.
LORELAI: Mr and Mrs Hayden, long time no see.
FRANCINE: Lorelai. You look well.
LORELAI: I am thanks. You remember Rory. You haven't seen her in quite a while.
STRAUB: No we haven't.
FRANCINE: I think she was just beginning to speak in complete sentences.
LORELAI: So not for two years then. [Hayden's look at her] She's obviously been talking a long time so I was making a humorous comment sometimes referred to as a joke'.
STRAUB: I see you haven't changed Lorelai.
LORELAI: No, not at all.
FRANCINE: Rory, hello.
RORY: Hi. [she curtsy's]
LORELAI: [whispers] Did you just curtsy?
RORY: [whispers] Shut up.
LORELAI: [whispers] Sorry, milady.
GRANDPA: Uh, Straub, Francine, how about a martini?
STRAUB: Please.
GRANDPA: Well Straub, how is retirement treating you?
GRANDMA: Yes do tell us about the Bahamas.
STRAUB: You can get an entire island there for the cost of a decent house here.
GRANDPA: Really?
STRAUB: How about you Richard, any thoughts of retirement crossing your mind?
GRANDMA: Oh Straub, if only you could talk him into it. I've given up.
GRANDPA: We're very pleased about Christopher's business success out in California.
STRAUB: Yes, it's taken a while but it seems to be finally coming together. Seems to be.
FRANCINE: Christopher your tie, please.
RORY: [clears her throat]Straub and Fran - [clears her throat] Mr. and Mrs. um...are you enjoying your time here, um...you...two?
CHRISTOPHER: [to Lorelai] That she got from you.
STRAUB: How old are you young lady?
RORY: 16.
STRAUB: Dangerous age for girls [Lorelai looks at him]
FRANCINE: Straub.
GRANDMA: Rory is a very special child - excellent student, very bright.
GRANDPA: You should have a talk with her Straub, she could give you a run for your money.
STRAUB: Is that so?
GRANDMA: That's right.
[Straub looks at Rory, Rory looks uncomfortable unsure what to do]
STRAUB: Well I think my money's safe.
LORELAI: I hate president Bush.
STRAUB: What?
GRANDMA: Lorelai...
CHRISTOPHER: Oh boy.
LORELAI: He's stupid and his face is too tiny for his head and I just want to toss him out.
STRAUB: That is the leader of our country young lady.
GRANDPA: Ignore her.
FRANCINE: His face is too tiny for his head, what kind of thing is that to say?
STRAUB: I see your daughter is just as out of control as ever.
CHRISTOPHER: Pop please. Let's try and keep it civil.
STRAUB: Tell me Lorelai, what have you been doing with your life anyway, besides hating successful businessmen. I'm just curious.
GRANDMA: Why don't we all go into the dining room?
LORELAI: Well uh, Straub, I run an inn near Stars Hollow.
STRAUB: Really?
LORELAI: Yes really.
CHRISTOPHER: Dad come on.
STRAUB: Nice to see you found your calling.
GRANDMA: Dinner is ready.
FRANCINE: Christopher your tie.
CHRISTOPHER: Mom please.
STRAUB: And is your life everything you hoped it would be?
LORELAI: Yes it is.
STRAUB: Because it seems to me you might not want to take such a haughty tone when you announce to the world that you work in a hotel.
LORELAI: Well there's nothing wrong with where I work.
FRANCINE: Straub please. I'm getting a headache.
GRANDMA: Come on Richard, lead us into the dining room, now.
STRAUB: If you had attended a university as your parents had planned and as we planned in vain for Christopher, you might have aspired to something more than a blue collared position.
CHRISTOPHER: Don't do this.
STRAUB: And I wouldn't give a damn about you derailing your life if you hadn't swept my son along with you.
LORELAI: [to Rory] Honey go into the next room. Go, go.
GRANDPA: I'm going to have to echo Christopher's call for civility here. A mutual mistake was make many years ago by these two, but they have come a long way since.
STRAUB: A mutual mistake Richard? This whole evening is ridiculous. We're supposed to sit here like one big happy family and pretend that the damage that was done is over, gone? I don't care about how good a student you say that girl is...
LORELAI: Hey!
STRAUB: Our son was bound for Princeton. Every Hayden male attended Princeton including myself, but it all stopped with Christopher. It's a humiliation we've had to live with every day, all because you seduced him into ruining his life. She had that baby and ended his future.
GRANDPA: [grabbing Straub's arm] You recant that Straub!
STRAUB: You're spilling my drink.
GRANDPA: You owe my daughter an apology.
STRAUB: An apology, that's rich.
GRANDPA: How dare you?! [grabbing Straub] How dare you?!
GRANDMA: Richard what are you doing?
GRANDPA: How dare you come into my house and insult my daughter!
STRAUB: Let go of me!
CHRISTOPHER: Whoa, whoa, what is going on here? [putting himself between them]
GRANDPA: Shame on you Straub, shame on you for opening all this up again.
STRAUB: Get your purse Francine.
GRANDPA: My daughter is very successful at what she does.
STRAUB: We're leaving.
GRANDPA: You're not leaving. I'm kicking you out. [All four leave the room. Lorelai and Christopher and standing in the middle]
CHRISTOPHER: And you brought up Bush because?
LORELAI: It seemed like a good idea at the time. Wow.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah.
LORELAI: I feel...16.
[Pan to study. Richard sitting reading. Lorelai enters]
LORELAI: Dad? Dad...can I get you something to eat?
GRANDPA: I'm not hungry.
LORELAI: Ok. Well look, thank you.
GRANDPA: Thank me? For what? [Lorelai turns back.]
LORELAI: Well for what you did in there. I'm...I'm just unbelievably touched and grateful for what you said to him, for defending me like that. I know it was hard for you because, well...but thank you. [starts to leave]
GRANDPA: Why do you think I did it? [Lorelai turns back.]
LORELAI: What?
GRANDPA: Why do you think I did it?
LORELAI: I don't know. Um, out of protectiveness I guess.
GRANDPA: You don't need to be protected Lorelai. You've made it very clear that you can look after yourself and that you need nothing from anyone.
LORELAI: Mm. That's not...
GRANDPA: A member of my family was being attacked. The very Gilmore name was being attacked. I will not stand for that not under any circumstances.
LORELAI: Ok, well it doesn't really matter why you did it.
GRANDPA: Yes it does matter why I did it! It matters greatly! Lorelai what are you going to take away from this? That everything that happened in the past is suddenly fine because I defended you?
LORELAI: No.
GRANDMA: That the hell that you put your mother and I through for the past 16 years is suddenly washed away? Well it's not.
LORELAI: We've all been through hell dad.
GRANDPA: I had to tell my friends, my colleagues, that my only daughter, the brightest in her class, was pregnant and was leaving school.
LORELAI: That must have been devastating.
GRANDPA: And then you run away and treat us like lepers. Your mother couldn't get out of bed for a month. Did you know that? Did you?
LORELAI: No.
GRANDPA: We did nothing to deserve that. Nothing to earn that!
LORELAI: I get it. I'm horrible. So why don't you disown me and adopt Christopher, you love him.
GRANDPA: Don't be a martyr Lorelai. And don't be naïve. Do you think I love the boy who got my daughter pregnant? I wanted to k*ll him! I would have too with my bare hands. But there's a proper procedure to be followed in a situation like this.
LORELAI: Marriage.
GRANDPA: Christopher was willing to follow the procedure we laid out, you weren't.
LORELAI: What about what I wanted Dad? Didn't that matter to you at all?
GRANDPA: Sometimes one has to sacrifice something in order to do what is right.
LORELAI: I feel indescribably sad for you right now, dad.
GRANDPA: Well save your emotions Lorelai. I've had my fill of them tonight.
LORELAI: So, um, we just end it here. Nothing...resolved?
GRANDPA: I'm tired.
LORELAI: Ok. Ok [leaves]
[Pan to kitchen]
GRANDMA: There you are. I was wondering where you went.
RORY: I'm sorry.
GRANDMA: No, it's nothing to be sorry about. Can I get you something?
RORY: [holding up a pop can] I'm fine.
GRANDMA: Oh that's hardly dinner. Well that was quite a bit of excitement tonight.
RORY: Oh yeah.
GRANDMA: Not the good kind.
RORY: Nope.
GRANDMA: None of this means anything Rory.
RORY: Oh I know.
GRANDMA: Straub is actually a good man. Very smart. He was one of the top lawyers in his field - a very arcane aspect of International law. And he's always been so active in his community. His charity work has never diminished over the years. Oh let's face it - he's a big ass. [Rory laughs] Rory, I know you heard a lot of talk about various disappointments this evening and I know you've heard a lot of talk about it in the past. But I want to make this very clear - you, young lady, your person and your existance have never ever been - not even for a second -included in that list. Do you understand me?
RORY: Yeah, I do.
GRANDMA: Good now eat up. [hands her a plate of leftovers]
[Pan to balcony outside Lorelai's old room. Lorelai sitting crying.]
CHRISTOPHER: You look great [coming out onto the balcony.]
LORELAI: Yeah, well, I look the way I feel wiseguy.
CHRISTOPHER: That was...that was a memorable evening.
LORELAI: Oh yes, it was beautiful in there. We should commemorate it with an oil painting or a severed head or something.
CHRISTOPHER: Next time we get this group together we're gonna have to frisk for w*apon.
LORELAI: Hand out gags.
CHRISTOPHER: Employ six individual cones of silence [Lorelai laughs] Boy the old balcony is still the same isn't it?
LORELAI: In all it's beautiful away-from-them-ness.
CHRISTOPHER: Perfect hide-out - totally private. We spent a lot of time out here.
LORELAI: Sneaking dad's telescope, scanning the sky for alien ships.
CHRISTOPHER: Never found any.
LORELAI: Huh. And then when we were older, scanning the neighbors houses for naked people.
CHRISTOPHER: [laughing] Found a couple of those.
LORELAI: [laughing] Mrs. Dominski undulating in her big fat underalls is forever carved into my brain.
CHRISTOPHER: [laughing] And in mine. [takes out a tequila bottle] here's to Mrs. Dominski's underalls.
LORELAI: Aw, you're holding out on me.
CHRISTOPHER: [takes a drink] Take it. And in an effort to further chronicle this balcony's history, we are now in the immediate vicinity of the spot upon which was Rory's initial eminations.
LORELAI: Yes we are. Here's to Rory. [takes a drink]
CHRISTOPHER: The bright spot in all the darkness.
LORELAI: And now.
CHRISTOPHER: You know even if you hadn't gotten pregnant and everything had gone as planned, I still never would have make it through Princeton.
LORELAI: Oh I don't believe that.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, well that's why you're you and I'm not.
[Pan to Luke's where Luke is waiting for Lorelai. He gives up and goes inside. Pan back to the balcony where Christopher and Lorelai are kissing as they take off each other's clothes. Pan to them putting back on their clothes.]
LORELAI: Wow. Wow, wow, wow.
CHRISTOPHER: You wigged?
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah I'm a little wigged.
CHRISTOPHER: Why?
LORELAI: Why? Are you kidding me? Chris this is the next to last thing I thought would ever happen tonight. The last thing being a holy saint guy riding down on a flaming chariot from heaven to announce Armageddon.
CHRISTOPHER: And Hartford is the place he chooses to make his announcement? I don't think so.
LORELAI: Christopher.
CHRISTOPHER: Ok, yes, it was unexpected but it was great.
LORELAI: Oh God! Oh I can't believe this.
CHRISTOPHER: Ok fine. You know what? We should go.
LORELAI: Yeah we should go like 30 minutes ago.
CHRISTOPHER: [sighs] I'm sorry.
LORELAI: Oh don't apologize. It was the both of us. [they leave] God my parents have got to seal these windows up I swear to God.



CUT TO INSIDE CAR
RORY: So where were you guys?
LORELAI: Nowhere.
RORY: Where's nowhere?
CHRISTOPHER: Where we were.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm.
RORY: Ah.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
CHRISTOPHER: Night you.
RORY: Good night dad. [he gives her a kiss]
CHRISTOPHER: Good night Lor.
LORELAI: Good night, yeah, uh, have a really, really good night. [he heads for the couch]
RORY: You got some dirt or some schmuts on your -
LORELAI: Hmm?
RORY: Where did you -
LORELAI: I don't - it's been a long night so um, there's just been a lot of schmutsing going on.
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: Come on [directing her to the kitchen] We haven't really had a chance to talk.
RORY: About the schmutsing?
LORELAI: [sighs] No, about all the warm and fuzzy family moments that went on tonight. Are you ok?
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: You know all those crazy people saying those horrible things were directing them at me not you.
RORY: They were directing them to you because you had me.
LORELAI: No, they were directing them at me because I screwed up their big Citizen Kane' plans. That's all.
RORY: They don't even want to know me do they?
LORELAI: That is not true. They are just so full of anger and stupid pride that stands in the way of them realizing how much they want to know you.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Their loss and it's a pretty big one.
RORY: I'm going to bed now.
LORELAI: Hey. No regrets - from me or your dad.
RORY: Yeah?
LORELAI: Oh, I mean no regrets about you. There's a misspelled tattoo incident that I'm sure he'd like to erase from his bio - but you that's a no brainer.
RORY: Where does dad have a misspelled tattoo?
LORELAI: Ah, ah, another story for another time, possibly before your first trip to Mazatlan. Good night babe.
RORY: Good night mom.
LORELAI: [walks by a mirror and looks at herself] Ugh.
[Pan to morning. Lorelai awake in bed]
LORELAI: [gasps] Oh no! Aah!
CUT TO LUKE'S
[Lorelai waiting in pj's on the front stoop]
LORELAI: I feel horrible.
LUKE: Don't.
LORELAI: I stood you up and I didn't even call.
LUKE: It's ok.
LORELAI: I'm a rat. We had a date and I stood you up.
LUKE: It wasn't a date, it was just a paint.
LORELAI: I'm a rat, I need cheese.
LUKE: Forget it.
LORELAI: Hey, hey, let's reschedule.
LUKE: You know, I really didn't even want to do it in the first place.
LORELAI: No, no come on, don't change your mind. We could do it tonight or - or right now.
LUKE: Was it an emergency?
LORELAI: Yes. You would not believe what happened. I slipped and I busted my - it wasn't an emergency. It was just me being a rat.
LUKE: Something came up?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: Something...someone.
LORELAI: Luke.
LUKE: Am I right?
LORELAI: I'm sorry.
LUKE: Yeah, ok. Well I'm late.
LORELAI: Oh.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
[Christopher making coffee as Lorelai comes in.]
CHRISTOPHER: Where were you?
LORELAI: Fruitlessly trying to rectify a ratty transgression.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh. You want some coffee?
LORELAI: No.
CHRISTOPHER: What?
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: Well I know you well enough to know that when you say no to coffee, especially in the morning, all is not right in Whoville.
LORELAI: Very astute.
CHRISTOPHER: So...last night.
LORELAI: Ah, last night was Chernobyl and the Hindenburg combined.
CHRISTOPHER: Right, just checking.
LORELAI: My father almost hit someone. My father has probably only hit another man in college wearing boxing gloves and one of those Fred Mertz golden gloves pullover sweaters.
CHRISTOPHER: Fred Mertz?
LORELAI: I Love Lucy' - Fred Mertz.
CHRISTOPHER: Landlord to Ricki, husband to Ethel, I know. It's just a weird reference.
LORELAI: Hello, pajamas.
CHRISTOPHER: Right. Continue.
LORELAI: My father had a meltdown, first with your father...
CHRISTOPHER: He was asking for it.
LORELAI: ...and then with me. And then you and me - oh boy.
CHRISTOPHER: Don't say it like that.
LORELAI: Stupid. Dumb.
CHRISTOPHER: Much better.
LORELAI: And to top off the whole fabulous fiasco, I stood up a friend of mine, who was counting on me and, and he just stood there looking hurt with the paint and the chairs and it hurt me. And it's not your fault but in this parade of stupid and dumb, I am the one twirling the flaming baton.
CHRISTOPHER: Lor?
LORELAI: What?
CHRISTOPHER: I want to marry you.
LORELAI: And the hits just keep on coming.
CHRISTOPHER: Just think about it. Think about it before you make a rash -
LORELAI: You are out of your mind. You are completely insane. You have flipped your lid. Charlie Manson is freaked out by you right now!
CHRISTOPHER: Come on, we're already a family.
LORELAI: Who? Who is a family?!
CHRISTOPHER: Us! You, me and Rory!
LORELAI: You don't even know what a family is.
CHRISTOPHER: It's people living together.
LORELAI: No. It's a big commitment, it's responsibility, it's hard work. It's coming home at the same time to the same place every day.
CHRISTOPHER: Ok, so what do you want, financial statements? I can be a family man, I'm responsible.
LORELAI: Honey, you can't even buy a book without having your credit card declined.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh man, I told Rory not to rat me out. I can't believe she did that.
LORELAI: She didn't. Andrew from the bookstore called and Jackson and the UPS guy and ooh it was the lead story on the Stars Hollow web page. And then I asked Rory and she very reluctantly confirmed it. Rat me out' what are you - 16?
CHRISTOPHER: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: And what are you doing telling my daughter to lie to me anyway?
CHRISTOPHER: She's my daughter too.
LORELAI: More like your playmate.
CHRISTOPHER: You know I don't deserve that, I'm as mature as you.
LORELAI: What? The offspring is your favorite band.
CHRISTOPHER: So? You're into Metallica.
LORELAI: Well Metallica is way more substantial than The Offspring.
CHRISTOPHER: Here we go, it's the same Black Sabbath riff all over again.
LORELAI: Oh! The Offspring have like one chord compression. They use it over and over. They just popped on new words and called it a single and I don't want to talk about this anymore!
CHRISTOPHER: Look, I'm the immature one, I'm the irresponsible one, I'm was the one who was willing to get married when you got pregnant.
LORELAI: We were too young, we wouldn't have made it, you know that.
CHRISTOPHER: Well we're not too young now.
LORELAI: Ok. Now I need some coffee.
CHRISTOPHER: What about last night. What did our having sex mean to you?
LORELAI: [sighs] It meant that Jose Cuervo still has amazing magical powers.
CHRISTOPHER: You're funny.
LORELAI: We can't get married Christopher. We don't know each other as adults.
CHRISTOPHER: So let's get married and get to know each other as adults.
LORELAI: Well, that's very Fiddler on the Roof of you.
CHRISTOPHER: Ok, fine. Let's get to know each other right now. What do you want to know?
LORELAI: How is your business really doing? [Christopher sighs]
CHRISTOPHER: Lorelai.
LORELAI: I knew it.
CHRISTOPHER: Look, I was going to tell you if it didn't pick up soon. I swear.
LORELAI: And you just sat there last night, just smiling and nodding while my dad and your dad went on and on about Christopher and his great big business success in California.
CHRISTOPHER: Yeah, I didn't want to upset anybody. I wanted last night to be nice.
LORELAI: Oh well it was.
CHRISTOPHER: Oh and it would have been much better if I had announced at the table Hey on top of everything else you're upset about, I just wanted to add that I'm the biggest loser in the world'. Would that have been festive?
LORELAI: You're not a loser.
CHRISTOPHER: Please.
LORELAI: You're a liar but not a loser.
CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
CHRISTOPHER: Come on ,we're arguing like an old married couple. Doesn't that show potential?
LORELAI: Oh Christopher, I swear to God...
CHRISTOPHER: I've been looking for the one Lor, that elusive soul mate - I really have, I just believe it's you, it's always been you.
LORELAI: Chris come on.
CHRISTOPHER: Rory might be my only child.
LORELAI: That's not true. If Tony Randall can crank one out in his seventies you have decades left to spawn.
CHRISTOPHER: No. I don't know how much I miss Rory until I see her like this. It's...it's easier staying away.
LORELAI: No. Don't stay away. Don't. Rory needs her dad.
CHRISTOPHER: Or her pal right?
LORELAI: I think she'd take a combo.
[Pan to outside house, Christopher loading up bike]
RORY: So call us when you get home.
CHRISTOPHER: I will.
RORY: And call more.
CHRISTOPHER: I will. [they hug] See ya. [ he whispers something in her ear]
RORY: [to Lorelai] Dad wants to know if you'll reconsider.
[Lorelai calls Rory over and whispers in her ear]
RORY: She says Nope. Offspring sucks and Metallica rules.'
CHRISTOPHER: Fair enough. [He kisses and hugs Lorelai]
LORELAI: Drive safe. [He leaves]
RORY: He wanted you to marry him didn't he?
LORELAI: Spy.
RORY: You know crazier things have happened.
LORELAI: You mean crazier than having your mom and dad married?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: I don't think they have.
RORY: What? Why is that so crazy?
LORELAI: Because it is. Because he wants things he is not ready for.
RORY: How do you know?
LORELAI: I know. I know him so well. You have no idea.
RORY: Maybe he can change.
LORELAI: Rory.
RORY: Maybe it's different. He did come here this time, he's never done that before.
LORELAI: Hey, stop.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Because I don't want you to get yourself all worked up over this.
RORY: He loves you.
LORELAI: He does love me.
RORY: Do you love him?
LORELAI: Honey come on.
RORY: Answer me.
LORELAI: Honestly?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: I will probably always love him.
RORY: Ok so?
LORELAI: But that doesn't change the fact that he still has a long way to go before he is ready to take us on full time. I mean you are a handful missy. And while I am pure joy and sunshine every waking hour, I still have my own set of needs that - that must be met. It just wasn't right babe. You have to trust me on that. Mm? Talk please.
RORY: I still think there was a little something different.
LORELAI: Maybe you're right.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: It would be nice.
RORY: Yeah it would
LORELAI: I'll tell you what, uh, let's not put all the blankets away just yet.
RORY: Really?
LORELAI: You never know.
CUT TO LUKE'S
LUKE: What the -
LORELAI: Taa-daa!
LUKE: How'd you get in here?
LORELAI: You're bread guy let me in.
LUKE: I'm switching bread guys.
LORELAI: What do you think?
LUKE: I think you shouldn't break and enter.
LORELAI: So what do you think?
LUKE: Well I gotta admit - it looks pretty good.
LORELAI: Oh, I knew you'd like it.
LUKE: Thanks.
LORELAI: Anytime. It's fun.
LUKE: So, uh, where's the guy?
LORELAI: Oh he's gone.
LUKE: Oh, too bad.
LORELAI: We'll be fine. Luke?
LUKE: Yeah?
LORELAI: Um, can I make one more suggestion?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Curtains?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: Manly curtains.
LUKE: Oxymoron.
LORELAI: What did you call me?
LUKE: No curtains.
LORELAI: Aw come on. You gotta give a little. How about a tablecloth?
LUKE: No. We don't do table cloths here.

OPEN IN STARS HOLLOW
(Miss Patty narrates a story in the background as the camera pans around town as locals prepare for a festival.)
MISS PATTY: This, boys and girls, is the story of true love. A beautiful girl from one county; a handsome boy from another. They meet and they fall in love. Separated by distance and by parents who did not approve of the union, the young couple dreamed of a day that they could be together. They wrote each other beautiful letters. Letters of longing and passion. Letters full of promises and plans for the future. Soon the separation proved too much for either one of them to bear. So, one night, cold and black with no light to guide them, they both snuck out of their homes and ran away as fast as they could. It was so dark out that they were both soon lost and it seemed as if they would never find each other. Finally, the girl dropped to her knees, tears streaming down her lovely face. 'Oh, my love. Where are you? How will I find you?' Suddenly, a band of stars appeared in the sky. These stars shone so brightly they lit up the entire countryside. The girl jumped to her feet and followed the path of the stars until finally she found herself standing right where the town gazebo is today. And there waiting for her was her one true love, who had also been led here by the blanket of friendly stars. [Camera stops on Miss Patty's dance studio, where she is telling the story to a group of children.] And that, my friends, is the story of how Stars Hollow came to be, and why we celebrate that fateful night every year at about this time. Now, we still have a little time left in our story hour. Who wants to hear about the time I danced in a cage for Tito Puente?
KIDS: [raising hands] Me!
MISS PATTY: It was the summer of 66..
(Opening Credits)
CUT TO BUS STOP
(Dean is waiting on the bench as Rory steps off the bus.)
RORY: So?
DEAN: It's depressing.
RORY: It's beautiful.
DEAN: She throws herself under a train.
RORY: But I bet she looked great doing it.
DEAN: I don't know. I think maybe Tolstoy's just a little over my head.
RORY: No, that's not true. Tolstoy wrote for the masses, the common man. It's completely untrue that you have to be some kind of genius to read his stuff.
DEAN: Yeah but
RORY: Now I know it's big. . .
DEAN: Very big.
RORY: And long. . .
DEAN: Very, very long
RORY: And many of the Russian names tend be spelled very similar, making it confusing
DEAN: Every single person's name ends with 'ski'. Now how is that possible?
RORY: But it's one of my favorite books. And I know that if you just give it a try you...
DEAN: All right. I'll try again.
RORY: Really?
DEAN: Yeah.
RORY: You won't be sorry.
DEAN: Coffee?
RORY: Please.
DEAN: Man, I thought Christmas was a big deal around here.
RORY: Well, this is a town that likes the celebrating. Last year we had a month long carnival when we finally got off the septic t*nk system.
DEAN: A month long? You're kidding.
RORY: No. There were rides and a petting zoo and balloon animals and a freak show.
DEAN: Uh huh. Okay, you almost had me going there for a second.
RORY: Well we did have a ribbon cutting ceremony.
DEAN: So what are you doing Friday night?
RORY: Well, I've got the usual Friday night grandparents' dinner. But I thought maybe if we get back early enough you and I should go watch the bonfire together. I mean, it's kind of corny, but it's really pretty. And they sell star-shaped hot dogs.
DEAN: How about if you get out of dinner at your grandparents' this week?
RORY: I don't think so.
DEAN: Well, what if it's for a really special occasion?
RORY: Well, that special occasion better include my being relocated to a plastic bubble if my grandmother's gonna let me out of dinner.
DEAN: There must be some other excuse that you could use.
RORY: Like what?
DEAN: Like it's your three-month anniversary with your boyfriend.
RORY: It is?
DEAN: Yeah. Three months from your birthday. I mean, that's when I gave you the bracelet and that's when I figured this whole thing kinda started.
RORY: Wow. Three months.
DEAN: Actually, technically your birthday was on a Saturday, so really it should be Saturday, but I work Saturday and I planned out this whole big thing so I thought maybe we could do it on Friday.
RORY: What whole big thing?
DEAN: Just this once. Miss dinner. Please. Don't make me throw myself under a train.
RORY: I'll see what I can do.
DEAN: Thank you.
RORY: You're welcome. It's our three-month anniversary.
DEAN: Yeah it is.
RORY: I feel kind of stupid that I didn't even know about this.
DEAN: That's quite all right.
RORY: I mean, I feel really bad that I missed our two-month anniversary.
DEAN: Quite all right too.
RORY: How was it?
DEAN: Pretty good.
RORY: I'm glad.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Lorelai is sitting at the kitchen table reading a box of Hamburger Helper. Rory walks in.)
RORY: No, put that away.
LORELAI: I wanna cook.
RORY: You can make soup.
LORELAI: No. I wanna really cook like on the Food Channel. I wanna sauté thing and chop things and do the BAM, and I wanna arrange things on a plate so they look like a pretty little hat. I wanna be the Iron Chef!
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Yeah, I'll help.
L: Okay. I need a pan.
R: And a fire extinguisher.
L: Funny, funny girl. Now, if I had only bought some hamburger.
R: You didn't buy hamburger?
L: Yes I bought hamburger. I just like saying things like that so you look at me like I'm crazy.
R: So, tell me, why the sudden need to be domestic?
L: Ah, I don't know. I'm in like a funky mood.
R: Why?
L: Too many stars, too much love, it makes me cranky.
R: I take it you haven't heard from Mr. Medina?
L: Hmm, no. I haven't.
R: Maybe that's why you're cranky.
L: Okay, new subject please.
R: You know, you have a phone also.
L: How's it coming with that pan?
R: Cleopatra, queen of denial.
L: The pan, Chucky. Please.
R: Okay fine. New topic.
L: Thank you.
R: I have this huge favor to ask you.
L: Oh, something I can hold over your head. Let's hear it.
R: Friday night is Dean's and my three-month anniversary.
L: Three months? Wow.
R: And Dean apparently has some big fancy evening planned for us.
L: Very classy of him.
R: Yes it is. But for me to actually partake of the foresaid fancy evening, I have to get out of Friday night dinner.
L: Ah.
R: Yeah.
L: Good luck with that.
R: Mom!
L: Do you know how much Emily Gilmore will not care about your three-month anniversary?
R: I was thinking you could talk to her.
L: If there was a runoff between what Emily Gilmore would care about less, a two-for-one toilet paper sale at Costco or your three month anniversary, your anniversary would win, hands down.
R: So you're not even gonna try to help me?
L: Oh no, I'm gonna try to help you, because I care. Emily Gilmore, however. .
R: Phone please.
L: Okay. [Lorelai walks over to the phone. She laughs.]
R: What?
L: Nothing. It's just, 'Oh, hey Mom, uh, Rory and Dean are having their three month anniversary on Friday.' 'Really Lorelai? Why that's wonderful. I'm thrilled.'
R: Stop.
L: 'Three months. Well, woohoo. Hold on, I'm going to cartwheel.'
R: Forget it.
L: Oh, no wait. She's telling my dad now. Why, I think they're cabbage patching.
R: That's it. Find your own pan.
EMILY: Hello?
L: Mom?
EMILY: Lorelai?
L: Uh, yes, hi.
EMILY: Hello.
L: Hi. How are you doing?
EMILY: I'm doing fine.
L: That's good.
EMILY: I'm pleased.
L: How's Dad?
EMILY: What do you want Lorelai?
L: Um, I was just calling to say hello.
EMILY: And now you have.
L: Okay, good.
EMILY: Was there anything else that you wanted to add to that hello?
L: Well, as a matter of fact, there is.
EMILY: Ah ha.
L: Um, you know Rory.
EMILY: Yes, I believe I do.
L: She wanted to say hello too.
EMILY: Lorelai, I'm late for a meeting. I'd love to know why.
L: Mom, just hear me out, okay, and don't say anything. Um, see Friday night is Rory and Dean's three-month anniversary, and while that might not seem like a very big deal to you, it is to them. And I'm gonna ask you to do something you are so not gonna wanna do. But I am begging you to look at it from her point of view and maybe, just maybe let her, just this once, not come to dinner on Friday.
EMILY: All right.
L: What?
EMILY: Since this is a special occasion, I suppose it would be fine if Rory missed dinner on Friday.
L: It would?
EMILY: Yes
R: Mom?
L: Are you sure?
EMILY: I believe I am.
L: No arguments?
EMILY: No.
L: Well, she wont be there.
EMILY: I understand.
L: At all.
EMILY: I heard.
L: All night long.
EMILY: I assumed as much.
L: Okay.
EMILY: Okay.
L: All right.
EMILY: Anything else?
L: Uh, you know, she's gonna need some help getting ready for the big night Mom, so I should probably.
EMILY: We'll see you at seven.
L: Okay. Right. Bye.
R: So?
L: The world is officially coming to an end.
CUT TO CHILTON
(Tristin and Summer are kissing in front of some lockers.)
MADELINE: And they're off.
PARIS: The bell just rang three seconds ago. How did they get lip locked so fast?
MADELINE: I want a boyfriend to make out with.
LOUISE: Ty Tolson likes you.
MADELINE: I want to different boyfriend to make out with.
PARIS: I can't get to my locker.
LOUISE: I'm sure they'll move if you ask nice. You know, dangle a hotel key in front of their faces.
PARIS: This is a school. You don't do this in a school.
LOUISE: Not unless you've got a boyfriend like Tristin. Then you do it anywhere you can.
MADELINE: Street corner.
LOUISE: Shopping mall.
MADELINE: Phone booth.
LOUISE: Starbucks.
PARIS: Thank you for the "where to make out" list, I just need to get my books.
LOUISE: Hell hath no fury.
PARIS: [walks over to her locker] Excuse me. You're in my way. Hey, spawn in front of somebody else's locker please.
RORY: I'm assuming your locker's in there somewhere also.
PARIS: Yup. Right behind Belle Watling.
RORY: Have you tried to get their attention?
PARIS: Sure have.
RORY: No luck?
PARIS: Nope.
RORY: God, look at that. It's like he's eating her face.
PARIS: Okay, that's it. I'm getting the fire hose.
RORY: Let me try first. Hey, could you two just move this whole thing down to the left a little?
TRISTIN: What?
RORY: You're standing in front of the lockers.
PARIS: Our lockers.
TRISTIN: Oh sorry. Just got a little carried away.
RORY: Right.
TRISTIN: Hey Paris.
PARIS: Hey.
SUMMER: You should get bangs.
PARIS: Thanks for the tip.
SUMMER: You have a long forehead. Bangs would hide that.
MADELINE: Hey, party at my house Saturday.
LOUISE: Dress to impress please.
MADELINE: Come? (hands flyer to Rory)
RORY: Oh, I don't know.
MADELINE: You can bring your boyfriend.
RORY: I'll see.
SUMMER: So, meet me after biology?
TRISTIN: And if I don't?
SUMMER: You will.
TRISTIN: Oh, yes I will. Ah. To be young and in love.
PARIS: What a shame Elizabeth Barrett Browning wasn't here to witness this. She'd put her head through a wall.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
(Lorelai walks through the lobby into the kitchen where Jackson and Sookie are kissing.)
LORELAI: Oh, now people, this is a kitchen. At least wear some hairnets.
SOOKIE: Lorelai, hello. Uh, we were, uh. . .
JACKSON: Just discussing jam making.
SOOKIE: Jackson's gonna start making jam and preserves.
JACKSON: Maybe tomato sauce.
SOOKIE: Yeah, there's a whole world out there beyond growing vegetables.
LORELAI: No coffee?
SOOKIE: Sorry.
LORELAI: That's okay. Resume smooching.
SOOKIE: Thank you.
CUT TO INN LOBBY
(Michel talking on phone)
MICHEL: No cherie. I can't wait either. Very soon. You are? Ohhh. Don't tease me. I promise all this waiting will be worthwhile. I'll see you then. Goodbye darling.
LORELAI: So how's mom?
MICHEL: And while normally I would look forward to a good verbal sparring match, today I say no. My heart is light, the world is fine and I have a date for Saturday night. Your turn.
LORELAI: What I need now is lots and lots of coffee.
CUT TO CENTER OF TOWN
(Lorelai walking through Stars Hollow while locals prepare for the festival.)
MAN: Heads up!
(A large papier mache star falls in front of Lorelai)
LORELAI: Agh!
MAN: Hey, you okay?
LORELAI: Yeah, I'm fine.
MAN: Man, that has never happened before!
LORELAI: Really? How about that.
CUT TO LUKE'S
(Lorelai walks in and sits at the counter.)
LORELAI: I was almost crushed by a papier mache star. How's your day?
LUKE: Well, it's looking pretty good now.
LORELAI: Coffee please, no sh*t of cynicism.
LUKE: So, why so cheery?
LORELAI: I don't know. I'm just in a mood. I don't know why.
LUKE: But there's no particular reason for this mood?
LORELAI: No.
LUKE: Uh huh.
LORELAI: You don't believe me?
LUKE: No, I believe you. If you say there's no reason for the mood, then there's no reason for the mood. You're simply nuts.
LORELAI: Or bipolar. That's very big nowadays.
(Miss Patty and Taylor are arguing at a table behind Lorelai.)
TAYLOR: No, no, Patty, you're wrong. They built the fire to throw themselves on it when their families found them
MISS PATTY: Taylor you're crazy! They built the fire so that they could stay warm their first night here.
TAYLOR: Patty, I am the recording secretary for the Stars Hollow City Council, I think I know how my town was founded!
LORELAI: Ugh, can nobody talk about anything else but this stupid festival? [pause] That came out a lot louder then it was supposed to, didn't it?
LUKE: Yup.
LORELAI: Yup.
TAYLOR: This festival is commemorating the founding of our town, young lady.
LORELAI: I know Taylor. I'm sorry.
LUKE: She's bipolar.
MISS PATTY: Really? But you're so young.
LUKE: Uh, can I get you two anything else?
MISS PATTY: Oh, no thank you, sweetheart.
LORELAI: I don't know what is wrong with me. This is a beautiful festival. People should be enjoying it.
LUKE: It's a crazy festival based on a nutty myth about two lunatics, who in all probability did not even exist. And even if they did, probably dropped dead of diphtheria before age 24. The town of Stars Hollow probably got its name from the local dance hall prostitute. Two rich drunk guys who made up the story to make it look good on a poster.
LORELAI: You are full of hate and loathing, and I gotta tell you, I love it!
LUKE: Oh, it's so good to have somebody share this hate with.
LORELAI: My pleasure.
LUKE: More coffee?
LORELAI: Yeah please. Hey, tomorrow, if you have time, I'm planning on despising everyone who says 'Hey, how's it going?'
LUKE: You're on.
RACHEL: Hey, how's it going?
LORELAI: Oh, now that' s just too easy.
LUKE: Rachel.
LORELAI: Rachel? Your Rachel? You're Rachel?
RACHEL: Yup. I'm Rachel.
LUKE: What are youI mean, I thought you were in the Congo or Philadelphia or something.
RACHEL: Actually, though very similar to both the Congo and Philadelphia, I was in the Mideast.
LUKE: Oh. Guess that postcard must've gotten lost.
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah, well things pretty crazy over there, not a lot of writing time. But I finished up my assignment, and I flew back to Chicago and I was walking through O'Hare, and I look up and there's a plane leaving for Hartford in like 20 minutes, and all of a sudden, I'm on it.
LUKE: Nice story.
RACHEL: I should have called.
LUKE: No. Youit's fine.
RACHEL: You look good.
LUKE: Thanks. You um, you look, you, you uh look
LORELAI: He thinks you look good too. Right?
LUKE: Right.
LORELAI: And you do.
RACHEL: Thank you.
LORELAI: I'm Lorelai.
LUKE: Oh yeah. She's Lorelai.
LORELAI: I'm Luke's friend.
LUKE: Yeah. She uh, uh, works at the Independence Inn.
LORELAI: I run it, actually.
LUKE: Sorry, she runs it.
RACHEL: Wow, I love that place.
LORELAI: Oh!
RACHEL: That must be a pretty big job.
LORELAI: It is! It's crazy. There's always something happening. Like, we just put these coffee makers in all the rooms, but only half of them work. They just like shake and gurgle, like they're having some kind of a fit. Why were you in the Mideast?
RACHEL: I was doing a photo story, on how Palestinian and Israeli families have been affected by the violence.
LORELAI: Uh huh, well, so you understand about the job pressure.
RACHEL: Yeah.
LORELAI: I'm gonna go.
RACHEL: Please, don't let me drive you away.
LORELAI: That's okay, you're not. I have to go sit in a closet or something. So, it was really nice to meet you.
RACHEL: Yeah, you too.
LORELAI: Okay, bye. (Lorelai leaves)
RACHEL: So. . .hi.
LUKE: Hi.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Lorelai is combing Rory's hair in Rory's bedroom.)
LORELAI: 'Oh, we got new coffee makers.' Ugh! What was I thinking?
RORY: Well, you spent a lot of time picking out those coffee makers.
L: Oh yeah, I'm Mrs. Coffee.
R: Ow! Okay, I'm still attached to the head.
L: Okay, sorry. I'm a little worked up.
R: Mom, it just Luke's ex-girlfriend.
L: I know. I just hate that I made myself look so stupid in front of
R: Luke?
L: No, Rachel. She was standing there, fresh off a plane, and she had no plane hair at all might I add.
R: And what exactly is plane hair?
L: You know, it's all big and allbah.
R: Got it.
L: And he's staring at her like she's Miss September and she's looking at him like he's Johnny Depp, and I was just babbling like a moron, what is wrong with me?!
R: Ow! Ow! Okay, you are now officially off hair duty.
L: Aw, I'm sorry. I just
R: No, it's okay. I just think it's a little early for Dean to see me completely bald.
L: Right, that's more a six-month thing.
R: So what's going on with you?
L: I don't know. It's just all this love in the air, you know. I miss Max. There's just been so much going on with your Dad coming home and family stuff and your constant existence
R: Thanks for the love.
L: Any time. So I haven't had a lot of time to focus on it and I miss Max.
R: I know.
L: I had a dream about him the other night.
R: Really? Dirty?
L: No, absolutely not. And when you're 21, I'll tell you the real answer. Anyway, it's put me in a funk since then.
R: I'm sorry.
L: Me too. We could talk about me for years, and believe me, we will. But let's focus on you, the lady of the evening. No hooker reference intended.
R: Glad to hear it.
L: Now, what are you gonna wear with that?
R: Um, you tell me.
L: Uh, where is he taking you?
R: Why?
L: Well, you don't want to clash with the decor. A lady plans ahead.
R: Well, if you must know, he's taking me to Andoloro's.
L: Oh, well isn't that romantic?
R: I know!
L: Wow, it's gonna be just like Lady and the Tramp. You'll share a plate of spaghetti, but it'll just be one long strand, but you won't realize it until you accidentally meet in the middle. And then, he'll push a meatball towards you with his nose, and you'll push it back with your nose, and then you'll bring the meatball home and you'll save it in the refrigerator for years and. . .
R: Mom?
L: Uh, neither. Just wear your coat.
R: Okay.
L: But your flower's just a little smushed.
LANE: (calls from front hallway) Rory?
L: There you go, you're all set.
LANE: Is anyone here?
R: You all right?
L: Oh yeah, you look beautiful. Go.
RORY: Lane?
LANE: Oh my God!
CUT TO FRONT HALLWAY
LANE: I just can't believe it!
RORY: I know!
LANE: I mean, three months, that's like one sixty-fourth of your life!
R: I know!
LANE: I have to stop hanging out with you. I mean, you're just making my life seem too pathetic.
LORELAI: Join the club.
R: Are you going to the festival? 'Cause maybe we could meet you there later.
LANE: Oh yeah, that would be romantic.
R: Lane.
LANE: Yes, I'm going to the festival. And would you like to know why?
L: Uh oh!
LANE: My mother has once again set me up.
R: Another future doctor?
LANE: A future chiropractor. I think she's losing confidence in my prospects.
R: Maybe he'll be nice.
LANE: Oh, it's not just him. We're going with his parents, his grandparents, two sisters, three brothers and at least one maiden aunt.
(A car honks from outside)
R: That's Dean.
LANE: Remember, you have to tell me everything.
R: Okay. You too.
LANE: Oh yeah. After the walking, the silence, the sitting and the 'buh bye', that's when the fun will begin.
R: I wanna know anyhow. Bye Mom.
L: Bye honey, have fun.
R: Okay.
L: Don't forget the meatball.
LANE: The meatball?
L: It's a mother-daughter thing. (Rory leaves)
LANE: So, think I can hang out with you for awhile?
L: Oh, uh, not unless you wanna go to Hartford. Besides didn't anyone ever tell you, it's not polite to keep fifteen prospective Korean in-laws waiting.
LANE: You can run over me on your way out. Maybe my mother wouldn't make me go if I was in the hospital.
L: I wouldn't count on it.
LANE: Yeah, you're right.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Lorelai is on the front porch finishing her coffee. Emily opens the door before Lorelai rings the doorbell.)
EMILY: You're late.
LORELAI: How did you do that?
EMILY: What?
LORELAI: Answer the door before I even rang the bell.
EMILY: I thought I heard something, I came to the door, you were there. Come in please. (Lorelai walks in.)
LORELAI: You thought you heard something?
EMILY: Yes.
L: Mom, that door is like ten feet thick.
EMILY: So?
L: Well, so, it wasn't like I was standing out there with a band of jackals, I was just drinking coffee.
EMILY: Lorelai, what is it that you want to hear? That I was standing by the window, staring out at the driveway, waiting to pounce the moment you arrived.
L: Yes, because believe it or not, that would be less creepy.
EMILY: Get yourself a drink, please.
(Lorelai walks into living room. Richard is on the couch reading the newspaper.)
L: Hey Dad.
RICHARD: Lorelai.
L: Sorry I'm late. I was helping Rory get ready for her big date, and well, you know girls.
RICHARD: Mm hmm.
L: So. . . um, how's work?
RICHARD: Oh, work is fine.
L: Yeah? Good, good. My work's fine too.
RICHARD: Uh huh.
L: Oh God. Mom has gone a little crazy with the figurines here, huh? A little Kathy Bates. Although you probably haven't seen Misery, which is a good thing because Rory couldn't sleep alone for a week after we watched it. That wouldn't be a problem for you because you don't sleep alone anyway. I'm guessing. I don't know what your and mom's sleeping arrangement is. Now I'm wishing I hadn't brought it up because it's such a 'Wow, don't wanna go there' kind of a subject. For me, not for you, because you should definitely go there if youuh, well anyway. Agh!
RICHARD: Oh, what have you done now?
L: Nothing. I just, well, I'm putting the bunny back with his little friends and I just sort of massacred them a little bit, but that's life in the jungle isn't it?
RICHARD: Just sit down, please.
L: Okay, sorry.
RICHARD: Just sit with your hands in your lap.
L: Sorry.
RICHARD: And I'm trying to read, so just be quiet and try not to break anything else
EMILY: So are we having a nice chat?
L: Yeah, we're having a great conversation, me and Morrie.
EMILY: Excuse me?
L: Nothing. Thanks, Mom, for letting Rory out of dinner tonight. She really appreciated it.
EMILY: Well, she deserves to celebrate. A three-month anniversary is a landmark feat at her age. Or at any age for some people.
L: I was gonna get a drink. I'm gonna get right on that.
(doorbell rings)
EMILY: I'll get that. (leaves room)
L: Can I freshen up your drink Dad?
RICHARD: No, thank you. One drink before dinner is quite enough.
L: Right, sorry.
(Emily returns to the room with a man.)
EMILY: I had no idea it was so close!
CHASE: Absolutely, right around the corner.
EMILY: Well, what a small world. Oh, Lorelai, I'd like you to meet Chase Bradford.
L: Hey.
CHASE: Hi.
EMILY: He was just telling me that he actually grew up right around the corner from here.
L: Oh, really?
CHASE: Stone house on the corner.
L: Oh, the one with the Dobermans.
CHASE: That's right. Leopold and Loeb. Though I'm afraid they passed on quite a few years ago.
L: Postmen finally got organized, huh?
EMILY: Uh, Chase, this is my husband, Richard.
RICHARD: How do you do?
CHASE: Fine, Richard, just fine.
EMILY: Uh, please sit down.
RICHARD: Emily, I didn't know we were having company for dinner.
EMILY: Oh well, it was just sort of a spur of the moment thing. Chase's mother and I are in the DAR together and he just moved back to Hatrford, and it just seemed like a nice idea.
L: Yes, very nice.
RICHARD: Uh Chase, can I get you a drink?
CHASE: Scotch neat.
RICHARD: Uh, Glenfiddich?
CHASE: Fine. So Lorelai, your mother's told me all about you.
L: Really?
CHASE: Oh yes. I'm just sorry your daughter couldn't join us for dinner. I adore children.
L: Mom, can I talk to you for a minute?
EMILY: Lorelai, we have company.
L: It'll just take a second, really.
EMILY: But
L: Come on, it'll be fun. Excuse us. We're just gonna have a spur of the moment conversation. (Lorelai guides Emily out of the room.)
EMILY: You're pushing me.
L: Is this a setup?
EMILY: What?
L: Uh, Connecticut Ken in there, is he my invited escort for the evening?
EMILY: Lorelai, his mother is a friend of mine.
L: And?
EMILY: He just moved back here and doesn't know anyone.
L: And?
EMILY: And I thought he might enjoy meeting you.
L: AH HA!
EMILY: Put that finger down!
L: Ah, this is why the Miss Congeniality act when Rory wanted to beg out of dinner.
EMILY: It just seemed like a good opportunity.
L: Mom, thank you for the thought, but I can get my own men.
EMILY: (laughs) Really?
L: Yes, really.
EMILY: I must disagree.
L: You must?
EMILY: Chase is a quality man, he has good breeding, he comes from a nice family. He makes a nice living, he's attractive.
L: Mom, mmm, no.
EMILY: Is it gonna k*ll you to simply keep an open mind about him?
L: Mom, he's not my type.
EMILY: Why not? Because I like him?
L: You know, I swear, I don't know which one, but there is a game show out there with your name on it.
EMILY: Well that must be it because you've hardly said two words to the man. You couldn't possibly hate him already.
L: Oh no, it's that arcade game where the mole keeps sticking his head out and you have to pound him as many times as you can with the mallet. You would be a master at that game.
EMILY: Lorelai, I realize that Chase may not be as controversial as your usual brand of men.
L: They would erect a statue of you next to it with perfect hair and pearls and a big bronze mallet.
EMILY: But I want you to think about something. Tonight your daughter is celebrating her three-month anniversary. What was the last relationship you had that lasted that long? [pause] I thought so.
(Lorelai and Emily return to living room.)
EMILY: Well, here we are. I'm very sorry.
CHASE: Oh, that's all right. I had a chance to tell Richard a little bit about what I do in the actuarial business.
RICHARD: Yes, it's fascinating.
CHASE: Lorelai, may I fix you something to drink?
L: Hmm, gin.
CHASE: And?
L: Gin.
RICHARD: Make that two.
L: What about the one drink before dinner rule?
RICHARD: Well, we have guests. We're celebrating. Chase, here, let me help you with that.



CUT TO ANDOLORO'S
RORY: That was really good.
DEAN: It was?
RORY: Yes it was.
DEAN: How was the salad?
RORY: Great.
DEAN: What about that cheese bread thing? Too heavy?
RORY: Just heavy enough.
DEAN: Really?
RORY: Everything was perfect. Even the soda was good. I don't know how they do it but the Coke here is definitely superior to the Coke anywhere else.
DEAN: Okay, at what point during that did you start making fun of me?
RORY: I would never make fun of you. Especially not after you ordered three different kinds of pasta for me just because I couldn't decide.
DEAN: Well you shouldn't have to decide. I mean, tonight, you should have everything that you want.
RORY: I just have to say that I'm now a very big fan of the three-month anniversary.
DEAN: Oh yeah?
RORY: Definitely. I think they should have T-shirts and newsletters.
DEAN: Well, I'm glad.
RORY: You did all this for me.
DEAN: It's not over yet.
RORY: This is just like that Christmas when I got a full set of illustrated encyclopedias. [Dean gives a confused look] I wanted them.
DEAN: Oh, uh, good
WAITER: One tiramisu, two forks, and uh, one meatball to go.
RORY: Thank you.
DEAN: You wanna explain the meatball?
RORY: It's a mother-daughter thing.
DEAN: Okay. Well, uh ladies first.
RORY: Thank you. [takes a bite] Okay, have I mentioned how much I'm loving the three month anniversary thing?
DEAN: Yeah, you did.
RORY: Because this tiramisu is so good that if the anniversary were completely sucking right now, this would save it. What?
DEAN: Nothing.
RORY: Stop it.
DEAN: No, you look cute.
RORY: I'm eating.
DEAN: Well, you eat cute.
RORY: I do not eat cute. No one eats cute. Bambi maybe, but he's a cartoon.
DEAN: So, uh, after we finish here we move onto phase two of the anniversary evening.
RORY: Phase 2. Sounds very official, are there space suits involved?
DEAN: With matching helmets.
RORY: Impressive.
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Lorelai, Emily, Richard and Chase are eating dinner.)
CHASE: So Lorelai, are you a member of the DAR?
LORELAI: No, I'm not. D-A-R-N. [giggles] See, uh, that's like darn 'cause it was a play on DAR. Boy, these carrots sure are tiny.
EMILY: Chase, I'm simply fascinated about your work situation. Tell us how you wound up back here at home. I mean, you move away to make your fortune and you end up right back here. Isn't life funny?
LORELAI: Hilarious.
RICHARD: It's a comedy for the masses.
CHASE: Well I worked hard and the company was very good to me. You know a thing or two about company loyalty I assume, Richard. Well, the company offered me a choice of East Coast locations, sort of a big vote of confidence in the job I was doing. Picking your locale, it's a very coveted position to be in.
LORELAI: Yeah, would like to be picking my locale right now.
CHASE: So I sat down and made my wish list. I looked for places that offered location amenities as well as job growth, and finally after days of research, checking into traffic conditions, crime rates, the best school systems, my decision came down to just two places. One was in New York, one was in Hartford.
LORELAI: And you chose Hartford.
CHASE: I did at that.
RICHARD: Emily, is there any more roast?
CHASE: Hartford has all the cosmopolitan big city benefits that New York has, without actually having to live in New York. It just seemed like a no brainer.
LORELAI: I'll get dad some more roast.
EMILY: Leta will bring it.
LORELAIL: Oh, but it's so much more personal this way.
EMILY: Hurry back. I just simply have to know what the allure of this Stars Hollow is I've heard so much about.
LORELAI: Miles and miles and miles.
CUT TO STARS HOLLOW
(Rory and Dean walk to the festival)
DEAN: So, what book did you bring?
RORY: What?
DEAN: Well, come on, you always bring a book with you and I was just wondering, what's the three month anniversary book?
RORY: Actually, I brought the New Yorker.
DEAN: A magazine. Really?
RORY: It's the fiction issue.
(From the gazebo, the mayor starts the festivities)
MAYOR: People of Stars Hollow, and our many friends. It gives me great pleasure to preside over our annual founders festival for the thirty-second time. Many a true love has had it start right on the spot where I stand. And I don't mind telling you that at this very festival, right by this gazebo, is where I met my own true love, Miss Dora Braythwait. We have been married for 43 years, and it all started right here.
TAYLOR: (covers microphone and whispers) Ask her to wave.
MAYOR: (whispers) I can't.
TAYLOR: Why not?
MAYOR: (To Taylor) She went to Bingo in Bridgeport. (To crowd) And now my friends, if you will join me in lighting the fire.
RORY: Okay, take me to the surprise now.
DEAN: But I thought you said you wanted to see the bonfire being lit.
RORY: Oh I do.
DEAN: Wait, but Mayor Porter just said. . .
RORY: Trust me. It's gonna be awhile before it's lit. We'll have plenty of time before they're ready.
MAYOR: Every damn year.
TAYLOR: It was Lenny's responsibility.
AYOR: Oh for Pete's sake. Does anyone have any matches?
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Lorelai, Emily, Richard, and Chase at dinner table.)
CHASE: It's really fascinating stuff.
EMILY: It sounds it. Tell us more.
CHASE: Well, we're in the middle of building new statistical models that let us do a better job at predicting death than we've ever been able to do before. Richard, you might find this interesting.
RICHARD: Well, I've never been one for sitting at a computer building models, Chase. I'm a client contact man myself.
CHASE: But these models give you a better product to sell to those clients.
EMILY: That does sound interesting.
CHASE: Oh it is. In fact, if you were to answer a few simple questions for me, I could practically pinpoint the day you're going to die.
EMILY: Goodness.
LORELAI: Go ahead. Ask her the questions.
EMILY: I think I'll pass.
CHASE: No no, Lorelai! I'd have to feed the information into a computer to get the answer. I'm no Kreskin!
EMILY: Well, Chase, why don't you and Lorelai retire to the living room for some Brandy while I help Leta clean up.
LORELAI: While you do what?
CHASE: That sounds lovely? Shall we?
LORELAI: Uh, sure. I'm just going to, um, go and powder my something. But I'll be back in a minute and I'll meet you in the living room.
CHASE: I'll be waiting.
LORELAI: Super.
CUT TO UPSTAIRS
(Lorelai walks into her old bedroom, grabs her coat off the bed, and starts to climb out the window when Richard walks in.)
RICHARD: Lorelai, your mother wants to know if. . .
LORELAI: Hi daddy. Okay, I know this is bad. And I know this probably brings back all the horrible aspects of my childhood life for you. And see, I'm really sorry that we fought last week, and I'm really sorry that you're so disappointed in me, and I really wish there was something I can do to fix that, but there probably isn't and I can accept that because I am an adult now and I am proud of who I have become. But I am begging you, please, please do not make me go back down there because that guy is boring.
RICHARD: Emily, she's not up here!
LORELAI: Thank you Daddy.
CUT TO JUNKYARD
(Rory and Dean are standing in front of a fenced-in junkyard)
DEAN: We're here.
ORY: We're where?
DEAN: Come on.
RORY: Dean, what is this?
DEAN: Okay. Uh, did you ever see Christine?
RORY: Yes.
DEAN: Well, it's nothing like that. Come on.
(They go through an opening in the fence)
RORY: You brought me to Beirut?
DEAN: It's a salvage yard.
RORY: Ah. And yet it looks so much like Beirut.
DEAN: Okay. Uh, here we are.
RORY: Wow.
DEAN: It's a car.
RORY: It is?
DEAN: Well, it will be.
RORY: When it grows up?
DEAN: When I fix it.
RORY: What?
DEAN: Um, it's yours.
RORY: What do you mean it's mine?
DEAN: I mean, I'm building it piece by piece for you.
RORY: No.
DEAN: Yeah. I started with the frame. The seats and the windshield just went in yesterday.
RORY: You're building me a car?
DEAN: Yeah, now it's gonna take awhile, but when I'm done, it'll be great.
RORY: You're building me a car. You're building me a car.
DEAN: That's right.
RORY: You're building me a car?
DEAN: I'm building you a car.
RORY: This is crazy. Why would you do this?
DEAN: I don't know. You didn't have one.
RORY: You're completely insane.
DEAN: What? I didn't want you wasting time on the bus anymore. I mean, that is very valuable time we could be arguing about your ongoing obsession with very confusing Russian authors.
RORY: I can't believe this
DEAN: Um, do you like it?
RORY: Do I like it? Are you kidding? (she kisses him)
DEAN: I'll take that as a yes.
RORY: Take it mister.
DEAN: Come on, get in.
(Dean tries to open the door for her, but it falls off the car.)
DEAN: Uh, I'll fix that.
RORY: Don't. I like it like that. (they both get in the car) This is amazing.
DEAN: I'm glad you like it.
RORY: I had no idea that three months was the car anniversary.
DEAN: Four months you get a plane.
RORY: Boy, relationships sure have changed since I was a kid. (they lean back and look at the stars) I'm having one of those moments right now.
DEAN: What moments?
RORY: One of those moments that everything is so perfect and so wonderful that you almost feel sad because nothing can ever be this good again.
DEAN: So, basically, I'm depressing you.
RORY: Yup.
DEAN: You're very weird.
RORY: And you're wonderful. (They kiss)
DEAN: Rory?
RORY: Yeah?
DEAN: I love you. (pause) Rory?
RORY: Yeah?
DEAN: Did you hear me?
RORY: Uh huh.
DEAN: Well, say something.
RORY: I. . . I. .
DEAN: Yeah?
RORY: I love the car.
DEAN: Uh, and that's it?
RORY: No. I just. . . I'm surprised, I didn't expect. . .I don't. . .
DEAN: You don't love me.
RORY: No, I just have to think about it for a minute.
DEAN: Think about what?
RORY: Well, saying I love you is a really difficult thing.
DEAN: Well I just did it.
RORY: And you did it really well.
DEAN: What the hell does that mean?
RORY: I'm sorry. Please. This totally came as a surprise. I mean, with the dinner, and the car, and then the I just need a minute to think
DEAN: This is not something that you think about Rory. This is either something that you feel or you don't.
RORY: Please, don't be mad.
DEAN: Why? Because I say I love you and you wanna think about it? I mean, go home and discuss it with your mother? Make one of your pro/con lists?
RORY: Not fair.
DEAN: I'm sorry. I'm an idiot. I don't even know what I was thinking.
RORY: Dean. Please, it's just not that easy for me. I mean, saying I love you means a lot. Think about it from my point of view. I mean, my mom and our life. I mean, my mom said that she loved my dad and then. . .
DEAN: You don't get pregnant saying I love you.
RORY: I know. I'm just confused. I need toIt's a really big deal.
DEAN: Fine, come on.
RORY: Dean, please don't be mad.
DEAN: I'll take you home.
RORY: Dean, tonight was amazing. It was perfect. Please, I swear, I just need a minute to. . .
DEAN: Whatever, it doesn't matter, all right? Let's go.
CUT TO FESTIVAL
JACKSON: Sookie?
SOOKIE: Yes Jackson?
JACKSON: You know what I'm thinking about right now?
SOOKIE: That time I roasted some red peppers over the stove burner and singed off my eyebrows?
JACKSON: No.
SOOKIE: Good.
JACKSON: I'm just thinking, this is really nice.
SOOKIE: Me too.
(Rachel takes some pictures, then walks over to a bench and sits down next to Luke.)
LUKE: You getting some good stuff?
RACHEL: Oh yeah, yeah, the firelight really changes people. Ya know, makes them seem happier, freer, all troubles of the world completely gone.
LUKE: I don't think that's the firelight. I think it's the Founders Day party punch they've been selling.
RACHEL: Oh yeah, that stuff is good
LUKE: Okay, at some point, are you gonna tell me what you're doing here?
RACHEL: I'm putting more film in my camera.
LUKE: Rachel.
RACHEL: What? I told you, I was at the airport, now I'm here.
LUKE: Oh well sure, when you put it like that.
RACHEL: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you don't sound all that happy to see me.
LUKE: Correct me if I'm wrong, but you have a tendency to show up and then leave, quite suddenly. One of your more charming attributes.
RACHEL: So you're not happy to see me? Luke, I don't know what I'm doing here. I just missed you. I wanted to see you. I don't know what else to say.
LUKE: I missed you too.
RACHEL: So since we're both being blunt, what's the deal with Lorelai?
LUKE: What are you talking about?
RACHEL: I'm talking about Lorelai, the lady who runs the inn, the one you've told me absolutely nothing about, and been very careful to leave out of every story, anecdote, or gossip about the town.
LUKE: There is no deal with Lorelai. We're friends.
RACHEL: For now?
LUKE: Yes.
RACHEL: And in the future?
LUKE: Well, Lorelai is, she's just uhI don't know. I mean, at time it seems like, I don't know. But I am happy to see you.
RACHEL: Good. I'm gonna get some of that party punch. You want some?
LUKE: That stuff will k*ll you.
RACHEL: Oh Luke, some things never change.
(Rachel walks away. After a few seconds, Lorelai sits down next to Luke.)
LORELAI: Hey. Where the hell's the fire department when you need them?
LUKE: Hey, aren't you supposed to be in Hartford?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: What happened?
LORELAI: Climbed out the window.
LUKE: Okay.
LORELAI: That's it. You're not curious why?
LUKE: No.
LORELAI: That's what I love about you.
LUKE: Hey, how long you been here?
LORELAI: A little while.
LUKE: Did you see Harry and Taylor get into a fist fight?
LORELAI: No! Aww! How did I miss that? I'm so bummed!
LUKE: It was good.
LORELAI: So where's Rachel?
LUKE: Oh, she's a founder's party punch junkie.
LORELAI: God, even the nice girls aren't safe.
LUKE: Yeah. She's been running around here taking all kinds of pictures.
LORELAI: She's having a good time.
LUKE: I guess so. I hope so.
LORELAI: So?
LUKE: Yes?
LORELAI: So, what's the haps with you two?
LUKE: The haps? Well, lets see. What is the haps?
LORELAI: I mean, like, ya know, what's going. . .
LUKE: I know what you meant by the haps.
LORELAI: Okay, well you're repeating it like a thousand times.
LUKE: I was pondering.
LORELAI: Well you ponder really slowly.
LUKE: If I did it fast it wouldn't be pondering. Pondering by nature is a slow connotation.
LORELAI: Okay. Fine, fine.
LUKE: It's okay.
LORELAI: Is she staying?
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: Do you want her to?
LUKE: I don't know.
LORELAI: She seems to really like you.
LUKE: Yeah she does, but she doesn't have the greatest attention span.
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: But she is here.
LORELAI: Yes, she is.
LUKE: I don't know. You spend a lot of time debating things, ya know, is it right, is it wrong, or should I do this, should I do that. I mean, sometimes you should just jump in and take a sh*t. What's the worst that can happen? She left before, I lived. Maybe this time.
LORELAI: I think that's really great.
LUKE: You do?
LORELAI: Yeah.
LUKE: Thanks.
LORELAI: You're welcome
LUKE: Well, I guess I'm gonna go check up on Rachel.
LORELAI: That's nice.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: That you have somebody you can go check up on. That's nice.
LUKE: Yeah it is. Unless she's completely drunk and throwing up.
LORELAI: Still nice.
LUKE: I'll see you tomorrow?
LORELAI: Tomorrow.
CUT TO LORELAIS HOUSE
(Lorelai walks in, picks up phone, dials, sits on the couch.)
MAX'S MACHINE: Hi, you've reached Max Medina. I'm not here right now so leave a message at the beep and I'll get back to you. Thanks.
(Rory walks in. Lorelai hangs up the phone.)
LORELAI: Rory?
RORY: We just broke up.
(Lorelai walks to Rory and hugs her.)

1.17 - The Breakup, Part 2
written by Amy Sherman-Palladino
directed by Nick Marck
transcript by Vanessa
[Lorelai and Rory hugging]
LORELAI: Tell me what happened.
RORY: We broke up, we just broke up.
LORELAI: But I don't understand.
RORY: We - we went to dinner and then we walked by the bonfire but it wasn't lit so we went to this junkyard and we sat in this car and then - oh God!
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I forgot your meatball in the car.
LORELAI: Oh honey, forget it.
RORY: Oh I can't believe I left your meatball in the car.
LORELAI: Ok, ok, come on [as they sit on the couch]
RORY: After I told the waiter to wrap it up and everything. And everyone was like what do you want with one meatball?' And I was like It's a mother/daughter thing.' And I'm sure he thought I was nuts but he was so nice and he did it anyway and he uh, he brought one of those tin foil swans or duck or some kind of bird and - and then I left it in the car.
LORELAI: Ok, forget about the meatball ok? Just tell me what happened.
RORY: He just broke up with me ok?
LORELAI: That doesn't make sense. This is Dean we're talking about. He's crazy about you. He calls like 25 times a day. Have you seen the cover of his notebook? It's one step away from stalker material.
RORY: I have to go to bed. [gets up and heads for her room]
LORELAI: Well, wait. Take me through the night step by step.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: So I can help decipher what happened here.
RORY: What happened here is we broke up. He didn't want to be my boyfriend anymore, end of story.
LORELAI: That is so not end of story.
RORY: Yes it is.
LORELAI: Honey, he did not plan an entire romantic evening complete with dinner and a junkyard, which we'll get back to later, and then suddenly decide to dump you for no reason.
RORY: How do you know? [as she pulls out a box from her closet.]
LORELAI: Because I have read every Nancy Drew mystery ever written. The one about the Amish country, twice. I know there's more to the story than what you're telling me. What are you doing?
RORY: I'm getting rid of all this stuff.
LORELAI: What stuff?
RORY: Everything he gave me, everything he touched, everything he looked at.
LORELAI: Honey, will you just calm down for just one second.
RORY: He doesn't want to be my boyfriend - fine.
LORELAI: Ok ,it will be fine but - [taking one of the shirts Rory was about to put in the box]
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Mine.
RORY: Oh.
LORELAI: Is there someone else?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Is he moving?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Uh, is he dying? Did his football team lose a game?
RORY: What ?
LORELAI: It's happened. Did he, um, try something?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You know, did he wanna
RORY: What?
LORELAI: Did he wanna go faster than you -
RORY: God no!
LORELAI: Ok, ok, I'm sorry.
RORY: Jeez..
LORELAI: You're just not giving me a lot to go off of here. Honey that's your fancy dress that I made for you.
RORY: That I wore to a dance that I went to with him.
LORELAI: Oh yeah. Sweater's brand-new.
RORY: Well he saw me in it yesterday and he liked it.
LORELAI: Well then he's got good taste.
RORY: He said it brought out the blue in my eyes.
LORELAI: Well then he's gay.
RORY: You're not funny and it goes.
LORELAI: I'm a little funny and if you throw away everything Dean ever saw you wear you're gonna be walking around in a towel. Colonel Clucker? Are you serious? He has been with you since you were four.
RORY: The first time Dean came over, he picked it up.
LORELAI: Well that's the not the colonel's fault. He was sitting there minding his own business and a guy comes in and picks him up, what's a stuffed bird to do?
RORY: I don't want to joke about this, not now.
LORELAI: Ok.
RORY: Here. [giving her the box] I don't want to look at that anymore.
LORELAI: Ok, I'll, um, I'll put it away.
RORY: No, take it out of the house. Throw it in a dumpster, burn it, I don't care. Just - I want it gone.
LORELAI: You know honey, some day, when all of this is in the past, you may be sorry that you don't have some of those things anymore.
RORY: I don't care.
LORELAI: But Rory -
RORY: I don't care!
LORELAI: Ok. Fine. It's gone.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: So I'll take care of this and you go to bed and get some rest. Maybe you'll fell more like talking in the morning.
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: Honey, good night.
RORY: Mom
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: Far, far away from the house ok?
LORELAI: Hey, it sleeps with the fishes.
RORY: Thank you. [Lorelai puts the box in a closet instead and covers it with a blanket.]
[Pan to morning. Lorelai's bedroom]
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Mmm.
RORY: Mom get up.
LORELAI: Rory what's the matter?
RORY: Nothing, I just want to get started. I made a list of all the things we say we're going to do on the weekend but then when the weekend comes around you say they're too boring to actually do one a weekend day, so then you say we'll do them during the week, which of course we never do. So I think that we should get them all out of the way today once and for all. And to make it interesting, we should come up with like a reward system so once we're done with everything on the list we could go get manicures or we could go to the Swiss place for fondue for dinner or we could stuff our purses full of sour patch kids and milk duds and go see the Stars Hollow elementary school production of Who's afraid of Virginia Woolfe.'
LORELAI: It's 6:00.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: On Saturday morning.
RORY: That's right.
LORELAI: It's 6:00 on Saturday morning!
RORY: Do you want to wear docks or sneakers?
LORELAI: I want to wear slippers.
RORY: Up please.
LORELAI: Rory, my heart. It is Saturday, the day of rest.
RORY: Sunday's the day of rest.
LORELAI: No, Saturday is the day of pre-rest.
RORY: Pre-rest?
LORELAI: Yeah, so that way when you actually get to Sunday you're rested enough to enjoy your rest.
RORY: That makes absolutely no sense.
LORELAI: That's because it's 6:00 on Saturday morning. [Rory uncovers her] Oh jeez!
RORY: Up please!
LORELAI: You make a rhyme.
RORY: I'll see you downstairs.
LORELAI: Ugh!
[Pan to Lorelai coming down the stairs. She turns to go into the kitchen and stops, turns back to look at the living room only to find all the furniture moved around. Heads into the kitchen]
LORELAI: Hello. Did you rearrange the furniture?
RORY: Yes.
LORELAI: Good, cause for a minute there I thought we were having a problem with decorator elves and I was gonna have to call an exterminator and tent the place but it was just you. Great. Good. So now was there any reason that you just suddenly felt the need to move around large pieces of furniture first thing in the morning?
RORY: I was up, it was there.
LORELAI: Ok good thought process. Great. Now I noticed you didn't move the tv though.
RORY: It was too heavy.
LORELAI: Right, ok. Well I like this, yeah, this is good. Now of course when the sofa actually faced the tv it made it a little easier to watch but you know this is good too. It'll be like um, you know like radio.
RORY: Are you ready to go?
LORELAI: Yes I am, just uh, just one quick sec. Um, why don't you - could you put the pen down?
RORY: Just finishing the list.
LORELAI: Yes I see and as much as I love your list, let's just finish this particular one in a little while ok?
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: Rory, I'm concerned about you. I wish you would talk to me.
RORY: I don't want to deal with it right now. I can't deal with it right now.
LORELAI: Fair enough. But listen, I've had my heart broken before. It's really hard. It's hard for everyone, so can I give you a little advice.
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: I think what you really need to do today is wallow.
RORY: Wallow?
LORELAI: Oh yeah, get back in your pajamas, go to bed, eat nothing but gallons of ice cream and tons of pizza, don't take a shower or shave your legs or put on any kind of make up at all and just sit in the dark and watch a really sad movie and have a good long cry and just wallow. You need to wallow.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Rory, your first love is intense and your first break up even more intense. Shoving it away and ignoring it while you make lists it's not gonna help.
RORY: I don't want to wallow.
LORELAI: Try it for one day.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: One day, one day of pizza and pajamas. I'll rent Love Story' and The Champ', 'An Affair to Remember', Ishtar'.
RORY: I don't want to be that kind of girl.
LORELAI: the kind of girl that watches Ishtar'?
RORY: The kind of girl who just falls apart because she doesn't have a boyfriend.
LORELAI: That description hardly applies to you.
RORY: It will if I wallow.
LORELAI: Not true.
RORY: So I used to have a boyfriend and now I don't. Ok, that's just the way it is. I mean sitting in the dark eating junk food and not shaving my legs isn't gonna change that, is it?
LORELAI: No.
RORY: Ok, so I don't even want to go there. I have things to do, I have school and Harvard to think about.
LORELAI: Honey, Harvard is like three years away.
RORY: But now is the time to be preparing for it. I mean Harvard is hard to get into and I don't know why I even spend my time thinking about anything else.
LORELAI: Because you have a pulse and you are not the president of the audio visual club.
RORY: I'm 16, I have the rest of my life to have a boyfriend. I should be keeping my eye on the prize right now.
LORELAI: I admire your attitude.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: So should we rent Old Yeller' too or is that just a guy's crying movie.
RORY: You're not listening to me.
LORELAI: I am listening to you, I just - I don't agree with you.
RORY: I don't want to wallow, and you can't make me.
LORELAI: Ok. Fine.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: So that must be the list.
RORY: Yes it is.
LORELAI: May I see it please? We do not need a garden hose.
RORY: We don't have one.
LORELAI: We don't have a garden either.
RORY: But maybe if we have a hose we can grow one.
LORELAI: Can I see the pen please?
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: Small adjustment, small adjustment. [writes something on the list and hands the list back to Rory]
RORY: Mom...
LORELAI: What? It's on the list. Don't you have to do it if it's on the list?!
RORY: I'm not going to wallow [crossing it out]
LORELAI: But I put it after going to the recycling center.
CUT TO STREET
[Lorelai and Rory walking]
LORELAI: What are all these people doing up? It's Saturday morning.
RORY: Some people like getting up early.
LORELAI: You lie.
RORY: No they do it voluntarily.
LORELAI: Really?
RORY: Everyday.
LORELAI: Ha! Jumpback!
RORY: Excuse me?
LORELAI: Kevin Bacon, Footloose, reaction to the no dancing in town rule is revealed to him by Chris Penn, brother to Sean, sage to all.
RORY: I shoulda known.
LORELAI: Yes you should. I don't know what they teach you in that damn school. [Rory stops walking] What?
RORY: I can't go that way.
LORELAI: Why, we're going to Luke's.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: You pull me out of bed at 6:00 in the morning and then you say no' to Luke's? Don't you know how dangerous that is?
RORY: I can't go that way.
LORELAI: Reason please?
RORY: Because we'd have to go by Doose's market.
LORELAI: So?
RORY: So we might run into -
LORELAI: Oh.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: Right. Um, you don't know if he's working?
RORY: I don't remember. His weekend schedule changes a lot.
LORELAI: Ok, well we'll just take the long way.
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Why?
RORY: We'd have to go by the school.
LORELAI: But there's no school today.
RORY: But on his days off from work he plays football at the school with some of his friends.
LORELAI: Well what time?
RORY: It varies.
LORELAI: Ok, well we'll just go down Peach street, we'll circle around, you're shaking your head why?
RORY: He lives on Peach.
LORELAI: Rory, honey, love of my life, you realize you've completely cut us from Luke's where the happy coffee is.
RORY: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: No, it's ok, it's ok. Ok, we'll just um, well, we'll figure something out.
CUT TO ALLEY
RORY: Sorry.
LORELAI: No, this is good. This is like G.I. Jane' but we get to keep our hair.
RORY: I just couldn't.
LORELAI: Oh honey, say no more. Think of this as an adventure. Two girls battling the elements, desperate for survival.
RORY: Or coffee.
LORELAI: Same thing.
RORY: You know I bet you can tell a lot about people from their garbage.
LORELAI: Yeah.
RORY: Think about it, trash is discarded aspect of people's lives.
LORELAI: Hmm.
RORY: It talks about their eating habits, what they read, do they go to concerts, are they responsible, do they pay bills on time?
LORELAI: Yeah, you do know honey, that garbage doesn't actually talk at all unless it's on Sesame Street.
RORY: I'm just trying to make a point.
LORELAI: That going through people's garbage is interesting.
RORY: And educational.
LORELAI: And stinky and a little nuts.
RORY: There's nothing nuts about wanting to know more about human nature. [picking up an article of clothing from a pile of garbage] Curiosity is how we grow.
LORELAI: Bah! [making her drop it and pulling her out of the alley] We have to get you out of this alley.
CUT TO LUKE'S
[Lorelai and Rory enter from the back.]
LORELAI: Who are all these people?
RORY: It's the 6:00 am crowd.
LORELAI: I officially recognize nobody in this place.
RACHEL: Hey.
LORELAI: Oh hi.
RACHEL: Coffee while you wait?
LORELAI: Oh bless you. [she pours coffee] So Luke put you to work huh?
RACHEL: Yeah well I figured if I'm going to be hanging around here for a while the least I could do is help out.
LORELAI: So you're gonna be hanging around for a while...here?
RACHEL: Yeah I think so.
LORELAI: Oh well that's nice.
RACHEL: Yeah.
RORY: So where is Luke?
RACHEL: Well we were kind of up late last night so I let him sleep in.
LORELAI: Sleep in? Luke?
RACHEL: Oh believe me it wasn't easy to get him to agree to it, but in the end, a little sweet talk, a couple of Excedrin PM he finally caved.
RORY: Hey there's a seat over there.
LORELAI: Great.
RACHEL: Oh go, go! I'll be over in a sec.
LORELAI: Ok.
RORY: I feel like everyone is staring at me.
LORELAI: Well yeah, because you've got a banana peel stuck to your foot.
RORY: I do?
LORELAI: I'm kidding. Nobody's staring at you.
RORY: They know.
LORELAI: They don't know.
RORY: It's probably all around town by now.
LORELAI: Honey it just happened last night, it's like 6:00 in the morning.
RORY: Everyone knows that I've been dumped.
LORELAI: Do you want to go home?
RORY: No, we have a list.
LORELAI: Ok great. I'm gonna order us something. Any preference - eggs, french toast, key to the dumpster?
RORY: I don't care.
LORELAI: Ok, I'll be right back. [heads for the counter and runs into Miss Patty]
MISS PATTY: Lorelai, what a nice surprise so early in the morning. So how's things?
LORELAI: You know don't you?
MISS PATTY: Yes and I feel awful. I feel completely responsible.
LORELAI: Well you should. [smiling]
MISS PATTY: Well I got Dean that job and I certainly encouraged them, I felt they were so right together.
LORELAI: Miss Patty, please don't say anything to Rory about it, she's a little concerned about everybody finding out.
MISS PATTY: Oh of course, not a peep.
LORELAI: And spread the word ok?
MISS PATTY: Consider it done. Oh and Lorelai, would you give the angel a hug for me. I mean you don't have to say it's from me, just give her a hug.
LORELAI: Got it.
MISS PATTY: Ok. [leaves. Lorelai head for the counter as Luke comes down the stairs]
LORELAI: Oh well, uh, good morning sleeping beauty.
LUKE: Yeah, well you know Rachel thought I looked a little tired.
LORELAI: No, it's good. You need a little break.
LUKE: I guess.
LORELAI: You do. So she seems pretty comfortable here huh?
LUKE: Yeah well she always could just fit in places you know. It's a talent of hers.
LORELAI: She looks good in your apron.
LUKE: Yeah well, can I get you anything?
LORELAI: Oh, um, do you think you could make those really crazy chocolate chip pancakes and go extra heavy on the chocolate?
LUKE: Yeah sure, any special occasion?
LORELAI: [sighs] Dean broke up with Rory.
LUKE: What?!
LORELAI: Keep it down, she doesn't want anybody to know about it.
LUKE: Oh I knew it, I just knew that kid was trouble.
LORELAI: Yes you did, you knew it. Pancakes please.
LUKE: Oh God, he's got a nerve. I mean what does he think he's gonna do better than Rory? Is he crazy? Jeez. Alright, well forget it ok. Good riddance, adios, bienvenidos, hasta la vista.
LORELAI: Could we get off the small world ride and start cooking please?
LUKE: How is she?
LORELAI: She's been dumped by her first boyfriend.
LUKE: Oh man, I swear I would love to - ok, I'm gonna put some whipped cream on the pancakes too.
LORELAI: Thank you Luke.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: Not a word ok?
LUKE: I got it. [Lorelai turns around and sees Kirk talking to Rory]
KIRK: I never liked him. I don't know what it was, something about the shape of his forehead or his height or the floppy hair style. Actually yes, on reflection I think it was the floppy hair style.
LORELAI: Hey good morning Kirk.
KIRK: Lorelai, I want to express my apologies for not voicing my concerns about that floppy haired jerk earlier because if I had -
LORELAI: Oh you know what - you need to leave now.
KIRK: I cannot go until you accept my apology.
LORELAI: I accept your apology.
KIRK: Alright.
LORELAI: Ok.
KIRK: It will not happen again. [Kirk leaves]
LORELAI: Ok.
RORY: Thank you.
LORELAI: Honey are you sure you don't want to -
RORY: Don't say wallow'.
LORELAI: Swallow your coffee before you eat?
RORY: I am fine.
LORELAI: But if you could see the look on your face.
RORY: It's the same look you had on your face when you broke up with Max. Did wallowing help you get over him?
LORELAI: I'm not saying wallowing will help you get over Dean. It's part of the process. It's the mourning period. It's a step, an important step. The only thing that will get you over somebody is time.
RORY: How much time did it take you to get over Max?
LORELAI: I'm not sure exactly.
RORY: Approximately?
LORELAI: I didn't clock it.
RORY: Ballpark figure?
LORELAI: A while.
RORY: Be vaguer.
LORELAI: Rory come on.
LUKE: More coffee? Pancakes are coming right up, anything else I can get you?
RORY: No thanks.
LUKE: Hey I've got some strawberries back there, you like strawberries don't you?
RORY: Yeah I like strawberries but -
LUKE: I'm getting you strawberries. [moves to the next table]
RORY: You told him didn't you?
LORELAI: No. Miss Patty did. [Luke sees Dean heading towards the diner and as he goes out to meet him, Rory and Lorelai keep talking.]
RORY: Well who told Miss Patty?
LORELAI: I don't know, numerous sources.
[Pan to outside diner]
LUKE: Stop right there.
DEAN: What?
LUKE: Where are you going?
DEAN: To get coffee.
LUKE: Wrong.
DEAN: Excuse me?
LUKE: You're not going in there buddy.
DEAN: What are you talking about?
LUKE: Turn around bag boy.
DEAN: Are you serious?
LUKE: Do you see a smile on my face?
DEAN: No but what's different about that?
LUKE: What's that supposed to mean?
DEAN: It's just that you're not exactly known as the town crack up.
LUKE: So you're a smart guy now huh?
DEAN: What are you doing?
LUKE: Just exercising my right not to serve you.
DEAN: What are you talking about? I'm not even inside yet. [tries to get away but they end up wrestling] Let go of me!
LUKE: You first.
[Pan to inside]
RORY: If you tell Miss Patty, everybody in town is gonna know.
LORELAI: Honey people have their own lives and their own problems. I hardly think you and Dean breaking up is the main thing on their minds. [sees Luke and Dean wrestling outside] Oh my God! Oh!
RORY: What? [sees them wrestling] Oh my God.
[Lorelai and Rory run outside]
LORELAI: Hey, hey, hey, cut it out! Break it up! [to Luke]You back off! Come here! What do you think you're doing?!
LUKE: He started it!
LORELAI: By doing what?
LUKE: He was coming in.
LORELAI: Are you a lunatic! He's 16!
LUKE: Well what was I supposed to do?!
LORELAI: Well stand in the middle of the street and have a slap fight of course! Come here! [taking him inside]
RORY: [to Dean] Are you ok?
DEAN: I'm fine.
RORY: Oh good, I don't know what go into Luke. He's usually so -
DEAN: I have to go.
RORY: Oh sure, bye. [leaves as Luke follows him]
LORELAI: Get inside now. Inside - now!
LUKE: He started it. [goes inside.]
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: So where's that list?
RORY: What?
LORELAI: The list, we've got a lot to do Missy, otherwise I'm gonna be dragging your butt outta bed at 6:00 again tomorrow morning. So, where do we start?
RORY: [pulling out list] Well we need a soap dish for the kitchen
LORELAI: Ah, a kitchen soap dish. Quite decadent but what the hell, let's go.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
[Girls come in with bags]
RORY: Well that was a very successful outing for us.
LORELAI: Yes it was.
RORY: We got everything on the list except for the brown extension cord.
LORELAI: Which will be in on Tuesday.
RORY: So I think that that qualifies as a check too.
LORELAI: Are you happy?
RORY: I appreciate a job well done, yeah.
LORELAI: I can't wait to try the toaster pizza. It looks so gross which is usually the mark for a great junk food.
RORY: Beefaroni.
LORELAI: nough said.
RORY: I'm gonna go plug in my new wall air freshener. Give me five minutes and then come sniff my room.
LORELAI: Cheese or pepperoni?
RORY: Whatever. [goes into her room and closes the door]
LORELAI: Both. Good choice. [Babette enters]
BABETTE: Hey Sugar, I just heard. Where is she? Poor little thing. Rory sweetie!
LORELAI: Come on. [pulling her outside]
BABETTE: What? Is she outside?
LORELAI: Uh, well yeah. [outside] Babette I appreciate you coming over like this bur Rory's not really in a talking mood just now.
BABETTE: But I can help.
LORELAI: I know you can.
BABETTE: I can tell her how you have to go through a lot of bad relationship's to get to that really good one.
LORELAI: No, it's very good advice.
BABETTE: Oh yeah and I can tell her about all the horrible men I've known in my day.
LORELAI: Oh that'd be great.
BABETTE: Really truly awful men.
LORELAI: Babette.
BABETTE: I was pushed out of a moving car once.
LORELAI: Now that's a peppy little anecdote. [In the house, Rory comes out of her room and overhears them.]
BABETTE: Let me tell her.
LORELAI: Oh I want you to tell her all that but just not now.
BABETTE: Is she really bad?
LORELAI: She'll be fine. Really.
[Rory goes back into her room and lies on the bed. Looks at her wrist where the bracelet that Dean made her used to be. She gets mad at herself for feeling that way and picks up her books to try and study. Madeline's party invitation slips out from some papers. She picks it up and goes out into the kitchen]
LORELAI: [coming in] Oh they had some of our mail.
RORY: Look [handing her the invition]
LORELAI: Madeline's having a party.
RORY: I'm going to go.
LORELAI: You're going to a Chilton party?
RORY: Yes I am.
LORELAI: Honey, why don't you just stay home and read The bell jar'? Same effect.
RORY: Hey, I'm going to be going to school there for the next two and a half years. It wouldn't k*ll me to be social right? What's wrong with that?
LORELAI: Nothing.
RORY: Ok then it's settled.
LORELAI: Um, can I make a suggestion?
RORY: Go ahead.
LORELAI: Why don't you see if Lane can come with you? You know that way if the socializing doesn't turn out how you planned you got a friendly face around.
RORY: Ok, good idea. Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
RORY: Can I take the car?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: Can I borrow something to wear?
LORELAI: Yes.
RORY: Are you gonna give in to anything I say because you feel sorry for me?
LORELAI: Yes!
RORY: I'll make a list.
[Pan to that night. Rory and Lane getting ready.]
RORY: Here, hand me that blush.
LANE: Ok.
RORY: Am I all twisty back here?
LANE: Oh, a little. Here. [fixes dress] So how are you?
RORY: I'm...fine.
LANE: How are you really?
RORY: Life goes on right?
LANE: You know I saw Dean today. I wasn't sure if I should tell you.
RORY: Why not?
LANE: I mean I wasn't sure you'd want to know.
RORY: No, that's fine. What'd he say?
LANE: Nothing. He crossed the street as soon as I saw him.
RORY: Oh.
LANE: But if it's any consolation he looks really sad.
RORY: I don't want him to be sad.
LANE: Rory are you sure you want to go out tonight?
RORY: Why does everyone keep asking me that?
LANE: Because you just broke up. I mean I'd be perfectly fine to just hang out here and listen to music and talk, not talk, whatever.
RORY: No, I am not hanging out. We are going to this party. It's gonna be great. I don't want to dwell on this. That's final.
LORELAI: [entering room] Don't argue with her or you'll find yourself the proud owner of three garden weasels.
RORY: Mom.
LORELAI: Three cause one's just not enough. Here, turn around.
RORY: Why?
LORELAI: 14 hours of labor that's why. [clicks her tongue]
RORY: Fine.
LORELAI: And hair. [puts a necklace on Rory]
RORY: What is this?
LORELAI: I thought it would go with your dress and it does.
RORY: It's pretty.
LORELAI: Yeah it's really pretty. Here. Here is the phone and some mad money. If for any reason you think you're not going to be home by 12:00 you call me.
LANE: Oh we'll be back by 12:00
LORELAI: Hi, call me.
LANE: Sorry.
LORELAI: Rory?
RORY: The cornstarch.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: Um the cornstarch. The first time Dean kissed me he - I forgot to put it with the other things. I'll just throw it out.
LORELAI: Hey why don't you let me do that, you guys get going ok?
RORY: Ok.
LORELAI: Ok, bye. Have fun. Ooh hey, look in somebody's sock drawer. Rich people have hilarious sock drawers. Be good. [Rory and Lane leave. Lorelai puts the cornstarch with the rest of the stuff and pulls down her Max box']



CUT TO SOOKIE'S
LORELAI: Hey.
SOOKIE: Hi, Lorelai, hey.
LORELAI: I wanted to ask you - [Sookie runs back into the house]
SOOKIE: Uh-huh, sure whatever.
LORELAI: [left at the door] Sookie? Hello? Sookiehoney.
SOOKIE: Yeah. Hi, ah! How are you? [as she tries to look into the kitchen]
LORELAI: Good, I'm fine, how's that xray vision coming?
SOOKIE: Jackson's inside.
LORELAI: Is he doing something dirty?
SOOKIE: He's making me dinner.
LORELAI: Oh! Oh that's so nice.
SOOKIE: Yeah it is. It really is, it's sweet. I'm just - do you hear something?
LORELAI: Like what?
SOOKIE: Like someone using the wrong size pan to sweat the onions in. [knocks and chuckles]
LORELAI: No, nothing like that.
SOOKIE: Ok well maybe I'm hearing things. So hi, how are you?
LORELAI: Fine. So I wanted to see -
SOOKIE: Could you peek inside the kitchen for me and tell me if the orange cruse is on the left burner.
LORELAI: Why don't you just go in there?
SOOKIE: Yeah well now I would but Jackson kicked me out.
LORELAI: He did.
SOOKIE: Yes and he won't let me back in there and it's driving me crazy.
LORELAI: Well maybe he just wants you to relax, I wouldn't mind that either actually.
SOOKIE: Just take a peek for me will you? Tell him you want some water. And here. Take a picture for me.
LORELAI: Oh Sookie. I am not spying on Jackson.
SOOKIE: What if he's using the wrong spoon in the wrong sauce?
LORELAI: Then the world as we know it will end.
SOOKIE: I have to go in there.
JACKSON: [bursting through the doors] You stay right where you are.
SOOKIE: Jackson you're being unreasonable.
JACKSON: Sookie when a person offers to make another person dinner because this person happens to be a chef and is always cooking for others, that is what happens to be a nice gesture.
SOOKIE: Yes but -
JACKSON: And when that person accepts the first person's offer, that means that the first person, the one who offered to cook, would actually be doing the cooking while the other person relaxed, had some wine and stayed out of the kitchen!
SOOKIE: I wasn't cooking, I was suggesting.
JACKSON: Well you suggested the ladle right out of my hand four times!
SOOKIE: I had to skim the top of the sauce or it would've gotten all -
JACKSON: Damn it Sookie, this is supposed to be romantic!
SOOKIE: It is!
JACKSON: Stay outta here. I am cooking this meal alone. I am also cleaning up alone.
SOOKIE: No.
JACKSON: Oh yes.
SOOKIE: But you don't know how to load my dishwasher, I have a system.
JACKSON: I'll wing it. [goes back into the kitchen]
SOOKIE: There's a diagram in the pantry - use it. I'm begging you![yells from the doorway]
JACKSON: I'm doing two loads, just because I can!
LORELAI: Honey try and sit down and relax. It's nice what he's doing.
SOOKIE: I know you're right. It is nice. Ok, alright...I'm sitting, I'm relaxing, I'm focusing on you.
LORELAI: Good. Um actually I wanted to ask you a favour.
SOOKIE: What?
LORELAI: Could I take your car for a little while, Rory's got mine and there's something I want to do.
SOOKIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah of course. What's so important?
LORELAI: Oh um, I'll tell you later.
SOOKIE: It sounds serious.
LORELAI: I'll have it back to you as soon as I can.
SOOKIE: Take your time, I'm in for the night.
LORELAI: Ok, bye hon.
SOOKIE: Bye. [sighs. There's a crash in the kitchen] What happened?! What did you do?
CUT TO MAX'S APARTMENT
LORELAI: Hi.
MAX: Lorelai what...
LORELAI: Rory and Dean broke up.
MAX: Oh, well, I'm sorry. Rory -
LORELAI: Yeah, Rory and Dean broke up and um, she won't wallow. And I told her that she should wallow you know because that's supposed to help you get through the pain and then you can accept it and then you can get over somebody and you can move on with your life. And then she asked me how long it was before I got over you and I didn't know what to say you know because I can't lie to her, and I realized that if I gave her any time frame at all I would be lying because I'm not over you and I don't know how long it will be before I am. And who am I to be teaching her about healing and moving on and breakups any how. I mean I might as well be teaching her how to eat fire or swallow a sword or put her legs behind her head you know, because at least that's a trade. I mean the first two are, I don't know about putting the legs um, behind your head, but the point is that I'm an idiot and I'm a hypocrite and I really miss you.
MAX: Do you want to come in?
LORELAI: Yes please.
CUT TO MADELINE'S HOUSE
LANE: Wow, this is unbelievable. My wedding won't be this big.
RORY: Yeah.
LORELAI: This is amazing! People live here?
RORY: This is Madeline's house.
LANE: Is this what your grandparents house looks like?
RORY: No. I mean it's big but it's not this Hearst castlely.
LANE: I mean there should be a map or a tour guide or Robin Leech or something.
RORY: Hey Lane.
LANE: Yeah?
RORY: Thanks for coming with me.
LANE: Anytime. Oh my God, there's a pool table.
RORY: And a deejay.
LANE: It's like a teenage Sodom and Gommarah.
MADELINE: You came!
RORY: Yeah.
LOUISE: Who's watching the farm?
RORY: Madeline you house is beautiful.
MADELINE: Thanks it's my stepfather's.
LOUISE: So where is he?
MADELINE: My stepfather? He's in Japan.
LOUISE: No not your stepfather. Prince Charming?
RORY: He didn't come.
LOUISE: Why?
RORY: His white horse was in the shop.
LOUISE: You guys didn't break up did you?
LANE: Hi, I'm Lane.
LOUISE: As in walk down a...'?
LANE: Yes exactly.
MADELINE: Hi I'm Madeline. [two guys come up and wrap their arms around Louise and Madeline.]
GUY: So when does the tour of the pool house start?
MADELINE: You've seen the pool house before.
LOUISE: Yes but they haven't seen it at night right?
GUY: Right.
MADELINE: But -
LOUISE: Madeline, you are not confused. Think. Process. Focus.
MADELINE: Oh! Bye!
LOUISE: Later Paris.
PARIS: No glove no love.
LOUISE: Lovely.
PARIS: So I didn't think you were much of a party girl.
RORY: I'm not usually but I thought I might come by and check it out.
PARIS: Same exact people we see at school except now we get to see them dance. So where is your boyfriend?
RORY: We, um, we broke up.
PARIS: Oh. Well at least you had a boyfriend for a while.
RORY: So do you know, um, which way would lead us to some soda?
PARIS: Keep up because I'm not turning around.
LANE: Wow, you didn't exaggerate.
RORY: Paris needs no embellishments.
LANE: All this soda is French.
PARIS: Madeline's mother has a French fetish. She's obsessed with all things French. French wine, French food, French water, French cellulite products.
TRISTIN: Look why won't you answer me?
SUMMER: Because you didn't say 'please'.
TRISTIN: Summer.
SUMMER: Can we do this later? There's a party going on.
TRISTIN: Just tell me what you were doing locked in the bathroom with Austin.
SUMMER: Nothing.
TRISTIN: Nothing?
SUMMER: Yup.
TRISTIN: No.
SUMMER: Well why don't you tell me what I was doing since you seem to know everything.
TRISTIN: Hey you are my girlfriend.
SUMMER: Ooh now he's a caveman. What are you doing to do, know me on the back of my head with a club and then drag me back to your Porsche?
TRISTIN: Summer please.
SUMMER: Ooh, good song. [turns around and dances. Tristin looks around the room then leaves.]
PARIS: I just love that Summer don't you? 9:45.
RORY: Why do you keep checking your watch?
PARIS: My mom says I have to stay until 10:30.
RORY: Why would she care?
PARIS: She thinks I'm not enough of a people person. Shocking huh?
RORY: I'm floored.
PARIS: Yeah well, I doubt highly that Madam Curie was voted most likely to dress like Jennifer Lopez.
RORY: You want to be a scientist?
PARIS: Cancer research.
RORY: Cool.
PARIS: Yeah.
LANE: Oh no.
RORY: What?
LANE: It just figures that the only Korean boy at this party has his Korean girl radar turned on.
HENRY: Hi.
LANE: Hi.
HENRY: I'm Henry.
LANE: I'm Lane. This is Rory and Paris.
PARIS: We've met.
HENRY: Paris. So would you like to dance?
LANE: Oh well we're talking here.
HENRY: Oh yeah, but I mean one dance? You can put the conversation on hold for one dance right? Unless this is a mid-east peace talk kind of conversation.
LANE: One dance.
HENRY: A short one. No crazy dance mixes.
LANE: Ok.
HENRY: Thank you.
LANE: [taking off her coat and handing it to Rory whispers] If I'm not back in one dance you're coming down with a really bad case of anything that means we had to go home.
RORY: Whoa is it getting warm here or is it just me?
LANE: Thank you.
PARIS: Unbelievable! She's here five minutes she has a date. I've been going to this school nine years and I'm the French soda monitor.
[Rory walks around and finds a place to put her and Lane's coats. She walks around the house and sees Tristin leaning again a wall watching Summer dance with some guy. She watches him for a second then moves on.]
CUT TO MAX'S
[Lorelai and Max are kissing]
LORELAI: Just in case this comes up later, I did not come here for this.
MAX: Ok, go it.
LORELAI: Ok.
MAX: Oh this is crazy! [separating]
LORELAI: No it is, it's nuts. It's nuts.
MAX: I mean I don't see you for months and then all of a sudden -
LORELAI: Ding-dong Avon lady.
MAX: It's insane.
LORELAI: Completely. [they kiss again] You do that so good.
MAX: [stopping again] Ok, we've got to get a grip here.
LORELAI: I thought that's what we were doing.
MAX: You know you're going to sit over there on that couch.
LORELAI: Fine.
MAX: And I'm gonna sit here on this - on this chair...far away from the couch. And I'm gonna put this table right in between us just like that. Good. Ok. And we're gonna sit here and talk about this calmly.
LORELAI: Sounds good.
MAX: How you been?
LORELAI: Good, really good.
MAX: Oh you look really good.
LORELAI: So do you.
MAX: I missed you.
LORELAI: Oh I'm glad. Otherwise that greeting there would've been a little innappropriate.
MAX: You know actually, I've been thinking about us lately.
LORELAI: You have?
MAX: Haven't you?
LORELAI: No.
MAX: No?
LORELAI: No. I haven't given it any thought at all.
MAX: I'm flattered.
LORELAI: No, I needed not to give it any thought at all otherwise I would give it too much thought and that would be hard and so I just didn't deal. Like mother like daughter I guess.
MAX: Oh I understand.
LORELAI: So, with all the thought you've been giving it, have you come up with any great solutions?
MAX: No. You're still Rory's mom and I'm still her teacher and we're still us. I got nothing.
LORELAI: Oh.
MAX: Yeah.
LORELAI: So nothing's changed.
MAX: Nothing's changed.
LORELAI: So I guess my coming here was probably a bad idea.
MAX: Probably. [tosses table] Oh screw this. [they stand up and kiss again]
CUT TO MADELINE'S
[Rory walking around. She sees Lane]
RORY: [whispers] Hey am I sick yet?
LANE: Not yet. It actually might just be allergies.
RORY: Keep me posted.
PARIS: My watched stopped, what time is it?
RORY: It's 10:35.
PARIS: Yes, bye. [runs out of the house. Rory finds a quieter room and sits down and starts to read.]
SUMMER: Tristin stop it.
TRISTIN: You're making me chase you around the whole party.
SUMMER: Just trying t have fun.
TRISTIN: Ok you won't talk to me, you won't dance with me, why the hell did you even come with me?!
SUMMER: Stop yelling.
TRISTIN: Summer please. Can we just go?
SUMMER: No.
TRISTIN: Please.
SUMMER: No. I'm sick of fighting with you. I'm sick of hearing 20 times a day You're my girlfriend'.
TRISTIN: Ok could we possibly do this somewhere were a roomful of people aren't staring at us?
SUMMER: I think we should break up.
TRISTIN: Ok, I really want to go outside and talk about this.
SUMMER: Then go, bye. [she leaves]
TRISTIN: Summer come on! [Looks around, sees Rory who looks down at her book and he leaves.]
[Lane enters the room]
LANE: I have a major problem.
RORY: What?
LANE: Henry, the guy I've been dancing with?
RORY: Yeah?
LANE: Ok so he's really good in school, he's going to be a doctor - pediatrician to be exact, his parents are extremely involved in their local church. He himself helps out with Sunday school. He speaks Korean fluently, he respects his parents and he's also really cute, very funny and surprisingly interesting.
RORY: Lane I'm sorry, but I'm totally failing to see the problem here.
LANE: I'm falling for a guy my parents would approve of! They'd love him, they'd go crazy! There'd be dancing in the Kim house! Dancing!
RORY: Really?
LANE: Followed by a lot of praying but initially there'd be dancing. This is horrible. This can't happen. I have to stop it. We have to go.
RORY: But uh -
LANE: No now! You need to grab your stuff, we gotta go.
RORY: Ok, yeah, ok. Whatever you say.
HENRY: Hey.
LANE: Henry, hi.
HENRY: [to Rory] Sorry I've been monopolizing Lane all night.
RORY: Oh no, that's ok. I've had her for 15 years. I'm actually a little sick of her.
LANE: Thank you.
RORY: Yeah you're welcome. Um we should go.
HENRY: [to Lane] Oh you're going?
LANE: Oh well -
RORY: Yeah. I have to get home - I have a very strict mother.
HENRY: Oh wow, sorry about that. You couldn't even stay for one more dance huh?
RORY: Yeah I don't think that -
LANE: Yes.
RORY: Excuse me?
LANE: One dance would be fine.
HENRY: Great.
RORY: But -
LANE: I'll be back.
CUT TO MAX'S
[Lorelai and Max in bed]
LORELAI: Well I certainly did not come over here for that.
MAX: I know.
LORELAI: You are a wonderful man.
MAX: I know. So...what happens now.
LORELAI: I don't know. It's late. I have to get Sookie's car back.
MAX: Whoa, whoa, whoa wait a second. So this is it? You leave and we forget that this ever happened?
LORELAI: No.
MAX: Then what?
LORELAI: I leave and we go on with our lives and then at some point we buy some soup.
MAX: Lorelai...
LORELAI: What? Soup is good food.
MAX: Stop.
LORELAI: I don't want to leave here and forget this ever happened. I want to think of a solution that will make everything better. And I've been wracking my brain for an idea. Hence the babbling about soup being good food. But I can't think of anything.
MAX: I think we should talk.
LORELAI: What?
MAX: On the phone - you and me about us on a regular basis.
LORELAI: But -
MAX: We are not going to solve this staying away from each other.
LORELAI: No we're not.
MAX: And obviously we're not going to solve this by not staying away from each other.
LORELAI: But we'll burn more calories.
MAX: I want to solve this.
LORELAI: So do I.
MAX: So we'll talk?
LORELAI: We'll talk. [they kiss] Hey I thought we were supposed to be talking.
MAX: There's plenty of time for talk. [they kiss again]
CUT TO MADELINE'S
[Rory walks into a room and finds Tristin sitting at the piano]
RORY: Oh sorry.
TRISTIN: No problem.
RORY: I'm sorry.
TRISTIN: About what?
RORY: About you and Summer.
TRISTIN: I don't want to talk about Summer.
RORY: Ok. How'd you do on that biology test?
TRISTIN: What?
RORY: The test. It was hard wasn't it?
TRISTIN: Yeah it was hard.
RORY: I got a B+
TRISTIN: What are you doing?
RORY: Talking about the test.
TRISTIN: Why?
RORY: Because you said you didn't want to talk about Summer.
TRISTIN: I don't.
RORY: Ok, so I moved to biology. Sorry did you want to talk about spanish?
TRISTIN: You just loved it, didn't you?
RORY: Loved what?
TRISTIN: Seeing me get nailed like that. Must have been a great moment.
RORY: Not really.
TRISTIN: Please. You loved it, she loved it, everybody loved it.
RORY: I did not love it.
TRISTIN: I really liked her too.
RORY: Yeah I know.
TRISTIN: So where's your boyfriend tonight?
RORY: He's...not my boyfriend anymore.
TRISTIN: Why not?
RORY: He didn't want to be.
TRISTIN: Idiot.
RORY: So's Summer.
TRISTIN: You think you'll get back together?
RORY: He was pretty set in his decision.
TRISTIN: When did it happen?
RORY: Yesterday.
TRISTIN: Wow.
RORY: It was our three month anniversary.
TRISTIN: That sucks.
RORY: Yeah it does suck. Do you think you guys will?
TRISTIN: No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
RORY: So no?
TRISTIN: No. Hey, I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time for a while.
RORY: Oh that's ok.
TRISTIN: It is?
RORY: Well no, but you're sad.
TRISTIN: Yeah well. I am sorry.
RORY: I accept your apology.
TRISTIN: Oh man, it's a great party huh?
RORY: Yeah not bad. It gave me a chance to catch up on my reading.
TRISTIN: You are very odd, you know that?
RORY: Thank you.
TRISTIN: You're welcome. [he kisses her. Rory pulls away crying] I'm sorry, what did I do? Did I bite your lip or something?
RORY: No it's not you. It's just - I have to go. [runs out crying.]
[Finds Lane]
RORY: We have to go.
LANE: Rory are you ok? [turns to Henry] I have to go.
HENRY: Well wait, can I get your number?
LANE: Last name's Kim and we're the only ones in Stars Hollow. [walking away] I can't believe I just came my number to a potential Korean doctor.
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
[Lorelai walks in with a small smile on her face to find Rory sitting on the couch crying eating out of a large bucket of ice cream.]
RORY: I'm ready to wallow now.
LORELAI: Oh. [Sits on the couch next to her and kisses Rory. She puts a pillow on her lap and Rory lays down and sobs. Lorelai picks up the phone and dials] Hey Joe it's Lorelai. I need a pizza with everything ok? Thanks.

CUT TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE
[Lorelai, Rory and Grandma sitting at the dinner table]
GRANDMA: Everyone's awfully quiet tonight.
LORELAI: Sorry Mom, I'm just tired.
RORY: Me too - school.
LORELAI: Work.
RORY: Life.
LORELAI: Dig it man.
RORY: Peace out Humphrey.
GRANDMA: Mystery. [pause] Well this is just ridiculous. Three intelligent women sitting here in complete silence. There must be something to talk about. Do you know that every night at dinner, the Kennedy clan would sit around the table having lively debates about everything under the sun? They would quiz each other about current events, historical facts, intellectual trivia. Now the Gilmore clan is just as smart and worldly as the Kennedy's so come on - somebody - say something.
LORELAI: Do you know that butt models make $10,000 a day? [Rory chuckles]
GRANDMA: Camelot is truly dead.
GRANDPA: Emily!
GRANDMA: In here, just follow the crickets.
GRANDPA: I am sorry I'm late, but I come bearing wonderful news.
GRANDMA: Siri bring Mr. Gilmore a plate! [getting up and following him to his seat]
GRANDPA: I just got off the phone.
GRANDMA: Would you like to change first?
GRANDPA: No, no, no I'm fine. So I -
GRANDMA: Siri, Mr. Gilmore is hungry! [placing napkin in his lap]
GRANDPA: Emily, I am perfectly capable of putting a napkin on my lap.
GRANDMA: Alright I'm sorry. You were on the phone.
GRANDPA: Long distance.
LORELAI: God?
GRANDPA: London.
LORELAI: God lives in London?
GRANDPA: My mother lives in London.
LORELAI: Your mother is God?
GRANDPA: Lorelai.
LORELAI: So, God is a woman...
GRANDPA: Lorelai.
GRANDPA: And a relative, that's so cool. I'm gonna totally ask for favors.
GRANDPA: [to Rory] Make her stop.
RORY: Oh that I could.
GRANDMA: You spoke to your mother.
GRANDPA: Yes I did. She's fine, she sends her love and...she's coming to visit.
GRANDMA: What?
LORELAI: You're kidding?
GRANDMA: When?
RORY: I'm gonna get to meet my great-grandma?
GRANDPA: Lorelai I.
GRANDMA: When?
LORELAI: I was named after her.
RORY: I figured.
GRANDMA: Richard when?
GRANDPA: You're going to love her. My mother is brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
LORELAI: We share that also.
GRANDMA: I'm asking a question here, does no one hear me? Am I suddenly invisible?
GRANDPA: I'm sorry. What was the question?
GRANDMA: When is your mother arriving?
GRANDPA: A week from today. Rory, I'm telling you, it's going to be such a treat.
GRANDMA: Excuse me. [leaves]
LORELAI: I still can't get over that I'm related to God. It's gonna make getting Madonna tickets so much easier.
[Pan to basement]
LORELAI: Mom? Mom?
GRANDMA: It's just like that woman, no warnings, no discussions, then out of the blue I'm coming next week'.
LORELAI: What are you doing?
GRANDMA: I have to unpack these things.
LORELAI: What things? Excuse me boys [to statue of two dogs]
GRANDMA: I have to get out everything she's ever given us. 35 years worth of fish lamps and dog statues, lion tables and stupid naked angels with their...butts!
LORELAI: Whoa! Stupid naked angel butts? What did David Manic just stop by.
GRANDMA: Leave please.
LORELAI: Mom calm down.
GRANDMA: I can't calm down! That lamp shade is missing, the china is cracked and I can't remember which table it is that she gave us for our 10 year anniversary!
LORELAI: Mother, Grandma is a very old woman, I highly doubt that she's going to remember everything she ever bought you.
GRANDMA: She will remember down to the very last shrimp fork and do you know why?
LORELAI: No. [to dogs] Do you guys know why?
GRANDMA: Because she doesn't just give you a present, she gives' you a present and she tells you where to put it, how to use it, what it costs - for insurance purposes of course - and God forbid you should have a different opinion or you don't think it works in the space or you just get tired of waking up every morning with those horrifying animals staring at you!
LORELAI: [to dogs] She's just upset.
GRANDMA: Stop talking to the dogs!
LORELAI: Mom! You're freaking out. I've never seen you freak out before.
GRANDMA: Yes you have you were 12, it was the last time that horrible woman came to visit. [tries to pull a rug off a shelf.]
LORELAI: Do you want some help?
GRANDMA: No! [sighs] Please.
LORELAI: Where's it going?
GRANDMA: Third floor.
LORELAI: How about second floor?
GRANDMA: Third floor.
LORELAI: How about first floor on a ladder?
CUT TO INSIDE CAR
RORY: So tell me more about her.
LORELAI: I don't really know that much.
RORY: Well you know more than I do.
LORELAI: Well let's see. She moved to London when Grandpa died but she didn't like to travel so once a year Mom and Dad would go to visit her, usually leaving me behind, much to my relief by the way, and that's it. The rest I know from stories just like you.
RORY: Grandpa says I remind him of her.
LORELAI: That is the biggest compliment that can be wrenched out of Grumpy McFarlen believe me.
RORY: I hope she likes me.
LORELAI: She'll love you.
RORY: I hope she and Grandma get along.
LORELAI: She'll love you.
CUT TO CHILTON
[Paris, Madeline, Louise, Tristin, Rory and two other guys sitting in a circle working]
PARIS: I think that the basic structure of the Elizabethan government is relatively sound. The division of power between the monarchy, the privy council and the parliament all seem to work. Agreed?
MADELINE: Agreed.
LOUISE: Ditto.
PARIS: Ok, so in establishing our own government, I think duplicating a similar structure would be good, with a few alterations. Queen Elizabeth chose to remain unwed. She took on the burden of leadership all by herself at a time when possibly marrying the Prince of France or the King of Spain would solidify her thrown while expanding her empire. And though it obviously worked for her, and the concept of a woman ruling without man is certainly politically correct these days, I think we need to take a different tact. [in the background while Louise and Madeline talk] I think we need to devise a nation with a truly solidified royal alliance...
MADELINE: [over Paris] She does know this is a make belief government right?
LOUISE: [over Paris] You ask her, I'm afraid.
PARIS: [in foreground] So in addition to the different political branches, we'll also need a King and Queen. Rory, Tristin, what about you?
TRISTIN: Us?
RORY: Oh.
TRISTIN: No.
RORY: Yes, no.
PARIS: Why?
TRISTIN: Because..
RORY: I just don't want to be queen.
TRISTIN: Me either [pause] King - I don't want to be king.
RORY: What about you? You be queen.
PARIS: I'm going to be head of Parliament. I can't be queen.
RORY: Be both.
PARIS: I can't be both.
RORY: Why not? It's our government.
PARIS: It's not done that way.
RORY: It can be though, let's vote.
PARIS: Rory.
RORY: Henry VIII started a new church when the old one wouldn't allow divorce.
PARIS: He also cut off his wife's head. Is he still your role model?
RORY: I'm just saying we have the opportunity to make any kind of government we want here.
PARIS: Why won't you be queen?
MADELINE: I'll be queen.
RORY: There, make Madeline queen.
PARIS: Fine, you're queen, Tristin's king.
LOUISE: I'll be the lady-in-waiting. The one with the low-cut blue velvet renaissance dress.
PARIS: Lady-in-waiting is not a political office.
LOUISE: No but they get all the sex.
PARIS: What?
LOUISE: Watch a movie.
PARIS: We are talking about government class not the movies. God why can't I get one person to care about this as much as I do?!
LOUISE: Ok fine. I'll be the head of the Quarter Sessions court, but I'm still wearing the dress. Happy?
PARIS: Out of my mind. Ok, so, I secured us the class room to work tomorrow and Sunday so that by Monday we'll be ready.
MADELINE: We're working all weekend?
LOUISE: You're kidding. [Bell rings]
PARIS: Take this. It's an outline for the entire system - point of methods, some basic laws and penalties plus some random ideas. Please be ready to discuss it tomorrow 9:00 in the morning, don't be late.
MADELINE: Wow, she designed the flag.
PARIS: [in the hallway] Question.
RORY: Ok.
PARIS: What's up with you and Tristin?
RORY: What do you mean?
PARIS: You just seem weird around each other.
RORY: Nope, no weirder than usual.
PARIS: I disagree.
RORY: You usually do.
PARIS: I just think it's strange that you don't wanna be queen.
RORY: You know, not all girls want to be queen Paris. Even Barbie ended up being a stewardess.
PARIS: Ok, if you say so. Read my manifesto, I want your thoughts.
RORY: First thought - lose the word manifesto'.
PARIS: Too cabin-in-the-woods?
RORY: Don't open your mail.
PARIS: Right. How about doctrine?
RORY: Better.
PARIS: Ok, see you tomorrow.
RORY: Bye. [realizes she left her notebook and heads back to the classroom. She runs into Tristin]
TRISTIN: Uh...you left this [handing her her notebook.]
RORY: Oh yeah I did. Thanks.
TRISTIN: Sure. [both try to go through the doorway together and backup]
RORY: Well, that could have been a potential Marx Brothers moment.
TRISTIN: You go first.
RORY: Ok. [starts to exit but then turns back] I think we need to talk.
TRISTIN: About what?
RORY: Tristin you know about what?
TRISTIN: No I don't.
RORY: Look, we have a lot of work ahead of us. We also have about two and a half years of being in the same school. I don't want things to be weird between us. Don't you think it'd be good to at least try to talk about this?
TRISTIN: Ok.
RORY: Good. [They both try to go through the doorway at the same time again] I'm gonna go first.
TRISTIN: Right [chuckles]
CUT TO INN
LORELAI: Ugh! It's still not working.
MICHEL: Well you did something wrong.
LORELAI: I didn't do anything wrong. I did the same thing I always do when I'm pulling up reservations for the upcoming month but nothing happened.
MICHEL: You typed in the name?
LORELAI: I typed in the name.
MICHEL: You clicked on the April 5?
LORELAI: I clicked on the April 5.
MICHEL: You double clicked on confirmation?
LORELAI: I double clicked.
MICHEL: Are you sure?
LORELAI: Yes I double clicked.
MICHEL: You clicked twice.
LORELAI: No I double clicked but I didn't click twice.
MICHEL: Because to successfully double click you must click twice.
LORELAI: I know what double click is.
MICHEL: Well apparently you do not or we wouldn't be having this conversation.
LORELAI: Ooh, I'm going to pinch you so hard right now.
MICHEL: Well I don't know what you have done!
LORELAI: Well - ah! [as Michel pushes her out of the way]
MICHEL: Well I can't fix it if you don't move.
LORELAI: I double clicked. [as Michel starts to type] Ooh, what's that?
MICHEL: What?
LORELAI: That flashy red thing [speaks at the same time as Michel] with an x' through it.
MICHEL: [speaks at the same time as Lorelai] I do not know.
LORELAI: Ooh, it happened when you pushed something funky.
MICHEL: I pushed nothing funky'.
LORELAI: You have the funk my friend. [phone rings] Independence Inn.
GRANDMA: I need the hat rack.
LORELAI: [whispers] The fish flies at night.
GRANDMA: What?
LORELAI: I don't know, who is this?
GRANDMA: This is your mother.
LORELAI: Oh well hi Mom, I didn't recognize your voice.
GRANDMA: I need the hat rack back.
LORELAI: What hat rack?
GRANDMA: The hat rack I gave you.
LORELAI: What hat rack?
GRANDMA: The hat rack I gave you for Christmas five years ago.
LORELAI: Uh, well...
GRANDMA: It's large, bronze with dragons or weasels - I don't know, some sort of lizard type animal that you hang your coats on.
LORELAI: Yes, yes, I remember it.
GRANDMA: Thank God. I need it back.
LORELAI: You need a Christmas present back?
GRANDMA: Temporarily.
LORELAI: Why Mom?
GRANDMA: I need it back because Richard's mother gave it to us and she'll notice if it's not there.
LORELAI: You gave me a used present?
GRANDMA: No, we never used it.
LORELAI: I can't believe it.
GRANDMA: You'll get it back.
LORELAI: You gave me a second hand present, like something you got at the junk store.
GRANDMA: You're being a little dramatic. It was still in the crate.
LORELAI: You actually went Huh, what should I get Lorelai this year. You know what, I can't be bothered. Let's give her something we don't want anymore.'
GRANDMA: You're not funny.
LORELAI: What would Miss Manners say about this?
GRANDMA: If she met your grandmother she'd understand. Now please, just bring the rack with you when you come tonight ok?
LORELAI: [sighing] Ok, sure.
GRANDMA: Thank you.
LORELAI: You're welcome. Bye.
CUT TO OUTSIDE CHILTON
TRISTIN: [sighs] So we're supposed to talk.
RORY: Yeah. Look about the other night.
TRISTIN: Look, I was upset over Summer.
RORY: Yes and I was upset over Dean.
TRISTIN: So, then it doesn't mean anything right?
RORY: Right.
TRISTIN: So then - right, so then that's it. We just chalk it up to a bad night.
RORY: Ok. I'm sorry I cried.
TRISTIN: No problem.
RORY: I swear it had nothing to do with the kiss.
TRISTIN: I kissed you, you cried. That had to do something with the kiss.
RORY: No, I cried because I was confused. Because I hadn't cried. I didn't cry because of the kiss. It was a nice kiss.
TRISTIN: Yeah?
RORY: Very nice. Not at all crying material.
TRISTIN: Really?
RORY: Absolutely.
TRISTIN: Wanna try it again?
RORY: Well I think someone's recovering from their heartbreak just fine.
TRISTIN: Yeah I'm all better. [small pause] I think I'm going to swear off girls for a while.
RORY: Ha!
TRISTIN: What?
RORY: Uh, sorry, nothing. You said you were going to swear off girls - it's funny.
TRISTIN: You don't think I can?
RORY: No I think you can, I just think it would be hard for you. It'd probably involve some kind of lock up facility, one of those Hannibal Lector masks.
TRISTIN: Ok yes, it would be hard but not impossible.
RORY: Maybe it's not so much swearing off all girls but swearing off a certain kind of girl.
TRISTIN: Meaning?
RORY: Meaning next time maybe you should pick a girl with a little more substance. You know, a girl who's smart and is driven and has ambition. You know like Paris.
TRISTIN: Are you serious?
RORY: Yeah why not? Paris is smart and cute and interesting and yes she does bring her own unique set of baggage into the mix.
TRISTIN: A matching set.
RORY: But she likes you. She's crazy about you. She thinks you're amazing.
TRISTIN: You want me to date Paris?
RORY: Just think about it.
TRISTIN: [exhales loudly] Me and Paris.
RORY: Louis, I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.
TRISTIN: Who's Louis?
RORY: Just think. [leaves]
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE.
LORELAI: [sighs] Come on, let's go.
RORY: Relax, I'm almost ready.
LORELAI: We're gonna be late.
RORY: No we're not.
LORELAI: Well it's Friday night and traffic's bad on Friday night.
RORY: Since when?
LORELAI: Since the beginning of time. Here let me do that. [puts on necklace for Rory]
RORY: What's up with you?
LORELAI: Nothing.
RORY: You've been ready and bugging me for almost an hour. Usually I have to drag you out of here kicking and screaming to go to dinner.
LORELAI: Now then.
RORY: You whine, you complain, you act like a child.
LORELAI: I do not.
RORY: I had to pay you five bucks once so you wouldn't go in sweats.
LORELAI: Make your point and make it fast, as we move quickly to the front door.
RORY: My point is that you are mean.
LORELAI: I am not mean.
RORY: You are. You want to go to dinner to see Grandma uncomfortable, that's mean.
LORELAI: Oh, ok, look. I will admit, I work very hard and sometimes I am a little tired come Friday night for the Gilmore family dinner. But I had a light day today and my grandmother who I have not seen for years is going to be there.
RORY: And it has nothing to do with the fact that Grandma hates Great-grandma?
LORELAI: Not at all.
RORY: And when you see Grandma miserable and uncomfortable you're going to be sad and sympathetic?
LORELAI: Not at all.
RORY: Mean.
LORELAI: I'm kidding.
RORY: I want you to be nice.
LORELAI: I will be nice.
RORY: And no outward reveling in someone else's pain.
LORELAI: I promise, internal reveling only.
RORY: Ok then, we can go.
LORELAI: Ok good. Oh wait [grabs a camera] So the internal reveling can continue for years to come.
RORY: Mean.
LORELAI: Ha!
CUT TO INSIDE CAR
[Lorelai starts to laugh to herself.]
RORY: Mean, mean, mean.
CUT TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE
[Lorelai and Rory are carrying the hat rack]
RORY: God, this thing weighs like a 1000 pounds.
LORELAI: I know, I know. Here, put down.
RORY: What are we doing?
LORELAI: Well, in case Gran comes to the door you know.
RORY: Good thinking.
LORELAI: I mean she's 80. The eyes have got to be gone right?
RORY: Let's just try to keep her inside the house.
LORELAI: Good thinking [knocks]
GRANDMA: Do you have it?
LORELAI: We got it.
GRANDMA: Hurry up, bring it in here.
LORELAI: Ah!
RORY: Sorry.
GRANDMA: Ok, quiet, be quiet.
LORELAI: Ok mom, thanks for the direction and all but, um, we need some help.
GRANDMA: Oh yeah sorry.
LORELAI: [to Rory] Careful honey.
GRANDMA: Watch it, watch your head. Get it over here. Ok yes, yeah I think that was about - no I think it was maybe a little more on the left. Oh God I should have put tape down.
LORELAI: Mom, you don't think that the coat rack could've moved a quarter of an inch in five years?
GRANDMA: Yeah you're right. That's it. Ok, put your coats on it.
LORELAI: How'd you get her in here without her noticing it wasn't there?
GRANDMA: Well I brought her in through the back way then I had Stella wax the floors, also she napped so that took up about an hour.
RORY: Where is she now?
GRANDMA: In the living room scratching the diamond pendant I bought her against a mirror.
LORELAI: So we shouldn't keep her waiting huh?
GRANDMA: No you're right, we shouldn't. Oh, heaven help me! [they head for the living room. Lorelai chuckles.]
RORY: Stop.
GRANDMA: Mom, look who's here?
TRIX: Who?
GRANDMA: Well, look.
TRIX: If I wanted to look, I would look. I haven't looked therefore you must draw your own conclusions. Ah, thank you, dear boy. [Grandpa gives her a drink]
GRANDPA: You're welcome Trix.
RORY: Trix?
LORELAI: Dad's pet name for Gran.
GRANDMA: Isn't it just darling?
LORELAI: Hi Gran.
TRIX: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Yes, it's so good to see you again.
GRANDPA: Trix, this is Rory. You haven't met her yet.
TRIX: No, I don't believe I have.
RORY: Hello.
TRIX: Come. I want to get a very good look at both of you. They're tall.
GRANDPA: Well yes they are.
TRIX: How's your health?
LORELAI: Oh, good.
RORY: Very healthy.
LORELAI: Mm-hmm.
TRIX: Good. That means that the majority of your blood is Gilmore blood. Gilmore's don't get sick. Am I right Richard?
GRANDPA: Oh we wouldn't dare Trix.
TRIX: That's right. Your mother is always sick.
GRANDMA: I'm hardly always sick.
TRIX: You're sick right now.
LORELAI: Are you sick now Mom?
GRANDMA: Headache.
TRIX: Gilmore's don't have headaches, our heads are perfect. You don't drink?
LORELAI: Uh, well...
TRIX: Emily, get this woman a drink.
GRANDPA: Oh I'll do it.
LORELAI: Oh thanks Dad. White wine.
GRANDMA: I'm going to go get the hors d'ouevres.
TRIX: So you're Rory.
RORY: Yes ma'am.
TRIX: My son speaks of you constantly. He seems very fond of you.
RORY: Oh well I'm very fond of him too.
GRANDPA: This little girl is as smart as a whip Mom. I think she has a great deal of you in her.
TRIX: Really?
GRANDPA: Mm-hmm.
TRIX: How nice. [Grandma enters with a tray of cheese] Is this cheese?
GRANDMA: Yes it is.
TRIX: Am I supposed to eat that cheese?
GRANDMA: Well only if you like.
GRANDPA: Emily, where are those spiced nuts that Trix likes so much?
GRANDMA: I'll get some.
TRIX: So Lorelai, since I've seen you last, you've grown up, gotten pregnant out of wedlock, raised a child and still haven't bothered to get married. Have I left anything out?
LORELAI: Well sometime in between growing up and getting pregnant, I got my ears pierced.
TRIX: I've always hated a scandal. However I've always appreciated self-sufficiency. Tell me, how do you support this child?
LORELAI: I run an inn.
TRIX: Hard work?
LORELAI: Yes it is.
TRIX: Good. Hard work is good for a woman - makes her stronger. I admire people who enjoy hard work.
GRANDMA: Here we go, spiced nuts.
TRIX: Thank you Emily. I suppose I can just put these nuts in my hand.
GRANDMA: I'll be right back.
LORELAI: So Gran, um, when was the last time I saw you?
TRIX: You were still in your teens, wild hair flying everywhere. I see you've taken care of that.
LORELAI: Yes, I joined a support group, bought a hair brush and just taking it one day at a time.
TRIX: That was a joke?
LORELAI: Yes it is.
TRIX: Very good.
LORELAI: Thank you.
GRANDMA: I have dishes and napkins.
TRIX: Good for you. Richard, I would like to be escorted into the dining room now.
GRANDPA: Your wish is my command.
GRANDMA: Well, uh, I'm not sure that dinner is ready just yet.
TRIX: Well perhaps our presence in the dining room will teach your help that when one is told dinner is at 7:00, people often expects dinner at 7:00.
GRANDMA: But it's only five after Mom.
TRIX: Only five after? Richard, in the even that I am kidnapped and a ransom is demanded at a certain time, I would prefer that Emily not be in charge of the drop off. [Lorelai and Rory get up and follow. Lorelai gives Emily a what can you do' shoulder shrug]
[Pan to later that evening.]
RORY: Grandma, this dinner's delicious.
TRIX: Very good young lady, well all believe you. Now, let's talk about your education. Where are you attending school?
RORY: Chilton.
GRANDPA: Rory is in the top ten percent of her class.
GRANDMA: We're very proud of our Rory. She's going to Harvard.
TRIX: Harvard?
RORY: Yes ma'am.
TRIX: Richard, how can you allow this girl to go to Harvard?!
GRANDPA: Now Trix -
TRIX: You're a Yale man, your father was a Yale man!
LORELAI: Well we want Rory to be whatever kind of man she wants to be.
TRIX: That's enough jokes for this evening Lorelai.
LORELAI: Sorry.
TRIX: Now if you don't mind my asking, Chilton is rather an expensive institution, I'm curious how the manager of an inn can afford such a luxury?
LORELAI: Ah well...
GRANDMA: We're helping Lorelai out a little.
GRANDPA: Yes, we've seen to it that Rory's education is taken care of.
LORELAI: But it's temporary. It's a loan. I plan to pay them back every cent. They know this.
TRIX: That's it, I'm done. Richard. Tomorrow, Rory, I shall plan the menu. When you've lived in Europe you learn a thing or two about food.
RORY: Oh, I can't. I'm studying tomorrow. I'm in a study group and our presentation is due on Monday
TRIX: Oh very well, your mother can tell you all about it.
LORELAI: I will, I promise.
GRANDMA: Won't you have dessert?
TRIX: I once traveled to a small village in Cambodia, I did not eat dessert there either.
CUT TO CHILTON
[Louise is laying across several desks with her eyes closed]
LOUISE: What time is it?
MADELINE: It's almost nine. Hey maybe I'll own a magazine some day. Then I'll get all my nail polish for free.
LOUISE: I'm going back to sleep. Tell Paris I hate her.
MADELINE: Ok.
PARIS: Hi.
MADELINE: Hey Paris. Louise hates you.
PARIS: You'll thank me when you get into Sarah Lawrence.
LOUISE: Wanna bet?
RORY: Hey.
MADELINE: Wow, did you bring coffee?
RORY: And doughnuts in the shape of clowns.
MADELINE: Hey they've got hats.
RORY: Well a clown just isn't a clown without a hat. [to Paris] Here is your decaf with soy milk.
PARIS: Thanks.
RORY: You're welcome. So I read your doctrine and I thing our imaginary kingdom is off to a pretty good start.
PARIS: Yeah?
RORY: Yeah. I mean the taxes are a little high and the landowner's power should be regulated a little more.
PARIS: It was a different time back then.
RORY: Yeah but the fundamental human needs were the same.
PARIS: We're supposed to set it up within -
LOUISE: Ding, ding, ding. No debating until I've had coffee.
MADELINE: And a clown.
TRISTIN: Ladies.
MADELINE: Hi Tristin.
RORY: Hey.
TRISTIN: Paris, can I talk to you for a sec?
LORELAI: Oh, sure ok.
LOUISE: And that is about what pray tell?
MADELINE: I don't know. The project - maybe?
LOUISE: They could've talked project here. It's something else. Something private.
MADELINE: Scandal.
LOUISE: Maybe. Though it is Paris.
MADELINE: Scandal lite.
LOUISE: All the taste, but much fewer calories.
MADELINE: We could spy.
RORY: Or we could wait for her to come back in to see if she wants us to know.
LOUISE: Those who simply wait for information to find them, spend a lot of time sitting by the phone. Those who go out and find it themselves, have something to say when it rings.
RORY: Nietzsche?
LOUISE: Dawson.
RORY: My next guess. [Paris comes back in.]
LOUISE: So, what was with the confab in the hallway?
MADELINE: We're dying here.
PARIS: Well, Tristin, he...asked me out.
MADELINE: No!
LOUISE: My, my, my.
MADELINE: Wow, this is amazing. God I'm jealous.
LOUISE: Details please. Don't leave out anything. We want every comma, apostrophe and ampersand.
PARIS: Well he just asked me out.
MADELINE: When?
PARIS: Tonight.
LOUISE: Hmm.
PARIS: What?
LOUISE: Nothing.
PARIS: No, you hmm'ed. Why did you hmm'?
LOUISE: Forget it.
PARIS: Louise tell me why you hmm'ed.
LOUISE: He asked you out for tonight.
MADELINE: Less than 24 hours notice.
PARIS: So? What does that mean?
LOUISE: Usually that someone else cancelled.
RORY: Or maybe he just got up the nerve to ask her out.
MADELINE: Maybe.
LOUISE: This is so amazing. I mean you are so far from Tristin's type.
MADELINE: So, so far.
LOUISE: Tristin usually likes his girls bad.
MADELINE: Looks like we're going to have to do the Pink Ladies makeover on you.
LOUISE: We'll turn you from a sweet Sandy to a sluty Sandy. Dancing at the school fair with high heels, black spandex and permed hair.
MADELINE: You can borrow my water bra.
PARIS: Excuse me?
MADELINE: My water bra. It's like a padded bra but it's filled with some sort of liquid so it moves.
PARIS: It moves?
MADELINE: Yeah.
PARIS: On it's own?
MADELINE: It makes you look natural.
PARIS: Great. Thanks, but I'll pass. Everyone come on, let's get to work.
RORY: I think you're gonna have a really good time.
PARIS: Yeah well, it's just a date right?
RORY: Oh, right.
PARIS: Ok, focus people.
RORY: Do you want one? [point at the clowns]
CUT TO GILMORE HOUSE
LORELAI: [running into the house and upstairs] Hi! Five minute talking break while I change. [upstairs] My day - big leak third floor, lots of things going squish that should not be squishing. Michel is not help. And now I'm late for dinner which by the way I'm completely bummed you're not coming to - [holding up shirts] which one - blue, black, good, bad?
RORY: Black.
LORELAI: Ok. Are you sure you can't come?
RORY: Yeah I'm sure. If I'm not prepared tomorrow, Paris is gonna have me sent to the Tower. Although if things go well tonight, I bet it'll help tomorrow.
LORELAI: Tonight?
RORY: Yeah, she's going out on a date with Tristin.
LORELAI: How'd that happen?
RORY: I did a little matchmaking.
LORELAI: [in Ricki Ricardo voice] Lucy, how many times have I told you not to butt into there people's business?
RORY: Never.
LORELAI: [normal voice] Good going.
RORY: That's all.
LORELAI: Alright, well I want details tomorrow now how do I look?
RORY: Beautiful.
LORELAI: [sighs] Ok. My five minutes are up. [grabbing shoes] Let's go. [going downstairs] There is money on the kitchen table and there's really good chocolate cake that I took out and defrosted for you specially this morning and call me if you need me and I'll be home early and what else?
RORY: Don't be mean to Grandma.
LORELAI: Yeah, yeah broken record. Ok, I'm gone.
RORY: Be good.
LORELAI: Bye.
RORY: Bye.
[Pan to later, Rory studying and eating cake. Knock]
PARIS: [holding clothes] I don't know what to wear.
RORY: Ever?
PARIS: On my date with Tristin. I'm not trendy girl ok? I don't haunt the boutiques hoping to find that one fabulous little top. I study and then I think about studying and then I study some more.
RORY: Do you want to come in?
PARIS: I only have one lipstick at home ok? And it's barely even a color. You put it on and it looks like you're not wearing anything which is why I liked it in the first place. But to date you need the fabulous little top and you need a lipstick that you can actually tell you're wearing.
RORY: Do you want to put that stuff down?
PARIS: You said once that if I ever needed to talk to anymore I could come talk to you.
RORY: Yes I did.
PARIS: Well here I am.
RORY: Ok, can I ask you a question?
PARIS: Ok.
RORY: Why didn't you go to Madeline or Louise about this? I mean they seem to get that fabulous little top' thing.
PARIS: Oh yeah that they get. The whole supportive You're going to be fine and not throw up 12 times on the way to his car' thing - that they don't get.
RORY: Ok, let's just see what you got.
PARIS: I brought everything just in case there was some sort of hidden potential in something that I just didn't see. So?
RORY: Well you'd be one well dressed widow.
PARIS: Forget it. I'm not going.
RORY: Yes you are. Come on now. This is your entire wardrobe?
PARIS: Yes.
RORY: Nothing's left at home.
PARIS: Nothing but my Chilton uniform and my bat mitzvah dress which has menorahs on the collar.
RORY: Ok let's think. Come on. [going upstairs]
PARIS: Where are you going?
RORY: to our one stop shopping store.
[Upstairs in Lorelai's room.]
PARIS: Is this your mother's room?
RORY: Yes it is.
PARIS: I can't wear your mother's clothes.
RORY: Yes you can, I do it all the time. What about this? [holding up pink blouse]
PARIS: My mother says the color pink makes my head look small.
RORY: Ok, no pink.
PARIS: This whole thing is so insane.
RORY: Why?
PARIS: Tristin asking me out? Why would he do that?
RORY: Why would he not do that?
PARIS: Because he's gorgeous and experienced and only dates those most likely to become a trophy wife.
RORY: Tristin would be lucky to go out with someone like you. He's not going to have to read the menu to you or explain that the dancing trash bins in the movie theatre previews aren't real. It's going to be much less stressful.
PARIS: All these years I've hoped this would happen and now it has and I feel...I don't know. I don't have a lot of experience in the dating department. I mean if you can't put it on your transcript what's the point right?
RORY: I know. Before Dean I'd never had a boyfriend. Or a kiss.
PARIS: Yeah.
RORY: I never even thought about dating.
PARIS: Then you met Dean.
RORY: Yeah. And he was so special and nice and made me completely nauseous.
PARIS: The best ones do.
RORY: I couldn't even talk around him.
PARIS: I saw you at the dance. You didn't seem to have any trouble talking. Or gazing annoyingly into each others eyes.
RORY: But that was after we'd been dating a little. After we started going out and spending time together, I don't know, it just kind of got easier. And then by the third date everything was perfect.
PARIS: Do you miss him a lot?
RORY: Yeah, a lot, a lot.
PARIS: Sorry.
RORY: Thanks. But tonight is not about me. Tonight is about you going out with Tristin in this outfit. What do you think?
PARIS: It's ok. [Rory gives her a look] It's great.
RORY: Put it on.
PARIS: Are you sure?
RORY: Yeah. Bathroom's down the hall and I'll get you a lipstick with some actual color in it.
PARIS: Ok. [throws her jacket on the bed and note cards fall out of it.]
RORY: Uh, Paris. What are these cards that fell out of your jacket?
PARIS: Oh yeah. Those are notes for tonight.
RORY: Notes?
PARIS: Yeah. Just some reference points really - you know subjects to bring up in case the conversation lags.
RORY: Well can I suggest that you leave this one about the Spanish Inquisition out?
PARIS: It's not very romantic?
RORY: Not really.
PARIS: Ok, I'm dressed.
RORY: How's it look?
PARIS: Bad.
RORY: Well I don't really trust your opinion on that subject so come out here please.
PARIS: Fine but it looks bad. [opens bathroom door]
RORY: You look great!
PARIS: I feel weird.
RORY: Well then weird works for you because you look amazing.
PARIS: Really? You're not just saying that?
RORY: I swear to God.
PARIS: Are you atheist?
RORY: Excuse me?
PARIS: Because that affects the validity of your swearing to God.
RORY: You look great. And I wouldn't tell you you did if you didn't.
PARIS: Ok, well if you think it looks ok.
RORY: I believe the word amazing' was used.
PARIS: Then I'll wear it. Thanks.
RORY: Anytime.
PARIS: I have to go.
RORY: Lipstick.
PARIS: You're going to hold this evening over my head for the rest of my life aren't you?
RORY: Probably.
PARIS: Bye.



CUT TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE
TRIX: What did you think about the rabbit?
LORELAI: Oh, I thought it was wonderful.
TRIX: You know I brought it with me.
LORELAI: Excuse me?
TRIX: From London. London has the best game.
GRANDPA: Mm.
LORELAI: You brought it with you from London?
TRIX: Yes.
LORELAI: What, did you get it a seat?
GRANDMA: Dry ice.
LORELAI: Wow! That's inventive.
TRIX: Well it looks like we're finished here.
GRANDPA: Let's retire to the living room for a brandy.
TRIX: Yes. Lorelai, walk with me. I have something that I want to discuss with you.
LORELAI: Ok.
TRIX: I've been thinking about something I heard the other night.
LORELAI: What was that?
TRIX: That you borrowed money from your parents for Rory's school.
LORELAI: Well if you're worried about them getting the money back -
TRIX: You know Shakespeare once wrote Neither a borrower nor a lender be'. Do you consider Shakespeare a wise man?
LORELAI: Uh, sure, yeah.
GRANDMA: We certainly don't mind loaning Lorelai the money if that's what you're worried about.
GRANDPA: Certainly not. Rory is first priority in this house.
TRIX: I'm not concerned about whether you mind or not. Loaning money is a dirty business. It's distasteful and I don't care for it. As you know, I came into town to check up on the family investments and to talk with our lawyers. I have some things to put in order, and one of them is setting up a trust fund for Rory.
LORELAI: Wh - that's amazing. Really?
TRIX: Now normally I would set up a fund that she would have access to when she's 25. However, considering the situation, if you like, I will arrange for her to get it now.
LORELAI: Now?!
GRANDMA: Now?!
TRIX: That way she can use it to pay for Chilton.
LORELAI: Oh Gran, I don't know what to say, that is so generous of you.
GRANDPA: My mother is a very special woman isn't she?
TRIX: You talk about me like I'm dead.
GRANDPA: Oh you're never going to die! You're too stubborn!
LORELAI: Gran this is - I don't know what to say.
TRIX: Nothing now would be preferable. I have arranged for you and your mother and I to have tea tomorrow before I leave. Say it then. Good night Emily.
GRANDMA: Good night.
GRANDPA: Well I'll just uh, walk mother upstairs and be right back.
LORELAI: Wow! That was quite a b*mb she just dropped.
GRANDMA: It certainly was.
LORELAI: God! Um, I guess I should be going. Thanks for dinner Mom. I'll see you tomorrow. [leaves]
GRANDMA: Lorelai...[follows her to foyer] You're not honestly considering accepting that money are you?
LORELAI: Um yeah, of course I'm considering it.
GRANDMA: I don't think that's very wise.
LORELAI: Why not?
GRANDMA: Because she's a young girl. She won't know the first thing about managing that money.
LORELAI: Yeah, well, I'll help her.
GRANDMA: You don't know the first thing about managing that money either.
LORELAI: No, but I've very familiar with the second thing.
GRANDMA: How can you not see the pitfalls in accepting that money?
LORELAI: Mom.
GRANDMA: I mean you're the one that brags about how special your relationship with Rory is. I'm stunned that you want to jeopardize it like this.
LORELAI: What are you talking about?
GRANDMA: Well you know as well as I do that money is freedom.
LORELAI: And?
GRANDMA: If Rory has that money she won't need you anymore.
LORELAI: I don't know Mom, she's 16. There's still a couple of ways I might come in handy, you know buying the beer that kind of stuff.
GRANDMA: Well I'm glad you thing losing your daughter is so funny.
LORELAI: Mom.
GRANDMA: She'll be self sufficient, she won't need you to pay for anything, she won't have to turn to you.
LORELAI: Everything in a relationship isn't about money mom.
GRANDMA: She'll move out as soon as she can.
LORELAI: So what.
GRANDMA: She won't need your help to put her through college, she won't need you to buy a car.
LORELAI: Ok you know what? Say goodbye to Dad for me as soon as the voices in your head subside.
GRANDMA: Why should she wait to backpack around Europe with you? She could afford to go herself. And she could take a friend or a boyfriend or anyone.
LORELAI: Yeah well she wants to go with me.
GRANDMA: Well now of course she does she doesn't have options. But the minute you give her options...
LORELAI: Ok, that's it. You're nuts and I'm going - in that order. [leaves]
GRANDMA: It's terrible not to be needed. You'll see!
[Pan to Gilmore house, Lorelai walks in and goes into Rory's room to find her asleep. She takes away the books from Rory and covers her. She holds up a Harvard brochure and we see Rory's room has posters of places from Europe up.]
CUT TO STREET
[Sookie and Lorelai at flower shop]
SOOKIE: That is amazing!
LORELAI: I know. One minute it's pass the pot roast' the next minute it's hey, here's have a pile of money'. Things are never boring at the Gilmore house.
SOOKIE: What did Rory say when you told her?
LORELAI: I haven't told her yet.
SOOKIE: What?!
LORELAI: She was asleep when I got home.
SOOKIE: Hi, for that much money you wake her up! You hire a singing telegram! Women jump out of cakes! People dress up like bankers and dance around with those toasters!
LORELAI: Well she's been working her butt off all week on this Chilton paper, so I let her sleep and I'll tell her tonight.
SOOKIE: Call her now. Ooh, page her, or page her and have her call my cell phone and we can sing the money song from Cabaret'. You be Liza, I'll be Joel.
LORELAI: I don't know.
SOOKIE: Hey I'm Joel.
LORELAI: I don't want to bother her while she's at school. I can never decide, carnations tacky or trendy?
SOOKIE: You don't want to tell her.
LORELAI: Yeah I do. I think.
SOOKIE: Oh well I understand the hesitation.
LORELAI: You do?
SOOKIE: Absolutely. I mean who wants to be the bearer of good news. All that hugging and happiness - nightmare.
LORELAI: I was, I was thrilled when Gran told me about it and I was going to tell Rory about it right away.
SOOKIE: But?
LORELAI: My mother...
SOOKIE: Ah.
LORELAI: ...cornered me by the door saying all this stuff about how when Rory gets the money she's not going to need me and she's gonna move out of the house sooner.
SOOKIE: What? That's crazy!
LORELAI: I know it is, it's crazy and yet...
SOOKIE: Honey come on. The woman's just trying to mess with your mind, you know that.
LORELAI: I do.
SOOKIE: She just doesn't want to lose control of you. She wants you to be permanently obligated to her.
LORELAI: I know, I know that.
SOOKIE: So then what? You don't believe what she said do you?
LORELAI: I don't know. I mean you're right - what you're saying about she wants to mess with my mind and make me feel obligated but I mean, what if the money does change our relationship?
SOOKIE: Impossible.
LORELAI: Well anything's possible.
SOOKIE: Come on.
LORELAI: I couldn't stand that. I like things the way they are now.
SOOKIE: Lorelai, this is Rory we're talking about.
LORELAI: I know.
SOOKIE: She's like the most unmaterialistic kid in the world.
LORELAI: Not it's not about what she would buy. I don't care if she buys a house or a boat or the elephant man's bones. It's just that - you know, it's about the freedom. I mean if I had access to all that money as a kid I would have left the house so fast.
SOOKIE: Faster than 17?
LORELAI: No I mean - God I know this is crazy. I have my mother's voice stuck in my head. It's like that annoying Cranberries song. I hate that I let her do this! I have that I let her get to me!
SOOKIE: Well then don't let her. Call Rory and tell her about the money and you'll see that nothing will be any different.
LORELAI: I don't want her to go to Europe without me. That was going to be our thing.
SOOKIE: She's not going to go without you. I promise.
LORELAI: Hey - [looks at Sookie's watch] Aw! No! I've got to go home.
SOOKIE: Why? What are you doing?
LORELAI: I have to change and go to tea with Gran and the cast of Gaslight'.
SOOKIE: Wow, I'll see you later.
LORELAI: Bye.
CUT TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE
GRANDPA: You're hysterical, I can't talk to you when you're hysterical.
GRANDMA: Well you make me hysterical.
GRANDPA: I am tired of fighting about this.
GRANDMA: You have to got to get her to take that offer back.
GRANDPA: No.
GRANDMA: Richard Gilmore I have put up with a lot from this woman over the years...
GRANDPA: Keep your voice down.
GRANDMA: But this time she's gone too far!
GRANDPA: Emily please.
GRANDMA: I can go louder!
GRANDPA: If I do as you ask, I'll be insulting my mother. I will not do that.
GRANDMA: Now you listen to me. I don't care if she demeans me and looks down on me. I don't care if she thinks I've tarnished the Gilmore name. I don't care if she thinks I'm the whore of Babylon. I've long ago given up any hope of getting into her psychotic good graces, but that woman is horrible and selfish. And she's not going to get away with it. I won't let her.
GRANDPA: This is my mother you're talking about.
GRANDMA: Yes it is. Your mother, the one who stepped in without being asked and single-handedly wrecked everything!
GRANDPA: Emily, what is this about?
GRANDMA: She'll never come back here you know.
GRANDPA: Who? Mother, of course she will she -
GRANDMA: Lorelai.
GRANDPA: What?
GRANDMA: If she gets that money, Lorelai will never come back here. She won't have to.
TRIX: I've ordered a car, women shouldn't drive. Are you ready? [heads for the door]
GRANDMA: Yes I'm ready. [looks at Richard]
TRIX: I shall die soon you know!
CUT TO CHILTON
[Rory sitting outside classroom]
PARIS: Well aren't we early. Trying to suck up to Parliament?
RORY: Hey how'd it go last night?
PARIS: It went.
RORY: It went well?
PARIS: Well he picked me up. We went to dinner and a movie. I didn't use my note cards once and he kissed me good night.
RORY: Paris I'm so glad!
PARIS: It was a great kiss.
RORY: See? All that nervousness for nothing.
PARIS: Yeah. God this is so weird. I can't stop smiling.
RORY: Good, then it's a good time to talk about our over taxed peasants.
PARIS: Oh let them eat cake.
TRISTIN: [walking by them] Hey.
RORY: Don't look at me. I didn't kiss you.
[Paris follows him in.]
PARIS: Hi.
TRISTIN: Hey.
PARIS: I just wanted to tell you again that I had so much fun last night.
TRISTIN: Yeah, after five messages on my answering machine, I kinda got that impression.
PARIS: Too much, sorry.
TRISTIN: No forget it, it was cute.
PARIS: You know, maybe we could do it again sometime. I mean a different movie of course but the same basic plan.
TRISTIN: Absolutely.
PARIS: Great, because it was really fun.
TRISTIN: It was fun and we should do it again. I mean you know - as friends.
PARIS: Oh, yeah as friends. [disappointed]
TRISTIN: You noticed it too right? That we're sort of more friends material than dating material?
PARIS: Yes I did notice. I have excellent deductive k*ll.
TRISTIN: But hey, I'm glad we did it.
PARIS: Oh sure.
TRISTIN: When Rory first suggested us going out I thought the idea was crazy but she made some good points. We do have some history and well, you never know right?
PARIS: Yes you never know. Ok, so we're done here right?
TRISTIN: Uh sure.
PARIS: Great. Excuse me. [walks over to Rory who just entered classroom]
RORY: What?
PARIS: It was your idea?
RORY: Paris.
PARIS: So what, I get all your cast offs now?! I'm just that pathetic?! Jee I don't want them so maybe I can con the suckers into taking out Paris the loser'! Throw the dog a bone!
RORY: Ok let me -
PARIS: I am not your charity case!
RORY: No it's not like that, I swear. I just thought you guys would make a good couple that's all.
PARIS: We did make a good couple - for one night! But obviously we're more suited to just being friends or at least that was what was conveyed so humiliatingly to me just five seconds ago.
RORY: Paris, I'm sorry -
PARIS: I hate you! [storms out and Madeline and Louise who came in and caught the tail end follow her]
RORY: [goes up to Tristin] You told her?
TRISTIN: I didn't know it was a secret.
RORY: Why would you tell her? What is wrong with you?!
TRISTIN: Rory relax, we tried ok, it didn't work out, it's not big deal.
RORY: It's a huge deal to Paris and you didn't try. One date isn't trying.
TRISTIN: Rory -
RORY: You said you'd try.
TRISTIN: Hey, I'm sorry Paris is upset ok? But is it better that I keep dating her even thought I like somebody else?
RORY: Oh.
TRISTIN: Yeah.
RORY: I didn't realize. So...you're still not over Summer huh?
TRISTIN: [semi-sarcastically] Yeah, I'm not over Summer yet. [leaves, Rory looks confused or feels bad for him]
CUT TO TEA
LORELAI: Hi.
GRANDMA: Hello.
LORELAI: Where's Gran?
GRANDMA: Torturing the bathroom attendant I suppose.
LORELAI: Ah. So um, this place seems clean.
GRANDMA: Yes, it's famous for it's cleanliness. So what did Rory say when you told her? About the money I mean. She must have been very excited.
LORELAI: Yes she was. Rose tea. That's funny. That's not really tea is it? It's like rose petals in hot water. More like a bad floral arrangement.
GRANDMA: Well what did Rory say, fill me in?
LORELAI: She was happy.
GRANDMA: Happy?
LORELAI: Yeah - she screamed she did that air-lasso thing over her head.
GRANDMA: Lorelai be serious.
LORELAI: She was asleep when I got home Mom so I couldn't tell her.
GRANDMA: She doesn't know?
LORELAI: No.
GRANDMA: Well...something I said must've really struck a chord with you.
LORELAI: Excuse me?
GRANDMA: You didn't tell her so you must have had a reason.
LORELAI: Ah she was asleep Mom, I just told you that.
GRANDMA: The only thing I can think of is that you must have reconsidered based on our conversation.
LORELAI: I didn't reconsider.
GRANDMA: I mean yesterday you could hardly wait to get home to announce your great fortune to her. Today all you can talk about is rose petal tea.
LORELAI: Yes well, it's a little weird.
GRANDMA: And you haven't told her that now she has her own money to put herself through school, to go to Europe -
LORELAI: Stop right now. This is just like you to take something that should be great and twist it into something ugly. Why do you do that? What is wrong with you?
GRANDMA: There's nothing wrong with me.
LORELAI: Yes there is. There's something seriously wrong with you. You should be studied.
GRANDMA: I don't understand why you're getting so upset. I respect the decision that you made.
LORELAI: I made no decision.
GRANDMA: Whatever you say.
LORELAI: Ok, you know what? I'm going to call her and uh, tell her right now. [looks for her cell]
GRANDMA: No you're not.
LORELAI: Yes in fact I am. [moving phone around her]
GRANDMA: What are you doing?
LORELAI: The reception sucks in here.
GRANDMA: Stop it, you look like you're having a fit.
LORELAI: Ok, well I'm gonna go find a payphone. [gets up]
GRANDMA: [stopping her] You're grandmother will be back any second. Just have a sandwich.
LORELAI: Have a sandwich? That's what you have to say to me? Have a sandwich.
GRANDMA: Well what do you want me to say?
LORELAI: I want you to say that you are sorry you tried to talk me out of taking this money. That you realize that you're just being petty and controlling and mean and that you know there's no amount of money that can change the relationship Rory and I have. That's what I want you to say - say that.
GRANDMA: I will not.
LORELAI: Well say it Mom, or I'm finding a payphone.
TRIX: Lorelai - you're here.
LORELAI: Hi Gran.
TRIX: So have you ordered the tea yet?
GRANDMA: No not yet.
TRIX: Well good because I'm afraid I'm going to have to take my leave of you a little earlier than I had anticipated.
LORELAI: What, why?
TRIX: My train leaves tonight and I have a little last minute packing to do.
GRANDMA: Well I can help you with the packing.
TRIX: Plus I really don't wish to witness anymore of this ugly little fight you two seem to be having. Raising your voice during high tea, who ever heard of such a thing. It's like Fergi all over again.
LORELAI: Oh Gran please, I'm so sorry. We're done. Please don't leave.
TRIX: I can see now that offering that trust fund was a bad idea. After all, taking into account the maturity level of those involved, this large amount of money would probably not be safe.
LORELAI: No Gran, that isn't true. Rory is an incredibly mature kid.
TRIX: Oh I'm sure she is. It's you I'm worried about.
LORELAI: But -
TRIX:. [to Emily] And I'm sure she gets it from you.
GRANDMA: But -
TRIX: Tell Rory goodbye for me. You two are welcome to visit me in London anytime. Emily, please get my coat. I will meet you outside. [leaves]
LORELAI: Well you won.
GRANDMA: I did not win.
LORELAI: You didn't want me to take the money and I'm not taking the money. That's called winning.
GRANDMA: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: No you're not.
GRANDMA: Well...yes I am.
LORELAI: Forget it Mom, it's not big deal.
GRANDMA: No it is a big deal. Here Rory had this wonderful opportunity and we - and I...maybe I can talk to her.
LORELAI: Oh yes that'll work.
GRANDMA: Well I'll go to your father.
LORELAI: Mom...
GRANDMA: He can talk to her. He can fix it. I'll make him fix it. [takes out cell and dials] Ugh damn reception. Well I'll go to a payphone.
LORELAI: Mom, Mom, stay here.
GRANDMA: Yes but Chilton.
LORELAI: Rory can still go to Chilton unless you're rethinking our agreement.
GRANDMA: No, not at all. I'm not rethinking anything.
LORELAI: Ok then we're good.
GRANDMA: Are you sure?
LORELAI: We're good.
GRANDMA: Well I'd better get out there before she leaves me here.
LORELAI: I'm sure you'll be sorry to see her go.
GRANDMA: Oh yes, I don't know what I'll do with my self. We'll see you Friday?
LORELAI: See you Friday. [Emily turns to leave] Hey Mom?
GRANDMA: Yes? [turning back]
LORELAI: Can I ask you a favor.
GRANDMA: Anything, anything at all.
LORELAI: Don't make us take the coat rack back.
GRANDMA: Deal.
CUT TO BUS STOP
[Lorelai waiting, coffee in hand, as Rory gets off the bus.]
LORELAI: Hi.
RORY: Hey.
LORELAI: Here [giving her a coffee]
RORY: Thanks. I thought you were gonna have tea today.
LORELAI: Uh, we did, we finished.
RORY: Finished early.
LORELAI: Yeah well once you're done with those little sandwiches, there's not reason to pretend you like tea anymore.
RORY: Oh I totally understand. Listen there's something I have to tell you.
LORELAI: What?
RORY: I loaned Paris your black mini and there's a good chance you may never see it again.
LORELAI: Oh well there's something I have to tell you.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You lost out on $250,000 dollars today.
RORY: What?!
[Lorelai nods as they walk down the street.]

OPEN AT ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(It's the weekly Friday dinner. Lorelai, Rory and Emily are sitting at the dinner table eating.)
RORY: Grandma, can I have some baby pictures of you and Grandpa?
EMILY: Any particular reason?
RORY: Yeah, we're doing this visual family history project for school.
EMILY: Oh. Well, if it's for school I suppose I could dig something up.
RORY: And I need some of Mom too.
LORELAI: I thought we already had this conversation.
RORY: Yeah, but I don't believe you.
LORELAI: Mother tell her.
EMILY: I don't have any baby pictures of your mother.
LORELAI: Thank you.
RORY: How could you not have any baby pictures of Mom?
EMILY: Because when your mother was seven, I came downstairs and found her burning all of her baby pictures.
R: Why would you do that? I'm sure you were a cute baby.
EMILY: She was. She was very cute.
L: Four, three, two, one.
EMILY: In most respects.
L: Then we have lift off.
R: What does that mean?
L: Nothing.
EMILY: I don't see what the problem is. You certainly grew into it.
R: Grown into what?
EMILY: As a child, your mother had an unusually large head.
L: The best thing about it was that she would tell me constantly. My first complete sentence was, "Big head want dolly."
R: I can't imagine it being that bad.
EMILY: It wasn't. It just affected her balance a little so. . .
L: Okay, can we please talk about something besides my formerly huge head?
R: Are these new chairs Grandma?
EMILY: Why, yes Rory, they are.
LORELAI: They are?
EMILY: I got them from a dealer up in Maine last summer. He just finished restoring them.
LORELAI: They look exactly like the old ones.
RORY: They're nice.
LORELAI: Are you sure they're new?
EMILY: Of course I'm sure. I bought them.
LORELAI: I don't see any difference at all.
EMILY: Well, the arch in the back is higher and they have a completely different leg.
L: Hmm, no difference.
EMILY: Of course I could only get ten of these, so I'm two chairs short of a set.
L: You're telling me.
EMILY: Lorelai, do you realize how rare these chairs are?
L: No.
EMILY: I've searched for three years or them. I've combed every fine antique store on the East Coast and this is all I could find. I blame Peg Mosley.
L: Hm, Peg Mosley. Evil, evil woman.
R: What did Peg Mosley do?
L: She lured these two German children to her gingerbread house and then she tried to eat them. Pass the artichokes please.
EMILY: I made the mistake of telling Peg all my favorite special spots and that woman moved in and completely wiped them out. You can't find a decent Biedermayer hutch in all of Connecticut. I'm desperate for new sources.
R: What about Kim's Antiques?
EMILY: What's Kim's Antiques?
L: Didn't that burn down?
R: My best friend Lane, her parents have this great antiques store in Stars Hollow.
EMILY: Is that so? (To Lorelai) Why haven't you ever told me about it?
L: Oh, I don't know Mom. I guess it just got lost in my big head.
R: Maybe you should come to Stars Hollow and I'll take you there. Like Saturday. You can come see the town.
EMILY: Well, won't you have to study?
R: I can put off studying for one day.
L: I'm working.
EMILY: No one is asking you to do anything Lorelai. This is between Rory and me. I accept your offer Rory. I would love to spend Saturday with you.
R: Great.
L: Well, I'm just sorry that I'm gonna miss it.
EMILY: Eat your artichoke Lorelai.
(Opening credits)
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
(Rory and Lorelai are sitting at a table. Luke brings their plates to them.)
LUKE: Okay, French toast with bacon crispy. Pancakes, two eggs over easy.
L: Oh.
LUKE: What?
L: You put the eggs on top of the pancakes.
R: Oops.
LUKE: What?
L: Yeah, well, it's like two eyes staring at me. See, I can't eat it like this.
R: Hence the oops.
LUKE: What are you talking about? You always order the same thing.
L: Yeah, but you usually put the eggs on the side so that my breakfast is not ogling me.
LUKE: It's the same food.
L: Hmm, yeah, I need the eggs put on the side.
LUKE: You want a brand new plate.
L: Yes.
LUKE: How about if I take this plate in the back, I take the eggs off the pancakes, I put the same eggs on the side and bring the plate back out. What happens then?
L: Then I can eat my breakfast.
LUKE: It's the same food just a different configuration.
L: I won't know that.
LUKE: I'm gonna take the plate in the back.
(Luke picks up the plate and walks away.)
L: So what time does the judgmental express arrive?
R: Grandma gets here at noon.
L: Hmm.
R: Are you sure you won't do lunch?
L: Oh no, I can't, lunch is bad.
(Rachel walks over to the table.)
RACHEL: Lorelai, you're here. Good. Don't move.
L: I won't.
(Rachel walks away)
R: What are you doing at lunch?
L: Oh, I have very important things to do.
R: Like what?
L: Well, at noon I have to not have lunch with my mother.
R: Very nice.
(Rachel walks back with a pile of photographs.)
RACHEL: So I'm developing my pictures from the Firelight Festival. Some amazing stuff. And I'm thinking maybe there's a book here, faces of small town America. . .
L: Ah, you should feel safe, you don't live near these people.
RACHEL: Exactly. And the very last sh*t on my roll was this.
(Rachel hands Lorelai a picture of Luke and Lorelai sitting on a bench.)
L: Wow. When did you take this?
RACHEL: When you weren't looking.
(Luke walks over with Lorelai's plate.)
LUKE: What's that?
L: Oh, it's a picture of us.
LUKE: Us?
RORY: Rachel took it.
RACHEL: At the Firelight Festival.
LUKE: Oh, sure, yeah. (hands Lorelai the plate.) So, uh, here's your plate, no eyes.
L: Thank you.
RACHEL: Do you wear contacts?
L: Me? No.
RACHEL: God, you've got amazing eyes. Doesn't she?
LUKE: Oh, yeah. Sure, I guess. . . I mean, they're, you know, placed good. . . . symmetrical. I'm gonna get some more coffee.
RACHEL: Yeah.
(Rory hands Lorelai a photo of an old building.)
R: Oh wow. Mom, look at this.
L: What is that?
RACHEL: It's an old abandoned inn I ran across when I was exploring the other day.
L: This is Dragonfly. I totally forgot about this place.
RACHEL: Well, it doesn't look like it's been operational in years.
R: Look at all the trees. It's pretty. Oh, I'm buzzing. (takes her pager out of her pocket)
L: What have I said about buzzing in public?
R: It's Lane. 911. That's trig. Gotta go.
L: Bye. Take a . . . yeah.
R: Bye Rachel.
RACHEL: Bye. (Rory leaves.) See, that is one really not annoying kid.
L: Yes, she really is not.
RACHEL: See, I might consider doing the whole mom thing if I could be guaranteed that I could get one just like her.
L: Oh you can, you just have to go to Sears. God, where is this again?
RACHEL: Uh, it's kind of behind the mill. You go over the little footbridge with the mean duck family living under it.
L: Yes, the Armbrusters. Wow, it's really amazing.
RACHEL: Do you want to see it?
L: What?
RACHEL: The inn. I'm gonna head out that way in a little while.
L: Oh, well. . .
RACHEL: Come on, finish your breakfast. I'll drive us out there.
(Luke walks to the table carrying a coffee pot.)
LUKE: Drive her out where?
RACHEL: Oh, Lorelai and I are going to cruise the docks.
L: Yeah, we're gonna see how many sailors we can get to tattoo our names on their butts.
RACHEL: So what do you think?
L: Well, I have to check in at the inn first.
RACHEL: Well that's okay. Good. I'll pick you up there.
L: Okay. Good.
(Rachel walks away.)
LUKE: So what was all about?
L: Oh nothing. We're just gonna go check out this old inn Rachel found.
LUKE: Hmm.
L: What?
LUKE: Nothing. I didn't know you guys were friends.
L: Hm, well we're not really friends. I mean, I don't know her that well. But we're just hanging out. She seems really great.
LUKE: Oh yeah, she is. She's great. She's just, you know, a lot different from you.
L: 'Cause I'm not really great?
LUKE: No, you're great. Just in a different way.
L: In a not really great way?
LUKE: That's not what I meant. The two of you are just completely different people. Both great, but I'm just a little surprised that, you know, you're different types of greatness are, you know, melding and you're comfortably great together.
L: Is this bothering you?
LUKE: This conversation, yes.
L: No. Um, the idea of Rachel and I hanging out together. Is there some reason that's weird for you or something?
LUKE: Why would it be?
L: No reason I can think of.
LUKE: Okay, well then it's not weird.
L: Good, well I was just checking.
LUKE: Okay, well then, you checked.
L: Okay. So are you gonna be pouring that coffee anytime or. . .
LUKE: Oh.
L: I'm glad it's not weird though because . . (Luke overflows her coffee cup.) . . . that would be bad.
LUKE: Oh, I'll get a rag.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
(Lorelai is talking to a group from Japan, while a translator repeats everything she says in Japanese.)
LORELAI: Welcome Ichiro Motors to the Independence Inn. So the dining room is right through there. And breakfast is served 6 to 11:30, although our chef is an amazing overachiever and she'll be happy to prepare you anything you want any time of day. Now your itinerary for the conference will be in each of your rooms. And if you have any questions at all, just please feel free to ask, uh . . . (gestures toward Michel at the counter.)
MICHEL: No. (Michel walks away)
LORELAI: . . . . somebody else. Not him. Okay, so ask Roger. Roger will be happy to help you. Thanks so much.
(Lorelai walks away from the group. She sees Rune sitting on a couch in the lobby. She walks past him hiding her face.)
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
(Sookie is mixing something. Lorelai walks in.)
L: Rune is in the lobby.
SOOKIE: Lorelai, hello. I made some coffee.
L: Rune is in the lobby.
SOOKIE: Oh, I also made those little orange glazed muffins you like with warm cinnamon butter.
L: Sookie, Rune is in the lobby.
SOOKIE: Uh huh.
L: Why?
SOOKIE: Your muffin's getting cold.
L: My muffin's fine. My muffin wants to know what the fruitcake is doing in the lobby.
SOOKIE: Well, he's staying with Jackson.
L: Again?
SOOKIE: Still.
L: I thought he was only here for a weekend.
SOOKIE: Yes, the lost weekend.
L: Okay. Explain Yoko, because he's out there with the normal people and he's going to scare them
SOOKIE: He won't leave.
L: Jackson's house?
SOOKIE: Yes. Jackson's house. He won't leave and it's driving me crazy.
L: Well tell Jackson to kick him out.
SOOKIE: Jackson won't do it.
L: Why not?
SOOKIE: Because he says it's family and somehow he feels responsible for him.
L: Well, okay yes, but has Jackson met him? I think that would change his mind.
SOOKIE: Apparently, Rune had a rough childhood. His parents don't talk to him, his brothers and sisters don't talk to him, no one talks to him.
L: So, then what's wrong with Jackson?
SOOKIE: I don't know. But he's determined to stand by him and I have to respect his decision.
L: Well, that part I can understand.
SOOKIE: Good.
L: But the part I can't understand is what is Rune doing in the lobby?
SOOKIE: Yeah, well, I don't . . .
(Jackson walks through the door carry a crate of berries and a jar of jam.)
JACKSON: Lorelai.
L: Jackson.
JACKSON: These are for you.
L: For me?
(Sookie stands behind Lorelai and starts waving a spoon back and forth to get Jackson's attention. Jackson doesn't notice.)
JACKSON: Yeah and I also brought some of my raspberry peach jam. I think you're gonna like it. Put it on ice cream.
L: Okay.
JACKSON: Or take a graham cracker, spread a little on it, break up a chocolate bar, throw it in the broiler for a couple of minutes, and you're gonna be singing show tunes all evening.
L: Must be some good jam.
JACKSON: Yeah, well, it's just my way of saying thanks for helping out Rune.
L: Thanks for helping out Rune.
SOOKIE: Okay, I'm doing the spoon signal.
JACKSON: Oh, I didn't notice.
SOOKIE: Okay, I'm waving around like an idiot here.
JACKSON: So you haven't. . .
SOOKIE: No.
JACKSON: Ah.
SOOKIE: Yeah.
JACKSON: So I should . . .
SOOKIE: Good idea.
JACKSON: Right. Um, enjoy the jam. (Jackson leaves)
L: Well, uh, would you mind explaining the thank you jam.
SOOKIE: Well, I was supposed to ask you something about Rune.
L: Like what?
SOOKIE: Well, he just not too long ago lost his job.
L: Oh, attitude problem?
SOOKIE: Something like that.
L: Uh huh.
(Lorelai starts eating the jar of jam with a spoon.)
SOOKIE: Anyway, when he lost his job, he couldn't pay his rent so then he got evicted. None of this was known to us when he came to stay with Jackson. I mean, but this is the situation. So I was thinking that if he could get another job and then he could save up some money and afford his own place and move out, and then I wouldn't end up stabbing him in the neck with a grapefruit spoon.
L: Ouch.
SOOKIE: Its gonna happen.
L: You want me to give him a job?
SOOKIE: Nothing important.
L: Oh good, 'cause I was gonna put him in charge of legal.
SOOKIE: I know it's a lot to ask, but I can't think of anything else.
L: What can he do?
SOOKIE: Lots of things! He's always fiddling around, using screws. Once I saw him use a hammer.
L: A hammer?
SOOKIE: I bet he could be a handyman. You are always looking for a good handyman.
L: Well I couldn't pay him very much.
SOOKIE: Well, that's okay. Maybe he could just work for, uh, room and board.
L: You want him to live here?
SOOKIE: No! Well, what about the old potting shed?
L: The old potting shed? That's where Rory and I lived when she was a baby. It has memories and little rosebud wallpaper. I don't want Boo Radley touching my rosebud wallpaper.
SOOKIE: The job is enough. You're right. He can save up money and eventually move out. I'll just have to deal with it.
L: The potting shed's fine.
SOOKIE: Really?
L: Yes.
SOOKIE: I love you!
L: But I swear to God Sookie, the minute the guests start complaining or disappearing, he's out of there.
SOOKIE: More than fair.
L: Mm, it's really good jam.
(Lorelai hands Sookie the jar of jam.)
SOOKIE: Yeah. It is isn't it?
(Lorelai leaves)
CUT TO OUTSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Rory is sitting on the porch. Emily pulls up the driveway. Rory walks to her car.)
R: Grandma.
EMILY: Rory, hello. What a lovely day to. . . ugh. (Emily's heel gets caught in the grass.) I guess putting in a walkway never occurred to your mother.
R: Oh actually it occurs to her every day on the way to work. Here. (Rory helps pull her heel out of the grass.)
EMILY: Thank you.
(They start walking towards the house.)
CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Rory and Emily walk in through the front door.)
R: Are your shoes okay?
EMILY: They're fine. Just a little muddy that's all.
R: Here give 'em. I'll clean them for you.
EMILY: Oh you don't have to do that.
(Rory takes the shoes and walks into the kitchen. Emily follows.)
R: My mom found this great shoe cleaner. It's gets out pretty much anything. Do you want something to drink, there should be some iced tea in the fridge.
EMILY: Iced tea would be nice. (opens fridge) Oh my god. There's nothing in here.
(Rory pours some cleaner on a cloth and starts wiping off Emily's shoes.)
R: I know, it's a little sparse.
EMILY: It's the Grapes of Wrath.
R: Don't worry. We eat fine.
EMILY: No food, no drink. Do you at least have plates?
R: Yes, we have plates.
(Emily pulls a plate out the cabinet.)
EMILY: There are women in bikinis on them.
R: The original Charlie's Angels. It took us years to get a complete set. You can find the Kate Jackson's and the Shelly Hack's pretty easily. Even the Cheryl Ladd's. But the Farrah Fawcett's and the Jacklyn Smith's are a little harder to come by, but still accessible. The real trick however is to find the Tanya Roberts. We have three.
EMILY: You have three Tanya Roberts?
R: Yup.
EMILY: And I was worried, silly me. (She puts the plate away) How are you doing with those shoes?
R: All done. (hands Emily the shoes)
EMILY: That's amazing. What is that you used?
R: I don't know. We got if off one of those late night TV ads. Apparently it also gets rust off nails and hinges, waxes your car perfectly, and weatherproofs windows and doors.
EMILY: Well, isn't that nice?
R: Okay, about today. I think I should just give you the grand tour of the town. So we can start by walking to Kim's Antiques, which takes us by all the good sites.
EMILY: Well, uh, Rory, I don't think I wore the right shoes for the grand tour. Why don't we just drive?
R: You can borrow some of my mom's shoes.
EMILY: Uh, no, I don't think so. Rory hold on a minute.
R: Grandma, you will be missing the true Stars Hollow experience if you don't walk. Trust me.
(Rory starts walking upstairs)
EMILY: All right, but I won't wear anything with rhinestones or zebra stripes or anything that has batteries or that sings or make animal noises or moves on its own.
R: Grandma, I got it.
CUT TO DRAGONFLY
(Lorelai and Rachel are standing in front of an old, rundown building.)
LORELAI: Must have been something when it was all fixed up and nice.
RACHEL: Can I ask what the fascination with this place is?
L: Oh, well, me and my friend Sookie, we've been kind of toying with the idea of opening our own place together.
RACHEL: Really?
L: Yeah. I mean someday, obviously not now. We're still saving up.
RACHEL: Are you close?
L: No, not at all.
RACHEL: Well, this looks like this could be a great place.
L: Yeah it really does. God. A little paint, some pretty curtains, 150 thousand dollars of construction. We're open for business.
RACHEL: Did you always want to own an inn?
L: Uh no, I was still dreaming of owning a red Camaro when Rory appeared on the scene.
RACHEL: Ah. Right
L: It's a new idea in the last couple years actually. How about you? Did you always want to be a photographer?
RACHEL: Not specifically. I just remember growing up thinking I want to be anywhere but here.
L: Ah, that was you in the other room.
RACHEL: I made sure to pick something that would keep me moving, constantly.
L: Sounds exciting.
RACHEL: It is. Tiring too. And now that I'm here, back with Luke, I don't know.
L: Things seem to be going pretty well for you guys.
RACHEL: I guess. But I tell you, these last couple weeks, it's become increasingly apparent to me that things just can't continue the way they've been.
L: What do you mean?
RACHEL: I mean, I think it's time we get serious. I'm ready to settle down, I guess, is the creepy old fashion term for it. Pretty damn scary, huh?
L: Pretty damn scary.
CUT TO SIDEWALK
(Emily and Rory are walking through Stars Hollow.)
EMILY: I feel ridiculous.
R: You look great.
EMILY: I feel like a Clydesdale.
R: You look like you're comfortable.
EMILY: People are staring.
R: Because you look great.
EMILY: Yes, what a shame your grandfather isn't here. He'd fall in love with me all over again.
CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES
(Emily and Rory walk in through the front door.)
EMILY: I think we came in through the storeroom.
R: Nope, this is it.
EMILY: This is the antique store?
R: You have to dig but you can find some great stuff here.
EMILY: This is ridiculous. No one can run a quality business like this. This place is dusty and disorganized and you can't possibly. . . . Oh now that is gorgeous. Look at the woodwork. It's exquisite. I wonder if it has mate.
R: Grandma, look at this. It's got like little flowers all over it.
EMILY: It's very pretty.
R: Is it something special?
EMILY: Do you like it?
R: Yeah.
EMILY: Then it's something special.
(Lane walks over.)
LANE: Hi.
R: Lane, this is my grandma. Grandma, this is my friend Lane.
EMILY: Well, I've heard a lot about you.
LANE: It's nice to meet you. Uh, Rory can I talk to you for a sec?
EMILY: Go, talk. I have a lot of looking to do here.
(Rory and Lane walk to the kitchen.)
LANE: Problem.
R: Hit me.
LANE: It's been a week since that party, and still he has not called.
R: Henry.
LANE: He said he'd call.
R: Maybe he's been busy.
LANE: Maybe he has a girlfriend.
R: Lane.
LANE: A tiny perfect Korean girl that his parents would love and approve of.
R: Lane, you are a tiny perfect Korean girl that his parents would love and approve of.
LANE: No, they'd know.
R: Know what?
LANE: Know that I listen to the wrong music and wish I could go blond without looking like an idiot. Or that I'd take a whopper over kimchi in a b*at.
R: Now you're just going crazy.
LANE: So he doesn't like me, he's not gonna call. It's not the end of the world. I'll live. I'll go one. There's always college. Unless my parents get their way, and then it's 'I take thee Jesus to be my lawful wedded husband.'
R: Lane, with all due respect to your fiancé, Henry will call.
LANE: No he's not.
R: Well then why did he talk to you all night. .
LANE: Well. .
R: . . and follow you around everywhere you went. .
LANE: 'cause . . .
R: . .and ask you to dance six times?
LANE: Was it six times?
R: It was six times. And he did not ask you to dance six times because you're a good dancer, because to tell you the truth and as much as I love you, you're not.
LANE: Really?
R: You are an embarrassment to the art of dancing.
LANE: Thank you.
MRS. KIM (in background): That's mid nineteenth century, four different kinds of wood.
(Cut to Mrs. Kim and Emily bartering over a cabinet. Lane and Rory watch them from the kitchen.)
EMILY: Is it missing an inlay?
MRS. KIM: No.
EMILY: I thought it was missing an inlay.
MRS. KIM: Perfect condition!
EMILY: How much?
MRS. KIM: Thirty-five hundred for the pair.
EMILY: You must be joking!
MRS. KIM: No. No joke.
EMILY: Well, they're nice, but they're certainly not that nice.
MRS. KIM: Not a better pair on the East Coast.
EMILY: Two thousand.
MRS. KIM: You're from Hartford.
EMILY: Yes.
MRS. KIM: Ah.
EMILY: It hardly matters where I'm from. I know these pieces are overpriced.
MRS. KIM: Look on the bottom.
EMILY: They're not signed.
MRS. KIM: Look on the bottom.
EMILY: Are they signed?
MRS. KIM: Look on the bottom!
(Emily leans down and looks.)
MRS. KIM: They're signed.
EMILY: How do I know that's authentic?
MRS. KIM: You have my word.
EMILY: And a letter of authentication?
MRS. KIM: That too.
LANE (to Rory): It's like watching the Williams' sisters.
R: I wish we had popcorn.
MRS. KIM: . . .Insulting!
EMILY: I won't take it.
MRS. KIM: Then someone else will!
EMILY: Eventually, maybe.
MRS. KIM: I can wait.
EMILY: So can I.
MRS. KIM: That's my last offer.
EMILY: I'll think about it.
MRS. KIM: I'll waive the tax.
EMILY: And throw in delivery.
MRS. KIM: We appreciate your business.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
(Emily and Rory walk out of Kim's Antiques)
EMILY: I like that woman. And you know what? I like these shoes.
R: You're becoming one of us Grandma.
EMILY: This way?
R: Yeah.
EMILY: I love this street.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN
(Michel walks through the lobby as Rune walks through the front door carrying a duffel bag.)
RUNE: Hey.
MICHEL: May I help you?
RUNE: Yeah, I need to know where my room is.
MICHEL: Uh, are you sure you are in the right place? Perhaps you want the YMCA or the local bus station.
RUNE: You speak English?
MICHEL: Do you have a reservation?
RUNE: I work here.
MICHEL: Hm, I do not think so. You see, we have standards, and even if they were much much lower, you would still be poor boy out of luck.
RUNE: I'm the new handyman. Lorelai hired me
MICHEL: Oh, you know Lorelai?
RUNE: I dated her.
MICHEL: Oh you did?
RUNE: Yeah, but hey, don't spread it around, it's not one of my shining moments.
MICHEL: Yeah, and you probably have so many to pick from.
RUNE: You're rude.
MICHEL: You've caught me to the quick, out of here teeny tiny man.
RUNE: Look I will only be pushed so far.
MICHEL: And obviously it's down.
(Lorelai runs over to them.)
LORELAI: Rune, you made it, great.
RUNE: Finally. Will you tell this guy who I am?
L: This is Rune.
MICHEL: You know him?
L: He's gonna be our new handyman.
RUNE: See! Handyman.
MICHEL: Be quiet.
RUNE: Go build us another statue.
MICHEL: You hired this man?
L: Yes.
MICHEL: Did you date him also?
L: What! No, I didn't date him. Rune, I didn't date you. It was one night. .
MICHEL: One night, you and him together?
L: I'll explain later.
MICHEL: Oh, I cannot wait.
L: Yeah. Listen, Rune, here, come with me, I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
RUNE: Can you ask your bellboy here to grab my stuff? I think I might've sprained my shoulder on the way over here.
L: Relax. I got it. (picks up the duffel bag) Uh. Geez. Move it Rune.
(Lorelai and Rune leave. Emily and Rory walk through the front door.)
RORY: So, what do you think?
EMILY: Well, I think it's very nice.
RORY: Mom's office is right back there. Oh and you have to see the dining room. They got the chandeliers from one of Martha Washington's houses.
EMILY: Do you spend a lot of time here?
RORY: Yeah. I work here a couple afternoons a week, and I help out with special occasions. They have a lot of weddings here. I wonder where mom is.
EMILY: Oh, don't bother your mother. I'm sure she's busy.
R: Oh no, she'd want to say hi.
(Rory and Emily walk over to Michel, who is behind the front desk.)
R: Michel, where's Mom?
MICHEL: Off with her boyfriend.
R: What boyfriend?
MICHEL: Small, dark, wanted in four states.
R: Okay, well, do you know when she's coming back because my grandmother's here and we want to say hi.
MICHEL: Your grandmother?
EMILY: Emily Gilmore.
MICHEL: Michel Gerard.
(They shake hands.)
EMILY: Enchantée. D'où venez vous?
MICHEL: Paris.
EMILY: J'adore Paris. Nous y allons chaque printemps.
MICHEL: Oh, oui, le printemps à Paris...
EMILY: Un cliché, mais pourtant...
MICHEL: C'est si vrai, c'est si vrai...
RORY: Okay, well, we better go find mom.
EMILY: It's been a pleasure meeting you.
MICHEL: The pleasure is all mine.
(Emily and Rory walk towards the center of the lobby.)
EMILY: What a charming man.
R: Uh okay. (sees Lorelai ahead) Mom, hi.
L: Mom, hi.
EMILY: Lorelai, it's quite a place you've got here.
L: Oh, well it's not really my place, I just work here, so. . I thought you were gonna go antiquing.
R: Yeah we did. And then we had lunch.
L: Oh, really? Where?
EMILY: Teriyaki Joe's.
L: You're kidding.
R: She picked.
L: You did?
EMILY: It looked festive.
L: I can't picture you at Teriyaki Joe's . . .or in jogging shoes. What's up working girl?
EMILY: Well, Rory decided that we should take the grand tour of the town; that meant walking. I hope you don't mind, I borrowed your socks also.
L: Oh, I don't mind. I wish I had a camera, but I don't mind.
R: I'm gonna go show her the grounds.
L: Oh yeah, good. On the way back, show her the gym. Jump on the treadmill.
R: See you later.
L: Make sure you stretch first.
(Lorelai walks over to the front desk.)
MICHEL: I just love your mother.
CUT TO OUTSIDE
(Rory and Emily are walking along the pond on the inn's grounds.)
RORY: So the horses are up on that hill, and the tennis courts are over there.
EMILY: It's certainly impressive.
(They walk towards the potting shed.)
RORY: And this is my favorite place.
EMILY: The tool shed?
RORY: No, this is where we used to live.
EMILY: What?
R: Right when mom and I moved here, this was our apartment.
EMILY: But. .
(Rory opens the door and walks in. Emily looks in from the doorway.)
R: I know it's looks small, but it's really pretty. Come on. See we had our bed right over there, and mom put up this really pretty curtain around the tub so that it looked like a real bathroom. And we would just sit outside at night when the Inn would have parties and we'd just listen to music and feed the ducks and. . . (Emily walks away) Grandma? Grandma wait, what's the matter?
EMILY: Nothing.
R: Did something happen? Are you sick? Is it the teriyaki?
EMILY: I'm fine. Its just getting late, I have to go.
R: But. . .
(Rory watches as Emily walks away. Rune walks towards the shed carrying some sheets.)
RUNE: Hey. Do you mind?
R: What? Oh sorry. (She moves out of the way so that Rune can go into the shed.)



CUT TO HALLWAY
(Lorelai walks down a hallway and knocks on a door that says "Williams Hardware, Office, Private". Rachel answers the door.)
RACHEL: Hey! Good, you got my message.
LORELAI: Hail the glory of the answering machine.
RACHEL: Come on in. (Lorelai walks inside) I just developed some shots of the Dragonfly I think you're gonna love. Maybe they can help inspire you a little more.
L: Oh, great! Hm, I've never been in Luke's apartment before.
RACHEL: Really? How long have you two known each other?
L: Oh god, years. But our relationship is strictly "Please can I have coffee?", 'No,', 'Come on!, 'No, it makes you short.' Blah blah blah.
RACHEL: Well, then let me give you the grand tour. This, is it.
L: It's, uh, not how I pictured it. I mean, not that I've been picturing Luke's apartment. I haven't been picturing it at all.
RACHEL: I know what you meant.
(Lorelai walks over to the window and touches the curtains.)
L: Hmm. Nice touch.
RACHEL: Oh, those aren't mine.
L: You're kidding.
RACHEL: Nope. Frankly, a little too frilly for my taste.
L: I'm gonna give him so much crap about that.
RACHEL: Have a seat.
L: Thanks. (sits down on the couch) Man, you guys are living in pretty tight quarters here.
RACHEL: Well this was originally his dad's office, so it was never really meant for anyone to actually live in.
L: But tell that to Luke.
RACHEL: Exactly.
L: Do you think about moving to a bigger place?
RACHEL: I don't think so.
L: No? Oh right. Because tight quarters, romantic. Hello Lorelai.
RACHEL: Yeah, well I don't think romance has a lot to do with it.
L: No?
RACHEL: I'm not sure I'm gonna be in Stars Hollow much longer.
L: Oh. But I thought. . .
RACHEL: I know, I just, I can't seem to make Luke believe that I really want to stay this time.
L: Did you tell him all that stuff you told me?
RACHEL: Till I was blue in the face.
L: Well you just have to keep trying until he hears you.
(Rachel sits down next to Lorelai on the couch.)
RACHEL: Hey, I don't blame him. I've given him no reason to believe me. I just hope that magically somehow he'd, I don't know, forget that I'd skipped out on him a million times before.
L: Have you told him that you're thinking of leaving?
RACHEL: Nope.
L: Are you going to?
RACHEL: I don't know. I mean, I feel like I've been trying so hard to make everything good. But this town, you know, it's like living under a microscope. Everyone here is just waiting for you to screw up.
L: No that's not true.
RACHEL: Miss Patty?
L: Oh, well yeah.
RACHEL: I don't know how long I can stick around here waiting for Luke when I feel like I don't have a friend in the world.
L: Hey, if you can French braid hair, I'll be your friend.
RACHEL: Sorry.
L: Oh, well, see ya.
RACHEL: I cannot find your pictures here. They must be in the bathroom.
L: So do not wanna know why.
(Rachel starts walking towards the bathroom, then stops and turns around.)
RACHEL: Hey, I know this is not so not cool to ask. But if the situation comes up and it's not too weird, a little word of encouragement from you might help a lot.
L: Oh, yeah, sure. If it comes up.
RACHEL: Thanks
(Rachel goes into the bathroom. Luke walks in the front door.)
L: What, you don't knock?
LUKE: What are you doing here?
L: Rachel invited me.
LUKE: Oh.
L: To look at some pictures.
LUKE: Good.
L: Yeah. And go through your underwear drawer.
LUKE: Where is she?
L: Freezing your bra.
LUKE: Where?
L: In the bathroom.
LUKE: Right.
L: It's a nice place you have here.
LUKE: Thank you.
L: I like the curtains.
LUKE: Yeah, yeah, Rachel picked them out.
L: Oh, she's got good taste.
(Rachel comes out of the bathroom)
RACHEL: Oh. Hey.
LUKE: Hi. I just had to put something in the safe.
RACHEL: We were just. . .
L: I told him about the underwear drawer.
RACHEL: And the baseball cap fashion show?
LUKE: Okay. I'm gonna go now.
(Luke leaves.)
L: I think he's going to buy a matching rug.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Lane and Rory are lying on Rory's bed)
RORY: I like this song. It makes me gloomy.
LANE: Gloom is good.
R: Really gloomy.
LANE: Like Joy Division Gloomy? Nick Cave gloomy? Robert Smith gloomy?
R: Johnny Cash gloomy.
LANE: So kind of like a San Quentin-y, it's a long road home and my horse just got sh*t but I've still got my girl by my side gloomy?
R: You read my mind.
LANE: I'm deep in a Charlie Parker gloomy.
R: Henry still hasn't called?
LANE: Oh no, he called.
R: He did? Why didn't you tell me?
LANE: Well I didn't talk to him. He left a message. I listened to it eight-and-a-half times, but then my mom came home and I had to erase it. But I was so panicked that I broke it, which is better because now all evidence that a boy called me is in the trash.
R: Eight and a half times.
LANE: Well it was a good message the first couple times. Then I started parsing it for subtext.
R: What did he say?
LANE: He said, and I quote, "Hey Lane, it's Henry." Not a good start.
R: How do you figure?
LANE: It's so gender neutral. It's how you start a conversation with a bowling pal.
R: He asked you bowling?
LANE: Then he said "It was fun meeting you the other night."
R: What?
LANE: He didn't say which night. Like he didn't remember which night. Like he's mixing me up with another girl from another night. For all I know, he thought he was calling the hot blonde he met at a hopped up night at Balthazar's.
R: He's a 16 year old Korean boy.
LANE: Or so he led me to believe.
R: What's the bottom line here?
LANE: Okay, the bottom line is that he wants me to call him back. But if I do that then he's probably gonna ask me out on a date. And if we go out on a date then it could lead to another date, and then I'll have to introduce him to my parents. And once I do that, they're gonna like him. Because he's Korean and he's gonna be a doctor. And then once that happens, that's it. It'll be over. He'll be hideous to me. Now I'm a Lou Reed gloomy.
(phone rings. Rory answers it.)
R: Hello?
EMILY: Rory, hello. Do you have a minute?
R: Uh, sure.
EMILY: Now I know this will probably seem silly but I was wondering what your favorite color is.
R: Oh, I don't really have one. Blue I guess.
EMILY: Okay. What about flowers? Do you like flowers?
R: Sure.
EMILY: Which would you say you like better, roses or lilies?
R: Hmm, sunflowers.
EMILY: Sunflowers it is. Now, what about music? N'sync or 98 degrees?
R (to Lane): Uh, N'sync or 98 degrees?
LANE: What kind of sick joke is this?
R: I don't think I could choose.
EMILY: What about that other group? The Backside Boys?
R: You mean the Backstreet Boys?
EMILY: Yes that's it.
R: Um, I guess if I really had to choose, I'd say N'sync.
EMILY: Wonderful.
R: Are you writing this down?
EMILY: Maybe.
R: What for?
EMILY: You'll see. I'm looking forward to dinner on Friday.
R: Okay, yeah, me too.
(hangs up)
R: What was that?
LANE: Sounded like some sick take on the Gallup survey. I gotta go
R: Call him.
LANE: I already left him a message, he's probably parsing it right now.
R: I'm sure.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
(Luke is behind the counter. Lorelai comes down the back steps and walks behind the counter.)
LUKE: Hey.
L: Hey.
LUKE: Want some coffee?
L: Oh, yeah coffee would be great.
(Luke fills up a carryout cup and hands it to her.)
L: Thanks.
LUKE: Watch the lid there.
L: Yeah. Wow, it really looks, um, different from back here, ya know? All this is yours, as far as the eye can see.
LUKE: Yes, it's quite an empire I've built for myself. I'm thinking of conquering the flower shop next door and expanding the freezer.
L: Hey, I didn't mean to kick you out of your own apartment.
LUKE: Oh, you didn't.
L: Well you left pretty fast.
LUKE: Yeah, you guys looks like you were talking girl talk.
L: Girl talk.
LUKE: Yeah.
L: What's girl talk?
LUKE: You know, pantyhose, nail polish.
L: Curtains.
LUKE: Yes. That stuff.
L: You didn't like me being up there?
LUKE: No big deal.
(Luke walks away. Lorelai follows him.)
CUT TO STORAGE ROOM
(Luke is in the storage room unloading boxes. Lorelai walks in.)
L: So, this is the fascinating storage area where fascinating acts of storage take place.
LUKE: Yup, this is it.
L: Some good looking pickles.
LUKE: What are you doing?
L: I'm admiring your pickles.
LUKE: You shouldn't be in here.
L: Why not?
LUKE: 'Cause my insurance covers only me.
L: That's not true. You're kidding right?
LUKE: Its not safe, something might fall.
L: You don't like me hanging out with Rachel do you?
LUKE: Oh, come on.
L: Am I right?
LUKE: You can hang out with anybody you want.
L: Not my question.
LUKE: Well that's my answer.
L: Well, we're eight.
LUKE: Just a friendly piece of advice. Don't get too attached to her.
L: Rachel?
LUKE: Yeah. She's got an interesting habit of getting bored and then leaving, usually without saying goodbye.
L: People break habits.
LUKE: Not often.
L: So you're just convinced that that's what she's gonna do?
LUKE: I'll bet you that's exactly what she does.
L: Well, let's say that is what she does. Don't you think there's the teensiest possibility that if Rachel leaves Stars Hollow this time its because she thinks you don't want her to stay?
LUKE: Are you guys talking about me?
L: No . . . Yes.
LUKE: Okay, I don't mind if you hang out with her, but you will not talk about me.
L: Why? It's fun. We wear plaid, take turns not shaving.
LUKE: There will be no Luke talk period.
L: Do you wanna know what I think about this situation?
LUKE: No.
L: Are you sure?
LUKE: Look, if you're gonna tell me at least help me unload.
L: Can I use the fun cutter thingy?
LUKE: Not if you call it the fun cutter thingy.
L: Please.
LUKE: Cut the box, not your hand.
L: Good tip, you should teach. (cuts open the box) Ha! Fun!
LUKE: Talk.
L: Well, I don't know exactly what's going on in Rachel's head because I'm not a Vulcan, but from the way she talks about you and the way she smiles when your name comes up, I'm pretty sure that she's serious about staying in Stars Hollow this time.
LUKE: Yeah, let me guess. Rachel told you she wanted to put down roots, that she's serious this time, that she's tired of the road, and realizes what's lacking in her nomadic existence.
L: She didn't use the phrase nomadic existence, but basically yes, that's what she said.
LUKE: I've heard the speech. I know the speech by heart.
L: Well, I think she means it this time.
LUKE: You don't know her like I do.
L: I don't. But she seems sincere.
LUKE: How do you know?
L: Her nose didn't grow.
LUKE: Why are you taking her side?
L: I'm not taking her side.
LUKE: Well it sounds like you're taking her side.
L: Well, wash out your ears, I'm not taking her side.
LUKE: I mean you're practically pushing her on me.
L: I just want you to be happy.
LUKE: And you know what makes me happy?
L: No, I just know that you've been carrying a torch for her for a really long time.
LUKE: I have not been carrying a torch for her.
L: Well, you wanted this to happen.
LUKE: How do you know what I wanted to happen?
L: Didn't you?
LUKE: Yeah, I guess.
L: Okay. So here it is, right in front of you. Just take it. Take the plunge. She could be ready. Just jump in and believe her. Unless, you know, there's some other reason you don't want to.
LUKE: Like what?
L: Like I. . . .I don't know.
LUKE: There's no other reason.
L: Okay, well, fine. Then there's no other reason.
LUKE: I'll think about it.
L: Okay. Well, thanks for letting me borrow your thingy.
LUKE: You're welcome.
L: I'll see you later Luke.
(Lorelai leaves.)
CUT TO MOVIE THEATER
(Rory and Lorelai are sitting in the theater, waiting for the movie to start.)
L: She actually asked if you like the Backstreet Boys?
R: Except she called them Backside Boys.
L: Ha! That is high comedy. What inspired that woman?
R: I don't know. It was weird.
L: Sudden interest in pop music I sat her down to listen to a Prince song once, and she looked like she was having a stroke. Wait a minute. I know what she's doing.
R: What?
L: She's trying to be your pal now. Ah, that sneak. You spend one day together and she wants to know all about you. She's picturing you guys chatting about boys, and painting each other's toenails.
(Kirk, sitting behind them, clears his throat loudly. They turn around to look.)
L: Oh hey Kirk. You getting a cold? You know you should try that dinametichemphemital. Knocks it right out. Don't drive a forklift though, 'cause it'll make you drowsy.
(Luke and Rachel walk in holding hands. They sit down in the front row.)
R: Oh wow, when's the last time you think Luke's been to a movie?
L: I don't know but I think the guy had to crank the projector by hand.
KIRK: Do you mind?
(Lorelai turns around)
L: Kirk, the movie hasn't even started yet.
KIRK: I like to have silence in order to cleanse my mental pallet and achieve calm before enjoying a motion picture.
L: Oh you got that out of a book. (Turns around. She watches Luke and Rachel talking.) Luke looks happy, doesn't he?
R: Yeah, he looks happy.
L: And they seem really right together, don't they?
R: Just right.
L: Good, good, he deserves it. So I did the right thing by butting in the way I did.
R: You butted in for all the right reasons. You were concerned about a friend.
(The lights dim and the movie starts.)
L: So if Rachel turns out to be an evil fembot and m*rder Luke in his sleep, I'm not responsible am I?
R: Only in an intergalactic court.
L: Good. And Rachel seems really great. . .
KIRK: You are now officially disturbing not just me but every person in this theater.
L: Kirk, you're the only one who's disturbed.
(A cell phone goes off. Lorelai looks around and discovers that it's Kirk's. He tries to answer it, but the ringing won't stop.)
L: Uh! Shhh!
KIRK: Hello?
L: Shhh! Shh! God, don't you hate that?
KIRK: Hello? Dammit!
(Kirk runs out of the theater. Lorelai laughs. She sees Luke looking towards her and waves.)
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Lorelai and Rory ring the doorbell. Emily answers the door.)
EMILY: Hello, hello, hello.
L: Wow, Mom, hi. (to Rory) Uh, check the rubbing alcohol.
EMILY: How was the drive?
L: The drive was fine.
EMILY: Good.
L: The foyer looks great.
EMILY: I have a surprise for you.
L: The rest of the house ran away?
EMILY: No.
L: No.
EMILY: Rory, come with me.
(Emily pulls Rory in and leads her away.)
L: Okay, so, I'll. . . I'll follow you then. Great.
CUT TO UPSTAIRS
(Emily, Rory and Lorelai go into a bedroom, which Emily has redecorated for Rory.)
EMILY: Voila.
R: Oh my. Um Grandma what is this?
EMILY: This is your room.
R: What?
EMILY: Since you've been spending so much time here lately, I thought you should have a special place all your own.
R: But you didn't have to do this.
EMILY: Do you like it?
R: Yeah, it's beautiful.
L: (whispers to Rory) Do you see the N'Sync poster?
R: Thank you Grandma. (hugs Emily)
EMILY: You're welcome sweetheart. Now come on, lets go downstairs and see if dinner's ready. (Rory leaves.) (To Lorelai) Are you coming?
L: You bought her CosmoGirl.
EMILY: Well the young girls enjoy the articles.
L: You bought boy band posters and Hello Kitty notepads.
EMILY: A lovely young girl at the store helped me pick them out.
L: You filled the room with sunflowers.
EMILY: Rory likes sunflowers.
L: I know Rory likes sunflowers.
EMILY: What is the matter Lorelai?
L: Nothing. I don't know. It's just a little weird that's all.
EMILY: Why is it weird to do something for my granddaughter?
L: I don't know. I mean, it's not like you bought her a car. By the way, don't. It's a room and . . .you know, you're right. It's nice. I'm sorry. I'm just being silly.
EMILY: Maybe you don't like the fact that now she has a place away from you, some place that's just her own.
L: I said I was fine.
EMILY: Or maybe its because its so large and spacious and has four solid walls around the bathtub.
L: What?
EMILY: I mean, it may not be exciting or bohemian, but at least it doesn't have shovels propped up against the sofa either, now does it?
L: I'm sorry. I missed the checkered flag, when did the argument start?
EMILY: Is it because it's not a shack in the woods? Or is it the proximity to me that's making it so uncomfortable for you?
L: What are you talking about?
EMILY: You hated us that much?
L: What?
EMILY: You had to take that little girl away. That was bad enough. But to that? To live there, in a shed, like a hobo?
L: Who uses the word hobo anymore?
EMILY: I saw it. I saw that horrible little pit you so proudly ran to. I saw what you chose over your own family. You would've lived in the gutter, in the street, it a cardboard box, anywhere as long as you didn't have to be near us, isn't that true?
L: Mom. .
EMILY: Isn't that true Lorelai?
L: Mom, I was very young and I was very unhappy and I needed to be some place that wasn't here.
EMILY: Excuse me. (Emily, holding back tears, leaves. After a pause, Lorelai slowly starts to walk out.)
CUT TO STREET
(Later that night, Rory and Lorelai are walking along a sidewalk in Stars Hollow.)
R: You're awfully quiet.
L: I am.
R: You hardly said anything at dinner.
L: I was chewing.
R: You didn't say anything on the ride home.
L: I was concentrating.
R: So. .
L: Well, I feel I've gotten sloppy with this whole "10 and 2" hand position thing.
R: Mm hmm.
L: Yeah seriously, the other day I caught myself doing a "9 and 4."
R: Mom. .
L: Well, if left uncorrected, that can only lead to a "6 and 12", or worse yet, an "8 and 11", which is not only dangerous but damn uncomfortable.
R: Talk please.
L: I just wish sometimes that certain things could be different.
R: Like what?
L: Like, um, wouldn't it be great if once, just once, I could make my mother hear me. I mean really hear me even if it was just for one second.
R: Are you talking about the room?
L: The room, the potting shed, my entire life after age 6.
R: It's my fault.
L: How is it your fault?
R: I shouldn't have taken her there.
L: Oh Rory.
R: I just thought if she saw how we lived and how pretty it was with the lake and the swans. . .
L: That she'd do a happy dance?
R: That she'd feel included and then maybe . .
L: The whole me running away thing wouldn't be such a big deal? Oh honey, me running away from them is always gonna be a big deal. There is nothing you can do to change that.
R: Can I ask you a question?
L: Yes, I would date Steven Tyler.
R: Can I ask you a question whose answer wouldn't horrify me?
L: Oh, go ahead.
R: Do you think you and Grandma will ever be able to talk about all the things you've gone through?
L: No.
R: You didn't even consider it.
L: I'm sorry. . . . No.
R: Why?
L: Because it would just end badly.
R: It doesn't have to.
L: It would be like the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan but at least those guys got to be in France.
R: You've never tried.
L: Oh no, that's not true. I have tried. I have tried my whole life. But my mother and I, we speak a different language. I talk, I think I'm being clear, and all she hears is 'Blah blah blah Ginger.'
R: But if you won't talk and she won't listen, then how is anything ever gonna change?
L: I don't know.
(They walk into Luke's Diner.)
CUT TO INSIDE LUKE'S DINER
(Rachel and Luke are cleaning up as Rory and Lorelai walk through the door. A man holds open the door for them.)
L: (to man) Thanks. (to Luke) Don't tell me you're closed?
LUKE: Would it change the outcome if I did?
L: No.
LUKE: Two coffees.
R: Yes please.
RACHEL: Any pie to go with that?
L: Oh, pie!
R: We just had cake at Grandma's.
L: Yeah, but that was crabby cake, let's have happy pie.
R: Have whatever you want as long as there's coffee.
LUKE: I'll put on a fresh pot.
(Luke goes to make the coffee. Rory follows him. Lorelai sits at a table. Rachel walks over to her and sits down.)
RACHEL: Hey, listen, I just wanna say thanks.
L: Oh, for what?
RACHEL: For whatever it was you said to Luke the other day.
L: It was no big deal.
RACHEL: It was a very big deal. I was sitting upstairs and suddenly he comes in, empties out his sock drawer and gives it to me.
L: Oh that's great. You got a drawer.
RACHEL: And a set of keys.
L: Well you can put the keys in the drawer.
RACHEL: He's accepting it. He's believing it. And it's all because of you.
L: Actually, it's because of you.
RACHEL: I'm not gonna screw it up this time.
L: I know you won't.
RACHEL: Well I owe you one. (gets up and starts to walk away)
L: So you're gonna be in Stars Hollow for awhile then?
RACHEL: Yeah, quite awhile.
L: Wow, that's great.
RACHEL: Yeah. You want any ice cream with that pie?
L: Well I did get you a drawer.
RACHEL: If I throw in a little hot fudge, you think you can weasel me half the closet?
L: I'll see what I can do.
RACHEL: Thank you.
(Rachel walks to the counter. Rory returns with two cups of coffee.)
R: Here.
L: Ah thanks.
R: Sure.
(They both take sips.)
R: Huh. Does it taste different to you?
L: Yeah. It does.
(Lorelai looks over to the counter. She watches Luke and Rachel smiling at each other.)
CUT TO DRAGONFLY INN
(Rory and Lorelai are sitting on a blanket in front of the old inn.)
L: So what do you think?
R: It's got a great view.
L: Yeah. And good highway access.
R: I love that window back in the . . .
L: Library? Oh no, lobby. No, uh, bathroom?
R: I'd get that decided before you open.
(Cut to Sookie is standing on the front porch.)
SOOKIE: There's absolutely no kitchen space here. How are we supposed to open a bed and breakfast when there's no place to cook breakfast! It's just a bed. We'll have to charge half price.
L: We'll build a new kitchen Sookie.
SOOKIE: I'll need plenty of ventilation. And an area for an outdoor fireplace for barbecues. Plus storage. Where do these people put anything? Ooh! And a pantry. And a canning room. And I'd love to smoke our own meats.
L: Absolutely.
SOOKIE: I don't know if this is gonna work. I mean, I have to do some floor plans. Where is that plumbing? (Sookie walks away)
R: Wow, your own inn.
L: Cool, huh?
R: It's gonna be a really big job.
L: Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get Rune to manage the place for me.
R: How's he doing?
L: He put a tip jar on the reservation desk.
R: Ah.
L: Michel tried to b*at him senseless with the reservation book.
R: Yeah, how did that go?
L: Oh, Rune got away.
R: Really?
L: Well Michel can't run in new shoes.
R: So how long you think before you guys own this place?
L: Oh sweetie, it's going to be a very very very long time.
R: You think it'll still be here?
(The front screen door falls down)
L: I think we got a sh*t.

OPEN AT LUKE'S DINER
(Lorelai and Rory are sitting at a table. Lorelai is in the middle of telling a story.)
LORELAI: So then he starts ripping my twenty dollar bill into like a million pieces. And I'm thinking to myself, there is a store full of people, why am I the one on line with the crazy magician? (Rory yawns) Okay, I'll cut to the end. So he couldn't put it back together again and he had to pay me back in quarters.
RORY: Very good story.
LORELAI: You look tired.
RORY: I just haven't been sleeping very well lately.
LORELAI: How come?
RORY: Just have a lot on my mind.
L: Anything I can do?
R: Flag down the coffee.
L: Arm going up now. Honey, you gotta wake up. Wanna play?
R: One, two, three?
L: I'll go first.
(They both stare out the window.)
R: And one.
(Older man walks by.)
L: Pass.
R: Why?
L: Because I'm not Anna Nicole Smith. Next.
R: Two.
(Teenage boy on a skateboard goes by.)
L: Hmm, pass.
R: Why?
L: Because I'm not Mary Kay LeTourneau.
R: Okay.
(Luke comes to the table while they are staring out the window.)
LUKE: What are you looking for?
L: My new husband.
R: She's already passed up two perfectly good prospects.
L: But I'm feeling pretty good about number three.
LUKE: Do I want to know what you're doing?
R: Hey, Luke came to the table, does that make him number three?
LUKE: No.
L: You don't even know what we're doing.
LUKE: The safest answer in anything involving the two of you is no.
L: We're playing one, two, three, he's yours.
LUKE: I didn't ask.
R: You can take the first guy that walks by, or if you decide to pass, assuming there's somebody better out there, you can take the next guy that walks by, or if you don't take him, you're automatically stuck with the third guy.
L: Got it?
LUKE: I'm not playing.
L: Well of course not. Its still my turn.
R: Okay, guy number 3 is crossing the street right now.
(All three of them stare out the window.)
LUKE: Why am I looking?
L: Because it's like a train wreck.
(They see Kirk walking towards the diner.)
L: Aww, no!
R: Daddy!
L: Not Kirk!
R: Maybe he'll buy me a pony.
L: I wanna go back to the old guy.
(Kirk walks in the diner. Luke walks over to him.)
LUKE: Congratulations man.
KIRK: Uh, thank you.
(Lorelai and Rory start giggling.)
KIRK: What?
L: Nothing
KIRK: Okay, did somebody put the kick me sign on my back again?
(Lorelai and Rory are laughing.)
KIRK: It wasn't funny last week and it's not funny now! I have asthma.
(Kirk leaves the diner.)
R: Mom, quick he's leaving!
L: Oh no, Kirk come back, I love you! Drat. All right, your turn.
R: I don't know Mom. You already got Kirk, how's a girl to top that?
L: You're right, he's yours.
R: And one.
(They stare out the window. Dean walks by. Rory gets a sad look on her face.)
L: Okay, so, we should order.
R: Yeah, ordering's good.
(Opening Credits)
INDEPENDENCE INN
(Lorelai is sitting at a table in the lobby organizing folders. Michel, who is behind the counter, answers the phone.)
MICHEL: Independence Inn, Michel speaking.
MAX: Yes, is Ms. Gilmore there?
MICHEL: I'm sorry, she's busy, how may I assist you?
MAX: Actually, I need to speak to Ms. Gilmore.
MICHEL: Is this business or personal?
MAX: Personal.
(Michel walks over toward Lorelai and tosses the phone on the table. Lorelai picks it up.)
MAX: Is anybody there? Hello?
L: Yes, Hello, hi.
MAX: Lorelai?
L: Max!
MAX: Is this a bad time?
L: No such thing. Where are you?
MAX: I am in the teacher's lounge.
L: Hmm, what are you wearing?
MAX: Nothing.
L: You must be very popular.
MAX: And chilly.
L: I thought we had a chat date tonight.
MAX: We did, but I was thinking about something and I wanted to run it by you.
L: Okay.
MAX: So. .
L: Ooh, hey, make a gorilla sound.
MAX: Why?
L: I want to play Wild Kingdom.
MAX: I am not making a gorilla sound.
L: I'll tell you what color underwear I'm wearing. (pause) Had you considering the gorilla sound, didn't I?
MAX: Yup.
L: I'm good.
MAX: Okay, I need you to be serious now.
L: Says the man with no pants.
MAX: We've been having these very successful phone calls for a couple of weeks now.
L: Yes we have.
MAX: And I think that all the talking has done us a lot of good.
L: Yes it has.
MAX: So I was thinking that maybe this weekend instead of a phone call, we should have a date. Let's have dinner.
L: Hmm, at the same restaurant?
MAX: At the same table.
L: Interesting idea.
MAX: I think its time.
L: You know what? So do I.
MAX: Saturday night, 8 o'clock?
L: Okay, wear some pants.
MAX: I make no promises.
L: Bye.
CUT TO SIDEWALK
(Rory is sitting on the curb reading a book. Lane walks over to her and drops a small bag of chips into her lap. Rory stands up and Lane hands her a small bag from the market.)
LANE: Salt and vinegar.
R: Thank you.
LANE: Here's your gum, your soda, your New Yorker, and your dental floss.
R: Aw, they didn't have the minty kind?
LANE: They were out.
RORY: Well, this is good too.
(They start walking)
LANE: He wasn't in there.
R: What?
LANE: Dean. He wasn't in there.
R: Oh.
LANE: In case you were wondering.
R: I wasn't.
LANE: Okay, well I just thought you might be. So I mentioned it.
R: Well, I'm not.
LANE: Okay.
R: Okay.
LANE: I just thought you'd might like to know for future reference that Dean is not in the store on Wednesdays so you can mark it down on that little list you're hiding from me that says where Dean is so that you can avoid him at any time.
R: I was not avoiding the market.
LANE: Oh, my mistake.
R: I wasn't.
LANE: Okay. So what are you doing tonight?
R: Well homework, and then homework, and if I get all that done in time, some homework. You?
LANE: I have to meet my science partner.
R: Fun.
LANE: Yes, science is fun.
R: Call you later?
LANE: Okay.
R: Hey Lane?
LANE: Yeah?
R: You're sure he wasn't in there?
LANE: I asked.
(Rory pulls a small notepad out of her pocket and writes on it.)
CUT TO SIDEWALK
(Lorelai walks past a store as Luke walks out of the store.)
L: Hey.
LUKE: Oh hey.
L: Doing a little shopping?
LUKE: Yeah, I just had a couple things to pick up.
L: At the cat club?
LUKE: Yeah.
L: You had a couple things to pick up at the cat club?
LUKE: Yeah I did, okay?
L: Okay, I just never took you for a cat lover, a 97 year old woman, or. . . Hey what'd you buy?
LUKE: Nothing.
L: You've got a little bag there.
LUKE: I know that.
L: It's got a cat paw stamped on it and a little cat nip bow.
(Luke hands her the bag.)
L: Wise man. (Lorelai pulls a pot holder out of the bag.) Wow, pot holders.
LUKE: Yes.
L: Little kitty pot holders. (she pushes a button that makes them meow.) They meow.
LUKE: It's a present.
L: For someone you hate?
LUKE: It's Rachel's birthday okay. And don't say anything, she doesn't want anybody to know. She hates birthdays.
L: Not as much as she's gonna hate these pot holders.
LUKE: I don't know how to buy gifts, okay, I don't like to buy gifts. I don't like getting gifts. I mean, this whole give giving and getting process is completely insane.
L: The rant begins!
LUKE: I mean suddenly, on a certain date, the level of my affection for a person isn't measured by the way that I treat them or what we share.
L: No!
LUKE: I mean just because I didn't buy her furry slippers or a giant shoe tree, all of a sudden, I suck.
L: Luke, stop. You know you cannot give her these pot holders.
LUKE: Yeah I know.
L: Why don't you go to the mall and walk around a little?
LUKE: No, no malls.
L: Luke.
LUKE: I hate malls.
L: Ladies and gentlemen, rant number two.
LUKE: They underpay employees and overprice merchandise, they contribute to urban sprawl, they encourage materialism, and the parking's a horror. You drive in, you pay a buck, and even if you're only there for five. .
L: Okay, Emma Goldman, I'll tell you what. I'll go for you.
LUKE: You're gonna shop for me?
L: I've got the day off tomorrow. I was gonna go anyway.
LUKE: You're serious?
L: I'll go get a bunch of stuff, all returnable. I'll bring it to you. You can pick what you want and the rest I'll return. I'll do all the work; all you'll have to do is point.
LUKE: Point.
L: One finger, preferably your index.
LUKE: I don't know.
L: Luke, this is the first special occasion you and Rachel have shared since she's been back. Don't you want to give her something nice?
LUKE: Well I am taking her out to dinner.
L: Luke.
LUKE: Yeah, I gotta get her something nice.
L: So then let me help.
LUKE: All right, thank you.
L: Oh, you're welcome.
(Luke hands her his credit card.)
LUKE: Nothing too out there, okay? She's not into all that trendy stuff. She likes simple, clean nature, okay. Elephants, candles, okay. Oh hey, if you can find a candle shaped like an elephant, that would . .
L: Okay, you know what, I've got it all under control.
LUKE: Okay, thanks.
L: Okay. (Lorelai hands him back the bag with the pot holders in it.) Get rid of these.
CUT TO KIM'S ANTIQUES
(Dean knocks on the door and walks in.)
DEAN: Hello? Lane? Are you here?
(Mrs. Kim suddenly appears from behind a room divider, startling Dean.)
DEAN: Geez.
MRS. KIM: Who are you? Why you call Lane?
DEAN: I Uh.
MRS. KIM: How you know Lane?
DEAN: Well. . .
MRS. KIM: You date her?
DEAN: No.
MRS. KIM: You try to?
DEAN: No.
MRS. KIM: Then why you here?
DEAN: I . . .
MRS. KIM: Empty your pockets
DEAN: Okay, I'm gonna go now.
(Lane comes running down the steps.)
LANE: Dean! Wait, wait.
MRS. KIM: Who's Dean?
DEAN: I'm Dean.
MRS. KIM: How you know Dean?
LANE: We go to school together.
MRS. KIM: You do?
DEAN: Yeah, we're science partners.
MRS. KIM: You don't talk!
DEAN: Sorry.
MRS. KIM: You're science partners?
LANE: Yes Mama, I invited him over to work.
MRS. KIM: Work?
LANE: On our science project.
MRS. KIM: Reproduction?
LANE: Spores, molds and fungus.
MRS. KIM: Science project?
LANE: Yes.
MRS. KIM: For school?
LANE: Yes Mama.
MRS. KIM: You're not dating?
LANE: No Mama.
MRS. KIM: Okay, follow me. (leads them into the kitchen) You sit here. You sit here. I'm going over there, when I come back over here, these chairs will be in same place. No moving, you understand?
LANE: Yes mama.
DEAN: Not you, him!
DEAN: Uh, yes, I understand.
MRS. KIM: I see all. (Mrs. Kim leaves the kitchen.)
DEAN: So that's your mom?
LANE: That's my mom.
DEAN: Has she seen Patton?
LANE: She just gets uptight about boys.
DEAN: I sensed something like that.
LANE: Its nothing personal.
DEAN: I know, I'm sure once she gets to know me she'll. . .
LANE: Oh no, she'll hate you forever. It's just nothing personal.
DEAN: Uh, we should probably get started.
LANE: Chapter twelve?
DEAN: Sounds good. (They both open their books and start reading.) Is this weird for you?
LANE: A little.
DEAN: Me too. I didn't know if maybe Rory told you to hate me or something.
LANE: That's not Rory.
DEAN: Yeah I know. How is she?
LANE: Good.
DEAN: Good?
LANE: Good-ish.
DEAN: Oh.
LANE: Less good than ish.
DEAN: Yeah? How much less?
LANE: You know we're breaking our agreement.
DEAN: What agreement?
LANE: Out agreement not to talk about Rory.
DEAN: We didn't have an agreement not to talk about Rory.
LANE: Well it was an unspoken agreement.
DEAN: Well it was really unspoken 'cause nobody spoke it.
LANE: Well I just think that if we have to study together it would be better if we didn't discuss Rory.
DEAN: Fine.
LANE: Fine. (pause) You know, she can't go into the market.
DEAN: Why not?
LANE: Because you're there.
DEAN: Not on Wednesdays
LANE: Already noted.
DEAN: [Sigh]
LANE: Can I ask you a really personal question?
DEAN: You can ask, I might not answer.
LANE: Do you think you and Rory will ever get back together?
DEAN: Hey, how about we go back to the no talking about Rory agreement?
LANE: Look, I'm just saying that I . . .
(They look up and see Rory standing in the doorway)
R: I should've called. I'm sorry.
(Rory leaves. Lane gets up and follows her outside.)
LANE: Rory! I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
R: It doesn't matter.
LANE: I didn't think you'd want to know.
R: I got it.
LANE: Rory stop. (Rory keeps walking.) Okay, that's the opposite of stop.
R: Lane, forget it. You didn't tell me, now I know. Life goes on.
LANE: Don't be mad.
R: I'm fine. I have to go.
CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM
(Rory is asleep in bed. Lorelai bangs on her door, then walks in and jumps on her bed.)
L: Time to get up. Hey, I have a huge dilemma that I need your opinion on.
R: What!
L: Am I more beautiful today than I was yesterday?
R: Oh boy.
L: I'm just not sure. I mean at first I looked in the mirror and I thought, well yes, definitely, huge improvement.
R: Can I have my pillow back?
L: But then I thought maybe its not that I'm more beautiful today. Maybe I was just as beautiful yesterday, only I lacked the self-esteem to recognize it.
R: I'm gonna go take a shower.
L: Well, hurry up and I'll drive you to school.
R: No thanks. (Gets out of bed and walks over to her bureau.)
L: Why so charming this morning?
R: I had an annoying visit from the Stars Hollow wake up fairy. Where's my tie?
L: In your drawer.
R: I'm looking in the drawer.
L: Hmm. Check the living room
R: Why would my tie be in the living room?
L: Because it's been seeing the doily on the coffee table. I'm sorry, I did not want you to find out this way.
R: Don't take this personally, but get out.
L: Okay, you're crabby. Do you know what the perfect cure for crabbiness is? A fabulous trip to the mall. Huh? What do you say? You can blow off school and come with me. We can shop, go to the movies, maybe talk a little.
R: No thanks.
L: Come on, just this once. It might make you feel better.
R: I feel fine and I don't want to shop.
L: Honey, I know you've been in a funk over Dean, but you have to try not to dwell on it all the time.
R: I'm gonna be late for school.
L: Okay, then just meet me in town around four, and we'll get some Indian food and spoil our dinner. What do you say to that?
R: Whatever.
L: Hey, love the enthusiasm. Hey, does "Up With People" know about you?
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
(Luke answers the phone and takes an order while Lorelai walks into the diner carrying several shopping bags.)
LUKE: Luke's. Yeah. Hang on. Okay. Cheeseburger. Fries well. Vanilla shake. Coke. Yes we have salad. One salad with cheese, one with ranch. Got it, 20 minutes. (hangs up the phone) What the hell is this?
L: The results of my shopping trip all accomplished in two hours.
LUKE: Impossible.
L: I'm a savant.
LUKE: And everything's returnable.
L: Yes, yes, now sit down and relax. Let me show you what I got.
LUKE: Can I have my credit card back?
L: Fine. (Takes the card out of her purse and hands it you Luke.)
LUKE: Looks tired.
L: Where's Rachel?
LUKE: She's out running some errands.
L: Good. Okay, last week we were talking about Meryl Streep and the whole accent thing and Rachel said that she loved "Out of Africa" but she'd never read the book, remember?
LUKE: Nope.
L: Okay, so I was like, "Are you crazy? Isak Dinesen is amazing, I love her." Which is kind of crap because I'd never read the book either, but Rory told me it was amazing, so I felt pretty confident in my recommendation of "Out of Africa". (Pulls the book out of a shopping bag and hands it to Luke.)
LUKE: You bought her a book?
L: No, you bought her a book, to be put in her brand new camera bag. (Pulls the camera bag out of another shopping bag.)
LUKE: She's got a camera bag.
L: It's nylon.
LUKE: So?
L: This one's leather. Beautiful leather. Feel it, smell it.
LUKE: I'm not gonna smell that bag.
L: Fine, don't smell it, but trust me, she's gonna love it. Her old bag is falling apart so she was gonna get a new one eventually and now you will have b*at her to it.
LUKE: So it's practical.
L: And pretty!
LUKE: Well, that seems right.
L: You like?
LUKE: Yeah thanks.
L: Good.
LUKE: What's all this? (gestures to the other shopping bags.)
L: Well Luke, timing is a beautiful thing.
LUKE: It is?
L: It is. So I'm at the mall, and I've already found Rachel's gifts, and I've had two sugar cinnamon pretzels and I'm buzzed on the sugar and jazzed about the purchases and I decide to take a victory lap through Bloomingdale's, and it just so happens that there was an amazing sale in the men's department. I mean gorgeous stuff. Look at this. (pulls a sweater out of a bag) Huh! Forty percent off! I got three different colors!
LUKE: For who?
L: For you.
LUKE: For me?
L: Yeah. (walks over to another bag and pulls out a pair of pants) And then of course, beautiful pants. So soft, I don't know what this fabric is but I think I wanna have its baby.
LUKE: Okay, hold on a minute here.
L: (walks over to another bag and pulls out a belt.) Also, I got this fabulous belt to go with the sweater and the pants. Simple. Black. But look at the buckle.
LUKE: I don't need a belt.
L: Great buckle! Sixty percent off, can you believe it?
LUKE: No I cant. Look. .
L: (walks over to another bag and pulls out some shirts) Oh and I also picked up a couple of shirty shirts in case you didn't have a nice one to go with your suit.
LUKE: What suit?
L: This one! (grabs a garment bag, holds it up, and unzips it)
LUKE: Did no one at that mall notice that you were going through some sort of psychotic episode?
L: This suit. 175 percent off.
LUKE: You were not supposed to be shopping for me.
L: Well I thought you might like a little something new to wear when you take Rachel out tonight.
LUKE: Well thank you but take it back.
L: Aw, just try them on.
LUKE: No way.
L: You might like how you look.
LUKE: I'm fine with the clothes I have.
L: Okay, see this blazer? It was 175 thousand percent off.
LUKE: Why the sudden need to dress me?
L: I just thought you might look nice in some of these things and since they were 600 thousand percent off. .
LUKE: No!
L: Come on Luke, just try something on. How about this sweater?
LUKE: No!
L: Okay, how about the pants? Pretty pants!
LUKE: I'm not trying anything on.
L: Hey, its not like the lumberjack look will ever go out; it won't. But just once wouldn't it be nice not to be dressed like an extra from "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"?
LUKE: Take it back.
L: Come on. Just the jacket. Just once, be too sexy for your shirt and do a little dance on the catwalk.
(Luke walks into the back of the diner while Lorelai chases him with the suit.)
LUKE: Get away from me you mental patient!
CUT TO CHILTON
(Max Medina is lecturing to the class. Rory is staring out the window, not paying attention.)
MAX: If we read his works in order we can see his progression from a narrative of clear simplicity to one of one of rich complexity. Now this is not homework but I strongly urge you, if you have not already read "The Art of Fiction", read it. It's a remarkable manifesto that contains basic trues that still apply to fiction in any form.
(Paris notices Rory not paying attention and points it out to Louise and Madeline.)
MAX: All right, so Henry James, the man of the moment. Pick your book. Read it carefully. A full report on my desk one week from today. Any questions? Ms. Gilmore, any questions?
(Paris pushes her book onto the floor to get Rory's attention.)
PARIS: Oops.
MAX: Ms. Gilmore?
R: Yes?
MAX: Did you hear the assignment?
R: Um no, I'm sorry.
MAX: Henry James. Pick your novel. A report on my desk in one week. You got it?
R: Yes. I got it.
(Bell rings. Students get up to leave.)
MAX: See you tomorrow.
(Paris walks over to Rory.)
PARIS: You didn't take one note. You resorting to the osmosis theory of learning?
R: Why do you care?
PARIS: I don't, just making an observation.
R: Great, we'll build a dome over you and jam a telescope in your head.
MAX: Ms. Gilmore, can I talk to you for a minute?
R: Oh, okay.
LOUISE: Tootles.
MADELINE: Ta.
PARIS: I'll get working on that dome.
(All the students leave. Max leans on his desk and talks to Rory.)
MAX: So, how are you?
R: Fine.
MAX: Seemed a little distracted today.
R: Oh. I didn't sleep well last night.
MAX: You've seemed to be a little distracted for quite a while now.
R: My grades are fine.
MAX: I'm not concerned about your grades. I'm concerned about you. Look Rory, I know that you've been going through kind of a tough time lately and I just want you to know, if you want to talk, I'm here.
R: Tough time?
MAX: Breakups are really hard. We've all been there.
R: How do you know about that?
MAX: Your mom told me.
R: She what?
MAX: Please, don't be upset at her. It just came out in one of our conversations. She was very concerned about you, very frustrated because. .
R: You've been talking to my mom?
MAX: Well yes.
R: Since when?
MAX: Its been a couple, 3 weeks now I guess.
R: Are you dating?
MAX: No, not really, I mean we were talking about possibly this weekend having dinner. You didn't know anything about this, did you? (Rory shakes head her head no) Well the look on your face makes perfect sense now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring this on you like this.
R: Its fine, don't worry about it.
MAX: I'm sure your mom was gonna tell you soon.
R: I'm sure too.
MAX: Okay, so . .
R: Bus.
MAX: Excuse me?
R: If I don't go I'm gonna miss it.
MAX: Right, go ahead.
R: Thanks for the talk.
MAX: Any time.
(Rory leaves)
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
(Lorelai is sitting at the counter. Clothes and bags are spread all over one of the tables.)
L: Come on!
LUKE (from off camera): I hate you, very much.
L: Save the sweet talk for Rachel. Get out here!
(Luke walks out from the back of the diner wearing some of the new clothes.)
L: Excuse me sir, do you know where Luke is?
LUKE: Very funny.
L: Oh my God, Luke, is that you?
LUKE: I feel ridiculous.
L: That's because you don't have the belt on. (Takes the belt out of the bag and walks over to him.) Here.
LUKE: What are you doing?
L: Its called accessorizing.
LUKE: I can put a belt on by myself, thank you.
L: Okay, sorry. Hmm.
LUKE: What?
L: I just. . .
LUKE: What?
L: I just have exceptional taste is all. Turn around.
LUKE: What?
L: I just wanna make sure it all fits. Turn around. (Luke turns around.) Uh huh, uh huh.
MAN AT COUNTER: Hey Fabio, I need the ketchup.
LUKE: Can you get that guy some ketchup?
L: Why me?
LUKE: Because if I spill any stuff on this I won't be able to return it.
L: You're not returning those clothes.
LUKE: Oh yes I am.
(Lorelai gives the man the ketchup. She picks up Luke's suit off the table and walks over to him.)
L: Here, try on the suit again.
LUKE: I already tried it on twice.
L: I know, but I want to see it with the black shirt.
LUKE: I'm not wearing a black suit with a black shirt.
L: Regis does.
LUKE: Okay, you've won me over now.
L: At least try on the jacket again. (helps Luke put the jacket on)
LUKE: This is how you like your guys, all GQ'ed up huh?
L: Its not GQ'ed up, its just a little less casual.
LUKE: And you don't like casual.
L: I like casual fine.
LUKE: Just not on me.
L: No, it just adds variety. Its not lets make a new Luke, its lets see another side of the old one.
LUKE: Uh huh.
L: You missed a loop. Come here. (Starts fixing his belt) What did you do?
(Rachel walks in the diner and stares at them. Luke looks up and sees her.)
LUKE: Oh hi.
(Lorelai looks up and sees Rachel.)
L: Oh hi. Uh, this is not what it looks like.
RACHEL: It looks like you're dressing him.
L: Then this is exactly what it looks like.
LUKE: There was a sale at Bloomingdale's and she. .
L: Six trillion percent off.
LUKE: How can you walk away from that, huh? (pause) I'm gonna change now.
L: Good, uh, I'm gonna get Rory and just enjoy the clothes.
LUKE: I will.
L: Okay good. See you later Rachel.
RACHEL: Bye.
L: Bye (Lorelai leaves)
LUKE: I'm gonna change.
RACHEL: Okay.
CUT TO BUS STOP
(Lane is waiting by the bus stop, holding 2 cups of coffee. Rory gets off the bus and Lane walks over to her.)
LANE: Hi.
R: Hi.
LANE: I thought you might like some coffee, since you always do.
R: Thanks.
LANE: So this feels very awkward.
R: You know, I'm a big girl Lane. I don't need you to protect me from things.
LANE: I just didn't want to make you any sadder than you already are.
R: How is you telling me that Dean is your study partner gonna make me sadder?
LANE: I don't even want to bring up his name around you.
R: That's crazy.
LANE: Have you seen your face when you mention Dean?
R: My face is fine.
LANE: Your face is not fine. Your face is far from fine.
R: I'll get over it.
LANE: Well you're not over it yet.
R: Maybe I'd get over it a little quicker if everyone weren't so busy running around trying to protect me from all the bad scary things in the world.
LANE: Fine, I won't protect you anymore.
R: Great, glad to hear it.
LANE: Next time we're walking down the street and you're about to walk head long into oncoming traffic, I'll just give you a little push.
R: Exactly what I'm talking about.
LANE: And in the spirit of not protecting you anymore, I was gonna tell you that I couldn't study tonight because I had bible class, but that's not true. I have to meet Dean again.
R: Great. Thanks for the honesty.
LANE: And I'll probably have to see him again this weekend because the project's due on Monday.
R: Whatever. I don't care. I'll see you when I'll see you.
LANE: Fine.
R: Fine.
LANE: Bye.
(Lane walks away. Rory throws her coffee into a garbage can as Lorelai walks up. Rory starts walking down the sidewalk as Lorelai follows.)
L: Hey, where's Lane going?
R: Away.
L: Okay, you've been in this mood for a week now and while I love the unexpected ups and downs of motherhood, I've got to say I'm tired of Goofus and I'd like my Gallant back.
R: You can't just say a normal sentence right? Just 'Hey, lets talk' is too dull for you.
(Lorelai grabs Rory's arm to stop her from walking.)
L: Hey lets talk.
R: About what? Oh wait I know. How about you and Mr. Medina?
L: What?
R: I've heard you've gotten back together again.
L: Did you talk to Max?
R: He had me stay after class today to talk about my difficult breakup situation.
L: We are not dating. We had been talking and we just now decided to start dating.
R: Why didn't you tell me you'd been talking?
L: Because it was too much like the whole Todd and Nevina Cutler thing.
R: The what?
L: When I was in junior high, I had a boyfriend, Todd something or other. Not a soul mate, but I was crazy about him and he dumped me. I was completely crushed and I could do nothing except lie around and cry and listen to Air Supply, very low point in my life. Two days after the breakup my best friend Nevina Cutler got back together with her boyfriend, Randy something or other, who had dumped her days before Todd dumped me. And she was so happy and gloaty and couldn't stop talking about how great it was that she had her boyfriend back that it made me feel horrible.
R: The end. Lets go.
L: Look, I didn't want to be Nevina Cutler, okay? You were so miserable about Dean. What was I supposed to do? Walk in and say, 'Sorry about you and Dean but I got Max back and aren't we happy.' Would that have been good?
R: That would've been great.
L: I was going to tell you, okay? I just wanted to give you some space and a chance to come up for air. I was trying to protect you, that's all. Hey.
(Rory walks away down the sidewalk. Lorelai follows her)
R: You know, actually, it doesn't matter whether you tell me about Max or not because you're just gonna break up again anyway.
L: Excuse me?
R: Well that's what you do best.
L: Hey, stop right there.
R: You'll break up, cry, get back together, break up. It doesn't really matter. I'd rather not have to keep track, so tell me when you're down to the final inning.
L: You know what, that is way too snotty a thing even for alternate universe Rory to say. I'd like an apology.
R: Fine. I apologize. Let's go home.
L: Yeah, lets go home and try that apology again.
(Rory is heading home, but stops when she notices that Lorelai has stopped in front of the market.)
R: What are you doing?
L: We need light bulbs.
R: We're fine.
L: We're in the dark. It'll take a minute. I assume you won't come in.
R: Is it Wednesday?
L: No.
R: Well then I can't, can I?
L: What does Wednesday have to do with anything?
R: Nothing. I'll meet you at home.
(Rory walks down the sidewalk as Lorelai goes into the market.)



CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Lorelai walks in the front door carrying shopping bags.)
LORELAI: Rory, I'm back for round two. I got some silly string in case things get really ugly. (Walks into kitchen) Rory? Where are you? (Walks into living room.) Rory? Answer please. Rory?
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Emily and Richard are in the front hallway, both dressed up. Emily is trying to tie Richard's bow tie.)
RICHARD: This is the fourth ridiculous gathering you've dragged me to this week.
EMILY: I'm the president of the board Richard, I have to be there.
RICHARD: Saving the Berringiny pansy. Who ever heard of such a thing?
EMILY: It's a very rare flower that is rapidly disappearing from the face of this earth.
RICHARD: Well, who cares?
EMILY: As president of the horticultural society, I have to care.
RICHRAD: The last thing I need is to spend four hours being bored out of my skull by the same people I'll be bored out of my skull by tomorrow night at the symphony fund-raiser.
EMILY: Which reminds me, we need to get your other tux back from the cleaners tomorrow.
RICHARD: I'll be dead tomorrow. I plan on flinging myself off the roof tonight right in the middle of Pittie Salinger's opening speech.
EMILY: Pittie Salinger is a dear friend and you will be nice to her.
RICHARD: Pittie Salinger is a dipsomaniac. I'm going to bring my newspaper. (Richard goes to find the newspaper)
EMILY: You will do no such thing. Richard, do you hear me?
(Doorbell rings. Emily answers the door and finds Rory standing there.)
EMILY: Rory!
R: Hi Grandma.
EMILY: Rory, is everything okay?
R: Everything's fine.
EMILY: Richard! Richard, pay the cab.
RICHARD: Cab? Who took a cab?
EMILY: Rory did.
RICHARD: What's Rory doing here? Hello Rory.
R: Hi.
EMILY: I don't know what she's doing here. Just pay the man and I'll find out.
RICHARD: For Pete's sake. (walks out to pay the cab driver)
EMILY: Come inside. So tell me, what is going on?
R: I had a fight with mom.
EMILY: You had a fight with your mother?
R: I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to get out of there.
(Emily and Rory walk into the living room and sit on the couch.)
EMILY: Out of your house?
R: Out of that house, that town. Everything. I just had to go.
(Richard walks into the living room)
RICHARD: He tacked on an extra five dollars just for waiting. Feel like I'm back in Prague. Do you want a cocktail?
R: No thanks.
EMILY: Richard!
RICHARD: Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm just a little confused here.
R: You're all dressed up. You were going out. I'm so sorry!
RICHARD: Oh, please, don't be.
EMILY: It doesn't matter, Rory.
R: I'm sorry. Please go out. I didn't mean to ruin your evening. Oh I didn't think! I should've called.
EMILY: Now you calm down right now. You do not need to call before you come over here. You are welcome any time.
RICHARD: Tonight especially.
EMILY: Do you want to talk about what happened?
RICHARD: Emily, don't pry.
EMILY: I'm not prying, Richard.
RICHARD: The girl obviously needs some peace.
EMILY: How do you know that?
RICHARD: I can tell.
EMILY: Oh, you're a mind reader now, how nice. We'll get you a turban and a little booth by the train station.
RORY: Would it be okay if I stay here tonight?
EMILY: Oh, well, of course.
RICHARD: You can stay here as long as you want.
R: Thanks.
EMILY: Would you like some dinner? I can get Rosa to make you something.
RORY: No, I'd just like to go to bed if that's okay.
EMILY: Of course. Whatever you like. Your room's all ready. There are pajamas in the dresser, and a new toothbrush in the bathroom. It's pink with sparkles. I thought you'd like it.
R: Thanks. (Rory gives Emily a hug, then walks over to hug Richard.) Goodnight Grandpa.
RICHARD: Goodnight Rory.
(Rory starts to walk towards the stairs.)
EMILY: (to Rory) Everything's going to be fine. (to Richard) Richard, say something encouraging.
RICHARD: Uh Rory, I'm sorry you're upset, but I applaud your timing.
R: See you tomorrow. (Rory goes up to her room.)
RICHARD: Emily, what is all this about?
EMILY: She had a fight with Lorelai. . . . . and she came here.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Lorelai is walking around the living room on the phone.)
L: Mrs. Kim? It's Lorelai. Is Lane there? Well do you know where she is? Huh. That's unbelievable, you always know where she is. Um, the one time I need you to be crazy prison guard lady you're all, hey man whatever. Um, you know what, I will never be able to explain that to your satisfaction, so um could you just ask Lane to call me please when she gets back. I'm looking for Rory. No I don't know where she is. I uh. . don't "ha" me, you don't know where Lane is either. (Lorelai hangs up the phone)
(Sookie walks in the front door)
L: Anything?
SOOKIE: Patty hasn't seen her but she's been working all day. She's not at the library, and she's not at Luke's.
L: Where is she? Why didn't she leave a note? Dammit!
SOOKIE: Honey calm down.
L: But Rory doesn't take off. She knows it would make me crazy. She knows it would make me worry. I'm crossing over into panic now.
SOOKIE: Don't cross. Come back.
(There's a knock at the door. Max walks in.)
MAX: Hey.
L: Hey.
MAX: You find her?
L: No, nothing. No one's seen her.
MAX: Okay, um, what about that old boyfriend of hers?
L: Dean! Dean!
SOOKIE: On my way. (Sookie leaves.)
L: Good suggestion. You get crisis points. Max, I'm freaking out.
MAX: Its gonna be okay. Sookie's here, I'm here. We will find her.
(Phone rings. Lorelai runs into the living room to answer it.)
L: Rory?
EMILY: I just thought I should let you know that Rory is here with us.
L: What?
EMILY: She arrived a few minutes ago.
L: She's there? Is she okay?
EMILY: She's fine. She asked to spend the night.
L: Okay, um, she's there with you. So how did she get there?
EMILY: She took a cab.
L: Well, let me talk to her.
EMILY: She seems quite upset. She said you'd had a fight.
L: We had a disagreement.
EMILY: She said fight.
L: Will you just put her on the phone please, Mom.
EMILY: I think we should give her a little time to collect herself.
L: Thank you for your input. Can I please talk to my daughter?
EMILY: She went to her room Lorelai.
L: Her room is here, Mom. I'm standing here looking at her room and she's not in it.
EMILY: Lorelai, I did not come to your house and kidnap this child. She ran from you and she came here. She's tired and she's upset. Now I think we should just let her sleep and in the morning we can argue about how to best handle the situation. Maybe a little time away from each other will do both of you some good.
L: I'll pick her up in the morning.
EMILY: She has school tomorrow and her school is ten minutes from here.
L: I'll pick her up after school.
EMILY: Why don't you just call tomorrow when she gets back from school? Make sure she wants to go. You don't want to haul her back home just to have her jump in a cab again, do you?
L: I'll talk to you tomorrow.
EMILY: Good night Lorelai.
(Lorelai hangs up the phone.)
MAX: So?
L: She's with my parents in Hartford.
MAX: Good.
L: Good?
MAX: Bad?
L: Bad, very bad.
MAX: She's safe.
L: She's with my mother. No one is safe with my mother.
MAX: She needed some space.
L: No, that house is not safe. It's like the Amityville Horror without all the good times.
MAX: If it's that bad maybe you should go get her.
L: No, she wanted to get away from me. She wants to be alone. Give her her space.
(Lorelai walks into the kitchen. Max follows her.)
MAX: Are you okay?
L: I can't believe she left me to go there. We used to always be able to work this stuff out.
MAX: What did you two fight about?
L: Oh you.
MAX: Me?
L: Well it started with the you and the fact that I hadn't told her we were talking again, but I know that was only part of it because she's been in such a bad place lately with this whole Dean thing and so, I don't know, I guess it was coming. I just wish she hadn't run away.
MAX: Hey, she will be back and you two will work everything out.
L: You're good at the comforting thing, you know?
MAX: Thank you.
L: Do you want some coffee?
MAX: Sure. Can I ask you a question?
L: I think you've earned it.
MAX: Why didn't you tell Rory about us?
L: Oh, she was just so upset about Dean, I didn't think it was the best time to give her my happy news.
MAX: Okay. But you've told other people?
L: Like what other people?
MAX: I don't know. Friends. Sookie.
L: Um, no actually, I haven't.
MAX: Any reason?
L: Just hasn't come up.
MAX: It hasn't?
L: No.
MAX: You're not by any chance avoiding talking to people about it are you?
L: No, Max, come on.
MAX: It just seems a little strange to me.
L: Why is it strange?
MAX: Well we've been talking for at least two weeks. I would've thought at some point in there it would've come up.
L: You just don't say to people out of the blue, 'Hey, Max and I are talking again.' I mean, I was just waiting for it to come up naturally.
MAX: Well yes, but somehow for me it managed to come up naturally within two days at three different times.
L: Well you're obviously a much better people person than I am.
MAX: I just want to know if there's a reason why you don't want people to know. . .
L: Max!
MAX: . . .then we should talk about that.
L: There's no reason.
MAX: Are you sure?
L: Yes I'm sure.
MAX: Okay.
L: Do you believe me?
MAX: If you said there's no reason, there's no reason.
L: There's no reason.
MAX: So you've said.
L: So I mean.
MAX: Okay.
L: All right.
MAX: That's fine.
L: Uh, I should page Sookie and tell her that Rory's okay.
MAX: That's a good idea.
(Lorelai walks to the phone.)
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(Emily and Richard are at the breakfast table. Rory walks in.)
R: Good morning.
EMILY: Rory, good morning.
R: Hey Grandma, any thoughts on where my skirt might be?
EMILY: I gave it to Rosa to press. Here sit down, have some breakfast. Your skirt will be done by the time you're finished.
R: Okay.
EMILY: Now, we have eggs, fruit, toast, pancakes, blintzes.
R: Anything would be fine.
EMILY: Well, what do you usually eat?
R: Mostly I just grab a Pop Tart.
EMILY: That sounds delicious. I'll have Rosa whip one up for you.
R: No, eggs would be great.
EMILY: I'll go tell her. (Emily goes into the kitchen.)
R: So Grandpa, what's new in the world today?
RICHARD: As usual, it's going to hell in a hand basket.
R: Its nice to have something you can always count on.
RICHARD: It is at that. Would you like part of the paper?
: Please.
(Emily walks out of the kitchen and sits down.)
EMILY: Your eggs will be right out.
R: Thanks.
EMILY: So did you sleep well?
R: The bed was very comfortable.
EMILY: But you didn't sleep well?
R: No I did, I just. . .
EMILY: I talked to your mother last night. I told her you were going to stay here. She said she'd call this afternoon.
R: Was she mad?
EMILY: She was concerned. (pause) So do you get your lunch at school or do you bring it with you? Because Rosa made a fabulous leg of lamb yesterday. I bet it'd make a wonderful sandwich.
RICHARD: Take her up on that. It is good. And demand a slice of strudel.
R: Okay. I demand some strudel.
EMILY: Good. So what's going on at school today?
R: Uh, I have a test in Spanish.
RICHARD: Hmm. Are you prepared?
R: Oh yeah. I like Spanish. Biology on the other hand . . .
RICHARD: Oh, I'm still waiting for the day when my knowledge of the inner workings of a frog's intestinal system can be applied to my work in the insurance industry.
R: Perhaps if you were insuring the frog.
RICHARD: Ah.
(The maid brings out Rory's breakfast.)
R: Thank you. This looks great.
EMILY: Well good.
R: Thanks again for letting me stay.
EMILY: It's nice having you here. You got your grandfather to put down his newspaper at the breakfast table. That's a first.
RICHARD: Aw now, Emily.
EMILY: Well it is.
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
(Luke is behind the counter. Lorelai walks in and sits at the counter.)
LUKE: Geez, what happened to you?
L: A happy 'how do you do' to you too.
LUKE: Sorry, you just look bad.
L: Well I didn't get much sleep last night.
LUKE: Why not?
L: Rory and I had a fight and she ran away.
LUKE: What! Where! Did you. .
L: She's fine. She's at my mother's.
LUKE: Geesh, throw that information in with the first part. You'll scare a person to death.
L: You know, I got in my car three times to go get her. I drove halfway there and drove back, drove halfway there and drove back. I actually ran of gas driving halfway there and back.
LUKE: She'll cool off and come home.
L: I know. Just breaking up with Dean has been so hard on her.
LUKE: Yeah.
L: I just hate that she's going through this. I mean, she's such a good kid. She's so nice to everyone, she cares about everyone. And she's walking around in this unbelievable pain and there's nothing I can do about it. She still won't talk to me. She won't tell me what happened.
LUKE: I'll tell you what happened. That Dean kid is a jerk and he finally let her know it.
L: I wish I could just pinch his head right off.
LUKE: I'll help.
L: I warned him. I warned him when I first met him, if he hurt her . . Ah. Maybe I could key his car.
LUKE: Or better yet, you can key Taylor's car and tell him Dean did it.
L: Yeah. That'd be good.
LUKE: You can key Taylor's car, tell him Dean did it and also tell him that Dean littered and walks his dog without a leash.
L: He'll run him out of town.
LUKE: Good.
L: All right. I should go. Rory's probably out of school by now and I want to be home in case she decides to call.
LUKE: Coffee's on the house.
L: Oh thanks. (stands up to leave) Hey, is that the belt I bought you?
LUKE: Oh yeah yeah yeah. The old one broke.
L: Oh, lucky you happened to have a spare.
LUKE: Yeah. Hey. She'll be home soon.
(Lorelai nods in agreement and then leaves.)
CUT TO MARKET
(Lorelai stands in front of the market thinking about going inside, then walks away. She walks back, then walks away again. She walks back a third time and goes in. She walks over to Dean, who is stocking shelves, and taps him on the shoulder.)
L: Got a minute?
DEAN: Actually I'm, uh. .
L: I just want to tell you that I think you are scum.
DEAN: Gee thanks.
L: You are gonna be hard pressed to find another girl as fantastic as Rory, you know that? She is beautiful and she is smart and she did not deserve to be treated that way by you.
DEAN: Treated what way?
L: I thought you were a good guy. I thought you were going to make her happy. I'm such an idiot that I actually thought you were a good pick. But I was wrong and I hate to be wrong.
DEAN: You know, I am sick and tired of everyone blaming this thing on me. I mean, you and the whole stupid town looking at me like I'm a criminal. I say 'I love you' and she just sits there and I'm the jerk? I'm the bad guy?
L: What?
DEAN: You know what? Fine, think what you want, I don't care. Just leave me alone.
(Lorelai leaves. Dean finishes stacking the shelf.)
CUT TO ELDER GILMORE RESIDENCE
(The doorbell rings. Emily answers the door and Lorelai walks in.)
L: Where is she?
EMILY: I thought you were gonna call.
L: Where is she mom?
EMILY: I haven't had any time to prepare her for this.
L: Mom where is she?
EMILY: Upstairs in her room.
L: Thank you.
(Lorelai walks up to Rory's room. Emily follows.)
EMILY: She got home from school but she just went right upstairs. Now she didn't want a snack but I had Rosa make her one anyway. I haven't checked to see if she's eaten it. She had a decent breakfast this morning but she did seem a little tired and when I went into her bathroom the aspirin bottle was out so I assume she had a headache. Now I don't know if it was last night or. .
L: Excuse me, Mr. Cosell. I appreciate the play by play but I just want to talk to my daughter now.
EMILY: Do you want me to go in there with you?
L: More than anything.
EMILY: Well try and be nice.
L: Thanks for the tip.
CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM
(Rory is lying on the bed. Lorelai walks through the door.)
L: Hey.
R: Mom!
L: Okay, so I thought when you said, 'I'll see you at home,' you meant our home. My mistake.
(Rory gets off the bed and walks over to hug Lorelai.)
R: I'm so sorry.
L: Its okay.
R: All those things. .
L: I know.
R: And then the. . .
L: Its no big deal
R: I'm just so. .
L: I know, I know, I know. So last time I saw you you were headed home, you wanna fill in the blanks?
R: I don't know. I just snapped and I got sick of everything. I wanted to go anywhere.
L: So you picked hell?
R: It was the first place that came to mind.
L: I respect that. Listen, the need to run is a feeling I am very well acquainted with. But we have to be able to talk always. No matter how mad or upset we get with each other our particular special thing only works if we agree to that, get it?
R: I get it.
L: Good. Rory, tell me what happened with you and Dean.
R: I don't want to talk about it.
L: Well I do.
R: Why?
L: Because I had a little chat with him today.
R: What? Why?
L: Well, because I was upset and I was in the mood to do a little yelling.
R: You didn't.
L: Did.
R: No.
L: There he was stacking cookies and I'm railing on him about what a great kid you are and how it sucked that he dumped you, and then he said that he told you he loved you and I started feeling a little stupid.
R: He did tell me.
L: And you didn't say anything?
R: No.
L: Well that must have been rough on him.
R: He looked so hurt. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to hurt him.
L: I know.
R: I just got scared and I sat there.
L: I understand. You know, I'm still learning this stuff too and since I'm still learning, I think I haven't thought enough about what I'm supposed to be teaching you.
R: What are you talking about?
L: I'm talking about my own personal lack of commitment k*ll. I mean, look, I love that you have my eyes and my coffee addiction and my taste in music and movies, but when it comes to love and relationships, I don't necessarily want you to be like me. I would hate to think that I raised a kid who couldn't say I love you.
R: Mom.
L: I'm not even talking specifically about Dean. I mean just generally in life. For example, say you're dating Taylor Hanson.
R: Why am I dating Taylor Hanson?
L: It's a hypothetical scenario, go with it. So, uh, you and Taylor have been seeing each other pretty regularly. .
R: How did I meet Taylor Hanson?
L: You went to his concert, you got backstage, your eyes met across the crowd and you've been seeing each other ever since.
R: Hanson's still together?
L: They're the new Bee Gees. So. .
R: And why would you not stop me from going to a Hanson concert?
L: Hey, someone's trying to make a point here.
R: Sorry. Go ahead.
L: So you and Taylor have been dating for awhile, and things are great, and, um, you're happy, and you feel all those crazy mushy things that people feel when they're in love. I want you to be able to say to him, Taylor, I love you.
R: Okay, can we pick a new hypothetical 'cause this one's wigging me out.
L: My point is that it's scary to be in love, that much I know, but it's also wonderful and special and if you can't say it or fully express it then you're never gonna be able to experience it and I want you to experience everything that's great because you're so great. Are you hearing me?
R: Yeah, I'm hearing you.
L: I'm not saying you say "I love you" at the drop of a hat. It has to be right and real and it has to take a lot of thought. But someday with someone it will be right. I want you to be ready for that moment when it happens.
R: Are you ready for that moment when it happens?
L: I'm working on it. I do however know what dress I'll be wearing.
CUT TO FRONT HALL
(Richard, Emily, Rory and Lorelai are standing in front of the door.)
R: Thank you guys so much.
EMILY: It was our pleasure.
L: What do I owe you for the cab?
RICHARD: Oh, don't worry about that.
R: Thanks for sharing the paper.
RICHARD: Anytime.
L: And thank you mom.
EMILY: Of course. She's our granddaughter.
L: All right, we'll see you tomorrow night.
EMILY: Seven o'clock.
L: Oh really, is it seven 'cause I wasn't sure if. .
EMILY: Goodbye Lorelai.
L: Bye.
(Rory and Lorelai leave.)
RICHARD: Well it looks like it's just the two of us again.
EMILY: I guess so.
CUT TO INSIDE LORELAI'S JEEP
R: I was almost tempted to see if she could make a Pop Tart.
L: Wow, home cooked breakfast, homemade lunch, I'm trying to remember why I left there. Oh yeah, my parents.
R: Funny, funny girl. (They drive by Lane's house.) Hey, let me out here.
L: Oh okay.
R: I'll meet you back at the house.
L: Excuse me?
R: I'll show up this time.
L: I'll have the pizza waiting.
(Rory knocks on the door of Lane's house. Lorelai watches from the Jeep as Rory and Lane hug. Lorelai drives off.)
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Lorelai walks in the front door and puts her purse on the hall table. She walks over to the phone, picks it up and dials a number. She picks up her address book and walks over and sits on the couch.)
MAX: Hello?
L: Now, I'm starting with the 'A's. So first up is Richie Andrews. He's either a second cousin on my mother's side or the guy who regrouted the bathroom. Either way, I think he's going to be thrilled to hear about us.
MAX: Lorelai. .
L: After I've called everyone in here, I'm going to makes sure to spread the word at the inn.
MAX: Uh huh.
L: I thought I'd put little notices in everyone's rooms: "Welcome to the Independence Inn. Max and Lorelai are back together."
MAX: Can I see you after your dinner tomorrow night?
L: Oh I don't know. I have a lot of phone calls to make. Ooh! The Internet! Let's go global!
MAX: Good night Lorelai.
L: Goodnight.
(Lorelai hangs up with Max, then dials another number.)
L: Hey! Richie, it's Lorelai. . .

OPEN IN LORELAI'S BEDROOM
(Lorelai is asleep in bed. She is awoken suddenly by a loud banging noise.)
LORELAI: Dear God Almighty Mr. Mirkle!
CUT TO RORY'S BEDROOM
(Rory is asleep in bed. Lorelai opens the door and looks in.)
LORELAI: Hey!
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You are not sleeping through this.
RORY: Through what?
(Lorelai walks over to the bed and leans over her.)
LORELAI: The freaking Blue Man Group is outside our house!
RORY: I was sleeping through it!
LORELAI: It had to have woken you up.
RORY: No my insane mother Margot Kidder Gilmore woke me up.
CUT TO FRONT PORCH
(Lorelai walks out the door onto the front porch. Luke is hammering the porch rail.)
LORELAI: Hey.
LUKE: Hey.
LORELAI: How are you today?
LUKE: Good, how are you?
LORELAI: Good, good. What are you doing?
LUKE: Fixing your porch rail.
LORELAI: That's right. You are. You're fixing my porch rail. . . . At six thirty in the morning!
LUKE: It was the only time I could do it.
LORELAI: Why? Why?
LUKE: It was broken. I noticed last time I was here. It could hurt somebody.
LORELAI: Luke, we sleep around here. Okay, we like it. It makes us pretty and keeps us from k*ll our crazy friends.
LUKE: You're gonna wake the neighbors.
LORELAI: UGH! Could you pound one more thing while you're out here? Your head! And a for-sale sign on the lawn because we're moving. So that's two things. The sign and your head. And in that order 'cause otherwise you'll be too dizzy to do the sign thing.
(Lorelai tries to walk back in the house, but the door is locked.)
LORELAI: Ugh. Oh sh**t. RORY!
LUKE: You locked out?
LORELAI: You don't exist! RORY!
LUKE: You shouldn't have closed the door.
LORELAI: Ah! RORY!
(Babette comes out of her house in her robe.)
BABETTE: Lorelai, sugar, you're waking up the entire neighborhood. Please!
LORELAI: Excuse me!
(Rory opens the front door)
RORY: I am officially annoyed.
LORELAI: Oh! Well, don't blame me, blame Lu. . .(She points to the porch rail where Luke was, but he is gone.) He was right here.
RORY: Yeah, I know. (Rory guides Lorelai back into the house)
BABETTE: Get her back to bed doll.
LORELAI: He was banging on the. . .
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: It was something on the porch. It was broken.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: I'm not crazy.
RORY: I know.
LORELAI: He was banging on something.
RORY: I know. (Rory pulls Lorelai back in the house and shuts the door.)
(Opening credits)
INDEPENDENCE INN
(The phone is ringing. Michel is leaning on the front desk. Lorelai places a large stack of folders on the desk and starts separating them into piles.)
LORELAI: Michel, get that please.
MICHEL: I cannot.
LORELAI: Michel, we've been over this, we all cover the phone, that includes you.
MICHEL: Don't misunderstand. I want to answer it, I truly did, but today, today I am suffering from ennui.
LORELAI: Ennui?
MICHEL: Severe ennui. You know what ennui is, yes?
LORELAI: Yes. Um, Webster's defines ennui as a lazy soon to be out of work French concierge who won't answer the phone.
MICHEL: Look, I've had my peace with the fact that everyone who calls here is a notch above brain dead, and that the pennies I am thrown each week are in exchange for me dealing with these people in a nonviolent manner. And usually that is fine, but today, sorry lady, I have ennui.
LORELAI: So, you're sleepy?
MICHEL: It's a metaphysical angst.
LORELAI: So, you wanna go beddy bye?
MICHEL: You make light, it increases my ennui.
LORELAI: Okay, that's it. Come on you need coffee.
CUT TO INDEPENDENCE INN KITCHEN
(Lorelai walks in with Michel. Sookie is at the counter looking sad.)
LORELAI: I need coffee. Extra strong. Double cafe. Triple cafe. No, forget the cafe. Throw in the whole cow and serve it to this man right here! (pause) What's wrong with you?
SOOKIE: I don't know. It might sound a little weird, but I think I've got . .
LORELAI: Oh no.
SOOKIE: Ennui.
LORELAI: You explained ennui to her.
MICHEL: She asked me what was wrong with me earlier, so I told her.
LORELAI: Michel, you know that Sookie ends up thinking she's coming down with whatever illness other people else have.
SOOKIE: Nuh uh!
(Lorelai hands Michel a cup of coffee and he leaves.)
LORELAI: Oh no? What was that whole conversation last week when I had to convince you you didn't have a prostate.
SOOKIE: Oh. How is Al?
(Lorelai's cell phone rings. She answers it.)
LORELAI: Hello?
MAX: Is this a bad time?
LORELAI: For the hotel industry, but not for you.
MAX: I've only got a second, but I wanted to say hi.
LORELAI: Hi.
MAX: And thank you for last night.
LORELAI: It was a good night, wasn't it?
MAX: Several novels will be written about it.
LORELAI: I say we do it again, and next time, I'll be the gypsy queen.
MAX: Do you know the more I see you the more I want to see you.
LORELAI: Same here.
MAX: It's like a vicious circle.
LORELAI: It's an achy feeling.
MAX: Like withdrawal pains.
LORELAI: Totally distracting.
MAX: Completely wonderful. Oh I gotta go.
LORELAI: No, don't!
MAX: Okay.
LORELAI: I gotta go.
MAX: Don't.
LORELAI: Okay.
MAX: This would be another example of a vicious circle.
LORELAI: So we should both go.
MAX: We definitely should.
LORELAI: So. . .
MAX: Hang up. . .
LORELAI: No, you hang up!
MAX: Vicious circle.
LORELAI: Bye! (hangs up)
SOOKIE: You look happy.
LORELAI: Oh, well, what's the opposite of ennui?
SOOKIE: Off-ui. Oh, hey, I'm cured!
CUT TO LORELAI'S KITCHEN
(Lorelai is sitting at the table. Rory is walking around the kitchen.)
LORELAI: I had the weirdest dream last night. We were in our house, but it wasn't our house, it was a Kentucky Fried Chicken.
RORY: I'm hooked.
LORELAI: I had to get dressed, but my clothes were in the back. And the guy manning the giant oil vat would not let me though.
RORY: Oh my God! That's so weird. When you said oil vat, that just reminded me, I had this dream last night we were swimming in a pool, only it wasn't water, it was like oil or honey or something.
LORELAI: Hey.
RORY: What?
LORELAI: You totally did the thing.
RORY: What thing?
LORELAI: The thing where one person is describing their dream and it reminds the other person about their dream, and suddenly it's all about their dream and the first person is just standing there like, um, hey man, what about my dream.
RORY: I'm sorry, the oil vat guy was being mean.
(Rory sits down at the table.)
LORELAI: Yes. And we knew him. He used to live in town. He was that guy who used to run the auto body shop before Maven Hughes bought it. Remember him?
RORY: No.
LORELAI: Yes, you do. He's really skinny
RORY: Peter Stringbean?
LORELAI: No. That was the tall circus freaky guy who worked for him. This was the owner guy. What was his name?
RORY: I don't know.
LORELAI: Yes you do. Come on. Ugh. It's gonna bug me all day. He was short and fat and his name was. . .
RORY: Johnny McShort-and-Fat.
LORELAI: Oh, now, don't mock.
(Lorelai stands up and goes out the back door.)
CUT TO LORELAI'S PORCH
(Lorelai walks out of the back door.)
LORELAI: Hey, who was the guy who used to run the auto body shop?
(We pan up to see Luke lying on the roof with a hammer.)
LUKE: The Stretch Cunningham guy?
LORELAI: No, the Dick Tracy guy.
LUKE: Big, always had a half-smoked cigar in his mouth?
LORELAI: Yes, him! What was his name? It was like Jim something or other.
CUT TO LORELAI'S FRONT CLOSET
(We hear Luke and Lorelai still talking outside while we watch Rory going through the front closet. She finds the Dean box and pulls it out.)
LUKE: Always had an ING at the end.
LORELAI: Yes. Uh, Banning.
LUKE: Glanning.
LORELAI: Dunning.
LUKE: That's it.
LORELAI: Ooh! Hey! (Lorelai comes back into the house to tell Rory) Jim Dunning was the Dick Tracy guy. Jim Dunning, that's the Dick Tracy guy.
(Lorelai walks into the hallway, where Rory is standing with the Dean box.)
LORELAI: Oh. The Dean box. Okay, I know I was supposed to throw it away, but I couldn't. I mean, you're young and your head's all weird, and you don't have any perspective because of that whole young weird headed thing, so just please listen to me before you get mad. You're gonna want that stuff one day, when you're old and married, and looking back and thinking, I certainly had an interesting life. And then you can pull out all your old boyfriend boxes. Which is good, because I threw away stuff I'd k*ll to have today. Look, I put it in with the Max box so they could chat and keep each other company and commiserate about how they had Gilmore girl and lost a Gilmore girl and . . .sorry.
(Rory gives Lorelai a kiss)
RORY: Thanks.
(Rory takes the Dean box into her bedroom. She sits on her bed and starts pulling everything out and looking at it.)
CUT TO SIDEWALK
(Rory and Lane walk out of a store. Rory is carrying French fries, Lane is carrying a drink. They start walking along the sidewalk.)
LANE: What I wanted to say was, Janie Fertman, you are a vacuous bimbo who will be turning letters as a profession one day. And the only way you'll know which letter to turn is when it dings and lights up. And I have no desire to stop and talk to you. Ever. But what I said was 'what Janie?' And then she goes, 'You're cheerleader material.' Cheerleader material! Just like that. I couldn't believe it! I almost went full matrix on her. Have you heard a word I've said?
RORY: No.
LANE: I resent that. I'm a witty conversationalist.
(They stop in front of the market. Rory is staring in.)
LANE: What?
RORY: I'm going in.
LANE: You can't.
RORY: I'm going in.
LANE: It's Thursday afternoon.
RORY: I know.
LANE: He works on Thursday afternoons.
RORY: I know.
LANE: We're talking you know who.
RORY: I know.
LANE: Oh my god!
RORY: Calm down.
LANE: Oh my god!
RORY: You're making a spectacle.
LANE: You're getting back together with Dean!
RORY: If you keep jumping like that I'm gonna videotape it and send it to Janie Fertman as your cheerleader audition.
LANE: When did this happen?
RORY: Nothing's happened. I don't even know what I'm doing exactly. Or what he's thinking or whether he's b*rned all my letters and pictures or hates me or what, but I'm going in.
LANE: I so encourage this. I love you, but you've been mopey, dopey, and about 12 other melancholy dwarves for the past 5 weeks and I miss the old Rory.
RORY: I miss the old me too.
LANE: And I've been feeling bad for the new Rory.
RORY: Well she's staging a comeback.
LANE: And may it be more successful than Peter Frampton's.
RORY: Wish me luck.
LANE: Luck!
CUT TO INSIDE MARKET
(Rory walks into the market. She's looking around for Dean but is stopped by Taylor Doose.)
TAYLOR: Rory.
RORY: Oh, Taylor, you scared me.
TAYLOR: What are you doing? You're walking around like . . .
RORY: Like what?
TAYLOR: Dare I say, like a shoplifter.
RORY: Oh, I'm not here to shoplift.
TAYLOR: Well, you currently fit 4 of the 8 characteristics.
RORY: I do?
TAYLOR: You're alone, you look nervous, you're meandering in an aimless fashion, and you're wearing a baggy coat.
RORY: Oh, I tend to run cold.
TAYLOR: So what are you here for?
RORY: I'm looking for your checkout boy. I had a question and I didn't want to bother you.
TAYLOR: He's stacking on six. (calls the checkout boy) Over here please! (He walks over.) Mikey, this is Ms. Gilmore, she needs some help. Take care Rory. Watch her.
MIKEY: Yeah?
RORY: Hi. Uh, I was just wondering, do you like working here?
MIKEY: What?
RORY: I mean, do you enjoy the whole boxboy trade as a profession?
MIKEY: No.
RORY: No, okay, good. So, I'm just gonna cross that off my list. Thank you for your time.
CUT TO OUTSIDE THE MARKET
(Lane is waiting by the door. Rory walks out the door past her. Lane follows her down the sidewalk.)
LANE: Well?
RORY: He's not there.
LANE: But he always works Thursday.
RORY: I guess he's taking Thursday afternoons off now. That's not good.
LANE: How is that not good?
RORY: Because that means he's moved on.
LANE: What are you talking about?
RORY: Obviously he's met one of those Thursday afternoon girls.
LANE: What's a Thursday afternoon girl?
RORY: They're those slutty girls that get guys to switch their Thursday afternoons with another checkout guy so they can go do slutty Thursday afternoon things.
LANE: Okay, you're reading way too much into this.
RORY: I shouldn't have gone in.
LANE: No it's good to go in.
RORY: Taylor thinks I'm casing the place. Like I would ever shoplift there.
LANE: You have shoplifted there.
RORY: Lane, I'm gonna ask you a question and I want you to be more honest with me than you've ever been before in your life. Have you ever seen him with another girl at school?
LANE: No.
RORY: Lane.
LANE: No.
RORY: You'd tell me, right?
LANE: Yes. No, I wouldn't because it would break your heart, but I haven't.
RORY: You swear? On the life of the lead singer of Blur?
LANE: On the soul of Nico, I swear to you that I have not seen Dean with another girl.
RORY: Okay.
LANE: He's miserable.
RORY: Fine.
LANE: Suicidal.
RORY: Good.
LANE: And in desperate need of haircutting.
RORY: Thank you.
CUT TO CHILTON
(A bell rings. The empty hallway fills up with kids exiting their classrooms. Pan to Rory at her locker. Tristin walks over to her.)
TRISTIN: You should decorate this thing.
RORY: I did.
TRISTIN: Well I mean with something other than a bunch of dead black and white women.
RORY: What, like curtains?
TRISTIN: You know what I mean. I did mine up.
RORY: Yeah, I saw that. The naked picture of the Siamese twins is particularly classy.
TRISTIN: You know what these are? (holds up two tickets)
RORY: They look like tickets.
TRISTIN: To PJ Harvey.
RORY: Wow, you have good taste. I'll give you that.
TRISTIN: You're into PJ Harvey, right?
RORY: Yeah, how'd you know?
TRISTIN: Why, I'm all knowing.
RORY: How Godlike of you.
TRISTIN: One of these is for you.
RORY: Oh, I don't think we should go to a concert together.
TRISTIN: Reason?
RORY: It would seem like a date.
TRISTIN: Well it would seem like a date because it would be a date.
RORY: I can't date you Tristin.
TRISTIN: Well I give you permission.
RORY: And on that humble note.
(Rory closes her locker and walks away. She's stopped by Madeline, Louise and Paris.)
MADELINE: Oh, Rory, favor, big one. Look at the face.
RORY: Sure, what?
MADELINE: Can I get your biology notes from Tuesday, I was out.
LOUISE: To lunch.
MADELINE: Please.
RORY: Sure, I have them at home. I can bring them later.
MADELINE: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
PARIS: One more and you're done.
MADELINE: Thank you.
(Rory walks away)
MADELINE: So I've decided I'm now completely into Judy Garland. Did you see the TV movie? Pretty intense.
LOUISE: I think they used my mother's medicine cabinet in that.
MADELINE: She was the Courtney Love of her day.
PARIS: Show me a trend and I'll show you Madeline.
MADELINE: Judy Garland is trendy?
PARIS: Completely.
LOUISE: She was neo-addict retro chic.
MADELINE: No one tells me these things.
(They stop at Paris' locker, where Tristin is standing nearby)
PARIS: Hi.
TRISTIN: Hey.
MADELINE: Ooh, what are those?
TRISTIN: Oh, PJ Harvey tickets.
LOUISE: Really?
MADELINE: Cool.
LOUISE: Who are you going with?
TRISTIN: Rory.
PARIS: What?
LOUISE: Rory's going out with you?
TRISTIN: Yes, she is. (Tristin walks away)
MADELINE: Wow, I didn't think she liked him.
LOUISE: Neither did I.
(Paris slams her locker and walks away.)
LOUISE: Hm, do you think she's mad?
PARIS: What are you two waiting for, a tram? Let's move!
MADELINE: Oh yeah, she's mad.
CUT TO OUTSIDE OF MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO
(Ballerinas are practicing their routine)
MISS PATTY: Flutter flutter, quick quick, flutter flutter, quick quick. And your hearts are broken, your prince has betrayed you, you've been sh*t with an arrow, and now . . you're dead.
(Lorelai walks past the dance studio)
LORELAI: Hi Patty.
RACHEL: Lorelai.
LORELAI: Hey Rachel.
RACHEL: Hey, have you seen Luke around?
LORELAI: Oh, he's probably at the diner.
RACHEL: Nope, he's supposed to be at the diner, but he's not.
LORELAI: Oh, well . .
RACHEL: We were supposed to meet for lunch, but he didn't show.
LORELAI: Oh.
RACHEL: Again.
LORELAI: Ah.
RACHEL: I made tuna.
LORELAI: Nice.
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah, he usually comes back upstairs for a break between lunch and dinner, but recently he's been other places. Uh, your place actually.
LORELAI: Oh, yeah, well, Rachel, he's just fixing some things.
RACHEL: I know.
LORELAI: The porch rail, a couple roof shingles, then the porch rail again after he fell off the roof onto to the porch rail.
RACHEL: Yeah, yeah, he's been telling me
LORELAI: Good.
RACHEL: Look if you see him can you tell him to just, I don't know, check in.
LORELAI: Yes, will do.
RACHEL: Thanks.
LORELAI: Thanks.
RACHEL: Bye.
LORELAI: Bye.
(Lorelai walks by the troubadour. The troubadour stops his song when he hears whistling, he looks across the street and sees another troubadour. He gives a pout towards the other troubadour.)
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Lorelai walks in the front door. She puts the mail on the hall table, then hears a noise upstairs.)
LORELAI: Hello?
(She grabs an umbrella from the front hall. She hears footsteps around the corner. She walks towards them holding out the umbrella. She jumps into the living room.)
LORELAI: Hold it right there! Oh! Oh!
LUKE: It's only me!
LORELAI: You scared me half to death!
LUKE: Who'd you think it was?
LORELAI: Well, I don't know! I heard some thudding upstairs and Rory weighs like ten ounces, and it either had to be an escaped elephant, or some strange large man who should not be in the house. How did you get in here anyway?
LUKE: Through the back door.
LORELAI: The back door's locked.
LUKE: No, that's why I came, the back door lock was broken.
LORELAI: The back door lock was fine.
LUKE: The back door lock was cheap.
LORELAI: The back door lock came with the house. It's been a very fine back door lock.
LUKE: It's the kind of lock burglars look for.
LORELAI: Why do burglars look for that lock?
LUKE: Because it's easy to break into. I proved that.
LORELAI: You proved that by . . .?
LUKE: Breaking in through the back door.
LORELAI: Oh my God!
LUKE: It's the only way I could get in.
(Lorelai starts walking towards the kitchen. Luke follows.)
LORELAI: You have crossed over into the dark side Luke.
LUKE: It's not that big a deal.
(Lorelai walks into the kitchen and sees the broken lock)
LORELAI: UH! You broke into my house!
LUKE: I'm gonna fix it!
(Luke walks over to the door and starts fixing it. Lorelai follows him.)
LORELAI: Ugh! Step away from that lock.
LUKE: What?
LORELAI: Get off. Come. Sit down. (Luke and Lorelai both sit at the kitchen table) You have almost no free time with all your work at the diner, and lately every spare moment has been spent not with Rachel.
LUKE: That's not true.
LORELAI: Oh, she was looking for you today and she didn't know where you were.
LUKE: I'm not hiding from her.
LORELAI: I didn't say you were hiding from her.
LUKE: Sounded like you were implying it.
LORELAI: Well someone's sensitive about the accusation.
LUKE: I think I'm hiding from her.
LORELAI: I think you are too.
LUKE: It's just a little weird having her in my place.
LORELAI: I thought that's what you wanted.
LUKE: It was. Is. I'm just. . I've just been living alone since forever. And I just got use to putting the milk someplace in the fridge and finding it in the exact same spot. You know what I mean?
LORELAI: Oh, we don't even keep milk in the house.
LUKE: Well, then cookies.
LORELAI: Cookies almost never make it out of the car.
LUKE: You know what I mean.
LORELAI: Yeah. Well maybe you can train Rachel to use a magic marker to mark the milk exactly where you left it.
LUKE: It's not just about milk. I'm not used to someone expecting me.
LORELAI: Expecting you to. . .
LUKE: Come home, do things, be with her.
LORELAI: Aw, most people would k*ll to have that in their lives.
LUKE: I know, but I'm different, I'm a loner.
LORELAI: Oh no. No no. I don't want to hear about the romance of being a loner.
LUKE: Some guys are just naturally loners.
LORELAI: Yes, lonely guys.
LUKE: Independent guys.
LORELAI: Sad guys.
LUKE: Maverick guys.
LORELAI: Lee Harvey Oswald.
LUKE: John Muir.
LORELAI: The b*mb.
LUKE: Henry David Thoreau
LORELAI: Every one of these sad and lonely guys.
LUKE: It just not what I thought it would be like having Rachel back. You know, it's not the fantasy I was toting around all these years.
LORELAI: Well, Luke, life is not a fantasy. Maybe you have to lower your expectation bar a little bit.
LUKE: So you're saying that life is just settling for whatever comes along?
LORELAI: Wow, you think having Rachel is settling?
LUKE: No, I didn't mean that. Rachel's great.
LORELAI: And she's crazy about you. And if her worst trait is she's a milk whore, you have it pretty good.
LUKE: Yeah.
LORELAI: And you just need to give this situation a fair chance.
LUKE: I know.
LORELAI: And that starts with ceasing work on the Winchester mystery house here.
Luke: Okay. Thanks.
LORELAI: You're welcome.
CUT TO DEAN'S HOUSE
(Rory is standing in front of Dean's house. She pauses a moment before walking up to the door and knocking. A girl answers the door.)
CLARA: Hi.
RORY: Oh, hi. How are you today?
CLARA: Fine.
RORY: Good, good.
CLARA: Are you here to see my brother?
RORY: Oh, no. No. Not at all. I'm, um, with . . the Girl Scouts.
CLARA: I'm gonna be a Girl Scout someday. I'm a brownie now.
RORY: Oh, well good, that's an excellent stepping stone.
CLARA: Where's your uniform?
RORY: Oh we're not doing uniforms anymore. You know, we're trying to blend in, relate better to the average person. It was a very successful strategy for the Hari Krishnas, so. . .
CLARA: You look like someone.
RORY: I do?
CLARA: You're the girl in the pictures.
RORY: What pictures?
CLARA: The ones Dean has in his room.
RORY: Dean has pictures in his room?
CLARA: There's a funny one of you sticking out your tongue. He had a lot.
RORY: Wait, wait, has or had?
CLARA: What?
RORY: You went from has to had, that's a big difference.
CLARA: It is?
RORY: Yeah. What's your name?
CLARA: Clara.
RORY: You're a pretty girl, Clara.
CLARA: Thanks.
RORY: Now was it has or had?
CLARA: I don't know.
RORY: You do know Clara. Had is past tense. Has is present. Now think.
CLARA: I'm trying.
RORY: Can you go to his room now?
CLARA: He doesn't like me in his room.
RORY: Sneak in, he'll never no.
(Clara starts to cry.)
RORY: Oh, no no no, Clara, don't cry. Oh, I didn't mean to make you cry. I'm a nice person. I'm a Girl Scout.
(Rory hears Dean's voice inside the house)
DEAN: Clara?
RORY: Bye!
(Rory runs away from the house. Dean comes to the door where Clara is crying.)
DEAN: What's the matter?
CLARA: She sacred me.
DEAN: Who?
CLARA: The Girl Scout.
(Dean looks down the street and sees Rory running away.)



CUT TO STREET
(It's nighttime. Lorelai, Rory, and Max are walking down the street. Lorelai and Max are carrying small grocery bags.)
MAX: Okay, we've got food, drink, reading material, chocolate covered espresso beans. Have I left anything out?
RORY: I think that about covers it.
LORELAI: You're such a good provider.
MAX: I try my best.
LORELAI: Are you sure you wanna go to this thing?
MAX: You've been talking about these town meetings for months. I've got to see one for myself.
LORELAI: Well, they're never dull.
RORY: And if you're lucky, you'll see some crazy lady throwing French fries at the people she disagrees with like last time.
MAX: So were they cold?
LORELAI: No, I was just full.
Max: Ah. Oh, oh, I forgot. (Max pulls out 2 RingPops of the bag) One for you and one for you.
RORY: What are these?
MAX: Those are rings. And the diamond is actually candy so you can eat it.
LORELAI: Max, that's very sweet, but we're not eight.
(Lorelai and Rory excitedly switch rings behind Max's back)
LORELAI: What do you got?
RORY: Grape. Yours?
LORELAI: Red
RORY: Trade you!
LORELAI: Yes!
CUT TO INSIDE MISS PATTY'S DANCE STUDIO
(The town meeting has already started. Taylor is at the podium in front.)
TAYLOR: Enough, enough of this arguing. Its time to put this to a vote. All right now, let's see a show of hands. All those in favor. . . .
(Lorelai, Max and Rory walk in. Rory notices Clara and Dean in the back.)
LORELAI: Oh rats. It started already.
TAYLOR: All those opposed. (Lorelai raises her hand) Lorelai, you don't even know what were voting on.
LORELAI: Yeah, but I'm a-gin it!
TAYLOR: All right, the nays have it. Let the record reflect it. Lorelai, I hope that's not food in those bags. Food is not allowed at town meetings.
LORELAI: No, Taylor its not. Its, um, diapers for the little ones.
TAYLOR: What?
LORELAI: Dorsal fins and cucamonga.
TAYLOR: What did she say
LORELAI (whispers to Max): I confuse him till he loses his train of thought and then he moves on. Hot dog?
TAYLOR: All right, I'd like to open the meeting up for miscellaneous issues.
TROUBADOUR: I have an issue.
TAYLOR: Who are you?
TROUBADOUR: The town troubadour.
TAYLOR: The what?
BABETTE: You've seen him Taylor, with his guitar.
TAYLOR: Right, the guitar.
MISS PATTY: Yes, he plays on all the street corners.
LUKE: He loiters on street corners.
TAYLOR: We're two peas in a pod Luke.
LUKE: Scary thought Taylor.
BABETTE: Go on honey.
TROUBADOUR: Thank you. I've been the town troubadour for six months now, and I think I've done a pretty good job and then, he shows up (points to other troubadour).
TROUBADOUR 2: Hey.
TROUBADOUR 1: And there's no room for a second troubadour in Stars Hollow.
MOREY: Clearly.
TAYLOR: This is hands down the silliest thing I have ever heard.
LORELAI: Hear them out Taylor. It can't hurt. (Taylor looks at the bag she's holding in her hand) These are not fries. They are farfignugen sugen dugen.
TAYLOR: I opened the floor for issues of substance. This does not qualify.
MOREY: Note beyond cool Taylor. Music is substance.
TAYLOR: Watch out Morey. After that anatomically explicit epithet your wife yelled at me earlier, you're both on probation.
TROUBADOUR 1: All I'm asking is that the town troubadour laws be enforced.
TAYLOR: There are no town troubadour laws.
MISS PATTY: There ought to be something.
KIRK: I've got the town handbook right here.
TAYLOR: I don't get this people. This man is practically a vagrant. I mean, where do you even live? What do you do for a living?
TROUBADOUR 1: I don't want people to know those things!
TAYLOR: Why not?
TROUBADOUR 1: Because that's part of being a troubadour.
TAYLOR: What is part of being a troubadour?
TROUBADOUR 1: The mystique!
TAYLOR: Oh, this is absolutely ridiculous. Do you subscribe to this troubadour mystique?
TROUBADOUR 2: I run a Kinko's in Groton.
TROUBADOUR 1: You see, that proves it. He doesn't respect the code. You're not supposed to talk. You're not supposed to run a Kinko's. You're supposed to speak through your music. That's the whole point.
TAYLOR: What is your scam buddy?
TROUBADOUR 1: My scam?
TAYLOR: Because if you are using the fine people of Stars Holow to make a quick buck . . .
MISS PATTY: No Taylor, he doesn't accept money. I know, I tried.
TAYLOR: He may not now, but he will. This troubadour act is a money making scheme. Why else would he be doing it?
RORY: Because sometimes you have something you need to say but you can't because the words won't come out or you get scared or you feel stupid, so if you could write a song and sing it then you could say what you need to say and it would be beautiful and people would listen and you wouldn't make a complete idiot out of yourself, but all of us can't be songwriters so some of us will never be able to say what we're thinking or what we want other people to know that we're thinking so we'll never get the chance to make things right again ever. (Brief pause. She puts her hand on Troubadour 1's shoulder.) So give this guy a license. (Applause)
LORELAI: Well, I liked that little speech.
CLARA (whispers to Dean): That's the Girl Scout.
TAYLOR: In the interest of not talking about this subject for another second, I hereby designate 'Mystique Guy' over here the official town troubadour. And no other troubadour may usurp his territory, meaning this other guy.
(Lorelai throws a French fry at Luke. He turns around.)
LORELAI: Do you want some fries? We have extra.
LUKE: Nah, Rachel's minding the store so I should probably get going.
LORELAI: Yeah, I agree.
LUKE: I knew you would.
(Luke gets up and leaves. Max pulls Lorelai closer and gives her a kiss. Rory looks to where Dean was sitting, but sees that he left.)
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
(Luke walks in the diner. Rachel is behind the counter.)
RACHEL: Oh, you're back.
LUKE: Yeah, nothing much pressing at the town meeting.
RACHEL: Okay. Well, the bread shipment's all put away, and I sent Ceasar home since it was pretty dead.
LUKE: Good. Good call.
RACHEL: Thanks.
(Rachel picks up her luggage and walks out from behind the counter.)
LUKE: So you're leaving huh?
RACHEL: Yeah.
LUKE: Were you even gonna tell me?
RACHEL: I was waiting for you to get back so I could say goodbye.
LUKE: Yeah, you at least always do that. So go.
RACHEL: Don't you even want to know why?
LUKE: I know why.
RACHEL: I don't think you do.
LUKE: It's just like all the other times Rachel. You're the anywhere but here girl, you're restless, you're bored, it is what it is.
RACHEL: That's not it.
LUKE: Then what is it? Is there another guy?
RACHEL: No.
LUKE: Then what?
RACHEL: It's another girl.
LUKE: What? You telling me you're. . .
RACHEL: The other girl isn't for me Luke, it's for you.
LUKE: Okay. Now that's crazy.
RACHEL: Yeah?
LUKE: Yeah.
RACHEL: No.
LUKE: You feel you need a different excuse this time to mix things up a little, fine. But you are not leaving because of me.
RACHEL: I'm sure you tried Luke. But admit it, you're heart wasn't in it.
LUKE: My heart was in it. I was here, I didn't leave. . . .I don't get this.
RACHEL: Luke.
LUKE: And what are you talking about, another girl. What other girl? (Rachel stares at him) Oh Rachel, no, you don't mean. . . She and I are just friends. I told you that a thousand times.
RACHEL: No. You told it to me once. And you could barely get it out then.
LUKE: Okay, this is crazy. You've got it wrong here. It's not. . .She and I are. . .uh. . .
RACHEL: I'm gonna go. I'll miss you (she hugs him goodbye) Stay in touch.
LUKE: Rachel, come on.
(Rachel walks to the door and stops. She turns around to look at Luke.)
RACHEL: So don't wait too long okay.
LUKE: To what?
RACHEL: To tell her. (Rachel leaves.)
CUT TO CHILTON COURTYARD
(Rory is walking to catch up with Madeline and Louise.)
RORY: Hey Madeline. I've got the notes you wanted.
MADELINE: No thanks.
RORY: No these are the ones you asked for. The biology notes from Tuesday. The other day you said you. . .
MADELINE: No thanks.
RORY: But. . What's wrong with her?
LOUISE: Nothing's wrong with her Mary.
RORY: Mary? Oh no, not this Virgin Mary thing again.
LOUISE: Not virgin. Typhoid.
(Paris is walking next to Rory. Rory notices Paris staring at her.)
RORY: What?
PARIS: You know, when we met at the beginning of the year, I didn't like you because I thought you were some rube from the sticks and I have no patience for rubes.
RORY: How very enlightening.
PARIS: But then I discovered that you're not so dumb. You even seemed modestly interesting at times. That's when I made a very big mistake. I let my guard down. That won't happen again.
RORY: What is all this about?
PARIS: It's about using people for your own sick ends. It's about making enemies where you should have made friends.
RORY: How did I make you my enemy?
PARIS: Oh I think you know.
RORY: What? Was it setting you up with Tristin? I'm sorry about that. I thought I was just being nice.
PARIS: Oh sure you did.
RORY: I helped you get ready. I loaned you my mother's clothes, which I still haven't gotten back by the way.
PARIS: Oh my God, you're right. I hope those weren't the ones Skippy had her puppies on. I'll check when I get home.
RORY: Tell me what I did. Paris!
PARIS: Think about it at PJ Harvey.
RORY: Is that what this is about? I'm not going to PJ Harvey.
PARIS: Tristin says you are.
RORY: Well, then he lied.
PARIS: I saw the tickets.
RORY: He bought those tickets on his own.
PARIS: Look, I'm over Tristin so don't back out on my account.
RORY: There's nothing to back out of.
PARIS: I don't have time for things like concerts anyway. I'm already lining up my extracurriculars for next year. By the way, are you still going out for the school paper?
RORY: You know I am.
PARIS: You're going to need a faculty recommendation.
RORY: I think I can swing it.
PARIS: And the support of the student editor.
RORY: I'm not worried.
PARIS: Worry. I just got the job.
RORY: Oh. Congratulations.
PARIS: Thank you. And don't worry, you'll have some role. How's covering the new parking lot landscaping sound?
RORY: Peachy.
PARIS: Too bad I already filled the spot for music coverage. You know, record reviewing and such. You'd have been perfect for it. I gave the job to Louise.
RORY: Louise owns two CDs.
PARIS: Yeah. Well, gotta go. Have a really good summer.
CUT TO LORELAI'S HOUSE
(Doorbell rings. Lorelai comes down the steps, trying to put her shoes on.)
LORELAI: You're annoyingly on time again! Ugh. Okay, stairs then shoes, stairs then shoes. (Opens front door) Oh hi.
LUKE: Hey. You're all dressed up.
LORELAI: Oh, I'm going out.
LUKE: Oh sorry. I forgot my toolbox so I just thought I'd come pick it up.
LORELAI: Oh yeah. It's right over here. Rory and I couldn't lift it or we would've brought it to you and then we got used to having it here, so we named it Bert and we'd say Goodnight Bert and it'd say Goodnight girls and we spend too much time home alone.
LUKE: Well, thanks for taking care of it.
LORELAI: Our pleasure.
(Luke places the toolbox on the hall table.)
LUKE: So Rachel left.
LORELAI: What!
LUKE: Last night. She left. For good.
LORELAI: Oh no, Luke I'm so sorry. What happened?
LUKE: Ah, it's hard to explain.
LORELAI: I can't believe it. I thought she was really in it for the long haul this time.
LUKE: Yeah well, she had her reasons.
LORELAI: Really? What?
(Max knocks lightly on the front door and pushes it open.)
MAX: Hello? I'd tried to be late.
LORELAI: Oh and an utter failure at one minute past.
LORELAI: Um, so uh, Max Medina this is Luke Danes. Luke owns the diner. He has the greatest coffee.
MAX: Oh right. I saw you at the town meeting
LUKE: Yeah I saw you too.
MAX: Nice to meet you.
LUKE: Uh huh.
MAX: Mm hmm. So, we should be going.
LORELAI: Oh yeah.
LUKE: Yeah, I 'm gonna get going. I just left my toolbox from when I was here earlier fixing things. I do a lot of little things around here for Lorelai.
LORELAI: Yeah, you're very handy. So Luke, we'll talk later.
LUKE: Yes we will.
MAX: Although probably not tonight. We won't be back until late.
LORELAI: No, I meant not tonight.
MAX: Oh, I misunderstood.
LORELAI: I meant tomorrow. So tomorrow.
LUKE: Absolutely. We see each other most everyday.
MAX: Well sure, you've got the coffee.
LUKE: And she needs the coffee. So I'll see you tomorrow.
LORELAI: Tomorrow.
LUKE: Same time as always.
MAX: I'd count on a little later.
LUKE: Doesn't matter what time it is. I'll always be around.
LORELAI: Bye. (Luke leaves.)
MAX: So are we going?
LORELAI: Uh, yeah. Just wanted to make sure you two were through swinging those things around. Someone's bound to lose an eye.
MAX: What are you talking about?
LORELAI: Nothing. I'll get my purse.
(Lorelai walks into the living room. Max follows her.)
MAX: So not to be blunt, but is that over?
LORELAI: Is what over?
MAX: Whatever's going on that I just walked in on.
LORELAI: Oh Max, come on, that's Luke.
MAX: I kind of picked something up there.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, drop it back on the ground and kick it under the couch, because there is no there there.
MAX: Hey, it's okay. I mean, we were apart for quite a while. I never assumed you joined a convent.
LORELAI: Max.
MAX: I mean, it's not like I didn't date while we were apart.
LORELAI: You dated?
MAX: A little.
LORELAI: A little person?
MAX: No, I dated a little.
LORELAI: Okay. Well, I didn't expect you to join a manvent or whatever the male equivalent of that is called. Who did you date?
MAX: A monastery.
LORELAI: You dated a monastery?
MAX: No, a monastery is the male equivalent of a convent.
LORELAI: Thank you Mr. Medina. I'll make a note for the quiz on Friday.
MAX: I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.
LORELAI: No, I get it. Yes. We were apart. And, uh, you know, I didn't exactly remain inactive.
MAX: So you did date Luke?
LORELAI: No, I did not date Luke.
MAX: You can tell me.
LORELAI: I did not date Luke.
MAX: There was a vibe.
LORELAI: There was no vibe. What is with the questioning? You won't tell me who you dated.
MAX: There's no one you know.
LORELAI: Okay, well, did you date like casual nothing type dating or did you date like get down, soul train kind of a dating?
MAX: Well, I wouldn't have phrased it that way, but to be honest, it was the latter.
LORELAI: Good, good. Okay. Well, I like your honesty. Because I mean you could've lied and left that part out to spare my feelings which would've been unnecessary. So thank you, that was good. I slept with Rory's dad.
MAX: Let's change the subject.
LORELAI: On my parents' balcony.
MAX: I want to change the subject.
LORELAI: Okay, well you started it.
MAX: I did not mean for this to become a who slept with whom contest.
LORELAI: Well, how did it get that way?
MAX: I don't know. Why do we do this? Why do we let it get weird between us just when it's getting good again?
LORELAI: I don't know.
MAX: I don't like it.
LORELAI: I don't either.
MAX: And I'm sick of it.
LORELAI: Well, so am I.
MAX: We can't keep getting this close just to have something completely derail us again. And frankly there's only one thing I can think of that could solve it.
LORELAI: Break up.
MAX: Ugh.
LORELAI: Well, I'm not interested in a m*rder kind of thing. .
MAX: We should get married.
(pause)
LORELAI: Give me a clue as to whether you're kidding or not.
MAX: I am not kidding.
LORELAI: Good clue.
MAX: What do you say?
LORELAI: Nothing. Max, you did not just propose to me.
MAX: Yes I did.
LORELAI: No. A proposal had to be something more than the desperate desire to end a bickering match.
MAX: It was more than that.
LORELAI: No, it has to be planned. It should be magical. There should be music playing and romantic lighting and a subtle buildup to the popping of the big question. There should be a thousand yellow daisies and candles and a horse and I don't know what the horse is doing there unless you're riding it, which seems a little over the top, but it should be more than this.
MAX: You're right.
LORELAI: I am right.
MAX: I'm sorry.
LORELAI: It's okay.
MAX: Let's start the evening over.
LORELAI: Ding dong.
MAX: Oh, now I'm five minutes late.
LORELAI: Well, you're making good progress.
MAX: Let's go?
(Lorelai follows Max toward the front door.)
LORELAI: Bye bye Bert.
(They both leave.)
CUT TO OUTSIDE CHILTON
(Tristin is waiting against the wall for Rory. As she walks past, he walks next to her.)
TRISTIN: So I'm a little tired of this game.
RORY: What game?
TRISTIN: Are we meeting there or what?
RORY: What are you talking about?
TRISTIN: The concert's tonight.
RORY: Well I hope you and the empty seat next to you have a lot of fun.
TRISTIN: I'm started to get a little irritated here.
RORY: So am I.
TRISTIN: What are you mad about?
RORY: You've been telling everyone that I'm going to this thing with you.
TRISTIN: Just a couple.
RORY: You told Paris. Paris and I had just started getting along and now she hates me again.
TRISTIN: Well, the damage is done. You might as well go to PJ Harvey with me.
RORY: Never never. I am never going anywhere with you ever.
TRISTIN: You know, these tickets cost me a fortune.
RORY: They cost your daddy a fortune.
TRISTIN: I don't even know anybody else who's even into this stupid guy.
RORY: PJ Harvey's a woman.
(Tristin grabs Rory's books)
RORY: What are you doing?
TRISTIN: You'll get them back when you agree to go with me.
RORY: You're pathetic Tristin. Keep the books. I'm leaving. (Sees Dean in the parking lot) Dean? (Walks towards him) Dean. What are you doing here?
DEAN: I'm leaving.
RORY: Don't go.
DEAN: I shouldn't have come.
RORY: No wait.
DEAN: I feel like an idiot.
RORY: Why?
DEAN: 'Cause I come all the way out here and I see you with him. That's just great.
RORY: No, Tristin was just . . .
DEAN: I don't care.
RORY: No listen.
DEAN: He's got your books Rory.
RORY: But he took them and wouldn't give them back. Please just tell me why you're here.
DEAN: I don't even know.
RORY: Yes you do.
DEAN: 'Cause I thought you . . Forget it.
RORY: No say it.
DEAN: I thought you were trying to talk to me.
RORY: Oh.
DEAN: I mean, you came to my house.
RORY: That wasn't me.
DEAN: It was you.
RORY: It must've been someone that looked like me.
DEAN: My sister recognized you from the pictures in my box.
RORY: In what box?
DEAN: The box of stuff I have of us. Pictures and letters and everything from you.
RORY: You have a Rory box?
DEAN: And what was going on at the town meeting, all that stuff about writing a song?
RORY: I don't know what I was talking about.
DEAN: That had nothing to do with me? Well I must have imagined it all then. Your boyfriend's waiting.
RORY: He's not my boyfriend. I hate him.
DEAN: Whatever.
RORY: Dean.
DEAN: What.
RORY: Stop.
DEAN: Why.
RORY: Because I love you, you idiot.
(Dean walks over to her and they kiss. Tristin puts Rory's books down on the ground and walks away.)
CUT TO FRONT OF THE INDEPENDENCE INN
(Michel is arguing with Kirk in front of the door. Lorelai comes running up to them)
MICHEL: Do you understand what I'm trying to explain to you? Do you speak English? Are you listening to me? Ah, what took you?
LORELAI: Sorry, I got here as quickly as I could. Hi Kirk.
MICHEL: Do not address him. He's a scoundrel.
KIRK: I'm just doing my job.
LORELAI: What's going on?
MICHEL: Am I or am I not the head man in charge of floral deliveries?
LORELAI: Yes, and one of the few men I know who would proudly declare that fact.
KIRK: I'm just doing my job.
MICHEL: Stop saying that.
LORELAI: This has to do with flowers we ordered?
MICHEL: Flowers we did not order.
KIRK: I'm just doing my job.
MICHEL: Say that one more time and I'm going to punch your nose.
LORELAI: It must be a mistake.
KIRK: There's no mistake.
MICHEL: I did not order these flowers.
KIRK: It says that you have to be here to personally accept them.
LORELAI: That I have to be here? Well that's. . . .
MICHEL: I am head man in charge of flowers.
KIRK: I just do what I'm told.
MICHEL: I warned you to stop saying that.
(Lorelai walks inside the inn)
CUT TO INSIDE THE INN
(Lorelai comes through the door)
KIRK: That's not what I was saying before.
MICHEL: It is a little variation that will still lead to a punch on the nose.
(Michel and Kirk come through the door)
MICHEL: Daisies no less. As if I would order these pitiful little things. Foul things, these daisies. And just a notch up from weeds. And look how many. I mean, there must be at least. . .
LORELAI: A thousand of them. A thousand yellow daisies.
(Pan around inn's lobby, which is filled with daisies. Lorelai walks into the middle and them and looks around.)
KIRK: That's right. There's exactly a thousand of them. The order states that there is to be exactly 1000. Not 1001, not 999, but 1000. You ask for 1000, I bring 1000. I don't question the orders. I merely fill them.
MICHEL: Job well done, Mr. Adolph Eichmann.
(Lorelai sits down on a table in the middle of all the daisies, pulls out her cell phone and calls Max.)
MAX: I couldn't find a horse.
LORELAI: You didn't have to.
MAX: Don't say anything, okay, please. You were right last night. I shouldn't have proposed to you like that. It was stupid. It was the wrong place, and the wrong time, and I kicked myself the entire night for doing it. But you were wrong about something too. I didn't propose to you because we were fighting. I proposed because I love you. We're in a bad pattern Lorelai and we have to break it. And other than that m*rder su1c1de thing you were talking about, which would be illegal and messy, I can only think to be impetuous.
LORELAI: Max.
MAX: No, listen, I woke up this morning and I realized that I have studied and talked a great literature all my life and those stories are replete with characters that let opportunities slip by. But what I teach is more than just literature, its lessons in life. And if I don't follow the tenets of those lessons, I'm not the man I thought I was. The man I want to be.
LORELAI: God, you talk so good.
MAX: I don't want an answer now. I've thought about this. I want you to do the same. I love you Lorelai Gilmore. And I know this to be true. I'll talk to you later. (They both hang up)
(Lorelai looks around at the daisies)
LORELAI: Oh my . . .
CUT TO STREET
(It's nighttime. Lorelai is walking down the sidewalk. She passes the town troubadour, who's in mid-song. Troubadour 2 walks by and the official troubadour nods for him to join in.)
CUT TO LUKE'S DINER
(Luke is standing at a table pouring coffee for Kirk when Lorelai bursts through the door.)
LORELAI: Rory!
LUKE: Geesh, you made me spill.
LORELAI: Sorry! Uh, she's not here?
LUKE: No, what's the matter?
LORELAI: I sent her a message to meet me here at 7 and she's supposed to meet me here at 7, so what time is it?
LUKE: Seven.
KIRK: I'm damp. (Luke throws a towel on Kirk's table)
LORELAI: Where is she?
LUKE: Calm down, is everything okay?
LORELAI: Yes, maybe, I think so. I don't know.
LUKE: So what's going on?
LORELAI: Big things. Big potentially life-changing things.
LUKE: You get a promotion?
LORELAI: Oh yeah, they made me head salesman of the Northwest Territories. No I run an inn, there's no place to promote me too.
LUKE: So it's nothing to do with work?
LORELAI: Where is she?
LUKE: Have some coffee while you wait.
LORELAI: No, I couldn't take coffee, big hole, through the roof, very bad.
LUKE: You're saying no to coffee. This is big. Can't tell me what it is?
LORELAI: I just really need to tell Rory first.
LUKE: But you're happy about this news.
LORELAI: I might be. Maybe. It's just kind of a, wow I can't believe this is happening to me kind of a mindblowing moment. . (pager beeps) Oh there she is! I'm gonna go (hands Luke a daisy) The whole town gets one today.
(Lorelai leaves)
LUKE: Bye
CUT TO OUTSIDE THE DINER
(Lorelai is outside in front of the diner. She sees Rory down the street. They smile and run towards each other. They talk at the same time.)
LORELAI/RORY: You first! (They laugh) You first!
(Pan back to an overhead sh*t of the gazebo as they jump up and down excitedly in the street.)
